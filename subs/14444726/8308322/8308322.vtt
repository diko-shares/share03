WEBVTT

1
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960
You ready?

2
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.000
No, just... Yeah, just... just
ignore the microphone.

3
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.240
Yeah, just... just act
as if it's not there.

4
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.000
Sing as if it's not there.

5
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.080
Yeah...

6
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.040
(German)

7
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.800
(German)

8
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440
Okay?

9
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.160
Ready for them?

10
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.800
- Yes.
- Let's go.

11
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.240
If you're here,
then you already know who she is

12
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.720
and that is one of the most important
musical figures of our time.

13
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.320
Lydia Tár is many things:

14
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.480
a piano performance graduate
at the Curtis Institute

15
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.960
Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.

16
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.000
She got her PhD in Musicology
from the University of Vienna

17
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.360
specializing in the indigenous music

18
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.080
of the Ucayali Valley in Eastern Peru

19
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.760
where she spent five years
among the Shipibo-Konibo people.

20
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.560
As a conductor, Tár began her career
with the Cleveland Orchestra

21
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.400
one of the so-called "Big Five."

22
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.680
A string of important posts followed,
including the Philadelphia Orchestra

23
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.440
the Chicago Symphony Orchestra

24
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.080
the Boston Symphony Orchestra

25
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.880
until she at last arrived here
at our own New York Philharmonic.

26
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.600
With the latter, she organized
the Highway 10 refugee concerts

27
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.720
in Zaatari

28
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.240
which were attended
by over 75,000 people.

29
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.360
She's become particularly well-known
for commissioning contemporary work

30
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.320
from, among others,
Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw

31
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.600
Julia Wolfe and Hildur Gudnadóttir.

32
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.400
And she's made a point
of programming their works

33
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.080
alongside composers of the canon.

34
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.080
She's been quoted as saying

35
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.600
"These composers
are having a conversation

36
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.920
and it may not always be so polite."

37
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.400
Lydia Tár has also written music
for the stage and screen.

38
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.400
She is in fact
one of only 15 so-called EGOTs

39
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.520
meaning those who have won
all four major entertainment awards:

40
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.320
an Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar and a Tony.

41
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.880
It is, as you can imagine

42
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.360
an extremely short
and shimmering list

43
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.400
that includes Richard Rodgers,
Audrey Hepburn

44
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.680
Andrew Lloyd Webber
and, of course, Mel Brooks.

45
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.600
In 2010, with the support
of Eliot Kaplan

46
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.560
she founded
the Accordion Conducting Fellowship

47
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.800
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

48
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.600
for female conductors

49
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.120
allowing them residencies with
major orchestras around the world.

50
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.640
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor

51
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.000
in succession to Andris Davis

52
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.200
and she's remained there ever since.

53
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.840
Like her mentor, Leonard Bernstein

54
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.680
Tár has a particular affinity
for Mahler

55
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.520
whose nine symphonies she recorded
during her Big Five stints.

56
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.000
However, she never
managed to complete

57
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.760
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

58
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.520
Under her direction,
Berlin has recorded

59
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.200
eight of the Mahler symphonies

60
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.880
saving the big one,
<i>Symphony No. 5</i>, for last.

61
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.200
Due to the pandemic

62
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.600
that performance
which was scheduled for last year

63
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.680
had to be canceled.

64
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.280
But I'm told that next month

65
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.720
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth

66
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.560
which will complete the cycle

67
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.120
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

68
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.240
just in time for Mahler's birthday.

69
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.040
As if that's not enough,
her new book, <i>Tár on Tár</i>

70
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.560
will be published
by Nan Talese's imprint at Doubleday

71
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.840
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer

72
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.200
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

73
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.856
All of us at <i>The New Yorker</i>
welcome you.

74
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.280
Thank you for joining us, Maestro

75
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.000
- today.
- Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

76
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520
Thank you.

77
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.600
Lydia, I couldn't...

78
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.920
I couldn't help
but see you flinch just a little bit

79
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.040
as I was reading your bio.

80
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.920
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

81
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.200
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

82
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.400
about the incredibly varied things
that you've accomplished?

83
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.080
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it... it's a dirty word.

84
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.120
I mean, our era is one of specialists

85
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.000
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing

86
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.760
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

87
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.000
Every artist gets typecast.

88
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.800
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

89
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.456
Well, do you think
there'll be a moment, though

90
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.400
when the classical music community

91
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.840
decides not to use
sexual distinctions

92
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.440
to differentiate artists?

93
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.240
I'm probably the wrong person to ask
since I don't read reviews.

94
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.640
- Never, really?
- No.

95
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.000
But it is odd, I... I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

96
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.640
to substitute "maestro"
with "maestra."

97
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.360
I mean, we don't call
women astronauts "astronettes."

98
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440
Right.

99
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.000
But as to the question of gender bias

100
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.680
I really have nothing
to complain about.

101
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.720
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta

102
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.920
Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

103
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.840
I mean, there's so many
incredible women who came before us.

104
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.280
You know, women who did
the... the real lifting.

105
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.920
That... that's fascinating.
Can you... Who, for instance?

106
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.680
Okay, sure.

107
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.880
First and foremost, Nadia Boulanger.

108
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.640
I mean, that would be
the... happy example.

109
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.840
The sad one would be Antonia Brico

110
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.680
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

111
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.000
but was ghettoized

112
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.520
into the non-glamorous status
of a "guest conductor"

113
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.520
and essentially treated as a dog act.

114
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.800
A dog... She never got the chance
to lead a major orchestra?

115
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.640
Well, yes. Yes, she did conduct

116
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.920
the Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met

117
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.640
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

118
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.896
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

119
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.000
it was all gender spectacle.

120
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.480
But fortunately, times change

121
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.840
and... and the Pauline
conversion is...

122
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.976
- "Pauline..."
- if not complete

123
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.720
then it's... it's evolving nicely.

124
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.400
N-No less
having fallen off its horse.

125
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.160
Lydia, could we talk a little bit
about translation?

126
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.656
'Cause I think there's still people

127
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.640
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

128
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.960
Well, yeah,
that's... that's partly true.

129
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.800
- Yeah, but it's...
- But keeping time

130
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.760
it's... it's no small thing.

131
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.256
But I suspect
there's a lot more to it than that.

132
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.736
Yeah, well,
I... I would hope so, yes.

133
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.200
But time is the thing.

134
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.760
Time is... is the essential piece
of interpretation.

135
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.440
You cannot start without me.

136
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.280
See, I start the clock.

137
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.760
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand, the second hand

138
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.720
marks time and moves it forward.

139
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.400
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops

140
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.760
which means that time stops.

141
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.440
Now, the illusion is that like you,
I'm responding to the orchestra

142
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.056
- in real time, making the decision
- Right, right.

143
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.400
About the right moment
to restart the thing, or reset it

144
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.120
or throw time out
the window altogether.

145
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.200
The reality is that
right from the very beginning

146
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.600
- I know precisely what time it is
- Really?

147
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.840
And the exact moment

148
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.880
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

149
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.880
You know, the only real discovery
for me is in rehearsal.

150
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.000
It's never, never in performance.

151
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.640
Hard question, I know

152
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.240
but if you could define one thing
that Bernstein gave you

153
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.360
what would it be?

154
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.520
Kavvanah.

155
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.280
Yeah, it's... it's the Hebrew word

156
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.000
for attention to meaning
or... or intent.

157
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.656
You know, what are
the composer's priorities

158
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.000
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

159
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.160
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

160
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.320
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

161
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.600
Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

162
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.176
Am I right in thinking that

163
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.600
a conductor was not always
an onstage presence

164
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.736
- in classical music?
- No, that's right.

165
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.920
I... I think I read someplace

166
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.640
that it actually was
the first violin, for a long time

167
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.816
- who was responsible.
- Yes, the first violinist

168
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.800
whether they had any interest
or... or skill in it or not.

169
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.200
W-when did that change,
and... and who changed it?

170
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.920
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully

171
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.360
who reportedly used
a rather enormous rather pointy staff

172
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.440
to pound the tempi into the floor.

173
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.000
It's not something I imagine
the players particularly appreciated.

174
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.600
Anyway, that technique ended
during a performance

175
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.760
when Lully accidentally

176
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.880
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

177
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.960
Yeah, of... of gangrene.

178
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040
But anyway...

179
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.680
Yeah.

180
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.280
Anyway, but the conductor

181
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.000
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

182
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.560
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

183
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.440
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

184
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.720
The downbeat...

185
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.440
it's silent, right?

186
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.720
So someone had to start that clock.

187
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.880
Someone had to plant
their flag in the sand

188
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.400
and say, "Follow me," you know?

189
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.720
And when that someone was Lenny,
the orchestra was led

190
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.800
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

191
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.720
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially

192
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.840
as well or better than anyone.

193
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.680
And he would often play
with the form.

194
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.176
'Cause he wanted an orchestra to feel

195
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.640
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

196
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.200
or... or performed any of that music.

197
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.320
So he... he would do radical things

198
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.600
like disregarding the tempo primo

199
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.160
or... or ending this phrase
molto ritardando

200
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.200
even though it had no such marking.

201
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.560
Was he over-egging it?

202
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.000
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

203
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.600
He... he celebrated
the joy of his discovery.

204
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.520
You told us a moment ago

205
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.000
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

206
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.800
When will that process
begin again for you?

207
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.240
We start on Monday.

208
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.760
Immediately?

209
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.760
With this one, it really is about

210
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.720
trying to read the tea leaves
of... of Mahler's intention.

211
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.240
I mean, we know a great deal
about this with his other symphonies.

212
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.336
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

213
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.640
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

214
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.360
But all of this changes
with the Five.

215
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.840
The Five is a mystery.

216
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:51.560
And the only clue he leaves us

217
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.400
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

218
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.000
Yes, the... the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

219
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.520
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler on his fifth symphony

220
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.520
the first thing you must do

221
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.160
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

222
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.336
And would you say that you have

223
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.200
a different interpretation
of that marriage than Bernstein did?

224
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.200
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

225
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.920
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo
only receive an icaro, or song

226
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.720
if the singer is there, right?

227
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.400
On the same side of the... the spirit
that... that created it.

228
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.680
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

229
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.720
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

230
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.160
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

231
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.360
But Lenny, he believed in teshuvah.

232
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.600
The... the Talmudic power
to reach back into time

233
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.720
and... and transform the significance
of one's past deeds.

234
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.600
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral

235
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200
it ran for 12 minutes.

236
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.200
He treated it as a mass.

237
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.520
And, you know,
if you listen to a recording of it

238
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.120
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and... and the pathos.

239
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.600
And of course that interpretation was
very true for Mahler later in life

240
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.520
after the professional bottom
dropped out

241
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.400
and Alma had left him for Gropius.

242
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.440
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

243
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.680
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

244
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.280
It was born into young love.

245
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.680
And so you chose...

246
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.560
Love.

247
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.400
Right, but precisely how long?

248
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.960
Well...

249
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.320
seven minutes.

250
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.880
I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

251
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.160
about interpretation

252
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.200
and specifically about feelings,
and that you chose love.

253
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.600
And I know it's said that

254
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.200
you should leave the tears
for the audience, but...

255
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.040
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

256
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.336
when you're up there at the podium?

257
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.400
Yes.

258
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.520
Yes, that does happen.

259
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.000
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

260
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.160
with some works and the spots in them

261
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.040
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting

262
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.040
it's not that I'm rushing exactly

263
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.600
but I just can't wait
to get to that spot

264
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.200
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

265
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.720
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

266
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.280
God, it must take hours
to come back down to earth.

267
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.520
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

268
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.000
And sleep, it's impossible.

269
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.880
It's like my freshman year at Smith.

270
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.680
Which piece does that to you?

271
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.320
Oh, I saw you.

272
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.880
I saw you conduct The Rite of Spring
at the Met last year.

273
00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.920
It was so powerful.

274
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.280
Thank you.

275
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.640
Thank you. It's...

276
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.000
It's the 11 pistol shots...
it's a prime number...

277
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.600
that strike you
as both victim and perpetrator.

278
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.176
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

279
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.640
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

280
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.280
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

281
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.360
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

282
00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.320
Oh, I do. I do.

283
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.760
Sorry. Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.
His driver is waiting.

284
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.840
All right.

285
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.456
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

286
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.920
- Whitney. Whitney Reese.
- Whitney.

287
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.400
Whitney, of course.
I'm... I'm so sorry

288
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.096
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

289
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.176
and there's something
I can't get out of.

290
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.120
I understand. Can I text you?

291
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.360
It's perfect, Aldo.

292
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.080
Oh. I was hoping we could celebrate.

293
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.680
No. So was I.

294
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.600
I've got a class at Juilliard.

295
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.680
Oh, good.

296
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.760
I promised Ben.

297
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.400
I'm sure you'll have a few elbowing
for an Accordion slot.

298
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
We should open up the fellowship.

299
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.600
- What, expand our numbers?
- No, our sex.

300
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.760
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

301
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.000
We've made our point.

302
00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.640
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

303
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.400
successfully placing any of them.

304
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
Except one.

305
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.440
Oh, well.

306
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.520
She had issues.

307
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.920
So I've heard.

308
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.720
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

309
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.800
with her father.

310
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.320
I'm sorry about that.

311
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.520
It's fine.

312
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.320
It's nothing I can't handle.

313
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.360
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

314
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.560
We'd likely lose donors.

315
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.000
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

316
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.840
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit down the line.

317
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.920
Sure.

318
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.800
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

319
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.600
Nan asked me to help fill the place

320
00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.880
so the Kaplan Fund is gonna buy
some radio and outdoor advertising.

321
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.920
And claqueurs.

322
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.080
It's too big, Eliot.
She should have booked the Strand.

323
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.520
Relax.

324
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.040
It'll be great.

325
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.760
And it almost falls on your birthday.

326
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.760
I was... I was sorry

327
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.080
you weren't able to make it
to my Mahler Three in London.

328
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
Me, too.

329
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.880
Petra had a school thing.

330
00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.760
And I promised Sharon I'd be there.

331
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800
Of course.

332
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.320
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

333
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.200
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

334
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.600
Those are confidential, Eliot.

335
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.640
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

336
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.320
On the way back, I was listening
to yours with the Israeli Phil

337
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.096
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

338
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.880
from the strings
in the last movement.

339
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.200
I mean, how did you get them there?

340
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040
Was it the hall?

341
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.360
Was it the players?

342
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.480
The players weren't very obliging.

343
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.600
The principal violinist came up to me
after the first rehearsal

344
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.800
- and asked if I was a Jew.
- What?

345
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.840
It seemed to him unusual,
if not suspicious

346
00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.680
that a non-Jew would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

347
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.920
Felt like Max Bruch.

348
00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.120
Well, big Jew that I am

349
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.000
the Kaplan Fund has

350
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.720
committed a sizable amount to them
for a klezmer commission.

351
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.256
Maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

352
00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.800
Oh, well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

353
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.400
Oh, please.

354
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.200
I know my place.

355
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.000
Money can't always
buy you everything.

356
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:18.000
You don't really believe that.

357
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.800
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

358
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.160
to let me look at your notation.

359
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.360
She sent me packing.

360
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.120
Good girl.

361
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.696
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

362
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.000
is urgently focused on our table.

363
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.080
At first, I thought
he was looking at me

364
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.000
but I think he's got his eye on you.

365
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.880
Please try and ignore him.

366
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.600
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

367
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.840
if you'd like to be alone.

368
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.360
And I would never forgive you.

369
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.920
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

370
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.560
by someone exactly like me.

371
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:50.760
What time are you leaving tomorrow?

372
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.760
Francesca's looking into flights.

373
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.400
Well, call her off.

374
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.760
Leave when you like.

375
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.840
You don't have to do that.

376
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.800
My motives are not
entirely altruistic.

377
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.200
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

378
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960
Fine.

379
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.720
Would 5:15 be okay?

380
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.240
- Sure.
- Okay, I mean, I do...

381
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:14.800
I have to get turned around fast.

382
00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.920
We're filling a vacant position.

383
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.120
Oh, please tell me it's Sebastian.

384
00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.680
Now, be fair, Eliot.
Sebastian has decent technique.

385
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.120
He has baton.

386
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.000
A month ago, I dropped into Bunkamura

387
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.400
to watch the touring machine
trot out Chopin 1.

388
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.160
Ol' Sebastian really is
Mr. Tempo Rubato.

389
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.120
Robot-o is more like it.

390
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.200
Why do you keep him on?

391
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.400
Oh, he's Andris's man, you know that.

392
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.080
Exactly. You inherited that decision.

393
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.216
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

394
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.240
They have different
labor contracts over there.

395
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:48.120
He's a... he's a strange guy.

396
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.680
Who? Andris?

397
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.120
No, Sebastian.

398
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.840
He has... fetishes.

399
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.680
Fetishes? Like what?

400
00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.000
Nostalgia for pre-war
Kalmus miniature scores

401
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:03.480
dead-stock pencils he's seen
von Karajan hold in photographs.

402
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.120
You know, that sort of thing.

403
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.400
That's just sad.

404
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.160
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

405
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.480
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

406
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320
For who?

407
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.000
<i>What Love Teaches Me.</i>

408
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.760
That string notation.

409
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.200
Mahler gives it to you himself.

410
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.320
{\an5}- Come on.
- Trust me.

411
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.720
You do not want to go to school

412
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.520
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

413
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.360
Least of all, mine.

414
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.880
Oh, but I do.

415
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.440
All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

416
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480
Yes.

417
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.120
Free bowing.

418
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.560
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at

419
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.120
but if you can manage to keep
your players out of the weeds...

420
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.040
the sound's ferocious.

421
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.680
There's no glory for a robot, Eliot.

422
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.120
Do your own thing.

423
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.320
All right...

424
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.040
Let's... stop here.

425
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.920
- Thank you, Max. Very good.
- Thanks.

426
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.880
Just for my own edification...

427
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.680
why did you come to Juilliard?

428
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.120
It's the best music conservatory
in the country?

429
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.800
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

430
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.200
I mean, Juilliard's a brand, right?

431
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.320
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

432
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.480
- No.
- No, right.

433
00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.880
So there's a teacher or graduate
somewhere down the line

434
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.056
who, you know, conjured
something in your imagination.

435
00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.800
Someone you aspire to be yourself.

436
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.960
So, who was that?

437
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.080
Sarah Chang.

438
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.120
So you're a violinist?

439
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.800
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

440
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.160
Well, I can see why you would choose
to conduct a piece like this.

441
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.880
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

442
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.200
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

443
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.840
Now...

444
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.880
this piece is very au courant.

445
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.080
I mean, here, the composer tells us

446
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.960
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes with wire brush

447
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.400
and slowly sliding
crotales over skin."

448
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.400
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

449
00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.280
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

450
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.360
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

451
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.880
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

452
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.880
Now, I know you're all
conducting students of Mr. Wolfe's

453
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.720
but how many of you
are also studying composition?

454
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.760
Right, what's your name?

455
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.880
Olive Kerr.

456
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.720
All right, Olive.

457
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.240
What do you make of
what we've just been listening to?

458
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.920
It's pretty awesome.

459
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.000
I mean, there's
incredible atonal tension.

460
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.320
I agree about the tension part.

461
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.280
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate

462
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.800
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal"

463
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.280
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

464
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.520
What is the effect?
What is it actually doing to me?

465
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.040
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

466
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.120
or bare as a potting shed

467
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.600
so long as it allows you
to answer both those questions.

468
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920
Max.

469
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.320
Come on, what do you think?

470
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.400
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class

471
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.200
she said she was often
influenced by the form

472
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:03.800
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

473
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.840
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

474
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.960
in describing those actual sounds.

475
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.880
Very Punkt Kontra Punkt.

476
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
Yes.

477
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.120
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

478
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.960
So, if her intent is vague

479
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.400
how do you, as a conductor,
have a point of view about anything?

480
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.520
Now, to be fair, I mean

481
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.840
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

482
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.440
And you will be made
to stand in front of an orchestra

483
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.600
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

484
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.240
But my prayer for you

485
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.800
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

486
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.880
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33"

487
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.200
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

488
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.720
Because now, my friends,
now is the time to conduct music

489
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.520
that actually requires
something of you.

490
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.480
You know, music that everybody knows

491
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.320
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

492
00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.320
For instance, Max, why not a Kyrie?

493
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.520
You know, like, something
like Bach's Mass in B minor.

494
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.320
I'm not really into Bach.

495
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.760
You're not into Bach?

496
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:17.760
Oh, Max.

497
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.360
Have you read the Schweitzer book?

498
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440
No.

499
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.200
Well, you should.

500
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.120
It's an important text.

501
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.880
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

502
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.960
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

503
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.720
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

504
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.520
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

505
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.976
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her in a...

506
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.520
in a pith helmet.

507
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600
I mean, have you...

508
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.520
have you ever played
or... or conducted Bach?

509
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.120
Honestly,
as a BIPOC, pangender person

510
00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:57.000
I would say Bach's misogynistic life
makes it kind of impossible for me

511
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.760
to take his music seriously.

512
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960
Come on.

513
00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.880
What do... what do you...
what do you mean by that?

514
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:09.160
Well, didn't he sire, like, 20 kids?

515
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.880
Yes, that's documented.

516
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.800
Along with
a considerable amount of music.

517
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.360
But I'm sorry, I'm...

518
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.720
I'm unclear as to what his
prodigious skills in the marital bed

519
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.320
have to do with B minor.

520
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.040
Sure.

521
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.520
All right, whatever.
That's... that's your choice.

522
00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.960
I mean, after all,
"a soul selects her own society."

523
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.520
But remember,
the flip side of that selection

524
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.880
closes the valves of one's attention.

525
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.880
Now, of course, siloing
what is acceptable or not acceptable

526
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.080
is a basic construct of many, if not
most, symphony orchestras today

527
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.720
who see it as their imperial right
to curate for the cretins.

528
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.440
So, slippery as it is

529
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.920
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

530
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.880
Can classical music

531
00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.360
written by a bunch of straight,
Austro-German, churchgoing white guys

532
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.640
exalt us

533
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.600
individually
as... as well as collectively

534
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.280
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

535
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.520
You know, what about Beethoven?

536
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120
You into him?

537
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.480
Because for me, as a U-Haul lesbian

538
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.400
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

539
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.240
But then, I face him.

540
00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:27.800
And I find myself nose-to-nose
with his magnitude and inevitability.

541
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.480
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

542
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.800
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

543
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.880
Sit.

544
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.080
Now, this is all filigree, right?

545
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.200
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

546
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.400
<i>Or Schroeder playing for Lucy</i>

547
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.200
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

548
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.040
Now, it's not until it changes...

549
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.000
you get inside it,
that you hear what it really is.

550
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.240
It's a question.

551
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.560
And an answer.

552
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.000
Which begs another question.

553
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.520
There's a humility in Bach.

554
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.680
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

555
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.560
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

556
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.200
that involves the listener.

557
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.680
It's never the answer, right?

558
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.480
Now, the big question for you

559
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.400
is: What do you think, Max?

560
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.920
You play really well.

561
00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:58.760
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

562
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.760
Don't be so eager to be offended.

563
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.880
The narcissism of small differences
leads to the most boring conformity.

564
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.480
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

565
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.320
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

566
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:16.040
Oh, well, then you must be aware
that Varèse once famously stated

567
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.800
that jazz was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

568
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.520
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith

569
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.200
from ripping him off
for his <i>Planet of the Apes</i> score.

570
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.560
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

571
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.600
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

572
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.040
as an ultrasonic epistemic dissident

573
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.280
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced

574
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.160
to his gender, birth country,
religion, sexuality, and so on

575
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.640
then so can yours.

576
00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.480
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

577
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.600
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra

578
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.840
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

579
00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.520
and music on their stands.

580
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.920
They will also have been
handed rating sheets

581
00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.680
the purpose of which is to rate you.

582
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.640
Now, what kind of criteria would you
hope that they would use to do this?

583
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.920
Your score reading and
stick technique, or something else?

584
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.360
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria

585
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.920
let's consider Max's thing.

586
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.160
In this case, Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

587
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.280
Now, can we agree
on two pieces of observation?

588
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.880
One, that Anna was born in Iceland.

589
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.160
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know

590
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.600
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

591
00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.760
Show of hands.

592
00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.600
All right, now let's turn our gaze
back to the piano bench up there

593
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.640
and see if we can square
how any of those things

594
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.720
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

595
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.800
Oh, where are you going?

596
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.920
You're a fucking bitch.

597
00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:59.000
And you are a robot.

598
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.680
I mean, unfortunately

599
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.160
the architect of your soul
appears to be social media.

600
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.920
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

601
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:11.560
You gotta sublimate yourself,
your ego, and, yes, your identity.

602
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.320
You must, in fact, stand
in front of the public and God

603
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.800
and obliterate yourself.

604
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.680
All right.

605
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.200
During the lockdown, you did
something I thought remarkable.

606
00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.920
You made music for free.

607
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.000
Anyone at all could stream
Berlin performances

608
00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.720
without ever paying a dime.

609
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.920
Well, that... that was a...

610
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.240
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

611
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.480
And though I... I wish I could
claim the idea was mine

612
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.400
it really did spring
from the heart of Sharon Goodnow.

613
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.560
Sharon is your partner.
You have a child together

614
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.080
and she's also the concertmaster
for Berlin. Does that ever...

615
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.160
- Yes, that's right.
- Complicate things for you?

616
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.480
Your work getting into your home
or the other way ar...

617
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.160
Jake said he was certain you'd be
happy with the drape of the seat.

618
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.480
I will be

619
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.800
if I can keep the fat off
until next month.

620
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.680
You never gain weight.

621
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.080
Your... your mother texted me.

622
00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.400
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

623
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.760
Next trip.

624
00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.000
What are you thinking for dinner?

625
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.640
No.

626
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.040
No, I'm... I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

627
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.320
I'm suspicious
of the E natural in the cello line.

628
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.840
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

629
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.000
Not... not at all.

630
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.480
But don't worry, I'll call Houston.

631
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.800
They'll be flexible.

632
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.400
You must have some New Haven friends
you want to see tonight?

633
00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.000
No. Not really.

634
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.920
Should I stop by later for notes?

635
00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.880
No, that won't be necessary.

636
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320
Okay.

637
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.160
Oh, I... I almost forgot, but...

638
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.000
this was left for you
at the front desk.

639
00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240
By who?

640
00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.320
They didn't say.

641
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.400
Wh-What, no card?

642
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
No.

643
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.640
Okay, just...
just leave it over there.

644
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920
Thanks.

645
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.680
Good night.

646
00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760
Night.

Just this morning.

660
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.000
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

661
00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.040
I was able to get us on
the 7.00am you like, through Munich.

662
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.000
The connection's short,
but special services are standing by.

663
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.600
Where are things with DG?

664
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.080
Please tell me
they've finally woken up

665
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.800
to see the wisdom of
honest-to-God LPs for this release?

666
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.960
No movement there yet.

667
00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.736
Have you looked
at the email I drafted for you?

668
00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.760
Sent it last night.

669
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.560
Well, just forward me their response.

670
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.880
What's your take
on <i>The New Yorker</i> talk?

671
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.040
It went well, I thought.

672
00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.680
Oh. You're hedging.

673
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.240
I was garrulous.

674
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.320
No.

675
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.800
No, not at all.
You... you were fabulous.

676
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.960
Francesca.

677
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.600
If you have any real interest
in conducting

678
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.360
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

679
00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.160
Okay. Perhaps you...

680
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.680
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

681
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.800
Lenny?

682
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.600
No. I... I was thinking
about Mahler and Alma's.

683
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.560
You implied that she betrayed him.

684
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.040
I'm not... I'm not sure
I agree with that.

685
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.760
Oh, really?

686
00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.360
Alma was a composer, too

687
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.520
but he insisted
she stop writing music.

688
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.856
He said there was only room for...

689
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:28.240
- One asshole in the house?
- One asshole in the house. Yes.

690
00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:32.120
And she agreed to those rules.
No one made that decision for her.

691
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.800
#RulesOfTheGame.

692
00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.440
Okay.

693
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.960
How was your evening?

694
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.600
Yeah, uneventful.

695
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.240
Are there any of Sharon's pills left?

696
00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.600
No, but Dr. Korovin called these in.

697
00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280
Thanks.

698
00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.880
I received another weird email
from Krista.

699
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.800
How should I reply?

700
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400
Don't.

701
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.040
This one felt especially desperate.

702
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.680
Do you have some kind
of profit-sharing deal

703
00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.520
with the utility company
that I am unaware of?

704
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.320
The flutter's back.

705
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.920
It's... It's racing.

706
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.000
I can't find my Metoprolol anywhere.

707
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.360
Oh, fuck.

708
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.520
I found this
lying loose in the drawer.

709
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:52.920
Is this the right one?

710
00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.480
Yeah.

711
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.880
Thank you.

712
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.000
Is that a new bag?

713
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.760
Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

714
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.480
You want it?

715
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560
No.

716
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.120
Suits you.

717
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.320
Let's slow this down
to 60 beats a minute.

718
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.520
Actually, it's 64 beats.

719
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.280
Tried calling you
on your mobile last night.

720
00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.480
And again at the hotel.

721
00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.560
Must've been asleep.

722
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.120
You never sleep that deeply.

723
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.800
No, no, don't be a scold.

724
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.000
<i>Feelin' a feelin'</i>

725
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:18.080
<i>For somethin' there ain't too much of</i>

726
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.040
I'm worried about Petra.

727
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.160
She's starting
to disappear into herself.

728
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.920
Be specific.

729
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.040
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

730
00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.400
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

731
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.800
I mean, I hope
it's just playground football

732
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.800
and not some Biodeutsche thing.

733
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.800
We talked about this.

734
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.320
But maybe we just need to put more
effort into finding her a friend.

735
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.200
Last year was really hard

736
00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.560
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

737
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.200
She's old enough to learn piano.

738
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:10.760
I'll teach her.

739
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840
Yeah.

740
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.200
That might be good.

741
00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.760
How's your heart?

742
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.680
Better now.

743
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.760
Knock, knock. Who's there?

744
00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:51.720
Lenny?

745
00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.200
Walter?

746
00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.920
Oh, it's you, MTT.

747
00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.400
Why do you insist
on holding things up like that?

748
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.240
Your business here is rejoicing

749
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.720
not screaming
like a fucking porn star.

750
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.120
<i>Michael Tilson Thomas...</i>

751
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.000
Hello, Petra.

752
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.400
Why are you lurking?

753
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.000
Tell me and I'll help.

754
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.200
Sharon?

755
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.720
I'm taking Petra to school.

756
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.240
Oh, okay.

757
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:33.880
- Come on.
- <i>Tschüss.</i>

758
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.800
Who'll bear the pall?

759
00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.360
"We," said the wren,
"both the cock and

760
00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.600
- the hen."
- The hen.

761
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.680
"I'll..."

762
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.480
"We'll bear the pall."

763
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.080
And who'll sing a psalm?

764
00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.920
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

765
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.400
"I'll sing a song."

766
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.360
"Who'll toll the bell?"

767
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.800
"I," said the bull,
"because I can pull.

768
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.080
I'll toll the bell."

769
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.640
All the birds of the air

770
00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.600
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

771
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.400
when they heard the bell toll

772
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.480
for poor Cock Robin!

773
00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.640
It's gonna be okay.

774
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.000
All right. Okay, which one is she?

775
00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.560
The red one.

776
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.320
- Bye.
- Go on.

777
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.320
<i>Hallo, Johanna.</i>

778
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:00.680
Hello. Hi.

779
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.720
They're all in the chamber hall?

780
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Yes.

781
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.040
No.

782
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080
Good morning.

783
00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.400
Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

784
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.520
We weren't sure you were coming.

785
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.120
We were told there might be
a scheduling conflict.

786
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.560
Would you like me to take notes?

787
00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.840
No, thank you, Sebastian.

788
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.040
That won't be necessary.

789
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.080
Do we all have our rating sheets?

790
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.360
We narrowed it down to three.

791
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.200
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss

792
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.400
let's bring in number one.

793
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.200
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

794
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:38.000
And of course, Léon was rather famous
for his rather wide vibrato, huh?

795
00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.960
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

796
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:45.680
How's the writing going?

797
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.440
I never know
how to answer that question.

798
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.560
No.

799
00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:55.320
Makes it sound like a physical act.
Like, how's the shitting going?

800
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Okay.

801
00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.920
How's the thinking going?

802
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.520
Yeah, not so well.

803
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.760
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

804
00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:07.800
only to catch myself in pastiche.

805
00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.000
It's all pastiche.

806
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.160
We all have the same musical grammar.

807
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.640
Just look at Beethoven Five.

808
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.200
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

809
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.560
as the opening theme of
the final movement of Mozart Forty.

810
00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.720
Th-that could've been a coincidence.

811
00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.680
No. Not in this case.

812
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.000
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used

813
00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.320
29 bars of Mozart's finale appear.

814
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:36.320
Copied out by Beethoven.

815
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:40.200
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

816
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.040
I finished reading your manuscript.
It's very good, Lydia.

817
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.240
One for the ages.

818
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.320
And, I dare say, will be available

819
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.920
long after my book
has been forgotten.

820
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.200
Oh, yes, you're right.

821
00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.560
The entire first printing
will always be available.

822
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.520
Too modest, as usual.

823
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.760
Thank you, Andris.

824
00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.400
I'll cherish this.

825
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.040
You may use it.

826
00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.000
A... a blurb for the covers.

827
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.680
Oh, thank you.

828
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.800
I'll send it to the publisher.

829
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.480
Hopefully, there's still time.

830
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.960
I'm proud to call you my pupil

831
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.616
even though there was really
nothing I could teach you.

832
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.880
Now, that's not true.

833
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.520
I'd never have the position here
were it not for you.

834
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.360
Then you'd be in London, New York.

835
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.000
They're not Berlin.

836
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.000
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do

837
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.640
were we ever to leave.
She's so close with her family.

838
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.520
Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

839
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.440
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

840
00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:49.680
while she still held sway at DG.

841
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.800
Heike is a woman of many opinions.

842
00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:55.320
And that voice.

843
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.480
I mean, the signal-to-noise ratio,
it's unbearable.

844
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.160
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

845
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.600
to get any writing done.

846
00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.200
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

847
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.360
against his sensitivity to noise.

848
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:11.840
Didn't he once also throw
a woman down a flight of stairs

849
00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:12.960
who later sued him?

850
00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040
Yes.

851
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.400
Although, it's unclear
this private and personal failing

852
00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.200
is at all relevant to his work.

853
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:28.360
You're late.

854
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.256
- Here, give me your stick.
- Thank you.

855
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:33.280
I've got it.

856
00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.560
Okay.

857
00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:19.000
(German)

858
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.000
(German)

859
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.600
Okay?

860
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.480
But it's also...

861
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.560
It's like we're hearing it
from a very, very great distance.

862
00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:32.640
So it's...

863
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:39.920
Sorry. Is Harald nearby?

864
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.880
(German)

865
00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.320
Harald? I was just wondering
if you might

866
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.400
quickly rig something up for us?

867
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.640
Good, good, good.

868
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.240
(German) Harald?

869
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:20.680
(German)

870
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.440
We'll want the same backstage setup
for the live recording.

871
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.200
One, two, one.

872
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:51.520
(German)

873
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.920
Okay? Looks great, but...

874
00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.760
we need to hear it. Okay? It's not...

875
00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280
Hey.

876
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:08.720
(German)

877
00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:10.560
Okay?

878
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:14.280
(German)

879
00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:26.200
No. (German)

880
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.800
It's... it's much too slow.

881
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.680
(German)

882
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.240
(German)

883
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.400
Okay.

884
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.480
Okay, tutti.

885
00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.680
(German)

886
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.240
How are things feeling up here?

887
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.320
- Fine, yeah.
- Yeah, actually great

888
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.640
but it's a shame we don't
record this one direct-to-disk.

889
00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.920
It's criminal, is more like it.

890
00:59:58.480 --> 00:59:59.800
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

891
01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.040
Yeah, sure,
but don't you want WAV files?

892
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.080
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

893
01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.160
What about video?

894
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.080
Yes, yes. Stage left A camera.

895
01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.640
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

896
01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.360
Okay. Bye. You're quite welcome.

897
01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.320
(German)

898
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.000
- There?
- Yeah.

899
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.200
You want us to come...

900
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.856
- to come in stronger there?
- Okay, then yeah.

901
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:21.000
Here, 'cause the reigning dynamic
is forte, which is not good.

902
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

903
01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.600
Just one small thing, Maestro.

904
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.320
During the scherzo

905
01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.400
th-th-the clarinet solo's
still a bit too loud.

906
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.680
It should really be
an accompanying figure

907
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.080
to the first violins.

908
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.000
But apart from that,
I'd say we're in very good shape.

909
01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.120
Thank you, Sebastian.

910
01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.760
Thank you.

911
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.880
Accurate assessment?

912
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:51.800
I don't think so.

913
01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:55.080
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

914
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.120
Sebastian likes to sit in the stalls

915
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.280
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

916
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.680
Something a bit more playful.

917
01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.400
Oh, and here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

918
01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.536
I think it's very powerful.

919
01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.200
Yes, it's... it's really
wonderful work, Karl.

920
01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.120
I'm just wondering if we might try
something a little less considered.

921
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.200
Something simple like this?

922
01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.120
I'm not sure
how you would want to light it.

923
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.520
Have Harald dim
the houselights to half.

924
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.120
Houselights down half, please.

925
01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.640
I mean, we could make it work, but
we'd have to bring in some lights.

926
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.840
If we want to do something like this

927
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.120
we'll have to bring the hot lights
next week, Tanya

928
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.360
forget about the strobes.

929
01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.520
Thank you for waiting.

930
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.800
Of course, Maestro.

931
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.680
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

932
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.200
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

933
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.000
is a bit loud.

934
01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.920
It's possible.

935
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.520
I don't agree.

936
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.000
Your dynamic marking is higher
than that of the first violin.

937
01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.200
Yes, that's true.

938
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.680
Look. Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

939
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.720
I'm rotating him out.

940
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.120
You're the first to know.

941
01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.120
Well...

942
01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.880
then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

943
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.560
No. No, you won't.

944
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.800
A vote must be taken.

945
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.360
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

946
01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.600
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

947
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.600
is entirely my decision.

948
01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.440
Yes.

949
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.680
So, I can count on
your support with the others?

950
01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.160
Yes.

951
01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240
Good.

952
01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.640
Who will you replace him with?

953
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.520
Oh. I'm considering a few names

954
01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.320
but the main thing is
we proceed with this immediately.

955
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.800
I understand.

956
01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.280
Maestro, the other players
would like to know

957
01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.920
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

958
01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.120
Okay. Thanks.

959
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.560
- I...
- It's okay.

960
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920
Thanks.

961
01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.400
<i>Changing major to minor</i>

962
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.520
I'm sorry, I knocked.

963
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.120
I knew you wanted your keys back
as quickly as possible.

964
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.240
Yes, thanks.

965
01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:31.000
- Did you use the company card?
- Yeah.

966
01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.760
We can use it for your...

967
01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.200
your taxi home.

968
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.120
Yeah. It's all right. You can go.

969
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.400
It wasn't just the keys.

970
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.880
I... I need someone to hold me.

971
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:56.200
This isn't the place, Francesca.

972
01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.320
You're... That's not about...

973
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.400
I just...

974
01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.520
I just got this
from someone over at Accordion.

975
01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.680
Oh, no.

976
01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.600
When did this happen?

977
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.320
Day before yesterday.

978
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.400
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

979
01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.520
Delete it. And the rest.

980
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.120
There's no reason
to get caught up in any intrigue.

981
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800
Now, now.

982
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.800
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

983
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.040
She wasn't one of us.

984
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.240
I can't stop thinking
about our trip up the Ucayali.

985
01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.520
- The three of us were so close.
- Yes.

986
01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.240
But that was before
she started making demands.

987
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:22.480
No. There was just something
not quite right about her.

988
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.160
She had so much promise.

989
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.000
She did.

990
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:28.400
Yes.

991
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.880
Almost as much as you.

992
01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.880
Now, we have to forget about her.

993
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.160
You understand?

994
01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.600
Right?

995
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.360
- I'm sorry.
- No.

996
01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.640
I know you're working.

997
01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.120
Your...

998
01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.800
Your keys are on the kitchen table.

999
01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.720
She went straight to sleep.

1000
01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.480
Didn't even have to hold her foot.

1001
01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.120
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1002
01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.680
Oh, attagirl.

1003
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.360
Met the new cellist today.

1004
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.360
Oh, what was that like?

1005
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.680
Olga Metkina.

1006
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200
Russian.

1007
01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.960
Strong player.

1008
01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.760
Good.

1009
01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.560
Her facial posture is a bit much.

1010
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.360
How so?

1011
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.200
Her legato. Looks like
she's on the verge of climaxing.

1012
01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.800
She is young.

1013
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.120
So you've met her.

1014
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.240
No, no.

1015
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.240
Francesca mentioned something.

1016
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.120
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1017
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.800
You may want to hold off on that.

1018
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.800
Her invitation is conditional.

1019
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.080
You have reservations?

1020
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:19.920
No.

1021
01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.920
Not really.

1022
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.880
We need to see if she fits in.

1023
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.680
Did you take your pill?

1024
01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.680
No.

1025
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.800
Thank you for reminding me.

1026
01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.240
How was Johanna yesterday?

1027
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.720
She stays away now.

1028
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.000
Good. You let me know
if that changes.

1029
01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.680
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1030
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.200
No, Lydia.

1031
01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.880
Because you do know you're not
supposed to be in there without me.

1032
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.040
I know.

1033
01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:24.440
That's right.

1034
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.320
It's not so simple.
It's got... it's got to be messier.

1035
01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.640
Moment. It's...

1036
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040
(German)

1037
01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760
Okay?

1038
01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:15.880
(German)

1039
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.200
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1040
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.160
Forget Visconti.

1041
01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.000
Okay? It's so familiar
to everyone here.

1042
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.880
It really doesn't help you
to know this piece so well. Okay.

1043
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.200
Same place.

1044
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.320
Just a little crescendo...

1045
01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.120
now let the third come through.

1046
01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920
Please.

1047
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.480
Please, please, please.

1048
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.080
You must watch.

1049
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.720
It's completely free here.

1050
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680
Okay?

1051
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.600
It's got to be like just one person
singing their heart out.

1052
01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880
And...

1053
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.080
you're playing like an...

1054
01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.480
exercise.

1055
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.280
Okay.

1056
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.640
Once again
from the top of the Adagietto.

1057
01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720
Okay.

1058
01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.200
Maestro.

1059
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.520
What a surprise.
I was just having a spot of lunch.

1060
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.160
C-Can I offer you anything?

1061
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.480
No, thank you.

1062
01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.200
- Well, some tea, perhaps?
- No, thank you, Sebastian.

1063
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:53.320
You know, I forget sometimes just how
impressive your collection is here.

1064
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.120
Is that Kalinnikov?

1065
01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:56.760
Yes.

1066
01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.000
Isn't he marvelous?

1067
01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.640
He belongs in a museum.

1068
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.880
I rescued him for a hundred rubles
from a Kyiv street fair back in '90.

1069
01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.720
Right after the Wall came down.

1070
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.280
That must really have been something.

1071
01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.120
Oh, incredible
to have lived through it.

1072
01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.640
I'd only just arrived here
with Andris

1073
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.600
and suddenly
the impossible was possible.

1074
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.840
Yeah.

1075
01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:25.080
I'd like to talk about that.

1076
01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.000
- The reunification?
- No, no.

1077
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.240
But please, sit down.

1078
01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.880
No, about the possibility of you
fronting a subscription orchestra.

1079
01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.840
But I already do.

1080
01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.000
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1081
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.400
If not now, then when, Sebastian?

1082
01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.680
You mean leave Berlin?

1083
01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.200
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1084
01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.200
But this is my home.

1085
01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.560
Our only home is the podium.

1086
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:59.200
We all live out of a suitcase.
You know that as well as anyone.

1087
01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.680
Just think about it.

1088
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280
Take your time.

1089
01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.040
It's not something
we need to decide now.

1090
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.480
It's the girl, isn't it?

1091
01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.800
I'm sorry, what girl?

1092
01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.200
You're not asking.

1093
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:22.760
You're telling.

1094
01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.720
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1095
01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.880
Andris told me not to worry, but...

1096
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400
I knew.

1097
01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.600
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1098
01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:36.920
Oh, please.

1099
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.920
Just because nobody dares breathe it.
We know the things you do.

1100
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.320
The little favors you grant.

1101
01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:44.880
I'm...

1102
01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.880
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1103
01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:51.840
I mean, you of all people
have the temerity

1104
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.360
- to question my integrity?
- No, no.

1105
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.920
I'm... I'm sorry, Maestro.

1106
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.616
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- No, no, no, it's clear

1107
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.400
you know exactly what you're saying.

1108
01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.736
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me

1109
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.680
then wouldn't you say that staying is
entirely out of the question?

1110
01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.840
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1111
01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:06.920
For what?

1112
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.520
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1113
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:11.680
I'm not a misogynist!

1114
01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.000
Misogamy.

1115
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.240
It's a hatred of marriage.

1116
01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.200
Andris is still very much married.

1117
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:25.200
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1118
01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.000
I just don't like what he's implying.

1119
01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.600
It could lead
to more than Chinese whispers.

1120
01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120
I know.

1121
01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.880
We barely survived Der Spiegel
when you and I came out together.

1122
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.720
But with Francesca,
no one could point their finger.

1123
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.600
It's not like
you two are in a relationship.

1124
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680
Yeah, that's true.

1125
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.280
I just... Turns my stomach to think

1126
01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.520
the old robot will be right
about something.

1127
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.920
He's probably already run to Andris.

1128
01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360
Well

1129
01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.200
is there someone other than Francesca
you feel is more qualified?

1130
01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.600
There are others equal to the task.

1131
01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.120
Maybe wait to decide.

1132
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.160
Where are we at with DG?

1133
01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.320
I spoke to an assistant
in Boyd Muir's office

1134
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.920
who said they weren't sure why
they decided on a digital-only set

1135
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
what the criteria were.

1136
01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.240
But I do know they just did
a full-vinyl pressing for Long Yu.

1137
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.560
Of course they did.

1138
01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.520
The Chinese market's incredible.

1139
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.960
All right. Gloves off.

1140
01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.400
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1141
01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.720
Maybe he needs to be reminded of
his Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.

1142
01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.800
You've got
his contact details, right?

1143
01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.320
I'll send it to you right now.

1144
01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.800
My machine's misbehaving again.

1145
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.440
I've already spoken to IT.

1146
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.160
Just here... let me borrow yours.

1147
01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.440
Thank you.

1148
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.240
Where's the matcha?

1149
01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.640
I wasn't sure where you were.

1150
01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.320
Was working out a kink.

1151
01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.280
The... the matcha's cold.

1152
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.936
- I... I'll get another.
- It's all right. I don't need it.

1153
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.640
Let's just keep working.

1154
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.200
Francesca, you did as I asked

1155
01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.400
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista, correct?

1156
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.520
I'm not sure.

1157
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.800
I'm... I'm not sure.
I'll double-check.

1158
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.400
You know, Sebastian's leaving us

1159
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.320
and I wondered if you might compile
a list of suitable replacements.

1160
01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.920
Of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1161
01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400
Thank you.

1162
01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:06.320
Oh, your... your lunch
with the new cellist.

1163
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680
Oh.

1164
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.680
Meant to have you reschedule that
'til after the orchestra votes.

1165
01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.360
I'll text her now.

1166
01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520
No, wait.

1167
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.040
Might as well see what she's made of.

1168
01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.640
This food.

1169
01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.520
The cucumber salad's very good.

1170
01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.320
It's kind of the only real option
in this place if you're vegetarian.

1171
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:40.680
Do you eat fish?

1172
01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760
Not really.

1173
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:47.520
You know, we can go somewhere else.

1174
01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.680
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1175
01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.800
I mean, it's... it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1176
01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.800
that new members are brought here
to sup with the ghosts of the past.

1177
01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.800
I mean, at some point, everyone
from... from Napoleon to Beethoven

1178
01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.000
tucked in for a meal
at one of these tables.

1179
01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.000
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1180
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.320
I wonder which one.

1181
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.000
Who's that? It's a musician?

1182
01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.000
No. She helped found

1183
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.800
Social Democratic
women's movement in Germany

1184
01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.960
and KPD until Hitler came to power

1185
01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.000
and she was exiled to Soviet Union.

1186
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.720
- Clara Zetkin?
- Yes.

1187
01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.360
Every March 8th

1188
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.800
we place flowers at her plaque
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1189
01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320
Her birthday?

1190
01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.400
No, International Women's Day.

1191
01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:37.320
Are you ready, Maestro?

1192
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.400
- Yes...
- Yes, first shashlik, then veal.

1193
01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:44.680
For you?

1194
01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.360
- Cucumber salad. Thank you.
- Good choice.

1195
01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:51.520
Some more bread?

1196
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.920
It's good. Would you like a bite?

1197
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Oh, no.

1198
01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.760
No. Thank you.

1199
01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.120
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1200
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.680
No, not at all.

1201
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:12.560
I have friends in Wicker I visit
until I know decision of orchestra.

1202
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.480
Simonov will hold your place?

1203
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.960
Yes, I think so. He is my uncle.

1204
01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.720
Oh.

1205
01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.640
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1206
01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.800
Oh, me, too.

1207
01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:27.400
There's nowhere like it.

1208
01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.200
I imagine Rostropovich is
a hero of yours.

1209
01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.520
Well, of course, he was great.

1210
01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.040
We study him at Moscow Conservatory

1211
01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:44.000
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1212
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.920
She made me want to play cello.

1213
01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.200
Which record was it?

1214
01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.120
Not record. YouTube.

1215
01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.920
Elgar Concerto.

1216
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.320
Oh, of course.

1217
01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:57.360
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1218
01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.000
I don't know who was conducting.

1219
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.000
But she did something to me.

1220
01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.000
That's when I decide to learn piece
and play it with youth orchestra.

1221
01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.640
Quite a challenge. How old were you?

1222
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720
Thirteen.

1223
01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:13.720
Wow.

1224
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.680
I'd love to hear it.

1225
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.400
They make video. I will text to you.

1226
01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:20.480
Beautiful.

1227
01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.280
Very nice indeed.

1228
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.200
Let's leave it here.

1229
01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.480
Tomorrow we'll begin
with the Rondo-Finale.

1230
01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.320
Now, just before we break

1231
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:38.320
I know many of you are wondering
what the companion piece will be.

1232
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.320
And I have been thinking
quite a bit about it

1233
01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.600
and was wondering
if we could just take

1234
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:45.800
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1235
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.520
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1236
01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.320
Wonderful.

1237
01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:12.600
Elgar it is.

1238
01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:17.440
Oh, and... given what
we've all been through

1239
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.600
what we're still going through

1240
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.880
and we're finally back together
as a family, I... I...

1241
01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.960
I feel that maybe the soloist should
come from within our own ranks.

1242
01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520
Yeah.

1243
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.400
Good.

1244
01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.880
Okay, good. Just... Sorry.

1245
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.720
One more question.

1246
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.720
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1247
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I mean...

1248
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.920
as a practical matter, I mean,
this would normally fall to you.

1249
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.720
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler

1250
01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.560
I... I wondered
if you'd be at all bothered

1251
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.600
if we were to hold auditions?

1252
01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:03.480
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1253
01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.320
But, in theory, I have no objection.

1254
01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:11.200
My only hesitation will depend

1255
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.776
on when these auditions
might take place.

1256
01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.680
I wouldn't want them in any way
to interfere with our sectionals.

1257
01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.160
No, no. That's a good point.

1258
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.600
I mean, it's gonna have to be a...

1259
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.400
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1260
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.440
How about Monday?

1261
01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.840
All right.

1262
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.880
Okay, good. Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1263
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.720
Let me see what she says.

1264
01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.960
Okay, I got... I gotta go.

1265
01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:58.760
Britta, hi.

1266
01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040
Lydia.

1267
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.760
Just caught the end.

1268
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.896
What'd you think?
How's it... how's it sounding?

1269
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.400
Oh, it's fantastic.

1270
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:08.320
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1271
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.680
Yes, well.

1272
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:11.920
I'll be happy when it's over.

1273
01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.400
It's always that way.

1274
01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.880
I know you're busy,
and I don't want to add to your load

1275
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.160
but...

1276
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.800
Andris Davis called.

1277
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.640
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1278
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.720
No... no.

1279
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:26.960
Something else.

1280
01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.256
But you will please let Laura know

1281
01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:29.696
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1282
01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:30.976
so she can prepare a press release.

1283
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.200
Yeah, of course.

1284
01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:34.120
So what did he want?

1285
01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.480
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1286
01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.880
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1287
01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.200
Do you know anything about this?

1288
01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.480
Yes.

1289
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.120
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1290
01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:47.640
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1291
01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.120
Because he needs to believe that.

1292
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.520
H-He needs to b...

1293
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.120
needs to believe
he hasn't been forgotten, Britta.

1294
01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.320
The academy
has von Karajan's name on it

1295
01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:00.760
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1296
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:04.920
But the name of Davis,
it's essentially nowhere to be seen.

1297
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
All right.

1298
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:09.520
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1299
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Of course.

1300
01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.520
One other thing.

1301
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.200
It's unpleasant.

1302
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.080
Oh, is it?

1303
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.640
Operational shortfall?

1304
01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.520
Must I take Mrs. Sewing out
to drinks again?

1305
01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.440
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1306
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:25.680
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1307
01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.320
named Krista Taylor?

1308
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:32.960
Yes. Why?

1309
01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:35.000
Apparently, she committed suicide.

1310
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:37.640
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1311
01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.920
Her parents mu...

1312
01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.800
Wait, sorry, I'm...

1313
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560
I'm confused, Britta.

1314
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.400
Why... why were you put
in the position

1315
01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:47.720
to deliver this terrible news?

1316
01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.720
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1317
01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.480
It's delicate, Lydia.

1318
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:53.096
Mr. Kaplan thought it might be best

1319
01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.320
if you contacted a lawyer before
speaking with anyone at Accordion.

1320
01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.000
Well, presumably, that
anyone includes Eliot himself.

1321
01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.320
I'm... I'm sorry, why... why
would I need to do that?

1322
01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.000
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1323
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.280
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1324
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.400
He didn't say.

1325
01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.720
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1326
01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:19.760
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it

1327
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.800
but one can't be too careful.

1328
01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.480
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1329
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.720
I need to speak
to Mr. Singer immediately.

1330
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:46.720
Yes.

1331
01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.120
Yes, it's urgent.

1332
01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.840
Tired?

1333
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.520
Sleep's elusive.

1334
01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.920
I was the same
before a recording date.

1335
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.880
Lydia...

1336
01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.800
are... are you absolutely certain
about Sebastian?

1337
01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.000
Who will you replace him with?

1338
01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.920
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1339
01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.120
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1340
01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.760
Not the girl?

1341
01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:57.840
Andris...

1342
01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:07.320
have you ever had an issue
with a... a student or colleague

1343
01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.440
where that person may
have misinterpreted your...

1344
01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:10.576
- intention?
- Has someone been complaining

1345
01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.656
- about me?
- No, no, no, of course not.

1346
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.576
Because at this point,
they've missed their chance.

1347
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.800
- I'm out of the game.
- Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1348
01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:16.880
Course you are.

1349
01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.320
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium like Jimmy Levine.

1350
01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.040
Or hunted like Charles Dutoit.

1351
01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.920
I take it you're asking for a reason.

1352
01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.360
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1353
01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.520
in the news lately.

1354
01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.520
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1355
01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.880
But I suppose that was also the case
all those years ago with Furtwängler.

1356
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:42.400
A bit with Karajan, too.

1357
01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.680
Who was the better conductor?

1358
01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.120
I never played under Furtwängler.

1359
01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.800
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members had...

1360
01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.400
hushed opinions.

1361
01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:01.000
At the same time,
they wanted to leave that era behind.

1362
01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:03.000
- What, the war?
- No, postwar.

1363
01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.000
Denazification.

1364
01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:09.400
Someone pointed a finger at you,
process started all over again.

1365
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.800
Furtwängler never joined the Party.

1366
01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:15.040
Refused to give the salute or
to conduct the <i>Horst Wessel Lied.</i>

1367
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.720
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1368
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.400
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1369
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.000
But he was obliged to be denazified.

1370
01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.320
Until then, he was semi-retired

1371
01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.880
playing corpses.

1372
01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.880
Playing corpses?

1373
01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:35.840
Secretly performing in a graveyard.

1374
01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:40.400
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1375
01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.000
with being an accused Nazi?

1376
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:44.720
Either way, you had to be ready.

1377
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.120
For years, I made sure

1378
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.320
all the hangers in my closet
were facing the same direction.

1379
01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.400
How many are auditioning on Monday?

1380
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.920
No one.

1381
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.800
No one?

1382
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.200
Maybe Martin.

1383
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.480
He's never gotten along with Gosia.

1384
01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.680
He would love
to sit downstage for once.

1385
01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.200
Well...

1386
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.400
he's still gonna have to audition.

1387
01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920
Of course.

1388
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.360
Have to follow the rules.

1389
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.240
Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1390
01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.640
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1391
01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:39.520
No, Maestro, there are two.

1392
01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:41.480
Well, it's unanimous.

1393
01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.800
Number two.

1394
01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.680
And we have a problem.

1395
01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.960
She's not officially been invited
to become a member of the orchestra.

1396
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.040
Well, she wouldn't need
to be to solo for us.

1397
01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.920
I believe the criteria
of the audition

1398
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.160
was all section members?

1399
01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.800
- Then her audition gets thrown out.
- No.

1400
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.000
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1401
01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.200
so we can give him the news.

1402
01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.200
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1403
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:10.800
Shit!

1404
01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:14.160
Yeah!

1405
01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.760
I'll confirm
solo rehearsal dates with her.

1406
01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.080
Thank you.

1407
01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:23.120
Have a seat.

1408
01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:32.320
I have made a decision
regarding Sebastian's replacement.

1409
01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.120
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1410
01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:43.440
This position brings with it
enormous responsibility

1411
01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.000
and my personal affection
for you aside...

1412
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.480
I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1413
01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.880
Oh, leave me alone.

1414
01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.840
I don't have your paper.

1415
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.200
I've told you before, I...

1416
01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1417
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.120
Good. Good.

1418
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.800
I... I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1419
01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.920
Don't you think?

1420
01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.000
How do you take your coffee?

1421
01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.760
Black. Strong.

1422
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.720
Is all right if I play?

1423
01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.560
Oh, yes, of course, of course.

1424
01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.000
That's as far as I've gotten.

1425
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.120
But it's good.

1426
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:49.920
This part here.

1427
01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.240
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1428
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.680
That's better. I like that sound.

1429
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.880
Come on. Take a break.

1430
01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:06.960
Okay.

1431
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.480
Sharon?

1432
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.880
Hello.

1433
01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:42.800
Petra.

1434
01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:09.560
What are you doing in here?

1435
01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.920
I'm hiding from her.

1436
01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.080
Why?

1437
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.520
Because she told me
to put my things in order

1438
01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.520
but they already are.

1439
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.200
I can see that.

1440
01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:26.560
Come on.

1441
01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.520
They're all waiting for you.

1442
01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:32.080
I'm going to give everyone a pencil.

1443
01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.880
All of them?
They can't all conduct, honey.

1444
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.800
It's not a... it's not a democracy.

1445
01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.760
Okay.

1446
01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:46.720
Very nice. We'll go back
to the Allegro Molto after the break.

1447
01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.640
(German)

1448
01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.600
Hey, that's good. You happy?

1449
01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.640
How long were you
acquainted with Miss Taylor?

1450
01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:02.960
Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant

1451
01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.760
but cumulatively speaking, I'd say
not more than a few months.

1452
01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.160
Thank you for your time

1453
01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.320
- Maestro.
- Not at all.

1454
01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:13.880
This recording will exist
on a protected server

1455
01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:16.240
under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1456
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.656
- Great.
- He will follow up with you

1457
01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.200
to help prepare for the deposition.

1458
01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:23.960
Deposition?

1459
01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.040
Yes.

1460
01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.520
I assumed you were aware.

1461
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:31.280
Mr. Singer's office said they'd been
coordinating with your assistant.

1462
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.320
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1463
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:35.440
right now.

1464
01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.520
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1465
01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.736
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1466
01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:43.280
tendering her immediate resignation

1467
01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:46.600
stating she would be in contact
when she had more details to provide.

1468
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.840
What kind of details?

1469
01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.520
A new address, I suppose.

1470
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.520
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1471
01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.040
to find someone suitable
to assist you on a temporary basis.

1472
01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:58.320
For now, perhaps your new assistant
conductor would be the right fit.

1473
01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.800
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1474
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.440
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1475
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.640
I know how much you depended on her.

1476
01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.120
Two-faced little bitch.

1477
01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:11.480
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1478
01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:13.640
- Don't you dare try to defend her.
- God, slow down!

1479
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.880
She'll come galumphing back.
I mean, I've got a dumb phone

1480
01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:18.176
- like every robot. How hard
- Tár, s...

1481
01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:19.600
can it be to text all day?

1482
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.080
Slow down!

1483
01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:23.360
Or let me out!

1484
01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:45.120
Francesca!

1485
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.320
Fräulein?

1486
01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.200
(German)

1487
01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:09.080
Come.

1488
01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.520
(German)

1489
01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.520
Sorry I'm late again.

1490
01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.280
Do you live here?

1491
01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.000
Not normally, no.

1492
01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.936
Make yourself at home.
I'm just gonna put something on.

1493
01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.000
Do you have a towel?

1494
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.760
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1495
01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:10.000
I got caught in the rain.

1496
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.120
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1497
01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.240
You should come.

1498
01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:29.680
Thanks, but I...
really must get home.

1499
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.360
You have child, yes?

1500
01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.000
I will not do that.

1501
01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.440
Pets are better for some people.

1502
01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:51.920
What... Oh.

1503
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:53.520
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1504
01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.720
Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1505
01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:55.840
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

1506
01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:57.680
- Oh.
- Okay.

1507
01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.480
Oh, Olga!

1508
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.240
Olga!

1509
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Olga?

1510
01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.320
Olga?

1511
01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.240
Hello?

1512
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.280
Olga?

1513
01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.880
Olga?

1514
01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.200
Olga?

1515
01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.800
Why didn't you go to the police?

1516
01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:26.520
I fought. He ran. What's to tell?

1517
01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.640
Oh, God. I'm gonna get you
something for the pain.

1518
01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.200
- No, I don't need anything.
- No, I'm gonna get you something.

1519
01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.520
<i>Ja.</i>

1520
01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:00.000
Lydia!

1521
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.760
Lydia!

1522
01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:10.560
What is it?

1523
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:14.920
Hold my foot.

1524
01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.200
Is that better?

1525
01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:25.760
Yes.

1526
01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:06.800
Okay.

1527
01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.800
Let's shoo the elephant
from the room.

1528
01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:12.920
"What the hell happened to her face?"

1529
01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.480
"Did she schedule a nose and eye job

1530
01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:18.720
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1531
01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:25.200
No.

1532
01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:27.480
I was... I was attacked.

1533
01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:29.160
Thank you.

1534
01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:31.400
I'm fine. Really.

1535
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.080
Should've seen the other guy.

1536
01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.440
All right.

1537
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:39.720
Second movement, let's take
the transition Bar 406.

1538
01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.000
Don't. It burns.

1539
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.520
You must see the doctor.

1540
01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.760
He's booked 'til next week.

1541
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:26.616
I'll call them again and tell them

1542
01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.176
- how much pain you're in.
- No, no, let's just...

1543
01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.320
let's just finish up here.

1544
01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320
Okay?

1545
01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:33.680
Overall, the balance feels right.

1546
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.040
Other than a quick brush-up,
we should concentrate on the Elgar.

1547
01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.360
You're certain of that?

1548
01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.880
I think so. Yes.

1549
01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.280
We're absolutely rock-solid there

1550
01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.720
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1551
01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:52.680
They're just getting caught up in
the power of your glissando in there

1552
01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:53.760
trying to match it.

1553
01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.000
Probably...

1554
01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.600
Where were you attacked, Maestro?

1555
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.000
Oh, doesn't matter.

1556
01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:04.640
Here.

1557
01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:06.600
Thank you.

1558
01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.520
There you are.

1559
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.920
When did this fall happen?

1560
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.520
It's all a blur.
Three, four days ago.

1561
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.920
It's just my shoulder.

1562
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.400
Yeah. It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

1563
01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:23.520
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

1564
01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:25.280
You've damaged some nerves.

1565
01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:28.080
The burning sensation you're feeling
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1566
01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.280
Nostalgia?

1567
01:56:29.480 --> 01:56:31.240
"Notalgia." No "S."

1568
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.080
Well, how do we treat it?

1569
01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.320
You don't. Eventually, it goes away.

1570
01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.600
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1571
01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:26.920
<i>Oh, well, then you must be</i>

1572
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.800
<i>a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.</i>

1573
01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:34.520
<i>Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there</i>

1574
01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.720
<i>to a superhot young woman.</i>

1575
01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:39.480
<i>That's... that's...
that was very good.</i>

1576
01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.720
<i>Now, you could masturbate</i>

1577
01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.320
<i>but what are you
actually doing to me?</i>

1578
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.080
- Britta.
- <i>Hi, hi.</i>

1579
01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:53.160
<i>Have you seen it?</i>

1580
01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.920
Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1581
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.560
<i>It's gathering this afternoon.</i>

1582
01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.920
- This afternoon?
- <i>Is that a problem?</i>

1583
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:01.520
No, just... No, it's no problem.

1584
01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:39.080
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

1585
01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:43.200
And second,
whoever violated that rule

1586
01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.040
edited what we've all seen

1587
01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:48.160
to create linguistic traps
to completely redefine my words.

1588
01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.176
I mean, look at
the reverse shots on the students.

1589
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:53.000
There's no way that was done
in real time. It's a hatchet job.

1590
01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.040
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1591
01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:58.400
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

1592
01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:00.840
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article

1593
01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.240
in the <i>New York Post</i>
regarding Krista Taylor's suicide

1594
01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:05.600
which alludes
to other Accordion fellows

1595
01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:07.520
they claim to have interviewed.

1596
01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:09.880
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

1597
01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.000
We haven't had any.

1598
01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:12.480
Obviously, we gave no response

1599
01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.720
as we first wanted to meet
to discuss strategy.

1600
01:59:15.320 --> 01:59:17.000
- Here's the article.
- Thank you, Laura.

1601
01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:25.000
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

1602
01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:27.800
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

1603
01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:30.360
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

1604
01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.040
This is total fiction.

1605
01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:35.160
And the <i>Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

1606
01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:37.520
No serious person reads it.

1607
01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:43.080
And so far as Krista Taylor goes

1608
01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:47.000
she was disturbed.
I mean, she fixated on me.

1609
01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:48.600
In what way?

1610
01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:52.320
She sent me weird gifts.
She trolled me online.

1611
01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.480
She tried to send me signals.

1612
01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:55.616
Well, what kind of signals?

1613
01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.360
She vandalized my Wikipedia page
to say she was my muse.

1614
01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.200
I mean, that's easily checked, right?

1615
02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:03.720
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

1616
02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.520
No.

1617
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.760
No. And I... Look, I probably...
I probably should have.

1618
02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:11.800
I... I felt sorry for her.

1619
02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.856
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

1620
02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:15.560
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

1621
02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.640
- Don't you think you should have?
- Yes. Yes.

1622
02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.320
Well, what... what do you advise?

1623
02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.760
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

1624
02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:24.160
None of the trades have linked to it
or called for comment.

1625
02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:25.840
So I say let's see what happens.

1626
02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:30.200
We wanted to give you
as much warning as possible, Lydia

1627
02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.120
before this Friday's donor meeting.

1628
02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:34.800
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

1629
02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:37.000
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

1630
02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:41.200
I have the book launch in New York
and apparently a deposition.

1631
02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:45.400
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

1632
02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:49.640
Enjoy your weekend.

1633
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.200
Starving.

1634
02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:55.520
Finished my thing today.

1635
02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.520
Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

1636
02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.920
I can't. I gotta pack.

1637
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:01.520
Hi!

1638
02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.440
Sharon?

1639
02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:10.320
Yeah?

1640
02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.000
You seen my performance score?

1641
02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:14.320
No.

1642
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.696
Why? Isn't it with the other ones?

1643
02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:16.720
No. No, it's not.

1644
02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.520
Are you sure it's not in my office?

1645
02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:24.600
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

1646
02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.360
Yeah, can you check again, please?

1647
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.360
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

1648
02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:51.480
Lydia?

1649
02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:55.920
Yes?

1650
02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:57.800
When will you be back?

1651
02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.400
The day after tomorrow.

1652
02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.880
Will you promise?

1653
02:02:03.080 --> 02:02:04.560
Yes, I promise.

1654
02:02:15.160 --> 02:02:17.000
- Good night.
- Good night.

1655
02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:33.280
Thanks. Do you have any bottles?

1656
02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.360
Of course.

1657
02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:38.080
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

1658
02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:40.480
Yes. We're waiting on one more.

1659
02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.520
To all my questions

1660
02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.680
pertaining to your communications
with Krista Taylor and others

1661
02:02:53.560 --> 02:02:55.200
your answers have always been

1662
02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:56.560
"I don't know"

1663
02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:59.560
or "I don't remember."

1664
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:03.616
Is there anything I could show you

1665
02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:05.400
that might help refresh
your recollection?

1666
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.320
Any documents, such as

1667
02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:11.520
emails from you or
your personal assistant, Miss Lentini

1668
02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:14.800
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

1669
02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.600
I guess you heard by now.

1670
02:03:24.960 --> 02:03:27.080
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

1671
02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.000
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

1672
02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.576
I'm sorry to say this is likely
the last time we'll see each other.

1673
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.800
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

1674
02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.400
And you can bother someone else

1675
02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.120
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

1676
02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.040
Is there a back entrance?

1677
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:08.800
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music

1678
02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:15.040
"are based on the idea that music
is a language, albeit a secret one.

1679
02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:20.120
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

1680
02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:25.800
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing

1681
02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.200
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

1682
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:35.000
"yet something born
by the mere act of moving air.

1683
02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:39.720
No different than birdsong."

1684
02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:50.720
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

1685
02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.640
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

1686
02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.920
Yeah, me, too. I'll...

1687
02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:57.120
probably do the same.

1688
02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:55.000
Yes, hello.

1689
02:05:55.480 --> 02:05:57.120
Yes, there's no water in my room.

1690
02:05:58.200 --> 02:05:59.400
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

1691
02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.280
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

1692
02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:04.240
Don't worry. I'll just come down.

1693
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.360
Lobby, please.

1694
02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:37.520
Oh, Jesus.

1695
02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:51.480
It was Britta.

1696
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.120
Right?

1697
02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:56.400
I mean, that is how you heard

1698
02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:59.480
about these millennial robots
trading in lies.

1699
02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:02.120
I couldn't care less
about the Juilliard thing.

1700
02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.680
Too much time on her hands.

1701
02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:05.200
She's fringe.

1702
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:06.440
The worst kind.

1703
02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:09.680
Every time I walk out of this house

1704
02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:13.400
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

1705
02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:16.680
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

1706
02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:19.600
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

1707
02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:22.880
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

1708
02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:25.360
I feel sorry for you.

1709
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.520
Save it.

1710
02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:29.880
I tried calling you last night.

1711
02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.720
Did you have fun with her?

1712
02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.480
My back is killing me.

1713
02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:41.760
Francesca left, and I simply needed
someone to carry my bags.

1714
02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.520
I mean, who was I supposed to ask?

1715
02:07:43.760 --> 02:07:45.400
To go with me? Knut?

1716
02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:47.920
Jesus fucking...

1717
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.320
There are many things
I accept about you.

1718
02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:54.520
And in the end, I'm sure I could
get over something like this.

1719
02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:57.720
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

1720
02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:02.000
These accusations

1721
02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.880
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

1722
02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:12.120
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

1723
02:08:16.480 --> 02:08:17.720
They're lies.

1724
02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:23.600
Do you understand what it was like
to walk into my sectional yesterday

1725
02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:26.320
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

1726
02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:30.360
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

1727
02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.720
It's a simple matter

1728
02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:35.880
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

1729
02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:38.480
And what good would that have done?

1730
02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:41.480
I mean, what could you possibly do
to make things better?

1731
02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:45.720
Because I deserve that.

1732
02:08:46.680 --> 02:08:48.200
Those are the rules.

1733
02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:51.960
You are to ask for my fucking counsel

1734
02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:53.720
the way you always have.

1735
02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.016
The way you did
when you first arrived here

1736
02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:58.600
as a guest conductor
looking for a permanent position.

1737
02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:00.800
You asked me what were the politics

1738
02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.520
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

1739
02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.400
Of course...

1740
02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.680
these conversations
took place in another bed.

1741
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:15.760
Or rather, the couch
of that horrible place

1742
02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:18.600
- you still can't let go of.
- Old sorrow blows in.

1743
02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:24.320
How cruel of you to define
our relationship as transactional.

1744
02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:31.120
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

1745
02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.120
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

1746
02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:37.320
Apparently, this hasn't
even crossed your mind.

1747
02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:46.080
Petra!

1748
02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:50.520
Come here, darling.

1749
02:11:53.520 --> 02:11:54.800
- It was good.
- Was it?

1750
02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.320
- Yeah.
- You want to go to the park?

1751
02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:59.400
Don't do this. Please don't do this.

1752
02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:00.920
Please don't.

1753
02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:29.000
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

1754
02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:31.320
This is my late mother's apartment.

1755
02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:35.920
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

1756
02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.280
Thank you.

1757
02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:40.000
How's your sister doing?

1758
02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.120
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

1759
02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.400
I'm sorry to trouble you

1760
02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:48.360
but my husband and I
are selling the place

1761
02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:51.720
and couldn't help hearing the music.

1762
02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:53.560
Oh.

1763
02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:55.200
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1764
02:12:55.680 --> 02:12:58.840
We were wondering if there are
specific hours you rehearse

1765
02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.000
so we can schedule
showings around them.

1766
02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:05.200
We don't want
to scare potential buyers off

1767
02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:06.800
with all the noise.

1768
02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:09.680
Oh, no.

1769
02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.160
No.

1770
02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.040
No, we wouldn't want that.

1771
02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:30.960

1772
02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.000
<i>Apartment for sale</i>

1773
02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:36.680
<i>Your mother's buried deep</i>

1774
02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:38.960
<i>And now you're gonna keep</i>

<i>Her apartment for sale</i>

1776
02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:44.080
<i>Your sister's in jail</i>

1777
02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:47.160
<i>You put your sister in jail</i>

1778
02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:49.360
<i>You're all going to hell</i>

1779
02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:52.280
<i>Your apartment's for sale</i>

1780
02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:43.880
Okay.

1781
02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.960
(German)

1782
02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:46.440
Give me some eyes.

1783
02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:52.400
Come on, give me some eyes!

1784
02:15:57.440 --> 02:15:58.440
Lydia.

1785
02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.240
This is my score.

1786
02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.360
Lydia, you're confused.

1787
02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.800
It's my score!

1788
02:16:05.880 --> 02:16:09.400
You fucking little nothing!

1789
02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.640
I'm fine.

1790
02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:48.200
You sign CAMI voucher.

1791
02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:17.960
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich
in our booking department

1792
02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:19.200
would be a great fit for you

1793
02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:21.200
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

1794
02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:24.920
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

1795
02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:26.360
Jake, you want to...

1796
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:28.880
you want to show Lydia
what you've prepared for her?

1797
02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.000
Well...

1798
02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:33.200
right now it's a reset.

1799
02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.200
What we're after is less, not more.

1800
02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:38.520
We want to be selective
and rebuild this from the ground up.

1801
02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:40.200
That means we need a new story.

1802
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:45.720
Just here.

1803
02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:47.560
Here. Thank you.

1804
02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.720
Make it 40.

1805
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Thank you.

1806
02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:23.000
<i>Didn't you feel triumphant?</i>

1807
02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:30.200
<i>Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.</i>

1808
02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:34.000
<i>It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.</i>

1809
02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:37.000
<i>Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.</i>

1810
02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:39.720
<i>And we're there.
We know what music means now.</i>

1811
02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:42.240
<i>And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps</i>

1812
02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:45.000
<i>and flats and chords
and all that business</i>

1813
02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:48.920
<i>in order to understand music
if it tells us something.</i>

1814
02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:53.080
<i>And the most wonderful thing of all
is that there's no limit</i>

1815
02:19:53.160 --> 02:19:56.640
<i>to the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.</i>

1816
02:19:57.200 --> 02:20:00.760
<i>And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep</i>

1817
02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:03.120
<i>that they can't even
be described in words.</i>

1818
02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:05.680
<i>You see, we can't always name
the things we feel.</i>

1819
02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:08.240
<i>Sometimes we can.
We can say we feel joy</i>

1820
02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:11.400
<i>pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.</i>

1821
02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.040
<i>But every once in a while</i>

1822
02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.920
<i>we have feelings that are
so deep and so special</i>

1823
02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:18.480
<i>that we have no words for them.</i>

1824
02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.360
<i>And that's where
music is so marvelous</i>

1825
02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:26.280
<i>because music names them for us,
only in notes instead of in words.</i>

1826
02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:28.080
<i>It's all in the way music moves.</i>

1827
02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:30.600
<i>You must never forget
that music is movement</i>

1828
02:20:30.680 --> 02:20:33.320
<i>always going somewhere,
shifting and changing</i>

1829
02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.600
<i>and flowing from one note to another.</i>

1830
02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:38.000
<i>And that movement can tell us</i>

1831
02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:41.200
<i>more about the way we feel
than a million words can.</i>

1832
02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:43.240
<i>And here we're going to play you a...</i>

1833
02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.120
Tony.

1834
02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:00.760
Oh.

1835
02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.400
Hi, Linda.

1836
02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:03.640
Sorry.

1837
02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:04.840
Lydia.

1838
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.520
Ma said you'd be over.

1839
02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:09.760
You must be hiding out.

1840
02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:12.880
Why would I be hiding out?

1841
02:21:13.880 --> 02:21:15.200
Beats the hell out of me.

1842
02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:17.560
None of my business anyhow.

1843
02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:21.160
Lot of loose ends, you got to admit.

1844
02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:24.200
What do you mean?

1845
02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.480
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

1846
02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.056
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

1847
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:31.120
or where you're going.

1848
02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:23.000
May I come inside?

1849
02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Thank you.

1850
02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:39.480
I'm so sorry.

1851
02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:42.120
We just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

1852
02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:44.560
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

1853
02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:48.760
I... I must tell you that
I... I looked in the music libraries

1854
02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:51.880
for her score,
but I... I couldn't find anything.

1855
02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:53.480
This just arrived.

1856
02:22:54.400 --> 02:22:55.640
That's great. Thank you.

1857
02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:00.760
Shirley and Cirio will be most happy
to show you the sights

1858
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.016
- of our beautiful country.
- Thank you.

1859
02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:03.240
Thank you so much.

1860
02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.040
Oh, goodness.

1861
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.120
Thank... thank you.

1862
02:23:37.680 --> 02:23:40.520
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

1863
02:23:41.520 --> 02:23:43.120
Yeah, at the waterfall.

1864
02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:45.120
But not in the river.

1865
02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:47.240
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

1866
02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:49.640
No. There are crocodiles.

1867
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.160
Oh.

1868
02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:54.200
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

1869
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.920
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

1870
02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.480
Wow.

1871
02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:00.880
That was a long time ago.

1872
02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:03.000
They survive.

1873
02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.360
Lady. Lady.

1874
02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:42.200
Here is prescription.

1875
02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.800
- Ten dollars.
- Oh. Thank you.

1876
02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:48.960
Is there somewhere
around here... Thank you.

1877
02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:50.720
Where I could get a massage?

1878
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:54.040
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

1879
02:24:57.600 --> 02:24:58.640
Yes.

1880
02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:00.880
There is the very nice place I know.

1881
02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:02.400
Thank you.

1882
02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:16.760
Thank you.

1883
02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:18.360
Please step over to the fishbowl.

1884
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:20.200
The... the fishbowl?

1885
02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.560
Yes, over there.

1886
02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:30.600
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
H-How does this... how does it work?

1887
02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:33.200
You just pick a number here.

1888
02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:37.080
I pick a number?

1889
02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:38.160
Yes.

1890
02:25:49.760 --> 02:25:50.880
Number five?

1891
02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.160
Good morning.

1892
02:26:34.440 --> 02:26:35.640
Good morning.

1893
02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:38.360
Now, before we begin,
let's... let's talk a bit

1894
02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:41.800
about the composer's intent
with this piece.

1895
02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.680
And what she might be after.

1896
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:04.600
Five minutes.

1897
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.600
Thank you.

1898
02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:04.000
<i>Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.</i>

1899
02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:06.520
<i>I'll keep my farewell brief.</i>

1900
02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:08.400
<i>Never was much with words.</i>

1901
02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:12.600
<i>Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.</i>

1902
02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.320
<i>The next ground your feet touch

1903
02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.640
<i>If any of you have lost your nerve</i>

1904
02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:25.320
<i>then step away now
and let no one judge you.</i>
