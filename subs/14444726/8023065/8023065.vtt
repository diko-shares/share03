1
00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:20.184
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.417
<i>No, just... Yeah, just-just
ignore the microphone.</i>

3
00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.425
<i>Yeah, just-just act
as if it's not there.</i>

4
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.126
<i>Sing as if it's not there.</i>

5
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:31.831
<i>Yeah, uh...</i>

6
00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.400
<i>Okay?</i>

7
00:05:44.984 --> 00:05:46.947
- Ready for them?
- Yes.

8
00:05:47.082 --> 00:05:48.223
Let's go.

9
00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:58.133
<i>If you're here, then
you already know</i>

10
00:05:58.268 --> 00:06:00.569
<i>who she is, and that is
one of the most important</i>

11
00:06:00.704 --> 00:06:02.966
<i>musical figures of our time.</i>

12
00:06:03.102 --> 00:06:05.030
<i>Lydia Tár is many things:</i>

13
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:08.467
<i>a piano performance
graduate at the Curtis Institute,</i>

14
00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:10.972
<i>Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.</i>

15
00:06:11.107 --> 00:06:15.147
<i>She got her PhD in Musicology
from the University of Vienna,</i>

16
00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:17.744
<i>specializing in the
indigenous music</i>

17
00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.720
<i>of the Ucayali Valley
in Eastern Peru,</i>

18
00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:22.756
<i>where she spent five years</i>

19
00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:24.750
<i>among the Shipibo-Konibo peopl.</i>

20
00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:28.388
<i>As a conductor,
Tár began her career</i>

21
00:06:28.523 --> 00:06:29.755
<i>with the Cleveland Orchestra,</i>

22
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.362
<i>one of the so-called "Big Five."</i>

23
00:06:31.497 --> 00:06:33.661
<i>A string of important
posts followed,</i>

24
00:06:33.796 --> 00:06:36.164
<i>including the
Philadelphia Orchestra,</i>

25
00:06:36.299 --> 00:06:37.539
<i>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,</i>

26
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:38.904
<i>the Boston Symphony Orchestra,</i>

27
00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:40.776
<i>until she at last arrived here</i>

28
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:43.876
<i>at our own New
York Philharmonic.</i>

29
00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:45.343
<i>With the latter, she organized</i>

30
00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:47.950
<i>the Highway 10 refugee
concerts in Zaatari,</i>

31
00:06:48.085 --> 00:06:52.349
<i>which were attended
by over 75,000 people.</i>

32
00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.021
<i>She's become
particularly well-known</i>

33
00:06:54.157 --> 00:06:55.849
<i>for commissioning
contemporary work</i>

34
00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:59.059
<i>from, among others, Jennifer
Higdon, Caroline Shaw,</i>

35
00:06:59.194 --> 00:07:01.525
<i>Julia Wolfe and
Hildur Gudnadóttir.</i>

36
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.691
<i>And she's made a point
of programming their works</i>

37
00:07:04.826 --> 00:07:07.768
<i>alongside composers
of the canon.</i>

38
00:07:07.903 --> 00:07:09.202
<i>She's been quoted as saying,</i>

39
00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:12.039
<i>"These composers are
having a conversation</i>

40
00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:15.035
<i>and it may not
always be so polite."</i>

41
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.643
<i>Lydia Tár has also written
music for the stage and screen.</i>

42
00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:22.382
<i>She is in fact one of only 15
so-called EGOTs, meaning those</i>

43
00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:26.714
<i>who have won all four
major entertainment awards:</i>

44
00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.383
<i>an Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar and a Tony.</i>

45
00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.961
<i>It is, as you can imagine,</i>

46
00:07:32.096 --> 00:07:34.425
<i>an extremely short
and shimmering list</i>

47
00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:37.594
<i>that includes Richard
Rodgers, Audrey Hepburn,</i>

48
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.503
<i>Andrew Lloyd Webber
and, of course, Mel Brooks.</i>

49
00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.735
In 2010, with the
support of Eliot Kaplan,

50
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:51.741
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

51
00:07:51.877 --> 00:07:54.774
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

52
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.986
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

53
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.914
with major orchestras
around the world.

54
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.023
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

55
00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:08.621
in succession to Andris Davis,

56
00:08:08.757 --> 00:08:11.591
and she's remained
there ever since.

57
00:08:11.726 --> 00:08:13.430
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

58
00:08:13.565 --> 00:08:16.596
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

59
00:08:16.732 --> 00:08:18.772
whose nine
symphonies she recorded

60
00:08:18.907 --> 00:08:21.066
during her Big Five stints.

61
00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.541
However, she never
managed to complete

62
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:27.273
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

63
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:28.678
Under her direction,

64
00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:30.813
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

65
00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:33.614
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

66
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.684
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

67
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.451
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

68
00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:40.293
But I'm told that next month,

69
00:08:40.428 --> 00:08:42.994
she'll make a live
recording of Mahler's Fifth,

70
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.627
which will complete the cycle

71
00:08:44.762 --> 00:08:48.298
and will be issued in a box
set by Deutsche Grammophon

72
00:08:48.434 --> 00:08:50.469
just in time for
Mahler's birthday.

73
00:08:50.605 --> 00:08:54.340
As if that's not enough,
her new book, <i>Tár on Tár,</i>

74
00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:58.136
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

75
00:08:58.272 --> 00:09:01.313
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

76
00:09:01.449 --> 00:09:03.716
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

77
00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:06.946
All of us at <i>The New
Yorker</i> welcome you.

78
00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:08.756
Thank you for joining
us, Maestro, today.

79
00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:10.583
Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

80
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:13.193
Thank you.

81
00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:16.429
Lydia, I couldn't...

82
00:09:16.564 --> 00:09:19.766
I couldn't help but see
you flinch just a little bit

83
00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:21.400
as I was reading your bio.

84
00:09:21.535 --> 00:09:23.634
Was it because I forgot some
other amazing achievement?

85
00:09:23.635 --> 00:09:26.006
Or do you have a
slight self-consciousness

86
00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:28.170
about the incredibly
varied things

87
00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:30.211
that you've accomplished?

88
00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:35.345
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

89
00:09:35.481 --> 00:09:37.449
I mean, our era is
one of specialists,

90
00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:40.383
and if you're trying to
do more than one thing,

91
00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:42.185
it's, you know, it's
often frowned upon.

92
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.790
Every artist gets typecast.

93
00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:45.292
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

94
00:09:45.427 --> 00:09:47.194
Well, do you think there'll
be a moment, though,

95
00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:49.229
when the classical
music community,

96
00:09:49.364 --> 00:09:52.700
uh, decides not to
use sexual distinctions

97
00:09:52.836 --> 00:09:54.870
to differentiate artists?

98
00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:57.070
I'm probably the
wrong person to ask

99
00:09:57.206 --> 00:09:59.531
since I don't, uh, read reviews.

100
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.100
- Never, really?
- No.

101
00:10:01.236 --> 00:10:05.311
But it is odd, I-I think, that
anyone ever felt compelled

102
00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:08.283
to substitute "maestro"
with "maestra."

103
00:10:08.419 --> 00:10:11.614
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

104
00:10:11.749 --> 00:10:13.385
Mm-hmm. Right.

105
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.158
But as to the question
of, uh, gender bias,

106
00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:19.723
I really have nothing
to complain about.

107
00:10:19.859 --> 00:10:22.889
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

108
00:10:23.024 --> 00:10:25.165
uh, Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

109
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.932
I mean, there's so
many incredible women

110
00:10:28.068 --> 00:10:29.401
who came before us.

111
00:10:29.536 --> 00:10:31.837
You know, women who
did the-the real lifting.

112
00:10:31.973 --> 00:10:33.071
That-that's fascinating.

113
00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:35.070
Can you... Who, for instance?

114
00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:36.308
Uh, okay, sure.

115
00:10:36.443 --> 00:10:38.509
Uh, first and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

116
00:10:38.644 --> 00:10:41.477
I mean, that would be
the, uh, happy example.

117
00:10:41.613 --> 00:10:44.747
Uh, the sad one
would be Antonia Brico,

118
00:10:44.882 --> 00:10:47.651
who by all accounts was
an incredible conductor

119
00:10:47.786 --> 00:10:51.022
but was ghettoized into
the nonglamorous status

120
00:10:51.157 --> 00:10:53.093
of a "guest conductor"

121
00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:55.997
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

122
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:58.260
A dog... Uh, she
never got the chance

123
00:10:58.396 --> 00:10:59.436
to lead a major orchestra?

124
00:10:59.565 --> 00:11:01.500
Well, yes. Yes,
she did, uh, conduct

125
00:11:01.636 --> 00:11:03.929
the, uh, Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

126
00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:07.098
but, again, only as
a guest conductor.

127
00:11:07.234 --> 00:11:08.954
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

128
00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:11.208
it was all gender spectacle.

129
00:11:11.344 --> 00:11:12.872
But fortunately, times change,

130
00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:14.612
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

131
00:11:14.747 --> 00:11:16.445
- "Pauline..."
- ...if not complete,

132
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.120
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

133
00:11:18.255 --> 00:11:20.780
N-No less, um, having
fallen off its horse.

134
00:11:20.916 --> 00:11:23.056
Um, Lydia, could
we talk a little bit

135
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:25.191
about, uh, translation?

136
00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:26.823
'Cause I think
there's still people

137
00:11:26.959 --> 00:11:30.330
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

138
00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:34.234
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

139
00:11:34.369 --> 00:11:36.067
- Yeah, but it's...
- But keeping time,

140
00:11:36.203 --> 00:11:37.635
it's-it's no small thing.

141
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:39.832
But I suspect there's a
lot more to it than that.

142
00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:41.338
Yeah, well, I-I
would hope so, yes.

143
00:11:41.474 --> 00:11:44.136
But time is the thing.

144
00:11:44.272 --> 00:11:48.344
Time is-is the essential
piece of, uh, interpretation.

145
00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.146
You cannot start without me.

146
00:11:50.282 --> 00:11:52.220
See, I start the clock.

147
00:11:52.356 --> 00:11:55.653
Now, my left hand
shapes, but my right hand,

148
00:11:55.789 --> 00:12:00.153
the second hand, marks
time and moves it forward.

149
00:12:00.288 --> 00:12:04.030
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

150
00:12:04.165 --> 00:12:07.168
which means that time stops.

151
00:12:07.303 --> 00:12:10.338
Now, the illusion
is that, like you,

152
00:12:10.473 --> 00:12:12.574
I'm responding to the
orchestra in real time...

153
00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:14.969
-Right, right.
-... making the decision about the right moment

154
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.343
to restart the
thing, or reset it,

155
00:12:16.478 --> 00:12:19.171
or throw time out the
window altogether.

156
00:12:19.307 --> 00:12:22.347
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

157
00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:24.450
I know precisely
what time it is...

158
00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.388
- Really? That's...
- ...and the exact moment

159
00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:29.389
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

160
00:12:29.524 --> 00:12:33.056
You know, the only
real, uh, discovery for me

161
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:34.953
is in rehearsal.

162
00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.860
It's never, never
in performance.

163
00:12:36.996 --> 00:12:40.894
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

164
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.898
that Bernstein gave
you, what would it be?

165
00:12:45.676 --> 00:12:47.140
Kavvanah.

166
00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:48.515
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

167
00:12:48.608 --> 00:12:51.411
for attention to
meaning or-or intent.

168
00:12:51.547 --> 00:12:53.307
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

169
00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:55.682
and what are yours, and how
do they complement one another?

170
00:12:55.683 --> 00:12:57.686
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

171
00:12:57.687 --> 00:12:59.807
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

172
00:12:59.886 --> 00:13:03.091
Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

173
00:13:03.227 --> 00:13:04.591
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

174
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:07.228
was not always, uh,
an onstage presence

175
00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:08.794
- in classical music?
- No, that's right.

176
00:13:08.795 --> 00:13:10.729
I-I think I read someplace
that it actually was

177
00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:12.932
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

178
00:13:12.933 --> 00:13:15.628
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

179
00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:17.228
or-or skill in it or not.

180
00:13:17.364 --> 00:13:20.067
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

181
00:13:20.202 --> 00:13:23.235
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

182
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.240
who reportedly, uh, used
a, uh, rather enormous,

183
00:13:27.376 --> 00:13:31.249
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

184
00:13:31.384 --> 00:13:32.518
It's not something I imagine

185
00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:34.984
the players particularly,
uh, appreciated.

186
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.925
Uh, anyway, uh, that technique
ended during a performance

187
00:13:39.061 --> 00:13:40.924
when Lully accidentally

188
00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:43.255
stabbed himself in the
foot with the thing and died.

189
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.096
Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

190
00:13:46.232 --> 00:13:48.001
But anyway...

191
00:13:48.136 --> 00:13:50.872
Yeah.

192
00:13:51.008 --> 00:13:54.266
Anyway, but the conductor

193
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:58.003
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

194
00:13:58.139 --> 00:14:00.547
And once again, we
go back to Beethoven.

195
00:14:00.682 --> 00:14:03.615
♪ Buh, buh, buh, bum,
buh, buh, buh, bum. ♪

196
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.649
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

197
00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:08.218
The downbeat-- ♪
Buh, buh, buh ♪--

198
00:14:08.354 --> 00:14:10.015
It's silent, right?

199
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:12.526
So someone had
to start that clock.

200
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:15.525
Someone had to, uh,
plant their flag in the sand

201
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.225
and say, "Follow me," you know?

202
00:14:18.361 --> 00:14:21.633
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

203
00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:25.802
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

204
00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:28.867
'Cause he knew the
music, Mahler especially,

205
00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:31.003
as well or better than anyone.

206
00:14:31.138 --> 00:14:34.314
And he would often
play with the form.

207
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.847
'Cause he wanted
an orchestra to feel

208
00:14:35.848 --> 00:14:37.977
that they had never
seen, let alone heard

209
00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:40.980
or-or performed
any of that music.

210
00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:43.257
So he-he would
do radical things,

211
00:14:43.393 --> 00:14:45.524
like, uh, disregarding
the tempo primo

212
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.053
or-or ending this
phrase molto ritardando,

213
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:50.690
even though it had
no such marking.

214
00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.066
Was he over-egging it?

215
00:14:52.201 --> 00:14:53.567
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

216
00:14:53.702 --> 00:14:57.368
He, he, he celebrated
the joy of his discovery.

217
00:14:57.504 --> 00:14:58.902
You just told us a moment ago

218
00:14:59.037 --> 00:15:01.409
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

219
00:15:01.544 --> 00:15:04.038
When will that process
begin again for you?

220
00:15:04.982 --> 00:15:06.277
We start on Monday.

221
00:15:06.413 --> 00:15:08.249
Immediately?

222
00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:10.684
With this one,
it really is about

223
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:15.213
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

224
00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:16.869
I mean, we know a
great deal about this

225
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:18.516
with his other symphonies.

226
00:15:18.652 --> 00:15:20.759
You know, he was so
inspired by the poetry of Rückert

227
00:15:20.894 --> 00:15:23.198
that for years he didn't
set another author to music.

228
00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:26.198
But all of this
changes with the Five.

229
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.531
The Five is a mystery.

230
00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:31.306
And the only clue he leaves us

231
00:15:31.442 --> 00:15:33.374
is on the cover of
the manuscript itself.

232
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.378
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

233
00:15:37.514 --> 00:15:39.377
So if you're gonna
partner with Mahler

234
00:15:39.512 --> 00:15:42.215
on his, uh, fifth symphony,

235
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.749
the first thing you must do

236
00:15:43.884 --> 00:15:48.216
is try to understand that
very complex marriage.

237
00:15:48.352 --> 00:15:51.084
And would you say that you
have a different interpretation

238
00:15:51.219 --> 00:15:53.527
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

239
00:15:55.062 --> 00:15:59.496
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

240
00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:02.303
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

241
00:16:02.438 --> 00:16:05.073
only receive an <i>icaro,</i> or song,

242
00:16:05.209 --> 00:16:06.806
if the singer is there, right?

243
00:16:06.942 --> 00:16:10.678
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

244
00:16:10.813 --> 00:16:14.273
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

245
00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:17.783
It's the flip sides of
the same cosmic coin.

246
00:16:17.918 --> 00:16:20.783
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

247
00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:23.314
But Lenny, he
believed in <i>teshuvah.</i>

248
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.757
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

249
00:16:25.892 --> 00:16:28.754
and-and transform
the, uh, significance

250
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.324
of one's past deeds.

251
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.464
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

252
00:16:34.599 --> 00:16:36.636
it ran for 12 minutes.

253
00:16:36.772 --> 00:16:39.101
He treated it as a mass.

254
00:16:39.237 --> 00:16:41.072
And, you know, if you
listen to a recording of it,

255
00:16:41.073 --> 00:16:44.708
you will no doubt feel the
tragedy and-and the pathos.

256
00:16:44.844 --> 00:16:47.381
And of course that,
uh, interpretation

257
00:16:47.517 --> 00:16:49.517
was very true for
Mahler later in life,

258
00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:51.616
after the professional
bottom dropped out

259
00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:53.686
and Alma had left
him for Gropius.

260
00:16:53.822 --> 00:16:58.956
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

261
00:16:59.091 --> 00:17:03.527
And this piece was not
born into aching tragedy.

262
00:17:03.662 --> 00:17:05.967
It was born into young love.

263
00:17:06.103 --> 00:17:08.231
And so you chose...

264
00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:09.802
Love.

265
00:17:09.938 --> 00:17:12.832
Right, but precisely how long?

266
00:17:12.967 --> 00:17:14.238
Well...

267
00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:16.306
seven minutes.

268
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:23.348
I was so taken by
what you said to Adam

269
00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:26.649
about, um, interpretation

270
00:17:26.784 --> 00:17:30.156
and specifically about feelings,

271
00:17:30.292 --> 00:17:32.551
and that you chose love.

272
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.887
And I know it's said that
you should leave the tears

273
00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:37.994
for the audience, but...

274
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.764
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

275
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.500
when you're up
there at the podium?

276
00:17:42.635 --> 00:17:44.402
Yes.

277
00:17:44.537 --> 00:17:46.365
Yes, that does happen.

278
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.509
There's an... an
expectation-reward cycle

279
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:51.613
with some works
and the spots in them

280
00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:54.547
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

281
00:17:54.683 --> 00:17:56.948
it's not that I'm
rushing exactly,

282
00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:59.686
but, oh, I just can't
wait to get to that spot,

283
00:17:59.822 --> 00:18:02.121
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

284
00:18:03.825 --> 00:18:05.690
So it's physical as
well as emotional.

285
00:18:05.825 --> 00:18:07.690
God, it must take hours

286
00:18:07.825 --> 00:18:09.929
to come back down to earth.

287
00:18:10.064 --> 00:18:13.399
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

288
00:18:13.534 --> 00:18:15.635
And sleep, it's impossible.

289
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.763
It's like my freshman
year at Smith.

290
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:22.867
Which piece does that to you?

291
00:18:23.003 --> 00:18:24.304
Oh, I saw you.

292
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.576
I saw you conduct,
uh, <i>The Rite of Spring</i>

293
00:18:26.711 --> 00:18:28.082
at the Met last year.

294
00:18:28.218 --> 00:18:30.209
It was so powerful.

295
00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:32.387
Thank you. Thank you.

296
00:18:32.522 --> 00:18:35.387
It's... It's the
11 pistol shots--

297
00:18:35.522 --> 00:18:36.756
It's a prime number--

298
00:18:36.891 --> 00:18:39.251
That strike you as both
victim and perpetrator.

299
00:18:39.387 --> 00:18:40.907
You know, it's not
until I conducted it

300
00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:44.566
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

301
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:47.325
That is a fantastic
handbag, by the way.

302
00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.894
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

303
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:51.497
Oh, I do. I do.

304
00:18:51.632 --> 00:18:53.405
Sorry. Your lunch
with Mr. Kaplan.

305
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.141
His driver is waiting.

306
00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:56.401
All right.

307
00:18:56.537 --> 00:18:57.711
I-I'm sorry, I've
forgotten your name.

308
00:18:57.712 --> 00:18:59.179
- Whitney. Whitney Reese.
- Whitney.

309
00:18:59.315 --> 00:19:00.315
Whitney, of course.

310
00:19:00.447 --> 00:19:01.815
I'm, I'm so sorry,

311
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.642
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

312
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:05.044
- and there's something I can't get out of.
- Oh.

313
00:19:05.045 --> 00:19:06.086
I understand.

314
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:08.623
Can I text you?

315
00:19:27.739 --> 00:19:29.941
It's perfect, Aldo.

316
00:19:32.572 --> 00:19:34.972
Oh. I was hoping
we could celebrate.

317
00:19:35.108 --> 00:19:37.109
No. So was I.

318
00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:38.778
I've got a class at Juilliard.

319
00:19:38.913 --> 00:19:39.944
Oh, good.

320
00:19:40.079 --> 00:19:41.482
I promised Ben.

321
00:19:41.618 --> 00:19:45.055
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

322
00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:48.630
We should open
up the fellowship.

323
00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:50.963
- What, expand our numbers?
- No, our sex.

324
00:19:51.099 --> 00:19:54.301
I mean, it feels quaint to
keep things single-gender.

325
00:19:54.436 --> 00:19:55.636
We've made our point.

326
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:57.395
And, honestly, we've
had no real trouble

327
00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:59.370
successfully
placing any of them.

328
00:19:59.505 --> 00:20:01.306
Except one.

329
00:20:01.441 --> 00:20:03.077
Oh, well.

330
00:20:03.212 --> 00:20:05.211
She had issues.

331
00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:06.846
So I've heard.

332
00:20:06.982 --> 00:20:08.973
The topic comes up in
every Citibank meeting

333
00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:11.384
with her father.

334
00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:12.988
I'm sorry about that.

335
00:20:13.123 --> 00:20:14.179
It's fine.

336
00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:16.485
It's nothing I can't handle.

337
00:20:17.454 --> 00:20:21.690
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

338
00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:23.727
We'd likely lose donors.

339
00:20:23.862 --> 00:20:26.325
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

340
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:28.401
M-Maybe it's
something we revisit

341
00:20:28.536 --> 00:20:30.397
- down the line.
- Sure.

342
00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:32.903
Now, Bryant Park's
locked for the 25th.

343
00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:35.005
Nan asked me to
help fill the place,

344
00:20:35.141 --> 00:20:36.837
so the Kaplan Fund is
gonna buy some radio

345
00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:39.003
and outdoor advertising.

346
00:20:39.139 --> 00:20:41.182
And claqueurs.

347
00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:42.506
It's too big, Eliot.

348
00:20:42.642 --> 00:20:44.051
She should have
booked the Strand.

349
00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:45.383
Relax.

350
00:20:45.518 --> 00:20:47.622
It'll be great.

351
00:20:47.758 --> 00:20:50.153
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

352
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.461
I was, uh, I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

353
00:20:54.597 --> 00:20:56.665
to my Mahler Three in London.

354
00:20:57.496 --> 00:20:59.195
Me, too.

355
00:21:00.537 --> 00:21:02.902
Uh, Petra had a school thing.

356
00:21:03.037 --> 00:21:07.676
Uh, and I promised
Sharon I'd be there.

357
00:21:08.706 --> 00:21:10.711
Of course.

358
00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:13.946
I was just hoping for
your honest opinion.

359
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:16.813
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

360
00:21:16.949 --> 00:21:18.786
Those are confidential, Eliot.

361
00:21:18.921 --> 00:21:21.217
Well, the principal
oboist is a big fan.

362
00:21:22.456 --> 00:21:23.725
On the way back,

363
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.686
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

364
00:21:25.687 --> 00:21:27.552
and I was struck by
what you managed to pull

365
00:21:27.688 --> 00:21:29.894
from the strings in
the last movement.

366
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.497
I mean, how did
you get them there?

367
00:21:33.632 --> 00:21:35.060
Was it the hall?

368
00:21:35.196 --> 00:21:36.661
Was it the players?

369
00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:39.739
The players
weren't very obliging.

370
00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.474
The principal violinist
came up to me

371
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.742
after the first rehearsal

372
00:21:42.878 --> 00:21:44.903
- and asked if I was a Jew.
- What?

373
00:21:45.038 --> 00:21:47.849
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

374
00:21:47.984 --> 00:21:50.950
would be interested in
conducting Jewish music.

375
00:21:51.085 --> 00:21:53.953
Felt like Max Bruch.

376
00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:57.416
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has, uh,

377
00:21:57.551 --> 00:21:59.418
committed a sizable
amount to them

378
00:21:59.553 --> 00:22:01.027
for a klezmer commission.

379
00:22:01.162 --> 00:22:03.027
Uh, maybe they'll invite
me to guest conduct.

380
00:22:03.163 --> 00:22:05.089
Oh, well, they'd be
lucky to have you.

381
00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:06.992
Oh, please.

382
00:22:07.127 --> 00:22:08.967
I know my place.

383
00:22:09.103 --> 00:22:11.740
Money can't always
buy you everything.

384
00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:14.809
You don't really believe that.

385
00:22:14.945 --> 00:22:16.939
I'll have you know I
tried to bribe Francesca

386
00:22:17.074 --> 00:22:18.642
to let me look at your notation.

387
00:22:18.778 --> 00:22:20.214
She sent me packing.

388
00:22:20.349 --> 00:22:21.840
Good girl.

389
00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:24.611
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

390
00:22:24.612 --> 00:22:26.854
is urgently focused
on our table.

391
00:22:26.989 --> 00:22:30.119
At first, I thought he
was looking at me,

392
00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:32.393
but I think he's
got his eye on you.

393
00:22:32.529 --> 00:22:34.290
Please try and ignore him.

394
00:22:34.425 --> 00:22:36.529
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

395
00:22:36.665 --> 00:22:38.290
if you'd like to be alone.

396
00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:41.166
And I would never forgive you.

397
00:22:41.302 --> 00:22:43.394
The last thing I need is
to be buttonholed in here

398
00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:45.466
by someone exactly like me.

399
00:22:47.009 --> 00:22:48.977
Uh, what time are
you leaving tomorrow?

400
00:22:49.813 --> 00:22:52.203
Francesca's
looking into flights.

401
00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:53.545
Well, call her off.

402
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:55.372
Leave when you like.

403
00:22:55.508 --> 00:22:57.148
You don't have to do that.

404
00:22:57.283 --> 00:23:00.988
My motives are
not entirely altruistic.

405
00:23:01.123 --> 00:23:03.521
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

406
00:23:06.394 --> 00:23:07.760
Fine.

407
00:23:07.895 --> 00:23:10.889
- Would 5:15 be okay?
- Sure.

408
00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:13.864
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

409
00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:16.198
We're filling a vacant position.

410
00:23:16.333 --> 00:23:18.372
Oh, please tell
me it's Sebastian.

411
00:23:18.508 --> 00:23:19.739
Now, be fair, Eliot.

412
00:23:19.874 --> 00:23:22.199
Sebastian has decent technique.

413
00:23:22.335 --> 00:23:23.601
He has baton.

414
00:23:23.737 --> 00:23:25.177
A month ago, I
dropped into Bunkamura

415
00:23:25.246 --> 00:23:28.344
to watch the Turing
machine trot out Chopin One.

416
00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:31.880
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

417
00:23:32.016 --> 00:23:33.585
Robot-o is more like it.

418
00:23:33.721 --> 00:23:34.921
Why do you keep him on?

419
00:23:35.056 --> 00:23:37.253
Oh, he's Andris's
man, you know that.

420
00:23:37.388 --> 00:23:39.027
Exactly. You
inherited that decision.

421
00:23:39.162 --> 00:23:41.162
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

422
00:23:41.163 --> 00:23:43.491
They have different
labor contracts over there.

423
00:23:45.768 --> 00:23:48.731
He's a... he's a strange guy.

424
00:23:48.866 --> 00:23:50.227
Who? Andris?

425
00:23:50.363 --> 00:23:52.231
No, Sebastian.

426
00:23:52.366 --> 00:23:54.705
He has, uh, fetishes.

427
00:23:54.841 --> 00:23:56.703
Fetishes? Like what?

428
00:23:56.838 --> 00:24:00.405
Nostalgia for prewar
Kalmus miniature scores,

429
00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.374
dead-stock pencils he's seen

430
00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:04.409
von Karajan hold in photographs.

431
00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:06.377
You know, that sort of thing.

432
00:24:06.513 --> 00:24:08.857
That's just sad.

433
00:24:12.926 --> 00:24:15.391
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

434
00:24:15.526 --> 00:24:18.526
I am gonna have to
rotate him at some point.

435
00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:23.201
For who?

436
00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:28.971
<i>What Love Teaches Me.</i>

437
00:24:29.106 --> 00:24:31.374
That string notation.

438
00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:35.048
Mahler gives it to you himself.

439
00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.543
Languid, peaceful, deeply felt.

440
00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:38.260
- Come on.
- Trust me. Languid, peaceful, deeply felt.

441
00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:38.752
- Come on.
- Trust me.

442
00:24:38.887 --> 00:24:40.250
You do not want to go to school

443
00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:42.786
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

444
00:24:42.922 --> 00:24:44.424
Least of all, mine.

445
00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.917
Oh, but I do.

446
00:24:46.052 --> 00:24:47.461
All right. Will you
quit pestering me?

447
00:24:47.462 --> 00:24:49.429
Yes.

448
00:24:49.564 --> 00:24:51.559
Free bowing.

449
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:55.299
It's not pretty for an
audience to look at,

450
00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:57.067
but if you can manage
to keep your players

451
00:24:57.068 --> 00:24:58.940
out of the weeds...

452
00:24:59.775 --> 00:25:01.976
...the sound's ferocious.

453
00:25:08.908 --> 00:25:11.953
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

454
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:17.585
Do your own thing.

455
00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:42.340
All right, um...

456
00:25:42.476 --> 00:25:44.985
Let's... stop here.

457
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.821
- Thank you, Max. Very good.
- Thanks.

458
00:25:46.956 --> 00:25:51.758
Um, just for my
own edification...

459
00:25:51.894 --> 00:25:53.989
why did you come to Juilliard?

460
00:25:57.365 --> 00:25:59.564
Uh, it's the best music
conservatory in the country?

461
00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:02.694
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

462
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.171
I mean, Juilliard's
a brand, right?

463
00:26:05.306 --> 00:26:08.007
So, did you come to
study with a brand?

464
00:26:08.143 --> 00:26:10.276
- No.
- No, right. So there's a teacher

465
00:26:10.412 --> 00:26:12.705
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

466
00:26:12.841 --> 00:26:14.347
conjured something
in your imagination.

467
00:26:14.348 --> 00:26:16.583
- Someone you aspire to be yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:16.718 --> 00:26:18.342
So, who was that?

469
00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:19.852
Sarah Chang.

470
00:26:19.987 --> 00:26:21.755
Hmm. So you're a violinist?

471
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.524
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

472
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.126
Well, I can see why

473
00:26:25.261 --> 00:26:27.854
you would choose to
conduct a piece like this.

474
00:26:27.989 --> 00:26:30.263
Must be a familiar
pleasure in presiding over

475
00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:33.097
a bed of strings that
behave as if they're tuning.

476
00:26:33.232 --> 00:26:35.065
Now...

477
00:26:35.201 --> 00:26:39.699
this piece is very au courant.

478
00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:42.208
I mean, here, the
composer tells us

479
00:26:42.343 --> 00:26:44.377
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes

480
00:26:44.513 --> 00:26:48.413
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

481
00:26:48.548 --> 00:26:50.979
Sounds like René
Redzepi's recipe for reindeer.

482
00:26:52.716 --> 00:26:55.380
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

483
00:26:55.516 --> 00:26:56.718
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

484
00:26:56.853 --> 00:27:00.193
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

485
00:27:01.527 --> 00:27:04.989
Now, I know you're
all conducting students

486
00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:07.768
of, uh, Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

487
00:27:07.904 --> 00:27:10.967
are also studying composition?

488
00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:12.572
Right, what's your name?

489
00:27:12.707 --> 00:27:14.003
Olive Kerr.

490
00:27:14.139 --> 00:27:16.574
All right, Olive. Uh...

491
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.074
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

492
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.081
It's pretty awesome.

493
00:27:21.217 --> 00:27:24.148
I mean, there's
incredible atonal tension.

494
00:27:24.283 --> 00:27:26.485
I agree about the tension part.

495
00:27:26.621 --> 00:27:30.355
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

496
00:27:30.491 --> 00:27:34.284
about the felicity of
the so-called "atonal,"

497
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.963
but the important question
here is: What are you conducting?

498
00:27:40.099 --> 00:27:41.263
What is the effect?

499
00:27:41.398 --> 00:27:44.269
What is it actually doing to me?

500
00:27:44.405 --> 00:27:48.137
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

501
00:27:48.273 --> 00:27:50.377
or bare as a potting shed

502
00:27:50.513 --> 00:27:53.880
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

503
00:27:54.015 --> 00:27:56.113
Max.

504
00:27:56.248 --> 00:27:58.581
Come on, what do you think?

505
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.292
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

506
00:28:06.428 --> 00:28:10.321
she said she was often
influenced by the form

507
00:28:10.456 --> 00:28:15.829
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

508
00:28:15.964 --> 00:28:18.204
But I'm not sure she
was interested per se

509
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.533
in, uh, describing
those actual sounds.

510
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:24.211
Very <i>Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i>

511
00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:26.843
Yes.

512
00:28:26.978 --> 00:28:31.649
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

513
00:28:31.785 --> 00:28:36.551
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

514
00:28:36.687 --> 00:28:40.155
have a point of
view about anything?

515
00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:41.724
Now, to be fair, I mean,

516
00:28:41.859 --> 00:28:44.255
there are times when you
will simply have no choice.

517
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:46.763
And you will be made to
stand in front of an orchestra

518
00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:50.067
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

519
00:28:50.202 --> 00:28:53.163
But my prayer for you

520
00:28:53.299 --> 00:28:55.374
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

521
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:57.672
of standing on the
podium with a 4'33",

522
00:28:57.808 --> 00:29:00.340
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

523
00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:02.674
Because now, my friends,

524
00:29:02.809 --> 00:29:05.879
now is the time to conduct music

525
00:29:06.014 --> 00:29:09.222
that actually requires
something of you.

526
00:29:09.357 --> 00:29:10.853
You know, music
that everybody knows

527
00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:15.524
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

528
00:29:15.659 --> 00:29:19.391
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

529
00:29:19.526 --> 00:29:24.595
You know, like, uh, something
like Bach's <i>Mass in B minor.</i>

530
00:29:26.272 --> 00:29:28.107
I'm not really into Bach.

531
00:29:28.242 --> 00:29:30.873
You're not into Bach?

532
00:29:31.009 --> 00:29:32.808
Oh, Max.

533
00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:35.812
Have you read the
Schweitzer book?

534
00:29:35.948 --> 00:29:37.575
No.

535
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.049
Well, you should.

536
00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:41.383
It's an important text.

537
00:29:41.519 --> 00:29:43.787
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

538
00:29:43.923 --> 00:29:46.724
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

539
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:49.560
and canoed up the Congo
River to track Schweitzer down

540
00:29:49.695 --> 00:29:52.728
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

541
00:29:52.864 --> 00:29:54.735
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

542
00:29:54.871 --> 00:29:56.968
in a, in a pith helmet.

543
00:29:57.104 --> 00:29:58.437
I mean, have you...

544
00:29:58.572 --> 00:30:02.474
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

545
00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:08.148
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

546
00:30:08.284 --> 00:30:10.084
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

547
00:30:10.219 --> 00:30:13.085
makes it kind of
impossible for me

548
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.619
to take his music seriously.

549
00:30:17.055 --> 00:30:18.656
Come on.

550
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.623
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

551
00:30:21.759 --> 00:30:25.799
Well, didn't he
sire, like, 20 kids?

552
00:30:25.935 --> 00:30:27.961
Yes, that's documented.

553
00:30:28.096 --> 00:30:31.534
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

554
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.134
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

555
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:36.777
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

556
00:30:36.913 --> 00:30:39.943
have to do with B minor.

557
00:30:40.078 --> 00:30:41.382
Sure.

558
00:30:41.517 --> 00:30:44.275
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

559
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.146
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

560
00:30:47.281 --> 00:30:49.982
But remember, the
flip side of that selection

561
00:30:50.118 --> 00:30:52.787
closes the valves
of one's attention.

562
00:30:52.923 --> 00:30:57.288
Now, of course, siloing
what is acceptable

563
00:30:57.423 --> 00:31:00.498
or not acceptable is a
basic construct of many,

564
00:31:00.634 --> 00:31:03.137
if not most, symphony
orchestras today,

565
00:31:03.272 --> 00:31:05.037
who see it as
their imperial right

566
00:31:05.173 --> 00:31:06.797
to curate for the cretins.

567
00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:08.640
So, slippery as it is,

568
00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:12.479
there is some merit in
examining Max's allergy.

569
00:31:12.614 --> 00:31:15.713
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

570
00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:19.144
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

571
00:31:19.279 --> 00:31:21.520
individually as-as
well as collectively,

572
00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:25.656
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

573
00:31:26.659 --> 00:31:29.026
You know, what about Beethoven?

574
00:31:29.162 --> 00:31:30.989
You into him?

575
00:31:31.125 --> 00:31:33.663
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

576
00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:37.030
I'm... I'm not too
sure about old Ludwig.

577
00:31:38.139 --> 00:31:41.404
But then, I face him.

578
00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.673
And I find myself nose-to-nose

579
00:31:43.808 --> 00:31:48.382
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

580
00:31:50.548 --> 00:31:53.515
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

581
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.021
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

582
00:32:01.764 --> 00:32:03.331
Sit.

583
00:32:06.158 --> 00:32:08.865
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

584
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.704
I mean, it could be a
first-year piano student.

585
00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:18.511
♪ Or Schroeder
playing for Lucy. ♪

586
00:32:20.413 --> 00:32:22.845
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

587
00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:29.918
Now, it's not
until it changes...

588
00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:32.422
...when you get inside it,

589
00:32:32.557 --> 00:32:34.058
that you hear what it really is.

590
00:32:34.193 --> 00:32:35.891
It's a question.

591
00:32:38.297 --> 00:32:40.401
And an answer.

592
00:32:42.028 --> 00:32:44.636
Which begs another question.

593
00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:48.905
There's a humility in Bach.

594
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.842
He's not pretending he's
certain about anything.

595
00:32:52.977 --> 00:32:56.006
'Cause he knows that
it's always the question

596
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:59.086
that involves the listener.

597
00:32:59.222 --> 00:33:02.179
It's never the answer, right?

598
00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:05.688
Now, the big
question for you is:

599
00:33:05.824 --> 00:33:08.396
What do you think, Max?

600
00:33:14.235 --> 00:33:16.099
You play really well.

601
00:33:16.235 --> 00:33:22.375
But nowadays, white, male,
cis composers, just not my thing.

602
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.643
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

603
00:33:26.779 --> 00:33:28.810
The narcissism of
small differences

604
00:33:28.946 --> 00:33:31.614
leads to the most
boring conformity.

605
00:33:31.749 --> 00:33:33.648
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

606
00:33:33.783 --> 00:33:35.622
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

607
00:33:35.757 --> 00:33:38.653
Oh, well, then you must
be aware that Varèse

608
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:40.956
once famously stated that jazz

609
00:33:41.091 --> 00:33:45.456
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

610
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:48.127
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

611
00:33:48.262 --> 00:33:50.295
for his <i>Planet of
the Apes</i> score.

612
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:52.737
It's kind of a perfect
insult, don't you think?

613
00:33:52.873 --> 00:33:56.509
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

614
00:33:56.644 --> 00:33:59.009
as an ultrasonic
epistemic dissident

615
00:33:59.145 --> 00:34:02.714
is that if Bach's talent can
be reduced to his gender,

616
00:34:02.849 --> 00:34:05.986
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

617
00:34:06.121 --> 00:34:08.589
then so can yours.

618
00:34:08.724 --> 00:34:11.988
Now, someday, Max, when
you go out into the world

619
00:34:12.124 --> 00:34:15.762
and you guest conduct for
a major or minor orchestra,

620
00:34:15.898 --> 00:34:18.923
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

621
00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:21.425
and music on their stands.

622
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.602
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

623
00:34:24.738 --> 00:34:27.602
the purpose of
which is to rate you.

624
00:34:27.738 --> 00:34:29.939
Now, what kind of criteria

625
00:34:30.074 --> 00:34:32.670
would you hope that
they would use to do this?

626
00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:36.044
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

627
00:34:38.918 --> 00:34:42.387
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

628
00:34:42.522 --> 00:34:45.184
let's consider Max's thing.

629
00:34:45.319 --> 00:34:47.858
In this case, Anna
Thorvaldsdóttir.

630
00:34:47.993 --> 00:34:51.629
Now, can we agree on
two pieces of observation?

631
00:34:51.765 --> 00:34:54.359
One, that Anna
was born in Iceland.

632
00:34:54.494 --> 00:34:56.703
And two, that she
is, in a, I don't know,

633
00:34:56.838 --> 00:34:59.236
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

634
00:34:59.372 --> 00:35:01.265
Show of hands.

635
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.441
All right, now
let's turn our gaze

636
00:35:03.576 --> 00:35:05.535
back to the piano bench up there

637
00:35:05.671 --> 00:35:08.782
and see if we can square
how any of those things

638
00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:13.118
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

639
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:19.791
Oh, where are you going?

640
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.888
You're a fucking bitch.

641
00:35:26.367 --> 00:35:28.427
And you are a robot.

642
00:35:28.562 --> 00:35:31.062
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

643
00:35:31.197 --> 00:35:33.731
appears to be social media.

644
00:35:33.866 --> 00:35:37.068
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

645
00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:38.412
You gotta sublimate yourself,

646
00:35:38.547 --> 00:35:41.275
your ego, and,
yes, your identity.

647
00:35:41.411 --> 00:35:44.084
You must, in fact, stand in
front of the public and God

648
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.884
and obliterate yourself.

649
00:35:49.082 --> 00:35:50.757
All right.

650
00:35:50.893 --> 00:35:52.417
During the lockdown,

651
00:35:52.552 --> 00:35:54.622
you did something I
thought remarkable.

652
00:35:54.758 --> 00:35:56.422
You made music for free.

653
00:35:56.557 --> 00:35:59.123
Anyone at all could
stream Berlin performances

654
00:35:59.258 --> 00:36:01.500
without ever paying a dime.

655
00:36:01.636 --> 00:36:03.627
Well, that-that was a...

656
00:36:03.762 --> 00:36:06.840
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

657
00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:11.042
And though I-I wish I could
claim the idea was mine,

658
00:36:11.178 --> 00:36:14.645
it really did spring from the
heart of Sharon Goodnow.

659
00:36:14.781 --> 00:36:16.216
Sharon is your partner.

660
00:36:16.352 --> 00:36:17.541
You have a child together,

661
00:36:17.677 --> 00:36:20.114
and she's also the
concertmaster for Berlin.

662
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.289
- Does that ever...
- Yes, that's right.

663
00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:23.890
...complicate things for you?

664
00:36:24.026 --> 00:36:26.226
Your work getting into your
home or the other way ar...?

665
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:41.136
Jake said he was certain

666
00:36:41.271 --> 00:36:43.143
you'd be happy with
the drape of the seat.

667
00:36:43.279 --> 00:36:44.635
I will be...

668
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.975
...if I can keep the
fat off until next month.

669
00:36:47.111 --> 00:36:49.947
You never gain weight.

670
00:36:53.456 --> 00:36:55.514
Your... your mother texted me.

671
00:36:55.649 --> 00:36:58.049
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

672
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:00.989
Next trip.

673
00:37:01.125 --> 00:37:03.358
What are you
thinking for dinner?

674
00:37:03.494 --> 00:37:05.030
Uh, no.

675
00:37:05.166 --> 00:37:07.900
No, I'm-I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

676
00:37:08.035 --> 00:37:11.662
I'm suspicious of the E
natural in the cello line.

677
00:37:11.798 --> 00:37:14.998
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

678
00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:16.741
Not-not at all.

679
00:37:16.876 --> 00:37:18.739
But don't worry,
I'll call Houston.

680
00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:20.175
They'll be flexible.

681
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:22.842
You must have some
New Haven friends

682
00:37:22.978 --> 00:37:25.012
you want to see tonight?

683
00:37:25.147 --> 00:37:27.286
No. Not really.

684
00:37:29.054 --> 00:37:32.183
Should I stop by
later for notes?

685
00:37:32.318 --> 00:37:34.189
No, that won't be necessary.

686
00:37:34.325 --> 00:37:37.159
Okay.

687
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.903
Oh, I, I-I almost forgot, but...

688
00:37:45.038 --> 00:37:47.897
this was left for
you at the front desk.

689
00:37:48.033 --> 00:37:49.076
By who?

690
00:37:49.211 --> 00:37:51.068
They didn't say.

691
00:37:51.203 --> 00:37:52.902
Wh-What, no card?

692
00:37:53.038 --> 00:37:54.076
No.

693
00:37:54.212 --> 00:37:56.114
Okay, just, just
leave it over there.

694
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.315
Thanks.

695
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.392
Good night.

696
00:38:09.527 --> 00:38:11.061
Night.

697
00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:20.565
You're listening to

698
00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:22.941
<i>All Things Considered</i>
from NPR News.

699
00:38:23.077 --> 00:38:24.637
<i>All Things Considered</i>
is brought to you

700
00:38:24.771 --> 00:38:26.276
by the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting...

701
00:38:26.277 --> 00:38:27.811
Public Broadcasting.

702
00:38:27.947 --> 00:38:29.410
...and <i>I Eat Ears,</i>

703
00:38:29.545 --> 00:38:31.826
feeding the discerning
listener since 2008.

704
00:38:31.827 --> 00:38:32.586
2008.

705
00:38:32.722 --> 00:38:33.985
<i>- I Eat Ears, - I Eat Ears,</i>

706
00:38:34.121 --> 00:38:36.350
- and you should, too.
- And you should, too.

707
00:38:37.219 --> 00:38:40.491
And now, more from NPR.

708
00:38:40.627 --> 00:38:41.861
Over the next few weeks,

709
00:38:41.996 --> 00:38:43.994
we'll be hearing
poems from four finalists

710
00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.834
for the National Youth
Poet Laureate Award.

711
00:38:55.602 --> 00:38:57.841
When were you informed of this?

712
00:38:57.977 --> 00:39:00.613
Just this morning.

713
00:39:00.748 --> 00:39:02.843
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

714
00:39:02.979 --> 00:39:04.277
I was able to get us on

715
00:39:04.413 --> 00:39:05.945
the 7:00 a.m. you
like, through Munich.

716
00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:07.115
The connection's short,

717
00:39:07.251 --> 00:39:09.279
but special services
are standing by.

718
00:39:09.415 --> 00:39:11.123
Where are things with DG?

719
00:39:11.259 --> 00:39:13.727
Please tell me they've finally
woken up to see the wisdom

720
00:39:13.863 --> 00:39:16.124
of honest-to-God
LPs for this release?

721
00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.195
No movement there yet.

722
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:20.096
Have you looked at the
email I drafted for you?

723
00:39:20.097 --> 00:39:21.362
Sent it last night.

724
00:39:21.497 --> 00:39:24.234
- Well, just forward me their response.
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.303
What's your take on
<i>The New Yorker</i> talk?

726
00:39:29.676 --> 00:39:30.871
It went well, I thought.

727
00:39:31.007 --> 00:39:32.644
Oh. You're hedging.

728
00:39:34.173 --> 00:39:35.415
I was garrulous.

729
00:39:35.551 --> 00:39:36.749
No.

730
00:39:36.885 --> 00:39:38.814
No, not at all. You,
you were fabulous.

731
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.217
Francesca.

732
00:39:41.352 --> 00:39:43.890
If you have any real
interest in conducting,

733
00:39:44.025 --> 00:39:45.820
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

734
00:39:45.956 --> 00:39:47.928
Okay. Perhaps you...

735
00:39:48.063 --> 00:39:50.363
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

736
00:39:50.498 --> 00:39:51.896
- Lenny?
- No.

737
00:39:52.032 --> 00:39:54.263
I-I was thinking about
Mahler and Alma's.

738
00:39:54.399 --> 00:39:56.199
- Oh. Huh.
- You implied that she betrayed him.

739
00:39:56.301 --> 00:39:59.437
I'm not, I'm not sure
I agree with that.

740
00:39:59.572 --> 00:40:00.869
Oh, really?

741
00:40:01.005 --> 00:40:02.566
Alma was a composer, too,

742
00:40:02.702 --> 00:40:04.744
but he insisted she
stop writing music.

743
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.409
He said there
was only room for...

744
00:40:06.545 --> 00:40:08.815
- One asshole in the house?
- One asshole in the house. Yes.

745
00:40:08.816 --> 00:40:10.508
And she agreed to those rules.

746
00:40:10.644 --> 00:40:12.747
No one made that
decision for her.

747
00:40:12.882 --> 00:40:15.922
#RulesOfTheGame.

748
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.740
If a woman has the right
to mount the scaffold,

749
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.949
she must equally have the
right to mount the podium.

750
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.950
Okay.

751
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.261
How was your evening?

752
00:40:30.396 --> 00:40:32.739
Yeah, was uneventful.

753
00:40:32.875 --> 00:40:35.105
Are there any of
Sharon's pills left?

754
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.245
No, but Dr. Korovin
called these in.

755
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:40.881
Ah, thanks.

756
00:40:48.188 --> 00:40:50.987
I received another
weird email from Krista.

757
00:40:51.122 --> 00:40:54.623
How should I reply?

758
00:40:54.758 --> 00:40:56.424
Don't.

759
00:40:58.033 --> 00:41:01.324
Well, this one felt
especially desperate.

760
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:03.298
Hope dies last.

761
00:41:03.299 --> 00:41:04.299
Hope dies last.

762
00:43:01.818 --> 00:43:04.222
Do you have some
kind of profit-sharing deal

763
00:43:04.357 --> 00:43:06.789
with the utility company
that I am unaware of?

764
00:43:08.895 --> 00:43:11.355
The flutter's back.

765
00:43:11.491 --> 00:43:14.726
It's... It's racing.

766
00:43:14.861 --> 00:43:17.031
I can't find my
Metoprolol anywhere.

767
00:43:21.569 --> 00:43:23.175
Oh, fuck.

768
00:43:35.014 --> 00:43:38.685
Uh, I found this lying
loose in the drawer.

769
00:43:41.092 --> 00:43:43.426
Is this the right one?

770
00:43:44.862 --> 00:43:46.429
Yeah.

771
00:43:51.397 --> 00:43:53.370
Thank you.

772
00:43:56.535 --> 00:43:58.569
Is that a new bag?

773
00:43:58.704 --> 00:44:00.946
Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

774
00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:02.348
You want it?

775
00:44:02.484 --> 00:44:04.051
No.

776
00:44:05.114 --> 00:44:06.576
Suits you.

777
00:44:08.454 --> 00:44:14.160
Let's slow this down
to 60 beats a minute.

778
00:44:38.149 --> 00:44:39.950
Actually, it's 64 beats.

779
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:47.627
Tried calling you on
your mobile last night.

780
00:44:49.424 --> 00:44:52.192
And again at the hotel.

781
00:44:52.328 --> 00:44:54.761
Must've been asleep.

782
00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.627
You never sleep that deeply.

783
00:44:57.763 --> 00:44:59.864
No, no, don't be a scold.

784
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.673
♪ Feelin' a feelin' ♪

785
00:45:04.776 --> 00:45:11.283
♪ For somethin' there
ain't too much of... ♪

786
00:45:12.051 --> 00:45:14.154
I'm worried about Petra.

787
00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:19.687
She's starting to
disappear into herself.

788
00:45:20.893 --> 00:45:22.690
Be specific.

789
00:45:25.664 --> 00:45:29.226
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

790
00:45:30.296 --> 00:45:33.503
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

791
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.835
I mean, I hope it's
just playground football

792
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.670
and not some <i>Biodeutsche</i> thing.

793
00:45:40.806 --> 00:45:43.546
Hmm, we talked about this.

794
00:45:44.814 --> 00:45:47.886
But maybe we just
need to put more effort

795
00:45:48.022 --> 00:45:50.856
into finding her a friend.

796
00:45:50.992 --> 00:45:52.688
Last year was really hard

797
00:45:52.824 --> 00:45:56.361
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

798
00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:02.730
She's old enough to learn piano.

799
00:46:04.662 --> 00:46:06.503
I'll teach her.

800
00:46:11.173 --> 00:46:13.240
Yeah.

801
00:46:13.376 --> 00:46:15.842
That might be good.

802
00:46:17.049 --> 00:46:19.285
How's your heart?

803
00:46:20.216 --> 00:46:22.453
Better now.

804
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:47.404
Knock, knock. Who's there?

805
00:46:47.539 --> 00:46:49.911
Lenny?

806
00:46:50.047 --> 00:46:52.246
Walter?

807
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:55.355
Oh, it's you, MTT.

808
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.419
Why do you insist on
holding things up like that?

809
00:46:58.554 --> 00:47:00.183
Your business here is rejoicing,

810
00:47:00.318 --> 00:47:03.793
not screaming like
a fucking porn star.

811
00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:05.930
Michael Tilson Thomas...

812
00:47:14.766 --> 00:47:16.738
Hello, Petra.

813
00:47:18.904 --> 00:47:21.743
Why are you lurking? Hmm?

814
00:47:22.577 --> 00:47:24.878
Tell me and I'll help.

815
00:47:25.614 --> 00:47:27.119
Sharon?

816
00:47:27.254 --> 00:47:29.480
Uh, I'm taking Petra to school.

817
00:47:29.615 --> 00:47:30.947
Oh, okay.

818
00:47:31.082 --> 00:47:33.623
- Come on.
<i>- Tschüss.</i>

819
00:47:53.512 --> 00:47:56.310
Who'll bear the pall?

820
00:47:56.446 --> 00:47:58.175
"We," said the wren,

821
00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:01.183
- "both the cock and the hen."
- The hen.

822
00:48:01.319 --> 00:48:03.089
"I'll..."

823
00:48:03.225 --> 00:48:05.418
"We'll bear the pall."

824
00:48:05.554 --> 00:48:07.250
And who'll sing a psalm?

825
00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:11.831
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

826
00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:13.866
"I'll sing a song."

827
00:48:14.002 --> 00:48:15.934
"Who'll toll the bell?"

828
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.331
"I," said the bull,

829
00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:19.938
"because I can pull.

830
00:48:20.074 --> 00:48:21.371
I'll toll the bell."

831
00:48:21.506 --> 00:48:24.208
All the birds of the air

832
00:48:24.343 --> 00:48:27.277
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

833
00:48:27.413 --> 00:48:30.278
when they heard the bell toll

834
00:48:30.414 --> 00:48:34.486
for poor Cock Robin!

835
00:48:41.153 --> 00:48:43.429
It's gonna be okay.

836
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.967
All right. Okay,
which one is she?

837
00:48:50.102 --> 00:48:52.339
The red one.

838
00:48:55.108 --> 00:48:57.036
- Bye.
- Go on.

839
00:49:08.113 --> 00:49:09.917
<i>Hallo,</i> Johanna.

840
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.940
I'm Petra's father.

841
00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.110
She's told me a lot about you.

842
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.330
I know what you're doing to her.

843
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:27.370
And if you ever do it again,
do you know what I'll do?

844
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.630
I'll get you.

845
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:36.840
And if you tell any
grown-up what I just said...

846
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.840
...they won't believe you.

847
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.810
Because I'm a grown-up.

848
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.390
But you need to believe me,

849
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.350
I will get you.

850
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:53.520
Remember this Johanna,

851
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.570
God watches us all.

852
00:50:04.179 --> 00:50:06.578
Hello. Hi.

853
00:50:13.254 --> 00:50:15.116
They're all in the chamber hall?

854
00:50:15.252 --> 00:50:16.986
Yes.

855
00:50:17.122 --> 00:50:19.426
No.

856
00:50:59.224 --> 00:51:01.666
Good morning.

857
00:51:02.698 --> 00:51:05.171
Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

858
00:51:05.306 --> 00:51:06.904
We weren't sure you were coming.

859
00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.368
We were told there might
be, um, a scheduling conflict.

860
00:51:10.503 --> 00:51:12.342
Would you like me to take notes?
-

861
00:51:12.478 --> 00:51:13.612
No, thank you, Sebastian.

862
00:51:13.748 --> 00:51:15.106
That won't be necessary.

863
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:16.745
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

864
00:51:16.881 --> 00:51:18.618
We narrowed it down to three.

865
00:51:18.753 --> 00:51:21.010
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

866
00:51:21.146 --> 00:51:23.050
let's bring in number one.

867
00:52:40.259 --> 00:52:42.799
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

868
00:52:42.935 --> 00:52:45.705
And of course, uh,
Léon was rather famous

869
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.007
- for his, um, rather wide vibrato, huh?
- Hmm.

870
00:52:50.143 --> 00:52:53.606
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

871
00:52:56.515 --> 00:52:58.442
How's the writing going?

872
00:52:58.577 --> 00:53:01.678
Ah, I never know how
to answer that question.

873
00:53:01.814 --> 00:53:02.818
No.

874
00:53:02.954 --> 00:53:05.490
Makes it sound
like a physical act.

875
00:53:05.625 --> 00:53:07.455
Like, how's the shitting going?

876
00:53:09.294 --> 00:53:10.460
Okay.

877
00:53:10.596 --> 00:53:12.461
How's the thinking going?

878
00:53:12.596 --> 00:53:14.832
Yeah, not so well.

879
00:53:14.967 --> 00:53:17.470
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

880
00:53:17.606 --> 00:53:21.038
only to catch
myself in pastiche.

881
00:53:22.673 --> 00:53:24.807
Uh, it's all pastiche.

882
00:53:24.943 --> 00:53:27.313
We all have the same
musical grammar.

883
00:53:27.448 --> 00:53:30.147
Uh, just look at Beethoven Five.

884
00:53:30.283 --> 00:53:33.347
The third movement's theme
has the same sequence of intervals

885
00:53:33.483 --> 00:53:37.051
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

886
00:53:37.186 --> 00:53:39.522
Mm, th-that could've
been a coincidence.

887
00:53:39.657 --> 00:53:41.527
No. Not in this case.

888
00:53:41.663 --> 00:53:44.354
If you examine the
sketchbooks he used,

889
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:48.431
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

890
00:53:48.567 --> 00:53:50.769
Copied out by Beethoven.

891
00:53:50.904 --> 00:53:55.002
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

892
00:53:55.137 --> 00:53:56.836
I finished reading
your manuscript.

893
00:53:56.971 --> 00:53:58.573
It's very good, Lydia.

894
00:53:58.708 --> 00:54:00.678
One for the ages.

895
00:54:00.814 --> 00:54:02.945
And, I dare say,
will be available

896
00:54:03.081 --> 00:54:04.613
long after my book
has been forgotten.

897
00:54:04.748 --> 00:54:06.248
Oh, yes, you're right.

898
00:54:06.383 --> 00:54:09.717
The entire first printing
will always be available.

899
00:54:09.852 --> 00:54:12.087
Too modest, as usual.

900
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.834
Thank you, Andris.

901
00:54:23.733 --> 00:54:25.533
I'll cherish this.

902
00:54:25.668 --> 00:54:27.735
You may use it.

903
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:30.204
A-a blurb for the covers.

904
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.907
Oh, thank you.

905
00:54:34.043 --> 00:54:35.909
I'll send it to the publisher.

906
00:54:36.045 --> 00:54:37.912
Hopefully, there's still time.

907
00:54:38.047 --> 00:54:40.386
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

908
00:54:40.521 --> 00:54:41.801
uh, even though there was really

909
00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:43.080
nothing I could teach you.

910
00:54:43.215 --> 00:54:44.517
Now, that's not true.

911
00:54:44.653 --> 00:54:47.417
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

912
00:54:47.552 --> 00:54:49.789
Then you'd be in
London, New York.

913
00:54:49.925 --> 00:54:51.896
They're not Berlin.

914
00:54:53.033 --> 00:54:55.400
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

915
00:54:55.535 --> 00:54:56.667
were we ever to leave.

916
00:54:56.802 --> 00:54:58.503
She's so close with her family.

917
00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:02.072
Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

918
00:55:02.208 --> 00:55:04.773
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

919
00:55:04.908 --> 00:55:07.846
while she still held sway at DG.

920
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:12.008
- Heike is a woman of many opinions.
- Oh.

921
00:55:12.143 --> 00:55:13.143
And that voice.

922
00:55:13.215 --> 00:55:14.535
I mean, the
signal-to-noise ratio,

923
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:16.756
it's unbearable.

924
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.917
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

925
00:55:19.053 --> 00:55:21.585
to get any writing done.

926
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.092
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

927
00:55:23.093 --> 00:55:25.263
against his
sensitivity to noise.

928
00:55:26.959 --> 00:55:29.763
Didn't he once also throw a
woman down a flight of stairs

929
00:55:29.899 --> 00:55:31.370
who later sued him?

930
00:55:31.506 --> 00:55:32.602
Yes.

931
00:55:32.737 --> 00:55:34.134
Although, it's unclear

932
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:35.772
this private and
personal failing

933
00:55:35.907 --> 00:55:38.540
is at all relevant to his work.

934
00:55:46.243 --> 00:55:48.177
You're late.

935
00:55:49.755 --> 00:55:50.787
Here, give me your stick.

936
00:55:50.922 --> 00:55:52.555
- Thank you.
- I've got it.

937
00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:41.317
Okay. Uh...

938
00:59:42.821 --> 00:59:43.951
<i>Gut, gut.</i>

939
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:49.358
...Christian...

940
00:59:53.434 --> 00:59:54.797
Okay?

941
00:59:54.933 --> 00:59:56.932
Uh, but it's also...

942
00:59:57.068 --> 00:59:58.134
It's like we're hearing it

943
00:59:58.269 --> 01:00:00.770
from a very, very
great distance.

944
01:00:00.906 --> 01:00:06.368
So it's...

945
01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:07.603
Ju... Uh...

946
01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:09.109
Sorry. <i>Ist</i> Harald da?

947
01:00:12.044 --> 01:00:14.051
Harald? I was just
wondering if you might, um,

948
01:00:14.187 --> 01:00:16.748
uh, quickly rig
something up for us?

949
01:00:47.879 --> 01:00:49.745
<i>Gut, gut, gut.</i>

950
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:52.023
Harald?

951
01:00:52.159 --> 01:00:53.757
Uh, we'll want the
same backstage setup

952
01:00:53.893 --> 01:00:54.959
for the live recording.

953
01:00:55.094 --> 01:00:57.095
One, two, one.

954
01:01:24.654 --> 01:01:27.626
Okay? Looks great, but...

955
01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:28.884
...we need to hear it.

956
01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.663
Okay? It's not...

957
01:01:33.325 --> 01:01:34.325
Hey.

958
01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:42.970
<i>Ja?</i>

959
01:01:43.105 --> 01:01:45.441
Okay?

960
01:01:58.793 --> 01:02:00.658
No.

961
01:02:00.794 --> 01:02:02.293
Bah!

962
01:02:03.061 --> 01:02:04.625
It's-it's much too slow.

963
01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:16.905
Okay.

964
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.609
Okay, tutti.

965
01:02:22.247 --> 01:02:24.506
How are things feeling up here?

966
01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:25.741
Fine, yeah.

967
01:02:25.877 --> 01:02:27.352
Yeah, actually great, but, uh,

968
01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:29.683
it's a shame we don't
record this one direct-to-disk.

969
01:02:29.818 --> 01:02:32.719
Oh. It's criminal,
is more like it.

970
01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.359
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

971
01:02:35.494 --> 01:02:37.396
Yeah, sure, but don't
you want WAV files?

972
01:02:37.532 --> 01:02:40.865
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

973
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.199
Uh, what about video?

974
01:02:42.334 --> 01:02:44.101
Yes, yes. Uh,
stage left A camera.

975
01:02:44.237 --> 01:02:45.565
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

976
01:02:45.701 --> 01:02:47.464
Okay. Uh, bye.
You're quite welcome.

977
01:02:49.671 --> 01:02:51.200
- There?
- Yeah.

978
01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:53.171
You want us to come, to
come in stronger there?

979
01:02:53.172 --> 01:02:54.378
- Okay, then yeah.
- Yeah.

980
01:02:54.514 --> 01:02:56.174
Here, 'cause the
reigning dynamic is forte,

981
01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:57.444
which is not good.

982
01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.209
Yeah?

983
01:02:59.345 --> 01:03:02.281
Yeah. Um, just one
small thing, Maestro.

984
01:03:02.417 --> 01:03:05.214
During the scherzo, um,

985
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:08.326
th-th-the clarinet
solo's still a bit too loud.

986
01:03:08.461 --> 01:03:10.393
It should really be an
accompanying figure

987
01:03:10.529 --> 01:03:13.465
- to the first violins.
- Hmm.

988
01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:16.967
But apart from that, I'd say
we're in very good shape.

989
01:03:17.102 --> 01:03:18.837
Thank you, Sebastian.

990
01:03:18.973 --> 01:03:21.207
Thank you.

991
01:03:26.243 --> 01:03:27.812
Accurate assessment?

992
01:03:27.947 --> 01:03:29.647
I don't think so.

993
01:03:29.783 --> 01:03:33.075
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

994
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.980
Sebastian likes
to sit in the stalls,

995
01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:38.680
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

996
01:03:43.295 --> 01:03:45.420
Something a bit more playful.

997
01:03:50.803 --> 01:03:53.037
Oh, and here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

998
01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:54.636
I think it's very powerful.

999
01:03:54.771 --> 01:03:57.100
Yes, it's-it's really
wonderful work, uh, Karl.

1000
01:03:57.236 --> 01:03:58.956
I'm just wondering if
we might try something

1001
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.940
a little less, uh, considered.

1002
01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:06.947
Something simple like this?

1003
01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.782
I'm not sure how you
would want to light it.

1004
01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:13.754
Have Harald dim the
houselights to half.

1005
01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:17.362
Houselights down half, please.

1006
01:04:21.159 --> 01:04:22.696
I mean, we could make it work,

1007
01:04:22.832 --> 01:04:24.626
but we'd have to
bring in some lights.

1008
01:04:29.542 --> 01:04:31.242
If we want to do
something like this,

1009
01:04:31.377 --> 01:04:33.378
uh, we'll have to
bring the hot lights

1010
01:04:33.514 --> 01:04:35.477
next week, Tanya--
Forget about the strobes.

1011
01:04:38.648 --> 01:04:40.049
Thank you for waiting.

1012
01:04:40.185 --> 01:04:41.649
Of course, Maestro.

1013
01:04:41.785 --> 01:04:44.719
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

1014
01:04:44.854 --> 01:04:48.651
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

1015
01:04:48.787 --> 01:04:50.762
is, uh, a bit loud.

1016
01:04:50.898 --> 01:04:51.995
It's possible.

1017
01:04:52.131 --> 01:04:53.863
Hmm. I don't agree.

1018
01:04:53.999 --> 01:04:57.165
Your dynamic marking is
higher than that of the first violin.

1019
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.728
Yes, that's true.

1020
01:04:58.863 --> 01:05:00.368
Look.

1021
01:05:00.504 --> 01:05:04.107
Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

1022
01:05:04.242 --> 01:05:05.872
I'm rotating him out.

1023
01:05:06.872 --> 01:05:08.908
You're the first to know.

1024
01:05:11.983 --> 01:05:14.353
Well...

1025
01:05:15.986 --> 01:05:19.220
Then I will organize a
caucus, and we'll take a vote.

1026
01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:22.224
No. No, you won't.

1027
01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:24.692
A vote must be taken.

1028
01:05:24.828 --> 01:05:26.861
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1029
01:05:26.996 --> 01:05:29.131
But the appointment of
the assistant conductor

1030
01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:31.860
is entirely my decision.

1031
01:05:33.565 --> 01:05:34.736
Yes.

1032
01:05:34.872 --> 01:05:37.942
So, I can count on your
support with the others?

1033
01:05:40.011 --> 01:05:41.141
Yes.

1034
01:05:41.276 --> 01:05:42.542
Good.

1035
01:05:42.678 --> 01:05:43.906
Who will you replace him with?

1036
01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:45.748
Oh. I'm considering a few names,

1037
01:05:45.884 --> 01:05:49.054
but the main thing is we
proceed with this immediately.

1038
01:05:49.189 --> 01:05:51.380
I understand.

1039
01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.589
Maestro, uh, the other
players would like to know

1040
01:05:53.725 --> 01:05:55.245
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

1041
01:05:55.357 --> 01:05:57.363
<i>Ach!</i>

1042
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.265
Soon, Knut, I promise.

1043
01:05:59.266 --> 01:06:01.030
- Okay. <i>Danke.</i>
- Soon, Knut, I promise.

1044
01:06:29.053 --> 01:06:31.125

- It's okay.

1047
01:07:07.531 --> 01:07:09.798
Uh, I'm sorry, I knocked.

1048
01:07:11.135 --> 01:07:14.070
I knew you wanted your keys
back as quickly as possible.

1049
01:07:14.205 --> 01:07:15.371
Yes, thanks.

1050
01:07:15.507 --> 01:07:17.138

Yeah.

01:07:18.444 --> 01:07:19.806
We can use it for your, um...

1053
01:07:19.942 --> 01:07:21.975
...your taxi home.

1054
01:07:26.285 --> 01:07:27.985
Yeah. It's all right.

1055
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.016
You can go.

1056
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.691
Uh, it wasn't just the keys.

1057
01:07:37.396 --> 01:07:40.499
I-I need someone to hold me.

1058
01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:44.965
This isn't the place, Francesca.

1059
01:07:46.464 --> 01:07:48.698
You're... That's not about...

1060
01:07:50.076 --> 01:07:51.874
I just...

1061
01:07:52.009 --> 01:07:55.481
I just got this from
someone over at Accordion.

1062
01:08:07.323 --> 01:08:08.688
Oh, no.

1063
01:08:11.322 --> 01:08:13.065
When did this happen?

1064
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.160
Day before yesterday.

1065
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:20.203
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

1066
01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:23.202
Delete it. And the rest.

1067
01:08:23.337 --> 01:08:26.611
There's no reason to get
caught up in any intrigue.

1068
01:08:31.843 --> 01:08:33.585
Now, now.

1069
01:08:34.987 --> 01:08:39.916
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

1070
01:08:40.051 --> 01:08:42.390
She wasn't one of us.

1071
01:08:57.878 --> 01:09:01.409
I can't stop thinking about
our trip up the Ucayali.

1072
01:09:02.979 --> 01:09:04.914
- The three of us were so close.
- Yes.

1073
01:09:05.049 --> 01:09:08.554
But that was before she
started making demands.

1074
01:09:10.219 --> 01:09:15.126
There was just something
not quite right about her.

1075
01:09:15.262 --> 01:09:17.862
She had so much promise.

1076
01:09:17.998 --> 01:09:19.655
She did.

1077
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:21.463
Yes.

1078
01:09:21.598 --> 01:09:23.932
Almost as much as you.

1079
01:09:27.905 --> 01:09:31.170
Now, we have to
forget about her.

1080
01:09:34.741 --> 01:09:36.747
You understand?

1081
01:09:41.619 --> 01:09:43.754
Right?

1082
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.522
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1083
01:09:47.657 --> 01:09:49.117
I know you're working.

1084
01:09:50.659 --> 01:09:51.958
Your...

1085
01:09:52.093 --> 01:09:55.029
Your keys are on
the kitchen table.

1086
01:10:59.326 --> 01:11:01.198
She went straight to sleep.

1087
01:11:03.869 --> 01:11:06.265
Didn't even have
to hold her foot.

1088
01:11:10.943 --> 01:11:14.211
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1089
01:11:14.347 --> 01:11:16.081
Oh, attagirl.

1090
01:11:25.723 --> 01:11:27.588
Met the new cellist today.

1091
01:11:27.724 --> 01:11:30.293
Oh, what was that like?

1092
01:11:30.429 --> 01:11:32.590
Olga Metkina.

1093
01:11:32.726 --> 01:11:34.396
Russian.

1094
01:11:34.532 --> 01:11:36.430
Strong player.

1095
01:11:36.565 --> 01:11:38.735
Good.

1096
01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:41.900
Her facial posture
is a bit much.

1097
01:11:42.036 --> 01:11:43.405
How so?

1098
01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.974
Her legato.

1099
01:11:45.109 --> 01:11:47.442
Looks like she's on
the verge of climaxing.

1100
01:11:51.879 --> 01:11:54.143
She is young.

1101
01:11:54.278 --> 01:11:56.051
Ah, so you've met her.

1102
01:11:58.048 --> 01:11:59.580
No, no.

1103
01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:01.957
Uh, Francesca
mentioned something.

1104
01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:04.928
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1105
01:12:07.161 --> 01:12:09.830
You may want
to hold off on that.

1106
01:12:09.966 --> 01:12:12.903
Her invitation is conditional.

1107
01:12:15.805 --> 01:12:18.372
You have reservations?

1108
01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:20.343
No.

1109
01:12:20.478 --> 01:12:22.810
Not really.

1110
01:12:22.946 --> 01:12:25.751
We need to see if she fits in.

1111
01:12:29.456 --> 01:12:31.757
Did you take your pill?

1112
01:12:32.588 --> 01:12:34.954
No.

1113
01:12:35.089 --> 01:12:38.093
Thank you for reminding me.

1114
01:14:05.443 --> 01:14:07.616
How was Johanna yesterday?

1115
01:14:07.752 --> 01:14:10.379
She stays away now.

1116
01:14:10.514 --> 01:14:12.583
You let me know if that changes.

1117
01:14:15.856 --> 01:14:19.557
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1118
01:14:20.692 --> 01:14:22.231
- No, Lydia.
- Because you do know

1119
01:14:22.366 --> 01:14:24.564
you're not supposed to
be in there without me.

1120
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.234
I know.

1121
01:14:28.071 --> 01:14:30.040
That's right.

1122
01:15:03.343 --> 01:15:05.076
S...

1123
01:15:05.912 --> 01:15:07.108
It's not so simple.

1124
01:15:07.244 --> 01:15:08.710
It's got... it's got
to be messier.

1125
01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:14.542
Okay?

1126
01:15:23.124 --> 01:15:25.628
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1127
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:29.899
Okay?

1128
01:15:30.034 --> 01:15:31.632
S-So familiar to everyone here.

1129
01:15:31.768 --> 01:15:34.940
It really doesn't help you to
know this piece so well. Okay.

1130
01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:37.976
Same place.

1131
01:16:06.868 --> 01:16:08.268
Please.

1132
01:16:08.404 --> 01:16:10.672
Please, please, please.

1133
01:16:10.807 --> 01:16:13.011
You must watch.

1134
01:16:17.307 --> 01:16:18.780
Okay?

1135
01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:20.115
It's got to be like, uh,

1136
01:16:20.251 --> 01:16:23.681
just one person
singing their heart out.

1137
01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:28.284
And...

1138
01:16:33.994 --> 01:16:35.524
Okay.

1139
01:16:44.006 --> 01:16:45.538
Okay.

1140
01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:50.415
Maestro.

1141
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:51.610
What a surprise.

1142
01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:53.542
- I was just having a spot of lunch.
- Hmm.

1143
01:16:53.677 --> 01:16:54.886
C-Can I offer you anything?

1144
01:16:55.022 --> 01:16:56.551
Uh, no, thank you.

1145
01:16:56.687 --> 01:16:59.389
- Mm, well, some tea, perhaps?
- No, thank you, Sebastian.

1146
01:17:00.392 --> 01:17:03.088
You know, I forget
sometimes just how impressive

1147
01:17:03.224 --> 01:17:04.925
your collection is here.

1148
01:17:05.061 --> 01:17:07.126
Is that Kalinnikov?

1149
01:17:07.262 --> 01:17:08.731
Yes.

1150
01:17:08.867 --> 01:17:10.835
Isn't he marvelous?

1151
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:14.004
He belongs in a museum.

1152
01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:16.469
I rescued him for
a hundred rubles

1153
01:17:16.605 --> 01:17:19.008
- from a Kyiv street fair back in '90.
- Huh.

1154
01:17:19.143 --> 01:17:21.002
Right after the Wall came down.

1155
01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:23.312
That must really
have been something.

1156
01:17:23.447 --> 01:17:26.446
- Oh, incredible to have lived through it.
- Hmm.

1157
01:17:26.582 --> 01:17:29.010
I'd only just arrived
here with Andris,

1158
01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:32.456
and suddenly the
impossible was possible.

1159
01:17:32.591 --> 01:17:34.158
Yeah.

1160
01:17:35.389 --> 01:17:37.852
I'd like to talk about that.

1161
01:17:37.988 --> 01:17:39.763
- The reunification?
- Uh, no, no.

1162
01:17:39.898 --> 01:17:41.865
But please, sit down.

1163
01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:45.102
No, uh, about the possibility

1164
01:17:45.238 --> 01:17:48.764
of you fronting a
subscription orchestra.

1165
01:17:48.899 --> 01:17:50.038
But I already do.

1166
01:17:50.174 --> 01:17:52.803
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1167
01:17:54.147 --> 01:17:57.478
If not now, then
when, Sebastian?

1168
01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:00.312
You mean leave Berlin?

1169
01:18:00.447 --> 01:18:03.621
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1170
01:18:03.757 --> 01:18:05.856
But this is my home.

1171
01:18:05.991 --> 01:18:09.057
Our only home is the podium.

1172
01:18:09.193 --> 01:18:11.620
We all live out of a suitcase.

1173
01:18:11.755 --> 01:18:13.758
You know that as well as anyone.

1174
01:18:19.938 --> 01:18:22.640
Just think about it.

1175
01:18:22.776 --> 01:18:25.066
Take your time. Mm?

1176
01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:28.278
It's not something we
need to decide now.

1177
01:18:31.015 --> 01:18:32.640
It's the girl, isn't it?

1178
01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:34.179
I'm sorry, what girl?

1179
01:18:34.315 --> 01:18:36.719
Y-You're not asking.

1180
01:18:36.854 --> 01:18:38.555
You're telling.

1181
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:43.194
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1182
01:18:43.329 --> 01:18:45.893
Andris told me
not to worry, but...

1183
01:18:46.028 --> 01:18:47.529
...I knew.

1184
01:18:47.664 --> 01:18:51.360
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1185
01:18:51.495 --> 01:18:52.531
Oh, please.

1186
01:18:52.667 --> 01:18:54.772
Just because nobody
dares breathe it.

1187
01:18:54.908 --> 01:18:56.907
We know the things you do.

1188
01:18:57.042 --> 01:18:59.873
The little favors you grant.

1189
01:19:00.008 --> 01:19:01.344
I'm...

1190
01:19:01.479 --> 01:19:04.705
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1191
01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:07.075
I mean, you of all people

1192
01:19:07.211 --> 01:19:09.251
have the temerity to
question my integrity?

1193
01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:10.847
No, no. I-I'm-I'm
sorry, Maestro.

1194
01:19:10.983 --> 01:19:12.522
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1195
01:19:12.658 --> 01:19:15.216
No, no, no, it's clear you
know exactly what you're saying.

1196
01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:17.358
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1197
01:19:17.494 --> 01:19:19.226
then wouldn't you
say that staying is

1198
01:19:19.362 --> 01:19:20.527
entirely out of the question?

1199
01:19:20.663 --> 01:19:22.623
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1200
01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.192
For what?

1201
01:19:24.328 --> 01:19:27.566
Your obsequiousness, your
hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1202
01:19:27.702 --> 01:19:30.808
- I'm not a misogynist!
- Misogamy.

1203
01:19:30.944 --> 01:19:33.343
It's a hatred of marriage.

1204
01:19:35.005 --> 01:19:37.877
Andris is still very
much married.

1205
01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:43.880
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1206
01:19:44.016 --> 01:19:47.415
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1207
01:19:48.285 --> 01:19:51.385
It could lead to more
than Chinese whispers.

1208
01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:52.997
I know.

1209
01:19:53.132 --> 01:19:54.494
We barely survived <i>Der Spiegel</i>

1210
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:56.894
when you and I
came out together.

1211
01:19:58.471 --> 01:20:02.735
But with Francesca, no
one could point their finger.

1212
01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:05.237
It's not like you two
are in a relationship.

1213
01:20:05.372 --> 01:20:06.837
Yeah, that's true.

1214
01:20:06.972 --> 01:20:09.170
I just... Turns my
stomach to think

1215
01:20:09.306 --> 01:20:11.909
the old robot will be
right about something.

1216
01:20:13.552 --> 01:20:17.453
He's probably
already run to Andris.

1217
01:20:17.588 --> 01:20:21.024
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1218
01:20:21.159 --> 01:20:23.426
you feel is more qualified?

1219
01:20:26.232 --> 01:20:28.728
There are others
equal to the task.

1220
01:20:33.401 --> 01:20:35.669
Maybe wait to decide.

1221
01:20:44.918 --> 01:20:46.551
Where are we at with DG?

1222
01:20:46.686 --> 01:20:50.211
- Uh, I spoke to an assistant in Boyd Muir's office...
- Hmm.

1223
01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.817
...who said they weren't
sure why they decided

1224
01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:56.622
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1225
01:20:56.758 --> 01:20:58.492
But I do know they just did

1226
01:20:58.628 --> 01:21:00.160
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1227
01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:01.966
Of course they did.

1228
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:04.198
The Chinese market's incredible.

1229
01:21:04.333 --> 01:21:06.201
All right. Gloves off.

1230
01:21:06.337 --> 01:21:07.796
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1231
01:21:07.931 --> 01:21:09.211
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1232
01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:10.906
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1233
01:21:12.643 --> 01:21:14.134
You've got his
contact details, right?

1234
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.447
I'll send it to you right now.

1235
01:21:18.516 --> 01:21:22.514
My machine's misbehaving again.

1236
01:21:22.649 --> 01:21:24.483
I've already spoken to I.T.

1237
01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:26.885
Just here-- let me borrow yours.

1238
01:21:34.031 --> 01:21:35.828
Thank you.

1239
01:21:38.972 --> 01:21:40.701
Where's the matcha?

1240
01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.115
Ah, I wasn't sure
where you were.

1241
01:22:27.251 --> 01:22:28.881
Was working out a kink.

1242
01:22:29.016 --> 01:22:31.320
The-the matcha's
cold. I-I'll get another.

1243
01:22:31.456 --> 01:22:32.747
It's all right. I don't need it.

1244
01:22:32.883 --> 01:22:34.953
Let's just keep working.

1245
01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:44.392
Francesca, you did as I asked

1246
01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:48.067
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1247
01:22:48.203 --> 01:22:49.869
correct?

1248
01:22:51.472 --> 01:22:54.577
Um, I'm not sure.

1249
01:22:55.544 --> 01:22:57.145
Uh, I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

1250
01:22:57.281 --> 01:22:59.582
I-I'll double-check.

1251
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:09.456
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1252
01:23:09.591 --> 01:23:11.252
and I wondered if you might, uh,

1253
01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:15.400
compile a list of
suitable replacements.

1254
01:23:19.968 --> 01:23:23.408
Uh, of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1255
01:23:26.446 --> 01:23:28.809
Thank you.

1256
01:23:30.077 --> 01:23:33.948
Oh, your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1257
01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:36.618
Meant to have
you reschedule that

1258
01:23:36.619 --> 01:23:38.285
'til after the orchestra votes.

1259
01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.524
I'll text her now.

1260
01:23:42.292 --> 01:23:44.394
No, wait.

1261
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:47.227
Might as well see
what she's made of.

1262
01:23:55.636 --> 01:23:57.871
This food.

1263
01:23:59.479 --> 01:24:03.504
The cucumber
salad's, uh, very good.

1264
01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.511
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1265
01:24:05.646 --> 01:24:07.149
if you're vegetarian.

1266
01:24:07.285 --> 01:24:08.985
Uh, do you eat fish?

1267
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.950
Not really.

1268
01:24:13.625 --> 01:24:16.984
You know, we can
go somewhere else.

1269
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:18.653
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1270
01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:22.156
I mean, it's... uh, it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1271
01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.225
that new members
are brought here

1272
01:24:24.361 --> 01:24:27.166
to sup with the
ghosts of the past.

1273
01:24:27.301 --> 01:24:30.202
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1274
01:24:30.338 --> 01:24:34.243
to Beethoven tucked in for a
meal at one of these tables.

1275
01:24:34.378 --> 01:24:36.574
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1276
01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:38.272
I wonder which one.

1277
01:24:38.408 --> 01:24:41.117
Who's that? It's
a, uh, musician?

1278
01:24:41.253 --> 01:24:42.917
No. She helped found

1279
01:24:43.052 --> 01:24:45.917
Social Democratic women's
movement in Germany

1280
01:24:46.053 --> 01:24:49.393
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1281
01:24:49.528 --> 01:24:52.226
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1282
01:24:52.362 --> 01:24:53.720
Clara Zetkin?

1283
01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:55.061
Yes.

1284
01:24:55.196 --> 01:24:57.531
Every March 8th, we
place flowers at her plaque

1285
01:24:57.666 --> 01:25:00.201
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1286
01:25:00.337 --> 01:25:01.634
Her birthday?

1287
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:03.974
No, International Women's Day.

1288
01:25:07.404 --> 01:25:09.778
Are you ready, Maestro?

1289
01:25:09.914 --> 01:25:14.244
- Yes, uh...
- Yes, first shashlik, then veal.

1290
01:25:15.278 --> 01:25:17.585
- For you?
- Cucumber salad.

1291
01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.084
- Thank you.
- Good choice.

1292
01:25:22.358 --> 01:25:24.289
Some more bread?

1293
01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:33.067
It's good. Would
you like a bite?

1294
01:25:33.203 --> 01:25:34.928
Oh, no.

1295
01:25:35.064 --> 01:25:36.871
No. Thank you.

1296
01:25:37.872 --> 01:25:39.570
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1297
01:25:39.705 --> 01:25:41.476
No, not at all.

1298
01:25:41.611 --> 01:25:43.009
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1299
01:25:43.144 --> 01:25:45.748
- until I know decision of orchestra.
- Hmm.

1300
01:25:46.650 --> 01:25:48.418
Simonov will hold your place?

1301
01:25:48.554 --> 01:25:51.556
Yes, I think so. He is my uncle.

1302
01:25:54.222 --> 01:25:56.917
But my dream has always
been to play with Berlin.

1303
01:25:57.052 --> 01:25:58.953
Oh, me, too.

1304
01:25:59.089 --> 01:26:01.159
There's nowhere like it.

1305
01:26:04.837 --> 01:26:08.573
I imagine, uh, Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1306
01:26:09.574 --> 01:26:11.673
Well, of course, he was great.

1307
01:26:11.809 --> 01:26:13.843
We study him at
Moscow Conservatory,

1308
01:26:13.979 --> 01:26:18.140
but growing up, my
favorite is Jacqueline du Pré.

1309
01:26:18.275 --> 01:26:20.678
She made me want to play cello.

1310
01:26:20.814 --> 01:26:22.218
Which record was it?

1311
01:26:22.354 --> 01:26:24.945
Not record. YouTube.

1312
01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.921
Elgar Concerto.

1313
01:26:28.656 --> 01:26:29.858
Oh, of course.

1314
01:26:29.993 --> 01:26:32.560
With Barenboim
conducting the London Phil.

1315
01:26:32.695 --> 01:26:35.497
I don't know who was conducting.

1316
01:26:35.632 --> 01:26:38.458
But she did something to me.

1317
01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:40.295
That's when I
decide to learn piece

1318
01:26:40.431 --> 01:26:42.803
and play it with
youth orchestra.

1319
01:26:42.939 --> 01:26:44.899
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1320
01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:46.776
Thirteen.

1321
01:26:48.179 --> 01:26:49.641
Wow.

1322
01:26:49.777 --> 01:26:51.582
I'd love to hear it.

1323
01:26:51.717 --> 01:26:54.619
They make video.
I will text to you.

1324
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.320
My mother's newspaper delivery...

1325
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.980
...it's missing. Do you have it?

1326
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.360
No.

1327
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.780
Are you sure?

1328
01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:11.570
No, I'm sorry.

1329
01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:04.402
Beautiful.

1330
01:30:14.148 --> 01:30:17.015
Now, um, just before we break,

1331
01:30:17.150 --> 01:30:19.084
I know many of you are wondering

1332
01:30:19.219 --> 01:30:22.090
what the companion
piece will be.

1333
01:30:22.225 --> 01:30:24.719
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1334
01:30:24.854 --> 01:30:26.688
and was wondering
if we could just take

1335
01:30:26.824 --> 01:30:30.358
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1336
01:30:30.493 --> 01:30:33.365
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1337
01:30:59.361 --> 01:31:03.832
Oh, and, uh, given what
we've all been through,

1338
01:31:03.967 --> 01:31:05.563
what we're still going through,

1339
01:31:05.699 --> 01:31:10.237
and we're finally back
together as a family, I-I...

1340
01:31:11.404 --> 01:31:13.305
...I feel that maybe the soloist

1341
01:31:13.441 --> 01:31:16.076
should come from
within our own ranks.

1342
01:31:16.211 --> 01:31:17.479
Yeah.

1343
01:31:19.048 --> 01:31:20.346
Good. Okay, good.

1344
01:31:20.482 --> 01:31:23.150
Just... Sorry. One
more question.

1345
01:31:23.286 --> 01:31:25.455
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1346
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:27.089
I mean...

1347
01:31:27.225 --> 01:31:29.823
...as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1348
01:31:29.958 --> 01:31:31.987
normally fall to you.

1349
01:31:32.123 --> 01:31:34.765
But given how much is gonna
be asked of you with the Mahler,

1350
01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:36.633
I-I wondered if you'd
be at all bothered

1351
01:31:36.769 --> 01:31:39.398
if we were to hold auditions?

1352
01:31:48.179 --> 01:31:51.641
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1353
01:31:54.745 --> 01:31:57.711
But, in theory, I
have no objection.

1354
01:31:57.847 --> 01:31:59.186
My only hesitation
will depend on

1355
01:31:59.322 --> 01:32:00.802
when these auditions
might take place.

1356
01:32:00.925 --> 01:32:02.287
I wouldn't want them in any way

1357
01:32:02.422 --> 01:32:03.702
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1358
01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.457
No, no, no. That's a good point.

1359
01:32:05.592 --> 01:32:07.126
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a...

1360
01:32:07.261 --> 01:32:08.661
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1361
01:32:08.796 --> 01:32:10.429
Um...

1362
01:32:11.867 --> 01:32:13.630
How about Monday?

1363
01:32:17.674 --> 01:32:19.339
All right.

1364
01:32:22.605 --> 01:32:23.838
Okay, good.

1365
01:32:23.973 --> 01:32:26.977
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1366
01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:29.750
And remember,

1367
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.500
All section members are invited.

1368
01:32:41.967 --> 01:32:44.160
Let me see what she says.

1369
01:32:44.296 --> 01:32:46.201
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1370
01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:49.163
Britta, hi.

1371
01:32:49.298 --> 01:32:50.298
Lydia.

1372
01:32:50.304 --> 01:32:51.999
Just caught the end.

1373
01:32:52.134 --> 01:32:54.041
What'd you think? How's
it, uh, how's it sounding?

1374
01:32:54.042 --> 01:32:56.210
Oh, it's fantastic.

1375
01:32:56.346 --> 01:32:58.539
I can't wait until
the live recording.

1376
01:32:58.675 --> 01:33:00.211
Yes, well.

1377
01:33:00.347 --> 01:33:02.784
I'll be happy when it's over.

1378
01:33:02.919 --> 01:33:04.551
It's always that way.

1379
01:33:04.687 --> 01:33:07.885
I know you're busy, and I
don't want to add to your load,

1380
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.955
but...

1381
01:33:10.091 --> 01:33:12.193
Andris Davis called.

1382
01:33:12.328 --> 01:33:15.532
Look, he's upset I'm
rotating Sebastian.

1383
01:33:15.668 --> 01:33:16.862
No, no, no, no, no.

1384
01:33:16.997 --> 01:33:18.198
Something else.

1385
01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:19.653
But you will please
let Laura know

1386
01:33:19.699 --> 01:33:21.104
as soon as you have
chosen his replacement

1387
01:33:21.105 --> 01:33:22.465
so she can prepare
a press release.

1388
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:23.771
Yeah, of course.

1389
01:33:23.907 --> 01:33:25.571
Uh, so what did he want?

1390
01:33:25.706 --> 01:33:28.035
To complain about the
punctuality of a driver

1391
01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.945
he seems to believe the
board supplies him with.

1392
01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.107
Do you know anything about this?

1393
01:33:33.243 --> 01:33:34.415
Yes.

1394
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:37.415
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1395
01:33:37.551 --> 01:33:40.120
Then why does he
believe it's the board?

1396
01:33:40.255 --> 01:33:43.483
Because he needs
to believe that.

1397
01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.294
H-He needs to b...

1398
01:33:45.429 --> 01:33:47.889
needs to believe he
hasn't been forgotten, Britta.

1399
01:33:48.024 --> 01:33:50.597
Uh, the academy has
von Karajan's name on it,

1400
01:33:50.733 --> 01:33:53.226
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1401
01:33:53.362 --> 01:33:57.639
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1402
01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:59.265
All right.

1403
01:33:59.401 --> 01:34:02.776
Then perhaps Francesca
could have a word with the driver.

1404
01:34:02.911 --> 01:34:05.075
Of course.

1405
01:34:05.210 --> 01:34:07.077
One other thing.

1406
01:34:07.212 --> 01:34:08.914
It's unpleasant.

1407
01:34:09.049 --> 01:34:10.445
Oh, is it?

1408
01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.353
Operational shortfall?

1409
01:34:12.488 --> 01:34:14.950
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1410
01:34:15.085 --> 01:34:16.951
No, no, no, nothing to
do with the orchestra.

1411
01:34:17.086 --> 01:34:19.123
Do you remember an
Accordion Academy fellow

1412
01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:21.758
named Krista Taylor?

1413
01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.970
Yes. Why?

1414
01:34:27.106 --> 01:34:29.606
Apparently, she
committed suicide.

1415
01:34:29.742 --> 01:34:32.774
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1416
01:34:32.909 --> 01:34:34.839
Her parents mu...

1417
01:34:35.775 --> 01:34:38.377
Wait, sorry, I'm...
I'm confused, Britta.

1418
01:34:38.513 --> 01:34:40.784
Why, why were you
put in the position

1419
01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.120
to deliver this terrible news?

1420
01:34:42.254 --> 01:34:44.182
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1421
01:34:44.317 --> 01:34:46.187
It's delicate, Lydia.

1422
01:34:46.322 --> 01:34:47.790
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1423
01:34:47.926 --> 01:34:49.192
if you contacted a lawyer

1424
01:34:49.327 --> 01:34:51.789
before speaking with
anyone at Accordion.

1425
01:34:51.925 --> 01:34:55.297
Well, presumably, that
anyone includes Eliot himself.

1426
01:34:57.303 --> 01:35:00.533
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1427
01:35:00.668 --> 01:35:05.109
Apparently, some
accusations have been made.

1428
01:35:06.674 --> 01:35:08.644
Accusations? What
kind of accusations?

1429
01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.246
He didn't say.

1430
01:35:10.381 --> 01:35:12.645
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1431
01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:15.709
Mr. Kaplan said he's
certain nothing will come of it,

1432
01:35:15.845 --> 01:35:18.452
but one can't be too careful.

1433
01:35:36.969 --> 01:35:39.407
I'm sorry about the
hour. It's Lydia Tár calling.

1434
01:35:39.542 --> 01:35:42.676
I need to speak to
Mr. Singer immediately.

1435
01:35:42.812 --> 01:35:44.076
Yes.

1436
01:35:44.211 --> 01:35:46.183
Yes, it's urgent.

1437
01:36:15.174 --> 01:36:17.214
Tired?

1438
01:36:20.246 --> 01:36:22.715
Sleep's elusive.

1439
01:36:23.618 --> 01:36:26.190
I was the same
before a recording date.

1440
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:29.556
Lydia...

1441
01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:33.290
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1442
01:36:35.892 --> 01:36:38.593
Who will you replace him with?

1443
01:36:38.728 --> 01:36:40.965
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1444
01:36:41.868 --> 01:36:45.136
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1445
01:36:45.272 --> 01:36:47.739
Not the girl?

1446
01:36:56.546 --> 01:36:58.651
Andris...

1447
01:37:01.885 --> 01:37:04.588
...have you ever had an issue

1448
01:37:04.723 --> 01:37:07.288
with a, a student or colleague,

1449
01:37:07.424 --> 01:37:09.565
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1450
01:37:09.566 --> 01:37:11.046
Has someone been
complaining about me?

1451
01:37:11.096 --> 01:37:13.169
- No, no, no, of course not.
- Because at this point,

1452
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:14.602
they've missed their chance.

1453
01:37:14.737 --> 01:37:16.805
- I'm out of the game.
- Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1454
01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.198
Course you are.

1455
01:37:18.333 --> 01:37:20.139
Thank God I was never
pulled from the podium

1456
01:37:20.274 --> 01:37:22.211
like Jimmy Levine.

1457
01:37:22.347 --> 01:37:26.105
Or-or hunted like
Charles Dutoit.

1458
01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:28.649
I take it you're
asking for a reason.

1459
01:37:28.785 --> 01:37:31.645
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1460
01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:33.315
in the news lately.

1461
01:37:33.450 --> 01:37:36.756
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1462
01:37:37.692 --> 01:37:39.219
But I suppose that
was also the case

1463
01:37:39.354 --> 01:37:42.326
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1464
01:37:42.462 --> 01:37:45.599
A bit with Karajan, too.

1465
01:37:48.206 --> 01:37:50.870
Who was the better conductor?

1466
01:37:51.706 --> 01:37:54.169
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1467
01:37:54.304 --> 01:37:56.540
Yeah, when I first arrived
here, the older members

1468
01:37:56.676 --> 01:37:59.846
had, uh, hmm, hushed opinions.

1469
01:37:59.982 --> 01:38:03.313
At the same time, they
wanted to leave that era behind.

1470
01:38:03.449 --> 01:38:04.844
What, the war?

1471
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.151
No, postwar.

1472
01:38:06.286 --> 01:38:08.420
Denazification.

1473
01:38:08.555 --> 01:38:10.159
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1474
01:38:10.294 --> 01:38:12.228
process started all over again.

1475
01:38:12.364 --> 01:38:14.931
Furtwängler never
joined the Party.

1476
01:38:15.067 --> 01:38:16.332
Refused to give the salute

1477
01:38:16.468 --> 01:38:18.498
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1478
01:38:18.634 --> 01:38:21.334
Or to sign his
letters, "Heil, Hitler."

1479
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:24.372
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1480
01:38:24.508 --> 01:38:29.046
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1481
01:38:29.181 --> 01:38:31.847
Until then, he was semiretired,

1482
01:38:31.982 --> 01:38:34.516
playing corpses.

1483
01:38:35.315 --> 01:38:37.352
Playing corpses?

1484
01:38:37.488 --> 01:38:40.819
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1485
01:38:42.351 --> 01:38:44.522
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1486
01:38:44.657 --> 01:38:46.924
with being an accused Nazi?

1487
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:49.532
Either way, you had to be ready.

1488
01:38:49.668 --> 01:38:52.300
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1489
01:38:52.435 --> 01:38:54.668
were facing the same direction.

1490
01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:08.077
How many are
auditioning on Monday?

1491
01:39:12.351 --> 01:39:13.885
No one.

1492
01:39:14.859 --> 01:39:16.525
No one?

1493
01:39:18.029 --> 01:39:20.395
Maybe Martin.

1494
01:39:20.531 --> 01:39:22.256
He's never gotten
along with Gosia.

1495
01:39:22.391 --> 01:39:25.028
He would love to sit
downstage for once.

1496
01:39:26.695 --> 01:39:29.096
Well...

1497
01:39:29.232 --> 01:39:31.540
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1498
01:39:33.274 --> 01:39:35.176
Of course.

1499
01:39:35.312 --> 01:39:37.546
Have to follow the rules.

1500
01:39:39.376 --> 01:39:41.749
Aren't we being a
bit formal, Francesca?

1501
01:39:41.884 --> 01:39:44.420
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1502
01:39:44.556 --> 01:39:47.457
No, Maestro, there are two.

1503
01:40:49.651 --> 01:40:51.519
Well, it's unanimous.

1504
01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:54.222
- Number two.
- Mm-hmm.

1505
01:40:54.357 --> 01:40:55.655
And we have a problem.

1506
01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:57.151
She's not officially
been invited

1507
01:40:57.287 --> 01:40:59.463
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1508
01:41:00.632 --> 01:41:03.929
Well, she wouldn't
need to be to solo for us.

1509
01:41:04.064 --> 01:41:06.167
I believe the criteria
of the audition

1510
01:41:06.303 --> 01:41:08.695
was all section members?

1511
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:11.035
Then her audition gets thrown out.
- No.

1512
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:13.539
Francesca, please ask
Martin to come back in

1513
01:41:13.674 --> 01:41:15.869
so we can give him the news.

1514
01:41:16.005 --> 01:41:18.009
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1515
01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:22.843
Shit!

1516
01:41:24.183 --> 01:41:26.589
Yeah!

1517
01:41:27.923 --> 01:41:31.290
I'll confirm solo
rehearsal dates with her.

1518
01:41:31.425 --> 01:41:33.259
Thank you.

1519
01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:35.598
Have a seat.

1520
01:41:39.833 --> 01:41:41.767
I have made a decision

1521
01:41:41.903 --> 01:41:44.706
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1522
01:41:45.843 --> 01:41:49.579
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1523
01:41:50.914 --> 01:41:55.246
Uh, this position brings with
it enormous responsibility,

1524
01:41:55.381 --> 01:41:58.711
and my personal affection for you aside...
-

1525
01:41:58.847 --> 01:42:03.725
...I will have to go with someone
more, more experienced.

1526
01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:05.451
Oh, leave me alone.

1527
01:43:05.587 --> 01:43:07.954
I don't have your paper.

1528
01:43:08.822 --> 01:43:10.656
I've told you before, I...

1529
01:43:10.792 --> 01:43:12.992
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1530
01:43:59.001 --> 01:44:00.205
Good. Good.

1531
01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:03.270
I-I think the contrast
is, it's much better now.

1532
01:44:03.405 --> 01:44:04.778
Don't you think?

1533
01:44:04.914 --> 01:44:06.676
How do you take your coffee?

1534
01:44:06.812 --> 01:44:09.048
Black. Strong.

1535
01:44:10.685 --> 01:44:12.512
Is all right if I play?

1536
01:44:12.647 --> 01:44:15.153
Hmm? Oh, yes, of
course, of course.

1537
01:45:03.641 --> 01:45:06.098
That's as far as I've gotten.

1538
01:45:06.234 --> 01:45:08.244
But it's good.

1539
01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:10.945
Um, this part here.

1540
01:45:14.717 --> 01:45:17.083
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1541
01:45:20.792 --> 01:45:23.254
That's better. I
like that sound.

1542
01:45:24.891 --> 01:45:27.130
Come on. Take a break.

1543
01:45:27.265 --> 01:45:29.227
Okay.

1544
01:45:41.612 --> 01:45:43.109
<i>Sharon?</i>

1545
01:45:46.415 --> 01:45:48.279
Hello.

1546
01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.170
Sharon is out with her sister.

1547
01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:54.890
From the way they were whispering

1548
01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.890
I'd say that they're up to no good.

1549
01:45:58.220 --> 01:46:00.060
The child is in its room.

1550
01:46:04.092 --> 01:46:05.934
Petra.

1551
01:46:31.695 --> 01:46:33.520
What are you doing in here?

1552
01:46:33.656 --> 01:46:36.564
I'm hiding from her.

1553
01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:38.066
Why?

1554
01:46:38.201 --> 01:46:41.228
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1555
01:46:41.363 --> 01:46:44.203
but they already are.

1556
01:46:46.971 --> 01:46:49.175
I can see that.

1557
01:46:50.171 --> 01:46:51.338
Come on.

1558
01:46:51.473 --> 01:46:53.343
They're all waiting for you.

1559
01:46:53.479 --> 01:46:56.717
I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1560
01:46:56.852 --> 01:46:58.015
All of them?

1561
01:46:58.151 --> 01:46:59.680
They can't all conduct, honey.

1562
01:46:59.815 --> 01:47:03.354
It's not a, it's
not a democracy.

1563
01:48:08.987 --> 01:48:10.591
Okay, uh...

1564
01:48:16.824 --> 01:48:19.460
- Hey, that's good.
- Yeah. Good.

1565
01:48:19.595 --> 01:48:20.701
You happy?

1566
01:48:24.273 --> 01:48:27.109
How long were you
acquainted with Miss Taylor?

1567
01:48:27.244 --> 01:48:31.209
Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1568
01:48:31.344 --> 01:48:34.146
but cumulatively
speaking, I'd say

1569
01:48:34.282 --> 01:48:36.844
not more than a few months.

1570
01:48:36.979 --> 01:48:39.585
- Thank you for your time, Maestro.
- Not at all.

1571
01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:43.116
- This recording will exist on a protected server...
- Mm-hmm.

1572
01:48:43.117 --> 01:48:45.289
...under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1573
01:48:45.425 --> 01:48:47.027
- Great.
- He will follow up with you

1574
01:48:47.163 --> 01:48:49.031
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1575
01:48:52.327 --> 01:48:54.126
Deposition?

1576
01:48:54.262 --> 01:48:55.637
Yes.

1577
01:48:55.773 --> 01:48:57.468
I assumed you were aware.

1578
01:48:57.603 --> 01:48:59.640
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1579
01:48:59.776 --> 01:49:01.673
with your assistant.

1580
01:49:01.808 --> 01:49:04.204
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1581
01:49:04.339 --> 01:49:05.880
right now.

1582
01:49:07.548 --> 01:49:09.551
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1583
01:49:09.552 --> 01:49:11.712
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1584
01:49:11.847 --> 01:49:13.247
tendering her
immediate resignation,

1585
01:49:13.319 --> 01:49:14.990
stating she would be in contact

1586
01:49:15.126 --> 01:49:17.483
when she had more
details to provide.

1587
01:49:17.618 --> 01:49:18.990
What kind of details?

1588
01:49:19.126 --> 01:49:20.558
A new address, I suppose.

1589
01:49:20.693 --> 01:49:22.931
In the meantime, we've
been trying all morning

1590
01:49:23.067 --> 01:49:24.666
to find someone
suitable to assist you

1591
01:49:24.801 --> 01:49:26.002
on a temporary basis.

1592
01:49:26.137 --> 01:49:27.897
For now, perhaps your
new assistant conductor

1593
01:49:27.969 --> 01:49:29.403
would be the right fit.

1594
01:49:29.539 --> 01:49:31.904
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1595
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.142
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1596
01:49:38.148 --> 01:49:39.914
I know how much
you depended on her.

1597
01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:41.408
Two-faced little bitch.

1598
01:49:41.543 --> 01:49:43.009
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1599
01:49:43.145 --> 01:49:45.512
- Don't you dare try to defend her.
- God, slow down!

1600
01:49:45.647 --> 01:49:47.180
She'll come galumphing back.

1601
01:49:47.315 --> 01:49:49.326
- I mean, I've got a dumb phone like every robot.
- Tár, s...

1602
01:49:49.327 --> 01:49:51.391
How hard can it be to text all day?
-

1603
01:49:51.527 --> 01:49:53.924
Slow down!

1604
01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.395
Or let me out!

1605
01:50:17.285 --> 01:50:19.517
Francesca!

1606
01:50:52.553 --> 01:50:55.256
Fräulein?

1607
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:56.560
You're trespassing.

1608
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:44.360
Quickly!

1609
01:51:44.773 --> 01:51:46.004
Come.

1610
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:14.720
We must transfer her.

1611
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:18.520
We must transfer her.

1612
01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.810
...it's going to be
alright, Fräulein.

1613
01:52:21.900 --> 01:52:22.730
Not the hand!

1614
01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.900
Use the strap!

1615
01:53:22.272 --> 01:53:23.904
Sorry I'm late again.

1616
01:53:30.882 --> 01:53:33.573
D-Do you live here?

1617
01:53:33.708 --> 01:53:35.917
Not normally, no.

1618
01:53:36.053 --> 01:53:37.414
Uh, make yourself at home.

1619
01:53:37.549 --> 01:53:38.853
I'm just gonna put something on.

1620
01:53:38.989 --> 01:53:40.454
Do you have a towel?

1621
01:53:42.555 --> 01:53:44.920
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1622
01:53:50.067 --> 01:53:52.796
I got caught in the rain.

1623
01:54:03.943 --> 01:54:06.506
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1624
01:54:06.641 --> 01:54:07.978
You should come.

1625
01:54:09.082 --> 01:54:12.616
Thanks, but I-I...
really must get home.

1626
01:54:12.751 --> 01:54:15.791
You have child, yes?

1627
01:54:15.927 --> 01:54:17.623
I will not do that.

1628
01:54:19.954 --> 01:54:21.759
Pets are better for some people.

1629
01:54:34.636 --> 01:54:35.734
What... Oh.

1630
01:54:35.869 --> 01:54:37.069
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1631
01:54:37.204 --> 01:54:38.308
Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1632
01:54:38.444 --> 01:54:39.806
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

1633
01:54:39.942 --> 01:54:41.779
Okay.

1634
01:54:48.716 --> 01:54:50.483
Oh, Olga!

1635
01:54:50.618 --> 01:54:51.723
Olga!

1636
01:54:59.737 --> 01:55:01.535
Olga?

1637
01:55:08.141 --> 01:55:10.313
Olga?

1638
01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.343
Hello?

1639
01:55:52.053 --> 01:55:53.752
Olga?

1640
01:56:12.370 --> 01:56:14.036
Olga?

1641
01:56:23.216 --> 01:56:24.580
Olga?

1642
01:57:12.126 --> 01:57:14.127
Why didn't you go to the police?

1643
01:57:14.262 --> 01:57:17.099
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1644
01:57:20.768 --> 01:57:21.873
Oh, God.

1645
01:57:22.008 --> 01:57:23.213
I'm gonna get you
something for the pain.

1646
01:57:23.214 --> 01:57:24.254
No, I don't need anything.

1647
01:57:24.281 --> 01:57:26.308
No, I'm gonna get you something.

1648
01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.250
Was someone mean to you?

1649
01:57:32.484 --> 01:57:34.116
<i>Ja.</i>

1650
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:38.800
You're the most beautiful person I know.

1651
01:57:49.637 --> 01:57:52.134
Lydia!

1652
01:57:54.802 --> 01:57:55.802
Lydia!

1653
01:58:01.513 --> 01:58:03.486
What is it?

1654
01:58:05.551 --> 01:58:07.655
Hold my foot.

1655
01:58:15.989 --> 01:58:17.359
Is that better?

1656
01:58:17.495 --> 01:58:19.062
Yes.

1657
01:58:56.540 --> 01:58:57.880
Give me some eyes.

1658
01:59:00.373 --> 01:59:02.072
Okay.

1659
01:59:02.207 --> 01:59:04.877
Let's, uh, shoo the
elephant from the room.

1660
01:59:05.979 --> 01:59:08.650
"What the hell
happened to her face?"

1661
01:59:08.785 --> 01:59:11.083
"Did she, uh, schedule
a nose and eye job

1662
01:59:11.219 --> 01:59:13.847
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1663
01:59:19.062 --> 01:59:20.789
No.

1664
01:59:20.925 --> 01:59:22.459
I was, uh, I was attacked.

1665
01:59:22.594 --> 01:59:24.990
Thank you.

1666
01:59:25.125 --> 01:59:26.966
I'm fine. Really.

1667
01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:28.938
Should've seen the other guy.

1668
01:59:29.073 --> 01:59:30.073
All right.

1669
02:00:15.285 --> 02:00:16.810
Don't.

1670
02:00:16.945 --> 02:00:18.483
It burns.

1671
02:00:18.619 --> 02:00:20.652
You must see the doctor.

1672
02:00:20.787 --> 02:00:22.555
He's booked 'til next week.

1673
02:00:22.691 --> 02:00:23.889
I'll call them again

1674
02:00:24.025 --> 02:00:25.552
and tell them how
much pain you're in.

1675
02:00:25.687 --> 02:00:28.062
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

1676
02:00:28.197 --> 02:00:29.663
Okay?

1677
02:00:29.799 --> 02:00:31.696
Overall, the
balance feels right.

1678
02:00:31.831 --> 02:00:33.063
Other than a quick brushup,

1679
02:00:33.198 --> 02:00:35.599
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

1680
02:00:35.735 --> 02:00:38.403
You're certain of that?

1681
02:00:38.538 --> 02:00:40.842
I think so. Yes.

1682
02:00:40.978 --> 02:00:42.711
<i>We're absolutely
rock-solid there,</i>

1683
02:00:42.846 --> 02:00:47.540
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1684
02:00:47.675 --> 02:00:49.479
Uh, they're just getting
caught up in the power

1685
02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:53.286
of your, uh, glissando in
there, trying to match it.

1686
02:00:53.421 --> 02:00:56.392
Um, probably...

1687
02:00:56.527 --> 02:00:59.018
Where were you
attacked, Maestro?

1688
02:00:59.154 --> 02:01:02.064
Oh, doesn't matter.

1689
02:01:02.199 --> 02:01:03.694
Here.

1690
02:01:03.829 --> 02:01:07.025
Thank you.

1691
02:01:07.161 --> 02:01:08.598
There you are.

1692
02:01:09.501 --> 02:01:11.768
- When did this fall happen?
- Uh, it's all a blur.

1693
02:01:11.903 --> 02:01:14.574
Three, four days ago.

1694
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:16.108
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

1695
02:01:16.243 --> 02:01:19.913
It kind of burns, like I
fell asleep by the pool.

1696
02:01:21.048 --> 02:01:24.210
Okay, you can put
your shirt back on.

1697
02:01:24.345 --> 02:01:25.554
You've damaged some nerves.

1698
02:01:25.690 --> 02:01:27.017
The burning
sensation you're feeling

1699
02:01:27.018 --> 02:01:28.552
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1700
02:01:28.687 --> 02:01:29.785
Nostalgia?

1701
02:01:29.921 --> 02:01:32.122
"Notalgia." No "S."

1702
02:01:32.258 --> 02:01:34.659
- Well, how do we treat it?
- You don't.

1703
02:01:34.795 --> 02:01:36.128
Eventually, it goes away.

1704
02:01:36.264 --> 02:01:39.702
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1705
02:02:28.084 --> 02:02:29.948
Oh, well, then you must be

1706
02:02:30.084 --> 02:02:33.481
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

1707
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:37.788
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

1708
02:02:37.924 --> 02:02:40.158
to a superhot young woman.

1709
02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:43.288
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

1710
02:02:43.424 --> 02:02:45.459
Now, you could masturbate,

1711
02:02:45.595 --> 02:02:49.200
but what are you
actually doing to me?

1712
02:02:54.809 --> 02:02:56.175
- Britta.
- Hi, hi.

1713
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:59.041
- Have you seen it?
- Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1714
02:02:59.177 --> 02:03:02.146
...gathering this afternoon.

1715
02:03:02.281 --> 02:03:04.180
- This afternoon?
- Is that a problem?

1716
02:03:04.316 --> 02:03:06.514
No, just... No, it's no problem.

1717
02:03:40.147 --> 02:03:45.684
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

1718
02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:49.427
And second, whoever
violated that rule

1719
02:03:49.562 --> 02:03:52.798
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

1720
02:03:52.933 --> 02:03:54.398
to completely redefine my words.

1721
02:03:54.534 --> 02:03:56.696
I mean, look at the reverse
shots on the students.

1722
02:03:56.831 --> 02:03:58.538
There's no way that
was done in real time.

1723
02:03:58.674 --> 02:03:59.970
It's a hatchet job.

1724
02:04:00.105 --> 02:04:02.067
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1725
02:04:02.202 --> 02:04:05.881
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

1726
02:04:06.016 --> 02:04:07.680
Unfortunately, it's
linked to an article in

1727
02:04:07.681 --> 02:04:10.082
the <i>New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

1728
02:04:10.217 --> 02:04:12.984
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

1729
02:04:13.119 --> 02:04:14.989
they claim to have interviewed.

1730
02:04:15.125 --> 02:04:17.216
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

1731
02:04:17.352 --> 02:04:18.560
We haven't had any.

1732
02:04:18.696 --> 02:04:20.228
Obviously, we gave no response

1733
02:04:20.363 --> 02:04:22.897
- as we first wanted to meet to discuss strategy.
- Mm-hmm.

1734
02:04:23.033 --> 02:04:25.362
- Here's the article.
- Thank you, Laura.

1735
02:04:29.765 --> 02:04:33.007
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

1736
02:04:33.142 --> 02:04:36.000
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

1737
02:04:36.136 --> 02:04:38.645
Blocked opportunities to
those who didn't comply."

1738
02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:41.080
This is total fiction.

1739
02:04:41.216 --> 02:04:43.508
And the <i>Post</i> is a
how-de-do scandal rag.

1740
02:04:43.643 --> 02:04:46.383
No serious person reads it.

1741
02:04:49.223 --> 02:04:52.922
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

1742
02:04:53.057 --> 02:04:54.419
she was disturbed.

1743
02:04:54.555 --> 02:04:56.529
I mean, she fixated on me.

1744
02:04:56.664 --> 02:04:58.433
In what way?

1745
02:04:58.569 --> 02:04:59.864
She sent me weird gifts.

1746
02:04:59.999 --> 02:05:01.533
She trolled me online.

1747
02:05:01.668 --> 02:05:04.469
- She tried to send me signals.
- Well, what kind of signals?

1748
02:05:04.605 --> 02:05:07.765
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

1749
02:05:07.901 --> 02:05:10.144
I mean, that's easily
checked, right?

1750
02:05:10.279 --> 02:05:13.916
And did you ever report
this or file a complaint?

1751
02:05:15.484 --> 02:05:16.942
No.

1752
02:05:17.078 --> 02:05:19.653
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

1753
02:05:19.789 --> 02:05:22.154
I... I felt sorry for her.

1754
02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:23.890
Is this something you
shared with Sharon?

1755
02:05:24.017 --> 02:05:25.785
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

1756
02:05:25.921 --> 02:05:27.794
- Don't you think you should have?
- Yes. Yes.

1757
02:05:27.930 --> 02:05:29.493
Well, what-what do you advise?

1758
02:05:29.628 --> 02:05:32.124
Well, for now, it hasn't
gotten all that much traction.

1759
02:05:32.259 --> 02:05:34.827
None of the trades have
linked to it or called for comment.

1760
02:05:34.962 --> 02:05:37.271
- So I say let's see what happens.
- Mm-hmm.

1761
02:05:38.507 --> 02:05:41.975
We wanted to give you as
much warning as possible, Lydia,

1762
02:05:42.111 --> 02:05:44.044
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

1763
02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:45.979
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

1764
02:05:46.115 --> 02:05:48.311
Well, I very much
advise that you are.

1765
02:05:48.447 --> 02:05:50.146
I have the book
launch in New York

1766
02:05:50.281 --> 02:05:52.988
and apparently a deposition.

1767
02:05:54.223 --> 02:05:57.223
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

1768
02:05:59.795 --> 02:06:01.557
Enjoy your weekend.

1769
02:06:03.797 --> 02:06:05.863
Starving.

1770
02:06:05.999 --> 02:06:07.598
Finished my thing today.

1771
02:06:07.733 --> 02:06:10.605
Congratulations. We
should go out and celebrate.

1772
02:06:10.740 --> 02:06:12.564
I can't. I gotta pack.

1773
02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:14.471
- Hi!
- Hi, Lydia.

1774
02:06:19.881 --> 02:06:21.714
Sharon?

1775
02:06:21.849 --> 02:06:23.952
Yeah?

1776
02:06:24.088 --> 02:06:25.846
You seen my performance score?

1777
02:06:25.981 --> 02:06:28.218
No. Why? Isn't it
with the other ones?

1778
02:06:28.353 --> 02:06:30.254
No. No, it's not.

1779
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:33.094
Are you sure it's
not in my office?

1780
02:06:35.428 --> 02:06:38.198
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

1781
02:06:39.828 --> 02:06:42.367
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

1782
02:06:45.105 --> 02:06:47.669
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

1783
02:07:04.685 --> 02:07:06.824
Lydia?

1784
02:07:09.389 --> 02:07:10.797
Yes?

1785
02:07:10.932 --> 02:07:13.667
When will you be back?

1786
02:07:13.803 --> 02:07:15.966
The day after tomorrow.

1787
02:07:16.101 --> 02:07:17.802
Will you promise?

1788
02:07:17.937 --> 02:07:20.306
Yes, I promise.

1789
02:07:30.712 --> 02:07:33.121
- Good night.
- Good night.

1790
02:07:47.267 --> 02:07:49.537
Thanks. Do you have any bottles?

1791
02:07:49.672 --> 02:07:50.967
Of course.

1792
02:07:51.970 --> 02:07:54.170
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

1793
02:07:54.243 --> 02:07:57.310
Uh, yes. Uh, we're
waiting on one more.

1794
02:08:03.911 --> 02:08:05.217
<i>To all my questions</i>

1795
02:08:05.353 --> 02:08:07.019
pertaining to your
communications

1796
02:08:07.155 --> 02:08:09.791
with Krista Taylor and others,

1797
02:08:09.927 --> 02:08:12.324
your answers have always been

1798
02:08:12.459 --> 02:08:17.264
"I don't know" or
"I don't remember."

1799
02:08:19.433 --> 02:08:20.959
Is there anything
I could show you

1800
02:08:21.095 --> 02:08:23.972
that might help refresh
your recollection?

1801
02:08:24.107 --> 02:08:26.570
Any documents, such
as emails from you

1802
02:08:26.705 --> 02:08:29.168
or your personal
assistant, Miss Lentini,

1803
02:08:29.304 --> 02:08:33.313
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

1804
02:08:41.353 --> 02:08:43.090
I guess you heard by now.

1805
02:08:43.226 --> 02:08:46.161
Bryant Park bumped
you to 53rd Street.

1806
02:08:49.289 --> 02:08:52.332
This is the Kaplan
Fund's prepared statement.

1807
02:08:54.367 --> 02:08:55.895
I'm sorry to say this is likely

1808
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:57.403
the last time we'll
see each other.

1809
02:08:57.538 --> 02:08:59.831
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

1810
02:08:59.966 --> 02:09:01.341
And you can bother someone else

1811
02:09:01.476 --> 02:09:04.910
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

1812
02:09:22.394 --> 02:09:24.762
Is there a back entrance?

1813
02:09:24.897 --> 02:09:29.103
"Indeed, the common
metaphors used to explain music

1814
02:09:29.239 --> 02:09:31.303
"are based on
the idea that music

1815
02:09:31.439 --> 02:09:36.034
"is a language,
albeit a secret one.

1816
02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:41.249
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

1817
02:09:42.881 --> 02:09:46.453
"These joyful noises we
make being the closest thing

1818
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:50.555
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

1819
02:09:51.859 --> 02:09:56.858
"... yet something born by
the mere act of moving air.

1820
02:09:59.035 --> 02:10:01.632
No different than birdsong."

1821
02:10:10.403 --> 02:10:12.743
So, meet downstairs in
half an hour for dinner?

1822
02:10:12.878 --> 02:10:15.580
Thank you, but I am
jet-lagged. I go to sleep now.

1823
02:10:15.715 --> 02:10:19.782
Yeah, me, too. I'll...
probably do the same.

1824
02:11:18.477 --> 02:11:20.071
Yes, hello.

1825
02:11:20.207 --> 02:11:22.984
Yes, there's no
water in my room.

1826
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:25.144
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

1827
02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:27.584
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

1828
02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.490
Uh, don't worry.
I'll just come down.

1829
02:11:33.393 --> 02:11:34.989
Lobby, please.

1830
02:12:01.848 --> 02:12:04.682
Oh, Jesus.

1831
02:12:16.996 --> 02:12:19.506
It was Britta.

1832
02:12:20.337 --> 02:12:22.100
Right?

1833
02:12:22.236 --> 02:12:24.070
I mean, that is how
you heard about

1834
02:12:24.205 --> 02:12:26.745
these millennial
robots trading in lies.

1835
02:12:26.880 --> 02:12:29.548
I couldn't care less
about the Juilliard thing.

1836
02:12:29.683 --> 02:12:31.709
Too much time on her hands.

1837
02:12:31.845 --> 02:12:33.084
She's fringe.

1838
02:12:33.219 --> 02:12:35.422
The worst kind.

1839
02:12:35.557 --> 02:12:37.625
Every time I walk
out of this house,

1840
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:41.386
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

1841
02:12:41.522 --> 02:12:44.663
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

1842
02:12:44.798 --> 02:12:47.765
God, a nobody who
has nothing better to do

1843
02:12:47.901 --> 02:12:52.237
than drop my name at
lunch and imply things.

1844
02:12:52.372 --> 02:12:53.974
I feel sorry for you.

1845
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:56.103
Save it.

1846
02:12:57.104 --> 02:12:59.480
I tried calling you last night.

1847
02:13:01.415 --> 02:13:04.084
Did you have fun with her?

1848
02:13:04.219 --> 02:13:07.019
My back is killing me.

1849
02:13:07.154 --> 02:13:08.413
Francesca left,

1850
02:13:08.548 --> 02:13:10.984
and I simply needed
someone to carry my bags.

1851
02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:13.027
I mean, who was
I supposed to ask?

1852
02:13:13.163 --> 02:13:16.096
To go with me? Hmm? Knut?

1853
02:13:16.232 --> 02:13:17.664
Jesus fucking...

1854
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.992
There are many things
I accept about you.

1855
02:13:20.127 --> 02:13:21.503
And in the end,

1856
02:13:21.638 --> 02:13:25.430
I'm sure I could get
over something like this.

1857
02:13:25.565 --> 02:13:28.443
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

1858
02:13:30.904 --> 02:13:32.205
These accusations

1859
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:35.483
from the parents of
the girl who suicided?

1860
02:13:40.513 --> 02:13:43.117
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

1861
02:13:47.294 --> 02:13:48.958
They're lies.

1862
02:13:50.698 --> 02:13:52.399
Do you understand
what it was like

1863
02:13:52.535 --> 02:13:54.535
to walk into my
sectional yesterday

1864
02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:57.530
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

1865
02:13:57.665 --> 02:14:02.207
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

1866
02:14:02.343 --> 02:14:04.304
It's a simple matter

1867
02:14:04.439 --> 02:14:07.813
of not warning me that
our family is in danger.

1868
02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:10.817
And what good
would that have done?

1869
02:14:10.953 --> 02:14:13.886
I mean, what could you
possibly do to make things better?

1870
02:14:16.357 --> 02:14:18.553
Because I deserve that.

1871
02:14:18.689 --> 02:14:20.825
Those are the rules.

1872
02:14:21.794 --> 02:14:24.229
You are to ask for
my fucking counsel,

1873
02:14:24.365 --> 02:14:26.325
the way you always have.

1874
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.164
The way you did when
you first arrived here

1875
02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:31.163
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

1876
02:14:31.299 --> 02:14:33.574
You asked me what
were the politics,

1877
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:36.667
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

1878
02:14:39.345 --> 02:14:41.011
Of course...

1879
02:14:41.146 --> 02:14:44.546
these conversations
took place in another bed.

1880
02:14:44.682 --> 02:14:47.380
Or rather, the couch

1881
02:14:47.515 --> 02:14:49.848
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

1882
02:14:49.984 --> 02:14:52.659
Old sorrow blows in.

1883
02:14:54.195 --> 02:14:58.665
How cruel of you to define
our relationship as transactional.

1884
02:15:01.828 --> 02:15:05.870
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

1885
02:15:06.005 --> 02:15:08.940
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

1886
02:15:09.075 --> 02:15:12.173
Apparently, this hasn't
even crossed your mind.

1887
02:17:24.743 --> 02:17:26.846
Petra!

1888
02:17:29.418 --> 02:17:31.081
Come here, darling.

1889
02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:34.687
- It was good.
- Was it?

1890
02:17:34.823 --> 02:17:37.154
- Yeah.
- You want to go to the park?

1891
02:17:38.024 --> 02:17:40.127
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1892
02:17:40.263 --> 02:17:41.861
Please don't.

1893
02:18:07.886 --> 02:18:10.382
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

1894
02:18:10.518 --> 02:18:13.354
This is my late
mother's apartment.

1895
02:18:14.787 --> 02:18:18.165
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

1896
02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:20.399
Thank you.

1897
02:18:20.535 --> 02:18:22.562
How's your sister doing?

1898
02:18:22.697 --> 02:18:25.768
Eleanor lives now in
a facility in Neukölln.

1899
02:18:25.904 --> 02:18:27.599
I'm sorry to trouble you,

1900
02:18:27.734 --> 02:18:30.908
but my husband and
I are selling the place

1901
02:18:31.044 --> 02:18:35.147
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

1902
02:18:36.543 --> 02:18:37.915
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1903
02:18:38.051 --> 02:18:39.618
We were wondering if there are

1904
02:18:39.753 --> 02:18:41.580
specific hours you rehearse,

1905
02:18:41.715 --> 02:18:44.386
so we can schedule
showings around them.

1906
02:18:45.422 --> 02:18:48.262
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

1907
02:18:48.398 --> 02:18:50.760
with all the noise.

1908
02:18:50.895 --> 02:18:53.363
Oh, no.

1909
02:18:53.499 --> 02:18:54.499
No.

1910
02:18:56.737 --> 02:18:58.634
No, we wouldn't want that.

Come on, give me some eyes!

1923
02:21:47.335 --> 02:21:49.075
Lydia.

1924
02:21:49.908 --> 02:21:52.637
This is my score.

1925
02:21:52.772 --> 02:21:54.982
Lydia, you're confused.

1926
02:21:55.117 --> 02:21:56.950
It's my score!

1927
02:21:57.086 --> 02:22:00.482
You fucking little nothing!

1928
02:22:08.764 --> 02:22:09.795
I'm fine.

1929
02:22:39.455 --> 02:22:42.061
You sign CAMI voucher.

1930
02:23:04.051 --> 02:23:06.517
Good afternoon. CAMI.

1931
02:23:06.653 --> 02:23:08.221
Hold on.

1932
02:23:09.157 --> 02:23:10.686
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

1933
02:23:10.822 --> 02:23:13.291
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

1934
02:23:13.426 --> 02:23:15.720
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

1935
02:23:15.856 --> 02:23:19.198
So, I'd like to team
you with Jake here.

1936
02:23:19.333 --> 02:23:21.735
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

1937
02:23:21.871 --> 02:23:23.369
what you've prepared for her?

1938
02:23:23.505 --> 02:23:25.704
Well...

1939
02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:28.140
right now it's a reset.

1940
02:23:28.275 --> 02:23:29.906
What we're after
is less, not more.

1941
02:23:30.042 --> 02:23:31.143
We want to be selective

1942
02:23:31.278 --> 02:23:33.209
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

1943
02:23:33.344 --> 02:23:35.346
That means we need a new story.

1944
02:23:39.855 --> 02:23:41.554
Just here.

1945
02:23:41.689 --> 02:23:43.284
Here. Thank you.

1946
02:23:43.419 --> 02:23:45.393
Make it 40.

1947
02:23:45.528 --> 02:23:47.094
Thank you.

1948
02:25:20.553 --> 02:25:22.480
Didn't you feel triumphant?

1949
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:29.659
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

1950
02:25:29.794 --> 02:25:33.926
It's the way it makes
you feel when you hear it.

1951
02:25:34.061 --> 02:25:37.029
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

1952
02:25:37.164 --> 02:25:39.538
And we're there. We know
what music means now.

1953
02:25:39.674 --> 02:25:42.374
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

1954
02:25:42.509 --> 02:25:44.840
and flats and chords
and all that business

1955
02:25:44.976 --> 02:25:49.781
in order to understand
music if it tells us something.

1956
02:25:49.916 --> 02:25:53.354
And the most wonderful thing
of all is that there's no limit to

1957
02:25:53.489 --> 02:25:57.589
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

1958
02:25:57.724 --> 02:26:01.525
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

1959
02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:04.029
that they can't even
be described in words.

1960
02:26:04.165 --> 02:26:05.362
You see, we can't always name

1961
02:26:05.498 --> 02:26:06.766
the things we feel.

1962
02:26:06.901 --> 02:26:07.901
Sometimes we can.

1963
02:26:08.002 --> 02:26:09.368
We can say we feel joy,

1964
02:26:09.503 --> 02:26:13.202
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

1965
02:26:13.338 --> 02:26:15.440
But every once in a while,

1966
02:26:15.576 --> 02:26:18.275
we have feelings that
are so deep and so special

1967
02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:20.036
that we have no words for them.

1968
02:26:20.172 --> 02:26:23.048
And that's where
music is so marvelous,

1969
02:26:23.183 --> 02:26:25.316
because music names them for us,

1970
02:26:25.452 --> 02:26:28.251
only in notes
instead of in words.

1971
02:26:28.386 --> 02:26:29.784
It's all in the way music moves.

1972
02:26:29.919 --> 02:26:32.556
You must never forget
that music is movement,

1973
02:26:32.691 --> 02:26:35.393
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

1974
02:26:35.529 --> 02:26:39.233
and flowing from
one note to another.

1975
02:26:39.368 --> 02:26:40.730
And that movement can tell us

1976
02:26:40.865 --> 02:26:43.994
more about the way we
feel than a million words can.

1977
02:26:44.130 --> 02:26:45.731
And here we're
going to play you a...

1978
02:27:00.216 --> 02:27:01.915
Tony.

1979
02:27:04.892 --> 02:27:06.021
Hi, Linda.

1980
02:27:06.156 --> 02:27:07.451
Sorry.

1981
02:27:07.586 --> 02:27:09.654
Lydia.

1982
02:27:09.789 --> 02:27:12.029
Ma said you'd be over.

1983
02:27:12.165 --> 02:27:14.499
You must be hiding out.

1984
02:27:15.268 --> 02:27:17.794
Why would I be hiding out?

1985
02:27:17.930 --> 02:27:20.006
Beats the hell out of me.

1986
02:27:20.141 --> 02:27:22.408
None of my business anyhow.

1987
02:27:23.477 --> 02:27:25.972
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

1988
02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:29.107
What do you mean?

1989
02:27:29.242 --> 02:27:31.452
Well, like I said, it
ain't my business.

1990
02:27:32.622 --> 02:27:34.782
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

1991
02:27:34.913 --> 02:27:36.587
or where you're going.

1992
02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:30.641
May I come inside?

1993
02:28:31.913 --> 02:28:33.545
Thank you.

1994
02:28:45.488 --> 02:28:47.023
Um, I'm so sorry.

1995
02:28:47.159 --> 02:28:49.693
Uh, we just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

1996
02:28:49.828 --> 02:28:51.763
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

1997
02:28:53.494 --> 02:28:56.536
I-I must tell you that I-I
looked in the music libraries,

1998
02:28:56.671 --> 02:29:00.272
uh, for her score, but
I-I couldn't find anything.

1999
02:29:00.407 --> 02:29:02.535
This just arrived.

2000
02:29:02.671 --> 02:29:04.873
That's great. Thank you.

2001
02:29:06.076 --> 02:29:08.548
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

2002
02:29:08.683 --> 02:29:10.807
- the sights of our beautiful country.
- Oh. Thank you.

2003
02:29:10.942 --> 02:29:12.610
Thank you so much.

2004
02:29:12.746 --> 02:29:14.755
Oh, goodness.

2005
02:29:14.890 --> 02:29:16.588
Thank-thank you.

2006
02:29:47.722 --> 02:29:51.815
Maybe we could stop
somewhere and take a swim.

2007
02:29:51.951 --> 02:29:53.422
Yeah, at the waterfall.

2008
02:29:53.558 --> 02:29:55.528
But, mm, not in the river.

2009
02:29:55.663 --> 02:29:58.098
Why? Is there something
wrong with the water?

2010
02:29:58.233 --> 02:30:00.832
N-No. There are crocodiles.

2011
02:30:02.934 --> 02:30:05.438
I didn't think they'd
be this far inland.

2012
02:30:05.574 --> 02:30:08.499
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

2013
02:30:08.635 --> 02:30:10.109
Wow.

2014
02:30:10.245 --> 02:30:13.011
That was a long time ago.

2015
02:30:13.147 --> 02:30:14.943
They survive.

2016
02:30:49.178 --> 02:30:51.650
Lady. Lady.

2017
02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:55.046
Here is prescription.

2018
02:30:55.181 --> 02:30:56.813
- Ten dollars.
- Oh. Thank you.

2019
02:30:58.221 --> 02:31:02.327
Uh, is there somewhere
around here-- thank you--

2020
02:31:02.462 --> 02:31:04.389
Where I could get a massage?

2021
02:31:04.524 --> 02:31:06.997
Was hoping it might
help me with this jet lag.

2022
02:31:11.137 --> 02:31:12.263
Yes.

2023
02:31:12.398 --> 02:31:15.073
There is the very
nice place I know.

2024
02:31:15.208 --> 02:31:16.838
Thank you.

2025
02:31:30.025 --> 02:31:31.225
Thank you.

2026
02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:33.125
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

2027
02:31:33.261 --> 02:31:35.027
The... the fishbowl?

2028
02:31:35.162 --> 02:31:36.827
Yes, over there.

2029
02:31:42.337 --> 02:31:43.568
Um, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

2030
02:31:43.704 --> 02:31:45.902
H-How does this...
how does it work?

2031
02:31:46.704 --> 02:31:48.938
You just pick a number here.

2032
02:31:50.342 --> 02:31:52.273
I pick a number?

2033
02:31:52.409 --> 02:31:53.980
Yes.

2034
02:32:04.921 --> 02:32:07.187
Number five?

2035
02:32:50.568 --> 02:32:52.262
Good morning.

2036
02:32:52.397 --> 02:32:53.773
Good morning.

2037
02:32:53.909 --> 02:32:56.433
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

2038
02:32:56.569 --> 02:33:00.075
the composer's
intent with this piece.

2039
02:33:01.416 --> 02:33:03.313
And what she might be after.

2040
02:33:22.428 --> 02:33:24.264
Five minutes.

2041
02:33:55.802 --> 02:33:57.803
Thank you.

2042
02:34:21.592 --> 02:34:25.596
Sisters and brothers of
the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

2043
02:34:25.731 --> 02:34:28.191
I'll keep my farewell brief.

2044
02:34:28.327 --> 02:34:30.793
Never was much with words.

2045
02:34:30.929 --> 02:34:34.932
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2046
02:34:35.067 --> 02:34:39.211
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2047
02:34:41.849 --> 02:34:43.706
If any of you have
lost your nerve,

2048
02:34:43.842 --> 02:34:48.077
then step away now
and let no one judge you.
