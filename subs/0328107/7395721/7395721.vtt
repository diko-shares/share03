1
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.503
Follow these instructions

2
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:03.246
or God be with your child.

3
00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:05.133
You will remove your shirt

4
00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:07.340
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

5
00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.296
Be professional.

6
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.303
Come alone.

7
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:17.306
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

8
00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:19.771
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

9
00:34:20.903 --> 00:34:24.153
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

10
00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:27.987
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

11
00:34:28.076 --> 00:34:30.282
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

12
00:52:53.668 --> 00:52:58.376

13
00:53:09.767 --> 00:53:13.432
This man, John W Creasy,

14
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:15.145
an American citizen,

15
00:53:15.231 --> 00:53:17.022
is under arrest for the murder

16
00:53:17.274 --> 00:53:19.729
of two officers ofthe Judicial Police

17
00:53:22.404 --> 00:53:25.073
and is suspected of possible involvement

18
00:53:25.157 --> 00:53:27.908
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

19
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:32.748
Chief Ramirez...

20
00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:37.454
The two officers who were killed.

21
00:53:37.544 --> 00:53:39.916
Records show they were off duty at the time.

22
00:53:40.631 --> 00:53:43.122
So why were they in uniform

23
00:53:43.425 --> 00:53:44.373
and in a patrol car?

24
00:53:44.468 --> 00:53:48.216
All I know is that they died bravely.

25
00:53:49.181 --> 00:53:50.425
Of course,

26
00:53:50.516 --> 00:53:53.220
but what exactly were they doing

27
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.720
at the scene of the kidnapping?

28
00:53:55.437 --> 00:53:58.556
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

29
00:53:58.649 --> 00:54:00.641
They were known for being corrupt

30
00:54:00.734 --> 00:54:03.189
and now are celebrated for being dead.

31
01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:17.382
What's going on, guys?

32
01:02:17.474 --> 01:02:19.051
Ambush!

33
01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:59.425
God be with your child.

34
01:03:26.501 --> 01:03:28.873
You're negotiating directly with me.

35
01:05:47.226 --> 01:05:50.844
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

36
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.222
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

37
01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:57.527
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

38
01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:01.858
How long will he be hospitalised?

39
01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:03.858
Approximately a month.

40
01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:12.461
Do you know who he is?

41
01:18:12.545 --> 01:18:15.415
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

42
01:18:16.257 --> 01:18:17.834
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

43
01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.124
Pakistan...

44
01:18:28.227 --> 01:18:31.560
He can go places we can't.

45
01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:35.524
Ifyou don't want to use him... I will.

46
01:18:38.154 --> 01:18:40.395
- Mariana...
- Si

47
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:42.778
When do I get to sleep with you again?

48
01:18:42.867 --> 01:18:44.444
We never sleep. We fuck.

49
01:18:44.535 --> 01:18:46.242
Give it to me.

50
01:18:47.246 --> 01:18:49.404
Give it to me.

51
01:18:49.498 --> 01:18:51.870
Gracias.

52
01:19:29.997 --> 01:19:31.740
Jorge Gonzï¿½lez.

53
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:34.957
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

54
01:19:35.419 --> 01:19:38.503
Drive.

55
01:21:02.588 --> 01:21:03.536
Can you hear me?

56
01:21:03.881 --> 01:21:04.995
My head hurts.

57
01:21:09.011 --> 01:21:10.802
I am going to ask questions.

58
01:21:13.349 --> 01:21:15.388
If you don't answer fully and truthfully,

59
01:21:15.476 --> 01:21:17.883
you will suffer much more than you have to.

60
01:21:18.604 --> 01:21:20.976
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

61
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.524
One by one, if I have to.

62
01:21:30.574 --> 01:21:32.732
This is to stop the bleeding.

63
01:21:34.078 --> 01:21:36.200
OK? Ahora.

64
01:21:36.288 --> 01:21:38.613
Don't mess with me.

65
01:21:45.214 --> 01:21:47.787
A member of La Hermandad.

66
01:21:49.051 --> 01:21:51.802
- Correcto?
- Correct.

67
01:22:25.003 --> 01:22:30.245
What do you want to know?

68
01:22:31.092 --> 01:22:32.467
The Ramos kidnapping...

69
01:22:34.262 --> 01:22:37.713
What went wrong at the drop?

70
01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:43.847
We were just ordered to take her.

71
01:22:44.605 --> 01:22:46.431
That's all we did.

72
01:22:47.525 --> 01:22:48.438
Ordered by who?

73
01:22:48.776 --> 01:22:50.056
I don't know.

74
01:22:50.403 --> 01:22:52.728
You don't know?

75
01:22:59.745 --> 01:23:01.073
We work in separate groups.

76
01:23:01.164 --> 01:23:02.243
A voice calls.

77
01:23:02.331 --> 01:23:03.445
We grab the target

78
01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:06.625
and deliver it to the guardians.

79
01:23:10.423 --> 01:23:12.166
The bosses never see the target,

80
01:23:12.508 --> 01:23:14.085
they just make the deal.

81
01:23:16.429 --> 01:23:18.717
Who ordered it?

82
01:23:23.727 --> 01:23:24.806
We call him "The Voice".

83
01:23:25.354 --> 01:23:26.896
"The Voice." OK.

84
01:23:27.481 --> 01:23:28.643
"The Voice", Si.

85
01:23:30.025 --> 01:23:31.400
The Voice.

86
01:23:32.987 --> 01:23:34.315
The Voice. How do I find him?

87
01:23:40.744 --> 01:23:42.866
You don't know?

88
01:23:43.956 --> 01:23:45.829
Are you sure?

89
01:23:59.137 --> 01:24:02.340
I believe you.

90
01:24:14.152 --> 01:24:15.895
Tell me about the guardians.

91
01:24:20.033 --> 01:24:21.692
I'm a professional.

92
01:24:22.911 --> 01:24:25.580
I'm a professional. I just do my job.

93
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:31.916
Tell me about the guardians.

94
01:24:35.131 --> 01:24:38.131
- Guardianes.
- Guardianes, OK. Guardianes.

95
01:24:42.597 --> 01:24:44.091
You don't know?

96
01:24:44.182 --> 01:24:46.258
I don't know.

97
01:24:59.364 --> 01:25:01.855
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

98
01:25:01.949 --> 01:25:02.980
He has a mark

99
01:25:03.076 --> 01:25:05.033
on the left side of his face.

100
01:25:05.119 --> 01:25:07.491
They call him "The Butcher".

101
01:25:08.706 --> 01:25:09.785
Is he La Hermandad?

102
01:25:10.208 --> 01:25:12.496
Yes, La Hermandad.

103
01:25:17.214 --> 01:25:19.787
Wait, wait, wait.

104
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.132
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

105
01:27:48.155 --> 01:27:50.313
Tell me about the girl.

106
01:27:50.407 --> 01:27:51.651
I don't know her.

107
01:28:40.498 --> 01:28:42.989
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

108
01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:49.380
Tell me about the girl.

109
01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:55.424
Do you know her?

110
01:31:39.717 --> 01:31:41.958
They threw the little girl against the wall.

111
01:31:42.053 --> 01:31:46.346
She wasn't moving.

112
01:31:47.516 --> 01:31:50.931
They threw her body in the trunk of the car,

113
01:31:52.104 --> 01:31:54.226
and then they drove away.

114
01:31:54.315 --> 01:31:57.150
Who? Who? Who's they?

115
01:31:58.527 --> 01:32:00.186
The boss's brother.

116
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:04.069
I recognised his voice.

117
01:32:10.247 --> 01:32:11.445
Now listen to me.

118
01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.825
If you tell me where to find the boss,

119
01:32:17.504 --> 01:32:18.879
I'll let you live.

120
01:32:20.674 --> 01:32:22.750
But I don't know.

121
01:32:26.847 --> 01:32:28.590
I'll give you the girl.

122
01:32:30.309 --> 01:32:32.135
I'll give you the girl.

123
01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:34.385
What girl?

124
01:32:34.897 --> 01:32:35.643
The girl...

125
01:32:36.231 --> 01:32:38.057
Do you want the girl?

126
01:32:38.734 --> 01:32:41.984
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

127
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:43.528
- The girl.
- Here?

128
01:32:47.325 --> 01:32:48.154
You sure?

129
01:32:51.663 --> 01:32:53.073
Show me.

130
01:39:01.403 --> 01:39:05.946
I need the accounts linked to this card.

131
01:39:11.038 --> 01:39:15.949
PIN number is 4747.

132
01:39:16.668 --> 01:39:20.119
On one condition.

133
01:40:05.425 --> 01:40:09.208
I'm not here to hurt you.

134
01:40:22.859 --> 01:40:25.350
In the church, they say to forgive.

135
01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:28.993
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

136
01:57:30.581 --> 01:57:34.115
The PIN number was a great locator.

137
01:57:34.210 --> 01:57:38.871
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

138
01:57:40.883 --> 01:57:43.456
Who's that?

139
01:57:44.303 --> 01:57:45.631
He's the man,

140
01:57:45.721 --> 01:57:47.179
The Voice.

141
01:57:47.807 --> 01:57:50.048
My guys got into the house...

142
01:57:51.519 --> 01:57:54.306
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

143
01:57:57.024 --> 01:57:59.312
We had to inject the whole barrio.

144
01:58:01.946 --> 01:58:06.157
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

145
01:58:14.667 --> 01:58:17.703
Now it's time to pursue him.

146
01:58:18.754 --> 01:58:22.169
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

147
01:58:57.626 --> 01:59:00.626
If you value your life,

148
01:59:00.754 --> 01:59:03.920
you won't publish those photos.

149
01:59:39.751 --> 01:59:41.209
"FEAR HAS A VOICE."

150
02:00:56.952 --> 02:00:57.817
He's in.

151
02:00:57.911 --> 02:00:59.618
What do we do?

152
02:01:00.205 --> 02:01:01.319
Nothing... Nothing.

153
02:01:56.552 --> 02:01:57.962
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

154
02:01:58.054 --> 02:01:59.464
Stop there!

155
02:02:47.936 --> 02:02:49.643
Get out. The kids out. Now!

156
02:02:58.947 --> 02:03:00.191
Sit down.

157
02:03:03.327 --> 02:03:04.821
Sit down!

158
02:03:07.164 --> 02:03:08.408
Reina Rosas, yes?

159
02:03:17.048 --> 02:03:20.298
Who is this? Who is this?

160
02:03:34.482 --> 02:03:34.979
Daniel.

161
02:03:35.191 --> 02:03:36.104
Daniel what?

162
02:03:36.651 --> 02:03:37.813
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

163
02:03:39.737 --> 02:03:42.441
The Voice?

164
02:03:46.077 --> 02:03:47.784
And this is his brother?

165
02:03:51.541 --> 02:03:52.489
What is his name?

166
02:03:55.837 --> 02:03:56.868
What is his name?

167
02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:17.601
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

168
02:04:19.652 --> 02:04:20.932
How do you contact him?

169
02:04:23.698 --> 02:04:25.690
How do you contact him?

170
02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:28.149
We page him,

171
02:04:31.664 --> 02:04:33.537
and he calls back on his cellphone.

172
02:04:36.293 --> 02:04:37.870
Call him.

173
02:04:49.598 --> 02:04:51.637
There's no signal in here.

174
02:04:51.725 --> 02:04:54.132
We have to go on the roof.

175
02:04:56.772 --> 02:04:57.803
Let's go outside.

176
02:05:06.990 --> 02:05:08.816
Outside.

177
02:05:19.836 --> 02:05:21.034
Momento.

178
02:05:21.129 --> 02:05:22.291
They're going to get a call.

179
02:05:23.715 --> 02:05:25.422
Be ready to track him.

180
02:05:26.384 --> 02:05:30.002
If we're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

181
02:09:03.557 --> 02:09:05.514
Little one...

182
02:09:05.601 --> 02:09:07.889
What do you call your teddy bear?

183
02:10:11.541 --> 02:10:15.918
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

184
02:10:16.004 --> 02:10:17.546
We got cut off.

185
02:10:19.465 --> 02:10:21.291
We lost him. We lost him.
