1
00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.179
THERE IS ONE KIDNAPPING EVERY 60 MINUTES
IN LATIN AMERICA.

2
00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:38.349
70% OF THE VICTIMS DO NOT SURVIVE.

3
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.155
Family is everything, no?

4
00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.534
Now, do you love your son?

5
00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:52.715
Now, do you understand?

6
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.221
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

7
00:02:58.763 --> 00:03:00.223
Follow these instructions

8
00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:02.976
or God be with your child.

9
00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:04.853
You will remove your shirt

10
00:03:04.936 --> 00:03:07.063
and hold it out the window
to ID the car.

11
00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.024
Be professional.

12
00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.026
Come alone.

13
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.708
EL PASO, TEXAS
USA-MEXICO BORDER

14
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:13.231
Georgina! Obey me.
I will love you. Come on.

15
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.526
- That's how it works, huh?
- That's right.

16
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.911
She got a sister?

17
00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:29.914
How's business?

18
00:05:31.165 --> 00:05:34.127
The Japanese are here in a big way.

19
00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:42.135
Cheap labour, factory space, but they feel
a lot safer living over the border in El Paso.

20
00:05:42.218 --> 00:05:47.306
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

21
00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:55.023
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

22
00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:01.863
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

23
00:06:01.946 --> 00:06:06.617
No. I've been movin' around. You know.
Colombia, a couple of places I can't name.

24
00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:09.996
Nothin' catches my fancy.

25
00:06:13.124 --> 00:06:16.627
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

26
00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:18.921
- No.
- You don't?

27
00:06:19.005 --> 00:06:20.339
Me either.

28
00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:27.555
- How long you stayin'?
- I don't know, I just... you know.

29
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:31.642
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

30
00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:34.312
I just came by on impulse.

31
00:06:34.395 --> 00:06:36.939
I could do with some impulse.

32
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:49.911
What happened?

33
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:57.502
Family paid the ransom, then they
sent the kid home after a couple of days.

34
00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:59.754
Minus an ear, of course.

35
00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:03.549
Now every mother in Mexico City
with money wants bigger bodyguards.

36
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:07.929
- My own wife included.
- I hate to break it to you, but she's right.

37
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:10.431
She's right.

38
00:07:10.515 --> 00:07:14.936
Look, Sammy, all my clients
have kidnap and ransom insurance.

39
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:18.272
I have a policy.
AIG. My dad gave it to me.

40
00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:21.234
Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad.

41
00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:25.988
But what'll you do in 60 days when you can't
renew it because you have no bodyguard?

42
00:07:26.072 --> 00:07:28.950
I know. I had to let Emilio go.

43
00:07:29.033 --> 00:07:34.163
Well, you gotta please Lisa.
I mean, ass like that's hard to find.

44
00:07:35.206 --> 00:07:37.291
Look.

45
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:42.713
A bodyguard's like anything else.
You get what you pay for, OK?

46
00:07:42.797 --> 00:07:45.758
You could do this.
Get one that's got a decent résumé.

47
00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:49.971
We're not lookin' for goddamn Superman,
right? Get someone cheap.

48
00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:56.686
So you renew the policy, and then
fire the prick for whatever - incompetence.

49
00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:01.440
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school,

50
00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:04.485
and that your wife gets to save face.

51
00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:11.075
This way you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighbourhood.

52
00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:25.506
That's right, a bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

53
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.676
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

54
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.761
In my state, I couldn't guard a corpse.

55
00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:34.849
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show. Nothing's gonna happen.

56
00:08:34.932 --> 00:08:39.437
Yeah? You think they'd
hire a drunk, a has-been?

57
00:08:40.813 --> 00:08:43.065
You have to keep it under control.

58
00:08:44.442 --> 00:08:49.280
What if there was, you know... just, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

59
00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:54.243
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

60
00:08:54.327 --> 00:08:58.748
It's not exactly a scam, Crease.
Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.

61
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:02.585
Yeah. A bodyguard's gotta
be close to people though.

62
00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:05.713
They talk all the time.
You know I'm no good at that.

63
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:09.842
You'll be the silent type.
They're gonna appreciate that.

64
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:19.685
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

65
00:09:19.769 --> 00:09:22.563
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

66
00:09:22.647 --> 00:09:26.943
- He owns one of the plants in Juárez.
- Yeah?

67
00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:29.487
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

68
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.990
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

69
00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:36.911
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

70
00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:40.957
He asked me if I knew anybody he could trust.

71
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.043
- And you thought of me?
- Yeah.

72
00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:47.672
Take a job, Crease. Breathe some air.

73
00:09:47.755 --> 00:09:50.007
Then decide if you want to stick around.

74
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:54.387
Besides, I'm glad to see you, you know?
I got nobody to talk to down here.

75
00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:06.983
Listen, my wife wants
someone presentable and polite.

76
00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:10.611
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

77
00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:12.446
Your résumé's quite impressive.

78
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:17.076
16 years of military experience,
extensive counter-terrorism work.

79
00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:20.579
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

80
00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:22.873
I drink.

81
00:10:22.957 --> 00:10:25.042
How does that affect you?

82
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:29.755
Coordination, reaction time.

83
00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:33.384
If top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can,

84
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.970
but the service will be on a par with the pay.

85
00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:39.974
What if amateurs try it?

86
00:10:40.057 --> 00:10:43.394
I'd probably kill 'em. Is that likely?

87
00:10:43.477 --> 00:10:45.354
No.

88
00:10:45.438 --> 00:10:50.693
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

89
00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.095
Lisa!

90
00:11:20.097 --> 00:11:22.183
Lisa!

91
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:37.281
My wife Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

92
00:11:43.245 --> 00:11:45.539
- You're an American.
- So are you.

93
00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:48.376
It's all in there.

94
00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:57.176
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes. Jack and water would be good.

95
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.971
Have you done much of
this kind of work before?

96
00:12:01.055 --> 00:12:02.223
No, ma'am.

97
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:06.143
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

98
00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:11.357
- Do you have a family, Mr Creasy?
- No.

99
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.402
Pita? Pita.

100
00:12:18.197 --> 00:12:21.158
- Yes, Mom?
- Honey, this is Mr Creasy.

101
00:12:26.288 --> 00:12:31.293
It's English, honey. Do you wanna
show Mr Creasy to his room?

102
00:12:31.377 --> 00:12:33.838
- This way, Mr Creasy.
- OK.

103
00:12:43.556 --> 00:12:45.766
Thank you.

104
00:12:52.648 --> 00:12:54.024
Just like that?

105
00:12:55.484 --> 00:13:00.531
I think it's nice that he's an American.

106
00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:04.869
I think it's terrific. Are you sure?

107
00:13:07.496 --> 00:13:09.373
Thank you.

108
00:13:09.707 --> 00:13:11.333
Thank you.

109
00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:14.462
I feel better now.

110
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.472
That's Bruno, the gardener.
And that's Maria, the cook.

111
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:33.731
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

112
00:13:36.775 --> 00:13:40.738
You've got a TV and a CD player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr Creasy?

113
00:13:40.821 --> 00:13:44.492
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

114
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:47.453
I don't know.

115
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:52.124
That's Bird. Emilio forgot
to take him when he left.

116
00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:55.544
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

117
00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:01.759
Have you protected
a lot of children before, Mr Creasy?

118
00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:05.596
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

119
00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:07.515
Creasy.

120
00:14:07.598 --> 00:14:09.892
Bye, Creasy.

121
00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:14.313
Bye, Bird.

122
00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:29.078
- School tomorrow, Peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

123
00:14:29.161 --> 00:14:31.622
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

124
00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.874
Yeah, we'll see.

125
00:14:33.958 --> 00:14:38.963
If you get a dog, will you give up your bear?
You're getting too old for him.

126
00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:47.555
- How did you like Mr Creasy?
- Creasy. He said to call him just Creasy.

127
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:51.684
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?
- No, not if he asked you.

128
00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:54.687
Here. There you go.

129
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.613
He's like a bear too.

130
00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:07.700
- Yeah?
- A big, sad bear.

131
00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:13.998
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

132
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.546
Good night, honey.

133
00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:25.259
Can you get me some floss in the morning?

134
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:27.303
- Floss?
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.

135
00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:29.221
Sure.

136
00:15:32.266 --> 00:15:34.351
Good night, Bear.

137
00:15:35.394 --> 00:15:37.479
Creasy Bear.

138
00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:15.309
- What's that one for?
- La Virgen de Guadalupe.

139
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:19.229
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

140
00:16:19.313 --> 00:16:24.818
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one. I don't know.

141
00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:29.198
She likes him.

142
00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:33.202
- What are you talkin' about?
- Creasy.

143
00:16:34.703 --> 00:16:36.789
Pita likes him.

144
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:44.672
Pita loves school. Pita would love Count
Dracula if he took her back there, honey.

145
00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:46.632
OK?

146
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:51.220
Hey. Are you OK?

147
00:16:51.303 --> 00:16:53.764
- I don't know.
- OK?

148
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.770
I don't know, Lisa. I'm trying.

149
00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:57.953
Come on, Bird.

150
00:17:58.036 --> 00:18:00.998
That's right, that's right. Come on.

151
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:02.833
All right.

152
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.835
Home to Emilio.

153
00:18:05.794 --> 00:18:07.796
You're home free, baby.

154
00:18:27.858 --> 00:18:30.652
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The US.

155
00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:33.697
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

156
00:18:33.781 --> 00:18:41.455
- You can drive and talk at the same time.
- No, I can't, Pita, so please let me do my job.

157
00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:43.248
Are you going to stay?

158
00:18:44.666 --> 00:18:49.505
My last bodyguard left. Somebody
gave him more money than we could.

159
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:53.550
I guess that makes me a bargain then, huh?

160
00:18:53.634 --> 00:18:58.806
Being black. Is that a positive or a negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

161
00:18:58.889 --> 00:19:01.099
Time will tell.

162
00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:07.773
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City
in the last six days.

163
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.442
- Four a day.
- Yeah? 24?

164
00:19:10.526 --> 00:19:14.321
- 24. What do you think about that?
- I think you know more than you should.

165
00:19:14.404 --> 00:19:16.240
Well, thank you.

166
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.312
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

167
00:19:47.396 --> 00:19:50.774
- What?
- You have to sign in. Show them your ID.

168
00:19:53.026 --> 00:19:54.361
Come on.

169
00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.364
Right there.

170
00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:16.717
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

171
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.137
Sister Anna,
this is my new bodyguard, Creasy.

172
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.308
- Sister Anna, the headmistress.
- Señor Creasy.

173
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:29.938
- Hurry. Class is about to begin. Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

174
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.818
You must look after our Pita.
It is not good that she is late today.

175
00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:39.364
I'm very sorry. I have to get used to
the routes. It won't happen again.

176
00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:43.201
No offence, but I regret that
your profession needs to exist.

177
00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:46.371
So do I, Madre, so do I.

178
00:20:46.455 --> 00:20:50.208
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

179
00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:53.962
No, not for a long time.

180
00:20:54.046 --> 00:20:56.924
The Bible says,
be not overcome of evil...

181
00:20:57.007 --> 00:21:01.219
But overcome evil with good.

182
00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:04.181
That's Romans Chapter 12 Verse 21.

183
00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:10.187
I am the sheep that got lost, Madre.

184
00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:17.921
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

185
00:22:18.005 --> 00:22:20.382
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

186
00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:24.386
No, I don't remember.
No, I didn't like it.

187
00:22:24.469 --> 00:22:26.763
Why not?

188
00:22:26.847 --> 00:22:31.351
Because it wasn't a school like yours, Pita.
There was no Sister Anna.

189
00:22:34.021 --> 00:22:36.398
Were you unhappy?

190
00:22:38.525 --> 00:22:41.987
Being unhappy, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

191
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:53.749
What happened to your hand?

192
00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.918
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

193
00:22:57.002 --> 00:22:58.503
Look, no more questions, OK?

194
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:05.260
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question to me.

195
00:23:08.889 --> 00:23:11.266
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you.

196
00:23:11.349 --> 00:23:12.392
No, no, no.

197
00:23:12.476 --> 00:23:16.021
I'm being paid to be your bodyguard.
Look at me.

198
00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:22.903
I'm not being paid to be your friend, but
to protect you. So no more questions, period.

199
00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:26.448
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

200
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.870
- No crying.
- I'm not crying.

201
00:23:32.913 --> 00:23:35.040
Well, don't start.

202
00:23:35.123 --> 00:23:38.627
You gotta understand, this is a job.
In order for me to do my job...

203
00:23:41.296 --> 00:23:43.590
Wait a minute.

204
00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:33.974
Yeah, come in.

205
00:24:39.563 --> 00:24:41.648
Mr Creasy.

206
00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:45.318
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

207
00:24:45.402 --> 00:24:46.862
I'm fine, thanks.

208
00:24:48.488 --> 00:24:52.993
Is the food all right?
Because Maria told me you didn't eat.

209
00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:59.332
Yeah, the food is great.
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

210
00:25:01.793 --> 00:25:04.462
So you read the Bible?

211
00:25:05.297 --> 00:25:08.049
Yeah, sometimes.

212
00:25:08.133 --> 00:25:10.260
Does it help?

213
00:25:10.343 --> 00:25:12.053
Yeah, sometimes.

214
00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:17.517
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

215
00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:22.480
How are you doing with Pita?

216
00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:24.149
Fine.

217
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:27.777
As soon as she figures out that
I'm not her new toy, it'll be fine.

218
00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:30.363
- She told me about that.
- OK.

219
00:25:31.907 --> 00:25:35.285
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

220
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:38.330
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

221
00:25:38.413 --> 00:25:41.041
And Pita just wants to be friends.

222
00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:42.792
OK.

223
00:25:42.876 --> 00:25:48.381
But you're paying me to protect her,
not to be her friend, right?

224
00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:51.968
So...

225
00:25:53.261 --> 00:25:55.764
Look, maybe this isn't gonna work out.

226
00:25:55.847 --> 00:26:01.061
Maybe your husband should find
somebody that's a little more sociable.

227
00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:04.814
No, you're right.

228
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:10.111
You're being paid to protect her.

229
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:13.740
And I'm confident that you'll do that.

230
00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:23.208
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

231
00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:55.532
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

232
00:27:21.182 --> 00:27:25.145
I'm tired of killin', Ray.
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

233
00:27:28.106 --> 00:27:32.569
You think God'll forgive us
for what we've done?

234
00:27:32.652 --> 00:27:34.863
In my state, I couldn't...

235
00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:37.073
I couldn't guard a corpse.

236
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:39.159
They talk all the time.

237
00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:42.078
You know I'm no good at that.

238
00:27:42.454 --> 00:27:45.290
You know I'm no good at that.

239
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:48.335
You know how they say...

240
00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:53.131
a bullet always tells the truth?

241
00:28:34.339 --> 00:28:36.132
Yeah?

242
00:28:36.216 --> 00:28:38.468
- Hey.
- Crease.

243
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:40.220
What's wrong?

244
00:28:40.303 --> 00:28:46.393
Hey, listen, you ever have
a 9mm round that didn't go off?

245
00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:49.104
Yeah. Failure to fire.

246
00:28:49.187 --> 00:28:52.357
I know, failure to fire and...

247
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.487
You know, I pulled the trigger
and click, nothing.

248
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.033
- You're talkin' about a bad primer.
- Yeah, yeah, but I...

249
00:29:02.117 --> 00:29:06.871
Yeah, right. Dimple on the primer.
That may be...

250
00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:09.332
Well, like we used to say...

251
00:29:10.667 --> 00:29:13.461
a bullet always tells the truth.

252
00:29:20.552 --> 00:29:23.430
Crease? You all right?

253
00:29:23.513 --> 00:29:25.265
Yeah.

254
00:29:26.307 --> 00:29:28.726
What were you shootin' at?

255
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.104
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry I woke you.

256
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:35.233
No, it's OK, it's nothin'.
I was watchin' TV.

257
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.195
OK.

258
00:30:58.816 --> 00:31:01.444
Pita, you have a pencil?

259
00:31:05.907 --> 00:31:07.575
Thank you.

260
00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:46.197
- It's hard to get used to the traffic down here.
- Yeah. I'm very sorry.

261
00:32:06.843 --> 00:32:08.970
- See you, baby.
- See you later.

262
00:32:09.053 --> 00:32:13.391
- Hey, don't forget your towel.
- Thank you.

263
00:32:18.896 --> 00:32:20.773
Bye.

264
00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:29.384
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

265
00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:37.183
Thanks.

266
00:33:40.478 --> 00:33:43.189
So, what do I do?

267
00:33:43.272 --> 00:33:46.776
You're the fastest in the water,
the slowest off the blocks.

268
00:33:46.859 --> 00:33:49.237
What do you think that means?
What you gotta do?

269
00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.448
- Get faster off the blocks?
- Get faster off the blocks.

270
00:33:53.449 --> 00:33:55.868
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

271
00:33:55.952 --> 00:34:01.708
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- You'll be fine. You'll be OK.

272
00:34:03.418 --> 00:34:05.795
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

273
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:11.092
- I never finish better than third.
- Then maybe you are slow.

274
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:17.056
With us this evening we have
Mariana Guerrero from Reforma newspaper

275
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.517
to speak with us about the kidnappings.

276
00:34:20.643 --> 00:34:23.896
Who are the ones responsible
for the kidnappings in Mexico?

277
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.734
It is an activity of organised crime.
It's not a random kidnapping.

278
00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:30.027
They are not political kidnappings
like in Colombia.

279
00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:42.957
How do you think he got out?

280
00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:45.960
I let him go.

281
00:34:46.043 --> 00:34:49.714
- It's better to be free, right?
- It's better for him.

282
00:34:51.424 --> 00:34:54.385
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

283
00:34:57.972 --> 00:34:59.891
Good night.

284
00:35:05.021 --> 00:35:06.856
Good night.

285
00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:24.999
- See you in a couple of days, OK? I love you.
- Love you.

286
00:35:25.082 --> 00:35:26.959
Be good. Come on, Lise.

287
00:35:27.043 --> 00:35:30.546
All right, sweetheart,
so we'll call you from Detroit, OK?

288
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.549
- I love you.
- Love you.

289
00:35:37.929 --> 00:35:42.308
- OK, bye, honey. I love you!
- Love you.

290
00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:49.190
I hate leaving her.

291
00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:04.997
Concentrating?

292
00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:07.166
Eyes are closed?

293
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.214
- What happened?
- I flinched.

294
00:36:13.297 --> 00:36:15.716
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.

295
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.220
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- The gunshot holds no fear! Say it!

296
00:36:19.303 --> 00:36:21.013
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

297
00:36:21.097 --> 00:36:23.349
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

298
00:36:23.432 --> 00:36:27.061
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good. You welcome the sound.

299
00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:29.272
In fact, it's the sound that sets you free.

300
00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:33.734
You are a prisoner on this block until
that sound sets you free. Are you ready?

301
00:36:33.818 --> 00:36:36.529
- Yes.
- Are you ready? Are you set?

302
00:36:44.579 --> 00:36:46.664
Creasy?

303
00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:49.083
What's a concubine?

304
00:36:49.166 --> 00:36:52.461
- Why do you ask?
- It's in my history book.

305
00:36:53.504 --> 00:36:57.300
- It's like a wife, right?
- Yeah, yeah, it's...

306
00:36:57.383 --> 00:36:59.760
Can I see that? It's kind of a wife.

307
00:36:59.844 --> 00:37:01.220
Right there.

308
00:37:01.304 --> 00:37:04.599
But the Emperor of China had 1,000 of them.

309
00:37:06.392 --> 00:37:10.354
OK, like nowadays, in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

310
00:37:10.438 --> 00:37:17.194
But in the olden-time cultures they had,
you know, different... different rules.

311
00:37:18.988 --> 00:37:21.073
Why? You feel sorry for the husband?

312
00:37:21.157 --> 00:37:25.411
Yeah. Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

313
00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:29.373
Creasy.

314
00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:32.084
- You're smiling.
- What?

315
00:37:32.168 --> 00:37:34.420
- You were smiling.
- No, I'm not.

316
00:37:34.503 --> 00:37:35.755
- You were.
- No, I was not.

317
00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:38.591
- You're not now, but you were.
- You were smiling. I wasn't.

318
00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:40.092
- You were.
- When?

319
00:37:40.176 --> 00:37:42.720
- Five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

320
00:37:42.803 --> 00:37:47.516
- Well, a second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

321
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.810
- Ten seconds ago.
- Ten seconds ago I was smiling.

322
00:37:49.894 --> 00:37:53.981
OK, in the next ten seconds,
we'll see who smiles first.

323
00:37:57.443 --> 00:37:59.946
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- You.

324
00:38:00.029 --> 00:38:02.531
No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.

325
00:38:02.615 --> 00:38:08.329
That's not a smile. A smirk is different. They
both start with S, but they're not the same...

326
00:38:08.412 --> 00:38:11.207
- Do your homework.
- You were.

327
00:38:14.251 --> 00:38:16.128
Bang!

328
00:38:17.088 --> 00:38:19.757
Stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

329
00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.133
Bang!

330
00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.679
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

331
00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:28.182
Come here. Hurry up, hurry up.

332
00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:29.934
Set.

333
00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:32.520
Bang! Bang!

334
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:40.069
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

335
00:38:40.152 --> 00:38:45.366
Listen for the sound. You don't anticipate.
Concentrate on the sound. Understand me?

336
00:38:45.449 --> 00:38:47.535
They're gaining on you. Go, go, go, go!

337
00:38:47.618 --> 00:38:51.998
Stop, stop! Come on, get out. Let's go again.

338
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:12.852
- Daddy!
- Come here, girl.

339
00:39:14.353 --> 00:39:17.481
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

340
00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:20.776
I got a surprise for you. Are you ready?

341
00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:23.404
You got me a dog! You got me a dog!

342
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:26.991
- You bought me a dog! Oh, my gosh!
- What do you think?

343
00:39:27.074 --> 00:39:30.578
Oh, my gosh.
Just what I wanted. What's his name?

344
00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:33.664
- Sam. Like Dad.
- Come on, Sam! Come on, Sam!

345
00:39:35.291 --> 00:39:37.376
State...

346
00:39:39.837 --> 00:39:42.715
Bhutan. It's a Himalayan kingdom.

347
00:39:42.798 --> 00:39:46.385
They were having some problems
with the royal family not long ago.

348
00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:48.179
OK.

349
00:39:50.056 --> 00:39:52.516
Any more questions?

350
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.897
- Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
- What? No. What kind of question is that?

351
00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:01.275
- You're supposed to be studying history.
- It's Creasy history.

352
00:40:01.358 --> 00:40:04.278
- No, ancient history.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

353
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.488
- Nonya.
- Nonya?

354
00:40:05.571 --> 00:40:09.033
Nonya business, that's who. OK?

355
00:40:09.742 --> 00:40:11.702
Hi.

356
00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:15.498
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

357
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:17.666
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.753
All right. Well, I'll...

359
00:40:20.836 --> 00:40:23.547
I'll leave you to your history.

360
00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:26.550
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

361
00:40:29.345 --> 00:40:31.472
- OK, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

362
00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:40.940
Go, Pita! Go, go, go, go, go!

363
00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:45.611
Go, go, go, go, go!

364
00:40:49.323 --> 00:40:51.575
- 10.99.
- Yes!

365
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.456
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

366
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.918
There's trained and there's untrained.
Now, which are you?

367
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:04.463
- Trained.
- Trained. OK, we'll go again.

368
00:41:12.805 --> 00:41:14.890
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

369
00:41:14.974 --> 00:41:16.600
OK. Hey.

370
00:41:16.684 --> 00:41:19.895
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

371
00:41:19.979 --> 00:41:23.899
That's right. Don't smile, don't fool around
if you wanna win. Trained or untrained?

372
00:41:23.983 --> 00:41:25.651
- Trained.
- Go.

373
00:41:26.694 --> 00:41:31.407
- Señor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Good to see you, Madre.

374
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.160
Pita's parents are away
on business in Juárez.

375
00:41:34.243 --> 00:41:36.912
Today, you are her father.

376
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.090
I won, Creasy! I won!

377
00:43:11.173 --> 00:43:13.676
- OK.
- I won!

378
00:43:23.978 --> 00:43:28.482
- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When I was young.

379
00:43:28.565 --> 00:43:31.568
Well, when we were young
and he was younger,

380
00:43:31.652 --> 00:43:34.530
and all heads turned our way,

381
00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:37.241
we made a deal to take the world together.

382
00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:41.287
Yeah, then one day I got a call,
and you said...

383
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:44.790
I'm in love, I'm in love!

384
00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:47.334
And I'm movin' to Mexico!

385
00:43:47.418 --> 00:43:49.962
And I said...

386
00:43:50.045 --> 00:43:53.590
I said, what happened to the plan?
What happened to it?

387
00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:58.512
- I said, the plan's right here!
- Yeah, yeah. And what'd I do?

388
00:43:58.595 --> 00:44:00.931
I hung up. And then I met Alicia.

389
00:44:01.015 --> 00:44:05.311
And then I went, now I got ya. I got ya.

390
00:44:05.394 --> 00:44:08.188
I got it. Can I kiss her?

391
00:44:08.272 --> 00:44:10.274
Absolutely.

392
00:44:10.357 --> 00:44:13.110
Hey, what are you doin'?

393
00:44:17.573 --> 00:44:22.286
- You got me.
- OK, I think now's as good a time as any.

394
00:44:25.122 --> 00:44:27.875
I bought it with my own money.

395
00:44:29.793 --> 00:44:31.879
Thank you.

396
00:44:33.464 --> 00:44:35.549
Open it.

397
00:44:39.887 --> 00:44:44.475
It's Saint Jude,
the patron saint of lost causes.

398
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.272
Well deserved.

399
00:44:54.318 --> 00:44:57.112
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

400
00:44:58.572 --> 00:45:00.657
You're welcome.

401
00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:52.042
- Dad?
- Yes, sweetie?

402
00:45:52.126 --> 00:45:54.711
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes.

403
00:45:56.338 --> 00:45:59.383
I don't wanna play piano, I wanna swim.

404
00:45:59.466 --> 00:46:03.804
It's not open for discussion, honey, OK?
Mr Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher.

405
00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:08.225
If he accepts you as a student,
you're gonna play the piano. Sorry.

406
00:46:08.308 --> 00:46:10.269
- Whatever.
- Baby.

407
00:46:12.813 --> 00:46:15.441
- I love you.
- Love you.

408
00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:18.777
- I just want what's best for you, you know?
- OK.

409
00:46:18.861 --> 00:46:21.113
OK, honey.

410
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.084
If you broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together,

411
00:46:34.168 --> 00:46:37.045
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

412
00:46:37.129 --> 00:46:39.423
Sam, get back.

413
00:46:39.506 --> 00:46:42.509
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

414
00:46:42.593 --> 00:46:44.678
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

415
00:46:47.931 --> 00:46:50.476
Remember the day you wanted the pencil?

416
00:46:50.559 --> 00:46:53.729
- Yeah.
- I know why.

417
00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:55.355
Yeah?

418
00:46:55.439 --> 00:47:00.110
You wanted the licence number off of that car.
I wrote it down in my notebook.

419
00:47:00.194 --> 00:47:02.863
I got it all but the last number.

420
00:47:02.946 --> 00:47:06.200
I'll get it from you later. Can you belch?

421
00:47:06.283 --> 00:47:08.535
Like burp. Can you burp?

422
00:47:12.789 --> 00:47:17.419
- That's good. That's very good.
- I just had a Coke.

423
00:47:17.503 --> 00:47:19.880
Listen to me. This famous teacher...

424
00:47:19.963 --> 00:47:24.051
He teaches a lot of rich kids and plays
for the symphonies and all that, right?

425
00:47:24.134 --> 00:47:26.803
Belch every few minutes
while you're practising.

426
00:47:26.887 --> 00:47:31.725
You apologise to him, but you keep belching.
You'll offend every sensibility he has.

427
00:47:31.808 --> 00:47:35.521
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

428
00:47:35.604 --> 00:47:37.689
Right, Sam?

429
00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:46.823
Lupita Ramos.

430
00:47:49.993 --> 00:47:52.162
For you, Creasy.

431
00:47:55.415 --> 00:47:57.292
Thank you.

432
00:48:00.587 --> 00:48:03.924
- How does this look?
- Good. Good.

433
00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:09.346
Come on in.

434
00:48:09.429 --> 00:48:10.472
Bye.

435
00:48:10.556 --> 00:48:12.641
- How long?
- One hour.

436
00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:19.351
Pita!

437
00:50:22.104 --> 00:50:22.979
Pita!

438
00:50:33.073 --> 00:50:35.117
Pita!

439
00:50:44.084 --> 00:50:45.752
Run!

440
00:52:04.456 --> 00:52:06.917
Creasy!

441
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.002
Creasy!

442
00:52:11.129 --> 00:52:13.381
Creasy. Creasy!

443
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:16.384
Creasy!

444
00:52:28.772 --> 00:52:30.315
I can't...

445
00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:58.134
John W Creasy is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police.

446
00:52:58.218 --> 00:52:59.511
Creasy!

447
00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:13.191
This man, John W Creasy,

448
00:53:13.275 --> 00:53:14.901
an American citizen,

449
00:53:14.985 --> 00:53:16.778
is under arrest for the murder

450
00:53:17.028 --> 00:53:19.489
of two officers of the Judicial Police

451
00:53:22.158 --> 00:53:24.828
and is suspected of possible involvement

452
00:53:24.911 --> 00:53:27.664
in the kidnapping of Lupita Martin Ramos.

453
00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:32.502
Chief Ramirez...

454
00:53:34.671 --> 00:53:37.215
The two officers who were killed.

455
00:53:37.299 --> 00:53:39.676
Records show they were off duty at the time.

456
00:53:40.385 --> 00:53:42.888
So why were they in uniform

457
00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:44.139
and in a patrol car?

458
00:53:44.222 --> 00:53:47.976
All I know is that they died bravely.

459
00:53:48.935 --> 00:53:50.186
Of course,

460
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:52.981
but what exactly were they doing

461
00:53:53.064 --> 00:53:54.482
at the scene of the kidnapping?

462
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:58.320
Or were they known
for their exceptional good luck?

463
00:53:58.403 --> 00:54:00.405
They were known for being corrupt

464
00:54:00.488 --> 00:54:02.949
and now are celebrated for being dead.

465
00:54:59.923 --> 00:55:02.384
Excuse me.

466
00:55:08.098 --> 00:55:10.266
Relax, OK? Relax, Sammy.

467
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:19.234
I know she's your little girl. When
I tell you everything's gonna be all right,

468
00:55:19.317 --> 00:55:21.987
everything's gonna be all right.

469
00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:26.032
Señor Ramos.

470
00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.626
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

471
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:40.505
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policía Judicial.

472
00:55:40.588 --> 00:55:44.217
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

473
00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:49.681
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

474
00:55:49.764 --> 00:55:54.602
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and we
neither need nor want any police assistance.

475
00:55:54.686 --> 00:55:58.398
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

476
00:55:59.149 --> 00:56:05.655
Señor Ramos, two police officers were killed
during your daughter's abduction.

477
00:56:05.739 --> 00:56:08.658
I have a written order from...

478
00:56:08.825 --> 00:56:10.785
the Public Minister...

479
00:56:11.036 --> 00:56:13.038
authorising our participation...

480
00:56:13.121 --> 00:56:15.749
unofficially.

481
00:56:16.791 --> 00:56:21.588
If you want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

482
00:56:23.715 --> 00:56:25.425
OK.

483
00:56:25.508 --> 00:56:29.929
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

484
00:56:30.638 --> 00:56:32.599
Por favor, don't do that.

485
00:56:32.682 --> 00:56:38.396
Or you will find yourself in a real
Mexican hell. No mariachi, no tequila...

486
00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.565
and no Pita.

487
00:57:19.771 --> 00:57:20.814
Crease?

488
00:57:22.899 --> 00:57:23.942
Crease.

489
00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:30.573
When I heard it was this hospital,
I was so pleased.

490
00:57:30.657 --> 00:57:34.244
There is a pastry shop nearby.
Delgado's.

491
00:57:34.327 --> 00:57:38.540
They have the best pastries in Mexico.

492
00:57:38.623 --> 00:57:42.585
Miguel Manzano. Director of the AFI.

493
00:57:42.669 --> 00:57:48.800
And a former director of Interpol, in Rome.

494
00:57:49.926 --> 00:57:51.553
- And you are?
- A friend of his.

495
00:57:53.388 --> 00:57:55.223
Rayburn.

496
00:58:10.697 --> 00:58:13.408
Do you love your daughter, señor Ramos?

497
00:58:13.491 --> 00:58:15.618
Yes. Yes.

498
00:58:15.702 --> 00:58:18.913
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

499
00:58:18.997 --> 00:58:20.331
Señor...

500
00:58:21.332 --> 00:58:26.254
If your daughter's life is
as important to you as it is to me,

501
00:58:26.337 --> 00:58:28.673
you will do as I say.

502
00:58:28.756 --> 00:58:30.800
Yes?

503
00:58:30.884 --> 00:58:32.427
OK, yes.

504
00:58:33.094 --> 00:58:35.221
Crease. You hear me?

505
00:58:38.725 --> 00:58:40.977
You got four of 'em, all dead.

506
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:45.857
- Pita?
- It's...

507
00:58:47.734 --> 00:58:50.361
It's been two days.

508
00:58:50.445 --> 00:58:53.281
They're negotiating a ransom.

509
00:58:54.741 --> 00:58:58.369
These things take time, Mr Creasy.

510
00:59:02.957 --> 00:59:04.584
Crease.

511
00:59:06.794 --> 00:59:09.714
Don't fuck with me, all right?

512
00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:18.681
You have the ten million?
Do you have the money?

513
00:59:18.765 --> 00:59:22.560
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now, if you do as I say,

514
00:59:22.644 --> 00:59:27.023
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

515
00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:31.236
But if you deviate
from the process in any way...

516
00:59:31.819 --> 00:59:33.821
By the Virgin of Guadeloupe,

517
00:59:33.905 --> 00:59:36.407
I swear you will never see her again.

518
00:59:36.491 --> 00:59:39.619
I understand. Listen, I too
worship la Virgen de Guadalupe...

519
00:59:39.702 --> 00:59:41.746
I ask if you understand.

520
00:59:44.582 --> 00:59:47.835
Hello, sir.
This is Mr Ramos's attorney.

521
00:59:47.919 --> 00:59:50.880
He's going through a very difficult time,
but he understands.

522
00:59:50.964 --> 00:59:54.342
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

523
00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:59.597
OK, the money, ten million US, will be divided
into two 15-gallon black canvas bags,

524
00:59:59.681 --> 01:00:04.018
each containing five million, which
will be checked at the bank by the KR agent,

525
01:00:04.102 --> 01:00:08.731
then driven to the house in an armoured car,
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.

526
01:00:09.565 --> 01:00:12.360
You got a flat tyre here.

527
01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.529
This is for you.

528
01:00:15.613 --> 01:00:17.991
Hello. Yeah.

529
01:00:18.074 --> 01:00:20.660
Listen, I need a driver to drive Samuel.

530
01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.996
No. Why?

531
01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:26.916
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

532
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.211
Look, he's a nervous kid.
He doesn't respond well to stress.

533
01:00:32.338 --> 01:00:37.010
All right, but the car will not be powerful.

534
01:00:37.093 --> 01:00:38.386
Remove the trunk lid.

535
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.181
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

536
01:00:42.932 --> 01:00:46.769
You will arrive at La Diana fountain at 1 a.m.

537
01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:51.024
You will drive around the circle two times.

538
01:00:51.107 --> 01:00:59.073
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window to ID the car.

539
01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:03.911
There is a payphone on the southeast corner.

540
01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:09.834
The phone will ring.
You will answer and wait for instructions.

541
01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:14.839
There is a map on the top
of the phone. Follow it.

542
01:01:22.764 --> 01:01:25.767
- What are you doing? He said no phones.
- Relax, relax.

543
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:29.687
I'm just trying to protect your daughter, OK?

544
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:35.777
What's goin' on?

545
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.946
Hospitals can be very dangerous places,

546
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:42.992
especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

547
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.342
Leave the money in the trunk of the white car

548
01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:01.511
and return to your car.

549
01:02:03.304 --> 01:02:06.641
Do not look back.

550
01:02:15.483 --> 01:02:17.151
What's going on, guys?

551
01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:18.820
Ambush!

552
01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:28.746
Remember, I'm a professional.

553
01:02:29.038 --> 01:02:36.671
If you keep your word, I will keep mine.

554
01:02:46.013 --> 01:02:48.182
- Hello?
- Mr Ramos.

555
01:02:48.266 --> 01:02:51.811
You betrayed me. You killed my nephew.

556
01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:54.063
You took my money.

557
01:02:54.147 --> 01:02:56.149
Señor Ramos...

558
01:02:56.315 --> 01:02:59.193
God be with your child.

559
01:03:01.112 --> 01:03:05.992
All right. Get outta here, all of you.
Get the fuck out of my house!

560
01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:08.369
OK, this is Lisa...

561
01:03:09.245 --> 01:03:12.039
Martin Ramos. I'm Pita's mother.

562
01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:18.421
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

563
01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:21.591
Please don't harm my daughter.

564
01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:26.179
This conversation is not being recorded.

565
01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:28.639
You're negotiating directly with me.

566
01:03:28.723 --> 01:03:34.353
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, señora.

567
01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:37.148
I'm really sorry.

568
01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:39.942
Now it is too late.

569
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.248
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house! Now!

570
01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:58.044
Get out! Get out!

571
01:04:46.342 --> 01:04:49.303
Hey, Ray. How are you...?

572
01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:55.434
- Where am I?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

573
01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:03.317
Manzano was afraid
the cops were gonna kill ya.

574
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.445
How you doin', doc?

575
01:05:11.492 --> 01:05:13.578
What's the matter?

576
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:19.083
She's dead, Crease.

577
01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:26.132
It's a mess. Somebody
hijacked the drop and...

578
01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:34.473
The kidnapper's nephew was killed,
so he killed Pita.

579
01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:50.531
He has gunshot wounds
to the chest and the abdomen.

580
01:05:50.906 --> 01:05:52.908
He has a collapsed lung
which we've re-inflated.

581
01:05:52.992 --> 01:05:57.204
He's lucky to be alive.
If he doesn't rest, he will die.

582
01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.542
How long will he be hospitalised?

583
01:06:01.626 --> 01:06:03.544
Approximately a month.

584
01:06:06.047 --> 01:06:07.965
No.

585
01:06:15.806 --> 01:06:17.683
No.

586
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:25.941
Did you recognise any of these men?

587
01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:31.697
No. Does that make me a suspect?

588
01:06:32.448 --> 01:06:34.408
No.

589
01:06:34.492 --> 01:06:36.577
It would be convenient, but no.

590
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:41.957
Maybe you should show me pictures of some
Mexican cops. Maybe we'll get somewhere.

591
01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.460
Those were all policemen.

592
01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:47.630
Bad Judicial cops,

593
01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:52.051
protected, by a brotherhood.

594
01:06:52.134 --> 01:06:54.053
A brotherhood?

595
01:06:55.638 --> 01:06:59.392
A brotherhood, called...

596
01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:17.993
You all set?

597
01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:19.745
- Right arm.
- Yeah.

598
01:07:22.832 --> 01:07:25.334
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

599
01:07:25.418 --> 01:07:27.545
Let's go.

600
01:08:04.206 --> 01:08:06.375
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah.

601
01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:09.003
Lois Lane.

602
01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:13.007
Mariana something, works for Reforma.

603
01:08:13.632 --> 01:08:16.343
Newspaper journalist.

604
01:08:16.427 --> 01:08:19.680
I guess she thinks you're a scoop.

605
01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:23.017
I'll get you up to the border.

606
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.562
A friend will take you to San Diego,
drop you at the Naval Hospital.

607
01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:29.064
I'm not goin', Ray.

608
01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:31.650
What are you gonna do?

609
01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:35.404
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

610
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.936
Mr Creasy?

611
01:09:49.019 --> 01:09:51.772
A lot of people are looking for you.

612
01:09:52.857 --> 01:09:55.442
I'm Mariana García Guerrero.

613
01:09:56.277 --> 01:09:58.737
Reporter, for Reforma.

614
01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:03.784
Nice to meet you.

615
01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:05.828
I found this across the street.

616
01:10:09.498 --> 01:10:11.125
Open it.

617
01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:17.506
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship.

618
01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:25.014
- They've put a curse on you.
- A little late.

619
01:10:29.018 --> 01:10:33.355
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

620
01:10:36.525 --> 01:10:38.903
I can help you.

621
01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:44.992
There's a brotherhood called La Hermandad.

622
01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:48.954
It protects government officials,
corrupt police and organised crime

623
01:10:49.038 --> 01:10:53.542
at a level that is too difficult
for me to reach.

624
01:10:53.626 --> 01:10:55.169
OK.

625
01:10:55.252 --> 01:11:00.966
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims of this organisation.

626
01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:07.598
I want to expose them. Talk to me, give me
your story, and then I can help you. Please.

627
01:11:12.144 --> 01:11:14.438
Help me do what?

628
01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:18.525
You're gonna help me do what?

629
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:22.905
- You're a stranger here, no?
- That's right.

630
01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:27.368
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

631
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:29.536
OK.

632
01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.164
OK, friend that's gonna help me.

633
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.669
Pleasure to meet you.

634
01:11:36.752 --> 01:11:41.215
Tell your driver to keep his distance
next time. All right, friend?

635
01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:07.491
- You'll be Stateside by supper time.
- I'm gonna need some help first, though.

636
01:12:07.574 --> 01:12:10.661
You don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day in your shape.

637
01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:14.873
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah! But...

638
01:12:14.957 --> 01:12:17.084
- I'm done killing. I told you that.
- OK.

639
01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.128
Anything else is yours.

640
01:12:25.551 --> 01:12:30.139
- You're talkin' about war, Crease.
- Exactly. Can you help me?

641
01:12:33.017 --> 01:12:34.893
- Yeah.
- Good.

642
01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.845
Creasy?

643
01:14:46.275 --> 01:14:48.861
What are you doin' here?

644
01:14:56.368 --> 01:14:58.787
I came to get my stuff.

645
01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:02.332
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

646
01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:05.961
- I borrowed it.
- OK.

647
01:15:07.462 --> 01:15:09.423
It's crazy, huh?

648
01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:14.887
One week we're figuring out which
nightclub to go to, and the next thing I'm...

649
01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:17.097
readin' the Bible.

650
01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:19.850
It's a good thing. You hold on to it.

651
01:15:24.396 --> 01:15:29.234
I keep thinkin' if only we hadn't...

652
01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:34.239
It's like...

653
01:15:36.366 --> 01:15:42.831
My whole life all I've ever thought about
was what I could get for myself.

654
01:15:42.915 --> 01:15:45.834
Not my own baby.

655
01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:55.802
She needed me so much, and sometimes
I felt like I had nothin' to give her.

656
01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:58.889
Just... I don't know what to do.

657
01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:05.062
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

658
01:16:05.145 --> 01:16:07.231
I'm gonna kill 'em.

659
01:16:08.232 --> 01:16:14.947
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

660
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:16.949
You kill 'em all.

661
01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:21.972
REFORMA NEWSPAPER

662
01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:34.276
Yeah, it's me.

663
01:17:34.985 --> 01:17:38.780
- Mr Creasy.
- I need the licence... No, excuse me.

664
01:17:38.864 --> 01:17:43.952
I need the name and address of someone
whose licence number is C5TK8.

665
01:17:44.036 --> 01:17:47.873
That's C5TK8.

666
01:17:47.956 --> 01:17:52.044
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need ten possible matches.

667
01:17:52.127 --> 01:17:54.463
And when do I find out
which of the ten it is?

668
01:17:54.546 --> 01:17:57.341
- Eventually.
- But where do I reach you?

669
01:17:57.424 --> 01:17:59.509
I'll call you.

670
01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:09.728
AGENCY FOR FEDERAL INVESTIGATION
MEXICO CITY

671
01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:12.147
Do you know who he is?

672
01:18:12.230 --> 01:18:15.108
Do you know what he's been doing
the last 16 years?

673
01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:17.527
Counter-insurgency work in Thailand,

674
01:18:17.611 --> 01:18:18.820
Pakistan...

675
01:18:18.904 --> 01:18:21.615
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all of that.

676
01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:22.991
He's an assassin...

677
01:18:23.075 --> 01:18:27.287
and you want to help him identify
the owner of a car for him?

678
01:18:27.913 --> 01:18:31.249
He can go places we can't.

679
01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:35.212
If you don't want to use him... I will.

680
01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:42.469
When do I get to sleep with you again?

681
01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:44.137
We never sleep. We fuck.

682
01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:45.931
Give it to me.

683
01:18:46.932 --> 01:18:49.101
Give it to me.

684
01:19:29.683 --> 01:19:31.435
Jorge González.

685
01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:34.646
I'm a Judicial Policeman.

686
01:19:35.105 --> 01:19:38.191
Drive.

687
01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:39.693
OK.

688
01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.054
What are you gonna do?

689
01:20:08.138 --> 01:20:10.557
What I do best.

690
01:20:12.267 --> 01:20:16.438
Anyone that was involved, who profited
from it, anybody who opens their eyes at me.

691
01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.607
I'm gonna kill 'em.

692
01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:03.235
Can you hear me?

693
01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:04.694
My head hurts.

694
01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.492
I am going to ask questions.

695
01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:15.080
If you don't answer fully and truthfully,

696
01:21:15.163 --> 01:21:17.582
you will suffer much more than you have to.

697
01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:20.669
I'm going to cut your fingers off.

698
01:21:26.508 --> 01:21:29.219
One by one, if I have to.

699
01:21:30.262 --> 01:21:32.430
This is to stop the bleeding.

700
01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:38.311
Don't mess with me.

701
01:21:40.689 --> 01:21:43.483
You know who I am?

702
01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:47.487
A member of La Hermandad.

703
01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.450
Correct.

704
01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:29.946
What do you want to know?

705
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:32.157
The Ramos kidnapping...

706
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:37.412
What went wrong at the drop?

707
01:22:40.749 --> 01:22:43.543
We were just ordered to take her.

708
01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:46.129
That's all we did.

709
01:22:47.213 --> 01:22:48.131
Ordered by who?

710
01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:49.758
I don't know.

711
01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:52.427
You don't know?

712
01:22:59.434 --> 01:23:00.769
We work in separate groups.

713
01:23:00.852 --> 01:23:01.936
A voice calls.

714
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.146
We grab the target

715
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:06.316
and deliver it to the guardians.

716
01:23:10.111 --> 01:23:11.863
The bosses never see the target,

717
01:23:12.197 --> 01:23:13.782
they just make the deal.

718
01:23:16.117 --> 01:23:18.411
Who ordered it?

719
01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:24.501
We call him The Voice.

720
01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:26.586
The Voice. OK.

721
01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.338
The Voice.

722
01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:31.091
The Voice.

723
01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:34.010
The Voice. How do I find him?

724
01:23:40.433 --> 01:23:42.560
You don't know?

725
01:23:43.645 --> 01:23:45.522
Are you sure?

726
01:23:51.736 --> 01:23:53.530
OK.

727
01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:56.658
OK.

728
01:23:58.827 --> 01:24:02.038
I believe you.

729
01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:15.593
Tell me about the guardians.

730
01:24:19.723 --> 01:24:21.391
I'm a professional.

731
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.270
I'm a professional. I just do my job.

732
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.609
Tell me about the guardians.

733
01:24:42.287 --> 01:24:43.788
You don't know?

734
01:24:43.872 --> 01:24:45.957
I don't know.

735
01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:01.556
He works the door at a rave in Neza.

736
01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:02.682
He has a mark

737
01:25:02.766 --> 01:25:04.726
on the left side of his face.

738
01:25:04.809 --> 01:25:07.187
They call him The Butcher.

739
01:25:08.396 --> 01:25:09.481
Is he La Hermandad?

740
01:25:09.898 --> 01:25:12.192
Yes, La Hermandad.

741
01:25:15.487 --> 01:25:16.821
OK.

742
01:25:16.905 --> 01:25:19.491
Wait, wait, wait.

743
01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.827
Give me one cigarette, please, eh?

744
01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:28.583
OK.

745
01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.882
OK, my friend.

746
01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:39.844
It's off to the next life for you.

747
01:25:41.221 --> 01:25:44.349
I guarantee you won't be lonely.

748
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:12.168
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

749
01:26:58.381 --> 01:27:01.217
THE RAVE - NEZA

750
01:27:47.847 --> 01:27:50.016
Tell me about the girl.

751
01:27:50.099 --> 01:27:51.392
I don't know her.

752
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:42.694
OK, OK. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

753
01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:49.075
Tell me about the girl.

754
01:28:54.122 --> 01:28:55.123
Do you know her?

755
01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:01.045
No?

756
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:20.106
Hey, man, I heard you speaking Spanish
over there. You're American, right?

757
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:22.066
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

758
01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:24.652
- Get outta here. Where you from?
- New Jersey.

759
01:29:24.736 --> 01:29:26.946
New Jersey? I'm from New Jersey.

760
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:28.531
All right, listen to me.

761
01:29:28.614 --> 01:29:31.576
Tell me how it works. The whole thing.
Tell me how it works.

762
01:29:31.659 --> 01:29:34.203
All right, everything is done by cellphone.

763
01:29:34.287 --> 01:29:37.790
You just wait around for calls.
We don't even have a fuckin' number.

764
01:29:37.874 --> 01:29:39.959
- Who pays you?
- We got an ATM card.

765
01:29:40.043 --> 01:29:45.131
We take out 200 fuckin' measly dollars
every two weeks.

766
01:29:46.799 --> 01:29:48.134
- 200 dollars?
- Yeah.

767
01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:51.179
- OK. What's the PIN number?
- The what?

768
01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:54.682
- The PIN number, code number.
- Yeah, it's 4747.

769
01:29:56.851 --> 01:29:58.019
- Yeah.
- Good.

770
01:29:58.102 --> 01:29:59.979
- You wouldn't lie to me?
- I'm not lyin'.

771
01:30:00.063 --> 01:30:02.106
- You didn't kill her, did you?
- No.

772
01:30:05.651 --> 01:30:06.652
Don't lie to me!

773
01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:10.698
- Don't lie to me! Did you kill her?
- You're makin' me fuckin' nervous.

774
01:30:10.782 --> 01:30:13.701
- Did you kill her?
- No! The fuckin' boss did, or his brother.

775
01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:15.912
Who's the boss?

776
01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:19.123
- We never see his face.
- You're lyin' to me.

777
01:30:19.916 --> 01:30:21.459
I'm tellin' you the truth!

778
01:30:21.542 --> 01:30:23.169
Who? You never seen whose face?

779
01:30:23.252 --> 01:30:25.671
Well, we were in the other room.

780
01:30:26.589 --> 01:30:32.386
And he was yellin' at the girl cos his nephew
got killed and the money got stolen.

781
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:36.099
- Wait. Somebody stole what money?
- The ransom money at the drop.

782
01:30:36.182 --> 01:30:39.102
- Who stole it?
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.

783
01:30:39.185 --> 01:30:40.895
- Who?
- Fuentes.

784
01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:43.106
- Fuentes?
- Yeah, that's him.

785
01:30:44.315 --> 01:30:46.192
All right?

786
01:30:46.275 --> 01:30:48.861
- Jersey boy?
- Yeah.

787
01:30:52.198 --> 01:30:53.950
- This Fuentes guy...
- Yeah?

788
01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:57.411
He's a lieutenant
for the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

789
01:30:57.495 --> 01:30:58.454
- Fuentes is?
- Yeah.

790
01:30:58.538 --> 01:31:00.998
- What'd you do?
- Oh, man.

791
01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:04.085
Tell me about the girl. What did you do?

792
01:31:04.168 --> 01:31:06.838
- I just do what they tell me.
- You do what they tell you to do?

793
01:31:06.921 --> 01:31:09.924
Did you say goodbye to her?
Answer. Did you say goodbye to her?

794
01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:11.509
- No!
- You didn't?

795
01:31:11.592 --> 01:31:13.845
- Here's your chance. Say goodbye.
- Oh, shit.

796
01:31:13.928 --> 01:31:16.806
Say goodbye to her. Say goodbye to her.

797
01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:18.850
Motherfucker, let me go!

798
01:31:39.412 --> 01:31:41.664
They threw the little girl against the wall.

799
01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:46.043
She wasn't moving.

800
01:31:47.211 --> 01:31:50.631
They threw her body in the trunk of the car,

801
01:31:51.799 --> 01:31:53.926
and then they drove away.

802
01:31:54.010 --> 01:31:56.846
Who? Who? Who's they?

803
01:31:58.222 --> 01:31:59.891
The boss's brother.

804
01:32:01.475 --> 01:32:03.561
I recognised his voice.

805
01:32:04.312 --> 01:32:06.606
OK. OK.

806
01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:11.152
Now listen to me.

807
01:32:11.235 --> 01:32:14.530
If you tell me where to find the boss,

808
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.576
I'll let you live.

809
01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:22.455
But I don't know.

810
01:32:26.542 --> 01:32:28.294
I'll give you the girl.

811
01:32:30.004 --> 01:32:31.839
I'll give you the girl.

812
01:32:32.882 --> 01:32:34.091
What girl?

813
01:32:34.592 --> 01:32:35.343
The girl...

814
01:32:35.927 --> 01:32:37.762
Do you want the girl?

815
01:32:38.429 --> 01:32:41.682
Yes, yes, but what girl?
What are you saying?

816
01:32:41.766 --> 01:32:43.226
- The girl.
- Here?

817
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:47.855
You sure?

818
01:32:51.359 --> 01:32:52.777
Show me.

819
01:34:25.286 --> 01:34:27.455
- Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

820
01:34:27.538 --> 01:34:31.709
Do you know about a young girl being
kidnapped recently, about 12 years old?

821
01:34:31.792 --> 01:34:35.796
- Yes, last night. Do you know something?
- What's her name?

822
01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.882
Camila. Camila Valencias.

823
01:34:42.261 --> 01:34:44.680
- I got her.
- Where are you?

824
01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.465
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's OK. Sit down, relax.

825
01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:22.343
She's OK, she's OK.

826
01:35:22.426 --> 01:35:25.012
You got banking connections?

827
01:35:25.096 --> 01:35:27.098
Yes, I have connections.

828
01:35:29.767 --> 01:35:35.606
PIN number's 4747. I wanna find out
who's puttin' money in that account.

829
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:38.025
4747.

830
01:35:39.985 --> 01:35:42.238
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

831
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:46.700
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.
He drove Samuel Ramos to the drop.

832
01:35:46.784 --> 01:35:49.954
- Fuentes?
- Who is she?

833
01:35:50.037 --> 01:35:52.456
You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

834
01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:55.084
What do you know about Fuentes?

835
01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:59.338
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

836
01:35:59.422 --> 01:36:05.302
Never charged. The arresting officer
couldn't testify cos he was dead.

837
01:36:05.386 --> 01:36:07.638
Was he La Hermandad?

838
01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:13.102
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a Judicial compound.

839
01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:16.147
He travels by motorcade.

840
01:36:18.941 --> 01:36:21.610
He's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

841
01:36:21.694 --> 01:36:23.904
He's gonna need it.
Can you take care of her?

842
01:36:23.988 --> 01:36:26.907
- Yes, but how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

843
01:36:54.602 --> 01:36:56.770
This is my jurisdiction.

844
01:36:58.522 --> 01:37:01.942
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

845
01:37:03.068 --> 01:37:07.698
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than ten years of your courts and tribunals.

846
01:37:07.781 --> 01:37:09.950
Just stay out of his way.

847
01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:11.702
I plan to.

848
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.754
I will even help him, if I can.

849
01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:26.884
But... I'd like to understand him.

850
01:37:29.386 --> 01:37:31.639
Give me that.

851
01:37:31.722 --> 01:37:33.807
Pita Ramos...

852
01:37:35.309 --> 01:37:37.686
is a number to you.

853
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:41.649
One more dead, but a number.

854
01:37:42.441 --> 01:37:47.279
- What was she to Creasy then?
- She showed him it was all right to live again.

855
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:53.577
And the kidnappers took that away, huh?

856
01:37:54.537 --> 01:38:00.042
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

857
01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:03.337
A man can be an artist...

858
01:38:06.173 --> 01:38:08.926
at anything, food, whatever.

859
01:38:09.009 --> 01:38:13.556
It depends on how good he is at it.

860
01:38:16.642 --> 01:38:18.727
Creasy's art is death.

861
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.483
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

862
01:38:32.575 --> 01:38:35.494
I don't have anything else to say.

863
01:39:01.103 --> 01:39:05.649
I need the accounts linked to this card.

864
01:39:10.738 --> 01:39:13.866
PIN number is 4747.

865
01:39:16.368 --> 01:39:19.830
On one condition.

866
01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:08.921
I'm not here to hurt you.

867
01:40:22.559 --> 01:40:25.062
In the church, they say to forgive.

868
01:40:25.145 --> 01:40:27.523
Forgiveness is between them and God.

869
01:40:27.606 --> 01:40:30.526
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

870
01:42:27.768 --> 01:42:29.561
Don't move. Put your hands down.

871
01:42:39.488 --> 01:42:41.907
Señor John W Creasy is under arrest

872
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:44.785
for the murder of two officers
of the Judicial Police...

873
01:42:44.868 --> 01:42:47.996
Creasy!

874
01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.706
Creasy!

875
01:43:23.282 --> 01:43:25.659
Can you hear me?

876
01:43:27.578 --> 01:43:29.746
You know where we are?

877
01:43:30.831 --> 01:43:33.166
We're under the bridge

878
01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:38.171
where the deal went bad
and the ransom got stolen.

879
01:43:38.255 --> 01:43:40.215
You wanna tell me what happened?

880
01:43:40.299 --> 01:43:42.843
- You've heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

881
01:43:42.926 --> 01:43:45.012
- You know what it is?
- Yes.

882
01:43:45.137 --> 01:43:47.431
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

883
01:43:47.514 --> 01:43:48.891
- You're the president?
- Yes.

884
01:43:48.974 --> 01:43:51.226
The president?

885
01:43:52.436 --> 01:43:54.521
Look at me.

886
01:43:54.605 --> 01:43:58.066
Oh, you can't. I'm sorry. How's that?

887
01:44:08.118 --> 01:44:10.370
I'll show you what I got here.

888
01:44:10.454 --> 01:44:12.831
See this? This is a charger.

889
01:44:12.915 --> 01:44:15.834
It's used by convicts
to hide money and drugs.

890
01:44:15.918 --> 01:44:20.839
They stick it in their body, they tuck it
up their rectum. You familiar with that?

891
01:44:20.923 --> 01:44:23.842
This... Look at me. Pencil detonator.

892
01:44:23.926 --> 01:44:28.055
Timer. Used as a receiver, a transmitter.

893
01:44:29.097 --> 01:44:32.142
C4. Highly explosive.

894
01:44:32.225 --> 01:44:34.478
You put 'em all together, you got a bomb.

895
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:39.066
Not very sophisticated, but very powerful.

896
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:41.944
That's what you have in your ass right now.

897
01:44:42.027 --> 01:44:44.237
Don't move. Don't move.

898
01:44:44.321 --> 01:44:45.489
Don't move.

899
01:44:49.701 --> 01:44:51.912
Cheap watch, pager watch,

900
01:44:51.995 --> 01:44:58.085
used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

901
01:44:58.168 --> 01:44:59.336
So...

902
01:44:59.419 --> 01:45:03.298
I'm gonna send you a page
which you will receive...

903
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.928
in five minutes.

904
01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.306
Now...

905
01:45:15.602 --> 01:45:18.522
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down

906
01:45:18.605 --> 01:45:20.941
between your men and the kidnapper.

907
01:45:21.024 --> 01:45:23.276
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

908
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:26.571
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

909
01:45:26.655 --> 01:45:30.242
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

910
01:45:32.327 --> 01:45:36.248
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
Are you sure?

911
01:45:37.249 --> 01:45:39.001
OK.

912
01:45:40.043 --> 01:45:43.380
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

913
01:45:43.463 --> 01:45:46.258
- Relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

914
01:45:46.341 --> 01:45:48.802
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

915
01:45:48.885 --> 01:45:53.724
- I saw the opportunity, and I got lucky.
- And?

916
01:45:53.807 --> 01:45:56.893
And I had my men ready,
as we got instructions where to go.

917
01:45:56.977 --> 01:46:01.356
You had your men ready to steal the drop,
ready to kill one of the kidnappers, yeah?

918
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:02.441
You've done this many times.

919
01:46:02.858 --> 01:46:03.567
What's going on, guys?

920
01:46:05.986 --> 01:46:09.322
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper.
- Bingo, bingo, yeah.

921
01:46:09.406 --> 01:46:11.408
You've done this many times.

922
01:46:11.491 --> 01:46:12.492
Many times, yes.

923
01:46:12.576 --> 01:46:15.912
Yeah. You've killed
many victims too, haven't you?

924
01:46:15.996 --> 01:46:20.167
- We just make out as best we can.
- As best we could?

925
01:46:21.877 --> 01:46:24.046
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

926
01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:28.800
Wait a minute.

927
01:46:28.884 --> 01:46:32.137
- Come on, I have a little gift for you.
- For me?

928
01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:35.515
- Yeah, come on.
- What have you got?

929
01:46:35.599 --> 01:46:39.394
There was no $10 million.
There was two and a half in the bags.

930
01:46:39.478 --> 01:46:43.398
The ransom was $10 million.
They put it in two bags, 5 million in each bag.

931
01:46:43.482 --> 01:46:47.819
Two bags, true, but one has half paper,

932
01:46:47.903 --> 01:46:50.363
the other only paper.

933
01:46:51.406 --> 01:46:53.658
Maybe your men stole it.

934
01:46:53.742 --> 01:46:57.954
No, no. Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

935
01:46:59.956 --> 01:47:01.416
OK.

936
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:05.087
At the Ramos house, before the exchange,

937
01:47:05.170 --> 01:47:08.090
who put the bags into the car?

938
01:47:08.173 --> 01:47:10.133
- Guess what.
- What?

939
01:47:10.217 --> 01:47:13.428
Ramos' lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.

940
01:47:30.987 --> 01:47:33.740
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry for the girl.

941
01:47:33.824 --> 01:47:35.700
It was just business, you know?

942
01:47:41.289 --> 01:47:43.917
Everybody keeps saying that to me.

943
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.588
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it.
Do you understand me?

944
01:47:51.383 --> 01:47:53.635
What are you going to do now?

945
01:47:53.718 --> 01:47:55.804
What am I gonna do? Leave. I gotta go.

946
01:47:55.887 --> 01:47:59.057
Go? Hey, come on, come on.
What about me?

947
01:47:59.141 --> 01:48:01.601
What about you? You got 40 seconds.

948
01:48:01.685 --> 01:48:03.228
- Come on.
- 35!

949
01:48:03.311 --> 01:48:05.897
Give me a last wish, please, please.

950
01:48:05.981 --> 01:48:08.859
Last wish? I wish...

951
01:48:08.942 --> 01:48:11.987
you had more time.

952
01:49:01.786 --> 01:49:05.332
JORDAN KALFUS RESIDENCE

953
01:50:22.492 --> 01:50:25.245
- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?

954
01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:29.332
I got something like banking codes
from Bankcoast in the Cayman Islands.

955
01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:32.794
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

956
01:50:32.877 --> 01:50:34.462
Jordan Kalfus.

957
01:50:34.546 --> 01:50:41.428
It looks like US deposits and withdrawals.
Give me the same thing on Samuel Ramos.

958
01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:43.179
- That's it?
- That's it.

959
01:50:44.347 --> 01:50:45.015
OK.

960
01:51:30.852 --> 01:51:33.313
Creasy.

961
01:51:33.396 --> 01:51:35.273
- Samuel.
- Honey?

962
01:51:41.112 --> 01:51:43.448
What's goin' on?

963
01:51:43.531 --> 01:51:45.700
That's what I wanna know.

964
01:51:46.785 --> 01:51:48.161
What is goin' on?

965
01:51:50.163 --> 01:51:52.248
Sam?

966
01:51:53.541 --> 01:51:58.713
I'm gonna ask your wife
a couple of questions, OK? You move...

967
01:51:58.797 --> 01:52:01.091
You make one sound...

968
01:52:02.050 --> 01:52:07.138
and I'll snatch the life right out of you,
you understand?

969
01:52:11.226 --> 01:52:13.395
What happened, Lisa?

970
01:52:14.938 --> 01:52:19.275
Were you in on this,
or was it just your husband?

971
01:52:19.359 --> 01:52:21.319
- Am I in on what?
- You know what.

972
01:52:21.403 --> 01:52:24.072
Pita's kidnapping, her death.
Were you a part of it?

973
01:52:24.155 --> 01:52:27.534
- Pita got killed because the ransom...
- Shut up!

974
01:52:28.785 --> 01:52:31.287
Yeah, the money was stolen, you're right.

975
01:52:31.371 --> 01:52:37.043
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen? $2.5 million, right?

976
01:52:37.127 --> 01:52:40.171
- What are you talkin' about?
- He knows what I'm talkin' about.

977
01:52:40.255 --> 01:52:42.966
- That's what Victor got.
- What are you talkin' about?

978
01:52:43.049 --> 01:52:46.886
2.5 million.
2.5 million to your lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

979
01:52:46.970 --> 01:52:53.393
He put it in an account in the Cayman Islands,
but he won't get a chance to spend it.

980
01:52:54.102 --> 01:52:56.396
What happened to the other five, Sam?

981
01:52:56.479 --> 01:52:58.148
That's 2.5, 2.5.

982
01:52:58.231 --> 01:53:01.443
What is five from ten? Five.
What happened to the other five?

983
01:53:01.526 --> 01:53:03.361
Tell your wife. This is your chance.

984
01:53:03.445 --> 01:53:05.447
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't.

985
01:53:05.530 --> 01:53:08.324
You'll never know how hard it is
to tell your wife the truth.

986
01:53:08.408 --> 01:53:11.327
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

987
01:53:11.411 --> 01:53:15.707
- It was in this room that my father...
- I don't give a fuck about your father!

988
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:19.711
He prayed for his gambling debts
and his infidelities to be forgiven.

989
01:53:19.794 --> 01:53:21.171
- Samuel!
- What?

990
01:53:21.254 --> 01:53:26.050
- I love you! Tell me the truth!
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

991
01:53:26.134 --> 01:53:29.429
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess!

992
01:53:29.512 --> 01:53:32.474
- Tell me what happened to my baby!
- I inherited his lawyer!

993
01:53:32.557 --> 01:53:35.101
Say it! Say it! Say it!

994
01:53:35.185 --> 01:53:37.854
Say it! Be a fuckin' man!

995
01:53:41.441 --> 01:53:45.904
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room
and watch cartoons all day.

996
01:53:45.987 --> 01:53:48.406
And she'd eat ice cream.

997
01:53:48.490 --> 01:53:52.243
And we'd have her back in two days.
He lied to me!

998
01:53:52.327 --> 01:53:55.246
That's why he's fucking dead. I did it!

999
01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:57.415
I did it, Lisa!

1000
01:53:57.999 --> 01:54:00.210
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1001
01:54:00.293 --> 01:54:03.796
I did it for us. For the three of us.

1002
01:54:11.846 --> 01:54:13.932
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1003
01:54:20.313 --> 01:54:22.398
You kill him.

1004
01:54:23.858 --> 01:54:25.652
You kill him, or I will.

1005
01:54:56.849 --> 01:54:59.060
You know how they say a...

1006
01:55:00.436 --> 01:55:03.523
bullet always tells the truth.

1007
01:55:12.490 --> 01:55:14.576
It never lies.

1008
01:55:27.338 --> 01:55:30.341
It didn't work for me, Samuel,

1009
01:55:30.425 --> 01:55:32.510
but maybe...

1010
01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.683
maybe it'll work for you.

1011
01:55:47.317 --> 01:55:48.776
I'll pray for you.

1012
01:57:25.373 --> 01:57:28.710
This is definitely the address
from the ATM card.

1013
01:57:30.294 --> 01:57:33.840
The PIN number was a great locator.

1014
01:57:33.923 --> 01:57:38.594
But there's no one that sounds
anything like The Voice.

1015
01:57:40.596 --> 01:57:43.182
Who's that?

1016
01:57:44.016 --> 01:57:45.351
He's the man.

1017
01:57:45.435 --> 01:57:46.894
The Voice.

1018
01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.772
My guys got into the house...

1019
01:57:51.232 --> 01:57:54.026
on the pretext of giving cholera shots.

1020
01:57:56.738 --> 01:57:59.031
We had to inject the whole barrio.

1021
01:58:01.659 --> 01:58:05.872
We bugged the house
and stole the picture of him.

1022
01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:17.425
Now it's time to pursue him.

1023
01:58:18.468 --> 01:58:21.888
We have to put his photo in
tomorrow's newspaper.

1024
01:58:57.340 --> 01:59:00.343
If you value your life,

1025
01:59:00.468 --> 01:59:03.638
you won't publish those photos.

1026
01:59:19.362 --> 01:59:22.281
- Mr Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

1027
01:59:22.365 --> 01:59:25.576
I traced the PIN for you
and I have an address.

1028
01:59:25.660 --> 01:59:26.452
Yeah?

1029
01:59:26.536 --> 01:59:30.039
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of The Voice.

1030
01:59:30.122 --> 01:59:34.418
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, via Appia.

1031
01:59:34.502 --> 01:59:36.963
- Good.
- And another thing.

1032
01:59:37.046 --> 01:59:39.382
In today's paper is a picture of The Voice.

1033
01:59:39.465 --> 01:59:40.925
FEAR HAS A VOICE.

1034
01:59:41.008 --> 01:59:42.635
Good. Thank you.

1035
02:00:56.667 --> 02:00:57.543
He's in.

1036
02:00:57.627 --> 02:00:59.337
What do we do?

1037
02:00:59.921 --> 02:01:01.047
Nothing. Nothing.

1038
02:01:56.268 --> 02:01:57.687
Out of my house, you son of a bitch!

1039
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:59.188
Stop there!

1040
02:02:47.653 --> 02:02:49.363
Get out. The kids out. Now!

1041
02:02:58.664 --> 02:02:59.915
Sit down.

1042
02:03:03.044 --> 02:03:04.545
Sit down!

1043
02:03:06.881 --> 02:03:08.132
Reina Rosas, yes?

1044
02:03:16.766 --> 02:03:20.019
Who is this? Who is this?

1045
02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:34.700
Daniel.

1046
02:03:34.909 --> 02:03:35.826
Daniel what?

1047
02:03:36.368 --> 02:03:37.536
Daniel Rosas Sanchez.

1048
02:03:39.455 --> 02:03:42.166
The Voice?

1049
02:03:45.795 --> 02:03:47.505
And this is his brother?

1050
02:03:51.258 --> 02:03:52.218
What is his name?

1051
02:03:55.554 --> 02:03:56.597
What is his name?

1052
02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:58.307
Aurelio.

1053
02:03:58.390 --> 02:04:01.102
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez, OK.

1054
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:07.817
OK.

1055
02:04:14.532 --> 02:04:17.326
And you are Daniel's woman, right?

1056
02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:20.663
How do you contact him?

1057
02:04:23.415 --> 02:04:25.417
How do you contact him?

1058
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:27.878
We page him,

1059
02:04:31.382 --> 02:04:33.259
and he calls back on his cellphone.

1060
02:04:36.011 --> 02:04:37.596
Call him.

1061
02:04:49.316 --> 02:04:51.360
There's no signal in here.

1062
02:04:51.443 --> 02:04:53.863
We have to go on the roof.

1063
02:04:56.490 --> 02:04:57.533
Let's go outside.

1064
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:08.544
Outside.

1065
02:05:20.848 --> 02:05:22.016
They're going to get a call.

1066
02:05:23.434 --> 02:05:25.144
Be ready to track him.

1067
02:05:26.103 --> 02:05:29.732
If we're lucky he'll lead us to The Voice.

1068
02:05:51.921 --> 02:05:53.130
Hola, Daniel.

1069
02:05:53.214 --> 02:05:56.675
- Señor Creasy.
- Yeah.

1070
02:05:56.759 --> 02:05:59.261
Yeah, I got your family here.

1071
02:05:59.345 --> 02:06:02.181
Your brother doesn't look too good.

1072
02:06:02.264 --> 02:06:06.352
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months? Yeah?

1073
02:06:07.269 --> 02:06:09.855
You wanna negotiate?

1074
02:06:12.274 --> 02:06:18.697
The most important thing in life is family.
Do you agree?

1075
02:06:20.407 --> 02:06:21.784
I agree.

1076
02:06:23.494 --> 02:06:26.080
There you are, you have my family.

1077
02:06:26.163 --> 02:06:29.041
Well, most of my family.

1078
02:06:29.667 --> 02:06:33.295
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

1079
02:06:33.379 --> 02:06:37.174
Now, tell me seriously,
how much do you want?

1080
02:06:41.387 --> 02:06:44.890
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Here, hold on.

1081
02:06:50.187 --> 02:06:51.438
What the hell do you want?

1082
02:06:53.023 --> 02:06:55.067
Listen to me! Listen!

1083
02:06:55.150 --> 02:06:58.279
I'll take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1084
02:06:58.362 --> 02:07:00.489
Piece by piece! Shut up!

1085
02:07:01.657 --> 02:07:04.451
I don't want your money.

1086
02:07:04.535 --> 02:07:07.413
You understand me? You understand me?

1087
02:07:07.496 --> 02:07:10.082
I want you!

1088
02:07:42.781 --> 02:07:44.658
I'm listening.

1089
02:07:44.742 --> 02:07:48.370
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

1090
02:07:54.126 --> 02:07:57.796
All right. I will give you a life for a life.

1091
02:07:59.381 --> 02:08:01.925
Whose life? What are you talkin' about?

1092
02:08:02.009 --> 02:08:04.845
Whose life, Daniel? I want you!

1093
02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:08.474
I will give you her life. For your life.

1094
02:08:08.557 --> 02:08:12.978
And in exchange, I will get my life back.

1095
02:08:13.062 --> 02:08:18.192
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1096
02:08:20.944 --> 02:08:23.906
- Pita's dead!
- Creasy!

1097
02:08:25.074 --> 02:08:29.495
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing.

1098
02:08:29.578 --> 02:08:30.621
She's alive.

1099
02:08:34.708 --> 02:08:36.794
All right.

1100
02:08:38.670 --> 02:08:44.051
I want proof of life, you hear me?
I want proof of life. I want...

1101
02:08:44.134 --> 02:08:47.513
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1102
02:08:47.596 --> 02:08:52.184
You tell her to tell you to tell me
what she calls her bear.

1103
02:09:03.278 --> 02:09:05.239
Little one...

1104
02:09:05.322 --> 02:09:07.616
What do you call your teddy bear?

1105
02:09:21.547 --> 02:09:23.215
Yeah?

1106
02:09:23.298 --> 02:09:26.927
Creasy. She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

1107
02:09:32.224 --> 02:09:33.559
Remember...

1108
02:09:33.642 --> 02:09:35.811
I will give you her life

1109
02:09:35.894 --> 02:09:37.896
for your life

1110
02:09:38.397 --> 02:09:40.774
and the life of my brother.

1111
02:09:43.193 --> 02:09:45.279
OK.

1112
02:09:46.989 --> 02:09:48.657
OK.

1113
02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:53.662
I give you your brother, you give me the girl.

1114
02:09:53.745 --> 02:09:56.582
- All right.
- Where?

1115
02:10:11.263 --> 02:10:15.642
He left the roof. We lost the signal.

1116
02:10:15.726 --> 02:10:17.269
We got cut off.

1117
02:10:19.188 --> 02:10:21.023
We lost him. We lost him.

1118
02:10:23.317 --> 02:10:24.276
Damn.

1119
02:10:41.418 --> 02:10:44.880
- Hello?
- Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1120
02:10:44.963 --> 02:10:47.049
I think Pita's alive.

1121
02:10:48.967 --> 02:10:51.261
I can't take this any more.

1122
02:10:51.345 --> 02:10:56.225
Take the road to Puebla.
Get off junction 34, south side.

1123
02:10:56.308 --> 02:10:58.393
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1124
02:11:44.314 --> 02:11:46.650
So where is she?

1125
02:11:48.110 --> 02:11:52.489
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1126
02:11:57.786 --> 02:11:59.871
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1127
02:12:01.081 --> 02:12:03.292
Here's his brother.

1128
02:12:05.168 --> 02:12:06.795
Here.

1129
02:12:07.838 --> 02:12:10.591
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

1130
02:12:10.674 --> 02:12:14.970
Anything goes wrong, you put it to his head,

1131
02:12:15.053 --> 02:12:18.140
you pull the trigger, all right?

1132
02:12:18.223 --> 02:12:20.767
You understand?

1133
02:12:23.645 --> 02:12:28.275
You don't let him loose

1134
02:12:28.358 --> 02:12:31.153
until she's with you, you got it?

1135
02:12:34.072 --> 02:12:36.825
And you don't wait for me, OK?

1136
02:12:40.203 --> 02:12:43.373
- Yeah.
- You'll be all right. You OK?

1137
02:12:43.457 --> 02:12:44.958
Yeah.

1138
02:14:30.272 --> 02:14:32.023
Creasy!

1139
02:14:33.608 --> 02:14:35.694
Creasy!

1140
02:14:36.862 --> 02:14:39.406
Creasy!

1141
02:14:56.506 --> 02:14:58.049
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1142
02:14:58.133 --> 02:15:00.886
They didn't hurt you?

1143
02:15:02.387 --> 02:15:04.473
Hi.

1144
02:15:06.016 --> 02:15:10.353
All right, your mother's waiting for you.
She's at the end the bridge.

1145
02:15:10.437 --> 02:15:14.065
- OK, you go home.
- OK.

1146
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:17.068
- All right.
- Where are you going?

1147
02:15:20.530 --> 02:15:22.616
I'm goin' home too.

1148
02:15:24.618 --> 02:15:26.203
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

1149
02:15:33.418 --> 02:15:35.504
I got something for you.

1150
02:15:38.465 --> 02:15:40.634
I got the last number too.

1151
02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:43.553
I love you, Creasy.

1152
02:15:47.098 --> 02:15:49.434
And you love me, don't you?

1153
02:15:49.518 --> 02:15:51.895
Yes, I do.

1154
02:15:51.978 --> 02:15:54.147
Now, come on, Pita, go.

1155
02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:57.275
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

1156
02:16:12.791 --> 02:16:14.125
Pita!

1157
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:16.086
- Mom!
- Baby, come here! It's OK!

1158
02:16:16.169 --> 02:16:17.963
- Mom!
- Come on.

1159
02:16:18.046 --> 02:16:20.715
OK, I'll let you go now.

1160
02:16:20.799 --> 02:16:23.426
Mom!

1161
02:19:46.921 --> 02:19:54.637

DANIEL SANCHEZ "THE VOICE" WAS KILLED
DURING THE COURSE OF ARREST, DEC 16, 2003
