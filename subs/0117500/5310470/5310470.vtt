1
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.239
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

2
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.239
General Hummel,
you've gotta get us outta here now!

3
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.320
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

4
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.079
Goddamn it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

5
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.719
They're lightin' us up like a firestorm!

6
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.959
This is Hummel.
Get my men outta there!

7
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.839
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

8
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.119
They're not coming for us, are they?

9
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.679
Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members

10
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.039
of the Special Armed Services Committee.

11
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.959
I come before you
to protest a grave injustice.

12
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.039
Aim!

13
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.719
It has to stop.

14
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.159
I miss you so much.

15
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.439
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

16
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.439
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

17
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.359
I tried.

18
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.559
You know I tried everything.
And I still don't have their attention.

19
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.159
Let's hope this elevates their thinking.

20
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.399
But whatever happens...

21
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.519
please don't think less of me.

22
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.960
Marine, inform the garrison CO

23
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.719
General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

24
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.039
Yes, sir.
Sir, it's an honour having you, sir.

25
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.359
- About time for a guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

26
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.119
I got the access card. We got 30
minutes till those darts wear off.

27
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.399
Move it!

28
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.839
The access card, sir.

29
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.919
Let's do it.

30
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.079
2400 magazine check.

31
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.079
Go, go.

32
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.799
- Man, it's wet out there.
- Check me through, will ya?

33
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.479
Clear!

34
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.319
- I want 16, major!
- Move it!

35
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.919
Evac!

36
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.279
Seal the door!

37
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.679
- No! No! No!
- Come on, man! Seal it! Seal it!

38
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.679
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here!

39
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.799
Let me out! Let me out!

40
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.919
Clear out. Get outta here!

41
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.359
Sorry.

42
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.719
Let's move out.

43
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.759
Two more cc's of acetylene chloride.

44
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.919
That'll be $5, Isherwood.

45
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.639
You suck.

46
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.519
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

47
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.599
Yes! She's here!
Bring it to me now. Thank you, Phil!

48
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.119
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

49
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.200
Carla wouldn't approve.

50
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.879
She thinks it's dumb
to spend $600 on an LP.

51
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.999
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

52
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.319
First of all, I'm a Beatlemaniac.

53
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.759
And second, these sound better.

54
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.079
Could be serious. Could be sarin gas.

55
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.639
Dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package

56
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.359
postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.
Could be detergent or sarin gas.

57
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.239
- Bosnian refugee camp?
- Half a million Serbians in the US.

58
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.879
- Serbians don't like Bosnians.
- Get suited.

59
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.239
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

60
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.440
We have air lock, Stanley. Set to go.

61
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.599
October 1, 0900 hours.

62
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.479
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood

63
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.959
initiating exam of wooden crate.
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

64
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.519
- Marvin, sarin is a...
- GB aerosol.

65
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.199
That is correct.

66
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.479
Let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

67
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.399
Stone Age Cave Girls in the Raw.

68
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.439
Kinky. And not a good sign.

69
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.319
Hello, little baby doll.
Lookit, Stan.

70
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.719
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin, don't!

71
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.399
Hi, Stan.

72
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.079
Shit! Move back! Move back!

73
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.639
- Powering exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

74
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.959
We'll have that room clear!
You'll be OK.

75
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.319
Jesus Christ!

76
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.679
OK, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

77
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.199
The bad news is the gas is corrosive,
and it's eating our suits.

78
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.279
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news

79
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.799
is there's enough C4 explosive and gas
to blow the chamber and kill everybody.

80
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.959
- Detonation two minutes.
- Out now!

81
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.199
Seal us inside.

82
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.079
- Where are the sprinklers?
- The acid's eating my su...

83
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.439
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

84
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.639
Just wash us off!

85
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.639
- Where are sprinklers?
- Working on it. Flow problem.

86
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.239
That's a pretty big problem.
Fix it now!

87
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.559
- We're working! How much time?
- A minute ten.

88
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.879
- Look!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

89
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.799
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine.

90
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.479
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

91
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.079
Marvin, the atropine, now!

92
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.159
Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

93
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.199
Shit!

94
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.639
- Make him take it too.
- Where's that water?

95
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.879
- Get that away from me!
- Come on, fix it for Christ's sake!

96
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.359
Take the atropine now,
for Christ's sake!

97
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.679
- We're fucked.
- The poison's mixing.

98
00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.919
What the fuck are you waiting for?
You take the fucking needle now!

99
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.519
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

100
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.919
If that suit melts...
If you die, we all die!

101
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.439
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

102
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.559
- Just do it, Stan!
- What if I miss my heart? I can't see!

103
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.039
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.

104
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.679
You want me to stick this into my heart?
Are you fucking nuts?

105
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.079
- All right, it's coming!
- OK, here we go, man!

106
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.479
Sprinkler activated.

107
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.439
How much time left?

108
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.999
Twenty seconds!

109
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.879
We're not gonna make it.

110
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.159
Fifteen.

111
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.399
Come on.

112
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.079
Clear!

113
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.919
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

114
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.039
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

115
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.279
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

116
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.319
Hi, baby.

117
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.479
I had such an interesting day today.

118
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.039
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

119
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.079
Oh, OK, you go first.

120
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.999
Some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies,

121
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.199
which had to be neutralised
before blowing up the office.

122
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.079
So I took the rest of the day off. Glass
of wine, little guitar. Just relaxing.

123
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.799
I mean it, honey.

124
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.439
The world is being
FedEx'd to hell on a handcart.

125
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.759
Anyone who's even thinking
about having a child in this world

126
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.959
is coldly considering an act of cruelty.

127
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.839
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

128
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.119
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

129
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.960
I'm sorry?

130
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.399
I'm pregnant.

131
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.039
- Really?
- Yeah.

132
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.639
Is that all you're gonna say is "wow"?

133
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.119
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

134
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.399
How do you know?
I mean, how do you know?

135
00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.839
Blue! Just turned blue,
so I went to the doctor.

136
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.199
You didn't mean
what you just said, did you?

137
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.559
- When?
- Talking about bringing a child

138
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.799
into the world and having it
be an act of cruelty.

139
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.119
- I meant it at the time.
- At the time?

140
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.239
- Seven and a half seconds ago.
- Well, gosh!

141
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.359
A lot's happened since then.
We're not even married.

142
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.399
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

143
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.199
- It's funny?
- Do you love me?

144
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.479
- Of course I love you.
- Good.

145
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.399
- Will you marry me?
- Wait.

146
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.559
- Hey, marriage police, pull over.
- Come on, Stanley.

147
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.759
I'm proposing to you right now.

148
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.719
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

149
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.279
Is it true that there's
never been an escape?

150
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.399
That's true. From 1936 until '63,
when the prison closed,

151
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.239
there were 14 attempts.

152
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.279
No one is believed to have
made it to shore, alive at least.

153
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.839
Hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
tourists are not allowed here.

154
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.319
- I don't really give a shit! Do you?
- No.

155
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.559
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

156
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.279
- Hey, girls? You havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

157
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.239
Will you do something for me?
It's really important.

158
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.839
Tell your teacher you need
to get back on the boat and go home now.

159
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.359
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

160
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.079
This cell block housed
the most awesome scum in America.

161
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.759
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,

162
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.359
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

163
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.199
On the line!

164
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.559
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they?
Like being a caged animal.

165
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.280
Spend a couple of years in there...

166
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.719
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Tour's over, Bob.

167
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.919
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

168
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.959
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

169
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.599
Welcome to The Rock. Land the choppers
on the back side and deploy.

170
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.959
Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

171
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.239
- I'm not allowed to carry a gun.
- You're not allowed?

172
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.039
I got a gun. If I'd have known
this was gonna happen,

173
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.199
I'd have brought my fuckin' gun!
Help!

174
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.679
This'll be our new home. Tom,
I want my command centre right here.

175
00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.479
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

176
00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.759
Satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

177
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.999
Let's move it.

178
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.999
Systems up.

179
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.679
Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

180
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.159
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch.

181
00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.919
It's an anti-motion trembler device.
It's custom-made.

182
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.679
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

183
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.879
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

184
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.999
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

185
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.600
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're being detained against your will.

186
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.879
For that, I apologise. It is not our
intention in any way to harm you.

187
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.280
You will not be detained longer than
necessary to complete our mission.

188
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.919
Attention on deck!

189
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.719
Stand easy, men.

190
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.039
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,
we are now in harm's way.

191
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.359
For Baxter and I,
this is the last campaign

192
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.679
in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

193
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.399
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Sergeant Crisp,

194
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:22.999
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

195
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.759
Frye, Darrow, my first operational
situation with you and your men.

196
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.359
Thus far, conduct
reflects your reputations.

197
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.319
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

198
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.919
We achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

199
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.839
To this we must now add resolve.

200
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.239
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

201
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.039
Punishable by death.

202
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.399
A couple hundred years ago,

203
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.119
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams

204
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.159
were branded as traitors by the British.

205
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.159
And now they're called patriots.

206
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.239
In time, so shall we.

207
00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.359
God willing, in less than 48 hours,
you will evacuate this island

208
00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.279
in gunships under cover of hostages
and VX gas warheads.

209
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.719
Your destination,
a non-extradition treaty country.

210
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.119
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

211
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.639
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

212
00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.719
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

213
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.759
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected to carry out

214
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.279
illegal operations throughout the world.

215
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.599
When they don't come home,

216
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.079
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them

217
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.239
and denied compensation.

218
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.559
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

219
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.199
Well, here and now, the lies stop!

220
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.359
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

221
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.359
This is FBI Director Womack.

222
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.639
Director, be advised.

223
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.439
Eighty-one, I say again,

224
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.199
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

225
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.519
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

226
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.959
Who is this?

227
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.679
Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

228
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.959
A battery of VX gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver

229
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.599
a lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay Area.

230
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.279
I will call at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

231
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.879
I want to know who's talking.

232
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.239
Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel,
US Marine Corps, from Alcatraz. Out!

233
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.239
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

234
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.039
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

235
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.839
Last night, Hummel, using brutal
but non-lethal force,

236
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.079
under the guise of a security exercise,
walked off with 15 poison gas rockets.

237
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.959
He lost one of his own men.

238
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.639
General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

239
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.759
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

240
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.399
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars
and the Congressional Medal of...

241
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.319
Jesus! This man is a hero!

242
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.039
Legend might be a better description.

243
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.559
Now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

244
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.239
Mr. Sinclair,
General Hummel is a man of honour.

245
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.079
General, it's him.

246
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.679
- Frank, it's Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al, how you doin'?

247
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.119
I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me.

248
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.919
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

249
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.759
I'll come straight to the point.

250
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.159
83 Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my commands.

251
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.599
47 in northern Laos
and southern China.

252
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.759
China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

253
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.999
Who is this? Identify yourself.

254
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.839
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair.

255
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.319
- How old are you, Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

256
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.719
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

257
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.399
By your ninth birthday,
I was runnin' black ops

258
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.959
and my men were responsible
for over 200 kills.

259
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.719
Al, put some rigging tape over
Mr. Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.

260
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.319
- You want to continue, Frank?
- Remember Operation Desert Storm?

261
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.119
Those surgical hits made by our smart
bombs, covered so well on CNN?

262
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.719
It was my men on the ground that made
those hits possible by lasing targets.

263
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.119
Twenty were left to rot outside
Baghdad after conflict ended.

264
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.119
No benefits paid to their families.

265
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.079
No medals conferred.

266
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.599
These men died for their country, and
they weren't given a military burial.

267
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.959
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million

268
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.959
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading
Company to an account I designate.

269
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.839
From this, reparations
of $1 million will be paid

270
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.199
to each of the 83 Marines' families.

271
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.679
The rest of the funds,
I will disperse at my discretion.

272
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.880
Do I make myself clear?

273
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.159
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

274
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.119
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack.

275
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.679
A slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms.

276
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.199
Jesus!
This is classified information.

277
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.559
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

278
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.519
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

279
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.919
40 hours,
till noon day after tomorrow,

280
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.839
to transfer the money.
I am aware of countermeasure.

281
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.399
You know and I know it doesn't stand
a chance. Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

282
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.239
All right.

283
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.359
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

284
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.559
Tell 'em something. Make up a story,
keep this undercover.

285
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.759
This comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be in chaos.

286
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.279
- I am talking anarchy.
- Wait a minute.

287
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:39.479
What is the potential casualty rate
for a single rocket

288
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.079
armed with VX poison gas,
General Peterson?

289
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.279
- Sixty or 70.
- Well, that's not so bad.

290
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.279
Thousand.

291
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.359
Seventy thousand dead!

292
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.479
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

293
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.080
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere

294
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.079
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius. Get the point?

295
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.199
What did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure?

296
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.439
Poison is countered by napalm.
Burns it, consumes it upon detonation.

297
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.999
The problem with VX poison gas
is that it's designed specifically

298
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.279
to withstand napalm. That's where
thermite plasma comes in. General?

299
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.159
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume VX,

300
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.599
but they're still in the test phase.
It's not operational.

301
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.959
Hummel knows this. We are dealing
with one smart son of a bitch.

302
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.839
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma

303
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.479
- within the next 36 hours?
- An act of God.

304
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.799
- Excuse me?
- All right, we can try.

305
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.319
I urge you to consider the use of this
as a secondary initiative.

306
00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.559
Go to our primary initiative. Admiral?

307
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.039
Bring in our SEAL ground commander,
Commander Anderson.

308
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.479
Mr. Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

309
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.399
- That's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.

310
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.999
That's very compelling.

311
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.839
- You like my pigtails?
- Yeah, the pigtails are naughty.

312
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.639
Naughty. Naughty.

313
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.879
You're just an amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

314
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.519
- This isn't happening.
- Stan, don't answer it.

315
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.519
- This isn't happening!
- Just don't answer it. It's OK.

316
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.199
I have to. It's the office.
They know I'm home.

317
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.359
How could they know
that you're home?

318
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.759
It's the FBI.

319
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.919
Stanley!

320
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.000
Goodspeed. Yeah. OK, yeah.

321
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.840
- I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
- No, you won't.

322
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.119
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

323
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.359
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

324
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.159
Are you kidding me?
Stay here and talk to me.

325
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.919
- I've got to go, baby.
- I am Catholic! Do you realise that?

326
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.839
I am pregnant and I am unmarried.
This causes a serious problem for me.

327
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.839
I cannot believe you.

328
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.319
No, no.

329
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.679
I love you. I will marry you.

330
00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.399
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

331
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.199
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

332
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.399
I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

333
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.599
Check into the hotel.
Order champagne.

334
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.720
- Finish what we started?
- Exactly.

335
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.039
- You're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

336
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.039
You're gonna marry me!

337
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.599
- Honey, come on. Just a quick one.
- I gotta go now.

338
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.839
Night-time airdrop incursion
is out due to full moon.

339
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.719
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.
If shots are fired, Hummel might launch.

340
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.639
Our alternative
is an attack from within the prison.

341
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.079
We penetrate through tunnels
under the buildings undetected

342
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.159
and emerge in its centre.
We jump Marines from behind,

343
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.679
and if we're lucky, take
rocket positions without a shot fired.

344
00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.159
- You've studied architectural plans?
- They're useless.

345
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:06.959
Alcatraz has been ripped up
and rebuilt for years.

346
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.999
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- There's no question.

347
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.439
We need intelligence of the tunnels.

348
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.719
- What about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

349
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.599
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

350
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.719
There is someone
who I think can help us.

351
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.799
- For the sake of national security.
- No!

352
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.639
It's the sake of national security
that got us here in the first place.

353
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.279
I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

354
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.079
Forget it! He does not exist.

355
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.479
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

356
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.759
- We locked him up.
- A lot of goddamn good it did us.

357
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.279
He broke out of two prisons.
If he hits the streets...

358
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.679
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

359
00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.599
Thirty years ago, he was
a trained SAS operative.

360
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.239
He is my age now! I have to get up
three times a night to take a piss.

361
00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.679
We can't risk letting him out.

362
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.439
He's a professional escape artist.

363
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.159
- Gosh. Neat...
- Yeah.

364
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.799
- Neat plane.
- Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

365
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.879
- A pleasure. Thank you.
- Welcome.

366
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.759
You come highly recommended.
BA, Columbia, MA, PhD, Johns Hopkins.

367
00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.999
Biochemistry, toxicology.

368
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.359
I'm one of those people
who like my job, sir.

369
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.319
First chemistry set at seven.
Blew my eyebrows off.

370
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.079
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

371
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.439
- What do you know about VX gas?
- Liquid.

372
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.279
Failed pesticide discovered
by a mistake in 1952.

373
00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.399
Like champagne.
Monks thought they were making wine.

374
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.919
The bottle carbonated.
Voilà! Champagne...

375
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.919
The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

376
00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.919
It's very, very horrible, sir.

377
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.599
One of those things
we wish we could dis-invent.

378
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.959
This isn't a training exercise, is it?

379
00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.319
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

380
00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.879
Good morning, director.

381
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.639
Ernest Paxton, in charge
of West Coast operation.

382
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.879
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

383
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.599
- How do you do?
- It's been an interesting day.

384
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.919
The prisoner's here. Shall we?

385
00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:14.919
My boys haven't been able to find a file
on this guy. Who is he anyway, sir?

386
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.919
His name is John Mason,

387
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.799
a British national incarcerated
on Alcatraz in 1962.

388
00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.080
Escaped in '63.

389
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.679
I was under the impression
no one ever escaped.

390
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.519
Paxton, don't argue.

391
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.599
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

392
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.959
He does not exist. Understand?

393
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.439
I want one thing,
how he escaped The Rock.

394
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.719
The route through the island's bowels.

395
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.839
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer a pardon.

396
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.080
And, Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

397
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.519
If you know him,
why don't you question him?

398
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.079
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

399
00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.759
I'll take care of him.

400
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.639
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge Ernest Paxton.

401
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.839
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

402
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.999
I don't know about previous matters.

403
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.439
I'm here because a situation exists
you might be able to help us with.

404
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.039
What might that be? I've been in jail
longer than Nelson Mandela,

405
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.399
so maybe you want me
to run for president.

406
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.400
- Not exactly.
- A pity.

407
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.439
- I feel rather like Alcamenes.
- Who?

408
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.919
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in Ancient Greece.

409
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.919
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh. Same fate.
- James I.

410
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.319
Even someone as bright
as you must be aware

411
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.919
that there's
a certain pattern emerging here.

412
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.639
- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?
- Yeah, I heard of him.

413
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.919
He play hockey
for the fuckin' Red Wings?

414
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.279
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight.

415
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.999
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

416
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.399
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

417
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.599
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

418
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.359
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

419
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.479
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

420
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.759
- A hostage situation on Alcatraz.
- Hostage?

421
00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.919
- Eighty-one tourists.
- The Rock is a tourist attraction?

422
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.959
Why don't we cut the shit.
You know The Rock.

423
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.199
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

424
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.319
Yeah. Do yourself a favour
while you're helpin' us.

425
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.679
It'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

426
00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.319
While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

427
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.599
While I'm considering your offer,

428
00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.919
I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.

429
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.559
You know, I'm here to cut you a deal.

430
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:46.799
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

431
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.159
Here. Here's a quarter.

432
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.919
Do yourself a favour. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

433
00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.559
- You're sending him back?
- Not sending him anywhere.

434
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.799
I'm givin' him somethin'
to think about.

435
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.119
All due respect,
I don't think we have time

436
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.879
- to sit and think.
- Really?

437
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.439
No, Goodspeed's right.
You go talk to him.

438
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.599
- Me?
- Yes.

439
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.199
- I'm not qualified.
- You're an FBI agent!

440
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.319
- Your specialty?
- Chemical weapons.

441
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.279
Don't mention that.

442
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.719
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

443
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:34.479
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

444
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.639
OK.

445
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.760
Hi.

446
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.159
I'm an agent with the Federal... FBI.

447
00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.119
- Well, I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

448
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.839
At least he got his name right.

449
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.279
- Of course I am.
- And you have an emergency.

450
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:02.359
That's right.

451
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.279
- And you need my help.
- Exactly right.

452
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.159
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

453
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.399
Offer me coffee.

454
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.679
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

455
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.479
Can we get a cup
of coffee in here, please?

456
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.319
And offer to take these off.

457
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.599
Mr. Mason, really.

458
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.119
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

459
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.719
Prisoner requests
to have his handcuffs taken off.

460
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.519
No, no, no, no.

461
00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.839
Go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off.

462
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.359
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

463
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.519
This is a pardon and release
from the attorney general's office.

464
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:52.279
Now, it makes you a free man,
provided you cooperate.

465
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.999
So if you'll just sign...

466
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.679
- at where it says...
- Signature?

467
00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.399
That's... Yes. Signature.

468
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.799
I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts.

469
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.319
An educated man.

470
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.159
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

471
00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.119
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

472
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.359
- Really?
- Yes.

473
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.119
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

474
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.119
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

475
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.159
Well trained.

476
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.359
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

477
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.759
- OK.
- I want a suite,

478
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.999
a shower, a shave
and the feel of a suit.

479
00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.359
- May I also suggest... a haircut?
- Am I out of style?

480
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.399
Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

481
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.599
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

482
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.559
Yeah, well...
OK, thank you very much.

483
00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.359
All right. Call the Fairmont.

484
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.439
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

485
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.239
And he gets two hours max.

486
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.479
Great job, Goodspeed.

487
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.679
Why didn't you throw
in a trip to Tahiti?

488
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.839
- I'll deliver this.
- No, you'll give it to me.

489
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.879
Take Attorney Reynolds outside.
There's a car waiting. Thank you.

490
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.079
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

491
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.599
You're not acquainted
with the full facts.

492
00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.719
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

493
00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.919
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

494
00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.999
It's... It's kind of curious, but...

495
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.399
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn, they...

496
00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.519
Well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

497
00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.479
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit?

498
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.439
Peace! Peace!

499
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.279
We're not home. Leave a message.

500
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.959
Hi, darling, it's... it's me.

501
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.079
Listen, don't come to San Francisco.
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

502
00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.639
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.

503
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.959
- Like hell I'm not coming!
- Wait. Carla?

504
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.599
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

505
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.199
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

506
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.479
Watch it, he'll bite you.

507
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.519
Good. Mobile command
is fully operational.

508
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.999
We'll be there
in approximately two hours.

509
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.879
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

510
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.599
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

511
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.719
I left it in my... my sock drawer.

512
00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.559
A gun?

513
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.599
For what? You're a chemical freak.

514
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:26.559
No, I'm a chemical superfreak actually.
But I still need a gun.

515
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.679
Give him a goddamn gun.

516
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.439
Have you fired one of those things
since the academy?

517
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.439
Room service? Listen.

518
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.719
This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks?

519
00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.959
Hello!

520
00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.439
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

521
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.839
Barber.

522
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.199
Just clippers. No scissors.

523
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.759
You've got to be kidding me,
no scissors!

524
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.839
- Did they tell Picasso, no brush?
- Scissors, this man could kill you.

525
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.319
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer, now, can I?

526
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.719
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

527
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.599
Who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

528
00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.359
- Well, it's a grunge thing.
- Well, it's some kind of thing.

529
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.519
Do we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and some colour?

530
00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.319
- No.
- OK.

531
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.839
- Not very nice, is he?
- No, he's not.

532
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.559
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

533
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.119
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?
- Not when it's free.

534
00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.439
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Don't worry. He's an old man.

535
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.919
The boss is watchin' him.
Try this lobster.

536
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.679
My secretary here will settle the bill.

537
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.039
So, what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

538
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.800
You'll get your life back.

539
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.399
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

540
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.639
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

541
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.559
Will you shake on it?

542
00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.559
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

543
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.879
Help!

544
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.119
Drop the gun, or I drop your boss.

545
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.519
You will not!

546
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.839
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

547
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.159
Please don't!

548
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.599
Help! Shit!

549
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:24.359
Come on. Have a scallop.
Come on. Catch.

550
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.759
You hoist him in!

551
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.519
Help! Help! Help!

552
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.359
- Where's Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

553
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.319
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!

554
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.639
Gone?

555
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.839
Clear.

556
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.319
Living room's clear!

557
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.399
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

558
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.479
This is Caretaker.
Signal six. He's in the hotel!

559
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.119
I don't wanna know nothin'.

560
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.639
I never saw you throw him
off the balcony.

561
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.479
All I care about is,
are you happy with your haircut?

562
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.279
Easy!

563
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.439
Watch it, you fuckhead!
You're gonna pull my arm out!

564
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.959
Watch out!

565
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.880
Watch it!

566
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.320
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

567
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.600
Hey!

568
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.559
This is my Humvee. I don't want
dings, dents or scratches,

569
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.239
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

570
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.439
Hey! Stop! Hey!

571
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.439
I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

572
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.239
Hey, call the guard! Go!

573
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.519
FBI.

574
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.439
Move!

575
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.439
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

576
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.679
Speed approximately 70 miles per hour.

577
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.679
Get out of the way!

578
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.279
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, hear me?

579
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.799
This guy's hittin' everything
in sight to block us!

580
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.319
I hope you're insured!

581
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.679
Oh, well. Why not?

582
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.839
You're goin' down!

583
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.879
Hello?

584
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.919
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

585
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.279
Information? San Francisco?

586
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.239
Jade Angelou. That's A-N-G...

587
00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:24.599
Welcome aboard.
How y'all doin' today?

588
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.519
Hang on!

589
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.600
Holy shit!

590
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.960
Oh, no!

591
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.079
We're gonna crash! Save yourselves!

592
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.599
Oh, my baby!

593
00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.559
Oh, no!

594
00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.599
Oh, no.

595
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.240
Oh, God!

596
00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.919
Oh, God!

597
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.399
Hey, man, you just
fucked up your Ferrari.

598
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.519
- Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

599
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.519
Neither is this!

600
00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.639
Damn! This sucks!

601
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.599
Where's that son of a bitch at?
I'm gonna hunt him down!

602
00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.879
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

603
00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.319
Chem weapons. Isherwood.

604
00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.759
Marvin, look up
Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

605
00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.759
The inmate is Mason, John.

606
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.759
Listen. I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

607
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.559
Goin' to Orkin
to design roach motels. Cool, huh?

608
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.759
I stole a kid's motorcycle.
I'm not feeling too good.

609
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.679
- Wolfburg! Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

610
00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:33.959
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

611
00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.479
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

612
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:44.599
Weird. They got medical records.
They got place of birth. Glasgow.

613
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.639
But they don't have a name.

614
00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:53.479
Wait a minute. Next of kin. Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

615
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.359
- Jade?
- No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

616
00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.839
- Were you afraid to come alone?
- Yeah.

617
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.559
- It's OK.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

618
00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.479
The last photograph I had of you,
you were about ten.

619
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.279
Yeah?

620
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.479
Well, I found a picture of you among
my mom's things when she died.

621
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.399
Oh, yeah? Well...

622
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.639
Why don't we take a walk?

623
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.479
I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

624
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.439
Your mother... Yeah, well,
she was very special.

625
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.759
Yeah, she was.

626
00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.719
I don't think we should romanticise
what happened between you and her.

627
00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.159
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

628
00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.359
Head out, and I was the result.

629
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.359
I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only...

630
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.639
If only what? Six marshals
hadn't kicked down our door

631
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.919
and dragged you back to prison?

632
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.479
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

633
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.759
- So they let you out?
- Yeah.

634
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.920
That's good.

635
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800
What did you do?

636
00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:40.759
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

637
00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:44.239
But I'll be coming back. And...

638
00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.799
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

639
00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.639
You know, you're almost
the only evidence

640
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.959
that I exist.

641
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.759
- But I don't know you.
- That's what I want to change.

642
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.679
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

643
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.959
Here we are, and I'm lost.

644
00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.359
Well, I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling either.

645
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.079
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

646
00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.439
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

647
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.479
OK.

648
00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.999
Is this about you?

649
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.799
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?

650
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.479
- Why did you come to me?
- FBI. Your father's working with us.

651
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.879
Helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

652
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.159
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

653
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.159
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin'.

654
00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.759
Whatever you say, Stanley.

655
00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.839
Thank you.
Could've handled it differently.

656
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.160
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

657
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:25.119
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

658
00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.839
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

659
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.279
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons

660
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.079
and caged for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

661
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.479
You wrecked half the city!

662
00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.999
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.
- If you know the system,

663
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.519
it will take you
wherever you need to go.

664
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.759
There's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

665
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.999
Yes. That's exactly where I came out.

666
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.559
Beneath the cistern, there's
a connection to the septic system.

667
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.279
- How many feet is that?
- Fifty-seven paces.

668
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.399
Where do we go from there?

669
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.679
Where do we go from there, huh?

670
00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.040
That's a good question.

671
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:17.319
- I have no idea.
- What?

672
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.559
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

673
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.839
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

674
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.879
I can't! My blueprint was in my head.

675
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.839
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

676
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.079
just waiting for the tides to be right.

677
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:37.239
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

678
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.840
- You're not going anywhere, Mason.
- Wait a second.

679
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.919
This piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have.

680
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.719
If he's not going,
why did we get him out of jail?

681
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:50.279
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you people in,

682
00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.399
- not go with you.
- If it's the only way

683
00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.119
of getting the intelligence I need,
then he goes.

684
00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.919
He'll fuck with you.

685
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:01.919
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

686
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.359
Now, Womack,

687
00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.279
you're between The Rock
and a hard case.

688
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.239
How is your bowling arm?

689
00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.359
The goal is to take out the launchers,
then neutralise VX chemical rounds.

690
00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.479
We know the poison's
kept in the morgue

691
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.279
from the satellite thermal imaging,
which is these colourised dots.

692
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.399
Have you seen one of these devices?

693
00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.439
No, sir, but I've studied them.

694
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.879
I should begin briefing
on defusing and detoxification.

695
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.559
Got a layout of the chem
as well as the rocket,

696
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.239
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

697
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.919
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

698
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.359
The power of this chemical
is beyond anything you can imagine.

699
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.559
An ecological disaster, sir.
Plus, the devices are complicated.

700
00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.159
That's why you're coming.

701
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.119
- I am?
- You're the expert.

702
00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.839
What's your problem?

703
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.319
You mean I'm going...
going out there, under the water?

704
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.679
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.

705
00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.879
Now, you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

706
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.919
Ever been in a combat situation?

707
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.039
- Define combat, sir.
- Shep?

708
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.799
An incursion to
retake an impregnable fortress

709
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.679
held by a team of Marines
in possession of 81 hostages

710
00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:23.719
and 15 guided rockets
armed with VX poison gas.

711
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:26.359
In that case, no, sir. Excuse me.

712
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.719
- Here.
- Thank you.

713
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.239
You don't look too good.

714
00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.119
In fact, you look like shit.

715
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.640
My stomach's doing
hula hoops around my ass.

716
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:49.879
You all right? I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?

717
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.679
I don't know.

718
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.639
I expected something
like this was going to happen,

719
00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.479
but nothing prepares you for it.
Now, I'm... I'm responsible

720
00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.599
for a whole city.

721
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.999
I know this isn't easy for you.

722
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.319
You were trained for this situation.

723
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.279
Believe me, it'll come back to you.

724
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.959
You got the best SEAL team
backing you up.

725
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:17.959
OK. You're right.

726
00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.519
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

727
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.039
There's something else.

728
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.880
It's terrible. No, it's wonderful,

729
00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.399
except it isn't.

730
00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.359
My girlfriend's pregnant,

731
00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.599
and she's just flown in to see me.

732
00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.319
Keep your mind
on what you're doing tonight.

733
00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:44.399
I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her here.

734
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.039
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

735
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.919
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

736
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:06.799
Frank, we're havin' a few problems
with the account transfer.

737
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.319
Don't tell me problems.
Tell me solutions.

738
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.359
We spoke to the president.
You're aware of his stance on terrorism.

739
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.639
- We'd like to...
- This isn't about terrorism.

740
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.599
This is about justice.

741
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.279
Reminding you who found it
convenient to forget.

742
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.159
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank.
- Then let me tell you what is.

743
00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.119
Fifteen gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

744
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:29.119
You got 17 hours to deliver money.

745
00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.879
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

746
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.439
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us

747
00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.479
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

748
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.239
That is the word.

749
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.959
Green light to SEAL incursion.

750
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.599
Fall in! All right, listen up.

751
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.599
Mr. Mason will run point for us.
Shepard will be attached to his hip.

752
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.719
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps. Understood?

753
00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.879
Goodspeed is our specialist.
He neutralises the threat,

754
00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:28.599
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

755
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:32.399
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives,

756
00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.559
against the greatest battalion commander
in the Vietnam War. I shit you not.

757
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.199
Any questions?

758
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.119
Let's load up!

759
00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.719
After you, ace.

760
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.399
Pass out and activate the minicams.

761
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.439
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

762
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.839
Roger that, sir. We are online.

763
00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.079
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

764
00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.079
Let's see. We have...

765
00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:41.999
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

766
00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.399
Three washers and waterproof matches.

767
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.799
Use green flares to signal
when the threat's neutralised.

768
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.919
This is atropine.
Come in contact with gas, 20 seconds

769
00:58:56.080 --> 00:59:00.319
to inject it into your heart. Don't fuck
with me on this. It may save your life.

770
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:09.519
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275. Range 6,000 metres.

771
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.319
FBI command centre?

772
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.079
I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

773
00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.599
- Nope.
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

774
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:22.399
Actually, he's my fiancé.

775
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.279
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

776
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.239
OK. You just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead.

777
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.479
Hey, where are you...? Goddamn it!

778
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.799
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

779
00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.479
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

780
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.079
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

781
00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.479
Shit!

782
00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.999
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

783
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.199
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my résumé?

784
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.959
I don't...
I don't know anything about you.

785
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.839
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

786
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.399
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell...

787
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.119
You never went
to any antiterrorist school.

788
01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.039
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

789
01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.680
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

790
01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.599
Raider One has dropped below radar
coverage around Treasure Island.

791
01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.639
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

792
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.999
Decoys?

793
01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.959
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, commander.

794
01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.719
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

795
01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.039
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
He can't even snorkel.

796
01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.399
- Everyone good to go?
- Good to go!

797
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.399
- Good to go!
- Good to go!

798
01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.119
Good to go!

799
01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.839
SDU's have been deployed,
Eagles are in the water.

800
01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.279
I want perimeter patrolled
to the west end. Double-time.

801
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.679
- Yes, sir. Hendrix! Lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

802
01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.199
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

803
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.719
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

804
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.199
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You've led us into a room with no exit.

805
01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.119
Any ideas, Dillinger?

806
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.399
- Figure it out. We're sitting ducks.
- We're tight on time.

807
01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.599
You stand by the door until I open it.

808
01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.759
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

809
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.639
Through here.

810
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.159
- You're shitting me.
- I memorised the timing.

811
01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.119
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

812
01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.079
You catch one of those flame bursts,
you're a corpse.

813
01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.479
Thank you.

814
01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.319
- You said never leave his sight...
- Stand fast, lieutenant.

815
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.559
Have a nice day.

816
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.199
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

817
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.039
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

818
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.759
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

819
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.359
Sweep forward!

820
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.479
Looks like he fucked us, commander.

821
01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.079
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

822
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.279
Welcome to The Rock.

823
01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.159
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

824
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.719
That's the subway.
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

825
01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.039
Do it!

826
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.719
Sir, the Eagles
have breached the tunnel system.

827
01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.559
You enjoying this?

828
01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.759
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable
than my average day.

829
01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:17.879
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

830
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.079
Though it's less of a problem these days.
Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

831
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:29.439
Seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

832
01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.199
Continue patrolling the area.

833
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.839
Sweep forward!

834
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.559
Commander, halt. We've got movement.

835
01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:41.959
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

836
01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.359
Down, down, down.

837
01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.399
West storm drain's clear.

838
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:59.919
Ninety-seven paces to the shower room.

839
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.319
The Eagles are at the tunnel.
Right under the shower room.

840
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.799
Fibre optics.

841
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.879
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

842
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.519
Quiet.

843
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:53.639
Motion sensors.

844
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.759
- Beams cutting across manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

845
01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.519
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

846
01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.399
Possibly a prism.

847
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.679
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam,

848
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.879
send the beam back to its source,
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

849
01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.479
Motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

850
01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.679
We got visitors. Let's move.

851
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.640
Got it. Good to go.

852
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.599
Fuck, man!
I knew this would happen! Fuck!

853
01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.079
Move!

854
01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.359
Stand fast. We'll secure the area.

855
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.719
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

856
01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.759
They're securing the area.

857
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:09.399
Just sit tight.

858
01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.119
Drop your weapons! Drop 'em!

859
01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:18.319
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

860
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.479
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

861
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.839
It's a fucking trap.

862
01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.280
This is General Hummel.
Drop your weapons!

863
01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.639
- Drop 'em!
- Anderson here, General Hummel.

864
01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.559
Commander. Team leader.

865
01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.639
Commander, if you have concern
for the lives of your men,

866
01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.519
safety their weapons
and place them on the deck.

867
01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.599
- This is not happening.
- Sir, we know why you're out here.

868
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.239
God knows I agree with you.

869
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.359
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies,

870
01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:58.239
foreign, sir, and domestic.

871
01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:02.759
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

872
01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.639
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

873
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.079
We're dead.

874
01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.439
Your unit is covered
from an elevated position, commander.

875
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.279
I'm not gonna ask again.
Don't do anything stupid.

876
01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:16.719
No one has to die here.

877
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:21.039
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

878
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.040
Have you forgotten that?

879
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.159
We all have shipmates we remember.

880
01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.479
Some of them were shit on and pissed on
by the Pentagon.

881
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.079
But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!

882
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.359
You call it what you want!
You're down there, we're up here!

883
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.440
- You walked into the wrong damn room!
- Stand fast!

884
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.559
One last time. Tell your men
to safety weapons, drop 'em.

885
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.079
- I cannot give that!
- I am not gonna repeat!

886
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.919
- I will not give that order!
- What is wrong with you?

887
01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.039
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

888
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.399
- Waste these fuckers.
- One last time.

889
01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.199
Order your men
to safety their weapons...

890
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.719
Cease fire!

891
01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.679
Don't go.

892
01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.559
Cease fire!

893
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.079
Cease fire!

894
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.559
Shit! Goddamn it!
Let go of me. Let go of me!

895
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.679
Don't. Don't go.

896
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.959
Fuck.

897
01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.519
It's over.

898
01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.799
Oh, God!

899
01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:03.159
Mason.

900
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.799
- We got some movement.
- Who?

901
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.319
- Two of 'em!
- Who is it?

902
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.720
- Eagles 11 and 12.
- Goodspeed and Mason.

903
01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:22.559
- I knew it.
- I've gotta get a team together right now.

904
01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.999
- Move with the second option.
- Another massacre? No way.

905
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.519
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

906
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.839
Not for Mason, it isn't.

907
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.199
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

908
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.839
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

909
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.839
What? What for?

910
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.839
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

911
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.559
It's for you.

912
01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.199
- Sir?
- What's the status?

913
01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.839
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

914
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.279
It's just me and Mason.
He says he's leaving.

915
01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.279
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

916
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:16.039
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

917
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.999
You have a fuckin' water pistol?

918
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.879
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

919
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.960
I didn't want this.

920
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.599
- Jesus, not this.
- You knew this might happen.

921
01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.679
- Maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't.

922
01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.199
Then maybe we need
to execute a few hostages.

923
01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:37.239
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

924
01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.959
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, captain.

925
01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.999
Sir?

926
01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:05.919
You made a terrible mistake.

927
01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.160
And more of our brothers
have died in vain.

928
01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.040
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

929
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.199
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

930
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.639
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

931
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.079
I'm tellin' you now,

932
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:25.639
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

933
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:27.559
All right, you wanna know?

934
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.559
1962. J. Edgar Hoover is head
of the FBI, some say the country.

935
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.559
No secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans,

936
01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:40.319
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the prime minister.

937
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.039
This guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

938
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.559
I know the cloak-and-dagger stories.
Where does Mason fit in?

939
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:49.319
Mason was the British operative
who stole files.

940
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.039
Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

941
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.159
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

942
01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.199
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm,

943
01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.599
but he never did.

944
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.319
Hoover didn't use
his daughter as leverage?

945
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.439
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

946
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.079
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

947
01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:15.279
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life. No wonder he's pissed.

948
01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:19.639
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century.

949
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.799
The alien landing at Roswell,
the truth about the JFK assassination.

950
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.719
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

951
01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.799
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

952
01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.119
Mason! Mason!

953
01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:42.079
- There are 81 hostages still up there.
- Yeah, like me.

954
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.679
You wanna play tough?
Wanna play tough with me?

955
01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.519
OK. FBI! Freeze, sucker!

956
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.759
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

957
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.079
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

958
01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.479
Let's find out.

959
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.199
I could. You, no.

960
01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.319
Besides, your safety's on.

961
01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.199
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

962
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.079
Not yet.

963
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:20.119
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

964
01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.719
Right, I don't use guns,
don't kick down doors.

965
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.239
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

966
01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.599
What it says
is chemical weapons specialist.

967
01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.319
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man,

968
01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:36.199
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

969
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:39.479
That lying Womack.

970
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.919
- You could've told my daughter.
- It was classified.

971
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.079
Look, I'm in the same situation.

972
01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.239
They've got my girlfriend
in the city, a baby on the way.

973
01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:53.119
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

974
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.519
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

975
01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.999
This man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

976
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.519
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

977
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.520
Probably a maze of tunnels.
Check every access.

978
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.639
Sir.

979
01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:24.439
Even if you escape from the island,
you can't escape the rockets.

980
01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:29.479
So where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are you gonna do?

981
01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:36.919
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

982
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.439
What about your daughter? Mason?

983
01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:45.679
Rodents located.

984
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.919
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

985
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:51.999
I don't think you do.

986
01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.479
Move!

987
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:31.959
- They're on to us.
- Burn 'em out.

988
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.399
This mother's gonna blow big.

989
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.679
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

990
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.319
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

991
01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:34.319
- So, what's it gonna be?
- What?

992
01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.639
How do you like your choices?

993
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.599
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

994
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.839
All right, come on.

995
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.999
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

996
01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.079
Did you know it was
originally a Civil War fort?

997
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.959
Really? Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history too,

998
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.119
and maybe when this is over,
we can stop by the souvenir shop.

999
01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:00.479
But right now I just...
I wanna find some rockets.

1000
01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.479
Don't tempt me.

1001
01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.199
We are going to the morgue.

1002
01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:31.319
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1003
01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:37.799
Your best?
Losers always whine about their best.

1004
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:41.119
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1005
01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.319
Carla was the prom queen.

1006
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.560
- Really?
- Yeah.

1007
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.239
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1008
01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.839
Come on, come on.
You can do it, doc.

1009
01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.839
Shit!

1010
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.399
You must never hesitate.

1011
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.719
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1012
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.039
- Him, but not the rocket.
- Any other news, professor?

1013
01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.999
Not the rocket! Not the rocket.

1014
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.519
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1015
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.839
Oh, yeah, OK. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1016
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.599
Mason...

1017
01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.479
The second you don't respect this,
it kills you. Put it there.

1018
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.839
You've been around a lot of corpses.
Is that normal?

1019
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.959
- The feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1020
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.319
- Yeah, that happens.
- I'm having a hard time concentrating.

1021
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.039
- Can you do something about it?
- Like what? Kill him again?

1022
01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.479
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1023
01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.719
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1024
01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.199
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.

1025
01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:07.559
What I'm dealing with
is one of the most deadly substances

1026
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:12.319
the Earth has ever known. What do you
say you cut me some friggin' slack?

1027
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:31.479
Elegant string-of-pearls configuration.
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1028
01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.239
- What exactly does this stuff do?
- If the rocket renders it aerosol,

1029
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.919
it can take out
the entire city of people.

1030
01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:41.999
Really? And what
happens if you drop one?

1031
01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.919
Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.

1032
01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:48.319
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1033
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:51.479
Stops the brain sending
messages down the spinal cord.

1034
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:54.519
Epidermal exposure or inhalation,
and you'll know.

1035
01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:59.159
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1036
01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:00.839
Do not move that!

1037
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.159
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

1038
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.160
Spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit guts out.

1039
01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.359
- But that's after your skin melts off.
- My God.

1040
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.919
I think we'd like God on our side
at the moment, don't you?

1041
01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.759
So, what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips

1042
01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.119
so the rocket will splash down after
500 feet. All right, let me have that.

1043
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.079
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1044
01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.319
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1045
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.839
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

1046
01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.519
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1047
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.999
Somebody's still there. Let's move!

1048
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.319
Rats alive! Close on the morgue!

1049
01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.439
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1050
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.719
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1051
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.759
Hold it.

1052
01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:04.199
Converge on the morgue. Move out.

1053
01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.199
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1054
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.399
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1055
01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.959
Come on. Time's up.

1056
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.319
Three rockets somewhere else.
Find them!

1057
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.119
Come on!

1058
01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.959
Clear!

1059
01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.439
I'm too old for this.

1060
01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.519
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1061
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.079
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1062
01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:52.959
I guess you didn't
take care of the rat problem.

1063
01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.039
- No, sir.
- There are two dead men here

1064
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.159
- who suggest you finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

1065
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.480
Yes, sir! Rio, Royce, let's go!

1066
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.359
- You don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1067
01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.759
It's picking up speed.
Know how to slow it?

1068
01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.559
No, I don't.

1069
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.159
God!

1070
01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.959
Mason, you all right?

1071
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:57.879
Yes, perfectly OK, you fucking idiot!

1072
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:02.559
- They're coming.
- Who?

1073
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.479
- The Marines!
- Where?

1074
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.639
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1075
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.199
No! No!

1076
01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:31.759
Mason!

1077
01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:37.039
Mason!

1078
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.439
You motherfucker!

1079
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.839
Die! Die! Die!

1080
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.119
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1081
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.359
How do you... do it?

1082
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.759
I was trained by the best.
British intelligence.

1083
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.799
Come on.

1084
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.919
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1085
01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:39.559
OK.

1086
01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.839
OK, the president arrives
in three hours.

1087
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.439
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1088
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.919
- What's the word from Mojave?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1089
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:57.559
They're going as fast as they can.

1090
01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:05.839
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1091
01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.799
Navy SEALs, listen. You've got
something that belongs to me.

1092
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.239
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1093
01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:25.639
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1094
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.519
Speak up.

1095
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.439
- Speak up!
- I...

1096
01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.519
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1097
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.359
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

1098
01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:41.839
And they've got a gun to my head.

1099
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.559
You've got three minutes to return
the chips to the exercise yard

1100
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.279
- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

1101
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.799
Hey.

1102
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:57.279
Now, three to go.
You find them and defuse them, OK?

1103
01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.919
- All right.
- All right.

1104
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.359
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1105
01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.639
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1106
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.999
OK? What do you mean?

1107
01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:18.159
OK.

1108
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.239
- Will you help us?
- Come on, come on.

1109
01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.199
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1110
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.199
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1111
01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.320
Bingo.

1112
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.999
Stand easy.

1113
01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.359
Thought I'd been
in the service a long time.

1114
01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.559
- Name and rank, sailor.
- It's Army, actually.

1115
01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:19.119
Answer the question.
And address him as general, sir.

1116
01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.879
Captain John Patrick Mason,
general, sir,

1117
01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.799
of Her Majesty's SAS.
Retired, of course.

1118
01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:34.799
You're a long way from home, captain.
How the hell are you involved in this?

1119
01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.799
I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1120
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.239
I was formerly a guest here.

1121
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.319
Hi, sweetie.

1122
01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.839
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1123
01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.359
Did they tell you who I am,
why I'm doing this?

1124
01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:12.479
Or are they just using you?

1125
01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:16.359
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1126
01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.639
You wouldn't have any
idea what it means

1127
01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.879
to lead the finest men into battle,
and then see their memory betrayed.

1128
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.039
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead

1129
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.799
by killing another million.
And this is not combat.

1130
01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.999
It's an act of lunacy, general, sir.

1131
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.759
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1132
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.919
The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time

1133
01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:50.359
with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
Thomas Jefferson.

1134
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:55.199
Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious,
according to Oscar Wilde.

1135
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.439
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1136
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.159
Where are the guidance chips?

1137
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.239
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1138
01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.239
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1139
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.439
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

1140
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.639
I'd take pleasure in guttin' you.

1141
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.879
I'd take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1142
01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:01.879
I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1143
01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:04.159
What is wrong
with these people, Mason?

1144
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:07.199
Don't you think there's
a lot of... a lot of anger

1145
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:11.399
floatin' around this island?
Pubescent volatility? Don't you think?

1146
01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.519
A lot of angst, a lot of, I'm 16,
I'm angry at my father syndrome?

1147
01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.719
I mean, grow up!

1148
01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.839
We're on an island with
violence-for-pleasure-seeking

1149
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.479
psychopathic Marines.
Shame on them!

1150
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.959
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

1151
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.119
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1152
01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.199
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was

1153
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.919
when the inmates
weren't allowed to talk in here.

1154
01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.599
Not allowed to talk.

1155
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:43.479
How'd you do it?

1156
01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:47.359
Nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

1157
01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.839
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1158
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.119
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1159
01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:58.719
Modest hopes,
but they kept a man alive.

1160
01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.799
What'd they put you away for, John?

1161
01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.959
That's a long story.

1162
01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.799
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1163
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.879
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1164
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.599
Seven hours.

1165
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.239
- Thermite plasma is operational.
- Get me the president.

1166
01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.759
- Be seated.
- Consider yourselves on ground alert.

1167
01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.519
If we receive launch authority,
your mission is thermal destruction

1168
01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:30.079
of Alcatraz Island.
The entire island is to be blanketed,

1169
01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.079
not one square inch missed.
Eighty-one civilians

1170
01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:36.679
and a number of US Marines will lose
their lives in this air strike.

1171
01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.639
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was

1172
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.679
and create a solution?

1173
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.279
The moment they had the microfilm,
they'd suicide me.

1174
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.439
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1175
01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:56.159
Which brings me to another question.
When you broke out...

1176
01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.519
Let me see if I can get this straight.

1177
01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.319
You went down the incinerator chute,
on the mine car,

1178
01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:06.359
through the tunnels to the power plant,
under the steam engine...

1179
01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.799
That was really cool, by the way.

1180
01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.519
And into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

1181
01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:16.559
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole,

1182
01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.439
did you get out of your cell?

1183
01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.399
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1184
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.079
well, it could prove
to be useful information maybe!

1185
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.919
Trade secrets, my son.

1186
01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.759
General, two operational rockets left.

1187
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:57.439
One's at the lower lighthouse, one on
the roof. Both birds are ready to fly.

1188
01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.719
- General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, captain.

1189
01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.239
Just makin' sure.

1190
01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.599
Should we prepare for launch, general?

1191
01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:10.679
- I'll handle the strategy, captain.
- Yes, sir.

1192
01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:17.119
The hour is approaching, sir. Just
letting the general know of the time.

1193
01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.999
- I'm very aware of the time, captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1194
01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.719
My boys are ready
to cock, lock, ready to rock.

1195
01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:29.839
- Mason, where're you going?
- I vowed I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1196
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.079
You're not leaving! There's a madman
in there with his hand on a button!

1197
01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.679
Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1198
01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:42.439
Stop moving, Mason.

1199
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.119
Mason, stop moving.

1200
01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:48.959
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1201
01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:52.399
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1202
01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.439
Well, then, everything's just fine!

1203
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.519
- I can't afford that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1204
01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.079
Three minutes to go, sir.

1205
01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:04.599
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- They'll call.

1206
01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:07.839
They'll call if we fire one
of our rockets up their ass.

1207
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.119
Sir.

1208
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.879
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1209
01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.759
- How's it going?
- How do you think it's goin'?

1210
01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:24.359
- We're gonna need another hour.
- You've got three minutes.

1211
01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.159
We have to get authorisation
from the president.

1212
01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.479
- You've got three minutes.
- Please don't do anything stupid.

1213
01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:35.599
They want another hour.

1214
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:38.879
That's bullshit.
Bullshit, general. They're lyin'!

1215
01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:44.319
They're calling our bluff, sir.
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1216
01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.919
Order the launch, general.

1217
01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:51.479
Come on, general.
Let's be all we can be.

1218
01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:08.839
- The mission's not complete!
- Well, mine is.

1219
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.719
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1220
01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.759
driving Carla and your baby insane
in your beige Volvo.

1221
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:20.359
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

1222
01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.199
You're not leaving.

1223
01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.479
All right, I'll do it myself.

1224
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.759
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1225
01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.919
I'll kick the... out of
a platoon full of Marines.

1226
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.639
No problem.

1227
01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:54.479
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1228
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:58.319
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1229
01:41:58.480 --> 01:42:00.079
Let's go!

1230
01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.639
Laser powered up!

1231
01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:12.279
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1232
01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:17.679
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1233
01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.639
- Glass or plastic?
- What?

1234
01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.279
- Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1235
01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.919
If the winds change
after you launch rockets,

1236
01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.919
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1237
01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.639
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1238
01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.199
So, what do you say you do the math,
hand over the gun,

1239
01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:37.519
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck...

1240
01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:47.039
You made the right choice.

1241
01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.999
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father.

1242
01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.239
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1243
01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.239
So I'm fucked either way.
So come on.

1244
01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.079
Weapon is hot. Standing by
for the launch command.

1245
01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.159
Killing Navy SEALs is one thing...

1246
01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.239
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1247
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.199
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1248
01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.119
Launch coordinates, six, seven,

1249
01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:17.279
five, four, five, niner.

1250
01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.479
The weapon is hot.
I'm standing by for launch command.

1251
01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:25.239
That's affirmative.

1252
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.119
Standing by for command.

1253
01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:44.439
I'm waiting for launch command, general.

1254
01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:54.199
- Fire.
- Fire!

1255
01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:02.039
Missile loose! Missile loose!

1256
01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.719
Origin, Alcatraz, 67253725.

1257
01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.679
- What's the goddamn heading?
- 185 degrees south southeast.

1258
01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:19.599
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots. Right at Oakland.

1259
01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:20.879
Football game.

1260
01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.319
Oh, my God.

1261
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.159
Missile changing direction.

1262
01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.399
New direction, 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1263
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.639
Oh, Christ!

1264
01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:06.359
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1265
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.239
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1266
01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.599
Bogey detonated under water.

1267
01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:23.359
- What the fuck?
- It missed.

1268
01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.839
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1269
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.079
But there's still one left.

1270
01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.720
What happened to the rocket?
What happened to the coordinates?

1271
01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:34.879
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

1272
01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:37.919
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1273
01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:40.159
Captain, step outside!

1274
01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.479
Get me the Pentagon.

1275
01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:09.839
What the hell was that, Frank?

1276
01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.639
- What the hell...?
- I heard!

1277
01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:16.519
You're gonna be insubordinate,
do it with respect.

1278
01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:18.879
Cut the crap.
What the hell are you doing?

1279
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.079
- I'm not ready to kill.
- Ask for time.

1280
01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.839
- No!
- Do it, Frank!

1281
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.319
- We're coming loose.
- You're coming loose.

1282
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.079
- The rest of us are in control.
- We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.

1283
01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:32.039
- Put the phone down.
- The men are falling apart!

1284
01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.519
- The men are Marines!
- Are they?

1285
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.119
- I wanna talk to Kramer.
- You're asked by a friend.

1286
01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.679
- Put him on the phone.
- Ordered by a superior.

1287
01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:44.639
- This is Major Baxter!
- Last chance by a man with a gun.

1288
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.319
Put the phone down.

1289
01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:54.439
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1290
01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.319
At ease.

1291
01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.239
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1292
01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.879
These past few hours

1293
01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.519
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1294
01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.000
How does one weigh human life?

1295
01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:29.679
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1296
01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:33.759
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1297
01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.839
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalised

1298
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.399
a great soldier like Frank Hummel,

1299
01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:46.199
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood

1300
01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.119
is equally real and equally tragic.

1301
01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.799
We are at war with terror.

1302
01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:58.319
Fighting a war means casualties.

1303
01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:01.759
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1304
01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.279
Air strike approved.

1305
01:48:11.240 --> 01:48:13.919
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

1306
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.799
With the firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1307
01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:19.519
- Prepared to go.
- It'll be over in seconds.

1308
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.399
Flight time to drop point, 17 minutes.

1309
01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.839
Excuse me, general, sir,
with all due respect to you,

1310
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:35.159
- but what the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates?

1311
01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:38.719
- That's affirmative, captain.
- The Feds think we're gutless?

1312
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.639
- They think we won't do it.
- They're gonna come at us

1313
01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.639
with everything, air and sea.
Bomb us to the Stone Age.

1314
01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:48.279
- They don't know we missed on purpose.
- Great.

1315
01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.799
We're not gutless, we're incompetent.
That right?

1316
01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.399
I don't like your tone, captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1317
01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:59.119
Load VX into choppers,
take hostages, evacuate.

1318
01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.639
- The consequences I'll face alone.
- Excuse me, general,

1319
01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.519
but what about the fucking money?

1320
01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.999
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1321
01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.879
- Bullshit it's over.
- You're talking to a general, soldier!

1322
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:14.199
- Maintain discipline.
- I'm not a soldier, Major.

1323
01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.959
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

1324
01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.559
I want my fucking money!

1325
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:24.119
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1326
01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:27.319
I'm not about
to kill 80,000 innocent people.

1327
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.239
Think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1328
01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:34.079
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1329
01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.919
Whoever said anything about bluffing?

1330
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.359
Stand down, captain.

1331
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:48.879
Stand down, captain!

1332
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:57.919
Major, take these men
to the choppers and evacuate.

1333
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.679
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1334
01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.519
Sergeant Crisp, secure the general.

1335
01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.319
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1336
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.919
Sergeant!

1337
01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:27.839
- I'll have that sidearm.
- You mean this sidearm?

1338
01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:39.719
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1339
01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:48.399
It has been the greatest honour
of my life to serve with you, general.

1340
01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:54.999
But like he said...

1341
01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:57.919
it's over.

1342
01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.839
Let's get him.

1343
01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.839
Mason!

1344
01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.639
My God, what have I done?

1345
01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:30.479
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1346
01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:36.199
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1347
01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.039
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1348
01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:54.439
Darrow, go to the lighthouse!
I'll take care of this fucker!

1349
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:04.519
One, two, three! Eat that!

1350
01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:19.479
Did it.

1351
01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:53.039
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

1352
01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:56.759
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1353
01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:59.199
Come on. Don't be scared.
I won't hurt ya.

1354
01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.399
- Come on.
- Know how this shit works?

1355
01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:03.639
You know how this shit works?

1356
01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.519
Come on. Come on.
I don't need the gun. I'll put it down.

1357
01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.759
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1358
01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:20.319
Listen, I think we got started off on
the wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI.

1359
01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:23.479
Let's talk music.
Like the Elton John song Rocket Man?

1360
01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:26.879
- I don't like soft-ass shit.
- You...

1361
01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:31.359
Well, I only bring it up
because... it's you.

1362
01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:32.839
You're the Rocket Man.

1363
01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.519
No!

1364
01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.559
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1365
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.839
- Splashed into the bay. No detonation.
- Shit!

1366
01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:16.599
Darrow!

1367
01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:19.479
Open up!

1368
01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.439
- Come on.
- Open up!

1369
01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:55.439
Hey, you mother!

1370
01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:29.879
I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1371
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.399
OK.

1372
01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:40.319
I got ya. I got you, baby.

1373
01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.639
Come on.

1374
01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.439
Red Thunder Strike Leader.
Time on target, seven minutes.

1375
01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:49.879
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1376
01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:55.240
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1377
01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.799
Fuck!

1378
01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.399
It's me and you, pal.
I want that fucking chip!

1379
01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.159
I love pressure.

1380
01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.080
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1381
01:57:47.240 --> 01:57:49.319
Pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1382
01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.879
Increase speed to 500 knots.

1383
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.839
You motherfucker! Die!

1384
01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:30.959
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1385
01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.799
Eat that, you fuck!

1386
01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:03.479
Team, inbound.
Time on target, 60 seconds.

1387
01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:12.119
Come to course heading 142 degrees.

1388
01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:21.519
When he neutralises the threat,

1389
01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:24.679
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1390
01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.680
- Tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1391
01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.919
Don't let this happen.
There has to be something you can do.

1392
01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.719
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1393
01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:00.999
Target acquired. Rolling in.

1394
02:00:04.240 --> 02:00:06.879
This is Red Thunder. Master armed.

1395
02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.079
Master armed.

1396
02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.759
Time on target, 12 seconds.

1397
02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.679
TOT, ten seconds.

1398
02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:22.919
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1399
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.599
- Green smoke. I got green smoke!
- This is CQ One!

1400
02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.719
Green smoke! Green smoke! Over.

1401
02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:32.879
- Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1402
02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.639
- Flight leader, abort, abort!
- Jesus...

1403
02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:39.319
I already dropped them!

1404
02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:52.799
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, my God!

1405
02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:58.319
Get out of my way. Let me through, please.
Let me through!

1406
02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:06.079
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

1407
02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:32.039
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1408
02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:36.799
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1409
02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.239
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.

1410
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.319
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1411
02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:44.399
Goodspeed, come in.

1412
02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.679
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

1413
02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:51.959
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1414
02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:56.239
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1415
02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.839
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1416
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:06.359
This is Goodspeed.

1417
02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.639
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

1418
02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.039
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1419
02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:21.199
What about Mason?

1420
02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.679
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

1421
02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:32.439
Just come and get me.

1422
02:02:35.920 --> 02:02:37.839
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1423
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.439
But, of course. I knew he would.

1424
02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.759
The SDU's and the scuba gear
should be where we came ashore.

1425
02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.279
If you get to the Pan Pacific Hotel,
there's clothes in my closet,

1426
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.639
$200 in the Bible. Room 26.

1427
02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:56.399
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1428
02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.919
But thank you.

1429
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:05.599
Well, Stanley, this is when
we go our separate ways.

1430
02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:11.279
I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name Goodspeed.

1431
02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:15.479
Yeah, Godspeed, to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1432
02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:18.879
Well, if you fancy a journey,

1433
02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:22.239
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1434
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:24.399
I was thinking of Maui.

1435
02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:26.639
No.

1436
02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:32.680
Forget Maui.

1437
02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:43.079
St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1438
02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:47.359
Front pew, right leg. Hollow.

1439
02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:49.479
Is this what I think it is?

1440
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.079
Mason?

1441
02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:09.999
Congratulations, Goodspeed.
You did it.

1442
02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:11.959
- Thank you.
- For a while there,

1443
02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:16.119
I didn't think you were gonna make it.
Well done, son.

1444
02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:17.800
So where's Mason?

1445
02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:21.839
Vaporised. Blown out to sea.

1446
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.159
Blown out to sea?

1447
02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:25.719
Yeah.

1448
02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.479
Poor bastard.

1449
02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.399
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his body?
I wanna see that son of a bitch.

1450
02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:39.319
Vaporised, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1451
02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:41.679
What?

1452
02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:44.479
Vaporised? A body can vaporise?

1453
02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.439
Oh, yeah! Absolutely, sir.

1454
02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:54.119
St. Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

1455
02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:55.719
Front pew, right leg.

1456
02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:58.199
Vandals! Vandals!

1457
02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:00.439
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1458
02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:04.199
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1459
02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:07.039
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! OK, let's go!

1460
02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:10.319
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1461
02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:13.519
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1462
02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:17.359
Vandals! Vandals!

1463
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.919
Honey...

1464
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.199
you wanna know
who really killed JFK?
