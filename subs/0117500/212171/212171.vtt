{2270}{2405}Three billion human lives ended|on August 29, 1997.
{2443}{2513}The survivors of the nuclear fire...
{2515}{2597}called the war "Judgment Day."
{2599}{2692}They lived only to face|a new nightmare...
{2694}{2755}the war against the machines.
{5098}{5211}The computer which controlled|the machines, Skynet...
{5213}{5303}sent two Terminators|back through time.
{5305}{5427}Their mission: to destroy the leader|of the human resistance.
{5429}{5507}John Connor, my son.
{5629}{5703}The first Terminator was programmed|to strike at me...
{5705}{5764}in the year 1984...
{5766}{5836}before John was born.
{5838}{5893}It failed.
{5895}{5981}The second was set to strike|at John himself...
{5983}{6057}when he was still a child.
{6154}{6280}As before, the resistance was able|to send a lone warrior...
{6282}{6351}a protector for John.
{6353}{6455}It was just a question of which one|of them would reach him first.
{14090}{14186}I need your clothes, your boots|and your motorcycle.
{14447}{14520}You forgot to say please.
{14991}{15041}Get him off me!
{15681}{15717}Pull it out!
{16339}{16399}Take it.
{17179}{17272}Can't let you take|the man's wheels, son.
{17274}{17359}Now, get off|before I put you down.
{17626}{17697}That's it, goddamn it.
{19512}{19581}R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...
{19583}{19701}at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe|on electrical disturbance.
{19733}{19800}Ten-four, R-31 David.
{21853}{21957}"JMA Query: Connor, John"
{22702}{22793}John, get in there and clean up|that pigsty of yours.
{23139}{23205}Your foster parents|are kind of dicks, huh?
{23207}{23307}I swear, I have had it|with that goddamn kid.
{23309}{23389}- He won't even answer me anymore.|- Honey, move.
{23391}{23479}Would you get off your butt|and help me?
{23481}{23566}- Todd!|- What?
{23568}{23669}He hasn't cleaned that room of his|in a month.
{23671}{23765}Oh, it's an emergency.|Hang on. I'll get right on it.
{23996}{24049}Come on.
{24051}{24148}Get your ass inside.|Do what your mother tells you.
{24182}{24266}She's not my mother, Todd.
{25061}{25111}This next patient is interesting.
{25113}{25187}I've been following the case|for years.
{25189}{25252}A 29-year-old female...
{25322}{25402}diagnosed as acute|schizo-affective disorder.
{25404}{25502}The usual indicators: depression,|anxiety, violent acting out...
{25504}{25556}delusions of persecution.
{25748}{25850}The delusional architecture|is fairly unique.
{25852}{25937}She believes that a machine|called the Terminator...
{25939}{26040}which looks human,|was sent back through time...
{26042}{26104}to kill her.|- That's original.
{26106}{26203}And also that the father|of her child...
{26205}{26304}was a soldier sent back|to protect her.
{26306}{26364}He was from the future too.
{26366}{26505}The year 2029,|if I remember correctly.
{26507}{26573}And here we are.
{26597}{26630}Morning, Sarah.
{26761}{26878}Good morning, Dr. Silberman.|How's the knee?
{26934}{26992}Fine, Sarah.
{27026}{27094}She stabbed me in the kneecap...
{27096}{27202}with my pen a few weeks ago.
{27204}{27248}Repeated escape attempts.
{27554}{27625}Let's move on, shall we?
{27627}{27727}I don't like to see the patients|disrupting their rooms like this.
{27729}{27835}- See she takes her Thorazine.|- Sure. I'll take care of it.
{28537}{28601}Are you the legal guardian|of John Connor?
{28603}{28710}That's right, Officer.|What's he done now?
{28712}{28801}- Could I speak with him, please?|- You could if he were here.
{28803}{28889}He took off on his bike this morning.|He could be anywhere.
{28891}{28961}Do you have a photograph of John?
{28963}{29000}Yeah. Hold on.
{29076}{29156}Gonna tell me what this is about?
{29158}{29235}I just need to ask him|a few questions.
{29270}{29385}He's a good-looking boy.|Do you mind if I keep this picture?
{29387}{29492}No, go on. There was a guy here|this morning looking for him too.
{29494}{29560}Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
{29562}{29635}Has that got something|to do with this?
{29735}{29828}I wouldn't worry about him.
{29830}{29915}Thanks for your cooperation.
{29951}{30035}Please insert your stolen card now.
{30253}{30305}PIN number.
{30342}{30390}Hurry up. This is taking too long.
{30392}{30437}Go, baby.
{30484}{30528}All right.
{30530}{30642}- PIN number 9003.|- Where'd you learn this stuff from?
{30644}{30719}From my mom.|My real mom, I mean.
{30721}{30849}Withdraw 300 bucks.
{30851}{30935}Come on, baby. Come on!
{30937}{31005}- Yes!|- Hey, it worked.
{31007}{31116}All right. Easy money.|Come on!
{31192}{31255}Yes! Piece of cake.
{31413}{31507}- ls that her?|- Yes.
{31509}{31565}She's pretty cool, huh?
{31567}{31635}No, she's a complete psycho.
{31637}{31718}That's why she's at Pescadero.|It's a mental institute.
{31770}{31862}She tried to blow up a computer factory|but got shot and arrested.
{31864}{31926}No shit.
{31948}{32020}She's a total loser.
{32022}{32103}Come on.|Let's go spend some money.
{32554}{32673}It's like a giant strobe light...
{32675}{32745}burning right through my eyes.
{32865}{32940}Somehow I can still see.
{33116}{33174}Oh, God.
{33274}{33378}We know the dream's the same|every night.
{33380}{33481}- Why do I have to...|- Please continue.
{33593}{33675}Children look like burnt paper.
{33724}{33788}Black.
{33790}{33848}Not moving.
{33903}{33975}And then the blast wave hits them.
{34254}{34335}And they fly apart like leaves.
{34387}{34421}Dreams...
{34423}{34489}of cataclysm,|the end of the world...
{34491}{34549}are very common.
{34600}{34727}It's not a dream, you moron.|It's real.
{34729}{34848}- I know the date it happens.|- I'm sure it feels real to you.
{34850}{34925}On August 29, 1997...
{34927}{35033}it's gonna feel|pretty fuckin' real to you too!
{35035}{35206}Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock|is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?
{35208}{35294}God, you think|you're safe and alive.
{35296}{35365}You're already dead. Everybody!
{35367}{35443}Him. You. You're dead already.
{35445}{35532}This whole place,|everything you see is gone!
{35534}{35656}You're the one living in the dream,|'cause I know it happened!
{35658}{35716}It happened!
{36046}{36137}I feel much better now.
{36139}{36196}Clearer.
{36198}{36282}Yes, your attitude has been...
{36284}{36353}much improved lately.
{36632}{36707}It's helped me to have a goal...
{36709}{36806}something to look forward to.
{36808}{36842}What is that?
{36844}{36915}Well, you said...
{36917}{37033}that if I showed improvement|after six months...
{37035}{37115}you would transfer me|to the minimum security wing...
{37117}{37200}and I could have visitors.
{37249}{37325}Well, it's been six months...
{37327}{37370}and...
{37404}{37472}I was looking forward|to seeing my son.
{37504}{37562}I see.
{37644}{37770}Let's go back to what you were saying|about those Terminator machines.
{37805}{37907}Now you think they don't exist?
{37909}{37980}They don't exist.
{37982}{38033}I know that now.
{38035}{38130}But you've told me on many occasions|about how you crushed one...
{38132}{38195}in a hydraulic press.
{38236}{38330}If I had, there would have|been some evidence.
{38332}{38405}They would have found something|at the factory.
{38407}{38471}I see.
{38473}{38575}So you don't believe anymore|that the company covered it up?
{38644}{38730}No. Why would they?
{38732}{38830}Let's try a new position|right there.
{39127}{39227}Mr. Dyson?
{39229}{39308}The materials team|is running another...
{39310}{39360}- Mr. Dyson.|- Yes?
{39362}{39452}The materials team is running|another series this afternoon.
{39454}{39543}You have to sign for the... it.
{39545}{39630}- You have to sign it out.|- Okay. I'll get it.
{39686}{39811}I know I haven't been here long,|but I was wondering if you know...
{39813}{39854}Know what?
{39856}{39936}If you know where 'it' came from.
{39938}{40041}I asked them the same question once.|You know what they told me?
{40043}{40101}Don't ask.
{40279}{40370}- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.|- How's it going?
{40372}{40461}Insert key.|Left on three.
{40463}{40533}Two, one, turn.
{40625}{40721}- How are the wife and kids?|- Great. Thanks.
{41534}{41628}So what do you think, Doctor?
{41655}{41713}Haven't I shown improvement?
{41751}{41835}Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
{41868}{41941}I know how smart you are.
{41943}{42003}You're just telling me|what I want to hear.
{42035}{42127}I don't think you really believe|what you're telling me today.
{42129}{42245}If I put you in minimum security,|you'll just try to escape again.
{42391}{42460}You have to let me see my son.
{42497}{42545}Please.
{42664}{42760}He's in great danger.|He's naked without me.
{42802}{42846}If I could make a phone call...
{42848}{42922}I'm afraid not.|Not for a while.
{42989}{43063}I don't see any choice but to|recommend to the review board...
{43065}{43141}that you stay here|for another six months.
{43237}{43335}I'll kill you,|you son of a bitch!
{43367}{43425}You son of a bitch!
{43470}{43586}Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!
{43588}{43633}You don't know what you're doing!
{43635}{43699}Get some restraints in here now!
{43734}{43842}You don't know what you're doing!
{43956}{44026}Model citizen.
{45195}{45277}You just missed him.|He was here 15 minutes ago.
{45279}{45375}- He was going to the galleria.|- Yeah.
{45377}{45430}The galleria?
{46785}{46881}I'm gonna get some quarters.|I'll be back, all right?
{47328}{47413}- Oh, no!|- Girls, do you know John Connor?
{47525}{47608}Hey, do you know this guy?
{47610}{47675}Nah, I don't know him.
{47835}{47907}- John.|- Not now.
{47909}{48007}There's this cop scoping for you.|Check it out.
{48083}{48141}- He's right over there.|- Split, man.
{48143}{48217}- Just go.|- Yeah.
{48358}{48395}I saw that kid...
{48855}{48913}You're not supposed to|be in here!
{49684}{49720}Get down.
{51842}{51906}Mister, are you all right?
{51942}{51977}You all right?
{52435}{52472}Come on!
{53667}{53710}Goddamn!
{62075}{62157}Okay, time-out.|Stop the bike.
{62159}{62237}Time out.|Come on, stop the bike.
{62629}{62711}Holy shit.|Now, don't take this the wrong way.
{62713}{62785}- You are a Terminator, right?|- Yes.
{62787}{62871}Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
{63219}{63277}Holy shit.
{63322}{63400}You're really real.
{63402}{63460}I mean...
{63535}{63625}You're like a machine underneath,|right?
{63627}{63672}But alive outside?
{63674}{63732}I'm a cybernetic organism.
{63734}{63815}Living tissue|over metal endoskeleton.
{64259}{64325}This is intense.
{64327}{64410}Get a grip, John. Okay.
{64488}{64552}You're not here to kill me.
{64554}{64673}I figured that part out for myself.|So what's the deal?
{64675}{64757}My mission is to protect you.
{64759}{64838}Yeah? Who sent you?
{64874}{64909}You did.
{64911}{64977}Thirty-five years from now,|you reprogrammed me...
{64979}{65061}to be your protector here,|in this time.
{65063}{65150}Oh, this is deep.
{65209}{65289}So this other guy, he's|a Terminator like you, right?
{65291}{65413}Not like me.|A T-1000, advanced prototype.
{65461}{65515}More advanced than you are?
{65517}{65597}Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
{65599}{65653}What the hell does that mean?
{65655}{65713}Liquid metal.
{65745}{65783}Where are we going?
{65785}{65886}We have to get out of the city|immediately and avoid the authorities.
{65888}{65970}I gotta stop by my house.|I wanna pick up some stuff.
{65972}{66115}Negative. The T-1000 would definitely|try to reacquire you there.
{66117}{66201}- You sure?|- I would.
{66519}{66599}Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
{66667}{66711}but I gotta warn'em.
{66713}{66785}Shit. You got a quarter?
{67047}{67138}- Hello.|- Janelle, it's me.
{67140}{67211}- John?|- ls everything all right?
{67213}{67286}- Are you guys okay?|- Sure, honey, everything's okay.
{67288}{67381}- Are you all right?|- Yeah, I'm fine.
{67383}{67491}John, it's late.|I was beginning to worry about you.
{67493}{67574}If you hurry home, we can sit down|and have dinner together.
{67576}{67622}I'm making beef stew.
{67624}{67713}Something's wrong.|She's never this nice.
{67715}{67768}Where are you?
{67770}{67857}What the hell is|the goddamn dog barking at?
{67859}{67957}Hey, shut up,|you worthless piece of shit!
{67959}{68005}The dog's really barking.
{68007}{68073}You were gonna tell the kid|to get rid of that mutt.
{68189}{68272}John, it's late.|Please don't make me worry.
{68274}{68325}Could he already be there?
{68360}{68400}Are you okay?
{68402}{68522}- I'm right here. I'm fine.|- Are you sure you're all right?
{68524}{68623}- What's the dog's name?|- Max.
{68625}{68697}Hey, Janelle.|What's wrong with Wolfie?
{68699}{68777}I can hear him barking.|ls he okay?
{68779}{68895}Wolfie's fine, honey.|Wolfie's just fine.
{68897}{68948}Where are you?
{68995}{69028}Your foster parents are dead.
{70163}{70223}I need a minute here.
{70225}{70355}You're telling me that this thing|can imitate anything it touches?
{70357}{70445}Anything it samples|by physical contact.
{70447}{70491}Get real.
{70493}{70606}It could disguise itself|as a pack of cigarettes?
{70608}{70666}No, only an object|of equal size.
{70668}{70745}Why not just become a bomb|or something to get me?
{70747}{70808}It can't form complex machines.
{70810}{70888}Guns and explosives|have chemicals, moving parts.
{70890}{70931}It doesn't work that way.
{70933}{71012}- But it can form solid metal shapes.|- Like what?
{71014}{71077}Knives and stabbing weapons.
{71100}{71173}These were taken by|a video surveillance camera...
{71175}{71282}at the West Highland Police Station|in 1984.
{71321}{71410}He killed 17 police officers|that night.
{71457}{71515}Men with families...
{71562}{71605}children.
{71654}{71724}These were taken at a mall|in Reseda...
{71726}{71791}today.
{71828}{71925}Miss Connor, we know you know|who this guy is.
{72007}{72140}I just sat here and told you|that your son is missing...
{72142}{72228}that the foster parents|have been murdered.
{72230}{72280}We know this guy's involved.
{72314}{72414}Doesn't that mean anything to you?|Don't you care?
{72560}{72604}We're wasting our time.
{72606}{72670}Let's go.
{72672}{72749}Sorry, guys.
{72751}{72879}She's grown more disconnected|from reality as time goes on.
{72881}{72949}I'm afraid she can't help us now.
{72951}{73048}If she clears at all and can|give us anything, I'll call you.
{73050}{73097}Sure.
{73099}{73190}Douglas, take her back to her room.
{73192}{73225}Yes, sir.
{73274}{73336}Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
{73338}{73402}You see...
{73404}{73500}we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua|and places like that.
{73536}{73668}For a while there, she was with|this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...
{73670}{73711}running guns.
{73713}{73802}Then there were some other guys.
{73804}{73864}She'd shack up with anybody|she could learn from...
{73866}{73962}so she could teach me how to be|this great military leader.
{74016}{74077}Then she gets busted.
{74079}{74187}It's like, 'Sorry, kid, your mom's|a psycho. Didn't you know?'
{74254}{74370}Like everything I've been brought up|to believe is all made-up bullshit.
{74372}{74452}I hated her for that.
{74549}{74630}But everything she said was true.
{74669}{74727}She knew...
{74792}{74855}and nobody believed her...
{74907}{74965}not even me.
{75023}{75080}Listen. We gotta get her|out of there.
{75082}{75182}Negative. The T-1000's highest|probability for success now...
{75184}{75276}will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait|for you to make contact with her.
{75278}{75341}Great. What happens to her?
{75343}{75430}Typically, the subject being copied|is terminated.
{75432}{75529}Shit! Why didn't you tell me?|We gotta go right now!
{75531}{75594}Negative.|It's not a mission priority.
{75596}{75661}Fuck you!|She's a priority to me!
{75717}{75837}Goddamn it!|What's your problem? Help!
{75839}{75894}This does not help our mission.
{75896}{75970}Get this psycho off of me!|Help!
{75972}{76064}I'm being kidnapped!|Get this psycho off of me!
{76066}{76097}Let me go!
{76233}{76287}Why did you do that?
{76289}{76346}Because you told me to.
{76431}{76474}What?
{76625}{76685}You have to do what I say?
{76687}{76754}That's one of my mission parameters.
{76791}{76897}Prove it.|Stand on one foot.
{76959}{77004}Yes!
{77069}{77177}Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
{77221}{77260}You okay, kid?

{77306}{77384}Let's get outta here, man.
{77386}{77442}Fuck you, you little dipshit!
{77465}{77508}Dipshit?
{77573}{77637}Put your leg down.
{77639}{77784}- Did you call moi a dipshit?|- Just trying to help this punk.
{77786}{77856}Grab this guy.
{77892}{77941}Get him off of me!
{77943}{78006}Now who's the dipshit...
{78008}{78061}you jock douche bag?
{78334}{78408}Put the gun down now!
{78410}{78507}- Get outta here!|- Come on. Let's split!
{78715}{78774}You were gonna kill that guy!
{78776}{78840}Of course. I'm a Terminator.
{78906}{78986}Listen to me very carefully, okay?
{78988}{79089}You're not a Terminator anymore,|all right?
{79091}{79163}You got that?
{79165}{79234}You just can't go around|killing people.
{79236}{79266}Why?
{79296}{79360}What do you mean, why?|'Cause you can't.
{79393}{79477}Because you just can't.|Trust me on this.
{79658}{79762}Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.
{79764}{79849}I order you to help me.
{84271}{84344}You have a Sarah Connor here?
{84346}{84395}You're runnin' kind of late.
{84397}{84471}They've been in there for an hour.
{84473}{84545}Hold on a second.|I'll buzz you in.
{84598}{84714}Oh, here come your friends now.
{86566}{86670}- Gwen, you want some coffee?|- No, thanks.
{86672}{86761}- How 'bout a beer?|- Yeah, right.
{87477}{87574}- Hey, I got a full house.|- That's good, Louis.
{87576}{87645}Must be my lucky day.
{91922}{91999}You're right about number 24.
{92001}{92091}Increase the medication|to 250 milligrams.
{92093}{92179}- Same kind?|- Mm-hmm.
{92621}{92693}You!
{92769}{92827}You broke my arm.
{92829}{92912}There are 215 bones|in the human body.
{92914}{92992}That's one. Now, don't move.
{93171}{93223}What are you going to do?
{93327}{93390}Why do we stop now?
{93428}{93543}You gotta promise me|you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
{93545}{93623}- Right.|- Swear?
{93625}{93670}What?
{93672}{93765}Just put up your hand and say,|"I swear I won't kill anyone".
{93798}{93870}I swear I will not kill anyone.
{93902}{93962}All right. Let's go.
{94130}{94190}Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...
{94192}{94260}Monday through Friday.
{94371}{94408}What the hell are you doing?
{94410}{94488}You son of a bitch!|You shot me!
{94542}{94582}Crazy bastard!
{94710}{94778}Don't shoot me again.|Don't kill me.
{94885}{94943}He'll live.
{95377}{95442}Son of a bitch!
{95486}{95525}Let's try to remain calm.
{95527}{95585}Open it, or he'll be dead|before he hits the floor.
{95587}{95649}There's no way, Connor.|Let him go.
{95651}{95727}- Open the door.|- It ain't gonna happen.
{95729}{95785}Take it easy, Sarah.
{95787}{95881}It won't work. You're no killer.|I don't believe you can do it.
{95883}{95973}You're already dead. Everybody dies.|You know I believe it.
{95975}{96036}So don't fuck with me!
{96038}{96089}Open the door!
{96294}{96344}Back off!
{96346}{96389}Get back!
{96391}{96449}I'll pump him full of this shit.|I swear!
{96490}{96552}Don't move!
{96586}{96622}Drop the shit!
{96624}{96680}Do it!
{96682}{96740}Get in the office.
{96742}{96804}On the floor, face down.|Not you!
{96806}{96857}Open the door.
{96942}{96985}On the floor. Hold it open.
{96987}{97045}Face the wall!
{97524}{97579}Get her!
{98410}{98499}Hurry up! Open the door!|The door's locked!
{98532}{98588}Let's go! Open it!
{98662}{98722}- She broke it off.|- Open it!
{98884}{98953}Let's go around! Come on!|Move it!
{99917}{99950}Mom, wait!
{100154}{100185}Come back here!
{100324}{100373}- Help her!|- Wait here.
{100375}{100452}- Hurry up!|- He'll kill us all!
{100491}{100528}Hold her.
{100575}{100609}He'll kill us all!
{101275}{101345}Mom, are you okay? Mom!
{101479}{101552}Come with me|if you want to live.
{101554}{101630}It's okay, Mom.|He's here to help.
{102370}{102402}Go.
{103371}{103447}What the fuck is it?|What the fuck is going on?
{103889}{103945}Get down.
{105022}{105068}Out of the car!
{105110}{105145}Right now!
{105878}{105908}Go!
{106246}{106282}I'm out.
{106487}{106543}- Come on.|- Here.
{106620}{106682}Reload.
{106950}{107009}Last one!
{107225}{107272}Hang on.
{108058}{108104}Ready!
{108515}{108572}Here, drive.
{110167}{110234}There's nobody behind us.
{110236}{110294}- Are you all right?|- Yeah.
{110369}{110402}Can he see anything?
{110439}{110475}I see everything.
{110562}{110610}Cool.
{110719}{110777}Come here.
{110949}{111002}I said I was okay.
{111027}{111119}John, it was stupid of you|to go there.
{111149}{111217}You have to be smarter|than that.
{111219}{111267}You were almost killed.
{111304}{111355}What were you thinking?
{111383}{111462}You cannot risk yourself,|even for me.
{111464}{111510}Do you understand?
{111512}{111558}You're too important.
{111560}{111639}Do you understand?
{111726}{111759}But...
{111810}{111922}I had to get you out of that place.|I'm sorry.
{111959}{112029}I didn't need your help.
{112247}{112294}What's wrong with your eyes?
{112354}{112397}Nothing.
{112694}{112768}So, what's your story?
{113084}{113117}You okay?
{113119}{113162}Fine.
{113217}{113315}Say, that's a nice bike.
{113990}{114042}Watch it, lug nuts.
{114267}{114369}Listen, do you know|what you're doing?
{114371}{114454}I have detailed files|on human anatomy.
{114483}{114542}I bet.
{114544}{114634}Makes you a more efficient killer,|right?
{114636}{114669}Correct.
{114852}{114910}Does it hurt|when you get shot?
{114943}{115046}I sense injuries.|The data could be called "pain".
{115117}{115175}John, help me with the light.
{115177}{115246}- Will these heal up?|- Yes.
{115248}{115374}Good. If you can't pass for human,|you're not much good to us.
{115376}{115469}How long do you live?|I mean, last. Whatever.
{115471}{115559}A hundred and twenty years|with my existing power cell.
{115561}{115649}Can you learn stuff that you|haven't been programmed with...
{115651}{115694}so you can be...
{115731}{115813}you know, more human...
{115815}{115901}and not such a dork|all the time?
{115941}{116057}My CPU is a neural net processor,|a learning computer.
{116059}{116174}The more contact I have with humans,|the more I learn.
{116176}{116229}Cool.
{117173}{117231}Are we learning yet?
{117604}{117692}We have to get as far away|from the city as possible.
{117804}{117852}Just head south.
{118115}{118163}Keep it under 65.
{118165}{118253}- We don't want to be pulled over.|- Affirmative.
{118351}{118426}You gotta listen to the way|people talk.
{118428}{118534}You don't say 'affirmative'|or some shit like that.
{118536}{118604}You say, "No problemo".
{118606}{118724}If someone comes off to you|with an attitude, you say, "Eat me".
{118726}{118854}And if you want to shine them on,|it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
{118954}{119015}Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad".
{119017}{119108}If someone gets upset,|you say, "Chill out".
{119110}{119153}Or you can do combinations.
{119175}{119244}Chill out, dick-wad.
{119269}{119329}That's great.|See? You're getting it.
{119834}{119892}Want some of my fries?
{120192}{120250}Need any help?
{120252}{120302}No.
{120304}{120359}- I got you!|- No, you didn't!
{120610}{120704}We're not gonna make it,|are we?
{120761}{120798}People, I mean.
{120882}{120948}It's in your nature|to destroy yourselves.
{120980}{121068}Yeah. Major drag, huh?
{121070}{121168}Break it up before I wring|both of your necks.
{121221}{121314}I need to know|how Skynet gets built.
{121316}{121354}Who's responsible?
{121356}{121463}The man most directly responsible|is Miles Bennett Dyson.
{121465}{121517}Who is that?
{121519}{121637}He's the director of special projects|at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
{121720}{121773}Why him?
{121775}{121876}In a few months he creates|a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
{121908}{121948}Go on. Then what?
{121981}{122069}In three years Cyberdyne will become|the largest supplier...
{122071}{122113}of military computer systems.
{122145}{122233}All Stealth bombers are upgraded|with Cyberdyne computers...
{122235}{122279}becoming fully unmanned.
{122281}{122373}Afterwards they fly with|a perfect operational record.
{122375}{122455}The Skynet funding bill is passed.
{122457}{122555}The system goes on-line|on August 4, 1997.
{122557}{122653}Human decisions are removed|from strategic defense.
{122655}{122737}Skynet begins to learn|at a geometric rate.
{122739}{122868}It becomes self-aware|at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.
{122900}{122978}In a panic,|they try to pull the plug.
{123012}{123079}- Skynet fights back.|- Yes.
{123081}{123164}It launches its missiles|against the targets in Russia.
{123166}{123258}Why attack Russia?|Aren't they our friends now?
{123260}{123332}Because Skynet knows|that the Russian counterattack...
{123334}{123392}will eliminate its enemies|over here.
{123394}{123452}Jesus.
{123522}{123580}How much do you know|about Dyson?
{123644}{123702}I have detailed files.
{123738}{123796}I want to know everything.
{123833}{123955}What he looks like,|where he lives, everything.
{124797}{124855}Wait in the car.
{126000}{126051}You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
{126678}{126726}Hey, big John.
{126749}{126780}What's up?
{126823}{126856}He's cool, Enrique.
{126858}{126891}He's with me.
{126893}{126988}He's... Uncle Bob.
{126990}{127053}Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
{127055}{127112}Uncle Bob, huh?
{127144}{127182}Okay.
{127392}{127420}Drink?
{127579}{127621}"Uncle Bob"?
{127682}{127770}You're pretty famous,|all over the goddamn TV.
{127772}{127852}Pictures of you, John,|your big friend here.
{127854}{127942}Cops are going nuts|looking for you.
{128027}{128150}I just came for my stuff.|I need clothes, food and a truck.
{128152}{128210}How about the fillings in my teeth?
{128212}{128277}Now, Enrique.
{128317}{128383}You two,|you're on weapons detail.
{128385}{128436}Let's go.
{129053}{129111}One thing about my mom...
{129180}{129238}she always plans ahead.
{129565}{129598}Excellent.
{129914}{130024}This is my best truck,|but the starter motor's gone.
{130026}{130084}You got time to change it out?
{130086}{130187}Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark|to cross the border.
{130257}{130330}I grew up in places like this...
{130332}{130405}so I thought|that's how people lived...
{130407}{130517}riding around in helicopters,|learning how to blow shit up.
{130678}{130732}That's definitely you.
{131070}{131158}Most of the guys my mom|hung around with were geeks...
{131160}{131268}but there was this one guy,|he was kinda cool.
{131270}{131328}He taught me engines.
{131330}{131396}Hold here.
{131398}{131470}Mom screwed it up, of course.
{131472}{131546}She'd always tell 'em|about Judgment Day...
{131548}{131632}and me being this world leader.
{131634}{131692}That'd be all she wrote.
{131733}{131766}Torque wrench, please.
{131834}{131871}Here.
{131873}{131969}I wish I could've met|my real dad.
{131971}{132024}You will.
{132026}{132092}Yeah, I guess.
{132094}{132209}When I'm, like 45, I think.
{132211}{132323}They sent him back through time|to 1984.
{132325}{132368}Man.
{132414}{132487}He hasn't even been born yet.
{132541}{132599}It messes with your head.
{132681}{132769}- The other bolt.|- Oh. Here.
{132959}{133066}Mom and him were only together|for one night.
{133068}{133142}She still loves him, I guess.
{133144}{133231}I see her crying sometimes.
{133233}{133366}She denies it totally, of course,|like she got something stuck in her eye.
{133501}{133547}Why do you cry?
{133580}{133625}- You mean people?|- Yeah.
{133627}{133669}I don't know.
{133671}{133734}We just cry...
{133736}{133813}you know, when it hurts.
{133995}{134048}Pain causes it?
{134080}{134144}No. It's different.
{134146}{134245}It's when there's nothing wrong|with you, but you hurt anyway.
{134247}{134295}- You get it?|- No.
{134333}{134385}All right, my man!
{134439}{134487}Give me five.
{134549}{134612}Just put out your hand|like this.
{134653}{134782}All right! Now hit me.|Give me five. Do the same thing.
{134924}{134998}Okay, that's good.|Up high.
{135027}{135066}Five low.
{135089}{135117}Too slow.
{135208}{135276}I'm just kidding.|One more time.
{135278}{135345}Good. Now try it.
{135347}{135405}Now do me.|Give me five.
{135449}{135586}Watching John with the machine,|it was suddenly so clear.
{135588}{135676}The Terminator would never stop.
{135678}{135797}It would never leave him,|never hurt him...
{135799}{135902}never shout at him|or get drunk and hit him...
{135904}{135981}or be too busy|to spend time with him.
{136007}{136071}It would always be there...
{136073}{136153}and it would die|to protect him.
{136195}{136296}Of all the would-be fathers|who came and went over the years...
{136298}{136359}this thing, this machine...
{136361}{136432}was the only one|who measured up.
{136455}{136511}In an insane world...
{136513}{136571}it was the sanest choice.
{139502}{139560}Hey, let's try this one.
{139729}{139795}There we go.
{142974}{143049}She said go south with him|like you planned.
{143051}{143117}- She'll meet you tomorrow.|- Mom!
{143171}{143206}Mom, wait!
{143667}{143710}"No fate".
{143747}{143820}No fate but what we make.
{143884}{143942}My father told her this.
{144021}{144149}I made him memorize it in the future|as a message to her.
{144199}{144257}Never mind.
{144259}{144360}Okay, the whole thing goes...
{144362}{144443}The future's not set.
{144445}{144551}There's no fate but what|we make for ourselves.
{144553}{144643}She intends to change the future.
{144646}{144689}Yeah, I guess.
{144736}{144791}Oh, shit!
{144793}{144851}- Dyson.|- Yeah.
{144853}{144957}Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
{144960}{145020}She's gonna blow him away.
{145023}{145083}Come on! Let's go!
{145457}{145517}This is tactically dangerous.
{145520}{145553}Drive faster.
{145555}{145632}The T-1000 has the same files|that I do.
{145634}{145737}It knows what I know.|It might anticipate this move.
{145739}{145813}I don't care.|We gotta stop her.
{145815}{145873}Killing Dyson|might prevent the war.
{145875}{145942}I don't care!
{145944}{146002}Haven't you learned anything yet?
{146004}{146078}Haven't you figured out|why you can't kill people?
{146239}{146338}Danny, I told you to go to bed.|I'm not kidding.
{146340}{146408}Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
{146684}{146755}Danny, your time is up!
{146757}{146845}Come brush your teeth|and get to bed.
{147701}{147749}Danny!
{148097}{148138}Daddy!
{148140}{148214}Danny, go! Go!
{148261}{148297}Miles?
{148454}{148527}- Tortsia, run!|- Oh, my God!
{148739}{148799}Just take Danny and run!
{148802}{148840}Run!
{148842}{148895}Oh, Jesus! Miles!
{149461}{149491}Daddy!
{149542}{149586}Nobody fucking move!
{149611}{149649}Don't hurt my daddy!
{149651}{149697}On the floor, bitch.
{149700}{149765}Get down now!
{149791}{149824}Move!
{149826}{149869}Don't hurt him!
{149914}{149974}Get on the floor now!
{150066}{150118}Just let the boy go.
{150120}{150168}Shut up. Shut up.
{150170}{150209}Shut up!
{150211}{150289}It's all your fault, motherfucker.
{150291}{150359}- It's all your fault!|- What?
{150361}{150424}I'm not gonna let you do it.
{151983}{152047}Shit! We're too late!
{152181}{152214}Check them.
{152325}{152384}Look at me, Mom.
{152387}{152453}Are you hurt?
{152562}{152623}I almost...
{152973}{153044}It'll be okay.
{153046}{153104}We'll figure something out.|Okay?
{153152}{153202}I promise.
{153300}{153388}You came here to stop me.
{153415}{153473}Yeah, I did.
{153560}{153619}I love you, John.
{153670}{153716}I always have.
{153774}{153817}I know.
{154027}{154093}Deep penetration.
{154141}{154199}No shattered bone.
{154201}{154289}Hold here.|The pressure should stop the bleeding.
{154612}{154654}Who are you people?
{154683}{154726}Show him.
{154806}{154932}Danny, I want you to come with me|right now. Show me your room.
{156144}{156182}Oh, my God.
{156184}{156263}Now listen to me|very carefully.
{156440}{156564}Dyson listened while the Terminator|laid it all down.
{156566}{156682}Skynet. Judgment Day.
{156684}{156753}The history of things to come.
{156796}{156879}It's not every day that|you find out you're responsible...
{156881}{156966}for three billion deaths.
{156968}{157026}He took it pretty well.
{157086}{157159}I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
{157340}{157404}You're judging me...
{157406}{157479}on things I haven't even done yet.
{157606}{157669}How were we supposed to know?
{157743}{157802}Yeah.
{157804}{157876}Right.
{157878}{157942}How were you supposed to know?
{157974}{158029}Fucking men like you...
{158031}{158085}built the hydrogen bomb.
{158087}{158165}Men like you...
{158167}{158210}thought it up.
{158326}{158384}You think you're so creative.
{158427}{158520}You don't know what it's like|to really create something...
{158522}{158587}to create a life...
{158589}{158634}to feel it growing inside you.
{158637}{158725}All you know how to create|is death and destruction.
{158727}{158778}Mom!
{158780}{158893}We need to be a little more|constructive here. Okay?
{158895}{158957}We still have to stop this|from happening.
{158960}{159045}But I thought...
{159047}{159166}Aren't we changing things right now,|changing the way it goes?
{159169}{159314}That's right. There's no way I'm going|to finish the new processor. Not now.
{159316}{159419}Forget it. I'm out of it.|I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
{159422}{159479}That's not good enough.
{159481}{159539}No one must follow your work.
{159541}{159597}Right.
{159599}{159730}All right, then we have to destroy|all the stuff at the lab...
{159732}{159779}the files, the disk drives...
{159782}{159862}everything here.
{159864}{159926}Everything.
{159928}{159986}I don't care.
{160024}{160054}The chip.
{160057}{160119}- Do you know about the chip?|- What chip?
{160122}{160195}It's at Cyberdyne.|It's from the other one like you.
{160197}{160279}The CPU from the first Terminator.
{160281}{160353}Son of a bitch!|I knew it!
{160355}{160437}They told us not to ask|where they got it.
{160439}{160509}Those lying motherfuckers.
{160511}{160565}It's scary stuff.|Radically advanced.
{160567}{160602}It was smashed.
{160604}{160713}It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,|took us in new directions.
{160715}{160774}Things we would've never...
{160840}{160902}All my work was based on it.
{160905}{160959}It must be destroyed.
{161027}{161117}Can you get us in?|Past security?
{161120}{161181}I think so, yeah. When?
{161329}{161362}Now?
{161477}{161568}The future,|always so clear to me...
{161571}{161660}had become like|a black highway at night.
{161663}{161745}We were in|uncharted territory now...
{161747}{161835}making up history|as we went along.
{162983}{163041}Carl, right?
{163081}{163184}Friends from out of town.|I just thought I'd...
{163186}{163246}take 'em upstairs|and show 'em around.
{163249}{163348}Mr. Dyson, you know the rules|concerning visitors in the lab.
{163350}{163414}I need written authorization...
{163446}{163506}I insist.
{163509}{163562}Don't even think about it.
{163890}{163933}It's okay.
{163976}{164070}It takes two keys, turned|simultaneously, to open the vault.
{164072}{164160}The other one is in a locker|at the security station.
{164200}{164243}Gibbons?
{164335}{164390}Gibbons! Come on, man!
{164392}{164485}You can't leave the desk|like that!
{164630}{164674}Oh, shit.
{165201}{165261}My card should access this.
{165401}{165474}- What is it?|- Damn it.
{165476}{165535}The silent alarm's been tripped.
{165720}{165802}It's neutralized all the codes|in the entire building.
{165804}{165862}Nothing will open anywhere now.
{165894}{165950}We have to abort.
{166046}{166148}We go all the way.|Okay?
{166212}{166327}You guys get started on the lab.|I can open this.
{166329}{166402}- I think it's that guy from the mall.|- It is.
{166404}{166462}It's him and the woman.
{166509}{166605}Just send everything|you got in the area right now.
{166671}{166774}I have a personal entry code|for the lab. It may still work.
{166909}{166942}It's no good.
{166944}{166988}Let me try mine.
{167139}{167201}John, fire in the hole!
{167562}{167707}Wait! You can't go in there.|The fire set off the Halon system.
{167921}{167995}You have to wait|until the gas clears.
{168070}{168108}Put this on.
{168527}{168602}All right, let's get to work.
{169237}{169336}All units in the vicinity|and all units able to respond...
{169338}{169483}a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,|the Cyberdyne building.
{169485}{169535}Suspect one is white female...
{169537}{169640}identified as last name Connor,|first name Sarah.
{169643}{169731}Escaped last night|from Pescadero State Hospital.
{169733}{169839}Suspect two: White male fitting|description of the individual...
{169842}{169945}wanted for the murder|of police officers in 1984.
{169947}{170005}Suspects are armed|and considered extremely...
{171576}{171627}All right.
{171629}{171682}7-2-5-6.
{171892}{171932}Easy money.
{172075}{172118}Uh-oh.
{172200}{172273}Oh, shit. Not good.
{172425}{172474}How we doing?
{172476}{172527}Primer cord is set.
{172529}{172602}One more barrel,|two more minutes.
{172719}{172807}- How do we set them off?|- Remote control.
{172809}{172881}Piece of cake.
{172883}{172928}- We got company.|- Police?
{172931}{173032}- How many?|- All of 'em, I think.
{173034}{173075}Go. I'll finish here.
{173135}{173178}Come on.
{173210}{173268}I'll take care of the police.
{173270}{173309}Wait! You swore!
{173398}{173441}Trust me.
{173839}{173888}You at the window!
{173890}{173993}Drop your weapon and place your hands|on top of your head!
{174034}{174089}Holy shit!
{174091}{174136}That's a mini-gun!
{174804}{174874}- Come on!|- Oh, shit!
{174876}{174922}Go! Go! Go!
{176349}{176392}Fire!
{176912}{176962}Same time, to the left.
{176964}{177034}One, two, three, go.
{177398}{177483}In order to get that out...
{177686}{177769}We got Skynet by the balls now.
{177771}{177822}Come on, let's book.
{177856}{177901}Hold your fire!
{178664}{178724}- Ready to rock?|- Ready.
{178834}{178873}Time to go.
{178875}{178919}Now.
{178921}{179010}- Take this. They'll use gas.|- Come on.
{179012}{179105}Get started on the door.|Miles, hand me the detonator.
{179832}{179915}Mom! Mom!
{181245}{181277}Shit!
{181321}{181409}She's in the clean room.|There's no way outta there.
{181695}{181723}Get down!
{181948}{181991}Here.
{182756}{182859}I don't know how much longer|I can hold this.
{182984}{183028}Fall back!
{183031}{183078}Everybody out!
{183081}{183138}Fall back now!|Go! Go! Go!
{184200}{184258}We got a war zone here!
{185215}{185266}Shut your eyes.
{185464}{185559}Stay here. I'll be back.
{185793}{185863}Get down on the floor!|Face down!
{185945}{185990}On the floor now!
{186062}{186106}Okay, drop him!
{188501}{188544}Here, hold this.
{189047}{189094}Holy shit!
{189547}{189575}Go!
{190742}{190766}Shit!
{191177}{191227}Get out.
{191798}{191838}Listen.
{191840}{191921}No matter what happens,|stay under these vests.
{191923}{191962}- You got it?|- Yeah.
{191964}{192007}All right.
{192443}{192481}Chopper's coming in!
{192483}{192515}It's him.
{194248}{194289}Shit!
{194375}{194429}Stay down!
{196655}{196708}Goddamn!
{196710}{196727}You okay...
{196953}{197026}Come on, Mom,|we gotta get out.
{197083}{197132}Take the shotgun.
{197246}{197275}Are you hurt?
{197672}{197700}Holy shit.
{197702}{197760}Come on, Mom. Come on!
{197762}{197796}We need your truck.
{197798}{197842}Hurry!
{197993}{198068}- Come on. Hurry.|- Get in.
{198158}{198373}Go!
{198375}{198434}What the hell...
{198611}{198694}- I'm bleeding bad.|- Keep pressure on it.
{198744}{198793}Here. This'll work.
{198961}{199011}He's gaining.
{199088}{199139}Step on it!
{199141}{199225}- This is the vehicle's top speed.|- I can run faster than this!
{199550}{199593}Coming up, to the right.
{199655}{199713}Watch it! Watch it!
{200390}{200452}- Drive.|- Where are you going?
{200677}{200735}Take the off-ramp.

{202990}{203014}Duck!
{203458}{203516}Get the hell outta here!
{203682}{203773}Get outta here!|Let's go! Come on!
{206081}{206155}Hasta la vista, baby.
{207639}{207682}We don't have much time.
{208361}{208399}Let's go.
{208431}{208483}We gotta get outta here.
{208485}{208547}Come on! Get up!
{208955}{209007}Hand me the shotgun.
{209151}{209219}Put your weight on me, Mom.
{209244}{209301}Hurry!
{209408}{209456}Come on, Mom.
{209652}{209691}Get up!
{210171}{210229}This way. Come on.
{210568}{210648}Wait! No. No. It's too hot.
{210650}{210688}Go back.
{210934}{211002}- Go. Run.|- No! We gotta stick together.
{211004}{211063}John, you've got to go now.
{211066}{211131}- John!|- Go! Now!
{213359}{213416}Get up the steps.
{213475}{213518}Go.
{213638}{213681}Get up.
{213706}{213768}Come on, Mom.|I got you.
{214802}{214872}Grab the chain. Grab it.
{214914}{214994}Grab it. Go. Go!
{215305}{215403}Mom, come on! Mom!
{216877}{216931}Call to John.
{217015}{217070}I know this hurts.
{217125}{217173}Call John.
{217666}{217744}Call to John now.
{217808}{217863}Fuck you.
{223784}{223827}Help!
{224443}{224490}Mom.
{224542}{224600}Help me.
{224679}{224717}Get out of the way, John.
{224719}{224748}Shoot!
{226391}{226464}Get down!
{229260}{229324}Get up. Come on.
{229393}{229447}Holy shit.
{229449}{229522}I need a vacation.
{229919}{230003}Is it dead?
{230005}{230048}Terminated.
{230150}{230202}Will this melt in there?
{230291}{230347}Yes. Throw it in.
{230560}{230618}And the chip.
{231073}{231120}It's over.
{231326}{231375}There's one more chip.
{231516}{231584}And it must be destroyed also.
{231747}{231794}Here.
{231797}{231899}I cannot self-terminate.|You must lower me into the steel.
{232293}{232367}I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
{232369}{232437}No, it'll be okay.|Stay with us.
{232439}{232499}- It'll be okay.|- I have to go away.
{232502}{232579}No, don't do it.|Please, don't go.
{232582}{232673}I must go away, John.
{232676}{232720}No, wait.
{232723}{232767}You don't have to do this.
{232770}{232810}I'm sorry.
{232838}{232906}No, don't do it! Don't go!
{232908}{232966}It has to end here.
{233003}{233101}I order you not to go!
{233340}{233400}I know now why you cry.
{233473}{233547}But it's something|I can never do.
{234575}{234640}Good-bye.
{237610}{237701}The unknown future|rolls toward us.
{237704}{237822}I face it for the first time|with a sense of hope.
{237824}{237895}Because if a machine,|a Terminator...
{237897}{237999}can learn the value|of human life...
{238001}{238074}maybe we can too.
