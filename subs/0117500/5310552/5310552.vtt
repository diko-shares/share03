00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.230
<i>We can't hold out much longer, sir!</i>

2
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.880
<i>General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!</i>

3
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.600
<i>I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.</i>

4
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.810
<i>Goddam it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost fifteen men already!</i>

5
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.530
<i>Sir, they're lightin' us up like a firestorm!</i>

6
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.900
<i>This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!</i>

7
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.530
<i>We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.</i>

8
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.370
<i>They're not coming for us, are they, sir?</i>

9
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.970
<i>Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,</i>

10
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.720
<i>I come before you to protest a grave injustice.</i>

11
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.770
Aim!

12
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.150
<i>It has to stop.</i>

13
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.660
I miss you so much.

14
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.670
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

15
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.590
Something I couldn't do while you were here.

16
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.600
I tried. You know I tried everything.

17
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.930
And I still don't have their attention.

18
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.900
Let's hope this elevates their thinking.

19
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.400
But whatever happens,

20
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.030
please don't think less of me.

21
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.060
Marine, inform the garrison C.O.

22
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.870
that General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

23
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.628
Yes, sir.

24
00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:32.435
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

25
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.240
Ya know, at least we can get some...

26
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.360
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

27
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.720
I got the access card. We've got thirty
minutes till those darts wear off.

28
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.930
Move it!

29
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.640
The access card, sir.

30
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.270
Let's do it.

31
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.400
2400 magazine check.

32
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.630
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

33
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.980
Clear!

34
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.210
- I want sixteen, Major!
- Move it!

35
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.080
Evac! Seal the door!

36
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.751
- No!
- Come on, man!

37
00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:17.354
- No!
- Seal it!

38
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.018
- No!
- Seal it!

39
00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:20.274
Help!

40
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.920
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

41
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.090
<i>Let me out! Let me out!</i>

42
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.260
Clear out. Get outta here!

43
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.930
Sorry.

44
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.610
Let's move out.

45
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.410
Two more CC's of acetylene chloride.

46
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.630
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

47
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.220
You guys have too much time on your hands.

48
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.230
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

49
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.610
What's that? Why'd you get it sent here?

50
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.820
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

51
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.240
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

52
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.490
First of all, it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

53
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.000
And second, these sound better.

54
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.170
Could be serious. Could be sarin gas.

55
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.380
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

56
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.380
postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.

57
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.800
It could be detergent, or it could be sarin gas.

58
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.260
Bosnian refugee camp?

59
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.720
Half a million Serbians reside in the
U.S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

60
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.020
You guys wanna get suited up?

61
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.770
<i>- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.</i>

62
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.900
<i>We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.</i>

63
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.700
<i>October 1, 0900 hours.</i>

64
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.500
<i>Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...</i>

65
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.830
<i>initiating exam of wooden crate.</i>

66
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.380
<i>Suspicion of sarin gas inside.</i>

67
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.920
<i>- Marvin, sarin is a?
- G.B. aerosol.</i>

68
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.760
<i>That is correct.</i>

69
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.090
<i>Now, let's see. We have some dirty magazines.</i>

70
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.100
<i>Stone Age Cave Girls in the Raw. Kinky.</i>

71
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.390
<i>And, uh, not a good sign.</i>

72
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.600
<i>Hello, little baby doll.</i>

73
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.730
<i>Look it, Stan.</i>

74
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.940
<i>- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin! Marvin, don't!</i>

75
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:57.070
<i>- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!</i>

76
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.160
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

77
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.760
We'll have that room clear in
fifty seconds! You're gonna be okay.

78
00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:05.744
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

79
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.790
<i>Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.</i>

80
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.300
<i>The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.</i>

81
00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.510
<i>- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news</i>

82
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.300
<i>is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber</i>

83
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:22.773
<i>and kill everybody in the building.</i>

84
00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.183
<i>- Detonation: two minutes.</i>
- Everybody, out of the room now!

85
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.587
Seal us inside.

86
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.940
<i>- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su...</i>

87
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.490
<i>It's eating my fucking suit! All right? Shit!</i>

88
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.780
<i>- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?</i>

89
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.230
We're working on it. It's coming.
It's just a flow problem.

90
00:10:43.254 --> 00:10:45.830
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

91
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.510
We're working on it! How much
time do you have on that detonator?

92
00:10:48.534 --> 00:10:49.105
<i>A minute ten.</i>

93
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.370
<i>- Look at this!</i>
- We're gonna have the room clear.

94
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.540
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

95
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.380
<i>- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!</i>

96
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:58.875
Marvin, the atropine, now!

97
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.784
Inject it in your heart before your suit melts.

98
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.350
<i>Shit!</i>

99
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.260
Make him take his dose.

100
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.730
<i>- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!</i>

101
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.350
Come on, Phil, fix it for Christ's sake!

102
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.211
Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!

103
00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:17.225
We're fucked.

104
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.029
<i>The poison's mixing.</i>

105
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.820
What the fuck are you waiting for,
Stanley? You take the fucking needle now!

106
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.530
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

107
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.080
If that suit melts... If you die, we all die!

108
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.810
Inject your heart and then diffuse the bomb!

109
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:32.870
Come on, just do it, Stan!

110
00:11:32.872 --> 00:11:34.984
<i>Shit! What if I miss my heart? I can't see shit!</i>

111
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.313
Do it now!

112
00:11:36.338 --> 00:11:40.035
<i>Look how big this is. You want
me to stick this into my heart?</i>

113
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.590
<i>- Are you fucking nuts?</i>
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

114
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.800
Okay, here we go, man!

115
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.520
Sprinkler activated.

116
00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:52.165
How much time left?

117
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.810
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

118
00:11:56.614 --> 00:11:58.020
We're not gonna make it.

119
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.424
<i>Fifteen.</i>

120
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.765
Oh, come on.

121
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.558
<i>Clear!</i>

122
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.000
<i>Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!</i>

123
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.040
<i>I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.</i>

124
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.630
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

125
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.300
Hi, baby.

126
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.140
I had such an interesting day today.

127
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.560
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.

128
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.020
Oh, okay, you go first.

129
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:41.440
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies,

130
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.660
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

131
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.370
So I took the rest of the day off.

132
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.580
Glass of wine, little guitar. Just relaxing.

133
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.055
Wow!

134
00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.144
I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

135
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.290
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about having a

136
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.920
child in this world is coldly
considering an act of cruelty.

137
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.880
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

138
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.300
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

139
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.680
I'm sorry?

140
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.690
I'm pregnant.

141
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

142
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.480
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

143
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.070
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

144
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.410
How do you know? I mean, h-how do you know?

145
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.160
Blue! Just turned blue so I went to the doctor.

146
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.540
Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?

147
00:13:37.565 --> 00:13:38.314
When?

148
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.620
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

149
00:13:41.644 --> 00:13:43.460
and having it be an act of cruelty.

150
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:44.780
I meant it at the time.

151
00:13:45.205 --> 00:13:47.774
Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

152
00:13:48.496 --> 00:13:50.110
Well, gosh!

153
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.430
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

154
00:13:55.158 --> 00:13:57.256
I know. It's funny you should mention that.

155
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.624
It's funny?

156
00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.584
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

157
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.050
Good.

158
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.850
Will you marry me?

159
00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:11.594
Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey,
Marriage Police, pull over!

160
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.620
Come on, Stanley. I'm proposing to you right now.

161
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.300
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

162
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.890
Is it really true that there's never been an escape?

163
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.180
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed,

164
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.100
there were fourteen attempts.

165
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:42.860
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

166
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.140
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

167
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:48.439
I don't really give a shit! Do you give a shit?

168
00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.073
No.

169
00:14:49.436 --> 00:14:50.907
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

170
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.707
Hey, girls?

171
00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:54.948
Hi. You all havin' a good time?

172
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:55.887
Yeah.

173
00:14:55.888 --> 00:14:58.646
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

174
00:14:58.647 --> 00:15:00.407
I need you to tell your teacher that you need

175
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.231
to get back on the boat and go home right now.

176
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.590
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!

177
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.670
This cell block housed

178
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.340
the most awesome scum in America.

179
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.050
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,

180
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.850
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

181
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.008
On the line!

182
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.436
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they, huh?

183
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.967
Like being a caged animal.

184
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.093
Spend a couple of years in there...

185
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.020
What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?

186
00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:37.049
The tour's over, Bob.

187
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.540
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

188
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.270
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

189
00:16:04.163 --> 00:16:05.403
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.

190
00:16:05.427 --> 00:16:07.986
Land the choppers on the back
side and deploy as planned.

191
00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:09.858
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

192
00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:11.690
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

193
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:14.530
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddam gun.

194
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.700
If I'd've known this was gonna happen,
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

195
00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:18.724
Help!

196
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.306
All right, gentlemen, this'll be our new home.

197
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.944
Tom, I want my command center right here.

198
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.180
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

199
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.640
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

200
00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:41.229
Let's move it.

201
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.240
Systems up.

202
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.344
Possible penetration point in the shower room.

203
00:16:56.203 --> 00:16:58.803
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

204
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.910
It's an anti-motion trembler device.
It's custom-made.

205
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.620
Nobody knows about it and nobody expects it.

206
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.090
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

207
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.170
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

208
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.439
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
being detained against your will.

209
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.530
For that, I apologize.

210
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.481
It is not our intention in any way to harm you.

211
00:17:35.482 --> 00:17:37.359
You will not be detained one minute longer than

212
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.195
is necessary for us to complete our mission.

213
00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.243
Attention on deck!

214
00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.635
Stand easy, men.

215
00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.340
Make no mistake about it,
gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

216
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.201
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last

217
00:17:58.226 --> 00:18:00.454
campaign in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

218
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.988
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

219
00:18:05.989 --> 00:18:08.477
who cut their teeth under
my command in Desert Storm.

220
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.296
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow, this is my first

221
00:18:11.297 --> 00:18:13.017
operational situation with you and your men.

222
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.681
And I have to say, thus far your
conduct reflects your reputations.

223
00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:17.593
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

224
00:18:17.594 --> 00:18:20.780
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

225
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.950
To this we must now add resolve.

226
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.500
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

227
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.750
Punishable by death.

228
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.090
A couple hundred years ago,

229
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.710
a few guys named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

230
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.130
were branded as traitors by the British.

231
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.010
And now they're called patriots.

232
00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.140
In time, so shall we.

233
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.108
God willing, in less than 48 hours

234
00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:50.062
you will evacuate this island in gunships under

235
00:18:50.063 --> 00:18:52.550
cover of hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

236
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.154
Your destination: a non-extradition treaty country.

237
00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.597
You will each be paid a fee of
$1 million for services rendered.

238
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.111
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

239
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.660
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

240
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.540
The men of Marine Force Recon

241
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:14.250
are selected to carry out illegal
operations throughout the world.

242
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.768
When they don't come home,

243
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.590
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them

244
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.890
and denied compensation.

245
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:28.390
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career!

246
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.020
Well, here and now the lies stop!

247
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.610
God be with all of you. Man your positions, men.

248
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.910
This is FBI Director Womack.

249
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.021
Director, be advised.

250
00:19:51.364 --> 00:19:53.420
Eighty-one, I say again,

251
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.340
Eighty-one civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

252
00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.670
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

253
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.180
Who is this?

254
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.010
Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

255
00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.453
A battery of V.X. gas rockets is presently deployed

256
00:20:09.454 --> 00:20:13.230
to deliver a highly lethal strike on the
population of the San Francisco Bay area.

257
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.428
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.

258
00:20:16.429 --> 00:20:18.143
I want to know who I'm talking to.

259
00:20:18.144 --> 00:20:20.085
This is Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel,

260
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.964
United States Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

261
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.422
Out!

262
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.490
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

263
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.747
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

264
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.460
<i>Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force</i>

265
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.670
under the guise of a security exercise,
walked off with 15 V.X. poison gas rockets.

266
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.390
He lost one of his own men in the process.

267
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.720
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

268
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.020
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

269
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.980
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars

270
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.810
and the Congressional Medal of...

271
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.110
Jesus! This man is a hero!

272
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.525
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

273
00:21:04.526 --> 00:21:07.981
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

274
00:21:07.982 --> 00:21:10.616
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel is a man of honor.

275
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.080
General, it's him.

276
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.170
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

277
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.130
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

278
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.970
<i>I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.</i>

279
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.470
Got a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.

280
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.444
I'll come straight to the point.

281
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.010
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

282
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.470
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China.

283
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.770
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

284
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.100
<i>Who is this? Identify yourself.</i>

285
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.816
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.

286
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.950
- How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm thirty-three.

287
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.958
<i>Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.</i>

288
00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:53.606
<i>By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China,</i>

289
00:21:53.607 --> 00:21:56.593
<i>and my men were responsible for
over two hundred enemy kills.</i>

290
00:21:56.877 --> 00:22:00.750
<i>Al, put some rigging tape over Mr. Sinclair's
mouth. He's wasting my time.</i>

291
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.340
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

292
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.590
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

293
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:09.111
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

294
00:22:09.753 --> 00:22:13.220
<i>It was my men on the ground that made
those hits possible by lasing the targets.</i>

295
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.770
<i>Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.</i>

296
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.400
No benefits were paid to their families.

297
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.900
<i>No medals conferred.</i>

298
00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:25.332
<i>These men died for their country, and they</i>

299
00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:27.522
<i>weren't even given a
goddam military burial.</i>

300
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:34.415
<i>The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million</i>

301
00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:37.576
<i>from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading
Company account to an account I designate.</i>

302
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.838
<i>From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid</i>

303
00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.960
<i>to each of the eighty-three Marines' families.</i>

304
00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.460
<i>The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.</i>

305
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.090
Do I make myself clear?

306
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.300
Except for the Red Sea
Trading Company. What is that?

307
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.119
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

308
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.625
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

309
00:22:59.626 --> 00:23:02.500
Jesus, Frank! This is classified information.

310
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.316
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

311
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.360
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

312
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.818
<i>You've got forty hours, till noon day after
tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.</i>

313
00:23:12.998 --> 00:23:16.330
<i>I am aware of your countermeasure. You
know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.</i>

314
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.250
<i>Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.</i>

315
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.170
All right. We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

316
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.220
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

317
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.548
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco

318
00:23:31.573 --> 00:23:33.534
will be in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

319
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.180
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

320
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:42.092
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. poison gas, General Peterson?

321
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.610
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

322
00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.570
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

323
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.330
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

324
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.250
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

325
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.290
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

326
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.710
Get the point?

327
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:07.340
Uh, what did Hummel mean by
your countermeasure, General?

328
00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.630
Standard poison is countered by napalm. It
burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

329
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.050
Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas is

330
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.550
that it's designed specifically to withstand napalm.

331
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.140
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

332
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.060
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,

333
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.730
but they're still in the test phase;
it's not operational.

334
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.280
Hummel knows this. We are dealing
with one smart son of a bitch.

335
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.160
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

336
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.990
within the next thirty-six hours?

337
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.580
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

338
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.750
All right, we can try.

339
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.210
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

340
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.621
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

341
00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:54.180
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

342
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.970
Mr. Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

343
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.365
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.

344
00:25:02.366 --> 00:25:03.598
That's very compelling.

345
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.927
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails are very naughty.

346
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.910
Naughty. Naughty.

347
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.410
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

348
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.910
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

349
00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.040
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

350
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.250
I have to. It's the office,
baby. They know I'm home.

351
00:25:28.274 --> 00:25:28.905
No.

352
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.630
How could they possibly know that you're home?

353
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.920
It's the FBI.

354
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:37.717
Stanley!

355
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.571
Goodspeed. Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

356
00:25:41.572 --> 00:25:43.732
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

357
00:25:43.756 --> 00:25:46.216
No, you won't.

358
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.610
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

359
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.820
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

360
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.100
Are you kidding me right now? You need
to stay here and talk to me about things.

361
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.740
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

362
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:06.040
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

363
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.120
I cannot believe you.

364
00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.050
No, no.

365
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.520
I love you. I will marry you.

366
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.350
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

367
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.480
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

368
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.977
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

369
00:26:33.978 --> 00:26:35.900
Check into the hotel. Order up some champagne.

370
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.990
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

371
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.870
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

372
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:42.660
You're gonna marry me!

373
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:45.058
Oh, honey, come on. Just a really quick one.

374
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:46.524
Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

375
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.433
A night-time airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

376
00:26:50.434 --> 00:26:52.131
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.

377
00:26:52.132 --> 00:26:55.090
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

378
00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:58.430
Our only alternative is an
attack from within the prison.

379
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.066
We penetrate the island through the tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected

380
00:27:02.067 --> 00:27:05.266
and emerge in its center; that way
we can jump the Marines from behind.

381
00:27:05.267 --> 00:27:08.542
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

382
00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:11.427
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

383
00:27:11.428 --> 00:27:14.900
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

384
00:27:15.616 --> 00:27:18.853
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

385
00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:21.283
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

386
00:27:21.284 --> 00:27:24.030
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

387
00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.433
All the guards we contacted were useless.

388
00:27:27.008 --> 00:27:31.330
Um, there is someone who I think can help us.

389
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.098
This is for the sake of national security.

390
00:27:37.099 --> 00:27:38.779
No! It's the sake of national security that

391
00:27:38.803 --> 00:27:41.262
got us here in the first
place thirty-three years ago.

392
00:27:41.263 --> 00:27:43.939
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

393
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.260
Forget it! He does not exist.

394
00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.850
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for thirty years.

395
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.951
We locked him up and threw away the key.

396
00:27:51.952 --> 00:27:53.871
Oh, and a lot of goddam good it did us.

397
00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:57.764
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons. And if he hits the streets.

398
00:27:57.765 --> 00:27:59.320
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

399
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.450
Thirty years ago he was a
highly trained SAS operative.

400
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.135
He is my age now, for Christ's sake!

401
00:28:05.136 --> 00:28:07.586
I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.

402
00:28:08.504 --> 00:28:10.540
We can't risk letting him out.

403
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.680
<i>He's a professional escape artist.</i>

404
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.847
- Gosh. Neat, uh...
- Yeah.

405
00:28:50.848 --> 00:28:51.829
Neat, neat plane.

406
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.544
Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

407
00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:54.210
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.

408
00:28:54.235 --> 00:28:54.838
Thank you.

409
00:28:54.839 --> 00:28:57.218
You come very highly recommended.

410
00:28:57.219 --> 00:28:59.960
B.A. Columbia; M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

411
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.130
Biochemistry, toxicology.

412
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.760
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

413
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.274
Got my first chemistry set when
I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

414
00:29:08.275 --> 00:29:11.061
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

415
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.533
What do you know about V.X. gas?

416
00:29:13.534 --> 00:29:16.455
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

417
00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:18.231
Uh, actually, it's kind of like champagne that way.

418
00:29:18.232 --> 00:29:20.176
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

419
00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:22.166
Somehow the bottle carbonated. Voilá! Champagne.

420
00:29:22.167 --> 00:29:24.487
- And then the whole thing just...
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

421
00:29:25.229 --> 00:29:26.450
It's very, very horrible, sir.

422
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.870
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

423
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:32.500
This isn't a "train exercise", is it?

424
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.040
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it's not a training exercise.

425
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.210
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

426
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.080
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in
charge of the West Coast operation.

427
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.983
Dr. Goodspeed.

428
00:30:20.008 --> 00:30:22.325
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

429
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.800
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

430
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.950
Now, my boys, they haven't been able to find

431
00:30:28.975 --> 00:30:30.914
a file on this guy. Who is he anyway, sir?

432
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:33.850
His name is John Mason, a British national

433
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.940
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962, escaped in '63.

434
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.660
I was under the impression that
no one ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

435
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:43.980
Paxton, don't argue!

436
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.200
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

437
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.870
He does not exist. Understand?

438
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.200
I want one thing: how he escaped the Rock.

439
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.370
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

440
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:57.769
The papers are in order, sir.

441
00:30:57.794 --> 00:30:59.894
We're prepared to offer him a full pardon.

442
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.590
And Paxton, no strong-arming
Mason. I know him too well.

443
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.050
Well, if you know him, then
why don't you question him?

444
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.800
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

445
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.350
All right, I'll take care of him.

446
00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.940
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

447
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:30.320
In charge of what? Fucking me
over for another three decades?

448
00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.410
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

449
00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.490
a special situation exists that we
feel you might be able to help us with.

450
00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.870
Well, what might that be?

451
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.217
I've been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

452
00:31:41.242 --> 00:31:43.314
so maybe you want me to run for president.

453
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.670
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

454
00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.760
I feel rather like Alcamedes.

455
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.965
<i>Who?</i>

456
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.244
<i>Alcamedes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.</i>

457
00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:57.560
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
- James the First.

458
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.190
<i>Even someone as bright as
you must be aware that, uh,</i>

459
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.480
<i>there's a certain pattern emerging here.</i>

460
00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.690
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

461
00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.150
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

462
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.410
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

463
00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:15.240
I don't like you any more than you like me.

464
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:17.700
But I'm here to make you a legitimate offer.

465
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.000
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?

466
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.790
<i>By all means, dear Paxton. By all means.</i>

467
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.210
<i>We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.</i>

468
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.130
<i>There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.</i>

469
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:33.720
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

470
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.260
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?

471
00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.270
Why don't we cut the shit, huh? You know the Rock.

472
00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.730
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

473
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.810
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favor while you're helpin' us?

474
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.780
I mean, it'd be nice to get out
of jail while you're still vertical.

475
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.030
Hmm? While you got a little
lead left in your pencil.

476
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.530
While I'm considering your offer,

477
00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.830
<i>I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

478
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.670
You know I'm here to cut you a deal.

479
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.880
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

480
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.720
Here. Here's a quarter.

481
00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:21.720
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

482
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.990
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

483
00:33:28.014 --> 00:33:30.190
I'm just givin' him somethin' to think about.

484
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.990
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

485
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.910
for him to just sit around and think about it.

486
00:33:33.934 --> 00:33:36.820
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

487
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:38.106
You go talk to him.

488
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.131
- Me?
- Yes.

489
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.740
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

490
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.960
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

491
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.790
Don't mention that!

492
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.840
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

493
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:57.640
We got less than 24 hours. Give it a shot.

494
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.260
Okay.

495
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.480
Hi.

496
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.610
I'm an agent with the, uh, uh, F-Federal-

497
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.570
FBI. Uh...

498
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:19.410
- Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

499
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:21.990
Well, at least he got his name right.

500
00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.830
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

501
00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.290
That's right.

502
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.630
And you need my help.

503
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.380
Exactly right.

504
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.220
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

505
00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.300
Offer me coffee.

506
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.060
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

507
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.890
Can we get a cup of coffee in here, please?

508
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.730
And offer to take these off.

509
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.480
<i>Mr. Mason, really.</i>

510
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.030
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

511
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.498
<i>Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.</i>

512
00:35:01.523 --> 00:35:02.604
No, no, no, no.

513
00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.350
<i>Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?</i>

514
00:35:07.374 --> 00:35:09.994
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

515
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.090
This is a pardon and release contract
from the attorney general's office.

516
00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:20.220
Now, it makes you a free man provided you cooperate.

517
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.680
So if you'll just, uh, sign,

518
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.770
uh, at, uh, where it says-

519
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.100
- "Signature"?
- That's... Yes. "Signature."

520
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:34.150
Well, <i>timeo danaos et dona ferentis.</i>

521
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.280
"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

522
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.990
Oh, an educated man!

523
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:45.160
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

524
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.120
In point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

525
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.540
- Really?
- Yes.

526
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.290
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

527
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.460
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

528
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.470
Well-trained.

529
00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.510
<i>Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

530
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.060
<i>Okay.</i>

531
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.060
I want a suite, a shower, a shave...

532
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.020
and the feel of a suit.

533
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.320
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

534
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.515
Am I out of style?

535
00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.764
Unless you're a twenty year old
guitarist from Seattle.

536
00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.030
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

537
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.120
<i>Yeah, well, uh, uh...
Okay, thank you very much.</i>

538
00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.688
All right. Call the Fairmont. Close the floor

539
00:36:30.713 --> 00:36:32.894
if necessary, but I want him sealed off.

540
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.920
And he gets two hours max.

541
00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:51.640
Great job, Goodspeed.

542
00:36:51.665 --> 00:36:54.274
Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

543
00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:56.056
I'll deliver this to the attorney general.

544
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.370
Uh, no, you'll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.

545
00:36:58.394 --> 00:37:02.874
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.
There's a car waiting for you. Thank you.

546
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:08.280
That's a signed federal document,
sir. Isn't that illegal?

547
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.910
You're not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.

548
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.380
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

549
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:20.800
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know.

550
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.930
It's, uh, it's, eh, kind of curious, but, uh,

551
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.300
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamedes, Solzhenitsyn,

552
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.260
they, um, well, they were all wrongfully imprisoned.

553
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.360
Womack! Now, why am I not
surprised, you piece of shit!

554
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.740
Eh, peace! Peace!

555
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:55.580
<i>Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.</i>

556
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.830
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

557
00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.960
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.

558
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.510
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

559
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.194
- Stanley, no!
<i>- Carla.</i>

560
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.720
- Carla.
<i>- Like hell I'm not coming!</i>

561
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.260
Wait. Car...

562
00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:17.600
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

563
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.610
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

564
00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.660
Watch it, he'll bite you.

565
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.420
Good. Mobile Command is fully operational.

566
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.230
We'll be there in approximately two hours.

567
00:38:43.255 --> 00:38:44.173
I'm not armed, sir.

568
00:38:44.198 --> 00:38:45.075
Right.

569
00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:47.760
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

570
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.140
I left it in my, uh, my sock drawer.

571
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.140
A gun?

572
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.900
For what? You're a chemical freak.

573
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:03.480
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

574
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.740
Give him a goddam gun.

575
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.870
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

576
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.980
Uh, uh, room service?

577
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.570
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

578
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.820
Hello!

579
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.200
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

580
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.820
Barber.

581
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.062
Just clippers. No scissors.

582
00:39:55.063 --> 00:39:57.260
No scissors? You've got to
be kidding me, no scissors!

583
00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:59.210
I mean, did they tell Picasso, "no brush"?

584
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.120
With scissors, this man could kill you.

585
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:06.000
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

586
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.170
Why don't we do this outside? Get some sun.

587
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:15.510
Oh, who did this to you? This is just
not right. In fact, it's nasty!

588
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.430
Well, it's a grunge thing.

589
00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.680
Well, it's some kind of thing.

590
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.770
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

591
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.020
No.

592
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.990
Okay. Not very nice, is he?

593
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.030
No, he's not.

594
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.510
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

595
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:53.470
Don't you ever stop eatin'?

596
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:55.970
Not when it's free.

597
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:59.310
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

598
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.310
The boss is watchin' him. Come on, have...
Try some of this lobster.

599
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.730
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

600
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:10.150
So what do you have in store for
me, Womack, when this is over?

601
00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.070
You'll get your life back, Mason.

602
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.030
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

603
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:24.920
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

604
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:28.170
Will you shake on it?

605
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.020
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

606
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.810
Help!

607
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.770
Drop the gun or I drop your boss.

608
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.070
You will not!

609
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.030
Get!

610
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.740
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

611
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.120
Please don't!

612
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.000
Help! Shit!

613
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:08.840
Come on, have a scallop. Come on, catch.

614
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.180
You hoist him!

615
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.220
Help! Help! Help!

616
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.470
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

617
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.978
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!

618
00:42:26.003 --> 00:42:27.003
Gone?

619
00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:30.980
Clear.

620
00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.860
Living room's clear!

621
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.240
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

622
00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.200
All units, this is Caretaker. We
have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

623
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.840
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.

624
00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.904
I never saw you throw that
gentleman off the balcony.

625
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.170
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

626
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.680
Easy!

627
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:03.100
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

628
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.850
Watch out!

629
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:13.520
Oh, no!

630
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.700
Watch it!

631
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:29.500
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

632
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.890
Hey!

633
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.018
This is my Humvee. I don't want any dings, dents

634
00:43:51.043 --> 00:43:53.544
or scratches, or I'll have your ass. Hey!

635
00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:55.230
Hey! Stop! Hey!

636
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.620
Hey, I was inside the bedroom with Jack Powell!

637
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.410
Hey, call the guard! Go!

638
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.580
FBI.

639
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.970
Move!

640
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.350
Whoa! Whoa!

641
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.980
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

642
00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.190
Speed approximately seventy miles per hour.

643
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.870
Get out of the way!

644
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.420
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

645
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:28.450
This guy's hittin' every fuckin'
thing in sight tryin' to block us!

646
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.450
I hope you're insured!

647
00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.290
Oh, well, why not?

648
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.480
You're goin' down!

649
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.800
Hello?

650
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.340
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

651
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.100
Information? San Francisco?

652
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.310
Uh, Jade Angelou. That's A-N-G...

653
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:22.350
Welcome aboard, y'all. How y'all doin' today?

654
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.400
Hang on!

655
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.910
Holy shit!

656
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.920
Whoa-oa!

657
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.550
Oh, no!

658
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.770
We're gonna crash! Save yourselves!

659
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.480
Oh, my baby!

660
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.280
Oh, no!

661
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:25.590
Oh, no.

662
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.430
Oh, God!

663
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:34.180
Oh, God!

664
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.620
Hey, man, you just fucked up your Ferrari.

665
00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.620
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

666
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:02.330
Neither is this!

667
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.840
Damn! This sucks! Where's that son of a bitch at?

668
00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:13.680
I'm gonna hunt him down! That
motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

669
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.906
Chem weapons. Isherwood.

670
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.954
Marvin, look up Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

671
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.020
The inmate is Mason, John.

672
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.060
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

673
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.020
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

674
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.000
Look, I just stole a kid's motorcycle.

675
00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:32.304
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

676
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.820
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

677
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:41.700
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

678
00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.580
This is weird. They got medical records.

679
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:50.920
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

680
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.250
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

681
00:49:53.274 --> 00:49:57.534
A Jade Angelou of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

682
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.570
Jade?

683
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:22.370
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

684
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:29.960
Were you afraid to come alone?

685
00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.880
Yeah.

686
00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.930
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

687
00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.680
The last photograph I had
of you, you were about ten.

688
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.140
Yeah?

689
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:48.230
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

690
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:54.690
Oh, yeah? Well, uh- Why don't we take a walk?

691
00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.660
I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

692
00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.740
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

693
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:04.330
Yeah, she was.

694
00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:06.751
But I don't think that we should romanticize

695
00:51:06.776 --> 00:51:08.564
what happened between you and her.

696
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:11.500
Meeting in a bar after a Led Zeppelin concert.

697
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:14.340
Head out, and I was the result.

698
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.340
Well, I'd like to think it would've
led somewhere if only...

699
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.600
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door

700
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.100
and dragged you back to prison?

701
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.060
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

702
00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:32.730
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

703
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.820
That's good.

704
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.450
What did you do?

705
00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.240
J...

706
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:49.830
Jade, I don't have a great deal of time here.

707
00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.670
But I'll be coming back. And, uh...

708
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:56.380
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

709
00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:02.430
You know, you're almost the only evidence

710
00:52:02.550 --> 00:52:04.970
that I exist.

711
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.930
But I don't know you.

712
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.100
That's what I want to change, eh?

713
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:18.150
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

714
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.110
Here we are, and I'm lost.

715
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.030
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

716
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.160
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

717
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.420
If you can believe that, then it's a start.

718
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.050
Okay.

719
00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:50.440
Is this about you?

720
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.660
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you? Why did you come to me?

721
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:11.540
FBI, ma'am. Your father's working with us.

722
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.620
He's helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

723
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:16.130
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

724
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.170
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess
we oughta get goin', huh?

725
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.760
Whatever you say, Stanley.

726
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.430
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

727
00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.730
What do you say we cut the chitchat, a-hole?

728
00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:37.820
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

729
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.240
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

730
00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.121
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

731
00:53:44.145 --> 00:53:47.280
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

732
00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:48.830
You wrecked half the city!

733
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.040
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

734
00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:01.420
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

735
00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:05.510
All right, there's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

736
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.010
Yes. That's exactly where I had come out.

737
00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.560
Then beneath the cistern, there's a
connection to the abandoned septic system.

738
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.350
How many feet is that?

739
00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.600
Uh, fifty-seven paces.

740
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.820
Where do we go from there?

741
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.900
Where do we go from there?

742
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.490
That's a good question.

743
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:32.290
- I have no idea.
- What?

744
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.670
I mean, I'll know it when we're all inside.

745
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.210
No. You're not goddam goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

746
00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.550
I can't! My blueprint was in my head.

747
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.970
I was underground for three days in the dark,

748
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.680
just waiting for the tides to be right.

749
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:53.220
But don't worry. It'll all come back to me.

750
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.890
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

751
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.680
Wait a second. Now, this piece of work might be

752
00:54:58.705 --> 00:55:01.254
the only chance those people over there have.

753
00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.940
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

754
00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:04.925
He's smart.

755
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.514
I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

756
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:11.740
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

757
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:13.580
He'll fuck with you.

758
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.460
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

759
00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.540
Now, Womack,

760
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:24.300
you're between the Rock and a hard case.

761
00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.840
How is your bowling arm?

762
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.510
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

763
00:55:33.534 --> 00:55:35.680
then neutralize the V.X. chemical rounds.

764
00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.847
Well, we know the poison's
being kept in the prison

765
00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:39.610
morgue from the satellite thermal imaging...

766
00:55:39.634 --> 00:55:42.190
which is right here; these colorized dots.

767
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.723
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

768
00:55:44.748 --> 00:55:46.514
No, sir, but I've studied them.

769
00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:50.030
I should really begin briefing your
guys on defusing and detoxification.

770
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.120
Got a really neat layout over here of
the chem round as well as the rocket,

771
00:55:53.144 --> 00:55:55.984
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

772
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.830
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

773
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.250
The power of this chemical is way
beyond anything you can imagine.

774
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.010
An ecological disaster, sir.

775
00:56:06.130 --> 00:56:08.550
Plus the devices themselves are complicated.

776
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.390
That's why you're coming with us.

777
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:18.140
- I am?
- You're the expert. What's your problem?

778
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.940
You mean I'm going, going
out there, under the water?

779
00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.270
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.

780
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.610
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

781
00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:30.360
Have you ever been in a combat situation?

782
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:32.990
- Define "combat", sir.
- Shep?

783
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.662
An incursion underwater to retake an

784
00:56:34.687 --> 00:56:36.604
impregnable fortress held by an elite team

785
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.830
of U.S. Marines in possession of eighty-one
hostages and fifteen guided rockets

786
00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.000
armed with V.X. poisoned gas.

787
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.880
Oh. In that case, no, sir. Excuse me.

788
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:55.260
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

789
00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.600
You don't look too good.

790
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.350
<i>In fact, you look like shit.</i>

791
00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:06.730
My stomach's doing hula hoops around my ass.

792
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.190
You all right?

793
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.410
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?

794
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.570
I don't know.

795
00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.080
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

796
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.000
but nothing prepares you for it.

797
00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.420
Now I'm- I'm responsible...

798
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.460
for a whole city.

799
00:57:27.550 --> 00:57:29.260
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

800
00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.620
Remember you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

801
00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:33.720
and believe me, it'll come back to you.

802
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.220
Besides, you got the best
SEAL team in the country backing you up.

803
00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:41.060
Okay. You're right.

804
00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.730
I-I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

805
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.650
There's something else.

806
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.280
It's terrible. N-No, it's wonderful,

807
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.820
except it isn't.

808
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:57.200
My girlfriend's pregnant...

809
00:57:57.330 --> 00:58:01.160
and she's just flown in to see me.

810
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.051
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight.

811
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.258
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend

812
00:58:06.283 --> 00:58:08.114
and bring her here to the command center.

813
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.560
- Hummel!
<i>- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.</i>

814
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.440
<i>I'm at the White House with General Kramer.</i>

815
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.440
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

816
00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:33.446
<i>Don't tell me problems, tell me solutions.</i>

817
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:35.054
Now, we've spoken to the president,

818
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.550
and I know that you're well aware
of his stance on terrorism.

819
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.398
So what we'd like to do is...

820
00:58:39.423 --> 00:58:42.854
This isn't about terrorism. This is about justice.

821
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:46.030
It's about reminding you people who
found it politically convenient to forget.

822
00:58:46.054 --> 00:58:47.960
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

823
00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.790
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

824
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:52.380
Fifteen V.X. gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

825
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.760
You've got seventeen hours to deliver the money.

826
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:57.590
Or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.

827
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.440
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

828
00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:08.600
no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.

829
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:11.470
That is the word.

830
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:17.950
Green light to SEAL incursion.

831
00:59:35.550 --> 00:59:39.050
Fall in! All right, listen up.

832
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.260
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

833
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.350
Lieutenant Shepard will be attached to his hip.

834
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:47.440
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps.

835
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.400
Understood?

836
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.900
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

837
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:56.780
When he neutralizes the threat, we launch
green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

838
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.910
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives

839
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:03.950
against maybe the greatest battalion
commander in the Vietnam War.

840
01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.250
I shit you not.

841
01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.250
Any questions?

842
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.000
Let's load up!

843
01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.600
After you, ace.

844
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.490
Pass out and activate the minicams.

845
01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.790
Everything set here? Minicams operational?

846
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.380
Roger that, sir. We are on-line.

847
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:05.140
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

848
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:10.390
Uh, let's see. We have, uh,

849
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:13.270
one quart of kerosene in a squeeze bottle.

850
01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:21.150
Three washers and waterproof matches.

851
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.570
Use the green flares to signal when
the threat has been neutralized.

852
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.040
Now, this is atropine. If you
come in contact with the gas,

853
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.330
you have twenty seconds to
inject it into your heart.

854
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:32.750
Don't fuck with me on this. It may save your life.

855
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.420
I have three incoming bogeys bearing 275.

856
01:01:39.550 --> 01:01:41.920
Range: 6,000 meters.

857
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:48.350
FBI Command Center?

858
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.818
Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

859
01:01:50.843 --> 01:01:51.625
Nope.

860
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.900
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiancé.

861
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:57.400
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

862
01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.530
Okay. Well, you just sit here and
act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

863
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.780
Hey, where are you g... Goddam it!

864
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.954
Decoy choppers commencing run to Alcatraz.

865
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.330
I just lost one, sir. I just lost one.

866
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.430
<i>We only got two flying in. I just lost one.</i>

867
01:02:17.455 --> 01:02:18.455
Shit!

868
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:31.640
In my day, we did it all with a
snorkel and a pair of flippers.

869
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:35.100
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my résumé?

870
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.230
I don't... I don't know anything about you.

871
01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.154
Hmm. I know something about you, Godspell.

872
01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:40.804
Goodspeed.

873
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.530
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell,

874
01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.370
you never went to any antiterrorist school.

875
01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:50.330
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

876
01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.460
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

877
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.340
Raider One has dropped below radar coverage,

878
01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.340
heading around Treasure Island.

879
01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:07.510
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

880
01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:14.310
Decoys?

881
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.350
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

882
01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.400
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

883
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.910
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

884
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:33.490
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

885
01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:37.330
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

886
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.880
All right, so the S.D.U.s have been
deployed, and the Eagles are in the water.

887
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:02.030
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

888
01:04:02.054 --> 01:04:04.030
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

889
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.110
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

890
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.240
Let's move. Move out! Move out! Move out!

891
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:08.670
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

892
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:17.180
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.

893
01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.600
You've led us into a room with no exit.

894
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:27.156
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon. We're sitting ducks.

895
01:05:27.157 --> 01:05:28.317
We're a little tight on time.

896
01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:31.980
You stand by the door until I open it.

897
01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.820
I'd like to know how you
plan on accomplishing that?

898
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:37.140
Through here.

899
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:47.840
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

900
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.840
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

901
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.880
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

902
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:53.813
Thank you.

903
01:05:53.838 --> 01:05:56.245
Commander, you said never to
leave his sight, but, uh...

904
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:58.350
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

905
01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:00.950
Have a nice day.

906
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:27.500
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

907
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.720
Clear here, sir.
<i>No motion sensors tripped.</i>

908
01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:42.004
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

909
01:06:42.452 --> 01:06:43.740
Sweep forward!

910
01:06:53.979 --> 01:06:55.530
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

911
01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.740
I knew it. That son of a bitch jumped ship.

912
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.120
Welcome to the Rock.

913
01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.730
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

914
01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:27.560
That's the subway.
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

915
01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:29.810
Do it!

916
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:49.790
Sir, the Eagles have breached the tunnel system.

917
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.720
You enjoying this?

918
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.890
Well, it's certainly more
enjoyable than my average day.

919
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:06.390
Reading philosophy, avoiding
gang rape in the washroom.

920
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:10.440
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

921
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.200
We've got seismic activity in
one of the storm grates. North side.

922
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.070
Continue patrolling the area.

923
01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.030
Sweep forward!

924
01:08:24.450 --> 01:08:26.973
Commander, halt. We've got movement.

925
01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.290
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
<i>- Stand fast.</i>

926
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.170
Down, down, down.

927
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.050
West storm drain's clear.

928
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:50.140
Ninety-seven paces to the shower room.

929
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.680
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room, sir.

930
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.580
Fiber optics.

931
01:09:10.290 --> 01:09:13.840
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

932
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.320
Quiet.

933
01:09:45.070 --> 01:09:46.760
Motion sensors.

934
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.275
- Beams cutting across the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

935
01:09:56.540 --> 01:10:00.470
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

936
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.152
Possibly a prism.

937
01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.890
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam,

938
01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:13.310
send the beam back to its source
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

939
01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.230
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

940
01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.490
We've got visitors. Let's move.

941
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.153
Got it. Good to go.

942
01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.358
Fuck, man! I knew this would happen! Fuck!

943
01:10:32.383 --> 01:10:33.435
Move!

944
01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.346
Stand fast. We'll secure the area.

945
01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.100
They're entering into the shower room, sir.

946
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.270
They're securing the area.

947
01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:05.472
Just sit tight.

948
01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.953
Drop your weapons!

949
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.654
Drop 'em!

950
01:11:12.655 --> 01:11:14.290
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

951
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:17.242
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

952
01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.466
It's a fucking trap.

953
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:25.217
This is General Hummel.

954
01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:28.423
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

955
01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.120
Anderson here, General Hummel.

956
01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:35.192
Commander. Team leader.

957
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:38.112
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men,

958
01:11:38.113 --> 01:11:40.913
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

959
01:11:40.937 --> 01:11:42.530
This is not happening.

960
01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:46.070
Sir, we know why you're out here.

961
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.490
God knows I agree with you.

962
01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:52.962
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies,

963
01:11:52.963 --> 01:11:56.280
foreign, sir, and domestic.

964
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.469
General, we've spilled the
same blood in the same mud.

965
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:04.119
You know goddam well I can't give that order.

966
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.210
We're dead.

967
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:08.800
Your unit is covered from an
elevated position, Commander.

968
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:12.680
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

969
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.180
No one has to die here.

970
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.690
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

971
01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:22.179
Have you forgotten that?

972
01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.030
We all have shipmates we remember.

973
01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:28.590
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

974
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.050
But that doesn't give you the right to mutiny!

975
01:12:31.075 --> 01:12:32.684
You call it what you want!

976
01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.880
You're down there, we're up here.

977
01:12:34.905 --> 01:12:36.825
You walked into the wrong goddam room, Commander!

978
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.870
- Stand fast!
- Goddam it, Commander, one last time.

979
01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.140
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

980
01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:43.710
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

981
01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.630
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

982
01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:49.510
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

983
01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:50.671
Let's waste these fuckers.

984
01:12:50.695 --> 01:12:53.219
One last time. You order your
men to safety their weapons...

985
01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.610
Cease fire!

986
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.365
Don't go.

987
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:28.130
Cease fire!

988
01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.930
Cease fire!

989
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.190
Shit! Goddam it!

990
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:43.650
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

991
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:45.860
Don't. Don't go.

992
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:36.910
It's over.

993
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.533
Oh, God!

994
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:09.180
Mason.

995
01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.525
We got some movement.

996
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.814
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

997
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:24.580
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

998
01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:27.420
- I-It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

999
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:30.780
I've gotta get a team together right now.
We've gotta move with the second option.

1000
01:15:30.804 --> 01:15:32.590
What, and invite another massacre? No way.

1001
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:37.075
We've got a sixty year old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

1002
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:39.640
Not for Mason, it isn't.

1003
01:15:51.570 --> 01:15:55.106
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

1004
01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:01.229
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

1005
01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:03.290
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

1006
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:06.788
<i>Goodspeed. Goodspeed, do you read me?</i>

1007
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:08.348
It's for you.

1008
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.630
- Sir?
<i>- What's the status?</i>

1009
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:15.510
The status is they're dead. They're dead!

1010
01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:17.630
It's just me and Mason. Now he says he's leaving.

1011
01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.678
<i>That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!</i>

1012
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.770
Well, there's a problem, sir. He's got a gun.

1013
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.450
What do you have, a fuckin' water pistol?

1014
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.810
- No, sir.
<i>- Go after him and stop him.</i>

1015
01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.772
I didn't want this.

1016
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:37.820
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

1017
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:41.030
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

1018
01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.660
Then maybe we need to execute a few hostages.

1019
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:46.724
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

1020
01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:50.670
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

1021
01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:11.020
Sir?

1022
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.940
<i>You made a terrible mistake.</i>

1023
01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:19.761
<i>And more of our brothers have died in vain.</i>

1024
01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:23.238
<i>Damn you for forcing me into this position.</i>

1025
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:29.540
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

1026
01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.080
Now you told me I'm on a need-to-know basis.

1027
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.923
And I'm tellin' you right now, I need to know

1028
01:17:34.948 --> 01:17:37.162
who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.

1029
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:41.780
All right, you wanna know? 1962, J. Edgar Hoover

1030
01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.650
is head of the FBI, some say the country.

1031
01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.660
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

1032
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.330
De Gaulle, British members of Parliament,
even the Prime Minister.

1033
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:55.440
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

1034
01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:59.741
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

1035
01:17:59.742 --> 01:18:01.990
Mason was the British
operative who stole the files.

1036
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.870
But our Bureau agents caught
him at the Canadian border.

1037
01:18:05.190 --> 01:18:08.290
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

1038
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.330
And we held him without trial

1039
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.407
until he gave up the microfilm, but he never did.

1040
01:18:15.408 --> 01:18:17.888
Well, I'm surprised Hoover didn't
use his daughter as leverage.

1041
01:18:17.912 --> 01:18:21.010
Hoover was dead in '72. She wasn't born yet.

1042
01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:24.720
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

1043
01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:29.661
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

1044
01:18:29.662 --> 01:18:33.958
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

1045
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:37.940
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

1046
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:42.208
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

1047
01:18:43.530 --> 01:18:47.490
And he is the only hope that we have got.

1048
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:50.540
Mason! Mason!

1049
01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:55.120
There are eighty-one hostages still up there.

1050
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:57.000
Yeah, like me.

1051
01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:59.750
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

1052
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:02.630
Okay. FBI! Freeze, sucker!

1053
01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.930
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

1054
01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:12.640
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

1055
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.520
Let's find out.

1056
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.860
I could; you, no.

1057
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:24.400
Besides, your safety's on.

1058
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:28.120
<i>Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?</i>

1059
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:33.160
Not yet.

1060
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:36.670
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

1061
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:39.290
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

1062
01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:42.130
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1063
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:46.550
What it says is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1064
01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:50.560
That's right. I got a lunatic up there, man,

1065
01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.230
with fifteen missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

1066
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:59.150
That lying Womack. You could've told my daughter.

1067
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:03.740
It was classified. Look, I'm in the same situation.

1068
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.030
They've got my girlfriend in the
city with a baby on the way.

1069
01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:11.240
Look, I can defuse the rockets. I really can.

1070
01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:13.810
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1071
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.550
Sir, this man's weapons and TAC radio are missing!

1072
01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:28.340
Shit, we got a rodent problem. Flush the pipes.

1073
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.739
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddam island.

1074
01:20:30.764 --> 01:20:32.045
Check every access you can find.

1075
01:20:32.054 --> 01:20:33.094
Sir.

1076
01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:41.900
Even if you escape from the island,

1077
01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.246
you can't escape the rockets.

1078
01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.950
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1079
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:56.080
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

1080
01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:02.170
What about your daughter? Mason?

1081
01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:06.920
Rodents located.

1082
01:21:07.050 --> 01:21:10.647
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1083
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.957
I don't think you do.

1084
01:21:24.730 --> 01:21:26.860
Move!

1085
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:53.010
They're onto us.

1086
01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:54.472
Burn 'em out.

1087
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:59.858
This mother's gonna blow big.

1088
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.980
I don't understand. How could we
lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1089
01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.610
We've lost coms. Still got 'em on locaters.

1090
01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:59.410
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1091
01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.487
How do you like your choices?

1092
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:05.269
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

1093
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.213
All right, come on.

1094
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.086
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1095
01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:15.590
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?

1096
01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:18.740
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1097
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.060
maybe when this is all over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1098
01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:26.350
But right now I just, I just
I wanna find some rockets.

1099
01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:32.530
Don't tempt me. We are going to the morgue.

1100
01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:59.327
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1101
01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.810
Your best?

1102
01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:05.323
Losers always whine about their best.

1103
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:08.770
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

1104
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:12.150
Carla was the prom queen.

1105
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.650
- Really?
- Yeah.

1106
01:24:17.570 --> 01:24:20.450
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.

1107
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.040
Come on, come on. You can do it, Doc.

1108
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.420
You must never hesitate.

1109
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.660
I think you're shooting too close to the rocket.

1110
01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.660
Him, but not the rocket.

1111
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.990
Any other news, Professor?

1112
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.500
Not the rocket! Not the rocket.

1113
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:26.310
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1114
01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:54.270
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1115
01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:57.336
Mason,

1116
01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:02.140
the second you don't respect this, it kills you.

1117
01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.953
Put it over there.

1118
01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.874
You've been around a lot of corpses. Is that normal?

1119
01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:21.360
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1120
01:26:21.490 --> 01:26:22.230
Yeah, it happens.

1121
01:26:22.255 --> 01:26:25.126
Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

1122
01:26:25.127 --> 01:26:28.450
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

1123
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:31.460
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1124
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:35.630
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1125
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:39.920
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here

1126
01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:42.680
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1127
01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.430
So what do you say you cut me some friggin' slack?

1128
01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:03.780
A really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

1129
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:06.620
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1130
01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.790
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1131
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:11.950
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it
can take out the entire city of people.

1132
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:17.960
Really? And what happens if you drop one?

1133
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:21.460
<i>Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.</i>

1134
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:23.970
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1135
01:27:24.090 --> 01:27:27.370
Stops the brain from sending nerve messages
down the spinal cord within thirty seconds.

1136
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:30.470
Any epidermal exposure or
inhalation, and you'll know.

1137
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.100
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1138
01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:37.020
Do not move that!

1139
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:42.690
Your muscles freeze, you can't breathe.

1140
01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:46.030
You spasm so hard you break your
own back, spit your guts out.

1141
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.910
But that's after your skin melts off.

1142
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.409
My God.

1143
01:27:51.490 --> 01:27:54.620
Oh, I think we'd like God on our
side at the moment, don't you?

1144
01:27:56.830 --> 01:28:00.170
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1145
01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:02.260
so the rocket will splash down
after five hundred feet.

1146
01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.470
All right, let me have that.

1147
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:08.640
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1148
01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.812
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1149
01:28:14.730 --> 01:28:17.075
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Over.

1150
01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.520
<i>Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddam it!</i>

1151
01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:27.320
Somebody's still there. Let's move!

1152
01:28:27.450 --> 01:28:29.700
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1153
01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.700
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1154
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:35.120
Frye, Darrow, hustle up. We got more company!

1155
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:40.131
Hold it.

1156
01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:43.116
Converge on the morgue. Move out.

1157
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.300
Goodspeed, come on. Come over here.

1158
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:50.337
Good. I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.

1159
01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.470
Come on. Time's up.

1160
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.139
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them.

1161
01:28:58.190 --> 01:28:59.190
Come on!

1162
01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:20.305
Clear!

1163
01:29:22.670 --> 01:29:24.500
I'm too old for this.

1164
01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:27.912
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1165
01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:31.494
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1166
01:29:31.890 --> 01:29:34.370
Captain, I guess you didn't quite
take care of the rat problem.

1167
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:36.500
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here

1168
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.923
who strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1169
01:29:38.948 --> 01:29:39.715
Yes, sir.

1170
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:42.910
Yes, sir! Rio, Royce, let's go!

1171
01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.940
Move out!

1172
01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:53.160
- You really don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1173
01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:56.041
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1174
01:29:56.065 --> 01:29:58.065
No, I don't.

1175
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:27.940
God.

1176
01:30:36.120 --> 01:30:38.830
Mason, you all right?

1177
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:41.660
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot!

1178
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:46.540
- They're coming.
- Who?

1179
01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:49.510
- The Marines!
- Where?

1180
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:54.199
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1181
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:03.830
No! No! No!

1182
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:20.430
Mason!

1183
01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:25.390
Mason!

1184
01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:46.180
You motherfucker! Die! Die! Die!

1185
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:09.478
I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long.

1186
01:34:13.670 --> 01:34:16.840
How do you do it?

1187
01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:22.760
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1188
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:26.215
Come on.

1189
01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:30.948
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1190
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:32.463
Okay.

1191
01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:40.400
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.

1192
01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:45.410
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1193
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:48.790
- What's the word from Mojave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1194
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:51.620
They're going as fast as they can.

1195
01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:00.470
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1196
01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.730
<i>Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got
something that belongs to me.</i>

1197
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:16.270
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1198
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:21.030
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1199
01:35:21.150 --> 01:35:23.110
Speak up.

1200
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:27.200
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh...

1201
01:35:27.330 --> 01:35:30.120
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1202
01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.330
- Oh, man.
<i>- And I'm a father of three.</i>

1203
01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:37.750
And, uh, they've got a gun to my head.

1204
01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.630
You've got exactly three minutes to return
the guidance chips to the exercise yard...

1205
01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.470
<i>- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.</i>
- Oh, no.

1206
01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.260
Hey. Wha...

1207
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:50.640
Now, three to go.

1208
01:35:50.770 --> 01:35:53.810
You find them and defuse them, okay?

1209
01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.600
- All right.
- All right.

1210
01:35:56.730 --> 01:36:00.320
I'll try and delay Hummel and give you more time.

1211
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.610
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1212
01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.160
Okay? What do you mean?

1213
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:16.329
Okay.

1214
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:32.749
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1215
01:36:34.230 --> 01:36:36.520
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1216
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:52.200
Bingo.

1217
01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.497
Steady.

1218
01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:10.050
Thought I'd been in the service a long time.

1219
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:14.430
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's Army, actually.

1220
01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.665
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir."

1221
01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:23.110
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir,

1222
01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:27.110
of Her Majesty's S.A.S. Retired, of course.

1223
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:33.851
You're a long way from home, Captain.

1224
01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.330
How the hell are you involved in this?

1225
01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.870
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1226
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.340
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1227
01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.381
Hi, sweetie.

1228
01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:08.020
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1229
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:12.370
Did they bother to tell you who
I am, why I'm doing this?

1230
01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:14.950
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1231
01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:19.010
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1232
01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.799
Then you wouldn't have any fuckin' idea what

1233
01:38:20.824 --> 01:38:22.504
it means to lead some of the finest men

1234
01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.441
on God's earth into battle, and then see their

1235
01:38:24.466 --> 01:38:26.360
memory betrayed by their own fuckin' government.

1236
01:38:26.384 --> 01:38:28.920
I don't quite see how you
cherish the memory of the dead

1237
01:38:29.050 --> 01:38:31.760
by killing another million.

1238
01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.970
And, uh, this is not combat.

1239
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.350
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1240
01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:42.374
Personally, I think you're a fuckin' idiot.

1241
01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.680
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time"

1242
01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:54.280
"with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
Thomas Jefferson.

1243
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:59.330
"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious",
according to Oscar Wilde.

1244
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:08.477
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1245
01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:11.301
Where are the guidance chips?

1246
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:15.507
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1247
01:39:16.180 --> 01:39:18.180
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1248
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:49.792
You're lucky that old man Hummel wants you alive.

1249
01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:51.880
'Cause I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1250
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.600
<i>"I'd take pleasure in guttin' you,"</i>

1251
01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.270
<i>"boy."</i>

1252
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:07.810
"I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy."

1253
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.730
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?

1254
01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:16.279
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh, a
lot of anger floatin' around this island?

1255
01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:19.550
Kind of a pubescent volatility? Don't you think?

1256
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:22.910
A lot of angst, a lot of, "I'm sixteen,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1257
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.290
I mean, grow up! We're stuck on an island...

1258
01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:29.369
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure
seeking psychopathic Marines.

1259
01:40:29.370 --> 01:40:31.380
Shame on them!

1260
01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:37.390
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

1261
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:40.439
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1262
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:44.020
I was just thinking how wonderful it was

1263
01:40:44.140 --> 01:40:46.480
when the inmates weren't allowed to talk in here.

1264
01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.786
Not allowed to talk.

1265
01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.059
How'd you do it?

1266
01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:56.822
Uh, nurtured the hope that there was hope.

1267
01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.950
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1268
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:03.410
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1269
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:08.370
Modest hopes, but, uh, they kept a man alive.

1270
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.015
What'd they put you away for, John?

1271
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:14.098
Oh, that's a long story.

1272
01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:16.786
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1273
01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.890
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1274
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:22.640
Seven hours.

1275
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:27.480
Thermite plasma is operational.

1276
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.116
Get me the president.

1277
01:41:30.593 --> 01:41:31.371
Be seated.

1278
01:41:31.372 --> 01:41:35.030
Gentlemen, consider yourselves on ground
alert. If we receive launch authority,

1279
01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:38.820
your mission is the complete thermal
destruction of Alcatraz Island.

1280
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:42.919
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1281
01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.290
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines

1282
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:47.710
will lose their lives in this air strike.

1283
01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:52.170
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was

1284
01:41:52.290 --> 01:41:55.130
and, and create a solution?

1285
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:59.840
The moment they had the microfilm,
they'd suicide me.

1286
01:41:59.970 --> 01:42:03.930
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1287
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:08.270
Which brings me to another question.
When you broke out...

1288
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:12.900
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute,

1289
01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:17.400
on the mine cars, through the
tunnels to the power plant,

1290
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:21.360
under the steam engine, that
was really cool, by the way.

1291
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:24.030
And into the cistern through the intake pipe.

1292
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:29.620
But how, in the name of Zeus's butthole,

1293
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:31.918
did you get out of your cell?

1294
01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:35.380
I only ask because in our current situation,

1295
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:40.547
well, it could prove to be
useful information, maybe!

1296
01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:01.084
Trade secrets, my son.

1297
01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:04.450
Wow.

1298
01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.080
General, two operational rockets left.

1299
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.520
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1300
01:43:09.544 --> 01:43:12.040
And both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.

1301
01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:15.420
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

1302
01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:18.090
Oh, just makin' sure.

1303
01:43:18.210 --> 01:43:22.253
Should we prepare for launch, General?

1304
01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:24.930
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

1305
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:28.600
Yes, sir.

1306
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:32.600
The hour is approaching, sir. Just letting
the general know of the time, sir.

1307
01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:36.560
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1308
01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:39.320
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1309
01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.700
Mason, where're you going?

1310
01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.320
Thirty years ago I vowed I
wouldn't die in this toilet.

1311
01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:51.551
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

1312
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:55.120
Shh. Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1313
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:59.340
Stop moving, Mason.

1314
01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:01.960
Mason, stop moving.

1315
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:05.720
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1316
01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.350
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1317
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:11.770
Oh, well, then, everything's just fine!

1318
01:44:11.890 --> 01:44:14.490
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1319
01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:18.940
Three minutes to go, sir.

1320
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:22.280
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1321
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.410
They'll call if we fire one of
our rockets up their ass.

1322
01:44:25.530 --> 01:44:28.530
Sir.

1323
01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.120
- Hummel.
<i>- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.</i>

1324
01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:38.880
<i>- How's it going out there?</i>
- How do you think it's goin'?

1325
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.240
<i>Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.</i>

1326
01:44:41.253 --> 01:44:42.464
You've got three minutes.

1327
01:44:42.570 --> 01:44:45.480
<i>Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get
final authorization from the president.</i>

1328
01:44:45.610 --> 01:44:47.390
You've got three minutes.

1329
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:49.760
<i>Frank, please don't do anything stupid.</i>

1330
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:54.350
They want another hour.

1331
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.770
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1332
01:44:57.900 --> 01:44:59.940
They're calling our bluff, sir.

1333
01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:03.900
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1334
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:07.240
Order the launch, General.

1335
01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.910
Come on, General. Let's be all we can be.

1336
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:27.380
The mission's not complete!

1337
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:28.804
Well, mine is.

1338
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:32.260
When this is over, you'll go back home,

1339
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:37.390
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1340
01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.110
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

1341
01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:42.560
You're not leaving.

1342
01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:51.825
All right, I'll do it myself.

1343
01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:55.450
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1344
01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:59.460
I'll kick the...
Out of a platoon full of Marines.

1345
01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:02.340
No problem.

1346
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:17.048
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1347
01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:20.650
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1348
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.510
Let's go!

1349
01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.490
Laser powered up!

1350
01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:35.102
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1351
01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.790
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1352
01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.830
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1353
01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:46.208
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1354
01:46:46.209 --> 01:46:48.529
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets,

1355
01:46:48.553 --> 01:46:50.718
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1356
01:46:50.719 --> 01:46:54.600
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1357
01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:58.020
So, what do you say you do
the math, h-hand over the gun

1358
01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:01.520
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck...

1359
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.030
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child

1360
01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.950
growing up without a father.

1361
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:18.910
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1362
01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.040
So, I'm fucked either way. So, come on.

1363
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:25.040
Weapon is hot. I am standing
by for the launch command.

1364
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:27.880
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing...

1365
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.380
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1366
01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:36.600
Access code entered. Weapon available for release.

1367
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.640
Launch coordinates: six, seven,

1368
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:43.437
five, four, five, niner.

1369
01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.956
The weapon is hot.
I'm standing by for launch command.

1370
01:47:49.957 --> 01:47:50.957
That's affirmative.

1371
01:47:58.330 --> 01:48:00.750
Standing by for command.

1372
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:11.300
I'm waiting for launch command, General.

1373
01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:22.310
- Fire.
- Fire!

1374
01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.610
Missile loose! Missile loose!

1375
01:48:35.150 --> 01:48:39.700
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1376
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:44.147
- What's the goddam heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1377
01:48:44.148 --> 01:48:45.023
Speed?

1378
01:48:45.048 --> 01:48:47.034
Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

1379
01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:49.613
Football game.

1380
01:48:53.130 --> 01:48:54.920
Oh, my God.

1381
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:20.251
Missile radically changing direction.

1382
01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.460
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1383
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.170
Oh, Christ!

1384
01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:37.421
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1385
01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.680
Falling, 300 feet. 200. 100.

1386
01:49:44.970 --> 01:49:47.810
Bogey detonated under water.

1387
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:52.310
What the fuck?

1388
01:49:53.719 --> 01:49:54.730
It missed.

1389
01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:56.990
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1390
01:49:57.110 --> 01:49:58.737
But there's still one left.

1391
01:49:59.490 --> 01:50:03.120
What happened to the rocket? What
the fuck happened to the coordinates?

1392
01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.750
What the fuck is going on? Sir! Major!

1393
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:09.830
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1394
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.880
Captain, step outside!

1395
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:27.600
Get me the Pentagon.

1396
01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:44.580
What the hell was that, Frank?

1397
01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:45.615
I said, what the hell...

1398
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:47.980
I heard what you said!
If you're gonna be insubordinate,

1399
01:50:48.004 --> 01:50:50.400
I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.

1400
01:50:50.425 --> 01:50:51.484
Cut the crap, General.

1401
01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.460
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1402
01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.590
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1403
01:50:55.710 --> 01:50:58.760
Do it, Frank! We're coming loose.

1404
01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:01.970
You're coming loose. The rest
of us are in complete control.

1405
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:04.234
We're askin' 'em. We're askin'
'em for a new deadline.

1406
01:51:04.259 --> 01:51:05.259
Put the phone down.

1407
01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:07.300
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are Marines!

1408
01:51:07.324 --> 01:51:08.353
Are they?

1409
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:13.440
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

1410
01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:14.577
Put him on the phone right now.

1411
01:51:14.602 --> 01:51:16.094
You've been ordered by a superior officer.

1412
01:51:16.190 --> 01:51:17.040
This is Major Baxter.

1413
01:51:17.065 --> 01:51:19.590
Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1414
01:51:19.614 --> 01:51:22.024
Put the phone down.

1415
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:28.200
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1416
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:31.620
At ease.

1417
01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:42.800
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1418
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:54.400
These past few hours...

1419
01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:58.320
<i>have been the longest, darkest of my life.</i>

1420
01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:02.530
<i>How does one weigh human life?</i>

1421
01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:06.070
<i>One million civilians
against eighty-one hostages.</i>

1422
01:52:07.450 --> 01:52:09.490
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1423
01:52:11.290 --> 01:52:15.830
That we have ignored, abandoned or marginalized

1424
01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.340
<i>a great soldier like Frank Hummel,</i>

1425
01:52:18.460 --> 01:52:23.340
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

1426
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:27.680
<i>is equally real and equally tragic.</i>

1427
01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.640
We are at war with terror.

1428
01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:36.020
<i>Fighting a war means casualties.</i>

1429
01:52:36.150 --> 01:52:39.520
<i>This is the worst call I've ever had to make.</i>

1430
01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:45.919
Air strike approved.

1431
01:52:49.450 --> 01:52:51.902
<i>Red Thunder to tower. Request clearance.</i>

1432
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.460
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1433
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.340
<i>Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go.</i>

1434
01:52:57.364 --> 01:52:58.740
...it'll be over in a few seconds.

1435
01:52:58.764 --> 01:53:00.974
<i>Flight time to drop point. 17 minutes.</i>

1436
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:10.126
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect

1437
01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:12.334
to you, but what the fuck is going on?

1438
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:14.382
You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?

1439
01:53:14.407 --> 01:53:15.694
That's affirmative, Captain.

1440
01:53:15.730 --> 01:53:19.790
So, now they think we're gutless, the Feds?
They think we won't actually do it.

1441
01:53:19.810 --> 01:53:22.690
They're gonna come at us with everything
they've got. Air and sea.

1442
01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:25.065
They're gonna bomb our ass back to the Stone Age.

1443
01:53:25.090 --> 01:53:26.974
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1444
01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:32.740
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

1445
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:36.710
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1446
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:39.390
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1447
01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:41.380
The consequences of our actions I'll face alone.

1448
01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:45.060
Excuse me, General,
but what about the fucking money?

1449
01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:47.550
There is no fucking money. Mission's over.

1450
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:49.390
Bullshit it's over.

1451
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:53.060
You're talking to a general,
soldier. Maintain discipline.

1452
01:53:53.180 --> 01:53:55.220
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1453
01:53:55.350 --> 01:54:00.020
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

1454
01:54:00.150 --> 01:54:02.730
I want my fucking money!

1455
01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:06.570
This mission was based on the threat of force.

1456
01:54:06.690 --> 01:54:08.810
I'm not about to kill
eighty thousand innocent people.

1457
01:54:08.835 --> 01:54:10.724
Do you think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1458
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.750
We bluffed. They called it. The mission's over.

1459
01:54:20.250 --> 01:54:22.790
Whoever said anything about bluffing, General?

1460
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.800
Stand down, Captain.

1461
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:31.720
Stand down, Captain!

1462
01:54:37.730 --> 01:54:40.600
Major, I'm ordering you to take these
men to the choppers and evacuate.

1463
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:47.690
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1464
01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:50.240
Sergeant Crisp,

1465
01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:53.120
secure the General.

1466
01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.580
I'm relieving you of your command, sir.

1467
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:01.489
Sergeant!

1468
01:55:09.130 --> 01:55:12.470
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1469
01:55:20.730 --> 01:55:24.150
Major Baxter, you're either with us or against us.

1470
01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:32.910
It has been the greatest honor of
my life to serve with you, General.

1471
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:40.750
But like he said,

1472
01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.710
it's over.

1473
01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:02.810
Let's get him.

1474
01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:10.530
Mason!

1475
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.425
My God, what have I done?

1476
01:56:14.450 --> 01:56:17.144
Where's the last rocket? Where's the last rocket?

1477
01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.120
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1478
01:56:23.250 --> 01:56:25.960
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1479
01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:42.060
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1480
01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:52.570
One, two, three! Eat that!

1481
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.420
Did it.

1482
01:57:39.530 --> 01:57:43.950
Come here. Come here, you little chicken shit!

1483
01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:47.330
You shoot me, I drop this. We're both dead.

1484
01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.700
Well, come on. Come on. Don't
be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1485
01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:51.960
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1486
01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:54.210
You know how this shit works?

1487
01:57:58.260 --> 01:58:00.300
Come on. Come on.

1488
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:02.470
I don't need the gun. I'll put it down.

1489
01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.930
Come on, let's play. Come on. Come on.

1490
01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:11.690
Listen, I think we got started off on the
wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI. Uh...

1491
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:14.980
Let's talk music. Do you like the
Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1492
01:58:15.110 --> 01:58:17.150
I don't like soft-ass shit.

1493
01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:19.410
Oh, you... Oh, oh. Oh.

1494
01:58:19.530 --> 01:58:23.490
Well, I only bring it up because, uh, it's you.

1495
01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.120
You're the Rocket Man.

1496
01:58:27.790 --> 01:58:29.540
No!

1497
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:35.840
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1498
01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:45.720
It splashed into the bay, sir. No detonation.

1499
01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:49.480
Shit!

1500
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.620
Darrow!

1501
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:13.750
Open up!

1502
01:59:16.590 --> 01:59:18.210
Come on.

1503
01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.050
Open up!

1504
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:51.580
Hey, you mother!

1505
02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:27.700
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1506
02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:32.667
Okay.

1507
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:37.965
I got ya. I got you, baby.

1508
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:40.132
Come on.

1509
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:58.690
Fucker!

1510
02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.390
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1511
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:29.850
Time on target: seven minutes.

1512
02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:50.070
English prick. I tell you my old man was Irish?

1513
02:01:52.990 --> 02:01:55.710
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1514
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.090
Fuck!

1515
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.530
It's me and you, pal.

1516
02:02:24.650 --> 02:02:27.070
I want that fucking chip!

1517
02:02:37.330 --> 02:02:39.370
I love pressure.

1518
02:02:46.630 --> 02:02:49.590
I know you're in here, and I know you can hear me.

1519
02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:52.100
Now, pay the piper and come out like a man.

1520
02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:24.468
Increase speed to 500 knots.

1521
02:03:24.469 --> 02:03:26.880
You motherfucker! Die!

1522
02:03:31.630 --> 02:03:35.600
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1523
02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:38.560
Eat that, you fuck!

1524
02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.420
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: sixty seconds.

1525
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:18.470
Come to course heading 142 degrees.

1526
02:04:26.190 --> 02:04:28.320
<i>When he neutralizes the threat,</i>

1527
02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:31.530
<i>we launch green flares and
we wait for the cavalry.</i>

1528
02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.950
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on their souls.

1529
02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:43.210
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

1530
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:56.930
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1531
02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.440
Target acquired. Rolling in.

1532
02:05:12.860 --> 02:05:16.780
This is Red Thunder. Master armed. Master armed.

1533
02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.620
Time on target: twelve seconds.

1534
02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:26.250
<i>T.O.T.: ten seconds.</i>

1535
02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:32.260
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1536
02:05:34.880 --> 02:05:37.010
I got green smoke. I got green smoke!

1537
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:40.430
<i>This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One! Green smoke!
We have green smoke! Over.</i>

1538
02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.720
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1539
02:05:42.850 --> 02:05:45.560
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
<i>- Jesus Chri...</i>

1540
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:49.579
I already dropped them!

1541
02:05:59.490 --> 02:06:03.450
- Oh, goddam it!
- Oh, my God!

1542
02:06:06.210 --> 02:06:08.831
Get out of my way.
Let me through, please. Let me through!

1543
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:18.017
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

1544
02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:44.771
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1545
02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:49.620
I suppose all this will make a great
bedtime story to tell your kid.

1546
02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:55.050
You're insane, Mason. The kid'll have
nightmares. Spend all my money on shrinks.

1547
02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:58.220
Goodspeed, come in.

1548
02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:01.510
Goodspeed, Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1549
02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:05.100
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1550
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:10.060
<i>Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!</i>

1551
02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:18.990
<i>Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!</i>

1552
02:07:19.110 --> 02:07:20.708
This is Goodspeed.

1553
02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:27.830
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

1554
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:33.420
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1555
02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:36.250
<i>What about Mason?</i>

1556
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:45.760
- He's dead, sir.
<i>- How? When?</i>

1557
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:47.743
Just come and get me.

1558
02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:53.712
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1559
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:56.824
But, of course. I knew he would.

1560
02:07:57.150 --> 02:08:00.240
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear should
still be where we came ashore.

1561
02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.924
If you can get to the Pan Pacific Hotel, there's

1562
02:08:02.949 --> 02:08:05.731
clothes in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

1563
02:08:05.732 --> 02:08:07.133
Room 26.

1564
02:08:07.870 --> 02:08:12.250
Well, it's been a long time since
I've said thank you to anybody.

1565
02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:15.657
But thank you.

1566
02:08:17.550 --> 02:08:22.048
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

1567
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:28.010
But, uh, I'm sure you know the
etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

1568
02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:32.270
Yeah, Godspeed: to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1569
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:36.110
Well, if you fancy a journey,

1570
02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:39.976
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1571
02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:41.812
I was thinking of Maui.

1572
02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:43.668
No.

1573
02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.166
Forget Maui.

1574
02:08:56.630 --> 02:09:00.572
"St Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas."

1575
02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:03.170
"Front pew, right leg."

1576
02:09:04.436 --> 02:09:05.640
"Hollow."

1577
02:09:06.260 --> 02:09:08.055
Is this what I think it is?

1578
02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:12.091
Mason?

1579
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:29.114
Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed. You did it.

1580
02:09:29.587 --> 02:09:30.575
Thank you, sir.

1581
02:09:30.576 --> 02:09:33.216
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1582
02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:34.626
Well done, son.

1583
02:09:36.094 --> 02:09:37.250
So, where's Mason?

1584
02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:41.442
Vaporized. Blown out to sea.

1585
02:09:41.790 --> 02:09:43.273
Blown out to sea, huh?

1586
02:09:44.525 --> 02:09:45.525
Yeah.

1587
02:09:47.300 --> 02:09:48.773
Poor bastard.

1588
02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:56.170
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1589
02:09:56.770 --> 02:10:00.266
Vaporized, sir. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1590
02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:05.070
What? Vaporized? A body can vaporize?

1591
02:10:05.190 --> 02:10:08.320
Oh, yeah! Absolutely, sir.

1592
02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.250
St. Michael's Church, front pew, right leg.

1593
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:17.039
Front pew, right leg.

1594
02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:19.380
<i>Vandals! Vandals!</i>

1595
02:10:20.384 --> 02:10:21.710
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1596
02:10:22.497 --> 02:10:25.630
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1597
02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:28.590
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1598
02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:31.970
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1599
02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:35.310
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1600
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:40.230
Vandals! Vandals!

1601
02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:45.360
Honey, uh, you wanna know who really killed J.F.K.?
