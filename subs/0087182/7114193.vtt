WEBVTT

1
00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:52.488
A beginning is
a very delicate time.

2
00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:57.919
Know then, that
it is the year 10191.

3
00:00:58.456 --> 00:00:59.914
The Known Universe is

4
00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:03.822
ruled by the
Padisha Emperor Shaddam lV,

5
00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.801
my father.

6
00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:10.080
In this time, the most precious
substance in the Universe

7
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:12.582
is the spice melange.

8
00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:15.956
The spice extends life.

9
00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:21.144
The spice expands
consciousness.

10
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:25.622
The spice is vital
to space travel.

11
00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:28.164
The Spacing Guild
and its navigators,

12
00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:32.622
who the spice has
mutated over 4,000 years,

13
00:01:32.623 --> 00:01:35.497
use the orange spice gas,

14
00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:39.560
which gives them
the ability to fold space.

15
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.122
That is,

16
00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:45.918
travel to any part of
the Universe without moving.

17
00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:50.529
Oh, yes.
l forgot to tell you.

18
00:01:50.623 --> 00:01:52.622
The spice exists

19
00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:56.914
on only one planet
in the entire Universe.

20
00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:01.706
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

21
00:02:01.998 --> 00:02:04.747
Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts

22
00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:07.873
are a people
known as the Fremen,

23
00:02:08.123 --> 00:02:11.080
who have long held a prophecy,

24
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.289
that a man would come,

25
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.085
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

26
00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:23.466
The planet is Arrakis.

27
00:02:23.498 --> 00:02:27.457
Also known as Dune.

28
00:03:53.706 --> 00:03:56.987
A secret report
within the Guild.

29
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.414
Four planets have
come to our attention

30
00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:04.894
regarding a plot which could
jeopardize spice production.

31
00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.925
Planet Arrakis,
source of the Spice.

32
00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:13.113
Planet Caladan,
home of House Atreides.

33
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.821
Planet Giedi Prime,
home of House Harkonnen.

34
00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:19.705
Planet Kaitain,

35
00:04:19.706 --> 00:04:23.248
home of the Emperor of
the Known Universe.

36
00:04:24.248 --> 00:04:27.580
Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain

37
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.205
to demand details
from the Emperor.

38
00:04:31.206 --> 00:04:33.967
The spice must flow.

39
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:21.122
Father?

40
00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:23.520
Lrulan, you must leave.

41
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:48.705
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

42
00:05:48.706 --> 00:05:51.312
We felt his presence.

43
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:53.455
I shall want telepathy
during his visit

44
00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:55.539
and a report
when we're finished.

45
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.029
I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

46
00:05:59.498 --> 00:06:01.270
He's here, my lord.

47
00:06:29.248 --> 00:06:32.633
The Bene
Gesserit witch must leave.

48
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.903
Leave us.

49
00:06:36.415 --> 00:06:38.291
Yes, my lord.

50
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:51.457
We are alone.

51
00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:39.622
We have just
folded space from Ix.

52
00:07:39.623 --> 00:07:41.030
Yes?

53
00:07:42.415 --> 00:07:44.289
How was your journey?

54
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.207
Many machines on Ix.

55
00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:50.080
New machines.

56
00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:51.436
Oh?

57
00:07:51.956 --> 00:07:53.259
Yes.

58
00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:56.654
Better than those on Richese.

59
00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:00.705
You are transparent.

60
00:08:00.706 --> 00:08:04.539
I see many things.

61
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.872
I see plans within plans.

62
00:08:08.873 --> 00:08:12.414
I see two great houses,

63
00:08:12.415 --> 00:08:17.210
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen feuding.

64
00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:21.080
I see you behind it.

65
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:22.247
Yes.

66
00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:26.207
You must share with us.

67
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.664
The Atreides House is
building a secret army

68
00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.580
using a technique
unknown to us.

69
00:08:31.581 --> 00:08:34.549
A technique involving sound.

70
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.414
The Duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

71
00:08:37.415 --> 00:08:39.580
He could threaten me.

72
00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:41.164
I have ordered House Atreides

73
00:08:41.165 --> 00:08:43.580
to occupy Arrakis
to mine the spice,

74
00:08:43.581 --> 00:08:46.830
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

75
00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:48.414
House Atreides will not refuse

76
00:08:48.415 --> 00:08:51.455
because of the tremendous power
they think they will gain.

77
00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:53.205
Then, at an appointed time,

78
00:08:53.206 --> 00:08:56.330
Baron Harkonnen
will return to Arrakis

79
00:08:56.331 --> 00:08:59.080
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

80
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.747
I have promised the baron

81
00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:04.705
five legions of
my Sardaukar terror troops.

82
00:09:04.706 --> 00:09:09.205
So the Harkonnens will
rid you of House Atreides.

83
00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:10.508
Yes.

84
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:13.322
One small point.

85
00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:16.205
Here it comes.

86
00:09:16.206 --> 00:09:19.289
We, ourselves,
foresee a slight problem

87
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.039
within House Atreides.

88
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.622
Paul. Paul Atreides.

89
00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:30.247
You mean, of course, Duke
Leto Atreides, his father?

90
00:09:30.248 --> 00:09:33.997
I mean Paul Atreides.

91
00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:37.695
We want him killed.

92
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.455
I did not say this.

93
00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:44.414
I am not here.

94
00:09:44.415 --> 00:09:46.290
I understand.

95
00:10:16.123 --> 00:10:20.918
Why would they
want the Duke's son killed?

96
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.197
We must have
a look at Paul Atreides.

97
00:10:28.206 --> 00:10:29.925
On Caladan.

98
00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:47.247
The powerful
Bene Gesserit sisterhood,

99
00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:48.747
for 90 generations,

100
00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:50.789
has been manipulating
bloodlines

101
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.039
to produce
the Kwisatz Haderach.

102
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.705
A super being.

103
00:10:54.706 --> 00:10:57.414
On Caladan, Jessica,

104
00:10:57.415 --> 00:10:58.914
a member of the sisterhood

105
00:10:58.915 --> 00:11:02.247
and the bound concubine of
Duke Leto Atreides

106
00:11:02.248 --> 00:11:05.539
had been ordered to
bear only daughters.

107
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.539
Because of her love
for the Duke,

108
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.915
she disobeyed
and gave birth to a son.

109
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:15.831
Paul. Paul Atreides.

110
00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:27.758
Here we are now. Caladan.

111
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.455
And 19 light-years beyond.

112
00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:32.789
Beyond Bene Tleilax.

113
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.914
The training
planet of the Mentats,

114
00:11:34.915 --> 00:11:36.539
the human computers.

115
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.997
Know a Mentat
by his red-stained lips.

116
00:11:39.998 --> 00:11:42.330
There, Arrakis.

117
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:43.999
Spice Mining.

118
00:11:44.498 --> 00:11:46.705
Carryalls lower
the harvester to the sand,

119
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:49.497
and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.

120
00:11:49.498 --> 00:11:53.040
Worms attack
all rhythmic vibrations.

121
00:11:53.706 --> 00:11:58.501
Weather. See storms'.
No Precipitation.

122
00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:02.425
Never one drop
of rain on Arrakis.

123
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.497
And the Harkonnens are near.
There.

124
00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:10.080
Giedi Prime
and the Baron Harkonnen.

125
00:12:10.081 --> 00:12:11.580
The enemy.

126
00:12:11.581 --> 00:12:14.705
The Baron Harkonnen
has sworn to destroy House Atreides,

127
00:12:14.706 --> 00:12:18.041
and steal the ducal
signet ring for himself.

128
00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:39.914
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

129
00:12:40.623 --> 00:12:44.747
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

130
00:12:44.748 --> 00:12:46.580
and Gurney
coming down the hall.

131
00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:48.455
Those sounds

132
00:12:48.748 --> 00:12:50.832
could be imitated!

133
00:12:52.665 --> 00:12:54.664
L'd know the difference.

134
00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:58.415
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.

135
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.997
My father sent you to test me.

136
00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:04.414
Music, then?

137
00:13:04.415 --> 00:13:06.164
No music.

138
00:13:06.165 --> 00:13:09.237
I'm packing this
for the crossing.

139
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:10.622
Shield practice.

140
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.747
Shield practice?

141
00:13:11.748 --> 00:13:14.330
Gurney, we had
practice this morning.

142
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:15.455
I'm not in the mood.

143
00:13:15.456 --> 00:13:17.247
Not in the mood?

144
00:13:17.248 --> 00:13:19.789
Mood's a thing for
cattle and love play.

145
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.914
Not fighting!

146
00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:22.791
I'm sorry, Gurney.

147
00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:24.988
Not sorry enough.

148
00:13:35.415 --> 00:13:37.122
What's wrong with Gurney?

149
00:13:37.123 --> 00:13:38.664
He's not faking this.

150
00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:43.145
Now, guard yourself for true!

151
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.613
Is this what you seek?

152
00:14:03.831 --> 00:14:05.497
Good.

153
00:14:05.498 --> 00:14:08.914
The slow blade
penetrates the shield.

154
00:14:08.915 --> 00:14:12.769
But, uh, look down.

155
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:17.664
We'd have joined
each other in death.

156
00:14:18.081 --> 00:14:21.727
You did seem finally
to get in the mood.

157
00:14:28.498 --> 00:14:31.247
Would you really
have drawn my blood?

158
00:14:31.248 --> 00:14:33.914
If you'd have fought
one whit below your abilities,

159
00:14:33.915 --> 00:14:37.560
I'd have given you
a good scar to remind you.

160
00:14:40.873 --> 00:14:42.830
Things have been
so serious here lately.

161
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.643
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

162
00:14:45.956 --> 00:14:47.988
Arrakis is real.

163
00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:51.737
The Harkonnens are real.

164
00:14:52.706 --> 00:14:54.247
Doctor Yueh.

165
00:14:54.248 --> 00:14:58.372
Do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

166
00:14:58.373 --> 00:15:01.914
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

167
00:15:01.915 --> 00:15:04.832
Only 125 meters long.

168
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.622
Only?

169
00:15:06.623 --> 00:15:08.747
There have been documented
sightings of worms

170
00:15:08.748 --> 00:15:13.543
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

171
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.581
That's far from where
we'll be in Arrakeen.

172
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.289
The desert belt
and the south polar region

173
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.414
are marked forbidden.

174
00:15:22.415 --> 00:15:24.414
How do the Fremen
survive there?

175
00:15:24.415 --> 00:15:26.664
We don't know much
about the Fremen.

176
00:15:26.665 --> 00:15:30.039
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

177
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.247
They have
blue-within-blue eyes.

178
00:15:32.248 --> 00:15:34.279
The eyes.

179
00:15:34.415 --> 00:15:36.133
Yes.

180
00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:39.906
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

181
00:15:39.998 --> 00:15:42.122
Could the spice
affect us in other ways?

182
00:15:42.123 --> 00:15:44.455
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

183
00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:45.655
For one,

184
00:15:45.665 --> 00:15:47.539
the Harkonnens would not have

185
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.020
given up their CHOAM Company
contract so easily.

186
00:15:52.748 --> 00:15:55.926
The Harkonnens are
our enemies, yes.

187
00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:59.957
But behind them,
l suspect, is the Emperor.

188
00:16:00.415 --> 00:16:03.435
You'll make a formidable duke.

189
00:16:07.956 --> 00:16:09.780
Now, remember,

190
00:16:10.373 --> 00:16:13.872
the first step
in avoiding a trap

191
00:16:13.873 --> 00:16:15.914
is knowing of its existence.

192
00:16:15.915 --> 00:16:19.122
I know, but if it is a trap

193
00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:20.414
then why are we going?

194
00:16:20.415 --> 00:16:22.916
We have our new army.

195
00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:24.770
Doctor Yueh,

196
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:27.906
put the weirding module on him.

197
00:16:31.915 --> 00:16:33.582
Well.

198
00:16:51.498 --> 00:16:53.164
Clear and lock the room!

199
00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:55.978
Detachment, stand down.

200
00:17:04.165 --> 00:17:06.299
Activate a fighter.

201
00:17:25.165 --> 00:17:28.550
Make the range two meters.

202
00:18:14.915 --> 00:18:17.362
Precise control.

203
00:18:46.748 --> 00:18:48.311
Duncan!

204
00:18:49.415 --> 00:18:53.739
Paul, l was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

205
00:18:54.123 --> 00:18:56.289
I have to go on ahead, alone,

206
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.830
l won't be seeing you
for a while.

207
00:18:57.831 --> 00:19:00.205
I wish you were
coming with us. Why?

208
00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:01.997
It's something for your father.

209
00:19:01.998 --> 00:19:04.499
He wants to talk to you.

210
00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.666
I'll see you on Arrakis.

211
00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:10.789
May the hand of God
be with you.

212
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.384
May the hand of God
be with us all, Duncan.

213
00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:31.080
Father.

214
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:33.893
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

215
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.259
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

216
00:19:38.915 --> 00:19:43.290
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

217
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.530
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan
say the same.

218
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:51.289
Makes me feel very proud.

219
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.102
I want you to be proud of me.

220
00:20:05.706 --> 00:20:07.842
I'll miss the sea.

221
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.165
But a person
needs new experiences.

222
00:20:13.706 --> 00:20:16.624
They jar something deep inside

223
00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.582
allowing him to grow.

224
00:20:21.165 --> 00:20:23.248
Without change,

225
00:20:24.456 --> 00:20:28.206
something sleeps inside us,

226
00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.247
and seldom awakens.

227
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.165
The sleeper must awaken.

228
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.071
Arrakis, Dune.

229
00:21:08.248 --> 00:21:10.800
Desert Planet.

230
00:21:13.915 --> 00:21:16.153
I will kill you.

231
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.510
The second moon.

232
00:21:28.248 --> 00:21:30.696
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

233
00:21:42.748 --> 00:21:45.205
l know she
has come to test him.

234
00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:49.790
No man has ever been
tested with the box.

235
00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:53.634
Tonight, I may lose my son.

236
00:22:17.581 --> 00:22:21.914
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

237
00:22:21.915 --> 00:22:23.039
Jessica!

238
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.414
It meant so much to him.

239
00:22:25.415 --> 00:22:29.530
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

240
00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:31.872
Desires don't come into this.

241
00:22:31.873 --> 00:22:33.414
An Atreides daughter

242
00:22:33.415 --> 00:22:35.497
could have been wed
to a Harkonnen heir

243
00:22:35.498 --> 00:22:37.747
and sealed the breach.

244
00:22:37.748 --> 00:22:41.810
We may lose
both bloodlines now.

245
00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:46.310
I vowed never to
regret my decision.

246
00:22:47.998 --> 00:22:50.372
I'll pay for
all my own mistakes.

247
00:22:50.373 --> 00:22:53.707
And your son will pay with you.

248
00:22:54.456 --> 00:22:57.842
Arrakis, Dune,

249
00:22:58.248 --> 00:23:00.695
Desert Planet.

250
00:23:01.165 --> 00:23:05.960
Moving.

251
00:23:26.748 --> 00:23:29.405
We'll salvage what we can.

252
00:23:29.415 --> 00:23:32.644
But l can tell you, dear God,

253
00:23:32.706 --> 00:23:35.580
for the father, nothing.

254
00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.830
For the father, nothing?

255
00:23:37.831 --> 00:23:41.372
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

256
00:23:41.373 --> 00:23:43.955
The Universe's super being?

257
00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:47.238
How dare you!

258
00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:49.955
My greatest student.

259
00:23:49.956 --> 00:23:54.488
And my greatest disappointment.

260
00:23:57.081 --> 00:24:00.207
He's awake.
He's listening to us.

261
00:24:00.748 --> 00:24:03.830
Good! Ready yourself,
young Paul Atreides.

262
00:24:03.831 --> 00:24:05.747
I want to see you
in your mother's chambers

263
00:24:05.748 --> 00:24:07.779
in one-quarter
of an hour.

264
00:24:10.706 --> 00:24:12.061
Paul.

265
00:24:13.123 --> 00:24:15.570
This is very important.

266
00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:23.353
Kwisatz Haderach?
The super being?

267
00:24:23.915 --> 00:24:26.363
For the father, nothing?

268
00:24:40.248 --> 00:24:41.601
Vas.

269
00:24:57.081 --> 00:25:00.936
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

270
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.665
She's going to observe you.

271
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:08.914
Please.

272
00:25:08.915 --> 00:25:10.478
Jessica,

273
00:25:11.248 --> 00:25:13.122
you know it must be done.

274
00:25:13.123 --> 00:25:15.207
Your Reverence.

275
00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:17.831
What does she fear?

276
00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:19.747
What about my father?

277
00:25:19.748 --> 00:25:21.051
Paul,

278
00:25:22.081 --> 00:25:26.612
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

279
00:25:34.373 --> 00:25:37.290
Now, you,

280
00:25:38.581 --> 00:25:40.249
come here.

281
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:43.737
She's using the Voice.

282
00:25:43.956 --> 00:25:45.080
No.

283
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:47.529
Some strength there.

284
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.207
Surprising.

285
00:25:49.706 --> 00:25:52.674
Come here!

286
00:25:52.748 --> 00:25:54.747
Here.

287
00:25:54.748 --> 00:25:58.654
Come here.

288
00:26:10.706 --> 00:26:12.633
Do you see this?

289
00:26:14.748 --> 00:26:17.925
Put your right hand in the box.

290
00:26:18.498 --> 00:26:19.872
What's in the box?

291
00:26:19.873 --> 00:26:21.122
Pain.

292
00:26:21.123 --> 00:26:22.581
Stop.

293
00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.477
Put your hand in the box.

294
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.330
I hold at your neck
the gom jabbar.

295
00:26:34.331 --> 00:26:38.446
This one kills only animals.

296
00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:41.205
Are you suggesting
the Duke's son is an animal?

297
00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:45.247
Let us say, l suggest
you may be human.

298
00:26:45.248 --> 00:26:49.080
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

299
00:26:49.081 --> 00:26:50.955
Your instinct will be

300
00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:53.873
to remove your hand
from the box.

301
00:26:53.956 --> 00:26:55.727
If you do so,

302
00:26:56.831 --> 00:26:58.343
you die.

303
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.373
You will feel

304
00:27:04.915 --> 00:27:07.051
an itching

305
00:27:09.373 --> 00:27:10.832
there.

306
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:16.376
Now, the itching
becomes burning.

307
00:27:17.748 --> 00:27:21.080
Heat upon heat upon heat.

308
00:27:21.081 --> 00:27:22.247
It burns.

309
00:27:22.248 --> 00:27:24.080
Silence! Silence!

310
00:27:24.081 --> 00:27:27.830
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

311
00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:31.372
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

312
00:27:31.373 --> 00:27:34.122
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass

313
00:27:34.123 --> 00:27:37.205
over me and through me.
l must not fear.

314
00:27:37.206 --> 00:27:38.747
You feel the flesh crisping.

315
00:27:38.748 --> 00:27:40.205
Fear is the mind killer.

316
00:27:40.206 --> 00:27:43.622
Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.

317
00:27:43.623 --> 00:27:44.747
I will face my fear.

318
00:27:44.748 --> 00:27:47.925
Flesh dropping off.

319
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.122
Fear is the little death.

320
00:27:52.123 --> 00:27:54.247
I must not fear.

321
00:27:54.248 --> 00:27:59.043
Fear is the little death.
I'm...

322
00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:00.372
The pain!

323
00:28:00.373 --> 00:28:02.612
No! Enough!

324
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:07.404
Kull wahad!

325
00:28:08.248 --> 00:28:11.529
No woman child
ever withstood that much.

326
00:28:14.248 --> 00:28:19.043
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

327
00:28:21.498 --> 00:28:23.113
Do it!

328
00:28:29.206 --> 00:28:31.289
Pain by nerve induction.

329
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.247
A human can resist any pain.

330
00:28:33.248 --> 00:28:36.622
Our test is
crisis and observation.

331
00:28:36.623 --> 00:28:38.414
I see the truth of it.

332
00:28:38.415 --> 00:28:40.706
Could he be the one?

333
00:28:40.873 --> 00:28:42.382
Maybe.

334
00:28:42.915 --> 00:28:45.778
But will he be ours to control?

335
00:28:47.623 --> 00:28:50.124
Tell me of your
home world, Usul.

336
00:28:53.415 --> 00:28:57.205
Do you know of
the Water of Life?

337
00:28:57.206 --> 00:29:00.247
The bile from the newborn
worms of Arrakis?

338
00:29:00.248 --> 00:29:01.330
I have heard of it.

339
00:29:01.331 --> 00:29:03.414
It is very dangerous.

340
00:29:03.415 --> 00:29:07.425
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

341
00:29:08.373 --> 00:29:10.300
There is a place

342
00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:13.705
terrifying to us,

343
00:29:13.706 --> 00:29:15.320
to women.

344
00:29:15.915 --> 00:29:17.686
It is said

345
00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:20.874
a man will come.

346
00:29:21.581 --> 00:29:23.822
The Kwisatz Haderach.

347
00:29:24.665 --> 00:29:27.268
He will go where we cannot.

348
00:29:29.415 --> 00:29:31.653
Many men have tried.

349
00:29:32.081 --> 00:29:34.330
They tried and failed?

350
00:29:34.331 --> 00:29:36.728
They tried and died.

351
00:29:37.581 --> 00:29:38.780
Jessica.

352
00:29:44.665 --> 00:29:47.061
My son lives!

353
00:29:53.081 --> 00:29:55.843
I sense your teachings in him.

354
00:29:56.248 --> 00:29:58.872
Lgnore the regular order
of training.

355
00:29:58.873 --> 00:30:01.414
His safety requires the Voice.

356
00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:03.497
I've heard enough of my safety.

357
00:30:03.498 --> 00:30:05.622
What about my father?

358
00:30:05.623 --> 00:30:07.237
I heard your talking.

359
00:30:07.248 --> 00:30:09.330
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

360
00:30:09.331 --> 00:30:10.705
Paul.
Well, he's not.

361
00:30:10.706 --> 00:30:13.414
And he won't die.
Tell me he won't die.

362
00:30:13.415 --> 00:30:15.247
What can be done has been done.

363
00:30:15.248 --> 00:30:17.279
Mother, tell me!

364
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.622
Mentat Piter De Vries.

365
00:30:44.623 --> 00:30:47.080
Message for
Mentat Piter De Vries.

366
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:50.467
The Baron is
impatient for Leto's reply.

367
00:30:52.831 --> 00:30:55.080
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

368
00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:57.705
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

369
00:30:57.706 --> 00:31:00.247
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

370
00:31:00.248 --> 00:31:03.789
It is by will alone
l set my mind in motion.

371
00:31:06.248 --> 00:31:08.539
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

372
00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.080
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

373
00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:13.414
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

374
00:31:13.415 --> 00:31:16.435
It is by will alone
I set my mind in motion.

375
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:20.580
My lord.

376
00:32:20.581 --> 00:32:22.040
Piter!

377
00:32:23.706 --> 00:32:26.164
The Atreides will be
leaving Caladan soon, Baron,

378
00:32:26.165 --> 00:32:29.580
and l have here
your answer from Duke Leto.

379
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:31.789
What does Leto say, Piter?

380
00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:34.705
He wishes to inform you
that vendetta,

381
00:32:34.706 --> 00:32:37.580
as he puts it,
using the ancient tongue,

382
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:40.664
the art of kanly,
is still alive.

383
00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:44.727
He does not wish
to meet or speak with you.

384
00:32:45.415 --> 00:32:48.487
I've made my peace gesture.

385
00:32:48.956 --> 00:32:52.237
The forms of kanly
have been obeyed.

386
00:32:53.373 --> 00:32:55.874
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

387
00:33:22.415 --> 00:33:24.289
As you instructed me,

388
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.580
l have enlightened your nephews

389
00:33:26.581 --> 00:33:27.955
concerning my plan...

390
00:33:27.956 --> 00:33:29.519
My plan.

391
00:33:30.581 --> 00:33:35.376
The plan to crush the Atreides.

392
00:33:35.873 --> 00:33:37.489
Feyd,

393
00:33:38.373 --> 00:33:40.665
Rabban,

394
00:33:40.706 --> 00:33:43.154
go quietly.

395
00:33:44.248 --> 00:33:47.414
No other great house
of the Landsraad

396
00:33:47.415 --> 00:33:52.080
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

397
00:33:52.081 --> 00:33:56.877
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

398
00:33:57.456 --> 00:33:59.289
and the Emperor.

399
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.997
Put the pick in there, Pete,

400
00:34:02.415 --> 00:34:06.321
and turn it round real neat.

401
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.885
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

402
00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:34.112
Your skin, love to me.

403
00:34:34.581 --> 00:34:38.164
Your diseases
lovingly cared for,

404
00:34:38.165 --> 00:34:40.769
for all eternity.

405
00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:49.705
l will have
Arrakis back for myself!

406
00:34:49.706 --> 00:34:53.247
He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!

407
00:34:53.248 --> 00:34:55.664
And what Piter did not tell you

408
00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:58.997
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

409
00:34:58.998 --> 00:35:02.331
very close to Duke Leto.

410
00:35:02.415 --> 00:35:04.997
This person, this traitor

411
00:35:04.998 --> 00:35:08.872
will be worth more to us
than 10 legions of Sardaukar.

412
00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:11.216
And who is this traitor?

413
00:35:11.956 --> 00:35:14.289
l won't tell you
who the traitor is,

414
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.529
or when we'll attack.

415
00:35:16.831 --> 00:35:18.343
However,

416
00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:21.997
the Duke will die before
these eyes and he'll know...

417
00:35:21.998 --> 00:35:24.539
He'll know that it is l,

418
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:29.335
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

419
00:36:45.873 --> 00:36:49.780
This is what I'll do
to the Duke and his family.

420
00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.426
Oh, I'll miss Caladan so much.

421
00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.955
Caladan.

422
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:54.217
Soon they will
begin to fold space.

423
00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:58.164
Far off in the control
rooms of spice gas.

424
00:38:58.165 --> 00:39:01.862
Traveling without moving.

425
00:41:19.498 --> 00:41:21.841
And now,

426
00:41:21.915 --> 00:41:23.789
the prophecy.

427
00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:27.789
One will come.

428
00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:32.279
The voice from the outer world.

429
00:41:32.331 --> 00:41:35.093
Bringing the Holy War,

430
00:41:35.373 --> 00:41:37.145
the Jihad,

431
00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:40.164
which will
cleanse the Universe,

432
00:41:40.165 --> 00:41:44.800
and bring us out of darkness.

433
00:42:11.498 --> 00:42:14.039
House Atreides
took control of Arrakis

434
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.789
63 standard days
into the year 10191.

435
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.747
It was known that
the Harkonnens,

436
00:42:20.748 --> 00:42:22.580
the former rulers of Arrakis

437
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:25.914
would leave many
suicide troops behind.

438
00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:30.354
Atreides' patrols were doubled.

439
00:42:41.165 --> 00:42:42.622
Duncan!

440
00:42:45.581 --> 00:42:48.580
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

441
00:42:48.581 --> 00:42:50.093
Tell me.

442
00:42:50.665 --> 00:42:52.247
Why haven't we heard from you?

443
00:42:52.248 --> 00:42:53.705
My lord,

444
00:42:53.706 --> 00:42:55.894
l suspect so much.

445
00:42:57.373 --> 00:42:59.664
I think they are
the allies we seek.

446
00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:01.539
They are strong, fierce.

447
00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.622
They do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly.

448
00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:07.289
As you know,
the lmperium has never

449
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.539
been able to take
a census of the Fremen.

450
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.705
Everyone thinks
that there are but few

451
00:43:11.706 --> 00:43:14.039
wandering here and there
in the desert.

452
00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.811
My lord,

453
00:43:16.206 --> 00:43:20.039
l suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

454
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.102
That the Fremen exist
in vast numbers.

455
00:43:24.331 --> 00:43:25.947
Vast.

456
00:43:26.248 --> 00:43:31.043
And it is they
who control Arrakis.

457
00:43:36.748 --> 00:43:38.955
Each trooper will be charged

458
00:43:38.956 --> 00:43:41.455
with responsibility
for preserving water.

459
00:43:41.456 --> 00:43:43.580
Our existence
as an operating army

460
00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:46.705
depends on these following
water-saving procedures.

461
00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:49.831
Remember, water is life.

462
00:43:53.206 --> 00:43:56.705
Why is the shield not yet up?

463
00:43:56.706 --> 00:44:00.539
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

464
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.207
I think it'll go up now, sir.

465
00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:10.550
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

466
00:44:20.831 --> 00:44:24.009
House shields activated.

467
00:44:30.498 --> 00:44:32.372
Duke Leto is now here.

468
00:44:32.373 --> 00:44:35.498
Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.

469
00:44:52.581 --> 00:44:55.082
So you are Doctor Kynes.

470
00:44:55.165 --> 00:44:57.039
The Judge of the Change.

471
00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.330
And the imperial
Ecologist, Sire.

472
00:44:59.331 --> 00:45:01.164
Our intelligence informs us

473
00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:04.122
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.

474
00:45:04.123 --> 00:45:07.093
The process of
removal continues.

475
00:45:07.373 --> 00:45:09.664
This is my son, Paul.

476
00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.789
Are you a Fremen?

477
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.997
I've been on Arrakis
in the service of the Emperor

478
00:45:13.998 --> 00:45:16.122
long enough
for my eyes to change.

479
00:45:16.123 --> 00:45:18.414
In the service
of the Emperor.

480
00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.205
We are in your hands, Doctor.

481
00:45:20.206 --> 00:45:22.997
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

482
00:45:22.998 --> 00:45:26.247
Will you give us an explanation
of their workings?

483
00:45:26.248 --> 00:45:29.747
Well, this is a still suit
of Fremen manufacture,

484
00:45:29.748 --> 00:45:31.414
the most efficient type
on Arrakis.

485
00:45:31.415 --> 00:45:32.717
Basically...

486
00:45:36.581 --> 00:45:38.508
it's all right, Gurney.

487
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.258
Yes, Sire.

488
00:45:41.998 --> 00:45:43.705
Basically,

489
00:45:43.706 --> 00:45:45.705
it's a high-efficiency
filter,

490
00:45:45.706 --> 00:45:47.738
and heat exchange system.

491
00:45:48.165 --> 00:45:51.122
Perspiration passes
through the first layer

492
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:53.455
and is gathered in the second.

493
00:45:53.456 --> 00:45:55.705
The salt is separated.

494
00:45:55.706 --> 00:45:59.789
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

495
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.372
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets

496
00:46:03.373 --> 00:46:04.664
from which you can drink

497
00:46:04.665 --> 00:46:08.727
through this tube
around your neck.

498
00:46:08.956 --> 00:46:12.747
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

499
00:46:12.748 --> 00:46:16.083
Should you be
in the open desert,

500
00:46:16.165 --> 00:46:18.580
remember to breathe in
through your mouth

501
00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:21.414
and out through this nose tube.

502
00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:23.955
With a Fremen suit
in good working condition,

503
00:46:23.956 --> 00:46:26.372
life can be sustained
for weeks,

504
00:46:26.373 --> 00:46:29.758
even in the deep desert, Sire.

505
00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:32.550
My thanks.

506
00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:35.165
With your permission.

507
00:46:36.831 --> 00:46:39.164
You've worn a stillsuit before.

508
00:46:39.165 --> 00:46:40.779
No.

509
00:46:40.915 --> 00:46:43.289
Your suit is
fitted desert fashion.

510
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.321
Who told you how to do that?

511
00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:47.050
No one.

512
00:46:47.373 --> 00:46:49.874
It seemed the proper way.

513
00:46:52.581 --> 00:46:54.039
That it is.

514
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:58.363
He shall know
your ways as if born to them.

515
00:46:59.498 --> 00:47:02.051
We're wasting time, Sire.

516
00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:20.946
That language?
Translate it.

517
00:47:23.581 --> 00:47:25.613
Very faint.

518
00:47:30.206 --> 00:47:32.081
Harkonnen!

519
00:47:37.873 --> 00:47:40.476
Air speed, zero-five.

520
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:44.872
Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.

521
00:47:44.873 --> 00:47:47.476
Air speed, three-zero.

522
00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.041
...35% percent
efficiency.

523
00:48:00.081 --> 00:48:01.705
That's where l told
your sandmaster

524
00:48:01.706 --> 00:48:03.687
to concentrate
the harvesting today.

525
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:07.299
Southeast,
over the Shield Wall.

526
00:48:08.873 --> 00:48:13.404
Ambient
temperature, 350 degrees Kelvin.

527
00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:16.706
Air speed, one-three-zero.

528
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.539
Caution. You've now cleared
protective Shield Wall

529
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:24.560
and entered open desert.

530
00:48:32.748 --> 00:48:34.936
Will we see a worm?

531
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:38.455
Where there is spice and spice
mining, there are always worms.

532
00:48:38.456 --> 00:48:39.580
Always?

533
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:40.988
Always.

534
00:48:41.373 --> 00:48:43.456
Why do they come?

535
00:48:43.998 --> 00:48:46.603
To protect their territory.

536
00:48:46.665 --> 00:48:48.789
Vibrations attract them.

537
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:52.020
He must be a
Fremen or in with them.

538
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.247
He's studying us.

539
00:48:54.248 --> 00:48:57.060
He's hiding something
about the spice.

540
00:48:57.165 --> 00:49:00.550
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

541
00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.835
As l said, they defend
the spice sands.

542
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.926
As to their relationship
with the spice,

543
00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.143
who knows?

544
00:49:28.873 --> 00:49:32.050
My message, it's here.

545
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.580
There are more
enemy bodies coming in

546
00:49:37.581 --> 00:49:40.656
for your inspection,
Doctor Yueh.

547
00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.455
Are you all right?

548
00:49:46.456 --> 00:49:48.383
Yes, I'm fine.

549
00:49:48.415 --> 00:49:50.551
Thank you, Thufir.

550
00:49:54.373 --> 00:49:55.914
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

551
00:49:55.915 --> 00:49:58.206
That's it. Spice mining.

552
00:49:58.873 --> 00:50:01.583
No other cloud quite like it.

553
00:50:04.456 --> 00:50:06.437
Wormsign?

554
00:50:06.456 --> 00:50:07.664
Is it wormsign?

555
00:50:07.665 --> 00:50:10.622
Yes. Worm. Big one.

556
00:50:10.623 --> 00:50:13.853
You've got sharp eyes.
May l?

557
00:50:16.498 --> 00:50:19.872
Calling Harvester Pad Nine.
Wormsign.

558
00:50:19.873 --> 00:50:21.455
Who calls Pad Nine?

559
00:50:21.456 --> 00:50:22.664
Don't mention the Duke.

560
00:50:22.665 --> 00:50:25.080
This is an un-coded channel.

561
00:50:25.081 --> 00:50:27.372
Unlisted flight
northeast of you.

562
00:50:27.373 --> 00:50:29.747
Wormsign on intercept course.

563
00:50:29.748 --> 00:50:32.580
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

564
00:50:32.581 --> 00:50:35.205
Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.

565
00:50:35.206 --> 00:50:37.915
Contact in 16 minutes minus.

566
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.622
Very precise estimate.

567
00:50:39.623 --> 00:50:41.655
Who's on that unlisted flight?

568
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.497
What happens now?

569
00:50:45.498 --> 00:50:46.539
The carryall will come

570
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:49.456
and lift off
the spice harvester.

571
00:50:50.206 --> 00:50:52.122
Try to get in close
over the harvester.

572
00:50:52.123 --> 00:50:55.039
You'll find this
interesting, Sire.

573
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.122
They work until
the very last minute.

574
00:50:57.123 --> 00:51:00.330
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

575
00:51:00.331 --> 00:51:01.843
It isn't answering.

576
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:04.705
The worm is
eight minutes away, Sire.

577
00:51:04.706 --> 00:51:07.497
Spotter control, give
me a report by the numbers.

578
00:51:07.498 --> 00:51:08.539
Report One.

579
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:09.622
No contact.

580
00:51:09.623 --> 00:51:11.039
Report two.

581
00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.164
Negative.

582
00:51:12.165 --> 00:51:13.205
Report Three.

583
00:51:13.206 --> 00:51:14.330
Negative, Sire.

584
00:51:14.331 --> 00:51:15.372
Report four.

585
00:51:15.373 --> 00:51:17.872
No contact.
Repeat, no contact.

586
00:51:17.873 --> 00:51:19.789
I think they've
got our carryall.

587
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.497
Damn it! Harkonnens.

588
00:51:22.498 --> 00:51:24.705
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

589
00:51:24.706 --> 00:51:26.872
All spotters are
ordered to comply.

590
00:51:26.873 --> 00:51:28.164
Ordered by whom?

591
00:51:28.165 --> 00:51:29.872
Duke Leto Atreides.

592
00:51:29.873 --> 00:51:31.872
Yes. Yes, Sire.

593
00:51:31.873 --> 00:51:33.205
How many men do you have?

594
00:51:33.206 --> 00:51:35.185
Full crew, 26 men.

595
00:51:35.248 --> 00:51:37.455
But, Sire, we can't
leave all this spice.

596
00:51:37.456 --> 00:51:38.872
Damn the spice!

597
00:51:38.873 --> 00:51:40.489
Get out of there!

598
00:51:49.706 --> 00:51:51.872
Two men in
each of the spotters!

599
00:51:51.873 --> 00:51:53.539
You, over here!

600
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:57.081
Run! Run!

601
00:52:02.415 --> 00:52:05.205
I can't see him yet,
but he is very close now.

602
00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:08.539
Damn sloppy.
Really damn sloppy.

603
00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.883
Come on, boys.
Come on.

604
00:52:14.581 --> 00:52:16.613
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

605
00:52:16.748 --> 00:52:18.676
Spice.

606
00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:23.342
Pure unrefined spice.

607
00:52:28.623 --> 00:52:31.904
Here he is!
We've got to go!

608
00:52:40.998 --> 00:52:42.872
Bless the Maker and his water.

609
00:52:42.873 --> 00:52:44.539
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

610
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.289
May His passing
cleanse the world.

611
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:48.497
What's that you're saying?

612
00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.060
Nothing.

613
00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:28.634
Gods, what a monster.

614
00:53:37.206 --> 00:53:40.905
Someone is going to
pay for this, l promise.

615
00:53:43.165 --> 00:53:46.830
He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.

616
00:53:46.831 --> 00:53:51.497
I must admit,
against all better judgment,

617
00:53:51.498 --> 00:53:53.530
l like this Duke.

618
00:54:39.581 --> 00:54:43.164
My lady, the local people,

619
00:54:43.165 --> 00:54:46.039
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

620
00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.747
Hawat has cleared them.

621
00:54:51.373 --> 00:54:53.561
Excuse me, my lady.

622
00:54:53.998 --> 00:54:58.793
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

623
00:55:07.456 --> 00:55:09.956
When you said Harkonnens,

624
00:55:10.956 --> 00:55:15.018
l didn't know you had
so much reason to hate them.

625
00:55:17.706 --> 00:55:19.789
Well, my wife...

626
00:55:21.331 --> 00:55:25.186
But, of course, you...
You didn't know my wife.

627
00:55:26.248 --> 00:55:28.071
The Har...

628
00:55:28.206 --> 00:55:29.830
Forgive me.

629
00:55:29.831 --> 00:55:32.018
They must have killed her.

630
00:55:32.331 --> 00:55:35.925
Please excuse me
if l can't talk about it.

631
00:55:39.956 --> 00:55:44.751
He's holding something back.
Yet.

632
00:55:45.165 --> 00:55:47.872
There's
the Imperial conditioning.

633
00:55:48.748 --> 00:55:51.352
Assurance of trust.

634
00:55:57.206 --> 00:56:01.872
The Bene
Gesserit mother, the legend.

635
00:56:01.873 --> 00:56:03.956
Where is your son?

636
00:56:04.581 --> 00:56:08.956
I must warn you.
You are in great danger.

637
00:56:10.915 --> 00:56:12.737
Safe.

638
00:56:28.873 --> 00:56:30.644
Spice.

639
00:56:48.831 --> 00:56:51.488
What is it doing to me?

640
00:57:02.873 --> 00:57:04.956
Second moon.

641
00:57:06.415 --> 00:57:09.122
The sleeper must awaken.

642
00:57:09.123 --> 00:57:11.520
Am l the one?

643
00:57:24.956 --> 00:57:27.353
A hunter-seeker!

644
00:57:27.373 --> 00:57:29.820
It can't get me
if l don't move.

645
00:57:30.373 --> 00:57:33.343
It's too dark in here
for it to see clearly.

646
00:57:49.373 --> 00:57:51.976
I've got to try to grab it.

647
00:57:51.998 --> 00:57:55.164
The suspensor field will make
it slippery on the bottom.

648
00:57:55.165 --> 00:57:57.716
I must grip it tightly.

649
00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:02.103
Who is operating that thing?

650
00:58:02.206 --> 00:58:05.124
It has to be someone
in the palace.

651
00:58:05.623 --> 00:58:06.872
I could shout for help,

652
00:58:06.873 --> 00:58:09.581
but it would kill whoever
opened the door.

653
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:29.737
Hold still.

654
00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.883
It would have killed me.

655
00:58:56.581 --> 00:59:00.800
I was its target.
it went to the motion.

656
00:59:00.831 --> 00:59:02.414
Who are you?

657
00:59:02.415 --> 00:59:05.020
I am the Shadout Mapes,

658
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:07.581
the housekeeper.

659
00:59:07.665 --> 00:59:11.705
I must cleanse
the way between us.

660
00:59:11.706 --> 00:59:16.039
You saved my life, and
we Fremen pay our debts.

661
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.580
A Fremen.

662
00:59:17.581 --> 00:59:19.705
It is known to us

663
00:59:19.706 --> 00:59:22.122
that you've a traitor
in your midst.

664
00:59:22.123 --> 00:59:24.705
Who it is, we cannot say.

665
00:59:24.706 --> 00:59:27.727
But we are certain of it.

666
00:59:37.415 --> 00:59:39.029
A traitor.

667
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.841
Set up a sonar probe
immediately.

668
01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.622
Harkonnen.

669
01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:10.072
They've tried to take
the life of my son.

670
01:00:13.373 --> 01:00:16.955
Sector 6 through 80
progress reports, Sire.

671
01:00:16.956 --> 01:00:18.937
Take it, Thufir.

672
01:00:21.706 --> 01:00:24.705
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over,

673
01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:28.561
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

674
01:00:32.998 --> 01:00:37.793
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

675
01:00:40.748 --> 01:00:43.249
Uh, the palace is now secure.

676
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.696
The city of Arrakeen
is under martial law.

677
01:00:47.748 --> 01:00:51.705
We have troops here
headquartered underground

678
01:00:51.706 --> 01:00:54.622
on sub-floors
6 through 10.

679
01:00:54.623 --> 01:00:56.664
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen,

680
01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:58.914
and we have some
on the airfield.

681
01:00:58.915 --> 01:01:02.664
Our new army is still
in training, but everything,

682
01:01:02.665 --> 01:01:04.289
everything is shielded.

683
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.197
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

684
01:02:00.665 --> 01:02:03.528
Sleep well, my son.

685
01:02:13.331 --> 01:02:17.031
Um, Father,

686
01:02:18.123 --> 01:02:19.842
drugged.

687
01:02:25.956 --> 01:02:29.039
Jessica, what is wrong?

688
01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.321
Forgive me,
my beloved concubine.

689
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.779
I should have married you.

690
01:02:35.373 --> 01:02:37.872
Why hold a dream
to ascend to the throne

691
01:02:37.873 --> 01:02:40.320
through a political marriage?

692
01:02:41.873 --> 01:02:44.320
I should have married you.

693
01:03:08.498 --> 01:03:10.425
What happened?

694
01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:33.747
Yueh!

695
01:03:33.748 --> 01:03:36.195
He sabotaged
the house generators.

696
01:03:36.456 --> 01:03:37.863
We are wide open!

697
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:44.747
House shield deactivating.

698
01:03:44.748 --> 01:03:48.122
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

699
01:03:48.123 --> 01:03:50.372
I've brought
House Atreides down.

700
01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:51.705
Why?

701
01:03:51.706 --> 01:03:56.247
I wish to kill a man.
Not you, my dear Duke.

702
01:03:56.248 --> 01:03:58.205
You were already dead.

703
01:03:58.206 --> 01:04:01.205
But you'll get close
to the Baron before you die.

704
01:04:01.206 --> 01:04:04.872
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

705
01:04:04.873 --> 01:04:07.373
You can still attack!

706
01:04:07.956 --> 01:04:10.205
When you see the Baron,

707
01:04:10.206 --> 01:04:13.539
you'll have a new
poison gas tooth.

708
01:04:14.373 --> 01:04:18.332
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

709
01:04:18.873 --> 01:04:23.668
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

710
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:25.414
Refuse.

711
01:04:25.415 --> 01:04:26.873
No! You mustn't!

712
01:04:27.456 --> 01:04:29.247
Because, in return,

713
01:04:29.248 --> 01:04:33.414
I'll save the lives
of your Paul and Jessica.

714
01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:39.445
For Paul.

715
01:04:43.665 --> 01:04:44.915
Ahhh!

716
01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:58.039
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

717
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.841
The tooth! The tooth!

718
01:05:02.373 --> 01:05:06.695
The shield is down!
The shield is down!

719
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.019
Open the doors!

720
01:05:10.623 --> 01:05:12.132
Signals!

721
01:05:14.165 --> 01:05:15.705
Get that shield up!

722
01:05:15.706 --> 01:05:19.352
The shield! The shield!

723
01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:46.041
The weirding modules!
Destroyed!

724
01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:37.706
Long live Duke Leto!

725
01:06:59.623 --> 01:07:02.593
The drug was timed.

726
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.622
Dr. Yueh has been
very valuable to us.

727
01:07:10.331 --> 01:07:14.186
What a pity
you must remain gagged.

728
01:07:14.665 --> 01:07:16.997
We can't let
ourselves be swayed

729
01:07:16.998 --> 01:07:19.759
by your witch's voice,
now, can we?

730
01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:23.456
Leto, where are you?

731
01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:27.781
How simple to subdue us.

732
01:07:40.706 --> 01:07:42.790
Goodbye, Jessica.

733
01:07:43.373 --> 01:07:45.874
And goodbye to your sweet son.

734
01:07:46.706 --> 01:07:49.728
I want to spit
once on your head.

735
01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:52.644
Just some spittle in your face.

736
01:07:55.998 --> 01:07:57.717
What a luxury!

737
01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:06.207
We were ordered to kill them.
So kill them!

738
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:13.206
l wish this was Paul.

739
01:08:18.915 --> 01:08:21.519
I knew Yueh's wife.

740
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.228
I was the one who broke
his imperial conditioning.

741
01:08:32.165 --> 01:08:35.290
I've thought of
many pleasures with you.

742
01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:39.414
It is perhaps
better that you die

743
01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.759
in the innards of a worm.

744
01:08:52.373 --> 01:08:55.247
What are your orders, Piter?

745
01:08:55.248 --> 01:08:59.154
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

746
01:08:59.331 --> 01:09:01.883
The worms will
destroy the evidence.

747
01:09:01.956 --> 01:09:04.769
Their bodies
must never be found.

748
01:09:18.415 --> 01:09:20.205
They're down on this floor
somewhere.

749
01:09:20.206 --> 01:09:21.561
Down there.

750
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.810
Duncan!

751
01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:48.540
Get off!

752
01:09:52.873 --> 01:09:55.580
You wish now to join your wife?

753
01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:57.613
Ls that it, traitor?

754
01:09:58.165 --> 01:09:59.872
She lives?

755
01:09:59.873 --> 01:10:01.800
You wish to join her?

756
01:10:05.206 --> 01:10:07.187
Join her, then.

757
01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.903
You think you've defeated me?

758
01:10:20.165 --> 01:10:24.960
You think l don't know
what I've gained, for my wife!

759
01:10:31.706 --> 01:10:33.374
Take him away.

760
01:10:55.456 --> 01:10:57.437
Yueh's sign.

761
01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.914
He's left us stillsuits.

762
01:11:11.206 --> 01:11:13.497
Don't touch my mother!

763
01:11:13.498 --> 01:11:15.539
He's trying the Voice.

764
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.539
The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.

765
01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:20.789
Did you hear a noise
from the little one, huh?

766
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:23.966
No, l didn't hear anything.

767
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:28.768
The little one.

768
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:43.894
Remove her gag.

769
01:11:43.998 --> 01:11:45.613
Excellent!

770
01:12:02.206 --> 01:12:05.593
There's no
need to fight over me.

771
01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.457
A poisoned blade.

772
01:12:25.873 --> 01:12:30.668
First cut my son's bonds.

773
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.061
That's it.

774
01:12:53.748 --> 01:12:55.467
Oh, my God.

775
01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.862
It's under control.

776
01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:40.956
Duke Leto Atreides.

777
01:13:43.706 --> 01:13:47.406
Where is the ducal signet ring?

778
01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.186
I must have his ring.

779
01:13:52.998 --> 01:13:54.612
The ring!

780
01:13:57.581 --> 01:14:01.643
He was brought to us
as is, my lord Baron.

781
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:06.071
You killed the doctor
too soon, you fool!

782
01:14:06.623 --> 01:14:10.872
The doctor,
Yueh, what did he say?

783
01:14:10.873 --> 01:14:13.374
Paul and Jessica safe.

784
01:14:13.498 --> 01:14:16.103
Yes. The tooth!

785
01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.164
He's coming around, Baron.

786
01:14:18.165 --> 01:14:19.884
Where's your ring?

787
01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:21.956
Huh?

788
01:14:22.748 --> 01:14:24.164
You do not answer?

789
01:14:24.165 --> 01:14:26.955
Wait! Wait!

790
01:14:26.956 --> 01:14:30.029
You must come closer.

791
01:14:30.206 --> 01:14:34.581
The water of my life

792
01:14:36.165 --> 01:14:37.674
for Paul.

793
01:14:37.831 --> 01:14:41.946
He's crying.
He's crying!

794
01:14:42.165 --> 01:14:44.560
What does that mean, Piter?

795
01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:50.208
Come closer, Baron.

796
01:14:55.498 --> 01:14:56.801
No!

797
01:14:58.123 --> 01:14:59.895
Jessica!

798
01:15:01.415 --> 01:15:03.186
Leto!

799
01:15:04.165 --> 01:15:06.122
Leto, he's dead!

800
01:15:06.123 --> 01:15:08.519
No, he's dead!

801
01:15:09.415 --> 01:15:10.664
I know.

802
01:15:18.206 --> 01:15:20.290
Am l alive?

803
01:15:21.956 --> 01:15:23.039
I'm alive?

804
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.342
Yes,

805
01:15:25.373 --> 01:15:27.873
you're alive, my Baron.

806
01:15:28.165 --> 01:15:30.404
I'm alive, eh?

807
01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:35.336
I'm alive!

808
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:47.455
l can't maintain any altitude.

809
01:15:47.456 --> 01:15:50.529
We'll never reach
the safety of rock!

810
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.384
Maybe that small rock.

811
01:15:56.456 --> 01:15:58.372
Where are we, do you think?

812
01:15:58.373 --> 01:16:00.560
The south polar regions.

813
01:16:00.581 --> 01:16:04.905
The forbidden area.
Hold on.

814
01:16:13.206 --> 01:16:14.664
Hurry!

815
01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:19.549
Take the stillsuits!

816
01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.205
Hurry!

817
01:16:22.206 --> 01:16:24.654
This crash might bring a worm.

818
01:16:29.415 --> 01:16:30.705
The signet.

819
01:16:30.706 --> 01:16:34.301
A million deaths
are not enough for Yueh!

820
01:16:57.331 --> 01:16:59.467
Where are my feelings?

821
01:16:59.498 --> 01:17:01.789
I feel for no one.

822
01:17:05.706 --> 01:17:07.999
The second moon.

823
01:17:22.956 --> 01:17:26.747
l mean Paul Atreides.

824
01:17:26.748 --> 01:17:29.820
We want him killed.

825
01:17:30.165 --> 01:17:31.289
Why?

826
01:17:31.290 --> 01:17:33.789
Why do they want me killed?

827
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:37.384
It has to be something
to do with the spice.

828
01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.207
But what?

829
01:17:45.248 --> 01:17:49.883
He who controls the
spice, controls the Universe!

830
01:17:56.831 --> 01:18:00.062
This moon holds my future.

831
01:18:12.665 --> 01:18:16.675
Never one drop of rain
on Arrakis.

832
01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:23.966
The sleeper must awaken.

833
01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:34.205
They will call me,

834
01:18:34.206 --> 01:18:36.134
Muad'Dib.

835
01:18:43.081 --> 01:18:47.093
Listen to me. Listen!

836
01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:50.154
You wanted to know
about my dreams.

837
01:18:50.665 --> 01:18:53.685
Well, I've just had
a waking dream.

838
01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.030
Do you know why?
The spice!

839
01:18:58.206 --> 01:19:00.602
It's in everything here.

840
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.372
Calm yourself.

841
01:19:02.373 --> 01:19:04.874
Like the Truthsayer drug.

842
01:19:06.165 --> 01:19:07.779
It's a poison.

843
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.997
You knew the spice
would change me.

844
01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.622
But thanks to your teachings,

845
01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:16.039
it's changing my consciousness.

846
01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:19.372
I see it!
l can see it!

847
01:19:19.623 --> 01:19:21.394
Is he the one?

848
01:19:22.665 --> 01:19:25.289
You carry my unborn sister
in your womb.

849
01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:26.904
He knows.

850
01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:39.539
Father!

851
01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.455
Father, I promise,

852
01:19:46.456 --> 01:19:49.947
one day
the sleeper will awaken.

853
01:19:50.206 --> 01:19:53.227
And I will avenge your death.

854
01:19:53.373 --> 01:19:56.164
I will not stop until I destroy

855
01:19:56.165 --> 01:19:58.873
the Emperor and the Baron.

856
01:20:03.873 --> 01:20:05.382
Father.

857
01:20:20.915 --> 01:20:22.894
Go now.

858
01:20:24.748 --> 01:20:29.543
Take him to his desert to die.

859
01:20:30.665 --> 01:20:32.383
Go.

860
01:21:03.415 --> 01:21:06.853
Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.

861
01:21:17.831 --> 01:21:20.749
We have to get to
that mountain of rock.

862
01:21:21.873 --> 01:21:23.164
We have entered the time

863
01:21:23.165 --> 01:21:26.446
when all will turn against us
and seek our lives.

864
01:21:41.706 --> 01:21:44.206
It's further than l thought.

865
01:21:45.206 --> 01:21:47.289
A worm is sure to come.

866
01:21:49.373 --> 01:21:52.706
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

867
01:22:20.706 --> 01:22:23.997
Remember, walk without rhythm,

868
01:22:23.998 --> 01:22:25.821
and we won't attract a worm.

869
01:22:25.956 --> 01:22:27.988
It will go to the thumper.

870
01:22:29.706 --> 01:22:31.843
I'm ready.

871
01:23:12.873 --> 01:23:14.749
Faster!

872
01:23:16.248 --> 01:23:18.279
It's deafening!

873
01:24:32.373 --> 01:24:33.623
Ooh!

874
01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:37.572
The spice!

875
01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.705
Do you smell it?

876
01:24:40.706 --> 01:24:41.955
Yes!

877
01:24:49.123 --> 01:24:50.373
Paul!

878
01:25:18.998 --> 01:25:21.132
A thumper.

879
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:31.914
The worm! Spice!

880
01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:33.685
Is there a relationship?

881
01:25:47.373 --> 01:25:51.332
What's happened?
Why did it leave?

882
01:25:51.873 --> 01:25:55.519
Someone started
another thumper.

883
01:25:57.706 --> 01:25:59.530
We're not alone.

884
01:26:28.998 --> 01:26:30.872
Man-carved steps.

885
01:26:30.873 --> 01:26:32.540
Yes.

886
01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:48.330
Such stealth.

887
01:26:48.331 --> 01:26:50.039
I didn't hear them.

888
01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:53.539
Perhaps these are the
ones the Shadout Mapes told us of.

889
01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.623
I will take the boy-man.

890
01:26:55.956 --> 01:26:58.924
He shall have sanctuary
in my tribe.

891
01:27:07.956 --> 01:27:12.227
Get back!
She has the weirding way.

892
01:27:13.873 --> 01:27:15.592
Great Gods!

893
01:27:15.998 --> 01:27:18.966
If you can do this
to the strongest of us,

894
01:27:19.206 --> 01:27:23.217
you're worth 10 times
your weight of water.

895
01:27:25.415 --> 01:27:28.904
As the leader of my people,
l give you my bond.

896
01:27:29.206 --> 01:27:32.164
Teach us this weirding way,

897
01:27:32.165 --> 01:27:35.039
and you both
shall have sanctuary.

898
01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.830
Your water shall
mingle with our water.

899
01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:42.332
Then l will teach you
our way of battle.

900
01:27:46.331 --> 01:27:50.205
l give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

901
01:27:50.206 --> 01:27:52.655
It is the legend.

902
01:27:57.748 --> 01:28:01.445
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

903
01:28:02.206 --> 01:28:06.165
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

904
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:08.705
From my dreams.

905
01:28:09.248 --> 01:28:11.800
So beautiful.

906
01:28:12.248 --> 01:28:13.455
Come with me.

907
01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:16.061
I'll show you
an easier way down.

908
01:28:34.081 --> 01:28:36.737
You have strength.

909
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:39.122
You shall be known as Usul,

910
01:28:39.123 --> 01:28:42.497
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

911
01:28:42.498 --> 01:28:45.468
This is your secret name
in our troop.

912
01:28:45.665 --> 01:28:48.747
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

913
01:28:48.748 --> 01:28:51.614
which we will call you openly.

914
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.685
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

915
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:03.572
We call that one Muad'Dib.

916
01:29:04.290 --> 01:29:07.260
Could l be known
as Paul Muad'Dib?

917
01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:10.248
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

918
01:29:11.206 --> 01:29:15.112
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

919
01:29:15.206 --> 01:29:17.238
We welcome you.

920
01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:21.572
The dream unfolds.

921
01:29:41.915 --> 01:29:43.373
Moisture!

922
01:29:43.498 --> 01:29:44.957
Wind traps.

923
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.416
Huge ones.

924
01:29:57.915 --> 01:30:02.710
Water.
Millions of decaliters.

925
01:30:03.123 --> 01:30:04.830
A treasure.

926
01:30:04.831 --> 01:30:07.748
Greater than treasure, Usul.

927
01:30:07.873 --> 01:30:11.675
We have thousands
of such caches,

928
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:15.789
and only a few of us
know them all.

929
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:18.602
And when we have enough,

930
01:30:18.748 --> 01:30:22.863
we shall change
the face of Arrakis.

931
01:30:41.873 --> 01:30:44.477
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

932
01:30:47.331 --> 01:30:50.353
Tell me
of your home world, Usul.

933
01:31:23.498 --> 01:31:26.988
Arrakis!

934
01:31:27.498 --> 01:31:30.519
Rabban! Rabban!

935
01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:34.747
We're knee-deep
in Atreides blood!

936
01:31:34.748 --> 01:31:38.810
We've gutted them!
We've gutted them!

937
01:31:42.456 --> 01:31:45.842
Rabban! Rabban!

938
01:31:46.373 --> 01:31:49.330
I place you
in charge of Arrakis.

939
01:31:49.331 --> 01:31:52.289
It's yours to squeeze,
as l promised.

940
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:57.085
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

941
01:31:57.206 --> 01:32:00.122
Give me spice!
Drive them!

942
01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:02.580
Drive them
into utter submission!

943
01:32:02.581 --> 01:32:05.789
Do not show
the slightest pity or mercy!

944
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:08.622
Never stop! Go! Go!

945
01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.872
Show no mercy!

946
01:32:09.873 --> 01:32:11.332
Yes, Baron!

947
01:32:31.998 --> 01:32:33.248
Feyd.

948
01:32:43.331 --> 01:32:48.126
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

949
01:32:48.748 --> 01:32:53.488
I'll send you. Feyd.

950
01:32:57.206 --> 01:32:59.187
Lovely Feyd.

951
01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:08.248
Where's my doctor?

952
01:33:14.331 --> 01:33:16.414
Jessica,

953
01:33:17.831 --> 01:33:20.436
our Reverend Mother is too old.

954
01:33:21.206 --> 01:33:23.580
She has been calling
through space and time,

955
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:26.290
for you to come
and let her rest.

956
01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:30.768
She asks that you pass within,

957
01:33:30.915 --> 01:33:33.518
and become our Reverend Mother.

958
01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:39.336
if you be a Reverend Mother,

959
01:33:40.873 --> 01:33:45.561
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

960
01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:50.937
The Water of Life.

961
01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.166
But what of my unborn child?

962
01:33:58.123 --> 01:34:01.977
One day,
l will have to do this.

963
01:34:18.248 --> 01:34:20.372
Following
the Bene Gesserit tradition,

964
01:34:20.373 --> 01:34:23.039
the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life

965
01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:25.747
as she surrendered
her knowledge.

966
01:34:26.706 --> 01:34:31.501
Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.

967
01:34:31.873 --> 01:34:35.727
Every man
who has tried has died.

968
01:34:36.206 --> 01:34:38.446
Am l the one?

969
01:34:38.748 --> 01:34:42.239
The sleeper must awaken.

970
01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.080
The tremendous
power of the Water of Life

971
01:34:48.081 --> 01:34:52.414
caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.

972
01:34:52.415 --> 01:34:54.414
Alia was born
with all the knowledge

973
01:34:54.415 --> 01:34:56.916
and powers of
a Reverend Mother.

974
01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:15.539
Feyd, even
though he's aging,

975
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:19.706
Thufir is one of the finest
Mentats in the Universe.

976
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:24.478
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

977
01:35:27.206 --> 01:35:28.289
Try it now.

978
01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:29.372
I will.

979
01:35:29.373 --> 01:35:30.623
Come.

980
01:35:44.206 --> 01:35:46.342
Oh, Thufir!

981
01:35:46.706 --> 01:35:50.248
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

982
01:35:51.081 --> 01:35:54.103
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

983
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.936
But this is not why we're here.

984
01:35:57.873 --> 01:36:01.155
We've brought you
a little cat, Thufir.

985
01:36:01.873 --> 01:36:04.581
You must care for it
if you wish to live.

986
01:36:05.581 --> 01:36:10.372
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

987
01:36:10.373 --> 01:36:14.039
By milking this, this smooth,
little cat body,

988
01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.372
you receive your antidote.

989
01:36:16.373 --> 01:36:18.874
It must be done each day.

990
01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:26.335
All l can see is an Atreides
that l want to kill.

991
01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:30.841
Feyd, no, no.

992
01:36:31.373 --> 01:36:34.289
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

993
01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:36.789
Aren't you, Thufir?

994
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:41.585
My Duke, how I've failed you.

995
01:36:58.873 --> 01:37:01.269
Chani, l love you.

996
01:37:02.873 --> 01:37:04.749
I've always loved you.

997
01:37:29.748 --> 01:37:32.613
The Holy Warriors.

998
01:37:33.123 --> 01:37:36.195
No one ever dreamed
there were so many.

999
01:37:37.206 --> 01:37:42.002
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1000
01:37:45.456 --> 01:37:48.164
Our shared enemy,
the Harkonnens,

1001
01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.039
Stilgar, your leader,

1002
01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:56.122
has asked me and my mother
to teach you

1003
01:37:56.123 --> 01:37:59.092
the weirding way
to crush the Harkonnens.

1004
01:38:00.248 --> 01:38:02.645
We must do more than this.

1005
01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:07.675
We must totally destroy all
spice production on Arrakis.

1006
01:38:08.331 --> 01:38:12.811
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1007
01:38:13.373 --> 01:38:17.123
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1008
01:38:17.706 --> 01:38:21.196
I will take 100 of your
warriors and train them.

1009
01:38:21.206 --> 01:38:24.539
This 100 will train
the thousands that remain.

1010
01:38:24.915 --> 01:38:27.455
When the spice flow stops,

1011
01:38:27.456 --> 01:38:30.705
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1012
01:38:30.706 --> 01:38:32.747
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1013
01:38:32.748 --> 01:38:35.040
will be forced to deal with us.

1014
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:42.585
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1015
01:38:44.623 --> 01:38:45.977
Orato!

1016
01:38:49.706 --> 01:38:54.134
This obelisk is of
your hardest stone.

1017
01:38:55.206 --> 01:38:56.456
Kick it.

1018
01:39:03.123 --> 01:39:04.373
Hit it.

1019
01:39:09.665 --> 01:39:10.915
Yell at it.

1020
01:39:16.540 --> 01:39:18.309
Break!

1021
01:39:20.206 --> 01:39:23.436
Korba, cut it.

1022
01:39:36.165 --> 01:39:37.415
Move back.

1023
01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:08.414
This is part
of the weirding way

1024
01:40:08.415 --> 01:40:10.341
that we will teach you.

1025
01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:16.916
Some thoughts
have a certain sound,

1026
01:40:16.956 --> 01:40:19.769
that being
the equivalent to a form.

1027
01:40:19.831 --> 01:40:22.372
Through sound and motion,

1028
01:40:22.373 --> 01:40:26.914
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1029
01:40:26.915 --> 01:40:31.710
set fires, suffocate an
enemy, or burst his organs.

1030
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:32.955
We will kill

1031
01:40:32.956 --> 01:40:36.080
until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1032
01:40:36.081 --> 01:40:39.102
Muad'Dib!

1033
01:40:40.456 --> 01:40:44.311
Chaaksa.

1034
01:40:48.998 --> 01:40:50.508
Stilgar.

1035
01:40:52.915 --> 01:40:54.205
Muad'Dib.

1036
01:40:54.206 --> 01:40:55.289
Hmm?

1037
01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:58.987
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1038
01:41:02.623 --> 01:41:05.645
My name is a killing word.

1039
01:41:06.123 --> 01:41:07.789
They are ready to fight.

1040
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:09.497
Yet in order to lead them,

1041
01:41:09.498 --> 01:41:13.977
I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.

1042
01:41:22.706 --> 01:41:26.143
Take the kiswa maker hook
of our sietch,

1043
01:41:26.206 --> 01:41:29.018
and ride as a leader of men.

1044
01:41:44.415 --> 01:41:47.697
Shai-Hulud.

1045
01:42:27.206 --> 01:42:31.581
l must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.

1046
01:42:39.206 --> 01:42:42.664
Only the very strong ones
travel this deep.

1047
01:42:42.665 --> 01:42:45.705
Usul has called a big one!

1048
01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:49.040
Again, it is the legend.

1049
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.727
Muad'Dib!

1050
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.039
Usul, these are 1
5 of our finest warriors

1051
01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.894
to serve you as your guard.

1052
01:45:13.081 --> 01:45:14.904
The Fedaykin.

1053
01:45:28.498 --> 01:45:29.747
Now.

1054
01:45:55.748 --> 01:46:00.039
When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1055
01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:01.872
The Baron
and the Emperor himself

1056
01:46:01.873 --> 01:46:03.904
will be forced to deal with us.

1057
01:46:07.498 --> 01:46:10.080
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.

1058
01:46:10.081 --> 01:46:12.039
Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.

1059
01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.747
What happened?
Muad'Dib.

1060
01:46:13.748 --> 01:46:15.705
What happened to you
and your men?

1061
01:46:15.706 --> 01:46:17.080
Muad'Dib!

1062
01:46:17.081 --> 01:46:18.872
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

1063
01:46:18.873 --> 01:46:22.779
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1064
01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.622
He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.

1065
01:46:27.623 --> 01:46:32.419
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1066
01:46:38.248 --> 01:46:41.205
In the two
standard years that followed,

1067
01:46:41.206 --> 01:46:42.664
Muad'Dib and the Fremen

1068
01:46:42.665 --> 01:46:46.080
brought spice production
to a standstill.

1069
01:46:46.081 --> 01:46:48.830
Fearing for his life,
Rabban did his best

1070
01:46:48.831 --> 01:46:52.893
to hide this fact
from his uncle, the Baron.

1071
01:46:58.873 --> 01:47:02.497
Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.

1072
01:47:02.498 --> 01:47:06.300
Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.

1073
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.821
Paul and Chant's love grew.

1074
01:47:14.665 --> 01:47:16.372
We surprised
a band of smugglers.

1075
01:47:16.373 --> 01:47:19.081
Too bad. l thought
they were Harkonnen.

1076
01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.498
Gurney!

1077
01:47:35.706 --> 01:47:39.143
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleek.

1078
01:47:39.206 --> 01:47:40.456
Paul.

1079
01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:43.414
Paul!

1080
01:47:43.415 --> 01:47:45.205
Don't you trust your own eyes?

1081
01:47:45.206 --> 01:47:47.343
They said you were dead.

1082
01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.790
They...

1083
01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:52.747
They said...

1084
01:47:58.206 --> 01:48:00.330
Gurney! Gurney! Gurney!
You young pup!

1085
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:01.372
Gurney!

1086
01:48:01.373 --> 01:48:02.622
You young pup!

1087
01:48:19.623 --> 01:48:21.830
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1088
01:48:21.831 --> 01:48:23.789
you have one last chance

1089
01:48:23.790 --> 01:48:25.872
to take matters
into your own hands,

1090
01:48:25.873 --> 01:48:29.289
and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.

1091
01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:30.580
What do you mean,
one last...

1092
01:48:30.581 --> 01:48:31.872
Silence. Do not speak.

1093
01:48:31.873 --> 01:48:36.039
Listen. You do not have more
than this one chance.

1094
01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.270
I represent the entire Guild
in this matter.

1095
01:48:39.373 --> 01:48:40.705
Our navigators warn you

1096
01:48:40.706 --> 01:48:43.330
that spice production
is in great danger.

1097
01:48:43.331 --> 01:48:45.414
A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,

1098
01:48:45.415 --> 01:48:48.039
has stopped spice mining
on Arrakis.

1099
01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.414
Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.

1100
01:48:51.415 --> 01:48:54.455
No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.

1101
01:48:54.456 --> 01:48:56.747
We do not know who he is.

1102
01:48:56.748 --> 01:48:59.405
The Harkonnens cannot stop him.

1103
01:48:59.831 --> 01:49:03.372
Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,

1104
01:49:03.373 --> 01:49:07.123
or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.

1105
01:49:14.373 --> 01:49:15.914
The Emperor will stop him.

1106
01:49:15.915 --> 01:49:18.363
He won't take
the Water of Life.

1107
01:49:18.706 --> 01:49:20.955
That's why
they want me killed.

1108
01:49:20.956 --> 01:49:23.977
They're afraid
I'll take the Water of Life.

1109
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.372
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

1110
01:49:28.373 --> 01:49:30.080
50 legions?

1111
01:49:30.081 --> 01:49:31.789
That's our entire
reserves as well.

1112
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:33.122
This is genocide,

1113
01:49:33.123 --> 01:49:35.247
the deliberate
and systematic destruction

1114
01:49:35.248 --> 01:49:38.165
of all life on Arrakis!

1115
01:49:39.165 --> 01:49:43.540
The Emperor is coming!
Chani! Chani!

1116
01:49:45.206 --> 01:49:50.001
You were calling my name.
it frightened me.

1117
01:49:50.165 --> 01:49:51.622
Oh, Chani.

1118
01:49:52.665 --> 01:49:55.425
All the images
of my future are gone.

1119
01:49:57.456 --> 01:50:00.122
I have to drink
the Water of Life.

1120
01:50:00.123 --> 01:50:02.997
No, Paul, please.

1121
01:50:02.998 --> 01:50:04.872
I've seen the men
who have tried.

1122
01:50:04.873 --> 01:50:06.705
I've seen how they died.

1123
01:50:06.706 --> 01:50:11.499
I'm dead to everyone unless
l try to become what l may be.

1124
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.665
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1125
01:50:22.706 --> 01:50:25.155
l must drink the sacred water.

1126
01:50:27.956 --> 01:50:29.937
I must go now.

1127
01:51:24.415 --> 01:51:28.529
Hurry. All l see
is darkness.

1128
01:51:28.706 --> 01:51:29.956
Paul.

1129
01:51:32.456 --> 01:51:37.252
I will love you forever.
You are my life.

1130
01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.654
You are my life.

1131
01:51:54.915 --> 01:51:57.466
Many men have tried.

1132
01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:59.705
They tried and failed?

1133
01:51:59.706 --> 01:52:01.790
They tried and died.

1134
01:52:10.081 --> 01:52:12.039
The worm is the spice.

1135
01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:14.435
The spice is the worm.

1136
01:52:34.123 --> 01:52:36.726
The worms.

1137
01:52:52.831 --> 01:52:55.748
They're not attacking.
Why?

1138
01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.498
Alia.

1139
01:53:16.873 --> 01:53:18.279
Mother.

1140
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:22.331
It's Paul.

1141
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:27.831
He's taken the Water of Life.

1142
01:53:37.206 --> 01:53:42.002
There is a
place, terrifying to us,

1143
01:53:42.331 --> 01:53:43.634
to women.

1144
01:53:43.706 --> 01:53:47.041
This is the place
they cannot look.

1145
01:53:53.373 --> 01:53:57.175
Traveling without moving.

1146
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.269
Now I truly control the worm

1147
01:54:01.873 --> 01:54:04.114
and the spice.

1148
01:54:04.873 --> 01:54:09.668
And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!

1149
01:54:39.415 --> 01:54:43.529
Paul.

1150
01:54:52.623 --> 01:54:54.624
Father!

1151
01:54:59.081 --> 01:55:02.780
The sleeper has awakened!

1152
01:55:10.665 --> 01:55:13.165
Muad'Dib.

1153
01:55:20.456 --> 01:55:24.936
Arrakis, Dune,

1154
01:55:26.081 --> 01:55:27.644
Desert Planet.

1155
01:55:29.081 --> 01:55:31.582
Your time has come.

1156
01:55:31.873 --> 01:55:34.164
A storm is coming.

1157
01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:36.414
Our storm.

1158
01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:41.654
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1159
01:55:43.373 --> 01:55:47.904
Emperor, we come for you!

1160
01:55:48.998 --> 01:55:51.081
We come for you!

1161
01:56:05.331 --> 01:56:08.205
Long live the fighters!

1162
01:56:08.206 --> 01:56:12.268
Long live the fighters!

1163
01:56:42.748 --> 01:56:44.372
Suspicion confirmed.

1164
01:56:44.373 --> 01:56:46.874
The Emperor's
had Rabban seized.

1165
01:57:29.373 --> 01:57:32.864
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1166
01:57:33.373 --> 01:57:37.019
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1167
01:57:37.873 --> 01:57:41.363
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1168
01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:45.330
Usul, we have wormsign,

1169
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:48.508
the likes of which
even God has never seen.

1170
01:58:44.206 --> 01:58:49.001
Bring in that
floating fat man, the Baron.

1171
01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:06.539
Why have you brought me here?

1172
01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:10.664
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1173
01:59:10.665 --> 01:59:12.539
I never requested
your presence.

1174
01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:13.790
Ah.

1175
01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:16.455
But your lack of action
demanded it.

1176
01:59:16.456 --> 01:59:18.914
Your dreadful mismanagement,
your bad judgment

1177
01:59:18.915 --> 01:59:22.414
in assigning to Rabban
the governorship.

1178
01:59:22.415 --> 01:59:23.705
You've forced me to come here

1179
01:59:23.706 --> 01:59:26.936
and set things straight,
personally.

1180
01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:41.122
l am a messenger
from Muad'Dib.

1181
01:59:41.123 --> 01:59:43.364
Poor Emperor.

1182
01:59:43.415 --> 01:59:47.289
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1183
01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:48.697
Silence!

1184
01:59:48.706 --> 01:59:50.914
Kill this child.
She's an abomination.

1185
01:59:50.915 --> 01:59:53.122
Kill her. Kill her.

1186
01:59:53.123 --> 01:59:56.080
Get out of my mind!

1187
01:59:56.081 --> 01:59:58.789
Not until you tell them both

1188
01:59:58.790 --> 02:00:02.592
who l really am.

1189
02:00:03.415 --> 02:00:05.028
Alia,

1190
02:00:06.873 --> 02:00:10.330
daughter of Duke Leto the Just,

1191
02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:14.039
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1192
02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.550
Sister

1193
02:00:16.165 --> 02:00:20.039
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1194
02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:24.779
Paul's sister?
Paul is Muad'Dib?

1195
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:31.184
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1196
02:00:35.748 --> 02:00:39.289
With the storm, their
air power will be useless.

1197
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:42.539
On Arrakis, it's desert power.

1198
02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:43.789
Gurney.

1199
02:00:45.331 --> 02:00:46.414
Now!

1200
02:00:46.415 --> 02:00:47.821
Atomics!

1201
02:01:23.081 --> 02:01:27.876
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1202
02:01:29.748 --> 02:01:31.122
Lmpossible!

1203
02:01:31.123 --> 02:01:33.205
Not impossible.

1204
02:01:33.206 --> 02:01:37.321
I told you.
He is here now.

1205
02:01:43.415 --> 02:01:47.372
Father, today
I will avenge your death.

1206
02:02:10.248 --> 02:02:13.497
Emperor, an
impassable storm has descended.

1207
02:02:13.498 --> 02:02:17.352
The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.

1208
02:02:18.331 --> 02:02:19.999
Release the Sardaukar.

1209
02:02:20.123 --> 02:02:24.918
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1210
02:02:25.623 --> 02:02:28.852
Wait for my brother, Baron.

1211
02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:16.947
Chaa!

1212
02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:13.290
Cha.

1213
02:04:15.498 --> 02:04:17.477
Wait for my brother.

1214
02:04:23.623 --> 02:04:27.164
Cha!

1215
02:04:30.831 --> 02:04:33.488
Muad'Dib!

1216
02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:19.001
Eee-sah!

1217
02:05:22.998 --> 02:05:24.248
Cha!

1218
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:30.330
Alia, now.

1219
02:05:30.331 --> 02:05:32.467
Come to me, Baron.

1220
02:06:46.206 --> 02:06:48.290
Muad'Dib!

1221
02:07:32.873 --> 02:07:34.872
Feyd Rautha.

1222
02:07:34.873 --> 02:07:37.622
Emperor Shaddam lV,

1223
02:07:37.623 --> 02:07:39.580
there are Guild Heighliners
above us,

1224
02:07:39.581 --> 02:07:42.247
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1225
02:07:42.248 --> 02:07:43.705
Send them back.

1226
02:07:43.706 --> 02:07:45.705
How dare
you speak to me in...

1227
02:07:45.706 --> 02:07:48.050
Stop your speaking.

1228
02:07:49.706 --> 02:07:52.259
You have some idea
of what l could do.

1229
02:07:54.915 --> 02:07:58.509
Don't try your powers on me.

1230
02:07:58.915 --> 02:08:01.289
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1231
02:08:01.290 --> 02:08:03.372
You'll find me there
staring back at you.

1232
02:08:03.373 --> 02:08:04.955
You mustn't speak...

1233
02:08:04.956 --> 02:08:06.414
Silence!

1234
02:08:09.498 --> 02:08:11.790
l remember your gom jabbar.

1235
02:08:12.456 --> 02:08:14.247
Now you'll remember mine.

1236
02:08:14.248 --> 02:08:16.488
I can kill with a word.

1237
02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:21.830
And his word shall carry
death eternal

1238
02:08:21.831 --> 02:08:24.039
to those who stand
against the righteous.

1239
02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:25.539
The righteous?

1240
02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:27.988
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1241
02:08:30.248 --> 02:08:34.247
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1242
02:08:34.248 --> 02:08:35.455
If Feyd wishes,

1243
02:08:35.456 --> 02:08:37.872
he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1244
02:08:37.873 --> 02:08:39.205
I wish it.

1245
02:08:39.206 --> 02:08:41.706
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1246
02:08:42.165 --> 02:08:44.955
Let me. Please, my lord.

1247
02:08:44.956 --> 02:08:47.352
The Emperor's blade.

1248
02:09:17.373 --> 02:09:20.810
Why prolong the inevitable?

1249
02:09:22.665 --> 02:09:24.383
l will kill you.

1250
02:09:39.831 --> 02:09:41.759
l will kill him!

1251
02:09:48.373 --> 02:09:49.623
Paul!

1252
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:53.082
I will kill him!

1253
02:10:02.206 --> 02:10:06.737
Who is the little one?
A pet, perhaps?

1254
02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.581
Will she deserve
my special attentions?

1255
02:10:17.123 --> 02:10:18.530
Poisoned.

1256
02:10:21.456 --> 02:10:24.999
You see your death.

1257
02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.123
My blade will finish you.

1258
02:10:29.248 --> 02:10:33.363
I will bend like
a reed in the wind.

1259
02:10:47.748 --> 02:10:48.998
Chaaksa!

1260
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:58.717
Muad'Dib.

1261
02:10:59.165 --> 02:11:01.822
Usul no longer needs
the weirding module.

1262
02:11:02.665 --> 02:11:06.247
Muad'Dib
had become the hand of God,

1263
02:11:06.248 --> 02:11:09.009
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.

1264
02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:10.205
Where there was war,

1265
02:11:10.206 --> 02:11:12.955
Muad'Dib would now bring peace.

1266
02:11:12.956 --> 02:11:16.830
Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love,

1267
02:11:16.831 --> 02:11:19.749
to lead the people
to true freedom,

1268
02:11:19.956 --> 02:11:23.811
and to change
the face of Arrakis.

1269
02:11:26.540 --> 02:11:28.936
We Fremen have a saying.

1270
02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:33.290
God created Arrakis
to train the faithful.

1271
02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:37.321
One cannot go
against the word of God.

1272
02:12:34.373 --> 02:12:36.821
And how can this be?

1273
02:12:38.873 --> 02:12:43.144
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach.
