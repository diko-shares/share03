you stay there, understand?

You bet!

192
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,696
You know, in my line of work...

193

195

Texas, huh?

205
00:27:15,818 --> 00:27:17,985
How much for the ferry ride?

206
00:27:18,195 --> 00:27:19,862
Ten cents.

207
00:27:20,364 --> 00:27:24,826
By coincidence, I happen to have
a bottle of this remarkable elixir...

208
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:26,994

Mister...?

216
00:27:45,848 --> 00:27:48,182
Figured we'd give you some
ferrying business.

217
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:50,852
With pleasure!

218
00:27:51,645 --> 00:27:55,857
Bill Quantrill used this ferry
all the time.

219
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:57,900
Good friend of mine.

220
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:00,194
What have you got there?

221
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:04,657
Just the store with
Grannie Hawkins up there.

222
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,743
I'll tell you what.

223
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:10,788
We'll all just amble
over to that store.

224
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,791
Him and me will ride.
We've got a touch of the cramp.

225
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,376
CARPETBAGGER: Stranger, you're in luck!

226
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:18,588
I just happen to have the perfect thing
here for cramps.

227
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,550
We'll need half a side of bacon...

228
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:26,554
...10 pounds of beef jerky,
20 pounds of horse grain.

229
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:30,558
And when we get over there, there won't
be any need for you to go inside.

230
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:34,729
Just tell Old Grannie through the door
we'll need a lot of clean bandages...

231
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:39,108
...and a boiled poultice for a
bullet wound in a hurry. Come on.

232
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:56,459
So you'll be Josey Wales.

233
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,838
How might you know that, Grannie?

234
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:03,591
Soldiers were here looking
for you two hours ago.

235
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:08,429
I was going to mention that to you
as soon as I got the chance.

236
00:29:08,722 --> 00:29:10,431
They say you killed your own men.

237
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:12,850
Those lying blue scumbellies!

238
00:29:13,101 --> 00:29:16,145
GRANNIE: They say you're a hard-put
and desperate man.

239
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:20,107
They're going to heel and hog you
to a barn door.

240
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,779
- You know what I say?
- What's that?

241
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:27,782
I say that big talk's worth diddlysquat.

242
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:32,119
Now them poultices be laced with
feather moss and mustard root.

243
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,957
Mind you drop water on them
occasionally and keep them damp.

244
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,000
Much obliged, Grannie.

245
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:41,504
You can pay me when you see me again,
Josey Wales.

246
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,967

...wouldn't you say so, Mr. Wales?

252
00:30:08,156 --> 00:30:10,157
Your young friend can use some help.

253
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:12,159
This is it. One dollar a bottle.

254
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:14,537
It works wonders on wounds.

255
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,831
Works wonders on
just about everything.

256
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,166
It can do most anything.

257
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:22,878

What others?

287

They'd catch up to us

Judging by these tracks,
there's maybe...

...40, 50 horses ahead of us.

297

It's him, Abe. It's him.

355
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,592
We got the Josey Wales, Abe!

356
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:29,430
I seen him ride side by side
with Bloody Bill.

357
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:31,432
We got reward money coming.

358
00:37:32,517 --> 00:37:36,103
Watch it. He's meaner than
a rattler and twice as fast!

359
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:39,732
You're a real bush hog,
ain't you, Mr. Josey Wales?

360
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:40,941
Tell you what.

361
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,944
Move on back. Move on back!

362
00:37:44,154 --> 00:37:46,280
LIGE: Watch him.
I seen him do some things.

363
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,948
Shut up, Lige!

364
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,122
Now...

365
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,833
...Mr. Josey Wales...

366
00:37:58,293 --> 00:37:59,877
...I'd just as soon shoot you now...

367
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:03,964
...except it'd be hard to drag your body
to where we can get our price for you.

368
00:38:04,257 --> 00:38:07,134
- Shoot him now!
- Shut up, Lige.

369
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,306
Move your left hand down
and unbuckle that pistol belt.

370
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:15,559
Make it nice and slow...

371
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,312
...so I can count the hairs
on that hand.

372
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,002
See, Lige?

373
00:38:43,671 --> 00:38:45,506
You pull his teeth...

374
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,801
...he's harmless as a heel hound.

375
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:54,723
Always wanted to face out one of these
pistol fighters they all fuss about.

376
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,309
Only way you handle them.

377
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,520
Abe, watch out.

378
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:02,689
- He's probably got another pistol...
- Shut up, Lige.

379
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,026
Call Benny back there on the horse.

380
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:08,695
Benny! Come out!

381
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:11,240
We got us the Josey Wales!

Oh, brown rosie

383
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:16,370
Rose of Alabamy

384
00:39:16,538 --> 00:39:17,955
Who is that?

385
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,750
He's just a boy. He's got a fever.

386
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,044
Tell him to shut up.

387
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:27,047
Sweet tobacco posies...

388
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:30,425
Pa?

389
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,885
Is that you, Pa?

390
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,556
It ain't your pa! Now shut up!

391
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,391
Pa.

392
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,601
I got the gold right here, Pa.

393
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,729
What gold is he talking about?

394
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,232
There's no gold. He's crazy.

395
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,776
The gold me and Josey robbed
from the bank.

396
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,116
Lige, take a look under that blanket.

397
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,744
I got it right here.

398
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,932
Thought you could use some help.

399
00:40:20,143 --> 00:40:24,605
You get those holes leaking, I'm going
to whomp you with a knotted plow-line.

400
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,982
They ain't honest.

401
00:40:27,317 --> 00:40:29,943
I feel as pert as a rutting buck.

402
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:32,446
Good.

403
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,491
Because I ain't hauling you
all over hell's creation...

404
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:39,119
...dribbling blood over
half of Missouri.

405
00:40:41,122 --> 00:40:43,290
JAMIE: Wish we had time
to bury them fellows.

406
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,210
To hell with them fellows.

407
00:40:48,463 --> 00:40:51,632

JOSEY: A real frog strangler.

410
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:22,204
Ten, 20 more miles and we'll be
safe in the Nations.

411
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:33,674
Some cavalry between us
and the Nations.

412
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:36,260
We'll have to wait till they bed down...

413
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,095
...then walk through quiet.

414
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,681
Here, have some beef jerky.

415
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:44,559
Don't swallow nothing but the juice.
I'll go have a look-see.

416
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:46,270
You feel all right?

417
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:49,731
I feel real good, Josey.
We got them whupped.

418
00:41:52,527 --> 00:41:55,904
- Josey, I want to thank you.
- For what?

419
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,198
For saving my life.

420
00:41:59,534 --> 00:42:01,285
Forget about that, Jamie.

421
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,370
You know something, Josey?

422
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:06,415
I ain't scared no more.

423
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:13,130
All right.

424
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,952
We can start working our way
through now, boy.

425
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:46,413
This rain is giving us the...

426
00:43:11,439 --> 00:43:13,315
This boy was brought up in...

427
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,610
...a time of blood and dying,
and never questioned a bit of it.

428
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:20,489
Never turned his back
on his folks or his kind.

429
00:43:22,575 --> 00:43:25,786
I rode with him, I got no complaints.

430
00:43:26,454 --> 00:43:30,957
The bluebellies will give you
a better burial than I can, boy.

431
00:43:40,468 --> 00:43:42,010
MAN: Halt!

432
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,971
- What's going on?
- Come on, get him.

433
00:45:17,732 --> 00:45:20,901
JOSEY: Howdy.
- Howdy.

434
00:45:21,736 --> 00:45:23,737
Name's Josey Wales.

435
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:26,907
I've heard of that name.

436
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:31,077
Some said you'd be headed this way.

437
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:36,750
And they said a man could get rich
on reward money...

438
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:38,460
...if he could kill you.

439
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,422
Seems like you was looking
to gain some money here.

440
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,218
Actually, I was looking
to gain an edge.

441
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:51,097
I thought you might be someone who
would sneak up behind me with a gun.

442
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:53,934
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?

443
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:57,270
It ain't supposed to be easy
to sneak up behind an Indian.

444
00:45:58,648 --> 00:46:00,941
I'm an Indian, all right.

445
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:05,445
But here in the Nation,
they call us the civilized tribe.

446
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:10,951
They call us civilized because
we're easy to sneak up on.

447
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:16,456
White men have been sneaking up
on us for years.

448
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,125
Cherokee, huh?

449
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,503
Yeah.

450
00:46:21,963 --> 00:46:26,841
They sneaked up on us and they
told us we wouldn't be happy here.

451
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,512
They said we would be happier
in the Nations.

452
00:46:31,264 --> 00:46:34,182
So they took away our land...

453
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,309
...and sent us here.

454
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:40,772
I have a fine woman...

455
00:46:41,816 --> 00:46:43,650
...and two sons.

456
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:47,195
But they all died on the Trail of Tears.

457
00:46:49,699 --> 00:46:54,369
And now the white man
is sneaking up on me.

458
00:46:56,205 --> 00:46:57,831
Again.

459
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:06,047
Seems like we can't trust
the white man.

460
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,592
You bet we can't.

461
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:12,804
I wore this...

462
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:16,349
...frock coat in Washington.

463
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:18,059
Before the war.

464
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,730
We wore them because we belonged to...

465
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:24,190
...the five civilized tribes.

466
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:29,738
We dressed ourselves up
like Abraham Lincoln.

467
00:47:33,576 --> 00:47:38,371
We got to see the
Secretary of the Interior.

468
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:40,957
And he said:

469
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:44,753
"Boy! You boys sure look civilized!"

470
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,465
He congratulated us...

471
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:52,594
...and he gave us medals
for looking so civilized.

472
00:47:52,887 --> 00:47:56,556
We told him about how
our land had been stolen...

473
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:59,100
...and our people were dying.

474
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,480
When we finished,
he shook our hands...

475
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:05,065
...and said:

476
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,943
"Endeavor to persevere."

477
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,404
They stood us in a line.

478
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:14,741
John Jumper, Chilly McIntosh...

479
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:17,243
...Buffalo Hump...

480
00:48:18,788 --> 00:48:21,164
...and Jim Pock Mark and me.

481
00:48:21,415 --> 00:48:22,666
I'm Lone Watie.

482
00:48:23,084 --> 00:48:25,085
They took our pictures.

483
00:48:25,628 --> 00:48:27,921
And the newspaper said:

484
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:33,093
"Indians Vow to Endeavor to Persevere."

485
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:36,262
We thought about it for a long time.

486
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:39,391
"Endeavor to persevere."

487
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:43,812
And when we had thought
about it long enough...

488
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:47,023
...we declared war on the Union.

Sergeant said this kid tried to ride
through their camp. They got him.

491
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:09,003
- They did, did they?
- Mm-hm.

492
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:12,132
They've had men on guard here
night and day.

493
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,551
No way Wales could get to the Nations.

494
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:22,058
Where are you going, Fletcher?

495
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:24,811
I'm heading into the Indian Nations.

496
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:27,313
Why don't you stay here, Redlegs?

497
00:49:27,982 --> 00:49:30,442
Wales may be back in a year or two.

498
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:36,865
When we get to the Nations,
I want you men to fan out.

499
00:49:37,158 --> 00:49:39,743
Five thousand dollars
to the one who gets him.

500
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:02,849
A horned toad can tell you
which way to go.

501
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,728
I used to know these things
when I was young.

502
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:10,857
But when I got civilized,
I forgot all these things.

503
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:13,026
I didn't know which way to go.

504
00:50:13,402 --> 00:50:16,571
The horned toad says
we should go to Mexico.

505
00:50:24,205 --> 00:50:26,581
Well, Mr. Lone Watie...

506
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,878
...you can take your horned toad
down Mexico way.

507
00:50:32,588 --> 00:50:35,215
I've got some unfinished
business in Missouri.

508
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:38,384
I heard General Joe Shelby...

509
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:41,554
...and some men refused to surrender.

510
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:43,431
They're going down to Mexico.

511
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:45,058
I think I'll join them.

512
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:47,143
Shelby, huh?

513
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:49,395
I didn't know others
hadn't surrendered.

514
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:51,606
I didn't surrender, neither.

515
00:50:51,899 --> 00:50:55,568
But they took my horse
and made him surrender.

516
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,072
They have him pulling a wagon
up in Kansas, I'll bet.

517
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,910
You haven't got a horse.

518

What do you plan on doing,
walking to Mexico?

00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:09,791
No, there's a trading post
right near the Creek Nation.

00:51:10,042 --> 00:51:11,960
They got horses to trade.

521
00:51:13,587 --> 00:51:15,171
You have any food here?

522
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:19,968
All I have is a piece of hard rock candy.

523
00:51:21,428 --> 00:51:23,096
But it's not for eating.

524
00:51:23,305 --> 00:51:25,598
It's just for looking through.

525
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,311
Alrighty.

526
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:36,442
I'll get you a horse.

527
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,217
What have you got there?

528
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,552

01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,919
Whenever I get to liking someone,
they ain't around long.

706
01:09:59,379 --> 01:10:04,091
I notice when you get to disliking someone
they ain't around long neither.

How did you know which one
was going to shoot first?

708
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,892
That one in the center
had a flap holster...

709
01:10:14,102 --> 01:10:16,228
...and he was in no itching hurry.

710
01:10:16,896 --> 01:10:18,730
And the one second from the left...

711
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,400
...had scared eyes.
He wasn't going to do nothing.

712
01:10:21,693 --> 01:10:23,485
But that one on the far left...

713
01:10:23,736 --> 01:10:27,280
...had crazy eyes.
Figured him to make the first move.

714
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:28,991
And the one on the right?

715
01:10:34,205 --> 01:10:36,081
Never paid no him no mind.

716
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,457

with a renegade Injun.

720

I can identify him.

721
01:10:53,725 --> 01:10:57,769
And I'd certainly be glad
to share in any reward.

722
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:01,148

Well, not a hard man to track.

01:11:06,946 --> 01:11:09,322
Leaves dead men wherever he goes.

725
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,284
He's heading north now...

726
01:11:12,785 --> 01:11:14,828
...riding with a renegade Indian.

727
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:18,623
He's heading north now,
but he'll turn southwest...

728
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:20,292
...head for Mexico.

729
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:23,378

all that way for that.

said it was a thriving place.

882
01:32:12,711 --> 01:32:14,253
TEN SPOT: It was.

883
01:32:14,546 --> 01:32:17,589
But when the silver run out,
the thriving run out.

884
01:32:17,882 --> 01:32:19,008
That's right.

885
01:32:19,217 --> 01:32:21,719
I do declare.

886
01:32:22,012 --> 01:32:23,887
Might you be the mother
of Tom Turner...

887
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:27,224
...whose Crooked River Ranch
is over by Blood Butte?

888
01:32:27,434 --> 01:32:30,894
- That I might, miss.
- Well!

889
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:33,522
I am Rose.

890
01:32:33,732 --> 01:32:35,399
Rose of Santo Rio.

891
01:32:35,608 --> 01:32:38,110
I reckon he wrote you all about me.

892
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:40,946
I don't recollect that.

893
01:32:41,239 --> 01:32:43,741
After his Lucy passed on...

894
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:45,909
...he didn't show much
interest in women.

895
01:32:46,953 --> 01:32:51,679
My sonny-boy kept his nose to the
grindstone, providing a future for me...

896
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:52,877
...and his daughter there.

897
01:32:56,775 --> 01:33:00,736
I do seem to recall him
telling me something about...

898
01:33:00,891 --> 01:33:03,851
...a daughter who was a little odd.

899
01:33:04,304 --> 01:33:08,849
He was killed in the Border War
by Missouri ruffians.

900
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,920
He died a proud member of
Senator Jim Lane's Redlegs...

901
01:33:13,697 --> 01:33:15,939
...fighting for the just cause!

902
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:18,359
I am sorry to hear that.

903
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:21,612
I mean, he was of the finest sort.

904
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:24,365
CHATO:
Señora, please sit down.

905
01:33:24,421 --> 01:33:27,089
You must be very, very tired.

906
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,671
I am deeply sorrowed to hear this.

907
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:34,625
In past years...

908
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:38,117
...my friend and I were of service
to your Tom Turner.

909
01:33:38,505 --> 01:33:40,798
And now we are at your service.

910
01:33:42,217 --> 01:33:45,844
Why, I appreciate your concern.

911
01:33:45,941 --> 01:33:49,277
I am glad to find manners at last,
here in the wilderness.

912
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:53,870
We have endured hardship of the
worst sort on the way out here.

913
01:33:55,016 --> 01:33:58,518
Grandpa Samuel and Uncle Enoch...

914
01:33:58,709 --> 01:34:01,378
...fell prey to Comancheros.

915
01:34:01,462 --> 01:34:05,805
Let's drink to the silver running out.
Gave us some peace and quiet here!

916
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:07,969
TRAVIS: Bad luck, the silver running out.

917
01:34:09,244 --> 01:34:11,161
TEN SPOT: I wouldn't have any other kind!

918
01:34:19,379 --> 01:34:20,421
What'll you have?

919
01:34:22,048 --> 01:34:24,133
I'm looking for Josey Wales.

920
01:34:27,387 --> 01:34:28,554
That'll be me.

921
01:34:32,434 --> 01:34:34,143
You're wanted, Wales.

922
01:34:34,519 --> 01:34:36,520
Reckon I'm right popular.

923
01:34:38,857 --> 01:34:40,274
You a bounty hunter?

924
01:34:40,692 --> 01:34:43,527
A man's got to do something
for a living these days.

925
01:34:44,571 --> 01:34:47,072
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.

926
01:34:51,035 --> 01:34:53,162
You know, this isn't necessary.

927
01:34:54,038 --> 01:34:56,039
You can just ride on.

928
01:35:13,725 --> 01:35:15,476
Whew.

929
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:35,287
I had to come back.

930
01:35:36,456 --> 01:35:37,706
I know.

931
01:36:19,749 --> 01:36:22,251
- Comanche?
- Comanches, all right.

932
01:36:23,002 --> 01:36:24,294
Any more of them?

933
01:36:24,504 --> 01:36:26,630
I think that's all there is...

934
01:36:26,965 --> 01:36:29,675
...but they have horses
packing antelope...

935
01:36:29,968 --> 01:36:32,344
...so I figure they're not
a raiding party.

936
01:36:32,845 --> 01:36:35,138
But you never can tell
these Comanches.

937
01:36:36,307 --> 01:36:37,808
You stay with the cart.

938
01:36:43,273 --> 01:36:45,148
(COMANCHES WHOOPING)

939
01:36:57,203 --> 01:36:59,329
Just looking us over, I guess.

940
01:36:59,831 --> 01:37:01,707
They're packing heavy.

941
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,083
They may return.

942
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:05,002
All right, let's move out.

943
01:37:12,552 --> 01:37:15,178
If they ride with Ten Bears...

944
01:37:15,388 --> 01:37:17,014
...they will come back.

945
01:37:17,932 --> 01:37:21,059
Ten Bears is the greatest
Comanche war chief.

946
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:22,686
But he's angry.

947
01:37:22,895 --> 01:37:26,315
Each year, he has met with
one of your bluecoat generals.

948
01:37:26,482 --> 01:37:27,733
JOSEY: Ain't one of my generals.

949
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,403
CHATO: And each year he is pushed
further across the plains.

950
01:37:31,696 --> 01:37:34,615
General Sherman has come
with more promises.

951
01:37:34,866 --> 01:37:37,367
But Ten Bears will move no more.

952
01:38:31,464 --> 01:38:33,965
It's so beautiful.

953
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:45,602
All right, we can get to work
dusting first.

954
01:38:46,145 --> 01:38:50,899
Got a nice Dutch oven
in the fireplace here.

955
01:38:51,109 --> 01:38:55,112
Mr. Wales, you men chop some wood.

956
01:38:55,405 --> 01:38:58,615
Now, get everything done.

957
01:38:58,991 --> 01:39:01,284
Mr. Wales!

958
01:39:01,703 --> 01:39:04,413
Did you come all this way to gawk?

959
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,457
If you don't work,
you don't eat around here.

960
01:39:07,709 --> 01:39:09,918
Didn't figure you for a loafer.

961
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:37,738
You know, she told me...

962
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:42,325
...it's the first time she ever had
a place of her own.

963
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:46,037
Grandma says it's our home.

964
01:39:46,497 --> 01:39:48,707
It is all of ours.

965
01:39:49,542 --> 01:39:52,836
I'm glad there will be a man
around to take care of things.

966
01:39:53,588 --> 01:39:56,381
I'll be dropping back from time to time...

967
01:39:57,175 --> 01:39:59,342
...probably just to hole up.

968
01:40:00,011 --> 01:40:02,387
Why don't you stay with us?

969
01:40:02,847 --> 01:40:04,723
Be our partner.

970
01:40:06,184 --> 01:40:07,517
They won't miss you.

971
01:40:07,727 --> 01:40:09,978
Maybe they'll forget you.

972
01:40:12,064 --> 01:40:14,524
You know there ain't no forgetting.

973
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:06,243
LITTLE JOSEY: Pa!

974
01:41:37,066 --> 01:41:38,775
TRAVIS: Hey there, Josey!

975
01:41:43,948 --> 01:41:46,116
CHATO: We're going to Santo Rio!

976
01:41:55,585 --> 01:42:00,589
GRANDMA & LAURA LEE (SINGING):
In the sweet by and by

977
01:42:00,798 --> 01:42:05,969
We shall meet in the beautiful shore

978
01:42:06,137 --> 01:42:11,308
In the sweet by and by

979
01:42:11,475 --> 01:42:16,897
We will meet on that beautiful shore

980
01:42:17,648 --> 01:42:19,649
In the sweet by and by

981
01:42:19,817 --> 01:42:21,651
(DOG HOWLS)

982
01:42:24,655 --> 01:42:30,118
We will meet on that beautiful shore.

983
01:42:31,037 --> 01:42:35,832
Lord, thanks a lot for bringing us
to this place.

984
01:42:36,834 --> 01:42:38,335
Pa and Daniel died...

985
01:42:38,628 --> 01:42:42,213
...at the hands of that low-down,
murdering trash out of hell...

986
01:42:42,673 --> 01:42:44,257
...that done them in.

987
01:42:44,842 --> 01:42:48,261
But they put up a good fight
and died the best they could.

988
01:42:48,888 --> 01:42:50,847
And thanks a lot for Josey Wales...

989
01:42:51,641 --> 01:42:54,935
...who you changed from
a murdering bushwhacker...

990
01:42:55,186 --> 01:42:56,937
...on the side of Satan...

991
01:42:57,188 --> 01:42:58,730
...to a better man...

992
01:42:59,023 --> 01:43:01,900
...in time to deliver us
from the Philistines.

993
01:43:02,526 --> 01:43:06,529
And thank you, Lord,
for getting us together in Texas.

994
01:43:14,246 --> 01:43:15,747
Are you all right?

995
01:43:15,957 --> 01:43:19,459
Ten Bears, he got Travis and Chato.

996
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:22,212
He'll be riding here in the morning.

997
01:43:24,882 --> 01:43:26,383
(SPEAKS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)

998
01:43:40,773 --> 01:43:43,817
If I was looking for a place
to hole up, I'd pick this one.

999
01:43:44,068 --> 01:43:46,569
Walls and ceiling, two feet thick.

1000
01:43:46,821 --> 01:43:48,947
All made out of mud, nothing to burn.

1001
01:43:50,199 --> 01:43:53,493
Two doors, front and back,
right in sight of one another.

1002
01:43:53,744 --> 01:43:57,789
These here crosses are to fire rifles
through. Up and down, side to side.

1003
01:43:58,082 --> 01:44:00,083
Tom Turner knew what he was doing.

1004
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:02,585
You bet he did.
I'll be shooting out of that door.

1005
01:44:02,753 --> 01:44:05,005
I'd rather have you sit right there...

1006
01:44:05,256 --> 01:44:07,507
...and do the loading.
Can you do that?

1007
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:09,134
I can.

1008
01:44:10,428 --> 01:44:11,636
Moonlight...

1009
01:44:12,263 --> 01:44:16,307
...I want you to go to this door.
You fire through here, all right?

1010
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,269
Laura Lee, right through this window.
Can you shoot?

1011
01:44:19,478 --> 01:44:20,603
I'll try.

1012
01:44:20,855 --> 01:44:24,107
Lone, you take this window
right over here, and the door.

1013
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:25,859
Where there's the most firing.

1014
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:30,280
You'll have to keep an eye on
that hallway there because...

1015
01:44:31,991 --> 01:44:36,119
...the only blind spot is the ceiling.
They'll get around to it eventually.

1016
01:44:36,370 --> 01:44:38,955
They can't shoot through it,
but they might...

1017
01:44:39,165 --> 01:44:42,333
...dig a hole in it and drop down,
maybe in the back bedroom.

1018
01:44:44,003 --> 01:44:45,378
Now remember...

1019
01:44:46,047 --> 01:44:49,174
...when things look bad,
and it looks like you won't make it...

1020
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,967
...then you got to get mean.

1021
01:44:51,177 --> 01:44:53,470
I mean plumb, maddog mean!

1022
01:44:53,971 --> 01:44:57,766
Because if you lose your head and give up,
then you neither live nor win.

1023
01:44:58,309 --> 01:44:59,809
That's just the way it is.

1024
01:45:00,186 --> 01:45:03,980
Use pistols at short range.
More fire power and less reloading.

1025
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:06,983
Keep this fire going.
Keep an iron on it red-hot.

1026
01:45:07,276 --> 01:45:09,277
Anybody gets hit, slap iron to it.

1027
01:45:09,487 --> 01:45:11,863
That's the fastest way
to stop the blood.

1028
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:17,410
GRANDMA: What's all that paint about?

1029
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:19,287
It's my death face.

1030
01:45:20,164 --> 01:45:24,209
You know, we're sure going to show them
redskins something tomorrow!

1031
01:45:24,502 --> 01:45:25,919
No offense meant.

1032
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:28,797
None taken.

1033
01:45:39,183 --> 01:45:40,308
Where's he going?

1034
01:45:40,684 --> 01:45:44,395
He knows he can do the best for us
on the back of a horse.

1035
01:45:44,688 --> 01:45:46,189
He's a guerrilla fighter.

1036
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:49,692
He figures he can carry the fight
to the enemy.

1037
01:45:49,902 --> 01:45:53,696
He's going down into the valley
to kill Ten Bears...

1038
01:45:54,031 --> 01:45:56,449
...and as many of the men as he can.

1039
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:58,868
How will he do that and come back here?

1040
01:46:00,371 --> 01:46:01,704
He won't come back.

1041
01:46:07,586 --> 01:46:09,212
Josey!

1042
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:36,859
You'll be Ten Bears?

1043
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:39,362
I am Ten Bears.

1044
01:48:44,034 --> 01:48:45,868
I'm Josey Wales.

1045
01:48:48,038 --> 01:48:49,706
I have heard.

1046
01:48:50,791 --> 01:48:52,542
You're the Gray Rider.

1047
01:48:52,793 --> 01:48:57,380
You would not make peace with
the Bluecoats. You may go in peace.

1048
01:48:59,091 --> 01:49:00,133
I reckon not.

1049
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:09,392
- Got nowhere to go.
- Then you will die.

1050
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,563
I came here to die with you.

1051
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:17,400
Or live with you.

1052
01:49:18,777 --> 01:49:21,904
Dying's not hard for you and me.
It's living that's hard...

1053
01:49:22,114 --> 01:49:25,116
...when all you ever cared about

People live together.

1055
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:36,252
Governments don't give you a fair word
or a fair fight. I've come here to...

1056
01:49:36,545 --> 01:49:39,255
...give you either one.
Or get either one from you.

1057
01:49:42,676 --> 01:49:46,262
I came here like this so you'll know
my word of death is true.

1058
01:49:46,638 --> 01:49:49,057
And that my word of life is then true.

1059
01:49:52,102 --> 01:49:56,856
The bear lives here, the wolf,
the antelope, the Comanche.

1060
01:49:57,316 --> 01:49:59,108
And so will we.

1061
01:50:00,152 --> 01:50:03,613
We'll only hunt what we need to live on,
same as the Comanche does.

1062
01:50:04,615 --> 01:50:07,700
And every spring when
the Comanche moves north...

1063
01:50:07,951 --> 01:50:09,494
...he can rest here in peace...

1064
01:50:09,787 --> 01:50:13,289
...butcher some of our cattle
and jerk beef for the journey.

1065
01:50:13,957 --> 01:50:17,710
The sign of the Comanche,
that will be on our lodge.

1066
01:50:17,961 --> 01:50:19,128
That's my word of life.

1067
01:50:19,797 --> 01:50:21,464
And your word of death?

1068
01:50:22,299 --> 01:50:25,510
It's here in my pistols
and there in your rifles.

1069
01:50:25,803 --> 01:50:27,136
I'm here for either one.

1070

we already have.

1071
01:50:32,309 --> 01:50:36,104
That's true.
I ain't promising you nothing extra.

1072
01:50:36,647 --> 01:50:39,816
I'm just giving you life,
and you're giving me life.

1073
01:50:40,025 --> 01:50:43,820
And I'm saying men can live together
without butchering one another.

1074
01:50:46,323 --> 01:50:50,827
It's sad that governments are chiefed
by the double-tongues.

1075
01:50:51,036 --> 01:50:55,164
There is iron in your words of death
for all Comanches to see.

1076
01:50:55,374 --> 01:50:58,376
And so there is iron
in your words of life.

1077
01:50:59,002 --> 01:51:02,547
No signed paper can hold the iron.

1078
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,841
It must come from men.

1079
01:51:05,634 --> 01:51:09,846
The words of Ten Bears carry
the same iron of life and death.

1080

It is good that warriors such as we
meet in the struggle of life...

1081
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:16,686
...or death.

1082
01:51:19,356 --> 01:51:21,274
