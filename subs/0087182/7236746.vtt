2
00:00:47.383 --> 00:00:52.088
A beginning is a very delicate time.

3
00:00:52.154 --> 00:00:57.393
Know then, that it is the year 10,191.

4
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.365
The known universe is ruled by the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV,

5
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:05.768
my father.

6
00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:09.472
In this time, the most precious
substance in the universe

7
00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:12.308
is the spice, melange.

8
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:15.978
The spice extends life.

9
00:01:16.078 --> 00:01:20.416
The spice expands consciousness.

10
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:24.933
The spice is vital to space travel.

11
00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:27.502
The Spacing Guild and its navigators,

12
00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.906
who the spice has mutated
over 4,000 years,

13
00:01:31.973 --> 00:01:39.080
use the orange spice gas, which
gives them the ability to fold space.

14
00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:45.620
That is; travel to any part
of the universe, without moving.

15
00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:47.427
Oh, yes.

16
00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:49.763
I forgot to tell you.

17
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.435
The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire universe.

18
00:01:55.502 --> 00:02:01.041
A desolate, dry planet
with vast deserts.

19
00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:06.847
Hidden away within the rocks of these
deserts are a people known as the Fremen,

20
00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:12.319
who have long held a prophecy
that a man would come,

21
00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:18.325
a messiah, who would
lead them to true freedom.

22
00:02:18.458 --> 00:02:26.967
The planet is Arrakis,
also known as Dune.

23
00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:11.190
<i>In the year 6041, before the</i>
<i>reign of the Padishah Emperors</i>

24
00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:16.128
<i>the Universe was ruled by thinking</i>
<i>machines with human minds...</i>

25
00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.498
<i>computers and conscious robots.</i>

26
00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:23.176
<i>The people deteriorated</i>
<i>into a state of apathy.</i>

27
00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:44.357
<i>Then they became victims and</i>
<i>slaves of other men with machines.</i>

28
00:05:59.376 --> 00:06:05.907
<i>Finally came the Great Revolt</i>
<i>- the religious crusade against the machines.</i>

29
00:06:12.558 --> 00:06:18.388
<i>After the Great Revolt, human beings</i>
<i>were forced to develop their minds.</i>

30
00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:22.309
<i>Thus, mental training</i>
<i>schools were established.</i>

31
00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:26.660
<i>These schools would change</i>
<i>the history of the Universe.</i>

32
00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:33.305
<i>Only two of these ancient</i>
<i>mental training schools remain.</i>

33
00:06:33.632 --> 00:06:40.012
<i>One is the Bene Gesserit school, which was</i>
<i>established primarily for female students.</i>

34
00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:42.224
<i>The function of the Bene Gesserit school</i>

35
00:06:42.253 --> 00:06:47.596
<i>is to carry on a selective</i>
<i>breeding program among humans.</i>

36
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:56.842
<i>Now the other existing school</i>
<i>The Spacing Guild, or The Guild</i>

37
00:06:56.843 --> 00:07:00.312
<i>emphasizes pure mathematics.</i>

38
00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:17.115
<i>The Guild's space Navigators, through</i>
<i>the use of the orange spice drug</i>

39
00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:19.032
<i>are able to fold space.</i>

40
00:07:19.662 --> 00:07:24.481
<i>That is, to guide spaceships without</i>
<i>moving, from one planet to another.</i>

41
00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:29.170
<i>It is through the Guild's monopolies</i>
<i>on the economic life of the Universe</i>

42
00:07:29.362 --> 00:07:31.897
<i>that makes it so powerful.</i>

43
00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:39.281
<i>Know then, that it is the year 10,191.</i>

44
00:07:40.134 --> 00:07:45.119
<i>The known universe is ruled by</i>
<i>the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.</i>

45
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.419
<i>For many years the Emperor Shaddam</i>
<i>IV has ruled on planet Kaitan</i>

46
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.082
<i>over all the Great</i>
<i>Houses of the Landsraad.</i>

47
00:07:56.083 --> 00:08:01.195
<i>The Great Houses of the Landsraad</i>
<i>are members of the royal families</i>

48
00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:04.655
<i>who rule or govern over the</i>
<i>major planets of the Universe</i>

49
00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:08.418
<i>according to the ancient</i>
<i>feudal system of government.</i>

50
00:08:08.916 --> 00:08:11.666
<i>Two of the great houses
of the Landsraad are</i>

51
00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.916
<i>the House of Atreides
on planet Caladan</i>

52
00:08:15.016 --> 00:08:17.516
<i>ruled by Duke Leto Atreides</i>

53
00:08:17.916 --> 00:08:21.166
<i>and the House of Harkonnen
on the planet Giedi Prime</i>

54
00:08:21.716 --> 00:08:24.516
<i>ruled by the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen.</i>

55
00:08:26.516 --> 00:08:28.016
<i>In this time,</i>

56
00:08:28.316 --> 00:08:30.666
<i>the most precious substance
in the Universe</i>

57
00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:32.916
<i>is the spice melange.</i>

58
00:08:33.566 --> 00:08:35.766
<i>The spice extends life.</i>

59
00:08:35.966 --> 00:08:38.716
<i>The spice expands consciousness.</i>

60
00:08:38.966 --> 00:08:41.416
<i>The spice is vital to space travel.</i>

61
00:08:43.016 --> 00:08:46.266
<i>CHOAM company controls
the mining of the spice.</i>

62
00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:48.916
<i>The CHOAM company is controlled</i>

63
00:08:49.016 --> 00:08:52.116
<i>by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

64
00:08:52.216 --> 00:08:54.816
<i>and the great houses of the Landsraad</i>

65
00:08:55.916 --> 00:08:59.816
<i>with the Guild and the Bene
Gesserit as silent partners.</i>

66
00:09:04.266 --> 00:09:06.466
<i>This combine is the key to the wealth</i>

67
00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:08.766
<i>and political power of the Universe.</i>

68
00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:14.466
<i>It is the Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

69
00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:17.916
<i>who dispenses CHOAM
directorships and contracts</i>

70
00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.816
<i>to the various great houses
of the Landsraad.</i>

71
00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:26.416
<i>The spice exists on only one planet
in the entire Universe.</i>

72
00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:30.816
<i>A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts.</i>

73
00:09:31.116 --> 00:09:35.566
<i>The planet Dune, also known as Arrakis.</i>

74
00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:40.366
<i>Up until this time,
the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen</i>

75
00:09:40.466 --> 00:09:43.766
<i>has held a directorship
from the Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>

76
00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:48.216
<i>giving him a contract to mine
the spice on planet Arrakis.</i>

77
00:09:49.916 --> 00:09:52.616
<i>The Baron Vladimir,
with his two nephews,</i>

78
00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:55.366
<i>the Count Rabban and Feyd Harkonnen,</i>

79
00:09:55.716 --> 00:09:57.916
<i>live on the planet Giedi Prime.</i>

80
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.966
<i>The planet Caladan is ruled
by Duke Leto Atreides,</i>

81
00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:05.416
<i>cousin to the Emperor Shaddam IV.</i>

82
00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:09.616
<i>He resides in the ancient Castle Caladan</i>

83
00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:13.116
<i>with the Bene Gesserit
Lady Jessica, and their son,</i>

84
00:10:13.416 --> 00:10:15.716
<i>the ducal heir, Paul Atreides.</i>

85
00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:21.066
<i>The Emperor, fearful of the
Duke's increasing popularity</i>

86
00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:23.816
<i>among the great houses
of the Landsraad</i>

87
00:10:23.916 --> 00:10:26.666
<i>has conspired with the Duke's
mortal enemies,</i>

88
00:10:27.416 --> 00:10:31.116
<i>the Harkonnens, to destroy
the House of Atreides.</i>

89
00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:35.016
<i>A secret report within the Guild...</i>

90
00:10:35.716 --> 00:10:38.816
<i>"Four planets have come
to our attention regarding a plot,</i>

91
00:10:39.016 --> 00:10:41.616
<i>"which could jeopardize
the spice production.</i>

92
00:10:43.066 --> 00:10:45.766
<i>"Planet Arrakis:
Source of the spice.</i>

93
00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:50.166
<i>"Planet Caladan:
Home of House Atreides.</i>

94
00:10:51.066 --> 00:10:54.366
<i>"Planet Giedi Prime:
Home of House Harkonnen.</i>

95
00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:58.916
<i>"Planet Kaitain: Home of the
Emperor of the Known Universe.</i>

96
00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:02.916
<i>"Send a third-stage
Guild Navigator to Kaitain</i>

97
00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:05.416
<i>"to demand details from the Emperor.</i>

98
00:11:05.516 --> 00:11:07.216
<i>"The spice must flow."</i>

99
00:12:08.272 --> 00:12:11.275
- Father?
- Irulan, you must leave.

100
00:12:29.385 --> 00:12:33.889
Why does the Guild send
a third-stage Navigator here?

101
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.293
The Spice.

102
00:12:37.393 --> 00:12:39.895
It has to be.

103
00:12:40.896 --> 00:12:43.899
He senses my plan.

104
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:52.073
My lord, the Reverend Mother is here.

105
00:12:52.074 --> 00:12:55.126
All entrance corridors and
chambers have been cleared.

106
00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:56.478
We are dismissed?

107
00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:58.981
Yes, yes, he'll sense
the least surveillance.

108
00:12:58.982 --> 00:13:01.483
No eavesdropping of any kind.

109
00:13:14.196 --> 00:13:18.133
A third-stage Guild Navigator
will be here within minutes.

110
00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.469
We felt his presence.

111
00:13:20.535 --> 00:13:24.973
I shall want telepathy during his visit
and a report when we're finished.

112
00:13:25.207 --> 00:13:27.509
Their minds are so...

113
00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:36.418
- They move in strange directions.
- Yes?

114
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.224
Forced spice evolution with
humans changes many things.

115
00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.293
I must sit close to him.

116
00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:47.095
He will not permit
anyone but me to see him.

117
00:13:47.295 --> 00:13:52.668
- You must be outside this room.
- I am your Truthsayer, my lord.

118
00:13:53.201 --> 00:13:55.036
He's here, my lord.

119
00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:26.701
<i>["The Bene Gesserit witch must leave."]</i>

120
00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:32.741
- Leave us.
- Yes, my lord.

121
00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:45.353
We are alone.

122
00:15:29.864 --> 00:15:34.536
- We have just folded space from lx.
- Yes?

123
00:15:35.136 --> 00:15:37.138
How was your journey?

124
00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:42.844
Many machines on lx.
New machines.

125
00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:45.914
Oh? Yes.

126
00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:51.953
Better than those on Richese.

127
00:15:52.053 --> 00:15:56.858
You are transparent.
I see many things.

128
00:15:57.158 --> 00:16:00.195
I see plans within plans.

129
00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:03.398
Is there a problem?

130
00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:06.901
Usually there's a problem
when one of you makes a visit.

131
00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:09.904
The answer is within the problem.

132
00:16:11.673 --> 00:16:15.243
I see two great houses,

133
00:16:15.377 --> 00:16:20.615
House Atreides,
House Harkonnen, feuding.

134
00:16:20.715 --> 00:16:25.553
- I see you behind it.
- Yes.

135
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.457
You must share with us.

136
00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:32.694
The Atreides House
is building a secret army

137
00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:34.763
using a technique unknown to us.

138
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:37.766
A technique involving sound.

139
00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:40.669
The duke is becoming
more popular in the Landsraad.

140
00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:42.871
He could threaten me.

141
00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:46.841
I have ordered House Atreides
to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice,

142
00:16:46.908 --> 00:16:49.744
thus replacing their enemies,
the Harkonnens.

143
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:54.282
House Atreides will not refuse because of the
tremendous power they think they will gain.

144
00:16:54.382 --> 00:16:56.318
Then, at an appointed time,

145
00:16:56.384 --> 00:16:59.588
Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis

146
00:16:59.688 --> 00:17:02.223
and launch a sneak attack
on House Atreides.

147
00:17:02.324 --> 00:17:07.228
I have promised the baron five legions
of my Sardaukar terror troops.

148
00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:12.000
So the Harkonnens
will rid you of House Atreides.

149
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.735
Yes!

150
00:17:13.735 --> 00:17:16.137
Listen to me.
The spice must flow.

151
00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:19.541
The spice has given me accelerated
evolution for 4,000 years.

152
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:21.843
It has enabled you to live 200.

153
00:17:21.943 --> 00:17:23.945
It gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhoods

154
00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:26.548
the metaphysical ability
to see beyond.

155
00:17:26.748 --> 00:17:28.550
You want superior powers.

156
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:32.053
Our power to fold space
is in the spice.

157
00:17:32.854 --> 00:17:34.956
Without us,
your empire will be lost.

158
00:17:34.956 --> 00:17:39.961
On isolated scattered planets,
you would be lost.

159
00:17:40.329 --> 00:17:43.065
One small point.

160
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:44.705
<i>Here it comes.</i>

161
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:51.041
We ourselves forsee a slight problem
within House Atreides.

162
00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.612
Paul. Paul Atreides.

163
00:17:55.678 --> 00:17:59.249
You mean, of course,
Duke Leto Atreides, his father.

164
00:17:59.315 --> 00:18:03.019
I mean Paul Atreides.

165
00:18:03.086 --> 00:18:05.672
We want him killed.

166
00:18:07.524 --> 00:18:12.762
I did not say this.
I am not here.

167
00:18:12.829 --> 00:18:14.797
I understand.

168
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.050
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

169
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.801
Well?

170
00:18:54.602 --> 00:18:56.704
They fear that putting House Atreides

171
00:18:56.704 --> 00:18:58.806
on Arrakis will hurt spice production.

172
00:18:59.307 --> 00:19:04.312
For us, a small amount is enough
to greatly extend our lives.

173
00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:06.814
But they consume
tremendous quantities.

174
00:19:07.615 --> 00:19:11.919
A great deal is needed
to evolve the seeing eye.

175
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.422
They worry.

176
00:19:14.422 --> 00:19:17.224
The Universe worries when
they worry. What else?

177
00:19:18.526 --> 00:19:21.128
So much was unclear.

178
00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:24.432
You may go, Helen Mohiam...

179
00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:26.834
Bene Gesserit.

180
00:19:28.336 --> 00:19:29.937
Yes, my lord.

181
00:19:33.841 --> 00:19:35.343
She's Bene Gesserit.

182
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:38.713
There's nowhere in the
Universe you can escape them.

183
00:19:38.713 --> 00:19:41.816
Her loyalty to the sisterhood is
stronger than her loyalty to me.

184
00:19:41.816 --> 00:19:43.718
Watch her carefully.

185
00:19:46.821 --> 00:19:52.560
Why would they want
the duke's son killed?

186
00:19:56.664 --> 00:20:01.902
We must have a look at
Paul Atreides, on Caladan.

187
00:20:21.212 --> 00:20:24.962
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

188
00:20:25.062 --> 00:20:27.762
<i>We want him killed.</i>

189
00:20:28.312 --> 00:20:33.162
<i>Why would they want the Duke's son killed?</i>

190
00:20:34.362 --> 00:20:37.662
<i>We must have a look at Paul Atreides.</i>

191
00:20:38.462 --> 00:20:39.962
<i>On Caladan.</i>

192
00:21:05.962 --> 00:21:08.612
<i>The powerful Bene Gesserit sisterhood,</i>

193
00:21:08.712 --> 00:21:10.062
<i>for 90 generations,</i>

194
00:21:10.162 --> 00:21:12.212
<i>has been manipulating bloodlines</i>

195
00:21:12.362 --> 00:21:14.712
<i>to produce the Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

196
00:21:14.962 --> 00:21:16.662
<i>A super being.</i>

197
00:21:17.412 --> 00:21:19.212
<i>On Caladan, Jessica,</i>

198
00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:22.312
<i>a member of the sisterhood
and the bound concubine</i>

199
00:21:22.412 --> 00:21:24.212
<i>of Duke Leto Atreides</i>

200
00:21:24.812 --> 00:21:27.612
<i>had been ordered to bear only daughters.</i>

201
00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.262
<i>Because of her love for the Duke,</i>

202
00:21:30.362 --> 00:21:33.662
<i>she disobeyed and gave
birth to a son, Paul.</i>

203
00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:35.862
<i>Paul Atreides.</i>

204
00:21:38.712 --> 00:21:41.712
Here we are now. Caladan.

205
00:21:42.762 --> 00:21:44.762
<i>And 19 light-years beyond.</i>

206
00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:47.412
<i>Beyond Bene Tleilax.</i>

207
00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:49.812
<i>The training planet of the Mentats,</i>

208
00:21:49.912 --> 00:21:51.312
<i>the human computers.</i>

209
00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:54.512
<i>Know a Mentat by his red-stained lips.</i>

210
00:21:54.812 --> 00:21:56.812
<i>There, Arrakis.</i>

211
00:21:57.362 --> 00:21:58.612
<i>Spice Mining.</i>

212
00:21:59.412 --> 00:22:01.612
<i>Carryalls lower the harvester to the sand,</i>

213
00:22:01.712 --> 00:22:04.362
<i>and lift it off to safety
when a worm attacks.</i>

214
00:22:04.462 --> 00:22:07.312
<i>Worms attack all rhythmic vibrations.</i>

215
00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:12.662
<i>Weather. See storms. No Precipitation.</i>

216
00:22:13.912 --> 00:22:16.812
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

217
00:22:18.812 --> 00:22:22.112
<i>And the Harkonnens are near. There.</i>

218
00:22:22.312 --> 00:22:24.812
<i>Giedi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen.</i>

219
00:22:24.962 --> 00:22:26.262
<i>The enemy.</i>

220
00:22:26.712 --> 00:22:28.712
<i>Saguaro, burrow bush,</i>

221
00:22:29.012 --> 00:22:32.012
<i>creosote bush, barrel cactus...</i>

222
00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:36.462
<i>The beginning is a very delicate time.</i>

223
00:22:38.062 --> 00:22:40.962
<i>Know then, that it is the year 10191.</i>

224
00:22:41.062 --> 00:22:43.862
<i>Gurney Halleck, a troubadour-warrior,</i>

225
00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:46.962
<i>is companion and teacher to Paul Atreides.</i>

226
00:22:47.512 --> 00:22:49.262
<i>Dr. Wellington Yueh,</i>

227
00:22:49.412 --> 00:22:52.212
<i>Royal Physician to the House of Atreides.</i>

228
00:22:52.612 --> 00:22:56.612
<i>He wears the diamond tattoo of
imperial conditioning on his forehead.</i>

229
00:22:56.912 --> 00:22:59.612
<i>This signifies that he has had
the highest conditioning</i>

230
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.762
<i>against taking human life.</i>

231
00:23:02.362 --> 00:23:06.362
<i>Therefore, this makes him safe enough
to attend to even an emperor.</i>

232
00:23:06.762 --> 00:23:09.812
<i>The spice is vital to space travel.</i>

233
00:23:09.962 --> 00:23:11.662
<i>The Spacing Guild...</i>

234
00:23:11.812 --> 00:23:14.912
<i>Among those who serve
Duke Leto Atreides</i>

235
00:23:15.012 --> 00:23:16.462
<i>is Thufir Hawat,</i>

236
00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:20.462
<i>Mentat Master of Assassins
to the House of Atreides.</i>

237
00:23:21.462 --> 00:23:24.512
<i>A Mentat is a human being
who is trained and conditioned</i>

238
00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:27.062
<i>for supreme accomplishments of logic.</i>

239
00:23:27.462 --> 00:23:30.512
<i>A human computer to perform certain duties.</i>

240
00:23:31.162 --> 00:23:34.112
I know, Thufir, I'm sitting
with my back to the door.

241
00:23:36.062 --> 00:23:39.312
I heard you, Doctor Yueh,

242
00:23:40.262 --> 00:23:41.912
and Gurney coming down the hall.

243
00:23:42.062 --> 00:23:43.462
Those sounds

244
00:23:44.312 --> 00:23:45.662
could be imitated!

245
00:23:48.062 --> 00:23:49.762
I'd know the difference.

246
00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:52.962
<i>Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</i>

247
00:23:55.912 --> 00:23:57.962
My father sent you to test me.

248
00:23:58.312 --> 00:23:59.712
Music, then?

249
00:23:59.862 --> 00:24:01.262
No music.

250
00:24:01.512 --> 00:24:04.362
I'm packing this for the crossing.

251
00:24:05.112 --> 00:24:06.112
Shield practice.

252
00:24:06.212 --> 00:24:07.212
Shield practice?

253
00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:09.562
Gurney, we had practice this morning.

254
00:24:09.662 --> 00:24:10.912
I'm not in the mood.

255
00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:12.312
Not in the mood?

256
00:24:12.762 --> 00:24:15.162
Mood's a thing for cattle and love play.

257
00:24:15.262 --> 00:24:16.312
Not fighting!

258
00:24:16.462 --> 00:24:17.912
I'm sorry, Gurney.

259
00:24:18.062 --> 00:24:19.512
Not sorry enough.

260
00:24:30.812 --> 00:24:32.362
<i>What's wrong with Gurney?</i>

261
00:24:32.462 --> 00:24:33.912
<i>He's not faking this.</i>

262
00:24:34.012 --> 00:24:37.812
Now, guard yourself for true!

263
00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.512
Is this what you seek?

264
00:24:59.212 --> 00:25:00.712
Good!

265
00:25:00.912 --> 00:25:04.212
The slow blade penetrates the shield.

266
00:25:04.362 --> 00:25:07.412
But down... look down.

267
00:25:09.962 --> 00:25:12.712
We'd have joined each other in death.

268
00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:16.662
You did seem finally to get in the mood.

269
00:25:24.012 --> 00:25:26.312
Would you really have drawn my blood?

270
00:25:26.712 --> 00:25:29.262
If you'd have fought one whit
below your abilities,

271
00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:32.312
I'd have given you a good scar
to remind you.

272
00:25:36.262 --> 00:25:38.362
Things have been so serious here lately.

273
00:25:38.512 --> 00:25:40.562
Soon we'll leave for Arrakis.

274
00:25:41.462 --> 00:25:43.062
Arrakis is real.

275
00:25:44.012 --> 00:25:45.962
The Harkonnens are real.

276
00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:49.562
Doctor Yueh,

277
00:25:49.662 --> 00:25:52.912
do you have any information
on the worms of Arrakis?

278
00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:57.062
I've obtained a filmbook
of a small specimen.

279
00:25:57.412 --> 00:25:59.662
Only 125 meters long.

280
00:26:00.462 --> 00:26:01.962
Only?

281
00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:04.262
There have been documented
sightings of worms

282
00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:08.712
as large as 450 meters
in the deep desert.

283
00:26:09.462 --> 00:26:12.312
That's far from where we'll be in Arrakeen.

284
00:26:13.512 --> 00:26:17.612
The desert belt and the south polar
region are marked forbidden.

285
00:26:18.212 --> 00:26:20.812
The storms and the worms.

286
00:26:22.662 --> 00:26:26.712
Is it true that the sand can blow
at 700 km per hour?

287
00:26:28.062 --> 00:26:30.612
It can render flesh into dust in minutes.

288
00:26:31.762 --> 00:26:34.162
And these dry winds can also generate

289
00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:37.762
tremendous amounts of static
electricity in the atmosphere.

290
00:26:38.262 --> 00:26:40.962
Our body shields won't have enough power

291
00:26:41.062 --> 00:26:43.362
to operate in the open air on Arrakis.

292
00:26:44.112 --> 00:26:45.962
How do the Fremen survive there?

293
00:26:46.112 --> 00:26:47.962
We don't know much about the Fremen.

294
00:26:48.362 --> 00:26:51.612
They live in the deep desert,
some of them in the cities.

295
00:26:51.712 --> 00:26:53.912
They have blue-within-blue eyes.

296
00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.662
Oh, the eyes!

297
00:26:56.212 --> 00:26:57.312
Yes.

298
00:26:58.012 --> 00:27:00.912
Saturation of the blood
by the spice melange.

299
00:27:01.762 --> 00:27:03.812
Could the spice affect us in other ways?

300
00:27:03.912 --> 00:27:06.112
Many dangers exist on Arrakis.

301
00:27:06.212 --> 00:27:07.212
For one,

302
00:27:07.412 --> 00:27:09.812
the Harkonnens would not have given up

303
00:27:09.912 --> 00:27:12.912
their CHOAM Company contract so easily.

304
00:27:14.412 --> 00:27:16.962
The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes.

305
00:27:18.212 --> 00:27:20.662
But behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.

306
00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:24.512
You'll make a formidable Duke.

307
00:27:29.762 --> 00:27:31.062
Now, remember,

308
00:27:32.162 --> 00:27:35.112
the first step in avoiding a trap

309
00:27:35.562 --> 00:27:37.612
is knowing of its existence.

310
00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:40.412
I know. But if it is a trap,

311
00:27:40.762 --> 00:27:42.162
then why are we going?

312
00:27:42.262 --> 00:27:43.862
We have our new army.

313
00:27:44.812 --> 00:27:46.162
Doctor Yueh,

314
00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:48.662
put the weirding module on him.

315
00:27:53.662 --> 00:27:54.912
Well...

316
00:28:13.262 --> 00:28:14.912
Clear and lock the room.

317
00:28:15.012 --> 00:28:17.062
Detachment, stand down.

318
00:28:26.062 --> 00:28:28.012
Activate a fighter.

319
00:28:46.962 --> 00:28:48.912
Make the range 2 meters.

320
00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:38.112
Precise control.

321
00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:43.262
It's not Duncan's style.

322
00:29:46.662 --> 00:29:48.062
Nor mine.

323
00:29:53.812 --> 00:29:56.112
That's his mother's influence.

324
00:30:16.122 --> 00:30:19.922
<i>Another member of the Duke's
household is Duncan Idaho,</i>

325
00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:22.972
<i>friend and swordmaster to Paul Atreides.</i>

326
00:30:23.272 --> 00:30:24.222
Duncan!

327
00:30:25.872 --> 00:30:29.372
Paul, I was just on my way
to say goodbye to you.

328
00:30:30.572 --> 00:30:32.672
I have to go on ahead, alone,

329
00:30:32.772 --> 00:30:34.222
I won't be seeing you for a while.

330
00:30:34.322 --> 00:30:36.572
I wish you were coming with us. Why?

331
00:30:36.672 --> 00:30:38.272
It's something for your father.

332
00:30:38.422 --> 00:30:40.072
He wants to talk to you.

333
00:30:40.822 --> 00:30:42.922
I'll see you on Arrakis.

334
00:30:45.122 --> 00:30:47.172
May the hand of God be with you.

335
00:30:47.322 --> 00:30:49.772
May the hand of God be with us all, Duncan.

336
00:31:27.072 --> 00:31:28.222
Father.

337
00:31:28.522 --> 00:31:30.522
Thank you for joining me, Paul.

338
00:31:31.372 --> 00:31:33.972
It'll be good to get to our new home

339
00:31:34.422 --> 00:31:36.822
and have all this upset behind us.

340
00:31:40.422 --> 00:31:43.822
Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations.

341
00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:48.272
He swears you are the finest
student he has ever taught.

342
00:31:50.222 --> 00:31:53.022
Yueh, Gurney, and Duncan say the same.

343
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:57.522
Makes me feel very proud.

344
00:31:57.672 --> 00:31:59.322
I want you to be proud of me.

345
00:32:12.172 --> 00:32:13.772
I'll miss the sea.

346
00:32:16.522 --> 00:32:18.972
But a person needs new experiences.

347
00:32:20.122 --> 00:32:22.722
They jar something deep inside,

348
00:32:23.772 --> 00:32:25.922
allowing him to grow.

349
00:32:27.522 --> 00:32:29.022
Without change,

350
00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:33.372
something sleeps inside us

351
00:32:36.072 --> 00:32:38.322
and seldom awakens.

352
00:32:42.572 --> 00:32:44.772
The sleeper must awaken.

353
00:33:10.022 --> 00:33:13.672
Arrakis. Dune.

354
00:33:14.322 --> 00:33:16.172
Desert Planet.

355
00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:22.122
<i>I will kill you.</i>

356
00:33:23.872 --> 00:33:25.872
The second moon.

357
00:33:34.572 --> 00:33:36.622
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

358
00:33:49.222 --> 00:33:51.622
<i>I know she has come to test him.</i>

359
00:33:51.722 --> 00:33:55.422
<i>No man has ever been tested with the box.</i>

360
00:33:56.272 --> 00:33:59.272
<i>Tonight, I may lose my son.</i>

361
00:34:24.072 --> 00:34:27.622
Jessica, you were told to bear
only daughters to the Atreides.

362
00:34:28.372 --> 00:34:29.422
Jessica!

363
00:34:29.522 --> 00:34:31.272
It meant so much to him.

364
00:34:31.822 --> 00:34:35.372
You thought only of
a Duke's desire for a son?

365
00:34:36.122 --> 00:34:38.022
Desires don't come into this.

366
00:34:38.222 --> 00:34:40.622
An Atreides daughter could have been wed

367
00:34:40.722 --> 00:34:43.422
to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach.

368
00:34:44.222 --> 00:34:47.522
We may lose both bloodlines now.

369
00:34:49.022 --> 00:34:51.922
I vowed never to regret my decision.

370
00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:56.872
I'll pay for all my own mistakes.

371
00:34:56.972 --> 00:34:59.372
And your son will pay with you.

372
00:35:08.822 --> 00:35:10.222
Is Arrakis...

373
00:35:11.522 --> 00:35:14.022
Is it really so terrible on Arrakis?

374
00:35:15.772 --> 00:35:16.922
My Duke...

375
00:35:17.022 --> 00:35:22.222
You entered into this with full knowledge
of the delicate edge you walked.

376
00:35:25.622 --> 00:35:29.122
Jessica... come...

377
00:35:31.472 --> 00:35:34.022
I wish I could stand in your place

378
00:35:34.122 --> 00:35:36.022
and take your sufferings.

379
00:35:36.922 --> 00:35:40.872
But we must each of us take our own path.

380
00:35:41.372 --> 00:35:42.922
I know.

381
00:35:47.572 --> 00:35:49.472
I understand.

382
00:35:49.872 --> 00:35:51.222
About Paul...

383
00:35:51.772 --> 00:35:55.222
What you did and why you did it,
we both know.

384
00:35:56.222 --> 00:35:59.122
But kindness forces me to tell you

385
00:35:59.222 --> 00:36:02.722
there is little chance you will
be the Bene Gesserit totality.

386
00:36:02.872 --> 00:36:06.972
However, I will observe him.

387
00:36:08.122 --> 00:36:09.222
In a few minutes, Jessica,

388
00:36:09.322 --> 00:36:12.972
your son will be proved
to be a living human being,

389
00:36:13.472 --> 00:36:15.772
or he will be a dead animal.

390
00:36:18.472 --> 00:36:19.722
He's here.

391
00:36:22.122 --> 00:36:24.872
Arrakis. Dune,

392
00:36:25.872 --> 00:36:27.872
Desert Planet.

393
00:36:28.722 --> 00:36:30.072
Moving.

394
00:36:31.572 --> 00:36:32.572
Moving.

395
00:36:54.522 --> 00:36:56.722
We'll salvage what we can.

396
00:36:57.222 --> 00:37:00.272
But I can tell you, dear God,

397
00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:03.122
for the father, nothing.

398
00:37:03.672 --> 00:37:05.672
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

399
00:37:05.772 --> 00:37:09.172
Did you really think you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?

400
00:37:09.272 --> 00:37:11.672
The Universe's super being?

401
00:37:11.772 --> 00:37:14.372
How dare you!

402
00:37:15.222 --> 00:37:17.322
My greatest student.

403
00:37:17.972 --> 00:37:21.572
And my greatest disappointment.

404
00:37:24.922 --> 00:37:27.322
He's awake. He's listening to us.

405
00:37:28.422 --> 00:37:31.572
Good! Ready yourself, young Paul Atreides.

406
00:37:31.672 --> 00:37:35.472
I want to see you in your mother's
chambers in one-quarter of an hour.

407
00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:39.672
Paul...

408
00:37:40.972 --> 00:37:42.972
This is very important.

409
00:37:48.722 --> 00:37:50.872
Remember you are a duke's son.

410
00:37:55.872 --> 00:37:58.522
<i>Kwisatz Haderach? The super being?</i>

411
00:37:59.722 --> 00:38:01.922
<i>For the father, nothing?</i>

412
00:38:12.972 --> 00:38:15.772
This is the Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam.

413
00:38:17.572 --> 00:38:19.872
She's going to observe you.

414
00:38:23.822 --> 00:38:24.822
Please.

415
00:38:24.922 --> 00:38:25.922
Jessica,

416
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.822
you know it must be done.

417
00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:30.572
Your Reverence.

418
00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:32.922
<i>What does she fear?</i>

419
00:38:34.422 --> 00:38:35.522
What about my father?

420
00:38:35.622 --> 00:38:36.822
Paul,

421
00:38:38.122 --> 00:38:41.572
listen to the Reverend Mother
and do what she tells you.

422
00:38:50.372 --> 00:38:52.772
Now, you,

423
00:38:54.622 --> 00:38:55.972
come here.

424
00:38:57.022 --> 00:38:58.822
<i>She's using the Voice.</i>

425
00:39:00.272 --> 00:39:01.172
No.

426
00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.522
<i>Some strength there.</i>

427
00:39:03.622 --> 00:39:05.022
<i>Surprising.</i>

428
00:39:05.722 --> 00:39:07.472
Come here!

429
00:39:07.622 --> 00:39:09.622
<i>Come here!</i>

430
00:39:11.022 --> 00:39:13.922
<i>Come here!</i>

431
00:39:26.672 --> 00:39:28.272
Do you see this?

432
00:39:30.872 --> 00:39:33.622
Put your right hand in the box.

433
00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.622
What's in the box?

434
00:39:35.722 --> 00:39:36.922
Pain.

435
00:39:37.122 --> 00:39:38.322
Stop!

436
00:39:39.722 --> 00:39:42.022
Put your hand in the box.

437
00:39:50.172 --> 00:39:52.512
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.

438
00:39:52.522 --> 00:39:55.422
Don't pull away or you'll feel the poison.

439
00:39:56.372 --> 00:39:58.872
A duke's son must know
about many poisons.

440
00:39:59.022 --> 00:40:02.372
This one kills only animals.

441
00:40:03.572 --> 00:40:05.672
Are you suggesting
a Duke's son is an animal?

442
00:40:05.772 --> 00:40:06.872
Let us say,

443
00:40:06.972 --> 00:40:09.322
I suggest you may be human.

444
00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:13.612
Your awareness may be powerful
enough to control your instincts.

445
00:40:13.622 --> 00:40:15.522
Your instinct will be

446
00:40:15.722 --> 00:40:17.972
to remove your hand from the box.

447
00:40:18.572 --> 00:40:20.172
If you do so,

448
00:40:21.472 --> 00:40:22.772
you die.

449
00:40:25.972 --> 00:40:27.772
You will feel

450
00:40:29.572 --> 00:40:31.322
an itching

451
00:40:34.122 --> 00:40:35.222
there.

452
00:40:36.472 --> 00:40:41.372
Now the itching becomes burning.

453
00:40:42.422 --> 00:40:46.422
Heat upon heat upon heat.

454
00:40:46.522 --> 00:40:48.672
- It burns.
- Silence, silence!

455
00:40:48.772 --> 00:40:52.122
<i>I must not fear.
Fear is the mind killer.</i>

456
00:40:52.472 --> 00:40:55.772
<i>And fear is the little death
that brings total obliteration.</i>

457
00:40:55.872 --> 00:40:57.722
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

458
00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:00.722
<i>I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.</i>

459
00:41:00.922 --> 00:41:01.972
<i>I must not fear.</i>

460
00:41:02.072 --> 00:41:04.872
- You feel the flesh crisping.
- <i>Fear is the mind killer.</i>

461
00:41:04.972 --> 00:41:08.172
<i>Fear is the little death that
brings total obliteration.</i>

462
00:41:08.272 --> 00:41:09.922
<i>I will face my fear.</i>

463
00:41:10.022 --> 00:41:12.222
Flesh dropping off.

464
00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:16.472
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>

465
00:41:16.922 --> 00:41:18.922
<i>I must not fear.</i>

466
00:41:19.022 --> 00:41:21.722
<i>Fear is the little death.</i>

467
00:41:22.022 --> 00:41:23.022
I'm...</i>

468
00:41:24.072 --> 00:41:25.322
The pain!

469
00:41:25.422 --> 00:41:26.822
No! Enough!

470
00:41:30.272 --> 00:41:31.722
Kull Wahad!

471
00:41:32.972 --> 00:41:35.672
No woman child ever withstood that much.

472
00:41:39.072 --> 00:41:43.272
Take your hand out of the box
and look at it, young human.

473
00:41:46.172 --> 00:41:47.522
Do it!

474
00:41:54.022 --> 00:41:55.822
Pain by nerve induction.

475
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:57.972
A human can resist any pain.

476
00:41:58.072 --> 00:42:01.122
Our test is crisis and observation.

477
00:42:01.472 --> 00:42:03.172
I see the truth of it.

478
00:42:03.272 --> 00:42:04.972
<i>Could he be the one?</i>

479
00:42:05.622 --> 00:42:06.622
<i>Maybe.</i>

480
00:42:07.622 --> 00:42:09.922
<i>But will he be ours to control?</i>

481
00:42:13.522 --> 00:42:16.622
You know when people speak the truth?

482
00:42:18.722 --> 00:42:20.022
I know it.

483
00:42:29.422 --> 00:42:32.722
Your mother wants you
to tell me about your dreams.

484
00:42:34.022 --> 00:42:35.972
I only want to know one thing.

485
00:42:36.972 --> 00:42:38.572
Do they come true?

486
00:42:39.272 --> 00:42:40.822
Not all of them.

487
00:42:41.972 --> 00:42:43.772
I know which ones will.

488
00:42:46.572 --> 00:42:51.022
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.

489
00:42:51.422 --> 00:42:52.972
What is that?

490
00:42:53.122 --> 00:42:55.972
The person who can be
many places at once.

491
00:42:56.072 --> 00:42:59.322
The one who bridges time and space.

492
00:43:01.422 --> 00:43:03.622
He will look where we cannot.

493
00:43:06.372 --> 00:43:08.772
Do you know of the Water of Life?

494
00:43:08.872 --> 00:43:11.722
The bile from the newborn worms of Arrakis?

495
00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:12.922
I have heard of it.

496
00:43:13.022 --> 00:43:14.372
It is very dangerous.

497
00:43:15.272 --> 00:43:18.472
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood
use it to see within.

498
00:43:20.022 --> 00:43:21.522
There is a place

499
00:43:22.972 --> 00:43:24.972
terrifying to us,

500
00:43:25.372 --> 00:43:26.672
to women.

501
00:43:27.622 --> 00:43:28.822
It is said

502
00:43:30.222 --> 00:43:32.122
a man will come.

503
00:43:33.272 --> 00:43:34.822
The Kwisatz Haderach.

504
00:43:36.472 --> 00:43:38.472
He will go where we cannot.

505
00:43:41.172 --> 00:43:42.922
Many men have tried.

506
00:43:43.872 --> 00:43:45.722
They tried and failed?

507
00:43:46.022 --> 00:43:47.972
They tried and died.

508
00:43:49.372 --> 00:43:50.872
Jessica.

509
00:43:56.372 --> 00:43:58.722
<i>My son lives!</i>

510
00:44:04.822 --> 00:44:07.072
I sense your teachings in him.

511
00:44:08.022 --> 00:44:10.172
Ignore the regular order of training.

512
00:44:10.322 --> 00:44:12.472
His safety requires the Voice.

513
00:44:13.222 --> 00:44:14.822
I've heard enough of my safety.

514
00:44:14.972 --> 00:44:16.522
What about my father?

515
00:44:17.472 --> 00:44:18.672
I heard your talking.

516
00:44:18.772 --> 00:44:20.972
You speak as if he were dead.
Well, he's not!

517
00:44:21.072 --> 00:44:22.422
- Paul!
- But he's not!

518
00:44:22.522 --> 00:44:25.072
And he won't die. Tell me he won't die.

519
00:44:25.172 --> 00:44:26.772
What can be done has been done.

520
00:44:26.922 --> 00:44:28.572
Mother, tell me!

521
00:44:42.122 --> 00:44:45.322
The Voice could save you.

522
00:45:03.622 --> 00:45:07.622
<i>The Baron Harkonnen sent
Duke Leto a gesture of peace.</i>

523
00:45:07.972 --> 00:45:10.922
<i>No way would the Duke
forego the art of Kanly,</i>

524
00:45:11.022 --> 00:45:12.622
<i>as vendetta was known.</i>

525
00:45:13.222 --> 00:45:17.421
<i>This then, is the Duke's response
as he sat writing at his desk...</i>

526
00:45:17.422 --> 00:45:19.872
<i>"Your offer of a meeting is refused.</i>

527
00:45:20.372 --> 00:45:23.972
<i>"I have ofttimes met your treachery,
and this all men know.</i>

528
00:45:24.522 --> 00:45:28.072
<i>"The art of Kanly still has
its admirers in the empire."</i>

529
00:45:28.522 --> 00:45:32.172
<i>Then he signed it, "Duke Leto of Arrakis",</i>

530
00:45:32.272 --> 00:45:35.422
<i>knowing full well that
this would annoy the Baron.</i>

531
00:45:36.672 --> 00:45:38.772
<i>With his ducal signet ring,</i>

532
00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:42.722
<i>the Duke put the seal of the House
of Atreides under his signature,</i>

533
00:45:42.822 --> 00:45:44.972
<i>"Duke Leto of Arrakis."</i>

534
00:45:49.772 --> 00:45:50.872
Vas!

535
00:45:58.672 --> 00:46:01.122
<i>Soon the Baron would have his answer.</i>

536
00:46:17.822 --> 00:46:21.222
<i>Among those who serve
the Baron is Piter De Vries,</i>

537
00:46:21.322 --> 00:46:23.822
<i>Mentat Master of Assassins.</i>

538
00:46:24.122 --> 00:46:26.172
<i>Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

539
00:46:26.272 --> 00:46:28.322
<i>Message for Mentat Piter De Vries.</i>

540
00:46:28.422 --> 00:46:31.172
<i>The Baron is impatient for Leto's reply.</i>

541
00:46:34.072 --> 00:46:36.272
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

542
00:46:36.372 --> 00:46:38.972
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

543
00:46:39.072 --> 00:46:41.472
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

544
00:46:41.572 --> 00:46:44.122
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

545
00:46:47.472 --> 00:46:49.472
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

546
00:46:49.572 --> 00:46:52.122
It is by the juice of Sapho
that thoughts acquire speed,

547
00:46:52.222 --> 00:46:54.622
that lips acquire stains,
that stains become a warning.

548
00:46:54.722 --> 00:46:56.772
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.

549
00:48:00.922 --> 00:48:01.872
My lord.

550
00:48:01.972 --> 00:48:02.922
Piter!

551
00:48:04.922 --> 00:48:07.622
The Atreides will be leaving
Caladan soon, Baron,

552
00:48:07.722 --> 00:48:10.922
and I have here your answer
from Duke Leto.

553
00:48:11.022 --> 00:48:13.272
What does Leto say, Piter?

554
00:48:13.372 --> 00:48:15.872
He wishes to inform you that vendetta,

555
00:48:15.972 --> 00:48:18.772
as he puts it, using the ancient tongue,

556
00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:21.872
the art of Kanly, is still alive.

557
00:48:21.972 --> 00:48:25.472
He does not wish to
meet or speak with you.

558
00:48:26.872 --> 00:48:29.572
I've made my peace gesture.

559
00:48:30.322 --> 00:48:33.322
The forms of Kanly have been obeyed!

560
00:48:34.672 --> 00:48:36.622
Bring in Feyd and Rabban.

561
00:49:03.822 --> 00:49:05.622
As you instructed me,

562
00:49:05.722 --> 00:49:07.822
I have enlightened your nephews

563
00:49:07.922 --> 00:49:09.222
concerning my plan--

564
00:49:09.372 --> 00:49:10.722
My plan!

565
00:49:11.822 --> 00:49:16.072
The plan to crush the Atreides.

566
00:49:17.372 --> 00:49:18.822
Feyd...

567
00:49:19.772 --> 00:49:21.172
Rabban...

568
00:49:22.272 --> 00:49:24.222
Go quietly.

569
00:49:25.572 --> 00:49:28.772
No other great house of the Landsraad

570
00:49:28.872 --> 00:49:32.772
must ever know of the
Emperor's aid to the Baron.

571
00:49:33.572 --> 00:49:37.772
The entire Landsraad
would turn against the Baron

572
00:49:38.922 --> 00:49:40.631
and the Emperor.

573
00:49:40.632 --> 00:49:42.744
Put the pick in there, Pete,

574
00:49:44.137 --> 00:49:46.986
and turn it 'round real neat.

575
00:50:07.995 --> 00:50:10.970
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

576
00:50:12.051 --> 00:50:14.933
Your skin, love to me.

577
00:50:16.007 --> 00:50:19.125
Your diseases, lovingly cared for...

578
00:50:19.419 --> 00:50:21.943
for all eternity.

579
00:50:28.504 --> 00:50:30.416
I will have Arrakis back for myself.

580
00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:34.681
He who controls the spice
controls the universe!

581
00:50:34.749 --> 00:50:37.005
And what Piter did not tell you...

582
00:50:37.146 --> 00:50:40.669
is we have control of
someone who is very close,

583
00:50:40.683 --> 00:50:43.306
very close to Duke Leto.

584
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:46.032
This person, this traitor,

585
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.305
will be worth more to us
than ten legions of Sardaukar!

586
00:50:50.424 --> 00:50:52.607
And who is this traitor?

587
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.867
I won't tell you who the traitor is...

588
00:50:55.902 --> 00:50:57.184
or when we'll attack.

589
00:50:58.507 --> 00:51:02.321
However, the duke will
die before these eyes,

590
00:51:02.546 --> 00:51:05.806
and he'll know, he'll know that it is l,

591
00:51:05.966 --> 00:51:10.156
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen,
who encompasses his doom!

592
00:52:27.366 --> 00:52:30.188
<i>This is what I'll do to</i>
<i>the duke and his family.</i>

593
00:52:46.172 --> 00:52:50.472
I once told you a daughter would
be conceived at a time of parting.

594
00:52:52.622 --> 00:52:54.022
I remember.

595
00:52:57.672 --> 00:53:01.322
Conceived in love at a time of parting.

596
00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:14.722
Arrakis is a hostile world though.

597
00:53:17.872 --> 00:53:19.972
I must be sure you want this.

598
00:53:24.172 --> 00:53:26.072
It has to be tonight

599
00:53:29.172 --> 00:53:31.472
under these influences.

600
00:53:41.072 --> 00:53:45.122
I could hear you with the wind.

601
00:53:48.122 --> 00:53:50.422
And I whispered yes.

602
00:53:53.672 --> 00:53:55.472
And I whispered...

603
00:53:57.422 --> 00:53:59.272
"I love you."

604
00:55:48.122 --> 00:55:50.872
Soon they will begin to fold space.

605
00:55:51.672 --> 00:55:54.922
<i>Far off in the control rooms
of the spice gas.</i>

606
00:55:55.622 --> 00:55:58.622
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

607
00:58:16.872 --> 00:58:18.772
And now,

608
00:58:19.322 --> 00:58:20.722
the prophecy.

609
00:58:22.322 --> 00:58:24.672
One will come.

610
00:58:25.772 --> 00:58:28.872
The voice from the outer world.

611
00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:32.022
Bringing the Holy War,

612
00:58:32.872 --> 00:58:34.322
the Jihad.

613
00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:37.422
Which will cleanse the Universe

614
00:58:37.572 --> 00:58:41.322
and bring us out of darkness.

615
00:58:55.872 --> 00:58:59.272
<i>Hidden away within the rocks
of these deserts on Arrakis</i>

616
00:58:59.372 --> 00:59:01.972
<i>are a people known as the Fremen.</i>

617
00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:04.622
<i>These people, the Fremen,</i>

618
00:59:04.822 --> 00:59:08.522
<i>have long held a prophecy
that a super being</i>

619
00:59:08.722 --> 00:59:10.622
<i>a male child of a Bene Gesserit</i>

620
00:59:10.722 --> 00:59:13.372
<i>with great mental powers and courage,</i>

621
00:59:13.572 --> 00:59:15.372
<i>the Kwisatz Haderach,</i>

622
00:59:15.722 --> 00:59:18.222
<i>will come and lead them to true freedom.</i>

623
00:59:45.172 --> 00:59:46.822
Mother and the son.

624
00:59:52.272 --> 00:59:55.222
<i>House Atreides took control of Arrakis,</i>

625
00:59:55.422 --> 01:00:00.422
<i>63 standard days into the year 10191.</i>

626
01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:03.872
<i>It was known that the Harkonnens,</i>

627
01:00:03.972 --> 01:00:06.122
<i>the former rulers of Arrakis</i>

628
01:00:06.222 --> 01:00:09.272
<i>would leave many suicide troops behind.</i>

629
01:00:09.822 --> 01:00:12.322
<i>Atreides' patrols were doubled.</i>

630
01:00:24.772 --> 01:00:25.972
Duncan!

631
01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:33.372
The Fremen have sent
a message to you, Sire.

632
01:00:40.072 --> 01:00:41.272
Have you read this?

633
01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.872
No, I was instructed it was for you.

634
01:00:44.622 --> 01:00:46.022
It says...

635
01:00:46.522 --> 01:00:48.672
"A column of smoke by day,

636
01:00:49.722 --> 01:00:51.772
"a pillar of fire by night."

637
01:00:53.522 --> 01:00:54.822
A warning.

638
01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:57.222
An obscure one, at best.

639
01:01:00.022 --> 01:01:02.622
What have you discovered
about the Fremen, Duncan?

640
01:01:02.722 --> 01:01:03.722
Tell me.

641
01:01:05.272 --> 01:01:06.822
Why haven't we heard from you?

642
01:01:06.922 --> 01:01:09.672
My lord, I suspect so much.

643
01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:13.822
I think they are the allies we seek.

644
01:01:13.972 --> 01:01:15.772
They are strong, fierce.

645
01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:18.922
They do not give their loyalty
easily or quickly.

646
01:01:19.272 --> 01:01:20.572
As you know,

647
01:01:20.672 --> 01:01:23.922
the Imperium has never been able
to take a census of the Fremen.

648
01:01:24.022 --> 01:01:28.272
Everyone thinks that there are but few
wandering here and there in the desert.

649
01:01:28.722 --> 01:01:30.022
My lord,

650
01:01:30.822 --> 01:01:34.072
I suspect an incredible secret
has been kept on this planet.

651
01:01:34.522 --> 01:01:37.722
That the Fremen exist in vast numbers.

652
01:01:38.922 --> 01:01:40.072
Vast!

653
01:01:40.922 --> 01:01:44.872
And it is they who control Arrakis.

654
01:01:51.922 --> 01:01:55.922
<i>Each trooper will be charged
with responsibility for preserving water.</i>

655
01:01:56.022 --> 01:02:01.222
<i>Our existence as an operating army depends
on these following water-saving procedures.</i>

656
01:02:01.372 --> 01:02:04.022
<i>Remember, water is life.</i>

657
01:02:07.772 --> 01:02:11.022
Why is the shield not yet up?

658
01:02:11.372 --> 01:02:14.822
Sir, we found and removed
another sabotage device.

659
01:02:15.172 --> 01:02:16.572
I think it'll go up now, sir.

660
01:02:21.672 --> 01:02:24.522
They're finding these
sabotage devices too easily.

661
01:02:35.522 --> 01:02:38.022
<i>House shield activating.</i>

662
01:03:17.022 --> 01:03:20.372
My lady, the local people,

663
01:03:20.622 --> 01:03:23.322
the maids and servants,
await your inspection.

664
01:03:23.472 --> 01:03:25.672
Hawat has cleared them.

665
01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:30.472
Excuse me, my lady.

666
01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:35.772
The Harkonnens may have
tampered with them medically.

667
01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:47.072
When you said Harkonnens,

668
01:03:48.672 --> 01:03:51.422
I didn't know you had so
much reason to hate them.

669
01:03:55.372 --> 01:03:56.772
Well, my wife...

670
01:03:58.872 --> 01:04:01.722
But, of course, you didn't know my wife.

671
01:04:03.972 --> 01:04:05.422
The Har...

672
01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:07.022
Forgive me.

673
01:04:07.672 --> 01:04:09.622
<i>They must have killed her.</i>

674
01:04:10.172 --> 01:04:13.072
Please excuse me if I can't talk about it.

675
01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:20.622
<i>He's holding something back.</i>

676
01:04:20.922 --> 01:04:25.022
<i>Yet, there's the Imperial conditioning.</i>

677
01:04:26.622 --> 01:04:28.672
<i>Assurance of trust.</i>

678
01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:38.822
<i>The Bene Gesserit mother, the legend.</i>

679
01:04:39.772 --> 01:04:41.422
<i>Where is your son?</i>

680
01:04:42.472 --> 01:04:45.972
<i>I must warn you. You are in great danger.</i>

681
01:05:02.022 --> 01:05:04.172
<i>My message, it's here.</i>

682
01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:13.322
There are more enemy bodies coming in
for your inspection, Doctor Yueh.

683
01:05:17.822 --> 01:05:19.272
Are you all right?

684
01:05:19.422 --> 01:05:20.872
Yes, I'm fine.

685
01:05:21.522 --> 01:05:22.922
Thank you, Thufir.

686
01:06:28.572 --> 01:06:32.222
<i>One carryall handles
four spice mining teams.</i>

687
01:06:32.622 --> 01:06:36.122
<i>However, it will fly only
two harvesters at a time.</i>

688
01:06:36.522 --> 01:06:39.822
<i>Today, we have 930 harvesters</i>

689
01:06:39.922 --> 01:06:42.672
<i>and 981 carryalls.</i>

690
01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:07.922
<i>Safe.</i>

691
01:07:24.922 --> 01:07:26.222
<i>Spice.</i>

692
01:07:58.872 --> 01:08:00.572
<i>The second moon.</i>

693
01:08:02.472 --> 01:08:04.522
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

694
01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:06.922
<i>Am I the one?</i>

695
01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:22.872
<i>A hunter-seeker!</i>

696
01:08:23.022 --> 01:08:25.072
<i>It can't get me if I don't move.</i>

697
01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:28.772
<i>It's too dark in here for it to see clearly.</i>

698
01:08:45.422 --> 01:08:47.522
<i>I've got to try to grab it.</i>

699
01:08:48.072 --> 01:08:51.122
<i>The suspensor field will make it
slippery on the bottom.</i>

700
01:08:51.222 --> 01:08:53.222
<i>I must grip it tightly.</i>

701
01:08:55.372 --> 01:08:57.572
<i>Who is operating that thing?</i>

702
01:08:58.472 --> 01:09:00.722
<i>It has to be someone in the palace.</i>

703
01:09:01.772 --> 01:09:03.022
<i>I could shout for help,</i>

704
01:09:03.122 --> 01:09:05.572
<i>but it would kill whoever opened the door.</i>

705
01:09:23.722 --> 01:09:25.772
<i>Hold still.</i>

706
01:09:49.922 --> 01:09:51.822
It would have killed me.

707
01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:56.322
I was its target. It went to the motion.

708
01:09:57.172 --> 01:09:58.672
Who are you?

709
01:09:58.872 --> 01:10:00.922
I am the Shadout Mapes,

710
01:10:01.772 --> 01:10:03.572
the housekeeper.

711
01:10:04.122 --> 01:10:07.522
I must cleanse the way between us.

712
01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:09.872
You saved my life,

713
01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.321
and we Fremen pay our debts.

714
01:10:12.322 --> 01:10:13.422
<i>A Fremen.</i>

715
01:10:13.522 --> 01:10:17.772
It is known to us that
you've a traitor in your midst.

716
01:10:18.222 --> 01:10:20.522
Who it is,we cannot say.

717
01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:23.222
But we are certain of it.

718
01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:35.072
A traitor.

719
01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:49.422
Set up a sonar probe immediately.

720
01:11:06.672 --> 01:11:07.972
Thufir!

721
01:11:09.572 --> 01:11:11.022
Did you find anything?

722
01:11:11.172 --> 01:11:12.622
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

723
01:11:13.122 --> 01:11:14.572
Keep looking.

724
01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:19.372
<i>And the traitor? God help us.</i>

725
01:11:23.622 --> 01:11:24.922
My lord...

726
01:11:25.422 --> 01:11:29.322
Again, my lord, I wish to
tender my resignation.

727
01:11:29.422 --> 01:11:31.372
Silence, Thufir. Stop acting the fool.

728
01:11:31.472 --> 01:11:33.222
I told you yesterday!

729
01:11:33.522 --> 01:11:34.922
If you made a mistake,

730
01:11:35.022 --> 01:11:37.222
it wasn't overestimating the Harkonnens.

731
01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:40.572
Their simple minds came up
with a simple trick.

732
01:11:42.772 --> 01:11:45.922
Paul survived this largely
because of your training.

733
01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:47.772
You didn't fare bad.

734
01:11:48.072 --> 01:11:49.772
Sit down, Thufir.

735
01:11:51.072 --> 01:11:52.472
My lord.

736
01:11:59.872 --> 01:12:00.872
Thufir,

737
01:12:02.522 --> 01:12:04.222
where is this traitor?

738
01:12:05.672 --> 01:12:07.622
I know you've cleared everyone,

739
01:12:07.722 --> 01:12:09.872
especially those close to us.

740
01:12:10.422 --> 01:12:13.072
But recheck and find him.

741
01:12:15.922 --> 01:12:18.772
<i>They have tried to take the life of my son.</i>

742
01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:25.872
Sector 6 through 80 progress reports, Sire.

743
01:12:26.122 --> 01:12:27.572
Take it, Thufir.

744
01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:33.722
Sector 680, copy the 6th, the
summit, the 8th, quadrant over

745
01:12:33.822 --> 01:12:37.122
the 9th plus 84 circles, weave
the 80 and call the 4th. Copy.

746
01:12:42.272 --> 01:12:45.972
8. Thufir Tawat, Mentat,
Master of assassins.

747
01:12:49.972 --> 01:12:52.122
The palace is now secure.

748
01:12:53.372 --> 01:12:56.472
The city of Arrakeen is under martial law.

749
01:12:57.072 --> 01:13:00.722
We have troops here
headquartered underground

750
01:13:00.822 --> 01:13:03.122
on sub-floors 6 through 10.

751
01:13:03.722 --> 01:13:05.722
The rest of the troops
are stationed in Arrakeen

752
01:13:05.822 --> 01:13:08.122
and we have some on the airfield.

753
01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:10.572
Our new army is still in training,

754
01:13:10.672 --> 01:13:13.322
but everything, everything is shielded.

755
01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.572
And with this shielding
we are impenetrable.

756
01:13:19.372 --> 01:13:20.372
Kyn...

757
01:13:20.972 --> 01:13:22.172
Kynes...

758
01:13:22.522 --> 01:13:24.222
Dr. Kynes is waiting.

759
01:13:24.772 --> 01:13:28.022
He is the Emperor's Judge of the Change

760
01:13:28.122 --> 01:13:30.872
monitoring the evacuation
of the Harkonnens

761
01:13:30.972 --> 01:13:33.172
and our taking control.

762
01:13:34.822 --> 01:13:37.572
He plans on taking you

763
01:13:37.672 --> 01:13:40.922
on an inspection
of the spice mining operation.

764
01:13:41.322 --> 01:13:45.422
Now, he may or may not

765
01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.822
be sympathetic to our cause.

766
01:13:48.022 --> 01:13:49.622
But, Sire,

767
01:13:50.872 --> 01:13:53.372
with the attempt on the young master,

768
01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:57.322
I am against your leaving the palace.

769
01:13:57.622 --> 01:13:59.322
The attempt failed.

770
01:13:59.422 --> 01:14:02.322
Harkonnen captives
have already been taken.

771
01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:05.822
We must crush the Harkonnen
machine on Arrakis.

772
01:14:06.572 --> 01:14:09.172
You all know what to do!

773
01:14:16.922 --> 01:14:21.322
Gurney, we desperately
need more spice miners.

774
01:14:21.472 --> 01:14:24.022
Many are threatening to leave
on the next shuttle.

775
01:14:24.122 --> 01:14:26.772
We need spice drivers,
weather scanners, dunemen.

776
01:14:26.872 --> 01:14:28.972
Any with open sand experience.

777
01:14:29.072 --> 01:14:31.672
You must persuade them to enlist with us.

778
01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:41.122
"They shall come all for violence."

779
01:14:41.972 --> 01:14:45.722
"Their faces shall sup up as the east wind."

780
01:14:48.072 --> 01:14:51.822
"And they will gather
the captivity of the sand."

781
01:14:52.972 --> 01:14:54.772
Very moving, Gurney.

782
01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:57.922
On your way.

783
01:15:03.322 --> 01:15:06.472
And take care of Doctor Kynes
until Paul and I arrive.

784
01:15:08.622 --> 01:15:11.072
We will not be prisoners here in this place.

785
01:15:11.172 --> 01:15:16.022
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert
go I forth to my work.

786
01:15:32.622 --> 01:15:33.922
Yes?

787
01:15:37.222 --> 01:15:39.322
I am the Shadout Mapes.

788
01:15:40.572 --> 01:15:43.122
Your housekeeper, noble-born.

789
01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:46.172
What are your orders?

790
01:15:46.272 --> 01:15:48.272
You may refer to me as "my lady".

791
01:15:49.672 --> 01:15:51.322
I'm not noble-born.

792
01:15:52.972 --> 01:15:55.672
I'm the bound concubine of Duke Leto,

793
01:15:56.372 --> 01:15:58.522
mother of the heir designate.

794
01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:00.372
"Shadout".

795
01:16:02.022 --> 01:16:03.822
That's an ancient word.

796
01:16:04.472 --> 01:16:07.322
You know the ancient tongues?

797
01:16:07.422 --> 01:16:09.822
I know many things.

798
01:16:10.822 --> 01:16:13.772
I know you came prepared for violence

799
01:16:13.872 --> 01:16:16.572
with a weapon in your bodice.

800
01:16:17.972 --> 01:16:19.722
My lady,

801
01:16:20.772 --> 01:16:23.172
the weapon was sent as a gift,

802
01:16:23.272 --> 01:16:25.472
if you should prove to be the one.

803
01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:27.622
And the means of my death

804
01:16:29.472 --> 01:16:31.472
should I prove otherwise.

805
01:16:38.522 --> 01:16:40.022
My lady,

806
01:16:40.572 --> 01:16:45.222
when one has lived with prophecy
for so long,

807
01:16:45.722 --> 01:16:49.922
the moment of revelation is a shock.

808
01:16:55.272 --> 01:16:57.172
<i>Duke Leto is now here.</i>

809
01:16:57.272 --> 01:16:59.872
<i>Spice mining inspection
to start immediately.</i>

810
01:17:17.522 --> 01:17:19.922
So, you are Doctor Kynes.

811
01:17:20.022 --> 01:17:21.872
The Judge of the Change.

812
01:17:21.972 --> 01:17:24.222
And the Imperial Ecologist, Sire.

813
01:17:24.322 --> 01:17:26.172
Our intelligence informs us

814
01:17:26.272 --> 01:17:28.872
that there's still a strong
Harkonnen presence.

815
01:17:28.972 --> 01:17:31.222
The process of removal continues.

816
01:17:32.172 --> 01:17:33.772
This is my son, Paul.

817
01:17:35.422 --> 01:17:36.472
Are you a Fremen?

818
01:17:36.572 --> 01:17:37.822
I've been on Arrakis

819
01:17:37.922 --> 01:17:41.022
in the service of the Emperor
long enough for my eyes to change.

820
01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:43.172
<i>In the service of the Emperor.</i>

821
01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:45.122
We are in your hands, Doctor.

822
01:17:45.222 --> 01:17:47.772
Your gift of the stillsuits
is much appreciated.

823
01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:50.722
Would you give us an explanation
of their workings?

824
01:17:51.122 --> 01:17:54.272
Well, this is a stillsuit
of Fremen manufacture,

825
01:17:54.522 --> 01:17:56.522
the most efficient type on Arrakis.

826
01:17:56.622 --> 01:17:57.922
Basically...

827
01:18:01.472 --> 01:18:03.022
It's all right, Gurney.

828
01:18:04.572 --> 01:18:05.772
Yes, Sire.

829
01:18:06.822 --> 01:18:10.122
Basically, it's a high-efficiency filter

830
01:18:10.572 --> 01:18:12.472
and heat exchange system.

831
01:18:13.072 --> 01:18:15.872
Perspiration passes through the first layer

832
01:18:16.122 --> 01:18:18.222
and is gathered in the second,

833
01:18:18.322 --> 01:18:20.222
where salt is separated.

834
01:18:20.622 --> 01:18:24.072
Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action.

835
01:18:24.772 --> 01:18:28.322
The reclaimed water
circulates to catch pockets,

836
01:18:28.522 --> 01:18:31.422
from which you can drink through this tube

837
01:18:31.772 --> 01:18:33.122
around your neck.

838
01:18:33.922 --> 01:18:36.972
Urine and feces are processed
in the thigh pads.

839
01:18:37.722 --> 01:18:40.472
Should you be in the open desert,

840
01:18:41.172 --> 01:18:43.522
remember to breathe
in through your mouth

841
01:18:43.672 --> 01:18:46.072
and out through this nose tube.

842
01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.822
With a Fremen suit in
good working condition,

843
01:18:48.922 --> 01:18:51.022
life can be sustained for weeks,

844
01:18:51.322 --> 01:18:54.272
even in the deep desert, Sire.

845
01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:57.272
My thanks.

846
01:18:57.822 --> 01:18:59.322
With your permission.

847
01:19:01.822 --> 01:19:03.522
You've worn a stillsuit before.

848
01:19:04.022 --> 01:19:05.022
No.

849
01:19:05.922 --> 01:19:07.722
Your suit is fitted desert fashion.

850
01:19:07.872 --> 01:19:09.772
Who told you how to do that?

851
01:19:10.372 --> 01:19:11.672
No one.

852
01:19:12.322 --> 01:19:14.272
It seemed the proper way.

853
01:19:17.472 --> 01:19:18.872
That it is.

854
01:19:19.072 --> 01:19:22.672
<i>He shall know your ways
as if born to them.</i>

855
01:19:24.522 --> 01:19:26.372
We're wasting time, Sire.

856
01:19:57.422 --> 01:19:59.372
<i>Air speed, 0-5.</i>

857
01:20:00.322 --> 01:20:03.522
<i>Ambient temperature,
300 degrees Kelvin.</i>

858
01:20:04.422 --> 01:20:06.572
<i>Air speed, 2-0.</i>

859
01:20:10.822 --> 01:20:13.322
<i>Ether bender, 75% efficiency.</i>

860
01:20:19.572 --> 01:20:22.972
That's where I told your sandmaster
to concentrate the harvesting today.

861
01:20:23.772 --> 01:20:26.372
Southeast, over the Shield Wall.

862
01:20:28.422 --> 01:20:32.072
<i>Ambient temperature,
350 degrees Kelvin.</i>

863
01:20:33.222 --> 01:20:35.472
<i>Air speed, 1-3-0.</i>

864
01:20:37.622 --> 01:20:39.622
<i>Caution. You've now cleared</i>

865
01:20:39.722 --> 01:20:42.522
<i>protective Shield Wall
and entered open desert.</i>

866
01:20:52.272 --> 01:20:53.972
Will we see a worm?

867
01:20:54.672 --> 01:20:58.072
Where there is spice and spice mining,
there are always worms.

868
01:20:58.172 --> 01:21:00.272
- Always?
- Always.

869
01:21:00.872 --> 01:21:02.572
Why do they come?

870
01:21:03.572 --> 01:21:05.572
To protect their territory.

871
01:21:05.722 --> 01:21:07.772
Vibrations attract them.

872
01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:11.072
<i>He must be a Fremen or in with them.</i>

873
01:21:11.872 --> 01:21:13.722
<i>He's studying us.</i>

874
01:21:13.822 --> 01:21:16.321
<i>He's hiding something about the spice.</i>

875
01:21:16.322 --> 01:21:19.922
Is there a relationship between
the worms and the spice?

876
01:21:21.372 --> 01:21:25.422
As I said, they defend the spice sands.

877
01:21:26.872 --> 01:21:29.772
As to their relationship with the spice,

878
01:21:31.072 --> 01:21:32.272
who knows?

879
01:21:35.772 --> 01:21:37.322
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.

880
01:21:37.422 --> 01:21:39.272
That's it. Spice mining.

881
01:21:40.222 --> 01:21:42.322
No other cloud quite like it.

882
01:21:44.922 --> 01:21:46.722
See the spotters over it?

883
01:21:46.822 --> 01:21:48.422
They're watching for wormsign,

884
01:21:48.522 --> 01:21:50.272
the telltale sand waves.

885
01:21:51.022 --> 01:21:53.922
Seismic probes on the surface, too, Sire.

886
01:21:55.372 --> 01:21:58.922
Worms can travel too deep
for their waves to show.

887
01:22:00.222 --> 01:22:02.372
Looks like a good patch of spice.

888
01:22:03.922 --> 01:22:05.372
Wormsign?

889
01:22:05.872 --> 01:22:07.272
Is it wormsign?

890
01:22:07.372 --> 01:22:09.372
Yes. Worm. Big one.

891
01:22:10.022 --> 01:22:12.372
You've got sharp eyes. May I?

892
01:22:15.922 --> 01:22:18.722
Calling Harvester Pad 9. Wormsign.

893
01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:20.822
<i>Who calls Pad 9?</i>

894
01:22:20.922 --> 01:22:22.122
Don't mention the Duke.

895
01:22:22.222 --> 01:22:24.222
This is an un-coded channel.

896
01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.622
Unlisted flight northeast of you.

897
01:22:26.722 --> 01:22:28.922
Wormsign on intercept course.

898
01:22:29.272 --> 01:22:31.672
Estimated contact, 15 minutes.

899
01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:34.472
<i>Have sighting confirmed.
Stand by for a fix.</i>

900
01:22:34.572 --> 01:22:37.372
<i>Contact in 16 minutes minus.</i>

901
01:22:37.572 --> 01:22:38.972
<i>Very precise estimate.</i>

902
01:22:39.072 --> 01:22:40.672
<i>Who's on that unlisted flight?</i>

903
01:22:42.972 --> 01:22:44.672
What happens now?

904
01:22:44.772 --> 01:22:48.072
The carryall will come
and lift off the spice harvester.

905
01:22:49.622 --> 01:22:51.472
Try to get in close over the harvester.

906
01:22:51.572 --> 01:22:54.122
You'll find this interesting, Sire.

907
01:22:54.422 --> 01:22:56.672
They work until the very last minute.

908
01:22:56.772 --> 01:22:59.322
Spotter control, there's
no sign of the carryall.

909
01:22:59.422 --> 01:23:01.372
It isn't answering.

910
01:23:01.872 --> 01:23:04.272
The worm is 8 minutes away, Sire.

911
01:23:04.372 --> 01:23:06.872
<i>Spotter control, give me
a report by the numbers.</i>

912
01:23:06.972 --> 01:23:09.172
<i>- Report 1.
- No contact.</i>

913
01:23:09.272 --> 01:23:11.272
- <i>Report 2.
- Negative.</i>

914
01:23:11.372 --> 01:23:13.472
- <i>Report 3.
- Negative, Sire.</i>

915
01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:17.122
<i>- Report 4.
- No contact. Repeat, no contact.</i>

916
01:23:17.372 --> 01:23:19.472
I think they've got our carryall.

917
01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:21.572
Damn it! Harkonnens.

918
01:23:22.022 --> 01:23:24.122
We're coming down to
take you off the harvester.

919
01:23:24.222 --> 01:23:26.222
All spotters are ordered to comply.

920
01:23:26.322 --> 01:23:27.622
Ordered by whom?

921
01:23:27.722 --> 01:23:29.022
Duke Leto Atreides.

922
01:23:29.322 --> 01:23:31.322
<i>Yes. Yes, Sire.</i>

923
01:23:31.422 --> 01:23:32.772
How many men do you have?

924
01:23:32.922 --> 01:23:34.272
<i>Full crew, 26 men.</i>

925
01:23:34.622 --> 01:23:36.672
But, Sire, we can't leave all this spice.

926
01:23:36.772 --> 01:23:38.122
Damn the spice!

927
01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:39.572
Get out of there!

928
01:23:49.222 --> 01:23:50.972
Two men in each of the spotters!

929
01:23:51.122 --> 01:23:52.872
You, over here!

930
01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:54.172
Run!

931
01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:55.772
Run!

932
01:24:02.072 --> 01:24:04.972
I can't see him yet, but he is very close now.

933
01:24:05.072 --> 01:24:08.222
Damn sloppy! Really damn sloppy!

934
01:24:08.322 --> 01:24:10.172
Come on, boys. Come on!

935
01:24:14.172 --> 01:24:16.072
We're going to be heavy, Sire.

936
01:24:16.372 --> 01:24:17.772
<i>Spice.</i>

937
01:24:18.922 --> 01:24:22.122
<i>Pure unrefined spice.</i>

938
01:24:28.372 --> 01:24:30.722
Here he is! We've got to go!

939
01:24:40.522 --> 01:24:42.222
Bless the Maker and his water.

940
01:24:42.372 --> 01:24:44.072
Bless the coming and going of Him.

941
01:24:44.172 --> 01:24:46.072
May His passing cleanse the world.

942
01:24:46.172 --> 01:24:48.072
What's that you're saying?

943
01:24:48.172 --> 01:24:49.372
Nothing.

944
01:25:25.972 --> 01:25:27.772
Gods, what a monster!

945
01:25:37.022 --> 01:25:39.722
Someone is going to pay for this, I promise.

946
01:25:42.972 --> 01:25:46.172
<i>He's more concerned
over his men than the spice.</i>

947
01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:50.472
<i>I must admit,
against all better judgment,</i>

948
01:25:51.222 --> 01:25:52.872
<i>I like this Duke.</i>

949
01:26:48.422 --> 01:26:50.122
Dr. Kynes,

950
01:26:51.072 --> 01:26:53.972
being in the employ of the Emperor,
as you are,

951
01:26:54.872 --> 01:26:59.672
perhaps it isn't wise for you to
associate too closely with us Atreides.

952
01:27:00.772 --> 01:27:02.472
On the contrary,

953
01:27:03.772 --> 01:27:05.872
I feel very comfortable here.

954
01:27:09.272 --> 01:27:11.622
Remember how precious water is here.

955
01:27:11.722 --> 01:27:13.772
It was a token of respect.

956
01:27:17.172 --> 01:27:18.922
Are you enlisting with us?

957
01:27:19.022 --> 01:27:21.972
You see through to the truth of the thing, Sire.

958
01:27:22.522 --> 01:27:24.072
That means a dual alliance.

959
01:27:24.222 --> 01:27:25.772
He's in with the Emperor.

960
01:27:26.072 --> 01:27:29.722
A dual alliance, yes.

961
01:27:30.472 --> 01:27:32.522
But not with the Emperor.

962
01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:34.472
The Fremen.

963
01:27:40.022 --> 01:27:42.472
Then let water be a bond between us.

964
01:28:30.022 --> 01:28:31.972
<i>Duke Leto's signet ring</i>

965
01:28:32.072 --> 01:28:34.872
<i>has come to represent
power and good fortune</i>

966
01:28:34.972 --> 01:28:38.222
<i>to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen
and many others.</i>

967
01:28:38.422 --> 01:28:41.922
<i>The Baron has sworn to destroy
the House of Atreides</i>

968
01:28:42.022 --> 01:28:45.222
<i>and steal the ducal ring for himself.</i>

969
01:28:53.222 --> 01:28:55.822
Sorry you have to sleep so far underground,

970
01:28:57.622 --> 01:28:59.922
but we can't take any chances.

971
01:29:01.922 --> 01:29:03.772
I see you're studying.

972
01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:06.022
Knowledge is strength.

973
01:29:07.672 --> 01:29:10.522
Yes, so said Thufir Hawat.

974
01:29:11.322 --> 01:29:15.622
One must have more than that to hold
Arrakis against our many enemies.

975
01:29:18.072 --> 01:29:19.672
Much more.

976
01:29:22.122 --> 01:29:23.172
Much...

977
01:29:24.522 --> 01:29:25.572
more.

978
01:29:35.672 --> 01:29:36.772
Paul...

979
01:29:43.172 --> 01:29:45.372
If anything should happen to me...

980
01:29:45.472 --> 01:29:48.572
Father, nothing's going to happen.

981
01:29:48.922 --> 01:29:50.022
Yes.

982
01:29:51.272 --> 01:29:54.122
But if it should...

983
01:29:54.572 --> 01:29:55.722
Yes?

984
01:29:55.822 --> 01:29:57.772
Unknown objects on screen.

985
01:29:57.922 --> 01:29:59.872
We are attempting to identify.

986
01:30:06.422 --> 01:30:07.922
I'll be back, son.

987
01:30:55.922 --> 01:30:58.222
Sleep well, my son.

988
01:31:11.022 --> 01:31:12.322
Father...

989
01:31:13.422 --> 01:31:14.822
drugged.

990
01:31:21.222 --> 01:31:23.722
<i>Jessica, what is wrong?</i>

991
01:31:24.372 --> 01:31:26.672
<i>Forgive me, my beloved concubine.</i>

992
01:31:27.972 --> 01:31:29.772
<i>I should have married you.</i>

993
01:31:30.672 --> 01:31:35.272
<i>Why hold a dream to ascend to the
throne through a political marriage?</i>

994
01:31:37.222 --> 01:31:39.222
<i>I should have married you.</i>

995
01:32:04.322 --> 01:32:05.672
What happened?

996
01:32:27.772 --> 01:32:29.022
Yueh!

997
01:32:29.322 --> 01:32:31.272
<i>He sabotaged the house generators.</i>

998
01:32:31.372 --> 01:32:33.372
<i>We are wide open!</i>

999
01:32:33.522 --> 01:32:35.972
<i>House shield deactivating.</i>

1000
01:32:36.422 --> 01:32:39.472
I've destroyed the new army's
weirding modules.

1001
01:32:39.772 --> 01:32:41.922
I've brought House Atreides down.

1002
01:32:42.022 --> 01:32:43.272
Why?

1003
01:32:43.372 --> 01:32:45.172
I wish to kill a man.

1004
01:32:45.822 --> 01:32:47.722
Not you, my dear duke.

1005
01:32:47.922 --> 01:32:49.822
You were already dead.

1006
01:32:49.922 --> 01:32:52.722
But you'll get close to the Baron
before you die.

1007
01:32:52.822 --> 01:32:56.022
You'll be tied and drugged,
but you can still attack.

1008
01:32:56.572 --> 01:32:58.572
You can still attack!

1009
01:32:59.622 --> 01:33:01.472
When you see the Baron,

1010
01:33:01.872 --> 01:33:04.522
you'll have a new poison gas tooth.

1011
01:33:06.072 --> 01:33:09.222
He'll want you close,
so he can gloat over you.

1012
01:33:10.572 --> 01:33:14.772
One bite on this tooth
and a strong exhale...

1013
01:33:16.172 --> 01:33:18.472
- Refuse.
- No, you mustn't!

1014
01:33:19.222 --> 01:33:23.772
Because, in return, I'll save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.

1015
01:33:29.522 --> 01:33:31.022
For Paul.

1016
01:33:46.122 --> 01:33:49.122
When you see the Baron,
remember the tooth.

1017
01:33:49.822 --> 01:33:51.272
The tooth!

1018
01:33:52.022 --> 01:33:53.272
The tooth!

1019
01:34:02.872 --> 01:34:05.572
The weirding modules, destroyed!

1020
01:34:13.622 --> 01:34:15.972
<i>Attention!</i>

1021
01:34:16.072 --> 01:34:20.222
<i>We are approaching target area.</i>

1022
01:34:20.232 --> 01:34:21.922
<i>The bomb scopes are set.</i>

1023
01:34:23.372 --> 01:34:27.072
The shield is down!

1024
01:34:29.272 --> 01:34:30.822
Open the doors!

1025
01:34:31.872 --> 01:34:33.072
Signals!

1026
01:34:35.372 --> 01:34:36.772
Get that shield up!

1027
01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.372
The shield!

1028
01:34:38.382 --> 01:34:41.622
<i>Man the planes.</i>

1029
01:34:45.922 --> 01:34:48.722
<i>Release the bombs.</i>

1030
01:35:05.732 --> 01:35:09.492
For now our body shields won't
operate in the open air on Arrakis.

1031
01:35:42.472 --> 01:35:45.472
Long live Duke Leto!

1032
01:36:40.572 --> 01:36:42.972
The drug was timed.

1033
01:36:44.972 --> 01:36:48.672
Dr. Yueh has been very valuable to us.

1034
01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:54.372
What a pity you must remain gagged.

1035
01:36:55.622 --> 01:36:57.822
We can't let ourselves be swayed

1036
01:36:58.072 --> 01:37:00.272
by your witch's voice, now, can we?

1037
01:37:01.222 --> 01:37:03.872
<i>Leto, where are you?</i>

1038
01:37:05.522 --> 01:37:06.922
Bring him here!

1039
01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:14.172
You've done a very good job.

1040
01:37:14.822 --> 01:37:16.622
He hardly feels a thing.

1041
01:37:53.622 --> 01:37:55.172
Open your mouth.

1042
01:37:56.672 --> 01:37:58.872
Open it. Open it!

1043
01:38:03.722 --> 01:38:06.622
You've done a good job, traitor.

1044
01:38:16.972 --> 01:38:19.522
They are alike, this mother and son.

1045
01:38:19.972 --> 01:38:21.022
<i>Paul!</i>

1046
01:38:23.122 --> 01:38:24.572
Dangerous.

1047
01:38:29.172 --> 01:38:31.572
The training they have had

1048
01:38:32.222 --> 01:38:34.822
beyond most people's imaginations.

1049
01:38:38.572 --> 01:38:39.572
<i>Get up.</i>

1050
01:38:40.122 --> 01:38:42.422
I leave them in your hands, Piter.

1051
01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:51.222
Goodbye, Jessica.

1052
01:38:52.272 --> 01:38:54.322
And goodbye to your sweet son.

1053
01:38:55.732 --> 01:38:58.199
I want to spit once on your head.

1054
01:38:58.579 --> 01:39:01.241
Just some spittle in your face.

1055
01:39:04.967 --> 01:39:06.669
What a luxury.

1056
01:39:11.972 --> 01:39:14.472
We were ordered to kill them. So, kill them!

1057
01:39:30.122 --> 01:39:32.622
What are your orders, Piter?

1058
01:39:32.972 --> 01:39:36.122
Take them to the desert,
as the traitor suggested.

1059
01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:39.072
The worms will destroy the evidence.

1060
01:39:39.672 --> 01:39:41.972
Their bodies must never be found.

1061
01:40:12.122 --> 01:40:14.572
I knew Yueh's wife.

1062
01:40:16.572 --> 01:40:20.572
I was the one who broke
his Imperial conditioning.

1063
01:40:25.222 --> 01:40:27.722
I've thought of many pleasures with you.

1064
01:40:29.872 --> 01:40:32.422
It is perhaps better that you die

1065
01:40:32.522 --> 01:40:34.822
in the innards of a worm.

1066
01:40:35.122 --> 01:40:37.872
Desire clouds my reason.

1067
01:40:39.222 --> 01:40:40.822
That is not good.

1068
01:40:41.772 --> 01:40:43.122
That is bad.

1069
01:41:38.022 --> 01:41:39.572
They're down on this floor somewhere.

1070
01:41:39.672 --> 01:41:41.072
Down there.

1071
01:42:00.822 --> 01:42:02.272
Duncan!

1072
01:42:18.722 --> 01:42:21.872
Back! Keep him back from me!

1073
01:42:32.122 --> 01:42:34.422
You wish now to join your wife?

1074
01:42:34.722 --> 01:42:36.372
Is that it, traitor?

1075
01:42:37.172 --> 01:42:38.472
She lives?

1076
01:42:38.922 --> 01:42:40.822
You wish to join her?

1077
01:42:44.322 --> 01:42:45.572
Join her, then.

1078
01:42:54.022 --> 01:42:56.272
You think you've defeated me?

1079
01:42:59.272 --> 01:43:03.722
You think I don't know
what I've gained for my wife?

1080
01:43:10.972 --> 01:43:12.522
Take him away.

1081
01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:15.972
Guards!

1082
01:43:36.772 --> 01:43:38.022
Where are they?

1083
01:43:38.122 --> 01:43:39.672
They're over the great desert.

1084
01:43:39.772 --> 01:43:41.772
Continue reconnaissance.

1085
01:44:05.922 --> 01:44:07.522
<i>Yueh's sign.</i>

1086
01:44:11.172 --> 01:44:12.972
<i>He's left us stillsuits.</i>

1087
01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:23.522
Don't touch my mother!

1088
01:44:23.622 --> 01:44:25.422
<i>He's trying the Voice.</i>

1089
01:44:25.772 --> 01:44:27.822
<i>The Reverend Mother
said it could save him.</i>

1090
01:44:27.922 --> 01:44:30.672
- Did you hear a noise from the little one?
- Huh?

1091
01:44:31.322 --> 01:44:33.872
I didn't hear anything.

1092
01:44:37.222 --> 01:44:38.772
The little one.

1093
01:44:41.372 --> 01:44:44.372
I'd like to have some fun before we kill her.

1094
01:44:55.972 --> 01:44:58.422
- Remove her gag.
- <i>Excellent!</i>

1095
01:45:02.072 --> 01:45:06.872
<i>Remove her gag.</i>

1096
01:45:15.972 --> 01:45:18.672
There's no need to fight over me.

1097
01:45:19.422 --> 01:45:24.272
<i>...to fight over me.</i>

1098
01:45:29.522 --> 01:45:30.972
<i>A poisoned blade.</i>

1099
01:45:39.472 --> 01:45:45.472
First cut my son's bonds.

1100
01:45:45.572 --> 01:45:52.972
<i>...my son's bonds.</i>

1101
01:45:53.072 --> 01:45:54.472
That's it.

1102
01:45:54.572 --> 01:45:57.272
<i>That's it.</i>

1103
01:46:07.372 --> 01:46:08.722
Oh, my God!

1104
01:46:39.672 --> 01:46:42.472
Duke Leto Atreides.

1105
01:47:09.272 --> 01:47:12.372
Someone's torn the insignia
off your uniform.

1106
01:47:14.172 --> 01:47:15.472
That's careless.

1107
01:47:15.622 --> 01:47:16.922
It was fate.

1108
01:47:20.222 --> 01:47:21.522
You don't say?

1109
01:47:29.472 --> 01:47:30.672
Fate.

1110
01:47:30.972 --> 01:47:34.472
Duke Leto Atreides.

1111
01:47:38.072 --> 01:47:41.022
Where is the ducal signet ring?

1112
01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:44.972
I must have his ring.

1113
01:47:47.122 --> 01:47:48.422
The ring!

1114
01:47:52.022 --> 01:47:55.222
He was brought to us as is, my lord Baron.

1115
01:47:57.272 --> 01:47:59.872
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!

1116
01:48:01.072 --> 01:48:04.472
<i>The doctor, Yueh, what did he say?</i>

1117
01:48:05.322 --> 01:48:07.322
<i>Paul and Jessica safe.</i>

1118
01:48:07.872 --> 01:48:09.972
<i>Yes. The tooth!</i>

1119
01:48:10.972 --> 01:48:12.372
He's coming around, Baron.

1120
01:48:12.472 --> 01:48:13.872
Where's your ring?

1121
01:48:15.022 --> 01:48:15.972
Huh?

1122
01:48:17.222 --> 01:48:18.522
You do not answer?

1123
01:48:18.622 --> 01:48:20.572
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

1124
01:48:21.422 --> 01:48:23.672
<i>You must come closer.</i>

1125
01:48:24.722 --> 01:48:28.022
The water of my life

1126
01:48:30.672 --> 01:48:31.822
for Paul.

1127
01:48:32.322 --> 01:48:35.622
He's crying. He's crying!

1128
01:48:36.672 --> 01:48:38.572
What does that mean, Piter?

1129
01:48:41.372 --> 01:48:43.672
<i>Come closer, Baron.</i>

1130
01:48:52.622 --> 01:48:54.022
<i>Jessica!</i>

1131
01:48:54.472 --> 01:48:55.522
<i>Paul!</i>

1132
01:48:55.722 --> 01:48:57.122
Leto!

1133
01:48:58.322 --> 01:49:00.222
Leto, he's dead!

1134
01:49:00.522 --> 01:49:02.422
Oh, he's dead!

1135
01:49:03.822 --> 01:49:04.922
I know.

1136
01:49:12.472 --> 01:49:14.172
Am I alive?

1137
01:49:16.372 --> 01:49:17.372
I'm alive?

1138
01:49:17.472 --> 01:49:18.472
Yes.

1139
01:49:19.822 --> 01:49:21.822
You're alive, my Baron.

1140
01:49:22.622 --> 01:49:24.422
I'm alive, eh?

1141
01:49:24.972 --> 01:49:26.822
I'm alive!

1142
01:49:27.572 --> 01:49:30.522
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1143
01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:41.572
I can't maintain any altitude.

1144
01:49:41.972 --> 01:49:44.472
I'll never reach the safety of rock.

1145
01:49:48.472 --> 01:49:50.372
Maybe that small rock.

1146
01:49:50.922 --> 01:49:52.672
Where are we, do you think?

1147
01:49:52.822 --> 01:49:54.572
The south polar regions.

1148
01:49:55.022 --> 01:49:56.372
The forbidden area.

1149
01:49:57.572 --> 01:49:58.672
Hold on.

1150
01:50:07.672 --> 01:50:09.222
Hurry!

1151
01:50:11.672 --> 01:50:13.572
Take the stillsuits!

1152
01:50:15.272 --> 01:50:16.572
Hurry!

1153
01:50:16.672 --> 01:50:18.622
This crash might bring a worm.

1154
01:50:23.922 --> 01:50:25.122
The signet.

1155
01:50:25.422 --> 01:50:28.172
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh!

1156
01:50:51.572 --> 01:50:53.522
<i>Where are my feelings?</i>

1157
01:50:53.622 --> 01:50:55.472
<i>I feel for no one.</i>

1158
01:50:59.872 --> 01:51:01.722
<i>The second moon.</i>

1159
01:51:17.822 --> 01:51:21.022
<i>I mean Paul Atreides.</i>

1160
01:51:21.472 --> 01:51:23.922
<i>We want him killed.</i>

1161
01:51:24.872 --> 01:51:27.472
<i>Why? Why do they want me killed?</i>

1162
01:51:28.522 --> 01:51:31.372
<i>It has to be something to do with the spice.</i>

1163
01:51:32.222 --> 01:51:33.572
<i>But what?</i>

1164
01:51:39.972 --> 01:51:43.672
<i>He who controls the spice,
controls the Universe!</i>

1165
01:51:51.572 --> 01:51:54.172
<i>This moon holds my future.</i>

1166
01:52:07.422 --> 01:52:10.622
<i>Never one drop of rain on Arrakis.</i>

1167
01:52:14.322 --> 01:52:17.822
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

1168
01:52:26.522 --> 01:52:28.372
<i>They will call me</i>

1169
01:52:28.972 --> 01:52:30.672
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1170
01:52:37.872 --> 01:52:41.072
Listen to me. Listen!

1171
01:52:42.072 --> 01:52:44.372
You wanted to know about my dreams.

1172
01:52:45.422 --> 01:52:47.872
Well, I've just had a waking dream.

1173
01:52:49.322 --> 01:52:52.122
Do you know why? The spice!

1174
01:52:53.022 --> 01:52:54.922
It's in everything here.

1175
01:52:55.072 --> 01:52:56.972
Calm yourself.

1176
01:52:57.172 --> 01:52:59.172
Like the Truthsayer drug.

1177
01:53:00.972 --> 01:53:02.272
It's a poison.

1178
01:53:03.372 --> 01:53:05.772
You knew the spice would change me.

1179
01:53:06.772 --> 01:53:08.272
But thanks to your teachings,

1180
01:53:08.372 --> 01:53:10.572
it's changing my consciousness.

1181
01:53:10.822 --> 01:53:13.672
I see it! I can see it!

1182
01:53:14.422 --> 01:53:15.972
<i>Is he the one?</i>

1183
01:53:17.472 --> 01:53:20.022
You carry my unborn sister in your womb.

1184
01:53:20.122 --> 01:53:21.422
<i>He knows.</i>

1185
01:53:32.722 --> 01:53:34.072
Father!

1186
01:53:38.322 --> 01:53:41.222
<i>Father, I promise,</i>

1187
01:53:41.322 --> 01:53:44.072
<i>one day the sleeper will awaken.</i>

1188
01:53:45.072 --> 01:53:47.472
<i>And I will avenge your death.</i>

1189
01:53:48.222 --> 01:53:50.922
<i>I will not stop until I destroy</i>

1190
01:53:51.022 --> 01:53:53.172
<i>the Emperor and the Baron.</i>

1191
01:53:58.622 --> 01:53:59.822
Father.

1192
01:54:15.372 --> 01:54:16.922
Go now.

1193
01:54:19.622 --> 01:54:23.522
Take him to his desert to die.

1194
01:54:25.522 --> 01:54:26.922
Go.

1195
01:54:57.922 --> 01:55:01.122
<i>Yueh's left the plan
for the weirding modules.</i>

1196
01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:14.672
We have to get to that mountain of rock.

1197
01:55:16.372 --> 01:55:19.972
We have entered the time when all
will turn against us and seek our lives.

1198
01:55:36.222 --> 01:55:38.172
It's further than I thought.

1199
01:55:39.772 --> 01:55:41.422
A worm is sure to come.

1200
01:55:43.732 --> 01:55:46.805
I'll plant this thumper.
That should divert it.

1201
01:56:15.036 --> 01:56:16.092
Remember...

1202
01:56:16.993 --> 01:56:19.918
walk without rhythm and
we won't attract the worm.

1203
01:56:20.123 --> 01:56:21.752
It will go to the thumper.

1204
01:56:24.272 --> 01:56:25.972
I'm ready.

1205
01:57:07.072 --> 01:57:08.572
Faster!

1206
01:57:10.572 --> 01:57:12.222
It's deafening!

1207
01:58:29.172 --> 01:58:30.822
<i>The spice!</i>

1208
01:58:33.472 --> 01:58:34.622
Do you smell it?

1209
01:58:34.772 --> 01:58:35.922
Yes!

1210
01:58:43.322 --> 01:58:44.322
Paul!

1211
01:59:00.922 --> 01:59:01.922
Paul!

1212
01:59:13.272 --> 01:59:15.022
<i>A thumper.</i>

1213
01:59:23.372 --> 01:59:25.872
<i>The worm! Spice!</i>

1214
01:59:26.422 --> 01:59:28.172
<i>Is there a relationship?</i>

1215
01:59:41.822 --> 01:59:43.172
What's happened?

1216
01:59:43.272 --> 01:59:45.072
Why did it leave?

1217
01:59:46.122 --> 01:59:49.072
Someone started another thumper.

1218
01:59:52.172 --> 01:59:53.872
We're not alone.

1219
02:00:23.322 --> 02:00:25.072
Man-carved steps.

1220
02:00:25.172 --> 02:00:26.522
Yes.

1221
02:00:40.922 --> 02:00:44.372
<i>Such stealth. I didn't hear them.</i>

1222
02:00:44.522 --> 02:00:47.922
Perhaps these are the ones
the Shadout Mapes told us of.

1223
02:00:48.222 --> 02:00:49.922
I will take the boy-man.

1224
02:00:50.672 --> 02:00:53.022
He shall have sanctuary in my tribe.

1225
02:01:01.522 --> 02:01:03.972
Stop! Get back!

1226
02:01:04.172 --> 02:01:06.272
She has the weirding way.

1227
02:01:08.572 --> 02:01:09.972
Great gods!

1228
02:01:10.722 --> 02:01:13.572
If you can do this to the strongest of us,

1229
02:01:13.922 --> 02:01:17.122
you're worth ten times your weight of water.

1230
02:01:20.122 --> 02:01:22.922
As the leader of my people,
I give you my bond.

1231
02:01:23.922 --> 02:01:26.422
Teach us this weirding way,

1232
02:01:26.872 --> 02:01:29.672
and you both shall have sanctuary.

1233
02:01:29.772 --> 02:01:32.722
Your water shall mingle with our water.

1234
02:01:34.422 --> 02:01:36.922
Then I will teach you our way of battle.

1235
02:01:41.072 --> 02:01:44.422
I give you the word bond
of a Bene Gesserit.

1236
02:01:44.922 --> 02:01:46.622
It is the legend.

1237
02:01:52.172 --> 02:01:55.122
I am Chani, daughter of Liet.

1238
02:01:56.622 --> 02:01:59.722
I would not have permitted you
to harm my tribe.

1239
02:02:01.272 --> 02:02:02.722
<i>From my dreams.</i>

1240
02:02:03.672 --> 02:02:05.722
<i>So beautiful.</i>

1241
02:02:06.672 --> 02:02:07.772
Come with me.

1242
02:02:07.872 --> 02:02:09.972
I'll show you an easier way down.

1243
02:02:23.122 --> 02:02:24.822
He surprised me.

1244
02:02:26.072 --> 02:02:27.822
It was an accident.

1245
02:02:28.622 --> 02:02:32.922
Stilgar, I invoke the Amtal Rule.

1246
02:02:33.272 --> 02:02:35.372
Jamis, you force this fight.

1247
02:02:35.572 --> 02:02:37.872
These people have my countenance.

1248
02:02:37.972 --> 02:02:41.272
If you should win, I will cut you down.

1249
02:02:41.372 --> 02:02:43.172
Jamis, I don't want to fight you.

1250
02:02:43.272 --> 02:02:45.472
- Maybe if I explain.
- Explain?

1251
02:02:46.422 --> 02:02:48.222
Explain death.

1252
02:02:48.322 --> 02:02:52.672
I am going to sheath my knife in your blood.

1253
02:02:54.322 --> 02:02:55.722
No shields.

1254
02:02:56.522 --> 02:02:58.422
I'm used to shield fighting.

1255
02:02:59.272 --> 02:03:00.822
Take my crysknife.

1256
02:03:04.772 --> 02:03:07.672
Jamis turns to the right
with his knife after a parry.

1257
02:03:09.022 --> 02:03:11.122
And watch for a knife switch.

1258
02:03:25.922 --> 02:03:28.872
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1259
02:04:18.572 --> 02:04:20.272
You have strength.

1260
02:04:21.272 --> 02:04:23.422
You shall be known as Usul,

1261
02:04:23.572 --> 02:04:26.372
which is the strength
of the base of the pillar.

1262
02:04:26.972 --> 02:04:29.372
This is your secret name in our troop.

1263
02:04:30.122 --> 02:04:32.822
But you must choose
the name of manhood,

1264
02:04:33.322 --> 02:04:35.522
which we will call you openly.

1265
02:04:38.522 --> 02:04:41.872
What do you call the mouse
shadow in the second moon?

1266
02:04:44.572 --> 02:04:47.572
We call that one Muad'Dib.

1267
02:04:48.772 --> 02:04:51.172
Could I be known as Paul Muad'Dib?

1268
02:04:52.072 --> 02:04:54.222
You are Paul Muad'Dib.

1269
02:04:55.722 --> 02:04:58.822
And your mother shall be
a Sayyadina among us.

1270
02:04:59.672 --> 02:05:01.322
We welcome you.

1271
02:05:02.822 --> 02:05:05.722
<i>The dream unfolds.</i>

1272
02:05:10.972 --> 02:05:12.622
And now...

1273
02:05:14.872 --> 02:05:16.222
the prophecy.

1274
02:05:18.622 --> 02:05:20.722
One will come.

1275
02:05:21.872 --> 02:05:24.272
The voice from the outer world.

1276
02:05:25.172 --> 02:05:27.472
Bringing the Holy War,

1277
02:05:27.972 --> 02:05:29.372
the Jihad,

1278
02:05:29.572 --> 02:05:31.922
which will cleanse the Universe

1279
02:05:32.122 --> 02:05:35.872
and bring us out of darkness.

1280
02:05:59.972 --> 02:06:02.422
The wife and sons of Jamis.

1281
02:07:23.672 --> 02:07:26.322
This water belongs to Usul.

1282
02:07:26.722 --> 02:07:29.122
May he guard it for the tribe.

1283
02:07:29.472 --> 02:07:32.422
May he be generous
with it in times of need.

1284
02:07:37.222 --> 02:07:41.272
Jamis carried 33 liters and
7 and 3.30 second drachms.

1285
02:07:41.372 --> 02:07:42.972
Do you accept them?

1286
02:07:46.472 --> 02:07:47.472
Yes.

1287
02:07:49.422 --> 02:07:50.872
Water masters!

1288
02:08:26.472 --> 02:08:27.672
Moisture!

1289
02:08:27.772 --> 02:08:28.972
Wind traps.

1290
02:08:30.122 --> 02:08:31.572
Huge ones.

1291
02:08:39.472 --> 02:08:42.372
Water. Millions of decaliters.

1292
02:08:43.422 --> 02:08:44.972
A treasure.

1293
02:08:45.122 --> 02:08:47.222
Greater than treasure, Usul.

1294
02:08:48.122 --> 02:08:51.172
We have thousands of such caches,

1295
02:08:52.672 --> 02:08:55.572
and only a few of us know them all.

1296
02:08:56.122 --> 02:08:58.322
And when we have enough,

1297
02:08:59.222 --> 02:09:02.122
we shall change the face of Arrakis.

1298
02:09:22.372 --> 02:09:24.472
Tell me of your home world, Usul.

1299
02:09:27.622 --> 02:09:30.022
<i>Tell me of your home world, Usul.</i>

1300
02:09:50.972 --> 02:09:52.322
What is it?

1301
02:09:53.772 --> 02:09:56.372
Liet, Chani's father,

1302
02:09:56.472 --> 02:10:00.022
and the leader of our people, is dead.

1303
02:10:00.122 --> 02:10:01.872
Killed by the Harkonnen.

1304
02:10:02.922 --> 02:10:05.372
<i>For the father, nothing.</i>

1305
02:10:06.172 --> 02:10:08.522
Both of us have lost our fathers.

1306
02:11:00.422 --> 02:11:02.522
Rabban! Rabban!

1307
02:11:04.872 --> 02:11:07.072
We're knee-deep in Atreides blood!

1308
02:11:07.172 --> 02:11:09.122
We've gutted them!

1309
02:11:09.222 --> 02:11:10.872
We've gutted them!

1310
02:11:15.222 --> 02:11:17.922
Rabban! Rabban!

1311
02:11:19.322 --> 02:11:22.172
I place you in charge of Arrakis.

1312
02:11:22.272 --> 02:11:25.172
It's yours to squeeze, as I promised.

1313
02:11:25.272 --> 02:11:30.072
I want you to squeeze
and squeeze and squeeze!

1314
02:11:30.172 --> 02:11:32.972
Give me spice! Drive them!

1315
02:11:33.072 --> 02:11:35.072
Drive them into utter submission!

1316
02:11:35.172 --> 02:11:38.272
Do not show the slightest pity or mercy!

1317
02:11:38.372 --> 02:11:41.522
Never stop! Go! Go!

1318
02:11:41.622 --> 02:11:42.772
Show no mercy!

1319
02:11:42.872 --> 02:11:44.022
Yes, Baron!

1320
02:12:04.772 --> 02:12:05.812
Feyd.

1321
02:12:15.972 --> 02:12:20.472
And when we've crushed
these people enough,

1322
02:12:21.622 --> 02:12:23.472
I'll send you.

1323
02:12:24.322 --> 02:12:25.422
Feyd.

1324
02:12:29.922 --> 02:12:31.522
Lovely Feyd.

1325
02:12:38.272 --> 02:12:40.422
Where's my doctor?!

1326
02:12:47.072 --> 02:12:48.372
<i>Jessica,</i>

1327
02:12:50.372 --> 02:12:52.772
<i>our Reverend Mother is too old.</i>

1328
02:12:53.722 --> 02:12:56.222
<i>She has been calling
through space and time</i>

1329
02:12:56.322 --> 02:12:58.472
<i>for you to come and let her rest.</i>

1330
02:12:59.922 --> 02:13:02.722
<i>She asks that you pass within</i>

1331
02:13:03.572 --> 02:13:05.622
<i>and become our Reverend Mother.</i>

1332
02:13:07.222 --> 02:13:11.372
If you be a Reverend Mother,

1333
02:13:13.622 --> 02:13:17.372
let Shai-Hulud judge now!

1334
02:13:20.972 --> 02:13:23.072
<i>The Water of Life.</i>

1335
02:13:26.922 --> 02:13:29.472
<i>But what of my unborn child?</i>

1336
02:13:30.772 --> 02:13:33.872
<i>One day, I will have to do this.</i>

1337
02:13:50.922 --> 02:13:53.172
<i>Following the Bene Gesserit tradition,</i>

1338
02:13:53.272 --> 02:13:55.472
<i>the old Reverend Mother
surrendered her life</i>

1339
02:13:55.572 --> 02:13:57.772
<i>as she surrendered her knowledge.</i>

1340
02:13:59.722 --> 02:14:03.872
<i>Jessica had successfully transmuted
the poisonous Water of Life.</i>

1341
02:14:04.472 --> 02:14:07.522
<i>Every man who has tried has died.</i>

1342
02:14:08.872 --> 02:14:10.622
<i>Am I the one?</i>

1343
02:14:11.522 --> 02:14:14.272
<i>The sleeper must awaken.</i>

1344
02:14:18.422 --> 02:14:20.922
<i>The tremendous power of the Water of Life</i>

1345
02:14:21.172 --> 02:14:24.772
<i>caused the premature birth
of Jessica's daughter, Alia.</i>

1346
02:14:25.422 --> 02:14:29.522
<i>Alia was born with all the knowledge
and powers of a Reverend Mother.</i>

1347
02:14:44.722 --> 02:14:48.222
Feyd, even though he's aging,

1348
02:14:48.422 --> 02:14:51.722
Thufir is one of the finest Mentats
in the Universe.

1349
02:14:52.672 --> 02:14:56.422
And he's mine, Feyd, all mine.

1350
02:14:59.822 --> 02:15:01.822
- Quiet now.
- I will.

1351
02:15:01.922 --> 02:15:03.172
Come.

1352
02:15:16.972 --> 02:15:18.472
Oh, Thufir!

1353
02:15:19.472 --> 02:15:22.272
I see they've installed
your heart plug already.

1354
02:15:23.922 --> 02:15:26.322
Don't be angry.
Everyone gets one here.

1355
02:15:27.522 --> 02:15:29.422
But this is not why we're here.

1356
02:15:30.672 --> 02:15:33.172
We've brought you a little cat, Thufir.

1357
02:15:34.722 --> 02:15:37.222
You must care for it, if you wish to live.

1358
02:15:38.422 --> 02:15:42.372
A poison has been introduced
into your body, Thufir Hawat.

1359
02:15:43.172 --> 02:15:46.972
By milking this smooth, little cat body,

1360
02:15:47.072 --> 02:15:49.022
you receive your antidote.

1361
02:15:49.172 --> 02:15:51.222
It must be done each day.

1362
02:15:54.372 --> 02:15:59.272
All I can see is an Atreides
that I want to kill.

1363
02:16:00.222 --> 02:16:03.122
Feyd, no, no!

1364
02:16:04.222 --> 02:16:06.772
Thufir's a Harkonnen now.

1365
02:16:06.972 --> 02:16:08.972
Aren't you, Thufir?

1366
02:16:09.622 --> 02:16:13.522
<i>My Duke, how I've failed you.</i>

1367
02:16:31.322 --> 02:16:33.272
<i>Chani, I love you.</i>

1368
02:16:35.322 --> 02:16:36.822
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

1369
02:17:02.272 --> 02:17:04.572
<i>The Holy Warriors.</i>

1370
02:17:05.622 --> 02:17:08.122
<i>No one ever dreamed there were so many.</i>

1371
02:17:09.722 --> 02:17:14.072
I am Usul. Paul Muad'Dib.

1372
02:17:18.022 --> 02:17:20.322
Our shared enemy, the Harkonnens,

1373
02:17:20.422 --> 02:17:22.722
are once again in control of Arrakis.

1374
02:17:24.072 --> 02:17:26.222
Stilgar, your leader,

1375
02:17:26.572 --> 02:17:29.672
has asked me and my mother
to teach you the weirding way

1376
02:17:29.772 --> 02:17:31.272
to crush the Harkonnens.

1377
02:17:32.772 --> 02:17:34.672
We must do more than this.

1378
02:17:35.572 --> 02:17:39.272
We must totally destroy
all spice production on Arrakis.

1379
02:17:40.872 --> 02:17:44.472
The Guild and the entire
Universe depends on spice.

1380
02:17:45.922 --> 02:17:48.922
He who can destroy a thing,
controls a thing.

1381
02:17:50.222 --> 02:17:53.022
I will take 100 of your warriors
and train them.

1382
02:17:53.772 --> 02:17:56.422
This 100 will train the thousands
that remain.

1383
02:17:57.472 --> 02:17:59.522
When the spice flow stops,

1384
02:18:00.072 --> 02:18:02.372
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.

1385
02:18:03.272 --> 02:18:07.072
The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.

1386
02:18:10.372 --> 02:18:15.072
Arrakis will become
the center of the Universe.

1387
02:18:17.322 --> 02:18:18.322
Orato!

1388
02:18:22.122 --> 02:18:25.672
This obelisk is of your hardest stone.

1389
02:18:27.822 --> 02:18:28.822
Kick it.

1390
02:18:35.672 --> 02:18:36.672
Hit it.

1391
02:18:42.272 --> 02:18:43.622
Yell at it.

1392
02:18:49.172 --> 02:18:50.422
Break!

1393
02:18:52.822 --> 02:18:55.422
Korba, cut it.

1394
02:19:08.772 --> 02:19:10.172
Move back.

1395
02:19:39.172 --> 02:19:42.422
This is part of the weirding way
that we will teach you.

1396
02:19:45.222 --> 02:19:48.722
Some thoughts have a certain sound

1397
02:19:49.622 --> 02:19:51.872
that being the equivalent to a form.

1398
02:19:52.622 --> 02:19:54.772
Through sound and motion,

1399
02:19:55.172 --> 02:19:59.222
you will be able to paralyze
nerves, shatter bones,

1400
02:19:59.572 --> 02:20:03.822
set fires, suffocate an enemy,
or burst his organs.

1401
02:20:04.422 --> 02:20:08.672
We will kill until no Harkonnen
breathes Arrakeen air.

1402
02:20:08.772 --> 02:20:11.172
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1403
02:20:21.722 --> 02:20:22.872
Stilgar.

1404
02:20:25.872 --> 02:20:27.122
- Muad'Dib.
- Hmm?

1405
02:20:27.222 --> 02:20:30.372
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1406
02:20:35.322 --> 02:20:37.872
<i>My name is a killing word.</i>

1407
02:20:38.172 --> 02:20:40.372
<i>They are ready to fight.</i>

1408
02:20:40.472 --> 02:20:42.222
<i>Yet in order to lead them,</i>

1409
02:20:42.322 --> 02:20:45.572
<i>I must conquer the worm,
conquer Shai-Hulud.</i>

1410
02:21:13.072 --> 02:21:16.072
Usul, it is time you become a sand rider

1411
02:21:16.172 --> 02:21:18.122
and travel as a Fremen.

1412
02:21:19.422 --> 02:21:22.172
Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch

1413
02:21:22.922 --> 02:21:25.172
and ride as a leader of men.

1414
02:21:33.222 --> 02:21:34.772
Two thumpers are planted.

1415
02:21:34.872 --> 02:21:36.822
The worm may not surface for the first.

1416
02:21:36.922 --> 02:21:38.922
He will rise for the second.

1417
02:21:39.272 --> 02:21:40.922
And remember,

1418
02:21:41.672 --> 02:21:44.772
when the worm approaches,
you must be utterly still

1419
02:21:44.872 --> 02:21:46.922
and close enough to plant the hook

1420
02:21:47.022 --> 02:21:49.322
firmly under a ring segment.

1421
02:21:49.672 --> 02:21:52.072
The worm will turn to lift this exposed area

1422
02:21:52.172 --> 02:21:54.422
as far from the abrasive sand as possible,

1423
02:21:54.522 --> 02:21:57.472
and it will take you with it to the top.

1424
02:21:59.222 --> 02:22:00.522
Do not get too close.

1425
02:22:00.622 --> 02:22:03.172
As he approaches,
the sand will engulf you.

1426
02:22:07.222 --> 02:22:09.522
Wait till the head of the worm passes,

1427
02:22:09.622 --> 02:22:12.072
then go, quickly.

1428
02:22:36.172 --> 02:22:38.372
Shai-Hulud.

1429
02:23:18.722 --> 02:23:22.222
<i>I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.</i>

1430
02:23:31.022 --> 02:23:33.772
<i>Only the very strong ones travel this deep.</i>

1431
02:23:34.472 --> 02:23:37.022
Usul has called a big one!

1432
02:23:37.522 --> 02:23:40.172
Again, it is the legend.

1433
02:25:39.622 --> 02:25:42.272
<i>Now we are ready for battle.</i>

1434
02:25:52.772 --> 02:25:56.622
Usul, these are 15 of our finest warriors

1435
02:25:56.822 --> 02:25:59.872
to serve you as your guard.

1436
02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:06.172
The Fedaykin.

1437
02:26:24.472 --> 02:26:25.472
Now.

1438
02:27:13.722 --> 02:27:14.722
Muad'Dib.

1439
02:27:26.722 --> 02:27:30.222
<i>When the spice flow stops,
all eyes will turn to Arrakis.</i>

1440
02:27:30.922 --> 02:27:34.872
<i>The Baron and the Emperor himself
will be forced to deal with us.</i>

1441
02:27:38.622 --> 02:27:43.072
Muad'Dib.

1442
02:27:43.172 --> 02:27:44.572
- What happened?
- Muad'Dib!

1443
02:27:44.872 --> 02:27:47.872
- What happened to you and your men?
- Muad'Dib, Muad'Dib!

1444
02:27:47.972 --> 02:27:49.772
- What are you saying?
- Muad'Dib!

1445
02:27:49.872 --> 02:27:50.872
- What are you saying?
- Muad'Dib!

1446
02:27:50.972 --> 02:27:51.972
- What?
- Muad'Dib!

1447
02:27:52.072 --> 02:27:53.072
Muad'Dib!

1448
02:27:54.972 --> 02:27:57.922
<i>He's been repeating that name
ever since we found him.</i>

1449
02:27:58.572 --> 02:28:02.822
Who is this Muad'Dib?

1450
02:28:09.172 --> 02:28:12.022
<i>In the two standard years that followed,</i>

1451
02:28:12.122 --> 02:28:16.472
<i>Muad'Dib and the Fremen brought
spice production to a standstill.</i>

1452
02:28:17.172 --> 02:28:20.122
<i>Fearing for his life, Rabban did his best</i>

1453
02:28:20.222 --> 02:28:23.472
<i>to hide this fact from his uncle, the Baron.</i>

1454
02:28:29.972 --> 02:28:33.372
<i>Paul's sister Alia matured
at a frightening rate.</i>

1455
02:28:33.472 --> 02:28:36.522
<i>Her small body harbored
tremendous powers.</i>

1456
02:28:38.072 --> 02:28:40.722
<i>Paul and Chani's love grew.</i>

1457
02:28:45.972 --> 02:28:47.572
We surprised a band of smugglers.

1458
02:28:47.672 --> 02:28:49.472
Too bad. I thought they were Harkonnen.

1459
02:29:02.022 --> 02:29:03.322
Gurney!

1460
02:29:07.022 --> 02:29:09.772
You've no need of your weapons
with me, Gurney Halleck.

1461
02:29:10.372 --> 02:29:11.372
Paul?

1462
02:29:13.322 --> 02:29:14.322
Paul?

1463
02:29:14.422 --> 02:29:16.072
Don't you trust
your own eyes?

1464
02:29:16.222 --> 02:29:17.922
They said you were dead.

1465
02:29:20.772 --> 02:29:21.772
They...

1466
02:29:22.522 --> 02:29:23.472
They said...

1467
02:29:29.172 --> 02:29:31.172
- Gurney!
- You young pup!

1468
02:29:31.272 --> 02:29:33.572
- Gurney!
- You young pup!

1469
02:29:41.372 --> 02:29:43.772
Do you know of the Water of Life?

1470
02:29:46.572 --> 02:29:51.372
Come watch the mystery of mysteries.

1471
02:29:52.222 --> 02:29:54.972
The end and the beginning.

1472
02:30:49.472 --> 02:30:51.272
The Water of Life.

1473
02:30:58.122 --> 02:31:00.072
The Water of Life.

1474
02:31:20.672 --> 02:31:22.772
<i>Emperor Shaddam IV,</i>

1475
02:31:22.872 --> 02:31:26.822
<i>you have one last chance to
take matters into your own hands</i>

1476
02:31:26.922 --> 02:31:30.272
<i>and bring the situation
under control on Arrakis.</i>

1477
02:31:30.372 --> 02:31:31.572
- What do you mean, one last--
- <i>Silence!</i>

1478
02:31:31.672 --> 02:31:33.872
<i>Do not speak! Listen!</i>

1479
02:31:33.972 --> 02:31:36.822
<i>You do not have more
than this one chance.</i>

1480
02:31:37.122 --> 02:31:39.722
<i>I represent the entire Guild in this matter.</i>

1481
02:31:40.472 --> 02:31:44.322
<i>Our navigators warn you that spice
production is in great danger.</i>

1482
02:31:44.422 --> 02:31:46.672
<i>A new Fremen leader, Muad'Dib,</i>

1483
02:31:46.822 --> 02:31:49.072
<i>has stopped spice mining on Arrakis.</i>

1484
02:31:49.172 --> 02:31:52.372
<i>Our navigators suggest
he is not of Arrakis.</i>

1485
02:31:52.472 --> 02:31:55.322
<i>No one on the outside world
has been able to see him.</i>

1486
02:31:55.422 --> 02:31:57.522
<i>We do not know who he is.</i>

1487
02:31:57.872 --> 02:32:00.072
<i>The Harkonnens cannot stop him.</i>

1488
02:32:00.922 --> 02:32:04.422
<i>Remedy this situation,
restore spice production,</i>

1489
02:32:04.522 --> 02:32:07.472
<i>or you'll live out your life
in a pain amplifier.</i>

1490
02:32:15.622 --> 02:32:17.122
<i>The Emperor will stop him.</i>

1491
02:32:17.222 --> 02:32:18.922
<i>He won't take the Water of Life.</i>

1492
02:32:19.922 --> 02:32:22.022
<i>That's why they want me killed.</i>

1493
02:32:22.172 --> 02:32:24.522
<i>They're afraid I'll take the Water of Life.</i>

1494
02:32:25.672 --> 02:32:29.122
I want 50 legions of Sardaukar
on Arrakis at once!

1495
02:32:29.472 --> 02:32:31.072
50 legions?

1496
02:32:31.222 --> 02:32:32.822
That's our entire reserves as well.

1497
02:32:32.922 --> 02:32:34.272
This is genocide,

1498
02:32:34.372 --> 02:32:38.572
the deliberate and systematic
destruction of all life on Arrakis!

1499
02:32:40.322 --> 02:32:41.872
<i>The Emperor is coming!</i>

1500
02:32:43.372 --> 02:32:44.472
<i>Chani!</i>

1501
02:32:46.572 --> 02:32:50.122
You were calling my name.
It frightened me.

1502
02:32:51.322 --> 02:32:52.422
Oh, Chani!

1503
02:32:53.822 --> 02:32:56.022
All the images of my future are gone.

1504
02:32:58.822 --> 02:33:01.222
I have to drink the Water of Life.

1505
02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:03.772
No, Paul, please.

1506
02:33:04.172 --> 02:33:05.922
I've seen the men who have tried.

1507
02:33:06.072 --> 02:33:07.772
I've seen how they died.

1508
02:33:07.872 --> 02:33:11.722
I'm dead to everyone unless
I try to become what I may be.

1509
02:33:14.722 --> 02:33:17.722
Only the Water of Life
will free what can save us.

1510
02:33:18.622 --> 02:33:19.722
Paul...

1511
02:33:23.922 --> 02:33:25.822
I must drink the sacred water.

1512
02:33:29.372 --> 02:33:30.972
We must go now.

1513
02:34:25.872 --> 02:34:29.122
Hurry. All I see is darkness.

1514
02:34:30.122 --> 02:34:31.222
Paul...

1515
02:34:33.722 --> 02:34:35.672
I will love you forever.

1516
02:34:36.372 --> 02:34:38.322
You are my life.

1517
02:34:48.222 --> 02:34:49.872
You are my life.

1518
02:34:56.272 --> 02:34:58.272
<i>Many men have tried.</i>

1519
02:34:58.422 --> 02:35:00.472
<i>They tried and failed?</i>

1520
02:35:00.972 --> 02:35:02.672
<i>They tried and died.</i>

1521
02:35:11.372 --> 02:35:13.322
<i>The worm is the spice.</i>

1522
02:35:13.472 --> 02:35:15.372
<i>The spice is the worm.</i>

1523
02:35:35.622 --> 02:35:37.522
<i>The worms.</i>

1524
02:35:54.172 --> 02:35:56.472
<i>They're not attacking. Why?</i>

1525
02:36:14.982 --> 02:36:16.506
Alia...

1526
02:36:17.700 --> 02:36:19.145
Mother.

1527
02:36:21.248 --> 02:36:22.940
It's Paul.

1528
02:36:25.350 --> 02:36:28.910
He's taken the Water Of Life.

1529
02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:39.772
<i>There is a place,</i>

1530
02:36:41.272 --> 02:36:43.072
<i>terrifying to us,</i>

1531
02:36:43.372 --> 02:36:44.622
<i>to women.</i>

1532
02:36:44.822 --> 02:36:47.522
<i>This is the place they cannot look.</i>

1533
02:36:54.522 --> 02:36:57.572
<i>Traveling without moving.</i>

1534
02:36:59.472 --> 02:37:02.022
<i>Now I truly control the worm</i>

1535
02:37:03.022 --> 02:37:04.822
<i>and the spice.</i>

1536
02:37:06.322 --> 02:37:10.522
<i>And I have the power
to destroy the spice forever!</i>

1537
02:37:40.772 --> 02:37:41.722
Paul.

1538
02:37:43.022 --> 02:37:44.022
Paul.

1539
02:37:45.222 --> 02:37:46.222
Paul.

1540
02:37:53.822 --> 02:37:55.172
Father!

1541
02:37:58.822 --> 02:37:59.772
Father,

1542
02:38:00.322 --> 02:38:03.272
the sleeper has awakened!

1543
02:38:09.372 --> 02:38:21.852
<b>Muad'Dib.</b>

1544
02:38:21.872 --> 02:38:23.022
Arrakis,

1545
02:38:24.522 --> 02:38:25.772
Dune,

1546
02:38:27.122 --> 02:38:28.622
Desert Planet.

1547
02:38:30.222 --> 02:38:32.222
Your time has come.

1548
02:38:33.122 --> 02:38:37.122
A storm is coming. Our storm.

1549
02:38:38.622 --> 02:38:41.872
And when it arrives,
it will shake the Universe.

1550
02:38:44.422 --> 02:38:48.022
Emperor, we come for you!

1551
02:38:48.922 --> 02:38:50.572
<i>The Emperor Shaddam IV</i>

1552
02:38:50.672 --> 02:38:52.822
<i>with his entourage and Sardaukar troops</i>

1553
02:38:52.922 --> 02:38:55.422
<i>set out immediately for Arrakis.</i>

1554
02:38:55.972 --> 02:38:57.672
<i>Sitting on his golden throne</i>

1555
02:38:57.772 --> 02:39:00.372
<i>in his luxurious and fortified spaceship,</i>

1556
02:39:00.572 --> 02:39:03.972
<i>the Emperor ponders on
his latest intelligence reports.</i>

1557
02:39:04.522 --> 02:39:08.472
<i>We will set down
on the pyramid's landing facility.</i>

1558
02:39:22.922 --> 02:39:25.422
Long live the fighters!

1559
02:39:25.622 --> 02:39:28.872
<b>Long live the fighters!</b>

1560
02:40:00.472 --> 02:40:03.322
<i>Meanwhile, the Baron Harkonnen</i>

1561
02:40:03.472 --> 02:40:06.172
<i>having been alerted to trouble on Arrakis</i>

1562
02:40:06.272 --> 02:40:09.472
<i>is on route to check
on his nephew Rabban.</i>

1563
02:40:25.222 --> 02:40:26.872
<i>Suspicion confirmed.</i>

1564
02:40:26.972 --> 02:40:29.022
<i>The Emperor's had Rabban seized.</i>

1565
02:41:11.272 --> 02:41:13.172
Stand by the main control room.

1566
02:41:43.222 --> 02:41:46.372
Gurney, when the storm hits,
set off the atomics.

1567
02:41:47.472 --> 02:41:50.222
I want an opening through
the entire shield wall.

1568
02:41:51.972 --> 02:41:54.722
Stilgar, do we have wormsign?

1569
02:41:57.722 --> 02:42:02.022
Usul, we have wormsign, the likes
of which even God has never seen.

1570
02:42:58.122 --> 02:43:02.372
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron.

1571
02:43:20.872 --> 02:43:22.672
Why have you brought me here?

1572
02:43:22.872 --> 02:43:26.372
Your Highness,
there must be some mistake.

1573
02:43:26.972 --> 02:43:28.872
I never requested your presence.

1574
02:43:28.972 --> 02:43:29.972
Ah!

1575
02:43:30.372 --> 02:43:32.722
But your lack of action demanded it.

1576
02:43:32.822 --> 02:43:34.422
Your dreadful mismanagement,

1577
02:43:34.522 --> 02:43:38.472
your bad judgment in assigning
to Rabban the governorship.

1578
02:43:38.972 --> 02:43:40.372
You've forced me to come here

1579
02:43:40.472 --> 02:43:42.922
and set things straight, personally.

1580
02:43:43.222 --> 02:43:46.622
And why did you not tell me of
the fighting ability of these people?

1581
02:43:46.722 --> 02:43:49.372
We've just flushed out a nest
of them in the open desert

1582
02:43:49.472 --> 02:43:53.772
and the women and children
overpowered some of our Sardaukar.

1583
02:43:53.922 --> 02:43:56.222
We managed only one hostage.

1584
02:43:56.422 --> 02:43:57.922
Bring in the hostage!

1585
02:43:59.072 --> 02:44:00.472
Only one!

1586
02:44:11.272 --> 02:44:14.822
I am a messenger from Muad'Dib.

1587
02:44:15.872 --> 02:44:17.672
Poor Emperor.

1588
02:44:18.172 --> 02:44:22.072
I'm afraid my brother won't
be very pleased with you.

1589
02:44:22.172 --> 02:44:23.472
Silence!

1590
02:44:23.572 --> 02:44:25.422
Kill this child. She's an abomination.

1591
02:44:25.672 --> 02:44:26.722
Kill her!

1592
02:44:27.872 --> 02:44:30.772
Get out of my mind!

1593
02:44:30.872 --> 02:44:33.472
Not until you tell them both

1594
02:44:33.572 --> 02:44:36.322
who I really am.

1595
02:44:36.472 --> 02:44:40.872
<i>...who I really am.</i>

1596
02:44:38.222 --> 02:44:39.472
Alia...

1597
02:44:41.622 --> 02:44:44.922
daughter of Duke Leto the Just

1598
02:44:45.222 --> 02:44:47.922
and the royal Lady Jessica.

1599
02:44:48.822 --> 02:44:50.022
Sister

1600
02:44:50.922 --> 02:44:54.722
of Paul Muad'Dib.

1601
02:44:54.822 --> 02:44:58.822
Paul's sister? Paul is Muad'Dib?

1602
02:45:09.172 --> 02:45:11.472
Alia keeps pace with the storm.

1603
02:45:15.772 --> 02:45:19.172
<i>With the storm, their air power
will be useless.</i>

1604
02:45:19.622 --> 02:45:22.622
<i>On Arrakis, it's desert power.</i>

1605
02:45:23.072 --> 02:45:24.072
Gurney...

1606
02:45:25.822 --> 02:45:26.872
Now!

1607
02:45:27.022 --> 02:45:28.122
Atomics!

1608
02:46:09.222 --> 02:46:10.772
Our army awaits us.

1609
02:46:12.472 --> 02:46:17.422
My brother is coming
with many Fremen warriors.

1610
02:46:18.922 --> 02:46:20.122
Impossible!

1611
02:46:20.222 --> 02:46:22.072
Not impossible.

1612
02:46:22.222 --> 02:46:25.722
I told you. He is here now.

1613
02:46:32.472 --> 02:46:35.622
<i>Father, today I will avenge your death.</i>

1614
02:46:59.572 --> 02:47:02.522
<i>Emperor, an impassable storm
has descended.</i>

1615
02:47:02.622 --> 02:47:05.722
<i>The Shield Wall has been
penetrated by atomics.</i>

1616
02:47:07.522 --> 02:47:09.222
Release the Sardaukar.

1617
02:47:09.322 --> 02:47:13.472
Baron, give this little
abomination to the storm.

1618
02:47:14.822 --> 02:47:17.422
<i>Wait for my brother, Baron.</i>

1619
02:49:47.172 --> 02:49:49.022
<i>Wait for my brother.</i>

1620
02:50:02.672 --> 02:50:04.872
Muad'Dib!

1621
02:51:00.522 --> 02:51:01.822
<i>Alia, now.</i>

1622
02:51:02.072 --> 02:51:03.772
<i>Come to me, Baron.</i>

1623
02:51:24.922 --> 02:51:27.122
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1624
02:52:25.222 --> 02:52:26.872
<b>Muad'Dib!</b>

1625
02:53:07.772 --> 02:53:09.572
<i>Feyd Rautha.</i>

1626
02:53:09.772 --> 02:53:12.172
Emperor Shaddam IV,

1627
02:53:12.272 --> 02:53:14.372
there are Guild Heighliners above us

1628
02:53:14.472 --> 02:53:16.922
containing many Great Houses
of the Landsraad.

1629
02:53:17.172 --> 02:53:18.570
Send them back.

1630
02:53:18.572 --> 02:53:20.272
How dare you speak to me in--

1631
02:53:20.572 --> 02:53:21.872
<i>Stop your speaking.</i>

1632
02:53:24.622 --> 02:53:27.022
You have some idea of what I could do.

1633
02:53:29.822 --> 02:53:32.672
Don't try your powers on me.

1634
02:53:33.822 --> 02:53:36.222
Try looking into that place
where you dare not look.

1635
02:53:36.322 --> 02:53:38.072
You'll find me there staring back at you.

1636
02:53:38.172 --> 02:53:40.472
- You mustn't speak--
- Silence!

1637
02:53:44.522 --> 02:53:46.322
I remember your gom jabbar.

1638
02:53:47.472 --> 02:53:49.272
Now you'll remember mine.

1639
02:53:49.422 --> 02:53:51.222
I can kill with a word.

1640
02:53:53.572 --> 02:53:55.772
And his word shall carry death eternal

1641
02:53:56.972 --> 02:53:58.872
to those who stand against the righteous.

1642
02:53:58.872 --> 02:54:00.372
The righteous?!

1643
02:54:00.472 --> 02:54:02.722
There is a Harkonnen among you.

1644
02:54:05.222 --> 02:54:09.122
Give the Harkonnen a blade,
and let him stand forth.

1645
02:54:09.222 --> 02:54:12.872
If Feyd wishes, he can meet you
with my blade in his hand.

1646
02:54:12.972 --> 02:54:14.072
I wish it.

1647
02:54:14.172 --> 02:54:16.172
This is a Harkonnen animal.

1648
02:54:16.972 --> 02:54:19.322
Let me. Please, my lord.

1649
02:54:19.972 --> 02:54:21.522
The Emperor's blade.

1650
02:54:52.622 --> 02:54:54.822
Why prolong the inevitable?

1651
02:54:57.772 --> 02:54:59.172
I will kill you.

1652
02:55:14.922 --> 02:55:16.472
I will kill him!

1653
02:55:23.372 --> 02:55:24.472
Paul!

1654
02:55:25.922 --> 02:55:27.722
I will kill him!

1655
02:55:37.572 --> 02:55:41.172
Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps?

1656
02:55:42.172 --> 02:55:44.972
Will she deserve my special attentions?

1657
02:55:56.622 --> 02:55:59.422
You see your death.

1658
02:56:00.222 --> 02:56:02.222
My blade will finish you.

1659
02:56:04.422 --> 02:56:07.722
<i>I will bend like a reed in the wind.</i>

1660
02:56:31.972 --> 02:56:33.522
Muad'Dib!

1661
02:56:34.322 --> 02:56:36.972
Usul no longer needs the weirding module.

1662
02:56:37.022 --> 02:56:41.522
<i>Muad'Dib had become the hand of God
fulfilling the Fremen prophecy.</i>

1663
02:56:42.122 --> 02:56:43.672
<i>Where there was war,</i>

1664
02:56:43.772 --> 02:56:46.022
<i>Muad'Dib would now bring peace.</i>

1665
02:56:46.572 --> 02:56:49.972
<i>Where there was hatred,
Muad'Dib would bring love</i>

1666
02:56:50.622 --> 02:56:53.272
<i>to lead the people to true freedom</i>

1667
02:56:53.472 --> 02:56:56.122
<i>and to change the face of Arrakis.</i>

1668
02:57:01.672 --> 02:57:03.572
We Fremen have a saying.

1669
02:57:04.672 --> 02:57:07.622
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.

1670
02:57:09.022 --> 02:57:11.872
One cannot go against the word of God.

1671
02:58:19.122 --> 02:58:21.222
And how can this be?

1672
02:58:23.372 --> 02:58:26.972
For he is the Kwisatz Haderach!
