1
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:10.161
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

2
00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.915
I do assignments...

3
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.751
...designated targets.

4
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.256
Some jobs
need to look like accidents.

5
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.845
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

6
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.936
A select few
need to send a clear message.

7
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.609
Pulling a trigger is easy.

8
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:47.073
The best jobs are the ones
nobody even knows you were there.

9
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.771
Liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night.

10
00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.066
Left me a big old bottle of Scotch.

11
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.985
He even sprung for the good stuff.

12
00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.156
See you, Henry.

13
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:59.354
Why the fuck do I let you drag me
out to this shit hole?

14
00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.606
You're a snob, Harry.

15
00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.693
Eleven hundred people
come through here every day.

16
00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.278
Hard to remember
two fellows passing through.

17
00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.530
Thank you.

18
00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:12.200
Of course,
people might remember them.

19
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.954
Yeah.

20
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.123
Then that kind of defeats
your purpose.

21
00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.542
I don't go anywhere without them.
Nowhere.

22
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.045
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

23
00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.548
Everything went okay?

24
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.718
It got done.

25
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.513
There's no one better than you,
you know.

26
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:37.183
That's why they give you those jobs
that could get hairy...

27
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.687
...because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it...

28
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.566
...and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

29
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.027
Fait accompli.

30
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:49.029
You're a goddamn machine.

31
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.698
You see things.

32
00:08:51.865 --> 00:08:56.244
You view people differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

33
00:08:56.411 --> 00:08:58.747
Yeah, but you've got a problem,
Arthur.

34
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.874
You need companionship.

35
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.542
I have you, Harry.

36
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.503
Oh, then you're in deeper shit
than I thought.

37
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.465
So how's Steven?

38
00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:12.260
Did I tell you that I got him a job
at a private security firm?

39
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:16.097
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

40
00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:22.103
Goddamn disappointment.

41
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.272
Always has been, always will be.

42
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.026
Call him.

43
00:09:28.193 --> 00:09:29.819
Me? Call him?

44
00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.029
For what?

45
00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.698
He probably needs
to hear from you.

46
00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:36.951
Yeah.

47
00:09:37.118 --> 00:09:39.120
Let's go. I'll get your money.

48
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:28.128
Come on. Dance with me.

49
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.006
Come on, please?

50
00:11:11.045 --> 00:11:12.672
You hungry?

51
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.800
Sure.

52
00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:32.942
I gotta go.

53
00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.570
Okay.

54
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.920
You ever gonna tell me your name?

55
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.092
Arthur.

56
00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.763
Nice try.

57
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.264
But you're no Arthur.

58
00:12:03.681 --> 00:12:07.352
No, more like a David.

59
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.729
Or Brad.

60
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:12.649
Yeah.

61
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.609
See you, Brad.

62
00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.658
Yeah, I know.

63
00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.035
Yeah.

64
00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:00.154
Global Engineering.

65
00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:02.448
I'm calling about the ad.

66
00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:03.825
There must be a mistake.

67
00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:06.077
One moment, please.

68
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:11.708
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

69
00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:14.168
I want a meeting.

70
00:13:14.877 --> 00:13:16.796
We'll get back to you.

71
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.306
Mr. Bishop,
Mr. Dean has agreed to a meeting.

72
00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:28.516
A private jet will pick you up
in one hour...

73
00:13:28.683 --> 00:13:30.810
...and deliver you to a site
of his choosing.

74
00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.731
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

75
00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:39.027
When we tell you to be home at 10:00,
we mean 10, not 11:30.

76
00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.821
I don't care, baby.
You scared your mother to death.

77
00:13:41.988 --> 00:13:45.366
You're grounded for two weeks.
Just one second.

78
00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.454
Well, that's not my problem.

79
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:51.748
All right, look.

80
00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:54.500
Ten days and you volunteer
two Saturdays at the shelter.

81
00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.879
Eight days and three Saturdays.

82
00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.214
- Nice ring.
- Done.

83
00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:01.883
Where do I get one of those?

84
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.053
You can't.
Unless you're a world champion.

85
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:07.388
Just tell him to come out
and fix it, honey.

86
00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:09.057
All right, let's go.

87
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.356
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

88
00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:19.192
Let's take a walk.

89
00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.740
Six months ago,
we were commissioned to undertake...

90
00:14:25.907 --> 00:14:28.159
...the largest contract
we've ever attempted.

91
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:32.288
The target was far more high-profile
than we're normally comfortable with...

92
00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.499
...but the job was just too rich
to pass up.

93
00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:37.585
- The target was South African?
- The target fled to South Africa.

94
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.088
That's where we made our move,
in Cape Town.

95
00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:42.256
It took six months to set up.

96
00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:46.552
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

97
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.887
All five were killed.

98
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.848
Someone knew everything.

99
00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:53.810
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

100
00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:56.437
I knew this one. Sebastian.

101
00:14:58.064 --> 00:15:00.691
You know how this company works,
Mr. Bishop.

102
00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:04.654
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

103
00:15:05.613 --> 00:15:07.407
Two people knew the details here.

104
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:10.368
Me and Harry McKenna.

105
00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.287
Harry sold us out.

106
00:15:16.457 --> 00:15:17.959
We pulled his financials.

107
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:20.711
Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

108
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:25.049
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million US dollars.

109
00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.301
He's gotten old.

110
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:28.928
He's gotten weak.

111
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:32.807
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

112
00:15:33.307 --> 00:15:35.143
They made him vulnerable.

113
00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:38.980
And for the past 13 years,
I have been fiercely loyal to him.

114
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:41.357
There's no one I respected more.

115
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.985
But Harry McKenna
has poisoned the well.

116
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:47.321
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

117
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:48.990
Let me talk to him.

118
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.493
Look, I appreciate
your connection with Harry...

119
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.954
...but there's no turning back here.

120
00:15:55.496 --> 00:15:58.124
He has crossed his Rubicon.

121
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:02.044
Every day that he's alive
puts this company in danger.

122
00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:06.340
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

123
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:07.842
Given your relationship...

124
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:11.512
...you're in the best position
to get this done quickly and discreetly.

125
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:15.933
And to be honest with you, I hate the
idea of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

126
00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:18.603
We don't wanna go
to an outside source.

127
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:20.855
But we will if we have to.

128
00:16:22.523 --> 00:16:24.275
Excuse me a sec.

129
00:16:27.361 --> 00:16:30.573
Jess, negotiations are closed.
I'm sorry.

130
00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.826
I'm in a meeting.
Okay, hang on a sec.

131
00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:40.082
Forty-eight hours
or we'll proceed without you.

132
00:16:42.043 --> 00:16:43.085
Hey, squirt?

133
00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.881
Remember the expression,
"Quit while you're ahead"?

134
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:55.640
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

135
00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:58.893
I mean,
the way he dealt with his damn chair.

136
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.021
Jasper, pull your trousers up,
will you? Please?

137
00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:03.731
Pull your trousers up.

138
00:17:03.898 --> 00:17:06.984
You know, the suits
don't really fit you guys very well.

139
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.586
- Yeah?
- Get out of the building, Harry.

140
00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:09.964
- Arthur?
- They're coming for you tonight.

141
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.882
Who? Who's coming?

142
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:13.134
Dean.

143
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.804
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

144
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.097
Oh, Jesus.

145
00:18:18.264 --> 00:18:20.057
Do you have a pair of scissors?

146
00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:21.475
Yeah.

147
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.939
- Go to the elevator lobby.
- On my way.

148
00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.617
Looks like we got a power outage
on the 18th floor.

149
00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.869
You have 15 seconds
to get to the elevator...

150
00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:41.871
...before the emergency power
comes on.

151
00:18:42.038 --> 00:18:44.332
- There's a keypad.
- Punch in the building number.

152
00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:45.625
We cut the power off.

153
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:49.045
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

154
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.297
I'm in.

155
00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:52.840
Press the basement floor.

156
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.843
The elevator will take
18 seconds to get there.

157
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:59.305
The level is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

158
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:05.603
It connects to the building next door.
It leads to an underground parking lot.

159
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.230
Shit.

160
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:13.986
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

161
00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:23.245
Okay, you should be entering
the parking lot now.

162
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:36.467
My van's here.

163
00:19:36.926 --> 00:19:39.011
I left it there.

164
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.139
Oh, shit.

165
00:19:49.355 --> 00:19:54.068
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

166
00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.821
Nobody sees me leave.

167
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.784
So, what's this?

168
00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:03.244
Cape Town, right?

169
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:06.205
Yeah. Right.

170
00:20:10.459 --> 00:20:12.753
So, what's the story here?

171
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.630
Carjacking?

172
00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:19.552
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole section of the city...

173
00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.388
...stripped and up on blocks?

174
00:20:22.555 --> 00:20:24.098
Something like that.

175
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:31.021
Well, a slight editorial revision.

176
00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:33.107
You don't mind, do you?

177
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.461
Yeah, I get off a couple of shots,
there's a struggle...

178
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:57.089
...they get my gun, c'est la vie.

179
00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:01.177
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

180
00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:06.390
I've had that for 33 years.

181
00:21:07.641 --> 00:21:11.854
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

182
00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.732
That's the first time I ever fired it.

183
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:20.237
Why didn't you kill me?

184
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:25.367
They'd just send somebody else.

185
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:30.122
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

186
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:34.126
You'll have to live with it.

187
00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:39.483
Arthur fucking Bishop.

188
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:41.735
Sorry for your loss.

189
00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:45.406
More of a loss for you than me,
buddy.

190
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:47.533
It's a long time.

191
00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:14.602
Hey, would you give me a ride
to my father's house?

192
00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.905
Your father talked about you a lot.

193
00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:29.116
He talked about spending time
with you, maybe making up.

194
00:23:29.617 --> 00:23:31.535
Give it a rest, would you?

195
00:23:31.702 --> 00:23:34.163
Yeah, well,
he was always bringing you up.

196
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.123
He had regrets, Steven.

197
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.876
Yeah, he could have picked up
the phone anytime.

198
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.477
I wanna show you something.

199
00:24:06.028 --> 00:24:08.489
I loved this place as a kid.

200
00:24:15.788 --> 00:24:17.873
It's pretty impressive, huh?

201
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:23.295
Every one of them
served their country.

202
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:27.257
I guess I could still enlist.

203
00:24:27.758 --> 00:24:29.843
You know, make him proud.

204
00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:33.430
I'm fucking with you.

205
00:24:34.181 --> 00:24:36.183
I don't know if you have
a picture of him...

206
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.394
...but I thought maybe you'd,
you know...

207
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.104
...want one.

208
00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:53.701
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around.

209
00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.285
For what?

210
00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:57.663
He didn't leave a will.

211
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.708
Accounts are empty.
Bank's gonna take the house.

212
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:04.211
By the time the lawyers, city
and state get through with the rest...

213
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.338
...not gonna be a fucking thing left.

214
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:07.548
Where you headed?

215
00:25:08.716 --> 00:25:10.718
Next place.

216
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:14.722
Need some money?

217
00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:16.974
No, thanks.

218
00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:21.562
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

219
00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:25.065
I figure that'll probably get me through
along to the next spot.

220
00:25:26.316 --> 00:25:27.568
What about the guns?

221
00:25:31.238 --> 00:25:33.198
I was thinking about going out...

222
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.410
...and killing myself
a couple carjackers tonight.

223
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.415
Just any old
run-of-the-mill carjacker.

224
00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:42.875
Yeah, well, you never know.

225
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.753
I might get lucky,
find the guys that killed my dad.

226
00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.880
It gonna make you feel better?

227
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.134
Fuck if I know.

228
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.553
But I'll find out.

229
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:07.107
Sleep it off, Steve.

230
00:26:11.445 --> 00:26:13.280
Hey, Bishop?

231
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:17.951
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

232
00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:11.630
How long am I supposed to wait?

233
00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:14.550
You know what?
You can wait until tomorrow.

234
00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:17.219
Look, I told you to be here.

235
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.979
Hey. Hey, you need some help?

236
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.860
No, I think I got it.

237
00:27:33.819 --> 00:27:38.198
I'm supposed to meet a friend and I
might have gotten the address wrong.

238
00:27:38.365 --> 00:27:40.367
Yeah. Maybe.

239
00:27:40.534 --> 00:27:44.079
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

240
00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:48.542
Nice car, man. Nice car.

241
00:27:48.709 --> 00:27:50.210
Thanks.

242
00:27:51.503 --> 00:27:54.381
- Can I have it?
- What?

243
00:27:54.548 --> 00:27:57.885
I'm relieving you of your automobile,
motherfucker.

244
00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:59.720
Out of the car.

245
00:27:59.887 --> 00:28:01.722
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

246
00:28:03.557 --> 00:28:05.893
Jesus fucking Chri-- Okay.

247
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:07.561
Okay.

248
00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:09.354
Mother--

249
00:28:14.109 --> 00:28:15.694
Carjacker.

250
00:28:19.448 --> 00:28:21.366
Did you shoot him with this?

251
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.703
- Fuck.
- Is this the gun you used?

252
00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:26.830
No?

253
00:28:59.613 --> 00:29:01.448
Hey. Bad move.

254
00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:06.203
Didn't properly think this through,
did you, Steven?

255
00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:15.087
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

256
00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:18.966
Anybody asks, you fell down.

257
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:20.968
Don't make us
come looking for you.

258
00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.928
Get out of here.

259
00:29:26.014 --> 00:29:28.433
Stupid to kill someone
when you have a motive.

260
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.270
Might as well paint
a bull's-eye on your back.

261
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:33.105
I don't give a shit.

262
00:29:33.272 --> 00:29:35.148
I'm aware.

263
00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.944
Get out of here.

264
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:35.083
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

265
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.004
And I wanna know what you know.

266
00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:41.298
Go online.

267
00:30:41.465 --> 00:30:43.467
It's all on the Internet.

268
00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:46.303
But I don't wanna read it.

269
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.221
I wanna do it.

270
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:50.515
Do what exactly?

271
00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:52.726
Bishop, don't bullshit me.

272
00:30:52.893 --> 00:30:54.353
I know about you.

273
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.396
And him.

274
00:30:56.563 --> 00:30:59.232
He was your mentor.
He chose you over me.

275
00:30:59.399 --> 00:31:01.360
You owe him.

276
00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.447
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

277
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.867
Go home, Steve.

278
00:31:35.102 --> 00:31:36.603
Still for sale.

279
00:31:37.687 --> 00:31:39.356
You know you want it.

280
00:31:39.523 --> 00:31:42.526
No other lifetime but this.

281
00:31:43.276 --> 00:31:45.278
Want some advice?

282
00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:48.281
Follow what this tells you.

283
00:31:48.698 --> 00:31:51.076
It's trying to tell you something.

284
00:31:51.785 --> 00:31:56.081
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

285
00:32:28.572 --> 00:32:31.825
8600 Alvarado Street,
7 a.m. tomorrow.

286
00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:49.676
What is this place?

287
00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:50.969
It's an animal shelter.

288
00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:53.013
Yeah, I know what it is.
Why are we here?

289
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.974
Look for a dog like this.
Under a year, if possible.

290
00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:58.810
I would have taken you more
for a cat person.

291
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:05.358
You know what a mechanic is,
outside its obvious definition?

292
00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:10.030
A guy who fixes things,
problems, has contracts.

293
00:33:10.572 --> 00:33:11.865
A hit man.

294
00:33:12.032 --> 00:33:13.658
I do assignments.

295
00:33:13.825 --> 00:33:15.368
Designated targets.

296
00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:17.287
I could do that.

297
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:19.831
- I've seen some shit.
- No, you haven't.

298
00:33:22.042 --> 00:33:24.377
You know shit about me, Bishop.

299
00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:28.340
Steven Jackson McKenna.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.

300
00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:31.718
Your mother died when you was 12.
A mixture of pain meds and vodka.

301
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:33.762
You attended three
different high schools.

302
00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:35.222
Grant, Deer Park and Monroe.

303
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:37.974
Lettered in four sports,
got a scholarship from Miami...

304
00:33:38.141 --> 00:33:41.301
...that was rescinded upon a conviction
of possession with intent to distribute.

305
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:44.356
Had misdemeanors for aggravated
assault and unlawful threats...

306
00:33:44.523 --> 00:33:46.233
...against two different girlfriends.

307
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.817
Broke your kneecap in a fight.

308
00:33:47.984 --> 00:33:50.184
Didn't wanna tell anyone,
so you let it heal on its own.

309
00:33:50.237 --> 00:33:52.072
Now, when it rains,
you walk with a limp.

310
00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:54.866
I'll show you the X-rays, if you like.

311
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.833
Our friend here
would like to adopt this little fellow.

312
00:34:05.752 --> 00:34:07.003
Hello, boy.

313
00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:20.225
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

314
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:22.602
Revenge is an emotion
that can get you killed.

315
00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:25.522
So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

316
00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:34.364
Walk it, feed it,
make it your best friend.

317
00:34:34.781 --> 00:34:37.617
Tomorrow, 11, Fischer Square.

318
00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:55.135
Take the dog
to the coffee shop on Riverdale.

319
00:34:55.635 --> 00:34:57.887
Order a coffee. Black.

320
00:34:58.054 --> 00:35:01.600
Sit at a table by the window and
do the Sudoku puzzle in the paper.

321
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.311
- Play nice with the dog.
- For how long?

322
00:35:04.477 --> 00:35:06.187
One hour.

323
00:35:06.354 --> 00:35:08.315
Every day for the next three weeks.

324
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:34.799
This is yours. This is yours.
This is yours.

325
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.357
Practice on this.

326
00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:55.570
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

327
00:35:55.737 --> 00:35:57.864
They even have books
with actuaries...

328
00:35:58.031 --> 00:36:00.950
...lists of every cause
of death imaginable.

329
00:36:01.117 --> 00:36:03.370
Why don't you just shoot them
and fuck all this?

330
00:36:03.536 --> 00:36:05.288
Good judgment
comes from experience...

331
00:36:05.455 --> 00:36:08.249
...and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.

332
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:27.060
Bed's under the boxes.

333
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:29.020
Help yourself.

334
00:36:56.673 --> 00:36:58.633
How long you been working on it?

335
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:02.846
Two years.

336
00:37:03.012 --> 00:37:04.848
It's nice.

337
00:37:05.181 --> 00:37:06.933
When are we gonna go for a ride?

338
00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:08.893
We?

339
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.353
Never.

340
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.108
Time to take your training
to the next level.

341
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.966
- Who's that?
- He's good.

342
00:37:40.133 --> 00:37:41.801
Nobody checked you out.

343
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:44.304
I could come back.

344
00:37:44.721 --> 00:37:46.765
I'd rather not stand out here.

345
00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:59.068
I gotta tell you, man.
I'm a little skittish right now.

346
00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:02.489
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

347
00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:05.909
There's a lot of shit in the wind,
you know?

348
00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:09.454
I brought the list and the money.

349
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:12.332
Now's not a good time.

350
00:38:14.459 --> 00:38:16.252
Let me see the list.

351
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.592
All this by when?

352
00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:24.344
As soon as possible.

353
00:38:24.761 --> 00:38:26.513
All right.

354
00:38:26.679 --> 00:38:28.598
Take me a day to make it happen.

355
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:31.267
Let me have the money.

356
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:14.894
- Autoerotic asphyxiation?
- Yep.

357
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.193
Just thought
you should see one up close.

358
00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.594
Don't ever touch this.

359
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.489
Follow me.

360
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:21.419
- Who was he?
- A job.

361
00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:23.546
Nothing more, nothing less.

362
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:26.299
Makes you feel better,
he was an illegal arms dealer.

363
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:32.138
Sold weapons to anyone.
Cop killers, gangbangers, terrorists.

364
00:40:32.805 --> 00:40:34.891
He didn't discriminate.

365
00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:47.153
Here's the file.

366
00:40:50.198 --> 00:40:51.658
The guy from the coffee shop?

367
00:40:53.952 --> 00:40:55.411
All yours.

368
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:58.122
You wouldn't know it
by looking at him...

369
00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.416
...but he's a mechanic
for another group.

370
00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:04.545
His only routine is coffee
every morning from 9 to 10.

371
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.298
Doesn't go anyplace twice
except here.

372
00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:10.677
He's insulated, protected.

373
00:41:10.843 --> 00:41:12.637
No way in
without him seeing us coming.

374
00:41:12.804 --> 00:41:15.848
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas--

375
00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:17.350
- Mind if I sit down?
- Please.

376
00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:20.353
--And boys. Young boys.

377
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.188
- Coffee, black.
- Thank you.

378
00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:23.856
No doubt he's checked you out...

379
00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:26.275
...and found no connection to you
and this world.

380
00:41:26.442 --> 00:41:28.945
What he sees is a good-looking kid
who's kind of lost.

381
00:41:29.112 --> 00:41:31.823
- Do you wanna hold him?
- Yeah.

382
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:34.409
- He likes that.
- Come here, baby.

383
00:41:34.575 --> 00:41:38.204
If he's interested,
the first thing he'll do is ask you.

384
00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:41.040
- So, you live around here, Steve?
- Your answer should be--

385
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:42.500
I'm bouncing around.

386
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:45.044
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

387
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:47.213
- He's my buddy.
- Yeah.

388
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.299
- Then ask you if--
- You wanna get a drink one evening?

389
00:41:50.466 --> 00:41:53.219
- Your answer should be--
- Yeah.

390
00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:55.555
Great.

391
00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:59.225
- That's great, isn't it?
- Flunitrazepam.

392
00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:00.810
Roof te.

393
00:42:01.561 --> 00:42:04.689
You want me to kill him,
not rape him, right?

394
00:42:08.234 --> 00:42:10.153
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

395
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:14.032
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

396
00:42:15.742 --> 00:42:17.869
Do it in the bar. Make it clean.

397
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:27.920
These fancy places,
they always water down the booze.

398
00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:31.466
So I think that's why
these are going down so fast.

399
00:42:32.508 --> 00:42:34.510
They don't water down wine,
that's for sure.

400
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:35.720
It's really good.

401
00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:37.055
- Want another one?
- Yeah.

402
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.307
- Jameson, right?
- Jameson, double, please.

403
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:40.725
Right.

404
00:42:49.484 --> 00:42:52.904
Don't mess around with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

405
00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.994
I wanna know what you know.
I wanna do it.

406
00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:13.633
What?

407
00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.635
- What's funny?
- No, nothing's funny.

408
00:43:15.802 --> 00:43:18.971
- I'm just, I think I've had too many.
- No, come on.

409
00:43:19.138 --> 00:43:21.099
No, I think
I'm gonna finish this one--

410
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.643
I'm gonna finish this one
and then I'm gonna--

411
00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:30.066
I really should go to bed.
But it was very-- It was fun.

412
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:40.618
Steve.

413
00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.330
Hey.

414
00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.415
- You all right?
- Yeah.

415
00:43:46.582 --> 00:43:49.085
- How are you?
- I'm good, man.

416
00:43:49.919 --> 00:43:52.213
Hey, can I give you
a ride someplace?

417
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:54.215
Car's right here.

418
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:56.425
Come on, get in.

419
00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:58.761
- I wanna show you something.
- Yeah?

420
00:43:58.928 --> 00:44:00.930
He's 6'7, 300 pounds and lethal.

421
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:03.516
Do not take this guy on.

422
00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:07.854
And whatever you do,
don't ever get into his car.

423
00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:25.830
What do you think?

424
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:28.332
It's beautiful.

425
00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:30.376
Let me get you a drink.

426
00:44:35.173 --> 00:44:36.382
You paint?

427
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.634
Yeah, it's more of a hobby, really.

428
00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:40.887
Pretty serious hobby.

429
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.975
Cheers.

430
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:49.687
That's the sitting area, the fireplace.

431
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:51.522
Chillaxing room.

432
00:44:51.689 --> 00:44:55.151
This is the place I'm most proud of,
right here.

433
00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:57.862
Who's this guy?

434
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.990
That is 14th century Buddha.

435
00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:04.994
And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

436
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:09.373
It's nice to have friends, you know,
good friends that make a difference.

437
00:45:12.293 --> 00:45:14.086
You got food friends?

438
00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:19.717
I mean, really good friends.

439
00:45:24.263 --> 00:45:26.098
You're shaking like a leaf.

440
00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:27.725
Sit down.

441
00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:47.286
All right, all right.

442
00:45:47.453 --> 00:45:49.205
Okay, let me do it.

443
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:50.623
Slow down, cowboy.

444
00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:35.287
I told you to make it clean.

445
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.382
See you later.

446
00:49:49.737 --> 00:49:51.822
Was it work or pleasure?

447
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:58.204
I wish someone
would hurt me like that.

448
00:50:47.086 --> 00:50:48.504
Hey.

449
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.923
Thanks.

450
00:50:51.215 --> 00:50:53.175
I'm gonna call him Arthur.

451
00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:42.975
Yeah.

452
00:51:43.142 --> 00:51:46.979
You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

453
00:51:47.146 --> 00:51:51.650
- That's a violation of our arrangement.
- My arrangement was with Harry.

454
00:51:51.817 --> 00:51:53.402
You and I don't have one.

455
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:56.071
Just the price.

456
00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.909
Or think someone trained by me
would be valuable to you.

457
00:52:01.076 --> 00:52:05.497
Harry McKenna's son?
Does he know you killed his father?

458
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:10.461
This job needs to be done
immediately.

459
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:13.130
The client's willing to pay
a premium for it.

460
00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:15.466
I don't think so. It's too quick.

461
00:52:15.633 --> 00:52:20.179
Your behavior is making me
and the others extremely uneasy.

462
00:52:20.596 --> 00:52:23.140
You're on a short leash
with this one.

463
00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:26.018
The file is a priority.

464
00:52:30.356 --> 00:52:32.441
I'll look it over.

465
00:53:02.346 --> 00:53:03.722
I am one with God.

466
00:53:03.889 --> 00:53:07.101
God touches me
and I touch his people.

467
00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:11.897
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old,
calls himself The New Messiah.

468
00:53:12.064 --> 00:53:14.900
- So, Reverend Vaughn--
- Just Vaughn.

469
00:53:15.067 --> 00:53:18.112
I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by any of the world religions.

470
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.280
I am above them. I am Vaughn.

471
00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:23.117
He has made millions of dollars
through his churches...

472
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:25.452
...his ministries,
his television programs.

473
00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.205
Basically, he is running a cult.

474
00:53:28.372 --> 00:53:31.917
Adrenalin shot to the heart, 12 cc's,
and he's dead in under three minutes.

475
00:53:32.084 --> 00:53:35.254
Adrenalin's unreliable.
One in four survive cardiac arrest.

476
00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.047
But when the EMTs arrive...

477
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:40.342
...the first thing they do is jam you
with a shot of epinephrine.

478
00:53:40.509 --> 00:53:43.595
- Which is toxic when combined with--
- Adrenaline.

479
00:53:43.762 --> 00:53:46.348
So in the off chance
our shot doesn't kill him--

480
00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:48.142
The EMTs will.

481
00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.693
He left a Bible study group
with a young devotee one night.

482
00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.113
They didn't find her body
until two weeks later.

483
00:54:03.949 --> 00:54:08.370
The autopsy said she had an abortion
and was telling her friends it was his.

484
00:54:08.537 --> 00:54:11.415
Cost him $22 million to hush it up.

485
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:14.126
Okay, let's get this over with.

486
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.132
Bless you. Next.

487
00:54:21.967 --> 00:54:24.219
Why don't you come sit right here?

488
00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:27.431
You're new here.

489
00:54:27.598 --> 00:54:29.308
- How long you been here?
- Two weeks.

490
00:54:29.475 --> 00:54:31.894
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

491
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:33.896
Eighteen.

492
00:55:03.675 --> 00:55:06.595
You could have found us
someone more attractive to spy on.

493
00:55:07.054 --> 00:55:08.931
He's still eating.

494
00:55:09.097 --> 00:55:10.933
Soup, salad, sandwich.

495
00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:13.602
Double chocolate cake.

496
00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.687
Bishop, I'm hungry.

497
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:24.279
The guy at the deli,
he had Band-Aids on all of his fingers.

498
00:55:24.822 --> 00:55:28.116
If you find a Band-Aid
in your sandwich, it wasn't mine.

499
00:56:13.745 --> 00:56:14.746
We're all clear.

500
00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.895
- How do you feel, Vaughn?
- How do you think I feel?

501
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:39.521
- Where's Frank?
- I sent for him.

502
00:56:39.688 --> 00:56:41.106
He should be here any minute.

503
00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.775
Speak of the devil.

504
00:56:59.791 --> 00:57:01.460
Give me something special today.

505
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:03.670
I feel like celebrating.

506
00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:09.885
I have the spirits' work to do.

507
00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:12.638
The spirits are gonna work
in your favor.

508
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.193
The guy's a junkie.

509
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:29.029
He's giving him Ketamine.

510
00:57:30.656 --> 00:57:33.367
- So?
- Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.

511
00:57:33.533 --> 00:57:34.826
This won't work now.

512
00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:51.635
I have been tapped
on the shoulder by God.

513
00:57:52.886 --> 00:57:54.680
What do you wanna do?

514
00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:58.642
I did not ask for this...

515
00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:03.313
...but my shoulder was touched
by the sword of the king.

516
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.193
And he told me to rise up.

517
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:10.988
We've gotta pack it up.

518
00:58:11.863 --> 00:58:14.533
- Wait, wait.
- If he comes back in here--

519
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:16.952
We'll be gone soon.

520
00:58:19.371 --> 00:58:21.206
Yes, hello.

521
00:58:21.373 --> 00:58:22.624
Yes, yes, it is.

522
00:58:22.791 --> 00:58:25.043
In the king's name.

523
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:26.878
- Hey.
- Get the scope.

524
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:28.839
Put it down his throat.

525
00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:30.382
Down his throat.

526
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:32.217
This will choke him.

527
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:38.807
If they think
that I'm going to pay full price...

528
00:58:38.974 --> 00:58:41.393
...for a four-bedroom in this market,
they're crazy.

529
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:45.022
Only I can tie others.

530
00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:47.899
How can I change the world?

531
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.363
How can I be a better man
for my parishioners...

532
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.949
- ...for my flock?
- Let's go.

533
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:58.160
Sometimes I wonder.

534
00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.247
Sometimes I wonder...

535
00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:06.543
...if I have the strength,
the courage.

536
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:11.965
I look at myself in the mirror
and think...

537
00:59:14.885 --> 00:59:17.512
- And then I...
- Christ.

538
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.266
- Ralph, get in here.
- What is it?

539
00:59:21.433 --> 00:59:22.851
What is it?

540
00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:27.230
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

541
00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:29.357
Motherfucker.
I knew this was gonna happen.

542
00:59:29.524 --> 00:59:30.984
Get all this shit rounded up...

543
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:33.445
...and get it out of here
as fast as you can.

544
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.334
Try and pick him up.

545
00:59:51.963 --> 00:59:53.632
Fuck.

546
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.524
Go check it out.

547
01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.169
Take it off the wall.

548
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:37.092
They're in the wall.

549
01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:44.683
Follow them.

550
01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:49.020
Cover the exits
and get me two guys on the roof now.

551
01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:10.709
There he is.

552
01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:49.372
Go that way.

553
01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.731
Stay calm
and exit through the main door.

554
01:02:57.315 --> 01:03:00.485
They're looking for two men. Get a
connecting flight out of Midway...

555
01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.321
...I'll fly out of O'Hare,
I'll meet you at the house.

556
01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:05.198
Right this way. Let's go.

557
01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:07.158
This way, folks.

558
01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:12.747
Yeah. Yeah, right.

559
01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.918
Andrew Vaughn, the controversial
and polarizing religious figure...

560
01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:19.254
...has been pronounced dead.

561
01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.716
Police are investigating the shooting
that occurred shortly thereafter.

562
01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:25.844
The perpetrators
have not been found.

563
01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.480
Attention all passengers...

564
01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:40.442
...please keep all of your belongings
with you at all times.

565
01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:42.777
Do not leave bags unattended.

566
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.659
All five were killed.

567
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.662
All five were killed.

568
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.956
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

569
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.597
Taxi.

570
01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:11.806
Terminal D?

571
01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:13.641
Next bus. Down the street.

572
01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:16.895
- Leaves in 15 minutes.
- Thanks.

573
01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:43.671
- When does this leave?
- In 15 minutes.

574
01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.928
Doesn't give us much time, then.

575
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.767
What do you want?

576
01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.438
I wanna know
what you're doing alive.

577
01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:04.275
Last time I saw you,
you had a bullet in your head.

578
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.655
What really happened
in Cape Town?

579
01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:12.367
- Where's the rest of your team?
- They're dead.

580
01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.495
Who paid you?
Was it Harry or Dean?

581
01:05:16.121 --> 01:05:19.374
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to kill the others.

582
01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.043
Told me to fake my death.
Disappear.

583
01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:24.337
You know what else he told me?

584
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:27.549
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation.

585
01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:32.720
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

586
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.391
They knew just the man for the job.

587
01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.144
Someone who could get to him.

588
01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:43.273
It's not the fact
that you killed him, is it?

589
01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.651
It's that they played you so easily.

590
01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:48.445
That's what bothers you.

591
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:50.613
Am I right?

592
01:08:28.146 --> 01:08:30.815
- Well?
- Not so good for your side.

593
01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:35.653
Those were my two best teams.
I guess I'll have to send more.

594
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:37.864
Save the fuel.

595
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.324
I'm coming for you.

596
01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:48.499
When are you gonna be home?

597
01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:49.834
I'm really hungry.

598
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.586
Where are you?

599
01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:53.671
I'm in the living room.

600
01:08:54.422 --> 01:08:57.467
- Sit down on the couch.
- Okay.

601
01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:59.594
I'm guessing you're not alone.

602
01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.930
There's a gun
down the left side cushion.

603
01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:05.266
It's loaded and the safety's off.

604
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.518
But I'm not a lefty.

605
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:10.021
Then you're gonna die.

606
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.358
All right.
I'll see you when you get here.

607
01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.870
I'll be there in five.

608
01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:40.385
- Who sent those guys?
- The man who employs me.

609
01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:44.764
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

610
01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.610
You set?

611
01:10:44.782 --> 01:10:46.576
Get in the boat.

612
01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:07.805
You ever think
about the people you've killed?

613
01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:12.977
No.

614
01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.147
You ever kill someone you know?

615
01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.113
Yes.

616
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.659
Did it feel any different?

617
01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.207
Not in the moment.

618
01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:37.835
After.

619
01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:46.260
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

620
01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.180
Kind of time to...

621
01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.684
...make peace?

622
01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:59.524
There's no peace.

623
01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:07.698
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

624
01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.456
Yes.

625
01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.793
I guess
it doesn't really matter anyway...

626
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.754
...as long as they're dead
and you're not, right?

627
01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.487
Hello, Finch.

628
01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:56.080
Oh, my God, who are you?

629
01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.876
What are you doing here?

630
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.837
Oh, God. Jesus.

631
01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:09.719
I want you to listen to me closely.

632
01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.263
I don't care who I hurt or who I kill.

633
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.098
Understand?

634
01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:19.186
No, please. No.

635
01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.772
No, no, no.

636
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.737
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I came here to find out.

637
01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:30.364
Where's Dean?

638
01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.088
It's up to you how far I go.

639
01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:49.759
Fingers.

640
01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.137
Wrist.

641
01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:56.432
Elbow.

642
01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:59.977
Jesus, John,
tell him what he wants to know.

643
01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.654
Okay, okay.

644
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.822
300 Colby Plaza.

645
01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.576
300 Colby Plaza.
That's where he is, I swear.

646
01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:26.963
Looks like you're gonna miss
a good dinner.

647
01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:32.259
My God, you're a bastard.

648
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.022
Yes.

649
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:48.317
How much was Harry's life worth?

650
01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.654
Fifty million.

651
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.366
And here's what I'm gonna do.

652
01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:59.662
Ten million wired to the bank
of your choice within 24 hours.

653
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.581
It's a good deal. You should take it.

654
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:04.709
Not interested.

655
01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:08.045
The killer grows a conscience.

656
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:11.757
I'd say that's a breach
of professional ethics, Mr. Bishop.

657
01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.720
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

658
01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:18.764
Well, it's not gonna be
So simple now.

659
01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.766
You got that right.

660
01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:24.395
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big...

661
01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:26.188
...when you look in the mirror...

662
01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.899
...your reflection's gonna
wanna shoot you in the face.

663
01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:33.029
- You won't survive that long.
- You're a fool.

664
01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.948
You think you can get to me
before I get to you?

665
01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:37.908
I already have.

666
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.666
- Where's Conference Room E?
- Floor upstairs, sir.

667
01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.544
He's in the building.
Get me the fuck out of here.

668
01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.312
- Did they find Bishop?
- Nothing yet.

669
01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:51.941
- No, no, no.
- Get off the fucking bus.

670
01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:55.152
Move. Get off the fucking bus.
Move.

671
01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:24.932
Go!

672
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.513
Back up, come on. Let's go.

673
01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:55.439
Fuck you.

674
01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.513
What's the plan now?

675
01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.307
Disappear.

676
01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:33.102
New names. New occupation.

677
01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.728
Together?

678
01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:39.149
That's up to you.

679
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.527
What are we gonna do?
We gonna whittle?

680
01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:44.989
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

681
01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.912
Want a water?

682
01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:06.760
I've always had this...

683
01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.807
...anger inside...

684
01:20:11.974 --> 01:20:15.352
...and now I feel
like I have a place to put it.

685
01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:18.814
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

686
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.698
I could always go
into business for myself.

687
01:20:28.198 --> 01:20:31.243
There are a lot of people out there
who would pay.

688
01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.663
And I think you were wrong.

689
01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:39.793
Vengeance is the mission.

690
01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:02.649
- You want anything?
- No.

691
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:23.087
Last chance.

692
01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.090
I'm good.

693
01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.884
Steven.

694
01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.765
I'm sorry
for everything that happened.

695
01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.685
Well, you know me, man.

696
01:21:38.852 --> 01:21:40.896
I don't give a shit.

697
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.164
All four cameras.

698
01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:31.126
- Watch number two.
- Okay.

699
01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.088
- Yeah. This one here.
- Yeah.
