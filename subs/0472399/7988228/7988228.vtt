00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:04.029
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

2
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.864
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

3
00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.785
I do assignments...

4
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.580
...designated targets.

5
00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:15.499
Some jobs
need to look like accidents.

6
00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:16.917
Some jobs
need to look like accidents.

7
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:20.462
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

8
00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:21.463
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

9
00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:22.714
Others must cast suspicion
on someone else.

10
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:28.762
A select few
need to send a clear message.

11
00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:29.763
A select few
need to send a clear message.

12
00:06:29.763 --> 00:06:30.889
A select few
need to send a clear message.

13
00:06:34.935 --> 00:06:36.436
Pulling a trigger is easy.

14
00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.899
The best jobs are the ones
nobody even knows you were there.

15
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.900
The best jobs are the ones
nobody even knows you were there.

16
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.901
The best jobs are the ones
nobody even knows you were there.

17
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.985
The best jobs are the ones
nobody even knows you were there.

18
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.931
Liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night.

19
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:13.474
Liquor fairy paid me
a visit last night.

20
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:15.392
Left me a big old bottle of Scotch.

21
00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:16.559
Left me a big old bottle of Scotch.

22
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.021
He even sprung for the good stuff.

23
00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.692
See you, Henry.

24
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:52.012
Why the fuck do I let you drag me
out to this shit hole?

25
00:07:52.012 --> 00:07:53.013
Why the fuck do I let you drag me
out to this shit hole?

26
00:07:53.013 --> 00:07:54.848
Why the fuck do I let you drag me
out to this shit hole?

27
00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:56.016
You're a snob, Harry.

28
00:07:56.016 --> 00:07:57.142
You're a snob, Harry.

29
00:07:57.393 --> 00:07:58.394
Eleven hundred people
come through here every day.

30
00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:00.229
Eleven hundred people
come through here every day.

31
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:01.522
Hard to remember
two fellows passing through.

32
00:08:01.522 --> 00:08:02.731
Hard to remember
two fellows passing through.

33
00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.024
Thank you.

34
00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:07.653
Of course,
people might remember them.

35
00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:11.573
Yeah.

36
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.701
Then that kind of defeats
your purpose.

37
00:08:13.784 --> 00:08:14.785
I don't go anywhere without them.
Nowhere.

38
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.077
I don't go anywhere without them.
Nowhere.

39
00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:17.329
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

40
00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:18.330
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

41
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.706
Try to get them shoes that fit.
They look like cartoons.

42
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:22.042
Everything went okay?

43
00:08:23.585 --> 00:08:25.253
It got done.

44
00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:29.049
There's no one better than you,
you know.

45
00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.010
That's why they give you those jobs
that could get hairy...

46
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.594
That's why they give you those jobs
that could get hairy...

47
00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:33.846
...because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it...

48
00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:34.847
...because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it...

49
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.223
...because if they were to get hairy,
then you would take care of it...

50
00:08:36.515 --> 00:08:37.516
...and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

51
00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:38.517
...and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

52
00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.185
...and that's all they care about,
services rendered, no loose ends.

53
00:08:40.394 --> 00:08:42.145
Fait accompli.

54
00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:43.689
You're a goddamn machine.

55
00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:44.731
You're a goddamn machine.

56
00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:47.275
You see things.

57
00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:48.527
You view people differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

58
00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:49.528
You view people differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

59
00:08:49.528 --> 00:08:50.529
You view people differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

60
00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:51.738
You view people differently than I do,
differently than anybody does.

61
00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:52.906
Yeah, but you've got a problem,
Arthur.

62
00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:54.407
Yeah, but you've got a problem,
Arthur.

63
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.535
You need companionship.

64
00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:58.078
I have you, Harry.

65
00:08:58.287 --> 00:08:59.288
Oh, then you're in deeper shit
than I thought.

66
00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.081
Oh, then you're in deeper shit
than I thought.

67
00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:04.042
So how's Steven?

68
00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:05.252
Did I tell you that I got him a job
at a private security firm?

69
00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:06.253
Did I tell you that I got him a job
at a private security firm?

70
00:09:06.253 --> 00:09:07.754
Did I tell you that I got him a job
at a private security firm?

71
00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.048
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

72
00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:10.049
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

73
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.800
They kicked him out last month.
He beat some guy half to death.

74
00:09:15.387 --> 00:09:17.347
Goddamn disappointment.

75
00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:19.767
Always has been, always will be.

76
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.478
Call him.

77
00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.480
Me? Call him?

78
00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.565
For what?

79
00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.733
He probably needs
to hear from you.

80
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.317
He probably needs
to hear from you.

81
00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:32.654
Yeah.

82
00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:34.907
Let's go. I'll get your money.

83
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:23.955
Come on. Dance with me.

84
00:10:25.874 --> 00:10:27.792
Come on, please?

85
00:11:06.707 --> 00:11:08.208
You hungry?

86
00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.378
Sure.

87
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.603
I gotta go.

88
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.189
Okay.

89
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.371
You ever gonna tell me your name?

90
00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:47.580
You ever gonna tell me your name?

91
00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:53.795
Arthur.

92
00:11:55.881 --> 00:11:57.382
Nice try.

93
00:11:57.591 --> 00:11:58.758
But you're no Arthur.

94
00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:00.302
No, more like a David.

95
00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:01.303
No, more like a David.

96
00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:02.929
No, more like a David.

97
00:12:03.597 --> 00:12:05.390
Or Brad.

98
00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:08.267
Yeah.

99
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:10.228
See you, Brad.

100
00:12:15.609 --> 00:12:17.277
Yeah, I know.

101
00:12:17.819 --> 00:12:19.779
Yeah.

102
00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:55.816
Global Engineering.

103
00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:56.900
I'm calling about the ad.

104
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.026
I'm calling about the ad.

105
00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.528
There must be a mistake.

106
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.822
One moment, please.

107
00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:04.616
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

108
00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:05.617
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

109
00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:07.452
The advertisement was proofed.
The information is accurate.

110
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.704
I want a meeting.

111
00:13:10.664 --> 00:13:12.499
We'll get back to you.

112
00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.549
Mr. Bishop,
Mr. Dean has agreed to a meeting.

113
00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.716
Mr. Bishop,
Mr. Dean has agreed to a meeting.

114
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:22.968
A private jet will pick you up
in one hour...

115
00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.010
A private jet will pick you up
in one hour...

116
00:13:24.219 --> 00:13:25.220
...and deliver you to a site
of his choosing.

117
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.346
...and deliver you to a site
of his choosing.

118
00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:27.556
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

119
00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:28.557
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

120
00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:30.308
You'll be allowed 15 minutes.
The jet will then return you.

121
00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:31.810
When we tell you to be home at 10:00,
we mean 10, not 11:30.

122
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.811
When we tell you to be home at 10:00,
we mean 10, not 11:30.

123
00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.646
When we tell you to be home at 10:00,
we mean 10, not 11:30.

124
00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:35.897
I don't care, baby.
You scared your mother to death.

125
00:13:35.897 --> 00:13:37.398
I don't care, baby.
You scared your mother to death.

126
00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:38.650
You're grounded for two weeks.
Just one second.

127
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.651
You're grounded for two weeks.
Just one second.

128
00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:40.860
You're grounded for two weeks.
Just one second.

129
00:13:41.528 --> 00:13:42.529
Well, that's not my problem.

130
00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:43.530
Well, that's not my problem.

131
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.989
Well, that's not my problem.

132
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:47.367
All right, look.

133
00:13:47.534 --> 00:13:48.535
Ten days and you volunteer
two Saturdays at the shelter.

134
00:13:48.535 --> 00:13:50.036
Ten days and you volunteer
two Saturdays at the shelter.

135
00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:52.039
Eight days and three Saturdays.

136
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:53.498
Eight days and three Saturdays.

137
00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:55.709
-Nice ring.
-Done.

138
00:13:55.876 --> 00:13:57.502
Where do I get one of those?

139
00:13:57.711 --> 00:13:58.712
You can't.
Unless you're a world champion.

140
00:13:58.712 --> 00:14:00.338
You can't.
Unless you're a world champion.

141
00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:01.423
Just tell him to come out
and fix it, honey.

142
00:14:01.423 --> 00:14:02.882
Just tell him to come out
and fix it, honey.

143
00:14:03.091 --> 00:14:04.717
All right, let's go.

144
00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:09.723
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

145
00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:10.724
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

146
00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:11.891
I've just been out-negotiated
by a 16 year old.

147
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.686
Let's take a walk.

148
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:19.691
Six months ago,
we were commissioned to undertake...

149
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:21.401
Six months ago,
we were commissioned to undertake...

150
00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:22.569
...the largest contract
we've ever attempted.

151
00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:23.611
...the largest contract
we've ever attempted.

152
00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:24.863
The target was far more high-profile
than we're normally comfortable with...

153
00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:25.864
The target was far more high-profile
than we're normally comfortable with...

154
00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:27.782
The target was far more high-profile
than we're normally comfortable with...

155
00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:29.034
...but the job was just too rich
to pass up.

156
00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.076
...but the job was just too rich
to pass up.

157
00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:31.244
-The target was South African?
-The target fled to South Africa.

158
00:14:31.244 --> 00:14:33.204
-The target was South African?
-The target fled to South Africa.

159
00:14:33.413 --> 00:14:34.414
That's where we made our move,
in Cape Town.

160
00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:35.581
That's where we made our move,
in Cape Town.

161
00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:37.751
It took six months to set up.

162
00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:38.960
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

163
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.961
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

164
00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:41.837
I assigned a team of five operatives
to work in concert on the mission.

165
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.548
All five were Killed.

166
00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:45.384
Someone knew everything.

167
00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.468
Someone knew everything.

168
00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:47.803
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

169
00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:49.429
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

170
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:50.722
I knew this one. Sebastian.

171
00:14:50.722 --> 00:14:52.056
I knew this one. Sebastian.

172
00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:54.768
You know how this company works,
Mr. Bishop.

173
00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:56.311
You know how this company works,
Mr. Bishop.

174
00:14:56.561 --> 00:14:57.562
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

175
00:14:57.562 --> 00:14:58.563
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

176
00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:00.273
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

177
00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.943
Two people knew the details here.

178
00:15:03.151 --> 00:15:04.152
Me and Harry McKenna.

179
00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:05.945
Me and Harry McKenna.

180
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.781
Harry sold us out.

181
00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:08.823
Harry sold us out.

182
00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.661
We pulled his financials.

183
00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:14.955
Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

184
00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.331
Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

185
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.291
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million U.S. dollars.

186
00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:19.292
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million U.S. dollars.

187
00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:20.793
There's one there made two weeks
ago for 20 million U.S. dollars.

188
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.921
He's gotten old.

189
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.631
He's gotten weak.

190
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.841
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

191
00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:26.842
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

192
00:15:26.842 --> 00:15:28.468
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his costly, troubled son.

193
00:15:28.927 --> 00:15:30.929
They made him vulnerable.

194
00:15:31.304 --> 00:15:32.305
And for the past 13 years,
I have been fiercely loyal to him.

195
00:15:32.305 --> 00:15:33.306
And for the past 13 years,
I have been fiercely loyal to him.

196
00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:34.640
And for the past 13 years,
I have been fiercely loyal to him.

197
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:35.809
There's no one I respected more.

198
00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:36.976
There's no one I respected more.

199
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:39.146
But Harry McKenna
has poisoned the well.

200
00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:40.689
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

201
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:41.690
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

202
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.857
He needs to be removed.
Immediately.

203
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.776
Let me talk to him.

204
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.111
Look, I appreciate
your connection with Harry...

205
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:48.113
Look, I appreciate
your connection with Harry...

206
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:49.322
...but there's no turning back here.

207
00:15:49.322 --> 00:15:50.656
...but there's no turning back here.

208
00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.159
He has crossed his Rubicon.

209
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.368
He has crossed his Rubicon.

210
00:15:53.869 --> 00:15:54.870
Every day that he's alive
puts this company in danger.

211
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.871
Every day that he's alive
puts this company in danger.

212
00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.831
Every day that he's alive
puts this company in danger.

213
00:15:58.832 --> 00:15:59.833
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

214
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:00.834
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

215
00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:01.960
I know we would all prefer
that you handle this.

216
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:03.628
Given your relationship...

217
00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:04.838
...you're in the best position
to get this done quickly and discreetly.

218
00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.839
...you're in the best position
to get this done quickly and discreetly.

219
00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.173
...you're in the best position
to get this done quickly and discreetly.

220
00:16:07.382 --> 00:16:08.383
And to be honest with you, I hate the
idea of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

221
00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:09.384
And to be honest with you, I hate the
idea of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

222
00:16:09.384 --> 00:16:10.385
And to be honest with you, I hate the
idea of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

223
00:16:10.385 --> 00:16:11.677
And to be honest with you, I hate the
idea of Harry suffering unnecessarily.

224
00:16:12.012 --> 00:16:13.013
We don't wanna go
to an outside source.

225
00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:14.305
We don't wanna go
to an outside source.

226
00:16:14.514 --> 00:16:15.515
But we will if we have to.

227
00:16:15.515 --> 00:16:16.641
But we will if we have to.

228
00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:19.853
Excuse me a sec.

229
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:24.024
Jess, negotiations are closed.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.025
Jess, negotiations are closed.
I'm sorry.

231
00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:26.234
Jess, negotiations are closed.
I'm sorry.

232
00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:27.694
I'm in a meeting.
Okay, hang on a sec.

233
00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.570
I'm in a meeting.
Okay, hang on a sec.

234
00:16:31.698 --> 00:16:32.699
Forty-eight hours
or we'll proceed without you.

235
00:16:32.699 --> 00:16:33.700
Forty-eight hours
or we'll proceed without you.

236
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.701
Forty-eight hours
or we'll proceed without you.

237
00:16:34.701 --> 00:16:35.910
Forty-eight hours
or we'll proceed without you.

238
00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:38.746
Hey, squirt?

239
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:39.873
Remember the expression,
Quit while you're ahead?

240
00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:40.874
Remember the expression,
Quit while you're ahead?

241
00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:42.709
Remember the expression,
Quit while you're ahead?

242
00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.005
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

243
00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.006
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

244
00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:49.007
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

245
00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:50.008
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

246
00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:51.217
Yeah, I mean,
Roosevelt, to be truthful, is my hero.

247
00:16:51.718 --> 00:16:52.719
I mean,
the way he dealt with his damn chair.

248
00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:54.554
I mean,
the way he dealt with his damn chair.

249
00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:55.764
Jasper, pull your trousers up,
will you? Please?

250
00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.599
Jasper, pull your trousers up,
will you? Please?

251
00:16:57.682 --> 00:16:59.266
Pull your trousers up.

252
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:00.560
You know, the suits
don't really fit you guys very well.

253
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.561
You know, the suits
don't really fit you guys very well.

254
00:17:01.561 --> 00:17:02.687
You know, the suits
don't really fit you guys very well.

255
00:17:59.744 --> 00:18:00.745
-Yeah?
-Get out of the building, Harry.

256
00:18:00.745 --> 00:18:02.163
-Yeah?
-Get out of the building, Harry.

257
00:18:02.747 --> 00:18:03.748
-Arthur?
-They're coming for you tonight.

258
00:18:03.748 --> 00:18:05.458
-Arthur?
-They're coming for you tonight.

259
00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:07.627
Who? Who's coming?

260
00:18:07.794 --> 00:18:08.920
Dean.

261
00:18:09.504 --> 00:18:10.505
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

262
00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:11.797
Take whatever you can use
against them and get out.

263
00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.299
Oh, Jesus.

264
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.551
Do you have a pair of scissors?

265
00:18:15.802 --> 00:18:17.136
Yeah.

266
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.433
-Go to the elevator lobby.
-On my way.

267
00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:22.642
-Go to the elevator lobby.
-On my way.

268
00:18:30.817 --> 00:18:31.818
Looks like we got a power outage
on the 18th floor.

269
00:18:31.818 --> 00:18:33.277
Looks like we got a power outage
on the 18th floor.

270
00:18:33.486 --> 00:18:34.487
You have 15 seconds
to get to the elevator...

271
00:18:34.487 --> 00:18:35.613
You have 15 seconds
to get to the elevator...

272
00:18:35.822 --> 00:18:37.615
...before the emergency power
comes on.

273
00:18:37.824 --> 00:18:38.825
-There's a keypad.
-Punch in the building number.

274
00:18:38.825 --> 00:18:39.951
-There's a keypad.
-Punch in the building number.

275
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.286
We cut the power off.

276
00:18:41.494 --> 00:18:42.495
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

277
00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:43.496
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

278
00:18:43.496 --> 00:18:44.830
Service elevators have to work
on a separate power source.

279
00:18:45.373 --> 00:18:46.874
I'm in.

280
00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:48.626
Press the basement floor.

281
00:18:49.002 --> 00:18:50.003
The elevator will take
18 seconds to get there.

282
00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:51.629
The elevator will take
18 seconds to get there.

283
00:18:52.172 --> 00:18:53.173
The level is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

284
00:18:53.173 --> 00:18:54.883
The level is empty and unused.
Take the ramp.

285
00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:57.010
It connects to the building next door.
It leads to an underground parking lot.

286
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.011
It connects to the building next door.
It leads to an underground parking lot.

287

288
00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:00.013
It connects to the building next door.
It leads to an underground parking lot.

289
00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:01.305
It connects to the building next door.
It leads to an underground parking lot.

290
00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:03.850
Shit.

291
00:19:05.018 --> 00:19:06.019
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

292
00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:07.020
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

293
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.021
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

294
00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:09.731
Security cameras haven't been fitted
in this building yet, so they'll be blind.

295
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.030
Okay, you should be entering
the parking lot now.

296
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.865
Okay, you should be entering
the parking lot now.

297
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.878
My van's here.

298
00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:33.463
I left it there.

299
00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:34.547
I left it there.

300
00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.174
Oh, shit.

301
00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:37.717
Oh, shit.

302
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:45.767
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

303
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:46.768
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

304
00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:47.769
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

305
00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:49.645
Well, you got me to circumvent
my own security.

306
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.356
Nobody sees me leave.

307
00:19:55.276 --> 00:19:56.277
So, what's this?

308
00:19:56.277 --> 00:19:57.319
So, what's this?

309
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:58.655
Cape Town, right?

310
00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:00.407
Yeah. Right.

311
00:20:00.407 --> 00:20:01.908
Yeah. Right.

312
00:20:05.912 --> 00:20:06.913
So, what's the story here?

313
00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:08.247
So, what's the story here?

314
00:20:08.456 --> 00:20:10.124
Carjacking?

315
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:11.334
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole section of the city...

316
00:20:11.334 --> 00:20:12.335
Police will find my van somewhere
in some shit hole section of the city...

317

319
00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:16.256
...stripped and up on blocks?

320
00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:17.799
...stripped and up on blocks?

321
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:19.717
Something like that.

322
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.095
Well, a slight editorial revision.

323
00:20:22.095 --> 00:20:23.096
Well, a slight editorial revision.

324
00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:24.097

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:26.307
Well, a slight editorial revision.

327
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:27.600
You don't mind, do you?

328
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.767
You don't mind, do you?

329
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:32.981
"AMAT VICTORIA CURAM"

330
00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:33.982
"AMAT VICTORIA CURAM"

331
00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:35.108
"AMAT VICTORIA CURAM"

332
00:20:45.952 --> 00:20:46.953
Yeah, I get off a couple of shots,
there's a struggle...

333
00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:48.955
Yeah, I get off a couple of shots,
there's a struggle...

334
00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:50.165
...they get my gun, c'est la vie.

335
00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:51.166
...they get my gun, c'est la vie.

336
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.709
...they get my gun, c'est la vie.

337
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:54.502
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

338
00:20:54.502 --> 00:20:55.503
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

339
00:20:55.503 --> 00:20:56.629
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

340
00:20:59.174 --> 00:21:00.175
I've had that for 33 years.

341
00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.885
I've had that for 33 years.

342
00:21:03.219 --> 00:21:04.220
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

343
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.221
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

344
00:21:05.221 --> 00:21:06.222
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

345
00:21:06.222 --> 00:21:07.473
Gift from Admiral Beasley.
Sixth Fleet.

346
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:10.309
That's the first time I ever fired it.

347
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.690
Why didn't you kill me?

348
00:21:18.485 --> 00:21:19.486
They'd just send somebody else.

349
00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:20.862
They'd just send somebody else.

350
00:21:22.655 --> 00:21:23.656
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

351
00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:24.657
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

352
00:21:24.657 --> 00:21:25.824
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

353
00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.829
You'll have to live with it.

354
00:22:33.434 --> 00:22:34.893
Arthur fucking Bishop.

355
00:22:35.603 --> 00:22:37.229
Sorry for your loss.

356
00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:38.898
More of a loss for you than me,
buddy.

357
00:22:38.898 --> 00:22:40.816
More of a loss for you than me,
buddy.

358
00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:42.985
It's a long time.

359
00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:08.136
Hey, would you give me a ride
to my father's house?

360
00:23:08.136 --> 00:23:10.096
Hey, would you give me a ride
to my father's house?

361
00:23:18.438 --> 00:23:19.439
Your father talked about you a lot.

362
00:23:19.439 --> 00:23:20.440
Your father talked about you a lot.

363
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.482
Your father talked about you a lot.

364
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.901
He talked about spending time
with you, maybe making up.

365
00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.736
He talked about spending time
with you, maybe making up.

366
00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:27.029
Give it a rest, would you?

367
00:23:27.238 --> 00:23:28.239
Yeah, well,
he was always bringing you up.

368
00:23:28.239 --> 00:23:29.573
Yeah, well,
he was always bringing you up.

369
00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:31.617
He had regrets, Steven.

370
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:32.744
Yeah, he could have picked up
the phone anytime.

371
00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.454
Yeah, he could have picked up
the phone anytime.

372
00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:50.929
I wanna show you something.

373
00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:51.971
I wanna show you something.

374
00:24:01.689 --> 00:24:02.690
I loved this place as a kid.

375
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.024
I loved this place as a kid.

376
00:24:11.407 --> 00:24:12.408
It's pretty impressive, huh?

377
00:24:12.408 --> 00:24:13.492
It's pretty impressive, huh?

378
00:24:15.244 --> 00:24:16.245
Every one of them
served their country.

379
00:24:16.245 --> 00:24:17.246
Every one of them
served their country.

380
00:24:17.246 --> 00:24:18.789
Every one of them
served their country.

381
00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:21.125
I guess I could still enlist.

382
00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:22.751
I guess I could still enlist.

383
00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:24.379
You know, make him proud.

384
00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:25.505
You know, make him proud.

385
00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:28.966
I'm fucking with you.

386
00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:31.678
I don't know if you have
a picture of him...

387
00:24:31.886 --> 00:24:32.887
...but I thought maybe you'd,
you know...

388
00:24:32.887 --> 00:24:33.929
...but I thought maybe you'd,
you know...

389
00:24:34.138 --> 00:24:35.806
...want one.

390
00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:47.652
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around.

391
00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:49.153
Looks like you're not planning
on sticking around.

392
00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:50.654
For what?

393
00:24:51.197 --> 00:24:53.115
He didn't leave a will.

394
00:24:53.324 --> 00:24:54.325
Accounts are empty.
Bank's gonna take the house.

395
00:24:54.325 --> 00:24:56.160
Accounts are empty.
Bank's gonna take the house.

396
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.662
By the time the lawyers, city
and state get through with the rest...

397
00:24:57.662 --> 00:24:59.580
By the time the lawyers, city
and state get through with the rest...

398
00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:01.707
...not gonna be a fucking thing left.

399
00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:03.000
Where you headed?

400
00:25:04.168 --> 00:25:06.170
Next place.

401
00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:10.174
Need some money?

402
00:25:10.383 --> 00:25:11.384
No, thanks.

403
00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:12.510
No, thanks.

404
00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.512
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

405
00:25:14.512 --> 00:25:15.513
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

406
00:25:15.513 --> 00:25:16.972
I got a guy coming to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

407
00:25:17.223 --> 00:25:18.224
I figure that'll probably get me through
along to the next spot.

408
00:25:18.224 --> 00:25:19.225
I figure that'll probably get me through
along to the next spot.

409
00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:20.643
I figure that'll probably get me through
along to the next spot.

410
00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:23.020
What about the guns?

411
00:25:26.607 --> 00:25:28.567
I was thinking about going out...

412
00:25:28.776 --> 00:25:29.777
...and Killing myself
a couple carjackers tonight.

413
00:25:29.777 --> 00:25:30.778
...and Killing myself
a couple carjackers tonight.

414
00:25:30.778 --> 00:25:31.862
...and Killing myself
a couple carjackers tonight.

415
00:25:34.115 --> 00:25:35.116
Just any old
run-of-the-mill carjacker.

416
00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:36.867
Just any old
run-of-the-mill carjacker.

417
00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:38.410
Yeah, well, you never know.

418
00:25:38.619 --> 00:25:39.620
I might get lucky,
find the guys that killed my dad.

419
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.246
I might get lucky,
find the guys that killed my dad.

420
00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:43.416
It gonna make you feel better?

421
00:25:45.585 --> 00:25:46.586
Fuck if I know.

422
00:25:46.586 --> 00:25:47.753
Fuck if I know.

423
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:50.006
But I'll find out.

424
00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:02.769
Sleep it off, Steve.

425
00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:08.733
Hey, Bishop?

426
00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.069
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

427
00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:12.070
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

428
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.571
What kind of person shoots someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

429
00:27:05.665 --> 00:27:07.208
How long am I supposed to wait?

430
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.417
You know what?
You can wait until tomorrow.

431
00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:10.127
You know what?
You can wait until tomorrow.

432
00:27:10.336 --> 00:27:11.337
Look, I told you to be here.

433
00:27:11.337 --> 00:27:12.713
Look, I told you to be here.

434
00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:20.805
Hey. Hey, you need some help?

435
00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:22.640
Hey. Hey, you need some help?

436
00:27:25.601 --> 00:27:26.602
No, I think I got it.

437
00:27:26.602 --> 00:27:28.478
No, I think I got it.

438
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.481
I'm supposed to meet a friend and I
might have gotten the address wrong.

439
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:31.482
I'm supposed to meet a friend and I
might have gotten the address wrong.

440
00:27:31.482 --> 00:27:32.483
I'm supposed to meet a friend and I
might have gotten the address wrong.

441
00:27:32.483 --> 00:27:33.734
I'm supposed to meet a friend and I
might have gotten the address wrong.

442
00:27:33.943 --> 00:27:35.903
Yeah. Maybe.

443
00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.155
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

444
00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.156
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

445
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.824
Well, maybe the address
got me wrong.

446
00:27:42.034 --> 00:27:43.035
Nice car, man. Nice car.

447
00:27:43.035 --> 00:27:44.119
Nice car, man. Nice car.

448
00:27:44.328 --> 00:27:45.704
Thanks.

449
00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:48.082
-Can I have it?
-What?

450
00:27:48.082 --> 00:27:49.917
-Can I have it?
-What?

451
00:27:50.126 --> 00:27:51.127
I'm relieving you of your automobile,
motherfucker.

452
00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:52.128
I'm relieving you of your automobile,
motherfucker.

453
00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:53.587
I'm relieving you of your automobile,
motherfucker.

454
00:27:53.796 --> 00:27:55.339
Out of the car.

455
00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:57.341
-Seriously?
-Seriously.

456
00:27:59.135 --> 00:28:00.136
Jesus fucking Chri-- Okay.

457
00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:01.595
Jesus fucking Chri-- Okay.

458
00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:03.180
Okay.

459
00:28:03.431 --> 00:28:04.890
Mother--

460
00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:11.355
Carjacker.

461
00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:16.943
Did you shoot him with this?

462
00:28:17.987 --> 00:28:18.988
-Fuck.
-Is this the gun you used?

463
00:28:18.988 --> 00:28:20.364
-Fuck.
-Is this the gun you used?

464
00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:22.533
No?

465
00:28:55.274 --> 00:28:57.067
Hey. Bad move.

466
00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:00.238
Didn't properly think this through,
did you, Steven?

467
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:01.781
Didn't properly think this through,
did you, Steven?

468
00:29:05.117 --> 00:29:06.118
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

469
00:29:06.118 --> 00:29:07.119
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

470
00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:08.120
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

471
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.121
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

472
00:29:09.121 --> 00:29:10.872
This may not seem like it, but
tonight's your lucky night, Raymond.

473
00:29:13.042 --> 00:29:14.376
Anybody asks, you fell down.

474
00:29:14.752 --> 00:29:16.420
Don't make us
come looking for you.

475
00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.714
Get out of here.

476
00:29:21.842 --> 00:29:22.843
Stupid to kill someone
when you have a motive.

477
00:29:22.843 --> 00:29:24.094
Stupid to kill someone
when you have a motive.

478
00:29:24.303 --> 00:29:25.304
Might as well paint
a bull's-eye on your back.

479
00:29:25.304 --> 00:29:26.888
Might as well paint
a bull's-eye on your back.

480
00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.432
I don't give a shit.

481
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:29.892
I'm aware.

482
00:29:29.892 --> 00:29:30.976
I'm aware.

483
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:34.730
Get out of here.

484
00:30:27.575 --> 00:30:28.576
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

485
00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:29.577
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

486
00:30:29.577 --> 00:30:30.619
I was thinking about what you
were saying the other night.

487
00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:31.704
And I wanna know what you know.

488
00:30:31.704 --> 00:30:32.705
And I wanna know what you know.

489
00:30:32.705 --> 00:30:34.623
And I wanna know what you know.

490
00:30:35.207 --> 00:30:36.833
Go online.

491
00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:39.045
It's all on the Internet.

492
00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:41.839
But I don't wanna read it.

493
00:30:42.048 --> 00:30:43.758
I wanna do it.

494
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.093
Do what exactly?

495
00:30:46.302 --> 00:30:47.303
Bishop, don't bullshit me.

496
00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:48.345
Bishop, don't bullshit me.

497
00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:49.930
I know about you.

498
00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:51.974
And him.

499
00:30:52.224 --> 00:30:53.225
He was your mentor.
He chose you over me.

500
00:30:53.225 --> 00:30:54.726
He was your mentor.
He chose you over me.

501
00:30:54.977 --> 00:30:56.937
You owe him.

502
00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:58.147
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

503
00:30:58.147 --> 00:30:59.148
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

504
00:30:59.148 --> 00:31:01.066
Now that he's gone, he's left me with
fucking nothing. You owe me now.

505
00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:04.570
Go home, Steve.

506
00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:32.097
Still for sale.

507
00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:34.891
You know you want it.

508
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:36.102
No other lifetime but this.

509
00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:38.104
No other lifetime but this.

510
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:40.773
Want some advice?

511
00:31:41.732 --> 00:31:42.733
Follow what this tells you.

512
00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:43.775
Follow what this tells you.

513
00:31:44.276 --> 00:31:45.277
It's trying to tell you something.

514
00:31:45.277 --> 00:31:46.778
It's trying to tell you something.

515
00:31:47.446 --> 00:31:48.447
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

516
00:31:48.447 --> 00:31:49.448
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

517
00:31:49.448 --> 00:31:50.449
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

518
00:31:50.449 --> 00:31:51.783
It's telling you you're homesick
for a place you've never been.

519
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.151

8600 Alvarado Street,
7 a.m. tomorrow.

522
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.253
What is this place?

523
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.630
It's an animal shelter.

524
00:32:46.839 --> 00:32:48.757
Yeah, I know what it is.
Why are we here?

525
00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:49.842
Look for a dog like this.
Under a year, if possible.

526
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.635
Look for a dog like this.
Under a year, if possible.

527
00:32:51.844 --> 00:32:52.845
I would have taken you more
for a cat person.

528
00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:54.429
I would have taken you more
for a cat person.

529
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.101
You know what a mechanic is,
outside its obvious definition?

530
00:32:59.101 --> 00:33:00.852
You know what a mechanic is,
outside its obvious definition?

531
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:02.771
A guy who fixes things,
problems, has contracts.

532
00:33:02.771 --> 00:33:03.772

A guy who fixes things,
problems, has contracts.

534
00:33:06.192 --> 00:33:07.526
A hit man.

535
00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:09.236
I do assignments.

536
00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.905
Designated targets.

537
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.823
I could do that.

538
00:33:13.407 --> 00:33:14.408
-I've seen some shit.
-No, you haven't.

539
00:33:14.408 --> 00:33:15.492
-I've seen some shit.
-No, you haven't.

540
00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:18.746
You know shit about me, Bishop.

541
00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:19.955
You know shit about me, Bishop.

You attended three
different high schools.

549
00:33:29.632 --> 00:33:30.758
Grant, Deer Park and Monroe.

550
00:33:30.966 --> 00:33:31.967
Lettered in four sports,
got a scholarship from Miami...

551
00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:33.677
Lettered in four sports,
got a scholarship from Miami...

552
00:33:33.886 --> 00:33:34.887
...that was rescinded upon a conviction
of possession with intent to distribute.

553
00:33:34.887 --> 00:33:36.805

assault and unlawful threats...

556
00:33:40.142 --> 00:33:41.810
...against two different girlfriends.

557
00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.395
Broke your kneecap in a fight.

558
00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:44.563
Didn't wanna tell anyone,
so you let it heal on its own.

559
00:33:44.563 --> 00:33:45.605
Didn't wanna tell anyone,
so you let it heal on its own.

560
00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:47.566
Now, when it rains,
you walk with a limp.

561
00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:48.817
I'll show you the x-rays, if you like.

562
00:33:48.817 --> 00:33:50.568
I'll show you the x-rays, if you like.

563
00:33:55.824 --> 00:33:56.825

566
00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:02.747
Hello, boy.

567
00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:14.218
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

568
00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.802
What I do
requires a certain mindset.

569
00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:17.012
Revenge is an emotion
that can get you killed.

570
00:34:17.012 --> 00:34:18.263
Revenge is an emotion
that can get you killed.

571
00:34:18.472 --> 00:34:19.473
So no more stupid stunts
like the other night.

572
00:34:19.473 --> 00:34:21.183

00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:53.673
Order a coffee. Black.

581
00:34:53.882 --> 00:34:54.883
Sit at a table by the window and
do the Sudoku puzzle in the paper.

582
00:34:54.883 --> 00:34:55.884
Sit at a table by the window and

583
00:34:55.884 --> 00:34:57.302
Sit at a table by the window and
do the Sudoku puzzle in the paper.

584
00:34:57.511 --> 00:34:58.512
-Play nice with the dog.
-For how long?

585
00:34:58.512 --> 00:34:59.971
-Play nice with the dog.
-For how long?

586
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.806
One hour.

587
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:03.976
Every day for the next three weeks.

588
00:35:27.499 --> 00:35:28.500
This is yours. This is yours.
This is yours.

589
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.501
This is yours. This is yours.
This is yours.

590
00:35:29.501 --> 00:35:30.585
This is yours. This is yours.
This is yours.

591
00:35:44.683 --> 00:35:45.809
Practice on this.

592
00:35:47.978 --> 00:35:48.979
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

593
00:35:48.979 --> 00:35:49.980
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

594
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.022
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

595
00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.316
They even have books
with actuaries...

596
00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.358
They even have books
with actuaries...

597
00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:54.652
...lists of every cause
of death imaginable.

598
00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.528
...lists of every cause
of death imaginable.

599
00:35:56.779 --> 00:35:57.780
Why don't you just shoot them
and fuck all this?

600
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.864
Why don't you just shoot them
and fuck all this?

601
00:35:59.031 --> 00:36:00.699
Good judgment
comes from experience...

602
00:36:00.949 --> 00:36:01.950
...and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.

603
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.701
...and a lot of that comes
from bad judgment.

604
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:22.513
Bed's under the boxes.

605
00:36:22.721 --> 00:36:24.639
Help yourself.

606
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:54.211
How long you been working on it?

607
00:36:56.672 --> 00:36:58.423
Two years.

608
00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.509
It's nice.

609
00:37:00.676 --> 00:37:02.594
When are we gonna go for a ride?

610
00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:04.555
We?

611
00:37:04.763 --> 00:37:05.889
Never.

612
00:37:07.683 --> 00:37:08.684
Time to take your training
to the next level.

613
00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:09.685
Time to take your training
to the next level.

614
00:37:09.685 --> 00:37:10.852
Time to take your training
to the next level.

615
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.751
-Who's that?
-He's good.

616
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:35.502
-Who's that?
-He's good.

617
00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.296
Nobody checked you out.

618
00:37:37.963 --> 00:37:39.756
I could come back.

619
00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.258
I'd rather not stand out here.

620
00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.300
I'd rather not stand out here.

621
00:37:51.643 --> 00:37:52.644
I gotta tell you, man.
I'm a little skittish right now.

622
00:37:52.644 --> 00:37:54.479
I gotta tell you, man.
I'm a little skittish right now.

623
00:37:54.646 --> 00:37:55.647
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

624
00:37:55.647 --> 00:37:56.648
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

625
00:37:56.648 --> 00:37:57.940
Not sure if this is a good time
for me to be doing anything.

626
00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.651
There's a lot of shit in the wind,
you know?

627
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:01.486
There's a lot of shit in the wind,
you know?

628
00:38:02.654 --> 00:38:03.655
I brought the list and the money.

629
00:38:03.655 --> 00:38:04.864
I brought the list and the money.

630
00:38:06.492 --> 00:38:07.826
Now's not a good time.

631
00:38:09.953 --> 00:38:11.663
Let me see the list.

632
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.128
All this by when?

633
00:38:18.337 --> 00:38:19.796
As soon as possible.

634
00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:22.007
All right.

635
00:38:22.216 --> 00:38:24.134
Take me a day to make it happen.

636
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.678
Let me have the money.

637
00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:07.845
-Autoerotic asphyxiation?
-Yep.

638
00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:08.846
-Autoerotic asphyxiation?
-Yep.

639
00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.514
-Autoerotic asphyxiation?
-Yep.

640
00:39:14.893 --> 00:39:15.894
Just thought
you should see one up close.

641
00:39:15.894 --> 00:39:17.687
Just thought
you should see one up close.

642
00:39:41.086 --> 00:39:42.087
Don't ever touch this.

643
00:39:42.087 --> 00:39:43.213
Don't ever touch this.

644
00:40:02.649 --> 00:40:04.108
Follow me.

645
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.412
-Who was he?
-A job.

646
00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:16.746
-Who was he?
-A job.

647
00:40:16.955 --> 00:40:18.915
Nothing more, nothing less.

648
00:40:19.124 --> 00:40:20.125
Makes you feel better,
he was an illegal arms dealer.

649
00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:21.584
Makes you feel better,
he was an illegal arms dealer.

650
00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:23.629
Sold weapons to anyone.
Cop killers, gangbangers, terrorists.

651
00:40:23.629 --> 00:40:24.630
Sold weapons to anyone.
Cop killers, gangbangers, terrorists.

652
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.631
Sold weapons to anyone.
Cop killers, gangbangers, terrorists.

653
00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:27.424
Sold weapons to anyone.
Cop killers, gangbangers, terrorists.

654
00:40:28.258 --> 00:40:29.259
He didn't discriminate.

655
00:40:29.259 --> 00:40:30.343
He didn't discriminate.

656
00:40:41.021 --> 00:40:42.439
Here's the file.

657
00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:47.068
The guy from the coffee shop?

658
00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:50.780
All yours.

659
00:40:52.157 --> 00:40:53.825
You wouldn't know it
by looking at him...

660
00:40:53.909 --> 00:40:55.744
...but he's a mechanic
for another group.

661
00:40:57.037 --> 00:40:58.038
His only routine is coffee
every morning from 9 to 10.

662
00:40:58.038 --> 00:40:59.956
His only routine is coffee
every morning from 9 to 10.

663
00:41:00.165 --> 00:41:01.166
Doesn't go anyplace twice
except here.

664
00:41:01.166 --> 00:41:02.625
Doesn't go anyplace twice
except here.

665
00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:05.045
He's insulated, protected.

666
00:41:05.045 --> 00:41:06.129
He's insulated, protected.

667
00:41:06.338 --> 00:41:08.048
No way in
without him seeing us coming.

668
00:41:08.256 --> 00:41:09.257
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas--

669
00:41:09.257 --> 00:41:10.258
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas--

670
00:41:10.258 --> 00:41:11.342
Except he has two weaknesses.
Chihuahuas--

671
00:41:11.551 --> 00:41:12.677
-Mind if I sit down?
-Please.

672
00:41:12.886 --> 00:41:13.887
--And boys. Young boys.

673
00:41:13.887 --> 00:41:15.680
--And boys. Young boys.

674
00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.473
-Coffee, black.
-Thank you.

675
00:41:17.683 --> 00:41:19.309
No doubt he's checked you out...

676
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:20.519
...and found no connection to you
and this world.

677
00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:21.603
...and found no connection to you
and this world.

678
00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:22.854
What he sees is a good-looking kid
who's kind of lost.

679
00:41:22.854 --> 00:41:24.438
What he sees is a good-looking kid
who's kind of lost.

680

-He likes that.
-Come here, baby.

684
00:41:30.028 --> 00:41:31.029
If he's interested,
the first thing he'll do is ask you.

685
00:41:31.029 --> 00:41:32.030
If he's interested,
the first thing he'll do is ask you.

686
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.531
If he's interested,
the first thing he'll do is ask you.

687
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.741
-So, you live around here, Steve?
-Your answer should be--

688
00:41:34.741 --> 00:41:36.576
-So, you live around here, Steve?
-Your answer should be--

689
00:41:36.702 --> 00:41:37.911
I'm bouncing around.

690
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.121
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

691
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:40.497
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

692
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.540
-He's my buddy.
-Yeah.

693
00:41:42.749 --> 00:41:43.750
-Then ask you if--
-You wanna get a drink one evening?

694
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:45.668
-Then ask you if--

695
00:41:45.877 --> 00:41:46.878
-Your answer should be--

00:41:46.878 --> 00:41:48.546
-Your answer should be--
-Yeah.

697
00:41:49.673 --> 00:41:51.007
Great.

698
00:41:51.216 --> 00:41:52.217
-That's great, isn't it?
-Flunitrazepam.

699
00:41:52.217 --> 00:41:53.218
-That's great, isn't it?
-Flunitrazepam.

700
00:41:53.218 --> 00:41:54.552
-That's great, isn't it?
-Flunitrazepam.

701
00:41:54.803 --> 00:41:56.346
Roofie.

702
00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.015
You want me to Kill him,
not rape him, right?

703
00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.016
You want me to Kill him,
not rape him, right?

704
00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.142
You want me to Kill him,
not rape him, right?

705
00:42:03.603 --> 00:42:05.521
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

706
00:42:06.064 --> 00:42:07.065
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

707
00:42:07.065 --> 00:42:08.066
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

708
00:42:08.066 --> 00:42:09.609
Over six, his heart stops and he's
brain dead in under three minutes.

709
00:42:11.278 --> 00:42:12.279
Do it in the bar. Make it clean.

710
00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:13.405
Do it in the bar. Make it clean.

711
00:42:20.662 --> 00:42:21.663
These fancy places,
they always water down the booze.

712
00:42:21.663 --> 00:42:23.456
These fancy places,
they always water down the booze.

713
00:42:23.665 --> 00:42:24.666
So I think that's why
these are going down so fast.

714
00:42:24.666 --> 00:42:25.667
So I think that's why
these are going down so fast.

715
00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:26.918
So I think that's why
these are going down so fast.

716
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:29.963
They don't water down wine,
that's for sure.

717
00:42:30.213 --> 00:42:31.214
It's really good.

718
00:42:31.465 --> 00:42:32.924
-Want another one?
-Yeah.

719
00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:34.718
-Jameson, right?
-Jameson, double, please.

720
00:42:34.968 --> 00:42:36.260
Right.

721
00:42:44.978 --> 00:42:45.979
Don't mess around with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

722
00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:46.980
Don't mess around with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

723
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.481
Don't mess around with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

724
00:42:51.902 --> 00:42:52.903
I wanna know what you know.

727
00:43:08.001 --> 00:43:09.168
What?

728
00:43:09.419 --> 00:43:11.212
-What's funny?
-No, nothing's funny.

729
00:43:11.421 --> 00:43:12.422
-I'm just, I think I've had too many.
-No, come on.

730
00:43:12.422 --> 00:43:13.423
-I'm just, I think I've had too many.
-No, come on.

731
00:43:13.423 --> 00:43:14.715
-I'm just, I think I've had too many.
-No, come on.

732
00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.843
No, I think
I'm gonna finish this one--

733
00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:17.928
I'm gonna finish this one
and then I'm gonna--

734
00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.179
I'm gonna finish this one
and then I'm gonna--

735
00:43:21.723 --> 00:43:22.724
I really should go to bed.
But it was very-- It was fun.

736
00:43:22.724 --> 00:43:23.725
I really should go to bed.
But it was very-- It was fun.

737
00:43:23.725 --> 00:43:25.727
I really should go to bed.
But it was very-- It was fun.

738
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.154
Steve.

739
00:43:38.657 --> 00:43:39.866
Hey.

740
00:43:40.158 --> 00:43:41.951

-How are you?
-I'm good, man.

743
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.581
Hey, can I give you
a ride someplace?

744
00:43:46.581 --> 00:43:47.707
Hey, can I give you

He's 6 feet 7, 300 pounds and lethal.

750
00:43:57.217 --> 00:43:59.093
Do not take this guy on.

751
00:43:59.302 --> 00:44:00.303
And whatever you do,
don't ever get into his car.

752
00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:01.304
And whatever you do,
don't ever get into his car.

755
00:44:19.906 --> 00:44:21.490
What do you think?

756
00:44:22.742 --> 00:44:23.868
It's beautiful.

757
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:25.954
Let me get you a drink.

758
00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:31.959
You paint?

759
00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.170
Yeah, it's more of a hobby, really.

760
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.254
Yeah, it's more of a hobby, really.

761
00:44:34.462 --> 00:44:35.463
Pretty serious hobby.

Pretty serious hobby.

763
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.678
Cheers.

764
00:44:43.054 --> 00:44:44.055
That's the sitting area, the fireplace.

765

That's the sitting area, the fireplace.

766
00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:47.100
Chillaxing room.

767

That is 14th century Buddha.

772
00:44:54.858 --> 00:44:56.484
That is 14th century Buddha.

773
00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:57.694
And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

774
00:44:57.694 --> 00:44:58.695
And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

775

I mean, really good friends.

783
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.759
You're shaking like a leaf.

784
00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.428
Sit down.

785
00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:42.906
All right, all right.

786
00:45:43.114 --> 00:45:44.782
Okay, let me do it.

787
00:45:44.991 --> 00:45:46.283
Slow down, cowboy.

788
00:48:28.738 --> 00:48:29.739
I told you to make it clean.

789
00:48:29.739 --> 00:48:30.781
I told you to make it clean.

790
00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:24.002
See you later.

791
00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.483
Was it work or pleasure?

792
00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.525
Was it work or pleasure?

793
00:49:51.696 --> 00:49:52.697
I wish someone
would hurt me like that.

794
00:49:52.697 --> 00:49:53.823

Yeah.

799
00:51:38.553 --> 00:51:39.554
You used an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

800

806
00:51:47.353 --> 00:51:48.854
You and I don't have one.

807
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:51.691
Just the price.

808
00:51:53.651 --> 00:51:54.652
Or think someone trained by me
would be valuable to you.

809

This job needs to be done
immediately.

816
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:08.166
The client's willing to pay
a premium for it.

817
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:09.751
I don't think so. It's too quick.

818
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:11.002
I don't think so. It's too quick.

819
00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:12.170
Your behavior is making me

You're on a short leash
with this one.

824
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:18.384
You're on a short leash
with this one.

825
00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:19.761
The file is a priority.

826
00:52:19.761 --> 00:52:21.679
The file is a priority.

827
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:26.851
I'll look it over.

828
00:52:26.851 --> 00:52:27.935
I'll look it over.

829
00:52:57.882 --> 00:52:59.300
I am one with God.

830
00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.551
God touches me
and I touch his people.

831

This will choke him.

943
00:58:31.757 --> 00:58:32.758
If they think
that I'm going to pay full price...

944
00:58:32.758 --> 00:58:34.426
If they think
that I'm going to pay full price...

945
00:58:34.635 --> 00:58:35.636
...for a four-bedroom in this market,
they're crazy.

00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:39.140
Only I can tie others.

949
00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:40.724
Only I can tie others.

950
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:43.602
How can I change the world?

951

with you at all times.

1014
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.271
Do not leave bags unattended.

1015
01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:38.438
Do not leave bags unattended.

1016
01:03:44.028 --> 01:03:45.320
All five were killed.

1017
01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:47.114
All five were killed.

1018
01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:48.323
All five were killed.

1019
01:03:48.532 --> 01:03:49.533
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

1020
01:03:49.533 --> 01:03:50.700
You probably knew
some of the men on that team.

1021
01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.257
Taxi.

1022
01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:07.509
Terminal D?

1023
01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:09.302
Next bus. Down the street.

1024
01:04:09.553 --> 01:04:10.554
-Leaves in 15 minutes.
-Thanks.

1025
01:04:10.554 --> 01:04:11.555
-Leaves in 15 minutes.
-Thanks.

1026
01:04:11.555 --> 01:04:12.639
-Leaves in 15 minutes.
-Thanks.

1027
01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:36.622
-When does this leave?
-In 15 minutes.

1028
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:37.623
-When does this leave?
-In 15 minutes.

1029
01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:39.166
-When does this leave?
-In 15 minutes.

1030
01:04:42.878 --> 01:04:43.879
Doesn't give us much time, then.

1031
01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:45.505
Doesn't give us much time, then.

1032
01:04:49.676 --> 01:04:51.260
What do you want?

1033
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.431
I wanna know
what you're doing alive.

1034
01:04:54.431 --> 01:04:55.932
I wanna know
what you're doing alive.

1035
01:04:56.934 --> 01:04:57.935
Last time I saw you,
you had a bullet in your head.

1036
01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.728
Last time I saw you,
you had a bullet in your head.

1037
01:05:01.688 --> 01:05:02.689
What really happened
in Cape Town?

1038
01:05:02.689 --> 01:05:04.190
What really happened
in Cape Town?

1039
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.401
-Where's the rest of your team?
-They're dead.

1040
01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.402
-Where's the rest of your team?
-They're dead.

1041
01:05:06.402 --> 01:05:07.820
-Where's the rest of your team?
-They're dead.

1042
01:05:08.779 --> 01:05:09.780
Who paid you?
Was it Harry or Dean?

1043
01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.989
Who paid you?
Was it Harry or Dean?

1044
01:05:11.782 --> 01:05:12.783
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to Kill the others.

1045
01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:13.784
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to Kill the others.

1046
01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:14.826
Dean paid me a very large amount
of money to Kill the others.

1047
01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:16.036
Told me to fake my death.
Disappear.

1048
01:05:16.036 --> 01:05:17.662
Told me to fake my death.
Disappear.

1049
01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:19.831
You know what else he told me?

1050
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.041
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation.

1051
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.043
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operation.

1052
01:05:23.585 --> 01:05:24.586
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

1053
01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:25.587
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

1054
01:05:25.587 --> 01:05:26.588
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

1055
01:05:26.588 --> 01:05:28.298
He was about to blow the whistle
and had to be taken care of.

1056
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.551
They knew just the man for the job.

1057
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:31.885
They knew just the man for the job.

1058
01:05:32.719 --> 01:05:34.595
Someone who could get to him.

1059
01:05:35.931 --> 01:05:36.932
It's not the fact
that you killed him, is it?

1060
01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:38.725
It's not the fact
that you killed him, is it?

1061
01:05:39.601 --> 01:05:40.602
It's that they played you so easily.

1062
01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:42.186
It's that they played you so easily.

1063
01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:43.939
That's what bothers you.

1064
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.149
Am I right?

1065
01:08:23.807 --> 01:08:24.808
-Well?
-Not so good for your side.

1066
01:08:24.808 --> 01:08:26.392
-Well?
-Not so good for your side.

1067
01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:28.020
Those were my two best teams.
I guess I'll have to send more.

1068
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.021
Those were my two best teams.
I guess I'll have to send more.

1069
01:08:29.021 --> 01:08:30.022
Those were my two best teams.
I guess I'll have to send more.

1070
01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:31.231
Those were my two best teams.
I guess I'll have to send more.

1071
01:08:31.648 --> 01:08:33.483
Save the fuel.

1072
01:08:33.692 --> 01:08:34.818
I'm coming for you.

1073
01:08:42.534 --> 01:08:43.868
When are you gonna be home?

1074
01:08:44.077 --> 01:08:45.286
I'm really hungry.

1075
01:08:45.495 --> 01:08:46.996
Where are you?

1076
01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:49.081
I'm in the living room.

1077
01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:50.792
-Sit down on the couch.
-Okay.

1078
01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:51.793
-Sit down on the couch.
-Okay.

1079
01:08:51.793 --> 01:08:52.835
-Sit down on the couch.
-Okay.

1080
01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:55.005
I'm guessing you're not alone.

1081
01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.257
There's a gun
down the left side cushion.

1082
01:08:57.257 --> 01:08:58.424
There's a gun
down the left side cushion.

1083
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:00.594
It's loaded and the safety's off.

1084
01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:02.929
But I'm not a lefty.

1085
01:09:03.597 --> 01:09:05.515
Then you're gonna die.

1086
01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.476
All right.
I'll see you when you get here.

1087
01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:08.685
All right.
I'll see you when you get here.

1088
01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:21.364
I'll be there in five.

1089
01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.335
-Who sent those guys?
-The man who employs me.

1090
01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.336
-Who sent those guys?
-The man who employs me.

1091
01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.754
-Who sent those guys?
-The man who employs me.

1092
01:09:37.047 --> 01:09:38.048
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

1093
01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:39.049
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

1094
01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:40.258
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

1095
01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.146
You set?

1096
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.070
Get in the boat.

1097
01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:01.757
You ever think
about the people you've killed?

1098
01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.258
You ever think
about the people you've killed?

1099
01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.430
No.

1100
01:11:09.556 --> 01:11:10.557
You ever kill someone you know?

1101
01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:11.641
You ever kill someone you know?

1102
01:11:17.898 --> 01:11:19.608
Yes.

1103
01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:22.486
Did it feel any different?

1104
01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:24.029
Did it feel any different?

1105
01:11:27.574 --> 01:11:29.534
Not in the moment.

1106
01:11:31.495 --> 01:11:33.288
After.

1107
01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.291
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1108
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:37.292
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1109
01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.293
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1110
01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.294
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1111
01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:40.295
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1112
01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:41.587
Do you give them some
kind of warning or time to prepare?

1113
01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:43.381
Kind of time to...

1114
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.507
Kind of time to...

1115
01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:49.095
...make peace?

1116
01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.934
There's no peace.

1117
01:11:58.897 --> 01:11:59.898
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

1118
01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:00.899
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

1119
01:12:00.899 --> 01:12:01.900
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

1120
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.192
So it's best not to let them know
when you're coming.

1121
01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:10.867
Yes.

1122
01:12:12.369 --> 01:12:14.287
I guess
it doesn't really matter anyway...

1123
01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:15.497
...as long as they're dead
and you're not, right?

1124
01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.248
...as long as they're dead
and you're not, right?

1125
01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.773
Hello, Finch.

1126
01:12:48.572 --> 01:12:49.573
Oh, my God, who are you?

1127
01:12:49.573 --> 01:12:51.533
Oh, my God, who are you?

1128
01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:53.702
What are you doing here?

1129
01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.245
What are you doing here?

1130
01:12:55.453 --> 01:12:56.454
Oh, God. Jesus.

1131
01:12:56.454 --> 01:12:58.205
Oh, God. Jesus.

1132
01:13:02.502 --> 01:13:03.503
I want you to listen to me closely.

1133
01:13:03.503 --> 01:13:05.046
I want you to listen to me closely.

1134
01:13:05.297 --> 01:13:06.298
I don't care who I hurt or who I Kill.

1135
01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:07.549
I don't care who I hurt or who I Kill.

1136
01:13:07.757 --> 01:13:09.550
Understand?

1137
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:14.430
No, please. No.

1138
01:13:14.639 --> 01:13:15.640
No, no, no.

1139
01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.183
No, no, no.

1140
01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.521
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I came here to find out.

1141
01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:23.105
You're gonna tell me exactly
what I came here to find out.

1142
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.441
Where's Dean?

1143
01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:25.650
Where's Dean?

1144
01:13:39.456 --> 01:13:40.457
It's up to you how far I go.

1145
01:13:40.457 --> 01:13:41.541
It's up to you how far I go.

1146
01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:45.128
Fingers.

1147
01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:48.631
Wrist.

1148
01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:51.759
Elbow.

1149
01:13:51.968 --> 01:13:52.969
Jesus, John,
tell him what he wants to know.

1150
01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:53.970
Jesus, John,
tell him what he wants to know.

1151
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:55.471
Jesus, John,
tell him what he wants to know.

1152
01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:05.064
Okay, okay.

1153
01:14:05.273 --> 01:14:07.233
300 Colby Plaza.

1154
01:14:08.151 --> 01:14:09.152
300 Colby Plaza.
That's where he is, I swear.

1155
01:14:09.152 --> 01:14:10.945
300 Colby Plaza.
That's where he is, I swear.

1156
01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:20.956
Looks like you're gonna miss
a good dinner.

1157
01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.457
Looks like you're gonna miss
a good dinner.

1158
01:14:24.459 --> 01:14:25.460
My God, you're a bastard.

1159
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.461
My God, you're a bastard.

1160
01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.587
My God, you're a bastard.

1161
01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.266
Yes.

1162
01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.810
How much was Harry's life worth?

1163
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.645
How much was Harry's life worth?

1164
01:14:45.313 --> 01:14:47.064
Fifty million.

1165
01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.651
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1166
01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:50.693
And here's what I'm gonna do.

1167
01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:52.320
Ten million wired to the bank
of your choice within 24 hours.

1168
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.321
Ten million wired to the bank
of your choice within 24 hours.

1169
01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:55.114
Ten million wired to the bank
of your choice within 24 hours.

1170
01:14:56.366 --> 01:14:58.034
It's a good deal. You should take it.

1171
01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:00.161
Not interested.

1172
01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:01.788
The killer grows a conscience.

1173
01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:03.206
The killer grows a conscience.

1174
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.541
I'd say that's a breach
of professional ethics, Mr. Bishop.

1175
01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:05.542
I'd say that's a breach
of professional ethics, Mr. Bishop.

1176
01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:07.252
I'd say that's a breach
of professional ethics, Mr. Bishop.

1177
01:15:07.919 --> 01:15:08.920
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

1178
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.921
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

1179
01:15:09.921 --> 01:15:11.213
Harry's death was business,
pure and simple.

1180
01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:12.424
Well, it's not gonna be
so simple now.

1181
01:15:12.424 --> 01:15:14.259
Well, it's not gonna be
so simple now.

1182
01:15:14.467 --> 01:15:16.260
You got that right.

1183
01:15:16.469 --> 01:15:17.470
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big...

1184
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:18.471
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big...

1185
01:15:18.471 --> 01:15:19.805
Because now I'm gonna put a price
on your head that's so big...

1186
01:15:20.056 --> 01:15:21.515
...when you look in the mirror...

1187
01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:22.767
...your reflection's gonna
wanna shoot you in the face.

1188
01:15:22.767 --> 01:15:24.393
...your reflection's gonna
wanna shoot you in the face.

1189
01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:25.645
-You won't survive that long.
-You're a fool.

1190
01:15:25.645 --> 01:15:26.646
-You won't survive that long.
-You're a fool.

1191
01:15:26.646 --> 01:15:28.230
-You won't survive that long.
-You're a fool.

1192
01:15:28.565 --> 01:15:29.566
You think you can get to me
before I get to you?

1193
01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:31.526
You think you can get to me
before I get to you?

1194
01:15:31.735 --> 01:15:33.486
I already have.

1195
01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:39.701
-Where's Conference Room E?
-Floor upstairs, sir.

1196
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.160
-Where's Conference Room E?
-Floor upstairs, sir.

1197
01:15:41.369 --> 01:15:42.370
He's in the building.
Get me the fuck out of here.

1198
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:43.996
He's in the building.
Get me the fuck out of here.

1199
01:16:41.387 --> 01:16:42.388
-Did they find Bishop?
-Nothing yet.

1200
01:16:42.388 --> 01:16:43.806
-Did they find Bishop?
-Nothing yet.

1201
01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:45.642
-No, no, no.
-Get off the fucking bus.

1202
01:16:45.642 --> 01:16:47.560
-No, no, no.
-Get off the fucking bus.

1203
01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.770
Move. Get off the fucking bus.

1204
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.771
Move. Get off the fucking bus.
Move.

1205
01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:50.813
Move. Get off the fucking bus.
Move.

1206
01:17:19.217 --> 01:17:20.593
Go!

1207
01:17:57.881 --> 01:17:59.883
Back up, come on. Let's go.

1208
01:18:49.098 --> 01:18:50.808
Fuck you.

1209
01:19:20.797 --> 01:19:21.798
What's the plan now?

1210
01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:22.965
What's the plan now?

1211
01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.676
Disappear.

1212
01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:27.595
New names. New occupation.

1213
01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:28.887
New names. New occupation.

1214
01:19:29.055 --> 01:19:30.264
Together?

1215
01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:33.643
That's up to you.

1216
01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:34.769
That's up to you.

1217
01:19:35.144 --> 01:19:36.979
What are we gonna do?
We gonna whittle?

1218
01:19:37.188 --> 01:19:38.189
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

1219
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:39.190
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

1220
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.608
We gonna get bunk beds?
Move into a teepee?

1221
01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:47.490
Want a water?

1222
01:19:59.877 --> 01:20:00.878
I've always had this...

1223
01:20:00.878 --> 01:20:02.337
I've always had this...

1224
01:20:04.674 --> 01:20:05.675
...anger inside...

1225
01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.343
...anger inside...

1226
01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:08.553
...and now I feel
like I have a place to put it.

1227
01:20:08.553 --> 01:20:09.554
...and now I feel
like I have a place to put it.

1228
01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:10.805
...and now I feel
like I have a place to put it.

1229
01:20:11.014 --> 01:20:12.015
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

1230
01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:13.016
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

1231
01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:14.350
I think I would miss this
if I had to stop now.

1232
01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.149
I could always go
into business for myself.

1233
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:22.150
I could always go
into business for myself.

1234
01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.234
I could always go
into business for myself.

1235
01:20:23.651 --> 01:20:24.652
There are a lot of people out there
who would pay.

1236
01:20:24.652 --> 01:20:25.653
There are a lot of people out there
who would pay.

1237
01:20:25.653 --> 01:20:26.695
There are a lot of people out there
who would pay.

1238
01:20:28.072 --> 01:20:29.073
And I think you were wrong.

1239
01:20:29.073 --> 01:20:30.199
And I think you were wrong.

1240
01:20:31.909 --> 01:20:32.910
Vengeance is the mission.

1241
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:33.911
Vengeance is the mission.

1242
01:20:33.911 --> 01:20:35.370
Vengeance is the mission.

1243
01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:56.059
-You want anything?
-No.

1244
01:20:56.059 --> 01:20:57.060
-You want anything?
-No.

1245
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.227
-You want anything?
-No.

1246
01:21:16.704 --> 01:21:17.705
Last chance.

1247
01:21:17.705 --> 01:21:18.747
Last chance.

1248
01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:21.751
I'm good.

1249
01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:24.545
Steven.

1250
01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.050
I'm sorry
for everything that happened.

1251
01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.426
I'm sorry
for everything that happened.

1252
01:21:32.095 --> 01:21:33.096
Well, you know me, man.

1253
01:21:33.096 --> 01:21:34.305
Well, you know me, man.

1254
01:21:34.555 --> 01:21:35.556
I don't give a shit.

1255
01:21:35.556 --> 01:21:36.598
I don't give a shit.

1256
01:25:21.824 --> 01:25:22.950
All four cameras.

1257
01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:24.160
-Watch number two.
-Okay.

1258
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.161
