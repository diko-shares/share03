1
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.107
You're looking good, Dutch.

2
00:03:59.268 --> 00:04:01.077
It's been a long time, General.

3
00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:02.963
Come on inside.

4
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500
18 hours ago, we lost a chopper,

5
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.646
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide
from this charming little country.

6
00:04:10.746 --> 00:04:13.237
We've got a transponder
fixed on their position...

7
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.100
about here.

8
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:19.015
This cabinet minister,

9
00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:22.327
does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

10
00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:25.592
Apparently, they strayed off course.

11
00:04:25.692 --> 00:04:28.080
And we're fairly certain
they're in guerrilla hands.

12
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.250
So why don't you use the regular army?

13
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.850
What do you need us for?

14
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:35.855
Cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.

15
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:43.737
Dillon.

16
00:04:46.273 --> 00:04:48.283
You son of a bitch.

17
00:04:52.997 --> 00:04:54.339
What's the matter?

18
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.046
The CIA got you pushing too many pencils?

19
00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:05.133
- Had enough?
- Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

20
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.880
OK, OK, OK.

21
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.142
- Never did know when to quit.
- Damn good to see you, Dutch.

22
00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:17.088
- What is this fucking tie business?
- Come on, forget about my tie, man.

23
00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:19.507
I heard about that little job
you pulled off in Berlin.

24
00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:20.750
Very nice, Dutch.

25
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.051
Good old days.

26
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:25.388
Yeah, like the good old days.
Then how come you passed on Libya?

27
00:05:25.488 --> 00:05:29.558
- That wasn't my style.
- You got no style. You know that.

28
00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:32.063
Come on. Why'd you pass?

29
00:05:34.663 --> 00:05:38.092
We're a rescue team, not assassins.

30
00:05:40.002 --> 00:05:41.210
Now,

31
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.072
what do we gotta do?

32
00:05:43.172 --> 00:05:46.040
That cabinet minister is very important
to our scope of operations

33
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.240
in this part of the world.

34
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.040
The general is sayin'
that a couple of our friends

35
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.140
are about to get squeezed,

36
00:05:50.244 --> 00:05:51.447
and we can't let that happen.

37
00:05:51.547 --> 00:05:52.855
We need the best.

38
00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:54.483
That's why you're here.

39
00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:55.686
Go on.

40
00:05:55.787 --> 00:05:58.295
Simple setup. One-day operation.

41
00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:01.297
We pick up their trail at the chopper,
run 'em down, grab those hostages,

42
00:06:01.402 --> 00:06:04.206
and bounce back across the border
before anybody knows we were there.

43
00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:06.002
What do you mean, "we"?

44
00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:07.926
I'm goin' in with you, Dutch.

45
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.007
General, my team always works alone.

46
00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.006
You know that.

47
00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:18.090
I'm afraid we all have our orders, Major.

48
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.791
Once you reach your objective,

49
00:06:19.892 --> 00:06:22.695
Dillon will evaluate the situation
and take charge.

50
00:06:49.738 --> 00:06:51.246
Yeah, OK.

51
00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.353
Rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.

52
00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:39.853
AWACS contact on four-hour intervals.

53
00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:41.053
Who's our backup?

54
00:07:41.156 --> 00:07:43.984
No such thing, old buddy.
This is a one-way ticket.

55
00:07:44.084 --> 00:07:45.784
Once we've crossed that border,

56
00:07:45.884 --> 00:07:47.184
we're on our own.

57
00:07:48.897 --> 00:07:50.965
This is getting better by the minute.

58
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.820
Hey, Billy...

59
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.959
Billy!

60
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.300
The other day I went up to my girlfriend.

61
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.600
I said,
"You know, I'd like a little pussy."

62
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.806
She said, "Me too.
Mine's as big as a house."

63
00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:23.581
You see, she wanted a littler one
cos hers was...

64
00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:27.323
big as a house.

65
00:08:34.677 --> 00:08:37.504
Get that stinkin' shit out of my face.

66
00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:42.877
Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here.

67
00:08:42.977 --> 00:08:46.048
This stuff'll make you a goddamn
sexual tyrannosaurus,

68
00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:47.572
just like me.

69
00:08:48.056 --> 00:08:50.566
Yeah.
Strap this on your sore ass, Blain.

70
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.293
That was in '72.

71
00:09:03.394 --> 00:09:05.473
Me and Dutch both got one.

72
00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:30.164
That's a real nasty habit you got there.

73
00:09:37.408 --> 00:09:38.509
Right.

74
00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.369
Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.

75
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.776
You never were that smart.

76
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.567
Hawkins, you're up.

77
00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:12.729
The pilots have been shot
one round in the head.

78
00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:15.083
Whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.

79
00:13:16.183 --> 00:13:17.783
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.

80
00:13:17.883 --> 00:13:19.383
There's something else, Major.

81
00:13:19.753 --> 00:13:21.788
This is no ordinary army taxi.

82
00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:25.233
It looks more
like a surveillance bird to me.

83
00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:26.946
Pick up the trail yet?

84
00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:28.893
Billy's on it.

85
00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:30.814
Heat seeker, Dillon.

86
00:13:31.014 --> 00:13:32.715
That's pretty sophisticated for a bunch

87
00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:34.416
- of half-assed mountain boys.
- Major!

88
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.520
I guess they're getting
better equipped every day.

89
00:13:37.229 --> 00:13:39.039
There were 12 guerrillas.

90
00:13:39.439 --> 00:13:41.523
They took the two men from the helicopter,

91
00:13:41.624 --> 00:13:43.177
but there's something else.

92
00:13:43.277 --> 00:13:47.431
- What do you mean?
- Six men wearing US-issued army boots.

93
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:50.992
They came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.

94
00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:54.529
Mean anything to you?

95
00:13:56.473 --> 00:13:58.528
Probably just another rebel patrol.

96
00:13:58.829 --> 00:14:00.921
They operate in here all the time.

97
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.728
- Get ahead and see what you can find.
- Yes.

98
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:36.979
What's he got?

99
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.440
Same business.

100
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.692
Guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper,

101
00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:43.012
followed by men with American equipment.

102
00:14:43.712 --> 00:14:47.212
- Do you remember Afghanistan?
- Trying to forget it.

103
00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:48.919
Come on, let's go.

104
00:16:14.803 --> 00:16:16.622
Holy mother of God.

105
00:16:43.698 --> 00:16:45.698
Jim Hopper.

106
00:16:46.585 --> 00:16:48.502
Mac, cut 'em down.

107
00:16:58.805 --> 00:17:00.432
I knew these men.

108
00:17:00.932 --> 00:17:02.861
Green Berets out of Fort Bragg.

109
00:17:02.962 --> 00:17:04.945
What the hell were they doing here?

110
00:17:05.145 --> 00:17:08.040
I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.

111
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.343
Nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.

112
00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:13.044
They shouldn't have been here.

113
00:17:13.445 --> 00:17:15.248
Well, somebody sent them.

114
00:17:19.075 --> 00:17:20.962
The guerrillas skinned them?

115
00:17:22.162 --> 00:17:24.182
Why did they skin them?

116
00:17:25.582 --> 00:17:27.984
Ain't no way for no soldier to die.

117
00:17:32.631 --> 00:17:35.533
- What happened here, Billy?
- Strange, Major.

118
00:17:36.243 --> 00:17:38.048
There was a firefight.

119
00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:41.249
They were shooting in all directions.

120
00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:44.793
I can't believe that Jim Hopper
walked into an ambush.

121
00:17:44.893 --> 00:17:46.599
I don't believe he did.

122
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.800
I can't find a single track.

123
00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:52.858
It just doesn't make sense.

124
00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:54.978
What about the rest of Hopper's men?

125
00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:56.889
There's no sign, sir.

126
00:17:57.889 --> 00:17:59.691
They never left here.

127
00:18:02.077 --> 00:18:04.479
Hell, it's like they just disappeared.

128
00:18:07.604 --> 00:18:09.405
Stick with the guerrilla trail.

129
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.169
Let's get the hostages.

130
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.107
We move. Five-metre spread.

131
00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:15.718
No sound.

132
00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:19.327
It's time to let old painless out the bag.

133
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:24.923
Payback time.

134
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:58.497
You're ghostin' us, motherfucker.

135
00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:00.720
I don't care who you are back in the world.

136
00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.620
You give our position up one more time,

137
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.722
I'll bleed you, real quiet,

138
00:20:04.823 --> 00:20:06.323
and leave you here.

139
00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:07.735
Got that?

140
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.900
He killed one of the hostages.

141
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
We move.

142
00:21:58.146 --> 00:21:59.931
Mac, Blain - the nest.

143
00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:01.975
Billy, Poncho - the guard.

144
00:22:02.075 --> 00:22:03.532
Hawkins, Dillon - backup.

145
00:22:03.633 --> 00:22:05.539
As soon as they're set,
I hit the fuel dump.

146
00:23:04.629 --> 00:23:06.039
One down.

147
00:24:06.107 --> 00:24:07.774
What the hell's he doin'?

148
00:24:22.098 --> 00:24:23.804
What the fuck...?

149
00:24:34.769 --> 00:24:36.369
Showtime, Kid.

150
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.333
Target's the centre of the palapa.

151
00:25:28.498 --> 00:25:30.103
Dutch, on your nine.

152
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:37.102
Get that mother...

153
00:26:46.684 --> 00:26:47.790
Go.

154
00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:23.010
Stick around.

155
00:27:23.805 --> 00:27:25.406
Hostages are inside.

156
00:27:31.854 --> 00:27:33.380
Knock, knock.

157
00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:44.858
I got 'em.

158
00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.854
Hawkins, call in position and situation.

159
00:27:47.955 --> 00:27:49.772
Get Con Op on the hook.

160
00:27:49.872 --> 00:27:51.375
You got it, Major.

161
00:27:59.402 --> 00:28:00.811
Shit.

162
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.600
Mac!

163
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.700
- Yo!
- Any sign of the other hostage?

164
00:28:05.346 --> 00:28:08.571
Found the other guy
- he's dead, too -

165
00:28:09.072 --> 00:28:10.893
and the gear from the chopper.

166
00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:13.871
But if they're Central American,
I'm a goddamn Chinaman.

167
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:17.008
From the looks of it,
our cabinet minister was CIA.

168
00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:19.218
Another thing, Major.
They were lucky.

169
00:28:19.318 --> 00:28:22.881
The other guys they waxed
were Russian military advisers.

170
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.767
Something pretty big
was gonna happen here.

171
00:28:25.995 --> 00:28:26.995
Good work, Mac.

172
00:28:27.095 --> 00:28:28.811
Clear the area. No traces.

173
00:28:28.911 --> 00:28:31.446
- Get the men ready to move.
- Right.

174
00:28:39.338 --> 00:28:42.142
Son of a bitch is dug in
like an Alabama tick.

175
00:28:42.842 --> 00:28:44.842
You're hit. You're bleedin', man.

176
00:28:44.942 --> 00:28:46.747
I ain't got time to bleed.

177
00:28:48.803 --> 00:28:49.803
OK.

178
00:28:54.504 --> 00:28:56.104
You got time to duck?

179
00:29:02.778 --> 00:29:04.806
This is goddamn beautiful.

180
00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:10.209
Goddamn jackpot.

181
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.810
This is more than we ever thought we'd get.

182
00:29:14.165 --> 00:29:16.170
We got those bastards.

183
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400
We got 'em.

184
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.502
I think this is what you're looking for.

185
00:29:22.089 --> 00:29:23.489
You set us up!

186
00:29:23.622 --> 00:29:26.369
It's all bullshit. All of it.

187
00:29:26.469 --> 00:29:28.672
The cabinet minister, the whole business.

188
00:29:28.773 --> 00:29:30.665
Got us in here to do your dirty work.

189
00:29:30.765 --> 00:29:32.570
Look, we just stopped a major invasion.

190
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.670
In three days they'd have been crossin'
the border with this stuff.

191
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.670
- Why us?
- Because nobody else could've pulled it off.

192
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.675
You're pissed about the cover story.
I knew I couldn't get you in without it.

193
00:29:40.775 --> 00:29:42.836
So, what story did you hand to Hopper?

194
00:29:43.436 --> 00:29:45.694
Look, we've been looking
for this place for months.

195
00:29:45.795 --> 00:29:48.099
My men were in that chopper
when it got hit!

196
00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:49.729
Hopper's orders were
to go in and get my men

197
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.830
and he disappeared!

198
00:29:50.934 --> 00:29:52.737
He didn't disappear.
He was skinned alive!

199
00:29:52.837 --> 00:29:55.231
And my orders were to get somebody
I knew could crack these bastards.

200
00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:58.768
So you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder.

201
00:30:02.088 --> 00:30:03.890
What happened to you, Dillon?

202
00:30:04.731 --> 00:30:07.134
You used to be somebody
I could trust.

203
00:30:07.957 --> 00:30:09.476
I woke up.

204
00:30:10.306 --> 00:30:11.907
Why don't you?

205
00:30:12.507 --> 00:30:14.317
You're an asset,

206
00:30:14.718 --> 00:30:17.019
an expendable asset.

207
00:30:17.345 --> 00:30:20.748
And I used you to get the job done.
Got it?

208
00:30:23.618 --> 00:30:25.887
My men are not expendable.

209
00:30:28.681 --> 00:30:31.158
- And I don't do this kind of work.
- Major!

210
00:30:31.358 --> 00:30:33.760
Major, we stepped into some real shit here.

211
00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:38.299
Air surveillance says
we've got guerrillas all over the place.

212
00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:40.680
Can't be more than one, two miles away.

213
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:42.805
- How much time?
- Half an hour, maybe less.

214
00:30:42.906 --> 00:30:44.405
- Tell Mac we move in five.
- Yes, sir.

215
00:30:44.505 --> 00:30:46.313
Wait, she goes with us.
She's too valuable.

216
00:30:46.414 --> 00:30:47.722
She's got to know the whole network.

217
00:30:47.842 --> 00:30:49.842
She'll give away our position
any chance she gets.

218
00:30:49.942 --> 00:30:50.942
No deal.

219
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.874
You're still under orders, Major.

220
00:30:53.025 --> 00:30:55.029
Now, you wanna make that call or should I?

221
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.800
She's your baggage.

222
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.921
You fall behind and you're on your own.

223
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.650
This place is too hot for a pickup.

224
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.140
They won't touch us
till we get over the border.

225
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.050
Billy, give me a way out of this hole.

226
00:31:17.301 --> 00:31:19.452
Aerial says we are cut off.

227
00:31:19.582 --> 00:31:23.319
The only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.

228
00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:25.929
I wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.

229
00:31:27.298 --> 00:31:28.800
Not much choice.

230
00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.700
Poncho, take lead.

231
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.200
Double-time it.

232
00:31:52.106 --> 00:31:53.106
Dillon!

233
00:31:53.357 --> 00:31:54.457
Dillon!

234
00:31:55.701 --> 00:31:56.969
Over here.

235
00:32:09.965 --> 00:32:12.185
- Turn around.
- Why?

236
00:32:23.602 --> 00:32:24.805
Thanks.

237
00:32:26.399 --> 00:32:27.802
Any time.

238
00:32:33.781 --> 00:32:34.882
Billy.

239
00:32:35.083 --> 00:32:36.216
Billy!

240
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:40.319
The other day,
I was goin' down on my girlfriend.

241
00:32:40.579 --> 00:32:41.618
I said to her,

242
00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:44.719
"Jeez, you've got a big pussy.
Jeez, you've got a big pussy."

243
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.820
She said,
"Why did you say that twice?"

244
00:32:47.002 --> 00:32:48.629
I said, "I didn't."

245
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:53.030
See, it was cos of the echo.

246
00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.200
With the...

247
00:34:19.178 --> 00:34:21.978
Over here. Over here. Over here.

248
00:34:23.432 --> 00:34:25.467
Turn around. Turn around.

249
00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:29.596
Turn around. Turn around.
Over here.

250
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.400
Any time.

251
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:52.400
Any time.

252
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:38.952
Goddamn.

253
00:36:40.706 --> 00:36:42.617
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

254
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.940
I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man,

255
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.440
but nothin' like this.

256
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.100
I hear you.

257
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.414
This shit's somethin'.

258
00:36:52.004 --> 00:36:54.604
Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.

259
00:36:55.407 --> 00:36:57.207
Hey, ique pasa, amigo?

260
00:36:57.308 --> 00:36:59.008
Little taste of home.

261
00:37:02.925 --> 00:37:06.995
You lose it here,
you're in a world of hurt.

262
00:37:14.802 --> 00:37:16.602
Come on, sweetheart.
Stop sandbaggin' it.

263
00:37:16.702 --> 00:37:17.707
Now, get up.

264
00:37:18.774 --> 00:37:20.017
Come on, get up.

265
00:37:20.118 --> 00:37:21.375
Would you get up?

266
00:37:31.704 --> 00:37:34.513
Maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.

267
00:37:42.548 --> 00:37:45.652
Try it again, please.

268
00:38:49.823 --> 00:38:51.959
What's got Billy so spooked?

269
00:38:52.659 --> 00:38:54.193
Can't say, Major.

270
00:38:54.294 --> 00:38:56.931
Been acting squirrely all morning.

271
00:38:57.331 --> 00:38:59.331
That damn nose of his,

272
00:38:59.531 --> 00:39:01.046
it's weird.

273
00:39:42.608 --> 00:39:43.909
What is it?

274
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:48.310
Billy.

275
00:39:51.343 --> 00:39:53.579
What the hell is wrong with you?

276
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.268
There's something in those trees.

277
00:40:37.105 --> 00:40:39.105
Do you see anything?

278
00:40:39.725 --> 00:40:41.593
Up there.

279
00:40:43.103 --> 00:40:44.345
Nothing.

280
00:40:45.672 --> 00:40:47.407
What do you think?

281
00:40:53.614 --> 00:40:55.519
I guess it's nothing, Major.

282
00:41:52.256 --> 00:41:53.457
Please.

283
00:41:53.857 --> 00:41:55.092
Please!

284
00:43:07.904 --> 00:43:09.413
Billy, break left.

285
00:43:09.914 --> 00:43:11.416
Mac, right.

286
00:43:11.626 --> 00:43:12.837
What the...?

287
00:43:13.837 --> 00:43:16.237
- This isn't her blood.
- What the hell'd you do to him?

288
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:17.441
Major,

289
00:43:17.875 --> 00:43:19.551
you'd better take a look at this.

290
00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:21.261
Did you find Hawkins?

291
00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:22.601
I...

292
00:43:23.096 --> 00:43:24.756
I can't tell.

293
00:43:42.199 --> 00:43:44.401
What in God's name...?

294
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:46.710
I think it's Hawkins.

295
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:50.400
Where the hell is his body?

296
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.103
There's no sign of it.

297
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.665
Ask her what happened.

298
00:44:16.483 --> 00:44:18.084
She says the jungle,

299
00:44:18.475 --> 00:44:20.387
it just came alive and took him.

300
00:44:20.487 --> 00:44:21.494
Bullshit!

301
00:44:21.595 --> 00:44:23.396
That's not what she said.

302
00:44:24.116 --> 00:44:25.766
What she said doesn't make any sense.

303
00:44:25.867 --> 00:44:27.436
Look, those sappers
have been following us ever since...

304
00:44:27.536 --> 00:44:30.454
They've been in front of us, man.
This woman just...

305
00:44:31.123 --> 00:44:32.324
Hold it!

306
00:44:32.874 --> 00:44:33.876
Hold it.

307
00:44:33.977 --> 00:44:36.482
Why didn't they take his radio
or his weapon?

308
00:44:37.462 --> 00:44:38.964
Why didn't she escape?

309
00:44:42.551 --> 00:44:43.652
Hopper.

310
00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:45.084
What?

311
00:44:46.972 --> 00:44:49.541
They did the same thing to Jim Hopper.

312
00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.200
I want Hawkins' body found.

313
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.200
Sweep pattern. Double back.

314
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.100
50 metres. Let's go.

315
00:46:50.887 --> 00:46:53.389
Come on in, you fuckers.

316
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.702
Come on in.

317
00:46:55.892 --> 00:46:58.302
Old painless is waitin'.

318
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.143
Contact!

319
00:47:35.015 --> 00:47:37.349
Motherfucker!

320
00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:10.675
- What happened?
- I saw it.

321
00:49:10.944 --> 00:49:12.755
- You saw what?
- I saw it.

322
00:49:30.672 --> 00:49:32.207
Blain.

323
00:49:32.507 --> 00:49:36.209
No powder burns, no shrapnel.

324
00:49:36.569 --> 00:49:39.168
The wound's all fused, cauterised.

325
00:49:39.569 --> 00:49:42.124
What the hell
could have done this to a man?

326
00:49:42.517 --> 00:49:43.760
Mac.

327
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.713
Mac, look at me.

328
00:49:46.813 --> 00:49:48.002
Who did this?

329
00:49:48.203 --> 00:49:49.822
I don't know, goddamn it.

330
00:49:49.923 --> 00:49:51.617
I saw something.

331
00:49:55.605 --> 00:49:56.706
Not a thing.

332
00:49:56.807 --> 00:49:58.350
Not a fuckin' trace.

333
00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.243
No blood, no bodies.

334
00:50:00.344 --> 00:50:02.052
We hit nothing.

335
00:50:09.169 --> 00:50:13.505
Dillon, better get on the radio.

336
00:50:14.674 --> 00:50:15.943
Mac.

337
00:50:17.243 --> 00:50:19.245
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:50:19.345 --> 00:50:21.246
I want a defensive position
above that ridge...

339
00:50:21.757 --> 00:50:23.457
mined with everything we've got.

340
00:50:25.894 --> 00:50:28.300
Put him in his poncho.
Take him with us.

341
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:29.509
I got him.

342
00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:38.200
Major, I set up flares,
frags and claymores.

343
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.362
Nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.

344
00:51:42.153 --> 00:51:43.988
Thank you, Sergeant.

345
00:51:45.598 --> 00:51:46.999
Mac.

346
00:51:48.468 --> 00:51:50.328
He was a good soldier.

347
00:51:52.638 --> 00:51:54.173
He was...

348
00:51:55.942 --> 00:51:57.610
my friend.

349
00:53:05.201 --> 00:53:06.811
Goodbye, bro.

350
00:54:14.102 --> 00:54:17.910
Blazer One, I repeat, extraction necessary.

351
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.054
Say again, Blazer One. Say again.

352
00:54:21.254 --> 00:54:23.719
Request for extraction denied.

353
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.633
Area is still compromised.

354
00:54:25.733 --> 00:54:28.328
Proceed to sector 3,000
for prisoner extraction.

355
00:54:28.428 --> 00:54:31.578
Priority, out. Next contact 0930.

356
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.630
Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours.

357
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.230
Damn bastards.

358
00:54:36.936 --> 00:54:39.964
They say we're still in too far.
They can't risk coming in after us.

359
00:54:40.064 --> 00:54:41.669
We're assets, Dillon.

360
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.510
Expendable assets.

361
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.280
It comes with the job. I can accept it.

362
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.948
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.

363
00:54:51.075 --> 00:54:54.520
Shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow?

364
00:54:57.957 --> 00:54:59.057
Sergeant?

365
00:54:59.324 --> 00:55:00.426
Sergeant?

366
00:55:00.626 --> 00:55:01.638
Sergeant!

367
00:55:01.939 --> 00:55:03.562
Who hit us today?

368
00:55:04.255 --> 00:55:05.757
I don't know.

369
00:55:06.257 --> 00:55:08.457
I only saw one of them camouflaged.

370
00:55:09.953 --> 00:55:11.461
He was there.

371
00:55:12.252 --> 00:55:14.156
Those eyes disappeared.

372
00:55:14.509 --> 00:55:16.014
What was that?

373
00:55:16.804 --> 00:55:18.405
Those eyes, they...

374
00:55:18.706 --> 00:55:20.536
they disappeared.

375
00:55:21.364 --> 00:55:23.071
I know one thing, Major...

376
00:55:23.332 --> 00:55:25.393
I drew and fired straight at it.

377
00:55:25.493 --> 00:55:27.999
Capped off 200 rounds in the Minigun.

378
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.981
Full pack.

379
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:34.351
Nothing... nothing on this Earth
could have lived.

380
00:55:35.395 --> 00:55:37.198
Not at that range.

381
00:55:40.233 --> 00:55:43.073
Mac, you take first watch,

382
00:55:43.274 --> 00:55:45.120
then you get some rest.

383
00:55:45.963 --> 00:55:48.461
Ask her.
Ask her what she saw.

384
00:55:48.562 --> 00:55:50.469
Ask her what happened to Hawkins.

385
00:55:51.502 --> 00:55:53.109
Go ahead. Ask her.

386
00:56:02.688 --> 00:56:04.294
She says the same fuckin' thing.

387
00:56:04.395 --> 00:56:06.504
The jungle, it came alive and took him.

388
00:56:07.944 --> 00:56:10.283
Billy, you know something.

389
00:56:10.384 --> 00:56:11.553
What is it?

390
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.300
I'm scared, Poncho.

391
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.300
Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.

392
00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:20.336
There's something out there waiting for us,

393
00:56:21.966 --> 00:56:24.043
and it ain't no man.

394
00:56:32.526 --> 00:56:34.328
We're all gonna die.

395
00:56:37.557 --> 00:56:39.258
Man's losin' it.
He's losing his cool.

396
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:41.258
There's nothing but a couple of guys
running around out there.

397
00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:42.559
And we gotta take 'em down.

398
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:45.060
You still don't understand, Dillon, do you?

399
00:56:45.608 --> 00:56:47.418
Whatever it is out there,

400
00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:49.158
it killed Hopper,

401
00:56:49.759 --> 00:56:51.562
and now it wants us.

402
00:56:57.043 --> 00:56:58.927
Here we are again, bro,

403
00:57:00.428 --> 00:57:02.035
just you and me.

404
00:57:02.615 --> 00:57:05.835
Same kind of moon and same kind of jungle.

405
00:57:06.035 --> 00:57:08.442
Real number 10 night, remember?

406
00:57:09.122 --> 00:57:10.377
Whole platoon,

407
00:57:10.478 --> 00:57:14.243
32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.

408
00:57:14.343 --> 00:57:15.769
Nobody else.

409
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.776
Right on top, bro.

410
00:57:19.048 --> 00:57:21.234
Not a scratch. Not a fuckin' scratch.

411
00:57:21.334 --> 00:57:23.091
You know, whoever got you,

412
00:57:23.292 --> 00:57:24.712
he'll come back again,

413
00:57:24.812 --> 00:57:27.850
and when he does,
I'm gonna cut your name right into him.

414
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:33.078
I'm gonna cut your name into him.

415
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:53.536
- What the hell is it?
- Mac.

416
00:57:56.926 --> 00:57:58.330
- This way.
- Where the hell are you?

417
00:57:58.431 --> 00:58:00.036
- Over here.
- Mac, where are you?

418
00:58:01.899 --> 00:58:03.299
Mac!

419
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:14.800
Mac, where are you?

420
00:58:15.701 --> 00:58:17.308
- Don't fuck with me!
- Mac!

421
00:58:19.209 --> 00:58:21.026
Mac, where are you?

422
00:58:23.196 --> 00:58:26.891
- Jesus.
- I got you, motherfucker.

423
00:58:26.991 --> 00:58:29.602
I killed you, you fuck.

424
00:58:29.702 --> 00:58:33.773
- Jesus. You killed a pig.
- What the...?

425
00:58:33.873 --> 00:58:35.775
Do you think you could have found
something bigger?

426
00:58:35.875 --> 00:58:38.835
Fuck you, Poncho. Fuck you!

427
00:58:40.213 --> 00:58:43.882
- Where's the girl?
- Shit.

428
00:58:44.509 --> 00:58:47.077
Why wasn't anybody watching her?

429
00:58:51.315 --> 00:58:53.213
Why didn't she try to get away?

430
00:58:53.814 --> 00:58:55.027
Look at her.

431
00:58:55.128 --> 00:58:57.187
She's scared out of her mind.

432
00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:00.198
Major, you better take a look at this.

433
00:59:06.372 --> 00:59:08.665
Blain's body, it's gone.

434
00:59:09.667 --> 00:59:11.667
It came in through the tripwires.

435
00:59:12.067 --> 00:59:14.471
Took it right out from under our noses.

436
00:59:28.277 --> 00:59:31.082
That boar had to set off
the trip flare, Major,

437
00:59:31.483 --> 00:59:33.507
cos there ain't no other tracks.

438
00:59:33.607 --> 00:59:35.507
How could anyone get through this

439
00:59:35.608 --> 00:59:37.808
and carry out Blain without us knowing it?

440
00:59:38.137 --> 00:59:40.732
And why didn't he try and kill one of us?

441
00:59:41.532 --> 00:59:43.560
He came in to get the body.

442
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.672
He's killing us one at a time.

443
00:59:46.973 --> 00:59:48.514
Like a hunter.

444
01:00:05.723 --> 01:00:07.725
He's using the trees.

445
01:00:19.028 --> 01:00:21.681
Yesterday, what did you see?

446
01:00:21.781 --> 01:00:24.784
- You're wasting your time.
- No more games.

447
01:00:28.304 --> 01:00:30.174
I don't know what it was.

448
01:00:31.874 --> 01:00:33.885
- It...
- Go on.

449
01:00:34.085 --> 01:00:37.393
It changed colours like the chameleon.

450
01:00:37.493 --> 01:00:39.299
It uses the jungle.

451
01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:43.202
Are you sayin' that Blain and Hawkins
were killed by a fuckin' lizard?

452
01:00:43.302 --> 01:00:44.706
That's a bullshit psych job.

453
01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.614
There's two or three men
out there at the most.

454
01:00:46.714 --> 01:00:48.224
Fucking lizard.

455
01:00:51.227 --> 01:00:52.748
What's your name?

456
01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.162
Anna.

457
01:00:59.276 --> 01:01:00.351
Anna,

458
01:01:00.652 --> 01:01:02.475
this thing is hunting us.

459
01:01:02.905 --> 01:01:04.406
All of us.

460
01:01:05.324 --> 01:01:06.832
You know that.

461
01:01:09.995 --> 01:01:11.625
What the hell do you think
you're you doing?

462
01:01:11.726 --> 01:01:12.748
We're gonna need everyone.

463
01:01:12.848 --> 01:01:15.049
I'm taking her back.
We're out of here in 5 minutes.

464
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.235
We're not going yet.

465
01:01:16.335 --> 01:01:18.235
Look, the rendezvous is
10 to 12 miles away from here.

466
01:01:18.335 --> 01:01:19.530
You think the chopper's gonna wait?

467
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.946
Dillon, we make a stand now,

468
01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:24.552
or there will be nobody left
to go to the chopper.

469
01:01:24.752 --> 01:01:26.559
There is something else.

470
01:01:27.179 --> 01:01:30.758
When the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.

471
01:01:31.058 --> 01:01:33.267
Its blood was on the leaves.

472
01:01:33.727 --> 01:01:36.980
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

473
01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:05.934
Look out.

474
01:02:26.408 --> 01:02:29.504
You really think
this boy-scout bullshit's gonna work.

475
01:02:30.034 --> 01:02:31.736
It can see our tripwires.

476
01:02:31.937 --> 01:02:33.743
Maybe it can't see this.

477
01:02:33.913 --> 01:02:37.449
Instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.

478
01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:38.844
What makes you think
he's gonna come in through here?

479
01:03:39.144 --> 01:03:41.980
There are tripwires
on every tree for 50 yards.

480
01:03:42.081 --> 01:03:43.765
This is the only way in.

481
01:04:10.342 --> 01:04:12.637
When I was little, we found a man.

482
01:04:13.137 --> 01:04:16.682
He looked like... like butchered.

483
01:04:17.182 --> 01:04:19.960
The old women in the village
crossed themselves

484
01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.598
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things,

485
01:04:23.699 --> 01:04:26.199
"El diablo, cazador de hombres."

486
01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:30.121
Only in the hottest years this happens.

487
01:04:33.324 --> 01:04:35.734
And this year it grows hot.

488
01:04:37.536 --> 01:04:39.539
We begin finding our men.

489
01:04:40.539 --> 01:04:43.609
We found them
sometimes without their skin,

490
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:46.910
and sometimes much, much worst.

491
01:04:51.133 --> 01:04:53.936
"El que hace trofeos
de los hombres" means

492
01:04:54.037 --> 01:04:57.164
"the demon who makes trophies of man".

493
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.944
So, what are you gonna try next? Cheese?

494
01:05:23.499 --> 01:05:25.917
Hey, Dutch. Dutch.

495
01:06:34.003 --> 01:06:35.111
Shit.

496
01:07:11.398 --> 01:07:13.925
Got you, motherfucker. I got you.

497
01:07:15.861 --> 01:07:17.413
I'm coming!

498
01:07:18.213 --> 01:07:20.265
Mac! Mac!

499
01:07:20.365 --> 01:07:21.365
Get Ramirez on his feet

500
01:07:21.466 --> 01:07:22.566
- and get to the chopper.
- Right.

501
01:07:22.868 --> 01:07:24.574
Hold it, Dutch. I'm going after Mac.

502
01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:26.188
That's not your style, Dillon.

503
01:07:26.288 --> 01:07:27.888
Guess I picked up some bad habits from you.

504
01:07:27.988 --> 01:07:29.588
Now get your people the hell outta here.

505
01:07:30.107 --> 01:07:31.918
You can't win this, Dillon.

506
01:07:32.908 --> 01:07:34.712
Maybe I can get even.

507
01:07:36.381 --> 01:07:37.608
Dillon.

508
01:07:42.721 --> 01:07:44.756
Just hold on to that damn chopper.

509
01:07:53.065 --> 01:07:55.151
He's busted up pretty bad, Major.

510
01:07:55.651 --> 01:07:58.041
I can make it. I can make it.

511
01:07:58.142 --> 01:08:00.081
- Get the radio. Forget the rest.
- Right.

512
01:08:00.781 --> 01:08:02.081
Come on, Poncho.

513
01:08:02.282 --> 01:08:03.595
Come on, Poncho.

514
01:09:09.308 --> 01:09:10.609
Turn around.

515
01:09:14.813 --> 01:09:16.221
Over here.

516
01:09:21.592 --> 01:09:23.004
Over here.

517
01:09:30.078 --> 01:09:31.438
Mac?

518
01:09:44.885 --> 01:09:46.393
Out there.

519
01:09:47.294 --> 01:09:49.388
Past them trees.

520
01:09:52.017 --> 01:09:53.826
You see it?

521
01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:00.875
I see you.

522
01:10:09.159 --> 01:10:10.744
I see it.

523
01:10:12.704 --> 01:10:14.139
Yeah.

524
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:17.576
I see it.

525
01:10:20.253 --> 01:10:22.274
You know, we can get this thing, Mac.

526
01:10:23.905 --> 01:10:26.118
You work your way down there toward him.

527
01:10:26.218 --> 01:10:27.304
I'll move up around,

528
01:10:27.405 --> 01:10:29.223
get in back of him, flush him toward you.

529
01:10:29.324 --> 01:10:32.191
When I flush that son of a bitch,
you nail him.

530
01:10:32.391 --> 01:10:34.458
I got a score to settle.

531
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:37.771
We've both got scores to settle.

532
01:12:06.693 --> 01:12:08.298
Come on. Quickly.

533
01:12:08.459 --> 01:12:09.471
Hurry up.

534
01:12:09.671 --> 01:12:10.871
Don't. Leave it.

535
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.480
It didn't kill you
because you weren't armed.

536
01:12:13.784 --> 01:12:15.451
No sport.

537
01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:48.451
Mac?

538
01:12:58.261 --> 01:12:59.663
Any time.

539
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.941
Let's go.

540
01:14:28.793 --> 01:14:30.071
Billy.

541
01:14:31.171 --> 01:14:32.981
Billy, let's go.

542
01:14:59.491 --> 01:15:01.134
Give me the weapon.

543
01:15:56.923 --> 01:15:58.829
- No!
- Run!

544
01:16:08.226 --> 01:16:10.313
Run!

545
01:16:10.514 --> 01:16:11.796
Go!

546
01:16:12.096 --> 01:16:14.182
Get to the chopper.

547
01:16:58.818 --> 01:17:00.844
Oh, shit.

548
01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:53.260
He couldn't see me.

549
01:32:07.518 --> 01:32:09.753
Bleed, bastard.

550
01:35:41.732 --> 01:35:45.293
You're one ugly motherfucker.

551
01:36:03.212 --> 01:36:04.695
Bad idea.

552
01:38:03.698 --> 01:38:05.242
Come on.

553
01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:07.011
Come on.

554
01:38:07.112 --> 01:38:09.578
Do it. Do it!

555
01:38:11.923 --> 01:38:13.472
Come on. Come on!

556
01:38:13.573 --> 01:38:16.043
Kill me, I'm here! Kill me!

557
01:38:17.362 --> 01:38:19.224
I'm here. Kill me!

558
01:38:19.525 --> 01:38:22.124
Come on. Kill me! I'm here!

559
01:38:22.267 --> 01:38:25.345
Come on. Do it now. Kill me.

560
01:39:45.642 --> 01:39:47.842
What the hell are you?

561
01:39:51.823 --> 01:39:53.225
What...

562
01:39:53.426 --> 01:39:55.251
the hell...

563
01:39:55.502 --> 01:39:57.707
are you?

564
01:40:59.284 --> 01:41:00.784
Holy shit!

565
01:41:01.985 --> 01:41:04.414
Get in. Come on. OK.

566
01:41:04.615 --> 01:41:05.654
Did you get it?

567
01:41:05.754 --> 01:41:06.754
Got it!

568
01:41:11.361 --> 01:41:12.762
What the...?

569
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:19.300
My God.
