00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:30.584
<i>Last night, the FAA was
forced to ground all aircraft,</i>

2
00:03:30.586 --> 00:03:32.168
<i>leaving thousands stranded</i>

3
00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:35.055
<i>when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages</i>

4
00:03:35.057 --> 00:03:37.046
<i>crippled the west of United States.</i>

5
00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:39.108
<i>But the big story today,</i>

6
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.624
<i>the much-anticipated wedding</i>

7
00:03:40.727 --> 00:03:42.081
<i>of fantastic couple</i>

8
00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.875
<i>The wedding of Reed
Richards and Susan Storm,</i>

9
00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:45.748
<i>will take place this Saturday.</i>

10
00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:50.902
Unbelievable.

11
00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.229
Just there are bizarre anomalies
are occurring all over the world,

12
00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:56.214
defying every known law of physics

13
00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.248
and all the media
want to know about is,

14
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.159
what China pattern Sue
and I picked out.

15
00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:01.559
But which ones did you pick?

16
00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:03.598
The blue ones with them little flowers?

17
00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.039
I really liked them.

18
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:06.708
Excuse me, would you mind?

19
00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:08.386
It's happening again, isn't it?

20
00:04:08.388 --> 00:04:09.267
Yeah, sure.

21
00:04:09.913 --> 00:04:10.710
No.

22
00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:13.358
We are not postponing
anything, not this time.

23
00:04:13.576 --> 00:04:15.867
This is gonna be the wedding
you always dreamed of,

24
00:04:16.027 --> 00:04:17.979
and I'm not gonna let anything
get in the way of that.

25
00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:22.221
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

26
00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:26.370
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

27
00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:30.380
Which is really pathetic,
when you think about it.

28
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.903
Dr. Richards?

29
00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.071
I'm very sorry, but it seems
we're overbooked.

30
00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:36.105
But we do have some seats
available in coach though.

31
00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:37.502
Ok, here we go.

32
00:04:37.943 --> 00:04:38.772
Smile!

33
00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:39.482
Awesome!

34
00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:40.496
Look, Mom!

35
00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:42.131
Hey. Let me get one more.

36
00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:43.563
That should be fine.

37
00:04:47.582 --> 00:04:48.735
That's my seat.

38
00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:51.520
Sorry.

39
00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:06.448
Excuse me.

40
00:05:18.327 --> 00:05:19.602
What do you guys think
about trying to get an

41
00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:21.029
endorsement from an airline?

42
00:05:21.261 --> 00:05:22.475
Get us a private jet?

43
00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.405
I think we have enough
endorsement deals already.

44
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.811
That's funny.

45
00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:28.877
No, but seriously.

46
00:05:29.123 --> 00:05:31.173
Reed it could help you subsidize
all your little inventions.

47
00:05:31.618 --> 00:05:32.753
No, thanks.
Excuse me.

48
00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:35.308
Consider it.

49
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.215
I'll talk to you guys later.
Johnny, where are you going?

50
00:05:38.057 --> 00:05:39.123
I don't fly coach.

51
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.550
I hope it rains.

52
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.630
<i>The snoxfall came with no warning,
no temperature changes,</i>

53
00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:04.105
<i>and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow.</i>

54
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.483
<i>And in Japan, some else suggesting
the solidification of the bay</i>

55
00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:09.727
<i>was due to underwater
volcanic activity.</i>

56
00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.670
<i>Although no such activity
has been reported in the area.</i>

57
00:06:12.825 --> 00:06:14.878
<i>Scientists have ruled
out global warming,</i>

58
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.380
<i>as the cause of the
extraordinary climatic events</i>

59
00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:19.324
<i>being reported around the globe.</i>

60
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.327
<i>With scientists unable to explain
the extraordinary events,</i>

61
00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:25.860
<i>some are beginning to wonder
if the hand of God is at work.</i>

62
00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:27.374
<i>Now in other news,</i>

63
00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:29.871
<i>Reed Richards
and Susan Storm's wedding,</i>

64
00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:31.663
<i>has Manhattan all abuzz.</i>

65
00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:35.087
<i>The guest list includes
many of New York's power elite.</i>

66
00:06:36.742 --> 00:06:37.389
Hey, honey.

67
00:06:38.443 --> 00:06:41.904
The city's trying to charge us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed...

68
00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:43.887
this during that armored car robbery.

69
00:06:43.888 --> 00:06:44.582
But...

70
00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:46.947
I only remember two
squad cars getting thrown.

71
00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:49.410
Reed?

72
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.390
Alright, alright, alright.
I'm putting it away.

73
00:06:55.232 --> 00:06:56.272
You were saying?

74
00:06:56.494 --> 00:06:58.269
I have a fitting in half an hour.

75
00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:00.063
The musicians after that.

76
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.608
I haven't picked out the
place settings or the flowers.

77
00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:04.991
There's too much to do.

78
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.566
Hey. Don't worry about it.

79
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.467
I'm sure between the two of us,
we'll get it all done.

80
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:11.651
And what were you doing
when I just walked in?

81
00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.534
I was inputting my to-do list.

82
00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:14.380
Really?

83
00:07:14.673 --> 00:07:15.604
Scout's honor.

84
00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:16.544
Hey, guys.

85
00:07:16.822 --> 00:07:18.162
The new uniforms just showed up.

86
00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:19.350
What do you think?

87
00:07:22.127 --> 00:07:24.530
I think there is no way
we're wearing that, Johnny.

88
00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:28.006
What do you have against capitalism?

89
00:07:30.826 --> 00:07:31.743
What's this?

90
00:07:32.544 --> 00:07:34.400
Just a little hobby of mine.
Yeah?

91
00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:37.349
Would it make a good toy,
or is it something...

92
00:07:37.876 --> 00:07:38.884
science-y?

93
00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:39.716
A little of both.

94
00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.909
You know, I've always been both
impressed and disgusted at that.

95
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:47.558
Yeah.

96
00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.504
Sue says I'm addicted to it.

97
00:07:49.872 --> 00:07:51.200
I wonder why she'd say that.

98
00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:52.778
Hey, Johnny.

99
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.771
Keep it quiet but...

100
00:07:56.313 --> 00:07:58.971
I've cross-referenced and
analyzed the global disturbances.

101
00:08:00.495 --> 00:08:04.330
They're being caused by cosmic radiation
not unlike the kind which gave us our powers.

102
00:08:05.207 --> 00:08:07.122
That's really boring.

103
00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:08.487
So listen,

104
00:08:08.489 --> 00:08:11.048
I have a very important wedding
issue we need to talk about.

105
00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:13.132
Yeah, of course.

106
00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:15.196
Your bachelor party.

107
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.772
No. Seriously, Johnny.

108
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:19.720
John.

109
00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:23.432
Focus testing showed that
Johnny skewed a little young.

110
00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:26.040
Seriously Johnny, no bachelor party.

111
00:08:26.281 --> 00:08:27.758
It's not my kind of thing.

112
00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:30.184
Then do it for Ben.

113
00:08:30.346 --> 00:08:32.774
It means a lot to the big guy.
You're gonna break his heart.

114
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.986
He does have some
sort of rock like heart, doesn't he?

115
00:08:36.052 --> 00:08:37.620
I've got too much to do
before the wedding,

116
00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:40.405
Frankly, I think Sue might have
a problem with it.

117
00:08:41.772 --> 00:08:43.791
You know what Sue
would have a problem with?

118
00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:45.859
If somebody told her,

119
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.531
that you were actually investigating,

120
00:08:47.533 --> 00:08:49.783
global disturbances
and cosmic radiation,

121
00:08:49.785 --> 00:08:51.951
instead of focusing on the wedding,

122
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.541
like you promised.

123
00:09:05.772 --> 00:09:07.772
A bachelor party could be fun.
Yes!

124
00:09:07.836 --> 00:09:09.337
But no exotic dancers.

125
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.619
This is it?

126
00:09:58.032 --> 00:09:59.661
I don't know anybody here.

127
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.373
I would have invited some of your friends,
but you don't have any.

128
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.104
Hey!

129
00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:06.358
Johnny, we had a deal.

130
00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:08.890
They're not exotic dancers.

131
00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:11.862
They're just hot.

132
00:10:15.453 --> 00:10:17.461
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?

133
00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:19.486
That's so awesome.

134
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:25.070
You're really cute.

135
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.238
I'm gonna need a pitcher with
the biggest handle you've got.

136
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.415
No problem.

137
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.129
Good evening,
and welcome to the Baxter...

138
00:10:49.906 --> 00:10:51.266
Could I help you?

139
00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:53.454
No, you can't use that elev...

140
00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:01.988
Ms. Storm will be with your shortly.

141
00:11:05.362 --> 00:11:06.187
Hello?

142
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:08.129
Thanks, Roberta.

143
00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:12.561
May I help you?

144
00:11:12.859 --> 00:11:14.181
We're here to see Dr. Richards.

145
00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:15.998
I'm sorry. He's not here right now.

146
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.187
Is there anything I can help you with?

147
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:17.946
Yes.

148
00:11:18.182 --> 00:11:19.892
You can take me to see Dr. Richards.

149
00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:22.813
Ok.

150
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:32.490
Sorry.

151
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.261
When the universe began,
it was no bigger than a marble.

152
00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:39.221
Then, bang!

153
00:11:39.857 --> 00:11:40.690
It exploded.

154
00:11:41.057 --> 00:11:42.732
And in a trillionth of a second...

155
00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:46.209
it expanded exponentially to what
became the universe we know today.

156
00:11:47.554 --> 00:11:49.399
You're really smart.

157
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.547
Well, thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

158
00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:55.189
I love this song. Wanna dance?

159
00:11:55.235 --> 00:11:56.695
Oh no, I don't really.
Yes, you do.

160
00:11:56.697 --> 00:11:59.129
No, no, honestly.
Come on, you'll be great.

161
00:11:59.172 --> 00:12:00.811
I don't want to embarrass you guys.

162
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.360
Just loosen up.

163
00:12:13.495 --> 00:12:14.838
Have some fun.

164
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.559
That's it.

165
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:18.457
Yeah.

166
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.742
That's it.

167
00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:34.327
Guy really knows how to loosen up.

168
00:12:34.497 --> 00:12:35.521
You're not kidding.

169
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.074
There he is.

170
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.464
Yes.

171
00:13:03.486 --> 00:13:04.650
Unfortunately.

172
00:13:11.276 --> 00:13:11.979
For him.

173
00:13:15.912 --> 00:13:16.769
Shall we?

174
00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.831
Think it might be clobbering time.

175
00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:26.678
Sue?

176
00:13:27.202 --> 00:13:28.269
What are you...

177
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.407
General Hager.

178
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:35.210
Let's talk somewhere private.

179
00:13:36.144 --> 00:13:38.579
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

180
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.356
I was just explaining to the girls about...

181
00:13:42.786 --> 00:13:44.301
how the big bang led to...

182
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.631
This was Johnny's idea. I just...

183
00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:48.506
went along.

184
00:13:50.203 --> 00:13:52.051
How does Reed know the general?

185
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.349
A few years back, the guy was trying
to push a new missile defense system.

186
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:58.879
Reed testified that the technology
would not work.

187
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:01.864
I'm only here Richards, because I'm under
direct orders from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

188
00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:03.780
Personally, I don't like the idea of sharing,

189
00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:06.003
sensitive information
with a civilian scientist.

190
00:14:06.376 --> 00:14:07.925
Especially one who enjoys the...

191
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.740
public spotlight so much.

192
00:14:10.256 --> 00:14:12.025
Always a pleasure
to see you too, general.

193
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:15.220
What can I do for you?

194
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.793
As you may know, there have been recent
unusual occurrences all over the world.

195
00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:21.906
Officially, we've downplayed
their significance to the public,

196
00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:23.291
but we're concerned that these...

197
00:14:24.026 --> 00:14:25.313
anomalies,

198
00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:27.770
might pose a credible threat
to our national security.

199
00:14:28.345 --> 00:14:30.621
These were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago.

200
00:14:34.817 --> 00:14:35.570
What is it?

201
00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:38.010
We were hoping Dr. Richards
could tell us.

202
00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.766
I'm afraid I've never seen anything like it.

203
00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:41.892
Ben?

204
00:14:43.893 --> 00:14:47.450
Well, I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

205
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.924
This thing's giving off its own energy.

206
00:14:50.278 --> 00:14:51.427
Take a look at this.

207
00:14:51.953 --> 00:14:53.785
These have been appearing
in remote areas throughout

208
00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:55.188
the world since the events started.

209
00:14:56.353 --> 00:14:59.164
Field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters.

210
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.036
If we're gonna find out
what this is all about,

211
00:15:02.038 --> 00:15:04.760
we need a way to locate
and intercept that object.

212
00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:07.507
It'd be possible to build a sensor,

213
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:09.801
tie it into the Baxter
building satellite grid

214
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.315
and we can pinpoint
the exact location of the object.

215
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.823
Good, so then you'll build
the sensor for us,

216
00:15:14.825 --> 00:15:16.971
we'll tie that to the...
I'm afraid I can't.

217
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.144
What?

218
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.933
You see, I'm getting married
this Saturday.

219
00:15:23.543 --> 00:15:24.757
I just don't have the time.

220
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.912
Richards,

221
00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:30.549
your country needs your help.

222
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.336
Look, why don't you call
Professor Jeff Wagner?

223
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.778
He's head of the Physics
Department at Brown.

224
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.536
I'm sure he can help you.

225
00:15:37.623 --> 00:15:39.190
I expected more, Richards.

226
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.267
Even from you.

227
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.988
John Storm,

228
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.529
Fantastic Four lncorporated.

229
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.407
You ever done any
professional modeling?

230
00:16:01.409 --> 00:16:02.224
Not interested.

231
00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:03.535
Because you got
an amazing complexion.

232
00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:04.626
Not interested.

233
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.767
And you...

234
00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:11.118
just walked away.

235
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.649
I was definitely still talking.

236
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.013
I can't believe you just turned down
a science project.

237
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.934
They can build a sensor without me.

238
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.369
The most important thing right now
is our wedding.

239
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.717
No postponements. No interruptions.

240
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.961
Thank you.

241
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.481
And look,

242
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:31.921
about what you saw back at the bar...

243
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.207
Don't worry about it.

244
00:16:33.495 --> 00:16:35.053
I know you.

245
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.066
I'm glad you had fun.

246
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.204
Thank you.

247
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.682
Besides...

248
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.914
it was nothing compared to what
I did at my bachelorette party.

249
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.520
Talk about wild.

250
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.459
Wild?

251
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.540
Come on.

252
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.824
Hey, what are you doing up here?

253
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.479
Nothing. Just...

254
00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:43.806
needed some air.

255
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.297
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

256
00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.050
I'm guessing Susie
doesn't know anything about it.

257
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.190
Don't worry,

258
00:17:51.918 --> 00:17:53.073
my lips are sealed.

259
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.220
That is, they would be if I had any.

260
00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.899
Look, don't tell Johnny.

261
00:18:01.082 --> 00:18:02.125
Don't tell Johnny what?

262
00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:03.601
Great.

263
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.292
Are you building that thing?

264
00:18:05.411 --> 00:18:06.154
No, it's...

265
00:18:07.202 --> 00:18:09.348
If Sue finds out, you'll get
an invisible kick in the nuts.

266
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.315
Hey, hey. We're
keeping this quiet.

267
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:12.476
I know.

268
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.852
Don't worry.

269
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.116
<i>They're calling it the
wedding of the century.</i>

270
00:18:17.118 --> 00:18:19.205
<i>Reed Richards and Susan Storm...</i>

271
00:18:19.207 --> 00:18:22.809
<i>also know as Mr. Fantastic
and the Invisible Woman,</i>

272
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:27.082
<i>will try again to tie the knot today
in a ceremony in New York.</i>

273
00:18:37.415 --> 00:18:39.292
Look at these parasites.

274
00:18:39.637 --> 00:18:40.592
Unbelievable.

275
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:42.340
Have they no shame?

276
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:47.167
Hey! Hey, listen!

277
00:18:47.169 --> 00:18:48.391
Listen, everybody!

278
00:18:48.468 --> 00:18:50.624
This is a very special
day for my sister,

279
00:18:50.626 --> 00:18:52.335
probably the most
important day of her life.

280
00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.394
So I just want to say to you guys,

281
00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:56.261
please respect our privacy.

282
00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.061
Come on, Johnny.

283
00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.253
I'm just kidding.

284
00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:02.778
We're auctioning off
the exclusive wedding photos,

285
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.854
to the highest bidder, so go online,

286
00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:06.816
and place your bids. Thank you.

287
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.697
Johnny, are you planning...

288
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:10.960
So, what's it take to date
the Human Torch?

289
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.340
Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.

290
00:19:14.693 --> 00:19:15.491
Thank you.

291
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.679
Are you alright?
How are you?

292
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.208
Invitation, sir?

293
00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.360
I should be on that list.

294
00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.351
Name?
Stan Lee.

295
00:19:41.826 --> 00:19:43.366
Yeah, nice try, buddy.

296
00:19:43.454 --> 00:19:45.454
No, really. I'm Stan Lee.
Nice try.

297
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.244
This isn't how I imagined it.

298
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.596
It never is.

299
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.240
No Alicia,

300
00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:58.139
it just doesn't feel right.

301
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.124
Sweetie...

302
00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:06.965
I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding-day jitters.

303
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.673
It's more than that.

304
00:20:09.173 --> 00:20:11.066
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

305
00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.316
Do we really want to raise kids
in all this?

306
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.260
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

307
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.385
Ben and I aren't normal...

308
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.429
but we don't let it
get in the way of us being happy.

309
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.639
Do you love Reed?

310
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.883
More than I've ever loved anyone.

311
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.897
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

312
00:20:38.256 --> 00:20:39.215
Thank you.

313
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:50.012
Ok.

314
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.964
Oh, great.
What?

315
00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.269
I've got a zit.

316
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.610
Have you got any make-up?

317
00:20:56.612 --> 00:20:57.810
No, no, I got it.

318
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.694
There, crisis averted

319
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.640
Now all I have to do is concentrate on
that area continuously for the next 8 hours.

320
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.026
Reed, come on.

321
00:21:11.151 --> 00:21:12.606
You're gonna miss your own wedding.

322
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.777
Just a minute.

323
00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.461
Almost done.

324
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.627
General,

325
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.454
I'm putting the sensor online...

326
00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:24.888
now.

327
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.153
There.

328
00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:33.950
If there is a surge in cosmic radiation,

329
00:21:33.952 --> 00:21:35.660
anywhere on the planet,
you'll know about it.

330
00:21:35.714 --> 00:21:36.656
<i>Let's hope so, Richards.</i>

331
00:21:36.945 --> 00:21:38.851
<i>We've already gotten reports
of two more craters.</i>

332
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.560
Here comes the bride

333
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.310
Alright, alright, alright,
just linking it to my P.D.A.

334
00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.127
Reed.
And...

335
00:21:45.938 --> 00:21:46.843
that's it.

336
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.288
Good, that's great.

337
00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.991
Now shave and put on your tux.

338
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.450
You're getting married
and you look like a bum.

339
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.726
Absolutely.

340
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.174
What?

341
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.224
I'm getting married.

342
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.363
Oh, jeez.

343
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.554
I'm getting married.

344
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.833
I heard of getting cold feet...

345
00:22:22.213 --> 00:22:22.845
Hey.

346
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.163
Hey, Johnny.

347
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.409
Does that amaze anyone else?

348
00:22:29.411 --> 00:22:31.531
How did she know it was me?
I didn't say anything!

349
00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.780
Well to be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

350
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.076
You're late.

351
00:22:36.078 --> 00:22:37.951
Let's not make today about me.

352
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.700
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

353
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.321
Let's give them the attention
for a change.

354
00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.290
Don't do that.

355
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.684
Ok, you're perfect.
You're perfect.

356
00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:53.775
I'll see you upstairs.

357
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.474
Bye, Johnny.

358
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.486
So, it seems like you
and Alicia are doing well.

359
00:23:01.823 --> 00:23:03.067
Annoyingly so, in fact.

360
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.440
Yeah, I'm a lucky guy.

361
00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:07.060
Yeah, you are.

362
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.340
Question for you, though.

363
00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:11.909
How do you guys...

364
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.286
That's none of your business!
Ok. Alright, I'm just concerned

365
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.928
I'd hate to wake up one morning and
find out she was killed in a rock slide.

366
00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:24.169
I'll show you a rock slide!

367
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.440
What are you?

368
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.937
Thank you.

369
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.688
Johnny?

370
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:03.851
You should not tease him so much..

371
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.538
It was a joke.

372
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.150
I don't know,

373
00:24:07.152 --> 00:24:09.754
I think it bothers you to see
him really happy and in love.

374
00:24:10.393 --> 00:24:11.824
I think you're jealous.

375
00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:13.753
You think I'm jealous?

376
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.642
Have you seen the women I've dated?

377
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.457
No.

378
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.365
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

379
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.615
Ta-da!

380
00:24:25.971 --> 00:24:27.033
Hey!

381
00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:28.789
It's the bride of stretchy man.

382
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.810
Don't start.

383
00:24:30.115 --> 00:24:31.737
Don't listen to him.
You look gorgeous.

384
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.225
We'll see you out there, sweetie.

385
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.430
Come on.

386
00:24:34.822 --> 00:24:36.901
We're on.
Ok. Ok.

387
00:24:40.869 --> 00:24:43.048
You know, you don't look
completely ridiculous in that dress.

388
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.529
Is that obnoxious brother talk
for you look kind of nice?

389
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.490
You look beautiful.

390
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.124
Thank you.

391
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.958
Dad would be proud.

392
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:16.057
Yeah.

393
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.919
Reed, will you shut your cell phone off?

394
00:25:43.927 --> 00:25:45.123
Actually, this is a...

395
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.200
Dearly beloved,

396
00:26:27.358 --> 00:26:29.587
we are gathered here today to...

397
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.710
<i>Sue and Reed,</i>

398
00:26:32.953 --> 00:26:34.971
<i>congratulations on your wedding!</i>

399
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.742
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

400
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:40.240
Dearly beloved,

401
00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:43.321
we are gathered here today
to join this couple,

402
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.190
Reed Richards and Susan Storm,
together...

403
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.830
in the bond of holy...

404
00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.164
matri...

405
00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:57.025
mony.

406
00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.850
I can't believe you
brought that to our wedding.

407
00:26:59.888 --> 00:27:01.779
I know, but there is a good reason.

408
00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.395
We have to get through this quickly.

409
00:27:03.397 --> 00:27:04.817
That's romantic.

410
00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.194
Should I continue?

411
00:27:07.281 --> 00:27:08.396
Yes, please.

412
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.362
There are many kinds of love.

413
00:27:11.364 --> 00:27:13.086
Could you skip to the end, please?

414
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.420
Reed.

415
00:27:14.617 --> 00:27:15.796
Excuse me?

416
00:27:25.105 --> 00:27:26.503
What's going on?
What happened?

417
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.914
We've lost power!

418
00:27:40.916 --> 00:27:42.566
We're going down!
We're going down!

419
00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:45.188
It's too late.

420
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.224
Pull up!
I'm trying! I'm trying!

421
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.085
Ben!

422
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.293
Johnny.

423
00:28:28.618 --> 00:28:29.702
This is Dolce.

424
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.140
Flame on!

425
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.368
Man, he's fast.

426
00:29:05.095 --> 00:29:06.318
That is cool.

427
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.940
Hey, taxi!
Oh, man!

428
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:37.472
Showoff.

429
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.430
Time to end this.

430
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.430
Can we talk?

431
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.702
Ok,

432
00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:28.400
you win.

433
00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.255
Flame on!

434
00:30:38.655 --> 00:30:39.590
Come on!

435
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.942
Flame on!

436
00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:05.664
Hey.

437
00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:20.809
Your herald summons you.

438
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.709
Another world awaits.

439
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.163
Let it be done quickly.

440
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.437
It looked like a man,

441
00:31:33.607 --> 00:31:36.493
but completely covered in silver,
and it was flying this like...

442
00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.160
like a surfboard type thing.
I know that sounds crazy.

443
00:31:40.287 --> 00:31:42.152
Oh no, not at all.

444
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.140
So did you follow the shiny man

445
00:31:44.142 --> 00:31:46.279
to the Lollipop Land
or to Rainbow Junction?

446
00:31:46.482 --> 00:31:48.330
Look I know what I saw.
Thank you.

447
00:31:48.916 --> 00:31:49.962
It's alright, Johnny.

448
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.587
Whatever this thing's
physical appearance is,

449
00:31:52.589 --> 00:31:55.011
it has the ability
to convert matter and energy.

450
00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.791
So it caused the anomalies?

451
00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:00.188
It seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself,

452
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.872
randomly affecting matter.

453
00:32:01.874 --> 00:32:03.056
Evidently this...

454
00:32:03.447 --> 00:32:04.757
entity, this...

455
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.817
Silver Surfer...

456
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.513
didn't want to be detected. It...

457
00:32:11.306 --> 00:32:12.691
destroyed the sensor.

458
00:32:13.112 --> 00:32:14.535
It knew it was being monitored?

459
00:32:14.537 --> 00:32:16.201
And traced it back here.

460
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.610
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

461
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:23.505
Are you feeling ok?

462
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.524
Yeah.

463
00:32:24.643 --> 00:32:26.808
I just... l got to walk this off.

464
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.250
We have to destroy this thing
before it attacks again.

465
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.538
Richards find me another way
to track it.

466
00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.035
Sue, I am so sorry.

467
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.165
The only reason I didn't tell you about it,

468
00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:48.418
is because I didn't want you to worry.

469
00:32:48.462 --> 00:32:50.229
I'm not mad that you built the sensor.

470
00:32:50.231 --> 00:32:51.633
It was the right thing to do.

471
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:52.593
Oh, great.

472
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:57.688
I wasn't finished.

473
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.620
Ok. Sorry. Please continue.

474
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.506
See, this proves exactly what
I've been saying all along.

475
00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:07.976
Could you drop the force field, please?

476
00:33:07.978 --> 00:33:09.521
We can't even...
Sorry.

477
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.698
We can't even have a wedding without it
turning into World War three.

478
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:14.464
I know.

479
00:33:15.142 --> 00:33:17.758
But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

480
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.987
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

481
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.561
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

482
00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.940
I'm going...
I'm going to go check on Johnny.

483
00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:45.425
Johnny?

484
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.285
Hey, are you alright, pal?

485
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:57.900
Are you alright?

486
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.293
Johnny?

487
00:34:03.314 --> 00:34:04.592
Johnny, are you ok?

488
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.872
I don't know.

489
00:34:07.753 --> 00:34:10.021
I feel really strange since
my run-in with surfer boy.

490
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.024
Maybe we should get you checked out.

491
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.205
Why did you do that?

492
00:34:15.207 --> 00:34:16.531
I didn't do anything!

493
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.297
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!

494
00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.583
Oh, my God, Sue!

495
00:34:21.957 --> 00:34:22.574
Just...

496
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:25.397
Just hang on! I'll get you, ok?

497
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.892
Flame on!

498
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.405
Hey, watch it.

499
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.509
Reed!

500
00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.925
Reed!

501
00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.062
Reed!

502
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.762
Help!
Sue?

503
00:34:40.856 --> 00:34:42.877
I'm on fire! Help!

504
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.845
Sue!

505
00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:46.101
What's going on?
I'm on fire!

506
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:48.310
You're on fire!
You think?

507
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:49.264
Hold on!

508
00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:51.002
Pull me in! Help!

509
00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:55.524
Hey, it's the Human Torch!

510
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:57.320
Johnny! Johnny!

511
00:34:57.322 --> 00:34:58.376
I'm not Johnny!

512
00:34:58.378 --> 00:34:59.991
Sue, how did this happen?

513
00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.700
I touched Johnny and then, this.

514
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:04.780
Where is Johnny?
Here.

515
00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.765
Try it again.

516
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.283
Nice to see.

517
00:35:14.298 --> 00:35:15.577
Hey, get out of there.

518
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.589
Sue your clothes.

519
00:35:20.108 --> 00:35:22.143
Why does this always happen to me?

520
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:25.800
All of Sue's results are normal.

521
00:35:26.058 --> 00:35:27.078
But Johnny's...

522
00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.874
Johnny's are what?

523
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.506
Your encounter with the Surfer
has affected your molecules,

524
00:35:32.508 --> 00:35:34.811
they're in a constant state of flux.

525
00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.667
Is that bad?

526
00:35:40.243 --> 00:35:42.833
Well, it caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

527
00:35:42.948 --> 00:35:45.837
Ideally, I'd like to run some more tests.
Would you like a volunteer?

528
00:35:45.859 --> 00:35:47.069
No, no, hey!
No, no, no!

529
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:48.348
No, no, hey!

530
00:35:48.568 --> 00:35:49.660
This is serious!

531
00:35:50.385 --> 00:35:51.965
I just wanted to give him a hug.

532
00:35:52.088 --> 00:35:54.168
We don't know the extent
of his condition yet.

533
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.111
It could be progressive.
It could be degenerative.

534
00:35:56.113 --> 00:35:57.589
It could be fun.
No, Ben!

535
00:35:58.295 --> 00:35:58.993
Ben!

536
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:00.733
Hey.

537
00:36:01.375 --> 00:36:02.424
Hey, it's me!

538
00:36:02.652 --> 00:36:03.767
I'm back!

539
00:36:12.335 --> 00:36:14.551
Oh, my God!

540
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.823
Come on!

541
00:36:16.992 --> 00:36:18.518
We just said this is serious!

542
00:36:18.606 --> 00:36:20.533
Oh, yeah, serious.

543
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.200
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

544
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:27.904
Hey, not bad.

545
00:36:27.984 --> 00:36:29.246
Incredible.

546
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.246
Reed,

547
00:36:30.365 --> 00:36:32.454
you better be able to fix this!
I'm right on it.

548
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:34.881
Ben, stop it that!!

549
00:36:34.883 --> 00:36:36.461
I'm starting to see why you like that..

550
00:36:37.501 --> 00:36:39.258
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

551
00:36:42.658 --> 00:36:43.550
Crap.

552
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.790
That's not funny.

553
00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:46.801
What am I supposed to do
in the meantime?

554
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.550
Just try to keep your distance from us.

555
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:55.694
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal!

556
00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.293
<i>My inside sources are telling me that</i>

557
00:37:07.295 --> 00:37:09.239
<i>the unlucky bride-to-be Sue Storm,</i>

558
00:37:09.453 --> 00:37:11.028
<i>turned invisible,</i>

559
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.682
<i>and it seems she's staying that way
after yesterday's embarrassing fiasco.</i>

560
00:37:15.012 --> 00:37:17.040
<i>Coming up next, the Invisible Woman's,</i>

561
00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:18.887
<i>greatest fashion blunders,</i>

562
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.939
<i>and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

563
00:37:23.195 --> 00:37:23.903
Sue...

564
00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.251
Why do you keep watching this?

565
00:37:26.624 --> 00:37:27.631
Just ignore it.

566
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.354
I can't ignore it, Reed.

567
00:37:29.515 --> 00:37:31.134
There's no getting away from it!

568
00:37:31.162 --> 00:37:32.340
I believe there is.

569
00:37:32.342 --> 00:37:33.283
How?

570
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:35.784
See?

571
00:37:36.394 --> 00:37:37.610
No answer.

572
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.223
Yes, there is.

573
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:43.886
What if...

574
00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:45.916
after this crisis is over...

575
00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.100
we leave it all behind?

576
00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:50.856
What are you talking about?

577
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.689
We move out of the Baxter Building.

578
00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.586
I'll take a teaching position somewhere.

579
00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.603
Get back to my research.

580
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:02.200
And the two of us will live out lives
and raise a family like normal people.

581
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.177
You would do that?

582
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.965
Nothing is more important to me
than our future together.

583
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.372
Oh, thank you.

584
00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.348
What about Ben and Johnny?

585
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.596
Well, they'll understand.

586
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.770
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

587
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.305
Let's not mention it to them yet.

588
00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.694
Johnny's got enough
to worry about as it is,

589
00:38:30.696 --> 00:38:32.470
with his power problems.

590
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.079
You've been busy, my friend.

591
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.978
Your talents...

592
00:39:35.277 --> 00:39:36.518
are impressive.

593
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.760
Can you understand what I'm saying?

594
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:45.828
Together,

595
00:39:46.111 --> 00:39:47.682
we could be unstoppable.

596
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.030
Anything would be ours for the taking.

597
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.570
All that you know is at an end.

598
00:39:55.825 --> 00:39:57.259
What do you mean by that?

599
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.051
Wait!

600
00:39:59.573 --> 00:40:01.248
I said, wait!

601
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:27.214
They're breaking up the team.

602
00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:29.481
Reed and Sue, I just overheard them.

603
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.938
They want a nice, normal,
boring ass life.

604
00:40:31.988 --> 00:40:33.385
No more Fantastic Four.

605
00:40:33.387 --> 00:40:34.278
Well...

606
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.385
what do they expect us to do,
keep it going, just the three of us?

607
00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:40.070
And call ourselves what?
The Dynamic Duo?

608
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.064
When were they gonna tell us?

609
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.618
They'll tell you when
they're ready to tell you.

610
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.930
It's their decision, not yours.

611
00:40:47.626 --> 00:40:50.389
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

612
00:40:52.364 --> 00:40:53.252
Guys.

613
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.007
We've got a serious problem.

614
00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.865
I cross referenced the Surfer's radiation
through every astronomical database.

615
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.236
Altair 7,

616
00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:03.870
Rigel 3,

617
00:41:03.942 --> 00:41:04.792
Vega 6.

618
00:41:04.895 --> 00:41:06.536
He's been to all these planets?

619
00:41:06.538 --> 00:41:07.936
And now they're lifeless.

620
00:41:08.018 --> 00:41:10.123
Barren. Some even shattered.

621
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:11.817
Everywhere the Surfer goes,

622
00:41:12.098 --> 00:41:14.494
eight days later, the planet dies.

623
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.044
How are we gonna stop him?

624
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.501
We don't even know where he is.

625
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:25.660
What about the craters?

626
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.756
They appear in a numerical sequence.

627
00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.540
The last crater was formed
in Greenland so...

628
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.673
The next in the sequence should be...

629
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.763
latitude 51 degrees, 30 minutes north...

630
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.728
longitude,

631
00:41:45.331 --> 00:41:47.772
0 degrees, 7 minutes west.

632
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.936
When he surfaces,

633
00:42:01.971 --> 00:42:03.723
you've got to move the fight
away from the crowd.

634
00:42:03.725 --> 00:42:05.494
No, he's too fast to be contained.

635
00:42:05.496 --> 00:42:07.029
When I see silver, I'm hitting him!

636
00:42:07.031 --> 00:42:08.308
Wait, you can't do that.

637
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.028
We've got to stick
to the plan and work as a team.

638
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:12.091
Oh, so we're a team now?
That's news to me.

639
00:42:12.093 --> 00:42:13.001
What are you talking about?

640
00:42:13.003 --> 00:42:14.617
You know what I'm talking about.

641
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:16.323
Look, we were gonna tell you guys...

642
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:17.160
When were you gonna tell us,

643
00:42:17.162 --> 00:42:18.944
when you moved our stuff
out of the Baxter Building?

644
00:42:18.946 --> 00:42:20.533
Johnny, this really isn't a good time.

645
00:42:20.619 --> 00:42:22.041
Kid's got a point, Reed.

646
00:42:22.043 --> 00:42:23.060
You should have told us.

647
00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:24.451
Alright, alright!
That's enough!

648
00:42:24.453 --> 00:42:25.664
We'll talk about this later.

649
00:42:25.666 --> 00:42:27.307
What the hell is wrong with you people?

650
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.350
It's a whirlpool!

651
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.280
Oh, my God.

652
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.023
Get out! Get out!

653
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.803
Don't let go!

654
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.015
Move!
Come on! Go!

655
00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.267
No, Johnny!

656
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:19.214
Guys?

657
00:44:19.551 --> 00:44:21.099
What are you doing?

658
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.536
Ben! Lift it higher!

659
00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.050
I'll try.

660
00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:04.970
Sue!

661
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.786
Stay back,

662
00:45:13.155 --> 00:45:14.685
before you get somebody killed.

663
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:19.310
Oh, my God.

664
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.397
What the hell was that?

665
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.984
We'll make adjustments.
Next time, we'll be ready.

666
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:45.422
Next time?

667
00:45:46.414 --> 00:45:47.761
There's no next time.

668
00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.034
You can't handle this alone.

669
00:45:50.636 --> 00:45:52.011
That's why I'm bringing in some help.

670
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.348
General, if you bring in
more soldiers and weaponry,

671
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.035
you're gonna put innocent
people in danger.

672
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.893
No more than you already have.

673
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:04.652
Victor?

674
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:06.865
What's the matter?

675
00:46:07.404 --> 00:46:08.475
Afraid of ghosts?

676
00:46:09.817 --> 00:46:10.663
Ben!

677
00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:12.244
Don't move!

678
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.571
Since you're a ghost,

679
00:46:13.573 --> 00:46:15.917
you won't mind
if I break your little neck

680
00:46:16.484 --> 00:46:18.120
Let him go.
Don't you know who that is?

681
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:20.343
He's Victor Von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

682
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:28.954
Ben, let him go.

683
00:46:32.807 --> 00:46:34.163
How is this possible?

684
00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:38.025
How are you still alive?

685
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.436
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

686
00:46:42.324 --> 00:46:44.076
Von Doom's made contact
with the alien.

687
00:46:44.455 --> 00:46:45.995
He's got valuable information.

688
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.842
Information that might
just help save the planet.

689
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:51.370
Now, let's be clear about this.

690
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:52.847
Shall we?

691
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.740
I hate you.

692
00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:58.332
All of you.

693
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.146
But, the world's at stake and...

694
00:47:02.914 --> 00:47:04.797
we need to work together to survive.

695
00:47:05.461 --> 00:47:07.129
General, we know firsthand,

696
00:47:07.131 --> 00:47:09.591
you trust Victor
and you're gonna regret it.

697
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.583
So far the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you...

698
00:47:12.795 --> 00:47:13.631
Richards.

699
00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:17.478
Reed, don't agree to this.

700
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:24.878
Let's see what he's got.

701
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.462
I made a detailed recording...

702
00:47:27.839 --> 00:47:29.005
of our little encounter.

703
00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.150
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

704
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.933
Well...

705
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:39.740
I like the part where
he knocks you on your ass.

706
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:45.971
Look at where the energy levels
surge when he attacks me.

707
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.710
There, you see it happening?

708
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.260
The energy was channeled through him,
but it originated from his board.

709
00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.374
If we can separate him from the board,

710
00:48:00.092 --> 00:48:01.920
we can cut off his power completely.

711
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.911
And that's what we have to do.

712
00:48:03.913 --> 00:48:04.641
How?

713
00:48:04.854 --> 00:48:07.372
If I knew that,
I would not need you people, would I?

714
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.077
You two should get started right away.

715
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.596
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

716
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.069
I'll try to talk slowly,

717
00:48:25.164 --> 00:48:26.464
so you can keep up.

718
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.569
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

719
00:48:35.643 --> 00:48:36.745
You got me pal.

720
00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:39.565
Things were a lot simpler when
I could just whale on the guy

721
00:48:40.658 --> 00:48:42.291
What's he doing? A fire.

722
00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.203
Look at that.

723
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:49.328
I'll pay for that.

724
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.552
I got to tell you Ben,

725
00:48:53.049 --> 00:48:54.870
I'm starting to feel like
a complete screw-up.

726
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:57.897
Hey, hey, you're not
a complete screw-up.

727
00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:58.987
Thank you.

728
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.392
Look kid,

729
00:49:00.469 --> 00:49:01.758
it's out of our hands.

730
00:49:02.386 --> 00:49:03.975
It's up to the eggheads now.

731
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:05.416
You think Reed's right.

732
00:49:06.178 --> 00:49:07.868
About the whole end-of-the-world thing?

733
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.327
He's never been wrong
about this kind of thing before.

734
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.044
You know, I'm not exactly
a deep kind of guy.

735
00:49:15.302 --> 00:49:16.324
Really?

736
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.738
But if Reed's right...

737
00:49:19.864 --> 00:49:21.135
and this is it...

738
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.288
how would you want to spend
your last few minutes?

739
00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.576
Part of me would like to go out fighting.

740
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:34.124
But the truth is...

741
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.947
I'd like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding Alicia.

742
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.225
That sounds pretty good.

743
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.641
I mean not, the holding Alicia thing
that's you know.

744
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.267
She's your girlfriend, not mine.

745
00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:49.822
I want nothing to do with her.
Not to say she's not attractive.

746
00:49:49.824 --> 00:49:50.704
She's very attractive.

747
00:49:50.706 --> 00:49:51.874
I mean she's you know...

748
00:49:52.116 --> 00:49:53.318
so attractive.

749
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:54.781
Even with the... you know.

750
00:49:55.156 --> 00:49:57.093
Can't think of a guy
that would not want to...

751
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.431
What I meant,

752
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:03.370
was that it's nice to have somebody.

753
00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.185
Well,

754
00:50:08.023 --> 00:50:09.396
you got me pal.

755
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.018
How's it going?

756
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:27.663
I can't find a link.

757
00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:30.870
It's gonna be alright. You have...
No, it won't be!

758
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.006
The whole world's
counting on me and I...

759
00:50:33.211 --> 00:50:34.064
just...

760
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.728
Reed,

761
00:50:36.043 --> 00:50:37.510
you're gonna find the answer.

762
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.470
You always do.
Yeah, thanks Sue.

763
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.430
You just need to relax.
Yeah, right.

764
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:42.727
You do.
God.

765
00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.859
You need to relax.

766
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.305
Take a deep breath.

767
00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:49.859
Slower.

768
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:51.913
There you go.

769
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.560
Come on. Again.

770
00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:58.750
See?

771
00:50:59.392 --> 00:51:01.519
I can already feel
your pulse slowing down.

772
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.378
Do you remember that time...
A pulse.

773
00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:11.026
A tachyon pulse.

774
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:13.080
I love you.

775
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.666
Glad I can help.

776
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.150
So exactly how does this thing work?

777
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.478
When we activate the field,
it'll separate him from his board,

778
00:51:42.516 --> 00:51:43.648
making him powerless.

779
00:51:44.198 --> 00:51:45.489
Like a fish in a net.

780
00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:46.951
Yeah.
Yeah.

781
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.097
In theory, anyway.

782
00:51:49.099 --> 00:51:50.626
How long until before this it's operational?

783
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:53.204
Three hours.
Three hours?

784
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.000
I can only go so fast, since apparently
I'm working by myself now

785
00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.606
What do you need to make this happen?

786
00:51:58.608 --> 00:52:00.342
Actually there are a couple of things.

787
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.108
Do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing?

788
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:15.589
What are you doing?

789
00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.467
Don't you knock?

790
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:20.401
You're supposed to be
helping Reed in the lab.

791
00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.900
Tell him not to worry.

792
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:23.701
I'll be there to hold his hand and...

793
00:52:24.223 --> 00:52:25.983
finish his little project for him.

794
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.094
Anything else?

795
00:52:31.686 --> 00:52:32.903
How'd you do it?

796
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.742
How did you come back?

797
00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:41.810
It scares you doesn't it?

798
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.695
The things I can do.

799
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:50.435
Did you know I could create
a force field inside someone's body,

800
00:52:50.437 --> 00:52:52.300
and expand it until they explode?

801
00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:54.655
Give it your best shot.

802
00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.232
Just get back to the lab.

803
00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.204
Mr. Storm?

804
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.099
We're heading to intercept
the Surfer in 10 minutes,

805
00:53:13.249 --> 00:53:14.809
with or without you.

806
00:53:14.847 --> 00:53:15.511
Were you just...

807
00:53:16.033 --> 00:53:19.457
waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

808
00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:27.610
That was a joke.

809
00:53:27.783 --> 00:53:28.787
I was joking.

810
00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:31.071
Why are you so down on me?

811
00:53:31.468 --> 00:53:32.642
You don't even know me.

812
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:34.258
I know you very well.

813
00:53:34.722 --> 00:53:36.311
I read your personality profile.

814
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.385
Confident.

815
00:53:37.387 --> 00:53:39.191
Reckless. Irresponsible.

816
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:40.231
Self-obsessed,

817
00:53:40.233 --> 00:53:41.595
bordering on narcissism.

818
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:44.200
Ok, so you do know me.

819
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.722
All I've seen is a guy
that almost got his team killed.

820
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.800
Ok.

821
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.765
I've been a little off my game lately.

822
00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:55.641
This is not a game.

823
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.974
Sir, he's in position north of here.

824
00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:12.972
Good.

825
00:54:13.012 --> 00:54:14.808
General, give us a one-mile perimeter.

826
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:15.891
Forget it, Richards.

827
00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:17.653
You had your shot and you blew it.

828
00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:19.238
This is a military operation now.

829
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:20.539
So jam the signal,

830
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:22.771
get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

831
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.519
You don't understand.
No, you don't understand.

832
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.110
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks here.

833
00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.433
I'm the quarterback.

834
00:54:30.647 --> 00:54:32.005
You're on my team.

835
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:33.531
Got it?

836
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.078
But I guess you never
played football in high school.

837
00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:38.755
Did you, Richards?

838
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.667
No, you're right,

839
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:42.591
I didn't.

840
00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:45.316
I stayed in and studied,
like a good little nerd.

841
00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:48.917
And fifteen years later...

842
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:52.582
I'm one of the greatest minds
of the 21 st century.

843
00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:55.004
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

844
00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.710
And the big jock who played
quarterback in high school...

845
00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.612
he's standing right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

846
00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:05.201
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing...

847
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.454
unless he does exactly
what I tell him to and...

848
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:10.930
starts treating my friends and me,

849
00:55:11.299 --> 00:55:12.373
with some respect.

850
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.207
Give him what he wants.

851
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.090
I am so hot for you right now.

852
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:30.630
Me too.
Be careful, Johnny.

853
00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.755
Alright, let's go to work.

854
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:44.888
This is it.

855
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.261
You have your coordinates.

856
00:55:47.729 --> 00:55:50.427
Set up your posts and
rendezvous back here.

857
00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.816
First squad, move out!

858
00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:36.821
Hey.

859
00:56:37.139 --> 00:56:38.850
You scared me there, Smokey.

860
00:56:39.391 --> 00:56:41.351
Look at you. You're cute.

861
00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.027
Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo Boo.

862
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.429
Overgrown furball.

863
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.112
What's our status?

864
00:56:57.114 --> 00:56:58.726
<i>Yeah. I'm good to go.</i>

865
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.010
Same here.
Almost there.

866
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:13.742
Guys?

867
00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:15.968
We have a problem.

868
00:57:16.289 --> 00:57:17.151
<i>What's wrong?</i>

869
00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.279
He's here.

870
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.037
<i>Get out of there, right now!</i>

871
00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.512
Why are you destroying our planet?

872
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:50.172
I have no choice.

873
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:51.921
Sue!
Wait!

874
00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.531
What do you mean,
you don't have a choice?

875
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:59.917
There's always a choice.

876
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.941
Not always.

877
00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:06.788
Why are you trying to destroy us?

878
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.303
I am not the Destroyer.

879
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:14.040
Come on, Richards.
Jam the damn signal.

880
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:15.899
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

881
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:20.019
<i>Fire one over the top.</i>
Roger, out.

882
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:36.346
Open fire.
Open fire.

883
00:58:36.659 --> 00:58:37.932
Open fire! Repeat, open fire!

884
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:48.173
Fall back! Fall back!

885
00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.859
Let me just...
No, wait!

886
00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.000
Reed.

887
00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.760
Come on, Sue.

888
00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:02.154
Alright, it's up.

889
00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.061
Reed.

890
00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:05.755
Got him.

891
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:32.972
Not so tough now,

892
00:59:33.755 --> 00:59:34.819
are you?

893
00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:45.143
Victor! Stay back!

894
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.978
You're the quarterback.

895
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.132
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

896
01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.845
Perimeter secure!
Move him out.

897
01:00:16.902 --> 01:00:18.136
Open the gate!

898
01:00:18.138 --> 01:00:19.712
Get him to the debriefing room.

899
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.789
But general, we had an agreement.
Calm down.

900
01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.559
The enemy has been captured.
Mission accomplished.

901
01:00:37.226 --> 01:00:38.837
Where is he?
Contained.

902
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:40.493
General?

903
01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:43.726
Mr. Sherman.

904
01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.990
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

905
01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.513
I want to be there for the questioning.

906
01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:51.734
That's not gonna happen.

907
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.370
Please make sure our guests
remain here, comfortably.

908
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.038
Yes, sir.

909
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.247
General, what about the board?

910
01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.566
It's in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal.

911
01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.656
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do,

912
01:01:25.658 --> 01:01:28.146
because they're considered
human-rights violations.

913
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:31.497
Fortunately, you're not human.

914
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:39.517
Are we prisoners?

915
01:01:40.290 --> 01:01:41.827
How did that happen?

916
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.391
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

917
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.380
I can't imagine what they are doing
to him in there.

918
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:50.378
I say he gets what he deserves.

919
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.641
How can you say that?

920
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.295
I'm just saying that maybe
the general is right about this.

921
01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.928
The guy was about
to destroy the planet.

922
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.040
He said so himself.

923
01:01:58.042 --> 01:01:59.572
But it doesn't make any sense.

924
01:01:59.893 --> 01:02:01.628
He protected me from the missile.

925
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:02.794
Why would he do that?

926
01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.230
Maybe he thinks you're cute.

927
01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:05.914
There's a lot more going on here

928
01:02:06.314 --> 01:02:07.829
He said he wasn't the Destroyer.

929
01:02:08.385 --> 01:02:09.907
Maybe he lied?

930
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:15.470
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

931
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.830
But, under the radar.

932
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.075
Hey...

933
01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:26.511
is there any way
we can get some DVDs

934
01:02:26.674 --> 01:02:28.590
or popcorn or something,
just to pass the time?

935
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.380
I'll call it in, Mr. Storm.
Great.

936
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:32.230
Thank you. Semper fi.

937
01:02:32.384 --> 01:02:34.432
That's the Marine Corps.
We're the Army.

938
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.680
Right, I know it's the Army.

939
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.980
<i>Captain Raye. Access granted.</i>

940
01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:03.505
General.

941
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.789
Von Doom wants to speak with you.

942
01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:09.806
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

943
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:11.454
Mr. Sherman,

944
01:03:12.073 --> 01:03:13.096
let's take a break.

945
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:32.754
I know you are there.

946
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:46.741
What's your name?

947
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.154
Come on, you must have a name.

948
01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:53.390
I'm Susan.

949
01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.231
You said you weren't the
one trying to destroy our world.

950
01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:02.852
Then who is?

951
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.108
The one I serve.
Who do you serve?

952
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.688
Look I'm trying to help you,

953
01:04:10.883 --> 01:04:13.861
but in order to do that,
youhave to tell me the truth.

954
01:04:14.610 --> 01:04:15.544
Please.

955
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.670
It is known by many names.
My people called it...

956
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:32.945
Galactus...

957
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:35.773
the Devourer of Worlds.

958
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:42.100
It must feed on energy to survive.

959
01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.504
Both thermal...

960
01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:46.440
and organic.

961
01:04:46.459 --> 01:04:48.398
How can you willingly serve this thing?

962
01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:49.833
Because I must.

963
01:04:49.835 --> 01:04:51.111
Doesn't it bother you,

964
01:04:51.295 --> 01:04:54.781
all the worlds and innocent
people you've helped destroy?

965
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.813
My service spares my world...

966
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.577
and the one I love.

967
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:05.492
Why did you try to protect me?

968
01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.537
Because...

969
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.630
you remind me of her.

970
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.110
Could you stop the Destroyer
if you wanted to?

971
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.481
It is not I who draws the Destroyer here.

972
01:05:33.023 --> 01:05:34.358
It is the beacon.

973
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.667
What's the beacon?

974
01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.030
The source of my power.

975
01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:39.524
Your board?

976
01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:46.795
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left...

977
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.784
for he is nearly here.

978
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.031
Well?

979
01:06:08.421 --> 01:06:10.793
I helped deliver the alien to you,
as promised.

980
01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.272
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

981
01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.481
You can do your tests on the board...

982
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:19.915
but under armed guard,

983
01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:22.017
and in my presence only.

984
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:23.796
Absolutely.

985
01:06:31.353 --> 01:06:33.773
<i>General Hager. Access granted.</i>

986
01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:59.110
And the board draws it here.

987
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.240
How do you fight something
that eats planets?

988
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.468
We have to get to the board

989
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.121
and lead it away from
here before is too late.

990
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.305
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

991
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.880
He'll have no choice.

992
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:13.500
Thank you, general.

993
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:15.830
But I'm afraid...

994
01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.127
the truth is...

995
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:21.098
sometimes Reed is right.

996
01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:25.689
What?

997
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.740
Hey, you. Come here.

998
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:42.959
Let me ask you something.

999
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.760
Nice.

1000
01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:52.723
Crap.

1001
01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:00.811
Ben!

1002
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:07.490
Ok, that one hurt.

1003
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.870
Where's Reed?
Back here.

1004
01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.216
My bad.

1005
01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.273
Reed.

1006
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:37.995
Victor.

1007
01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.845
We've got to get it back.

1008
01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.367
We need to get the Surfer.

1009
01:09:41.369 --> 01:09:43.146
He's the only one that
understands its' power

1010
01:09:43.153 --> 01:09:44.942
Even if we break him out of this place,

1011
01:09:44.944 --> 01:09:46.707
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

1012
01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.350
Leave that to me.

1013
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.628
Halt! Don't move!

1014
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:21.741
Stay where you are!

1015
01:10:25.156 --> 01:10:26.031
Hey pal?

1016
01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:28.864
This is the luckiest day of your life.

1017
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:33.527
What the hell is going on?

1018
01:10:33.808 --> 01:10:35.491
Where is General Hager?

1019
01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.500
He's dead.

1020
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.540
And if we don't get him out of here,
we're all gonna be.

1021
01:10:39.682 --> 01:10:40.598
Frankie...

1022
01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:45.348
the world is literally at stake here.

1023
01:10:45.888 --> 01:10:47.135
You have to trust us.

1024
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:50.211
Please.

1025
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.246
We need to get to the roof.

1026
01:10:55.578 --> 01:10:56.791
It should be here by now.

1027
01:10:56.793 --> 01:10:58.013
What should be here?

1028
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.242
Holy crap!

1029
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:10.941
Reed.

1030
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:15.122
This is by far the coolest thing
you have ever done.

1031
01:11:24.633 --> 01:11:26.383
Hemi?
Of course.

1032
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:29.166
Ok, Ben, you get inside.

1033
01:11:29.307 --> 01:11:30.449
Johnny, you fly behind us.

1034
01:11:30.615 --> 01:11:31.881
Dude, you got to let me fly this thing.

1035
01:11:31.883 --> 01:11:34.053
Forget about it, I'm the best pilot here.
I should drive.

1036
01:11:34.055 --> 01:11:34.996
Are you serious?
Guys!

1037
01:11:34.998 --> 01:11:36.293
You're lucky if this thing can carry you!

1038
01:11:36.295 --> 01:11:38.475
I can fly circles around you blindfolded.
Guys!

1039
01:11:38.477 --> 01:11:39.880
Reed.
Shut up!

1040
01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.228
And move it!

1041
01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.254
I'm driving.

1042
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:47.584
Flame on!

1043
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:59.540
Ok. We're now officially enemies
of the United States of America.

1044
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.500
Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power.

1045
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:05.295
And we've got a giant
intergalactic force,

1046
01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:08.560
that's about to destroy our
planet in less than 24 hours.

1047
01:12:08.806 --> 01:12:10.129
Did I miss anything?

1048
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:13.076
I've got a lock Victor's energy trail.

1049
01:12:13.201 --> 01:12:14.862
He's headed over Southeast China.

1050
01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:15.815
Hang on.

1051
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.100
Norrin Radd.

1052
01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:24.687
What?

1053
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.100
I was once called, Norrin Radd.

1054
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.523
Norrin, we're gonna need your help
to save our world.

1055
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.484
Do you understand?

1056
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:40.953
What the hell was that?

1057
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:45.951
Victor, the board is
drawing the Destroyer here.

1058
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:47.484
You have to give it up.

1059
01:12:47.498 --> 01:12:49.858
You know, I've never
been the giving type, Reed.

1060
01:12:50.304 --> 01:12:51.284
Hold on!

1061
01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.270
We're sitting ducks!

1062
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:08.722
We're gonna have to split up!

1063
01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:11.002
What?
This ought to be fun!

1064
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:13.081
Stay close to me, Sue!

1065
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.552
He's really pissing me off!

1066
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.675
Surf's up, metalhead!

1067
01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:57.037
Victor, only the Surfer
can stop the Destroyer.

1068
01:13:57.237 --> 01:13:58.659
But he needs his board.

1069
01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:00.735
Come and get it, Richards.

1070
01:14:00.865 --> 01:14:01.770
Victor.

1071
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:08.750
Let's all go for a spin!

1072
01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.210
Norrin!

1073
01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:52.880
Catch.

1074
01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.850
Sue!

1075
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:14.883
Oh, my God.

1076
01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:16.860
Sue. Sue.

1077
01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:19.084
Oh, God.
Johnny, don't touch her!

1078
01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.120
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1079
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.029
You need to find a way
to get the board.

1080
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.200
Sue, l...
ok.

1081
01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:39.223
He is here.

1082
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.742
Reed?

1083
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:51.218
Reed.

1084
01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.575
Victor's got to have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

1085
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:57.678
We take it out,

1086
01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.151
we can separate him from his board.

1087
01:16:00.318 --> 01:16:01.358
He's too strong for me.

1088
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.990
I could whale on him,
if I could get close enough,

1089
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:06.348
but he could see me coming
from a mile away.

1090
01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.584
It would take all of us.

1091
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:12.905
Or maybe just one of us.

1092
01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.622
We don't know what it could do to you.

1093
01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.993
Let's not make this about me.

1094
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:46.747
To quote a friend of mine...

1095
01:16:47.592 --> 01:16:49.084
it's clobbering time.

1096
01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:47.958
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

1097
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:50.954
Not without me.

1098
01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:30.106
You've got to go.

1099
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:03.390
Treasure each moment with her.

1100
01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.065
And tell her she was right.

1101
01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.908
We do have a choice.

1102
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:38.720
Thought you could use a hand.

1103
01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:44.600
Oh, my God.

1104
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:15.732
Why isn't it working?

1105
01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.637
We were too late.

1106
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:30.006
I will no longer serve.

1107
01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:35.651
This is the end for us both.

1108
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:59.442
Hi.

1109
01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:03.012
Hi.

1110
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.151
What did I miss?

1111
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.524
Hey! Hey, hey!

1112
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.733
He did it.

1113
01:23:21.735 --> 01:23:23.011
Great job, kid.

1114
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.007
Hey, wait.

1115
01:23:26.984 --> 01:23:28.116
I'm not changing.

1116
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.953
Hey, that's right.

1117
01:23:30.810 --> 01:23:31.667
Great.

1118
01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:36.060
Ok, now you're making
me uncomfortable.

1119
01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:57.653
So I guess this is it.

1120
01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:00.920
We all go our separate ways.

1121
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:02.350
No.

1122
01:24:03.992 --> 01:24:05.362
No?
No.

1123
01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.354
No?

1124
01:24:06.443 --> 01:24:08.930
If not for the team the whole
world would be gone by now.

1125
01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.050
We can't run away
from our responsibilities

1126
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:12.277
and the people we need to protect.

1127
01:24:12.483 --> 01:24:13.728
This is who we are.

1128
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:14.815
That's what I've been saying.

1129
01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:16.901
What about having a normal life?

1130
01:24:16.908 --> 01:24:17.744
A family?

1131
01:24:17.746 --> 01:24:19.962
Who says you have to be
normal, to have a family?

1132
01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.359
So are you up for another
media-circus wedding?

1133
01:24:25.085 --> 01:24:26.540
Fifth time's a charm.

1134
01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:28.080
No.

1135
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.209
I got a better idea.

1136
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:45.551
Dearly beloved,

1137
01:24:45.882 --> 01:24:47.730
we are gathered here today,

1138
01:24:48.119 --> 01:24:49.455
to join Reed Richards,

1139
01:24:49.493 --> 01:24:52.224
and Sue Storm together in holy...

1140
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:53.645
matri...

1141
01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.455
What is it?

1142
01:24:56.741 --> 01:24:58.481
Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

1143
01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.650
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

1144
01:25:00.730 --> 01:25:02.517
Could we just skip to the end?

1145
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:04.045
Yeah...

1146
01:25:04.437 --> 01:25:06.967
The love these two share...
No, the very end.

1147
01:25:07.183 --> 01:25:08.278
Yeah great.

1148
01:25:09.019 --> 01:25:09.857
You have the rings?

1149
01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.333
Oh, yeah.

1150
01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:22.480
I now pronounce you man and wife,
and you may kiss the bride.

1151
01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:30.823
Ok.

1152
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:32.444
We should get out of here.
Yeah.

1153
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.162
Gotta go, hon.
Ok.

1154
01:25:39.363 --> 01:25:40.781
I have to throw the bouquet.

1155
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:42.465
Ready?

1156
01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:53.587
Heads up, Johnny.

1157
01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:05.694
Sorry.

1158
01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:08.561
Reflex.
