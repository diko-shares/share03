BEN: Okay, kids, I'm gonna
give you something special.

21
00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.853
It's called Thing dust.

22
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.481
-Okay, great!
-Unbelievable.

23
00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.691
Bizarre anomalies have been
occurring all over the world,

24
00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:56.527
-defying every known law of physics.
-Cool!

25
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.656
And all the media want to know about is
what china pattern Sue and I picked out.

26
00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.534
Hey, which one did you pick?
The blue ones with them little flowers?

27
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.454
-I really liked them.
-Excuse me. Would you mind--

28
00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.414
It's happening again, isn't it?

29
00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.667
-BEN: Yeah, sure, sure.
-No.

30
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.211
We're not postponing anything,
not this time.

31
00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.880
This is gonna be the wedding
you've always dreamed of.

32
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:17.840
And I'm not gonna let anything
get in the way of that.

33
00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:23.096
Not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level.

34
00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:26.474
That's the most romantic thing
you've ever said to me.

35
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:31.354
(chuckles) Which is really
pathetic when you think about it.

36
00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.982
Dr. Richards, I'm very sorry,
but it seems we're overbooked.

37
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.150
We do have some seats
available in coach though.

38
00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.277
Okay, here we go.

39
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.153
-Smile!
-Awesome!

40
00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:41.322
Look, Mom!

41
00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.324
-Let me get one more.
-That should be fine.

42
00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.747
Uh, that's my seat.

43
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:51.416
Sorry.

44
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.671
(grunting)

45
00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.515
Uh, excuse me.

46
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.112
What do you guys think about trying
to get an endorsement from an airline?

47
00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.948
-Get us a private jet.
-I think we have enough endorsement deals.

48
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.118
(laughing) That is funny.

49
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:31.205
No, but seriously. Reed, it could help you
subsidize all your little inventions.

50
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.541
-No, thanks.
-Excuse me.

51
00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:36.044
Consider it. I'll talk to you guys later.

52
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.088
-Johnny, where are you going?
-I don't fly coach.

53
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.649
I hope it rains.

Hey, honey.

68
00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.943
The city's trying to charge us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed.

69
00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:43.945
It was during that armored car robbery,

70
00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.364
but I only remember
two squad cars getting thrown.

71
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:48.324
Mm-hm.

72
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.326
Reed.

73
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.664
All right, all right, all right.
I'm putting it away.

74
00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.707
You were saying?

75
00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:59.877
I have a fitting in a half an hour,
the musicians after that,

76
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.214
and I haven't even picked out
place settings or the flowers.

77
00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.300
-There's just too much to do.
-Hey, don't worry about it.

78
00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.970
I'm sure, between the two of us,
we'll get it all done.

79
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.389
And what were you doing
when I just walked in?

80
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.182
I was inputting my to-do list.

81
00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.810
-Really?
-Scouts' honor.

82
00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.104
Hey, guys, new uniforms just showed up.

83
00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.107
-What do you think?
-Ugh.

84
00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.278
I think there's no way
we're wearing that, Johnny.

85
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:28.448
What do you have against capitalism?

86
00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:33.578
-What's this?
-Just a little hobby of mine.

87
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:38.541
Yeah? Would it make a good toy
or is it something, uh, science-y?

88
00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.377
-A little of both.
-Uh-uh.

89
00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.799
You know, I've always been
both impressed and disgusted at that.

90
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.135
Yeah, Sue says I'm addicted to it.

91
00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:51.137
I wonder why she'd say that.

92
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.930
Hey, Johnny.

93
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.267
Keep it quiet, but, uh,

94
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.146
I've cross-referenced and analyzed
the global disturbances.

95
00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.231
They're being caused by cosmic radiation,

96
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:04.317
not unlike the kind
which gave us our powers.

97
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.653
Wow, that's really boring.

98
00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:11.616
So, listen, I have a very important
wedding issue I need to talk to you about.

99
00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:13.659
Yeah, of course.

100
00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.119
Your bachelor party.

101
00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:18.706
(chuckles) No. Seriously, Johnny.

102
00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.917
-John.
-Huh?

103
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.794
Focus testing showed that
"Johnny" skewed a little young.

104
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.922
Seriously, Johnny, no bachelor party.

105
00:08:26.005 --> 00:08:28.966
It's just not my kind of thing.

106
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.426
Then do it for Ben.

107
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.179
It means a lot to the big guy.
You're gonna break his heart.

108
00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:35.765
He does have some sort
of rock-like heart, doesn't he?

109
00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.142
I've got too much to do
before the wedding.

110
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.729
Frankly, I think Sue might
have a problem with it.

111
00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.315
You know what I think Sue
would have a problem with?

112
00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:47.276
If somebody told her that
you were actually investigating

113
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.487
global disturbances
and cosmic radiation

114
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.700
instead of actually focusing
on the wedding, like you promised.

115
00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:08.130
-A bachelor party could be fun.
-Yes!

116
00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:12.176
-But no exotic dancers.
-(sighs)

117
00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.347
(loud whooshing)

118
00:09:24.438 --> 00:09:26.607
(loud whooshing)

119
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.669
-(distant siren wailing)
-(rap music playing)

120
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:52.216
-(rap music playing loudly)
-(people chattering)

121
00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:59.181
-This is it?
-I don't know anybody here.

122
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:02.268
Yeah, I would have invited some of your
friends, but you really don't have any.

123
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.270
Hey!

124
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.272
Johnny, we had a deal.

125
00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:09.191
They're not exotic dancers.

126
00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:12.236
They're just hot.

127
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.159
You're Mr. Fantastic, aren't you?

128
00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:21.579
That's so awesome. (giggles)

129
00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.790
Wow. You're really cute.

130
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:27.960
I'm gonna need a pitcher
with the biggest handle you've got.

131
00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:29.879
No problem.

132
00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.356
Good evening and welcome
to the Baxter, uh--

133
00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.734
C-Can I help you?

134
00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:53.527
No, you can't use that ele--

135
00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.328
Ms. Storm will be with you shortly.

136
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.459
Hello?
Thanks, Roberta.

137
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.798
-May I help you?
-We're here to see Dr. Richards.

138
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.841
I'm sorry.
He isn't here right now.

139
00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.968
-Is there anything I can help you with?
-Yes.

140
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.262
You can take me to see Dr. Richards.

141
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.099
Okay.

142
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:25.226
(pop music playing loudly)

143
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:27.186
(belching loudly)

144
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.232
Whoa!

145
00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:33.401
Sorry.

146
00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.027
(grunting) Right here.

147
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:37.321
When the universe began,
it was no bigger than a marble.

148
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:41.158
And then bam-- It exploded.

149
00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.619
And in a trillionth of a second,
it expanded exponentially

150
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.372
to what became the universe
we know today.

151
00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:49.208
Wow. You're really smart.

152
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:51.711
Well, thanks, Candy.
That means a lot to me.

153
00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.130
-(pop music playing)
-(cheering)

154
00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.340
-I love this song. You want to dance?
-No, I don't, really.

155
00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.676
-Yes, you do. Come on.
-No, no, honestly. No, no, no, no, please.

156
00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:01.762
-I don't want to embarrass you guys.
-(cheering)

157
00:12:11.939 --> 00:12:14.900
Just loosen up!
Have some fun!

158
00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:17.319
That's it.

159
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.447
Yeah. Whoo!

160
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:23.284
That's it.

161
00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:32.209
(crowd gasping)

162
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:35.463
-Guy really knows how to loosen up.
-You're not kidding.

163
00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:40.885
(screaming)

164
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.948
-There he is.
-Yes.

165
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.117
Unfortunately.

166
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:10.372
(laughing)

167
00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:12.500
For him.

168
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.796
Shall we?

169
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.637
Think it might be clobberin' time.

170
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.973
Sue. What are you--

171
00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:35.189
-General Hager.
-Let's talk somewhere private.

172
00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:38.901
Unless you need to do Jell-O shots
off someone's stomach.

173
00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:43.489
I was just explaining to the girls
about how the Big Bang led to--

174
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.491
This was Johnny's idea.

175
00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:48.327
I just went along.

176
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.623
How does Reed know the general?

177
00:13:52.706 --> 00:13:55.835
A few years back, the guy was trying
to push a new missile defense system.

178
00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:58.838
Reed testified that
the technology wouldn't work.

179
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.756
I'm only here, Richards,
because I'm under direct orders

180
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.007
from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

181
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:04.677
Personally, I don't like the idea
of sharing sensitive information

182
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.765
with a civilian scientist, especially one
who enjoys the public spotlight so much.

183
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:11.976
Always a pleasure
to see you too, General.

184
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.396
What can I do for you?

185
00:14:15.479 --> 00:14:18.774
As you may know, there have been recent
unusual occurrences all over the world.

186
00:14:18.858 --> 00:14:21.652
Officially, we've downplayed
their significance to the public,

187
00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:24.154
but we're concerned that these...

188
00:14:24.238 --> 00:14:27.908
anomalies might pose a credible threat
to our national security.

189
00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.786
These were taken by one
of our spy satellites three days ago.

190
00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:35.499
What is it?

191
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:37.877
We were hoping
Dr. Richards could tell us.

192
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.629
I'm afraid I've never
seen anything like it.

193
00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.298
Ben?

194
00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:47.887
Well, I would say that it was a meteor,
but the trail's all wrong.

195
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.763
This thing's giving off its own energy.

196
00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.724
Take a look at this.

197
00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:53.559
These have been appearing
in remote areas

198
00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:56.103
throughout the world
since the events started.

199
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:59.648
Field personnel estimate
its diameter to be 200 meters.

200
00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.109
HAGER: If we're gonna find out
what this is all about,

201
00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:05.362
we need a way to locate
and intercept that object.

202
00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.615
It'd be possible to build a sensor,

203
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:10.367
tie it into the Baxter Building
satellite grid.

204
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.703
And we can pinpoint
the exact location of the object.

205
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:15.581
Good, so then you'll build the sensor
for us, we'll tie that to the--

206
00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:16.999
I'm afraid I can't.

207
00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.376
What?

208
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.047
You see, I'm getting
married this Saturday.

209
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.965
I just don't have the time.

210
00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:30.679
Richards, your country
needs your help.

211
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.183
Look, why don't you call
Professor Jeff Wagner?

212
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:37.019
He's head of the physics department
at Brown. I'm sure he can help you.

213
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.146
I expected more, Richards.

214
00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.441
Even from you.

215
00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:47.404
(tires screeching)

216
00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:50.157
-(dance music playing)
-(people clamoring)

217
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.159
(cameras clicking)

218
00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:58.916
John Storm--
Fantastic Four, Incorporated.

219
00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.753
-You ever done any professional modeling?
-Not interested.

220
00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:05.172
-'Cause you got an amazing complexion.
-Not interested.

221
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.635
-Wow, and you...
-(car doors shutting)

222
00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:11.720
-...just walked away.
-(tires screeching)

223
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.098
I was definitely still talking.

224
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:16.934
I can't believe you just
turned down a science project.

225
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:21.438
They can build a sensor without me.

226
00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.733
The most important thing
right now is our wedding.

227
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.945
-No postponements, no interruptions.
-Thank you.

228
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:31.907
And, look, about what you saw
back at the bar--

229
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:34.868
Don't worry about it.
I know you.

230
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.330
I'm glad you had fun.

231
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.624
Thank you.

232
00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:47.172
Besides, it was nothing compared
to what I did at my bachelorette party.

233
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:50.426
(chuckles)
Talk about wild.

234
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.388
Wild?

235
00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:57.683
(grinder whirring)

236
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:05.399
Come on!

237
00:17:07.651 --> 00:17:09.445
(low grunt)

238
00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:14.825
(long, low exhale)

239
00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:17.745
-(booming whoosh)
-(yelling)

240
00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:25.127
(low grunting)

241
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.514
(low mechanical whirring)

242
00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.808
Hey, what are you doing up here?

243
00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:43.562
Nothing.
Just, uh, needed some air.

244
00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:46.231
You're making that thing
for the general, aren't you?

245
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.319
I'm guessing Susie doesn't
know anything about it.

246
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.738
Don't worry.
My lips are sealed.

247
00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.201
That is, they would be if I had any.
(chuckles)

248
00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:00.579
-Look, uh, don't tell Johnny.
-(flames whoosh)

249
00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:03.707
-Don't tell Johnny what?
-Great.

250
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:06.168
-Are you building that thing?
-No, it--

251
00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:09.421
(chuckles) If Sue finds out, you're
gonna get an invisible kick in the nuts.

252
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:12.424
-Hey, hey, hey. We're keeping this quiet.
-I know.

253
00:18:12.508 --> 00:18:13.884
BEN: Don't worry.

254
00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:16.762
<i>They're calling it</i>
<i>the wedding of the century.</i>

255
00:18:16.845 --> 00:18:18.972
<i>Reed Richards and Susan Storm,</i>

256
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.101
<i>also known as Mr. Fantastic</i>
<i>and the Invisible Woman,</i>

257
00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:24.436
<i>will try again to tie the knot today</i>

258
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.856
<i>in a private ceremony</i>
<i>in New York. Already--</i>

259
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.400
-(crowd clamoring)
-(siren chirps)

260
00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:36.907
-(crowd cheering, shouting)
-Johnny!

261
00:18:37.574 --> 00:18:40.285
-Look at these parasites.
-It's unbelievable.

262
00:18:40.369 --> 00:18:42.621
Have they no shame?

263
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.252
JOHNNY: Hey, hey.
Listen, listen, everybody.

264
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:50.546
This is a very special day for my sister.

265
00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.840
This is probably the most
important day of her life.

266
00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:56.176
So I just want to say to you guys,
please respect our privacy.

267
00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.970
-(reporters clamoring)
-Come on, Johnny!

268
00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:01.306
(chuckles) I'm just kidding.
We're gonna be auctioning off

269
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:03.433
the exclusive wedding photos
to the highest bidder.

270
00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:07.062
So go online and place your bids.
Thank you.

271
00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:08.564
Johnny! Are you--

272
00:19:08.647 --> 00:19:11.316
So what's it take
to date the Human Torch?

273
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.902
Fireproof lingerie and a lot of aloe.

274
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.863
(chuckles) Thank you.

275
00:19:23.745 --> 00:19:27.583
(lively chamber music playing)

276
00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.376
(chattering)

277
00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:30.794
I'm fine. How are you?

278
00:19:35.215 --> 00:19:37.092
Uh, invitation, sir.

279
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:39.219
(chuckles) Um, I should be on that list.

280
00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.305
-Name?
-Stan Lee.

281
00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:43.265
Yeah, uh, nice try,
buddy, nice try.

282
00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.517
No, no, really. I-I-I'm Stan Lee.

283
00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:51.106
This isn't how I imagined it.

284
00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:55.569
-It never is.
-No, Alicia.

285
00:19:55.652 --> 00:19:58.363
It just doesn't feel right.

286
00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:01.283
Sweetie...

287
00:20:03.202 --> 00:20:06.538
I think even superheroes are allowed
to have wedding day jitters.

288
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.832
It's more than that.

289
00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:11.418
Is my life always gonna be a circus?

290
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.922
Do we really want to
raise kids in all this?

291
00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:17.966
Face it, we're not exactly normal.

292
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.219
(chuckles)
Ben and I aren't normal,

293
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:24.598
but we don't let it get
in the way of us being happy.

294
00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.768
Do you love Reed?

295
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.313
More than I've ever loved anyone.

296
00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.900
Then you have nothing to worry about.

297
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.447
-Thank you.
-(laughs)

298
00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:49.915
(sniffles) Okay.

299
00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:51.667
(Alicia laughs)

300
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.794
-Oh, great.
-What?

301
00:20:53.877 --> 00:20:56.505
-I've got a zit.
-Can't you put makeup on it?

302
00:20:56.588 --> 00:21:00.592
No, no, I got it. Crisis averted.

303
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.719
Now all I have to do is concentrate

304
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:05.097
on that area continuously
for the next eight hours.

305
00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.475
(clinking)

306
00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.896
Reed, come on--
You're gonna miss your own wedding.

307
00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.358
Just a minute.
Almost done.

308
00:21:20.737 --> 00:21:23.240
General, I'm putting
the sensor on line...

309
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.034
-(beeping)
-...now.

310
00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:30.664
(deep electronic groan)

311
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:34.584
There. If there's a surge in cosmic
radiation anywhere on the planet,

312
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.586
-you'll know about it.
<i>-Let's hope so, Richards.</i>

313
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.672
<i>We've already gotten reports</i>
<i>of two more craters.</i>

314
00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:40.549
<i>♪ Here comes the bride ♪</i>

315
00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:43.218
All right, all right, all right.
Just linking it to my PDA.

316
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.596
-(grumbles quietly)
-And, uh, that's it.

317
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.474
Good. That's great.
Now, would you shave and put on your tux?

318
00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:52.436
You're getting married in an hour,
and you look like a bum.

319
00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.187
Absolutely.

320
00:21:55.772 --> 00:21:57.065
What?

321
00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:02.362
(soft chuckle)
I'm getting married.

322
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:04.072
(laughs)

323
00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.327
-Oh!
-Oh, geez!

324
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.580
I'm getting married.

325
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:15.959
I heard of getting cold feet--

326
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.051
Okay.

327
00:22:24.134 --> 00:22:26.470
-Hey, Johnny.
-(exhales) Wow!

328
00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:29.139
(laughs) Does that
amaze anyone else?

329
00:22:29.222 --> 00:22:31.641
How did she know it was me?
I didn't say anything!

330
00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.769
Well, to be honest,
you kind of smell like ash.

331
00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:37.981
-(chuckles) You're late.
-Oh, let's not make today about me.

332
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.524
It's Reed and Sue's big day.

333
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:41.318
Let's give them
the attention for a change.

334
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.487
-Ow!
-Oh! Don't do that.

335
00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.905
(chuckles)

336
00:22:44.988 --> 00:22:47.574
-Okay, you're perfect.
-You're perfect.

337
00:22:52.204 --> 00:22:54.039
I'll see you upstairs.

338
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.417
Bye, Johnny.

339
00:22:57.501 --> 00:22:58.668
(sighs)

340
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:01.546
So, it seems like you
and Alicia are doing well.

341
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.258
-Annoyingly so, in fact.
-Yeah. I'm a lucky guy.

342
00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:07.302
Yeah, you are.

343
00:23:07.386 --> 00:23:10.138
Question for you though.

344
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.932
How do you guys, um--

345
00:23:13.016 --> 00:23:15.143
(snaps fingers)

346
00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.561
That's none of your business!

347
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:18.980
Okay, all right.
I'm just concerned.

348
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.691
I'd hate to wake up one morning and
find out she was killed in a rock slide.

349
00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:24.027
I'll show you a rock slide!

350
00:23:24.111 --> 00:23:27.948

351
00:23:28.031 --> 00:23:30.659

352
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:33.286
(beeping)

353
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.081
<i>(overlapping, indistinct voices continue)</i>

354
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:43.380
(long, quiet exhale)

355
00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:46.216
(deep, breathy voice)
What are you?

356
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:56.226
Oh. Thank you.

357
00:23:56.309 --> 00:23:59.104
You're welcome.

358
00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:01.857
Johnny. (chuckles)

359
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.194
-You shouldn't tease him so much.
-It was a joke.

360
00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:10.073
I don't know. I think it bothers you
to see him really happy and in love.

361
00:24:10.157 --> 00:24:12.117
I think you're jealous.

362
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.119
-You think I'm jealous?
-Mm-hm.

363
00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:15.829
Have you seen
the women I've dated?

364
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.791
No. (laughs)

365
00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.628
You can only fool yourself
but for so long, Torch.

366
00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:26.298
Ta-da!

367
00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:29.426
-Hey! It's the bride of stretchy man.
-Don't start.

368
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:31.511
Eh, don't listen to him.
You look gorgeous.

369
00:24:31.595 --> 00:24:33.472
-Thanks.
-I'll see you out there, sweetie.

370
00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:35.140
-Come on.
-Okay.

371
00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:37.100
-We're on.
-Okay. Okay.

372
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.523
You know, you don't look
completely ridiculous in that dress.

373
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:47.611
Is that obnoxious brother talk
for "You look kind of nice"?

374
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.363
You look beautiful.

375
00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:55.202
Thank you.

376
00:24:58.038 --> 00:25:00.248
(chuckles)

377
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:06.338
(sighs)

378
00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:11.801
Dad would be proud.

379
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.348
(quietly) Yeah.

380
00:25:19.643 --> 00:25:22.521

-Actually this is a--

388
00:26:07.983 --> 00:26:09.985
(sniffling)

389
00:26:25.792 --> 00:26:29.296
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today to--

390

(helicopter whirring)

391
00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:34.718
MAN (over loudspeaker): Sue and Reed,
congratulations on your wedding!

392
00:26:34.801 --> 00:26:36.636
(laughs softly)

393
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.389
Where was I?
Uh-- Oh, yeah.

394
00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:41.725
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

395
00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:44.728
to join this couple,
Reed Richards and Susan Storm...

396
00:26:44.811 --> 00:26:47.063
-(blows nose loudly)
-(beeping)

397
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:52.777
-(beeping)
-...in the bond of holy

398
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:57.032
matri... mony.

399
00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.451
I can't believe you actually
brought that thing to our wedding!

400
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:03.163
I know, but there's a good reason.
We have to get through this quickly.

401
00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:06.625
-Oh, that's romantic.
-Should I continue?

402
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.501
Yes, please.

403
00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:10.629
There are many kinds of love--

404
00:27:10.712 --> 00:27:14.215
-Could you skip to the end, please?
-Reed!

405
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.135
-Excuse me?
-(PDA beeping)

406
00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:26.311
-(jackhammer stops)
-What happened?

407
00:27:26.394 --> 00:27:28.271
(chattering)

408
00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:36.321
(beeping)

409
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:42.535
We've lost power!
We're going down! We're going down!

410
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.121
It's too late.

411
00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:48.458
(people gasping)

412
00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:55.090
-Pull up! Pull up!
-I'm trying! I'm trying!

413
00:27:56.883 --> 00:27:58.802
(yelling, shouting)

414
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:14.317
Ben!

415
00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.280
-(tail rotor clattering)
-(Ben grunting)

416
00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:25.120
(excited chatter)

417
00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.833
-Johnny.
-This is Dolce.

418
00:28:30.834 --> 00:28:32.377
(groans)

419
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:35.088
Flame on!

420
00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.509
(exhales)

421
00:28:39.592 --> 00:28:41.302
(crying)

422
00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.179
(quiet chatter)

423
00:28:51.271 --> 00:28:53.022
Man, he's fast.

424
00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:57.902
Huh? (yells)

425
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.116
(reverberating rumble)

426
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.911
Aw, that is cool.

427
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:09.205
-(whooshing)
-Whoa!

428
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.048
Yo, taxi!

429
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:30.185
-Whoa!
-(horn honking)

430
00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:32.020
(grunts)

431
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:37.692
Show-off.

432
00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:43.782
-(people gasp)
-(horn honks)

433
00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:46.451
(Johnny grunting)

434
00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:09.474
Time to end this.

435
00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.812
(yells)

436
00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.480
(choked, high-pitched) Can we talk?

437
00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:17.982
(choking, gasping)

438
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.284
Okay. You win.

439
00:30:36.042 --> 00:30:38.628
(grunts) Flame on!

440
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:40.964
Come on! Flame on!

441
00:30:42.215 --> 00:30:44.592
Whoa!
(grunts)

442
00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:46.302
(grunting)

443
00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:49.138
(men shouting
in foreign language)

444
00:30:51.015 --> 00:30:52.892
(coughing)

445
00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:54.978
(Johnny exhales)

446
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:57.063
(grunts)

447
00:30:57.146 --> 00:30:59.941
(exhausted panting)

448
00:31:00.024 --> 00:31:03.653
(braying, grunting)

449
00:31:04.737 --> 00:31:06.406
Hey.

450
00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:18.251
(deep, distorted hum)

451
00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:21.087
Your herald summons you.

452
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.631
Another world awaits.

453
00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.010
Let it be done quickly.

454
00:31:27.093 --> 00:31:29.512
(whooshing)

455
00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:34.976
It looked like a man,
but completely covered in silver,

456
00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:38.605
and it was flying this, like--
like, a surfboard type thing.

457
00:31:38.688 --> 00:31:42.275
-I know that sounds crazy.
-Oh, no, not at all.

458
00:31:42.358 --> 00:31:46.362
So, did you follow the shiny man
to Lollipop Land or to Rainbow Junction?

459
00:31:46.446 --> 00:31:49.991
-Look, I know what I saw.
-Thank you. It's all right, Johnny.

460
00:31:50.074 --> 00:31:52.869
Whatever this thing's
physical appearance is,

461
00:31:52.952 --> 00:31:54.746
it has the ability to convert matter
and energy.

462
00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:56.372
So it caused the anomalies.

463
00:31:57.415 --> 00:32:01.669
It seems to radiate cosmic energy when it
exerts itself, randomly affecting matter.

464
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.589
Evidently this entity, this...

465
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.509
...Silver Surfer...

466
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:11.220
didn't want to be detected.

467
00:32:11.304 --> 00:32:14.349
-It destroyed the sensor.
-It knew it was being monitored?

468
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:16.017
And traced it back here.

469
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.227
We're dealing with something
highly resourceful.

470
00:32:19.228 --> 00:32:20.438
(groans)

471
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:23.358
-(exhales)
-Are you feeling okay?

472
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.527
Yeah. I just--
I got to walk this off.

473
00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:33.701
We have to destroy this thing
before it attacks again.

474
00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.578
Richards, find me another way to track it.

475
00:32:35.662 --> 00:32:37.121
(elevator bell dings)

476
00:32:37.664 --> 00:32:39.666
(exhales)

477
00:32:42.961 --> 00:32:44.837
Sue, I am so sorry.

478
00:32:45.338 --> 00:32:48.299
The only reason I didn't tell you about it
is because I didn't want you to worry.

479
00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:51.344
I'm not mad that you built the sensor.
It was the right thing to do.

480
00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:52.887
Oh, great.

481
00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:57.767
-(whoosh)
-I wasn't finished.

482
00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:03.439
(distorted) Okay, sorry.
Please continue.

483
00:33:03.523 --> 00:33:06.567
See, this proves exactly what
I've been saying all along.

484
00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:09.946
-Could you drop the force field, please?
-We can't even-- Oh, sorry.

485
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:13.408
We can't even have a wedding
without it turning into World War III.

486
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:17.662
I know. But once we are married,
everything will be back to normal.

487
00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:21.749
We will never have normal lives
as long as we do what we do.

488
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:24.293
How could we possibly
raise a family like this?

489
00:33:27.797 --> 00:33:31.467
I'm going to--
I'm going to go check on Johnny.

490
00:33:39.142 --> 00:33:41.102
(exhales)

491
00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:43.938
(distant siren wails)

492
00:33:44.022 --> 00:33:45.273
Johnny?

493
00:33:46.774 --> 00:33:49.569
-(whooshing)
-Whoa!

494
00:33:49.652 --> 00:33:51.946
(loud grunt)

495
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.324
-(car alarm blaring)
-Hey, are you all right, pal?

496
00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:57.744
-(Johnny groaning)
-Is he all right?

497
00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:04.709
Johnny?
Johnny, are you okay?

498
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:07.336
(weakly) I don't know.

499
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.423
I feel really strange since
my run-in with surfer boy.

500
00:34:10.506 --> 00:34:13.885
-Maybe we should get you checked out.
-(Johnny grunts)

501
00:34:13.968 --> 00:34:16.012
-Why'd you do that?
-I didn't do anything!

502
00:34:16.095 --> 00:34:17.388
Stop, drop and roll!

503
00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:18.890
-Stop, drop and roll!
-(screaming)

504
00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:22.643
-Oh, my God! Sue!
-(continues screaming)

505
00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:25.313
Just hang on.
I'll get you, okay?

506
00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:27.815
Flame on!

507
00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.276
-(woman yells)
-JOHNNY: Hey, watch it.

508
00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:32.528
-(man grunts)
-Whoa!

509
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:36.157
(muffled screaming)

510
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.452
SUE: Reed! Reed! Help!

511
00:34:40.286 --> 00:34:42.747
-Sue?
-I'm on fire! Reed!

512
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.084
-Sue! What's going on?
-I'm on fire!

513
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:48.252
-You're on fire!
-Ya think?

514
00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:50.963
-Hold on.
-Pull me in! (screams)

515
00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:54.258
Help! (screaming)

516
00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:57.261
-Hey, it's the Human Torch!
-Johnny!

517
00:34:57.345 --> 00:34:59.806
-I'm not Johnny!
-Sue, how did this happen?

518
00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:02.767
I touched Johnny, and then this!

519
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.353
-Well, where is Johnny?
-JOHNNY: Here.

520
00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:08.231
-Try it again.
-Get me down!

521
00:35:09.315 --> 00:35:10.608
(gasping)

522
00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:14.904
-(wolf whistle)
-Nice!

523
00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:17.615
Hey, get out of there.
Sue, your clothes.

524
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.829
(gasps) Why does this
always happen to<i> me?</i>

525
00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:25.540
<i>REED: All of Sue's results are normal.</i>

526
00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:28.876
-But Johnny's--
-Johnny's are what?

527
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.964
Your encounter with the Surfer
has affected your molecules.

528
00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:34.674
They're in a constant state of flux.

529
00:35:36.342 --> 00:35:39.053
(inhales) Is that bad?

530
00:35:40.138 --> 00:35:42.765
Well, it caused you to temporarily
switch powers with Sue.

531
00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.309
-Ideally, I'd like to run some more tests.
-Would you like a volunteer?

532
00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.103
-No, no, no!
-No, no, no!

533
00:35:47.186 --> 00:35:49.689
No, no! Hey!
This is serious.

534
00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:51.649
I just wanted to give him a hug.

535
00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:54.110
We don't know the extent
of his condition yet.

536
00:35:54.193 --> 00:35:55.903
It could be progressive,
it could be degenerative.

537
00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.030
-It could be fun.
-No, Ben!

538
00:35:58.114 --> 00:36:00.908
-Ben!
-Whoa! Hey!

539
00:36:00.992 --> 00:36:03.828
Hey, it's me. I'm back!

540
00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:14.672
Oh, my God!

541
00:36:15.673 --> 00:36:18.176
Come on! We just said this is serious!

542
00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:22.180
Oh, yeah, serious. (laughing)

543
00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:26.517
-Oh, you got to be kidding me!
-(laughing)

544
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:29.437
-Hey, not bad.
-Incredible.

545
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.231
-Reed, you better be able to fix this.
-I'm right on it.

546
00:36:32.315 --> 00:36:35.276
-Trust--
-Ben, stop it!

547
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.528
I'm starting to see
why you like that. Ha!

548
00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:39.447
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

549
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.532
(both grunt)

550
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.367
Aw, crap!

551
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:44.869
That's not funny.

552
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:46.704
What am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

553
00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:49.665
Just, uh, try to keep
your distance from us.

554
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:55.421
You and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together, pal.

555
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:57.673
(chuckles)

556
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.018
<i>My inside sources are telling me</i>
<i>that the unlucky bride-to-be, Sue Storm,</i>

557
00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:11.979
<i>turned invisible, and it seems</i>
<i>she's staying that way</i>

558
00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.941
<i>after yesterday's</i>
<i>embarrassing fiasco.</i>

559
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:18.861
<i>Coming up next, the Invisible Woman's</i>
<i>greatest fashion blunders</i>

560
00:37:18.945 --> 00:37:22.782
<i>and an impromptu dance routine</i>
<i>from former scientist Reed Richards.</i>

561
00:37:22.865 --> 00:37:27.536
Sue, why do you keep watching this?
Just ignore it.

562
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.831
I can't ignore it, Reed.
There's no getting away from it.

563
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:33.167
-I believe there is.
-How?

564
00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:34.961
(sighs)

565
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:37.463
See? No answer.

566
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.969
Yes, there is.

567
00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:46.138
What if, after this crisis is over...

568
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.891
...we leave it all behind?

569
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:50.893
SUE: What are you talking about?

570
00:37:50.977 --> 00:37:53.354
We move out
of the Baxter Building.

571
00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:58.484
I'll take a teaching position somewhere,
get back to my research,

572
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:02.363
and the two of us will live our lives
and raise a family like normal people.

573
00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.198
You would do that?

574
00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:08.119
Nothing's more important to me
than our future together.

575
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:11.872
Oh, thank you.

576
00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:15.960
(laughs)

577
00:38:17.753 --> 00:38:19.130
What about Ben and Johnny?

578
00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:21.549
Well, they'll understand.

579
00:38:22.425 --> 00:38:25.636
Besides, Johnny's always
been more of a solo act.

580
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.763
SUE: Let's not mention it to them yet.

581
00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:30.641
Johnny's got enough
to worry about as it is,

582
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:32.601
with his power problems.

583
00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:33.704
You've been busy, my friend.

584
00:39:33.788 --> 00:39:36.415
Your talents are impressive.

585
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.587
Can you understand what I'm saying?

586
00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:47.468
Together, we could be unstoppable.

587
00:39:48.469 --> 00:39:51.555
Anything would be ours for the taking.

588
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.059
All that you know is at an end.

589
00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:57.103
What do you mean by that?

590
00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:01.232
Wait! I said wait!

591
00:40:05.444 --> 00:40:07.279
(deep whooshing)

592
00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:11.659
(grunts, groans)

593
00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:14.203
(groaning, mumbling)

594
00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:23.212
(chuckles)

595
00:40:25.464 --> 00:40:28.092
-They're breaking up the team.
-Huh?

596
00:40:28.175 --> 00:40:29.969
Reed and Sue--
I just overheard them.

597
00:40:30.052 --> 00:40:33.222
They want a nice, normal, boring-ass life.
No more Fantastic Four.

598
00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:36.976
Well, what do they expect us to do,
keep it going, just the two of us?

599
00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:40.146
And call ourselves what,
the Dynamic Duo?

600
00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:41.772
When were they gonna tell us?

601
00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:45.359
They'll tell you when
they're ready to tell you.

602
00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:47.361
It's their decision, not yours.

603
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.656
You can't be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy.

604
00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:51.907
(door opens)

605
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:56.328
Guys, we've got a serious problem.

606
00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:58.539
I've been cross-referencing
the Surfer's radiation

607
00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:01.000
through every
astronomical database.

608
00:41:01.083 --> 00:41:04.670
Altair 7, Rigel 3, Vega 6.

609
00:41:04.753 --> 00:41:06.630
He's been to all these planets?

610
00:41:06.714 --> 00:41:10.342
And now they're lifeless, barren,
some even shattered.

611
00:41:10.426 --> 00:41:14.472
Everywhere the Surfer goes,
eight days later, the planet dies.

612
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:19.560
And how are we gonna stop him?

613
00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.604
We don't even know where he is.

614
00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:26.025
What about the craters?

615
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.949
REED: They're appearing
in a numerical sequence.

616
00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.868
The last crater
was formed in Greenland,

617
00:41:35.951 --> 00:41:39.163
so the next in the
sequence should be...

618
00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:43.042
latitude: 51 degrees,
30 minutes north;

619
00:41:43.125 --> 00:41:47.671
longitude: zero degrees,
seven minutes west.

620
00:42:00.142 --> 00:42:03.437
When he surfaces, you've got
to move the fight away from the crowd.

621
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:06.649
No, he's too fast to be contained.
When I see silver, I'm hitting him.

622
00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:08.025
REED: Wait, you can't do that.

623
00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:09.902
We've got to stick to the
plan and work as a team.

624
00:42:09.985 --> 00:42:12.154
Oh, so we're a team now?
That's news to me.

625
00:42:12.238 --> 00:42:14.615
-What are you talking about?
-You know what I'm talking about.

626
00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:17.034
-Look, we were gonna tell you guys--
-When were you gonna tell us,

627
00:42:17.117 --> 00:42:18.994
when you moved our stuff
out of the Baxter Building?

628
00:42:19.078 --> 00:42:20.829
Johnny, this really isn't a good time.

629
00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:22.957
Kid's got a point, Reed.
You should've told us.

630
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.417
All right, all right! That's enough!
We'll talk about this later.

631
00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:27.378
What the hell is wrong with you people?

632
00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.173
(excited chatter)

633
00:42:34.343 --> 00:42:36.554
WOMAN: Look!
There's a whirlpool!

634
00:42:36.637 --> 00:42:38.138
Oh, my God!

635
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.146
-(excited chatter, gasping)
-What is that?

636
00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:54.196
(wires snapping)

637
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.447
(screaming)

638
00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:01.829
(rumbling)

639
00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:03.622
-(deep creaking)
-(wire snaps)

640
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:05.249
Get out! Get out!

641
00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:07.918
(deep creaking)

642
00:43:10.045 --> 00:43:11.672
(creaking)

643
00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:17.678
(straining)

644
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.601
(creaking)

645
00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:25.102
(strained grunt)

646
00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:27.646
-Don't let go!
-(grunting)

647
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.200
-Move!
-Come on! Go!

648
00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:43.162
(rumbling, booming)

649
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.334
(people gasping)

650
00:43:57.092 --> 00:43:58.510
No, Johnny!

651
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:07.936
-(screaming)
-Daddy!

652
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.272
(grunts, groans)

653
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.274
(gasps)

654
00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:16.528
(panicked shouts)

655
00:44:16.612 --> 00:44:19.031
-(gasps)
-Guys?

656
00:44:19.114 --> 00:44:22.117
What are you doing?

657
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.501
Ben! Lift it higher!

658
00:44:30.584 --> 00:44:32.336
(grunting) I'll try.

659
00:44:34.129 --> 00:44:37.257
(strained grunting)

660
00:44:38.967 --> 00:44:40.678
(grunts)

661
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.395
(weak groan)

662
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.357
-Oh!
-Oh!

663
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.109
(panting)

664
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.279
(panting)

665
00:45:00.572 --> 00:45:02.741
(indistinct chatter)

666
00:45:03.659 --> 00:45:05.577
Sue!

667
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:11.458
-(Sue groans)
-Whoa! Hey!

668
00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:14.628
Stay back before you get somebody killed.

669
00:45:17.339 --> 00:45:19.299
Oh, my God.

670
00:45:39.653 --> 00:45:41.280
What the hell was that?

671
00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:44.742
We'll make adjustments.
Next time we'll be ready.

672
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:47.619
Next time--
There's no next time.

673
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:51.957
You can't handle this alone.
That's why I'm bringing in some help.

674
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.251
General, you bring in more
soldiers and weaponry,

675
00:45:54.334 --> 00:45:56.086
you're gonna put
innocent people in danger.

676
00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.963
MAN: No more than you already have.

677
00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:04.803
Victor.

678
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:08.682
(laughs) What's the matter?
Afraid of ghosts?

679
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:10.017
(fierce roar)

680
00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.436
-Look out!
-Don't move!

681
00:46:12.519 --> 00:46:16.190
Since you're a ghost, you won't mind
if I break your little neck.

682
00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:18.233
-Let him go.
-Don't you know who that is?

683
00:46:18.317 --> 00:46:19.943
He's Victor Von Doom.
He's here under my orders.

684
00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.572
(gasping, grunting)

685
00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:29.036
Ben, let him go.

686
00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:31.955
(gagging, coughing)

687
00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:33.999
How is this possible?

688
00:46:34.082 --> 00:46:36.543
(coughing)

689
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.253
How are you still alive?

690
00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:42.007
No thanks to you four,
that's for certain.

691
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.844
Von Doom's made contact with the alien.
He's got valuable information.

692
00:46:45.928 --> 00:46:49.389
Information that might
just help save the planet.

693
00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:52.935
Now, let's be clear about this, shall we?

694
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:54.853
I hate you.

695
00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:58.190
All of you.

696
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.360
But the world's at stake,

697
00:47:01.443 --> 00:47:04.696
and we need to work
together to survive.

698
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.949
General, we know firsthand--

699
00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:09.326
you trust Victor,
and you're gonna regret it.

700
00:47:09.409 --> 00:47:13.622
So far the only one I've regretted
trusting here is you, Richards.

701
00:47:15.749 --> 00:47:17.376
Reed, don't agree to this.

702
00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:25.133
Let's see what he's got.

703
00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:28.887
VICTOR: I made a detailed
recording of our little encounter.

704
00:47:28.971 --> 00:47:32.599
<i>SILVER SURFER:</i>
<i>All that you know is at an end.</i>

705
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:36.645
Well?

706
00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:40.190
I like the part where he
knocks you on your ass.

707
00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:46.071
Look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me.

708
00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:50.617
There. You see
what happened?

709
00:47:53.328 --> 00:47:55.455
REED: The energy was
channeled through him,

710
00:47:55.539 --> 00:47:57.165
but it originated from his board.

711
00:47:57.249 --> 00:48:02.170
If we can separate him from the board,
we can cut off his power completely.

712
00:48:02.254 --> 00:48:04.965
-And that's what we have to do.
-How?

713
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:07.134
If I knew that, I wouldn't need
you people, would I?

714
00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:11.763
You two should get started right away.

715
00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:21.565
I'm glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again.

716
00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:26.320
I'll try to talk slowly
so you can keep up.

717
00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:27.738
(pats shoulder)

718
00:48:32.701 --> 00:48:35.537
How can we be working
on the same side as Victor?

719
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:39.958
You got me, pal. Things were a lot simpler
when I could just whale on the guy.

720
00:48:40.959 --> 00:48:43.253
-Oh!
-(excited chatter)

721
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.423
(chatter quiets down)

722
00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:51.428
-I'll pay for that.
-MAN: You better.

723
00:48:51.511 --> 00:48:54.973
I got to tell you, Ben, I'm starting
to feel like a complete screw-up.

724
00:48:55.057 --> 00:48:57.935
Hey, hey, you're not
a<i> complete </i>screw-up.

725
00:48:58.018 --> 00:49:02.147
-Thank you.
-Look, kid, it's out of our hands.

726
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.567
-It's up to the eggheads now.
-You think Reed's right?

727
00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:07.736
About the whole
end-of-the-world thing?

728
00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:11.573
He's never been wrong about
this kind of thing before.

729
00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:14.785
Well, I'm not exactly a deep kind of guy.

730
00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:16.620
Really.

731
00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.958
But if Reed's right and this is it...

732
00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:26.171
...how do you want to spend
your last few minutes?

733
00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:29.466
Part of me would like to go out fighting.

734
00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:34.763
(chuckles) But the truth is,

735
00:49:34.846 --> 00:49:38.183
I'd like to spend my last couple
of minutes holding Alicia.

736
00:49:40.435 --> 00:49:42.396
That sounds pretty good.

737
00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.564
I mean, not
the holding-Alicia thing--

738
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:47.109
That's, you know,
your girlfriend, not mine.

739
00:49:47.192 --> 00:49:49.611
I want nothing to do with her.
Not to say that she's not attractive.

740
00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:52.990
She's very attractive.
I mean, she's, you know, so attractive.

741
00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:54.908
Even with the, you know--

742
00:49:54.992 --> 00:49:57.327
I can't even think of a guy
that wouldn't want to--

743
00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:00.497
What I meant...

744
00:50:01.456 --> 00:50:03.834
...was that it's just nice
to have somebody.

745
00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:10.090
-Well, you got me, pal.
-Ah.

746
00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:15.095
-(typing)
-(beeping)

747
00:50:24.688 --> 00:50:28.150
-How's it going?
-I can't find the link.

748
00:50:28.233 --> 00:50:30.861
-It's gonna be all right. You have--
-No, it won't be!

749
00:50:30.944 --> 00:50:33.822
The whole world's counting on me,
and I just--

750
00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:38.785
Reed, you're gonna find the answer.
You always do.

751
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.495
-Yeah, thanks, Sue.
-You just need to relax.

752
00:50:40.579 --> 00:50:42.581
-Yeah, right.
-You do.

753
00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:45.250
-(loud thud)
-Reed, you need to relax.

754
00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:48.503
-Take a deep breath.
-(exhales)

755
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.505
-Slower.
-(exhales)

756
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:52.215
There you go.

757
00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.343
Come on. Again.

758
00:50:57.679 --> 00:51:01.683
See? I can already
feel your pulse slowing down.

759
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:05.270
Mmm. Do you remember
that time in school--

760
00:51:05.353 --> 00:51:08.774
-A pulse.
-Huh?

761
00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:13.153
A tachyon pulse. Oh, I love you.

762
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.031
Glad I could help.

763
00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:21.036
(beeps)

764
00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:38.637
<i>HAGER: So exactly how</i>
<i>does this thing work?</i>

765
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.722
<i>REED: When we</i>
<i>activate the field,</i>

766
00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:43.558
<i>it'll separate him from his board,</i>
<i>making him powerless.</i>

767
00:51:43.642 --> 00:51:45.519
It's like a fish in a net.

768
00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:47.354
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

769
00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:50.524
-In theory, anyway.
-How long before this is operational?

770
00:51:50.607 --> 00:51:53.735
-Three hours.
-Three hours.

771
00:51:53.819 --> 00:51:56.738
I know, I can only go so fast, since
apparently I'm working by myself now.

772
00:51:56.822 --> 00:51:58.657
What do you need
to make this happen?

773
00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:00.659
Actually, there are a couple of things.

774
00:52:00.742 --> 00:52:02.410
(continues talking indistinctly)

775
00:52:06.873 --> 00:52:08.875
(beeping)

776
00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:15.841
What are you doing?

777
00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:18.343
Don't you knock?

778
00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:20.720
You're supposed to be
helping Reed in the lab.

779
00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:23.515
Tell him not to worry.
I'll be there to hold his hand

780
00:52:23.598 --> 00:52:25.433
and finish his little project for him.

781
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:32.524
-Anything else?
-How'd you do it?

782
00:52:34.901 --> 00:52:36.653
How'd you come back?

783
00:52:36.736 --> 00:52:38.280
(chuckles)

784
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:43.410
Scares you, doesn't it?
Hmm?

785
00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.705
The things I can do.

786
00:52:46.788 --> 00:52:50.000
Did you know I could create a force field
inside someone's body

787
00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:52.460
and expand it until they explode?

788
00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.088
Give it your best shot.

789
00:52:59.217 --> 00:53:01.261
Just get back to the lab.

790
00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.896
Mr. Storm.

791
00:53:10.979 --> 00:53:14.608
We're heading to intercept the Surfer
in ten minutes, with or without you.

792
00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:19.154
Were you just waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel?

793
00:53:19.237 --> 00:53:21.114
(sizzling)

794
00:53:26.328 --> 00:53:29.414
That was a joke. I was joking.

795
00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:32.417
Why are you so down on me?
You don't even know me.

796
00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:36.046
Actually, I know you very well.
I read your personality profile.

797
00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:41.509
Confident, reckless, irresponsible,
self-obsessed, bordering on narcissism.

798
00:53:41.593 --> 00:53:44.471
(chuckles)
Okay, so you do know me.

799
00:53:44.554 --> 00:53:46.932
All I've seen is a guy that
almost got his team killed.

800
00:53:48.975 --> 00:53:53.021
Okay. I've been a little
off my game lately.

801
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:55.523
This is not a game.

802
00:54:09.162 --> 00:54:11.623
Sir, he's holding his position
north of here.

803
00:54:11.706 --> 00:54:14.668
-Good.
-General, give us a one-mile perimeter.

804
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:17.545
Forget it, Richards.
You had your shot, and you blew it.

805
00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:20.173
This is a military operation now,
so jam the signal,

806
00:54:20.257 --> 00:54:22.759
get out of the way,
and let us do our job.

807
00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:25.637
-You don't understand.
-No,<i> you </i>don't understand.

808
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.932
So let me make it clear for you
and your pack of freaks here.

809
00:54:29.015 --> 00:54:32.060
I'm the quarterback.
You're on my team.

810
00:54:32.143 --> 00:54:33.853
Got it?

811
00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:37.399
But I guess you never played
football in high school.

812
00:54:37.482 --> 00:54:38.942
Did you, Richards?

813
00:54:40.318 --> 00:54:42.362
No, you're right. I didn't.

814
00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:45.240
I stayed in and studied
like a good little nerd.

815
00:54:47.242 --> 00:54:52.872
And 15 years later, I'm one of the
greatest minds of the 21st century,

816
00:54:52.956 --> 00:54:55.292
I'm engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet.

817
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:58.712
And the big jock who played quarterback
in high school,

818
00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:01.923
well, he's standing right in front of me,
asking me for my help.

819
00:55:02.882 --> 00:55:05.802
And I say he's not gonna
get a damn thing

820
00:55:05.885 --> 00:55:08.555
unless he does exactly what I tell him

821
00:55:08.638 --> 00:55:12.100
and starts treating my friends and me
with some respect.

822
00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:23.069
Give him what he wants.

823
00:55:25.864 --> 00:55:29.409
-I'm so hot for you right now.
-Me too!

824
00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:31.077
REED: Careful, Johnny.

825
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.079
All right. Let's go to work.

826
00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:45.508
This is it.

827
00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:47.761
You have your coordinates.

828
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:50.472
Set up your posts
and rendezvous back here.

829
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:03.860
First squad, move out!

830
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.449

(roaring)

833
00:56:36.017 --> 00:56:39.062
Hey. You scared me there, Smokey.

834
00:56:39.145 --> 00:56:41.272
Look at you. You're cute.

835
00:56:41.356 --> 00:56:42.732

Yeah, that's right.
Keep running, Boo-Boo!

<i>-BEN: Yeah, I'm good to go.</i>

842

Guys, we have a problem.

<i>-REED: What's wrong?</i>
-He's here.

847
00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:22.147
<i>REED: Get out here. Right now!</i>

848
00:57:44.252 --> 00:57:46.463
Why are you destroying our planet?

849
00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:50.300
I have no choice.

850
00:57:50.383 --> 00:57:52.510
-Sue!
-Wait!

851
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.724
What do you mean
you don't have a choice?

852
00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:00.435
There's always a choice.

853
00:58:00.518 --> 00:58:02.896
Not always.

854
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:07.192
Why are you trying to destroy us?

855
00:58:07.275 --> 00:58:10.153
I am not the destroyer.

Just jam the damn signal.

857
00:58:13.948 --> 00:58:15.658
Maybe he needs a little persuasion.

858
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.078
-Ready!
<i>-MAN: Fire one over the top.</i>

859
00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.497
Roger, out.

860
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.137
-Open fire.
-Open fire!

861
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:38.056
Fire! Repeat: open fire!

862
00:58:46.981 --> 00:58:48.608
Fall back! Fall back!

863
00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:51.945
(screaming)

864
00:58:52.028 --> 00:58:53.655
-Let me just--
-No, wait.

865
00:58:55.532 --> 00:58:56.824
Reed.

866
00:58:58.076 --> 00:58:59.327
REED: Come on, Sue.

867
00:59:00.286 --> 00:59:02.789
All right. It's up.

868
00:59:02.872 --> 00:59:04.332
Reed.

869
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:07.043
-Got him.
-(rumbling)

870
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:35.947
Not so tough now, are you?
(chuckles)

871
00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:45.123
Victor, stay back.

872
00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:47.750
You're the quarterback.

873
00:59:57.969 --> 00:59:59.887
(vehicles approaching)

874
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.600
Ah.

875
01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:08.354
Eyes on!
Keep your weapons trained!

876
01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.897
-Run your weapons tight!
-Perimeter secure!

877
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:11.357
Move him out.

878
01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.067
(dog barking)

879
01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:17.864
Open the gate.

880
01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.991
(men talking)

881
01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.208
(dog continues barking)

882
01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:35.340
-But, General, we had an agreement.
-Calm down.

883
01:00:35.423 --> 01:00:37.258
The enemy has been captured--
mission accomplished.

884
01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.010
-Where is he?
-Contained.

885
01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:41.137
MAN: General.

886
01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.015
Mr. Sherman.

887
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.728
If you'll excuse us,
we have work to do.

888
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.522
-I want to be there for the questioning.
-That's not gonna happen.

889
01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:56.069
Please make sure our guests
remain here comfortably.

890
01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:59.656
-MAN: Yes, sir.
-(door slams)

891
01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.658
General, what about the board?

892
01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:04.577
It's in a chamber which continuously
scrambles the signal.

893
01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:25.473
There are certain things
I'm not permitted to do

894
01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:28.643
because they're considered
human rights violations.

895
01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:32.063
Fortunately, you're not human.

896
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.029
Are we prisoners?

897
01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.740
(chuckles) How did that happen?

898
01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.743
Apparently, they don't want us
interfering with their methods.

899
01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.204
I can't even imagine what
they're doing to him in there.

900
01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:51.457
-I say he gets what he deserves.
-How can you say that?

901
01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:54.711
I'm just saying that maybe
the general is right about this.

902
01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:57.964
The guy was about to destroy the planet.
He said so himself.

903
01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.799
But it doesn't make any sense.

904
01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:01.300
He protected me from the missile.

905
01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.512
-Why would he do that?
-Maybe he thinks you're cute.

906
01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:07.640
There's a lot more going on here.
He said he wasn't the destroyer.

907
01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.517
Uh, maybe he lied.

908
01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:15.356
We need to get inside there
and talk to him.

909
01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:19.152
But under the radar.

910
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:26.284
Hey, uh, is there any way
we can get some DVDs

911
01:02:26.367 --> 01:02:28.369
or popcorn or something,
just to pass the time?

912
01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:32.290
-I'll call it in, Mr. Storm.
-Great. Thank you.<i> Semper fi.</i>

913
01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:35.126
That's the marine corps.
We're the army.

914
01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.628
Right. I know. It's the army.

915
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:46.971
<i>COMPUTERIZED VOICE:</i>
<i>Captain Raye, access granted.</i>

916
01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:05.406
General, Von Doom
wants to speak with you.

917
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:09.660
You should really be
a little more cooperative.

918
01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.498
Mr. Sherman, let's take a break.

919
01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:32.642
I know you are there.

920
01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:47.114
What's your name?

921
01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.494
Come on.
You must have a name.

922
01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:53.996
I'm Susan.

923
01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.337
You said you weren't the one
trying to destroy our world.

924
01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.964
Then who is?

925
01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:06.342
-The one I serve.
-Who do you serve?

926
01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.555
Look, I'm trying to help you.

927
01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.850
But in order to do that,
you have to tell me the truth.

928
01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.351
Please.

929
01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:29.240
It is known by many names.

930
01:04:29.323 --> 01:04:32.702
My people called it...
Galactus.

931
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.621
The devourer of worlds.

932
01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:42.587
It must feed on energy to survive,

933
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:46.340
both thermal and organic.

934
01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.719
-How could you willingly serve this thing?
-Because I must.

935
01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:54.515
Doesn't it bother you? All the worlds
and innocent people you've helped destroy?

936
01:04:54.599 --> 01:05:00.563
My service spares my world...
and the one I love.

937
01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.443
Why did you try to protect me?

938
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.821
Because...

939
01:05:10.114 --> 01:05:12.617
...you remind me of her.

940
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.002
(door opens)

941
01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:29.926
Could you stop the destroyer
if you wanted to?

942
01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:32.845
It is not I who draws the destroyer here.

943
01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:35.264
-It is the beacon.
-What's the beacon?

944
01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.477
-The source of my power.
-Your board?

945
01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:47.526
Take joy in the last few hours
you have left,

946
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.196
for he is nearly here.

947
01:05:51.989 --> 01:05:53.908
(loud rumbling)

948
01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:10.591
Well, I helped deliver
the alien to you as promised.

949
01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:12.969
Now it's time to keep
your end of the bargain.

950
01:06:14.595 --> 01:06:16.722
You can do your tests on the board.

951
01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:22.186
But under armed guard
and in my presence only.

952
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:23.938
Absolutely.

953
01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.864
<i>COMPUTERIZED VOICE:</i>
<i>General Hager, access granted.</i>

954
01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:59.306
And the board
is what's drawing it here.

955
01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.434
How do you fight something
that can eat planets?

956
01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:04.270
We have to get to the board and lead it
away from here before it's too late.

957
01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.814
Well, do you think the general
will go for that?

958
01:07:07.898 --> 01:07:09.108
He'll have no choice.

959
01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.654
VICTOR: Thank you, General.

960
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.950
But I'm afraid, the truth is...

961
01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.245
...that sometimes Reed is right.

962
01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.208
What?

963
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.973
Hey, you, come here.

964
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.142
Let me ask you something.

965
01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:05.498
(beeping)

966

(gunshots)

967
01:08:45.204 --> 01:08:46.831
Nice.

Aw, crap.

Ben!

970
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.518
Okay, that one hurt.

971
01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:09.520
Where's Reed?

972
01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:10.896
REED (muffled): Back here.

973
01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:22.992
My bad.

974
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:32.543
SUE: Reed.

975
01:09:37.214 --> 01:09:39.842
Victor. We've got to get it back.

976
01:09:39.925 --> 01:09:41.177
We need to get the Surfer.

977
01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.053
He's the only one
that understands its power.

978
01:09:43.137 --> 01:09:46.724
Even if we break him out of this place,
how are we gonna catch up to Victor?

979
01:09:48.601 --> 01:09:49.894
Leave that to me.

-Where is General Hager?
-He's dead.

If we don't get him out of here,
we're all gonna be.

Course.

Okay, Ben, you get inside.
Johnny, you fly behind us.

1001
01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.413
-Dude, you gotta let me fly this thing.
-Forget about it.

1002
01:11:32.496 --> 01:11:33.664
I'm the best pilot here.
I should drive.

1003

-JOHNNY: Are you serious?
-Guys!

1004
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.583
We'll be lucky if this thing can
carry you!

-Guys!

Ah, shut up!
And move it!

Okay, we're now officially enemies
of the United States of America,

Victor is out there somewhere
with unlimited power,

1011
01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:05.112
and we've got a giant intergalactic force

1012
01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:08.490
that's about to destroy our
planet in less than 24 hours.

1013
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.159
Did I miss anything?

1014
01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:13.203
REED: I've got a lock
on Victor's energy trail.

1015
01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:16.248
He's headed over Southeast China.
Hang on.

1016
01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:22.254
Norrin Radd.

1017
01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:24.548
What?

1018
01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:28.260
I was once called Norrin Radd.

1019
01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.555
Norrin, we're gonna need
your help to save our world.

1020
01:12:31.638 --> 01:12:33.307
Do you understand?

1021
01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:40.856
-Whoa!
-What the hell was that?

1022
01:12:42.941 --> 01:12:45.652
Victor, the board
is drawing the destroyer here!

1023
01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.571
You have to give it up!

1024
01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:50.657
You know, I've never been
the giving type, Reed.

1025
01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.034
Hold on.

1026
01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:02.211
(screams)

1027
01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:09.009
-We're sitting ducks!
-We're gonna have to split up!

1028
01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:10.719
-What?
-This ought to be fun.

1029
01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.263
REED: Stay close to me, Sue!

1030
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:42.501
He's really pissing me off!

1031
01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:51.135
Surf's up, metal head.

1032
01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:56.765
Victor, only the Surfer
can stop the destroyer!

1033
01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.101
But he needs his board!

1034
01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.478
-Come and get it, Richards.
-Victor!

1035
01:14:06.066 --> 01:14:08.694
Let's all go for a spin!

1036
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.199
(grunting)

1037
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:26.378
-(screams)
-(people screaming)

1038
01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.888
(shouting in Mandarin)

1039
01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.973
(moaning)

1040
01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.109
Norrin!

1041
01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.113
Catch.

1042
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.659
(grunting)

1043
01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:08.795
Sue!

1044
01:15:13.258 --> 01:15:15.427
Oh, my God.

1045
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.221
Sue. Sue.

1046
01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.806
-Oh, God.
-Johnny, don't touch her.

1047
01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:23.393
(coughs)

1048
01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:27.064
-Oh, God. Oh, God.
-You need to find a way to get the board.

1049
01:15:27.147 --> 01:15:29.066
-Sue, I--
-Okay?

1050
01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.821
(rumbling)

1051
01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:39.076
He is here.

1052
01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:48.627
Reed.

1053
01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:51.213
Reed.

1054
01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.425
Victor's got to have a pulse emitter
linking him to his board.

1055
01:15:56.635 --> 01:16:00.222
We take it out, we can separate
him from his board.

1056
01:16:00.305 --> 01:16:02.432
-He's too strong for me.
-I could whale on him,

1057
01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:03.809
if I could get close enough.

1058
01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.895
But he could see me coming
from a mile away.

1059
01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.356
It would take all of us.

1060
01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:13.193
Or maybe just one of us.

1061
01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:19.366
We don't know
what it could do to you.

1062
01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.328
Let's not make this about me.

1063
01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.173
(rumbling)

1064
01:16:45.183 --> 01:16:48.937
To quote a friend of mine,
it's clobbering time.

1065
01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.564
(gasps)

1066
01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.583
(grunts)

1067
01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:14.171
(straining)

1068
01:17:29.853 --> 01:17:31.730
(grunting)

1069
01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:39.488
(growling)

1070
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.537
You ain't going down fighting, kid.

1071
01:17:49.581 --> 01:17:50.791
Not without me.

1072
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:02.302
(rumbling)

1073
01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.866
(people chattering)

1074
01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:29.931
You've got to go.

1075
01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:03.882
Treasure each moment with her,

1076
01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.134
and tell her she was right--

1077
01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:10.347
We do have a choice.

1078
01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.028
(wind roaring)

1079
01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.166
Thought you could use a hand.

1080
01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:44.297
Oh, my God.

1081
01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:57.394
(rumbling)

1082
01:21:06.611 --> 01:21:08.488
(screaming)

1083
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.287
Why isn't it working?

1084
01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.790
We were too late.

1085
01:21:27.173 --> 01:21:29.968
I will no longer serve.

1086
01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:36.057
This is the end for us both.

1087
01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:04.586
(roaring)

1088
01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:24.439
(roaring stops)

1089
01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:34.532
(electrical crackling)

1090
01:22:58.473 --> 01:22:59.891
Hi.

1091
01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.395
Hi.

1092
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:10.944
-What'd I miss?
-(chuckles)

1093
01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.323
(laughing)

1094
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.537
(chuckles) Hey! Hey!

1095
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.956
-He did it.
-Great job, kid.

1096
01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:24.916
Whoa, whoa.

1097
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.836
Hey, wait. I'm not changing.

1098
01:23:27.919 --> 01:23:30.714
-Hey, that's right.
-(laughing)

1099
01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.925
Great! Oh, okay.

1100
01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.636
-Now you're making me uncomfortable.
-Sorry.

1101
01:23:55.488 --> 01:23:57.282
So, I guess this is it.

1102
01:23:58.742 --> 01:24:01.077
We all go our separate ways.

1103
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:06.249
-No.
-No?

1104
01:24:06.332 --> 01:24:09.169
If it wasn't for the team,
the whole world would be gone by now.

1105
01:24:09.252 --> 01:24:10.754
We can't run away from
our responsibilities

1106
01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:12.589
and the people we need to protect.

1107
01:24:12.672 --> 01:24:14.924
-This is who we are.
-That's what I've been saying.

1108
01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.594
What about having a normal life, a family?

1109
01:24:17.677 --> 01:24:19.971
Who says you have to be normal
to have a family?

1110
01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.976
So you up for another
media circus wedding?

1111
01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:28.188
-Fifth time's the charm.
-(sighs) No.

1112
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:30.940
(chuckles)

1113
01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.901
I've got a better idea.

1114
01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:49.209
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
to join Reed Richards

1115
01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:51.461
-and Sue Storm together--
-(PDA beeping)

1116
01:24:51.544 --> 01:24:53.713
in holy matri--

1117
01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.174
-(beeping)
-(whispers) What is it?

1118
01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.468
Venice is sinking into the Adriatic.

1119
01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:00.470
Oh, boy. That's a biggie.

1120
01:25:00.553 --> 01:25:03.139
Could we just skip to the end?

1121
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:06.893
-Yeah, uh, the love these two share--
-No, the very end.

1122
01:25:06.976 --> 01:25:09.562
Yeah, great.
Uh, you have the rings?

1123
01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:11.564
Oh.

1124
01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.824
Oh, yeah.
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1125
01:25:20.907 --> 01:25:22.617
And you may kiss the bride.

1126
01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:25.453
(chuckles)

1127
01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:32.502
-Okay. We should get out of here.
-Yeah.

1128
01:25:32.585 --> 01:25:34.295
-Got to go, hon.
-Okay.

1129
01:25:39.425 --> 01:25:42.428
I have to throw the bouquet.
Ready?

1130
01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.472
(women giggling)

1131
01:25:48.017 --> 01:25:49.727
(women screaming, laughing)

1132
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.857
Heads up, Johnny.

1133
01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:59.320
(fire roaring)

1134
01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.869
Sorry.

1135
01:26:07.078 --> 01:26:08.997
Reflex.

1136
01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.584
(women laughing, chattering in Japanese)
