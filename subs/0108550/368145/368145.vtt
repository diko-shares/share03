1
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.085
Five...

2
00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:37.490
nine, ten, eleven...

3
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:39.461
twelve, thirteen,
nineteen, seventeen...

4
00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:41.463
Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.066
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:49.103
You want some corn?

7
00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:51.333
- I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:59.414
Good?

9
00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.277
Not good corn.

10
00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:09.952
Gilbert...

11
00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:11.550
are they gonna come soon?

12
00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:14.620
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

13
00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:16.325
Pretty soon.

14
00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.333
I want them to come.

15
00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.634
- You wanna go home?
- No.

16
00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:24.640
I wanna see 'em.

17
00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:29.068
They're gonna come soon, huh?

18
00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:32.273
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

19
00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:33.976
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?

20
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.677
- Yep.
- Okay.

21
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.894
That's them, huh?
Look, it's them!

22
00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.330
Look! Look over there!

23
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:03.575
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

24
00:02:08.084 --> 00:02:10.712
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

25
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:16.757
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 18.

26
00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:18.817
My family's planning
a big party for him.

27
00:02:21.665 --> 00:02:23.826
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

28
00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:27.900
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

29
00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:34.301
God, Arnie.
You're gettin' so big.

30
00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:37.540
Pretty soon, I ain't gonna
be able to carry you no more.

31
00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:40.708
You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.

32
00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:43.412
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

33
00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:45.579
You're shrinking, Gilbert.

34
00:02:59.602 --> 00:03:01.331
Endora.

35
00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.201
Endora's where we are.

36
00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:07.073
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

37
00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.280
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

38
00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.749
and nothing much ever will.

39
00:03:16.753 --> 00:03:19.745
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

40
00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:22.587
And miles out of town on
the interstate, there's Foodland...

41
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.355
where everyone else shops.

42
00:03:27.797 --> 00:03:29.822
This is where I live
with my family.

43
00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:33.460
My dad built the house, and it's
my job to keep up the repairs.

44
00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:40.304
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

45
00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:43.039
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

46
00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:46.014
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time. "

47
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:01.862
- Some days you want him to live...
- The head.

48
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.523
some days you don't.

49
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.194
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

50
00:04:10.673 --> 00:04:13.699
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.

51
00:04:13.777 --> 00:04:15.472
I know, buddy.

52
00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:23.912
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

53
00:04:25.355 --> 00:04:29.257
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

54
00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:31.293
until it burned down last year.

55
00:04:34.164 --> 00:04:36.155
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

56
00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:40.225
She got her braces off, and she's
been walking around going "Ooh, ah."

57
00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:42.863
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

58
00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:53.680
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

59
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.014
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

60
00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:58.452
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

61
00:04:58.521 --> 00:05:01.513
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...

62
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:03.456
Mama's had her hands full.

63
00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:05.960
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

64
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.126
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

65
00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:16.101
- I'm Gilbert.
- Ellen, I need your help.

66
00:05:16.172 --> 00:05:19.266
- What is it?
- Gilbert Grape.

67
00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:26.043
Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

68
00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:28.107
I don't know, Mama.

69
00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:29.879
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

70
00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:37.217
Gilbert, get him down from there.

71
00:05:38.928 --> 00:05:41.055
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

72
00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:46.063
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

73
00:05:46.136 --> 00:05:48.070
I thought he was with you.

74
00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:52.071
I wonder where he is.

75
00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:53.973
Gee, I don't know.

76
00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:55.977
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

77
00:05:56.045 --> 00:05:58.878
He's in the tree.

78
00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:02.315
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

79
00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:05.252
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

80
00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:06.913
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:13.659
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

82
00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:19.125
- I was up there!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

83
00:06:19.202 --> 00:06:21.136
I was right up there.

84
00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:12.979
Can I help you with anything?

85
00:07:15.524 --> 00:07:17.583
Thank you, and good-bye.

86
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.291
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

87
00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.630
Is something goin' on at Foodland?

88
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.161
I wouldn't know, sir.
I don't shop there. I'd rather die.

89
00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:33.299
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

90
00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:41.440
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

91
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.518
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

92
00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:47.283
Am I right?

93
00:07:47.356 --> 00:07:50.484
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

94
00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:54.154
It's just a phase. People
will come back here, believe me.

95
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.221
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.

96
00:07:59.168 --> 00:08:02.934
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

97
00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:12.476
- Can I have these two?
- No, just one.

98
00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:14.482
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

99
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.381
Say "Thank you."

100
00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:18.716
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

101
00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:22.189
Gilbert? That was Mrs. Carver
needing a delivery.

102
00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:24.954
Could you?

103
00:08:32.868 --> 00:08:34.699
Boys, go on outside.

104
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.739
- But we don't want to.
- Yeah, we don't want to.

105
00:08:37.807 --> 00:08:39.001
Go play.

106
00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:48.244
Get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

107
00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:52.310
Okay. I was counting.

108
00:09:17.446 --> 00:09:21.382
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

109
00:09:30.192 --> 00:09:31.557
Hey, kids, let's play!

110
00:09:31.627 --> 00:09:34.061
Come on!

111
00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:38.031
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

112
00:09:42.438 --> 00:09:44.668
The ice cream's gonna melt...

113
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.173
soon.

114
00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:52.703
You're right.
It is melting.

115
00:10:27.383 --> 00:10:29.351
Oh, my God!

116
00:10:32.955 --> 00:10:35.822
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

117
00:10:39.028 --> 00:10:41.690
- Come on up. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.

118
00:10:41.764 --> 00:10:44.790
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

119
00:10:45.868 --> 00:10:48.302
- You want a pool?
- Yeah, we want a pool.

120
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.702
Come on up.
Up, up, up, up.

121
00:10:58.013 --> 00:11:00.675
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

122
00:11:05.854 --> 00:11:09.119
Gilbert, come here for a second.

123
00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.393
- Here.
- Oh, no, really.

124
00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:23.529
Oh, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

125
00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:27.841
Thank you.

126
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.639
- Thank you.
- Bye, Gilbert.

127
00:11:32.948 --> 00:11:35.610
Come by my office.

128
00:11:35.684 --> 00:11:37.584
We need to talk.

129
00:11:56.739 --> 00:12:00.140
Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.

130
00:12:00.209 --> 00:12:01.676
Arnie, get down!

131
00:12:01.744 --> 00:12:03.678
Come on, son.
We've had enough fun for one day.

132
00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:05.338
Come on down.

133
00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:16.156
- Son?
- Yeah?

134
00:12:16.225 --> 00:12:19.092
- Come on down.
- No!

135
00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:21.356
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

136
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:25.361
Son, come on down.

137
00:12:25.434 --> 00:12:27.368
I'm gonna go up there!

138
00:12:29.772 --> 00:12:32.764
- Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

139
00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:34.706
Hi!

140
00:12:36.278 --> 00:12:38.678
Okay, son.
Come on down.

141
00:12:40.082 --> 00:12:41.413
I'm gonna go up here!

142
00:12:42.351 --> 00:12:43.511
Come on, son.

143
00:12:43.585 --> 00:12:46.986
I'm goin' higher than before!

144
00:12:47.056 --> 00:12:48.421
I'm goin' high!

145
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:52.085
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
Come on down.

146
00:12:52.161 --> 00:12:54.755
Hey, Bob.
Yeah, here we go again.

147
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.856
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburetors...

148
00:12:57.933 --> 00:13:00.026
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...

149
00:13:00.102 --> 00:13:03.230
that that is a complicated unit.

150
00:13:03.305 --> 00:13:07.469
I understand. I can do it myself,
but I need the part.

151
00:13:07.543 --> 00:13:09.408
Look, let me show you.

152
00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:11.810
See, it's this
little guy right here.

153
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.216
The needle valve is worn down.

154
00:13:14.349 --> 00:13:16.943
I need a new one.
Can we order it?

155
00:13:17.018 --> 00:13:18.485
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:13:18.553 --> 00:13:22.353
- I can order it.
- How long will that take?

157
00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:25.188
- Probably a week.
- A week?

158
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.023
Don't make us come get you.

159
00:13:27.095 --> 00:13:29.529
You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

160
00:13:35.203 --> 00:13:37.364
I'm not gonna fall!

161
00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:46.813
My shoe done fell off.

162
00:13:53.722 --> 00:13:56.850
I know a boy
whose name is Arnie

163
00:13:56.925 --> 00:14:00.986
He's about to turn 18
and have a big party

164
00:14:01.062 --> 00:14:03.690
I know a boy
whose name is Arnie

165
00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:09.228
Come on down, buddy.
Come on.

166
00:14:16.044 --> 00:14:18.808
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

167
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:43.201
Good boy.
Come on down, buddy.

168
00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:00.755
Here we go. Thanks a lot, Jerry.
Really sorry.

169
00:15:00.822 --> 00:15:03.655
Good boy. Good boy.

170
00:15:03.725 --> 00:15:06.888
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

171
00:15:06.961 --> 00:15:09.725
We hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days...

172
00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:11.732
he's right back up there again.

173
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.928
But this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

174
00:15:15.003 --> 00:15:16.868
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

175
00:15:18.473 --> 00:15:21.636
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

176
00:15:26.047 --> 00:15:29.073
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.

177
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.618
Don't touch him.

178
00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:34.086
Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?

179
00:15:34.155 --> 00:15:36.089
Get out of here.

180
00:15:36.157 --> 00:15:38.591
Could you help me out later
with the fridge?

181
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.458
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

182
00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:44.054
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

183
00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:46.828
All right.
I have to get my tools.

184
00:15:46.901 --> 00:15:50.302
I'll just come by later.
You be careful, all right?

185
00:15:56.578 --> 00:15:59.638
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

186
00:16:03.218 --> 00:16:05.982
I disappeared on Mom like that.

187
00:16:06.054 --> 00:16:09.148
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

188
00:16:09.224 --> 00:16:11.522
- Will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

189
00:16:11.593 --> 00:16:14.221
Good boy. Good boy.

190
00:16:15.463 --> 00:16:17.055
The food.

191
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:22.730
Are we ready
to talk about the party?

192
00:16:22.804 --> 00:16:26.205
- Sure.
- Ellen's in charge of decorations.

193
00:16:26.274 --> 00:16:27.866
Purple, orange and green.

194
00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:29.273
- Sounds good.
- Theme colors.

195
00:16:29.344 --> 00:16:31.278
That sounds pretty good.

196
00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.610
I'm doing the food, the cake.

197
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.611
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

198
00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:40.613
And Mama,
you can supervise everything.

199
00:16:40.688 --> 00:16:43.350
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.

200
00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:45.359
- Sounds good.
- What about me?

201
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:49.027
You are the guest of honor.
How about that?

202
00:16:49.097 --> 00:16:51.930
What about me?
It's my party!

203
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.831
You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

204
00:16:53.902 --> 00:16:56.393
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

205
00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:59.338
All you have to do is turn 18.

206
00:16:59.407 --> 00:17:01.238
You know, that just leaves Gilbert.

207
00:17:02.277 --> 00:17:04.837
You're the only one
without anything to do.

208
00:17:04.913 --> 00:17:06.904
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

209
00:17:06.981 --> 00:17:09.711
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

210
00:17:09.784 --> 00:17:12.252
I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.

211
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.721
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

212
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.088
- Stop it, Ellen.
- Can I be excused?

213
00:17:18.159 --> 00:17:22.391
- He never does anything!
- Can't we do something as a family?

214
00:17:22.464 --> 00:17:24.432
- This is no fair!
- Can I please be excused?

215
00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:28.993
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!

216
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.905
So it's gonna be an exact copy of
the original they built in Boone.

217
00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.409
- Really?
- Which is no big deal.

218
00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:40.107
All Burger Barns
are built identical.

219
00:17:40.181 --> 00:17:42.615
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

220
00:17:42.684 --> 00:17:45.016
It's so efficient.
It's amazing.

221
00:17:45.086 --> 00:17:47.179
In a matter of a couple days...

222
00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:49.314
there can be
a whole new restaurant.

223
00:17:50.425 --> 00:17:53.155
So I was driving past
the building site today.

224
00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:57.130
You know, it's goin' up
right down the road from Foodland.

225
00:17:57.198 --> 00:17:59.792
The general manager was there.
So I says...

226
00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:02.462
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

227
00:18:03.638 --> 00:18:05.765
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good.

228
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.469
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

229
00:18:09.544 --> 00:18:12.707
saltin' some fries.

230
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.874
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

231
00:18:19.687 --> 00:18:21.382
Get out of here!

232
00:18:23.224 --> 00:18:24.816
I saw her!

233
00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:29.689
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

234
00:18:29.764 --> 00:18:31.629
You know what you did.

235
00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:34.361
That's your mother in there.

236
00:18:34.435 --> 00:18:36.494
- Your mother.
- I know.

237
00:18:38.773 --> 00:18:41.264
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

238
00:18:41.342 --> 00:18:43.867
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

239
00:18:43.945 --> 00:18:46.311
Come on.

240
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:48.975
Run, now! Run!

241
00:18:51.686 --> 00:18:54.553
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.

242
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.843
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

243
00:19:19.914 --> 00:19:21.711
Gotta go to sleep, okay?

244
00:19:21.783 --> 00:19:24.308
Okay. Good-bye.

245
00:19:24.385 --> 00:19:26.410
No, it's not good-bye.
It's good night.

246
00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:31.686
Good-bye is for when
you're going away.

247
00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:33.693
And we're not going anywhere,
are we?

248
00:19:33.761 --> 00:19:35.661
I know that.

249
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.891
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

250
00:19:37.966 --> 00:19:41.129
We're not going anywhere!

251
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.298
Good-bye!

252
00:19:55.082 --> 00:19:56.982
- You gotta work later?
- Yeah, I do.

253
00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.746
Hi there, ladies.

254
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.721
- I gotta come back.
- How's Mama?

255
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:04.986
- She's fat.
- Come on, man.

256
00:20:05.059 --> 00:20:07.550
- She's not all that big.
- What?

257
00:20:07.628 --> 00:20:11.928
I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

258
00:20:11.999 --> 00:20:13.990
A little bit bigger?

259
00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:16.593
All I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.

260
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:19.196
- Tucker, she's a whale!
- Take her out for a walk.

261
00:20:19.273 --> 00:20:22.731
- Take her out for a jog.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

262
00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:28.043
- I'm just sayin' give her a chance.
- Hi, guys.

263
00:20:28.115 --> 00:20:31.414
- How's business?
- Not good.

264
00:20:31.486 --> 00:20:33.545
Nobody's dying.

265
00:20:33.621 --> 00:20:37.387
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

266
00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:40.256
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

267
00:20:40.328 --> 00:20:42.523
That's a good thing for you to do.

268
00:20:42.597 --> 00:20:44.895
If you guys would give it a chance...

269
00:20:44.966 --> 00:20:48.333
I just was saying that it wasn't
something I should be doing myself.

270
00:20:48.402 --> 00:20:50.097
They use canola oil, okay?

271
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.196
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.

272
00:20:52.273 --> 00:20:54.537
They probably don't sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

273
00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:58.375
It's cutting edge.
It creates a crispier french fry...

274
00:20:58.446 --> 00:21:01.381
and a more unique product.

275
00:21:01.449 --> 00:21:04.941
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
Burger King, McDonald's.

276
00:21:05.019 --> 00:21:07.647
That's old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

277
00:21:07.722 --> 00:21:10.156
I mean,
I could really stand behind it.

278
00:21:10.224 --> 00:21:13.455
It's an innovative place.
They created the salad bar...

279
00:21:13.528 --> 00:21:18.158
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

280
00:21:18.232 --> 00:21:19.756
They came up with that.

281
00:21:19.834 --> 00:21:23.998
Fifteen different toppings for
each salad, two kinds of lettuce.

282
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:27.598
And it's all that you care to eat.

283
00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:32.670
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

284
00:21:32.747 --> 00:21:35.580
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

285
00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.208
to assistant manager.

286
00:21:37.285 --> 00:21:41.278
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to manager...

287
00:21:41.355 --> 00:21:44.449
and then regional manager
and then...

288
00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:55.901
Look at the little fellas.

289
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.063
You mean my hoppers.

290
00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:00.073
Let's try this.

291
00:22:00.141 --> 00:22:01.733
For my friend.

292
00:22:04.946 --> 00:22:07.141
There you go, my boy.

293
00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:09.944
What do you say, Arnie?

294
00:22:10.017 --> 00:22:13.111
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

295
00:22:22.797 --> 00:22:24.492
This Thursday.

296
00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:29.567
It's our anniversary.

297
00:23:04.605 --> 00:23:06.539
I'll need a delivery later.

298
00:23:15.116 --> 00:23:17.380
Have a nice day.

299
00:23:24.492 --> 00:23:26.926
He's behind the chips.

300
00:23:29.764 --> 00:23:31.891
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

301
00:23:31.966 --> 00:23:35.299
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

302
00:23:36.303 --> 00:23:38.271
Yes, sir.

303
00:23:39.173 --> 00:23:41.300
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

304
00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.344
I'll do it, Gilbert.

305
00:23:50.017 --> 00:23:52.076
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

306
00:23:54.388 --> 00:23:56.447
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.

307
00:23:56.524 --> 00:23:58.389
I did it by myself.

308
00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:01.986
Yeah. Look at that.

309
00:24:16.077 --> 00:24:18.204
I could go at any time.

310
00:24:21.048 --> 00:24:22.572
Any time.

311
00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:26.787
Excuse me. Where to?

312
00:24:26.854 --> 00:24:28.617
Just keep going straight.

313
00:24:30.658 --> 00:24:32.250
All right.

314
00:24:33.928 --> 00:24:36.863
My mom wants me to become 18.

315
00:24:36.931 --> 00:24:40.332
I'm having a big party, huh?

316
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:43.700
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.

317
00:24:43.771 --> 00:24:46.706
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

318
00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:49.538
I'm 18, and you're not invited.

319
00:24:51.278 --> 00:24:53.678
- Don't be rude.
- It's okay.

320
00:24:53.748 --> 00:24:56.512
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

321
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.990
- I got the groceries!
- Be careful with them.

322
00:25:09.063 --> 00:25:11.657
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

323
00:25:16.771 --> 00:25:19.865
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

324
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.307
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm really sorry.

325
00:25:24.278 --> 00:25:26.109
It's okay.

326
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.171
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

327
00:25:29.216 --> 00:25:30.683
Are you sorry?

328
00:25:33.387 --> 00:25:35.753
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

329
00:25:35.823 --> 00:25:38.053
Don't be sorry.

330
00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:40.491
I'm not sorry.

331
00:25:45.299 --> 00:25:48.325
If people are gonna come that early,
we should have some appetizers.

332
00:25:48.402 --> 00:25:51.530
That'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

333
00:25:51.605 --> 00:25:54.842
You put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

334
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:58.070
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

335
00:25:58.145 --> 00:26:01.410
You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers they make with...

336
00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:03.415
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can...

337
00:26:03.483 --> 00:26:06.111
and you wrap them with
little pieces of bacon...

338
00:26:06.186 --> 00:26:08.381
- and put a toothpick through 'em.
- How do you cook the bacon?

339
00:26:09.122 --> 00:26:10.612
In the oven on a pan.

340
00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:14.183
The bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

341
00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:16.388
- Yes, it will.
- Nobody wants greasy...

342
00:26:16.463 --> 00:26:19.193
- I want hot dogs!
- floppy bacon.

343
00:26:19.266 --> 00:26:22.929
- I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

344
00:26:23.003 --> 00:26:26.200
I promise,
we're gonna have hot dogs.

345
00:26:26.273 --> 00:26:30.710
The thing about every party
that I've been to is that... What?

346
00:26:30.777 --> 00:26:33.371
Could you not talk
with your mouth full?

347
00:26:33.447 --> 00:26:34.744
Excuse me?

348
00:26:34.815 --> 00:26:37.545
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

349
00:26:39.152 --> 00:26:40.881
Okay, Dad.

350
00:26:42.189 --> 00:26:44.350
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

351
00:26:44.424 --> 00:26:47.416
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

352
00:26:47.494 --> 00:26:49.985
- Stop it, you guys.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

353
00:26:51.298 --> 00:26:54.165
- I can't believe you said that.
- Shut up!

354
00:26:54.234 --> 00:26:55.667
Dad's dead!

355
00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:57.499
- Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

356
00:26:58.906 --> 00:27:02.433
Arnie, it's okay.
Stop it now.

357
00:27:02.509 --> 00:27:04.636
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

358
00:27:05.712 --> 00:27:08.840
- Mama, don't get upset.
- Make him stop.

359
00:27:08.916 --> 00:27:11.180
- Arnie, shut up!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!

360
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:13.947
- You're crazy, Arnie!
- Stop it.

361
00:27:18.025 --> 00:27:20.323
- Just calm down.
- Stop it!

362
00:27:20.394 --> 00:27:23.022
- Stop it!
- That's enough!

363
00:27:23.096 --> 00:27:25.291
Arnie, that's enough!

364
00:27:25.365 --> 00:27:28.334
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

365
00:27:28.402 --> 00:27:31.166
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Dad's dead!

366
00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:33.798
I said, stop it right now!

367
00:27:36.677 --> 00:27:38.736
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

368
00:27:38.812 --> 00:27:41.212
and the space
between 'em here should...

369
00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:43.647
Right now, it's at two feet.

370
00:27:43.717 --> 00:27:46.083
This should be 16 inches.
I mean, that's just standard.

371
00:27:46.153 --> 00:27:49.884
And this right here...
See this here? Flat flooring?

372
00:27:49.957 --> 00:27:53.950
Once the wood gets old,
you're gonna fall right through it.

373
00:27:54.695 --> 00:27:56.629
I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

374
00:27:58.932 --> 00:28:02.868
Gilbert, why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

375
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:05.865
- What?
- Keep it down.

376
00:28:05.939 --> 00:28:07.497
Sorry.

377
00:28:18.618 --> 00:28:20.483
She's coming.
She's coming.

378
00:28:40.107 --> 00:28:41.802
You all right?
You okay?

379
00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:43.843
Yeah, I'm fine.

380
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.434
Thanks a lot for coming.

381
00:28:45.512 --> 00:28:48.242
I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.

382
00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:50.875
Let's keep it quiet.
I forgot to tell you.

383
00:28:50.951 --> 00:28:52.612
- What?
- Burger Barn.

384
00:28:52.686 --> 00:28:54.711
I'm in. I got the call.

385
00:28:54.788 --> 00:28:57.655
- Good.
- It's not too late, you know.

386
00:28:57.724 --> 00:28:58.952
Good night.

387
00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.361
I think she's asleep.

388
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.730
Say you wanna slice down zucchini
squash in the food dehydrator.

389
00:29:07.801 --> 00:29:10.429
- Look at this.
- Wonderful!

390
00:29:10.504 --> 00:29:14.304
- Perfect slices every time. Nice?
- Marvelous.

391
00:29:14.374 --> 00:29:16.899
'Course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...

392
00:29:16.977 --> 00:29:18.774
take the corn off the cob.

393
00:29:18.845 --> 00:29:21.439
Look at this. We'll just
turn down the dial a little...

394
00:29:26.887 --> 00:29:29.856
... freeze corn and sit there
for hours with a knife...

395
00:29:29.923 --> 00:29:31.515
literally hours,
cutting their corn.

396
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:34.253
- Unbelievable!
- 'Course, for un...

397
00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:41.032
- Right now, you get the...
- What are you doing?

398
00:29:41.101 --> 00:29:43.535
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

399
00:29:43.603 --> 00:29:45.036
Jeez.

400
00:29:46.373 --> 00:29:51.401
The $30 Dial-O-Matic Food Slicer,
a $ 160 value, right now.

401
00:29:51.478 --> 00:29:53.412
I made up that bed for you.

402
00:29:54.948 --> 00:29:56.677
What for?

403
00:29:58.151 --> 00:30:00.119
Just in case you wanted a change.

404
00:30:01.455 --> 00:30:04.083
I'm happy right where I am.

405
00:30:04.157 --> 00:30:07.524
- You sure?
- Yeah.

406
00:30:20.874 --> 00:30:22.466
Here you go.

407
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.773
Here you go, Mama.

408
00:30:28.849 --> 00:30:30.339
Thanks, kids.

409
00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:32.408
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

410
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:43.786
I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

411
00:30:43.864 --> 00:30:45.798
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

412
00:30:45.866 --> 00:30:48.061
What's she doing here?

413
00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:50.000
I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

414
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.799
I think their car broke down.

415
00:30:51.872 --> 00:30:53.635
Come on.
I see it in your face.

416
00:30:53.707 --> 00:30:57.507
Can we not talk about this now?
Can we change the subject?

417
00:30:57.577 --> 00:30:59.169
Do you understand?

418
00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.840
We want a pool.

419
00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:08.217
- You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

420
00:31:08.288 --> 00:31:10.882
Look at those guys out there.

421
00:31:10.957 --> 00:31:15.223
They're laughing,
they're all happy...

422
00:31:15.295 --> 00:31:18.321
and waving to their friends.

423
00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:21.333
But the next day... and this is
the thing they don't know...

424
00:31:21.401 --> 00:31:24.598
they could be lying on the slab.

425
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:27.663
It's kind of harsh.

426
00:31:29.276 --> 00:31:31.210
But it's kind of fun too.

427
00:31:36.249 --> 00:31:38.513
- Do you ever...
- What?

428
00:31:41.588 --> 00:31:42.748
Well, you know.

429
00:31:45.091 --> 00:31:47.218
Are you tempted to, like...

430
00:31:48.662 --> 00:31:50.789
wanna fool around with the bodies?

431
00:31:51.965 --> 00:31:54.126
No, I've always wanted to ask.

432
00:31:54.201 --> 00:31:56.135
I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

433
00:31:56.203 --> 00:31:59.639
- People are curious about that.
- If you don't wanna talk about it...

434
00:31:59.706 --> 00:32:03.107
The worst thing that we do is
we take the grotesque bodies...

435
00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:05.906
the really ugly ones...

436
00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:09.574
and we make
harmless jokes about them.

437
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:12.379
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with...

438
00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:15.751
some very good jokes about them...

439
00:32:15.822 --> 00:32:17.983
my father and me.

440
00:32:18.058 --> 00:32:19.992
But, you know, they're dead.

441
00:32:21.895 --> 00:32:24.531
- Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.

442
00:32:24.664 --> 00:32:27.132
Hello, Mrs. Carver.

443
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.998
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

444
00:32:30.069 --> 00:32:32.936
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

445
00:32:33.006 --> 00:32:36.134
Mr. Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

446
00:32:36.209 --> 00:32:38.302
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.

447
00:32:38.378 --> 00:32:41.176
Thanks. Bye.

448
00:32:41.247 --> 00:32:43.807
He wants to kill you, right?

449
00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:47.250
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

450
00:33:10.043 --> 00:33:12.204
Can somebody give me
a hand down here?

451
00:33:12.278 --> 00:33:15.543
- What?
- I need a hand with the wood.

452
00:33:21.054 --> 00:33:22.521
You wanna go help Tucker?

453
00:33:25.959 --> 00:33:28.120
Go help Tucker in the basement.

454
00:33:34.534 --> 00:33:37.833
- Go into the basement...
- I don't wanna go down there.

455
00:33:37.904 --> 00:33:41.670
- Please?
- No way! No way! You!

456
00:33:41.741 --> 00:33:44.005
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

457
00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:51.711
Dad's in there!

458
00:33:59.225 --> 00:34:00.817
Shut up!

459
00:34:14.307 --> 00:34:15.899
Come on!

460
00:34:23.116 --> 00:34:25.016
It's not funny!

461
00:34:25.084 --> 00:34:26.676
Get back here!

462
00:34:31.024 --> 00:34:33.754
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

463
00:34:33.826 --> 00:34:37.455
There's six of'em,
so those could hold anybody.

464
00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:48.131
- I forgot.
- What?

465
00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:53.706
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

466
00:34:59.752 --> 00:35:01.344
I'm sorry.

467
00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:05.849
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

468
00:35:13.199 --> 00:35:16.100
- No, Arnie! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

469
00:35:16.169 --> 00:35:17.466
No, you're not!

470
00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:21.366
Not again!

471
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:24.001
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

472
00:35:24.077 --> 00:35:25.544
Get down!

473
00:35:28.314 --> 00:35:31.943
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

474
00:35:32.018 --> 00:35:34.248
I wanna go up there!

475
00:35:41.494 --> 00:35:43.086
We're going home.

476
00:35:44.597 --> 00:35:46.622
- Stop!
- Ellen, no!

477
00:35:46.699 --> 00:35:49.031
Stop it!
I told you, don't touch him.

478
00:35:49.102 --> 00:35:51.093
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!

479
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:54.606
I don't care.
Just get out of here!

480
00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:56.904
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

481
00:35:58.878 --> 00:36:00.812
Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

482
00:36:03.116 --> 00:36:05.584
What does Gilbert say?

483
00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:08.085
If anybody ever hits you...

484
00:36:08.154 --> 00:36:11.021
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

485
00:36:15.762 --> 00:36:19.755
You're gonna tell me, and then
I'm gonna take care of it for you.

486
00:36:19.832 --> 00:36:21.766
And why will I take care of it?

487
00:36:24.604 --> 00:36:27.129
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

488
00:36:27.206 --> 00:36:29.470
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

489
00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:34.636
You wanna pick out some candy?

490
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.114
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

491
00:36:43.189 --> 00:36:45.851
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

492
00:36:45.925 --> 00:36:48.826
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

493
00:36:48.895 --> 00:36:50.829
Are you listening to me?

494
00:36:54.767 --> 00:36:55.893
Mine.

495
00:36:55.968 --> 00:36:59.404
And you.
You have to stay here.

496
00:36:59.472 --> 00:37:02.771
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

497
00:37:02.842 --> 00:37:06.869
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

498
00:37:06.946 --> 00:37:08.937
We're not going anywhere.

499
00:37:32.038 --> 00:37:33.801
Where are you going?

500
00:38:39.105 --> 00:38:42.409
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

501
00:38:57.657 --> 00:38:59.591
- Look. Come here.
- What?

502
00:38:59.659 --> 00:39:02.423
It's a praying mantis.

503
00:39:02.495 --> 00:39:06.397
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

504
00:39:06.466 --> 00:39:08.525
and she'll bite off his head...

505
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:11.069
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

506
00:39:11.137 --> 00:39:13.298
And then when they're done...

507
00:39:13.373 --> 00:39:15.398
she'll eat him.

508
00:39:15.475 --> 00:39:17.409
She'll eat the rest of him.

509
00:39:18.645 --> 00:39:23.014
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

510
00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:28.214
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

511
00:39:32.425 --> 00:39:35.258
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

512
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.864
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able...

513
00:39:38.932 --> 00:39:41.799
to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

514
00:39:41.868 --> 00:39:43.836
Have you ever been to Colorado?

515
00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:45.768
No, ma'am.

516
00:39:45.839 --> 00:39:47.739
It must be wonderful.

517
00:39:47.807 --> 00:39:49.832
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...

518
00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:52.400
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

519
00:39:52.479 --> 00:39:55.243
This place
is as good a place as any.

520
00:39:55.315 --> 00:39:57.613
Think so?

521
00:39:57.684 --> 00:39:59.174
She should know.

522
00:40:00.019 --> 00:40:02.681
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

523
00:40:02.755 --> 00:40:04.689
Places I didn't even know existed.

524
00:40:04.757 --> 00:40:07.954
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

525
00:40:09.996 --> 00:40:14.365
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

526
00:40:14.434 --> 00:40:16.698
Why doesn't matter.

527
00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:20.364
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

528
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.567
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

529
00:40:25.879 --> 00:40:29.076
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

530
00:40:29.148 --> 00:40:31.116
Isn't she beautiful?

531
00:40:36.756 --> 00:40:40.283
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

532
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.828
Yeah, I noticed that.

533
00:40:42.896 --> 00:40:47.230
I'm not into that...
that whole external beauty thing.

534
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.736
- 'Cause it doesn't last.
- Right.

535
00:40:50.803 --> 00:40:54.239
Eventually, your face
is gonna get wrinkly...

536
00:40:54.307 --> 00:40:57.902
you'll get gray hair,
your boobs might sag.

537
00:40:57.977 --> 00:41:00.275
You know? So what?

538
00:41:00.346 --> 00:41:03.338
It's what you do
that really matters.

539
00:41:03.416 --> 00:41:05.976
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

540
00:41:06.052 --> 00:41:08.145
So what do you wanna do?

541
00:41:09.956 --> 00:41:12.754
I don't know. There's not
so much to do here, really.

542
00:41:14.494 --> 00:41:19.295
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing people do here.

543
00:41:23.603 --> 00:41:25.662
Thank you.

544
00:41:25.738 --> 00:41:27.672
It was nice meeting you.

545
00:41:29.943 --> 00:41:31.001
Be nice.

546
00:41:46.192 --> 00:41:49.286
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

547
00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.391
We want the big one!

548
00:41:52.465 --> 00:41:55.025
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

549
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:58.161
We want the big one!

550
00:42:00.139 --> 00:42:02.198
- Let's go.
- Get us the big one!

551
00:42:02.275 --> 00:42:05.244
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.

552
00:42:05.311 --> 00:42:07.836
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

553
00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:11.849
It's changing.

554
00:42:11.918 --> 00:42:14.386
That's what's wild about the sunset.

555
00:42:14.454 --> 00:42:18.948
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

556
00:42:24.998 --> 00:42:27.364
I love the sky.

557
00:42:27.433 --> 00:42:31.494
It's so limitless.

558
00:42:32.639 --> 00:42:35.437
It is big.
It's very big.

559
00:42:35.508 --> 00:42:37.408
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

560
00:42:37.477 --> 00:42:39.274
That word "big" is so small.

561
00:42:39.345 --> 00:42:42.872
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

562
00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:45.383
to describe the sky.

563
00:42:49.956 --> 00:42:51.617
What?

564
00:42:53.292 --> 00:42:56.125
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

565
00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.358
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

566
00:43:00.433 --> 00:43:03.300
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

567
00:43:07.707 --> 00:43:10.835
I could come back.
I mean, I can come back and...

568
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.435
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll be here then?

569
00:43:13.513 --> 00:43:15.606
Yeah. I'll just sit here.

570
00:43:15.682 --> 00:43:17.741
All right, I'll be back
in a little bit.

571
00:43:23.423 --> 00:43:25.357
Hey, buddy. Come on.
We gotta go.

572
00:43:29.696 --> 00:43:32.290
Where's the duck?
I can't see the duck anywhere.

573
00:43:32.365 --> 00:43:35.596
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

574
00:43:35.668 --> 00:43:39.126
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- I don't have time for this.

575
00:43:39.205 --> 00:43:41.503
Lift up. Okay, good.

576
00:43:41.574 --> 00:43:44.702
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

577
00:43:44.777 --> 00:43:47.245
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

578
00:43:47.313 --> 00:43:49.543
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.

579
00:43:49.615 --> 00:43:52.675
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

580
00:43:54.454 --> 00:43:56.752
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

581
00:43:56.823 --> 00:43:58.882
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

582
00:43:58.958 --> 00:44:01.791
Take this, wash everything.

583
00:44:01.861 --> 00:44:05.991
Your towels are there,
and your robe is there.

584
00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:09.592
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right.

585
00:44:09.669 --> 00:44:11.796
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

586
00:44:14.173 --> 00:44:17.165
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

587
00:44:17.243 --> 00:44:19.575
- The sunset.
- Really?

588
00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:22.170
It was beautiful.

589
00:44:22.248 --> 00:44:23.840
Oh, well.

590
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.814
I'd like to see where you live.

591
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:32.448
No, you wouldn't.

592
00:44:32.525 --> 00:44:34.789
Let's go see where you live.

593
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:36.453
Come on.

594
00:44:43.435 --> 00:44:45.699
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

595
00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:49.705
I go back and forth between them...

596
00:44:49.775 --> 00:44:51.709
'cause they're always moving.

597
00:44:52.778 --> 00:44:55.975
But it's good.
It's my life.

598
00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:01.945
We don't really move.

599
00:45:02.021 --> 00:45:03.955
I mean, we'd like to, but...

600
00:45:05.824 --> 00:45:08.486
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

601
00:45:09.728 --> 00:45:12.322
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

602
00:45:12.398 --> 00:45:14.764
She's pretty much wedged in.

603
00:45:14.833 --> 00:45:18.166
- What do you mean?
- That's it.

604
00:45:18.237 --> 00:45:19.499
That's the house.

605
00:45:22.374 --> 00:45:24.467
It's really amazing.

606
00:45:24.543 --> 00:45:27.603
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

607
00:45:29.348 --> 00:45:31.578
the girth of what's inside of it.

608
00:45:36.922 --> 00:45:39.220
I don't know.

609
00:45:39.291 --> 00:45:42.260
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

610
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.799
That's her.
That's my mom.

611
00:45:52.905 --> 00:45:54.839
What about your dad?

612
00:45:55.974 --> 00:45:59.273
Some other day.
Some other day.

613
00:46:12.725 --> 00:46:15.319
I had a nice time tonight.

614
00:46:17.129 --> 00:46:19.393
I know.

615
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:24.492
- Good night.
- Good night.

616
00:47:13.652 --> 00:47:15.677
Come on.
I'm sorry. Come on.

617
00:47:18.757 --> 00:47:20.748
Here. You're okay.

618
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:26.859
Come on. Get warm.

619
00:47:26.932 --> 00:47:30.424
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

620
00:47:30.502 --> 00:47:34.199
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

621
00:47:34.273 --> 00:47:37.902
- Would somebody please explain?
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.

622
00:47:37.976 --> 00:47:40.240
I could have "drownded."

623
00:47:43.248 --> 00:47:45.648
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

624
00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:48.709
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths.

625
00:47:51.757 --> 00:47:53.918
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

626
00:47:56.395 --> 00:47:57.589
It's ready.

627
00:47:57.663 --> 00:48:00.154
Where's your head lately?

628
00:48:00.232 --> 00:48:02.996
Where is your head?

629
00:48:04.236 --> 00:48:07.728
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

630
00:48:07.806 --> 00:48:09.899
You gotta do better.

631
00:48:09.975 --> 00:48:12.034
Gotta do better.

632
00:48:14.446 --> 00:48:17.006
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

633
00:48:18.283 --> 00:48:20.308
That's right.

634
00:48:20.385 --> 00:48:24.082
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

635
00:48:24.156 --> 00:48:27.489
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

636
00:48:27.559 --> 00:48:28.992
Here.

637
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.655
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

638
00:48:33.732 --> 00:48:35.324
It sounds urgent.

639
00:48:46.512 --> 00:48:49.310
Get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

640
00:48:49.381 --> 00:48:51.645
Right now. Hurry up.

641
00:48:59.992 --> 00:49:01.254
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

642
00:49:04.463 --> 00:49:07.057
Could you dial that number
over there for me?

643
00:49:07.132 --> 00:49:10.659
- My hands are all...
- Yeah, sure.

644
00:49:10.736 --> 00:49:12.704
- How have you been?
- Good.

645
00:49:12.771 --> 00:49:14.500
I saw you last night.

646
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:18.004
Who's the girl?

647
00:49:19.077 --> 00:49:22.444
- It's ringing.
- Sorry. One sec.

648
00:49:24.249 --> 00:49:25.773
This is good. Taste.

649
00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:28.285
That's good. It's ringing.

650
00:49:28.353 --> 00:49:30.617
One second.

651
00:49:31.723 --> 00:49:34.021
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

652
00:49:40.065 --> 00:49:42.932
- Mr. Carver?
- Who is this?

653
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:44.434
It's Gilbert.

654
00:49:46.838 --> 00:49:49.671
I'd given up on you, Gilbert.

655
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:51.936
- Did you?
- Well, yeah. Can you blame me?

656
00:49:53.378 --> 00:49:56.836
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

657
00:49:56.915 --> 00:49:59.941
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

658
00:50:00.018 --> 00:50:02.282
Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...

659
00:50:02.354 --> 00:50:05.187
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

660
00:50:05.257 --> 00:50:07.623
- Yes.
- Today is your lucky day.

661
00:50:07.693 --> 00:50:10.958
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

662
00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:16.000
Is that a yes?

663
00:50:18.003 --> 00:50:19.334
- Okay.
- All right.

664
00:50:19.404 --> 00:50:21.338
I'm gonna be waiting here for you.

665
00:50:23.942 --> 00:50:27.343
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

666
00:50:27.412 --> 00:50:30.575
Just playing.
Don't you wanna play?

667
00:50:30.649 --> 00:50:32.082
This is crazy.

668
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.948
- I've gotta go.
- You don't have to go.

669
00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.248
Yes, I do.

670
00:50:39.925 --> 00:50:42.393
It's that new girl, isn't it?

671
00:50:42.461 --> 00:50:45.157
It's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

672
00:50:46.298 --> 00:50:49.324
If you walk out that door...

673
00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:51.801
Don't you dare walk out that door.

674
00:51:16.361 --> 00:51:18.226
You look nervous, Gilbert.

675
00:51:19.697 --> 00:51:21.756
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

676
00:51:23.067 --> 00:51:26.195
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

677
00:51:27.906 --> 00:51:30.602
I reviewed your file.

678
00:51:30.675 --> 00:51:32.870
You've got
no major medical insurance.

679
00:51:34.012 --> 00:51:36.742
No catastrophic, no life.

680
00:51:41.185 --> 00:51:42.948
What if something
were to happen to you?

681
00:51:44.989 --> 00:51:47.549
Something unforeseeable?

682
00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:50.219
Something sudden? Random?

683
00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:55.258
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

684
00:51:57.335 --> 00:51:59.599
Do you ever think about your family?

685
00:52:01.239 --> 00:52:04.072
Stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

686
00:52:05.343 --> 00:52:09.404
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

687
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.142
Ken Carver here.

688
00:52:12.216 --> 00:52:14.150
Can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

689
00:52:16.988 --> 00:52:19.582
Please, calm down.
Calm down.

690
00:52:22.827 --> 00:52:24.021
Go on.

691
00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:43.679
Calm... I'm on my way.

692
00:52:49.153 --> 00:52:51.553
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

693
00:52:52.924 --> 00:52:55.290
Damn. Betty's got the car.

694
00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.329
Would you give me a ride?

695
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.380
Oh, my God! Betty!

696
00:53:21.452 --> 00:53:23.613
What the hell's going on here?

697
00:53:23.688 --> 00:53:26.088
Todd? Doug?
What is going on here?

698
00:53:26.157 --> 00:53:28.091
I don't believe this!

699
00:53:30.128 --> 00:53:31.720
Oh, great!

700
00:53:34.432 --> 00:53:36.024
Boys, come on.

701
00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:39.035
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

702
00:53:40.271 --> 00:53:41.738
This is great.

703
00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:46.369
All right.
Everything's okay.

704
00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:52.705
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

705
00:53:52.784 --> 00:53:55.548
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

706
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.521
They're wonderful.

707
00:53:58.589 --> 00:54:01.456
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

708
00:54:01.526 --> 00:54:03.357
They're really good.

709
00:54:03.428 --> 00:54:05.589
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

710
00:54:05.663 --> 00:54:07.528
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies.

711
00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:16.130
I could've had any guy.
Any guy!

712
00:54:16.207 --> 00:54:18.437
But...

713
00:54:18.509 --> 00:54:20.534
I chose you.

714
00:54:21.979 --> 00:54:24.277
I got you a real pool,
for God's sake!

715
00:54:24.348 --> 00:54:26.908
Look! There's water in here!

716
00:54:26.984 --> 00:54:29.475
Come here!
Get over here!

717
00:54:30.855 --> 00:54:32.322
Get inside the pool!

718
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:35.325
Get inside the pool
with your brother!

719
00:54:35.393 --> 00:54:37.156
Why did you?

720
00:54:37.228 --> 00:54:40.857
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

721
00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:46.402
Because...

722
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:48.166
I knew you'd always be there.

723
00:54:50.775 --> 00:54:53.243
Because I knew you'd never leave.

724
00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:56.439
What the hell else
more do you want?

725
00:54:56.514 --> 00:54:59.210
What? For God's sake!

726
00:55:01.753 --> 00:55:05.086
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

727
00:55:06.758 --> 00:55:09.693
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

728
00:55:09.761 --> 00:55:13.697
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

729
00:55:14.298 --> 00:55:17.165
I can't give anymore.
I've given enough already.

730
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.605
I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.

731
00:55:31.682 --> 00:55:32.808
Not yet.

732
00:55:34.786 --> 00:55:37.721
Arthur, in all my life...

733
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:40.849
I'll wonder, where is he?

734
00:55:42.894 --> 00:55:46.057
Just this moment, just now...

735
00:55:47.565 --> 00:55:50.227
what is he looking at?

736
00:55:50.301 --> 00:55:51.791
What is he thinking?

737
00:55:51.869 --> 00:55:54.269
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

738
00:55:57.275 --> 00:56:00.403
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

739
00:56:00.478 --> 00:56:02.742
Just let him stink.

740
00:56:02.814 --> 00:56:05.977
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.

741
00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:08.746
You know Mr. Carver?

742
00:56:09.887 --> 00:56:11.479
Well, he's dead.

743
00:56:39.183 --> 00:56:41.743
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

744
00:56:43.788 --> 00:56:46.052
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

745
00:56:49.227 --> 00:56:51.127
A kiddie pool.
I don't get it.

746
00:56:52.997 --> 00:56:54.794
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

747
00:56:54.866 --> 00:56:56.595
- Yeah.
- He "drownded."

748
00:57:07.178 --> 00:57:10.011
He had the cardiac arrest.

749
00:57:10.081 --> 00:57:11.878
His head bent forward...

750
00:57:11.949 --> 00:57:13.746
his knees buckled...

751
00:57:13.818 --> 00:57:16.286
and then he just fell...

752
00:57:17.355 --> 00:57:19.118
face forward into the pool.

753
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.125
When she found him,
he was already dead.

754
00:57:22.193 --> 00:57:24.423
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

755
00:57:24.495 --> 00:57:28.363
No, I know it.
I saw the body.

756
00:57:28.433 --> 00:57:30.765
I prepared it.
I know exactly what...

757
00:57:30.835 --> 00:57:35.363
I would have seen if there was
any kind of struggle.

758
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.967
- It was murder.
- No.

759
00:57:39.043 --> 00:57:41.307
What do you think?
What do you think?

760
00:57:41.379 --> 00:57:43.404
I don't know.

761
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:45.278
It's possible.

762
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:48.876
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

763
00:57:48.953 --> 00:57:51.888
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...

764
00:57:51.956 --> 00:57:54.584
She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.

765
00:57:54.659 --> 00:57:56.786
If you saw somebody laying...

766
00:57:56.861 --> 00:57:59.887
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

767
00:57:59.964 --> 00:58:03.092
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

768
00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:05.692
- which he wasn't doing...
- You don't know that!

769
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.570
Well, it was an extreme
"post-cardial" infarction.

770
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.700
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?

771
00:58:12.777 --> 00:58:15.746
Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

772
00:58:15.813 --> 00:58:18.145
It's that girl!

773
00:58:19.584 --> 00:58:21.518
Wait a minute.

774
00:58:21.586 --> 00:58:23.417
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

775
00:58:23.488 --> 00:58:27.822
We're talkin' about pushin' along
something rolling in that direction.

776
00:58:27.892 --> 00:58:30.292
Please, play with me over there.

777
00:58:30.361 --> 00:58:33.387
Come on.
Let's play over there.

778
00:58:33.464 --> 00:58:35.125
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

779
00:58:35.199 --> 00:58:37.394
- Will you play?
- Okay, we'll play.

780
00:58:37.468 --> 00:58:40.164
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!

781
00:58:40.238 --> 00:58:43.105
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah.

782
00:58:48.246 --> 00:58:49.713
So, that's it.

783
00:58:50.915 --> 00:58:53.713
Yeah, I guess so.

784
00:58:56.053 --> 00:58:57.520
The magic part.

785
00:59:03.361 --> 00:59:04.953
The magic part?

786
00:59:15.206 --> 00:59:17.333
- Could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.

787
00:59:17.408 --> 00:59:21.037
- Thanks.
- Can we go play now?

788
00:59:21.112 --> 00:59:24.411
What are we gonna play?
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?

789
00:59:27.752 --> 00:59:29.811
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

790
00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:39.721
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

791
00:59:41.799 --> 00:59:43.232
Try it.

792
00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:53.802
I don't know.

793
00:59:53.878 --> 00:59:57.211
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't...

794
00:59:57.281 --> 00:59:59.181
It's a mystery.

795
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.741
- Listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

796
01:00:02.753 --> 01:00:05.153
Come play with me in the water.

797
01:00:05.223 --> 01:00:09.159
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

798
01:00:09.227 --> 01:00:11.718
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

799
01:00:11.796 --> 01:00:13.957
No, I want you to come in with me.

800
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.095
Say "Where's Arnie?"

801
01:00:18.169 --> 01:00:19.693
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

802
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:22.102
Where's Arnie?

803
01:00:22.173 --> 01:00:26.633
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

804
01:00:26.711 --> 01:00:30.112
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

805
01:00:30.181 --> 01:00:33.344
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

806
01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:36.011
Don't even try it, 'cause he's
had a scare with water...

807
01:00:36.087 --> 01:00:37.645
and he won't come in.

808
01:00:38.556 --> 01:00:40.786
I'm not comin' in the water.

809
01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:43.993
You wanna come in the water?

810
01:00:46.264 --> 01:00:47.856
Why not?

811
01:00:50.568 --> 01:00:52.729
Are you scared
to come in the water?

812
01:00:52.803 --> 01:00:55.567
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

813
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:59.201
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

814
01:00:59.277 --> 01:01:02.041
Are you scared, Gilbert?

815
01:01:02.113 --> 01:01:05.549
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

816
01:01:05.616 --> 01:01:08.744
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

817
01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:10.980
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

818
01:01:14.558 --> 01:01:16.025
A little more.

819
01:01:18.296 --> 01:01:20.059
Do you wanna see this?

820
01:01:21.799 --> 01:01:23.323
You want this, right?

821
01:01:23.401 --> 01:01:25.096
Huh? You happy?

822
01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:35.405
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

823
01:01:39.016 --> 01:01:40.950
Okay, what do you want?

824
01:01:42.353 --> 01:01:43.877
- Faster!
- Okay.

825
01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:46.684
I want a new thing.

826
01:01:48.559 --> 01:01:51.722
House. I want a new house
for the family.

827
01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.365
I want Mama...

828
01:01:57.435 --> 01:01:59.562
to take aerobics classes.

829
01:02:00.838 --> 01:02:02.305
I want Ellen to grow up.

830
01:02:03.474 --> 01:02:06.807
I want a new brain for Arnie.

831
01:02:06.877 --> 01:02:08.367
I want...

832
01:02:09.613 --> 01:02:11.877
What do you want for you?

833
01:02:11.949 --> 01:02:14.008
Just for you.

834
01:02:15.519 --> 01:02:17.749
I want to be a good person.

835
01:02:21.859 --> 01:02:24.327
I can't do this.

836
01:02:24.395 --> 01:02:27.592
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

837
01:02:37.341 --> 01:02:39.935
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

838
01:02:57.027 --> 01:02:58.654
Shit.

839
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:15.947
Come on.

840
01:03:20.918 --> 01:03:23.910
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

841
01:03:23.988 --> 01:03:26.582
All right, here we go.
There you go.

842
01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:28.818
It's all right, Jerry.
I got him. I got him.

843
01:03:28.893 --> 01:03:31.259
We're takin' him in.

844
01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:33.297
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise.

845
01:03:33.364 --> 01:03:35.332
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

846
01:03:35.399 --> 01:03:37.264
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

847
01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:41.294
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights! Play the siren!

848
01:03:41.372 --> 01:03:43.135
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

849
01:03:43.207 --> 01:03:45.175
Way to go, Gilbert.

850
01:03:47.578 --> 01:03:49.478
Jerry, listen. You're gonna
have to take it easy on him.

851
01:03:49.547 --> 01:03:51.879
- We'll take care of him.
- You gotta keep an eye on him.

852
01:03:51.949 --> 01:03:53.382
All right.

853
01:03:55.953 --> 01:04:00.185
Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

854
01:04:11.936 --> 01:04:13.403
I know, Sheriff.

855
01:04:16.707 --> 01:04:18.140
I know that, Sheriff.

856
01:04:19.844 --> 01:04:22.836
Okay. Asshole!

857
01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:27.912
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson, proving a point.

858
01:04:27.985 --> 01:04:29.782
Yeah. That's right.

859
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:34.423
Get my coat.

860
01:04:35.993 --> 01:04:37.085
What?

861
01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.758
Get my coat.

862
01:04:42.967 --> 01:04:44.298
Get it!

863
01:04:56.347 --> 01:04:57.609
Let's go.

864
01:05:10.461 --> 01:05:12.326
Well, at least
he's in a safe place.

865
01:05:12.396 --> 01:05:14.591
- At least someone's watching him.
- Ellen, shut up.

866
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.514
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

867
01:05:32.983 --> 01:05:34.974
Mama, let Gilbert handle this.

868
01:05:43.761 --> 01:05:46.662
- Come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

869
01:05:46.730 --> 01:05:49.665
- You gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

870
01:05:51.735 --> 01:05:54.169
I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...

871
01:05:54.238 --> 01:05:58.334
Look, no one's gonna do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

872
01:06:20.197 --> 01:06:22.665
I've come for my son.

873
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:27.259
Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?

874
01:06:27.338 --> 01:06:29.499
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

875
01:06:31.142 --> 01:06:35.306
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

876
01:06:35.379 --> 01:06:39.008
My son! Give me my son!

877
01:06:50.294 --> 01:06:52.524
Come on. You're goin' home.

878
01:06:54.965 --> 01:06:58.366
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

879
01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:03.370
Don't disappear like that anymore.
Promise me.

880
01:07:06.143 --> 01:07:08.839
You're free, baby.
Let's go home.

881
01:07:17.888 --> 01:07:19.321
Look!

882
01:07:31.835 --> 01:07:34.429
That's why she needs a cane.

883
01:08:00.331 --> 01:08:02.595
Look at her!

884
01:08:21.885 --> 01:08:26.322
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

885
01:08:28.826 --> 01:08:31.090
Flash the lights.

886
01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:40.760
Look at me!

887
01:08:41.739 --> 01:08:45.607
I'm hiding!
Say "Where's Arnie?"

888
01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:47.974
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

889
01:08:52.316 --> 01:08:54.284
Gilbert, come find me.

890
01:08:55.753 --> 01:08:57.550
Where's Arnie?

891
01:09:02.293 --> 01:09:03.885
That's my mom in there.

892
01:09:03.961 --> 01:09:06.395
My mama.

893
01:09:06.463 --> 01:09:08.727
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

894
01:09:10.034 --> 01:09:12.298
Come play with me.

895
01:09:28.318 --> 01:09:31.116
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

896
01:09:32.456 --> 01:09:34.185
You know that, right?

897
01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.094
I'd like to meet her.

898
01:09:39.162 --> 01:09:40.754
No, you wouldn't.

899
01:09:44.868 --> 01:09:46.802
Okay, where do you go next?

900
01:10:24.674 --> 01:10:27.108
I would like to meet your mom.

901
01:10:35.052 --> 01:10:39.045
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

902
01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:43.218
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

903
01:10:44.294 --> 01:10:47.422
and we commit his body
to the ground.

904
01:10:47.497 --> 01:10:50.125
Earth to earth...

905
01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.227
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

906
01:10:55.305 --> 01:10:58.001
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

907
01:10:58.075 --> 01:11:00.805
The Lord make His face
shine on him...

908
01:11:00.877 --> 01:11:02.970
and be gracious to him.

909
01:11:03.046 --> 01:11:05.981
The Lord look upon him
with favor...

910
01:11:06.049 --> 01:11:07.983
and give him peace.

911
01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:13.985
Lord Jesus, by Your death
You took away the sting of death.

912
01:11:14.057 --> 01:11:17.083
Grant to us, Your servants,
so to follow in faith...

913
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.685
for You have led the way...

914
01:11:19.763 --> 01:11:21.856
that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in You...

915
01:11:21.932 --> 01:11:26.096
- Look here!
- great in Your likeness...

916
01:11:26.169 --> 01:11:30.230
the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

917
01:11:30.307 --> 01:11:33.640
The great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the covenant...

918
01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:35.974
It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!

919
01:11:36.046 --> 01:11:38.514
make you perfect in
every good work to do His will...

920
01:11:38.582 --> 01:11:42.575
working in you that which is
well pleasing in His sight...

921
01:11:42.652 --> 01:11:45.678
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, amen.

922
01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:55.223
Boys, you can have
anything you want.

923
01:11:55.298 --> 01:11:58.734
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want.

924
01:11:59.736 --> 01:12:03.035
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

925
01:12:03.106 --> 01:12:05.074
You like gum?

926
01:12:05.142 --> 01:12:07.667
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

927
01:12:07.744 --> 01:12:11.236
Here, take this.
You can have it.

928
01:12:13.783 --> 01:12:17.082
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St. Louis.

929
01:12:17.154 --> 01:12:19.850
I can't stay in that house.

930
01:12:22.626 --> 01:12:25.026
I really am sorry about your...

931
01:12:27.664 --> 01:12:30.565
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

932
01:12:35.138 --> 01:12:37.072
Everybody thinks I killed him.

933
01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:41.008
Do you?

934
01:12:52.856 --> 01:12:54.448
I miss him...

935
01:12:58.461 --> 01:13:00.326
and I don't.

936
01:13:00.397 --> 01:13:02.262
I miss him, and I don't.

937
01:13:17.414 --> 01:13:21.874
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

938
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:26.387
Oh, I'll probably just...

939
01:13:26.456 --> 01:13:28.253
You haven't thought about it.

940
01:13:29.693 --> 01:13:32.924
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

941
01:13:33.697 --> 01:13:36.598
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

942
01:13:37.334 --> 01:13:39.461
- Mommy?
- Coming in a minute, honey.

943
01:13:45.942 --> 01:13:47.933
Concerning my boys?

944
01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:52.675
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

945
01:14:08.331 --> 01:14:10.822
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...

946
01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:13.266
for my boys to be like you.

947
01:14:30.854 --> 01:14:32.515
He's all yours.

948
01:14:43.933 --> 01:14:45.696
Are you gonna miss her?

949
01:14:48.204 --> 01:14:50.172
Yeah.

950
01:14:54.144 --> 01:14:55.406
Good.

951
01:15:56.839 --> 01:15:58.397
Damn it!

952
01:16:24.467 --> 01:16:25.798
So...

953
01:16:25.868 --> 01:16:27.961
what do you think?

954
01:16:30.273 --> 01:16:32.468
- Wow.
- Right?

955
01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:35.511
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.

956
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:41.139
Real milk in there.

957
01:16:42.351 --> 01:16:43.978
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

958
01:16:55.798 --> 01:16:57.629
Congratulations!
This looks great!

959
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.895
- Yeah, thanks a million.
- What?

960
01:16:59.969 --> 01:17:02.529
You tryin' to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin their appetites.

961
01:17:04.006 --> 01:17:06.839
Mike, right? You wanna come
to my party tomorrow?

962
01:17:06.909 --> 01:17:09.503
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

963
01:17:09.579 --> 01:17:12.980
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

964
01:17:14.817 --> 01:17:17.786
How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.

965
01:17:18.487 --> 01:17:22.480
This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...

966
01:17:22.558 --> 01:17:27.825
for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.

967
01:17:27.897 --> 01:17:30.161
We at Burger Barn are committed...

968
01:17:30.232 --> 01:17:33.963
to a very special relationship with
you, one that will last and last.

969
01:17:35.371 --> 01:17:38.807
In a time when so many things
are falling apart...

970
01:17:38.874 --> 01:17:42.173
Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...

971
01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:45.645
a new breath of life.

972
01:17:45.715 --> 01:17:49.981
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...

973
01:17:50.052 --> 01:17:53.419
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

974
01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:18.738
Come on!

975
01:18:35.798 --> 01:18:39.598
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

976
01:18:49.145 --> 01:18:50.737
So, I'm invited.

977
01:19:03.359 --> 01:19:05.293
Do you not want me to go?

978
01:19:06.595 --> 01:19:09.564
I mean, go if you want.

979
01:19:13.169 --> 01:19:16.468
Oh, so is this how you want it?

980
01:19:22.344 --> 01:19:23.777
I have to go.

981
01:19:27.383 --> 01:19:29.783
Take care, okay?

982
01:19:38.227 --> 01:19:40.024
Good-bye, Arnie.

983
01:19:44.467 --> 01:19:47.630
- Come on, let's get that bath.
- No. No!

984
01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:53.967
Guys!

985
01:19:55.678 --> 01:19:57.976
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

986
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:03.852
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

987
01:20:06.422 --> 01:20:09.391
- Arnie, damn it!
- Oh, no!

988
01:20:12.595 --> 01:20:14.062
Oh, God.

989
01:20:15.131 --> 01:20:18.828
I can't make another one.
I can't.

990
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:23.805
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

991
01:20:39.989 --> 01:20:41.923
Attention, Foodland shoppers.

992
01:20:41.991 --> 01:20:45.586
Remember every day this week
is a double coupon day.

993
01:20:55.137 --> 01:20:58.766
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

994
01:20:58.841 --> 01:21:01.105
My sister called in
an order for Grape.

995
01:21:01.177 --> 01:21:03.372
Oh, yeah. It's all set.

996
01:21:05.247 --> 01:21:10.116
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

997
01:21:27.136 --> 01:21:29.434
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

998
01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:32.599
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's in that box?

999
01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:34.609
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'll kill you.

1000
01:21:34.677 --> 01:21:36.611
I can't believe you.

1001
01:21:36.679 --> 01:21:40.479
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1002
01:21:40.549 --> 01:21:43.177
You'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1003
01:21:43.252 --> 01:21:45.243
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1004
01:21:46.889 --> 01:21:50.757
It's Arnie's 18th birthday. You've
waited to do this for a long time.

1005
01:21:50.826 --> 01:21:53.886
Wasn't it you who wanted to have
this huge party in the first place?

1006
01:21:53.963 --> 01:21:56.431
I didn't want to.

1007
01:21:57.733 --> 01:22:00.702
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1008
01:22:00.769 --> 01:22:03.465
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.

1009
01:22:03.539 --> 01:22:05.131
- Look, he's eating the cake!
- Shit!

1010
01:22:05.207 --> 01:22:07.675
- That's it. Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.

1011
01:22:08.677 --> 01:22:10.645
Now what are we gonna do?

1012
01:22:14.683 --> 01:22:16.617
Come here. Come here!

1013
01:22:16.685 --> 01:22:20.246
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1014
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:23.950
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1015
01:22:32.001 --> 01:22:34.603
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1016
01:22:41.376 --> 01:22:44.675
Get in that bath.
Get them fucking clothes off.

1017
01:22:44.746 --> 01:22:46.441
Come on.

1018
01:22:49.618 --> 01:22:51.609
Don't move. Don't move!

1019
01:22:51.686 --> 01:22:53.483
Gilbert, stop!

1020
01:23:24.419 --> 01:23:26.353
What did you do?

1021
01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.520
What is goin' on?

1022
01:24:02.991 --> 01:24:05.687
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1023
01:25:56.871 --> 01:25:59.965
- We should call his mother.
- No, no. It's okay.

1024
01:26:00.041 --> 01:26:02.339
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1025
01:26:02.410 --> 01:26:04.207
It's really okay. Yeah.

1026
01:26:12.987 --> 01:26:15.217
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1027
01:26:18.126 --> 01:26:20.287
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1028
01:26:39.514 --> 01:26:41.106
Come on, Arnie.

1029
01:26:50.225 --> 01:26:54.457
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
- Come on, Arnie. You can do it.

1030
01:26:56.598 --> 01:27:00.432
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1031
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:03.231
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1032
01:27:03.304 --> 01:27:05.499
Row, row, row your boat

1033
01:27:05.573 --> 01:27:08.064
Gently down the stream

1034
01:27:10.678 --> 01:27:12.043
You did it!

1035
01:27:13.214 --> 01:27:16.411
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1036
01:27:22.457 --> 01:27:25.324
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1037
01:27:25.393 --> 01:27:28.089
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1038
01:27:28.162 --> 01:27:29.823
Take care.

1039
01:27:29.898 --> 01:27:33.061
I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

1040
01:27:33.134 --> 01:27:35.796
No, you just got clean.

1041
01:27:44.746 --> 01:27:47.647
So he's clean now, you guys.

1042
01:27:47.715 --> 01:27:49.649
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1043
01:27:49.717 --> 01:27:52.083
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1044
01:27:52.153 --> 01:27:54.587
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

1045
01:27:54.656 --> 01:27:56.248
You're welcome.

1046
01:28:23.718 --> 01:28:25.310
I hit him.

1047
01:28:26.955 --> 01:28:29.116
I hit him so hard, I...

1048
01:28:32.327 --> 01:28:34.852
He's gonna be okay.

1049
01:28:37.065 --> 01:28:39.727
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1050
01:28:49.644 --> 01:28:53.671
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1051
01:29:24.279 --> 01:29:26.213
I got nowhere to go.

1052
01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:35.750
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1053
01:29:37.159 --> 01:29:39.093
So it's your fault?

1054
01:29:40.162 --> 01:29:44.098
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1055
01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:47.101
He didn't say good-bye.
He just...

1056
01:29:48.637 --> 01:29:52.403
One day, all of a sudden...

1057
01:29:54.843 --> 01:29:56.435
he was gone.

1058
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.378
He was just hangin' there.

1059
01:30:02.317 --> 01:30:04.808
That's when it all started.

1060
01:30:06.588 --> 01:30:08.715
She used to be so pretty.

1061
01:30:09.725 --> 01:30:14.526
She was so pretty
and so fun.

1062
01:30:16.798 --> 01:30:19.494
So you think it's his fault?

1063
01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:28.968
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1064
01:30:29.044 --> 01:30:30.978
He was just sort of there.

1065
01:30:31.914 --> 01:30:35.350
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

1066
01:30:35.417 --> 01:30:38.580
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

1067
01:30:38.654 --> 01:30:40.884
I don't know... get mad.

1068
01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:45.521
But nothin'.

1069
01:30:47.663 --> 01:30:50.325
Just like he was already dead.

1070
01:30:54.636 --> 01:30:56.866
I used to know a guy like that.

1071
01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:33.096
It's Arnie's birthday.

1072
01:32:34.169 --> 01:32:35.932
I need to go home.

1073
01:33:01.797 --> 01:33:03.389
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1074
01:33:03.465 --> 01:33:05.057
Give my regards to your mother.

1075
01:33:07.169 --> 01:33:10.070
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1076
01:33:10.138 --> 01:33:11.162
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1077
01:33:11.239 --> 01:33:12.604
He's alive.

1078
01:33:35.831 --> 01:33:37.128
Where's Arnie?

1079
01:33:43.672 --> 01:33:44.934
Please, Amy.

1080
01:33:48.743 --> 01:33:50.176
Is he okay?

1081
01:33:53.949 --> 01:33:56.042
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1082
01:34:01.223 --> 01:34:02.656
Where is he?

1083
01:34:11.399 --> 01:34:13.697
I wonder where he could be.

1084
01:34:27.282 --> 01:34:28.874
Have you seen Arnie?

1085
01:34:30.685 --> 01:34:33.313
No, I thought he was with you.

1086
01:34:51.173 --> 01:34:53.107
Anybody seen Arnie?

1087
01:34:54.576 --> 01:34:56.168
Where's my brother?

1088
01:35:16.665 --> 01:35:18.565
Come here.

1089
01:35:18.633 --> 01:35:20.534
You scared me, buddy.

1090
01:35:21.968 --> 01:35:23.401
You scared Gilbert.

1091
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:26.064
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1092
01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:29.074
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1093
01:35:45.458 --> 01:35:47.119
Come here.

1094
01:35:47.861 --> 01:35:49.488
Who's got you?

1095
01:36:06.279 --> 01:36:08.008
You better talk to Mama.

1096
01:36:30.737 --> 01:36:32.898
What you did was...

1097
01:36:37.243 --> 01:36:39.177
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1098
01:36:46.653 --> 01:36:49.281
And then disappearing like that?

1099
01:36:50.857 --> 01:36:52.586
I hate that.

1100
01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.987
You know how I hate that.

1101
01:36:59.633 --> 01:37:02.295
You walked out,
and I thought...

1102
01:37:02.369 --> 01:37:04.530
I can't take another.

1103
01:37:07.641 --> 01:37:09.575
But you came back, Gilbert.

1104
01:37:11.277 --> 01:37:12.301
Why?

1105
01:37:14.047 --> 01:37:15.810
Why did you?

1106
01:37:23.923 --> 01:37:25.857
I don't know, Mama.

1107
01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:29.189
I'm here now.

1108
01:37:35.101 --> 01:37:37.433
Yes, you are.

1109
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:40.630
You came back for the party.

1110
01:37:49.282 --> 01:37:53.218
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1111
01:37:56.089 --> 01:37:58.819
I know what a burden I am.

1112
01:37:58.892 --> 01:38:00.484
Don't say that.

1113
01:38:02.162 --> 01:38:03.652
I know it.

1114
01:38:04.731 --> 01:38:07.564
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1115
01:38:08.935 --> 01:38:10.698
No, I'm not.

1116
01:38:20.914 --> 01:38:25.476
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1117
01:38:27.253 --> 01:38:30.916
I never wanted to be a joke.

1118
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:32.651
You're no joke, Mama.

1119
01:38:32.726 --> 01:38:35.718
- I never wanted to be.
- You're no joke.

1120
01:38:39.733 --> 01:38:43.760
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1121
01:38:49.909 --> 01:38:51.171
Hurry! Hurry!

1122
01:38:51.244 --> 01:38:55.180
You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

1123
01:38:55.248 --> 01:38:57.045
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.

1124
01:38:59.219 --> 01:39:00.743
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

1125
01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.811
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1126
01:39:02.889 --> 01:39:06.450
You see how the porch is
slanted right here?

1127
01:39:06.526 --> 01:39:10.155
I mean, this is a serious problem.
We need to get up underneath here...

1128
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:13.427
First of all, we need to fill this
in so no more water collects here.

1129
01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:15.491
And then we'll probably...
What?

1130
01:39:23.977 --> 01:39:26.468
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1131
01:39:28.782 --> 01:39:31.444
- You ready?
- For what?

1132
01:39:32.452 --> 01:39:35.387
I want you to come meet somebody.

1133
01:39:41.427 --> 01:39:44.760
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

1134
01:39:44.831 --> 01:39:46.423
Thank you!

1135
01:39:57.877 --> 01:39:59.572
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1136
01:40:03.983 --> 01:40:06.315
Please?

1137
01:40:07.387 --> 01:40:09.287
Just this once, for me?

1138
01:40:09.355 --> 01:40:11.585
Gilbert, it's okay.
We can do it later.

1139
01:40:11.658 --> 01:40:14.593
No. This is what I want.

1140
01:40:14.661 --> 01:40:17.027
Do it for me, please?

1141
01:40:17.096 --> 01:40:20.088
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1142
01:40:20.166 --> 01:40:22.066
I'm not gonna
hurt you anymore, Mama.

1143
01:40:23.036 --> 01:40:25.561
I promise.

1144
01:40:26.573 --> 01:40:27.835
Please.

1145
01:40:46.125 --> 01:40:47.717
Mama, this is Becky.

1146
01:40:58.905 --> 01:41:01.430
I haven't always been like this.

1147
01:41:03.576 --> 01:41:06.443
I haven't always been like this.

1148
01:41:13.686 --> 01:41:15.984
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1149
01:41:16.055 --> 01:41:18.489
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle.

1150
01:41:18.558 --> 01:41:20.958
I can believe that.
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1151
01:41:22.795 --> 01:41:26.390
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Arnie. You take care.

1152
01:41:35.608 --> 01:41:37.735
I had a really nice time.

1153
01:41:40.146 --> 01:41:41.738
I know.

1154
01:41:51.257 --> 01:41:54.954
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you," Gilbert.

1155
01:41:55.027 --> 01:41:57.188
Say "Thank you."

1156
01:42:06.639 --> 01:42:08.607
Thank you.

1157
01:42:16.549 --> 01:42:20.508
- Good-bye.
- No, it's not good-bye, Arnie.

1158
01:42:20.586 --> 01:42:22.315
It's good night.

1159
01:42:22.388 --> 01:42:25.448
Good night to you, but not me.

1160
01:42:25.524 --> 01:42:27.685
Hey, they're coming!

1161
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:30.820
Bye! Wait!

1162
01:42:57.823 --> 01:42:59.916
Mama, what are you doing?

1163
01:43:55.181 --> 01:43:57.342
You rest, Mama.

1164
01:43:58.818 --> 01:44:00.752
You deserve to rest.

1165
01:44:04.323 --> 01:44:08.282
Get me my birthday boy.
I want my birthday boy.

1166
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.955
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1167
01:44:17.970 --> 01:44:20.438
You're my knight
in shimmering armor.

1168
01:44:20.506 --> 01:44:22.565
Did you know that?

1169
01:44:23.642 --> 01:44:25.667
I think you mean "shining."

1170
01:44:26.645 --> 01:44:30.103
No, "shimmering."

1171
01:44:30.182 --> 01:44:32.514
You shimmer and you glow.

1172
01:44:39.725 --> 01:44:42.489
You rest, okay?

1173
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:44.495
Get some sleep.

1174
01:45:11.323 --> 01:45:13.655
Wake up!

1175
01:45:15.628 --> 01:45:17.562
You're hiding, huh?

1176
01:45:19.932 --> 01:45:21.661
I know that.

1177
01:45:24.637 --> 01:45:26.070
Wake up!

1178
01:45:28.874 --> 01:45:31.900
Mama, wake up!

1179
01:46:05.144 --> 01:46:08.671
Mama, stop it now!

1180
01:46:08.747 --> 01:46:10.908
Stop, Mama!

1181
01:46:14.353 --> 01:46:15.877
Stop it.

1182
01:46:27.933 --> 01:46:29.696
What's wrong?

1183
01:46:29.768 --> 01:46:31.861
What's wrong? Stop it!

1184
01:47:36.436 --> 01:47:38.529
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1185
01:47:39.906 --> 01:47:42.807
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1186
01:47:43.876 --> 01:47:47.277
You may need the National Guard
to move her outta there.

1187
01:47:47.346 --> 01:47:49.280
I'm sorry about that.

1188
01:48:00.593 --> 01:48:03.027
It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1189
01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:09.795
There's gonna be a crowd.

1190
01:48:11.437 --> 01:48:13.928
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1191
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:24.972
She's so beautiful.

1192
01:49:26.045 --> 01:49:27.979
She's no joke.

1193
01:49:38.124 --> 01:49:40.490
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1194
01:50:05.518 --> 01:50:07.850
We're gonna need your help.

1195
01:53:20.545 --> 01:53:23.013
Gilbert, is that them?

1196
01:53:24.682 --> 01:53:27.173
- No, not yet.
- When are they gonna come?

1197
01:53:27.252 --> 01:53:28.844
Pretty soon.

1198
01:53:31.489 --> 01:53:34.151
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1199
01:53:37.929 --> 01:53:41.160
Gilbert, look there!

1200
01:53:41.232 --> 01:53:43.928
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1201
01:53:44.002 --> 01:53:45.526
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1202
01:53:45.603 --> 01:53:48.367
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1203
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.305
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go too, and I said...

1204
01:53:50.375 --> 01:53:53.401
"Well, we can go anywhere...

1205
01:53:53.478 --> 01:53:55.446
if we want.

1206
01:53:56.581 --> 01:53:59.516
- We can go anywhere. "
- Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

1207
01:53:59.584 --> 01:54:02.712
Yep. She's comin'.

1208
01:54:05.056 --> 01:54:07.388
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

1209
01:54:35.286 --> 01:54:39.746
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
