1
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.711
Five,

2
00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:19.590
nine, ten, eleven,

3
00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:22.249
- twelve, thirteen, nineteen, seventeen,
- Arnie.

4
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.053
- fifteen, seventeen.
- Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:24.804 --> 00:00:27.483
I don't,
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.228
You want some corn?

7
00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:33.540
- I want, I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:40.445
Good?

9
00:00:42.828 --> 00:00:44.831
Not good corn.

10
00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:49.989
Gilbert?

11
00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.575
Are they gonna come soon?

12
00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:55.671
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

13
00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.968
- Pretty soon.
- I want them to come.

14
00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:02.972
- You wanna go home?
- No.

15
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:04.809
I wanna see 'em.

16
00:01:05.392 --> 00:01:06.311
Okay.

17
00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:09.498
They're gonna come soon, huh?

18
00:01:10.282 --> 00:01:12.410
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

19
00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:14.105
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?

20
00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:15.849
- Yep.
- Okay.

21
00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.996
Gilbert! That's them, huh?
Gilbert, look, it's them!

22
00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:31.002
Look! They're coming here!

23
00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:35.942
Over here!

24
00:01:40.173 --> 00:01:42.726
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

25
00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.502
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

26
00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:51.989
- Arnie, get back here!
- Honk your horn!

27
00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:55.110
- My brother Arnie's about to turn 18.
- Arnie!

28
00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.829
- My family's planning a big party for him.
- Arnie, come on!

29
00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:02.102
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

30
00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:05.949
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

31
00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.208
God, Arnie. You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon

32
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.818
I ain't gonna be able
to carry you no more.

33
00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:14.829
No.

34
00:02:15.212 --> 00:02:18.048
- You know, you're getting littler, Gilbert.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.969
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

36
00:02:21.052 --> 00:02:24.867
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
You're shrinking.

37
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.511
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

38
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.268
Endora.

39
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.063
Endora's where we are.

40
00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:43.766
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

41
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:47.840
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens,

42
00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:50.143
and nothing much ever will.

43
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:54.666
Lamson's Grocery's where I work.

44
00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.386
And miles out of town on the interstate,
there's Foodland

45
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940
where everyone else shops.

46
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.647
This is where I live with my family.
My dad built the house

47
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.833
and it's my job
to keep up the repairs.

48
00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:15.076
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

49
00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.830
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying,

50
00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:20.750
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

51
00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.268
Some days you want him to live,

52
00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:37.514
some days you don't.

53
00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:40.442
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

54
00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.264
I killed him, Gilbert.
I killed him.

55
00:03:47.278 --> 00:03:48.830
I know, buddy.
I know.

56
00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:57.316
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

57
00:03:58.176 --> 00:04:01.655
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley

58
00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.041
until it burned down last year.

59
00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:08.631
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

60
00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:10.488
She got her braces off,
and for days now

61
00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.089
she's been walking around,
going "Ooh. Ahh."

62
00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:15.455
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

63
00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.604
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

64
00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:27.957
And then there's Mama,
who in her day

65
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.160
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

66
00:04:30.243 --> 00:04:32.948
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago,

67
00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:34.625
Mama's had her hands full.

68
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.670
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

69
00:04:39.272 --> 00:04:41.642
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

70
00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:46.083
I'm Gilbert.

71
00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:48.878
Gilbert Grape.

72
00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.419
Sunshine?
Where's my sunshine?

73
00:04:56.463 --> 00:04:58.023
I don't know, Mama.

74
00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:00.718
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

75
00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:07.960
Gilbert, get him down from there.

76
00:05:08.303 --> 00:05:10.856
- Arnie? Let's go.
- Hurry.

77
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.804
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

78
00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:19.634
- I thought he was with you.
- No. No.

79
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.490
- I wonder where he is.
- Gee, I don't know.

80
00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:25.719
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

81
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.413
He's in the tree.

82
00:05:27.596 --> 00:05:31.235
Ellen, he is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

83
00:05:31.318 --> 00:05:33.096
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

84
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.525
Yeah, that's right.

85
00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:37.903
Whoa!

86
00:05:39.887 --> 00:05:42.341
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

87
00:05:44.502 --> 00:05:47.539
- Wait, wait. I was up there, Gilbert!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

88
00:05:47.572 --> 00:05:49.249
I was right up there.

89
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:39.502
Can I help you with anything?

90
00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:43.540
- No.
- Thank you, and goodbye.

91
00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:49.690
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

92
00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:52.727
- Is something goin' on at Foodland?
- Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

93
00:06:52.752 --> 00:06:55.438
I don't shop there.
I'd rather die.

94
00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:59.268
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

95
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.831
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

96
00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:10.293
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

97
00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:12.187
Am I right?

98
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.956
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

99
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.929
It's just a phase.
People will come back here, believe me.

100
00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:22.407
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

101
00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:27.089
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

102
00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:36.244
- Can I have these two, Gilbert?
- No, just one.

103
00:07:36.267 --> 00:07:38.047
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

104
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.466
Say "Thank you."

105
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.060
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All righty. See you tomorrow.

106
00:07:42.085 --> 00:07:45.865
Gilbert? That was Mrs Carver
needing a delivery.

107
00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:47.218
Could you?

108
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:53.525
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Hello.

109
00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:58.499
- Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.

110
00:07:58.512 --> 00:08:01.995
- Yeah, we don't want to.
- Go play.

111
00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:03.331
Okay.

112
00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:08.019
Hey! Hey!

113
00:08:08.044 --> 00:08:10.839
Arnie, get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

114
00:08:10.863 --> 00:08:14.345
Okay. I was counting.

115
00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:42.266
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

116
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:54.149
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on! Look!

117
00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:57.813
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

118
00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:04.247
The, uh,
The ice cream's gonna melt,

119
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:05.875
soon.

120
00:09:08.836 --> 00:09:12.299
You're right.
It is melting.

121
00:09:45.809 --> 00:09:48.782
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

122
00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:51.710
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my!

123
00:09:51.794 --> 00:09:54.637
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.

124
00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:58.880
- Come on up here. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.

125
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:00.521
- I don't either.
- You don't wanna do it?

126
00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:02.809
I want a pool.

127
00:10:03.392 --> 00:10:04.978
- You want a pool?
- Yeah.

128
00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.279
- Yeah, we want a pool.
- Come on. Come on up here.

129
00:10:06.462 --> 00:10:07.532
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

130
00:10:14.432 --> 00:10:17.404
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

131
00:10:17.987 --> 00:10:20.431
Oh. Oh.

132
00:10:22.476 --> 00:10:26.131
Gilbert, come here for a second.

133
00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:35.994
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Really, uh...

134
00:10:36.018 --> 00:10:39.567
Oh, no. No, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

135
00:10:42.603 --> 00:10:44.481
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

136
00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:46.383
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Bye.

137
00:10:46.467 --> 00:10:47.611
Gilbert?

138
00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:53.225
Come by my office.
We need to talk.

139
00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:55.523
Okay.

140
00:10:57.107 --> 00:10:58.268
Arnie?

141
00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:14.314
Okay, son, it's a little dangerous up there.
Come on down.

142
00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:16.100
Arnie, get down!

143
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:17.901
Come on, son.
We've had enough fun for one day.

144
00:11:17.984 --> 00:11:21.097
- Come on down.
- Hey!

145
00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.334
Hey! Hey!

146
00:11:24.919 --> 00:11:26.471
Wanna go up there!

147
00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:30.034
- Son?
- Yeah?

148
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:32.537
- Come on down.
- No!

149
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:35.091
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

150
00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:38.554
Son, come on down.

151
00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:40.940
I'm gonna go up there!

152
00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:45.823
- Arnie? Arnie. Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

153
00:11:45.906 --> 00:11:47.641
Hi!

154
00:11:49.026 --> 00:11:51.804
Okay, son.
Come on down.

155
00:11:52.724 --> 00:11:54.709
I'm gonna go up here!

156
00:11:54.892 --> 00:11:59.406
- Come on, son.
- I'm goin' higherer than before!

157
00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.487
- I'm goin' high!
- It's gonna be getting dark soon.

158
00:12:02.488 --> 00:12:03.788
- Come on down.
- Hey.

159
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.267
Hey, Bob.
Yeah, look it. Here we go again.

160
00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:09.965
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburetors

161
00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.024
and I can tell
without gettin' into it

162
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.478
that that is a complicated unit.

163
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:19.134
I, now, I understand. I can do it
myself, but I need the part.

164
00:12:19.157 --> 00:12:20.553
Look, let me show you.

165
00:12:20.936 --> 00:12:22.972
See, it's this
little guy right here.

166
00:12:23.255 --> 00:12:25.468
See, the needle valve
is worn down.

167
00:12:25.593 --> 00:12:30.847
- And I need a new one. Can we order it?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I can order it.

168
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.385
About how long do you think
that would take?

169
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.675
- Probably a week.
- A week?

170
00:12:35.776 --> 00:12:37.076
Don't make us come get you.

171
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.961
I, you don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

172
00:12:42.723 --> 00:12:43.859
Arnie?

173
00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:49.198
Whoa! I'm not gonna fall!
Whoops!

174
00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:50.827
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

175
00:12:52.428 --> 00:12:53.831
Hey!

176
00:12:54.956 --> 00:12:57.059
My shoe done fell off.

177
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:02.016
My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.

178
00:13:03.402 --> 00:13:06.189
I know a boy
whose name is Arnie

179
00:13:06.514 --> 00:13:10.261
He's about to turn 18
and have a big party

180
00:13:10.544 --> 00:13:13.073
I know a boy
whose name is Arnie

181
00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:16.380
Come on down, buddy.
Come on.

182
00:13:24.723 --> 00:13:27.576
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

183
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.725
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

184
00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:37.957
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

185
00:13:38.882 --> 00:13:42.003
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

186
00:13:42.028 --> 00:13:43.997
Boom, boom, boom, boom

187
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:47.303
Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom

188
00:13:47.386 --> 00:13:49.282
- Good boy.
- Easy does it, now.

189
00:13:49.283 --> 00:13:50.883
Come on down, buddy.

190
00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:52.519
- All right!
- Come on down.

191
00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:54.913
Come on!

192
00:14:04.484 --> 00:14:07.746
Here. Here you go, Arnie.
Thanks a lot, Jerry. I'm really sorry.

193
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:10.625
Good.
Good boy. Good boy.

194
00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:13.362
Now, I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

195
00:14:13.386 --> 00:14:15.143
Son, we hear this every time.

196
00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:17.714
Then after a couple of days,
he's right back up there again.

197
00:14:17.727 --> 00:14:21.331
Yeah, but this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

198
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:23.952
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

199
00:14:24.719 --> 00:14:27.323
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

200
00:14:27.407 --> 00:14:28.409
Let's go.

201
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:34.374
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.

202
00:14:34.387 --> 00:14:37.377
- Hey! Don't touch him.
- Whoa! Nice try!

203
00:14:37.403 --> 00:14:39.666
Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?

204
00:14:39.733 --> 00:14:42.586
- Get out of here.
- Hey, could you help me out later

205
00:14:42.587 --> 00:14:44.087
- Yeah.
- with the fridge?

206
00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.666
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

207
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.452
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

208
00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:51.846
- All right. I have to get my tools.
- Hi.

209
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.352
I'll see you, I'll just come by later.
Hi. You be careful, all right, Arnie?

210
00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.839
Okay.

211
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:04.355
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

212
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.661
Okay. I disappeared.

213
00:15:07.744 --> 00:15:10.497
I disappeared on Mom like that.

214
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.910
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

215
00:15:12.943 --> 00:15:15.646
- Gilbert, will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

216
00:15:15.669 --> 00:15:17.675
- Good boy.
- Disappear like that.

217
00:15:17.676 --> 00:15:18.876
Good boy.

218
00:15:19.469 --> 00:15:20.628
The food.

219
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.169
Are we ready to talk about the party?

220
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.070
- Sure.
- I'm ready.

221
00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:30.901
Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Get this: purple, orange and green.

222
00:15:31.384 --> 00:15:33.094
- Sounds good.
- Theme colors, okay?

223
00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:37.174
- That sounds pretty good.
- I'm doing the food, the cake.

224
00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:38.428
Okay.

225
00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:41.298
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

226
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:43.893
- And Mama, you can supervise everything.
- Mm-hmm.

227
00:15:43.918 --> 00:15:45.854
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.

228
00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:48.392
- Sounds good.
- What about me?

229
00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:51.644
You are the guest of honor.
How about that?

230
00:15:51.678 --> 00:15:54.418
Gilbert, what about me?
My party! It's my party!

231
00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.450
- What about me?
- You just show up, buddy. That's your job.

232
00:15:56.534 --> 00:15:59.139
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

233
00:15:59.322 --> 00:16:01.558
All you have to do is turn 18.

234
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:04.295
- You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
- Huh?

235
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.364
You're the only one
without anything to do.

236
00:16:06.848 --> 00:16:09.252
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

237
00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.446
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

238
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.402
I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.

239
00:16:14.603 --> 00:16:15.303
Ellen,

240
00:16:15.327 --> 00:16:17.553
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

241
00:16:17.563 --> 00:16:18.612
Stop it, Ellen. Can it.

242
00:16:18.613 --> 00:16:20.613
- Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!

243
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:21.514
No.

244
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.569
Please can't we just do something
as a family?

245
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:25.448
- It's no fair, mama.
- Can I please be excused?

246
00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:27.849
We're planning this as a family.

247
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.750
- It's my party though!
- Is that too much to ask?

248
00:16:29.866 --> 00:16:34.823
So it's gonna be an exact copy of the one,
the original they built in Boone.

249
00:16:34.982 --> 00:16:37.312
- Really?
- Which is no big deal, Gilbert,

250
00:16:37.342 --> 00:16:40.600
'cause they're all,
all Burger Barns are built identical.

251
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.838
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

252
00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:45.239
I mean, it's so efficient.
It's amazing.

253
00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:49.555
In a matter of a couple days, there
can be a whole new restaurant there.

254
00:16:50.274 --> 00:16:53.053
So I was driving past
the building site today.

255
00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:56.811
You know, it's goin' up right next to,
right down the road from Foodland.

256
00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:59.150
- Right.
- The general manager was there.

257
00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.587
So I says, "Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

258
00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:05.265
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good. I mean,

259
00:17:05.266 --> 00:17:08.066
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers

260
00:17:08.685 --> 00:17:11.004
saltin' some fries.

261
00:17:11.503 --> 00:17:15.940
You never know. It could be the best
thing that ever happened to me.

262
00:17:17.341 --> 00:17:19.441
- Hey! Get,
- What's the matter?

263
00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:21.578
Get out of here! God!

264
00:17:21.637 --> 00:17:25.016
I saw her!
I saw her, I saw her!

265
00:17:25.456 --> 00:17:28.153
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

266
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.092
- You know what you did.
- Oh.

267
00:17:30.093 --> 00:17:31.693
That's your mother in there.

268
00:17:32.451 --> 00:17:35.210
- You mother.
- I know.

269
00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.447
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

270
00:17:39.487 --> 00:17:41.726
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

271
00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:42.727
Come on.

272
00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:46.828
Gilbert, run now.
Run!

273
00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:51.029
Hey! Bye-bye, Mama.

274
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:52.930
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, you guys.

275
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.531
- Move, baby.
- Gilbert, you're shrinking.

276
00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:58.832
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

277
00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:15.388
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

278
00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:19.007
- You gotta go to sleep, okay?
- Okay.

279
00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:22.783
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye. It's good night.

280
00:18:23.484 --> 00:18:25.784
- Yeah.
- Goodbye

281
00:18:26.323 --> 00:18:29.080
is for when you're going away,
and we're not going anywhere, are we?

282
00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.959
I know that.

283
00:18:31.558 --> 00:18:33.657
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

284
00:18:33.677 --> 00:18:37.396
We're not going anywhere!

285
00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:40.135
- Goodbye!
- Arnie.

286
00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:50.844
You gotta work later?

287
00:18:50.845 --> 00:18:51.945
- Hi, boys.
- Yeah, I do.

288
00:18:52.024 --> 00:18:53.645
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi there, ladies.

289
00:18:53.646 --> 00:18:54.846
I gotta come back.

290
00:18:55.024 --> 00:18:57.764
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.

291
00:18:58.144 --> 00:19:01.186
Come on, man.
She's not all that big, Gilbert.

292
00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:01.987
What?

293
00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:06.306
Listen, I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

294
00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:07.866
A little bit bigger?

295
00:19:08.245 --> 00:19:10.425
Look, all I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.

296
00:19:10.426 --> 00:19:11.626
Tucker, she's a whale.

297
00:19:11.706 --> 00:19:13.126
Well, take her out for walk
once in a while.

298
00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:15.105
- Take her out for a jog.
- Get her out of the house.

299
00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:18.306
Hey Bobby.
Hey Bobby.

300
00:19:18.726 --> 00:19:20.126
Give her a chance.
That's all I'm sayin'.

301
00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.307
I know.

302
00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:24.987
- How's business?
- Not good. Hey!

303
00:19:25.067 --> 00:19:26.727
Nobody's dying.

304
00:19:27.107 --> 00:19:30.707
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

305
00:19:30.788 --> 00:19:32.527
- I mean, this is not,
- That's good.

306
00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:35.629
That's a good thing for you to do,
to have that happen.

307
00:19:35.709 --> 00:19:37.908
- If you guys would give it a chance,
- I, I,

308
00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:40.989
I just was saying that it wasn't something
that I should be doing for myself.

309
00:19:41.009 --> 00:19:44.129
Look, they use canola oil, okay?
You know what canola oil is?

310
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:44.830
- You probably don't.
- No.

311
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.629
They probably don't even sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

312
00:19:46.709 --> 00:19:48.710
- No.
- It's cutting edge.

313
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:51.830
- It creates a crispier french fry and,
- Well, that's,

314
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:53.670
and a more unique product.

315
00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:57.070
And Burger Barn, Forget Wendy's,
forget Burger King, forget McDonald's.

316
00:19:57.149 --> 00:20:00.151
That's, like, old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

317
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:02.389
I mean, I, I could really
stand behind it. There's

318
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.312
It's an innovative place. You know,
they created the salad bar

319
00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:09.110
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

320
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.311
- Yeah.
- They came up with that.

321
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:15.152
Fifteen different toppings for each salad,
and two different kinds of lettuce.

322
00:20:15.232 --> 00:20:17.552
And it's, you know,
it's all that you care to eat.

323
00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:19.312
- I mean,
- Yeah.

324
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:23.672
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager,

325
00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:26.513
or you can go from clerk
to cashier captain,

326
00:20:26.593 --> 00:20:28.073
to assistant manager.

327
00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:31.953
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to, uh, manager,

328
00:20:32.033 --> 00:20:34.433
and then regional manager
and then...

329
00:20:42.674 --> 00:20:44.995
Look at the little fellas.

330
00:20:45.975 --> 00:20:47.774
You mean my hoppers.

331
00:20:48.155 --> 00:20:49.894
Let's try this.

332
00:20:49.975 --> 00:20:51.795
For my friend.

333
00:20:54.415 --> 00:20:56.496
There you go, my boy.

334
00:20:56.776 --> 00:20:58.276
What do you say, Arnie?

335
00:20:59.456 --> 00:21:02.476
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

336
00:21:06.178 --> 00:21:07.256
Gilbert.

337
00:21:11.637 --> 00:21:13.536
This Thursday.

338
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:18.218
It's our anniversary.

339
00:21:19.438 --> 00:21:20.458
Okay.

340
00:21:23.418 --> 00:21:24.759
Hello.

341
00:21:49.021 --> 00:21:50.041
Gilbert.

342
00:21:51.821 --> 00:21:54.061
I'll need a delivery later.

343
00:22:01.802 --> 00:22:03.162
Have a nice day.

344
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:06.783
Gilbert?

345
00:22:08.903 --> 00:22:09.922
Gilbert?

346
00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.723
He's behind the chips.

347
00:22:15.943 --> 00:22:17.943
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

348
00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:20.564
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

349
00:22:22.024 --> 00:22:23.203
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:24.883 --> 00:22:26.984
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

351
00:22:28.164 --> 00:22:30.044
I'll do it, Gilbert.
I'll do it.

352
00:22:35.184 --> 00:22:37.445
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

353
00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:41.486
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.

354
00:22:41.487 --> 00:22:43.287
I did it by myself.

355
00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:47.266
Yeah.
Look at that.

356
00:23:00.666 --> 00:23:05.167
- I could go at any time.
- Shh. Arnie. No.

357
00:23:05.247 --> 00:23:06.648
Any time.

358
00:23:08.168 --> 00:23:10.688
Excuse me. Where to?

359
00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:12.888
Oh, just keep going straight.

360
00:23:14.248 --> 00:23:15.529
All right.

361
00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:20.409
My mom, my mom wants me
to become, become 18.

362
00:23:20.488 --> 00:23:23.729
And I'm having a big,
a big party, huh, Gilbert?

363
00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:26.070
- Yep.
- When is that party coming?

364
00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:26.971
Six days.

365
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.069
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

366
00:23:30.889 --> 00:23:34.170
- I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Arnie.

367
00:23:34.251 --> 00:23:37.131
- Don't be rude.
- Oh, it's okay.

368
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.750
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

369
00:23:47.892 --> 00:23:51.011
- I-I got the groceries!
- All right. Be careful with them.

370
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:53.773
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

371
00:23:54.853 --> 00:23:56.912
- Uh-oh, Gilbert.
- No, Arnie.

372
00:23:57.293 --> 00:23:59.612
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.

373
00:23:59.692 --> 00:24:01.653
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

374
00:24:01.733 --> 00:24:04.213
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, I'm really, I'm really sorry.

375
00:24:04.293 --> 00:24:07.615
- This is...
- It's okay.

376
00:24:07.694 --> 00:24:10.473
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

377
00:24:11.054 --> 00:24:14.494
Are you sorry? No.

378
00:24:14.615 --> 00:24:16.894
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

379
00:24:16.973 --> 00:24:18.494
Don't be sorry.

380
00:24:19.174 --> 00:24:21.375
I'm not sorry.

381
00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:27.155
So I think if we're gonna
have people come that early,

382
00:24:27.156 --> 00:24:28.756
we should have some appetizers.

383
00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:32.065
Ooh, yeah, that'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

384
00:24:32.095 --> 00:24:35.135
And you put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

385
00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:37.296
- Well, I was thinking,
- I want hot dogs, Mom.

386
00:24:37.297 --> 00:24:38.097
- How about pretzels?
- Be quiet.

387
00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:41.616
You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers that they make with the...

388
00:24:41.695 --> 00:24:44.317
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can and you wrap them

389
00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:46.937
with little pieces of bacon
and you put a toothpick through 'em.

390
00:24:46.957 --> 00:24:50.477
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.

391
00:24:50.558 --> 00:24:53.618
But the bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

392
00:24:53.738 --> 00:24:55.857
- Yes, it will.
- And nobody wants greasy,

393
00:24:55.858 --> 00:24:56.558
I want hot dogs!

394
00:24:56.567 --> 00:24:58.538
- No, you, you soak 'em,
- floppy bacon.

395
00:24:58.618 --> 00:25:01.898
- Mama, I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

396
00:25:01.977 --> 00:25:03.579
- Mama.
- I promise, we're gonna have hot dogs.

397
00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.780
What, I want hot dogs.

398
00:25:04.858 --> 00:25:06.398
- The thing about
- We're gonna have hot dogs.

399
00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:07.899
- every party that I've been to,
- Ellen.

400
00:25:07.978 --> 00:25:08.979
- is that...
- Ellen?

401
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:09.780
What?

402
00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:13.261
- Could you not talk with your mouth full?
- Excuse me?

403
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:15.299
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

404
00:25:17.579 --> 00:25:20.540
- Oh. Okay, Dad.
- Ellen.

405
00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.660
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

406
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.041
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

407
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:26.701
- Stop it, you guys.
- Don't start.

408
00:25:26.702 --> 00:25:28.002
Dad's dead, Ellen.

409
00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.620
- Gilbert!
- Gilbert!

410
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:30.621
I can't believe you said that!

411
00:25:30.701 --> 00:25:33.541
- Shut up!
- Dad's dead!

412
00:25:33.622 --> 00:25:35.501
- Arnie.
- Dad's dead!

413
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:38.302
- Arnie, shh. Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

414
00:25:38.382 --> 00:25:41.841
- It's okay. Stop it now.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

415
00:25:41.922 --> 00:25:44.662
- Arnie, stop it!
- Calm down, Mama. Don't get upset.

416
00:25:44.663 --> 00:25:46.363
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Make him stop.

417
00:25:46.383 --> 00:25:47.342
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, shut up!

418
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.664
- Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!
- You're crazy, you're crazy, Arnie!

419
00:25:49.743 --> 00:25:51.062
- Arnie...
- Stop it.

420
00:25:51.143 --> 00:25:53.822
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Arnie, listen to me!

421
00:25:53.903 --> 00:25:56.283
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Just calm down!

422
00:25:56.284 --> 00:25:57.184
Stop it!

423
00:25:57.263 --> 00:25:59.784
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dad's dead!

424
00:25:59.864 --> 00:26:01.903
- Arnie, that's enough!
- Stop it!

425
00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:04.865
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

426
00:26:04.944 --> 00:26:06.884
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Right now!

427
00:26:06.963 --> 00:26:09.704
- Dad's dead!
- I said, stop it right now!

428
00:26:09.824 --> 00:26:11.544
Amy. Amy.

429
00:26:12.565 --> 00:26:14.786
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves,

430
00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:17.825
and the space
between 'em here is, should,

431
00:26:17.905 --> 00:26:20.625
They're right now, it's at two feet,
and this should be 16 inches.

432
00:26:20.705 --> 00:26:22.946
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here.

433
00:26:23.025 --> 00:26:26.706
See this here? Flat flooring?
I mean, flat flooring's like...

434
00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.566
Once the wood gets old, you're
just gonna fall right through it.

435
00:26:29.847 --> 00:26:32.286
Yeah, I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

436
00:26:33.727 --> 00:26:36.867
Hey, Gilbert, why did, why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by?

437
00:26:36.947 --> 00:26:39.227
- Tucker!
- What?

438
00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:42.428
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Sorry.

439
00:26:52.788 --> 00:26:55.330
She's coming.
Hey, she's coming.

440
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.191
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.

441
00:27:15.272 --> 00:27:18.551
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

442
00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:21.432
- Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow with the wood.
- Great.

443
00:27:21.512 --> 00:27:23.831
Just, let's keep it quiet.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

444
00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:25.991
- What?
- Burger Barn. I'm in.

445
00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:28.552
- I got the call.
- Oh, oh. Good.

446
00:27:28.631 --> 00:27:31.992
It's not too late, you know.
Good night.

447
00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:35.872
I think she's asleep.

448
00:27:35.873 --> 00:27:38.573
<i>Let's say that you wanna
slice down zucchini squash</i>

449
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:40.933
<i>with the electric food dehydrator.
Look at this.</i>

450
00:27:41.713 --> 00:27:45.073
<i>- Wonderful.
- Perfect slices each and every time.</i>

451
00:27:45.153 --> 00:27:46.473
<i>- Is that nice?
- Marvelous.</i>

452
00:27:46.554 --> 00:27:48.994
<i>Of course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well</i>

453
00:27:49.073 --> 00:27:50.794
<i>- Okay.
- Taking corn off the cob.</i>

454
00:27:50.874 --> 00:27:53.314
<i>Look at this. We'll just turn
the dial down a little bit</i>

455
00:27:58.354 --> 00:28:01.435
<i>freezed corn, and sit there
for hours with a knife.</i>

456
00:28:01.514 --> 00:28:03.935
<i>- Literally hours cutting your corn up.
- Unbelievable.</i>

457
00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:06.235
<i>Of course, for un</i>

458
00:28:08.476 --> 00:28:09.656
<i>Right now, you get the hundred</i>

459
00:28:09.657 --> 00:28:11.757
Gilbert, what are you doing?

460
00:28:11.935 --> 00:28:14.276
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

461
00:28:14.555 --> 00:28:16.176
Jeez.

462
00:28:19.116 --> 00:28:21.878
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

463
00:28:21.957 --> 00:28:23.877
I made up that bed for you.

464
00:28:25.678 --> 00:28:27.298
What for?

465
00:28:28.277 --> 00:28:30.238
Well, just in case
you wanted a change.

466
00:28:31.517 --> 00:28:34.038
I'm happy right where I am.

467
00:28:34.117 --> 00:28:36.758
- You sure?
- Yeah.

468
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.379
Here you go.

469
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.280
Here you go, Mama.

470
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.240
Thanks, kids.

471
00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:01.640
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

472
00:29:09.521 --> 00:29:12.322
- Another ball!
- I took her delivery, we talked a little bit.

473
00:29:12.402 --> 00:29:14.241
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

474
00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:15.722
What's she doing here?

475
00:29:16.002 --> 00:29:17.882
She, I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

476
00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:20.002
I think their car broke down
or something.

477
00:29:20.083 --> 00:29:22.202
Come on. You, I can see it
in your face that you're...

478
00:29:22.322 --> 00:29:25.483
Can we just not talk about this now?
Can we just change the subject?

479
00:29:25.564 --> 00:29:29.643
- Do you understand?
- We want a pool.

480
00:29:32.144 --> 00:29:36.124
- Okay. You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

481
00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:39.124
- Look at those guys out there.
- Gilbert.

482
00:29:39.204 --> 00:29:42.084
They're laughing, they're all happy,

483
00:29:42.165 --> 00:29:44.804
and waving to their friends.

484
00:29:44.925 --> 00:29:47.925
But the next day, and this is
the thing that they don't know,

485
00:29:48.104 --> 00:29:51.706
they could be lying on the slab.

486
00:29:51.785 --> 00:29:54.365
It's kind of, uh, harsh.

487
00:29:55.666 --> 00:29:57.886
But it's kind of fun too.

488
00:30:02.346 --> 00:30:04.907
- Do you ever, um...
- What?

489
00:30:07.466 --> 00:30:08.867
Well, you know.

490
00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:13.126
- Thank you.
- Are you tempted to, like,

491
00:30:14.267 --> 00:30:16.308
wanna fool around with the bodies?

492
00:30:16.388 --> 00:30:18.406
- Oh, Tucker, come on.
- No, I wanted to ask.

493
00:30:18.407 --> 00:30:20.407
- I've always wanted to ask.
- That's all right.

494
00:30:20.487 --> 00:30:21.568
I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

495
00:30:21.648 --> 00:30:22.769
People are very curious about that.

496
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.970
Because, I mean
if you don't wanna talk about it,

497
00:30:25.048 --> 00:30:28.409
The worst thing that we do is we take
the bodies, the grotesque ones,

498
00:30:28.489 --> 00:30:31.090
the really, really ugly ones,

499
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.569
and we make, make jokes about them,
you know, harmless jokes.

500
00:30:34.689 --> 00:30:37.290
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with some,

501
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:42.370
some very good, good jokes
about them, my father and me.

502
00:30:42.449 --> 00:30:46.210
But, but, you know, they're dead.
And, uh...

503
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.890
You know, nobody can see that.
Nobody hears anything.

504
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:49.241
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Mrs Carver.

505
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.252
- Hello, Mrs Carver.
- Hi.

506
00:30:51.332 --> 00:30:54.171
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

507
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:56.471
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

508
00:30:57.092 --> 00:31:00.091
Mr Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

509
00:31:00.171 --> 00:31:02.171
- How's she doing?
- Fine. She's fine.

510
00:31:02.252 --> 00:31:04.411
Thanks. Bye.

511
00:31:05.391 --> 00:31:07.412
He wants,
he wants to kill you, right?

512
00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:10.633
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

513
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:32.534
Hey!
Gilbert!

514
00:31:32.615 --> 00:31:35.335
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand down here?

515
00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:36.155
What?

516
00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:38.256
Can somebody give me a hand
with the wood?

517
00:31:40.175 --> 00:31:42.536
- Hey, Arnie.
- Huh?

518
00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:45.077
You wanna go help Tucker?

519
00:31:47.156 --> 00:31:49.936
Arnie, go help Tucker in the basement.

520
00:31:53.437 --> 00:31:57.337
Arnie, why don't you
go into the basement?

521
00:31:57.357 --> 00:31:59.737
- I don't wanna go down there, Gilbert.
- Please?

522
00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:03.417
No way! No way! No way!
You!

523
00:32:03.437 --> 00:32:05.759
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

524
00:32:07.179 --> 00:32:09.958
Gilbert?
Hey!

525
00:32:09.978 --> 00:32:11.878
Dad's in there!

526
00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:17.879
Dad's in there!

527
00:32:19.059 --> 00:32:21.499
Arnie, shut up!
Arnie!

528
00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:28.660
Shut up! Shut up!

529
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.180
Come on! Arnie.

530
00:32:39.121 --> 00:32:40.182
Arnie!

531
00:32:42.301 --> 00:32:43.661
It's not funny!

532
00:32:44.281 --> 00:32:45.561
Get back here!

533
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:52.663
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

534
00:32:52.742 --> 00:32:56.462
You know, there's six of 'em,
so, you know, those could hold anybody.

535
00:33:04.343 --> 00:33:07.303
- I, I forgot.
- What?

536
00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:12.024
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

537
00:33:15.383 --> 00:33:16.304
Yep.

538
00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:19.746
I'm, I'm sorry.

539
00:33:20.925 --> 00:33:23.865
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

540
00:33:30.745 --> 00:33:33.326
- No, Arnie! No! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

541
00:33:33.346 --> 00:33:35.186
Arnie! No, you're not!

542
00:33:35.666 --> 00:33:38.447
Arnie! Not again!

543
00:33:38.527 --> 00:33:39.766
- Arnie!
- I wanna go up there!

544
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:41.067
Get down. Get down.

545
00:33:41.226 --> 00:33:43.067
Get down!

546
00:33:44.927 --> 00:33:48.707
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

547
00:33:48.788 --> 00:33:50.868
I wanna go up there!

548
00:33:52.768 --> 00:33:55.767
No!
We're going home!

549
00:33:57.568 --> 00:34:00.487
We're going home.
Come on.

550
00:34:00.568 --> 00:34:02.788
- Stop!
- Ellen, no! Stop it!

551
00:34:02.867 --> 00:34:04.949
- Stop it!
- I told you, don't touch him.

552
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:06.547
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't ever touch him again.

553
00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:07.848
- He was climbing again!
- I don't care.

554
00:34:07.928 --> 00:34:09.789
Just get out of here.
Just get out of here!

555
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:12.989
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

556
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:16.590
Let me see. Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

557
00:34:18.631 --> 00:34:20.649
What does Gilbert say?

558
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.151
If anybody ever hits you

559
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.050
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

560
00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:27.271
Arnie?

561
00:34:30.451 --> 00:34:34.351
You're gonna tell me, and then I'm
gonna take care of it for you, right?

562
00:34:34.432 --> 00:34:36.092
And why will I take care of it?

563
00:34:37.271 --> 00:34:39.072
- Gilbert.
- Hmm?

564
00:34:39.153 --> 00:34:41.392
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

565
00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:43.973
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

566
00:34:45.133 --> 00:34:48.633
Okay. You wanna pick out some candy?

567
00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:56.454
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

568
00:34:56.733 --> 00:34:59.294
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

569
00:34:59.373 --> 00:35:01.534
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

570
00:35:02.213 --> 00:35:04.235
Are you listening to me?

571
00:35:07.853 --> 00:35:10.375
- Mine.
- And you.

572
00:35:10.455 --> 00:35:12.294
- Huh?
- You have to stay here.

573
00:35:12.374 --> 00:35:16.016
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

574
00:35:16.095 --> 00:35:19.416
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

575
00:35:19.576 --> 00:35:24.097
We're not going anywhere, Gilbert.
We're not going anywhere, you know?

576
00:35:24.177 --> 00:35:28.256
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.

577
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:30.458
We're not going,
we're not going anywhere.

578
00:35:30.538 --> 00:35:35.537
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere!

579
00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:37.496
Gilbert, we're not going anywhere.

580
00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:42.298
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere.

581
00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.297
Where are you going?

582
00:36:45.664 --> 00:36:46.784
Hey!

583
00:36:47.864 --> 00:36:51.324
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

584
00:36:51.885 --> 00:36:52.984
Hey!

585
00:36:55.625 --> 00:36:57.584
Hi, Gilbert.

586
00:37:05.426 --> 00:37:07.546
- Oh, look. Come here.
- What?

587
00:37:07.626 --> 00:37:10.266
- It's a praying mantis.
- Oh.

588
00:37:10.345 --> 00:37:14.106
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female

589
00:37:14.186 --> 00:37:16.146
and she'll bite off his head

590
00:37:16.225 --> 00:37:18.547
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

591
00:37:18.667 --> 00:37:20.708
And then when they're done

592
00:37:20.787 --> 00:37:22.746
she'll eat him.

593
00:37:22.826 --> 00:37:24.748
She'll eat the rest of him.

594
00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:30.028
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

595
00:37:32.908 --> 00:37:35.728
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you. Wow.

596
00:37:39.068 --> 00:37:42.089
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

597
00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:44.650
If we get on the road by Friday,

598
00:37:44.651 --> 00:37:47.451
we'll be able to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

599
00:37:48.009 --> 00:37:49.989
Have you ever been to Colorado?

600
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.231
No, ma'am.

601
00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:53.750
It must be wonderful.

602
00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.980
It must be incredibly
frustrating then

603
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.330
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

604
00:37:58.511 --> 00:38:00.950
This place
is as good a place as any.

605
00:38:01.031 --> 00:38:02.331
Think so?

606
00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:04.731
She should know.

607
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:08.172
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

608
00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:10.291
Places I didn't even know existed.

609
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:13.352
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

610
00:38:15.111 --> 00:38:19.911
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

611
00:38:19.992 --> 00:38:21.512
Why doesn't matter.

612
00:38:21.592 --> 00:38:24.992
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

613
00:38:25.073 --> 00:38:27.553
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

614
00:38:30.353 --> 00:38:33.393
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

615
00:38:33.473 --> 00:38:35.353
Isn't she?
Isn't she beautiful?

616
00:38:35.434 --> 00:38:37.414
Isn't she beautiful?

617
00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:44.154
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that

618
00:38:44.235 --> 00:38:46.555
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

619
00:38:46.675 --> 00:38:50.596
I'm not into that, that whole
external beauty thing, you know.

620
00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:54.075
- 'Cause it, it doesn't last.
- Right.

621
00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:57.517
You're, you know, eventually,
your face is gonna get wrinkly,

622
00:38:57.595 --> 00:38:59.036
- you'll get gray hair,
- Sure.

623
00:38:59.116 --> 00:39:03.017
your boobs might sag.
You know? So what?

624
00:39:03.397 --> 00:39:05.877
It's what you do
that really matters.

625
00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:08.497
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

626
00:39:08.876 --> 00:39:10.837
So what do you wanna do?

627
00:39:12.117 --> 00:39:15.277
Oh, uh, I don't know. I mean,
there's not so much to do here, really.

628
00:39:16.958 --> 00:39:21.358
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.

629
00:39:23.398 --> 00:39:25.197
Um...

630
00:39:25.717 --> 00:39:27.278
Thank you.

631
00:39:27.759 --> 00:39:29.679
It was nice meeting you.

632
00:39:31.799 --> 00:39:32.799
Be nice.

633
00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.460
Hello.

634
00:39:38.461 --> 00:39:39.661
- Hi.
- Hi.

635
00:39:47.061 --> 00:39:50.620
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

636
00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.601
No, we want the big one!

637
00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.362
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

638
00:39:56.443 --> 00:40:00.441
- No, we want the big one!
- Yeah, I like it.

639
00:40:00.561 --> 00:40:02.683
- Let's go.
- Come on! Get us the big one!

640
00:40:02.803 --> 00:40:05.562
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.

641
00:40:05.642 --> 00:40:08.422
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

642
00:40:10.062 --> 00:40:14.162
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.

643
00:40:14.243 --> 00:40:19.364
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

644
00:40:24.403 --> 00:40:26.224
I love the sky.

645
00:40:27.405 --> 00:40:30.904
It's so limitless.

646
00:40:31.925 --> 00:40:34.605
It is big.
It's very big.

647
00:40:34.685 --> 00:40:36.484
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

648
00:40:36.564 --> 00:40:38.885
That-That word "big" is so small.

649
00:40:39.005 --> 00:40:43.825
You'd have to get those really
giant words to describe the sky.

650
00:40:46.165 --> 00:40:48.046
Oh. Um...

651
00:40:48.527 --> 00:40:49.606
What?

652
00:40:51.426 --> 00:40:54.967
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

653
00:40:55.487 --> 00:40:58.487
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

654
00:40:58.568 --> 00:41:01.288
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

655
00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:08.529
I could come back. I mean, I can,
I can come back and...

656
00:41:08.609 --> 00:41:11.008
- Really?
- Yeah. Will you, you'll be here then?

657
00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:12.228
- Yeah.
- All right.

658
00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:13.129
I'll just sit here.

659
00:41:13.209 --> 00:41:14.929
All right, I'll be,
I'll be back in a little bit.

660
00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:16.469
- Okay.
- Okay.

661
00:41:19.189 --> 00:41:21.929
- Gilbert.
- Hey, buddy. Come on. We gotta go.

662
00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:24.129
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

663
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:27.649
- Gilbert, where's the duck?
- Where's the duck?

664
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.850
I can't see the duck anywhere.
Find him.

665
00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:32.291
- Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

666
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.690
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- Arnie, I don't have time for this.

667
00:41:35.769 --> 00:41:37.971
Lift up. Okay, good.

668
00:41:38.052 --> 00:41:41.011
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

669
00:41:41.092 --> 00:41:43.451
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

670
00:41:43.531 --> 00:41:45.491
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.

671
00:41:45.492 --> 00:41:46.192
Hey, you know what?

672
00:41:46.212 --> 00:41:48.991
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

673
00:41:50.372 --> 00:41:52.412
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

674
00:41:52.493 --> 00:41:54.293
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

675
00:41:54.373 --> 00:41:55.914
- Okay, take this.
- Take this.

676
00:41:56.115 --> 00:41:57.215
Wash everything.

677
00:41:57.533 --> 00:41:59.153
- Your towels are there,
- Okay.

678
00:41:59.154 --> 00:42:00.254
and your robe is there.

679
00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:01.452
- Okay.
- Okay?

680
00:42:01.532 --> 00:42:04.893
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right. Okay.

681
00:42:04.973 --> 00:42:06.214
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

682
00:42:06.215 --> 00:42:07.215
Gotta go.

683
00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:12.173
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

684
00:42:12.253 --> 00:42:14.453
- The sunset.
- Really?

685
00:42:14.533 --> 00:42:17.874
- It was beautiful.
- Oh. Oh, well.

686
00:42:22.094 --> 00:42:24.175
I'd like to see where you live.

687
00:42:25.095 --> 00:42:28.855
- No, you wouldn't.
- Let's go see where you live.

688
00:42:28.935 --> 00:42:30.315
Come on.

689
00:42:37.176 --> 00:42:39.738
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

690
00:42:41.136 --> 00:42:43.378
I go back and forth between them

691
00:42:43.457 --> 00:42:45.258
'cause they're always moving.

692
00:42:46.138 --> 00:42:49.478
But it's good.
It's my life.

693
00:42:50.538 --> 00:42:51.718
Yeah.

694
00:42:52.998 --> 00:42:54.697
We don't really move.

695
00:42:55.078 --> 00:42:56.899
I mean, we'd like to, but,

696
00:42:58.859 --> 00:43:01.338
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

697
00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:05.060
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

698
00:43:05.139 --> 00:43:07.118
She's pretty much wedged in.

699
00:43:07.498 --> 00:43:11.939
- What do you mean?
- That's it. That's the house.

700
00:43:14.599 --> 00:43:16.201
It's really amazing.

701
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.740
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the,

702
00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.541
the girth of what's inside of it.

703
00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:29.961
I don't know.

704
00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:34.222
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

705
00:43:34.301 --> 00:43:36.182
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

706
00:43:36.262 --> 00:43:39.302
That's her.
That's my mom.

707
00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:45.562
What about your dad?

708
00:43:46.942 --> 00:43:49.903
Some other day.
Some other day.

709
00:44:02.864 --> 00:44:05.505
I had a nice time tonight.

710
00:44:06.924 --> 00:44:08.285
I know.

711
00:44:12.385 --> 00:44:14.306
- Good night.
- Good night.

712
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:59.650
Oh, no. Oh, no.

713
00:45:00.229 --> 00:45:03.489
Oh, Arnie. Come on.
I'm sorry, buddy. Come on.

714
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.350
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

715
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.151
You're okay.
You're okay, buddy.

716
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.711
Come on. Get warm.

717
00:45:13.991 --> 00:45:17.311
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

718
00:45:17.391 --> 00:45:20.232
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:20.312 --> 00:45:22.751
Would somebody please explain?

720
00:45:22.871 --> 00:45:27.233
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
- I could have drownded.

721
00:45:27.312 --> 00:45:29.512
I could have drownded.

722
00:45:29.632 --> 00:45:31.912
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

723
00:45:31.992 --> 00:45:36.273
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths, Mama.

724
00:45:37.153 --> 00:45:40.354
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

725
00:45:40.474 --> 00:45:43.653
- No.
- It's ready.

726
00:45:43.673 --> 00:45:46.034
Where's your head lately, Gilbert?

727
00:45:46.114 --> 00:45:49.674
Where is your head?
Gilbert?

728
00:45:49.754 --> 00:45:53.074
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

729
00:45:53.235 --> 00:45:57.435
- You gotta do better.
- Gotta do better.

730
00:45:59.455 --> 00:46:02.354
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

731
00:46:03.235 --> 00:46:04.656
That's right.

732
00:46:05.236 --> 00:46:08.755
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

733
00:46:08.875 --> 00:46:12.036
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

734
00:46:12.116 --> 00:46:13.336
Here.

735
00:46:16.037 --> 00:46:17.957
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

736
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:19.458
It sounds urgent.

737
00:46:30.039 --> 00:46:32.578
Uh, get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

738
00:46:32.658 --> 00:46:35.339
- But...
- Right now. Hurry up.

739
00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.440
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

740
00:46:47.479 --> 00:46:50.198
Gilbert, could you dial that number
over there for me?

741
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.979
- My hands are all...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

742
00:46:53.559 --> 00:46:55.680
- How have you been?
- Good.

743
00:46:55.961 --> 00:46:57.960
I saw you last night.

744
00:46:58.841 --> 00:47:00.860
Who's the girl?

745
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:05.061
- It's ringing.
- I got, sorry. One sec.

746
00:47:06.521 --> 00:47:08.882
This is good. Taste.

747
00:47:08.961 --> 00:47:10.762
That's good. It's, uh, ringing.

748
00:47:10.842 --> 00:47:12.102
One second.

749
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:16.722
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

750
00:47:16.802 --> 00:47:21.603
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

751
00:47:21.683 --> 00:47:22.802
Mr Carver?

752
00:47:23.003 --> 00:47:24.203
<i>Who is this?</i>

753
00:47:24.483 --> 00:47:26.544
Uh, it's Gilbert.

754
00:47:26.745 --> 00:47:27.845
<i>Gilbert!</i>

755
00:47:28.723 --> 00:47:30.604
<i>I'd given up on you, Gilbert.</i>

756
00:47:30.705 --> 00:47:31.605
Did you?

757
00:47:31.684 --> 00:47:33.064
<i>Well, yeah. Can you blame me?</i>

758
00:47:33.065 --> 00:47:34.365
No, no.

759
00:47:34.443 --> 00:47:38.245
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

760
00:47:38.325 --> 00:47:40.724
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

761
00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:42.964
<i>Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best,</i>

762
00:47:43.045 --> 00:47:45.765
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

763
00:47:45.844 --> 00:47:46.585
Yes.

764
00:47:46.886 --> 00:47:48.286
Today is your lucky day.

765
00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:51.686
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

766
00:47:55.125 --> 00:47:56.726
Is that a yes, Gilbert?

767
00:47:57.907 --> 00:47:58.625
Okay.

768
00:47:58.626 --> 00:47:59.426
<i>All right.</i>

769
00:47:59.505 --> 00:48:01.447
I'm gonna be waiting
here for you, Gilbert.

770
00:48:01.527 --> 00:48:02.727
Bye.

771
00:48:04.207 --> 00:48:06.967
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

772
00:48:07.087 --> 00:48:10.127
Just playing.
Don't-Don't you wanna play?

773
00:48:10.207 --> 00:48:13.127
This is crazy.
I, uh, I've gotta go.

774
00:48:13.207 --> 00:48:15.566
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

775
00:48:15.647 --> 00:48:16.787
Hey!

776
00:48:18.967 --> 00:48:21.409
It's that new girl, isn't it?

777
00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:24.289
No, it's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

778
00:48:25.207 --> 00:48:27.489
If you walk out that door...

779
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.709
Don't you dare walk out that door.

780
00:48:53.852 --> 00:48:56.171
You look nervous, Gilbert.

781
00:48:57.252 --> 00:48:59.811
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

782
00:49:00.452 --> 00:49:04.051
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

783
00:49:05.091 --> 00:49:06.893
I reviewed your file.

784
00:49:07.772 --> 00:49:10.452
You've got
no major medical insurance.

785
00:49:10.973 --> 00:49:13.974
No catastrophic, no life.

786
00:49:15.173 --> 00:49:16.473
Gilbert,

787
00:49:17.853 --> 00:49:20.313
what if something
were to happen to you?

788
00:49:21.493 --> 00:49:24.134
Something unforeseeable?

789
00:49:24.154 --> 00:49:26.794
Something sudden? Random?

790
00:49:27.854 --> 00:49:31.834
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

791
00:49:33.336 --> 00:49:35.495
Do you ever think about your family?

792
00:49:37.016 --> 00:49:39.936
Now, stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

793
00:49:41.216 --> 00:49:44.295
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

794
00:49:44.976 --> 00:49:46.616
Ken Carver here.

795
00:49:47.496 --> 00:49:49.416
Look, can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

796
00:49:50.775 --> 00:49:55.576
Oh. Betty, please, calm down.
Calm down.

797
00:49:55.656 --> 00:49:58.937
No, no. I, I...
No, go on.

798
00:49:59.017 --> 00:50:00.937
Go on, go on.

799
00:50:02.297 --> 00:50:05.557
No.
No.

800
00:50:13.859 --> 00:50:15.738
No, no. Calm...

801
00:50:15.859 --> 00:50:18.139
I'll... I'm on my way.

802
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.439
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

803
00:50:26.421 --> 00:50:28.860
Oh, damn.
Betty's got the car.

804
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.120
Gilbert, would you give me a ride?

805
00:50:51.822 --> 00:50:53.902
Oh, my God! Betty!

806
00:50:53.982 --> 00:50:56.062
What the hell's going on here?

807
00:50:56.142 --> 00:50:58.983
Todd? Doug?
Betty, what is going on here?

808
00:50:59.064 --> 00:51:00.663
I don't believe this!

809
00:51:02.343 --> 00:51:06.383
Oh, great!
Oh, God!

810
00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:07.984
Boys, come on.
Let's...

811
00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:11.364
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

812
00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:13.464
This is great.

813
00:51:15.664 --> 00:51:17.985
All right.
Everything's okay.

814
00:51:18.066 --> 00:51:19.885
These aren't burned.

815
00:51:20.364 --> 00:51:23.986
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

816
00:51:24.065 --> 00:51:26.704
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

817
00:51:26.784 --> 00:51:28.545
They're wonderful.

818
00:51:29.626 --> 00:51:32.786
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

819
00:51:32.865 --> 00:51:34.486
They're really good. Here.

820
00:51:34.566 --> 00:51:36.446
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

821
00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:39.586
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies. Please. Please.

822
00:51:39.866 --> 00:51:41.046
Hey.

823
00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:46.026
I could've had any guy. Any guy!

824
00:51:46.907 --> 00:51:47.927
But...

825
00:51:49.147 --> 00:51:50.728
I chose you.

826
00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.768
I chose you.

827
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:56.548
Look! There's water in here!

828
00:51:56.628 --> 00:51:59.068
Come here! Come here!
Get over here!

829
00:51:59.148 --> 00:52:01.988
Come here!
Get inside the pool!

830
00:52:02.068 --> 00:52:04.870
Get inside the pool with your brother!
Come here!

831
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:06.149
Why did you?

832
00:52:12.669 --> 00:52:14.070
Because,

833
00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.609
I knew you'd always be there.
Because,

834
00:52:19.489 --> 00:52:21.650
because I knew you'd never leave.

835
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.110
What the hell else more do you want?

836
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.991
What? For God's sake!

837
00:52:29.832 --> 00:52:33.891
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

838
00:52:35.032 --> 00:52:37.831
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

839
00:52:37.911 --> 00:52:41.672
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

840
00:52:41.752 --> 00:52:45.172
I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!

841
00:52:56.714 --> 00:52:59.194
I, I, I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.

842
00:52:59.214 --> 00:53:00.534
Not yet.

843
00:53:01.714 --> 00:53:05.974
Arthur, in all my life I wondered,

844
00:53:06.794 --> 00:53:08.014
where is he?

845
00:53:09.675 --> 00:53:12.715
Just this moment, just now.

846
00:53:14.156 --> 00:53:18.555
What is he looking at?
What is he thinking?

847
00:53:18.635 --> 00:53:20.596
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

848
00:53:20.675 --> 00:53:21.995
No!

849
00:53:23.376 --> 00:53:25.977
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

850
00:53:26.356 --> 00:53:27.917
Just let him stink.

851
00:53:28.797 --> 00:53:31.796
I don't wanna take a bath!
No!

852
00:53:31.877 --> 00:53:33.278
You know Mr Carver?

853
00:53:35.558 --> 00:53:37.077
Well, he's dead.

854
00:53:39.998 --> 00:53:42.039
He's dead.

855
00:53:53.819 --> 00:53:56.159
Okay, kids, hurry up.
Let's go.

856
00:53:58.799 --> 00:54:00.420
- Hi.
- Hey.

857
00:54:03.879 --> 00:54:06.680
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

858
00:54:08.081 --> 00:54:10.240
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

859
00:54:13.081 --> 00:54:17.000
- A kiddie pool. I don't get it.
- Wow.

860
00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.641
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

861
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:21.681
- Oh, yeah.
- He, he drownded.

862
00:54:30.543 --> 00:54:33.162
He had the cardiac arrest.

863
00:54:33.443 --> 00:54:36.922
His head bent forward,
his knees buckled

864
00:54:37.003 --> 00:54:39.623
and then he just fell

865
00:54:40.884 --> 00:54:42.524
face forward into the pool.

866
00:54:42.603 --> 00:54:44.965
When she found him,
he was already dead.

867
00:54:45.044 --> 00:54:47.124
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

868
00:54:47.284 --> 00:54:51.024
No, I know it. I would,
I saw the, I saw the, I saw the body.

869
00:54:51.105 --> 00:54:52.984
I saw the, I prepared it.
I know exactly what...

870
00:54:52.985 --> 00:54:53.685
You don't know...

871
00:54:53.765 --> 00:54:55.805
I would have seen,
I would have seen what

872
00:54:55.884 --> 00:54:58.365
if there was any kind of struggle
that had gone on.

873
00:54:58.446 --> 00:55:00.525
- It was murder.
- No.

874
00:55:01.205 --> 00:55:03.465
What do you think?
What do you think?

875
00:55:03.485 --> 00:55:07.065
I, uh, I don't know.
I, um, you know, it's, it's possible.

876
00:55:07.085 --> 00:55:10.607
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

877
00:55:10.727 --> 00:55:12.446
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...

878
00:55:12.447 --> 00:55:13.647
Even if she did wanna do it...

879
00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:15.406
She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.

880
00:55:15.486 --> 00:55:18.207
Even if she did,
if, if you saw somebody laying

881
00:55:18.287 --> 00:55:21.208
with their head down
in the pool motionless,

882
00:55:21.287 --> 00:55:24.247
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that,

883
00:55:24.328 --> 00:55:26.767
- which he wasn't doing, but even if that...
- You don't know that!

884
00:55:26.847 --> 00:55:31.189
Well, it, it was an extreme, uh,
post-cardial infarction. Extreme.

885
00:55:31.268 --> 00:55:33.688
- So nothing's fishy?
- N-No.

886
00:55:33.967 --> 00:55:36.309
Hey, Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

887
00:55:36.388 --> 00:55:38.688
- Gilbert, it's that girl!
- It's perfectly logical.

888
00:55:38.769 --> 00:55:41.289
Even if it's,
listen. Wait a minute, Tucker.

889
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:42.629
- We're not talkin' about...
- And even if she...

890
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:44.130
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

891
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:48.609
We're talkin' about pushin' along
something that's rolling that direction.

892
00:55:48.729 --> 00:55:50.491
- Please, play with me over there.
- Okay.

893
00:55:50.571 --> 00:55:53.290
Please? Come on. Let's play over there.
Come on. Please play...

894
00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:54.449
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?

895
00:55:54.469 --> 00:55:57.171
- Fine.
- Will you play over there? Will you play?

896
00:55:57.251 --> 00:55:58.310
- Okay. Okay, we'll play.
- Settle down.

897
00:55:58.311 --> 00:56:00.311
- We're gonna play!
- Okay, okay.

898
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.650
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.

899
00:56:07.572 --> 00:56:08.912
So, that's it.

900
00:56:10.132 --> 00:56:11.811
Yeah, I guess so.

901
00:56:15.051 --> 00:56:17.054
The magic part.

902
00:56:22.093 --> 00:56:24.072
The magic part?

903
00:56:25.252 --> 00:56:27.493
The magic part, Gilbert?

904
00:56:33.253 --> 00:56:35.134
- Hey, could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.

905
00:56:35.194 --> 00:56:39.013
- Yeah? Oh, thanks.
- Can we go play now?

906
00:56:39.094 --> 00:56:40.335
What are we gonna play?

907
00:56:40.336 --> 00:56:41.336
- Hi.
- Hi.

908
00:56:41.414 --> 00:56:43.735
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
Hide-and-go-seek?

909
00:56:43.815 --> 00:56:45.374
- You like that?
- Gilbert?

910
00:56:45.454 --> 00:56:48.155
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

911
00:56:54.296 --> 00:56:56.937
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

912
00:56:58.936 --> 00:57:00.015
Try it.

913
00:57:09.298 --> 00:57:11.797
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.

914
00:57:11.817 --> 00:57:15.178
I don't,
it's a mystery.

915
00:57:15.257 --> 00:57:18.358
- Gilbert, listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

916
00:57:19.057 --> 00:57:21.819
Come play with me in the water.

917
00:57:21.899 --> 00:57:25.178
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

918
00:57:25.258 --> 00:57:27.619
Say, say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

919
00:57:27.698 --> 00:57:29.779
No, I want you to come in with me.

920
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:31.179
No.

921
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.739
Say "Where's Arnie?"

922
00:57:33.819 --> 00:57:35.300
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

923
00:57:35.379 --> 00:57:37.579
Where's Arnie?

924
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:41.941
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

925
00:57:42.021 --> 00:57:45.260
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

926
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.382
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

927
00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:50.940
Don't even try it, 'cause he's,
he's had a scare with water

928
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.221
and he won't,
he won't come in.

929
00:57:53.301 --> 00:57:55.502
I'm not comin' in the water.

930
00:57:57.022 --> 00:58:00.002
- You wanna come in the water?
- No.

931
00:58:00.781 --> 00:58:02.102
Why not?

932
00:58:04.902 --> 00:58:06.983
Are you scared
to come in the water?

933
00:58:07.062 --> 00:58:09.702
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

934
00:58:09.782 --> 00:58:12.543
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

935
00:58:12.963 --> 00:58:15.102
Are you scared, Gilbert?

936
00:58:15.982 --> 00:58:19.264
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

937
00:58:19.343 --> 00:58:22.344
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

938
00:58:22.425 --> 00:58:24.464
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

939
00:58:27.906 --> 00:58:29.504
A little more.

940
00:58:31.504 --> 00:58:33.025
Do you wanna see this?

941
00:58:34.366 --> 00:58:37.986
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?

942
00:58:44.326 --> 00:58:48.107
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

943
00:58:49.666 --> 00:58:51.307
- Okay?
- Okay.

944
00:58:51.386 --> 00:58:52.967
Okay, what do you want?

945
00:58:54.587 --> 00:58:56.786
- Faster!
- Okay.

946
00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.587
I want a new thing.

947
00:59:00.508 --> 00:59:03.548
House. I want a new house
for the family.

948
00:59:06.568 --> 00:59:08.908
I want a,
I want Mama

949
00:59:09.028 --> 00:59:11.269
to take aerobics classes.

950
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:13.908
I want Ellen to grow up.

951
00:59:14.828 --> 00:59:17.030
I want a new brain for Arnie.

952
00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.588
I want...

953
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:22.410
What do you want for you?

954
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.210
Just for you.

955
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:28.470
I want to be a good person.

956
00:59:32.671 --> 00:59:34.830
I can't, I can't do this.
I can't...

957
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:37.951
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

958
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:42.131
Arnie?

959
00:59:46.212 --> 00:59:48.832
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

960
00:59:48.912 --> 00:59:50.071
No.

961
01:00:05.093 --> 01:00:06.353
Shit.

962
01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:22.356
- Hey!
- Come on.

963
01:00:22.476 --> 01:00:25.134
Hey! Over here!

964
01:00:26.474 --> 01:00:27.996
- Hang on, son.
- Come on, now.

965
01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:30.716
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

966
01:00:31.235 --> 01:00:33.716
All right, here we go.
There you go.

967
01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.796
It's all right, Jerry. I got him.
I got him. It's all right, Jerry.

968
01:00:35.877 --> 01:00:37.097
We're takin' him in.

969
01:00:38.276 --> 01:00:40.157
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise this time.

970
01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.117
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister

971
01:00:42.197 --> 01:00:43.958
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

972
01:00:44.037 --> 01:00:47.518
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights! Play the siren, okay?

973
01:00:47.597 --> 01:00:49.557
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

974
01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:51.358
Way to go, Gilbert.

975
01:00:53.578 --> 01:00:54.438
Jerry, listen. You're gonna,

976
01:00:54.439 --> 01:00:55.839
- you're gonna have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him, Gilbert.

977
01:00:55.859 --> 01:00:56.639
You gotta,

978
01:00:56.718 --> 01:00:59.298
- really, you gotta keep an eye on him.
- All right. All right.

979
01:00:59.878 --> 01:01:01.999
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

980
01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:05.959
Do the siren. Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

981
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.760
I know, Sheriff.

982
01:01:21.601 --> 01:01:23.261
I know that, Sheriff.

983
01:01:24.841 --> 01:01:28.181
Okay.
Asshole.

984
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.321
They're probably just teaching him a lesson.
They're probably just proving a point.

985
01:01:32.441 --> 01:01:34.022
Yeah. That's right.

986
01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.723
Get my coat.

987
01:01:40.443 --> 01:01:41.643
What?

988
01:01:43.022 --> 01:01:44.543
Get my coat.

989
01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.343
Get it!

990
01:01:59.545 --> 01:02:01.004
Let's go.

991
01:02:12.766 --> 01:02:16.465
Well, at least he's in a safe place.
At least someone's watching him.

992
01:02:16.475 --> 01:02:18.226
Ellen, shut up.

993
01:02:31.967 --> 01:02:34.247
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

994
01:02:34.268 --> 01:02:36.888
Mama.
Mama, let Gilbert handle this.

995
01:02:44.468 --> 01:02:48.087
- Jerry, come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

996
01:02:48.167 --> 01:02:50.968
- Please, you gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

997
01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:54.089
I don't think you guys understand.

998
01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:55.290
- It's gonna be...
- Look.

999
01:02:55.369 --> 01:02:59.051
No one's going to do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

1000
01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:00.349
Jerry!

1001
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:04.311
Jerry!

1002
01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.531
Jerry!

1003
01:03:18.332 --> 01:03:22.011
Jerry, I've come for my son.

1004
01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:26.772
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

1005
01:03:26.892 --> 01:03:29.073
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

1006
01:03:29.093 --> 01:03:31.232
No! No!

1007
01:03:31.253 --> 01:03:33.752
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

1008
01:03:33.772 --> 01:03:38.093
- But Bonnie, you have to calm...
- My son! Give me my son!

1009
01:03:48.834 --> 01:03:51.355
Come on. You're goin' home.

1010
01:03:53.313 --> 01:03:56.855
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

1011
01:03:57.715 --> 01:04:00.656
- Don't disappear like that any more.
- Okay.

1012
01:04:00.735 --> 01:04:03.856
- Promise me.
- Mom!

1013
01:04:04.035 --> 01:04:06.795
You're free, baby. You're free.
Let's go home.

1014
01:04:12.795 --> 01:04:14.397
Hi!

1015
01:04:15.277 --> 01:04:16.797
Look!

1016
01:04:28.678 --> 01:04:31.119
That's why she needs a cane.

1017
01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.320
She's enormous.

1018
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.061
Look at her!

1019
01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:21.083
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

1020
01:05:23.323 --> 01:05:25.483
Flash the lights.

1021
01:05:31.004 --> 01:05:32.484
Hey!

1022
01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:35.005
Look at me!

1023
01:05:35.725 --> 01:05:39.604
I'm hiding!
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"

1024
01:05:39.684 --> 01:05:41.785
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

1025
01:05:45.845 --> 01:05:47.865
Gilbert, come find me.

1026
01:05:49.166 --> 01:05:51.145
Where's Arnie?

1027
01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:54.867
Hey.

1028
01:05:55.447 --> 01:05:57.566
That's my mom in there.

1029
01:05:57.646 --> 01:05:59.287
My mama.

1030
01:06:00.007 --> 01:06:02.367
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

1031
01:06:02.846 --> 01:06:04.806
Come play with me.

1032
01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.349
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

1033
01:06:24.368 --> 01:06:26.070
You know that, right?

1034
01:06:28.409 --> 01:06:30.129
I'd like to meet her.

1035
01:06:30.809 --> 01:06:32.230
No, you wouldn't.

1036
01:06:36.151 --> 01:06:37.870
Hey, where do you go next?

1037
01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:16.673
I would like to meet your mom.

1038
01:07:24.414 --> 01:07:29.015
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life,

1039
01:07:29.094 --> 01:07:32.616
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver,

1040
01:07:33.255 --> 01:07:36.055
and we commit his body
to the ground.

1041
01:07:36.336 --> 01:07:38.295
Earth to earth,

1042
01:07:39.375 --> 01:07:42.976
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

1043
01:07:44.256 --> 01:07:46.476
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

1044
01:07:46.636 --> 01:07:49.096
The Lord make his face
shine on him

1045
01:07:49.176 --> 01:07:51.137
and be gracious to him.

1046
01:07:51.257 --> 01:07:54.056
The Lord look upon him
with favor

1047
01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.897
and give him peace.

1048
01:07:57.217 --> 01:08:01.238
Lord Jesus, by your death
you took away the sting of death.

1049
01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:04.699
Grant to us, your servants,
so to follow in faith

1050
01:08:04.778 --> 01:08:07.218
- for you have led the way...
- Hey! Hey!

1051
01:08:07.298 --> 01:08:08.158
that we may at length

1052
01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:10.659
- fall asleep peacefully in you...
- Lookit here! Lookit here!

1053
01:08:10.698 --> 01:08:13.160
- great in your likeness...
- Look where I'm pointing!

1054
01:08:13.239 --> 01:08:16.500
- the God of peace who brought again
- Look! Look, it's coming!

1055
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.699
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.
The great shepherd of the sheep,

1056
01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.500
through the blood
of the everlasting covenant...

1057
01:08:20.579 --> 01:08:22.400
It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!

1058
01:08:22.401 --> 01:08:24.701
make you perfect in
every good work to do his will...

1059
01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.839
- Gilbert, it's a Burger Barn!
- working in you that

1060
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.740
which is well pleasing in his sight...

1061
01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:32.440
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, Amen.

1062
01:08:37.342 --> 01:08:41.301
- Hey.
- Boys, you can have anything you want.

1063
01:08:41.321 --> 01:08:45.541
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want too.

1064
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.143
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

1065
01:08:48.181 --> 01:08:50.813
You like gum?
Do you like gum?

1066
01:08:50.823 --> 01:08:53.222
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

1067
01:08:53.302 --> 01:08:56.963
Here, take this.
You can have it. Take it.

1068
01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:02.704
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St Louis.

1069
01:09:02.784 --> 01:09:04.903
I can't stay in that house.

1070
01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:09.865
I really am sorry about your...

1071
01:09:12.365 --> 01:09:15.484
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

1072
01:09:19.585 --> 01:09:21.724
Everybody thinks I killed him.

1073
01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:25.426
Do you?

1074
01:09:27.165 --> 01:09:28.247
No.

1075
01:09:36.587 --> 01:09:38.107
I miss him...

1076
01:09:41.947 --> 01:09:43.667
and I don't.

1077
01:09:43.787 --> 01:09:45.847
I miss him, and I don't.

1078
01:09:59.909 --> 01:10:04.588
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

1079
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:08.710
Oh, I'll probably just...

1080
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:10.629
You haven't thought about it.

1081
01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:15.371
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

1082
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:19.151
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

1083
01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:21.771
- Mommy?
- Mommy is coming in a minute, honey.

1084
01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:23.271
Okay.

1085
01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:29.251
Concerning my boys?

1086
01:10:29.471 --> 01:10:34.052
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

1087
01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:38.833
Hi.

1088
01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.353
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice

1089
01:10:51.433 --> 01:10:53.774
for my boys to be like you.

1090
01:11:10.555 --> 01:11:12.455
He's all yours.

1091
01:11:23.115 --> 01:11:24.897
Are you gonna miss her?

1092
01:11:27.197 --> 01:11:28.477
Yeah.

1093
01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:34.317
Good.

1094
01:12:33.443 --> 01:12:34.683
Damn it!

1095
01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:02.845
So, what do you think?

1096
01:13:05.086 --> 01:13:06.806
- Wow.
- Right?

1097
01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:08.707
- Wow.
- Right?

1098
01:13:09.186 --> 01:13:10.727
Here, try a milkshake.

1099
01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:16.267
Real milk in there.

1100
01:13:16.687 --> 01:13:18.506
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

1101
01:13:24.327 --> 01:13:26.428
Bob, oh, Bob.

1102
01:13:28.048 --> 01:13:31.208
- Hey! Congratulations! This looks great!
- Thanks, Bob.

1103
01:13:31.328 --> 01:13:33.489
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks a million.
- What?

1104
01:13:33.568 --> 01:13:36.310
What, are you tryin' to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin everyone's appetite.

1105
01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:40.230
Hey, hey. I, Mike, right?
You wanna come to my party tomorrow?

1106
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.790
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

1107
01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.450
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

1108
01:13:47.809 --> 01:13:51.249
How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.

1109
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:55.231
This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora,

1110
01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:59.691
for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.

1111
01:13:59.771 --> 01:14:02.532
We at Burger Barn are committed

1112
01:14:02.612 --> 01:14:07.451
to a very special relationship with you,
one that will last and last.

1113
01:14:07.532 --> 01:14:10.412
In a time when so many things
are falling apart

1114
01:14:10.891 --> 01:14:14.311
Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance,

1115
01:14:15.133 --> 01:14:17.372
a new breath of life.

1116
01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:22.094
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed

1117
01:14:22.174 --> 01:14:24.813
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

1118
01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:48.635
Come on!

1119
01:15:05.497 --> 01:15:09.016
Hey, you can come to my party tomorrow,
okay? You can come.

1120
01:15:09.096 --> 01:15:10.418
Okay.

1121
01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:18.518
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.

1122
01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:20.319
So, I'm invited.

1123
01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:24.279
Okay.

1124
01:15:31.939 --> 01:15:34.940
- Do you not want me to go?
- No.

1125
01:15:35.019 --> 01:15:37.860
I mean, go if you want.

1126
01:15:41.341 --> 01:15:44.701
Oh, so this is,
is this how you want it?

1127
01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:52.301
I have to go.

1128
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:57.562
Take care, okay?

1129
01:16:05.383 --> 01:16:07.303
Goodbye, Arnie.

1130
01:16:08.242 --> 01:16:11.344
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get that bath.

1131
01:16:11.384 --> 01:16:14.042
No. No!

1132
01:16:14.263 --> 01:16:15.685
Hey, Arnie?

1133
01:16:16.564 --> 01:16:19.084
- Arnie?
- Guys!

1134
01:16:19.204 --> 01:16:20.424
Arnie.

1135
01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:23.084
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

1136
01:16:23.764 --> 01:16:24.844
Arnie.

1137
01:16:26.964 --> 01:16:29.205
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

1138
01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:32.805
- Arnie!
- Oh, no!

1139
01:16:32.884 --> 01:16:35.866
- Damn it!
- Arnie, no!

1140
01:16:37.246 --> 01:16:39.205
Oh, God.

1141
01:16:40.285 --> 01:16:43.206
I can't make another one.
I can't.

1142
01:16:45.807 --> 01:16:48.066
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

1143
01:17:03.768 --> 01:17:06.908
<i>Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember, every day this week</i>

1144
01:17:06.928 --> 01:17:08.849
<i>is a double coupon day.</i>

1145
01:17:18.049 --> 01:17:20.529
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

1146
01:17:20.609 --> 01:17:23.769
Um, my sister called in
an order for Grape.

1147
01:17:23.850 --> 01:17:25.930
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all set.

1148
01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:32.410
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

1149
01:17:48.632 --> 01:17:50.991
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

1150
01:17:51.012 --> 01:17:53.973
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's-What's in that box?

1151
01:17:54.053 --> 01:17:55.893
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'm gonna kill you.

1152
01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.813
I can't believe you.

1153
01:17:57.893 --> 01:18:01.893
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1154
01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:04.093
Now, you'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1155
01:18:04.174 --> 01:18:06.094
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1156
01:18:07.615 --> 01:18:09.114
I mean, it's Arnie's 18th birthday.

1157
01:18:09.115 --> 01:18:11.215
Haven't you been waiting
to do this for a long time?

1158
01:18:11.335 --> 01:18:14.336
I mean, wasn't it you that wanted to
have this huge party in the first place?

1159
01:18:14.455 --> 01:18:16.315
I didn't want to.

1160
01:18:18.095 --> 01:18:20.896
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1161
01:18:20.975 --> 01:18:22.955
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.

1162
01:18:22.956 --> 01:18:24.256
Look, he's eating the cake!

1163
01:18:24.336 --> 01:18:25.256
- Shit!
- Arnie!

1164
01:18:25.337 --> 01:18:27.796
- That's it. Forget it. Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.

1165
01:18:27.816 --> 01:18:30.456
- Arnie!
- Now what are we gonna do?

1166
01:18:31.216 --> 01:18:34.257
Arnie! Arnie.

1167
01:18:34.337 --> 01:18:36.476
Come here. Come here! Come here!

1168
01:18:36.496 --> 01:18:39.458
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1169
01:18:40.778 --> 01:18:43.217
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1170
01:18:50.938 --> 01:18:53.939
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1171
01:18:59.939 --> 01:19:01.559
- Get in that bath.
- Gilbert, no!

1172
01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.960
Get your fucking clothes off.

1173
01:19:03.219 --> 01:19:04.259
Come on.

1174
01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.740
- Gilbert, no!
- Don't move. Don't move!

1175
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:11.539
Gilbert, stop!

1176
01:19:39.223 --> 01:19:40.502
Gilbert!

1177
01:19:41.122 --> 01:19:42.703
What did you do?

1178
01:20:00.323 --> 01:20:01.925
Mama!

1179
01:20:04.185 --> 01:20:05.506
Arnie?

1180
01:20:08.986 --> 01:20:10.405
Arnie!

1181
01:20:14.906 --> 01:20:16.826
What is goin' on?

1182
01:20:18.226 --> 01:20:21.386
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1183
01:22:07.136 --> 01:22:10.397
- We should call his mother.
- No, no, no. It's okay. I know,

1184
01:22:10.476 --> 01:22:12.636
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1185
01:22:12.756 --> 01:22:14.677
It's really okay. Yeah.

1186
01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:25.338
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1187
01:22:27.837 --> 01:22:29.879
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1188
01:22:48.679 --> 01:22:50.400
Come on, Arnie.

1189
01:22:59.682 --> 01:23:02.380
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it.

1190
01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:07.802
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1191
01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:10.842
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1192
01:23:10.962 --> 01:23:13.042
Row, row, row your boat

1193
01:23:13.123 --> 01:23:16.043
Gently down the stream

1194
01:23:16.123 --> 01:23:19.324
Yea! Yea!
You did it!

1195
01:23:20.483 --> 01:23:24.122
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1196
01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:32.524
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1197
01:23:32.605 --> 01:23:34.724
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1198
01:23:34.804 --> 01:23:36.363
Take care.

1199
01:23:36.484 --> 01:23:39.486
You know, I drownded, huh?
I drownded over there.

1200
01:23:39.566 --> 01:23:42.124
No, you just got clean.

1201
01:23:43.845 --> 01:23:45.545
Arnie!

1202
01:23:47.325 --> 01:23:49.946
Hi! How are you?

1203
01:23:53.565 --> 01:23:55.407
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1204
01:23:55.487 --> 01:23:57.686
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1205
01:23:57.806 --> 01:24:00.047
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.

1206
01:24:00.048 --> 01:24:01.348
You're welcome.

1207
01:24:28.089 --> 01:24:29.491
I hit him.

1208
01:24:31.211 --> 01:24:33.249
I hit him so hard, I...

1209
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:38.770
He's gonna be okay.

1210
01:24:40.891 --> 01:24:43.650
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1211
01:24:52.971 --> 01:24:56.812
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1212
01:25:26.175 --> 01:25:28.094
I got nowhere to go.

1213
01:25:34.655 --> 01:25:37.177
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1214
01:25:38.576 --> 01:25:40.736
So it's your fault?

1215
01:25:41.416 --> 01:25:44.875
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1216
01:25:45.256 --> 01:25:48.056
He didn't say goodbye.
He just,

1217
01:25:49.537 --> 01:25:53.097
one day, all of a sudden,

1218
01:25:55.497 --> 01:25:57.097
he was gone.

1219
01:25:58.577 --> 01:26:00.778
He was just hangin' there.

1220
01:26:02.659 --> 01:26:04.458
That's when it all started.

1221
01:26:06.739 --> 01:26:08.699
She used to be so pretty.

1222
01:26:09.819 --> 01:26:14.539
She was so pretty
and so fun.

1223
01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.940
So you think it's his fault?

1224
01:26:21.721 --> 01:26:22.960
No.

1225
01:26:24.339 --> 01:26:28.421
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1226
01:26:28.441 --> 01:26:30.381
He was just sort of there.

1227
01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.341
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around

1228
01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:37.421
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to

1229
01:26:37.501 --> 01:26:39.622
I don't know, get mad.

1230
01:26:41.562 --> 01:26:44.501
But nothin'.

1231
01:26:46.143 --> 01:26:48.703
Just like, uh, he was already dead.

1232
01:26:52.823 --> 01:26:55.284
I used to know a guy like that.

1233
01:28:17.511 --> 01:28:20.291
- Hey.
- Hi.

1234
01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:27.532
It's Arnie's birthday.

1235
01:28:28.312 --> 01:28:29.991
I need to go home.

1236
01:28:54.793 --> 01:28:56.314
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1237
01:28:56.394 --> 01:28:58.314
Give my regards to your mother.

1238
01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:02.715
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1239
01:29:02.795 --> 01:29:04.155
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1240
01:29:04.156 --> 01:29:05.656
He's alive.

1241
01:29:24.516 --> 01:29:25.557
Amy?

1242
01:29:27.437 --> 01:29:28.757
Where's Arnie?

1243
01:29:33.238 --> 01:29:36.658
Amy.
Please, Amy.

1244
01:29:40.359 --> 01:29:41.778
Is he okay?

1245
01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:47.139
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1246
01:29:52.539 --> 01:29:54.300
Where is he?

1247
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.760
I wonder where he could be.

1248
01:30:12.281 --> 01:30:13.502
Amy?

1249
01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:18.602
Have you seen Arnie?

1250
01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:22.623
Um, no, I thought he was with you.

1251
01:30:22.643 --> 01:30:24.762
- No.
- No?

1252
01:30:24.843 --> 01:30:26.283
No.

1253
01:30:33.523 --> 01:30:35.404
Arnie?

1254
01:30:38.163 --> 01:30:41.284
Arnie?
Anybody seen Arnie?

1255
01:30:42.964 --> 01:30:44.585
Where's my brother?

1256
01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:50.745
Boo!

1257
01:30:54.245 --> 01:30:55.506
Boo.

1258
01:31:04.166 --> 01:31:05.966
Come here.

1259
01:31:06.045 --> 01:31:07.806
You scared me, buddy.

1260
01:31:09.526 --> 01:31:13.566
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1261
01:31:14.208 --> 01:31:17.006
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1262
01:31:31.769 --> 01:31:33.210
Come here.

1263
01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.348
Who's got you?

1264
01:31:51.731 --> 01:31:53.771
You better talk to Mama.

1265
01:31:58.331 --> 01:31:59.611
Mama?

1266
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:09.672
Mama?

1267
01:32:15.212 --> 01:32:17.253
What you did was...

1268
01:32:21.453 --> 01:32:23.993
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1269
01:32:30.455 --> 01:32:32.975
And then disappearing like that?

1270
01:32:34.495 --> 01:32:36.195
I hate that.

1271
01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:39.475
You know how I hate that.

1272
01:32:42.935 --> 01:32:45.456
You walked out,
and I thought,

1273
01:32:45.536 --> 01:32:47.616
I can't take another.

1274
01:32:50.897 --> 01:32:53.156
But you came back, Gilbert.

1275
01:32:54.335 --> 01:32:55.657
Why?

1276
01:32:56.736 --> 01:32:58.416
Why did you?

1277
01:33:06.217 --> 01:33:08.137
I don't know, Mama.

1278
01:33:09.617 --> 01:33:13.938
I'm here now.
I'm here now.

1279
01:33:16.939 --> 01:33:19.178
Yes, you are.

1280
01:33:20.259 --> 01:33:22.519
You came back for the party.

1281
01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.960
Oh, Gilbert.

1282
01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:34.300
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1283
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.460
I know what a burden I am.

1284
01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.461
Don't say that.

1285
01:33:42.901 --> 01:33:44.661
I know it.

1286
01:33:45.341 --> 01:33:48.061
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1287
01:33:49.382 --> 01:33:50.901
No, I'm not.

1288
01:33:51.982 --> 01:33:53.521
No, I'm not.

1289
01:34:00.863 --> 01:34:05.522
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1290
01:34:06.943 --> 01:34:10.064
I never wanted to be a joke.

1291
01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:13.663
- You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.

1292
01:34:13.743 --> 01:34:15.324
You're no joke.

1293
01:34:16.105 --> 01:34:18.864
- You're no joke.
- Oh, Gilbert.

1294
01:34:18.944 --> 01:34:22.985
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1295
01:34:28.905 --> 01:34:30.406
Hurry! Hurry!

1296
01:34:30.507 --> 01:34:33.707
You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

1297
01:34:33.826 --> 01:34:35.865
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.

1298
01:34:36.166 --> 01:34:37.066
Hey.

1299
01:34:37.145 --> 01:34:39.166
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here,

1300
01:34:39.176 --> 01:34:41.267
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1301
01:34:41.346 --> 01:34:44.546
You see how this,
the porch is slanted right here?

1302
01:34:44.626 --> 01:34:46.508
I mean, this is
a serious problem, Gilbert.

1303
01:34:46.509 --> 01:34:48.109
We need to get up underneath here,

1304
01:34:48.187 --> 01:34:51.147
first of all, we need to fill this in
so that no more water collects here.

1305
01:34:51.228 --> 01:34:53.987
And then we'll probably...
What?

1306
01:34:59.787 --> 01:35:01.269
- Hi.
- Hi.

1307
01:35:01.349 --> 01:35:03.747
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1308
01:35:05.948 --> 01:35:08.510
- You ready?
- For what?

1309
01:35:09.507 --> 01:35:12.309
I want you to,
I want you to come meet somebody.

1310
01:35:13.829 --> 01:35:15.229
Okay.

1311
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:17.429
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.

1312
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:19.271
- Hi.
- Here's your present.

1313
01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:21.272
Arnie, what do you say?

1314
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:22.869
Thank you!

1315
01:35:28.630 --> 01:35:29.912
Mama?

1316
01:35:32.671 --> 01:35:34.692
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1317
01:35:37.072 --> 01:35:39.752
- No!
- Please?

1318
01:35:42.071 --> 01:35:44.391
- Just this once, for me?
- Gilbert, it's okay.

1319
01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:47.672
- We can do it later.
- No. This is what I want.

1320
01:35:48.792 --> 01:35:50.833
Do it for me, please?

1321
01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:53.391
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1322
01:35:54.072 --> 01:35:56.414
I'm not gonna hurt you
any more, Mama.

1323
01:35:56.794 --> 01:35:58.534
I promise.

1324
01:36:00.192 --> 01:36:01.514
Please.

1325
01:36:05.395 --> 01:36:06.654
Okay.

1326
01:36:07.433 --> 01:36:11.055
Okay.
Becky?

1327
01:36:19.156 --> 01:36:20.936
Mama, this is Becky.

1328
01:36:22.115 --> 01:36:24.696
- Hello.
- Hi.

1329
01:36:31.197 --> 01:36:33.596
I haven't always been like this.

1330
01:36:35.678 --> 01:36:38.398
I haven't always been like this.

1331
01:36:45.278 --> 01:36:47.598
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1332
01:36:47.678 --> 01:36:50.557
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle. I can believe that.

1333
01:36:50.578 --> 01:36:52.399
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1334
01:36:52.478 --> 01:36:55.759
- Uh, bye.
- Goodbye, Arnie.

1335
01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.559
- Bye.
- You take care.

1336
01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:08.440
I had a really nice time.

1337
01:37:10.801 --> 01:37:12.281
I know.

1338
01:37:21.322 --> 01:37:25.121
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "Thank you," Gilbert.

1339
01:37:25.141 --> 01:37:27.122
Say, "Thank you."

1340
01:37:36.122 --> 01:37:37.602
Thank you.

1341
01:37:45.643 --> 01:37:49.404
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye, Arnie.

1342
01:37:49.484 --> 01:37:54.204
It's goodnight. Goodnight...
Goodnight to you, but not me.

1343
01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:56.364
Hey, they're coming!

1344
01:37:56.445 --> 01:37:59.365
Bye! Wait!

1345
01:38:19.066 --> 01:38:20.348
Mama?

1346
01:38:25.486 --> 01:38:27.288
Mama, what are you doing?

1347
01:39:12.692 --> 01:39:15.692
Amy? Amy?

1348
01:39:20.213 --> 01:39:22.131
You rest, Mama.

1349
01:39:23.772 --> 01:39:25.693
You deserve to rest.

1350
01:39:27.814 --> 01:39:30.853
Amy, get me my birthday boy.

1351
01:39:30.933 --> 01:39:32.854
- I want my birthday boy.
- Okay.

1352
01:39:32.934 --> 01:39:36.334
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1353
01:39:36.413 --> 01:39:38.034
Gilbert.

1354
01:39:42.174 --> 01:39:44.494
You're my knight
in shimmering armor.

1355
01:39:44.575 --> 01:39:46.535
Did you know that?

1356
01:39:47.575 --> 01:39:49.535
I think you mean shining.

1357
01:39:50.455 --> 01:39:53.736
No. Shimmering.

1358
01:39:53.896 --> 01:39:56.096
You shimmer and you glow.

1359
01:40:03.016 --> 01:40:07.576
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.

1360
01:40:23.238 --> 01:40:24.259
Hey!

1361
01:40:26.897 --> 01:40:28.579
Mama!

1362
01:40:30.578 --> 01:40:33.219
Mama! Mama!

1363
01:40:33.398 --> 01:40:34.739
Wake up!

1364
01:40:37.459 --> 01:40:39.380
You're hiding, huh?

1365
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.460
I know that.

1366
01:40:46.099 --> 01:40:47.620
Wake up!

1367
01:40:50.141 --> 01:40:54.061
Mama, wake up!

1368
01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:28.304
Mama, stop it now!

1369
01:41:28.383 --> 01:41:30.625
Stop, Mama!

1370
01:41:33.705 --> 01:41:35.425
Stop it.

1371
01:41:41.426 --> 01:41:44.447
Arnie? Arnie?

1372
01:41:46.665 --> 01:41:47.986
What's wrong?

1373
01:41:48.666 --> 01:41:50.687
What's wrong? Stop it!

1374
01:41:51.665 --> 01:41:53.127
Gilbert!

1375
01:41:54.107 --> 01:41:55.727
Gilbert!

1376
01:41:57.387 --> 01:41:59.547
- Arnie!
- Don't, give me stop!

1377
01:42:37.869 --> 01:42:39.052
Mom.

1378
01:42:52.391 --> 01:42:54.272
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1379
01:42:55.833 --> 01:42:58.793
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1380
01:42:59.513 --> 01:43:02.872
<i>You may need the National Guard
to move her out of there.</i>

1381
01:43:02.952 --> 01:43:04.873
I'm sorry about that.

1382
01:43:15.554 --> 01:43:17.954
I-It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1383
01:43:22.234 --> 01:43:24.354
There's gonna be a crowd.

1384
01:43:26.076 --> 01:43:28.436
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1385
01:44:34.781 --> 01:44:36.802
She's so beautiful.

1386
01:44:37.122 --> 01:44:39.681
She's no joke. She's no joke.

1387
01:44:49.002 --> 01:44:50.884
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1388
01:45:11.745 --> 01:45:12.944
Arnie.

1389
01:45:15.384 --> 01:45:17.026
We're gonna need your help.

1390
01:48:22.443 --> 01:48:24.343
Gilbert, is that them?

1391
01:48:24.924 --> 01:48:27.483
No.
No, not yet.

1392
01:48:27.563 --> 01:48:30.543
- When are they gonna come?
- Pretty soon.

1393
01:48:30.723 --> 01:48:32.044
Pretty soon.

1394
01:48:32.924 --> 01:48:35.483
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1395
01:48:36.564 --> 01:48:38.204
Nineteen.

1396
01:48:39.685 --> 01:48:42.404
Gilbert, look there!

1397
01:48:42.423 --> 01:48:44.925
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1398
01:48:45.005 --> 01:48:46.605
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1399
01:48:46.685 --> 01:48:48.925
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1400
01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:51.166
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go, too, and I said,

1401
01:48:51.245 --> 01:48:55.685
well, we can go anywhere
if we want.

1402
01:48:55.765 --> 01:48:58.646
- Becky!
- We can go anywhere.

1403
01:48:58.727 --> 01:49:00.646
Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

1404
01:49:00.726 --> 01:49:02.926
Yep. She's comin'.

1405
01:49:03.006 --> 01:49:05.246
Becky!

1406
01:49:05.326 --> 01:49:07.526
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

1407
01:49:23.849 --> 01:49:25.088
Hey!

1408
01:49:29.889 --> 01:49:31.808
Hi! Hi.

1409
01:49:31.889 --> 01:49:34.449
Hi! Hi!

1410
01:49:35.809 --> 01:49:37.410
- I'm fine.
- Hi!

1411
01:49:37.411 --> 01:49:38.611
How are you?

1412
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:46.001
.
