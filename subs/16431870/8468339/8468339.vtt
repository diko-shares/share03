00:08:05.028 --> 00:08:07.905
[chuckles] I still can't
believe you wanted to kiss me.

167
00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.323
I'll always wanna kiss you.

168
00:08:09.324 --> 00:08:10.324
Aw.

169
00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:11.408
Yeah.

Hey, hey.

173
00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:21.293
That picture you just took, it
was kind of a private moment.

174
00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:23.504
- You mind deleting it?
- Yeah, I do.

175
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:24.923
Hey, come on, man. Don't.

176
00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:29.427
- Don't do that.
- [fairgoer grunts]

177

- Hey, come on. Take it down.
- Ooh.

178
00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:35.558
Take it down.

179
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.684
Make me.

180
00:08:36.685 --> 00:08:38.394
Hey, Dan. Leave it. Let's...

181
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.397
Yeah. Listen to your lady, Dan.

182
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.277
Is there a tough guy
in there, Dan? Hmm?

183
00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:47.112
Are you a tough guy?

184
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.784
Aw. [chuckles]

[breathing heavily]

186
00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:03.378
Hey, tell me.

187
00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:06.339
How'd a loser like him get
a girl as fine as you...

188
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:07.965
probably were?

189
00:09:07.966 --> 00:09:09.717
[fairgoer 1] Oh.

[sighs]

194
00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:23.356
I didn't want you to fight him.

195
00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:27.484
If I wanted to marry
a brawler, I would've.

196
00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:29.946
I know you don't like violence.

197
00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:32.407
It's not like I
care what he said.

198

199
00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:56.305

- I'm so sorry tonight was a bust.

214
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.686
- I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise.
- Oh, it's okay.

215
00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:46.146
- [groans, moans]
- It's okay. [moans]

216
00:10:46.147 --> 00:10:47.232
You know what?

217
00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:50.109
I should have kicked that guy's
ass for what he said to you.

218
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.444
[laughing] Oh, God.

219
00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:54.613
You totally could've
taken him, honey.

Oh, babe.

223
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.372
Sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.

224
00:11:04.082 --> 00:11:05.250
Aw.

225
00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.461
[groans] Can we do
this on Thursday?

226
00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:11.380
I'm so tired.

227
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:12.715
Yeah, sure.

228
00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:15.885
[moans, kisses] I love you.

Remember to block your faces.
You don't wanna lose them.

233
00:11:31.318 --> 00:11:33.319

All right. [grunts]

241
00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.251
I'm so bad at this. I...
[grunts] I usually take barre,

242
00:11:49.252 --> 00:11:50.753
but I couldn't find
one in Buffalo.

243
00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:53.131
No, you're doing great.
Just, uh, keep your fists up.

244
00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:56.008
- Where's home?
- Nowhere, everywhere.

245

246
00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:01.305
Are you here for work?

247
00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:03.057
No, I'm... I'm
here to see my ex.

248
00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:04.516
[instructor] Now swap.

249
00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:05.976
Sorry... [pants] ...TMI.

250
00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:08.312
Don't worry about it. Just
take it out on the bag.

251
00:12:08.313 --> 00:12:10.439
- That's what I do. [grunting]
- [chuckles]

252

About that again.
Ah, how's it feeling?

Mmm, it's, um...

259

- No, it's fine. It's a story.
- [chuckles]

260
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.957
I got beat up by a physical
therapist at the gym.

261

[chuckles] God.

262
00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:30.793
You have a mean right
hook, by the way.

263
00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.002
Oh, thanks.

00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:35.422
[smacks lips] Okay.
So, where were we?

266
00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:36.800
- Three kids...
- Mmm.

Three kids. Yeah.

268
00:12:38.802 --> 00:12:44.473
Yeah. Just when I thought I was sending
one off to college, um, along came Max.

[sighs] I don't know.

272
00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:55.150
I don't know. Sometimes I guess
I just feel like I'm a little...

[inhales deeply] I
don't know, trapped?

274

Hmm.

It's just that, um, Dan,
my hu... my husband,

277
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:06.829
I mean, he's an amazing...
he's an amazing dad, you know?

278
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.166
I guess, uh, he's just
so content being here.

279
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:13.043
- In Buffalo?
- [chuckles]

280
00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:15.004
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

281
00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:16.547
- I didn't mean to... [smacks lips]
- No.

282
00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:18.382
- Say it like that. [sighs]
- That's true.

283
00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:21.468
I mean, when we met, I wanted to
travel. I wanted to see the world.

284
00:13:21.469 --> 00:13:25.180
[inhales deeply] But Dan's... He's
just a total homebody, you know?

285
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.767
He's so focused on the family, and I
do, I love that about him. He's amazing.

convince your husband to travel,

00:15:57.542 --> 00:15:59.961
Th... Thank you for shopping
at Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.

339
00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:05.049
[tires squealing]

340
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.218
[grumbles]

341
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.432
Hold on. [pants]

342
00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.938
Oh. Hey, Beau.

343
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:21.607
- Hey, Dan.
- [pants] Have a good one.

344
00:16:21.608 --> 00:16:22.900
[pants] All right.

345
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.361
[pants]

346
00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:27.447
[panting]

347
00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.838
Shit. The passports
are out of date.

348
00:16:50.595 --> 00:16:52.097
[breathes heavily]

349
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.723
From here on in, Daddy's
paying in cash, Maxie.

350
00:16:54.724 --> 00:16:56.642
[babbles, squeals]

351
00:16:56.643 --> 00:16:57.851
[person 3] <i>Hello?</i>

352
00:16:57.852 --> 00:16:59.728
Hey, don't hang up.

353
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.814
How are you still alive?

354
00:17:01.815 --> 00:17:03.525
Yeah, it's nice to
hear your voice too.

355
00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:07.112
Look, I need new identities.
I'm burned. Full packets.

356
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:09.822
Me, my wife, and three kids.

357
00:17:09.823 --> 00:17:11.948
Three? How did that happen?

358
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:14.118
Do I really need to explain the
birds and the bees right now, Augie,

359
00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.370
or can we talk business?

360
00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.788
Oh, God.

361
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.541
You've got some
nerve calling me.

362
00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.709
McCaffrey scorched the
earth looking for you.

363
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.461
Yep. Looks like he's found me.

364
00:17:24.462 --> 00:17:25.713
- [Augie] <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

365
00:17:25.714 --> 00:17:27.089
Social media, I guess.

366
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.257
<i>You idiot.</i>

367
00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:31.510
- [sighs]
- I had to leave my life behind.

368
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:36.057
Now I'm stuck in Tempe, Arizona, making
fake IDs for entitled college pricks.

369
00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:40.269
- Should I go?
- Oh, no. You can stay.

370
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.147
But given you're trying to look
like you're not in college,

371
00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:44.441
maybe try losing the hoodie?

372
00:17:45.108 --> 00:17:46.067
[mutters indistinctly]

373
00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:47.819
Look, I'll pay you a
half a million in cash.

374
00:17:48.486 --> 00:17:50.846
<i>And you get Doris a condo in
one of those retirement places.</i>

375
00:17:51.281 --> 00:17:53.782
You know, the ones with the golf
carts, the wine and cheese happy hour,

376
00:17:53.783 --> 00:17:54.992
mah-jongg at six o'clock?

377
00:17:54.993 --> 00:17:56.452
Leave my mom out of this.

378
00:17:56.453 --> 00:17:58.746
- <i>Oh, she'll love it.</i>
- I can sell you out for twice that.

379
00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:00.415
Well, you haven't in 18 years.

380
00:18:00.916 --> 00:18:02.918
- Meet me in Vegas in three days.
- [sighs]

381
00:18:05.086 --> 00:18:05.921
[clicks tongue]

382
00:18:05.922 --> 00:18:07.838
I'll give you a time and a
place once I'm on the road.

383
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.506
Vegas? Why Vegas?

384
00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:12.468
I can't tell my wife I'm taking
her on vacation to Tempe, Arizona.

385
00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:13.386
Vegas, I can sell.

386
00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:15.638
You haven't told
them? Are you mental?

387
00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:17.848
What, do you think it's that
easy? What am I meant to do?

388
00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:19.975
Sit them down and tell them the
whole story over French toast?

389
00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:22.561
<i>Oh, hey, kids. You know what?
Pass the maple syrup. By the way,</i>

390
00:18:22.562 --> 00:18:24.605
your dad was a
government assassin.

391
00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:27.126
I'll tell them when I'm on the
road and safe. Three days, Augie.

392
00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:34.032
{\an8}Chess club.

393
00:18:35.533 --> 00:18:36.533
[exhales heavily]

394
00:18:39.955 --> 00:18:41.623
[breathes heavily]
All right, come on.

395
00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:44.625
[tires squeal]

396
00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:46.878
[school bell rings]

397
00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:54.927
Where's Nina? [panting]

398
00:18:54.928 --> 00:18:56.929
Nina's not the editor
anymore. She quit.

399
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.348
What? When?

400
00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:00.099
Three months ago.

401
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.643
So, where is she now?

402
00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:03.769
I don't know.

403
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.937
[sighs] All right, look.

404
00:19:04.938 --> 00:19:07.064
I'll give you 50 bucks for your
best guess of where Nina is.

405
00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:09.608
I'm a journalist. I
don't give people up.

406
00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:10.943
100.

407
00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:12.319
Try under the bleachers. [sighs]

408
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.030
That's what I thought.

409
00:19:20.495 --> 00:19:24.206
I wrote my college essay on how
universities propagate systemic racism,

410
00:19:24.207 --> 00:19:25.416
and my mom shot it down.

411
00:19:25.417 --> 00:19:26.584
- [scoffs]
- I was like, "Hello,

412
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:27.793
that's how change happens."

413
00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:29.837
And she goes, "No, that's how
community college happens."

414
00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:31.506
- [chuckles]
- [Dan] Nina.

415
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.841
Dad, what are you doing here?

416
00:19:33.842 --> 00:19:36.010
This is a safe space. He
can't just come in here.

417
00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:37.095
Your dad's hot.

418
00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:39.805
- Okay, Kelly. That's gross.
- [chuckles]

419
00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:41.307
You're meant to be in
an editorial meeting.

420
00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:43.309
Yeah, I am. I... I was.

421
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.269
- I...
- You quit three months ago.

422
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.521
How could you do that? You
worked so hard to become editor.

423
00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.773
- [scoffs] You don't even read my stuff.
- Of course I do.

424
00:19:49.774 --> 00:19:51.191
- I always do.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

425
00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:53.277
You know what? I don't have time
for this. Where's the chess club?

426
00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:55.362
- We need to find your brother.
- Can't you tell me what's going on?

427
00:19:55.363 --> 00:19:57.364
Nothing. I... I have a
surprise for the family, okay?

428
00:19:57.365 --> 00:19:59.992
- What's the surprise?
- Where is the chess club?

429
00:19:59.993 --> 00:20:02.369
- [sighs]
- It's in the math building.

430
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.080
Thank you, Kelly. [sighs]

431
00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:07.082
- Dad, wait.
- What now?

432
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.960
[sighs] He's not there.

433
00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:18.636
Stay in the car.

434
00:20:18.637 --> 00:20:20.638
Oh, no. Forget it. I
am not missing this.

435
00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:22.557
- Missing what?
- Nothing. [grunts]

436
00:20:23.767 --> 00:20:24.976
[Kyle] Go, go, go, go, go.

437
00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:30.147
- Shit.
- [Dan] Are you Samir?

438
00:20:30.148 --> 00:20:31.983
- Yeah.
- I'm Kyle's dad. Is he here?

439
00:20:33.026 --> 00:20:34.527
[cans clatter]

440
00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:40.282
What happened to chess club?

441
00:20:40.283 --> 00:20:42.076
Um... [stammers] It
was canceled today.

442
00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:44.621
- Right... Right, Samir?
- You don't pay me to lie.

443
00:20:45.163 --> 00:20:47.957
- You pay him?
- No, I... [stammers]

444
00:20:47.958 --> 00:20:50.627
[stammers] Um, you
don't need to... It's...

445
00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:56.298
- I... I can explain.
- [Dan] Get in the car.

446
00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:58.593
- I... [sighs]
- Get in the car.

447
00:20:59.177 --> 00:21:00.177
[Dan] Let's go now.

448
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:03.807
- [chuckles]
- [Kyle] Traitor.

449
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.235
- [Nina] So, what's the big surprise?
- We're going on a trip.

450
00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:18.112
Oh, I actually have plans
this weekend, so I...

451
00:21:18.113 --> 00:21:19.405
You're very grounded,
both of you.

452
00:21:19.406 --> 00:21:20.406
[sighs]

453
00:21:26.496 --> 00:21:27.581
[sighs]

454
00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:31.083
<i>Look, we're going up
there to get your mom.</i>

455
00:21:31.084 --> 00:21:33.377
You two are gonna show her nothing
but excitement for this trip,

456
00:21:33.378 --> 00:21:35.129
or I'm gonna tell her that
you've been lying to us,

457
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.756
and you know how
that's gonna go down.

458
00:21:37.382 --> 00:21:38.674
Where are we even going?

459
00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:39.759
[mother] <i>Vegas?</i>

460
00:21:40.343 --> 00:21:42.803
- We're going to Las Vegas today?
- Well, you said you wanted...

461
00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.138
- Now?
- To be more spontaneous.

462
00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:46.140
I heard you. And Jorge said
I could take a few days off.

463
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:47.933
- Is Jorge the one that does...
- [Kyle grunting]

464
00:21:47.934 --> 00:21:50.978
- hydromassages on Tuesdays?
- No, Mrs. Kessler. Jorge is Dan's boss.

465
00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:54.857
- Is Dan giving me a hydromassage?
- No, Mrs. Kessler.

466
00:21:54.858 --> 00:21:56.108
There's no massages today.

467
00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:58.235
No. The kids have a long weekend,
and they're pumped. Right, guys?

468
00:21:58.236 --> 00:22:00.697
Guys, tell your mom how
pumped you are for this trip.

469
00:22:01.573 --> 00:22:03.575
- Whoo! Yes!
- Oh, so pumped.

470
00:22:04.075 --> 00:22:06.493
Dan, we can't just
up and go to Vegas.

471
00:22:06.494 --> 00:22:08.370
I mean... And why Vegas?

472
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:12.291
I know it's not Europe, but there's
a Venice and an Eiffel Tower.

473
00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:14.877
You know what? I bet you we can
get last-minute Adele tickets.

474
00:22:14.878 --> 00:22:16.587
- You love Adele.
- [sighs deeply] You love Adele.

475
00:22:16.588 --> 00:22:18.339
Of course I love Adele.
Who doesn't love Adele?

476
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.216
- I love Adele.
- Everybody loves Adele.

477
00:22:20.217 --> 00:22:22.051
She's got the voice
of a freaking angel.

478
00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:24.511
Come on, Jess. What
is holding us back?

479
00:22:24.512 --> 00:22:27.681
Who are you? I mean, I don't
even recognize you. [chuckles]

480
00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:29.850
Well, you're gonna love
him. He's crazy in bed.

481
00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:31.227
- Oh. Oh.
- [gasps] Ooh.

482
00:22:31.228 --> 00:22:32.853
Are you sure it's not Tuesday?

483
00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:35.856
You deserve a break. And I think this
could be really good for us as a family.

484
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:37.608
And we're driving there?

485
00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:39.809
Well, nothing brings a family
together like a road trip.

486
00:22:41.363 --> 00:22:43.489
But we gotta go now. [stammers]
Before the traffic gets bad.

487
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.116
And Mrs. Kessler, I'm so sorry. You
keep working on those deltoids, okay?

488
00:22:46.117 --> 00:22:48.077
- Thanks, Jorge.
- What about our stuff?

489
00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:50.454
- I mean, I need to pack, the baby. It's...
- Oh, no, no, no.

490
00:22:50.455 --> 00:22:52.581
I got all the basics packed
already. Yeah. When we get there,

491
00:22:52.582 --> 00:22:55.167
we're gonna use the money that we
saved on flights to go all <i>Pretty Woman</i>

492
00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:56.585
- in those fancy hotel boutiques...
- [sighs]

493
00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:58.379
- that smell like leather and patchouli.
- Stop.

494
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.714
And guess who's got no budget?
You get whatever you want.

495
00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:01.924
[exhales heavily]

496
00:23:01.925 --> 00:23:05.052
[sighs deeply] Okay. Oh,
this is totally crazy.

497
00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:06.637
- Dan, this is crazy.
- I know. It's crazy.

498
00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:07.930
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna get crazy.

499
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:09.474
We're going to Vegas!

500
00:23:10.642 --> 00:23:11.850
[Jess] Do we have snacks?

501
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.227
[Dan] Let's just get
out there on the road,

502
00:23:13.228 --> 00:23:14.896
and then we can
make a stop and...

503
00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:22.945
I think I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Save us a little bit of time.

504
00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:24.364
[Jess] What?

505
00:23:29.494 --> 00:23:30.537
Go, go, go!

506
00:23:31.538 --> 00:23:33.872
- Whoa. Shit.
- It's a shortcut. You never take Elmwood?

507
00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:34.873
- Shit.
- [giggles]

508
00:23:43.508 --> 00:23:44.718
[Dan] All right. We're off.

509
00:23:49.222 --> 00:23:50.932
[Max babbling]

510
00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:53.143
Hey, Maxie.

511
00:23:53.727 --> 00:23:54.977
- First road trip.
- Yeah.

512
00:23:54.978 --> 00:23:57.897
[chuckles] Max, you excited?

513
00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:01.066
Five hours on a plane,
or 33 hours in a car?

514
00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:02.234
I choose 33 hours.

515
00:24:02.235 --> 00:24:04.279
- [babbles]
- [Jess] Da!

516
00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:13.871
Honey, you remembered my boots!

517
00:24:13.872 --> 00:24:15.748
- Yeah.
- Baby!

518
00:24:15.749 --> 00:24:16.917
I can't believe that.

519
00:24:23.256 --> 00:24:25.633
- [Jess] Whoa. Jesus.
- Oh, my God. Jesus. Dad.

520
00:24:25.634 --> 00:24:27.426
- Easy there, lead-foot.
- Sorry about that.

521
00:24:27.427 --> 00:24:29.136
Think a squirrel or something
jumped out in front of me.

522
00:24:29.137 --> 00:24:30.471
[babbles]

523
00:24:30.472 --> 00:24:31.513
[tires squealing]

524
00:24:31.514 --> 00:24:33.224
Oh, my God.

525
00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:36.143
- Where on earth are you taking us?
- What? Oh, no. This is a shortcut, honey.

526
00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:37.437
You never take it?

527
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.189
Shit.

528
00:24:43.568 --> 00:24:44.777
He's tracking us.

529
00:24:44.778 --> 00:24:46.445
- [Jess] Huh?
- Oh, nothing.

530
00:24:46.446 --> 00:24:47.572
Nothing, honey.

531
00:24:48.448 --> 00:24:50.158
[laptop beeping]

532
00:24:56.831 --> 00:24:58.749
Uh, you know what? Actually,
I... I gotta... [sighs]

533
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.590
stop and check something
at work real quick.

534
00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:08.259
[remote beeps]

535
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.222
- Is that Hal?
- [Dan] Yeah. He's got a new mustache.

536
00:25:13.223 --> 00:25:15.543
- You work with that guy?
- [Dan] It will just be a second.

537
00:25:20.647 --> 00:25:22.367
I think there's a service
area to the right.

538
00:25:32.284 --> 00:25:35.829
All right. If you guys just give
me a second, I'll be right there.

539
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.628
- Dad, what the hell?
- Language, Nina.

540
00:25:44.754 --> 00:25:46.088
Dan, what the hell?

541
00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:47.673
Oh, well, we're
driving 2,000 miles.

542
00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:49.593
We've gotta change the
oil, check the coolant,

543
00:25:50.844 --> 00:25:52.094
pop a little extra
air in the tires.

544
00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.889
I'd hate to be halfway across the desert
and wish we'd checked that coolant, right?

545
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.017
Can we not be in the car for it?

546
00:26:01.563 --> 00:26:03.522
Okay, he's stopped.
He's right ahead of us.

547
00:26:03.523 --> 00:26:05.233
[tools whirring]

548
00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:15.452
[grunts]

549
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.546
[tracker] He should be here.

550
00:26:34.221 --> 00:26:37.181
[sighs] Hey, guys. Just, uh,
ha... hang in there for a minute.

551
00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:38.266
[Jess] Dan?

552
00:26:39.226 --> 00:26:40.809
[Kyle] Mom, when we're in Vegas,

553
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.479
- can I go to HyperX?
- No, you're not going to a strip club.

554
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.064
- It's not a strip club.
- Why are you laughing?

555
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:46.273
- You're not gambling, Nina.
- [chuckles]

556
00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:47.816
- Do you have a fake ID?
- I... I'm not... I'm not being... No.

557
00:26:47.817 --> 00:26:49.151
- Dan!
- [pop music playing]

558
00:26:49.152 --> 00:26:51.779
[Dan] Hey, Hal. Nice wheels.

559
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.113
- She just come in?
- Yeah.

560
00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:54.865
I was thinking about
opening her up a little bit.

561
00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:58.160
Oh, man. I tell you what.
She wants to go fast.

562
00:26:58.161 --> 00:26:59.328
Cars are like chicks, man.

563
00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:01.664
- Yes! Right.
- Get her on the freeway.

564
00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:03.792
You open her up. And you
get a ticket, it's on me.

565
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:11.675
Oh, I got him. He's on the
move. He's heading west.

566
00:27:16.596 --> 00:27:17.680
Hey, guys.

567
00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:18.847
- Yes?
- [Dan] We're ready.

568
00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:21.101
Are we going to Vegas, or are
we just gonna live up here?

569
00:27:21.685 --> 00:27:23.770
- We're on our way, honey. [chuckles]

["Ready Set Go" playing]

571
00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:53.758
- Honey, aren't your feet cold?
- I don't care. I am on vacation.

572
00:27:54.843 --> 00:27:55.843
What are you doing?

573
00:27:55.844 --> 00:27:57.387
[chuckles] I'm posting
about our trip.

574
00:27:58.305 --> 00:28:00.598
Look, do we really need to be
posting and tweeting and TikToking?

575
00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:01.974
In my day, road trips were
all about interaction.

576
00:28:01.975 --> 00:28:04.059
No, Dad. Please. I can't deal
with a dad lecture right now.

577
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.645
You literally don't even know how to
text, so your opinion doesn't count.

578
00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:08.647
I'm serious. This should be
a device-free vacation, okay?

579
00:28:08.648 --> 00:28:09.732
Give them up, now.

580
00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:10.983
- Wh... What?
- [Dan] Seriously.

581
00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:12.443
- [Jess] What?
- Give it up. Now.

00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:15.947
- Jess, a little help?
- Okay, you heard him. Hand 'em over.

- [Nina] No, no, no. Dad.

- No way you just did that. What?
- Oh, my God, Dad.

from the shackles of technology

- with a flick of my wrist. Just like that.
- [Kyle] Stop the car.

592
00:28:39.471 --> 00:28:42.556
And trust me, it's gonna bring us
all closer together. Just you wait.

You've lost your mind.

- Whatever. I'll just buy myself a new one.

- Oh, yeah.

- Look. At least they're talking.

- about all your business endeavors?
- I don't give a...

I've got a question for
you, Mr. Spontaneous.

Without our phones, how are we
gonna know where we're going?

601

If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

602
00:29:00.742 --> 00:29:03.452
It's not a joke. We're going on
a family road trip. We need maps.

you know... [imitates beeping]

Yeah, Dad. Why?

605
00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:11.794
Because he was trying to
promote familial bonding...

606
00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:12.878
- [Jess] Mm-hmm.
- Through the forcible

I'm also going to need help
with some reservations,

613
00:29:26.518 --> 00:29:28.728

an inconvenience for you.

- You know what? Here's my membership card.

a few rewards points there.

really how it works.

- It's like a whole thing.
- Oh, I get it.

don't even need a credit card.

- Do I know you?
- [stammers] I don't think so.

667
00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:10.473
Well, yeah. I've
seen you on Twitch.

668
00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:13.934
You're the guy who took down
Synapse live on his own stream!

669
00:32:13.935 --> 00:32:15.353
You're Kyllboi. Right?

670
00:32:16.354 --> 00:32:17.855
[stammers] You know about that?

671
00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:19.940
Yeah. Dude, that was badass.

672
00:32:19.941 --> 00:32:21.275
- Um...
- Can I get a picture?

673
00:32:21.276 --> 00:32:24.278
- Um, uh, sure.
- [chuckles]

know how to tell you this,

675
00:32:27.407 --> 00:32:30.409

we're not coming home.

I haven't been completely hon...

677
00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:36.874
[inhales shakily] The
truth is, when we met...

678
00:32:36.875 --> 00:32:38.460
- [toilet flushes]
- Before I met...

679
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.009
All right, here we go.
We've got rooms 152 and 153.

680
00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:49.261
Oh, can I get, uh, four of those
disposable cameras too, please?

681
00:32:49.262 --> 00:32:50.347
Yeah.

682
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:52.556
Here you go.

683
00:32:52.557 --> 00:32:54.559
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

dude. For real.

685
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.857
[chuckles] I mean, thank you.

686
00:33:01.858 --> 00:33:04.360
I mean, this is... this is literally
the worst ever... [chuckles]

- [Jess] I'm gonna get you.

688
00:33:05.946 --> 00:33:07.071
[gasps] I'm gonna get you!

689
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.906
[Dan] All right. Here,
kiddo. Go make some memories.

690
00:33:08.907 --> 00:33:11.283
Yeah, I'm... I don't know, this is...
It's just a weird experience for me.

691
00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:13.953
- [fan] That's so cool I ran into you.
- Look at your brother. He's made a friend.

692
00:33:13.954 --> 00:33:15.579
- [fan] Uh, can you do the thing?
- Uh, yeah.

693
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.998
[shutter clicking]

694
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.100
- Awesome. Thanks, Kyllboi.
- Thank you.

695
00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:22.545
- Hey, what was all this about?
- That's a really good question.

696
00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:24.964
- What was that about?
- Yeah, and who's Kyllboi?

697
00:33:24.965 --> 00:33:26.465
- [Kyle] Um...
- [Nina] You know, that sounds familiar.

698
00:33:26.466 --> 00:33:27.883
I feel like I know who that is.

699
00:33:27.884 --> 00:33:29.385
- That's... [stammers]
- [stammers] No one.

700
00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:30.844
- It's nothing.
- Oh, my God.

701
00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:32.137
- It's not important.
- He's Kyllboi.

702
00:33:32.138 --> 00:33:34.348
It's his gamer tag.
He never quit gaming.

703
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:36.308
He thinks he's, like,
famous or something now.

704
00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:37.476
- [Max babbles]
- Really?

705
00:33:37.477 --> 00:33:39.937
- Big boy! [gasping]
- Da.

706
00:33:39.938 --> 00:33:42.147
- [gasping] Da?
- Is she gonna post that picture?

707
00:33:42.148 --> 00:33:44.650
- Um, prob... probably, yeah.
- [Jess] Hey!

708
00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:46.152
Did you get some rooms?

709
00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:48.946
Uh, no. They're all booked.
We gotta keep going.

710
00:33:48.947 --> 00:33:50.365

- [Dan] Yeah.

Oh, my God. Did you just
say we're in Iowa City?

750

- Oh, my God.
- [Dan] Yes, honey.

751
00:37:51.648 --> 00:37:54.066
That means we're like... we're
literally, like, half an inch from SIU.

stop and see Trevor, okay?

755

I meant that I wanted to
see campus, but whatever.

756
00:38:01.241 --> 00:38:03.659
Oh. Right. 'Cause you're really
interested in seeing the facilities.

- Yeah. Actually, I am.
- Are you serious?

Are we gonna argue about this? About
you following a boy to college?

- Guys.

go for three months...

- Guys.
- It's the college that I want to go to.

762
00:38:12.836 --> 00:38:14.295
Obviously, I would want
to go see the campus.

763

- [Jess] Why do you wanna go?
- [Nina] We're so far from home.

00:38:16.923 --> 00:38:18.507
This place is gorgeous.

765
00:38:18.508 --> 00:38:20.301
How could you not
want me to come here?

766
00:38:20.302 --> 00:38:25.431
[scoffs, chuckles] I cannot believe
that you are encouraging this.

Look, it wouldn't hurt for us
to be off the road for a bit.

768
00:38:27.517 --> 00:38:30.185
Besides, I mean, maybe if
we want her to listen to us,

769
00:38:30.186 --> 00:38:31.937
we gotta start
listening to her more.

770

- Let her look around. It's safe, nice.
- Mmm.

give us a chance to talk.

you how to do a keg stand?

we were a part of the group all along.

- [Dan] Yeah.

We're here to
support your sister.

820

If you're questioning that,
you get to strap on Max.

821

- Let's go.
- Next up,

822
00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:58.126

state-of-the-art athletic facilities.

I ratted you out.

It's just, it drives me crazy
that you get away with so much,

825
00:41:04.216 --> 00:41:07.551
and I get yelled at constantly just
because you guys don't get Trevor.

826

827

- We don't like Trevor.
- Why?

828
00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:14.713
Ever since you've been dating him, you've
been like a completely different person.

829
00:41:16.019 --> 00:41:17.354
I liked you better before.

830
00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:20.232

like shit. You deserve more.

Is that... Is that, like,
genuine concern for my feelings?

832
00:41:27.113 --> 00:41:29.699
- No. God, no. Gross.
- [laughs]

833
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.911
- I wonder what's going on in your mind.
- [laughs]

834
00:41:33.912 --> 00:41:35.663
It's just... I don't know.

835
00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:37.916
Another blast from the past.

836
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.001
Oh. You think you
can still do it?

837
00:41:40.502 --> 00:41:44.089
No. Not unless I wanted
to end up in the hospital.

838
00:41:44.798 --> 00:41:48.342
It's just... [inhales sharply] It's funny
to think how different my life would be

839
00:41:48.343 --> 00:41:50.469
if I hadn't torn my ACL.

840
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.222
- Well, do you want it to be different?
- No. God, no.

841
00:41:53.223 --> 00:41:55.849
It's just... [inhales sharply]
You know, it's just strange.

842
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.810
You've never even met
that version of me.

843
00:41:57.811 --> 00:42:00.479
You just know Jessica,
the physical therapist.

844
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.064
Well, I love every
version of you.

845
00:42:02.065 --> 00:42:04.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Especially that keg stand one.

846
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:05.776
- It was so freaking hot.
- [laughs]

847
00:42:05.777 --> 00:42:07.654
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.

848
00:42:08.572 --> 00:42:10.614
Did you ever have sex
on the pole-vault mat?

849
00:42:10.615 --> 00:42:12.659
[gasps] Uh...

850
00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:15.954
- Don't answer that. Oh, my.
- [chuckles] God.

851
00:42:16.746 --> 00:42:19.832
You have been acting so
weird this whole trip.

852
00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:22.668
But I gotta tell you, I'm
kind of into spontaneous Dan.

853
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:26.088
Well, you know, Jess. I mean, we all
have different versions of ourselves.

854
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:27.632
- And sometimes, you just...
- Yeah.

855
00:42:28.216 --> 00:42:30.009
- That guy with the gold chain.
- Um...

856
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.803
He wasn't with the group before.

857
00:42:32.554 --> 00:42:33.888
- Okay.
- What's he doing?

858
00:42:33.889 --> 00:42:35.015
[stammers]

859
00:42:35.849 --> 00:42:37.517
[Gold Chain speaks German]

860
00:42:38.393 --> 00:42:40.562
Well, they grow up fast,
huh? Which one is yours?

861
00:42:41.313 --> 00:42:43.440
My daughter is
back in Stuttgart.

862
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.484
- I look at school for her.
- Wow. That's a hike.

863
00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:48.485
[Gold Chain] I
have business here.

864
00:42:48.486 --> 00:42:51.405
[tour guide] Chemistry,
astronomy, astrophysics...

865
00:42:51.406 --> 00:42:53.325
Hey, you mentioned
having business in Iowa.

866
00:42:53.825 --> 00:42:55.118
What business would that be?

867
00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:57.578
- Corn.
- Yeah?

868
00:42:57.579 --> 00:42:58.871
That's what's in the case?

869
00:42:58.872 --> 00:42:59.955
[in German] Of course.

870
00:42:59.956 --> 00:43:02.499
[in English] Oh. Ladies.

871
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.667
[group member] Thanks.

872
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:05.921
- After you.
- No, I insist.

873
00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:09.340
- Dan?
- Oh. Hey, honey.

874
00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:10.300
- Coming?
- Yeah.

875
00:43:10.301 --> 00:43:12.760
I'm just getting to know this fella here.
All the way from Stuttgart, Germany.

876
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:14.011
- Oh.
- You know, I had a pen pal

877
00:43:14.012 --> 00:43:15.596
from Stuttgart back
in high school.

878
00:43:15.597 --> 00:43:17.389
I even learned a little German.

879
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.642
[in German] Nobody
needs to know.

880
00:43:19.643 --> 00:43:22.394
If you want to speak
about what's in the case,

881
00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:24.189
it will stay between us.

882
00:43:25.023 --> 00:43:27.441
[laughing, in English]
What did you just say?

883
00:43:27.442 --> 00:43:28.609
"Where's the discotheque?"

884
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.986
[laughs] Right. Okay. [laughs]

885
00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:32.655
Don't worry, honey.
We'll catch up, okay?

886
00:43:32.656 --> 00:43:34.937
- [Jess] All right, honey.
- [in German] Goodbye, my love.

887
00:43:36.368 --> 00:43:37.910
[laughs]

888
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:39.495
[in English] Fine.
You wanna dance.

889
00:43:39.496 --> 00:43:41.081
Let's see what's in the case.

890
00:43:45.627 --> 00:43:47.711
- What the hell is that?
- Heirloom corn.

891
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:49.214
I thought I made this clear.

892
00:43:49.839 --> 00:43:51.882
So, you're just German?

893
00:43:51.883 --> 00:43:53.343
[in German] Yes, exactly.

894
00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:55.594
[in English] Oh, shit. [grunts]

895
00:43:55.595 --> 00:43:56.638
[grunts]

896
00:44:14.322 --> 00:44:16.032
[both grunting]

897
00:44:18.076 --> 00:44:19.243
- [grunts]
- [groans]

898
00:44:19.244 --> 00:44:21.954
- Biology labs are over there.
- Where's Dad?

899
00:44:21.955 --> 00:44:25.035
- [tour guide] Physics labs are down there.
- He's talking to some German guy.

900
00:44:26.251 --> 00:44:28.168
We have our chemistry
labs right here.

901
00:44:28.169 --> 00:44:29.713
[grunts]

902
00:44:30.422 --> 00:44:33.716
- [groans]
- [blinds clatter]

903
00:44:33.717 --> 00:44:36.427
Never a dull moment in the
labs. [laughs] Moving on.

904
00:44:36.428 --> 00:44:37.511
Let me show you

905
00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:40.055
the biggest Van de Graaff
generator in the Midwest.

906
00:44:40.056 --> 00:44:42.183
[Jess] Mmm.

907
00:44:43.518 --> 00:44:45.061
[Dan groans]

908
00:44:47.063 --> 00:44:48.063
[pants]

909
00:44:49.316 --> 00:44:50.608
[grunts, groans]

910
00:44:50.609 --> 00:44:52.569
[groans]

911
00:44:55.238 --> 00:44:57.407
[groaning]

912
00:45:06.333 --> 00:45:07.542
[screams]

913
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.926
[grunting, groaning]

914
00:45:33.902 --> 00:45:34.902
[breathes heavily]

915
00:45:43.745 --> 00:45:46.914
[tour guide] So, I hope you've all
enjoyed this tour of our wonderful campus.

916
00:45:46.915 --> 00:45:48.749
I know I have.

917
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.709
- Hey. It's getting late, huh?
- Hey.

918
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.503
- We should probably get back on the road.
- Yeah.

919
00:45:52.504 --> 00:45:55.839
- Where's Nina?
- Oh. I said she could go say hi to Trevor.

920
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.466
It felt cruel to deny her.

921
00:45:57.467 --> 00:45:59.343
[breathes deeply] It's okay.

922
00:45:59.344 --> 00:46:00.427
She'll be back soon.

923
00:46:00.428 --> 00:46:02.764
- [babbles]
- Yeah. No. I-I'm not worried at all.

924
00:46:09.229 --> 00:46:11.314
[breathes shakily] Okay.

925
00:46:13.358 --> 00:46:14.609
[Trevor] Go away, Josh.

926
00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:16.819
It's me.

927
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.280
[laughs, stammers] Me who?

928
00:46:19.114 --> 00:46:20.824
- Uh, Nina.
- [whispers] Oh.

929
00:46:23.076 --> 00:46:25.327
Hey. What are you doing here?

930
00:46:25.328 --> 00:46:26.912
[stammers] It's, like,
a really long story.

931
00:46:26.913 --> 00:46:28.455
- But, um, can I come in?
- [chuckles]

932
00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:30.082
[stammers] You know what?

933
00:46:30.083 --> 00:46:32.543
Give me just one sec, and
I'll throw on some pants,

934
00:46:32.544 --> 00:46:34.212
and me and you
can grab a matcha.

935
00:46:35.714 --> 00:46:38.048
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- [chuckles]

936
00:46:38.049 --> 00:46:39.508
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on a second.

937
00:46:39.509 --> 00:46:43.262
Oh, my God. You're...
You're cheating on me.

938
00:46:43.263 --> 00:46:47.641
[stammers] Monogamy is just a construct
of our Western repressive civilization.

939
00:46:47.642 --> 00:46:48.726
[Nina] Oh, my God.

940
00:46:48.727 --> 00:46:51.979
[Trevor stammers] I thought we
were on the same page on that.

941
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.064
[Jess] All right.

942
00:46:53.857 --> 00:46:54.940
Honey, what happened?

943
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:56.860
He's an asshole.
That's what happened.

944
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.862
"Monogamy is just a
construct"... Who even says that?

945
00:46:59.863 --> 00:47:01.363
- Trevor.
- [sighs] Oh, baby. I'm so sorry.

946
00:47:01.364 --> 00:47:02.781
Can we just go?

947
00:47:02.782 --> 00:47:04.492
Ah, that's a great
idea, honey. Let's go.

948
00:47:07.329 --> 00:47:09.163
[sobbing]

949
00:47:09.164 --> 00:47:10.248
Hey, Beans.

950
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:14.126
Look, I'm sorry. [stammers] You
know, when I was your age, I...

951
00:47:14.127 --> 00:47:15.211
[sobs]

952
00:47:15.212 --> 00:47:16.921
You don't need another
dad lecture, do you?

953
00:47:16.922 --> 00:47:19.257
[breathing heavily]

954
00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:22.135
Hey, Beans.

955
00:47:23.553 --> 00:47:25.429
You ever hear of Kyusho Jitsu?

956
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.514
- Kyusho what? [breathes heavily]
- Kyusho Jitsu.

957
00:47:27.515 --> 00:47:30.809
It's a 13th-century martial
art that uses pressure points

958
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.437
to inflict extreme pain
without permanent damage.

959
00:47:33.438 --> 00:47:35.190
[stammers] How do you
even know about that?

960
00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:38.652
Well, maybe there's more to
your old man than you thought.

961
00:47:41.279 --> 00:47:42.614
[inhales sharply]

962
00:47:43.907 --> 00:47:46.909
Nina, you gotta let go
of these stereotypical...

963
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.494
[groans, cries]

964
00:47:48.495 --> 00:47:50.162
[screaming]

965
00:47:50.163 --> 00:47:51.622
[groans, crying]

966
00:47:51.623 --> 00:47:53.916
[Nina] How was that
for "stereotypical,"

967
00:47:53.917 --> 00:48:00.297
you unbearably pompous, bloviating
piece of sanctimonious shit?

968
00:48:00.298 --> 00:48:02.049
[crying, groaning]

969
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.134
- Smile.
- [shutter clicks]

970
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:06.136
You deserve more.

971
00:48:06.137 --> 00:48:07.597
[Trevor groaning]

972
00:48:08.181 --> 00:48:09.182
[Nina cackles]

973
00:48:17.482 --> 00:48:18.483
[chuckles]

974
00:48:19.234 --> 00:48:20.277
[Max babbles]

975
00:48:20.902 --> 00:48:23.612
- What did you say to her?
- It was just a dad lecture.

976
00:48:23.613 --> 00:48:26.616
- [groans] God. [sighs]
- [groans]

977
00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:40.504
What happened to the mirror?

978
00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:41.464
Huh?

979
00:48:41.465 --> 00:48:42.548
[Jess] The mirror.

980
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:44.133
Oh. You didn't hear that?

981
00:48:44.134 --> 00:48:45.217
- No.
- Oh.

982
00:48:45.218 --> 00:48:48.220
It was a semi. It went flying by. The
guy must have been doing a hundred.

983
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:49.513
And rocks just come...

984
00:48:49.514 --> 00:48:50.806
- [stammers] ...spitting out of the tire.
- [Jess] Jesus.

985
00:48:50.807 --> 00:48:52.976
One hit there. It almost
hit the windshield.

986
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.033
- [bag pops]
- What the...

987
00:49:09.034 --> 00:49:10.493
[laughing]

988
00:49:12.537 --> 00:49:13.537
We got him.

989
00:49:13.538 --> 00:49:14.747
We really got you.

990
00:49:14.748 --> 00:49:16.666
- You were so scared.
- [kids laughing]

991
00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:44.402
So, did you, um... did you
tell Mom that I quit the paper?

992
00:49:47.113 --> 00:49:48.323
No. Did you want me to?

993
00:49:50.325 --> 00:49:51.408
I was kidding.

994
00:49:51.409 --> 00:49:52.827
[laughs] No. I... I...

995
00:49:53.453 --> 00:49:57.582
I was just kind of thinking about
maybe getting my position back.

996
00:49:59.626 --> 00:50:02.504
Yeah? That's cool.

997
00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:04.839
[stammers] Only do
it if you want to.

998
00:50:05.882 --> 00:50:07.133
I gotta tell you, Beans.

999
00:50:07.926 --> 00:50:10.470
You've got a hell of a voice,
and it deserves to be heard.

1000
00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:15.474
Hey. No BS. All right?

1001
00:50:15.475 --> 00:50:17.768
I'm serious. That piece you
wrote about pervasive corruption

1002
00:50:17.769 --> 00:50:20.062
in the Board of Education...
[inhales sharply] My God.

1003
00:50:20.063 --> 00:50:21.855
I got chills. [sighs]

1004
00:50:21.856 --> 00:50:23.190
[stammers] You
actually read that?

1005
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:24.526
Of course I did.

1006
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.111
Come on. I'm your
biggest fan, Beans.

1007
00:50:27.112 --> 00:50:29.030
Always have been,
and I always will be.

1008
00:50:29.948 --> 00:50:31.074
And so is your mom.

1009
00:50:32.075 --> 00:50:33.285
And so are your brothers.

1010
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.495
Max just hasn't told you yet.

1011
00:50:38.748 --> 00:50:39.915
Oh, a smile.

1012
00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:41.375
Wow. Holy shit.

1013
00:50:41.376 --> 00:50:43.586
- Oh, my God.
- [laughs] No, I didn't.

1014
00:50:43.587 --> 00:50:45.462
- That was... No.
- [Dan chuckles]

1015
00:50:45.463 --> 00:50:47.215
I mean it. I'm proud of you.

1016
00:50:48.508 --> 00:50:49.509
Thanks.

1017
00:51:03.023 --> 00:51:05.901
Mmm. Max is fed and
settled in the kids' room.

1018
00:51:06.484 --> 00:51:08.403
I am so ready for a real bed.

1019
00:51:13.325 --> 00:51:14.367
What?

1020
00:51:16.828 --> 00:51:17.828
Nothing.

1021
00:51:22.792 --> 00:51:24.084
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

1022
00:51:24.085 --> 00:51:25.545
- Hey now.
- Hey.

1023
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:27.422
You wanna lose that?

1024
00:51:29.341 --> 00:51:30.841
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1025
00:51:30.842 --> 00:51:33.052
Oh. Wait.

1026
00:51:33.053 --> 00:51:35.347
[breathes heavily]
It's not Thursday.

1027
00:51:36.181 --> 00:51:37.932
[breathes heavily]

1028
00:51:37.933 --> 00:51:40.559
Mmm. [moans] Mmm. Okay.

1029
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.645
[grunts]

1030
00:51:42.145 --> 00:51:45.147
[moans, breathing heavily]

1031
00:51:45.148 --> 00:51:48.859
Fuck. [moans, sighs]

1032
00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.903
- Mmm. [breathing heavily]
- [moaning]

1033
00:51:50.904 --> 00:51:53.031
- [sighs]
- [sighs] Wow.

1034
00:51:53.531 --> 00:51:55.200
- [groans]
- What was that?

1035
00:51:55.700 --> 00:52:00.287
[chuckles] Oh, that felt
like... That felt...

1036
00:52:00.288 --> 00:52:02.915
[sighs] That was long overdue.

1037
00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:05.209
That was... [whimpers, laughs]

1038
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.795
- That's what that was.
- That felt, uh...

1039
00:52:07.796 --> 00:52:08.713
Mmm. [kisses]

1040
00:52:08.714 --> 00:52:10.381
[sighs] That felt different.

1041
00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:12.175
- Different good, I hope.
- Different like...

1042
00:52:12.884 --> 00:52:15.344
I was cheating on
Dan with other Dan.

1043
00:52:15.345 --> 00:52:19.390
- Whoa! That different. Oh. Mmm.
- [laughs] No. I mean... No. It was...

1044
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:22.394
Don't get me wrong. That
was so hot. That was like...

1045
00:52:23.687 --> 00:52:24.980
What got into you?

1046
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:27.481
I don't know.

1047
00:52:27.482 --> 00:52:29.150
Maybe it's being away, or...

1048
00:52:30.443 --> 00:52:34.780
maybe it was seeing you upside-down
on that keg shouting, "Beer me!"

1049
00:52:34.781 --> 00:52:35.865
[laughs]

1050
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:42.247
Is this what you
used to be like?

1051
00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:44.249
Other Dan.

1052
00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:47.168
Did you change because of me?

1053
00:52:49.796 --> 00:52:50.797
No.

1054
00:52:52.007 --> 00:52:56.344
Look, I changed because I
didn't like who I was back then.

1055
00:52:57.262 --> 00:52:58.513
Then I met you.

1056
00:53:00.056 --> 00:53:01.266
Then I became a dad.

1057
00:53:01.975 --> 00:53:05.312
[inhales sharply] And for the first
time in a long time, I felt good.

1058
00:53:05.896 --> 00:53:07.479
I just took it too far.

1059
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.023
- I got too comfortable. Too safe.
- Mmm.

1060
00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:11.609
- And that probably came across as boring...
- Well...

1061
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.027
- and maybe neglectful...
- for what it's worth...

1062
00:53:13.028 --> 00:53:16.071
- and I'll never do that again.
- I really like both Dans.

1063
00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:17.489
- Do you?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1064
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:18.824
Well, I'm already here, so...

1065
00:53:18.825 --> 00:53:23.412
- Mmm. How convenient. [laughs]
- Yeah.

1066
00:53:23.413 --> 00:53:24.497
[phone ringing]

1067
00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:30.127
- Hello?
- [Dan] <i>Augie? We're on track tonight.</i>

1068
00:53:30.128 --> 00:53:32.213
Aria bar, 6:00 p.m. Do
you have everything?

1069
00:53:32.214 --> 00:53:34.965
Some of my finest
work. If I may say so.

1070
00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:37.727
What, better than that passport that
got me cavity searched in Bogotá?

1071
00:53:39.512 --> 00:53:41.680
You're never gonna let
me forget that, are you?

1072
00:53:41.681 --> 00:53:44.183
Yeah, sure. The day I forget
the snap of that latex glove.

1073
00:53:44.184 --> 00:53:45.559
<i>Have you told them yet?</i>

1074
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.644
I'm working on it, all right?

1075
00:53:46.645 --> 00:53:48.979
It's not exactly easy to
work into a conversation.

1076
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.522
You know, they might
think that something is up

1077
00:53:50.523 --> 00:53:52.775
when they have to change their
name and leave the country.

1078
00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:54.318
What are you waiting for?

1079
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:57.197
I said I'm working on it, Augie.
All right? Give me a break.

1080
00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:00.408
[bells on door jingling]

1081
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:10.293
Look, Jess. [exhales deeply]

1082
00:54:11.253 --> 00:54:13.046
There's something that
I need to tell you.

1083
00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:15.881
About the other Dan.

1084
00:54:15.882 --> 00:54:18.884
[sighs] The Dan I
was before we met.

1085
00:54:18.885 --> 00:54:21.388
Dad? Who you talking to?

1086
00:54:22.138 --> 00:54:23.223
Nobody. Sit down.

1087
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.601
Girls aren't ready yet.

1088
00:54:28.853 --> 00:54:30.938
- So, Kyllboi, huh?
- Hmm.

1089
00:54:30.939 --> 00:54:32.315
Why didn't you tell us?

1090
00:54:33.149 --> 00:54:35.109
[stammers] I knew
you'd never get it,

1091
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.570
that you'd just freak out
and ban me for even longer.

1092
00:54:37.571 --> 00:54:39.655
- Here you go.
- I wasn't trying to punish you, you know.

1093
00:54:39.656 --> 00:54:41.282
We just wanted you to
have other interests.

1094
00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:43.534
Make some friends. Be a
little bit more normal.

1095
00:54:43.535 --> 00:54:47.080
I... I have friends.
Okay? Thousands of them.

1096
00:54:47.747 --> 00:54:49.790
People like me when
I'm Kyllboi, okay?

1097
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:51.208
I... I like me.

1098
00:54:51.209 --> 00:54:54.295
But when I'm Kyle, I-I'm
too shy to talk to girls.

1099
00:54:54.296 --> 00:54:57.424
You know, I'm... I'm... I'm not good
enough to make the baseball team.

1100
00:54:57.924 --> 00:54:59.842
I-I'm a nobody. [chuckles]

1101
00:54:59.843 --> 00:55:02.428
But when I'm Kyllboi,
I'm good, Dad.

1102
00:55:02.429 --> 00:55:04.264
Like... Like pro-level good.

1103
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:07.391
[stammers] Look, okay.

1104
00:55:07.392 --> 00:55:09.226
I... I know you think it's
all just a waste of time,

1105
00:55:09.227 --> 00:55:11.605
but it takes brains
and... and reflexes.

1106
00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:13.564
Th... The Air Force
recruits gamers.

1107
00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:15.734
Yeah. Maybe that's
what I'm afraid of.

1108
00:55:21.698 --> 00:55:23.949
- [stammers] Let me show you.
- Show me what?

1109
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:26.827
- [Kyle] What I can do.
- Laser tag?

1110
00:55:26.828 --> 00:55:28.287
- [stammers]
- You can't be serious.

1111
00:55:28.288 --> 00:55:32.333
Single combat, okay? I-I-If I
win, I get to start gaming again.

1112
00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:33.709
If you win, the ban remains.

1113
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:35.461
What, I don't get anything?

1114
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.339
[stammers] Okay, fine.
What do you want?

1115
00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:39.882
A catch. Like we used to.

1116
00:55:39.883 --> 00:55:42.593
You and me in the backyard, throwing
a ball every day for six months.

1117
00:55:42.594 --> 00:55:44.470
[laughs] Dad, I'm... I'm not 12.

1118
00:55:44.471 --> 00:55:46.972
Well, you're gonna smoke me anyway.
Right, Mr. Brains and Reflexes?

1119
00:55:46.973 --> 00:55:48.307
Fine. Good luck.

1120
00:55:48.308 --> 00:55:49.351
You are so screwed.

1121
00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.561
[sighs] Let's go.

1122
00:55:52.562 --> 00:55:54.939
[employee] You're
green. You're blue.

1123
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.649
Once you're hit, you're
out for five seconds.

1124
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.776
First one to three kills, wins.

1125
00:55:58.777 --> 00:56:00.195
You just pull the trigger?

1126
00:56:02.364 --> 00:56:05.032
[automated voice] <i>Death
match. Prepare yourself.</i>

1127
00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:08.702
<i>Three, two, one, fight.</i>

1128
00:56:08.703 --> 00:56:10.163
Go easy on me, buddy.

1129
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.876
Dad. Come on. I'll give
you a free one, yeah?

1130
00:56:15.877 --> 00:56:16.877
All right.

1131
00:56:23.927 --> 00:56:25.886
- [zapping]
- [automated voice] <i>First blood.</i>

1132
00:56:25.887 --> 00:56:27.055
[Dan] Oh, I got lucky there.

1133
00:56:27.764 --> 00:56:28.765
All right. That's one.

1134
00:56:33.436 --> 00:56:34.437
[zapping]

1135
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.023
How are you doing this?

1136
00:56:37.524 --> 00:56:39.526
No, no, no. No, don't... [sighs]

1137
00:56:42.779 --> 00:56:46.408
Hey, Kyllboi. I thought you wanted
to play laser tag, not hide-and-seek.

1138
00:56:52.998 --> 00:56:53.873
[zapping]

1139
00:56:53.874 --> 00:56:58.336
Oh, you sneaky little shit. [chuckles]
You're getting pretty good at this, Kyle.

1140
00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:00.754
[zapping]

1141
00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:03.716
[sighs] Well, at least
I don't need a DNA test.

1144
00:57:20.442 --> 00:57:22.861
[Dan] Kyle, come
on. Don't be mad.

1145
00:57:23.653 --> 00:57:24.862
You conned me.

1146
00:57:24.863 --> 00:57:27.031
You're a... a laser tag savant.

1147
00:57:27.032 --> 00:57:28.449
No. I was a kid in the '80s.

1148
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.285
Yeah, like there were
lasers back then.

1149
00:57:31.244 --> 00:57:33.954
Come on, pal. You
were good in there.

1150
00:57:33.955 --> 00:57:35.789
You adapted quickly.
You got creative.

1151
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.125
You almost had me.

1152
00:57:38.335 --> 00:57:40.879
And I gotta admit, I really
enjoyed doing that with you.

1153
00:57:41.463 --> 00:57:42.881
I mean, it meant a lot to me.

1154
00:57:44.507 --> 00:57:45.634
Are we good?

1155
00:57:46.509 --> 00:57:48.053
Come on. Give me some love.

1156
00:57:48.845 --> 00:57:50.012
Real love. Yeah.

1157
00:57:50.013 --> 00:57:52.139
[laughs]

1158
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:55.393
- Not bad for an old man, huh?
- Uh, yeah. For sure.

1159
00:57:56.561 --> 00:57:59.564
Hey. What do you say, <i>mamacita</i>?

1160
00:58:00.398 --> 00:58:01.815
Home stretch. You ready?

1161
00:58:01.816 --> 00:58:03.067
- [Jess] Vegas!
- [Nina] Are you ready?

1162
00:58:03.068 --> 00:58:04.693
- [babbling]
- [Dan] Maxie.

1163
00:58:04.694 --> 00:58:06.029
["Home" playing]

1164
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.270
- [mouthing words] I love you.
- [mouthing words] I love you.

1165
00:58:26.299 --> 00:58:28.510
[mouthing words] It's amazing.

1177
00:59:20.729 --> 00:59:22.147
How about that?

1178
00:59:29.863 --> 00:59:30.988
Wow!

- [Jess] Dan, the floors are so shiny.

1181
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.872
[chuckles] This is all ours?

- Nina?
- [Nina] Yep.

1189
00:59:56.932 --> 00:59:58.599
You have to look at this tub.

1190
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.268
I gotta run downstairs for a sec.
Don't let them raid the minibar, okay?

Hey.

1196
01:00:16.034 --> 01:00:18.077
Look at you, playing
the family man.

1197
01:00:18.078 --> 01:00:20.788
- I'm not playing. This is my life.
- Hmm.

1198
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:22.469
You see any sign of
trouble on your way in?

1199
01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.625
- Uh-uh.
- Me neither.

1200
01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:27.253
I mean, I messed up, stopping in
Iowa, but I think we're in the clear.

1201
01:00:27.254 --> 01:00:30.089
Well, then enjoy your last
night as Dan Morgan, my friend.

1202
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:34.093
I've got you on a flight to Vancouver in
the morning under your new identities.

1203

Hey. You're a lifesaver,
Augs. Thank you.

1204
01:00:37.305 --> 01:00:39.056
Try to get out of Vegas
with some of it, huh?

1205
01:00:39.057 --> 01:00:41.184
- I promise nothing.
- [laughs]

1206
01:00:42.143 --> 01:00:43.645
How did the family
take the news?

1207
01:00:44.396 --> 01:00:46.982
I haven't told them yet.
I'm telling Jess at dinner.

1208
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:50.442
- I suggest a Japanese restaurant.
- Why?

1209
01:00:50.443 --> 01:00:53.280
No knives. [laughs]

[laughs] I know.

1214
01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:19.972
Wow! What a lucky guy I am.

01:01:21.057 --> 01:01:22.350
Wow!

1217
01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:25.186
Come on.

[Jess sighs]

1219
01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:31.859
Hey. All right.
You two are on Max.

1220
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.111
You're not to leave this
suite under any circumstance.

1221
01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:36.864
There's food in the supersized minibar.
You do not open that door for anyone.

1222
01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:38.157
- You got it?
- [Kyle] Got it.

1223
01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:39.283
- [Dan] What about you, Maxie?
- [babbles]

1224
01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:42.954
- [Jess] You got it? [inhales sharply]
- [Dan] Yeah? All right. Have fun. Be good.

1225
01:01:45.582 --> 01:01:48.043
- [Jess giggles]
- [door opens, closes]

1226
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.629
- Screw that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

1227
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.380
- [inhales deeply] Ready?
- [babbles]

1228
01:01:53.381 --> 01:01:54.549
Let's go.

1229
01:01:56.301 --> 01:01:58.136
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

1230
01:01:59.054 --> 01:02:00.638

1231
01:02:00.639 --> 01:02:02.724

["Chaise Longue" playing]

1233
01:02:15.153 --> 01:02:18.614
[chuckles, gasps] Wow.

1234
01:02:18.615 --> 01:02:21.116
Hey, let's go to HyperX. I
wanna see the esports arena.

1235
01:02:21.117 --> 01:02:25.037
No way. No, no. I'm not spending my time
in an arena full of Kyles. I'm not going.

1236
01:02:25.038 --> 01:02:27.165
Sucks to suck. Me
and Max are going.

1237
01:02:28.124 --> 01:02:30.417
Ugh. [laughs]

1238
01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:32.498
- [Kyle] Hello, Elvis.
- [Elvis impersonator] Uh-huh.

1239
01:02:37.676 --> 01:02:38.760
[laughs]

1240

1242
01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:45.559
- Bye.
- Bye.

1243
01:03:05.579 --> 01:03:07.122
[Nina] Whoo!

1244
01:03:11.418 --> 01:03:13.711
All right. I think it's just
down here. You're gonna love it.

1245
01:03:13.712 --> 01:03:15.129
I already hate it.

1246
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:16.422

1247

[announcer] <i>Welcome to the HyperX Arena.
Five minutes until our final round.</i>

1248
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.055
This is sick.

01:03:25.056 --> 01:03:26.849
Smells like your
room on steroids.

1250
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.934
Thanks.

1251
01:03:28.435 --> 01:03:29.560
That's Ren.

1252
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:31.937
Hi. Sorry. Uh, big
fan. [chuckles]

1253
01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.815
Thanks. Wait. You're, um...

1254
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:37.235
- Kyllboi.
- Yeah. I've seen your streams.

1255

Thanks. [laughs]

1256
01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:41.990
Hey.

1257
01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:44.367
Do you wanna meet
Valkyrae and the others?

1258
01:03:45.035 --> 01:03:46.368
[chuckles] Hell yeah.

1259
01:03:46.369 --> 01:03:48.287
Okay. I have a gift for you.

1260
01:03:48.288 --> 01:03:50.414
- [groans] Okay.
- Take him.

1261

[sighing]

1262
01:03:54.461 --> 01:03:57.129
- Thank you very much. [breathes deeply]
- Mmm.

1263
01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.423
- [breathes deeply] To us.
- Yeah.

1264
01:03:59.424 --> 01:04:02.593
[inhales sharply] I can't
believe we actually did it.

1265
01:04:02.594 --> 01:04:03.928
- We're here.
- Yep.

1266
01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.512
- We're here.
- [sighs]

1267
01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:06.722
- Look, Jess...
- Mmm.

1268
01:04:06.723 --> 01:04:08.682
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Hang on.

1269
01:04:08.683 --> 01:04:10.018
- Come here.
- What?

1270
01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:12.229
- Oh, my God.
- [chuckles] Mmm.

1271
01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:15.482
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1272
01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:19.360
[stammers] Sorry. I interrupted.

1273
01:04:19.361 --> 01:04:22.738
No, no, it's okay. It's just... The
reason that we came on this trip...

1274
01:04:22.739 --> 01:04:24.949
[speaks French]

1275
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:26.201
[gasps]

1276
01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:28.535
[inhales sharply] What
I was saying was...

1277
01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.120
[server, in French] Would
you like some pepper?

1278
01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:32.331
I don't want pepper.

1279
01:04:32.332 --> 01:04:34.250
I want to be alone with my wife.

1280
01:04:34.251 --> 01:04:36.293
[in English] Oh. I don't
actually speak French.

1281
01:04:36.294 --> 01:04:38.087
They just teach us
enough to sound fancy.

1282
01:04:38.088 --> 01:04:39.464
[speaking French]

1283
01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:41.533
[stammers] I'll
give you a minute.

1284
01:04:43.718 --> 01:04:45.053
You speak French too?

1285
01:04:46.763 --> 01:04:48.806
I... I... I took some
French back in the day.

1286
01:04:48.807 --> 01:04:51.308
It's literally kind of weird
that you've never mentioned to me

1287
01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:53.687
that you speak two
foreign languages.

1288
01:04:55.105 --> 01:04:56.897
[sighs]

1289
01:04:56.898 --> 01:04:58.108
How good are you?

1290
01:05:00.318 --> 01:05:02.529
[in French] I don't know,
it has been a while.

1291
01:05:03.071 --> 01:05:04.614
I have traveled
around the world.

1292
01:05:05.824 --> 01:05:09.034
Despite that, it's hard
to tell you the truth.

1293
01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:12.497
I'm afraid to break your heart.

1294
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:16.500
I don't know if you
will still love me...

1295
01:05:16.501 --> 01:05:19.754
once you know who I truly am.

1296
01:05:20.171 --> 01:05:24.049
I'm sorry that you're
being pulled into this...

1297
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.342
but I swear on my life...

1298
01:05:25.343 --> 01:05:27.386
that I'll never
let any person...

1299
01:05:27.387 --> 01:05:32.017
hurt you or the kids.

1300
01:05:34.603 --> 01:05:36.354
[in English] That
was crazy sexy.

1301
01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.565
Why does everything sound
so much better in French?

1302
01:05:39.566 --> 01:05:41.108
Well, it's an innately
melodic language.

1303
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:43.068
At some point, you and
I are gonna have to talk

1304
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.945
about why you never
told me you can do that.

1305
01:05:44.946 --> 01:05:47.656
- I mean, it's crazy you didn't tell me.
- [stammers]

1306
01:05:47.657 --> 01:05:51.076
We should also... [chuckles] ...talk
about how insane you've been acting

1307
01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.995
ever since you showed up
and whisked us off to Vegas.

1308
01:05:52.996 --> 01:05:55.748
But right now... right now, I
just wanna be here with you.

1309
01:05:55.749 --> 01:05:57.958
I wanna be eating
this amazing food,

1310
01:05:57.959 --> 01:06:00.045
and drinking this
champagne we can't afford,

1311
01:06:00.921 --> 01:06:03.548
and enjoying each other's
company, and just maybe...

1312
01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:11.264
showing that ridiculous hotel suite
some moves it has never seen before.

1313
01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:15.936
I don't know about you, but that
sounds like a pretty perfect night.

1314
01:06:18.396 --> 01:06:21.523
- [Valkyrae] What rank are you?
- Um... Uh, Ascendant 3.

1315
01:06:21.524 --> 01:06:24.109
Damn. Really? That's
better than him.

1316
01:06:24.110 --> 01:06:26.111
- [stammers] That's incredible.
- [laughs]

1317
01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.155
- Oh, my.
- How long you been playing for?

1318
01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:30.032
Um, I mean, since
the game came out.

1319
01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:31.784
It's cool your
brother's Kyllboi.

1320
01:06:31.785 --> 01:06:33.244
[scoffs] Is it?

1321
01:06:33.245 --> 01:06:34.663
Yeah. He's the real deal.

1322
01:06:37.415 --> 01:06:39.917
Um, so, is this your...

1323
01:06:39.918 --> 01:06:42.962
[scoffs] No. Oh,
God. No. No, no, no.

1324
01:06:42.963 --> 01:06:45.631
- I found him. Just over there.
- Over there?

1325
01:06:45.632 --> 01:06:48.384
- Yeah. [laughs]
- Just hanging out?

1326
01:06:48.385 --> 01:06:50.761
- It's time for the finals.
- [crowd cheering, clapping]

1327
01:06:50.762 --> 01:06:56.142
Team Valkyrae and Team
iiTzTimmy onto the stage!

1328
01:07:00.146 --> 01:07:02.065
[chuckles] Hey, let's go.

1329
01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:07.320
Use Kyllboi.

1330
01:07:09.489 --> 01:07:10.823
Are you up for it?

1331
01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:12.199
[laughs] The... The finals?

1332
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.520
Yeah, this is one of those
moments, man. Are you in or out?

1333
01:07:16.538 --> 01:07:20.165
- [stammers, laughs] In.
- Let's go. Yeah.

1334
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.375
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Don't be nervous.

1335
01:07:21.376 --> 01:07:23.586
- It'll be a piece of cake. [laughs]
- [Kyle] Thanks.

1336
01:07:23.587 --> 01:07:25.171
Hey, that was kind
of cool of you.

1337
01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:28.424
[grunts] Not really.
They're gonna get destroyed.

1338
01:07:28.425 --> 01:07:29.466
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

1339
01:07:29.467 --> 01:07:31.761
What's up, everyone?

1340
01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:34.598
Take a seat, Kyllboi,
right next to me.

1341
01:07:45.859 --> 01:07:47.110
Whoo!

1344
01:07:56.328 --> 01:07:57.494
Do you have ammo?

1345
01:07:57.495 --> 01:07:59.372
I'm gonna try and block
us off real quick.

1346

Above here.

1347
01:08:06.504 --> 01:08:07.504
Let's go.

1348
01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:10.841
- Good job.
- Okay. Next.

1349
01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:12.385
[roulette dealer] No more bets.

1350
01:08:12.886 --> 01:08:16.931
- Oh, shoot! [groans]
- [stammers] I'm gonna call the kids.

1351
01:08:16.932 --> 01:08:18.097
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Valkyrae] He satcheled in.

1356
01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.651
- Are you serious? What was that?
- Nice!

1357
01:08:29.652 --> 01:08:32.530
- [Kyle] Whoo!
- That was so sick!

Hey, the kids aren't answering. You
wanna... You wanna head back up?

Yeah. Let's...
Let's do it. Okay.

1362
01:08:57.222 --> 01:08:59.307

Look, I'm so sorry we cut
the night short. I didn't...

1367
01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:13.821
Who says we did, huh?

1368
01:09:13.822 --> 01:09:15.155
[breathes deeply]

1369
01:09:15.156 --> 01:09:19.285
Oof. Give me 30 seconds to freshen
up, and then meet me in bed.

1370
01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:20.370
Okay.

1386
01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:55.616
- I've been looking for you.
- Dan.

[breathing heavily]

1388
01:10:59.803 --> 01:11:01.429
Dan. [breathing heavily]

1389
01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:05.224
- Easy, Coogan.

[breathes heavily]

1392
01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.402
Just let her go.

1393
01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:18.904
- She doesn't know anything.
- Well, I'd say she does now, Sean.

[whimpers]

1395
01:11:19.824 --> 01:11:22.784
Yeah. So here's how
this is gonna go.

1396
01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:24.661
First, I'm gonna kill you.

1397
01:11:25.579 --> 01:11:26.699
And then I'm gonna kill her.

1398
01:11:27.872 --> 01:11:30.833
And then I'm gonna have my
associate at HyperX kill your kids.

1399
01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:32.710
[breathing heavily, whimpering]

1400
01:11:32.711 --> 01:11:33.795
[Coogan] How's that sound?

1401
01:11:39.259 --> 01:11:40.467
I can explain.

1402
01:11:40.468 --> 01:11:43.054
[breathing heavily, gasping]

1403
01:11:46.182 --> 01:11:48.183
[retches]

1404
01:11:48.184 --> 01:11:50.477
Oh, that's normal, honey.
Everybody barfs their first time.

1405
01:11:50.478 --> 01:11:52.479
[breathing heavily]

1406
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:53.857
Give me one second.

1407
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.532
[Jess exhales sharply] What?

1408
01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:05.577
[sighs] Oh, my God.
[breathes heavily]

1409
01:12:07.287 --> 01:12:08.580
Jess, wait. Where are you going?

1410
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.248
HyperX.

01:12:14.461 --> 01:12:15.794
[Dan sighs]

1412
01:12:15.795 --> 01:12:18.048
[Jess breathes heavily]

1413
01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:21.967
So, do you... do you want me to
talk, or do you have things to say?

1414
01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:24.094
- Do I have things to say?
- Right. Sorry.

1415
01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:26.556
I have eyeball on me, Sean.

1416
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.349
Fucking eyeball.

[breathes shakily]

1418
01:12:30.268 --> 01:12:32.561
- Jess.
- Shut up. Shut up!

1419
01:12:32.562 --> 01:12:35.064
I don't wanna hear it. I
don't even wanna look at you.

1420
01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:36.398
I just wanna find my kids,

1421
01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:39.652
who don't have their goddamn
phones because you threw them away!

1422
01:12:39.653 --> 01:12:41.488
[crowd cheering]

1423
01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:44.950
Kyllboi, it's just you and me.

1424
01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:49.037
Take this guy. Breach.

1425
01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:53.208
Watch out!

1426
01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:56.670
- I have a rez.
- [Kyle] Okay.

1427
01:13:00.131 --> 01:13:02.342

01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:06.887
It's all on you, man.

1430
01:13:06.888 --> 01:13:08.473
To the left. Nice shot.

1431
01:13:10.642 --> 01:13:12.519
- Nice. One more.
- Coming.

[gasps]

1433
01:13:17.983 --> 01:13:19.484
- Let's go!
- [Kyle] Yes! Yes!

1434
01:13:20.277 --> 01:13:22.195
[announcer 2] We have a winner!

1435
01:13:23.572 --> 01:13:25.865
- Team Valkyrae wins!
- [Kyle] Yes!

1436
01:13:27.826 --> 01:13:29.618
{\an8}[announcer 2] Doesn't get
much closer than that.

1437
01:13:29.619 --> 01:13:32.538
{\an8}Kyllboi! Kyllboi! That's right.

1438
01:13:32.539 --> 01:13:35.792

1442
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:47.345
Oh, shit. Kyle!

1443
01:13:48.972 --> 01:13:50.514
- Hey!
- [Dan] Where's your brother?

1444
01:13:50.515 --> 01:13:52.558
That's a funny story. He's
literally right there.

1445
01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:54.184
- No. Your other brother.
- Okay, yeah. He's fine.

1446
01:13:54.185 --> 01:13:55.269
He's good. He's with Ren.

1447
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.729
- [Jess, Dan] What?
- [Nina] Excuse me.

1448
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.355
- [babbling]
- See? See?

1449
01:13:58.356 --> 01:14:01.735
- He's fine. Max is great. Heya.
- Hey.

1450
01:14:02.819 --> 01:14:03.944
- Okay. [mouthing words] Call me.
- Listen.

01:14:03.945 --> 01:14:06.030
I... I... I know you guys
are mad... [stammers]

1452
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:07.948
Listen, that... that's
me they're cheering for.

1453
01:14:07.949 --> 01:14:10.409
- [Jess] What were you thinking?
- [Nina] Well, Max is fine.

1454
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.369
Okay, look. Guys, we don't
have time for this, okay?

1455
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.704
We need to get out of this city.

1456
01:14:13.705 --> 01:14:14.955
[Nina blows raspberry]
Overreact much?

1457
01:14:14.956 --> 01:14:17.082
Wait, wait. [stammers]
Why do we have to leave?

1458
01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.751
Because. [sighs]

1459
01:14:18.752 --> 01:14:20.837
- Jess, tell them, please.
- This is all on you.

1460
01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:24.840
We have to leave because my former
coworkers are trying to kill us.

1461
01:14:24.841 --> 01:14:26.467
What? From Planet
Car Deals? [chuckles]

1462
01:14:26.468 --> 01:14:28.802
- I'm not kidding around. Ask Max.
- Huh?

1463
01:14:28.803 --> 01:14:30.846
Before I met your mom,
I was a covert assassin.

1464
01:14:30.847 --> 01:14:32.647
I escaped that life, and
now they've found us.

[laughing]

1466
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:38.312
Dad, you are, like, the
biggest wimp on the planet.

1467
01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:39.563
- [gun cocks]

1468
01:14:39.564 --> 01:14:42.316
- Thank you. Move. Go! Now!

1470
01:14:43.236 --> 01:14:46.153
- [Dan] Go, go.
- [Jess groans]

1471
01:14:46.154 --> 01:14:48.907
- Find an exit. Find an exit.
- [Jess breathes heavily]

1472
01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:54.246
- [Dan] Move, guys. Come on.
- [Jess] Go. Go. Go, go, go, go.

1473
01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:01.335
- [Kyle] Dad?
- What the fuck?

1474
01:15:01.336 --> 01:15:03.003
I'm gonna draw her fire, okay?

1475
01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:06.675
When I do, take the kids that way.
I'll be right behind you, okay?

1476
01:15:17.435 --> 01:15:19.270
[Jess gasps, breathes heavily]

1477
01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:21.356
[people screaming]

1478
01:15:24.901 --> 01:15:25.944
[yelps]

1479
01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:40.166
- [panting]
- Go.

1480
01:15:43.461 --> 01:15:45.045
Jess, she's coming. Wait here.

1481
01:15:45.046 --> 01:15:47.007
- [Jess] Okay. Okay.
- [Dan] Wait right here.

1482
01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.636
[grunting]

1483
01:15:52.637 --> 01:15:55.557
- [thumps]
- [people screaming]

1484
01:15:56.141 --> 01:15:57.933
- [retches]
- Oh.

1485
01:15:57.934 --> 01:15:59.768
Uh, it's okay, honey.

1486
01:15:59.769 --> 01:16:01.771
Everyone barfs the first time.

1487
01:16:06.026 --> 01:16:08.111
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on. Let's go.

1488
01:16:11.114 --> 01:16:12.157
Move, guys. Go.

1489
01:16:31.968 --> 01:16:33.553
[Dan] My real name is Sean.

1490
01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:35.931
My mother died when I was four.

1491
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:37.598
My father was prone to violence.

1492
01:16:37.599 --> 01:16:39.851
When I turned 18, it was
straight into the army.

1493
01:16:40.352 --> 01:16:43.062
I dunno. Maybe it was his genes
coming out, but I thrived.

1494
01:16:43.063 --> 01:16:44.813
I was a Green Beret.
I was a Delta.

1495
01:16:44.814 --> 01:16:47.483
And then I was approached
by a man named McCaffrey.

1496
01:16:47.484 --> 01:16:48.944
Former SAS.

1497
01:16:49.527 --> 01:16:52.446
He took my training to a whole other level
and recruited me into a special program.

1498
01:16:52.447 --> 01:16:55.908
- It was a chance to do some real good.
- What kind of special program?

1499
01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:57.701
We took out the
worst of the worst.

1500
01:16:57.702 --> 01:17:00.329
Terrorists, warlords,
kidnappers all over the world.

1501
01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.081
Ones the government
couldn't legally touch.

1502
01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:03.667
Took out, as in...

1503
01:17:05.335 --> 01:17:06.835
- Well, how many?
- Twenty-six.

1504
01:17:06.836 --> 01:17:09.505
- You've killed 26 pe...
- [shushes] No.

1505
01:17:09.506 --> 01:17:11.799
No. No, I w... I went
on 26 operations.

1506
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.051
Oh, God.

1507
01:17:13.718 --> 01:17:15.887
- Thirty-nine people.
- That's more!

1508
01:17:17.556 --> 01:17:19.974
- Are we including this trip?
- Total dead people, Dan!

1509
01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:21.309
- [Nina] Dad.
- Forty-three.

1510
01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:23.227
They were all bad.

1511
01:17:23.228 --> 01:17:26.981
- You are such a hypocrite.
- All bad people.

1512
01:17:26.982 --> 01:17:31.569
You took away the one thing I'm good
at because there's fake violence,

1513
01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.695
and you're a serial killer?

1514
01:17:32.696 --> 01:17:35.364
Dad, you were working
for the good guys, right?

1515
01:17:35.365 --> 01:17:37.116
McCaffrey was a father figure.

1516
01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:38.951
I trusted him, but I was naive.

1517
01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:40.787
I mean, it started out legit.

1518
01:17:41.746 --> 01:17:44.039
But he got greedy and began
farming us out as mercenaries

1519
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.249
- to the highest bidder.
- [sighs]

1520
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.751
And as soon as I found
out, I left. All right?

1521
01:17:47.752 --> 01:17:50.796
I fought my way out, but that
meant turning against my friends,

1522
01:17:50.797 --> 01:17:53.966
my mentor, against the only
real family that I'd ever known.

1523
01:17:53.967 --> 01:17:55.594
So they've been
hunting you ever since.

1524
01:17:56.553 --> 01:17:59.180
- Yeah.
- I am such an idiot.

1525
01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:03.309
This is why you're so secretive,
why you never wanna go anywhere.

1526
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:06.396
[stammers] Why... Why you're
so weird about social media.

1527
01:18:06.897 --> 01:18:08.606
Why you're s... you're
so anti-technology.

1528
01:18:08.607 --> 01:18:11.859
Well, with facial recognition
software, I had no choice.

1529
01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.029
Plus, I really do think that social media
is fundamentally disgusting and gross.

1530
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.781
- [sighs] God.
- But now that they found us, what happens?

1531
01:18:17.782 --> 01:18:18.992
I got it figured out.

1532
01:18:20.035 --> 01:18:21.286
We're good.

1533
01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:24.331
That's yours.

1534
01:18:24.915 --> 01:18:27.250
And that's yours.
And that's yours.

1535
01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:30.294
"Molly Anderson"?

1536
01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:32.004
At least you got a real name.

1537
01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.505
I'm Van.

1538
01:18:33.506 --> 01:18:34.965
[stammers] I'm
a... I'm a vehicle.

1539
01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:36.258
Van?

1540
01:18:36.259 --> 01:18:38.469
Look, we can't go back
to Buffalo, all right?

1541
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.137
Those lives are over. I'm sorry.

1542
01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:44.351
I finally have a life,
and you're ruining it.

1543
01:18:47.646 --> 01:18:49.230
- Thanks, Dad.
- [Dan] Kyle, come back.

1544
01:18:49.231 --> 01:18:52.816
Dad, no. You don't get to
tell us what to do anymore.

1545
01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:55.695
- Ever.
- Come... [sighs]

1546
01:18:57.614 --> 01:18:59.949
- Eighteen years of lies.
- I'm still the man you married.

1547
01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:02.618
- I was just something different before.
- Something different?

1548
01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:04.995
You weren't in a
band or vegan, Dan.

1549
01:19:04.996 --> 01:19:06.956
That would be
something different.

1550
01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:09.375
You were an assassin for hire.

1551
01:19:09.376 --> 01:19:11.085
I kept the truth from
you to protect you, okay?

1552
01:19:11.086 --> 01:19:14.214
- But our love was real.
- Real? Are you serious?

1553
01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:16.799
What, was it so real that
you couldn't trust me

1554
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.802
with knowing how much
danger we were in?

1555
01:19:19.678 --> 01:19:20.804
What did you think?

1556
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:25.224
That I'd go blabbing about it on
the... on the moms' school text chain?

1557
01:19:25.225 --> 01:19:26.976
- No. I...
- Or were you afraid I'd leave you,

1558
01:19:26.977 --> 01:19:28.435
knowing who you really are?

1559
01:19:28.436 --> 01:19:30.479
[chuckles] We were just
some disguise for you,

1560
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.107
just some part of your
cover as a suburban schlub?

1561
01:19:33.108 --> 01:19:36.235
- What? No. No.
- Fuck, you must have resented us. Right?

1562
01:19:36.236 --> 01:19:40.322
Every single day, eking out a living,
wiping kids' asses, driving a minivan.

1563
01:19:40.323 --> 01:19:42.283
I love that minivan.

1564
01:19:42.284 --> 01:19:46.870
I mean, all of a sudden you're, like,
what, James Bond, and now you're what?

1565
01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:48.123
Normal.

1566
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:52.501
A normal guy with a normal,
wonderful, perfect life.

1567
01:19:52.502 --> 01:19:54.211
That's all I've ever wanted.

1568
01:19:54.212 --> 01:19:56.088
I mean, you were a decathlete.

1569
01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:57.464
You should've medaled in Athens.

1570
01:19:57.465 --> 01:19:59.008
Do you resent your
life as a mom?

1571
01:19:59.009 --> 01:20:00.093
Sometimes.

1572
01:20:01.094 --> 01:20:02.803
- Yes.
- [sighs, stammers]

1573
01:20:02.804 --> 01:20:04.014
I don't wanna be that guy.

1574
01:20:05.682 --> 01:20:07.183
I wish I could believe you.

1575
01:20:08.476 --> 01:20:09.603
I really do.

1576
01:20:10.186 --> 01:20:11.687
But to be honest,

1577
01:20:11.688 --> 01:20:14.941
this trip is the happiest
that I have seen you in years.

1578
01:20:15.442 --> 01:20:20.779
[chuckles] A trip in which
you have killed four people.

1579
01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.991
[huffs] I mean, is
this really you?

1580
01:20:26.369 --> 01:20:29.456
You're a stranger named Sean.

1581
01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:35.462
"Archibald Anderson."

1582
01:20:36.046 --> 01:20:37.923
Oh, damn it, Augie.

1583
01:20:39.049 --> 01:20:43.136
You know, first thing in the morning,
I am taking the kids and I am leaving.

1584
01:20:43.762 --> 01:20:46.014
- Jess, it's not safe.
- It's not safe with you.

1585
01:20:46.806 --> 01:20:48.098
They're after you, not us.

1586
01:20:48.099 --> 01:20:51.061
And from now on, I'm making the
decisions about me and the kids.

1587
01:20:52.604 --> 01:20:54.272
[sighs] Jess.

1588
01:21:04.866 --> 01:21:07.076
[Jess] Yeah. Hi. Uh,
thanks for picking up.

1589
01:21:07.077 --> 01:21:08.161
I know it's late.

1590
01:21:08.662 --> 01:21:12.666
I was wondering if you could help with
some travel for my family, please.

1591
01:21:25.595 --> 01:21:28.598
[siren wailing in distance]

1592
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:38.775
[door opens]

1593
01:21:40.443 --> 01:21:42.695
- Where are you going?
- Far from here, far from you.

1594
01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:44.530
- Where?
- It's none of your business.

1595
01:21:44.531 --> 01:21:45.739
What? Like hell it isn't.

1596
01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.033
Hey, you cannot go to the airport, you
know. They're gonna be waiting there.

1597
01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:50.327
Well, we're not. We've
made other arrangements.

1598
01:21:50.328 --> 01:21:51.412
What other arrangements?

1599
01:21:51.413 --> 01:21:54.123
Sorry, Dan. Can't say.
It's to protect you.

1600
01:21:54.124 --> 01:21:56.126
Jess... [stammers] Oh,
really? Come on. Don't...

1601
01:21:58.461 --> 01:22:00.629
Jess. Please. It's not safe.

1602
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.965
Then handle it. Make it safe.

1603
01:22:02.966 --> 01:22:04.968
And when you're done with
it, stay away from us.

1604
01:22:23.028 --> 01:22:24.070
Is this for us?

1605
01:22:24.821 --> 01:22:27.032
No, I don't think
so. Couldn't be.

1606
01:22:34.748 --> 01:22:36.666
- Hi.
- Gwen.

1607
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:40.002
What are you doing here? I
wasn't expecting all this.

1608
01:22:40.003 --> 01:22:43.089
I was on a layover nearby, and I
thought, I'll just come get you myself.

1609
01:22:43.882 --> 01:22:45.090
Okay. Uh...

1610
01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:47.928
[Gwen] Hi. You must
be Molly and Van.

1611
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:52.640
I'm Gwen. Hi, little one. Uh, there's
breakfast on board, if you'd like it.

1612
01:22:52.641 --> 01:22:53.808
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

1613
01:22:55.018 --> 01:22:56.018
[sighs] Thanks.

1614
01:22:56.019 --> 01:22:58.395
Jessica, what is
wrong? Are you okay?

1615
01:22:58.396 --> 01:23:00.690
- Uh...
- What happened? Where's your husband?

1616
01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:02.776
We had a fight.

1617
01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:04.985
[Gwen] Oh, boy.

1618
01:23:04.986 --> 01:23:07.571
Hey, maybe you can help me
with my guy problems then.

1619
01:23:07.572 --> 01:23:09.241
- How about that?
- I'd love to.

1620
01:23:10.283 --> 01:23:12.493
[clicks tongue] Remember that
ex I told you about in Buffalo?

1621
01:23:12.494 --> 01:23:14.495
- Yeah.
- We were together for years.

1622
01:23:14.496 --> 01:23:16.830
It was good. I mean,
it was really good.

1623
01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:21.127
[sucks teeth] You know when you just
can't get enough of each other physically?

1624
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:25.423
I thought he was the one, and
then he just threw it all away.

1625
01:23:26.007 --> 01:23:28.801
Married some other woman who
was the complete opposite of me.

1626
01:23:28.802 --> 01:23:29.886
And the worst part...

1627
01:23:30.762 --> 01:23:31.972
she's insufferable.

1628
01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:34.598
- Wait. You met her?
- Oh, I had to.

1629
01:23:34.599 --> 01:23:36.225
He created this whole
life with this woman,

1630
01:23:36.226 --> 01:23:38.477
and I needed to see what
she had that I didn't.

1631
01:23:38.478 --> 01:23:39.645
[stammers] What did you do?

1632
01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:42.648
I did what I do
best. I got in close,

1633
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:47.654
I won her trust, and then I just waited
patiently for her to walk into my trap.

1634
01:23:53.743 --> 01:23:57.621
You know, I think, um, I
left something in the taxi.

1635
01:23:57.622 --> 01:23:58.914
Hey, Molly?

1636
01:23:58.915 --> 01:24:00.624
- Yeah?
- You wanna bring your brother?

1637
01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:02.627
Let's go. We're leaving.

1638
01:24:07.799 --> 01:24:08.799
[babbles]

1639
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:10.926
I told you to stay off this op.

1640
01:24:10.927 --> 01:24:14.847
And yet, who brought them
to you in a big, fat bow?

1641
01:24:14.848 --> 01:24:16.307
You needed me.

1642
01:24:16.308 --> 01:24:18.143
I know Sean better
than you ever will.

1643
01:24:21.062 --> 01:24:23.062
Do whatever you want with
the family. I don't care.

1644
01:24:23.732 --> 01:24:26.817
I just want Sean. He's
my payment for delivery.

1645
01:24:26.818 --> 01:24:29.236
[babbles]

1646
01:24:29.237 --> 01:24:30.447
[phone buzzes]

1647
01:24:37.787 --> 01:24:39.705
You couldn't let it
go, could you? [sighs]

1648
01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:41.750
<i>You know me better than that.</i>

1649
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:43.918
Look, you can have me,

1650
01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:46.128
but I want your word that
you won't go after my family.

1651
01:24:46.129 --> 01:24:47.255
"Go after"?

1652
01:24:47.881 --> 01:24:50.175
You're a little
behind, buddy boy.

1653
01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:54.678
- I swear to God, if you hurt them...
- Come and get 'em.

1654
01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:56.096
Somewhere public.

1655
01:24:56.097 --> 01:24:58.807
I think you're mistaking
who holds the cards here.

1656
01:24:58.808 --> 01:25:02.562
<i>Be at the old Poseidon Casino
north of the city in 30 minutes...</i>

1657
01:25:03.563 --> 01:25:04.564
<i>alone.</i>

1658
01:25:05.857 --> 01:25:07.567
[sighs deeply]

1659
01:25:09.027 --> 01:25:11.029
[breathes heavily]

1660
01:25:46.231 --> 01:25:47.524
Come on out!

1661
01:25:52.904 --> 01:25:54.446
Hello, old friend.

1662
01:25:54.447 --> 01:25:56.448
He brought you in for
this, huh, Spiros?

1663
01:25:56.449 --> 01:25:58.159
He brought everybody.

1664
01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:01.746
- Follow me.
- [drone whirring]

1665
01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:09.796
He's alone.

1666
01:26:10.672 --> 01:26:13.174
Well, well. How sweet.

1667
01:26:13.925 --> 01:26:15.759
He could have been halfway
around the world by now,

1668
01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.265
and yet here he is, trading his life
for the family that abandoned him.

1669
01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:25.644
So, am I ever getting back that
five grand I lent you in Morocco?

1670
01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:26.729
I'll tell you what.

1671
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:30.150
If you're still alive in ten minutes,
I'll pay you back with interest.

1672
01:26:31.192 --> 01:26:34.487
Oh, shame. It's a
beautiful place.

1673
01:26:35.196 --> 01:26:37.157
They're demolishing
it in ten days.

1674
01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:40.535
[elevator dings]

1675
01:26:47.334 --> 01:26:49.502
[Dan] All this for me,
huh? I'm flattered.

1676
01:26:50.545 --> 01:26:51.545
How's the family?

1677
01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:53.089
Which one?

1678
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:55.717
We're coming up.

1679
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.234
There he is.

1680
01:27:13.235 --> 01:27:14.236
Are you okay?

1681
01:27:24.496 --> 01:27:25.996
No hug for your old man?

1682
01:27:25.997 --> 01:27:27.832
Why start now, Dad?

1683
01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:29.875
[stammers] I'm sorry, what?

1684
01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:31.920
I'm your grandfather, Kyle.

1685
01:27:34.005 --> 01:27:35.966
O-Oh my... Oh, my God.
We're... We're British.

1686
01:27:37.259 --> 01:27:38.634
He didn't tell ya?

1687
01:27:38.635 --> 01:27:41.805
No. He left that part out
of his no-more-lies speech.

1688
01:27:42.389 --> 01:27:45.140
- Well, I said he was a father figure.
- Not quite the same, Dan.

1689
01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:48.144
This is good, right? He's not
gonna kill his own grandkids.

1690
01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.855
Look, do whatever you
want with me. Let them go.

1691
01:27:51.856 --> 01:27:54.150
What is it you
think I want, Sean?

1692
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:55.652
Kill me.

1693
01:27:56.152 --> 01:27:59.071
In that spider's nest of a heart, you
actually think that I wronged you.

1694
01:27:59.072 --> 01:28:00.490
You were my son.

1695
01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:03.285
My legacy.

1696
01:28:04.703 --> 01:28:07.664
I poured everything I am into
you. You threw it all away.

1697
01:28:08.206 --> 01:28:10.374
You abandoned me.
You broke my heart.

1698
01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:12.210
So, yeah. I wanted you dead.

1699
01:28:13.003 --> 01:28:16.005
But then something happened
over these past few days.

1700
01:28:16.006 --> 01:28:19.092
You wasted every single guy I
sent at you. Every goddamn one.

1701
01:28:20.427 --> 01:28:23.762
You are every bit the
killer I taught you to be.

1702
01:28:23.763 --> 01:28:26.307
No. It's not who I am anymore.

1703
01:28:26.308 --> 01:28:27.392
Bullshit.

1704
01:28:29.019 --> 01:28:31.061
Tell me you didn't feel more
alive the past three days

1705
01:28:31.062 --> 01:28:34.398
- than you have done in years.
- [sighs]

1706
01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:36.943
[McCaffrey] And as you
smoked each of my men,

1707
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:41.907
I felt something that I haven't
felt in a very long time.

1708
01:28:43.283 --> 01:28:45.492
Pride in my son.

1709
01:28:45.493 --> 01:28:46.745
What? So, what is this?

1710
01:28:47.454 --> 01:28:49.622
Now you don't wanna kill me?
What the hell do you want?

1711
01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:50.956
I want you back.

1712
01:28:50.957 --> 01:28:52.124
What?

1713
01:28:52.125 --> 01:28:54.211
Things were never as
good after you left.

1714
01:28:56.504 --> 01:28:57.964
For any of us.

1715
01:28:59.007 --> 01:29:04.345
So, I want my son back, working
by my side in the family business.

1716
01:29:04.346 --> 01:29:06.889
You're... You're not
seriously considering this,

1717
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:08.891
- are you, Dad?
- Quiet, Kyle.

1718
01:29:08.892 --> 01:29:11.686
Everybody wins. You come
back where you belong.

1719
01:29:12.187 --> 01:29:13.688
Be who you were born to be.

1720
01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:16.565
Jess and the kids go
safely back to Buffalo.

1721
01:29:16.566 --> 01:29:18.276
It's what they want anyway.

1722
01:29:20.195 --> 01:29:22.197
Sure beats the shit
out of selling cars.

1723
01:29:23.365 --> 01:29:26.492
But no contact. Can't have
you going soft on me again.

1724
01:29:26.493 --> 01:29:28.613
I'm their father. There's
no way this is gonna happen.

1725
01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.123
I'm sorry to hear that.

1726
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:37.086
- Start with the wife.
- [gun cocks]

1727
01:29:37.087 --> 01:29:39.755
- Wait, no! I...
- [McCaffrey] There's no third option!

1728
01:29:39.756 --> 01:29:42.091
Either it all ends here and now,

1729
01:29:42.092 --> 01:29:46.680
or you give your family exactly
what they want and then some!

1730
01:29:53.562 --> 01:29:54.562
I'll do it.

1731
01:29:55.522 --> 01:29:56.898
[babbling]

1732
01:29:58.024 --> 01:29:59.025
Okay.

1733
01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:04.656
Spiros, see the family to the
airport with our blessing.

1734
01:30:05.156 --> 01:30:06.783
[Jess sighs]

1735
01:30:07.742 --> 01:30:08.994
[breathes heavily]

1736
01:30:14.833 --> 01:30:16.542
[sobbing]

1737
01:30:16.543 --> 01:30:18.587
[breathes heavily]

1738
01:30:25.135 --> 01:30:29.054
- Dad. [babbles]
- [whimpering]

1739
01:30:29.055 --> 01:30:30.347
Dad, please. [sobs]

1740
01:30:30.348 --> 01:30:32.350
I love you. I'll
always love you.

1741
01:30:36.646 --> 01:30:38.647
Look, we can't just abandon Dad.

1742
01:30:38.648 --> 01:30:40.399
What am I supposed to do?

1743
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.943
It's my job to keep you safe.

1744
01:30:42.944 --> 01:30:44.028
I'm a mom.

1745
01:30:44.029 --> 01:30:46.113
Okay, then... then be the
mom that lifts the car.

1746
01:30:46.114 --> 01:30:47.656
- What?
- You know, the... the mom.

1747
01:30:47.657 --> 01:30:49.408
She... She has the baby,
and she lifts the car.

1748
01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:50.744
Yeah. You know. Car mom.

1749
01:30:51.244 --> 01:30:54.288
I have no idea what you're
talking about. [sighs]

1750
01:30:54.289 --> 01:30:56.333
It's an urban
legend, Mrs. Morgan.

1751
01:30:57.626 --> 01:31:00.252
- A baby is trapped under a car.
- [elevator dings]

1752
01:31:00.253 --> 01:31:05.425
His mother gets a burst of adrenaline
and lifts the car up with her bare hands.

1753
01:31:07.469 --> 01:31:10.471
Your children are suggesting you
overpower me to rescue their father.

1754
01:31:10.472 --> 01:31:12.139
Yeah. Thank you. Exactly.

1755
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.432
I would advise against it.

1756
01:31:13.433 --> 01:31:15.392
[stammers] Now. Duh.

1757
01:31:15.393 --> 01:31:16.977
Your father made his choice.

1758
01:31:16.978 --> 01:31:19.397
[sighs] I mean, do you
think he wants this?

1759
01:31:20.148 --> 01:31:21.815
It's Dad that we're
talking about.

1760
01:31:21.816 --> 01:31:25.402
The guy that... that took me to junior
prom when Trevor didn't show up.

1761
01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:29.407
The guy that... that wakes us up for
school with shitty raps about Wednesdays.

1762
01:31:29.908 --> 01:31:32.243
That's beautiful. My
father never did that.

1763
01:31:32.244 --> 01:31:34.162
I'm sorry. Can you
shut up, Spiros?

1764
01:31:35.455 --> 01:31:37.123
- [elevator dings]
- [sighs]

1765
01:31:39.209 --> 01:31:40.669
[Spiros] Hey, hey,
hey, hey. Stop.

1766
01:31:43.046 --> 01:31:47.091
[clears throat, sighs] Children.

1767
01:31:47.092 --> 01:31:48.801
Mom, we're not a
family without Dad.

1768
01:31:48.802 --> 01:31:50.719
Dad needs to know that
we don't want this.

1769
01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:54.014
I... I... I know we said we did
last night, but, Mom, I... I don't.

1770
01:31:54.015 --> 01:31:55.141
[elevator dings]

1771
01:31:56.726 --> 01:32:00.396
If... If he still chooses to
do it, then... then so be it.

1772
01:32:00.397 --> 01:32:01.730
But he needs to know.

1773
01:32:01.731 --> 01:32:03.023
[sighs]

1774
01:32:03.024 --> 01:32:05.902
I mean, he thinks that we
don't love him anymore, Mom.

1775
01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:08.154
We can't just let
things end like that.

1776
01:32:11.241 --> 01:32:13.868
[sniffing] Oh, Max.

1777
01:32:14.869 --> 01:32:16.620
I haven't changed you.

1778
01:32:16.621 --> 01:32:19.748
We have to get this off of
you before you get a rash.

1779
01:32:19.749 --> 01:32:21.041
You forgot the diaper bag.

1780
01:32:21.042 --> 01:32:22.126
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

1781
01:32:22.127 --> 01:32:23.168
[grunts]

1782
01:32:23.169 --> 01:32:24.712
- Oh, my gosh.
- [elevator dings]

1783
01:32:24.713 --> 01:32:27.215
- Ooh, gosh. It's a real messy one.
- [groans]

1784
01:32:28.508 --> 01:32:30.010
[Spiros groaning]

1785
01:32:32.846 --> 01:32:34.848
[Spiros screaming]

1786
01:32:36.182 --> 01:32:39.435
- [grunts, gasps] Oh, crap.
- [thuds]

1787
01:32:39.436 --> 01:32:41.021
[panting]

1788
01:32:41.897 --> 01:32:43.273
Uh, maybe he'll be all right.

1789
01:32:44.107 --> 01:32:45.108
Or not.

1790
01:32:45.609 --> 01:32:46.818
What do we do now?

1791
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.825
We're gonna go find your dad.

1792
01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.454
Give me a minute alone
with him, would you?

1793
01:32:58.455 --> 01:33:00.582
I wanna be wheels
up in ten minutes.

1794
01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.254
I thought if I ever saw
you again, I'd kill you.

1795
01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.841
But since we're here...

1796
01:33:13.303 --> 01:33:15.012
[moans] Better.

1797
01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:17.307
Oh, sure. Pretend I'm not here.

1798
01:33:23.188 --> 01:33:25.522
This isn't gonna
happen. I have a wife.

1799
01:33:25.523 --> 01:33:27.567
You had a wife.

1800
01:33:28.318 --> 01:33:29.819
Now you're free.

1801
01:33:33.365 --> 01:33:36.951
[moans] Doesn't it feel good
to be back where you belong?

1802
01:33:36.952 --> 01:33:38.161
It's been a long time, Gwen.

1803
01:33:39.037 --> 01:33:40.705
[kisses]

1804
01:33:46.002 --> 01:33:47.754
You think I forgot
your little tricks?

1805
01:33:48.672 --> 01:33:50.172
You think I forgot this?

1806
01:33:50.173 --> 01:33:52.258
- [moans]
- [gasps]

1807
01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:53.592
[sighs]

1808
01:33:53.593 --> 01:33:55.052
I knew you hadn't changed.

1809
01:33:55.053 --> 01:33:56.303
[sighs]

1810
01:33:56.304 --> 01:33:57.888
You could never resist me.

1811
01:33:57.889 --> 01:33:59.223
Hmm.

1812
01:33:59.224 --> 01:34:01.141
[breathes heavily]

1813
01:34:01.142 --> 01:34:02.476
- [grunts]
- [groans]

1814
01:34:02.477 --> 01:34:03.978
Vulcan neck pinch.

1815
01:34:03.979 --> 01:34:05.062
- Kyusho Jitsu.
- [gasping]

1816
01:34:05.063 --> 01:34:08.524
Whoa. Whoa! Hey. [chuckles] I'm
just the tech guy. [chuckles]

1817
01:34:08.525 --> 01:34:09.858
I'm so sorry for this, you guys.

1818
01:34:09.859 --> 01:34:12.194
For the ass-grabbing part or
the 18-years-of-deception thing?

1819
01:34:12.195 --> 01:34:14.322
Both. All of it.

1820
01:34:15.407 --> 01:34:16.741
Hey. Tie him up.

1821
01:34:17.659 --> 01:34:19.827
- Yeah. You.
- Come on.

1822
01:34:19.828 --> 01:34:22.329
I wanted to tell you about everything,
but there was never a good time.

1823
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:24.832
- Never a good time?
- When was I gonna tell you?

1824
01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.458
On our first date? Our second?

1825
01:34:26.459 --> 01:34:28.085
When you were pregnant
with Nina or by our fourth?

1826
01:34:28.086 --> 01:34:30.212
- What?
- Do the math, Nina.

1827
01:34:30.213 --> 01:34:31.922
Any of those times would
have been a better time.

1828
01:34:31.923 --> 01:34:34.508
You should have told me the truth,
and I could have made up my own mind.

1829
01:34:34.509 --> 01:34:37.512
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was stupid and selfish.

1830
01:34:38.013 --> 01:34:39.430
But I was in love with you.

1831
01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:41.850
I mean, you've been my whole
world since the moment we met.

1832
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:44.518
Being your husband and their
father, that's the real me.

1833
01:34:44.519 --> 01:34:46.104
That's all that matters to me.

1834
01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:49.863
All right. I swear on my life, I'll
never keep anything from you again.

1835
01:34:50.358 --> 01:34:51.651
[sighs]

1836
01:34:52.903 --> 01:34:54.905
[phone line rings]

1837
01:34:55.488 --> 01:34:56.780
[beeps]

1838
01:34:56.781 --> 01:34:57.866
Where's Spiros?

1839
01:34:58.533 --> 01:34:59.868
Thought they were with you.

1840
01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:08.375
Hey, bro.

1841
01:35:08.376 --> 01:35:11.879
Everyone I know is talking about what
Kyllboi did at HyperX last night.

1842
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.047
- Really?
- Yeah. [chuckles]

1843
01:35:13.048 --> 01:35:15.217
Kyle. Less talking,
more tying, okay?

1844
01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:17.761
- Ow.
- Sorry.

1845
01:35:18.345 --> 01:35:21.013
[chuckles] No way.
A Sky Raven drone?

1846
01:35:21.014 --> 01:35:22.181
Awesome.

1847
01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:23.600
[tracker] Just, careful with it.

1848
01:35:25.977 --> 01:35:28.854
- Hey, man. You got a great kid. Ow! Ow!
- I need your comms.

1849
01:35:28.855 --> 01:35:29.940
Dude!

1850
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.480
[Dan] Hey, Kyle. Give me that.

1851
01:35:42.661 --> 01:35:45.163
You're not
anti-technology. You're...

1852
01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:49.751
You're awesome.

1853
01:35:55.090 --> 01:35:56.966
- They're coming.
- What?

1854
01:35:56.967 --> 01:35:59.343
Go up to the roof and find somewhere
to hide with the kids, okay?

1855
01:35:59.344 --> 01:36:01.512
- No, you're not going down there.
- [kisses]

1856
01:36:01.513 --> 01:36:03.597
It's the only way to end this.
This is the only way we go home.

1857
01:36:03.598 --> 01:36:05.933
We don't have to go home. We can just
go to Canada and be the Andersons.

1858
01:36:05.934 --> 01:36:07.518
- Please, Dad.
- It's too late for that, Beans.

1859
01:36:07.519 --> 01:36:09.603
No. You're not giving
yourself up to them.

1860
01:36:09.604 --> 01:36:11.815
No. I'm getting us home.

1861
01:36:12.524 --> 01:36:13.691
- [babbling]
- Okay.

1862
01:36:13.692 --> 01:36:14.693
[sighs]

1863
01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:18.280
[Dan] I got a plan.

1864
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:23.242
Look, I need to be that
guy one last time for us.

1865
01:36:23.243 --> 01:36:26.245
- [sighs]
- Dad. Th... There's too many of 'em.

1866
01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:27.872
Well, I have something
they don't have.

1867
01:36:29.165 --> 01:36:30.417
Kyllboi.

1868
01:36:31.877 --> 01:36:34.295
That's your comms. You're my eyes and
my ears, okay? I'm counting on you.

1869
01:36:34.296 --> 01:36:36.046
[sighs] Let's go.

1870
01:36:36.047 --> 01:36:37.257
Move out, Kyllboi.

1871
01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:40.093
<i>Hey, Kyle, you're on
the same channel as me.</i>

1872
01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:46.182
I want every inch of
this atrium covered.

1873
01:37:03.408 --> 01:37:04.534
[Jess breathes heavily]

1874
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.294
[sniper] Movement
on the elevator!

1875
01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:17.004
The elevator door. Now!

1876
01:37:17.005 --> 01:37:20.217
You see a shot, you take it,
because, believe me, he will.

1877
01:37:22.302 --> 01:37:23.302
You got a shot?

1878
01:37:23.303 --> 01:37:24.863
[sniper] Negative.
I don't see him yet.

1879
01:37:46.326 --> 01:37:47.327

["Wheels On The Bus" playing]

1881
01:37:51.623 --> 01:37:53.123
[assassin] He's not here.

1882
01:37:53.124 --> 01:37:54.209
Wait.

1883
01:37:57.295 --> 01:37:58.295
What do ya got?

1884
01:37:59.756 --> 01:38:02.717
- Take cover! [screams]
- [grunting]

1885
01:38:04.177 --> 01:38:05.554
[Kyle] Holy shit.

1886

Hey. See anybody? [grunts]

- Shit.

1891
01:38:17.274 --> 01:38:18.649
Talk to me, Kyle.

1892
01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:20.067
You're my eyes.

1893
01:38:20.068 --> 01:38:21.777
You're clear on
your right. Go now.

[Dan] <i>Talk to me, Kyle.</i>

1905
01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.892
They've got the drone.

1912
01:39:06.239 --> 01:39:07.323

1919
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:23.130
Kid's got the drone.

1920
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:24.299
Find him.

1921

Call it off, Dad!

1923

Change your mind, Sean?

1924

No. But here's your chance to.

1925
01:39:34.643 --> 01:39:35.893
Call it off now.

1926
01:39:35.894 --> 01:39:39.688
You don't have it in you to
kill your own flesh and blood.

1927
01:39:39.689 --> 01:39:42.483
I, on the other hand,
do have it in me.

1928
01:39:42.484 --> 01:39:43.860
Let him have it!

[Nina] Wai... Wait. No.

1934

Look after your brothers.
Don't make a sound.

1946
01:40:40.625 --> 01:40:43.127
I know the sound of an empty
gun when I hear one, sweetie.

1947
01:40:43.128 --> 01:40:46.548
So why don't we make
this real easy, shall we?

1948

[breathes shakily]

1949
01:40:49.259 --> 01:40:50.886
Unless you think
you can take me.

[laughs] You think
you can beat me

1956
01:41:05.567 --> 01:41:09.278
because you took some kickboxing
classes at the Y and wear Lululemon?

1957
01:41:09.279 --> 01:41:11.698
- Ooh, no.
- [grunting, panting]

[panting] Yeah.

1962

You know I do this
for a living, right?

1963
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:27.296
While you were popping out
brats and clipping coupons,

1964
01:41:27.297 --> 01:41:29.465
I was assassinating dictators.

1965
01:41:29.466 --> 01:41:32.468
So, why don't you
go back to the PTA?

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.520
Okay, I'm going.
I'm chasing him.

I was wrong about you, Sean.

2003
01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.760
You're no use to me.

2004
01:44:19.844 --> 01:44:21.555
Family have made you weak.

2005
01:44:22.597 --> 01:44:25.975

Hi. Going somewhere?

You know, that move you

That was a very bad idea.

2013

Look. For what it's worth, killing minors
is the least favorite part of my job.

2014

Far as I'm concerned,
this is an act of mercy.

2054
01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:15.019
I'm saving you 20 more
years of selling used cars.

2060
01:47:24.362 --> 01:47:26.864
I know you think that
we probably hate you

2061
01:47:26.865 --> 01:47:29.867
for everything that's happened
these past few days, and...

2062
01:47:29.868 --> 01:47:31.077
and maybe we should.

2063
01:47:32.287 --> 01:47:36.958
But I've learned that family is the most
important thing in the entire world.

2064
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.756
And when I... when I look at you, I
don't just see a cold-blooded killer.

2065
01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.883
I see my grandpa.

[babbles]

2067
01:47:52.182 --> 01:47:54.726
And maybe... maybe there's a
way for us to move forward...

2068
01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.313
as a family.

2069
01:47:59.981 --> 01:48:03.734
Kid, if you think this little
speech is gonna win me over...

2070
01:48:03.735 --> 01:48:06.321
[sighs] Honestly...

2071
01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.243

him enough time to do this.

That's bullshit. You said
there'd be two hostiles.

I lied. But, Sam, that was
better. Take him down harder.
