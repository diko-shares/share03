00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.763
<i>There comes a time in every man's
life when he asks himself...</i>

2
00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.851
<i>"Am I living the
life I should be?"</i>

3
00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.563
<i>"Or am I capable of
something greater?"</i>

4
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:06.192
<i>"Is there a change that I
can make in my life right now</i>

5
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.237
<i>to become the best
version of myself?</i>

6
00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:12.114
<i>Who do I wanna be?"</i>

7
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.490
What is the life
that I wanna have?

8
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.869
What is the face that I
wanna present to the world?

9
00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:20.665
These are the kinds of questions
that keep you up at night.

10
00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:25.002
And when you're behind the wheel of a
high-performance automobile like this,

11
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:26.879
no one asks those questions.

12
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.423
They know you are that guy.

13
00:01:29.424 --> 00:01:31.343
You have that life.

14
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.266
Maybe I should look for
something less cool.

15
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:42.437
Can I be honest?

16
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.315
That's your ex talking.

17
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.026
We gotta get your
confidence back.

18
00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:50.152
If there's one
thing I've learned,

19
00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:53.240
it is never too late to become the
man that you've always wanted to be.

20
00:01:56.493 --> 00:01:58.077
Dan! I don't know how you do it.

21
00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:00.329
Guy looks like he just
got himself a Lambo.

22
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.289
Hey, one man's lemon is
another man's lemonade.

23
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.290
He just needed a squeeze.

24
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:05.669
Well, it's earned you
Salesman of the Month again.

25
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:10.464
Nice!

26
00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:13.300
Hey, Deb. Can you take a photo
of Dan for the website, please?

27
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:15.844
You know what? I actually...
I'm sorry, I gotta get home.

28
00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:18.514
- It's my anniversary.
- Oh, come on, Dan. You do this every time.

29
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.307
Give it to Hal.

30
00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:21.433
What's up, losers?

31
00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.186
Hal, how many times have I told you
about driving on the lot like that?

32
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.940
Cars are like chicks,
Jorge. They wanna go fast.

33
00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:30.026
Your fly's open.

34
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:33.612
Dan... Come on. Don't make
me give it to this guy.

35
00:02:33.613 --> 00:02:35.907
Oh, come on. I mean, he's
just got his teeth done.

36
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:37.826
Go get 'em, Hal.

- Hey, Beau.
- Hey!

43
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.134
I told you already, Nina. Stanford
is restrictive early action.

44
00:03:37.135 --> 00:03:39.261
If you apply to Iowa now,
you could mess it all up.

45
00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:40.721
I know what I'm doing.

Do you? It certainly doesn't
look like it from here.

- Hey. You thought I forgot.

49

Can you please tell Nina that we're not
paying for her to follow Trevor to Iowa?

You got any plans this weekend?

57
00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.377
Come on. We'll go in the
yard, throw a few pitches,

58
00:04:11.378 --> 00:04:13.045
see if you got any gas
left in this cannon.

59

You made me quit gaming
so I'd make friends.

63
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.304
I made you quit gaming because
blowing people's heads off 24-7

64
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:23.389
isn't exactly healthy.

65
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.891
You know, you're meant to be babysitting
tonight. It's our anniversary.

66
00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:27.477
What? Why can't she?

67
00:04:29.104 --> 00:04:31.063
- What, because I'm a woman?
- That is not what I'm saying.

68
00:04:31.064 --> 00:04:32.690
- That's what you're saying to me.
- It's not.

69
00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.400
- What is wrong with you?
- Are you kidding?

70
00:04:34.401 --> 00:04:35.651
- Is this Trevor? Who's talking now?
- Really?

71
00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:37.403
Do you have a life other than
just freaking pissing me off?

72
00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:38.529
- Is it Nina or Trevor?
- I'm serious...

73
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.241
All right. Come on.
Stop it, okay? Please.

74
00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.742
Look, Nina. Can you cover
for your brother tonight?

75
00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:45.536
It might be good for him to
finally get out of the house,

76
00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.330
and you can work on
your application.

77
00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:50.917
Fine.

78
00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.420
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

79
00:04:56.172 --> 00:04:57.214
Look, can you just...

80
00:04:57.215 --> 00:04:59.675
Can you talk to Mom and ask
her to, like, lay off of me?

81
00:04:59.676 --> 00:05:00.801
Because I'm a grown woman.

82
00:05:00.802 --> 00:05:01.886
I heard that, Nina.

83
00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:03.846
I'll talk to her. But
seriously, Beans...

84
00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:04.930
- No, don't call me that.
- No.

85
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:06.223
What happened to
journalism at Stanford?

86
00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:08.225
- Wasn't that the dream?
- Journalism is dead, Dad.

87
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:09.310
Yeah, right.

88
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.395
- Is that something that Trevor said, or...
- Yeah, really.

89
00:05:11.396 --> 00:05:12.813
- He shouldn't say that.
- Really? Yes.

90
00:05:12.814 --> 00:05:14.189
He shouldn't be putting
ideas in your head.

91
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.566
- I'm brainwashed.
- My God. Honey,

92
00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.651
I am so glad it's not just me.

93
00:05:17.652 --> 00:05:18.819
Oh, my gosh.

94
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.279
- All right, Maxie.
- Okay.

95
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.989
I'm gonna put him to bed.

96
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.115
And then?

97
00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:25.159
- Are we still doing this?
- Oh, we're doing it.

98
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.244
Awesome.

99
00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:53.355
Hey, Samir.

100
00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:02.613

102
00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.244
All right. Here we go.

103
00:06:09.496 --> 00:06:11.496
Come on. Let me show you
how it's done. Watch this.

104
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.752
Give me the last one,
guys. Come on. Come on.

105
00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:18.713
Boom!

106
00:06:19.422 --> 00:06:20.422
Yes!

107
00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:24.469
- Oh, man. Kyllboi's awesome.
- Kyllboi's sick.

108
00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:27.805
We're actually gonna go as a
group, so you can go ahead.

109
00:06:27.806 --> 00:06:28.889
Oh, yeah.

110
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.642
- Eighteen years. Can you believe it?
- It's nuts we keep coming back here

111
00:06:31.643 --> 00:06:33.395
every year for Twisted Cyclone.

112
00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:35.980
What? No. I meant
18 years married.

113
00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:37.690
And I thought you
loved this tradition.

114
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:39.275
- I do!
- Are you sure?

115
00:06:39.276 --> 00:06:40.609
I did.

116
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.570
I just... I don't know, you're
such a creature of habit.

117
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:43.821
I love that about you.

118
00:06:43.822 --> 00:06:45.906
You know, we make
tacos on Wednesdays...

119
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:49.034
- Well, Tuesday, everybody's doing it.
- And we have sex on Thursdays.

120
00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:50.369
If we can get the
kids out of the house.

121
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.745
- I know.
- We gotta get them out more...

122
00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:53.247
- I know. No one makes a better...
- If we want more time.

123
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:55.874
weekly planner than you
do, but I don't know.

124
00:06:55.875 --> 00:06:59.003
Maybe I just wanna be a little
bit more spontaneous and travel,

125
00:06:59.004 --> 00:07:01.380
or... I kind of feel like
we don't really go anywhere.

126
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:03.674
Well, I mean... Well, we got
the kids, and they got school,

127
00:07:03.675 --> 00:07:05.092
they got routines and friends...

128
00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:06.635
- What friends?
- And just all that type of stuff.

129
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:09.430
Kyle has one friend which, by the
way, he never even invites over.

130
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:10.890
Yeah, but he's a
human with a pulse.

131
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:12.099
- I'll take it.
- God.

132
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.601
- Nina's the one I'm worried about.
- I know.

133
00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.102
She's so anti-establishment.

134
00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:17.272
- She's anti the system. She's anti...
- Anti me.

135
00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:20.108
Oh, come on. You know it's true.

136
00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:24.987
- I'm sorry.
- No.

137
00:07:24.988 --> 00:07:26.071
Now's not the time.

138
00:07:26.072 --> 00:07:27.156
You're right.

139
00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:30.200
Now is the time to nut up and get ready
for the near-death adrenaline rush

140
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:33.537
of Buffalo's 1998 winner of the
fourth-finest roller coaster.

141
00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:35.456
- I know. It's good.
- Do you think you can handle it?

142
00:07:35.457 --> 00:07:37.584
Do you think I can
still handle it?

143
00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:40.544
Baby!

144
00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:42.713
- You're so crazy!
- You know I love you!

145
00:07:42.714 --> 00:07:45.175
- I love you!
- Yeah!

146
00:07:53.558 --> 00:07:55.893
I promise, next year,
we'll go somewhere else.

147
00:07:55.894 --> 00:07:59.313
- No. We'll always have Twisted Cyclone.
- No, look. I don't need to come back here

148
00:07:59.314 --> 00:08:01.857
to remember that this is
where I fell in love with you

149
00:08:01.858 --> 00:08:03.317
on our very first date,

150
00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:05.277
holding your hair
back while you barfed.

151
00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:07.905
I still can't believe
you wanted to kiss me.

152
00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.324
I'll always wanna kiss you.

153
00:08:10.408 --> 00:08:11.409
Yeah.

154
00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:19.083
Hey.

155
00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:21.293
That picture you just took, it
was kind of a private moment.

156
00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:23.504
- You mind deleting it?
- Yeah, I do.

157
00:08:23.505 --> 00:08:24.923
Hey, come on, man. Don't.

158
00:08:27.634 --> 00:08:28.843
Don't do that.

159
00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:32.304
Hey, come on. Take it down.

160
00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:35.558
Take it down.

161
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.684
Make me.

162
00:08:36.685 --> 00:08:38.394
Hey, Dan. Leave it. Let's...

163
00:08:38.395 --> 00:08:40.397
Yeah. Listen to your lady, Dan.

164
00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.277
Is there a tough
guy in there, Dan?

165
00:08:45.986 --> 00:08:47.112
Are you a tough guy?

166
00:09:02.377 --> 00:09:03.378
Hey, tell me.

167
00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:06.339
How'd a loser like him get
a girl as fine as you...

168
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:07.966
probably were?

169
00:09:13.305 --> 00:09:14.848
- Bye, Dan.
- Bye, Dan.

170
00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:23.356
I didn't want you to fight him.

171
00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:27.484
If I wanted to marry
a brawler, I would've.

172
00:09:27.485 --> 00:09:29.946
I know you don't like violence.

173
00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:32.407
It's not like I
care what he said.

174
00:09:55.222 --> 00:09:56.640
What are you doing up?

175
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.685
You want me to do
the thing, huh?

176
00:10:02.395 --> 00:10:04.189
Wait. Go.

177
00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:08.318
Wipey, wipey.

178
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:14.950
New record!

179
00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:34.009
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

180
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.220
Anniversary sex.

181
00:10:35.929 --> 00:10:37.096
I'm awake.

182
00:10:37.097 --> 00:10:38.847
I'm totally awake.

183
00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:41.100
I'm so sorry tonight was a bust.

184
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:43.686
- I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise.
- Oh, it's okay.

185
00:10:43.687 --> 00:10:45.188
It's okay.

186
00:10:46.231 --> 00:10:47.232
You know what?

187
00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:50.134
I should have kicked that guy's
ass for what he said to you.

188
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:52.444
Oh, God.

189
00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:54.614
You totally could've
taken him, honey.

190
00:10:58.618 --> 00:11:00.619
Oh, babe.

191
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.372
Sorry. I shouldn't have laughed.

192
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:08.461
Can we do this on Thursday?

193
00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:11.380
I'm so tired.

194
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:12.716
Yeah, sure.

195
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:15.885
I love you.

196
00:11:15.886 --> 00:11:17.470
I love you too.

197
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.146
Remember to block your faces.
You don't wanna lose them.

198
00:11:31.776 --> 00:11:33.319
Husband or boyfriend?

199
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.279
Teenage daughter.

200
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.822
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:36.823 --> 00:11:38.408
Okay, guys. Partner up.

202
00:11:41.661 --> 00:11:42.828
- You?
- Okay.

203
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:43.914
Cool.

204
00:11:45.332 --> 00:11:46.624
All right.

205
00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:49.251
I'm so bad at this.
I usually take barre,

206
00:11:49.252 --> 00:11:50.753
but I couldn't find
one in Buffalo.

207
00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:53.131
No, you're doing great.
Just keep your fists up.

208
00:11:53.715 --> 00:11:56.008
- Where's home?
- Nowhere, everywhere.

209
00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:59.304
- I'm in the travel business.
- Sounds so nice.

210
00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:01.305
Are you here for work?

211
00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:03.057
No, I'm here to see my ex.

212
00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:04.516
Now swap.

213
00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:05.976
Sorry, TMI.

214
00:12:05.977 --> 00:12:09.356
Don't worry about it. Just take it
out on the bag. That's what I do.

215
00:12:10.523 --> 00:12:13.068
- How old is your daughter?
- Seventeen.

216
00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:16.238
Oh, my God.

217
00:12:16.738 --> 00:12:19.240
I am so sorry

218
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.660
about that again.
How's it feeling?

219
00:12:22.327 --> 00:12:23.327
It's...

220
00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:25.579
No, it's fine. It's a story.

221
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.957
I got beat up by a physical
therapist at the gym.

222
00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:29.083
God.

223
00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:30.793
You have a mean right
hook, by the way.

224
00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.002
Thanks.

225
00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:33.213
Gosh.

226
00:12:33.964 --> 00:12:35.422
Okay. So, where were we?

227
00:12:35.423 --> 00:12:36.800
Three kids...

228
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.801
Three kids. Yeah.

229
00:12:38.802 --> 00:12:44.473
Yeah. Just when I thought I was sending
one off to college, along came Max.

230
00:12:44.474 --> 00:12:46.977
Adorable...

231
00:12:49.437 --> 00:12:50.522
What?

232
00:12:51.606 --> 00:12:55.151
I don't know. Sometimes I guess
I just feel like I'm a little...

233
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:57.403
I don't know, trapped?

234
00:12:57.404 --> 00:12:59.197
I know that sounds so awful.

235
00:13:00.365 --> 00:13:02.909
It's just that, Dan, my husband,

236
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:06.829
I mean, he's an
amazing dad, you know?

237
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.166
I guess he's just so
content being here.

238
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:13.043
In Buffalo?

239
00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:15.004
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

240
00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:16.547
- I didn't mean to...
- No.

241
00:13:16.548 --> 00:13:18.382
- Say it like that.
- That's true.

242
00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:21.469
I mean, when we met, I wanted to
travel. I wanted to see the world.

243
00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:25.180
But Dan's... He's just a
total homebody, you know?

244
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:28.767
He's so focused on the family, and I
do, I love that about him. He's amazing.

245
00:13:28.768 --> 00:13:30.312
I just wish our lives were...

246
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:33.356
bigger, you know? Just...

247
00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:37.359
I get it.

248
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.695
I'm sorry. Talk about TMI.

249
00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:43.073
No, I've got to catch
a flight, as always.

250
00:13:43.074 --> 00:13:46.577
But, listen. If you ever do
convince your husband to travel,

251
00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:49.122
I promise you, I'm better at
my job than I am at kickboxing.

252
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.750
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

253
00:13:57.429 --> 00:13:58.493
<i>Great news.</i>

254
00:13:58.518 --> 00:14:00.828
- <i>Today is Half-Price Wednesday...</i>
- You're about to go to size 4S, huh?

255
00:14:00.853 --> 00:14:03.345
Are you so big now,
huh? How big is Maxie?

256
00:14:05.931 --> 00:14:06.931
So big.

257
00:14:06.932 --> 00:14:08.391
Look at the big muscles.

258
00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:13.103
Okay, hold on.

259
00:14:13.104 --> 00:14:17.067
We're gonna get this for
Mama. And that. And that.

260
00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:19.319
You wanna get ice cream?

261
00:14:19.861 --> 00:14:21.613
Yeah, I'm gonna
get you ice cream.

262
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.326
Yeah?

263
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:30.996
Yeah. There it is.

264
00:14:30.997 --> 00:14:32.081
You want this one?

265
00:14:32.082 --> 00:14:33.667
I'll get you french fries.

266
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.050
Oh, shit.

267
00:14:45.804 --> 00:14:47.472
I'm so sorry about this, pal.

268
00:14:49.558 --> 00:14:50.684
Really?

269
00:14:55.564 --> 00:14:56.689
Hey, asshole.

270
00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:58.567
At least let me put my kid down.

271
00:15:10.203 --> 00:15:11.413
Oh, shit.

272
00:15:15.458 --> 00:15:17.251
- Daniel.
- I'm so sorry, Mrs. Overmeyer.

273
00:15:17.252 --> 00:15:18.378
Uh-oh.

274
00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:21.338
Oh, my God!

275
00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:22.340
Hey!

276
00:15:37.105 --> 00:15:38.982
I told you to let
me put my kid down!

277
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.201
I got 'em.

278
00:15:51.202 --> 00:15:53.663
<i>Cleaning team to
aisle three, please.</i>

279
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:57.541
Sorry about the mess.

280
00:15:57.542 --> 00:15:59.961
Thank you for shopping
at Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.

281
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.848
Hold on.

282
00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.938
Hey, Beau.

283
00:16:19.142 --> 00:16:21.561
- Hey, Dan.
- Have a good one.

284
00:16:22.204 --> 00:16:23.526
All right.

285
00:16:42.003 --> 00:16:43.838
Shit. The passports
are out of date.

286
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.724
From here on in, Daddy's
paying in cash, Maxie.

287
00:16:56.726 --> 00:16:57.851
<i>Hello?</i>

288
00:16:57.852 --> 00:16:59.728
Hey, don't hang up.

289
00:16:59.729 --> 00:17:01.814
How are you still alive?

290
00:17:01.815 --> 00:17:03.525
Yeah, it's nice to
hear your voice too.

291
00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:07.112
Look, I need new identities.
I'm burned. Full packets.

292
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:09.822
Me, my wife, and three kids.

293
00:17:09.823 --> 00:17:11.948
Three? How did that happen?

294
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:14.118
Do I really need to explain the
birds and the bees right now, Augie,

295
00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:15.370
or can we talk business?

296
00:17:16.496 --> 00:17:17.788
Oh, God.

297
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:19.541
You've got some
nerve calling me.

298
00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.709
McCaffrey scorched the
earth looking for you.

299
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.344
Yep. Looks like he's found me.

300
00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.620
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

301
00:17:25.645 --> 00:17:27.020
Social media, I guess.

302
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:28.257
<i>You idiot.</i>

303
00:17:29.593 --> 00:17:31.510
I had to leave my life behind.

304
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:36.057
Now I'm stuck in Tempe, Arizona, making
fake IDs for entitled college pricks.

305
00:17:37.058 --> 00:17:40.269
- Should I go?
- Oh, no. You can stay.

306
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.147
But given you're trying to look
like you're not in college,

307
00:17:43.148 --> 00:17:44.441
maybe try losing the hoodie?

308
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:47.871
Look, I'll pay you a
half a million in cash.

309
00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:50.846
<i>And you get Doris a condo in
one of those retirement places.</i>

310
00:17:51.281 --> 00:17:53.782
You know, the ones with the golf
carts, the wine and cheese happy hour,

311
00:17:53.783 --> 00:17:54.992
mah-jongg at six o'clock?

312
00:17:54.993 --> 00:17:56.452
Leave my mom out of this.

313
00:17:56.453 --> 00:17:58.746
- <i>She'll love it.</i>
- I can sell you out for twice that.

314
00:17:58.747 --> 00:18:00.415
Well, you haven't in 18 years.

315
00:18:00.916 --> 00:18:02.918
Meet me in Vegas in three days.

316
00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:07.838
I'll give you a time and a
place once I'm on the road.

317
00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.506
Vegas? Why Vegas?

318
00:18:09.507 --> 00:18:12.468
I can't tell my wife I'm taking
her on vacation to Tempe, Arizona.

319
00:18:12.469 --> 00:18:13.386
Vegas, I can sell.

320
00:18:13.387 --> 00:18:15.638
You haven't told
them? Are you mental?

321
00:18:15.639 --> 00:18:17.848
What, do you think it's that
easy? What am I meant to do?

322
00:18:17.849 --> 00:18:19.975
Sit them down and tell them the
whole story over French toast?

323
00:18:19.976 --> 00:18:22.561
<i>Oh, hey, kids. You know what?
Pass the maple syrup. By the way,</i>

324
00:18:22.562 --> 00:18:24.605
your dad was a
government assassin.

325
00:18:24.606 --> 00:18:27.126
I'll tell them when I'm on the
road and safe. Three days, Augie.

326
00:18:32.906 --> 00:18:34.032
Chess club.

327
00:18:40.622 --> 00:18:41.623
All right, come on.

328
00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:53.760
Where's Nina?

329
00:18:55.011 --> 00:18:56.929
Nina's not the editor
anymore. She quit.

330
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.348
What? When?

331
00:18:59.015 --> 00:19:00.099
Three months ago.

332
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.643
So, where is she now?

333
00:19:02.561 --> 00:19:03.769
I don't know.

334
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:04.937
All right, look.

335
00:19:04.938 --> 00:19:07.064
I'll give you 50 bucks for your
best guess of where Nina is.

336
00:19:07.065 --> 00:19:09.608
I'm a journalist. I
don't give people up.

337
00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:10.943
100.

338
00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:12.319
Try under the bleachers.

339
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.780
That's what I thought.

340
00:19:20.495 --> 00:19:24.206
I wrote my college essay on how
universities propagate systemic racism,

341
00:19:24.207 --> 00:19:25.416
and my mom shot it down.

342
00:19:25.417 --> 00:19:26.584
I was like, "Hello,

343
00:19:26.585 --> 00:19:27.793
that's how change happens."

344
00:19:27.794 --> 00:19:30.034
And she goes, "No, that's how
community college happens."

345
00:19:30.422 --> 00:19:31.506
Nina.

346
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:33.841
Dad, what are you doing here?

347
00:19:33.842 --> 00:19:36.010
This is a safe space. He
can't just come in here.

348
00:19:36.011 --> 00:19:37.095
Your dad's hot.

349
00:19:38.054 --> 00:19:39.805
Okay, Kelly. That's gross.

350
00:19:39.806 --> 00:19:41.307
You're meant to be in
an editorial meeting.

351
00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:43.309
Yeah, I am. I was.

352
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.269
- I...
- You quit three months ago.

353
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.521
How could you do that? You
worked so hard to become editor.

354
00:19:47.522 --> 00:19:49.773
- You don't even read my stuff.
- Of course I do.

355
00:19:49.774 --> 00:19:51.191
- I always do.
- Yeah. Bullshit.

356
00:19:51.192 --> 00:19:53.277
You know what? I don't have time
for this. Where's the chess club?

357
00:19:53.278 --> 00:19:55.362
- We need to find your brother.
- Can't you tell me what's going on?

358
00:19:55.363 --> 00:19:57.364
Nothing. I have a surprise
for the family, okay?

359
00:19:57.365 --> 00:19:59.992
- What's the surprise?
- Where is the chess club?

360
00:19:59.993 --> 00:20:02.369
It's in the math building.

361
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.663
Thank you, Kelly.

362
00:20:05.165 --> 00:20:07.083
- Dad, wait.
- What now?

363
00:20:08.168 --> 00:20:09.377
He's not there.

364
00:20:17.469 --> 00:20:18.636
Stay in the car.

365
00:20:18.637 --> 00:20:20.638
Oh, no. Forget it. I
am not missing this.

366
00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:22.557
- Missing what?
- Nothing.

367
00:20:23.767 --> 00:20:24.976
Go, go, go, go, go.

368
00:20:28.396 --> 00:20:30.147
- Shit.
- Are you Samir?

369
00:20:30.148 --> 00:20:31.983
- Yeah.
- I'm Kyle's dad. Is he here?

370
00:20:38.865 --> 00:20:40.282
What happened to chess club?

371
00:20:40.283 --> 00:20:42.076
It was canceled today.

372
00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:44.621
- Right, Samir?
- You don't pay me to lie.

373
00:20:45.163 --> 00:20:46.998
- You pay him?
- No, I...

374
00:20:49.251 --> 00:20:50.627
You don't need to... It's...

375
00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:56.298
- I can explain.
- Get in the car.

376
00:20:56.299 --> 00:20:58.593
- I...
- Get in the car.

377
00:20:59.177 --> 00:21:00.177
Let's go now.

378
00:21:02.931 --> 00:21:03.931
Traitor.

379
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.235
- So, what's the big surprise?
- We're going on a trip.

380
00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:18.112
I actually have plans
this weekend, so I...

381
00:21:18.113 --> 00:21:19.473
You're very grounded,
both of you.

382
00:21:29.356 --> 00:21:30.989
<i>Look, we're going up
there to get your mom.</i>

383
00:21:31.014 --> 00:21:33.307
You two are gonna show her nothing
but excitement for this trip,

384
00:21:33.332 --> 00:21:34.692
or I'm gonna tell her that
you've been lying to us,

385
00:21:34.717 --> 00:21:36.734
and you know how
that's gonna go down.

386
00:21:37.272 --> 00:21:38.564
Where are we even going?

387
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:39.673
<i>Vegas?</i>

388
00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:42.803
- We're going to Las Vegas today?
- Well, you said you wanted...

389
00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:44.138
- Now?
- To be more spontaneous.

390
00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:46.140
I heard you. And Jorge said
I could take a few days off.

391
00:21:46.141 --> 00:21:47.933
Is Jorge the one that does...

392
00:21:47.934 --> 00:21:50.978
- hydromassages on Tuesdays?
- No, Mrs. Kessler. Jorge is Dan's boss.

393
00:21:50.979 --> 00:21:54.857
- Is Dan giving me a hydromassage?
- No, Mrs. Kessler.

394
00:21:54.858 --> 00:21:56.108
There's no massages today.

395
00:21:56.109 --> 00:21:58.235
No. The kids have a long weekend,
and they're pumped. Right, guys?

396
00:21:58.236 --> 00:22:00.697
Guys, tell your mom how
pumped you are for this trip.

397
00:22:01.573 --> 00:22:03.575
- Yes!
- So pumped.

398
00:22:04.075 --> 00:22:06.493
Dan, we can't just
up and go to Vegas.

399
00:22:06.494 --> 00:22:08.370
I mean... And why Vegas?

400
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:12.291
I know it's not Europe, but there's
a Venice and an Eiffel Tower.

401
00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:14.877
You know what? I bet you we can
get last-minute Adele tickets.

402
00:22:14.878 --> 00:22:16.587
- You love Adele.
- You love Adele.

403
00:22:16.588 --> 00:22:18.339
Of course I love Adele.
Who doesn't love Adele?

404
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.216
- I love Adele.
- Everybody loves Adele.

405
00:22:20.217 --> 00:22:22.051
She's got the voice
of a freaking angel.

406
00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:24.511
Come on, Jess. What
is holding us back?

407
00:22:24.512 --> 00:22:27.681
Who are you? I mean, I
don't even recognize you.

408
00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:29.851
Well, you're gonna love
him. He's crazy in bed.

409
00:22:31.311 --> 00:22:32.853
Are you sure it's not Tuesday?

410
00:22:32.854 --> 00:22:35.856
You deserve a break. And I think this
could be really good for us as a family.

411
00:22:35.857 --> 00:22:37.608
And we're driving there?

412
00:22:37.609 --> 00:22:39.809
Well, nothing brings a family
together like a road trip.

413
00:22:41.363 --> 00:22:43.489
But we gotta go now. Before
the traffic gets bad.

414
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.116
And Mrs. Kessler, I'm so sorry. You
keep working on those deltoids, okay?

415
00:22:46.117 --> 00:22:48.077
- Thanks, Jorge.
- What about our stuff?

416
00:22:48.078 --> 00:22:50.454
- I mean, I need to pack, the baby. It's...
- Oh, no.

417
00:22:50.455 --> 00:22:52.581
I got all the basics packed
already. Yeah. When we get there,

418
00:22:52.582 --> 00:22:55.167
we're gonna use the money that we
saved on flights to go all <i>Pretty Woman</i>

419
00:22:55.168 --> 00:22:56.585
in those fancy
hotel boutiques...

420
00:22:56.586 --> 00:22:58.379
- that smell like leather and patchouli.
- Stop.

421
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.715
And guess who's got no budget?
You get whatever you want.

422
00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.052
Okay. This is totally crazy.

423
00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:06.637
- Dan, this is crazy.
- I know. It's crazy.

424
00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:07.930
- Oh, my God.
- We're gonna get crazy.

425
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:09.474
We're going to Vegas!

426
00:23:10.642 --> 00:23:11.850
Do we have snacks?

427
00:23:11.851 --> 00:23:13.227
Let's just get out
there on the road,

428
00:23:13.228 --> 00:23:14.896
and then we can
make a stop and...

429
00:23:19.859 --> 00:23:22.945
I think I'm gonna take a shortcut.
Save us a little bit of time.

430
00:23:22.946 --> 00:23:24.364
What?

431
00:23:29.494 --> 00:23:30.537
Go, go, go!

432
00:23:31.538 --> 00:23:33.872
- Shit.
- It's a shortcut. You never take Elmwood?

433
00:23:33.873 --> 00:23:34.873
Shit.

434
00:23:43.508 --> 00:23:44.718
All right. We're off.

435
00:23:51.892 --> 00:23:53.143
Hey, Maxie.

436
00:23:53.727 --> 00:23:54.978
- First road trip.
- Yeah.

437
00:23:56.062 --> 00:23:57.897
Max, you excited?

438
00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:01.066
Five hours on a plane,
or 33 hours in a car?

439
00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:02.235
I choose 33 hours.

440
00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:04.279
Da!

441
00:24:12.078 --> 00:24:13.871
Honey, you remembered my boots!

442
00:24:13.872 --> 00:24:15.748
- Yeah.
- Baby!

443
00:24:15.749 --> 00:24:16.917
I can't believe that.

444
00:24:23.256 --> 00:24:25.633
- Oh, my God. Jesus. Dad.
- Jesus.

445
00:24:25.634 --> 00:24:27.426
- Easy there, lead-foot.
- Sorry about that.

446
00:24:27.427 --> 00:24:29.627
Think a squirrel or something
jumped out in front of me.

447
00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:33.224
Oh, my God.

448
00:24:33.225 --> 00:24:36.143
- Where on earth are you taking us?
- What? Oh, no. This is a shortcut, honey.

449
00:24:36.144 --> 00:24:37.437
You never take it?

450
00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:40.189
Shit.

451
00:24:43.568 --> 00:24:44.778
He's tracking us.

452
00:24:45.362 --> 00:24:46.445
Oh, nothing.

453
00:24:46.446 --> 00:24:47.572
Nothing, honey.

454
00:24:56.831 --> 00:25:00.377
You know what? Actually, I gotta stop
and check something at work real quick.

455
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.222
- Is that Hal?
- Yeah. He's got a new mustache.

456
00:25:13.223 --> 00:25:15.303
- You work with that guy?
- It will just be a second.

457
00:25:20.647 --> 00:25:22.367
I think there's a service
area to the right.

458
00:25:32.284 --> 00:25:35.829
All right. If you guys just give
me a second, I'll be right there.

459
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.628
- Dad, what the hell?
- Language, Nina.

460
00:25:44.754 --> 00:25:46.088
Dan, what the hell?

461
00:25:46.089 --> 00:25:47.673
Oh, well, we're
driving 2,000 miles.

462
00:25:47.674 --> 00:25:49.593
We've gotta change the
oil, check the coolant,

463
00:25:50.844 --> 00:25:52.094
pop a little extra
air in the tires.

464
00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.889
I'd hate to be halfway across the desert
and wish we'd checked that coolant, right?

465
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:57.017
Can we not be in the car for it?

466
00:26:01.563 --> 00:26:03.523
Okay, he's stopped.
He's right ahead of us.

467
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.546
He should be here.

468
00:26:35.013 --> 00:26:37.181
Hey, guys. Just hang
in there for a minute.

469
00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:38.266
Dan?

470
00:26:39.226 --> 00:26:40.809
Mom, when we're in Vegas,

471
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.479
- can I go to HyperX?
- No, you're not going to a strip club.

472
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.064
- It's not a strip club.
- Why are you laughing?

473
00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:46.273
You're not gambling, Nina.

474
00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:47.816
- Do you have a fake ID?
- I'm not being... No.

475
00:26:47.817 --> 00:26:49.151
Dan!

476
00:26:49.152 --> 00:26:51.779
Hey, Hal. Nice wheels.

477
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.113
- She just come in?
- Yeah.

478
00:26:53.114 --> 00:26:54.865
I was thinking about
opening her up a little bit.

479
00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:58.160
Oh, man. I tell you what.
She wants to go fast.

480
00:26:58.161 --> 00:26:59.328
Cars are like chicks, man.

481
00:26:59.329 --> 00:27:01.664
- Yes! Right.
- Get her on the freeway.

482
00:27:01.665 --> 00:27:03.792
You open her up. And you
get a ticket, it's on me.

483
00:27:09.381 --> 00:27:11.675
I got him. He's on the
move. He's heading west.

484
00:27:16.596 --> 00:27:17.680
Hey, guys.

485
00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:18.847
- Yes?
- We're ready.

486
00:27:18.848 --> 00:27:21.100
Are we going to Vegas, or are
we just gonna live up here?

487
00:27:21.101 --> 00:27:22.644
We're on our way, honey.

488
00:27:50.505 --> 00:27:53.758
- Honey, aren't your feet cold?
- I don't care. I am on vacation.

489
00:27:54.843 --> 00:27:55.843
What are you doing?

490
00:27:55.844 --> 00:27:57.387
I'm posting about our trip.

491
00:27:58.305 --> 00:28:00.598
Look, do we really need to be
posting and tweeting and TikToking?

492
00:28:00.599 --> 00:28:01.974
In my day, road trips were
all about interaction.

493
00:28:01.975 --> 00:28:04.059
No, Dad. Please. I can't deal
with a dad lecture right now.

494
00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.645
You literally don't even know how to
text, so your opinion doesn't count.

495
00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:08.647
I'm serious. This should be
a device-free vacation, okay?

496
00:28:08.648 --> 00:28:09.732
Give them up, now.

497
00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:10.983
- What?
- Seriously.

498
00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:12.443
- What?
- Give it up. Now.

499
00:28:12.444 --> 00:28:15.947
- Jess, a little help?
- Okay, you heard him. Hand 'em over.

500
00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:18.617
Yours too.

501
00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:22.536
All right. Mine too. All of
us, okay? Solidarity! Bye!

502
00:28:22.537 --> 00:28:27.083
No!

503
00:28:31.504 --> 00:28:33.464
No, no, no. Dad.

504
00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:35.341
- No way you just did that. What?
- Oh, my God, Dad.

505
00:28:35.342 --> 00:28:37.676
I've just freed our family
from the shackles of technology

506
00:28:37.677 --> 00:28:39.470
- with a flick of my wrist. Just like that.
- Stop the car.

507
00:28:39.471 --> 00:28:42.556
And trust me, it's gonna bring us
all closer together. Just you wait.

508
00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:44.016
You've lost your mind.

509
00:28:44.017 --> 00:28:46.269
- Oh, my God.
- Whatever. I'll just buy myself a new one.

510
00:28:47.103 --> 00:28:48.270
What, like you buy your friends?

511
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.272
- Look, Samir is a business associate.
- Oh, yeah.

512
00:28:50.273 --> 00:28:52.358
- Look. At least they're talking.
- Do you wanna tell Mom and Dad

513
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.943
- about all your business endeavors?
- I don't give a...

514
00:28:53.944 --> 00:28:55.569
I've got a question for
you, Mr. Spontaneous.

515
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.323
Without our phones, how are we
gonna know where we're going?

516
00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:00.741
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.

517
00:29:00.742 --> 00:29:03.452
It's not a joke. We're going on
a family road trip. We need maps.

518
00:29:03.453 --> 00:29:05.330
Dude, why don't you
just, like, you know...

519
00:29:07.165 --> 00:29:09.458
Yeah, Dad. Why?

520
00:29:09.459 --> 00:29:11.794
Because he was trying to
promote familial bonding

521
00:29:11.795 --> 00:29:13.838
through the forcible
removal of technology.

522
00:29:14.673 --> 00:29:16.967
Look, I need travel help.
Isn't this what you do?

523
00:29:17.717 --> 00:29:19.344
Not for a long time.

524
00:29:22.013 --> 00:29:23.639
What's your destination?

525
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.807
Las Vegas.

526
00:29:24.808 --> 00:29:26.517
I'm also going to need help
with some reservations,

527
00:29:26.518 --> 00:29:28.728
if that's not too much of
an inconvenience for you.

528
00:29:29.854 --> 00:29:32.732
Okay. Here you go.

529
00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:35.318
All right.

530
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:42.866
- I'm gonna need a credit card.
- You know what? Here's my membership card.

531
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:45.327
I think you'll see I've got
a few rewards points there.

532
00:29:45.328 --> 00:29:46.704
That's not really how it works.

533
00:29:46.705 --> 00:29:48.247
- It's like a whole thing.
- I get it.

534
00:29:48.248 --> 00:29:50.875
Maybe with all those points, I
don't even need a credit card.

535
00:29:53.253 --> 00:29:54.920
What do you think,
Levon? Are we good?

536
00:29:54.921 --> 00:29:56.255
How many points do we have?

537
00:29:56.256 --> 00:29:59.509
Looks like you are platinum
elite superior diamond members.

538
00:30:00.051 --> 00:30:01.845
And I would love
to help you today.

00:31:02.697 --> 00:31:04.157
Call in everybody.

557
00:31:04.658 --> 00:31:06.784
The Swedes, Gunther, Spiros.

558
00:31:06.785 --> 00:31:09.745
- I want 'em found.
- Well, there's no hits on their cards.

559
00:31:09.746 --> 00:31:11.205
Must be using cash.

560
00:31:11.206 --> 00:31:13.499
I've been tracking their
socials, but nothing so far.

561
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.085
Must have turned
their phones off.

562
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:18.462
Hey, his kid's a
gamer called Kyllboi.

563
00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:19.673
He's pretty good.

564
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.593
Get eyes on the road,
and find that minivan.

565
00:31:24.594 --> 00:31:26.011
You got it, boss.

566
00:31:26.012 --> 00:31:28.681
Be tough for him to switch cars
without tipping off the family.

567
00:31:28.682 --> 00:31:31.242
- What makes you think they don't know?
- They're still with him.

568
00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.737
Look at you. You're
in withdrawal.

569
00:31:43.738 --> 00:31:46.824
Can you really not go, like, one day
without blowing people's brains out?

570
00:31:46.825 --> 00:31:48.158
I have a brand to manage.

571
00:31:48.159 --> 00:31:50.911
A desensitized cog in
the violence-obsessed

572
00:31:50.912 --> 00:31:52.746
capitalist machine is a brand?

573
00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:53.956
Oh, good. Trevor's here.

574
00:31:53.957 --> 00:31:56.835
Do you even remember what
your own personality is like?

575
00:31:57.419 --> 00:31:58.419
No.

576
00:32:00.505 --> 00:32:01.631
You used to be cool.

577
00:32:05.677 --> 00:32:08.762
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

578
00:32:08.763 --> 00:32:10.473
Well, yeah. I've
seen you on Twitch.

579
00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:13.934
You're the guy who took down
Synapse live on his own stream!

580
00:32:13.935 --> 00:32:15.353
You're Kyllboi. Right?

581
00:32:16.354 --> 00:32:17.855
You know about that?

582
00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:19.940
Yeah. Dude, that was badass.

583
00:32:19.941 --> 00:32:21.276
Can I get a picture?

584
00:32:22.068 --> 00:32:23.068
Sure.

585
00:32:24.362 --> 00:32:27.406
Jess, I don't know
how to tell you this,

586
00:32:27.407 --> 00:32:30.410
but when we get to Vegas,
we're not coming home.

587
00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:33.496
The truth is, I haven't
been completely hon...

588
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:36.874
The truth is, when we met...

589
00:32:36.875 --> 00:32:38.460
Before I met...

590
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.009
All right, here we go.
We've got rooms 152 and 153.

591
00:32:46.885 --> 00:32:49.261
Can I get four of those
disposable cameras too, please?

592
00:32:49.262 --> 00:32:50.347
Yeah.

593
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:52.556
Here you go.

594
00:32:52.557 --> 00:32:54.559
- Thank you. Keep the change.
- Thank you.

595
00:32:58.438 --> 00:33:00.439
You're awesome, dude. For real.

596
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.857
I mean, thank you.

597
00:33:01.858 --> 00:33:04.360
I mean, this is literally
the worst ever...

598
00:33:04.361 --> 00:33:05.445
I'm gonna get you.

599
00:33:05.946 --> 00:33:07.071
I'm gonna get you!

600
00:33:07.072 --> 00:33:08.906
All right. Here, kiddo.
Go make some memories.

601
00:33:08.907 --> 00:33:11.283
Yeah, I'm... I don't know, this is...
It's just a weird experience for me.

602
00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:13.953
- That's so cool I ran into you.
- Look at your brother. He's made a friend.

603
00:33:13.954 --> 00:33:15.580
- Can you do the thing?
- Yeah.

604
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.100
- Awesome. Thanks, Kyllboi.
- Thank you.

605
00:33:20.335 --> 00:33:22.545
- Hey, what was all this about?
- That's a really good question.

606
00:33:22.546 --> 00:33:24.964
- What was that about?
- Yeah, and who's Kyllboi?

607
00:33:24.965 --> 00:33:27.883
You know, that sounds familiar.
I feel like I know who that is.

608
00:33:27.884 --> 00:33:29.385
- That's...
- No one.

609
00:33:29.386 --> 00:33:30.844
- It's nothing.
- Oh, my God.

610
00:33:30.845 --> 00:33:32.137
- It's not important.
- He's Kyllboi.

611
00:33:32.138 --> 00:33:34.348
It's his gamer tag.
He never quit gaming.

612
00:33:34.349 --> 00:33:36.308
He thinks he's, like,
famous or something now.

613
00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:37.476
Really?

614
00:33:37.477 --> 00:33:40.229
- Big boy!
- Da.

615
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.148
- Da?
- Is she gonna post that picture?

616
00:33:42.774 --> 00:33:44.650
- Probably, yeah.
- Hey!

617
00:33:44.651 --> 00:33:46.152
Did you get some rooms?

618
00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:48.946
No. They're all booked.
We gotta keep going.

619
00:33:48.947 --> 00:33:50.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

620
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:15.931
It's them.

621
00:34:21.646 --> 00:34:22.731
Let's go.

622
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.258
- What was that?
- Hey, honey.

623
00:36:56.259 --> 00:36:58.136
Just a little bit
of a pothole there.

624
00:37:00.597 --> 00:37:04.434
Max, did you see that?
That guy was flying.

625
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.372
Oh, my God.

626
00:37:26.373 --> 00:37:28.166
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

627
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.044
- Where are we?
- Iowa.

628
00:37:32.045 --> 00:37:33.629
- Iowa?
- Yeah.

629
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.005
Wait. Did you drive all night?

630
00:37:35.006 --> 00:37:36.590
Well, what can I say?

631
00:37:36.591 --> 00:37:39.343
I was so damn excited
I couldn't sleep.

632
00:37:39.344 --> 00:37:41.262
I mean, I kept getting second
winds. More like fifth winds.

633
00:37:41.263 --> 00:37:43.639
- And then, before you know it, bam.
- God.

634
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.848
We're in Iowa City.

635
00:37:44.849 --> 00:37:46.433
That's not a real cow, honey.

636
00:37:46.434 --> 00:37:47.852
- Okay?
- Oh, my God.

637
00:37:48.728 --> 00:37:50.521
Oh, my God. Did you just
say we're in Iowa City?

638
00:37:50.522 --> 00:37:51.647
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, honey.

639
00:37:51.648 --> 00:37:54.066
That means we're literally,
like, half an inch from SIU.

640
00:37:54.067 --> 00:37:55.401
We can stop and...

641
00:37:55.402 --> 00:37:57.404
We are not gonna stop
and see Trevor, okay?

642
00:37:57.988 --> 00:38:01.240
Actually, I meant that I wanted
to see campus, but whatever.

643
00:38:01.241 --> 00:38:03.659
Right. 'Cause you're really
interested in seeing the facilities.

644
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.244
- Yeah. Actually, I am.
- Are you serious?

645
00:38:05.245 --> 00:38:07.705
Are we gonna argue about this? About
you following a boy to college?

646
00:38:07.706 --> 00:38:09.290
- I'm not following a boy to col...
- Guys.

647
00:38:09.291 --> 00:38:10.833
You're gonna go
for three months...

648
00:38:10.834 --> 00:38:12.835
- Guys.
- It's the college that I want to go to.

649
00:38:12.836 --> 00:38:14.295
Obviously, I would want
to go see the campus.

650
00:38:14.296 --> 00:38:16.922
- Why do you wanna go?
- We're so far from home.

651
00:38:16.923 --> 00:38:18.507
This place is gorgeous.

652
00:38:18.508 --> 00:38:20.302
How could you not
want me to come here?

653
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:25.431
I cannot believe that
you are encouraging this.

654
00:38:25.432 --> 00:38:27.516
Look, it wouldn't hurt for us
to be off the road for a bit.

655
00:38:27.517 --> 00:38:30.185
Besides, I mean, maybe if
we want her to listen to us,

656
00:38:30.186 --> 00:38:31.937
we gotta start
listening to her more.

657
00:38:31.938 --> 00:38:34.607
Let her look around.
It's safe, nice.

658
00:38:34.608 --> 00:38:38.403
And besides, it'll give
us a chance to talk.

659
00:38:46.745 --> 00:38:49.873
Okay. You wanna find out what
college life is really about?

660
00:38:51.166 --> 00:38:52.208
Follow me.

661
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.138
This takes me back.

662
00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:10.517
- It's like a toxic masculinity convention.
- It's called school spirit, Nina.

663
00:39:10.518 --> 00:39:13.558
Yeah, okay. You're not the one who's
gonna get flipped over in a porta-potty.

664
00:39:15.065 --> 00:39:16.607
Well, it's pretty
festive. Do you like it?

665
00:39:16.608 --> 00:39:19.236
- Yeah. It's cool.
- Yes.

666
00:39:21.279 --> 00:39:23.531
Hey, sexy. You want me to show
you how to do a keg stand?

667
00:39:28.912 --> 00:39:30.372
Sorry. I didn't
realize you were...

668
00:39:31.748 --> 00:39:32.916
a mom.

669
00:39:35.377 --> 00:39:36.377
Nina.

670
00:39:37.337 --> 00:39:38.504
Do you mind?

671
00:39:38.505 --> 00:39:40.131
Okay. Here you go.

672
00:39:41.925 --> 00:39:43.050
Yep.

673
00:39:43.051 --> 00:39:44.218
Oh, my God.

674
00:39:44.219 --> 00:39:46.596
- Yo! Come through. She's gonna do it.
- Mom!

675
00:39:48.098 --> 00:39:49.099
Mom!

676
00:39:49.683 --> 00:39:50.725
I can't...

677
00:40:02.487 --> 00:40:04.905
- Beer me!
- Come on! Yeah!

678
00:40:04.906 --> 00:40:08.409
Chug! Chug! Chug!

679
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.745
Chug! Chug! Chug!

680
00:40:11.746 --> 00:40:12.998
Chug! Chug!

681
00:40:24.843 --> 00:40:27.761
- Don't you ever try anything like that.
- Mom, that was...

682
00:40:27.762 --> 00:40:29.930
that was awesome, actually. I...

683
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:31.016
"Beer me"?

684
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.603
Let's get out of here
before I get too competitive

685
00:40:35.604 --> 00:40:37.813
- and start kicking ass at beer pong.
- Oh, my God.

686
00:40:37.814 --> 00:40:39.316
I wonder what that looks like.

687
00:40:40.233 --> 00:40:42.234
I hope you all enjoyed
seeing the library.

688
00:40:42.235 --> 00:40:43.903
First time for me too.

689
00:40:43.904 --> 00:40:45.988
- Hey, guys. Look. There's a tour.
- And you know...

690
00:40:45.989 --> 00:40:48.657
Let's slip in the back and pretend like
we were a part of the group all along.

691
00:40:48.658 --> 00:40:49.950
- Do we have to?
- Yeah.

692
00:40:49.951 --> 00:40:51.243
We're here to
support your sister.

693
00:40:51.244 --> 00:40:53.120
If you're questioning that,
you get to strap on Max.

694
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:54.788
- Let's go.
- Next up,

695
00:40:54.789 --> 00:40:58.126
we'll head on over to visit our
state-of-the-art athletic facilities.

696
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.463
I'm sorry that I ratted you out.

697
00:41:01.963 --> 00:41:04.215
It's just, it drives me crazy
that you get away with so much,

698
00:41:04.216 --> 00:41:07.551
and I get yelled at constantly just
because you guys don't get Trevor.

699
00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:08.928
We get Trevor.

700
00:41:08.929 --> 00:41:10.555
- We don't like Trevor.
- Why?

701
00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:14.713
Ever since you've been dating him, you've
been like a completely different person.

702
00:41:16.019 --> 00:41:17.354
I liked you better before.

703
00:41:18.063 --> 00:41:20.232
Plus, he treats you like
shit. You deserve more.

704
00:41:23.235 --> 00:41:27.112
Is that, like, genuine
concern for my feelings?

705
00:41:27.113 --> 00:41:28.907
No. God, no. Gross.

706
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.911
I wonder what's going
on in your mind.

707
00:41:33.912 --> 00:41:35.663
It's just... I don't know.

708
00:41:35.664 --> 00:41:37.916
Another blast from the past.

709
00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.001
You think you can still do it?

710
00:41:40.502 --> 00:41:44.089
No. Not unless I wanted
to end up in the hospital.

711
00:41:44.798 --> 00:41:48.342
It's just... It's funny to think
how different my life would be

712
00:41:48.343 --> 00:41:50.469
if I hadn't torn my ACL.

713
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:53.222
- Well, do you want it to be different?
- No. God, no.

714
00:41:53.223 --> 00:41:55.849
It's just... You know,
it's just strange.

715
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.810
You've never even met
that version of me.

716
00:41:57.811 --> 00:42:00.479
You just know Jessica,
the physical therapist.

717
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.064
Well, I love every
version of you.

718
00:42:02.065 --> 00:42:04.400
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Especially that keg stand one.

719
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:05.776
It was so freaking hot.

720
00:42:05.777 --> 00:42:07.654
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.

721
00:42:08.572 --> 00:42:10.615
Did you ever have sex
on the pole-vault mat?

722
00:42:13.785 --> 00:42:15.954
- Don't answer that. Oh, my.
- God.

723
00:42:16.746 --> 00:42:19.832
You have been acting so
weird this whole trip.

724
00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:22.668
But I gotta tell you, I'm
kind of into spontaneous Dan.

725
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:26.088
Well, you know, Jess. I mean, we all
have different versions of ourselves.

726
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:27.632
- And sometimes, you just...
- Yeah.

727
00:42:28.216 --> 00:42:30.009
That guy with the gold chain.

728
00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:31.803
He wasn't with the group before.

729
00:42:32.554 --> 00:42:33.889
- Okay.
- What's he doing?

730
00:42:38.393 --> 00:42:40.562
Well, they grow up fast,
huh? Which one is yours?

731
00:42:41.313 --> 00:42:43.440
My daughter is
back in Stuttgart.

732
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.484
- I look at school for her.
- Wow. That's a hike.

733
00:42:47.068 --> 00:42:48.485
I have business here.

734
00:42:48.486 --> 00:42:51.405
Chemistry, astronomy,
astrophysics...

735
00:42:51.406 --> 00:42:53.325
Hey, you mentioned
having business in Iowa.

736
00:42:53.825 --> 00:42:55.118
What business would that be?

737
00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:57.578
- Corn.
- Yeah?

738
00:42:57.579 --> 00:42:58.871
That's what's in the case?

739
00:42:58.872 --> 00:42:59.956
Of course.

740
00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:03.667
- Ladies.
- Thanks.

741
00:43:03.668 --> 00:43:05.921
- After you.
- No, I insist.

742
00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:09.137
- Dan?
- Hey, honey.

743
00:43:09.162 --> 00:43:10.028
- Coming?
- Yeah.

744
00:43:10.053 --> 00:43:12.864
I'm just getting to know this fella here.
All the way from Stuttgart, Germany.

745
00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:15.596
You know, I had a pen pal from
Stuttgart back in high school.

746
00:43:15.597 --> 00:43:17.389
I even learned a little German.

747
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.642
Nobody needs to know.

748
00:43:19.643 --> 00:43:22.394
If you want to speak
about what's in the case,

749
00:43:22.395 --> 00:43:24.189
it will stay between us.

750
00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:27.441
What did you just say?

751
00:43:27.442 --> 00:43:28.609
"Where's the discotheque?"

752
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.986
Right. Okay.

753
00:43:30.987 --> 00:43:32.546
Don't worry, honey.
We'll catch up, okay?

754
00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:34.699
- All right, honey.
- Goodbye, my love.

755
00:43:37.994 --> 00:43:39.495
Fine. You wanna dance.

756
00:43:39.496 --> 00:43:41.081
Let's see what's in the case.

757
00:43:45.627 --> 00:43:47.711
- What the hell is that?
- Heirloom corn.

758
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:49.214
I thought I made this clear.

759
00:43:49.729 --> 00:43:51.882
So, you're just German?

760
00:43:51.883 --> 00:43:53.343
Yes, exactly.

761
00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:55.595
Oh, shit.

762
00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:21.954
- Biology labs are over there.
- Where's Dad?

763
00:44:21.955 --> 00:44:24.666
- Physics labs are down there.
- He's talking to some German guy.

764
00:44:26.251 --> 00:44:28.169
We have our chemistry
labs right here.

765
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.427
Never a dull moment in
the labs. Moving on.

766
00:44:36.428 --> 00:44:37.511
Let me show you

767
00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:40.056
the biggest Van de Graaff
generator in the Midwest.

768
00:45:43.745 --> 00:45:46.914
So, I hope you've all enjoyed
this tour of our wonderful campus.

769
00:45:46.915 --> 00:45:48.749
I know I have.

770
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.709
- Hey. It's getting late.
- Hey.

771
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:52.503
- We should probably get back on the road.
- Yeah.

772
00:45:52.504 --> 00:45:55.839
- Where's Nina?
- I said she could go say hi to Trevor.

773
00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.467
It felt cruel to deny her.

774
00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.427
It's okay. She'll be back soon.

775
00:46:00.428 --> 00:46:02.764
Yeah. No. I'm not
worried at all.

776
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:11.815
Okay.

777
00:46:13.358 --> 00:46:14.609
Go away, Josh.

778
00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:16.819
It's me.

779
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.280
Me who?

780
00:46:19.281 --> 00:46:20.365
Nina.

781
00:46:23.076 --> 00:46:25.327
Hey. What are you doing here?

782
00:46:25.328 --> 00:46:26.912
It's, like, a really long story.

783
00:46:26.913 --> 00:46:28.455
But, can I come in?

784
00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:30.082
You know what?

785
00:46:30.083 --> 00:46:32.543
Give me just one sec, and
I'll throw on some pants,

786
00:46:32.544 --> 00:46:34.212
and me and you
can grab a matcha.

787
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.048
Oh, my God.

788
00:46:38.049 --> 00:46:39.508
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on a second.

789
00:46:39.509 --> 00:46:43.262
Oh, my God. You're
cheating on me.

790
00:46:43.263 --> 00:46:47.641
Monogamy is just a construct of our
Western repressive civilization.

791
00:46:47.642 --> 00:46:48.726
Oh, my God.

792
00:46:48.727 --> 00:46:51.979
I thought we were on
the same page on that.

793
00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.064
All right.

794
00:46:53.857 --> 00:46:54.940
Honey, what happened?

795
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:56.860
He's an asshole.
That's what happened.

796
00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.862
"Monogamy is just a
construct"... Who even says that?

797
00:46:59.863 --> 00:47:01.363
- Trevor.
- Oh, baby. I'm so sorry.

798
00:47:01.364 --> 00:47:02.781
Can we just go?

799
00:47:02.782 --> 00:47:04.492
That's a great idea,
honey. Let's go.

800
00:47:09.247 --> 00:47:10.248
Hey, Beans.

801
00:47:11.541 --> 00:47:14.127
Look, I'm sorry. You know,
when I was your age, I...

802
00:47:15.045 --> 00:47:16.922
You don't need another
dad lecture, do you?

803
00:47:21.009 --> 00:47:22.135
Hey, Beans.

804
00:47:23.553 --> 00:47:25.429
You ever hear of Kyusho Jitsu?

805
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:27.514
- Kyusho what?
- Kyusho Jitsu.

806
00:47:27.515 --> 00:47:30.809
It's a 13th-century martial
art that uses pressure points

807
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.437
to inflict extreme pain
without permanent damage.

808
00:47:33.438 --> 00:47:35.190
How do you even know about that?

809
00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:38.652
Well, maybe there's more to
your old man than you thought.

810
00:47:43.907 --> 00:47:46.910
Nina, you gotta let go
of these stereotypical...

811
00:47:51.498 --> 00:47:53.916
How was that for
"stereotypical,"

812
00:47:53.917 --> 00:48:00.298
you unbearably pompous, bloviating
piece of sanctimonious shit?

813
00:48:02.008 --> 00:48:03.134
Smile.

814
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:06.137
You deserve more.

815
00:48:20.902 --> 00:48:23.612
- What did you say to her?
- It was just a dad lecture.

816
00:48:23.613 --> 00:48:25.031
God.

817
00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:40.582
What happened to the mirror?

818
00:48:41.548 --> 00:48:42.549
The mirror.

819
00:48:43.425 --> 00:48:45.217
- You didn't hear that?
- No.

820
00:48:45.218 --> 00:48:48.220
It was a semi. It went flying by. The
guy must have been doing a hundred.

821
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:49.513
And rocks just come

822
00:48:49.514 --> 00:48:50.806
- spitting out of the tire.
- Jesus.

823
00:48:50.807 --> 00:48:52.976
One hit there. It almost
hit the windshield.

824
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:09.034
What the...

825
00:49:12.537 --> 00:49:13.537
We got him.

826
00:49:13.538 --> 00:49:14.747
We really got you.

827
00:49:14.748 --> 00:49:16.666
You were so scared.

828
00:49:41.441 --> 00:49:44.402
So, did you tell Mom
that I quit the paper?

829
00:49:47.113 --> 00:49:48.323
No. Did you want me to?

830
00:49:50.325 --> 00:49:51.408
I was kidding.

831
00:49:51.409 --> 00:49:52.827
No. I...

832
00:49:53.453 --> 00:49:57.582
I was just kind of thinking about
maybe getting my position back.

833
00:49:59.626 --> 00:50:02.504
Yeah? That's cool.

834
00:50:03.255 --> 00:50:04.839
Only do it if you want to.

835
00:50:05.882 --> 00:50:07.133
I gotta tell you, Beans.

836
00:50:07.926 --> 00:50:10.470
You've got a hell of a voice,
and it deserves to be heard.

837
00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:15.474
Hey. No BS. All right?

838
00:50:15.475 --> 00:50:17.768
I'm serious. That piece you
wrote about pervasive corruption

839
00:50:17.769 --> 00:50:21.064
in the Board of Education...
My God. I got chills.

840
00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.190
You actually read that?

841
00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:24.526
Of course I did.

842
00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.111
Come on. I'm your
biggest fan, Beans.

843
00:50:27.112 --> 00:50:29.030
Always have been,
and I always will be.

844
00:50:29.948 --> 00:50:31.074
And so is your mom.

845
00:50:32.075 --> 00:50:33.285
And so are your brothers.

846
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.495
Max just hasn't told you yet.

847
00:50:38.748 --> 00:50:39.915
Oh, a smile.

848
00:50:39.916 --> 00:50:41.375
Wow. Holy shit.

849
00:50:41.376 --> 00:50:43.586
- Oh, my God.
- No, I didn't.

850
00:50:43.587 --> 00:50:45.462
That was... No.

851
00:50:45.463 --> 00:50:47.215
I mean it. I'm proud of you.

852
00:50:48.508 --> 00:50:49.509
Thanks.

853
00:51:03.732 --> 00:51:05.901
Max is fed and settled
in the kids' room.

854
00:51:06.484 --> 00:51:08.403
I am so ready for a real bed.

855
00:51:13.325 --> 00:51:14.367
What?

856
00:51:16.828 --> 00:51:17.828
Nothing.

857
00:51:24.169 --> 00:51:25.545
- Hey now.
- Hey.

858
00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:27.422
You wanna lose that?

859
00:51:32.677 --> 00:51:33.720
Wait.

860
00:51:34.304 --> 00:51:35.513
It's not Thursday.

861
00:51:39.643 --> 00:51:40.643
Okay.

862
00:51:45.232 --> 00:51:46.608
Fuck.

863
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:53.031
Wow.

864
00:51:53.531 --> 00:51:55.200
What was that?

865
00:51:56.618 --> 00:52:00.288
That felt like... That felt...

866
00:52:01.873 --> 00:52:02.915
That was long overdue.

867
00:52:02.916 --> 00:52:04.334
That was...

868
00:52:05.293 --> 00:52:07.796
- That's what that was.
- That felt...

869
00:52:08.797 --> 00:52:10.381
That felt different.

870
00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:12.175
- Different good, I hope.
- Different like...

871
00:52:12.884 --> 00:52:15.345
I was cheating on
Dan with other Dan.

872
00:52:16.346 --> 00:52:19.390
- That different.
- No. I mean... No. It was...

873
00:52:19.391 --> 00:52:22.394
Don't get me wrong. That
was so hot. That was like...

874
00:52:23.687 --> 00:52:24.980
What got into you?

875
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:27.481
I don't know.

876
00:52:27.482 --> 00:52:29.150
Maybe it's being away, or...

877
00:52:30.443 --> 00:52:34.781
maybe it was seeing you upside-down
on that keg shouting, "Beer me!"

878
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:42.247
Is this what you
used to be like?

879
00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:44.249
Other Dan.

880
00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:47.168
Did you change because of me?

881
00:52:49.796 --> 00:52:50.797
No.

882
00:52:52.007 --> 00:52:56.344
Look, I changed because I
didn't like who I was back then.

883
00:52:57.262 --> 00:52:58.513
Then I met you.

884
00:53:00.056 --> 00:53:01.266
Then I became a dad.

885
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:05.312
And for the first time in
a long time, I felt good.

886
00:53:05.896 --> 00:53:07.479
I just took it too far.

887
00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.023
I got too comfortable. Too safe.

888
00:53:09.024 --> 00:53:11.609
- And that probably came across as boring...
- Well...

889
00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.027
- and maybe neglectful...
- for what it's worth...

890
00:53:13.028 --> 00:53:16.071
- and I'll never do that again.
- I really like both Dans.

891
00:53:16.072 --> 00:53:17.489
- Do you?
- Yeah.

892
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:18.992
Well, I'm already here, so...

893
00:53:19.576 --> 00:53:23.413
- How convenient.
- Yeah.

894
00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:30.127
- Hello?
- <i>Augie? We're on track tonight.</i>

895
00:53:30.128 --> 00:53:32.213
Aria bar, 6:00 p.m. Do
you have everything?

896
00:53:32.214 --> 00:53:34.965
Some of my finest
work. If I may say so.

897
00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:37.727
What, better than that passport that
got me cavity searched in Bogotá?

898
00:53:39.512 --> 00:53:41.680
You're never gonna let
me forget that, are you?

899
00:53:41.681 --> 00:53:44.183
Yeah, sure. The day I forget
the snap of that latex glove.

900
00:53:44.184 --> 00:53:45.559
<i>Have you told them yet?</i>

901
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.644
I'm working on it, all right?

902
00:53:46.645 --> 00:53:48.855
It's not exactly easy to
work into a conversation.

903
00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.522
You know, they might
think that something is up

904
00:53:50.523 --> 00:53:52.775
when they have to change their
name and leave the country.

905
00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:54.318
What are you waiting for?

906
00:53:54.319 --> 00:53:57.197
I said I'm working on it, Augie.
All right? Give me a break.

907
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:09.668
Look, Jess.

908
00:54:11.253 --> 00:54:13.046
There's something that
I need to tell you.

909
00:54:14.381 --> 00:54:15.882
About the other Dan.

910
00:54:17.008 --> 00:54:18.884
The Dan I was before we met.

911
00:54:18.885 --> 00:54:21.388
Dad? Who you talking to?

912
00:54:22.138 --> 00:54:23.223
Nobody. Sit down.

913
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:26.601
Girls aren't ready yet.

914
00:54:28.853 --> 00:54:30.230
So, Kyllboi, huh?

915
00:54:31.022 --> 00:54:32.315
Why didn't you tell us?

916
00:54:33.149 --> 00:54:35.109
I knew you'd never get it,

917
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.570
that you'd just freak out
and ban me for even longer.

918
00:54:37.571 --> 00:54:39.655
- Here you go.
- I wasn't trying to punish you, you know.

919
00:54:39.656 --> 00:54:41.282
We just wanted you to
have other interests.

920
00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:43.534
Make some friends. Be a
little bit more normal.

921
00:54:43.535 --> 00:54:47.080
I have friends. Okay?
Thousands of them.

922
00:54:47.747 --> 00:54:49.790
People like me when
I'm Kyllboi, okay?

923
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:51.208
I like me.

924
00:54:51.209 --> 00:54:54.295
But when I'm Kyle, I'm
too shy to talk to girls.

925
00:54:54.296 --> 00:54:57.424
You know, I'm not good enough
to make the baseball team.

926
00:54:57.924 --> 00:54:59.175
I'm a nobody.

927
00:54:59.926 --> 00:55:02.428
But when I'm Kyllboi,
I'm good, Dad.

928
00:55:02.429 --> 00:55:04.264
Like pro-level good.

929
00:55:05.807 --> 00:55:07.391
Look, okay.

930
00:55:07.392 --> 00:55:09.226
I know you think it's
all just a waste of time,

931
00:55:09.227 --> 00:55:11.605
but it takes brains
and reflexes.

932
00:55:12.147 --> 00:55:13.564
The Air Force recruits gamers.

933
00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:15.734
Yeah. Maybe that's
what I'm afraid of.

934
00:55:21.698 --> 00:55:23.949
- Let me show you.
- Show me what?

935
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:26.827
- What I can do.
- Laser tag?

936
00:55:26.828 --> 00:55:28.287
You can't be serious.

937
00:55:28.288 --> 00:55:32.333
Single combat, okay? If I win,
I get to start gaming again.

938
00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:33.709
If you win, the ban remains.

939
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:35.461
What, I don't get anything?

940
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.339
Okay, fine. What do you want?

941
00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:39.882
A catch. Like we used to.

942
00:55:39.883 --> 00:55:42.593
You and me in the backyard, throwing
a ball every day for six months.

943
00:55:42.594 --> 00:55:44.470
Dad, I'm not 12.

944
00:55:44.471 --> 00:55:46.972
Well, you're gonna smoke me anyway.
Right, Mr. Brains and Reflexes?

945
00:55:46.973 --> 00:55:48.307
Fine. Good luck.

946
00:55:48.308 --> 00:55:49.351
You are so screwed.

947
00:55:51.561 --> 00:55:52.561
Let's go.

948
00:55:52.562 --> 00:55:54.939
You're green. You're blue.

949
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.649
Once you're hit, you're
out for five seconds.

950
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.776
First one to three kills, wins.

951
00:55:58.777 --> 00:56:00.195
You just pull the trigger?

952
00:56:02.072 --> 00:56:03.530
<i>Death match.</i>

953
00:56:03.531 --> 00:56:05.032
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

954
00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:08.702
<i>Three, two, one, fight.</i>

955
00:56:08.703 --> 00:56:10.163
Go easy on me, buddy.

956
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.876
Dad. Come on. I'll give
you a free one, yeah?

957
00:56:15.877 --> 00:56:16.877
All right.

958
00:56:24.522 --> 00:56:26.607
<i>- First blood.
- </i> I got lucky there.

959
00:56:27.545 --> 00:56:28.765
All right. That's one.

960
00:56:35.981 --> 00:56:37.023
How are you doing this?

961
00:56:37.524 --> 00:56:38.942
No. No, don't...

962
00:56:42.779 --> 00:56:46.241
Hey, Kyllboi. I thought you wanted
to play laser tag, not hide-and-seek.

963
00:56:54.291 --> 00:56:58.336
You sneaky little shit. You're
getting pretty good at this, Kyle.

964
00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.660
Well, at least I
don't need a DNA test.

965
00:57:03.685 --> 00:57:05.010
<i>Sudden death.</i>

966
00:57:16.695 --> 00:57:18.030
<i>Game over.</i>

967
00:57:20.442 --> 00:57:22.861
Kyle, come on. Don't be mad.

968
00:57:23.653 --> 00:57:24.862
You conned me.

969
00:57:24.863 --> 00:57:27.031
You're a laser tag savant.

970
00:57:27.032 --> 00:57:28.449
No. I was a kid in the '80s.

971
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.285
Yeah, like there were
lasers back then.

972
00:57:31.244 --> 00:57:33.954
Come on, pal. You
were good in there.

973
00:57:33.955 --> 00:57:35.789
You adapted quickly.
You got creative.

974
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:37.125
You almost had me.

975
00:57:38.335 --> 00:57:40.879
And I gotta admit, I really
enjoyed doing that with you.

976
00:57:41.463 --> 00:57:42.881
I mean, it meant a lot to me.

977
00:57:44.507 --> 00:57:45.634
Are we good?

978
00:57:46.509 --> 00:57:48.053
Come on. Give me some love.

979
00:57:48.845 --> 00:57:50.597
Real love. Yeah.

980
00:57:52.224 --> 00:57:55.393
- Not bad for an old man, huh?
- Yeah. For sure.

981
00:57:56.561 --> 00:57:59.564
Hey. What do you say, <i>mamacita</i>?

982
00:58:00.398 --> 00:58:01.815

983

- Vegas!
- Are you ready?

984
00:58:03.068 --> 00:58:04.694
Maxie.

985
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.081
- I love you.
- I love you.

986
00:58:26.299 --> 00:58:28.510

How about that?

998
00:59:29.863 --> 00:59:30.988
Wow!

999
00:59:30.989 --> 00:59:32.489
This is so cool.

1000
00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:35.201
- Dan, the floors are so shiny.
- Look at this place!

1001
00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.872
This is all ours?

Oh, my God.

00:59:42.334 --> 00:59:43.334
Oh, wow.

1004
00:59:43.335 --> 00:59:46.378
"Enjoy the suite for which every
possible promotion has been applied.

reservation at La Maison D'Or.

Thank you for being exceptional

1007
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:54.970
What?

1008
00:59:54.971 --> 00:59:56.931
- Nina?
- Yep.

1009
00:59:56.932 --> 00:59:58.599
You have to look at this tub.

1010
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.440
I gotta run downstairs for a sec.
Don't let them raid the minibar, okay?

1011
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.479
That is not mini.

1012
01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.856
Oh, my God.

1013
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:07.734
Oh, my God. Yes!

1014
01:00:13.406 --> 01:00:14.407
Hey.

1015
01:00:16.034 --> 01:00:18.077
Look at you, playing
the family man.

1016
01:00:18.078 --> 01:00:19.704
I'm not playing.
This is my life.

1017
01:00:20.872 --> 01:00:22.552
You see any sign of
trouble on your way in?

1018
01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:24.625
- Uh-uh.
- Me neither.

1019
01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:27.253
I mean, I messed up, stopping in
Iowa, but I think we're in the clear.

1020
01:00:27.254 --> 01:00:30.089
Well, then enjoy your last
night as Dan Morgan, my friend.

1021
01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:34.093
I've got you on a flight to Vancouver in
the morning under your new identities.

1022
01:00:34.094 --> 01:00:36.638
Hey. You're a lifesaver,
Augs. Thank you.

1023
01:00:37.305 --> 01:00:39.056
Try to get out of Vegas
with some of it, huh?

1024
01:00:39.057 --> 01:00:41.184
I promise nothing.

1025
01:00:42.143 --> 01:00:43.645
How did the family
take the news?

1026
01:00:44.396 --> 01:00:46.982
I haven't told them yet.
I'm telling Jess at dinner.

1027
01:00:47.774 --> 01:00:50.442
- I suggest a Japanese restaurant.
- Why?

1028
01:00:50.443 --> 01:00:52.195
No knives.

1029
01:01:14.384 --> 01:01:16.802
Wow. You look incredible.

1030
01:01:16.803 --> 01:01:17.887
I know.

1031
01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:19.973
Wow! What a lucky guy I am.

1032
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:22.350
Wow!

1033
01:01:24.144 --> 01:01:25.186
Come on.

1034
01:01:29.065 --> 01:01:31.859
Hey. All right.
You two are on Max.

1035
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:34.111
You're not to leave this
suite under any circumstance.

1036
01:01:34.112 --> 01:01:36.864
There's food in the supersized minibar.
You do not open that door for anyone.

1037
01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:38.157
- You got it?
- Got it.

1038
01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:39.283
What about you, Maxie?

1039
01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:42.954
- You got it?
- Yeah? All right. Have fun. Be good.

1040
01:01:49.836 --> 01:01:51.629
- Screw that, right?
- Oh, yeah.

1041
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:52.923
Ready?

1042
01:01:53.465 --> 01:01:54.549
Let's go.

1043
01:01:56.301 --> 01:01:57.594
Yeah.

1044
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:02.724
Excited.

1045
01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:18.614
Wow.

1046
01:02:18.615 --> 01:02:21.116
Hey, let's go to HyperX. I
wanna see the esports arena.

1047
01:02:21.117 --> 01:02:25.037
No way. No, I'm not spending my time in
an arena full of Kyles. I'm not going.

1048
01:02:25.038 --> 01:02:27.165
Sucks to suck. Me
and Max are going.

1049
01:02:30.502 --> 01:02:32.337
- Hello, Elvis.
- Uh-huh.

1050
01:02:44.516 --> 01:02:45.559
- Bye.
- Bye.

1051
01:03:11.418 --> 01:03:13.711
All right. I think it's just
down here. You're gonna love it.

1052
01:03:13.712 --> 01:03:15.130
I already hate it.

1053
01:03:15.755 --> 01:03:21.344
<i>Welcome to the HyperX Arena. Five
minutes until our final round.</i>

1054
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.055
This is sick.

1055
01:03:25.056 --> 01:03:26.849
Smells like your
room on steroids.

1056
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.934
Thanks.

1057
01:03:28.435 --> 01:03:29.560
That's Ren.

1058
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:31.937
Hi. Sorry. Big fan.

1059
01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.815
Thanks. Wait. You're...

1060
01:03:34.441 --> 01:03:37.235
- Kyllboi.
- Yeah. I've seen your streams.

1061
01:03:37.819 --> 01:03:38.945
Thanks.

1062
01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:41.990
Hey.

1063
01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:44.367
Do you wanna meet
Valkyrae and the others?

1064
01:03:45.035 --> 01:03:46.368
Hell yeah.

1065
01:03:46.369 --> 01:03:48.287
Okay. I have a gift for you.

1066
01:03:48.288 --> 01:03:50.415
- Okay.
- Take him.

1067
01:03:54.461 --> 01:03:55.921
Thank you very much.

1068
01:03:58.215 --> 01:03:59.424
- To us.
- Yeah.

1069
01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:02.593
I can't believe we
actually did it.

1070
01:04:02.594 --> 01:04:03.928
- We're here.
- Yep.

1071
01:04:03.929 --> 01:04:05.512
We're here.

1072
01:04:05.513 --> 01:04:06.722
Look, Jess,

1073
01:04:06.723 --> 01:04:08.682
- There's something I need to tell you.
- Hang on.

1074
01:04:08.683 --> 01:04:10.018
- Come here.
- What?

1075
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:11.811
Oh, my God.

1076
01:04:13.104 --> 01:04:15.482
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1077
01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:18.878
Sorry. I interrupted.

1078
01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:22.567
No, it's okay. It's just... The
reason that we came on this trip...

1079
01:04:27.452 --> 01:04:28.535
What I was saying was...

1080
01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.120
Would you like some pepper?

1081
01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:32.017
I don't want pepper.

1082
01:04:32.246 --> 01:04:34.164
I want to be alone with my wife.

1083
01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:36.246
I don't actually speak French.

1084
01:04:36.271 --> 01:04:38.065
They just teach us
enough to sound fancy.

1085
01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:41.383
I'll give you a minute.

1086
01:04:43.576 --> 01:04:45.218
You speak French too?

1087
01:04:46.692 --> 01:04:48.735
I took some French
back in the day.

1088
01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.261
It's literally kind of weird
that you've never mentioned to me

1089
01:04:51.286 --> 01:04:53.664
that you speak two
foreign languages.

1090
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.006
How good are you?

1091
01:05:00.239 --> 01:05:02.450
I don't know, it
has been a while.

1092
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.543
I have traveled
around the world.

1093
01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:08.869
Despite that, it's hard
to tell you the truth.

1094
01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:12.497
I'm afraid to break your heart.

1095
01:05:12.922 --> 01:05:16.383
I don't know if you
will still love me...

1096
01:05:16.431 --> 01:05:19.684
once you know who I truly am.

1097
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.838
I'm sorry that you're
being pulled into this...

1098
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:25.342
but I swear on my life...

1099
01:05:25.343 --> 01:05:27.386
that I'll never
let any person...

1100
01:05:27.387 --> 01:05:32.017
hurt you or the kids.

1101
01:05:34.415 --> 01:05:36.354
That was crazy sexy.

1102
01:05:37.074 --> 01:05:39.409
Why does everything sound
so much better in French?

1103
01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:40.976
Well, it's an innately
melodic language.

1104
01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:42.960
At some point, you and
I are gonna have to talk

1105
01:05:42.985 --> 01:05:44.861
about why you never
told me you can do that.

1106
01:05:44.886 --> 01:05:47.596
I mean, it's crazy
you didn't tell me.

1107
01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:51.040
We should also talk about
how insane you've been acting

1108
01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.900
ever since you showed up
and whisked us off to Vegas.

1109
01:05:52.925 --> 01:05:55.677
But right now, I just
wanna be here with you.

1110
01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.911
I wanna be eating
this amazing food,

1111
01:05:57.936 --> 01:06:00.022
and drinking this
champagne we can't afford,

1112
01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:03.376
and enjoying each other's
company, and just maybe...

1113
01:06:05.448 --> 01:06:11.162
showing that ridiculous hotel suite
some moves it has never seen before.

1114
01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.889
I don't know about you, but that
sounds like a pretty perfect night.

1115
01:06:18.396 --> 01:06:21.523
- What rank are you?
- Ascendant 3.

1116
01:06:21.524 --> 01:06:24.110
Damn. Really? That's
better than him.

1117
01:06:24.986 --> 01:06:26.111
That's incredible.

1118
01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:28.155
- Oh, my.
- How long you been playing for?

1119
01:06:28.156 --> 01:06:30.032
I mean, since the game came out.

1120
01:06:30.033 --> 01:06:31.785
It's cool your
brother's Kyllboi.

1121
01:06:32.452 --> 01:06:34.663
- Is it?
- Yeah. He's the real deal.

1122
01:06:37.958 --> 01:06:39.917
So, is this your...

1123
01:06:39.918 --> 01:06:42.962
No. Oh, God. No.

1124
01:06:42.963 --> 01:06:45.631
- I found him. Just over there.
- Over there?

1125
01:06:45.632 --> 01:06:48.384
- Yeah.
- Just hanging out?

1126
01:06:48.385 --> 01:06:50.761
It's time for the finals.

1127
01:06:50.762 --> 01:06:56.142
Team Valkyrae and Team
iiTzTimmy onto the stage!

1128
01:07:00.146 --> 01:07:02.065
Hey, let's go.

1129
01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:07.320
Use Kyllboi.

1130
01:07:09.489 --> 01:07:10.823
Are you up for it?

1131
01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:12.199
The finals?

1132
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.520
Yeah, this is one of those
moments, man. Are you in or out?

1133
01:07:17.747 --> 01:07:20.165
- In.
- Let's go. Yeah.

1134
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.375
- Okay.
- Don't be nervous.

1135
01:07:21.376 --> 01:07:23.586
- It'll be a piece of cake.
- Thanks.

1136
01:07:23.587 --> 01:07:25.171
Hey, that was kind
of cool of you.

1137
01:07:26.381 --> 01:07:28.425
Not really. They're
gonna get destroyed.

1138
01:07:29.551 --> 01:07:31.761
What's up, everyone?

1139
01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:34.598
Take a seat, Kyllboi,
right next to me.

1140
01:07:56.328 --> 01:07:57.494
Do you have ammo?

1141
01:07:57.495 --> 01:07:59.372
I'm gonna try and block
us off real quick.

1142
01:08:03.168 --> 01:08:04.169
Above here.

1143
01:08:06.504 --> 01:08:07.504
Let's go.

1144
01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:10.841
- Good job.
- Okay. Next.

1145
01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:12.385
No more bets.

1146
01:08:12.886 --> 01:08:16.931
- Oh, shoot!
- I'm gonna call the kids.

1147
01:08:16.932 --> 01:08:18.098
Okay. Yeah.

1148
01:08:21.268 --> 01:08:22.645
Check B Main right now.

1149
01:08:22.646 --> 01:08:24.646
- Nice shot.
- Here's the last one.

1150
01:08:24.647 --> 01:08:26.149
He satcheled in.

1151
01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.652
- Are you serious? What was that?
- Nice!

1152
01:08:30.445 --> 01:08:32.530
That was so sick!

1153
01:08:42.958 --> 01:08:43.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

1154
01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:46.545
Hey, the kids aren't answering.
You wanna head back up?

1155
01:08:47.128 --> 01:08:48.838
Yeah. Let's do it. Okay.

1156
01:08:57.222 --> 01:08:59.307
Jess. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1157
01:09:05.188 --> 01:09:06.271
They okay?

1158
01:09:06.272 --> 01:09:07.774
They're good.

1159
01:09:10.485 --> 01:09:12.528
Look, I'm so sorry we cut
the night short. I didn't...

1160
01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:13.822
Who says we did?

1161
01:09:15.615 --> 01:09:19.285
Give me 30 seconds to freshen
up, and then meet me in bed.

1162
01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:20.370
Okay.

1163
01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:50.232
Okay.

1164
01:09:52.235 --> 01:09:53.236
Mood.

1165
01:10:04.831 --> 01:10:06.041
Love mist.

1166
01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:10.962
Jess!

1167
01:10:24.226 --> 01:10:25.226
Dan?

1168
01:10:50.335 --> 01:10:51.753
- Oh, my God.
- There he is.

1169
01:10:52.295 --> 01:10:53.421
Dan?

1170
01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:55.616
- I've been looking for you.
- Dan.

1171
01:10:59.886 --> 01:11:00.887
Dan.

1172
01:11:02.973 --> 01:11:04.349
Easy, Coogan.

1173
01:11:05.308 --> 01:11:07.435
You got me. You win.

1174
01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.402
Just let her go.

1175
01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:18.905
- She doesn't know anything.
- Well, I'd say she does now, Sean.

1176
01:11:19.906 --> 01:11:22.784
Yeah. So here's how
this is gonna go.

1177
01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:24.661
First, I'm gonna kill you.

1178
01:11:25.579 --> 01:11:26.699
And then I'm gonna kill her.

1179
01:11:27.872 --> 01:11:30.834
And then I'm gonna have my
associate at HyperX kill your kids.

1180
01:11:32.794 --> 01:11:33.795
How's that sound?

1181
01:11:39.259 --> 01:11:40.468
I can explain.

1182
01:11:48.268 --> 01:11:50.478
That's normal, honey. Everybody
barfs their first time.

1183
01:11:52.564 --> 01:11:53.857
Give me one second.

1184
01:12:01.698 --> 01:12:02.741
What?

1185
01:12:03.408 --> 01:12:05.035
Oh, my God.

1186
01:12:07.287 --> 01:12:08.580
Jess, wait. Where are you going?

1187
01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.248
HyperX.

1188
01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:21.967
So, do you want me to talk,
or do you have things to say?

1189
01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:24.094
- Do I have things to say?
- Right. Sorry.

1190
01:12:24.095 --> 01:12:26.556
I have eyeball on me, Sean.

1191
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.350
Fucking eyeball.

1192
01:12:30.352 --> 01:12:32.561
- Jess.
- Shut up. Shut up!

1193
01:12:32.562 --> 01:12:35.064
I don't wanna hear it. I
don't even wanna look at you.

1194
01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:36.398
I just wanna find my kids,

1195
01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:39.653
who don't have their goddamn
phones because you threw them away!

1196
01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:44.950
Kyllboi, it's just you and me.

1197
01:12:46.701 --> 01:12:49.037
Take this guy. Breach.

1198
01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:53.208
Watch out!

1199
01:12:54.834 --> 01:12:56.670
- I have a rez.
- Okay.

1200
01:13:00.131 --> 01:13:01.383
Oh, no.

1201
01:13:03.051 --> 01:13:04.719
- Shit on!
- Oh, my God.

1202
01:13:05.387 --> 01:13:06.887
It's all on you, man.

1203
01:13:06.888 --> 01:13:08.473
To the left. Nice shot.

1204
01:13:10.642 --> 01:13:12.519
- Nice. One more.
- Coming.

1205
01:13:17.983 --> 01:13:19.484
- Let's go!
- Yes! Yes!

1206
01:13:20.277 --> 01:13:22.195
We have a winner!

1207
01:13:23.572 --> 01:13:25.865
- Team Valkyrae wins!
- Yes!

1208
01:13:27.826 --> 01:13:29.618
Doesn't get much
closer than that.

1209
01:13:29.619 --> 01:13:32.538
Kyllboi! Kyllboi! That's right.

1210
01:13:32.539 --> 01:13:35.792
- Kyllboi!
- Give it up!

1211
01:13:40.672 --> 01:13:42.757
- It's Kyllboi.
- Who's Kyllboi?

1212
01:13:43.258 --> 01:13:44.425
Kyllboi!

1213
01:13:44.426 --> 01:13:45.509
Kyle?

1214
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:47.345
Oh, shit. Kyle!

1215
01:13:48.972 --> 01:13:50.514
- Hey!
- Where's your brother?

1216
01:13:50.515 --> 01:13:52.558
That's a funny story. He's
literally right there.

1217
01:13:52.559 --> 01:13:54.184
- No. Your other brother.
- Okay, yeah. He's fine.

1218
01:13:54.185 --> 01:13:55.269
He's good. He's with Ren.

1219
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.729
- What?
- Excuse me.

1220
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.355
See?

1221
01:13:58.356 --> 01:14:01.735
- He's fine. Max is great. Heya.
- Hey.

1222
01:14:02.819 --> 01:14:03.944
- Okay. Call me.
- Listen.

1223
01:14:03.945 --> 01:14:06.030
I know you guys are mad...

1224
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:07.948
Listen, that's me
they're cheering for.

1225
01:14:07.949 --> 01:14:10.409
- What were you thinking?
- Well, Max is fine.

1226
01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.369
Okay, look. Guys, we don't
have time for this, okay?

1227
01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.704
We need to get out of this city.

1228
01:14:13.705 --> 01:14:14.955
Overreact much?

1229
01:14:14.956 --> 01:14:17.082
Wait. Why do we have to leave?

1230
01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.751
Because.

1231
01:14:18.752 --> 01:14:20.837
- Jess, tell them, please.
- This is all on you.

1232
01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:24.840
We have to leave because my former
coworkers are trying to kill us.

1233
01:14:24.841 --> 01:14:26.467
What? From Planet Car Deals?

1234
01:14:26.468 --> 01:14:28.303
I'm not kidding around. Ask Max.

1235
01:14:28.887 --> 01:14:30.846
Before I met your mom,
I was a covert assassin.

1236
01:14:30.847 --> 01:14:32.647
I escaped that life, and
now they've found us.

1237
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:38.313
Dad, you are, like, the
biggest wimp on the planet.

1238
01:14:39.648 --> 01:14:42.317
Thank you. Move. Go! Now!

1239
01:14:43.318 --> 01:14:44.861
Go, go.

1240
01:14:46.238 --> 01:14:47.822
Find an exit.

1241
01:14:49.616 --> 01:14:54.246
- Move, guys. Come on.
- Go. Go.

1242
01:15:00.126 --> 01:15:01.335
- Dad?
- What the fuck?

1243
01:15:01.336 --> 01:15:03.003
I'm gonna draw her fire, okay?

1244
01:15:03.004 --> 01:15:06.675
When I do, take the kids that way.
I'll be right behind you, okay?

1245
01:15:39.082 --> 01:15:40.166
Go.

1246
01:15:43.461 --> 01:15:45.045
Jess, she's coming. Wait here.

1247
01:15:45.046 --> 01:15:47.007
- Okay.
- Wait right here.

1248
01:15:58.518 --> 01:15:59.768
It's okay, honey.

1249
01:15:59.769 --> 01:16:01.771
Everyone barfs the first time.

1250
01:16:06.026 --> 01:16:08.111
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on. Let's go.

1251
01:16:11.114 --> 01:16:12.157
Move, guys. Go.

1252
01:16:31.968 --> 01:16:33.553
My real name is Sean.

1253
01:16:34.471 --> 01:16:35.931
My mother died when I was four.

1254
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:37.598
My father was prone to violence.

1255
01:16:37.599 --> 01:16:39.851
When I turned 18, it was
straight into the army.

1256
01:16:40.352 --> 01:16:43.062
I dunno. Maybe it was his genes
coming out, but I thrived.

1257
01:16:43.063 --> 01:16:44.813
I was a Green Beret.
I was a Delta.

1258
01:16:44.814 --> 01:16:47.483
And then I was approached
by a man named McCaffrey.

1259
01:16:47.484 --> 01:16:48.944
Former SAS.

1260
01:16:49.527 --> 01:16:52.446
He took my training to a whole other level
and recruited me into a special program.

1261
01:16:52.447 --> 01:16:55.908
- It was a chance to do some real good.
- What kind of special program?

1262
01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:57.701
We took out the
worst of the worst.

1263
01:16:57.702 --> 01:17:00.329
Terrorists, warlords,
kidnappers all over the world.

1264
01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.081
Ones the government
couldn't legally touch.

1265
01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:03.667
Took out, as in...

1266
01:17:05.335 --> 01:17:06.835
- Well, how many?
- Twenty-six.

1267
01:17:06.836 --> 01:17:09.505
- You've killed 26 pe...
- No.

1268
01:17:09.506 --> 01:17:11.799
No, I went on 26 operations.

1269
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.051
Oh, God.

1270
01:17:13.718 --> 01:17:15.887
- Thirty-nine people.
- That's more!

1271
01:17:17.556 --> 01:17:19.974
- Are we including this trip?
- Total dead people, Dan!

1272
01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:21.309
- Dad.
- Forty-three.

1273
01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:23.227
They were all bad.

1274
01:17:23.228 --> 01:17:26.981
- You are such a hypocrite.
- All bad people.

1275
01:17:26.982 --> 01:17:31.569
You took away the one thing I'm good
at because there's fake violence,

1276
01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:32.695
and you're a serial killer?

1277
01:17:32.696 --> 01:17:35.364
Dad, you were working
for the good guys, right?

1278
01:17:35.365 --> 01:17:37.116
McCaffrey was a father figure.

1279
01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:38.951
I trusted him, but I was naive.

1280
01:17:38.952 --> 01:17:40.787
I mean, it started out legit.

1281
01:17:41.746 --> 01:17:44.039
But he got greedy and began
farming us out as mercenaries

1282
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.249
to the highest bidder.

1283
01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:47.751
And as soon as I found
out, I left. All right?

1284
01:17:47.752 --> 01:17:50.796
I fought my way out, but that
meant turning against my friends,

1285
01:17:50.797 --> 01:17:53.966
my mentor, against the only
real family that I'd ever known.

1286
01:17:53.967 --> 01:17:55.594
So they've been
hunting you ever since.

1287
01:17:56.553 --> 01:17:59.180
- Yeah.
- I am such an idiot.

1288
01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:03.309
This is why you're so secretive,
why you never wanna go anywhere.

1289
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:06.396
Why you're so weird
about social media.

1290
01:18:06.897 --> 01:18:08.606
Why you're so anti-technology.

1291
01:18:08.607 --> 01:18:11.859
Well, with facial recognition
software, I had no choice.

1292
01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:15.029
Plus, I really do think that social media
is fundamentally disgusting and gross.

1293
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.781
- God.
- But now that they found us, what happens?

1294
01:18:17.782 --> 01:18:18.992
I got it figured out.

1295
01:18:20.035 --> 01:18:21.286
We're good.

1296
01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:24.331
That's yours.

1297
01:18:24.915 --> 01:18:27.250
And that's yours.
And that's yours.

1298
01:18:29.252 --> 01:18:30.294
"Molly Anderson"?

1299
01:18:30.295 --> 01:18:32.004
At least you got a real name.

1300
01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.505
I'm Van.

1301
01:18:33.506 --> 01:18:34.965
I'm a vehicle.

1302
01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:36.258
Van?

1303
01:18:36.259 --> 01:18:38.469
Look, we can't go back
to Buffalo, all right?

1304
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:40.137
Those lives are over. I'm sorry.

1305
01:18:40.138 --> 01:18:44.351
I finally have a life,
and you're ruining it.

1306
01:18:47.646 --> 01:18:49.230
- Thanks, Dad.
- Kyle, come back.

1307
01:18:49.231 --> 01:18:52.816
Dad, no. You don't get to
tell us what to do anymore.

1308
01:18:52.817 --> 01:18:54.986
- Ever.
- Come...

1309
01:18:57.614 --> 01:18:59.949
- Eighteen years of lies.
- I'm still the man you married.

1310
01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:02.618
- I was just something different before.
- Something different?

1311
01:19:02.619 --> 01:19:04.995
You weren't in a
band or vegan, Dan.

1312
01:19:04.996 --> 01:19:06.956
That would be
something different.

1313
01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:09.375
You were an assassin for hire.

1314
01:19:09.376 --> 01:19:11.085
I kept the truth from
you to protect you, okay?

1315
01:19:11.086 --> 01:19:14.214
- But our love was real.
- Real? Are you serious?

1316
01:19:14.839 --> 01:19:16.799
What, was it so real that
you couldn't trust me

1317
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.802
with knowing how much
danger we were in?

1318
01:19:19.678 --> 01:19:20.804
What did you think?

1319
01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:25.224
That I'd go blabbing about it
on the moms' school text chain?

1320
01:19:25.225 --> 01:19:26.976
- No. I...
- Or were you afraid I'd leave you,

1321
01:19:26.977 --> 01:19:28.435
knowing who you really are?

1322
01:19:28.436 --> 01:19:30.479
We were just some
disguise for you,

1323
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.107
just some part of your
cover as a suburban schlub?

1324
01:19:33.108 --> 01:19:36.235
- What? No.
- Fuck, you must have resented us. Right?

1325
01:19:36.236 --> 01:19:40.322
Every single day, eking out a living,
wiping kids' asses, driving a minivan.

1326
01:19:40.323 --> 01:19:42.283
I love that minivan.

1327
01:19:42.284 --> 01:19:46.870
I mean, all of a sudden you're, like,
what, James Bond, and now you're what?

1328
01:19:46.871 --> 01:19:48.123
Normal.

1329
01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:52.501
A normal guy with a normal,
wonderful, perfect life.

1330
01:19:52.502 --> 01:19:54.211
That's all I've ever wanted.

1331
01:19:54.212 --> 01:19:56.088
I mean, you were a decathlete.

1332
01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:57.464
You should've medaled in Athens.

1333
01:19:57.465 --> 01:19:59.008
Do you resent your
life as a mom?

1334
01:19:59.009 --> 01:20:00.093
Sometimes.

1335
01:20:01.094 --> 01:20:02.178
Yes.

1336
01:20:02.888 --> 01:20:04.014
I don't wanna be that guy.

1337
01:20:05.682 --> 01:20:07.183
I wish I could believe you.

1338
01:20:08.476 --> 01:20:09.603
I really do.

1339
01:20:10.186 --> 01:20:11.687
But to be honest,

1340
01:20:11.688 --> 01:20:14.941
this trip is the happiest
that I have seen you in years.

1341
01:20:16.484 --> 01:20:20.779
A trip in which you
have killed four people.

1342
01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:22.991
I mean, is this really you?

1343
01:20:26.369 --> 01:20:29.456
You're a stranger named Sean.

1344
01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:35.462
"Archibald Anderson."

1345
01:20:36.046 --> 01:20:37.923
Oh, damn it, Augie.

1346
01:20:39.049 --> 01:20:43.136
You know, first thing in the morning,
I am taking the kids and I am leaving.

1347
01:20:43.762 --> 01:20:46.014
- Jess, it's not safe.
- It's not safe with you.

1348
01:20:46.806 --> 01:20:48.098
They're after you, not us.

1349
01:20:48.099 --> 01:20:51.061
And from now on, I'm making the
decisions about me and the kids.

1350
01:20:53.647 --> 01:20:54.814
Jess.

1351
01:21:04.866 --> 01:21:07.076
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for picking up.

1352
01:21:07.077 --> 01:21:08.161
I know it's late.

1353
01:21:08.662 --> 01:21:12.666
I was wondering if you could help with
some travel for my family, please.

1354
01:21:40.443 --> 01:21:42.695
- Where are you going?
- Far from here, far from you.

1355
01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:44.530
- Where?
- It's none of your business.

1356
01:21:44.531 --> 01:21:45.739
What? Like hell it isn't.

1357
01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:48.033
Hey, you cannot go to the airport, you
know. They're gonna be waiting there.

1358
01:21:48.034 --> 01:21:50.327
Well, we're not. We've
made other arrangements.

1359
01:21:50.328 --> 01:21:51.412
What other arrangements?

1360
01:21:51.413 --> 01:21:54.123
Sorry, Dan. Can't say.
It's to protect you.

1361
01:21:54.124 --> 01:21:56.126
Jess... Oh, really?
Come on. Don't...

1362
01:21:58.461 --> 01:22:00.629
Jess. Please. It's not safe.

1363
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.965
Then handle it. Make it safe.

1364
01:22:02.966 --> 01:22:04.968
And when you're done with
it, stay away from us.

1365
01:22:23.028 --> 01:22:24.070
Is this for us?

1366
01:22:24.821 --> 01:22:27.032
No, I don't think
so. Couldn't be.

1367
01:22:34.748 --> 01:22:36.666
- Hi.
- Gwen.

1368
01:22:37.542 --> 01:22:40.002
What are you doing here? I
wasn't expecting all this.

1369
01:22:40.003 --> 01:22:43.089
I was on a layover nearby, and I
thought, I'll just come get you myself.

1370
01:22:43.882 --> 01:22:45.090
Okay.

1371
01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:47.928
Hi. You must be Molly and Van.

1372
01:22:48.511 --> 01:22:52.640
I'm Gwen. Hi, little one. There's
breakfast on board, if you'd like it.

1373
01:22:52.641 --> 01:22:53.808
Sure.

1374
01:22:55.769 --> 01:22:58.396
- Thanks.
- Jessica, what is wrong? Are you okay?

1375
01:22:59.022 --> 01:23:00.690
What happened?
Where's your husband?

1376
01:23:01.608 --> 01:23:02.776
We had a fight.

1377
01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:04.985
Oh, boy.

1378
01:23:04.986 --> 01:23:07.571
Hey, maybe you can help me
with my guy problems then.

1379
01:23:07.572 --> 01:23:09.241
- How about that?
- I'd love to.

1380
01:23:10.367 --> 01:23:12.493
Remember that ex I told
you about in Buffalo?

1381
01:23:12.494 --> 01:23:14.495
- Yeah.
- We were together for years.

1382
01:23:14.496 --> 01:23:16.831
It was good. I mean,
it was really good.

1383
01:23:17.832 --> 01:23:21.127
You know when you just can't get
enough of each other physically?

1384
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:25.423
I thought he was the one, and
then he just threw it all away.

1385
01:23:26.007 --> 01:23:28.801
Married some other woman who
was the complete opposite of me.

1386
01:23:28.802 --> 01:23:29.886
And the worst part...

1387
01:23:30.762 --> 01:23:31.972
she's insufferable.

1388
01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:34.598
- Wait. You met her?
- I had to.

1389
01:23:34.599 --> 01:23:36.225
He created this whole
life with this woman,

1390
01:23:36.226 --> 01:23:38.477
and I needed to see what
she had that I didn't.

1391
01:23:38.478 --> 01:23:39.645
What did you do?

1392
01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:42.648
I did what I do
best. I got in close,

1393
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:47.654
I won her trust, and then I just waited
patiently for her to walk into my trap.

1394
01:23:53.743 --> 01:23:57.621
You know, I think I left
something in the taxi.

1395
01:23:57.622 --> 01:23:58.914
Hey, Molly?

1396
01:23:58.915 --> 01:24:00.624
- Yeah?
- You wanna bring your brother?

1397
01:24:00.625 --> 01:24:02.627
Let's go. We're leaving.

1398
01:24:08.884 --> 01:24:10.926
I told you to stay off this op.

1399
01:24:10.927 --> 01:24:14.847
And yet, who brought them
to you in a big, fat bow?

1400
01:24:14.848 --> 01:24:16.307
You needed me.

1401
01:24:16.308 --> 01:24:18.143
I know Sean better
than you ever will.

1402
01:24:21.062 --> 01:24:23.062
Do whatever you want with
the family. I don't care.

1403
01:24:23.732 --> 01:24:26.818
I just want Sean. He's
my payment for delivery.

1404
01:24:37.787 --> 01:24:39.705
You couldn't let
it go, could you?

1405
01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:41.750
<i>You know me better than that.</i>

1406
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:43.918
Look, you can have me,

1407
01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:46.128
but I want your word that
you won't go after my family.

1408
01:24:46.129 --> 01:24:47.255
"Go after"?

1409
01:24:47.881 --> 01:24:50.175
You're a little
behind, buddy boy.

1410
01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:54.678
- I swear to God, if you hurt them...
- Come and get 'em.

1411
01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:56.096
Somewhere public.

1412
01:24:56.097 --> 01:24:58.807
I think you're mistaking
who holds the cards here.

1413
01:24:58.808 --> 01:25:02.562
<i>Be at the old Poseidon Casino
north of the city in 30 minutes...</i>

1414
01:25:03.563 --> 01:25:04.564
<i>alone.</i>

1415
01:25:46.231 --> 01:25:47.524
Come on out!

1416
01:25:52.904 --> 01:25:54.446
Hello, old friend.

1417
01:25:54.447 --> 01:25:56.448
He brought you in for
this, huh, Spiros?

1418
01:25:56.449 --> 01:25:58.159
He brought everybody.

1419
01:25:59.786 --> 01:26:01.162
Follow me.

1420
01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:09.796
He's alone.

1421
01:26:10.672 --> 01:26:13.174
Well, well. How sweet.

1422
01:26:13.925 --> 01:26:15.759
He could have been halfway
around the world by now,

1423
01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.265
and yet here he is, trading his life
for the family that abandoned him.

1424
01:26:22.976 --> 01:26:25.644
So, am I ever getting back that
five grand I lent you in Morocco?

1425
01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:26.729
I'll tell you what.

1426
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:30.150
If you're still alive in ten minutes,
I'll pay you back with interest.

1427
01:26:31.192 --> 01:26:34.487
Oh, shame. It's a
beautiful place.

1428
01:26:35.196 --> 01:26:37.157
They're demolishing
it in ten days.

1429
01:26:47.334 --> 01:26:49.502
All this for me? I'm flattered.

1430
01:26:50.545 --> 01:26:51.545
How's the family?

1431
01:26:52.088 --> 01:26:53.089
Which one?

1432
01:26:54.591 --> 01:26:55.717
We're coming up.

1433
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:13.234
There he is.

1434
01:27:13.235 --> 01:27:14.236
Are you okay?

1435
01:27:24.496 --> 01:27:25.996
No hug for your old man?

1436
01:27:25.997 --> 01:27:27.832
Why start now, Dad?

1437
01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:29.875
I'm sorry, what?

1438
01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:31.920
I'm your grandfather, Kyle.

1439
01:27:34.005 --> 01:27:35.966
Oh, my God. We're British.

1440
01:27:37.259 --> 01:27:38.634
He didn't tell ya?

1441
01:27:38.635 --> 01:27:41.805
No. He left that part out
of his no-more-lies speech.

1442
01:27:42.389 --> 01:27:45.140
- Well, I said he was a father figure.
- Not quite the same, Dan.

1443
01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:48.144
This is good, right? He's not
gonna kill his own grandkids.

1444
01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.855
Look, do whatever you
want with me. Let them go.

1445
01:27:51.856 --> 01:27:54.150
What is it you
think I want, Sean?

1446
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:55.652
Kill me.

1447
01:27:56.152 --> 01:27:59.071
In that spider's nest of a heart, you
actually think that I wronged you.

1448
01:27:59.072 --> 01:28:00.490
You were my son.

1449
01:28:02.033 --> 01:28:03.285
My legacy.

1450
01:28:04.703 --> 01:28:07.664
I poured everything I am into
you. You threw it all away.

1451
01:28:08.206 --> 01:28:10.374
You abandoned me.
You broke my heart.

1452
01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:12.210
So, yeah. I wanted you dead.

1453
01:28:13.003 --> 01:28:16.005
But then something happened
over these past few days.

1454
01:28:16.006 --> 01:28:19.092
You wasted every single guy I
sent at you. Every goddamn one.

1455
01:28:20.427 --> 01:28:23.762
You are every bit the
killer I taught you to be.

1456
01:28:23.763 --> 01:28:26.307
No. It's not who I am anymore.

1457
01:28:26.308 --> 01:28:27.392
Bullshit.

1458
01:28:29.019 --> 01:28:31.061
Tell me you didn't feel more
alive the past three days

1459
01:28:31.062 --> 01:28:33.064
than you have done in years.

1460
01:28:34.399 --> 01:28:36.943
And as you smoked
each of my men,

1461
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:41.907
I felt something that I haven't
felt in a very long time.

1462
01:28:43.283 --> 01:28:45.492
Pride in my son.

1463
01:28:45.493 --> 01:28:46.745
What? So, what is this?

1464
01:28:47.454 --> 01:28:49.622
Now you don't wanna kill me?
What the hell do you want?

1465
01:28:49.623 --> 01:28:50.956
I want you back.

1466
01:28:50.957 --> 01:28:52.124
What?

1467
01:28:52.125 --> 01:28:54.211
Things were never as
good after you left.

1468
01:28:56.504 --> 01:28:57.964
For any of us.

1469
01:28:59.007 --> 01:29:04.345
So, I want my son back, working
by my side in the family business.

1470
01:29:04.346 --> 01:29:06.889
You're not seriously
considering this,

1471
01:29:06.890 --> 01:29:08.891
- are you, Dad?
- Quiet, Kyle.

1472
01:29:08.892 --> 01:29:11.686
Everybody wins. You come
back where you belong.

1473
01:29:12.187 --> 01:29:13.688
Be who you were born to be.

1474
01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:16.565
Jess and the kids go
safely back to Buffalo.

1475
01:29:16.566 --> 01:29:18.276
It's what they want anyway.

1476
01:29:20.195 --> 01:29:22.197
Sure beats the shit
out of selling cars.

1477
01:29:23.365 --> 01:29:26.492
But no contact. Can't have
you going soft on me again.

1478
01:29:26.493 --> 01:29:28.613
I'm their father. There's
no way this is gonna happen.

1479
01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:32.123
I'm sorry to hear that.

1480
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:37.086
Start with the wife.

1481
01:29:37.087 --> 01:29:39.755
- Wait, no! I...
- There's no third option!

1482
01:29:39.756 --> 01:29:42.091
Either it all ends here and now,

1483
01:29:42.092 --> 01:29:46.680
or you give your family exactly
what they want and then some!

1484
01:29:53.562 --> 01:29:54.562
I'll do it.

1485
01:29:58.024 --> 01:29:59.025
Okay.

1486
01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:04.656
Spiros, see the family to the
airport with our blessing.

1487
01:30:25.135 --> 01:30:26.636
Dad.

1488
01:30:29.139 --> 01:30:30.347
Dad, please.

1489
01:30:30.348 --> 01:30:32.350
I love you. I'll
always love you.

1490
01:30:36.646 --> 01:30:38.647
Look, we can't just abandon Dad.

1491
01:30:38.648 --> 01:30:40.399
What am I supposed to do?

1492
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:42.943
It's my job to keep you safe.

1493
01:30:42.944 --> 01:30:44.028
I'm a mom.

1494
01:30:44.029 --> 01:30:46.113
Okay, then be the mom
that lifts the car.

1495
01:30:46.114 --> 01:30:47.656
- What?
- You know, the mom.

1496
01:30:47.657 --> 01:30:49.408
She has the baby, and
she lifts the car.

1497
01:30:49.409 --> 01:30:50.744
Yeah. You know. Car mom.

1498
01:30:51.244 --> 01:30:53.496
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

1499
01:30:54.372 --> 01:30:56.333
It's an urban
legend, Mrs. Morgan.

1500
01:30:57.626 --> 01:31:00.252
A baby is trapped under a car.

1501
01:31:00.253 --> 01:31:05.425
His mother gets a burst of adrenaline
and lifts the car up with her bare hands.

1502
01:31:07.469 --> 01:31:10.471
Your children are suggesting you
overpower me to rescue their father.

1503
01:31:10.472 --> 01:31:12.139
Yeah. Thank you. Exactly.

1504
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.432
I would advise against it.

1505
01:31:13.433 --> 01:31:15.392
Now. Duh.

1506
01:31:15.393 --> 01:31:16.978
Your father made his choice.

1507
01:31:17.854 --> 01:31:19.564
I mean, do you
think he wants this?

1508
01:31:20.148 --> 01:31:21.815
It's Dad that we're
talking about.

1509
01:31:21.816 --> 01:31:25.402
The guy that took me to junior
prom when Trevor didn't show up.

1510
01:31:25.403 --> 01:31:29.407
The guy that wakes us up for school
with shitty raps about Wednesdays.

1511
01:31:29.908 --> 01:31:32.243
That's beautiful. My
father never did that.

1512
01:31:32.244 --> 01:31:34.162
I'm sorry. Can you
shut up, Spiros?

1513
01:31:39.209 --> 01:31:40.669
Hey. Stop.

1514
01:31:45.799 --> 01:31:47.091
Children.

1515
01:31:47.092 --> 01:31:48.801
Mom, we're not a
family without Dad.

1516
01:31:48.802 --> 01:31:50.719
Dad needs to know that
we don't want this.

1517
01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:54.015
I know we said we did last
night, but, Mom, I don't.

1518
01:31:56.726 --> 01:32:00.396
If he still chooses to
do it, then so be it.

1519
01:32:00.397 --> 01:32:01.731
But he needs to know.

1520
01:32:03.108 --> 01:32:05.902
I mean, he thinks that we
don't love him anymore, Mom.

1521
01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:08.154
We can't just let
things end like that.

1522
01:32:12.576 --> 01:32:13.868
Oh, Max.

1523
01:32:14.869 --> 01:32:16.620
I haven't changed you.

1524
01:32:16.621 --> 01:32:19.748
We have to get this off of
you before you get a rash.

1525
01:32:19.749 --> 01:32:21.042
You forgot the diaper bag.

1526
01:32:23.253 --> 01:32:24.712
Oh, my gosh.

1527
01:32:24.713 --> 01:32:27.215
Ooh, gosh. It's
a real messy one.

1528
01:32:38.226 --> 01:32:39.436
Oh, crap.

1529
01:32:41.897 --> 01:32:43.273
Maybe he'll be all right.

1530
01:32:44.107 --> 01:32:45.108
Or not.

1531
01:32:45.609 --> 01:32:46.818
What do we do now?

1532
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.825
We're gonna go find your dad.

1533
01:32:56.536 --> 01:32:58.454
Give me a minute alone
with him, would you?

1534
01:32:58.455 --> 01:33:00.582
I wanna be wheels
up in ten minutes.

1535
01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.254
I thought if I ever saw
you again, I'd kill you.

1536
01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:09.841
But since we're here...

1537
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.012
Better.

1538
01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:17.307
Oh, sure. Pretend I'm not here.

1539
01:33:23.188 --> 01:33:25.522
This isn't gonna
happen. I have a wife.

1540
01:33:25.523 --> 01:33:27.567
You had a wife.

1541
01:33:28.318 --> 01:33:29.819
Now you're free.

1542
01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:36.951
Doesn't it feel good to
be back where you belong?

1543
01:33:36.952 --> 01:33:38.161
It's been a long time, Gwen.

1544
01:33:46.002 --> 01:33:47.754
You think I forgot
your little tricks?

1545
01:33:48.672 --> 01:33:50.173
You think I forgot this?

1546
01:33:53.677 --> 01:33:55.512
I knew you hadn't changed.

1547
01:33:56.388 --> 01:33:57.889
You could never resist me.

1548
01:34:02.561 --> 01:34:03.978
Vulcan neck pinch.

1549
01:34:03.979 --> 01:34:05.063
Kyusho Jitsu.

1550
01:34:06.231 --> 01:34:08.108
Hey. I'm just the tech guy.

1551
01:34:08.608 --> 01:34:09.858
I'm so sorry for this, you guys.

1552
01:34:09.859 --> 01:34:12.194
For the ass-grabbing part or
the 18-years-of-deception thing?

1553
01:34:12.195 --> 01:34:14.322
Both. All of it.

1554
01:34:15.407 --> 01:34:16.741
Hey. Tie him up.

1555
01:34:17.659 --> 01:34:19.827
- Yeah. You.
- Come on.

1556
01:34:19.828 --> 01:34:22.329
I wanted to tell you about everything,
but there was never a good time.

1557
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:24.832
- Never a good time?
- When was I gonna tell you?

1558
01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.458
On our first date? Our second?

1559
01:34:26.459 --> 01:34:28.085
When you were pregnant
with Nina or by our fourth?

1560
01:34:28.086 --> 01:34:30.212
- What?
- Do the math, Nina.

1561
01:34:30.213 --> 01:34:31.922
Any of those times would
have been a better time.

1562
01:34:31.923 --> 01:34:34.508
You should have told me the truth,
and I could have made up my own mind.

1563
01:34:34.509 --> 01:34:37.512
You're right. I'm sorry.
I was stupid and selfish.

1564
01:34:38.013 --> 01:34:39.430
But I was in love with you.

1565
01:34:39.431 --> 01:34:41.850
I mean, you've been my whole
world since the moment we met.

1566
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:44.518
Being your husband and their
father, that's the real me.

1567
01:34:44.519 --> 01:34:46.104
That's all that matters to me.

1568
01:34:47.063 --> 01:34:49.863
All right. I swear on my life, I'll
never keep anything from you again.

1569
01:34:56.865 --> 01:34:57.866
Where's Spiros?

1570
01:34:58.533 --> 01:34:59.868
Thought they were with you.

1571
01:35:07.167 --> 01:35:08.375
Hey, bro.

1572
01:35:08.376 --> 01:35:11.879
Everyone I know is talking about what
Kyllboi did at HyperX last night.

1573
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.047
- Really?
- Yeah.

1574
01:35:13.048 --> 01:35:15.217
Kyle. Less talking,
more tying, okay?

1575
01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:17.761
Sorry.

1576
01:35:19.012 --> 01:35:21.013
No way. A Sky Raven drone?

1577
01:35:21.014 --> 01:35:22.181
Awesome.

1578
01:35:22.182 --> 01:35:23.600
Just, careful with it.

1579
01:35:25.977 --> 01:35:28.854
- Hey, man. You got a great kid.
- I need your comms.

1580
01:35:28.855 --> 01:35:29.940
Dude!

1581
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.448
Hey, Kyle. Give me that.

1582
01:35:42.661 --> 01:35:45.163
You're not
anti-technology. You're...

1583
01:35:48.375 --> 01:35:49.751
You're awesome.

1584
01:35:55.090 --> 01:35:56.966
- They're coming.
- What?

1585
01:35:56.967 --> 01:35:59.343
Go up to the roof and find somewhere
to hide with the kids, okay?

1586
01:35:59.344 --> 01:36:01.096
No, you're not going down there.

1587
01:36:01.596 --> 01:36:03.597
It's the only way to end this.
This is the only way we go home.

1588
01:36:03.598 --> 01:36:05.933
We don't have to go home. We can just
go to Canada and be the Andersons.

1589
01:36:05.934 --> 01:36:07.518
- Please, Dad.
- It's too late for that, Beans.

1590
01:36:07.519 --> 01:36:09.603
No. You're not giving
yourself up to them.

1591
01:36:09.604 --> 01:36:11.815
No. I'm getting us home.

1592
01:36:12.524 --> 01:36:13.692
Okay.

1593
01:36:17.279 --> 01:36:18.280
I got a plan.

1594
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:23.243
Look, I need to be that
guy one last time for us.

1595
01:36:24.286 --> 01:36:26.245
Dad. There's too many of 'em.

1596
01:36:26.246 --> 01:36:27.872
Well, I have something
they don't have.

1597
01:36:29.165 --> 01:36:30.417
Kyllboi.

1598
01:36:31.877 --> 01:36:34.295
That's your comms. You're my eyes and
my ears, okay? I'm counting on you.

1599
01:36:34.296 --> 01:36:36.046
Let's go.

1600
01:36:36.047 --> 01:36:37.257
Move out, Kyllboi.

1601
01:36:37.966 --> 01:36:40.093
<i>Hey, Kyle, you're on
the same channel as me.</i>

1602
01:36:43.221 --> 01:36:46.182
I want every inch of
this atrium covered.

1603
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.294
Movement on the elevator!

1604
01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:17.004
The elevator door. Now!

1605
01:37:17.005 --> 01:37:20.217
You see a shot, you take it,
because, believe me, he will.

1606
01:37:22.302 --> 01:37:23.302
You got a shot?

1607
01:37:23.303 --> 01:37:24.763
Negative. I don't see him yet.

1608
01:37:51.623 --> 01:37:53.123
He's not here.

1609
01:37:53.124 --> 01:37:54.209
Wait.

1610
01:37:57.295 --> 01:37:58.295
What do ya got?

1611
01:37:59.756 --> 01:38:01.424
Take cover!

1612
01:38:04.177 --> 01:38:05.554
Holy shit.

1613
01:38:06.304 --> 01:38:07.931
Hey. See anybody?

1614
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.645
He's up there!

1615
01:38:14.145 --> 01:38:15.145
Shit.

1616
01:38:17.274 --> 01:38:18.649
Talk to me, Kyle.

1617
01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:20.067
You're my eyes.

1618
01:38:20.068 --> 01:38:21.778
You're clear on
your right. Go now.

1619
01:38:27.617 --> 01:38:29.035
<i>Dad, man on your left.</i>

1620
01:38:36.835 --> 01:38:38.879
<i>Dad, are you okay? Man ahead.</i>

1621
01:38:42.591 --> 01:38:43.758
Man on your six.

1622
01:38:45.802 --> 01:38:46.969
<i>Great job, Kyle.</i>

1623
01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:48.305
<i>I'm on it, Dad.</i>

1624
01:38:49.639 --> 01:38:50.890
<i>Talk to me, Kyle.</i>

1625
01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.892
They've got the drone.

1626
01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:54.603
<i>Look out. Behind the curtain.</i>

1627
01:38:57.230 --> 01:38:58.440
<i>Come on, Dad. Get him.</i>

1628
01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:01.693
You again.

1629
01:39:02.611 --> 01:39:04.371
They mopped your ass up
off aisle three, huh?

1630
01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:07.363
Gonna need that mop again.

1631
01:39:13.288 --> 01:39:14.539
Gwen, where the hell are you?

1632
01:39:16.207 --> 01:39:17.250
<i>Gwen?</i>

1633
01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:20.211
- <i>Gwen?</i>
- McCaffrey?

1634
01:39:20.212 --> 01:39:21.420
<i>What's going on?</i>

1635
01:39:21.421 --> 01:39:23.130
Kid's got the drone.

1636
01:39:23.131 --> 01:39:24.299
Find him.

1637
01:39:25.467 --> 01:39:26.926
Call it off, Dad!

1638
01:39:26.927 --> 01:39:28.470
Hold your fire!

1639
01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:31.138
Change your mind, Sean?

1640
01:39:31.139 --> 01:39:33.600
No. But here's your chance to.

1641
01:39:34.643 --> 01:39:35.893
Call it off now.

1642
01:39:35.894 --> 01:39:39.688
You don't have it in you to
kill your own flesh and blood.

1643
01:39:39.689 --> 01:39:42.483
I, on the other hand,
do have it in me.

1644
01:39:42.484 --> 01:39:43.860
Let him have it!

1645
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.425
Go. Underneath. Go.

1646
01:40:08.426 --> 01:40:09.426
Wait. No.

1647
01:40:09.427 --> 01:40:11.221
Look after your brothers.
Don't make a sound.

1648
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:13.598
Do not leave Max,
whatever happens.

1649
01:40:30.657 --> 01:40:31.783
Jessica.

1650
01:40:33.535 --> 01:40:35.203
Is that you?

1651
01:40:37.581 --> 01:40:39.039
Talk to me, Kyle.

1652
01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:40.624
<i>Gwen's up here.</i>

1653
01:40:40.625 --> 01:40:43.127
I know the sound of an empty
gun when I hear one, sweetie.

1654
01:40:43.128 --> 01:40:46.548
So why don't we make
this real easy, shall we?

1655
01:40:49.259 --> 01:40:50.886
Unless you think
you can take me.

1656
01:40:51.928 --> 01:40:53.889
I think Mom's gonna fight her.

1657
01:41:04.399 --> 01:41:05.566
You think you can beat me

1658
01:41:05.567 --> 01:41:09.278
because you took some kickboxing
classes at the Y and wear Lululemon?

1659
01:41:09.279 --> 01:41:10.739
Ooh, no.

1660
01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.248
Learn that in class?

1661
01:41:20.832 --> 01:41:21.832
Yeah.

1662
01:41:21.833 --> 01:41:24.169
You know I do this
for a living, right?

1663
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:27.296
While you were popping out
brats and clipping coupons,

1664
01:41:27.297 --> 01:41:29.465
I was assassinating dictators.

1665
01:41:29.466 --> 01:41:32.468
So, why don't you
go back to the PTA?

1666
01:41:32.469 --> 01:41:33.970
'Cause you're a joke.

1667
01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.224
Kyle, what do you see?

1668
01:41:39.976 --> 01:41:42.856
All right, there's nine guys left.
Four to your right, five ahead of you.

1669
01:42:15.095 --> 01:42:16.721
<i>I'm out of ammo, Kyle.</i>

1670
01:42:18.723 --> 01:42:21.059
Find cover, Dad. A man coming.
Get over the low wall. Now.

1671
01:42:24.688 --> 01:42:26.855
Kyle, could have mentioned
that table, buddy.

1672
01:42:26.856 --> 01:42:27.899
<i>Sorry.</i>

1673
01:42:38.326 --> 01:42:39.953
Take out the one
on the left now.

1674
01:42:42.205 --> 01:42:43.999
Dad, hold on. We gotta move.

1675
01:43:01.725 --> 01:43:04.059
<i>Kyle. That guy below, chase
him through the foyer.</i>

1676
01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:05.520
Okay, I'm going.
I'm chasing him.

1677
01:43:06.021 --> 01:43:07.230
<i>Keep him coming.</i>

1678
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:09.482
<i>He's coming right at me.</i>

1679
01:43:24.623 --> 01:43:26.666
Take Max. I gotta go help Mom.

1680
01:43:27.417 --> 01:43:28.460
<i>Talk to me, Kyle.</i>

1681
01:43:29.419 --> 01:43:30.961
<i>Two left, including granddad.</i>

1682
01:43:30.962 --> 01:43:32.005
<i>Man on your right!</i>

1683
01:43:50.148 --> 01:43:52.316
Wouldn't go that way
if I were you, Sean.

1684
01:43:52.317 --> 01:43:54.653
Dad, Mom's hurt.
We're in big trouble.

1685
01:43:57.739 --> 01:43:58.823
Little brats.

1686
01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:15.799
I was wrong about you, Sean.

1687
01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:18.760
You're no use to me.

1688
01:44:19.844 --> 01:44:21.555
Family have made you weak.

1689
01:44:22.597 --> 01:44:25.976
You can't even focus on the
fight you're in because of them.

1690
01:44:33.191 --> 01:44:35.443
Hi. Going somewhere?

1691
01:44:36.027 --> 01:44:37.654
Don't worry about
her. She's great.

1692
01:44:38.947 --> 01:44:41.323
You know, that move you
pulled back there, little one?

1693
01:44:41.324 --> 01:44:43.285
That was a very bad idea.

1694
01:44:46.997 --> 01:44:50.666
Look. For what it's worth, killing minors
is the least favorite part of my job.

1695
01:44:50.667 --> 01:44:52.376
Now, who's first?

1696
01:44:52.377 --> 01:44:54.254
We're not done!

1697
01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:57.507
Mom. No, Mom!

1698
01:45:03.722 --> 01:45:04.890
Bang.

1699
01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:17.902
Mama.

1700
01:45:17.903 --> 01:45:19.778
Oh, come on.

1701
01:45:19.779 --> 01:45:21.239
Just die.

1702
01:45:23.116 --> 01:45:24.326
Mama.

1703
01:45:26.244 --> 01:45:27.245
Mama.

1704
01:45:28.371 --> 01:45:29.372
Mama.

1705
01:45:32.667 --> 01:45:33.752
Look at this.

1706
01:45:36.755 --> 01:45:38.465
You can't be serious.

1707
01:46:12.624 --> 01:46:15.501
Not quite the decathlete
we once were, huh?

1708
01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:17.295
Sorry, kids. It's
nothing personal.

1709
01:46:18.296 --> 01:46:19.923
Maybe a little.

1710
01:46:22.592 --> 01:46:24.010
Here we go again.

1711
01:46:25.929 --> 01:46:27.806
She's like <i>The Little
Engine That Could.</i>

1712
01:46:35.772 --> 01:46:37.649
There's nine other
events, bitch.

1713
01:46:39.943 --> 01:46:41.570
Oh, my God. Mom.

1714
01:47:08.179 --> 01:47:11.056
Far as I'm concerned,
this is an act of mercy.

1715
01:47:11.057 --> 01:47:15.019
I'm saving you 20 more
years of selling used cars.

1716
01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:16.396
Certified pre-owned.

1717
01:47:18.523 --> 01:47:19.524
Goodbye, Sean.

1718
01:47:20.775 --> 01:47:22.736
Grandpa! Wait!

1719
01:47:24.446 --> 01:47:26.864
I know you think that
we probably hate you

1720
01:47:26.865 --> 01:47:29.867
for everything that's happened
these past few days, and...

1721
01:47:29.868 --> 01:47:31.077
and maybe we should.

1722
01:47:32.287 --> 01:47:36.958
But I've learned that family is the most
important thing in the entire world.

1723
01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:42.756
And when I look at you, I don't
just see a cold-blooded killer.

1724
01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:44.883
I see my grandpa.

1725
01:47:52.182 --> 01:47:54.726
And maybe there's a way
for us to move forward...

1726
01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.313
as a family.

1727
01:47:59.981 --> 01:48:03.735
Kid, if you think this little
speech is gonna win me over...

1728
01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.321
Honestly...

1729
01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:11.243
I was just hoping it would buy
him enough time to do this.

1730
01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:18.792
Oh, baby.

1731
01:48:19.834 --> 01:48:21.086
- Dad.
- Hey.

1732
01:48:22.921 --> 01:48:23.963
Thank you.

1733
01:48:23.964 --> 01:48:25.465
Hi!

1734
01:48:26.091 --> 01:48:28.176
Wow!

1735
01:48:51.449 --> 01:48:53.659
<i>Good afternoon, and welcome
to the news at noon.</i>

1736
01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:57.496
<i>While details are continuing to emerge
about a covert paramilitary group...</i>

1737
01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:58.539
Thanks.

1738
01:48:58.540 --> 01:49:00.207
<i>Responsible for
high-profile assassinations</i>

1739
01:49:00.208 --> 01:49:02.042
<i>reportedly spanning decades,</i>

1740
01:49:02.043 --> 01:49:04.503
<i>this bombshell story was broken</i>

1741
01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:08.133
<i>by a high school newspaper
reporter, Nina Morgan.</i>

1742
01:49:15.682 --> 01:49:17.141
And you're dead.

1743
01:49:17.142 --> 01:49:19.310
That's bullshit. You said
there'd be two hostiles.

1744
01:49:19.311 --> 01:49:22.021
I lied. But, Sam, that was
better. Take him down harder.

1745
01:49:22.022 --> 01:49:23.105
I didn't wanna hurt the guy.

1746
01:49:23.106 --> 01:49:25.608
No, he'll be fine. He's
small, but he's very strong.

1747
01:49:25.609 --> 01:49:28.986
Hey, excuse me. Why don't you get
thrown against a truck 20 times?

1748
01:49:28.987 --> 01:49:30.696
Because my name's
on the letterhead.

1749
01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:31.615
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1750
01:49:31.616 --> 01:49:33.617
Hey, guys. I have a
family commitment.

1751
01:49:34.117 --> 01:49:36.119
Augie, you take it
from here, okay?

1752
01:49:38.246 --> 01:49:39.706
Let's pick up the pace!

1753
01:49:40.248 --> 01:49:42.124
I'm gonna be gone for
the next few days!

1754
01:49:42.125 --> 01:49:44.044
I want you to remember me!

1755
01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:00.392
Hey, it's time to go.

1756
01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:02.229
Okay, people. I'm out.

1757
01:50:03.230 --> 01:50:04.396
Guys, come on.

1758
01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:06.232
We gotta beat the traffic!

1759
01:50:06.233 --> 01:50:07.483
Oh, come on.

1760
01:50:07.484 --> 01:50:09.818
No, I cannot show up to
school in this monstrosity.

1761
01:50:09.819 --> 01:50:11.612
- How could you do this to me?
- Don't blame me.

1762
01:50:11.613 --> 01:50:14.531
Levon applied all the discounts and
all the points. Didn't you hear?

1763
01:50:14.532 --> 01:50:16.992
We are platinum elite
superior diamond members.

1764
01:50:16.993 --> 01:50:19.036
Okay. I got the
snacks. I got the maps.

1765
01:50:19.037 --> 01:50:20.412
- Let's do this.
- Nice.

1766
01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.539
- Hey, phones, please.
- For real?

1767
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.166
Yeah. Catch it.

1768
01:50:24.167 --> 01:50:25.376
There you go.

1769
01:50:25.377 --> 01:50:28.087
- Thank you.
- If you throw this away, I will kill you.

1770
01:50:28.088 --> 01:50:29.005
- God, gross.
- Oh, gross.

1771
01:50:29.006 --> 01:50:30.548
You gonna be doing that
all the way to California?

1772
01:50:30.549 --> 01:50:31.882
- Yes. All the way.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1773
01:50:31.883 --> 01:50:33.008
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1774
01:50:33.009 --> 01:50:35.177
- I'm going. Here, scooch.
- And I will take those.

1775
01:50:35.178 --> 01:50:36.680
- Beep, beep.
- Here we go.

1776
01:50:38.848 --> 01:50:41.392
One, two, three!

1777
01:50:41.393 --> 01:50:44.145
Road trip!

1778
01:52:15.445 --> 01:52:17.071
Oh, my God. Guys,
I almost forgot.

1779
01:52:17.072 --> 01:52:18.155
What? Yeah?

1780
01:52:18.156 --> 01:52:20.951
- Say goodbye to these.
- No!

1781
01:52:24.788 --> 01:52:25.789
Why?

1782
01:52:27.958 --> 01:52:29.083
Oh, my God.

1783
01:52:29.084 --> 01:52:30.085
