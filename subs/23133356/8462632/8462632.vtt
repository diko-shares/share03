1
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.893
- Are you scared?

2
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.853
- Yeah.

3
00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:13.200
Put a little bit of music, Russ.

4
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.660
- Getting a little
tiff, ruin the mood.

5
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.160
- Oh, come on, old boy.

6
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.180
- Precisely what
I'm doing, old chum.

7
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.013
Precisely.

8
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.753
- ] And when was the last time

9
00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:24.586
we saw these signs of life?

10
00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:26.493
- About 10 miles back, I'd say.

11
00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.760
- Not a single house.

12
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.930
Where are you taking us, Russ?

13
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.943
- Hey, it wasn't my idea?

14
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.073
- What do you
see out there, Laurie?

15
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.169
What'd you say?

16
00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.002
What?

17
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.873
- I saw someone in the woods.

18
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.700
- Stop messing, you had me.

19
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.540
- Mr. Dean Lawrence.

20
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.490
He was right out there in the woods.

21
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.110
He asked me if he could be my plus one

22
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.760
to tonight's private engagement.

23
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.470
You don't mind, do you?

24
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.790
- Very funny.

25
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.440
You know, I would laugh if you're acting

26
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.246
had any ballast to it, whatsoever.

27
00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:03.413
- If it didn't,
why did you say I had you?

28
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.300
- I can confirm
what Laurie's saying.

29
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.590
Wasn't my fault.

30
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.570
I saw something and I swerved around.

31
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.340
I think it was her mystery
man trying to hit her eye.

32
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.440
- Russ, you sure you can
see out of that mask?

33
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.090
- I told you so already, Maddy.

34
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.250
I didn't get us to start driving blind.

35
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.710
I saw something in the
road and I swerved around.

36
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.730
I swear, under oath.

37
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.563
You know,

38
00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:27.060
if our family's quack operation
ever falls by the wayside,

39
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.273
I'll save us all by becoming a
stunt driver for the kitchen.

40
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.600
You're safe with me, darling.

41
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.640
- Haha! Russ.

42
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.147
- I'm gonna take
that laugh as a genuine one,

43
00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:38.703
why don't you come over here.

44
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.910
- If you're not careful,
we're gonna ship you to Cuba.

45
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.590
- Oh, did you guys hear that?

46
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.720
Doesn't Madeline say the darnedest thing?

47
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.060
Isn't she a gas?

48
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.560
- We could just take these off, you know?

49
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.060
- Of course. Of course we could.

50
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.680
But then how would we get our kicks?

51
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.390
We gotta get in the spirit of the night!

52
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.670
- Maybe it's not so bad there.

53
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.200
Maybe you fit right in.

54
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.903
Especially now that the
missile crisis is over.

55
00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:01.833
- Are you a sympathizer, Maddy?

56
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.500
Want me to turn you in?

57
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.550
We got a commie!

58
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.690
We got a commie!

59
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.830
- Are you a think?

60
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.773
- Oh, you're just
trying to make me crash.

61
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.500
Your secret's safe with me.

62
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.600
I'm not sure about Dean and Laurie though.

63
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.150
- We don't even
know what you're on about.

64
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.987
We almost there.

65
00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:20.970
- You got ants
in your pants, Laurie?

66
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.376
- Maybe I do, Russ.

67
00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:24.150
- Well, you should
get that checked out.

68
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.650
Dean, did you know about that?

69
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.110
- Knock it off, Russ.

70
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.910
Or I'm gonna be sour all over again.

71
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.340
- All right, come on everyone.

72
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.640
We're just a little
gassed up for our weekend.

73
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.380
- Dean is right.

74
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.780
Let's all just have a blast.

75
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.390
- Quaint cottage
on a Halloween night

76
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.040
in the middle of the woods.

77
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.000
No sweat.

78
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.290
- You're gonna
send this car straight

79
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.613
to the boneyard, Russ.

80
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.853
Besides, you know,

81
00:05:52.853 --> 00:05:55.770
we could never use any of our
family's properties up here.

82
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.620
First, the cleaning staff
talks, then the cooks,

83
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.100
then the groundskeeper,
chauffeurs and security detail.

84
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.933
And the next thing you know,

85
00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:04.830
our business is not so mysteriously leaked

86
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.483
to the supermarket tabloids.

87
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.850
Or worse yet,

88
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.550
to our parents without
being able to trace back

89
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.653
and reprimand who started the wildfire?

90
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.817
No, this is perfectly off
the radar, so to speak.

91
00:06:17.817 --> 00:06:20.280
- Oh, so whose
place are we going to?

92
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.900
- Oh, if you all
don't take a chill pill,

93
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.543
I'm gonna slip something into your drinks.

94
00:06:23.543 --> 00:06:27.240
Get the old St. Barb's family recipe

95
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.730
that Marilyn Monroe special exit.

96
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.710
- Oof, too soon, old boy.

97
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.450
Too soon, unreal.

98
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.190
And you know, how would that play out?

99
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.350
Already on our family's snuff as it is,

100
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.020
bears of the company
following Monroe's footsteps.

101
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.210
- My mom is Deborah
Kerr in the opening scene

102
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.820
of the innocence every night before bed,

103
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.130
on her knees, prayer hands.

104
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.660
All I want to do is love the
children, not destroy them.

105
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.980
More than anything.

106
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.540
I love the children.

107
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.870
More than anything, they
need affection, love,

108
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.580
someone who will belong to them

109
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.983
and to whom they will belong.

110
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.460
- How many times
did you go see that Laurie?

111
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.780
- Enough.

112
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.060
- I'll say I could
barely get through it once.

113
00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.440
It was so scary.

114
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.150
I think I was watching
the inside of my hands,

115
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.950
covering my eyes through most of it.

116
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:18.773
- Yeah,

117
00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:21.300
I think all our parents have
that worry about right now.

118
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.220
- Why did you call
them that anyway, Russ?

119
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.360
- St. Barb?

120
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.710
- Perpetuate?

121
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.543
- I don't know,

122
00:07:26.543 --> 00:07:28.380
some no name board member was annoying me

123
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.270
with some story how it got its name

124
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.613
from the Feast of St.
Barbara or something.

125
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.520
Kind of catch you though.

126
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.930
- Oh, no name board member?

127
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.520
- Our parents would bury us

128
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.950
and dig us up again
every week out of spite.

129
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.880
If we went out like that,

130
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.460
they couldn't handle the
PR mess it would cause.

131
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.763
- They would drown
me in lawsuits in heaven.

132
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.470
- I'm glad to know
they wouldn't take the time

133
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.303
to weep for us.

134
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.620
First, it would be all boardroom meetings

135
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.910
and quarterly figures.

136
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.743
- We don't know.

137
00:07:54.743 --> 00:07:56.340
It was the Kennedy's anyway.

138
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.660
- We're back to Maryland?

139
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.493
- Yeah.

140
00:07:58.493 --> 00:07:59.761
How about we don't take her exit.

141
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:01.233
- Or just one Kennedy.

142
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.803
Or that.

143
00:08:03.803 --> 00:08:06.690
Either way the heat will
be off our family soon.

144
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.250
It was a prescription bottle

145
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.690
and it didn't say to take that much.

146
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.563
I guarantee you, it was
the old Kennedy curse.

147
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.120
- Kennedy curse?

148
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.080
What's that?

149
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.070
- I don't know.

150
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.540
Maybe I just made it up.

151
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.050
- Now, who says
the darnedest things?

152
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.660
- According to our parents,

153
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.030
the only way that any of
us should go on living

154
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.980
is married with kids.

155
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.813
- Yes,

156
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.992
I am a walking cobweb
according to my mother.

157
00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:32.970
- Yeah.

158
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.380
What's wrong with us anyway?

159
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.780
We should have at least a
half dozen little fries,

160
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.950
running around by now.

161
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.270
- Oh, come on.

162
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.580
What's the point of us being
where we are with our access

163
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.463
if we don't push back against
an arms a healthy amount.

164
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.550
- Healthy?

165
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.383
- You're here.

166
00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:49.216
The man that made a point.

167
00:08:49.216 --> 00:08:50.580
And it's a mighty fine one.

168
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.670
And I'll hear no more of
it in this court of law.

169
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.290
- That's where I'll
be talking to my parents next.

170
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.030
If I don't get the show on the road,

171
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.100
they're going to legally
change my middle name

172
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.410
to Cobweb-Spinster.

173
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.243
- Yeah.

174
00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:03.235
Russ, get the show on the road.

175
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.180
- Russ, Russ.

176
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.440
Guys, what on earth?

177
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.363
- Hey, Russ.

178
00:09:11.363 --> 00:09:12.196
- Wake up.
- Russ.

179
00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:13.029
- Wake up, man.

180
00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:14.472
- What was that?

181
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.053
That's not funny.

182
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.690
Russ, no one is laughing.

183
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.276
I thought you were really hurt,

184
00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:28.578
laying rubber like
that, this car is toast.

185
00:09:28.578 --> 00:09:33.210
- Come on.

186
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.043
Come on,

187
00:09:34.043 --> 00:09:35.760
it's a little scare on a Halloween night.

188
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.113
Exactly what we needed.

189
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.320
You okay back there, Dean?

190
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.190
Laurie?

191
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.520
- Haha! Russ.

192
00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.250
Yeah, you really got us good.

193
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.310
- We're just doing my
best impression of a dead man.

194
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.950
- And now that we
have a proper heart attack,

195
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.560
I believe my dear friend
Russ here is gonna get us

196
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.850
to the cottage safely
and without interruption.

197
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.500
Now, isn't that right?

198
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.790
- Sure.

199
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.623
But you know,

200
00:09:57.623 --> 00:09:58.800
I think it was Laurie's mystery man

201
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.330
that stepped out right in front of me.

202
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.803
Am I the only one that saw that?

203
00:10:01.803 --> 00:10:03.690
- Give it a rest, Russ.

204
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.620
You got us.

205
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.463
You win.

206
00:10:06.794 --> 00:10:07.830
- Okay.

207
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.663
Okay.

208
00:10:11.357 --> 00:10:14.460
But you all can never take
away how badly I got you off.

209
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.160
Oh, I can't wait to tell everyone.

210
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:22.330
All right, you guys,

211
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.200
you guys good back there?

212
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.430
- Hanging on.

213
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:27.330
- Barely.

214
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.450
- So, we sure
Johnny said it was okay

215
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.070
if we use his cottage?

216
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:35.903
- Johnny?

217
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.480
- Oh, why didn't
Annette ride with us?

218
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.380
- I think she had plans

219
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.600
but she's going to join us later.

220
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.050
- What kind of plans?

221
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.940
- She had to
convince a certain gentleman

222
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.620
to join us this evening

223
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.773
and apparently he needed
a little extra coax.

224
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.960
- That's all well and dandy.

225
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.700
But how about the cottage?

226
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.810
- Let's ask Laurie.

227
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:01.650
- Laurie,

228
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.690
Maddy said it was you who
made these plans for us.

229
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.060
- He says nobody comes
up here this time of year.

230
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.890
We've got the whole place to ourselves.

231
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.810
The party is already well underway.

232
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.370
We are fashionably late.

233
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.203
You see?

234
00:11:12.203 --> 00:11:13.083
Off the radar.

235
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.060
- Laurie?

236
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.740
- Yes, Mr. Russell.

237
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.940
- Laying on me.

238
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.230
You fresh with Johnny?

239
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.063
- Tune him out, Laurie.

240
00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:25.163
- No, I'm just
looking out for a friend.

241
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.030
- Even if I said no,
would you believe me, Russ?

242
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.800
You asked the question in such a way

243
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.410
that I look guilty no matter what I say.

244
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.253
Isn't that so?

245
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.573
Your turn.

246
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.983
- My turn?

247
00:11:51.673 --> 00:11:53.490
I don't really know what you mean.

248
00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.343
But,

249
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.216
our father who aren't in heaven

250
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.043
hall be then,

251
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.743
thy kingdom come,

252
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.663
thy will be done,

253
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.023
on earth as it is in heaven.

254
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.860
Give us this day our daily bread

255
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.280
and forgive us our trespasses

256
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.133
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

257
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.990
And lead us not into temptation

258
00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.833
but deliver us from evil.

259
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.480
- Are you serious?

260
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.623
Who's the commie now?

261
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.693
- For thy is the kingdom

262
00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:42.847
and the power and the
glory forever and ever.

263
00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.520
- Should we recite
the national anthem next?

264
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.540
- I filmed that, pleasant.

265
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.513
Unexpected certainly but
pleasant nonetheless.

266
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.950
- And if you aren't a good citizen,

267
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:58.860
as teamed by a constantly
changing construct

268
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.950
with no real conviction
or nail down definition,

269
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:02.850
well then you see,

270
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.970
we will maroon you on a deserted island

271
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.160
where you'll be forced to
sew the President's clothing

272
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.850
with only the tiniest little
needles known to mankind

273
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.853
as a life sentence
until your dying breath.

274
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.630
Now this, this is a first.

275
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.163
This is an exclusive.

276
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.460
Uncle Sam will pay you a visit.

277
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.680
Pry from your mother's arms if need be.

278
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.580
So be a good little citizen

279
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.393
and do what we tell you to do.

280
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.730
Rather think what we
think you should think,

281
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.230
even if it doesn't make sense,

282
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.560
especially if it doesn't make sense.

283
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.070
Especially when there's
no redeemable purpose

284
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.560
or tangible agreed
upon, collective effort.

285
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.540
Just poverty of the spirit.

286
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.280
Poverty of the imagination.

287
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.870
Oh, yes.

288
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.640
Be sure to report on your neighbors.

289
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.070
- Factor is good for the soul.

290
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.500
My boy here is a scholar and a pastor.

291
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.300
He's gonna write the next
great American novel, I think.

292
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.710
- Perfect timing.

293
00:14:07.719 --> 00:14:09.435
- Look.

294
00:14:09.435 --> 00:14:11.880
- Oh, look at this place.

295
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.260
It's perfect.

296
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.330
- Thank you, Johnny.

297
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:16.950
Or should I say, Laurie.

298
00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.540
- You should stop talking.

299
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.570
- Suck up to me, I'm a cool head.

300
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.940
Apparently we are the only ones who drove.

301
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.203
Everybody else is local.

302
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.580
You sure Johnny's not gonna be here?

303
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.500
- I genuinely don't know Russ.

304
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.153
And we will find out soon enough.

305
00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:38.812
Go.

306
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.470
- We should-

307
00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:55.055
- Too sweet.

308
00:14:59.322 --> 00:15:00.155
- Are you coming?

309
00:15:00.155 --> 00:15:01.110
- Oh, come on.

310
00:15:13.622 --> 00:15:15.372
So this is all I had.

311
00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.720
- Oh, we'll have
to see who gets this.

312
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.460
- Let's see about it later.

313
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.350
- You're right, you're right.

314
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.310
Who knows?

315
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.490
Maybe we all have tile on the
bed by the end of the night.

316
00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.380
- Time will tell.

317
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.149
- Good stuff in here.

318
00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:35.011
Good.

319
00:15:48.258 --> 00:15:53.258
- Look at this.

320
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.350
- Be sure to wash
behind your ears, now.

321
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.670
- We're supposed to do that.

322
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.470
- Russ and I
should sleep in there.

323
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:05.303
- Yeah, certainly.

324
00:16:05.303 --> 00:16:08.730
It would be all so comfortable
for all of 30 minutes.

325
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.870
You could even draw that

326
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.030
and maybe you'd wake
up a couple of prunes.

327
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.580
- Oh, I've always
wanted to be one of those.

328
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.650
And I'm sure somewhere deep down.

329
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.563
Somewhere so unknowable and ponderous.

330
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.994
Have you always wanted to be a prune?

331
00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:24.888
- What?

332
00:16:24.888 --> 00:16:26.310
- A prune.

333
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.630
- That sounds like some new jive,

334
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.710
I'm unfamiliar with.

335
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.089
But given the choice, I
guess I'd be a watermelon.

336
00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:34.299
- A what?

337
00:16:34.299 --> 00:16:35.132
- Why?

338
00:16:35.132 --> 00:16:36.063
Anything.

339
00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:36.896
- Fair point.

340
00:16:36.896 --> 00:16:38.430
Never you mind, darling.

341
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.650
- Wish I could take a picture

342
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.770
of the two of you right now.

343
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:41.910
- Why don't you then?

344
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.743
- You know I would

345
00:16:42.743 --> 00:16:45.960
but I don't know where I put the camera.

346
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.138
Besides, we must assemble in the kitchen.

347
00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:49.560
Dearest Maddy and Laurie,

348
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.330
your presence has been
officially requested.

349
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.494
- We are being shown in.

350
00:16:53.494 --> 00:16:57.387
It must totally work out.

351
00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:01.691
- Just with the bartender.

352
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:03.060
the two of you.

353
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.250
What a couple of beauties
like you doing this far up

354
00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.403
in the country?

355
00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:07.986
- Ravishing.

356
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.073
- Someone say a toast.

357
00:17:10.073 --> 00:17:12.180
So I can down this drink
and immediately get

358
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.508
to drinking another.

359
00:17:13.508 --> 00:17:14.700
- Alright.

360
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.700
Hey, it's a Halloween, to
all of you, to our families,

361
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.603
to us as the company's future, to-

362
00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:27.510
- And majority shareholders.

363
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:29.400
- Here you are.

364
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.450
- Well that too.

365
00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.520
And until then, keeping our
feet firmly on the ground

366
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.486
to unghoulish night.

367
00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:39.254
- Cheers!

368
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.220
- I don't know about you old boy,

369
00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.210
but I'm trying to blast off

370
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.473
and be the first man on the moon.

371
00:17:47.473 --> 00:17:49.290
But first, let's get a bit off the fly.

372
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.123
- Cheers.

373
00:17:50.123 --> 00:17:51.210
- Yep, he's gonna win the race.

374
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.140
- I thought there wasn't one.

375
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.713
- Then why are we all in it?

376
00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:55.560
- Another, I need another.

377
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:56.560
- Absolutely.

378
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.890
- I made it myself.

379
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.760
- Guess what?

380
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.953
It's going straight to all of your hips.

381
00:18:06.024 --> 00:18:06.857
- Gladly, that looks incredible.

382
00:18:09.597 --> 00:18:10.430
- And Laurie,

383
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.150
you could serve that at the palm course.

384
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.130
- Very fancy, Laurie.

385
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.373
- I guess you're not gonna
eat with your fingers.

386
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.930
- Oh, first try.

387
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.310
Oh, bon appetit.

388
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.750
- Excellent.

389
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.040
- Halloween cake.

390
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.773
You know it's unexpected,
but a nice touch.

391
00:18:29.122 --> 00:18:30.039
- So sharp,

392
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.437
griffin is in the light

393
00:18:35.894 --> 00:18:38.177
cuts right through the cake.

394
00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.190
- Guys, do we
even know anyone here?

395
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.780
- Good question, honey.

396
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.060
Not a soul. Not a soul.

397
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.893
- Yes.

398
00:18:45.893 --> 00:18:46.860
Anonymity.

399
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.170
Isn't that what we
ordered up this evening?

400
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.070
Although I hope they're aware.

401
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.333
We're with driving here.

402
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.070
- You have lifelong customers in us all.

403
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.923
- This Halloween cake, Laurie,
is not gonna last long.

404
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.160
Hey,

405
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.710
we'll get the stuff in the car.

406
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.180
Heaven to you.

407
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.290
Go boy.

408
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.180
- Brilliant idea, you two.

409
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.740
I'm sure it's solely
because of the two of you

410
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.246
that will be vacationing
in Havana next year.

411
00:19:19.246 --> 00:19:20.550
- Good one, Laurie.

412
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.383
Good one.

413
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.230
Hey, I'm just trying to help a friend.

414
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.880
You know how to set up a move.

415
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.530
Girls love that.

416
00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.363
- You know.

417
00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:38.190
We did hold hands in the
backseat for a second

418
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.570
and she is actually staring at me.

419
00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.630
- You see progress, boy,

420
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.218
you're up to here.

421
00:19:44.218 --> 00:19:47.760
And Johnny is nowhere to be found.

422
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.645
You can thank me later.

423
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.080
- You gentlemen need my help.

424
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.589
- Are you spying on us, Mad?

425
00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:54.818
- I would never.

426
00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:57.660
- A couple of tough
guys like us need help.

427
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.070
From whom?

428
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.305
- I'll leave
the door open for you.

429
00:20:00.305 --> 00:20:01.684
How's that?

430
00:20:08.815 --> 00:20:10.805
- Look who's spying now?

431
00:20:10.805 --> 00:20:11.638
- Okay.

432
00:20:11.638 --> 00:20:14.207
Okay.

433
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.440
- Maddy and Laurie,

434
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.943
look at you two, posing like pin ups.

435
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.533
Ready for your debut,

436
00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:51.641
society is

437
00:21:06.119 --> 00:21:08.536
- Come on, can I go?

438
00:21:17.952 --> 00:21:19.535
- Throw this party!

439
00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:42.857
Don't get tired.

440
00:21:42.857 --> 00:21:43.690
Come on!

441
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.113
Come on, we gotta drink!

442
00:21:46.113 --> 00:21:47.363
We gotta drink!

443
00:22:11.958 --> 00:22:14.209
- Did you hear that?

444
00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:15.096
Thank you.

445
00:22:15.096 --> 00:22:17.213
- Hear what?

446
00:22:17.213 --> 00:22:19.073
- I heard the car doors outside.

447
00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:20.490
- No, no, no, no, no.

448
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.710
Don't tell me your blitz already.

449
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.143
- No, I heard the car
doors being shut outside.

450
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.270
- You're sure?

451
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.213
Nice try, Laurie.

452
00:22:31.287 --> 00:22:32.245
- What?

453
00:22:32.245 --> 00:22:33.078
- Yeah, what?

454
00:22:33.078 --> 00:22:33.911
- She's clearly
trying to get back at me

455
00:22:33.911 --> 00:22:36.399
for the stunt I pulled earlier.

456
00:22:36.399 --> 00:22:37.816
- No, I'm not.

457
00:22:37.816 --> 00:22:39.900
- Oh no, I'm not.

458
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.920
What's the next part of your prank?

459
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.450
Huh?

460
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.300
- It's not funny.

461
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.273
- Okay, I'll go check.

462
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.590
- Don't fall for it, chump.

463
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.750
Maybe Laurie should go with him.

464
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.730
- We are all going.

465
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.620
- All right, let's go first.

466
00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.390
- My man has a mean ride hook,

467
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.283
stronger than Cassius Glaze.

468
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.423
The front door is open but
the car seems to be fine.

469
00:23:16.877 --> 00:23:19.020
- You heard the doors close?

470
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.460
- Yeah, that's what I heard.

471
00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.293
- Yeah,

472
00:23:21.293 --> 00:23:22.230
I know you're pulling my leg now

473
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.530
because I definitely
locked it, didn't I Dean?

474
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.180
See, nothing to worry about.

475
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.013
Come on.

476
00:23:32.003 --> 00:23:36.025
- Hey, come on.

477
00:23:36.025 --> 00:23:37.192
- Okay.
- Yeah.

478
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.373
- Bravo! Bravo!

479
00:23:54.927 --> 00:23:57.228
How I nearly jumped outta my body.

480
00:23:57.228 --> 00:23:59.700
- That really was too perfect.

481
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.290
- I saw you all heading
towards the front door

482
00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.490
at the same time.

483
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:05.010
- That is a
scare to remember Annette.

484
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.080
- Wow, what an entrance.

485
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.100
Thank you for that.

486
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.110
I won't be able to sleep
for God knows how long now.

487
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.164
- Well, hello, by the way.

488
00:24:12.164 --> 00:24:13.614
- Who dropped you off?

489
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.780
- Don't be howzy Russ.

490
00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:17.997
- Oh, I wanna know too.

491
00:24:17.997 --> 00:24:20.505
- I'm gonna leave you all to wonder.

492
00:24:20.505 --> 00:24:22.470
- In the spirit of the night.

493
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.870
- Building the mystery.

494
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.523
- Can we talk about this costume?

495
00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:28.650
- Yes, please explain yourself.

496
00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.990
Now, this isn't amazing?
- Yes.

497
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.038
With you looking not
amazing, I can't wear this.

498
00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.417
- Oh, agreed.

499
00:24:34.417 --> 00:24:36.750
- Well there are the masks.

500
00:24:40.052 --> 00:24:41.787
- This costume.

501
00:24:41.787 --> 00:24:45.150
- As you know, after
singing to the president,

502
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.670
I found myself too overwhelmed.

503
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.730
Did you know nothing
was the same after that?

504
00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.240
I called John Bobby and they
stopped inviting me around.

505
00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.470
You see?

506
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.833
I sent juicy letters, signed
in red lipstick kisses.

507
00:24:59.833 --> 00:25:03.150
Spray with their favorite perfume?

508
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.833
My perspiration.

509
00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:12.707
- Oh, man!

510
00:25:12.707 --> 00:25:14.820
- If you can believe it.

511
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.642
Someone told me my real
name is Norma Gina.

512
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.850
- A drink?

513
00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.530
- Oh yes please.

514
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.190
- Okay, I'll stop.

515
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.080
What is this?

516
00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.550
Hooch from your jailbird days?

517
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.410
- I was in a pinch.

518
00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.340
- Speaking of a pinch.

519
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.640
How about we make a pinch?

520
00:25:46.636 --> 00:25:49.050
- That is a fantastic idea, Laurie.

521
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:49.883
- Is it?

522
00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:50.716
- Yeah, why not.

523
00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:53.043
- Everyone, we have an announcement.

524
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.070
- We're gonna play one
round of hide and go seek.

525
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.714
Loser has to sleep in the car.

526
00:25:58.714 --> 00:25:59.964
- Who's gonna go?

527
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.530
- I vote, Dean.

528
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.363
- Me?

529
00:26:05.363 --> 00:26:06.196
- I second that.

530
00:26:06.196 --> 00:26:07.530
I second that.

531
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.570
- Alright. It's me, fine.

532
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.160
One condition.

533
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.430
You either have to hide
inside if you're so daring

534
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.610
or within 10 feet of the cottage.

535
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.220
Otherwise I may be searching until summer.

536
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.053
Agreed?

537
00:26:21.053 --> 00:26:21.886
- Believe me,

538
00:26:21.886 --> 00:26:23.970
old scholar boy here will
get out the measuring stick

539
00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:24.803
if he has to.

540
00:26:24.803 --> 00:26:26.730
- Hey, don't avoid the question.

541
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.563
- Agree.
- Agree.

542
00:26:27.563 --> 00:26:32.563
- And how about this spot
over here for counting?

543
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.200
Seems as good as eh.
- Alright.

544
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.300
I mean, you know, it
doesn't matter regardless.

545
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.070
I can't even see outside look at it.

546
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.530
- Well, it's not like
anybody's gonna hide in here.

547
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.280
- Count to 40, starting now.

548
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.470
- I hope you don't lose count.

549
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:51.960
Come find me.

550
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.793
Okay?

551
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.440
- You know what Laurie, I think I will.

552
00:27:18.317 --> 00:27:19.484
- Russ?
- What?

553
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.454
- I left this windows open.

554
00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:24.593
- I think had Matt.

555
00:27:24.593 --> 00:27:25.950
- I wish I could take credit for thinking

556
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.866
but this is dumb luck.

557
00:27:27.866 --> 00:27:32.448
- You sure about that?

558
00:27:35.064 --> 00:27:36.559
They won't notice.

559
00:27:36.559 --> 00:27:39.726
- We just have to be real, real quite.

560
00:27:44.385 --> 00:27:46.100
- We could just stay out here.

561
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.273
- This is a great idea.

562
00:27:47.273 --> 00:27:49.367
They'll never suspect anyone.

563
00:28:11.712 --> 00:28:13.598
- Should we split up?

564
00:28:13.598 --> 00:28:15.681
- I don't know.

565
00:28:22.735 --> 00:28:24.352
You like him don't you?

566
00:28:24.352 --> 00:28:28.123
I mean, I'm asking but
it's after this, right?

567
00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:29.973
Why has it never happened?

568
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.130
- Johnny?

569
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:33.450
- Thought that was finally over.

570
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.773
- It finally is.

571
00:28:35.898 --> 00:28:39.980
- How about we don't tell Johnny?

572
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.057
Put the sister on his place.

573
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:46.400
Also, I somehow convinced him

574
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.010
to let us use the place
without actually inviting him.

575
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.156
- How scandalous.

576
00:28:56.523 --> 00:28:57.843
Hey, what else?

577
00:28:58.861 --> 00:28:59.943
What it is? Tell me.

578
00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:03.930
- I can't say.

579
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.320
- You've known each
other since we were babies.

580
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.280
You can tell me.

581
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.560
- I mean, you already know, don't you?

582
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.430
Please, say you do.

583
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.903
So I don't have to say it out loud.

584
00:29:13.903 --> 00:29:16.320
- I wish I could read your
mind, but I don't know.

585
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.433
Laurie, I'm sorry.

586
00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.660
- There's always been rumors, you know,

587
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.310
but everybody's always hushed up.

588
00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.693
And then I have always been
fond of each other, you know.

589
00:29:31.751 --> 00:29:34.200
It's nothing, I'm sorry.

590
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.880
It's nothing.

591
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.462
- Whatever it is in here, besides,

592
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.590
I'm not gonna say anything.

593
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:43.710
When do I ever see Johnny
or care enough about him

594
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.240
to mention his name to other people?

595
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.740
- Yeah, I mean,

596
00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.450
that's perfect.
- Thank you.

597
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.860
- As long as it doesn't leave your lips,

598
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.560
that teens up here and then clear.

599
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.960
- I don't think I'm the one
you need to worry about though.

600
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.400
- Hey, by the end of the night,

601
00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.587
I will swear everyone
disagrees, just watch.

602
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.480
I guess you got me there.

603
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.850
- We haven't moved a muscle.

604
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:10.290
We're terrible at this game.

605
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.190
Are we staying here?

606
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.960
- You tell me.

607
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.793
- No. You know what?

608
00:30:13.793 --> 00:30:14.626
I'm going over here.

609
00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:15.459
It's dark.

610
00:32:04.883 --> 00:32:05.716
- 40.

611
00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:09.113
Ready or not, here I come.

612
00:32:31.293 --> 00:32:34.126
Oh, this is gonna be way too hard.

613
00:32:35.339 --> 00:32:37.006
You better be close.

614
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.120
All right.

615
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.110
Call me a poor sport.

616
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:48.270
But here's what's gonna happen.

617
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:50.692
I'm gonna search for three minutes

618
00:32:50.692 --> 00:32:52.593
and if I don't find anyone,

619
00:32:52.593 --> 00:32:54.120
you all lose from walking you out.

620
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.293
Now how's that sound?

621
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:06.430
- Boo!

622
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.170
- Well, you're welcome site.

623
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.080
Where are we going?

624
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.393
- Wait, wait, I need to ask you something.

625
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:23.730
- Yeah, surely.

626
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.820
What is it, Laurie?

627
00:33:27.592 --> 00:33:28.425
Anything?

628
00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:29.475
No, honestly, Laurie.

629
00:33:30.653 --> 00:33:32.163
- Are you okay with this?

630
00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:37.770
Because if you are, then
I'm okay with it too.

631
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:42.697
But if you're not, then I don't know.

632
00:33:45.797 --> 00:33:47.673
- What's okay with you?

633
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.763
I apologize, Laurie, but
call me off guard here.

634
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.913
- We share the same
great, great grandparents.

635
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:04.670
Is that okay with you?

636
00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:07.943
- Is that what's been bothering you?

637
00:34:09.552 --> 00:34:12.233
Is that why you've been
avoiding me the last few weeks?

638
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.253
While we're at it, I have
a question for you too.

639
00:34:30.371 --> 00:34:31.704
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

640
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.700
- Okay. Here's the truth of it.

641
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.290
We've been done for a while now

642
00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.420
and he doesn't wanna let it go.

643
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.073
Or for anyone else to know

644
00:34:41.073 --> 00:34:43.293
that it's over between us for that matter.

645
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.262
- You know, where there's an ending,

646
00:34:49.262 --> 00:34:51.184
there's also a beginning.

647
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:01.050
Alright, everyone game over.

648
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.069
I found Laurie, I give up.

649
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.902
- Okay.

650
00:35:03.902 --> 00:35:04.902
That's that.

651
00:35:05.748 --> 00:35:09.324
- Stop.

652
00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:10.157
Stop.

653
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.908
Didn't they say game over?

654
00:35:24.908 --> 00:35:25.749
- Game over?

655
00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:28.601
- Yeah.

656
00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:29.954
- Not for us.

657
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.763
- Hey.

658
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:40.620
- Laurie lost.

659
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.560
- Might have
been voluntarily even.

660
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.393
- Really?

661
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.870
Is that why she ran up to me?

662
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.623
- I guess I have to sleep
alone in the car tonight.

663
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.770
- Yeah, but well, I
could keep you company.

664
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.610
At least until you fall
asleep, if you want it.

665
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.598
- You would do that?

666
00:36:00.598 --> 00:36:02.940
- You don't
have to be coy around me.

667
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.650
- Yeah, surely.

668
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:05.750
- That would be great.

669
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.220
- Shall we?

670
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.150
- Yeah.

671
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.590
- What about the love birds?

672
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.820
- What about them?

673
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.260
Hmm?

674
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.460
- Let's give them a few.

675
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.073
They'll come in on their own time.

676
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.990
We're going inside.

677
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.403
See you soon, love birds.

678
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.940
- Drinks? Drinks?
- Yes. That'd be great.

679
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.773
Thanks Annette.

680
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.653
You know,

681
00:36:35.128 --> 00:36:38.460
I could stay even after you
fall asleep, if that's okay.

682
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.297
- Yeah, I might not sleep at all.

683
00:36:44.203 --> 00:36:46.623
- I've known you since
you were five years old.

684
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.310
- Are you getting sentimental right now?

685
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.471
- I suppose I am.

686
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.413
- Russ, when he was five.

687
00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.306
So mischievous yet so
boisterous and charming.

688
00:37:00.306 --> 00:37:02.743
- When I pushed you down
it's cause I liked you.

689
00:37:02.743 --> 00:37:04.530
- Oh, I knew I had those bruises

690
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.123
on my knees for a good reason.

691
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.700
What?

692
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.523
- Sorry, I thought I heard something.

693
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.880
- Are you trying to
scare me yet again, Russ?

694
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.803
- No, not this time.

695
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.110
Although as you're well aware,

696
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.240
I can't allow myself to be bested by net,

697
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.733
so I wouldn't rule it out
as a future possibility.

698
00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:32.073
- You are never gonna let that go.

699
00:37:33.132 --> 00:37:35.132
- I'll never let you go.

700
00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:47.483
- Very smooth, Russ.

701
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.520
I don't know why I just thought of this,

702
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.740
but you know what I saw when we got here?

703
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.330
- What?

704
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.190
- A shooting star.

705
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.540
It was right when we were
getting out of the car

706
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.059
and I was walking up to the front door.

707
00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:02.430
- Well, how was it?

708
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.850
- It's beautiful but I didn't
say anything to anyone.

709
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.843
Isn't that strange?

710
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.433
- You're gonna beat yourself
up about a shooting star.

711
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.923
Maybe it was made just for you.

712
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:16.680
What made you think of it?

713
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.150
- Just popped into my head.

714
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.023
Isn't that silly?

715
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:25.020
It was bold, bright, beautiful.

716
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.360
And it's streaked across
the black milky sky,

717
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.990
like an illuminated crayon like this.

718
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.443
And I don't know, made
me feel like a kid again.

719
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.445
- Five years old, perhaps.

720
00:38:43.445 --> 00:38:44.278
- Perhaps?

721
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:49.620
- Well, did you wish on me,
you know, wish upon a star?

722
00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.140
Can't see why it can't be a shooting one.

723
00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:52.973
- I didn't.

724
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:57.743
- Well,

725
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.110
maybe that's why it made
its way back to you.

726
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.613
An unfinished business.

727
00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:10.530
And-
- Well, I can't tell you.

728
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.730
- No?

729
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.470
- Well, then it won't come true.

730
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.613
Everyone knows that.

731
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.310
- Thought you might make an exception.

732
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.260
- Seven years.
- Seven years?

733
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.430
That's how long I have to wait.

734
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.800
Seven years, that's a long time.

735
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.300
- Did it seem like it was that long ago

736
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.530
that we were five years old

737
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.180
and your way of showing
me that you liked me

738
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.550
was by pushing me down
next to your favorite slide

739
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.513
on the playground.

740
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.420
- Seems like only yesterday

741
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.910
and you had to bring my
favorite slide into this.

742
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:45.453
- Well you see, time is
like that shooting star.

743
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.700
Seven years will pass by

744
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.713
before we even have the time to say.

745
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.347
A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.

746
00:39:55.347 --> 00:39:58.650
- You can come up with this stuff.

747
00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.773
- I'm just Madeline Green
and all I can be is me.

748
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.770
And of course I had to bring
your favorite slide into this.

749
00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.900
I consider you asking me
to go down it with you

750
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.700
to be our official first date.

751
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.533
- Ah, yes.

752
00:40:12.533 --> 00:40:13.538
Our first date.

753
00:40:13.538 --> 00:40:16.290
Paid for by the donations of a bunch

754
00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:20.010
of well-to-do wealthy families.

755
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.160
I wonder if we ever
remember to thank them.

756
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.933
- Somehow, I don't feel bad.

757
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:31.623
- You know, earlier, in
the car on the way up here.

758
00:40:32.643 --> 00:40:34.503
I'm sorry for being such a drag.

759
00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.200
That's actually nice.

760
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.940
And everyone seems to
be having a good time.

761
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.263
- That's all that matters.

762
00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.430
And it's a welcome to get
away from our usual routines.

763
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:48.543
- Yeah, it's different in a good way.

764
00:40:54.255 --> 00:40:59.172
- While I try and find
it in myself to forgive you.

765
00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.363
- Let's get this show on the row.

766
00:41:14.316 --> 00:41:15.717
- Is that you, Annette?

767
00:41:15.717 --> 00:41:17.717
But the plane was to scare them, not me.

768
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:22.200
Who are you?

769
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.400
One of Johnny's friends?

770
00:41:24.781 --> 00:41:25.950
Way to make the costume real.

771
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:27.633
Plastic knife and a camera.

772
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:29.518
What are you supposed to do?

773
00:41:29.518 --> 00:41:33.101
Just some knock off
Peeping Tom Mark Lewis.

774
00:41:34.067 --> 00:41:35.603
All right.

775
00:41:35.603 --> 00:41:37.026
Shouldn't have said anything at all.

776
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:39.299
What would you have me say?

777
00:41:39.299 --> 00:41:40.426
Come on, Sunny, think is famous.

778
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:43.650
How about, come on, Sunny.

779
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.090
Had too much to drink.

780
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:46.915
Seems more accurate.

781
00:42:06.966 --> 00:42:09.600
- Oh.

782
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.550
- Thank you.

783
00:42:12.544 --> 00:42:17.332
- Toast.

784
00:42:17.332 --> 00:42:19.500
- Are we going to that
Rockefeller event tomorrow?

785
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.543
It's in the morning.
- I hope not.

786
00:42:21.543 --> 00:42:23.760
- Ah, let's not worry about itself.

787
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.290
- I can't stand them.

788
00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.210
- They probably can't stand us.

789
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.160
- Leave it to them
to plan an event like that,

790
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.663
the day after Halloween.

791
00:42:32.004 --> 00:42:33.330
- Oh, oh!

792
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.370
This is strong.

793
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.510
No punch?

794
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:38.282
- The strangers got to it.

795
00:42:38.282 --> 00:42:39.913
- Really? All of it?

796
00:42:39.913 --> 00:42:41.730
- I got the last of it.

797
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.170
- You want me to say something?

798
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.810
- No need, I checked and
we won't be running out

799
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:47.100
of the good stuff anytime soon.

800
00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.933
- Okay.

801
00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.900
Yeah,

802
00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.150
party's officially begun.

803
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.420
- What about truth or dare?

804
00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.820
- You have all the games tonight?

805
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.650
- Well, I'm a big fan of fun.

806
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.790
- Fun, ew!

807
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.530
We never get along.

808
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.640
- Okay.

809
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.560
Truth or dare, Laurie.

810
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.200
- Truth but only because
I don't want to get out.

811
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.580
- Hmm.
- Right.

812
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.430
I'm feeling very tired all of a sudden.

813
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.151
- It is a bit of a journey to get up here.

814
00:43:16.151 --> 00:43:16.984
Isn't it?

815
00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.250
I didn't say anything

816
00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.077
but I saw the love birds
sneak into the bedroom.

817
00:43:24.863 --> 00:43:26.343
- Oh, sneaky.

818
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.470
Let them have their fun.

819
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:30.570
- Well then who is this?

820
00:43:31.624 --> 00:43:33.690
- I don't know.

821
00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.940
- You can't get us twice.

822
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.773
- What?

823
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.320
Oh, the person who dropped you off.

824
00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.520
Ah-huh.

825
00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.228
- Oh, I confess, I admit
it, I can't keep a secret.

826
00:43:49.911 --> 00:43:51.870
- Should we welcome him?

827
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.150
- Or better yet, scare him.

828
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.140
- Ah, yes.

829
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.490
He back.

830
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.870
- To who?

831
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:58.703
- To you, of course,

832
00:43:58.703 --> 00:44:00.500
but you know indirectly.

833
00:44:03.418 --> 00:44:05.168
- Okay, bye.

834
00:44:43.185 --> 00:44:46.907
- Booh!

835
00:44:47.873 --> 00:44:50.398
- Okay, well that didn't work.

836
00:44:50.398 --> 00:44:51.742
- More drinks?

837
00:44:51.742 --> 00:44:53.178
- Yes, let's.

838
00:44:53.178 --> 00:44:54.914
Would you like one?

839
00:44:54.914 --> 00:44:56.419
- Glen.

840
00:44:56.419 --> 00:44:58.831
Glen, this is Dean and Laurie,

841
00:44:58.831 --> 00:45:00.780
our other friends, Russ and Madeline.

842
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:03.303
We call her Maddy, are
around here, somewhere.

843
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.270
- Yeah. Okay, drinks.

844
00:45:19.313 --> 00:45:21.480
- Is that the dinner bell right here?

845
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:22.411
Do I need another drink?

846
00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:24.070
- Oh, you two.

847
00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:25.220
- We're on this.

848
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:31.080
- My name's Maddy and that's Russ.

849
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.179
Glad you could make it.

850
00:45:33.179 --> 00:45:34.929
- Forgot about our drinks.

851
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.700
- We need to do a photo.

852
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:39.533
Huh?

853
00:45:39.533 --> 00:45:41.100
Did you pack the camera?
- Yes.

854
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.030
- Okay

855
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.863
Go!

856
00:45:46.988 --> 00:45:49.773
- I'm gonna go help Russ.

857
00:45:51.225 --> 00:45:53.228
- Found it!
- There you are.

858
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.993
- Okay, everyone.

859
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.890
I know we're all having a grand slam

860
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.180
of a time this evening.

861
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.760
So I say we all take a group photo.

862
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.930
All of us,

863
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.850
the more the scarier as they say.

864
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:09.683
Huh?

865
00:46:11.223 --> 00:46:12.056
Oh, come on!

866
00:46:12.056 --> 00:46:13.014
Come on!

867
00:46:13.014 --> 00:46:13.847
Get up.

868
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.150
Hey, comrades.

869
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.310
No rest until dawn.

870
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:21.210
We keep going.

871
00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.063
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

872
00:46:35.721 --> 00:46:38.007
Do you know how to work this thing?

873
00:46:38.007 --> 00:46:39.457
- Oh, what about him?

874
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:41.603
- Oh, yes.

875
00:46:41.603 --> 00:46:44.250
We could take a second photo

876
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:46.710
and Annette's friend could take it.

877
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:47.790
- Glen.

878
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.290
- Yeah, Glen, what do you say?

879
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.833
Okay, I'll take that as a yes
but first you need our masks.

880
00:46:53.833 --> 00:46:54.694
We need our masks.

881
00:46:54.694 --> 00:46:55.527
Yes. Yes.

882
00:46:55.527 --> 00:46:56.370
Masks. Masks.

883
00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:57.480
Okay.

884
00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.280
On the count of three,
everyone say Monroe.

885
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.128
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

886
00:47:02.128 --> 00:47:05.238
- Monroe!

887
00:47:05.238 --> 00:47:06.843
- Okay, next.

888
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.770
- Glen, if you will do the honors,

889
00:47:31.132 --> 00:47:31.965
- Please stop.

890
00:47:31.965 --> 00:47:33.965
This is so embarrassing.

891
00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.020
- I knew it, sorry.

892
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.460
- Knew what Russ?

893
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.860
- That these two had something planned.

894
00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.790
- Like what?

895
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:43.113
- Another big scare.

896
00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.300
She told him to show it later.

897
00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.920
Not say a single word.

898
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.753
Am I right?

899
00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:50.767
- Hey Laurie!

900
00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:52.560
Laurie!

901
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.393
Wake up.

902
00:47:53.393 --> 00:47:54.630
Wake up.

903
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:55.680
Hey.
- You okay?

904
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.513
- Can you hear me?

905
00:47:56.513 --> 00:47:57.346
Look at me.

906
00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.513
- I'm sorry.

907
00:47:59.513 --> 00:48:03.069
I just, I, I think I had a
little too much to drink.

908
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:04.800
I'm just so, it's just silly.

909
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.633
I'm sorry.

910
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:06.466
- No, no, no, no.

911
00:48:06.466 --> 00:48:07.560
We've had, we've had quite a lot already.

912
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.756
Yeah.

913
00:48:08.756 --> 00:48:10.140
So we'll just switch
you over to some water

914
00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.453
and you'll be pretty
good as you in no time.

915
00:48:14.551 --> 00:48:19.359
- Oh,

916
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.192
it's me!

917
00:48:20.192 --> 00:48:21.543
Everything okay?

918
00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.300
- Yeah, it's nothing.

919
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.330
- Guy problems?

920
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:28.163
- Yeah.

921
00:48:28.163 --> 00:48:30.180
Of the strangest variety, really?

922
00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.560
- Forget about him.

923
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.670
He took the joke too far.

924
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.070
- Maybe it's better he left.

925
00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.210
How about another drink?

926
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.043
- Yeah.

927
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:45.330
- Was I right?
- About what Russ?

928
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:46.680
- That these two had something planned.

929
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.930
- Yeah, that was it.

930
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.682
Were you scared?
- Oh, I knew it.

931
00:48:50.682 --> 00:48:52.110
I knew it!

932
00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:53.820
I knew they had something planned.

933
00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.710
I'm on a roll baby.

934
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:57.480
They're gonna have to
light up Radio City Hall

935
00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:00.660
for me because this is my night.

936
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.493
Woo!

937
00:49:10.317 --> 00:49:11.467
- How is she?

938
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:14.820
- Probably just need some water.

939
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:17.570
I'm guessing she didn't eat
all day either knowing her.

940
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.690
Speaking of which, what time is it anyway?

941
00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:25.740
- After midnight?

942
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.000
Presumably.

943
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.530
- Okay, guys, could
you watch her a minute?

944
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.150
My camera's in the car.

945
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.983
Totally forgot.

946
00:49:30.983 --> 00:49:32.333
I wanted to get some footage of us while,

947
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:33.600
so that'll just be one minute.

948
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:34.433
- Take your time, Dean.

949
00:49:34.433 --> 00:49:36.140
We've got her.
- Yeah. Okay, thanks.

950
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.243
- Ah, come here!

951
00:49:43.454 --> 00:49:45.080
Where you think you're going?

952
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.037
The night is young!

953
00:49:47.037 --> 00:49:47.870
Come on!

954
00:49:50.179 --> 00:49:52.846
All right, all right, all right.

955
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.770
- Maybe we're all ready for bed,

956
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.300
I'm sure, we'll be on the
same page soon enough.

957
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.270
We could wake up early
and go for a nice walk.

958
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.943
How's that sound?
- Right now? Awful.

959
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.800
What happened to the kitchen knife?

960
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.000
- Kitchen knife?

961
00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:18.494
- Men wanted you.

962
00:50:18.494 --> 00:50:23.494
Women wanted to be you.

963
00:50:23.847 --> 00:50:26.460
They wanted to be desired.

964
00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:29.250
And some the riches or physique,

965
00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:30.817
some want it all,

966
00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.640
like Tony Curtis and Jack Lemon,

967
00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.419
dressing in drag and some like it.

968
00:50:41.534 --> 00:50:43.293
But all that can't be said aloud.

969
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.410
Sometimes silence is best.

970
00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:47.430
Sometimes less is more.

971
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.320
Sometimes we just sit
in the darkness alone

972
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.027
and no one knows we're there.

973
00:50:51.027 --> 00:50:52.650
And if they unknowingly join you,

974
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.050
it may be too late for them.

975
00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.680
And when the light comes, it'll
look like you always belong.

976
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:02.003
And they won't know what
the difference, anyway.

977
00:51:04.592 --> 00:51:07.330
You'll both just carry on like normal,

978
00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.200
like a walk in the park.

979
00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:15.603
- Aim for the stars and you
might just end up on the moon.

980
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:18.127
- That's kinda weird to hear Russ?

981
00:51:18.127 --> 00:51:20.430
- I have just experienced
the most wonderful thing

982
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:21.750
of creation.

983
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:23.430
They said it couldn't be done,

984
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:24.815
but they put a man on the moon.

985
00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.265
- I'm gonna have to cheer
all about this cruise

986
00:51:28.265 --> 00:51:30.780
and may out the middle when I get back.

987
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.030
Hey, maybe I'll even
film your description.

988
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.863
Yeah?

989
00:51:33.863 --> 00:51:35.700
- Hey, now you're thinking.

990
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:36.533
You see, sis?

991
00:51:36.533 --> 00:51:38.760
He's got all the best ideas.

992
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.380
You know, that's why it's my approval.

993
00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.680
I can overlook the fact
he's our third cousin.

994
00:51:43.651 --> 00:51:47.547
Oh.

995
00:51:47.547 --> 00:51:49.170
No, no, no, no, no.

996
00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.340
We gotta get some fresh air.

997
00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.780
We're all going outside for a walk.

998
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.860
I won't take no for an answer.

999
00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:54.915
- Yeah. Okay, okay.

1000
00:51:54.915 --> 00:51:56.640
- Hey, hey, hey.

1001
00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.550
You want my keys?

1002
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:00.903
Are you a thief, huh?

1003
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.030
- All right. Yeah.

1004
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:05.250
We need some fresh air.

1005
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.753
- If they're there when we get back,

1006
00:52:06.753 --> 00:52:08.703
then we know who the real thieves are?

1007
00:52:10.504 --> 00:52:12.628
Woo!

1008
00:52:12.628 --> 00:52:14.707
We're going on walk.

1009
00:52:14.707 --> 00:52:16.360
We're going on a long walk.

1010
00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.847
- No, we're not.

1011
00:52:17.847 --> 00:52:18.898
- Yes, we are.

1012
00:52:18.898 --> 00:52:19.731
Yes, we are!

1013
00:52:37.977 --> 00:52:39.605
- Hey, I'll catch up.

1014
00:52:39.605 --> 00:52:40.438
- Okay.

1015
00:52:40.438 --> 00:52:42.870
But hurry up cause I wanna tell
you what happened with Dean.

1016
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:44.120
- I can't wait.

1017
00:52:45.345 --> 00:52:47.460
- It is a nice night.

1018
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.293
- See?

1019
00:52:49.256 --> 00:52:51.417
- All right, you win.

1020
00:52:51.417 --> 00:52:54.390
Why don't we just call it
a leisurely night stroll

1021
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:55.713
and see how far we get.

1022
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:58.620
- What a name,

1023
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.610
an open-ended approach with
absolutely no end in sight.

1024
00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:05.460
I think they'll just
be a synergetic energy

1025
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:06.870
and we'll no to turn around.

1026
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.750
- I might just turn around if I get cold.

1027
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:11.670
- More importantly that.

1028
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.470
- What if no one else is cold?

1029
00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.500
- If one of us is cold,
then we're all cold.

1030
00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:17.333
- Here, here.

1031
00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.956
- A drowning man may grasp for the straw.

1032
00:53:20.956 --> 00:53:22.110
- And he still won't float.

1033
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:22.943
Now, will he?

1034
00:53:22.943 --> 00:53:24.540
- Good thing I can swim like a fish.

1035
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.922
- Oh, you can breathe underwater?

1036
00:53:26.922 --> 00:53:28.703
- Got me there, brother.

1037
00:53:28.703 --> 00:53:31.050
- You can drink like a fish that way.

1038
00:54:16.848 --> 00:54:18.015
- You're back.

1039
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.857
What were you doing before?

1040
00:54:24.773 --> 00:54:26.193
Why you have Dean's camera?

1041
00:54:36.666 --> 00:54:37.983
- Let me to lie down.

1042
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:20.113
- You know, when I was young,

1043
00:55:20.113 --> 00:55:23.260
I remember going to the
pictures for the first time

1044
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.400
and they kicked me out
cause I had snuck in.

1045
00:55:28.769 --> 00:55:31.703
But what they didn't know is
that I had already seen enough.

1046
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.053
Seed had been planted.

1047
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:38.913
Catherine Hepburn in that shin interest.

1048
00:55:40.854 --> 00:55:43.440
I had never seen anything like that,

1049
00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.420
never seen life portrayed in such a way

1050
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.253
that it was grander than self.

1051
00:55:48.774 --> 00:55:52.522
But that was just the beginning.

1052
00:55:52.522 --> 00:55:57.522
Marilyn, as that tank lies in.

1053
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:02.960
Luring men on and on into
their eternal destruction,

1054
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.442
that's what they said in
one of her breakout roles

1055
00:56:10.442 --> 00:56:12.275
in the movie, Niagara.

1056
00:56:14.186 --> 00:56:16.910
And they were partly telling the truth.

1057
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:20.943
It wasn't their destruction,
it was their salvation.

1058
00:56:28.164 --> 00:56:31.955
Passions that can sweep a
man to the top of the world.

1059
00:56:31.955 --> 00:56:36.788
We rage into our emotions that
not even nature can betray.

1060
00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:51.027
I was one of your six starling,
one of your six super fans

1061
00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:54.810
and I never let you down.

1062
00:57:55.881 --> 00:57:57.381
Never let me down.

1063
00:57:59.745 --> 00:58:01.618
But they did.

1064
00:58:01.618 --> 00:58:03.368
And now look at them.

1065
00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.753
- I think that was the silent
moment of understanding.

1066
01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.790
- Russ was right.

1067
01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.410
A little bit of fresh hair
was just what we needed.

1068
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.950
- I suppose that's all
that's left for the evening,

1069
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:18.513
is a song and dance number.

1070
01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:20.604
Wouldn't you agree?

1071
01:01:20.604 --> 01:01:21.437
- Oh, surely.

1072
01:01:21.437 --> 01:01:24.477
As long as it's performed
by you and only you.

1073
01:01:24.477 --> 01:01:26.700
- Oh, you gonna do me that honor?

1074
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.730
Now, I don't wanna boast but
I'd outshine you all anyway.

1075
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.890
- Oh yeah, because you know
we all afraid of stairsteps,

1076
01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.533
don't you, Russ?

1077
01:01:33.533 --> 01:01:36.615
- Is that person pounding on the door?

1078
01:01:36.615 --> 01:01:37.796
- No, whatever here.

1079
01:01:37.796 --> 01:01:40.470
The marathon of stories continues.

1080
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.483
Don't worry, we'll save you.

1081
01:02:01.675 --> 01:02:02.633
- Okay.
- Again.

1082
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.413
- Get this off.

1083
01:02:07.525 --> 01:02:09.525
- No, it's tight!

1084
01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:23.600
Go!

1085
01:02:33.703 --> 01:02:34.536
- Annette!

1086
01:02:38.746 --> 01:02:40.996
- Did you see her?

1087
01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.850
- She's not in there, she's not.

1088
01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:52.920
- Maybe she got away!

1089
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.245
She might be on the road, go!

1090
01:02:54.245 --> 01:02:56.138
- Okay.
- Let's go?

1091
01:02:56.138 --> 01:02:57.808
Come on, get in the car!

1092
01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:58.975
Russ, come on!

1093
01:03:02.681 --> 01:03:07.081
- I don't have my keys.

1094
01:03:08.515 --> 01:03:09.657
- Wait, we just have to go.

1095
01:03:09.657 --> 01:03:10.490
We have to run.

1096
01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.150
- We have to bring Annette!

1097
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:15.283
- We will keep going.
- Annette! No!

1098
01:03:15.283 --> 01:03:18.000
- Laurie, we have to go, come on!

1099
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:40.410
- We have to go back.

1100
01:03:40.410 --> 01:03:43.753
We just have to.

1101
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.810
- We'll get help.

1102
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:48.893
We'll get help.

1103
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:53.640
Hey, remember we took the whole place.

1104
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.693
She wasn't in ivory.

1105
01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:59.223
- You promise that you didn't see her?

1106
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.653
- Yeah. Yeah.

1107
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.210
The, there was a girl in the back room

1108
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.043
and it wasn't Annette.

1109
01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:09.270
There was, there's no one in the bathroom.

1110
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.110
No one in the hallway.

1111
01:04:10.110 --> 01:04:13.050
There was, there's two
people in the bedroom.

1112
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:16.001
- She wasn't in the kitchen
or the living room either.

1113
01:04:16.001 --> 01:04:19.443
- Well, well that, that's,
that's the whole place.

1114
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.083
So, so she must have gotten away.

1115
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.143
She got away, Laurie.

1116
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:27.960
- Oh, okay.

1117
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.090
Okay, so she got away.

1118
01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:32.130
- That's right, she got away.

1119
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:34.180
- So that means she's out here somewhere.

1120
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:25.103
- It's okay everyone.

1121
01:05:26.034 --> 01:05:27.663
It's all over now, isn't it?

1122
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:31.710
I would've chased them into the woods.

1123
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:36.360
But you see, I like a captive audience.

1124
01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.770
When you buy a ticket to the movie,

1125
01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:40.670
you don't have to chase the
picture to watch that, do you?

1126
01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.710
Everything has been assembled for you

1127
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:45.873
in one comfortable place.

1128
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.833
You just sit there in the
front row in the dark.

1129
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.650
Or once you've seen it over 30 times,

1130
01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:54.540
you sit in the very, very back.

1131
01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.273
Watching the others watch the movie.

1132
01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:00.480
And they don't notice
even when you get closer

1133
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.390
and closer to them as
the movie progresses,

1134
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:05.700
when you position yourself to watch,

1135
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.970
their faces light up at the lavish sets,

1136
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:10.500
their laughs at the clever quips,

1137
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.650
their tears when tragedy
strikes or romance flares,

1138
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:17.820
their awes at the
culminating required love,

1139
01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:22.260
the claps as the grand
timpani roll carries us

1140
01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.283
to the credits.

1141
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.753
But the credits always
come, don't they, my loves?

1142
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.420
And I know this has been
difficult for you all,

1143
01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.263
but now, now you can truly understand.

1144
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.290
Yes. Hello?

1145
01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:50.880
Is anyone there?

1146
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.410
Please, please.

1147
01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:53.910
We're all alone here in the woods

1148
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.860
and no one will come help us.

1149
01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.873
What has this world come to?

1150
01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.750
You need to get here right now.

1151
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.803
Where are you?

1152
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.350
You'll be hearing from our lawyers,

1153
01:07:04.350 --> 01:07:07.440
our authorities, our handlers and fixers.

1154
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.960
Someone really important
is gonna be calling you.

1155
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.343
Do you know who we are?

1156
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:14.400
You'll regret this.

1157
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.650
You'll never have another nice rest again

1158
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.600
if you don't get here in this incident.

1159
01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:21.647
I don't care, how scary it sounds.

1160
01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.883
Cowards die many times before their death.

1161
01:07:48.223 --> 01:07:50.850
- Hey, why
do we have to do it like this,

1162
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.392
called sketchy?

1163
01:07:52.392 --> 01:07:54.642
- Well, every situation's
a little different.

1164
01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:57.860
Bless, you know these families.

1165
01:08:00.161 --> 01:08:01.230
Well, I'm glad you called.

1166
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:02.780
- Well, I'm glad you picked up.

1167
01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.550
You know there were plenty
others I could have called

1168
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:06.780
before I called you.

1169
01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.420
- I, I know, I know.

1170
01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.113
Thank you.
- Yeah.

1171
01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.390
- So we're not going

1172
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.740
to one of their houses?

1173
01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:17.573
- No.

1174
01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.843
Just the ground resorts.

1175
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:24.473
- Okay.

1176
01:08:25.741 --> 01:08:26.574
- You good?

1177
01:08:27.409 --> 01:08:29.409
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

1178
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.437
- You should have to part,
you don't look good to me,

1179
01:08:34.437 --> 01:08:36.270
not the feeling you're giving off.

1180
01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.380
- I'm, I'm good though.

1181
01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.210
All right, I was just, I
was just rushed as all.

1182
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:40.590
- Hey.

1183
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:41.795
I was looking for excuses.

1184
01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:43.857
I'd ask for 'em.

1185
01:08:43.857 --> 01:08:45.030
All right.

1186
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:46.203
Just relax.

1187
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:49.740
- So what'd you do

1188
01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.960
for Halloween last night?

1189
01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.260
- I'm always on the clock.

1190
01:08:54.525 --> 01:08:57.480
- I was, I was gonna go to a party,

1191
01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:01.860
but then I, I just, I didn't.

1192
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:03.803
- So you're gonna go to
a party but you didn't.

1193
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:09.363
Speak up if you have any more
tantalizing tales to tell,

1194
01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.063
I'm all ears.

1195
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:17.310
- Hey, how is it you're
in this position anyway.

1196
01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:18.143
I mean,

1197
01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.763
how'd you get here so fast?

1198
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:26.523
- Well, son, what you
mean by this position?

1199
01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.460
Me being your superior
professionally speaking, that is.

1200
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:35.040
The pathway in this life
may possible by those

1201
01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.327
who know what they can do for you.

1202
01:09:39.129 --> 01:09:40.379
You know what that means?

1203
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.123
- I think so.

1204
01:09:43.414 --> 01:09:45.570
Wait, your dad was the police chief.

1205
01:09:45.570 --> 01:09:46.943
- Well, they should answer that.

1206
01:09:49.355 --> 01:09:51.690
I've been working with
his family for six years.

1207
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:52.533
No trust.

1208
01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:56.553
How old are you?
- I'm 21.

1209
01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:01.470
- As close to the same age I was

1210
01:10:01.470 --> 01:10:02.910
when I was in your position,

1211
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:06.750
someone was in mine, showing
me the way, vouching for me,

1212
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:07.803
opening doors for me.

1213
01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:10.107
And they don't know that I picked you up

1214
01:10:10.107 --> 01:10:11.340
and took too long away today.

1215
01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:13.020
- Wait, but you said I had-
- No, no, no, no.

1216
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.730
I'm telling you, we gonna vouch for you.

1217
01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:16.330
It's all gonna be sorted, right?

1218
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:21.110
Also, they told me that
whatever we find here,

1219
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.160
if it breathes even the
faintest air of scandal,

1220
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:25.680
they don't want the mess on their hands.

1221
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.047
They don't want their family
names or companies attached.

1222
01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:31.860
We are here just looking for our five.

1223
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.740
Anything else that we
find is not our concern.

1224
01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:37.833
And if we find anything
that involves our five,

1225
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:40.960
we try to make it not involve them.

1226
01:10:41.850 --> 01:10:42.750
Do you understand?

1227
01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.043
Hey, I need you to say yes.

1228
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:49.583
- Yeah, yeah. Yes.

1229
01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:50.450
I get it. I get it.

1230
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:53.183
- Okay.

1231
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:57.863
- Now, they're late for whatever
Rockefeller event this is.

1232
01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.240
And we were sent up here to fetch him

1233
01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.303
not just sit in here and take the scenery.

1234
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.555
All right, let's go.

1235
01:11:45.979 --> 01:11:47.947
- We should call this in.

1236
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.093
- Listen,

1237
01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:51.540
these families don't have
to worry about doing things

1238
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.963
by the book because they're
the ones that write them.

1239
01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:58.320
Just something you're
gonna have to get used to.

1240
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.837
I'd even advise you to
come to like itself.

1241
01:12:00.837 --> 01:12:03.290
You'll sleep better.

1242
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:04.443
We write the book.

1243
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.430
Who's there to tell 'em,
what's right or isn't?

1244
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.987
Not me, I'll tell you that.

1245
01:12:13.987 --> 01:12:15.870
I'm gonna go check this whole place out

1246
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.395
and we'll see what we're working with.

1247
01:12:17.395 --> 01:12:18.228
Alright?

1248
01:12:18.228 --> 01:12:19.403
You stayed behind me, okay?

1249
01:12:35.545 --> 01:12:37.485
Hey,

1250
01:12:37.485 --> 01:12:39.000
hey.

1251
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.800
We're in the clear.

1252
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.800
One back here, isn't them?

1253
01:12:49.225 --> 01:12:50.825
Hey,

1254
01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:52.158
hey, two bodies.

1255
01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:58.540
Come here.

1256
01:13:01.885 --> 01:13:06.885
Ah, no stab wounds.

1257
01:13:08.674 --> 01:13:12.212
We're in the clear though it's not done.

1258
01:13:12.212 --> 01:13:13.879
Hey, you holding up?

1259
01:13:17.429 --> 01:13:18.262
All right.

1260
01:13:25.563 --> 01:13:27.047
Nothing in here.

1261
01:13:27.047 --> 01:13:31.914
We're clear.

1262
01:13:31.914 --> 01:13:36.914
Come on.

1263
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:05.260
- Right now.

1264
01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.660
We should call it in.

1265
01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.769
- It appears so.

1266
01:14:07.769 --> 01:14:10.740
We saw anonymously.

1267
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.697
Say as little as possible.

1268
01:14:12.697 --> 01:14:13.973
- You want me to?

1269
01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:15.983
- I mean,

1270
01:14:15.983 --> 01:14:18.330
unless you want all those
that are fully expired

1271
01:14:18.330 --> 01:14:19.630
to continue sitting there.

1272
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.500
And I could tell everyone
that you just sat there

1273
01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.240
and gawked at me and
didn't do a darn thing.

1274
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.773
Yeah, I suggest you get to it.

1275
01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.740
They thought they were
headed out last night,

1276
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.390
but I knew where they were going.

1277
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:37.670
Maybe this wasn't their last stop.

1278
01:14:43.477 --> 01:14:45.180
- They are on the way.

1279
01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.140
- Good job, good job.

1280
01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.570
Not the proper channels are on the way.

1281
01:14:48.570 --> 01:14:50.880
I wanna tell you one more thing,

1282
01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.380
guy, take a look in the trunk.

1283
01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.530
Go on, get in there.

1284
01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:56.823
Don't be shy, come on.

1285
01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:00.683
Don't be shy.

1286
01:15:00.683 --> 01:15:02.417
Get in there. Take a look.

1287
01:15:04.707 --> 01:15:06.990
- No,
just, just some rags.

1288
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:08.040
A car-
- Keep looking.

1289
01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:08.873
Keep looking.

1290
01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.553
What do you see?

1291
01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:16.453
- A camera.

1292
01:15:16.453 --> 01:15:18.393
- I found it by the door outside.

1293
01:15:19.442 --> 01:15:20.423
What does that mean?

1294
01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:25.350
- I don't know what it could mean.

1295
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:26.313
It's evidence.

1296
01:15:29.429 --> 01:15:30.930
Maybe.

1297
01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:32.730
Maybe the killer was caught on here.

1298
01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.390
- Well,
there's your answer then.

1299
01:15:37.274 --> 01:15:38.846
- What?

1300
01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.243
- Oh look, there's another one.

1301
01:15:50.396 --> 01:15:51.783
Go get it.

1302
01:15:58.575 --> 01:15:59.913
Oh, Marilyn,

1303
01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:06.513
I told you, just follow my lead.

1304
01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.147
Like Marilyn Monroe once said,

1305
01:16:10.147 --> 01:16:11.670
"It's all make believe."

1306
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:12.503
Isn't it?
