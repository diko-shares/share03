00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.328
<i>In America...</i>

2
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.998
<i>...there's a burglary
every 11 seconds...</i>

3
00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:47.338
<i>...an armed robbery
every 65 seconds...</i>

4
00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.426
<i>...a violent crime
every 25 seconds...</i>

5
00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:57.515
<i>...a murder every 24 minutes...</i>

6
00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.978
<i>...and 250 rapes a day.</i>

7
00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.705
<i>Jerry, don't
push it together like that.</i>

8
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.331
Will you just let me do it?

9
00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:29.834
You make me sick!

10
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.281
Watch it!

11
00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:19.884
Hey, pal!

12
00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.135
Can I help you?

13
00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:24.138
Hey, pal...

14
00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:36.585
<i>We are willing to talk.
No one wants to hurt you.</i>

15
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.295
Do you understand?

16
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:43.509
We are willing to talk. There's
no more need for violence.

17
00:05:44.426 --> 00:05:49.014
<i>There's no way out except by
talking. Do you understand?</i>

18
00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:51.600
No one wants to hurt you.

19
00:05:52.893 --> 00:05:54.270
<i>We want to help.</i>

20
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.773
<i>Please, communicate with us.</i>

21
00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.609
- <i>We don't want to hurt you.</i>
- You can go.

22
00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.111
<i>We want to help.</i>

23
00:06:03.153 --> 00:06:04.238
You can go!

24
00:06:04.488 --> 00:06:06.031
<i>Communicate with us.</i>

25
00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.658
You're free!

26
00:06:10.786 --> 00:06:14.081
<i>No one wants to hurt you.
Do you understand?</i>

27
00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.253
Enough of trying
to deal with this maniac!

28
00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:20.629
Get down!

29
00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.008
All we need is a little more time.

30
00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:25.384
We can get control
of the situation.

31
00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:26.802
What control?

32
00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:39.523
Call the Cobra.

33
00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:36.497
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

34
00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:37.831
Any I.D. on the guy?

35
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.084
Just another asshole who woke up
hating the world.

36
00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:41.377
What's happening?

37
00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:43.796
I don't agree
with them bringing you here.

38
00:07:44.254 --> 00:07:45.547
I just want you to know that.

39
00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:48.175
Yeah

40
00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:49.635
Come on.

41
00:07:50.886 --> 00:07:51.804
Come on!

42
00:07:53.597 --> 00:07:54.556
Move!

43
00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:09.488
<i>Shut up, man!</i>

44
00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:11.907
<i>Relax!</i>

45
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:15.285
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

46
00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:19.164
Shh.

47
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.014
<i>Bitch, come on!</i>

48
00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:38.434
<i>I'll blow your
stupid head off. Get over there!</i>

49
00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:44.440
Get down, you.
Get down there, man.

50
00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:46.400
Shut up!
You get away from her!

51
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:48.444
<i>Shut up!</i>

52
00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:08.297
I'll kill you, man.
I'll kill them all!

53
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.091
<i>It's the way of the New World.</i>

54
00:09:11.425 --> 00:09:13.635
<i>So where are those TV cameras?</i>

55
00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:17.139
Hey, man, I've got a bomb here.

56
00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:19.683
<i>I'll kill them all!</i>

57
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:23.562
<i>You bring in the TV,
or I'll kill them all.</i>

58
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.397
<i>You understand?</i>

59
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.067
<i>It's the way of the New World!</i>

60
00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:44.792
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

61
00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:49.338
<i>Come on over here, I'll
kill them. You got that?</i>

62
00:09:50.297 --> 00:09:52.883
<i>You're all trash, anyway.
You all deserve it.</i>

63
00:09:55.886 --> 00:09:57.513
<i>You're gonna die right now,
you got that?</i>

64
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.098
<i>Watch this, I'm gonna kill her.</i>

65
00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:03.811
<i>I'm gonna
incinerate the kitchen!</i>

66
00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:07.856
<i>Hey, dirtbag!</i>

67
00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:10.818
<i>You're a lousy shot.</i>

68
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:13.821
<i>I don't like lousy shots.</i>

69
00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:17.449
<i>You wasted a kid for nothing.</i>

70
00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:20.828
<i>Now I think it's time
to waste you.</i>

71
00:10:28.877 --> 00:10:30.129
Hold it!

72
00:10:30.754 --> 00:10:31.880
<i>Come on, man.</i>

73
00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:33.841
I got a bomb here.

74
00:10:34.508 --> 00:10:35.467
I'll kill her.

75
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.678
I'll blow this whole place up.

76
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.221
Go ahead.

77
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.390
I don't shop here.

78
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.689
Just relax, amigo.

79
00:10:49.106 --> 00:10:50.232
You want to talk?

80
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.944
We'll talk. I'm a sucker
for good conversation.

81
00:10:54.528 --> 00:10:55.654
I don't want to talk to you.

82
00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:58.073
You bring the television
cameras in here now.

83
00:10:58.574 --> 00:10:59.700
Come on, bring it in!

84
00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.244
I can't do that.

85
00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:03.620
Why?

86
00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:08.208
I don't deal with psychos.
I put them away.

87
00:11:08.417 --> 00:11:09.835
I ain't no psycho, man.

88
00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:11.712
I'm a hero!

89
00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:14.256
You're looking at
a fucking hunter.

90
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.675
I'm a hero of the New World.

91
00:11:18.218 --> 00:11:20.888
You're a disease,
and I'm the cure.

92
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:23.390
Die!

93
00:11:24.099 --> 00:11:24.766
Hey!

94
00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:27.144
<i>Drop it!</i>

95
00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:58.842
Come on.

96
00:12:08.185 --> 00:12:09.478
- You okay, man?
- Yeah.

97
00:12:10.646 --> 00:12:11.980
Please, people, please.

98
00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.941
You're the one
who killed the maniac?

99
00:12:14.566 --> 00:12:15.651
Did he say why he did it?

100
00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.277
Is it related
to the Night Slasher?

101
00:12:17.527 --> 00:12:19.196
The Night Slasher is
an entirely different case.

102
00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:20.197
Now, please, people, please!

103
00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:21.823
Let's have a little room!

104
00:12:22.157 --> 00:12:23.283
<i>Was it necessary--?</i>

105
00:12:23.659 --> 00:12:24.743
<i>That's right,
I asked a question.</i>

106
00:12:24.993 --> 00:12:26.828
<i>Was it necessary for it
to end like this?</i>

107
00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:28.664
Did he have to die?

108
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.040
Come on,
don't listen to this asshole.

109
00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.625
<i>The question is, Cobretti,</i>

110
00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:33.961
<i>did you use
unnecessary deadly force?</i>

111
00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:35.796
I used everything I had.

112
00:12:36.213 --> 00:12:38.507
Is this a public forum? Come on!
We have work to do out here!

113
00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.467
<i>Our viewers have the
right to know what makes a policeman</i>

114
00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.135
a judge and jury.
People have rights.

115
00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:43.262
<i>Rights?</i>

116
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.555
You think a maniac who blew
a kid's heart out for nothing

117
00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:46.556
should have rights?

118
00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.684
That doesn't concern you
and no matter what you think,

119
00:12:48.892 --> 00:12:51.270
<i>people are entitled
to protection by the law.</i>

120
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:56.984
You tell that to his family!

121
00:13:02.322 --> 00:13:04.741
All right, the show's over.
Come on, clear this area!

122
00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:23.010
- Move it!
- Fuck you!

123
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.103
What's your problem?

124
00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:47.534
What's your <i>problema, ése?</i>
You touched my car, man.

125
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.041
That's bad for your health.

126
00:13:54.291 --> 00:13:56.293
What is, <i>pinche?</i>

127
00:13:58.503 --> 00:13:59.588
Me.

128
00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:04.801
Clean up your act.

129
00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.727
<i>Yeah! You're in trouble, man.</i>

130
00:14:14.394 --> 00:14:16.063
You told him, <i>ése.</i>

131
00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:17.439
Yeah, all right.

132
00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:54.619
<i>Tonight, the man known</i>

133
00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:56.163
<i>as the Night Slasher...</i>

134
00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:00.167
<i>...has struck for the 16th time
in just over a month's time.</i>

135
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:01.460
<i>The 22-year-old victim</i>

136
00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:03.753
<i>was mutilated with
a sharp instrument...</i>

137
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.465
<i>...and seemed to be just as
unlikely a victim</i>

138
00:16:06.673 --> 00:16:07.924
<i>as the other 15.</i>

139
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.718
<i>Not much else
is known other than</i>

140
00:16:09.926 --> 00:16:12.512
<i>that the Night Slasher
preys upon anyone.</i>

141
00:16:12.762 --> 00:16:14.514
<i>Victims have included
businessmen,</i>

142
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:15.765
<i>Asian immigrants...</i>

143
00:16:15.932 --> 00:16:19.936
<i>...the elderly and, in one case,
a sexually assaulted child.</i>

144
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.106
<i>The serial killer has thrown
the city into a growing panic...</i>

145
00:16:23.398 --> 00:16:27.527
<i>...and up until now, no one
has had a clue to his identity.</i>

146
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:31.281
<i>The killer has been known
to crawl through windows...</i>

147
00:16:31.531 --> 00:16:33.617
<i>...and kill the victims
in their sleep.</i>

148
00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:36.703
<i>The method of death has been
silent instruments...</i>

149
00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.414
<i>...such as claw hammers,
knives and axes.</i>

150
00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.698
<i>There's no question
it's the same weapon.</i>

151
00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.658
<i>90% sure
it's the same weapon.</i>

152
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.035
Cuts are
straight, long, deep,

153
00:17:59.244 --> 00:17:59.995
<i>just like the others.</i>

154
00:18:00.203 --> 00:18:01.329
That brings
the count to 16,

155
00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:03.290
and still this bastard
shows no distinct pattern.

156
00:18:03.623 --> 00:18:05.208
Maybe there's more than one.

157
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.669
Look, this is not
your specialty, okay?

158
00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:10.005
<i>This is pure
investigative work...</i>

159
00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.548
<i>...not jumping out a window.</i>

160
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:13.842
We need
to beef up the task force.

161
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.719
We need
interagency cooperation.

162
00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:18.680
Christ, every department wants
to be the hero in this case!

163
00:18:18.888 --> 00:18:20.390
Captain, look,
I don't want to be a hero.

164
00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.350
I just want to get involved.

165
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:28.607
<i>If I may, captain...?</i>

166
00:18:29.232 --> 00:18:30.734
If we let Cobretti
use his tactics,

167
00:18:30.942 --> 00:18:32.027
we're asking for trouble.

168
00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:33.570
What are you saying?

169
00:18:33.903 --> 00:18:35.947
He should stay
on the zombie squad.

170
00:18:36.197 --> 00:18:37.657
You're
telling me where to stay?

171
00:18:37.907 --> 00:18:39.075
It's nothing personal.

172
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.827
We're just different
kinds of cops.

173
00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:42.120
Like Monte says,

174
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.914
you're a specialist
who does a job nobody wants.

175
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:46.583
But we can't shake people down.

176
00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:48.376
Internal Affairs
will jump on us.

177
00:18:48.668 --> 00:18:50.337
- Then we lost.
- Lost?

178
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.006
As long as we play
by these bullshit rules

179
00:18:53.214 --> 00:18:54.966
and the killer doesn't, we lose.

180
00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:58.595
<i>Yes, sir, we'll
send a squad car right out.</i>

181
00:19:07.145 --> 00:19:08.521
What do you want to do?

182
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.398
Nothing
we can do, except wait.

183
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.775
For what?

184
00:19:12.525 --> 00:19:14.569
For it to happen again.

185
00:19:51.022 --> 00:19:52.482
I'm, like, really sorry.

186
00:19:52.691 --> 00:19:54.317
Do you think there's,
like, any damage?

187
00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:56.194
How could you have hit me?

188
00:19:56.403 --> 00:19:57.904
Have you been
drinking or something?

189
00:19:58.655 --> 00:19:59.572
Yes.

190
00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:43.533
Get the license plate!

191
00:20:49.164 --> 00:20:50.415
Come on, come on!

192
00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:10.894
He's daring us to catch him.

193
00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:12.979
We dig in and find that lead.

194
00:21:13.188 --> 00:21:14.105
Forget it.

195
00:21:14.314 --> 00:21:16.316
Forget it?
What options do we have?

196
00:21:16.608 --> 00:21:17.859
Call the bastard.

197
00:21:22.405 --> 00:21:24.324
<i>Metro Police. Can I help you?</i>

198
00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:29.078
<i>Yes, ma'am,
I need your location.</i>

199
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.332
<i>Ma'am, would you
just be calm...</i>

200
00:21:53.144 --> 00:21:54.062
Gentlemen.

201
00:21:54.687 --> 00:21:55.939
Captain.

202
00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:58.107
I won't waste any time.

203
00:21:58.608 --> 00:22:01.986
You know almost every sicko
in this city. Shake them down.

204
00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:04.197
Do what you have to do
to get a lead on this maniac.

205
00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:05.782
If I find him?

206
00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.408
Do what you do best.

207
00:22:08.993 --> 00:22:10.787
And try not to waste
the wrong guy.

208
00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:12.705
<i>But then again...</i>

209
00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:15.750
...what do you care, right?

210
00:22:19.254 --> 00:22:20.797
<i>You know, when this is over...</i>

211
00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:22.632
...I'd like to celebrate

212
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.969
by punching a hole
in Monte's chest.

213
00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.390
You know what the trouble
with you is?

214
00:22:32.725 --> 00:22:34.185
You're too violent.

215
00:22:35.103 --> 00:22:35.895
Me?

216
00:22:36.771 --> 00:22:37.981
It's all that sugar you eat.

217
00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:41.401
- This is the first sugar today.
- It's that junk food.

218
00:22:41.693 --> 00:22:42.569
Bullshit!

219
00:22:42.902 --> 00:22:45.488
Try prunes, something natural.
Raisins.

220
00:22:46.364 --> 00:22:49.075
<i>Try fish.
Fish and rice. Very good.</i>

221
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:51.744
Fish and rice!

222
00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.321
- I'll take it from here.
- Sure?

223
00:26:13.696 --> 00:26:15.323
No problem.
Her car's right over there.

224
00:26:16.324 --> 00:26:17.700
You're in good hands.
Good night.

225
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.119
Listen, I still think
if you wanted to,

226
00:26:20.286 --> 00:26:22.497
you could be doing
a lot bigger layouts.

227
00:26:22.705 --> 00:26:25.041
I mean it's up to you,
but I could help.

228
00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:27.543
I don't want to have
to play these games.

229
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.922
- Games? What games?
- You know what games!

230
00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:34.008
Look, I'd be sick not to want
to sleep with you.

231
00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.220
Then don't do it for me.
Do it for your career.

232
00:26:39.597 --> 00:26:41.057
Did you hear something?

233
00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:45.728
It's not like I'm
asking you to marry me.

234
00:26:56.572 --> 00:26:59.492
I see it will take time
to make you change your mind.

235
00:26:59.659 --> 00:27:01.452
So where do you
want to eat?

236
00:27:01.702 --> 00:27:04.038
Please, Dan,
I'm not hungry!

237
00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:06.499
Look-- I'm not doing
this for me, really.

238
00:27:06.666 --> 00:27:10.586
Look, I'm just trying
to help you find happiness.

239
00:27:11.045 --> 00:27:13.047
Damn. I forgot my bag.

240
00:27:14.132 --> 00:27:16.092
You see?
You do need me.

241
00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:17.927
Dan!

242
00:27:18.094 --> 00:27:19.220
Oh, my God!

243
00:27:38.781 --> 00:27:41.367
Please! Come on!
My God!

244
00:27:42.618 --> 00:27:45.246
Please, please!

245
00:27:47.248 --> 00:27:48.624
Leave me alone!

246
00:27:49.542 --> 00:27:50.710
They're trying to kill me!

247
00:27:50.918 --> 00:27:52.420
Get back, get back!

248
00:27:57.216 --> 00:27:58.718
Kill her.

249
00:29:11.832 --> 00:29:13.542
<i>Doctor Dorson, please call</i>

250
00:29:13.709 --> 00:29:16.003
<i>nurses' station four West.</i>

251
00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.964
How long before that kicks in?

252
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.590
I don't want to sleep.

253
00:29:19.882 --> 00:29:20.841
It won't make you sleep.

254
00:29:21.008 --> 00:29:22.551
It will just calm you down.

255
00:29:23.594 --> 00:29:25.972
Now, I'll be back
when you're finished.

256
00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:29.684
Hi.

257
00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:34.021
- Is it "Ka-nudsen"? Ka?
- Mm-hm.

258
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.190
That's what I thought.

259
00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.152
I am Sergeant Gonzales...

260
00:29:40.486 --> 00:29:41.988
...and that intense-looking
gentleman

261
00:29:42.154 --> 00:29:44.824
behind you is
Lieutenant Cobretti.

262
00:29:45.324 --> 00:29:47.410
We're a pair of
really nice guys...

263
00:29:47.618 --> 00:29:49.870
...who are here to ask you
a lot of bad questions.

264
00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:51.914
Is that all right?

265
00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:57.545
You don't look like policemen.

266
00:29:58.546 --> 00:29:59.338
No?

267
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.425
You're kidding?
She must mean you.

268
00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:05.845
No, we are.
We're the real thing.

269
00:30:07.513 --> 00:30:10.182
I don't understand
how this happened to me.

270
00:30:11.475 --> 00:30:14.645
Why don't you take a minute?
Think about it.

271
00:30:16.939 --> 00:30:18.357
Did you have a fight
with anyone?

272
00:30:18.524 --> 00:30:19.191
No.

273
00:30:19.483 --> 00:30:21.944
- You owe money to anybody?
- No.

274
00:30:22.194 --> 00:30:24.572
You been around drugs,
people who deal drugs?

275
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:27.074
Never. No.

276
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:30.494
That's nice.

277
00:30:33.164 --> 00:30:34.332
So in other words
in the last few weeks,

278
00:30:34.498 --> 00:30:35.916
there hasn't been anything?
Like no threatening calls?

279
00:30:36.709 --> 00:30:38.085
No threats of any kind?

280
00:30:38.836 --> 00:30:39.920
No.

281
00:30:40.796 --> 00:30:43.883
There was this guy who
scared me a little tonight.

282
00:30:45.092 --> 00:30:46.093
Who?

283
00:30:47.762 --> 00:30:49.597
I don't know who he was.

284
00:30:50.514 --> 00:30:52.683
Some guy broke down
by the underpass.

285
00:30:52.892 --> 00:30:54.435
I just drove away.

286
00:30:56.937 --> 00:30:58.397
What time were you there?

287
00:31:00.232 --> 00:31:01.776
Maybe 10:00.

288
00:31:02.526 --> 00:31:04.820
He scared you. Why?
What was he doing?

289
00:31:05.988 --> 00:31:08.240
It was just the way
he looked at me.

290
00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:11.494
What else did you see?
Did you see anything else?

291
00:31:11.952 --> 00:31:15.414
Yeah, there was another car
in front of them.

292
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:18.292
Them?

293
00:31:20.127 --> 00:31:21.921
I think there was three of them.

294
00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:23.798
You think you would
recognize him

295
00:31:23.964 --> 00:31:25.257
if you saw him again?

296
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:27.051
The tall one?

297
00:31:27.426 --> 00:31:30.262
Yeah, the one that
wants to kill you.

298
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:57.039
She knows your face.

299
00:31:57.873 --> 00:31:59.500
I know where she is.

300
00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:07.591
Let me get her for you.

301
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.558
She's mine.

302
00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:22.022
- You done, Fred?
- Yeah.

303
00:32:23.065 --> 00:32:24.066
Cute guy.

304
00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.236
So, what do you think?

305
00:32:28.362 --> 00:32:29.989
It looks a little like him.

306
00:32:30.364 --> 00:32:32.408
You can't describe
the other two, right?

307
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.994
No, it was too dark.

308
00:32:35.327 --> 00:32:36.579
Want to run prints
at headquarters?

309
00:32:36.745 --> 00:32:38.873
No, no, I'll take
care of it. Thanks.

310
00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:40.124
Tonight, you'll stay here.

311
00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.751
Tomorrow, we'll move you
to a safe house, okay?

312
00:32:43.252 --> 00:32:45.546
Why do I have to stay
around this? I want to go.

313
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.507
You're the one who can place him
at the crime scene.

314
00:32:48.757 --> 00:32:51.010
Until we get him,
it's got to be that way.

315
00:32:54.972 --> 00:32:56.140
Tony, you hungry?

316
00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:57.600
What do you got?

317
00:32:58.184 --> 00:33:00.269
I got something that
looks like cheese.

318
00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.438
No, there's
some cake over there.

319
00:33:02.688 --> 00:33:03.522
Take the cheese.

320
00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:05.024
I don't want
the cheese.

321
00:33:05.357 --> 00:33:06.400
I saw some cake.

322
00:33:07.026 --> 00:33:08.194
You're done with this,
aren't you?

323
00:33:08.527 --> 00:33:09.320
Yes.

324
00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:13.365
All right, take the cake.
But save it, okay?

325
00:33:13.699 --> 00:33:15.534
Let me have a
little bite of that.

326
00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:19.079
- I'm not your butler, okay?
- Come on, don't pout.

327
00:33:29.256 --> 00:33:31.717
She's going to wreck our
New World.

328
00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:33.552
And the dream.

329
00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:36.555
You have to stop her.

330
00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:44.563
Great-looking guy, huh?

331
00:33:45.272 --> 00:33:46.690
Do you have that upside-down?

332
00:33:47.441 --> 00:33:49.777
No, he's just a regular dirtbag.

333
00:33:50.027 --> 00:33:51.654
I want to go to my place

334
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.197
and check this out
against my files.

335
00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:54.865
I'll be back in a couple
of hours, okay?

336
00:33:55.032 --> 00:33:55.699
Right.

337
00:33:55.866 --> 00:33:57.159
There's a real
nice-looking lady, huh?

338
00:33:57.326 --> 00:33:58.410
Wasn't she?

339
00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:01.664
- The one upstairs?
- The one upstairs. You remember?

340
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.375
I didn't notice, Gonzales.
I was on the job.

341
00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:05.751
I was paying attention
to business.

342
00:34:05.918 --> 00:34:07.378
Me too. I didn't notice.

343
00:34:07.586 --> 00:34:08.754
- Good night, all right?
- Yeah.

344
00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:10.089
Fucking liar!

345
00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:11.590
Watch your mouth.
You're in public.

346
00:34:11.757 --> 00:34:12.716
Of course.

347
00:34:41.453 --> 00:34:42.621
You're a good citizen.

348
00:35:48.854 --> 00:35:49.897
<i>Break back to Carter,</i>

349
00:35:50.064 --> 00:35:51.273
<i>and he's stopped!</i>

350
00:35:57.613 --> 00:35:59.782
You can't buy a damn thing
that's worth a--

351
00:36:19.385 --> 00:36:22.054
You men are supposed
to use the service elevator.

352
00:36:22.304 --> 00:36:24.348
Next time, use the stairs.

353
00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:54.545
Remember the health code.
Next time take the stairs.

354
00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:18.819
A little late to be mopping up.

355
00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.948
You want me to say something?

356
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:26.785
No, I've got to do my rounds.
I'll tell him.

357
00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:28.537
See you next break.

358
00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:51.560
Yeah?

359
00:37:51.852 --> 00:37:54.688
Hey, I'm in your office.
What do you need me for?

360
00:37:55.022 --> 00:37:55.898
Why are you there?

361
00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:58.233
Headquarters said
you wanted me here.

362
00:37:58.567 --> 00:37:59.985
Get back to the hospital!

363
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:02.154
Presley!

364
00:38:31.975 --> 00:38:32.851
Hey!

365
00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:35.098
Pretty hair!

366
00:41:31.613 --> 00:41:33.865
Why are you doing this to me?

367
00:41:36.618 --> 00:41:38.870
Stop this right now!
Stop doing this to me!

368
00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.721
Is anybody here?

369
00:42:07.315 --> 00:42:09.860
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

370
00:42:10.152 --> 00:42:13.613
<i>All exits from the hospital
are clearly marked.</i>

371
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:18.702
<i>Please use the stairs and
proceed in an orderly manner.</i>

372
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.579
<i>Do not run.</i>

373
00:42:21.204 --> 00:42:23.665
<i>Do not use the elevators.</i>

374
00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.126
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

375
00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.921
<i>All exits from the hospital
are clearly marked.</i>

376
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:34.718
<i>Please use the stairs and
proceed in an orderly manner.</i>

377
00:42:35.594 --> 00:42:37.262
<i>Do not run.</i>

378
00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:39.598
<i>Do not use the elevators.</i>

379
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:42.893
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

380
00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:45.020
<i>You almost got everyone killed.</i>

381
00:42:45.395 --> 00:42:48.774
- Now maybe you'll do it right.
- They've got somebody inside.

382
00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.776
Smart accusation, Cobretti.

383
00:42:50.942 --> 00:42:53.195
Can you prove it? Huh?

384
00:42:53.487 --> 00:42:55.530
Chief Halliwell wants an answer.

385
00:42:56.531 --> 00:42:57.365
Not yet.

386
00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.493
I understand what
we're dealing with.

387
00:42:59.701 --> 00:43:01.787
Don't make things
harder than they are.

388
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.122
Monte says you've got
a sketch of the suspect.

389
00:43:04.372 --> 00:43:05.916
Is this a game?

390
00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:08.710
He didn't say the magic word.

391
00:43:09.002 --> 00:43:10.128
What magic word?

392
00:43:10.837 --> 00:43:12.089
Please.

393
00:43:15.258 --> 00:43:16.593
All right,
enough of this bullshit.

394
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.053
Do you understand?

395
00:43:19.304 --> 00:43:20.347
You bet.

396
00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:23.266
That's it?

397
00:43:24.726 --> 00:43:25.685
That's it.

398
00:43:30.565 --> 00:43:34.152
Cobretti, do you know
you have an attitude problem?

399
00:43:36.446 --> 00:43:38.615
Yeah, but it's
just a little one.

400
00:43:49.751 --> 00:43:52.671
- He's going to get me, isn't he?
- No, he won't.

401
00:43:52.879 --> 00:43:56.383
How can you say that?
You said I'll be safe here.

402
00:43:58.552 --> 00:43:59.719
Who is he?

403
00:44:00.554 --> 00:44:02.180
We don't know yet.

404
00:44:03.932 --> 00:44:05.934
- Come on, it's moving time.
- All right.

405
00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:08.937
This is Officer Stalk.
She's assigned to this case.

406
00:44:09.146 --> 00:44:10.689
- So let's go, guys.
- Where?

407
00:44:11.064 --> 00:44:12.691
We're going to a safe house.

408
00:44:12.941 --> 00:44:14.317
Want help with this?

409
00:44:15.277 --> 00:44:16.862
- Want a bite?
- No.

410
00:44:17.404 --> 00:44:19.072
Don't you like health food??

411
00:44:21.908 --> 00:44:24.077
Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary?

412
00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:26.705
Did anybody challenge you?

413
00:44:28.498 --> 00:44:30.458
If you remember anything,
let us know.

414
00:44:30.625 --> 00:44:32.002
I appreciate your help.

415
00:44:32.335 --> 00:44:34.212
You've got to tell me
what happened here.

416
00:44:34.629 --> 00:44:37.632
I told you to let my team
handle this, understand?

417
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:40.635
Of course you don't.
Listen, hotshot.

418
00:44:40.927 --> 00:44:42.387
We want him
as much as you do.

419
00:44:42.554 --> 00:44:43.388
Do you?

420
00:44:43.638 --> 00:44:45.515
There were three men
assigned to that room.

421
00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.934
Headquarters called
to take two off. Why?

422
00:44:48.643 --> 00:44:50.562
Headquarters didn't do anything.

423
00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:52.856
No? Then who did?

424
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:55.650
It's your show.
You find out.

425
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.611
<i>Please call operator three.</i>

426
00:46:13.979 --> 00:46:15.146
Where's Gonzales?

427
00:46:20.026 --> 00:46:21.152
Buckle up!

428
00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:24.841
Hold on!

429
00:47:44.152 --> 00:47:46.488
He's crazy! He's crazy!

430
00:48:41.751 --> 00:48:42.627
Go!

431
00:48:53.263 --> 00:48:54.389
Watch out!

432
00:49:54.407 --> 00:49:55.617
Oh, my God!

433
00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:03.082
Get down!

434
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.426
It's so out of control.

435
00:50:55.593 --> 00:50:56.469
Where do I start?

436
00:50:56.678 --> 00:50:58.012
With the legal problems.

437
00:50:58.221 --> 00:50:59.722
Of course
we have legal problems.

438
00:50:59.889 --> 00:51:02.016
The city's one big battlefield.

439
00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:05.979
The public will be screaming
for federal assistance.

440
00:51:06.145 --> 00:51:07.188
I don't want FBI in here!

441
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.399
We've got
the manpower to handle it,

442
00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:11.359
so why can't we control this?

443
00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:14.696
Because we're not up against one man
we're up against an army of killers.

444
00:51:14.904 --> 00:51:15.655
I keep telling you guys that.

445
00:51:15.863 --> 00:51:17.949
- How do you know?
- I know, all right?

446
00:51:18.157 --> 00:51:19.993
This army
theory sounds weak.

447
00:51:20.159 --> 00:51:21.536
Does it really?

448
00:51:21.786 --> 00:51:23.079
What have you got,

449
00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:25.498
besides a scared woman,
to back up what you say?

450
00:51:25.748 --> 00:51:27.625
And your idea of taking her
out of the city

451
00:51:27.792 --> 00:51:30.044
for protection is ridiculous.

452
00:51:30.211 --> 00:51:32.005
- Is it?
- The security is here.

453
00:51:32.213 --> 00:51:35.049
Maybe she'll be safer here,
where we can keep an eye on her.

454
00:51:35.717 --> 00:51:37.135
- It won't work.
- Why not?

455
00:51:37.468 --> 00:51:40.388
We're dealing with fanatics
who'll do anything to waste her!

456
00:51:40.722 --> 00:51:43.141
Excuse me, but I've got
to say what I think.

457
00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:46.561
And I think this whole
sorry ordeal is like some...

458
00:51:46.769 --> 00:51:48.980
...damn sick joke,
if you ask me.

459
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.565
Nobody asked you, Monte.

460
00:51:50.857 --> 00:51:52.567
That's just too bad, isn't it?

461
00:51:52.817 --> 00:51:55.361
He doesn't give a
rat's ass for this girl.

462
00:51:55.528 --> 00:51:56.946
She's just live bait...

463
00:51:57.196 --> 00:51:59.032
...so King Cobretti here
can cut a new notch.

464
00:51:59.365 --> 00:52:01.659
You've already caused
a lot of people to die.

465
00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:03.911
How about letting her live?

466
00:52:06.372 --> 00:52:07.624
Enough!

467
00:52:16.424 --> 00:52:17.675
Next time.

468
00:52:18.426 --> 00:52:19.927
He's the psycho!

469
00:52:20.094 --> 00:52:21.095
What do we want to do?

470
00:52:21.971 --> 00:52:24.932
If he thinks those psychos
will follow her, let him go.

471
00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:27.685
At least we got them
out of the city.

472
00:52:28.061 --> 00:52:29.437
- You all right?
- Yeah.

473
00:53:02.929 --> 00:53:04.430
Are your men out there?

474
00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:05.973
Yeah, they're out there.

475
00:53:07.141 --> 00:53:08.643
Are we just supposed
to drive around

476
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.436
until he tries to kill us again?

477
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.897
No, they won't get you.

478
00:53:13.314 --> 00:53:16.442
You keep saying that.
How do you know that for sure?

479
00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:19.696
You got to have faith.

480
00:53:50.852 --> 00:53:52.145
Can I ask you something?

481
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.855
Sure, what's that?

482
00:53:54.105 --> 00:53:56.524
Why were you fighting
with the other police?

483
00:53:56.774 --> 00:54:00.778
Sometimes they don't
buy what I believe.

484
00:54:01.654 --> 00:54:04.031
There's all these
crazy people everywhere.

485
00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:05.908
Why can't the police
just put them away

486
00:54:06.075 --> 00:54:07.285
and keep them away?

487
00:54:08.327 --> 00:54:10.204
Hey, tell it to the judge.

488
00:54:10.496 --> 00:54:11.581
What do you mean?

489
00:54:12.206 --> 00:54:13.875
We put them away.
They let them out.

490
00:54:15.626 --> 00:54:17.378
It makes me sick!

491
00:54:18.921 --> 00:54:21.716
Like I said, you got to
tell it to the judge.

492
00:54:34.479 --> 00:54:36.355
Great day for junk food, babe.

493
00:54:37.106 --> 00:54:39.233
Why don't you add
meat to your diet?

494
00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:42.445
No, thanks. I hate frog legs.

495
00:54:47.825 --> 00:54:48.618
Hi.

496
00:54:48.951 --> 00:54:49.827
Hey.

497
00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:51.662
You want?

498
00:54:52.288 --> 00:54:53.581
Thank you.

499
00:54:53.956 --> 00:54:55.249
Fellow garbage-belly.

500
00:55:02.256 --> 00:55:03.466
So how you doing?

501
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.092
All right. What about you?

502
00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.052
Not bad.

503
00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:09.847
Where are we going?

504
00:55:10.139 --> 00:55:11.682
You're going to have
to ask Cobra.

505
00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:13.768
He's the expert on this.

506
00:55:15.019 --> 00:55:17.396
He doesn't look like an expert,
does he?

507
00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:20.817
I know. He looks like
a fugitive from the '50s...

508
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.653
...but he sure is great
at catching psychos.

509
00:55:23.986 --> 00:55:26.155
He's the pride of the
zombie squad.

510
00:55:27.031 --> 00:55:28.324
What's the zombie squad?

511
00:55:28.783 --> 00:55:30.451
The bottom line.

512
00:55:31.869 --> 00:55:33.079
Want to have some fun?

513
00:55:34.205 --> 00:55:35.665
It's kind of personal...

514
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.084
...but it might cheer him up.

515
00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.127
Walk up to him...

516
00:55:40.711 --> 00:55:42.171
...and call him...

517
00:55:44.006 --> 00:55:45.258
He likes that.

518
00:55:52.431 --> 00:55:53.432
Hot item.

519
00:55:54.934 --> 00:55:56.936
Did you find out anything new?

520
00:55:57.311 --> 00:56:00.189
Since you were in the bathroom?
No, not really.

521
00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:01.649
I did.

522
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:03.234
Like what?

523
00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:05.111
Marion Cobretti.

524
00:56:06.028 --> 00:56:07.822
Is that really your name?

525
00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:10.867
Gonzales talks too much,
doesn't he?

526
00:56:12.243 --> 00:56:14.328
- It's not so bad.
- No?

527
00:56:16.163 --> 00:56:18.165
It's kind of tough
growing up with.

528
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:21.627
- I like it. Yeah.
- Do you?

529
00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.338
I always wanted to have
a tougher one myself.

530
00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.340
You know, a little harder name.

531
00:56:26.507 --> 00:56:27.800
Like what?

532
00:56:28.968 --> 00:56:29.844
Alice.

533
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:34.974
We'd better get going.

534
00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:38.936
Sorry, no sale.

535
00:57:40.539 --> 00:57:42.333
Your entrée is ready.

536
00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.920
It's for the large family.

537
00:57:46.128 --> 00:57:47.546
It sure is.

538
00:58:02.395 --> 00:58:03.729
You have a life preserver?

539
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:05.398
Why?

540
00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:08.025
Because your French fries
are drowning there.

541
00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:13.322
What is this place?

542
00:58:14.323 --> 00:58:16.075
It's a foundry town.

543
00:58:18.703 --> 00:58:20.037
Tell me something:

544
00:58:20.371 --> 00:58:21.539
Do you ever let go?

545
00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:24.250
Sure.

546
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:26.127
Really?

547
00:58:26.961 --> 00:58:28.754
So what do you do to relax?

548
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.589
Look for trouble.

549
00:58:31.924 --> 00:58:32.800
No, I mean...

550
00:58:33.175 --> 00:58:34.802
...do you ever get involved?

551
00:58:35.636 --> 00:58:36.887
With a woman?

552
00:58:37.346 --> 00:58:38.973
Yeah, a woman.

553
00:58:39.348 --> 00:58:41.475
A real woman?
A real live woman?

554
00:58:41.767 --> 00:58:44.478
I don't know.
Now and then. Nothing regular.

555
00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:45.938
Why?

556
00:58:46.647 --> 00:58:48.566
Let's just say that...

557
00:58:50.234 --> 00:58:53.070
...not many people could
put up with the way I live.

558
00:58:53.988 --> 00:58:55.781
What if you found one?

559
00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:00.786
I'd say she'd have to be
a little crazy.

560
01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:09.855
I've got to go.

561
01:00:14.985 --> 01:00:16.195
You scared me.

562
01:00:16.987 --> 01:00:18.155
Where's Tony?

563
01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:21.992
Uh, he's asleep. I was just
checking on things at home.

564
01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:25.037
Why not use the phone
in your room?

565
01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:26.580
Uh, it's out of order.

566
01:00:26.872 --> 01:00:28.165
It's getting cold out here, huh?

567
01:00:28.332 --> 01:00:30.501
Yeah. Better get inside.

568
01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:33.546
Maybe it doesn't mean much,

569
01:00:33.712 --> 01:00:35.756
but I think you're doing
a great job.

570
01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.049
You too.

571
01:01:56.253 --> 01:01:57.796
Can't you sleep?

572
01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:00.007
Not really.

573
01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:02.801
You should try.

574
01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:11.268
- I can still hear.
- What?

575
01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:13.604
That your eyes are open.

576
01:02:15.105 --> 01:02:16.357
Who can sleep?

577
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:23.155
Would you come over here,
please?

578
01:02:26.825 --> 01:02:28.369
I won't hurt you.

579
01:02:33.832 --> 01:02:35.167
Sure, why not?

580
01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:42.383
Yeah,
I guess I'll be pretty safe.

581
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:50.849
Where will you go
when this is all done?

582
01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:54.937
I don't know.
Maybe another case.

583
01:02:56.772 --> 01:02:59.817
We'll see each other some more
when this is over, right?

584
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:03.904
You think that's a good idea?

585
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:06.240
I think it might be.

586
01:03:12.454 --> 01:03:14.456
I'll go check the window.

587
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.433
I think it might be
a very good idea.

588
01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:55.682
Morning.

589
01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:56.934
Hi.

590
01:05:01.271 --> 01:05:02.439
Where we going today?

591
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:03.941
Further upstate.

592
01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:07.152
We better check on Stalk,
see why she isn't out here.

593
01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:09.530
Better get in the car.

594
01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.865
What's wrong?
You look so mad.

595
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:14.451
I always look this way
before breakfast.

596
01:05:15.035 --> 01:05:16.370
- She's gone, man.
- What?

597
01:05:16.578 --> 01:05:17.579
Gone.

598
01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.292
Get inside.

599
01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:25.462
Get inside!

600
01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.098
Never liked that bitch.

601
01:05:36.473 --> 01:05:37.766
Me either.

602
01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.601
Get in the house.

603
01:05:43.063 --> 01:05:44.398
Get down over there.

604
01:07:24.498 --> 01:07:25.415
Come on!

605
01:07:54.903 --> 01:07:57.155
Tony! Tony!

606
01:07:58.198 --> 01:07:59.199
Tony!

607
01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.654
What do I do?

608
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.573
Go through it!

609
01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:22.741
Keep going!

610
01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.471
Come on, let's go!

611
01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:06.076
Down!

612
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:10.330
Go to the foundry.

613
01:14:04.898 --> 01:14:07.150
You have the right
to remain silent.

614
01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.250
Die, bitch!

615
01:14:25.001 --> 01:14:25.669
Stop!

616
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:35.178
No!

617
01:14:38.306 --> 01:14:39.599
Get out of there!

618
01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:39.868
Let's bleed, pig!

619
01:15:42.287 --> 01:15:43.204
Where are you?

620
01:15:48.918 --> 01:15:50.920
I want your eyes, pig!

621
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:53.173
I want them!

622
01:15:54.674 --> 01:15:56.176
You want to go to hell?

623
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:59.554
Huh? Huh, pig?

624
01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:03.683
You want to go to hell with me?

625
01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.519
It doesn't matter, does it?

626
01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:09.731
We are the hunters.

627
01:16:10.398 --> 01:16:11.691
We kill the weak...

628
01:16:11.941 --> 01:16:13.818
...so the strong survive.

629
01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:16.821
You can't stop the New World.

630
01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:20.533
Your filthy society will never
get rid of people like us.

631
01:16:21.367 --> 01:16:22.786
It's breeding them.

632
01:16:23.369 --> 01:16:25.330
We are the future!

633
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:26.456
No!

634
01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:30.001
You're history.

635
01:16:33.463 --> 01:16:35.507
You won't do it, pig.

636
01:16:36.341 --> 01:16:37.967
You won't shoot.

637
01:16:39.385 --> 01:16:41.888
Murder is against the law.

638
01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.142
You have to take me in.

639
01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:48.394
If...

640
01:16:48.728 --> 01:16:50.063
...you can.

641
01:16:51.981 --> 01:16:54.234
Even I have rights...

642
01:16:54.859 --> 01:16:56.069
...don't I...

643
01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.363
...pig?

644
01:17:00.365 --> 01:17:01.699
Take me in.

645
01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:05.203
They'll say I'm insane.

646
01:17:06.412 --> 01:17:07.831
Won't they?

647
01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.543
The court is civilized...

648
01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:13.461
...isn't it...

649
01:17:13.837 --> 01:17:14.963
...pig?

650
01:17:15.547 --> 01:17:17.423
But I'm not.

651
01:17:18.508 --> 01:17:21.010
This is where the law stops...

652
01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:23.596
...and I start...

653
01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:27.392
...sucker!

654
01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:52.917
Come on, pig.

655
01:20:19.564 --> 01:20:21.024
- You okay?
- Yeah.

656
01:20:22.483 --> 01:20:23.359
You sure?

657
01:20:24.485 --> 01:20:25.945
Let's get out of here.

658
01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:36.581
Yep. All right,
you guys, move out.

659
01:20:39.208 --> 01:20:43.087
Come on, you did your best.
Don't feel guilty.

660
01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:47.133
That's nice of you.
You going to be all right?

661
01:20:47.467 --> 01:20:49.969
I'm going to miss the
dance finals.

662
01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.097
Listen, can I get you anything?

663
01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:54.432
Yeah.

664
01:20:54.807 --> 01:20:57.101
I would kill for some...

665
01:20:57.727 --> 01:20:58.770
What?

666
01:20:59.354 --> 01:21:00.688
Gummy Bears.

667
01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:02.273
Gummy Bears?

668
01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:06.611
See you at the hospital.

669
01:21:06.819 --> 01:21:09.489
- Keep in touch.
- Don't drive too fast.

670
01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:10.406
Easy.

671
01:21:13.576 --> 01:21:15.453
All right, you guys,
clean it all up.

672
01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.414
Cobra.

673
01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:20.666
You did a hell of a job here.

674
01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:22.418
You ever want to get a transfer

675
01:21:22.668 --> 01:21:24.420
from the zombie squad to
something easier...

676
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:26.005
...or you need anything...

677
01:21:26.255 --> 01:21:27.715
...just say the word.

678
01:21:28.674 --> 01:21:29.384
Well...

679
01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:32.845
I would like to have
my car replaced.

680
01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:36.599
We'd like to,
but it's not in the budget.

681
01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:38.684
Well...

682
01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:40.728
See you back at headquarters.

683
01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.563
I'll take care of your
toy for you.

684
01:21:46.859 --> 01:21:47.944
Cobretti...

685
01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:49.654
No hard feelings.

686
01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.449
You kind of overdid it
around here.

687
01:21:53.866 --> 01:21:55.284
I personally would
have looked for...

688
01:21:55.451 --> 01:21:58.913
...a more subtle solution,
but that's not your style.

689
01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:01.165
No hard feelings.

690
01:22:15.471 --> 01:22:17.223
No hard feelings, pal.

691
01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.479
Cobra?

692
01:22:23.813 --> 01:22:24.981
I'll give you a lift.

693
01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.608
No, I've got my own
transportation, thanks.

694
01:22:28.067 --> 01:22:29.277
You ready?

695
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:31.362
Ready, Marion.

696
01:22:32.613 --> 01:22:34.282
Catchy name, isn't it?
