00:00:23.107 --> 00:00:26.095
Hey, Frank! Let's wrap it up and go home.
What do you say?

2
00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:30.706
I got another hour's work to do.
The kid'll stay, and I'll show him the ropes.

3
00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:32.836
Okay. Lock up for me before you go?

4
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.271
Fourth of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

5
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:39.636
Yeah. You have a nice Fourth,
and I'll see you Sunday at the barbecue.

6
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.299
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

7
00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.532
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

8
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:48.664
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

9
00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:52.601
Take it easy, Frank.

10
00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:55.469
That Burt's a joker.

11
00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.235
- Freddy, follow me and learn something.
- Okay.

12
00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:01.603
We got an order here from
the St. Louis University Medical School.

13
00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:04.800
They want two adult female skeletons
with perfect teeth.

14
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.102
That's a 2-AF-PT.

15
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:11.732
So you come over here to the "A" section.
That's "A" for adult, see?

16
00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.001
Then that's divided up into two sections.

17
00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.940
That's divided into the "M" for male
and the "F" for...

18
00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:20.100
- Female.
- Good boy. Now the "PT."

19
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.142
Suppose you think that's "pretty tough."
But no, that's...

20
00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:25.471
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

21
00:01:25.576 --> 00:01:28.804
Now you get some excelsior over there
and lay it in that crate.

22
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.070
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

23
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:33.900
Okay.

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.334
Good work. We want her to be comfortable.

25
00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:39.434
Now help me get her in. Grab her legs.

26
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.042
Okay.

27
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:46.008
Now you get some of that
Styrofoam popcorn, spread it all around.

28
00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:49.743
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

29
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:52.477
More, Freddy. Okay, that's fine.

30
00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:55.637
Now spread it around. That's right.

31
00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:57.870
- You're doing very nice work.
- Thanks.

32
00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:00.376
You'll be fine in the warehouse business.

33
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.535
- Where do we get all these skeletons?
- They come from India.

34
00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:05.271
- India?
- International treaty.

35
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:07.606
All skeletons come from India.

36
00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.644
- No kidding. How come?
- How the hell do I know?

37
00:02:10.745 --> 00:02:14.768
The important question is, where do they
get all the skeletons with perfect teeth?

38
00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:16.901
I'm going to ask you a serious question.

39
00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:19.070
How many people you know die...

40
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.509
with a beautiful, perfect
set of choppers in their puss?

41
00:02:22.612 --> 00:02:24.010
Nobody I can think of.

42
00:02:24.113 --> 00:02:27.341
No. I think there's a skeleton farm
over in India.

43
00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.667
Jesus!

44
00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.540
Come on, kid. Follow your uncle here.

45
00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.703
Here we go. I don't have to tell you
what these are for.

46
00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:42.208
Here we've got the prosthetic devices,
all around here.

47
00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:46.303
- Look under there. Wheelchairs.
- Right. These are great.

48
00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:49.846
Here's something you don't see very often.
You're a privileged person.

49
00:02:49.947 --> 00:02:53.471
These are split dogs
for veterinarian schools.

50
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.240
- We get a lot of orders for split dogs.
- That's really rad.

51
00:02:57.613 --> 00:02:59.443
Don't fool around, you're learning.

52
00:02:59.714 --> 00:03:03.375
Over here, Freddy,
is where we keep the fresh cadavers.

53
00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:08.239
We sell these to medical schools
and to the US Army for ballistic tests.

54
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:16.138
Say hello.

55
00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:27.308
We usually got more inventory than this...

56
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:30.405
but we're expecting a shipment on Monday.

57
00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.780
How many bodies are in here usually?

58
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:36.939
You don't want to be overstocked.

59
00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.878
Like the restaurant business...

60
00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:42.415
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

61
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.345
Tell you what I'll do, kid. Teach you
how to fill out these shipping forms.

62
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:52.916
Look alive.

63
00:03:57.683 --> 00:04:00.649
- We gonna party tonight or what?
- We are gonna party.

64
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.545
- Where we gonna party?
- I don't know. Somewhere.

65
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.742
We can go to the park.

66
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:07.942
We can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

67
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:11.040
- I ain't in no mood to die tonight.
- I like death.

68
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:15.174
- I like death with sex. And you, Casey?
- Yeah, so fuck off and die.

69
00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:16.773
When we gonna party tonight, Tina?

70
00:04:16.884 --> 00:04:19.816
That'd be rad, but I have to meet Freddy
when he's done work.

71
00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:23.146
- Where you supposed to meet him?
- At this medical supply warehouse.

72
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.480
No, he got a job? What a dick.

73
00:04:25.585 --> 00:04:29.177
Shit, why didn't you say so?
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

74
00:04:29.286 --> 00:04:31.649
He always knows
where there's a place to party.

75
00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:42.477
Frank?

76
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.015
Yeah, kid?

77
00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:47.876
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

78
00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:54.277
I have seen weird things come,
and I have seen weird things go.

79
00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:59.046
But the weirdest thing I ever saw
just had to cap it all.

80
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.683
Yeah? What's that?

81
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:04.010
Let me ask you a question, kid.

82
00:05:05.454 --> 00:05:09.353
Did you see that movie
Night of the Living Dead?

83
00:05:09.787 --> 00:05:12.947
That's the one where the corpses
start eating the people, right?

84
00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.917
Sure. What about it?

85
00:05:15.254 --> 00:05:18.186
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

86
00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:21.286
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

87
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.977
I've never been more serious in my life.

88
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:28.416
That's not possible. They showed
zombies taking over the world.

89
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:32.916
They changed it all around.
What really happened was...

90
00:05:33.222 --> 00:05:37.211
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the VA hospital...

91
00:05:37.322 --> 00:05:39.151
there was a chemical spill...

92
00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:44.046
and all that stuff leaked down
into the morgue...

93
00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:49.052
and it made all the dead bodies
jump around as though it was alive.

94
00:05:49.155 --> 00:05:53.145
- What chemical?
- 245-Trioxin, it's called.

95
00:05:53.622 --> 00:05:56.713
It was to spray on marijuana or something.

96
00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.115
And the Darrow Chemical Company
was trying to develop it for the army.

97
00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:04.685
And they told
the guy who made the movie...

98
00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.844
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

99
00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:12.185
So he changed all the facts around.

100
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:14.518
What really happened?

101
00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.055
They closed it all down...

102
00:06:17.757 --> 00:06:21.417
and the army shipped
all that contaminated dirt...

103
00:06:21.523 --> 00:06:23.785
and all those dead bodies out.

104
00:06:24.557 --> 00:06:26.750
And they kept it a secret.

105
00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:31.747
How come you know about it?

106
00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:34.847
A typical army fuck-up.

107
00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:39.221
The transportation department got
the orders crossed...

108
00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:43.254
and they shipped those bodies here...

109
00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:46.914
instead of to the Darrow Chemical Company.

110
00:06:52.392 --> 00:06:53.551
Hello?

111
00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:57.620
Hi, honey.
No, I'll be home in about an hour.

112
00:06:57.726 --> 00:07:00.249
You keep the pot roast hot, okay?

113
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.222
Sure, I love you too, honey.
Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

114
00:07:10.592 --> 00:07:12.218
Wanna see them?

115
00:07:14.194 --> 00:07:16.955
- See them?
- The corpses.

116
00:07:19.327 --> 00:07:20.815
What are you talking about?

117
00:07:21.027 --> 00:07:23.618
- They're down in the basement.
- No.

118
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.153
- Come on.
- No way.

119
00:07:33.294 --> 00:07:35.920
Mind the third step. It's a bitch.

120
00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.724
They just brought the bodies here
and left them?

121
00:07:38.828 --> 00:07:40.488
You know the army.

122
00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:45.084
- They've been here all this time?
- 14 years, as I recall.

123
00:07:46.462 --> 00:07:47.950
No kidding?

124
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.886
There they are.

125
00:07:52.794 --> 00:07:54.657
There's bodies in there?

126
00:08:13.296 --> 00:08:15.523
Shit. Look at that.

127
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:19.324
- You say that thing was alive?
- So they say.

128
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:26.554
Oh, God.

129
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.155
- Do these things leak?
- Hell, no.

130
00:08:30.263 --> 00:08:33.491
These things were made
by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

131
00:11:18.138 --> 00:11:22.070
- Hello, dear. How was your day?
- The usual, crap.

132
00:11:22.472 --> 00:11:23.801
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:27.133
- What's for dinner?
- Your favorite, lamb chops.

134
00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:29.000
I had them for lunch.

135
00:11:49.973 --> 00:11:52.996
It's me checking in
from Station 3 at 1600...

136
00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:55.300
make that 1601 hours.

137
00:11:55.407 --> 00:11:57.565
I'll be home all evening. Right.

138
00:12:11.574 --> 00:12:15.166
It's nerve-racking to live
around that equipment all the time.

139
00:12:15.274 --> 00:12:18.468
They have to be able to reach me
24 hours a day, wherever I am.

140
00:12:18.574 --> 00:12:21.870
- You know that.
- All that microwave stuff affects my oven.

141
00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.270
When we find them,
you can have it taken out.

142
00:12:24.374 --> 00:12:28.272
- But when will you find them?
- Christ, Ethel, I don't know.

143
00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:31.305
Maybe we'll never find them.

144
00:12:36.342 --> 00:12:40.172
We've been through all this before.
They could be anywhere.

145
00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.070
- Where the fuck are we going?
- To party.

146
00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:50.263
To pick up Freddy.

147
00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.399
- What the fuck is Freddy up to these days?
- He got a job.

148
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:55.873
- No shit? What job?
- He's a stockroom clerk.

149
00:12:55.976 --> 00:12:57.499
That sounds like a shitty job.

150
00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:01.042
It isn't the President of the US,
but he makes money to buy stuff.

151
00:13:01.143 --> 00:13:05.200
- Maybe he'll buy something from me.
- He don't like your kind of stuff, Suicide.

152
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.832
How come you guys only come by
when you need a ride?

153
00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:09.932
'Cause you one spooky motherfucker.

154
00:13:10.043 --> 00:13:13.737
You think I'm spooky?
What the fuck do you think you are?

155
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.370
- Man, what a hideous, ugly place.
- I like it. It's a statement.

156
00:13:29.478 --> 00:13:31.467
- Come on, let's go get the prick.
- No.

157
00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:33.635
- Why not?
- It might freak out his boss.

158
00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:35.302
That's not nice.

159
00:13:35.479 --> 00:13:38.274
What does he think we are,
weird or something?

160
00:13:38.378 --> 00:13:40.536
- What time does Freddy get off?
- 10:00.

161
00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:44.202
- I ain't sittin' here two fuckin' hours.
- We could go drive around.

162
00:13:44.312 --> 00:13:47.607
- I don't got gas. You wanna buy some?
- I was kidding.

163
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:51.474
- We could go fool around in there.
- You mean that cemetery?

164
00:13:52.312 --> 00:13:53.801
Let's do that.

165
00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:14.602
What do you want to do,
turn over gravestones?

166
00:14:14.713 --> 00:14:16.872
No, I just want to look around
the graveyard.

167
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.741
I ain't never seen one before.

168
00:14:18.847 --> 00:14:21.972
- You never been to a funeral?
- I never knew nobody that died.

169
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.012
I don't think this is a good idea.

170
00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:25.875
- What's that?
- Road flares, ass-wipe.

171
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.537
- What do you want with those?
- I just want to party.

172
00:14:28.646 --> 00:14:30.805
What are the road flares for?

173
00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.371
This place is a mess.

174
00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:51.874
- It looks like your pad, Scuz.
- I heard that.

175
00:15:05.316 --> 00:15:06.441
Frank?

176
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.111
Are you okay, kid?

177
00:15:26.816 --> 00:15:29.112
I don't know. I don't feel so good.

178
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.811
Christ, what a stink.

179
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:40.542
- What the hell happened to the body?
- It must have melted when it hit the air.

180
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.639
Close the goddamn thing.

181
00:15:53.617 --> 00:15:56.845
Christ, I never smelled anything
like that before.

182
00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:01.075
I think I'm gonna be sick.

183
00:16:21.786 --> 00:16:24.309
I don't guess
we'd better tell Burt about this.

184
00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.318
- It makes us look stupid or something.
- I can still smell that stuff.

185
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.749
It must be in my nose
or all over everything.

186
00:16:30.853 --> 00:16:34.013
I'd better spray some deodorant
around here.

187
00:16:48.787 --> 00:16:50.548
What was that?

188
00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:53.351
Sounds like a dog.

189
00:16:53.454 --> 00:16:54.885
A dog?

190
00:16:55.787 --> 00:16:59.413
Wait a second. Listen. You hear that?

191
00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:02.080
What the hell's going on here?

192
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:16.778
What's wrong with him?

193
00:17:19.855 --> 00:17:20.878
Shit!

194
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:25.545
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill it!

195
00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:31.415
What are you doing? Stop!

196
00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:38.885
Jesus!

197
00:17:41.822 --> 00:17:45.846
- Are we fucked? What's happening?
- The cadaver.

198
00:17:46.623 --> 00:17:49.646
- What's it doing in there?
- I don't know. It sounds sore.

199
00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:53.155
- What are we going to do?
- Lock it in.

200
00:17:55.623 --> 00:17:58.089
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

201
00:17:59.457 --> 00:18:01.184
We gotta think.

202
00:18:01.656 --> 00:18:03.588
Come on, son, get in there!

203
00:18:04.424 --> 00:18:05.821
Jesus Christ!

204
00:18:06.591 --> 00:18:09.955
- Are we going crazy?
- No, it's that crap from the tanks.

205
00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:12.751
The goddamn chemicals,
it's all over everything.

206
00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:16.154
- Stupid asshole!
- Watch your tongue if you like this job.

207
00:18:16.258 --> 00:18:18.655
- Like this job?
- Think!

208
00:18:18.858 --> 00:18:21.722
- We got to tell the cops.
- No, you don't want to call them.

209
00:18:21.824 --> 00:18:23.517
You know what they'd do to the company?

210
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:26.216
- Who cares about the company?
- Our reputation!

211
00:18:26.325 --> 00:18:28.258
- Fuck your reputation.
- Think!

212
00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:30.884
What about the number on the tank?

213
00:18:30.992 --> 00:18:35.084
- It said, "Call in case of an emergency."
- No, that's the army.

214
00:18:35.192 --> 00:18:38.919
You don't want the goddamn
army around this place. Think!

215
00:18:39.025 --> 00:18:41.491
- What are we gonna do?
- What are we gonna do?

216
00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:43.649
We're gonna call the boss.

217
00:18:56.826 --> 00:18:58.621
Burt? Frank.

218
00:18:59.026 --> 00:19:01.514
We have a little problem.

219
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.319
Do you ever fantasize...

220
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.388
about being killed?

221
00:19:08.693 --> 00:19:09.853
Never.

222
00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:15.086
Do you ever wonder about
all the different ways of dying...

223
00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:17.388
you know, violently...

224
00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:22.825
and wonder what
would be the most horrible way to die?

225
00:19:23.261 --> 00:19:25.852
I try not to think about dying too much.

226
00:19:28.128 --> 00:19:29.753
For me...

227
00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:32.422
the worst way...

228
00:19:33.395 --> 00:19:36.156
would be for a bunch of old men...

229
00:19:36.695 --> 00:19:38.524
to get around me...

230
00:19:39.162 --> 00:19:41.094
and start biting...

231
00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:43.690
and eating me alive.

232
00:19:43.828 --> 00:19:44.953
I see.

233
00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:47.027
First...

234
00:19:47.129 --> 00:19:50.323
they would tear off my clothes.

235
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:55.186
Let's get some light over here.
Trash is taking off her clothes again.

236
00:20:16.498 --> 00:20:17.929
Throw it, baby.

237
00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:19.960
Are you high on anything?

238
00:20:35.698 --> 00:20:39.687
You opened it? You stupid moron.
What's the matter with you?

239
00:20:39.798 --> 00:20:43.992
Haven't I always told you never
even to go near those goddamn tanks?

240
00:20:45.065 --> 00:20:47.553
- What are we gonna do?
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.

241
00:20:47.664 --> 00:20:51.324
I'm gonna be sued by the company,
investigated by the government.

242
00:20:51.432 --> 00:20:53.590
I might become famous,
might lose my business.

243
00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:56.824
I might even go to jail, goddamn it.
That's what I'm gonna do.

244
00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:07.421
On the other hand, we destroy all the
evidence and we keep our mouths shut.

245
00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:10.158
That's it! Let's do that.

246
00:21:11.732 --> 00:21:13.630
That's what we got to do.

247
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.023
One question.

248
00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:19.864
This guy screaming in here,
you're sure he's a dead cadaver?

249
00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:24.763
- Why don't you open the door and find out?
- I'm sorry. I'll take your word for that.

250
00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:28.663
If it is a reanimated body,
we'll have to kill it.

251
00:21:30.067 --> 00:21:32.931
- How do you kill something that's dead?
- How do I know?

252
00:21:33.033 --> 00:21:36.431
- I don't know, let me think.
- It's not a bad question.

253
00:21:36.901 --> 00:21:40.061
In that movie, they destroyed
the brain to kill them. Right?

254
00:21:40.168 --> 00:21:41.895
The brain, right.

255
00:21:43.701 --> 00:21:46.724
- What do doctors use to crack skulls with?
- Surgical drills.

256
00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:48.061
Here, hold this.

257
00:21:48.168 --> 00:21:51.293
Now listen to me very carefully.
Freddy, you'll open that door.

258
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:54.128
Come here, stand right over here.
Frank, right here.

259
00:21:54.235 --> 00:21:56.463
When it comes out, brain it with the axe.

260
00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:57.590
Jesus!

261
00:21:57.702 --> 00:22:01.499
How am I gonna stop it from moaning?
What's the matter with you?

262
00:22:01.602 --> 00:22:04.160
Come here. Get down there.
Stand by the door.

263
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:08.224
- It's gonna be all right, son.
- I don't think I can do this.

264
00:22:08.336 --> 00:22:10.495
You damn well better.
You got us into this.

265
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:12.564
Jesus!

266
00:22:13.402 --> 00:22:15.425
All right, Freddy. 22, right.

267
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.668
Be brave, Frank, goddamn it!

268
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.901
4, left.

269
00:22:27.569 --> 00:22:29.160
10, right.

270
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:45.298
Get him off!

271
00:23:00.304 --> 00:23:01.770
Coming.

272
00:23:01.905 --> 00:23:03.337
Hold it!

273
00:23:09.705 --> 00:23:13.035
- What the hell's going on, Burt?
- The brain!

274
00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:15.128
I hit the fucking brain!

275
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:18.762
Then do something else,
for goddamn-it-to-hell's sake.

276
00:23:19.205 --> 00:23:20.932
Hold him down.

277
00:23:21.605 --> 00:23:24.766
I can't stand this any longer.

278
00:23:25.539 --> 00:23:27.596
- Shit!
- Hold him down now!

279
00:23:27.706 --> 00:23:29.672
What are you gonna do?

280
00:23:33.306 --> 00:23:37.466
- Be a man!
- I can't stand this, you son of a bitch.

281
00:23:37.939 --> 00:23:39.632
Hurry up!

282
00:24:00.707 --> 00:24:02.696
I'll get him.

283
00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:05.400
I got him. Get a rope!

284
00:24:05.508 --> 00:24:09.464
- Where the fuck's a rope?
- I don't know. Get one. Hold him down!

285
00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:13.473
- Hang on to the son of a bitch!
- Christ, it ain't dying.

286
00:24:13.841 --> 00:24:16.773
I thought you said
if we destroyed the brain, it'd die!

287
00:24:16.875 --> 00:24:19.467
- It worked in the movie.
- It ain't working now.

288
00:24:19.574 --> 00:24:22.699
- You mean the movie lied?
- Jesus.

289
00:24:28.076 --> 00:24:32.372
- How are we gonna kill it?
- Maybe you can't. Maybe it won't die.

290
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:39.034
We just got to destroy it completely
until there's nothing left.

291
00:24:39.176 --> 00:24:40.233
Acid.

292
00:24:40.675 --> 00:24:44.472
- What kind of acid would dissolve a body?
- Sulfuric acid, maybe.

293
00:24:44.575 --> 00:24:47.770
No, aqua regia, that's stronger.

294
00:24:47.877 --> 00:24:51.536
But what if it doesn't dissolve everything,
like the bones?

295
00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:53.310
Shit!

296
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.942
What are we gonna do?

297
00:25:00.144 --> 00:25:01.405
Where are you going?

298
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.099
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late on Fridays.

299
00:25:07.211 --> 00:25:09.177
Who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

300
00:25:09.278 --> 00:25:12.005
He's the embalmer
at the mortuary across the street.

301
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:15.873
- What the hell's he gonna do for us?
- His light's on. He's in.

302
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:20.904
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street.

303
00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:23.602
A crematorium, that's beautiful.

304
00:25:23.711 --> 00:25:28.007
- Think you can get him to go along with it?
- I don't know. I've known him for 25 years.

305
00:25:28.111 --> 00:25:29.941
He might do it out of friendship.

306
00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:34.500
What the hell are you gonna tell him?
I mean, can you trust that bastard?

307
00:25:35.012 --> 00:25:37.342
I don't think we have a choice.

308
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:40.707
How we gonna get this thing over there?

309
00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.901
Give me the bone saw.

310
00:25:53.247 --> 00:25:56.008
Why don't you put your clothes on?
The show's over.

311
00:25:56.113 --> 00:25:59.102
What's the matter?
Does it make you nervous?

312
00:26:00.347 --> 00:26:01.744
I'm hot.

313
00:26:03.447 --> 00:26:05.935
- You are hot.
- Scram, wimp.

314
00:26:12.448 --> 00:26:14.777
Nobody understands me, you know that?

315
00:26:14.881 --> 00:26:17.904
I fuckin' bust my ass for you guys,
and what do I get?

316
00:26:18.014 --> 00:26:19.707
"You're spooky."

317
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.340
Fuck you, man. Fuck you all.

318
00:26:22.448 --> 00:26:24.107
I like it spooky.

319
00:26:25.047 --> 00:26:28.706
I got somethin' to say, you know?
What do you think this is all about?

320
00:26:28.814 --> 00:26:32.577
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

321
00:26:32.982 --> 00:26:34.107
Yes.

322
00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:40.877
What's wrong with you, man?
Show some fucking respect for the dead.

323
00:26:44.948 --> 00:26:46.244
Is that Freddy?

324
00:26:46.349 --> 00:26:48.678
- Where?
- Over there, going into that building.

325
00:26:48.782 --> 00:26:51.010
Nope. That is not Freddy.

326
00:26:51.748 --> 00:26:55.511
- How would you know?
- Why would he be going into a mortuary?

327
00:27:47.818 --> 00:27:49.681
What do you say, Ernie?

328
00:27:58.752 --> 00:28:01.446
- Take it easy.
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.

329
00:28:02.219 --> 00:28:03.946
Fast on the draw.

330
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:10.981
- You are working late tonight.
- Pretty much. Kind of...

331
00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:14.375
What time is it? You want a cup of coffee?

332
00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:17.941
- No, thank you. I'm all right.
- I do, and I need it.

333
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.016
What are you doing there?

334
00:28:24.987 --> 00:28:26.919
Breaking out the rigor mortis.

335
00:28:27.154 --> 00:28:28.279
Yeah?

336
00:28:29.553 --> 00:28:30.849
Come here.

337
00:28:32.487 --> 00:28:36.419
Come on.
You see, rigor mortis starts in the brain.

338
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.318
And it spreads down to the internal organs,
and it finally settles in the muscles.

339
00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:47.284
It loosens up after a while...

340
00:28:48.155 --> 00:28:52.019
but you can break it out manually,
as they say...

341
00:28:52.288 --> 00:28:54.015
by flexing the muscles.

342
00:28:54.288 --> 00:28:55.844
- See that?
- Yeah.

343
00:28:56.121 --> 00:28:58.349
You'll not find that in a book, my friend.

344
00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:02.320
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

345
00:29:02.422 --> 00:29:06.013
I'll tell you, that's fascinating,
that's really something.

346
00:29:09.322 --> 00:29:12.482
He's dead now. And I am bushed.

347
00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:18.083
Buddy boy.

348
00:29:19.356 --> 00:29:22.323
How long we been friends? About how long?

349
00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.981
Twenty-five years, give or take.

350
00:29:27.689 --> 00:29:30.712
If I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

351
00:29:30.823 --> 00:29:32.414
Sure. What is it?

352
00:29:32.656 --> 00:29:36.816
I'm gonna need some help
in a pretty big way, really.

353
00:29:37.257 --> 00:29:40.121
You can depend on me. Why? What's wrong?

354
00:29:40.723 --> 00:29:43.849
I got a couple of my men out here,
you mind if I let them in?

355
00:29:43.957 --> 00:29:46.048
No, that's illegal.

356
00:29:46.158 --> 00:29:48.249
You can bring it on in now, please.

357
00:29:48.358 --> 00:29:51.949
You can put it right over here.
Right here.

358
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:56.455
What is that?

359
00:30:00.191 --> 00:30:02.317
- Right there, please.
- Here?

360
00:30:11.392 --> 00:30:12.687
I got to...

361
00:30:17.058 --> 00:30:19.286
What the hell's in those bags?

362
00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:22.091
Rabid weasels.

363
00:30:22.192 --> 00:30:25.091
What the hell are you doing
with a bunch of rabid weasels?

364
00:30:25.193 --> 00:30:27.784
I was trying to explain it.
They came as a shipment.

365
00:30:27.893 --> 00:30:31.757
They weren't supposed to be rabid,
but you know how these things happen.

366
00:30:31.859 --> 00:30:33.291
I don't. How do they happen?

367
00:30:33.393 --> 00:30:35.790
Watch out, don't get bit.

368
00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:38.516
Anyway, we got them,
and we need your help.

369
00:30:38.626 --> 00:30:41.820
- How?
- We got to get rid of these things.

370
00:30:41.926 --> 00:30:44.359
Why don't you call an animal shelter?

371
00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:48.188
Word'd get out, hurt my business.
You know, that's a bad scene, rabies.

372
00:30:48.427 --> 00:30:49.722
I don't think so.

373
00:30:49.827 --> 00:30:52.622
I mean, so what?
You don't run a pet store.

374
00:30:52.727 --> 00:30:57.557
Some lab animals got rabies.
Come on, take them to the pound.

375
00:30:59.194 --> 00:31:02.456
I just can't do that.
You got to take my word for it.

376
00:31:04.294 --> 00:31:07.727
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- You have a crematorium, right?

377
00:31:07.828 --> 00:31:10.317
- You wanna burn them?
- That's what I had in mind.

378
00:31:10.895 --> 00:31:13.918
- That's cruel.
- I can't think of anything else to do.

379
00:31:14.028 --> 00:31:18.653
You just can't burn animals alive.
It's just too hideous.

380
00:31:19.295 --> 00:31:20.726
At least let me kill them first.

381
00:31:20.828 --> 00:31:24.056
Take them out in the parking lot,
and put 'em out of their misery.

382
00:31:25.694 --> 00:31:27.684
I don't think that'd work.

383
00:31:28.829 --> 00:31:31.489
I don't understand what's going on.
Why not?

384
00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:41.717
- Can you swear to keep a secret?
- At this point, I don't know.

385
00:31:41.829 --> 00:31:45.455
No, you got to swear.
You got to, or I just can't tell you.

386
00:31:45.562 --> 00:31:49.462
- All right, I swear.
- Good.

387
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.426
It's not weasels in the bags.

388
00:31:58.097 --> 00:31:59.995
No kidding. Look here.

389
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:12.696
Get it off!

390
00:32:25.031 --> 00:32:26.621
I'm sorry.

391
00:32:26.731 --> 00:32:29.129
No, it's all right.

392
00:32:36.132 --> 00:32:37.688
We got a...

393
00:32:38.632 --> 00:32:40.394
We got a long story to tell you.

394
00:32:40.665 --> 00:32:44.961
Great. Some party.
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

395
00:32:45.432 --> 00:32:47.761
Probably getting it on somewhere.

396
00:32:49.299 --> 00:32:51.357
Don't even think it, Chuck.

397
00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:54.431
God, when's 10:00 gonna come?

398
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.789
If you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

399
00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:02.991
You'd really like to do it with me,
wouldn't you?

400
00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:08.165
- I mean, a girl like you and a guy like me.
- Go choke a chicken.

401
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.296
Come on, Casey. I was only kidding.

402
00:33:11.468 --> 00:33:15.661
- Great, here's your friend and mine.
- Fuck you, ball buster.

403
00:33:17.834 --> 00:33:20.300
My watch stopped. What time is it?

404
00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:27.894
Going on 10:00.

405
00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:32.159
Fudge. I'd better get over and find Freddy.
He's gonna be getting off any time.

406
00:33:32.268 --> 00:33:33.700
Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

407
00:33:33.802 --> 00:33:35.961
- Don't go anywhere, okay?
- All right.

408
00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:38.603
Come on, Freddy, where are you?

409
00:34:39.105 --> 00:34:43.197
Frankly, I think you acted
precipitously in cutting up the corpse.

410
00:34:43.305 --> 00:34:45.964
You may be right,
I don't know, but I did it.

411
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:48.559
What are we gonna do about it?

412
00:34:50.205 --> 00:34:53.534
If I let you use the crematorium,
what's in it for me?

413
00:34:55.604 --> 00:34:57.196
What do you want?

414
00:35:00.306 --> 00:35:03.272
The way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

415
00:35:03.373 --> 00:35:08.203
You got it! Whatever it is you want,
so help me, I'll do it. I promise.

416
00:35:11.406 --> 00:35:13.167
I'm sorry about that.

417
00:35:37.007 --> 00:35:38.906
Let's take care of your problem.

418
00:35:49.175 --> 00:35:50.868
You're gonna owe me a big one.

419
00:35:50.974 --> 00:35:53.701
You're gonna get rid of everything for me.
Nothing left.

420
00:35:53.808 --> 00:35:56.070
- Is that right?
- Everything'll go.

421
00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:02.237
What about the bones?

422
00:36:02.342 --> 00:36:06.240
Bones are no problem.
The hardest thing to burn is the heart.

423
00:36:07.042 --> 00:36:10.667
- The heart? Why?
- 'Cause it's just one big, tough muscle.

424
00:36:11.775 --> 00:36:15.333
Come on.
We don't want the heart sticking around.

425
00:36:15.442 --> 00:36:17.271
Then I'll turn it up hotter for it.

426
00:36:17.376 --> 00:36:19.308
What about the split dogs? They got to go.

427
00:36:19.409 --> 00:36:21.568
The split dogs will go, too.

428
00:36:25.177 --> 00:36:27.836
Come on, just give me a hand.
It's your mess.

429
00:36:34.976 --> 00:36:38.431
Some big favor.
I can operate that goddamn thing.

430
00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:41.042
You're absolutely certain...

431
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.334
that this will get rid of everything
and do the trick?

432
00:36:44.444 --> 00:36:47.500
- Nothing left?
- Nothing but a little-bitty pile of ashes.

433
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.338
We don't even want the ashes.

434
00:36:49.444 --> 00:36:53.467
Then I'll turn it up higher,
and we'll burn up the ashes, too.

435
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.167
Dust to dust.

436
00:37:56.014 --> 00:37:57.912
- My radio.
- Come on, you guys.

437
00:37:58.014 --> 00:38:00.480
Let's get back to the car. Damn it.

438
00:38:00.814 --> 00:38:02.075
Come on.

439
00:38:17.448 --> 00:38:18.674
Freddy?

440
00:38:19.815 --> 00:38:21.042
Anybody?

441
00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:23.612
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.

442
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:29.541
Come on!

443
00:38:31.782 --> 00:38:35.078
- Close the motherfuckin' windows.
- I don't have any windows.

444
00:38:35.183 --> 00:38:36.546
I busted them.

445
00:38:37.316 --> 00:38:40.146
- Hey, my skin burns.
- Me, too. Damn it.

446
00:38:40.249 --> 00:38:42.340
It's that rain, it's like acid rain.

447
00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:43.914
Start the car!

448
00:38:44.016 --> 00:38:46.538
It's all over me.
A towel, somebody give me a towel.

449
00:38:46.649 --> 00:38:49.673
- We ain't got no towel!
- Well, then give me something.

450
00:38:49.783 --> 00:38:51.612
- Give me that.
- No!

451
00:38:53.284 --> 00:38:54.544
Come on, start!

452
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.310
- Suicide, get the car going.
- I'm trying.

453
00:38:57.883 --> 00:39:00.713
Crap, I wonder what's in that rain.

454
00:39:15.551 --> 00:39:18.143
It's coming down like
<i>einen getrunken soldat</i>.

455
00:39:46.152 --> 00:39:49.414
- Is the heart gone, Ernie?
- It's all burned up.

456
00:39:49.518 --> 00:39:51.678
- Are you sure?
- Right up the chimney.

457
00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:54.809
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank.

458
00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.682
We got it made. You just saved our ass,
buddy boy, and I owe you one. Goddamn!

459
00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:02.083
Yes, you do.

460
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.708
Let's go to the warehouse, clean up,
and get the hell out of there.

461
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.116
What do you say, Frank?

462
00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.515
Okay, just give me a second to rest
and catch my breath. Then we'll go, okay?

463
00:40:11.686 --> 00:40:14.449
I don't know about you,
but I'm really sick.

464
00:40:14.554 --> 00:40:16.248
What's wrong, Fred?

465
00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.453
I feel like hell is what's wrong.
I'm really sick.

466
00:40:19.554 --> 00:40:21.282
I'm sick, too, Burt.

467
00:40:21.654 --> 00:40:25.485
- Sick, like how?
- Like my head's going to bust wide open.

468
00:40:27.587 --> 00:40:32.519
- And I want to puke. And I'm weak, too.
- Me, too. I got the chills.

469
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.519
It's that stuff, Burt.
It's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

470
00:40:35.621 --> 00:40:37.610
What stuff? What are you talking about?

471
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:41.017
When that canister cracked,
this gas squirted out.

472
00:40:41.122 --> 00:40:43.145
It hit us right in the face.

473
00:40:43.355 --> 00:40:44.911
We breathed it.

474
00:40:45.855 --> 00:40:47.481
It knocked us out.

475
00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:51.516
- We were out cold, unconscious.
- Christ!

476
00:40:51.922 --> 00:40:54.115
Shouldn't we get to a doctor or something?

477
00:40:54.222 --> 00:40:55.484
Yeah, I need a doctor.

478
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:58.885
I'm getting the car and taking
these guys to the emergency ward.

479
00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:02.080
Let's go, Frank. You're gonna be
all right. I'm gonna get you...

480
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.621
Hey, Frank!

481
00:41:10.522 --> 00:41:11.886
Come here, Ernie.

482
00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:15.387
What's the matter? Talk to me.
Get him out of the rain.

483
00:41:17.723 --> 00:41:21.156
I got to call my wife.
I gotta go to the hospital!

484
00:41:21.424 --> 00:41:24.617
You can't run around in this storm.
You're too sick.

485
00:41:24.723 --> 00:41:25.882
Burt.

486
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:29.389
Take it easy.

487
00:41:29.957 --> 00:41:32.423
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
- Paramedics.

488
00:41:35.957 --> 00:41:38.015
It's all right. How do you feel now?

489
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:47.887
Hello. Yes. Can we get some paramedics
over here right away?

490
00:41:48.758 --> 00:41:51.452
That's the Resurrection Funeral Home...

491
00:41:51.958 --> 00:41:55.447
at 21702 East Central.

492
00:41:57.392 --> 00:42:01.120
Tell them to come around the back,
to the embalming room.

493
00:42:04.293 --> 00:42:07.554
Poison. We have two men poisoned here.

494
00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:10.787
No, we don't know what kind of poison.

495
00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:13.486
Right.

496
00:42:13.859 --> 00:42:15.848
Thank you very much. Bye.

497
00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:19.619
Burt, they're on their way.

498
00:42:22.494 --> 00:42:24.982
- This car ain't going nowhere.
- Damn it.

499
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.889
Do you hear something?

500
00:42:28.194 --> 00:42:29.557
Hear what?

501
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.187
Something.

502
00:42:59.527 --> 00:43:02.393
- No, I don't hear nothing.
- This roof's leaking.

503
00:43:02.496 --> 00:43:04.688
There's a rip, damn it. Shit.

504
00:43:04.795 --> 00:43:06.386
- Don't do that!
- Sorry.

505
00:43:06.496 --> 00:43:07.654
- Damn it!
- I'm sorry.

506
00:43:07.762 --> 00:43:08.625
Shit, Scuz!

507
00:43:09.462 --> 00:43:10.950
Hello, there?

508
00:43:11.595 --> 00:43:12.891
Freddy?

509
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:19.084
Anybody?

510
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.759
Freddy? Are you here?

511
00:43:55.931 --> 00:43:57.363
Anybody here?

512
00:44:22.332 --> 00:44:23.957
Who's there?

513
00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:28.422
Brains!

514
00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:32.356
Brains!

515
00:44:35.532 --> 00:44:38.862
- I got to get out of here.
- Let's go to where Tina and Freddy are.

516
00:44:38.966 --> 00:44:40.795
- Damn right.
- Fuckin' A.

517
00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:47.624
Live brain.

518
00:45:11.101 --> 00:45:12.397
Come on, quick!

519
00:45:34.602 --> 00:45:36.932
God, my skin's really burning.

520
00:45:46.669 --> 00:45:48.101
Hey, Tina!

521
00:45:48.336 --> 00:45:50.859
Yes, God! Help me!

522
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.868
- That's Tina.
- What's she yelling about?

523
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:55.368
- What's that sound?
- Through that door!

524
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.533
Watch the fuckin' step!

525
00:45:59.137 --> 00:46:00.467
Help me!

526
00:46:01.103 --> 00:46:02.364
What the fuck?

527
00:46:07.837 --> 00:46:08.996
Brains!

528
00:46:22.737 --> 00:46:24.465
More brains.

529
00:46:32.105 --> 00:46:35.832
Where the fuck you going?
Help me bar the door! Stupid fuckers!

530
00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.236
It's them.

531
00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.901
- Who took the poison?
- Right over there.

532
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.031
Stick your tongue out for me.

533
00:47:17.308 --> 00:47:18.773
What did you guys take?

534
00:47:18.874 --> 00:47:23.466
It was some kind of industrial chemical,
something in a tank.

535
00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:27.834
- What tank? Where?
- Well, we're not sure, really.

536
00:47:27.974 --> 00:47:31.338
Can you find out?
Your friends' lives may depend on it.

537
00:47:31.441 --> 00:47:36.170
I got to make some phone calls,
but I can't do that before morning. Sorry.

538
00:47:36.375 --> 00:47:38.533
Let's take some vital signs.

539
00:47:46.042 --> 00:47:48.474
- Can I borrow your stethoscope?
- What's the matter?

540
00:47:48.575 --> 00:47:51.474
- I can't hear through mine.
- Are you sure it's the equipment?

541
00:47:51.575 --> 00:47:52.700
What do you mean?

542
00:47:52.808 --> 00:47:55.401
I'm not getting anything on this, either.

543
00:47:55.709 --> 00:47:57.471
What do you mean? What's wrong?

544
00:47:58.843 --> 00:48:02.741
It's all right. We just need
to double-check a couple things.

545
00:48:12.376 --> 00:48:14.534
- No blood pressure.
- No pulse.

546
00:48:15.043 --> 00:48:17.306
What do you mean,
"no blood pressure, no pulse"?

547
00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:18.842
Take it easy.

548
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.503
- What do you have?
- 70.

549
00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:30.270
- 70 what?
- 70 degrees.

550
00:48:30.377 --> 00:48:32.842
- Well, what's that?
- Room temperature.

551
00:48:34.643 --> 00:48:37.872
Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

552
00:48:42.878 --> 00:48:44.844
What are you guys saying?

553
00:48:48.378 --> 00:48:51.344
- What was that thing down there?
- What are we gonna do?

554
00:48:51.445 --> 00:48:55.002
- Suicide is down there.
- No, he's gone. That thing ate his head.

555
00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:56.372
Jesus!

556
00:48:57.911 --> 00:49:00.878
- I don't hear anything down there.
- We got to call somebody.

557
00:49:00.979 --> 00:49:02.706
- Who?
- The cops.

558
00:49:02.812 --> 00:49:05.835
I don't want to call no cop.
They're just gonna kick our ass.

559
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:09.639
- Just let's get out of here, okay?
- We gotta call somebody.

560
00:49:09.846 --> 00:49:12.039
Wait a minute, where's Freddy?

561
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.878
Holy shit. We're gonna have to swim
to get over there.

562
00:49:42.547 --> 00:49:45.070
- What the fuck was that?
- Look!

563
00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:46.475
There!

564
00:50:17.482 --> 00:50:20.448
Hey, wait up, you guys!
Wait, I got no shoes!

565
00:50:37.116 --> 00:50:39.673
You have no pulse, no blood pressure.

566
00:50:39.783 --> 00:50:44.308
You have no pupillary response, no
reflexes, your temperature is 70 degrees.

567
00:50:45.884 --> 00:50:47.248
What does that mean?

568
00:50:47.351 --> 00:50:50.783
It's a puzzle,
because technically you're not alive.

569
00:50:50.884 --> 00:50:53.645
Except you're conscious,
so we don't know what it means.

570
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.511
- Are you saying we're dead?
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

571
00:50:56.617 --> 00:50:59.379
Obviously, I didn't mean
you were really dead.

572
00:50:59.617 --> 00:51:02.209
Dead people don't move around and talk.

573
00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:04.915
- What is that?
- The front door.

574
00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:07.484
- What the fuck are they doing?
- I'll find out.

575
00:51:07.585 --> 00:51:09.608
We're gonna get a couple of stretchers.

576
00:51:09.718 --> 00:51:12.480
Just hang in there. We won't be a second.

577
00:51:12.918 --> 00:51:15.441
- Open the door.
- Open the door, please.

578
00:51:19.518 --> 00:51:22.007
- Open the door!
- Hurry up!

579
00:51:24.818 --> 00:51:27.546
- Freeze, or you're dead!
- Don't shoot, man!

580
00:51:27.652 --> 00:51:29.845
Are you crazy? Are you on PCP?

581
00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.919
None of us are on any drugs. Let us in!

582
00:51:32.019 --> 00:51:35.076
- All right, come in. But no funny moves.
- Shit, no.

583
00:51:35.286 --> 00:51:38.581
Lock your doors and windows,
call the cops! They're out there!

584
00:51:38.686 --> 00:51:40.414
- Who?
- Don't you hear that?

585
00:51:40.519 --> 00:51:42.678
- What?
- Shut up and listen, man!

586
00:51:45.552 --> 00:51:47.781
- What is it?
- It's dead people screaming.

587
00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:50.819
- What dead people?
- They came from out of the ground.

588
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.943
- And they're after us.
- Out of the ground?

589
00:51:53.054 --> 00:51:55.918
Our friends took off the other way.
They're out there now!

590
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.352
Brains!

591
00:52:12.388 --> 00:52:15.115
- Trash? Where's Trash?
- Didn't she go with them?

592
00:52:15.222 --> 00:52:17.211
I thought she was with us.

593
00:52:19.554 --> 00:52:21.713
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

594
00:52:24.388 --> 00:52:25.910
Christ. Jesus.

595
00:52:26.621 --> 00:52:29.816
- What is that?
- It sounds like people screaming.

596
00:52:30.622 --> 00:52:34.554
You get the stretchers,
I'll get on the radio and phone this in.

597
00:52:53.957 --> 00:52:55.082
Jerry?

598
00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:04.680
Brain!

599
00:53:08.523 --> 00:53:11.649
- What kind of a problem?
- Take a look at it.

600
00:53:11.757 --> 00:53:13.746
What the hell's going on out here?

601
00:53:13.858 --> 00:53:16.983
That graveyard out there is full
of people coming out the ground.

602
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:19.852
- "Out of the ground"?
- Out of the ground.

603
00:53:19.958 --> 00:53:21.356
They're horrible, they scream.

604
00:53:21.458 --> 00:53:23.287
- You've got to do something.
- Scream?

605
00:53:23.391 --> 00:53:26.845
Yes, they're out there.
There's one of them in that warehouse.

606
00:53:26.958 --> 00:53:29.220
- Which warehouse?
- The medical supply house.

607
00:53:29.325 --> 00:53:30.722
Shit!

608
00:53:31.391 --> 00:53:32.584
Goddamn!

609
00:53:32.692 --> 00:53:35.215
I think things are getting out of hand.

610
00:53:35.326 --> 00:53:37.985
There's 100 of those things out there.

611
00:53:38.092 --> 00:53:39.058
A hundred?

612
00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:42.624
- The cops. We got to call the cops.
- Yeah. No shit.

613
00:53:43.326 --> 00:53:46.486
Phone. Where the fuck is the phone?

614
00:53:46.592 --> 00:53:48.491
There's an office!

615
00:53:53.427 --> 00:53:57.018
Hello, Operator, give me the police.
This is an emergency.

616
00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.882
Grab the hammer and nails! Casey!

617
00:54:05.993 --> 00:54:09.084
Quiet! Let's just get the hell
out of here, Ernie.

618
00:54:09.193 --> 00:54:10.954
- You got a car?
- I got a car.

619
00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:14.185
- Get your keys. Let's get out of here.
- My clutch is shot.

620
00:54:14.294 --> 00:54:16.691
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

621
00:54:17.194 --> 00:54:18.353
Freddy!

622
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:19.751
- Ernie?
- Yeah?

623
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:23.225
- Where are the paramedics?
- I'll go get them. Get my own car started.

624
00:54:23.328 --> 00:54:26.589
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

625
00:55:08.996 --> 00:55:10.223
God!

626
00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:11.886
- What was that shooting?
- God!

627
00:55:11.996 --> 00:55:14.053
- What?
- God!

628
00:55:16.729 --> 00:55:19.162
- What the hell?
- It...

629
00:55:21.864 --> 00:55:23.989
"It" what? What is "it"?

630
00:55:24.097 --> 00:55:26.086
They're all over the cars.

631
00:55:26.663 --> 00:55:28.856
It's horrible. They're out there.

632
00:55:30.164 --> 00:55:33.823
Paramedics are dead.
And we can't take the cars.

633
00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:37.397
We've got to call the police.

634
00:55:37.497 --> 00:55:40.759
Set him down. Easy.

635
00:55:44.131 --> 00:55:46.063
- It's not working.
- Come on.

636
00:56:04.665 --> 00:56:06.858
- What's the matter?
- Dead.

637
00:56:18.499 --> 00:56:19.794
Help me.

638
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:29.962
You got some hammer and nails?

639
00:56:50.368 --> 00:56:54.061
- Where else can they get in here?
- The windows in the chapel.

640
00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:03.033
Get something to bar these windows with.

641
00:57:03.135 --> 00:57:05.124
I put boards outside the glass.

642
00:57:19.735 --> 00:57:23.429
Rescue 7, come in. This is Dispatch. Over.

643
00:57:26.703 --> 00:57:30.067
Rescue 7, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy? Over.

644
00:57:31.403 --> 00:57:33.164
Come in, Dispatch.

645
00:57:33.437 --> 00:57:34.732
Send...

646
00:57:34.836 --> 00:57:36.063
more...

647
00:57:36.170 --> 00:57:37.567
paramedics.

648
00:57:53.204 --> 00:57:55.261
How many fucking windows you got here?

649
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:57.098
No more windows.

650
00:57:57.871 --> 00:57:59.803
The embalming room has steel shutters.

651
00:57:59.904 --> 00:58:03.302
Let's get the hell back
to the embalming room then.

652
00:58:07.938 --> 00:58:09.870
Man, my arms are dead.

653
00:58:09.972 --> 00:58:13.597
Put that goddamn thing down
before you hurt somebody with it.

654
00:58:13.805 --> 00:58:14.998
How they doing?

655
00:58:15.105 --> 00:58:17.536
- Are you all right?
- It hurts.

656
00:58:17.638 --> 00:58:21.469
What did you do to Freddy?
What's wrong with him? And this man?

657
00:58:21.571 --> 00:58:23.867
It's time you tell us
what the fuck's going on.

658
00:58:23.972 --> 00:58:27.098
- I don't have to tell you anything.
- We think you should.

659
00:58:27.206 --> 00:58:28.796
Tell them, goddamn it!

660
00:58:30.672 --> 00:58:31.865
Tell us!

661
00:58:32.606 --> 00:58:34.300
There was a chemical.

662
00:58:35.572 --> 00:58:37.504
Some chemical soaked into the...

663
00:58:37.606 --> 00:58:40.697
soil of the graveyard
and made the corpses come back to life.

664
00:58:40.806 --> 00:58:44.568
- What fucking chemical?
- I don't know what chemical, goddamn it!

665
00:58:44.672 --> 00:58:47.366
It was ordered by the military,
I think it was.

666
00:58:47.473 --> 00:58:50.167
Would you tell me how
it got all over the graveyard?

667
00:58:50.274 --> 00:58:52.297
I don't know. I just...

668
00:58:52.673 --> 00:58:56.003
All I know is they were stored
over at the medical supply warehouse...

669
00:58:56.107 --> 00:59:00.130
where you were, and these two geniuses
managed to open the goddamn container...

670
00:59:00.241 --> 00:59:03.173
and let the son of a bitch out.
Let 'em out!

671
00:59:03.274 --> 00:59:06.434
- Is that why Freddy's sick?
- I breathed it, Tina.

672
00:59:07.074 --> 00:59:09.098
So did Frank there.

673
00:59:11.641 --> 00:59:14.607
- What did it do to you?
- I'm freezing.

674
00:59:15.641 --> 00:59:17.130
My muscles are stiffening up.

675
00:59:17.541 --> 00:59:19.132
Stiffening up?

676
00:59:19.741 --> 00:59:21.639
Stiffening up how?

677
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:24.139
First, I got a really fucked headache.

678
00:59:24.808 --> 00:59:28.206
Then my stomach started cramping up.

679
00:59:28.808 --> 00:59:31.207
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

680
00:59:32.775 --> 00:59:35.707
- Let's take a look.
- Oh, God!

681
00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:40.674
Let's get his shirt up.

682
00:59:41.575 --> 00:59:44.303
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God.

683
00:59:45.575 --> 00:59:48.064
The bruises where he's lying down...

684
00:59:49.575 --> 00:59:51.440
that's blood pooling up.

685
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:55.174
Easy.

686
00:59:57.509 --> 00:59:58.566
Okay.

687
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:06.567
You know,
it looks like rigor mortis is setting in.

688
01:00:07.077 --> 01:00:10.339
Rigor mortis?
What do you mean, rigor mortis?

689
01:00:11.344 --> 01:00:14.277
God, you're dead.

690
01:00:14.378 --> 01:00:17.242
You're dead, and you'll turn
into one of those things.

691
01:00:17.345 --> 01:00:18.333
No!

692
01:00:21.178 --> 01:00:23.167
- Let him go!
- Son of a bitch!

693
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.302
Do you hear that?

694
01:00:33.312 --> 01:00:36.505
- What is that?
- It's another paramedic ambulance.

695
01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:50.735
- Watch out!
- Don't go over there!

696
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.711
Damn!

697
01:00:57.813 --> 01:01:00.779
They're gonna kill everybody
that comes here.

698
01:01:20.014 --> 01:01:23.276
Watch out,
I'm going to put the board back up.

699
01:01:27.181 --> 01:01:28.544
It's got me!

700
01:01:45.548 --> 01:01:47.481
Get this thing out of here!

701
01:01:49.048 --> 01:01:51.014
Pull her off.

702
01:01:53.648 --> 01:01:54.511
Christ.

703
01:01:55.815 --> 01:01:57.577
Damn, he's dead. Shit.

704
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:00.445
What do we do with this thing?

705
01:02:01.682 --> 01:02:04.512
- Just wait there a second.
- Let's get out of here.

706
01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:07.912
- Where the fuck is he going?
- What are you doing?

707
01:02:12.283 --> 01:02:13.771
Let me take it!

708
01:02:14.049 --> 01:02:16.879
- You can let go of it now.
- Are you crazy?

709
01:02:17.682 --> 01:02:20.945
Look at it. She looks better now.

710
01:02:23.017 --> 01:02:24.710
We got to get out of here.

711
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.239
We got to get the fuck out of here.

712
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:29.946
Leave it.

713
01:02:30.351 --> 01:02:33.408
What are you doing? Goddamn it!

714
01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.042
I don't understand what you want with it.

715
01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.673
- What are we doing with it?
- I want to examine it.

716
01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:42.750
- You make sure it's tied right.
- It's being tied right.

717
01:02:42.851 --> 01:02:46.874
- It's not gonna get loose, right?
- No, it's not gonna get loose.

718
01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:49.417
They're no stronger than humans.

719
01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:58.880
- Don't be afraid.
- I'll bust it in the damn head.

720
01:02:59.452 --> 01:03:01.351
You sure that thing's tied good?

721
01:03:02.952 --> 01:03:05.577
- You can hear me?
- Yes.

722
01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.282
Why do you eat people?

723
01:03:11.685 --> 01:03:15.015
Not people, brains.

724
01:03:15.119 --> 01:03:17.516
- Brains only?
- Yes.

725
01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:22.247
- Why?
- The pain.

726
01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:27.977
- What about the pain?
- The pain of being dead.

727
01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.045
It hurts to be dead.

728
01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:40.350
I can feel myself rot.

729
01:03:42.354 --> 01:03:44.082
Eating brains...

730
01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:47.519
how does that make you feel?

731
01:03:47.721 --> 01:03:50.051
It makes the pain...

732
01:03:50.554 --> 01:03:52.145
go away.

733
01:03:58.188 --> 01:04:02.484
Look, man, fuck this.
I got to talk to you. Now.

734
01:04:04.755 --> 01:04:07.347
Come on, I got to talk. We got to talk.

735
01:04:09.322 --> 01:04:11.447
Let's talk out in the hall.

736
01:04:17.022 --> 01:04:20.352
Look, how can we kill those things?

737
01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:22.153
You don't.

738
01:04:22.322 --> 01:04:24.015
What do you mean, "you don't"?

739
01:04:24.122 --> 01:04:26.385
You can't kill them, they're already dead.

740
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:29.081
They're not living creatures,
they're animated.

741
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:32.418
You can chop them up into pieces,
they'll still come after you.

742
01:04:32.522 --> 01:04:34.182
All you can do is burn them.

743
01:04:34.290 --> 01:04:37.881
You got to reduce them to ashes,
so there's nothing left to come after you.

744
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:40.081
How you gonna burn all those things?

745
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:44.849
- There's 100 of those fuckers.
- That is the question.

746
01:05:44.759 --> 01:05:46.622
We have a 10-32 from EMS.

747
01:05:46.726 --> 01:05:50.490
Two, repeat, two paramedic vehicles
missing in the East Piedmont district.

748
01:05:50.593 --> 01:05:52.389
Request a 10-51, Code 3.

749
01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:56.256
Available units near the 20,000 block
of East Central, please respond, over.

750
01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.922
Do you think they'll rescue us?

751
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.619
They better. That's all I got to say.

752
01:06:08.194 --> 01:06:10.354
But do you think they will?

753
01:06:18.761 --> 01:06:19.784
Chuck?

754
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.323
I never did like you.

755
01:06:25.128 --> 01:06:27.889
Oh, my God, hold me tight.

756
01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:32.392
I think it would be a lot wiser
if we contained Frank and Freddy.

757
01:06:32.496 --> 01:06:35.326
- You know what I'm saying?
- What do you mean, "contained"?

758
01:06:35.429 --> 01:06:39.293
Lock them up, so if they started
acting funny, they wouldn't hurt anybody.

759
01:06:39.396 --> 01:06:40.861
They don't want to hurt anybody.

760
01:06:40.962 --> 01:06:43.292
You bastard!
Why don't you lock yourselves up?

761
01:06:43.396 --> 01:06:46.487
We're not proposing doing
anything to them, for Christ's sake.

762
01:06:46.595 --> 01:06:50.323
We want to lock them up so we can
figure out how to get the hell out of here.

763
01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:52.691
Tina, that really is a good idea.

764
01:06:52.796 --> 01:06:56.523
- Where can we put them?
- Yeah, well, the chapel.

765
01:06:56.696 --> 01:06:59.288
All right, help me with Frank, please.

766
01:06:59.397 --> 01:07:01.363
- Lift his feet.
- Come on.

767
01:07:16.631 --> 01:07:17.961
On the rug.

768
01:07:20.265 --> 01:07:22.628
Lay them on the carpet, gently.

769
01:07:23.631 --> 01:07:24.824
Easy.

770
01:07:25.098 --> 01:07:28.030
Easy. It's all right. Can you hear me?

771
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:30.224
Boy, he's gone.

772
01:07:32.898 --> 01:07:34.159
Freddy.

773
01:07:35.366 --> 01:07:37.423
Let's just leave them and get out.

774
01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:41.294
- I'm not leaving Freddy.
- We got to lock the door, you know?

775
01:07:42.432 --> 01:07:43.556
I'm staying.

776
01:07:45.565 --> 01:07:47.724
Okay. Come on.

777
01:07:58.333 --> 01:08:01.787
Dispatch. This is Bravo 751.

778
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.525
We're at the mortuary.

779
01:08:03.633 --> 01:08:08.464
We see two, that is two, paramedic
vehicles parked in the rear parking lot.

780
01:08:08.766 --> 01:08:13.562
The doors on one vehicle are hanging open.
Stand by while we investigate. Over.

781
01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:39.729
I got a man down.

782
01:08:44.501 --> 01:08:45.626
Jesus!

783
01:08:49.102 --> 01:08:50.863
Hold it right there!

784
01:08:50.968 --> 01:08:53.934
Freeze or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

785
01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.359
This place...

786
01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:01.898
Everybody that comes in...

787
01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:03.933
gets swallowed up.

788
01:09:05.103 --> 01:09:06.898
Send more cops.

789
01:09:07.336 --> 01:09:08.302
What do we do?

790
01:09:08.403 --> 01:09:11.392
Stand here,
beating our meat till the corpses bust in?

791
01:09:11.502 --> 01:09:13.525
We can't stop them. We got to get out.

792
01:09:13.636 --> 01:09:14.727
We got to get to the cars.

793
01:09:14.836 --> 01:09:17.098
- There's corpses all over the cars.
- I know.

794
01:09:17.203 --> 01:09:18.566
What are you proposing?

795
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:22.103
What am I proposing?
I think we all should do some proposing.

796
01:09:22.204 --> 01:09:25.692
The crawlspace in the ceiling.
We could go up, barricade ourselves in.

797
01:09:25.803 --> 01:09:28.361
Only way up is the hatch,
and we could nail that shut.

798
01:09:28.471 --> 01:09:31.994
You must be out of your mind.
I'm not barricading myself in no roof.

799
01:09:32.104 --> 01:09:34.229
I'd rather take my chances with the cars.

800
01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.825
We need a way to fight them.

801
01:09:35.937 --> 01:09:37.426
How about this?

802
01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:39.128
What is that?

803
01:09:39.237 --> 01:09:42.204
It's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

804
01:09:42.305 --> 01:09:44.793
But there's not enough of it.

805
01:09:54.638 --> 01:09:56.264
It hurts!

806
01:09:58.071 --> 01:10:00.969
- It hurts more than you can imagine.
- I know.

807
01:10:05.306 --> 01:10:06.465
Freddy!

808
01:10:17.739 --> 01:10:19.602
I can finally see...

809
01:10:20.373 --> 01:10:21.998
the one thing...

810
01:10:23.007 --> 01:10:25.905
that can relieve this horrible suffering.

811
01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:27.632
What?

812
01:10:28.073 --> 01:10:30.335
Live brains!

813
01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:16.473
Get the girl!

814
01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:20.999
Run!

815
01:11:23.276 --> 01:11:24.935
Put her on the couch.

816
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:28.235
They got Freddy.

817
01:11:29.343 --> 01:11:31.740
It was horrible, ugly, man.

818
01:11:32.277 --> 01:11:34.868
His face was all fucked up.

819
01:11:37.643 --> 01:11:38.768
He's not Freddy.

820
01:11:38.876 --> 01:11:40.501
Brains.

821
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:45.569
Make her shut up.

822
01:11:47.411 --> 01:11:48.740
Brains.

823
01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:00.536
Shit, he's trying to get out.

824
01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:02.142
Get a bench, come on.

825
01:12:07.244 --> 01:12:08.835
Out of the way!

826
01:12:12.678 --> 01:12:15.838
Bring it against it. It's all right.

827
01:12:17.279 --> 01:12:19.574
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Get up!

828
01:12:20.412 --> 01:12:22.934
We can't stay here.
It's gonna bust through the door.

829
01:12:23.045 --> 01:12:24.738
We got to run for the cars.

830
01:12:25.778 --> 01:12:27.710
There's zombies all over the cars.

831
01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:30.778
Got to fight our way through them,
there's no other way.

832
01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:34.004
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

833
01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:36.045
That's a big fucking "if," man.

834
01:12:36.913 --> 01:12:39.970
I can't walk, much less run.

835
01:12:40.512 --> 01:12:42.308
How bad is your foot?

836
01:12:43.113 --> 01:12:44.806
It's broke.

837
01:12:55.214 --> 01:12:58.009
We get one of the cars,
bring it near the door.

838
01:12:58.114 --> 01:13:01.807
Police car. It should still have
the keys in the ignition.

839
01:13:01.947 --> 01:13:03.810
The motor is still running.

840
01:13:03.914 --> 01:13:06.472
- Good. I'll drive.
- No, I'll drive.

841
01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.841
Fuck you.

842
01:13:07.947 --> 01:13:11.005
When we drive up here,
I don't want to hang out there long.

843
01:13:11.115 --> 01:13:13.842
You stand right here.
Put one hand here and another here.

844
01:13:13.948 --> 01:13:15.971
When I say "now," you open the door fast.

845
01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:18.808
The minute we're through,
you slam it hard and lock it.

846
01:13:20.148 --> 01:13:22.773
Get your ass over here at the door.

847
01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:30.411
Burt...

848
01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:35.105
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

849
01:13:39.116 --> 01:13:40.412
All right, stand by.

850
01:13:45.049 --> 01:13:46.208
Now!

851
01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:15.010
You got to get closer. They can't make it.

852
01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.982
- We got to split.
- No, we can't split.

853
01:14:25.118 --> 01:14:27.175
They left us, those jerks!

854
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:29.914
They had to.

855
01:14:31.351 --> 01:14:33.010
Burt will send help.

856
01:14:33.751 --> 01:14:35.115
I know him.

857
01:14:35.652 --> 01:14:37.084
They left us.

858
01:14:38.618 --> 01:14:42.107
- What are you doing? We can't leave.
- They'd have turned the car over.

859
01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:43.310
We'll send help.

860
01:14:43.419 --> 01:14:47.044
- Those are my fucking friends back there.
- I said we'll send help.

861
01:14:47.152 --> 01:14:48.708
- Coward!
- Fuck you!

862
01:14:51.852 --> 01:14:53.148
Hang on, here we go!

863
01:14:55.052 --> 01:14:58.281
- What the fuck are we gonna do now?
- Find a phone, call the cops.

864
01:14:58.387 --> 01:15:01.012
- What the fuck?
- Jesus H. Christ!

865
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.145
Shit!

866
01:15:08.986 --> 01:15:10.679
Back to the warehouse!

867
01:15:21.121 --> 01:15:22.746
This way, you stupid honky!

868
01:15:23.187 --> 01:15:24.584
That's Spider.

869
01:15:28.553 --> 01:15:30.644
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

870
01:15:30.754 --> 01:15:32.913
- Who's he?
- He owns this place.

871
01:15:33.787 --> 01:15:35.413
That fucking car is totaled.

872
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:39.215
That's all right.
My car is still out there. So is Frank's.

873
01:15:41.155 --> 01:15:42.121
Not anymore.

874
01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:14.846
Tina!

875
01:16:19.689 --> 01:16:21.054
Where are you?

876
01:16:38.757 --> 01:16:40.087
Forgive me.

877
01:17:30.227 --> 01:17:33.624
Ground, this is Air 4, we got
a bad situation. We got officers down.

878
01:17:33.726 --> 01:17:35.919
We have just witnessed
ground units attacked.

879
01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.357
Helicopter!

880
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.988
Attention. This is the police.

881
01:17:42.093 --> 01:17:44.651
This area is under police blockade.

882
01:17:44.761 --> 01:17:48.319
All persons within this area wishing
to surrender should make their way...

883
01:17:48.428 --> 01:17:50.518
to the perimeter at once.

884
01:17:51.228 --> 01:17:52.387
Jesus.

885
01:17:52.994 --> 01:17:55.585
It sounds like the shit's
hitting the fan out there.

886
01:17:55.694 --> 01:17:58.490
- We got to let them know we're here.
- You better believe it.

887
01:17:58.594 --> 01:18:00.026
Hey, mister!

888
01:18:01.361 --> 01:18:02.656
Don't go in there.

889
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:05.659
There's a thing in there.
It ripped out the phone.

890
01:18:06.262 --> 01:18:07.818
There's another in the basement.

891
01:18:07.929 --> 01:18:10.259
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in there?

892
01:18:10.362 --> 01:18:12.487
- What do you mean?
- One of those corpses.

893
01:18:12.595 --> 01:18:15.153
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

894
01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:18.653
I don't care what's in the basement,
we got to get to that phone.

895
01:18:18.762 --> 01:18:21.785
Blinding them seems to work okay,
doesn't it?

896
01:18:22.995 --> 01:18:24.585
Wait a minute.

897
01:18:26.429 --> 01:18:30.885
Spider, open the door.
I'm going to knock his goddamn block off.

898
01:18:32.497 --> 01:18:36.792
It was wrong for you to lock me up.
I had to hurt myself to get out.

899
01:18:37.397 --> 01:18:39.454
But I forgive you, darling.

900
01:18:40.096 --> 01:18:42.119
And I know you're here...

901
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:45.089
because I can smell your brains.

902
01:18:46.497 --> 01:18:47.792
Go away!

903
01:18:47.897 --> 01:18:49.726
I'm coming up, Tina.

904
01:19:04.197 --> 01:19:06.628
Now you made me hurt myself again.

905
01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:10.655
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

906
01:19:12.299 --> 01:19:14.492
But I don't care, darling...

907
01:19:14.932 --> 01:19:16.693
because I love you.

908
01:19:17.499 --> 01:19:22.022
You've got to let me eat your brain.

909
01:19:34.599 --> 01:19:36.565
Open the goddamn door.

910
01:19:41.632 --> 01:19:43.064
Brains!

911
01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.559
Get him down.

912
01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:52.565
All right, you guys, go.
Get in there, come on, fast. Get in!

913
01:19:57.467 --> 01:19:59.330
Watch it, the step's out.

914
01:20:06.633 --> 01:20:08.395
Jesus Christ.

915
01:20:11.067 --> 01:20:13.829
That's our friend. The Tarman got him.

916
01:20:22.302 --> 01:20:23.858
Give me the police.

917
01:20:24.634 --> 01:20:26.100
It's an emergency, Operator.

918
01:20:27.101 --> 01:20:28.794
Captain, over here.

919
01:20:33.436 --> 01:20:35.697
- Yes, go ahead.
- You've got to help us.

920
01:20:35.802 --> 01:20:38.893
There's a bunch of us inside your barricade,
and we can't get out.

921
01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:41.593
First of all,
what the hell is going on in there?

922
01:20:41.702 --> 01:20:44.725
I lost a dozen good men,
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

923
01:20:44.835 --> 01:20:47.858
There are people in the cemetery
who are stark, staring mad.

924
01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:49.492
They'll kill you and eat you.

925
01:20:49.602 --> 01:20:52.160
It's like a disease, it's like rabies,
only faster.

926
01:20:52.269 --> 01:20:55.827
That's why you got to come in here
and get us out now. Please.

927
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:59.395
Just a minute, I can't hear.
There's a lot of noise out here.

928
01:20:59.503 --> 01:21:01.696
What the hell's going on?

929
01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:04.233
Halt! I said halt!

930
01:21:04.337 --> 01:21:06.235
- Watch it.
- They're crazy!

931
01:21:23.537 --> 01:21:25.470
- What?
- What is it?

932
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:30.996
They got the cops.

933
01:21:31.504 --> 01:21:35.096
That means they're breaking out
of the barricade. Jesus Christ.

934
01:21:42.205 --> 01:21:43.830
What's he doing?

935
01:21:45.005 --> 01:21:46.698
What are you doing?

936
01:21:53.772 --> 01:21:54.897
Hello?

937
01:21:56.072 --> 01:21:58.664
I'm calling the number
stenciled on the tank.

938
01:21:58.773 --> 01:22:01.739
- Your name, please?
- Burt Wilson.

939
01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:05.203
Stay on the line, Mr. Wilson.
You're being transferred.

940
01:22:05.307 --> 01:22:07.034
This is Com-Q, Denver, go ahead.

941
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:11.436
Denver, this is Wichita. I've got a
CLY priority on a 114. Who's up?

942
01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:14.505
That would be Col. Glover, San Diego.
I'll put you through.

943
01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:18.995
Yes?

944
01:22:20.374 --> 01:22:21.737
Yes, Captain.

945
01:22:23.241 --> 01:22:25.298
- I see. Very well.
- Horace.

946
01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:28.432
- Put the call through to me.
- What is it?

947
01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.768
Yes, put him on.

948
01:22:32.408 --> 01:22:35.203
Mr. Wilson, where are you calling from?

949
01:22:36.907 --> 01:22:39.567
I see. When did this take place?

950
01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:43.199
And when was the tank first breached?

951
01:22:44.142 --> 01:22:46.699
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

952
01:22:47.541 --> 01:22:50.735
I see. It's understandable.
What happened next?

953
01:22:53.942 --> 01:22:56.772
You did? And what effect did that have?

954
01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.637
What did you do then?

955
01:23:05.043 --> 01:23:06.804
And what did they do?

956
01:23:07.809 --> 01:23:08.968
I see.

957
01:23:11.176 --> 01:23:12.403
Really?

958
01:23:13.109 --> 01:23:14.938
How many did you say?

959
01:23:16.076 --> 01:23:19.338
And how many acres
does this cemetery cover, sir?

960
01:23:20.176 --> 01:23:21.267
Yes.

961
01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:23.569
I see.

962
01:23:25.377 --> 01:23:26.434
Yes, I see.

963
01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:29.668
Of course. Thank you
for your assistance, Mr. Wilson.

964
01:23:29.777 --> 01:23:32.572
I'll switch you back to Capt. Turner.
He'll talk to you.

965
01:24:03.078 --> 01:24:05.307
Sir, this is Col. Glover.

966
01:24:05.645 --> 01:24:09.509
I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour,
but we're at Q-2 status.

967
01:24:09.745 --> 01:24:13.609
It looks like we've found
that lost consignment of Easter eggs.

968
01:24:16.046 --> 01:24:19.603
Yes, sir, pretty sure.
They've turned up in Louisville.

969
01:24:19.712 --> 01:24:24.111
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

970
01:24:24.212 --> 01:24:26.202
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

971
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:32.174
It would be good news,
except that the eggs have hatched.

972
01:24:32.414 --> 01:24:33.936
What are they doing?

973
01:24:34.047 --> 01:24:35.774
Hang on a second, would you?

974
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:39.710
It's weird. These people seem to say
they've been waiting for this to happen.

975
01:24:39.813 --> 01:24:43.143
Apparently, they've got some sort of
contingency plan to deal with it.

976
01:24:43.247 --> 01:24:46.078
- That's great!
- What is this plan?

977
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:52.437
Sgt. Jefferson, 42nd Special
Mobile Artillery. Yes, sir.

978
01:24:52.814 --> 01:24:55.007
Good morning to you, too, sir.

979
01:24:55.981 --> 01:25:00.311
Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.
The code numbers please, sir.

980
01:25:00.415 --> 01:25:03.108
Archimedes. Hotdog. Rhubarb.

981
01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:06.179
Niner. Zero. Niner. Gotcha, sir.

982
01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:09.804
Bearing. Mark 2-2-0.

983
01:25:09.915 --> 01:25:12.279
Bearing, 2-2-0.

984
01:25:14.449 --> 01:25:17.313
Range. Mark 134 miles.

985
01:25:17.782 --> 01:25:20.408
Range, 1-3-4 miles.

986
01:25:35.849 --> 01:25:37.542
Hey, listen.

987
01:25:39.116 --> 01:25:40.547
You hear anything?

988
01:25:41.716 --> 01:25:43.307
Tina.

989
01:26:02.984 --> 01:26:04.779
Spectacular result, sir.

990
01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:07.413
Very close to optimal placement.

991
01:26:08.384 --> 01:26:10.907
Only 20 square blocks destroyed.

992
01:26:11.018 --> 01:26:12.916
Less than 4,000 dead, General.

993
01:26:13.018 --> 01:26:18.007
I wouldn't worry about the fires, General.
The rain is taking care of that right now.

994
01:26:18.419 --> 01:26:22.112
There have been complaints
about burning skin, but I shouldn't worry.

995
01:26:22.218 --> 01:26:26.082
Minor irritation, General.
The rain will wash everything away.

996
01:26:26.252 --> 01:26:29.740
That's correct, sir.
All should be back to normal by morning.

997
01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.250
I understand the President
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

998
01:26:33.353 --> 01:26:36.251
No, we wouldn't want that to happen, sir.

999
01:26:36.453 --> 01:26:39.385
No, this hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

1000
01:26:40.486 --> 01:26:42.678
Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir.

1001
01:26:57.987 --> 01:26:59.543
More brains!

1002
01:27:00.287 --> 01:27:03.810
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill it!

1003
01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:07.046
It's all over everything.

1004
01:27:07.154 --> 01:27:10.450
- Stupid asshole!
- Watch your tongue if you like this job.

1005
01:27:10.553 --> 01:27:11.644
Like this job?

1006
01:27:13.255 --> 01:27:14.982
Burt? Frank.

1007
01:27:15.554 --> 01:27:17.043
We have a little problem.

1008
01:27:20.754 --> 01:27:22.913
Do you ever fantasize...

1009
01:27:24.055 --> 01:27:25.419
about being killed?

1010
01:27:27.688 --> 01:27:30.916
- The brain!
- I hit the fucking brain.

1011
01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:34.050
- How do you kill something that's dead?
- How do I know?

1012
01:27:34.156 --> 01:27:36.849
- I don't know, let me think.
- It's not a bad question.

1013
01:27:36.956 --> 01:27:38.252
What do you think this is about?

1014
01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:41.617
You think this is a fuckin' costume?
This is a way of life!

1015
01:27:41.722 --> 01:27:44.745
- There's 100 of those fuckers.
- A hundred?

1016
01:27:45.022 --> 01:27:46.920
Brains!

1017
01:27:48.956 --> 01:27:50.649
Send more cops.

1018
01:27:51.789 --> 01:27:54.721
I think things are getting out of hand.

1019
01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:58.046
Get it off!

1020
01:28:01.123 --> 01:28:03.748
- It worked in the movie.
- It ain't working now.

1021
01:28:03.856 --> 01:28:05.515
You mean the movie lied?

1022
01:28:05.623 --> 01:28:07.816
It's not a bad question, Burt.
