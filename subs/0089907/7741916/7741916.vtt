00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:25.124
Hey, Frank! Let's
wrap it up and go home.

2
00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.457
What do you say?

3
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.541
Well, I got another
hour's work to do.

4
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.124
The kid's gonna stick with me,
and then I'll show him the ropes.

5
00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:33.082
Okay. You lock up for
me before you go?

6
00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:35.499
4th of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

7
00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:37.666
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, you have a nice 4th,

8
00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.832
and I'll see you Sunday
at the barbecue.

9
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:42.541
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

10
00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:45.749
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

11
00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:48.874
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

12
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.791
Take it easy, Frank.

13
00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:55.707
That Burt's a joker.

14
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.624
Ok, Freddy, follow me
and learn something.

15
00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:59.291
Okay.

16
00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:01.832
We got an order here from the St.
Louis University Medical School.

17
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.999
They want two adult female
skeletons with perfect teeth.

18
00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:07.791
That's a 2-AF-PT.

19
00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:09.791
Ok? So you come over
here to the "A" section.

20
00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:11.957
-That's "A" for adult, see?
-Okay.

21
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.249
Then that's divided up
into two sections.

22
00:01:14.332 --> 00:01:16.999
That's divided into the "M"
for male and the "F" for...

23
00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:18.916
-Female.
-Good boy.

24
00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:20.582
Now the "PT."

25
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.374
Suppose you think that's
"pretty tough”, but no, that's...

26
00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.249
-Perfect teeth.
-Very good.

27
00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:29.041
Now you get some excelsior over
there and lay it in that crate.

28
00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:32.291
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

29
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.291
Okay.

30
00:01:35.457 --> 00:01:37.582
Good work. We want
her to be comfortable.

31
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.749
Now help me get her in.
Grab her legs.

32
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:41.249
Okay.

33
00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:44.582
Now you get some of
that styrofoam popcorn,

34
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.916
spread it all around.

35
00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.124
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

36
00:01:50.207 --> 00:01:53.082
More, Freddy, more.
Ok, that's fine.

37
00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:55.874
Now spread it around.
That's right.

38
00:01:55.957 --> 00:01:58.541
-You're doing very nice work.
-Thanks.

39
00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.582
You're gonna be fine in the
warehouse business.

40
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.374
Where do we get all
these skeletons from?

41
00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:04.874
-Oh, they come from India.
-India?

42
00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.832
International treaty.
All skeletons come from India.

43
00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:09.249
No kidding. How come?

44
00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:10.874
How the hell do I know "how come"?

45
00:02:10.957 --> 00:02:12.791
The important question is,

46
00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:15.124
where do they get all the
skeletons with perfect teeth?

47
00:02:15.207 --> 00:02:17.124
I'm going to ask you a
serious question.

48
00:02:17.207 --> 00:02:19.291
How many people you know die

49
00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:22.749
with a beautiful, perfect set
of choppers in their puss, huh?

50
00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:24.416
Nobody I can think of.

51
00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.749
No. I think that there's a
skeleton farm over in India.

52
00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:29.957
Jesus!

53
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.249
Come on, kid.
Follow your uncle here.

54
00:02:33.332 --> 00:02:34.874
Here we go.

55
00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:36.832
I don't have to tell
you what these are for.

56
00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:38.374
Ba ba ba boom!

57
00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:42.416
Here we've got the prosthetic
devices, all around here.

58
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.624
Look under there. Wheelchairs.

59
00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:46.541
Right. These are great.

60
00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:48.082
Here's something you
don't see very often.

61
00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:50.082
You're a privileged person.

62
00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:53.707
These are split dogs.
Yep, for veterinarian schools.

63
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.624
Oh, we get a lot of
orders for split dogs.

64
00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:56.791
-That's really rad.
-Yeah.

65
00:02:56.874 --> 00:02:59.832
Don't fool around, you're learning.

66
00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:03.832
Over here, Freddy, is where
we keep the fresh cadavers.

67
00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:05.749
We sell these to medical schools

68
00:03:05.832 --> 00:03:08.457
and to the U.S. Army
for ballistic tests.

69
00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:16.332
Well, say hello.

70
00:03:25.332 --> 00:03:27.541
We usually got
more inventory than this,

71
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.582
but, ah, we're expecting
a shipment on Monday.

72
00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:34.999
H-how many bodies are in here usually?

73
00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.166
Well, you know, you don't
want to be overstocked.

74
00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.082
Kind of like the restaurant business,

75
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.624
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

76
00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:47.166
Tell you what I'll do, kid.

77
00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.499
Teach you how to fill
out these shipping forms.

78
00:03:51.582 --> 00:03:53.124
Look alive.

79
00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:00.874
-We gonna party tonight or what?
-Yeah, we are gonna party.

80
00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:02.332
Well, where?
Where we gonna party?

81
00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:05.041
-I don't know. Somewhere.
-Hey, we could go to the park.

82
00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:08.124
Oh, no, we can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

83
00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:09.749
And I ain't in no mood to die tonight.

84
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:11.249
I like death.

85
00:04:11.332 --> 00:04:13.124
I like death with sex.
How 'bout you, Casey?

86
00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:15.416
-You like sex with death?
-Yeah, so fuck off and die.

87
00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.999
So, when we gonna
party tonight, Tina?

88
00:04:17.082 --> 00:04:18.124
Oh you guys,
that'd be really rad,

89
00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:19.999
but I'm supposed to meet Freddy
when he gets off work.

90
00:04:20.082 --> 00:04:21.707
Yeah, where you
supposed to meet him?

91
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.374
At this medical supply warehouse
where he's working.

92
00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:25.707
Oh, no, he got a job?
What a dick.

93
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:27.416
Shit, why didn't you say so?

94
00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:29.499
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

95
00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:31.749
Freddy always knows where
there's a place to party.

96
00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:42.832
Frank?

97
00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.957
Yeah, kid?

98
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.291
What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

99
00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:49.832
Oh, kid,

100
00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:52.166
I have seen weird things come,

101
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.999
and I have seen weird things go.

102
00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:57.249
But the weirdest thing I ever saw

103
00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:59.416
just had to cap it all.

104
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.082
Oh, yeah? What's that?

105
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.207
Let me ask you a question, kid.

106
00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:09.874
Did you see that movie,
<i>Night of the Living Dead?</i>

107
00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.832
Yeah, yeah, that's the
one where the corpses

108
00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:13.124
start eating the people, right?

109
00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:15.374
Sure. Wh-what about it?

110
00:05:15.457 --> 00:05:18.957
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

111
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.541
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

112
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:24.166
I've never been more serious in my life.

113
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.457
That's not possible.

114
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:29.291
I mean, they showed
zombies taking over the world.

115
00:05:29.374 --> 00:05:33.291
They changed it all around.
What really happened was

116
00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:37.416
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the V.A. hospital,

117
00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:39.582
there was a chemical spill

118
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.999
and all that stuff

119
00:05:42.082 --> 00:05:44.832
kinda leaked down into the morgue

120
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.082
and it made all the dead bodies

121
00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:49.249
kinda jump around as
though it was alive.

122
00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:50.791
What chemical?

123
00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:53.749
2-4-5-Trioxin,
it's called.

124
00:05:53.832 --> 00:05:57.124
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something.

125
00:05:57.207 --> 00:05:59.249
And the Darrow Chemical Company

126
00:05:59.332 --> 00:06:01.416
was trying to develop it
for the Army.

127
00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.999
And they told the guy who
made the movie

128
00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:09.082
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

129
00:06:09.166 --> 00:06:12.416
So he changed all the
facts around.

130
00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.749
So what really happened?

131
00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:17.874
Well, they closed it all down, see,

132
00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:21.582
and the Army shipped all
that contaminated dirt

133
00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:24.666
and all those dead bodies out.

134
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:27.624
And they kept it a secret. Shh.

135
00:06:28.582 --> 00:06:29.832
What...

136
00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:32.416
So how come you know about it?

137
00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:35.541
A typical Army fuck up.

138
00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:39.416
The Transportation Department
got the orders crossed,

139
00:06:40.624 --> 00:06:44.041
and they shipped those bodies here

140
00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:47.124
instead of to the
Darrow Chemical Company.

141
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:53.749
Hello?

142
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:55.791
Oh, hi, honey.

143
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.874
Uh, no, I'll be home in
about an hour.

144
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:00.332
You keep the, uh,
pot roast hot, okay?

145
00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:05.416
Yeah, sure, I love you,
too, honey. Yeah. Kiss, kiss.

146
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.416
Wanna see them?

147
00:07:14.332 --> 00:07:17.124
-See them?
-The corpses.

148
00:07:19.457 --> 00:07:21.124
What are you talking about?

149
00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.249
-They're down in the basement.
-No.

150
00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:27.541
-Come on.
-No way.

151
00:07:33.457 --> 00:07:36.457
Hey, mind the third step.
It's a bitch.

152
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:38.457
You mean, they just brought
those bodies here and left them?

153
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.207
Well, you know the Army.

154
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:42.124
And they've been here
all this time?

155
00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.166
14 years, as I recall.

156
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:48.082
No kidding?

157
00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:51.832
There they are.

158
00:07:52.957 --> 00:07:54.749
There's bodies in there?

159
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:16.207
Oh, shit. Look at that.

160
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:19.457
-You say that thing was alive?
-So they say.

161
00:08:25.582 --> 00:08:27.041
Oh, God.

162
00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:30.291
-Hey, these things don't leak, do they?
-Leak? Hell, no.

163
00:08:30.374 --> 00:08:33.707
These things were made by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

164
00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:37.457
Oh, fuck!

165
00:11:18.249 --> 00:11:20.541
Hello, dear. How was your day?

166
00:11:20.624 --> 00:11:22.041
The usual, crap.

167
00:11:22.124 --> 00:11:23.791
Oh, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:25.166
What's for dinner?

169
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:27.291
Your favorite, lamb chops.

170
00:11:27.374 --> 00:11:29.124
I had them for lunch.

171
00:11:50.082 --> 00:11:53.124
Yes, it's me, checking in
from Station 3 at 1600--

172
00:11:53.207 --> 00:11:55.457
uh, make that 1601 hours.

173
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:57.707
I'll be home all evening. Right.

174
00:12:11.666 --> 00:12:15.332
It's nerve-racking to live around
that equipment all the time.

175
00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:18.624
They have to be able to reach
me 24 hours a day, wherever I am.

176
00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:19.707
You know that.

177
00:12:19.791 --> 00:12:22.041
All that microwave
stuff affects my oven.

178
00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:24.416
When we find them, you can
have the equipment taken out.

179
00:12:24.499 --> 00:12:26.166
But when will you find them?

180
00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:28.416
Christ, Ethel, I don't know!

181
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:31.707
Maybe we'll never find them.

182
00:12:36.416 --> 00:12:38.374
Look, we've been
through all this before.

183
00:12:38.457 --> 00:12:40.291
They could be anywhere.

184
00:12:46.916 --> 00:12:48.332
Where the fuck we going, anyway?

185
00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:50.832
-To party!
-To pick up Freddy.

186
00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:52.541
Oh, yeah, what the fuck is
Freddy up to these days, anyway?

187
00:12:52.624 --> 00:12:54.957
-He got himself a job.
-Oh, no shit? What job?

188
00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.666
-He's a stockroom clerk.
-Yeah? That sounds like a shitty job.

189
00:12:57.749 --> 00:12:59.374
Well, it isn't the President
of the United States,

190
00:12:59.457 --> 00:13:01.207
but at least he makes
money to buy stuff.

191
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:03.124
Oh, yeah, maybe he'll
buy something from me?

192
00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:05.249
He don't like your
kind of stuff, Suicide.

193
00:13:05.332 --> 00:13:07.999
How come you guys only come 'round
when you need a ride someplace?

194
00:13:08.082 --> 00:13:10.082
'Cause you one spooky
motherfucker, Suicide.

195
00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.291
Oh, you think I'm spooky, huh?
What the fuck!

196
00:13:24.749 --> 00:13:27.166
Man, what a hideous, ugly place.

197
00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:30.582
-I like it. It's a statement.
-Come on, let's go get the prick.

198
00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:32.707
-No.
-Why not?

199
00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:35.541
-You might freak out his boss.
-Well, that's not nice.

200
00:13:35.624 --> 00:13:38.374
Yeah, what does he think
we are, weird or something?

201
00:13:38.457 --> 00:13:40.707
-What time does Freddy get off?
-10:00.

202
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:42.541
I ain't sittin' here two
fuckin' hours.

203
00:13:42.624 --> 00:13:44.457
We could always go drive around.

204
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:46.624
I don't got gas.
You wanna buy some gas, idiot?

205
00:13:46.707 --> 00:13:48.041
I was kidding.

206
00:13:48.082 --> 00:13:49.707
We could go fool around
in there for a while.

207
00:13:49.749 --> 00:13:52.124
You mean that cemetery? Ahh.

208
00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.874
Oh, let's do that.

209
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:14.832
What do you want to do, Scuz,
turn over gravestones?

210
00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:17.041
No, I just want to look
around the graveyard.

211
00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:18.874
I ain't never seen one before.

212
00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:20.541
Ain't you never been to a funeral?

213
00:14:20.624 --> 00:14:22.124
I never knew nobody that died.

214
00:14:22.207 --> 00:14:24.041
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

215
00:14:24.124 --> 00:14:26.207
-What's that?
-Road flares, as swipe.

216
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:28.874
-What do you want those?
-I just want to party.

217
00:14:28.957 --> 00:14:30.916
What are the road flares for?

218
00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:44.749
This place is a mess.

219
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:50.416
This looks like your pad, Scuz.

220
00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:51.999
I heard that.

221
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:06.832
Frank?

222
00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:26.124
Are you okay, kid?

223
00:15:26.957 --> 00:15:29.249
I don't know. I don't--
I don't feel so good.

224
00:15:30.124 --> 00:15:31.916
Christ, what a stink.

225
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:38.041
What the hell
happened to the body?

226
00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:40.707
It must have melted
when it hit the air.

227
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.749
Close the goddamn thing.

228
00:15:53.707 --> 00:15:56.416
Christ, I never smelled
anything like that before.

229
00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:01.666
I think I'm gonna be sick.

230
00:16:21.874 --> 00:16:24.457
Listen, I don't guess we'd
better tell Burt about this.

231
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:26.499
It makes us look stupid
or something.

232
00:16:26.582 --> 00:16:28.457
I can still smell that stuff.

233
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:30.874
It must be in my nose,
either that or it's all over everything.

234
00:16:30.957 --> 00:16:34.374
Yeah, I'd better spray
some deodorant around here.

235
00:16:45.416 --> 00:16:46.749
Oh.

236
00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:50.041
What was that?

237
00:16:52.082 --> 00:16:54.791
-Sounds like a dog.
-A dog?

238
00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:57.666
Wait a second. Listen. Listen.

239
00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:00.041
You hear that?

240
00:17:00.124 --> 00:17:02.124
What the hell's going on here?

241
00:17:14.749 --> 00:17:16.291
What's wrong with him?

242
00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:22.041
Oh, shit!

243
00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:23.791
What are we gonna do?

244
00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:26.082
We're gonna kill it!

245
00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:27.374
We're gonna kill it!

246
00:17:29.374 --> 00:17:31.541
What are you doing? Stop!

247
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:37.332
Aah!

248
00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:39.166
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

249
00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:43.749
Are we fucked? What's happening?

250
00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:46.666
It's the cadaver! The cadaver!

251
00:17:46.749 --> 00:17:49.791
-What's it doing in there?
-I don't know. It sounds sore!

252
00:17:49.874 --> 00:17:51.541
Well, what are we going to do?

253
00:17:51.624 --> 00:17:53.707
-Lock it in.
-Yeah! Yeah!

254
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:55.041
Oh, Jesus!

255
00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.166
Hurry! Jesus Christ!

256
00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.666
We gotta think! We gotta think!

257
00:18:01.749 --> 00:18:03.707
Come on, son, get in there!

258
00:18:04.499 --> 00:18:05.916
Oh, Jesus Christ!

259
00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:08.374
Are we going crazy?

260
00:18:08.457 --> 00:18:10.082
No, it's that crap from the tanks.

261
00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:12.874
The goddamn chemicals,
it's all over everything.

262
00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:14.499
Stupid asshole!

263
00:18:14.582 --> 00:18:16.374
Watch your tongue, boy,
if you like this job.

264
00:18:16.457 --> 00:18:17.541
Like this job?

265
00:18:17.624 --> 00:18:20.374
-Think! Think!
-We gotta call the cops.

266
00:18:20.457 --> 00:18:21.874
No, you don't want to
call the cops.

267
00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:23.666
You know what they'd do
to this company?

268
00:18:23.749 --> 00:18:26.374
-Who cares about the company?
-Well, think of our reputation!

269
00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:27.499
Fuck your reputation.

270
00:18:27.582 --> 00:18:28.874
Think! Think!

271
00:18:28.957 --> 00:18:31.041
What about the number
on the side of the tank?

272
00:18:31.124 --> 00:18:33.624
The one that said to,
“Call in case of an emergency.”

273
00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:35.207
No, that's the Army.

274
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:38.082
You don't want the goddamn
Army around this place.

275
00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:40.374
-Think!
-Well, what are we gonna do?

276
00:18:40.457 --> 00:18:43.749
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna call the boss.

277
00:18:56.916 --> 00:18:59.041
Burt? Frank.

278
00:18:59.124 --> 00:19:00.541
We have a little problem.

279
00:19:03.249 --> 00:19:05.416
Do you ever fantasize

280
00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:08.707
about being killed?

281
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:10.499
Never.

282
00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.249
Do you ever wonder

283
00:19:12.332 --> 00:19:15.707
about all the different ways of dying,

284
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:17.957
you know, violently

285
00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:19.582
and wonder, like,

286
00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:23.249
what would be the most
horrible way to die?

287
00:19:23.332 --> 00:19:25.916
I try not to think about
dying too much.

288
00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:26.957
Mmm.

289
00:19:27.957 --> 00:19:29.624
Well, for me

290
00:19:30.791 --> 00:19:32.541
the worst way

291
00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:36.666
would be for a bunch of old men

292
00:19:36.749 --> 00:19:38.624
to get around me

293
00:19:39.249 --> 00:19:41.416
and start biting

294
00:19:41.499 --> 00:19:43.874
and eating me alive.

295
00:19:43.957 --> 00:19:45.291
I see.

296
00:19:45.666 --> 00:19:47.166
First,

297
00:19:47.249 --> 00:19:50.707
they would tear off my clothes.

298
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:52.332

299
00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:54.582

You opened it? You stupid moron.

318
00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:39.791
You idiot. What's the
matter with you, Frank?

319
00:20:39.874 --> 00:20:41.749
Haven't I always told
you never to even

320
00:20:41.832 --> 00:20:43.374
go near those goddamn tanks?

321
00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:46.666
What are we gonna do, Burt?

322
00:20:46.749 --> 00:20:47.791
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

323
00:20:47.874 --> 00:20:49.582
I'm gonna be sued by the
Darrow Chemical Company,

324
00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:51.416
I'm gonna be investigated
by the government.

325
00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:53.707
I might become famous, Frank,
I might even lose my business.

326
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:55.624
I might even go to jail,
goddamn it.

327
00:20:55.707 --> 00:20:57.291
That's what I'm gonna do.

328
00:21:02.499 --> 00:21:06.124
On the other hand, we destroy
all this evidence around here

329
00:21:06.207 --> 00:21:07.541
and we keep our mouths shut.

330
00:21:07.624 --> 00:21:10.332
That's it! Let's do that, Burt!

331
00:21:10.666 --> 00:21:13.832
Yeah, Frank, you're right.
That's what we got to do.

332
00:21:14.541 --> 00:21:16.416
One question, Frank.

333
00:21:16.499 --> 00:21:19.957
This guy screaming in here,
you're sure he's a dead cadaver?

334
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:22.457
Why don't you open
the door and find out?

335
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:24.832
No, that's all right, Frank.
I'll take your word for that.

336
00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:28.832
If it is a reanimated body, we're
going-- we'll have to kill it.

337
00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.791
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

338
00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:34.541
Well, how do I know, Fred?
I don't know, let me think.

339
00:21:34.624 --> 00:21:36.916
It's not a bad question, Burt.

340
00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:39.207
In that movie, they destroyed
the brain to kill them.

341
00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:41.957
-Is that what they did?
-The brain, right. Yeah.

342
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:45.457
What do doctors use
to crack skulls with?

343
00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.124
-Surgical drills.
-Here, hold this, Frank.

344
00:21:48.207 --> 00:21:49.791
Now listen to me,
both of you, very carefully.

345
00:21:49.874 --> 00:21:51.374
Freddy, you're gonna
open that door.

346
00:21:51.457 --> 00:21:54.249
Come here, you stand right
over here. Frank, right here.

347
00:21:54.332 --> 00:21:56.207
When it comes out,
you brain it with that axe.

348
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:57.707
Oh, Jesus!

349
00:21:57.791 --> 00:21:59.957
Well, how am I gonna
stop it from moaning?

350
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:01.624
What's the matter with you, Frank?

351
00:22:01.707 --> 00:22:04.291
Fred, come here. Get down
there. Please, stand by the door.

352
00:22:04.374 --> 00:22:06.082
It's gonna be all right, son.

353
00:22:06.166 --> 00:22:08.332
I don't think I can do this, Burt.

354
00:22:08.416 --> 00:22:10.457
Well, you damn well better.
You got us into this.

355
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:12.166
Oh, Jesus!

356
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:15.707
All right, Freddy. 22, right.

357
00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:20.666
Oh!

358
00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:22.666
Be brave, Frank, goddamn it!

359
00:22:23.499 --> 00:22:24.957
4, left.

360
00:22:27.624 --> 00:22:29.332
10, right.

361
00:22:39.707 --> 00:22:41.416
Aah!

362
00:22:44.124 --> 00:22:45.499
Get him off, Frank!

363
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:47.249
Aah!

364
00:23:00.332 --> 00:23:01.916
Coming for it, Frank.

365
00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:03.624
Hold it!

366
00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:05.082
Aah!

367
00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:07.082
Oh!

368
00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:09.707
Oh! Oh!

369
00:23:09.749 --> 00:23:11.749
What the hell's going on, Burt?

370
00:23:11.832 --> 00:23:13.791
The brain! The brain!

371
00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:15.249
I hit the fucking brain!

372
00:23:15.332 --> 00:23:19.207
Then do something else, for
goddamn-it-to-hell's sake.

373
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:21.624
Hold him down, Frank.

374
00:23:21.707 --> 00:23:25.166
I can't stand this any longer.

375
00:23:25.249 --> 00:23:27.707
-Oh, shit!
-Hold him down, now, hold him down,

376
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:30.374
What are you gonna do? Oh!

377
00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:35.457
Be a man, Frank! Be a man!

378
00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.541
I can't stand this, you son of a bitch.

379
00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.707
Hurry up!

380
00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:46.624
Oh, no!

381
00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:02.791
-I'll get him!
-Get him!

382
00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:05.332
-I got him.
-Get a rope!

383
00:24:05.416 --> 00:24:06.874
Where the fuck's a rope?

384
00:24:06.957 --> 00:24:08.707
I don't know.
Get one. Hold him down!

385
00:24:08.791 --> 00:24:10.041
- Are you hanging on?
- Got him!

386
00:24:10.124 --> 00:24:11.791
Hang on to the son of a bitch!

387
00:24:11.874 --> 00:24:13.832
Christ, it ain't dying.

388
00:24:13.916 --> 00:24:16.874
I thought you said if we
destroyed the brain, it'd die!

389
00:24:16.957 --> 00:24:19.582
-It worked in the movie.
-Well, it ain't working now, Frank.

390
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:21.374
You mean the movie lied?

391
00:24:21.457 --> 00:24:22.999
Oh, Jesus.

392
00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:25.457
Ah!

393
00:24:28.124 --> 00:24:29.749
How are we gonna kill it?

394
00:24:29.791 --> 00:24:32.082
Maybe you can't kill it.
Maybe it won't die.

395
00:24:35.957 --> 00:24:37.749
Then we just got to
destroy it completely

396
00:24:37.832 --> 00:24:39.166
until there's nothing left.

397
00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:40.666
Acid.

398
00:24:40.749 --> 00:24:43.041
What kind of acid would
dissolve a body?

399
00:24:43.082 --> 00:24:44.582
Sulfuric acid, maybe.

400
00:24:44.666 --> 00:24:47.874
No, no, aqua regia,
that's stronger.

401
00:24:47.957 --> 00:24:50.457
But what if it doesn't dissolve
everything, like the bones?

402
00:24:52.416 --> 00:24:53.749
Shit!

403
00:24:54.999 --> 00:24:56.999
What are we gonna do?

404
00:24:58.416 --> 00:24:59.707
Burt?

405
00:25:00.124 --> 00:25:01.666
Where are you going?

406
00:25:04.666 --> 00:25:07.416
Sometimes Ernie Kaltenbrunner
works late on Friday nights.

407
00:25:07.499 --> 00:25:09.291
Well, who's Ernie Kaltenbrunner?

408
00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:12.124
He's the embalmer at the
mortuary across the street.

409
00:25:12.207 --> 00:25:14.082
What the hell's
he gonna do for us?

410
00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:15.957
His light's on. He's in.

411
00:25:18.749 --> 00:25:20.999
Ernie's got a crematorium
across the street, Frank.

412
00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:23.707
A crematorium, that's beautiful.

413
00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:25.957
You think you can get
him to go along with it?

414
00:25:26.041 --> 00:25:28.082
I don't know. I've known
Ernie about 25 years.

415
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:30.041
He might do it out of
friendship. I'm not sure.

416
00:25:30.124 --> 00:25:32.332
Yeah, but what the hell
are you gonna tell him?

417
00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.957
I mean, can you trust that bastard?

418
00:25:35.041 --> 00:25:37.916
I don't think we have a choice, Frank.

419
00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:40.791
How we--how we gonna get
this thing over there?

420
00:25:47.416 --> 00:25:49.291
Give me the bone saw.

421
00:25:53.291 --> 00:25:56.124
Why don't you put your
clothes on? The show's over.

422
00:25:56.207 --> 00:25:59.166
What's the matter?
does it make you nervous?

423
00:26:00.374 --> 00:26:01.832
I'm hot.

424
00:26:02.832 --> 00:26:04.791
Yeah. You are hot.

425
00:26:04.874 --> 00:26:06.374
Scram, wimp.

426
00:26:12.499 --> 00:26:14.832
Nobody understands me,
you know that?

427
00:26:14.916 --> 00:26:17.999
I fuckin' bust my ass for
you guys, and what do I get?

428
00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:20.166
"You're spooky."

429
00:26:20.249 --> 00:26:22.457
Fuck you, man. Fuck you all.

430
00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:25.041
I like it spooky.

431
00:26:25.124 --> 00:26:26.957
I mean, I got somethin'
to say, you know?

432
00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:28.791
What do you think this is all about?

433
00:26:28.874 --> 00:26:30.749
You think this is a fuckin' costume?

434
00:26:30.832 --> 00:26:32.457
This is a way of life!

435
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.166
Oh, yes.

436
00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:38.124
Hey, what's wrong with you, man?

437
00:26:38.207 --> 00:26:40.957
Show some fucking respect
for the dead, will ya?

438
00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:47.041
-Hey, is that Freddy?
-Where?

439
00:26:47.124 --> 00:26:48.791
Over there,
going in the building.

440
00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:51.082
Nope. That is not Freddy.

441
00:26:51.791 --> 00:26:53.249
How would you know?

442
00:26:53.332 --> 00:26:56.124
Because. Why would Freddy
be going into a mortuary?

443
00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.249
Damn!

444
00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.749
What do you say, Ernie?

445
00:27:55.666 --> 00:27:56.874
Hey, Ernie.

446
00:27:57.416 --> 00:27:58.749
Whoa!

447
00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:01.041
-Take it easy.
-Sorry, I didn't hear you.

448
00:28:02.291 --> 00:28:03.916
Fast on the draw.

449
00:28:04.374 --> 00:28:05.332
Whew.

450
00:28:06.707 --> 00:28:08.374
You are working late tonight.

451
00:28:08.457 --> 00:28:11.666
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Pretty much. Kind of...

452
00:28:11.749 --> 00:28:14.457
What time is it?
You want a cup of coffee?

453
00:28:14.541 --> 00:28:16.291
Uh, no. No, thank you. I'm all right.

454
00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:17.999
I do, and I need it.

455
00:28:21.707 --> 00:28:24.957
What, uh, what are-- what
are you doing there, Ernie?

456
00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:27.124
Breaking out the rigor mortis.

457
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:28.291
Oh, yeah?

458
00:28:29.582 --> 00:28:30.916
Come here.

459
00:28:31.457 --> 00:28:33.457
-Huh?
-Come on.

460
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:36.499
You see, rigor mortis
starts in the brain.

461
00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:39.082
And it spreads down
to the internal organs,

462
00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:41.499
and it finally settles in the muscles.

463
00:28:43.791 --> 00:28:45.332
It, uh,

464
00:28:45.416 --> 00:28:48.082
loosens up after a while,
but, uh, you can, uh,

465
00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:52.291
you can break it out
manually, as they say

466
00:28:52.374 --> 00:28:55.249
by flexing the muscles. See that?

467
00:28:55.332 --> 00:28:56.291
Yeah.

468
00:28:56.374 --> 00:28:58.457
You'll not find that
in a book, my friend.

469
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:02.416
The embalming business is basically
passed on by word of mouth.

470
00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:06.082
I'll tell you, that's fascinating,
Ernie, that's really something.

471
00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:12.541
Well, he's dead now.
And |I am bushed.

472
00:29:16.374 --> 00:29:19.332
Hey, uh, buddy boy. Uh,

473
00:29:19.416 --> 00:29:22.374
how long we been friends,
Ernie? About how long? About...

474
00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:26.957
-25 years, give or take.
-Yeah.

475
00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:30.791
Uh, if I ask you a favor,
could you keep it quiet?

476
00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:32.624
Sure. What is it?

477
00:29:32.707 --> 00:29:34.582
Well, I'm gonna need
some help, Ernie,

478
00:29:34.666 --> 00:29:37.249
in a pretty big way, really.

479
00:29:37.332 --> 00:29:39.666
You can depend on me.
Why? What's wrong?

480
00:29:39.749 --> 00:29:43.957
Uh, I got a couple of my men out
here, y-you mind if I let them in?

481
00:29:44.041 --> 00:29:46.124
B-Burt, that's illegal.

482
00:29:46.207 --> 00:29:48.332
You can bring it on in now, please.

483
00:29:48.416 --> 00:29:51.957
Fred, you can put it right
over here. Right here.

484
00:29:55.124 --> 00:29:56.457
What is that?

485
00:30:00.207 --> 00:30:01.291
Right there, please.

486
00:30:01.374 --> 00:30:02.541
-Here?
-Yeah.

487
00:30:11.416 --> 00:30:12.749
I got to...

488
00:30:13.249 --> 00:30:14.457
Yeah.

489
00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:19.332
What the hell is in those bags?

490
00:30:20.666 --> 00:30:22.874
-Rabid weasels.
-What?

491
00:30:22.957 --> 00:30:25.166
What the hell are you
doing with rabid weasels?

492
00:30:25.249 --> 00:30:27.874
I was trying to explain it to
you. They came as a shipment.

493
00:30:27.957 --> 00:30:29.832
'Course, they weren't
supposed to be rabid,

494
00:30:29.916 --> 00:30:31.791
you know, but you know
how these things happen.

495
00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:33.374
No, I don't. How do they happen?

496
00:30:33.457 --> 00:30:35.249
Watch out! Watch out,
Ernie. Don't get bit.

497
00:30:35.332 --> 00:30:36.374
Yeah.

498
00:30:36.457 --> 00:30:38.624
Anyway, we got them,
and we need your help.

499
00:30:38.707 --> 00:30:39.957
How?

500
00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:41.916
We got to get rid of these things.

501
00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:44.457
Well, why don't you
call an animal shelter?

502
00:30:44.541 --> 00:30:46.374
Well, word'd get out,
hurt my business.

503
00:30:46.457 --> 00:30:48.374
You know, that's a
bad scene, rabies.

504
00:30:48.457 --> 00:30:49.791
I don't think so.

505
00:30:49.874 --> 00:30:52.707
I mean, so what?
You don't run a pet store.

506
00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:54.791
So, some lab animals got rabies.

507
00:30:54.874 --> 00:30:57.749
Come on, guys,
take them to the pound.

508
00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:00.457
Well, I just can't do that.

509
00:31:00.541 --> 00:31:02.499
You got to--you got to
take my word for it.

510
00:31:04.332 --> 00:31:06.082
What the hell do you
want me to do?

511
00:31:06.166 --> 00:31:08.999
-You have a crematorium, right?
-You wanna burn them?

512
00:31:09.082 --> 00:31:10.874
Yeah, that's what I
had in mind, actually.

513
00:31:10.957 --> 00:31:12.457
That's cruel.

514
00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:13.999
I can't think of anything else to do.

515
00:31:14.082 --> 00:31:17.499
Y-y-you just can't
burn animals alive.

516
00:31:17.582 --> 00:31:19.291
It's just too hideous.

517
00:31:19.374 --> 00:31:21.082
At least let me kill them first.

518
00:31:21.166 --> 00:31:23.791
Take 'em out in the parking lot,
and put 'em out of their misery.

519
00:31:25.707 --> 00:31:28.374
I don't think that'd work, Ernie.

520
00:31:28.457 --> 00:31:31.124
I don't—I don't u-understand
what's going on. W-Why not?

521
00:31:37.791 --> 00:31:39.791
Can you swear to keep a secret, Ernie?

522
00:31:39.874 --> 00:31:41.791
At this point, I don't know.

523
00:31:41.874 --> 00:31:43.374
No, no, y-you got to swear.

524
00:31:43.457 --> 00:31:45.541
You got to, or I
just-- I can't tell you.

525
00:31:45.624 --> 00:31:48.499
All right, I swear.

526
00:31:48.582 --> 00:31:49.999
Good.

527
00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:56.416
It's not weasels in the bags.

528
00:31:58.124 --> 00:32:00.207
No. No kidding. Look here.

529
00:32:10.124 --> 00:32:11.207
Oh!

530
00:32:11.291 --> 00:32:12.499
Get it off!

531
00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:13.999
Get it off!

532
00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:16.374
Get it off! Get it off!

533
00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.249
Frank!

534
00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:26.666
I'm sorry, Ernie.

535
00:32:26.749 --> 00:32:29.166
No, it's all right.

536
00:32:35.249 --> 00:32:37.124
Ernie, we got a...

537
00:32:38.666 --> 00:32:40.791
We got a long story to tell you.

538
00:32:40.874 --> 00:32:42.957
Oh, great. Some party.

539
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:45.416
What happened to Trash and Suicide?

540
00:32:45.499 --> 00:32:47.832
Probably getting it on somewhere.

541
00:32:49.332 --> 00:32:51.999
Don't even think it, Chuck.

542
00:32:52.082 --> 00:32:54.791
Oh, God, when's 10:00
gonna come?

543
00:32:54.874 --> 00:32:57.832
Hey, if you wanna split,
we could both go somewhere.

544
00:32:59.832 --> 00:33:03.249
You'd really like to do
it with me, wouldn't you?

545
00:33:03.332 --> 00:33:05.666
Hey, I mean, a girl like
you and a guy like me.

546
00:33:06.457 --> 00:33:08.249
Go choke a chicken.

547
00:33:08.332 --> 00:33:11.416
Oh, come on, Casey.
I was only kidding, for sure.

548
00:33:11.499 --> 00:33:13.624
Oh, great, here's your
friend and mine.

549
00:33:13.707 --> 00:33:15.707
Hey, fuck you, ball buster.

550
00:33:17.832 --> 00:33:20.332
Hey, my watch stopped.
What time is it?

551
00:33:26.666 --> 00:33:28.041
Going on 10:00.

552
00:33:28.082 --> 00:33:30.166
Oh, fudge. I'd better
get over and find Freddy.

553
00:33:30.249 --> 00:33:32.249
He's gonna be getting
off any time now.

554
00:33:32.332 --> 00:33:33.791
OK. Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

555
00:33:33.874 --> 00:33:35.999
-Don't go anywhere, okay?
-All right.

556
00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:39.082
Come on, Freddy, where are you?

557
00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:40.457
Frankly, Burt,

558
00:34:40.541 --> 00:34:43.249
I think you acted precipitously
in cutting up the corpse.

559
00:34:43.332 --> 00:34:46.041
Well, you may be right,
I don't know, but I did it.

560
00:34:46.124 --> 00:34:48.374
So what--what are we
gonna do about it, Ernie?

561
00:34:50.249 --> 00:34:53.541
If I let you use the crematorium,
what's in it for me?

562
00:34:55.624 --> 00:34:57.249
What do you want?

563
00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:00.624
Well, uh,

564
00:35:00.707 --> 00:35:03.332
the way I see it,
this is a pretty big favor.

565
00:35:03.416 --> 00:35:05.499
Well, Ernie, you got it!
Whatever it is you want,

566
00:35:05.582 --> 00:35:07.916
so help me, I'll--
I'll do it. I promise.

567
00:35:11.416 --> 00:35:13.166
I'm sorry about that.

568
00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:38.957
All right. Let's take
care of your problem.

569
00:35:47.582 --> 00:35:49.124
Yes siree,

570
00:35:49.207 --> 00:35:50.957
you're gonna owe me a big one.

571
00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:53.791
Now buddy-boy, you go get rid of
everything for me. Nothing left.

572
00:35:53.874 --> 00:35:56.124
-Is that right?
-Everything'll go.

573
00:36:00.499 --> 00:36:02.291
What about the bones?

574
00:36:02.374 --> 00:36:03.707
Bones are no problem.

575
00:36:04.582 --> 00:36:06.541
The hardest thing to burn
is the heart.

576
00:36:07.041 --> 00:36:08.916
The heart? Why?

577
00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:11.041
'Cause it's just one big,
tough muscle.

578
00:36:11.124 --> 00:36:13.582
Yeah, but Ernie, I
mean, come on. We don't--

579
00:36:13.666 --> 00:36:15.416
We don't want the heart
sticking around.

580
00:36:15.499 --> 00:36:17.332
Then I'll turn it up
hotter for the heart.

581
00:36:17.416 --> 00:36:19.374
And what about the split dogs?
They got to go, too.

582
00:36:19.457 --> 00:36:21.582
The split dogs will go, too.

583
00:36:25.124 --> 00:36:27.874
Come on, just give me a hand.
It's your mess.

584
00:36:30.374 --> 00:36:33.166
Oh.

585
00:36:34.832 --> 00:36:36.332
Some big favor.

586
00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:39.041
I can operate that goddamn thing.

587
00:36:39.124 --> 00:36:41.291
You're absolutely certain

588
00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:44.416
that this will get rid of
everything and do the trick?

589
00:36:44.499 --> 00:36:47.582
-I mean, nothing left?
-Nothing but a little pile of ashes.

590
00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:49.416
We don't even want the ashes, Ernie.

591
00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:53.499
Well, then I'll turn it up higher,
and we'll burn up the ashes, too.

592
00:36:56.582 --> 00:36:58.166
Dust to dust.

593
00:37:55.707 --> 00:37:57.957
-Oh, my radio.
-Come on, you guys.

594
00:37:58.041 --> 00:38:00.791
Let's get back to the car.
Damn it.

595
00:38:00.874 --> 00:38:02.124
Come on.

596
00:38:17.457 --> 00:38:18.707
Freddy?

597
00:38:19.832 --> 00:38:21.166
Anybody?

598
00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:23.624
Get the fuckin' top! Fuck.

599
00:38:23.707 --> 00:38:25.874
Get the fuckin' top, man!

600
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:29.582
Come on!

601
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:33.457
Close the motherfuckin' windows.

602
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:35.999
I don't have any windows.
I busted them.

603
00:38:37.374 --> 00:38:40.207
-Hey, my skin burns.
-Me, too. Damn it.

604
00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:42.416
It's that rain,
it's like acid rain.

605
00:38:42.499 --> 00:38:43.957
Start the car!

606
00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:46.624
It's all over me. A towel,
somebody give me a towel.

607
00:38:46.707 --> 00:38:49.707
-We ain't got no towel!
-Well, then give me something.

608
00:38:49.791 --> 00:38:51.666
-Give me that.
-No!

609
00:38:51.749 --> 00:38:53.249
Give me something!

610
00:38:53.332 --> 00:38:54.624
Come on, start!

611
00:38:54.707 --> 00:38:57.582
-Suicide, get the car going.
-I'm trying.

612
00:38:57.666 --> 00:39:01.041
Oh, crap, I wonder what's
in that rain.

613
00:39:13.499 --> 00:39:15.374
Look at it.

614
00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:18.124
It's coming down like,
<i>einen getrunken soldat.</i>

615
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:49.457
-Is the heart gone, Ernie?
-It's all burned up.

616
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.957
-Are you sure?
-Right up the chimney.

617
00:39:52.041 --> 00:39:54.832
Goddamn, that's all we need.
We're home free, Frank.

618
00:39:54.916 --> 00:39:57.374
We got it made. You just
saved our ass, buddy boy,

619
00:39:57.457 --> 00:39:59.749
and I owe you one. Goddamn!

620
00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:02.207
Yes, you do.

621
00:40:02.291 --> 00:40:04.416
Alright, let's get back to that
warehouse, clean up the mess,

622
00:40:04.499 --> 00:40:05.791
and get the hell out of there.

623
00:40:05.874 --> 00:40:07.207
What do you say, Frank?

624
00:40:07.291 --> 00:40:09.041
Okay, just--just give
me a second to rest,

625
00:40:09.124 --> 00:40:10.916
catch my breath.
Then we'll do it, okay?

626
00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:13.791
Frank, I don't know about
you, but I'm really sick.

627
00:40:14.624 --> 00:40:16.499
Why? What's wrong, Fred?

628
00:40:16.582 --> 00:40:18.374
I feel like hell is what's wrong.

629
00:40:18.457 --> 00:40:21.124
-I'm really sick.
-I'm sick, too, Burt.

630
00:40:21.707 --> 00:40:23.624
Sick, like how?

631
00:40:23.707 --> 00:40:26.082
I feel like my head's
going to bust wide open.

632
00:40:27.582 --> 00:40:29.041
And I want to puke.

633
00:40:29.124 --> 00:40:30.707
And I'm weak, too.

634
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:32.582
Me, too. I got the chills.

635
00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:33.957
It's that stuff, Burt.

636
00:40:34.041 --> 00:40:35.582
It's that goddamn stuff we breathed.

637
00:40:35.666 --> 00:40:37.707
What stuff? What are
you talking about, Frank?

638
00:40:37.791 --> 00:40:41.082
When that canister cracked,
this gas squirted out.

639
00:40:41.166 --> 00:40:43.332
It hit us right in the face.

640
00:40:43.416 --> 00:40:44.957
We breathed it.

641
00:40:45.874 --> 00:40:48.082
It knocked us out.

642
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:50.082
We were out cold,
unconscious for a while.

643
00:40:50.166 --> 00:40:51.874
Oh, Christ! Ernie.

644
00:40:51.957 --> 00:40:54.207
Shouldn't we get to a doctor
or-- or something like that?

645
00:40:54.291 --> 00:40:55.791
Yeah, Burt, I need a doctor.

646
00:40:55.874 --> 00:40:56.874
Man, I'm getting the car

647
00:40:56.957 --> 00:40:58.957
and taking these guys to the
emergency ward right now.

648
00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.582
Let's go, Frank.
You're gonna be alright.

649
00:41:00.666 --> 00:41:02.166
We're gonna get you there.

650
00:41:02.249 --> 00:41:03.791
Hey, Frank!

651
00:41:03.874 --> 00:41:04.832
Frank!

652
00:41:10.582 --> 00:41:11.957
Come here, Ernie.

653
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:15.416
What's the matter? Talk to me.
Get him out of the rain.

654
00:41:16.582 --> 00:41:21.374
I gotta—I gotta call my wife.
I gotta go to the hospital!

655
00:41:21.457 --> 00:41:24.707
You can't run around in
this storm. You're too sick.

656
00:41:24.749 --> 00:41:25.916
Burt.

657
00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:29.916
Take it easy. Take it easy.

658
00:41:29.999 --> 00:41:31.207
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

659
00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:33.416
Paramedics. Paramedics.

660
00:41:35.957 --> 00:41:38.082
It's all right.
How do you feel now?

661
00:41:44.082 --> 00:41:45.374
Hello. Yes.

662
00:41:45.457 --> 00:41:48.707
Uh, can we get some paramedics
over here right away?

663
00:41:48.791 --> 00:41:51.916
That's the Resurrection Funeral Home

664
00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:55.499
at 21702 East Central.

665
00:41:56.624 --> 00:42:00.207
Uh, well, tell them to come around
the back, to the embalming room.

666
00:42:01.707 --> 00:42:04.249
Uh, no, no, um...

667
00:42:04.332 --> 00:42:08.499
Poison. We have two men
poisoned here.

668
00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:10.832
Uh, well, no, we--we don't
know what kind of poison.

669
00:42:12.249 --> 00:42:13.832
Right.

670
00:42:13.916 --> 00:42:15.916
Thank you very much. Bye.

671
00:42:17.957 --> 00:42:19.832
Burt, they're on their way.

672
00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:23.874
This car ain't going nowhere.

673
00:42:23.957 --> 00:42:25.124
-Damn it.
-Shh-shh!

674
00:42:26.082 --> 00:42:28.124
Do you hear something?

675
00:42:28.207 --> 00:42:29.916
Hear what?

676
00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:31.874
Something.

677
00:42:59.541 --> 00:43:00.999
No, I don't hear nothing.

678
00:43:01.082 --> 00:43:02.457
This roof's leaking.

679
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:04.624
-There's a rip, damn it.
-Shit.

680
00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:06.207
Oh, don't do that!

681
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:07.624
-Shit!
-I'm sorry.

682
00:43:07.707 --> 00:43:09.457
Shit, Scuz!

683
00:43:09.541 --> 00:43:10.999
Hello, there?

684
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:12.916
Freddy?

685
00:43:17.582 --> 00:43:19.124
Anybody?

686
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:36.791
Freddy? Are you here?

687
00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:57.416
Anybody here?

688
00:44:22.332 --> 00:44:23.999
Who's there?

689
00:44:26.916 --> 00:44:28.416
Brains!

690
00:44:30.791 --> 00:44:32.416
Brains!

691
00:44:35.582 --> 00:44:37.207
Hey, I got to get out of here.

692
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:38.916
Let's go to where
Tina and Freddy are.

693
00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:40.832
-Damn right.
-Fuckin' A.

694
00:44:46.041 --> 00:44:47.666
Live brain.

695
00:45:11.082 --> 00:45:12.666
Come on, quick!

696
00:45:34.582 --> 00:45:36.957
God, my skin's really burning.

697
00:45:46.666 --> 00:45:48.249
Hey, Tina!

698
00:45:48.332 --> 00:45:50.916
Yes! Oh, God! Help me!

699
00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:52.916
-That's Tina.
-What's she yelling about?

700
00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:54.791
-What's that sound?
-Through that door!

701
00:45:55.249 --> 00:45:56.499
Help!

702
00:45:56.666 --> 00:45:58.707
Watch the fuckin' step!

703
00:45:59.166 --> 00:46:00.749
Help me!

704
00:46:01.082 --> 00:46:02.541
What the fuck?

705
00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:09.416
Brains!

706
00:46:22.749 --> 00:46:24.916
More brains.

707
00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:33.374
Where the fuck you going?

708
00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:36.291
Help me bar the door!
Stupid fuckers!

709
00:46:52.916 --> 00:46:54.416
It's them.

710
00:46:58.124 --> 00:46:59.541
Who took the poison?

711
00:46:59.624 --> 00:47:00.916
Right over there.

712
00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:09.082
Stick your tongue out for me.

713
00:47:17.291 --> 00:47:18.832
What did you guys take?

714
00:47:18.916 --> 00:47:21.624
It was some kind of industrial chemical,

715
00:47:21.707 --> 00:47:23.499
I think, something in a tank.

716
00:47:24.082 --> 00:47:25.999
What tank? Where?

717
00:47:26.082 --> 00:47:27.916
Well, we--we're
not sure, really.

718
00:47:27.999 --> 00:47:29.374
Well, can you find out?

719
00:47:29.457 --> 00:47:31.374
I mean, your friends'
lives may depend on it.

720
00:47:31.457 --> 00:47:33.832
Yeah, well, I got to
make some phone calls,

721
00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:36.332
but I—I can't do that
before morning. I'm sorry.

722
00:47:36.416 --> 00:47:38.541
Let's take some vital signs.

723
00:47:46.041 --> 00:47:48.624
-Can I borrow your stethoscope?
-What's the matter?

724
00:47:48.707 --> 00:47:50.207
I can't hear anything
through mine.

725
00:47:50.291 --> 00:47:51.499
Well, are you sure
it's the equipment?

726
00:47:51.582 --> 00:47:53.041
What do you mean?

727
00:47:53.082 --> 00:47:55.666
Well, I'm not getting
anything on this, either.

728
00:47:55.749 --> 00:47:57.374
What do you mean? What's wrong?

729
00:47:57.457 --> 00:47:59.207
What's wrong?

730
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:01.957
It's all right. We just need
to double check a couple things.

731
00:48:12.124 --> 00:48:14.332
-No blood pressure.
-No pulse.

732
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:17.374
Well, what do you mean,
“No blood pressure, no pulse"?

733
00:48:17.457 --> 00:48:19.041
Shh. Take it easy. Take it easy.

734
00:48:26.791 --> 00:48:28.666
-What do you have?
-70.

735
00:48:28.749 --> 00:48:30.332
-70 what?
-70 degrees.

736
00:48:30.416 --> 00:48:33.166
-Well, what's that?
-Room temperature.

737
00:48:34.624 --> 00:48:36.749
Come over here for a second.
I want to talk to you.

738
00:48:42.874 --> 00:48:44.416
What are you guys saying?

739
00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:46.707
What are you guys saying?

740
00:48:48.374 --> 00:48:49.916
What was that thing down there?

741
00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:52.416
-What the fuck are we gonna do?
-Hey, Suicide's down there.

742
00:48:52.499 --> 00:48:55.041
No way man, he's gone.
That thing ate his head.

743
00:48:55.124 --> 00:48:56.416
Shh! Shh!

744
00:48:57.916 --> 00:48:59.416
I don't hear anything
down there, do you?

745
00:48:59.499 --> 00:49:00.874
Oh, we got to call somebody.

746
00:49:00.957 --> 00:49:03.041
-Who?
-The cops.

747
00:49:03.082 --> 00:49:05.874
I don't wanna call no cop.
The cops are just gonna kick our ass.

748
00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:07.832
Just let's get out of here, okay?

749
00:49:07.916 --> 00:49:09.791
No! We gotta call somebody.

750
00:49:09.874 --> 00:49:12.041
Wait a minute, where's Freddy?

751
00:49:12.124 --> 00:49:14.249
He was gone, he wasn't here
when I showed up.

752
00:49:37.457 --> 00:49:40.249
Holy shit. We're gonna have
to swim to get over there.

753
00:49:42.582 --> 00:49:44.166
What the fuck was that?

754
00:49:44.249 --> 00:49:46.416

No! No!

765
00:50:37.082 --> 00:50:39.707
You have no pulse, your blood
pressure's zero over zero,

766
00:50:39.749 --> 00:50:41.207
you have no pupillary response,

767
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.416
no reflexes, your
temperature is 70 degrees.

768
00:50:45.874 --> 00:50:47.291
W-What does that mean?

769
00:50:47.374 --> 00:50:50.832
It's a puzzle, because technically,
you're not alive.

770
00:50:50.916 --> 00:50:53.707
Except you're conscious, so
we don't know what it means.

771
00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:56.374
-Are you saying we're dead?
-Let's not jump to conclusions.

772
00:50:56.457 --> 00:50:59.541
Obviously, I didn't mean
you were really dead.

773
00:50:59.624 --> 00:51:01.874
Dead people don't move
around and talk.

774
00:51:03.082 --> 00:51:05.082
-What's the hell's that?
-Front door.

775
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.707
-What the fuck are they doing?
-I'll find out.

776
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.666
Listen we're gonna go
get a couple of stretchers.

777
00:51:09.749 --> 00:51:11.666
Just hang in there.
W-we won't be a second.

778
00:51:12.957 --> 00:51:14.207
Open the door.

779
00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:15.499
Open the door, please.

780
00:51:15.582 --> 00:51:16.499
Help!

781
00:51:16.582 --> 00:51:18.291
Hey! Open the door!

782
00:51:19.499 --> 00:51:20.791
Open the door!

783
00:51:20.874 --> 00:51:22.207
Hurry up!

784
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:23.541
Hurry up!

785
00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:26.207
Freeze, or you're dead!

786
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:27.582
Don't shoot, man!

787
00:51:27.666 --> 00:51:29.832
Are you crazy? Are you on PCP?

788
00:51:29.916 --> 00:51:31.957
None of us are on any
drugs, man. Just let us in!

789
00:51:32.041 --> 00:51:34.082
All right, come in, come in.
But no funny moves.

790
00:51:34.166 --> 00:51:35.416
Shit, no.

791
00:51:35.499 --> 00:51:37.166
You gotta lock all your
doors and your windows,

792
00:51:37.249 --> 00:51:38.624
and call the cops!
They're out there!

793
00:51:38.707 --> 00:51:40.457
-What? Who's out there?
-Don't you hear that?

794
00:51:40.541 --> 00:51:43.041
-What?
-Shut up and listen, man!

795
00:51:45.541 --> 00:51:46.666
What is it?

796
00:51:46.749 --> 00:51:49.374
-It's dead people screaming.
-What dead people?

797
00:51:49.457 --> 00:51:50.874
They came from out of the ground.

798
00:51:50.957 --> 00:51:51.916
And they're after us.

799
00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:53.666
Out of the ground?

800
00:51:53.749 --> 00:51:56.374
Our friends took off the other way.
And they're out there now!

801
00:51:58.957 --> 00:52:00.499
Brains!

802
00:52:00.582 --> 00:52:02.082
Brains!

803
00:52:03.082 --> 00:52:05.124
Brains!

804
00:52:05.999 --> 00:52:07.707
Brains!

805
00:52:08.499 --> 00:52:10.166
Brains!

806
00:52:12.249 --> 00:52:15.166
-Trash? Where's Trash?
-Didn't she go with them?

807
00:52:15.249 --> 00:52:17.207
I thought she was with us.

808
00:52:19.541 --> 00:52:21.541
-Hey, do you hear that?
-Hear what?

809
00:52:24.332 --> 00:52:25.916
Christ, Jesus.

810
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:27.957
What is that?

811
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:29.999
It sounds like people screaming.

812
00:52:30.624 --> 00:52:33.541
You get the stretchers,
I'll get on the radio and phone this in.

813
00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:55.416
Jerry?

814
00:53:03.082 --> 00:53:04.707
Brain!

815
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:06.999
Brain! Brain!

816
00:53:08.499 --> 00:53:10.082
What? What kind of a problem?

817
00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:11.666
Take a look at it.

818
00:53:11.749 --> 00:53:13.457
Why, what the hell's
going on out here?

819
00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.624
Mister, that graveyard out
there's full of people

820
00:53:15.707 --> 00:53:16.999
coming out of the ground.

821
00:53:17.082 --> 00:53:18.457
Whaddya mean "out of the ground"?

822
00:53:18.541 --> 00:53:20.082
Yes, out of the ground.

823
00:53:20.166 --> 00:53:22.374
They're horrible, they scream,
you've got to do something.

824
00:53:22.457 --> 00:53:23.374
Scream--?

825
00:53:23.457 --> 00:53:24.874
Yes, mister, they're out there.

826
00:53:24.957 --> 00:53:26.874
And there's one of them
in that warehouse.

827
00:53:26.957 --> 00:53:29.249
-Which-- which warehouse?
-The medical supply house.

828
00:53:29.332 --> 00:53:31.291
Oh, shit! Shit!

829
00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.624
-And they're--
-Goddamn!

830
00:53:32.707 --> 00:53:35.249
I-I-I think things are
getting out of hand.

831
00:53:35.332 --> 00:53:37.999
Mister, there's 100 of
those things out there.

832
00:53:38.082 --> 00:53:39.291
100?

833
00:53:39.374 --> 00:53:40.916
The cops. We got to call the cops.

834
00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:43.249
Yeah. No shit.

835
00:53:43.332 --> 00:53:46.499
Phone. Where the fuck is the phone?

836
00:53:46.582 --> 00:53:48.416
There! There's an office!

837
00:53:53.374 --> 00:53:55.874
Hello, operator, give me the police.
This is an emergency.

838
00:54:02.332 --> 00:54:05.207
Grab the hammer and nails! Casey!

839
00:54:05.999 --> 00:54:08.999
Quiet! Let's just get the
hell out of here, Ernie.

840
00:54:09.082 --> 00:54:10.999
-You got a car?
-I got a car.

841
00:54:11.082 --> 00:54:12.624
Get your keys.
Let's get out of here.

842
00:54:12.707 --> 00:54:14.207
My clutch is shot.

843
00:54:14.291 --> 00:54:16.207
We'll use the paramedic ambulance.

844
00:54:17.207 --> 00:54:18.249
Freddy! Oh!

845
00:54:18.332 --> 00:54:19.791
-Ernie?
-Yeah?

846
00:54:19.874 --> 00:54:21.374
Where are the paramedics?

847
00:54:21.457 --> 00:54:23.249
I'll get them.
Get my own car started.

848
00:54:23.332 --> 00:54:25.832
Oh, my god, Freddy!
What did they do to you?

849
00:55:08.707 --> 00:55:11.124
-Oh, God!
-What was that shooting?

850
00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.082
-Oh, God!
-What? What, Ernie?

851
00:55:13.166 --> 00:55:14.166
God!

852
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.916
-Oh, God!
-What the hell?

853
00:55:17.999 --> 00:55:19.457
It...

854
00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.041
It!

855
00:55:21.874 --> 00:55:23.999
"It"? It what? What is "it"?

856
00:55:24.082 --> 00:55:26.541
They're all over the cars.

857
00:55:26.624 --> 00:55:30.082
It's horrible.
They're out there. They're...

858
00:55:30.166 --> 00:55:34.332
Paramedics are dead. And we--we
can't take the cars. We-- I— Burt,

859
00:55:34.416 --> 00:55:37.416
we've gotta--we've
gotta call the police.

860
00:55:37.499 --> 00:55:39.374
Set him down. Set him down.

861
00:55:39.457 --> 00:55:40.957
Set him down. Easy.

862
00:55:42.124 --> 00:55:44.749
It's not--not--not
it's not working.

863
00:55:45.166 --> 00:55:46.416
Come on.

864
00:56:04.416 --> 00:56:06.416
-What's the matter?
-Dead.

865
00:56:07.832 --> 00:56:09.957
Brains! Brains!

866
00:56:18.416 --> 00:56:20.041
Help me.

867
00:56:27.666 --> 00:56:29.624

How many fuckin' windows
you got in this place?

889
00:57:55.374 --> 00:57:57.082
No more windows.

890
00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:59.791
The embalming room has steel shutters.

891
00:57:59.874 --> 00:58:03.291
Well, let's get the hell back to
the embalming room then. Come on.

892
00:58:07.874 --> 00:58:09.832
Man, my arms are dead.

893
00:58:09.916 --> 00:58:11.791
Put that goddamn
thing down, Ernie,

894
00:58:11.874 --> 00:58:13.707
before you hurt
somebody with it.

895
00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:16.332
-How they doing?
-Buddy, are you all right?

896
00:58:16.416 --> 00:58:18.874
-It hurts.
-What did you do to Freddy?

897
00:58:18.957 --> 00:58:21.416
What's wrong with him?
And this man?

898
00:58:21.499 --> 00:58:23.874
I think it's time you tell
us what the fuck's going on.

899
00:58:23.957 --> 00:58:25.499
I don't have to tell you anything,
dick brain.

900
00:58:25.582 --> 00:58:27.124
We think you should.

901
00:58:27.207 --> 00:58:28.791
Tell them, goddamn it!

902
00:58:30.624 --> 00:58:32.499
Tell us!

903
00:58:32.582 --> 00:58:34.332
There was a chemical.

904
00:58:35.541 --> 00:58:37.916
It was some chemical
that soaked into the soil

905
00:58:37.999 --> 00:58:40.541
of the graveyard and made
the corpses come back to life.

906
00:58:40.624 --> 00:58:41.957
Yeah? What fucking chemical?

907
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:44.582
I don't know what chemical, goddamn it!

908
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:47.374
It was ordered by the military,
I think. I think it was.

909
00:58:47.457 --> 00:58:50.166
Would you tell me me how the fuck
did it get all over the graveyard?

910
00:58:50.249 --> 00:58:52.582
I don't know. I just...

911
00:58:52.666 --> 00:58:54.041
All I know is that
it was stored

912
00:58:54.124 --> 00:58:55.999
over at the medical
supply warehouse

913
00:58:56.082 --> 00:58:58.082
where you were,
and these two geniuses

914
00:58:58.166 --> 00:59:00.082
managed to open the
goddamn container

915
00:59:00.166 --> 00:59:03.124
and let the son of a
bitch out. Let 'em out!

916
00:59:03.207 --> 00:59:04.791
Is that why Freddy's sick?

917
00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.957
I breathed it, Tina.

918
00:59:07.041 --> 00:59:09.082
So did--so did
Frank there.

919
00:59:11.541 --> 00:59:13.082
What did it do to you, Freddy?

920
00:59:13.166 --> 00:59:15.541
I'm freezing.

921
00:59:15.624 --> 00:59:17.457
My muscles are stiffening up.

922
00:59:17.541 --> 00:59:19.624
Stiffening up?

923
00:59:19.707 --> 00:59:21.624
Stiffening up how, Freddy?

924
00:59:21.707 --> 00:59:24.416
First, I got a really fucked headache.

925
00:59:24.499 --> 00:59:28.707
Then--then my--my stomach
started cramping--cramping up.

926
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:31.166
Now my arms and legs are cramping.

927
00:59:32.541 --> 00:59:34.249
Let's take a look. Let's take a look.

928
00:59:35.749 --> 00:59:37.207
Oh, God!

929
00:59:38.707 --> 00:59:41.416
Let's get his shirt up, huh?

930
00:59:41.499 --> 00:59:42.916
What are you doing, Ernie?

931
00:59:42.999 --> 00:59:44.957
Oh, God.

932
00:59:45.041 --> 00:59:47.791
Uh, the bruises where he's lying down,

933
00:59:47.874 --> 00:59:49.457
uh,

934
00:59:49.541 --> 00:59:51.624
that's blood pooling up.

935
00:59:53.749 --> 00:59:55.916
Easy. Easy. Easy!

936
00:59:57.457 --> 00:59:58.791
Okay.

937
01:00:02.957 --> 01:00:04.957
You know, it looks like

938
01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:06.957
rigor mortis is setting in.

939
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:10.332
Rigor mortis? What do
you mean, rigor mortis?

940
01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:14.291
Hey, God, you're dead.

941
01:00:14.374 --> 01:00:17.249
You're dead, and you're gonna turn
into one of those things out there!

942
01:00:17.332 --> 01:00:18.249
No!

943
01:00:18.332 --> 01:00:19.332
-No!
-No!

944
01:00:21.124 --> 01:00:23.124
-Let him go!
-Son of a bitch!

945
01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:26.124
Shut--
Just shush!

946
01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.291
Do you hear that?

947
01:00:33.249 --> 01:00:34.582
What is that?

948
01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:36.416
It's another paramedic ambulance.

949
01:00:47.624 --> 01:00:49.166
Watch out! Watch out!

950
01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:50.874
Hey! Don't go over there!

951
01:00:50.957 --> 01:00:52.166
Brains!

952
01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:53.624
Brains!

953
01:00:55.624 --> 01:00:57.582
God damn!

954
01:00:57.666 --> 01:00:59.791
<i>Fuck. They're gonna kill
everybody that comes here.</i>

955
01:01:19.957 --> 01:01:23.249
Watch out, I'm going to
put the board back up.

956
01:01:27.124 --> 01:01:28.499
It's got me!

957
01:01:45.499 --> 01:01:47.457
Get this thing out of here!

958
01:01:48.999 --> 01:01:50.999
Pull her off! Pull her off!

959
01:01:53.541 --> 01:01:54.957
Christ.

960
01:01:55.749 --> 01:01:58.499
Damn, he's dead. Shit. Shit.

961
01:01:58.582 --> 01:02:00.249
What do we do with this thing?

962
01:02:00.332 --> 01:02:01.541
What do we do with this?

963
01:02:01.624 --> 01:02:03.082
Just--just wait
there a second.

964
01:02:03.166 --> 01:02:04.499
Let's get out of here.

965
01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:06.249
Where the fuck is he going?

966
01:02:06.332 --> 01:02:07.874
Ernie, what are you doing?

967
01:02:09.124 --> 01:02:10.374
Hey!

968
01:02:12.249 --> 01:02:13.957
Let me take it! Let me take it!

969
01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:15.457
You can let go of it now.

970
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:16.999
Are you crazy?

971
01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:20.957
Look at it. She looks better now.

972
01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.916
Better.

973
01:02:22.999 --> 01:02:25.624
We got to get out of here, Ernie.

974
01:02:25.707 --> 01:02:28.499
Ernie, we got to get
the fuck out of here.

975
01:02:28.582 --> 01:02:30.249
Leave it.

976
01:02:30.332 --> 01:02:33.374
What are you doing?
Goddamn it, Ernie!

977
01:02:34.832 --> 01:02:37.041
I don't understand
what you want with it, Ernie.

978
01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:39.666
-What are we doing with it?
- I want to examine it.

979
01:02:39.749 --> 01:02:41.249
You make sure it's tied right.

980
01:02:41.332 --> 01:02:42.749
It's being tied right.

981
01:02:42.832 --> 01:02:44.791
I mean, it's not
gonna get loose, right?

982
01:02:44.874 --> 01:02:46.874
No, it's not gonna get loose.

983
01:02:46.957 --> 01:02:49.374
They're no stronger than humans.

984
01:02:55.499 --> 01:02:57.207
Don't be afraid.

985
01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:59.332
I'll bust it in the damn head.

986
01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:01.332
Now, you sure that
thing's tied good?

987
01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:06.082
-You can hear me?
-Yes.

988
01:03:09.832 --> 01:03:11.541
Why do you eat people?

989
01:03:11.624 --> 01:03:14.957
Not people, brains.

990
01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.624
Brains only?

991
01:03:16.707 --> 01:03:18.291
Yes.

992
01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:20.166
Why?

993
01:03:20.249 --> 01:03:22.374
The pain.

994
01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:24.707
What about the pain?

995
01:03:24.791 --> 01:03:28.082
The pain of being dead.

996
01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:34.999
It hurts to be dead.

997
01:03:36.457 --> 01:03:40.582
I can feel myself rot.

998
01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.041
Eating brains

999
01:03:44.999 --> 01:03:47.624
how does that make you feel?

1000
01:03:47.707 --> 01:03:52.124
It makes the pain go away.

1001
01:03:58.124 --> 01:04:00.374
Hey, look, man, fuck this.

1002
01:04:00.457 --> 01:04:02.457
I got to talk to you. Now.

1003
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.332
Come on, I got to talk.
We got to talk.

1004
01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:11.541
No, let's talk out in the hall.

1005
01:04:16.957 --> 01:04:20.624
Look, how can we kill those things?

1006
01:04:20.707 --> 01:04:22.207
You don't.

1007
01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.999
What the fuck
do you mean, "you don't"?

1008
01:04:24.082 --> 01:04:26.374
You can't kill those mothers,
they're already dead.

1009
01:04:26.457 --> 01:04:29.082
You've gotta understand they're not living
creatures, they're animated.

1010
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:32.416
You can chop them up into pieces,
the pieces will still come after you.

1011
01:04:32.499 --> 01:04:34.166
All you can do is
just burn them.

1012
01:04:34.249 --> 01:04:35.832
You got to totally reduce
them to ashes,

1013
01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:37.874
so there's nothing
left to come after you.

1014
01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:40.082
How you gonna burn
all those things?

1015
01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:42.207
Man, there's 100 of those fuckers.

1016
01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.666

1034
01:06:30.749 --> 01:06:32.374
if we, say, contained Frank and Freddy.

1035
01:06:32.457 --> 01:06:33.499
You know what I'm saying?

1036
01:06:33.582 --> 01:06:35.291
No, what do you mean, "contained"?

1037
01:06:35.374 --> 01:06:37.457
What I mean is lock them in a
room, so if they started

1038
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.291
acting funny,
they wouldn't hurt anybody.

1039
01:06:39.374 --> 01:06:40.832
They don't want to hurt anybody.

1040
01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:43.249
You bastard! Why don't
you lock yourselves up?

1041
01:06:43.332 --> 01:06:46.416
Look, lady, we're not proposing doing
anything to them, for Christ's sake.

1042
01:06:46.499 --> 01:06:48.499
We just want to lock them in
another room so we can figure out

1043
01:06:48.582 --> 01:06:50.291
how to get the hell out of here.
Alright?

1044
01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:52.666
Tina, that really is a good idea.

1045
01:06:52.749 --> 01:06:54.207
Where can we put them, Ernie?

1046
01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:56.541
Uh, yeah, well, uh, the chapel.

1047
01:06:56.624 --> 01:06:59.291
All right, help me with Frank, please.

1048
01:06:59.374 --> 01:07:01.332
-Lift his feet.
-Come on.

1049
01:07:16.541 --> 01:07:17.916
On the rug.

1050
01:07:20.124 --> 01:07:22.582
Lay them on the carpet, gently.

1051
01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:24.957
Easy.

1052
01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:28.374
Easy, Frank. It's all right.
Can you hear me, Frank?

1053
01:07:28.457 --> 01:07:30.624
Oh, boy, he's gone.

1054
01:07:32.832 --> 01:07:35.249
Oh, Freddy.

1055
01:07:35.332 --> 01:07:37.416
Look, let's just leave
them and get out.

1056
01:07:37.499 --> 01:07:39.374
I'm not leaving Freddy.

1057
01:07:39.457 --> 01:07:41.249
We got to lock the door,
you know that?

1058
01:07:42.332 --> 01:07:43.749
I'm staying.

1059
01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:47.624
Okay. Come on.

1060
01:07:47.707 --> 01:07:48.999
Come on, Ernie.

1061
01:07:58.249 --> 01:08:01.791
Dispatch, dispatch. This is bravo 751.

1062
01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:03.499
We're at the mortuary.

1063
01:08:03.582 --> 01:08:05.582
We see two, that is two,

1064
01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:08.624
paramedic vehicles parked
in the rear parking lot.

1065
01:08:08.707 --> 01:08:11.124
The doors on one
vehicle are hanging open.

1066
01:08:11.207 --> 01:08:13.499
Stand by while we investigate.
Over.

1067
01:08:37.874 --> 01:08:39.666
I got a man down.

1068
01:08:44.124 --> 01:08:45.666
Ah, Jesus!

1069
01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:50.832
Hold it right there!

1070
01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:53.124
Freeze or I'll blow
your fucking brains out!

1071
01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.957
This place...

1072
01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:03.874
Everybody that comes in
gets swallowed up.

1073
01:09:04.999 --> 01:09:07.207
Send more cops.

1074
01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:09.374
Well, what are we gonna do?
Stand here, beating our meat till

1075
01:09:09.457 --> 01:09:11.374
the corpses bust in this damn place?

1076
01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:13.499
There ain't no way to stop those things.
We gotta get the fuck out.

1077
01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.707
We got to get to the cars.

1078
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:16.124
There's corpses all over the cars.

1079
01:09:16.207 --> 01:09:18.957
-I know that.
-What are you proposing?

1080
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:22.082
What am I proposing? I think we
all should do some damn proposing.

1081
01:09:22.166 --> 01:09:23.499
The crawlspace in the ceiling.

1082
01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:25.666
We could go up,
barricade ourselves in.

1083
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:28.332
The only way up is the hatch,
and we could nail that shut.

1084
01:09:28.416 --> 01:09:29.832
You must be out of your fuckin' mind.

1085
01:09:29.916 --> 01:09:31.957
I'm not barricading
myself in no damn roof.

1086
01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.207
Shit, I'd rather take
my chances with the cars.

1087
01:09:34.291 --> 01:09:35.791
We need a way to fight them.

1088
01:09:35.874 --> 01:09:37.916
How about this?

1089
01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:39.291
What is that?

1090
01:09:39.374 --> 01:09:42.166
It's nitric acid.
Pretty much destroy anything.

1091
01:09:42.249 --> 01:09:44.749
Yeah, but there's not--
not enough of it, Ernie.

1092
01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:56.207
It hurts!

1093
01:09:57.999 --> 01:09:59.791
It hurts more than
you can imagine.

1094
01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:01.249
I know.

1095
01:10:05.207 --> 01:10:06.749
Freddy!

1096
01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:19.541
I can finally see

1097
01:10:20.291 --> 01:10:21.791
the one thing

1098
01:10:22.957 --> 01:10:25.874
the one thing that can relieve
this horrible suffering.

1099
01:10:25.957 --> 01:10:27.957
What, Freddy? What?

1100
01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:30.041
Live brains!

1101
01:11:04.832 --> 01:11:05.999
Let's go.

1102
01:11:06.082 --> 01:11:09.124
Brains!

1103
01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:16.624
Get the girl!

1104
01:11:19.332 --> 01:11:20.957
Run!

1105
01:11:23.124 --> 01:11:24.832
Put her on the couch.

1106
01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:28.124
They got Freddy.

1107
01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:32.124
It was horrible, ugly, man.

1108
01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:34.166
His face was all fucked up.

1109
01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:35.457
His face--

1110
01:11:37.541 --> 01:11:38.749
He's not Freddy.

1111
01:11:38.832 --> 01:11:41.166
Brains. Brains. Brains.

1112
01:11:42.832 --> 01:11:45.499
Make her shut up. Make her shut up!

1113
01:11:47.374 --> 01:11:48.957
Brains.

1114
01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:51.291
Brains. Brains. Brains.

1115
01:11:58.291 --> 01:11:59.666
Shit, he's trying to get out.

1116
01:12:00.624 --> 01:12:02.082
Get a bench, come on.

1117
01:12:05.874 --> 01:12:07.124
Ernie!

1118
01:12:07.207 --> 01:12:08.791
Ernie, out of the way!

1119
01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:14.957
Bring it against it. It's all right.

1120
01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:18.374
I can't.

1121
01:12:18.457 --> 01:12:20.291
Yes, you can. Get up!

1122
01:12:20.374 --> 01:12:22.916
We can't stay here, man. It's
gonna bust through that door.

1123
01:12:22.999 --> 01:12:24.874
We got to run for the cars.

1124
01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:27.707
There's zombies all
over the cars outside.

1125
01:12:27.791 --> 01:12:30.749
Got to fight our way through
them, there's no other way.

1126
01:12:30.832 --> 01:12:33.999
Once we're in the car and moving,
I think we'll be all right.

1127
01:12:34.082 --> 01:12:36.791
That's a big fucking "if," man.

1128
01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:40.374
I can't walk, much less run.

1129
01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:42.249
How bad is your foot, Ernie?

1130
01:12:43.041 --> 01:12:44.749
Broke.

1131
01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:57.999
Spider and I'll get one of the cars,
we'll bring it up near the door.

1132
01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.249
Police car. It should still
have the keys in the ignition.

1133
01:13:01.832 --> 01:13:03.791
Son of a bitch.
The motor is still running.

1134
01:13:03.874 --> 01:13:05.166
Good. I'll drive.

1135
01:13:05.249 --> 01:13:08.041
-No, I'll drive.
-Hey, fuck you.

1136
01:13:08.082 --> 01:13:10.999
When we drive up, I don't want to
hang out there longer than necessary.

1137
01:13:11.082 --> 01:13:13.832
Young lady, you stand right here.
Put one hand here, one hand here.

1138
01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.957
When I say "now,"
you open that door fast.

1139
01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:18.832
The minute we're through, you
slam that door hard and lock it.

1140
01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:20.041
Ernie,

1141
01:13:20.124 --> 01:13:22.749
get your ass over here at the door.

1142
01:13:28.999 --> 01:13:30.999
Burt...

1143
01:13:31.082 --> 01:13:34.999
That favor that you owe me.
Watch your ass out there.

1144
01:13:39.041 --> 01:13:40.374
All right, you stand by.

1145
01:13:44.957 --> 01:13:46.166
Now!

1146
01:13:52.832 --> 01:13:54.624
Run! Run!

1147
01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:57.499
Get 'em!

1148
01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:14.957
You got to get closer, man.
They'll never make it like this.

1149
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:16.416
We got to split. We got to split.

1150
01:14:16.499 --> 01:14:17.916
No, we can't split.

1151
01:14:25.041 --> 01:14:26.957
They left us, those jerks!

1152
01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:28.374
They left us!

1153
01:14:28.457 --> 01:14:29.832
They had to.

1154
01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:32.957
Burt will send help.

1155
01:14:33.666 --> 01:14:35.541
I know him.

1156
01:14:35.624 --> 01:14:37.041
They left us.

1157
01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:40.332
What are you doing?
We can't just leave 'em!

1158
01:14:40.416 --> 01:14:42.082
They'd have turned the
goddamn car over.

1159
01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:43.249
We'll send help.

1160
01:14:43.332 --> 01:14:45.207
Bullshit! Those are my fucking friends.

1161
01:14:45.291 --> 01:14:46.791
I said we'll send help, man.

1162
01:14:46.874 --> 01:14:48.916
-Coward!
-Fuck you!

1163
01:14:51.707 --> 01:14:53.082
Hang on, here we go!

1164
01:14:54.957 --> 01:14:56.624
What the fuck are we
gonna do now?

1165
01:14:56.707 --> 01:14:58.249
Find a phone, call the cops.

1166
01:14:58.332 --> 01:14:59.666
What the fuck?

1167
01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:00.957
Jesus H. Christ!

1168
01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:04.207
Shit!

1169
01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:10.624
Back to the warehouse!

1170
01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:15.791
Shit!

1171
01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:23.041
This way, you stupid honky!

1172
01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:24.707
That's Spider.

1173
01:15:26.832 --> 01:15:28.374
Shit!
Hey, Spider!

1174
01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:29.624
Hey, hey! Where is everybody?

1175
01:15:29.707 --> 01:15:30.624
I don't know.

1176
01:15:30.707 --> 01:15:32.832
-Who's he?
-He owns this place.

1177
01:15:33.707 --> 01:15:35.374
That fucking car is totaled, man.

1178
01:15:35.457 --> 01:15:37.916
That's all right. My car is
still out there. So is Frank's.

1179
01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.666
Not anymore.

1180
01:16:13.166 --> 01:16:14.749
Tina!

1181
01:16:16.166 --> 01:16:17.999
Tina!

1182
01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:20.999
Tina, where are you?

1183
01:16:38.707 --> 01:16:40.041
Forgive me.

1184
01:17:24.457 --> 01:17:26.082
-Brains!
-Cops! Get 'em!

1185
01:17:30.124 --> 01:17:32.249
<i>Ground, this is air 3,
we got a bad situation.</i>

1186
01:17:32.332 --> 01:17:33.582
<i>We've got officers down.</i>

1187
01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:36.624
<i>We have just witnessed ground
units attacked. Repeat, attacked.</i>

1188
01:17:36.916 --> 01:17:38.624
Helicopter!

1189
01:17:38.707 --> 01:17:41.957
<i>Attention. Attention. This is the police.</i>

1190
01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:44.624
<i>This area is under police blockade.</i>

1191
01:17:44.707 --> 01:17:46.499
<i>All persons within this area</i>

1192
01:17:46.582 --> 01:17:48.249
<i>wishing to surrender
should make their way</i>

1193
01:17:48.332 --> 01:17:50.457
<i>to the perimeter at once.</i>

1194
01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:52.874
Jesus.

1195
01:17:52.957 --> 01:17:55.541
It sounds like the shit's
really hitting the fan out there.

1196
01:17:55.624 --> 01:17:57.041
Man, we got to let
them know we're in here.

1197
01:17:57.124 --> 01:17:58.457
You better believe it.

1198
01:17:58.541 --> 01:17:59.957
Hey, mister!

1199
01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:02.707
Don't go in there.

1200
01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:05.249
There's a thing in there,
and it ripped out the phone.

1201
01:18:06.207 --> 01:18:07.791
There's another phone in the basement.

1202
01:18:07.874 --> 01:18:10.207
The basement's fucked!
You know what's in the basement?

1203
01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:12.457
-What do you mean?
-One of those corpses, man.

1204
01:18:12.541 --> 01:18:15.374
A real ugly one, all black and slimy.

1205
01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:18.624
I don't give a shit what's in the
basement, we got to get to that phone.

1206
01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:21.041
Blinding them seems to
work okay, doesn't it?

1207
01:18:22.957 --> 01:18:24.541
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1208
01:18:26.332 --> 01:18:28.041
Spider, open the door.

1209
01:18:28.874 --> 01:18:31.166
I'm going to knock
his goddamn block off.

1210
01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:34.582
Tina, it was wrong for
you to lock me up.

1211
01:18:34.666 --> 01:18:37.249
I had to hurt myself to get out.

1212
01:18:37.332 --> 01:18:39.957
But I forgive you, darling.

1213
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:42.291
And I know you're here,

1214
01:18:42.374 --> 01:18:45.082
because I can smell your brains.

1215
01:18:46.457 --> 01:18:47.749
Go away!

1216
01:18:47.832 --> 01:18:49.666
I'm coming up, Tina.

1217
01:18:55.874 --> 01:18:57.124
Freddy!

1218
01:19:00.749 --> 01:19:01.957
Freddy!

1219
01:19:02.749 --> 01:19:04.041
See?

1220
01:19:04.124 --> 01:19:06.999
And now you made me
hurt myself again.

1221
01:19:07.082 --> 01:19:10.582
You made me break my hand
completely off this time, Tina.

1222
01:19:12.207 --> 01:19:14.791
But I don't care, darling,

1223
01:19:14.874 --> 01:19:17.374
because I love you.

1224
01:19:17.457 --> 01:19:21.957
And you've got to let
me eat your brain.

1225
01:19:34.541 --> 01:19:36.457
Open the goddamn door.

1226
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.999
Brains!

1227
01:19:46.707 --> 01:19:48.499
Get him down.

1228
01:19:48.582 --> 01:19:52.499
All right, you guys, go.
Get in there, come on, fast. Get in!

1229
01:19:57.374 --> 01:19:59.249
Watch it, the step's out.

1230
01:20:06.541 --> 01:20:08.291
Jesus Christ.

1231
01:20:10.957 --> 01:20:13.749
That's our friend.
The Tarman got him.

1232
01:20:22.207 --> 01:20:24.499
Yeah. Give me the police.

1233
01:20:24.582 --> 01:20:26.957
It's an emergency, operator.

1234
01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:28.707
Captain, over here.

1235
01:20:28.791 --> 01:20:30.416
Two more cars around the side.

1236
01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:34.499
Yes, go ahead.

1237
01:20:34.582 --> 01:20:36.332
Yeah, you've got to help us.

1238
01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.874
There's a bunch of us trapped inside
your barricade, and we can't get out.

1239
01:20:38.957 --> 01:20:41.499
First of all, mister, what the
hell is going on in there?

1240
01:20:41.582 --> 01:20:44.707
I lost a dozen good men,
and nobody can tell me jack shit.

1241
01:20:44.749 --> 01:20:46.374
There are people in the cemetery

1242
01:20:46.457 --> 01:20:47.832
who are stark, staring mad.

1243
01:20:47.916 --> 01:20:49.457
They'll kill you and eat you.

1244
01:20:49.541 --> 01:20:52.124
It's like a disease, like
rabies, only faster. A lot faster.

1245
01:20:52.207 --> 01:20:53.957
That's why you got
to come in here now

1246
01:20:54.041 --> 01:20:56.124
and get us the
hell out of here. Please!

1247
01:20:56.207 --> 01:20:59.374
Just a minute, I can't hear you.
There's a lot of noise out here.

1248
01:20:59.457 --> 01:21:01.749
Hey, what the hell's going on?

1249
01:21:01.832 --> 01:21:04.207
Halt! I said halt!

1250
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:06.374
-Watch it.
-They're crazy!

1251
01:21:11.832 --> 01:21:12.874
Oh, shit!

1252
01:21:13.749 --> 01:21:15.791
-No!
-Fuckers!

1253
01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:25.457
-What?
-What is it?

1254
01:21:29.249 --> 01:21:31.166
Cops. They've got the cops.

1255
01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:33.207
That means they're breaking
out of the barricade.

1256
01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:34.999
Jesus Christ.

1257
01:21:42.082 --> 01:21:43.749
What's he doing?

1258
01:21:44.874 --> 01:21:46.666
What are you doing?

1259
01:21:46.749 --> 01:21:47.749
Shh.

1260
01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:54.707
<i>Hello?</i>

1261
01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:58.624
Yeah, I'm calling the number
stenciled on the side of the tank.

1262
01:21:58.707 --> 01:22:00.541
<i>Your name, please?</i>

1263
01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:01.666
Burt Wilson.

1264
01:22:01.749 --> 01:22:03.957
<i>Stay on the line, Mr. Wilson.
You're being transferred.</i>

1265
01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:07.249
This is Com-Q,
Denver, go ahead.

1266
01:22:07.332 --> 01:22:11.374
<i>Denver, this is Wichita. I've got a
C-L-Y priority on a 1-1-3. Who's up?</i>

1267
01:22:11.457 --> 01:22:14.332
<i>That would be Col. Glover,
San Diego. I'll put you through.</i>

1268
01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:19.166
Yes?

1269
01:22:20.249 --> 01:22:21.666
Yes, Captain.

1270
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:25.707
-I see. Very well.
-Horace.

1271
01:22:25.791 --> 01:22:28.374
-Put the call through to me.
-What is it?

1272
01:22:28.457 --> 01:22:30.707
Yes, yes, put him on.

1273
01:22:32.291 --> 01:22:35.124
Mr. Wilson, where are
you calling from?

1274
01:22:36.791 --> 01:22:39.541
I see. When did this take place?

1275
01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:42.832
And when was the tank first breached?

1276
01:22:44.082 --> 01:22:46.041
Why didn't you call
this number immediately?

1277
01:22:47.457 --> 01:22:50.666
I see. It's understandable.
Wh-what happened next?

1278
01:22:51.707 --> 01:22:53.124
Uh-huh.

1279
01:22:53.874 --> 01:22:56.707
Oh, you did? And what
effect did that have?

1280
01:22:58.082 --> 01:22:59.249
I see.

1281
01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:02.582
So, uh, what did you do then?

1282
01:23:04.874 --> 01:23:06.707
And what did they do?

1283
01:23:07.707 --> 01:23:08.916
I see.

1284
01:23:11.082 --> 01:23:14.499
Really? How many did you say?

1285
01:23:15.999 --> 01:23:19.249
And how many acres does
this cemetery cover, sir?

1286
01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:21.207
Yes.

1287
01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.499
I see.

1288
01:23:24.207 --> 01:23:25.249
I see.

1289
01:23:25.332 --> 01:23:27.332
Yes, I see. Of course.

1290
01:23:27.416 --> 01:23:29.624
Uh, thank you for your
assistance, Mr. Wilson.

1291
01:23:29.707 --> 01:23:32.499
I'm going to switch you back to
Captain Turner now. He'll talk to you.

1292
01:24:02.957 --> 01:24:05.499
Sir, this is Col. Glover.

1293
01:24:05.582 --> 01:24:09.582
I'm sorry to disturb you at this
hour, but we're at Q-2 status.

1294
01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:13.624
It looks like we've found that
lost consignment of easter eggs.

1295
01:24:15.916 --> 01:24:17.832
Yes, sir, pretty sure.

1296
01:24:17.916 --> 01:24:19.541
They've turned up in Louisville.

1297
01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:22.957
I'm getting confirmations on this
from the Louisville Police Department.

1298
01:24:24.124 --> 01:24:26.124
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

1299
01:24:27.874 --> 01:24:29.624
Well, sir, it would be good news,

1300
01:24:29.707 --> 01:24:32.249
except that the eggs have hatched.

1301
01:24:32.332 --> 01:24:33.874
What are they doing, man?

1302
01:24:33.957 --> 01:24:35.707
Hang on a second, would you?

1303
01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:37.707
I dunno. It's weird.
These people seem to say

1304
01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:39.666
th-they've been waiting
for this to happen.

1305
01:24:39.749 --> 01:24:41.374
Apparently, they've got some sort of

1306
01:24:41.457 --> 01:24:43.082
contingency plan to deal with it.

1307
01:24:43.166 --> 01:24:44.582
Well, that's great!

1308
01:24:44.666 --> 01:24:45.999
What is this plan?

1309
01:24:47.874 --> 01:24:52.666
Sgt. Jefferson, 42nd Special
Mobile Artillery. Yes, sir.

1310
01:24:52.749 --> 01:24:54.457
Good morning to you, too, sir.

1311
01:24:55.916 --> 01:24:57.791
Yes, sir. All right, sir.

1312
01:24:57.874 --> 01:25:00.374
Whatever you say, sir.
The code numbers please, sir.

1313
01:25:00.457 --> 01:25:03.082
Archimedes. Hotdog. Rhubarb.

1314
01:25:03.166 --> 01:25:06.166
Niner. Zero. Niner. Gotcha, sir.

1315
01:25:07.249 --> 01:25:09.707
<i>Bearing. Mark 2-2-0.</i>

1316
01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:12.207
Bearing,
2-2-0.

1317
01:25:14.332 --> 01:25:17.624
<i>Range. Mark 134 miles.</i>

1318
01:25:17.707 --> 01:25:20.332
Range,
1-3-4 miles.

1319
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:37.457
Hey, listen.

1320
01:25:38.999 --> 01:25:40.457
You hear anything?

1321
01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:44.166
Tina-a-a-a.

1322
01:26:02.832 --> 01:26:04.957
Spectacular result, sir.

1323
01:26:05.041 --> 01:26:06.874
Very close to optimal placement.

1324
01:26:08.291 --> 01:26:10.832
Well, sir, only 20
square blocks destroyed.

1325
01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:12.832
Less than 4,000 dead, General.

1326
01:26:12.916 --> 01:26:15.082
I wouldn't worry about
the fires, General.

1327
01:26:15.166 --> 01:26:17.291
The rain is taking
care of that right now.

1328
01:26:18.332 --> 01:26:20.374
Well, there have been
complaints about burning skin,

1329
01:26:20.457 --> 01:26:22.041
but I shouldn't worry.

1330
01:26:22.124 --> 01:26:24.041
Minor irritation, General.

1331
01:26:24.124 --> 01:26:26.082
The rain will wash everything away.

1332
01:26:26.166 --> 01:26:29.666
That's correct, sir. All should
be back to normal by morning.

1333
01:26:29.749 --> 01:26:31.249
Yes, sir, I understand the President

1334
01:26:31.332 --> 01:26:33.124
will visit Louisville tomorrow.

1335
01:26:33.207 --> 01:26:35.416
No, no, we wouldn't
want that to happen, sir.

1336
01:26:36.374 --> 01:26:38.832
No, sir, this hasn't been
very pleasant for anyone.

1337
01:26:40.374 --> 01:26:42.749
Thank you, sir. Goodnight, sir.
