{949}{1042}...little car takes first...|and third place!
{1210}{1309}{Y:i} A lot of Herbie fans|here today wearing Herbie's colors. 
{4534}{4624}- What the heck happened to you?|- I'm sorry, Crazy Dave.
{4626}{4711}I had a few problems getting|this critter on the truck.
{4714}{4799}Please. I've blown|bigger things out my nose.
{4802}{4836}Prettier too.
{4987}{5037}What was that?!
{5038}{5105}I wouldn't insult him|if I was you. He's sensitive.
{5108}{5169}- He's a car.|- Yeah, I know.
{5171}{5232}It's that he's proud.|That's all I'm saying.
{5234}{5313}The shed I got him out of|was just full of these old trophies.
{5314}{5367}I think he used to be a racecar.
{5369}{5423}A racecar?
{5425}{5542}Yeah. You know, I bet it took|first place at the Ugly-anapolis 500.
{5566}{5657}Oh! Oh! Oh, ow!|What did...?
{5698}{5769}It wasn't the car!|All right.
{5770}{5835}Just be calm.|I don't have to take this.
{5837}{5942}This is just a car...|an inanimate object.
{5994}{6028}Oh...
{6030}{6067}Are you kidding?
{6069}{6117}It just leaked all over my shoe!
{6118}{6178}Just get this thing|off my truck!
{6180}{6274}You are so in the crusher. Push!
{6629}{6657}Come on!
{6979}{7026}Come on!
{7165}{7218}Ahh! Whoa!
{7254}{7318}Whoa!
{7440}{7487}Oh!
{7545}{7607}Oh...
{7842}{7929}I'm... just gonna...
{7931}{8006}- I got to go!|- Hey! Hey, you...
{8376}{8443}All right. Listen up, car.
{8445}{8494}No one makes a fool|out of Crazy Dave.
{8496}{8528}No one.
{8567}{8619}Consider yourself crushed!
{8950}{9013}{Y:i}Marie Peters. 
{9066}{9098}{Y:i}Derek Parker. 
{9185}{9241}{Y:i}Gregory Petell. 
{9271}{9306}{Y:i}Chad Peterson. 
{9346}{9437}{Y:i}- Margaret Peyton. |- Yeah!
{9469}{9510}Congratulations.
{9587}{9641}I've seen some photo finishes|in my time.
{9643}{9679}That was cutting it close.
{9682}{9743}OK, Dad.
{9745}{9793}Getting dizzy.|Oxygen deprived.
{9794}{9831}Your mom would be so proud.
{9833}{9890}You're the first Peyton|to graduate college.
{9892}{9957}One where you don't|have to keep a toolbox at the end.
{9958}{10008}- Where's Ray?|- Running some laps.
{10010}{10085}We got a qualifying race.|He's working on some problems.
{10087}{10114}Like not crashing?
{10116}{10157}Mag-Wheels!
{10203}{10262}Check out what mom and dad|got me for graduation.
{10265}{10319}Oh, great. Rub it in.
{10369}{10412}4.2 V-8, right?
{10414}{10494}V-8, what? I don't know,|but it's adorable!
{10496}{10554}Promise you'll look|after Maggie in New York.
{10556}{10654}- We'll be roommates for 15 minutes.|- An assistant producer job at ESPN.
{10656}{10702}You'll be in front of|the camera in a heartbeat.
{10704}{10742}Have a great time in Paris.
{10744}{10827}Bye. Be back in a month.|I'll spring you from Riverside.
{10829}{10915}{Y:i}We'll cruise to the Big Apple|and start our new lives. Au revoir!
{10984}{11065}I promised your brother we'd|meet him at the track. We got to go.
{11067}{11121}Do I even get|a graduation lunch?
{11153}{11216}Well, this isn't quite|what I had in mind, but...
{11218}{11266}Hey, I sprung for the churros.
{11267}{11321}Dad, is Sally|still sponsoring you?
{11323}{11403}One of the proud, the few.
{11478}{11529}Hey, guys!
{11530}{11586}- Congrats on the ESPN job!|- Thank you.
{11588}{11665}I thought Maggie might swing|some free publicity over there.
{11667}{11729}Only publicity Team Peyton|needs is to win a race.
{11731}{11814}We're turning this thing around.|I know it. Believe me.
{11961}{12019}Aw, come on, Ray.|What are you doing?
{12058}{12102}Ray, what...?
{12359}{12397}Ow.
{12436}{12497}Ray, you were just|pushing the right front.
{12499}{12594}Was that what it is?|Did you learn that in college? Thanks!
{12673}{12758}- At least he loses with style.|- He's sure had enough practice.
{12795}{12859}I can't believe|Trip Murphy won Daytona.
{12861}{12929}He's a loser.|A well-paid loser.
{12930}{12977}Hey, Ray,|the guy's a great racer.
{12978}{13050}Say what you want about him.|He has excellent focus.
{13051}{13100}Focus.
{13230}{13282}You drove past that tree|on purpose.
{13284}{13361}- No. We're taking a shortcut.|- You were gonna chop it down.
{13363}{13425}We tried to knock it down|by crashing a car into it...
{13427}{13475}Oh, wait! That was you!
{13477}{13589}Oh, right. I'm not the one|who crashes into walls, am I?
{13591}{13645}Don't let him get to you.|The important thing
{13647}{13732}is when you see that tree and this town|in your rearview mirror,
{13734}{13819}you know you're on your way|to a better life. Right?
{13821}{13869}- Right.|- All right.
{14473}{14555}Now you, Gramps, had style.
{14599}{14635}He sure did.
{14654}{14692}Listen.
{14694}{14782}I'm sorry I didn't really pull out|all the stops for graduation.
{14784}{14838}It's OK. You know,
{14840}{14890}that was always|Mom's department.
{14892}{14986}It's been ten years.|I should have more of a clue.
{15017}{15075}I didn't know the team|was doing so badly.
{15078}{15178}Maggie, it's a bad streak.|We'll pull out of it.
{15181}{15308}But I do think it's time we find room|for you up on that wall.
{15474}{15522}That ought to do it justice.
{15594}{15650}- Night, Dad.|- Night, baby.
{15682}{15753}Tomorrow morning, getting you|a graduation present.
{15755}{15812}It's OK. I really|don't need anything.
{15814}{15885}I want to. First thing,|bright and early, you and me.
{15888}{15938}- You get to pick it out.|- OK.
{15941}{15989}- Good night.|- Good night.
{16340}{16413}Dad, uh,|what are we doing here?
{16414}{16453}Buying you a car.
{16454}{16532}I appreciate the gesture,|but I'm only here a month.
{16534}{16604}You don't want me chauffeuring you|around for a month.
{16634}{16698}Happy graduation, Magpie.
{16734}{16765}Hey, Dave!
{17141}{17190}Wow. A stock car.
{18115}{18201}One lap to go. Maggie Peyton|is about to make NASCAR history.
{18202}{18274}She's going! She's going!
{18277}{18324}She's done it! Unbelievable!
{18326}{18431}She's the first female driver|to take the Nextel Cup! Wow!
{18433}{18478}Hey, Maggie!|You find anything yet?
{18603}{18693}- Not yet, Dad! Still looking!|- OK, honey.
{19604}{19677}- What do you think, hon?|- Nothing calls out to me.
{19680}{19754}Now, trust me.
{19757}{19824}There's a certified|pre-owned champion out there
{19826}{19863}waiting to be discovered.
{19866}{19958}A car with the guts, the character,|the heart of a thoroughbred.
{20212}{20263}Dad! It's perfect!
{20265}{20329}OK, just think,|if this horn hadn't gone off,
{20331}{20398}I wouldn't have found|this Nissan!
{20488}{20539}Hey, Maggie.|What about this guy?
{20541}{20618}These are great. Take care|of the engine, they run forever.
{20620}{20693}- Doesn't really need anything.|- It's cute.
{20696}{20719}But, Dad...
{20776}{20843}How much for the Nissan?
{20845}{20906}Good eye. Good eye.
{20908}{20981}We've had a lot of interest|in that car this week. But, um...
{21021}{21063}I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
{21066}{21130}Since you are|the first customer today,
{21132}{21182}I think I can|cut you a deal.
{21276}{21327}Hmm.
{21329}{21370}I'll give you 50 for the Bug.
{21372}{21453}Sorry, no can do. See...
{21454}{21565}I always felt there was something|special about that car.
{21568}{21610}I wouldn't sell|in a million years.
{21612}{21681}- Seventy-five.|- Oh, sold!
{21682}{21732}I'll make out the papers.
{21963}{22013}At least we know|the horn works.
{22662}{22724}OK, Mags.|Tires are good.
{22726}{22770}Gas is good.|Brakes are good.
{22772}{22856}Look at that. The speedometer|goes up to 200 miles an hour.
{22858}{22925}Somebody's got|a sense of humor.
{22927}{23000}All right, now. Come over|to the garage later.
{23002}{23049}Have Augie|take a look at it.
{23051}{23093}Thank you, Dad.
{23590}{23628}"Please take care of Herbie.
{23630}{23708}Whatever your problem,|he'll help you find the answer. "
{23741}{23830}Great.|A fortune cookie on wheels.
{23873}{23908}OK, let's start slow.
{24145}{24199}What are you doing?! Stop!
{24285}{24327}This isn't funny anymore!
{24360}{24442}Come on, car!|You're a car! I drive!
{24480}{24530}What is going on?
{24598}{24647}Oh, my God! No!
{24857}{24908}- Oh, God...|- Oh, my God.
{24910}{24971}I'm so sorry.|Let me help you.
{25064}{25106}Are you OK?
{25209}{25286}- Maggie?|- Kevin?
{25310}{25362}God, you look great.
{25386}{25459}I mean, it's great to see you.
{25462}{25542}What are you... I haven't|seen you since high school.
{25544}{25609}- What are you doing here?|- Oh, I just got this car.
{25611}{25678}My dad wanted to get me|something for graduation.
{25761}{25866}Didn't you used to drive cars|with a little bit more, uh... muscle?
{25868}{25942}This car is not for racing.|It's for regular driving.
{25944}{25978}- For show.|- Yeah.
{26031}{26079}Oh, man.
{26082}{26178}You know what? It's not worth it.|I'm gonna take it back to Crazy Dave.
{26180}{26262}- Good to see you, Kevin.|- Yeah, good to see you.
{26292}{26357}Hey, Mags.|I could fix it for you.
{26360}{26418}Oh, no, that's OK.
{26420}{26494}No. That's what I do.|Kevin's Custom Car Shop.
{26497}{26557}- Nothing too fancy.|- No. Just the basics.
{26559}{26637}We'll take him for a test drive,|see what we got to work with.
{26639}{26715}- Sorry for almost running you over.|- Don't do that again.
{26768}{26874}Whoa! Whoa!
{26876}{26940}OK. All right. Easy, Mags.
{26997}{27066}- Smooth ride.|- Sorry.
{27069}{27135}Do you know where we|could get some new shocks?
{27138}{27199}Uh... There's a car show|at the Fairplex.
{27202}{27268}We could borrow parts|from the Hernandez brothers.
{27286}{27349}Yeah, I'm not really up|for that whole scene.
{27351}{27401}What? You used to|tear it up there.
{27403}{27442}Well, I mean, that was then.
{27445}{27524}Besides, this bucket of bolts|couldn't make it down there.
{27526}{27594}Whoa!
{27744}{27781}That's the Maggie I know!
{27783}{27840}What are you talking about?|I'm not doing this!
{27842}{27870}What'd you say?
{27968}{28009}OK, Mags!
{28149}{28202}Oh, my God.
{28259}{28313}It has more horsepower|than I expected.
{28315}{28374}Are you kidding me?|He just took off.
{28375}{28430}- He?|- Herbie!
{28432}{28478}OK, the car's name|is Herbie?
{28481}{28550}It wasn't my first choice.|Name came with the car.
{28552}{28607}Let's strip it down,|get rid of old parts.
{28609}{28678}- Maybe there's something to salvage.|- Works for me.
{28680}{28755}Go easy, Mags... Herbie.
{28803}{28834}What are you doing?
{28836}{28882}- Steering wheel's jammed.|- Left.
{28884}{28939}I can't turn it!|It's jammed!
{28941}{29006}OK!
{29008}{29054}OK! Easy!
{29055}{29126}Great. I'm being|carjacked by my own car!
{29478}{29561}OK. Watch the people.|Easy, easy.
{29562}{29602}Oh! That's the e-brake.
{29605}{29664}That should be|connected to something.
{29666}{29723}Oh, good.|They have valet parking.
{29725}{29772}Oh, man!
{29834}{29873}Sorry.
{29874}{29934}What are you doing?|You didn't want to come.
{29935}{29980}I didn't! It was Herbie!
{29982}{30021}That's funny, Mags.
{30062}{30101}"It was Herbie. "
{30134}{30188}- Hey. Where are you going?|- What?
{30190}{30271}- I'm so sorry.|- Her bad.
{30274}{30321}{Y:i} Step away|from the vehicle. 
{30322}{30348}Maggie!
{30350}{30401}- What's up?|- What's up? How are you?
{30458}{30516}Pablo, Pancho.|Hey, what's up, guys?
{30518}{30571}- Hey!|- Hello!
{30573}{30643}- You look good!|- Yeah, what happened?
{30646}{30700}Thanks, guys.|Great to see you too.
{30702}{30739}Hey, is that your car?
{30741}{30794}No. No.
{30796}{30858}No, no. I don't know|whose that is.
{30860}{30911}Good thing,|'cause that thing is ugly!
{31238}{31277}Hey, Trip!
{31359}{31407}{Y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,
{31409}{31508}{Y:i}Nextel Cup Series champion,|Trip Murphy!
{31584}{31642}I hope you don't mind|I crashed your party.
{31714}{31757}When I'm in the|middle of a race,
{31760}{31858}swapping paint with|Dale Earnhardt, Jr. And Jeff Gordon,
{31861}{31897}you know what keeps me going?
{31900}{31930}It's you guys.
{31933}{31992}My fans.
{32036}{32114}And now, I'm going to give you|that same experience
{32116}{32169}in your very own living rooms.
{32172}{32232}Crash? What have you got for me?
{32234}{32313}Oh, wow. You guys|are in for a real treat.
{32314}{32377}It's my new video game.
{32425}{32475}"Trip Murphy: Undefeated. "
{32646}{32687}All right.
{32690}{32749}{Y:i}You got a Sports Illustrated|shoot in an hour.
{32752}{32828}No sweat. I'll do two laps.|Keep the Sharpies handy.
{32830}{32900}And when women give you|their numbers, get photos.
{32902}{32951}I don't want|a replay of Phoenix.
{32954}{33011}- I do enough charity work already.|- OK.
{33013}{33053}Can I get your autograph?
{33088}{33135}Trip! Sign my head.
{33137}{33214}Yeah. Yeah!
{33216}{33245}Whoo-hoo!
{33246}{33313}Yes! Trip Murphy signed my head!
{33402}{33462}- Where are you going?|- Anywhere but here.
{33465}{33527}I'm not gonna be|embarrassed again.
{33530}{33566}What about the car?
{33567}{33634}Crazy Dave can keep his cash.|I'll stick with my board.
{33636}{33688}You can't just leave it here.
{33690}{33753}Hello? Look around.|Somebody will take it.
{34230}{34308}What is with this car?|Like it's trying to embarrass me...
{34650}{34681}Look at this.
{34683}{34750}Some guy named Maxx|left these in the trunk...
{34752}{34787}You look great.
{34789}{34898}You got a tiny little spot|on your shirt. What happened?
{34900}{34987}- You're gonna change into those?|- Stand guard. No peeking.
{34989}{35066}Don't flatter yourself.|"No peeking. "
{35472}{35508}Oh. Hey.
{35510}{35585}- Oh, good. It fits. All zipped up.|- Let's go.
{35586}{35650}- Wait. Where are the keys?|- Uh, they're in the...
{35653}{35693}Oh!
{35787}{35861}Oh, whoa. Take it easy, guy.|All you gotta do is ask.
{35918}{35981}I'd wear a helmet too|if my ride looked like that.
{36080}{36106}Oops.
{36123}{36214}- Come on. Let's get out of here.|- Good idea, loser.
{36216}{36310}Get this car back to the circus|before Bozo puts out an APB.
{36365}{36406}Ha-ha. Good stuff.
{36701}{36736}Oh, my God!
{36762}{36828}OK. OK, OK!
{36830}{36885}What are you...?|Take it easy.
{36928}{36985}Oh...
{37026}{37078}Oh!
{37146}{37213}Ohhh! Oh, dude!
{37273}{37360}- What did you do?|- I swear to God, I did not do that!
{37362}{37409}OK, try telling that to him.
{37458}{37529}Race! Race! Race! Race!
{37531}{37570}Trip! You gonna take that?
{37573}{37608}Race, race, race!
{37611}{37679}I can't race. Get out there|and tell them I'm sorry!
{37681}{37729}I love that I have|to do this. Sure.
{37731}{37803}'Cause Trip and I|have such a good rapport.
{37805}{37857}Race! Race! Race!
{37859}{37948}What have I got to lose?|It's a Bug.
{38039}{38092}Open.
{38094}{38181}Oh, my God! Kevin!|Kevin! Help me!
{38219}{38268}Kevin! Kevin!
{38294}{38351}Mags! What are you doing?
{38353}{38412}Kevin!
{38669}{38729}What is going on?|I don't want to race!
{38804}{38845}Kevin! Kevin!
{38947}{38993}Race, race, race, race!
{39240}{39303}What are you trying to do,|you crazy little car?
{40074}{40123}Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
{40923}{40992}OK. So that's|how you want to do it?
{43392}{43452}I thought you said|you hadn't been racing.
{43454}{43533}- That was unbelievable!|- I know. Unbelievable.
{43535}{43569}Hey, Trip.|What do you say?
{43624}{43667}Get that camera out of my face!
{43692}{43744}Did you see me|come off that guardrail?
{43746}{43798}I saw... I don't know|how you did that.
{43801}{43882}All right. This is gonna|sound strange, but it wasn't me.
{43885}{43922}I think it was Herbie.
{43925}{43984}Herbie is a car.
{43986}{44039}You always said|they had personalities.
{44041}{44110}Yeah, personalities.|They're not possessed.
{44112}{44217}I can't explain it, but when Trip|blocked me on that final turn,
{44218}{44294}I wished I was on my skateboard|so I could rail-slide past.
{44296}{44368}Then Herbie did it.|It was like we were connected.
{44370}{44448}That makes perfect sense.|Cuckoo!
{44450}{44488}What are you doing?
{44490}{44585}Checking to make sure exhaust fumes|haven't gone back inside the car.
{44587}{44682}Kevin, I beat the reigning|NASCAR champion in a '63 Bug!
{44684}{44739}- How else do you explain that?|- How about,
{44742}{44795}you're an amazing racer|and proved it?
{44797}{44847}Why are you|afraid to admit that?
{44850}{44985}You beat Trip Murphy, on your own,|with this... hunk of junk.
{44988}{45012}Ow!
{45099}{45151}Hey. Admit it.
{45153}{45208}It felt great to be|behind the wheel again.
{45235}{45280}Yeah. It did.
{45282}{45321}That's what I thought.
{45578}{45636}The family's been|in racing for 40 years.
{45638}{45694}I won't let guys in suits|tell me what to do.
{45696}{45776}- These guys pay our bills.|- What do they know about racing?
{45778}{45825}They know not to back|a losing team!
{45934}{46011}- Another sponsor bite the dust?|- They come, they go.
{46013}{46068}That's business.|You got in late last night.
{46070}{46137}Let me direct you to the date|of birth on my license.
{46138}{46201}Let me direct you to the|address on that license.
{46203}{46230}My house, my rules.
{46676}{46747}- Hey, guys!|- Hey, Sally.
{46749}{46816}Hey, Sal. Don't tell me|you're pulling out too.
{46818}{46890}No. I'm making your day.
{46892}{46932}You're gonna love this.
{46959}{47013}{Y:i}Taking the sports world|by storm. 
{47014}{47090}{Y:i}Here it is again. |Our exclusive footage of Trip Murphy
{47093}{47184}{Y:i}just getting scorched|in an impromptu street race. 
{47186}{47222}{Y:i}And get this:
{47225}{47324}{Y:i}The competition was|a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle. 
{47326}{47408}{Y:i}That's right, folks. |A '63 Bug. 
{47528}{47575}I'll be back. Dad!
{47577}{47625}What did I do?
{47902}{47959}I sense you're looking|for an explanation.
{47961}{48042}You promised,|no more street racing.
{48044}{48112}Listen to me.|I almost lost you once.
{48114}{48217}- I'm not gonna let that happen again.|- At least let me explain first.
{48219}{48263}OK, go ahead.|I'm all ears.
{48265}{48298}I ran into Kevin.
{48300}{48366}Kevin? You aren't|in town 24 hours,
{48368}{48452}and goofy Kevin talks you|into street racing again.
{48454}{48517}Maggie. Do you think|I busted my butt
{48519}{48560}to put you through school
{48562}{48625}so you could get back behind|the wheel of a racecar?
{48712}{48793}- Dad, I wasn't even driving.|- Who was?
{48794}{48892}It was Kevin's friend, Maxx,|who was driving.
{48894}{48950}They wanted to challenge Trip,
{48952}{49051}so I let them borrow the car,|and it was a one-shot deal.
{49154}{49184}Promise?
{49209}{49267}I mean, yeah. Yeah.
{49382}{49426}Sorry.
{49428}{49474}I'm sorry too.
{49696}{49770}Whoever this Maxx guy is,|must be pretty good
{49772}{49839}if he beat Trip Murphy|in a little thing like that.
{49841}{49878}Not bad.
{50567}{50649}Life's a Trip.|Then you drive.
{50650}{50698}- Cut.|- I nailed that one.
{50700}{50749}I agree. I'd love|to try one more.
{50751}{50832}- It doesn't get much better than that.|- OK. Moving on!
{50834}{50880}- Can I talk to you?|- What is it?
{50882}{50921}The sponsors are all over me,
{50922}{50972}and the ESPN special|is down the drain
{50974}{51034}because you banished|the film crew.
{51036}{51142}- I won't talk about yesterday.|- I'm not. I'm talking about tomorrow.
{51143}{51203}This is your future.|Those people paid for it,
{51206}{51289}- so get your head in the game...|- I can't deal with this, Larry!
{51409}{51481}Good hustle, everybody.|Good hustle.
{51884}{51961}It doesn't make any sense.|How could that thing beat me?
{51963}{52021}Nobody cares about|a stupid street race.
{52023}{52102}I care. I'm a Nextel Cup|Series champion
{52104}{52163}who got beat|by a Volkswagen Bug.
{52165}{52253}Yes. You're a champion|on the track, where it counts.
{52255}{52336}This is nothing! The reporters|get some laughs out of it.
{52338}{52409}By Thursday, everybody|will forget it happened.
{52410}{52489}I've been up all night|going over this race.
{52490}{52550}I outclassed him on every front.
{52714}{52769}- I want a rematch.|- Aw, jeez. Trip, no.
{52771}{52817}It's me, your brother.|Forget it.
{52819}{52893}A two-day racing event|where I beat all comers
{52895}{52959}and then destroy|that little Bug.
{52961}{53057}I want posters at every garage,|body shop and auto parts store,
{53059}{53118}and full-page ads|in the local rags.
{53120}{53177}How do you know|this Maxx guy would show up?
{53179}{53254}Maxx is a racer. He'll show.
{53384}{53458}I'm gonna exterminate this Bug.
{53780}{53813}Hey.
{53830}{53922}Where you been? Look at this.|I want to show you something. Huh?
{53945}{54001}2180 engine.|Dual Weber carburetors.
{54002}{54067}Front, rear swing axles.|Pretty sweet, huh?
{54069}{54125}Yeah, they're, um... Wow.
{54127}{54191}You really put|a lot of thought into this.
{54193}{54279}There's potential in this car.|We can turn him into a champion.
{54282}{54388}It'll take work, but, uh, there's|a race in Lancaster in a few weeks.
{54390}{54473}Whoa. Hold on a second.|The other day was great.
{54476}{54548}I don't know how it happened,|but it was a fluke.
{54550}{54604}You loved being|back behind the wheel.
{54606}{54663}Yeah, I did, but now|I'm moving to New York
{54665}{54716}and I'm starting a new life and...
{54718}{54762}How are you gonna|move to New York,
{54764}{54817}a city where you take|a subway to work?
{54818}{54869}Listen, I told my dad|no more racing,
{54871}{54910}and I ended up lying to him.
{54912}{54984}The last time that happened,|I ended up in the hospital.
{54986}{55077}Note the vicious Afterschool Special|cycle I'm trying to break here.
{55079}{55166}- I need cash for my apartment.|- Those are the classifieds.
{55169}{55216}Listen, Kev, I'm really sorry.
{55219}{55278}I know, I know.
{55410}{55447}What about Herbie?
{55449}{55531}I guess I'll drop off the keys|and the number to an exorcist.
{55660}{55702}What?
{55704}{55761}Maggie, what happened?|Are you all right?
{55971}{56027}I know what you're thinking.
{56029}{56076}It's one race, Mags.
{56078}{56143}One race, ten grand.|That's a lot of cash.
{56145}{56186}OK. We'll split it.
{56190}{56290}You got rent money to pay.|I got this dump to fix up.
{56292}{56350}Everybody wins.|What do you say?
{56371}{56401}Maxx?
{56966}{56994}Come on, Herbie.
{57214}{57254}Hey!
{57391}{57429}- Sorry.|- It's all right.
{58247}{58277}Yeah!
{59454}{59560}I have been over every inch|of this model ten times.
{59587}{59641}I've run all the tests.
{59643}{59737}There's no way an ordinary VW engine|like this could have smoked yours.
{59806}{59861}There's nothing ordinary|about this Bug.
{60006}{60071}I don't know what|it's got under its hood,
{60073}{60137}but I intend to find out.
{60454}{60501}Those guys|always use you
{60504}{60545}to get me to do something.
{60606}{60693}You can't let them drop us.|It'll break Ray's heart.
{60694}{60756}No. It's gonna|break your heart.
{60758}{60803}When are you gonna|open your eyes?
{60805}{60864}Ray Junior|is not cut out for racing.
{60866}{60943}I have held out|as long as I can.
{60945}{61030}Bass Pro is dropping you.|I'm sorry.
{61118}{61184}Wait a minute, Sally.|Wait, please.
{61262}{61322}Tell them to hold on|until the Speedway races.
{61325}{61425}If Ray doesn't place,|I'm out. I close up shop.
{61426}{61489}I'll sell motor oil.|I'll do something.
{61702}{61747}How long you been standing here?
{61772}{61808}Long enough.
{61879}{61928}I sure am glad|you're not part of this.
{61971}{62022}At least I did|something right.
{62883}{62953}Why do I feel like we just got|sentenced to five to ten?
{62955}{63003}I'm gonna go sign us in.
{63206}{63256}Maggie Peyton.
{63258}{63318}Haven't seen you in a long time.|Who you here for?
{63320}{63398}- "In-the-way Ray"?|- Actually, I'm sponsoring Maxx.
{63400}{63467}So, do you like the makeover?
{63769}{63833}You can take the car|out of the junkyard, Maggie,
{63834}{63905}but you can't take|the junkyard out of the car.
{63906}{63986}- How do you know this Maxx?|- Um, we go way back.
{63988}{64084}I'd like to meet him.|Can you arrange a face-to-face?
{64086}{64136}He's meditating.|Getting in the zone.
{64138}{64194}Sure. Pressure's getting to him?
{64196}{64280}- He's not worried. He beat you once.|- Beginner's luck.
{64282}{64366}You tell that to yourself at night|in your Trip Murphy pajamas?
{64368}{64401}Look,
{64402}{64509}you tell Maxx I'm really|looking forward to the rematch.
{64510}{64588}Oh, hey.|Sorry, big fella.
{64590}{64663}I'm so sick of all|this Trip Murphy cra...
{64665}{64698}Geez.
{64738}{64778}Hey. See you later, Trip.
{64780}{64849}I don't know|if I can do this.
{64890}{64931}Time to suit up, Maxx.
{64997}{65091}{Y:i} Race fans,|please welcome our own Trip Murphy. 
{65216}{65285}We've got 200 names up there.
{65287}{65360}By the end of the day,|there will be only one.
{65363}{65468}- Yeah!|- And that driver will face me,
{65470}{65533}and have a chance|to win $10,000.
{65564}{65596}Let's race.
{65614}{65662}{Y:i}Ladies and gentlemen,
{65664}{65742}{Y:i}today's winner goes up|against Trip Murphy tomorrow!
{66086}{66116}Herbie!
{66273}{66333}Vroom, vroom!|Let me hear you say "Hey, yo!"
{66335}{66394}What a day.|The real wild card here
{66396}{66460}is the enigmatic racer|known only as Maxx.
{66462}{66505}Questions abound.|Who is Maxx?
{66506}{66569}Where did he come from?|What's with the helmet?
{67275}{67320}Gotcha, Maxx.
{67635}{67699}I've signed so many autographs,|my hand is numb.
{67702}{67753}Guess who wants an interview.
{69602}{69665}How'd you get over here?
{69666}{69693}What's wrong?
{69726}{69825}Wow. Maggie, you...|look amazing.
{69827}{69907}I mean, you know, for someone|who changed in a Port-A-Potty.
{69909}{69984}Come on. I know there's|a compliment in there somewhere.
{69986}{70036}I think I'm losing my mind.
{70038}{70081}That was my first reaction.
{70084}{70172}And then I embraced|the mystery that is Herbie.
{70174}{70207}She's too young for you.
{70310}{70358}I got to tell you...
{70360}{70406}...winning definitely suits you.
{70442}{70502}Oh, I got you something.
{70562}{70590}It's stupid.
{70663}{70706}It's for luck tomorrow.
{70708}{70756}It's amazing.
{70953}{70987}Evening.
{70989}{71065}I hardly recognized you|without your camera crew.
{71067}{71132}I decided to give them|the night off.
{71181}{71216}Can we talk?
{71245}{71268}Alone?
{71322}{71371}- You OK?|- Yeah.
{71426}{71492}Your driver did pretty well,|for an amateur.
{71494}{71611}But he's got some serious flaws.|Take his car, for instance.
{71613}{71663}The chassis's too high, and...
{71666}{71730}...the aerodynamics|are all wrong.
{71733}{71813}Thanks for the tip.|I'll pass it on to Maxx.
{71814}{71874}You know what I|can't figure out?
{71877}{71933}Why you're not|behind the wheel.
{71934}{72008}I hear you were a heck of|a street racer back in the day.
{72010}{72070}- Ancient history.|- I doubt it.
{72072}{72103}It's in your blood.
{72105}{72172}Your grandfather was one|of the greatest drivers
{72174}{72209}to ever hit the track.
{72211}{72250}He's why I got into racing.
{72252}{72381}And I gotta believe it's|hard-wired into your DNA.
{72384}{72473}Your dad ought to get Ray out of 56|and put you behind the wheel.
{72475}{72557}How many women drivers|have won a NASCAR championship?
{72558}{72649}Well... It only takes|one person to blaze a trail.
{72690}{72757}Ever think that you might be|the next great Peyton?
{72809}{72883}Thanks for the props,|but I gotta go.
{72885}{72961}You want to see how it feels|behind the wheel of a real car?
{73099}{73133}Are you serious?
{73135}{73201}I doubt your old man is|gonna make you the same offer.
{73231}{73257}Go on.
{73260}{73308}It'll be our little secret.
{75294}{75334}OK, Bug.
{75336}{75396}Let's see what makes you tick.
{75643}{75708}There's no way you could|beat me with this engine.
{75832}{75868}Ooh!
{76138}{76185}You want a piece of me?!
{76518}{76550}Who's laughing now?
{76997}{77031}Huh?
{77422}{77505}- That was unbelievable!|- She's a pretty sweet ride.
{77506}{77555}I've never driven|anything like it.
{77557}{77623}That was my most awesome|driving experience.
{77625}{77692}Amazing what|a real car can do, isn't it?
{77694}{77774}I got a little proposition.|Why don't we raise the stakes.
{77776}{77813}My car for your car.
{77815}{77900}Let's make tomorrow's race|for pinks too. Huh?
{77901}{77975}I don't know. I mean,|Herbie's really special.
{77977}{78066}Come on. Nobody's gonna|take you seriously in that thing.
{78115}{78151}Now, if, uh,
{78154}{78223}you drive home|in Trip Murphy's stock car,
{78225}{78313}your dad would be an idiot|not to put you on the team.
{78314}{78380}What do you say? For pinks?
{78486}{78514}All right.
{78678}{78764}You just better hope your boy Maxx|is on top of his game tomorrow.
{78982}{79068}Ray, if you drank all the|orange juice, I'll kill you.
{79070}{79154}- Mag-Wheels!|- Charisma!
{79156}{79232}- Why aren't you in France?|- Ugh! Paris was a drag.
{79234}{79293}I couldn't understand anybody.|And hello!
{79295}{79353}Learn to pick up|after our poodles.
{79354}{79426}I thought I'd come back to start|our road trip early.
{79428}{79510}Slight problem. I promised|I'd meet a friend in the desert.
{79512}{79581}Why? Are you burying a body?
{79607}{79662}No, he's in a racing tournament.
{79665}{79752}You think you're clever,|but I see through you.
{79754}{79779}You can?
{79782}{79833}It's obvious.|You're dating him.
{79860}{79896}OK, if you say so.
{79898}{79969}Don't be coy. What's his name?|Is it serious?
{79970}{80081}Maxx. You know, we're so close,|it's like we're the same person.
{80082}{80145}What are you doing?|Where have you been?
{80146}{80236}In a nightmare where my dad,|brother and best friend showed up.
{80238}{80310}Well, you got a new problem.|Herbie's freaking out.
{80312}{80372}I don't know what to do.|Stop it!
{80445}{80496}Did you leave him alone|with Trip?
{80498}{80555}Hey, Maggie!
{80598}{80654}- Who's that?|- Keep her away from my dad.
{80656}{80701}And she thinks|I'm dating Maxx.
{80703}{80766}Just don't ask me to explain.
{80768}{80825}Five-minute warning.|Get suited up.
{80827}{80894}And have a heart-to-heart|with your car. OK?
{80896}{80926}Yeah. Sure.
{80952}{81008}- Where you been?|- Excuse me.
{81010}{81066}I'm Kevin!|You must be Charisma, yes?
{81068}{81121}- Good to meet you.|- I just came back.
{81123}{81218}- I had the worst time...|- Herbie. What's going on?
{81220}{81297}I don't have time for this now.|We need to beat Trip.
{81357}{81395}Just get a grip. You're a car.
{81398}{81452}You do what I tell you to do,|all right?
{81685}{81727}Boo!
{81729}{81781}{Y:i}It's winner take all at the
{81782}{81829}{Y:i}Trip Murphy|Sudden Death Showdown. 
{81831}{81894}{Y:i}Maxx decimated|his challengers yesterday,
{81896}{81968}{Y:i}but now he's up against|superstar Trip Murphy!
{81970}{82105}{Y:i}And now here comes Maxx|and Herbie to the starting line. 
{82437}{82482}Blow his wheels off, Maggie!
{82484}{82517}I mean, Maxxie!
{83266}{83319}Come on, Herbie!|He's pulling ahead!
{83414}{83445}That's it, Herbie.
{83833}{83878}Come on!|I want that stock car!
{84145}{84171}What?
{84173}{84200}Oh!
{84584}{84635}Stupid car!|You blew this on purpose!
{84637}{84679}You were supposed to help me!
{84681}{84768}The voice is more high-pitched|than I might have imagined.
{84793}{84837}Come on, Maxx.
{84839}{84916}Take off the helmet and show|everybody who you really are.
{85173}{85265}- It's a chick!|- That ain't a chick! That's Maggie!
{85309}{85363}I guess I was wrong about you.
{85365}{85423}You're not the next|great Peyton after all.
{85425}{85508}You're just another amateur|who choked in the clutch.
{85694}{85825}Mags! Maggie.|Hey. Hey, come on.
{85827}{85852}Come on. Stop this.
{85854}{85898}You had a bad day.|That's it. OK?
{85900}{86012}Come on. Let's get out of here,|take Herbie back to the garage.
{86015}{86100}- There's always another race.|- There's not. Kevin, it's over.
{86103}{86166}I should have never done|this in the first place.
{86169}{86195}That's...
{86392}{86484}- Hey. Whoa. Get away from him!|- Hold it, buddy! Take it easy.
{86486}{86551}- OK. All right! Easy!|- Wait a minute.
{86553}{86618}- Maggie didn't tell you?|- What?
{86620}{86674}We were racing for pinks.
{86676}{86765}It was a little deal we made|after I let her race my car.
{86806}{86891}She said it was|the best ride of her life.
{87050}{87097}Please tell me|you didn't do that.
{87125}{87226}Look, Kevin, I'm sorry.|OK? I'm sorry.
{87228}{87288}Don't apologize to me.|Apologize to Herbie.
{87289}{87336}He's the one|you stabbed in the back.
{87634}{87709}- How could you lie to me?|- I can explain.
{87712}{87753}Your word|used to mean something.
{87755}{87810}I thought I taught you honesty.
{87812}{87855}Guess I was wrong.
{87883}{87944}- Dad, wait!|- I'm through listening, Maggie.
{88118}{88208}- Don't hurt him!|- It's a car!
{88300}{88347}Payback time, Bug.
{88869}{88969}I can't believe you were pulling|a Racer X on everybody.
{88971}{89037}I thought this was|a conversation-free ride.
{89038}{89077}We've been friends for years.
{89079}{89135}I've never known|the real you until today.
{89137}{89164}A lying backstabber
{89166}{89225}who alienated|everyone she cares about.
{89228}{89293}You don't get it.|You were awesome out there.
{89296}{89325}Why go to New York?
{89328}{89386}You belong behind|the wheel of a racecar.
{89388}{89467}- Grab the wheel!|- What are you doing?
{89469}{89495}Sorry.
{89497}{89565}Look, I'm really excited|about this new career.
{89566}{89624}Are you going to be happy|to report the story
{89626}{89673}rather than being one yourself?
{89829}{89879}Trip, we need to talk.
{89925}{90011}Amateur hour's over.|I've got a real race to prepare for.
{90013}{90053}I want to buy Herbie back.
{90055}{90120}- Herbie?|- The Volkswagen.
{90122}{90184}Oh, yeah, the Bug.
{90186}{90271}I'm sorry. I'd like to help you,|but you're a little late.
{90273}{90341}Crash just took him out|for a little spin.
{90343}{90389}Trip, what did you do|with him?!
{90390}{90476}Ten cars enter! One car leaves!
{90477}{90555}Ten cars enter! One car leaves!
{90557}{90629}Ten cars enter!|One car leaves!
{90630}{90699}Ten cars enter! One car leaves!
{90701}{90770}Ten cars enter!|One car...
{90964}{91046}Yeah!
{91370}{91431}Ten cars enter!|One car leaves!
{91433}{91521}{Y:i}Drivers! Are you ready?
{91522}{91555}{Y:i}Get set!
{91557}{91611}{Y:i}Let's go!
{91925}{91972}Whoa, whoa, whoa.
{91973}{92016}- Drivers only.|- No, wait.
{92017}{92094}You don't understand.|That's my car out there.
{92096}{92173}Well, now, you parked it|in the wrong place.
{92284}{92323}My name's Jimmy D.
{92325}{92369}This here's my place,
{92371}{92428}and that there car|belongs to me.
{92430}{92467}How much to buy him back?
{92469}{92542}If he comes out|of this thing in one piece,
{92545}{92609}I'll just give him back|to you free. How's that?
{93309}{93420}Whoo! Monster trucks rock!
{93464}{93564}I'm gonna wipe that Bug|off my windshield!
{93773}{93805}Don't just sit there!
{93885}{93932}Do you work out?
{93933}{93998}Yeah, actually.|My gym's six miles from here.
{94000}{94028}Go, Maggie!
{94343}{94401}- What are you doing?|- Sorry!
{94521}{94588}Come on, Herbie.|I can't lose you. We're a team!
{94749}{94793}I need you, Herbie! Come on!
{94837}{94925}Oh, come on, Herbie.|Don't do this. Please!
{95137}{95188}That's it. Come on, Herbie.
{95189}{95226}You can do it!
{95605}{95651}I didn't do that.|It was the car.
{95653}{95759}- His name is Herbie.|- That's a ridiculous na...
{95872}{95922}OK, Herbie.|Let's get out of here.
{96797}{96862}Yeah!
{96884}{96925}Oh, come on!
{97172}{97212}Jerk!
{97416}{97486}Go, Herbie, go! Come on!
{97488}{97520}Yeah!
{97569}{97603}There we go!
{97750}{97809}All right! Hang on, Herbie!
{98100}{98158}Pile driver!
{98626}{98669}Thanks, buddy.
{99274}{99318}What...? What...?
{99320}{99385}Ahh!
{99488}{99512}Oh...
{99513}{99576}Look, I don't care if you|ever speak to me again,
{99578}{99621}but you have to help Herbie.
{99623}{99671}What happened?
{99673}{99746}I was a jerk. I know.
{99780}{99817}Me too.
{99820}{99906}- You weren't a jerk.|- No, I meant...
{99909}{99962}I also know you were a jerk.
{100075}{100165}What are you gonna do about ESPN|and New York and the big time?
{100167}{100228}I met someone|who made me shift gears.
{100229}{100280}You know,|get a new perspective.
{100429}{100474}We're down to the final few spots|to see who gets into the big race.
{100475}{100519}We're down to the final few spots|to see who gets into the big race.
{100521}{100581}One lap to go for|Ray Peyton, Jr. In the 56 car.
{100583}{100613}It's gonna be close.
{100615}{100712}Let's see if Ray Peyton, Jr. Can qualify|for Sunday's Nextel Cup race.
{100714}{100754}Come on, Ray!
{100932}{100989}Whoo! Yeah!
{101133}{101174}Oh, my God.
{101505}{101569}Peyton. To the right.
{101571}{101640}- He needs to be transferred.|- Ray, you OK?
{101641}{101689}I'm fine. I keep|telling everybody.
{101691}{101785}Can we please get out of here?|I'm fine! Jeez!
{101839}{101895}I guess that means|he's not totally fine.
{101897}{101932}No.
{101933}{101994}- Come here, Ray. Come on.|- Ow!
{101997}{102043}Doc, I'm fine.
{102045}{102122}- Look straight ahead.|- I see it. It's...
{102125}{102158}Now it's bright.
{102160}{102214}There's a problem|with his left eye.
{102216}{102272}His depth perception is off.
{102273}{102356}We won't know the extent|of the problem until we run tests.
{102357}{102414}Bottom line,|he can't race Sunday.
{102573}{102602}Dad, I'm sorry.
{102640}{102709}Hey. It's not your fault.
{102710}{102779}You ran great today.|I'm gonna go see the doctor.
{102781}{102808}Wait a minute, Dad.
{102811}{102842}I still qualified.
{102845}{102907}All we need is another driver|and we got a shot.
{103006}{103040}Let Maggie race.
{103111}{103181}Yeah, Ray.|It's a good idea.
{103182}{103254}I mean, Team Peyton|needs this race.
{103256}{103311}She's ready, sir.|She's really good.
{103415}{103479}No. That's not gonna happen.
{103481}{103513}Dad!
{103545}{103613}Dad, I'm sorry|I lied to you, OK?
{103616}{103686}But all I've ever|wanted to do is race.
{103688}{103737}You're not getting|behind the wheel.
{103740}{103820}Because I'm a girl? I've had|one crash. Ray's had dozens!
{103821}{103860}It's different!
{103861}{103911}The only difference|is your support!
{103913}{103970}What's really your problem|with me racing?
{104093}{104156}Because you're the|spitting image of your mom.
{104215}{104303}And... I can't lose her twice.
{104334}{104421}Dad, I may look like her|on the outside,
{104424}{104479}OK, but on the inside, I'm you.
{104481}{104517}I'm a Peyton.
{104519}{104581}Racing is in my blood.
{104584}{104625}Please, let me race.
{104680}{104728}I can't.
{104760}{104793}I'm sorry.
{104975}{105032}I got it. OK.
{105033}{105084}All right. Fine. Bye.
{105209}{105304}I have bad news. I just got off|the phone with my supplier.
{105306}{105398}They're not gonna give me parts|until I pay my overdue bills,
{105400}{105498}- which you need money to do.|- So you can't fix Herbie?
{105500}{105536}I...
{105850}{105923}- Shouldn't you be in bed?|- Mags, I'm not blind.
{105925}{106017}I just can't race.|But you can.
{106019}{106069}You're taking my space tomorrow.
{106072}{106117}Well, wait. What about Dad?
{106118}{106196}Dad always says|I should be a team leader.
{106197}{106283}I called rest of the crew.|They agree. You're the one.
{106405}{106444}Look, we got a lot to do
{106445}{106511}if we wanna get my car|ready to race.
{106513}{106590}There's one car I'm gonna drive.|He's sitting over there.
{106632}{106661}You serious?
{106663}{106735}I race in Herbie,|or I don't race at all.
{108162}{108233}I'm with Trip Murphy,|Nextel Cup Series champion.
{108235}{108301}The prevailing wisdom|in the press box
{108302}{108381}is that your only worry is you|don't have enough shelf space
{108382}{108424}for a fourth championship.
{108426}{108480}Tell the boys|thanks for the support.
{108482}{108552}But it's a tough track.|It's a 500-mile race.
{108554}{108613}There are some|competent drivers out here.
{108614}{108665}Jeff Gordon's a decent driver.
{108667}{108720}There's an outside shot|he could win.
{108721}{108771}I guess what|I'm saying is, it's a...
{108773}{108841}...long race and anything|can happen in this sport.
{109205}{109265}We love you, Trip!
{109298}{109364}I thought you told me|you destroyed that car.
{109365}{109457}- I'm sorry, dude.|- Hey, Trip.
{109459}{109498}I know you're gonna win,
{109500}{109569}but on the microscopic chance|she beats you again,
{109570}{109631}I've set up a Slim-Fast|"Big Loser" campaign.
{109633}{109664}So there's that.
{109745}{109791}- He's mad at me.|- He's mad at me.
{109793}{109857}- Hates me.|- He hates us both.
{109859}{109930}- Never seen a Bug with a spoiler.|- Don't touch.
{110089}{110144}Soft top on a racecar.
{110145}{110203}- I like that.|- I like that.
{110285}{110359}- This car just winked at me.|- A racecar winked at you.
{110361}{110417}I swear. The car winked at me.
{110418}{110478}Are you feeling OK?|Is it the pressure?
{110480}{110541}I'm fine! Fine.
{110544}{110616}No problem. I'm telling you,|it just winked at me.
{110710}{110740}- Hey, Kev.|- Hey.
{110741}{110801}- Could we get a second alone?|- You and...?
{110803}{110853}- Herbie.|- Of course. Hey, guys.
{110856}{110940}Ray? Augie? Let's give|the lady some space, huh?
{110943}{110990}- Sure.|- Thanks, guys.
{111271}{111354}You nervous?
{111417}{111481}It's good to be nervous.|Keeps you alert.
{111568}{111640}I just want to say,|in the spirit of honesty,
{111641}{111694}I did total a car once|when I was racing.
{111730}{111779}That was a long time ago.
{111820}{111913}Hey, um...|Thanks for not giving up on me.
{112009}{112058}All right.
{112060}{112100}Ready to do this thing?
{112184}{112246}Cool. Let's show them|what we got.
{113548}{113598}Here we go, Herbie.|This is it.
{113600}{113687}- Maggie Peyton. Is that right?|- That's what I've got too.
{113689}{113774}{Y:i}So it's Maggie Peyton|in #53 for Team Peyton
{113776}{113833}{Y:i}in a last-minute ruling|by race officials. 
{113835}{113897}What? Come on.|You've tried to think of a way
{113899}{113941}to sell gear|to women for years.
{113944}{113991}{Y:i}It says she calls|the car Herbie. 
{113993}{114052}{Y:i}I've never heard|of a VW Bug racing NASCAR,
{114054}{114106}{Y:i}but Team Peyton|found a loophole. 
{114109}{114158}- Go, Maggie!|- What are you doing?
{114161}{114219}You go, girl! Whoo!
{114275}{114324}Go, Maggie, go!
{114621}{114715}{Y:i} Ladies and gentlemen,|rise for our national anthem. 
{115482}{115518}Here we go.
{115673}{115748}- Go get 'em.|- Thanks.
{115794}{115844}Is this what you dreamed|it'd be like?
{115846}{115953}Yeah. I mean, I wanted my dad|here cheering me on, but...
{115955}{116029}Yeah. There's something|I want to say to you.
{116031}{116097}I guess|I underestimated you guys.
{116237}{116277}Good luck out there today.
{116279}{116328}Thanks, Trip.
{116330}{116420}Word to the wise:|It gets pretty nasty out there.
{116446}{116517}Uh, Trip, we got a race.
{116519}{116580}- Let's go! Let's go!|- Don't listen to him.
{116582}{116656}He's trying to get inside your head.|Kev, let's go.
{116657}{116683}All right.
{116724}{116772}So, you wanted|to tell me something.
{116774}{116826}Yeah...
{116829}{116910}I was gonna say,|don't cut your turns too tight.
{116912}{116947}Got it, chief.
{116972}{117016}OK.
{117162}{117207}Let's go!
{117647}{117780}{Y:i}Drivers, start your engines!
{118208}{118294}{Y:i} We've got|the makings of a great race today. 
{118296}{118365}{Y:i}Beautiful weather|and a great field of cars
{118367}{118437}{Y:i}as they head out|for their two pace laps. 
{118438}{118497}{Y:i} We anticipate|a record crowd. 
{118499}{118545}{Y:i}Fans have come to see|which driver
{118546}{118596}{Y:i}will hoist|the Nextel Cup trophy. 
{118597}{118650}{Y:i} Great stories|bookend this field. 
{118652}{118697}{Y:i}Trip Murphy, star of the season,
{118698}{118777}{Y:i}will lead the field to the|green flag from pole position. 
{118779}{118852}{Y:i}Then there's Maggie Peyton,|starting last. 
{118854}{118897}{Y:i}We'll see if she has what it takes
{118899}{118950}{Y:i}and if Herbie has|a good enough engine. 
{118953}{119026}{Y:i}The pace car is off,|the green flag is out,
{119029}{119098}{Y:i}and we're underway here|at California Speedway!
{119226}{119269}Those guys are fast!
{119271}{119347}{Y:i} Looks like|the 53 car got left in the dust. 
{119349}{119389}{Y:i}There is a minimum speed. 
{119391}{119442}{Y:i}She better get going|or get a black flag. 
{119444}{119511}Come on, Herbie.|We're not out of this yet.
{119556}{119610}Come on, Mags. Go!
{119613}{119689}{Y:i} Rookie jitters|or a mechanical problem,
{119691}{119751}{Y:i}but Maggie Peyton's|barely hanging on now. 
{119753}{119794}OK. Let's go get Dale!
{119901}{119963}{Y:i} Herbie|starts to gain ground. 
{119965}{120034}{Y:i}Here's Peyton drafting up|to Dale Jarrett in the 88.
{120080}{120152}{Y:i} Wait. I don't|think Herbie's drafting. 
{120154}{120211}{Y:i}I think he's|literally attached to #88.
{120213}{120261}That little car's|riding my bumper!
{120263}{120317}{Y:i} Come on, Dale,|shake her off!
{120337}{120407}Hang on!
{120443}{120475}Come on, Maggie.
{120532}{120598}Here we go! Ready?
{120622}{120658}{Y:i} What a move!
{120661}{120744}{Y:i}Maggie just did a slingshot on|Dale Jarrett to move past #88.
{120745}{120789}Yes! Go, Mags!
{120791}{120864}Unorthodox, but it|put her back in the race.
{120867}{120931}I bet her granddad's|smiling at that one.
{120957}{121031}We're back in it.|Who's running first?
{121033}{121084}{Y:i} Trip has Junior|by 2 lengths. 
{121294}{121335}Come on, Mags!
{122348}{122420}{Y:i} Best pit stop|of the day for Team Peyton. 
{122421}{122459}{Y:i}That keeps them in the hunt. 
{122461}{122515}{Y:i}Got a hungry pack|chasing the leaders. 
{122517}{122613}{Y:i}Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon,|Mike Bliss, all after the top spot. 
{122615}{122701}{Y:i} Maggie Peyton|and Herbie come up on the outside. 
{122703}{122785}Eighteen laps to go in one|of the most surprising races
{122787}{122821}in NASCAR history.
{122823}{122872}{Y:i}Trip Murphy in #82 is in front. 
{122875}{122934}{Y:i}But can he hold the lead|in the final laps?
{122937}{122960}Here we come.
{123171}{123217}Herbie, we gotta find|an opening!
{123261}{123303}We'll make a move on turn three.
{123360}{123394}They're boxing us in.
{123396}{123456}{Y:i} Three wide|behind the leaders!
{123458}{123502}{Y:i}Labonte low,|Peyton in the middle!
{123504}{123585}{Y:i}Peyton takes a shot from Gordon|and one from Labonte. 
{123586}{123636}{Y:i}And now one from Kasey Kahne!
{123639}{123690}{Y:i}Herbie's getting pounded|in this pack!
{123741}{123833}- I'm getting killed. Can't shake them!|- Yes, you can.
{123834}{123886}You can do this, sparkplug.
{123888}{123966}- Dad?|- Buckle down and grit your teeth.
{123969}{124004}{Y:i}Come on, Magpie. 
{124005}{124107}You're the next great Peyton.|Time for everyone to know it.
{124109}{124141}Thanks, Dad.
{124232}{124262}Look at that.
{124264}{124290}Now what?
{124365}{124443}- Any suggestions?|- Gas it. Gas it right now!
{124541}{124596}Huh?
{124597}{124665}{Y:i} There's|running over competition,
{124666}{124707}{Y:i}but never done like that!
{124709}{124748}- Yeah!|- Yah-hah!
{124750}{124809}- Oh-ho!|- Yeah!
{124846}{124901}Uh-oh. We've got a new problem.
{124902}{124978}Herbie's losing|oil pressure... fast!
{125046}{125129}Looks like the 53's|leaking oil on the track.
{125130}{125162}We're coming in.
{125225}{125313}Kevin, it's Sally.|What's going on with #53?
{125316}{125389}- Did you drive here?|- Yeah. Why?
{125392}{125449}{Y:i} Here comes|the caution flag. 
{125451}{125501}{Y:i}Everyone to the pits. 
{125503}{125593}{Y:i}Team Peyton may be out of|the race with that oil leak. 
{126068}{126128}That stunt you pulled|almost cost us the race!
{126130}{126181}Take care of the car|and let me drive.
{126224}{126290}- Can I make two suggestions?|- Not now, Larry!
{126395}{126456}Not a perfect fit,|but it'll have to hold!
{126489}{126545}- How bad is it?|- It might hold for 5 laps.
{126546}{126592}It might hold for one.
{126593}{126672}Either way, avoid being|slammed around out there!
{126748}{126834}Listen. You raced your heart|out there today, Herbie.
{126837}{126940}But if we keep going, that might|be it for you. Forever.
{126977}{127049}Sorry. I'd rather lose|this race than lose you.
{127149}{127230}Whoa! Oh!|Are you sure?
{127232}{127277}{Y:i} I can't believe it. 
{127278}{127352}{Y:i}Maggie Peyton and Herbie|are getting back on the track!
{127409}{127460}For a car,|you're not a good listener.
{127505}{127580}OK, Herbie. Let's finish this.
{127876}{127939}Where is she, Crash?|The Bug! Where's the Bug?
{127941}{127968}Focus on the win!
{127969}{128068}{Y:i} The fans are pulling|for rookie driver Maggie Peyton,
{128070}{128117}{Y:i}in a car she calls Herbie. 
{128249}{128308}Attagirl. Nice move.|Now go get 'em, Maggie!
{128310}{128371}{Y:i} Peyton|on an incredible rally,
{128373}{128413}{Y:i}passing them left and right. 
{128416}{128509}{Y:i}Now up to second place,|behind Trip Murphy. Amazing!
{128553}{128585}Come on.
{128741}{128786}Did you miss us?
{128788}{128856}This girl's really|beginning to tick me off.
{128857}{128915}{Y:i} 2 laps to go|in a two-car race. 
{128917}{129002}{Y:i}Trip Murphy and Maggie Peyton|will settle this between them!
{129004}{129055}Go, Maggie!
{129057}{129106}- All right!|- We've got him now!
{129304}{129328}On the outside!
{129353}{129389}Go high, Herbie.
{129529}{129580}Come on, Herbie.|We're almost there.
{129582}{129678}{Y:i} Door to door|off the corner at the final... Contact!
{129680}{129729}{Y:i}Murphy slams|into the side of Peyton!
{129881}{129955}Mags, don't push it.|Mags, Herbie can't take it.
{130193}{130273}- Forget the Bug and win!|- You're going down, Bug!
{130437}{130476}{Y:i}Trouble in turn four!
{130478}{130540}{Y:i}Murphy into the wall|and upside down!
{130568}{130662}OK, Herbie, you ready?
{130664}{130721}- Keep it steady!|- Ahh!
{130723}{130791}{Y:i} No place to go!|Look out for the crash!
{130793}{130840}{Y:i}Herbie's... 
{130842}{130912}{Y:i}Herbie's on the fence!|Herbie's on the fence!
{131037}{131084}Oh! Oh, God!
{131217}{131263}{Y:i}Maggie Peyton won!
{131265}{131355}{Y:i}- Maggie Peyton has won! Incredible!|-  Unbelievable!
{131357}{131417}{Y:i}I've never seen anything|like this in NASCAR,
{131419}{131504}{Y:i}not to mention the birth|of the next great Peyton!
{131714}{131798}We did it.
{131893}{131941}Let's go!
{131942}{131989}Whoo-hoo!
{132518}{132586}- Whoo!|- Yes!
{132665}{132724}I'm so proud of you!

{132777}{132816}Maggie, that was awesome!
{132817}{132885}- Thank you.|- So great!
{133000}{133055}Hey! I thought|your depth perception...
{133057}{133103}Oh, well,
{133105}{133179}the best Peyton was on|the track today. You did it.
{133181}{133249}- Congrats.|- Oh...
{133252}{133290}Look!|Listen to me!
{133293}{133331}That car is possessed!
{133333}{133367}Trip!
{133399}{133453}I saw it too.|It smiled at me!
{133480}{133523}That car is alive!
{133525}{133605}You gotta believe me.|It's mocking me!
{133607}{133666}I'm telling you!|That car is alive!

{133811}{133885}You gotta believe me!|You gotta believe me!

{134017}{134104}He's fine. He's fine.|Just a little dehydrated.
{134134}{134173}Wow.
{134257}{134332}Gotta say, Peyton, you and|Herbie make a great team.
{134334}{134390}We make a great team.
{134392}{134476}Yeah, I thought we had good|driver-crew chief rapport there.
{134477}{134536}Herbie, help me out here.
{134537}{134569}Wha...
{135214}{135280}All right, now, I'm gonna trust|you guys this time,
