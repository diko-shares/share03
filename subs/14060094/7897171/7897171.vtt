1
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.474
Listen up, people!

2
00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.845
If fingers need to be pointed,

3
00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.882
we know where to point them.

4
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.850
They use the recovering economy

5
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:55.321
and the rising stock market
as their bulletproof vest.

6
00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.991
But whose money is it?

7
00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.893
- Is it mine?
- No!

8
00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.928
- Is it yours?
- No!

9
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.530
- I can't hear you.
- No!

10
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:08.535
And despite all this wealth
they are hoarding,

11
00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.571
they have the gall to accuse us

12
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:15.542
of trying to destroy society
with our policies

13
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.545
that promote equal pay
for women.

14
00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:22.582
Racial equality for all people.

15
00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.718
And health care for everyone.

16
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.089
- Well, what do we say?
- Game over!

17
00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:31.558
- Say that again!
- Game over!

18
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.895
- Say like you mean it!
- Game over!

19
00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.766
They label us
"domestic terrorists"

20
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.570
when they're the ones
stifling our First Amendment

21
00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:47.942
with ruthless threats
and divisive political warfare.

22
00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:56.951
Financial greed and unbridled
power is all they know.

23
00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:01.487
Well, now, we have
something to say!

24
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.792
- Say it! Say it!
- Say it!

25
00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:09.129
If the leaders of
the United States Government

26
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:11.899
won't respect its people...

27
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.004
its people
will not respect them!

28
00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:21.407
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

29
00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:27.882
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

30
00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.617
Um, could you...

31
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.788
Never mind.

32
00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.463
Ma'am. Sorry about that.

33
00:03:18.332 --> 00:03:20.868
- Hope it won't hurt my rating.
- No...

34
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:09.910
Come on, you cowards!

35
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.178
- Come on!
- Shut up!

36
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:14.580
- Everybody, move back!
- Get on out of here!

37
00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.649
We want that shitbird spy!

38
00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.651
Sir, we can't do that.
Now, please, back up!

39
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.654
Hand the hussy over!

40
00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.133
Or we'll feed her and y'all
to T and Rex

41
00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:25.325
one piece at a time.

42
00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.019
- You Robinson's special guy?
- I am.

43
00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.721
- Thank goodness you're here.
- You called the local sheriff?

44
00:05:54.755 --> 00:05:56.356
Of course not.

45
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.858
Someone must have called it in

46
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.095
when I unloaded my revolver
at the crazies.

47
00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:02.830
I panicked.

48
00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.673
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

49
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.121
Based on the fact these crazies
are about to bury you

50
00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:29.890
in a shallow grave,
something happened.

51
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.861
I've been out here
almost two years

52
00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:36.730
playing the part
with these racist bastards,

53
00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:38.866
and it's getting inside my head.

54
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.202
I got sloppy.

55
00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:43.737
They found a few bugs.

56
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.772
Somehow traced it back to me.

57
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:48.442
Stop it, Special Agent Davidson.

58
00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.311
I need you to keep your
wits intact.

59
00:06:51.345 --> 00:06:53.080
I thought it was your job

60
00:06:53.113 --> 00:06:55.048
to get me out of
this kind of situation.

61
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:58.418
That is correct.
And I'm about to.

62
00:06:58.452 --> 00:07:01.421
Come on, bitch!
Come on out!

63
00:07:01.455 --> 00:07:03.066
You ain't pretty enough
to be this stupid.

64
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.092
You're about to eat
some buckshot.

65
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.062
Back up before someone
gets hurt!

66
00:08:03.517 --> 00:08:05.819
Which one of you wants
an extra hole in your head?

67
00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:08.855
Hey, let's light 'em up,
like a firework!

68
00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:35.249
- Bitch.
- Move!

69
00:08:35.282 --> 00:08:36.883
- Move!
- Let's go!

70
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.862
- Stay back!
- Grab the hoses!

71
00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:57.871
Get in the car.

72
00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.339
Stay low.

73
00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.909
Come on! Come on!

74
00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:09.283
Subtle.

75
00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:17.991
Listen, can we
just cut to it?

76
00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:21.361
Are you officially
asking for my help?

77
00:09:21.395 --> 00:09:23.096
Because if you are,

78
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.232
I think I have a few solutions.

79
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.437
Alright then, I'll handle it.

80
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.272
We'll talk soon.

81
00:09:34.308 --> 00:09:36.376
The President's Chief of Staff
isn't happy

82
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.213
with how local PD are handling
the millennial soapbox crowd.

83
00:09:40.247 --> 00:09:42.849
Didn't realize
the FBI was charged

84
00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.152
with crowd control
at the White House.

85
00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:47.054
At least they know who to call

86
00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:49.389
when they want
something done right.

87
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:52.893
You ask me, all these politicos
are chasing their own shadows.

88
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.395
If they wanna last longer
than one term,

89
00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:57.431
they need to smarten up

90
00:09:57.464 --> 00:10:01.601
and understand what got them
elected in the first place.

91
00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:03.270
Fear.

92
00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:05.238
When the people are afraid
for their jobs

93
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:07.207
or their wallets,
or their lives,

94
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.976
they want Uncle Sam
to protect them.

95
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.212
So if these
politically-correct puppets

96
00:10:12.245 --> 00:10:15.582
wanna straighten out
ornery protesters,

97
00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.117
give 'em fear.

98
00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:20.987
Good thing they have you, Gabe.

99
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.959
If I've learned anything,
this job's all about

100
00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.995
finding creative ways
of keeping the peace.

101
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.499
So...

102
00:10:32.532 --> 00:10:34.101
Davidson.

103
00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:35.635
She's pretty shaken up.

104
00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.270
I dropped her off at a facility.

105
00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.639
She's... being cleaned up
and debriefed.

106
00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:42.976
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

107
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.978
These deep covers
are like the birds

108
00:10:45.011 --> 00:10:47.381
that keep flying
into these windows.

109
00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.416
They wiggle and flop around
a whole lot,

110
00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:52.486
but eventually they come back
to their senses.

111
00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.488
Yeah, most of the time.

112
00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:56.256
What a waste.

113
00:10:57.591 --> 00:10:59.092
Lucky we got her out at all.

114
00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:01.094
Oh, I wouldn't call it luck.

115
00:11:01.128 --> 00:11:04.664
I would call it having an ace
in the hole. You.

116
00:11:04.698 --> 00:11:06.099
As always...

117
00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:08.502
I appreciate you making it
happen, Travis.

118
00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:29.082
- Hey, princess.
- Grandpa!

119
00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.585
- Where'd you go?
- I was checking the perimeter.

120
00:12:31.618 --> 00:12:33.620
- All clear?
- All clear.

121
00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.355
Let's get some cake.

122
00:12:42.362 --> 00:12:45.365
- Stay at your place?
- I'd like to try a normal life.

123
00:12:45.398 --> 00:12:47.100
Be in town more.

124
00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.803
Be more involved in her world.

125
00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:51.071
Retire?

126
00:12:51.104 --> 00:12:53.406
Is Gabe on board with this plan?

127
00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:58.354
Yeah, you haven't even mustered
up the courage to tell him.

128
00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:01.515
It's not that simple.
I'm going to. Soon.

129
00:13:01.548 --> 00:13:03.416
Open it. Open it!

130
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.119
- Is that a purse?
- Wow!

131
00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:09.122
Maybe one or two weekends
a month.

132
00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:11.792
The odd weekday,
if we can make that work.

133
00:13:11.826 --> 00:13:13.460
You're busy enough
at the hospital.

134
00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:16.129
This way, I could help
take a bit of the load off.

135
00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:17.531
And it would be good for her.

136
00:13:17.564 --> 00:13:20.634
- And you know this how?
- She suggested it.

137
00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.569
She likes me.

138
00:13:22.602 --> 00:13:24.371
And she wants a male figure
in her life

139
00:13:24.404 --> 00:13:26.439
on a, you know,
consistent basis.

140
00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.509
Dad, is that a dig
at my love life?

141
00:13:29.543 --> 00:13:31.812
Not at all.

142
00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:34.314
Not your fault
that deadbeat ran off.

143
00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:39.252
Maybe she does,
but... I'm just not convinced

144
00:13:39.286 --> 00:13:42.222
that she needs one who's
borderline certifiable.

145
00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:45.325
It's not that bad.

146
00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:48.328
- How many exits?
- Exits?

147
00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:50.230
In this building.
How many exits?

148
00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.832
What is it? What is it?

149
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.242
She makes rounds...
checking to see

150
00:14:02.275 --> 00:14:03.754
that all the doors in the house
are locked.

151
00:14:03.778 --> 00:14:05.178
Good.

152
00:14:05.211 --> 00:14:07.581
Every hour, on the hour.

153
00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:09.182
Could be hereditary.

154
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:11.284
Maybe, or she could be
learning it from you.

155
00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:12.787
You know, first it's the locks.

156
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.522
Next it will be the windows,
the gas stove, the electricity,

157
00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:17.567
and before you know it, she's
going to be asking for a Beretta

158
00:14:17.591 --> 00:14:19.192
for her tenth birthday.

159
00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:21.829
That's too young
by a couple of years.

160
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:23.697
Look, I'm handling it.

161
00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:26.132
It's under control.

162
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.668
And besides,
a little paranoia's healthy.

163
00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:31.471
You never know
what nutcases are out there.

164
00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:33.874
I'm just giving her the tools
to protect herself.

165
00:14:33.908 --> 00:14:35.575
That's where you're wrong.

166
00:14:35.609 --> 00:14:37.510
You think that it's all about
protecting her?

167
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:39.245
In reality, you might be the one

168
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.247
who turns her
into a crazy person.

169
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.118
Three. Or five.

170
00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:49.824
Front entrance.
Fire exit on the right.

171
00:14:49.857 --> 00:14:51.792
Loading dock in the back.

172
00:14:51.826 --> 00:14:55.195
Two more, if you count
the windows in the bathrooms.

173
00:14:57.263 --> 00:14:59.900
Look, I wasn't a
great husband or father

174
00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:02.168
and I can't unwind that.

175
00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:03.637
But if you give me the chance,

176
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.272
I'd like to be the best
grandfather I can be.

177
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.276
This for Natalie, or you?

178
00:15:13.948 --> 00:15:16.884
Thank you, gramps. I love it!

179
00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:18.953
You're welcome, sweetie.

180
00:15:30.965 --> 00:15:33.533
Washington News Cycle.

181
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.819
Pass.

182
00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:54.487
- Pass!
- Drew.

183
00:15:54.521 --> 00:15:57.858
Yeah, Sofia Flores' death
is a tragedy.

184
00:15:57.892 --> 00:15:59.492
No one's arguing that.

185
00:15:59.526 --> 00:16:01.561
But to call out Metro PD
as criminal

186
00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:03.831
for not naming a suspect
or divulging evidence,

187
00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:05.432
that's not news.

188
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.001
That's them doing their job.

189
00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:08.712
I've been writing about her
for over a year

190
00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:10.570
because she was the voice
of her generation

191
00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:12.706
spearheading a movement
for real change,

192
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.642
and in return, was mowed down
in a hit-and-run.

193
00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:18.012
There's no reason to believe
it was anything other than

194
00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:21.314
wrong time, wrong place,
bad luck.

195
00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:22.983
No. No, no, no, no, no!

196
00:16:23.017 --> 00:16:26.286
Oh! God.

197
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.788
That's gonna cost me a few quid.

198
00:16:27.822 --> 00:16:29.322
The SUV had no plates.

199
00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.967
The rideshare driver
was using a fake name.

200
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.760
That's sketchy.

201
00:16:35.295 --> 00:16:37.630
Okay, so the SUV
was probably new.

202
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.466
And I don't know,
the rideshare guy

203
00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.609
was an illegal immigrant
who couldn't use his real name.

204
00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.836
Who's to say?

205
00:16:41.869 --> 00:16:43.771
If we don't post something
and make it news,

206
00:16:43.804 --> 00:16:46.306
it'll be like it never happened.

207
00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:48.008
That may be true.

208
00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:49.744
What you wrote isn't.

209
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:53.013
Look, I appreciate your
enthusiasm for the movement,

210
00:16:53.047 --> 00:16:54.481
I really do.

211
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.017
But news stories
are based on facts.

212
00:16:57.051 --> 00:16:58.719
Find them first

213
00:16:58.753 --> 00:17:00.320
then write your story.

214
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.867
Hey, buddy,
you can't park here.

215
00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:48.701
Okay.

216
00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:50.738
Yeah, yeah...

217
00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:52.605
I... I'll move it.

218
00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.811
Gun! Put your hands up!

219
00:17:56.844 --> 00:17:57.745
Look, I can explain.

220
00:17:57.778 --> 00:18:00.781
Show 'em!
Put your hands out the window!

221
00:18:00.815 --> 00:18:02.582
Step out of the vehicle.

222
00:18:04.617 --> 00:18:06.486
Put your hands on your head.

223
00:18:08.388 --> 00:18:10.724
Do not move.

224
00:18:43.991 --> 00:18:45.692
Freeze, asshole!

225
00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:52.632
You keep up
this routine,

226
00:18:52.665 --> 00:18:55.535
there's no way
you're walking out of here.

227
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.043
I'm here to help,
but to do that properly,

228
00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:06.013
I need more information.

229
00:19:06.046 --> 00:19:08.615
What were you planning on doing?

230
00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:17.490
The police found booze, pills
and a handgun in your vehicle.

231
00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:22.162
Were you thinking of putting
a round in your brainpan?

232
00:19:22.196 --> 00:19:23.197
No.

233
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.765
Maybe you had a score to settle.

234
00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:26.100
Were you there to kill someone?

235
00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:27.835
- No.
- Rob a jewelry store?

236
00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:29.511
Look, I wasn't gonna do anything
with the gun.

237
00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.005
I was keeping it in the car.

238
00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:32.172
On the passenger seat?

239
00:19:32.206 --> 00:19:34.108
I wasn't thinking straight,
okay?

240
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.442
Are you now?

241
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.417
Alright, Dusty. My time's up.

242
00:19:45.953 --> 00:19:49.723
You're welcome to stay, or we
can stroll out of here together.

243
00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:53.626
But to do that,
you'll need to level with me.

244
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.964
What were you doing?

245
00:20:02.236 --> 00:20:04.939
I was going to talk
to a reporter.

246
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.950
Sign here for Dusty Crane.

247
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:19.987
Mike, uh, let's just say
this one was never here, yeah?

248
00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:25.993
Thanks.

249
00:20:30.998 --> 00:20:34.701
- Where to, boss?
- A nice, quiet secure place.

250
00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.103
Where I get reprogrammed?

251
00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:40.007
Where you can screw your
priorities back on straight.

252
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.675
And after that they'll assign me
to some small town field office

253
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:43.853
where they can keep an eye on me

254
00:20:43.877 --> 00:20:45.611
while my soul slowly dies,
right?

255
00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:47.081
Or you work through this
speed bump

256
00:20:47.114 --> 00:20:51.018
in order to salvage what's left
of your promising career.

257
00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:52.652
I like you, Dusty.

258
00:20:52.685 --> 00:20:54.855
I like your passion. I like your
commitment to the job.

259
00:20:54.888 --> 00:20:56.800
But you were on the verge of
making a bad choice.

260
00:20:56.824 --> 00:20:58.735
No, it wasn't a bad choice,
it was the right choice.

261
00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:00.660
Wrong. You took an oath.

262
00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:02.595
You need to honor that.

263
00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.764
Listen, work with me

264
00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.032
and I'll spin it with Robinson

265
00:21:05.065 --> 00:21:06.532
as best I can.

266
00:21:06.566 --> 00:21:07.735
Get you back on track.

267
00:21:07.768 --> 00:21:09.136
Oh, you don't get it, Block.

268
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:10.871
It's gone too far.

269
00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:12.681
We're crossing lines that should
never be crossed.

270
00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.707
Guys like you and me,
we don't decide

271
00:21:14.742 --> 00:21:16.176
where those lines are drawn.

272
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.079
The only thing you need to know
is whose orders you follow.

273
00:21:21.081 --> 00:21:23.751
Your loyalties lie
on the wrong side of the future.

274
00:21:23.784 --> 00:21:26.020
I don't expect everyone
to cope with the mind games

275
00:21:26.053 --> 00:21:28.088
that come with
deep undercover work.

276
00:21:28.122 --> 00:21:30.024
Once you're in it,
it's hard to tell

277
00:21:30.057 --> 00:21:33.093
which way is up, down,
right, wrong.

278
00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:34.728
But you're an intelligent guy

279
00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:36.864
and I do expect you
to cope with it.

280
00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:40.834
You do whatever you gotta do
to me.

281
00:21:40.868 --> 00:21:43.170
I'm not playing
by the Bureau's rules anymore.

282
00:21:43.203 --> 00:21:44.905
We'll see about that.

283
00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:51.644
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

284
00:21:59.953 --> 00:22:02.089
This where my
re-education begins?

285
00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:05.926
Wrist.

286
00:22:15.635 --> 00:22:18.372
- Grandpa!
- Hey, sweetie.

287
00:22:18.405 --> 00:22:21.175
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

288
00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:22.776
I needed that hug.

289
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.678
It's okay.
I know you have to work.

290
00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:29.349
Yeah. Um, you here
all by yourself?

291
00:22:29.383 --> 00:22:31.351
Well, not anymore.

292
00:22:31.385 --> 00:22:32.953
Ready to go?
It's our night.

293
00:22:32.986 --> 00:22:35.688
But when you didn't
answer your phone,

294
00:22:35.722 --> 00:22:39.126
Miss Lewis called mommy
at the hospital.

295
00:22:39.159 --> 00:22:43.063
So now I'm supposed to sit tight
and wait for her.

296
00:22:43.097 --> 00:22:45.099
Oh, I see.

297
00:22:45.132 --> 00:22:48.802
But that doesn't mean
you can't stay here with me.

298
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:54.007
Uh... it certainly doesn't.

299
00:23:00.013 --> 00:23:02.082
Hey, kid!

300
00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:03.750
Come here.

301
00:23:04.418 --> 00:23:06.120
You a criminal?

302
00:23:06.153 --> 00:23:08.956
If it's... if it's a crime to
speak the truth, buddy,

303
00:23:08.989 --> 00:23:10.224
then, yes, I am.

304
00:23:12.092 --> 00:23:14.094
Uh, hey, no, I wouldn't do that.

305
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:19.967
I like those buttons, though.
Can I see one of those?

306
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.668
Looks like a fun picnic.

307
00:23:22.702 --> 00:23:23.837
Who are these two?

308
00:23:23.871 --> 00:23:26.106
This is me, and that's mommy.

309
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.976
Of course, which means
that must be me.

310
00:23:29.009 --> 00:23:32.846
No, you silly bean.
That's a stranger.

311
00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:39.753
What, what's a stranger doing?

312
00:23:39.786 --> 00:23:41.388
Watching us.

313
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:42.990
Watching you? Why?

314
00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:44.291
Has someone been watching you?

315
00:23:44.324 --> 00:23:45.726
I don't know.

316
00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:47.761
I need you to know.

317
00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:54.001
I'm sorry, Natalie. It's okay.

318
00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:56.303
It's just very important for you
always to be aware,

319
00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:57.771
like I've taught you.

320
00:23:57.804 --> 00:23:59.173
But I am.

321
00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:01.041
And tell me if anyone

322
00:24:01.074 --> 00:24:03.477
strange comes up to you,
approaches you.

323
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:05.312
Okay, I will.

324
00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:06.847
Good girl. Thank you.

325
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.116
Are bad guys gonna hurt you?

326
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:10.851
Hurt me? Nah.

327
00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:12.152
Why would you think that?

328
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:15.022
Because mommy says
your job is dangerous.

329
00:24:15.055 --> 00:24:18.258
Don't worry.
She exaggerates.

330
00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:19.993
It's not that dangerous.

331
00:24:20.027 --> 00:24:23.931
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
or you.

332
00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:26.033
- Or mommy?
- Or mommy.

333
00:24:27.868 --> 00:24:30.204
Mommy!

334
00:24:30.237 --> 00:24:32.839
Hi, sweetie. Grandpa.

335
00:24:45.986 --> 00:24:48.355
Dusty! Don't do this!

336
00:24:53.894 --> 00:24:55.229
I think you have an admirer.

337
00:24:55.262 --> 00:24:57.331
Does he live in a castle
and have a heart of gold?

338
00:24:57.364 --> 00:24:58.799
He's on line three.

339
00:24:58.832 --> 00:25:00.443
Says your last few articles
on Sofia Flores

340
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:01.902
were inspirational.

341
00:25:01.935 --> 00:25:03.146
Was Prince Charming
slurring his words?

342
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.771
Claims he can guarantee you
a story

343
00:25:04.805 --> 00:25:07.975
worthy of a dozen
clickbait headlines.

344
00:25:08.008 --> 00:25:10.110
- Just tell me what it is.
- No.

345
00:25:10.143 --> 00:25:12.112
No, it's too dangerous
to do over the phone.

346
00:25:12.145 --> 00:25:14.014
They're listening.
They're always listening.

347
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.361
I'm gonna come to you,
we'll find some place quiet

348
00:25:18.385 --> 00:25:20.087
to talk about it.

349
00:25:24.291 --> 00:25:26.493
- When?
- How about five minutes?

350
00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:53.420
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

351
00:25:53.453 --> 00:25:54.788
No!

352
00:25:58.091 --> 00:26:00.093
- Look out!
- Move!

353
00:26:14.608 --> 00:26:16.009
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:26:16.043 --> 00:26:17.911
I'm going to free my conscience!

355
00:26:17.944 --> 00:26:20.013
Watch out!

356
00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:11.164
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Hey!

357
00:27:11.198 --> 00:27:12.399
Stop!

358
00:27:37.357 --> 00:27:39.292
No, no, no, no, no!

359
00:28:32.078 --> 00:28:33.447
- Are you Mira?
- Yeah, you are?

360
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.449
Being followed.
Let's go somewhere private.

361
00:28:35.482 --> 00:28:38.018
Wait! What exactly is this
all about?

362
00:28:38.051 --> 00:28:39.419
Look, this is really important.

363
00:28:39.453 --> 00:28:41.264
We're gonna have to do this
another time, okay?

364
00:28:41.288 --> 00:28:42.656
No, wait!

365
00:29:16.223 --> 00:29:17.400
The last person
on the planet

366
00:29:17.424 --> 00:29:20.527
I need talking to the
press is Crane.

367
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.296
He should be
in a secure mental facility.

368
00:29:25.699 --> 00:29:27.634
Natalie's school?

369
00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:30.103
What the hell were you thinking?

370
00:29:30.136 --> 00:29:32.239
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

371
00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:34.674
Bad timing. Poor judgement.

372
00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:36.376
He say anything to you?

373
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:39.613
He was having a moral code
moment.

374
00:29:39.646 --> 00:29:41.348
Said we were crossing the line.

375
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:44.785
Must feel nice to be that naive.

376
00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:46.119
Is that all?

377
00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:47.554
Just that he's done following

378
00:29:47.587 --> 00:29:48.789
the Bureau's rules,

379
00:29:48.823 --> 00:29:52.793
and based on his little
truck stunt...

380
00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:54.261
I tend to believe him.

381
00:29:54.294 --> 00:29:56.396
He's a live grenade.

382
00:29:56.429 --> 00:29:58.131
This one makes it
to the front page,

383
00:29:58.164 --> 00:29:59.834
I'm gonna catch heat
from every direction.

384
00:29:59.867 --> 00:30:02.569
Stupid thing!

385
00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:06.406
I haven't properly worn one of
these since Margaret passed.

386
00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:09.810
- Yeah, she had a gift.
- That she did.

387
00:30:09.844 --> 00:30:12.245
Bless her soul.

388
00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:16.383
Letting Crane slip through your
fingers, not like you.

389
00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:20.220
Are you alright?

390
00:30:20.253 --> 00:30:22.757
Yeah, I've just been feeling
a bit distracted.

391
00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.760
Well, no need to
hold it in with me, buddy.

392
00:30:25.793 --> 00:30:27.527
What's the trouble?

393
00:30:27.561 --> 00:30:30.697
I'm trying to spend more time
with Natalie.

394
00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:32.733
And?

395
00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:36.269
At this point, Amanda doesn't
trust me, for good reason.

396
00:30:36.303 --> 00:30:37.838
I need to change that.

397
00:30:37.872 --> 00:30:40.073
Anything I can do to help?

398
00:30:41.742 --> 00:30:43.878
Actually, Gabe...

399
00:30:43.911 --> 00:30:45.846
I've been thinking.

400
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.148
Maybe it's time I hang it up.

401
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:51.451
No. No, no, no.

402
00:30:51.484 --> 00:30:52.853
Not an option.

403
00:30:52.887 --> 00:30:55.255
The thing is,
it's been over 20 years

404
00:30:55.288 --> 00:30:56.857
of the unpredictable.

405
00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:58.491
Never knowing
when you're gonna call

406
00:30:58.525 --> 00:31:00.895
where you're gonna send me
and for how long.

407
00:31:00.928 --> 00:31:03.263
Which has made relationships
difficult.

408
00:31:03.296 --> 00:31:06.466
And now... Natalie needs
stability in her life,

409
00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:08.234
and I want to be that for her.

410
00:31:08.268 --> 00:31:10.905
I appreciate the importance
of family, God knows.

411
00:31:10.938 --> 00:31:12.472
Look at me.

412
00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:17.377
But what you do is crucial,
important work.

413
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.646
Our people
go to dangerous places,

414
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:21.615
physically and mentally.

415
00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:23.350
And when they go astray,

416
00:31:23.383 --> 00:31:26.754
I need you to bring them back

417
00:31:26.787 --> 00:31:29.122
before they grow horns.

418
00:31:30.457 --> 00:31:33.226
Saving good agents' souls.

419
00:31:33.259 --> 00:31:35.362
Whatever it takes.

420
00:31:37.832 --> 00:31:39.499
I'll tell you what.

421
00:31:39.532 --> 00:31:42.702
Once Dusty's in a cell
and I have the key,

422
00:31:42.737 --> 00:31:45.372
we'll work out a way
for you to spend more time

423
00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:47.875
with your granddaughter.

424
00:31:47.908 --> 00:31:49.342
Deal?

425
00:31:52.445 --> 00:31:54.849
Out of curiosity,
I pulled our security footage

426
00:31:54.882 --> 00:31:56.616
from when I met this guy.

427
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.184
Uh, do you have a name?

428
00:31:58.218 --> 00:31:59.562
No, but our security guards
recognized him.

429
00:31:59.586 --> 00:32:01.254
It's the same guy
who was arrested

430
00:32:01.287 --> 00:32:03.423
for fighting the cops
across the street.

431
00:32:03.456 --> 00:32:05.793
Your fighter's your runner?

432
00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:08.328
You've looked better.
Did you sleep at all last night?

433
00:32:08.361 --> 00:32:10.330
Define sleep.

434
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:12.733
You know you can just
record your stupid games

435
00:32:12.767 --> 00:32:14.634
and watch them later.

436
00:32:14.668 --> 00:32:16.503
That's rather like
jumping to the belly ache

437
00:32:16.536 --> 00:32:17.948
after you've overeaten
without actually

438
00:32:17.972 --> 00:32:20.674
enjoying the cake first.

439
00:32:20.707 --> 00:32:24.244
I checked every police station
within 50 miles of here.

440
00:32:24.277 --> 00:32:27.514
No record of his arrest.

441
00:32:27.547 --> 00:32:29.482
This feels like another
Mira special.

442
00:32:29.516 --> 00:32:31.284
You don't find that strange?

443
00:32:31.317 --> 00:32:32.686
Maybe they just let him go

444
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.554
to avoid another police
brutality charge.

445
00:32:34.587 --> 00:32:37.223
He beat the crap
out of four cops.

446
00:32:40.593 --> 00:32:42.629
Okay. Maybe you're right.

447
00:32:44.832 --> 00:32:46.767
So, what's the headline?

448
00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:50.805
I didn't say I have a draft,
or even an angle. I just...

449
00:32:50.838 --> 00:32:54.574
He contacted me.
He could be a legitimate source.

450
00:32:54.607 --> 00:32:56.609
Or a nutcase
wanting to go viral.

451
00:33:32.012 --> 00:33:36.449
So... no bank
or credit card activity?

452
00:33:37.985 --> 00:33:40.320
Okay, what about
under Dusty's alias?

453
00:33:40.353 --> 00:33:42.923
His last known cover was...

454
00:33:42.957 --> 00:33:45.592
Uh-huh. I see.

455
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:48.495
Well, keep an eye on it,
will ya?

456
00:33:48.528 --> 00:33:49.662
Thanks.

457
00:34:06.013 --> 00:34:09.884
No, you silly bean,
that's a stranger...

458
00:34:15.089 --> 00:34:17.423
Watching us...

459
00:34:21.729 --> 00:34:24.732
- Got him?
- Oh, yeah.

460
00:34:24.765 --> 00:34:25.800
Grandpa!

461
00:34:25.833 --> 00:34:28.601
Hey, pumpkin.
Where have you been?

462
00:34:28.635 --> 00:34:30.537
At the park,
flying my kite.

463
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.373
Oh, that sounds fun.
You get it high up in the air?

464
00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:36.643
Not really.
I couldn't run fast enough.

465
00:34:36.676 --> 00:34:40.413
- But mommy did.
- Oh, good job, mommy.

466
00:34:40.446 --> 00:34:42.415
Go inside and wash up
for dinner, please.

467
00:34:42.448 --> 00:34:44.517
Can you stay and eat with us?

468
00:34:44.551 --> 00:34:46.921
We're having homemade pizza.

469
00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:48.856
Oh, I love pizza.

470
00:34:50.891 --> 00:34:52.592
Pizza it is.

471
00:34:54.128 --> 00:34:56.764
That was four times.

472
00:34:56.797 --> 00:34:58.766
Four? Are you sure?

473
00:34:58.799 --> 00:35:02.402
Oh, go again.
One, two, three.

474
00:35:05.672 --> 00:35:07.707
What are you doing?

475
00:35:07.741 --> 00:35:10.110
Ah, installing security cameras.

476
00:35:10.144 --> 00:35:11.712
On my house?

477
00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:13.781
For Natalie's safety.
And yours.

478
00:35:13.814 --> 00:35:15.582
I know that I should just say
thank you,

479
00:35:15.615 --> 00:35:18.551
and... some might consider that
very sweet of you,

480
00:35:18.585 --> 00:35:20.120
but you can't do
things like this

481
00:35:20.154 --> 00:35:21.722
without asking my permission.

482
00:35:21.755 --> 00:35:23.389
I was concerned
you would say no.

483
00:35:23.423 --> 00:35:24.792
And you'd probably be right.

484
00:35:24.825 --> 00:35:26.927
She's drawing pictures
of strangers, watching her.

485
00:35:26.961 --> 00:35:30.496
And what do you think is
feeding her growing paranoia?

486
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.868
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

487
00:35:33.901 --> 00:35:37.872
And I admit it. I screwed up
on multiple occasions.

488
00:35:37.905 --> 00:35:39.874
But you've got to know,
I'm trying to fix things.

489
00:35:39.907 --> 00:35:42.810
Natalie doesn't need a fixer
like you.

490
00:35:45.212 --> 00:35:47.047
You sound just like your mother.

491
00:35:47.081 --> 00:35:49.482
Before or after she left us?

492
00:35:55.089 --> 00:35:56.522
I'm worried about you, dad.

493
00:35:56.556 --> 00:35:58.058
There's nothing to worry about.

494
00:35:58.092 --> 00:35:59.559
That's why I'm worried.

495
00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.861
Because maybe you can't see it,

496
00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:04.164
but you're not the same dad
that I remember.

497
00:36:04.198 --> 00:36:05.474
You know,
when I was Natalie's age,

498
00:36:05.498 --> 00:36:06.800
your quirks were cute.

499
00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:09.036
Getting my bicycle serviced
every few months.

500
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:11.638
Waking up at 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
to make sure all the doors

501
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:13.040
and windows were still locked,

502
00:36:13.073 --> 00:36:16.176
and getting background checks
on my friends' parents.

503
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.645
Your quirks
aren't quirks anymore.

504
00:36:18.678 --> 00:36:22.850
You need to accept that
and you need to deal with it.

505
00:36:22.883 --> 00:36:24.517
I sometimes wonder

506
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.619
did the disorder change you

507
00:36:26.653 --> 00:36:28.856
or was it your dirty job?

508
00:36:32.558 --> 00:36:34.895
Finish with the cameras.

509
00:36:34.929 --> 00:36:37.798
So please don't do anything else
without asking first.

510
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:53.513
Can I get
either of you gentlemen

511
00:36:53.546 --> 00:36:54.982
something to drink?

512
00:36:56.516 --> 00:36:58.618
No thank you, ma'am.

513
00:37:04.058 --> 00:37:06.060
Special Agent Lockhart.

514
00:37:06.093 --> 00:37:07.728
Special Agent Wallace.

515
00:37:07.761 --> 00:37:09.229
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

516
00:37:09.263 --> 00:37:10.998
Come in.

517
00:37:36.622 --> 00:37:38.092
Don't let baggy pants
get to you.

518
00:37:38.125 --> 00:37:41.527
I just can't believe Sarah falls
for his blatant ass-kissing.

519
00:37:41.561 --> 00:37:43.163
She's too smart for that.

520
00:37:43.197 --> 00:37:45.799
My take is, she enjoys it.

521
00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:47.901
Found this on the police wire.

522
00:37:47.935 --> 00:37:50.871
- Is that your guy?
- I think it is.

523
00:37:54.707 --> 00:37:58.278
Not exactly a dream date.
But he is kinda hot.

524
00:37:58.312 --> 00:38:00.014
Wanted by
the DC Police Department.

525
00:38:00.047 --> 00:38:02.916
Considered armed
and mentally unstable.

526
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:05.719
Hm, I wonder if I should be
curious or scared

527
00:38:05.753 --> 00:38:07.054
about what he wanted to tell me.

528
00:38:07.087 --> 00:38:09.056
Probably both.

529
00:38:11.657 --> 00:38:13.526
"Possession."

530
00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:18.132
"Disturbing the peace.

531
00:38:18.165 --> 00:38:20.100
Assault with a deadly weapon."

532
00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:36.616
Mira Jones?

533
00:38:38.018 --> 00:38:38.852
Maybe.

534
00:38:38.886 --> 00:38:41.822
I have information
about your story.

535
00:38:41.855 --> 00:38:43.957
The one that ran away.

536
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.632
- You have a name, Agent?
- I'm not an agent.

537
00:38:52.665 --> 00:38:55.169
This isn't an interview.
Please, turn it off.

538
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.639
- Who is he?
- You tell me.

539
00:38:59.672 --> 00:39:03.210
- Why were you meeting him?
- Why did you chase him away?

540
00:39:03.243 --> 00:39:05.578
Has he contacted you again?

541
00:39:07.948 --> 00:39:09.249
Listen.

542
00:39:09.283 --> 00:39:11.385
He's wanted on multiple counts.

543
00:39:11.418 --> 00:39:13.020
If you know where he is,

544
00:39:13.053 --> 00:39:14.955
you're an accessory
after the fact.

545
00:39:14.988 --> 00:39:17.958
Oh, well, thank you for
stopping by and informing me.

546
00:39:17.991 --> 00:39:21.962
I think Little Man's finished,
Mr. Not-An-Agent.

547
00:39:21.995 --> 00:39:25.099
The man needs professional help.
He's unbalanced.

548
00:39:25.132 --> 00:39:28.869
Yeah, I read all about
our friend Dusty's problems.

549
00:39:30.003 --> 00:39:31.371
Guess you don't
have a subscription

550
00:39:31.405 --> 00:39:33.040
to the police wire.

551
00:39:33.073 --> 00:39:34.707
He's on the police wire?

552
00:39:34.741 --> 00:39:36.343
Are we done?

553
00:39:36.376 --> 00:39:38.712
I think we're done.

554
00:39:38.745 --> 00:39:40.848
I don't know
what his intentions were

555
00:39:40.881 --> 00:39:43.117
or why he made contact with you.

556
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.985
But let me be clear.

557
00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:48.021
He's not a source for you to
make your fledgling career on.

558
00:39:48.055 --> 00:39:50.891
- Let it go.
- Okay, this is intimidation.

559
00:39:50.924 --> 00:39:54.128
And you know nothing about me
or my fledgling career.

560
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:57.164
Name "James Van Dorn"
mean anything to you?

561
00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:01.401
No.

562
00:40:01.435 --> 00:40:05.005
Mr. Van Dorn and his wife lived
in a comfortable six-bedroom

563
00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:08.108
brownstone across
from Montrose Park.

564
00:40:08.142 --> 00:40:10.410
Plenty of room for them
and their three kids.

565
00:40:10.444 --> 00:40:12.146
But that wasn't enough for him.

566
00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:14.348
He also had a thing
for his secretary.

567
00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:18.252
He made a mistake, had a
daughter, whom he disowned.

568
00:40:18.285 --> 00:40:22.322
She's... probably about 30 now.

569
00:40:22.356 --> 00:40:23.724
A struggling journalist

570
00:40:23.757 --> 00:40:26.026
who lives in a
shoebox-sized apartment

571
00:40:26.059 --> 00:40:27.895
and writes under a pseudonym

572
00:40:27.928 --> 00:40:31.798
because her father demanded
she spare him the embarrassment.

573
00:40:31.832 --> 00:40:33.033
Get out of my way.

574
00:40:33.066 --> 00:40:35.936
Quoting a source who isn't sane

575
00:40:35.969 --> 00:40:39.873
could get you sued
for libel or fired.

576
00:40:39.907 --> 00:40:43.277
Although, in this case,
I'd say both are probable.

577
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.478
There's no story here.

578
00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:46.213
- Says who?
- Says me.

579
00:40:47.781 --> 00:40:49.917
Okay.

580
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:51.084
Thanks.

581
00:40:52.452 --> 00:40:55.155
For confirming that
there is a story. Goodnight.

582
00:40:56.924 --> 00:41:01.128
He contacts you, you contact me.
Got it?

583
00:41:01.161 --> 00:41:05.499
Take my word for it.
Don't play news hero.

584
00:41:05.532 --> 00:41:07.100
Don't.

585
00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:37.097
Dusty, we don't want trouble.

586
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.998
Too late.

587
00:41:38.031 --> 00:41:39.499
Robinson just wants to talk.

588
00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:43.403
Let us take you to him. You two
can work out your differences.

589
00:41:43.437 --> 00:41:44.471
Good plan.

590
00:42:44.865 --> 00:42:48.001
The FBI shows up at my
door and tries to intimidate me

591
00:42:48.035 --> 00:42:52.039
because this mentally unstable
guy contacted me?

592
00:42:52.072 --> 00:42:53.874
Maybe he's not
so crazy after all.

593
00:42:53.907 --> 00:42:55.208
You sure he's a Fed?

594
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:59.146
The whole thing smells
a tad unusual.

595
00:43:00.013 --> 00:43:02.316
Do you... do you want me
to check it out?

596
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:04.451
No, I got it.

597
00:43:04.484 --> 00:43:06.286
Okay.

598
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.622
But you might want to start
adding some actual detail

599
00:43:08.655 --> 00:43:10.057
because right now,
the only story

600
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.392
you're writing is in your head.

601
00:43:12.426 --> 00:43:15.162
Are you implying that
I'm the crazy one?

602
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.067
No. You're the eager one.

603
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.936
Listen, if there is a story
to be found here,

604
00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:24.347
you'll need to take note
of the obvious

605
00:43:24.371 --> 00:43:27.441
and then scrutinize what the
obvious obscures

606
00:43:27.474 --> 00:43:29.042
like an ultra-violet light

607
00:43:29.076 --> 00:43:32.079
illuminating what the
naked eye can't see.

608
00:43:32.112 --> 00:43:37.117
But if you do find something,
tread lightly.

609
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.385
You've got a call.

610
00:43:38.418 --> 00:43:40.087
Just a minute.

611
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.621
It's your secret admirer.

612
00:43:44.524 --> 00:43:45.859
This is Mira.

613
00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:46.052
Government,
even in its best state,

614
00:44:46.086 --> 00:44:49.556
is but a necessary evil.

615
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:54.127
In its worst state,
it's an intolerable evil.

616
00:44:54.161 --> 00:44:56.196
Now you might think
these words were said

617
00:44:56.229 --> 00:44:59.399
last night on a podcast
or a news program

618
00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:03.370
about today's state of
the world, but you'd be wrong.

619
00:45:03.403 --> 00:45:08.475
Those words were written by
Thomas Paine in 1776.

620
00:45:30.497 --> 00:45:32.699
Move! Go, go, go!

621
00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:34.434
Hey!

622
00:45:49.784 --> 00:45:51.184
We got him.

623
00:45:51.218 --> 00:45:53.086
Sir, you need to slow down.

624
00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:54.488
I promise you,
this is a bad idea.

625
00:46:31.324 --> 00:46:32.526
Enough, Dusty!

626
00:46:43.303 --> 00:46:46.072
- Time to come in.
- Just like that?

627
00:46:46.106 --> 00:46:47.517
After you sent those two
shitheads to kill me?

628
00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:50.477
What? I didn't send anyone
to do anything to you.

629
00:46:55.181 --> 00:46:56.516
What shitheads?

630
00:46:57.684 --> 00:46:59.553
You can't bullshit me!

631
00:47:21.174 --> 00:47:22.843
You're slipping.

632
00:47:22.877 --> 00:47:24.845
You're losing your edge.

633
00:47:24.879 --> 00:47:27.113
It's not too late.

634
00:47:27.147 --> 00:47:29.616
I can help you come back with
dignity. Get your life back.

635
00:47:29.649 --> 00:47:31.418
I'm done with that life.

636
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:33.186
You can't run far enough.

637
00:47:33.219 --> 00:47:36.323
They'll find you,
cut you off at the knees.

638
00:47:36.356 --> 00:47:37.801
Whatever you're
telling this journalist,

639
00:47:37.825 --> 00:47:39.259
they'll call it treason.

640
00:47:39.292 --> 00:47:41.328
- That's 30 to life.
- I can live with that.

641
00:47:41.361 --> 00:47:44.431
No. You're not
thinking straight.

642
00:47:44.464 --> 00:47:47.334
It was all part of the job.
You just got in too deep.

643
00:47:47.367 --> 00:47:48.644
Well, deep enough
to see the truth.

644
00:47:48.668 --> 00:47:50.303
We're killing
innocent civilians.

645
00:47:50.337 --> 00:47:52.472
People that are
trying to make a difference!

646
00:47:52.505 --> 00:47:54.708
- Who's we?
- The Bureau.

647
00:47:54.742 --> 00:47:56.777
And you know this how?

648
00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:02.315
Because I was one of the agents
ordered to do the killing.

649
00:48:03.751 --> 00:48:07.120
Innocent civilians?
Under whose orders?

650
00:48:08.655 --> 00:48:10.357
Robinson's.

651
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.492
That's a serious accusation.

652
00:48:15.195 --> 00:48:16.363
I'm going to prove it.

653
00:48:16.396 --> 00:48:18.498
Listen, I wanna hear
all about it.

654
00:48:18.531 --> 00:48:20.200
Dusty. Dusty!

655
00:49:02.777 --> 00:49:04.678
What just happened?

656
00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.820
Do you know who those men were?

657
00:49:08.849 --> 00:49:10.818
No, do... do you?

658
00:49:10.851 --> 00:49:11.952
What did Dusty say to you?

659
00:49:11.986 --> 00:49:14.722
Uh, he... he was bringing...

660
00:49:14.755 --> 00:49:17.457
Bringing you what?
What was he bringing you?

661
00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:20.560
This is all my fault.

662
00:49:20.593 --> 00:49:23.764
Mira, look at me.
Tell me what it was.

663
00:49:25.733 --> 00:49:26.801
Documents.

664
00:49:26.834 --> 00:49:27.935
What kind of documents?

665
00:49:27.968 --> 00:49:29.469
His orders.

666
00:49:31.005 --> 00:49:32.472
Proof.

667
00:50:15.548 --> 00:50:17.383
Something on your mind?

668
00:50:19.053 --> 00:50:22.455
It's a sad day, no doubt.

669
00:50:22.489 --> 00:50:24.058
Well, let's be honest.

670
00:50:24.091 --> 00:50:26.493
The kid had a few
too many loose screws.

671
00:50:26.526 --> 00:50:29.362
Or he had a bright future,
until something...

672
00:50:31.065 --> 00:50:34.367
or someone pushed him too far.

673
00:50:36.703 --> 00:50:38.739
Still don't know
who those two men were?

674
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:42.342
No. At this point,
we still don't know.

675
00:50:43.643 --> 00:50:46.080
He was one of the good guys.

676
00:50:46.113 --> 00:50:47.915
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

677
00:50:47.948 --> 00:50:52.086
Well, unfortunately for him,
you got distracted.

678
00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:54.088
If you'd done your job,

679
00:50:54.121 --> 00:50:56.289
we wouldn't be wearing
these suits today.

680
00:50:57.457 --> 00:50:59.760
It's tragic,
but now it's finished.

681
00:50:59.794 --> 00:51:02.529
Let's point our focus back
where it needs to be.

682
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:05.833
Plenty more souls to save.

683
00:51:07.768 --> 00:51:09.335
Yeah.

684
00:51:24.718 --> 00:51:26.954
What are you watching, grandpa?

685
00:51:26.987 --> 00:51:29.522
Oh, nothing, sweetie.

686
00:51:29.556 --> 00:51:32.692
Hey, you and Lambie
should be in bed.

687
00:51:32.726 --> 00:51:34.929
I can't sleep.

688
00:51:34.962 --> 00:51:37.330
Uh-huh? Come here.

689
00:51:38.966 --> 00:51:40.134
Attagirl.

690
00:51:40.167 --> 00:51:42.435
Thinking about your big play?

691
00:51:42.468 --> 00:51:43.703
Everything okay?

692
00:51:43.737 --> 00:51:46.606
I think I'm worried about you.

693
00:51:46.639 --> 00:51:49.676
Me? You sound like your mother.

694
00:51:49.710 --> 00:51:51.411
There's nothing to worry about.

695
00:51:54.915 --> 00:51:57.117
Well...

696
00:51:57.151 --> 00:52:00.620
You know...
some people live

697
00:52:00.653 --> 00:52:03.724
their entire lives thinking
they're doing the right thing...

698
00:52:05.025 --> 00:52:09.964
even if it means doing
whatever is proper...

699
00:52:11.464 --> 00:52:13.834
to make sure the good guys
always win.

700
00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:19.740
But then, one day
you wake up and realize...

701
00:52:19.773 --> 00:52:22.743
you're not sure who the
good guys are anymore.

702
00:52:23.744 --> 00:52:25.713
Which makes you wonder...

703
00:52:27.647 --> 00:52:29.717
have I been doing
the right thing?

704
00:52:30.784 --> 00:52:31.886
Am I a good guy?

705
00:52:32.987 --> 00:52:34.454
Grandpa?

706
00:52:35.189 --> 00:52:37.457
Are you a good guy?

707
00:52:41.862 --> 00:52:43.596
I wanna be.

708
00:53:04.919 --> 00:53:07.553
You're not doing anywhere
worthwhile here.

709
00:53:08.756 --> 00:53:10.190
Go home.

710
00:53:10.224 --> 00:53:11.959
Take a couple of days.

711
00:53:13.093 --> 00:53:14.527
Mira.

712
00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:18.665
Home. Go.

713
00:53:24.671 --> 00:53:26.807
- Mira.
- Oh, hey.

714
00:53:28.275 --> 00:53:29.944
Are... are you following me?

715
00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:31.078
No.

716
00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:33.546
But I did wanna come see you.

717
00:53:33.579 --> 00:53:35.448
How're you holding up?

718
00:53:36.683 --> 00:53:38.786
- Not so good.
- Yeah.

719
00:53:40.553 --> 00:53:42.856
You, uh, you like whiskey?

720
00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:47.560
This everything Dusty told you?

721
00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:48.862
That's it.

722
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.699
What's this "Operation U?"

723
00:53:52.733 --> 00:53:54.567
Unity. Operation Unity.

724
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.937
Did he say what its mission is?

725
00:54:05.112 --> 00:54:06.847
These are picked up.

726
00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:11.118
Are you being followed?

727
00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:12.685
Maybe.

728
00:54:15.756 --> 00:54:19.592
Long story short, he was a
deep cover agent in Miami.

729
00:54:19.625 --> 00:54:22.830
Got sniffy with the cocaine
he was tracking.

730
00:54:22.863 --> 00:54:25.232
When I found him, he was
in the Everglades,

731
00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:27.901
wrestling an alligator
for sport.

732
00:54:29.269 --> 00:54:30.603
Interesting friend.

733
00:54:30.636 --> 00:54:32.605
Not a friend. Debtor.

734
00:54:32.638 --> 00:54:34.875
- For?
- Saving his life.

735
00:54:36.642 --> 00:54:38.644
How long you been doing that?

736
00:54:39.813 --> 00:54:42.548
Oh, probably too long.

737
00:54:52.826 --> 00:54:54.560
What's with the three thing?

738
00:54:54.594 --> 00:54:59.767
I have thoughts looping inside
my head, repeating themselves.

739
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.735
If I do something three times,

740
00:55:01.769 --> 00:55:04.138
I can usually
suppress the thought.

741
00:55:04.171 --> 00:55:05.705
Obsessive compulsive.

742
00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:10.610
Sometimes the obsessing makes me
better at what I do.

743
00:55:10.643 --> 00:55:13.047
Other times...

744
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.083
Other times, I feel like I
should be locked away.

745
00:55:19.219 --> 00:55:20.821
What happened to you?

746
00:55:24.358 --> 00:55:27.660
I... screwed up.

747
00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:32.565
I served one tour in Vietnam.
I wasn't even 20.

748
00:55:33.233 --> 00:55:36.636
April 1975.

749
00:55:36.669 --> 00:55:37.847
It was the night before
we pulled out

750
00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:39.705
all our troops and went home.

751
00:55:41.308 --> 00:55:43.609
I was on patrol duty
with Robinson...

752
00:55:43.643 --> 00:55:44.912
Director of the FBI?

753
00:55:44.945 --> 00:55:47.948
The younger version, yes.

754
00:55:47.981 --> 00:55:51.684
We were talking about everything
we would do when we got home.

755
00:55:51.718 --> 00:55:53.686
Then we turned a corner
into a dark alley,

756
00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:57.357
and there was this man
about to...

757
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:59.927
rape a local woman.

758
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.929
It was hard to see,
but it was obvious

759
00:56:01.962 --> 00:56:04.098
he was roughing her up
pretty bad.

760
00:56:05.698 --> 00:56:07.835
I called out,
and he turned towards us

761
00:56:07.868 --> 00:56:09.870
with what I thought was a gun.

762
00:56:10.838 --> 00:56:13.874
So... I shot him.

763
00:56:15.008 --> 00:56:16.143
Kill him?

764
00:56:17.277 --> 00:56:18.846
Yeah.

765
00:56:18.879 --> 00:56:20.814
Then what happened?

766
00:56:20.848 --> 00:56:22.349
The woman ran off.

767
00:56:22.382 --> 00:56:24.051
Robinson and I
went up to the guy.

768
00:56:24.084 --> 00:56:27.154
He was face down in a
puddle of his own blood.

769
00:56:28.422 --> 00:56:31.158
The gun was a bottle of whiskey.

770
00:56:31.191 --> 00:56:33.160
Robinson flipped him over.

771
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:38.899
He was our Commanding Officer.

772
00:56:38.932 --> 00:56:41.235
I panicked.
Robinson didn't.

773
00:56:41.268 --> 00:56:43.703
I can still hear his voice
like it was that night.

774
00:56:43.737 --> 00:56:45.638
"Walk away. Walk away."

775
00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.708
So I did.

776
00:56:48.742 --> 00:56:51.845
Robinson joined the FBI,
we lost touch.

777
00:56:51.879 --> 00:56:55.782
Then about 15 years went by,
and the phone rang.

778
00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:57.351
He'd just been promoted.

779
00:56:57.384 --> 00:57:02.156
Asked if I would work directly
for him, off the books.

780
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:04.892
Said it was his job
to protect the Bureau

781
00:57:04.925 --> 00:57:06.894
and mine to protect its agents.

782
00:57:06.927 --> 00:57:08.262
Off the books, that gives him

783
00:57:08.295 --> 00:57:10.297
plausible deniability for
anything you did.

784
00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:16.003
In hindsight, I suspect
I made a poor career choice.

785
00:57:16.036 --> 00:57:18.238
When you take orders for a
living, trying to support

786
00:57:18.272 --> 00:57:22.876
a family, you learn not to
question those orders...

787
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.878
regardless of the
moral implications

788
00:57:24.912 --> 00:57:28.815
or how they may affect
other people's lives.

789
00:57:31.084 --> 00:57:33.287
So, other than
intimidating journalists,

790
00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.189
what other kind of
bad stuff do you do?

791
00:57:35.222 --> 00:57:38.192
You name it,
I've probably done it.

792
00:57:38.225 --> 00:57:39.960
Like?

793
00:57:39.993 --> 00:57:42.029
Breaking and entering,
extortion.

794
00:57:42.062 --> 00:57:44.932
Occasional physical coercion.

795
00:57:44.965 --> 00:57:46.800
Murder?

796
00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:50.070
That's not on my menu.

797
00:57:53.373 --> 00:57:57.344
And for the record, I changed
my name not for my father

798
00:57:57.377 --> 00:58:00.781
and his family, but out
of respect for my mother.

799
00:58:00.814 --> 00:58:02.516
He fired her three months
after I was born.

800
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:04.051
She raised me all on her own

801
00:58:04.084 --> 00:58:07.221
and never once asked him
for anything.

802
00:58:07.254 --> 00:58:10.157
When I was old enough,
I changed my name to hers.

803
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:12.226
I stand corrected.

804
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.497
So, Mr. Block... what now?

805
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:31.311
Where did you come from?

806
00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:33.380
What's Operation Unity?

807
00:58:33.413 --> 00:58:36.116
It's nothing that concerns you.

808
00:58:36.149 --> 00:58:38.819
You know, I've always
respected my position

809
00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:43.090
in our arrangement...
but in this case,

810
00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:46.093
I prefer to be the one
who decides what concerns me.

811
00:58:47.294 --> 00:58:49.830
Unity. The truth, Gabe.

812
00:58:49.863 --> 00:58:51.965
It's not your place to know.

813
00:58:52.866 --> 00:58:55.135
Or even ask.

814
00:58:55.168 --> 00:58:58.238
So Dusty was right. You are
killing innocent people.

815
00:58:58.272 --> 00:59:01.875
You're running your own
secret program, Operation Unity.

816
00:59:01.908 --> 00:59:04.778
And when Dusty tried to go
public with it...

817
00:59:06.246 --> 00:59:07.781
you had him killed.

818
00:59:12.452 --> 00:59:14.054
Oh, please.

819
00:59:15.389 --> 00:59:18.225
We are not having this
conversation.

820
00:59:18.258 --> 00:59:19.926
Oh, yes, we are.

821
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.228
You need to come clean, Gabe.

822
00:59:21.261 --> 00:59:24.164
You're confused about
our relationship.

823
00:59:24.197 --> 00:59:27.901
You work for me.
You are my weapon.

824
00:59:27.934 --> 00:59:30.937
After all these years,
that's all I am to you?

825
00:59:31.538 --> 00:59:32.906
Jesus.

826
00:59:32.939 --> 00:59:35.542
Oh, you have a
short memory, Travis.

827
00:59:35.575 --> 00:59:39.913
It was me who plucked you
from your aimless life

828
00:59:39.946 --> 00:59:42.316
and turned you
into something special.

829
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:45.052
But don't forget, I also have a
detailed record

830
00:59:45.085 --> 00:59:47.421
of every law you've ever broken.

831
00:59:47.454 --> 00:59:50.090
Everything I did was for you!

832
00:59:50.123 --> 00:59:53.427
I would suggest you show me
a little gratitude

833
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.463
if you and your granddaughter
want anything

834
00:59:56.496 --> 00:59:58.899
that resembles a normal life.

835
00:59:58.932 --> 01:00:00.067
Count me out, Gabriel.

836
01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.436
Oh, no, no, Travis.

837
01:00:02.469 --> 01:00:03.637
There is no out for you.

838
01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:08.408
We are in this to the end.

839
01:00:08.442 --> 01:00:09.643
When does it end?

840
01:00:09.676 --> 01:00:11.878
When I say it does.

841
01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:16.149
No. My end is now. Right now.

842
01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:25.926
Good boy, Little Man. Stay.

843
01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.395
Stay.

844
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:32.366
Stay... Uh-uh! Stay.

845
01:00:33.967 --> 01:00:35.335
Okay, get it.

846
01:00:37.571 --> 01:00:39.106
Hey, Pearl, what's news?

847
01:00:39.139 --> 01:00:41.007
Your story's
getting some play.

848
01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:44.211
What do you mean?
I didn't write it.

849
01:00:44.244 --> 01:00:46.380
Ah, check the site.

850
01:00:56.423 --> 01:01:00.093
Needs a bit of polish, but your
word choices are delightful.

851
01:01:00.127 --> 01:01:01.695
Who knew that "dollop"
could be a verb?

852
01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:03.330
- I know. I was just...
- Go!

853
01:01:03.363 --> 01:01:04.674
- I was just in the middle of...
- Go!

854
01:01:04.698 --> 01:01:07.167
- Mira.
- That was my lead.

855
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.544
You've been comatose
and I didn't want

856
01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:10.504
the story to get
scooped up by another outlet.

857
01:01:10.537 --> 01:01:12.005
That's horseshit.

858
01:01:12.038 --> 01:01:13.683
You sent me home
so you could steal my story.

859
01:01:13.707 --> 01:01:16.109
I did not.

860
01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:18.011
And besides,
you're too close to it.

861
01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:19.146
Too close?

862
01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:20.147
The only thing I'm too close to

863
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.015
is punching you in the face.

864
01:01:22.048 --> 01:01:23.016
Please don't.

865
01:01:23.049 --> 01:01:24.985
Stay away from my story.

866
01:01:26.052 --> 01:01:27.554
Whatever.

867
01:01:27.587 --> 01:01:29.689
There's no real facts.

868
01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:31.491
It's hardly even a story.

869
01:01:34.027 --> 01:01:36.196
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

870
01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.405
What do you mean,
she's not coming over?

871
01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:47.307
I'm making dinner
for her right now.

872
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.260
Do you even
know what today was?

873
01:01:50.745 --> 01:01:52.512
What was today?

874
01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:55.315
Her school play
that you promised you'd come to.

875
01:01:55.348 --> 01:01:56.550
Shit.

876
01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:58.394
I'm not so sure that I
should let her stay with you

877
01:01:58.418 --> 01:02:00.053
when you're not even
responsible enough

878
01:02:00.086 --> 01:02:02.055
to show up for the easy stuff.

879
01:02:02.088 --> 01:02:04.524
I've... I've had a lot of things
on my mind.

880
01:02:04.558 --> 01:02:06.369
But apparently, Natalie
wasn't one of them.

881
01:02:09.095 --> 01:02:11.465
Okay, I... I deserve that.

882
01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:13.166
Yeah. You do.

883
01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:15.770
I'm... I'm coming over.

884
01:02:15.803 --> 01:02:17.738
No.

885
01:02:17.772 --> 01:02:19.473
I want to apologize to her
personally.

886
01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:21.208
No, you and
your paranoia

887
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:23.043
can't get out of your own way.

888
01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:24.220
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

889
01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:25.479
insecure, screwed up kid.

890
01:02:25.512 --> 01:02:27.647
You need to take care
of yourself, dad.

891
01:02:27.681 --> 01:02:29.516
Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

892
01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:36.332
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an...

893
01:02:36.356 --> 01:02:38.334
I'm not having you turn Natalie
into an insecure...

894
01:02:38.358 --> 01:02:39.669
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

895
01:02:39.693 --> 01:02:41.995
insecure, screwed up kid.

896
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.771
Hey, you've reached Mira.

897
01:03:14.795 --> 01:03:16.329
You know what to do.

898
01:03:16.363 --> 01:03:20.433
Hi, Mira, it's me, Drew.
Just leaving the office now.

899
01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:23.603
Just wanted to say I'm a shit
for jumping your story.

900
01:03:25.405 --> 01:03:26.573
Hope you're feeling better.

901
01:03:31.144 --> 01:03:32.145
Um, I've got to go.

902
01:04:05.378 --> 01:04:07.147
You can't be serious.

903
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.183
911,
what's your emergency?

904
01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:45.753
Yeah, I'm being chased
on the I-66.

905
01:04:47.253 --> 01:04:49.255
Oh, come on, really?

906
01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:03.136
Come on!

907
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:44.644
You okay, Drew?

908
01:05:44.678 --> 01:05:47.213
I don't... don't know.

909
01:06:12.605 --> 01:06:14.316
Just wanted to
say I'm a shit

910
01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.276
for jumping your story.

911
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:17.745
Hope you're feeling better.

912
01:06:18.678 --> 01:06:19.780
Ah, I've got to go.

913
01:06:19.814 --> 01:06:22.549
See what I mean?
You can hear it in his voice.

914
01:06:22.582 --> 01:06:25.585
- Something happened.
- Yeah.

915
01:06:25.618 --> 01:06:30.457
No, I hear you and see the dots
you're connecting, and, yes,

916
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:34.494
that conclusion makes a lot of
sense right now, but...

917
01:06:34.527 --> 01:06:36.964
suggesting that the head of the
FBI had Drew killed

918
01:06:36.997 --> 01:06:38.999
because he printed a story?

919
01:06:39.033 --> 01:06:41.601
- Sounds crazy, right?
- Right.

920
01:06:41.634 --> 01:06:42.870
Yeah.

921
01:06:42.903 --> 01:06:47.041
Listen, honey, we're all
heartbroken, okay?

922
01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:49.744
But the reality is, this is
probably just a bad accident,

923
01:06:49.777 --> 01:06:52.713
or road rage or I... I don't know
whatever it might have been.

924
01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:55.615
But honestly, at this point,
sitting here playing detective,

925
01:06:55.648 --> 01:06:58.384
it is not going to
solve anything

926
01:06:58.418 --> 01:07:01.321
including a conspiracy theory.

927
01:07:09.764 --> 01:07:12.565
Operation Unity.
That's what Dusty called it.

928
01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:14.001
That could mean anything.

929
01:07:14.034 --> 01:07:15.635
Dusty said that the FBI was

930
01:07:15.668 --> 01:07:17.872
crossing the line,
killing innocent civilians.

931
01:07:17.905 --> 01:07:19.372
His words.

932
01:07:19.405 --> 01:07:20.751
And that he was coming to me
with his story

933
01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:24.779
because of my articles
about Sofia Flores.

934
01:07:24.812 --> 01:07:25.678
I'm not following.

935
01:07:25.713 --> 01:07:27.547
Sofia Flores was an
innocent civilian

936
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.416
killed in an accidental
hit-and-run, unless...

937
01:07:32.418 --> 01:07:34.420
unless it wasn't an accident.

938
01:07:35.723 --> 01:07:37.657
So you think she was murdered
by the FBI

939
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.860
and that is what crossed
Dusty's line?

940
01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:41.661
Maybe.

941
01:07:41.694 --> 01:07:43.563
If what
you're saying is true,

942
01:07:43.596 --> 01:07:45.632
with the way the world
is right now,

943
01:07:45.665 --> 01:07:48.035
this could wipe out the
FBI's highest ranks.

944
01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:50.503
As it should.

945
01:07:50.537 --> 01:07:53.874
You do realize
if your dots are correct

946
01:07:53.908 --> 01:07:57.912
and we play this wrong,
we could both end up like Sofia.

947
01:07:57.945 --> 01:08:00.513
And Dusty. And maybe Drew.

948
01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.718
Still wanna pursue it?

949
01:08:12.126 --> 01:08:13.660
We're sorry.

950
01:08:13.693 --> 01:08:16.063
The number you have reached
is not in service.

951
01:08:16.096 --> 01:08:17.397
Please check the...

952
01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:22.136
We're sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

953
01:08:22.169 --> 01:08:23.636
Sorry... Not in service...

954
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:25.773
Please check the number
or try again.

955
01:08:25.806 --> 01:08:26.974
The number... Try again.

956
01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.695
I'm sorry, Mr. Block,

957
01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:50.807
but your granddaughter no longer
goes to school here.

958
01:08:50.831 --> 01:08:52.132
Since when?

959
01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:53.700
A few days ago.

960
01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:56.136
Did her mother say
where they were moving?

961
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.838
- No.
- But her school records...

962
01:08:57.872 --> 01:08:59.539
They had to be
forwarded somewhere.

963
01:08:59.572 --> 01:09:00.741
No, no one asked.

964
01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:02.575
I'm not sure what happened.

965
01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:04.912
I mean, usually we're given
plenty of notice...

966
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:08.949
When did Amanda
quit the hospital?

967
01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:11.819
Amanda quit the hospital.
Amanda quit the hospital.

968
01:09:13.653 --> 01:09:15.588
No, no, no, everything's fine.

969
01:09:15.622 --> 01:09:17.523
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

970
01:09:17.557 --> 01:09:18.802
When did you last hear
from Natalie?

971
01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:20.027
Natalie. Natalie.

972
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.461
Natalie. No, no.

973
01:09:21.494 --> 01:09:22.863
Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.

974
01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:24.765
When did my daughter
quit the hospital?

975
01:09:24.798 --> 01:09:27.034
Amanda. Amanda. When did
you last hear from Natalie?

976
01:09:27.067 --> 01:09:28.903
Any idea where they might be?

977
01:09:28.936 --> 01:09:31.537
Any idea
where they might be?

978
01:09:31.571 --> 01:09:33.673
So, no idea where they might be.

979
01:09:35.075 --> 01:09:38.178
If fingers
need to be pointed,

980
01:09:38.212 --> 01:09:40.014
we know where to point them.

981
01:10:25.793 --> 01:10:27.094
Who is it?

982
01:10:27.127 --> 01:10:29.229
- It's me.
- Oh, God!

983
01:10:29.263 --> 01:10:31.832
It's okay, it's just Pearl.

984
01:10:33.267 --> 01:10:35.235
Thought I'd cheer you up.

985
01:10:35.269 --> 01:10:36.602
Dinner?

986
01:10:39.139 --> 01:10:40.707
What am I looking at?

987
01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.210
Dusty Crane's rap sheet
I pulled off the police wire.

988
01:10:43.243 --> 01:10:44.778
And?

989
01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:47.580
Now we know he was an
undercover Federal agent,

990
01:10:47.613 --> 01:10:48.624
so this shouldn't
have been in the.

991
01:10:48.648 --> 01:10:49.984
National Crime's main system.

992
01:10:50.017 --> 01:10:52.552
To protect his identity.

993
01:10:52.585 --> 01:10:54.722
- Which means it's fake.
- It's fake.

994
01:10:54.755 --> 01:10:56.967
The only reason to do that would
be to spread misinformation

995
01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.625
in order to discredit him
as a potential source.

996
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:04.031
So someone like me
doesn't write his story.

997
01:11:04.064 --> 01:11:06.734
Okay, I could buy that.

998
01:11:06.767 --> 01:11:08.035
But who?

999
01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:14.174
- Travis.
- What did you do?

1000
01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:15.708
Senses return?

1001
01:11:15.743 --> 01:11:17.610
You ready to get back
in the saddle?

1002
01:11:17.643 --> 01:11:19.579
Where's my family?

1003
01:11:19.612 --> 01:11:20.714
How the hell would I know?

1004
01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.082
If I find out you had anything

1005
01:11:22.116 --> 01:11:25.319
to do with Amanda and my
granddaughter disappearing,

1006
01:11:25.352 --> 01:11:27.021
you're gonna need more men.

1007
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:32.793
I don't have a clue what
you're going on about.

1008
01:11:33.727 --> 01:11:35.029
Now I know you've got a lot

1009
01:11:35.062 --> 01:11:37.630
swirling around that
skull of yours,

1010
01:11:37.663 --> 01:11:39.967
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

1011
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.871
We always had
each other's back, remember?

1012
01:11:43.904 --> 01:11:47.908
Now, let's go to the office
and talk about saving souls.

1013
01:11:47.941 --> 01:11:52.746
I've told you before.
No. It's over.

1014
01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.314
That's your decision.

1015
01:11:54.348 --> 01:11:57.683
That's the wrong decision,
but yours.

1016
01:11:59.253 --> 01:12:00.788
Excuse me.

1017
01:12:05.691 --> 01:12:08.362
Last chance. Where are they?

1018
01:12:08.395 --> 01:12:10.030
We're the FBI.

1019
01:12:10.064 --> 01:12:13.934
We don't involve ourselves
in petty domestic disputes.

1020
01:12:13.967 --> 01:12:16.770
He touches the car again,
shoot him.

1021
01:12:20.974 --> 01:12:24.812
The great J. Edgar Hoover once
said, in a public forum no less,

1022
01:12:24.845 --> 01:12:27.915
that the purpose of
counter-intelligence action

1023
01:12:27.948 --> 01:12:32.786
is to disrupt and it is
immaterial whether facts exist

1024
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.955
to substantiate the charge.

1025
01:12:37.825 --> 01:12:40.861
If I were to say that in
public today, I can just imagine

1026
01:12:40.894 --> 01:12:44.832
the media backlash that would
wash me out of this office.

1027
01:12:44.865 --> 01:12:46.366
- It wouldn't be pretty, sir.
- No.

1028
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.771
Nowadays, this country is ruled
by gotcha moments on Twitter.

1029
01:12:50.804 --> 01:12:53.173
But that doesn't mean
it's still not the truth.

1030
01:12:53.207 --> 01:12:57.945
Hoover had COINTELPRO,
and I have Operation Unity.

1031
01:12:57.978 --> 01:13:00.981
And as unpopular as
what we do may sound,

1032
01:13:01.014 --> 01:13:04.251
History tells us that
spilling a little blood

1033
01:13:04.284 --> 01:13:08.322
is absolutely necessary
to maintain law and order.

1034
01:13:08.355 --> 01:13:12.960
Now, either Crane didn't
understand that, or didn't care.

1035
01:13:12.993 --> 01:13:16.930
And now look at the mess
he's making me clean up.

1036
01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:21.268
What's worse is, he's infected
someone... dear to me.

1037
01:13:21.301 --> 01:13:22.402
Block.

1038
01:13:22.436 --> 01:13:24.838
Been a good friend, family,

1039
01:13:24.872 --> 01:13:27.007
for as long as I can remember.

1040
01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.776
Sir, I may be
out of line here, but...

1041
01:13:32.112 --> 01:13:34.081
would you like us
to have a word with him?

1042
01:13:35.816 --> 01:13:38.886
Someone in the FBI created
a false criminal record

1043
01:13:38.919 --> 01:13:42.222
for a Federal agent involved in
a secret FBI program.

1044
01:13:42.256 --> 01:13:45.125
That fake record was then sent
out on the police wire

1045
01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:47.761
so that the media
would ignore him.

1046
01:13:47.794 --> 01:13:49.429
Drew obviously didn't.

1047
01:13:49.463 --> 01:13:52.299
And now that agent
and Drew are both dead.

1048
01:13:52.332 --> 01:13:53.834
Interesting.

1049
01:13:55.335 --> 01:13:57.070
Almost.

1050
01:13:57.104 --> 01:13:59.806
We run that, and tomorrow we get
a simple, logical explanation.

1051
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.175
We have no proof to refute it.

1052
01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:03.744
Or corrupt FBI agents
following us home.

1053
01:14:03.777 --> 01:14:05.045
- And then there's that.
- Fine.

1054
01:14:05.078 --> 01:14:06.980
You want more proof,
I'll just call the FBI

1055
01:14:07.014 --> 01:14:08.958
and ask for an interview with
the asshole that killed Dusty.

1056
01:14:08.982 --> 01:14:10.918
Mira, I know this is
frustrating,

1057
01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:12.886
but what we need is
an actual living person

1058
01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.454
who can help tell the story.

1059
01:14:14.488 --> 01:14:17.457
Someone with specifics who can
help fill in the basics.

1060
01:14:17.491 --> 01:14:21.328
The who, the what, the when.
And if we're lucky, the why.

1061
01:14:21.361 --> 01:14:22.896
The why is obvious.

1062
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:25.199
Obvious to you
isn't good enough.

1063
01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:27.935
Listen, if we are dealing
with a corrupt head of the FBI,

1064
01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:29.946
they will cover up the cover up
with another cover up

1065
01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:31.471
and they'll spin it as
some top secret

1066
01:14:31.505 --> 01:14:33.073
national security operation
that hides

1067
01:14:33.106 --> 01:14:35.075
behind the veil of need-to-know.

1068
01:14:35.108 --> 01:14:38.779
The American people
need to know the truth.

1069
01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:40.480
That's what
I used to think.

1070
01:14:40.514 --> 01:14:42.216
And you don't anymore?

1071
01:14:42.249 --> 01:14:45.052
Honestly, undecided.

1072
01:14:45.085 --> 01:14:47.054
Sometimes I think
it's better to live

1073
01:14:47.087 --> 01:14:49.089
in the happiness of the unknown.

1074
01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:52.059
The United States government is

1075
01:14:52.092 --> 01:14:54.261
murdering its own
innocent citizens.

1076
01:14:57.831 --> 01:14:58.966
Yeah.

1077
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.835
That is messed up.

1078
01:15:03.003 --> 01:15:05.405
We need to nail these assholes.

1079
01:15:05.439 --> 01:15:07.107
Nothing? Nothing?

1080
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:09.343
No forwarding address?
No phone records?

1081
01:15:09.376 --> 01:15:10.844
Would you be able to pull

1082
01:15:10.877 --> 01:15:12.980
school enrollment records
for Natalie Block?

1083
01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:14.548
Check the entire country.

1084
01:15:14.581 --> 01:15:16.216
Actually, Sam, one more thing.

1085
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.985
Search all informants
who recently entered.

1086
01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:19.253
Witness Protection.

1087
01:15:19.286 --> 01:15:20.797
They may have changed
their last names,

1088
01:15:20.821 --> 01:15:22.422
but they would have kept
their first.

1089
01:15:22.456 --> 01:15:24.358
Amanda and Natalie.

1090
01:15:24.391 --> 01:15:26.326
Okay. Hey... hey, Sam.

1091
01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.028
Let's keep this between us.

1092
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:30.497
Do this for me,
consider us even.

1093
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:31.531
Thanks, Sam.

1094
01:15:38.438 --> 01:15:40.407
Block.

1095
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.576
Oh, yeah, uh, Mira.

1096
01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:45.779
Listen, uh, now's not
a good time.

1097
01:15:49.049 --> 01:15:50.917
What do you have?

1098
01:15:50.951 --> 01:15:52.419
Robinson's very capable

1099
01:15:52.452 --> 01:15:55.155
when it comes
to cleaning up his messes.

1100
01:15:55.188 --> 01:15:57.924
I would say this has his
fingerprints all over it.

1101
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:01.361
I need a quote
from a reliable source.

1102
01:16:01.395 --> 01:16:03.997
I'm the last person
you want as a source.

1103
01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:05.265
But you know it's wrong.

1104
01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:07.901
I know what I know,
but my hands are dirty.

1105
01:16:07.934 --> 01:16:10.370
You put my name out there,
my credibility,

1106
01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:12.172
it'll come into question.

1107
01:16:12.205 --> 01:16:13.307
Even my sanity.

1108
01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.175
They'll say I made the
whole thing up,

1109
01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:18.445
all in the name of
protecting myself.

1110
01:16:18.478 --> 01:16:21.381
Probably wind up like Dusty.

1111
01:16:21.415 --> 01:16:23.059
I still don't understand
why Robinson

1112
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.951
would go to all these lengths.

1113
01:16:25.986 --> 01:16:29.890
Same reason Hoover did it
for almost 50 years.

1114
01:16:29.923 --> 01:16:32.292
To maintain power, control,

1115
01:16:32.326 --> 01:16:35.395
which will give him a
shelf life that'll outlast

1116
01:16:35.429 --> 01:16:39.166
every politician on Capitol Hill
and in the White House.

1117
01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:41.335
You can't let them
get away with this.

1118
01:16:41.368 --> 01:16:44.338
I mean, this is your chance
to right all your wrongs.

1119
01:16:44.371 --> 01:16:47.040
What's done is done.
There's no going backwards.

1120
01:16:47.074 --> 01:16:49.076
Then let's go forward
and prevent Robinson

1121
01:16:49.109 --> 01:16:51.578
from abusing his power
in the future.

1122
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:53.013
If we don't stand up to him,

1123
01:16:53.046 --> 01:16:54.981
he'll just keep growing
Operation Unity.

1124
01:16:55.982 --> 01:16:57.250
He probably will.

1125
01:16:57.284 --> 01:17:00.954
Remember, it's your job
to protect the agents.

1126
01:17:00.987 --> 01:17:02.498
How many more Dusty's
have to die for you

1127
01:17:02.522 --> 01:17:03.722
to stop looking the other way?

1128
01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:10.464
As long as I've worked
for Robinson,

1129
01:17:10.497 --> 01:17:14.101
I've... I've never heard
of Operation Unity.

1130
01:17:14.134 --> 01:17:15.369
Somebody must know.

1131
01:17:15.402 --> 01:17:17.471
These sort of people
don't talk out of turn.

1132
01:17:17.504 --> 01:17:20.407
Maybe, but secrets
this big can't hide forever.

1133
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:26.246
Robinson has a safe in his house

1134
01:17:26.279 --> 01:17:28.682
where he keeps a
record of everyone

1135
01:17:28.716 --> 01:17:31.151
and everything
the Bureau touches.

1136
01:17:31.184 --> 01:17:33.954
- Everything?
- Everything.

1137
01:17:33.987 --> 01:17:36.390
It's his security blanket,

1138
01:17:36.423 --> 01:17:40.594
ammunition in case anyone
decides to turn against him.

1139
01:17:40.627 --> 01:17:47.033
If there's a paper trail on
Operation Unity, it's in there.

1140
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:47.521
What do you mean,
he blew up your car?

1141
01:19:47.554 --> 01:19:49.794
Block shot it
with a grenade launcher.

1142
01:19:54.829 --> 01:19:56.764
I must never
underestimate that man.

1143
01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:02.269
Where is the crazy
son-of-a-bitch now?

1144
01:20:02.302 --> 01:20:03.637
Don't know.

1145
01:20:04.638 --> 01:20:06.540
Well, I do.

1146
01:20:06.573 --> 01:20:07.674
He's here.

1147
01:20:07.707 --> 01:20:11.278
- Here as in?
- As in, my front door.

1148
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:14.514
If you're not too busy,
you might wanna stop by.

1149
01:20:22.455 --> 01:20:24.190
Wasn't expecting you.

1150
01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:27.160
Got a minute?

1151
01:20:33.366 --> 01:20:36.136
- You sent them. Right.
- I sent who?

1152
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:38.305
You know, if you were
just honest with me,

1153
01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:39.840
I'd have more respect for you.

1154
01:20:39.874 --> 01:20:42.242
I take it this isn't
a friendly pop in.

1155
01:20:42.275 --> 01:20:43.476
What the hell do you want?

1156
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:45.846
All your files
on Operation Unity.

1157
01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.547
I'm afraid that's not happening.

1158
01:20:48.716 --> 01:20:50.483
It's not a request, Gabriel.

1159
01:20:52.185 --> 01:20:53.821
This is a huge mistake.

1160
01:20:53.854 --> 01:20:55.856
I'll add it to my list.
Open it.

1161
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:57.424
Or what?

1162
01:20:57.457 --> 01:20:59.626
Are you really gonna
shoot me, Travis?

1163
01:21:00.627 --> 01:21:02.162
Yes, I will.

1164
01:21:07.902 --> 01:21:09.302
The hard drive.

1165
01:21:09.336 --> 01:21:11.204
I need to see what's on it.

1166
01:21:11.237 --> 01:21:12.706
Load it up.

1167
01:21:20.647 --> 01:21:22.315
Step aside.

1168
01:21:27.487 --> 01:21:30.190
The world isn't ready
to see what's on that drive.

1169
01:21:30.223 --> 01:21:32.392
The truth can be difficult,

1170
01:21:32.425 --> 01:21:34.461
but it's better than
the alternative.

1171
01:21:48.408 --> 01:21:49.944
You two, take the back.

1172
01:23:48.062 --> 01:23:50.765
I recommend you walk away.

1173
01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:53.033
This is not your fight.

1174
01:23:53.067 --> 01:23:55.401
You were just taking orders.

1175
01:24:18.993 --> 01:24:21.028
Robinson's using you.

1176
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:22.830
The way he used me.

1177
01:24:25.065 --> 01:24:27.500
We're just bullets
in his chamber.

1178
01:24:56.462 --> 01:24:57.998
Enough is enough!

1179
01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:37.557
Travis.

1180
01:28:05.285 --> 01:28:07.620
- Who are you?
- Uh...

1181
01:28:07.653 --> 01:28:09.256
This is Pearl.
She works with me.

1182
01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:11.759
Please don't shoot her.

1183
01:28:13.794 --> 01:28:15.661
Can we trust her with this?

1184
01:28:15.695 --> 01:28:17.131
We can.

1185
01:28:22.936 --> 01:28:24.872
Donuts? Really?

1186
01:28:24.905 --> 01:28:26.874
It... it was all I could
find in this dump.

1187
01:28:26.907 --> 01:28:29.043
So, Robinson hid
Amanda and Natalie

1188
01:28:29.076 --> 01:28:31.611
in Witness Protection?

1189
01:28:31.644 --> 01:28:33.613
But no idea where they are?

1190
01:28:34.314 --> 01:28:36.116
Uh-huh, okay.

1191
01:28:36.150 --> 01:28:37.217
Thanks, Sam.

1192
01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:39.552
Yeah. Appreciate you looking.

1193
01:28:46.927 --> 01:28:49.363
Using your family as leverage
against you is so effing wrong.

1194
01:28:49.396 --> 01:28:51.065
Sorry to say.

1195
01:28:51.098 --> 01:28:54.802
Seems relatively minor compared
to everything else he's doing.

1196
01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:58.172
Character assassinations,
political blackmail.

1197
01:28:58.205 --> 01:28:59.807
Looks like flat out murder.

1198
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.976
All under the guise
of protecting democracy.

1199
01:29:03.010 --> 01:29:05.578
What does it say
about Dusty Crane?

1200
01:29:07.881 --> 01:29:09.225
Looks like you've got
everything you'd ever

1201
01:29:09.249 --> 01:29:10.350
want to know about him.

1202
01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:11.952
Oh, there's a video.

1203
01:29:11.985 --> 01:29:13.120
Play it.

1204
01:29:14.254 --> 01:29:16.223
Dustin Crane, Special Agent.

1205
01:29:16.256 --> 01:29:18.358
Your mission?

1206
01:29:18.392 --> 01:29:20.160
You know that.
It's deep infill.

1207
01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:23.397
Have you maintained
contact with the target?

1208
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:26.366
Yes, the target's name
is Sofia Flores.

1209
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.668
How often
is your exposure?

1210
01:29:28.701 --> 01:29:29.870
Every day,
at least

1211
01:29:29.903 --> 01:29:31.704
a few hours a day,
sometimes longer.

1212
01:29:31.738 --> 01:29:33.016
How have you
been able to maintain that

1213
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.210
level of contact with
an unsuspecting target?

1214
01:29:36.243 --> 01:29:39.179
She, uh, she thinks
I'm her boyfriend.

1215
01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:41.849
And?

1216
01:29:41.882 --> 01:29:43.851
Are you her boyfriend?

1217
01:29:45.152 --> 01:29:47.721
I'd like to think so.

1218
01:29:47.754 --> 01:29:49.857
How long has
this been going on?

1219
01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:55.129
A little over a year now.

1220
01:29:55.162 --> 01:29:57.898
And she has
no idea who you really are?

1221
01:29:59.233 --> 01:30:01.835
No, no. No, she doesn't.

1222
01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:08.742
You can see
it in his face.

1223
01:30:08.775 --> 01:30:10.711
They were in love.

1224
01:30:11.745 --> 01:30:13.646
I feel sick.

1225
01:30:39.206 --> 01:30:42.075
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

1226
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:46.146
You knew Dusty Crane was
in love with Sofia Flores.

1227
01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.080
Travis!

1228
01:30:47.114 --> 01:30:49.183
You got nervous he might
come clean to her.

1229
01:30:49.216 --> 01:30:51.151
The thought that someone
with her influence

1230
01:30:51.185 --> 01:30:53.453
might find out what you were
up to scared you.

1231
01:30:53.487 --> 01:30:55.455
You slippery shit.

1232
01:30:55.489 --> 01:30:56.957
Pull the damn car over.

1233
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:59.793
That's why you killed her,
and then him.

1234
01:30:59.826 --> 01:31:01.762
To protect your
secret operation.

1235
01:31:01.795 --> 01:31:03.830
You know nothing.

1236
01:31:08.135 --> 01:31:09.102
Listen carefully.

1237
01:31:09.136 --> 01:31:12.272
Operation Unity is going public.
The whole thing.

1238
01:31:12.306 --> 01:31:14.408
- Bullshit.
- You need to listen.

1239
01:31:14.441 --> 01:31:16.076
Not to you, I don't.

1240
01:31:18.879 --> 01:31:20.781
How about now?

1241
01:31:22.482 --> 01:31:24.484
Our arrangement never happened.

1242
01:31:24.518 --> 01:31:26.086
You're going to destroy my file

1243
01:31:26.119 --> 01:31:28.055
and forget everything
I've done for you.

1244
01:31:28.088 --> 01:31:29.856
After that, you will go public

1245
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:31.491
with the truth
about the operation.

1246
01:31:31.525 --> 01:31:33.293
I am the director of the most

1247
01:31:33.327 --> 01:31:36.463
powerful organization
in the world.

1248
01:31:36.496 --> 01:31:39.333
I will not bargain with you.

1249
01:31:39.366 --> 01:31:41.235
Then call it coercion.

1250
01:31:41.268 --> 01:31:44.304
If I'm not being convincing
enough, there are other ways.

1251
01:32:09.997 --> 01:32:12.866
Fine. We'll do it your way.

1252
01:32:12.899 --> 01:32:14.368
I'll clean your record.

1253
01:32:14.401 --> 01:32:18.105
But there is no chance in hell
I am admitting to anything,

1254
01:32:18.138 --> 01:32:22.342
and if I hear a whisper
of Operation Unity in the press,

1255
01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:25.779
you'll be indicted
before the day is over.

1256
01:32:27.514 --> 01:32:32.019
That was the last threat
you will ever make to me.

1257
01:32:32.052 --> 01:32:34.354
You wanna put a bullet
in your old friend?

1258
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:38.425
Go ahead.

1259
01:32:38.458 --> 01:32:40.927
You'd be doing me a favor.

1260
01:32:41.895 --> 01:32:43.363
Please, do it.

1261
01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:46.466
Do it!

1262
01:32:51.171 --> 01:32:52.172
No.

1263
01:32:52.205 --> 01:32:54.007
You're not getting
off that easy.

1264
01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:55.942
The truth needs to be told.

1265
01:32:55.976 --> 01:32:58.879
And you're gonna be
the one to tell it.

1266
01:32:58.912 --> 01:33:02.816
But first, you tell me.
Where's my family?

1267
01:33:34.648 --> 01:33:36.249
There she is!

1268
01:33:36.283 --> 01:33:37.417
Grandpa!

1269
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:40.220
Hey, come here to me.

1270
01:33:40.253 --> 01:33:42.356
You don't need to worry,
nobody's out there.

1271
01:33:42.389 --> 01:33:44.057
I've already checked.

1272
01:33:44.091 --> 01:33:46.093
Good, and there
probably never will be.

1273
01:33:46.126 --> 01:33:48.161
That's just how
my brain is wired.

1274
01:33:48.195 --> 01:33:49.329
I know.

1275
01:33:49.363 --> 01:33:50.597
I missed you.

1276
01:33:50.630 --> 01:33:52.265
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1277
01:33:52.299 --> 01:33:53.567
Everything okay?

1278
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.378
Just never thought we'd
be in Witness Protection.

1279
01:33:55.402 --> 01:33:57.537
- Sorry about all that.
- It's alright. We're fine.

1280
01:33:57.571 --> 01:34:00.207
I'm just sorry about everything
that you've been through.

1281
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:02.309
- Is everything okay with you?
- Couldn't be better.

1282
01:34:03.076 --> 01:34:05.979
- Anybody wanna go home?
- I do!

1283
01:34:06.012 --> 01:34:07.948
- I do!
- Me, too.

1284
01:34:09.616 --> 01:34:12.386
"Robinson was indicted
after admitting to the existence

1285
01:34:12.419 --> 01:34:14.121
of the morally
reprehensible program

1286
01:34:14.154 --> 01:34:16.390
he dubbed Operation Unity.

1287
01:34:16.423 --> 01:34:19.059
He remains behind bars,
awaiting trial."

1288
01:34:19.092 --> 01:34:20.560
Look at these comments.

1289
01:34:20.594 --> 01:34:22.529
"Explosive."

1290
01:34:22.562 --> 01:34:25.098
"The News Cycle at its finest."

1291
01:34:25.132 --> 01:34:26.242
Don't forget this one.

1292
01:34:26.266 --> 01:34:28.168
"Award-worthy reporting."

1293
01:34:29.136 --> 01:34:30.904
I'm proud of you, Mira.

1294
01:34:36.744 --> 01:34:38.145
I saw it.

1295
01:34:38.178 --> 01:34:40.313
Well, what do you think?

1296
01:34:40.347 --> 01:34:43.718
Very thorough.
I, uh...

1297
01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:48.155
I was surprised you didn't
mention my Vietnam mishap.

1298
01:34:48.188 --> 01:34:49.556
No use for you being on trial

1299
01:34:49.589 --> 01:34:52.125
for something you did
when you were a kid.

1300
01:34:58.465 --> 01:35:00.300
Article's good.

1301
01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:01.468
Thank you.

1302
01:35:01.501 --> 01:35:04.404
For... everything.

1303
01:35:04.438 --> 01:35:06.706
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1304
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:11.545
And I wouldn't have done it
without you, so... thank you.

1305
01:35:12.747 --> 01:35:14.314
You're welcome.

1306
01:35:14.347 --> 01:35:16.316
Take care, Mira.

1307
01:35:16.349 --> 01:35:17.517
You too.

1308
01:35:20.721 --> 01:35:23.323
Ah, a little help, please.

1309
01:35:24.424 --> 01:35:26.960
Run, run, run!
Keep running!

1310
01:35:27.795 --> 01:35:29.629
Go! That's a girl.

1311
01:35:29.663 --> 01:35:31.364
That's it, keep going.

1312
01:35:31.398 --> 01:35:34.568
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's flying! It's flying!

1313
01:35:34.601 --> 01:35:35.635
Atta girl.

1314
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:37.003
You're pretty good at that.

1315
01:35:37.037 --> 01:35:40.307
A bit rusty. Go!

1316
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:42.743
You sure you don't wanna hang
out with us this weekend?

1317
01:35:42.777 --> 01:35:44.311
I'm good.

1318
01:35:45.612 --> 01:35:47.047
I have a date.

1319
01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.182
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we'll see.

1320
01:35:49.216 --> 01:35:51.127
But if you or Natalie need
anything, just let me know.

1321
01:35:51.151 --> 01:35:52.219
Uh-huh. Will do.

1322
01:35:52.252 --> 01:35:53.620
And don't forget to feed her.

1323
01:35:53.653 --> 01:35:55.131
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, get her to school

1324
01:35:55.155 --> 01:35:56.356
on time, Monday morning.

1325
01:35:56.389 --> 01:35:58.726
Food, teeth, school.
Consider it done.

1326
01:35:58.759 --> 01:36:00.260
Anything else?

1327
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:03.363
No shooting guns.

1328
01:36:05.532 --> 01:36:07.133
No guns.

1329
01:36:09.369 --> 01:36:11.171
Where do you stand
on explosives?
