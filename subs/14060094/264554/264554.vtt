{47935}{48007}Don't move, Jedi!|Take him away.
{48474}{48546}Don't be afraid.
{48549}{48597}I'm not afraid to die.
{48713}{48812}I've been dying a little bit each day|since you came back into my life.
{48843}{48904}What are you talking about?
{48940}{48989}I love you.
{49080}{49127}You love me?
{49235}{49313}I thought that we had decided|not to fall in love...
{49354}{49445}that we would be forced|to live a lie...
{49447}{49519}and that it would|destroy our lives.
{49522}{49595}I think our lives are about|to be destroyed anyway.
{49720}{49785}I truly...
{49787}{49846}deeply love you...
{49874}{49936}and before we die,|I want you to know.

{51305}{51370}I was beginning to wonder|if you'd got my message.
{51372}{51444}I retransmitted it just as|you had requested, Master.
{51500}{51546}Then we decided|to come and rescue you.
{51576}{51631}Good job.

{67145}{67215}Now it is finished.
{67251}{67367}Surrender,|and your lives will be spared.
{67369}{67462}We will not be hostages|to be bartered, Dooku!
{67464}{67575}Then, I'm sorry, old friend.
{67868}{67888}Look!

{69479}{69577}[Beeping, Chirping]
{69579}{69676}Oh, I've had|the most peculiar dream.
{69932}{69979}If Dooku escapes...
{69981}{70087}rally more systems|to his cause he will.
{70178}{70231}Hold on!
{70331}{70378}Aim right above|the fuel cells!
{70530}{70602}Good call,|my young Padawan.
{70927}{70982}[Viceroy Gunray]|The Jedi have amassed a huge army.
{70984}{71041}That doesn't seem possible.
{71044}{71106}How could the Jedi|come up with an army so quickly?
{71108}{71187}We must send all available droids|into battle.
{71190}{71235}There are too many.
{71238}{71324}[Speaking In Geonosian]|Our communications have been jammed.
{71501}{71624}-Pilot, land in that assembly area!|-Yes, sir.
{71818}{71936}Sir, I have five special commando units|awaiting your orders, sir.
{71938}{72017}To the forward|command center take me.
{72576}{72643}Attack those Federation starships!|Quickly!
{72906}{72998}Master Yoda,|all forward positions are advancing.
{73000}{73087}Very good.|Very good.
{73780}{73855}[Viceroy Gunray]|This is not looking good at all!
{73857}{73935}We must get the starships|back into space.
{74008}{74103}[Speaking In Geonosian]|We have to order a retreat.
{74105}{74163}My master|will never allow the Republic...
{74165}{74212}to get away|with this treachery.
{74215}{74301}[Speaking In Geonosian]|I'm sending my warriors|to hide in the catacombs.
{74303}{74399}The Jedi must not find|our designs for the ultimate weapon.
{74458}{74585}If they find out what we are planning|to build, we're doomed.
{74615}{74660}[Geonosian]
{74663}{74721}I will take the designs|with me to Coruscant.
{74723}{74809}They will be much safer there|with my master.

{76233}{76278}Yes, sir.
{76280}{76363}Move all quadrants|to sector 5-1-5.
{77324}{77394}Look over there!
{77444}{77501}It's Dooku!|Shoot him down!
{77503}{77549}We're out of rockets, sir.

{78585}{78642}-Lower the ship!|-I can't take Dooku alone!
{78644}{78725}I need you! If we catch him,|we can end this war right now!
{78728}{78801}-We have a job to do!|-I don't care! Put the ship down!
{78803}{78858}You will be expelled|from the Jedi order!
{78860}{78938}-I can't leave her!|-Come to your senses!
{78940}{79028}What do you think Padmé would do|were she in your position?
{79115}{79164}She would do her duty.
{79251}{79299}Hmm.
{79380}{79429}The droid army|is in full retreat.
{79432}{79506}Well done, Commander.|Bring me a ship.
{80153}{80228}[Anakin] You're gonna pay for all|the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.
{80231}{80297}-We'll take him together.|Go in slowly on the left.|-I'm taking him now!
{80300}{80356}No, Anakin! No! No!
{80359}{80440}[Anakin Screams]
{80517}{80601}As you see, my Jedi powers|are far beyond yours.
{80604}{80675}Now... back down.
{80768}{80821}I don't think so.
{81130}{81207}Master Kenobi,|you disappoint me.
{81209}{81283}Yoda holds you|in such high esteem.
{81370}{81425}Surely you can do better.

{81666}{81712}Are you all right?
{81714}{81773}Uh-huh.
{81776}{81863}-We'd better get back to|the forward command center.|-No. No.
{81867}{81951}Gather what troops you can.|We've got to get to that hangar.
{81954}{82029}-Get a transport. Hurry!|-Right away.

{82560}{82630}[Anakin Shouts]
{82632}{82705}Brave of you, boy.
{82707}{82761}But I would have thought|you had learned your lesson.

{84299}{84418}-Master Yoda.|-Count Dooku.

{85251}{85331}Powerful you have become,|Dooku.
{85333}{85406}The dark side I sense in you.
{85409}{85477}I've become more powerful|than any Jedi.
{85508}{85570}Even you.
{85911}{85984}Much to learn you still have.
{85987}{86107}It is obvious that|this contest cannot be decided|by our knowledge of the Force...
{86169}{86231}but by our skills|with a lightsaber.
{86469}{86521}[Yelling]

{91856}{91911}It doesn't feel right.
{91913}{91984}Joined the dark side|Dooku has.
{91987}{92057}Mmm. Lies, deceit...
{92060}{92156}creating mistrust|are his ways now.
{92160}{92263}[Windu] Nevertheless, I feel we|should keep a closer eye on the senate.
{92266}{92314}I agree.
{92341}{92387}Where is your apprentice?
{92389}{92483}On his way to Naboo,|escorting Senator Amidala home.
{92525}{92613}I have to admit that|without the clones,|it would not have been a victor.
{92616}{92665}[Yoda]|Victory?
{92668}{92742}Victor, you say?
