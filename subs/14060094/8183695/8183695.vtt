1
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.454
Listen up, people!

2
00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.819
If fingers need to be pointed,

3
00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:10.856
we know where to point them.

4
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:12.831
They use the recovering economy

5
00:01:12.914 --> 00:01:18.286
and the rising stock market
as their bulletproof vest.

6
00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:19.963
But whose money is it?

7
00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.868
- Is it mine?
- No!

8
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:23.905
- Is it yours?
- No!

9
00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:26.512
- I can't hear you.
- No!

10
00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:31.504
And despite all this wealth
they are hoarding,

11
00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:34.549
they have the gall to accuse us

12
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:38.512
of trying to destroy society
with our policies

13
00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:41.519
that promote equal pay
for women.

14
00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:45.555
Racial equality for all people.

15
00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.718
And health care for everyone.

16
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:52.061
- Well, what do we say?
- Game over!

17
00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:54.534
- Say that again!
- Game over!

18
00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:57.867
- Say like you mean it!
- Game over!

19
00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:01.745
They label us
"domestic terrorists"

20
00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:06.545
when they're the ones
stifling our First Amendment

21
00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:10.941
with ruthless threats
and divisive political warfare.

22
00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:19.950
Financial greed and unbridled
power is all they know.

23
00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:24.456
Well, now, we have
something to say!

24
00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.772
- Say it! Say it!
- Say it!

25
00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:32.098
If the leaders of
the United States Government

26
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:34.899
won't respect its people...

27
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.972
its people
will not respect them!

28
00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.407
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

29
00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:50.882
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

30
00:03:25.514 --> 00:03:27.616
Um, could you...

31
00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:30.788
Never mind.

32
00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:40.461
Ma'am. Sorry about that.

33
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.866
- Hope it won't hurt my rating.
- No...

34
00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:32.884
Come on, you cowards!

35
00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:34.161
- Come on!
- Shut up!

36
00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:37.548
- Everybody, move back!
- Get on out of here!

37
00:05:37.632 --> 00:05:39.629
We want that shitbird spy!

38
00:05:39.713 --> 00:05:41.651
Sir, we can't do that.
Now, please, back up!

39
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.636
Hand the hussy over!

40
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.093
Or we'll feed her and y'all
to T and Rex

41
00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:48.324
one piece at a time.

42
00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:14.999
- You Robinson's special guy?
- I am.

43
00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:17.680
- Thank goodness you're here.
- You called the local sheriff?

44
00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:19.338
Of course not.

45
00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:20.836
Someone must have called it in

46
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.055
when I unloaded my revolver
at the crazies.

47
00:06:24.137 --> 00:06:25.829
I panicked.

48
00:06:33.802 --> 00:06:36.673
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

49
00:06:47.384 --> 00:06:50.091
Based on the fact these crazies
are about to bury you

50
00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.889
in a shallow grave,
something happened.

51
00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:56.838
I've been out here
almost two years

52
00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:59.699
playing the part
with these racist bastards,

53
00:06:59.783 --> 00:07:01.865
and it's getting inside my head.

54
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.182
I got sloppy.

55
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:06.713
They found a few bugs.

56
00:07:06.798 --> 00:07:08.747
Somehow traced it back to me.

57
00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:11.418
Stop it, Special Agent Davidson.

58
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.281
I need you to keep your
wits intact.

59
00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:16.060
I thought it was your job

60
00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:18.021
to get me out of
this kind of situation.

61
00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:21.389
That is correct.
And I'm about to.

62
00:07:21.473 --> 00:07:24.401
Come on, bitch!
Come on out!

63
00:07:24.483 --> 00:07:26.033
You ain't pretty enough
to be this stupid.

64
00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:28.091
You're about to eat
some buckshot.

65
00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:32.062
Back up before someone
gets hurt!

66
00:08:26.516 --> 00:08:28.790
Which one of you wants
an extra hole in your head?

67
00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:31.855
Hey, let's light 'em up,
like a firework!

68
00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:58.225
- Bitch.
- Move!

69
00:08:58.307 --> 00:08:59.883
- Move!
- Let's go!

70
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.860
- Stay back!
- Grab the hoses!

71
00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:20.839
Get in the car.

72
00:09:20.923 --> 00:09:22.339
Stay low.

73
00:09:23.907 --> 00:09:25.908
Come on! Come on!

74
00:09:31.248 --> 00:09:32.283
Subtle.

75
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:40.969
Listen, can we
just cut to it?

76
00:09:41.052 --> 00:09:44.326
Are you officially
asking for my help?

77
00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:46.076
Because if you are,

78
00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:48.230
I think I have a few solutions.

79
00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:53.403
Alright then, I'll handle it.

80
00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:55.272
We'll talk soon.

81
00:09:57.307 --> 00:09:59.355
The President's Chief of Staff
isn't happy

82
00:09:59.437 --> 00:10:03.181
with how local PD are handling
the millennial soapbox crowd.

83
00:10:03.264 --> 00:10:05.825
Didn't realize
the FBI was charged

84
00:10:05.908 --> 00:10:08.123
with crowd control
at the White House.

85
00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:10.028
At least they know who to call

86
00:10:10.114 --> 00:10:12.370
when they want
something done right.

87
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.860
You ask me, all these politicos
are chasing their own shadows.

88
00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:18.363
If they wanna last longer
than one term,

89
00:10:18.447 --> 00:10:20.416
they need to smarten up

90
00:10:20.499 --> 00:10:24.556
and understand what got them
elected in the first place.

91
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.263
Fear.

92
00:10:26.346 --> 00:10:28.210
When the people are afraid
for their jobs

93
00:10:28.293 --> 00:10:30.182
or their wallets,
or their lives,

94
00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:32.951
they want Uncle Sam
to protect them.

95
00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.186
So if these
politically-correct puppets

96
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:38.543
wanna straighten out
ornery protesters,

97
00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:40.115
give 'em fear.

98
00:10:41.652 --> 00:10:43.985
Good thing they have you, Gabe.

99
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.932
If I've learned anything,
this job's all about

100
00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:51.995
finding creative ways
of keeping the peace.

101
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:55.480
So...

102
00:10:55.562 --> 00:10:57.086
Davidson.

103
00:10:57.168 --> 00:10:58.614
She's pretty shaken up.

104
00:10:58.697 --> 00:11:00.245
I dropped her off at a facility.

105
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:02.613
She's... being cleaned up
and debriefed.

106
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.950
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

107
00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:07.951
These deep covers
are like the birds

108
00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:10.355
that keep flying
into these windows.

109
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.392
They wiggle and flop around
a whole lot,

110
00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:15.451
but eventually they come back
to their senses.

111
00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:17.456
Yeah, most of the time.

112
00:11:17.538 --> 00:11:19.254
What a waste.

113
00:11:20.591 --> 00:11:22.067
Lucky we got her out at all.

114
00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.075
Oh, I wouldn't call it luck.

115
00:11:24.158 --> 00:11:27.625
I would call it having an ace
in the hole. You.

116
00:11:27.706 --> 00:11:29.086
As always...

117
00:11:29.168 --> 00:11:31.500
I appreciate you making it
happen, Travis.

118
00:12:49.076 --> 00:12:52.062
- Hey, princess.
- Grandpa!

119
00:12:52.147 --> 00:12:54.551
- Where'd you go?
- I was checking the perimeter.

120
00:12:54.634 --> 00:12:56.591
- All clear?
- All clear.

121
00:12:56.673 --> 00:12:58.355
Let's get some cake.

122
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.326
- Stay at your place?
- I'd like to try a normal life.

123
00:13:08.408 --> 00:13:10.081
Be in town more.

124
00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:11.759
Be more involved in her world.

125
00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:14.061
Retire?

126
00:13:14.144 --> 00:13:16.403
Is Gabe on board with this plan?

127
00:13:19.408 --> 00:13:21.317
Yeah, you haven't even mustered
up the courage to tell him.

128
00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:24.479
It's not that simple.
I'm going to. Soon.

129
00:13:24.562 --> 00:13:26.394
Open it. Open it!

130
00:13:26.479 --> 00:13:29.096
- Is that a purse?
- Wow!

131
00:13:29.177 --> 00:13:32.099
Maybe one or two weekends
a month.

132
00:13:32.182 --> 00:13:34.764
The odd weekday,
if we can make that work.

133
00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:36.437
You're busy enough
at the hospital.

134
00:13:36.522 --> 00:13:39.096
This way, I could help
take a bit of the load off.

135
00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:40.509
And it would be good for her.

136
00:13:40.594 --> 00:13:43.595
- And you know this how?
- She suggested it.

137
00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:45.552
She likes me.

138
00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.341
And she wants a male figure
in her life

139
00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:49.413
on a, you know,
consistent basis.

140
00:13:49.498 --> 00:13:52.471
Dad, is that a dig
at my love life?

141
00:13:52.552 --> 00:13:54.798
Not at all.

142
00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:57.312
Not your fault
that deadbeat ran off.

143
00:13:59.182 --> 00:14:02.225
Maybe she does,
but... I'm just not convinced

144
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:05.221
that she needs one who's
borderline certifiable.

145
00:14:06.724 --> 00:14:08.302
It's not that bad.

146
00:14:08.384 --> 00:14:11.302
- How many exits?
- Exits?

147
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.200
In this building.
How many exits?

148
00:14:13.283 --> 00:14:14.831
What is it? What is it?

149
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.219
She makes rounds...
checking to see

150
00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:26.701
that all the doors in the house
are locked.

151
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.168
Good.

152
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.552
Every hour, on the hour.

153
00:14:30.634 --> 00:14:32.163
Could be hereditary.

154
00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:34.254
Maybe, or she could be
learning it from you.

155
00:14:34.336 --> 00:14:35.769
You know, first it's the locks.

156
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.495
Next it will be the windows,
the gas stove, the electricity,

157
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.523
and before you know it, she's
going to be asking for a Beretta

158
00:14:40.605 --> 00:14:42.172
for her tenth birthday.

159
00:14:42.254 --> 00:14:44.797
That's too young
by a couple of years.

160
00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:46.668
Look, I'm handling it.

161
00:14:46.753 --> 00:14:49.115
It's under control.

162
00:14:49.197 --> 00:14:51.643
And besides,
a little paranoia's healthy.

163
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:54.447
You never know
what nutcases are out there.

164
00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:56.841
I'm just giving her the tools
to protect herself.

165
00:14:56.923 --> 00:14:58.556
That's where you're wrong.

166
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.480
You think that it's all about
protecting her?

167
00:15:00.562 --> 00:15:02.221
In reality, you might be the one

168
00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:04.245
who turns her
into a crazy person.

169
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.118
Three. Or five.

170
00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:12.793
Front entrance.
Fire exit on the right.

171
00:15:12.875 --> 00:15:14.774
Loading dock in the back.

172
00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:18.195
Two more, if you count
the windows in the bathrooms.

173
00:15:20.263 --> 00:15:22.869
Look, I wasn't a
great husband or father

174
00:15:22.951 --> 00:15:25.144
and I can't unwind that.

175
00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:26.615
But if you give me the chance,

176
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.272
I'd like to be the best
grandfather I can be.

177
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.274
This for Natalie, or you?

178
00:15:36.947 --> 00:15:39.855
Thank you, gramps. I love it!

179
00:15:39.937 --> 00:15:41.951
You're welcome, sweetie.

180
00:15:53.965 --> 00:15:56.533
Washington News Cycle.

181
00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:14.802
Pass.

182
00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:17.471
- Pass!
- Drew.

183
00:16:17.556 --> 00:16:20.826
Yeah, Sofia Flores' death
is a tragedy.

184
00:16:20.908 --> 00:16:22.471
No one's arguing that.

185
00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:24.538
But to call out Metro PD
as criminal

186
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.793
for not naming a suspect
or divulging evidence,

187
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:28.413
that's not news.

188
00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:29.980
That's them doing their job.

189
00:16:30.062 --> 00:16:31.682
I've been writing about her
for over a year

190
00:16:31.764 --> 00:16:33.543
because she was the voice
of her generation

191
00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.682
spearheading a movement
for real change,

192
00:16:35.764 --> 00:16:38.618
and in return, was mowed down
in a hit-and-run.

193
00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:40.980
There's no reason to believe
it was anything other than

194
00:16:41.062 --> 00:16:44.283
wrong time, wrong place,
bad luck.

195
00:16:44.365 --> 00:16:45.947
No. No, no, no, no, no!

196
00:16:46.028 --> 00:16:49.274
Oh! God.

197
00:16:49.355 --> 00:16:50.758
That's gonna cost me a few quid.

198
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:52.302
The SUV had no plates.

199
00:16:52.388 --> 00:16:53.923
The rideshare driver
was using a fake name.

200
00:16:54.004 --> 00:16:55.759
That's sketchy.

201
00:16:58.293 --> 00:17:00.605
Okay, so the SUV
was probably new.

202
00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:02.446
And I don't know,
the rideshare guy

203
00:17:02.528 --> 00:17:03.561
was an illegal immigrant
who couldn't use his real name.

204
00:17:03.644 --> 00:17:04.822
Who's to say?

205
00:17:04.907 --> 00:17:06.740
If we don't post something
and make it news,

206
00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:09.273
it'll be like it never happened.

207
00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:10.985
That may be true.

208
00:17:11.067 --> 00:17:12.744
What you wrote isn't.

209
00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:15.971
Look, I appreciate your
enthusiasm for the movement,

210
00:17:16.056 --> 00:17:17.466
I really do.

211
00:17:17.551 --> 00:17:19.980
But news stories
are based on facts.

212
00:17:20.065 --> 00:17:21.697
Find them first

213
00:17:21.782 --> 00:17:23.320
then write your story.

214
00:18:07.131 --> 00:18:09.822
Hey, buddy,
you can't park here.

215
00:18:09.905 --> 00:18:11.682
Okay.

216
00:18:11.769 --> 00:18:13.712
Yeah, yeah...

217
00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:15.605
I... I'll move it.

218
00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:19.784
Gun! Put your hands up!

219
00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:20.727
Look, I can explain.

220
00:18:20.807 --> 00:18:23.750
Show 'em!
Put your hands out the window!

221
00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:25.582
Step out of the vehicle.

222
00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:29.486
Put your hands on your head.

223
00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:33.721
Do not move.

224
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.692
Freeze, asshole!

225
00:19:13.663 --> 00:19:15.611
You keep up
this routine,

226
00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:18.535
there's no way
you're walking out of here.

227
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.009
I'm here to help,
but to do that properly,

228
00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:28.990
I need more information.

229
00:19:29.074 --> 00:19:31.615
What were you planning on doing?

230
00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:40.490
The police found booze, pills
and a handgun in your vehicle.

231
00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:45.115
Were you thinking of putting
a round in your brainpan?

232
00:19:45.199 --> 00:19:46.190
No.

233
00:19:46.274 --> 00:19:47.737
Maybe you had a score to settle.

234
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.071
Were you there to kill someone?

235
00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.815
- No.
- Rob a jewelry store?

236
00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:52.471
Look, I wasn't gonna do anything
with the gun.

237
00:19:52.557 --> 00:19:53.976
I was keeping it in the car.

238
00:19:54.057 --> 00:19:55.150
On the passenger seat?

239
00:19:55.234 --> 00:19:57.067
I wasn't thinking straight,
okay?

240
00:19:57.153 --> 00:19:59.442
Are you now?

241
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.413
Alright, Dusty. My time's up.

242
00:20:08.951 --> 00:20:12.721
You're welcome to stay, or we
can stroll out of here together.

243
00:20:13.958 --> 00:20:16.625
But to do that,
you'll need to level with me.

244
00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:19.961
What were you doing?

245
00:20:25.236 --> 00:20:27.939
I was going to talk
to a reporter.

246
00:20:37.576 --> 00:20:38.932
Sign here for Dusty Crane.

247
00:20:39.017 --> 00:20:42.987
Mike, uh, let's just say
this one was never here, yeah?

248
00:20:47.825 --> 00:20:48.990
Thanks.

249
00:20:53.998 --> 00:20:57.664
- Where to, boss?
- A nice, quiet secure place.

250
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.086
Where I get reprogrammed?

251
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.980
Where you can screw your
priorities back on straight.

252
00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:05.642
And after that they'll assign me
to some small town field office

253
00:21:05.726 --> 00:21:06.823
where they can keep an eye on me

254
00:21:06.903 --> 00:21:08.586
while my soul slowly dies,
right?

255
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.057
Or you work through this
speed bump

256
00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:13.980
in order to salvage what's left
of your promising career.

257
00:21:14.063 --> 00:21:15.635
I like you, Dusty.

258
00:21:15.721 --> 00:21:17.826
I like your passion. I like your
commitment to the job.

259
00:21:17.911 --> 00:21:19.769
But you were on the verge of
making a bad choice.

260
00:21:19.854 --> 00:21:21.692
No, it wasn't a bad choice,
it was the right choice.

261
00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:23.634
Wrong. You took an oath.

262
00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:25.567
You need to honor that.

263
00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:26.740
Listen, work with me

264
00:21:26.826 --> 00:21:27.995
and I'll spin it with Robinson

265
00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.509
as best I can.

266
00:21:29.595 --> 00:21:30.711
Get you back on track.

267
00:21:30.796 --> 00:21:32.105
Oh, you don't get it, Block.

268
00:21:32.188 --> 00:21:33.855
It's gone too far.

269
00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.644
We're crossing lines that should
never be crossed.

270
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.677
Guys like you and me,
we don't decide

271
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.159
where those lines are drawn.

272
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.076
The only thing you need to know
is whose orders you follow.

273
00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:46.721
Your loyalties lie
on the wrong side of the future.

274
00:21:46.807 --> 00:21:48.990
I don't expect everyone
to cope with the mind games

275
00:21:49.073 --> 00:21:51.063
that come with
deep undercover work.

276
00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:52.998
Once you're in it,
it's hard to tell

277
00:21:53.082 --> 00:21:56.065
which way is up, down,
right, wrong.

278
00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:57.701
But you're an intelligent guy

279
00:21:57.788 --> 00:21:59.864
and I do expect you
to cope with it.

280
00:22:01.832 --> 00:22:03.808
You do whatever you gotta do
to me.

281
00:22:03.894 --> 00:22:06.134
I'm not playing
by the Bureau's rules anymore.

282
00:22:06.219 --> 00:22:07.903
We'll see about that.

283
00:22:11.342 --> 00:22:14.644
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

284
00:22:22.951 --> 00:22:25.086
This where my
re-education begins?

285
00:22:27.624 --> 00:22:28.923
Wrist.

286
00:22:38.634 --> 00:22:41.345
- Grandpa!
- Hey, sweetie.

287
00:22:41.428 --> 00:22:44.144
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

288
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.758
I needed that hug.

289
00:22:45.842 --> 00:22:48.653
It's okay.
I know you have to work.

290
00:22:48.736 --> 00:22:52.316
Yeah. Um, you here
all by yourself?

291
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.327
Well, not anymore.

292
00:22:54.413 --> 00:22:55.929
Ready to go?
It's our night.

293
00:22:56.012 --> 00:22:58.663
But when you didn't
answer your phone,

294
00:22:58.747 --> 00:23:02.101
Miss Lewis called mommy
at the hospital.

295
00:23:02.184 --> 00:23:06.019
So now I'm supposed to sit tight
and wait for her.

296
00:23:06.105 --> 00:23:08.086
Oh, I see.

297
00:23:08.173 --> 00:23:11.798
But that doesn't mean
you can't stay here with me.

298
00:23:12.865 --> 00:23:17.007
Uh... it certainly doesn't.

299
00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:25.057
Hey, kid!

300
00:23:25.141 --> 00:23:26.750
Come here.

301
00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:29.105
You a criminal?

302
00:23:29.191 --> 00:23:31.913
If it's... if it's a crime to
speak the truth, buddy,

303
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.221
then, yes, I am.

304
00:23:35.092 --> 00:23:37.094
Uh, hey, no, I wouldn't do that.

305
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.932
I like those buttons, though.
Can I see one of those?

306
00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:45.635
Looks like a fun picnic.

307
00:23:45.721 --> 00:23:46.817
Who are these two?

308
00:23:46.901 --> 00:23:49.084
This is me, and that's mommy.

309
00:23:49.164 --> 00:23:51.948
Of course, which means
that must be me.

310
00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:55.846
No, you silly bean.
That's a stranger.

311
00:24:00.384 --> 00:24:02.717
What, what's a stranger doing?

312
00:24:02.798 --> 00:24:04.365
Watching us.

313
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:05.970
Watching you? Why?

314
00:24:06.054 --> 00:24:07.253
Has someone been watching you?

315
00:24:07.337 --> 00:24:08.701
I don't know.

316
00:24:08.788 --> 00:24:10.759
I need you to know.

317
00:24:15.065 --> 00:24:16.980
I'm sorry, Natalie. It's okay.

318
00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:19.264
It's just very important for you
always to be aware,

319
00:24:19.347 --> 00:24:20.736
like I've taught you.

320
00:24:20.817 --> 00:24:22.153
But I am.

321
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.019
And tell me if anyone

322
00:24:24.105 --> 00:24:26.436
strange comes up to you,
approaches you.

323
00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:28.288
Okay, I will.

324
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.823
Good girl. Thank you.

325
00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:32.082
Are bad guys gonna hurt you?

326
00:24:32.163 --> 00:24:33.831
Hurt me? Nah.

327
00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:35.131
Why would you think that?

328
00:24:35.215 --> 00:24:37.990
Because mommy says
your job is dangerous.

329
00:24:38.076 --> 00:24:41.230
Don't worry.
She exaggerates.

330
00:24:41.314 --> 00:24:42.971
It's not that dangerous.

331
00:24:43.056 --> 00:24:46.897
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
or you.

332
00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:49.028
- Or mommy?
- Or mommy.

333
00:24:50.865 --> 00:24:53.191
Mommy!

334
00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:55.836
Hi, sweetie. Grandpa.

335
00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:11.355
Dusty! Don't do this!

336
00:25:16.894 --> 00:25:18.210
I think you have an admirer.

337
00:25:18.294 --> 00:25:20.294
Does he live in a castle
and have a heart of gold?

338
00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:21.779
He's on line three.

339
00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:23.399
Says your last few articles
on Sofia Flores

340
00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:24.884
were inspirational.

341
00:25:24.968 --> 00:25:26.114
Was Prince Charming
slurring his words?

342
00:25:26.198 --> 00:25:27.745
Claims he can guarantee you
a story

343
00:25:27.828 --> 00:25:30.943
worthy of a dozen
clickbait headlines.

344
00:25:31.028 --> 00:25:33.086
- Just tell me what it is.
- No.

345
00:25:33.172 --> 00:25:35.086
No, it's too dangerous
to do over the phone.

346
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.009
They're listening.
They're always listening.

347
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:41.317
I'm gonna come to you,
we'll find some place quiet

348
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.086
to talk about it.

349
00:25:47.288 --> 00:25:49.490
- When?
- How about five minutes?

350
00:26:14.585 --> 00:26:16.375
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

351
00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:17.788
No!

352
00:26:21.086 --> 00:26:23.093
- Look out!
- Move!

353
00:26:37.605 --> 00:26:38.981
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:26:39.067 --> 00:26:40.870
I'm going to free my conscience!

355
00:26:40.953 --> 00:26:43.009
Watch out!

356
00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:34.121
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Hey!

357
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:35.394
Stop!

358
00:28:00.355 --> 00:28:02.288
No, no, no, no, no!

359
00:28:55.076 --> 00:28:56.423
- Are you Mira?
- Yeah, you are?

360
00:28:56.508 --> 00:28:58.421
Being followed.
Let's go somewhere private.

361
00:28:58.505 --> 00:29:00.990
Wait! What exactly is this
all about?

362
00:29:01.074 --> 00:29:02.395
Look, this is really important.

363
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.211
We're gonna have to do this
another time, okay?

364
00:29:04.298 --> 00:29:05.653
No, wait!

365
00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:40.373
The last person
on the planet

366
00:29:40.457 --> 00:29:43.500
I need talking to the
press is Crane.

367
00:29:43.586 --> 00:29:46.296
He should be
in a secure mental facility.

368
00:29:48.699 --> 00:29:50.615
Natalie's school?

369
00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:53.076
What the hell were you thinking?

370
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.211
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

371
00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:57.644
Bad timing. Poor judgement.

372
00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.355
He say anything to you?

373
00:29:59.438 --> 00:30:02.586
He was having a moral code
moment.

374
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.321
Said we were crossing the line.

375
00:30:04.404 --> 00:30:07.749
Must feel nice to be that naive.

376
00:30:07.832 --> 00:30:09.103
Is that all?

377
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:10.519
Just that he's done following

378
00:30:10.605 --> 00:30:11.769
the Bureau's rules,

379
00:30:11.855 --> 00:30:15.759
and based on his little
truck stunt...

380
00:30:15.845 --> 00:30:17.230
I tend to believe him.

381
00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:19.375
He's a live grenade.

382
00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:21.105
This one makes it
to the front page,

383
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:22.795
I'm gonna catch heat
from every direction.

384
00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:25.557
Stupid thing!

385
00:30:25.642 --> 00:30:29.375
I haven't properly worn one of
these since Margaret passed.

386
00:30:29.459 --> 00:30:32.770
- Yeah, she had a gift.
- That she did.

387
00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:35.230
Bless her soul.

388
00:30:35.317 --> 00:30:39.383
Letting Crane slip through your
fingers, not like you.

389
00:30:41.585 --> 00:30:43.202
Are you alright?

390
00:30:43.288 --> 00:30:45.730
Yeah, I've just been feeling
a bit distracted.

391
00:30:45.814 --> 00:30:48.721
Well, no need to
hold it in with me, buddy.

392
00:30:48.807 --> 00:30:50.509
What's the trouble?

393
00:30:50.594 --> 00:30:53.652
I'm trying to spend more time
with Natalie.

394
00:30:53.736 --> 00:30:55.728
And?

395
00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:59.230
At this point, Amanda doesn't
trust me, for good reason.

396
00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:00.813
I need to change that.

397
00:31:00.896 --> 00:31:03.073
Anything I can do to help?

398
00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.852
Actually, Gabe...

399
00:31:06.935 --> 00:31:08.826
I've been thinking.

400
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:11.115
Maybe it's time I hang it up.

401
00:31:11.198 --> 00:31:14.423
No. No, no, no.

402
00:31:14.508 --> 00:31:15.836
Not an option.

403
00:31:15.922 --> 00:31:18.221
The thing is,
it's been over 20 years

404
00:31:18.306 --> 00:31:19.836
of the unpredictable.

405
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:21.468
Never knowing
when you're gonna call

406
00:31:21.548 --> 00:31:23.865
where you're gonna send me
and for how long.

407
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:26.240
Which has made relationships
difficult.

408
00:31:26.323 --> 00:31:29.432
And now... Natalie needs
stability in her life,

409
00:31:29.518 --> 00:31:31.211
and I want to be that for her.

410
00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:33.861
I appreciate the importance
of family, God knows.

411
00:31:33.944 --> 00:31:35.461
Look at me.

412
00:31:35.544 --> 00:31:40.346
But what you do is crucial,
important work.

413
00:31:40.432 --> 00:31:42.615
Our people
go to dangerous places,

414
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:44.586
physically and mentally.

415
00:31:44.673 --> 00:31:46.326
And when they go astray,

416
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.726
I need you to bring them back

417
00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:52.122
before they grow horns.

418
00:31:53.457 --> 00:31:56.192
Saving good agents' souls.

419
00:31:56.278 --> 00:31:58.362
Whatever it takes.

420
00:32:00.832 --> 00:32:02.480
I'll tell you what.

421
00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:05.677
Once Dusty's in a cell
and I have the key,

422
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.336
we'll work out a way
for you to spend more time

423
00:32:08.422 --> 00:32:10.831
with your granddaughter.

424
00:32:10.914 --> 00:32:12.342
Deal?

425
00:32:15.442 --> 00:32:17.813
Out of curiosity,
I pulled our security footage

426
00:32:17.897 --> 00:32:19.586
from when I met this guy.

427
00:32:19.673 --> 00:32:21.163
Uh, do you have a name?

428
00:32:21.249 --> 00:32:22.528
No, but our security guards
recognized him.

429
00:32:22.612 --> 00:32:24.230
It's the same guy
who was arrested

430
00:32:24.314 --> 00:32:26.393
for fighting the cops
across the street.

431
00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:28.775
Your fighter's your runner?

432
00:32:28.855 --> 00:32:31.287
You've looked better.
Did you sleep at all last night?

433
00:32:31.371 --> 00:32:33.317
Define sleep.

434
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:35.696
You know you can just
record your stupid games

435
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.615
and watch them later.

436
00:32:37.701 --> 00:32:39.476
That's rather like
jumping to the belly ache

437
00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:40.908
after you've overeaten
without actually

438
00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:43.654
enjoying the cake first.

439
00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:47.206
I checked every police station
within 50 miles of here.

440
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.490
No record of his arrest.

441
00:32:50.576 --> 00:32:52.451
This feels like another
Mira special.

442
00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.257
You don't find that strange?

443
00:32:54.337 --> 00:32:55.663
Maybe they just let him go

444
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.524
to avoid another police
brutality charge.

445
00:32:57.607 --> 00:33:00.221
He beat the crap
out of four cops.

446
00:33:03.593 --> 00:33:05.625
Okay. Maybe you're right.

447
00:33:07.832 --> 00:33:09.750
So, what's the headline?

448
00:33:09.835 --> 00:33:13.778
I didn't say I have a draft,
or even an angle. I just...

449
00:33:13.861 --> 00:33:17.544
He contacted me.
He could be a legitimate source.

450
00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:19.605
Or a nutcase
wanting to go viral.

451
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:59.449
So... no bank
or credit card activity?

452
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.288
Okay, what about
under Dusty's alias?

453
00:34:03.374 --> 00:34:05.890
His last known cover was...

454
00:34:05.971 --> 00:34:08.576
Uh-huh. I see.

455
00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:11.451
Well, keep an eye on it,
will ya?

456
00:34:11.537 --> 00:34:12.662
Thanks.

457
00:34:29.009 --> 00:34:32.884
No, you silly bean,
that's a stranger...

458
00:34:38.088 --> 00:34:40.422
Watching us...

459
00:34:44.728 --> 00:34:47.695
- Got him?
- Oh, yeah.

460
00:34:47.777 --> 00:34:48.789
Grandpa!

461
00:34:48.873 --> 00:34:51.572
Hey, pumpkin.
Where have you been?

462
00:34:51.657 --> 00:34:53.518
At the park,
flying my kite.

463
00:34:53.601 --> 00:34:56.344
Oh, that sounds fun.
You get it high up in the air?

464
00:34:56.427 --> 00:34:59.617
Not really.
I couldn't run fast enough.

465
00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:03.387
- But mommy did.
- Oh, good job, mommy.

466
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:05.385
Go inside and wash up
for dinner, please.

467
00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:07.489
Can you stay and eat with us?

468
00:35:07.574 --> 00:35:09.889
We're having homemade pizza.

469
00:35:09.972 --> 00:35:11.856
Oh, I love pizza.

470
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:15.592
Pizza it is.

471
00:35:17.128 --> 00:35:19.737
That was four times.

472
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.746
Four? Are you sure?

473
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:25.402
Oh, go again.
One, two, three.

474
00:35:28.672 --> 00:35:30.688
What are you doing?

475
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:33.074
Ah, installing security cameras.

476
00:35:33.157 --> 00:35:34.697
On my house?

477
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.757
For Natalie's safety.
And yours.

478
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.559
I know that I should just say
thank you,

479
00:35:38.641 --> 00:35:41.521
and... some might consider that
very sweet of you,

480
00:35:41.603 --> 00:35:43.092
but you can't do
things like this

481
00:35:43.177 --> 00:35:44.697
without asking my permission.

482
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.362
I was concerned
you would say no.

483
00:35:46.445 --> 00:35:47.773
And you'd probably be right.

484
00:35:47.856 --> 00:35:49.902
She's drawing pictures
of strangers, watching her.

485
00:35:49.985 --> 00:35:53.467
And what do you think is
feeding her growing paranoia?

486
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.844
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

487
00:35:56.927 --> 00:36:00.846
And I admit it. I screwed up
on multiple occasions.

488
00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:02.844
But you've got to know,
I'm trying to fix things.

489
00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:05.809
Natalie doesn't need a fixer
like you.

490
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.018
You sound just like your mother.

491
00:36:10.103 --> 00:36:12.481
Before or after she left us?

492
00:36:18.088 --> 00:36:19.498
I'm worried about you, dad.

493
00:36:19.581 --> 00:36:21.027
There's nothing to worry about.

494
00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:22.536
That's why I'm worried.

495
00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:23.840
Because maybe you can't see it,

496
00:36:23.922 --> 00:36:27.135
but you're not the same dad
that I remember.

497
00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:28.436
You know,
when I was Natalie's age,

498
00:36:28.521 --> 00:36:29.782
your quirks were cute.

499
00:36:29.864 --> 00:36:32.012
Getting my bicycle serviced
every few months.

500
00:36:32.097 --> 00:36:34.603
Waking up at 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
to make sure all the doors

501
00:36:34.688 --> 00:36:36.021
and windows were still locked,

502
00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:39.146
and getting background checks
on my friends' parents.

503
00:36:39.228 --> 00:36:41.625
Your quirks
aren't quirks anymore.

504
00:36:41.708 --> 00:36:45.811
You need to accept that
and you need to deal with it.

505
00:36:45.896 --> 00:36:47.496
I sometimes wonder

506
00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:49.592
did the disorder change you

507
00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:51.856
or was it your dirty job?

508
00:36:55.556 --> 00:36:57.878
Finish with the cameras.

509
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.797
So please don't do anything else
without asking first.

510
00:37:14.643 --> 00:37:16.481
Can I get
either of you gentlemen

511
00:37:16.563 --> 00:37:17.981
something to drink?

512
00:37:19.516 --> 00:37:21.617
No thank you, ma'am.

513
00:37:27.056 --> 00:37:29.034
Special Agent Lockhart.

514
00:37:29.117 --> 00:37:30.699
Special Agent Wallace.

515
00:37:30.782 --> 00:37:32.195
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

516
00:37:32.277 --> 00:37:33.998
Come in.

517
00:37:59.621 --> 00:38:01.074
Don't let baggy pants
get to you.

518
00:38:01.157 --> 00:38:04.492
I just can't believe Sarah falls
for his blatant ass-kissing.

519
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:06.137
She's too smart for that.

520
00:38:06.222 --> 00:38:08.775
My take is, she enjoys it.

521
00:38:08.858 --> 00:38:10.878
Found this on the police wire.

522
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.871
- Is that your guy?
- I think it is.

523
00:38:17.706 --> 00:38:21.250
Not exactly a dream date.
But he is kinda hot.

524
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:22.989
Wanted by
the DC Police Department.

525
00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:25.893
Considered armed
and mentally unstable.

526
00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:28.690
Hm, I wonder if I should be
curious or scared

527
00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:30.018
about what he wanted to tell me.

528
00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:32.056
Probably both.

529
00:38:34.657 --> 00:38:36.525
"Possession."

530
00:38:38.295 --> 00:38:41.110
"Disturbing the peace.

531
00:38:41.193 --> 00:38:43.099
Assault with a deadly weapon."

532
00:38:57.782 --> 00:38:59.614
Mira Jones?

533
00:39:01.018 --> 00:39:01.844
Maybe.

534
00:39:01.927 --> 00:39:04.789
I have information
about your story.

535
00:39:04.873 --> 00:39:06.956
The one that ran away.

536
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:15.606
- You have a name, Agent?
- I'm not an agent.

537
00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.168
This isn't an interview.
Please, turn it off.

538
00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:22.621
- Who is he?
- You tell me.

539
00:39:22.704 --> 00:39:26.175
- Why were you meeting him?
- Why did you chase him away?

540
00:39:26.259 --> 00:39:28.577
Has he contacted you again?

541
00:39:30.947 --> 00:39:32.239
Listen.

542
00:39:32.322 --> 00:39:34.356
He's wanted on multiple counts.

543
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:35.998
If you know where he is,

544
00:39:36.081 --> 00:39:37.934
you're an accessory
after the fact.

545
00:39:38.018 --> 00:39:40.931
Oh, well, thank you for
stopping by and informing me.

546
00:39:41.014 --> 00:39:44.936
I think Little Man's finished,
Mr. Not-An-Agent.

547
00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:48.074
The man needs professional help.
He's unbalanced.

548
00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:51.869
Yeah, I read all about
our friend Dusty's problems.

549
00:39:53.003 --> 00:39:54.338
Guess you don't
have a subscription

550
00:39:54.422 --> 00:39:56.016
to the police wire.

551
00:39:56.101 --> 00:39:57.672
He's on the police wire?

552
00:39:57.757 --> 00:39:59.322
Are we done?

553
00:39:59.405 --> 00:40:01.693
I think we're done.

554
00:40:01.777 --> 00:40:03.820
I don't know
what his intentions were

555
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:06.085
or why he made contact with you.

556
00:40:06.168 --> 00:40:07.971
But let me be clear.

557
00:40:08.054 --> 00:40:10.992
He's not a source for you to
make your fledgling career on.

558
00:40:11.074 --> 00:40:13.867
- Let it go.
- Okay, this is intimidation.

559
00:40:13.952 --> 00:40:17.099
And you know nothing about me
or my fledgling career.

560
00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:20.164
Name "James Van Dorn"
mean anything to you?

561
00:40:22.166 --> 00:40:24.396
No.

562
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:27.972
Mr. Van Dorn and his wife lived
in a comfortable six-bedroom

563
00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:31.085
brownstone across
from Montrose Park.

564
00:40:31.168 --> 00:40:33.380
Plenty of room for them
and their three kids.

565
00:40:33.463 --> 00:40:35.123
But that wasn't enough for him.

566
00:40:35.206 --> 00:40:37.326
He also had a thing
for his secretary.

567
00:40:37.409 --> 00:40:41.219
He made a mistake, had a
daughter, whom he disowned.

568
00:40:41.302 --> 00:40:45.293
She's... probably about 30 now.

569
00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.704
A struggling journalist

570
00:40:46.788 --> 00:40:48.996
who lives in a
shoebox-sized apartment

571
00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.878
and writes under a pseudonym

572
00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:54.760
because her father demanded
she spare him the embarrassment.

573
00:40:54.842 --> 00:40:56.014
Get out of my way.

574
00:40:56.097 --> 00:40:58.913
Quoting a source who isn't sane

575
00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:02.851
could get you sued
for libel or fired.

576
00:41:02.934 --> 00:41:06.242
Although, in this case,
I'd say both are probable.

577
00:41:06.324 --> 00:41:07.452
There's no story here.

578
00:41:07.536 --> 00:41:09.213
- Says who?
- Says me.

579
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.893
Okay.

580
00:41:12.978 --> 00:41:14.083
Thanks.

581
00:41:15.452 --> 00:41:18.155
For confirming that
there is a story. Goodnight.

582
00:41:19.922 --> 00:41:24.103
He contacts you, you contact me.
Got it?

583
00:41:24.186 --> 00:41:28.454
Take my word for it.
Don't play news hero.

584
00:41:28.539 --> 00:41:30.099
Don't.

585
00:41:57.494 --> 00:42:00.059
Dusty, we don't want trouble.

586
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:00.985
Too late.

587
00:42:01.068 --> 00:42:02.483
Robinson just wants to talk.

588
00:42:02.565 --> 00:42:06.360
Let us take you to him. You two
can work out your differences.

589
00:42:06.443 --> 00:42:07.471
Good plan.

590
00:43:07.864 --> 00:43:10.974
The FBI shows up at my
door and tries to intimidate me

591
00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:15.009
because this mentally unstable
guy contacted me?

592
00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:16.842
Maybe he's not
so crazy after all.

593
00:43:16.925 --> 00:43:18.208
You sure he's a Fed?

594
00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:22.146
The whole thing smells
a tad unusual.

595
00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:25.277
Do you... do you want me
to check it out?

596
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.414
No, I got it.

597
00:43:27.498 --> 00:43:29.280
Okay.

598
00:43:29.364 --> 00:43:31.590
But you might want to start
adding some actual detail

599
00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:33.030
because right now,
the only story

600
00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:35.369
you're writing is in your head.

601
00:43:35.452 --> 00:43:38.161
Are you implying that
I'm the crazy one?

602
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:43.047
No. You're the eager one.

603
00:43:43.132 --> 00:43:45.909
Listen, if there is a story
to be found here,

604
00:43:45.992 --> 00:43:47.318
you'll need to take note
of the obvious

605
00:43:47.402 --> 00:43:50.409
and then scrutinize what the
obvious obscures

606
00:43:50.492 --> 00:43:52.021
like an ultra-violet light

607
00:43:52.106 --> 00:43:55.054
illuminating what the
naked eye can't see.

608
00:43:55.137 --> 00:44:00.081
But if you do find something,
tread lightly.

609
00:44:00.164 --> 00:44:01.356
You've got a call.

610
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.068
Just a minute.

611
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.621
It's your secret admirer.

612
00:44:07.523 --> 00:44:08.858
This is Mira.

613
00:45:06.047 --> 00:45:09.021
Government,
even in its best state,

614
00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:12.538
is but a necessary evil.

615
00:45:12.621 --> 00:45:17.101
In its worst state,
it's an intolerable evil.

616
00:45:17.184 --> 00:45:19.170
Now you might think
these words were said

617
00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:22.376
last night on a podcast
or a news program

618
00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.342
about today's state of
the world, but you'd be wrong.

619
00:45:26.427 --> 00:45:31.474
Those words were written by
Thomas Paine in 1776.

620
00:45:53.496 --> 00:45:55.659
Move! Go, go, go!

621
00:45:55.742 --> 00:45:57.434
Hey!

622
00:46:12.784 --> 00:46:14.168
We got him.

623
00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:16.063
Sir, you need to slow down.

624
00:46:16.146 --> 00:46:17.487
I promise you,
this is a bad idea.

625
00:46:54.324 --> 00:46:55.525
Enough, Dusty!

626
00:47:06.302 --> 00:47:09.050
- Time to come in.
- Just like that?

627
00:47:09.132 --> 00:47:10.487
After you sent those two
shitheads to kill me?

628
00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:13.476
What? I didn't send anyone
to do anything to you.

629
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:19.516
What shitheads?

630
00:47:20.684 --> 00:47:22.552
You can't bullshit me!

631
00:47:44.172 --> 00:47:45.822
You're slipping.

632
00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:47.815
You're losing your edge.

633
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:50.099
It's not too late.

634
00:47:50.184 --> 00:47:52.579
I can help you come back with
dignity. Get your life back.

635
00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:54.393
I'm done with that life.

636
00:47:54.476 --> 00:47:56.166
You can't run far enough.

637
00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.295
They'll find you,
cut you off at the knees.

638
00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:00.764
Whatever you're
telling this journalist,

639
00:48:00.847 --> 00:48:02.239
they'll call it treason.

640
00:48:02.324 --> 00:48:04.297
- That's 30 to life.
- I can live with that.

641
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:07.411
No. You're not
thinking straight.

642
00:48:07.494 --> 00:48:10.302
It was all part of the job.
You just got in too deep.

643
00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:11.612
Well, deep enough
to see the truth.

644
00:48:11.695 --> 00:48:13.280
We're killing
innocent civilians.

645
00:48:13.364 --> 00:48:15.440
People that are
trying to make a difference!

646
00:48:15.523 --> 00:48:17.681
- Who's we?
- The Bureau.

647
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.777
And you know this how?

648
00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:25.315
Because I was one of the agents
ordered to do the killing.

649
00:48:26.751 --> 00:48:30.119
Innocent civilians?
Under whose orders?

650
00:48:31.655 --> 00:48:33.342
Robinson's.

651
00:48:33.425 --> 00:48:35.492
That's a serious accusation.

652
00:48:38.195 --> 00:48:39.342
I'm going to prove it.

653
00:48:39.425 --> 00:48:41.460
Listen, I wanna hear
all about it.

654
00:48:41.545 --> 00:48:43.199
Dusty. Dusty!

655
00:49:25.777 --> 00:49:27.677
What just happened?

656
00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:31.784
Do you know who those men were?

657
00:49:31.867 --> 00:49:33.797
No, do... do you?

658
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.927
What did Dusty say to you?

659
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:37.702
Uh, he... he was bringing...

660
00:49:37.784 --> 00:49:40.456
Bringing you what?
What was he bringing you?

661
00:49:41.458 --> 00:49:43.541
This is all my fault.

662
00:49:43.625 --> 00:49:46.764
Mira, look at me.
Tell me what it was.

663
00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:49.784
Documents.

664
00:49:49.867 --> 00:49:50.900
What kind of documents?

665
00:49:50.983 --> 00:49:52.469
His orders.

666
00:49:54.005 --> 00:49:55.472
Proof.

667
00:50:38.547 --> 00:50:40.382
Something on your mind?

668
00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:45.427
It's a sad day, no doubt.

669
00:50:45.512 --> 00:50:47.039
Well, let's be honest.

670
00:50:47.123 --> 00:50:49.469
The kid had a few
too many loose screws.

671
00:50:49.552 --> 00:50:52.362
Or he had a bright future,
until something...

672
00:50:54.065 --> 00:50:57.367
or someone pushed him too far.

673
00:50:59.702 --> 00:51:01.713
Still don't know
who those two men were?

674
00:51:01.797 --> 00:51:05.342
No. At this point,
we still don't know.

675
00:51:06.643 --> 00:51:09.056
He was one of the good guys.

676
00:51:09.139 --> 00:51:10.893
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

677
00:51:10.976 --> 00:51:15.052
Well, unfortunately for him,
you got distracted.

678
00:51:15.135 --> 00:51:17.068
If you'd done your job,

679
00:51:17.152 --> 00:51:19.289
we wouldn't be wearing
these suits today.

680
00:51:20.456 --> 00:51:22.739
It's tragic,
but now it's finished.

681
00:51:22.822 --> 00:51:25.527
Let's point our focus back
where it needs to be.

682
00:51:26.831 --> 00:51:28.833
Plenty more souls to save.

683
00:51:30.768 --> 00:51:32.335
Yeah.

684
00:51:47.717 --> 00:51:49.922
What are you watching, grandpa?

685
00:51:50.007 --> 00:51:52.503
Oh, nothing, sweetie.

686
00:51:52.585 --> 00:51:55.655
Hey, you and Lambie
should be in bed.

687
00:51:55.739 --> 00:51:57.905
I can't sleep.

688
00:51:57.989 --> 00:52:00.329
Uh-huh? Come here.

689
00:52:01.965 --> 00:52:03.121
Attagirl.

690
00:52:03.204 --> 00:52:05.402
Thinking about your big play?

691
00:52:05.485 --> 00:52:06.684
Everything okay?

692
00:52:06.768 --> 00:52:09.581
I think I'm worried about you.

693
00:52:09.664 --> 00:52:12.650
Me? You sound like your mother.

694
00:52:12.733 --> 00:52:14.411
There's nothing to worry about.

695
00:52:17.914 --> 00:52:20.106
Well...

696
00:52:20.188 --> 00:52:23.603
You know...
some people live

697
00:52:23.686 --> 00:52:26.724
their entire lives thinking
they're doing the right thing...

698
00:52:28.025 --> 00:52:32.963
even if it means doing
whatever is proper...

699
00:52:34.463 --> 00:52:36.811
to make sure the good guys
always win.

700
00:52:36.893 --> 00:52:42.715
But then, one day
you wake up and realize...

701
00:52:42.797 --> 00:52:45.742
you're not sure who the
good guys are anymore.

702
00:52:46.744 --> 00:52:48.713
Which makes you wonder...

703
00:52:50.646 --> 00:52:52.717
have I been doing
the right thing?

704
00:52:53.784 --> 00:52:54.885
Am I a good guy?

705
00:52:55.987 --> 00:52:57.454
Grandpa?

706
00:52:58.188 --> 00:53:00.456
Are you a good guy?

707
00:53:04.862 --> 00:53:06.596
I wanna be.

708
00:53:27.918 --> 00:53:30.552
You're not doing anywhere
worthwhile here.

709
00:53:31.755 --> 00:53:33.175
Go home.

710
00:53:33.259 --> 00:53:34.958
Take a couple of days.

711
00:53:36.092 --> 00:53:37.527
Mira.

712
00:53:39.864 --> 00:53:41.664
Home. Go.

713
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.806
- Mira.
- Oh, hey.

714
00:53:51.275 --> 00:53:52.898
Are... are you following me?

715
00:53:52.983 --> 00:53:54.072
No.

716
00:53:54.155 --> 00:53:56.516
But I did wanna come see you.

717
00:53:56.599 --> 00:53:58.447
How're you holding up?

718
00:53:59.681 --> 00:54:01.786
- Not so good.
- Yeah.

719
00:54:03.552 --> 00:54:05.856
You, uh, you like whiskey?

720
00:54:08.159 --> 00:54:10.521
This everything Dusty told you?

721
00:54:10.605 --> 00:54:11.862
That's it.

722
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:15.672
What's this "Operation U?"

723
00:54:15.755 --> 00:54:17.545
Unity. Operation Unity.

724
00:54:17.628 --> 00:54:19.936
Did he say what its mission is?

725
00:54:28.112 --> 00:54:29.847
These are picked up.

726
00:54:32.614 --> 00:54:34.077
Are you being followed?

727
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:35.684
Maybe.

728
00:54:38.755 --> 00:54:42.563
Long story short, he was a
deep cover agent in Miami.

729
00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:45.804
Got sniffy with the cocaine
he was tracking.

730
00:54:45.887 --> 00:54:48.202
When I found him, he was
in the Everglades,

731
00:54:48.286 --> 00:54:50.900
wrestling an alligator
for sport.

732
00:54:52.268 --> 00:54:53.579
Interesting friend.

733
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:55.581
Not a friend. Debtor.

734
00:54:55.664 --> 00:54:57.875
- For?
- Saving his life.

735
00:54:59.641 --> 00:55:01.643
How long you been doing that?

736
00:55:02.813 --> 00:55:05.547
Oh, probably too long.

737
00:55:15.826 --> 00:55:17.543
What's with the three thing?

738
00:55:17.626 --> 00:55:22.733
I have thoughts looping inside
my head, repeating themselves.

739
00:55:22.815 --> 00:55:24.710
If I do something three times,

740
00:55:24.795 --> 00:55:27.106
I can usually
suppress the thought.

741
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.690
Obsessive compulsive.

742
00:55:28.773 --> 00:55:33.570
Sometimes the obsessing makes me
better at what I do.

743
00:55:33.652 --> 00:55:36.034
Other times...

744
00:55:36.117 --> 00:55:39.083
Other times, I feel like I
should be locked away.

745
00:55:42.219 --> 00:55:43.820
What happened to you?

746
00:55:47.358 --> 00:55:50.659
I... screwed up.

747
00:55:51.728 --> 00:55:55.565
I served one tour in Vietnam.
I wasn't even 20.

748
00:55:56.233 --> 00:55:59.623
April 1975.

749
00:55:59.706 --> 00:56:00.813
It was the night before
we pulled out

750
00:56:00.896 --> 00:56:02.704
all our troops and went home.

751
00:56:04.306 --> 00:56:06.577
I was on patrol duty
with Robinson...

752
00:56:06.659 --> 00:56:07.889
Director of the FBI?

753
00:56:07.972 --> 00:56:10.931
The younger version, yes.

754
00:56:11.016 --> 00:56:14.652
We were talking about everything
we would do when we got home.

755
00:56:14.737 --> 00:56:16.657
Then we turned a corner
into a dark alley,

756
00:56:16.742 --> 00:56:20.324
and there was this man
about to...

757
00:56:20.407 --> 00:56:22.909
rape a local woman.

758
00:56:22.992 --> 00:56:24.902
It was hard to see,
but it was obvious

759
00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:27.097
he was roughing her up
pretty bad.

760
00:56:28.697 --> 00:56:30.806
I called out,
and he turned towards us

761
00:56:30.889 --> 00:56:32.869
with what I thought was a gun.

762
00:56:33.838 --> 00:56:36.873
So... I shot him.

763
00:56:38.007 --> 00:56:39.143
Kill him?

764
00:56:40.277 --> 00:56:41.833
Yeah.

765
00:56:41.916 --> 00:56:43.788
Then what happened?

766
00:56:43.871 --> 00:56:45.331
The woman ran off.

767
00:56:45.414 --> 00:56:47.027
Robinson and I
went up to the guy.

768
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:50.152
He was face down in a
puddle of his own blood.

769
00:56:51.422 --> 00:56:54.130
The gun was a bottle of whiskey.

770
00:56:54.213 --> 00:56:56.159
Robinson flipped him over.

771
00:56:59.027 --> 00:57:01.871
He was our Commanding Officer.

772
00:57:01.956 --> 00:57:04.215
I panicked.
Robinson didn't.

773
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.668
I can still hear his voice
like it was that night.

774
00:57:06.751 --> 00:57:08.637
"Walk away. Walk away."

775
00:57:10.039 --> 00:57:11.697
So I did.

776
00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:14.822
Robinson joined the FBI,
we lost touch.

777
00:57:14.905 --> 00:57:18.748
Then about 15 years went by,
and the phone rang.

778
00:57:18.831 --> 00:57:20.335
He'd just been promoted.

779
00:57:20.418 --> 00:57:25.126
Asked if I would work directly
for him, off the books.

780
00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.862
Said it was his job
to protect the Bureau

781
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:29.867
and mine to protect its agents.

782
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:31.239
Off the books, that gives him

783
00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:33.273
plausible deniability for
anything you did.

784
00:57:33.356 --> 00:57:38.976
In hindsight, I suspect
I made a poor career choice.

785
00:57:39.061 --> 00:57:41.213
When you take orders for a
living, trying to support

786
00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:45.847
a family, you learn not to
question those orders...

787
00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:47.855
regardless of the
moral implications

788
00:57:47.938 --> 00:57:51.815
or how they may affect
other people's lives.

789
00:57:54.083 --> 00:57:56.260
So, other than
intimidating journalists,

790
00:57:56.344 --> 00:57:58.161
what other kind of
bad stuff do you do?

791
00:57:58.244 --> 00:58:01.148
You name it,
I've probably done it.

792
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:02.952
Like?

793
00:58:03.034 --> 00:58:05.001
Breaking and entering,
extortion.

794
00:58:05.085 --> 00:58:07.891
Occasional physical coercion.

795
00:58:07.974 --> 00:58:09.786
Murder?

796
00:58:09.869 --> 00:58:13.070
That's not on my menu.

797
00:58:16.373 --> 00:58:20.317
And for the record, I changed
my name not for my father

798
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.753
and his family, but out
of respect for my mother.

799
00:58:23.835 --> 00:58:25.485
He fired her three months
after I was born.

800
00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.027
She raised me all on her own

801
00:58:27.112 --> 00:58:30.197
and never once asked him
for anything.

802
00:58:30.282 --> 00:58:33.119
When I was old enough,
I changed my name to hers.

803
00:58:33.202 --> 00:58:35.226
I stand corrected.

804
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.496
So, Mr. Block... what now?

805
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:54.284
Where did you come from?

806
00:58:54.369 --> 00:58:56.358
What's Operation Unity?

807
00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:59.094
It's nothing that concerns you.

808
00:58:59.177 --> 00:59:01.791
You know, I've always
respected my position

809
00:59:01.876 --> 00:59:06.068
in our arrangement...
but in this case,

810
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:09.092
I prefer to be the one
who decides what concerns me.

811
00:59:10.293 --> 00:59:12.806
Unity. The truth, Gabe.

812
00:59:12.889 --> 00:59:14.965
It's not your place to know.

813
00:59:15.864 --> 00:59:18.125
Or even ask.

814
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:21.213
So Dusty was right. You are
killing innocent people.

815
00:59:21.297 --> 00:59:24.846
You're running your own
secret program, Operation Unity.

816
00:59:24.929 --> 00:59:27.777
And when Dusty tried to go
public with it...

817
00:59:29.246 --> 00:59:30.780
you had him killed.

818
00:59:35.452 --> 00:59:37.054
Oh, please.

819
00:59:38.389 --> 00:59:41.190
We are not having this
conversation.

820
00:59:41.273 --> 00:59:42.907
Oh, yes, we are.

821
00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:44.206
You need to come clean, Gabe.

822
00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:47.137
You're confused about
our relationship.

823
00:59:47.219 --> 00:59:50.878
You work for me.
You are my weapon.

824
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.936
After all these years,
that's all I am to you?

825
00:59:54.538 --> 00:59:55.896
Jesus.

826
00:59:55.981 --> 00:59:58.518
Oh, you have a
short memory, Travis.

827
00:59:58.603 --> 01:00:02.884
It was me who plucked you
from your aimless life

828
01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:05.293
and turned you
into something special.

829
01:00:05.376 --> 01:00:08.021
But don't forget, I also have a
detailed record

830
01:00:08.105 --> 01:00:10.393
of every law you've ever broken.

831
01:00:10.478 --> 01:00:13.070
Everything I did was for you!

832
01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:16.400
I would suggest you show me
a little gratitude

833
01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:19.431
if you and your granddaughter
want anything

834
01:00:19.516 --> 01:00:21.869
that resembles a normal life.

835
01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:23.039
Count me out, Gabriel.

836
01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:25.413
Oh, no, no, Travis.

837
01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:26.637
There is no out for you.

838
01:00:29.106 --> 01:00:31.378
We are in this to the end.

839
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:32.619
When does it end?

840
01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:34.858
When I say it does.

841
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:39.148
No. My end is now. Right now.

842
01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:48.925
Good boy, Little Man. Stay.

843
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.393
Stay.

844
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.364
Stay... Uh-uh! Stay.

845
01:00:56.967 --> 01:00:58.335
Okay, get it.

846
01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:02.083
Hey, Pearl, what's news?

847
01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:04.007
Your story's
getting some play.

848
01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:07.177
What do you mean?
I didn't write it.

849
01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.380
Ah, check the site.

850
01:01:19.422 --> 01:01:23.063
Needs a bit of polish, but your
word choices are delightful.

851
01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.666
Who knew that "dollop"
could be a verb?

852
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.306
- I know. I was just...
- Go!

853
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.639
- I was just in the middle of...
- Go!

854
01:01:27.722 --> 01:01:30.143
- Mira.
- That was my lead.

855
01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.516
You've been comatose
and I didn't want

856
01:01:31.599 --> 01:01:33.467
the story to get
scooped up by another outlet.

857
01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.989
That's horseshit.

858
01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:36.635
You sent me home
so you could steal my story.

859
01:01:36.717 --> 01:01:39.097
I did not.

860
01:01:39.181 --> 01:01:40.972
And besides,
you're too close to it.

861
01:01:41.054 --> 01:01:42.132
Too close?

862
01:01:42.215 --> 01:01:43.119
The only thing I'm too close to

863
01:01:43.202 --> 01:01:44.981
is punching you in the face.

864
01:01:45.063 --> 01:01:45.996
Please don't.

865
01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:47.985
Stay away from my story.

866
01:01:49.052 --> 01:01:50.538
Whatever.

867
01:01:50.621 --> 01:01:52.666
There's no real facts.

868
01:01:52.748 --> 01:01:54.489
It's hardly even a story.

869
01:01:57.027 --> 01:01:59.195
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

870
01:02:06.202 --> 01:02:08.378
What do you mean,
she's not coming over?

871
01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.280
I'm making dinner
for her right now.

872
01:02:10.362 --> 01:02:12.260
Do you even
know what today was?

873
01:02:13.744 --> 01:02:15.498
What was today?

874
01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:18.268
Her school play
that you promised you'd come to.

875
01:02:18.353 --> 01:02:19.543
Shit.

876
01:02:19.628 --> 01:02:21.360
I'm not so sure that I
should let her stay with you

877
01:02:21.443 --> 01:02:23.023
when you're not even
responsible enough

878
01:02:23.108 --> 01:02:25.034
to show up for the easy stuff.

879
01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.498
I've... I've had a lot of things
on my mind.

880
01:02:27.581 --> 01:02:29.369
But apparently, Natalie
wasn't one of them.

881
01:02:32.094 --> 01:02:34.431
Okay, I... I deserve that.

882
01:02:34.514 --> 01:02:36.166
Yeah. You do.

883
01:02:37.233 --> 01:02:38.726
I'm... I'm coming over.

884
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:40.733
No.

885
01:02:40.815 --> 01:02:42.442
I want to apologize to her
personally.

886
01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.184
No, you and
your paranoia

887
01:02:44.268 --> 01:02:46.018
can't get out of your own way.

888
01:02:46.103 --> 01:02:47.184
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

889
01:02:47.266 --> 01:02:48.458
insecure, screwed up kid.

890
01:02:48.541 --> 01:02:50.614
You need to take care
of yourself, dad.

891
01:02:50.697 --> 01:02:52.516
Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

892
01:02:57.454 --> 01:02:59.304
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an...

893
01:02:59.387 --> 01:03:01.300
I'm not having you turn Natalie
into an insecure...

894
01:03:01.382 --> 01:03:02.632
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

895
01:03:02.715 --> 01:03:04.994
insecure, screwed up kid.

896
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.737
Hey, you've reached Mira.

897
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.315
You know what to do.

898
01:03:39.398 --> 01:03:43.407
Hi, Mira, it's me, Drew.
Just leaving the office now.

899
01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:46.603
Just wanted to say I'm a shit
for jumping your story.

900
01:03:48.405 --> 01:03:49.572
Hope you're feeling better.

901
01:03:54.143 --> 01:03:55.143
Um, I've got to go.

902
01:04:28.378 --> 01:04:30.146
You can't be serious.

903
01:05:04.347 --> 01:05:06.159
911,
what's your emergency?

904
01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:08.753
Yeah, I'm being chased
on the I-66.

905
01:05:10.253 --> 01:05:12.255
Oh, come on, really?

906
01:05:24.735 --> 01:05:26.135
Come on!

907
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:07.623
You okay, Drew?

908
01:06:07.706 --> 01:06:10.213
I don't... don't know.

909
01:06:35.605 --> 01:06:37.282
Just wanted to
say I'm a shit

910
01:06:37.364 --> 01:06:39.251
for jumping your story.

911
01:06:39.335 --> 01:06:40.744
Hope you're feeling better.

912
01:06:41.677 --> 01:06:42.764
Ah, I've got to go.

913
01:06:42.847 --> 01:06:45.518
See what I mean?
You can hear it in his voice.

914
01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:48.568
- Something happened.
- Yeah.

915
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:53.429
No, I hear you and see the dots
you're connecting, and, yes,

916
01:06:53.512 --> 01:06:57.467
that conclusion makes a lot of
sense right now, but...

917
01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:59.931
suggesting that the head of the
FBI had Drew killed

918
01:07:00.014 --> 01:07:01.974
because he printed a story?

919
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:04.556
- Sounds crazy, right?
- Right.

920
01:07:04.641 --> 01:07:05.862
Yeah.

921
01:07:05.947 --> 01:07:10.018
Listen, honey, we're all
heartbroken, okay?

922
01:07:10.101 --> 01:07:12.719
But the reality is, this is
probably just a bad accident,

923
01:07:12.802 --> 01:07:15.686
or road rage or I... I don't know
whatever it might have been.

924
01:07:15.771 --> 01:07:18.581
But honestly, at this point,
sitting here playing detective,

925
01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:21.358
it is not going to
solve anything

926
01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.320
including a conspiracy theory.

927
01:07:32.764 --> 01:07:35.532
Operation Unity.
That's what Dusty called it.

928
01:07:35.614 --> 01:07:36.976
That could mean anything.

929
01:07:37.059 --> 01:07:38.614
Dusty said that the FBI was

930
01:07:38.699 --> 01:07:40.831
crossing the line,
killing innocent civilians.

931
01:07:40.914 --> 01:07:42.360
His words.

932
01:07:42.445 --> 01:07:43.719
And that he was coming to me
with his story

933
01:07:43.804 --> 01:07:47.744
because of my articles
about Sofia Flores.

934
01:07:47.827 --> 01:07:48.661
I'm not following.

935
01:07:48.744 --> 01:07:50.523
Sofia Flores was an
innocent civilian

936
01:07:50.606 --> 01:07:53.416
killed in an accidental
hit-and-run, unless...

937
01:07:55.418 --> 01:07:57.420
unless it wasn't an accident.

938
01:07:58.722 --> 01:08:00.630
So you think she was murdered
by the FBI

939
01:08:00.713 --> 01:08:02.818
and that is what crossed
Dusty's line?

940
01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.650
Maybe.

941
01:08:04.735 --> 01:08:06.539
If what
you're saying is true,

942
01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:08.608
with the way the world
is right now,

943
01:08:08.692 --> 01:08:10.996
this could wipe out the
FBI's highest ranks.

944
01:08:11.079 --> 01:08:13.489
As it should.

945
01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:16.853
You do realize
if your dots are correct

946
01:08:16.936 --> 01:08:20.876
and we play this wrong,
we could both end up like Sofia.

947
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.512
And Dusty. And maybe Drew.

948
01:08:26.083 --> 01:08:27.717
Still wanna pursue it?

949
01:08:35.126 --> 01:08:36.648
We're sorry.

950
01:08:36.731 --> 01:08:39.027
The number you have reached
is not in service.

951
01:08:39.109 --> 01:08:40.395
Please check the...

952
01:08:42.564 --> 01:08:45.100
We're sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

953
01:08:45.184 --> 01:08:46.613
Sorry... Not in service...

954
01:08:46.698 --> 01:08:48.742
Please check the number
or try again.

955
01:08:48.826 --> 01:08:49.974
The number... Try again.

956
01:09:10.127 --> 01:09:11.680
I'm sorry, Mr. Block,

957
01:09:11.764 --> 01:09:13.756
but your granddaughter no longer
goes to school here.

958
01:09:13.841 --> 01:09:15.109
Since when?

959
01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:16.685
A few days ago.

960
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:19.108
Did her mother say
where they were moving?

961
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:20.814
- No.
- But her school records...

962
01:09:20.895 --> 01:09:22.505
They had to be
forwarded somewhere.

963
01:09:22.587 --> 01:09:23.720
No, no one asked.

964
01:09:23.804 --> 01:09:25.555
I'm not sure what happened.

965
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.912
I mean, usually we're given
plenty of notice...

966
01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.929
When did Amanda
quit the hospital?

967
01:09:32.011 --> 01:09:34.819
Amanda quit the hospital.
Amanda quit the hospital.

968
01:09:36.653 --> 01:09:38.564
No, no, no, everything's fine.

969
01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:40.497
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

970
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:41.761
When did you last hear
from Natalie?

971
01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.001
Natalie. Natalie.

972
01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:44.439
Natalie. No, no.

973
01:09:44.523 --> 01:09:45.844
Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.

974
01:09:45.926 --> 01:09:47.743
When did my daughter
quit the hospital?

975
01:09:47.826 --> 01:09:50.001
Amanda. Amanda. When did
you last hear from Natalie?

976
01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.877
Any idea where they might be?

977
01:09:51.961 --> 01:09:54.511
Any idea
where they might be?

978
01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:56.671
So, no idea where they might be.

979
01:09:58.073 --> 01:10:01.152
If fingers
need to be pointed,

980
01:10:01.234 --> 01:10:03.014
we know where to point them.

981
01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.077
Who is it?

982
01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:52.205
- It's me.
- Oh, God!

983
01:10:52.288 --> 01:10:54.832
It's okay, it's just Pearl.

984
01:10:56.265 --> 01:10:58.197
Thought I'd cheer you up.

985
01:10:58.279 --> 01:10:59.600
Dinner?

986
01:11:02.139 --> 01:11:03.692
What am I looking at?

987
01:11:03.774 --> 01:11:06.162
Dusty Crane's rap sheet
I pulled off the police wire.

988
01:11:06.247 --> 01:11:07.773
And?

989
01:11:07.854 --> 01:11:10.551
Now we know he was an
undercover Federal agent,

990
01:11:10.634 --> 01:11:11.591
so this shouldn't
have been in the.

991
01:11:11.675 --> 01:11:12.956
National Crime's main system.

992
01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:15.532
To protect his identity.

993
01:11:15.613 --> 01:11:17.702
- Which means it's fake.
- It's fake.

994
01:11:17.786 --> 01:11:19.934
The only reason to do that would
be to spread misinformation

995
01:11:20.015 --> 01:11:22.625
in order to discredit him
as a potential source.

996
01:11:23.859 --> 01:11:26.997
So someone like me
doesn't write his story.

997
01:11:27.081 --> 01:11:29.697
Okay, I could buy that.

998
01:11:29.779 --> 01:11:31.033
But who?

999
01:11:34.805 --> 01:11:37.140
- Travis.
- What did you do?

1000
01:11:37.224 --> 01:11:38.694
Senses return?

1001
01:11:38.777 --> 01:11:40.576
You ready to get back
in the saddle?

1002
01:11:40.658 --> 01:11:42.555
Where's my family?

1003
01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.689
How the hell would I know?

1004
01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:45.063
If I find out you had anything

1005
01:11:45.145 --> 01:11:48.286
to do with Amanda and my
granddaughter disappearing,

1006
01:11:48.368 --> 01:11:50.020
you're gonna need more men.

1007
01:11:52.988 --> 01:11:55.792
I don't have a clue what
you're going on about.

1008
01:11:56.725 --> 01:11:58.006
Now I know you've got a lot

1009
01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:00.604
swirling around that
skull of yours,

1010
01:12:00.685 --> 01:12:02.944
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

1011
01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:06.849
We always had
each other's back, remember?

1012
01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:10.877
Now, let's go to the office
and talk about saving souls.

1013
01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.715
I've told you before.
No. It's over.

1014
01:12:15.796 --> 01:12:17.295
That's your decision.

1015
01:12:17.377 --> 01:12:20.680
That's the wrong decision,
but yours.

1016
01:12:22.252 --> 01:12:23.787
Excuse me.

1017
01:12:28.689 --> 01:12:31.328
Last chance. Where are they?

1018
01:12:31.412 --> 01:12:33.019
We're the FBI.

1019
01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.903
We don't involve ourselves
in petty domestic disputes.

1020
01:12:36.987 --> 01:12:39.770
He touches the car again,
shoot him.

1021
01:12:43.974 --> 01:12:47.781
The great J. Edgar Hoover once
said, in a public forum no less,

1022
01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:50.890
that the purpose of
counter-intelligence action

1023
01:12:50.974 --> 01:12:55.752
is to disrupt and it is
immaterial whether facts exist

1024
01:12:55.836 --> 01:12:57.953
to substantiate the charge.

1025
01:13:00.823 --> 01:13:03.835
If I were to say that in
public today, I can just imagine

1026
01:13:03.917 --> 01:13:07.800
the media backlash that would
wash me out of this office.

1027
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.345
- It wouldn't be pretty, sir.
- No.

1028
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:13.742
Nowadays, this country is ruled
by gotcha moments on Twitter.

1029
01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:16.147
But that doesn't mean
it's still not the truth.

1030
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:20.917
Hoover had COINTELPRO,
and I have Operation Unity.

1031
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.956
And as unpopular as
what we do may sound,

1032
01:13:24.037 --> 01:13:27.225
History tells us that
spilling a little blood

1033
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:31.296
is absolutely necessary
to maintain law and order.

1034
01:13:31.381 --> 01:13:35.930
Now, either Crane didn't
understand that, or didn't care.

1035
01:13:36.015 --> 01:13:39.904
And now look at the mess
he's making me clean up.

1036
01:13:39.988 --> 01:13:44.220
What's worse is, he's infected
someone... dear to me.

1037
01:13:44.305 --> 01:13:45.390
Block.

1038
01:13:45.475 --> 01:13:47.814
Been a good friend, family,

1039
01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:49.984
for as long as I can remember.

1040
01:13:50.068 --> 01:13:52.774
Sir, I may be
out of line here, but...

1041
01:13:55.112 --> 01:13:57.081
would you like us
to have a word with him?

1042
01:13:58.814 --> 01:14:01.859
Someone in the FBI created
a false criminal record

1043
01:14:01.944 --> 01:14:05.197
for a Federal agent involved in
a secret FBI program.

1044
01:14:05.279 --> 01:14:08.095
That fake record was then sent
out on the police wire

1045
01:14:08.176 --> 01:14:10.729
so that the media
would ignore him.

1046
01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.411
Drew obviously didn't.

1047
01:14:12.493 --> 01:14:15.260
And now that agent
and Drew are both dead.

1048
01:14:15.341 --> 01:14:16.832
Interesting.

1049
01:14:18.335 --> 01:14:20.064
Almost.

1050
01:14:20.145 --> 01:14:22.770
We run that, and tomorrow we get
a simple, logical explanation.

1051
01:14:22.854 --> 01:14:24.153
We have no proof to refute it.

1052
01:14:24.234 --> 01:14:26.714
Or corrupt FBI agents
following us home.

1053
01:14:26.797 --> 01:14:28.023
- And then there's that.
- Fine.

1054
01:14:28.104 --> 01:14:29.957
You want more proof,
I'll just call the FBI

1055
01:14:30.042 --> 01:14:31.917
and ask for an interview with
the asshole that killed Dusty.

1056
01:14:32.002 --> 01:14:33.895
Mira, I know this is
frustrating,

1057
01:14:33.979 --> 01:14:35.854
but what we need is
an actual living person

1058
01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:37.435
who can help tell the story.

1059
01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.430
Someone with specifics who can
help fill in the basics.

1060
01:14:40.515 --> 01:14:44.287
The who, the what, the when.
And if we're lucky, the why.

1061
01:14:44.372 --> 01:14:45.877
The why is obvious.

1062
01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:48.180
Obvious to you
isn't good enough.

1063
01:14:48.261 --> 01:14:50.908
Listen, if we are dealing
with a corrupt head of the FBI,

1064
01:14:50.992 --> 01:14:52.911
they will cover up the cover up
with another cover up

1065
01:14:52.993 --> 01:14:54.444
and they'll spin it as
some top secret

1066
01:14:54.529 --> 01:14:56.045
national security operation
that hides

1067
01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:58.051
behind the veil of need-to-know.

1068
01:14:58.136 --> 01:15:01.747
The American people
need to know the truth.

1069
01:15:01.832 --> 01:15:03.452
That's what
I used to think.

1070
01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:05.189
And you don't anymore?

1071
01:15:05.273 --> 01:15:08.033
Honestly, undecided.

1072
01:15:08.117 --> 01:15:10.027
Sometimes I think
it's better to live

1073
01:15:10.109 --> 01:15:12.087
in the happiness of the unknown.

1074
01:15:13.488 --> 01:15:15.033
The United States government is

1075
01:15:15.118 --> 01:15:17.261
murdering its own
innocent citizens.

1076
01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:21.966
Yeah.

1077
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.835
That is messed up.

1078
01:15:26.002 --> 01:15:28.372
We need to nail these assholes.

1079
01:15:28.456 --> 01:15:30.091
Nothing? Nothing?

1080
01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:32.310
No forwarding address?
No phone records?

1081
01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:33.823
Would you be able to pull

1082
01:15:33.908 --> 01:15:35.948
school enrollment records
for Natalie Block?

1083
01:15:36.029 --> 01:15:37.524
Check the entire country.

1084
01:15:37.608 --> 01:15:39.194
Actually, Sam, one more thing.

1085
01:15:39.278 --> 01:15:40.948
Search all informants
who recently entered.

1086
01:15:41.033 --> 01:15:42.234
Witness Protection.

1087
01:15:42.319 --> 01:15:43.765
They may have changed
their last names,

1088
01:15:43.849 --> 01:15:45.389
but they would have kept
their first.

1089
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:47.332
Amanda and Natalie.

1090
01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:49.301
Okay. Hey... hey, Sam.

1091
01:15:49.386 --> 01:15:51.005
Let's keep this between us.

1092
01:15:51.087 --> 01:15:53.460
Do this for me,
consider us even.

1093
01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:54.529
Thanks, Sam.

1094
01:16:01.438 --> 01:16:03.393
Block.

1095
01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:05.555
Oh, yeah, uh, Mira.

1096
01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.779
Listen, uh, now's not
a good time.

1097
01:16:12.046 --> 01:16:13.895
What do you have?

1098
01:16:13.979 --> 01:16:15.399
Robinson's very capable

1099
01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:18.131
when it comes
to cleaning up his messes.

1100
01:16:18.215 --> 01:16:20.895
I would say this has his
fingerprints all over it.

1101
01:16:20.979 --> 01:16:24.337
I need a quote
from a reliable source.

1102
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.963
I'm the last person
you want as a source.

1103
01:16:27.047 --> 01:16:28.247
But you know it's wrong.

1104
01:16:28.328 --> 01:16:30.875
I know what I know,
but my hands are dirty.

1105
01:16:30.957 --> 01:16:33.337
You put my name out there,
my credibility,

1106
01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.140
it'll come into question.

1107
01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:36.292
Even my sanity.

1108
01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:38.147
They'll say I made the
whole thing up,

1109
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:41.416
all in the name of
protecting myself.

1110
01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:44.359
Probably wind up like Dusty.

1111
01:16:44.443 --> 01:16:46.024
I still don't understand
why Robinson

1112
01:16:46.109 --> 01:16:47.951
would go to all these lengths.

1113
01:16:48.984 --> 01:16:52.858
Same reason Hoover did it
for almost 50 years.

1114
01:16:52.939 --> 01:16:55.272
To maintain power, control,

1115
01:16:55.356 --> 01:16:58.372
which will give him a
shelf life that'll outlast

1116
01:16:58.453 --> 01:17:02.136
every politician on Capitol Hill
and in the White House.

1117
01:17:02.219 --> 01:17:04.313
You can't let them
get away with this.

1118
01:17:04.395 --> 01:17:07.310
I mean, this is your chance
to right all your wrongs.

1119
01:17:07.394 --> 01:17:10.011
What's done is done.
There's no going backwards.

1120
01:17:10.095 --> 01:17:12.046
Then let's go forward
and prevent Robinson

1121
01:17:12.131 --> 01:17:14.546
from abusing his power
in the future.

1122
01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:15.992
If we don't stand up to him,

1123
01:17:16.073 --> 01:17:17.979
he'll just keep growing
Operation Unity.

1124
01:17:18.979 --> 01:17:20.234
He probably will.

1125
01:17:20.319 --> 01:17:23.926
Remember, it's your job
to protect the agents.

1126
01:17:24.010 --> 01:17:25.462
How many more Dusty's
have to die for you

1127
01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:26.720
to stop looking the other way?

1128
01:17:31.929 --> 01:17:33.439
As long as I've worked
for Robinson,

1129
01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:37.064
I've... I've never heard
of Operation Unity.

1130
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:38.353
Somebody must know.

1131
01:17:38.435 --> 01:17:40.444
These sort of people
don't talk out of turn.

1132
01:17:40.529 --> 01:17:43.407
Maybe, but secrets
this big can't hide forever.

1133
01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:49.220
Robinson has a safe in his house

1134
01:17:49.305 --> 01:17:51.654
where he keeps a
record of everyone

1135
01:17:51.738 --> 01:17:54.122
and everything
the Bureau touches.

1136
01:17:54.206 --> 01:17:56.926
- Everything?
- Everything.

1137
01:17:57.011 --> 01:17:59.372
It's his security blanket,

1138
01:17:59.456 --> 01:18:03.569
ammunition in case anyone
decides to turn against him.

1139
01:18:03.653 --> 01:18:10.033
If there's a paper trail on
Operation Unity, it's in there.

1140
01:20:08.283 --> 01:20:10.493
What do you mean,
he blew up your car?

1141
01:20:10.578 --> 01:20:12.792
Block shot it
with a grenade launcher.

1142
01:20:17.828 --> 01:20:19.764
I must never
underestimate that man.

1143
01:20:22.466 --> 01:20:25.229
Where is the crazy
son-of-a-bitch now?

1144
01:20:25.313 --> 01:20:26.636
Don't know.

1145
01:20:27.636 --> 01:20:29.511
Well, I do.

1146
01:20:29.595 --> 01:20:30.662
He's here.

1147
01:20:30.746 --> 01:20:34.255
- Here as in?
- As in, my front door.

1148
01:20:34.337 --> 01:20:37.514
If you're not too busy,
you might wanna stop by.

1149
01:20:45.453 --> 01:20:47.189
Wasn't expecting you.

1150
01:20:48.492 --> 01:20:50.158
Got a minute?

1151
01:20:56.363 --> 01:20:59.112
- You sent them. Right.
- I sent who?

1152
01:20:59.194 --> 01:21:01.274
You know, if you were
just honest with me,

1153
01:21:01.359 --> 01:21:02.818
I'd have more respect for you.

1154
01:21:02.899 --> 01:21:05.211
I take it this isn't
a friendly pop in.

1155
01:21:05.295 --> 01:21:06.453
What the hell do you want?

1156
01:21:06.537 --> 01:21:08.819
All your files
on Operation Unity.

1157
01:21:08.903 --> 01:21:10.546
I'm afraid that's not happening.

1158
01:21:11.716 --> 01:21:13.483
It's not a request, Gabriel.

1159
01:21:15.185 --> 01:21:16.796
This is a huge mistake.

1160
01:21:16.881 --> 01:21:18.817
I'll add it to my list.
Open it.

1161
01:21:18.899 --> 01:21:20.412
Or what?

1162
01:21:20.497 --> 01:21:22.626
Are you really gonna
shoot me, Travis?

1163
01:21:23.627 --> 01:21:25.162
Yes, I will.

1164
01:21:30.902 --> 01:21:32.283
The hard drive.

1165
01:21:32.367 --> 01:21:34.167
I need to see what's on it.

1166
01:21:34.252 --> 01:21:35.706
Load it up.

1167
01:21:43.645 --> 01:21:45.314
Step aside.

1168
01:21:50.487 --> 01:21:53.157
The world isn't ready
to see what's on that drive.

1169
01:21:53.238 --> 01:21:55.368
The truth can be difficult,

1170
01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:57.461
but it's better than
the alternative.

1171
01:22:11.408 --> 01:22:12.944
You two, take the back.

1172
01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:13.738
I recommend you walk away.

1173
01:24:13.819 --> 01:24:16.010
This is not your fight.

1174
01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:18.399
You were just taking orders.

1175
01:24:41.993 --> 01:24:44.001
Robinson's using you.

1176
01:24:44.085 --> 01:24:45.828
The way he used me.

1177
01:24:48.064 --> 01:24:50.500
We're just bullets
in his chamber.

1178
01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:20.997
Enough is enough!

1179
01:27:58.956 --> 01:28:00.555
Travis.

1180
01:28:28.283 --> 01:28:30.599
- Who are you?
- Uh...

1181
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.225
This is Pearl.
She works with me.

1182
01:28:32.309 --> 01:28:34.759
Please don't shoot her.

1183
01:28:36.792 --> 01:28:38.622
Can we trust her with this?

1184
01:28:38.703 --> 01:28:40.131
We can.

1185
01:28:45.935 --> 01:28:47.858
Donuts? Really?

1186
01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:49.845
It... it was all I could
find in this dump.

1187
01:28:49.929 --> 01:28:52.011
So, Robinson hid
Amanda and Natalie

1188
01:28:52.095 --> 01:28:54.587
in Witness Protection?

1189
01:28:54.671 --> 01:28:56.613
But no idea where they are?

1190
01:28:57.314 --> 01:28:59.090
Uh-huh, okay.

1191
01:28:59.171 --> 01:29:00.202
Thanks, Sam.

1192
01:29:00.283 --> 01:29:02.551
Yeah. Appreciate you looking.

1193
01:29:09.926 --> 01:29:12.319
Using your family as leverage
against you is so effing wrong.

1194
01:29:12.404 --> 01:29:14.055
Sorry to say.

1195
01:29:14.139 --> 01:29:17.773
Seems relatively minor compared
to everything else he's doing.

1196
01:29:17.854 --> 01:29:21.137
Character assassinations,
political blackmail.

1197
01:29:21.221 --> 01:29:22.787
Looks like flat out murder.

1198
01:29:22.871 --> 01:29:25.948
All under the guise
of protecting democracy.

1199
01:29:26.029 --> 01:29:28.578
What does it say
about Dusty Crane?

1200
01:29:30.881 --> 01:29:32.185
Looks like you've got
everything you'd ever

1201
01:29:32.269 --> 01:29:33.323
want to know about him.

1202
01:29:33.407 --> 01:29:34.916
Oh, there's a video.

1203
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.118
Play it.

1204
01:29:37.252 --> 01:29:39.189
Dustin Crane, Special Agent.

1205
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:41.341
Your mission?

1206
01:29:41.426 --> 01:29:43.139
You know that.
It's deep infill.

1207
01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:46.368
Have you maintained
contact with the target?

1208
01:29:46.453 --> 01:29:49.336
Yes, the target's name
is Sofia Flores.

1209
01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:51.636
How often
is your exposure?

1210
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.850
Every day,
at least

1211
01:29:52.935 --> 01:29:54.680
a few hours a day,
sometimes longer.

1212
01:29:54.761 --> 01:29:55.988
How have you
been able to maintain that

1213
01:29:56.069 --> 01:29:59.180
level of contact with
an unsuspecting target?

1214
01:29:59.265 --> 01:30:02.179
She, uh, she thinks
I'm her boyfriend.

1215
01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:04.840
And?

1216
01:30:04.921 --> 01:30:06.850
Are you her boyfriend?

1217
01:30:08.152 --> 01:30:10.698
I'd like to think so.

1218
01:30:10.783 --> 01:30:12.854
How long has
this been going on?

1219
01:30:15.725 --> 01:30:18.109
A little over a year now.

1220
01:30:18.192 --> 01:30:20.898
And she has
no idea who you really are?

1221
01:30:22.233 --> 01:30:24.835
No, no. No, she doesn't.

1222
01:30:29.439 --> 01:30:31.711
You can see
it in his face.

1223
01:30:31.795 --> 01:30:33.711
They were in love.

1224
01:30:34.743 --> 01:30:36.645
I feel sick.

1225
01:31:02.206 --> 01:31:05.051
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

1226
01:31:05.134 --> 01:31:09.103
You knew Dusty Crane was
in love with Sofia Flores.

1227
01:31:09.185 --> 01:31:10.072
Travis!

1228
01:31:10.154 --> 01:31:12.157
You got nervous he might
come clean to her.

1229
01:31:12.238 --> 01:31:14.127
The thought that someone
with her influence

1230
01:31:14.210 --> 01:31:16.417
might find out what you were
up to scared you.

1231
01:31:16.501 --> 01:31:18.430
You slippery shit.

1232
01:31:18.515 --> 01:31:19.938
Pull the damn car over.

1233
01:31:20.020 --> 01:31:22.763
That's why you killed her,
and then him.

1234
01:31:22.846 --> 01:31:24.729
To protect your
secret operation.

1235
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:26.828
You know nothing.

1236
01:31:31.135 --> 01:31:32.087
Listen carefully.

1237
01:31:32.171 --> 01:31:35.242
Operation Unity is going public.
The whole thing.

1238
01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:37.376
- Bullshit.
- You need to listen.

1239
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:39.076
Not to you, I don't.

1240
01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:43.779
How about now?

1241
01:31:45.479 --> 01:31:47.457
Our arrangement never happened.

1242
01:31:47.542 --> 01:31:49.063
You're going to destroy my file

1243
01:31:49.145 --> 01:31:51.024
and forget everything
I've done for you.

1244
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:52.832
After that, you will go public

1245
01:31:52.916 --> 01:31:54.462
with the truth
about the operation.

1246
01:31:54.546 --> 01:31:56.270
I am the director of the most

1247
01:31:56.353 --> 01:31:59.435
powerful organization
in the world.

1248
01:31:59.518 --> 01:32:02.304
I will not bargain with you.

1249
01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:04.220
Then call it coercion.

1250
01:32:04.304 --> 01:32:07.304
If I'm not being convincing
enough, there are other ways.

1251
01:32:32.997 --> 01:32:35.837
Fine. We'll do it your way.

1252
01:32:35.921 --> 01:32:37.353
I'll clean your record.

1253
01:32:37.435 --> 01:32:41.078
But there is no chance in hell
I am admitting to anything,

1254
01:32:41.162 --> 01:32:45.313
and if I hear a whisper
of Operation Unity in the press,

1255
01:32:45.395 --> 01:32:48.779
you'll be indicted
before the day is over.

1256
01:32:50.514 --> 01:32:54.988
That was the last threat
you will ever make to me.

1257
01:32:55.073 --> 01:32:57.354
You wanna put a bullet
in your old friend?

1258
01:32:59.390 --> 01:33:01.411
Go ahead.

1259
01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:03.926
You'd be doing me a favor.

1260
01:33:04.895 --> 01:33:06.363
Please, do it.

1261
01:33:08.131 --> 01:33:09.466
Do it!

1262
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:15.166
No.

1263
01:33:15.250 --> 01:33:16.979
You're not getting
off that easy.

1264
01:33:17.063 --> 01:33:18.921
The truth needs to be told.

1265
01:33:19.005 --> 01:33:21.854
And you're gonna be
the one to tell it.

1266
01:33:21.938 --> 01:33:25.814
But first, you tell me.
Where's my family?

1267
01:33:57.648 --> 01:33:59.216
There she is!

1268
01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:00.402
Grandpa!

1269
01:34:00.484 --> 01:34:03.203
Hey, come here to me.

1270
01:34:03.286 --> 01:34:05.322
You don't need to worry,
nobody's out there.

1271
01:34:05.404 --> 01:34:07.037
I've already checked.

1272
01:34:07.122 --> 01:34:09.064
Good, and there
probably never will be.

1273
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:11.118
That's just how
my brain is wired.

1274
01:34:11.203 --> 01:34:12.310
I know.

1275
01:34:12.394 --> 01:34:13.578
I missed you.

1276
01:34:13.662 --> 01:34:15.233
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1277
01:34:15.314 --> 01:34:16.554
Everything okay?

1278
01:34:16.636 --> 01:34:18.345
Just never thought we'd
be in Witness Protection.

1279
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:20.511
- Sorry about all that.
- It's alright. We're fine.

1280
01:34:20.595 --> 01:34:23.180
I'm just sorry about everything
that you've been through.

1281
01:34:23.264 --> 01:34:25.309
- Is everything okay with you?
- Couldn't be better.

1282
01:34:26.076 --> 01:34:28.947
- Anybody wanna go home?
- I do!

1283
01:34:29.029 --> 01:34:30.948
- I do!
- Me, too.

1284
01:34:32.613 --> 01:34:35.354
"Robinson was indicted
after admitting to the existence

1285
01:34:35.439 --> 01:34:37.091
of the morally
reprehensible program

1286
01:34:37.175 --> 01:34:39.368
he dubbed Operation Unity.

1287
01:34:39.453 --> 01:34:42.027
He remains behind bars,
awaiting trial."

1288
01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:43.527
Look at these comments.

1289
01:34:43.609 --> 01:34:45.514
"Explosive."

1290
01:34:45.595 --> 01:34:48.069
"The News Cycle at its finest."

1291
01:34:48.152 --> 01:34:49.212
Don't forget this one.

1292
01:34:49.296 --> 01:34:51.167
"Award-worthy reporting."

1293
01:34:52.136 --> 01:34:53.904
I'm proud of you, Mira.

1294
01:34:59.743 --> 01:35:01.130
I saw it.

1295
01:35:01.212 --> 01:35:03.287
Well, what do you think?

1296
01:35:03.371 --> 01:35:06.702
Very thorough.
I, uh...

1297
01:35:06.783 --> 01:35:11.122
I was surprised you didn't
mention my Vietnam mishap.

1298
01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:12.533
No use for you being on trial

1299
01:35:12.618 --> 01:35:15.125
for something you did
when you were a kid.

1300
01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:23.270
Article's good.

1301
01:35:23.353 --> 01:35:24.448
Thank you.

1302
01:35:24.532 --> 01:35:27.386
For... everything.

1303
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:29.685
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1304
01:35:29.770 --> 01:35:34.545
And I wouldn't have done it
without you, so... thank you.

1305
01:35:35.747 --> 01:35:37.287
You're welcome.

1306
01:35:37.372 --> 01:35:39.280
Take care, Mira.

1307
01:35:39.364 --> 01:35:40.515
You too.

1308
01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.323
Ah, a little help, please.

1309
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:49.960
Run, run, run!
Keep running!

1310
01:35:50.795 --> 01:35:52.604
Go! That's a girl.

1311
01:35:52.689 --> 01:35:54.345
That's it, keep going.

1312
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.524
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's flying! It's flying!

1313
01:35:57.609 --> 01:35:58.621
Atta girl.

1314
01:35:58.703 --> 01:35:59.970
You're pretty good at that.

1315
01:36:00.055 --> 01:36:03.295
A bit rusty. Go!

1316
01:36:03.377 --> 01:36:05.701
You sure you don't wanna hang
out with us this weekend?

1317
01:36:05.783 --> 01:36:07.310
I'm good.

1318
01:36:08.612 --> 01:36:10.029
I have a date.

1319
01:36:10.113 --> 01:36:12.162
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we'll see.

1320
01:36:12.246 --> 01:36:14.081
But if you or Natalie need
anything, just let me know.

1321
01:36:14.162 --> 01:36:15.198
Uh-huh. Will do.

1322
01:36:15.283 --> 01:36:16.600
And don't forget to feed her.

1323
01:36:16.684 --> 01:36:18.088
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, get her to school

1324
01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.336
on time, Monday morning.

1325
01:36:19.417 --> 01:36:21.689
Food, teeth, school.
Consider it done.

1326
01:36:21.773 --> 01:36:23.260
Anything else?

1327
01:36:24.161 --> 01:36:26.363
No shooting guns.

1328
01:36:28.532 --> 01:36:30.131
No guns.

1329
01:36:32.368 --> 01:36:34.171
Where do you stand
on explosives?
