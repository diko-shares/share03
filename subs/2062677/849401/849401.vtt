<i>Deck the halls
with boughs of holly...</i>

3
00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:02.328
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la!</i>

4
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.762
<i>Tis the season to be jolly...</i>

5
00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:09.301
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la!</i>

6
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.633
<i>Don we now our white apparel...</i>

7
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.004
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la!</i>

8
00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.545
<i>Troll the ancient Yule tide carol</i>

9
00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.342
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la...</i>

10
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:23.746
What, in blue blazes!

11
00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:27.683
Grouchy's house is as bare
as a Smurflings bottom.

12
00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:31.324
Oh, my!

13
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.384
Grouchy, what's wrong?

14
00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:37.826
<i>Oh, you mean other than being
bothered by carolers...</i>

15
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.489
<i>who aren't even in tune, by the way.</i>

16
00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.093
- Uuph, ... what's gotten into him?
- What do you mean?

17
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.869
He's always ... uh ...
Grouchy.

18
00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.633
Yeah, but not at the holidays.

19
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.936
Yeah, you always decorate for
the holidays.

20
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.408
Uh, ... I hate decorations.

21
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.247
Okay, but you're still coming to
the big party tonight, right?

22
00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.575
Every Smurf helps decorate the tree.

23
00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.949
You call that puny twig a tree?

24
00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:02.855
Huh, huh, count me out.

25
00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:05.319
But, we always decorate 
as a family.

26
00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.087
Yeah, and you always put the star
on top of the tree.

27
00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.158
He's right, Grouchy. That very important
task belongs to you.

28
00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.960
You know what?  I hate tasks.

29
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:19.297
I hate stars, mistletoe,
candy canes, stockings and fruit cake!

30
00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:22.071
I ... hate ... Christmas!

31
00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:27.680
How can someone hate fruit cake? 
 It's delicious.

32
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:30.215
Oh, Papa, you need to do something.

33
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.985
It just won't be the same if we
can't all celebrate together.

34
00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.639
Humm, ... I have an idea.

35
00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:39.856
Oh, ... 

36
00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:43.025
A dash of nutmeg...

37
00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:44.922
A touch of holly ...

38
00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.759
What exactly is this potion, Papa ?

39
00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.033
The Christmas Spirit,
designed to show one

40
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:52.133
the true meaning of the holiday.

41
00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.502
And, now... the final ingredient...

42
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.303
Essence of Smurf.

43
00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:30.102
<i>Fa la la la la la la la,
LAME!</i>

44
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.108
How do you Smurf a hall, anyway?

45
00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.307
Ugh, I hate warm Smurfberry nog.

46
00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.542
But. I also hate
being thirsty.

47
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.029
I suddenly ... feel ... sleepy ...

48
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.612
Who turned out the lights?

49
00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.658
Wow, my stomach is looking flat.

50
00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:27.097
What's up there?

51
00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.391
I got a blue belt in Smurf-Fu.

52
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.464
And, I'm not afraid to use it.

53
00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:39.537
You really should sweep that
thing once in a while.

54
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.512
- Smurfette?
- I'm the Smurf of Christmas past.

55
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:46.709
Don't you see my Smurfy wings?

56
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.554
I shouldn't have had that second
glass of Smurfberry nog.

57
00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.116
Oh, go away...

58
00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:58.122
You're just a figment of my indigestion.

59
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.201
No! I'm one of three spirits 

60
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:02.565
that's going to visit you tonight.

61
00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.603
It seems that you have lost
the true meaning of Christmas.

62
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.230
Our job is to help you
find it.

63
00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.035
I think I'll pass.

64
00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.634
Feel free to use the door
on your way out.

65
00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.306
Oh, I'm not leaving until I take you

66
00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.773
on a magical journey back in time!

67
00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:25.650
Hey, congratulations! 
Nothing happened.

68
00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.559
What the...?

69
00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:33.195
Oh, I hate mornings.

70
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.862
Except for Christmas morning.

71
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.700
- Hey, it's me.
- It is you.

72
00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.942
But, a you from long, long ago.

73
00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.742
Presents, here I come.

74
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:47.647
Christmas way always the one time of

75
00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:49.804
year when you put your grouchyness aside. 

76
00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:53.010
<i>Jingle Smurfs, jingle Smurfs,
jingle all the way...</i>

77
00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.316
If you ask me,
that's so annoying...

78
00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.757
Wierd, right?

79
00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.724
Wait til you see this.

80
00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.395
Neat, huh?

81
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.086
Gee, I remember this.

82
00:06:38.298 --> 00:06:40.664
And, here you come now.

83
00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.230
- Merry Christmas, Grouchy.
- Yeah, Merry Christmas.

84
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.306
Merry Christmas!

85
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.170
The sooner I get to my chair,

86
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.306
the sooner I get to open my presents.

87
00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:53.507
- Merry Christmas, Grouchy!
- Merry Christmas!

88
00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.912
- Merry Christmas, Grouchy!
- Merry Christmas, Grouchy!

89
00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.210
Yeah, Merry Christmas!

90
00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.579
Merry Christmas, Grouchy !

91
00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:00.983
Yeah, Merry Christmas!

92
00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.106
I don't have time for this.

93
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:28.847
Seriously!

94
00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:31.848
We've got to get to our seats now.
Enough's enough.

95
00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.220
Come on. Let's dance!

96
00:07:38.324 --> 00:07:40.189
- I hate dancing.
- Really?

97
00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.823
That's not what it looks like to me.

98
00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.382
<i>Gather around, Smurfs.</i>

99
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.711
Gather around, everyone.

100
00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.313
Hurry up, Grouchy.
It's time to open your presents.

101
00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:18.758
Oh! This was a long time ago.

102
00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.999
Please, let me get it. Please let me
get it. Please, let me get it.

103
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.661
- Get, what?
- What I asked for for Christmas.

104
00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.165
A hang glider.

105
00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.534
It's like a giant paper airplane
you can fly in.

106
00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:31.768
I know. It's got to be the Smurf.

107
00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.140
For you.

108
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.375
And, for you. And, for you.

109
00:08:37.283 --> 00:08:38.614
Merry Christmas!

110
00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.884
For you. And, for you.

111
00:08:42.455 --> 00:08:43.820
It's not very big.

112
00:08:43.923 --> 00:08:45.788
All right. Open them up.

113
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:48.955
A new hat!

114
00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.490
A new hat!

115
00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:52.120
- A new hat!
- A new hat!

116
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.425
- A new hat!
- A new hat!

117
00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.625
A new hat!

118
00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:56.767
Oh! A new hat!

119
00:08:57.804 --> 00:09:00.295
A new hat!... Again.

120
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.805
All I ever wanted was that hng glider.

121
00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:08.377
Every year I asked Papa for it.
But, did he ever come through?

122
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.573
Let's find out.

123
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.042
<i>Christmas</i>

124
00:09:13.352 --> 00:09:15.244
And, then a few years later,

125
00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:17.186
and every year after that...

126
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.279
Seriously!

127
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.019
Then, there was ... last year.

128
00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:23.921
Hey, look.
Papa, asked me to give that to you.

129
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.054
LOOK!

130
00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:29.234
Finally!

131
00:09:32.171 --> 00:09:34.002
Ha, ha, ... killing!
Here's the real gift.

132
00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.267
Whoa! ... A new hat!

133
00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:46.709
Isn't Christmas about giving
what you want?

134
00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.287
Well, I want a hang glider!

135
00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:52.641
Why do I even bother to
celebrate Christmas,

136
00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:54.724
 if all I ever get ... is this?

137
00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:57.825
The same old boring, useless hat!

138
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.457
I mean, how many hats
does a Smurf need?

139
00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:04.594
Uh, who asked you?

140
00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.703
I ... hate ... hats!

141
00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:21.517
And, that's why you decided
to hate Christmas?

142
00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:25.085
Don't get your hopes up,
if all you'll get is disappointed?

143
00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:27.049
What's there to be disappointed about ...

144
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:30.026
when you're surrounded by
such a Smurfy family?

145
00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.188
One annoying family.

146
00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:35.626
Could have used that hang glider to fly
away for some peace and quiet.

147
00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:38.531
Well, if you wanted to fly,
then let's go.

148
00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:40.569
You've got somewhere to be.

149
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:46.009
You're heavier than you look..

150
00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:51.549
Sorry! I'm new at this.

151
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:54.920
Hey, ... Wedgy! Wedgy! Wedgy!

152
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.182
Watch where you're going!

153
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.183
Sorry!

154
00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:25.215
I hate falling!

155
00:11:30.456 --> 00:11:31.889
Nice of you to drop in.

156
00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:33.859
Brainy?

157
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.428
I'm afraid you are incorrect ...
on your assumption,

158
00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.065
for I am the Smurf of Christmas present.

159
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.366
Then, where are the presents?

160
00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.935
I'm here to show you how your
hatred of Christmas ...

161
00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:45.867
is going to affect the
whole village.

162
00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:47.670
What are you talking about?

163
00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:51.441
Every Christmas I would just put 
up a couple of decorations.

164
00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:55.571
Papa, would make me put a
star ... on top of the tree.

165
00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:58.673
Every action, no matter how small,
has a reaction.

166
00:11:58.851 --> 00:11:59.818
Behold!

167
00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:03.717
Because you decided not to help
decorate the tree ...

168
00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:05.723
Chef had to step in and
had to help with the ornaments ...

169
00:12:05.825 --> 00:12:08.794
instead of baking his traditional
gingerSmurf cookies ...

170
00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:12.352
which had an expotentional effect on the
rate of Christmas cheer per Smurf...

171
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:15.491
that, when multiplied by the square root
of total ...

172
00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.666
Grouchy, why do I bother?
Just watch.

173
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.838
I have my Christmas decorations

174
00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.904
Oh, the star for the top of the tree!

175
00:12:29.348 --> 00:12:31.407
Oh, but Grouchy isn't here.

176
00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.845
Hey! I'll take care of it.

177
00:12:33.953 --> 00:12:36.114
- No, Clumsy.
- No, no, no!

178
00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.693
- The stockings!
- The stockings!

179
00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:02.910
Uh, well, at least,
 the fire's out, he, he.

180
00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:06.578
No!

181
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.983
Out of the way, Smurfs!

182
00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.430
This wouldn't have happen if
 Grouchy was here.

183
00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:23.663
Every Smurf, plays an important
part, you see?

184
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.498
Yeah, I see.

185
00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:27.229
Not yet, you don't.

186
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:32.333
There we are, now, just the
way Greedy likes it ...

187
00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.738
with a little pocket inside,
to keep extra Smurfberries.

188
00:13:37.183 --> 00:13:42.211
Tailor will be delighted with
the extra large, built-in, pin cushion.

189
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:45.356
Papa makes all of our
hats, himself ...

190
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:50.452
And, crafts each one to meet the
particular needs of every Smurf.

191
00:13:50.563 --> 00:13:51.757
Takes him all year.

192
00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:55.959
Grouchy, I made a hat I know
you'll love ...

193
00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.300
If, only you'd give it a chance.

194
00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.630
Well, maybe this year.

195
00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:07.143
Papa, I didn't know.

196
00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:11.978
He can't hear you.

197
00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:13.745
It's time to go.

198
00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:20.748
Hey, Brainy!  Where did you go?

199
00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:30.435
Brainy, is that you?

200
00:14:33.506 --> 00:14:36.168
Sorry, bro, just finishing
up the holiday fruitcake.

201
00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:39.271
But, I already know your
feelings on that.

202
00:14:39.578 --> 00:14:43.105
- Hefty?
- No, not Hefty, you lump of coal.

203
00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:46.818
I am the Smurf of Christmas future.

204
00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:48.653
Where the future is ...

205
00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:56.661
This?

206
00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.260
This is the future?

207
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.763
In a manner of speaking.

208
00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:04.603
It's tomorrow.

209
00:15:05.237 --> 00:15:06.568
It's Christmas day.

210
00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.071
Christmas day?

211
00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:10.108
Then, where is everyone?

212
00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.608
They all left this morning ...

213
00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:15.810
wanted to do something to help you
get your Christmas Spirit back.

214
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.974
<i>I know how to make Grouchy happy.</i>

215
00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:20.443
<i>How about we all go and get
a new tree in the morning?</i>

216
00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:22.953
<i>One of those huge Smurfy ones
from the West forest.</i>

217
00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:25.023
<i>- That'll cheer him up.
- That's a great idea.</i>

218
00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:27.217
<i>- For Grouchy.
- Yes, for Grouchy.</i>

219
00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.521
<i>This will make everyone happy.</i>

220
00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:32.493
Then, what happened?

221
00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.555
They never came back.

222
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.362
Never came back?

223
00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:38.603
W-what do you mean?

224
00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.166
The West forest...

225
00:15:44.877 --> 00:15:45.844
Smurfette !

226
00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:47.512
Brainy !

227
00:15:48.614 --> 00:15:49.706
Clumsy...

228
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.509
Need to do more cardio, Bro. 

229
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:05.087
Brainy, wouldn't go anywhere
without these.

230
00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.137
Where are they?

231
00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:23.439
No!

232
00:16:26.385 --> 00:16:27.682
Gargamel's lair!

233
00:16:28.654 --> 00:16:29.882
It can't be ...

234
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.252
It can, actually.

235
00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:34.156
What about the others?

236
00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:36.987
I thought you were going to take
 me to the others.

237
00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:38.253
Oh, I have.

238
00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:41.794
Oh, no.

239
00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:44.192
All of them.

240
00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:46.936
They were all captured ...

241
00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:49.964
trying to make me happy.

242
00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:54.778
When Papa came looking for them,
Gargamel, got him, too.

243
00:16:57.716 --> 00:16:59.240
I'm so selfish.

244
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.080
Well, on the bright side ...

245
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.926
looks like, you'll all get to spend

246
00:17:02.976 --> 00:17:04.917
one last Christmas together, after all.

247
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.255
Merry Christmas ... to me!

248
00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.454
Hefty ! Hefty !

249
00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:34.912
I see you've met Santa CLAWS!

250
00:17:57.009 --> 00:18:00.137
You're going to look great
on top of my tree.

251
00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:05.807
Help!

252
00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.846
Oh, no!

253
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.228
No!

254
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.198
No, it can't end like this!

255
00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.097
I can change!

256
00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:29.273
I can change. I can change.

257
00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:31.542
I can change.

258
00:18:33.746 --> 00:18:35.008
Where am I?

259
00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:38.976
I'm back! And, I'm alive!

260
00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:44.618
It's not Christmas morning, yet.

261
00:18:45.257 --> 00:18:47.725
There's still time to set things right.

262
00:19:10.049 --> 00:19:11.277
What is that?

263
00:19:18.757 --> 00:19:20.054
- Oh!
- Wow!

264
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:24.627
- It's incredible.
- Look at this.

265
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:28.156
Oh, well, look who's finally up.

266
00:19:28.967 --> 00:19:30.992
Grouchy, you did all this?

267
00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.600
I even baked a fruitcake.

268
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.570
And, I was wrong.

269
00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:38.802
Christmas isn't a time for hating.

270
00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:40.936
That's what all the other days are for.

271
00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:43.412
I was so busy focusing on
what I wanted ...

272
00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.574
didn't see the real gift ...

273
00:19:47.419 --> 00:19:49.410
is having a family ... that cares ...

274
00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:52.223
even though, I'm grouchy.

275
00:19:52.925 --> 00:19:54.415
Merry Christmas!

276
00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:58.428
I know, it's not the hang glider
you always ask for ...

277
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.897
but I made it just for you.

278
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.230
Thanks Papa.  A new hat!

279
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.073
Oh, ... I made it for all of us.

280
00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:22.781
Merry Christmas, everyone!

281
00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.923
- Yea!
- Merry Christmas!

282
00:20:26.992 --> 00:20:30.985
Hey, wait a minute ...
If Papa knew I wanted a hang glider ...

283
00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:33.690
Remember,
it's just for you.

284
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.396
Merry Christmas, everyone!

285
00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:49.414
Oh, no.

286
00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.739
I hate snow!

287
00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:55.817
And, I hate being cold.
And, I hate carrots!

288
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:59.584
But, most of all ...
I hate Christmas ...

289
00:20:59.585 --> 00:21:01.822
is only once a year!

290
00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:09.125
<i>Smurf the halls with 
boughs of holly...</i>

291
00:21:09.234 --> 00:21:14.433
<i>Fa la la la la la la la la!</i>

292
00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.503
Merry Christmas!

293
