1
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680
It's them!

2
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Get ready.

3
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.680
Two more prisoners coming in!

4
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.760
Prepare for docking!

5
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.640
In position!

6
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.520
Easy!

7
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.960
Gate secure!

8
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.440
Prisoner walking!

9
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.800
Ready the cell!

10
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.160
Oh, great. Another cellmate.

11
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.760
No offense, pal. You seem lovely.

12
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800
Let's show you around.
Get you situated here.

13
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.000
This is the bucket
where our pee freezes. And...

14
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
Yeah, that's it.

15
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.520
What's your name, lass?

16
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.280
That's Holga. I'm Edgin.

17
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360
And you are?

18
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.680
I've been in a lot of cells.
Never shared one with a female.

19
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.520
Think I'm gonna like it.

20
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.680
Word of advice

21
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.920
Holga doesn't love to be disturbed
while she's eating her potatoes.

22
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.600
Kind of the highlight of her day.

23
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.680
Shut up, you!

24
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.600
Sure thing. Have at it.

25
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.120
Little shy, eh?

26
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
I'm not so bad
once you get to know me.

27
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.920
Don't be like that.

28
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.360
We could be very happy to...

29
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.280
I think I'm gonna do this
without fingers and make it a mitten.

30
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.200
Who am I trying to impress?

31
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.720
<i>Not fortune found, nor fate divine</i>

32
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.200
<i>Come close to toping
the juice of the vine</i>

33
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
<i>With cherry crew, we sip and sway</i>

34
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.920
<i>Let's tip the tankard
and waste the day</i>

35
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.840
Stop that singing!

36
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.680
You got it, Tobias.

37
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.200
The Absolution Council is tomorrow.

38
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.600
Don't get your hopes up, Ed.

39
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.960
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120
Jarnathan is on the council
this time. He's an Aarakocra.

41
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.960
If anyone's gonna free us, it's him.

42
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.680
Not gonna happen.

43
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.360
I tell you, Holga,
this is your last day chopping ice.

44
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.920
By authority of the Lords' Alliance

45
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.480
this Absolution Council
will now come to order

46
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.400
in the case of Edgin Darvis
and Holga Kilgore.

47
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.160
This is the second year
of incarceration

48
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.280
for the crimes of grand larceny
and skullduggery.

49
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.200
It is the task of this council

50
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.360
to determine your eligibility
for pardon.

51
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.560
What say you?

52
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.600
Thank you, Chancellor Anderton,
esteemed members of the council.

53
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.320
Before I begin, I notice that
Chancellor Jarnathan is not present.

54
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.960
Should we perhaps wait?

55
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.200
Chancellor Jarnathan
was delayed by the storm.

56
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280
You may begin.

57
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.600
I see. It's just that I-...

58
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.200
we were really counting
on him to attend.

59
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.640
Begin or waive your statement.

60
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.960
Very well.

61
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.520
I should start
by giving you some context.

62
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.920
You may be surprised to learn
I wasn't always a thief.

63
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.480
<i>Years ago, I became a member
of the Harpers faction</i>

64
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.680
<i>a network of spies
who swear an oath to fight tyranny</i>

65
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.960
<i>defend the oppressed
and to ask nothing in return.</i>

66
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.840
<i>My wife, Zia, supported my decision,
even though she knew the risks.</i>

67
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.240
<i>By day, I'd eavesdrop on mercenaries</i>

68
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.520
<i>stop bandits in their tracks...</i>

69
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.440
<i>and even bring Thayan Red Wizards
to justice.</i>

70
00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.360
<i>By night, I'd come home to
my loving wife, and daughter, Kira.</i>

71
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.200
<i>To be honest, there were times
when I began to question</i>

72
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.320
<i>the "asking nothing in return"
part of my oath.</i>

73
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.720
<i>But my wife would always say</i>

74
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.280
<i>"You don't have to give us everything</i>

75
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.600
<i>you only have to give us you."</i>

76
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.976
So what's the latest on Jarnathan?

77
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.440
Is he close by? Because I can wait.

78
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.080
Did you not hear what we said?

79
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.880
Right, the storm. It's just that
based on what I know about Jarnathan

80
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.360
I think he'd be especially
receptive to my story.

81
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.696
And I'd hate to have to wait a whole
other year to come back in here

82
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.800
- and...
- Proceed.

83
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.960
Absolutely. Here we go.

84
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.200
<i>When you're a Harper,
you're bound to make enemies.</i>

85
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.880
<i>And sometimes those enemies
come looking for revenge.</i>

86
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.320
<i>No cleric can repair the damage
from a Red Wizard's blade.</i>

87
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.400
<i>There was no way to revive her.</i>

88
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.360
<i>When Zia died,
so did my devotion to my oath.</i>

89
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.360
I'm sorry, it's just
hard to relive this...

90
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.440
without Jarnathan here.

91
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.520
Again with this?

92
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.656
But he missed the most important part
of my backstory!

93
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.840
How can he judge me
without knowing my motivation?

94
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.560
We are entirely capable of deciding
your case without Jarnathan.

95
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.440
- Get on with it!
- Fine. Where was I?

96
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.560
<i>By night, I'd come home to
my loving wife, and daughter Kira.</i>

97
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.400
You went back too far. Stop stalling!

98
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.920
Right, sorry. Yeah, broad strokes.

99
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.240
<i>The next few months
were among my most shameful.</i>

100
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.480
<i>That's when I met Holga.</i>

101
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.280
<i>She took pity on me.</i>

102
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.480
<i>Well, she took pity on the baby.</i>

103
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.640
<i>Holga was a fellow resident
of rock bottom.</i>

104
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.360
<i>Many years before,
she'd been cast out of her tribe</i>

105
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.400
<i>for falling in love with an outsider.</i>

106
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.760
<i>We quickly became
like brother and sister.</i>

107
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.240
<i>With a relationship built
on trust and mutual respect.</i>

108
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.800
<i>Neither of us had money
or an honest way to earn it</i>

109
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.920
<i>so we decided to table "honest"
and we tried something new.</i>

110
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.120
<i>It's intoxicating when you realize</i>

111
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.640
<i>that what separates you
from what you've always wanted</i>

112
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.560
<i>can be as thin as a pane of glass.</i>

113
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.000
<i>You may be wondering how we could
carry on this criminal lifestyle</i>

114
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.320
<i>with a young girl at home.</i>

115
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.680
<i>Well, we didn't leave her at home.</i>

116
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.760
- Come on, come on.
- Hurry, hurry!

117
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.880
- Oi! Halt!
- Run, run, run!

118
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.480
<i>Kira wasn't the only new recruit.
We also added Simon, a so-so sorcerer</i>

119
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.440
<i>and a con man named Forge,
who pushed us to aim even higher.</i>

120
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.360
<i>Before long, we became a team.</i>

121
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.640
<i>Yes, we were thieves, but I tried
to hold us to a certain standard.</i>

122
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.040
<i>We never harmed anyone.</i>

123
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.120
<i>And we only robbed from those
who would feel it the least.</i>

124
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.560
<i>But everything changed
when we met the wizard Sofina.</i>

125
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.320
<i>We knew almost nothing about her.</i>

126
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.640
<i>Only that she wanted our help
in robbing Korinn's Keep.</i>

127
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.816
<i>That's a Harper stronghold.
I don't know if you've heard of it.</i>

128
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.680
<i>I'm sure Jarnathan has.</i>

129
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.560
<i>The keep was filled
with the priceless relics</i>

130
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.680
<i>seized from evildoers</i>

131
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.320
<i>and only Harpers could
gain access to the vault.</i>

132
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.240
<i>Which is why Sofina came to us.</i>

133
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.160
<i>At first, I refused.
I wouldn't stoop that low.</i>

134
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.400
<i>But then Forge told me that
among the relics in Korinn's Keep</i>

135
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.840
<i>there was a Tablet of Reawakening</i>

136
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.760
<i>capable of bringing back
a single deceased person.</i>

137
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.480
<i>Even one killed
by a Red Wizard's blade.</i>

138
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.040
<i>You can probably see
where this is going.</i>

139
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
Why can't I come?

140
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.400
Sorry, Kir, this one's too dangerous.

141
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.080
Then you shouldn't go.

142
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.520
We have everything that we need.

143
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.400
Not yet. But this is the last one.

144
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
Trust me.

145
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.400
Chin up, Bug. We'll be right back.

146
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.056
I didn't tell her about the tablet.

147
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.696
It would break her heart
if it all went to shit.

148
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.000
And, well

149
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.040
to shit it went.

150
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.960
See you soon, love.

151
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.360
Intruders!

152
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680
There they are!

153
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.760
We don't hurt anyone.

154
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200
She's caught in the Time Stop!

155
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.920
- Counter it, Simon!
- I can't. Sofina's too powerful.

156
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.440
Take the tablet. Keep Kira safe.

157
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.200
You have my word.

158
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.960
The truth is, even if
this council were to sentence me

159
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.680
to another two years
or twenty for that matter

160
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.136
it would never be punishment enough

161
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.520
for the worst crime
I ever committed...

162
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.880
robbing my daughter of her father.

163
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.400
But know that,
if you do choose to free me

164
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.880
I'll spend the rest of my days
trying to right that wrong.

165
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640
Anything you want to add?

166
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200
I'm good.

167
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.440
Before you announce your decision,
I implore you to please wait for...

168
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.000
- Jarnathan!
- Pardon my belatedness.

169
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.680
I can't tell you
how happy I am to see you!

170
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.760
Holga, now!

171
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.080
Guards!

172
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.880
Release me, sir!

173
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.000
She's throwing potatoes!

174
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.400
Oh, Jarnathan!

175
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.600
But we approved your pardon!

176
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.800
Fly, bird, fly!

177
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.680
He's still breathing.

178
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.200
I told you he'd get us out!

179
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.360
Any sign of Kira?

180
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.200
Been empty for a while.

181
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.720
Where do you think Forge took her?

182
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.600
I can't see him leaving
the Sword Coast.

183
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.960
Forge always liked cities.

184
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.320
Some supper for you and your wife?

185
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.880
- What? No. She's not my wife.
- Me with that?

186
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.200
- With those lips?
- That's so gross. Just the drinks.

187
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.120
So, we take a boat down
to Baldur's Gate

188
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.080
and then head north.

189
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.880
And while we're looking for Forge,
I'll pay Marlamin a visit.

190
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.456
You sure you really want
to put yourself through that?

191
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.080
What if he doesn't want
to talk to you?

192
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.400
- It's not about what he wants.
- Okay.

193
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.800
It's about closure.

194
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.256
He sent you a letter saying
he wasn't your husband anymore.

195
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.280
Wasn't that closure?

196
00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.000
- You wouldn't understand.
- I don't.

197
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.920
I clearly, clearly don't.

198
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Is that...

199
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.760
Son of a bitch.

200
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.640
Forge is Lord of Neverwinter.

201
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.080
How did that clown pull that off?

202
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.960
Well, as long as he's got Kira,
I don't care.

203
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.680
Come on. Let's go.

204
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.760
Thanks, pal.
What's wrong with my lips?

205
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.560
- They're too big for your face.
- What?

206
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.480
A lot of people like my lips.

207
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.000
I've never seen
this place so crowded.

208
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.800
Must be coming in
for the High Sun Games.

209
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.040
Yeah, my dad took me to the last one
before they were outlawed.

210
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.480
Anyone win?

211
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.160
Well, one contestant made it
to the final round

212
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.560
before a monster ate
his upper body, so...

213
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960
no.

214
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.680
It's nice to see that Forge
hasn't lost his sense of modesty.

215
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.920
- How long has it been?
- Two years.

216
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.880
No, how long
have we been waiting here?

217
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480
Dad.

218
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
Holga?

219
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760
Kira.

220
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.040
I missed you so much.

221
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:25.200
Hello, Bug.

222
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.520
- Come here.
- Hi.

223
00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.880
I thought about you every day.

224
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.520
I made you these.

225
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
- What are they?
- Mittens!

226
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360
Thanks.

227
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.120
Have you been okay?

228
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Uncle Forge has been very good to me.

229
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.120
"Uncle" Forge?

230
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.360
Come on. He wants to see you.

231
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.360
I still wear the pendant
you got me, Holga.

232
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.800
I use it to sneak
around the castle sometimes.

233
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.160
So strange that you're here.

234
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.400
Hey, Kir, look.

235
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.600
I want you to know I am so sorry
for how things turned out.

236
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920
I took a risk.

237
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.880
And it didn't pay off.

238
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.000
Why do you look mad at me?

239
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.560
Because you're acting like
it wasn't your fault.

240
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.120
There they are!

241
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.600
Old friends.

242
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.240
What a wonderful surprise. Come.

243
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.960
Do I spy a little bit of gray?

244
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120
I do. I like it.

245
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.640
It's scoundrelly but professorial.

246
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.080
You look like a...
What do you look like?

247
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.200
You look like
a well-read fisherman with secrets.

248
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.320
And Holga.

249
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.880
I know you don't like hugs.

250
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.040
But I need one. Yes?

251
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.080
These last years must have been
dreadful, yeah, but I tell you what

252
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.760
I did think you'd serve longer.

253
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.040
Oh, yeah...

254
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:16.000
We... We got an... early release.

255
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.520
- Good behavior.
- Yeah. Behaving, behaving good.

256
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.040
I see.

257
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.040
Well, welcome. Welcome back.

258
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.680
That's blistering.
That's blisteringly hot.

259
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.920
Yet again.

260
00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.056
Kira, we really should speak
to the kitchen staff

261
00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.960
because there's simply no need
for it to be this hot.

262
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.376
Yeah, yeah, the-the tea's hot.

263
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.440
So, how are you
the Lord of Neverwinter?

264
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720
Right.

265
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.880
Before you went off to prison, you
charged me with Kira's well-being.

266
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.680
Didn't think much of it at the time.

267
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.640
But there came a moment
when I looked into her eyes

268
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.120
and I suddenly knew
I had to be a better man.

269
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.416
Obviously, I couldn't give back
the treasures we'd stolen

270
00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:52.800
so when Lord Neverember fell ill

271
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.320
I seized the chance to try and,
you know, make a difference.

272
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.056
And the money from Korinn's Keep
paved the way for my campaign.

273
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.280
But I will tell you this

274
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.400
couldn't have done it alone.

275
00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.760
And here she is!

276
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.480
You remember Sofina.

277
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.136
You're still working with her?

278
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.720
She's the one that got us caught.

279
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.000
Not true, no. Without her,
we all would have been caught.

280
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.880
And since then, she has become...

281
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.200
my top adviser.

282
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.320
The tea is scorching, I do apologize.
It's scorching hot.

283
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Sofina.

284
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.760
Would you mind very much...

285
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.760
Certainly.

286
00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320
Good. Thank you.

287
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.520
I didn't realize you were gonna put
your finger in... in the cup, so...

288
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.120
I'm gonna leave that for later.

289
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.800
Well, if you'll give us the tablet,
Kira, Holga and I will be on our way.

290
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.360
Of course that's why you came back.

291
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.720
No, it wasn't for me.
It was for that Tablet of Riches.

292
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.760
- Riches?
- No, it's...

293
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.240
it's the Tablet of Reawakening.

294
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.560
I'm sorry, what's this now?

295
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.200
The reason why I agreed to the heist.

296
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.040
Is that what he's told you?
That I left you for more riches?

297
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.600
I told her the truth.
She has a right to know it.

298
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.720
He's been lying to you, Kira.

299
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I wanted to...

300
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.720
I wanted to bring your mother back.

301
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.760
Ed, come on. Look, I know
how much you crave her forgiveness

302
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.496
but I promise you,
more lies is not the way.

303
00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.880
You snake!

304
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.200
You know damn well what he was after.

305
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.440
Why wouldn't you tell me
if you were doing it for Mom?

306
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.240
Because I didn't want you
to lose her again if I failed.

307
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.360
But you can't blame the poor girl
for distrusting you.

308
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.120
After all

309
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.560
you have been lying since you set
foot in the room, haven't you?

310
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800
You escaped?

311
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.560
We were trying
to get back to you, Bug.

312
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.600
Kira, look at me, look at me.
I-I swear to you

313
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.560
it was a Tablet of Reawakening.

314
00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.720
I was doing it for Mom,
for all of us. You have to trust me.

315
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.760
You told me to trust you
when you left me.

316
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.160
Kira, no, wait, wait!

317
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.120
- Kira!
- Give her time, give her time.

318
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.120
She's had years to resent you
for your absence.

319
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.400
And you've had years
to poison her against me.

320
00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.920
No, that is not true.

321
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.440
We very rarely spoke of you at all.

322
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.360
Give him what he came for.

323
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.680
The tablet?
I don't think I will be returning it.

324
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.880
Or your daughter, for that matter.

325
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.240
You bastard!

326
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.600
And now you're in the floor!

327
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.640
I hate to see that.

328
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.400
Sofina really is
a very, very powerful wizard!

329
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.856
You'd have thought that
you'd have learned that

330
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.480
the last time she trapped you.

331
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.240
You always wanted us to get caught.

332
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.600
No, I wanted you and Simon
to get caught

333
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.160
but he managed to escape somehow.

334
00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.200
All these years together, and
you double-cross us for this witch?

335
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.520
Never put your trust in a con man.

336
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.640
Save for this...

337
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.960
Kira really is happy
and very well taken care of here,

338
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.080
and I have truly come
to love her as my own.

339
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.960
I never actually saw the appeal
of being a father till I became one.

340
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.440
But to have another person
look up to you

341
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.360
and allow you to shape them
in your own image.

342
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.760
It's a bit like a god!

343
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.720
Well, hang on, I'm a god and a lord.
I am really doing all right!

344
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.920
Blackwood?

345
00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.480
Could you possibly
return them to prison?

346
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.320
And be sure to collect the bounty.

347
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.800
Well, I must away. I am expecting

348
00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.680
two of the wealthiest men
from Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep

349
00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.480
to talk about the High Sun Games,
which are back!

350
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.400
So there's something, isn't it?

351
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.560
It was genuinely lovely
to see you both.

352
00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.000
Holga! Holga! Holga!

353
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.400
Kill both of them.

354
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.696
We got to get her out of there.

355
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720
We will.

356
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.920
But we need to think
of our own hides right now.

357
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.840
Yeah, you got this, right?

358
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.960
I know you don't.

359
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.040
On your knees.

360
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.560
Handsome blade.

361
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.240
Is that the work
of Ghelryn Foehammer?

362
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.280
How did you know?

363
00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.800
The inlay on the haft.

364
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.000
How's the weight? Does it parry?

365
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.800
It's darksteel.

366
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.640
- Very nice.
- Now put your heads down.

367
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240
Wait!

368
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.760
What do you clean it with?

369
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.000
You're about to lose your head.

370
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.040
This is what you're concerned with?

371
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.040
If you wouldn't mind.

372
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.680
Boiled linseed oil. Once a month.

373
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.000
Should be once a week.

374
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.720
That's why
you're getting rust on the bit.

375
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.120
Okay, chop it off.

376
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.280
Chop it off, let's do it.

377
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.440
Get her!

378
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.760
Stop her!

379
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.880
We got 'em now!

380
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.360
- Before we leave the city...
- Get boiled linseed oil, I know.

381
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040
Knock, knock.

382
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.640
I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

383
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.880
I knew I'd see him again one day.

384
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.000
I just hoped it would be different.

385
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.480
Well, you have to understand that

386
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.120
when he lost your mother

387
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.760
he sort of lost himself.

388
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.560
Why did he lie about the tablet?

389
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.120
Maybe he was ashamed to admit
how much he'd given up for so little.

390
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.400
I should probably go speak to him.

391
00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280
What?

392
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.360
Well, he's gone, my dear. He's gone.

393
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.200
I gave him
the Tablet of Riches and...

394
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760
he left.

395
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.440
Holga, too?

396
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.520
I'm sorry.

397
00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.680
And I want you to know
that even if he isn't there for you

398
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.200
I always will be.

399
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840
I know.

400
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.800
The fact that you see good in me

401
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.000
makes me believe that
there might just be some in there.

402
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.400
We could shoot an arrow
with a message into her room.

403
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.200
What if it hits her?

404
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.880
That's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

405
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.200
Killing my daughter with an arrow?

406
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.800
No, it's not.

407
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.280
Even if she got the message,
she wouldn't come. She thinks of...

408
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.760
Forge as her dad.

409
00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.000
We have to get into that castle
and take her out ourselves.

410
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.320
That's crazy, Ed.

411
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.200
Castle Never's tighter
than Korinn's Keep

412
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.760
and you know what happened with that.

413
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.640
We're gonna need a team.

414
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.280
Team? Who's gonna help us out?
We have nothing to pay them with.

415
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.120
Yeah, but Forge does.

416
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.056
He said the richest people were
coming to bet on the High Sun Games.

417
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.496
There'll be a fortune in that vault.

418
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.000
Yeah. Not to mention the tablet.

419
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.880
And then Kira will know that...

420
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.000
We abandoned her
for the right reason.

421
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.000
I wouldn't put it like that,
but... yeah. Yeah.

422
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.360
Who do we get for this team?

423
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.920
You know, I wonder
if Simon's still in Triboar.

424
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.680
Simon's a terrible sorcerer.

425
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.680
We haven't seen him in two years.
I'm sure he's gotten better.

426
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.800
No one can hold a candle
to this trick.

427
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.200
How about this one? You people like
the smell of fresh-cut grass?

428
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.680
Smell that? It's fresh-cut grass.

429
00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.760
My five-year-old can do that magic.

430
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.120
But can he do this?

431
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280
Boo.

432
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.960
He hasn't gotten better.

433
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.160
I don't think it's about
what he's doing up there.

434
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.320
This is quite hard to be
slightly blurry like this, you know.

435
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.840
Anyone can be very blurry,
but to be slightly blurry

436
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.360
that's the real magic.

437
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880
Is that...

438
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.200
- What was that?
- Where?

439
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.320
Hey!

440
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.320
He's nickin' our bits and bobs!

441
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.760
That's... It's not what you think.
It's all part of the act.

442
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.920
He's lying.

443
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.440
Get him!

444
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680
Get him!

445
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.280
Shield spell!

446
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.520
Shield spell!

447
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.120
That wasn't a shield spell.

448
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.280
I am not loving this show.

449
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.000
You're a dead man!

450
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.560
<i>Obscrus mo...</i>

451
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320
<i>moyfin!</i>

452
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.600
<i>Moyfin!</i> Damn!

453
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.880
<i>Obscrus moyfin!</i>

454
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.960
- Simon?
- Holga!

455
00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040
Staying for an encore?

456
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.200
Get me out of here.

457
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.840
I could've warned you
Forge was a prick.

458
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.896
Soon as we left that vault,
Sofina tried to kill me

459
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.120
and he just stood by.

460
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.960
You know, there's rumors
she made Lord Neverember fall ill

461
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.400
to clear the way for Forge.

462
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.360
Her magic is on a whole other level.

463
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.640
Don't sell yourself short.
We saw your show.

464
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.400
Yeah, you can hit her
with that fresh-cut grass trick.

465
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640
That's funny.

466
00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.040
Look, I don't blame you
for wanting to save Kira

467
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.480
and I love the idea
of knocking Forge off his perch

468
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.000
but robbing Castle Never
isn't worth the risk.

469
00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.600
And robbing your audience is?

470
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.520
How broke are you?

471
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.760
Desperately.

472
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.736
I was planning
on sleeping in the theater tonight

473
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.040
but now that seems imprudent.

474
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240
So?

475
00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.400
Do we even know what sort of
arcane magic is protecting the vault?

476
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.800
- We're gonna find out!
- How?

477
00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.456
You gonna sneak past
the entire Castle Watch?

478
00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480
Me? No.

479
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.680
A druid maybe, a Wild Shape.

480
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.160
They could get in and out
undetected as a...

481
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.160
- as a mouse or a...
- A deer.

482
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.400
Yes, a deer! It'll blend in with
all the other deer in the castle.

483
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600
Don't mock me.

484
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.600
Where can we find a druid?

485
00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.920
I know a druid. Doric.

486
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.920
She's truly one of a kind.

487
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.360
Sounds romantic in nature.

488
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.880
Yeah. For me it was.

489
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.400
She, however, found my lack
of self-esteem unattractive.

490
00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.680
Not your best trait.

491
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.160
Thank you.

492
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.360
In the name of Forge Fitzwilliam

493
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.560
the prisoner is hereby sentenced
to death by dismemberment

494
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.680
for the crime
of speaking ill of our leader.

495
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.320
The Emerald Enclave
will never relent!

496
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.160
Justice cannot be killed!

497
00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.560
On my command.

498
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.680
- Your Doric's a bit of a radical.
- Ready?

499
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.200
Oh, no, that's not Doric.

500
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.360
Move in! Kill her!

501
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.800
Move in!

502
00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.360
Move in!

503
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.280
That's her.

504
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.360
- What is that again?
- It's an owlbear.

505
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.320
<i>Mlor fol satu.</i>

506
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.280
- <i>Silesna.</i>
- How high is this place?

507
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.400
It's just up here.

508
00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.400
- Stay where you are!
- Wait! Wait! It's me!

509
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.400
- Simon.
- Simon who?

510
00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.480
Ouch.

511
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.520
Simon Aumar.

512
00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.640
Sorcerer.

513
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.640
I courted you.

514
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.960
You said I made you feel sad.

515
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:06.920
Not from anything I did,
just from who I was.

516
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

517
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680
What are you doing here?

518
00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.760
- We need a deer.
- We don't need a deer.

519
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.000
We're gonna take down
Forge Fitzwilliam.

520
00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.640
So, how'd you come to live here?

521
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:28.120
I was born to humans who decided
they didn't want a tiefling child.

522
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.200
The wood elves took me in.

523
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.240
I joined the Emerald Enclave
to protect them.

524
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.000
See, that's all the more reason
to join us.

525
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.520
You're the only one
who can get into that castle unseen

526
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.120
and tell us what we're dealing with.

527
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.640
As you can imagine,
I don't trust humans.

528
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.560
I find you to be hateful and selfish.

529
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.000
Well, I'm finding you
to be a little mean.

530
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.000
If it helps, I'm only half-human.

531
00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.360
But you're a bad sorcerer.

532
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.600
No, Simon... He's a mighty sorcerer!

533
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.120
He's a descendant of Elminster Aumar.

534
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.520
The only way to succeed in this is to
have confidence that it can be done.

535
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:00.520
- He doesn't.
- Yeah, I suppose that's fair.

536
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:04.480
Look, Simon may not have my wit
or Holga's strength

537
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.560
but when it counts,
this young man delivers.

538
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.640
It's why I chose him.

539
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.680
He's also the only sorcerer you know.

540
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.760
Holga, not helpful.

541
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.600
What is it exactly
that you bring to this?

542
00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.400
Me? I'm a planner. You know?

543
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880
I make plans.

544
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.160
You've already made the plan,
so what value do you have now?

545
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.880
If the plan fails...
the existing plan...

546
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.160
I make a new plan.

547
00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.200
So you make plans that fail.

548
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.600
- No.
- He also plays the lute.

549
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.200
Holga, not relevant.
Trust me, I'm indispensable.

550
00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.880
Well...

551
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.840
none of the plans we've tried
to take down Forge have worked.

552
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.480
We dared to question
how he came to power

553
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.560
so he declared us enemies.

554
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.560
Began destroying our homes

555
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.200
and executing our people.

556
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.920
If we don't stop Forge soon

557
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:58.520
there'll be nothing left to defend.

558
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.240
I'm not doing this for the money.

559
00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.520
I'm doing this for the people who
took me in when no one else would.

560
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.240
So we'll keep your share then.

561
00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760
Szass Tam.

562
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.520
But you have always been
the disciple I rely on most.

563
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.520
Doff your cowl.

564
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.480
You needn't hide your sigils from me.

565
00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.760
I'd rather be flensed and flayed

566
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.600
than spend another hour
with Forge Fitzwilliam.

567
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.360
The man is insufferable.

568
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.520
But we never would have come this far
without his "charm."

569
00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.640
The living have befouled
this world long enough.

570
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.120
Take solace in knowing that
your work here is nearly complete.

571
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.160
There you are!

572
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.680
With your hood off, I notice.

573
00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.000
Probably best to keep that on.

574
00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.000
You know, you Red Wizards of Thay

575
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.520
are not as popular
as you should be outside Thay.

576
00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.160
And of course, you're about
to be considerably less popular.

577
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.480
But far, far be it from me
ever to tell you what to do.

578
00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:25.880
Caldwell and Piradost have arrived.
I was gonna give them...

579
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.360
Awful, isn't it? I really have to do
something about these chairs.

580
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680
They're...

581
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.720
Now, I think you will find that we
have taken every imaginable measure

582
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.240
to protect the assets that
you may or may not choose to wager

583
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.680
during the High Sun Games.

584
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.960
We have new portcullises
on every wing of the castle.

585
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.400
If the alarm is raised,
nobody gets in or out.

586
00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.880
And then there is...

587
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.800
the vault itself.

588
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.320
My chief adviser, Sofina,
can give you all the details.

589
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.360
It is protected by
the Arcane Seal of Mordenkainen.

590
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.800
Well...

591
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.480
perhaps not all the details, but...

592
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.960
suffice to say
it is a seriously powerful spell.

593
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.600
Might I inquire, what prompted you
to resume the games?

594
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.960
Lord Neverember considered them
quite brutal.

595
00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.000
Lord Neverember and I
are very different men.

596
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.800
For example, I prefer
to be up and about.

597
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.800
He prefers to be
in a vegetative state.

598
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.120
You are terrible.

599
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.480
I can be naughty.

600
00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.080
The truth is that the games bring
the city together like nothing else.

601
00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:46.200
And it is not the role of government
to deny the people what they crave.

602
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:50.720
Or to deny you rich bastards
the right to profit off them.

603
00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.000
Now who wants refreshments?

604
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.120
Silence!

605
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:01.560
A Wild Shape is among us.

606
00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.160
Hey!

607
00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:31.560
Stop!

608
00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.800
I can't grab her!

609
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.120
So she did become a deer.

610
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.400
Only at the very end.

611
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.600
Are you absolutely sure about Sofina?

612
00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.720
I saw her markings.

613
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.560
No wonder I couldn't
counter her Time Stop.

614
00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.680
Forge knew all along.

615
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.576
He's got my daughter in there
with a Red Wizard.

616
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.920
The vault is protected by something
called "Morty Kamen's Arcane Seal."

617
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.240
- Mordenkainen?
- Yeah, that's it.

618
00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.280
- Oh, pity.
- What?

619
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.696
If the vault has Mordenkainen's Seal,
we're not getting in.

620
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.960
- It's impenetrable.
- Can't you just open it with magic?

621
00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.640
Okay, here we go.

622
00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:00.120
I hate how everyone thinks that
you can solve any problem with magic.

623
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.120
There are limits.
This isn't some bedtime story.

624
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.520
This is the real world.

625
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.000
So there's no way to open it?

626
00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.000
I mean, if I were one of the world's
most powerful sorcerers, so, no.

627
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:11.760
Or if we had the Helm of Disjunction.

628
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.560
The what?

629
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.760
It's a helmet that disables
all nearby enchantments.

630
00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:16.880
But it doesn't matter.

631
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.680
The thing went missing ages ago.
We're done.

632
00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:20.360
Come on.

633
00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.760
What's the problem?
We can find that helmet.

634
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.120
Even if we did, I couldn't use it
without attuning to it

635
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200
which I'm terrible at.

636
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.600
You can do it. I know you can.

637
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.200
You saying that doesn't make it so.

638
00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.600
Yeah, but you saying it does.

639
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.960
- But I can't.
- But you can.

640
00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.320
- But I won't.
- Just say it.

641
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.400
- No!
- Fine.

642
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.736
Can we just keep this between us?

643
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.320
I don't want to hurt
the group's morale.

644
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.840
What morale?

645
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.880
Holga knows where the helmet is.

646
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.280
- You do?
- My tribe

647
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.760
fought the Cult of the Dragon
over it at the Evermoors.

648
00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.176
We could just ask them where it went.

649
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.840
That battle was a century ago.
They're all dead.

650
00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.440
So? Ask them with magic.

651
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.320
He just made a whole speech how
he can't fix everything with magic.

652
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.920
Actually, that is something I can do.

653
00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.520
You can bring back the dead?

654
00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.520
I can't bring them back

655
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:04.400
but I have this token that lets me
ask corpses some questions

656
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.920
then they go back to being dead.

657
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.080
- Yuck.
- Yeah, it's fairly horrible.

658
00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.000
It's fairly wonderful.

659
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:13.360
We're off to the Evermoors.
Thank you, Simon, for the drinks.

660
00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.280
What? No...

661
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.880
Just pay it with magic.

662
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.360
He's a Thayan!

663
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.440
Hey, Ed.

664
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200
Look where we are.

665
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.720
Marlamin? Really?

666
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.360
Why would you do that to yourself?

667
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.680
I'm just gonna pick up
some of my things.

668
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.600
He painted the shutters.

669
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480
Pretty.

670
00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.720
Holga!

671
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.160
Hello, Marlamin.

672
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.520
- That's Marlamin?
- Yeah.

673
00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.560
We were all a little surprised
the first time we met him.

674
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.520
I thought your sentence was longer.

675
00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.520
I busted out of there.

676
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.800
Same old Holga.

677
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:09.680
So what have you been up to?

678
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.000
The usual.

679
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.680
I've got my garden.
I'm working on my book.

680
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.480
I see you still have
that walking stick I gave you.

681
00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.960
Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040
Well, you can take it with you
if you want.

683
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.080
- Gwinn's not much for rambling.
- Gwinn?

684
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.720
- You home, darling?
- In here.

685
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.920
Squashed a pack of bullywugs
down at the...

686
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:31.360
Hello.

687
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.080
- Who's this, then?
- Gwinn, this is Holga.

688
00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.040
Heard a lot about you.

689
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.200
I'd shake your hand, but...

690
00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720
Pleasure.

691
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.040
How long you in town for?

692
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.000
Just passing through.

693
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.480
Gonna talk to some corpses
south of Nesmé.

694
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.680
Great, yeah.

695
00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.840
Gonna get washed up for supper.

696
00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080
What we having?

697
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.240
I cured a goose
and I gathered some pickleberries.

698
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.560
Nice meeting you, Holga.

699
00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.480
So how long have you two...

700
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560
Going on a year.

701
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.040
Does she make you happy?

702
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.960
Happier than I did?

703
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.080
I'll put it this way:
She makes her living honestly.

704
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.360
She doesn't drink herself silly.

705
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.320
And she doesn't make me weep
in the small hours

706
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.680
wondering where she is.

707
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.720
I was in pain.

708
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.440
I was banished from my damn tribe
to be with you.

709
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.160
And I tried to build us a home
so you could forget that.

710
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.040
But you never could.

711
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.520
Gwinn seems lovely.

712
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.040
You deserve that.

713
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.640
Thank you.

714
00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:43.800
You know, when you left,
I lost my family.

715
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.320
I've been fortunate enough
to find another.

716
00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.720
And I wish nothing
less than that for you.

717
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:58.160
My sweet, old Ho-Ho.

718
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.920
We're gonna take down Forge.

719
00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.280
I'm gonna show
Marlamin and the Elk tribe

720
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.880
they were fools to let me go.

721
00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.120
<i>Not fortune found, nor fate divine</i>

722
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.320
<i>Come close to toping
the juice of the vine</i>

723
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.600
<i>With cherry crew, we sip and sway</i>

724
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.040
<i>Let's tip the tankard
and waste the day</i>

725
00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.480
<i>- Ree-raw! Well, ye ken
- Ree-raw! Well, ye ken</i>

726
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.120
<i>- Our toils can wait for a time
- Our toils can wait for a time</i>

727
00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.600
<i>- We saw the folly of men
- We saw the folly of men</i>

728
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.360
<i>- Who rather than revel repine
- Who rather than revel repine</i>

729
00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.160
<i>- Ree-raw! Well, ye ken
- Ree-raw! Well, ye ken</i>

730
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.120
<i>- Our toils can wait for a time
- Our toils can wait for a time</i>

731
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.960
<i>- We saw the folly of men
- We saw the folly of men</i>

732
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.880
<i>- Who rather than revel repine
- Who rather than revel repine</i>

733
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.760
So many of my kin
gave their lives in battle here.

734
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.920
I'd always imagined I'd be buried
in sacred ground like this.

735
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:45.440
Yeah.

736
00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:47.200
Anyone got a shovel?

737
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.760
Okay, Simon, how does this work?

738
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.040
I read the incantation
on this cleric's token.

739
00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.040
Should be here somewhere. Here!

740
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.280
All right.
Once the dead man is revived

741
00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.880
we can ask him five questions

742
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.800
at which point he will die again,
never to be re-revived.

743
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.040
Why five questions?

744
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.640
I don't know,
that's just how it works.

745
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.880
- Seems arbitrary.
- Can we get on with this, please?

746
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.040
Right, yes.

747
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.200
Delightful.

748
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.560
<i>Perlamon tergatys.</i>

749
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.600
Maybe I'm not saying it right.

750
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.400
I wasn't scared, merely startled.

751
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.360
Here we go.

752
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.640
Were you killed
in the Battle of the Evermoors?

753
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:51.360
- Yes.
- Great!

754
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:55.600
I mean, not for you.
Sorry for your loss.

755
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.120
- Four more questions, right?
- Yes.

756
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.200
No, no, that wasn't for you.

757
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.560
Did that count as a question?

758
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:02.640
Yes.

759
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:03.720
Damn it.

760
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.320
Only answer when I talk to you

761
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.600
- okay?
- Yes.

762
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.520
Why did you say "okay?"
at the end of that?

763
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.640
I didn't.

764
00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.600
Fantastic. Where's the shovel?

765
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:16.920
<i>Perlamon tergatys.</i>

766
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.160
Toke Horgath.

767
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.880
During the battle, did you see
the Helmet of Disjunction?

768
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.320
It was in possession of my chief,
Stanhard Grimwulf.

769
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560
Okay, good.

770
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.880
And what did
Stanhard Grimwulf do with it?

771
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:41.320
<i>As the cultists breached the ridge,
we knew we outnumbered them.</i>

772
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.680
<i>But our advantage meant nothing
against the dragon Rakor.</i>

773
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.880
Horgath!

774
00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640
Horgath!

775
00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.680
Take this and run.

776
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.360
Keep it from Rakor at all costs!

777
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.280
Understood, sir. Don't worry.

778
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.560
That's the last thing I remember.

779
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.000
Yeah, well...

780
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.680
Thanks for your help.

781
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.040
Let's go look
for Stanhard Grimwulf's grave.

782
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.280
Hang on! Hang on!

783
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.640
Aren't you going to ask him
the last three questions?

784
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.576
Ask him what? He already
told us everything he knows.

785
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.160
Well, you can't just leave him
like that. Look at the poor bloke.

786
00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.640
Fine.

787
00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.400
What's your favorite food?

788
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.120
Oats. No, barley!

789
00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:35.440
Oh, boy.

790
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.800
Do you like cats?

791
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160
Not really.

792
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.440
Okay.

793
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.920
What's two plus two?

794
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.120
I'm bad at math.

795
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.360
- Don't you feel better?
- No.

796
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.640
Oftentimes, the most onerous decision
a leader can take

797
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.200
is when to retreat.

798
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.800
I issued the order.

799
00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.880
<i>I commanded my battle lord
to deliver the helmet</i>

800
00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.200
<i>to our swiftest rider, Ven Salafin.</i>

801
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.360
If we can just make it
over the ridge, we can...

802
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Not again.

803
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.800
It was the morning of the battle.

804
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.680
As I stepped out my bath,
my foot slipped on the stone.

805
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.520
And then you went into the battle?

806
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.880
No. I died. From the fall.

807
00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.840
But Stanhard Grimwulf said
he gave the helmet to Ven Salafin.

808
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:29.920
That's you, isn't it?

809
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.120
I'm Sven Salafin. Ven's my brother.

810
00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.920
This is a nightmare.

811
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.600
Is Ven all right?

812
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.360
I was wounded and had lost my horse
as I escaped the field of battle.

813
00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.520
<i>I didn't care about myself.</i>

814
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.920
<i>I just needed
to keep the helmet safe.</i>

815
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.680
<i>It was a Thayan,
who bore the mark of Szass Tam.</i>

816
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.560
<i>I waited for the killing blow.</i>

817
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.640
<i>But it never came.</i>

818
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.240
<i>He had a kind way.</i>

819
00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.280
<i>He told me his name was Xenk Yendar.</i>

820
00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.160
<i>He had fled Szass Tam
and now lived in exile.</i>

821
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.760
<i>As I died, he promised
to keep the helmet safe.</i>

822
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.320
And for some reason, I believed him.

823
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.640
You're joking. A "kind" Thayan?

824
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.760
I speak truth.

825
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.000
You speak horseshit.

826
00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.160
That Thayan lied
and you died for nothing.

827
00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:33.336
The helmet's a dead end, we'll have
to find another way into the vault.

828
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.680
No, I've heard of Xenk.

829
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.760
He's a paladin. He helped the Enclave
defeat the Clerics of Talos.

830
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.400
I know the name as well. My uncle
said Xenk fended off a Beholder

831
00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.160
using only a sharpened gourd.

832
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:43.720
A sharpened gourd?

833
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.920
Something sharp.

834
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.960
The Thayans are murderers.
End of story.

835
00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960
What?

836
00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.520
- I've heard of him, too.
- No.

837
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:54.520
He fought with my cousin
in the Anauroch.

838
00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.640
He says he's a good man.

839
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.440
Well, you can all go find this lovely
Xenk and braid each other's hair.

840
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.800
I'll find another way.

841
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.120
What's his problem?

842
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.880
He's got a history with the Thayans.

843
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.000
I know how you're feeling.
But we're running out of time.

844
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.120
I'd be betraying Zia.

845
00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.880
No, you wouldn't. You'd be
doing it to save her and Kira.

846
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.600
Look, if Xenk turns out to be a prick

847
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.360
I'll split him
right down the middle.

848
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.240
That's very sweet.

849
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.640
What have we got to lose?

850
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.080
Anyone know where stupid Xenk is?

851
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.320
Last I heard, he was working with
the Harpers in Mornbryn's Shield.

852
00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.200
Great! Harpers.

853
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.760
What's his problem with Harpers?

854
00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:39.480
He's got a history with them too.

855
00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.680
All right, let's go.

856
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.920
Excuse me?

857
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.640
I'm still alive.

858
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720
Right.

859
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.880
What's your favorite book?

860
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.000
Hard to pick just one.

861
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.456
- Fifth question, right?
- Yep.

862
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.360
In terms of historical works, I'd say

863
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:00.240
<i>The Fanged Tome of Lykanthus Szar.</i>

864
00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.400
That was only the fourth question.

865
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:05.360
Hello?

866
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:07.760
Oh, shit.

867
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.520
Heave! Heave!

868
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.160
Come on, we need more! Come on!

869
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:48.240
It's alive!

870
00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600
Thank you!

871
00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:04.760
He's interesting.

872
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.160
I've seen more interesting.

873
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.240
Ed, go talk to him.

874
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.320
You go talk to him.

875
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.960
You know,
I've pulled cats out of fish.

876
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:19.320
Xenk, is it?

877
00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.536
That is a query
I prefer not to answer

878
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:24.120
without knowing
to whom I am speaking.

879
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.720
I'm Holga Kilgore.

880
00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.680
This is Simon, Edgin
and Doric back there.

881
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.576
And what brings you
to Mornbryn's Shield?

882
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600
You do.

883
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.240
We're trying to find
the Helmet of Dysfunction.

884
00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.360
Disjunction.

885
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.840
Many lives were lost
in defense of that helm.

886
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.280
To speak of it would be
to diminish their sacrifice.

887
00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.120
<i>Janklee.</i>

888
00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.560
<i>Janklee</i> to you as well, good sir.

889
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.440
You're known as a man
of honor and integrity

890
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.760
and I can assure you

891
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.600
our reasons for wanting the helmet
are entirely noble.

892
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:02.160
Yep. We're gonna rob someone.

893
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.240
Holga!

894
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.160
Not just anyone. Forge Fitzwilliam.

895
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.320
And the Red Wizard of Thay
he's partnered with.

896
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360
Come with me.

897
00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.520
What is this place?

898
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.320
A Harper sanctuary.

899
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.280
But surely your friend Edgin
already knew that.

900
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.280
How'd you know I was a Harper?

901
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.440
You may have forsworn your oath

902
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.560
but your oath hasn't forsworn you.

903
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.376
Just because
that sentence is symmetrical

904
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:34.800
doesn't make it not nonsense.

905
00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.520
Why do you wish to rob Fitzwilliam?

906
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.400
He stole Edgin's daughter
and a great deal of treasure from us.

907
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.800
Also a Tablet of Reawakening.

908
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:42.200
He doesn't need to know all that.

909
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.320
- I was just...
- In other words

910
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.000
Forge is a real son of a bitch.

911
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.080
So you blame his mother
for his corruption.

912
00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.320
What?

913
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.120
No, it's an expression.

914
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.480
I see.

915
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.800
I do not traffic in colloquialisms.

916
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.480
You're not a lot of fun, are you?

917
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.880
If Fitzwilliam is truly allied
with a Red Wizard

918
00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.640
their intentions must go
beyond the mere political.

919
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.720
Over a century ago,
the necromancer Szass Tam

920
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.440
was one of eight zulkirs
who ruled the nation of Thay.

921
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:09.920
Great, a history lesson.

922
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.960
But Tam's hunger for power
was absolute.

923
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.120
On the eve of the solstice

924
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.120
<i>the residents of the capital
gathered for a celebration.</i>

925
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.760
<i>Unbeknownst to them,
or his fellow rulers</i>

926
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.920
<i>Tam had a plan of his own:</i>

927
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.960
<i>to stage an unholy coup.</i>

928
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.520
<i>He unleashed the Beckoning Death</i>

929
00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.120
<i>a spell that would consume
the souls of all who beheld it</i>

930
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:05.160
<i>enslaving them to his will.</i>

931
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.840
<i>With the aid of his Red Wizards</i>

932
00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.840
<i>Szass Tam created
an army of the undead</i>

933
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.000
<i>allowing him to conquer
the entire nation.</i>

934
00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:20.000
Szass's power extends no further
than the borders of Thay.

935
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.440
I suspect he and his Red Wizards
will not be content

936
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.280
until they have infected the whole
of Faerûn with their maleficence.

937
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.120
You done? Because we already know
that Red Wizards are bad.

938
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.200
And so does Forge.
The question remains

939
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.760
if they helped him to take power,
what do they stand to gain?

940
00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.520
Sounds like we have a common enemy.

941
00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.600
You give us that helmet,
and we take Forge down.

942
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.776
No one stays Lord without a fortune
to back him up.

943
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.520
And the Red Wizards
lose their puppet.

944
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.720
What will become of
the wealth you burgle?

945
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.240
What does that matter?

946
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:47.120
I will not be complicit in
the illicit use of ill-gotten booty.

947
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.400
Fine. We'll divide it
amongst the townspeople.

948
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.200
- Swear to it.
- What?

949
00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:55.320
Place your hand on this Harper's Seal

950
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.680
and swear that you will indeed
distribute all the wealth you take

951
00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.560
amongst the people of Neverwinter.

952
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:01.880
Sure, fine.

953
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:07.680
Go on, Ed.

954
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.560
Promise you'll give Forge's money
to the people.

955
00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.080
I promise I'll...

956
00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.000
give Forge's money
to the people of Neverwinter.

957
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.760
Keep this.

958
00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:26.240
You may not yet believe
your words, but I do.

959
00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.400
Yeah. Good for you.
Simon, hold onto this.

960
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.320
Now, where's the helmet?

961
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.720
In the bowels of the Underdark.

962
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.800
The Underdark?

963
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:36.736
Weren't you trying to keep it safe?
Why would you put it down there?

964
00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:37.816
Because it is the last place

965
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.456
that anyone who
values their life would go.

966
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.120
- Sounds lovely.
- Quite the opposite.

967
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.920
I know. I was being ironic.

968
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.400
I find irony is a blade that cuts
he who wields it most especially.

969
00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.320
Yeah? Is that what you find, Xenk?

970
00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:52.976
There is an entrance east
of the Sword Mountains

971
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.240
in the Kryptgarden Forest

972
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.760
from which we may descend
to the ruins of Dolblunde.

973
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:01.960
If I may be so bold, what caused you
to renounce the Harpers?

974
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.800
Being a Harper got my wife killed.

975
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.280
I'm sorry.

976
01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.960
Did her assailants find justice?

977
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.680
The Thayans, you mean?

978
01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.200
No.

979
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.120
The Thayans are not all malevolent.

980
01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:21.080
I was a boy when Szass Tam
seized control of Thay.

981
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.200
<i>I saw firsthand
the horrors of the spell.</i>

982
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.640
<i>Honorable men turned to monsters.</i>

983
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.480
<i>Minds wiped clean in moments.</i>

984
01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.640
<i>Parents turning on their own child.</i>

985
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.480
<i>I escaped, alive</i>

986
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.880
but forever changed.

987
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.560
You and I have both lost
a part of ourselves.

988
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.880
All that matters is
what we do with what remains.

989
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.096
I told you what I'm gonna do.

990
01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.520
I'm gonna break into Castle Never
and get my family back.

991
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.240
And the tablet?

992
01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.560
- You plan to resurrect your wife.
- Yeah.

993
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680
Very well.

994
01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.640
I'd only ask that you consider

995
01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.800
that this plane we call "life"
is but one of many.

996
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.080
To drag your lady-love
back to her old life

997
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.800
is to deprive her of her new one.

998
01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.160
Can someone else
ride next to this guy?

999
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.400
Follow me to the orifice.

1000
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.720
The orifice?

1001
01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.760
The Underdark has many entrances.

1002
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.680
This is one of the less conspicuous.

1003
01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.400
I'll go last.

1004
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.560
It's a day's trek.

1005
01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.640
I've chosen a path
to avoid the populace.

1006
01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.560
Stay close and quiet.

1007
01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.680
Whatever you've heard of this place

1008
01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.040
is merely a fraction
of its true danger.

1009
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.200
Should the way become too dim

1010
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.360
you may take my hand,
and I will lead you.

1011
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.680
I'll tell you right now,
I'm not taking his hand.

1012
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.360
Keep your guard up.
I don't trust this guy.

1013
01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:42.920
Even though he's helping us?

1014
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.000
He's got something up his sleeve.

1015
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.200
The only thing up my sleeve
is my arm.

1016
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.600
How could he hear that?

1017
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.000
I hear that as well.

1018
01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:52.880
I hate you.

1019
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.320
The path to the ruins is just here.

1020
01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:17.640
Keep still!

1021
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.000
Rochnon.

1022
01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.800
Intellect devourers.
Small but formidable.

1023
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.240
They stun their targets
and consume the brain

1024
01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.840
taking control of the body.

1025
01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.640
- What do we do?
- Make no sound.

1026
01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.560
They're drawn to mental energy.

1027
01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.200
The higher
the intelligence of the prey

1028
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.400
the more likely they are to strike.

1029
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.120
Well, that's a little hurtful.

1030
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.880
There it is.
The Hanging City of Dolblunde.

1031
01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:05.000
The helmet lies
on the far side of this chasm.

1032
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:10.200
But be warned, the bridge is
protected by an ancient Gnomish trap.

1033
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.320
There is a precise formula
we must follow

1034
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.800
so as not to trigger the mechanism.

1035
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:14.960
What's the formula?

1036
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.120
It's quite simple.

1037
01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.080
Starting from the center,
use odd-numbered blocks only

1038
01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.441
moving forward with each step,
except for every fifth step

1039
01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.680
which must be a lateral move.

1040
01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.320
Left or right, it matters not

1041
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.640
so long as the leader
and the laggard remain equidistant.

1042
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.600
After which, proceed.
Again, odd-numbered blocks only.

1043
01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.560
However, at the midpoint
we switch to even-numbered blocks.

1044
01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.400
Same pattern, except now
a lateral move after the fourth step

1045
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.560
until we reach the three...

1046
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400
I may have...

1047
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.680
put my foot on the bridge.

1048
01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320
Didn't realize that's where
it technically started.

1049
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.160
So... sorry.

1050
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.920
It's not very structurally sound.

1051
01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.040
Can't you just magic us across?

1052
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.520
It's too far for telekinesis.

1053
01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.400
I've got some rope in my bag.

1054
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.960
I could tie it to the axe.

1055
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.280
Toss it across
so it sticks to the rock.

1056
01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.080
You know rocks are hard, right?

1057
01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.200
Shut up.

1058
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.880
Where did you get that?

1059
01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.840
What, Marlamin's walking stick?

1060
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.160
I swiped it from a wizard
over in the Greypeaks.

1061
01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.880
That's not a walking stick.

1062
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.960
- It's a Hither-Thither staff.
- A what?

1063
01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.960
Should have a range
of around 500 yards.

1064
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:40.400
Watch.

1065
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.640
Hither.

1066
01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800
Thither.

1067
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.120
It works!

1068
01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.680
See?

1069
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.480
Didn't even need the bridge!

1070
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.840
I did good.

1071
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.040
Good save.

1072
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.440
This I give you now

1073
01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.520
trusting that you will
protect it with your very life.

1074
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.320
I will.

1075
01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.880
Hold this.

1076
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.200
There is evil here.

1077
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.040
Are those...

1078
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.240
Thayan assassins.

1079
01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.360
Leave them to me.

1080
01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.360
<i>Cothin al nepeai!</i>

1081
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.400
I'm glad he's on our side.

1082
01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:02.320
We must flee.

1083
01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.720
Why? You killed them all.

1084
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.240
'Tis no simple feat to kill that
which is already dead.

1085
01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.640
Quickly!

1086
01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:05.360
That's one pudgy dragon.

1087
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.600
It's Themberchaud.
He must have found a new den.

1088
01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.920
Did he eat the last one?

1089
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.120
I got you!

1090
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.200
It's a dead end!

1091
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:39.880
Simon! Up there!

1092
01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.160
Thanks for that.

1093
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.800
You'd have done the same for me.

1094
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.640
Yeah.

1095
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.520
Bastard won't quit!

1096
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.920
Come on! He's stuck!

1097
01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200
So are we.

1098
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.760
We're gonna drown!

1099
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.560
Well, portal us out of here!

1100
01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.320
I can only portal us
to what I can see!

1101
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.080
You want to go
from that wall to that wall?

1102
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.360
It's salt water.

1103
01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.960
Simon, you remember that trick
you did in Triboar?

1104
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.200
Fresh-cut grass smell?

1105
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:17.440
No, the flame finger one.

1106
01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.240
- Yeah, why?
- Holga, hit him!

1107
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.920
You want to make him angrier?

1108
01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.640
When I say so,
everybody goes underwater.

1109
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.760
And that'll be your cue,
Simon, all right?

1110
01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.960
What are you looking at?

1111
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.880
A Harper shaking off his slumber.

1112
01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.160
Go, Holga!

1113
01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:38.760
Again!

1114
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.960
Now!

1115
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.080
This is where I leave you.

1116
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.400
I wish you every success
on your journey.

1117
01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:27.680
- You're not coming?
- Would that I could.

1118
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.200
But this is your quest.

1119
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.480
I have given you the tools.
You must utilize them.

1120
01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.200
Can't you utilize them for us?

1121
01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.840
Because you're much better
at fighting and strategy and...

1122
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.200
Pretty much everything but talking.

1123
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.080
Talking to you isn't great.

1124
01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.080
In those instances where
faith wanes and doubt waxes

1125
01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.576
I recall
the Tenets of the Ancients...

1126
01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.440
Okay. See you later.

1127
01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.400
There he goes.

1128
01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.280
Just wandering off.

1129
01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.800
Walks in such a straight line.

1130
01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.000
Wait a minute.
He's coming up on a rock.

1131
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.000
Is he gonna go around?

1132
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360
Nope.

1133
01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:24.200
Right over the rock.

1134
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.640
What are you mumbling?

1135
01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.440
I'm preparing to attune.

1136
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:37.880
If I can't connect with it,
it'll be useless.

1137
01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:42.080
That's a lot of pressure,
given all we went through to get it.

1138
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.360
Yeah, I realize that.

1139
01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760
So our entire fate rests on you.

1140
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.520
Come on.

1141
01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.680
There he is, the great Simon Aumar.

1142
01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:19.000
Sorcerer descended
from wizarding blood.

1143
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.360
Who are you?

1144
01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.160
Don't you know me?

1145
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.640
My name is Aumar too.

1146
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.120
You're my great-great grandfather.

1147
01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.320
That's quite a helm.

1148
01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:37.120
What makes you think
you're worthy of it?

1149
01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:39.880
I believe in myself?

1150
01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.400
You're asking me?

1151
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.240
No, I'm... I'm sure.

1152
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.880
I'm a great sorcerer.

1153
01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:46.560
Are you now?

1154
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.560
Funny thing about magic.

1155
01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.920
It chooses who may wield it.

1156
01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.360
And it does not suffer fools.

1157
01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.800
Why are you telling me this?

1158
01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.560
I think you know

1159
01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.440
Simon.

1160
01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.760
Did you attune with it?

1161
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.240
You okay?

1162
01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880
I got you.

1163
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.200
What happened?

1164
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720
I...

1165
01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.680
- I spoke to someone.
- Yeah?

1166
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:17.240
My great-great grandfather. He was...

1167
01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.200
- unhelpful.
- You spoke to him?

1168
01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:23.256
From here, it looked like the helmet
flew off the second you put it on.

1169
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.920
Well, time moves differently there.

1170
01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.360
Okay, I'll try a different approach.

1171
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.200
Great. New approach. Try it.

1172
01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.960
You got this. You got this.

1173
01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.440
You're getting better.
You didn't fly as far.

1174
01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:41.520
Stick with it.

1175
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.520
We have six hours
till we leave for Neverwinter.

1176
01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.520
You fail, I never get my family back.

1177
01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.640
Brilliant.

1178
01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:07.200
I've never seen a bigger coward.

1179
01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.600
Coward? You're under here, too.

1180
01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:11.640
Fine. I'll handle it.

1181
01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.200
No, no, no.

1182
01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.640
I've got this.

1183
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.680
And you want to be a Harper.

1184
01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:21.760
Quiet!

1185
01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:28.080
Oh, God. Damn.

1186
01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.680
There it is.

1187
01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.160
Stop trying to capture it.

1188
01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.760
You just have to let it go.

1189
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320
<i>Ed!</i>

1190
01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.560
Ed! We've got a problem.

1191
01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.040
I can't do it.

1192
01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.960
- The helmet?
- I've been at it for hours!

1193
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.840
I can't get past the old bastard!

1194
01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.200
I said I couldn't attune.
Now I'm the prat!

1195
01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.600
What's the racket?

1196
01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:57.080
He's having a little trouble
with the helm.

1197
01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.160
Come on, Simon, just do it.

1198
01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.600
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Thanks, Holga. I'll just do it.

1199
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.976
This is exactly what I told you
would happen back at the tavern

1200
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.080
but you wouldn't listen.

1201
01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:07.920
What do you mean, you told him?

1202
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.600
He said to keep it
between us for morale.

1203
01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.880
- I...
- Do you know why?

1204
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.520
Because he is the most
pigheaded person I've ever known!

1205
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.160
You talk us into doing things
you know won't work

1206
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.016
and then you blame us
when it goes pear-shaped!

1207
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.400
If you can't attune,
we'll figure out a Plan B.

1208
01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:25.000
Plan B? We dug up my family. We went
to the Underdark for that helmet.

1209
01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.200
And you knew the whole time
that he couldn't use it?

1210
01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.440
You humans.
You just can't help but lie.

1211
01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.120
I didn't lie.
I really thought Simon could do it.

1212
01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.040
Guys, look. We got a couple hours
till the games begin.

1213
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.280
This is what we do. We pivot.

1214
01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.736
Instead of dwelling on
what went wrong and who lied to whom

1215
01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.920
let's put our heads together
and figure out a plan!

1216
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.880
I'm gonna figure out my way home.

1217
01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.880
I can't believe I put my faith
in any of you.

1218
01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.120
Yeah, I'm going too.

1219
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.560
Sorry about Kira.

1220
01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.840
We'll find another way to get her.
Just not today.

1221
01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.800
It has to be today. We're not done
until my daughter's safe.

1222
01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.200
Aren't you sick of failing?

1223
01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.920
No! That's the whole point!

1224
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.040
We must never stop failing, because
the minute we do, we've failed.

1225
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.760
Look, none of us here
can say our lives...

1226
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.760
have gone the way we had hoped for.

1227
01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:12.480
Right?

1228
01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.760
Holga.

1229
01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.920
You left your tribe to be with a man

1230
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.280
who left you because you were
so upset about leaving your tribe.

1231
01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.200
And if you quit now, that's in stone!

1232
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.800
Same with you, Simon.

1233
01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.960
You're a petty thief masquerading
as a pettier sorcerer.

1234
01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.280
You gonna go back to your show?

1235
01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.360
It's better than dying.

1236
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.200
There's worse things than dying.

1237
01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.360
And, Doric, you have integrity

1238
01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:36.360
and I'm sure the last thing you want
to do is tell the Emerald Enclave

1239
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.296
that you had a chance
to save them but walked away.

1240
01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.920
You're quick to call us failures.

1241
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.600
- What about you, Ed?
- Me?

1242
01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.360
I'm the champion of failures!

1243
01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:48.240
I lost everything that ever mattered
to me and it was all my fault.

1244
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.920
You want to know
who really killed my wife?

1245
01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.920
I did.

1246
01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:05.200
<i>I decided we deserved a better life
than a Harper's oath would allow us.</i>

1247
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.600
<i>But I didn't know that
Red Wizards marked their treasure.</i>

1248
01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.800
I led them right to our door.

1249
01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.320
I didn't even have the good luck
to be home when they got there.

1250
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.000
I failed the Harpers, I failed
my family, I failed all of you.

1251
01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.000
Which is exactly why I can't quit.

1252
01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.680
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sit on this rock

1253
01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.880
and make a plan.

1254
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320
Move over.

1255
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.800
I'd sit too, but there's
no more room on the rock.

1256
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:24.680
How about this?

1257
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.440
We use the Hither-Thither Staff
to get into the vault.

1258
01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:29.720
No, I've explained this.

1259
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.880
You can't Hither-Thither
into a room you can't see.

1260
01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.920
I'm not saying that. I'm saying

1261
01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.960
we put the portal on something and
then sneak that thing into the vault.

1262
01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.240
The only thing going
in that vault is treasure.

1263
01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.360
So we put the portal
on some treasure.

1264
01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:48.640
Forge did say the richest men
in Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep

1265
01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.320
are bringing loot to the city.

1266
01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.360
They'll be traveling the High Road.
We could catch one of their convoys!

1267
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:55.536
But there'll be dozens of guards.

1268
01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.536
Yeah, but the guards
will be guarding against people

1269
01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.480
taking things out of their wagon,
not putting them in!

1270
01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.600
Holga, I could kiss you!

1271
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.680
Try it.

1272
01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.480
Perfect. Thank you so much.

1273
01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.880
What a profound joy it is
to welcome you

1274
01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.440
the good people of Neverwinter

1275
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.560
to the resumption
of the High Sun Games!

1276
01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.480
I guarantee that you are in
for the most riveting spectacle

1277
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.280
on all the Sword Coast.

1278
01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.800
The rules are very simple:

1279
01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:51.960
Five harrowing challenges.
Five teams of champions.

1280
01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.240
Whoever survives
to reach the Cage of Sanctuary

1281
01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.760
moves on to the next stage.

1282
01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680
One thing:

1283
01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:04.880
I do urge you, please do not leave
the arena till the close of the games

1284
01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.440
as there will be a wonderful gift

1285
01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.600
for each and every one of you!

1286
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.880
All right, take me down.

1287
01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:19.320
This is absurdly high.
It's not what we discussed.

1288
01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.840
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

1289
01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.200
It's facing the floor.
Why would they store it that way?

1290
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.616
- Damn it.
- Why does nothing go our way?

1291
01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.440
Let me try. Maybe I can make a gap.

1292
01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.120
The games have started.

1293
01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.600
We're going to Plan C.

1294
01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.480
Oh, bollocks. What's Plan C?

1295
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.800
Plan C is we go back to Plan A.

1296
01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.456
You're gonna attune to the helmet.

1297
01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.000
Why don't you just call it Plan A?

1298
01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:01.120
Plan A has a stink on it.

1299
01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.040
You know damn well
I can't attune to the thing.

1300
01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.240
That's not true!

1301
01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.560
You couldn't attune to it.
Look at me. Look at me!

1302
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.120
Do you remember
that job in Loudwater?

1303
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.560
You couldn't spider climb
until Jolym sicced his dog on you.

1304
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.600
And when we robbed
the spear of Aoth Fezim

1305
01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.400
your stoneskin spell failed
until the arrows were inches away.

1306
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.160
Even in Triboar, you flipped
the gravity of a whole theater!

1307
01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.600
You did?

1308
01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.320
By accident. It was wild magic

1309
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.776
and that only happened
because they were gonna kill me.

1310
01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.920
Exactly!

1311
01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.360
Look. You are at your strongest when
you think you're at your weakest.

1312
01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680
But you deliver.

1313
01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.200
You're gonna get
into that vault, okay?

1314
01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.800
Not because you can...

1315
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.000
but because you must.

1316
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.560
I'm gonna keep chipping away.

1317
01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:49.536
If I can get a quarter inch, I'll be
able to squeeze through as a worm.

1318
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.560
As a worm!

1319
01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.480
As a worm, perfect. You see this?
Now we have a Plan D if Plan C fails.

1320
01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.280
Isn't Plan D just Plan B again?

1321
01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.560
Plan B has a stink too.

1322
01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:58.800
It all stinks.

1323
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:01.720
Here. Use this to keep in contact.

1324
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.440
Well, this is a rock.

1325
01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.160
Actually it is a sending stone.

1326
01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.120
But they'll only work for an hour.

1327
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.880
Clever.

1328
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.920
So how we gonna get in there?

1329
01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.880
Easy. We just create a distraction.

1330
01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:20.000
I got a good feeling about Plan C.

1331
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:35.080
What's your business here?

1332
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.880
<i>When the battle is over</i>

1333
01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:39.600
<i>Friends become lovers</i>

1334
01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.720
<i>Sons embrace mothers,
brothers and dads</i>

1335
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.960
<i>Where once were contenders</i>

1336
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.720
<i>Now are befrienders</i>

1337
01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:50.080
<i>Oh, let's celebrate lasses and lads</i>

1338
01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.200
<i>Where once were contenders</i>

1339
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:53.640
<i>Now are befrienders</i>

1340
01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.480
<i>Let's celebrate lasses</i>

1341
01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:57.040
<i>Celebrate lasses</i>

1342
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.960
<i>Celebrate lasses</i>

1343
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.376
What's going on?
You're messing up my song!

1344
01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.400
My foot is stuck.

1345
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.000
Concentrate, Simon.

1346
01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:08.160
<i>Brate...</i>

1347
01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:09.600
What madness is this?

1348
01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:14.760
<i>Brate...</i>

1349
01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.120
I think they're starting
to get suspicious.

1350
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.160
Nine hells.

1351
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.520
- There! Interlopers!
- Come on!

1352
01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.800
Kira's room should be up there.

1353
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:36.720
Find the vault
and we'll meet you. Go!

1354
01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800
Halt!

1355
01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.040
There she is!

1356
01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.640
I'll hold them. Find the vault.

1357
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.640
- You sure I can't help?
- I'm certain.

1358
01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.240
- You don't have to be so certain.
- Get her!

1359
01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.360
I'm with the Absolution Council.
They've just gone up.

1360
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.680
Open up!

1361
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.880
Just a minute!

1362
01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:33.880
I don't mind that.

1363
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.480
Okay, you can do this.
Relax. No rush.

1364
01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160
There he is!

1365
01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.400
Put it down!

1366
01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.680
Look who's back.
The would-be sorcerer.

1367
01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.120
I don't have time for this!

1368
01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.080
Yet I have all the time there is.

1369
01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:53.520
You don't get it.
We're going to die if I don't attune!

1370
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.560
So you die a fool.
It's better than to live as one.

1371
01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.360
That's enough! You don't know me.

1372
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.200
I know you're a stain
on your family name!

1373
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.160
To hell with my name! Let me attune!

1374
01:32:03.240 --> 01:32:04.440
Not while I live.

1375
01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.560
You don't live!

1376
01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:07.840
You had your time. Now it's my turn.

1377
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.040
I won't allow it.

1378
01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.120
I don't care!

1379
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280
Sorry.

1380
01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.680
Took you long enough.

1381
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.720
Simon!

1382
01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.960
<i>Simon, was that you?</i>

1383
01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:39.920
It was! I did it!

1384
01:32:40.240 --> 01:32:41.240
Well done.

1385
01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.200
I guess it was just
me holding me back.

1386
01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:45.720
That's what I've been saying!

1387
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.440
I made it inside the vault.

1388
01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:56.800
So did we.

1389
01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:59.240
There's nothing here.

1390
01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:02.280
<i>What do you mean?
It's all here. Where are you?</i>

1391
01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.360
Where are you?

1392
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.560
I think I'm under the arena.

1393
01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.400
Forge.

1394
01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:09.520
This one here.

1395
01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.520
That's not good.

1396
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.800
Simon! Doric! You there?

1397
01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:40.000
What are you doing here?

1398
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.160
Kir!

1399
01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.560
I came for you.

1400
01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:46.920
We have to go.

1401
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:48.880
You left me.

1402
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.360
No. No, I know you think
I'm a liar and a bad father, but...

1403
01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:58.800
I am a bad father.

1404
01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:03.680
And I did leave you.

1405
01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:06.360
And I wasn't trying
to bring your mom back.

1406
01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.640
I was trying to...

1407
01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.000
bring my wife back.

1408
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.200
Which maybe if you had
gotten a chance to know her

1409
01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.760
and love her like I did,
you'd understand.

1410
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.680
But if you come with me now

1411
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.000
you can have that chance.

1412
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.680
You'd think you'd be able to
distinguish between your own daughter

1413
01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.120
and a 300-year-old wizard.

1414
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:49.880
Don't worry, Kira's safe.

1415
01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.800
Unlike me, she had no idea
you were coming.

1416
01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.760
I don't think she knows
how tenacious you've become.

1417
01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920
Look, Ed...

1418
01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:03.560
I'm really sorry about
the way things have worked out.

1419
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.760
But I think if you were truly honest

1420
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.840
you'd have to admit
I can give Kira a better life.

1421
01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.520
I hope you can take
comfort in knowing

1422
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.200
that she's with
the father she deserves.

1423
01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:18.920
And now I'm in a pickle
because I don't want to see you die.

1424
01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:23.680
Which is why
I'm gonna leave the room.

1425
01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.760
What?

1426
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.081
If you're gonna kill us,
at least let us die with dignity.

1427
01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.400
How do you mean?

1428
01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:42.320
Put us in the High Sun Games.
Give us a fighting chance.

1429
01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:44.960
That's not a chance.
It's not a chance at all.

1430
01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.600
I mean, even if you were
to somehow survive the tournament

1431
01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:48.680
Sofina's gonna...

1432
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.160
It would be much, much better for you
to die here than to go to the games.

1433
01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.240
No.

1434
01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:01.320
They defeated your men and mine.
Let them fight in the arena.

1435
01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:03.800
They deserve that much.

1436
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.720
Bad day.

1437
01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.640
You might want to go back to sleep.

1438
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.200
Are we...

1439
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:17.280
In the arena.

1440
01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:22.240
This dummy talked Forge
into putting us in the games.

1441
01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.000
Dummy? I saved our lives!

1442
01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.936
And I got us right above
where Doric said the treasure was.

1443
01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.440
Isn't it a little suspect
that Sofina would agree to this?

1444
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.360
Yeah, she's definitely
planned something.

1445
01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.920
Where under the arena were you?

1446
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Do you remember?

1447
01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:36.960
Not sure.

1448
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.560
There was a dock down there.

1449
01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:42.560
I saw guards loading
everything onto a ship.

1450
01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720
A ship.

1451
01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.560
Forge wasn't hiding
the loot from us.

1452
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.120
He was stealing it for himself.

1453
01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:51.480
He never cared about being Lord.

1454
01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.200
That just gave him
access to the vault.

1455
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.000
He must have brought back the games
so the take would be bigger.

1456
01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.400
What about Kira?

1457
01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.776
He won't leave her behind.
We have to get to that boat.

1458
01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.720
I don't understand.
If Forge is leaving

1459
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.360
what does Sofina get out of this?

1460
01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.360
Maybe I can get us out of here.

1461
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:20.080
Magic suppression cuff.

1462
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:21.680
They put one on me too.

1463
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.680
And just when
you were getting good at it.

1464
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.800
So we just go through the maze?

1465
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:25.520
I guess till we reach the cage?

1466
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:32.760
Run!

1467
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280
Follow me!

1468
01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920
Thanks.

1469
01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:46.400
Where are the others?

1470
01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.800
Come on, this way.

1471
01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.200
Have you tried Displacer Beast meat?

1472
01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.560
No. It's too gamey for me.

1473
01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:00.880
The ship is ready, sir.

1474
01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.760
It seems my ship is ready, so...

1475
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.920
Kira and I will be taking our leave.

1476
01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.400
I do hope that

1477
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.080
our collaboration has been
as gratifying for you

1478
01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.880
- as it has for...
- Get out of my city.

1479
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.480
Right.

1480
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760
Get out of the way!

1481
01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.760
It's burning!

1482
01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.120
Another minute,
I would have lost my hand.

1483
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.720
Yeah, but look what you did lose.

1484
01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:40.520
Come on.

1485
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.400
Doric? Doric!

1486
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.320
There must be a way
to get out of the arena.

1487
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200
Come on! Come on!

1488
01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:16.640
No.

1489
01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:19.480
- No, this isn't the way out.
- Yes, it is.

1490
01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.696
If we survive this, there'll be
another challenge and another

1491
01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.000
until every last person
in that cage is dead.

1492
01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.720
We have to find a work-around.

1493
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.760
I've got an idea. Follow me.

1494
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.680
Hey! What's your idea?

1495
01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:42.480
When we hear the gong, we jump in.

1496
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.160
Into this thing?

1497
01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:45.800
You want to end up like that guy?

1498
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.800
We will only be inside
for a few seconds.

1499
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:53.360
If we're all inside,
who's gonna pull us out?

1500
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.320
- I will, trust me.
- Always.

1501
01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880
Hold.

1502
01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.240
Hold.

1503
01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.080
Hold!

1504
01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.360
Now!

1505
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.200
Damn it! That stings!

1506
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.160
We gotta move.

1507
01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.040
I've been here.

1508
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.880
Our gear.

1509
01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.360
Simon. Try these on your cuff.

1510
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.880
Come with me.

1511
01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.200
Quite a second date, yeah?

1512
01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.000
- A-A trip?
- Yes.

1513
01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.760
Something urgent has come up,
but if we leave now we'll be safe.

1514
01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840
Safe from what?

1515
01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:39.320
- What is this?
- This is an ambush.

1516
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.041
On the boat you were gonna use
to escape from Neverwinter.

1517
01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.520
- Dad.
- Hi, honey.

1518
01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:45.920
Hey, Forge, why don't you
tell her what this is?

1519
01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.280
I don't know.

1520
01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.120
It's the Tablet of Reawakening, Kira.

1521
01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:51.760
It's the reason why I left you.

1522
01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.920
Your dad's been
telling you the truth, Bug.

1523
01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.320
It's Uncle Forge
who's been feeding you lies.

1524
01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.640
It's rubbish. It's just rubbish!

1525
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.040
Come with me, Kir.

1526
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.040
We'll go home, bring back Mom.

1527
01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:07.800
We can be a family again.

1528
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.160
You're not taking my money.

1529
01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:17.200
Put down the tablet
and get off my ship, all of you.

1530
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.360
- Now!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

1531
01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:20.440
What are you doing?

1532
01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.016
It's all right.
Shush, my darling, be quiet.

1533
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:24.080
It's going down. Just don't hurt her.

1534
01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.160
See that, Kira?

1535
01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.240
Your father knows me.

1536
01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.000
He knows I'm prepared to do
terrible things to get what I want.

1537
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:35.440
Even to those I care about most.

1538
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.480
In the end, that's all
that separates the beggar...

1539
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.560
Nobody hurts my Bug.

1540
01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:57.880
Simon, get us out of here!

1541
01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.520
Sorry, Ed.

1542
01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:12.440
Sorry, Forge!

1543
01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.360
- What's that one on about?
- Who knows?

1544
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.000
Twenty thousand on the Gray Hands!

1545
01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:37.520
I'm sorry I believed him.

1546
01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.880
What? What are you
talking about, honey?

1547
01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.840
You have nothing to apologize for.

1548
01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.400
I-I should have done
so many things differently.

1549
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.000
I had a whole apology,
but I sort of gave it to Sofina.

1550
01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.640
I love you, Kir.

1551
01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.240
And nothing will ever get in
the way of that again, okay?

1552
01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.480
Promise.

1553
01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.760
I love you too, Dad.

1554
01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.160
It's good to have you back, kid.

1555
01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.920
Do you know
how much loot is on this ship?

1556
01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:14.400
I'm surprised the boat can float.

1557
01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.640
All right.
So, we're gonna need to lay low.

1558
01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.680
What is that?

1559
01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.880
It's the Beckoning Death.

1560
01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.320
That's why she needed Forge.

1561
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.880
The games brought the city together
for the spell.

1562
01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:42.160
Szass Tam is taking Neverwinter.

1563
01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:53.360
Well, shit.

1564
01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.000
So what do we do when we get there?

1565
01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320
Working on it. Simon

1566
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.560
what did you say
the range was in that portal staff?

1567
01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.400
A quarter mile. Why?

1568
01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.880
I'm gonna keep that promise
I made to Xenk.

1569
01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.400
Whatever that is, stop it. Now!

1570
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.800
You there! Harbor master person.

1571
01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:55.880
Are you seeing this?

1572
01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.280
As Lord of Neverwinter

1573
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.640
I demand a ship and crew
to chase down five people who have...

1574
01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.000
What is this? No!

1575
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.160
It's the gift Forge promised!

1576
01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:41.600
No! No! No!

1577
01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:43.880
No, no, no! No! No!

1578
01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.000
No!

1579
01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:49.320
That's for you. Enjoy that.

1580
01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:51.520
All right.

1581
01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:53.680
This isn't over
until we take her out.

1582
01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:57.200
Whatever happens to us, stay hidden.

1583
01:48:57.760 --> 01:48:58.800
Use your pendant.

1584
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.760
Where do you think she's gone?

1585
01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.360
She missed.

1586
01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:03.760
You all right?

1587
01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.320
What do we do when we get to her?

1588
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.520
I got this.

1589
01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:28.360
You know not the scope of my power!

1590
01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.640
Enough!

1591
01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.360
It's another Time Stop!

1592
01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.560
Simon, can you counter it?

1593
01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:53.680
I can't. She's still too strong!

1594
01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.480
I'm so sorr...

1595
01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.200
For too long

1596
01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:05.080
I endured the arrogance
of Forge Fitzwilliam.

1597
01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.880
The false charm.

1598
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.560
The quips.

1599
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.200
And just as I begin
to purge this place

1600
01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:16.200
of its living filth,
you dare interpose.

1601
01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.280
Now, as you die

1602
01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:25.160
rest assured it will not be the end.

1603
01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:30.200
For you will forever suffer.

1604
01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:36.080
I'm sorry, your breath just
smells like... old clothes.

1605
01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:37.200
It's bad.

1606
01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:43.320
What is this?

1607
01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.040
I countered your Time Stop.
I got better.

1608
01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:48.520
We had to distract you
so Kira could slap on that cuff

1609
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.840
and so Doric could do this.

1610
01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.120
I think you got her.

1611
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.880
I honestly didn't think
that plan was gonna work.

1612
01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.160
You assured us it would.

1613
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.040
Hey, Holga!

1614
01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:22.800
- Did we get her?
- Holga?

1615
01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:24.840
Yeah.

1616
01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:26.560
Yeah, we got her.

1617
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:28.800
- That's...
- Oh, God.

1618
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:30.240
That's not a good spot, is it?

1619
01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:31.680
No, it's not bad.

1620
01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:34.480
Here.

1621
01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.280
Simon! Simon, help her.

1622
01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:40.720
It's a Red Wizard's blade.
There's nothing I can do.

1623
01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.760
Hey. Hey.

1624
01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.416
We're gonna patch you up,
it's not gonna be a problem.

1625
01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:47.560
Please don't go.

1626
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:50.440
- Easy, Bug, easy.
- Don't go.

1627
01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.840
Don't mourn me.

1628
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.640
No... no. No final words.
No final words.

1629
01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:56.160
I'm proud of what I did here.

1630
01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:58.560
I'm dying a hero.

1631
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:01.360
And you...

1632
01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:04.800
You're a good man.

1633
01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.840
A real Harper.

1634
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.680
Shut up. I'm a moron, you know that.

1635
01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:11.760
Promise me something.

1636
01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.000
Yeah, anything.

1637
01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:16.760
That you're gonna take
good care of our girl.

1638
01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.360
She's the best thing you ever did.

1639
01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.360
I will.

1640
01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:30.240
<i>Not fortune found, nor fate divine</i>

1641
01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:32.320
<i>- Come close to toping
- Come close to toping</i>

1642
01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.200
<i>- The juice of the vine
- The juice of the vine</i>

1643
01:55:35.320 --> 01:55:39.560
<i>- With cherry crew, we sip and sway
- With cherry crew, we sip and sway</i>

1644
01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.080
<i>- Let's tip the tankard
- Let's tip the tankard</i>

1645
01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.280
<i>- And waste the day
- And waste the day</i>

1646
01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:47.760
<i>Ree-raw! Well, ye ken</i>

1647
01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.400
No.

1648
01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.840
No!

1649
01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:57.200
I need you.

1650
01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:01.000
I need you.

1651
01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:58.760
We can only use it once.

1652
01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:03.280
I know.

1653
01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:31.040
Don't tell me you wasted it on me.

1654
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.240
Why would you do that?

1655
01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:57.880
Szass Tam won't be happy about this.

1656
01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.520
Well, if he comes after us,
we'll be ready.

1657
01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:01.640
We?

1658
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.040
That's right.
You don't like humans, do you?

1659
01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:07.440
Some are okay.

1660
01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:10.280
What about you?

1661
01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:13.640
Going back to the Harpers?
Be with your people?

1662
01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.400
I'm with my people.

1663
01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:24.000
So... I know my last attempt
to court you was quite bad.

1664
01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:28.000
But I wonder if you'd consider
having another go at it?

1665
01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.040
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah?

1666
01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:33.560
- Calm down.
- Right.

1667
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.520
Damn! Bloody chalice.

1668
01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:02.760
Good evening.

1669
01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:06.560
<i>Of course, you know
what happened after that.</i>

1670
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:10.880
<i>With Sofina's magic expunged,
Lord Neverember finally came to.</i>

1671
01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:14.600
<i>His first official act was to award</i>

1672
01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.760
<i>the saviors of Neverwinter
the Medal of Heroism.</i>

1673
01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.320
<i>And to the Emerald Enclave</i>

1674
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:23.760
<i>he granted formal protection
of their people and their land.</i>

1675
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.840
One could argue that my actions,
reprehensible though they were

1676
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.200
led to a virtual renaissance
for the city.

1677
01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:38.520
And while I've only served the first
year of my sentence, I have to say

1678
01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.240
it has been

1679
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:42.360
eye-opening.

1680
01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:46.040
I have taken a look inside

1681
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:48.320
and I've asked myself

1682
01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:50.760
"What's going on in there?"

1683
01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:53.240
And, you know, I realized

1684
01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:56.480
a lot of it goes back to my mum.

1685
01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:00.760
She was a stern woman,
prone to fits of...

1686
02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:02.760
Stop, stop! We've heard enough.

1687
02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:05.560
Pardon denied.

1688
02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:08.520
This session is adjourned.

1689
02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:14.640
Jarnathan!

1690
02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.800
No, no! I'm terribly sorry.

1691
02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.520
I don't know what came over me,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1692
02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:32.200
Hello?

1693
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.680
Can somebody please
ask me another question?

1694
02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:39.320
Anyone?
