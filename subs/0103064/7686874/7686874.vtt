You forgot to say please.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.810
Ooh!

20
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.320
Oh!

21
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.160
Aagh! Get him off me!

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.050
Agh!

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.720
Pull it out! Pull it out!

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.600
Agh! Pull it out!

25
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.450
Take it.

26
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.610
Can't let you take the man's wheels, son.

27
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.650
Now, get off before I put you down.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.080

Ugh!

John!

35
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.460
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

36
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.050
John!

37
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.590
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

38
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.100
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

39
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.810
He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

40
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.810
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

41
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.730
Todd!
- What?

42
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.190
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

43
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.320
Well, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

44
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.870
Come on!
- John!

45
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.210
C'mon! Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

46
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.050
She's not my mother, Todd.

47
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.280
This next patient is interesting.

48
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.950
I've been following the case for years.

49
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.160
A 29-year-old female,

50
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.130
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

51
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.380
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

52
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.130
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

53
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.930
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

54
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.980
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

55
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.400
which looked human, of course,

56
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.190
was sent back through time
to kill her.

57
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.530
That's original.

58
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.440
And also, that the father of her child

59
00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.490
was a soldier sent back to protect her.

60
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.990
No?
- He was from the future too.

61
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.000
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

62
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.080
And here we are.

63
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.960
Morning, Sarah.

64
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.260
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

65
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.050
Fine, Sarah.

66
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:41.440
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

67
00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.600
Repeated escape attempts...

68
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.030
Let's move on, shall we?

69
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.240
Lewis,

70
00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.890
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

71
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.170
See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

72
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.730
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

73
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.860
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

74
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.410
Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

75
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.330
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

76
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.040
Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

77
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.340
You gonna tell me what this is about?

78
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.420
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

79
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.880
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

80
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:58.350
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

81
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.260
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

82
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.390
Has that got something
to do with this?

83
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.650
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

84
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.570
Thanks for your cooperation.

85
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.320
Please insert your stolen card now.

86
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.580
PIN number.

87
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.420
Hurry up.
This is taking too long.

88
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.000
Go, baby. Go, baby.

89
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:33.050
All right!

90
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.760
PIN number 9003.
- Where did you learn this stuff from?

91
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.390
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

92
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.680
Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.

93
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.600
Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!

94
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.900
Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

95
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.650
All right. Easy money. Come on!

96
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.280
Yes! Piece of cake.

97
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.660
Is that her?
- Yes.

98
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.920
She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

99
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.750
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

100
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.510
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

101
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.010
but she got shot and arrested.

102
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.680
No shit.

103
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.810
She's a total loser.

104
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.600
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

105
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.700
It's like a giant strobe light

106
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.160
burning right through my eyes.

107
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.630
Somehow, I can still see.

108
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.470
Oh, God.

109
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.230
We know
the dream's the same every night.

110
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.770
Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

111
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.190
Children look like burnt paper.

112
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.410
Black.

113
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:23.990
Not moving.

114
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.750
And then the blast wave hits them.

115
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.130
And they fly apart like leaves.

116
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:47.260
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

117
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.350
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

118
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.320
I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

119
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:02.610
On August 29 1997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

120
00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.280
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

121
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.990
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

122
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.210
God! You think you're safe and alive.

123
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.580
You're already dead. Everybody!

124
00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.210
Him. You. You're dead already.

125
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.170
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

126
00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.340
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

127
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.340
Cos I know it happened!

128
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.140
It happened!

129
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.360
I feel much better now.

130
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.320
Clearer.

131
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.870
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

132
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.420
It's helped me to have a goal,

133
00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.670
something to look forward to.

134
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.920
What is that?

135
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.260
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

136
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.020
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

137
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.310
and I could have visitors.

138
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.900
Well, it's been six months and...

139
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.950
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

140
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.660
I see.

141
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.920
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

142
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.380
Now you think they don't exist?

143
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.800
They don't exist.

144
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.590
I know that now.

145
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.590
But you've told me
on many occasions

146
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.140
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

147
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.520
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

148
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.020
They would have found something
at the factory.

149
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.230
I see.

150
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.270
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

151
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.900
No. Why would they?

152
00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.070
Let's try a new position right there.

153
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.450
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

154
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.160
Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

155
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040
Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...

156
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.340
Mr Dyson?

157
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.210
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

158
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.930
Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

159
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.970
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

160
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:34.010
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

161
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.140
You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

162
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:39.980
Mr Dyson,

163
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.200
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

164
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.400
I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

165
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.150
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

166
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.660
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

167
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.030
"Don't ask."

168
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.830
Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

169
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.130
Insert key.

170
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.300
Left on three, two, one, turn.

171
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.970
How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

172
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.350
There you go.

173
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.630
So, what do you think, Doctor?

174
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.460
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

175
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.880
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

176
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.430
I know how smart you are.

177
00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.180
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

178
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:59.980
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

179
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.980
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

180
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:04.190
you'll just try to escape again.

181
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.860
You have to let me see my son.

182
00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.320
Please.

183
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.120
Please.

184
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.290
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

185
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.250
If I could just make a phone call...

186
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.380
Afraid not. Not for a while.

187
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.590
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

188
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.090
that you stay here
for another six months.

189
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.180
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

190
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.020
Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

191
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.480
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

192
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.830
You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

193
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.160
You don't know what you're doing!

194
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.620
Model citizen.

195
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.580
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

196
00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:47.370
He said he was going to the galleria?

197
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.630
Yeah.

198
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.460
The galleria?

199
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.880
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

200
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.570
Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

201
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.280
No.

202
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:04.330
Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

203
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.500
John.
- Not now.

204
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.550
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

205
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.930
He's right over there.
- Split, man.

206
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.050
Just go.
- Yeah.

207
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.310
I saw that kid...

208
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.640
Hey!

209
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:46.700
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

210
00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:06.430
Hey!

211
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.600
Get down.

212
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.550
Mister, are you all right?

213
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.450
Come on!

214
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.030
Goddamn!

215
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.980
Agh!

216
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.560
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

217
00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:10.690
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

218
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.120
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

219
00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.370
But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

220
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:33.420
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

221
00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.220
Holy shit! You're really real.

222
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.100
I mean...

223
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:59.150
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

224
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.150
I'm a cybernetic organism:

225
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.910
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

226
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.840
This is intense.

227
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.760
Get a grip, John. OK.

228
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.430
You're not here to kill me.

229
00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.560
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

230
00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.360
My mission is to protect you.

231
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.070
Yeah? Who sent you?

232
00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360
You did.

233
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.900
35 years from now,

234
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:45.490
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

235
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.450
Oh, this is deep.

236
00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:53.580
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

237
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.250
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

238
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.380
More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

239
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.720
What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

240
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.600
Where are we going?

241
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.560
We have to get out of the city
immediately

242
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:13.020
and avoid the authorities.

243
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.480
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

244
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.650
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

245
00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.530
You sure?
- I would.

246
00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:36.880
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

247
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:40.550
...but I gotta warn them.

248
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.090
Shit! You got a quarter?

249
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.810
Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

250
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.230
John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

251
00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.730
Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

252
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.940
Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

253
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.610
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

254
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.370
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

255
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.990
I'm making beef stew.

256
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.290
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

257
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.870
John, where are you?

258
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.830
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

259
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.170
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

260
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.710
The dog's really barking.

261
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.280
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

262
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:32.680
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

263
00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.890
Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

264
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.270
I'm right here. I'm fine.

265
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.980
'Are you sure you're all right?'

266
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.980
What's the dog's name?
- Max.

267
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.820
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfie?

268
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:49.490
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

269
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.370
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

270
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.200
Where are you?

271
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.870
Your foster parents are dead.

272
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.870
No, no. I need a minute here.

273
00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:42.250
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

274
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.790
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

275
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.800
Get real.

276
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.630
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

277
00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.510
No, only an object of equal size.

278
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.140
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

279
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.390
It can't form complex machines.

280
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.560
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

281
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.060
It doesn't work that way.

282
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.060
But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

283
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:06.270
Knives and stabbing weapons.

284
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:09.530
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

285
00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.110
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

286
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.540
He killed
17 police officers that night.

287
00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.290
Men with families...

288
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.250
...children.

289
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.090
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

290
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.390
Miss Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

291
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.850
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

292
00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.940
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

293
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.400
We know this guy's involved.

294
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.440
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

295
00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:01.960
We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

296
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.670
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

297
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.380
as time goes on.

298
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.250
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

299
00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.130
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

300
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.680
Sure.

301
00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.640
Douglas, take her back to her room, please.

302
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:17.930
Yes, sir.

303
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.640
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

304
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.810
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

305
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:32.570
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

306
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.990
running guns.

307
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.030
Then there were some other guys.

308
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.120
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

309
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.410
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

310
00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.210
Then she gets busted.

311
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.920
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

312
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.260
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

313
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.130
was all made-up bullshit.

314
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.760
I hated her for that.

315
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.730
But everything she said was true.

316
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.980
She knew.

317
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.230
And nobody believed her.

318
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:15.900
Not even me.

319
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.700
Listen, we gotta get her out of there.

320
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.240
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

321
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:24.660
will be to copy Sarah Connor

322
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.510
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

323
00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.540
Great. What happens to her?

324
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.500
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

325
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.670
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

326
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.010
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

327
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:39.220
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

328
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.930
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

329
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.980
Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

330
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.520
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

331
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.650
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

332
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860
Let me go!

333
00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:02.080
Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

334
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.580
What?

335
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.380
You have to do what I say, huh?

336
00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.670
That's one of my mission parameters.

337
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.470
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

338
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.010
Yes!

339
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.810
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

340
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:34.020
You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

341
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:38.650
Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

342
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:41.070
Dipshit?

343
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.120
Put your leg down.

344
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:50.000
Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

345
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.460
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

346
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.290
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

347
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.550
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

348
00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.970
Get off me!

349
00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.310
No!

350
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.850
Put the gun down, now!

351
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.230
Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

352
00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.070
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

353
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.280
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

354
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.160
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

355
00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.580
You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?

356
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:35.880
You got that?

357
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.420
You just can't go around
killing people.

358
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:39.630
Why?

359
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.630
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

360
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840
Why?

361
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.550
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

362
00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.060
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

363
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.690
And I order you to help me.

364
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.640
Hm!

365
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.460
Hi!

366
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:30.720
You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

367
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:33.180
They've been in there for an hour.

368
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:35.720
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

369
00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.230
Oh, here come your friends now.

370
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.830
Well, that was productive.

371
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.290
Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

372
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.050
How 'bout a beer?

373
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.670
Yeah, right!

374
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:17.200
Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

375
00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.330
Must be my lucky day.

376
00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:44.390
I think you're right about number 24.

377
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.310
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

378
00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.730
Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.910
You!

380
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.040
You broke my arm.

381
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:14.840
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

382
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.590
That's one. Now, don't move.

383
00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:25.260
What are you gonna do?

384
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:30.930
Why do we stop now?

385
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:35.980
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

386
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.650
Right.
- Swear?

387
00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:40.240
What?

388
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.450
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

389
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.490
I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

390
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:59.420
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

391
00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.470
What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

392
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.600
You crazy bastard!

393
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:17.150
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

394
00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:22.440
He'll live.

395
00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.290
Son of a bitch!

396
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.090
Let's try to remain calm.

397
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.270
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

398
00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:46.220
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

399
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:48.550
Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

400
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.600
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

401
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:52.430
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

402
00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.980
I don't believe you can do it.

403
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.440
You're already dead, Silberman.

404
00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.120
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

405
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.900
So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

406
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.410
Back off!

407
00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:10.910
Get back!

408
00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.910
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

409
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:16.330
Don't move!

410
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:20.630
Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

411
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.510
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

412
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.800
Not you!

413
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.510
Open the door.

414
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:31.760
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

415
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:50.490
Get her! Get her!

416
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.270
Sarah!

417
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:21.310
Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

418
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.270
Let's go! Open it!

419
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480
Get the other door!

420
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.740
She broke it off.
- Open it!

421
00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:36.450
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

422
00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:03.150
No!

423
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.690
No!

424
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.740
No!
- Mom, wait!

425
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.240
Mom!

426
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:20.410
Come back here!
- No! No!

427
00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.120
No!

428
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.830
Help her!
- Wait here.

429
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.540
Hurry up!

430
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:27.710
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

431
00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.010
Hold her.

432
00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.260
He'll kill us all!

433
00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:56.160
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

434
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:03.170
Come with me, if you want to live.

435
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:05.580
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

436
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.530
Go.

437
00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:06.400
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

438
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.660
Get down.

439
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.970
No! Mom!

440
00:58:59.110 --> 00:59:00.490
Out of the car!

441
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:03.080
Right now!

442
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:29.560
Go!

443
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:41.030
I'm out.

444
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.750
Come on.
- Here.

445
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:54.380
Reload.

446
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.310
Last one!

447
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.060
Hang on.

448
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.680
Ready!

449
01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:48.600
John!

450
01:00:55.690 --> 01:00:57.320
Here, drive.

451
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.000
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

452
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.370
Are you all right?
- Yeah.

453
01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.920
Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

454
01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:05.550
Cool.

455
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.850
Come here.

456
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.610
I said I was OK.

457
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.530
John, it was stupid of you to go there.

458
01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:25.780
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

459
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:27.450
You almost got yourself killed.

460
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.410
What were you thinking?

461
01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:33.950
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

462
01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.500
Do you understand?

463
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:39.880
You're too important.
Do you understand?

464
01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880
But...

465
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.300
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

466
01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.890
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

467
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.730
What's wrong with your eyes?

468
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:05.240
Nothing.

469
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.540
So, what's your story?

470
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:29.180
You OK?

471
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.800
Fine.

472
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.810
Say, that's a nice bike.

473
01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.960
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

474
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.760
Listen, do you know what you're doing?

475
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:13.800
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

476
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.730
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

477
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:20.980
Correct.

478
01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:29.030
Does it hurt when you get shot?

479
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.450
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain".

480
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.950
John, help me with the light.

481
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.000
Will these heal up?
- Yes.

482
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:44.630
Good. If you can't pass for a human,
you're not much good to us.

483
01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:47.800
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

484
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.670
120 years with my existing power cell.

485
01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:53.720
Can you learn stuff that
you haven't been programmed with,

486
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:55.600
so you can be...

487
01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:01.180
...you know, more human,
and not such a dork all the time?

488
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.270
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

489
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.190
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

490
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.030
Cool.

491
01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.980
Are we learning yet?

492
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:51.440
Mom!

493
01:05:58.990 --> 01:06:01.950
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

494
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:07.710
Just head south.

495
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.720
Keep it under 65.

496
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.560
We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

497
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:26.270
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

498
01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.900
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

499
01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:32.280
You say, "No problemo."

500
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:36.280
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

501
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:40.620
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

502
01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:43.240
Hasta la vista, baby.

503
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

504
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.000
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

505
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:53.630
Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

506
01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:56.470
That's great. See? You're getting it.

507
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:58.590
No problemo.

508
01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:15.110
Want some of my fries?

509
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:28.920
Need any help?
- No.

510
01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.500
I got you!
- No, you didn't!

511
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.550
I did!
I came round here and I got you!

512
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:38.420
No, you didn't!

513
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.430
We're not gonna make it, are we?

514
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.470
People, I mean.

515
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.480
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

516
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:54.270
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

517
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.360
Break it up before
I wring both of your necks.

518
01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:03.830
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

519
01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:07.500
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

520
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:09.540
Who is that?

521
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:12.880
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

522
01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.800
Why him?

523
01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:20.260
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

524
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:21.720
of microprocessor.

525
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:25.720
Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

526
01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.890
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

527
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.350
of military computer systems.

528
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:33.150
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

529
01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.690
becoming fully unmanned.

530
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:38.030
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

531
01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:40.610
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

532
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.120
The system goes on-line
on August 4 1997.

533
01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:47.240
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

534
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:50.160
Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.

535
01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:54.540
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

536
01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:58.050
In a panic, they try to pull the plug.

537
01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.590
Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

538
01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.300
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

539
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:07.560
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

540
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.020
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

541
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.020
will eliminate its enemies over here.

542
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.730
Jesus!

543

How much do you know about Dyson?

that's how people lived,

hung around with were geeks,

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.660
I always have.

698
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:07.950
I know.

699
01:26:14.410 --> 01:26:16.460
Deep penetration.

700
01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:20.000
No shattered bone.

701
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:23.010
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

702
01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:37.100
Who are you people?
- Show him.

703
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.440
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

704
01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.630
Oh, God! No!

705
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.390
Oh, my God!

706
01:27:24.650 --> 01:27:26.150
Oh, my God.

707
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.820
Now, listen to me very carefully.

708
01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.620
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

709
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:38.870
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

710
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.670
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

711
01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:45.920
'The history of things to come.

712
01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.590
'It's not every day that you find out

713
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.180
'you're responsible
for three billion deaths.

714
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:54.970
'He took it pretty well.'

715
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:58.980
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

716
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.070
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

717
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.450
How were we supposed to know?

718
01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.170
Yeah!

719
01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:21.880
Right.

720
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:25.880
How were you supposed to know?

721
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:29.670
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

722
01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:34.100
Men like you thought it up.

723
01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:40.940
You think you're so creative.

724
01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:44.190
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

725
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:47.980
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

726
01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:50.450
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

727
01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:52.030
Mom!

728
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:56.620
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

729
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.870
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

730
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.710
But I thought...

731
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.750
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

732
01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:09.510
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

733
01:29:09.710 --> 01:29:12.380
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

734
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:16.180
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

735
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:19.390
No one must follow your work.
- Right.

736
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.310
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

737
01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:28.940
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

738
01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:32.610
Everything. I don't care.

739
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:35.610
The chip.

740
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:37.590
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

741
01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.290
They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.

742
01:29:39.490 --> 01:29:40.920
It must be from the other one like you.

743
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:45.330
The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

744
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.130
They told us not to ask where they got it.

745
01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.550
Those lying motherfuckers.

746
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.420
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

747
01:29:52.630 --> 01:29:54.760
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

748
01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:56.340
but it gave us ideas,

749
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:59.430
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

750
01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.690
All my work was based on it.

751
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:05.560
It must be destroyed.

752
01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.860
Can you get us in? Past security?

753
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.990
I think so, yeah. When?

754
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.030
Now?

755
01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:25.920
'The future, always so clear to me,

756
01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:29.040
'had become like a black highway at night.

757
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:34.800
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

758
01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:14.760
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

759
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:18.350
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

760
01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.760
Hi!

761
01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:21.890
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

762
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:25.270
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

763
01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.480
I need written authorisation...

764
01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:32.400
I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

765
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:44.910
Come on. It's OK.

766
01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:47.770
It takes two keys to open the vault.

767
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:49.500
They have to be turned simultaneously.

768
01:31:49.710 --> 01:31:52.380
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

769
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.260
Gibbons?

770
01:31:58.510 --> 01:32:03.180
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

771
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:06.730
Gibbons!

772
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.520
Oh, shit.

773
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.540
My card should access this.

774
01:32:33.250 --> 01:32:35.380
What? What is it?
- Damn it.

775
01:32:36.630 --> 01:32:38.420
The silent alarm's been tripped.

776
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:47.350
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

777
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:51.140
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

778
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.810
No.

779
01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:58.690
We go all the way. OK?

780
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:04.660
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

781
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:06.310
I think it's that guy from the mall.

782
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:07.490
It is!

783
01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:09.790
It's him and the woman.

784
01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.960
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

785
01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:19.800
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

786
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:26.640
It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

787
01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:33.850
John, fire in the hole!

788
01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:50.700
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

789
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.340
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

790
01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.090
Put this on.

791
01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:20.610
All right, let's get to work.

792
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.420
'All units in the vicinity

793
01:34:43.630 --> 01:34:45.050

Easy money.

806
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:18.060
Uh-oh.

807
01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:23.060
Oh, shit! Not good.

808
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:24.440
Not good!

809
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.530
How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

810
01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:33.990
One more barrel, two more minutes.

811
01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:40.870
How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

812
01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:43.330
Piece of cake.

813
01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:44.960
We got company.
- Police?

814
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:48.380
How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

815
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:50.510
Go. I'll finish here.

816
01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:53.260
Come on.

817
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:57.640
I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

818
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:02.020
Trust me.

819
01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.330
'You at the window!

We go same time, to the left.

826
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:02.430
One, two, three, go.

827
01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.900
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

828
01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:28.250
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

829
01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:30.960
Hold your fire!

830
01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:58.860
Ready to rock?
- Ready.

831
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:04.990
Time to go. Now.

832
01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.000
Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

833
01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:11.170
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

834
01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:38.190

835
01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:17.780
Aagh!

01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:23.860
Shit!

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.120
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

838
01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:39.300
Get down!

839
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:47.680
Here.

840
01:42:13.410 --> 01:42:16.210
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

841
01:42:21.050 --> 01:42:23.760
Fall back! Everybody out!

842
01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:25.720
Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!

843

'We got a war zone down here!

Stay here. I'll be back.

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.640
Get down on the floor, face down!

847
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:00.940
Down on the floor now!

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:04.780
OK, drop him!

849
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:44.480
Agh!

850
01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:26.570
Here, hold this.

851
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:40.660
I think it's him!

852
01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.500

Shit!

855
01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.650
Get out.

856
01:46:58.120 --> 01:46:59.620
Aagh!

857
01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:18.800
Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

858
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:20.430
You got it?
- Yeah.

859
01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:22.140
All right.

860
01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.660
Chopper's coming in!
- It's him.

861
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:37.800
Yeah!

862
01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:41.840
John! Stay down!

863
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:08.950
Aagh!
- Mom!

864
01:49:50.120 --> 01:49:51.120
Hello?

865
01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.170
Goddamn! You all right...?

866
01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:08.680
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

867
01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.940
Take the shotgun.
- OK.

868
01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:16.060
Agh!

869
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.190
Are you hurt?

870
01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:34.830
Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

871
01:50:35.540 --> 01:50:36.540
Hurry!

872
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:44.380
Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

873
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:48.140
Come on! Go!

874
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:56.150
What the hell...?

875
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.780
I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

876
01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:08.070
Here. This'll work.

877
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:16.120
He's gaining.

878
01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:20.880
Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

879
01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:23.130
I can run faster than this!

880
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:34.770
Coming up, to the right.

881
01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.770
Watch it! Watch it!

882
01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:03.550
Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

883
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:12.890
Take the off-ramp.

884
01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:23.940
Shit!

885
01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:28.780
Hold on!

886
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.660
Don't stop!

887
01:53:24.210 --> 01:53:25.380
Go straight!

888
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:28.920
Look out!
- Duck!

889
01:53:44.190 --> 01:53:45.690
Get the hell outta here!

890
01:53:51.650 --> 01:53:54.320
Get outta here! Let's go!

891
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:13.690
Hasta la vista, baby.

892
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:04.790
We don't have much time.

893
01:56:27.850 --> 01:56:28.850
Let's go.

894
01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:31.480
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

895
01:56:31.690 --> 01:56:33.650
Come on! Get up!

896
01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.960
Hand me the shotgun.

897
01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:56.050
Put your weight on me, Mom.

898
01:56:57.130 --> 01:56:58.760
Hurry!

899
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:03.970
Come on, Mom.

900
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.770
Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

901
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:29.750
This way. Come on.

902
01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:43.720
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

903
01:57:43.930 --> 01:57:45.050
Go back.

904
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.520
Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

905
01:57:56.150 --> 01:57:57.610
John, you've got to go now.

906
01:57:57.820 --> 01:57:59.820
John!
- Go! Now!

907
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:01.360
No!

908
01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.270
Get up the steps.

909
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:19.440
Go on.

910
01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.910
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

911
01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520
No!

912
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:04.780
Grab the chain. Grab it.

913
02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:08.780
Grab it. Go. Go!

914
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.420
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

915
02:00:22.630 --> 02:00:24.090
Come on!

916
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.590
Mom!

917
02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:28.970
Mom! Mom! Mom!

918
02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.460
Agh!

919
02:01:12.090 --> 02:01:13.090
Call to John.

920
02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:16.140
No!

921
02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.890
I know this hurts.

922
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:21.350
Ugh!
- Call John.

923
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:40.710
Call to John now.

924
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:44.130
Fuck you!

925
02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:59.490
John? John!

926
02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:03.070
John? Help!

927
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:07.200
John!

928
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.670
John?

929
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.340
John!

930
02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:19.670
John.

931
02:05:20.630 --> 02:05:22.140
John.

932
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:26.350
Mom.
- Help me.

933
02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.390
Help me.

934
02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.940
Help me.

935
02:05:32.150 --> 02:05:33.270
Get out of the way, John.

936
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:34.480
Shoot!

937
02:06:18.110 --> 02:06:19.530
Mom!

938
02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:30.750
Get down!

939
02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:03.950
No!

940
02:08:05.130 --> 02:08:07.340
Get up. Come on.

941
02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:11.100
Holy shit!

942
02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:12.970
I need a vacation.

943
02:08:27.490 --> 02:08:31.160
Is it dead?
- Terminated.

944
02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:36.290
Will this melt in there?

945
02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:41.130
Yes. Throw it in.

946
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:47.010
Adiós!

947
02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.050
And the chip.

948
02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.940
It's over.

949
02:09:09.490 --> 02:09:10.530
No.

950
02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.450
There's one more chip.

951
02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:22.420
And it must be destroyed also.

952
02:09:28.090 --> 02:09:29.470
Here.

953
02:09:29.670 --> 02:09:33.680
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

954
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:40.850
No.

955
02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:43.140
No.

956
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.690
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

957
02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.900
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

958
02:09:51.110 --> 02:09:52.990
It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

959
02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.660
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

960
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:58.620
I must go away, John.
- No!

961
02:09:59.290 --> 02:10:00.370
No, wait.

962
02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:03.330
You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

963
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:06.540
No, don't do it! Don't go!

964
02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.550
It has to end here.

965
02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:13.050
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

966
02:10:13.260 --> 02:10:14.760
I order you not to go!

967
02:10:21.310 --> 02:10:23.060
I know now why you cry.

968
02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:27.730
But it's something I can never do.

969
02:11:02.850 --> 02:11:04.440
Goodbye.

970
02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.160
'The unknown future rolls toward us.

971
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:50.210
'I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

972
02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:55.710
'Because if a machine, a Terminator
can learn the value of human life...

973
02:12:56.710 --> 02:12:59.470
'...maybe we can, too.'
