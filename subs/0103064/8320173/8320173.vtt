179
00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:47.872
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

180
00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.425
It's helped me to have a goal,

181
00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.678
something to look forward to.

182
00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:03.929
What is that?

183
00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:10.269
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

184
00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:13.022
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

185
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.317
and I could have visitors.

186
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:20.905
Well, it's been six months and...

187
00:21:22.823 --> 00:21:24.950
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

188
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.661
I see.

189
00:21:29.413 --> 00:21:30.623
(Sighs)

190
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:35.920
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

191
00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.381
Now you think they don't exist?

192
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.801
They don't exist.

193
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:43.594
I know that now.

194
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.596
But you've told me
on many occasions

195
00:21:45.805 --> 00:21:49.141
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

196
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:53.521
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

197
00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.023
They would have found something
at the factory.

198
00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:58.234
(Silberman) I see.

199
00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:02.279
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

200
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:06.909
No. Why would they?

201
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.079
Let's try a new position right there.

202
00:22:10.287 --> 00:22:14.458
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

203
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:17.169
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

204
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:20.047
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

205
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.340
Mr Dyson?

206
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:25.219
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

207
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:27.930
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

208
00:22:28.138 --> 00:22:30.975
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

209
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:34.019
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

210
00:22:34.228 --> 00:22:37.147
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

211
00:22:38.941 --> 00:22:39.984
Mr Dyson,

212
00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.027
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

213
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:44.405
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

214
00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.157
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

215
00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:50.661
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

216
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.037
"Don't ask."

217
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.838
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

218
00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.132
Insert key.

219
00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.302
Left on three, two, one, turn.

220
00:23:10.222 --> 00:23:11.974
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

221
00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:13.350
There you go.

222
00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.631
(Sarah) So,
what do you think, Doctor?

223
00:23:44.715 --> 00:23:46.467
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

224
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:50.888
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

225
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.432
I know how smart you are.

226
00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.143
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

227
00:23:57.394 --> 00:23:59.980
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

228
00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.982
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

229
00:24:02.191 --> 00:24:04.193
you'll just try to escape again.

230
00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:11.867
You have to let me see my son.

231
00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:14.328
Please.

232
00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.122
Please.

233
00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:22.294
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

234
00:24:22.503 --> 00:24:24.254
If I could just make a phone call...

235
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:27.383
Afraid not. Not for a while.

236
00:24:29.259 --> 00:24:31.595
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

237
00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:34.098
that you stay here
for another six months.

238
00:24:37.434 --> 00:24:39.186
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

239
00:24:39.395 --> 00:24:41.563
(Silberman choking)

240
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:45.025
- Get her off of mel
- You son of a bitch!

241
00:24:45.234 --> 00:24:47.486
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

242
00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.782
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

243
00:24:54.535 --> 00:24:57.162
You don't know what you're doing!

244
00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:03.627
Model citizen.

245
00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:07.297
(♪ Rock music blaring)

246
00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:18.559
(Engine roars)

247
00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:28.861
(Tyres screech)

248
00:25:32.364 --> 00:25:34.033
(Car horns honk)

249
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:35.617
(Crash)

250
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.586
(Girl) You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

251
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.379
He said he was going to the galleria?

252
00:25:47.588 --> 00:25:48.630
Yeah.

253
00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:50.466
The galleria?

254
00:25:57.306 --> 00:26:00.309
(Cacophony of video games)

255
00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:29.546
(Inaudible)

256
00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:38.889
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

257
00:26:46.146 --> 00:26:48.774
(Explosions, gunfire)

258
00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.573
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

259
00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.283
(Girls) No.

260
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:04.331
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

261
00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:12.506
- John.
- Not now.

262
00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:15.551
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

263
00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:20.931
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

264
00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.058
- Just go.
- Yeah.

265
00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:29.314
I saw that kid...

266
00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:30.649
Hey!

267
00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:46.707
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

268
00:28:04.892 --> 00:28:06.435
Hey!

269
00:28:12.566 --> 00:28:13.609
Get down.

270
00:28:13.817 --> 00:28:15.235
(Gunshot)

271
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.704
(John screams)

272
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.556
Mister, are you all right?

273
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:28.934
(Camera shutter clicking)

274
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:42.990
(Engine won't start)

275
00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:45.450
Come on!

276
00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.919
(Engine starts)

277
00:30:25.699 --> 00:30:27.034
Goddamn!

278
00:30:44.926 --> 00:30:46.553
(Horns honk)

279
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.803
(Brakes screech)

280
00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:50.987
Agh!

281
00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:08.565
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

282
00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.692
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

283
00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.125
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

284
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:29.377
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

285
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:33.423
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

286
00:35:44.142 --> 00:35:48.229
Holy shit! You're really real.

287
00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:52.108
I mean...

288
00:35:54.778 --> 00:35:59.157
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

289
00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:01.159
I'm a cybernetic organism:

290
00:36:01.368 --> 00:36:03.912
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

291
00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:20.845
This is intense.

292
00:36:21.054 --> 00:36:23.765
Get a grip, John. OK.

293
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:28.436
You're not here to kill me.

294
00:36:28.645 --> 00:36:32.565
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

295
00:36:32.774 --> 00:36:35.360
My mission is to protect you.

296
00:36:35.568 --> 00:36:38.071
Yeah? Who sent you?

297
00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.365
You did.

298
00:36:40.573 --> 00:36:41.908
35 years from now,

299
00:36:42.117 --> 00:36:45.495
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

300
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:48.456
Oh, this is deep.

301
00:36:50.542 --> 00:36:53.586
So this other guy,
he's a Terminator like you, right?

302
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:57.257
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

303
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:03.388
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

304
00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:06.725
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

305
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:09.602
Where are we going?

306
00:37:09.811 --> 00:37:11.563
We have to get out of the city
immediately

307
00:37:11.771 --> 00:37:13.022
and avoid the authorities.

308
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.484
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

309
00:37:16.693 --> 00:37:20.655
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

310
00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:23.533
- You sure?
- I would.

311
00:37:34.294 --> 00:37:36.880
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

312
00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.550
...but I gotta warn them.

313
00:37:40.759 --> 00:37:43.094
Shit! You got a quarter?

314
00:37:47.223 --> 00:37:49.225
(Phone ringing)

315
00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:54.814
- Hello.
- "Janelle, it's me.'

316
00:37:55.023 --> 00:37:57.233
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

317
00:37:57.442 --> 00:37:59.736
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK."

318
00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:02.947
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine."

319
00:38:03.156 --> 00:38:06.618
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

320
00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:09.370
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

321
00:38:09.579 --> 00:38:10.997
I'm making beef stew.

322
00:38:11.206 --> 00:38:13.291
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

323
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.877
- John, where are you?
- (Dog barking)

324
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:18.838
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

325
00:38:19.047 --> 00:38:22.175
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

326
00:38:22.383 --> 00:38:23.718
The dog's really barking.

327
00:38:23.927 --> 00:38:26.012
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

328
00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:29.849
(Thud)

329
00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:32.685
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

330
00:38:32.894 --> 00:38:36.898
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

331
00:38:37.106 --> 00:38:39.275
(John's voice)
I'm right here. I'm fine.

332
00:38:39.484 --> 00:38:40.985
‘Are you sure you're all right?"

333
00:38:41.194 --> 00:38:43.988
- (Own voice) What's the dog's name?
- Max.

334
00:38:44.614 --> 00:38:46.825
(John's voice) Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

335
00:38:47.033 --> 00:38:49.494
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

336
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.372
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

337
00:38:53.706 --> 00:38:55.208
Where are you?

338
00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:58.878
Your foster parents are dead.

339
00:39:35.874 --> 00:39:37.876
No, no. I need a minute here.

340
00:39:38.084 --> 00:39:42.255
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

341
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.799
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

342
00:39:45.008 --> 00:39:46.801
Get real.

343
00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.638
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

344
00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:52.515
No, only an object of equal size.

345
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:55.143
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

346
00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:57.395
It can't form complex machines.

347
00:39:57.604 --> 00:39:59.564
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

348
00:39:59.772 --> 00:40:01.065
It doesn't work that way.

349
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:04.068
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

350
00:40:04.277 --> 00:40:06.279
Knives and stabbing weapons.

351
00:40:07.196 --> 00:40:09.532
(Weatherby) These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

352
00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:13.119
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

353
00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:17.540
He killed
17 police officers that night.

354
00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:21.294
Men with families...

355
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.255
...children.

356
00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:30.094
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

357
00:40:31.471 --> 00:40:35.391
(Weatherby) Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

358
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.856
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

359
00:40:42.065 --> 00:40:43.942
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

360
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.402
We know this guy's involved.

361
00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:51.449
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

362
00:40:55.828 --> 00:41:01.960
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- (Silberman) Sorry, guys.

363
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:04.671
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

364
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:06.381
as time goes on.

365
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:08.257
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

366
00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:12.136
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

367
00:41:12.345 --> 00:41:13.680
(Weatherby) Sure.

368
00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.641
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

369
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:17.934
(Douglas) Yes, sir.

370
00:41:19.602 --> 00:41:21.646
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

371
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:26.818
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

372
00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:32.573
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

373
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:33.992
running guns.

374
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.036
Then there were some other guys.

375
00:41:37.245 --> 00:41:38.997
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

376
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:42.417
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

377
00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:46.212
Then she gets busted.

378
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:49.924
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

379
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.178
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

380
00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:56.139
was all made-up bullshit.

381
00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.766
I hated her for that.

382
00:42:02.103 --> 00:42:04.731
But everything she said was true.

383
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.984
She knew.

384
00:42:10.236 --> 00:42:12.238
And nobody believed her.

385
00:42:14.073 --> 00:42:15.908
Not even me.

386
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:19.704
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

387
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:23.249
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

388
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:24.667
will be to copy Sarah Connor

389
00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:26.377
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

390
00:42:26.586 --> 00:42:28.546
Great. What happens to her?

391
00:42:28.755 --> 00:42:31.507
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

392
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.677
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

393
00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:37.013
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

394
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.223
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

395
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.936
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

396
00:42:44.145 --> 00:42:46.981
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

397
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.525
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

398
00:42:49.734 --> 00:42:52.653
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

399
00:42:52.862 --> 00:42:53.780
Let me go!

400
00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:02.080
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

401
00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:06.584
What?

402
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:13.382
You have to do what I say, huh?

403
00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:15.676
That's one of my mission parameters.

404
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:20.473
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

405
00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:24.018
Yes!

406
00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:29.816
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

407
00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:34.028
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

408
00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:38.658
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

409
00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.077
Dipshit?

410
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.123
Put your leg down.

411
00:43:45.331 --> 00:43:50.002
- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

412
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:52.463
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

413
00:43:52.672 --> 00:43:55.299
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

414
00:43:55.508 --> 00:43:58.553
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

415
00:43:58.761 --> 00:43:59.971
Get off mel

416
00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:07.311
- No!
- (Gunshot)

417
00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.857
Put the gun down, now!

418
00:44:11.065 --> 00:44:14.235
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

419
00:44:21.242 --> 00:44:23.077
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

420
00:44:23.286 --> 00:44:25.288
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

421
00:44:27.623 --> 00:44:30.168
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

422
00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:33.588
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

423
00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:35.882
You got that?

424
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.426
You just can't go around
killing people.

425
00:44:38.634 --> 00:44:39.510
Why?

426
00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:42.638
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

427
00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:43.681
Why?

428
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.559
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

429
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:56.068
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

430
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:59.697
And I order you to help me.

431
00:45:13.419 --> 00:45:15.630
(Operator on police radio)

432
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:07.640
Hm!

433
00:46:25.032 --> 00:46:27.868
(Clattering)

434
00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:30.538
(Clattering fades)

435
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:26.469
Hi!

436
00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:30.723
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

437
00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:33.184
They've been in there for an hour.

438
00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:35.728
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

439
00:47:37.605 --> 00:47:40.232
Oh, here come your friends now.

440
00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:50.910
(Buzzer)

441
00:47:59.919 --> 00:48:01.837
(Officer) Well, that was productive.

442
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.010
(Locks door)

443
00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:46.298
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- (Gwen) No, thanks.

444
00:48:47.049 --> 00:48:48.050
How 'bout a beer?

445
00:48:48.259 --> 00:48:49.677
Yeah, right!

446
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:17.204
- Hey, I got a full house.
- (Gwen) That's good, Lewis.

447
00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:19.331
Must be my lucky day.

448
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:44.690
(Thud)

449
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:46.669
(Groans)

450
00:51:42.016 --> 00:51:44.393
(Yawning) I think you're right
about number 24.

451
00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:47.313
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

452
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:49.732
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

453
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:05.914
(Groans) You!

454
00:52:10.252 --> 00:52:12.046
You broke my arm.

455
00:52:12.254 --> 00:52:14.840
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

456
00:52:15.049 --> 00:52:17.593
That's one. Now, don't move.

457
00:52:23.599 --> 00:52:25.267
What are you gonna do?

458
00:52:28.896 --> 00:52:30.939
Why do we stop now?

459
00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:35.986
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

460
00:52:36.195 --> 00:52:38.656
- Right.
- Swear?

461
00:52:38.864 --> 00:52:40.240
What?

462
00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:43.452
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

463
00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.499
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

464
00:52:55.673 --> 00:52:59.426
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

465
00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:01.762
(Gunshots)

466
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.514
(Groans)

467
00:53:03.722 --> 00:53:07.476
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

468
00:53:09.144 --> 00:53:10.604
You crazy bastard!

469
00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.152
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

470
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.739
(Guard groaning)

471
00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:22.449
He'll live.

472
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:26.912
(Engine roars)

473
00:53:33.794 --> 00:53:35.796
(Quiet conversation)

474
00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.299
Son of a bitch!

475
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:42.094
Let's try to remain calm.

476
00:53:42.302 --> 00:53:44.096
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

477
00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:46.223
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

478
00:53:46.432 --> 00:53:48.559
(Sarah) Open the door.
(Guard) It ain't gonna happen.

479
00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:50.602
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

480
00:53:50.811 --> 00:53:52.438
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

481
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:53.981
I don't believe you can do it.

482
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:55.441
You're already dead, Silberman.

483
00:53:55.649 --> 00:53:57.067
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

484
00:53:57.276 --> 00:54:00.904
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

485
00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.282
(Buzzer)

486
00:54:07.202 --> 00:54:09.413
Back off!

487
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:10.914
Get back!

488
00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:12.916
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

489
00:54:14.793 --> 00:54:16.336
Don't move!

490
00:54:17.671 --> 00:54:20.632
- Drop the shit!
- (Silberman) Do it! Do it!

491
00:54:21.216 --> 00:54:23.510
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

492
00:54:23.719 --> 00:54:24.803
Not you!

493
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:26.513
Open the door.

494
00:54:29.516 --> 00:54:31.769
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

495
00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:50.496
Get her! Get her!

496
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:53.499
(Alarm blares)

497
00:54:55.501 --> 00:54:57.544
(Alarm blaring)

498
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.273
Sarah!

499
00:55:18.482 --> 00:55:21.318
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

500
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:24.279
Let's go! Open it!

501
00:55:24.488 --> 00:55:25.280
Get the other door!

502
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:28.742
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

503
00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:36.458
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

504
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.048
(Panting)

505
00:55:52.975 --> 00:55:53.767
(Gasps)

506
00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:03.151
No!

507
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.695
(Screams) No!

508
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.741
- No!
- Mom, wait!

509
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.243
Mom!

510
00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:20.419
- Come back here!
- No! No!

511
00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.129
No!

512
00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:23.839
- Help her!
- Wait here.

513
00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.549
Hurry up!

514
00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:27.718
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

515
00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:29.011
Hold her.

516
00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:32.264
He'll kill us all!

517
00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:43.483
(Clank)

518
00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:56.163
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

519
00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:03.170
Come with me, if you want to live.

520
00:57:03.378 --> 00:57:05.589
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

521
00:57:30.405 --> 00:57:31.531
Go.

522
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.450
(Gunshot)

523
00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:36.870
(Gunshot)

524
00:57:38.372 --> 00:57:39.498
(Gunshot)

525
00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:43.335
(Gunshots)

526
00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:06.400
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

527
00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:16.118
(Thump)

528
00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:19.997
(Gunshot)

529
00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:22.666
Get down.

530
00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:26.586
(Gunshot)

531
00:58:29.923 --> 00:58:31.216
(Gunshot)

532
00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:36.847
(Gunshots)

533
00:58:39.266 --> 00:58:40.976
No! Mom!

534
00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:48.817
(Gunshots)

535
00:58:55.407 --> 00:58:57.034
(Tyres screech)

536
00:58:59.119 --> 00:59:00.495
Out of the car!

537
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:01.830
(Gunshot)

538
00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:03.081
Right now!

539
00:59:27.898 --> 00:59:29.566
Go!

540
00:59:39.993 --> 00:59:41.036
I'm out.

541
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:44.414
(Gunshot)

542
00:59:48.001 --> 00:59:49.753
- Come on.
- Here.

543
00:59:52.464 --> 00:59:54.382
(Terminator) Reload.

544
01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:05.310
Last one!

545
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.069
(Terminator) Hang on.

546
01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:41.680
Ready!

547
01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.603
John!

548
01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:57.320
Here, drive.

549
01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:02.659
(Gunshot)

550
01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:53.001
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

551
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.378
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

552
01:01:57.631 --> 01:02:00.926
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

553
01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:05.555
Cool.

554
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:10.852
Come here.

555
01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.610
I said I was OK.

556
01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.530
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

557
01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.784
God damnit! You have to be
smarter than that.

558
01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.452
You almost got yourself killed.

559
01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:30.413
What were you thinking?

560
01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:33.959
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

561
01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.502
Do you understand?

562
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:39.881
You're too important.
Do you understand?

563
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:43.885
But...

564
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.307
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

565
01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.894
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

566
01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.736
What's wrong with your eyes?

567
01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:05.240
Nothing.

568
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.544
So, what's your story?

569
01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.842
(Sirens wail, radios crackle)

570
01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.180
You OK?

571
01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:30.807
Fine.

572
01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.812
Say, that's a nice bike.

573
01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.961
(John) Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

574
01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:06.176
(Hissing)

575
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.764
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

576
01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:13.808
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

577
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:19.731
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient Killer, right?

578
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:20.982
Correct.

579
01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:29.032
Does it hurt when you get shot?

580
01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.453
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain".

581
01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.957
John, help me with the light.

582
01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:40.001
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

583
01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:44.631
Good. If you can't pass for a human,
you're not much good to us.

584
01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.801
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

585
01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.678
120 years
with my existing power cell.

586
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.723
Can you learn stuff that
you haven't been programmed with,

587
01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.600
SO you can be...

588
01:04:56.684 --> 01:05:01.189
...you know, more human,
and not such a dork all the time?

589
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:07.278
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

590
01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:11.199
The more contact I have with humans,
the more I learn.

591
01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.034
(John) Cool.

592
01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.022
(Engine starts)

593
01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:45.984
Are we learning yet?

594
01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:51.448
Mom!

595
01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.958
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

596
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.714
Just head south.

597
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:17.724
Keep it under 65.

598
01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.560
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

599
01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:26.274
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

600
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.903
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

601
01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.280
You say, “Mo problemo."”

602
01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:36.284
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

603
01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:40.622
And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."

604
01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:43.249
(Monotone) Hasta la vista, baby.

605
01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:46.002
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

606
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:49.005
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

607
01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:53.635
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

608
01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:56.471
That's great. See? You're getting it.

609
01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.598
No problemo.

610
01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:02.018
(Truck horn blasts)

611
01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:15.114
Want some of my fries?

612
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:28.920
- Need any help?
- No.

613
01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.507
- I got youl!
- No, you didn't!

614
01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.551
I did!
I came round here and I got youl!

615
01:07:34.759 --> 01:07:38.429
No, you didn't!

616
01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.432
We're not gonna make it, are we?

617
01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.478
People, I mean.

618
01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.483
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

619
01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:54.279
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

620
01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.365
(Woman) Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

621
01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:03.830
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

622
01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.500
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

623
01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.544
(John) Who is that?

624
01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:12.880
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

625
01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:17.802
Why him?

626
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.263
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

627
01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:21.723
of microprocessor.

628
01:08:22.473 --> 01:08:25.727
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

629
01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.895
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

630
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.355
of military computer systems.

631
01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:33.151
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

632
01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.694
becoming fully unmanned.

633
01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:38.031
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

634
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:40.617
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

635
01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:44.120
The system goes on-line
on August 4 1997.

636
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:47.248
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

637
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:50.168
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

638
01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:54.547
It becomes self-aware at 02:14am
Eastern time, August 29.

639
01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.051
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

640
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.596
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

641
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.307
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

642
01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.560
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

643
01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:10.021
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

644
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.023
will eliminate its enemies over here.

645
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.733
Jesus!

646
01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.321
How much do you know about Dyson?

647
01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.325
I have detailed files.

648
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:25.453
I wanna know everything.

649
01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:30.833
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

650
01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.072
Wait in the car.

651
01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:06.202
(Wind howling)

652
01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.509
Enrique!

653
01:10:21.718 --> 01:10:24.053
(In Spanish) Are you here?

654
01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:40.820
(In English)
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

655
01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:49.036
(Continues in Spanish)
And you... are always like a snake.

656
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.955
(Laughs)

657
01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.166
(In Spanish) It's great
to see you, Connor!

658
01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:54.417
I told you I would be back.

659
01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:57.336
(Enrique) I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

660
01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:58.379
Jolanda!

661
01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.799
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

662
01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:05.136
- Hey, big John. ;Cdmo te va?
- What's up?

663
01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.054
(Continues in Spanish)
Who's this big guy?

664
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:12.226
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

665
01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.270
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

666
01:11:14.479 --> 01:11:16.898
Uncle Bob, huh?

667
01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:19.984
(Laughing) OK. OKI!

668
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.445
(Continues in Spanish) How are you?

669
01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:25.948
How are you?
You've grown so much.

670
01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:27.658
(In English) Drink?

671
01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.206
Uncle Bob?

672
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:38.294
(Enrique) Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

673
01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:41.047
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

674
01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.966
(Laughing) Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

675
01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.677
(Indistinct dialogue in Spanish)

676
01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.012
I just came for my stuff.

677
01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.681
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

678
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:52.850
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

679
01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.561
Now, Enrique!

680
01:11:56.604 --> 01:12:00.399
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

681
01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.714
One thing about my mom...

682
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.677
...she always plans ahead.

683
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.188
Excellent.

684
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:45.736
(Indistinct dialogue in Spanish)

685
01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:48.197
(Tries to start engine)

686
01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:53.578
This is my best truck I got,
but the starter motor's gone.

687
01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.580
You got time to change it out?

688
01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:58.833
Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

689
01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.421
(John) See,
I grew up in places like this,

690
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:05.798
so I just thought
that's how people lived,

691
01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:10.511
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.

692
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.018
That's definitely you.

693
01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:31.240
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks,

694
01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:35.119
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

695
01:13:35.328 --> 01:13:38.497
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

696
01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.876
Mom screwed it up, of course.

697
01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.128
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

698
01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.714
and me being this world leader.

699
01:13:47.506 --> 01:13:51.510
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

700
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.014
Here.

701
01:13:56.057 --> 01:14:00.478
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

702
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:05.274
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

703
01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:09.737
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

704
01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:11.822
Man!

705
01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:15.826
He hasn't even been born yet.

706
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:19.538
It messes with your head.

707
01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.794
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

708
01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:35.179
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

709
01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:40.559
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

710
01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.186
She denies it totally, of course,

711
01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:45.189
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

712
01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:50.945
Why do you cry?

713
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.864
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

714
01:14:54.073 --> 01:14:56.534
I don't know. We just cry.

715
01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.829
You know, when it hurts.

716
01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:11.132
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

717
01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.301
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

718
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.928
- Get it?
- No.

719
01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:17.096
(Engine starts)

720
01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:18.889
All right, my man!

721
01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.309
- No problemo.
- Give me five.

722
01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.772
Just put out your hand, like this.

723
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:31.861
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

724
01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:34.113
(Slap) All right!

725
01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:36.198
(Groans)

726
01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.368
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

727
01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:41.620
Five low.

728
01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.330
(Laughs) Too slow.

729
01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.627
I'm just kidding. One more time.

730
01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.921
(Slap) Good. Now try it. Good!

731
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.882
Now do me. Give me five.

732
01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:56.594
(Sarah) 'Watching John
with the machine,

733
01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.971
it was suddenly so clear.

734
01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:02.141
'The Terminator would never stop.

735
01:16:02.349 --> 01:16:06.020
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

736
01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:09.648
'never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him

737
01:16:09.857 --> 01:16:12.151
‘or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

738
01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:17.907
'It would always be there

739
01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:22.661
'Of all the would-be fathers

740
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:27.208
'this thing, this machine,

741
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:32.630
'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

742
01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.949
(Dogs barking, children laughing)

743
01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:10.501
(Jolanda in Spanish)
Come here, darling.

744
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.547
(Baby laughs)

745
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:02.136
(Muted)

(Muted)

748
01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:12.479
Hey, let's try this one.

749
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.403
There we go.

750
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.169
(Muted)

751
01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.548
(Children scream)

752
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.682
(Screaming)

753
01:19:26.053 --> 01:19:27.680
(Laughter)

754
01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.053
(Enrique) She said you go south
with him like you planned.

755
01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:11.265
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

756
01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.225
Mom, wait!

757
01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.409
"No fate".

758
01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.954
"No fate, but what we make."

759
01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.750
My father told her this.

760
01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:45.341
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

761
01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:51.764
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

762
01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.600
The future's not set.

763
01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:58.228
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

764
01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:02.941
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

765
01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:06.111
Oh, shit!

766
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.113
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

767
01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:11.700
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

768
01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:13.786
She's gonna blow him away.

769
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:15.871
Come on! Let's go!

770
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.748
Let's go! Come on!

771
01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:31.512
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

772
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.474
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

773
01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:40.187
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

774
01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:42.773
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

775
01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:44.691
I don't care!

776
01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.693
Haven't you learned anything yet?

777
01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:49.071
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

778
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:57.704
(Woman) Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

779
01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:01.166
(Boy) Just a couple of minutes,
Mom!

780
01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.794
(Typing)

781
01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.844
(Mom) Danny, your time is up!

782
01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:14.847
Come brush your teeth and get to bed.

783
01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:18.016
(Typing)

784
01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:44.793
Danny!

785
01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:47.880
Ugh!

786
01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:52.050
(Automatic gunfire)

787
01:22:56.555 --> 01:23:00.309
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

788
01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.061
Miles?

789
01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.233
Miles!

790
01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:10.736
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

791
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.870
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

792
01:23:20.078 --> 01:23:21.205
Run!

793
01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.040
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

794
01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:44.478
- Daddy!
- Danny! Danny!

795
01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:48.190
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

796
01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:52.069
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

797
01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.029
Get out of the way.

798
01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.822
Don't hurt him!

799
01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.076
Get on the floor now!

800
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.830
Just let the boy go.

801
01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.875
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

802
01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.545
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

803
01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.880
- It's all your fault!
- What?

804
01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:14.091
I'm not gonna let you do it.

805
01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:33.860
Shhh!

806
01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:39.324
Shhh.

807
01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.562
(John) Shit! We're too late!

808
01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:13.775
Check them.

809
01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:20.991
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

810
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.493
Look at me.

811
01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:27.456
I almost...

812
01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.583
I almost...

813
01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:34.171
(Sobbing)

814
01:25:39.384 --> 01:25:43.430
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

815
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:46.725
I promise.

816
01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:55.776
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

817
01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:00.656
I love you, John.

818
01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:04.660
I always have.

819
01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.954
I know.

820
01:26:14.419 --> 01:26:16.463
Deep penetration.

821
01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.006
(Moaning)

822
01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.008
No shattered bone.

823
01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:23.011
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

824
01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:37.109
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

825
01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:44.449
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

826
01:26:57.504 --> 01:27:00.632
Oh, God! No!

827
01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.934
(Miles cries out)

828
01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.397
(Tarissa) Oh, my God!

829
01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.158
Oh, my God.

830
01:27:26.366 --> 01:27:28.827
Now, listen to me very carefully.

831
01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:34.624
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

832
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:38.879
(Sarah) 'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

833
01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:42.674
‘Skynet. Judgment Day.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:45.927
"The history of things to come.

'He took it pretty well.'

838
01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.982
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

839
01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:10.076
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

840
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:16.458
How were we supposed to know?

841
01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:20.170
Yeah!

842
01:28:20.378 --> 01:28:21.880
Right.

843
01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:25.884
How were you supposed to know?

844
01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:29.679
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

845
01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:34.100
Men like you thought it up.

846
01:28:37.896 --> 01:28:40.941
You think you're so creative.

847
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:44.194
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

848
01:28:44.402 --> 01:28:47.989
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

849
01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:50.450
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

850
01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.035
Mom!

851
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.623
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

852
01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:58.792
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

853
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.710
But I thought...

854
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.757
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

855
01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:09.511
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

856
01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:12.389
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

857
01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:16.184
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

858
01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:19.396
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

859
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:24.317
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

860
01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:28.947
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

861
01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.617
Everything. I don't care.

862
01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:35.412
The chip.

863
01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.581
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

864
01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.291
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

865
01:29:39.499 --> 01:29:40.750
It must be from
the other one like you.

866
01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:45.338
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

867
01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.133
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

868
01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:50.552
Those lying motherfuckers.

869
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.429
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

870
01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:54.764
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

871
01:29:54.973 --> 01:29:56.349
but it gave us ideas,

872
01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:59.436
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

873
01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:03.690
All my work was based on it.

874
01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:05.567
It must be destroyed.

875
01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:10.864
Can you get us in? Past security?

876
01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.992
I think so, yeah. When?

877
01:30:18.038 --> 01:30:18.997
Now?

878
01:30:23.251 --> 01:30:25.921
(Sarah) 'The future,
always so clear to me,

879
01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:29.049
'had become
like a black highway at night.

880
01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:34.804
‘We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

881
01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:14.761
(Miles) Hi. Er... Carl, right?

882
01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:18.348
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

883
01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:19.599
Hi!

884
01:31:20.016 --> 01:31:21.893
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

885
01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:25.271
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

886
01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.482
I need written authorisation...

887
01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:32.404
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

888
01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:44.916
(Miles) Come on. It's OK.

889
01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.711
It takes two keys to open the vault.

890
01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:49.504
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

891
01:31:49.713 --> 01:31:52.382
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

892
01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:55.260
Gibbons?

893
01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:03.184
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

894
01:32:05.478 --> 01:32:06.730
Gibbons!

895
01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:09.524
Oh, shit.

896
01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:12.902
(Beep)

897
01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:20.493
(Silent alarm)

898
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.544
My card should access this.

899
01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:30.795
(Buzz)

900
01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.048
(Buzz)

901
01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:35.383
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

902
01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:38.428
The silent alarm's been tripped.

903
01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.353
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

904
01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:51.149
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

905
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.818
No.

906
01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:58.698
We go all the way. OK?

907
01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:04.662
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

908
01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:06.289
I think it's that guy from the mall.

909
01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:07.415
It is!

910
01:33:07.624 --> 01:33:09.793
It's him and the woman.

911
01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:13.963
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

912
01:33:16.549 --> 01:33:19.803
(Miles) I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

913
01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.265
(Buzz)

914
01:33:24.474 --> 01:33:26.643
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

915
01:33:31.898 --> 01:33:33.858
John, fire in the hold!

916
01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:50.708
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

917
01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:53.711
(Alarm blaring)

918
01:33:58.007 --> 01:34:00.343
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

919
01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.097
Put this on.

920
01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:20.613
(Sarah) All right, let's get to work.

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.428

Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

- You got it?
- Yeah.

Yeah!

John! Stay down!

1001
01:49:07.499 --> 01:49:08.959
- Aagh!
- Mom!

1002
01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:51.001
Hello?

1003
01:49:57.091 --> 01:49:59.176
Goddamn! You all right...?

1004
01:50:06.725 --> 01:50:08.685
Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1005
01:50:11.188 --> 01:50:12.940
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1006
01:50:15.067 --> 01:50:15.859
- Agh!

1007
01:50:16.985 --> 01:50:18.195
Are you hurt?

1008

- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

Here. This'll work.

1015

He's gaining.

1016

- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1017
01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:23.135
I can run faster than this!

1018

Coming up, to the right.

Watch it! Watch it!

1020
01:52:01.715 --> 01:52:03.467
- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1021
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:12.893
Take the off-ramp.

1022
01:52:22.945 --> 01:52:23.737
Shit!

1023
01:52:27.783 --> 01:52:28.659
Hold on!

1024
01:53:14.663 --> 01:53:15.455
Don't stop!

1025

Go straight!

1026
01:53:27.467 --> 01:53:28.927
- Look out!
- Duck!

1027
01:53:44.192 --> 01:53:45.694
Get the hell outta here!

1028
01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:54.328
Get outta here! Let's go!

1029
01:53:54.536 --> 01:53:55.787

1030
01:54:29.446 --> 01:54:31.365

1031
01:54:39.247 --> 01:54:40.665
(Shattering)

1032
01:55:11.530 --> 01:55:13.698
Hasta la vista, baby.

1033
01:55:14.991 --> 01:55:16.284

1034
01:55:34.928 --> 01:55:37.347
(Groans)

1035
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:04.749
We don't have much time.

1036
01:56:27.856 --> 01:56:28.648
Let's go.

1037
01:56:29.941 --> 01:56:31.485
Come on, Mom.
We gotta get outta here.

1038
01:56:31.693 --> 01:56:33.653
Come on! Get up!

1039
01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:48.960
(John) Hand me the shotgun.

1040
01:56:53.924 --> 01:56:56.051
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1041
01:56:57.135 --> 01:56:58.762
Hurry!

1042
01:57:02.474 --> 01:57:03.975
Come on, Mom.

- Agh!
- Come on, Mom. Get up! Come on!

1044
01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.751
This way. Come on.

1045
01:57:41.179 --> 01:57:43.723
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1046
01:57:43.932 --> 01:57:45.058
(John) Go back.

1047
01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.527
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1048
01:57:56.152 --> 01:57:57.612
John, you've got to go now.

1049
01:57:57.821 --> 01:57:59.823
- John!
- Go! Now!

1050
01:58:00.031 --> 01:58:01.366
No!

1051
01:59:14.648 --> 01:59:16.274
(Sarah) Get up the steps.

1052
01:59:18.276 --> 01:59:19.444
Go on.

1053
01:59:25.909 --> 01:59:27.911
Come on, Mom.
I got you. Come on.

1054
01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.312
No!

1055
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:04.781
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1056
02:00:06.157 --> 02:00:08.785
Grab it. Go. Go!

1057
02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:22.424
Mom, come on! Mom! Mom!

1058
02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:24.092
Come on!

1059
02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:26.594
Mom!

1060
02:00:26.803 --> 02:00:28.972
Mom! Mom! Mom!

1061
02:01:05.049 --> 02:01:06.468
Agh!

1062
02:01:12.098 --> 02:01:13.016
Call to John.

1063
02:01:15.018 --> 02:01:16.144
No!

1064
02:01:16.686 --> 02:01:17.896
I know this hurts.

1065
02:01:18.897 --> 02:01:21.357
- Ugh!
- Call John.

1066
02:01:38.792 --> 02:01:40.710
Call to John now.

1067
02:01:42.837 --> 02:01:44.130
Fuck you!

1068
02:02:47.235 --> 02:02:49.445

1069

1070
02:04:55.947 --> 02:04:59.492
(Sarah) John? John!

1071
02:05:00.868 --> 02:05:03.079
John? Help!

1072
02:05:05.832 --> 02:05:07.208
John!

1073
02:05:11.004 --> 02:05:12.672
John?

1074
02:05:15.008 --> 02:05:16.342
John!

1075
02:05:18.469 --> 02:05:19.679
John.

1076
02:05:20.638 --> 02:05:22.140
John.

1077
02:05:24.726 --> 02:05:26.352
- Mom.
- Help me.

1078
02:05:27.645 --> 02:05:29.397
Help me.

1079
02:05:30.940 --> 02:05:31.941
Help me.

1080
02:05:32.150 --> 02:05:33.276
Get out of the way, John.

1081
02:05:33.484 --> 02:05:34.360
Shoot!

1082
02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:46.247
(Gunshot)

1083
02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:50.209

1086
02:06:18.112 --> 02:06:19.530
Mom!

1087
02:06:29.290 --> 02:06:30.750
Get down!

1088
02:06:32.794 --> 02:06:34.045

1089
02:06:40.009 --> 02:06:42.929

1091
02:06:55.942 --> 02:06:57.693
(Unearthly screams)

1092
02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:03.950
No!

1093
02:08:05.136 --> 02:08:07.346
Get up. Come on.

1094
02:08:09.557 --> 02:08:11.100
Holy shit!

1095
02:08:11.309 --> 02:08:12.977
I need a vacation.

1096
02:08:21.277 --> 02:08:23.654
(Furnace bubbling)

1097
02:08:27.491 --> 02:08:31.162
- Is it dead?
- Terminated.

1098
02:08:34.707 --> 02:08:36.292
Will this melt in there?

1099
02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:41.130
Yes. Throw it in.

1100
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.844
Adios!

1101
02:08:48.888 --> 02:08:51.057
And the chip.

1102
02:09:02.443 --> 02:09:03.945
(Fizz)

1103
02:09:05.529 --> 02:09:06.948
It's over.

1104
02:09:09.492 --> 02:09:10.534
No.

1105
02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:15.456
There's one more chip.

1106
02:09:20.461 --> 02:09:22.421
And it must be destroyed also.

1107
02:09:28.094 --> 02:09:29.470
Here.

1108
02:09:29.679 --> 02:09:33.683
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1109
02:09:39.313 --> 02:09:40.856
No.

1110
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.942
No.

1111
02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.698
- I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
- No!

1112
02:09:48.906 --> 02:09:50.908
No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.

1113
02:09:51.117 --> 02:09:52.994
- It'll be OK.
- I have to go away.

1114
02:09:53.202 --> 02:09:55.663
No, don't do it. Please, don't go.

1115
02:09:55.871 --> 02:09:58.624
- I must go away, John.
- No!

1116
02:09:59.292 --> 02:10:00.376
No, wait.

1117
02:10:00.584 --> 02:10:03.337
- You don't have to do this.
- I'm sorry.

1118
02:10:04.505 --> 02:10:06.549
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1119
02:10:07.008 --> 02:10:08.551
It has to end here.

1120
02:10:09.885 --> 02:10:13.055
I order you not to go!
I order you not to go!

1121
02:10:13.264 --> 02:10:14.765
I order you not to go!

1122
02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:23.065
I know now why you cry.

1123
02:10:25.568 --> 02:10:27.737
But it's something I can never do.

1124
02:11:02.855 --> 02:11:04.440
Goodbye.
