1
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:03,672
There you go.

2
00:00:03,673 --> 00:00:05,382
Thanks.
Appreciate it.

3
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:07,076
You got it.

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,035
Check her out.

5
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:13,822
What, do you think
she's on your team?

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,041
We'd be lucky to have her.

7
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,144
Is it just me,
or have there been, like, tons

8
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:20,962
of hot girls
everywhere lately?

9
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,681
I can't say.

10
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:24,816
My senses
have been dulled

11
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:27,185
by years of monogamy.

12
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:29,438
My hormones
are going nuts.

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,989
I've officially
crossed over

14
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:32,774
from the nausea stage
of pregnancy

15
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:33,942
into the horny stage.

16
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:35,277
Nauseous then horny...

17
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:38,029
That's the reverse
of Audrey's process.

18
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,499
I'm serious, man.

19
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,117
- I'm going crazy.
- Well...

20
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,586
Too bad you can't do anything
about it.

21
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,588
Who says?

22
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:51,092
I can't believe we have
to have this conversation.

23
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,577
We're paying you
to be our surrogate.

24
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,296
So, as long as
our kid's in there

25
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:57,716
that whole area
is closed for business.

26
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,769
Uh, you are not the boss
of my business.

27
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:02,921
Well, actually,
for the next five months, I am.

28
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,273
Um, just think of it
as a, uh,

29
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,559
crowded night club...
No one new gets in

30
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:09,728
until someone comes out.

31
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,564
All right.
Well, before you install

32
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:15,167
a velvet rope and a bouncer
down there...

33
00:01:15,169 --> 00:01:17,202
I mean, it's not
really an issue.

34
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:19,788
With your giant-headed baby
inside me,

35
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,940
I don't know who'd be
into me anyway.

36
00:01:21,942 --> 00:01:24,659
It is pretty unappealing,

37
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,878
although...

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,215
The upper deck's
never looked better.

39
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:31,666
I know, right?

40
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,802
I'm kind of
turning myself on.

41
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,221
Speaking of which,
time for another drink.

42
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:46,965
with the rack over there?

43
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,234
She's been
checking you out.

44
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:50,886
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:50,888 --> 00:01:53,104
- You should send her a drink.
- Good call.

46
00:01:53,106 --> 00:01:55,023
Can I send some white wine
to the woman over there?

47
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:58,142
She looks more like
a scotch, beer kind of gal.

48
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,164
Hey, you know what would be
a class move?

49
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,201
Send over some nachos.

50
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,988
You're
the cheapest man alive.

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,343
Cheap like a fox.

52
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,598
Oh, don't forget her nachos.

53
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:45,129

54
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:52,801
here you go...
Double whiskey.

55
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:55,138
Enjoy your breakfast.

56
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:57,706
Mm, thank you.

57
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,742
Is this one of those, uh,
<i>leaving Las Vegas</i> things,

58
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:02,160
where you take a look
at your life

59
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,996
and decide to drink yourself
to death?

60
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,415
She asked hopefully.

61
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:09,634
No, I'm getting
a wisdom tooth pulled today,

62
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:11,953
- and I'm prepping.
- Hmm.

63
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:15,223
Um, excuse me, could I get
a side order of fruit?

64
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:19,794
No need...
We got the melons right here.

65
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:20,979
I know, right?

66
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,315
I've got, like,
the biggest boobs in the world.

67
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:32,524
All right, grow up,
Russell.

68
00:03:32,526 --> 00:03:34,326
That is just...
That's nature's way

69
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:35,977
of preparing for the baby.

70
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:37,079
More like nature's way

71
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:40,198
of preparing me
to pound one out.

72
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,334
Well, I got to go.

73
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:45,537
- Hey, where you going?
- Uh, to meet a new friend.

74
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,456
It's the, uh, waitress
from the bar the other night.

75
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,790
Wait.
When did that happen?

76
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,175
Um, after you
got kicked out

77
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:53,495
for trying to get that guy
to buy me a surf and turf.

78
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:56,498
She and I...
We had a nice little chat,

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,134
- and, uh, I got her number.
- Really?

80
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,770
Even after she saw
that whole mess?

81
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:06,024
Also known as our child.

82
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:07,559
She didn't seem to have
a problem with it.

83
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,444
So we are seeing a movie
at the Alexandria.

84
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,146
- Huh.
- Ooh, interesting.

85
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:14,232
You know,
the Alexandria is uptown.

86
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,618
After the film,
might the two of you

87
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,904
be heading
in the opposite direction?

88
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:23,858
Stayed an extra 30 seconds,
paid the price.

89
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,079
Brenda and a waitress?
Russell likey.

90
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:30,165
Nothing's going to happen.
I made that clear last night.

91
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,334
Her area is off-limits.

92
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,470
Jeff,
Brenda is a grown woman.

93
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:38,390
Whatever she does with
her "area" is her decision.

94
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:42,561
And if she and her friend
would like me to film it...

95
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,680
Again, her call.

96
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:48,066
Oh, my God.
You are disgusting.

97
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,734
You are like a cockroach.

98
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,020
Hmm. Pardon me?

99
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:53,905
What kind of roach?

100
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,911
Uh, in my defense,
this is not my first one.

101
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:08,787
Oh, hi, Barbara.

102
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:09,871
Hi, Lily.

103
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:12,457
Oh, isn't she so cute?

104
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:13,925
You know,
I'm having a baby soon.

105
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:15,510
Oh, congratulations,
Audrey.

106
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:16,545
When are you due?

107
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,296
Oh, no, no.
I'm not having it.

108
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,248
We're actually using a friend of
my husband's as our surrogate.

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,434
But it's not weird or anything.
She's a lesbian.

110
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:24,920
Mommy,
what's a lesbian?

111
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:28,473
Thanks. I've been meaning
to explain that to her.

112
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,142
Sorry.

113
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,311
Oh, that is such a nice doll
you have there.

114
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:34,429
What is her name?

115
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,148
- Dolly.
- Well...

116
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,483
It is very nice

117
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,453
- to meet you, dol...
- Mommy!

118
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,905
Crap! I mean, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:45,123
- Here, I'll fix her.
- That's okay.

120
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:47,075
Now we... now we're going
to take her

121
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,610
to the doll hospital,
okay?

122
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:50,629
Yes, yes.

123
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:53,248
I am going to take her
to the doll hospital.

124
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,782
I'm going to take her there
right now.

125
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:57,385
Watch me go,
here I go.

126
00:05:57,387 --> 00:06:00,589
No, there's an actual hospital
at the doll town store.

127
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,224
That's where they have to go
to be repaired.

128
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,725
- Oh, seriously?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,844
Oh, okay. I'll... I'll take
her there for you.

130
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:09,648
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

131
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,132
No problem,
no problem.

132
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:12,734
I'll have her back to you
this afternoon, good as new.

133
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:13,802
Okay, bye-bye, Lily.

134
00:06:22,078 --> 00:06:23,662
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

135
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:27,315
Hey, Jen, um,
you remember when you said

136
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,651
that I wasn't a tough,
edgy kind of guy?

137
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:33,838
Yes. You were wearing
an avocado exfoliating mask.

138
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,742
Yeah, and I glowed
for a week.

139
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:42,130
Well, take a look
who is tough and edgy now.

140
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,165
Huh?

141
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,520
Wha... no... wha...
Are you... are you scared?

142
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,439
You scared,
yet a little turned on?

143
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:53,675
You got a tattoo
because I said

144
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:55,193
- you weren't edgy?
- Oh, yeah.

145
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,896
It's temporary, yo.

146
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:01,917
- Why barbed wire?
- Because...

147
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,618
It's forbidden.

148
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,153
It's not forbidden.

149
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:07,038
You can buy it
at the hardware store.

150
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,873
Yeah, but they keep it
behind the counter,

151
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,710
and you have to
ask the guy.

152
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:14,579
Plus, the real one's going
to have even sharper barbs.

153
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,365
Come on, please,
don't get a real one.

154
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,052
That's the wrong thing
to say to a rebel, baby.

155
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,755
Now I only want to do it more.

156
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:36,318
Gallant is such a wuss.

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,272
Goofus... that's the guy
you want to be.

158
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:43,358
Sir, Goofus is eating
all the cookies himself,

159
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,727
leaving none for anyone...
You know what?

160
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,779
I'm not having
this argument again.

161
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,583
What's up your tepee,
geroni-mope?

162
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:54,836
Hmm. Seems
like appropriate gratitude

163
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,288
for making me
give up my saturday

164
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,905
to babysit you
at the dentist.

165
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,425
Really? What else
would you be doing...

166
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:03,178
Sitting at home,
reading a book about glasses?

167
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:09,250
Yes. I'm farsighted
and deserve contempt for it.

168
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:13,138
Hey. Hello.

169
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,390
Uh, just to confirm...
We will be using

170
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:17,942
all available sedatives on me?

171
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,729
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

172
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,480
There's a switch.

173
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:26,034
A woman giving <i>you</i>
knockout drugs.

174
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:32,073
What... what are you doing?

175
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:35,710
What Goofus would do.

176
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,948
But she just said you were
getting a sedative, sir.

177
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,135
Hey, I'm having
a wisdom tooth out.

178
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,120
It's major surgery.

179
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,006
It's not like your country,

180
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,391
where they just line you up

181
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:53,595
and have a goat
kick you in the mouth.

182
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:01,736
I can't believe it costs
50 bucks to fix a doll.

183
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:04,322
Soon it will be a real baby.

184
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:07,709
Kind of a nice way to practice
taking care of one.

185
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,804
Hold the door!

186
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,362
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Here! No, no.

187
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:12,030
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

188
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,160
Don't worry...
Not real.

189
00:09:26,162 --> 00:09:28,096
Oh, my heart's
pounding, too, bro.

190
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:39,023
Uh, no. Honestly, I didn't
think you were going to call.

191
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:40,191
Well, I'm glad I did.

192
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:41,393
Me too.

193
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,062
Oh, my God!
You guys are here, too.

194
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:47,348
- Oh, my God.
- Jeff, what are you doing here?

195
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,902
Are you kidding me?
I'm a huge fan of this crap.

196
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,854
You just try keeping me away

197
00:09:52,856 --> 00:09:54,856
from "an Icelandic
woman's tale

198
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:57,125
of unrequited love
and redemption"...

199
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:01,379
- Subtitled.
- You're going to hate this.

200
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,798
You said <i>the expendables</i>
was too think-y.

201
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,799
They weren't expendable.

202
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,201
They were very necessary
to the operation.

203
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:09,838
Uh, you remember Andrea
from the other night?

204
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,139
I do, and, um...

205
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,391
Regarding my tip, um,

206
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:17,145
I did not expect
to be seeing you again.

207
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,880
Well, don't worry about it.

208
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:20,214
I'm going to go
get us some popcorn.

209
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,150
- Great.
- Extra butter.

210
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:25,687
Okay, what the hell
are you doing here?

211
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:27,439
I said
no monkey business...

212
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:28,890
Not until after
the baby is born.

213
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:30,442
We discussed this
at the bar.

214
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:33,077
Look, I'm on a date, okay?

215
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:34,896
And I would like for it
to go well.

216
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:37,449
Oh. I don't want it
to go at all.

217
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:40,168
Well, that's not your call.
So beat it.

218
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,753
No, no, no.
I'm not going anywhere.

219
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:43,621
I'm staying right here.

220
00:10:43,623 --> 00:10:46,541
To do what? To try to prevent
me from hooking up?

221
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,294
Are you actually trying
to beaver-dam me?

222
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:55,082
Uh, yeah.
The velvet rope is up.

223
00:10:55,084 --> 00:10:56,217
I'm the bouncer.

224
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:58,102
And your little
waitress friend...

225
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,921
Not on the list.

226
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:02,140
- Jeff...
- Want to go in?

227
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:04,809
Yeah, let's do this.

228
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,952
Whoa!

229
00:11:16,822 --> 00:11:19,073
Thank you so much.
Uh, I'll take him from here.

230
00:11:19,075 --> 00:11:19,992
Here we go, sir.

231
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:21,743
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

232
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,298
- He can't eat for an hour.
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,133
Oh, and he shouldn't lift
anything heavy.

234
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,589
What did he say?

235
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:37,258
He said,
"not lift anything heavy?

236
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,627
How am I going to pee?"

237
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:47,151
Right.
Now, give him more aspirin

238
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:48,853
if it starts
to swell or throb.

239
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:52,106
If it starts...
If it starts to...

240
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:54,993
Perhaps we should just go.

241
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,034
So...

242
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,469
Did you enjoy the film?

243
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:06,955
I did. I did. I actually
found it pretty moving.

244
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:08,506
Good.

245
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,125
Those ugly people
sure seemed fired up

246
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:12,760
about the wheat harvest.

247
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:15,346
So you want to get
something to eat?

248
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:16,998
- Yeah, I would love to.
- Oh, me too.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,384
I'm starved.
I could eat that moose

250
00:12:19,386 --> 00:12:22,103
that kept popping up
in that farmer's dream.

251
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:24,138
Oh, Jeff, look,
Audrey's texting me.

252
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,940
She says she needs you
home right away.

253
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:28,309
Oh, wait.
Uh, she just texted me, too.

254
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:29,844
"Ignore the text
I sent Brenda.

255
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,679
Stay out as late
as you like."

256
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:34,032
Where are we going?

257
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:35,850
There's a chinese place
across the street.

258
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:36,735
Aren't you vegan?

259
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,352
Yeah, but
I can make it work.

260
00:12:38,354 --> 00:12:40,939
No, no. No.

261
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,741
Let's go get vegan food!

262
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,127
How does that sound, Jeff?

263
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:51,332
Sounds like a love letter
to my colon.

264
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:54,135
Let's eat.

265
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,753
Yes.

266
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,205
Thank you so much for drooling
on my favorite sweater.

267
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:01,059
I suppose I can just have my
grandmother knit me another...

268
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,344
From the grave.

269
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:09,216
Oh!
None of that!

270
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:13,021
Okay, sir, we're here.

271
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:15,389
Hmm? What's that?
An offer to pay?

272
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,910
Oh, no, please, let me.

273
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,278
Thank you.

274
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,565
I'll come round
and get you, sir.

275
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:30,588
Oh!
Oh, dear.

276
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,599
Two trips to the doll hospital
in one day...

277
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,568
That's got to be a record.

278
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,770
Oh, things happen,
just like in life.

279
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,823
But a good mom
learns from her mistakes,

280
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,242
isn't that right, Dolly?

281
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,293
Hello?

282
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,246
Oh! Oh, God!

283
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,614
Hello?

284
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,430
Ah, yes.
Uh, hello.

285
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,132
Um, I'm trying
to locate an item

286
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:13,635
I left in one
of your cabs.

287
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:18,473
Valuable?
No, it's my boss.

288
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,493
Yes, I'll hold.

289
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,362
That thing is wrecked.

290
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,830
Just buy a new one.

291
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,915
Look...

292
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,084
Her head is just
a little bit caved in, okay?

293
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,819
I think if I pry her eye out,

294
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,339
I can pop her head out
from the inside.

295
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:37,659
I like her that way.
I think she looks badass.

296
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:38,961
Oh, yes.

297
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,629
Uh, thank you.

298
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,164
His height?

299
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:44,349
Hmm, well, I know
he's not tall enough

300
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,136
to ride the matterhorn
at Disneyland.

301
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,838
He moped in the teacups
for hours.

302
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,023
Hair color, did you ask?

303
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,258
Well, that would be
nice 'n easy number 46.

304
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,310
Eye color?

305
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,512
Black?

306
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,148
I've never seen his eyes.

307
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,683
He's always staring
at my boobs.

308
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:04,686
Is beady a color?

309
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:07,072
Look, if you find
a drunken troll

310
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:11,410
making crude sexual innuendoes,
please do call us.

311
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,829
Well, I better get going.

312
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:17,466
I got an appointment
to go ink the guns.

313
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:19,835
All right, that's it.

314
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,370
Ow! Ow!
Why'd you do that?

315
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,006
Well, if you think
that hurt,

316
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:28,143
imagine an electric needle
stabbing you for hours.

317
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:30,929
Hours?

318
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,483
Yes.
And there's blood.

319
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:35,901
Mine?

320
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,355
Yeah, lots of it.

321
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:44,443
I think I'm just going
to grow, like, a badass 'stache.

322
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,579
Oh, yes!

323
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,703
I think it's time
to talk to her

324
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,072
about the big Dollhouse
in the sky.

325
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:05,013
- Oh, that was so good.
- I know.

326
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,883
Jeff, how was your meal?

327
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,768
Nothing better
after Icelandic cinema

328
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,521
than mung beans
and a shamburger.

329
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:15,524
Really? 'Cause it looks like
you barely touched it.

330
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:19,645
I'm saving room for dessert...
Carob pudding.

331
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,231
It's getting kind of late.
I guess...

332
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:24,700
Everyone's going to go
their separate ways.

333
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,451
So, Andrea, share a cab?

334
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:29,271
Actually, um,
I was going to ask Andrea

335
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:30,789
if she wanted to come back
to my place,

336
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,174
maybe have a glass of wine?

337
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:36,328
- Oh, sure. I'd love to.
- Well, I'm in. This...

338
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,282
Kale shake's not doing it.

339
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:43,218
It's doing something.

340
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,806
No, Jeff, I meant
just me and Andrea.

341
00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:51,126
Oh. I will walk you,
make sure that

342
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:53,228
you two delicate flowers
get back safely.

343
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,564
I served
in the Israeli army.

344
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,399
Ah...

345
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,184
The middle east...

346
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,905
There's a topic we could bat
around till the wee hours.

347
00:17:02,907 --> 00:17:05,190
Okay, Jeff,
I'm just going to step in here.

348
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,994
I really think that it
is time for you to go.

349
00:17:08,996 --> 00:17:10,329
Okay, come on,
what's... what's going on?

350
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:12,447
All right, Andrea...

351
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,366
She's not a lesbian.

352
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:18,003
She and I are...
We're a thing.

353
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,856
That's right... I put that baby
in there the old-fashioned way.

354
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:23,959
And she loved it.

355
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:28,597
Oh, my God.
Look, Jeff here is worried

356
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,499
that if something physical
were to happen

357
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,835
between you and me,
that it might interfere

358
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:36,504
with the baby that I am
just carrying for him.

359
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:39,007
Oh. Well,
maybe I should go.

360
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:41,777
- Oh, that'd be great.
- No, stay.

361
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,313
Jeff, first of all...

362
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,598
And I really mean this...

363
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,133
You're an idiot.

364
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:51,053
- That's a little harsh.
- No, it's not.

365
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:53,538
Oh, hey, brah.
Yeah,

366
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,024
that carob pudding's
for you, man.

367
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,525
Go eat that in your van.

368
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:00,045
Oh, God.

369
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,546
Jeff, please.

370
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,465
We have known each other
forever.

371
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,300
Do you really think
that I would do anything,

372
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:07,920
even for a second, that could
possibly harm this baby?

373
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:11,539
- I guess not, no.
- Okay.

374
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,892
Then I ask you... no...

375
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:17,545
I beg you... go.

376
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:20,716
Maybe we should let
Andrea decide...

377
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:22,234
Go!

378
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,486
All right, I will,
but you know what?

379
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:25,821
Not before I say this,
all right?

380
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:28,607
If you guys are going
to start up with the horseplay...

381
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,660
Brenda,
you can go nuts on her,

382
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,028
you know, but, Andrea,

383
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,548
when it's your turn
to do stuff, just don't.

384
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,284
Is he serious?

385
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,586
Oh, yeah, I pull that
on Audrey all the time.

386
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,590
Just pretend you fell asleep.

387
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:52,681
And yet,
Audrey is still straight.

388
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,683
Really proves
it's not a choice.

389
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:55,884
Mm-hmm.

390
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,520
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

391
00:18:58,522 --> 00:19:01,273
Okay,
this is your building.

392
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,926
Your friend is on his way
to meet you.

393
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:07,229
Why don't we
just stay right here

394
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:09,281
until he arrives?

395
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,732
You're the best, Timmy.

396
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,485
Oh, sorry, sir,
I'm not, uh...

397
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:16,154
You know what?
You're right.

398
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,657
I don't thank you enough.

399
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:23,328
Truth is, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

400
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,381
You're really my best friend.

401
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:29,284
I love you.

402
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:32,337
Thank you so much.
I'll take him from here.

403
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,172
This is for you.

404
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,174
All right, sir.

405
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,759
Let's get you home.

406
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,962
When did you
start driving a cab?

407
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:44,266
Ah, yes.
We all look alike.

408
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,068
Very original.

409
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,602
Anything nice
you'd like to say to me, sir,

410
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,355
considering I've given up
my entire saturday for you?

411
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,108
Hmm? No?
Didn't think so.

412
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,037
So you actually thought you
could talk them

413
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
- out of getting together?
- I know, right?

414
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,591
I'm generally arguing
the pro side

415
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:06,423
of two chicks hooking up.

416
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:08,952
Where are you
making this argument?

417
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:11,564
Wherever it needs
to be made.

418
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:16,352
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

419
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:20,240
Listen...

420
00:20:20,242 --> 00:20:23,193
Let's... let's just see
if Jeff and Audrey think

421
00:20:23,195 --> 00:20:25,078
this 'stache
makes me look edgy.

422
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,798
It doesn't.
You look like a '70s porn star.

423
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,784
Yeah, well,
from what I understand,

424
00:20:31,786 --> 00:20:33,503
those guys
got tons of tail.

425
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:37,924
Okay? Now, just don't...
Don't tell them it's fake.

426
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:40,343
They saw you yesterday!

427
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,715
What's up?

428
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:48,918
