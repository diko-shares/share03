00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.580
Remember Me (2010)

3
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180
I know, but it's coming.

4
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.740
When is it?

5
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.700
It's not gonna be too much longer.

6
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.580
Spit your gum out.
Come on. Thank you.

7
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.540
Oh, here comes the train!

8
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.580
Get behind me.
Ally, stay behind me.

9
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.820
Just take it. Take it.

10
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.060
Give me your purse. Give me your purse.

11
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.300
- Give me the ring!
- What?

12
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.900
- Don't talk.
- It's gonna be okay.

13
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.540
- Ally, don't look at them. No, no...
- Better not, lady.

14
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.500
<i>This is the Coney Island-bound F train.</i>

15
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.580
<i>Next stop Avenue I.</i>

16
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.540
No!

17
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.060
Mom! Mom!

18
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.500
Mom! Mom! Mom!

19
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.300
Mom! Mom!

20
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.980
Mom!

21
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.580
Daddy!

22
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.300
Hello?

23
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.300
Fifteen minutes.

24
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.460
- How are you, Mom?
- You look good.

25
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.780
- How you doing, Les?
- Good to see you.

26
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.740
Thanks for the wake-up call, Maestro.

27
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.620
You smell like Listerine and beer.

28
00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.820
You couldn't wear a tie?

29
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.780
I could have.

30
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.620
This is nice. Michael would like

31
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.100
that we still do this.

32
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.900
Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said
about your portrait?

33
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.060
Mom!

34
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.540
Tell him!

35
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.380
She said I captured the moment
like a young James Whistler.

36
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.100
Well, at least
it's a young James Whistler,

37
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.580
because, God, I mean, Whistler,
he fell off in the latter half of his career.

38
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.580
He is the Boyz II Men
of European art history.

39
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.340
She recommended your sister
to Steinhardt's Summer Art Intensive,

40
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.420
- and that's hugely prestigious.
- It's fantastic.

41
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.580
It's great.

42
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.620
I'm going to do a drawing called
"My Brother and His Favorite Cigarette."

43
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:15.220
And, since I'd be the youngest person ever,
practically, to be studying there...

44
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.380
Tyler,

45
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.860
would you please pass the sugar?

46
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.980
She still has a couple of minutes left
on the clock, Dad.

47
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.940
Just a couple of seconds.

48
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.020
Caroline's perfectly capable of speaking up
if she's feeling slighted in any way.

49
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.620
Have I slighted you in any way, Caroline?

50
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.900
I'm fine.

51
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.660
- I didn't mean to change the subject.
- What was the subject?

52
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.820
Excuse me?

53
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.220
The subject we were discussing.
What was it?

54
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.140
Now is not the time for your heroics, Tyler.

55
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.660
Actually, now is the perfect time.

56
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.460
- All right. I gotta go.
- Tyler.

57
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.660
Caroline, do you want me
to take you anywhere?

58
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.740
- I'm okay. I'll stay with Mom.
- All right. I'll see you soon.

59
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.060
The sugar.

60
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.700
Eat something.

61
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.980
<i>Gandhi said that</i>
<i>whatever you do in life will be insignificant,</i>

62
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.140
<i>but it's very important that you do it.</i>

63
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.220
<i>I tend to agree with the first part.</i>

64
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.780
<i>Michael, you know what day I'm staring at.</i>

65
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.260
<i>By 22, Gandhi had three kids,</i>

66
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.500
<i>Mozart, 30 symphonies,</i>

67
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.820
<i>and Buddy Holly was dead.</i>

68
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.340
<i>You once told me,</i>

69
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.140
<i>"Our fingerprints don't fade</i>
<i>from the lives we touch."</i>

70
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860
<i>Is that true for everybody?</i>

71
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.900
<i>Or was that just poetic bullshit?</i>

72
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.700
I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.

73
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.260
- You sold my who? What?
- You know, your girlfriend.

74
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.380
That voluptuous,
delightfully oblivious little blonde

75
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.660
you left in your bed yesterday?

76
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I sold her a toothbrush.

77
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.700
I got three bucks.

78
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.580
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, are in order.

79
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.140
'Cause that sale inspired
our newest business venture.

80
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.660
The S.L.U.T.

81
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.820
It's a Single Lady's Universal Tote.

82
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.780
It's a one-night-stand travel pack
for women. You know?

83
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.740
We throw in makeup and toiletries,
a cell phone charger, cab numbers...

84
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.820
We retail it for $19.95.
Maybe we'd do an infomercial.

85
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.060
Do you think women will buy this
with actual money?

86
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.900
Okay. Yeah.
You know what? Fine. Be cynical.

87
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:17.660
But think about it, at one point in history,

88
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.500
two people had a conversation,
a lot like this one, about the light bulb.

89
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.060
One went on to fame and fortune,

90
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.900
the other probably went to work
at Mickey D's or something.

91
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.740
In the wake of recent terrorist attacks,

92
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.820
do you guys think there's a place
for a discussion about ethics

93
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.380
when we're talking about
the root causes of terrorism?

94
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.300
Wasn't it a moral question,
not an ethical one?

95
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.740
- How so?
- Well, morals define personal character.

96
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.820
And ethics?

97
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.900
The standards of behavior expected
by a group.

98
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.420
And in the end,
personal character is more important?

99
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.060
- Absolutely.
- That's a good point.

100
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.020
Does knowledge of the past
limit us or benefit us?

101
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.220
Can we make this
a non-smoking statue?

102
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.500
Yeah, Tyler.
Can we make this a non-smoking statue?

103
00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.260
- You promised you'd quit.
- I know.

104
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.020
Why do you think Dad
doesn't wanna listen to me?

105
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.700
- Dad loves you.
- So?

106
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.220
You can love someone
and not want to spend time with them.

107
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.940
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Mom loves Aunt Sara.

108
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.020
But at Christmas last year,

109
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.580
she wouldn't let Les leave them
in a room together

110
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.460
'cause she said that there'd be
a "Yuletide homicide."

111
00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.180
That's 'cause Aunt Sara drinks.
You don't drink, do you?

112
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.420
I'm 11.

113
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.460
So why would anyone ever want
to avoid you?

114
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.820
Michael used to drink.

115
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.660
That's 'cause Michael was 21.

116
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:10.300
When you're 21, drinking's new
and exciting, and everybody does it.

117
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.420
Aunt Sara drinks
'cause she wishes she was 21.

118
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.780
You're 21.

119
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.140
Okay.

120
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.220
Hey, what about Atlantic City
for your birthday this year, man?

121
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.220
- Really?
- Yeah. We'll get a suite.

122
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.700
You could call Toothbrush Girl.

123
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.500
I think I'd rather be sodomized
with a toothbrush than that.

124
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.980
It's your day, man.
We can work something out.

125
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.060
The schematic for these particular shelves

126
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.460
is of authors who have slept together
and ended up dead or in prison.

127
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.220
No shit?

128
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.420
Shit.

129
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.980
See, that's why chicks dig you, man.

130
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.700
No, seriously.
They love this freaky poetic crap.

131
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.140
Oh! I ran into Megan yesterday.

132
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.940
She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight, man.
Wants us to stop by.

133
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.820
She practically begged me.
Yeah, poor thing.

134
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.700
Hey!

135
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.380
- Hey!
- "Hey," nothing, man! What's...

136
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.660
What?

137
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.020
All right, look, you've been a ghost
the past couple of weeks, all right?

138
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.100
You never wanna go out anymore.

139
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.340
I've had enough
of this brooding introvert shit, okay?

140
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.700
I'm ready to set up an intervention here.

141
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.860
What?

142
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:40.100
You do realize that interventions
typically don't involve binge drinking.

143
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.460
Look, one drink.

144
00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.940
- Okay? Just one.
- When was the last time you had one drink?

145
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.220
Communion.

146
00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.700
Megan! Megan. Wow! You look great!

147
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.620
Do not speak.

148
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.020
Okay. Two beers?

149
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.020
Is she mad at me or something?

150
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.620
She's not mad. That's how people act
when they're really into you.

151
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.420
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

152
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.460
Oh!

153
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.620
- Hello. Excuse me. Hi.
- Could you get a picture for us?

154
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.580
Yeah, sure. I just push the button?

155
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.780
- Turn it...
- You gotta go the other way.

156
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.340
Beautiful.

157
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.420
Save that for your collection.

158
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.140
So, what are you girls drinking?

159
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:32.660
Mojitos!
Mojitos!

160
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.620
No, no, no, I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with any other city.

161
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.340
I'm just saying that this
is the greatest city in the world.

162
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.020
All right? I love this street!

163
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.020
I love this street! Where are you guys from?

164
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.620
- Miami.
- Miami.

165
00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.820
That was great. You did it in unison.
Miami. That's a big suck fest.

166
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.140
No, this is the greatest city.
I don't know, like Barcelona, Rio,

167
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.500
- they got nothing on this town.
- What are we doing? I'm freezing.

168
00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.420
- Hotel bar.
- Michael!

169
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.540
Yeah.

170
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.740
- Should have worn a coat.
- Michael!

171
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.500
It's warm in here.
Get your hands off my car!

172
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.500
What's your problem, asshole?

173
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.260
- You'd be warmer if you snuggle up.
- Asshole!

174
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.460
What the hell?

175
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.700
- Get back in your car.
- Yeah?

176
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.260
- What?
- Go back to Long Island

177
00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.940
- where you come from.
- I'm from Queens, asshole!

178
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.260
Shut the hell up, Yank.

179
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.500
Why don't you go back
to England, huh?

180
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.340
Hey, you wanna go back
to my hotel room?

181
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.460
- That's my bloody guitar!
- Eat shit and die!

182
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.940
Whoa!

183
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.220
- Tyler...
- This is messed up.

184
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.500
- I'm gonna go.
- Tyler!

185
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.020
Let's go...
Lauren! Where are you going?

186
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:42.900
- Come here!
- Don't walk over there.

187
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.140
- Get off me!
- Lauren!

188
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.340
Get off of me!
Oh, my God!

189
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.460
Get off of me!

190
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.380
Come on, now! Right now!

191
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.820
Hold him down!

192
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.620
No, I really think that it's done.

193
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.700
- It's not bleeding as much.
- Here you go, ma'am.

194
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.660
I hate New York!

195
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:08.060
Listen, Officer, those two were with us.
They were just trying to stop it.

196
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.700
Leo. Cut those two loose.

197
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.700
Curly, turn around.

198
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.900
- Anything in here gonna stab me?
- Nope.

199
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.340
Get out of jail free.

200
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.180
You're very, very lucky my partner
is on a tear.

201
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.180
- How about you two?
- It wasn't us, man.

202
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.700
- Take a hike.
- That scumbag kicked my car!

203
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.900
- Shut up, genius.
- Eat shit, wanker!

204
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.740
All right! That's it! Everybody's going!

205
00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.300
- What? You're bloody shitting me!
- Come on!

206
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.220
- Hey! Hey!
- They attacked us!

207
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.500
These two didn't do anything.

208
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.500
- It was everything was these assholes.
- Hey, star witness, shut up!

209
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.020
What are you still doing here?

210
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.820
This is bullshit. These two guys
were just walking across the street.

211
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.060
Well, Mr. Hawkins,
what makes you think I give a shit?

212
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.060
'Cause you're a cop.

213
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.420
- You're supposed to give a shit.
- You hear that, Leo?

214
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.740
That's a great relief to me, Mr. Hawkins,
to know that you're on top of the situation.

215
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.500
Now, go home!

216
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.420
- Take a hike, fellas.
- Why don't you...

217
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.540
What...

218
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:24.340
Hey, pretty boy,
you ready to grab your ankles?

219
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.900
Come here, sweet potato.

220
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.140
You can have your call now.

221
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:33.100
No, I'm good. I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

222
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.020
- You all right?
- You're good?

223
00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:37.980
You're good?

224
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.700
Okay. Now, thank God you're good.

225
00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.620
'Cause I wouldn't want you to get upset
about anything, like being in jail.

226
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.020
I wouldn't want you to worry about that.

227
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.620
You want to tell me what you were doing?

228
00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.580
I would like to know. You wanna tell me
what you wanted from that cop guy?

229
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.620
Nothing. It was just a messed-up situation.
I mean...

230
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.700
Yeah, I'll say.
It was frigging stupid, is what it was.

231
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.580
These guys, you know, they're just pussies.

232
00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.420
You pussies!

233
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.060
That's great. That's good.
Okay, Green Hornet... Lantern.

234
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.860
Asshole!

235
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.740
You know what? You might actually
be having a nice time

236
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.540
not matriculating in school.
But I actually would like to graduate.

237
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.060
It must be nice living
at the bookstore by yourself

238
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.660
with all your stacks of books and all that,

239
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.380
but, see, I actually plan on having a career,
and a wife, and a girlfriend,

240
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.820
and, I don't know, a divorce

241
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.580
and a mid-life stalking episode,
and erectile dysfunction.

242
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.660
- Little bitch!
- Shut up!

243
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.940
Faggot!
Asshole!

244
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.060
- So I will thank you, as a friend...
- Shut up!

245
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.540
...to keep your complexes
and your nihilistic bullshit to yourself!

246
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.540
- Did you just say "nihilistic"?
- Yeah! All right? I got it off a cereal box!

247
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.420
Hawkins. Hall.

248
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.500
- Oh, you...
- Yeah.

249
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.780
I called your dad. Sue me.

250
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.860
- Good boy.
- We didn't do anything!

251
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.820
Hey, nice to meet you.

252
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.700
Is she looking for a roommate?

253
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.660
In the city?

254
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.100
Really?

255
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.980
Hey, I gotta go, but I'll call you back.

256
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.540
Okay. Bye.

257
00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.340
So, what'd you tell me
you were gonna do when things got tight?

258
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.780
What, breathe?

259
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.180
- Did you?
- I did. I'm breathing right now.

260
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.460
- Who was that?
- Marie.

261
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.020
Oh.

262
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.900
- How is she?
- She's good.

263
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.500
Mrs. Lippman's gonna drive me.

264
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.140
No. I'll drive you.

265
00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.420
Hey.

266
00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.340
This drive is too long.

267
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.780
You know you can't smoke in here.

268
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.140
Why do you have an ashtray?

269
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.580
It's a bowl. It completes the room.

270
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.220
Good morning,
Hawkins, Stevens, Jacob.

271
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.380
This is a bowl?

272
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.580
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Tyler.

273
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.700
I guess it was just here to tease me.

274
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.420
- Hey, Janine.
- He's ready for you.

275
00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

276
00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.260
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Janine.

277
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:04.700
You look like hell,
and you smell like beer and cigarettes.

278
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.340
- Thank you.
- You want me to lie to you?

279
00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.940
Try not to give him a heart attack.

280
00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.260
I only came to see how much it cost.
I'm gonna pay you back.

281
00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.740
- How much what costs?
- The lawyer.

282
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.780
Ah.

283
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:30.540
That lawyer, Tyler, costs $450 an hour.

284
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.220
Oh, for Christ sake.

285
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.660
Tell me about it.

286
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.460
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't call you.

287
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.020
It wasn't me.

288
00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.900
You could do worse than have
a father who bails you out of jail.

289
00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.020
That's not even...

290
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.620
I don't want to be
bailed out of anything.

291
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.460
I'll get an invoice from Janine.

292
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.900
Hey, Michael,

293
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.100
<i>remember that Greek myth you read to me</i>

294
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.420
<i>about the god who banished</i>
<i>all his children to the underworld,</i>

295
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.500
<i>and how his youngest son,</i>
<i>to get even, castrated him with a sickle?</i>

296
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.660
<i>It's a little excessive, maybe,</i>

297
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.700
<i>but I get it.</i>

298
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.820
You're so weird.

299
00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.340
Caroline, we have to go
to surgery right now.

300
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.180
What did you do to your face?

301
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.900
I had a horrible threshing accident.

302
00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.220
- It was horrible.
- It was so horrible.

303
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.260
- The worst.
- You're so retarded.

304
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.700
Hey, I got you something.

305
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.900
This is my favorite book, ever.

306
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.340
Michael used to hit me over the head
repeatedly with it until I read it.

307
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:21.340
It's about all these gods and goddesses
who go around acting jealous and petty,

308
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.580
and otherwise like regular human beings.

309
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.300
- Illustrations are pretty cool.
- Yeah. These are cool.

310
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.740
Thanks.

311
00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.420
Uh...

312
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.260
- Where are we meeting Mom?
- The Guggenheim.

313
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.140
What's up with these girls?

314
00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.100
They think I'm weird.

315
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.380
Sometimes I sort of space out.

316
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.820
What, when you're drawing?

317
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.460
Yeah. Other times, too.

318
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.180
Mademoiselle Fleishman had
to snap her fingers at me a lot today,

319
00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.020
and everybody laughed.

320
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.740
They all think I'm a freak of nature.

321
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.740
Mademoiselle Fleishman.

322
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.340
Ma petite soeurette, une freak of nature.

323
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.380
French toast.

324
00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.180
What are you gonna tell Mom
about your face?

325
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.660
- "I finally found something I'm good at"?
- Really?

326
00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.140
I have a class now.
I know.

327
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.820
- Are you listening? I have a class now.
- I know

328
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.500
by all numerical measurements,
I didn't pass.

329
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.780
But I was hoping that maybe you could
give me a grade on my trying-to-pass,

330
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.060
my commitment to effort. It's...

331
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.180
My commitment to commitment. You know?

332
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.060
I don't... Look, I'm not... I mean...

333
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.220
- Patricia. Can I call you Patricia?
- No.

334
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.940
I... Life is about people and...

335
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.180
And it's about what people put into people.
And I wanna put something into you.

336
00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.940
And I... Not... I don't wanna...

337
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.420
I won't put anything into you. I just wanna...
You look great. I love that jacket.

338
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.220
I will... I will say you're an angel, Patricia!
An angel!

339
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.660
He has got a daughter!

340
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.300
- Who's got a daughter?
- The cop!

341
00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.980
The cop that busted your face all up.
He's got a daughter.

342
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.500
What do you want me to do? Kidnap her?

343
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.460
Of course not!
We don't have closet space for that.

344
00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:29.100
Just introduce yourself.
You know, go on a few dates. I don't know.

345
00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.540
Be your charming, gentlemanly self,
and then flip the script on her.

346
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.620
- What's "flip the script"?
- Screw her brains out.

347
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
Make her call you Daddy, I don't know.

348
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.100
Just steal her panties
and sell them on eBay,

349
00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.620
or post them on her high school's
home page.

350
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.300
I don't know. Just be creative.

351
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.820
Yeah, you should be incarcerated
just on general principle.

352
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.380
- I was incarcerated. You might remember?
- Yeah.

353
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.940
You tell me you don't wanna get back
at this asshole, and I'll drop it.

354
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.140
Where's the trash?

355
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.140
I don't wanna get back at this asshole.

356
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.940
- Just meet her.
- I don't wanna meet her.

357
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.620
- She's cute.
- I don't care.

358
00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.180
- You're meeting her.
- No, I'm not.

359
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.540
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

360
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.740
Are, too.

361
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.100
Look, just meet her.

362
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.380
This is one of those things
that I'm already regretting.

363
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.060
All right, she was here the other day.

364
00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.300
I don't care. What do you want me to say?

365
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.700
"Hey, doll face, your dad trampled
all over my civil liberties.

366
00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.540
"You wanna make out with me?"

367
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.780
Don't call her "doll face"!

368
00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.260
Moron.

369
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.140
- Look, I'm leaving.
- Would you...

370
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.300
Look. All right, there she is.

371
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.340
- Who?
- The blonde.

372
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.100
I know her. She's...

373
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.100
I don't know her,
but she's in my global politics class.

374
00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.180
There you go! Something to open up with.
All right?

375
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.820
Go get her.

376
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.420
Excuse me? Can I bother you for a sec?

377
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.220
You're already bothering me.

378
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.100
Listen, I'm doing
this sociological experiment,

379
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.460
and I was just wondering
if you could help me out for a second.

380
00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.580
You're kidding me, right?

381
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.180
Can I ask your name?

382
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.540
Anonymous.

383
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.340
Anonymous. Is that Greek?

384
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.420
Okay, Anonymous,

385
00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.340
you see the guy sitting over there,

386
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.620
pretending to read a textbook,
looking in this general direction?

387
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.060
Yeah, he's staring at us. Subtle.

388
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.100
I have this theory that an objective
third party such as yourself

389
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.780
could determine how much of an asshole
he is just by looking at him.

390
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.700
See, I'm his roommate, and I think
I've witnessed too many glaring examples

391
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.180
of assoholic behavior
that I'm biased as a subject.

392
00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.380
But I'm convinced that he has an aura
that you can actually perceive.

393
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.460
Who else do you plan on asking?

394
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.140
I don't know. I don't think anybody else
here fits the criteria.

395
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.860
Attractive, early-twenties female...

396
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:14.380
- Ah! Nineteen.
- Nineteen. I'm...

397
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.740
That's fine. Teens. I can do teens.

398
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.420
Okay.

399
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.060
Well, typically, you get something
for being involved in one of these surveys.

400
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:31.820
I ran out of my foam fingers
a while back, so...

401
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.380
I don't know,
can I take you out to dinner or something?

402
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.540
Or maybe just have a conversation
on the off-chance

403
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.020
one of us says something interesting?

404
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.580
Yeah, see, there is a problem, though,
because I don't date sociology majors.

405
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.540
Lucky for you, I'm undecided. So...

406
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.860
About what?

407
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.940
Everything.

408
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.820
I'm Ally.

409
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:11.180
Ally.

410
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.180
Don't be mad!

411
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.060
Dad, we've seen Erin Brockovich
twice already. You cried both times.

412
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.420
- I did not.
- It's embarrassing.

413
00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.700
- Hello?
- Hello.

414
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:45.740
<i>- Hey, it's Tyler.</i>
- Hi.

415
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.020
You're gonna stand me up. I can feel it.

416
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.900
I can feel it in my bones.
I'm gonna be devastated.

417
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.220
No, no... I was just...

418
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.460
What? You were sitting around
watching TV in your sweatpants?

419
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.100
No, I'm not watching TV.

420
00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.620
I am just getting dressed
and I'm gonna meet you at the place at...

421
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.460
- What time again?
<i>- 8:00.</i>

422
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.100
Right. 8:15. Okay.

423
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.820
Remind me.
Erin Brockovich.

424
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.620
<i>Car accident. Not her fault, she says.</i>

425
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.620
Hey, I'm going out.

426
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.940
I can see that.

427
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.700
Well, you are a trained investigator.

428
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.900
- Who are you going with?
- A boy from school.

429
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.140
Okay.

430
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.060
- I wasn't asking for permission.
- I know. Just have a good time.

431
00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.460
You want cab fare?

432
00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.540
Should I wait up?

433
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.300
What desserts do you have?

434
00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.980
Mango ice cream with nuts and raisins.

435
00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.420
Great. I'll have that
and a glass of skim milk.

436
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.220
And then the lamb vindaloo. Thanks.

437
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.300
Can I have a chicken tikka masala
and a Kingfisher, please?

438
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.700
I have my dessert first.

439
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.740
Oh!

440
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.980
Is that a political statement?

441
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.580
Or a medical condition, perhaps?

442
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.340
I just don't see the point in waiting.
What if I die eating my vindaloo?

443
00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.660
- Is that probable?
- It's possible.

444
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.820
Embolism bursts,
asteroid hits the restaurant.

445
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.700
I'd die without having eaten
the one thing I wanted most.

446
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.580
- I mean, the odds are...
- Tell you what. Guarantee me,

447
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:19.980
swear to me on your eternal soul
that I make it through my entrée,

448
00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.900
and I'll wait.

449
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.580
Before you answer, if I die,

450
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.180
you're gonna have to live
the rest of your life knowing

451
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.860
not only did you lie to me,

452
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.060
but you denied me
of my one last indulgence.

453
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.100
My last wish.

454
00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.340
Are you prepared to shoulder
that kind of responsibility to prove a point?

455
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.860
Don't worry. I'll share.

456
00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.020
I had a nice time.

457
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.020
Yeah?

458
00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.420
You had a nice time,
or you're having a nice time?

459
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.900
'Cause if you're having a nice time,
why rush to end it?

460
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.020
Take a shot. Three for one. $1.

461
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.540
Okay, come on. Win a prize.
Win a prize for the pretty lady.

462
00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.060
Yeah. I want the panda.

463
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:17.060
How many do you need to get
for the panda?

464
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.100
Three for three.

465
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.540
- Let's go.
- I knew that.

466
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.180
Almost.

467
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.540
Yeah. Give me three more.

468
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.460
If I give up,

469
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.260
he wins.

470
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.220
- Who? The attendant?
- The giant freaking panda.

471
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.940
Take it easy, tough guy.

472
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.140
I'm sorry. All right, three more. Three more.
Let's do it.

473
00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:46.420
That's another $1.

474
00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.460
Yeah, I don't know
what you're smiling about.

475
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.980
I won.

476
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.100
Paying off the attendant is not winning.
It's cheating.

477
00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.260
By the way, when were you gonna tell me
what the hell happened to your face?

478
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.220
I just got into a bar fight.

479
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.340
Do you want to go for a beer or something?

480
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.420
No, wait, you can't. You're too young.

481
00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.620
I'm 21.

482
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.020
No, you're not. You're...

483
00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.340
Did you lie?

484
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.460
- I was trying to get rid of you.
- Oh.

485
00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.540
That hurts. I'm wounded.

486
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.900
Well, it's getting pretty late, so...

487
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.380
I'll walk you to the subway.

488
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.020
I'll take a cab.
I never take the subway anyway.

489
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.300
Okay.

490
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.660
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

491
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.700
So...

492
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.700
Uh...

493
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.900
- Not tonight.
- Okay.

494
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.460
Not never, just not tonight.

495
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.980
- Are we going or what?
- Turn on the meter.

496
00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.140
"Not never"?

497
00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.780
So dessert first, for fear of asteroid, yes,

498
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:30.060
but kissing a guy
you seem to be attracted to, at least,

499
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.380
before driving off
into the unknown New York City night

500
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.540
alongside a panda you only just met, no?

501
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.340
Great.

502
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:48.940
Good.

503
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.980
- You're really weird.
- Yeah, I know.

504
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.860
I'm going to Queens.
Don't wanna hear about it.

505
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.100
<i>Hello, this is Jackie Mason. Buckle up...</i>

506
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.500
- Happy end of 6th grade!
- Finally.

507
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:25.060
I got into that art program summer thing
at Steinhardt.

508
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.300
Yeah, I heard.

509
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.260
It's very prestigious,
due to my artistic greatness.

510
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.460
Mmm...

511
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.260
Don't pretend you're not proud.
You should be.

512
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.340
- There's, like, a thing.
- A thing?

513
00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:48.460
A show where you show
what you've done and stuff.

514
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.340
Will you come?

515
00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.740
Um...

516
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.340
I'll have to check my book.

517
00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.260
Abso-freaking-lutely. What, are you insane?

518
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:03.940
I'm gonna be there the day before.
I'm gonna camp out.

519
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.500
Your school's over, right?

520
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.420
Mom and Les are gonna get
the beach house again?

521
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.100
Yeah.

522
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.140
- What are we gonna do for your birthday?
- Nothing.

523
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.700
- Can we have a party?
- No.

524
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.540
A little one. At Mom's, with Aidan.

525
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.820
- I'll make Mom behave. No crying.
- Like that's even possible.

526
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.180
I know. We live like pigs.

527
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.100
But

528
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.900
I do have a coaster, if you want a coaster.

529
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.420
Don't do coasters till the third date.

530
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.740
Hey, who's that?

531
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.620
That's Michael. That's my brother.

532
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.820
He kind of looks like you.

533
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.140
- Does he play around here?
- Not anymore.

534
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.140
Do you play?

535
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.140
Well, it depends who you ask.

536
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.940
It turns out that you need talent.

537
00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.220
So, what talents
do you actually possess, Tyler?

538
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.020
Not a lot. I, uh...

539
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.180
I used to do a bit of falconry
when I was a kid.

540
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:45.100
I mean, I come from a long line
of Irish falconers.

541
00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:46.820
No, there is...

542
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:47.900
Oh!

543
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.540
I don't know if this qualifies
as a talent, but...

544
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.540
- What is that?
- This

545
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.100
is our appetizer.

546
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:01.100
I mean, it used to say,
"In case of Asteroid,"

547
00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.860
but Aidan, my roommate, got high,
and I was in the shower.

548
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.620
So...

549
00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.260
What kind of grade
did you get from Vogelstein?

550
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.060
I don't really get grades.

551
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.300
I'm not technically enrolled.
I just worked out this auditing thing.

552
00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.420
Huh.

553
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:32.140
So the Strand isn't a significant
career choice, either?

554
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.340
No, I just like the books.

555
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.020
What are you doing?

556
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.220
- You don't need to help me.
- Yeah, well, at the rate you're going,

557
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.060
dishwashing's gonna be,
like, your life's vocation.

558
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.300
What?

559
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:51.740
Huh.

560
00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.660
So, this is the whole playful
"you get me all wet" part, right?

561
00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.100
- Why make it sound cheap?
- It is cheap. I've seen this scene 100 times.

562
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.340
You know what never happens
in this scene, though,

563
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.300
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go-to-school?

564
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.380
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-
care-about-his-job?

565
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.100
- What?
- Nope?

566
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.900
That.

567
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.140
You better apologize!

568
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.180
- Never!
- Apologize!

569
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.460
Your middle name is Keats?
God, your parents are pretentious as hell.

570
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.940
- You better apologize.
- Never!

571
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.420
- Apologize!
- I'd rather eat monkeys!

572
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.300
Oh, God. Not in the plans! Not in the plans!

573
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.580
I surrender. I surrender. Jeez.

574
00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.980
You're relentless.

575
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.540
- Victory at all costs.
- Oh, man...

576
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.940
Now I'm pissed.

577
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.700
You should quit anyway.

578
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.780
Why is that?
Are cigarettes bad for you or something?

579
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.340
Do you want a sweatshirt or something?

580
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.940
I'm okay. Thanks.

581
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.780
You know, the only time I ever smoked
was at the roller disco at the Y.

582
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.300
I choked so bad,
Mr. Demmick gave me the Heimlich.

583
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.900
On skates?
That's actually quite impressive.

584
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.740
I never really thought of it that way.

585
00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:52.260
Tattoo, huh? Let me see. What is it,
like a Chinese character or something?

586
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.980
'Cause I know this guy
who got a Chinese character,

587
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.460
and he thought it said...

588
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.220
Sorry. I didn't know.

589
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.660
He killed himself.

590
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:19.700
When?

591
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.060
On his 22nd birthday.

592
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.580
He'd just started working for my father.

593
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.740
I thought he was a musician.

594
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.260
Yeah, he was.

595
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:44.500
But he wasn't making any money. And

596
00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.180
my dad's a pretty compelling guy.

597
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.940
Yeah. So is mine.

598
00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.900
- Damn, you're not naked!
- You're not Irish.

599
00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.700
What the hell happened in the kitchen?

600
00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:07.140
It looks like somebody's water broke
in there. It's gross.

601
00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.180
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.340
Aidan, this is Ally.

603
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:17.140
- Ally, Ally...
- Ally, Aidan. This is my roommate.

604
00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.340
Nice to meet you.

605
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.060
- I work out.
- You're the assoholic.

606
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.740
Yeah. Well, I...

607
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.980
Wait. What?

608
00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.500
Okay, "Around The World" party, third floor.
Come on, let's go.

609
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.660
There's a whole lot of ugly,
but there's a lot more alcohol, so...

610
00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.500
Come on, let's go.

611
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.260
Yeah, I would, I'd love to,
but I should get home.

612
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.740
What? No, no, no.
All right, listen, listen, listen.

613
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.340
Ally? Ally, Ally?

614
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.300
One drink.

615
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.900
Any country you want.
I'll even put France on the table.

616
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.820
Come on. And then we'll go.

617
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.700
One drink?

618
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.620
- One drink?
- One drink.

619
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.020
How are we doing?

620
00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.500
What?

621
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.340
What? What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

622
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.140
You want me to apologize
for showing a nice girl a good time?

623
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.580
- I'm sorry.
- Tyler,

624
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.220
I need you to call my dad.

625
00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.820
Yeah, sure. Where's your phone?

626
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.180
Ally, your phone's dead.

627
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.140
Ally?

628
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.500
What's his number?

629
00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.260
God damn.

630
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.940
Do you think I give a shit how late it is?

631
00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:07.660
I know she's a smart girl, Leo.
She's supposed to be back. She's not back.

632
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.620
Leo, don't go there. All right?

633
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.780
I want... I want you to call Ted Proferes!

634
00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.940
Yeah. And call me back.

635
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.260
God damn it, just do it!

636
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.820
Oh, shit.

637
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:08.980
Shit!

638
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.980
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

639
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.980
Asleep where?

640
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:50.900
My phone died, so...

641
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.740
- That's mine. That's from my desk.
- I was trying to find some information.

642
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.940
What am I now, one of your suspects?

643
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:01.620
When you act like one.
Are you on anything?

644
00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.580
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Don't use that tone with me, Ally.

645
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.340
I smell alcohol.

646
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:09.460
Yeah, so do I.

647
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.580
What's going on here, Ally? Are you trying
to tell me something with this?

648
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:16.300
You're all grown up now?

649
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.460
Yeah, maybe it's time you get used to it,
Dad, before you give yourself a heart attack.

650
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.980
Who's the guy?

651
00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:25.420
- God, what makes you think there's a guy?
- Yeah, he's a real prince.

652
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.780
He gets you drunk,
sends you home smelling like a brewery,

653
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.900
smelling like God knows what.

654
00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:35.660
- You sure can pick them.
- Yeah, I take after my mother.

655
00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.140
- I'm not a child, okay?
- Hey! In this house, you are!

656
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.060
You'd love that!

657
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.580
You're pathetic! Would you strangle me
'cause you couldn't save Mom...

658
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.220
Ally? Ally?

659
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.220
Don't touch me! Don't...

660
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.900
So, what? She just left? No goodbye?

661
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.020
You were the one dumping
Jell-O shots down her throat.

662
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.540
Hey, there are sins of omission
and sins of commission.

663
00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.060
I've forgiven myself, okay?
You should do the same.

664
00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.300
All right, here we go.

665
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.860
Come on! Come on!

666
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:34.700
Here we go! Here we go!

667
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.860
Got it! Okay!

668
00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.140
Okay... Don't think I can...

669
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.180
Crushing!

670
00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.980
It's crushing! I need a little help here! Tyler!

671
00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.660
- What the hell, man?
- It's penance.

672
00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:52.620
I'm going to work.

673
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.300
Help!

674
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.540
Well, if you had another one
of those protein shakes...

675
00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:00.780
Yeah, but it was freaking
crushing my sternum, you jackass.

676
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.460
Hey.

677
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.500
How's she doing?

678
00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:19.980
She's pretty shaken up.

679
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.740
We need to fix that deadbolt.

680
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.940
Yeah. That's my bad.

681
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:32.140
Don't worry about it.
Do you think she's gonna sleep?

682
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.060
You know, you realize
if she'd had the S.L.U. T...

683
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.380
Is it too soon?

684
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.260
I told her she can stay here.
Is that all right?

685
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.980
- Yeah. As long as she needs.
- Thank you.

686
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.300
You're up.

687
00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:37.900
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

688
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.860
Aidan left.

689
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.860
So, yeah, I'll be in here
if you need something.

690
00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.100
Thanks, honey. See you later.

691
00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.940
I can't believe you still come down here.

692
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.860
I can't believe he still drinks that stuff.

693
00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.980
Well, you know how it goes.
You can take the kid out of Brooklyn...

694
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.940
You're not writing anything bad about me,
are you?

695
00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.500
Not today.

696
00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.100
I gotta run. Early meetings.

697
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:21.180
In case I don't see you before Saturday,

698
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.180
happy birthday.

699
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:27.380
I'll tell your father you said hello.

700
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.580
Bye, doll.

701
00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.700
Bialy.

702
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:37.980
Thank you.

703
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.060
- Hey.
- Hey.

704
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.860
- Where you been?
- Downtown, near Wall Street.

705
00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:52.860
- Why?
- I went to a coffee shop.

706
00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:55.980
I got you a bialy.

707
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.580
Thanks. Yeah.

708
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.140
You realize New York's
full of coffee shops?

709
00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:07.980
Yeah, it was me and Michael's place.

710
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.220
We used to go there for breakfast
all the time.

711
00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.140
I mean, probably not as many times
as I think we did,

712
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.940
but enough.

713
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:25.380
We went there on the morning that...

714
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.460
It was the last place I saw him.

715
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:32.300
You go there to write to him?

716
00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.740
I just wanted to tell someone about you.

717
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:48.740
My mom was murdered 10 years ago.

718
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.100
You don't have to say anything.
You're sorry. I know.

719
00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.180
And my dad...

720
00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.340
My dad's the kind of guy
who needs to take care of people.

721
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:05.060
I know that sounds kind of weird right now,

722
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.460
but he's not that guy.

723
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.620
You know, I trust him. I really do.

724
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.900
And I just don't want you to think
that I'm here

725
00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.820
'cause he's some crazy, belligerent person.

726
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:25.100
He just doesn't understand, or...

727
00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:31.460
I don't know, just doesn't know
what's going on right now.

728
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.780
What's going on right now?

729
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:46.300
I don't know.

730
00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:59.220
- Did you call dispatch to check?
- I...

731
00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:01.340
You're gonna have to testify to this!

732
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.100
And they're gonna ask you,
"Are you sure of the time?"

733
00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.860
And you're gonna say what?

734
00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:07.180
- 8:15?
- Come on, you...

735
00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.380
- Neil.
- What?

736
00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.540
Hey,

737
00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.460
- Ally called Sharon.
- What?

738
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.620
She said to tell you that she's with friends
and she's doing fine.

739
00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:24.460
- Which friends?
- She didn't say.

740
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.980
That's all?

741
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:31.820
Yeah. I'm sorry, buddy.

742
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.940
Look, why don't you come out
for the weekend?

743
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.860
We'll get the grill going.
Sharon wants to see you,

744
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.580
- and we'll call some nice people up...
- No.

745
00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.180
- Come out to Patchogue, Neil...
- No, Leo. Stop!

746
00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:53.460
Make a wish!

747
00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:04.020
Come on...
All right!

748
00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.820
- Yeah!
- Big two-two!

749
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.100
Big 22!
Yeah!

750
00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:13.420
- Wait... Right, two, three...
- Think one, two, three...

751
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:14.900
Look at her.

752
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.500
- One, two, three...
- Tyler? I'm worried.

753
00:58:22.060 --> 00:58:25.300
I'm concerned her father
isn't gonna come to her show.

754
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.660
Well, yeah. I'd be worried, too.

755
00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.420
I was hoping for some reassurance.

756
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.300
- One, two, three...
- Spin. Got that.

757
00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:37.460
She's gonna be heartbroken.
Listen...

758
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.340
I'll get him there.

759
00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:49.540
- You will? Really?
- Yeah, Mom. I'll get him there.

760
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.500
- Thanks.
- Aidan. Aidan, get your...

761
00:58:56.060 --> 00:58:58.140
- One, two, three. One...
- Two, three...

762
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.540
Get your filthy hands off my sister.

763
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.900
Thank God.

764
00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:04.140
<i>- Madame.</i>
- Tyler.

765
00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:09.100
So, you're actually the second member
of the family that I've washed dishes with.

766
00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.140
Tyler?

767
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:17.020
He's never washed a dish in his life.
He must have tried to impress you.

768
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.060
Ah...

769
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:23.100
- He says you're in social work.
- Mmm-hmm.

770
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:24.300
Did you go to school for that?

771
00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.580
They're afraid to move at all.
They're certainly not gonna come down.

772
00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.100
That's why
they're gonna come down.

773
00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.300
Charles, it's your son.

774
00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.620
- What?
- He's on the phone.

775
00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.500
Tyler, you're on speakerphone.

776
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.060
- Yeah, I'm calling about Caroline's art show.
<i>- What about it?</i>

777
00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:56.980
Hold on.

778
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.700
No.

779
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.900
<i>Yes. Tyler?</i>

780
01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:09.300
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wanted to have dinner beforehand.

781
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.420
What?

782
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.140
Do you want to have dinner before?

783
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.500
Yeah. Yeah, that would be fine.

784
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.580
I'll have Janine make a reservation
somewhere nice, like the...

785
01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.620
I don't know, the Oak Room.

786
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:23.340
No, that's not what I mean.

787
01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.620
<i>How many?</i>

788
01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:28.820
<i>Tyler, how many?</i>

789
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.940
Three.

790
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.620
<i>All right. Three it is.</i>

791
01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.420
It's 22 today, isn't it?

792
01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.940
Yeah.

793
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.340
Happy birthday.

794
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.980
<i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

795
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.500
Enter.

796
01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.780
We're gonna go.

797
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.220
Thanks for the party, Maestro.

798
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.340
Did it suck?

799
01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:11.300
Ha, ha!

800
01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

801
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.660
- I'll go and get us a cab.
- Okay.

802
01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.220
Wow!

803
01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.420
Can I see?

804
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.060
That's exactly him.

805
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.620
It's like the cigarette's the last Coke
in the desert.

806
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.340
- I can't believe he smokes in front of you.
- Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable.

807
01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:06.460
You know, when I was younger, we didn't
have air conditioning in the house,

808
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.020
so during the summer, my mom and I
would go to museums to cool off.

809
01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:14.220
She loved them all,
but the Met was her favorite.

810
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.020
Yeah. The Met's one of my favorite places

811
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:19.580
- in the world.
- Yeah?

812
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.380
So, you've got an art exhibit coming up?

813
01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.260
Yeah.

814
01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.300
You mind if I come?

815
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.940
I mean, I understand
if you don't want some random girl there.

816
01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.460
You're not random.
You're Tyler's girlfriend.

817
01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.180
<i>And while we must devote</i>

818
01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.700
<i>enormous energy to conquering disease,</i>

819
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.020
<i>it is equally important</i>
<i>that we pay attention to the moral concerns</i>

820
01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:56.220
<i>raised by the new frontier</i>
<i>of human embryo stem cell research.</i>

821
01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.620
<i>Even the most noble ends</i>
<i>do not justify any means.</i>

822
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.180
<i>Embryonic stem cell research offers both</i>
<i>great promise and great peril...</i>

823
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.780
Have you ever been
to the Oak Room before?

824
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.860
Oh, yeah. I come here all the time
with my dad and his bowling buddies.

825
01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.460
He can stand me up,
but he can't stand you up.

826
01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.660
And he can't stand my sister up.

827
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.940
- Can I get another whiskey, please?
- Give me the same, Sean.

828
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:33.060
- Laphroaig. Neat.
- Yes.

829
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.380
- And for the lady?
- I'm still good. Thanks.

830
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:53.220
Alyssa Craig, this is my father,
Charles Hawkins. Ally.

831
01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.140
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure.

832
01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.580
So, you're going to be a social worker?

833
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.780
Yeah. But with a focused area
of responsibility.

834
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:13.980
- Makes it easier to get a job.
- I see. What area is that going to be?

835
01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:17.180
- Criminal justice.
- That's a...

836
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.980
That's a tough area.

837
01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.460
When I was a kid,
I wanted to play shortstop for the Mets.

838
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:26.260
I don't think it's any harder than that.

839
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.540
The Mets!

840
01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.940
I'm from Queens.

841
01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.420
My father's a Yankees fan.
It has something to do with the payroll.

842
01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:38.660
It has something to do
with significant ball-playing.

843
01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.860
Right.

844
01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:42.780
You were a Yankees fan
when you were little.

845
01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.260
You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.

846
01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.060
Just blind familial allegiance.

847
01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:55.980
That's before I knew what overpaid, overfed,
fat bastards they were.

848
01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.580
Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.

849
01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:04.460
It's a metaphor.

850
01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:10.500
Roger Clemens.

851
01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.940
Luis Sojo.

852
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.540
Shane Spencer.

853
01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.340
He's big-boned.

854
01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:40.980
Dessert now?

855
01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.820
- Does this still count as your entrée?
- People can change.

856
01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.180
So how long has your dad been a cop?

857
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.700
Twenty-two years.

858
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.860
Would you excuse me?

859
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.820
I'm so sorry.

860
01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.820
Hey. It's just a phone call.
At least he waited till dessert.

861
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.740
You're killing me.
Look, you're killing me right now. Okay?

862
01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:17.500
- I'm so sorry. And your mother?
- She passed away when I was 11.

863
01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.900
She was murdered, and I was there.

864
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:30.260
I never mentioned that part.

865
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.020
Why are you saying this now?

866
01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.820
I don't know.

867
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:43.980
And here you are.

868
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:47.820
Here I am.

869
01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.180
He's not so bad.

870
01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.820
Oh, God.

871
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.780
No, don't say it.

872
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.420
I've got to go to the office.

873
01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.900
- Listen, the exhibit runs till 9:00.
- No, you have somewhere else to be.

874
01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:13.300
- You guys take my car, and I'll...
- I don't believe you!

875
01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:17.140
- That's all there is, Tyler.
- That's all there is?

876
01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.460
That's all there is?

877
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.980
Take the car. I'll get a cab,
and I'll meet you there.

878
01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.580
It's not enough.

879
01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.380
It's not enough.

880
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.860
Do I actually look like that?

881
01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:34.300
Oh, no.
It was probably just the lighting.

882
01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.060
I brought you every single flavor.

883
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.220
I'm ready to go home now.

884
01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:46.740
Ally.

885
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:57.100
God, Tyler? Can we at least talk about this?

886
01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:00.100
Where are you going to go right now?
And what are you gonna do

887
01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.340
that's actually gonna help anything?
Do you really think...

888
01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.420
You better look after yourself for an hour.

889
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.380
Are you capable of doing that?

890
01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.100
Are you guys telling me you get the call
at 6:00, and I don't get it till 8:00 tonight?

891
01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.900
Now, I don't know what's going on,
but someone's dropped the ball here...

892
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:36.020
- Tyler!
- Mr. Hawkins!

893
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.860
It's fine, Janine. It's fine.

894
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.100
She drew you a picture. She drew you
a picture, and you didn't come.

895
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.660
Put it on the table.

896
01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:52.180
You have a daughter who sincerely believes
that you don't like her.

897
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:57.100
I mean, she's trying to communicate.
She's speaking.

898
01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.940
But why aren't you listening?
I mean, why aren't you

899
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.460
riveted?

900
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:09.300
Why is this not the most important thing,
just for one night?

901
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:11.180
Tyler.

902
01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:14.660
- We can come back.
- No, it's fine. Sit down. Sit down. It's okay.

903
01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.780
Who's this display for?

904
01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.020
It's for you.

905
01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:29.180
She knows I'll take care of her.

906
01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.300
And?

907
01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.820
- We really can come back another...
- Sit the fuck down! Now!

908
01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.500
And that I love her. I love her.

909
01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:46.780
Good God, you toss that word around,
but you have no idea what it means!

910
01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.300
Maybe I don't.

911
01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.940
- And maybe Caroline doesn't, either.
- I have provided her world, and yours.

912
01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.260
That doesn't mean you can just shatter it
whenever you feel,

913
01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.300
Whenever there's something better to do!

914
01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.740
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

915
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.020
You pedaled down here on your bike,
for Christ's sake!

916
01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.660
You gotta take care of nothing!
You're responsible for no one! You're a kid!

917
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.580
You think you're the first one
to lose anything?

918
01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:14.620
You think that whatever you feel
in your heart, I don't also feel it in mine?

919
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.980
You didn't find him.

920
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.980
See, I found him.

921
01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:27.860
And you're so just tragically blind

922
01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:33.100
that the rest of your children
are gonna hang themselves on your watch.

923
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.620
You little piece of... Come over here,
I'm gonna smack you.

924
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.380
- What? What?
- No. No!

925
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.140
Tyler! Get out of here! Get out of here!

926
01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.300
God, there's no frigging air in here!

927
01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.220
Hey!

928
01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:00.700
Hey.

929
01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.460
Hey.

930
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.940
Hey. Hey.

931
01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.700
Come here. It's okay.
It's okay, baby. Come here.

932
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:13.700
It's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

933
01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.780
It's okay. Okay?

934
01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.500
It's okay.

935
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.820
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

936
01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.580
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>
<i>I'm okay, and...</i>

937
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.660
<i>I'm going away for Labor Day.</i>

938
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.420
<i>Yeah, well, I hope you're good,</i>
<i>and I'll talk to you sometime.</i>

939
01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.300
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

940
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.620
<i>Dad, it's me.</i>

941
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:31.660
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>
<i>I'm okay, and...</i>

942
01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.180
<i>I'm going away for Labor Day.</i>

943
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.380
Second word.

944
01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:57.020
Long-armed?
Trunk?

945
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.380
Breathing?

946
01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.140
- Referee?
- Direction?

947
01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.380
The wall... The wall.
High?

948
01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.180
You're climbing over the wall.
Over the hill...

949
01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:24.140
I want a girlfriend.

950
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.900
- What?
- Dinners out. Movies.

951
01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.140
Regular sex.

952
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:35.980
I could handle that for, like, a summer.

953
01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.420
- You're such a romantic.
- Yeah, damn right.

954
01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.420
I've been romantic with all the races.

955
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.900
- Excuse me?
- I have planted my flag in every continent.

956
01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.780
- So, white girl.
- Please. It's like falling off a log.

957
01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:55.260
Asian.

958
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:58.860
Um...

959
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.820
- Eskimo.
- Next stop, Patchogue.

960
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.460
- No!
- Monica Impellie.

961
01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.540
She works at the public library
on 96th Street.

962
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:10.620
- You slept with an Eskimo?
- You went to the library?

963
01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:14.180
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.

964
01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:16.380
- She's a nice girl.
- Prove it. 10 bucks.

965
01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.580
You wanna go to the library?
The second we get off this train.

966
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.300
- Fine.
- Are you coming?

967
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.180
No, I'm gonna skip
this particular bloodbath, thank you.

968
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.860
Leo. You're off duty.

969
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.660
Station stop is Patchogue.

970
01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.100
Where is she?

971
01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:45.820
- What are you doing in my house?
- Where is my daughter?

972
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.060
She's at the library.

973
01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.220
Does she know?

974
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.620
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

975
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.180
I figured you'd probably leave it up to me

976
01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.180
when you're done with her.

977
01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.540
I'm not going anywhere.

978
01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.900
Boy, that's true. Tyler Hawkins.

979
01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.820
Son of Charles and Diane.

980
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:25.860
Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased.

981
01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.460
Suicide by hanging.

982
01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.380
You're kind of lost, aren't you?

983
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:40.860
Take a little vacation in coach
before finding your way back to first class?

984
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:45.860
You think you know me,

985
01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.060
but you don't.

986
01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.660
But I do know you.

987
01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.100
I know you got nothing.

988
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:00.740
I know you threw away the one person
that gave a shit.

989
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:04.500
Now you wanna blame me. That's all right.

990
01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.660
But you know what?

991
01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.100
I did the whole thing for a bet anyway.

992
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:00.180
Get a fucking deadbolt!

993
01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.260
Tyler Keats Hawkins!
You are never gonna believe this!

994
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:38.300
He banged an Inuit!

995
01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:42.940
And she's really nice and really smart,
and I really don't get it.

996
01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.020
What's wrong?

997
01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:54.540
Your dad was here.

998
01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:56.780
Wait... What?

999
01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:01.140
- Your dad was here when I got home.
- Shit.

1000
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.900
Shit! Okay, what did he say?

1001
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.980
I know him.

1002
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.340
He arrested me and Aidan before I met you.

1003
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.380
The gash on my eye?
That was him.

1004
01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.660
I don't really understand.

1005
01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.500
I mouthed off to him and he responded.

1006
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.780
And then Aidan saw you guys at school,

1007
01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:36.540
so he suggested that

1008
01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.500
I introduce myself to you.

1009
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.500
I feel sick.

1010
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:56.780
Ally.

1011
01:19:59.100 --> 01:20:00.260
Ally.

1012
01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.660
Ally.

1013
01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:12.260
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

1014
01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.820
But you don't need to do that.

1015
01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:20.460
Do you even realize what you've done?

1016
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.620
Ally.

1017
01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:31.380
I mean, did you really think
I would never find out?

1018
01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:35.300
I had to find out eventually.
You set it up that way.

1019
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.300
Ally, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not a big deal.

1020
01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:44.900
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- That's exactly what you meant to do.

1021
01:20:57.140 --> 01:20:59.980
You had to tell her eventually, man.

1022
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:06.220
She'll be back.

1023
01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:53.340
You're not supposed to use that
on nonstick pans.

1024
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.980
It takes off the Teflon.

1025
01:21:58.660 --> 01:22:00.460
You gotta let it soak.

1026
01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.100
Okay.

1027
01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:06.140
I'm gonna...

1028
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:19.020
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, come on. It's supposed to be fun.

1029
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.500
You know, maybe if you tried
to meet people halfway, you know,

1030
01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.740
put a little bit of effort in?

1031
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.100
If you tried to grow up a little?

1032
01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:30.700
Maybe...

1033
01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.660
Caroline.

1034
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.220
Emily. Emily! Come on, the door.

1035
01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.540
- Happy birthday.
- Hi, sweetie.

1036
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.820
- Can you hold on a second? Yeah.
- Thank you.

1037
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.660
Thanks. Okay. Come on in, sweetie.
Come on in. The party's right in there.

1038
01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.860
Yeah. I know. I need ice. Ice. Yeah.
Napkins would be good.

1039
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.100
Oh, wait! Liz has gotta find her.

1040
01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.860
Yeah.

1041
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.180
<i>- I didn't do this for you.</i>
<i>- Thanks, dude.</i>

1042
01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:17.660
<i>- Where's my big guy?</i>
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>

1043
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:18.940
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1044
01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:26.100
<i>Jim! I got here a little early.</i>
<i>Get out!</i>

1045
01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.060
- I'll wait in the car.
- Go, Dad! Oh, my...

1046
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:32.620
Who is that? Is that your dad?
Yeah...

1047
01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.140
So, I'm just...
<i>I'm not embarrassed.</i>

1048
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.620
I am!

1049
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.340
Mom? I'm okay.

1050
01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.180
Don't panic. I'm gonna be fine.

1051
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.780
- I just need you to come get me right away.
- You've gotta get over here.

1052
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:51.900
Someone cut a chunk
out of this little girl's hair.

1053
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.060
Come quickly.

1054
01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.980
Hi. Is...

1055
01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:19.060
Alyssa Craig, does she live here?

1056
01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:21.900
Okay. Great. That's... I'm...

1057
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.700
You think I don't remember you?

1058
01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:28.140
- No, sir.
- Who is it?

1059
01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:34.620
It's okay.

1060
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.100
So, what do you want?

1061
01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.540
Look. I'm a prick. You know? And...

1062
01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.660
And?

1063
01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:51.820
Dad!

1064
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.340
Look, Tyler's not.

1065
01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.300
- Look, I...
- Would you just wait?

1066
01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.460
Shit! All right, I'm not...

1067
01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:01.300
I'm not any good at this. All right?
It's not my thing.

1068
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.780
He lied to me. Big time.

1069
01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.340
He's in love with you.

1070
01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.500
I have only seen him look at one other girl
the way he looks at you.

1071
01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.500
And she's a lot shorter and shares his DNA.

1072
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.700
You don't have to forgive him today.

1073
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.420
Just forgive him.

1074
01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:24.140
Yeah. She's pretty traumatized.

1075
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:26.660
- No! I'm trying.
- I wanted to pull some names together

1076
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.220
in case we all decided
she should talk to someone.

1077
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.900
I just talked to her. No.

1078
01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.580
Diane's pretty upset, too.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1079
01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.220
No, the girls are saying
Caroline did it to herself.

1080
01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.220
- But it's not true!
- Yeah.

1081
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.460
All of them.

1082
01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.580
"...he sang almost as beautifully."

1083
01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:44.540
It didn't happen
on school property, so...

1084
01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.140
"When he was grown, he left his mother..."

1085
01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.620
The school's not gonna do anything.

1086
01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:53.580
Yeah, they're probably
gonna get away with it.

1087
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:56.300
"...and his eight loving aunts,

1088
01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.740
"and he went to live
in his father's kingdom of Thrace

1089
01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:04.700
"to bring the joy of music to earth.
His voice rang so pure and true

1090
01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:07.980
"that the fiercest warriors
put down their swords

1091
01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:11.180
"and savage beasts
lay spellbound at his feet."

1092
01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:14.220
You give me the word
and I will steal their bikes.

1093
01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.900
Ally.

1094
01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:24.780
It's so sweet of you to come.

1095
01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.060
It's my last one ever. I swear.

1096
01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:57.220
Look, I...

1097
01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.140
I know you're not here for me.

1098
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:04.380
And I don't...

1099
01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.100
Just thank you for being here anyway.

1100
01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:23.580
And for what it's worth,
I think you're amazing.

1101
01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:33.860
How is she? Huh?

1102
01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.820
She's asleep.

1103
01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:10.260
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1104
01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.300
All right.

1105
01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.820
Did you do something different
with your hair? I love it.

1106
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.860
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1107
01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:19.740
Okay.
Okay, that's enough. Enough!

1108
01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:30.620
Excuse me! What are you doing? Stop!

1109
01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.460
Hawkins. You posted.

1110
01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.100
Destruction of private property.
Felony trespassing.

1111
01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.900
- I didn't call you.
- I know you didn't.

1112
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.860
I have unleashed a raging shit storm
of epic proportions

1113
01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.260
on the board of trustees
of that pissant school

1114
01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:28.220
that will not abate until those girls
seek enrollment elsewhere.

1115
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.940
I give them a week.

1116
01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.460
I know you think I'm a prick,
but I have my uses.

1117
01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.700
Can you come by the office
and talk to the lawyers?

1118
01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:47.940
Okay.

1119
01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.980
Try not to vandalize any more schools
in the meantime.

1120
01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.660
- Thanks for bailing me out.
- No problem!

1121
01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:16.860
- Hi.
- Hey.

1122
01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:23.660
Hey, using your little sister is dirty pool.

1123
01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:28.900
Is it working?

1124
01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.180
Maybe.

1125
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.740
Hey.

1126
01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.420
Hey.

1127
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.100
I gotta go to my dad's office.

1128
01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:25.460
Say hi to him for me.

1129
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:29.700
I love you.

1130
01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.140
Good.

1131
01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.180
I love you, too.

1132
01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.860
Hey, French toast or pancakes?

1133
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:47.020
- It doesn't matter.
- French toast.

1134
01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:00.940
- Hey. Good morning.
- What are you doing here?

1135
01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.580
Well, Tyler's coming by the office,

1136
01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:05.980
and I just thought
I'd ride to school with Caroline.

1137
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:09.260
- Is that okay?
- Okay. Sure.

1138
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.620
- Yeah. Great.
- Good. Good.

1139
01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:12.860
- All right...
- She's not ready, though.

1140
01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.580
- Don't worry about it. That's okay.
- She's gonna need at least 20 minutes.

1141
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:18.340
- I'll wait. I'm here, right downstairs.
- Okay.

1142
01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.500
Okay.

1143
01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.100
Are you running late,
or are you canceling altogether?

1144
01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.060
Are you already on your way?

1145
01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.700
I'm already here.

1146
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.340
<i>I'm taking Caroline to school.</i>

1147
01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.780
Okay.

1148
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.220
I'll wait in your office.

1149
01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:45.100
- It may be a while.
<i>- That's okay. That's fine.</i>

1150
01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:04.220
- Is Janine in?
- She went for coffee.

1151
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:05.980
She getting me any?

1152
01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:08.180
Just kidding.

1153
01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:55.980
You're bad. Dirty girl.

1154
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:59.540
What? Of course I was gonna call you!
You didn't think I forgot about you?

1155
01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.500
How could I forget you?

1156
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.580
Good morning, ladies.

1157
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.740
Good morning, Miss Giglio.

1158
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:11.180
Settle down.

1159
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.100
Good morning, Mr. Hawkins.

1160
01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:24.580
- Do you know about these?
- Who do you think scanned all the pictures?

1161
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:32.700
Look at you.

1162
01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.140
How old would he be?

1163
01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.660
He would've been 28 in May.

1164
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.140
It's really been that long?
I could've sworn...

1165
01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.900
It was May 20, 1995.

1166
01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:55.300
I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry.

1167
01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:02.860
It's all right.

1168
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.140
What a day.

1169
01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:34.220
Caroline? Hello?

1170
01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:57.540
<i>Whatever you do in life</i>
<i>will be insignificant,</i>

1171
01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:03.500
<i>but it's very important that you do it,</i>

1172
01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:08.740
<i>because nobody else will.</i>

1173
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.020
<i>Like when someone comes into your life,</i>

1174
01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.820
<i>and half of you says,</i>
<i>"You're nowhere near ready,"</i>

1175
01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:22.660
<i>but the other half says,</i>

1176
01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.740
<i>"Make her yours forever."</i>

1177
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.700
<i>Michael,</i>

1178
01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:42.060
<i>Caroline asked me what I would say</i>

1179
01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.380
<i>if I knew you could hear me.</i>

1180
01:38:48.060 --> 01:38:49.700
<i>I said I do know.</i>

1181
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:54.100
<i>"I love you.</i>

1182
01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.260
<i>"God, I miss you.</i>

1183
01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.700
<i>"And I forgive you."</i>
