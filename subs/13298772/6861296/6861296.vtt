00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.210
Charlie comes in hollering
about a small ugly man

2
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.480
hiding in the cars in the back tree line.

3
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.970
How ugly was he?

4
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.560
Did it smell a certain way?

5
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.010
Charlie said it was the
ugliest man he ever saw,

6
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.283
like fugly-ugly.

7
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.120
But did he smell something?

8
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.520
This is a scrap yard,
everything stinks around here.

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.220
Wait a minute, let me call him up.

10
00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:46.430
You have a theory?

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.490
Yep.

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.410
You?

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.070
- He's on his way.

14
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.960
- So what led you to get in touch

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.852
with the Cryptozoological
Investigative Department?

16
00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:55.685
- Huh?

17
00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:56.660
- Crypto Hunters.

18
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.830
- Oh, yeah, right.

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.160
We saw some weird stuff on the video feed,

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.090
tires flying trough the air,

21
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.693
cars moving with no equipment moving it.

22
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.620
Cops came 'round for like
five minutes then left.

23
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.693
The chicken shits.

24
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.980
It was my son Bobby who told me to call,

25
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.713
found your number from a website.

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.780
Charlie.

27
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.113
Tell these guys about that
fugly dude that you saw.

28
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.588
- I was pulling a radiator out a Dodge

29
00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:34.300
and I smelt this weird
burnt chocolate smell.

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.430
Then I started looking around the car.

31
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.490
Then all a sudden, I
see this little ugly guy

32
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.010
standing right there in the grass.

33
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.814
Scared the shit out of me.

34
00:01:42.814 --> 00:01:44.720
Then I threw my screw-diver at him

35
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.060
but he was gone real fast.

36
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.290
But I felt bad,

37
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.780
I thought it was some customer's
ugly kid or something.

38
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.680
- But it wasn't?

39
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.513
- No, I asked.

40
00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:53.850
Nobody has a kid out here.

41
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.600
- That's when we started
looking at the video tapes.

42
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.440
Usually we get homeless or thieves.

43
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.470
Dogs, you used to keep most of them away,

44
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.137
but they all disappeared
about six months ago.

45
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.100
- I think we need to
take a look at the Dodge.

46
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:28.813
I smell it.

47
00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.003
Woodwose, Satyr?

48
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.303
- Maybe, let's look for a burrow.

49
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.140
- You go left, I'll go right.

50
00:02:45.953 --> 00:02:46.786
Hobgoblin!

51
00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:03.498
Daddy said you're gonna be in a play.

52
00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:05.410
- Yes, I'm gonna be a sheep

53
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.890
and I mostly just stand around
saying

54
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.370
- Well, that sounds like fun.

55
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.000
Are you excited?

56
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.160
- I guess so.

57
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.870
Mommy, are you gonna be home tonight?

58
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.900
- No, sweetie, Sans and I
have to work this weekend.

59
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.370
But I'll be home Monday.

60
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.260
- Are you gonna shoot anything?

61
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.770
- We don't shoot anything.

62
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.823
We shoot monsters.

63
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.136
- Hi, Bug eyes!
- Hey, Snot face!

64
00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.848
- I'm gonna be a sheep!

65
00:04:31.848 --> 00:04:33.463
- I think they make a pill for that.

66
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.370
- Listen, sweetie, we
gotta get back to work.

67
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.318
So, tell daddy I love him
and lots of hugs and kisses.

68
00:04:41.318 --> 00:04:42.483
- Love you, mommy!

69
00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:43.536
Bye, Bug eyes!

70
00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:44.518
- Love you too!

71
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.980
- We heading to the farm now?

72
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.870
- Yeah, I was just
watching this kid's videos.

73
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.690
He's been posting once or twice a week,

74
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.170
mainly about this creepy barn

75
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.970
and what he thinks is lurking there.

76
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.463
He seems really terrified of the place.

77
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.033
But this is the one that
has people all spun-up.

78
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.720
- Last night, we saw these weird orbs

79
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.870
floating near the barn.

80
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.143
- I saw them first.

81
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.160
I was looking out the window

82
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.080
'cause I didn't wanna go to sleep

83
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.040
and I saw a weird light
by the tree by the barn.

84
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.010
- Carrie came and got me
and watched for 10 minutes

85
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.180
as this weird orb moved around the barn.

86
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.369
It was kind of a purple or pink color.

87
00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:32.460
- Definitely purple.

88
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.980
- At first, I thought
it was a lightning bug,

89
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.360
but then I thought that lightning bugs

90
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.060
couldn't get that big, so...

91
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.950
- It was an E.T.

92
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.783
- Maybe.

93
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.320
So, anyway, I thought
that we'd come out here

94
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.980
and check something out and maybe find out

95
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.030
where it came from.

96
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.200
- Did you tell mom?

97
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200
- No, I didn't tell mom,

98
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.910
you know how she gets when
she's planning an event.

99
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.230
But I got my BB gun just in
case anything pops out on us.

100
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.501
- Okay, just don't shoot the cat, again.

101
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:58.501
- All right.

102
00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.550
- Are we going inside?

103
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.843
- Let's go take a
look at the woods first.

104
00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:15.723
What is that?

105
00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:16.820
- What?

106
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.370
- Look, there's something in there.

107
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.810
- I see some kind of shadow.

108
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.000
Are you taking a video?

109
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.118
- Yes, I'm recording.

110
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.730
- Werewolf?
- Possibly.

111
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.830
But this far east, I don't know.

112
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.420
- Wendigo?

113
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.170
- The kids would be dead if it was.

114
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.880
- Did they hear a sound?

115
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.183
- Listen, you know it wasn't an A.T.R.

116
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.570
- Close to trees.

117
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.823
- It's a long drive, we need
to hurry up and just get going.

118
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.780
- Hello, you guys must be my weekenders.

119
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.303
- Yes, ma'am, I'm Diego, this is Sans.

120
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.740
Lovely place you have here.

121
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.410
- Thank you, it's a work in progress.

122
00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.960
Did you guys find the place okay?

123
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.370
- It's kind of out here in the country,

124
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.920
but you know, our GPS got us here okay.

125
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.407
- GPS is just so the
government can track you.

126
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.023
- Okay.

127
00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.770
Well, let me to show to your rooms.

128
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:29.110
- This place is kinda
creepy and strange, huh?

129
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.290
- Yeah.

130
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.383
Seeing a monster will make you think that.

131
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.993
I gotta piss.

132
00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:51.010
- Welcome, guys.

133
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.990
Just wanna let you guys know

134
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.140
that over there is our dining room

135
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.080
and over here is the lounge area

136
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.600
and I can take you guys
upstairs to show you your rooms.

137
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.050
- Great.
- Follow me.

138
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.883
- Great.

139
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.274
That's awesome.

140
00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:04.300
- You guys enjoying the weather?

141
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.631
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- Awesome.

142
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:07.840
Well, I just wanna let you guys know

143
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.150
that we have a room down here,
we also have a room in here.

144
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.840
There are sheets, blankets and
towels in that whole closet,

145
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.830
water and snacks are in both rooms.

146
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.990
The wifi password is on the
desk if you guys need it.

147
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.000
We're having dinner tonight at six,

148
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.800
my husband is making salad,
meatloaf and rhubarb pie,

149
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.288
he's the one who cooks.

150
00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:29.786
- When can we look at the barn?

151
00:09:29.786 --> 00:09:32.100
- Oh, what my friend is trying to say is,

152
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.410
will you be able to give us a tour

153
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.570
of the rest of the property?

154
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:35.670
- And the barn?

155
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.440
Yeah, I can have my husband
or maybe my son Troy

156
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.010
show you guys the carriage
rooms and the stalls.

157
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.910
I just wanna let you guys
know that not all the rooms

158
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.410
are open to the public.

159
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.610
We're still working some things out.

160
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.110
- Well, that'd be great, thanks.

161
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.550
- Awesome, let me show
you one of the rooms.

162
00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:00.920
- You guys are
crypto hunters, right?

163
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.145
- Cryptozoological investigators.

164
00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:04.591
- Cryptozoological-

165
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:05.820
- We're crypto hunters.

166
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.060
- We investigate.

167
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.460
And if on a rare occasion,

168
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:11.950
we come across something of the
crypto type, we take action.

169
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.923
You sent us a message
and we saw the video,

170
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.510
so we thought we'd come check it out.

171
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.400
- Look, my parents aren't
happy we posted that video.

172
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.630
Some weirdos, some of
them would just show up

173
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.960
and some would call ahead to see

174
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.480
if they could go ghost hunting.

175
00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.360
Some dude even showed
up with a Geiger counter

176
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.330
and a respirator.

177
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.190
Dad called the cops on that guy.

178
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.390
- Reverend Ben?

179
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.223
- Probably.

180
00:10:32.223 --> 00:10:34.280
- I'm sorry, Reverend who?

181
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.490
- He's a different type of investigator.

182
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.053
He thinks all cryptos come from Chernobyl.

183
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.530
- So where did you see it?

184
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.460
- Around the back part of the building.

185
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.380
- Let's go take a look.

186
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.720
- I wouldn't, there's
renovation and you know,

187
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.580
it's very raggedy-
- It's all right, kid.

188
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.390
Look, we're just gonna
go look around outside.

189
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.190
Your mom told us about all the work.

190
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.620
I'm curious to see the layout.

191
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.033
- Curiosity skinned the cat.

192
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.070
- I don't think that's
how the saying goes.

193
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:14.603
- Well, then how'd the cat die?

194
00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:24.000
- Hey, what's going on?

195
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.057
- They went behind the
barn to go check it out.

196
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.190
- Hi, I'm Linda.

197
00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.630
Are you guys looking to
host an event or a wedding?

198
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.960
- Hi, I'm Jannet, and this is Gord.

199
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.470
He's performing this weekend in town

200
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.620
and thought we would check this place out.

201
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.220
- Hello.

202
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.720
- This is my husband, Greg,

203
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.360
and those are kids, Troy and Carrie.

204
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.060
- It's even better than the video.

205
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.830
- The video my son posted?

206
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:23.640
- Yeah, my drummer Brian
mentioned this place was nearby.

207
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.313
We'd seen the video a bunch of times, man.

208
00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:26.883
I had to see where it happened.

209
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.037
- Troy, you got another fan of your video.

210
00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:35.120
- TroJam, awesome video, dude!

211
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.630
- Oh my God, GBM.

212
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.360
Gord from GBM.

213
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.400
- You know my music?

214
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.910
- Yeah.
- Cool.

215
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.360
- You took me to the
concert last year, remember?

216
00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:46.403
- I think so.

217
00:12:46.403 --> 00:12:49.100
- You, I love that scream.

218
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.190
Loud enough to wake demons.

219
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.360
Should be in movies or
heavy metal music, huh?

220
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.730
I'd like to bring some folks out here

221
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.360
and do a little jam session.

222
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.850
Nothing big, maybe six or seven people.

223
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.130
- Sure, what dates were you looking at?

224
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.769
- Monday till maybe Thursday.

225
00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:05.602
- Oh.

226
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.200
- Yeah, why not?

227
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.580
We got people checking out Sunday,

228
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.210
so we should be able to
get the place cleaned up

229
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.140
and have it ready for
you guys come Monday.

230
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.790
- This place will work just fine.

231
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.420
- Okay, I'll start getting
everything in place.

232
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.270
- Cool, cool.

233
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.000
Jannet will get my manager to contact you.

234
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.900
- Okay, have your manager call or email me

235
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.880
and we'll work out all the details.

236
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:28.713
- Definitely.

237
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.980
- That was interesting.

238
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.853
- Is this gonna be the new normal for us?

239
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.773
- I think that's
the door from the video.

240
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.040
- Wood's pretty close.

241
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.143
- Not far at all.

242
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.980
- Be real easy for
something to get in there.

243
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.433
- Barely an inconvenience.

244
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.820
But I don't wanna get into
anything too heavy yet.

245
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.720
Let's go make friendly with the hosts.

246
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.293
Hi, there.

247
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:22.403
You must be Carrie?

248
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.317
- That's my name.

249
00:14:24.317 --> 00:14:25.250
Who are you?

250
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.706
- These are the crypto
hunters I told you about.

251
00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:30.020
Did you guys find anything?

252
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.010
- No, but we'll look again later.

253
00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:34.740
It's dinner time and we
should get settled in.

254
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.980
Don't worry, kid.

255
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.520
We'll figure it out.

256
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.930
So your dad cooks, huh?

257
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.890
Is he any good?

258
00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.860
- Yeah, he was a cook on a submarine.

259
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.840
- Woo, hot damn!

260
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.540
Those are the best cooks out there.

261
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.790
- Yeah, he's pretty good.

262
00:14:55.785 --> 00:14:57.327
- Are you too married?

263
00:14:57.327 --> 00:14:59.327
- No, are you proposing?

264
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.338
Got you, kid.

265
00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:04.540
- What'd I miss?

266
00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.073
- Your daughter just got burned. Oh no.

267
00:15:07.073 --> 00:15:08.330
- Oh, no, are you serious?

268
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.630
- So I missed it.

269
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.570
Well, at least I got some pie

270
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.370
in case anybody still got some room.

271
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.332
So what do you guys do?

272
00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:16.165
- Monster hunting-

273
00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.114
- We're cryptozoological investigators.

274
00:15:19.114 --> 00:15:20.830
- You hear about Troy's video?

275
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.350
- That's correct.

276
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.130
We're here to investigate the sightings.

277
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.053
- Investigate?

278
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.710
Just who are you people?

279
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.220
- Cryptozoological specialists.

280
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.630
Sometimes we're sent in to
work with law enforcement,

281
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.710
the military, search and
rescue and others, you know,

282
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.993
to investigate when
something weird pops up.

283
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.413
- So you're like police?

284
00:15:44.413 --> 00:15:47.200
- We have monsters, not criminals.

285
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.610
- We have some authority,

286
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:53.610
but we're more like a contractor
or private investigator.

287
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.380
- So you said you were usually sent in

288
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.453
by the military and police.

289
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.900
Why are you here?

290
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.090
Did the sheriff or local
police contact you?

291
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.323
- I contacted them.

292
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.370
I wanted them to look
at the shadow figure.

293
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.960
- Okay, look, I have been
all over the property

294
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.580
and I have not found anything
that looks like the thing

295
00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.600
that was in the video.

296
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.763
I'm not certain what you can do to help.

297
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:27.240
- Look, I get it.

298
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.110
We show up telling you
we wanna find a creature

299
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.460
that was seen in the video,

300
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.140
but this video sort of went viral

301
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.780
and suddenly you've
got weirdos showing up.

302
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.773
- Like Gord?

303
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.870
- Gord?

304
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.970
- Yeah, Gord from GBM.

305
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.330
He dropped by when you guys
were looking at the barn.

306
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.903
- Wait, you two know him?

307
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.080
- We've looked into him in the past.

308
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.330
He's presented with some signs
that put him on our radar.

309
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:57.690
- How so?

310
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.930
- He's a druid.

311
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:02.120
- He's from central Europe
where some old religions

312
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.310
are still practiced.

313
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.620
He rented the barn for a few days.

314
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.863
Should I cancel?

315
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.190
- You do what's right for your business,

316
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:11.713
but I'd be cautious.

317
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.393
- Troy.

318
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:25.840
Why did you call these guys?

319
00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.173
- I messed everything up.

320
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.544
- What do you mean?

321
00:17:33.544 --> 00:17:35.010
- I mean, I was just trying to show

322
00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:38.210
what was going on at the
barn< nobody believed me.

323
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.320
And then people started
to bother you and mom

324
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.130
and I just wanted to fix it.

325
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.785
- It's not that we don't believe you.

326
00:17:44.785 --> 00:17:46.685
We're just not seeing the same things.

327
00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.160
- All right, what do we
know about these guys?

328
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.210
Where'd you find them?

329
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.143
- The Crypto Hunters are
legends on SpookTube.

330
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.650
They're like the Men in
Black, but with monsters.

331
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.503
- Okay, well, at least they were invited.

332
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.300
And they seem more normal than
some of the others lately.

333
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:26.110
Maybe they can convince
you there's no monsters

334
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:27.360
creeping around the barn.

335
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.203
Okay, so what do you need from us?

336
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.773
- We'd like to look at the
barn, check out the woods.

337
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.024
- Probably a wendigo.

338
00:18:47.857 --> 00:18:51.143
- Sans, don't jump to conclusions.

339
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.370
We'd just like to check it out
and see if there is anything.

340
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.730
If there's not, you know,

341
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.630
we'll send it out to the Crypto Community

342
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.040
and people probably just stop bugging you.

343
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.890
- And what if it's real?

344
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:05.933
- Then it gets real.

345
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.720
- Sans.

346
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.160
What Sans is not saying very well...

347
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.290
We'll talk later, Sans.

348
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.150
Is that we have various
methods of dealing with things.

349
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:21.893
Whether it's natural or crypto.

350
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.673
- Apple.

351
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:30.910
- I meant to ask, is it okay
if we invite another expert?

352
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.410
- What kind of expert?

353
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.943
- Well, she specializes
in paranormal things.

354
00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:41.870
- She sees ghosts.

355
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.430
- Mrs. Apple is a spiritual counselor.

356
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.120
She can tell us if there's
something paranormal

357
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.433
that we need to look into.

358
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.403
- Okay.

359
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.220
You can bring Mrs. Apple by.

360
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.460
I'll show you guys around tomorrow,

361
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.670
but I'm not sure you're
gonna find your Winabago

362
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.824
or Winaprego, whatever it was you said.

363
00:20:06.824 --> 00:20:08.112
- Wendigo.

364
00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:10.124
- What's a wendigo?

365
00:20:10.124 --> 00:20:12.270
- They're kind of like
golems but with antlers.

366
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.010
- You mean like that little gray guy

367
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.130
that stole the ring from Bilbo?

368
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.520
- No, Bilbo stole the ring from Gollum,

369
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.000
so then Gollum stole it back from Frodo.

370
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.960
But I don't think that's the same thing,

371
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.754
I think he was a deformed
hobbit or something.

372
00:20:27.754 --> 00:20:29.620
- Golems are made out of clay.

373
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.210
- Created by the Jews.

374
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.050
- How do you know if it's Jewish?

375
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.230
- Well, you have to look and see if it's -

376
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.230
- Sans!

377
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.230
Don't say it.

378
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.223
- Circumcised?

379
00:20:39.128 --> 00:20:39.961
- Sans.

380
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:42.597
- Are you sure you two aren't married?

381
00:20:57.645 --> 00:21:00.145
- Do you think it's out there?

382
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.520
Look, maybe once this is over,
we can take a few weeks off.

383
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.963
I can spend time with the
family and you can go searching.

384
00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:20.040
But let's figure out what's going on.

385
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.590
This family might be in danger.

386
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.530
- I'll set up some trail
cameras, hunker down.

387
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:37.423
No shooting tonight, I promise.

388
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.850
- The previous owners moved to Florida,

389
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.440
the place sat abandoned
for about 50 years.

390
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.490
Linda's dad bought it
when she was about 10

391
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.190
and then we had the bright idea

392
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.930
to turn it into a luxury
B&B and event venue.

393
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:57.780
- Hmm, interesting.

394
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.010
So how long before you hold events?

395
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.210
- Oh, we already do.

396
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:03.130
We got a couple of rooms
for the bridal party

397
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:03.963
and then above the barn,

398
00:22:03.963 --> 00:22:05.050
we got the carriage room cleaned up,

399
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.740
set up a couple of bathrooms,

400
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.450
although we'll still bring
in portable bathrooms

401
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.640
when we have a lot of guests.

402
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.000
- Portable bathrooms?

403
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.310
- Yeah, it's basically a fancy trailer.

404
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:16.180
They got a couple changing
rooms, two full sized bathrooms.

405
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.440
They come in, guests do their
business, it drives away.

406
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.932
- Less clean up for you.

407
00:22:21.765 --> 00:22:23.408
- Yeah, no, they literally
drive the shit away.

408
00:22:24.241 --> 00:22:25.820
- Drive this shit away.

409
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.320
That ought to be their slogan.

410
00:22:28.927 --> 00:22:29.760
Car door closes

411
00:22:30.893 --> 00:22:31.726
- I think that's Mrs.
- Apple.

412
00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.330
- What are you doing?

413
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.850
- Looking at her eyes.

414
00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.080
- Well, I can see that, but why?

415
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.890
- Mr. Sans says she can see ghosts,

416
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.733
so I figured that'd be
something weird with her eyes.

417
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.290
- And do you see anything weird?

418
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.173
- Not really.

419
00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.880
- You're an interesting little girl.

420
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.240
How old are you?

421
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.210
- 10, how old are you?

422
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.455
- Carrie!

423
00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:03.823
- Ha, you blinked!

424
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.800
Diego tells me you have
a very interesting barn.

425
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.400
I understand some of it's
typically off limits,

426
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.020
but could I take a look?

427
00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.040
- Well, the second floor
is still being renovated

428
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.140
and really hasn't been organized,

429
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.820
but I guess as long as we're careful,

430
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.750
I could walk you around.

431
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.640
- Can I come too?

432
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.410
I like to see all the ghosts.

433
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.930
- I doubt you're gonna
see any ghost, but okay.

434
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.000
- Fantastic.

435
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.133
I'll grab my crystals.

436
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.650
- All right, I guess I'll
take Mr. Sans and Ms. Diego

437
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.316
and show 'em around some of
the back rooms and the stalls.

438
00:23:40.316 --> 00:23:43.084
- I'd like to go with you, dad.

439
00:23:43.084 --> 00:23:43.917
- You sure?

440
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:45.634
Okay.

441
00:23:51.922 --> 00:23:53.458
- This way.

442
00:24:36.696 --> 00:24:39.230
- So just about everything you
see is original to the lodge.

443
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.990
The holding pens,

444
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.797
these milk stalls haven't
been used since the 1920s.

445
00:24:47.187 --> 00:24:50.473
- Looks like a good place
for a Nosferatu or a Dracula.

446
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.900
- They're called vampires.

447
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.540
- Well, I don't speak Romanian, so...

448
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.410
- Where do you think the
word Nosferatu comes from?

449
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:00.243
- Books.

450
00:25:04.115 --> 00:25:04.948
Cobra pig!

451
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:09.141
- Did someone just scream
something about a pig?

452
00:25:11.245 --> 00:25:12.078
- Hunters.

453
00:25:12.917 --> 00:25:14.580
- You guys have guns?

454
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.280
- Of course, you don't?

455
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.410
- It's okay, false alarm.

456
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.010
- You said it was cobra something.

457
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:22.170
What was it?

458
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:23.003
- A cat.

459
00:25:23.003 --> 00:25:24.910
- You were gonna shoot Carrie's cat?

460
00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:27.010
- We don't shoot cats, we're not monsters.

461
00:25:36.596 --> 00:25:40.032
- So, is that normal
to just pull your guns

462
00:25:40.032 --> 00:25:41.427
on something like that?

463
00:25:41.427 --> 00:25:44.460
- I know it can seem sudden and extreme.

464
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.160
I know I was shocked the
first time my trainer did it

465
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.233
on my first mission.

466
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.820
But we're trained to be
in a process of offense,

467
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.083
so even as we identify, classify
and categorize the threat,

468
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.400
if it's harmless, we adjust.

469
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.433
If it's not, we also adjust.

470
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.443
- Aim, identify, shoot, or not.

471
00:26:08.688 --> 00:26:10.550
- Are there any accidents?

472
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.093
- We're here to help
monsters, not hurt people.

473
00:26:14.688 --> 00:26:15.521
Can we look now?

474
00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:24.879
- It would be a weird place
for something to hang out.

475
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.750
- Some creatures like
small places like this.

476
00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.253
- You guys really believe
in monsters and stuff?

477
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.820
- We're just here to figure out

478
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:39.720
if there's something dangerous around.

479
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.473
- We should go look in the woods.

480
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.370
- You two should hang back here.

481
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.293
- I wanna go.

482
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.506
- Okay.

483
00:27:00.506 --> 00:27:01.339
Are you sure?

484
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.380
All alright, let me just grab my rifle.

485
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.613
- Okay, we'll wait.

486
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.563
- Interesting.

487
00:27:27.893 --> 00:27:30.583
How do you feel about this place, Linda?

488
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.330
- I love it here.

489
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.463
It's peaceful and quiet.

490
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.673
I remember playing here as a kid.

491
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.983
Sometimes we would spend
the whole summer out here.

492
00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.573
It was creepy at first, but
nothing ever felt scary,

493
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.243
just old, forgotten.

494
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.810
My parents really wanted to do something

495
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:03.090
grand with this place, restore
it to its former glory,

496
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.023
make it into a museum, something.

497
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.710
Then when they retired,

498
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.353
I tried to think of
something to do with it.

499
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.363
It's kind of our family legacy.

500
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.880
Then Greg and I saw other places
like hunt clubs and farms,

501
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.400
and they were hosting weddings.

502
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.793
And I thought, why not our place?

503
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.510
Hopefully, Troy and Carrie

504
00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.460
can make this place bigger, grander.

505
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.350
- We can do a reality show.

506
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.673
I can be the star, Troy can help film it,

507
00:28:41.673 --> 00:28:44.063
and you and daddy can be in the show too.

508
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.350
- Thank you for letting me on
your show, you little diva.

509
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.550
Mrs. Apple, can I ask you a question?

510
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.470
Ms. Diego and Sans?

511
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.540
- Sure, sweetie.

512
00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.880
I know all the questions
and answers about those two.

513
00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.490
- Are they married?

514
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.843
- Well, yes and no.

515
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.400
But you were saying, Linda?

516
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.840
- Why monsters?

517
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.090
Why look for and hunt monsters?

518
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.830
- Well, we're all drawn
to a type of career,

519
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.670
just sometimes not the
one that you expected.

520
00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:22.770
Same with paranormal and cryptological.

521
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.050
Sometimes you don't know
what path you're gonna take

522
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.260
until you take it.

523
00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.810
- Are there really monsters?

524
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.220
- Yes, there really are.

525
00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.080
But most people never really meet any.

526
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.490
- I don't know, sounds like
a bunch of fairytales to me.

527
00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.450
- Why would anybody wanna see monsters?

528
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.450
- People want to see monsters,
ones with big teeth and horns

529
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:49.293
because you can easily
recognize them as monsters.

530
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:53.620
Meanwhile, most of the real
monsters that roam this earth

531
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.493
go around disguised as regular people.

532
00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.443
- You're weird, Mrs. Apple.

533
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.133
- Yeah, hello.

534
00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.260
I have a couple of guests
staying at my bed and breakfast,

535
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.950
say they're associated
with the police department.

536
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.363
I was wondering if you guys
could verify that for me?

537
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.574
Yeah, I'll hold.

538
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.290
- Detective
Corkland, what's your status?

539
00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:23.113
- 1064 at Gates Plaza.

540
00:30:24.302 --> 00:30:26.570
- I have a civilian
call routing to your phone.

541
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.403
- Roger that.

542
00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:34.030
Detective Corkland.

543
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.100
- Yeah, hello, sir, my
name is Greg Morgan.

544
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.060
I have a couple of guests
staying at my bed and breakfast,

545
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.000
woman named Diego, guy named Sans,

546
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.710
call themselves Crypto Hunters,

547
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:44.600
say they're associated with
your police department.

548
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.080
You know who I'm talking about?

549
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.640
- Crypto Hunters.

550
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.610
Yes, we know them.

551
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.170
Are they looking for something?

552
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.000
- Yeah, my son recorded a
video of a little while back

553
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.920
of a weird shadow, he thinks
it's a monster or something,

554
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.860
so I guess he gave these guys a call.

555
00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.723
Thing is, they have guns.

556
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.800
Are these guys okay?

557
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.810
- The Crypto Hunters has
helped us out a few times

558
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:06.810
in the past with some troublesome cases.

559
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.290
They're okay, but it's up to you

560
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.340
whether you wanna give them
access or let them look around.

561
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.173
- All right.

562
00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:15.830
Yeah, I just wanna make
sure they were legitimate.

563
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.200
- Where did you say you were?

564
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.649
- Harbor Cove out on Fairfield Lane.

565
00:31:20.897 --> 00:31:21.789
♪ It's Jaws ♪

566
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:22.810

- It's Jaws.

572
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:34.251
- It's Jaws?

573
00:31:36.365 --> 00:31:38.398

Have your gun ready.

577
00:32:34.675 --> 00:32:35.508
- Taurus!

578
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.403
- Greg, Troy, to your right!

579
00:32:47.009 --> 00:32:47.842
- I think it's a bear!

580
00:32:47.842 --> 00:32:49.610
- It had horns.

581
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.440
I saw horns.

582
00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.407
What was it?

583
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.080
- We think it was a Taurus,
sometimes called a Minotaur.

584
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.230
- Dad said it was a bear.

585
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.910
- People see what they expect to see,

586
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.970
until something convinces them otherwise.

587
00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.600
Your dad's a good guy.

588
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.920
He stood firm and took the shot.

589
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.620
- I was too scared to do anything.

590
00:33:22.046 --> 00:33:25.938
- It's okay to be scared,
but you didn't run.

591
00:33:25.938 --> 00:33:26.988
That means something.

592
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.146
- Were you shooting at something?

593
00:33:42.146 --> 00:33:43.646
- Minotaur.
- Bear.

594
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.470
- We were able to scare the creature away.

595
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:48.310
It seemed pretty frightened,

596
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.324
so I don't think it would be back soon.

597
00:33:50.324 --> 00:33:51.157
- I'll call the local warden

598
00:33:51.157 --> 00:33:52.166
and let him know to be on the look out.

599
00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:54.353
Hopefully it won't come so
close to the house again.

600
00:33:54.353 --> 00:33:56.953
- You think it was a bear
that Troy caught on video?

601
00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.760
Do you think it was a bear?

602
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.750
- Maybe.

603
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.600
You know, whatever it was, it's gone.

604
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.930
- Daddy, Mrs. Apple wants to have a seance

605
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:07.063
in the barn tonight.

606
00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.123
- Really?

607
00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.630
- I don't know about a seance,

608
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.930
she said something
about energies at night.

609
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:15.500
- Daddy, please?

610
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.733
It'll be so creepy.

611
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.790
- Okay.

612
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.290
- I guess I'll go make snacks.

613
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.823
- You up for it?

614
00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.410
- Yeah, I think I am.

615
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.650
- So, Greg borrows some friend's car

616
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.630
and drives 16 hours to Jacksonville.

617
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.603
Shows up tired, but he's in a crisp tux.

618
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:47.070
- Well, I mean, I did drive
the entire way in my underwear

619
00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.164
so it wouldn't get wrinkled.

620
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.010
One time, I even forgot and got
up and pumped gas like that.

621
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.540
- My dad was so impressed,

622
00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.500
he only lectured him for about 10 minutes

623
00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.350
before letting us leave for the prom.

624
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.660
- So where did Mr. Sans

625
00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.773
take you on your first date, Ms. Diego?

626
00:35:04.886 --> 00:35:07.370
- There's something you
should know about Sans;

627
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.118
he's too cheap to take me any place nice.

628
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.020
But I can tell you why we work together,

629
00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.313
why we do what we do.

630
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.740
Do you wanna hear that story?

631
00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.260
- Sure.

632
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.560
- It's kinda scary though.

633
00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.620
You know, sometimes this
world can be a bright,

634
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.183
happy, wonderful place,

635
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.423
but other times it could
be dark, frightening.

636
00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.630
There are creatures in this world

637
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.823
that are dark and frightening.

638
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.897
And I ran into one about 20 years ago.

639
00:35:45.902 --> 00:35:48.053
Guess what my job was then.

640
00:35:48.053 --> 00:35:49.685
- What?

641
00:35:49.685 --> 00:35:51.003
- I was a police officer.

642
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.103
I was so proud to be one too.

643
00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.860
I protected and helped people.

644
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.083
I was happy to do it.

645
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.453
One night, I was with my
partner and we got a call.

646
00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.610
We went to a house where a
man and a woman were fighting.

647
00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:10.910
You know, we were sent to make sure

648
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.933
that no one hurt each other.

649
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.590
When we arrived, we found the
man sitting in his living room

650
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.830
with blood on his face and clothes.

651
00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:25.623
It was just blood everywhere.

652
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.363
He sat in the corner, just
rocking back and forth.

653
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.520
He didn't say a word.

654
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:38.970
He actually didn't say a word
for a month after that night,

655
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.970
not even to tell us about the claw marks

656
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:43.223
on his face and arms.

657
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.493
The woman was gone.

658
00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.010
My partner and I noticed
that the back door

659
00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.903
was broken and open.

660
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.311
I told him to stay with the man

661
00:36:59.311 --> 00:37:01.011
and I was gonna go check out back.

662
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.050
The plan was to just go
check out the backyard

663
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:07.463
until more officers arrived.

664
00:37:10.712 --> 00:37:12.213
Out back, there were trees,

665
00:37:15.097 --> 00:37:20.097
and as I was looking around,
I heard a noise in the trees.

666
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.510
It was like nothing I
had ever heard before.

667
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.333
First, I thought it was an
animal, but it sounded different.

668
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:41.310
Then I thought maybe it was
the woman in pain nearby.

669
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.023
I was really, really scared.

670
00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.423
But I went into the woods
to see what was happening,

671
00:37:56.202 --> 00:37:59.923
it was very, very dark and
all I had was my flashlight.

672
00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:03.233
But I didn't wanna give up on the woman.

673
00:38:06.685 --> 00:38:08.338
And then...

674
00:38:08.338 --> 00:38:09.171
Bam!

675
00:38:09.171 --> 00:38:11.420
Some thing came out of
nowhere and it knocked me down

676
00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:14.923
and it was heavy and
furry and it was so fast.

677
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.160
When I looked around, it
was just all dark around me.

678
00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:22.641
So I got up and I just
stood there for a long time.

679
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.383
Then I thought I could
hear breathing behind me.

680
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.120
I turned around as fast as I could

681
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.760
and there were two bright
orange eyes staring at me

682
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.420
just few feet away.

683
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.420
So I reached for my sidearm,
but it was just gone.

684
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:48.853
Do you know what it was?

685
00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:51.793
I don't either.

686
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.660
But I know it wasn't a raccoon
or a bear or a dog or a wolf.

687
00:39:04.746 --> 00:39:07.037
- That wasn't scary at all.

688
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.193
- It was a little scary.

689
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.200
- You don't scare easily?

690
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.417
- I get scared, but that wasn't scary.

691
00:39:15.417 --> 00:39:17.420
- Was the thing in the video scary?

692
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.969
- Kind of, but mostly 'cause
it's hard to tell what it is.

693
00:39:20.969 --> 00:39:22.140
- You're not scared here now?

694
00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.200
- Nope, I got everybody here.

695
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.653
Mom, dad, Troy, they
wouldn't let anything get me.

696
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.590
- So that still doesn't
explain how you met Mr. Sans.

697
00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.763
- You're right, it didn't end there.

698
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.010
You see, I never told
to do one at the station

699
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.313
what I saw that night,
not even my partner.

700
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.020
I was afraid that I would
get a psych eval or fired.

701
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.193
So I stayed silent.

702
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:50.480
About a week later,

703
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.663
Mrs. Apple and a man named
Collins came to visit.

704
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.370
They knew I saw something

705
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.993
and they were impressed that I survived.

706
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.483
So they offered me a new job.

707
00:40:05.324 --> 00:40:06.320
And a few months later,

708
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.563
I met Sans and we have
worked together ever since.

709
00:40:14.828 --> 00:40:15.745
- Well, it's getting late.

710
00:40:15.745 --> 00:40:18.253
I think I'm gonna get
the kids up to the house.

711
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.070
- Do you think I could have
Troy help me with my gear

712
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.170
before he goes?

713
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.410
I hear he's very good with cameras.

714
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.440
- Will you be okay?

715
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.633
- Yeah, mom, I'd like to help.

716
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.400
- Will you be staying?

717
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.300
- No, I'll be heading
home in a little while.

718
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.520
- Okay, well, before you leave,

719
00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.420
stop by the house and
let's have a cup of tea.

720
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.923
Carrie, say good night to Mrs. Apple.

721
00:40:39.923 --> 00:40:43.020
- Bye, Mrs. Apple.
- Bye, sweetie.

722
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.068
- Find me on Facebook, I wanna
learn how you talk to ghosts.

723
00:40:46.068 --> 00:40:47.151
- You got it.

724
00:40:52.303 --> 00:40:54.670
- I didn't get to see anything creepy.

725
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.213
- Maybe you'll get to see
something creepy tomorrow.

726
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.920
- I'm gonna need some space
to spread out my things.

727
00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:05.320
- Yeah, sure, there's a room
down the hall with a table

728
00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.570
that should work for you.

729
00:41:07.455 --> 00:41:08.883
Troy, would you mind helping her out?

730
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.740
- Call us if you need us.

731
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.753
- You're just itching to
shoot something, huh, Sans?

732
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.160
- I hate seeing him so scared like this.

733
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.460
It was never like him to
be afraid of everything.

734
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.643
- When did he change?

735
00:41:33.015 --> 00:41:34.730
- When got here about a year ago.

736
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.210
- Anything weird happen?

737
00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.310
Did he get lost or hurt?

738
00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:39.560
- No, nothing like that.

739
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.190
He did get really sick though.

740
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.290
- How sick?

741
00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.270
- Oh my gosh.

742
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.110
He had a fever, he was
throwing up every day.

743
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.830
Took him to the doctor,
they said it was a virus.

744
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:50.960
So aspirin and lots of
fluids, that type of thing.

745
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.960
But gosh, Linda and I,
we were really worried.

746
00:42:03.659 --> 00:42:06.760
- Wow, this is place is beautiful.

747
00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.900
It must've been gorgeous back in the day.

748
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.950
- Well, I mean, it's cool.

749
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.650
You know, some people wanna
come here and go on vacations

750
00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:14.900
or even get married here.

751
00:42:18.297 --> 00:42:19.130
- And...

752
00:42:20.164 --> 00:42:23.100
- What's the bug spray for?

753
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.050
- Bugs.

754
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.170
- Oh, I thought it was
some sort of ghost thing.

755
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.680
- Nope, just bugs.

756
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.240
No spray is gonna do anything to a ghost.

757
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.670
Here, check this out,

758
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.773
see how the battery and memory card looks.

759
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.680
It's just a regular camera.

760
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.140
The night mode will
pick stuff up sometimes,

761
00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.053
but mostly it just helps
you get around in the dark.

762
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.103
- So you do this a lot?

763
00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.150
Ghost hunting.

764
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.840
- Well, I don't really
necessarily think of it as hunting

765
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.070
because you can't do anything to a ghost.

766
00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.170
It's more like seeking or investigating.

767
00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:04.170
There's no jumpsuits,
plasma guns or ghost traps.

768
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:07.630
- So the seeking thing, do
you just like walk around

769
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.920
and ask questions in the dark?

770
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.240
- That's just on TV.

771
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.393
I just go in, stand still.

772
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.053
The conditions are right,
maybe something will happen.

773
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.293
Here, can you cut that open for me?

774
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.787
- You're saying something
in the barn made him sick?

775
00:43:27.787 --> 00:43:30.250
No, he was sick before we got here.

776
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.073
- But did he spend time here
in the farm after he got sick?

777
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.640
- I mean, yeah, I guess once
he started feeling better,

778
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.180
he wanted to come out and
explore, help me move some things.

779
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.610
What does it have to do with being sick?

780
00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.130
- He's an Indigo.

781
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:44.963
- Maybe.

782
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:47.290
- Indigo?

783
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.520
What's that?

784
00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.530
- Some people, usually kids,

785
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.200
pick up on supernatural energies.

786
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.410
Sometimes it happens
after they get real sick,

787
00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:58.978
bad fever, almost die.

788
00:43:58.978 --> 00:43:59.980
- In case it's like a real thing,

789
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.990
do I actually need to
see a doctor about it?

790
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.370
- No.

791
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:07.860
He may just be extra sensitive
to different energies.

792
00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:08.880
You take him to a doctor,

793
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.970
they're probably just gonna
give him pills or shots

794
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.653
or call it a mental illness.

795
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:17.503
- The shots are bad,
pills were okay sometimes.

796
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:19.960
- So when you say extra sensitive,

797
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.243
do you mean just like
afraid of everything?

798
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.930
- It's easy to be scared

799
00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.510
of something you don't
know anything about.

800
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:30.870
Hopefully he'll just
learn to deal with it.

801
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.090
- That's why Mrs. Apple is here.

802
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:34.217
You said she was the one
that showed up in the woods

803
00:44:34.217 --> 00:44:37.163
back when you saw that
thing when you were a cop.

804
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:41.260
She here to turn my son into
some kind of monster hunter?

805
00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.713
- Troy and I are gonna take
a walk and run some tests.

806
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:52.620
Why don't you go do some
baseline recordings for me?

807
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.620
- I'll start downstairs.

808
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.683
- We'll catch up.

809
00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.143
- How can he see?

810
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.403
- It's a long story.

811
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.130
- Let's go, young man.

812
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:05.880
We'll catch up with you guys later.

813
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.363
- Look, we're not here
to try to recruit him.

814
00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.943
We're here to check the
place for anything dangerous,

815
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.713
but I also think it's a
good idea to help Troy.

816
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.097
I suspected he was sensitive

817
00:45:22.097 --> 00:45:24.293
and I called Apple in just in case.

818
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.713
I think she can help him.

819
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:32.190
- Well, you guys got
him to come to the barn.

820
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.870
So that's always a step
in the right direction.

821
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.713
- I don't think that was just us.

822
00:45:37.617 --> 00:45:40.883
I think it was how you reacted
today and your example.

823
00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:45.933
He needs to see that people
don't have to be scared.

824
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.523
- He may not have seen
it, but I was terrified.

825
00:45:50.523 --> 00:45:52.580
I still am, not of the bear,

826
00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.173
but just for him and Carrie and Linda.

827
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:58.360
We're so far out here in the country,

828
00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.710
if anything were to happen,

829
00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:02.480
take a long time to get any help.

830
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.243
- I understand.

831
00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.103
Let's go find Sans.

832
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.547
- Tell me what you feel.

833
00:46:27.547 --> 00:46:29.823
- You mean here in the dark?

834
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.230
- No, I mean, what do you feel anytime?

835
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.653
- I'm scared all the time.

836
00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.560
- Do you know what's making you so scared?

837
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:40.140
- No, I'm just scared of this house,

838
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:43.883
the barn, the woods,
the water, everything.

839
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.623
- Why are you so afraid?

840
00:46:45.623 --> 00:46:47.633
- I don't know, I just am.

841
00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.080
- It's okay.

842
00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:51.373
Just relax for a minute.

843
00:46:54.059 --> 00:46:57.607
I want you to close
your eyes and just feel.

844
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.053
- I feel something.

845
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:11.233
It's weird.

846
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:13.073
Why is it glowing?

847
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.854
- There's energy here.

848
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:24.050
- Did you hear it?

849
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:25.833
- Yes.

850
00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.516
Let's go look.

851
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.156
- Are you hearing anything?

852
00:48:05.156 --> 00:48:07.087
- Static, and your loud ass.

853
00:48:08.324 --> 00:48:09.157
- Can I listen?

854
00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:20.749
- Wow, I can hear...

855
00:48:20.749 --> 00:48:22.310
I can hear the crickets outside.

856
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.040
Man, my voice is really loud.

857
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.560
- I know.

858
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.873
Listen to the room.

859
00:48:26.873 --> 00:48:28.073
What do you hear?

860
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:36.083
- Sans breathing, the wind outside,

861
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.943
maybe the waves in the bay,

862
00:48:42.573 --> 00:48:45.077
your stomach rumbling from
all those apples you ate.

863
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.323
Something else.

864
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.443
A rustling sound.

865
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.863
Metal clinking.

866
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.303
- I hear something.

867
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:11.623
Is somebody up here?

868
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:14.260
- What do you feel?

869
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.177
- I see someone, someone's up here.

870
00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:19.203
- But what do you feel?

871
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.610
Ghostly whisper

872
00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:23.443
- I have to go.

873
00:49:23.443 --> 00:49:25.890
- Wait, it's okay, Troy.

874
00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:27.020
You can face this.

875
00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:28.090
- No, I'm leaving.

876
00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:28.923
- Wait.

877
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.233
It's a young woman.

878
00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.103
Her name is Jean.
- Please, just let me go.

879
00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.643
- Jean Summers.

880
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.273
She lived or worked here long ago.

881
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:45.983
She found love here.

882
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.960
Lived her life, had children.

883
00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.243
- How do you know?

884
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.060
- It's clearly written in her energy.

885
00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.190
She loved it here.

886
00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:01.243
She likes to visit sometimes.

887
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:06.393
I think probably others do as well.

888
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.047
Why don't you close
your eyes and just feel.

889
00:50:33.462 --> 00:50:34.295
ghostly whispers

890
00:50:46.714 --> 00:50:48.187
- What happened?

891
00:50:48.187 --> 00:50:50.103
- You disrupted her energy.

892
00:50:56.070 --> 00:50:56.903
- So...

893
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.830
I can see ghosts now?

894
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.763
- Something happened to make
you able to sense things.

895
00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.830
- But nobody believes me,
mom and dad don't believe me.

896
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.280
I didn't wanna be here.

897
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.990
It didn't feel right,
but they never listen.

898
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:16.020
Nobody gets it.

899
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:16.853
I'm afraid.

900
00:51:16.853 --> 00:51:18.773
Why won't anybody listen to me?

901
00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.883
- Are you afraid though?

902
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.890
You just saw a ghost and
you even tried to touch it,

903
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.120
and you didn't run away

904
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.513
when you saw that creature
in the woods today.

905
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.983
Doesn't look like you're
that scared to me.

906
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:37.740
- Well, I guess not.

907
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.640
You knew about me, didn't you?

908
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:42.560
You're here for me.

909
00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:46.373
- Diego thought you might be sensitive.

910
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.650
She and Sans are pretty dense,

911
00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:53.660
but they have good
instincts most of the time.

912
00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:55.310
They asked me to check in on you.

913
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.653
- So what happens next?

914
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.610
- You practice it or you lock it down.

915
00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:07.070
It's your choice.

916
00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.293
- You mean I can block out
the feelings, the senses?

917
00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:12.423
- Most do.

918
00:52:17.614 --> 00:52:20.020
I think we've seen enough here tonight.

919
00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:21.720
Let's go catch up with the others.

920
00:52:23.577 --> 00:52:24.852
- Okay.

921
00:52:41.934 --> 00:52:42.767
- Everything okay?

922
00:52:42.767 --> 00:52:43.810
- Yeah, it's cool.

923
00:52:43.810 --> 00:52:45.750
- Find anything interesting?

924
00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.750
- Oh, well, just some minor energies.

925
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.150
Nothing to worry about.

926
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.350
- Minor energies as in ghosts?

927
00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:54.940
- It's okay, dad, it's just
memories from the past.

928
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.193
I guess I was just scared
of all this history stuff.

929
00:52:59.930 --> 00:53:03.010
- Well, I think I am
going to go to the house

930
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.180
and have a cup of tea with Linda.

931
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.290
Will you walk with me?

932
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:07.123
- Sure.

933
00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:15.643
- Troy.

934
00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.680
Did you see a ghost?

935
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.620
- Oh, yes.

936
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.980
There was this big scary one
stomping around everywhere.

937
00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.330
I even got it on camera.

938
00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:28.250
Mr. Sans says it was the
biggest, scariest ghost

939
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:29.658
you've ever seen.

940
00:53:29.658 --> 00:53:33.580
- Okay, but seriously,
did you see a ghost?

941
00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:35.943
- Are you sure you wanna know if I did?

942
00:53:35.943 --> 00:53:38.544
- I don't know, maybe.

943
00:53:38.544 --> 00:53:39.377
- Maybe.

944
00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.739
- What creatures have you seen?

945
00:54:02.739 --> 00:54:03.760
- Depends on what you call a creature.

946
00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.840
- You know, big foots and yetis and stuff.

947
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.160
- Big foot is a yeti.

948
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.380
Big foot came across the last ice age,

949
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.230
he's kind of an explorer.

950
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:13.800
- There's only one?

951
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.870
- There's only one here,

952
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:17.650
but there's a bunch of
yetis in the Himalayas.

953
00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:18.970
- How old are they?

954
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.550
- I didn't think to ask.

955
00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:22.740
I wanna look at that tree line.

956
00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.907
- You're weird, Mr. Sans.

957
00:54:23.907 --> 00:54:25.398
- And you're adopted.

958
00:54:25.398 --> 00:54:26.231
- What!

959
00:54:26.231 --> 00:54:27.790
- I wanna look at these trees over here.

960
00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:29.110
Try to keep up, kid.

961
00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:30.560
- He's just messing with you.

962
00:54:32.098 --> 00:54:33.006
- Harpy!

963
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:43.503
- What were you shooting at?

964
00:54:43.503 --> 00:54:45.800
- He saw a hippy.

965
00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.360
- I think he said harpy.

966
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.513
It's a bird woman, right?

967
00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.280
- It wasn't a harpy.

968
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.900
- What was it?

969
00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.000
- It was a goose.

970
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.770
- How do you mistake a goose
for a harpy in broad daylight?

971
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.860
A goose doesn't look
anything like a harpy,

972
00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:01.800
it doesn't have...

973
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.940
Really?

974
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.090
- It was an ugly goose.

975
00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:11.950
- Did he hit it?

976
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.560
- Not even close.

977
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.843
- It was an ugly goose.

978
00:55:14.843 --> 00:55:16.426
- It was very ugly.

979
00:55:30.013 --> 00:55:31.293
- So what happens now?

980
00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.063
- Depends on you.

981
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.610
Did Mrs. Apple help?

982
00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.200
- I think so.

983
00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.980
I just want people to stop
bugging my mom and dad.

984
00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:41.813
- Well, you know what,

985
00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:43.850
we'll send out a message
to some of our friends

986
00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.710
and they'll find something else

987
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:47.413
for the SpookTubers to focus on.

988
00:55:55.890 --> 00:56:00.100
- Ms. Diego, Mr. Sans, thank
you guys so much for staying

989
00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.100
and for all of the excitement.

990
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.633
- Maybe you two can come back
and get married or something.

991
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.233
- Bye.

992
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.357
- Well, they were interesting.

993
00:56:19.357 --> 00:56:21.550
- But what about Troy's video?

994
00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.130
Are we gonna catch a break
from all the weirdos?

995
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:27.440
- Hopefully if Ms. Diego said
something to their people.

996
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:28.273
Probably wouldn't hurt

997
00:56:28.273 --> 00:56:30.670
if he started posting about
a different topic as well.

998
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.770
Think he'd be willing to help
me on my tractor channel?

999
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:34.320
- Give him some time.

1000
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.363
I think he needs some distance
away from all the weirdness.

1001
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.020
- You gonna make a video?

1002
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.630
- No, I'm probably gonna take a break.

1003
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.760
Too many haters out there
to pick apart my videos.

1004
00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:01.710
- But you did catch something,
you can't say it's fake.

1005
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:03.280
- Well, that's the thing,

1006
00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:06.483
if you stop posting, then
people stop watching.

1007
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.723
- You mean like the
Freekie-707's Elf in a Box?

1008
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:12.423
- Maybe.

1009
00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.140
- Can you help me make a makeup video?

1010
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.940
- Well, I don't know if makeup
will help much, but okay.

1011
00:57:19.887 --> 00:57:21.410
- Hey!

1012
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:24.360
- Look, you go film something
and I'll help you edit later.

1013
00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.834
I'm gonna go shoot some hoops.

1014
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.882
Girl!

1015
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:45.190
- Today, I'm gonna be talking
about what animals to-

1016
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:47.949
- Hey, babe, I'm gonna lock up
the barn, I'll be right back.

1017
00:57:47.949 --> 00:57:48.782
- Okay.

1018
00:57:56.524 --> 00:57:57.357
Distant chanting

1019
00:57:59.490 --> 00:58:00.323
- Hey!

1020
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:02.103
Hello!

1021
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.070
Private property, if you wanna explore,

1022
00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.003
you need to come check
in with us in the house.

1023
00:59:12.512 --> 00:59:15.853
- Mom, dad, you guys in here?

1024
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:18.713
Carrie, are you here?

1025
01:00:29.498 --> 01:00:30.331
- Easy, kid.

1026
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:33.091
It's okay, it's okay.

1027
01:00:35.091 --> 01:00:40.023
- Ms. Diego, Mr. Sans,
I thought you guys left.

1028
01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.980
Everybody's gone and I saw these people,

1029
01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.113
I think they took them into the barn.

1030
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:49.463
- We saw, kid.

1031
01:00:49.463 --> 01:00:50.560
That's why we're here.

1032
01:00:51.610 --> 01:00:53.170
- You saw them?

1033
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:56.670
- We set up wireless trail
cameras to watch the back area.

1034
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:59.840
We were gonna come collect
'em in a month or two.

1035
01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.890
- Diego thought we
should do a system check.

1036
01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:04.490
We were going down the road,
that's when we saw 'em.

1037
01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.740
- You saw what happened?

1038
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.440
- Several figures going into the barn.

1039
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:13.240
One of 'em was carrying your sister.

1040
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:16.500
- My phone was busted so
I couldn't call the cops

1041
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.220
and dad's gun was gone too.

1042
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.967
I have to go help them.

1043
01:01:20.967 --> 01:01:21.800
- No.

1044
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.900
We put a call in, we have to move.

1045
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.733
You stay here.

1046
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.127
- You hear that?

1047
01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:34.520
- No, this is not the time.

1048
01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.100
Look, we have a family in danger,

1049
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.550
this is not the time for
you to go all Rambo on me.

1050
01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:40.800
- Dammit, Diego.
- I know.

1051
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.710
You'll get your chance, after.

1052
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:44.543
We gotta move.

1053
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.263
What are you doing?

1054
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:06.783
Damn it!

1055
01:02:08.251 --> 01:02:10.140
- He must have went in alone.

1056
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:10.973
- Idiot.

1057
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.320
- Seems pretty brave to me.

1058
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:14.863
- Not him, you.

1059
01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.200
We need to split up.

1060
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.290
You go right, I'll go left.

1061
01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.476
- Roger that.

1062
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:08.261
chanting

1063
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:36.653
Oh, what the hell.

1064
01:04:09.785 --> 01:04:11.179
Diego, where are you?

1065
01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:12.553
- I'm behind you,

1066
01:04:12.553 --> 01:04:15.052
but, go, we need to hurry!

1067
01:04:28.601 --> 01:04:29.751
- Troy, help me!

1068
01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:30.918
Help me, Troy!

1069
01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.453
- Thanks, partner.

1070
01:05:03.453 --> 01:05:04.286
- Tired of saving your ass.

1071
01:05:24.738 --> 01:05:26.954
- No! Come Back!

1072
01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:37.338
- You little shit!
- No!

1073
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.793
- I just came out to close up the barn.

1074
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:13.403
Next thing I know, I'm
waking up with my hands tied.

1075
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:17.683
The Crypto Hunters.

1076
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.493
Mr. Sans, Ms. Diego,

1077
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.630
they said they were gonna kill us.

1078
01:06:26.118 --> 01:06:27.218
And Troy stopped them.

1079
01:06:29.705 --> 01:06:31.003
Now he won't talk about it.

1080
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:35.530
- What do you mean, he
won't talk about it?

1081
01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.243
- He hasn't said anything since .... this.

1082
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:42.550
- Could be shock.

1083
01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.450
I'll check back for a statement later.

1084
01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.000
But Diego's pretty solid and
she says your son helped,

1085
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.650
then she means it.

1086
01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:52.760
Good thing to Crypto Hunters were here.

1087
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.030
- Yeah, I guess so.

1088
01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:57.953
- That asshole killed my cat.

1089
01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:00.590
- I'm sorry, Ms. Morgan.

1090
01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:01.990
I'll add that to the report.

1091
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:21.633
- Now you said no fatalities by you?

1092
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:24.675
- No Cryptos, no fatalities.

1093
01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:25.530
- How?

1094
01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:27.180
- We saw they were Nervii,

1095
01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.970
so we loaded some
non-lethals and zip-ties.

1096
01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:31.710
There's some more around the
back of the barn, by the way.

1097
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.983
- What the hell is a Nervii?

1098
01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.890
- They're Druids or jackasses

1099
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.690
that think that they're druids.

1100
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.180
They saw the Morgans
were gonna be here alone,

1101
01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:44.530
so they thought they would
have some satanic ritual,

1102
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:47.910
raise the dead, blood orgy shit.

1103
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:49.443
Get some kind of eternal power.

1104
01:07:53.241 --> 01:07:54.491
- Did they raise a demon?

1105
01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:56.303
- Almost.

1106
01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.237
- And this guy?

1107
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.263
- Shaving accident.

1108
01:08:04.096 --> 01:08:05.674
- Oh.

1109
01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.540
- Sans told me what he saw.

1110
01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.740
You wanna talk about it?

1111
01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:21.983
Okay.

1112
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.680
When things settle, shoot me an email,

1113
01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.430
and we'll set something up for you.

1114
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.113
The world's gonna look very different now.

1115
01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:35.430
They're never gonna understand
what you did tonight

1116
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:36.533
or what it cost you.

1117
01:08:38.376 --> 01:08:39.893
But don't let that eat you up.

1118
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.803
We'll find a way to get you through this.

1119
01:08:46.410 --> 01:08:50.110
You did something
remarkably brave tonight.

1120
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:52.480
Your family is alive because of it.

1121
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.890
- Diego called.

1122
01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:39.033
Said you finished your training,
said you're ready to hunt.

1123
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:45.113
You got bigger, but
you got a lot to learn.

1124
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:47.833
So, gear up, rook, we got a case!

1125
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.560
- So basically it's been
five years since TroJam's

1126
01:10:41.393 --> 01:10:42.730
video went viral.

1127
01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:45.840
I knew he was fraud all
along, they all are.

1128
01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.170
I was the only one who saw anything

1129
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:50.700
and I've got the real thing right here.

1130
01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:53.387
And you guys say that
it's not real, but it is.

1131
01:10:53.387 --> 01:10:56.490
It has been verified by a former hunter

1132
01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.610
and he says that I have to keep it quiet.

1133
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:59.690
Screw that!

1134
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:00.930
I'm gonna be famous,

1135
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:03.020
I'm gonna be on all the shows like-

1136
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.610
- Georgie, there's
someone here to see you!

1137
01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:07.970
- Mom, I'm recording a vlog.

1138
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.580
Tell them I'm busy!

1139
01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:13.039
- I know, Georgie, but
Georgie, what's a dry ass?

1140
01:11:13.039 --> 01:11:14.320
- Dryad, mom!

1141
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.440
- It's pronounced Dryad.

1142
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.910
- Right, that's what the man

1143
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.480
said he wanted to talk about,

1144
01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.314
says his name is Sans, you know him?

1145
01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:23.975
- Oh, shit!
- Where's the Dryad?

1146
01:11:23.975 --> 01:11:25.295
- I-
- Cobra pig!

1147
01:11:36.712 --> 01:11:39.166
You got anything to say here?
