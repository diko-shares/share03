1
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.240
Trampled by the dark army of Fury
and scorched by the dragon's breath

2
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.455
The peace and harmony
between the 12 kingdoms of

3
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.632
Nazroth is little more
than a distant memory.

4
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.993
Emerging from the chaos and
surrounded by the stench of death

5
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.836
The Princess of Zaldah has survived
the destruction of her castle.

6
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.798
Armed with a powerful dragon egg
snatched from the rubble of her castle

7
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.670
And the knowledge that her brother
is behind the army of fury bloods

8
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.592
She must save her people

9
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.149
There's a war coming.

10
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.758
Giving her strength are her most
loyal and courageous Royal Knights

11
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.695
Joining forces with Katori
Warrior Women to stop their

12
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.873
common enemy Prince Favian from
conquering the entire realm.

13
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.909
Kingdoms will fall, crushed
beneath the feet of

14
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.555
a thousand and torched
by unstoppable dragons.

15
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.310
Out of the ashes a Kingdom will rise.

16
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.910
H's amply

17
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.829
Where is everyone?

18
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.391
[Loud distant snarls]

19
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.750
Stay behind me Princess

20
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.917
Our blows only seem to slow them George.

21
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.870
As do our Hades

22
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.514
It's like they don't feel pain.

23
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.918
Can weapons not harm them?

24
00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:41.786
They don't know their injuries.

25
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.510
Take thew heads

26
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.831
Then let us cut off their
heads and be done with it.

27
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.230
[Scream]

28
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.915
So that's how we kill them.

29
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.754
Search the building for weapons.

30
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.478
Drag the bodies into the
barn, lock the door.

31
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.430
[sigh]

32
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.918
How much more of that stuff are you
going to put on me? It stinks.

33
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.435
The more we apply the faster we'll heal.

34
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.750
Would you prefer I stop?

35
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.592
[Sigh] If you put it like that.

36
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.957
Then enough of your moaning

37
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.993
You have a healing touch Your Highness.

38
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.110
And a good stitch.

39
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.150
Thank you

40
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560
We need to get you out of those clothes.

41
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.992
I mean, you shouldn't look like royalty.

42
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.999
We'll attract unwanted attention.

43
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.439
Yes. these clothes do seem less
appropriate now than ever before.

44
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.237
There'll be many desperate
people on the road.

45
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.875
Not just the My

46
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.758
Anyone could be working with Prince Favian.

47
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.671
There'll be a high price on
your head Your Highness.

48
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.919
I saw some clothes in the
cottages, you should gel changed

49
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.998
[Breath] How did Favian
even get these eggs.

50
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.433
And what is he using them for?

51
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.956
I don't know but I don't like it.

52
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.917
- There is the power in [he eggs of dragons
- No good ever came from using magic.

53
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.556
And even having that thing
near us is bad luck.

54
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.589
It must have something to
do with the fury bloods

55
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.836
or maybe he's trying to
raise a dragon army.

56
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.558
That would make him incredibly powerful.

57
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.594
No one has ever enslaved a dragon.

58
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.913
No ones ever found a dragons egg before

59
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.190
What d'you mean?

60
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.559
The dragons are believed to
live in the jagged mountains.

61
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.238
Beyond the volcanoes and rivers
of lava, they are impossible

62
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.159
to cross by man and the mountains
too treacherous to climb.

63
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.712
And the seas either side
are too perilous that no

64
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.593
ship's captain will ever
dare to navigate them.

65
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.375
Well. we know Favian
is commanding the fury

66
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.756
and he seeks to wrest
the throne from father.

67
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.879
But how is he doing it'?

68
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.274
There is another. one who
is yet to reveal himself.

69
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.350
There must be.

70
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.639
Favian doesnâ€™t have the knowledge
or power to do this on his own.

71
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.350
Or the courage

72
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.950
What is that'?

73
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.476
It came from the dragon
that destroyed the castle

74
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.875
Get some sleep, at first light
we push to the Northern Castle.

75
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.355
I'll take first watch.

76
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.190
Wan! some company George?

77
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.472
No, rest up old friend

78
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.514
[Snore]

79
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.557
[Bigger snore. grunting and sniffing]

80
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.750
[Startled grunt]

81
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.595
[Grunting loudly]

82
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.591
[Shari]

83
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.510
[Grunt then choking]

84
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.390
[Grunt then pained snarls]

85
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.919
[Sword fight and snarls continue]

86
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:11.121
George. Dimia.

87
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.560
Thank god we found ya

88
00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:23.195
[Grunt]

89
00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:28.514
You're the King's Knights

90
00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:30.835
You were at the Inn.

91
00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:33.165
Everyone we're safe

92
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:35.600
You have to save us

93
00:11:38.405 --> 00:11:39.395
What happened'?

94
00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:48.323
Kettlage was overrun by [he restless dead
These furies

95
00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:50.358
Killed so many of us.

96
00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:55.244
We lost our daughter. Please help us.

97
00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:56.795
Where are you headed?

98
00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:02.762
To the King's Western Castle if it
pleases you ma'am. We'll be safe there.

99
00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:05.238
The King's army will protect us.

100
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.115
What's wrong'?

101
00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.121
Please let us shelter within
the safety of the walls

102
00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:22.517
Please you have to protect us.

103
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:27.236
- Please, sirs. Don't leave us to die.
- Please. please. have mercy.

104
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:29.203
- We are honorable people
- Enough.

105
00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.478
The castle has been destroyed.

106
00:12:37.565 --> 00:12:39.078
You'll find no refuge there.

107
00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:41.360
All this way for nothing.

108
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:44.900
Lies. They don't want to help us.
Nothing can

109
00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:47.485
bring down the castle walls
not even these fury.

110
00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.082
What Sir George says is true

111
00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:54.122
The castle was overrun
and completely destroyed

112
00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:58.240
You must come with us to the North Castle,
that is the only way you will be safe.

113
00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.279
What could destroy the castle?

114
00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:02.764
[Dragon screech and screams]

115
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:04.795
Here

116
00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:10.243
<i>[Long scream]</i>

117
00:13:11.285 --> 00:13:12.275
[Squeal]

118
00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:15.917
[Big roar] It's come back for the egg.

119
00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.679
Then we give it what it wants

120
00:13:31.285 --> 00:13:34.357
<i>[BM roar]</i>

121
00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:47.438
[Big angry roar]

122
00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:05.602
[River]

123
00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:29.554
I told you all that thing would
bring us nothing but trouble.

124
00:14:34.245 --> 00:14:35.235
Good riddance

125
00:14:36.685 --> 00:14:38.244
Until it comes back again.

126
00:14:41.085 --> 00:14:43.599
[River]

127
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.594
They need lo wait here

128
00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:11.634
You need to see this

129
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.399
Dimia, stay with the Princess.

130
00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:31.802
[Snarling]

131
00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:46.395
What's wrong'?

132
00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:50.801
Furies. as far as the eye can see and
they're heading straight towards us.

133
00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:55.275
What are we to do?

134
00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.605
We're gonna die. We're all gonna die.

135
00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.004
Ooh. we've lost everything.

136
00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.564
I knew we shouldn't have
gone this way, I told you!

137
00:16:06.325 --> 00:16:09.300
- Like we should have gone down to-
- I am the townsman and you do as I say.

138
00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:10.440
Stop fighting.

139
00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:18.120
Stop fighting.

140
00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:21.835
What are we gonna do?

141
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.640
What are we going to do'?

142
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.039
We're out off, there's no my through

143
00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:33.765
There must be thousands of them.

144
00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:37.276
This was the Prince's plan all along.
To surround

145
00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:39.396
us and finish off everyone
who's not loyal to him.

146
00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:43.960
How do we get to the Northern Castle?
We have to warn father.

147
00:16:44.485 --> 00:16:47.523
We need to protect the people of
our kingdom. of all the kingdoms.

148
00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:51.156
Favian wants us to bow at his
feet, we mustnâ€™t let him win.

149
00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.364
Maybe we head back to Kalon

150
00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:04.075
D'you think we'll make it?

151
00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:06.642
Favian surely has the
Kingdom surrounded by now.

152
00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:09.754
I just have this sick feeling
that inside of me that we are

153
00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:12.234
not fighting with our Katori
sisters to the final toll

154
00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.557
As do I. But what shame do we have?

155
00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:23.878
These are unbearable odds George

156
00:17:25.605 --> 00:17:29.838
We can't go back north. Now we
can't go south. W-What now?

157
00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:33.357
East. To the coast and safety by the sea.

158
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.842
No means in which to buy passage.

159
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.796
Here. Take this

160
00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.060
Give this to the captain
of the Kings Armada.

161
00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:46.883
Tell him to set sail for the Red Islands.

162
00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:51.715
And to take you there to safety. Tell him
to remain there until he gets more orders.

163
00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:55.322
Just make sure that he takes the
whole Armada from the land.

164
00:17:57.765 --> 00:17:59.365
- You're not going to come with us?
- No!

165
00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:03.202
Our path leads into darkness.
You'll be safer on the seas.

166
00:18:03.805 --> 00:18:04.795
[Big sigh]

167
00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:06.475
Let me come with you

168
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:10.995
I can help.

169
00:18:11.845 --> 00:18:12.835
I can become a Knight

170
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.360
To become a Knight takes years
of dedication and training.

171
00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:17.200
We began at childhood.

172
00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:22.559
You're a townsman, your
responsibility is to these people.

173
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.115
- But you take Katori with you.
- I said no.

174
00:18:30.365 --> 00:18:32.959
It's. err. it's Bryce.
it's Bryce isn't it'?

175
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:37.520
Part of being a Knight is obeying orders even
if those orders are disagreeable to you.

176
00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:41.045
What is the best way to get to the castle?

177
00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:44.039
We go through The Dark Kingdom.

178
00:18:48.725 --> 00:18:50.921
The Dark Kingdom is an evil place.

179
00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:53.715
No-one of sane mind has
ventured into that land.

180
00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.199
H's the mos! direct mute

181
00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:59.041
The fury are closing in, we have no choice.

182
00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:02.124
But George... The Dark Kingdom...

183
00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:05.805
No-one has ever survived The Dark Kingdom.

184
00:19:18.285 --> 00:19:22.165
The air is thick with whispers,
talk of overthrowing the King

185
00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:25.875
Ssssh. the very bricks of this
castle listen for deceit.

186
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:30.398
The bricks may Helen bu! so do
I, there are changes coming.

187
00:19:30.525 --> 00:19:34.041
You speak of treason. You want us killed'?

188
00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:27.045
Your Majesty, you wished
to hear the report.

189
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:32.555
Your majesty?

190
00:20:33.285 --> 00:20:34.275
[Mmm?]

191
00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:35.760
Forgive me Commander.

192
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.959
My mind is with my wife, the Queen

193
00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:43.916
I fear she gets weaker by the day

194
00:20:45.725 --> 00:20:46.760
You were saying}

195
00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:49.961
We have not had word
from the Western Castle.

196
00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:53.364
The messenger's um! we
sen! has not returned and

197
00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.874
we fear for the Prince
and Princess' safety.

198
00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:57.640
Their safely?

199
00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:01.123
But we sent a whole battalion there?

200
00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:05.202
What if George and his
men weren't successful?

201
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.200
What if the dragon has
destroyed [he castle?

202
00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:12.800
What of my daughter'?

203
00:21:14.325 --> 00:21:15.838
What if... if...

204
00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:21.719
No need to worry Father.

205
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:26.803
The Western Castle is safe and
secure as am I and sister.

206
00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:28.275
Favian.

207
00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:30.599
What are you doing here?

208
00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:34.398
wanted lo be close to you and mother

209
00:21:35.645 --> 00:21:37.044
Where is the battalion.

210
00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:40.900
I do not need any battalion
to hide behind Father.

211
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.202
I would brave any danger
to be at Mothers side.

212
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:49.160
The battalion remains with
the people at the castle.

213
00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:53.323
An old heart warms with
your gallantry my son.

214
00:21:56.805 --> 00:21:58.034
But Favian...

215
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.276
Where is Elizabeth?

216
00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.641
Do you believe all the stories
of The Dark Kingdom?

217
00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:08.078
They're not just stories Your Highness.

218
00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:11.196
Those who have ventured
in have never returned.

219
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.274
Only their screams.

220
00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:14.955
M's true

221
00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:18.001
The Katori know of many
souls lost to that place.

222
00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:20.357
What are these myths you tell of?

223
00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:25.756
Myths! Huh! The legend tells of a
sorcery by the name of the Magister.

224
00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:28.878
And he descended into the
deepest and darkest valley.

225
00:22:29.285 --> 00:22:35.042
Once he was there he used his powers to create
such abhorrent abominations of creatures

226
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:39.155
The strange mist fell on the land
and for two hundred years the name

227
00:22:39.205 --> 00:22:42.561
'The Dark Kingdom' has struck fear
in the heart of the innocents.

228
00:22:43.765 --> 00:22:46.598
And yet. that is where we are headed.

229
00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:49.441
Bu! it can! be (me, can it?

230
00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:51.804
That is the stuff of nightmares.

231
00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:56.595
No-one knows, no-one living anyway

232
00:23:10.565 --> 00:23:12.044
[Hawk screech]

233
00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:52.438
Maul you to leach me how to fight

234
00:23:56.565 --> 00:23:59.318
if half the legends are true
I'll need to be of better use.

235
00:24:00.365 --> 00:24:01.355
As you wish.

236
00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:05.519
Richard, swords

237
00:24:13.725 --> 00:24:16.763
Take the sword. Hold it like this.

238
00:24:17.565 --> 00:24:19.954
It has to become part of
you, not something you hold.

239
00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:22.042
Let the weight move with
you. not against you.

240
00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:25.917
Now draw it into your
body and lean forward.

241
00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:31.199
Many attacker will charge you down.
With the blade

242
00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:33.555
in this position. it'll
surely find its mark.

243
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.437
From here, you defend

244
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:41.715
Good

245
00:24:42.925 --> 00:24:43.915
You ready?

246
00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:48.315
Good

247
00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:51.400
Use your body and footwork
to avoid the News.

248
00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:54.635
Show me

249
00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:57.595
Attack

250
00:25:00.605 --> 00:25:01.595
Try.

251
00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:06.555
Good

252
00:25:24.765 --> 00:25:27.405
[intimidating roar]

253
00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:34.234
[Aggressive scream]

254
00:25:46.285 --> 00:25:49.562
[Terrified scream]

255
00:25:49.645 --> 00:25:50.635
[Scared gasp]

256
00:26:34.165 --> 00:26:35.564
Sirens!

257
00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:44.076
Fish. Fishy Puh. Tuh.. Sc good [snore]

258
00:27:38.725 --> 00:27:42.798
[Deep roars]

259
00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:48.961
There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

260
00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:50.355
Goon

261
00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:53.677
The stable girl I talked of...

262
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:56.316
- Elizabeth and I we-
- [Laugh]

263
00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:57.800
I know.

264
00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:00.195
How long have you known'?

265
00:28:00.565 --> 00:28:03.034
I wasn't sure until we were
in the castle two nights ago.

266
00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:08.795
It wasn't supposed to happen. A Knight and
a Princess. that's why I kept it a secret.

267
00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:10.683
There'll be many that will disapprove.

268
00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:12.514
But not you my friend?

269
00:28:12.805 --> 00:28:17.800
No. But we have a treacherous road
ahead, you must have a clear head.

270
00:28:20.725 --> 00:28:22.716
You weren't asleep last night, were you'?

271
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.639
No.

272
00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:28.675
Always protecting me. even from myself.

273
00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:31.240
Always Sir. Always.

274
00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:02.801
Do you think the King
suspects anything is amiss?

275
00:29:03.245 --> 00:29:04.724
It's possible My Lord.

276
00:29:05.005 --> 00:29:05.995
Possible?

277
00:29:06.525 --> 00:29:08.482
[Screech]
Instruct the Magister...

278
00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:12.120
To have our Furies ready

279
00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:15.598
To stand outside the castle gates

280
00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:22.395
We must ensure that my dear
sister and her beloved Knights...

281
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.115
Are finished.

282
00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:29.238
There is still no sign of her,
nor of Sir George or Sir Richard.

283
00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:32.519
Wan! them found

284
00:29:33.725 --> 00:29:37.434
Tell the Magister to send
Furies that have known them.

285
00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:44.277
Anyone turned that knows how
these Knights think find

286
00:29:45.565 --> 00:29:48.159
[Screeching]
And destroy them

287
00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:50.003
As you command My Lord

288
00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:54.475
What is it?

289
00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:59.203
Nothing. I hear no birds. No animals.

290
00:29:59.845 --> 00:30:00.960
No insects

291
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.115
We're here

292
00:30:04.205 --> 00:30:06.116
The threshold of The Dark Kingdom.

293
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.882
A place of no! day nor night

294
00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:10.400
I don't like it.

295
00:30:12.045 --> 00:30:13.274
None of us do

296
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:15.915
Whatta we do now?

297
00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:22.321
Prepare yourselves, once we cross the
boundary there'll be no turning back.

298
00:30:30.885 --> 00:30:32.034
Are you ready Knight?

299
00:30:33.205 --> 00:30:35.845
I could have died happy in
the arms of that Siren.

300
00:30:36.445 --> 00:30:37.799
We move quickly and quietly.

301
00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:40.443
We mustn't attract any attention.

302
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:20.995
What is it?

303
00:31:23.245 --> 00:31:26.044
Large Heavy

304
00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:29.076
Tracks are maybe two or three hours old.

305
00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:33.035
H's a Demon

306
00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:39.118
Mailers not. The tracks lead in
the other direction. Let's go.

307
00:31:46.885 --> 00:31:49.001
The Kingdom is overrun with Fury

308
00:31:50.005 --> 00:31:52.315
Fury' those are just stones

309
00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:57.156
Ne. Ne, no, no they're real. They
killed my daughter. And my husband

310
00:31:58.685 --> 00:31:59.675
M's true

311
00:32:00.205 --> 00:32:03.197
Our Village and the Western
Castle have been destroyed.

312
00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:05.799
Where are the King's messengers?

313
00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:07.200
Likely killed.

314
00:32:08.645 --> 00:32:11.717
The Royal Knights, they
told me to give you this.

315
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:14.700
Please.

316
00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:16.124
You must help us.

317
00:32:16.325 --> 00:32:19.955
They said to set sail for The Red Islands.

318
00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:21.275
Captain?

319
00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:28.119
Whose blood is this?

320
00:32:28.925 --> 00:32:30.245
My husband's.

321
00:32:31.685 --> 00:32:37.363
He's just... he was just an Inn Keeper
and he couldn't fight off these Fury.

322
00:32:38.205 --> 00:32:39.559
We has! everything

323
00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:43.884
We have our orders We make haste

324
00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:45.999
For The Red Islands

325
00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:10.235
What is it?

326
00:33:10.645 --> 00:33:11.635
We're being watched

327
00:33:11.725 --> 00:33:12.840
[Rasping roar]
Take cover.

328
00:33:20.085 --> 00:33:24.238
[Manacing roar]

329
00:33:25.725 --> 00:33:28.478
[Roars]

330
00:33:35.085 --> 00:33:36.280
[Big angry roar]

331
00:33:37.045 --> 00:33:40.959
[Very big distant roar]
[Rasping roar]

332
00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:50.157
Let': leave before that thing comes back

333
00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:54.445
What ms that?

334
00:33:55.045 --> 00:34:00.723
I do not know, nor do I care to know. Nor do
I wish to find out what it was afraid of.

335
00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.003
That's what we all should be afraid of.

336
00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:04.835
This is magic

337
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.604
Let's get out of this place.

338
00:34:21.925 --> 00:34:26.362
Search your rotten minds, seek
out your old commander George.

339
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:31.839
Find him and the Princess wherever they
hide. Do not rest until they are dead.

340
00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.363
I can't believe Bryce left us.

341
00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:45.278
He's selfish, some townsman he is

342
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.118
He has his own demons.

343
00:34:47.405 --> 00:34:50.363
I'll need you to come to the
Captain and tell us why we are

344
00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:53.158
headed for The Red Islands and
my we have you on board

345
00:35:02.485 --> 00:35:04.556
You must tell me about these Fury.

346
00:35:04.965 --> 00:35:08.083
- Look, we have run for our lives.
- The Knights told us to come to you.

347
00:35:08.365 --> 00:35:10.003
To protect the people of Xaldah.

348
00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:17.601
We're on the brink and only our actions
will ensure the future of our Kingdom.

349
00:36:19.925 --> 00:36:21.324
You wish to see me Father.

350
00:36:24.925 --> 00:36:27.565
It is customary to knock before you enter.

351
00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:31.636
Your messenger said it was
urgent so no time to waste

352
00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:37.044
I prefer to stand and take in the room.

353
00:36:39.205 --> 00:36:40.275
Sit.

354
00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:51.442
There is something you are not telling me.

355

The rocks were actually alive.

387
00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:51.124
Maybe we should be more mindful of
the interpretations of the legends.

And they are what will
gain me your Kingdom.
