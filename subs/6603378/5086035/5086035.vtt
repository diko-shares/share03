WEBVTT

1
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.240
Trampled by the dark army of Fury
and scorched by the dragon's breath

2
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.455
The peace and harmony
between the 12 kingdoms of

3
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.632
Nazroth is little more
than a distant memory.

4
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.993
Emerging from the chaos and
surrounded by the stench of death

5
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.836
The Princess of Zaldah has survived
the destruction of her castle.

6
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.798
Armed with a powerful dragon egg
snatched from the rubble of her castle

7
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.670
And the knowledge that her brother
is behind the army of fury bloods

8
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.592
She must save her people

9
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.149
There's a war coming.

10
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.758
Giving her strength are her most
loyal and courageous Royal Knights

11
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.695
Joining forces with Katori
Warrior Women to stop their

12
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.873
common enemy Prince Favian from
conquering the entire realm.

13
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.909
Kingdoms will fall, crushed
beneath the feet of

14
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.555
a thousand and torched
by unstoppable dragons.

15
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.310
Out of the ashes a Kingdom will rise.

16
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.910
H's amply

17
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.829
Where is everyone?

18
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.750
Stay behind me Princess

19
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.917
Our blows only seem to slow them George.

20
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.870
As do our Hades

21
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.514
It's like they don't feel pain.

22
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.918
Can weapons not harm them?

23
00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:41.786
They don't know their injuries.

24
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.510
Take thew heads

25
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.831
Then let us cut off their
heads and be done with it.

26
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.915
So that's how we kill them.

27
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.754
Search the building for weapons.

28
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.478
Drag the bodies into the
barn, lock the door.

29
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.918
How much more of that stuff are you
going to put on me? It stinks.

30
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.435
The more we apply the faster we'll heal.

31
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.750
Would you prefer I stop?

32
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.592
If you put it like that.

33
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.957
Then enough of your moaning

34
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.993
You have a healing touch Your Highness.

35
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.110
And a good stitch.

36
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.150
Thank you

37
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.560
We need to get you out of those clothes.

38
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.992
I mean, you shouldn't look like royalty.

39
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.999
We'll attract unwanted attention.

40
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.439
Yes. these clothes do seem less
appropriate now than ever before.

41
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.237
There'll be many desperate
people on the road.

42
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.875
Not just the My

43
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.758
Anyone could be working with Prince Favian.

44
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.671
There'll be a high price on
your head Your Highness.

45
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.919
I saw some clothes in the
cottages, you should gel changed

46
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.998
How did Favian even get these eggs.

47
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.433
And what is he using them for?

48
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.956
I don't know but I don't like it.

49
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.917
- There is the power in [he eggs of dragons
- No good ever came from using magic.

50
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.556
And even having that thing
near us is bad luck.

51
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.589
It must have something to
do with the fury bloods

52
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.836
or maybe he's trying to
raise a dragon army.

53
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.558
That would make him incredibly powerful.

54
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.594
No one has ever enslaved a dragon.

55
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.913
No ones ever found a dragons egg before

56
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.190
What d'you mean?

57
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.559
The dragons are believed to
live in the jagged mountains.

58
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.238
Beyond the volcanoes and rivers
of lava, they are impossible

59
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.159
to cross by man and the mountains
too treacherous to climb.

60
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.712
And the seas either side
are too perilous that no

61
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.593
ship's captain will ever
dare to navigate them.

62
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.375
Well. we know Favian
is commanding the fury

63
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.756
and he seeks to wrest
the throne from father.

64
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.879
But how is he doing it'?

65
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.274
There is another. one who
is yet to reveal himself.

66
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.350
There must be.

67
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.639
Favian doesn’t have the knowledge
or power to do this on his own.

68
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.350
Or the courage

69
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.950
What is that'?

70
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.476
It came from the dragon
that destroyed the castle

71
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.875
Get some sleep, at first light
we push to the Northern Castle.

72
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.355
I'll take first watch.

73
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.190
Wan! some company George?

74
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.472
No, rest up old friend

75
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:11.121
George. Dimia.

76
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:21.560
Thank god we found ya

77
00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:28.514
You're the King's Knights

78
00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:30.835
You were at the Inn.

79
00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:33.165
Everyone we're safe

80
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:35.600
You have to save us

81
00:11:38.405 --> 00:11:39.395
What happened'?

82
00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:48.323
Kettlage was overrun by [he restless dead
These furies

83
00:11:48.845 --> 00:11:50.358
Killed so many of us.

84
00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:55.244
We lost our daughter. Please help us.

85
00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:56.795
Where are you headed?

86
00:11:58.325 --> 00:12:02.762
To the King's Western Castle if it
pleases you ma'am. We'll be safe there.

87
00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:05.238
The King's army will protect us.

88
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.115
What's wrong'?

89
00:12:17.845 --> 00:12:20.121
Please let us shelter within
the safety of the walls

90
00:12:20.685 --> 00:12:22.517
Please you have to protect us.

91
00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:27.236
- Please, sirs. Don't leave us to die.
- Please. please. have mercy.

92
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:29.203
- We are honorable people
- Enough.

93
00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.478
The castle has been destroyed.

94
00:12:37.565 --> 00:12:39.078
You'll find no refuge there.

95
00:12:40.165 --> 00:12:41.360
All this way for nothing.

96
00:12:42.485 --> 00:12:44.900
Lies. They don't want to help us.
Nothing can

97
00:12:44.925 --> 00:12:47.485
bring down the castle walls
not even these fury.

98
00:12:48.205 --> 00:12:50.082
What Sir George says is true

99
00:12:50.845 --> 00:12:54.122
The castle was overrun
and completely destroyed

100
00:12:54.485 --> 00:12:58.240
You must come with us to the North Castle,
that is the only way you will be safe.

101
00:12:58.845 --> 00:13:00.279
What could destroy the castle?

102
00:13:03.805 --> 00:13:04.795
Here

103
00:13:12.925 --> 00:13:15.917
It's come back for the egg.

104
00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.679
Then we give it what it wants

105
00:14:27.085 --> 00:14:29.554
I told you all that thing would
bring us nothing but trouble.

106
00:14:34.245 --> 00:14:35.235
Good riddance

107
00:14:36.685 --> 00:14:38.244
Until it comes back again.

108
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.594
They need lo wait here

109
00:15:10.405 --> 00:15:11.634
You need to see this

110
00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:15.399
Dimia, stay with the Princess.

111
00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:46.395
What's wrong'?

112
00:15:47.285 --> 00:15:50.801
Furies. as far as the eye can see and
they're heading straight towards us.

113
00:15:54.285 --> 00:15:55.275
What are we to do?

114
00:15:56.045 --> 00:15:58.605
We're gonna die. We're all gonna die.

115
00:15:59.525 --> 00:16:01.004
Ooh. we've lost everything.

116
00:16:02.685 --> 00:16:05.564
I knew we shouldn't have
gone this way, I told you!

117
00:16:06.325 --> 00:16:09.300
- Like we should have gone down to-
- I am the townsman and you do as I say.

118
00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:10.440
Stop fighting.

119
00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:18.120
Stop fighting.

120
00:16:20.845 --> 00:16:21.835
What are we gonna do?

121
00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:24.640
What are we going to do'?

122
00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:30.039
We're out off, there's no my through

123
00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:33.765
There must be thousands of them.

124
00:16:35.205 --> 00:16:37.276
This was the Prince's plan all along.
To surround

125
00:16:37.325 --> 00:16:39.396
us and finish off everyone
who's not loyal to him.

126
00:16:40.365 --> 00:16:43.960
How do we get to the Northern Castle?
We have to warn father.

127
00:16:44.485 --> 00:16:47.523
We need to protect the people of
our kingdom. of all the kingdoms.

128
00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:51.156
Favian wants us to bow at his
feet, we mustn’t let him win.

129
00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.364
Maybe we head back to Kalon

130
00:17:03.005 --> 00:17:04.075
D'you think we'll make it?

131
00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:06.642
Favian surely has the
Kingdom surrounded by now.

132
00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:09.754
I just have this sick feeling
that inside of me that we are

133
00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:12.234
not fighting with our Katori
sisters to the final toll

134
00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:16.557
As do I. But what shame do we have?

135
00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:23.878
These are unbearable odds George

136
00:17:25.605 --> 00:17:29.838
We can't go back north. Now we
can't go south. W-What now?

137
00:17:30.365 --> 00:17:33.357
East. To the coast and safety by the sea.

138
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:37.842
No means in which to buy passage.

139
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.796
Here. Take this

140
00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.060
Give this to the captain
of the Kings Armada.

141
00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:46.883
Tell him to set sail for the Red Islands.

142
00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:51.715
And to take you there to safety. Tell him
to remain there until he gets more orders.

143
00:17:52.045 --> 00:17:55.322
Just make sure that he takes the
whole Armada from the land.

144
00:17:57.765 --> 00:17:59.365
- You're not going to come with us?
- No!

145
00:17:59.925 --> 00:18:03.202
Our path leads into darkness.
You'll be safer on the seas.

146
00:18:05.405 --> 00:18:06.475
Let me come with you

147
00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:10.995
I can help.

148
00:18:11.845 --> 00:18:12.835
I can become a Knight

149
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:15.360
To become a Knight takes years
of dedication and training.

150
00:18:16.165 --> 00:18:17.200
We began at childhood.

151
00:18:18.645 --> 00:18:22.559
You're a townsman, your
responsibility is to these people.

152
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:28.115
- But you take Katori with you.
- I said no.

153
00:18:30.365 --> 00:18:32.959
It's. err. it's Bryce.
it's Bryce isn't it'?

154
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:37.520
Part of being a Knight is obeying orders even
if those orders are disagreeable to you.

155
00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:41.045
What is the best way to get to the castle?

156
00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:44.039
We go through The Dark Kingdom.

157
00:18:48.725 --> 00:18:50.921
The Dark Kingdom is an evil place.

158
00:18:51.405 --> 00:18:53.715
No-one of sane mind has
ventured into that land.

159
00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:55.199
H's the mos! direct mute

160
00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:59.041
The fury are closing in, we have no choice.

161
00:18:59.325 --> 00:19:02.124
But George... The Dark Kingdom...

162
00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:05.805
No-one has ever survived The Dark Kingdom.

163
00:19:18.285 --> 00:19:22.165
The air is thick with whispers,
talk of overthrowing the King

164
00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:25.875
Ssssh. the very bricks of this
castle listen for deceit.

165
00:19:26.245 --> 00:19:30.398
The bricks may Helen bu! so do
I, there are changes coming.

166
00:19:30.525 --> 00:19:34.041
You speak of treason. You want us killed'?

167
00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:27.045
Your Majesty, you wished
to hear the report.

168
00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:32.555
Your majesty?

169
00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:35.760
Forgive me Commander.

170
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:39.959
My mind is with my wife, the Queen

171
00:20:42.005 --> 00:20:43.916
I fear she gets weaker by the day

172
00:20:45.725 --> 00:20:46.760
You were saying}

173
00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:49.961
We have not had word
from the Western Castle.

174
00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:53.364
The messenger's um! we
sen! has not returned and

175
00:20:53.405 --> 00:20:55.874
we fear for the Prince
and Princess' safety.

176
00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:57.640
Their safely?

177
00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:01.123
But we sent a whole battalion there?

178
00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:05.202
What if George and his
men weren't successful?

179
00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.200
What if the dragon has
destroyed [he castle?

180
00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:12.800
What of my daughter'?

181
00:21:14.325 --> 00:21:15.838
What if... if...

182
00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:21.719
No need to worry Father.

183
00:21:22.525 --> 00:21:26.803
The Western Castle is safe and
secure as am I and sister.

184
00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:28.275
Favian.

185
00:21:29.165 --> 00:21:30.599
What are you doing here?

186
00:21:31.645 --> 00:21:34.398
wanted lo be close to you and mother

187
00:21:35.645 --> 00:21:37.044
Where is the battalion.

188
00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:40.900
I do not need any battalion
to hide behind Father.

189
00:21:40.925 --> 00:21:44.202
I would brave any danger
to be at Mothers side.

190
00:21:45.405 --> 00:21:49.160
The battalion remains with
the people at the castle.

191
00:21:50.205 --> 00:21:53.323
An old heart warms with
your gallantry my son.

192
00:21:56.805 --> 00:21:58.034
But Favian...

193
00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.276
Where is Elizabeth?

194
00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.641
Do you believe all the stories
of The Dark Kingdom?

195
00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:08.078
They're not just stories Your Highness.

196
00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:11.196
Those who have ventured
in have never returned.

197
00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:13.274
Only their screams.

198
00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:14.955
M's true

199
00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:18.001
The Katori know of many
souls lost to that place.

200
00:22:18.605 --> 00:22:20.357
What are these myths you tell of?

201
00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:25.756
Myths! Huh! The legend tells of a
sorcery by the name of the Magister.

202
00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:28.878
And he descended into the
deepest and darkest valley.

203
00:22:29.285 --> 00:22:35.042
Once he was there he used his powers to create
such abhorrent abominations of creatures

204
00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:39.155
The strange mist fell on the land
and for two hundred years the name

205
00:22:39.205 --> 00:22:42.561
'The Dark Kingdom' has struck fear
in the heart of the innocents.

206
00:22:43.765 --> 00:22:46.598
And yet. that is where we are headed.

207
00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:49.441
Bu! it can! be (me, can it?

208
00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:51.804
That is the stuff of nightmares.

209
00:22:52.965 --> 00:22:56.595
No-one knows, no-one living anyway

210
00:23:50.845 --> 00:23:52.438
Maul you to leach me how to fight

211
00:23:56.565 --> 00:23:59.318
if half the legends are true
I'll need to be of better use.

212
00:24:00.365 --> 00:24:01.355
As you wish.

213
00:24:04.245 --> 00:24:05.519
Richard, swords

214
00:24:13.725 --> 00:24:16.763
Take the sword. Hold it like this.

215
00:24:17.565 --> 00:24:19.954
It has to become part of
you, not something you hold.

216
00:24:20.005 --> 00:24:22.042
Let the weight move with
you. not against you.

217
00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:25.917
Now draw it into your
body and lean forward.

218
00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:31.199
Many attacker will charge you down.
With the blade

219
00:24:31.245 --> 00:24:33.555
in this position. it'll
surely find its mark.

220
00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:36.437
From here, you defend

221
00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:41.715
Good

222
00:24:42.925 --> 00:24:43.915
You ready?

223
00:24:47.325 --> 00:24:48.315
Good

224
00:24:49.045 --> 00:24:51.400
Use your body and footwork
to avoid the News.

225
00:24:53.645 --> 00:24:54.635
Show me

226
00:24:56.605 --> 00:24:57.595
Attack

227
00:25:00.605 --> 00:25:01.595
Try.

228
00:25:05.565 --> 00:25:06.555
Good

229
00:26:34.165 --> 00:26:35.564
Sirens!

230
00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:44.076
Fish. Fishy Puh. Tuh.. Sc good

231
00:27:46.845 --> 00:27:48.961
There's been something I've
been meaning to tell you.

232
00:27:49.365 --> 00:27:50.355
Goon

233
00:27:51.845 --> 00:27:53.677
The stable girl I talked of...

234
00:27:54.245 --> 00:27:56.316
Elizabeth and I we-

235
00:27:56.605 --> 00:27:57.800
I know.

236
00:27:59.125 --> 00:28:00.195
How long have you known'?

237
00:28:00.565 --> 00:28:03.034
I wasn't sure until we were
in the castle two nights ago.

238
00:28:04.005 --> 00:28:08.795
It wasn't supposed to happen. A Knight and
a Princess. that's why I kept it a secret.

239
00:28:09.045 --> 00:28:10.683
There'll be many that will disapprove.

240
00:28:11.365 --> 00:28:12.514
But not you my friend?

241
00:28:12.805 --> 00:28:17.800
No. But we have a treacherous road
ahead, you must have a clear head.

242
00:28:20.725 --> 00:28:22.716
You weren't asleep last night, were you'?

243
00:28:23.285 --> 00:28:24.639
No.

244
00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:28.675
Always protecting me. even from myself.

245
00:28:28.805 --> 00:28:31.240
Always Sir. Always.

246
00:28:58.125 --> 00:29:02.801
Do you think the King
suspects anything is amiss?

247
00:29:03.245 --> 00:29:04.724
It's possible My Lord.

248
00:29:05.005 --> 00:29:05.995
Possible?

249
00:29:06.525 --> 00:29:08.482
Instruct the Magister...

250
00:29:09.765 --> 00:29:12.120
To have our Furies ready

251
00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:15.598
To stand outside the castle gates

252
00:29:16.205 --> 00:29:22.395
We must ensure that my dear
sister and her beloved Knights...

253
00:29:23.125 --> 00:29:24.115
Are finished.

254
00:29:25.165 --> 00:29:29.238
There is still no sign of her,
nor of Sir George or Sir Richard.

255
00:29:29.845 --> 00:29:32.519
Wan! them found

256
00:29:33.725 --> 00:29:37.434
Tell the Magister to send
Furies that have known them.

257
00:29:38.565 --> 00:29:44.277
Anyone turned that knows how
these Knights think find

258
00:29:45.565 --> 00:29:48.159
And destroy them

259
00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:50.003
As you command My Lord

260
00:29:53.485 --> 00:29:54.475
What is it?

261
00:29:55.005 --> 00:29:59.203
Nothing. I hear no birds. No animals.

262
00:29:59.845 --> 00:30:00.960
No insects

263
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.115
We're here

264
00:30:04.205 --> 00:30:06.116
The threshold of The Dark Kingdom.

265
00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.882
A place of no! day nor night

266
00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:10.400
I don't like it.

267
00:30:12.045 --> 00:30:13.274
None of us do

268
00:30:14.925 --> 00:30:15.915
Whatta we do now?

269
00:30:18.885 --> 00:30:22.321
Prepare yourselves, once we cross the
boundary there'll be no turning back.

270
00:30:30.885 --> 00:30:32.034
Are you ready Knight?

271
00:30:33.205 --> 00:30:35.845
I could have died happy in
the arms of that Siren.

272
00:30:36.445 --> 00:30:37.799
We move quickly and quietly.

273
00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:40.443
We mustn't attract any attention.

274
00:31:20.005 --> 00:31:20.995
What is it?

275
00:31:23.245 --> 00:31:26.044
Large Heavy

276
00:31:27.005 --> 00:31:29.076
Tracks are maybe two or three hours old.

277
00:31:31.965 --> 00:31:33.035
H's a Demon

278
00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:39.118
Mailers not. The tracks lead in
the other direction. Let's go.

279
00:31:46.885 --> 00:31:49.001
The Kingdom is overrun with Fury

280
00:31:50.005 --> 00:31:52.315
Fury' those are just stones

281
00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:57.156
Ne. Ne, no, no they're real. They
killed my daughter. And my husband

282
00:31:58.685 --> 00:31:59.675
M's true

283
00:32:00.205 --> 00:32:03.197
Our Village and the Western
Castle have been destroyed.

284
00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:05.799
Where are the King's messengers?

285
00:32:06.005 --> 00:32:07.200
Likely killed.

286
00:32:08.645 --> 00:32:11.717
The Royal Knights, they
told me to give you this.

287
00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:14.700
Please.

288
00:32:14.725 --> 00:32:16.124
You must help us.

289
00:32:16.325 --> 00:32:19.955
They said to set sail for The Red Islands.

290
00:32:20.285 --> 00:32:21.275
Captain?

291
00:32:26.845 --> 00:32:28.119
Whose blood is this?

292
00:32:28.925 --> 00:32:30.245
My husband's.

293
00:32:31.685 --> 00:32:37.363
He's just... he was just an Inn Keeper
and he couldn't fight off these Fury.

294
00:32:38.205 --> 00:32:39.559
We has! everything

295
00:32:41.165 --> 00:32:43.884
We have our orders We make haste

296
00:32:44.645 --> 00:32:45.999
For The Red Islands

297
00:33:09.245 --> 00:33:10.235
What is it?

298
00:33:10.645 --> 00:33:11.635
We're being watched

299
00:33:11.725 --> 00:33:12.840
Take cover.

300
00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:50.157
Let': leave before that thing comes back

301
00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:54.445
What ms that?

302
00:33:55.045 --> 00:34:00.723
I do not know, nor do I care to know. Nor do
I wish to find out what it was afraid of.

303
00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.003
That's what we all should be afraid of.

304
00:34:03.765 --> 00:34:04.835
This is magic

305
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:07.604
Let's get out of this place.

306
00:34:21.925 --> 00:34:26.362
Search your rotten minds, seek
out your old commander George.

307
00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:31.839
Find him and the Princess wherever they
hide. Do not rest until they are dead.

308
00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:42.363
I can't believe Bryce left us.

309
00:34:42.525 --> 00:34:45.278
He's selfish, some townsman he is

310
00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.118
He has his own demons.

311
00:34:47.405 --> 00:34:50.363
I'll need you to come to the
Captain and tell us why we are

312
00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:53.158
headed for The Red Islands and
my we have you on board

313
00:35:02.485 --> 00:35:04.556
You must tell me about these Fury.

314
00:35:04.965 --> 00:35:08.083
- Look, we have run for our lives.
- The Knights told us to come to you.

315
00:35:08.365 --> 00:35:10.003
To protect the people of Xaldah.

316
00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:17.601
We're on the brink and only our actions
will ensure the future of our Kingdom.

317
00:36:19.925 --> 00:36:21.324
You wish to see me Father.

318
00:36:24.925 --> 00:36:27.565
It is customary to knock before you enter.

319
00:36:28.245 --> 00:36:31.636
Your messenger said it was
urgent so no time to waste

320
00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:37.044
I prefer to stand and take in the room.

321
00:36:39.205 --> 00:36:40.275
Sit.

322
00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:51.442
There is something you are not telling me.

323
00:36:58.605 --> 00:37:03.281
As far as I am aware, the castle is intact.

324
00:37:04.565 --> 00:37:08.479
And why would the castle not he intact?

325
00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:16.038
Magic. I can smell it.

326
00:37:24.445 --> 00:37:27.085
Ssssssh.

327
00:37:27.245 --> 00:37:28.235
You hear that?

328
00:37:30.125 --> 00:37:31.559
Sounds like a rock slide.

329
00:37:34.005 --> 00:37:35.234
We have lo push forward

330
00:38:23.525 --> 00:38:24.595
Keep moving

331
00:38:27.245 --> 00:38:28.918
We're going to get crushed.

332
00:38:41.805 --> 00:38:42.795
Form up

333
00:38:43.125 --> 00:38:45.165
What good are our weapons
going to be against that'?

334
00:38:45.325 --> 00:38:47.601
Stop it. You're just annoying it.

335
00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:48.675
Elizabeth. No.

336
00:38:49.125 --> 00:38:50.524
- He'll kill her.
- Wait.

337
00:38:52.445 --> 00:38:53.435
Wan

338
00:38:59.165 --> 00:39:04.365
You're treading on my home

339
00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:05.760
Forgive us.

340
00:39:07.165 --> 00:39:08.439
We did not know

341
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:15.275
Our land has been destroyed and we are
trying to find safety. We mean you no harm.

342
00:39:16.445 --> 00:39:19.039
Drop your weapons

343
00:39:44.085 --> 00:39:46.042
Careful

344
00:39:46.605 --> 00:39:50.758
This mean place.

345
00:39:52.565 --> 00:39:54.158
Thank you for your kindness

346
00:39:56.885 --> 00:40:00.594
Kind-ness.

347
00:40:29.045 --> 00:40:30.080
Well that was weird.

348
00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:32.460
We were all ready to fight
but all it took was a

349
00:40:32.485 --> 00:40:34.761
moment of softness from
the Princess to stop it.

350
00:40:35.765 --> 00:40:37.563
Elizabeth. please never do that again.

351
00:40:39.765 --> 00:40:42.564
It's alright George. You can trust me.

352
00:40:42.845 --> 00:40:45.155
The story was of rocks moving with intent

353
00:40:45.605 --> 00:40:47.403
The rocks were actually alive.

354
00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:51.124
Maybe we should be more mindful of
the interpretations of the legends.

355
00:40:51.765 --> 00:40:58.114
Yeah. Of course. Now. my friends.
please can we get out of this place.

356
00:41:50.205 --> 00:41:55.484
His time is over. It is time I became King.

357
00:41:55.685 --> 00:41:58.598
What is it you would have me do My Lord?

358
00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:02.919
Find a way to get the Furies
within the castle walls.

359
00:42:03.045 --> 00:42:08.518
Maul to lake this castle within two days

360
00:42:09.885 --> 00:42:11.319
As you with My Lord.

361
00:42:17.925 --> 00:42:21.520
And you, dear sister.

362
00:42:22.485 --> 00:42:26.240
Where in the four comers are you?

363
00:42:39.485 --> 00:42:40.520
Ssssh

364
00:42:47.525 --> 00:42:48.674
Did anybody see that?

365
00:42:49.685 --> 00:42:50.800
<i>We've gm company</i>

366
00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:53.284
We are being Matched

367
00:43:00.325 --> 00:43:01.645
I've seen at least two of them.

368
00:43:04.845 --> 00:43:06.165
How much further George?

369
00:43:08.805 --> 00:43:12.275
Maybe a day. Two. But the terrain's
going to have to start going

370
00:43:12.325 --> 00:43:15.397
up if we're ever going to make
it out of this dark realm.

371
00:43:22.205 --> 00:43:27.678
This place stinks, makes my skin itch.

372
00:43:43.965 --> 00:43:48.243
There

373
00:44:05.245 --> 00:44:06.235
Quickly.

374
00:45:20.445 --> 00:45:22.356
She's gone.

375
00:47:08.605 --> 00:47:10.118
Some kind of Carnivore.

376
00:48:58.165 --> 00:48:59.155
Katori

377
00:49:03.925 --> 00:49:05.199

378
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:34.995
<i>Take mam Lord Rem</i>

Face From

380
00:50:43.845 --> 00:50:45.677
A place never of day nor night

381
00:50:48.325 --> 00:50:50.635
A twilight of never-ending nightmares.

382
00:51:18.005 --> 00:51:19.234
Stop.

383
00:51:20.285 --> 00:51:21.275
Halt.

384
00:52:05.605 --> 00:52:08.165
Bring them to mm

385
00:53:41.405 --> 00:53:45.956
Bryce! Slayer of beasts.

386
00:53:50.445 --> 00:53:54.404
Bryce! Slayer of beasts!

387
00:54:00.245 --> 00:54:04.557
Katori. What are you doing here?

388
00:54:11.765 --> 00:54:13.722
It's not safe. Follow me.

389
00:54:51.005 --> 00:54:51.995
You did that?

390
00:54:52.885 --> 00:54:54.717
You managed to slay all those beasts?

391
00:54:56.045 --> 00:54:57.035
I did.

392
00:54:57.485 --> 00:54:58.634
Use caution with him.

393
00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.603
Mighty warrior you must be Bryce.

394
00:55:11.485 --> 00:55:12.998
To have slain all those creatures

395
00:55:15.165 --> 00:55:16.599
How do you know vino I am?

396
00:55:17.005 --> 00:55:18.962
You were singing you own praises by name.

397
00:55:32.925 --> 00:55:34.882
So many enemies slain

398
00:55:35.445 --> 00:55:36.560
Yet here you are

399
00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:39.562
Not so much as a scratch on you

400
00:55:41.085 --> 00:55:42.200
I am fast.

401
00:55:42.365 --> 00:55:43.480
No you're not

402
00:55:45.485 --> 00:55:47.123
I am a warrior.

403
00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:50.755
And I did kill all of those beasts.

404
00:55:52.525 --> 00:55:54.357
And you all should be cautious of me.

405
00:55:54.565 --> 00:55:55.714
Is that so'?

406
00:55:58.645 --> 00:56:00.795
What are you doing so far from home Bryce?

407
00:56:01.085 --> 00:56:02.564
I'm tracking a group of Knights.

408
00:56:03.125 --> 00:56:04.195
And Kalon

409
00:56:07.085 --> 00:56:08.200
I am have lo save them

410
00:56:09.925 --> 00:56:11.359
You're tracking Katori'?

411
00:56:11.765 --> 00:56:12.755
Liar'

412
00:56:14.325 --> 00:56:15.315
Who?

413
00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:17.642
And why would these Katori need your help?

414
00:56:18.645 --> 00:56:22.434
There is a dark army swarming the Kingdom.

415
00:56:24.245 --> 00:56:26.805
Sir George needs to know
if they are following him.

416
00:56:31.245 --> 00:56:34.363
These Katori. they are
the Knight's prisoners?

417
00:56:36.805 --> 00:56:39.923
No. They're working together.

418
00:56:40.245 --> 00:56:41.644
Dimia has betrayed us.

419
00:56:45.685 --> 00:56:48.245
A slayer such as yourself will be of use.

420
00:56:49.045 --> 00:56:54.119
Come Bryce. Let us find your
Knights and these Katori.

421
00:57:13.285 --> 00:57:18.564
Pm Reno. Lord of The Dark Kingdom
Who are you?

422
00:57:19.645 --> 00:57:22.717
What are you doing in my bud?

423
00:57:26.485 --> 00:57:27.714
We're just passing through

424
00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:31.403
So if you'll give us back our
weapons we'll be on our way.

425
00:57:31.645 --> 00:57:35.275
Be on your way?

426
00:57:35.645 --> 00:57:38.876
No outsider has ever entered my Kingdom

427
00:57:39.685 --> 00:57:42.723
No! You will stay as my guests.

428
00:57:43.445 --> 00:57:46.995
Your guests? Do you always
bind the hands of your guests?

429
00:57:48.685 --> 00:57:52.155
Who are you'? What are you doing here?

430
00:57:53.045 --> 00:57:55.434
We are just passing through

431
00:57:55.845 --> 00:57:58.405
No-one passes through here

432
00:58:01.125 --> 00:58:02.923
All other routes are closed to us.

433
00:58:03.285 --> 00:58:05.196
Bandits.

434
00:58:05.285 --> 00:58:08.243
Yes. You're on the run

435
00:58:09.005 --> 00:58:12.794
No mailer. To pass through here is death

436
00:58:13.125 --> 00:58:15.740
We did not know the laws
of your land and there

437
00:58:15.765 --> 00:58:18.075
were none to ask. Please
just lei us pass.

438
00:58:18.485 --> 00:58:23.605
You're too entertaining to let you leave.

439
00:58:24.005 --> 00:58:28.681
You've slain many of my people and
somehow lived to enter my chamber.

440
00:58:28.885 --> 00:58:32.674
And dare to tell me to let you pass.

441
00:58:33.085 --> 00:58:35.474
- I, I, we didn't mean.
- Silence!

442
00:58:36.405 --> 00:58:39.124
Strip them of their armor, take them away.

443
00:58:39.445 --> 00:58:42.915
I will decide what to do with them.

444
00:58:55.285 --> 00:58:56.275
A bite or a sling?

445
00:58:56.325 --> 00:58:57.315
Bite.

446
00:58:57.645 --> 00:58:58.635
What is that'?

447
00:58:58.965 --> 00:59:00.981
- Where's it coming from'?
- Sssssh. Listen.

448
00:59:02.885 --> 00:59:04.114
Follow me, let's go.

449
00:59:05.085 --> 00:59:06.155
HWY

450
00:59:06.485 --> 00:59:07.475
It's too late.

451
00:59:07.845 --> 00:59:08.835
No.

452
00:59:09.085 --> 00:59:10.075
<i>Run.</i>

453
01:00:03.005 --> 01:00:03.995
Halt

454
01:00:05.805 --> 01:00:07.716
Maul to hear what they have lo say

455
01:00:08.965 --> 01:00:13.163
Retic. it is I. your master.
These are my creations.

456
01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:17.842
Hear me now I have [racked two
Knights and a Princess here

457
01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.514
Do you have them?

458
01:00:20.045 --> 01:00:21.558
A Princess?

459
01:00:22.205 --> 01:00:23.525
Do you have them?

460
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:26.924
Possibly, what are they to you?

461
01:00:27.405 --> 01:00:29.157
Bring them before me

462
01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:30.955
No.

463
01:00:31.005 --> 01:00:32.962
You dare defy your master?

464
01:00:33.045 --> 01:00:35.321
Master? Master!

465
01:00:35.805 --> 01:00:39.958
You have no power here ever since you
abandoned us to serve your Prince

466
01:00:40.085 --> 01:00:42.804
I created you, you will obey me.

467
01:00:43.045 --> 01:00:45.321
MN not. None of us will

468
01:00:46.285 --> 01:00:48.356
I rule The Dark Kingdom now.

469
01:00:48.565 --> 01:00:52.115
I created you and I can destroy you.
Do not anger

470
01:00:52.165 --> 01:00:55.442
me or I will send my Fury
army to destroy you.

471
01:00:56.125 --> 01:00:59.516
You forget the army of
abominations that you

472
01:00:59.565 --> 01:01:02.762
left behind. They are
now mine to command.

473
01:01:03.605 --> 01:01:07.838
Retic. my son. I do not
want to invade your home.

474
01:01:08.205 --> 01:01:09.764
I know you have them

475
01:01:10.245 --> 01:01:12.077
Our desires are the same.

476
01:01:12.685 --> 01:01:15.484
You want the Princess
and these Knights dead'?

477
01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.795
<i>Mo,.</i>

478
01:01:17.485 --> 01:01:19.522
And she is the Princess
of the Light Kingdom

479
01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:21.637
The Princess of Xaldah.

480
01:01:22.165 --> 01:01:23.235
Very well

481
01:01:24.645 --> 01:01:27.922
They will die by my hand,
as and when I decide.

482
01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:31.238
But they will not leave
The Dark Kingdom alive.

483
01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.323
Then we have an agreement

484
01:01:33.925 --> 01:01:35.074
Fetch the prisoners.

485
01:01:36.045 --> 01:01:38.082
Take them to [he Arena

486
01:01:38.165 --> 01:01:40.918
Yes. Master

487
01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:46.764
No matter what happens, the
Princess leaves with us.

488
01:01:47.005 --> 01:01:47.995
As you command

489
01:01:48.365 --> 01:01:49.844
- With honor
- With honor

490
01:01:52.925 --> 01:01:54.598
Bring them out

491
01:02:05.045 --> 01:02:06.274
Silence.

492
01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:12.237
You have desecrated my
lands. killed my people.

493
01:02:13.485 --> 01:02:17.399
I offer you a choice, die where you stand.

494
01:02:19.165 --> 01:02:21.202
Or fight to [he death {or your freedom

495

Win and you will go free.

496
01:02:26.045 --> 01:02:27.035
All of us?

497
01:02:29.165 --> 01:02:33.557
No. The Princess remains.
She is to be mine.

498
01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:38.004
Never. We do not accept your terms.

499
01:02:38.685 --> 01:02:41.325
Then you will die where you stand.

500
01:02:42.405 --> 01:02:43.395
Stop.

501
01:02:47.445 --> 01:02:48.480
Elizabeth! No!

502
01:02:52.045 --> 01:02:53.877
This is my decision George.

503
01:02:55.805 --> 01:03:00.356
You beat thew champion and you
make sure you find Father.

504

01:10:14.565 --> 01:10:15.765
He's never going to let us go.

539
01:11:01.685 --> 01:11:02.675
Lock out'

540
01:11:05.685 --> 01:11:08.484
Fool. I'm not a man of my word.

541
01:11:08.845 --> 01:11:10.244
You're not a man at all.

542
01:11:57.165 --> 01:11:59.805
I am the Lord of The Dark Kingdom

543
01:12:01.725 --> 01:12:02.715
Come on George

544
01:12:32.325 --> 01:12:34.316
Come on George, gel up, get up

545
01:12:34.845 --> 01:12:37.724
I am the Lord of The Dark Kingdom.

546
01:12:42.565 --> 01:12:45.205
He's not going to last much longer.
We need to be ready.

547
01:12:47.365 --> 01:12:48.355
Down

548
01:13:08.325 --> 01:13:09.315
Elizabeth!

549
01:13:10.525 --> 01:13:13.324
If George doesn't make it we've
got to get the Princess out.

550
01:13:21.485 --> 01:13:24.364
- She gave you orders
- So did George.

551
01:13:24.925 --> 01:13:27.041
You really though! you'd 'MN your freedom?

552
01:13:29.685 --> 01:13:36.000
I'm the master of this place and
I decide who lives and who dies.

553
01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:37.635
Not any more

554
01:13:50.165 --> 01:13:52.315
Don't make me kill you. Do you yield?

555
01:13:54.325 --> 01:13:55.440
<i>Mien.</i>

556
01:13:56.285 --> 01:14:00.916
Then I accept your surrender, we are all
to leave here unharmed. Do you agree?

557
01:14:03.245 --> 01:14:05.634
- I agree.
- Louder so all can hear you.

558
01:14:07.445 --> 01:14:10.995
I agree to allow you and your
companions leave here untanned.

559
01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:14.559
Bring the Princess down here.

560
01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:23.603
- George.
- Well fought Knight. Well fought indeed.

561
01:14:24.045 --> 01:14:26.321
- I thought you were done for
- Never out of a fight

562
01:14:26.605 --> 01:14:29.438
Never. Let's get out of
this godforsaken place.

563
01:14:47.685 --> 01:14:48.720
Katori!

564
01:14:54.885 --> 01:14:56.319
Kill them all!

565
01:15:10.605 --> 01:15:13.420
We've searched for you
on your unsanctioned

566
01:15:13.445 --> 01:15:16.244
quest. You've betrayed
us for these Knights.

567
01:15:17.005 --> 01:15:18.154
Now you must die

568
01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.524
You will never be Queen

569
01:15:55.125 --> 01:16:00.279
I do not betray Katori. These
Knights saved our lives.

570
01:16:00.805 --> 01:16:03.035
Fight me. Or fight with us.

571
01:16:53.605 --> 01:16:56.279
No more'

572
01:16:57.645 --> 01:17:01.240
No more'

573
01:17:02.165 --> 01:17:06.762
No more!

574
01:17:08.685 --> 01:17:09.675
<i>Have “mercy.</i>

575
01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:15.843
Retic. We began the day as enemies.

576
01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:20.356
The only way we will win
the war is as allies.

577
01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:29.922
We all have one common enemy. We
will only defeat him together.

578
01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:35.083
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

579
01:17:41.685 --> 01:17:44.438
How long before the Fury
surround the castle?

580
01:17:45.445 --> 01:17:46.924
A day my Lord

581
01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:52.076
Well tell him to hurry up Goddammit, people
will notice the King is missing soon.

582
01:17:52.485 --> 01:17:53.634
As you wish.

583
01:17:55.485 --> 01:17:57.715
How many Dragonlings have now hatched?

584
01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:01.765
Maul him to make them subservient lo me

585
01:18:03.805 --> 01:18:09.835
I want all the Dragonlings under
my command and under my rule.

586
01:18:14.005 --> 01:18:18.283
Very well. I accept your
offer of an alliance.

587
01:18:22.405 --> 01:18:23.918
George' what about the Fury?

588
01:18:24.885 --> 01:18:29.118
They say if you slay the sorcery that casts
the spell. the spell is then lifted.

589
01:18:30.285 --> 01:18:31.275
Let us hope.

590
01:18:36.085 --> 01:18:43.003
Failure and disobedience is unacceptable.
You are weak and inferior creatures.

591
01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:50.637
I shall command my Fury army to eradicate
you. the Princess, the Kinghts. Katori...

592
01:18:50.965 --> 01:18:54.180
Every living thing in
The Dark Kingdom. Your

593
01:18:54.205 --> 01:18:57.243
existence no bugs! has
any meaning to me.

594
01:19:02.565 --> 01:19:07.514
Have no fear. These outsiders
see us for what we are.

595
01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:12.404
We are all warriors. We
have a common enemy.

596
01:19:13.325 --> 01:19:18.877
Our creator wishes to destroy our Kingdom
and he wishes to destroy their Kingdom.

597
01:19:19.485 --> 01:19:21.795
Together we strong.

598
01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:29.237
Together we can stop him. Assemble
the army. For tomorrow...

599
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.244
We go lo war

600
01:19:39.725 --> 01:19:42.001
What have you done Favian'?

601
01:19:45.365 --> 01:19:49.518
The Northern Castle will soon be mine.

602
01:19:52.365 --> 01:19:54.720
What manner of creatures are they'?

603
01:20:05.685 --> 01:20:10.441
They are my creatures
They are Furies Father

604
01:20:11.045 --> 01:20:17.200
They are what have been stopping
messengers, killing troops...

605
01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:23.599
And they are what will
gain me your Kingdom.

606
01:20:25.645 --> 01:20:26.760
But why?

607
01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:29.645
Why do this?

608
01:20:31.605 --> 01:20:35.314
Does your thirst for power mean
you will turn my Subjects...

609
01:20:35.405 --> 01:20:41.924
They are not your Subjects anymore

610
01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:45.957
They will either accept me as their ruler.

611
01:20:46.565 --> 01:20:52.277
Or be destroyed by my army.

612
01:20:57.365 --> 01:20:58.639
Your army?

613
01:21:00.325 --> 01:21:03.740
No Favian'? No. What have you done'?

614
01:21:03.765 --> 01:21:05.915
No Favian'? No. What have you done'?

615
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:09.244
Where is your sister, where is she'?

616
01:21:09.605 --> 01:21:15.795
And you Father, will remain...

617
01:21:19.125 --> 01:21:20.115
Here
