How would we even get there?

297

- Walk.
- [Paul] We walk?

299

That's what you dug me
out of the rubble for?

300
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.177
I can't walk. I don't even have a suit.

301
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:03.637
Listen. Listen to me.

302
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.847
Here's what we're gonna do.

303
00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:10.269
We're gonna drop down
to the cargo elevator to the seafloor.

304
00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:13.522
Then we use the access tunnel
to get to the Midpoint station.

305
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:16.984
There we can charge
and clean the rebreathers.

306
00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:21.863
And then we follow the markers
across the plateau to the Roebuck.

[rumbling]

308
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:28.078

we might die doing that?

Also, the temperature outside
jumped ten degrees.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:39.851
It's actually
a normal neurological reaction.

519
00:33:40.643 --> 00:33:43.396
- When you're facing death, time...
- Listen to me.

520
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.941
You're not gonna die. Okay?

521
00:33:50.278 --> 00:33:51.237
[Paul] <i>All right.</i>

522
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.531
<i>Worst idea ever.</i>

523
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.283
<i>Let's do it anyway.</i>

524
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:58.244
[Smith] <i>Helmets on. Locked and loaded.</i>

525
00:33:58.327 --> 00:33:59.412
Either of you have dogs?

526
00:33:59.495 --> 00:34:00.455
[Paul] <i>Flood it, Norah!</i>

527
00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.831
- Flooding.
- [beeps]

528
00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:04.292
- [machinery whirring]
- [beeping]

529
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.543
I have a corgi.

530
00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:11.257
Not house-trained, so he's
kind of a nightmare right now,

531
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.760
but I didn't think
I would miss him this much.

532
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:16.471
[Smith] <i>Okay, hatch is sealed.
We're outside.</i>

533
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:20.058
[Captain] I'll put us on standby.

534
00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:22.560
Turn the floodlights on, please.

535
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:26.439
- [trilling]
- [beeping]

536
00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:30.693
[metallic creaking]

537
00:34:33.154 --> 00:34:35.656
[Smith] <i>Cap,
this platform's not too stable.</i>

538
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.493
<i>I, uh, don't know how long
we should be out here.</i>

539
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:52.548
<i>Oh, God.</i>

540
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.932
Guys, keep on walking forward.
Like 20 meters.

541
00:35:01.015 --> 00:35:02.558
<i>Check what's on the right.</i>

542
00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:08.981
[Paul] <i>I can't see shit.
My right or his right?</i>

543
00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:10.399
[Smith shushing]

544
00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:15.446
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

545
00:35:19.742 --> 00:35:22.995
<i>Am I cracking up or is there, like,
like, a bird chirping right now?</i>

546
00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:26.374
[Captain] <i>We're not hearing
anything up here.</i>

547
00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:32.338
[Smith] <i>All right, Captain, talk to us.</i>

548
00:35:32.421 --> 00:35:34.549
<i>We close? We can't see anything out here.</i>

549
00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.968
Honestly, you should be
right in front of it.

550
00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:39.053
[Smith] <i>Okay.</i>

551
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.559
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

552
00:35:47.353 --> 00:35:48.855
[beeping]

553
00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:53.359
<i>Oh, hold up.</i>

554
00:35:54.485 --> 00:35:55.653
<i>You see that?</i>

555
00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:58.406
<i>Holy shit.</i>

556
00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:01.033
<i>What the hell happened to this thing?</i>

557
00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:07.748
<i>Looks like it imploded.
There's, uh, something.</i>

558
00:36:10.209 --> 00:36:11.460
<i>Something all over it.</i>

559
00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:13.462
<i>You seeing this?</i>

560
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:18.467
- [Norah] What is that?
- I'd need to take a closer look.

561
00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:20.469
It could be some sort of an algae.

562
00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:22.513
[Smith] <i>You ever see anything like that?</i>

563
00:36:23.764 --> 00:36:25.308
[Paul] <i>This looks...</i>

564
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:26.934
<i>It doesn't look like algae.</i>

565
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:29.854
Is there anybody in it?

566
00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.355
[Smith] <i>Empty.</i>

567
00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.608
[Paul] <i>I got something.</i>

568
00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.527
<i>Wallet.</i>

569
00:36:39.197 --> 00:36:41.115
<i>Great. We can use his credit cards.</i>

570
00:36:45.161 --> 00:36:46.412
<i>Captain, there's no body,</i>

571
00:36:46.495 --> 00:36:49.832
<i>so can we please and thank you
get the hell out of here before we...</i>

572
00:36:52.251 --> 00:36:54.170
<i>Scratch that. There's a body.
It's entangled...</i>

573
00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:55.421
They should just come back.

574
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:56.714
[Paul] <i>...in the coils.</i>

575
00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:05.765
Don't check it out. Just come back.

576
00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:08.768
- [Emily] Just come back.
- [Paul] <i>Wait. Do you see his back?</i>

577
00:37:13.606 --> 00:37:15.775
<i>- Can you see that?</i>
- Let's just bring them back.

578
00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:18.736
[Captain] Okay, come back. Paul.

579
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.405
[Paul] <i>Whoa. Smith.</i>

580
00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:24.116
Paul.

581
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.039
[Paul] <i>The hell's going on with his body?</i>

582
00:37:32.291 --> 00:37:36.337
<i>Did the pressure... liquefy...</i>

583
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.964
[screaming]

584
00:37:38.965 --> 00:37:40.424
[Smith] <i>Paul, hold still! God!</i>

585
00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.220
[Smith groans]

586
00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:47.223
[Smith] What is that thing?

587
00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.600
[Paul] All I know is that
it was eating a dead body

588
00:37:49.684 --> 00:37:51.352
and then it came at me.

589
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:56.899
[Smith] Em, what are you doing?

590
00:37:56.983 --> 00:37:58.901
- Uh, I'm just looking for its...
- [squeals]

591
00:37:58.985 --> 00:38:00.611
- [screaming]
- [Paul] Oh, no, no!

592
00:38:00.695 --> 00:38:02.154
- See?
- [Smith groans]

593
00:38:02.238 --> 00:38:03.572
[Emily] Looking for its mouth.

594
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.744
Is it still alive?

595
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.288
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause I will kill it.

596
00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:12.456
I think I just touched a nerve.

597
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.875
[Captain] Norah, how much
further do we have?

598
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.044
[Norah] 200 meters
away from the bottom.

599
00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.129
[rumbling]

600
00:38:18.212 --> 00:38:19.422
[Emily] Doesn't have any eyes.

601
00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:21.590
[Paul] How are they attracted
to the light?

602
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:22.925
Oh, my God, look at this.

603
00:38:23.009 --> 00:38:24.593
[Smith] Maybe they're like moths.

604
00:38:24.677 --> 00:38:26.262
[Paul] Underwater moths.

605
00:38:26.804 --> 00:38:28.055
[Emily] It's like talons.

606
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:30.391
I think this might be a new species.

607
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:31.934
Do we get to name it?

608
00:38:32.393 --> 00:38:33.769
I shot it. I'm naming it.

609
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.438
[rumbling]

610
00:38:36.397 --> 00:38:38.983
I've never seen
sea life like this down here.

611
00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:46.949
Unless... Unless we bored
into a hydrothermal pocket.

612
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.952
If it was sustained heat
that could support life...

613
00:38:50.953 --> 00:38:52.246
[Paul] Are you serious?

614
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.582
[Captain] Everybody stay calm. Stay calm.

615
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:57.168
- [Norah] My God.
- [Captain] Norah, what'd you get?

616
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:59.920
[Norah] Nothing. It's not just the lights.
The whole system's down.

617
00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.464
[Smith] Can you put us in neutral?

618
00:39:01.547 --> 00:39:03.299
- Glide the rest of the way?
- [Norah] Yeah.

619
00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:10.681
- [Smith] We have access to the cable?
- If we can disengage, definitely.

620
00:39:11.265 --> 00:39:12.850
[low growling]

621
00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:14.935
[thudding]

622
00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:16.103
[Captain] What was that?

623
00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:26.655
[rattling]

624
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.748
- [thuds]
- [Emily screams]

625
00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.501
This better not be some

626
00:39:38.584 --> 00:39:40.878
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea</i> shit, man.

627
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.256
[low thudding]

628
00:39:58.729 --> 00:39:59.563
[yells]

629
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:01.273
- [Captain] Paul.
- [Emily] What the hell?

630
00:40:01.357 --> 00:40:03.859
[Paul] Joking. But it sounds like
something's out there.

631
00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:07.655
[creature squishes]

632
00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:13.285
[Paul] It's probably not a good time
to ask, but is that a baby?

633
00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.664
- [thudding]
- [Emily gasps]

634
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:28.092
- Should we close that door?
- [door rattles]

635
00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:36.392
I'm gonna close it.
I'm gonna close that door.

636
00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:43.357
[door squeaks]

637
00:40:57.079 --> 00:40:58.080
Okay.

638
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:02.168
We gotta find a way to get down.

639
00:41:02.668 --> 00:41:05.379
We're completely disengaged.
I don't know why we're not moving.

640
00:41:05.463 --> 00:41:06.464
[thuds]

641
00:41:11.385 --> 00:41:12.386
[thuds]

642
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.019
[Emily] Oh, my God!

643
00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:21.854
[Paul] What the hell was that?

644
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:27.026
- [Smith] My God! The Kepler!
- [Captain] The Kepler exploded!

645
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:28.527
[Paul] Oh, shit, shit, shit!

646
00:41:30.863 --> 00:41:31.947
- [gasps]
- [Smith] Captain!

647
00:41:33.365 --> 00:41:35.701
- [Captain] Into the pressure chamber!
- [Paul] Oh, God!

648
00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:42.458
[Captain] We have to open the outside
hatch before we hit the seafloor!

649
00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:44.418
Or we get crushed! Move!

650
00:41:47.963 --> 00:41:49.798
Flood it! Flood it!

651
00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:51.717
[indistinct yelling]

652
00:41:54.136 --> 00:41:56.388
[Captain] Helmet, now!
Here we go! Come on!

653
00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:58.724
- [Smith over radio] <i>Help!</i>
- [Paul over radio] <i>Hang on!</i>

654
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:02.144
- [Captain] <i>Open the hatch!</i>
- [Paul] <i>All right.</i>

655
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.697
[Captain] <i>Run! Run! Run!</i>

656
00:42:18.827 --> 00:42:20.246
[Norah] <i>Watch it!</i>

657
00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:22.706
[groans]

658
00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:25.668
[Smith] <i>Norah.</i>

659
00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:31.757
[Paul] <i>Hey, guys! I'm over here.</i>

660
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.093
<i>Come to the green light.
I'm at the entrance.</i>

661
00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:36.720
[Norah] <i>Watch out, Smith!</i>

662
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:38.264
[Smith] <i>Emily, watch out!</i> [groans]

663
00:42:40.182 --> 00:42:43.394
<i>- Keep your eyes closed. Keep 'em closed.</i>
- [Emily] <i>I don't know what happened.</i>

664
00:42:45.854 --> 00:42:46.981
[Norah] <i>Come on, take him.</i>

665
00:42:47.106 --> 00:42:48.857
[Captain] <i>To the pipeline entrance!</i>

666
00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:49.942
<i>Come on.</i>

667
00:42:51.026 --> 00:42:54.029
[screeching]

668
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:58.367
[Paul] <i>I can't get the goddamn door open!</i>

669
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:00.661
<i>Smith, can you hear me?</i>

670
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:03.414
<i>It's gonna be okay, buddy.
You're gonna be okay.</i>

671
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:07.918
- [chittering]
- [roaring]

672
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:16.802
[beeps]

673
00:43:18.053 --> 00:43:19.179
[buzzes]

674
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.015
[Paul] Come on.

675
00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:23.100
Let's get him clear of the door!

676
00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.393
[Emily] Get him up.

677
00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:25.894
[Smith coughs]

678
00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:26.937
[gasping]

679
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:28.606
[Norah] Get him up. Get him up.

680
00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:31.442
- [coughs]
- [Emily] What happened? Are you okay?

681
00:43:32.234 --> 00:43:35.571
He inhaled some fumes. He's okay.
His oxygen scrubber took a hit.

682
00:43:35.654 --> 00:43:37.906
[Paul] We all saw this?
There are things out there.

683
00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:39.950
Fuck our lives!

684
00:43:44.204 --> 00:43:45.414
[thudding]

685
00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:51.712
- There's something out there.
- Oh, my God.

686
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:54.548
[Captain] Paul, stop.
It's just debris falling.

687
00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.800
Norah, call the mover.

688
00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.469
All right.

689
00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:03.432
Look at me. How's your sight?

690
00:44:04.308 --> 00:44:06.477
I'm good. [exhales]

691
00:44:08.854 --> 00:44:10.439
- It's gonna be all right.
- [Smith] Okay.

692
00:44:10.522 --> 00:44:12.608
I don't have the code.
I-I can't get in here.

693
00:44:18.614 --> 00:44:19.615
Ears.

694
00:44:20.532 --> 00:44:21.533
Eh, forget it.

695
00:44:23.994 --> 00:44:25.412
[thudding]

696
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.041
- [Smith] Give me your hand.
- Two, three!

697
00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:30.459
- [buzzing]
- [grunting]

698
00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:44.098
It's gonna be fine, buddy. Yeah.

699
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.767
[Captain] All right. We ride this
to the Midpoint Station.

700
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:52.773
{\an8}We're halfway there, guys.

701
00:44:53.732 --> 00:44:54.733
Halfway there.

702
00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:28.892
[Captain] Paul, stop the cart.
It's not gonna go in that kind of water.

703
00:45:28.976 --> 00:45:30.060
Stop it.

704
00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:32.104
[brakes squeal]

705
00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:38.152
- [Paul] That's a lot of water.
- [Norah] The pumps are probably jammed.

706
00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.945
What happens if they don't turn back on?

707
00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:42.865
Anybody else wanna take that?

708
00:45:42.948 --> 00:45:44.199
No?

709
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:48.120
In the book, Alice cried so much
she almost drowned in her own tears.

710
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.372
Luckily, she could swim.

711
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.666
It got pretty rough for her after that.

712
00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:53.917
[rumbling]

713
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:55.752
[low growling]

714
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:57.129
[thudding]

715
00:45:57.212 --> 00:45:59.590
[Smith] There's definitely
something following us.

716
00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:05.971
Okay. I'm getting very close
to shitting myself.

717
00:46:24.198 --> 00:46:26.617
[Paul] Looks like
somebody got a care package.

718
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.285
Cheetos and...

719
00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:30.496
Oh, the irony.

720
00:46:31.246 --> 00:46:32.664
[heavy breathing]

721
00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:35.459
[Emily] I love MoonPies.

722
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:42.299
This is someone's stuff.

723
00:46:47.095 --> 00:46:48.305
This is all someone's...

724
00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:49.389
Oh...

725
00:46:51.099 --> 00:46:52.100
Oh...

726
00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:53.185
Oh, my God.

727
00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:07.824
[thudding]

728
00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:14.122
Keep moving. Keep moving.

729
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:16.458
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:47:17.543 --> 00:47:19.711
[Captain] Come on, guys,
we're almost there.

731
00:47:19.795 --> 00:47:21.171
It should be 300 meters ahead.

732
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.188
[Emily] Is this it?

733
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:41.275
- [Paul] We can't go back.
- What does that mean?

734
00:47:42.234 --> 00:47:43.235
It's too tight.

735
00:47:44.194 --> 00:47:45.571
[Smith] Oh, no.

736
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:47.406
[Captain] We've got to find another way.

737
00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.949
I'm the smallest. Let me check.

738
00:47:49.908 --> 00:47:51.034
Here.

739
00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:53.287
Okay.

740
00:47:53.912 --> 00:47:55.289
Let me connect you with my line.

741
00:47:56.415 --> 00:47:57.499
Attached.

742
00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.462
Thank you.

743
00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:16.310
[heavy breathing]

744
00:48:31.491 --> 00:48:34.119
All right, I'm through.
It's open out here.

745
00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:36.705
I think you can definitely make it.
It's really tight but...

746
00:48:36.788 --> 00:48:38.415
- [Captain over radio] <i>Okay.</i>
- Huh?

747
00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:40.167
- [Captain] <i>We're sending Emily.</i>
- Okay.

748
00:48:41.126 --> 00:48:42.127
Attached.

749
00:48:54.014 --> 00:48:56.058
- [Smith] <i>Captain's on his way.</i>
- [Norah] Come here.

750
00:48:56.808 --> 00:48:57.934
[groans]

751
00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:59.728
Nice.

752
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:07.944
Hey.

753
00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:09.446
How you holding up?

754
00:49:09.529 --> 00:49:10.489
I'm okay.

755
00:49:11.865 --> 00:49:13.784
Um, I was gonna eat this,

756
00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:17.496
but Lil Paul and I decided
that you should give it to your girl.

757
00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.790
- MoonPie.
- Yeah.

758
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.875
MoonPie.

759
00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.629
- Thanks, man.
- She's pretty cool.

760
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.757
Gotta make sure not to screw that up.

761
00:49:30.842 --> 00:49:31.718
Yeah.

762
00:49:38.558 --> 00:49:39.476
Smith.

763
00:49:40.018 --> 00:49:41.019
<i>Your turn. Come on.</i>

764
00:49:41.103 --> 00:49:43.146
All right, Cap's through. I'm going.

765
00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.777
<i>All right, guys. I'm coming through.</i>

766
00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:57.661
- How are you doing in there?
- [distant bang]

767
00:49:57.744 --> 00:49:59.121
You want your bunny heater?

768
00:50:00.455 --> 00:50:01.456
[metallic clanging]

769
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:10.298
All right, forget this. We're going in.

770
00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:14.177
[Norah] Hey. You okay?

771
00:50:14.261 --> 00:50:16.179
- [Smith] Paul, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

772
00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:17.556
- You okay?
- Yeah.

773
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.141
[Paul yells]

774
00:50:19.224 --> 00:50:21.101
- [Paul over radio] <i>What is that?</i>
- Huh?

775
00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.853
[Smith] Paul? Paul, are you reading?

776
00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:24.563
Don't screw around. Let's go.

777
00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:25.897
[Smith] Hey, Paul, you copy?

778
00:50:26.022 --> 00:50:27.649
[Captain] We're gonna pull you through.

779
00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:29.484
- All right, pull.
- [Norah] All right.

780
00:50:29.568 --> 00:50:30.569
Here we go.

781
00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:42.205
- [Norah] Come on.
- I'm pulling. I'm pulling.

782
00:50:43.165 --> 00:50:44.207
Come on.

783
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:45.208
[Smith] Shit!

784
00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:47.919
[Emily] Come on, come on.

785
00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:55.135
- There he is.
- [Norah] You scared the shit out of me.

786
00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:58.472
There's something back there.
Some Slender Man-type shit.

787
00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:01.057
- Hey, that's not funny.
- [indistinct chatter]

788
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:02.809
What's wrong with my line?

789
00:51:06.438 --> 00:51:07.522
Unclip. He's all tangled.

790
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:08.565
- I got it.
- Oh, no!

791
00:51:10.942 --> 00:51:12.068
Unclip, unclip, unclip!

792
00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.321
[Paul] Take Lil Paul!

793
00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:16.865
Give me my helmet!
It's pulling me underwater!

794
00:51:16.948 --> 00:51:18.158
[Smith] He's going! Helmet!

795
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:19.326
- My helmet!
- [Smith] Now!

796
00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:20.494
Get it on! Get it on!

797
00:51:21.703 --> 00:51:22.996
Grab him! Grab him!

798
00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:32.088
Grab him! Grab him!

799
00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.261
[Smith] I can't hold him!

800
00:51:42.474 --> 00:51:43.850
- [screaming]
- [Norah] My God!

801
00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.185
[indistinct yelling]

802
00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.603
[Smith] Oh, my God!

803
00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.104
Paul!

804
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:49.815
[indistinct clamoring]

805
00:51:52.526 --> 00:51:53.777
[Captain] Get out of the water!

806
00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:55.987
- [Norah] Emily, go!
- [Captain] Get to the bulkhead!

807
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:15.215
{\an8}[over radio] <i>Calling CQ. Calling CQ.

{\an8}<i>We're at the Midway Station.
It's heavily damaged.</i>

809
00:52:21.096 --> 00:52:22.764
Not sure how long it will last.

810
00:52:25.058 --> 00:52:26.309
Does anyone copy?

811
00:52:28.353 --> 00:52:30.272
[Smith] It ripped him out of the suit.

812
00:52:31.356 --> 00:52:33.483
It ripped him right out
of his goddamn suit.

813
00:52:35.068 --> 00:52:36.152
What could do that?

814
00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:39.072

What is happening?

818
00:52:51.793 --> 00:52:53.837
[Smith] That drill weighs 6,000 tons.

819
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:57.591
How did it get ripped up like that?

820
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:01.219
[Emily] We did this.

821
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.099
We drilled the bottom of the ocean.

822
00:53:07.601 --> 00:53:09.019
We took too much.

823
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.230
And now she's taking back.

824
00:53:17.402 --> 00:53:19.362
We're not supposed to be down here.

825
00:53:22.115 --> 00:53:23.116
No one is.

826
00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:27.203
She's not wrong.

827
00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:41.009
Listen.

828
00:53:41.968 --> 00:53:43.511
I know Paul's gone, but...

829
00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:47.015
we can't stay here.

830
00:53:47.974 --> 00:53:49.351
What about Smith's suit?

831
00:53:50.602 --> 00:53:52.562
Let me take a look
at your oxygen scrubber.

832
00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:54.773
- [Smith] Hmm.
- [Captain] Come on.

833
00:53:58.652 --> 00:53:59.986
[Smith coughs]

834
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.741
How is it?

835
00:54:09.162 --> 00:54:10.372
The suit's not gonna make it.

836
00:54:17.796 --> 00:54:20.090
[whispering] You guys gotta go
without me. We... I'm...

837
00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:22.759
I'm just gonna be dead weight out there.

838
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.848
- I can't lose anybody else.
- Me neither.

839
00:54:30.225 --> 00:54:31.226
Stop.

840
00:54:37.565 --> 00:54:40.235
[Captain over radio] <i>Okay, Smith,
you can lean on me.</i>

841
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.488
<i>Take short, shallow breaths.</i>

842
00:54:44.322 --> 00:54:46.741
<i>- Okay.
- It's gonna be all right. I got you.</i>

843
00:55:12.058 --> 00:55:13.393

- [Emily] <i>My God!</i>

[Captain] <i>I saw that.</i>

851
00:56:27.383 --> 00:56:28.843
<i>- Set him down.
- What was that?</i>

853
00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:33.723

854
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:40.647

858
00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:58.414
Yeah.
