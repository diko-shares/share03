WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:23.042
Do you think they bought it?

2
00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:25.042
Of course they bought it!

3
00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:29.042
Well, Mama sounded suspicious and I
can hear my heart beating so loudly that I

4
00:00:29.042 --> 00:00:30.042
think other people can hear it, but...

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Oh, suit.

6
00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:35.084
I'm going to choose to believe your
heart's beating for me and take it as a

7
00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:36.042
compliment.

8
00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:44.042
So, how much secret science
time do we have today?

9
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.042
A few hours. FAL is busy
on their own missions,

10
00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.000
so nobody should notice if I hijack
their servers for a little private world

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.084
building.
Collaboration in action!

12
00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:54.000
That's what the Gizmo Cloud is all about!

13
00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:55.542
Meh.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I planned alternatives.

15
00:00:57.042 --> 00:01:00.084
The Gizmo Void, Gizmo Space, Gizmo-topia!

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.042
Yeah, it wasn't the cloud
part I had a problem with.

17
00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh, man!

18
00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:08.000
Another glitch!

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.042
You know, Dr. Gearloose could
help us get rid of these bugs.

20
00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.084
No, no, we can't tell
anyone about this place!

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.042
Uh, not yet.

22
00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.000
But we made this place
to share with the world!

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.042
Shouldn't we start sharing?

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
How many times have you shared an amazing
invention with someone only to have them

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.042
call you a dangerous crackpot?

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.500
Today?

27
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.042
Everything has to be perfect
before we share this place.

28
00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:33.042
Any place where we're together
already is perfect.

29
00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:35.000
Mmm, gross.

30
00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:41.084
-This is going to be-
-I'm Meilin Lee, and ever since I turned 13,

31
00:01:41.084 --> 00:01:47.000
I've been doing my own thing,
making my own moves, 24-7, 365!

32
00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:52.000
I wear what I want, say what I want,
and I will not hesitate to do a spontaneous

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.042
cartwheel if I feel so moved!

34
00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:53.542
Oh, crap!

35
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Not to brag, but being 13 means
I'm officially a grown-up!

36
00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:04.084
At least according to the
Toronto Transit Commission.

37
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.042
Good for you.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

38
00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:12.000
All about that hair song, am I right?

39
00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.829
HOPE

40
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:51.084
Big day, big day, big
day, big day, big day!

41
00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.042
Yes! Rise Good morning Flint
Rockwood and lab partner Ivar.

42
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Hello.
Hey, monkey, excuse me.

43
00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:01.042
I'm an ape.

44
00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:07.000
What a place to be
for good innovation.

45
00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:08.042
brain within my ape's brain.

46
00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:18.042
Look at your ducking. I'll be your
welcome back. Are you ready to live?

47
00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:27.042
Oh, am I? Fight for you and me.

48
00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:34.042
Monkey. Ate.
Follow me boys. Welcome to Libcorp.

49
00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:41.084
There are caffeine stations
every ten feet.

50
00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:42.042
Soy free soy latte. Thanks.

51
00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:47.042
Hot.
Not too bad yourself, monkey.

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.042
Caffeine patches are available 24 hours.

53
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And our mocha yoga classes are
offered in beginner or grande.

54
00:04:54.084 --> 00:04:57.042
Over here, indoor sports,
those are encouraged.

55
00:04:57.042 --> 00:05:00.000
Oh, cool. I've never played volleyball.

56
00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.000
Well, neither have they.

57
00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:02.042
You'll fit right in.

58
00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.042
Can your ideas change the world?

59
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.042
Behold, the motivation pod.

60
00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:09.084
Can your ideas change the world?

61
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.500
I know, right?

62
00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:12.000
Quinoa latte?

63
00:05:12.042 --> 00:05:13.042
Absolutely.

64
00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.042
Your ideas change the world.

65
00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:18.000
Gas tester V poster?

66
00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.042
They can. Mine too. So can mine.

67
00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:21.042
I have great ideas.

68
00:05:21.084 --> 00:05:24.000
Absolutely. I've got my idea pants on.

69
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Mmm. Finquinauts.

70
00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:37.042
Awesome! Hey, hey, excuse me.

71
00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:38.042
I'm Aww. I'm just...

72
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:44.042
Oh, that's not even a possibility
until our next vesting ceremony.

73
00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.042
Oh, what's that?

74
00:05:45.084 --> 00:05:50.042
That's where Chester V handpicks a great
inventor and makes him into a think-a-not.

75
00:05:50.042 --> 00:05:51.000
Win, win!

76
00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:57.042
Next one's in six months, so submit your
ideas and who knows, he might choose you.

77
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.000
Really?

78
00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.000
Hot chocolate with double
whipped whipped cream?

79
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.084
Thanks. Okay, Steve.

80
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We have six months until
the vesting ceremony.

81
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Let's do this thing.

82
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.084
Okay. That's the spirit, Steve.

83
00:06:36.042 --> 00:06:40.000
Say goodbye to ice cubes
with the Ree Freeza Fan.

84
00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:46.042
Can your ideas change the world?

85
00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:48.000
The Forkin' Knifein' Spooninator.

86
00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:54.042
The Grocery Deliverator.

87
00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:58.042
Can your ideas change the world?

88
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.042
Invisible Coffee Table.

89
00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:07.084
Ah! Great.

90
00:07:07.084 --> 00:07:14.042
Slick! The Celebrationator.

91
00:07:15.042 --> 00:07:17.042
A party in a box for any occasion.

92
00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:21.042
Okay, Steve. Time to celebrate.

93
00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:28.000
Ah! Here you go, Dad.

94
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Hope you like it. Steve picked it out.

95
00:07:37.084 --> 00:07:38.042
Steve! Woo hoo! Yeah! Top
of the leaderboard. Woo!

96
00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:40.084
You wanna follow me, Seth?

97
00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:42.042
Fire release.

98
00:07:42.042 --> 00:07:44.084
What? It's a level 15 strike, man.

99
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.042
You're mine for an hour.

100
00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:48.000
What? Loser, loser.

101
00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:50.042
Give that back. Ooh.

102
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.042
Come on. Really, guys?

103
00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:53.042
Not on top now, Noah.

104
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.042
Don't focus on the negative.

105
00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:56.042
It's very aging.

106
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.042
138 friends are laughing. Three
people are following Science Squad.

107
00:08:04.042 --> 00:08:06.042
Three people actually like science?

108
00:08:06.084 --> 00:08:10.042
Wow. Two people are following
Science Squad.

109
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.084
Um, I could follow you, Ava.

110
00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:15.042
I got a beebot.

111
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's just, it's at home,
um, downloading my profile.

112
00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:31.334
[both sobbing]

113
00:09:35.042 --> 00:09:36.042
dreams do come true.

114
00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:57.000
Oh, um... Okay.

115
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.042
Commencing Biodynamic Concealment
Test Number 83, batch 5.

116
00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:06.000
Exothermic reaction?

117
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That's an exothermic reaction.

118
00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:11.000
Uh, Lovey, could I borrow
a feather, please?

119
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.500
Thank you.

120
00:10:13.042 --> 00:10:14.042
Here's a little something for you.

121
00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:25.042
If this works, he'll have
to give me my job back.

122
00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:38.042
No way. It worked.

123
00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:38.542
It worked.

124
00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:50.042
Lovey, it worked.

125
00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:51.000
It worked.

126
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.042
What

127
00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.042
Wait, why do you need all that
to take me to the airport?

128
00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:54.000
The winner by total annihilation, Yama!

129
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Who's next?

130
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.042
Where's the guts to step into
the ring with little Yama?

131
00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.042
Can I try?

132
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I have a robot.

133
00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:14.042
I built it myself.

134
00:11:21.084 --> 00:11:22.042
Beat it, kid.

135
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.042
House rules.

136
00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:25.084
You gotta pay to play.

137
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Oh, uh, is this enough?

138
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
What's your name, little boy?

139
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.500
Hero?

140
00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:34.000
Hero Hamada?

141
00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:37.042
Prepare your bot, Zero.

142
00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:53.042
Two bots enter, one bot leaves.

143
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.500
Fighters ready?

144
00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:07.542
Fight!

145
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
That was my first fight.

146
00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.000
Can I try again?

147
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
No one likes a sword loser, little boy.

148
00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:16.000
Go home.

149
00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:17.000
I've got more money.

150
00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.042
Fighters ready? Fight!

151
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Mega Bot, destroy.

152
00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:35.084
Huh? No

153
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
more little Yama.

154
00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:05.000
But what?

155
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.042
This is not possible.

156
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

157
00:13:10.042 --> 00:13:11.042
Beginner's luck.

158
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Do you want to go again, Yama?

159
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.042
No one hustles Yama.

160
00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:17.042
Whoa, hey.

161
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.500
Teach him a lesson.

162
00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:21.000
Hey, fellas.

163
00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:25.000
Let's talk about this.

164
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Hero, get up.

165
00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:29.042
Todashi. Oh, good timing.

166
00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:33.042
Ha ha ha ha.

167
00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:36.042
Oh, mama.

168
00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:43.042
You okay? Yeah.

169
00:13:43.042 --> 00:13:44.042
Are you hurt? No.

170
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.042
Then what were you thinking, knucklehead?

171
00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:54.000
You graduated high school when you
were 13, and this is what you're doing?

172
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.042
Bot fighting is illegal.

173
00:14:04.042 --> 00:14:06.042
You're gonna get yourself arrested.

174
00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:09.000
Bot fighting is not illegal.

175
00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:13.000
Betting on bot fighting, that's
illegal, but so lucrative.

176
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.042
Come on a roll, big brother.

177
00:14:14.084 --> 00:14:16.042
And there is no stopping me.

178
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.042
Oh, no.

179
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.084
Trespassing, burglary, mayhem,
assault with a deadly reptile?

180
00:14:33.042 --> 00:14:36.042
As if those poor rodents haven't
been through enough already.

181
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.500
Diane, please.

182
00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:39.084
Oh, okay.

183
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.042
I'm sorry, professor, but
I'm calling the chief.

184
00:14:42.042 --> 00:14:43.000
Please, come on.

185
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.042
This experiment is over.

186
00:14:45.042 --> 00:14:47.000
Experiments?
You couldn't help yourself.

187
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.042
So I had a moment of weakness.

188
00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:50.042
Sue me. It's gonna be difficult
to do from prison.

189
00:14:50.042 --> 00:14:52.000
Guys, what do we do now?

190
00:14:55.042 --> 00:14:57.042
Time to launch that charm offensive.

191
00:14:58.042 --> 00:15:01.000
Oh, yeah, the fool Clooney.

192
00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:04.000
Madame Governor, Diane.

193
00:15:04.042 --> 00:15:06.042
Do not Clooney me, wolf.

194
00:15:06.084 --> 00:15:07.084
Oh, I see what's going on.

195
00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:09.000
I think I'm still a bad guy.

196
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.042
Trying to bamboozle my way to freedom.

197
00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:12.042
But we've changed.

198
00:15:12.084 --> 00:15:15.042
That flower of goodness is
blossoming all over the place.

199
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Don't you ever get tired of lying?

200
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:19.000
No.

201
00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:21.000
I mean, fudge.

202
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
That was a trick question, right?

203
00:15:23.084 --> 00:15:28.042
I gave you an opportunity, a chance to
show the world that you're more than just a

204
00:15:28.042 --> 00:15:34.000
scary stereotype, but you're too proud
or too gutless to take advantage of it.

205
00:15:34.042 --> 00:15:35.000
Gutless?

206
00:15:35.042 --> 00:15:36.042
I'm gutless?

207
00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:38.042
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:40.084
Have we met? I'm the
villain of every story.

209
00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:44.084
Guilty until proven innocent, even
if by some miracle we did change.

210
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.084
Who's going to believe us, huh?

211
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Of course you wouldn't know anything about
that with your little miss perfect power

212
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.500
suits.

213
00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:54.000
Is that so?

214
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Wait a second.
What did...

215
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.042
How did you... A wolf and
a fox are not so different.

216
00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:04.084
Maybe they will believe you.

217
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Maybe they won't.

218
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But it doesn't matter.

219
00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:08.042
Don't do it for them.

220
00:16:08.084 --> 00:16:09.042
Do it for you.

221
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.042
This is a chance to write your own story,
to find a better life for you and your

222
00:16:14.042 --> 00:16:16.084
friends. Come on.

223
00:16:16.084 --> 00:16:17.084
What have you got to lose?

224
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.042
I don't know.
My dignity?

225
00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:24.042
Yeah, well, that ship has already sailed.

226
00:16:30.084 --> 00:16:33.000
Believe it or not, I'm
rooting for you, wolf.

227
00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:35.084
So you're not going to call the chief?

228
00:16:35.084 --> 00:16:38.042
I'll see you at the gala.

229
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.042
Mother of pearl.

230
00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:57.000
Here we go.

231
00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:05.042
Yeah, if my parents found out I
was up here, wolf, it would be bad.

232
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Thank you, but...

233
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.042
Killed it per usual.

234
00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:09.042
Check it out.

235
00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:14.042
I'm

236
00:17:14.084 --> 00:17:15.000
Oh my gosh.

237
00:17:17.042 --> 00:17:20.000
Tyler is an insecure jerkwad.

238
00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:21.042
Words were exchanged.

239
00:17:21.084 --> 00:17:22.042
He's dead.

240
00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.000
I killed him.

241
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.042
Alright. Man oh man of shavits.

242
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
That looked so fun.

243
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Yes, can I be a pop-up?

244
00:17:38.042 --> 00:17:41.042
I don't know. Can you
be annoyingly aggressive?

245
00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:42.000
I don't know.

246
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can
I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I?

247
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.084
Can I? Oh, yes.

248
00:17:50.084 --> 00:17:51.000
You're perfect. Here.

249
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Thank you.
Well, if you're going, I want to go.

250
00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:55.042
No, baby. You gotta stay
here and be my movie star.

251
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:56.042
What? No, no, no.

252
00:17:56.042 --> 00:17:58.042
Me and the kid are like shoes and socks.

253
00:17:58.084 --> 00:18:00.000
Or peanut butter and bacon.

254
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
One cannot exist without the other.

255
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Go on, kid, tell her.

256
00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:04.000
It's true.

257
00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:09.000
In fact, it's so true that we will
be fine if we're apart for a minute.

258
00:18:09.042 --> 00:18:10.042
Come on, pal.

259
00:18:10.084 --> 00:18:12.042
It's my game we're trying to save.

260
00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:14.042
I just want to get out
there and be useful.

261
00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:15.042
Without me?

262
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
What if you get lost?

263
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.500
You're just a kid.

264
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Oh, and you're some mature adult.

265
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Well, I'm bigger.

266
00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:24.000
Don't be insecure, big fella.

267
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.042
She's not going to get lost, I promise.

268
00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:28.042
She'll be in my personal wet browser.

269
00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:34.084
And your app comes with Buzz Face,
so you can keep in touch anywhere on the

270
00:18:34.084 --> 00:18:35.000
internet.

271
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.042
See?
I'll be fine.

272
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.042
I know.
I just...

273
00:18:42.084 --> 00:18:45.000
We haven't been apart in like six years.

274
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.042
I'm going to miss you.

275
00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:52.000
You'll be fine, too. The
more hearts your videos get,

276
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the faster we'll get the wheel
and then we can go home.

277
00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:59.000
Look, we'll be celebrating the
tappers this time tomorrow, buddy.

278
00:18:59.042 --> 00:19:01.042
Yeah, I guess you're right.

279
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Bye! Be careful, huh? Don't be a dummy.

280
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
So where exactly are you sending her?

281
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.042
Well, since Candy Girl
comes from an arcade game,

282
00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:18.000
I'm thinking she'd be good
in the gaming district.

283
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.042
Oh, no, no, no, no. Bad idea.

284
00:19:20.084 --> 00:19:23.000
Those games are dangerous
and they rot your brain.

285
00:19:23.042 --> 00:19:27.042
Why don't we send her somewhere a little
more totally different than that and

286
00:19:27.042 --> 00:19:29.000
nowhere near there.

287
00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:30.042
Let's see.

288
00:19:30.042 --> 00:19:32.084
Family-friendly fan sites.

289
00:19:32.084 --> 00:19:34.000
That sounds safe.

290
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And she is technically a princess, so
how about this one here with the sweet little

291
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.500
pink castle?

292
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I love it. Okay, I'll redirect
our newest pop-up to OhMyDisney.

293
00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:44.000
com.

294
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.042
There you go. Those are Fred's.

295
00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:02.042
Go crazy. Oh.

296
00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:07.000
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

297
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.500
Good boy.

298
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Mr. Gru?
Well, I did what, yes?

299
00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:13.000
Hi.

300
00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:16.000
Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL. Oh.

301
00:20:16.084 --> 00:20:17.000
Whoops.

302
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.084
Ahem.
Sorry. You're gonna have to come with me.

303
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Oh, sorry.

304
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I... PRAISE EYE! You know, you really
should announce your weapons after you fire

305
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.084
them, Mr. Gru. For example...

306
00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:39.084
Get out!

307
00:20:39.084 --> 00:20:50.042
Lipstick taser! Oh,
it works so good. Man.

308
00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:54.000
Large. Person.

309
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.042
Oh. Sorry.

310
00:21:07.042 --> 00:21:18.042
Get in there, you big... Ah!

311
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Whoa! Whoa!

312
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.042
Ah! I'm about my money,
I ain't worth a...

313
00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:47.042
for s'il's sake.

314
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Pinz and D'vils!

315
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.042
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

316
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.042
I apologize for our methods
in getting you in.

317
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.500
I don't.

318
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

319
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.042
I am not gonna lie, I enjoyed that.

320
00:24:27.042 --> 00:24:30.000
Every second of it gave me
a bit of a buzz, actually.

321
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.084
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

322
00:24:32.042 --> 00:24:32.542
Sorry.

323
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Okay, this is bogus!

324
00:24:36.042 --> 00:24:39.042
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

325
00:24:39.042 --> 00:24:45.000
We are the Anti-Villain League, an ultra-secret
organization dedicated to fighting

326
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
crime on a global scale.

327
00:24:47.084 --> 00:24:49.084
Rob a bank? We're not interested.

328
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.042
Kill someone, not our deal.

329
00:24:52.042 --> 00:24:58.042
But you want to melt the polar
ice caps, or vaporize Mount Fuji,

330
00:24:58.042 --> 00:25:01.000
or even steal the moon?

331
00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:03.000
Then we notice.

332
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.042
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

333
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Second, after I did
do that, I put it back.

334
00:25:10.084 --> 00:25:12.042
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

335
00:25:12.042 --> 00:25:14.000
That's why we brought you here.

336
00:25:14.084 --> 00:25:17.084
I am the League's Director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

337
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.500
Bottom.

338
00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:24.042
Hilarious.

339
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Agent Wilde.

340
00:25:27.084 --> 00:25:32.042
Oh, me now? Um, recently an entire top
secret lab disappeared from the Arctic

341
00:25:32.042 --> 00:25:35.000
Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.

342
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.500
Just...

343
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.500
gone.

344
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Where did it go?

345
00:25:39.042 --> 00:25:40.000
I don't care.

346
00:25:40.084 --> 00:25:41.000
Hmm.

347
00:25:41.042 --> 00:25:46.000
The lab was devoted to experiments
involving PX41, a transmutation serum.

348
00:25:46.042 --> 00:25:48.000
What is PX41, you ask?

349
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
It's pretty bad.

350
00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:12.084
Look. Oh, you usually don't
see that in bunnies.

351
00:26:13.042 --> 00:26:18.084
As you can see, in the wrong hands, the
PX41 serum could be the most devastating

352
00:26:18.084 --> 00:26:19.084
weapon on Earth.

353
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.042
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

354
00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:32.000
And using the latest chem tracking
technology, we found traces of it in the

355
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Paradise Mall.

356
00:26:33.084 --> 00:26:34.042
A mall?

357
00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:39.042
Precisely. And we believe that one of
these shop owners is a master criminal.

358
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
And that's where you come in.

359
00:26:41.042 --> 00:26:44.000
As an ex-villain, you know
how a villain thinks.

360
00:26:44.042 --> 00:26:45.042
How a villain acts.

361
00:26:45.042 --> 00:26:48.084
The plan is to set you up undercover
at a shop in the mall,

362
00:26:48.084 --> 00:26:51.000
where hopefully you'll be able to...

363
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Okay, I see where this is going, with
all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no, no!

364
00:26:56.042 --> 00:26:57.042
Leave me father alone.

365
00:26:57.042 --> 00:27:00.000
And a legitimate businessman.

366
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.084
I am developing a line of
delicious jams and jellies.

367
00:27:04.042 --> 00:27:05.084
Heh heh.

368
00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:09.000
Jams and jellies. Oh, attitude.

369
00:27:09.042 --> 00:27:12.000
That's right. So thanks, but no thanks.

370
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And here's a tip. Instead of
tasing people and kidnapping them,

371
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
maybe you should just give them a call.

372
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.042
Good day, Mr. Sheep's Butt.

373
00:27:22.042 --> 00:27:24.042
Ram's bottom.

374
00:27:24.084 --> 00:27:26.000
Oh yeah, I like that's any better.

375
00:27:28.042 --> 00:27:28.542
Look,

376
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but your work as a villain was kind of

377
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.042
amazing. So if you ever want to
get back to doing something awesome,

378
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.500
give us a call.

379
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.084
Oh, we're running out of time.

380
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Fenton, what's wrong?

381
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
People are asking questions.

382
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:04.042
I'm putting too much on Huey.

383
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.084
It's time for the gizmo
cloud to go public.

384
00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:07.084
It's not ready.

385
00:28:07.084 --> 00:28:09.084
Let's let others help us make it ready.

386
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.042
The more minds, the merrier.

387
00:28:11.042 --> 00:28:15.000
The more minds, the more chances people
are going to shut the project down.

388
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.084
Gandra, please. It's not like letting
one person in is going to wreck everything.

389
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
This experiment means everything to me.

390
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Why can't we just keep this our secret?

391
00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:25.042
Because great science is worth sharing.

392
00:28:25.042 --> 00:28:27.000
But what if it all falls apart right now?

393
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.042
But once other people know, it'll
be just like any other project.

394
00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.084
They'll judge and poke holes.

395
00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:33.042
And what if I'm not good enough?

396
00:28:34.042 --> 00:28:36.084
The project, the cloud, I mean.

397
00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:42.000
I never cared about what people
thought about me until I met you.

398
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:46.000
And I don't care what anyone thinks
about us because I know you.

399
00:28:46.042 --> 00:28:46.542
Oh, Fenton.

400
00:28:47.084 --> 00:28:49.042
You know, I want you.

401
00:28:51.042 --> 00:28:54.000
It's not a secret I tried to hide.

402
00:28:55.042 --> 00:28:57.000
I know you want me.

403
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
So don't keep saying hands are tied.

404
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
You claim it's not in the cards.

405
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.042
Fate is pulling you miles
away and out of reach from me.

406
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.042
But you're here in my heart.

407
00:29:12.042 --> 00:29:20.042
So who can stop me if I decide
that you're my destiny?

408
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.084
What if we rewrite the stars?

409
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.042
Say you were made to be mine.

410
00:29:28.084 --> 00:29:31.042
Nothing could keep us apart.

411
00:29:32.042 --> 00:29:35.000
You'd be the one I was meant to find.

412
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.042
It's up to you and it's up to me.

413
00:29:40.042 --> 00:29:43.042
No one can say what we get to be.

414
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.042
So why don't we rewrite the stars?

415
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.084
Maybe the world could be yours tonight.

416
00:30:00.084 --> 00:30:01.000
You think it's easy?

417
00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:14.042
You think... But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk

418
00:30:16.084 --> 00:30:20.000
through I know you're wondering why Because
we're able to be just you and me Within

419
00:30:20.042 --> 00:30:31.000
these walls But when we... and see
that it was hopeless after all No

420
00:30:37.042 --> 00:30:57.084
one can rewrite the stars
How can you fake your mind?

421
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.000
you were See that the world
can be ours tonight...

422
00:31:06.042 --> 00:31:43.000
All I... me all of you It feels
impossible, is it impossible?

423
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.042
See that impossible See you were...

424
00:31:45.084 --> 00:32:09.000
me No one can say what we get Changing
the world to be ours Aw yeah!

425
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.042
Robots, I order you to
upload the kill code,

426
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
which I predicted but I'm not gonna make
a big deal about it, and save the world!

427
00:32:17.084 --> 00:32:20.000
Working on it, in a couple
minutes it's done!

428
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.042
Buuuut do you know what else is working?

429
00:32:23.084 --> 00:32:28.042
Pigeon! Aw dude, don't worry,
you'll make new friends,

430
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
and maybe you can meet another smart-
These guys aren't gonna abandon you,

431
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.500
they're part of-

432
00:32:43.042 --> 00:32:48.000
May I? Not this time,
lovey, thank you Ow!

433
00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Joker? Well, that's not good Woohoo!

434
00:33:29.042 --> 00:33:30.042
Woohoo! Good morning, Jules!

435
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:31.500
Hey,

436
00:33:41.084 --> 00:33:43.000
everyone, look what I found!

437
00:33:43.084 --> 00:33:44.000
Blue?

438
00:33:45.042 --> 00:33:46.000
Kids?

439
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.042
Where did everybody- Okay,
who's ready for some breakfast?

440
00:33:51.084 --> 00:33:52.042
Unbelievable.

441
00:33:55.042 --> 00:33:59.000
Did you know that these whole wheat pancakes
have twice the vitamins and minerals

442
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
of regular pancakes?

443
00:34:00.042 --> 00:34:02.084
And with the blueberries,
it's four times as tasty!

444
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.084
Hey, where are the blueberries?

445
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Oh, Dad! Looking for this?

446
00:34:11.042 --> 00:34:13.084
Bring it. It's down to the final minutes.

447
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
He's got magic in his feet!

448
00:34:15.042 --> 00:34:15.542
He shoots! He scores!

449
00:34:18.084 --> 00:34:20.042
Oh yeah, I got it, I'm good.

450
00:34:20.042 --> 00:34:23.000
Heads up, Dad! Uh oh.

451
00:34:34.084 --> 00:34:35.000
Awesome.

452
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.500
Hi, Mom!

453
00:34:41.042 --> 00:34:44.000
Busted. Time to both.

454
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Oh, hey honey, you hungry?

455
00:34:46.042 --> 00:34:48.042
Blue, we talked about this.

456
00:34:48.042 --> 00:34:51.000
Did we? Yeah, so what do you got there?

457
00:34:51.042 --> 00:34:52.042
Breakfast?

458
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.042
That's funny, but seriously,
what is that?

459
00:34:54.084 --> 00:34:56.000
It's a Brazil nut.

460
00:34:56.042 --> 00:34:58.042
I never thought I'd find
one this close to the city.

461
00:34:58.084 --> 00:35:00.000
I want to show the kids how to open one.

462
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
You mean like this?

463
00:35:02.042 --> 00:35:03.042
Dad already showed us!

464
00:35:04.042 --> 00:35:06.000
Wait, wait, wait, go back!

465
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.084
Mom!
Dad!

466
00:35:07.084 --> 00:35:13.042
You're on TV! The Birdman of Brazil
announced an important discovery today.

467
00:35:13.042 --> 00:35:18.042
We believe we have encountered a wild
blue spix macaw deep in the Amazon jungle.

468
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.042
The blue spix macaw was thought
to be practically extinct,

469
00:35:22.042 --> 00:35:26.084
with the last remaining family living
under protection at the Bluebird Sanctuary in

470
00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:27.042
Rio de Janeiro.

471
00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:28.042
We're famous!

472
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.042
If these birds can be found,
their home will be saved.

473
00:35:32.042 --> 00:35:35.042
There may be a whole flock
out there, and if there is,

474
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
we will fight them and protect them.

475
00:35:38.042 --> 00:35:39.000
Hi, Blue!

476
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.084
Hi, Linda! We're not the only ones.

477
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
There are more of us out there.

478
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Great, I'm sure there are...
All this time, I thought...

479
00:35:51.042 --> 00:35:52.042
I thought we were alone.

480
00:35:53.042 --> 00:35:55.042
Hey, that hasn't been all bad.

481
00:35:55.042 --> 00:36:00.042
Oh, of course not, but just imagine
if there was a whole flock of us.

482
00:36:02.042 --> 00:36:03.084
How amazing would that be?

483
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
We gotta do something.
We do?

484
00:36:08.042 --> 00:36:12.000
Yeah, we have to fly to the Amazon
and help Linda and Tulio find them!

485
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.042
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we can't
just pack up and go.

486
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
It's about time this family
got a little air under our wings.

487
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Why not?
Look at us! I-pods, TV, pancakes!

488
00:36:23.042 --> 00:36:25.042
We're not people, we're birds!

489
00:36:26.042 --> 00:36:29.000
We have to get out into
the wild and be birds, Blue!

490
00:36:29.042 --> 00:36:32.042
Let the kids connect to their
roots, show them what I had!

491
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.042
They need this.

492
00:36:34.042 --> 00:36:36.084
We need this. Come on,
Blue, what do you say?

493
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.042
Uh, I don't know.

494
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Maybe, uh...

495
00:36:40.042 --> 00:36:43.042
He didn't say no. Which means
he practically said yes.

496
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.042
It's gonna be so much fun!

497
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Yeah! Woo-hoo! We're going to the Amazon!
Wait, what's the Amazon?

498
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.084
And now, face the Bruce,
and action her cause.

499
00:36:55.084 --> 00:36:57.084
And what is the cause for we?

500
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
the real cause.
Oh, you damn toy.

501
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.042
Huh, you wear this.

502
00:37:18.042 --> 00:37:20.000
I didn't say that.

503
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Family. Huh, well, uh,
they got us to work.

504
00:37:26.042 --> 00:37:27.000
I'm right.

505
00:37:28.042 --> 00:37:32.000
Stop work! Back to the
way they got us work.

506
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Oh, sweetheart. Oh, sweetheart.

507
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:49.000
No man is to work.

508
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Like, how else?

509
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.500
Okay, no biggie.

510
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.042
You'll figure this out, Lee.
Just be the calm, mature adult.

511
00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:58.000
It's fine. We're gonna
head back to, uh...

512
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
You got this.

513
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.042
How about you?

514
00:38:02.042 --> 00:38:02.542
What'll you do when you win?

515
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.084
Wow, your life is so
much cooler than mine.

516
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I never go anywhere.

517
00:38:11.042 --> 00:38:12.084
I just dream about it.

518
00:38:14.084 --> 00:38:16.000
We're just being stupid.

519
00:38:17.042 --> 00:38:18.084
The panda's dangerous.

520
00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:20.042
Out of control.

521
00:38:21.084 --> 00:38:22.084
I think I know how you feel.

522
00:38:28.042 --> 00:38:34.042
My parents were gonna send me away.

523
00:38:34.042 --> 00:38:36.000
But it's over now. Because
it'll be amazing.

524
00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:39.042
Every day, me and Alberto
are gonna ride someplace new.

525
00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:41.000
And every night, we'll
sleep under the fish.

526
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.084
But I'm a monster.

527
00:38:46.084 --> 00:38:48.042
All our hopes and dreams
are pinned on me.

528
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.500
Silencio Bruno.

529
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:21.500
That's just

530
00:39:23.042 --> 00:39:24.000
I don't know.

531
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:45.042
And it's not over.

532
00:39:45.042 --> 00:39:46.084
We back on that race.

533
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
We won't crash on your
mark. Ready, set, go.

534
00:39:49.042 --> 00:39:51.000
Watch that snail doing that jab.

535
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.042
Born to be number one.

536
00:39:52.042 --> 00:39:54.000
Eat that deadly race fast.

537
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.042
Now that's battle to the metal.

538
00:39:57.084 --> 00:39:59.084
That's all the people see.

539
00:40:00.042 --> 00:40:11.042
You You see this man moving fast.

540
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.042
You You see him gaining position.

541
00:40:14.084 --> 00:40:19.000
But first he don't be lost.
He's ready to make a dash.

542
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:20.500
Let's get this man.

543
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.042
Mr. Ramsbottom?

544
00:40:31.084 --> 00:40:34.042
Oh, hello. What are you doing here?

545
00:40:34.042 --> 00:40:35.042
We got him.

546
00:40:35.084 --> 00:40:36.042
Got who?

547
00:40:36.084 --> 00:40:38.000
Floyd Eagleson.

548
00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:43.000
Our agents located a secret room in
his shop last night and discovered this.

549
00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:47.000
It's empty, but we found
traces of the PX410 a minute.

550
00:40:47.042 --> 00:40:48.042
He's our man.

551
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
So somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

552
00:40:53.042 --> 00:40:55.000
I was framed!

553
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.042
You won't get away with this!

554
00:40:56.084 --> 00:40:58.042
Get your mitts off of me!

555
00:40:58.042 --> 00:41:01.084
I am a legitimate businessman.

556
00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:03.000
Alright, so what now?

557
00:41:03.042 --> 00:41:05.084
Well, now you're free to
go back to your business.

558
00:41:06.042 --> 00:41:08.084
Mmm, jams and jellies.

559
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And it looks like Agent Wilde will
be transferring to our Australian branch.

560
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.500
Australia?

561
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Yes.

562
00:41:16.042 --> 00:41:18.000
But thank you for everything.

563
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.042
And by everything, of
course, I mean nothing.

564
00:41:21.042 --> 00:41:23.000
Toodle-pip and cheerio, Mr. Grew.

565
00:41:28.042 --> 00:41:29.000
Hey there.

566
00:41:29.042 --> 00:41:30.000
Hey.

567
00:41:30.042 --> 00:41:31.042
So, we got him.

568
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:32.500
Yay!

569
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
That's great.

570
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.084
And now you're going to Australia?

571
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.042
Well, it's not definite yet.

572
00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:39.084
Still figuring it out.

573
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.042
Already been working on my accent.

574
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.042
Wallaby, Dejuree-doo, Hugh Jackman.

575
00:41:47.042 --> 00:41:50.042
So, um, pretty excited.

576
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.500
Great.

577
00:41:53.042 --> 00:41:55.042
Well, good luck.

578
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.500
Thanks.

579
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.500
You too.

580
00:41:59.042 --> 00:42:00.042
Oh, here.

581
00:42:00.042 --> 00:42:02.000
I wanted to give you this.

582
00:42:02.084 --> 00:42:04.000
Your lipstick taser?

583
00:42:04.042 --> 00:42:06.000
Yeah, it's just a memento.

584
00:42:06.042 --> 00:42:09.084
Just, you know, from
the first time we met.

585
00:42:10.042 --> 00:42:12.042
Oh, thank you, Lucy.

586
00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:14.000
Agent Wilde?

587
00:42:15.084 --> 00:42:18.042
Well, it looks like they need you, so...

588
00:42:18.084 --> 00:42:20.042
Yeah, I, uh, I better go.

589
00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:23.042
Bye, Grew.

590
00:42:30.042 --> 00:42:31.042
We're running out of time.

591
00:42:31.042 --> 00:42:32.042
Fenton, what's wrong?

592
00:42:32.042 --> 00:42:33.084
People are asking questions.

593
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I'm putting too much on Hughie.

594
00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:37.042
It's time for the gizmo
cloud to go public.

595
00:42:37.042 --> 00:42:38.000
It's not ready.

596
00:42:38.042 --> 00:42:40.042
Let's let others help us make it ready.

597
00:42:40.042 --> 00:42:42.000
The more minds, the merrier.

598
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.042
The more minds, the more chances
people are gonna shut the project down.

599
00:42:45.042 --> 00:42:49.042
Gandra, please. It's not like letting
one person in is gonna wreck everything.

600
00:42:49.042 --> 00:42:51.042
This experiment means everything to me.

601
00:42:51.042 --> 00:42:53.084
Why can't we just keep this our secret?

602
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Because great science is worth sharing.

603
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
But what if it all falls apart?

604
00:42:57.042 --> 00:42:59.042
Right now it's just us,
but once other people know,

605
00:42:59.042 --> 00:43:01.000
it'll be just like any other project.

606
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.042
They'll judge and poke holes and...

607
00:43:02.042 --> 00:43:04.000
What if I'm not good enough?

608
00:43:05.042 --> 00:43:07.042
The project, the cloud, I mean...

609
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.042
I never cared about what people
thought about me until I met you.

610
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
And I don't care what anyone thinks
about us, because I know you.

611
00:43:16.084 --> 00:43:17.000
Oh, Fenton.

612
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.084
Dangerous food creatures detected.

613
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Stay put.

614
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:32.000
We'll find a destroyer.

615
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.084
You better hide him. Hey gang, today's
the day we find the Flintstones on Earth.

616
00:43:38.084 --> 00:43:39.000
Barry! You can't be here.

617
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Sam, I was thinking about
what you said last night.

618
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:42.500
Anyone?

619
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.500
What?

620
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.500
Me too!

621
00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:50.000
Right. Listen, I have been acting weird,
but it's only because I'm under a lot of

622
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:50.542
pressure.
Anyone?

623
00:43:51.042 --> 00:43:54.042
What?
So true! But I'm also doing this for us.

624
00:43:55.042 --> 00:43:59.000
You see, I still want Sparkswood
to happen, but it can't.

625
00:43:59.084 --> 00:44:02.084
Not until I become a great
inventor like Chester V. Flint,

626
00:44:02.084 --> 00:44:04.084
you don't have to prove anything.

627
00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:06.000
Oh, Lockwood!

628
00:44:06.042 --> 00:44:08.000
How goes the inventing?

629
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.042
Uh, very good, sir.

630
00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:11.042
I was up all night making this.

631
00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:16.042
I call it the Flint Lockwood Food Jungle
Topographical Pointing Machine, or...

632
00:44:16.042 --> 00:44:17.042
The Flift-a-tip-em!

633
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.500
Brilliant!

634
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Thank you, sir.
Follow the beam, find the machine.

635
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.084
All I have to do now
is cut the leg holes.

636
00:44:25.084 --> 00:44:27.084
Ooh. Huh.

637
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.042
Well, maybe it's better here.

638
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Great idea, Sam.

639
00:44:34.042 --> 00:44:36.000
And guys, you can help me by, uh...

640
00:44:36.042 --> 00:44:39.084
Excuse us. Your friends are
distracting you from our mission.

641
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.042
Distracting? My chest hairs
just don't trust that, Chester.

642
00:44:44.042 --> 00:44:47.084
We should be hunting the Flit-a-smitters
for not chit-chatting.

643
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.042
But, sir, I... ...am heading into
the deepest, darkest part of the jungle.

644
00:44:54.042 --> 00:44:56.042
You need to focus on saving the world.

645
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Be a hero.

646
00:45:00.042 --> 00:45:02.000
Okay, you're right, sir.

647
00:45:02.042 --> 00:45:04.000
Excellent!
Let's go!

648
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Okay, Barry, time to go home now.

649
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.042
Okay, okay.
Okay, one more hug, Barry.

650
00:45:14.042 --> 00:45:14.542
Ready?
Right.

651
00:45:15.084 --> 00:45:18.042
Barry. You, Barry.

652
00:45:19.042 --> 00:45:22.042
And I'm Sam Sparks.

653
00:45:24.084 --> 00:45:29.042
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,
Barry, time to go home now.

654
00:45:29.042 --> 00:45:30.042
Now go.

655
00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:32.042
You go on home.

656
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.042
Bye. Okay, now that we're all really comfortable,
I can't wait for you guys to see

657
00:45:44.042 --> 00:45:45.042
my new movie.

658
00:45:45.084 --> 00:45:46.042
I think it might be a masterpiece.

659
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Kitty Glitter.

660
00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:53.084
It's scientifically proven that watching
kittens causes the enterochromatin cells

661
00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:55.000
to release serotonin.

662
00:45:58.042 --> 00:45:58.542
Amazon!
Let's go!

663
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Come on, Dad, come on!
Okay, bug spray, check.

664
00:46:02.042 --> 00:46:03.084
Water purifier, check.

665
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:04.500
Band-aids.

666
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.042
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

667
00:46:06.042 --> 00:46:09.042
The all-in-one adventurer's knife.

668
00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:09.542
Call

669
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.042
That's not for you.

670
00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:17.000
Did you know the Amazon has snakes
that can swallow you whole?

671
00:46:17.042 --> 00:46:20.042
Actually, Bia, all those stories
are highly exaggerated.

672
00:46:20.084 --> 00:46:21.084
No, really, look.

673
00:46:24.042 --> 00:46:24.542
That's sick.

674
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
All right, we ready to go?

675
00:46:29.042 --> 00:46:31.084
A fanny pack? Yeah, Linda gave it to me.

676
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
I need it for the GPS.
Oh, what's the GPS? Hey!

677
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.042
Carla, we're leaving.

678
00:46:36.042 --> 00:46:39.042
I'm not going. It's gonna be lame.

679
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Okay, here it is.

680
00:46:41.042 --> 00:46:43.042
The voice recognition makes
it totally foolproof.

681
00:46:43.084 --> 00:46:46.084
Here, watch this. Find Linda and Tulio.

682
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Searching for dinner in Tokyo.

683
00:46:49.084 --> 00:46:50.042
Oh, okay.

684
00:46:50.042 --> 00:46:52.042
Well, actually, that does
sound like a nice suggestion.

685
00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:53.042
You trust this woman?

686
00:46:53.084 --> 00:46:54.042
Yes, I do.

687
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.042
It's okay, Dad, really.

688
00:46:58.084 --> 00:46:59.042
These are great.

689
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.042
A plane trip to Miami.

690
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.042
It's been 60 years and you go
all the way there for one show.

691
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
For one song.

692
00:47:08.042 --> 00:47:09.084
Oh, I do, I do.

693
00:47:09.084 --> 00:47:13.084
I mean, not much, but just
a song my mom used to sing.

694
00:47:14.042 --> 00:47:17.042
They say that art reveals more
about the viewer than the artist.

695
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Mr. Poodleton.

696
00:47:19.084 --> 00:47:21.000
parents found out I was up here.

697
00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:23.042
It would be bad.

698
00:47:23.084 --> 00:47:25.000
So, thank you, but.

699
00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.042
Killed it per usual.

700
00:47:26.084 --> 00:47:27.042
Check it out.

701
00:47:28.042 --> 00:47:38.042
Tyler is an insecure jerkwad.

702
00:47:38.042 --> 00:47:42.042
Words works. The plan is to set you
up undercover at a shop in the mall where

703
00:47:42.042 --> 00:47:43.042
hopefully you'll be able to.

704
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.042
Yeah, I see where this is going with all
the Mission Impossible stuff, but no, no.

705
00:47:50.084 --> 00:47:52.000
What are you even talking about?

706
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.042
Oh, we're going to the internet.

707
00:47:53.042 --> 00:47:53.542
What?

708
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Yeah, to find the part to fix your game.

709
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.084
Yeah, I probably should have just
said we're going to the internet.

710
00:47:58.084 --> 00:48:14.000
No way!
We're going to the internet! hey,

711
00:48:27.084 --> 00:48:32.042
hey, hey.

712
00:48:32.084 --> 00:48:36.042
Please, Kevin, Jerry, watch
the girls for me, okay?

713
00:48:36.084 --> 00:48:39.042
Dave, Stewart, come this way with me.

714
00:48:39.042 --> 00:48:39.542
Come on.

715
00:50:36.042 --> 00:50:38.042
We're stealth ninjas.

716
00:50:39.042 --> 00:50:41.000
We make no sound. Right.

717
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Gotcha. Alright, Hamacho.

718
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
You're going down.

719
00:50:50.042 --> 00:50:50.542
Wait, wait.

720
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:51.500
What?

721
00:50:53.042 --> 00:50:54.084
What are you doing?

722
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I'm checking for laser
beam alarm triggers.

723
00:50:57.042 --> 00:51:00.000
It's a restaurant!

724
00:51:00.042 --> 00:51:02.042
You never know what kind of booby
traps this guy could have said.

725
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.084
Huh?
Come on. There are no booby traps.

726
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.042
Ha! Booby!

727
00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.000
Oh, there's a chicken.

728
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.084
Are you lost, little guy?

729
00:51:24.042 --> 00:51:25.000
You must be lost.

730
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Some guard dog.

731
00:51:31.042 --> 00:51:31.542
Whoa!

732
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Oh no, no, no!

733
00:51:33.084 --> 00:51:34.042
Get it off of me!

734
00:51:42.459 --> 00:51:43.458
I got you!

735
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.042
What is wrong with that chicken?

736
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.042
Hey, that polo is loco.

737
00:52:17.042 --> 00:52:18.000
No?

738
00:52:18.084 --> 00:52:29.000
Okay, let's go. You getting anything?

739
00:52:29.042 --> 00:52:30.042
No, not yet.

740
00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:33.042
But hey, maybe you can find
something with these x-rays.

741
00:52:33.042 --> 00:52:43.042
How are they working?

742
00:52:43.084 --> 00:52:50.042
Oh, that's an image I'll
never get out of my brain.

743
00:52:53.042 --> 00:53:01.000
Ah! I knew it!

744
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.042
The serum is in here!

745
00:53:02.084 --> 00:53:08.042
Oh, this is going to be good.

746
00:53:08.042 --> 00:53:15.042
Ah! Ah!

747
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.500
What?

748
00:53:19.042 --> 00:53:24.042
Salsa? Oh, it's a Oh.

749
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Somebody's going to die tonight.

750
00:53:37.084 --> 00:53:40.042
Pajito! What did I do to you?

751
00:53:40.042 --> 00:53:41.042
Pajito, can you hear me?

752
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken?

753
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:46.500
What?

754
00:53:47.042 --> 00:53:49.000
Who's there?
Uh-oh.

755
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
You coming out? Where am I going?

756
00:53:51.042 --> 00:53:51.542
munchkins.

757
00:54:09.042 --> 00:54:10.000
been spotted.

758
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.500
Come get us.

759
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.500
Hey, look who we have left.

760
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:13.542
I have you now Huh?
Yay! Gerato!

761
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Doba! Doba!

762
00:54:34.042 --> 00:54:54.000
Hey!
Gerato! Pachaya Gerato!

763
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.042
Oh no!
Oh no!

764
00:54:59.042 --> 00:55:01.000
Oh no! Oh no!

765
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.042
Oh no!

766
00:55:03.042 --> 00:55:05.042
Huh? Ooh! Kirito!

767
00:55:30.667 --> 00:55:32.667
Yay! Ice cream!

768
00:56:40.042 --> 00:56:42.000
delts for days.

769
00:56:42.042 --> 00:56:43.000
Forget that!

770
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.042
I'm starting to black out!

771
00:56:46.042 --> 00:56:47.042
I think I'm getting carpal tunnel.

772
00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:49.000
No pain, no gain, Priya.

773
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.042
Come on, chop chop! Five, ten.

774
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000
The concert's this Saturday
and we're still a hundred short!

775
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.084
I knew we should've charged
more for photos.

776
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.084
Ah! Stupid stupid stupid!
May, breathe.

777
00:57:02.042 --> 00:57:03.000
It's in the bag.

778
00:57:04.042 --> 00:57:07.042
What? What's the point of getting to
the concert if you're too exhausted to enjoy

779
00:57:07.042 --> 00:57:11.042
it? Now take a break and
help me appreciate some boys.

780
00:57:12.042 --> 00:57:15.042
Okay, okay, okay.

781
00:57:15.042 --> 00:57:16.084
Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up?

782
00:57:17.084 --> 00:57:19.000
Oh, looking good!

783
00:57:19.042 --> 00:57:21.000
Nice catch!

784
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.042
Are you a triangle?
Cause you look cute!

785
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
That is so weird.

786
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.084
Are you spying on us?

787
00:57:28.084 --> 00:57:30.000
I wanna talk to you, Lee.

788
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.042
Forget it.

789
00:57:30.042 --> 00:57:34.084
Fine. Wonder if your mom knows her precious
little maymay has been flaunting the

790
00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:42.000
panda all over school.

791
00:57:42.042 --> 00:57:47.042
That's part of your business! Now
put that thing away and hear me out.

792
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.042
What do you want?

793
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I wanna throw a sick birthday party.

794
00:57:54.042 --> 00:58:00.000
An epic one. It's this Friday.

795
00:58:00.042 --> 00:58:01.084
If you're there, everyone will come.

796
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.042
Simple as that. A party?

797
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.042
Look, I've done you a favor
keeping my mouth shut.

798
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000
All I'm asking for is one back.

799
00:58:13.042 --> 00:58:14.000
Hmm.

800
00:58:14.042 --> 00:58:16.042
I'll do it.

801
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
But it'll cost you one.

802
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
No, 200 bucks.

803
00:58:21.042 --> 00:58:21.542
Okay.

804
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Hold, please.

805
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:26.042
Are you serious?

806
00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:27.042
You can't trust him.

807
00:58:27.042 --> 00:58:30.000
It's a trap. This sounds
like a boy-girl party.

808
00:58:30.042 --> 00:58:31.084
Are we allowed to boy-girl parties?

809
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.084
Guys, 200 bucks will put us over the top.

810
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.042
We have to do this.

811
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.042
We'll meet at Tyler's, I'll do
my thing, and then we'll bounce.

812
00:58:39.042 --> 00:58:41.000
Easy peasy.

813
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Dude, what about your mom?

814
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Forget my mom.

815
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
I'll be back before she
even knows I'm gone.

816
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
But, hey, Dorkbag, we're in.

817
00:58:47.042 --> 00:58:49.042
But you only get the panda for an hour.

818
00:58:49.084 --> 00:58:52.000
And we're not bringing any presents.

819
00:58:52.042 --> 00:58:57.000
Deal. I told you not to trust that woman.

820
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
That's a Heliconius larva.

821
00:59:00.042 --> 00:59:02.000
It's about to enter the pupa stage.

822
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
You said poop. Hey,
kids, kids, stay close.

823
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.042
I'll get them. Okay, you guys stay put.

824
00:59:10.042 --> 00:59:11.042
I'll look around.

825
00:59:11.042 --> 00:59:13.000
No worries. We'll be here.

826
00:59:13.042 --> 00:59:14.084
We're not going anywhere.

827
00:59:15.042 --> 00:59:17.000
My feathers is popping
up in the back of my neck.

828
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.042
I don't like this.

829
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Let's back it up. Beep.

830
00:59:20.084 --> 00:59:21.000
Beep.

831
00:59:21.042 --> 00:59:22.000
Beep.

832
00:59:22.042 --> 00:59:22.542
Beep.

833
00:59:23.042 --> 00:59:27.042
Mia? Tiago?

834
00:59:29.042 --> 00:59:30.042
Come on, lady.

835
00:59:31.042 --> 00:59:34.042
Don't let me down. Calculating
route to Funkytown.

836
00:59:34.042 --> 00:59:43.042
Oh, great. Okay, guys.

837
00:59:43.042 --> 00:59:43.542
Guys?

838
00:59:44.042 --> 00:59:51.000
Good one, guys.

839
00:59:51.042 --> 00:59:52.000
Very funny.

840
00:59:52.084 --> 00:59:54.000
Good. Good. Very witty.

841
00:59:55.042 --> 00:59:57.000
Jewel, where are you?

842
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.084
Kids? Jewel?

843
01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:03.542
It's a macaw!

844
01:00:05.084 --> 01:00:17.042
Let me go! Let me go, you heathens!

845
01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:18.042
Blue? I swear that sounded like Blue.

846
01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.042
That's impossible.

847
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.042
He's back home in Rio, safe and sound.

848
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.042
I am an American citizen, you savage!

849
01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.042
I demand to see my ambassador!

850
01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:28.042
I know my rights!

851
01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:33.042
I know my rights! Back, you barbarian!

852
01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:35.084
Yeah, that's right.

853
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.084
It's a spoon and a fork.

854
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

855
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:42.000
Whoa, whoa, buddy!

856
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.042
Put the spork down.

857
01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:46.000
Let me go! Let me go!

858
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.042
Put me down! You lucky I ain't big!

859
01:00:47.084 --> 01:01:04.000
You lucky I ain't big!

860
01:01:16.084 --> 01:01:18.042
I can't believe we found them!

861
01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:21.000
Well, technically, they found us.

862
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Okay, we're gonna need some name tags.

863
01:01:24.084 --> 01:01:27.000
Whoa, ah, hello, ah, okay, ah.

864
01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.042
No, no, those are breath mints.

865
01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.042
Ah, not that you need
one, but they're good.

866
01:01:30.042 --> 01:01:34.042
You eat them. Oh, whoa, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, not the whole box!

867
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.500
Get that out of here!

868
01:01:39.084 --> 01:01:41.042
What is this doing here?

869
01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:44.084
What's going on? We found them
flying too close to the humans.

870
01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:46.042
What? And who are you?

871
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.084
Ah, is not an appropriate answer.

872
01:01:48.084 --> 01:01:51.000
I ask you a question.
Where did you come from?

873
01:01:51.084 --> 01:01:52.000
Hey, back off!

874
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.084
Hey, excuse me, young lady.

875
01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.042
I can't believe it.

876
01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:01.042
How, how, how, how is this?

877
01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:08.000
When the loggers came, there was
fire and so much smoke and, and, and...

878
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.042
I had you under my wing
and, and then you were...

879
01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.000
Gone. I've looked everywhere for you.

880
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.500
I'm here.

881
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:19.500
Daddy! Daddy?

882
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.042
I missed you.

883
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.042
It's okay. It's okay now.

884
01:02:28.042 --> 01:02:34.000
Daddy has you. Look at you.

885
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
It's my little girl.

886
01:03:01.084 --> 01:03:03.042
A very unpleasant fall.

887
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Finish the job, Lockwood.

888
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Yes, sir. Made it!

889
01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:47.000
Flitch the film on her.

890
01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:54.000
Look, I'm sorry I have to do this to you.

891
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Again. But I can't let your swimming
cheese spiders destroy Lady Liberty

892
01:04:11.084 --> 01:04:56.084
or the world.

893
01:05:02.042 --> 01:05:03.042
Oh! Oh!

894
01:05:05.084 --> 01:05:06.084
Sir! Sir, there it is.

895
01:05:07.084 --> 01:05:08.042
In all its glory.

896
01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:11.084
Chester, look, I can't do this.

897
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Oh, okay.
I will.

898
01:05:13.084 --> 01:05:15.042
What? Wait. Chester, wait.

899
01:05:15.084 --> 01:05:16.084
We can't destroy it.

900
01:05:17.042 --> 01:05:18.000
Ah!

901
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.042
Let go of me, Lockwood.

902
01:05:19.042 --> 01:05:20.000
No, sir.

903
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.917
I can't let you do this.

904
01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:32.375
No! No! Nooooooo!

905
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.084
BS USB... reprogrammed it?

906
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
It was never gonna turn off the machine.

907
01:05:44.042 --> 01:05:47.042
A BS USB. Hello?

908
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.084
Your machine is what I wanted all along.

909
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:52.500
You...

910
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.042
lied to me.

911
01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:56.000
Of course I lied to you.

912
01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:59.000
I knew you'd eventually fall
for these pathetic creatures.

913
01:05:59.000 --> 01:05:59.500
But...

914
01:06:00.042 --> 01:06:01.042
but you were my idol.

915
01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:04.042
My whole life I looked up to you.

916
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.042
I wanted to be you!

917
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.042
Oh, Lockwood.

918
01:06:08.084 --> 01:06:11.000
I was just using you
to get your invention.

919
01:06:11.042 --> 01:06:12.000
We're ready.

920
01:06:12.042 --> 01:06:14.042
Launch operation slice and dice.

921
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:22.500
Ah!

922
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And now that I've got what
I want, I no longer need you.

923
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I'm afraid we're going
to have to let you...

924
01:06:32.709 --> 01:06:33.667
Wait, wait, wait. No, no, please.

925
01:07:41.042 --> 01:07:43.084
heh. Oh.

926
01:07:45.042 --> 01:07:48.042
That's not natural. Okay, Steve. Me and
you put our two brilliant minds together.

927
01:07:48.084 --> 01:07:50.042
We will get out of here.

928
01:07:50.042 --> 01:07:55.042
Steve? Grant, do you ever get the feeling
that maybe Steve Lockwood is just a

929
01:07:55.042 --> 01:07:58.000
monkey? Why would you say that about him?

930
01:07:58.042 --> 01:08:03.042
Earl, why would you ever say that?!

931
01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:05.042
Of course he's just a monkey.
How stupid are you people?

932
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
No one should ever put
any trust in a monkey.

933
01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:11.042
Chester thinks you're a monkey.

934
01:08:11.042 --> 01:08:12.000
Well, I'm an ape.

935
01:08:12.042 --> 01:08:13.042
Chester knows that.

936
01:08:13.042 --> 01:08:16.042
But he calls you a monkey.

937
01:08:17.084 --> 01:08:18.000
Ooh!

938
01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:19.000
It is true.

939
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
He does.
He's just joking around.

940
01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.000
Chester's my best friend.

941
01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:30.000
If Chester was really your friend,
would he still call you a monkey?

942
01:09:11.084 --> 01:09:12.000
Flint!

943
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Dad. What's happening, son?
You look terrible.

944
01:09:18.084 --> 01:09:19.042
What's with all of them?

945
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.042
They saved my life.

946
01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:27.000
I let Chester steal the machine and now
he's starting operation slice and dice.

947
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Come on, son. You're really
not making any sense.

948
01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:33.042
Look, Chester's gonna wipe
out all the food-imals.

949
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.084
My friends tried to tell me they
were good, but I didn't listen.

950
01:09:39.084 --> 01:09:42.000
Everything I touch just gets ruined.

951
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.542
Barry?
Barry.

952
01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:50.000
I'm so sorry I misjudged you.

953
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.042
I should have listened to Sam.

954
01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:53.084
What is it, Barry?

955
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.042
What are you trying to say?

956
01:09:58.042 --> 01:10:04.042
Uh-huh. Saa, saa, sasspah.

957
01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:06.000
Sassy pants. Dad? Dada, Dada!

958
01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:11.000
Sam and the gang? Uh-huh, uh-huh.

959
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.084
Oh, oh, it looks like a, uh,
a, uh, a sentinel of safety.

960
01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:19.042
Dada, Dada, Dada, Dada.

961
01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:20.000
Ah, sassy pants.

962
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Sassy pants? No, Dad.

963
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.042
He's saying sentinels captured
Sam and the gang.

964
01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:46.000
Nubba, nubba.

965
01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:56.084
He nubba, nubba.

966
01:10:56.084 --> 01:10:57.042
Hey, mom! Come here! Good, G-Spider?

967
01:10:57.042 --> 01:11:03.042
Uh, sasspah.

968
01:11:08.084 --> 01:11:12.000
Got it, Barry. Diba, diba, booba,
dee, bop, ba, dooba, dee.

969
01:11:12.084 --> 01:11:13.084
Thanks, G-Spider.

970
01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:23.084
Barry, use the grocery deliverator
to save your friends.

971
01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.042
I'll go save mine.

972
01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:58.000
Hey, freeze!

973
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:05.084
Fine. Oh, that hurt.

974
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Oh! Why?

975
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Oh, I was just up. Oh!

976
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:17.500
Ah! Oh!

977
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.042
Ah! Oh! Lockwood?
You still alive?

978
01:12:57.042 --> 01:12:59.042
That's right. Hands up!

979
01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.042
Give me back my friends.

980
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.042
Of course! No, it's not.

981
01:13:02.042 --> 01:13:03.042
I'm ready. I don't have the help.

982
01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:07.000
Hey, friends.

983
01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:08.042
Sam! Guys!

984
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.042
Chester, let them go.

985
01:13:10.084 --> 01:13:12.000
Oh, don't worry, Lockwood.

986
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.042
I'll let them go. Oh, dude.
I can see them coming.

987
01:13:18.042 --> 01:13:18.542
Oh, whoa.

988
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:20.500
Food bars?

989
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
You're going to turn them into food bars?

990
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.042
Yes.
Food bars. The lifeblood of my company.

991
01:13:27.042 --> 01:13:28.042
You are out of the action.

992
01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:30.084
You look always delicious.

993
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.042
And like always delicious. You up-cut.

994
01:13:32.042 --> 01:13:37.000
You over-dense. You over-dense.

995
01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:38.042
You always come.

996
01:13:39.084 --> 01:13:42.000
Always. Hit the ground.

997
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:59.042
It's on the bottom. You pluck.

998
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.084
You pluck it. Oh, better than that, you're
a better person than the way I live.

999
01:14:01.084 --> 01:14:02.000
I can't do this.

1000
01:14:02.042 --> 01:14:04.042
Hey, you're not the
way the world is up to.

1001
01:14:04.084 --> 01:14:09.000
You have to tell me about that.

1002
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
You're a terrible guy.

1003
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.042
You ruined it. You win, right?

1004
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.500
You owe it.

1005
01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:40.000
I love my gosh, you're a professional.
Oh, you got the acumen.

1006
01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:50.042
You owe this to a button.

1007
01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:52.042
Oh, whatever, whatever. I
can do this. Oh, we're dying.

1008
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.042
Boom. Okay.

1009
01:14:55.084 --> 01:15:00.000
You are dismissed.

1010
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Ooh, we did it.

1011
01:15:09.042 --> 01:15:13.042
Yes. You're

1012
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
out. Come on, Fire away this.

1013
01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:18.000
I'm a bit jealous. Oh, well, I'm better.

1014
01:16:21.084 --> 01:16:22.042
Party's over.

1015
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
I think it's time to celebrate.

1016
01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:55.042
Thanks, lab partner.

1017
01:16:55.042 --> 01:16:55.542
Help me.

1018
01:16:58.084 --> 01:17:03.084
I'm so sorry for being such a.

1019
01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:06.000
Okay, I guess I deserve that.

1020
01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:19.042
I don't like a sock.

1021
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.042
I'm out.

1022
01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:41.084
One drop of my venom
can kill a hundred men.

1023
01:17:43.042 --> 01:17:43.542
So.

1024
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
It's over Chester.

1025
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.042
Now hand over the flits.

1026
01:17:50.042 --> 01:17:53.000
No, never.

1027
01:18:22.042 --> 01:18:23.042
Oh, shot.

1028
01:18:29.042 --> 01:18:31.084
Oh, I'd so we sell.

1029
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Oh, that will leave a
bad taste in your mouth.

1030
01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:46.000
Oh Oh Oh.

1031
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:10.500
Go right ahead, dear. Guys!

1032
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Do you think we can still work together?

1033
01:20:15.042 --> 01:20:18.042
I think we will work great together.

1034
01:20:22.042 --> 01:20:25.000
Come on, bring it on in, Barb.

1035
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Ah, this is nice.

1036
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:48.500
Ape! Monkey.

1037
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
I'm proud of you, son.

1038
01:20:51.042 --> 01:20:52.000
Thanks, Dad.

1039
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But there's one last thing I need to do.

1040
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.042
Have your lunch for the train.

1041
01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:57.000
Si.

1042
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.084
Sweater if it gets cold.

1043
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.042
For the millionth time, Si.

1044
01:21:01.042 --> 01:21:02.042
I love you too, Papa.

1045
01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:06.042
Ah, sanse mozzarella.

1046
01:21:06.042 --> 01:21:07.000
We did it.

1047
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.084
Well, Julia, can't wait
to race next summer.

1048
01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:12.084
Or we could just have fun.

1049
01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:15.042
Ciao, Julia.

1050
01:21:18.042 --> 01:21:19.042
Ciao, regazzi.

1051
01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:29.000
A presto. Well, let's
go fix up our Vespa.

1052
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Yeah, about that.

1053
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.042
Crazy thing. I might have sold it.

1054
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:37.500
Luca?

1055
01:21:38.042 --> 01:21:38.542
Mom?

1056
01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:40.042
What are you all doing here?

1057
01:21:42.042 --> 01:21:48.000
If you promise to write to us every
single day and be as safe as possible,

1058
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
and I mean safer than safe,
you can go to school.

1059
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:54.500
I can?

1060
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.042
It's all arranged, actually.

1061
01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.084
You'd stay with Julia and her mom.

1062
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.042
Your friend talked them into it.

1063
01:22:00.084 --> 01:22:02.000
It wasn't easy.

1064
01:22:04.042 --> 01:22:06.000
Luca, do you promise?

1065
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.042
Yes, yes, I promise.

1066
01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:15.042
Thank you. Just remember, we
are always here for you, okay?

1067
01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:18.042
Hey, look me in the eye.

1068
01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:21.042
You know I love you, right?

1069
01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:29.042
I know. Come on, Alberto.

1070
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The train's gonna leave.

1071
01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:39.084
And that's when I discovered
law enforcement.

1072
01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:42.042
I'm proud of you, Will.

1073
01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:46.042
Dad, come on.

1074
01:27:12.042 --> 01:27:13.000
Oh, what?

1075
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:24.084
You're not off! I'm not gonna do it!
