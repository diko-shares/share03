{2697}{2810}Look. This is a big claim. The cops|want to nail the guywho stole it too.
{2812}{2882}The difference is we have to make good|the 30, 000 bucks. They don't.
{2884}{2930}To them it's another heist.
{2932}{2997}Or, has the owner stashed it|away someplace,
{2998}{3066}and is she trying to defraud us|out ofa lot ofmoney?
{3068}{3129}Ifyou have large sums|of cash around the house,
{3131}{3213}wewould insist on certain|alarm and security precautions,
{3214}{3272}which my supervisor|would have to approve.

{3574}{3676}Let me have a cherry cheesecake, a prune|danish and a couple of Hershey bars.

{3810}{3877}I-- It's at Galaxy Opticals.
{3879}{3926}They cut the thing out ofthe frame.
{3928}{3977}They rolled the canvas up,|and it's in one ofthe telescopes.
{3978}{4044}- How'd you figure it out?|- It wasn't easy.
{4046}{4119}I'm supposed to be looking|for a picture ofa woman with a guitar.
{4121}{4221}But it's all little cubes.|It took me two hours to find the nose.
{4223}{4297}- You should call the cops.|- Yeah, right away.
{4300}{4349}Would you excuse me?
{4352}{4446}Rosie, would you get me the fingerprints|on the Leland claim?
{4449}{4529}- Whowon the sixth race at Aqueduct?|- Your horse came in seventh.
{4531}{4603}Seventh? Never bet on a horse|who has Parkinson's.

{5522}{5569}- Why?|- They're streamlining.
{5570}{5657}- This is Fitzgerald?|- Who else?
{5945}{6016}Did you take the files|out of my office?
{6018}{6086}Would you like to go out and try|coming back in like a human being?
{6088}{6184}- Did you move my files?|- Ifyou don't like the human|idea, come in like an orangutan.
{6186}{6285}- That would be a step up too.|- Put them back... now-- this instant.
{6287}{6335}You knew we were|rearranging this floor.
{6337}{6442}Take my files--|Put them back in my office now.
{6443}{6495}You had plenty oftime|to transfer them yourself.
{6497}{6564}Fitzgerald, ifyou were a man,|I would slam you in the teeth.
{6566}{6642}IfI was a man,|you'd be hiding underthe desk.
{6644}{6733}- This is whatyou do|when I giveyou an order?|- Give me an order? You?
{6735}{6791}Who doyou think I am,|some peroxide little stenographer...
{6793}{6853}with her brains in her sweater|whose rear end you pinch?
{6856}{6915}Pinch it?|I couldn't get my arms around it.
{6918}{6977}I don't take orders from you.|I work directlyfor Mr. Magruder.

{7561}{7632}Ifyou don't get off my toe,|you're going to be singing|castrati with a glee club.
{7635}{7727}I... hated you, Fitzgerald, from|the dayyou set foot into this office.
{7729}{7785}You'd hate anywoman who doesn't have|a double-digit I. Q
{7786}{7833}I'm a good judge of character.
{7834}{7917}I hateyou, and I hate the chancellor|ofGermany...
{7918}{7975}with the little mustache,|but not in that order.
{7977}{8023}Be careful when you leave.
{8025}{8081}Don't let the door hityou on the back|and fractureyour pelvis.
{8122}{8174}So, didyou tell her who's boss?
{8176}{8223}Is she kiddin',|talkin' to me like that?
{8225}{8272}It's 'cause she thinks she's smarter.
{8275}{8361}'Cause she graduated from Vassar,|and I went to driving school.
{8364}{8448}Does she have any idea|how many cases I cracked here?
{8450}{8502}Never trust a woman who|whistles for her own cabs.
{8504}{8550}[Boy]|Excuse me. Miss Fitzgerald?
{8552}{8609}- Is that Miss Fitzgerald's lunch?|- Mm-hmm.
{8611}{8681}- Sorry we're so late. We're jammed up.|- That's okay.
{8682}{8740}- Here. Keep that. It's foryou.|- Thanks.
{8742}{8799}This is Fitzgerald's lunch.|She's been waiting a long time for it.
{8801}{8848}I'll deliver it to her.
{8850}{8917}You got to come to some terms with this|woman. This thing is only gettin' worse.
{8918}{8991}What dowe need an efficiency expert|here for?
{8993}{9050}When the old man was here,|this never could have happened.
{9052}{9109}Thoughtyou were gonna take her out|for a drink, clearthe air.
{9112}{9191}I did. I took hertwo weeks ago|to Rocky's Bar.

{9486}{9625}- Sorry I'm late.|- No problem. It's just|an hour and 15 minutes.

{9731}{9823}We're revamping the offices, getting rid|ofthat antiquated filing system.
{9825}{9920}Yes? I can find anything I need.
{9922}{10013}I can locate it like that. I got a feel|forwhere all the stuffis in my office.
{10014}{10111}We're making a central data file on the|second floor. You'll get used to it.
{10113}{10170}What's the matter?|You look flushed.
{10172}{10248}No, I'm just--|I'm just a little warm. That's all.
{10250}{10310}You have all your|business meetings here?
{10313}{10440}It's near the office. The coat check|girl's pretty. Don'tyou like it?
{10442}{10555}No, it's fine. Gives new meaning|to the word "dive, " but it's convenient.
{10557}{10684}I- I thoughtyou'd appreciate|the thick smoke. You don't|have to put on as much makeup.
{10686}{10748}- [Man] What's the ladyhavin'?|- Tequila.

{10806}{10857}So, um--

{10966}{11040}Um, c-can-- s-should I call you--
{11042}{11136}I can call you Miss Fitzgerald,|which is fine with me.|I have no problem with that.
{11139}{11230}I-- I--|Tell me aboutyourself.
{11232}{11331}- Myself?|- Your hopes, your dreams, you know.
{11333}{11410}You married?|I mean, obviouslyyou're not married,
{11412}{11506}'cause then it would not be Miss|Fitzgerald, soyou have a boyfriend?
{11507}{11562}Is this whyyou got me here?
{11564}{11643}I just, um-- So--
{11645}{11730}What is your life like?|I mean, doyou have any hobbies?
{11732}{11829}- I have a meeting in 15 minutes, so--|- I-I-I-I--
{11830}{11896}Not-- I didn't mean to ask|aboutyour marital status.
{11898}{11989}That's none of my business. Maybe|you're-- It's a touchy point with you.
{11990}{12057}You're possibly divorced orwidowed.
{12058}{12149}Maybeyour husband committed suicide.|I could understand that.
{12151}{12258}Mr. Magruder hired me to streamline|the office, and I'm going to.
{12259}{12374}But ifsomething is not broken, you know|what I say? I say, whyfix it?
{12376}{12453}There's a reason North Coast has slipped|from the top five insurance companies.
{12455}{12518}There's an enormous amount|ofwaste and duplication.
{12520}{12569}Yeah, not-- not in my department.
{12570}{12645}There's not a single department|that couldn't be run more|efficiently or economically.
{12646}{12721}I'm not even sure North Coast|wouldn't be better off not carrying...
{12723}{12797}an investigative division and just|farming out each case privately.
{12838}{12917}[ Stammers ]
{12919}{13042}Would it be possible to meet at some|point and have a drinkand discuss that?
{13044}{13110}- We are having a drink.|- [ Exhales ]
{13112}{13174}Look, I don't thinkyou know|whatyou're talking about.
{13176}{13234}I thinkyou came in here|like a steamroller--
{13236}{13307}You felt threatened by me|from the first day I got on this job.
{13309}{13414}Not onlywas I an efficiency|expert and a challenge toyour|little statewithin a state,
{13416}{13489}but I'm not one ofthosewindup dolls|you can tickle at thewater cooler.
{13491}{13550}I'm smarterthan you. I'm faster.
{13553}{13624}I can see right through you.|You're right to feel threatened by me.
{13627}{13730}I... am threatened byyou?
{13732}{13860}It's fascinating, as a female|executive, how many men I meet|with a fragile masculinity.
{13862}{13909}A fragile masculinity?
{13911}{13990}You make one more crackabout|my religion, and woman or nowoman--
{13992}{14098}- I have to go.|- Hey, listen, honey,|let me level with you here.
{14099}{14185}Despite all your highfalutin talk|about streamlining the office,
{14187}{14273}whatyou really need is|a good old-fashioned roll in the hay.
{14276}{14329}Ha! You wouldn't know|which end is up.
{14331}{14402}Well, in your case,|itwould be hard to tell.
{14403}{14462}Don't bother seeing me to the door.|Someone might thinkwe're together.
{14465}{14560}- Why? Do I look like an organ grinder?|- No, just an organ.
{14562}{14633}- So the drink didn't smooth things out.|- No, not exactly.
{14635}{14684}You better get used to her,|'cause she's here to stay.
{14686}{14786}There's something about that broad that|I don't trust. She's got an evil streak.
{14788}{14880}We got a reservation for 8:00|at the Rainbow Room for George's 50th.
{14882}{14930}That'll be fun.|We'llsplit a cab uptown.

{15057}{15159}Sweetheart, no matter how bad|the economy gets, you will never starve.
{15161}{15207}Good.
{15248}{15349}Oh, wait. Come here.|Miss Fitzgerald? Okay, take a card.
{15350}{15416}You gotta see this, Fitz.

{15792}{15843}Not really.|I'm up to my neck in work.
{15845}{15897}Why don'tyou come?|It'll be fun. George is a great guy.
{15899}{15958}Most ofthe personnel|here seems very nice.
{15959}{16029}The only one that gives me|the dry heaves is Briggs.
{16030}{16107}C. W.? He's crackeda lot ofcases.
{16109}{16171}Ofcourse, I don'tsee how.|Such a drone.
{16173}{16276}Gets his tips from street contacts|like ex-cons and blind beggars.
{16278}{16333}There's something about him|I don't trust.
{16335}{16385}- Any examples?|- Many.
{16387}{16473}He's smarmywith those office wisecracks|and double-meaning jokes.
{16474}{16522}I mean, who is he, really?
{16524}{16645}He's this shallow,|skirt- chasing egomaniac who's|probably more lucky than good.
{16647}{16737}Sometimes it's betterto be lucky.|I thinkyou're being too rough on him.
{16739}{16817}It's more that he's just|kind ofa schnookwho's more|insecure than anything else.

{17296}{17360}I'll be free by the end oftheyear,|and then we can be together openly.

{26154}{26240}- I told you this would not work.|- Well, I tried my best.
{26242}{26332}Come on, George. Back me up.|Briggsie, I'm tellin' ya.
{26334}{26389}You gazed deeply into her eyes|and told heryou loved her.
{26391}{26463}You're crazy.|I wouldnever dosuch a thing.
{26465}{26521}This is a conspiracy|to make me appear crazy.
{26523}{26582}I hope somebody talks to me|like that someday.
{26585}{26632}I can't bear Fitzgerald.
{26634}{26752}Speaking ofthat, isn't it-- Should we|be getting home to, uh, feed your cat?
{26754}{26829}Thatwould be fun,|but I'm getting a cold,
{26831}{26898}so I justwant to get to bed|with some tea, you know?
{26900}{26988}Ifyou've got a cold, somebody's|got to rubyour chest down with Vicks.
{26990}{27053}- This is what I'm for.|- Anybody rubs my chest down|better bring a ring.
{27055}{27102}Good foryou.
{27227}{27289}- Good night, baby.|- Good night, Chris.
{27290}{27376}I knew we'd get a little time|alone tonight ifyou came along.
{27378}{27425}I'm glad I came.

{28741}{28803}You are in a deep trance.
{28805}{28903}You will fall deeper and deeper|underthe sway ofmywords.
{28905}{28983}You will obey|my instructions carefully.
{28986}{29045}You will proceed to|the Kensington estate...
{29047}{29166}whereyou will obtain thejewels-- all|thejewels-- from the Kensington safe.
{29167}{29233}You will do this|with the utmost secrecy,
{29234}{29325}using all the information|and techniques atyour command.
{29326}{29393}You'll do itwith|great ease and facility.
{29395}{29495}Then you will return toyour apartment,|taking thejewels with you.
{29497}{29579}You'll hide them in|a safe and secure hiding place,
{29581}{29651}awaiting further instructions from me.
{29653}{29737}You will then fall into a deep slumber|from which you will awake refreshed,
{29740}{29826}and you'll have no memory|ofanything that has occurred.
{29829}{29885}You will wait to hearfrom me again.
{29886}{30006}Your lifewill be simply as|your life is until you hearfrom me.
{30008}{30084}Remember. You will obey|my instructions to the letter.
{30086}{30168}You will remember absolutely nothing|that occurred undertrance.
{30170}{30221}Is that cleartoyou?
{30223}{30270}Very clear.
{30271}{30367}Go. TheJade Scorpion commands it.
{30773}{30827}Awfully late, Mr. Briggs.
{30829}{30875}Hot on a case, eh?
{31905}{31961}The Kensingtonsafe|was broken into last night.
{31962}{32048}Somebody got on the estate.|Jewels worth millions, all gone.
{32050}{32129}The cops don't have a clue,|and Magruder is numb.
{32130}{32225}I don't understand.|I made that place burglarproofmyself.
{32226}{32276}Well, tell that to the perpetrator.
{32278}{32382}We are on the hook for big money here,|soyou better get over there darn fast.
{32384}{32524}By now those stones could be|on the market in Tangier or-- or Cairo.
{32526}{32643}Everything, everything--|My emerald tiara and my sapphire|necklace from India--
{32645}{32709}That sapphire is the most|perfect in theworld.
{32710}{32772}No fingerprints,|butwe got a partial shoe print.
{32774}{32828}- Man orwoman?|- I really can't be sure.
{32830}{32900}I want to interview everybody|that works here-- the whole staff--
{32902}{32957}the butlers, the gardeners, everybody.
{32959}{33052}- Something's goin' on.|- This time I thinkyour gut|reaction is betraying you.
{33054}{33125}Nobody in this house is involved.|I'd bet my life.
{33127}{33191}I want to search the up--|I want to go up-- Can I go upstairs?
{33193}{33249}Ifyou must,|butwould you make it fast?
{33251}{33298}We've had enough excitement|for one day.
{33300}{33387}Mrs. Kensington, you know|Alfie and I would never--
{33389}{33441}Lotte, of course not.
{33701}{33783}What areyou doin'|in my mother's closet?
{33786}{33832}Well, hello.
{33878}{33978}You're one ofthose grubby little|private detectives, aren'tyou?
{33980}{34097}A private eye, they're called,|a shamus, a gumshoe.
{34098}{34185}Oh, I'm-- I'm a grubby little|insurance investigator.
{34187}{34268}The private eyes are romantic.|I- I-I'm just grubby.
{34270}{34341}Sowhat? You always getyour kicks|fondling women's shoes?
{34342}{34402}Once in a while I'll fondle|thewholewoman, you know--
{34404}{34485}Hmph. You have a fresh mouth.|I'm not sure I likeyou.
{34487}{34613}Well, I tend to grow on people.|We could meet later, and I could|grow on you, ifyou like.
{34615}{34681}You don't seem tough enough|to go after criminals.
{34683}{34753}Really? Maybe ifI slapped you around|a little bit, you'd changeyour mind.
{34755}{34865}- I could slapyou back.|- It's starting to sound like fun.|Should we put some music on?
{34866}{34971}- Why areyou snooping around?|- You're Laura Kensington, right?
{34973}{35095}Yeah, that's right, and I have a|strawberry mark on mythigh to prove it.
{35097}{35193}- Would you like to see it?|- Maybe laterwhen|I can take the full tour.
{35195}{35277}Huh. My fiance|might not appreciate that.
{35278}{35381}- Yes? Which one?|- Oh, so you follow my life.
{35382}{35441}Well, I read the tabloids,|ifthat's whatyou mean.
{35442}{35513}So you've seen photos of me|diving into public fountains.
{35514}{35625}And getting arrested for speeding|and throwing champagne at El Morocco.
{35626}{35744}And while I'm out living the|fast life, you're hard atwork|snooping in people's closets.
{35746}{35806}Can I help it ifthey|pay me bythe clue?
{35808}{35925}- Did the burglar leave any?|- He didn't leave any|because he's still among us.
{35926}{36038}- Says who?|- Says the little man|that lives inside me.
{36041}{36120}Soyou're C. W. Briggs.
{36122}{36216}I hearyou're a very sharp investigator|with an impressive record.
{36219}{36266}I looked forward to meeting you.
{36268}{36376}- TheysayI always get myman.|- Me too.
{36378}{36445}[ Exhales ]|Right.
{36446}{36539}I'm glad we could|have this little chat.
{36541}{36624}- Too bad there's a houseful of people.|- Whereshall we go tonight?
{36626}{36702}Hmm? Chinatown or Harlem?
{36704}{36775}You preferjazz or opium?
{36777}{36857}Ipreferthe rug|in front ofmyfireplace.
{36859}{36961}Oh, directly to your apartment, eh?|You always begin with the dessert?
{36963}{37041}Well, depends what I'm eating.
{37043}{37159}This will be a very interesting|experiment for me.
{37161}{37268}I usually prefer more attractive,|athletic, muscular men.
{37270}{37363}Maybe I could get in a few|push- ups beforeyou came over.
{37365}{37431}I-- [ Clears Throat]|What aboutyour fiance?
{37433}{37521}Ifyou don't invite him, I won't.
{37666}{37737}- Any leads?|- It's an inside job.|No question about it.
{37738}{37814}- That's not what the cops say.|- They're wrong. It's inside. I can tell.
{37816}{37867}- Are the Giants playing this afternoon?|- Yeah.
{37869}{37933}They're playing|the Cardinals in St. Louis.
{37934}{38028}Call my bookmaker Frankie. I want to get|a bet down. Hundred bucks on the Giants.
{38030}{38082}- On the Giants towin.|- Towin, naturally!
{38084}{38131}What doyou think, to place?
{38134}{38209}Mr. Magruder? Oh, tilt.
{38210}{38270}- Anything on the Kensington situation?|- It's an insidejob.
{38272}{38368}- I bet my life on it.|- You betyour life on the Giants,|too, and they're in sixth place.
{38370}{38421}Can we talkwithout|thewarden being here?
{38423}{38487}Please, Miss Fitzgerald|is a part ofthis company now.
{38490}{38553}We must all learn to|worktogether in harmony.
{38555}{38614}What makes you so positive|it's an insidejob?
{38616}{38681}It couldn't be that smooth|unless itwas inside.
{38683}{38749}Miss Fitzgerald is suggesting,|given the magnitude ofthe loss,
{38750}{38805}thatwe expand our investigation.
{38806}{38905}- Meaning what?|- I appreciate thevalue|ofintuition to a point.
{38907}{38977}Butwe're moving into a decade|ofscientific innovation.
{38979}{39078}Miss Fitzgerald has suggested|that perhaps we might|getyou a little help...
{39080}{39164}byfarming out part ofthework|to an outside private detective agency.
{39166}{39244}- What?|- To helpyou-- test the waters--
{39246}{39316}see ifa newapproach|andfresh techniques make a difference.
{39318}{39364}Don't feel threatened immediately.
{39366}{39432}According to you, I'm only threatened|bywomen with high I. Qs.
{39434}{39480}Did you hire a female detective?
{39482}{39545}North Coast has got to get|with the progress ofthe marketplace.
{39546}{39596}There's a lot ofmoney at stake here.
{39598}{39651}The more time passes, the colder|the trail grows. You know that.
{39653}{39733}So ifthe Coopersmith Private Detective|Agency makes a contribution, then fine.
{39735}{39783}If not, we're only out a few bucks.
{39785}{39854}The Coopersmiths?|Those guys are like Fric and Frac.
{39856}{39943}- They're sub-mental.|- We are moving into|a new decade, the 1940s.
{39945}{39992}That means things are different.
{39994}{40067}Do me a favor. Max Baer's|looking for sparring partners.
{40070}{40117}Why don'tyou go down to the gym?
{40119}{40180}You're the only person I've received|this kind ofbitter resistance from.
{40183}{40309}You're a dinosaurwith your streetways|and disorganized hunt-and-peck methods.
{40311}{40385}Please. Myfather|always stressed harmony.

{40540}{40600}Watch out for the traffic.
{40602}{40701}Don't get hit by a bus,|your body mangled beyond recognition.

{41092}{41164}Fifty? You must be desperate.
{41166}{41301}You know where to reach me. Keep eating|the carrots. I think they're workin'.
{41433}{41494}I thinkJoe said they're|all gone up there, Mr. Briggs.

{42520}{42595}I'm working up here alone.|I'm filling out some reports.
{42597}{42680}What areyou gonna do, ask Magruder|to take out all thewater coolers?
{42682}{42751}Why don'tyou makeyourwisecracks|somewhere else? I'm busy.
{42753}{42829}I'm outta here.|You know, I-I-- Don't work too late,

{43996}{44050}Really? What'd you do, have|your father buy the building?
{44052}{44124}A small tip to the super|was all it took.
{44127}{44219}Foryou maybe. I give the super|a small tip, he spits on my shoes.
{44221}{44339}I brought somevery expensive|Russian vodka, 120 proof.
{44341}{44412}Don't drop that, you know.|You're liable to blow up the building.
{44414}{44527}I got bored waiting. There's|nothing to read but detective|magazines and the racing form.
{44529}{44613}I got a deck ofplaying cards with naked|women on them. You could've, you know--
{44615}{44711}Let me guess.|You use it to play solitaire.
{44714}{44773}I used to date the six ofspades.

{77885}{77943}Because while I thinkyou're|a mealy-mouthed little...
{77945}{78019}- Reptile.|- reptile-- thankyou--|I don't thinkyou're a jewel thief.
{78021}{78089}- What makes you so positive?|- It's too daring foryou.
{78092}{78169}You're not romantic enough.|It requires flairandimagination.
{78171}{78225}Myinstinct's telling me|you're not the one.
{78227}{78288}- I didn't thinkyou had instincts.|- I have them.
{78290}{78361}I don't usually trust them, especially|when it comes to sizing up men,
{78362}{78409}but this time I can feel it.
{78411}{78485}You're good atweasellytype things,|like snooping and spying.
{78487}{78538}You're not man enough|to be a cat burglar.
{78540}{78629}- You sound likeyou're attracted|to men who break the law.|- We're not here to discuss me.
{78630}{78721}We're here to talk aboutwhat Laura|Kensington told the Coopersmiths.
{78722}{78772}Laura Kensington wasn't here.
{78774}{78848}She-- You're making--|Laura Kensington was not here.
{78849}{78921}She said she left her stocking here.
{78923}{78981}Hey, that couldbe anybody's.|I don't know--
{78982}{79031}A lot ofwomen pass|through this apartment.
{79033}{79100}I'm not saying they're all winners,|but there's a lot ofaction here.
{79101}{79160}I 'm sure you're not overly particular.
{79161}{79224}Look. What do you want from me?|[Stammering]
{79226}{79339}I happen to enjoy the proximity|of a well-proportioned member|ofthe opposite sex.
{79341}{79448}That's how God created us,|and why should I be the one|to quibble with His concept?
{79449}{79529}I came to tell you a case is building|againstyou. Be honestwith me!
{79530}{79588}- I'm honest. I'm honest.|- Where did you get this stocking?
{79589}{79636}It's some broad's.
{79637}{79709}The women that are here, they lose|an earring, a stocking, I don't know.
{79711}{79777}Laura Kensington says it's hers.|She also says she tipped the super.
{79779}{79858}He let her in here,|and that story checks out.
{79860}{79925}- Whoever that is, I'm not here.|- What? Wh--
{79976}{80036}- Who is it?|- It's Herb andJoe C. oopersmith.
{80037}{80085}I don't want to be seen here!
{80086}{80137}Why? What's the problem?|What am I, a leper?
{80139}{80200}You're under suspicion.|I would have a lot of explaining to do.
{80201}{80258}You know, I thinkyou're still hooked|on Magruder.
{80260}{80320}That's whyyou don't--|Go down the end ofthe hall.
{80322}{80369}There's a bedroom.|Shut the door. Go in the bedroom.
{80370}{80441}Can I sit down in there,|orwill I catch something?
{80442}{80513}Germs can't live in your bloodstream.|It's too cold.
{80672}{80725}[Herb]|Let's go, C. W. Open up.
{80726}{80774}Coming!
{80988}{81043}Hey, fellas.|You sureyou got the right apartment?
{81045}{81109}The traps with the cheese|are in the basement.
{81110}{81165}- Can we come in?|- Now, wait a minute.
{81167}{81253}I got a chorus girl in the back room,|and ifI don't hurry up--
{81255}{81313}Wouldn't be Laura Kensington,|would it?
{81316}{81363}Laura Kensington?|I don't know.
{81365}{81419}They all look the same upside down.|I can nevertell.
{81421}{81469}She says shewas here|the other night,
{81472}{81556}till you dumped herto go out on|mysterious middle-of-the-night business.
{81558}{81639}Hey, would I dump Laura Kensington?|I eatWheaties.
{81641}{81766}Problem is, Eddie, the night guard from|the North Coast building, says you, uh,
{81768}{81845}made some strange middle-of-the-night|visits toyour office...
{81846}{81899}both nights the robberies took place.
{81901}{81954}Fellas, I'd love to chat|with you, but, you know,
{81956}{82010}there's a nurse in|the other room there, and--
{82012}{82060}I thoughtyou said|shewas a chorus girl.
{82061}{82122}Who does a little nursing?|Give me a break.
{82125}{82193}Come on. We can discuss this|tomorrow, can't we?
{82194}{82267}I don't know howyou can still make love|with this on your mind.
{82269}{82315}You know, you're facing|a long jail sentence.
{82317}{82383}That's exactlywhy I gotta|get in all I can now.
{82385}{82456}Yeah? Well, we're gonna turn this over|to the police tomorrow.
{82457}{82542}You can see. There's a case developing|that's pretty incriminating.
{82544}{82597}This is circumstantial evidence.|That's all you got.
{82598}{82687}Many a man's gone to the gallows|on circumstantial evidence.
{82689}{82735}Well, fellas, the gallows|are gonna have towait,
{82737}{82805}because I got a cocktail waitress|in the other room now, and I--
{82807}{82871}- Cocktail waitress?|- Yeah, a nurse, you know,
{82873}{82933}who-- who's a little bit|of a chorus girl,
{82934}{82981}and she works a lounge now and then.
{82984}{83031}Ifyou catch thejewel thief,|let me know.
{83033}{83082}- I'll getyou both newyo-yos.|- Yeah.
{83165}{83211}They're--
{83261}{83321}- What is this?|- I was...
{83322}{83369}browsing through your bookshelf,
{83370}{83480}and I found this deck|ofnaked playing cards and these.
{83481}{83528}This is-- What doyou--
{83529}{83575}This is-- This is|the Kensington jewels.
{83577}{83659}This is the-- This is|the Dillworth jewels and the-- the--
{83661}{83708}This is--|What areyou--
{83748}{83794}What areyou looking|at me like that for?
{83796}{83897}Becauseyou found them in amongst|my collection offemale art studies?
{83898}{83945}What is the implication here?
{83946}{83993}I used to gowith the six ofspades.
{83994}{84059}Then the four ofdiamonds|caught us together and therewas a--
{84061}{84143}I was aware thatyou sneaked up|mysteriouslyto the office|in the middle ofthe night...
{84145}{84191}and the lobby guard sawyou.
{84193}{84251}I knowyou have Laura Kensington's|stocking, and she swears...
{84253}{84340}you kicked her out ofbed to|take care ofsudden business,|which your super corroborates.
{84342}{84411}They have a footprint,|a matchbookwith your fingerprint,
{84413}{84496}and still I believed|thatyou didn't do it.
{84498}{84605}But now the actual stolen property|turns up hidden in your bedroom.
{84607}{84668}Sowhat areyou saying?|This makes you suspicious ofme?
{84671}{84763}I was actually a bit touched thatyou|stayed up all nightwatching over me.
{84765}{84869}I began to think, " Maybe he's not the|scummy littlevermin he seems to be. "
{84871}{84948}I maybe ascummyvermin,|but I'm an honestscummy vermin.
{84949}{85011}- I didn't take these jewels.|- How can you deny it?
{85013}{85072}- You've been caught red-handed.|- Yes, I--
{85074}{85157}What-- I'm-- I grant you,|there's a fingerprint of me,
{85158}{85246}and they have a footprint,|and the jewels are in my bedroom.
{85248}{85294}This I giveyou.
{85297}{85385}- I'm starting to think|I'm in tremendous trouble here.|- I'm calling the police.
{85387}{85464}No. Will you forget about logic|and give me the benefit ofthe doubt?
{85465}{85525}- Ha! That makes me an accessory.|- Not ifI'm innocent.
{85528}{85579}You don't have a kosher bone|in your body.
{85581}{85668}That's exactlywhyyou getyourselves|into these problems.
{85669}{85729}That's why Magruder's|waiting foryou, right?
{85731}{85805}You make all thewrong decisions|'causeyou make 'em here, not here.
{85807}{85873}Decisions made here|are not as reliable as here,
{85874}{85936}because this is gray cells|and this is blood,
{85938}{85984}and blood circulates|through the body.
{85985}{86040}It gets around.|It knows what the score is.
{86041}{86111}But up here, gray cells|just laythere and think.
{86113}{86140}- You seewhat I'm saying?|- [Phone Rings]
{86141}{86213}- You seewhat I'm saying?|- [Phone Rings]
{86216}{86284}- Hello?|- Constantinople.
{86320}{86372}You will take thejewels,|each and every one ofthem.
{86373}{86373}You will take thejewels,|each and every one ofthem.
{86376}{86421}Make sureyou have them all.
{86423}{86517}Wrap them tightly in brown paper|so it's impossible for anyone|to tell what they are.
{86518}{86613}Go to Grand Central Station.|Rent a locker. Lock them in.
{86616}{86700}Go home, taking the keywith you,|and put the key in your mailbox.
{86703}{86763}Make sure to leave the mailbox open.
{86765}{86845}Then you will go into a deep,|refreshing slumber, and when you awake,
{86846}{86896}you will remember nothing|ofwhat has transpired.
{86898}{86955}Is that clear?
{87085}{87132}Miss Fitzgerald?
{87164}{87212}Have-- Have I ever told you...
{87249}{87326}thatyou're one ofthe most|beautiful women I've ever met?
{87353}{87416}- I'm turning you in.|- No, I mean it.
{87418}{87505}That's what made me first fall in love|withyou is those beautiful eyes.
{87508}{87581}I can't believe it. You're actually|trying to sweet-talk me?
{87583}{87642}I resisted because, well, down deep...
{87644}{87690}I thought thatyou might hurt me,
{87692}{87754}and I didn'twant to put myself|in that position again.
{87756}{87807}C. W., let me setyou straight|once and for all.
{87809}{87882}I wouldn't be interested in you|ifyou were the last man on Earth.
{87884}{87938}Not onlythat, I find it insulting|thatyou could think...
{87940}{87988}I would fall for such|a heavy-handed ploy.
{87989}{88040}What a low opinion|ofmeyou must have.
{88041}{88086}Thankyou for dropping by.
{88088}{88177}I'm a little busy right now,|but tomorrow night,|maybewe could have dinner.
{88179}{88225}I know a candlelight restaurant.
{88227}{88307}I could look intoyour eyes|and tell you how crazy aboutyou I am.
{88309}{88394}IfI didn't knowwhat a squirming|little trapped ratyou were,
{88396}{88442}I'd thinkyou had a brain tumor.
{88869}{88934}- You're late.|- God, I'm still trembling.
{88936}{88984}Over last night?|I couldn't sleep a wink.
{88986}{89041}It's not that, Chris. It's Briggs.
{89073}{89154}He's guilty, isn't he?|It's a sad story.
{89156}{89209}Please don't make me|go into all the details,
{89210}{89303}but I wonder ifhe's having some kind|ofmental breakdown.
{89305}{89364}He may be realizing|the consequences ofhis deeds.
{89366}{89433}- The Coopersmiths are closing in on him.|- Could he have...
{89434}{89481}a split personality?
{89482}{89568}A lot of criminals have been|known to play crafty games|when it suited their purposes.
{89569}{89640}I need a drink.
{89641}{89729}IfI tell you something, doyou promise|not to go offhalf-cocked?
{89731}{89803}Okay, but hurry.|I've got some big news.
{89805}{89852}- I found thejewels.|- What?
{90145}{90196}And keep me apprised, will you?|Thankyou.
{90274}{90329}The police are on theway, thank God.
{90331}{90377}It's an open-and-shut case.
{90379}{90449}Much as I cringe at the publicity,|I'm elated at the recovery.
{90450}{90532}It's clear there's|so much more to this, Chris.
{90533}{90628}Oh, I've seen men driven to extremes|before being around big money.
{90630}{90679}These guys earn their living exposing...
{90681}{90763}all kinds of exotic schemes|to defraud and rob people.
{90765}{90842}Sometimes they start thinking,|" Hey, I'm on the inside.|I knowwhythese schemes fail.
{90844}{90890}I won't make the same mistakes. "
{90892}{90977}You're saying he's cracked|from so manyyears ofhard work?
{90979}{91084}He's a driven man.|Had a terrible marital experience.
{91085}{91161}Turned him offwomen, except for|the little no-threat secretaries...
{91163}{91221}and barflies he picks up.
{91222}{91278}Crushed when he caught|his wife cheating.
{91280}{91326}He's feeling older|and looks around and says,
{91328}{91400}" Hey, maybe it's time|I get mine and get out. "
{91402}{91459}Guy named Peterson|a couple ofyears ago tried the same.
{91461}{91532}Of course, he's a houseguest|at Sing Sing these days.
{91533}{91610}Well, I'm sureyou know him|betterthan I do.
{91612}{91661}It'll resolve itself.
{91663}{91752}Um, Betty Ann, I spokewith Caroline.
{91790}{91864}- You did?|- I told her I wanted myfreedom.
{91909}{91970}- Really?|- Isn't that fabulous?
{91972}{92018}It's surprising.
{92020}{92066}I thoughtyou'd be|knocked offyourfeet.
{92068}{92141}Well, I mean, itwas last night.
{92143}{92202}- It's sort oflike a roller coaster.|- Forget about last night.
{92204}{92263}I knew I'd made a mistake|the minute I leftyour apartment.
{92265}{92315}What did she say?
{92317}{92384}I thinkshe sensed|we'd been drifting apart.
{92385}{92432}Shewas very poised.
{92433}{92496}Said ifI was sure|that's what I wanted, uh--
{92528}{92585}- Thankyou.|- I'll have another one ofthese, please.
{92586}{92639}Sure.
{92641}{92706}You're certainly not as euphoric|as I'd imagined.
{92708}{92810}Well, you can't expect me to just|change gears and turn on a dime.
{92841}{92889}- Haveyou changed your mind?|- Mmm.
{92923}{92990}- No.|- You haven't met someone else, haveyou?
{92993}{93040}No, no, I haven't.
{93263}{93350}I don't understand, fellas.|What-- What's going on? What'd I do?
{93352}{93444}Yes, those are the ones.|They were in his bookcase.
{93445}{93562}He bets every day, and, uh,|and he usually loses.
{93564}{93623}I knew he was into the bookmakers|for a bundle.
{93625}{93696}Look, I was with him on Tuesday night|till about 12:00.
{93697}{93794}Then suddenly he got a phone call|and hewas like a different man.
{93797}{93870}Ifitwas anyone else but C. W.,
{93873}{93940}wewouldn't even be discussing this.
{93941}{94007}Thejewels were in his locker.|It's an airtight case.
{94009}{94068}Listen, fellas,|I knowyouguys wantedmy job,
{94069}{94131}but I could get 30 years|up the river for this.
{94133}{94192}With good behavior,|you'll be out in 20.
{94194}{94244}- [ Laughing ]|- I'll getyou. No matterwhereyou are.
{94246}{94320}I'll check every low-I. Q club in town,|and I'll find you. I'll kill you.
{94321}{94381}- Low I. Q Some genius.|- I'll kill these guys.
{94383}{94441}- Take it easy.|- I'm not one to givepious lectures,
{94443}{94501}but ifyou needed money,|you could have come to me.
{94503}{94571}I would have listened.|I warned you aboutyour gambling habit.
{94573}{94626}Can'tyou see|what a conspiracythis is?
{94629}{94676}They plant a footprint|and a fingerprint,
{94678}{94729}and the nightwatchman|forges my signature.
{94732}{94825}It's easy. And this crazy girl|who smokes opium makes up a story.
{94827}{94875}And Fitzgerald plants|thejewels in my apartment.
{94877}{94944}There's a word for peoplewho think|everyone is conspiring against them.
{94945}{94994}- That's right. Perceptive.|- C. W.,
{94996}{95082}you triedtoswallowthe keyto|the lockerat Grand C. entral Station...
{95084}{95130}where we found the stolen goods.
{95132}{95188}- You got anywitnesses?|- Yeah, me!
{95189}{95243}You gonna take yourword over mine?
{95245}{95292}Let's get him over to the courthouse|and book him.
{95293}{95340}You better get a lawyer, C. W.
{95341}{95389}I'm shocked.|This is one ofmy best men.
{95390}{95449}You know how long I've known this guy?|Tommy, come with me.
{95450}{95516}Yeah, Mike, I'm right behind ya.|I'm sorry about this, C. W.
{95517}{95566}I'll make the arrangements.|Stick around.
{95989}{96040}Well, well, well.
{96041}{96098}Ifit isn't|Mr. Fast-Talkin' Investigator...
{96100}{96172}who got caught with his hand|in the cookie jar.
{96174}{96224}Did I reallythrowyou out ofbed?
{96227}{96305}Why? You planning on using|the insanity defense?
{96306}{96383}Listen, honey, I gotta get some help,|and you're gonna help me.
{96385}{96448}- Am I?|- Yes.
{96449}{96488}- And what makes you think that?|- This is your kind ofthing.
{96489}{96529}- And what makes you think that?|- This is your kind ofthing.
{96531}{96577}This'll look great on your resume.
{96579}{96678}A suspected felon, a daring escape from|police headquarters, broad daylight.
{96680}{96740}[Stammering]|Youlike this kindofthing.
{96742}{96790}Go over to that top drawer over there.
{96792}{96857}They took the handcuffs|outta the second drawer from the left.
{96858}{96906}- There's gotta be a keyin there.|- Nervous.
{96908}{96998}See ifthere's a key.|Go. Hurry up. C. ome on.

{98661}{98738}I'll be out ofthe house in twoweeks.|The divorcewill take longer.
{98740}{98802}That's whythe agreement|has to be securely in place.
{98804}{98882}Otherwise, it could get killed|ifwewere found together.
{98884}{98954}- Where areyou?|- Doyou think he's really guilty?
{98956}{99054}- Is thatwhatyou're thinking about?|- I can't shake this uneasyfeeling.
{99056}{99109}What? That he's innocent?|He was caught red-handed.
{99111}{99167}Believe me,|itjust doesn't feel right.
{99169}{99255}I don't see that snoopy little termite|as a romanticjewel thief.
{99257}{99310}Well, I'd hardly call|breaking the law romantic.
{99313}{99372}- [Phone Ringing]|- I didn't mean it thatway.

{99957}{100039}Okay. Yes, I certainlywill.
{100041}{100135}Ifyou had any doubts about his|culpability, this should allaythem.
{100137}{100197}- He escaped.|- He did?

{126817}{126899}But I figured it out.|That's why I get top dollar.

{126928}{127011}Don't force me to take|extreme measures, Mr. Briggs.
{127013}{127060}You'd never pull that trigger.
{127062}{127109}Really? You think not. Why?
{127112}{127193}Murder's notyour game. I have|just an instinct that tells me that.
{127195}{127242}You know, you're a jewel thief.
{127244}{127316}There's a big difference between doing|a little time for stealing jewels...

{130486}{130581}Between us boys, oncewe marry,|she's gonna retire|whether shewants to or not.
{130582}{130677}I'm not having a wife at work|in my own office, for good measure.

{132394}{132476}Today, Mr. Magruder.|Tomorrow, the world.

{132543}{132613}Mm. You're really gonna marry him?
{132615}{132661}I- I-- You know.
{132663}{132721}For a brilliant woman, I gotta say,
{132724}{132800}you have the worst taste in men.
{132802}{132873}I didn't take up with you.|How bad could mytaste be?

{133076}{133121}But don't ever let it come out,
{133123}{133197}because, you know, you could|run the risk ofbeing happy,
{133199}{133245}and I know that would kill ya.
{133247}{133295}Chris and I plan|on being very happy.
{133297}{133359}Your instinct told you|hewould never leave his wife.
{133361}{133434}My instincts are good,|but they're not infallible.

{134211}{134276}IfGeorge didn't know|magic or hypnosis,
{134278}{134330}you know,|I neverwould have known anything.
{134333}{134380}It's an amazing thing.
{134381}{134464}You can actually put somebody|under and then force them to do|the most outrageous things.
{134466}{134513}That is absolutelywrong.
{134514}{134600}A person will not do|anything under hypnosis that|theywouldn't do in real life.
