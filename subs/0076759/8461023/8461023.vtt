1
00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:26.517
A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....

2
00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:33.734
STAR
WARS

3
00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:41.946
It is a period of civil war.

4
00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:47.500
Rebel spaceships, striking from
a hidden base...

5
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.100
...have won their first victory
against the evil Galactic Empire.

6
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.772
During the battle, rebel spies
managed to steal...

7
00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:07.100
...secret plans to the Empire’s ultimate
weapon, the DEATH STAR...

8
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.393
...an armored space station
with enough power...

9
00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:16.647
...to destroy an entire planet.

10
00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:21.319
Pursued by the Empire’s
sinister agents...

11
00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:26.616
...Princess Leia races home
aboard her starship...

12
00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:31.913
...custodian of the stolen plans
that can save her people...

13
00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:37.220
...and restore freedom to the galaxy....

14
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.634
Did you hear that?

15
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.101
They shut down the main reactor.
We’ll be destroyed for sure.

16
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:55.001
This is madness.

17
00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:06.517
We’re doomed.

18
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.100
There’ll be no escape
for the princess this time.

19
00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.726
What’s that?

20
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000
R2-D2, where are you?

21
00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.818
At last! Where have you been?

22
00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:21.820
They’re heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

23
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.421
We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,
or smashed into who knows what!

24
00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.259
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

25
00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:44.700
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

26
00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:47.713
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

27
00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:53.019
– What have you done with those plans?
– We intercepted no transmissions.

28
00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.090
This is a consular ship.
We’re on a diplomatic mission.

29
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.789
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

30
00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:09.132
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you’ve found those plans...

31
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:12.232
...and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

32
00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:26.517
There’s one. Set for stun.

33
00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:35.000
She’ll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

34
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.560
Hey! You’re not permitted in there.
It’s restricted.

35
00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:42.262
You’ll be deactivated for sure.

36
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:46.738
Don’t you call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease!

37
00:06:46.838 --> 00:06:48.938
Now come out before somebody sees you.

38
00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:55.677
Secret mission? What plans? What are
you talking about? I’m not getting in there.

39
00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:00.383
I’m going to regret this.

40
00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:09.427
– There goes another one.
– Hold your fire.

41
00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:12.465
There’s no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.

42
00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:16.065
That’s funny. The damage
doesn’t look as bad from out here.

43
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.300
Are you sure this thing is safe?

44
00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:22.507
Oh.

45
00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.825
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

46
00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:45.365
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you’ve attacked a diplomatic—

47
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.666
Don’t act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren’t on any mercy mission this time.

48
00:07:49.967 --> 00:07:53.740
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

49
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.709
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

50
00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:58.610
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

51
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.914
I’m a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

52
00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:04.884
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

53
00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:06.984
Take her away!

54
00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:13.524
Holding her is dangerous.
If word of this gets out...

55
00:08:13.624 --> 00:08:16.227
...it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the Senate.

56
00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:21.428
I’ve traced the rebel spies to her. Now she is
my only link to finding their secret base.

57
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:24.701
– She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
– Leave that to me.

58
00:08:25.402 --> 00:08:29.409
Send a distress signal and then inform
the Senate that all aboard were killed.

59
00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.801
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

60
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:34.707
...and no transmissions were made.

61
00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:38.308
An escape pod was jettisoned during
the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

62
00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:40.849
She must have hidden the plans
in the escape pod.

63
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:44.791
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

64
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.600
– There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
– Yes, sir.

65
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.277
How did we get into this mess?

66
00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:07.741
I really don’t know how.

67
00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:11.313
We seem to be made to suffer.
It’s our lot in life.

68
00:09:14.452 --> 00:09:17.852
I’ve got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

69
00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:27.663
What a desolate place this is!

70
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.339
Where do you think you’re going?

71
00:09:33.439 --> 00:09:35.440
Well, I’m not going that way.

72
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.540
It’s much too rocky.
This way is much easier.

73
00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:42.477
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

74
00:09:44.078 --> 00:09:45.978
Don’t get technical with me.

75
00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:48.884
What mission? What are you talking about?

76
00:09:51.456 --> 00:09:53.756
I’ve just about had enough of you.

77
00:09:54.026 --> 00:09:58.597
Go that way. You’ll be malfunctioning
within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.

78
00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:03.100
And don’t let me catch you following me
begging for help, because you won’t get it.

79
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.230
No more adventures.
I’m not going that way.

80
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.701
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

81
00:10:58.801 --> 00:11:02.702
He tricked me into going this way,
but he’ll do no better.

82
00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:11.203
Wait! What’s that?
A transport! I’m saved!

83
00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:14.803
Over here!
Hey! Hey!

84
00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:19.602
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.354
R2?

86
00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:57.592
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:19.814
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:21.987
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:35.666
Wake up! Wake up!

90
00:15:42.373 --> 00:15:44.373
We’re doomed.

91
00:15:52.383 --> 00:15:55.083
Do you think they’ll melt us down?

92
00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.999
Don’t shoot!
Don’t shoot!

93
00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.568
Will this never end?

94
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.045
All right, fine. Let’s go.

95
00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:55.306
Luke! Luke!

96
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.650
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

97
00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:07.322
Doesn’t look like we have much
of a choice, but I’ll remind him.

98
00:17:17.768 --> 00:17:20.768
Yeah, we’ll take that red one.
No, not that one.

99
00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:26.709
You, I suppose you’re programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

100
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.549
Protocol? Why, it’s my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs—

101
00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:33.551
– I have no need for a protocol droid.
– Of course you haven’t, sir.

102
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:36.555
Not in an environment such as this.
That is why I have been programmed—

103
00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:41.956
What I really need is a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

104
00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:44.327
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

105
00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:47.028
...very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

106
00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:48.900
– Can you speak Bocce?
– Of course I can, sir. It’s like...

107
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.100
– ...a second language to me. I’m as fluent—
– Yeah, all right. Shut up. I’ll take this one. Luke!

108
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.111
Take these two over to the garage, will you?
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

109
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:01.647
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

110
00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:04.648
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

111
00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:09.180
– Now come on. Get to it.
– All right. Come on.

112
00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.949
And the red one. Come on.

113
00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:17.662
Well, come on, red. Let’s go.

114
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.580
– Uncle Owen!
– Yeah?

115
00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:41.481
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

116
00:18:41.853 --> 00:18:44.199
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

117
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:51.523
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

118
00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:54.499
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

119
00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:57.902
What about that blue one?
We’ll take that one.

120
00:18:58.303 --> 00:19:01.305
– Yeah, take this away.
– You’ll be very pleased with that one, sir.

121
00:19:01.405 --> 00:19:04.305
He really is in first-class condition.
I’ve worked with him before.

122
00:19:04.405 --> 00:19:06.205
Here he comes.

123
00:19:09.247 --> 00:19:11.149
Okay, let’s go.

124
00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:13.886
Now, don’t you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you...

125
00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.986
...is quite beyond my capacity.

126
00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:26.129
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

127
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.600
I’ve got such a bad case
of dust contamination, I can barely move.

128
00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:35.841
It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right.
I’m never gonna get out of here.

129
00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:40.142
– Is there anything I might do to help?
– No. Not unless you can alter time...

130
00:19:40.242 --> 00:19:43.242
...speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

131
00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:47.686
I don’t think so, sir. I’m only a droid, and
not very knowledgeable about such things...

132
00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:53.025
...not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact,
I’m not even sure which planet I’m on.

133
00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:58.063
Well, if there’s a bright center to the universe,
you’re on the planet that it’s farthest from.

134
00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:01.166
– I see, sir.
– You can call me Luke.

135
00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:03.266
I see, Sir Luke.

136
00:20:04.031 --> 00:20:05.532
Just Luke.

137
00:20:05.632 --> 00:20:11.132
Oh. And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

138
00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:14.209
Hello.

139
00:20:15.379 --> 00:20:18.650
You’ve got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

140
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.101
With all we’ve been through,
sometimes I’m amazed...

141
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:24.000
...we’re in as good condition as we are,
what with the rebellion and all.

142
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.824
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?!

143
00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:29.124
That’s how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

144
00:20:29.825 --> 00:20:31.926
– Have you been in many battles?
– Several, I think.

145
00:20:32.026 --> 00:20:35.801
Actually, there’s not much to tell.
I’m not much more than an interpreter...

146
00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:40.169
...and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.

147
00:20:41.239 --> 00:20:45.174
Well, my little friend, you’ve got something
jammed in here real good.

148
00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:47.244
Were you on a Starcruiser or—

149
00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:50.748
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

150
00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:52.449
What’s this?

151
00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.521
“What is what?” He asked you a question.
What is that?

152
00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:59.316
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

153
00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:06.593
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

154
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.505
Oh. He says it’s nothing, sir. Merely
a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.

155
00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:16.008
Who is she?
She’s beautiful.

156
00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:19.478
I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.

157
00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:21.980
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

158
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.283
A person of some importances, I believe.
Our captain was attached to—

159
00:21:25.383 --> 00:21:27.483
Is there any more to this recording?

160
00:21:28.785 --> 00:21:31.657
Behave yourself, R2.
You’re going to get us into trouble.

161
00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:34.799
It’s all right. You can trust him.
He’s our new master.

162
00:21:37.996 --> 00:21:40.732
He says that he’s the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

163
00:21:40.832 --> 00:21:44.236
...a resident of these parts,
and it’s a private message for him.

164
00:21:44.336 --> 00:21:46.305
Quite frankly, sir, I don’t know what
he’s talking about.

165
00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:49.901
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we’ve been through...

166
00:21:50.001 --> 00:21:52.201
...this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

167
00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:56.381
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

168
00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:59.151
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he’s talking about?

169
00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:03.999
Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan,
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

170
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.000
He’s kind of a strange old hermit.

171
00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:10.762
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she’s in trouble.

172
00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.862
I better play back the whole thing.

173
00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:19.866
He says the restraining bolt
has short-circuited his recording system.

174
00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:22.501
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

175
00:22:22.601 --> 00:22:24.744
...he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

176
00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.546
Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...

177
00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:30.082
...I guess you’re too small
to run away on me...

178
00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.282
...if I take this off. Okay...

179
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.220
There you go.

180
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.782
Wait a minute. Where’d she go?
Bring her back. Play back the entire message.

181
00:22:42.383 --> 00:22:45.385
“What message?”
The one you’ve just been playing!

182
00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:47.400
The one you’re carrying
inside your rusty innards.

183
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.626
Luke! Luke!

184
00:22:50.101 --> 00:22:53.201
– All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru.
– I’m sorry, sir...

185
00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:55.641
...but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

186
00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:59.170
Here. See what you can do with him.
I’ll be right back.

187
00:23:01.901 --> 00:23:04.501
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

188
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.000
No, I don’t think he likes you at all.

189
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.920
No, I don’t like you, either.

190
00:23:19.229 --> 00:23:22.065
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

191
00:23:22.165 --> 00:23:23.768
What makes you think that?

192
00:23:23.868 --> 00:23:25.804
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

193
00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.873
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

194
00:23:31.609 --> 00:23:35.411
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he’s talking about?

195
00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:41.981
– I wonder if he’s related to Ben.
– That wizard’s just a crazy old man.

196
00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:46.080
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit
to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

197
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:49.860
That’ll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

198
00:23:50.161 --> 00:23:53.201
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

199
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:58.701
He won’t. I don’t think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

200
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.070
– He knew my father?
– I told you to forget it.

201
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.200
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

202
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.849
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

203
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:12.049
– ...working on those condensers.
– Yes, sir.

204
00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:15.887
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

205
00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:19.424
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

206
00:24:19.524 --> 00:24:23.401
...about me staying on another season...

207
00:24:23.501 --> 00:24:26.700
...and if these new droids do work out,
I want to transmit my application...

208
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.701
– ...to the academy this year.
– You mean the next semester...

209
00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:32.001
– ...before the harvest?
– Sure. There’s more than enough droids.

210
00:24:32.101 --> 00:24:35.301
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It’s only one season more.

211
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.301
This year we’ll make enough on the harvest
that I’ll be able to hire some more hands...

212
00:24:40.401 --> 00:24:44.882
...and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

213
00:24:44.982 --> 00:24:47.719
– But it’s a whole ’nother year!
– Look, it’s only one more season.

214
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:50.220
Yeah, that’s what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

215
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.721
– Where are you going?
– Looks like I’m going nowhere.

216
00:24:52.821 --> 00:24:54.500
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

217
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.959
Owen, he can’t stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

218
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.057
– It means so much to him.
– I’ll make it up to him next year. I promise.

219
00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:08.697
Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

220
00:25:09.073 --> 00:25:11.573
That’s what I’m afraid of.

221
00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:02.059
What are you doing hiding back there?

222
00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:04.996
It wasn’t my fault, sir.
Please don’t deactivate me.

223
00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:08.197
I told him not to go,
but he’s faulty, malfunctioning.

224
00:26:08.297 --> 00:26:11.801
– Kept babbling on about his mission.
– Oh, no.

225
00:26:20.144 --> 00:26:23.045
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

226
00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:25.101
These astrodroids are getting
quite out of hand.

227
00:26:25.201 --> 00:26:27.500
Even I can’t understand their logic at times.

228
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.313
How could I be so stupid?
He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it!

229
00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:34.090
– Pardon me, sir, but couldn’t we go after him?
– It’s too dangerous...

230
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.200
...with all the Sand People around.
We’ll have to wait until morning.

231
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.500
Luke! I’m shutting the power down.

232
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.124
All right! I’ll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.

233
00:26:44.201 --> 00:26:46.071
You know, that little droid’s gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

234
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:48.571
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

235
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.284
Luke?
Luke! Luke!

236
00:27:11.395 --> 00:27:12.998
Have you seen Luke this morning?

237
00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:16.501
He said he had some things to do
before he started today, so he left early.

238
00:27:16.601 --> 00:27:20.000
– Did he take those two new droids with him?
– I think so.

239
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.301
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

240
00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:24.941
...repaired by midday,
or there’ll be hell to pay.

241
00:27:26.143 --> 00:27:28.513
Lookit, there’s a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

242
00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:31.741
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

243
00:27:54.037 --> 00:27:55.970
Hey, whoa! Just where do
you think you’re going?

244
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:59.501
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

245
00:27:59.601 --> 00:28:03.101
We’ll have no more of this
Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

246
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.452
And don’t talk to me of your mission, either.
You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast you...

247
00:28:06.552 --> 00:28:10.046
– ...into a million pieces right here!
– No. It’s all right, but I think we’d better go.

248
00:28:12.046 --> 00:28:13.625
What’s wrong with him now?

249
00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:16.525
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

250
00:28:16.926 --> 00:28:19.126
Sand People, or worse.

251
00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:23.865
Come on, let’s go have a look.
Come on!

252
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.271
Well, there are two Banthas down there...

253
00:28:28.371 --> 00:28:30.664
...but I don’t see any...
Wait a second.

254
00:28:31.742 --> 00:28:34.973
They’re Sand People, all right.
I can see one of them now.

255
00:29:49.553 --> 00:29:51.353
Hello, there.

256
00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:56.190
Come here, my little friend.
Don’t be afraid.

257
00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:01.029
Oh, don’t worry.
He’ll be all right.

258
00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:09.371
Rest easy, son.
You’ve had a busy day.

259
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.171
You’re fortunate to be all in one piece.

260
00:30:16.547 --> 00:30:18.605
Ben?
Ben Kenobi?

261
00:30:19.183 --> 00:30:21.185
Boy, am I glad to see you.

262
00:30:21.285 --> 00:30:24.285
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

263
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.100
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

264
00:30:31.801 --> 00:30:33.901
This little droid.

265
00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.901
I think he’s searching for his former master,
but I’ve never seen such devotion...

266
00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:40.001
...in a droid before.

267
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.767
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

268
00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:47.577
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he’s talking about?

269
00:30:48.245 --> 00:30:52.145
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.

270
00:30:54.751 --> 00:30:58.645
Now, that’s a name
I’ve not heard in a long time.

271
00:30:59.323 --> 00:31:01.223
A long time.

272
00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:05.219
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

273
00:31:05.596 --> 00:31:08.392
Oh, he’s not dead.
Not yet.

274
00:31:08.966 --> 00:31:12.936
– You know him?
– Well, of course I know him. He’s me.

275
00:31:15.973 --> 00:31:18.877
I haven’t gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

276
00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:21.445
...since, oh, before you were born.

277
00:31:21.812 --> 00:31:23.614
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

278
00:31:23.714 --> 00:31:26.110
I don’t seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

279
00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.619
Very interesting.

280
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.961
I think we’d better get indoors.
The Sand People are easily startled...

281
00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.662
...but they’ll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

282
00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:44.467
3PO.

283
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:56.211
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

284
00:31:57.915 --> 00:32:00.718
Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here
before the Sand People return.

285
00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:03.321
I don’t think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

286
00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:06.124
There’s no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

287
00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:08.324
I’m done for.

288
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.457
– No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?
– Quickly. They’re on the move.

289
00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:21.472
No, my father didn’t fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

290
00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.341
That’s what your uncle told you.

291
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.377
He didn’t hold with your father’s ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here...

292
00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:28.342
...and not gotten involved.

293
00:32:29.013 --> 00:32:33.384
– You fought in the Clone Wars?
– Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

294
00:32:33.484 --> 00:32:35.584
...the same as your father.

295
00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:42.555
– I wish I’d known him.
– He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

296
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.929
...and a cunning warrior.

297
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:48.594
I understand you’ve become
quite a good pilot yourself.

298
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:53.864
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...

299
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.300
...I have something here for you.

300
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.700
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

301
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.350
...but your uncle wouldn’t allow it.

302
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.720
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...

303
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.589
...like your father did.

304
00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:13.992
Sir, if you’ll not be needing me,
I’ll close down for a while.

305
00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:16.092
Sure. Go ahead.

306
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.895
– What is it?
– Your father’s lightsaber.

307
00:33:22.666 --> 00:33:25.236
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

308
00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:29.240
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

309
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:35.245
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

310
00:33:36.313 --> 00:33:39.550
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

311
00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.744
...of peace and justice in the old Republic...

312
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:47.384
...before the dark times...
before the Empire.

313
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.100
How did my father die?

314
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:57.200
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

315
00:33:57.401 --> 00:33:59.964
...who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

316
00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:04.099
...helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

317
00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:08.543
He betrayed and murdered your father.

318
00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:12.479
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

319
00:34:13.817 --> 00:34:17.354
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

320
00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.022
The Force?

321
00:34:20.657 --> 00:34:23.000
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

322
00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.131
It’s an energy field created
by all living things.

323
00:34:26.231 --> 00:34:30.792
It surrounds us, penetrates us,
it binds the galaxy together.

324
00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:41.372
Now let’s see if we can’t figure out
what you are, my little friend...

325
00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:43.880
...and where you come from.

326
00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:47.085
– I saw part of a message he w—
– I seem to have found it.

327
00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:51.451
<i>General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

328
00:34:51.922 --> 00:34:55.092
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

329
00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:58.196
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father’s request to you in person.</i>

330
00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:00.064
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack...</i>

331
00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:03.100
<i>...and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

332
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.104
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

333
00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:10.004
<i>...into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

334
00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:14.437
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

335
00:35:14.812 --> 00:35:17.012
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

336
00:35:17.313 --> 00:35:20.375
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

337
00:35:35.499 --> 00:35:39.431
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you’re to come with me to Alderaan.

338
00:35:40.504 --> 00:35:42.904
Alderaan?
I’m not going to Alderaan.

339
00:35:43.073 --> 00:35:45.509
I’ve got to get home. It’s late.
I’m in for it as it is.

340
00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:48.009
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

341
00:35:48.579 --> 00:35:51.107
I’m getting too old for this sort of thing.

342
00:35:56.186 --> 00:35:59.486
I can’t get involved.
I’ve got work to do.

343
00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:04.657
It’s not that I like the Empire. I hate it,
but there’s nothing I can do about it right now.

344
00:36:06.196 --> 00:36:10.400
– It’s all such a long way from here.
– That’s your uncle talking.

345
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.395
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

346
00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:16.171
Learn about the Force, Luke.

347
00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:25.000
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

348
00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:29.109
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.

349
00:36:29.886 --> 00:36:32.713
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

350
00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:44.067
Until this battle station
is fully operational, we are vulnerable.

351
00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:48.295
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They’re more dangerous than you realize.

352
00:36:48.972 --> 00:36:53.103
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...
not to this battle station.

353
00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:57.315
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate—

354
00:36:57.415 --> 00:37:01.119
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

355
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:05.314
I have just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

356
00:37:05.689 --> 00:37:09.627
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

357
00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.427
That’s impossible.

358
00:37:11.695 --> 00:37:14.264
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

359
00:37:14.364 --> 00:37:18.564
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

360
00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:22.697
Fear will keep the local systems in line...

361
00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:26.144
– ...fear of this battle station.
– And what of the rebellion?

362
00:37:26.244 --> 00:37:29.547
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

363
00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:33.781
...it is possible, however unlikely, that they
might find a weakness and exploit it.

364
00:37:34.551 --> 00:37:38.117
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

365
00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:40.625
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

366
00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:44.551
...would be a useless gesture, no matter
what technical data they’ve obtained.

367
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:48.292
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

368
00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:50.966
I suggest we use it.

369
00:37:51.368 --> 00:37:54.601
Don’t be too proud of this
technological terror you’ve constructed.

370
00:37:55.372 --> 00:37:58.375
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant...

371
00:37:58.475 --> 00:38:00.444
...next to the power of the Force.

372
00:38:00.544 --> 00:38:04.002
Don’t try to frighten us with
your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader.

373
00:38:04.481 --> 00:38:06.951
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

374
00:38:07.051 --> 00:38:09.642
...has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

375
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.052
...or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels’ hidden fortr—

376
00:38:20.664 --> 00:38:22.864
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

377
00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:27.397
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

378
00:38:27.671 --> 00:38:29.371
As you wish.

379
00:38:31.442 --> 00:38:33.442
This bickering is pointless.

380
00:38:34.711 --> 00:38:38.182
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

381
00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:41.118
...by the time this station is operational.

382
00:38:41.218 --> 00:38:45.121
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

383
00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:53.898
It looks like the Sand People
did this, all right.

384
00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.733
Look. There’s gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

385
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.302
It’s just, I’ve never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

386
00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:01.772
They didn’t...
but we are meant to think they did.

387
00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:06.043
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sand People always ride single file...

388
00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:08.045
...to hide their numbers.

389
00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:10.881
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

390
00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:15.379
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sand People.

391
00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:19.082
Only Imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

392
00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:22.356
But why would Imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

393
00:39:27.864 --> 00:39:30.401
If they traced the robots here, they
may have learned who they sold them to...

394
00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:32.701
...and that would lead them back... home!

395
00:39:33.436 --> 00:39:36.405
Wait, Luke!
It’s too dangerous!

396
00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:04.168
Uncle Owen!
Aunt Beru!

397
00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:06.368
Uncle Owen!

398
00:40:55.218 --> 00:41:00.520
And now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

399
00:41:43.666 --> 00:41:46.736
There’s nothing you could
have done, Luke, had you been there.

400
00:41:46.836 --> 00:41:51.400
You’d have been killed, too, and the droids
would now be in the hands of the Empire.

401
00:41:53.275 --> 00:41:55.475
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

402
00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:59.383
There’s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force...

403
00:41:59.483 --> 00:42:01.883
...and become a Jedi like my father.

404
00:42:16.933 --> 00:42:19.200
Mos Eisley spaceport.

405
00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:24.436
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

406
00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:27.108
We must be cautious.

407
00:42:43.326 --> 00:42:45.562
– How long have you had these droids?
– About three or four seasons.

408
00:42:45.662 --> 00:42:48.162
They’re up for sale if you want them.

409
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:52.767
– Let me see your identification.
– You don’t need to see his identification.

410
00:42:53.836 --> 00:42:57.672
– We don’t need to see his identification.
– These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.

411
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:01.110
These aren’t the droids we’re looking for.

412
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.410
He can go about his business.

413
00:43:04.247 --> 00:43:06.773
– You can go about your business.
– Move along.

414
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.850
Move along.
Move along.

415
00:43:20.897 --> 00:43:23.633
I can’t abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

416
00:43:25.001 --> 00:43:26.901
Go on, go on.

417
00:43:28.338 --> 00:43:31.508
I can’t understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

418
00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:35.812
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

419
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.552
Do you really think we’re gonna find a pilot
here that’ll take us to Alderaan?

420
00:43:42.652 --> 00:43:45.189
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

421
00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:48.553
...only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.

422
00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:51.226
I’m ready for anything.

423
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:56.731
Come along, R2.

424
00:44:47.216 --> 00:44:50.421
– Hey! We don’t serve their kind here.
– What?

425
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:53.790
Your droids, they’ll have to wait outside.
We don’t want them here.

426
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.226
Why don’t you wait out by the speeder?
We don’t want any trouble.

427
00:44:56.326 --> 00:44:58.226
I heartily agree with you, sir.

428
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.571
I’ll have one of those.

429
00:45:44.974 --> 00:45:47.941
– He doesn’t like you.
– I’m sorry.

430
00:45:49.011 --> 00:45:51.111
I don’t like you, either.

431
00:45:51.514 --> 00:45:57.217
You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

432
00:45:57.587 --> 00:45:59.389
I’ll be careful.

433
00:45:59.489 --> 00:46:02.858
– You’ll be dead!
– This little one’s not worth the effort.

434
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.400
Come, let me get you something.

435
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.200
No blasters! No blasters!

436
00:46:32.355 --> 00:46:34.055
I’m all right.

437
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.753
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

438
00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:46.799
I don’t like the look of this.

439
00:47:01.551 --> 00:47:04.851
Han Solo. I’m captain
of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

440
00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:08.522
Chewie here tells me you’re looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

441
00:47:08.692 --> 00:47:11.000
Yes, indeed, if it’s a fast ship.

442
00:47:11.194 --> 00:47:14.670
Fast ship? You’ve never heard
of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?

443
00:47:15.097 --> 00:47:16.500
Should I have?

444
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.463
It’s the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

445
00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:25.843
I’ve outrun Imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

446
00:47:25.943 --> 00:47:28.543
I’m talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

447
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.500
She’s fast enough for you, old man.

448
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.500
– What’s the cargo?
– Only passengers...

449
00:47:36.051 --> 00:47:38.811
Myself, the boy, two droids...

450
00:47:39.989 --> 00:47:42.089
...and no questions asked.

451
00:47:43.459 --> 00:47:45.462
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

452
00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.750
Let’s just say we’d like to avoid...

453
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.266
...any Imperial entanglements.

454
00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:54.134
Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it?

455
00:47:55.104 --> 00:47:57.604
And it’s gonna cost you something extra.

456
00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.708
Ten thousand, all in advance.

457
00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:03.745
Ten thousand?

458
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.980
We could almost buy our own ship for that!

459
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.201
– But who’s gonna fly it, kid? You?
– You bet I could.

460
00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:13.989
I’m not such a bad pilot myself.
We don’t have to sit here and listen...

461
00:48:14.957 --> 00:48:17.161
We can pay you two thousand now...

462
00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:20.321
...plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

463
00:48:21.397 --> 00:48:23.097
Seventeen, huh?

464
00:48:26.234 --> 00:48:28.538
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

465
00:48:28.638 --> 00:48:31.200
We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready.
Docking Bay 94.

466
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.000
Ninety-four.

467
00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:38.582
Looks like somebody’s beginning to
take an interest in your handiwork.

468
00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.809
All right. We’ll check it out.

469
00:48:52.895 --> 00:48:54.896
Seventeen thousand!

470
00:48:54.996 --> 00:48:57.901
Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.

471
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.671
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

472
00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:02.339
You’ll have to sell your speeder.

473
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:06.012
That’s okay. I’m never coming back
to this planet again.

474
00:49:07.198 --> 00:49:08.681
Going somewhere, Solo?

475
00:49:08.781 --> 00:49:11.485
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

476
00:49:11.585 --> 00:49:13.485
Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.

477
00:49:13.952 --> 00:49:18.417
It’s too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance.

478
00:49:18.738 --> 00:49:25.008
Jabba’s put a price on your head so large every
bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you...

479
00:49:25.346 --> 00:49:27.008
I’m lucky I found you first.

480
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.569
Yeah, but this time I’ve got the money.

481
00:49:29.719 --> 00:49:33.061
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

482
00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:36.139
I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba—

483
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.233
Jabba’s through with you.

484
00:49:39.395 --> 00:49:41.692
He has no time for smugglers...

485
00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:46.110
...who drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

486
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.512
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

487
00:49:48.612 --> 00:49:52.496
You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.

488
00:49:53.192 --> 00:49:54.660
Over my dead body.

489
00:49:54.871 --> 00:49:56.053
That’s the idea.

490
00:49:56.428 --> 00:50:00.124
I’ve been looking forward to this for a long time.

491
00:50:00.433 --> 00:50:02.333
Yes, I’ll bet you have.

492
00:50:16.015 --> 00:50:18.015
Sorry about the mess.

493
00:50:26.692 --> 00:50:29.663
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

494
00:50:29.763 --> 00:50:32.857
It’ll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

495
00:50:33.332 --> 00:50:35.268
The final checkout is completed.

496
00:50:35.368 --> 00:50:38.537
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?

497
00:50:39.405 --> 00:50:42.775
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

498
00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:44.277
What do you mean?

499
00:50:44.377 --> 00:50:47.614
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

500
00:50:47.714 --> 00:50:50.100
– Set your course for Alderaan.
– With pleasure.

501
00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.250
Lock the door, R2.

502
00:50:55.687 --> 00:50:57.987
All right, check this side of the street.

503
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:04.224
The door’s locked.
Move on to the next one.

504
00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:14.807
I would much rather have gone
with Master Luke than stay here with you.

505
00:51:14.907 --> 00:51:18.099
I don’t know what all this trouble is about,
but I’m sure it must be your fault.

506
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.612
You watch your language.

507
00:51:22.815 --> 00:51:25.652
All right. Give it to me.
I’ll take it.

508
00:51:25.752 --> 00:51:29.356
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren’t in demand.

509
00:51:29.456 --> 00:51:31.256
It’ll be enough.

510
00:51:48.575 --> 00:51:52.075
If the ship’s as fast as he’s boasting,
we ought to do well.

511
00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.402
What a piece of junk!

512
00:52:16.502 --> 00:52:18.632
She’ll make .5 past light speed.

513
00:52:18.905 --> 00:52:21.941
She may not look like much,
but she’s got it where it counts, kid.

514
00:52:22.041 --> 00:52:24.744
I’ve made a lot of
special modifications myself.

515
00:52:24.844 --> 00:52:28.937
But we’re a little rushed, so if you’ll
just get on board we’ll get outta here.

516
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.020
Hello, sir.

517
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:46.030
Which way?

518
00:52:47.066 --> 00:52:49.266
All right, men, load your weapons.

519
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.570
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

520
00:53:03.182 --> 00:53:05.382
Chewie, get us out of here!

521
00:53:06.819 --> 00:53:10.185
Oh, my. I’d forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

522
00:53:25.572 --> 00:53:27.006
Looks like an Imperial cruiser.

523
00:53:27.106 --> 00:53:29.542
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought. Try and hold ’em off.

524
00:53:29.642 --> 00:53:33.643
Angle the deflector shields while I make
the calculations for the jump to light speed.

525
00:53:43.489 --> 00:53:46.326
Stay sharp. There’s two more coming in.
They’re gonna try and cut us off.

526
00:53:46.426 --> 00:53:48.261
Why don’t you outrun ’em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

527
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:50.896
Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re
gonna find yourself floating home.

528
00:53:50.996 --> 00:53:53.900
We’ll be safe enough once we
make the jump to hyperspace.

529
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.200
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We’ll lose ’em.

530
00:54:00.673 --> 00:54:02.133
Here’s where the fun begins.

531
00:54:02.233 --> 00:54:04.277
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

532
00:54:04.377 --> 00:54:07.013
It’ll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

533
00:54:07.113 --> 00:54:08.948
Are you kidding?
At the rate they’re gaining?

534
00:54:09.048 --> 00:54:11.818
Traveling through hyperspace
ain’t like dustin’ crops, boy!

535
00:54:11.918 --> 00:54:14.220
Without precise calculations,
we’d fly right through a star...

536
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.788
...or bounce too close to a supernova...

537
00:54:15.888 --> 00:54:18.357
...and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn’t it?

538
00:54:18.457 --> 00:54:20.758
– What’s that flashing?
– We’re losing a deflector shield.

539
00:54:20.858 --> 00:54:23.658
Go strap yourselves in.
I’m gonna make the jump to light speed.

540
00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:47.250
We’ve entered the Alderaan system.

541
00:54:47.819 --> 00:54:51.757
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader’s leash.

542
00:54:52.224 --> 00:54:55.484
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

543
00:54:57.096 --> 00:54:58.896
Charming to the last.

544
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:03.736
You don’t know how hard I found it,
signing the order to terminate your life.

545
00:55:03.836 --> 00:55:07.173
I’m surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

546
00:55:07.273 --> 00:55:11.411
Princess Leia, before your execution,
I would like you to be my guest...

547
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:15.140
...at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

548
00:55:15.514 --> 00:55:18.342
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

549
00:55:18.818 --> 00:55:21.053
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

550
00:55:21.153 --> 00:55:23.723
...the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

551
00:55:23.823 --> 00:55:26.815
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

552
00:55:27.093 --> 00:55:32.262
In a way, you have determined the choice
of the planet that will be destroyed first.

553
00:55:33.132 --> 00:55:37.437
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

554
00:55:37.537 --> 00:55:40.240
...I have chosen to test this station’s
destructive power...

555
00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:43.409
...on your home planet of Alderaan.

556
00:55:43.509 --> 00:55:46.145
No! Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons. You can’t possibly—

557
00:55:46.245 --> 00:55:50.972
You would prefer another target?
A military target? Then name the system.

558
00:55:53.085 --> 00:55:56.286
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

559
00:55:57.056 --> 00:55:59.156
Where is the rebel base?

560
00:56:03.162 --> 00:56:04.962
Dantooine.

561
00:56:05.564 --> 00:56:08.401
– They’re on Dantooine.
– There. You see, Lord Vader?

562
00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:12.999
She can be reasonable. Continue with
the operation. You may fire when ready.

563
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.408
– What?
– You’re far too trusting.

564
00:56:15.508 --> 00:56:19.512
Dantooine is too remote to make
an effective demonstration, but don’t worry.

565
00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:22.515
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

566
00:56:22.615 --> 00:56:24.115
No!

567
00:56:25.751 --> 00:56:27.751
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

568
00:56:50.676 --> 00:56:53.577
Are you all right?
What’s wrong?

569
00:56:53.946 --> 00:56:56.249
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

570
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:59.652
...as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror...

571
00:56:59.752 --> 00:57:04.219
...and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.

572
00:57:06.091 --> 00:57:08.691
You’d better get on with your exercises.

573
00:57:10.963 --> 00:57:13.464
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those Imperial slugs.

574
00:57:13.564 --> 00:57:15.764
I told you I’d outrun them.

575
00:57:19.205 --> 00:57:21.298
Don’t everybody thank me at once.

576
00:57:21.974 --> 00:57:25.868
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

577
00:57:33.352 --> 00:57:35.183
Now be careful, R2.

578
00:57:44.864 --> 00:57:47.364
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can’t help you.

579
00:57:47.565 --> 00:57:49.769
Let him have it. It’s not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

580
00:57:49.869 --> 00:57:52.069
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

581
00:57:52.438 --> 00:57:55.174
That’s ’cause a droid don’t pull
people’s arms out of their sockets...

582
00:57:55.274 --> 00:57:58.868
...when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.

583
00:58:01.413 --> 00:58:03.105
I see your point, sir.

584
00:58:03.205 --> 00:58:06.307
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

585
00:58:25.003 --> 00:58:28.435
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

586
00:58:29.508 --> 00:58:33.511
– You mean it controls your actions?
– Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

587
00:58:39.050 --> 00:58:41.120
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

588
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.949
...for a good blaster at your side, kid.

589
00:58:44.022 --> 00:58:46.324
You don’t believe in the Force, do you?

590
00:58:46.424 --> 00:58:48.694
Kid, I’ve flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

591
00:58:48.794 --> 00:58:51.901
I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff,
but I’ve never seen anything...

592
00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:56.391
...to make me believe there’s one
all-powerful force controlling everything.

593
00:58:57.069 --> 00:59:00.606
There’s no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

594
00:59:00.706 --> 00:59:03.901
It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

595
00:59:04.001 --> 00:59:07.501
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

596
00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.715
This time, let go your conscious self...

597
00:59:12.852 --> 00:59:14.813
...and act on instinct.

598
00:59:16.087 --> 00:59:18.224
With the blast shield down,
I can’t even see.

599
00:59:18.324 --> 00:59:19.925
How am I supposed to fight?

600
00:59:20.025 --> 00:59:22.825
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don’t trust them.

601
00:59:31.737 --> 00:59:33.837
Stretch out with your feelings.

602
00:59:48.487 --> 00:59:52.117
– You see? You can do it.
– I call it luck.

603
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:54.853
In my experience,
there’s no such thing as luck.

604
00:59:55.427 --> 01:00:00.331
Look, good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that’s something else.

605
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.034
Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.

606
01:00:06.806 --> 01:00:09.608
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

607
01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:14.242
That’s good.
You’ve taken your first step into a larger world.

608
01:00:19.384 --> 01:00:22.755
– Yes?
– Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

609
01:00:22.855 --> 01:00:24.757
They found the remains of a rebel base...

610
01:00:24.857 --> 01:00:27.226
...but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

611
01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.887
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

612
01:00:31.963 --> 01:00:33.989
She lied. She lied to us!

613
01:00:34.566 --> 01:00:38.966
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

614
01:00:39.405 --> 01:00:41.807
Terminate her... immediately.

615
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.510
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

616
01:00:50.115 --> 01:00:51.715
What the...?

617
01:00:54.753 --> 01:00:56.555
We’ve come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

618
01:00:56.655 --> 01:00:59.500
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It’s not on any of the charts.

619
01:00:59.624 --> 01:01:02.825
– What’s going on?
– Our position’s correct, except no Alderaan.

620
01:01:03.095 --> 01:01:05.358
– What do you mean? Where is it?
– That’s what I’m trying to tell you, kid.

621
01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:07.032
It ain’t there. It’s been totally blown away.

622
01:01:07.132 --> 01:01:09.835
– What? How?
– Destroyed by the Empire.

623
01:01:09.935 --> 01:01:12.037
The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy
the whole planet.

624
01:01:12.137 --> 01:01:13.998
It would take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I’ve—

625
01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:17.476
There’s another ship coming in.

626
01:01:17.576 --> 01:01:20.600
– Maybe they know what happened.
– It’s an Imperial fighter.

627
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.783
– It followed us!
– No. It’s a short-range fighter.

628
01:01:24.883 --> 01:01:27.883
There aren’t any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

629
01:01:30.155 --> 01:01:32.925
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we’re in big trouble.

630
01:01:33.025 --> 01:01:35.126
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

631
01:01:35.226 --> 01:01:37.328
It would be as well to let it go.
It’s too far out of range.

632
01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:39.228
Not for long.

633
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.698
A fighter that size couldn’t get
this deep into space on its own.

634
01:01:45.971 --> 01:01:48.507
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

635
01:01:48.607 --> 01:01:51.402
Well, he ain’t gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

636
01:01:53.879 --> 01:01:55.447
Look at him.
He’s heading for that small moon.

637
01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:58.448
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He’s almost in range.

638
01:02:00.018 --> 01:02:02.054
That’s no moon.

639
01:02:02.154 --> 01:02:05.553
– It’s a space station.
– It’s too big to be a space station.

640
01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:11.296
I have a very bad feeling about this.

641
01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:13.165
Turn the ship around.

642
01:02:13.265 --> 01:02:17.762
Yeah. I think you’re right. Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

643
01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:24.475
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!

644
01:02:26.845 --> 01:02:28.580
Why are we still moving towards it?!

645
01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.482
We’re caught in a tractor beam.
It’s pulling us in!

646
01:02:30.582 --> 01:02:33.452
– There’s got to be something you can do!
– There’s nothing I can do about it, kid.

647
01:02:33.552 --> 01:02:37.552
I’m full power. I’m gonna have to shut down.
They’re not gonna get me without a fight.

648
01:02:41.226 --> 01:02:44.789
You can’t win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

649
01:03:01.413 --> 01:03:03.549
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

650
01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:06.049
<i>We’re opening the magnetic field.</i>

651
01:03:20.632 --> 01:03:23.298
To your stations!
Come with me.

652
01:03:27.206 --> 01:03:30.831
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

653
01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:34.680
– Yes?
– <i>We’ve captured a freighter...</i>

654
01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.981
<i>...entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

655
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:40.686
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

656
01:03:40.786 --> 01:03:44.323
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

657
01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:47.392
She may yet be of some use to us.

658
01:03:52.364 --> 01:03:56.057
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.</i>
<i>Release charge.</i>

659
01:03:57.903 --> 01:04:00.030
<i>316, report to control.</i>

660
01:04:03.675 --> 01:04:05.376
There’s no one on board, sir.

661
01:04:05.476 --> 01:04:08.476
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

662
01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:11.450
It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the
escape pods have been jettisoned.

663
01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:13.485
– Did you find any droids?
– No, sir.

664
01:04:13.585 --> 01:04:15.420
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

665
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.957
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

666
01:04:19.057 --> 01:04:20.458
Yes, sir.

667
01:04:20.558 --> 01:04:24.652
I sense something...
a presence I’ve not felt since...

668
01:04:27.299 --> 01:04:31.399
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked.

669
01:04:50.455 --> 01:04:52.391
Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments.

670
01:04:52.491 --> 01:04:55.690
I use them for smuggling.
I never thought I’d be smuggling myself in ’em.

671
01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:58.497
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off...

672
01:04:58.597 --> 01:05:01.466
– ...I’d never get past the tractor beam.
– Leave that to me.

673
01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:04.436
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

674
01:05:04.536 --> 01:05:07.996
Who’s the more foolish, the fool
or the fool who follows him?

675
01:05:17.548 --> 01:05:22.186
The ship’s all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

676
01:05:23.054 --> 01:05:24.754
All right, let’s go.

677
01:05:39.004 --> 01:05:40.704
Hey, down there!

678
01:05:42.841 --> 01:05:44.841
Could you give us a hand with this?

679
01:05:53.418 --> 01:05:56.044
TK-421, why aren’t you at your post?

680
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:58.721
TK-421, do you copy?

681
01:06:11.102 --> 01:06:14.502
Take over. We’ve got a bad
transmitter. I’ll see what I can do.

682
01:06:31.522 --> 01:06:33.759
You know, between his howling
and your blasting everything in sight...

683
01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:36.128
...it’s a wonder the whole station
doesn’t know we’re here.

684
01:06:36.228 --> 01:06:39.364
Bring ’em on! I’d prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin’ around.

685
01:06:39.464 --> 01:06:41.200
We’ve found the computer outlet, sir.

686
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:44.398
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire Imperial network.

687
01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:59.351
He says he’s found the main controls to the
power beam that’s holding the ship here.

688
01:06:59.451 --> 01:07:02.046
He’ll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

689
01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:15.434
I don’t think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

690
01:07:15.534 --> 01:07:19.004
Whatever you say. I’ve done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

691
01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:20.372
I want to go with you.

692
01:07:20.472 --> 01:07:22.775
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

693
01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:25.076
– But he can—
– They must be delivered safely...

694
01:07:25.176 --> 01:07:28.179
...or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

695
01:07:28.279 --> 01:07:31.975
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

696
01:07:35.653 --> 01:07:38.987
The Force will be with you...
always.

697
01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:53.490
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

698
01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.903
Ben is a great man.

699
01:07:56.003 --> 01:07:59.007
– Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
– I didn’t hear you give any ideas.

700
01:07:59.107 --> 01:08:01.677
Well, anything’s better than just hangin’ around
waiting for ’em to pick us up.

701
01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.677
Who do you think—

702
01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:07.716
– What is it?
– I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.

703
01:08:07.816 --> 01:08:10.585
He says “I’ve found her”
and keeps repeating “She’s here.”

704
01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:13.421
Well, who... who has he found?

705
01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:15.857
– Princess Leia.
– The princess? She’s here?!

706
01:08:15.957 --> 01:08:17.788
– Princess?!
– Where? Where is she?

707
01:08:17.888 --> 01:08:19.888
Princess?!
What’s going on?

708
01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:28.290
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

709
01:08:32.873 --> 01:08:35.743
I’m afraid she’s scheduled to be terminated.

710
01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:38.346
Oh, no! We’ve got to do something!

711
01:08:38.446 --> 01:08:40.982
– What are you talking about?
– The droids belong to her.

712
01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:43.085
She’s the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

713
01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.987
Now look, don’t get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.

714
01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:49.458
But he didn’t know she was here.
Just find a way back into that detention block.

715
01:08:49.558 --> 01:08:51.994
– I’m not going anywhere.
– They’re going to execute her.

716
01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.396
Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn’t
want to just wait here to be captured.

717
01:08:54.496 --> 01:08:56.001
Now, all you want to do is stay?

718
01:08:56.101 --> 01:08:58.333
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

719
01:08:58.433 --> 01:09:01.962
– But they’re gonna kill her!
– Better her than me!

720
01:09:09.777 --> 01:09:11.677
She’s rich.

721
01:09:13.815 --> 01:09:16.384
– Rich?
– Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

722
01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:19.554
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

723
01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:22.590
– What?
– Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

724
01:09:22.690 --> 01:09:25.691
– I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit.
– You’ll get it.

725
01:09:25.791 --> 01:09:27.991
– I better.
– You will.

726
01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.598
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

727
01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:32.499
– All right.
– What’s your plan?

728
01:09:32.599 --> 01:09:33.970
Uh...

729
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:36.570
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

730
01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.941
Okay...

731
01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:42.271
Now... I’m gonna put these on you.

732
01:09:44.101 --> 01:09:47.415
Okay Han, you... you put those on.

733
01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.175
Don’t worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

734
01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:52.754
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

735
01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:55.990
...but what should R2 and I do
if we’re discovered here?

736
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:59.557
– Lock the door.
– And hope they don’t have blasters.

737
01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:01.657
That isn’t very reassuring.

738
01:10:22.016 --> 01:10:26.016
<i>517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.</i>

739
01:10:30.258 --> 01:10:32.458
<i>316, report to control.</i>

740
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:39.930
<i>53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.</i>

741
01:10:53.214 --> 01:10:55.814
I can’t see a thing in this helmet.

742
01:11:26.713 --> 01:11:29.317
– This is not gonna work.
– Why didn’t you say so before?

743
01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:31.708
I did say so before.

744
01:11:46.734 --> 01:11:49.704
Where are you taking this... thing?

745
01:11:49.804 --> 01:11:52.604
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

746
01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:57.804
I wasn’t notified.
I’ll have to clear it.

747
01:12:04.418 --> 01:12:06.587
– Look out! He’s loose!
– He’ll tear us all apart!

748
01:12:06.687 --> 01:12:08.287
I’ll get him!

749
01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:32.946
Look out!

750
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:45.059
We’ve got to find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

751
01:12:45.159 --> 01:12:49.255
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.
I’ll hold them here.

752
01:12:52.866 --> 01:12:56.504
– Uh, everything’s under control. Situation normal.
– <i>What happened?</i>

753
01:12:56.604 --> 01:13:01.676
Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction,
but, uh, everything’s perfectly all right now.

754
01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:06.247
We’re fine... We’re all fine here now.
Thank you. How are you?

755
01:13:06.347 --> 01:13:07.849
<i>We’re sending a squad up.</i>

756
01:13:07.949 --> 01:13:11.979
Uh, negative, negative!
We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.

757
01:13:12.079 --> 01:13:15.590
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

758
01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:18.355
<i>Who is this? What’s your</i>
<i>operating number?</i>

759
01:13:18.455 --> 01:13:19.955
Uh...

760
01:13:20.861 --> 01:13:25.030
Boring conversation anyway...
Luke! We’re gonna have company!

761
01:13:38.412 --> 01:13:40.715
Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?

762
01:13:40.815 --> 01:13:43.608
Huh?
Oh, the uniform.

763
01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:47.321
I’m Luke Skywalker.
I’m here to rescue you.

764
01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:49.022
– You’re who?
– I’m here to rescue you.

765
01:13:49.122 --> 01:13:51.025
I’ve got your R2 unit.
I’m here with Ben Kenobi.

766
01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.682
– Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?
– Come on!

767
01:13:55.329 --> 01:13:59.367
– He is here.
– Obi-Wan Kenobi?

768
01:13:59.467 --> 01:14:02.771
– What makes you think so?
– A tremor in the Force.

769
01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:06.874
The last time I felt it was
in the presence of my old master.

770
01:14:06.974 --> 01:14:09.443
Surely he must be dead by now.

771
01:14:09.543 --> 01:14:12.413
Don’t underestimate the Force.

772
01:14:12.513 --> 01:14:16.751
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

773
01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:20.288
You, my friend, are all that’s left
of their religion.

774
01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:21.847
Yes.

775
01:14:21.947 --> 01:14:25.547
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

776
01:14:25.893 --> 01:14:28.462
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

777
01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:32.166
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

778
01:14:32.266 --> 01:14:34.836
If you’re right, he must not be
allowed to escape.

779
01:14:34.936 --> 01:14:38.766
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

780
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:49.781
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

781
01:15:01.028 --> 01:15:03.787
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

782
01:15:06.167 --> 01:15:07.568
Can’t get out that way.

783
01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:09.369
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

784
01:15:09.469 --> 01:15:12.669
Maybe you’d like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

785
01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:16.644
– C-3PO, C-3PO!
– <i>Yes, sir?</i>

786
01:15:16.744 --> 01:15:20.244
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We’ve been cut off!

787
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.086
What was that?
I didn’t copy.

788
01:15:25.186 --> 01:15:28.522
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

789
01:15:28.622 --> 01:15:30.723
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

790
01:15:30.823 --> 01:15:33.127
All other information
on your level is restricted.

791
01:15:33.227 --> 01:15:35.627
Open up in there! Open up in there!

792
01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.650
Oh, no!

793
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.900
There isn’t any other way out!

794
01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:47.976
I can’t hold them off forever!
Now what?!

795
01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:51.813
This is some rescue! You came in here,
and you didn’t have a plan for getting out?

796
01:15:51.913 --> 01:15:55.442
– He’s the brains, sweetheart!
– Well, I didn’t...

797
01:15:56.818 --> 01:16:00.653
– What the hell are you doing?
– Somebody has to save our skins.

798
01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:05.057
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

799
01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:13.432
Get in there!

800
01:16:14.034 --> 01:16:17.364
Get in there, you big furry oaf!
I don’t care what you smell.

801
01:16:17.938 --> 01:16:20.305
Get in there, and don’t worry about it.

802
01:16:22.943 --> 01:16:25.043
Wonderful girl!

803
01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:29.745
Either I’m going to kill her,
or I’m beginning to like her.

804
01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.752
Get in there!

805
01:16:45.399 --> 01:16:48.197
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

806
01:16:48.969 --> 01:16:51.864
What an incredible smell
you’ve discovered!

807
01:16:54.442 --> 01:16:56.277
Let’s get out of here.

808
01:16:56.377 --> 01:16:59.111
– Get away from there.
– No, wait!

809
01:17:05.086 --> 01:17:07.955
Will you forget it? I already tried it!
It’s magnetically sealed.

810
01:17:08.055 --> 01:17:10.524
Put that thing away!
You’re gonna get us all killed!

811
01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:12.150
Absolutely, Your Worship.

812
01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.096
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

813
01:17:15.196 --> 01:17:17.632
You know, it’s not gonna take ’em long
to figure out what happened to us!

814
01:17:17.732 --> 01:17:19.732
It could be worse.

815
01:17:24.071 --> 01:17:26.574
– It’s worse.
– There’s something alive in here.

816
01:17:26.674 --> 01:17:31.409
– That’s your imagination.
– Something just moved past my leg.

817
01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.680
Look! Did you see that?

818
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:36.749
What?

819
01:17:56.204 --> 01:17:59.104
Kid! Luke!

820
01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:04.510
Luke!

821
01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:13.546
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

822
01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:16.023
Blast it, will you?
My gun’s jammed.

823
01:18:16.123 --> 01:18:19.182
– Where?
– Anywhere!

824
01:18:26.701 --> 01:18:28.301
Luke, Luke!

825
01:18:51.392 --> 01:18:54.128
Help him!
What happened?

826
01:18:54.228 --> 01:18:58.161
I don’t know. It just let go of me
and disappeared.

827
01:19:04.138 --> 01:19:06.638
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.

828
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.600
– The walls are moving!
– Don’t just stand there!

829
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.900
Try and brace it with something.

830
01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:25.992
Help me!

831
01:19:38.739 --> 01:19:40.539
Wait a minute!

832
01:19:42.676 --> 01:19:46.847
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!

833
01:19:46.947 --> 01:19:50.414
<i>3PO!
Where could he be?</i>

834
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.080
Take over. See to him.

835
01:19:59.615 --> 01:20:01.084
Look, there.

836
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.631
They’re madmen!

837
01:20:04.731 --> 01:20:07.334
They’re heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.

838
01:20:07.434 --> 01:20:09.234
Follow me.

839
01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640
You stand guard.

840
01:20:19.446 --> 01:20:21.746
Come on.

841
01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:25.651
Oh!

842
01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:32.060
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

843
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.227
If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him
down to maintenance.

844
01:20:35.327 --> 01:20:37.827
All right.

845
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.979
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!

846
01:20:52.079 --> 01:20:53.514
3PO!

847
01:20:53.614 --> 01:20:56.083
– Get on top!
– I can’t!

848
01:20:56.183 --> 01:21:01.480
Where could he be?! 3PO!
3PO, will you come in!

849
01:21:01.755 --> 01:21:04.124
They aren’t here. Something
must have happened to them.

850
01:21:04.224 --> 01:21:06.917
See if they’ve been captured.
Hurry!

851
01:21:10.664 --> 01:21:13.499
One thing’s for sure.
We’re all gonna be a lot thinner.

852
01:21:16.036 --> 01:21:19.036
– Get on top of it.
– I’m trying.

853
01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:27.404
Thank goodness they haven’t found them!
Where could they be?

854
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.152
Use the comlink?

855
01:21:31.252 --> 01:21:34.316
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

856
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:39.427
Are you there, sir?

857
01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:40.995
3PO?!

858
01:21:41.095 --> 01:21:43.897
– We’ve had some problems.
– <i>Will you shut up and listen to me?!</i>

859
01:21:43.997 --> 01:21:46.900
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level, will ya?!

860
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Do you copy!? Shut down all the garbage
mashers on the detention level!

861
01:21:51.972 --> 01:21:54.542
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

862
01:21:54.642 --> 01:21:57.142
No! Shut them all down.
Hurry!

863
01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:11.681
What?

864
01:22:13.494 --> 01:22:16.095
Listen to them.
They’re dying, R2!

865
01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:21.202
Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough.
It’s all my fault! My poor master.

866
01:22:21.302 --> 01:22:26.003
We’re all right! You did great! Hey!
Open the pressure maintenance hatch...

867
01:22:26.103 --> 01:22:30.906
...on unit number... where are we?
3263827!

868
01:23:16.889 --> 01:23:20.728
If we can just avoid any more female advice,
we ought to be able to get outta here.

869
01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:23.931
Well, let’s get moving.

870
01:23:24.031 --> 01:23:25.765
Where are you going?

871
01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:28.634
No, wait! They’ll hear!

872
01:23:30.037 --> 01:23:32.538
Come here, you big coward.
Chewie, come here.

873
01:23:32.638 --> 01:23:34.039
Listen...

874
01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:37.003
...I don’t know who you are
or where you came from...

875
01:23:37.103 --> 01:23:40.046
...but from now on, you do
as I tell you, okay?

876
01:23:40.813 --> 01:23:43.751
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let’s get one thing straight.

877
01:23:43.851 --> 01:23:46.987
I take orders from just one person... me!

878
01:23:47.087 --> 01:23:49.123
It’s a wonder you’re still alive.

879
01:23:49.223 --> 01:23:52.393
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

880
01:23:52.493 --> 01:23:54.993
No reward is worth this!

881
01:24:04.805 --> 01:24:08.233
– Give me regular reports, please.
– Right.

882
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:13.310
– Do you know what’s going on?
– Maybe it’s another drill.

883
01:24:18.451 --> 01:24:20.354
You seen that new VT-16?

884
01:24:20.454 --> 01:24:22.623
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

885
01:24:22.723 --> 01:24:24.625
They say it’s... it’s quite a thing to see.

886
01:24:24.725 --> 01:24:27.227
What was that?

887
01:24:27.327 --> 01:24:29.985
Ah, it’s nothing. Outgassing.
Don’t worry about it.

888
01:24:35.335 --> 01:24:37.738
– There she is.
– C-3PO? Do you copy?

889
01:24:37.838 --> 01:24:39.239
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

890
01:24:39.339 --> 01:24:40.901
– Are you safe?
– <i>For the moment.</i>

891
01:24:41.001 --> 01:24:43.340
We’re in the main hangar
across from the ship.

892
01:24:45.312 --> 01:24:48.515
– We’re right above you. Stand by.
– You came in that thing?!

893
01:24:48.615 --> 01:24:51.314
– You’re braver than I thought!
– Nice! Come on.

894
01:24:55.489 --> 01:24:57.184
It’s them!
Blast them!

895
01:24:58.525 --> 01:25:01.094
– Get back to the ship!
– Where are you going? Come back!

896
01:25:01.194 --> 01:25:04.095
– He certainly has courage.
– What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?

897
01:25:04.195 --> 01:25:05.695
Come on.

898
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:33.190
I think we took a wrong turn.

899
01:25:37.698 --> 01:25:39.398
There’s no lock!

900
01:25:42.869 --> 01:25:45.706
– That oughta hold them for a while.
– Quick! We’ve got to get across.

901
01:25:45.806 --> 01:25:49.076
– Find the controls that extend the bridge.
– I think I just blasted it.

902
01:25:49.176 --> 01:25:51.076
They’re coming through!

903
01:26:12.933 --> 01:26:14.833
Here, hold this.

904
01:26:31.218 --> 01:26:32.918
Here they come.

905
01:26:43.529 --> 01:26:45.229
For luck.

906
01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:56.003
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

907
01:27:10.023 --> 01:27:12.023
Where could they be?

908
01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.002
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

909
01:27:45.559 --> 01:27:49.919
I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

910
01:27:50.996 --> 01:27:53.100
The circle is now complete.

911
01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.671
When I left you, I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.

912
01:27:57.771 --> 01:28:00.471
Only a master of evil, Darth.

913
01:28:19.793 --> 01:28:22.562
Your powers are weak, old man.

914
01:28:22.662 --> 01:28:26.299
You can’t win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

915
01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:29.800
...I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

916
01:28:36.976 --> 01:28:39.274
You should not have come back.

917
01:29:04.838 --> 01:29:07.768
Didn’t we just leave this party?

918
01:29:09.242 --> 01:29:11.645
– What kept you?
– We, uh, ran into some old friends.

919
01:29:11.745 --> 01:29:14.247
– The ship all right?
– It seems okay, if we can get to it.

920
01:29:14.347 --> 01:29:17.147
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

921
01:29:31.264 --> 01:29:32.764
Look!

922
01:29:35.602 --> 01:29:38.102
Come on, R2, we’re going.

923
01:29:39.039 --> 01:29:41.039
Now’s our chance! Go!

924
01:29:44.277 --> 01:29:45.777
Ben?

925
01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:01.894
No!

926
01:30:10.504 --> 01:30:13.504
– Come on!
– Come on! Come on!

927
01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:17.508
– Luke, it’s too late!
– Blast the door, kid!

928
01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:29.320
<i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

929
01:30:32.058 --> 01:30:34.128
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

930
01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:37.356
...or this is gonna be a real short trip.
Okay, hit it!

931
01:31:08.394 --> 01:31:10.998
We’re coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off.

932
01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.898
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

933
01:31:22.943 --> 01:31:25.043
I can’t believe he’s gone.

934
01:31:29.081 --> 01:31:30.981
There wasn’t anything
you could have done.

935
01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:33.919
Come on, buddy.
We’re not out of this yet.

936
01:31:50.303 --> 01:31:53.063
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.

937
01:32:03.617 --> 01:32:05.417
Here they come.

938
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.600
They’re coming in too fast!

939
01:32:32.479 --> 01:32:36.745
– We’ve lost the lateral controls!
– Don’t worry. She’ll hold together.

940
01:32:38.251 --> 01:32:40.251
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

941
01:33:01.975 --> 01:33:06.175
– Got him! I got him!
– Great, kid! Don’t get cocky.

942
01:33:07.414 --> 01:33:09.377
There’s still two more of them out there!

943
01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:46.583
– That’s it! We did it!
– We did it!

944
01:33:46.753 --> 01:33:49.613
Help! I think I’m melting!
This is all your fault!

945
01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:58.732
Are they away?

946
01:33:58.832 --> 01:34:01.902
They’ve just made the jump
into hyperspace.

947
01:34:02.002 --> 01:34:06.202
You’re sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

948
01:34:06.339 --> 01:34:10.939
I’m taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.

949
01:34:11.377 --> 01:34:13.680
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

950
01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:17.217
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

951
01:34:17.317 --> 01:34:19.486
That doesn’t sound too hard.

952
01:34:19.586 --> 01:34:23.400
They let us go. It’s the only explanation
for the ease of our escape.

953
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.159
– Easy? You call that easy?
– They’re tracking us.

954
01:34:26.259 --> 01:34:28.327
Not this ship, sister.

955
01:34:29.228 --> 01:34:31.831
At least the information in R2 is still intact.

956
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:36.802
– What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
– The technical readouts of that battle station.

957
01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:40.974
I only hope that when the data’s analyzed,
a weakness can be found.

958
01:34:41.074 --> 01:34:44.244
– It’s not over yet.
– It is for me, sister.

959
01:34:44.344 --> 01:34:47.715
Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution,
and I’m not in it for you, Princess.

960
01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:50.750
I expect to be well paid.
I’m in it for the money.

961
01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:52.753
You needn’t worry about your reward.

962
01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:56.253
If money is all that you love,
then that’s what you’ll receive.

963
01:34:59.159 --> 01:35:03.230
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything...

964
01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.365
...or anybody.

965
01:35:05.465 --> 01:35:07.065
I care!

966
01:35:13.473 --> 01:35:15.173
So...

967
01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.610
– What do you think of her, Han?
– I’m trying not to, kid.

968
01:35:20.379 --> 01:35:21.979
Good.

969
01:35:25.084 --> 01:35:28.053
Still, she’s got a lot of spirit.

970
01:35:29.856 --> 01:35:32.893
I don’t know. What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me—

971
01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:34.793
No.

972
01:36:21.341 --> 01:36:24.544
You’re safe. When we heard about Alderaan,
we feared the worst.

973
01:36:24.644 --> 01:36:28.348
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
You must use the information in this R2 unit...

974
01:36:28.448 --> 01:36:31.306
...to help plan the attack.
It’s our only hope.

975
01:36:52.839 --> 01:36:55.542
– Yes.
– <i>We’re approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

976
01:36:55.642 --> 01:37:00.571
<i>The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>

977
01:37:08.755 --> 01:37:12.926
The battle station is heavily shielded,
and carries a firepower...

978
01:37:13.026 --> 01:37:15.261
...greater than half the starfleet.

979
01:37:15.361 --> 01:37:19.699
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

980
01:37:19.799 --> 01:37:25.101
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

981
01:37:26.471 --> 01:37:30.210
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are
snub fighters going to be against that?

982
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:33.747
Well, the Empire doesn’t consider
a small, one-man fighter...

983
01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:37.347
...to be any threat,
or they’d have a tighter defense.

984
01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:41.020
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

985
01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.619
...has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

986
01:37:44.991 --> 01:37:47.427
The approach will not be easy.

987
01:37:47.527 --> 01:37:50.697
You’re required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

988
01:37:50.797 --> 01:37:53.597
...and skim the surface to this point.

989
01:37:53.967 --> 01:37:56.970
The target area is only two meters wide.

990
01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:01.874
It’s a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

991
01:38:01.974 --> 01:38:05.111
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

992
01:38:05.211 --> 01:38:10.216
A precise hit will start a chain reaction,
which should destroy the station.

993
01:38:10.316 --> 01:38:13.920
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

994
01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:17.190
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes.

995
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:20.359
– That’s impossible, even for a computer.
– It’s not impossible.

996
01:38:20.459 --> 01:38:22.996
I used to bull’s-eye womp rats
in my T-16 back home.

997
01:38:23.096 --> 01:38:25.196
They’re not much bigger than two meters.

998
01:38:25.598 --> 01:38:29.334
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

999
01:38:37.043 --> 01:38:39.834
<i>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.</i>

1000
01:38:40.312 --> 01:38:44.283
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1001
01:38:44.383 --> 01:38:48.955
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1002
01:38:49.055 --> 01:38:53.555
...and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1003
01:38:57.230 --> 01:39:00.230
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

1004
01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.900
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

1005
01:39:06.205 --> 01:39:09.108
So... you got your reward
and you’re just leaving, then?

1006
01:39:09.208 --> 01:39:11.008
That’s right. Yeah.

1007
01:39:12.177 --> 01:39:14.847
I’ve got some old debts
I’ve got to pay off with this stuff.

1008
01:39:14.947 --> 01:39:19.047
And even if I didn’t, you don’t think I’d be
fool enough to stick around here, do you?

1009
01:39:19.418 --> 01:39:23.022
Why don’t you come with us? You’re
pretty good in a fight. We could use you.

1010
01:39:23.122 --> 01:39:26.025
Come on. Why don’t you
take a look around?

1011
01:39:26.125 --> 01:39:28.461
You know what’s about to happen,
what they’re up against.

1012
01:39:28.561 --> 01:39:31.764
They could use a good pilot like you.
You’re turning your back on them.

1013
01:39:31.864 --> 01:39:34.267
What good’s a reward
if you ain’t around to use it?

1014
01:39:34.367 --> 01:39:37.137
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain’t my idea of courage.

1015
01:39:37.237 --> 01:39:40.267
It’s more like... suicide.

1016
01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:44.611
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1017
01:39:44.711 --> 01:39:47.680
I guess that’s what you’re best at, isn’t it?

1018
01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:49.480
Hey, Luke.

1019
01:39:52.218 --> 01:39:54.852
May the Force be with you.

1020
01:40:01.094 --> 01:40:04.525
What are you looking at?
I know what I’m doing.

1021
01:40:08.611 --> 01:40:13.611
<i>All pilots to your stations.
All pilots to your stations.</i>

1022
01:40:19.688 --> 01:40:21.688
– What’s wrong?
– Oh, it’s Han.

1023
01:40:22.089 --> 01:40:24.893
I don’t know. I really thought
he’d change his mind.

1024
01:40:24.994 --> 01:40:28.796
He’s got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1025
01:40:29.464 --> 01:40:31.964
I only wish Ben were here.

1026
01:40:40.009 --> 01:40:42.300
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1027
01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:46.780
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1028
01:40:51.821 --> 01:40:55.157
Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit
beat up. You want a new one?

1029
01:40:55.257 --> 01:40:58.194
Not on your life. That little droid and I
have been through a lot together.

1030
01:40:58.294 --> 01:41:00.194
You okay, R2?

1031
01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:02.396
Good.

1032
01:41:03.232 --> 01:41:06.232
<i>Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1033
01:41:06.636 --> 01:41:09.300
Hang on tight, R2.
You’ve got to come back.

1034
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:13.665
You wouldn’t want my life
to get boring, would you?

1035
01:42:02.291 --> 01:42:06.291
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1036
01:42:16.972 --> 01:42:19.972
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1037
01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:23.709
<i>Estimated time to firing range, 15 minutes.</i>

1038
01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:38.928
– All wings report in.
– Red 10 standing by.

1039
01:42:39.028 --> 01:42:41.164
– <i>Red Seven standing by.</i>
– Red Three standing by.

1040
01:42:41.264 --> 01:42:44.000
– Red Six standing by.
– Red Nine standing by.

1041
01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.469
– Red Two standing by.
– <i>Red 11 standing by.</i>

1042
01:42:46.569 --> 01:42:48.469
Red Five standing by.

1043
01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:52.305
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1044
01:42:55.678 --> 01:42:58.981
– <i>We’re passing through their magnetic field.</i>
– Hold tight.

1045
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:02.746
<i>Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.</i>

1046
01:43:05.221 --> 01:43:08.022
– Look at the size of that thing!
– <i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.</i>

1047
01:43:08.122 --> 01:43:10.217
Accelerate to attack speed.

1048
01:43:12.995 --> 01:43:15.732
– This is it, boys.
– Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1049
01:43:15.832 --> 01:43:18.868
– I copy, Gold Leader.
– We’re starting for the target shaft now.

1050
01:43:18.968 --> 01:43:22.864
We’re in position. I’m going to cut across the axis
and try and draw their fire.

1051
01:43:36.886 --> 01:43:40.286
– <i>Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i>
– <i>I see it. Stay low.</i>

1052
01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:49.896
This is Red Five. I’m going in.

1053
01:43:53.702 --> 01:43:55.602
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1054
01:43:56.405 --> 01:43:59.137
– Are you all right?
– I got a little cooked, but I’m okay.

1055
01:44:04.713 --> 01:44:06.482
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1056
01:44:06.582 --> 01:44:08.584
...but they’re so small,
they’re evading our turbolasers.

1057
01:44:08.684 --> 01:44:12.784
We’ll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.

1058
01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:19.695
Watch yourself. There’s a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.

1059
01:44:19.795 --> 01:44:22.532
– I’m on it.
– I’m going in. Cover me, Porkins.

1060
01:44:22.632 --> 01:44:24.932
I’m right with you, Red Three.

1061
01:44:30.206 --> 01:44:32.006
I’ve got a problem here.

1062
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.801
– Eject!
– I can hold it.

1063
01:44:33.901 --> 01:44:36.301
– Pull up!
– No, no, I’m all—

1064
01:44:40.216 --> 01:44:43.216
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1065
01:44:47.022 --> 01:44:50.222
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1066
01:44:57.733 --> 01:45:01.570
Squad leaders, we’ve
picked up a new group of signals.

1067
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:03.439
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1068
01:45:03.539 --> 01:45:05.307
My scope’s negative.
I don’t see anything.

1069
01:45:05.407 --> 01:45:07.864
– Pick up your visual scanning.
– Here they come.

1070
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:12.800
Watch it. You’ve got one on your tail.

1071
01:45:17.653 --> 01:45:19.253
I’m hit!

1072
01:45:19.989 --> 01:45:23.088
– You’ve picked one up! Watch it!
– I can’t see it!

1073
01:45:24.627 --> 01:45:26.927
He’s on me tight.
I can’t shake him!

1074
01:45:28.163 --> 01:45:30.063
I’ll be right there.

1075
01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:46.103
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1076
01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:51.553
<i>Pull in! Luke, pull in!</i>

1077
01:45:51.653 --> 01:45:55.453
Watch your back, Luke. Watch your back.
Fighters above you, coming in.

1078
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:03.732
I’m hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1079
01:46:03.832 --> 01:46:06.032
Hang on back there.

1080
01:46:06.435 --> 01:46:08.704
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1081
01:46:08.804 --> 01:46:11.573
<i>There’s a heavy fire zone...
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1082
01:46:11.673 --> 01:46:13.373
I can’t shake him!

1083
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.669
I’m on him, Luke. Hold on.

1084
01:46:21.417 --> 01:46:23.544
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1085
01:46:30.559 --> 01:46:32.995
– Thanks, Wedge.
– <i>Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1086
01:46:33.095 --> 01:46:36.556
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We’re starting our attack run.

1087
01:46:37.967 --> 01:46:40.767
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1088
01:46:42.871 --> 01:46:45.240
Stay in attack formation.

1089
01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:48.441
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1090
01:46:53.883 --> 01:46:56.783
<i>Switch all power to front deflector screens.</i>

1091
01:46:56.986 --> 01:46:59.886
<i>Switch all power to front deflector screens.</i>

1092
01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.896
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1093
01:47:06.996 --> 01:47:10.032
<i>Say about 20 guns. Some on the surface,
some on the towers.</i>

1094
01:47:10.132 --> 01:47:13.132
<i>Death Star will be in range in five minutes.</i>

1095
01:47:15.170 --> 01:47:17.370
Switch to targeting computer.

1096
01:47:20.676 --> 01:47:23.135
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1097
01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:27.638
The guns!
They’ve stopped!

1098
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.501
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1099
01:47:31.601 --> 01:47:34.418
They’re coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1100
01:47:36.091 --> 01:47:39.591
– I’ll take them myself. Cover me.
– Yes, sir.

1101
01:47:53.776 --> 01:47:56.412
– It’s no good. I can’t maneuver.
– Stay on target.

1102
01:47:56.512 --> 01:47:58.905
– We’re too close.
– Stay on target.

1103
01:48:00.382 --> 01:48:02.082
Loosen up!

1104
01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.089
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1105
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:09.946
– I copy, Gold Leader.
– They came from behind.

1106
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.634
We’ve analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1107
01:48:18.734 --> 01:48:20.570
Should I have your ship standing by?

1108
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:26.070
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.

1109
01:48:26.608 --> 01:48:29.238
<i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>

1110
01:48:29.711 --> 01:48:33.315
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1111
01:48:33.415 --> 01:48:37.086
– <i>This is Red Two flying toward you.</i>
– <i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1112
01:48:37.186 --> 01:48:38.887
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1113
01:48:38.987 --> 01:48:41.391
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1114
01:48:41.491 --> 01:48:44.160
<i>Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.</i>

1115
01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:47.560
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1116
01:48:56.404 --> 01:48:58.204
This is it!

1117
01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:04.000
We should be able to see it by now.

1118
01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:07.978
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1119
01:49:09.218 --> 01:49:11.754
There’s too much interference. Red Five,
can you see them from where you are?

1120
01:49:11.854 --> 01:49:15.278
– No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
– I see them.

1121
01:49:16.292 --> 01:49:18.092
I’m in range.

1122
01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:20.561
Target’s coming up.

1123
01:49:23.065 --> 01:49:25.400
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1124
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.032
Close up formation.

1125
01:49:29.371 --> 01:49:31.566
Almost there.

1126
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:43.901
– You’d better let her loose. They’re right behind me.
– Almost there.

1127
01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:46.600
I can’t hold them.

1128
01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:56.400
It’s away!

1129
01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.337
– <i>It’s a hit!</i>
– <i>Negative.</i>

1130
01:50:01.437 --> 01:50:03.906
Negative.
It didn’t go in.

1131
01:50:04.006 --> 01:50:06.968
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1132
01:50:12.748 --> 01:50:17.186
Red Leader, we’re right above you.
Turn to .05. We’ll cover for you.

1133
01:50:17.286 --> 01:50:20.586
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1134
01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:23.453
Get set up for your attack run.

1135
01:50:36.238 --> 01:50:39.374
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1136
01:50:39.474 --> 01:50:43.045
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let’s close it up.
We’re going in full throttle.</i>

1137
01:50:43.145 --> 01:50:46.849
– That ought to keep those fighters off our back.
– Right with you, boss.

1138
01:50:46.949 --> 01:50:49.451
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1139
01:50:49.551 --> 01:50:51.876
It’ll be just like Beggar’s Canyon back home.

1140
01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.830
We’ll stay back far enough to cover you.

1141
01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:03.599
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can’t see the exhaust port.</i>

1142
01:51:03.699 --> 01:51:06.099
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1143
01:51:08.537 --> 01:51:12.139
– Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle.
– What about that tower?

1144
01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:15.070
You worry about those fighters!
I’ll worry about the tower!

1145
01:51:20.949 --> 01:51:24.800
R2, that stabilizer’s broken loose again.
See if you can’t lock it down.

1146
01:51:33.862 --> 01:51:35.992
Fighters coming in .3.

1147
01:51:44.405 --> 01:51:46.175
I’m hit!
I can’t stay with you!

1148
01:51:46.275 --> 01:51:48.510
Get clear, Wedge.
You can’t do any more good back there.

1149
01:51:48.610 --> 01:51:50.210
Sorry.

1150
01:51:50.779 --> 01:51:53.013
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1151
01:51:55.284 --> 01:51:58.284
Hurry, Luke. They’re coming in much faster
this time. We can’t hold them.

1152
01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:03.900
R2, try and increase the power.

1153
01:52:10.065 --> 01:52:12.865
<i>Hurry up, Luke!
Wait! Quick!</i>

1154
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:23.000
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1155
01:52:23.145 --> 01:52:25.045
I’m on the leader.

1156
01:52:27.716 --> 01:52:29.415
Hang on, R2.

1157
01:52:44.899 --> 01:52:47.299
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1158
01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:52.163
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1159
01:52:53.842 --> 01:52:56.178
The Force is strong with this one.

1160
01:52:56.278 --> 01:52:58.378
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1161
01:53:03.518 --> 01:53:04.919
<i>His computer’s off.</i>

1162
01:53:05.019 --> 01:53:07.590
<i>Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer! What’s wrong?</i>

1163
01:53:07.690 --> 01:53:09.690
<i>Nothing. I’m all right.</i>

1164
01:53:23.438 --> 01:53:25.038
<i>I’ve lost R2!</i>

1165
01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:28.141
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1166
01:53:28.477 --> 01:53:30.477
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1167
01:53:31.513 --> 01:53:35.513
– <i>Rebel base in range.</i>
– You may fire when ready.

1168
01:53:36.051 --> 01:53:38.051
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1169
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.561
I have you now.

1170
01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:57.000
– What?
– Yahoo!

1171
01:53:59.241 --> 01:54:00.941
Look out!

1172
01:54:06.815 --> 01:54:10.148
You’re all clear, kid!
Now let’s blow this thing and go home!

1173
01:54:16.658 --> 01:54:18.258
<i>Stand by.</i>

1174
01:54:21.429 --> 01:54:23.029
<i>Stand by.</i>

1175
01:54:33.008 --> 01:54:35.408
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1176
01:54:36.311 --> 01:54:40.511
<i>Remember, the Force</i>
<i>will be with you always.</i>

1177
01:55:00.034 --> 01:55:01.534
Luke!

1178
01:55:04.873 --> 01:55:06.274
Hey! Hey!

1179
01:55:06.374 --> 01:55:08.043
I knew you’d come back.
I just knew it.

1180
01:55:08.143 --> 01:55:10.179
Well, I wasn’t going to let you get
all the credit and take all the reward.

1181
01:55:10.279 --> 01:55:13.279
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1182
01:55:13.848 --> 01:55:17.448
– Oh, no!
– Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1183
01:55:17.886 --> 01:55:20.789
Say something.
You can repair him, can’t you?

1184
01:55:20.889 --> 01:55:24.259
– We’ll get to work on him right away.
– You must repair him.

1185
01:55:24.359 --> 01:55:27.262
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help,
I’ll gladly donate them.

1186
01:55:27.362 --> 01:55:29.462
He’ll be all right.
