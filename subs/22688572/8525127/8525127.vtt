0
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.227
Forward!

1
00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.100
Go!

2
00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:57.532
Suetonius Paulinus,

3
00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:02.241
Commander of the 14th Gemina
and the 20th Valeria Victrix!

4
00:04:10.513 --> 00:04:13.691
As Praefectus Castrorum
in charge,

5
00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:15.451
what did you have your men do?

6
00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:19.587
I advanced in triplex formation,
cohorts One to Four.

7
00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:22.932
Three and Five in support.
Auxiliary cavalry on flank.

8
00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:25.296
And...

9
00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.968
What did these cult leaders
of Mona do

10
00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:29.564
when they beheld
your invasion forces?

11
00:04:29.565 --> 00:04:31.599
Chanting as if
in some sort of trance.

12
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.977
Even when facing
the 14th Gemina Legion,

13
00:04:35.978 --> 00:04:40.411
these experienced Celt
fighting men... kneeled?

14
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.084
Trusting that
their religious leaders

15
00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:47.219
would offer them salvation
against your sword.

16
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.926
Yes. It appears that way, Dominus.

17
00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.258
You slaughtered them?

18
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:55.964
As is my duty to Rome.

19
00:04:55.965 --> 00:05:00.232
The Celt Cucullus believe
in the Furies,

20
00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.597
women warriors that symbolize
vengeance and rebirth.

21
00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:04.775
They believe that
a woman warrior

22
00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:06.304
will somehow be their salvation

23
00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:09.208
and end the Roman occupation
of Britannia.

24
00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:14.642
They must not...
find their savior.

25
00:05:14.643 --> 00:05:16.787
As Augustus,
I‘ve issued a strict decree,

26
00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:19.724
forbidding women from holding
a position of influence,

27
00:05:19.725 --> 00:05:22.320
martial, judicial, or otherwise.

28
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:25.764
We don‘t need another woman
like my mother.

29
00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:30.163
This decree must
be upheld verbatim.

30
00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:33.001
And under threat
of severe punishment.

31
00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:37.435
Especially in the tribes
of the island Britannia.

32
00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.207
Your Majesty.

33
00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.936
Uh!

34
00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:48.499
You scared me.

35
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.702
So help me, I love you more
with each day that passes.

36
00:07:55.078 --> 00:07:57.410
I know you have made me
the luckiest man alive.

37
00:07:59.577 --> 00:08:03.888
And you, my king,

38
00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:08.322
have made me the proudest
mother, wife, and queen.

39
00:08:11.226 --> 00:08:13.293
Let me take you, right now.

40
00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:15.823
Like old times.

41
00:08:15.824 --> 00:08:17.265
Mind’s groggy...

42
00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.400
Neither asleep...

43
00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:22.533
nor awake.

44
00:08:22.534 --> 00:08:25.240
Mmm... You‘re definitely awake.

45
00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:30.310
Whatever we do this morning,

46
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:33.951
my noble, brave,
and oh-so-worthy

47
00:08:33.952 --> 00:08:35.678
king of the Iceni,

48
00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.482
we do it for an audience of, uh,

49
00:08:37.483 --> 00:08:41.288
several servants...

50
00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.423
A half dozen guards, and...

51
00:08:44.325 --> 00:08:46.492
Two curious little girls.

52
00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:49.967
They‘re awake, aren‘t they?

53
00:08:49.968 --> 00:08:51.563
Yeah.

54
00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:56.666
Good day my king.

55
00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:58.041
May I join you for breakfast?

56
00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:00.637
You and the entire fort,
dear Ciaran!

57
00:09:00.638 --> 00:09:02.837
C‘mon. Make yourself at home.

58
00:09:02.838 --> 00:09:04.707
I traveled through the night

59
00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:06.379
And I’m hungry.

60
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.216
Hungry. He’s hungry!

61
00:09:08.217 --> 00:09:09.779
I’m hungry!

62
00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:14.124
I’m gonna eat your bones!
Arrrgh!

63
00:09:17.193 --> 00:09:19.062
How goes it in Camulos?

64
00:09:19.063 --> 00:09:20.823
We welcomed a new procurator.

65
00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:23.595
Catus Decianus.

66
00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:25.893
Should I be concerned?

67
00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:27.400
He‘s a Roman.

68
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.567
Spoiled by Africa,
and he hates it here.

69
00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:32.306
He’ll transfer home at the
first sign of insurrection.

70
00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:33.374
Let’s hope.

71
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:38.510
Sorry, Ciaran.

72
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:41.810
My offspring have the
savage blood of the Ancients

73
00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:44.813
running through their veins.

74
00:09:44.814 --> 00:09:46.122
Like their mother.

75
00:09:46.123 --> 00:09:47.585
Your "offspring"...

76
00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:48.993
is the daughter of a king.

77
00:09:48.994 --> 00:09:52.359
A very intelligent and
quick-witted daughter,

78
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.429
who will serve as a great
queen one day.

79
00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:01.038
Mornin’.

80
00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:02.765
Ah! Latin study, girls!

81
00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:04.635
Good morning, girls.
Are we ready for class?

82
00:10:04.636 --> 00:10:06.341
Yes... Hey!

83
00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.873
Little savages.

84
00:10:11.874 --> 00:10:14.612
We earn money to pay
a Roman tutor

85
00:10:14.613 --> 00:10:17.285
to teach our daughters
the language of our occupier,

86
00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:21.455
so they might understand
how to navigate a future...

87
00:10:22.918 --> 00:10:24.292
A future where
their father’s rule

88
00:10:24.293 --> 00:10:26.493
will be a distant memory
of an old colony.

89
00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:29.165
Well, we must change,

90
00:10:29.166 --> 00:10:31.926
if we don’t want to be
left alone in the cold like...

91
00:10:31.927 --> 00:10:33.829
Barbarian Brigantes.

92
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.536
Well, I love my barbarian wife.

93
00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:41.771
You have king-like things
to discuss with brave Ciaran,

94
00:10:41.772 --> 00:10:44.510
my love, and I have
a cosmetics session.

95
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:47.480
And then I’m taking
the girls to the market.

96
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:49.284
We’ll come find you.

97
00:10:49.285 --> 00:10:50.649
Promise me you always will.

98
00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:52.519
I promise.

99
00:10:54.554 --> 00:10:55.983
Sit down. Come on.

100
00:10:55.984 --> 00:10:58.261
Eat this. No waste in here.

101
00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:07.830
We import fashionable cosmetics

102
00:11:07.831 --> 00:11:11.505
from Germania, Gaul,
and fabled Serica.

103
00:11:12.803 --> 00:11:14.903
Some are so expensive and rare,

104
00:11:14.904 --> 00:11:18.776
the Emperor himself chokes when
he pays for his wife’s bill.

105
00:11:27.884 --> 00:11:33.164
Excess hair is not considered
fashionable at all this season.

106
00:11:37.927 --> 00:11:39.499
Rouge for the cheeks,

107
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.029
red ocher, imported from Belgium

108
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.869
and ground against mortar stone
into the finest powder.

109
00:11:48.476 --> 00:11:50.708
The color of your tunic
is so beautiful.

110
00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.039
Where did you find it?

111
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.216
From the Oppida,

112
00:11:53.217 --> 00:11:55.120
outside of Roman security lines.

113
00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:57.287
It was cheap there.

114
00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:02.622
Should we go?

115
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:19.770
Oh, excuse me.

116
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:21.805
We’re looking for the Oppida.

117
00:12:21.806 --> 00:12:23.070
Down there.

118
00:12:23.071 --> 00:12:24.248
Thank you.

119
00:12:40.858 --> 00:12:42.056
What?

120
00:12:42.057 --> 00:12:43.761
What’s the matter with you?

121
00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:45.169
We should not go there.

122
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.204
This is not a place for you.

123
00:12:47.205 --> 00:12:48.238
We’re safe,

124
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:49.965
the Romans are everywhere!

125
00:12:49.966 --> 00:12:51.934
Look what they do to thieves.

126
00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:54.146
These are not criminals,
they’re Christians.

127
00:12:54.872 --> 00:12:56.037
Oh.

128
00:12:56.038 --> 00:12:57.742
Christians don’t mix well

129
00:12:57.743 --> 00:13:00.042
with other religions,
so the Romans crucify them.

130
00:13:00.944 --> 00:13:03.110
We should go back.

131
00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:04.815
I’ll buy a bolt
of that material,

132
00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:06.983
then we can hurry back.
All right?

133
00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:08.787
Come on.

134
00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:26.772
Ah, yes.
What other colors do you have?

135
00:13:29.907 --> 00:13:32.480
Nodens, god of dogs and hunting,

136
00:13:32.481 --> 00:13:34.317
forbidden by Emperor Claudius.

137
00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:37.419
One
of the divine personifications

138
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.718
in the Imperial Cult.

139
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.787
The gods only granted man

140
00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:45.460
the gifts of intelligence,
virtue, and fidelity.

141
00:13:45.461 --> 00:13:46.989
Some fresh fruit?

142
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.760
If the Imperial Cult
was so virtuous,

143
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:50.267
why did they murder
all the Druids?

144
00:13:50.268 --> 00:13:52.369
Hey!
Change the subject please.

145
00:13:57.099 --> 00:13:59.002
Look, Trinovante warriors.

146
00:14:21.057 --> 00:14:23.191
Boudica.

147
00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:26.766
Stop that talk!

148
00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.100
This is Boudica.

149
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:41.351
Why are they kneeling?

150
00:14:41.352 --> 00:14:43.210
And what does Boudica mean?

151
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:44.817
She was a Trinovante queen.

152
00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.148
Mother’s an Iceni queen?

153
00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:48.391
Your mother’s a Trinovante

154
00:14:48.392 --> 00:14:50.294
who became an Iceni queen.

155
00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:52.296
To these people, that marks her

156
00:14:52.297 --> 00:14:53.958
more powerful than
the Roman Emperor.

157
00:14:55.058 --> 00:14:56.631
She’s like a god to them!

158
00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:01.702
Did your slave just speak ill
of the Emperor?

159
00:15:03.066 --> 00:15:04.605
She meant nothing by it.

160
00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:07.234
She’s a servant, not a slave.

161
00:15:07.235 --> 00:15:10.446
Are you something special
to these joke barbarians?

162
00:15:10.447 --> 00:15:13.548
Vagrants who get fat
on Roman tributes.

163
00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:15.979
It appears you know
more than I, sir.

164
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.915
I don’t know who they are.

165
00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:19.686
Come along, children.

166
00:15:19.687 --> 00:15:21.589
Your slave made
a disparaging remark

167
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.052
about the Emperor.

168
00:15:23.053 --> 00:15:24.185
I’m sorry.

169
00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:25.957
A queen can afford some wine.

170
00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.959
Or the Roman auxiliary

171
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.533
can hear about your slave’s
rebellious nature.

172
00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:33.733
You’ve really gone too far now!

173
00:15:33.734 --> 00:15:35.372
We have to find your father!

174
00:15:35.373 --> 00:15:38.200
You’re not going anywhere!
Find a legionarius!

175
00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:44.481
Aaargh!

176
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.060
Go!

177
00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:12.168
Do you want
to know what I did today?

178
00:16:13.103 --> 00:16:16.347
I stood in front of
a room full of centurions

179
00:16:16.348 --> 00:16:18.680
and had to swear that my wife

180
00:16:19.384 --> 00:16:22.947
was a civil and gentle soul.

181
00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:24.388
A wonderful mother,

182
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:28.084
who just simply loves to weave.

183
00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:32.253
I said and did
nothing to provoke them.

184
00:16:32.254 --> 00:16:33.321
I promise.

185
00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:41.262
I negotiated
and bargained more today,

186
00:16:41.263 --> 00:16:43.672
and with more passion,
than I’ve had to do in years.

187
00:16:46.103 --> 00:16:48.170
It was really quite thrilling.

188
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:49.480
However...

189
00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:52.009
I do not wish to do it again,

190
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.011
so we will send
servants into town

191
00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:55.617
next time you want
something special.

192
00:16:55.618 --> 00:16:57.752
Like a blue robe.

193
00:16:58.918 --> 00:17:00.755
At least for the
next year or so.

194
00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:06.695
Tell me, what does it mean?

195
00:17:07.355 --> 00:17:08.762
Boudica...

196
00:17:08.763 --> 00:17:09.994
Mm-hm?

197
00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:11.633
She was a Trinovante legend

198
00:17:11.634 --> 00:17:13.360
before the time of the Druids.

199
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:14.834
A fierce goddess.

200
00:17:14.835 --> 00:17:17.838
A proud warrior people
that were too...

201
00:17:18.872 --> 00:17:20.708
stubborn to negotiate.

202
00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:24.206
And some believe
she will come again,

203
00:17:24.207 --> 00:17:25.944
to free us from the Romans.

204
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.045
Why me?

205
00:17:30.884 --> 00:17:32.555
My love.

206
00:17:32.556 --> 00:17:36.120
You and I were married
when we were young.

207
00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.793
You have a proud lineage.

208
00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:43.094
There’s barbarian blood

209
00:17:44.293 --> 00:17:45.503
that drives your heart,

210
00:17:46.702 --> 00:17:48.538
and they can see that.

211
00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:50.772
It’s impossible to hide
it from those people.

212
00:17:52.675 --> 00:17:54.368
Because they look at you
and they see

213
00:17:54.369 --> 00:17:56.238
what you have
achieved with your life.

214
00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:57.482
It incites them.

215
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:59.912
Fills them full of hope.

216
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.618
Is that a bad thing?

217
00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:07.491
It might scare the Romans
is all that I am saying.

218
00:18:07.492 --> 00:18:12.419
So I wish for you to stay here
and avoid town and barbarians,

219
00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.389
at least for a few weeks.

220
00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:16.533
Of course.

221
00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:18.932
Of course.

222
00:18:20.736 --> 00:18:23.232
You’re gonna have
to keep me prisoner.

223
00:18:23.233 --> 00:18:24.333
Mmm.

224
00:18:25.433 --> 00:18:27.435
Ugh! Savages!

225
00:18:28.678 --> 00:18:30.305
You monsters! Aah!

226
00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:32.341
Don’t kill me!
Ha ha ha!

227
00:18:33.848 --> 00:18:35.916
Where’s the honey mead
you promised me, then?

228
00:18:37.379 --> 00:18:38.885
Then you wanted
to wash away the taste

229
00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:41.085
of that shitty Roman wine
you’ve been drinking?

230
00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:43.121
If it gets me drunk,
I’ll drink it.

231
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.697
So, finally, I’ve found my three
most fierce warriors!

232
00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:51.602
How are you boys
intimidated by our skill?

233
00:18:52.295 --> 00:18:53.428
Ugh!

234
00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:56.067
Get him!

235
00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:57.805
Oh, gotcha!

236
00:18:57.806 --> 00:19:01.403
Raargh, that’s what you get
for fighting a king!

237
00:19:02.514 --> 00:19:04.944
I’ll be back
at the Crannog, my liege.

238
00:19:04.945 --> 00:19:07.475
You can take my wild daughters
with you.

239
00:19:08.751 --> 00:19:11.314
- I want to speak with my queen.
- This way.

240
00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:17.319
What’s the matter with him?

241
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.761
When a man fights in a war

242
00:19:19.762 --> 00:19:21.928
and loses his family, his home.

243
00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:23.193
Ends up with nothing...

244
00:19:23.194 --> 00:19:26.295
Laughter and the sword
cease to go hand in hand.

245
00:19:26.296 --> 00:19:29.397
Should’ve seen

246
00:19:29.398 --> 00:19:31.839
the way that woman
used her sword.

247
00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.808
She was...
she was so impressive.

248
00:19:33.809 --> 00:19:35.173
She attacked...

249
00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:39.078
without hesitation.

250
00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:44.016
I’m not sure I want my daughters

251
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:45.986
to be Trinovante Brigante, though.

252
00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.825
Fighting. Never trusting anyone.

253
00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.290
None of them
live very long lives.

254
00:19:54.962 --> 00:19:57.734
To be able to defend oneself...

255
00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:59.394
Hm!

256
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:02.365
Cannot be a bad thing.

257
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.069
You...

258
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.403
You clearly have
Trinovante blood in your veins.

259
00:20:08.712 --> 00:20:10.945
Use that ferocity
in a thoughtful way.

260
00:20:12.683 --> 00:20:14.079
Not in a bloodthirsty one.

261
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.982
Mm-hmm.

262
00:20:15.983 --> 00:20:17.952
Use it to be the
best queen possible.

263
00:20:20.053 --> 00:20:21.483
Ha!

264
00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:25.728
Come get me!

265
00:20:25.729 --> 00:20:27.994
If you want to be a warrior

266
00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.293
a Trinovante warrior.

267
00:20:30.327 --> 00:20:32.460
Mmm.

268
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:33.561
Then let’s go home.

269
00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:36.168
Because I have something
to give you.

270
00:20:46.508 --> 00:20:48.620
It’s not really a gift from me.

271
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:52.414
It’s part of the dowry
given by your father,

272
00:20:52.415 --> 00:20:54.724
when I asked for
your hand in marriage.

273
00:20:54.725 --> 00:20:57.452
At the time I didn’t really
know what to do with it,

274
00:20:57.453 --> 00:20:59.795
but recent events have proven...

275
00:20:59.796 --> 00:21:03.129
It may well be possible
to leave your origins behind

276
00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:07.132
but I think your origins
will never leave you.

277
00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.529
Hmm.

278
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.707
What is it, father?

279
00:21:13.502 --> 00:21:16.274
Protected for centuries
by the ancient Druids,

280
00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.914
the Queen of the Furies...

281
00:21:19.882 --> 00:21:21.048
Boudica.

282
00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:32.763
Thank you, Father.
My king.

283
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:35.963
It is said that
the ancient smiths

284
00:21:35.964 --> 00:21:38.669
used forgotten magic
from the mountain mists

285
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.594
to forge blades like this.

286
00:21:40.595 --> 00:21:41.871
If you look closely,

287
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.136
you’ll see how the color changes

288
00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.434
with the flickering fire.

289
00:21:45.435 --> 00:21:48.074
As if the God spell
of the Earth itself

290
00:21:48.075 --> 00:21:49.637
is woven within its bronze.

291
00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:09.833
I love it.

292
00:22:14.937 --> 00:22:16.532
Perhaps
we rest the blade for now.

293
00:22:20.602 --> 00:22:21.944
Mother!

294
00:22:26.817 --> 00:22:28.818
What are you staring at?

295
00:22:28.819 --> 00:22:30.315
I don’t know.

296
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.548
A premonition, perhaps.

297
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:36.222
Good things, I hope?

298
00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:01.445
The Romans are here!

299
00:23:19.529 --> 00:23:21.201
Legions, attention!

300
00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:25.369
Make way for our
most esteemed procurator,

301
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.844
Catus Decianus!

302
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:29.605
Legion! Outward!

303
00:24:26.563 --> 00:24:29.433
My lord, this day the Iceni
welcomed you here.

304
00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:30.874
To our lands.

305
00:24:30.875 --> 00:24:33.008
Today, we pay tribute
to the Empire.

306
00:24:33.009 --> 00:24:35.209
Come. Go with us inside.

307
00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:45.615
Iurat capillos esse,

308
00:24:46.616 --> 00:24:48.518
quos emit, suos.

309
00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:51.389
Numquid illa,

310
00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.688
Paule, peierat?

311
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:59.365
Well done! They pleased you, no?

312
00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:05.766
Dare I presume to ask
whether they have Roman tutors?

313
00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:07.042
They do.

314
00:25:07.043 --> 00:25:09.143
I knew it!
I told you, Maximus,

315
00:25:09.144 --> 00:25:11.948
I told you that they had
Roman tutors for their children.

316
00:25:11.949 --> 00:25:13.543
When I was in Africa,

317
00:25:13.544 --> 00:25:15.919
I witnessed a dancing monkey

318
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.581
that had been taught
by a Roman tutor.

319
00:25:18.582 --> 00:25:20.616
They really are
the best in the world.

320
00:25:20.617 --> 00:25:22.519
They can teach anybody

321
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.927
the basics of culture.

322
00:25:23.928 --> 00:25:26.359
Even these barbarian children.

323
00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:32.200
How long do you intend to grace
us with your presence, my lord?

324
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.597
A year.

325
00:25:34.598 --> 00:25:35.907
Maybe two.

326
00:25:41.869 --> 00:25:43.507
We’ll leave in the morning.

327
00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:46.411
You need only feed
my small entourage

328
00:25:46.412 --> 00:25:47.874
from your supplies for tonight,

329
00:25:47.875 --> 00:25:50.250
and, uh, my pay convoy

330
00:25:50.251 --> 00:25:51.779
on the ides of each third month,

331
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.319
en route to Fallbrook Forest.

332
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.453
Don‘t worry,
my brittunculi friend.

333
00:25:55.454 --> 00:25:57.554
We haven’t come
to clean you out.

334
00:25:57.555 --> 00:26:00.689
Well, you’re welcome to stay
as long as you wish.

335
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.857
It is an honor to host you.

336
00:26:03.858 --> 00:26:05.497
So, tell me, Prasutagus...

337
00:26:06.971 --> 00:26:08.862
You built this fort yourself?

338
00:26:08.863 --> 00:26:12.272
No, it is a holding
handed down within my family.

339
00:26:12.273 --> 00:26:14.901
I have merely
improved upon it, and...

340
00:26:14.902 --> 00:26:18.575
will continue to maintain
it for our next generation.

341
00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:21.348
Then your family
stole it from someone.

342
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.119
Bought it, traded, or won it.

343
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.682
My ancestors had a reputation

344
00:26:26.683 --> 00:26:29.488
for avoiding violence
when necessary.

345
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:33.128
And I try to uphold
the same tradition.

346
00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:35.526
My king is the personification

347
00:26:35.527 --> 00:26:37.562
of the civilization
in this land.

348
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:47.011
Solid, bed-rock foundation!

349
00:26:48.507 --> 00:26:50.640
Arable land that you till

350
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:54.314
and keep fertile with manure
of the beasts that graze here.

351
00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:57.581
And, uh, soil that
does not hold damp,

352
00:26:57.582 --> 00:26:59.319
with the elevation water run-off

353
00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.947
and down-hill mitigation.

354
00:27:00.948 --> 00:27:04.886
And the view?
Well, unimpeded from all sides.

355
00:27:05.953 --> 00:27:07.558
I warrant that on a clear day

356
00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:10.133
you can see all the way
to the Watling road.

357
00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:12.464
You are correct.

358
00:27:12.465 --> 00:27:14.928
It’s no wonder that this fort

359
00:27:14.929 --> 00:27:18.305
has been so sought-after
this last millennium.

360
00:27:18.306 --> 00:27:20.638
My British king.

361
00:27:22.475 --> 00:27:25.049
We serve you well here, Lord.

362
00:27:26.644 --> 00:27:27.842
Yes.

363
00:27:27.843 --> 00:27:29.746
Yes indeed, you do.

364
00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:38.688
We’re going to have to be
very well-behaved Britons.

365
00:27:38.689 --> 00:27:42.428
This officious bastard could
royally fuck us if he chooses.

366
00:27:42.429 --> 00:27:44.298
We have to be smart about this.

367
00:27:44.299 --> 00:27:46.103
We make ourselves indispensable.

368
00:27:47.995 --> 00:27:52.471
You are...
Right. Of course.

369
00:27:52.472 --> 00:27:54.407
Now, ready the guards to leave.

370
00:27:54.408 --> 00:27:57.047
We’ll run raiding parties
for a few days.

371
00:27:57.048 --> 00:27:59.643
Round up any bandits,
cattle thieves, undesirables,

372
00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.910
and we’ll send those
to Catus Decianus as a tribute.

373
00:28:03.516 --> 00:28:05.154
Knowing these lands
are dangerous

374
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:08.059
might temper his desires
to settle here.

375
00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:13.228
You’re a wise man, my lord.

376
00:28:13.229 --> 00:28:15.395
I’ll ride with the party.

377
00:28:15.396 --> 00:28:16.991
Exercise will do me good.

378
00:28:27.969 --> 00:28:30.179
I have such a thirst
for you, woman!

379
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:34.480
A dryness in my soul
that only you can quench.

380
00:28:34.481 --> 00:28:35.943
Mother, Father!

381
00:28:35.944 --> 00:28:37.813
Oh, school is over?

382
00:28:37.814 --> 00:28:39.188
Yes.

383
00:28:39.189 --> 00:28:40.420
I need to take
a good look at you.

384
00:28:40.421 --> 00:28:42.686
Now you need to promise me

385
00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:44.887
that you will always stay
by your mother’s side.

386
00:28:45.987 --> 00:28:47.053
Promise?

387
00:28:47.054 --> 00:28:48.230
Promise.

388
00:28:48.231 --> 00:28:50.464
All three of you, stay warm.

389
00:28:51.465 --> 00:28:52.565
I promise.

390
00:28:54.831 --> 00:28:57.174
And I need you to know
that I love you.

391
00:28:58.142 --> 00:28:59.572
And I always will.

392
00:29:04.544 --> 00:29:05.743
I love you too.

393
00:30:12.942 --> 00:30:15.516
The men are back!
Close the gate!

394
00:30:51.981 --> 00:30:53.180
Aaargh!

395
00:31:35.332 --> 00:31:37.532
Long live the
Queen of the Iceni.

396
00:33:18.468 --> 00:33:21.196
All hail Caesar Augustus Nero!

397
00:33:23.473 --> 00:33:25.442
Hail, Catus Decianus.

398
00:33:26.608 --> 00:33:27.806
Please join us.

399
00:33:27.807 --> 00:33:29.610
I shall not stay...

400
00:33:29.611 --> 00:33:31.480
I feel my presence

401
00:33:31.481 --> 00:33:35.111
weighs heavily on the mood
of the locals.

402
00:33:36.618 --> 00:33:39.686
You read too much
into simple curiosity.

403
00:33:39.687 --> 00:33:41.557
Did you receive my tribute?

404
00:33:42.217 --> 00:33:44.955
Yes. I did.

405
00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.254
And I thank you.

406
00:33:47.288 --> 00:33:48.794
You have bequeathed

407
00:33:48.795 --> 00:33:51.765
half of your holdings
and lands to me.

408
00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:56.868
’Tis a most
generous acquiescence.

409
00:33:56.869 --> 00:33:59.102
I’m glad
his lordship is satisfied.

410
00:34:00.136 --> 00:34:01.709
Oh, I have not said that.

411
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:07.142
As a woman, Rome cannot

412
00:34:07.143 --> 00:34:11.884
and will not
recognize you as queen.

413
00:34:14.689 --> 00:34:17.428
No female is recognized
as worthy

414
00:34:18.253 --> 00:34:20.387
of any position
of governing power.

415
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:24.159
To do so is a rebuke
against Rome,

416
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.326
Senate, and Empire!

417
00:34:26.327 --> 00:34:29.230
And a personal indignity
to the Emperor.

418
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:31.771
To try and bribe me

419
00:34:31.772 --> 00:34:36.039
into turning a blind eye
to this wanton ridicule,

420
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.404
this perversion of our laws,

421
00:34:38.405 --> 00:34:40.076
is a crime!

422
00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:43.278
One that begs
to be punished to the full.

423
00:34:44.114 --> 00:34:45.455
I don’t understand you.

424
00:34:45.456 --> 00:34:47.347
Well then let me make it simple

425
00:34:47.348 --> 00:34:49.492
for your barbarian brain
to ingest...

426
00:34:49.493 --> 00:34:54.530
I shall not be taking half
of your holdings and lands.

427
00:34:54.531 --> 00:34:57.863
All of your kingdom.

428
00:34:57.864 --> 00:35:01.504
And you will be flogged.

429
00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:04.936
A fate shared by your children,

430
00:35:04.937 --> 00:35:06.433
while you watch.

431
00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.612
Oh, you look to Ciaran!

432
00:35:10.646 --> 00:35:14.550
The man who told me
where you husband would be

433
00:35:14.551 --> 00:35:16.245
the day he was killed.

434
00:35:18.555 --> 00:35:23.351
Roman gold will make a convert
of the weak and covetous.

435
00:35:27.124 --> 00:35:30.258
Stand... down!

436
00:35:30.259 --> 00:35:31.634
No, please!

437
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.175
Appointed by the Empire,

438
00:35:46.176 --> 00:35:49.047
bequeathed
by the Emperor himself,

439
00:35:49.751 --> 00:35:51.917
my word is law

440
00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:54.118
as if spoken by Nero!

441
00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:58.990
Henceforth, all land
and properties

442
00:35:58.991 --> 00:36:04.292
owned by Prasutagus of Iceni

443
00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:05.360
are mine!

444
00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:09.232
Hail Nero.

445
00:36:19.143 --> 00:36:20.749
Aaaaah!

446
00:36:27.657 --> 00:36:30.055
Don’t you dare touch her!

447
00:36:34.631 --> 00:36:36.600
Noooo! Aaaaah!

448
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.906
This was a gift from Nero.

449
00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:48.777
One holds it into fire

450
00:36:49.844 --> 00:36:51.614
then pushes it onto the face

451
00:36:51.615 --> 00:36:56.509
of any misbehaving slave,
thus branding them his property.

452
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.719
N. R.

453
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.887
Nero Rex Dramus.

454
00:37:00.888 --> 00:37:02.317
A-Although, in your case,

455
00:37:02.318 --> 00:37:04.188
the N. R. could stand for

456
00:37:04.518 --> 00:37:06.454
Nec Regina.

457
00:37:07.191 --> 00:37:08.291
Queen no more.

458
00:37:09.358 --> 00:37:12.734
Any disruptive brittunculi

459
00:37:12.735 --> 00:37:14.197
looking to you

460
00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:16.804
will see this mark, laugh,

461
00:37:16.805 --> 00:37:19.533
and be reminded
of your falsehood.

462
00:37:26.375 --> 00:37:27.783
Ohhh...

463
00:37:29.653 --> 00:37:31.985
The illicit smell
of burning flesh.

464
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:56.101
Shh, shh, shh.

465
00:38:56.102 --> 00:38:58.401
Quiet. You must come with us.

466
00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:41.146
Die here.

467
00:39:41.147 --> 00:39:43.083
We have to keep moving.

468
00:40:28.524 --> 00:40:31.758
Mmm... Girls?

469
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:35.971
Girls?

470
00:40:43.572 --> 00:40:45.178
Where are my daughters?

471
00:40:46.707 --> 00:40:48.048
Where are my daughters?

472
00:40:48.049 --> 00:40:49.182
Shhh.

473
00:40:52.416 --> 00:40:54.351
Were they hurt?

474
00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:56.222
Where are my daughters?

475
00:40:58.587 --> 00:41:00.292
Woah, woah, woah.

476
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.935
Ugh! Oh, I forgot.

477
00:41:07.035 --> 00:41:08.234
Ohhh.

478
00:41:11.039 --> 00:41:13.173
I can’t understand
what happened.

479
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:16.076
You must bring them.

480
00:41:16.077 --> 00:41:18.144
You must bring them, I...

481
00:41:18.145 --> 00:41:19.475
I want to hug them.

482
00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.544
Where are my children?

483
00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:27.814
We... are your children, Boudica.

484
00:41:45.106 --> 00:41:46.910
I need to see my girls.

485
00:41:52.179 --> 00:41:54.741
- There you are, Mother!
- Mother, darling!

486
00:41:54.742 --> 00:41:56.711
Oh! Babies!

487
00:42:01.815 --> 00:42:03.894
My babies!

488
00:42:10.065 --> 00:42:11.429
I’m so sorry!

489
00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:16.103
I’m so, so sorry.

490
00:42:16.104 --> 00:42:18.403
I couldn’t protect you.

491
00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.275
You know...
I fought so hard.

492
00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:26.950
I tried everything.

493
00:42:28.545 --> 00:42:30.744
It’s all right, Mother.

494
00:42:30.745 --> 00:42:32.582
We’re here with you now.

495
00:42:39.886 --> 00:42:41.063
For your mouth.

496
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.893
- What?
- For teeth.

497
00:42:53.669 --> 00:42:56.473
She says a warrior
must be able to bite.

498
00:42:56.474 --> 00:43:00.147
She stole it from
the mouth of a dead centurion.

499
00:43:00.148 --> 00:43:01.808
Ohhh...

500
00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:04.250
So happy.

501
00:43:04.251 --> 00:43:06.516
You must eat.

502
00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:09.421
She is a warrior.
And a soothsayer.

503
00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.885
She says that
you are to be queen.

504
00:43:12.886 --> 00:43:15.625
That your task is
to kill the Romans.

505
00:43:16.923 --> 00:43:18.430
We are here to help you, Mother.

506
00:43:20.003 --> 00:43:21.466
My babies.

507
00:43:23.105 --> 00:43:24.568
My babies!

508
00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:29.078
You must eat.

509
00:43:57.898 --> 00:43:59.404
What are you learning?

510
00:43:59.405 --> 00:44:01.967
We learn how to use weapons.

511
00:44:01.968 --> 00:44:04.178
Must a Trinovante woman fight?

512
00:44:04.179 --> 00:44:06.543
A Trinovante woman
can do anything.

513
00:44:06.544 --> 00:44:07.974
Best of all, they fight.

514
00:44:09.745 --> 00:44:11.779
Can I spend some time
with you, my dears?

515
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.321
It feels like
I’ve seen nothing of you.

516
00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:17.456
Mmm...

517
00:44:21.922 --> 00:44:25.068
- I’m sorry I’ve disturbed you.
- You haven’t.

518
00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:28.334
Is there anything I can get
for you, my queen?

519
00:44:28.335 --> 00:44:30.600
I’ve got everything
I need right now.

520
00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:32.075
But thank you.

521
00:44:36.002 --> 00:44:38.003
She’s looked after you well.

522
00:44:38.004 --> 00:44:40.280
She is our friend, Mother.

523
00:44:40.281 --> 00:44:41.512
Where are her children?

524
00:44:41.513 --> 00:44:43.481
The Romans killed her children.

525
00:44:43.482 --> 00:44:46.484
She had daughters. Like us.

526
00:44:46.485 --> 00:44:48.618
These people want you
to be their queen.

527
00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.851
They say you’re chosen.
It’s an honor.

528
00:44:50.852 --> 00:44:53.128
Oh no, I wasn’t chosen.

529
00:44:53.129 --> 00:44:54.657
I was double-crossed
and betrayed,

530
00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:57.066
and my people let this happen!

531
00:44:57.067 --> 00:44:59.068
No, they mean that
Catus chose you.

532
00:44:59.069 --> 00:45:00.862
When he branded you.

533
00:45:02.435 --> 00:45:03.765
No, this...

534
00:45:03.766 --> 00:45:06.372
It’s a mark of humiliation.

535
00:45:06.373 --> 00:45:08.869
To the Trinovante,
you have been anointed.

536
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:11.036
It is our duty
to bring the tribes together.

537
00:45:11.037 --> 00:45:13.775
To kill the Romans.

538
00:45:13.776 --> 00:45:16.151
Do you remember what
Catus ordered his men to do?

539
00:45:16.152 --> 00:45:17.845
In front of your friends,
your family?

540
00:45:17.846 --> 00:45:20.155
Oh I do, I do.
I’m sorry.

541
00:45:20.156 --> 00:45:22.422
I’m really, really sorry.

542
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.162
You were the Queen of Iceni.

543
00:45:27.163 --> 00:45:28.823
Are the Queen of Iceni.

544
00:45:28.824 --> 00:45:31.562
These people need you now
more than ever.

545
00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:33.301
You really have no choice.

546
00:45:42.244 --> 00:45:43.871
Wait!

547
00:45:43.872 --> 00:45:45.247
I’ll show you.

548
00:45:46.545 --> 00:45:49.482
Neck, under the arm.

549
00:45:50.483 --> 00:45:51.583
Wrist.

550
00:45:52.848 --> 00:45:54.321
Stomach will stop,

551
00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:55.883
but it won’t kill.

552
00:45:55.884 --> 00:45:58.721
This is where most
wear their armor thickest.

553
00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:01.526
Neck, under the arm,

554
00:46:01.527 --> 00:46:03.462
under the armor.

555
00:46:03.463 --> 00:46:05.398
These’ll be your targets.

556
00:46:05.399 --> 00:46:06.499
Show me.

557
00:46:07.962 --> 00:46:09.897
Neck!

558
00:46:09.898 --> 00:46:12.901
- Ooh! Wah!
- Yes.

559
00:46:17.004 --> 00:46:18.247
This is for you.

560
00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.197
Where did you get this?

561
00:46:35.396 --> 00:46:37.364
Catus gave it to a Roman.

562
00:46:37.365 --> 00:46:38.695
I killed him.

563
00:46:38.696 --> 00:46:40.368
And now it is yours again.

564
00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.177
Don’t cry, Mother.

565
00:46:48.178 --> 00:46:49.640
We can’t show weakness.

566
00:46:49.641 --> 00:46:52.874
Bronze is the metal of the past.

567
00:46:52.875 --> 00:46:54.249
It won’t hold an edge.

568
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.811
Heavy and unwieldy.

569
00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.747
More dangerous to its owner
than its enemy.

570
00:46:57.748 --> 00:46:59.947
Not this blade.
Not to me.

571
00:46:59.948 --> 00:47:02.192
Who’s using my training area?

572
00:47:10.431 --> 00:47:14.093
You’re the Iceni queen that’s
come to save us, aren’t you?

573
00:47:14.094 --> 00:47:15.666
They call her Boudica.

574
00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:19.637
- That’s a bold name.
- I did not choose it.

575
00:47:19.638 --> 00:47:22.167
I see the brand on your face,

576
00:47:22.168 --> 00:47:25.841
and I’ve, uh, seen
what a cat-of-nine-tails

577
00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.645
does to a man’s back.

578
00:47:27.646 --> 00:47:30.780
But how does that qualify you
to lead the Trinovante?

579
00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:33.883
Why should you be leader
and not me?

580
00:47:36.017 --> 00:47:37.425
I’m just Boudica.

581
00:47:38.987 --> 00:47:41.263
I fought as an auxiliary
for the Romans.

582
00:47:41.264 --> 00:47:43.188
So I know how they train,

583
00:47:43.189 --> 00:47:46.026
how they tool up,
how they fight.

584
00:47:46.027 --> 00:47:47.192
How they think.

585
00:47:47.193 --> 00:47:50.272
Now I’m a deserter,
marked for death.

586
00:47:50.273 --> 00:47:52.197
As are all my men!

587
00:47:52.198 --> 00:47:53.671
But I’ve returned...

588
00:47:53.672 --> 00:47:56.938
to lead my people
out of Roman bondage.

589
00:47:56.939 --> 00:47:58.875
So you’d best step aside.

590
00:48:07.488 --> 00:48:12.360
Is that what you’re going
to challenge the Romans with?

591
00:48:12.361 --> 00:48:14.054
Bronze was good,

592
00:48:14.055 --> 00:48:15.694
when that was all we had.

593
00:48:16.398 --> 00:48:17.597
Iron...

594
00:48:18.697 --> 00:48:20.699
That’s the way
of modern warfare.

595
00:48:22.063 --> 00:48:23.229
May I?

596
00:48:36.176 --> 00:48:37.484
By the gods,

597
00:48:37.485 --> 00:48:38.881
it’s ugly in the hand,

598
00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:41.489
heavy, imbalanced.

599
00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.590
There’s no life to it.

600
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:46.218
That’s why we don’t use
bronze anymore.

601
00:48:46.219 --> 00:48:47.660
Let me do you a favor!

602
00:48:50.157 --> 00:48:51.763
Huh!

603
00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:56.834
What?

604
00:48:57.802 --> 00:49:00.903
What? I did you a favor!

605
00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:02.004
Where is she?

606
00:49:06.206 --> 00:49:07.712
That blade was shit.

607
00:49:07.713 --> 00:49:09.682
Any real warrior
would know that.

608
00:49:18.394 --> 00:49:20.054
There’s strong currents
in there.

609
00:49:20.055 --> 00:49:22.254
Strong enough to hold a man
down and drown him.

610
00:49:22.255 --> 00:49:25.697
Now I feel responsible.
Should I go in?

611
00:49:25.698 --> 00:49:26.864
What’s so interesting?

612
00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:33.804
Maybe this sword chooses
who it performs for.

613
00:49:33.805 --> 00:49:35.674
How did you reshape the blade?

614
00:49:35.675 --> 00:49:37.875
This is how I found it.

615
00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.614
This should be interesting.

616
00:49:51.559 --> 00:49:53.626
I was an archer in Armenia,

617
00:49:53.627 --> 00:49:55.859
tracker for Galba in Spain,

618
00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:57.532
swordsman for Rome.

619
00:49:59.325 --> 00:50:00.963
In all of my years
living by the sword

620
00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:03.570
I’ve never seen anything
like this before.

621
00:50:03.571 --> 00:50:05.737
Our people asked
the gods of the land

622
00:50:05.738 --> 00:50:07.475
to provide us a leader,

623
00:50:07.476 --> 00:50:08.873
and now they have!

624
00:50:11.337 --> 00:50:12.547
Queen Boudica...

625
00:50:14.846 --> 00:50:16.177
Kneel.

626
00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:18.343
Accept me,

627
00:50:18.344 --> 00:50:21.083
and my men,
as your loyal servants.

628
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:57.690
I was happy being
a collaborator,

629
00:50:57.691 --> 00:50:58.890
and a wife.

630
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:04.027
Now...

631
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:06.732
those two girls are...

632
00:51:06.733 --> 00:51:11.573
the only trace of the old me.

633
00:51:13.938 --> 00:51:15.643
You think I can do this?

634
00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:22.716
You’re the only one who can.

635
00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.149
Yeah.

636
00:51:35.223 --> 00:51:38.226
Forged
by Catuvellauni craftsmen...

637
00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:41.602
before the time
of the Trinovante

638
00:51:41.603 --> 00:51:42.999
or the Iceni.

639
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.805
The symbol of your royalty...

640
00:51:47.906 --> 00:51:52.713
stolen by the invaders from Rome
and returned to you now.

641
00:51:54.374 --> 00:51:58.554
Do you choose
the royal torque, Boudica?

642
00:52:00.754 --> 00:52:02.381
Put it on.

643
00:52:02.382 --> 00:52:05.319
You must choose it.
It’s yours.

644
00:52:08.729 --> 00:52:11.929
In the name
of the four kings of Kent,

645
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.503
Queen Boudica!

646
00:52:14.504 --> 00:52:18.299
Boudica!

647
00:52:19.542 --> 00:52:24.645
I am Boudica.
You are my people.

648
00:52:24.646 --> 00:52:27.011
We are in a time
of extreme peril.

649
00:52:28.815 --> 00:52:31.586
We fight for our freedom!

650
00:52:31.587 --> 00:52:32.983
Yes!

651
00:52:32.984 --> 00:52:35.117
Honor!
Yes!

652
00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:37.152
The Romans fight for pay.

653
00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.560
We know that the Romans are paid

654
00:52:38.561 --> 00:52:40.628
on the ides
of every third month.

655
00:52:40.629 --> 00:52:42.322
In two days’ time,

656
00:52:42.323 --> 00:52:44.599
Catus Decianus
will lead a pay convoy

657
00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.569
from Londinium to Venonis
and then to Eboracum.

658
00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:52.497
That will lead him straight
through Fallbrook Forest.

659
00:52:52.498 --> 00:52:54.577
Where we shall ambush him.

660
00:52:56.975 --> 00:53:00.407
Catus Decianus has
a centurie of 80 men,

661
00:53:01.617 --> 00:53:04.652
Batavian auxiliaries marching
with him at all times,

662
00:53:04.653 --> 00:53:07.314
along with mounted Equites
and Galician mercenaries.

663
00:53:07.315 --> 00:53:10.988
He will destroy any ambush
you set. Any ambush.

664
00:53:10.989 --> 00:53:12.924
It’s a perfect setup.

665
00:53:12.925 --> 00:53:16.829
The Romans have been plundering
our gold for 20 years!

666
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:19.260
I think it’s time
to take it back.

667
00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:20.196
Yes!

668
00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:22.604
We must plan a war!

669
00:53:22.605 --> 00:53:26.267
Wolfgar, if you’re not
behind me in Fallbrook Forest,

670
00:53:26.268 --> 00:53:29.534
I will fight Catus alone.

671
00:53:29.535 --> 00:53:31.075
But I will fight him.

672
00:53:32.142 --> 00:53:34.375
You’re as mad as a March hare.

673
00:53:35.244 --> 00:53:39.050
No. I’m as clear-headed
as I’ve ever been.

674
00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:47.861
I need to know
if you are with me.

675
00:54:12.545 --> 00:54:13.854
Give me my sword.

676
00:54:20.696 --> 00:54:22.258
Thank you.

677
00:54:29.067 --> 00:54:31.267
Was I the only one who saw that?

678
00:54:44.544 --> 00:54:47.690
Our world is...
full of signs.

679
00:54:51.419 --> 00:54:52.992
She must be the one.

680
00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:01.671
You don’t approve, huh?

681
00:55:03.805 --> 00:55:06.301
Your silence speaks volumes.

682
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:09.173
You ask a lot
of a simple people.

683
00:55:10.636 --> 00:55:12.373
When opportunity
presents itself,

684
00:55:12.374 --> 00:55:13.913
we must seize it.

685
00:55:13.914 --> 00:55:16.817
And Catus in the forest
is an opportunity.

686
00:55:16.818 --> 00:55:18.380
Did I do wrong?

687
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:21.151
You should not act so willfully.

688
00:55:21.152 --> 00:55:23.824
They call me queen.

689
00:55:23.825 --> 00:55:25.959
And then they question my plan.

690
00:55:26.927 --> 00:55:30.523
It’s OK. We’ll do this
on our own, girls.

691
00:55:30.524 --> 00:55:31.833
Look behind you, Mother.

692
00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:49.883
What they say about you
cannot be more true.

693
00:55:49.884 --> 00:55:52.348
We have chosen you as our queen.

694
00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.547
Boudica!

695
00:55:54.548 --> 00:55:57.122
Boudica! Boudica!

696
00:56:32.718 --> 00:56:35.127
Step off the road, brittunculi.

697
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.231
Who the fuck are you talking to?

698
00:56:41.133 --> 00:56:43.663
Halt!

699
00:56:44.532 --> 00:56:46.138
You, peasant...

700
00:56:56.544 --> 00:56:57.852
You were dead.

701
00:56:57.853 --> 00:56:59.216
I’m your queen.

702
00:56:59.217 --> 00:57:01.989
Or has your ambition
blinded you?

703
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.586
My queen.

704
00:57:12.901 --> 00:57:16.167
I don’t know how
or why you’re here,

705
00:57:16.168 --> 00:57:18.400
but you must leave now.

706
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.874
I am queen,

707
00:57:19.875 --> 00:57:22.074
and I’d like to speak
to your regent,

708
00:57:22.075 --> 00:57:24.341
Catus Decianus.

709
00:57:25.672 --> 00:57:27.376
If you don’t go now,

710
00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:30.248
he will crucify you this time.

711
00:57:32.448 --> 00:57:33.679
Send word.

712
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.486
The queen of the Iceni
wishes to parlay.

713
00:57:38.828 --> 00:57:40.290
If you don’t tell him,

714
00:57:40.291 --> 00:57:42.292
he’ll have you whipped like me.

715
00:57:42.293 --> 00:57:44.592
I guarantee you that.

716
00:57:45.494 --> 00:57:46.627
Hm.

717
00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:54.173
Take a good look!

718
00:57:55.372 --> 00:57:58.275
If you live to have children,

719
00:57:58.276 --> 00:57:59.849
they’ll ask about me.

720
00:58:01.609 --> 00:58:04.413
Where is this brittunculi queen

721
00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:07.648
who would dare stop my cohort?

722
00:58:10.387 --> 00:58:13.994
Well... Speak, she-dog.

723
00:58:13.995 --> 00:58:18.196
I’m upset you don’t
recognize me, dear Catus,

724
00:58:18.197 --> 00:58:21.299
or has time been
so unkind to me?

725
00:58:23.906 --> 00:58:26.039
She is clearly insane.

726
00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.667
Remove and pillar her head

727
00:58:27.668 --> 00:58:32.177
and don’t stop us
on such trivialities again!

728
00:58:32.178 --> 00:58:35.774
I’m Queen Boudica
of the Iceni and the Trinovante,

729
00:58:35.775 --> 00:58:39.317
the Celts, the Saxons,
of the northern Britons!

730
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:45.322
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

731
00:58:45.323 --> 00:58:48.292
And it will take
a lot more than your blood

732
00:58:48.293 --> 00:58:50.525
to cleanse the foulness
you inflicted

733
00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:52.626
on me and my daughters!

734
00:58:52.627 --> 00:58:55.662
Catus Decianus.

735
00:58:55.663 --> 00:58:57.972
Yeah. Come closer,

736
00:58:57.973 --> 00:59:00.206
and have a good look at my face.

737
00:59:01.042 --> 00:59:03.044
Something you remember?

738
00:59:06.377 --> 00:59:07.774
Bou-di-ca.

739
00:59:10.513 --> 00:59:13.681
Nec Regina!

740
00:59:15.155 --> 00:59:18.685
Your scar has healed.

741
00:59:18.686 --> 00:59:24.229
My men prefer to train
with live targets!

742
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.462
Perhaps I shall grant them
that privilege.

743
00:59:26.463 --> 00:59:27.937
Now, my children.

744
00:59:30.797 --> 00:59:32.073
What witchery is this?

745
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.416
He was hiding in the woods.

746
01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:06.616
Aaah!

747
01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:09.785
Hail, Queen Boudica!

748
01:03:11.017 --> 01:03:12.293
You traitor!

749
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:19.861
You traitor! Traitor!

750
01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:23.095
Traitor!

751
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:28.034
You were supposed
to protect him.

752
01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:34.039
Enough! It’s over!

753
01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:36.217
It’s over.

754
01:03:36.218 --> 01:03:39.220
We won the day.
It’s over.

755
01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:42.256
We won the day.

756
01:03:42.257 --> 01:03:45.589
Boudica, my queen.
It’s over.

757
01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:48.296
It’s not over
until every Roman has gone.

758
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.858
My queen?

759
01:03:50.859 --> 01:03:53.201
We ride for Camulos.

760
01:03:53.202 --> 01:03:56.204
Governor Paulinus is still
biding his time in Rome.

761
01:03:56.205 --> 01:03:57.700
The last I’ve heard,

762
01:03:57.701 --> 01:03:59.438
his Gemina Legion
was mopping up Druids

763
01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:02.342
in Anglesey, so...
The timing is perfect.

764
01:04:02.343 --> 01:04:05.071
It will need a blessing
from the Druid council.

765
01:04:06.039 --> 01:04:07.414
You’ll see to it.

766
01:04:09.218 --> 01:04:10.582
You’re serious.

767
01:04:12.012 --> 01:04:14.145
And I suspect a little mental.

768
01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:15.488
My queen.

769
01:04:17.523 --> 01:04:19.525
But war favors the possessed.

770
01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:22.924
Where are you going?

771
01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.498
I reckon I’m going
to the Druid council

772
01:04:26.499 --> 01:04:29.193
to try to find a reason for a...

773
01:04:29.194 --> 01:04:31.537
Celtic Trinovante invasion
of Camulos.

774
01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.034
You are indeed.

775
01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:36.938
Yeah.

776
01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:10.234
When you drink from the skull
of Catus Decianus,

777
01:05:10.235 --> 01:05:12.281
your victory is complete.

778
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:14.613
It’s a tradition.

779
01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:36.304
There has of late
been a succession of ill omens

780
01:05:36.305 --> 01:05:38.702
for the Roman occupation force.

781
01:05:38.703 --> 01:05:42.200
Where they predict
misfortune for Nero,

782
01:05:42.201 --> 01:05:45.105
they promise fortune
for Brittania.

783
01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:47.448
And her queen...

784
01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.044
Boudica.

785
01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:58.018
The council supports your cause.

786
01:05:58.019 --> 01:06:00.955
Us.

787
01:06:00.956 --> 01:06:02.958
There’s nothing
we cannot achieve.

788
01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.801
You’re staring at me.

789
01:06:11.802 --> 01:06:13.639
You have your hand on my knee.

790
01:06:17.104 --> 01:06:18.303
Oh.

791
01:06:21.647 --> 01:06:23.241
Twenty years of killing enemies

792
01:06:23.242 --> 01:06:24.848
and chasing their wives.

793
01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:27.916
Forgive me, my queen.

794
01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.489
You’re forgiven.

795
01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:32.250
But if you ever
touch me like that again,

796
01:06:32.251 --> 01:06:34.285
I’ll kill you
before your little man

797
01:06:34.286 --> 01:06:36.287
has had a chance
to raise himself.

798
01:06:36.288 --> 01:06:37.794
By god, woman,

799
01:06:37.795 --> 01:06:40.863
if I didn’t already have
two wives...

800
01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:44.571
You have
a way with words, Wolfgar.

801
01:06:47.838 --> 01:06:49.070
No one would judge us.

802
01:06:51.006 --> 01:06:54.680
Two warrior leaders,
a man and a woman,

803
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:57.946
forged together
like charcoal and iron

804
01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.389
to become steel
in the furnace of war.

805
01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.954
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

806
01:07:07.154 --> 01:07:08.430
Please leave.

807
01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:26.370
You’ve come far, Queen Boudica.

808
01:07:26.371 --> 01:07:29.550
Life is impermanent.

809
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:31.518
Transitory.

810
01:07:31.519 --> 01:07:36.457
We all die.
You. Your daughters.

811
01:07:36.458 --> 01:07:39.955
What do my daughters have
to do with this?

812
01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:43.222
They’re in your mind,
as you survived.

813
01:07:43.223 --> 01:07:44.531
They did not.

814
01:07:44.532 --> 01:07:46.566
No. They’re here.

815
01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:50.472
Like snowflakes in the air.

816
01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:53.574
So beautiful to watch.

817
01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.236
Snatch one in your hand.

818
01:07:58.073 --> 01:07:59.404
And when you look...

819
01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.747
It will be gone.

820
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:07.984
Like goosebumps,
the first breath of winter.

821
01:08:09.249 --> 01:08:11.790
They will always be
with you, Boudica.

822
01:08:12.626 --> 01:08:13.792
As spirits.

823
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:18.357
Love what you can.

824
01:08:19.633 --> 01:08:22.196
Never forget
what it is that you love.

825
01:08:23.428 --> 01:08:25.067
As it defines you.

826
01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.301
I want to die.

827
01:08:29.302 --> 01:08:30.545
You will.

828
01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:34.515
But first, you must lead
your army again.

829
01:08:34.516 --> 01:08:39.488
The Druid council have
sanctioned your ride to Camulos.

830
01:08:41.787 --> 01:08:42.985
What if I refuse?

831
01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:45.757
You’re free to do as you wish.

832
01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:47.925
There are no rules
in this world.

833
01:08:49.124 --> 01:08:52.501
Except what death has put there.

834
01:09:16.415 --> 01:09:19.055
Queen. You must rest.

835
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:23.256
Tell me...

836
01:09:23.257 --> 01:09:24.599
Do you see them?

837
01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:26.667
Do you see my daughters?

838
01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:30.329
They’re... good girls.

839
01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:31.704
They behave well.

840
01:09:31.705 --> 01:09:32.804
They’ve been waiting for you.

841
01:09:32.805 --> 01:09:34.774
No, I asked, do you see them?

842
01:09:36.336 --> 01:09:37.501
See them?

843
01:09:37.502 --> 01:09:40.010
We see them
in our hearts, Queen.

844
01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.194
You need to wake up, Mother.

845
01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:07.432
If you attack Camulos,
the Romans will come after you.

846
01:10:07.433 --> 01:10:09.710
They will send archers
to destroy you.

847
01:10:14.979 --> 01:10:17.013
I will kill whoever they send.

848
01:10:17.014 --> 01:10:20.754
And find where they live
and kill their families.

849
01:10:21.986 --> 01:10:23.514
You must do it, Mother.

850
01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:26.254
For us. For Father.

851
01:10:27.992 --> 01:10:29.729
This would not have happened,

852
01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:32.095
had I not chosen to be queen.

853
01:10:33.393 --> 01:10:35.461
It was never
your choice, Mother.

854
01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:40.642
But if I wasn’t a queen,
we would still be together.

855
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.207
You look so real.

856
01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:48.815
I can feel you.

857
01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.477
I can smell you.

858
01:10:54.854 --> 01:10:56.449
But I know you’re not.

859
01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:00.992
We are here with you, Mother.

860
01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:07.295
You must get ready.
It’s time.

861
01:11:32.859 --> 01:11:34.893
The Romans murdered men,
women, and children

862
01:11:34.894 --> 01:11:37.028
when they occupied
the town of Camulos.

863
01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.997
They made it
a retirement settlement

864
01:11:39.998 --> 01:11:41.868
for the senior centurions.

865
01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:46.597
Do you want
to forgive and forget?

866
01:11:46.598 --> 01:11:49.601
We go home, live another day?

867
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:53.307
Fuck them.

868
01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:55.948
Hail. That’s my queen.

869
01:11:59.952 --> 01:12:04.319
Go!

870
01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.019
You’ll make
a handsome centurion,

871
01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:10.483
Ivan.

872
01:13:10.484 --> 01:13:12.651
You know I don’t like that shit!

873
01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.623
Boudica.

874
01:13:18.624 --> 01:13:20.032
We met them on their ground.

875
01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.775
He was a man ahead of his time!

876
01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.471
Boudica!

877
01:13:55.067 --> 01:13:56.628
Beautiful retribution.

878
01:13:56.629 --> 01:14:00.270
It’s not over.
But it’s a start.

879
01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:36.734
Why aren’t they celebrating?

880
01:14:36.735 --> 01:14:39.407
To bear pain.
Tribute to the victory.

881
01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:40.508
To whom?

882
01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:44.017
Marco.

883
01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:51.122
By cutting your mark
into their cheek,

884
01:14:51.123 --> 01:14:53.895
they pay tribute
to you, my queen.

885
01:15:00.231 --> 01:15:02.299
Roman soldiers
have their stigma,

886
01:15:03.564 --> 01:15:05.829
now your men have theirs.

887
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:07.072
What?

888
01:15:07.073 --> 01:15:09.503
Do they know what it means?

889
01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.670
Who gives a shit?

890
01:15:11.671 --> 01:15:13.144
They can’t read Latin.

891
01:15:13.145 --> 01:15:15.245
Or any other language,
for that matter.

892
01:15:15.246 --> 01:15:17.919
But what matters
is that it’s your mark.

893
01:15:19.316 --> 01:15:20.680
They’re your army now.

894
01:15:26.851 --> 01:15:28.094
What are you doing?

895
01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:33.824
The Romans take pride
in their unit formations,

896
01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:36.035
and my men take great pleasure

897
01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.434
in relieving the silks
from the defeated.

898
01:15:41.206 --> 01:15:43.670
These are the units
you’ve crushed.

899
01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:47.949
The spoils of war, my queen.

900
01:15:50.611 --> 01:15:52.415
It’s not nearly enough.

901
01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:04.025
Boudica!

902
01:17:54.768 --> 01:17:58.706
Hold the line!
Hold the line! Don’t break!

903
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.489
Charge!

904
01:18:21.696 --> 01:18:24.204
Hold the line!

905
01:19:06.477 --> 01:19:08.841
The rioting is getting closer.

906
01:19:08.842 --> 01:19:10.282
It’s dangerous
for you to be here.

907
01:19:10.283 --> 01:19:12.251
Why do my people protest?

908
01:19:12.252 --> 01:19:14.187
The war in Europe was costly.

909
01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:15.849
Your people need a victory.

910
01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:18.389
It’s not my fault.

911
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:21.084
It’s the fault
of that awful woman.

912
01:19:21.085 --> 01:19:22.492
They were your laws!

913
01:19:22.493 --> 01:19:25.330
Your orders that
caused the insurrection.

914
01:19:25.331 --> 01:19:28.300
And now Boudica
and her army seem unstoppable.

915
01:19:28.301 --> 01:19:29.962
My dear Paulinus...

916
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:34.769
I’m a musician, not a warrior...

917
01:19:37.376 --> 01:19:39.641
Rome has forsaken me.

918
01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:40.808
Come with us.

919
01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:44.217
How will I defend myself?

920
01:19:44.218 --> 01:19:47.077
We’re not here to do you harm.

921
01:19:47.078 --> 01:19:50.685
I have...
only to appear and sing

922
01:19:50.686 --> 01:19:51.884
to have peace once more

923
01:19:51.885 --> 01:19:53.425
- in Gaul.
- No!

924
01:20:06.372 --> 01:20:09.672
Then I shall give Rome
the victory that you could not.

925
01:20:15.744 --> 01:20:17.349
Prepare the troops to move.

926
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:18.747
We sail in the morning.

927
01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:02.889
They are sending reinforcements
that we cannot defeat.

928
01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:04.825
Our army needs to recuperate.

929
01:21:04.826 --> 01:21:07.399
We will return in the spring
with more men from the north

930
01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:08.895
to bolster your ranks.

931
01:21:08.896 --> 01:21:12.096
What should my men think
of you leaving?

932
01:21:12.097 --> 01:21:14.033
You should send them
home as well.

933
01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:19.675
Because now
the time has come to retreat.

934
01:21:19.676 --> 01:21:21.876
I cannot lose, you know that!

935
01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:24.614
Why not finish what we started?

936
01:21:24.615 --> 01:21:28.421
You could become stronger
Briton king before you.

937
01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:33.393
I don’t ask my men
to fight in the winter.

938
01:21:34.691 --> 01:21:36.396
Your men should not either.

939
01:21:38.156 --> 01:21:40.498
When your men wake
to learn that he has left them,

940
01:21:40.499 --> 01:21:42.060
cause upset.

941
01:21:42.061 --> 01:21:45.536
He loves you,
but you have rejected him.

942
01:21:45.537 --> 01:21:47.307
So he leaves.

943
01:21:47.308 --> 01:21:48.836
Lay down with him.

944
01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:51.069
He will stay.

945
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:53.643
He would be king,
you could be queen.

946
01:21:53.644 --> 01:21:57.615
Together, you would defy fate
and destroy Rome’s armies.

947
01:21:59.386 --> 01:22:01.146
I can love only one man.

948
01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:04.116
What do your daughters say?

949
01:22:07.218 --> 01:22:09.891
It is our swiftness
that destroyed the Romans.

950
01:22:10.892 --> 01:22:14.467
Move decisively
and we can end this occupation.

951
01:22:19.197 --> 01:22:20.835
But it will be without me.

952
01:22:20.836 --> 01:22:24.444
You’ll be sending
exhausted men to slaughter.

953
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:27.172
I can order you to stay.

954
01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:29.745
Or...

955
01:22:29.746 --> 01:22:30.912
have you killed.

956
01:22:33.244 --> 01:22:34.454
You could.

957
01:22:36.181 --> 01:22:37.281
But you won’t.

958
01:22:53.605 --> 01:22:56.299
Be sure to take everything.

959
01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.676
Don’t leave anything behind.

960
01:23:11.458 --> 01:23:12.690
I cast no judgment.

961
01:23:15.594 --> 01:23:18.222
We will see each other
again in the Earrach.

962
01:23:18.223 --> 01:23:19.895
When the snow has melted.

963
01:23:21.534 --> 01:23:23.536
You’re the empress
of the land...

964
01:23:25.406 --> 01:23:26.539
the sky...

965
01:23:27.936 --> 01:23:29.069
the moon.

966
01:23:30.609 --> 01:23:32.413
But you will always be...

967
01:23:33.612 --> 01:23:34.844
my queen.

968
01:23:47.153 --> 01:23:48.890
Get yourselves ready!

969
01:23:48.891 --> 01:23:50.530
I want us moving by sunlight.

970
01:24:11.716 --> 01:24:13.586
Who did they send against me?

971
01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:15.620
As we speak,

972
01:24:15.621 --> 01:24:17.347
the great General Gaius Paulinus

973
01:24:17.348 --> 01:24:20.593
marches on his way
to Watling Street to meet you.

974
01:24:25.433 --> 01:24:26.632
Then...

975
01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:31.802
We will welcome him.

976
01:24:46.751 --> 01:24:49.687
We’ll use their
overconfidence to divide them.

977
01:24:49.688 --> 01:24:53.152
But these are not soldiers
that come to offer battle.

978
01:24:53.153 --> 01:24:55.319
They’re amateurs.

979
01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:59.192
And we, gentlemen,
are professionals.

980
01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:02.733
Eyes held high in pride

981
01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:05.165
are less able to see
the uneven ground ahead.

982
01:25:25.724 --> 01:25:27.792
Boudica! Boudica!

983
01:25:32.599 --> 01:25:37.131
Boudica! Kill them all!

984
01:25:42.906 --> 01:25:46.041
Boudica! Kill them all!

985
01:26:22.583 --> 01:26:24.046
I do not come...

986
01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:30.447
I do not come to boast
of a great ancestry,

987
01:26:30.448 --> 01:26:32.724
nor to recover my kingdom.

988
01:26:32.725 --> 01:26:35.793
I’m here to assert
the cause of liberty!

989
01:26:35.794 --> 01:26:38.521
Yes!

990
01:26:38.522 --> 01:26:40.765
From the pride
and arrogance of the Romans,

991
01:26:40.766 --> 01:26:42.097
nothing is sacred!

992
01:26:44.033 --> 01:26:47.168
The vindictive gods
are now at hand.

993
01:26:52.811 --> 01:26:53.944
Look around!

994
01:26:55.044 --> 01:26:57.342
See your brothers and sisters!

995
01:26:57.343 --> 01:26:59.718
And view our numbers.

996
01:26:59.719 --> 01:27:02.347
Behold how our tribes
come together

997
01:27:02.348 --> 01:27:04.625
to draw the avenging sword.

998
01:27:07.991 --> 01:27:10.795
On this spot...

999
01:27:10.796 --> 01:27:12.698
- We must conquer!
- Yes!

1000
01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:16.098
Or die with glory.

1001
01:27:17.363 --> 01:27:20.333
There is no alternative!

1002
01:27:25.404 --> 01:27:27.538
Boudica! Kill them all!

1003
01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:44.291
Attack!

1004
01:27:53.938 --> 01:27:55.071
Aaaaaaah!

1005
01:27:59.504 --> 01:28:02.441
Infantry, split the line!

1006
01:28:03.915 --> 01:28:05.047
Auxiliary...

1007
01:28:05.048 --> 01:28:06.180
Hold...

1008
01:28:06.181 --> 01:28:07.281
Hold!

1009
01:28:08.887 --> 01:28:10.119
Check your bearing!

1010
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:14.793
Archers, forward!

1011
01:28:14.794 --> 01:28:15.827
Archers...

1012
01:28:15.828 --> 01:28:16.961
pull!

1013
01:28:43.152 --> 01:28:44.449
Turn the chariot over!

1014
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:45.550
Turn it over!

1015
01:28:53.998 --> 01:28:55.164
Draw...

1016
01:29:10.817 --> 01:29:12.676
Draw... Loose!

1017
01:29:14.513 --> 01:29:15.855
Fire!

1018
01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.397
Fire!

1019
01:29:39.879 --> 01:29:45.247
Keep it coming, let’s go.
Lay into them. Wipe them out!

1020
01:29:47.711 --> 01:29:50.824
Ask your daughters
for help, Boudica. Now!

1021
01:29:52.892 --> 01:29:54.486
Girls!

1022
01:29:54.487 --> 01:29:56.092
Are you going to help us?

1023
01:29:56.093 --> 01:29:58.623
The time for fighting
is over, Mother.

1024
01:29:59.393 --> 01:30:01.394
Then what?

1025
01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.100
It’s time for you to join us.

1026
01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:07.566
What do they say?

1027
01:30:12.142 --> 01:30:16.014
After all we’ve been through,
want to die cowering.

1028
01:30:18.742 --> 01:30:20.512
I go where you go.

1029
01:30:20.513 --> 01:30:21.954
On my command.

1030
01:30:25.056 --> 01:30:26.287
On your word, my queen.

1031
01:30:26.288 --> 01:30:28.994
Let’s go.

1032
01:31:02.621 --> 01:31:04.061
Boudica!

1033
01:31:04.062 --> 01:31:05.294
Aaaaah!

1034
01:32:06.091 --> 01:32:07.356
Boudica!

1035
01:32:08.786 --> 01:32:10.194
Boudica!

1036
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:14.164
You are, and you always will be,

1037
01:32:14.165 --> 01:32:15.298
my queen!

1038
01:32:40.928 --> 01:32:42.963
No!

1039
01:33:06.481 --> 01:33:09.186
Time to be a wife
and mother again.

1040
01:33:09.187 --> 01:33:10.914
To love and to cherish.

1041
01:33:12.850 --> 01:33:15.060
Today, your name in sacrifice

1042
01:33:15.061 --> 01:33:17.755
is more important
than your victory in battle.

1043
01:33:17.756 --> 01:33:19.560
It’s time to go, Mother.

1044
01:34:27.991 --> 01:34:29.630
Yaaaah!

1045
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:47.213
You don’t

1046
01:35:55.584 --> 01:36:01.557
You don’t

1047
01:36:10.203 --> 01:36:15.934
You don’t

1048
01:36:24.877 --> 01:36:30.289
You don’t

1049
01:36:39.199 --> 01:36:44.600
You don’t

1050
01:36:53.543 --> 01:36:58.911
You don’t

1051
01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:13.200
You don’t

1052
01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:34.221
You don’t

1053
01:37:50.094 --> 01:37:56.199
You don’t
