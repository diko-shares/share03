WEBVTT

1
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:08.937
Forward!

2
00:02:10.512 --> 00:02:13.843
Go!

3
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.275
Suetonius Paulinus,

4
00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:01.951
Commander of the 14th Gemina
and the 20th Valeria Victrix!

5
00:04:10.258 --> 00:04:13.434
As Praefectus Castrorum
in charge,

6
00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:15.162
what did you have your men do?

7
00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:19.298
I advanced in triplex formation,
cohorts One to Four.

8
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.642
Three and Five in support.
Auxiliary cavalry on flank.

9
00:04:23.337 --> 00:04:25.039
And...

10
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.711
What did these cult leaders
of Mona do

11
00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:29.307
when they beheld
your invasion forces?

12
00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:31.310
Chanting as if
in some sort of trance.

13
00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:35.688
Even when facing
the 14th Gemina Legion,

14
00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:40.121
these experienced Celt
fighting men... kneeled?

15
00:04:41.355 --> 00:04:43.827
Trusting that
their religious leaders

16
00:04:43.828 --> 00:04:46.962
would offer them salvation
against your sword.

17
00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:49.636
Yes. It appears that way, Dominus.

18
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.968
You slaughtered them?

19
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.707
As is my duty to Rome.

20
00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:59.975
The Celt Cucullus believe
in the Furies,

21
00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:02.308
women warriors that symbolize
vengeance and rebirth.

22
00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:04.518
They believe that
a woman warrior

23
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:06.047
will somehow be their salvation

24
00:05:06.048 --> 00:05:08.951
and end the Roman occupation
of Britannia.

25
00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:14.385
They must not...
find their savior.

26
00:05:14.386 --> 00:05:16.530
As Augustus,
I've issued a strict decree,

27
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:19.435
forbidding women from holding
a position of influence,

28
00:05:19.837 --> 00:05:22.031
martial, judicial, or otherwise.

29
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.474
We don't need another woman
like my mother.

30
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:29.906
This decree must
be upheld verbatim.

31
00:05:29.907 --> 00:05:32.712
And under threat
of severe punishment.

32
00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:37.145
Especially in the tribes
of the island Britannia.

33
00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:39.917
Your Majesty.

34
00:07:43.504 --> 00:07:45.679
Uh!

35
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.210
You scared me.

36
00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.412
So help me, I love you more
with each day that passes.

37
00:07:54.823 --> 00:07:57.120
I know you have made me
the luckiest man alive.

38
00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:03.631
And you, my king,

39
00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:08.032
have made me the proudest
mother, wife, and queen.

40
00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:13.036
Let me take you, right now.

41
00:08:13.037 --> 00:08:15.566
Like old times.

42
00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:16.975
Mind's groggy...

43
00:08:18.682 --> 00:08:20.110
Neither asleep...

44
00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:22.276
nor awake.

45
00:08:22.277 --> 00:08:24.950
Mmm... You're definitely awake.

46
00:08:28.516 --> 00:08:30.053
Whatever we do this morning,

47
00:08:30.054 --> 00:08:33.662
my noble, brave,
and oh-so-worthy

48
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:35.421
king of the Iceni,

49
00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:37.193
we do it for an audience of, uh,

50
00:08:37.762 --> 00:08:41.031
several servants...

51
00:08:41.032 --> 00:08:43.133
A half dozen guards, and...

52
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.235
Two curious little girls.

53
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.710
They're awake, aren't they?

54
00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:51.273
Yeah.

55
00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:56.409
Good day my king.

56
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.784
May I join you for breakfast?

57
00:08:57.785 --> 00:09:00.380
You and the entire fort,
dear Ciaran!

58
00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:02.548
C'mon. Make yourself at home.

59
00:09:03.017 --> 00:09:04.450
I traveled through the night

60
00:09:04.451 --> 00:09:06.122
And I'm hungry.

61
00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:07.959
Hungry. He's hungry!

62
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.522
I'm hungry!

63
00:09:11.062 --> 00:09:13.834
I'm gonna eat your bones!
Arrrgh!

64
00:09:16.938 --> 00:09:18.805
How goes it in Camulos?

65
00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:20.533
We welcomed a new procurator.

66
00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:23.305
Catus Decianus.

67
00:09:24.308 --> 00:09:25.636
Should I be concerned?

68
00:09:25.637 --> 00:09:27.143
He's a Roman.

69
00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:29.310
Spoiled by Africa,
and he hates it here.

70
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:32.049
He'll transfer home at the
first sign of insurrection.

71
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.084
Let's hope.

72
00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:38.253
Sorry, Ciaran.

73
00:09:38.254 --> 00:09:41.521
My offspring have the
savage blood of the Ancients

74
00:09:41.923 --> 00:09:44.556
running through their veins.

75
00:09:44.557 --> 00:09:45.865
Like their mother.

76
00:09:45.866 --> 00:09:47.328
Your "offspring"...

77
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:48.704
is the daughter of a king.

78
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.102
A very intelligent and
quick-witted daughter,

79
00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:55.139
who will serve as a great
queen one day.

80
00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:00.781
Mornin'.

81
00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:02.508
Ah! Latin study, girls!

82
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:04.346
Good morning, girls.
Are we ready for class?

83
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:06.051
Yes... Hey!

84
00:10:09.285 --> 00:10:11.616
Little savages.

85
00:10:11.617 --> 00:10:14.355
We earn money to pay
a Roman tutor

86
00:10:14.356 --> 00:10:17.028
to teach our daughters
the language of our occupier,

87
00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:21.165
so they might understand
how to navigate a future...

88
00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:24.035
A future where
their father's rule

89
00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:26.203
will be a distant memory
of an old colony.

90
00:10:27.173 --> 00:10:28.908
Well, we must change,

91
00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:31.669
if we don't want to be
left alone in the cold like...

92
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.572
Barbarian Brigantes.

93
00:10:33.573 --> 00:10:36.279
Well, I love my barbarian wife.

94
00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:41.514
You have king-like things
to discuss with brave Ciaran,

95
00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:44.221
my love, and I have
a cosmetics session.

96
00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:47.191
And then I'm taking
the girls to the market.

97
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.027
We'll come find you.

98
00:10:49.028 --> 00:10:50.359
Promise me you always will.

99
00:10:51.164 --> 00:10:52.229
I promise.

100
00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:55.694
Sit down. Come on.

101
00:10:56.063 --> 00:10:57.971
Eat this. No waste in here.

102
00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:07.573
We import fashionable cosmetics

103
00:11:07.574 --> 00:11:11.215
from Germania, Gaul,
and fabled Serica.

104
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:14.646
Some are so expensive and rare,

105
00:11:14.647 --> 00:11:18.519
the Emperor himself chokes when
he pays for his wife's bill.

106
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:32.907
Excess hair is not considered
fashionable at all this season.

107
00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:39.242
Rouge for the cheeks,

108
00:11:39.243 --> 00:11:41.772
red ocher, imported from Belgium

109
00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:45.579
and ground against mortar stone
into the finest powder.

110
00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:50.451
The color of your tunic
is so beautiful.

111
00:11:50.452 --> 00:11:51.782
Where did you find it?

112
00:11:51.783 --> 00:11:52.959
From the Oppida,

113
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.830
outside of Roman security lines.

114
00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:56.997
It was cheap there.

115
00:12:01.003 --> 00:12:02.365
Should we go?

116
00:12:18.086 --> 00:12:19.513
Oh, excuse me.

117
00:12:19.514 --> 00:12:21.548
We're looking for the Oppida.

118
00:12:21.549 --> 00:12:22.813
Down there.

119
00:12:22.814 --> 00:12:23.958
Thank you.

120
00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:41.767
What?

121
00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:43.504
What's the matter with you?

122
00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:44.880
We should not go there.

123
00:12:45.282 --> 00:12:46.947
This is not a place for you.

124
00:12:46.948 --> 00:12:47.981
We're safe,

125
00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:49.676
the Romans are everywhere!

126
00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:51.677
Look what they do to thieves.

127
00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.856
These are not criminals,
they're Christians.

128
00:12:54.617 --> 00:12:55.780
Oh.

129
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:57.485
Christians don't mix well

130
00:12:57.486 --> 00:12:59.752
with other religions,
so the Romans crucify them.

131
00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:02.853
We should go back.

132
00:13:02.854 --> 00:13:04.558
I'll buy a bolt
of that material,

133
00:13:04.559 --> 00:13:06.693
then we can hurry back.
All right?

134
00:13:07.432 --> 00:13:08.497
Come on.

135
00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:26.482
Ah, yes.
What other colors do you have?

136
00:13:29.652 --> 00:13:32.223
Nodens, god of dogs and hunting,

137
00:13:32.224 --> 00:13:34.060
forbidden by Emperor Claudius.

138
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:37.162
Nodens is <i>not</i> one
of the divine personifications

139
00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:38.428
in the Imperial Cult.

140
00:13:40.795 --> 00:13:42.530
The gods only granted man

141
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:45.203
the gifts of intelligence,
virtue, and fidelity.

142
00:13:45.204 --> 00:13:46.732
Some fresh fruit?

143
00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:48.503
If the Imperial Cult
was so virtuous,

144
00:13:48.504 --> 00:13:50.010
why did they murder
all the Druids?

145
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:52.079
Hey!
Change the subject please.

146
00:13:56.842 --> 00:13:58.712
Look, Trinovante warriors.

147
00:14:20.802 --> 00:14:22.934
Boudica.

148
00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:26.476
Stop that talk!

149
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.810
This is Boudica.

150
00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:41.094
Why are they kneeling?

151
00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:42.953
And what does Boudica mean?

152
00:14:42.954 --> 00:14:44.527
She was a Trinovante queen.

153
00:14:45.233 --> 00:14:46.891
Mother's an Iceni queen?

154
00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:48.134
Your mother's a Trinovante

155
00:14:48.135 --> 00:14:50.005
who became an Iceni queen.

156
00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:52.039
To these people, that marks her

157
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.668
more powerful than
the Roman Emperor.

158
00:14:54.803 --> 00:14:56.341
She's like a god to them!

159
00:14:58.774 --> 00:15:01.412
Did your slave just speak ill
of the Emperor?

160
00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:04.316
She meant nothing by it.

161
00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.977
She's a servant, not a slave.

162
00:15:06.978 --> 00:15:10.157
Are you something special
to these joke barbarians?

163
00:15:10.592 --> 00:15:13.259
Vagrants who get fat
on Roman tributes.

164
00:15:13.861 --> 00:15:15.690
It appears you know
more than I, sir.

165
00:15:16.059 --> 00:15:17.626
I don't know who they are.

166
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:19.429
Come along, children.

167
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:21.332
Your slave made
a disparaging remark

168
00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:22.795
about the Emperor.

169
00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:23.928
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:25.667
A queen can afford some wine.

171
00:15:26.274 --> 00:15:28.702
Or the Roman auxiliary

172
00:15:28.703 --> 00:15:31.276
can hear about your slave's
rebellious nature.

173
00:15:31.277 --> 00:15:33.476
You've really gone too far now!

174
00:15:33.477 --> 00:15:35.115
We have to find your father!

175
00:15:35.116 --> 00:15:37.910
You're not going anywhere!
Find a legionarius!

176
00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.191
Aaargh!

177
00:16:01.705 --> 00:16:02.770
Go!

178
00:16:09.878 --> 00:16:11.878
Do you want
to know what I did today?

179
00:16:12.848 --> 00:16:16.058
I stood in front of
a room full of centurions

180
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.390
and had to swear that my wife

181
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:22.690
was a civil and gentle soul.

182
00:16:22.691 --> 00:16:24.131
A wonderful mother,

183
00:16:24.132 --> 00:16:27.795
who just simply loves to weave.

184
00:16:28.564 --> 00:16:31.996
I said and did
nothing to provoke them.

185
00:16:31.997 --> 00:16:33.031
I promise.

186
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:41.005
I negotiated
and bargained more today,

187
00:16:41.006 --> 00:16:43.382
and with more passion,
than I've had to do in years.

188
00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:47.913
It was really quite thrilling.

189
00:16:47.914 --> 00:16:49.190
However...

190
00:16:50.292 --> 00:16:51.752
I do not wish to do it again,

191
00:16:51.753 --> 00:16:53.754
so we will send
servants into town

192
00:16:53.755 --> 00:16:55.360
next time you want
something special.

193
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:57.462
Like a blue robe.

194
00:16:58.663 --> 00:17:00.465
At least for the
next year or so.

195
00:17:04.504 --> 00:17:06.405
Tell me, what does it mean?

196
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.505
Boudica...

197
00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:09.737
Mm-hm?

198
00:17:09.738 --> 00:17:11.376
She was a Trinovante legend

199
00:17:11.377 --> 00:17:13.103
before the time of the Druids.

200
00:17:13.104 --> 00:17:14.577
A fierce goddess.

201
00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:17.548
A proud warrior people
that were too...

202
00:17:18.617 --> 00:17:20.419
stubborn to negotiate.

203
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:23.949
And some believe
she will come again,

204
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:25.687
to free us from the Romans.

205
00:17:25.688 --> 00:17:26.755
Why me?

206
00:17:30.629 --> 00:17:32.266
My love.

207
00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:35.830
You and I were married
when we were young.

208
00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.503
You have a proud lineage.

209
00:17:41.211 --> 00:17:42.804
There's barbarian blood

210
00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:45.213
that drives your heart,

211
00:17:46.447 --> 00:17:48.281
and they can see that.

212
00:17:48.282 --> 00:17:50.482
It's impossible to hide
it from those people.

213
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.111
Because they look at you
and they see

214
00:17:54.112 --> 00:17:55.981
what you have
achieved with your life.

215
00:17:55.982 --> 00:17:57.192
It incites them.

216
00:17:58.294 --> 00:17:59.623
Fills them full of hope.

217
00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.328
Is that a bad thing?

218
00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:07.202
It might scare the Romans
is all that I am saying.

219
00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:12.162
So I wish for you to stay here
and avoid town and barbarians,

220
00:18:12.163 --> 00:18:14.099
at least for a few weeks.

221
00:18:15.102 --> 00:18:16.244
Of course.

222
00:18:16.746 --> 00:18:18.642
Of course.

223
00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:22.975
You're gonna have
to keep me prisoner.

224
00:18:22.976 --> 00:18:24.043
Mmm.

225
00:18:25.178 --> 00:18:27.178
Ugh! Savages!

226
00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.016
You monsters! Aah!

227
00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:32.051
Don't kill me!
Ha ha ha!

228
00:18:33.593 --> 00:18:35.659
Where's the honey mead
you promised me, then?

229
00:18:37.122 --> 00:18:38.628
Then you wanted
to wash away the taste

230
00:18:38.629 --> 00:18:40.828
of that shitty Roman wine
you've been drinking?

231
00:18:40.829 --> 00:18:42.864
If it gets me drunk,
I'll drink it.

232
00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:48.440
So, finally, I've found my three
most fierce warriors!

233
00:18:48.441 --> 00:18:51.312
How are you boys
intimidated by our skill?

234
00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.138
Ugh!

235
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:55.810
Get him!

236
00:18:55.811 --> 00:18:57.548
Oh, gotcha!

237
00:18:57.549 --> 00:19:01.146
Raargh, that's what you get
for fighting a king!

238
00:19:02.726 --> 00:19:04.687
I'll be back
at the Crannog, my liege.

239
00:19:04.688 --> 00:19:07.185
You can take my wild daughters
with you.

240
00:19:08.496 --> 00:19:11.024
- I want to speak with my queen.
- This way.

241
00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:17.062
What's the matter with him?

242
00:19:17.063 --> 00:19:19.504
When a man fights in a war

243
00:19:19.505 --> 00:19:21.671
and loses his family, his home.

244
00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:22.904
Ends up with nothing...

245
00:19:23.606 --> 00:19:26.006
Laughter and the sword
cease to go hand in hand.

246
00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:29.108
Hm. Well, <i>you</i> should've seen

247
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.582
the way that woman
used her sword.

248
00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:33.551
She was...
she was so impressive.

249
00:19:33.552 --> 00:19:34.883
She attacked...

250
00:19:36.216 --> 00:19:38.788
...without hesitation.

251
00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:43.759
I'm not sure I want my daughters

252
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.696
to be Trinovante Brigante, though.

253
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.535
Fighting. Never trusting anyone.

254
00:19:50.934 --> 00:19:53.000
None of them
live very long lives.

255
00:19:54.707 --> 00:19:57.444
To be able to defend oneself...

256
00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.105
Hm!

257
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.075
Cannot be a bad thing.

258
00:20:02.715 --> 00:20:03.780
You...

259
00:20:04.282 --> 00:20:07.113
You clearly have
Trinovante blood in your veins.

260
00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.655
Use that ferocity
in a thoughtful way.

261
00:20:12.428 --> 00:20:13.790
Not in a bloodthirsty one.

262
00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:15.725
Mm-hmm.

263
00:20:15.726 --> 00:20:17.662
Use it to be the
best queen possible.

264
00:20:19.798 --> 00:20:21.226
Ha!

265
00:20:24.262 --> 00:20:25.439
Come get me!

266
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.737
If you want to be a warrior

267
00:20:27.738 --> 00:20:29.003
a Trinovante warrior.

268
00:20:30.072 --> 00:20:32.203
Mmm.

269
00:20:32.204 --> 00:20:33.271
Then let's go home.

270
00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:35.878
Because I have something
to give you.

271
00:20:46.253 --> 00:20:48.330
It's not really a gift from me.

272
00:20:50.125 --> 00:20:52.125
It's part of the dowry
given by your father,

273
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.435
when I asked for
your hand in marriage.

274
00:20:54.804 --> 00:20:57.163
At the time I didn't really
know what to do with it,

275
00:20:57.598 --> 00:20:59.506
but recent events have proven...

276
00:20:59.975 --> 00:21:02.839
It may well be possible
to leave your origins behind

277
00:21:04.744 --> 00:21:06.875
but I think your origins
will never leave you.

278
00:21:06.876 --> 00:21:08.272
Hmm.

279
00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:09.417
What is it, father?

280
00:21:13.247 --> 00:21:15.984
Protected for centuries
by the ancient Druids,

281
00:21:16.954 --> 00:21:18.624
the Queen of the Furies...

282
00:21:19.627 --> 00:21:20.758
Boudica.

283
00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.473
Thank you, Father.
My king.

284
00:21:33.872 --> 00:21:35.706
It is said that
the ancient smiths

285
00:21:35.707 --> 00:21:38.412
used forgotten magic
from the mountain mists

286
00:21:38.413 --> 00:21:40.337
to forge blades like this.

287
00:21:40.338 --> 00:21:41.581
If you look closely,

288
00:21:42.375 --> 00:21:43.879
you'll see how the color changes

289
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.145
with the flickering fire.

290
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.817
As if the God spell
of the Earth itself

291
00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:49.347
is woven within its bronze.

292
00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:09.543
I love it.

293
00:22:14.682 --> 00:22:16.242
Perhaps
we rest the blade for now.

294
00:22:20.347 --> 00:22:21.654
Mother!

295
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:28.561
What are you staring at?

296
00:22:28.562 --> 00:22:30.025
I don't know.

297
00:22:31.765 --> 00:22:33.291
A premonition, perhaps.

298
00:22:33.292 --> 00:22:35.932
Good things, I hope?

299
00:22:58.561 --> 00:23:01.188
The Romans are here!

300
00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:20.911
Legions, attention!

301
00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:25.112
Make way for our
most esteemed procurator,

302
00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:26.554
Catus Decianus!

303
00:23:27.414 --> 00:23:29.315
Legion! Outward!

304
00:24:26.308 --> 00:24:29.176
My lord, this day the Iceni
welcomed you here.

305
00:24:29.177 --> 00:24:30.617
To our lands.

306
00:24:30.618 --> 00:24:32.719
Today, we pay tribute
to the Empire.

307
00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:34.919
Come. Go with us inside.

308
00:24:43.488 --> 00:24:45.325
<i>...Iurat capillos esse,</i>

309
00:24:46.361 --> 00:24:48.229
<i>quos emit, suos.</i>

310
00:24:48.698 --> 00:24:51.132
<i>Numquid illa,</i>

311
00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:52.398
<i>Paule, peierat?</i>

312
00:24:56.074 --> 00:24:59.075
Well done! They pleased you, no?

313
00:25:01.211 --> 00:25:05.509
Dare I presume to ask
whether they have Roman tutors?

314
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:06.785
They do.

315
00:25:06.786 --> 00:25:08.886
I knew it!
I told you, Maximus,

316
00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:11.691
I told you that they had
Roman tutors for their children.

317
00:25:11.692 --> 00:25:13.286
When I was in Africa,

318
00:25:13.287 --> 00:25:15.662
I witnessed a dancing monkey

319
00:25:15.663 --> 00:25:18.292
that had been taught
by a Roman tutor.

320
00:25:18.727 --> 00:25:20.359
They really are
the best in the world.

321
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.262
They can teach anybody

322
00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:23.638
the basics of culture.

323
00:25:24.073 --> 00:25:26.069
Even these barbarian children.

324
00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:31.910
How long do you intend to grace
us with your presence, my lord?

325
00:25:32.605 --> 00:25:34.340
A year.

326
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:35.617
Maybe two.

327
00:25:41.614 --> 00:25:43.250
We'll leave in the morning.

328
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:46.154
You need only feed
my small entourage

329
00:25:46.155 --> 00:25:47.617
from your supplies for tonight,

330
00:25:47.618 --> 00:25:49.993
and, uh, my pay convoy

331
00:25:49.994 --> 00:25:51.522
on the ides of each third month,

332
00:25:51.523 --> 00:25:53.062
en route to Fallbrook Forest.

333
00:25:53.063 --> 00:25:55.164
Don't worry,
my brittunculi friend.

334
00:25:55.566 --> 00:25:57.265
We haven't come
to clean you out.

335
00:25:58.101 --> 00:26:00.432
Well, you're welcome to stay
as long as you wish.

336
00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:03.600
It is an honor to host you.

337
00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:05.207
So, tell me, Prasutagus...

338
00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:08.605
You built this fort yourself?

339
00:26:08.606 --> 00:26:11.983
No, it is a holding
handed down within my family.

340
00:26:12.452 --> 00:26:14.644
I have merely
improved upon it, and...

341
00:26:14.645 --> 00:26:18.318
will continue to maintain
it for our next generation.

342
00:26:18.319 --> 00:26:21.058
Then your family
stole it from someone.

343
00:26:22.325 --> 00:26:23.830
Bought it, traded, or won it.

344
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:26.425
My ancestors had a reputation

345
00:26:26.426 --> 00:26:29.198
for avoiding violence
when necessary.

346
00:26:30.168 --> 00:26:32.871
And I try to uphold
the same tradition.

347
00:26:32.872 --> 00:26:35.269
My king is the personification

348
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.272
of the civilization
in this land.

349
00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:46.721
Solid, bed-rock foundation!

350
00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:50.383
Arable land that you till

351
00:26:50.384 --> 00:26:54.025
and keep fertile with manure
of the beasts that graze here.

352
00:26:54.694 --> 00:26:57.324
And, uh, soil that
does not hold damp,

353
00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:59.062
with the elevation water run-off

354
00:26:59.063 --> 00:27:00.690
and down-hill mitigation.

355
00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:04.596
And the view?
Well, unimpeded from all sides.

356
00:27:05.698 --> 00:27:07.301
I warrant that on a clear day

357
00:27:07.302 --> 00:27:09.843
you can see all the way
to the Watling road.

358
00:27:11.044 --> 00:27:12.207
You are correct.

359
00:27:12.208 --> 00:27:14.671
It's no wonder that this fort

360
00:27:14.672 --> 00:27:18.048
has been so sought-after
this last millennium.

361
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:20.348
My British king.

362
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.759
We serve you well here, Lord.

363
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:27.553
Yes.

364
00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:29.456
Yes indeed, you do.

365
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.399
We're going to have to be
very well-behaved Britons.

366
00:27:38.734 --> 00:27:42.171
This officious bastard could
royally fuck us if he chooses.

367
00:27:42.172 --> 00:27:44.041
We have to be smart about this.

368
00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:45.813
We make ourselves indispensable.

369
00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.214
You are...
Right. Of course.

370
00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:54.118
Now, ready the guards to leave.

371
00:27:54.787 --> 00:27:56.790
We'll run raiding parties
for a few days.

372
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:59.386
Round up any bandits,
cattle thieves, undesirables,

373
00:27:59.387 --> 00:28:01.620
and we'll send those
to Catus Decianus as a tribute.

374
00:28:03.261 --> 00:28:04.897
Knowing these lands
are dangerous

375
00:28:04.898 --> 00:28:07.769
might temper his desires
to settle here.

376
00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:12.971
You're a wise man, my lord.

377
00:28:12.972 --> 00:28:15.138
I'll ride with the party.

378
00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:16.701
Exercise will do me good.

379
00:28:27.714 --> 00:28:29.890
I have such a thirst
for you, woman!

380
00:28:30.726 --> 00:28:34.223
A dryness in my soul
that only you can quench.

381
00:28:34.224 --> 00:28:35.654
Mother, Father!

382
00:28:36.123 --> 00:28:37.556
Oh, school is over?

383
00:28:37.557 --> 00:28:38.931
Yes.

384
00:28:38.932 --> 00:28:40.131
I need to take
a good look at you.

385
00:28:40.733 --> 00:28:42.429
Now you need to promise me

386
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:44.597
that you will always stay
by your mother's side.

387
00:28:45.732 --> 00:28:46.796
Promise?

388
00:28:46.797 --> 00:28:47.973
Promise.

389
00:28:47.974 --> 00:28:50.174
All three of you, stay warm.

390
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.275
I promise.

391
00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:56.884
And I need you to know
that I love you.

392
00:28:57.887 --> 00:28:59.282
And I always will.

393
00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:05.453
I love you too.

394
00:30:12.687 --> 00:30:15.226
The men are back!
Close the gate!

395
00:30:51.726 --> 00:30:52.890
Aaargh!

396
00:31:35.077 --> 00:31:37.242
Long live the
Queen of the Iceni.

397
00:33:18.213 --> 00:33:20.906
All hail Caesar Augustus Nero!

398
00:33:23.218 --> 00:33:25.152
Hail, Catus Decianus.

399
00:33:26.353 --> 00:33:27.549
Please join us.

400
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:29.353
I shall not stay...

401
00:33:29.354 --> 00:33:31.191
I feel my presence

402
00:33:31.927 --> 00:33:34.854
weighs heavily on the mood
of the locals.

403
00:33:36.361 --> 00:33:39.429
You read too much
into simple curiosity.

404
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.267
Did you receive my tribute?

405
00:33:41.962 --> 00:33:44.698
Yes. I did.

406
00:33:44.699 --> 00:33:45.964
And I thank you.

407
00:33:47.033 --> 00:33:48.537
You have bequeathed

408
00:33:48.538 --> 00:33:51.475
half of your holdings
and lands to me.

409
00:33:52.742 --> 00:33:56.611
'Tis a most
generous acquiescence.

410
00:33:56.612 --> 00:33:58.812
I'm glad
his lordship is satisfied.

411
00:33:59.881 --> 00:34:01.419
Oh, I have not said that.

412
00:34:03.786 --> 00:34:06.885
As a woman, Rome cannot

413
00:34:06.886 --> 00:34:11.594
and will not
recognize you as queen.

414
00:34:14.434 --> 00:34:17.138
No female is recognized
as worthy

415
00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:20.097
of any position
of governing power.

416
00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:23.902
To do so is a rebuke
against Rome,

417
00:34:23.903 --> 00:34:26.069
Senate, and Empire!

418
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.973
And a personal indignity
to the Emperor.

419
00:34:28.974 --> 00:34:31.514
To try and bribe me

420
00:34:31.515 --> 00:34:35.782
into turning a blind eye
to this wanton ridicule,

421
00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:38.147
this perversion of our laws,

422
00:34:38.148 --> 00:34:39.787
is a crime!

423
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:42.988
One that begs
to be punished to the full.

424
00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:45.166
I don't understand you.

425
00:34:45.668 --> 00:34:47.090
Well then let me make it simple

426
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:49.203
for your barbarian brain
to ingest...

427
00:34:50.072 --> 00:34:54.241
I shall not be taking half
of your holdings and lands.

428
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.574
I shall take <i>all</i>
of your kingdom.

429
00:34:58.109 --> 00:35:01.215
And you will be flogged.

430
00:35:01.884 --> 00:35:04.679
A fate shared by your children,

431
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.143
while you watch.

432
00:35:07.784 --> 00:35:09.322
Oh, you look to Ciaran!

433
00:35:10.391 --> 00:35:14.293
The man who told me
where you husband would be

434
00:35:14.294 --> 00:35:15.955
the day he was killed.

435
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:23.061
Roman gold will make a convert
of the weak and covetous.

436
00:35:26.869 --> 00:35:30.001
Stand... down!

437
00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:31.344
No, please!

438
00:35:43.215 --> 00:35:45.918
Appointed by the Empire,

439
00:35:45.919 --> 00:35:48.757
bequeathed
by the Emperor himself,

440
00:35:49.496 --> 00:35:51.660
my word is law

441
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:53.861
as if spoken by Nero!

442
00:35:55.302 --> 00:35:58.733
Henceforth, all land
and properties

443
00:35:58.734 --> 00:36:04.035
owned by Prasutagus of Iceni

444
00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:05.070
are mine!

445
00:36:07.712 --> 00:36:08.942
Hail Nero.

446
00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:20.492
Aaaaah!

447
00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:29.765
Don't you dare touch her!

448
00:36:34.376 --> 00:36:36.310
Noooo! Aaaaah!

449
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:45.616
This was a gift from Nero.

450
00:36:46.454 --> 00:36:48.487
One holds it into fire

451
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:51.325
then pushes it onto the face

452
00:36:51.927 --> 00:36:56.252
of any misbehaving slave,
thus branding them his property.

453
00:36:56.253 --> 00:36:57.462
N. R.

454
00:36:57.463 --> 00:37:00.630
Nero Rex Dramus.

455
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:02.060
A-Although, in your case,

456
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:03.898
the N. R. could stand for

457
00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:06.164
Nec Regina.

458
00:37:06.936 --> 00:37:08.001
Queen no more.

459
00:37:09.103 --> 00:37:12.477
Any disruptive brittunculi

460
00:37:12.478 --> 00:37:13.908
looking to you

461
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.515
will see this mark, laugh,

462
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:19.243
and be reminded
of your falsehood.

463
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.493
Ohhh...

464
00:37:29.396 --> 00:37:31.695
The illicit smell
of burning flesh.

465
00:38:54.173 --> 00:38:55.844
Shh, shh, shh.

466
00:38:55.845 --> 00:38:58.111
Quiet. You must come with us.

467
00:39:38.824 --> 00:39:40.889
Do <i>not</i> die here.

468
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.793
We have to keep moving.

469
00:40:28.269 --> 00:40:31.468
Mmm... Girls?

470
00:40:34.616 --> 00:40:35.681
Girls?

471
00:40:43.317 --> 00:40:44.888
Where are my daughters?

472
00:40:46.452 --> 00:40:47.791
Where are my daughters?

473
00:40:47.792 --> 00:40:48.892
Shhh.

474
00:40:52.159 --> 00:40:54.094
Were they hurt?

475
00:40:54.095 --> 00:40:55.965
Where are my daughters?

476
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.035
Woah, woah, woah.

477
00:41:02.875 --> 00:41:05.645
Ugh! Oh, I forgot.

478
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.944
Ohhh.

479
00:41:10.784 --> 00:41:12.883
I can't understand
what happened.

480
00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:15.819
You must bring them.

481
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.887
You must bring them, I...

482
00:41:17.888 --> 00:41:19.218
I want to hug them.

483
00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:21.254
Where are my children?

484
00:41:23.896 --> 00:41:27.524
We... are your children, Boudica.

485
00:41:44.851 --> 00:41:46.620
I need to see my girls.

486
00:41:52.391 --> 00:41:54.484
- There you are, Mother!
- Mother, darling!

487
00:41:54.485 --> 00:41:56.421
Oh! Babies!

488
00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.604
My babies!

489
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.139
I'm so sorry!

490
00:42:13.209 --> 00:42:15.814
I'm so, so sorry.

491
00:42:16.249 --> 00:42:18.113
I couldn't protect you.

492
00:42:18.885 --> 00:42:21.985
You know...
I fought so hard.

493
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.660
I tried everything.

494
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.487
It's all right, Mother.

495
00:42:30.488 --> 00:42:32.292
We're here with you now.

496
00:42:39.631 --> 00:42:40.773
For your mouth.

497
00:42:44.075 --> 00:42:46.603
- What?
- For teeth.

498
00:42:53.414 --> 00:42:56.184
She says a warrior
must be able to bite.

499
00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.890
She stole it from
the mouth of a dead centurion.

500
00:42:59.891 --> 00:43:01.551
Ohhh...

501
00:43:01.552 --> 00:43:03.993
So happy.

502
00:43:03.994 --> 00:43:06.259
You must eat.

503
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.131
She is a warrior.
And a soothsayer.

504
00:43:10.805 --> 00:43:12.596
She says that
you are to be queen.

505
00:43:13.265 --> 00:43:15.335
That your task is
to kill the Romans.

506
00:43:16.668 --> 00:43:18.140
We are here to help you, Mother.

507
00:43:19.748 --> 00:43:21.176
My babies.

508
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.278
My babies!

509
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.788
You must eat.

510
00:43:57.643 --> 00:43:59.147
What are you learning?

511
00:43:59.148 --> 00:44:01.710
We learn how to use weapons.

512
00:44:01.711 --> 00:44:03.921
Must a Trinovante woman fight?

513
00:44:03.922 --> 00:44:06.286
A Trinovante woman
can do anything.

514
00:44:06.287 --> 00:44:07.684
Best of all, they fight.

515
00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.490
Can I spend some time
with you, my dears?

516
00:44:12.059 --> 00:44:14.031
It feels like
I've seen nothing of you.

517
00:44:15.804 --> 00:44:17.166
Mmm...

518
00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:24.778
- I'm sorry I've disturbed you.
- You haven't.

519
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.077
Is there anything I can get
for you, my queen?

520
00:44:28.078 --> 00:44:30.343
I've got everything
I need right now.

521
00:44:30.344 --> 00:44:31.785
But thank you.

522
00:44:35.747 --> 00:44:37.714
She's looked after you well.

523
00:44:38.049 --> 00:44:40.023
She is our friend, Mother.

524
00:44:40.024 --> 00:44:41.255
Where are her children?

525
00:44:41.256 --> 00:44:43.192
The Romans killed her children.

526
00:44:43.761 --> 00:44:46.195
She had daughters. Like us.

527
00:44:46.697 --> 00:44:48.361
These people want you
to be their queen.

528
00:44:48.362 --> 00:44:50.594
They say you're chosen.
It's an honor.

529
00:44:50.595 --> 00:44:52.871
Oh no, I wasn't chosen.

530
00:44:52.872 --> 00:44:54.400
I was double-crossed
and betrayed,

531
00:44:54.401 --> 00:44:56.809
and my people let this happen!

532
00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.811
No, they mean that
Catus chose you.

533
00:44:58.812 --> 00:45:00.572
When he branded you.

534
00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.476
No, this...

535
00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:06.115
It's a mark of humiliation.

536
00:45:06.116 --> 00:45:08.612
To the Trinovante,
you have been anointed.

537
00:45:08.613 --> 00:45:10.779
It is our duty
to bring the tribes together.

538
00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.518
To kill the Romans.

539
00:45:13.519 --> 00:45:15.894
Do you remember what
Catus ordered his men to do?

540
00:45:15.895 --> 00:45:17.588
In front of your friends,
your family?

541
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:19.898
Oh I do, I do.
I'm sorry.

542
00:45:19.899 --> 00:45:22.132
I'm really, really sorry.

543
00:45:25.335 --> 00:45:26.905
You were the Queen of Iceni.

544
00:45:26.906 --> 00:45:28.534
You still <i>are</i>
the Queen of Iceni.

545
00:45:28.903 --> 00:45:31.305
These people need you now
more than ever.

546
00:45:31.306 --> 00:45:33.011
You really have no choice.

547
00:45:41.987 --> 00:45:43.614
Wait!

548
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:44.957
I'll show you.

549
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.192
Neck, under the arm.

550
00:45:50.228 --> 00:45:51.293
Wrist.

551
00:45:52.593 --> 00:45:54.064
Stomach will stop,

552
00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:55.626
but it won't kill.

553
00:45:55.627 --> 00:45:58.464
This is where most
wear their armor thickest.

554
00:45:58.465 --> 00:46:01.269
Neck, under the arm,

555
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.205
under the armor.

556
00:46:03.206 --> 00:46:05.141
These'll be your targets.

557
00:46:05.142 --> 00:46:06.209
Show me.

558
00:46:07.707 --> 00:46:09.640
Good! <i>Neck!</i>

559
00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:12.611
- Ooh! Wah!
- Yes.

560
00:46:16.749 --> 00:46:17.957
This is for you.

561
00:46:32.105 --> 00:46:33.907
Where did you get this?

562
00:46:35.141 --> 00:46:37.107
Catus gave it to a Roman.

563
00:46:37.108 --> 00:46:38.438
I killed him.

564
00:46:38.439 --> 00:46:40.078
And now it is yours again.

565
00:46:46.482 --> 00:46:47.920
Don't cry, Mother.

566
00:46:47.921 --> 00:46:49.351
We can't show weakness.

567
00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:52.617
Bronze is the metal of the past.

568
00:46:52.618 --> 00:46:53.992
It won't hold an edge.

569
00:46:53.993 --> 00:46:55.554
Heavy and unwieldy.

570
00:46:55.555 --> 00:46:57.490
More dangerous to its owner
than its enemy.

571
00:46:57.491 --> 00:46:59.690
Not this blade.
Not to me.

572
00:46:59.691 --> 00:47:01.902
Who's using my training area?

573
00:47:10.176 --> 00:47:13.836
You're the Iceni queen that's
come to save us, aren't you?

574
00:47:13.837 --> 00:47:15.409
They call her Boudica.

575
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:19.348
- That's a bold name.
- I did not choose it.

576
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.910
I see the brand on your face,

577
00:47:21.911 --> 00:47:25.584
and I've, uh, seen
what a cat-of-nine-tails

578
00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:27.388
does to a man's back.

579
00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:30.491
But how does that qualify you
to lead the Trinovante?

580
00:47:31.227 --> 00:47:33.593
Why should you be leader
and not me?

581
00:47:35.762 --> 00:47:37.135
I'm just Boudica.

582
00:47:38.732 --> 00:47:40.974
I fought as an auxiliary
for the Romans.

583
00:47:41.376 --> 00:47:42.899
So I know how they train,

584
00:47:43.234 --> 00:47:45.769
how they tool up,
how they fight.

585
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.903
How they think.

586
00:47:47.505 --> 00:47:50.015
Now I'm a deserter,
marked for death.

587
00:47:50.016 --> 00:47:51.940
As are all my men!

588
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:53.382
But I've returned...

589
00:47:53.851 --> 00:47:56.681
to lead my people
out of Roman bondage.

590
00:47:56.682 --> 00:47:58.585
So you'd best step aside.

591
00:48:08.234 --> 00:48:12.103
Is that what you're going
to challenge the Romans with?

592
00:48:12.104 --> 00:48:13.797
Bronze was good,

593
00:48:13.798 --> 00:48:15.404
when that was all we had.

594
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:17.307
Iron...

595
00:48:18.442 --> 00:48:20.409
That's the way
of modern warfare.

596
00:48:21.808 --> 00:48:22.939
May I?

597
00:48:35.921 --> 00:48:37.227
By the gods,

598
00:48:37.228 --> 00:48:38.624
it's ugly in the hand,

599
00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:41.199
heavy, imbalanced.

600
00:48:42.598 --> 00:48:44.333
There's no life to it.

601
00:48:44.334 --> 00:48:45.961
That's why we don't use
bronze anymore.

602
00:48:45.962 --> 00:48:47.370
Let me do you a favor!

603
00:48:49.902 --> 00:48:51.473
Huh!

604
00:48:55.479 --> 00:48:56.544
What?

605
00:48:57.547 --> 00:49:00.646
What? I did you a favor!

606
00:49:00.647 --> 00:49:01.714
Where is she?

607
00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:07.455
That blade was shit.

608
00:49:07.456 --> 00:49:09.392
Any real warrior
would know that.

609
00:49:18.139 --> 00:49:19.797
There's strong currents
in there.

610
00:49:19.798 --> 00:49:21.997
Strong enough to hold a man
down and drown him.

611
00:49:21.998 --> 00:49:25.440
Now I feel responsible.
Should I go in?

612
00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:26.574
What's so interesting?

613
00:49:30.778 --> 00:49:33.547
Maybe this sword chooses
who it performs for.

614
00:49:33.548 --> 00:49:35.385
How did you reshape the blade?

615
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.585
This is how I found it.

616
00:49:38.654 --> 00:49:40.324
This should be interesting.

617
00:49:51.304 --> 00:49:53.369
I was an archer in Armenia,

618
00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.602
tracker for Galba in Spain,

619
00:49:55.603 --> 00:49:57.242
swordsman for Rome.

620
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.706
In all of my years
living by the sword

621
00:50:00.707 --> 00:50:03.281
I've never seen anything
like this before.

622
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:05.480
Our people asked
the gods of the land

623
00:50:05.481 --> 00:50:07.218
to provide us a leader,

624
00:50:07.219 --> 00:50:08.583
and now they have!

625
00:50:11.082 --> 00:50:12.257
Queen Boudica...

626
00:50:14.591 --> 00:50:15.887
Kneel.

627
00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:18.054
Accept me,

628
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.793
and my men,
as your loyal servants.

629
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:57.433
I was happy being
a collaborator,

630
00:50:57.434 --> 00:50:58.600
and a wife.

631
00:51:02.606 --> 00:51:03.737
Now...

632
00:51:04.773 --> 00:51:06.443
those two girls are...

633
00:51:06.812 --> 00:51:11.283
the only trace of the old me.

634
00:51:13.683 --> 00:51:15.353
You think I can do this?

635
00:51:20.657 --> 00:51:22.426
You're the only one who can.

636
00:51:25.761 --> 00:51:26.859
Yeah.

637
00:51:34.968 --> 00:51:37.936
Forged
by Catuvellauni craftsmen...

638
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.345
before the time
of the Trinovante

639
00:51:41.346 --> 00:51:42.710
or the Iceni.

640
00:51:43.345 --> 00:51:45.515
The symbol of your royalty...

641
00:51:47.651 --> 00:51:52.423
stolen by the invaders from Rome
and returned to you now.

642
00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:58.264
Do you choose
the royal torque, Boudica?

643
00:52:00.499 --> 00:52:02.092
Put it on.

644
00:52:02.494 --> 00:52:05.029
You must choose it.
It's yours.

645
00:52:08.474 --> 00:52:11.672
In the name
of the four kings of Kent,

646
00:52:11.673 --> 00:52:14.246
Queen Boudica!

647
00:52:14.247 --> 00:52:18.009
Boudica!

648
00:52:19.287 --> 00:52:24.388
I am Boudica.
You are my people.

649
00:52:24.389 --> 00:52:26.721
We are in a time
of extreme peril.

650
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.329
We fight for our freedom!

651
00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:32.726
Yes!

652
00:52:32.727 --> 00:52:34.860
- We fight for our <i>honor!</i>
- Yes!

653
00:52:34.861 --> 00:52:36.895
The Romans fight for pay.

654
00:52:36.896 --> 00:52:38.303
We know that the Romans are paid

655
00:52:38.304 --> 00:52:40.371
on the ides
of every third month.

656
00:52:40.372 --> 00:52:42.065
In two days' time,

657
00:52:42.066 --> 00:52:44.342
Catus Decianus
will lead a pay convoy

658
00:52:44.343 --> 00:52:47.280
from Londinium to Venonis
and then to Eboracum.

659
00:52:48.316 --> 00:52:52.240
That will lead him straight
through Fallbrook Forest.

660
00:52:52.241 --> 00:52:54.287
Where we shall ambush him.

661
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.117
Catus Decianus has
a centurie of 80 men,

662
00:53:01.362 --> 00:53:04.395
Batavian auxiliaries marching
with him at all times,

663
00:53:04.396 --> 00:53:07.057
along with mounted Equites
and Galician mercenaries.

664
00:53:07.058 --> 00:53:10.731
He will destroy any ambush
you set. Any ambush.

665
00:53:10.732 --> 00:53:12.667
It's a perfect setup.

666
00:53:12.668 --> 00:53:16.540
The Romans have been plundering
our gold for 20 years!

667
00:53:17.175 --> 00:53:19.003
I think it's time
to take it back.

668
00:53:19.004 --> 00:53:19.939
Yes!

669
00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.347
We must plan a war!

670
00:53:22.348 --> 00:53:26.010
Wolfgar, if you're not
behind me in Fallbrook Forest,

671
00:53:26.011 --> 00:53:29.277
I will fight Catus alone.

672
00:53:29.278 --> 00:53:30.785
But I will fight him.

673
00:53:31.887 --> 00:53:34.085
You're as mad as a March hare.

674
00:53:34.989 --> 00:53:38.760
No. I'm as clear-headed
as I've ever been.

675
00:53:43.932 --> 00:53:47.571
I need to know
if you are with me.

676
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:13.564
Give me my sword.

677
00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:21.968
Thank you.

678
00:54:28.812 --> 00:54:30.977
Was I the only one who saw that?

679
00:54:44.289 --> 00:54:47.400
Our world is...
full of signs.

680
00:54:51.164 --> 00:54:52.702
She must be the one.

681
00:54:59.106 --> 00:55:01.381
You don't approve, huh?

682
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:06.012
Your silence speaks volumes.

683
00:55:06.647 --> 00:55:08.883
You ask a lot
of a simple people.

684
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:12.116
When opportunity
presents itself,

685
00:55:12.117 --> 00:55:13.656
we must seize it.

686
00:55:13.657 --> 00:55:16.528
And Catus in the forest
is an opportunity.

687
00:55:16.863 --> 00:55:18.090
Did I do wrong?

688
00:55:18.895 --> 00:55:20.862
You should not act so willfully.

689
00:55:21.231 --> 00:55:23.567
They call me queen.

690
00:55:23.568 --> 00:55:25.669
And then they question my plan.

691
00:55:26.672 --> 00:55:30.266
It's OK. We'll do this
on our own, girls.

692
00:55:30.267 --> 00:55:31.543
Look behind you, Mother.

693
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:49.626
What they say about you
cannot be more true.

694
00:55:49.627 --> 00:55:52.058
We have chosen you as our queen.

695
00:55:53.028 --> 00:55:54.290
Boudica!

696
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:56.832
Boudica! Boudica!

697
00:56:32.463 --> 00:56:34.837
Step off the road, brittunculi.

698
00:56:37.875 --> 00:56:39.941
Who the fuck are you talking to?

699
00:56:40.878 --> 00:56:42.074
Halt!

700
00:56:42.075 --> 00:56:43.373
<i>Halt!</i>

701
00:56:44.277 --> 00:56:45.848
You, peasant...

702
00:56:56.289 --> 00:56:57.595
You were dead.

703
00:56:57.596 --> 00:56:58.927
I'm your queen.

704
00:56:59.629 --> 00:57:01.699
Or has your ambition
blinded you?

705
00:57:04.165 --> 00:57:05.296
My queen.

706
00:57:12.646 --> 00:57:15.910
I don't know how
or why you're here,

707
00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:18.143
but you must leave now.

708
00:57:18.144 --> 00:57:19.617
I am queen,

709
00:57:19.618 --> 00:57:21.817
and I'd like to speak
to your regent,

710
00:57:21.818 --> 00:57:24.051
Catus Decianus.

711
00:57:25.417 --> 00:57:27.119
If you don't go now,

712
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.958
he will crucify you this time.

713
00:57:32.193 --> 00:57:33.390
Send word.

714
00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:37.196
The queen of the Iceni
wishes to parlay.

715
00:57:38.573 --> 00:57:40.033
If you don't tell him,

716
00:57:40.034 --> 00:57:42.035
he'll have you whipped like me.

717
00:57:42.036 --> 00:57:44.302
I guarantee you that.

718
00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:46.337
Hm.

719
00:57:52.378 --> 00:57:53.883
Take a good look!

720
00:57:55.117 --> 00:57:58.018
If you live to have children,

721
00:57:58.019 --> 00:57:59.559
they'll ask about me.

722
00:58:01.354 --> 00:58:04.156
Where is this brittunculi queen

723
00:58:04.157 --> 00:58:07.358
who would dare stop my cohort?

724
00:58:10.132 --> 00:58:13.705
Well... Speak, she-dog.

725
00:58:14.374 --> 00:58:17.907
I'm upset you don't
recognize me, dear Catus,

726
00:58:18.409 --> 00:58:21.009
or has time been
so unkind to me?

727
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:25.782
She is clearly insane.

728
00:58:25.783 --> 00:58:27.410
Remove and pillar her head

729
00:58:27.411 --> 00:58:31.920
and don't stop us
on such trivialities again!

730
00:58:31.921 --> 00:58:35.517
I'm Queen Boudica
of the Iceni and the Trinovante,

731
00:58:35.518 --> 00:58:39.027
the Celts, the Saxons,
of the northern Britons!

732
00:58:40.195 --> 00:58:45.065
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

733
00:58:45.066 --> 00:58:48.035
And it will take
a lot more than your blood

734
00:58:48.036 --> 00:58:50.268
to cleanse the foulness
you inflicted

735
00:58:50.269 --> 00:58:52.369
on me and my daughters!

736
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:55.405
Catus Decianus.

737
00:58:55.406 --> 00:58:57.715
Yeah. Come closer,

738
00:58:57.716 --> 00:58:59.916
and have a good look at my face.

739
00:59:00.787 --> 00:59:02.754
Something you remember?

740
00:59:06.122 --> 00:59:07.484
Bou-di-ca.

741
00:59:10.258 --> 00:59:13.391
Nec Regina!

742
00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.428
Your scar has healed.

743
00:59:18.429 --> 00:59:23.972
My men prefer to train
with live targets!

744
00:59:23.973 --> 00:59:26.205
Perhaps I shall grant them
that privilege.

745
00:59:26.206 --> 00:59:27.647
Now, my children.

746
00:59:30.542 --> 00:59:31.783
What witchery is this?

747
01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:04.159
He was hiding in the woods.

748
01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.327
Aaah!

749
01:03:06.796 --> 01:03:09.495
Hail, Queen Boudica!

750
01:03:10.762 --> 01:03:12.003
You traitor!

751
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:19.571
You traitor! Traitor!

752
01:03:21.509 --> 01:03:22.805
<i>Traitor!</i>

753
01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:27.744
You were supposed
to protect him.

754
01:03:31.385 --> 01:03:33.782
Enough! It's over!

755
01:03:33.783 --> 01:03:35.960
It's over.

756
01:03:35.961 --> 01:03:38.963
We won the day.
It's over.

757
01:03:38.964 --> 01:03:41.999
We won the day.

758
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.332
Boudica, my queen.
It's over.

759
01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:48.006
It's not over
until every Roman has gone.

760
01:03:49.405 --> 01:03:50.569
My queen?

761
01:03:51.038 --> 01:03:52.944
We ride for Camulos.

762
01:03:52.945 --> 01:03:55.947
Governor Paulinus is still
biding his time in Rome.

763
01:03:55.948 --> 01:03:57.443
The last I've heard,

764
01:03:57.444 --> 01:03:59.181
his Gemina Legion
was mopping up Druids

765
01:03:59.182 --> 01:04:02.053
in Anglesey, so...
The timing is perfect.

766
01:04:02.555 --> 01:04:04.781
It will need a blessing
from the Druid council.

767
01:04:05.784 --> 01:04:07.124
You'll see to it.

768
01:04:08.963 --> 01:04:10.292
You're serious.

769
01:04:11.757 --> 01:04:13.888
And I suspect a little mental.

770
01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:15.198
My queen.

771
01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:19.235
But war favors the possessed.

772
01:04:21.569 --> 01:04:22.634
Where are you going?

773
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.241
I reckon I'm going
to the Druid council

774
01:04:26.242 --> 01:04:28.936
to try to find a reason for a...

775
01:04:28.937 --> 01:04:31.247
Celtic Trinovante invasion
of Camulos.

776
01:04:32.547 --> 01:04:33.744
You are indeed.

777
01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:36.648
Yeah.

778
01:05:06.713 --> 01:05:09.945
When you drink from the skull
of Catus Decianus,

779
01:05:10.447 --> 01:05:11.991
your victory is complete.

780
01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:14.323
It's a tradition.

781
01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:36.047
There has of late
been a succession of ill omens

782
01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:38.445
for the Roman occupation force.

783
01:05:38.446 --> 01:05:41.943
Where they predict
misfortune for Nero,

784
01:05:41.944 --> 01:05:44.815
they promise fortune
for Brittania.

785
01:05:46.016 --> 01:05:47.158
And her queen...

786
01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:49.754
Boudica.

787
01:05:55.696 --> 01:05:57.761
The council supports your cause.

788
01:05:57.762 --> 01:06:00.698
Us. They support <i>us.</i>

789
01:06:00.699 --> 01:06:02.668
There's nothing
we cannot achieve.

790
01:06:09.644 --> 01:06:11.544
You're staring at me.

791
01:06:11.545 --> 01:06:13.349
You have your hand on my knee.

792
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:18.013
Oh.

793
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:22.984
Twenty years of killing enemies

794
01:06:22.985 --> 01:06:24.558
and chasing their wives.

795
01:06:25.693 --> 01:06:27.627
Forgive me, my queen.

796
01:06:27.996 --> 01:06:29.200
You're forgiven.

797
01:06:30.002 --> 01:06:31.993
But if you ever
touch me like that again,

798
01:06:31.994 --> 01:06:34.028
I'll kill you
before your little man

799
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:36.030
has had a chance
to raise himself.

800
01:06:36.031 --> 01:06:37.537
By god, woman,

801
01:06:37.538 --> 01:06:40.574
if I didn't already have
two wives...

802
01:06:41.343 --> 01:06:44.314
You have
a way with words, Wolfgar.

803
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:48.780
No one would judge us.

804
01:06:50.751 --> 01:06:54.390
Two warrior leaders,
a man and a woman,

805
01:06:55.294 --> 01:06:57.689
forged together
like charcoal and iron

806
01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:00.099
to become steel
in the furnace of war.

807
01:07:02.598 --> 01:07:04.664
I am the wife
of King Prasutagus.

808
01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:08.140
Please leave.

809
01:07:23.454 --> 01:07:26.113
You've come far, Queen Boudica.

810
01:07:26.114 --> 01:07:29.260
Life is impermanent.

811
01:07:30.054 --> 01:07:31.229
Transitory.

812
01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:36.168
We all die.
You. Your daughters.

813
01:07:36.737 --> 01:07:39.698
What do my daughters have
to do with this?

814
01:07:39.699 --> 01:07:42.965
They're in your mind,
as you survived.

815
01:07:42.966 --> 01:07:44.274
They did not.

816
01:07:44.275 --> 01:07:46.277
No. They're here.

817
01:07:46.746 --> 01:07:50.182
Like snowflakes in the air.

818
01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.284
So beautiful to watch.

819
01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:55.946
Snatch one in your hand.

820
01:07:57.818 --> 01:07:59.114
And when you look...

821
01:07:59.787 --> 01:08:01.457
It will be gone.

822
01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:07.694
Like goosebumps,
the first breath of winter.

823
01:08:08.994 --> 01:08:11.500
They will always be
with you, Boudica.

824
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:13.502
As spirits.

825
01:08:16.276 --> 01:08:18.067
Love what you can.

826
01:08:19.378 --> 01:08:21.906
Never forget
what it is that you love.

827
01:08:23.173 --> 01:08:24.777
As it defines you.

828
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:29.044
I want to die.

829
01:08:29.045 --> 01:08:30.255
You will.

830
01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:34.226
But first, you must lead
your army again.

831
01:08:35.162 --> 01:08:39.198
The Druid council have
sanctioned your ride to Camulos.

832
01:08:41.532 --> 01:08:42.696
What if I refuse?

833
01:08:43.365 --> 01:08:45.500
You're free to do as you wish.

834
01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.635
There are no rules
in this world.

835
01:08:48.869 --> 01:08:52.211
Except what death has put there.

836
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.765
Queen. You must rest.

837
01:09:21.066 --> 01:09:22.999
Tell me...

838
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.309
Do you see them?

839
01:09:24.872 --> 01:09:26.377
Do you see my daughters?

840
01:09:27.512 --> 01:09:30.072
They're... good girls.

841
01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:31.447
They behave well.

842
01:09:31.448 --> 01:09:32.547
They've been waiting for you.

843
01:09:32.548 --> 01:09:34.484
No, I asked, do you see them?

844
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:37.212
See them?

845
01:09:37.547 --> 01:09:39.720
We see them
in our hearts, Queen.

846
01:09:56.838 --> 01:09:58.904
You need to wake up, Mother.

847
01:10:02.778 --> 01:10:07.175
If you attack Camulos,
the Romans will come after you.

848
01:10:07.176 --> 01:10:09.420
They will send archers
to destroy you.

849
01:10:14.724 --> 01:10:16.724
I will kill whoever they send.

850
01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:20.464
And find where they live
and kill their families.

851
01:10:21.731 --> 01:10:23.257
You must do it, Mother.

852
01:10:23.258 --> 01:10:25.964
For us. For Father.

853
01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:29.472
This would not have happened,

854
01:10:29.473 --> 01:10:31.805
had I not chosen to be queen.

855
01:10:33.138 --> 01:10:35.171
It was never
your choice, Mother.

856
01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:40.352
But if I wasn't a queen,
we would still be together.

857
01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:44.917
You look so real.

858
01:10:46.987 --> 01:10:48.525
I can feel you.

859
01:10:49.825 --> 01:10:51.187
I can smell you.

860
01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:56.159
But I know you're not.

861
01:10:58.933 --> 01:11:00.702
We are here with you, Mother.

862
01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:07.005
You must get ready.
It's time.

863
01:11:32.604 --> 01:11:34.636
The Romans murdered men,
women, and children

864
01:11:34.637 --> 01:11:36.738
when they occupied
the town of Camulos.

865
01:11:38.038 --> 01:11:39.740
They made it
a retirement settlement

866
01:11:39.741 --> 01:11:41.578
for the senior centurions.

867
01:11:44.242 --> 01:11:46.308
Do you want
to forgive and forget?

868
01:11:46.843 --> 01:11:49.311
We go home, live another day?

869
01:11:51.755 --> 01:11:53.050
Fuck them.

870
01:11:53.051 --> 01:11:55.691
Hail. That's my queen.

871
01:11:59.697 --> 01:12:04.029
Go!

872
01:13:05.125 --> 01:13:07.762
You'll make
a handsome centurion,

873
01:13:07.763 --> 01:13:10.194
Ivan.

874
01:13:10.696 --> 01:13:12.361
You know I don't like that shit!

875
01:13:17.104 --> 01:13:18.366
Boudica.

876
01:13:18.367 --> 01:13:19.742
We met them on their ground.

877
01:13:24.978 --> 01:13:26.485
He was a man ahead of his time!

878
01:13:29.116 --> 01:13:30.181
Boudica!

879
01:13:54.812 --> 01:13:56.339
Beautiful retribution.

880
01:13:56.874 --> 01:13:59.980
It's not over.
But it's a start.

881
01:14:33.653 --> 01:14:36.477
Why aren't they celebrating?

882
01:14:36.478 --> 01:14:39.150
To bear pain.
Tribute to the victory.

883
01:14:39.151 --> 01:14:40.218
To whom?

884
01:14:42.662 --> 01:14:43.727
Marco.

885
01:14:47.128 --> 01:14:50.833
By cutting your mark
into their cheek,

886
01:14:51.335 --> 01:14:53.605
they pay tribute
to you, my queen.

887
01:14:59.976 --> 01:15:02.009
Roman soldiers
have their stigma,

888
01:15:03.309 --> 01:15:05.572
now your men have theirs.

889
01:15:05.573 --> 01:15:06.783
What?

890
01:15:07.152 --> 01:15:09.246
Do they know what it means?

891
01:15:09.247 --> 01:15:11.413
Who gives a shit?

892
01:15:11.414 --> 01:15:12.887
They can't read Latin.

893
01:15:12.888 --> 01:15:14.988
Or any other language,
for that matter.

894
01:15:14.989 --> 01:15:17.629
But what matters
is that it's your mark.

895
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:20.390
They're your army now.

896
01:15:26.596 --> 01:15:27.804
What are you doing?

897
01:15:30.237 --> 01:15:33.567
The Romans take pride
in their unit formations,

898
01:15:33.568 --> 01:15:35.778
and my men take great pleasure

899
01:15:35.779 --> 01:15:38.144
in relieving the silks
from the defeated.

900
01:15:40.951 --> 01:15:43.380
These are the units
you've crushed.

901
01:15:45.725 --> 01:15:47.659
The spoils of war, my queen.

902
01:15:50.356 --> 01:15:52.125
It's not nearly enough.

903
01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.735
Boudica!

904
01:17:54.511 --> 01:17:58.416
Hold the line!
Hold the line! Don't break!

905
01:18:10.265 --> 01:18:12.232
Charge!

906
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:23.914
Hold the line!

907
01:19:06.222 --> 01:19:08.584
The rioting is getting closer.

908
01:19:08.585 --> 01:19:10.025
It's dangerous
for you to be here.

909
01:19:10.026 --> 01:19:11.994
Why do my people protest?

910
01:19:11.995 --> 01:19:13.930
The war in Europe was costly.

911
01:19:13.931 --> 01:19:15.559
Your people need a victory.

912
01:19:16.936 --> 01:19:18.100
It's not my fault.

913
01:19:18.735 --> 01:19:20.827
It's the fault
of that awful woman.

914
01:19:20.828 --> 01:19:22.203
They were your laws!

915
01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:25.073
Your orders that
caused the insurrection.

916
01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:28.043
And now Boudica
and her army seem unstoppable.

917
01:19:28.044 --> 01:19:29.672
My dear Paulinus...

918
01:19:31.115 --> 01:19:34.479
I'm a musician, not a warrior...

919
01:19:37.121 --> 01:19:39.384
Rome has forsaken me.

920
01:19:39.385 --> 01:19:40.518
Come with us.

921
01:19:42.126 --> 01:19:43.960
How will I defend myself?

922
01:19:43.961 --> 01:19:46.820
We're not here to do you harm.

923
01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:50.428
I have...
only to appear and sing

924
01:19:50.429 --> 01:19:51.627
to have peace once more

925
01:19:51.628 --> 01:19:53.135
- in Gaul.
- No!

926
01:20:06.117 --> 01:20:09.382
Then I shall give Rome
the victory that you could not.

927
01:20:15.489 --> 01:20:17.092
Prepare the troops to move.

928
01:20:17.093 --> 01:20:18.457
We sail in the morning.

929
01:20:59.467 --> 01:21:02.632
They are sending reinforcements
that we cannot defeat.

930
01:21:02.633 --> 01:21:04.568
Our army needs to recuperate.

931
01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:07.142
We will return in the spring
with more men from the north

932
01:21:07.143 --> 01:21:08.606
to bolster your ranks.

933
01:21:09.442 --> 01:21:11.839
What should my men think
of you leaving?

934
01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.743
You should send them
home as well.

935
01:21:16.451 --> 01:21:19.418
Because now
the time has come to retreat.

936
01:21:19.419 --> 01:21:21.586
I cannot lose, you know that!

937
01:21:22.325 --> 01:21:24.325
Why not finish what we started?

938
01:21:24.727 --> 01:21:28.131
You could become stronger
than <i>any</i> Briton king before you.

939
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.103
I don't ask my men
to fight in the winter.

940
01:21:34.436 --> 01:21:36.106
Your men should not either.

941
01:21:37.901 --> 01:21:40.241
When your men wake
to learn that he has left them,

942
01:21:40.242 --> 01:21:41.771
it <i>will</i> cause upset.

943
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.279
He loves you,
but you have rejected him.

944
01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.050
So he leaves.

945
01:21:47.051 --> 01:21:48.547
Lay down with him.

946
01:21:48.916 --> 01:21:50.812
He will stay.

947
01:21:50.813 --> 01:21:53.386
He would be king,
you could be queen.

948
01:21:53.387 --> 01:21:57.325
Together, you would defy fate
and destroy Rome's armies.

949
01:21:59.131 --> 01:22:00.856
I can love only one man.

950
01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:03.826
What do your daughters say?

951
01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:09.601
It is our swiftness
that destroyed the Romans.

952
01:22:10.637 --> 01:22:14.177
Move decisively
and we can end this occupation.

953
01:22:18.942 --> 01:22:20.546
But it will be without me.

954
01:22:21.515 --> 01:22:24.154
You'll be sending
exhausted men to slaughter.

955
01:22:25.454 --> 01:22:26.882
I can order you to stay.

956
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.488
Or...

957
01:22:29.489 --> 01:22:30.622
have you killed.

958
01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:34.164
You could.

959
01:22:35.926 --> 01:22:36.991
But you won't.

960
01:22:53.350 --> 01:22:56.010
Be sure to take everything.

961
01:22:56.612 --> 01:22:58.386
Don't leave anything behind.

962
01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:12.400
I cast no judgment.

963
01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:17.965
We will see each other
again in the Earrach.

964
01:23:17.966 --> 01:23:19.605
When the snow has melted.

965
01:23:21.279 --> 01:23:23.246
You're the empress
of the land...

966
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:26.249
the sky...

967
01:23:27.681 --> 01:23:28.779
the moon.

968
01:23:30.354 --> 01:23:32.123
But you will always be...

969
01:23:33.357 --> 01:23:34.554
my queen.

970
01:23:46.898 --> 01:23:48.633
Get yourselves ready!

971
01:23:48.634 --> 01:23:50.240
I want us moving by sunlight.

972
01:24:11.461 --> 01:24:13.296
Who did they send against me?

973
01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:15.363
As we speak,

974
01:24:15.364 --> 01:24:17.090
the great General Gaius Paulinus

975
01:24:17.091 --> 01:24:20.303
marches on his way
to Watling Street to meet you.

976
01:24:25.178 --> 01:24:26.342
Then...

977
01:24:29.677 --> 01:24:31.512
We will welcome him.

978
01:24:46.496 --> 01:24:49.430
We'll use their
overconfidence to divide them.

979
01:24:49.431 --> 01:24:52.895
But these are not soldiers
that come to offer battle.

980
01:24:52.896 --> 01:24:55.062
They're amateurs.

981
01:24:55.063 --> 01:24:58.902
And we, gentlemen,
are professionals.

982
01:25:00.444 --> 01:25:02.476
Eyes held high in pride

983
01:25:02.477 --> 01:25:04.875
are less able to see
the uneven ground ahead.

984
01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:27.502
Boudica! Boudica!

985
01:25:32.344 --> 01:25:36.841
Boudica! Kill them all!

986
01:25:42.651 --> 01:25:45.751
Boudica! Kill them all!

987
01:26:22.328 --> 01:26:23.756
I do not come...

988
01:26:25.397 --> 01:26:30.190
I do not come to boast
of a great ancestry,

989
01:26:30.191 --> 01:26:32.435
nor to recover my kingdom.

990
01:26:33.171 --> 01:26:35.536
I'm here to assert
the cause of liberty!

991
01:26:35.537 --> 01:26:38.264
Yes!

992
01:26:38.265 --> 01:26:40.508
From the pride
and arrogance of the Romans,

993
01:26:40.509 --> 01:26:41.807
nothing is sacred!

994
01:26:43.778 --> 01:26:46.911
The vindictive gods
are now at hand.

995
01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:53.654
Look around!

996
01:26:54.789 --> 01:26:57.053
See your brothers and sisters!

997
01:26:57.522 --> 01:26:59.461
And view our numbers.

998
01:26:59.462 --> 01:27:02.058
Behold how our tribes
come together

999
01:27:02.527 --> 01:27:04.335
to draw the avenging sword.

1000
01:27:07.736 --> 01:27:10.538
On this spot...

1001
01:27:10.539 --> 01:27:12.441
- We must conquer!
- Yes!

1002
01:27:12.442 --> 01:27:15.808
Or die with glory.

1003
01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:20.076
There is no alternative!

1004
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:27.248
Boudica! Kill them all!

1005
01:27:42.606 --> 01:27:44.001
Attack!

1006
01:27:53.681 --> 01:27:54.781
Aaaaaaah!

1007
01:27:59.249 --> 01:28:02.151
Infantry, split the line!

1008
01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:04.790
Auxiliary...

1009
01:28:04.791 --> 01:28:05.923
Hold...

1010
01:28:05.924 --> 01:28:06.991
Hold!

1011
01:28:08.632 --> 01:28:09.829
Check your bearing!

1012
01:28:12.636 --> 01:28:14.536
Archers, forward!

1013
01:28:14.537 --> 01:28:15.570
Archers...

1014
01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:16.671
pull!

1015
01:28:42.897 --> 01:28:44.192
Turn the chariot over!

1016
01:28:44.193 --> 01:28:45.260
Turn it over!

1017
01:28:53.743 --> 01:28:54.874
Draw...

1018
01:29:10.562 --> 01:29:12.386
Draw... Loose!

1019
01:29:14.258 --> 01:29:15.565
Fire!

1020
01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:30.107
Fire!

1021
01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:44.957
Keep it coming, let's go.
Lay into them. Wipe them out!

1022
01:29:47.456 --> 01:29:50.534
Ask your daughters
for help, Boudica. Now!

1023
01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:54.229
Girls!

1024
01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:55.835
Are you going to help us?

1025
01:29:55.836 --> 01:29:58.333
The time for fighting
is over, Mother.

1026
01:29:59.138 --> 01:30:01.137
Then what?

1027
01:30:01.138 --> 01:30:02.810
It's time for you to join us.

1028
01:30:06.079 --> 01:30:07.276
What do they say?

1029
01:30:11.887 --> 01:30:15.724
After all we've been through,
I do <i>not</i> want to die cowering.

1030
01:30:18.487 --> 01:30:20.255
I go where you go.

1031
01:30:20.256 --> 01:30:21.664
On my command.

1032
01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:26.030
On your word, my queen.

1033
01:30:26.031 --> 01:30:28.704
Let's go.

1034
01:31:02.366 --> 01:31:03.804
Boudica!

1035
01:31:03.805 --> 01:31:05.004
Aaaaah!

1036
01:32:05.836 --> 01:32:07.066
Boudica!

1037
01:32:08.531 --> 01:32:09.904
Boudica!

1038
01:32:11.105 --> 01:32:13.907
You are, and you always will be,

1039
01:32:13.908 --> 01:32:15.008
my queen!

1040
01:32:40.673 --> 01:32:42.673
No!

1041
01:33:06.226 --> 01:33:08.929
Time to be a wife
and mother again.

1042
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:10.624
To love and to cherish.

1043
01:33:12.595 --> 01:33:14.803
Today, your name in sacrifice

1044
01:33:14.804 --> 01:33:17.466
is more important
than your victory in battle.

1045
01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:19.270
It's time to go, Mother.

1046
01:34:27.736 --> 01:34:29.340
