00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.065
All right, all right, all
right, what's it going to be?

2
00:02:48.282 --> 00:02:50.674
A triple cream cup for Christopher...

3
00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:53.371
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis...

4
00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.998
A Sizzler for June Marie...

5
00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:59.242
- And listen! Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

6
00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.895
This is called a Scrumdidilyumptious Bar.

7
00:03:02.107 --> 00:03:05.070
Scrumbibilyunctions Bar?
How does he do it?

8
00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:07.943
- My dear boy, do you ask a fish how it swims?
- No.

9
00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:09.723
- Or a bird how it flies?
- No.

10
00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:10.898
No sirree, you don't!

11
00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:12.855
They do it because they were
born to do it.

12
00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:15.942
Just like Willy Wonka was
born to be a candy man,

13
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.813
you look like you were
born to be a Wonkerer.

14
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.434
Me! Me!

15
00:05:25.584 --> 00:05:26.672
Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

16
00:05:27.107 --> 00:05:29.759
Ah, come along, Charlie.
You're late.

17
00:05:31.716 --> 00:05:33.369
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

18
00:05:33.543 --> 00:05:34.631
You're right.

19
00:05:35.414 --> 00:05:37.762
- There you are.
- Thanks.

20
00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:40.501
- Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
- Okay.

21
00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:25.949
Up the airy mountain.

22
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.383
Down the rushing glen.

23
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:30.733
We dare not go a-hunting.

24
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.037
For fear of little men.

25
00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:35.622
You see...

26
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:38.604
Nobody ever goes in...

27
00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:44.344
and nobody ever comes out!

28
00:06:54.826 --> 00:06:56.260
Charlie's late.

29
00:06:56.478 --> 00:06:59.131
He works too hard for a little boy.

30
00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.479
He should have some time to play.

31
00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.654
Not enough hours in the day.

32
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.112
With the four of you bedridden
for the past twenty years,

33
00:07:06.307 --> 00:07:09.134
it takes a lot of work
to keep this family going.

34
00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:11.656
If only his father were alive.

35
00:07:11.874 --> 00:07:15.484
Soon as I get my strength back, I'm
gonna get out of this bed and help him.

36
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.876
Dad, in all the years you've been saying
you're going to get out of that bed,

37
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.181
I've yet to see you set foot
on the floor.

38
00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:25.759
Well... maybe if the floor wasn't so cold.

39
00:07:27.182 --> 00:07:28.617
Hi, everybody!

40
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.052
Wake up. Charlie's home!

41
00:07:33.358 --> 00:07:34.618
Grandpa George.

42
00:07:36.359 --> 00:07:37.968
Grandma Georgina.

43
00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.837
Grandma Josephine.

44
00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:43.056
Grandpa Joe.

45
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:47.578
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

46
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.666
Well, it's yours too, Charlie.

47
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.536
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

48
00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:53.914
- Charlie!
- It's all we have.

49
00:07:54.059 --> 00:07:55.755
What are you saying?

50
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.321
- How about this?
- Charlie, where'd you get that?

51
00:07:59.538 --> 00:08:02.669
What difference does it make where
he got it? Point is: He got it.

52
00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:04.366
It's my first pay day.

53
00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:07.367
Good for you, Charlie.
We'll have a real banquet.

54
00:08:07.584 --> 00:08:08.758
Mom...?

55
00:08:09.106 --> 00:08:12.107
Here's what's left. You keep it.

56
00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:14.369
Except for this.

57
00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.282
From now on, I'm going to
pay for your tobacco.

58
00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:21.892
No one's going to pay for it, Charlie.
I'm giving it up.

59
00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:24.544
Come on, Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

60
00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:28.242
When a loaf of bread looks like a
banquet, I've no right buying tobacco.

61
00:08:28.459 --> 00:08:30.242
Go on, Grandpa.

62
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.591
Please take it.

63
00:08:39.114 --> 00:08:43.340
After I finished my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

64
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:45.816
There was this strange man there.

65
00:08:46.072 --> 00:08:47.769
I think he was a tinker.

66
00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:51.378
He was standing right behind me,
looking up at the factory.

67
00:08:51.595 --> 00:08:53.727
Just before he left he said,

68
00:08:53.944 --> 00:08:57.205
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out."

69
00:08:57.423 --> 00:08:59.424
And right he was, Charlie.

70
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.251
Not since the tragic day
that Willy Wonka locked it.

71
00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:03.555
Why'd he lock it?

72
00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:07.121
Because all the other chocolate makers
in the world were sending in spies,

73
00:09:07.295 --> 00:09:10.774
dressed as workers, to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

74
00:09:10.992 --> 00:09:14.949
Especially Slugworth... Oh,
that Slugworth, he was the worst!

75
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.124
Finally Mr. Wonka shouted
"I shall be ruined!"

76
00:09:18.342 --> 00:09:22.255
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

77
00:09:22.473 --> 00:09:25.995
He locked the gates and
vanished completely.

78
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.127
And then suddenly, about three years later,

79
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.911
the most amazing thing happened.

80
00:09:32.128 --> 00:09:34.737
The factory started working
again, full blast!

81
00:09:34.954 --> 00:09:38.304
And more delicious candies were
coming out than ever before.

82
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.652
But the gates stayed
locked so that no one,

83
00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:44.610
not even Mr. Slugworth, could steal them.

84
00:09:44.827 --> 00:09:48.828
But Grandpa, someone must be
helping Mr. Wonka work the factory.

85
00:09:49.002 --> 00:09:50.829
Thousands must be helping him.

86
00:09:51.003 --> 00:09:52.003
But who?

87
00:09:52.177 --> 00:09:53.872
Who are they?

88
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:57.439
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

89
00:09:59.613 --> 00:10:01.831
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

90
00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:04.223
I shall need an assistant.
Come and give me a hand.

91
00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:09.312
We have here nitric acid, glycerine...

92
00:10:09.486 --> 00:10:11.616
and a special mixture of
my own.

93
00:10:11.834 --> 00:10:14.617
Together it's horrible, dangerous stuff.
Blows you up.

94
00:10:14.835 --> 00:10:18.836
But mixed together in the right way, as
only I know how, what do you think it makes?

95
00:10:19.054 --> 00:10:20.639
- I don't know, sir.
- Of course you don't know.

96
00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:22.141
You don't know
because only I know.

97
00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:25.838
If you knew and I didn't know, then you'd
be teaching me instead of me teaching you.

98
00:10:26.055 --> 00:10:30.665
And for a student to teach his teacher is
presumptuous and rude. Do I make myself clear?

99
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.144
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

100
00:10:32.361 --> 00:10:36.710
Now, mixed together in the right way
these three highly dangerous ingredients

101
00:10:36.884 --> 00:10:39.146
make the finest wart remover in the world.

102
00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:42.147
The trick is to pour them in in
equal amount.

103
00:10:42.363 --> 00:10:45.625
Now, Charlie, you take the
nitric acid and the glycerine,

104
00:10:45.843 --> 00:10:48.713
and I'll take my own special
mixture. You ready?

105
00:10:48.888 --> 00:10:51.062
Good lad. Pour.

106
00:10:53.193 --> 00:10:54.628
Did we do it wrong?

107
00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:57.542
No, certainly not. This
is for very big warts.

108
00:10:58.368 --> 00:11:00.369
Now what's going on out there?

109
00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:05.239
You, Winkelmann, come here.
What's happening?

110
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.730
Willy Wonka's opening his factory.
He's gonna let people in.

111
00:11:08.022 --> 00:11:08.937
Are you sure?

112
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:11.536
It's on the radio. And he's giving
truckloads of chocolate away.

113
00:11:11.676 --> 00:11:13.850
- Class dismissed!
- No, no, it's only for five people.

114
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.547
Class un-dismissed.

115
00:11:16.721 --> 00:11:19.828
He's hidden five Golden Tickets, and the
people who find them will win the big prize.

116
00:11:19.852 --> 00:11:21.071
Where's he hidden the tickets?

117
00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.972
Inside five Wonka Bars! You
gotta buy Wonka Bars to find 'em!

118
00:11:24.022 --> 00:11:25.972
Class re-dismissed!

119
00:11:37.073 --> 00:11:39.161
And now, details on the sudden announcement

120
00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:41.901
that has captured the
attention of entire world.

121
00:11:42.075 --> 00:11:44.728
Hidden among the countless
billions of Wonka Bars

122
00:11:44.946 --> 00:11:46.859
are five gold tickets,

123
00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:51.425
and to the five people who find them will come
the most fabulous prize one could wish for:

124
00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:53.947
A lifetime supply of chocolate.

125
00:11:54.122 --> 00:11:57.862
And as if this were not enough,
each winner before he receives his prize

126
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.056
will be personally escorted through
the top secret chocolate factory.

127
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.428
They're all crazy!

128
00:12:01.602 --> 00:12:02.950
Sssshhh! The man's a genius!

129
00:12:03.124 --> 00:12:04.777
He'll sell a million bars.

130
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.560
Grandpa, do you think I've got a
chance to find one?

131
00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:11.474
One? I'm counting on you to find all five!

132
00:12:11.735 --> 00:12:13.039
One's enough for me.

133
00:12:13.115 --> 00:12:14.577
Already we have reports coming in

134
00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:16.460
that the response is phenomenal.

135
00:12:16.514 --> 00:12:18.444
Wonka Bars are beginning to disappear

136
00:12:18.475 --> 00:12:21.694
from candy store shelves at
a rate to boggle the mind.

137
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:23.390
Truly it is incredible,

138
00:12:23.607 --> 00:12:26.391
the way that Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.

139
00:12:26.608 --> 00:12:29.576
While the world searches, we
watch and wait,

140
00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:33.914
wondering where the pursuit will lead and
how long the spirit of man will hold up

141
00:12:33.991 --> 00:12:35.079
under the strain.

142
00:12:35.437 --> 00:12:39.568
I'm still having these dreams, Doctor, and I
still can't stop myself from believing them.

143
00:12:39.786 --> 00:12:41.656
I've told you, Mr. Hofstedder,

144
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.656
to believe in one's dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

145
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.657
And the sooner you accept this,
the sooner you will get well.

146
00:12:48.266 --> 00:12:52.964
But I dreamed the Archangel appeared and whispered into
my ear and told me where to find a Golden Wonka Ticket.

147
00:12:53.964 --> 00:12:55.312
And what exactly did he say?

148
00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:58.617
Well what difference does that
make? This was a dream, a fantasy.

149
00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:02.234
- I mean, you said just now...
- Shut up, Hofstedder, and tell me where the ticket is!

150
00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.271
We began with five Golden Tickets,

151
00:13:04.488 --> 00:13:09.098
like five lucky bolts of lightning ready to
strike without notice at any point on the map.

152
00:13:09.316 --> 00:13:12.186
No one knew where, no one knew when the
first one would hit.

153
00:13:12.359 --> 00:13:14.839
But as you all know, last
night we got our answer.

154
00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:18.361
While we in America slept, the
first golden ticket was found

155
00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:21.623
in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

156
00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:26.320
We've been waiting several hours for the follow-up
story and we're finally ready with a live report.

157
00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.886
Proud we are, for the attention
of the entire world

158
00:13:30.016 --> 00:13:32.148
focuses today right here in Duselheim.

159
00:13:32.365 --> 00:13:34.887
A community suddenly thrust into prominence

160
00:13:35.018 --> 00:13:38.671
by the unexpected discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

161
00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:41.889
Its lucky finder is the son of our
most prominent parve butcher.

162
00:13:42.063 --> 00:13:44.759
The boy's name?
Augustus Gloop.

163
00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:50.022
Augustus Gloop, the pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany,

164
00:13:50.239 --> 00:13:53.067
an example for the whole world.

165
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.241
Augustus, how does it make you feel
to be the first Golden Ticket finder?

166
00:13:56.415 --> 00:13:58.024
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

167
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:01.242
Feel sorry for Wonka.
It's gonna cost him a fortune in fudge.

168
00:14:01.677 --> 00:14:03.851
Mr. Gloop, would you mind saying...

169
00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:07.982
Mrs. Gloop, would you care to say a few
words to the television audience?

170
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.071
I just knew Augustus would find a Golden
Ticket. Eating is his hobby, you know.

171
00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:13.465
We encourage him...

172
00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:20.900
Happy Birthday, Charlie!

173
00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:24.248
Here you are, Charlie.

174
00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:25.900
Thank you.

175
00:14:32.598 --> 00:14:33.599
It's terrific.

176
00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:37.034
We each knitted a bit: Grandma
Georgina, Grandma Josephine, and me.

177
00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:39.731
I did the end pieces
with the little tassels.

178
00:14:39.948 --> 00:14:43.253
And here's a little gift from
Grandpa George and me.

179
00:14:43.427 --> 00:14:45.775
I think I know what this is.

180
00:14:46.775 --> 00:14:49.385
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

181
00:14:49.602 --> 00:14:50.950
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

182
00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:53.685
- Wouldn't that be fantastic?
- It's not fair to raise his hopes.

183
00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:56.778
Never mind. Go on, open it, Charlie.
I want to see that gold.

184
00:14:56.952 --> 00:14:58.214
Stop it, Dad.

185
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:03.475
- I've got the same chance as anybody else, haven't I?
- You've got more, Charlie, because you want it more.

186
00:15:03.737 --> 00:15:05.128
Go on, open it.

187
00:15:05.302 --> 00:15:06.911
Here goes.

188
00:15:09.738 --> 00:15:11.130
- I got it!
- Where? Where?

189
00:15:11.609 --> 00:15:12.609
Let's see!

190
00:15:12.913 --> 00:15:14.784
Fooled you, didn't I?

191
00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:16.914
You thought I really had it.

192
00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:20.393
Never mind, Charlie.

193
00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:22.133
You'll find one.

194
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.960
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No no no, you eat it.

195
00:15:38.093 --> 00:15:40.877
I wanted to be the first to find
a Golden Ticket, Daddy.

196
00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:44.313
I know, Angel.
We're doing the best we can.

197
00:15:44.486 --> 00:15:47.226
I've got every girl on the
bleeding staff hunting for you.

198
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:49.618
All right, where is it?
Why haven't they found it?

199
00:15:49.836 --> 00:15:52.968
Veruca, sweetheart, I'm not a magician!

200
00:15:53.445 --> 00:15:54.489
Give me time!

201
00:15:54.663 --> 00:15:57.794
I want it now! What's the matter
with those twerps down there?

202
00:15:58.012 --> 00:16:01.491
For five days now the entire
flipping factory's been on the job.

203
00:16:01.665 --> 00:16:04.405
They haven't shelled a peanut
in there since Monday.

204
00:16:04.622 --> 00:16:08.102
They've been shelling flaming
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk.

205
00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:09.668
Make 'em work nights.

206
00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:13.451
Come along, come along,
you girls,

207
00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:16.495
put a jack in it or you'll be out
on your ears, every one of you!

208
00:16:16.756 --> 00:16:17.818
And listen to this.

209
00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:23.105
The first girl that finds a Golden Ticket
gets a one pound bonus in her pay bucket!

210
00:16:23.323 --> 00:16:25.019
What do you think of that?

211
00:16:27.107 --> 00:16:28.542
They're not even trying.

212
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.108
They don't want to find it.
They're jealous of me.

213
00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:33.500
Sweetheart, I can't push 'em no harder.

214
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.066
Nineteen thousand bars
an hour they're shelling.

215
00:16:36.283 --> 00:16:38.631
Seven hundred and sixty
thousand they've done so far.

216
00:16:38.849 --> 00:16:39.893
You promised, Daddy!

217
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.719
You promised I'd have
it the very first day!

218
00:16:42.936 --> 00:16:46.807
You're going to very unpopular around here,
Henry, if you don't deliver soon.

219
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:50.330
It breaks my heart, Henrietta.
I hate to see her unhappy.

220
00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:52.069
I won't talk to you ever again.

221
00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:55.593
You're a rotten, mean father.
You never give me anything I want.

222
00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.593
And I won't go to school 'til I have it.

223
00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:00.376
Veruca, sweetheart, angel...

224
00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:03.334
Now. There are only four
tickets left in the whole world,

225
00:17:03.551 --> 00:17:06.161
and the whole ruddy
world's hunting for them.

226
00:17:06.377 --> 00:17:07.377
What can I do?

227
00:17:08.465 --> 00:17:10.727
I got it! I got it, Mr. Salt, here it is!

228
00:17:12.728 --> 00:17:15.641
It's about time too! I want it!

229
00:17:20.555 --> 00:17:23.512
Give me that ticket! It's mine!

230
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.209
I've found a Golden Ticket!

231
00:17:31.906 --> 00:17:32.950
Thank God for that.

232
00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:36.299
Aye. Happiness is what
counts with children.

233
00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.560
Happiness and harmony.

234
00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:43.778
This, ladies and gentlemen, is the sign of
our times, the symbol of the havoc,

235
00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:46.693
the mad craze that's
sweeping the world today.

236
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.042
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever of the five continents we're on,

237
00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:54.006
the great search for
Wonka Bars continues.

238
00:17:54.107 --> 00:17:58.373
We're now nearing the end of our forty-third
day in the hunt for Golden Tickets,

239
00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.509
and everywhere we're beginning
to see signs of anxiety.

240
00:18:02.001 --> 00:18:03.132
Every hour on the hour,

241
00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:06.002
new shipments are being sent to
different points around the globe,

242
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.351
but they're just not moving fast enough.

243
00:18:08.612 --> 00:18:13.003
And as time passes, the men who seek
them become more and more desperate.

244
00:18:13.178 --> 00:18:17.310
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've
all been during these last few days,

245
00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:19.919
but now I think I can safely say

246
00:18:20.137 --> 00:18:22.833
that your time and money
have been well spent.

247
00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:27.051
We're about to witness the greatest
miracle of the machine age.

248
00:18:27.269 --> 00:18:31.095
Based on the revolutionary Computonian
Law of Probability this machine

249
00:18:31.313 --> 00:18:35.358
will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining.

250
00:18:35.793 --> 00:18:37.446
Golden Tickets.

251
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.926
It says:

252
00:18:47.144 --> 00:18:49.971
"I won't tell. That
would be cheating."

253
00:18:56.406 --> 00:18:58.712
I am now telling the computer that,

254
00:18:58.886 --> 00:19:02.930
if it will tell me the correct answer,
I will gladly share with it

255
00:19:03.147 --> 00:19:04.930
the grand prize.

256
00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:10.193
He says:

257
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:15.151
"What would a computer do with
a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

258
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:24.240
I am now telling the computer exactly what he
can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate.

259
00:19:26.675 --> 00:19:29.894
And it can happen right here too,
unbelievable as it sounds

260
00:19:30.111 --> 00:19:31.721
right here in America.

261
00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:36.591
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest of dreams can come true.

262
00:19:36.722 --> 00:19:38.026
Because folks, here she is.

263
00:19:38.374 --> 00:19:42.071
Miss Violet Beauregarde, finder of
Wonka's Golden Ticket Number Three,

264
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:43.984
from Miles City, Montana.

265
00:19:44.202 --> 00:19:45.594
And with her, the proud parents:

266
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:49.127
Mr. Beauregarde, a prominent local politician,
a great civic leader, a philosopher...

267
00:19:49.203 --> 00:19:51.404
Hi, folks, Sam Beauregarde here,
Square Deal Sam to you,

268
00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:53.465
with all of today's great
give-away bargains.

269
00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.086
The finest values you'll get
anywhere in the entire country.

270
00:19:56.292 --> 00:19:58.616
- Now this little number right here's a four door sedan...
- Come on, Dad, they don't want you!

271
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.704
- Violet, would you care to say a few words to the nation?
- Sure I will.

272
00:20:00.728 --> 00:20:03.335
Here it is, Golden Ticket Number
Three, and it's all mine.

273
00:20:03.366 --> 00:20:04.646
Tell us how it happened, Violet.

274
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:08.098
Well I'm a gum-chewer, normally, but when I
heard about these ticket things of Wonka's,

275
00:20:08.122 --> 00:20:10.252
I laid off the gum and
switched to candy bars instead.

276
00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.862
Now, of course, I'm right back on gum.

277
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:15.863
I chew it all day except at meal
times when I stick it behind my ear.

278
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.602
- Violet...
- Cool it, Mother.

279
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:22.690
Now this piece of gum here is one that I've been chewing
on for three months solid, and that's a world record.

280
00:20:22.907 --> 00:20:26.126
It's beaten the record held by my best
friend Miss Cornelia Prinzmetel,

281
00:20:26.343 --> 00:20:28.126
and was she mad!

282
00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:29.779
Hi, Cornelia, how are you sweetie?

283
00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:34.277
Let me just butt in here for a moment to say that if
any of you folks watching are dissatisfied with your...

284
00:20:43.856 --> 00:20:47.795
- Charlie, what are you doing here?
- I thought if you were ready, I'd walk you home.

285
00:20:48.001 --> 00:20:51.132
I wish I were, but it looks like I'm
gonna be here late tonight.

286
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.959
Oh, well, then I guess I'll be going.

287
00:20:54.177 --> 00:20:55.916
Well why don't you stay a minute?

288
00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.178
Here, pull up a pile of
clothes and sit down.

289
00:21:01.788 --> 00:21:03.309
Everything all right at school?

290
00:21:03.527 --> 00:21:04.310
Yep.

291
00:21:04.527 --> 00:21:05.615
Good.

292
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.050
Go on your newspaper route today?

293
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:09.267
Just finished.

294
00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:10.529
Good.

295
00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:15.269
I wanted to tell you something.

296
00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.836
They found the third ticket today.

297
00:21:20.053 --> 00:21:21.315
Did they?

298
00:21:21.756 --> 00:21:22.866
Yeah.

299
00:21:23.451 --> 00:21:24.451
Well...

300
00:21:25.055 --> 00:21:26.708
Guess I'll be going now.

301
00:21:28.056 --> 00:21:29.230
Is that all?

302
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.361
Well I thought you'd like to know.

303
00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:36.188
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

304
00:21:36.406 --> 00:21:39.580
There are only two tickets
left, you know. Just two.

305
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.624
Pretty soon just one.

306
00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:43.538
I wonder who the lucky ones will be.

307
00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:45.949
Well in case you're wondering
if it'll be me, it won't be.

308
00:21:45.973 --> 00:21:48.887
Just in case you're wondering,
you can count me out.

309
00:21:49.142 --> 00:21:52.453
Charlie, there are a hundred
billion people in this world,

310
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.801
and only five of them
will find Golden Tickets.

311
00:21:56.019 --> 00:21:59.194
Even if you had a sackful of money
you probably wouldn't find one.

312
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:04.065
And after this contest is over, you'll be no different
from the billions of others who didn't find one.

313
00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:07.066
But I am different. I want it
more than any of them.

314
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.457
Charlie, you'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

315
00:22:11.675 --> 00:22:14.024
When? When will they change?

316
00:22:14.285 --> 00:22:16.590
Probably when you least expect it.

317
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:20.939
See you later.

318
00:25:00.502 --> 00:25:02.302
While the rest of the world
goes on searching,

319
00:25:02.416 --> 00:25:04.257
here in the Southwest
it has actually happened.

320
00:25:04.677 --> 00:25:08.548
That's what I said, friends. There's only
one Golden Ticket left in the entire world,

321
00:25:08.766 --> 00:25:12.244
because right here in our own
community of Marble Falls, Arizona,

322
00:25:12.462 --> 00:25:14.245
is lucky winner number four.

323
00:25:14.462 --> 00:25:18.246
Now, the name soon to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee.

324
00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.440
Hey, Mike, do you think we
might shut that thing off?

325
00:25:20.464 --> 00:25:23.247
- No, are you crazy?
- He won't answer 'til the station break.

326
00:25:23.465 --> 00:25:25.703
Mike, the country wants to hear
from you. The world is waiting...

327
00:25:25.727 --> 00:25:27.814
Can't you shut up? I'm busy.

328
00:25:28.031 --> 00:25:29.162
Boy, what a great show.

329
00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:31.162
I serve all his TV dinners right here.

330
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.859
He's never even been to the table.

331
00:25:32.981 --> 00:25:34.860
- You love to watch TV, Mike?
- You bet.

332
00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:36.686
What about that Golden Ticket, Mike?

333
00:25:36.903 --> 00:25:38.252
Hold it! I wanna catch this.

334
00:25:38.469 --> 00:25:41.427
- You like the killings, huh?
- What do you think life's all about?

335
00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:43.383
Mike, would you tell us...

336
00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:46.514
Wait 'til I get a real one.

337
00:25:46.732 --> 00:25:47.820
Colt 45.

338
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.254
Pop won't let me have
one yet, will you, Pop?

339
00:25:50.472 --> 00:25:52.472
Not 'til you're twelve, son.

340
00:25:58.996 --> 00:26:00.866
Four down, and one to go.

341
00:26:01.084 --> 00:26:05.215
And somewhere out there, another lucky
person is moving closer and closer

342
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:10.173
to finding the last of the most
sought after prizes in history.

343
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.304
Though we cannot help but
envy him, whoever he is,

344
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:16.478
and we might be tempted
to be bitter in our losing,

345
00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:19.653
we must remember there are
many more important things,

346
00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:22.248
many more important things.

347
00:26:22.698 --> 00:26:26.438
Offhand I can't think of what they are,
but I'm sure there must be something.

348
00:26:26.699 --> 00:26:28.721
And now for tomorrow's weather and...

349
00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:33.787
Why'd you wake me up, Grandpa?
Is something wrong?

350
00:26:39.703 --> 00:26:41.877
Grandpa, that money was for tobacco.

351
00:26:42.137 --> 00:26:44.225
I told you, Charlie, I've given it up.

352
00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:45.835
Go on, open it.

353
00:26:46.052 --> 00:26:48.095
One ticket left. Now
let's see some of that gold.

354
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.619
No, you do it. I can't.

355
00:26:51.705 --> 00:26:53.923
Something tells me we're
gonna be lucky this time.

356
00:26:54.141 --> 00:26:56.533
I've got a funny feeling inside.

357
00:26:58.403 --> 00:27:00.708
Which end shall I open first?

358
00:27:01.882 --> 00:27:03.970
That end. Just a tiny bit.

359
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:08.319
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

360
00:27:09.493 --> 00:27:12.406
- You finish it. I can't.
- No, Grandpa, you do it.

361
00:27:12.885 --> 00:27:14.233
All right,

362
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:16.060
here goes.

363
00:27:22.322 --> 00:27:23.496
You know...

364
00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:28.498
I bet those Golden Tickets make
the chocolate taste terrible.

365
00:27:38.762 --> 00:27:40.849
Lot 403.

366
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.458
I can personally guarantee,
ladies and gentlemen,

367
00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:47.372
that this is the one and only, the
absolutely last case of Wonka Bars

368
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:49.155
left in the United Kingdom.

369
00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:53.113
Shall we start the bidding at one thousand
pounds? Do I hear one thousand pounds?

370
00:27:53.896 --> 00:27:55.070
Fifteen hundred pounds?

371
00:27:55.288 --> 00:27:56.193
Two thousand?

372
00:27:56.248 --> 00:27:58.114
I have two thousand five hundred here.

373
00:27:58.374 --> 00:27:59.631
Four thousand pounds?

374
00:27:59.854 --> 00:28:01.332
Forty-five hundred pounds!

375
00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.159
Five thousand pou...

376
00:28:03.377 --> 00:28:05.030
Your Majesty!

377
00:28:08.552 --> 00:28:10.248
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

378
00:28:10.465 --> 00:28:12.825
Doesn't seem to be anything
in his papers to give us a clue.

379
00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:14.901
They kidnapped my husband twelve hours ago.

380
00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:17.280
When are we going to hear from them?
What do they want?

381
00:28:17.381 --> 00:28:21.033
Try to stay calm. They did it for ransom.
All we can do is wait to hear their demands.

382
00:28:21.556 --> 00:28:23.773
I'll give them anything,
anything they want!

383
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.817
All I want is to have Harold back!

384
00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.645
Go ahead, we're listening.

385
00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.908
What did they ask for?
Whatever it is, they can have it.

386
00:28:41.822 --> 00:28:44.344
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

387
00:28:49.563 --> 00:28:51.259
Mrs. Curtis, did you hear me?

388
00:28:52.085 --> 00:28:54.999
It's your husband's life or
your case of Wonka Bars.

389
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.348
How long will they
give me to think it over?

390
00:29:00.087 --> 00:29:01.087
That's it, that's it!

391
00:29:01.262 --> 00:29:03.697
It's all over!
The Wonka Contest is all over!

392
00:29:03.915 --> 00:29:05.958
The fifth and final ticket has been found,

393
00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:10.612
and we've got a live report coming in
directly now from Paraguay, South America.

394
00:29:10.786 --> 00:29:13.221
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is finished.
The end has come.

395
00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:16.135
The fifth and last Golden
Ticket has just been found,

396
00:29:16.352 --> 00:29:17.744
right here in Paraguay.

397
00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:20.919
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta,

398
00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:24.920
the multimillionaire owner of gambling
casinos throughout South America.

399
00:29:25.094 --> 00:29:28.573
Here is the most recent picture
of Alberto the happy finder.

400
00:29:30.008 --> 00:29:31.313
Turn it off.

401
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.748
Well, that's that.

402
00:29:34.966 --> 00:29:36.488
No more Golden Tickets.

403
00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:38.749
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

404
00:29:38.967 --> 00:29:40.358
Not to Charlie it wasn't.

405
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.447
A little boy's got to have something in this
world to hope for. What's he got to hope for now?

406
00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.707
Who's going to tell him?

407
00:29:47.761 --> 00:29:50.840
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

408
00:29:51.057 --> 00:29:52.536
Yeah, let him sleep.

409
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:55.145
Let him have one last dream.

410
00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:05.713
I've just decided to switch our
Friday schedule to Monday,

411
00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:09.541
which means that the test we take each
Friday on what we learned during the week

412
00:30:09.757 --> 00:30:12.019
will now take place on Monday
before we've learned it.

413
00:30:12.237 --> 00:30:14.717
But since today is Tuesday,
it doesn't matter in the slightest.

414
00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:16.673
Pencils ready.

415
00:30:18.238 --> 00:30:21.152
Today we are going to learn about...

416
00:30:22.761 --> 00:30:23.761
percentages.

417
00:30:23.849 --> 00:30:27.458
And for an example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

418
00:30:27.675 --> 00:30:30.720
Supposing that there were a thousand
Wonka Bars in the world,

419
00:30:30.937 --> 00:30:34.721
and during the contest you each
opened a certain number of them.

420
00:30:34.938 --> 00:30:37.113
That number is...

421
00:30:37.417 --> 00:30:39.113
a percent. Everyone understand?

422
00:30:41.505 --> 00:30:44.027
You, Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

423
00:30:44.593 --> 00:30:45.680
About a hundred.

424
00:30:46.028 --> 00:30:50.986
There are ten hundreds in a thousand.
Therefore you opened ten percent.

425
00:30:51.465 --> 00:30:53.725
You, Peter Goff, how many did you open?

426
00:30:53.943 --> 00:30:55.204
A hundred and fifty.

427
00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.423
That's ten percent half over again, which
makes fifteen percent. Charlie Bucket.

428
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:02.815
- How many did you open?
- Two.

429
00:31:03.033 --> 00:31:05.555
That's easy. Two hundred
is twice one hundred...

430
00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:07.251
Not two hundred.

431
00:31:07.817 --> 00:31:08.860
Just two.

432
00:31:09.469 --> 00:31:12.208
Two? What do you mean
you only opened two?

433
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:14.688
I don't care very much for chocolate.

434
00:31:14.905 --> 00:31:16.775
Well I can't figure out just two,

435
00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:19.124
so let's pretend you opened two hundred.

436
00:31:19.298 --> 00:31:23.603
Now, if you opened two hundred Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick,

437
00:31:23.821 --> 00:31:25.623
you'd have used up twenty
percent of one thousand,

438
00:31:25.647 --> 00:31:28.561
which is fifteen percent half
over again, ten percent...

439
00:32:17.457 --> 00:32:18.183
Hi.

440
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.184
I'd like a bar of chocolate please.

441
00:32:20.314 --> 00:32:21.444
Yeah, sure.

442
00:32:21.662 --> 00:32:22.749
What kind?

443
00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:25.924
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdidilyumptious?

444
00:32:26.142 --> 00:32:29.143
- Whichever's the biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdidilyumptious.

445
00:32:30.012 --> 00:32:33.186
Now that all the tickets have been found,
I don't have to hide them anymore.

446
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.756
Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

447
00:32:47.973 --> 00:32:50.148
You'll get a stomach ache
if you swallow it like that.

448
00:32:50.495 --> 00:32:52.366
- Bye.
- Bye now.

449
00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:03.499
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

450
00:33:03.717 --> 00:33:05.021
Sure.

451
00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:07.978
Why not try a regular Wonka Bar this time?

452
00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.501
Fine.

453
00:33:20.506 --> 00:33:25.505
- All right, all right, take it easy. One at a time.
- Did you hear the news?

454
00:33:25.766 --> 00:33:28.070
That gambler from Paraguay
made up a phony ticket.

455
00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:31.419
That means there's one Golden Ticket
still floating around somewhere.

456
00:33:31.594 --> 00:33:34.551
Can you imagine the nerve of that guy,
trying to fool the whole world?

457
00:33:35.076 --> 00:33:39.247
Aw, he really was a crook! Well this
means the contest goes on forever.

458
00:34:22.422 --> 00:34:25.280
Hey, you've got it!
You've got the last Golden Ticket!

459
00:34:25.304 --> 00:34:28.130
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

460
00:34:31.265 --> 00:34:34.001
Stand back there.
Leave the boy alone!

461
00:34:36.828 --> 00:34:38.176
Break it up.

462
00:34:39.003 --> 00:34:41.529
Come on, Charlie! Hold on to that ticket!

463
00:34:41.655 --> 00:34:44.091
Run for it, Charlie!
Run straight home,

464
00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.164
and don't stop 'til you get there!

465
00:35:18.012 --> 00:35:19.621
I congratulate you, little boy.

466
00:35:19.839 --> 00:35:21.057
Well done.

467
00:35:21.492 --> 00:35:23.970
You found the fifth Golden Ticket.

468
00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:26.015
May I introduce myself?

469
00:35:26.232 --> 00:35:27.798
Arthur Slugworth.

470
00:35:28.015 --> 00:35:30.581
President of Slugworth
Chocolates, Incorporated.

471
00:35:31.407 --> 00:35:35.321
Now listen carefully because I'm
going to make you very rich indeed.

472
00:35:35.539 --> 00:35:39.236
Mr. Wonka is at this moment
working on a fantastic invention:

473
00:35:39.757 --> 00:35:42.019
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

474
00:35:42.715 --> 00:35:44.715
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

475
00:35:44.889 --> 00:35:48.195
So all I want you to do is to get hold
of just one Everlasting Gobstopper,

476
00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:51.761
and bring it to me so that I
can find the secret formula.

477
00:35:52.065 --> 00:35:55.675
Your reward will be ten
thousand of these.

478
00:35:55.892 --> 00:35:57.501
Think it over, will you?

479
00:35:57.763 --> 00:35:59.720
A new house for your family,

480
00:35:59.937 --> 00:36:03.198
and good food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

481
00:36:04.068 --> 00:36:05.851
And don't forget the name:

482
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:08.287
Everlasting Gobstopper.

483
00:36:37.642 --> 00:36:40.817
Look, everyone, look, I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!

484
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.730
You're pulling our legs, Charlie!

485
00:36:43.948 --> 00:36:46.269
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

486
00:36:46.324 --> 00:36:49.429
No, Grandpa, the last one was a fake.
It said so in the papers.

487
00:36:49.472 --> 00:36:53.081
I found some money in the street, and I
bought a Wonka Bar, and the ticket was in it.

488
00:36:53.256 --> 00:36:55.604
Look at it, Grandpa, see for yourself!

489
00:36:56.169 --> 00:36:58.605
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

490
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:03.431
"Greetings to you, the lucky
finder of this Golden Ticket,"

491
00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:07.606
"from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates"

492
00:37:07.824 --> 00:37:12.086
"at ten o'clock in the morning of the first
day of October, and do not be late."

493
00:37:12.304 --> 00:37:17.088
"You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else."

494
00:37:17.305 --> 00:37:20.436
"In your wildest dreams
you could not imagine"

495
00:37:20.609 --> 00:37:23.469
"the marvellous surprises that await you!"

496
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.875
- Charlie, you've done it!
- I can't believe it.

497
00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:29.917
Grandpa? It says I can take
somebody with me.

498
00:37:30.134 --> 00:37:31.787
I wish you could go.

499
00:37:42.312 --> 00:37:43.442
Charlie.

500
00:37:49.423 --> 00:37:52.140
Ah, that's good, Charlie.

501
00:37:52.314 --> 00:37:53.880
Now help me up.

502
00:38:07.362 --> 00:38:08.448
Are you okay?

503
00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:10.710
Oh yeah, I'm fine, Charlie.

504
00:38:18.049 --> 00:38:19.049
Joe!

505
00:38:20.791 --> 00:38:22.235
Watch it, Joe!

506
00:38:31.411 --> 00:38:32.890
Look at me!

507
00:38:35.934 --> 00:38:37.761
Look at me!

508
00:38:38.413 --> 00:38:40.414
Up and about...

509
00:38:42.066 --> 00:38:45.372
I haven't done this in twenty years.

510
00:38:46.402 --> 00:38:47.550
Grandpa!

511
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:39.429
It's ours, Charlie!

512
00:39:43.778 --> 00:39:45.431
Slippers, Charlie!

513
00:40:05.741 --> 00:40:07.741
The cane, Charlie!

514
00:40:12.525 --> 00:40:14.091
Here I go!

515
00:40:15.004 --> 00:40:16.830
Watch my speed!

516
00:40:59.798 --> 00:41:02.799
Good morning! Look at the sun!

517
00:41:40.418 --> 00:41:43.810
Stop! It says the first of
October. That's tomorrow!

518
00:41:44.027 --> 00:41:48.147
Jumping Crocodiles, Charlie! We've got a lot to do.
Comb your hair, wash your face, polish your shoes...

519
00:41:48.289 --> 00:41:51.334
- I'll take care of everything, Dad.
- We don't have too much time.

520
00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:56.553
Grandpa... On the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

521
00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:22.081
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

522
00:42:22.298 --> 00:42:24.255
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

523
00:42:24.473 --> 00:42:27.126
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!

524
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.300
How do I look?

525
00:42:28.386 --> 00:42:29.865
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, you're on.

526
00:42:30.083 --> 00:42:31.843
Well, this is it folks.
This is the big day,

527
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:36.780
the historic day on which Willy Wonka has promised to
open his gates and shower gifts on the five lucky winners.

528
00:42:36.998 --> 00:42:40.302
From all over the globe, people have
gathered here waiting for the hour to strike,

529
00:42:40.477 --> 00:42:43.738
waiting to catch a glimpse of that
legendary magician Mr. Willy Wonka.

530
00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:49.890
Hi, friends. Sam Beauregarde here. The next time
you're in Miles City, Montana, don't forget to visit...

531
00:42:49.914 --> 00:42:52.785
Cut it out, Dad. For heaven's
sake, this is my show!

532
00:42:53.002 --> 00:42:56.829
Hi, Cornelia sweetie, I've still got it.
And how's this for a stretch?

533
00:43:10.006 --> 00:43:12.312
I want to go in first before anybody else.

534
00:43:12.528 --> 00:43:14.355
Anything you say, sweetheart.

535
00:43:17.617 --> 00:43:21.053
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.

536
00:43:23.967 --> 00:43:27.663
Grandpa? I don't believe it. We did it.
We're actually going in.

537
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.620
We're going to see the greatest
of them all: Mr. Willy Wonka!

538
00:45:13.249 --> 00:45:17.910
Thank you. Thank you.

539
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.128
Welcome, my friends.

540
00:45:20.389 --> 00:45:22.388
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

541
00:45:23.085 --> 00:45:24.303
Would you come forward please?

542
00:45:25.477 --> 00:45:27.678
Veruca first! Get back, you!
Come on, Veruca sweetheart!

543
00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:35.957
That's Slugworth! That's the
one I've told you about!

544
00:45:40.611 --> 00:45:43.481
Welcome. It's nice to have you here.

545
00:45:43.872 --> 00:45:45.308
I'm so glad you could come.

546
00:45:45.482 --> 00:45:49.396
This is going to be such an
exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

547
00:45:49.788 --> 00:45:51.310
I think you will.

548
00:45:51.657 --> 00:45:53.789
And now would you please
show me your Golden Tickets?

549
00:45:54.876 --> 00:45:56.311
I'm Veruca Salt.

550
00:45:56.485 --> 00:45:58.616
My dear Veruca, what a pleasure.

551
00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:00.965
And how pretty you look
in that lovely mink coat.

552
00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:02.834
I've got three others at home.

553
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:07.227
And Mr. Salt, overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there for a minute?

554
00:46:07.488 --> 00:46:08.488
Augustus Gloop.

555
00:46:08.662 --> 00:46:10.663
Augustus, my dear boy,

556
00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:13.446
how good to see you,
and in such fine shape.

557
00:46:13.663 --> 00:46:17.196
And this must be the radiant Mrs.
Gloop. Just over there, dear lady.

558
00:46:17.242 --> 00:46:20.881
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child, welcome to Wonka's.

559
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.535
What kind of gum you got here?

560
00:46:22.753 --> 00:46:24.014
Charming, charming!

561
00:46:24.492 --> 00:46:25.840
Sam Beauregarde here, Mr. Wonka.

562
00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:27.537
My dear sir, what a genuine pleasure.

563
00:46:27.754 --> 00:46:31.166
If ever you need anything in the automotive line,
just call on Sam B, phone number's on the card.

564
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.277
With Sam B, it's a guarantee.

565
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.887
- I'm Mike Teevee.
- Mike.

566
00:46:36.104 --> 00:46:37.582
Wham! You're dead!

567
00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:39.061
Wonderful to meet you, Mike.

568
00:46:39.279 --> 00:46:41.062
And Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

569
00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:43.932
- What an adorable little boy you have.
- Thank you.

570
00:46:44.628 --> 00:46:45.411
Charlie Bucket.

571
00:46:45.628 --> 00:46:50.069
Well, well, Charlie Bucket, I read all about you in the
papers. I'm so happy for you. And who is this gentleman?

572
00:46:50.282 --> 00:46:51.848
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

573
00:46:52.021 --> 00:46:53.102
Delighted to meet you, sir.

574
00:46:53.196 --> 00:46:55.326
Overjoyed, enraptured, entranced.

575
00:46:55.544 --> 00:46:57.023
Are we ready? Yes! Good!

576
00:46:57.371 --> 00:46:58.719
In we go!

577
00:47:33.254 --> 00:47:36.425
Now. Hats, coats, galoshes, over here.

578
00:47:36.599 --> 00:47:39.642
But hurry please, we have so
much time and so little to see.

579
00:47:39.816 --> 00:47:41.774
Wait a minute! Strike that.

580
00:47:41.991 --> 00:47:44.340
Reverse it. Thank you.

581
00:47:46.253 --> 00:47:49.559
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

582
00:47:49.775 --> 00:47:51.255
Boy, what weird looking coat hangers.

583
00:47:53.864 --> 00:47:58.256
Little surprises around every corner but
nothing dangerous. Don't be alarmed.

584
00:47:58.517 --> 00:48:01.126
And as soon as your outer
vestments are in hand,

585
00:48:01.344 --> 00:48:02.692
we'll begin.

586
00:48:03.344 --> 00:48:04.344
Now.

587
00:48:04.432 --> 00:48:07.389
Will the children kindly step up here?

588
00:48:18.435 --> 00:48:20.523
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

589
00:48:20.783 --> 00:48:23.306
I didn't know we had to
sign anything for this tour.

590
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.046
I can't see what it says in the bottom.

591
00:48:25.567 --> 00:48:27.481
Violet? You first.

592
00:48:27.611 --> 00:48:28.742
Sign here.

593
00:48:28.959 --> 00:48:29.960
Hold it!

594
00:48:30.134 --> 00:48:32.633
Lemme through here, you kids. Violet,
baby, don't you sign anything there.

595
00:48:32.657 --> 00:48:33.874
What's this all about?

596
00:48:34.092 --> 00:48:35.700
Standard form of contract.

597
00:48:35.918 --> 00:48:39.571
Don't talk to me about contracts, Wonka. I
use 'em myself. They're strictly for suckers.

598
00:48:39.789 --> 00:48:43.051
Yes, but you wouldn't begrudge
me a little protection. A drop.

599
00:48:43.267 --> 00:48:44.810
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.

600
00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:47.574
- My Veruca don't sign anything either.
- Then she don't go in.

601
00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:49.400
I'm sorry, rules of the house.

602
00:48:49.618 --> 00:48:53.575
- I want to go in. Don't you dare stop me.
- I'm only trying to help you, sweetheart.

603
00:48:53.793 --> 00:48:58.142
Gimme that pen. You're
always making things difficult.

604
00:48:59.011 --> 00:49:02.621
Nicely handled, Veruca. She's a
girl who knows where she's going.

605
00:49:02.855 --> 00:49:03.753
Violet.

606
00:49:03.795 --> 00:49:05.720
Wait a minute, what's all that
small print there at the bottom?

607
00:49:05.744 --> 00:49:09.034
Oh, if you have any problems,
dial information, thank you for calling.

608
00:49:09.162 --> 00:49:11.021
- Mike, Augustus.
- Violet.

609
00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:12.318
Violet!

610
00:49:12.536 --> 00:49:15.016
I assume there's an accident
indemnity clause.

611
00:49:15.233 --> 00:49:16.233
Never between friends.

612
00:49:16.407 --> 00:49:19.972
Saw this in a movie once. Guy
signed his wife's insurance policy.

613
00:49:20.408 --> 00:49:22.191
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

614
00:49:22.365 --> 00:49:23.365
What about me, Grandpa?

615
00:49:23.496 --> 00:49:25.844
Sign away, Charlie.
We got nothing to lose.

616
00:49:26.061 --> 00:49:27.782
Let's go in. Come on!

617
00:49:27.806 --> 00:49:31.368
Patience, patience, little dear.
Everything has to be in order.

618
00:49:31.584 --> 00:49:33.411
Everyone's signed? Yes?

619
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.238
Good. On we go!

620
00:49:44.762 --> 00:49:46.328
Ninety-nine...

621
00:49:46.676 --> 00:49:47.850
forty-four...

622
00:49:48.154 --> 00:49:49.937
one hundred percent pure.

623
00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:53.765
Just through the other door please.

624
00:49:56.113 --> 00:49:57.940
Uh, Wonka, there's some mistake here...

625
00:49:58.592 --> 00:50:00.332
There is no other door.

626
00:50:00.593 --> 00:50:01.723
There's no way out!

627
00:50:01.941 --> 00:50:04.724
Well I know there's a door here some place.

628
00:50:04.942 --> 00:50:06.862
I don't like this, Wonka.
I don't like it at all!

629
00:50:07.029 --> 00:50:08.469
Is this a trick or something, Wonka?

630
00:50:08.508 --> 00:50:10.421
Help! Mr. Wonka, help!

631
00:50:10.595 --> 00:50:12.074
I'm getting squashed! Save me!

632
00:50:12.292 --> 00:50:14.640
Is it my soul that calls upon my name?

633
00:50:14.857 --> 00:50:16.293
Let me out or I'll scream!

634
00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:18.988
- Somebody's touching me.
- Now look here, Wonka...

635
00:50:19.206 --> 00:50:23.773
Excuse me, question time will come at the end
of the session. We must press on. Come along...

636
00:50:23.901 --> 00:50:24.901
Come along.

637
00:50:25.026 --> 00:50:27.106
- Ah, here we are.
- Oh, don't be a darn fool, Wonka.

638
00:50:27.252 --> 00:50:28.687
That's the way we came in.

639
00:50:28.992 --> 00:50:31.122
It is? Are you sure?

640
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:33.565
We've just come through there.

641
00:50:33.775 --> 00:50:35.211
Huh. How do you like that?

642
00:50:36.515 --> 00:50:38.386
- There we are...
- What is this, Wonka?

643
00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:39.602
Some kind of fun house?

644
00:50:40.342 --> 00:50:41.473
Why, having fun?

645
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.647
I've had enough. I'm not going in there.

646
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.585
Come on, Violet, we're getting out of here.

647
00:50:45.692 --> 00:50:49.127
Oh, you can't get out backwards.
You've gotta go forwards to go back.

648
00:50:49.344 --> 00:50:50.867
Better press on.

649
00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.303
- Hey, the room is getting smaller!
- No, it's not.

650
00:50:54.519 --> 00:50:56.737
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

651
00:50:57.216 --> 00:50:59.912
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

652
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.218
I doubt if any of us
will get out of here alive.

653
00:51:02.284 --> 00:51:05.098
Oh, you should never, never doubt
what nobody is sure about.

654
00:51:05.305 --> 00:51:07.479
You're not squeezing me
through that tiny door.

655
00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:10.297
You're off your bleeding nut, Wonka.
No one can get through there.

656
00:51:10.394 --> 00:51:11.742
My dear friends,

657
00:51:11.959 --> 00:51:14.829
you are now about to enter the nerve centre

658
00:51:15.047 --> 00:51:17.309
to the entire Wonka Factory.

659
00:51:18.221 --> 00:51:22.354
Inside this room, all of my
dreams become realities.

660
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.615
And some of my realities
become dreams.

661
00:51:24.788 --> 00:51:28.616
And almost everything you
will see is eatible. Edible.

662
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:30.790
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

663
00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:32.552
Let me in, I'm starving!

664
00:51:32.584 --> 00:51:35.834
Now, don't get overexcited!
Don't lose your head Augustus.

665
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.792
We wouldn't want anyone to lose that!

666
00:51:39.923 --> 00:51:41.053
Yet.

667
00:51:41.228 --> 00:51:43.054
Now, the combination...

668
00:51:43.229 --> 00:51:45.228
This is a musical lock.

669
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:48.969
Rachmaninoff.

670
00:51:49.187 --> 00:51:50.788
Ladies and gentlemen,

671
00:51:51.579 --> 00:51:53.274
boys and girls...

672
00:51:54.275 --> 00:51:55.970
The chocolate room.

673
00:52:34.112 --> 00:52:36.025
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.

674
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:38.199
Count to three.

675
00:53:52.784 --> 00:53:53.567
Hurry up, Violet.

676
00:53:53.784 --> 00:53:55.437
This way, Grandpa.

677
00:56:06.225 --> 00:56:08.472
What a disgusting, dirty river.

678
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:10.081
It's industrial waste, that.

679
00:56:10.255 --> 00:56:12.386
You've ruined your
watershed, Wonka. It's polluted.

680
00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:13.604
It's chocolate.

681
00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:15.083
That's chocolate?!?

682
00:56:15.257 --> 00:56:16.474
That's chocolate.

683
00:56:16.691 --> 00:56:18.126
A chocolate river.

684
00:56:18.344 --> 00:56:20.780
That's the most fantastic
thing I've ever seen.

685
00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.606
Ten thousand gallons an hour.

686
00:56:22.867 --> 00:56:26.607
And look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

687
00:56:27.694 --> 00:56:31.478
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

688
00:56:31.695 --> 00:56:35.435
You know, no other factory in the
world mixes its chocolate by waterfall.

689
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:39.089
But it's the only way if
you want it just right...

690
00:56:39.306 --> 00:56:41.698
Grandpa, look over there across the river!

691
00:56:42.046 --> 00:56:43.046
They're little men!

692
00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.133
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

693
00:56:45.482 --> 00:56:47.309
Now we know who makes the chocolate.

694
00:56:47.525 --> 00:56:50.700
I never saw anybody with
an orange face before.

695
00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:53.483
Funny-looking people, aren't they, Wonka?

696
00:56:53.657 --> 00:56:55.195
What are they doing there?

697
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:57.091
It must be creaming and sugaring time.

698
00:56:57.137 --> 00:57:00.225
- Well they can't be real people.
- Well of course they're real people.

699
00:57:00.485 --> 00:57:01.617
Stuff and nonsense.

700
00:57:01.791 --> 00:57:03.747
No, Oompa Loompas.

701
00:57:05.052 --> 00:57:05.878
From Loompaland.

702
00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:07.879
Loompaland? There's no such place.

703
00:57:08.044 --> 00:57:09.016
Excuse me, dear lady...

704
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.010
Mr. Wonka, I am a teacher of geography.

705
00:57:11.226 --> 00:57:12.662
Oh, well then you know all about it

706
00:57:12.704 --> 00:57:14.359
and what a terrible country it is.

707
00:57:14.576 --> 00:57:17.708
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

708
00:57:17.925 --> 00:57:20.969
And the poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless,

709
00:57:21.143 --> 00:57:23.159
they would get gobbled up right and left.

710
00:57:23.214 --> 00:57:26.746
A Wangdoodle would eat ten of them
for breakfast and think nothing of it.

711
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:28.928
And so, I said:

712
00:57:29.276 --> 00:57:32.060
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety,"

713
00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:35.191
"away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers"

714
00:57:35.364 --> 00:57:38.887
"and Snozzwangers and
rotten Vermicious Knids."

715
00:57:39.104 --> 00:57:43.062
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

716
00:57:43.279 --> 00:57:45.737
I'm sorry, but all questions
must be submitted in writing.

717
00:57:45.761 --> 00:57:47.823
And so, in the greatest of secrecy,

718
00:57:47.886 --> 00:57:51.717
I transported the entire population of
Oompa Loompas to my factory here.

719
00:57:51.934 --> 00:57:55.848
Hey, Daddy, I want an Oompa Loompa. I want
you to get me an Oompa Loompa right away.

720
00:57:56.022 --> 00:57:58.743
All right, Veruca, all right. I'll get
you one before the day is out.

721
00:57:59.023 --> 00:58:01.415
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

722
00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.937
Can it, you nit!

723
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.416
Mmmmm... this stuff is terrific.

724
00:58:05.676 --> 00:58:08.982
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

725
00:58:09.373 --> 00:58:12.983
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

726
00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:17.202
Oh, uh, Augustus, please, don't do that. My
chocolate must never be touched by human hands.

727
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:20.874
Please don't do that! Don't do that.
You're contaminating my entire river.

728
00:58:20.898 --> 00:58:23.073
Please, I beg you, Augustus!

729
00:58:24.464 --> 00:58:25.595
My chocolate!

730
00:58:25.812 --> 00:58:26.900
Help!

731
00:58:28.074 --> 00:58:30.336
My chocolate! My beautiful chocolate.

732
00:58:31.814 --> 00:58:34.118
Don't just stand there. Do something!

733
00:58:34.336 --> 00:58:36.424
Help. Police. Murder.

734
00:58:36.719 --> 00:58:39.425
- Quick, Charlie. Here.
- Quick, Augustus, grab this!

735
00:58:40.381 --> 00:58:41.991
What-what's happening to him?

736
00:58:42.056 --> 00:58:43.853
- It looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!

737
00:58:43.904 --> 00:58:45.295
- Save him!
- Oh, it's too late.

738
00:58:45.513 --> 00:58:46.905
- Too late?
- Oh, he's had it now,

739
00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:49.602
- the suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back.

740
00:58:50.079 --> 00:58:51.211
Where is he?

741
00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.515
Watch the pipe.

742
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.255
How long is he going to stay down, Daddy?

743
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:57.864
- He can't swim.
- There's no better time to learn.

744
00:58:58.429 --> 00:59:00.039
There's his coat going up the pipe.

745
00:59:00.256 --> 00:59:01.300
Call a plumber.

746
00:59:01.518 --> 00:59:03.475
He's stuck in the pipe
there, isn't he, Wonka?

747
00:59:03.692 --> 00:59:05.053
It's his stomach that's done that.

748
00:59:06.171 --> 00:59:08.606
- He's blocking all the chocolate.
- Well, what happens now?

749
00:59:09.171 --> 00:59:13.434
Oh, the pressure'll get him out. Terrific
pressure is building up behind the blockage.

750
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:16.652
I wonder how long it's gonna
take him to push through.

751
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:18.913
The suspense is terrible.

752
00:59:19.131 --> 00:59:20.131
I hope it'll last.

753
00:59:23.219 --> 00:59:24.578
He'll never get out!

754
00:59:24.633 --> 00:59:26.380
Yes, he will, Charlie. Watch.

755
00:59:26.524 --> 00:59:29.742
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

756
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.367
He's gone! He'll be made into
marshmallows in five seconds!

757
00:59:33.482 --> 00:59:36.396
- Impossible, my dear lady, that's absurd! Unthinkable!
- Why?

758
00:59:37.136 --> 00:59:39.678
Because that pipe doesn't go to the
marshmallow room. It goes to the fudge room.

759
00:59:39.702 --> 00:59:41.050
You terrible man.

760
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:46.442
Take Mrs. Gloop straight to the
fudge room, but look sharp!

761
00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.941
Or her little boy is liable to
get poured into the boiler.

762
00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.791
You've boiled him up, I know it!

763
00:59:50.965 --> 00:59:54.619
Nil desperandum, dear lady.
Across the desert lies the promised land.

764
00:59:54.836 --> 00:59:56.184
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

765
00:59:56.402 --> 01:00:00.924
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.

766
01:00:54.546 --> 01:00:57.112
Hey, what kind of place you
running here anyhow, Wonka?

767
01:00:57.483 --> 01:01:01.576
Madames et monsieurs, maintenant nous
allons faire un petit voyage par bateau.

768
01:01:01.636 --> 01:01:02.596
What's he talking about?

769
01:01:02.628 --> 01:01:06.409
Voulez-vous entrer le Wonkatania?

770
01:01:21.902 --> 01:01:23.207
Wow, what a boat!

771
01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.425
Ohhhh, looks good enough to eat.

772
01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:28.228
That's quite a nice little canoe
you've got there, Wonka.

773
01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:32.297
All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by.

774
01:01:32.513 --> 01:01:33.557
All aboard, everybody.

775
01:01:33.731 --> 01:01:35.775
Uh, ladies first, and that means Veruca.

776
01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:38.950
If she's a lady, I'm a Vermicious Knid.

777
01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:42.734
- You sure this thing'll float, eh, Wonka?
- With your buoyancy, sir, rest assured.

778
01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.126
She's very pretty, but is she seaworthy?

779
01:01:45.343 --> 01:01:48.909
Nothing to worry about, my dear lady.
I take good care of my guests.

780
01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.554
Yeah, you took real good care of that
August kid over there, that's for sure.

781
01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:53.064
Everybody aboard?

782
01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:56.303
You're going to love this.

783
01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.868
Just love it.

784
01:02:28.397 --> 01:02:32.356
Hey, Daddy, I want a boat like this. A
beautiful paddle boat, that's what I want.

785
01:02:32.572 --> 01:02:35.139
What she wants is a good kick in the pants.

786
01:02:35.487 --> 01:02:36.791
I think I'm gonna be seasick.

787
01:02:36.965 --> 01:02:38.605
- Here, try one of these.
- What are they?

788
01:02:38.661 --> 01:02:41.300
Rainbow drops. Suck 'em and you
can spit in seven different colours.

789
01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:42.967
Spitting's a dirty habit.

790
01:02:43.141 --> 01:02:44.750
I know a worse one.

791
01:02:56.492 --> 01:02:59.319
- What business you in, Salt?
- Nuts.

792
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:12.791
Hang on, where are we going?

793
01:03:13.018 --> 01:03:14.995
I don't know, but I don't like the
looks of that tunnel up there.

794
01:03:15.019 --> 01:03:16.323
Hey, Wonka, I want off!

795
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:21.456
Round the world and home again,
that's the sailor's way!

796
01:03:22.107 --> 01:03:24.457
I don't like this ride, Daddy.

797
01:03:28.457 --> 01:03:30.241
We're going too fast!

798
01:03:30.457 --> 01:03:31.893
We're gonna sink, I know it!

799
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.241
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?
- Faster!

800
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.699
Hang on, darling! Just close
your eyes and hang on tight!

801
01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:43.647
- What is this, a freak-out?
- Hey, this isn't funny, Wonka!

802
01:03:44.114 --> 01:03:46.244
You can't possibly see
where you're going, Wonka!

803
01:03:46.462 --> 01:03:48.375
You're right. I can't.

804
01:03:48.636 --> 01:03:50.550
Boy, what a great series this would make.

805
01:03:52.464 --> 01:03:56.899
- This is kind of strange...
- Yeah, strange, Charlie, but it's fun! Ha ha!

806
01:03:58.987 --> 01:04:00.814
How much to get off the boat, Wonka?

807
01:04:03.075 --> 01:04:04.115
I think I'm gonna be sick.

808
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.878
I can take a joke, but
this has gone too far.

809
01:04:05.902 --> 01:04:08.555
Tell that little guy to
turn us around, Wonka!

810
01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:10.555
Now I am gonna be sick!

811
01:04:22.452 --> 01:04:26.429
He's singing.

812
01:04:45.521 --> 01:04:49.261
Not a speck of light is showing,
so the danger must be growing.

813
01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:52.349
Are the fires of hell a-glowing?

814
01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:55.828
Is the grisly reaper mowing?

815
01:04:56.045 --> 01:04:57.351
Yes!

816
01:04:57.524 --> 01:05:02.177
The danger must be growing,
for the rowers keep on rowing.

817
01:05:02.395 --> 01:05:05.396
And they're certainly not showing

818
01:05:05.657 --> 01:05:09.571
any signs that they are slowing!

819
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:15.963
Oh, make him stop, Daddy!

820
01:05:16.018 --> 01:05:18.779
- Wonka, this has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir!

821
01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:20.095
Stop the boat!

822
01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:23.531
- We're there.
- Where?

823
01:05:23.749 --> 01:05:24.749
Here.

824
01:05:24.835 --> 01:05:28.489
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.

825
01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:30.316
All ashore!

826
01:05:30.489 --> 01:05:32.490
Let me off this crate!

827
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:35.707
- Now why don't they show stuff like that on TV?
- I don't know.

828
01:05:35.926 --> 01:05:36.969
What a nightmare.

829
01:05:37.143 --> 01:05:39.796
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

830
01:05:40.014 --> 01:05:41.014
Dairy cream.

831
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.100
Whipped cream.

832
01:05:42.144 --> 01:05:44.015
- Coffee cream.
- Vanilla cream.

833
01:05:44.927 --> 01:05:46.364
Hair cream?

834
01:05:46.397 --> 01:05:49.826
Meine Herrschaften, schenken
Sie mir ihre Aufmerksamkeit.

835
01:05:49.885 --> 01:05:51.103
That's not French.

836
01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:54.310
Sie kommen jetzt in den interessantesten

837
01:05:54.342 --> 01:05:57.756
und gleichzeitig geheimsten
raum meiner fabrik.

838
01:05:57.844 --> 01:05:59.367
I can't take much more of this.

839
01:05:59.443 --> 01:06:01.334
Meine Dammen und Herren,

840
01:06:02.019 --> 01:06:04.411
Der Inventing Room.

841
01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:07.586
Now remember, no messing about.

842
01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.500
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

843
01:06:10.674 --> 01:06:11.674
No telling what?

844
01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:16.023
You see, all of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

845
01:06:16.349 --> 01:06:20.045
Old Slugworth would give his false
teeth to get inside for just five minutes,

846
01:06:20.098 --> 01:06:22.838
so don't touch a thing!

847
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:49.336
Inventing room?

848
01:06:49.511 --> 01:06:51.380
It looks more like a Turkish bath to me.

849
01:06:51.598 --> 01:06:54.629
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

850
01:06:54.653 --> 01:06:57.729
- You got a garbage strike going on here, Wonka?
- Who does your cleaning up?

851
01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.488
Shouldn't you be wearing rubber gloves?

852
01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:01.837
You'll have the health inspectors
after you, you know that, don't you?

853
01:07:01.861 --> 01:07:05.644
Invention, my dear friends,
is ninety-three percent perspiration,

854
01:07:05.862 --> 01:07:07.906
six percent electricity,

855
01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:09.907
four percent evaporation,

856
01:07:10.124 --> 01:07:12.429
and two percent butterscotch ripple.

857
01:07:12.646 --> 01:07:14.821
That's a hundred and five percent!

858
01:07:15.038 --> 01:07:16.300
Any good?

859
01:07:17.778 --> 01:07:18.822
Yes!

860
01:07:19.213 --> 01:07:20.649
Excuse me...

861
01:07:23.041 --> 01:07:26.477
Time is a precious thing. Never waste it.

862
01:07:28.302 --> 01:07:32.086
- He's absolutely bonkers.
- And that's not bad.

863
01:07:48.308 --> 01:07:50.395
I told you not to, silly boy.

864
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:51.874
Your teeth!

865
01:07:52.092 --> 01:07:53.657
Boy, that's great stuff.

866
01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:57.571
That's exploding candy for your enemies.
Great idea, isn't it?

867
01:07:57.745 --> 01:08:00.354
Not ready yet, though, still too weak.
Needs more gelignite.

868
01:08:10.531 --> 01:08:11.837
What's that for?

869
01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:13.532
Gives it a little kick.

870
01:08:16.185 --> 01:08:17.359
Wonka?

871
01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.621
Butterscotch... butter gin...

872
01:08:21.882 --> 01:08:23.665
you've got something going on
inside of here?

873
01:08:23.883 --> 01:08:26.796
Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.

874
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.842
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

875
01:08:33.059 --> 01:08:35.103
Too cold. Far too cold.

876
01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:37.626
That's gourmet cooking for you.

877
01:08:38.452 --> 01:08:40.495
No! Don't. Please.

878
01:08:40.844 --> 01:08:43.427
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

879
01:08:43.473 --> 01:08:46.758
This is the most secret machine
in my entire factory.

880
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:50.586
- This is the one that's really going to sizzle old Slugworth.
- What's it do?

881
01:08:52.238 --> 01:08:54.412
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah.

882
01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.028
But what's it do?

883
01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:21.649
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

884
01:09:21.688 --> 01:09:24.116
Did you say "Everlasting Gobstoppers"?

885
01:09:24.333 --> 01:09:27.613
That's right. For children with very little
pocket money. You can suck 'em forever.

886
01:09:27.682 --> 01:09:29.465
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper.

887
01:09:29.682 --> 01:09:30.682
- Me too!
- And me!

888
01:09:30.857 --> 01:09:33.380
Fantastic invention.
Revolutionize the industry.

889
01:09:33.596 --> 01:09:37.250
You can suck 'em and suck 'em and suck 'em,
and they'll never get any smaller. Never.

890
01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:38.664
At least I don't think they do.

891
01:09:38.772 --> 01:09:40.816
- A few more tests.
- How do you make 'em?

892
01:09:41.579 --> 01:09:44.556
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak a little louder next time.

893
01:09:44.773 --> 01:09:48.209
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! I do!

894
01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:53.602
I can only give them to you if you solemnly
swear to keep them for yourselves

895
01:09:53.776 --> 01:09:57.777
and never show them to another living
soul as long as you all shall live.

896
01:09:58.386 --> 01:09:59.081
Agreed?

897
01:09:59.299 --> 01:10:00.299
Agreed.

898
01:10:00.473 --> 01:10:03.909
Good. One for you, and one
for you, and one for you.

899
01:10:04.127 --> 01:10:05.474
Eh, what about Charlie?

900
01:10:05.822 --> 01:10:07.084
And one for Charlie.

901
01:10:07.301 --> 01:10:09.693
Hey, she's got two. I want another one!

902
01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:12.694
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has had one,

903
01:10:12.912 --> 01:10:16.390
and one is enough for anybody.
Now come along.

904
01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:19.522
Now over here, if you'll follow me,

905
01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:21.957
I have something rather
special to show you.

906
01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:23.654
Well, it's special, all right.

907
01:10:24.175 --> 01:10:26.350
I only hope my Veruca doesn't want one.

908
01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:27.697
What a contraption.

909
01:10:27.915 --> 01:10:28.959
Isn't she scrumptious?

910
01:10:28.993 --> 01:10:31.960
She's my revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

911
01:10:32.165 --> 01:10:35.482
Now. Button, button, who's
got the button?

912
01:10:35.917 --> 01:10:37.439
It's over there.

913
01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:39.179
- Here?
- Yeah.

914
01:10:55.269 --> 01:10:57.168
What you are witnessing, dear friends,

915
01:10:57.216 --> 01:11:00.403
is the most enormous
miracle of the machine age:

916
01:11:00.513 --> 01:11:03.707
The creation of a confectionery giant!

917
01:11:13.362 --> 01:11:14.798
- Finito!
- That's all?

918
01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:17.450
That's all!? Don't you know what this is?

919
01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:19.407
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

920
01:11:19.624 --> 01:11:23.225
It's the most amazing, fabulous,
sensational gum in the whole world.

921
01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:24.669
What's so fab about it?

922
01:11:24.887 --> 01:11:28.018
- This little piece of gum is a three course dinner.
- Bull.

923
01:11:28.235 --> 01:11:31.120
- No, roast beef, but I haven't got it quite right yet.
- I don't care.

924
01:11:31.167 --> 01:11:33.498
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

925
01:11:33.715 --> 01:11:35.455
So long as it's gum, then that's for me.

926
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:37.673
Violet, now don't you do anything stupid.

927
01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:39.717
What's it taste like?

928
01:11:40.065 --> 01:11:42.631
Madness! It's tomato soup!

929
01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:45.806
It's hot and creamy I can actually feel it
running down my throat!

930
01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.675
- It's delicious!
- Stop, don't...

931
01:11:47.893 --> 01:11:49.458
Why doesn't she listen to Mr. Wonka?

932
01:11:49.676 --> 01:11:51.840
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

933
01:11:51.894 --> 01:11:53.721
This sure is great soup.

934
01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:55.721
Hey, second course is coming up!

935
01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.243
Roast beef and a baked potato! Mmmm.

936
01:11:58.766 --> 01:12:00.505
With sour cream?

937
01:12:01.504 --> 01:12:04.810
- What's for dessert, baby?
- Dessert? Here it comes.

938
01:12:05.028 --> 01:12:09.073
Blueberry pie and cream! It's the most
marvellous blueberry pie that I've ever tasted!

939
01:12:09.247 --> 01:12:11.725
- Holy Toledo, what's happening to your face?
- Cool it, Dad!

940
01:12:11.942 --> 01:12:12.986
Lemme finish.

941
01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.813
Yeah, but your face is turning blue!

942
01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:18.162
- Violet, you're turning violet, Violet!
- What are you talking about?

943
01:12:18.336 --> 01:12:20.554
I told you I hadn't got it quite right yet.

944
01:12:20.771 --> 01:12:23.163
You can say that again.
Look what it's done to my kid!

945
01:12:23.337 --> 01:12:26.686
It always goes wrong when we
come to the dessert. Always.

946
01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:29.078
Violet, what are you doing now?!?

947
01:12:29.295 --> 01:12:31.252
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny.

948
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:33.514
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?

949
01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:35.838
- You're blowing up like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

950
01:12:35.862 --> 01:12:38.100
- Somebody do something! Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

951
01:12:38.124 --> 01:12:40.516
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

952
01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.927
- They all become blueberries.
- You've really done it this time, haven't you, Wonka?

953
01:12:43.951 --> 01:12:45.516
I'll break you for this.

954
01:12:45.734 --> 01:12:46.974
Oh, well, I'll get it right in the end.

955
01:12:46.998 --> 01:12:48.690
Help! Help!

956
01:12:48.866 --> 01:12:51.344
We've got to let the air out of her, quick!

957
01:12:51.605 --> 01:12:52.780
There's no air in there.

958
01:12:52.953 --> 01:12:54.519
- That's juice.
- Juice?!

959
01:12:54.736 --> 01:12:57.867
Would you roll the young lady down
to the juicing room at once, please?

960
01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.086
- What for?
- For squeezing.

961
01:13:00.303 --> 01:13:02.695
She has to be squeezed immediately
before she explodes.

962
01:13:02.913 --> 01:13:05.261
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

963
01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:03.102
I'll get even with you for this,
Wonka, if it's the last thing I ever do!

964
01:14:03.276 --> 01:14:05.885
I got a blueberry for a daughter...

965
01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:10.626
Where is fancy bred?
In the heart, or in the head?

966
01:14:12.105 --> 01:14:13.626
Shall we roll on?

967
01:14:17.889 --> 01:14:19.237
Thank you.

968
01:14:20.063 --> 01:14:24.500
Well, well, well... two naughty,
nasty little children gone.

969
01:14:25.065 --> 01:14:28.501
Three good, sweet little children left.

970
01:14:30.588 --> 01:14:33.415
Hurry, please, long way to go yet.

971
01:14:36.893 --> 01:14:39.025
Wait a minute. Must show you this.

972
01:14:39.243 --> 01:14:41.851
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

973
01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:46.635
Lick an orange, it tastes like an orange. Lick a
pineapple, it tastes like a pineapple. Go ahead, try it.

974
01:14:48.288 --> 01:14:50.245
Mmm, I got a plum.

975
01:14:50.462 --> 01:14:53.898
Grandpa, this banana's
fantastic! It tastes so real.

976
01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:57.203
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

977
01:14:57.421 --> 01:14:59.813
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries!

978
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:03.205
Snozzberries? Who ever
heard of a snozzberry?

979
01:15:04.205 --> 01:15:06.641
We are the music-makers,

980
01:15:06.989 --> 01:15:10.293
and we are the dreamers of dreams.

981
01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:12.903
Come along, come along.

982
01:15:15.904 --> 01:15:18.731
Something very unusual in here.

983
01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:22.384
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink...

984
01:15:22.558 --> 01:15:23.385
Yet.

985
01:15:23.559 --> 01:15:25.080
What's it making, Mr. Wonka?

986
01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:29.379
Fizzy Lifting Drinks. They fill you with
gas, and the gas is so terrifically lifting

987
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:31.816
that it lifts you right off the
ground like a balloon.

988
01:15:31.863 --> 01:15:34.387
Oh, isn't it high! Gosh!

989
01:15:34.519 --> 01:15:36.519
But I daren't sell it yet.
It's still too powerful.

990
01:15:36.582 --> 01:15:38.013
Come on, let us try some! Please?

991
01:15:38.606 --> 01:15:42.954
No, no, no. Absolutely not. There'd be
children floating around all over the place.

992
01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:45.085
Come along now. Don't hang about.

993
01:15:45.782 --> 01:15:48.173
You're going to be wild
about this next room.

994
01:15:49.435 --> 01:15:51.827
Let's take a drink,
Charlie. Nobody's watching.

995
01:15:52.045 --> 01:15:53.784
A small one won't hurt us.

996
01:15:59.219 --> 01:16:00.611
Mmmm, not bad.

997
01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.047
Well?

998
01:16:04.308 --> 01:16:05.874
Nothing's happening.

999
01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:09.352
You're right, Charlie. I
can't understand why...

1000
01:16:11.788 --> 01:16:13.441
Oh, oh, oh, I feel terribly strange...

1001
01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:16.495
- What do we do now, Grandpa?
- I don't know, Charlie, but aaaah! Oh! Oh!

1002
01:16:17.225 --> 01:16:21.443
- We're in big trouble! Mr. Wonka isn't gonna like this.
- We can't stay up here all day!

1003
01:16:21.617 --> 01:16:23.638
- You're right, Charlie, but...
- I'm gonna try and get down.

1004
01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:26.661
All right, Charlie, but please...
be very careful.

1005
01:16:27.662 --> 01:16:31.507
Hey, it's fun, Grandpa! It works!
Come on in, the air's fine!

1006
01:16:31.547 --> 01:16:32.500
Oh, I don't know, Charlie.

1007
01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:34.857
- I haven't been swimming in twenty years, I...
- Come on, give me your hand.

1008
01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.838
I don't think I ought to...

1009
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:41.405
Oh. Oh! This is great!

1010
01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.231
Hey, try this, Grandpa! Whee!

1011
01:16:43.579 --> 01:16:45.841
All right, Charlie, wait for me! Wheeeeee!

1012
01:16:49.668 --> 01:16:52.538
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

1013
01:16:54.017 --> 01:16:55.886
Grandpa, this is really great.

1014
01:16:56.104 --> 01:16:58.148
Look, I'm a bird!

1015
01:17:00.193 --> 01:17:02.323
I feel light as a feather.

1016
01:17:03.193 --> 01:17:04.368
Look down, Charlie.

1017
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:06.412
We're really high now.

1018
01:17:10.587 --> 01:17:12.282
Watch this, Grandpa.

1019
01:17:15.849 --> 01:17:17.370
Wonderful, Charlie.

1020
01:17:17.545 --> 01:17:19.720
- Try it, Grandpa.
- Oh, I don't know, I...

1021
01:17:19.937 --> 01:17:21.415
Come on, Grandpa.

1022
01:17:21.633 --> 01:17:23.112
All right.

1023
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:27.635
Hey, you did it, Grandpa.

1024
01:17:29.026 --> 01:17:30.853
I think I hit an air pocket.

1025
01:17:31.027 --> 01:17:33.071
You can fly to the moon this way.

1026
01:17:33.288 --> 01:17:35.246
Let's just fly south for the winter.

1027
01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:36.897
Why not?

1028
01:17:38.724 --> 01:17:39.812
I'm a bird!

1029
01:17:40.029 --> 01:17:41.334
I'm a plane!

1030
01:17:41.551 --> 01:17:42.552
I'm...

1031
01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:44.639
going too high!

1032
01:17:45.465 --> 01:17:47.727
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

1033
01:17:47.988 --> 01:17:48.988
Help!

1034
01:17:49.162 --> 01:17:50.771
Grandpa, the fan!

1035
01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:53.032
Stay away from it, Charlie.
It'll chop us to bits!

1036
01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:55.468
We're in trouble, Charlie. I can't stop!

1037
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:57.033
It's pulling me in!

1038
01:17:57.251 --> 01:17:59.121
I can't stop! I can't stop!

1039
01:17:59.338 --> 01:18:01.687
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something, quick!

1040
01:18:02.339 --> 01:18:04.905
There's nothing to grab on to! Help!

1041
01:18:05.427 --> 01:18:06.689
We're gonna get killed!

1042
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:08.688
Help! Help!

1043
01:18:08.906 --> 01:18:11.689
Mr. Wonka, please! Turn off the fan!

1044
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:16.378
I'm going down!

1045
01:18:16.432 --> 01:18:20.039
Quick, Charlie, burp, burp! If you don't
get down you'll be chopped into ribbons!

1046
01:18:20.257 --> 01:18:22.388
- I can't! Help!
- You've gotta burp, Charlie.

1047
01:18:22.605 --> 01:18:24.475
It's the only way.

1048
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.041
'Atta boy, burp again.

1049
01:18:27.259 --> 01:18:29.129
'Atta boy, come on.

1050
01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:33.564
Ahhhh, that's wonderful, Charlie.

1051
01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:43.103
Grab onto me, Charlie.
We're gonna be all right now.

1052
01:18:51.308 --> 01:18:52.526
Good boy.

1053
01:18:53.135 --> 01:18:55.440
From now on, we keep
our feet on the ground.

1054
01:18:55.657 --> 01:18:57.745
Come on, let's catch up to the others!

1055
01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:02.094
I know what you're thinking.

1056
01:19:02.312 --> 01:19:04.312
They can't be doing what they're doing.

1057
01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:06.573
But they are. They have to.

1058
01:19:06.791 --> 01:19:08.922
I haven't met the Oompa Loompa
yet who could do it.

1059
01:19:09.488 --> 01:19:11.662
These are the geese
that lay the golden eggs.

1060
01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.683
As you can see, they're larger than
ordinary geese. As a matter of fact,

1061
01:19:14.707 --> 01:19:16.292
they're quadruple size geese,

1062
01:19:16.378 --> 01:19:20.186
which produce octuple size eggs They're
laying overtime right now for Easter.

1063
01:19:20.269 --> 01:19:21.751
But Easter's over!

1064
01:19:22.578 --> 01:19:23.969
They don't know that.

1065
01:19:24.143 --> 01:19:26.448
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

1066
01:19:28.057 --> 01:19:30.057
What happens if they drop
one of those eggs, Wonka?

1067
01:19:30.493 --> 01:19:33.058
An omelet fit for a king, sir.

1068
01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.015
Are they chocolate eggs?

1069
01:19:35.233 --> 01:19:38.060
Golden chocolate eggs.
That's a great delicacy.

1070
01:19:38.234 --> 01:19:39.713
But I wouldn't get too close.

1071
01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:42.890
The geese are very temperamental.
That's why we have the Eggdicator.

1072
01:19:42.977 --> 01:19:43.774
Eggdawhat?

1073
01:19:43.844 --> 01:19:47.019
The Eggdicator. The Eggdicator can
tell the difference between a good egg

1074
01:19:47.672 --> 01:19:48.889
and a bad egg.

1075
01:19:49.107 --> 01:19:52.498
If it's a good egg, it's shined up
and shipped out all over the world.

1076
01:19:52.847 --> 01:19:54.760
But if it's a bad egg...

1077
01:19:55.673 --> 01:19:57.196
down the chute.

1078
01:20:01.457 --> 01:20:03.066
It's an educated Eggdicator.

1079
01:20:03.284 --> 01:20:04.849
It's a lot of nonsense.

1080
01:20:12.722 --> 01:20:14.417
Hey, Daddy, I want a golden goose.

1081
01:20:14.635 --> 01:20:15.722
Here we go again.

1082
01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.592
All right, sweetheart, all right.

1083
01:20:17.809 --> 01:20:19.984
Daddy'll get you a golden goose
as soon as we get home.

1084
01:20:20.201 --> 01:20:22.550
No, I want one of those!

1085
01:20:23.202 --> 01:20:25.420
Wonka, how much do you
want for the golden goose?

1086
01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:27.179
- They're not for sale.
- Name your price.

1087
01:20:27.203 --> 01:20:28.247
She can't have one.

1088
01:20:28.465 --> 01:20:29.769
Who says I can't?

1089
01:20:29.987 --> 01:20:31.682
- The man with the funny hat.
- I want one!

1090
01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:33.944
I want a golden goose!

1091
01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.162
Gooses.

1092
01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.597
Geeses.

1093
01:20:36.815 --> 01:20:39.423
I want my geese to
lay gold eggs for Easter.

1094
01:20:39.641 --> 01:20:41.859
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least a hundred a day.

1095
01:20:42.077 --> 01:20:45.078
- Anything you say.
- And by the way...

1096
01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:46.513
I want a feast.

1097
01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:48.426
You ate before you came to the factory.

1098
01:20:50.644 --> 01:20:51.644
Huh, one of those.

1099
01:20:54.733 --> 01:20:57.974
You can have all those
things when you get home.

1100
01:20:58.168 --> 01:21:01.430
No, now!
I want a ball.

1101
01:21:10.519 --> 01:21:11.519
Now!

1102
01:22:28.192 --> 01:22:29.931
She was a bad egg.

1103
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.585
Where's she gone?

1104
01:22:32.845 --> 01:22:36.020
Where all the other bad eggs go:
Down the garbage chute.

1105
01:22:36.281 --> 01:22:38.281
The garbage chute.

1106
01:22:38.847 --> 01:22:40.238
Where does it lead to?

1107
01:22:40.412 --> 01:22:42.021
To the furnace.

1108
01:22:42.369 --> 01:22:44.196
The furnace.

1109
01:22:45.022 --> 01:22:47.806
- She'll be sizzled like a sausage.
- Well not necessarily.

1110
01:22:48.023 --> 01:22:50.371
- She could be stuck just inside the tube.
- Inside the...

1111
01:22:50.937 --> 01:22:51.719
Hold on!

1112
01:22:51.937 --> 01:22:53.502
Veruca, sweetheart.

1113
01:22:53.676 --> 01:22:55.547
Daddy's coming!

1114
01:22:58.026 --> 01:23:00.157
There's gonna be a lot of garbage today.

1115
01:23:00.374 --> 01:23:03.244
Well, Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.

1116
01:23:03.462 --> 01:23:05.985
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.

1117
01:23:06.201 --> 01:23:10.290
Mr. Wonka, they won't really be
burned in the furnace, will they?

1118
01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:13.900
Well, I think that furnace
is lit only every other day,

1119
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.639
so they have a good sporting
chance, haven't they?

1120
01:24:08.957 --> 01:24:11.741
I don't understand it. The children
are disappearing like rabbits.

1121
01:24:11.958 --> 01:24:15.089
Well, we still have each other.
Shall we press on?

1122
01:24:15.263 --> 01:24:17.264
Mr. Wonka, can't we sit down for a minute?

1123
01:24:17.438 --> 01:24:21.613
- The pace is killing me.
- My dear lady, transportation has already been arranged.

1124
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:28.397
Behold the Wonkamobile.

1125
01:24:28.615 --> 01:24:30.615
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.

1126
01:24:30.789 --> 01:24:33.616
Places, please, the
dance is about to begin.

1127
01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.070
Better grab a seat, they're going fast.

1128
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:39.139
Mr. Wonka, what's that
they're filling it up with?

1129
01:24:39.313 --> 01:24:42.096
Oh, ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles,

1130
01:24:42.314 --> 01:24:45.620
bubble-ade, bubble cola, double cola,
double bubble burp-a-cola,

1131
01:24:45.793 --> 01:24:48.794
and all the crazy carbonated
stuff that tickles your nose.

1132
01:24:48.968 --> 01:24:51.882
Few people realize what tremendous
power there is in one of those things.

1133
01:24:52.143 --> 01:24:54.012
Sorry I asked.

1134
01:24:54.274 --> 01:24:57.274
You think Slugworth would
pay extra to know about this?

1135
01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:00.449
Just keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut.

1136
01:25:01.928 --> 01:25:03.102
Everybody set?

1137
01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.624
Is this gonna go fast, Grandpa?

1138
01:25:04.842 --> 01:25:07.436
It should, Charlie. It's got more
gas in it than a politician.

1139
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:11.800
Now hold on tight. I'm gonna really open
her up this time and see what she can do.

1140
01:25:19.845 --> 01:25:21.846
Swifter than eagles...

1141
01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:24.195
stronger than lions...

1142
01:25:32.154 --> 01:25:34.023
It's getting in my eye!

1143
01:25:34.502 --> 01:25:36.329
Oh, it's even in my shoes!

1144
01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:39.198
I'm soaked! It'll never come out!

1145
01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:41.025
It's sticking to my gun.

1146
01:25:49.549 --> 01:25:52.985
My dress, my hair, my face!
Ohhhhhh...

1147
01:25:54.029 --> 01:25:56.899
I'm sending you the cleaning bill,
Mr. Wonka!

1148
01:25:59.987 --> 01:26:01.856
I'm dry cleaned!

1149
01:26:05.814 --> 01:26:06.945
Hey, Grandpa,

1150
01:26:07.119 --> 01:26:09.424
what was that we just went through?

1151
01:26:09.641 --> 01:26:11.042
Hsawaknow.

1152
01:26:11.074 --> 01:26:14.208
- Is that Japanese?
- No, that's "Wonkawash" spelled backwards.

1153
01:26:14.381 --> 01:26:16.513
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
The journey is over.

1154
01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:19.035
Finest bath I've had in twenty years.

1155
01:26:19.253 --> 01:26:20.601
Let's do it again, Mr. Wonka.

1156
01:26:20.818 --> 01:26:24.167
- You mean that's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

1157
01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:28.745
If the Good Lord had intended us to walk,
he wouldn't have invented roller skates.

1158
01:26:29.081 --> 01:26:30.864
Now would you all please put these on.

1159
01:26:31.081 --> 01:26:33.343
We have to be very careful.

1160
01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:36.170
There's dangerous stuff inside.

1161
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:39.952
Wonkavision,

1162
01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:42.689
my very latest and greatest invention.

1163
01:26:43.346 --> 01:26:45.738
- It's television.
- Uh, it's Wonkavision.

1164
01:26:45.912 --> 01:26:48.956
Now I suppose you all know
how ordinary television works.

1165
01:26:49.173 --> 01:26:51.479
Sure, I do. You photograph something,

1166
01:26:51.696 --> 01:26:54.306
and then the photograph is split
up into millions of tiny pieces,

1167
01:26:54.522 --> 01:26:59.003
and they go whizzing through the air down to your TV set
where they're all put together again in the right order.

1168
01:26:59.263 --> 01:27:02.351
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

1169
01:27:02.612 --> 01:27:04.775
So I said to myself,
"If they can do it with a photograph,"

1170
01:27:04.799 --> 01:27:07.526
"why can't I do it with
a bar of chocolate?"

1171
01:27:10.439 --> 01:27:14.832
I shall now send this chocolate bar from
one end of the room to the other.

1172
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:18.398
It has to be big because whenever
you transmit something by television,

1173
01:27:18.483 --> 01:27:20.351
it always ends up smaller
on the other end.

1174
01:27:21.139 --> 01:27:22.747
Goggles on, please.

1175
01:27:24.965 --> 01:27:27.053
Lights, camera,

1176
01:27:27.271 --> 01:27:28.445
action!

1177
01:27:30.228 --> 01:27:31.923
You can remove your goggles.

1178
01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:34.011
Where's the chocolate?

1179
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:36.447
It's flying over our
heads in a million pieces.

1180
01:27:39.317 --> 01:27:40.926
Now watch the screen.

1181
01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:45.101
Here it comes.

1182
01:27:46.406 --> 01:27:47.884
There it is.

1183
01:27:48.231 --> 01:27:49.004
Take it.

1184
01:27:49.050 --> 01:27:51.134
How can you take it? It's just a picture.

1185
01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.625
All right, you take it.

1186
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.060
It's real.

1187
01:27:55.148 --> 01:27:56.148
Taste it. It's delicious.

1188
01:27:56.234 --> 01:27:58.148
It's just gotten smaller, that's all.

1189
01:28:00.497 --> 01:28:01.453
It's perfect.

1190
01:28:01.514 --> 01:28:02.628
It's unbelievable.

1191
01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:03.540
It's a miracle.

1192
01:28:03.758 --> 01:28:04.758
It's a TV dinner.

1193
01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:05.628
It's Wonkavision.

1194
01:28:05.846 --> 01:28:07.281
It could change the world.

1195
01:28:07.498 --> 01:28:09.325
Mr. Wonka, can you send other things?

1196
01:28:09.498 --> 01:28:11.543
- Not just chocolate, I mean.
- Anything you like.

1197
01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.108
What about... people?

1198
01:28:13.369 --> 01:28:14.761
People?

1199
01:28:16.197 --> 01:28:18.892
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

1200
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.155
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

1201
01:28:22.372 --> 01:28:23.981
But it might have some messy results.

1202
01:28:24.048 --> 01:28:27.407
Look at me. I'm gonna be the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

1203
01:28:27.634 --> 01:28:28.874
Mike, get away from that thing!

1204
01:28:29.026 --> 01:28:30.331
Stop, don't, come back...

1205
01:28:30.548 --> 01:28:32.157
Lights, camera, action!

1206
01:28:34.992 --> 01:28:37.680
Mike! Where are you?

1207
01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:40.072
He's up there, in a million pieces!

1208
01:28:40.290 --> 01:28:43.856
- Mike! Are you there?
- No good shouting here. Watch the screen.

1209
01:28:47.031 --> 01:28:49.335
Mike? Why's he taking so long?

1210
01:28:49.553 --> 01:28:51.597
Million pieces take a
long time to put together.

1211
01:28:51.815 --> 01:28:54.511
- Oh, where are they?
- There's definitely something coming through.

1212
01:28:54.728 --> 01:28:57.468
- Is it Mike?
- Well it's hard to tell, but I...

1213
01:28:58.294 --> 01:29:00.382
Our little group is getting
smaller by the minute.

1214
01:29:00.642 --> 01:29:04.861
Look at me, everybody. I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television.

1215
01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.036
Wow, what a wild trip that was.

1216
01:29:08.253 --> 01:29:10.775
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

1217
01:29:10.799 --> 01:29:14.168
Am I coming in clear? Hey, Mom, I said,
"Am I coming in clear?"

1218
01:29:14.733 --> 01:29:16.691
Great. He's completely unharmed.

1219
01:29:16.907 --> 01:29:19.039
You call that unharmed?

1220
01:29:19.257 --> 01:29:22.214
Wow, that was something
Can I do it again?

1221
01:29:22.450 --> 01:29:24.041
No, there'll be nothing left.

1222
01:29:24.257 --> 01:29:26.389
Don't worry about a
thing, Mom. I feel fine.

1223
01:29:26.606 --> 01:29:28.563
I'm famous. I'm a TV star.

1224
01:29:28.737 --> 01:29:30.781
Wait 'til the kids back
home hear about this.

1225
01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:32.303
Nobody's gonna hear about this.

1226
01:29:32.521 --> 01:29:33.912
Where are you taking me?

1227
01:29:34.174 --> 01:29:35.652
I don't want to go in there!

1228
01:29:35.869 --> 01:29:37.043
Be quiet.

1229
01:29:37.435 --> 01:29:38.522
Well...

1230
01:29:39.174 --> 01:29:42.915
Well, fortunately small boys are
extremely springy and elastic,

1231
01:29:43.089 --> 01:29:46.916
so I think we'll put him in my special
taffy-pulling machine. That should do the trick.

1232
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:48.656
To the taffy-pulling room.

1233
01:29:48.873 --> 01:29:52.613
You'll find the boy in his mother's purse.
But be extremely careful.

1234
01:29:54.614 --> 01:29:56.527
Oh, what's he saying?

1235
01:29:56.788 --> 01:29:59.354
No, no, I won't hold you responsible.

1236
01:30:00.615 --> 01:30:04.355
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say goodbye.

1237
01:30:04.529 --> 01:30:06.356
No, no, don't speak.

1238
01:30:06.530 --> 01:30:10.748
For some moments in life there
are no words. Run along now.

1239
01:30:17.315 --> 01:30:19.455
Adieu, adieu,

1240
01:30:19.794 --> 01:30:22.447
parting is such sweet sorrow.

1241
01:31:29.029 --> 01:31:33.466
So much to do, so much to do,
invoices and bills, letters...

1242
01:31:33.987 --> 01:31:36.467
I must answer that note from the queen.

1243
01:31:37.293 --> 01:31:39.424
Mr. Wonka, what's gonna
happen to the other kids?

1244
01:31:39.606 --> 01:31:40.949
Augustus, Veruca?

1245
01:31:41.077 --> 01:31:42.077
My dear boy,

1246
01:31:42.294 --> 01:31:44.294
I promise you they'll be quite all right.

1247
01:31:44.555 --> 01:31:49.469
When they leave here, they'll be completely
restored to their normal, terrible old selves.

1248
01:31:50.078 --> 01:31:52.688
But maybe they'll be a
little bit wiser for the wear.

1249
01:31:52.905 --> 01:31:54.341
Anyway, don't worry about them.

1250
01:31:54.558 --> 01:31:56.994
Eh, what do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

1251
01:31:57.385 --> 01:32:01.592
Oh, yes, well, I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

1252
01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.336
Straight up the stairs.
You'll find the way.

1253
01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.822
I'm terribly busy. Whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both. Goodbye.

1254
01:32:10.432 --> 01:32:13.868
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1255
01:32:14.172 --> 01:32:16.042
I don't know, Charlie.

1256
01:32:16.694 --> 01:32:18.738
But I'm gonna find out.

1257
01:32:36.439 --> 01:32:39.396
- Mr. Wonka?
- I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1258
01:32:39.613 --> 01:32:42.093
I just wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1259
01:32:42.528 --> 01:32:45.919
The lifetime supply of
chocolate, for Charlie.

1260
01:32:46.441 --> 01:32:47.919
When does he get it?

1261
01:32:48.137 --> 01:32:50.269
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1262
01:32:50.443 --> 01:32:52.573
Because he broke the rules.

1263
01:32:52.791 --> 01:32:55.574
What rules? We didn't see any rules,
did we, Charlie?

1264
01:32:55.661 --> 01:32:57.844
Wrong, sir, wrong!

1265
01:32:58.053 --> 01:33:01.532
Under Section Thirty-Seven B
of the contract signed by him,

1266
01:33:01.706 --> 01:33:05.751
it states quite clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if,

1267
01:33:06.055 --> 01:33:09.012
and you can read it for yourself
in this photostatic copy:

1268
01:33:09.230 --> 01:33:10.709
"I, the undersigned,

1269
01:33:10.882 --> 01:33:13.753
shall forfeit all rights,
privileges, and licenses

1270
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:16.101
herein and herein contained,
etcetera, etcetera...

1271
01:33:16.319 --> 01:33:17.319
fax mentis,

1272
01:33:17.493 --> 01:33:20.450
incendium gloria culpam,
etcetera, etcetera...

1273
01:33:20.668 --> 01:33:23.277
memobis quelitor della cassum!"

1274
01:33:23.495 --> 01:33:26.800
It's all there, black and white,
clear as crystal!

1275
01:33:27.017 --> 01:33:29.192
You stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks.

1276
01:33:29.409 --> 01:33:33.062
You bumped into the ceiling which
now has to be washed and sterilized,

1277
01:33:33.237 --> 01:33:35.237
so you get nothing!

1278
01:33:35.497 --> 01:33:36.803
You lose!

1279
01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.151
Good day, sir!

1280
01:33:39.934 --> 01:33:41.282
You're a crook!

1281
01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:44.456
You're a cheat and a swindler!
That's what you are.

1282
01:33:44.674 --> 01:33:46.631
How can you do a thing like this?

1283
01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:50.458
Build up a little boy's hopes and then
smash all his dreams to pieces.

1284
01:33:50.676 --> 01:33:52.456
You're an inhuman monster!

1285
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.937
I said "good day"!

1286
01:33:58.678 --> 01:34:01.156
Come on, Charlie, let's get out of here.

1287
01:34:01.853 --> 01:34:04.505
I'll get even with him if it's
the last thing I ever do.

1288
01:34:04.679 --> 01:34:07.637
If Slugworth wants a
Gobstopper, he'll get one.

1289
01:34:30.938 --> 01:34:32.454
Mr. Wonka?

1290
01:34:40.472 --> 01:34:42.994
So shines a good deed

1291
01:34:43.254 --> 01:34:45.516
in a weary world.

1292
01:34:46.777 --> 01:34:48.019
Charlie,

1293
01:34:49.517 --> 01:34:51.170
my boy...

1294
01:34:51.822 --> 01:34:53.127
You won!

1295
01:34:53.344 --> 01:34:55.214
You did it! You did it!

1296
01:34:55.431 --> 01:34:58.450
I knew you would. I just knew you would.

1297
01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.791
Oh, Charlie, forgive me for putting
you through this. Please, forgive me.

1298
01:35:02.912 --> 01:35:06.043
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

1299
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:07.479
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

1300
01:35:07.696 --> 01:35:10.175
No, no, that's not Slugworth.
He works for me.

1301
01:35:10.436 --> 01:35:12.740
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1302
01:35:12.914 --> 01:35:15.915
And you passed the test.
You won!

1303
01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:18.307
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir,

1304
01:35:18.525 --> 01:35:21.134
- the grand and glorious jackpot.
- The chocolate?

1305
01:35:21.352 --> 01:35:24.744
The chocolate, yes, the chocolate,
but that's just the beginning.

1306
01:35:24.961 --> 01:35:28.354
We have to get on, we have to get on.
We have so much time, and so little to do.

1307
01:35:28.614 --> 01:35:30.484
Strike that. Reverse it.

1308
01:35:30.702 --> 01:35:32.441
This way please.

1309
01:35:32.876 --> 01:35:34.921
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1310
01:35:35.703 --> 01:35:38.225
Step in, Charlie. Grandpa Joe, sir.

1311
01:35:46.054 --> 01:35:50.011
- This is the Great Glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1312
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:52.621
It's a Wonkavator. An elevator
can only go up and down,

1313
01:35:52.795 --> 01:35:55.926
but the Wonkavator can go sideways and
slantways and longways and backways...

1314
01:35:56.143 --> 01:35:57.448
And frontways?

1315
01:35:57.665 --> 01:36:00.120
And squareways and frontways and
any other ways that you can think of.

1316
01:36:00.144 --> 01:36:04.505
It can take you to any room in the whole factory, just
by pressing one of these buttons. Any of these buttons.

1317
01:36:04.667 --> 01:36:07.277
Just press a button and zing!
You're off.

1318
01:36:08.059 --> 01:36:10.581
And up until now I've pressed them all...

1319
01:36:10.973 --> 01:36:12.408
except one.

1320
01:36:13.235 --> 01:36:14.235
This one.

1321
01:36:15.497 --> 01:36:16.888
Go ahead, Charlie.

1322
01:36:17.062 --> 01:36:18.280
Me?

1323
01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:22.237
There it goes.

1324
01:36:24.412 --> 01:36:25.760
Hold on tight.

1325
01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:29.108
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.

1326
01:36:29.848 --> 01:36:33.283
Faster, faster... If we don't pick up
enough speed, we'll never get through.

1327
01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:34.936
Get through what?

1328
01:36:35.763 --> 01:36:37.632
- You mean we're going...?
- Up and out!

1329
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:40.764
But this roof is made of glass
It'll shatter into a thousand pieces.

1330
01:36:41.024 --> 01:36:43.460
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

1331
01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.809
Hold on, everybody.

1332
01:36:50.027 --> 01:36:52.375
Here it comes.

1333
01:37:07.466 --> 01:37:11.293
- You did it, Mr. Wonka, congratulations!
- Get up. Take a look.

1334
01:37:11.539 --> 01:37:13.873
Grandpa, our town looks
so pretty from up here.

1335
01:37:13.903 --> 01:37:15.164
Yeah, look over here, Charlie.

1336
01:37:15.382 --> 01:37:17.034
I think I see our house.

1337
01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:18.860
Wow!

1338
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:20.774
It really looks beautiful.

1339
01:37:20.991 --> 01:37:22.470
There is my school, Grandpa.

1340
01:37:29.081 --> 01:37:31.168
How did you like the
chocolate factory, Charlie?

1341
01:37:31.473 --> 01:37:34.299
I think it's the most wonderful
place in the whole world.

1342
01:37:34.474 --> 01:37:36.475
I'm very pleased to hear you say that,

1343
01:37:36.735 --> 01:37:39.040
because I'm giving it to you.

1344
01:37:41.217 --> 01:37:42.475
That's all right, isn't it?

1345
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:45.346
- You're giving Charlie the...?
- I can't go on forever,

1346
01:37:45.607 --> 01:37:47.608
and I don't really want to try.

1347
01:37:47.912 --> 01:37:52.826
So, who can I trust to run the factory when I
leave and take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1348
01:37:53.087 --> 01:37:54.391
Not a grown-up.

1349
01:37:54.609 --> 01:37:57.741
A grown-up would want to do everything
his own way, not mine.

1350
01:37:58.089 --> 01:38:01.741
That's why I decided a long time ago
I had to find a child.

1351
01:38:01.959 --> 01:38:03.568
A very honest,

1352
01:38:03.959 --> 01:38:05.351
loving child,

1353
01:38:05.873 --> 01:38:09.222
to whom I can tell all my most
precious candy making secrets.

1354
01:38:09.439 --> 01:38:11.999
- And that's why you sent out the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.

1355
01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:14.701
So the factory's yours, Charlie.
You can move in immediately.

1356
01:38:14.962 --> 01:38:16.919
- And me?
- Absolutely.

1357
01:38:17.354 --> 01:38:19.573
- What happens to the rest of...
- The whole family.

1358
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:21.573
I want you to bring them all.

1359
01:38:25.313 --> 01:38:26.705
But Charlie...

1360
01:38:27.879 --> 01:38:31.575
don't forget what happened to the man who
suddenly got everything he always wanted.

1361
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:32.673
What happened?

1362
01:38:33.054 --> 01:38:35.402
He lived happily ever after.
