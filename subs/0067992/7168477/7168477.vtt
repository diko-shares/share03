1
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.836
All right, all right,
what's it going to be?

2
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.464
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.

3
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.008
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.

4
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:58.553
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!

5
00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.014
- Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

6
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:04.184
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.

7
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.645
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?

8
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.564
- Do you ask a fish how it swims?
- No.

9
00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.316
- Or a bird how it flies?
- No.

10
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.693
No, you don't.

11
00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:14.528
They were born to do it.

12
00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.739
Just like Willy Wonka was born
to be a candy man...

13
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.325
and you were born to be a Wonkerer.

Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

44
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.414
Ah, come along, Charlie.
You're late.

45
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.085
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

46
00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:36.211
You're right.

47
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:39.297
- There you are.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.217
- Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.
- Okay.

49
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.554
Up the airy mountain.

50
00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:30.056
Down the rushing glen.

51
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.392
We dare not go a-hunting.

52
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.520
For fear of little men.

53
00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:37.480
You see...

54
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.150
nobody ever goes in...

55
00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.989
and nobody ever comes out.

56
00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.918
Charlie's late.

57
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.879
He works too hard, for a little boy.

58
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:03.256
He should have some time to play.

59
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.425
Not enough hours in the day.

60
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.677
With you four bedridden
the last 20 years,

61
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:10.722
it takes a lot of work
to keep this family going.

62
00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.433
If only his father were alive.

63
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:17.270
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.

64
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:20.523
In all the years
you've been saying that,

65
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.777
I've yet to see you
set foot on the floor.

66
00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.614
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold.

67
00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.158
Hi, everybody!

68
00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.703
Wake up, Charlie's home!

69
00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.414
Grandpa George.

70
00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.626
Grandma Georgina.

71
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.503
Grandma Josephine.

72
00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.714
Grandpa Joe!

73
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.386
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

74
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:51.221
It's yours too.

75
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.140
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

76
00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:57.310
- It's all we have!
- What are you saying?

77
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.064
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?

78
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.192
What difference
does it make where? He got it.

79
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.152
My first payday.

80
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.155
Good for you, Charlie.
We'll have a real banquet.

81
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.615
Mom?

82
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:13.743
Here's what's left. You keep it.

83
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.162
Except for this.

84
00:08:16.246 --> 00:08:18.790
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.

85
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.670
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.

86
00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.256
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

87
00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:29.801
When bread looks like a banquet,
I have no right buying tobacco.

88
00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.845
Go on, Grandpa.

89
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.180
Please take it.

90
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:44.357
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

91
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.068
There was this strange man there.

92
00:08:47.694 --> 00:08:49.487
I think he was a tinker.

93
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:53.116
He was standing behind me
looking at the factory.

94
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.452
Just before he left, he said:

95
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.955
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out."

96
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.207
And right he was, Charlie.

97
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:04.044
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.

98
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:05.378
Why'd he lock it?

99
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.882
Because all the other chocolate makers
were sending spies

100
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:12.552
dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

101
00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:16.473
Especially Slugworth.
Oh, that Slugworth was the worst!

102
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.684
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!

103
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:23.980
Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

104
00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.776
He locked the gates
and vanished completely.

105
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:30.904
And then, suddenly,
about three years later,

106
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:33.573
the most amazing thing happened.

107
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:36.493
The factory started working again,
full blast!

108
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:40.080
And more delicious candies
were coming out than ever.

109
00:09:40.163 --> 00:09:43.249
But the gates stayed locked so that no one,

110
00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.336
not even Slugworth, could steal them.

111
00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:50.590
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.

112
00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.550
Thousands must be.

113
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:53.634
But who?

114
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.512
Who are they?

115
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:59.265
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

116
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:01.078
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

117
00:10:01.102 --> 00:10:03.436
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

118
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.064
I need an assistant. Give me a hand.

119
00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:13.363
We have nitric acid, glycerine
and a special mixture of my own.

120
00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:16.366
Together it's dangerous stuff,
blows you up.

121
00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.453
But mixed together right,
as only I know how, what's it make?

122
00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:23.873
- I don't know.
- Of course not. Only I know.

123
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:27.627
If you knew, you'd be teaching me
instead of me teaching you.

124
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:32.382
And for a student to teach his teacher
is presumptuous. Is that clear?

125
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.675
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

126
00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.138
Mixed together in the right way,
these dangerous ingredients

127
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.682
make the finest wart remover
in the world.

128
00:10:41.266 --> 00:10:43.685
The trick is to pour equal amounts.

129
00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:47.397
Charlie, you take
the nitric acid and glycerine

130
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.441
and I'll take my special mixture. Ready?

131
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:52.819
Good lad. Pour.

132
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:56.406
Did we do it wrong?

133
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.159
Certainly not. This is for big warts.

134
00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.036
What's going on out there?

135
00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:06.791
Come here. What's happening?

136
00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.335
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!

137
00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:10.753
Are you sure?

138
00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.089
He's giving lots of chocolate away!

139
00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:16.426
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for five people!

140
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.136
Class un-dismissed.

141
00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:21.264
He hid five Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.

142
00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:24.184
- Where did he hide them?
- Inside five Wonka Bars.

143
00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:27.353
- You gotta buy bars to find them!
- Class re-dismissed!

144
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.231
I'll meet you downstairs!

145
00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:33.067
I'm gonna buy the whole store!

146
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.742
Now, details on the announcement

147
00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:43.536
that has captured
the world's attention.

148
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.456
Hidden among the billions of Wonka Bars

149
00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.499
are five gold tickets.

150
00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:53.171
To the five people who find them will
come the most fabulous prize ever:

151
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.548
A lifetime supply of chocolate.

152
00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:59.469
If this were not enough, each winner,
before receiving his prize

153
00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:01.638
will be personally escorted.

154
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:02.805
They're all crazy.

155
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:04.682
Shh. The man's a genius.

156
00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.392
He'll sell a million bars.

157
00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:10.188
Do you think I've got a chance
to find one?

158
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.024
One? I'm counting on you
to find all five!

159
00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:14.817
One's enough for me.

160
00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.069
We have reports

161
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:20.865
that the response is phenomenal.
Wonka Bars are selling

162
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:23.493
at a rate to boggle the mind.

163
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:24.994
It is incredible

164
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.164
the way Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.

165
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.751
While the world searches,
we watch and wait, wondering

166
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:35.588
where it will lead, and how long
the spirit of man will hold up

167
00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:36.923
under the strain.

168
00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:41.302
I still have these dreams, doctor.
And I still can't stop believing them.

169
00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:43.388
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder,

170
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:46.391
to believe in dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

171
00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:49.269
The sooner you accept this,
the sooner you'll get well.

172
00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:54.482
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into
my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.

173
00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:56.901
What did he say?

174
00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.280
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.

175
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:03.491
- You said...
- Shut up! Where's the ticket?

176
00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:05.910
We begin with five Golden Tickets.

177
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:10.873
Like five lucky bolts of lightning
ready to strike any point on the map.

178
00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:13.918
No one knew where or when
the first one would hit.

179
00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.587
But last night we got our answer.

180
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:20.091
While America slept,
the first Golden Ticket was found

181
00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:23.386
in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

182
00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:27.890
We've been waiting for the story,
and we're ready with a live report.

183
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.644
Proud we are,
for the attention of the world

184
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.938
focuses today here in Duselheim.

185
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.607
A community thrust into prominence

186
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:40.445
by the discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

187
00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:43.614
Its finder is the son
of a prominent butcher.

188
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.576
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!

189
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:51.789
Augustus Gloop, the pride of
Duselheim, the fame of Western Germany.

190
00:13:51.873 --> 00:13:54.792
An example for the whole world.

191
00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:57.962
How does it feel to be
the first Golden Ticket finder?

192
00:13:58.046 --> 00:13:59.797
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

193
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.842
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.

194
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:05.511
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...

195
00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:09.766
Mrs. Gloop, would you say
a few words to the audience?

196
00:14:09.849 --> 00:14:13.811
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.

197
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:17.565
He wouldn't do it unless
he needed the nourishment.

198
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.570
Happy birthday, Charlie!

199
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:25.990
Here you are, Charlie.

200
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.533
Thank you.

201
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.208
It's terrific!

202
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.795
Grandmas
Georgina and Josephine, and me.

203
00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.506
I did the end pieces with the tassels.

204
00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.884
And here's a little gift
from Grandpa George and me.

205
00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:47.428
I think I know what this is.

206
00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:51.015
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

207
00:14:51.099 --> 00:14:52.517
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

208
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.645
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- It's not fair to raise his hopes.

209
00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:58.356
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!

210
00:14:58.439 --> 00:14:59.941
Stop it.

211
00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:03.361
- I've got the same chance as anybody.
- You've got more.

212
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:05.029
You want it more.

213
00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:06.823
Go on, open it!

214
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.449
Here goes.

215
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:12.745
- I got it!
- Where?

216
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:14.163
Let's see!

217
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.499
Fooled you, didn't 1?

218
00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.459
You thought I really had it.

219
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.130
Never mind, Charlie.

220
00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.881
You'll find one.

221
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.635
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!

222
00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:29.470
- No, no, no.
- No.

223
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.567
I wanted to be the first
to find a Golden Ticket, Daddy!

224
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.987
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.

225
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.906
I've got every girl on staff
hunting for you.

226
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.325
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?

227
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.954
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!

228
00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:56.164
Give me time!

229
00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:59.500
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?

230
00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:03.171
For five days now,
the entire factory's been on the job!

231
00:16:03.254 --> 00:16:06.090
They haven't shelled a peanut
since Monday!

232
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:09.760
They've been shelling
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!

233
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.179
Make them work nights!

234
00:16:13.264 --> 00:16:15.141
Come along, you girls!

235
00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.060
Put a jerk in it,
or you'll be out on your ears!

236
00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:20.021
And listen, the first girl

237
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:24.817
that finds a Golden Ticket gets
a one-pound bonus in her pay packet!

238
00:16:24.901 --> 00:16:26.944
What do you think of that?

239
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.198
They're not even trying!

240
00:16:30.281 --> 00:16:32.783
They don't want to find it!
They're jealous!

241
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.203
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.

242
00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.747
Nineteen thousand bars
an hour they're shelling.

243
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.333
Seven hundred and sixty thousand
they've done so far!

244
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.542
You promised!

245
00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.295
You promised I'd have it the first day!

246
00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:48.508
You're going to be very unpopular
if you don't deliver soon.

247
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.011
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.

248
00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:53.763
I won't talk to you!

249
00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:57.266
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!

250
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.268
I won't go to school!

251
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:02.188
Veruca, sweetheart, angel.

252
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:05.024
There are only four tickets
left in the world

253
00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:07.860
and the whole world's
hunting for them!

254
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.904
- What can I do?
- I got it!

255
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:12.240
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!

256
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.161
About time too! I want it!

257
00:17:22.208 --> 00:17:25.253
Give me that ticket! It's mine!

258
00:17:25.336 --> 00:17:27.880
I found the Golden Ticket!

259
00:17:33.553 --> 00:17:34.679
Thank God for that.

260
00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:38.015
Aye. Happiness is what counts
with children.

261
00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:40.226
Happiness and harmony.

262
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:45.523
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc

263
00:17:45.606 --> 00:17:48.442
the mad craze
that's sweeping the world.

264
00:17:48.526 --> 00:17:52.780
Whatever corner of the globe we are
in, whichever continent we're on,

265
00:17:52.863 --> 00:17:56.576
the great Wonka Bar search
continues. We're near the end

266
00:17:56.659 --> 00:18:00.162
of our 43rd day
in the Golden Ticket hunt.

267
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.583
Everywhere are signs of anxiety.

268
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:04.792
Every hour,

269
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.920
new shipments
are sent around the globe

270
00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.089
but they're not moving fast enough.

271
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:14.594
As time passes, the men who seek them
become more and more desperate.

272
00:18:14.677 --> 00:18:18.931
Gentlemen, I know how anxious you've
been during these last few days.

273
00:18:19.015 --> 00:18:21.642
But now I think I can safely say

274
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.478
that your time and money
have been well spent.

275
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.774
We're about to witness
the greatest miracle of the machine age.

276
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:32.820
Based on a revolutionary
law of probability, this machine

277
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:36.991
will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining.

278
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.118
Golden Tickets.

279
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:51.922
"I won't tell. That would be cheating."

280
00:18:58.054 --> 00:19:00.431
I am now telling the computer

281
00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:04.685
if it will tell me the correct
answer, I will gladly share with it

282
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:06.562
the grand prize.

283
00:19:12.193 --> 00:19:16.614
"What would a computer do
with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

284
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:25.873
I am now telling the computer exactly
what he can do with the chocolate.

285
00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:31.629
It can happen here too,
unbelievable as it sounds,

286
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.464
right here in America.

287
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:37.468
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest of dreams can come true.

288
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.595
Here she is,

289
00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:43.808
Violet Beauregarde,
finder of Golden Ticket number three.

290
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.726
From Miles City, Montana.

291
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.311
And the proud parents,

292
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:50.731
Mr. Beauregarde,
a local politician, civic leader...

293
00:19:50.815 --> 00:19:53.067
Sam Beauregarde,
"Square Deal" Sam to you

294
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.194
with great giveaway bargains.

295
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:57.822
The finest values in the entire country!

296
00:19:57.905 --> 00:20:00.157
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!

297
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.201
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!

298
00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.954
Here's Golden Ticket number three,
and it's all mine!

299
00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:06.747
How'd it happen, Violet?

300
00:20:06.831 --> 00:20:09.667
I'm a gum chewer,
but when I heard about the tickets,

301
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.378
I laid off gum
and switched to candy bars.

302
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.588
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.

303
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.591
I chew all day, except meals
when I stick it behind my ear.

304
00:20:17.675 --> 00:20:19.343
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!

305
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:24.432
This piece of gum, I've been chewing
for three months. A world record!

306
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.852
It beat the record
held by my friend, Cornelia,

307
00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.854
and was she mad!

308
00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.522
Hi, Cornelia, sweetie.

309
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:34.567
Let me just say,
if any of you folks watching.

310
00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:49.206
- Charlie, what are you doing here?
- I thought I'd walk you home.

311
00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:52.877
I wish I were,
but I'm gonna be here late.

312
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.713
Well, then I guess I'll be going.

313
00:20:55.796 --> 00:20:57.631
Why don't you stay a minute?

314
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.843
Here. Pull up a pile of clothes
and sit down.

315
00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.055
Things all right at school?

316
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.266
- Yep.
- Good.

317
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.769
Go on your newspaper route?

318
00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:10.978
Just finished.

319
00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:12.313
Good.

320
00:21:14.857 --> 00:21:17.026
- I wanted to tell you something.
- Oh?

321
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:21.572
They found the third ticket.

322
00:21:21.655 --> 00:21:22.948
Did they?

323
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.450
Yeah.

324
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.370
I guess I'll be going now.

325
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:30.831
Is that all?

326
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.084
I thought you'd like to know.

327
00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:37.922
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

328
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:41.091
There are only two tickets left,
you know. Just two.

329
00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.719
Pretty soon, just one.

330
00:21:43.803 --> 00:21:45.513
I wonder who the lucky ones will be.

331
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:47.765
If you're wondering,
it won't be me.

332
00:21:47.848 --> 00:21:50.601
If you're wondering,
you can count me out.

333
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:51.685
Charlie.

334
00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:54.188
There are 100 billion people

335
00:21:54.271 --> 00:21:57.525
and only five will find
Golden Tickets.

336
00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:00.945
Even with a sack of money,
you probably wouldn't find one.

337
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:05.658
When this is over, you'll be no different
from the billions who didn't.

338
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:08.786
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.

339
00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:13.082
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

340
00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.543
When? When will they change?

341
00:22:15.626 --> 00:22:18.254
Probably when you least expect it.

342
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:22.508
See you later.

here in the Southwest,
it has actually happened.

374
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:10.300
There's only one Golden Ticket
left in the entire world.

375
00:25:10.384 --> 00:25:13.971
Because right here,
in Marble Falls, Arizona

376
00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:15.973
is lucky winner number four!

377
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:19.977
The name to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teeveel!

378
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.063
- Hey, Mike, can we shut that off?
- No, are you crazy?

379
00:25:23.147 --> 00:25:25.190
He won't answer till station break.

380
00:25:25.274 --> 00:25:27.276
The country wants to hear from you!

381
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.486
Can't you shut up? I'm busy.

382
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:30.904
What a show.

383
00:25:30.988 --> 00:25:32.906
I serve all his dinners here.

384
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.908
He's never been to the table.

385
00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:36.577
- You love TV?
- You bet!

386
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.412
About that Golden Ticket...

387
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:39.997
I want to catch this!

388
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.167
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?

389
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.044
Mike, would you tell us if...

390
00:25:46.712 --> 00:25:48.255
Wait till I get a real one.

391
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:49.339
Colt .45.

392
00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:52.009
Pop won't let me have one yet,
will you?

393
00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.136
Not till you're 12, son.

394
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:02.603
Four down, one to go.

395
00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:06.940
Somewhere out there another
lucky person is moving closer

396
00:26:07.024 --> 00:26:11.820
to finding the last of the most
sought after prizes in history.

397
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:15.032
Though we do envy him, whoever he is,

398
00:26:15.115 --> 00:26:18.202
and might be tempted
to be bitter at our losing

399
00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:21.371
we must remember there are
more important things.

400
00:26:21.455 --> 00:26:23.999
Many more important things.

401
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:28.170
Offhand, I can't think of what they
are, but I'm sure there's something.

402
00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.713
And now for tomorrow's weather.

403
00:26:31.757 --> 00:26:35.427
Why did you wake me up,
Grandpa? Is something wrong?

404
00:26:41.225 --> 00:26:43.602
Grandpa! That money was for tobacco.

405
00:26:43.685 --> 00:26:46.021
I told you, I've given it up.

406
00:26:46.105 --> 00:26:47.564
Go on, open it!

407
00:26:47.648 --> 00:26:49.817
One ticket left. Let's see that gold.

408
00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.277
No, you do it. I can't.

409
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:55.656
We're going to be lucky this time.

410
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:58.200
I've got a funny feeling inside.

411
00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:02.371
Which end shall I open first?

412
00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.624
That end. Just a tiny bit.

413
00:27:07.376 --> 00:27:09.962
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

414
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.049
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.

415
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.884
All right.

416
00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:17.719
Here goes.

417
00:27:23.976 --> 00:27:25.269
You know,

418
00:27:26.145 --> 00:27:30.149
I bet those Golden Tickets
make the chocolate taste terrible.

419
00:27:40.409 --> 00:27:42.578
Lot 403.

420
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:45.164
I can personally guarantee

421
00:27:45.247 --> 00:27:49.126
that this is the absolutely
last case of Wonka Bars

422
00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:50.878
left in the United Kingdom.

423
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:54.673
Shall we start the bidding
at 1000 pounds? Do I hear 10007?

424
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.718
1500 pounds? 20007?

425
00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:01.305
I have 2500 here. 4000 pounds?

426
00:28:01.388 --> 00:28:03.056
4500 pounds?

427
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.892
5000 pou...?

428
00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:06.685
Your Majesty!

429
00:28:10.189 --> 00:28:11.773
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

430
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.401
There isn't anything here to give a clue.

431
00:28:14.484 --> 00:28:16.653
They kidnapped my husband 12 hours ago.

432
00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:18.906
When will we hear?
What do they want?

433
00:28:18.989 --> 00:28:22.576
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We'll wait to hear their demands.

434
00:28:23.202 --> 00:28:25.495
I'll give them anything they want.

435
00:28:25.579 --> 00:28:27.331
All I want is Harold back!

436
00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.296
Go ahead, we're listening.

437
00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.590
Uh-huh.

438
00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:38.425
Uh-huh.

439
00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:42.471
What? Whatever they asked for
they can have.

440
00:28:43.472 --> 00:28:45.849
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

441
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.814
Did you hear me?

442
00:28:53.732 --> 00:28:56.526
It's your husband's
life or your Wonka Bars.

443
00:28:57.903 --> 00:29:00.155
How long do I have to think it over?

444
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:02.783
That's it!

445
00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:05.452
The Wonka contest is all over.

446
00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.704
The final ticket has been found.

447
00:29:07.788 --> 00:29:12.251
We've got a live report coming
in from Paraguay, South America.

448
00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:14.962
It is finished. The end has come.

449
00:29:15.045 --> 00:29:17.881
The last Golden Ticket has been found

450
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:19.466
right here in Paraguay.

451
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:22.636
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta

452
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:26.473
the multi-millionaire owner
of South American gambling casinos.

453
00:29:26.556 --> 00:29:30.185
Here is the most recent picture
of the happy finder.

454
00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:32.980
Turn it off.

455
00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.483
Well, that's that.

456
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.235
No more Golden Tickets.

457
00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:40.487
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

458
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.905
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.

459
00:29:41.989 --> 00:29:46.994
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?

460
00:29:47.077 --> 00:29:49.413
Who's going to tell him?

461
00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:52.582
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

462
00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:54.251
Yeah, let him sleep.

463
00:29:54.334 --> 00:29:56.795
Let him have one last dream.

464
00:30:04.428 --> 00:30:07.431
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.

465
00:30:07.514 --> 00:30:11.268
Which means Friday's test
on what we learned during the week

466
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:13.770
will now be on Monday,
before we've learned it.

467
00:30:13.854 --> 00:30:16.064
Since today's Tuesday,
it doesn't matter.

468
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:18.317
Pencils ready!

469
00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.821
Today, we are going to learn about...

470
00:30:24.197 --> 00:30:25.574
percentages.

471
00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.202
For example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

472
00:30:29.286 --> 00:30:32.456
Suppose there were
1000 Wonka Bars in the world

473
00:30:32.539 --> 00:30:36.460
and you each opened
a certain number of them.

474
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:38.754
That number is

475
00:30:39.087 --> 00:30:40.672
a percent. Understand?

476
00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.594
Madeline, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

477
00:30:46.178 --> 00:30:47.220
About 100.

478
00:30:47.804 --> 00:30:52.642
There are 10 hundreds in 1000,
therefore, you opened 10 percent.

479
00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:55.354
Peter Goff, how many did you open?

480
00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:56.730
A hundred and fifty.

481
00:30:57.272 --> 00:31:01.985
That's 10 percent half over again,
which makes 15 percent. Charlie?

482
00:31:02.069 --> 00:31:04.446
- How many did you open?
- Two.

483
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:07.407
That's easy. 200 is twice...

484
00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:08.867
Not 200.

485
00:31:09.451 --> 00:31:10.869
Just two.

486
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.789
What do you mean, you only opened two?

487
00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:16.249
I don't care much for chocolate.

488
00:31:16.333 --> 00:31:18.502
I can't figure out just two!

489
00:31:18.585 --> 00:31:20.837
Let's pretend you opened 200.

490
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:25.258
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick

491
00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:27.177
you'd use 20 percent of 1000

492
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.138
which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent.

493
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.481
- Hi.
- I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.

494
00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:23.108
Yeah, sure.

495
00:32:23.191 --> 00:32:24.359
What kind?

496
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.529
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumpdiddleumptious?

497
00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:30.657
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumpdiddleumptious.

498
00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:34.744
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.

499
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:49.384
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy!

500
00:32:49.468 --> 00:32:51.720
You'll get a stomachache like that.

501
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.930
- Bye.
- Bye, now.

502
00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:05.066
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

503
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.526
Sure.

504
00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:09.738
Try a regular Wonka Bar.

505
00:33:09.821 --> 00:33:11.156
Fine.

506
00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:21.166
Extra! Extra! Read about the scandal.

507
00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:24.252
- Give me a newspaper.
- All right. All right.

508
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.255
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?

509
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:33.136
- That gambler made a phony ticket.
- There's one Golden Ticket still.

510
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.097
The nerve of that guy,
trying to fool the world!

511
00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:40.519
He was a crook! This means
the contest goes on forever.

512
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:26.773
Hey! You got the last Golden Ticket!

513
00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:29.776
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

514
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:33.613
- It really is gold!
- Come here, kid.

515
00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:35.574
Stand back! Leave the boy alone!

516
00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:38.326
- You're going to kill him.
- Did you see what he's got?

517
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:40.495
- Break it up!
- Over here.

518
00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:43.123
Charlie! Hold on to that ticket!

519
00:34:43.206 --> 00:34:47.711
Run for it! Run straight home!
And don't stop till you get there!

520
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:22.787
I congratulate you, little boy.
Well done.

521
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:25.665
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.

522
00:35:25.749 --> 00:35:27.709
May I introduce myself?

523
00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:29.502
Arthur Slugworth.

524
00:35:29.586 --> 00:35:32.172
President of Slugworth Chocolates, Inc.

525
00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:37.010
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.

526
00:35:37.093 --> 00:35:40.847
Mr. Wonka is working on
a fantastic invention.

527
00:35:41.348 --> 00:35:43.642
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

528
00:35:44.309 --> 00:35:46.394
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

529
00:35:46.478 --> 00:35:49.898
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper

530
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:53.360
and bring it to me
so I can find the secret formula.

531
00:35:53.443 --> 00:35:54.944
Your reward will be

532
00:35:55.028 --> 00:35:57.364
10,000 of these.

533
00:35:57.447 --> 00:35:59.240
Think it over, will you?

534
00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:01.409
A new house for your family,

535
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:04.537
food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

536
00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:07.540
And don't forget the name.

537
00:36:07.624 --> 00:36:09.793
Everlasting Gobstopper.

538
00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:42.367
I've got it! The fifth
Golden Ticket is mine!

539
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.412
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.

540
00:36:45.495 --> 00:36:48.248
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

541
00:36:48.331 --> 00:36:50.959
The last one's fake! It's in the paper!

542
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:54.045
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar
and the ticket was in it!

543
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:57.215
- Charlie.
- Look at it! See for yourself!

544
00:36:57.757 --> 00:36:59.968
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

545
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:05.140
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder
of this Golden Ticket

546
00:37:05.223 --> 00:37:09.227
from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates

547
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:13.606
at 10:00 in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!

548
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:18.778
You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else.

549
00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:22.115
In your wildest dreams,
you could not imagine

550
00:37:22.198 --> 00:37:26.327
the marvelous surprises that await you!"
Charlie, you've done it!

551
00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:28.788
- I can't believe it!
- Grandpa?

552
00:37:28.872 --> 00:37:31.624
It says I can take somebody with me.

553
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:33.418
I wish you could go.

554
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.180
Charlie.

555
00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:53.438
Ahh. That's good, Charlie.

556
00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:55.482
Now help me up.

557
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:10.163
- Oh!
- Are you okay?

558
00:38:10.246 --> 00:38:12.332
I'm fine, Charlie.

559
00:38:17.629 --> 00:38:18.838
Oh, no!

560
00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:20.757
- Easy, Dad!
- Joe!

561
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:23.843
Watch it, Joe!

562
00:38:33.019 --> 00:38:34.521
Look at me!

563
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:39.359
Look at me!

564
00:38:40.026 --> 00:38:42.028
Up and about!

565
00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:46.991
I haven't done this in 20 years!

566
00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:49.369

We've got lots to do! Comb your hair,
wash your face, polish your shoes...

609
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:53.094
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.

610
00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:57.223
Grandpa, on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

611
00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:21.956
Peanuts here. Peanuts. Peanuts.

612
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:23.916
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

613
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.085
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

614
00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:29.964
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!
How do I look?

615
00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:31.632
- You guys ready?
- You're on.

616
00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.468
This is the big day.

617
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:38.598
The day Willy Wonka opens his gates
to shower gifts on the lucky winners.

618
00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:42.101
From all over the globe,
people have gathered, waiting

619
00:42:42.185 --> 00:42:45.354
to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.

620
00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:51.486
Hi, friends! Don't forget
to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...

621
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:54.614
Cut it out, Dad! This is my show!

622
00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:58.576
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?

623
00:43:03.206 --> 00:43:04.957
Come on over here.

624
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.835
Bring the cables over this way.
Come on, quick.

625
00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:10.338
Hey, give me a break. Let me get a shot.

626
00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:14.133
I want to go in first, before anybody.

627
00:43:14.217 --> 00:43:16.094
Anything you say.

628
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:22.767
Save some room for
later, Augustus, liebling.

629
00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:29.482
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.

630
00:43:29.565 --> 00:43:33.111
We're gonna see the greatest
of them all, Mr. Willy Wonka!

631
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:16.505
Thank you.

632
00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.592
Thank you.

633
00:45:20.509 --> 00:45:21.636
Welcome, my friends.

634
00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:23.971
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

635
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:25.848
Would you come forward?

636
00:45:27.225 --> 00:45:29.185
Get back! Come on, Veruca!

637
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:37.485
That's Slugworth,
the man I told you about.

638
00:45:42.365 --> 00:45:45.326
Welcome. It's nice to have you here.

639
00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.078
I'm so glad you could come.

640
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:51.082
This is going to be such
an exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

641
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.251
I think you will.

642
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:55.294
Please show your Golden Tickets.

643
00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:58.089
I'm Veruca Salt.

644
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.424
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!

645
00:46:00.508 --> 00:46:02.760
You look pretty in that mink coat!

646
00:46:02.843 --> 00:46:04.595
I've got three others.

647
00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:09.058
And Mr. Salt. Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?

648
00:46:09.141 --> 00:46:10.268
Augustus Gloop.

649
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:12.436
Augustus, my dear boy!

650
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.273
Good to see you,
and in such fine shape!

651
00:46:15.356 --> 00:46:19.151
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.

652
00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:22.655
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.

653
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:24.323
What kind of gum you got?

654
00:46:24.407 --> 00:46:27.618
- Charming! Charming!
- Sam Beauregarde here!

655
00:46:27.702 --> 00:46:29.328
What a genuine pleasure.

656
00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:32.790
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.

657
00:46:32.873 --> 00:46:34.875
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"

658
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:37.670
I'm Mike Teevee.

659
00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:39.338
Wham, you're dead!

660
00:46:39.422 --> 00:46:40.840
Wonderful to meet you!

661
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:42.842
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

662
00:46:42.925 --> 00:46:45.636
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.

663
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:48.556
- Charlie Bucket.
- Well, well. Charlie Bucket.

664
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:51.851
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?

665
00:46:51.934 --> 00:46:53.561
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

666
00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:57.148
Delighted. Overjoyed.
Enraptured. Entranced.

667
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:58.607
Are we ready? Yes! Good!

668
00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.484
In we go!

669
00:47:34.894 --> 00:47:38.022
Now, hats, coats, galoshes over here.

670
00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:41.192
Hurry, we have so much time
and so little to see.

671
00:47:41.275 --> 00:47:43.361
Wait a minute! Strike that.

672
00:47:43.444 --> 00:47:45.821
Reverse it. Thank you.

673
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.118
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

674
00:47:51.202 --> 00:47:52.703
Boy, what weird coat hangers!

675
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:59.794
Surprises around every corner,
but nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.

676
00:47:59.877 --> 00:48:02.880
As soon as your outer
vestments are in hand,

677
00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:04.298
we'll begin.

678
00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:09.345
Now, will the children kindly step up here?

679
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:22.274
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

680
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:24.985
I didn't know we had to sign anything.

681
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:26.570
I can't read the bottom.

682
00:48:27.238 --> 00:48:29.156
Violet, you first.

683
00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:31.492
- Sign here.
- Hold it!

684
00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:33.911
Let me through. Don't sign anything.

685
00:48:33.994 --> 00:48:35.621
What's this all about?

686
00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.456
Standard form of contract.

687
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.293
Don't talk contracts. I use them
myself. They're for suckers.

688
00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:44.797
You wouldn't begrudge me
a little protection? A drop?

689
00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.132
I don't sign anything.

690
00:48:46.215 --> 00:48:49.093
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.

691
00:48:49.176 --> 00:48:50.928
I'm sorry. House rules.

692
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:55.307
- I'm going! Don't you dare stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.

693
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:59.728
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.

694
00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:05.317
Nicely handled! She's a girl
who knows where she's going. Violet.

695
00:49:05.401 --> 00:49:07.278
What's all that small print?

696
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.531
Any problems? Dial information.
Thanks for calling.

697
00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:14.076
- Mike, Augustus.
- Violet! Violet!

698
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.745
I assume there's
an accident indemnity clause?

699
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:18.247
Never between friends.

700
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.542
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed
his wife's insurance policy.

701
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.794
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

702
00:49:23.878 --> 00:49:25.004
What about me, Grandpa?

703
00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:27.590
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.

704
00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:29.175
Let's go in! Come on!

705
00:49:29.258 --> 00:49:33.095
Patience, patience!
Everything has to be in order.

706
00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:34.972
Everyone signed? Yes?

707
00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:36.765
Good. On we go!

708
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.902
Ninety-nine,

709
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:49.737
forty-four,

710
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.739
100 percent pure.

711
00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.159
Just through the other door, please.

712
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.455
There's some mistake here.

713
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.874
There is no other door.

714
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:03.292
There's no way out!

715
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:06.462
I know there's a door here some place.

716
00:50:06.545 --> 00:50:08.547
I don't like this, Wonka!

717
00:50:08.631 --> 00:50:10.049
Is this a trick?

718
00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:13.802
Mr. Wonka, help!
I'm getting squashed! Save me!

719
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:16.305
Is it my soul that calls me by name?

720
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:17.806
Let me out or I'll scream!

721
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:20.726
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!

722
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:24.188
Question time will come at the end
of the session. We must press on.

723
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.357
Come along. Come along.

724
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.609
- Ah, here we are.
- Don't be a fool.

725
00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.236
That's the way we came in.

726
00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:32.780
It is? Are you sure?

727
00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:35.074
We've just come through there.

728
00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:36.867
How do you like that?

729
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.913
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka? A fun house?

730
00:50:41.997 --> 00:50:43.207
Why? Having fun?

731
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.376
I've had enough. I'm not going in there.

732
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.211
We're getting out of here.

733
00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:50.881
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.

734
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:52.508
Better press on.

735
00:50:53.217 --> 00:50:55.928
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!

736
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:58.305
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

737
00:50:58.389 --> 00:51:01.684
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

738
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:04.186
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.

739
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.689
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.

740
00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:09.233
You can't squeeze me through that door.

741
00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:11.777
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.

742
00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:13.445
My dear friends,

743
00:51:13.529 --> 00:51:16.574
you are now about to enter the nerve center

744
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:18.867
to the entire Wonka factory.

745
00:51:19.868 --> 00:51:24.081
Inside this room,
all of my dreams become realities.

746
00:51:24.164 --> 00:51:26.292
And some of my realities become dreams.

747
00:51:26.375 --> 00:51:30.129
And almost everything you'll see
is eatable... Edible.

748
00:51:30.212 --> 00:51:32.548
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

749
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:34.300
Let me in, I'm starving!

750
00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:37.553
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.

751
00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:39.346
We don't want anyone to lose that.

752
00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:42.766
Yet.

753
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.768
Now, the combination.

754
00:51:44.852 --> 00:51:46.895
This is a musical lock.

755
00:51:49.398 --> 00:51:51.775
- Rachmaninoff.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

756
00:51:53.235 --> 00:51:54.903
boys and girls...

757
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:57.615
the Chocolate Room.

758
00:52:35.778 --> 00:52:37.529
Hold your breath. Make a wish.

759
00:52:38.656 --> 00:52:39.782

It's industrial waste.

795
00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:14.079
A ruined watershed, Wonka. It's polluted.

796
00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:15.162
It's chocolate.

797
00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:16.748
That's chocolate?

798
00:56:16.832 --> 00:56:18.125
That's chocolate.

799
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.793
A chocolate river!

800
00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:22.462
The most fantastic thing
I've ever seen.

801
00:56:22.546 --> 00:56:24.131
10,000 gallons an hour.

802
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:28.260
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

803
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:33.098
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

804
00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:36.727
No other factory in the world
mixes chocolate by waterfall.

805
00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:40.814
But it's the only way
if you want it just right.

806
00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:43.233
Grandpa, look there, across the river!

807
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:44.735
Little men!

808
00:56:44.818 --> 00:56:46.695
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

809
00:56:46.778 --> 00:56:48.864
Now we know who makes it.

810
00:56:48.947 --> 00:56:52.242
I never saw anybody
with an orange face before.

811
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:55.162
Funny-looking people.

812
00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.914
What are they doing?

813
00:56:56.997 --> 00:56:58.749
It's creaming and sugaring time.

814
00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:02.377
- They can't be real people.
- Of course they're real people.

815
00:57:02.461 --> 00:57:03.503
Nonsense!

816
00:57:03.587 --> 00:57:06.381
- No, Oompa Loompas.
- Oompa Loompas?

817
00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:07.466
From Loompaland.

818
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:09.468
Loompaland? There's no such place!

819
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:11.136
Excuse me, dear lady...

820
00:57:11.219 --> 00:57:12.596
I teach geography.

821
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:14.181
Then you know all about it.

822
00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:16.058
And what a terrible country it is.

823
00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:19.436
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

824
00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:22.689
The poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless,

825
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:25.317
they would get gobbled up.

826
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:29.071
A Wangdoodle would eat ten of them
for breakfast and think nothing of it.

827
00:57:29.154 --> 00:57:30.781
And so I said:

828
00:57:30.864 --> 00:57:33.784
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety,

829
00:57:33.867 --> 00:57:36.870
away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers

830
00:57:36.954 --> 00:57:40.624
and Snozzwangers
and rotten Vermicious Knids."

831
00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:44.628
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

832
00:57:44.711 --> 00:57:47.506
I'm sorry, questions
must be submitted in writing.

833
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:49.716
So, in the greatest of secrecy,

834
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.470
I transported the entire population
of Oompa Loompas here.

835
00:57:53.553 --> 00:57:57.557
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!

836
00:57:57.641 --> 00:58:00.769
All right, I'll get you one
before the day's out.

837
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:03.146
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

838
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:04.648
Can it, you nit!

839
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:07.025
Mm. This is terrific.

840
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:10.529
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

841
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:14.491
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

842
00:58:14.574 --> 00:58:18.787
Don't do that! My chocolate
must never be touched by human hands.

843
00:58:19.621 --> 00:58:22.416
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!

844
00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:24.710
- Please, I beg you! Augustus!
- Aah!

845
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.337
My chocolate!

846
00:58:27.421 --> 00:58:28.547
Help!

847
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:32.551
My chocolate! My beautiful chocolate!

848
00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:35.846
Don't just stand there! Do something!

849
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:38.306
Help. Police. Murder.

850
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:41.059
- Quick, Charlie, here.
- Grab this!

851
00:58:42.019 --> 00:58:43.729
What's happening to him?

852
00:58:43.812 --> 00:58:45.981
- He's drowning.
- Dive in! Save him!

853
00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:47.107
Oh, it's too late.

854
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.483
- Too late?
- He's had it now.

855
00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:51.194
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!

856
00:58:51.737 --> 00:58:52.946
Where is he?

857
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.031
Watch the pipe.

858
00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:56.825
How long is he going to stay down?

859
00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:59.953
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.

860
00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:03.457
- His coat's going up the pipe!
- Call a plumber!

861
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.585
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?
It's his stomach.

862
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:08.295
Help! Help!

863
00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:11.048
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?

864
00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:15.010
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.

865
00:59:15.927 --> 00:59:18.263
How long will it take
to push him through?

866
00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:20.432
The suspense is terrible.

867
00:59:20.515 --> 00:59:21.683
I hope it'll last.

868
00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:26.563
He'll never get out.

869
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.065
Yes, he will. Watch.

870
00:59:28.148 --> 00:59:30.942
Remember, you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

871
00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:34.988
He'll be made into marshmallows
in five seconds!

872
00:59:35.072 --> 00:59:38.700
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?

873
00:59:38.784 --> 00:59:41.495
It doesn't go to the Marshmallow
Room, it goes to the Fudge Room.

874
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:44.664
You terrible man!

875
00:59:45.457 --> 00:59:48.168
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room,
but look sharp

876
00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.587
or her boy will go in the boiler.

877
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.506
You boiled him up!

878
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:56.343
Nil desperandum. Across the desert
lies the promised land.

879
00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:57.928
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

880
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:02.557
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.

Wow, what a boat!

898

Ooh! Looks good enough to eat!

899
01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.644
That's quite a nice little canoe.

900

and a star to sail her by."

All aboard!

902
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.527
Ladies first. That means Veruca.

903
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.697
If she's a lady, I'm a Vermicious Knid.

904
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.451
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.

905
01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.870
She's tres jolie,
but is she seaworthy?

906
01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:50.624
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.

907
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:54.669
- You took good care of the August kid.
- Everybody aboard!

908
01:01:56.087 --> 01:01:58.048
You're going to love this.

909
01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.507
Just love it.

910
01:02:30.038 --> 01:02:34.084
I want a boat like this. A beautiful
paddleboat, that's what I want.

911
01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:36.711
What she wants is a kick in the pants.

912
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.505
I'm gonna be seasick.

913
01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.298
- Try one of these.
- What are they?

914
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.801
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in seven colors.

915
01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.552
Spitting's a dirty habit.

916
01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.304
I know a worse one.

917
01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.986
- What business you in, Salt?
- Nuts.

918
01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.501
- Where are we going?
- I don't like that tunnel.

919
01:03:16.584 --> 01:03:17.919
I want off!

920
01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:23.091
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!

921
01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.094
I don't like this ride, Daddy!

922
01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.975
We're going too fast!

923
01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:33.643
We're going to sink!

924
01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.979
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?
- Faster!

925
01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.148
Close your eyes and hang on tight!

926
01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.196
- What is this, a freakout?
- This isn't funny!

927
01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.907
You can't possibly see
where you're going!

928
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.118
You're right. I can't.

929
01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.078
This would make a great series!

930
01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:55.540
- Wonka.
- This is kind of strange.

931
01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:58.460
Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun! Ha-ha!

932
01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:02.380
- This is terrific.
- I want to get off the boat, Wonka!

933
01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:05.633
Aah! I may get sick!

934
01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.302
This has gone too far!

935
01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:10.263
Tell that little guy
to turn us around!

936
01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:12.223
Aah! Now I am gonna be sick!

937
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.435

Yes!

950

For the rowers keep on rowing.

951
01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:07.153
And they're certainly not showing.

952

953
01:05:15.954 --> 01:05:17.997

- Wonka,

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.417
- this has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.

955
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.543
Stop the boat!

956
01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.130
- We're there.
- Where?

957
01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.339
Here.

958
01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:30.009

but a giant step for us.

961
01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.308
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.

962
01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:41.146
- What a nightmare!
- Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

963
01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.439

967
01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:52.657

970
01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:09.299
Now remember, no messing about.

971
01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:12.093
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

972
01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:13.303
No telling what?

973
01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:17.974
All of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

974
01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:21.769
Old Slugworth would give his false
teeth to get inside for five minutes.

975
01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:24.898
So don't touch a thing!

976
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.134
Inventing Room?
Looks more like a Turkish bath.

977
01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:56.721
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

978
01:06:56.804 --> 01:06:59.474
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does the cleaning?

979
01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:01.059
Shouldn't you wear gloves?

980
01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:03.394
You'll have health inspectors after you.

981
01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:07.398

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.569
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

1009
01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.821
Too cold! Far too cold.

1010
01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.324
That's gourmet cooking for you.

1011
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.160
No! Don't, please.

1012
01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.371
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

This is the most secret machine
in my factory.

1014
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.378
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?

1015
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.049
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!

1016
01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:20.782
What's it do?

1017
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:23.910
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

1018
01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.870
Did you say Everlasting Gobstoppers?

1019
01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:29.207
For children with little money.
You can suck them forever.

1020
01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:31.167
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!

1021
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.293
- Me too!
- And me!

1022
01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:35.171
Fantastic invention.
Revolutionize the industry.

1023
01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:38.966
You suck them and they'll
never get smaller. Never.

1024
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.259
I think.

1025
01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:42.470
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?

1026
01:09:42.553 --> 01:09:46.265
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.

1027
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.142
Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?

1028
01:09:48.226 --> 01:09:49.811
- Me!
- I do!

1029
01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:55.316
I can only give them to you if you
swear to keep them for yourselves.

1030
01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.404
And never show them
to another soul as long as you live.

1031
01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:01.906
- Agreed?
- Agreed!

1032
01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:05.660
Good. One for you,

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:18.047
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.

1038
01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:21.175
If you'll follow me,

1039
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.678
I have something special to show you.

1040
01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.263
It's special, all right.

1041
01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.099
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.

1042
01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.434
What a contraption!

1043
01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:30.643
Isn't she scrumptious?

1044
01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:33.646
My revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

1045
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.150
Now, button, button, who's got the button?

1046
01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:39.068
It's over there.

1047
01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:40.778
- Here?
- Yeah.

1048
01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.088
What you are witnessing,
dear friends,

1049
01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:02.216
is the most enormous miracle
of the Machine Age.

1050
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.344
The creation of a confectionery giant!

1051
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:19.192
- That's all?
- Don't you know what this is?

1052
01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.152
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

1053
01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:24.822
It's the most fabulous,
sensational gum in the world!

1054
01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:26.365
What's so fab about it?

1055
01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:29.744
- This gum is a three-course dinner.
- Bull!

1056
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.914
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!

1057
01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.249
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

1058
01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:37.168
If it's gum, that's for me.

1059
01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.420
Violet, don't do anything stupid.

1060
01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:41.589
What's it taste like?

1061
01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:44.634
Madness! It's tomato soup!

1062
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:47.428
It's creamy. I can feel it
running down my throat!

1063
01:11:47.512 --> 01:11:49.347
Stop. Don't.

1064
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:51.182
Why doesn't she listen?

1065
01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:54.018
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

1066
01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:55.436
Great soup!

1067
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.438
The second course is coming.

1068
01:11:57.522 --> 01:11:59.899
Roast beef and a baked potato! Mm!

1069
01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.193
With sour cream?

1070
01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:06.531
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!

1071
01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:10.785
Blueberry pie and cream! It's
the most marvelous I've ever tasted!

1072
01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.412
- What's happening?
- Cool it!

1073
01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:14.705
Let me finish.

1074
01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.541
You're face is turning blue!

1075
01:12:16.624 --> 01:12:18.709
You're turning violet, Violet!

1076
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:19.877
What do you mean?

1077
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.255
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.

1078
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:24.882
Look what it's done to my kid!

1079
01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:29.011
It always goes wrong when
we come to the desserts. Always.

1080
01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:30.805
Violet, what are you doing?

1081
01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.974
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!

1082
01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:35.226
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?

1083
01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.395
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

1084
01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:40.022
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

1085
01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:42.733
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

1086
01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.486
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!

1087
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.238
I'll break you for this!

1088
01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.407
- I'll get it right in the end.
- Help!

1089
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:53.035
- Help!
- Oh, we've got to let the air out of her!

1090
01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.079
- There's no air.
- Hm?

1091
01:12:55.162 --> 01:12:56.247
- That's juice.
- Juice?

1092
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.584
Would you roll her down
to the Juicing Room?

1093
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.836
- What for?
- For squeezing.

1094
01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.422
She has to be squeezed
before she explodes.

1095
01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:07.174
- Explodes!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:07.485
I got a blueberry for a daughter!

1112
01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:12.281
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"

1113
01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:15.284
Shall we roll on?

1114
01:14:19.538 --> 01:14:20.873
Thank you.

1115
01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:26.170
Well, well, well! Two naughty,
nasty little children gone.

1116
01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:30.132
Three good, sweet little children left.

1117
01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:35.012
Hurry, please. Long way to go yet.

1118
01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:40.768
Wait a minute. Must show you this.

1119
01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.562
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

1120
01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:45.773
Lick an orange, tastes like an orange.

1121
01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:49.819
Lick a pineapple, it tastes
like a pineapple. Try it!

1122
01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.988
Mm! I got a plum!

1123
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:55.574
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!

1124
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.953
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

1125
01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.497
The snozzberries
taste like snozzberries.

1126
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.834
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?

1127
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.504
We are the music makers.

1128
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.424
And we are the dreamers of dreams.

1129
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:14.510
Come along.

1130
01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:20.057
Something very unusual in here.

1131
01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:23.894
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink.

1132
01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:25.104
Yet.

1133
01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:26.814
What's it making?

1134
01:15:26.897 --> 01:15:31.485
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you
with gas and the gas lifts you

1135
01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.362
off the ground like a balloon.

1136
01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:36.323
Oh, isn't it high? Gosh!

1137
01:15:36.407 --> 01:15:38.034
But it's still too powerful.

1138
01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:40.161
Let us try some! Please!

1139
01:15:40.244 --> 01:15:44.707
No, no. There'd be children
floating all over the place!

1140
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.751
Come along, don't hang about.

1141
01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.837
You'll be wild about this next room.

1142
01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:53.549
Let's take a drink. Nobody's watching.

1143
01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:56.010
A small one won't hurt us. Whoops!

1144
01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:02.558
Mmm! Not bad.

1145
01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:05.728
Well?

1146
01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.354
Nothing's happening.

1147
01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:11.025
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why...!

1148
01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:12.818
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1149
01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:15.112
I feel terribly strange.

1150
01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:18.741
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie, but... Aah! Oh! Oh!

1151
01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:23.162
- Mr. Wonka isn't gonna like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!

1152
01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:25.164
- You're right.
- I'll try and get down.

1153
01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:28.292
All right, Charlie,
but please be careful.

1154
01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:33.255
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!

1155
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.425
- I haven't swum in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!

1156
01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.469
I don't think I ought to.

1157
01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.057
Oh. Oh, this is great!

1158
01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.975
Hey, try this, Grandpa!

1159
01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:47.103
- All right, Charlie. Wait for me!
- Wee!

1160
01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.187
Wee!

1161
01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:50.815
Wee!

1162
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:54.193
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

1163
01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.446
This is really great!

1164
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.657
Look, I'm a bird!

1165
01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:03.994
I feel light as a feather.

1166
01:17:04.745 --> 01:17:05.913
Look down.

1167
01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:08.082
We're really high now.

1168
01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:13.921
Watch this, Grandpa.

1169
01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:19.051
Wonderful, Charlie!

1170
01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.720
- Wow! Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!

1171
01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:23.222
Come on, Grandpa.

1172
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.765
All right.

1173
01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:29.270
- Hey, you did it, Grandpa!
- Oh.

1174
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.398
Oh, I think I hit an air pocket.

1175
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.650
You can fly to the moon this way!

1176
01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.986
Let's fly south for the winter.

1177
01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.529
Why not?

1178
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:41.365
I'm a bird!

1179
01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:42.908
I'm a plane!

1180
01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.285
I'm...

1181
01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:46.287
going too high!

1182
01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:49.290
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

1183
01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:50.666
Help!

1184
01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:52.501
Grandpa, the fan!

1185
01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.753
It'll chop us to bits!

1186
01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.047
We're in trouble! I can't stop!

1187
01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:58.591
It's pulling me in!

1188
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.843
I can't stop!

1189
01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:03.220
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!

1190
01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.724
There's nothing to grab on to! Help!

1191
01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:08.267
We'll be killed!

1192
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:10.394
Help! Help!

1193
01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:14.190
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan! Oh! Oh!

1194
01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.444
Ooh! I'm going down! Quick!

1195
01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.614
Burp! If you don't,
it'll cut you to ribbons!

1196
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.949
- I can't! Help!
- You've gotta burp!

1197
01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:26.452
It's the only way!

1198
01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.746
Attaboy! Burp again!

1199
01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:30.789
Attaboy! Come on!

1200
01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.127
That's wonderful, Charlie!

1201
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:45.221
Grab on to me.
We're gonna be all right now.

1202
01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.188
Good boy!

1203
01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.191
From now on
we keep our feet on the ground.

1204
01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.401
Let's catch up to the others!

1205
01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.781
I know what you're thinking.

1206
01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:06.033
They can't be doing what they're doing.

1207
01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:08.285
But they are. They have to.

1208
01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:10.454
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.

1209
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.415
These are the geese
that lay the golden eggs.

1210
01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:16.043
They're larger than ordinary geese.

1211
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.420
They're quadruple-size,
which produces

1212
01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.757
octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.

1213
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.093
- But Easter's over!
- Shh.

1214
01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.678
They don't know that.

1215
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.013
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

1216
01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:32.017
What happens if they drop an egg?

1217
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.979
An omelet fit for a king, sir.

1218
01:19:35.062 --> 01:19:36.563
Are they chocolate eggs?

1219
01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:39.775
Golden chocolate eggs! A great delicacy.

1220
01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:41.443
But don't get too close.

1221
01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.488
The geese are temperamental,
so we have the Eggdicator.

1222
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:45.656
Eggdi-what?

1223
01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:49.243
The Eggdicator tells
the difference between a good egg

1224
01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:50.619
and a bad egg.

1225
01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:54.039
If it's good, it's shined up
and shipped over the world.

1226
01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:56.542
But if it's a bad egg,

1227
01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.836
down the chute.

1228
01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.633
An educated Eggdicator.

1229
01:20:04.717 --> 01:20:06.510

All right, sweetheart.

1235
01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:21.525
You'll get one as soon as we get home.

1236
01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:24.111
No, I want one of those!

1237
01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:27.072
How much do you want for the goose?

1238
01:20:27.156 --> 01:20:28.866
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.

1239
01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:31.493
- She can't have one.
- Who says I can't?

1240
01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:33.412
- The man with the hat.
- I want one!

Down the garbage chute.

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:39.913
The garbage chute.

01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:41.957

1282
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.917
To the furnace.

The furnace?

1284
01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.548
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.

1285
01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:52.259
- She could be stuck inside the tube.
- Inside the...

Ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles

1318

bubble cola, double cola,
double-bubble burp-a-cola

1319
01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:50.460
all that carbonated stuff

1320
01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:53.463

in one of those things.

1321
01:24:53.547 --> 01:24:55.591
I'm sorry I asked.

1322
01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:58.969
Would Slugworth pay extra
to know about this?

1323
01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:02.014
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

1324
01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:04.683
Everybody set?

1325
01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:05.976

1326
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:09.187
It should. It's got more gas

1327
01:25:09.271 --> 01:25:13.358
Hold on. I'm gonna really
open her up and see what she can do.

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:32.336
- Aah!
- Oh!

1332
01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.881
It's getting in my eyes!

1333
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.008
It's even in my shoes!

1334
01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:41.136
I'm soaked! It'll never come out!

1335
01:25:41.219 --> 01:25:42.512
It's sticking to my gun!

1336
01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:45.015
Oh!

I'm dry-cleaned!

1340
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.455
Hey, Grandpa!

1341
01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:11.083
What was that we just went through?

1342
01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.668
Hsaw Aknow.

1343
01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:15.837
- Is that Japanese?
- It's "Wonka Wash" spelled backwards.

1344
01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.173
That's it. The journey's over.

1345
01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:20.676
Finest bath I've had in 20 years!

1346
01:26:20.759 --> 01:26:22.260
Let's do it again!

1347
01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:25.722
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

1348
01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:30.519
If the Lord meant us to walk,
he wouldn't have invented roller skates.

1349
01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.521
Would you put these on?

1350
01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:34.898
We have to be careful.

1351
01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:37.734
There's dangerous stuff inside.

1352
01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:41.655
Wonkavision!

1353
01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.324
My very latest and greatest invention.

1354
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.369
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.

1355
01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:50.539
You all know how
ordinary television works.

1356
01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:53.125
- You photo...
- You photograph something

1357
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.961
then it's split
into millions of pieces

1358
01:26:56.044 --> 01:27:00.006
that fly through the air down
to your TV set in the right order.

1359
01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:04.010
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

1360
01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:06.263
If they can do it with a photograph,

1361
01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:09.099
why can't I do it
with a bar of chocolate?

1362
01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:16.481
I shall now send this chocolate bar
from one end of the room to the other.

1363
01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:20.110
It has to be big, because
when you transmit by television,

1364
01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.028
it always ends up smaller.

1365
01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:24.364
Goggles on, please.

1366
01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:28.702
Lights, camera,

1367
01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:30.036
action!

1368
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:33.540
You can remove your goggles.

1369
01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:35.584
Where's the chocolate?

1370
01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:38.044
It's flying over our heads
in a million pieces.

1371
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.549
Now watch the screen.

1372
01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:46.720
Here it comes.

1373
01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:49.431
There it is.

1374
01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:50.932
Take it.

1375
01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:54.394
- How? It's just a picture.
- All right, you take it.

1376
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.605
It's real!

1377
01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.733
Taste it! It's delicious.
It's just gotten smaller.

1378
01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.028
It's perfect!

1379
01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.196
Unbelievable!

1380
01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.198
- A miracle!
- It's a TV dinner!

1381
01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:08.825
- It's Wonkavision.
- It could change the world!

1382
01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.869
Can you send other things?

1383
01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.163
- Not just chocolate, I mean.
- Anything you like.

1384
01:28:13.246 --> 01:28:16.333
- What about people?
- People?

1385
01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:20.545
Hm. I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

1386
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:23.799
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

1387
01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.634
But it might have messy results.

1388
01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:29.054
I'm gonna be the first person
to be sent by television!

1389
01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.180
Get away!

1390
01:28:30.263 --> 01:28:34.559
- Stop. Don't. Come back.
- Lights, camera, action!

1391
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.314
Mike! Where are you?

1392
01:28:39.397 --> 01:28:41.525
He's up there, in a million pieces.

1393
01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:43.360
Mike, are you there?

1394
01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:46.321
No good shouting, dear.
Watch the screen.

1395
01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:50.909
Mike? Why is he taking so long?

1396
01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.578
A million pieces
take time to put together.

1397
01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.164
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.

1398
01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.542
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...

1399
01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:01.962
- Oh!
- Our group's getting smaller by the minute!

1400
01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:06.424
Look at me! I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

1401
01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:09.678
Wow, what a wild trip that was!

1402
01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:12.430
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened!

1403
01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.725
Am I coming in clear?
I said, am I coming in clear?

1404
01:29:15.809 --> 01:29:18.353
Great. He's completely unharmed.

1405
01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:20.564
You call that unharmed?

1406
01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:23.775
Wow, that was something.
Can I do it again?

1407
01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:27.946
- No, there'll be nothing left!
- Don't worry, Mom. I feel fine.

1408
01:29:28.029 --> 01:29:30.198
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!

1409
01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.450
Wait till the kids back home hear!

1410
01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:35.495
- Nobody's gonna hear!
- Where are you taking me?

1411
01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.289
I don't want to go in there!

1412
01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:38.665
Be quiet!

1413
01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:40.083
Well?

1414
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:44.546
Fortunately, small boys
are extremely springy and elastic.

1415
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:48.550
So I think we'll put him in
my special taffy-pulling machine.

1416
01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.218
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.

1417
01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:54.180
The boy's in his mother's purse.
But be careful.

1418
01:29:54.264 --> 01:29:56.057
Taffy pull...?

1419
01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:57.309
What's he saying?

1420
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.979
No, I won't hold you responsible.

1421
01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:05.984
Oh. And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say goodbye.

1422
01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.986
- Ah...
- No, no! Don't speak!

1423
01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:12.365
For some moments in life,
there are no words. Run along, now.

1424
01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:23.793
Adieu, adieu,
"parting is such sweet sorrow."

I must answer that note
from the queen.

1443
01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:40.996
What will happen to the others?

1444
01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:42.497
Augustus? Veruca?

1445
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:46.001
My dear boy, they'll be quite all right.

1446
01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:51.047
When they leave they'll be restored
to their normal, terrible old selves.

1447
01:31:51.631 --> 01:31:54.342
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.

1448
01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:56.011
Don't worry.

1449
01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:58.555
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

1450
01:31:59.055 --> 01:32:03.184
Oh, yes. Well, I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

1451
01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:05.228
Straight up the stairs. I'm terribly busy.

1452
01:32:05.311 --> 01:32:08.857
A whole day wasted.
Goodbye to you both. Goodbye.

1453
01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:15.447
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1454
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.657
I don't know, Charlie.

1455
01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:20.035
But I'm gonna find out.

1456
01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:41.056
- Mr. Wonka?
- I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1457
01:32:41.139 --> 01:32:43.683
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1458
01:32:44.434 --> 01:32:47.312
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.

1459
01:32:48.021 --> 01:32:49.564
When does he get it?

1460
01:32:49.647 --> 01:32:51.900
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1461
01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.235
Because he broke the rules.

1462
01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:57.238
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?

1463
01:32:57.322 --> 01:32:59.491
Wrong, sir! Wrong!

1464
01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:03.161
Under Section 37-B
of the contract signed by him,

1465
01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:07.457
it states clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if

1466
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:10.668
and you can read it
for yourself in this copy:

1467
01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:12.337
"I, the undersigned

1468
01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.423
shall forfeit all rights,
privileges and licenses

1469
01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:17.634
"herein contained," et cetera.

1470
01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:28.436
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!

1471
01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.855
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!

1472
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.692
You bumped into the ceiling
which now has to be sterilized!

1473
01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:36.945
So you get nothing!

1474
01:33:37.028 --> 01:33:38.446
You lose!

1475
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:40.698
Good day, sir!

1476
01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:42.909
You're a crook.

1477
01:33:43.493 --> 01:33:46.121
A cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are!

1478
01:33:46.204 --> 01:33:48.289
How can you do this?

1479
01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:52.127
Build up a little boy's hopes
and then smash his dreams to pieces!

1480
01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:54.003
You're an inhuman monster!

1481
01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:56.506
I said, good day!

1482
01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.679
Come on, Charlie. Let's get out of here.

1483
01:34:03.429 --> 01:34:06.141
I'll get even if it's the last thing I do.

1484
01:34:06.224 --> 01:34:09.185
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.

1485
01:34:32.292 --> 01:34:33.960
Mr. Wonka?

1486
01:34:42.051 --> 01:34:44.679
"So shines a good deed

1487
01:34:44.762 --> 01:34:47.140
in a weary world."

1488
01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.684
Charlie.

1489
01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:52.729
My boy.

1490
01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:54.772
You won!

1491
01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:56.858
You did it! You did it!

1492
01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:59.944
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!

1493
01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:04.240
Oh, Charlie, forgive me
for putting you through this. Please.

1494
01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:07.702
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

1495
01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:09.120
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

1496
01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:11.873
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!

1497
01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:14.375
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1498
01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:17.503
And you passed the test. You won!

1499
01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.964
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!

1500
01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.800
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?

1501
01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:26.387
The chocolate, yes.
But that's just the beginning!

1502
01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:30.058
We have so much time
and so little to do!

1503
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:32.143
Strike that. Reverse it.

1504
01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:34.020
This way, please!

1505
01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:36.522
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1506
01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:39.776
Step in, Charlie. Grandpa Joe, sir.

1507
01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:51.579
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1508
01:35:51.663 --> 01:35:54.249
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.

1509
01:35:54.332 --> 01:35:57.961
But the Wonkavator can go
sideways, slantways, backways.

1510
01:35:58.044 --> 01:35:59.128
And frontways?

1511
01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:01.130
And any ways you can think of.

1512
01:36:01.714 --> 01:36:06.094
It'll take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.

1513
01:36:06.177 --> 01:36:08.888
Press a button, and zing! You're off.

1514
01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:12.141
And up until now, I've pressed them all.

1515
01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:13.977
Except one.

1516
01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:15.645
This one.

1517
01:36:17.063 --> 01:36:18.523
Go ahead, Charlie.

1518
01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.899
Me?

1519
01:36:22.568 --> 01:36:23.778
There it goes!

1520
01:36:24.529 --> 01:36:27.282
Hold on tight.

1521
01:36:27.824 --> 01:36:30.827
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.

1522
01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:34.956
Faster! If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.

1523
01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:37.208
- Through what?
- Aha.

1524
01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:39.294
- You mean, we're going...?
- Up and out.

1525
01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:42.422
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1000 pieces!

1526
01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.966
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

1527
01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:50.388
Hold on, everybody!

1528
01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.933
Here it comes!

1529
01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:12.952
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.

1530
01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:15.330
Grandpa, our town looks so pretty.

1531
01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.583
Look over here, Charlie.
I think I see our house.

1532
01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:20.793
Wow!

1533
01:37:20.877 --> 01:37:22.420
It really looks beautiful.

1534
01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:24.047
There's my school!

1535
01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:32.680
How did you like the chocolate factory?

1536
01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:35.933
It's the most wonderful place in the world.

1537
01:37:36.017 --> 01:37:38.186
I'm pleased to hear you say that,

1538
01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:40.563
because I'm giving it to you.

1539
01:37:41.731 --> 01:37:44.108
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?

1540
01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:46.861
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.

1541
01:37:46.944 --> 01:37:49.155
And I don't really want to try.

1542
01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:54.494
Who can I trust to run the factory and
take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1543
01:37:54.577 --> 01:37:56.037
Not a grownup.

1544
01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.540
A grownup would do everything
his own way, not mine.

1545
01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:03.378
That's why I decided long ago
that I had to find a child.

1546
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.296
A very honest,

1547
01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:06.923
loving child,

1548
01:38:07.673 --> 01:38:10.885
to whom I can tell all my
precious candy-making secrets.

1549
01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:13.513
- That's why you sent the tickets.
- That's right.

1550
01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:16.224
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.

1551
01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.476
- And me?
- Absolutely.

1552
01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:21.229
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.

1553
01:38:21.312 --> 01:38:23.189
I want you to bring them all.

1554
01:38:26.859 --> 01:38:28.277
But Charlie...

1555
01:38:29.445 --> 01:38:33.241
don't forget what happened to
the man who got everything he wanted.

1556
01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:34.492
What happened?

1557
01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.953
He lived happily ever after.
