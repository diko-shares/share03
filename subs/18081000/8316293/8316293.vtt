1
00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.729
Mommy?

2
00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.110
What's on your face, Dawn?

3
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.445
Makeup.

4
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.864
I wanna look nice
for the first day.

5
00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:31.740
Dad?

6
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:32.907
Yeah.

7
00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.617
I made sandwiches for the bus.

8
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.470
Do you think I put
too much ketchup?

9
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.454
What?

10
00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.495
No.

11
00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:39.956
There's no such thing
as too much ketchup,

12
00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.416
you know that.

13
00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.543
Smoke alarm!

14
00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.211
Yay, waffles are ready!

15
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.467
We could keep 'em
with us for the week.

16
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.986
I mean, we, we lose
the money, but...

17
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.488
We can't have this
conversation again

18
00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.514
'cause the bus is
coming in an hour.

19
00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:58.767
Just a week.

20
00:00:58.808 --> 00:00:59.934
Camp is good, remember?

21
00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.102
Camp is, camp is good.

22
00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:01.770
Camp is good.

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.020
Camp is good.

24
00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:06.691
And you got some t-shirts?

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.401
Yeah, in here.

26
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.235
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.028
Good, good, good.

28
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.070
Yes.

29
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.073
Yes.

30
00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:13.907
You got everything.

31
00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:14.741
I have everything.

32
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:15.533
I already checked.

33
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.576
Okay, I know.

34
00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.827
You're doing great.

35
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.289
Undies?

36
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.039
Undies?

37
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.166
I'm wearing 'em.

38
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.502
- Grace?
- What?

39
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.837
Serious, what?

40
00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.591
What, only taking one pair?

41
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.467
Duh.

42
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.134
I only have one butt.

43
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.970
Honey, you're eight.

44
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.473
Yeah, but 14%
of girls get their periods

45
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.765
by the age of 10.

46
00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:41.518
Zip.

47
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.144
What is in here?

48
00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.313
Well, not that much.

49
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.193
And the youngest recorded case

50
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.154
of a girl giving birth
was a five-year-old.

51
00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:55.031
Wait, I'm not done talking.

52
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.908
- Okay.
- In Peru in 1938.

53
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.662
Let's just take the
whole box then.

54
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:07.168
And, girls, it is totally normal
to feel homesick at camp.

55
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.336
Okay?

56
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.923
So when you're away from
your family, it can be hard.

57
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.007
So look,

58
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.485
if you get that feeling
in your chest

59
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.010
and it kind of overwhelms you,

60
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.052
it's fine.

61
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.199
Just take a moment and you
think of a happy memory,

62
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.267
something that we all
did together as a family.

63
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.311
And when that happens,
you'll feel better.

64
00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.105
Are, are you crying?

65
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.982
No, I'm not.

66
00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.942
Of course I am not crying.

67
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.110
I'm a grownup, I'm not...

68
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.319
It's okay to cry, though.

69
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.172
Just so you know,
crying is totally fine.

70
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.698
Good, pep talk.

71
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.866
Thanks.

72
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.077
Don't worry.

73
00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:43.663
You're not there for
long, right?

74
00:02:43.704 --> 00:02:44.539
Hey, it's only seven days.

75
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.373
What's seven days, right?

76
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.374
Seven days is nothing.

77
00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.375
We have seven gnomes.

78
00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:48.585
Seven gnomes for seven days.

79
00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.019
We'll count down the
days per gnome.

80
00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:51.355
Don't worry, it's
gonna go by quick.

81
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.380
Okay?

82
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:53.590
Take care of Daddy.

83
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:55.025
This is the camp
where you met Mommy.

84
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.110
- I love you so much.
- Yeah, a long time ago.

85
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.444
Maybe we'll meet our
husband there too.

86
00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.405
You'll meet your husbands
there, okay?

87
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.709
You're gonna meet your husbands.

88
00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:03.242
You won't have the same
husband, that's, that's illegal.

89
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.285
Muah, okay. I love you so much.

90
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.560
- I love you.
- Bye.

91
00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:06.686
Goodbye, you guys.

92
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:08.271
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

93
00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.748
I'm gonna think about you
every second of the day.

94
00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.250
I'll you see you in a
very short week.

95
00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:12.274
Fly right by.

96
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.276
God.

97
00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:15.944
Okay.

98
00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.572
It's...

99
00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:18.907
Camp is good. Camp is good.

100
00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.326
Camp is good. Camp is good.

101
00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.262
You know, it's not too late
for me to throw my body

102
00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:24.412
in front of the moving bus

103
00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:25.774
and stop this
craziness right now.

104
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:27.749
It's good for them.

105
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.000
We done good.

106
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.640
So what do we do now?

107
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.564
I literally have no idea.

108
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.983
I mean, we could drive
to the gymnastics studio

109
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.737
and just sit in the
parents' waiting area.

110
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:58.947
Yeah. I don't know.

111
00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.781
As comforting as that sounds-

112
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:00.925
Ooh, we could go for brunch.

113
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:01.950
We used to like brunch.

114
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.784
Yeah, bru, the bru...

115
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.743
Definitely.

116
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.828
Ooh, we could go see a matinee.

117
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.870
Yeah. Yeah.

118
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:08.915
When was the last time
we went to see a matinee?

119
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.083
Do they still have matinees?

120
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:10.625
- Is that still even a thing?
- I don't...

121
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.667
Probably not.

122
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.839
We could make some sex.

123
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:20.591
Yeah.

124
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.331
- Let's totally make some sex.
- We're gonna make some sex.

125
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.557
Ha-ha! Found 'em.

126
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:29.394
Wait! Hold on!

127
00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.728
Whoa.

128
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.665
We don't have to close the door.

129
00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.816
We can be as loud as we want.

130
00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.150
Yeah.

131
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.405
I am going to be so loud.

132
00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:49.306
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

133
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.474
- No.
- You used to like when I,

134
00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.207
when I had the extra finger in-

135
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:52.166
No, no.

136
00:04:52.207 --> 00:04:53.334
No, I do, I do.

137
00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.416
- Okay.
- Totally, totally.

138
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.637
You good?

139
00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:05.679
Yeah.

140
00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:18.275
Sorry.

141
00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.547
- Too much teeth?
- No, no, no, no, no.

142
00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:22.780
I just...

143
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:24.032
My foot was, was asleep.

144
00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:25.073
I'm good.

145
00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:32.165
Do you wanna just?

146
00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.306
My God.

147
00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:49.807
My God, I think...

148
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.392
I think I'm coming.

149
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:54.520
Me too.

150
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:56.230
I'm coming right inside you.

151
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.961
Testicles.

152
00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:21.130
Yep, they're balls.

153
00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:25.718
It's the least attractive
part of the male anatomy.

154
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.554
Yeah, and that's saying a lot.

155
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.264
I think this is the longest

156
00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.600
I've ever stared at
a pair of these.

157
00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.685
You know, I'm very
uncomfortable.

158
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.770
Emma?

159
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:36.687
Emma Michaels?

160
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.606
God. Marlon.

161
00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.441
- My God.
- My God.

162
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.693
I can't believe it's
Emma Michaels.

163
00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:43.735
My...

164
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.131
I had, like, the biggest
crush on you in art school.

165
00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:47.155
Wow.

166
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.635
Well, you still have that thing
where you just say things.

167
00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.534
What?

168
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:51.369
Without a filter.

169
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.411
No, I don't.

170
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.932
- I didn't do that, did I?
- Yeah, you just did.

171
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.125
You just did it when you
said you had a crush on me.

172
00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:57.959
On no, it was a major crush.

173
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.793
I kept a journal about it.

174
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.128
You just did it again.

175
00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.730
Well, no, I had photos
in a special binder.

176
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.548
How the hell are you?

177
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.590
I'm, I'm good.

178
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.383
I'm fine.

179
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.968
- I'm great.
- Yeah?

180
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.511
Married? Kids?

181
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.512
All of the above.

182
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.139
Yeah, I married Josh, actually.

183
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.306
My God.

184
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.183
You married your
boyfriend from camp.

185
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.686
Wow, that's so adorable.

186
00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:21.023
I mean, we, we broke
up on and off, you know,

187
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:24.402
and played the field
before we settled down.

188
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.155
And now, you know, we
have two beautiful little girls.

189
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.531
Let me show you their Halloween-

190
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.407
No, no, no, no, no.

191
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.867
That's okay. No.

192
00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:32.302
People without kids are
always pretending they care

193
00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.512
to see photos of
other people's kids,

194
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.538
but really we're
just being polite.

195
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.000
No, no filter.

196
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.585
Yeah.

197
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.461
My God.

198
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.838
So, is this your gallery?

199
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.256
Yeah. It's all mine.

200
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.591
Um, yeah,

201
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.860
I finally realized that
I was far better suited

202
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.510
to appreciate the work of others

203
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.346
than to produce anything
of value myself, um,

204
00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:55.016
like these bad boys right here.

205
00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:57.894
What do you think
of these testicles?

206
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.530
Like.

207
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.533
Really?

208
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.575
No.

209
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.037
Emma, what do you think?

210
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:16.871
Honestly?

211
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:17.872
Yeah.

212
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.875
I mean,

213
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.797
no one really wants
to look at balls.

214
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.677
My God.

215
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.056
You're right.

216
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.894
Balls are totally gross.

217
00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:42.813
Jacques.

218
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.458
Yeah, can you, can you
take this one down?

219
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.501
No. -And,

220
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.901
- and, and those two.
- You don't-

221
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:47.943
And...

222
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.157
Yeah, and, and that
one over there.

223
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.033
You're kidding.

224
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:54.909
No, my apologies

225
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:55.951
I...

226
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.997
My God, you're crazy.

227
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.040
My God.

228
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.418
My God.

229
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.419
Sorry.

230
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.461
Wendy.

231
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.048
My name is Wendy.

232
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:10.925
My gosh.

233
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:11.967
I'm so sorry.

234
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.929
Um, Wendy, this is Marlon.

235
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.597
We went to art school together.

236
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.473
Yeah, I got that.

237
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.642
Wendy and I are teaching

238
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.937
this winter break art camp

239
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.315
for at-risk youth just at the
rec center down the street.

240
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.568
The kids are amazing.

241
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.820
This one girl, Aisha,

242
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.283
has more talent at 15
than I, like, ever had.

243
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.159
She, like, blows my
mind every day.

244
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.121
Wow. Well, I would love
to come and see her work.

245
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:39.996
Yeah, you should.

246
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.077
You could come by anytime.

247
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.043
And that would give me an
excuse to come see you.

248
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.877
I can't believe you're married.

249
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:47.980
I mean, I used to fantasize

250
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.714
about having a bubble
bath with you.

251
00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:50.673
That's very specific.

252
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:51.715
Well, not naked, though.

253
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:53.884
I mean you were, you were
wearing a green bikini.

254
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.970
Always green for some reason.

255
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.263
You're doing it again.

256
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.306
Right.

257
00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.807
Sorry. -No.

258
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:00.849
Yes?

259
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:15.823
Yeah.

260
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.117
I don't know, it seems
a little, um,

261
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.036
unnecessarily sexualized.

262
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:22.203
No?

263
00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:24.332
How so?

264
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:25.373
Um, well,

265
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.171
you can pretty much
see her nipple there.

266
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:33.007
And she's fellating a banana.

267
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:36.469
And your problem with this is?

268
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.681
Well it's, it's an ad
for, for fruit.

269
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.975
Yeah, this is what
the client wants.

270
00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.851
Okay.

271
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:44.893
Have we tried to, like,

272
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.230
gently steer the client
in another direction?

273
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.527
Yeah, we're gonna stick
with a general approach

274
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:54.921
of giving the client
what they want.

275
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:55.945
Okay?

276
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.865
Yeah, you're the
packaging editor, Josh.

277
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.785
Just focus on editing
the package.

278
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:01.952
Okay.

279
00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:10.670
- Hey.
- Hi.

280
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.004
Good meeting?

281
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.216
Everybody here hates me.

282
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.050
Not me.

283
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.010
I find you amusing.

284
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.905
Kelly, what do you think
of that ad right there?

285
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.014
That reminds me of Gary's penis.

286
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.350
What, Gary, that's
the married guy?

287
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:25.410
And, and,

288
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.478
and his penis looks
like a banana?

289
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.646
Yeah, like that one.

290
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.398
The one on the right.

291
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.525
So,

292
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.194
how often would you say you
and are having an orgasm:

293
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.363
A, once a day; B, twice a day;

294
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:38.614
C, three times a day;

295
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:42.576
or D, you are constantly
in an orgasmic fog?

296
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.913
Oral counts and anal counts.

297
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.540
Well, anal definitely counts.

298
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.251
So don't spare any
details, I'm not squeamish.

299
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.294
Wait, tho, tho, those
are the options?

300
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.464
I mean, the, the minimum
in there is, is, is once a day?

301
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.632
Yeah.

302
00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.217
Why?

303
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.093
Nothing.

304
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.094
It's just, you know,

305
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.929
when you're married
for 10 years-

306
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:03.055
"When you're ma..."

307
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.951
No, see, this is exactly what
I've been trying to tell you.

308
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.953
This monogamy is just
created by a patriarchal society

309
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.354
that totally suppresses
any sexual promiscuity.

310
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.939
It is bullshit.

311
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.857
So what?

312
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.526
Like once, a week?

313
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.738
Yeah. I mean, that
sounds about right.

314
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:19.864
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

315
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.198
-What? -Dude?

316
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.200
I was kidding.

317
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.202
You ha, you have
sex once a week?

318
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.747
Why are you suddenly so
interested in my sex life?

319
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.123
Don't be such a narcissist.

320
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.791
I'm interested in
everybody's sex life,

321
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.334
especially married people.

322
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.878
-Okay. -Wait.

323
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.796
So this is, this is
research for your,

324
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.607
for your affair with
Gary, is it?

325
00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:40.968
Forget it.

326
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.970
I'm gonna figure it out myself.

327
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.013
My God.

328
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:46.766
What do these people
want from me?

329
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.434
Hello.

330
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.643
Kelly speaking.

331
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.978
No-

332
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.579
So you've gone back to
layering color over text?

333
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:55.501
But this time some
of the text is illegible.

334
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.880
That's interesting
choices, Aisha.

335
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.048
Thanks.

336
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.426
So of all your work,

337
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:07.388
is there one that you'd
like to try and finish?

338
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.390
No, thanks.

339
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.267
No.

340
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:12.726
Then they'd just be

341
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.895
closed.

342
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.063
They'd be, like,

343
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.274
dead.

344
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.988
Okay. That's it for today.

345
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.031
I'll see you tomorrow.

346
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.051
Everyone, grab
your folders on the way out.

347
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.744
Aisha, this is great work.

348
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.997
This is really special.

349
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.750
No one else seems to think so.

350
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.669
Do you care what they think?

351
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.630
Trust me, they're jealous.

352
00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.056
Marlon?

353
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.641
What are you doing here?

354
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.102
You invited me to see
your students' work.

355
00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:56.145
And I came,

356
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:57.622
even though the
term at-risk youth

357
00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:59.732
makes me very uncomfortable.

358
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.277
Okay. Well, um, you're
safe 'cause they're all gone.

359
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.742
I'm just gonna get my
stuff from the staff room.

360
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.368
Whoa.

361
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.661
What have we here?

362
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.246
That's Aisha.

363
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.932
That's the student I
was telling you about.

364
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:16.790
Well, you weren't kidding.

365
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.167
These are, these are terrific.

366
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.169
I love the half
finished aesthetic.

367
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.795
I know, right?

368
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.339
She's amazing.

369
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.507
You're amazing.

370
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.635
That was weird.

371
00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:28.719
Yeah.

372
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.821
No, this, this whole
thing's weird.

373
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.472
I, it's weird that I
came down here.

374
00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:33.074
I, I should really get
back to the gallery.

375
00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.576
You, you should come
see me there sometime.

376
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.893
It wouldn't be as-

377
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.095
-Weird. -Yeah.

378
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.648
Um, yeah.

379
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:43.108
I, I'll come sometime

380
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.902
just stop by.

381
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.153
-Okay. -Okay.

382
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.156
What?

383
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.658
Great.

384
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.093
Okay, I should leave
'cause I have an erection.

385
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.494
Okay.

386
00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.971
But don't worry, it might
not be from the hug.

387
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.182
It, it, it could be from seeing
your student's great work

388
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.458
It's probably a little of both,

389
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.167
but mostly from the hug.

390
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.209
Bye.

391
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.023
I have judo in 20 minutes.

392
00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.065
What?

393
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.694
What are you thinking about?

394
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.533
Not on the list.

395
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.284
Well, it's not.

396
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:38.122
Every time you call me a
little bitch it loses impact.

397
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.540
I don't even hear it anymore.

398
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.625
It literally has no
effect on me.

399
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.710
Yeah?

400
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.111
How about fucktard?
Is that better?

401
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.315
Or, or what about OCD,
control freak, asshole, shit tits?

402
00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.841
My God.

403
00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:51.301
You do know I can smell
your breath from here, right?

404
00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:52.845
What did you eat today?

405
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.555
Was it somebody ass?

406
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:57.057
Did you eat someone's
ass for lunch?

407
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.684
Goddamn!

408
00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.518
Hey, Josh.

409
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.561
- My gosh.
- What?

410
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:03.063
- It's Andrew and Janice.
- Hey, guys.

411
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.398
You wanna finish your
thought for Josh and Emma?

412
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.652
You were saying something
about my, shit tits.

413
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:09.569
Um, we're good.

414
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.404
Yeah, no, I think we're,

415
00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:11.780
I think we're okay.

416
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:15.284
So, guys, how,
how's it, how's it going?

417
00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:16.785
We're separating.

418
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.288
Janice is moving out tomorrow.

419
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.164
I'm sorry.

420
00:17:20.204 --> 00:17:21.832
Yeah, so, wh, why-

421
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.833
Why are we separating?

422
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.710
Where to begin?

423
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.396
Well, you could
start with the lies.

424
00:17:27.378 --> 00:17:28.578
I was gonna lead with the fact

425
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.275
that you haven't touched
me in two years.

426
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.342
Yeah, and why, why
would I touch you?

427
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.928
All you do is tell lies.

428
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.970
I was,

429
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.241
I was just gonna ask why you
guys are shopping together

430
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:40.350
if you, if you're
moving out tomorrow.

431
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.439
That's a great fucking question.

432
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.196
Are you okay?

433
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:56.533
Yeah. Yeah.

434
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.577
I'm o, I'm okay.

435
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.370
The kids are devastated.

436
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.039
And, um,

437
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.541
we're probably gonna
have to sell the house,

438
00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.293
and I'm gonna die alone.

439
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.841
Clean up in Aisle 6.

440
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.427
They just, they
seemed like the best couple.

441
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.512
I, I know.

442
00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.346
I know.

443
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:18.597
It's like,

444
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.849
I guess things just turn
on a dime so quickly.

445
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.393
One day they've got that
honeymoon glow and the next day-

446
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.563
Why did you lie about
ejaculating the other day?

447
00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.689
I don't know.

448
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.276
Do we lie to each other?

449
00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:33.070
No, we don't lie to each other.

450
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.238
We're us, all right?

451
00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.280
I mean, I, I, I...

452
00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:37.282
I mean, I, I, I, I don't.

453
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.493
Why, do you, do, do you lie?

454
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:43.412
I mean,

455
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.918
I sort of faked my orgasm too.

456
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.919
What?

457
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.796
You, you, you, what?

458
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:51.838
Come on,

459
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:53.757
it's totally normal
for a woman to fake it.

460
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.175
For a guy, that's fucked up.

461
00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.260
That's not...

462
00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.347
No, that's, that's like
reverse sexism or something.

463
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.682
That is a double standard.

464
00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:02.516
And I'm not just gonna
stand... Now I think

465
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.267
you're avoiding the question.

466
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.308
Wow.

467
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.689
Look, we love each other, right?

468
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.023
We're great parents together.

469
00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.608
We make a great team.

470
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.336
It's just married
life, you know?

471
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.322
I mean, the sex becomes
less important, I guess.

472
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:18.550
Yeah, but don't you
think it's weird

473
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.658
we don't talk about it?

474
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.035
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

475
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:22.786
I don't know.

476
00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.621
It's a can of worms.

477
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.917
I mean, it's like that mango
chicken stir fry you make.

478
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.420
How exactly?

479
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.507
Well, you know, I don't
love it, um,

480
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.342
but I eat it and I
don't make a fuss

481
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:40.095
'cause that's just
part of the deal.

482
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.809
Maybe if I added cashews?

483
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.102
Let's not overreact, okay?

484
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.812
We're not Andrew and Janice.

485
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.856
We, we can figure this out.

486
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:54.568
We've had many years
of sex, great sex.

487
00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.738
We know how to bang, right?

488
00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.490
Yeah, that's never been
a problem for us, right?

489
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:03.827
I mean, you know, it's not
like we haven't sown our oats.

490
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.430
You know, I had sex with a
reasonable amount of women.

491
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.496
Yeah. I know, I know.

492
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.164
You don't have to
go through the list.

493
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:07.998
I've had my fun too.

494
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.334
I had, I had my slutty year.

495
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.375
Yeah, can you...

496
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:12.753
We talked about you
not calling it that.

497
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:13.587
Can we not?

498
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.714
Okay, everything I've ever read,

499
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.841
the main complaint about sex

500
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.428
is that one person thinks
of it more than the other.

501
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.430
Okay. Well, then that's
not our problem, right?

502
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.933
Because we, we have a
shared disinterest in sex,

503
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.143
like a, like a mutual apathy.

504
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:30.353
Yeah.

505
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:32.605
Just...

506
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.484
But then...

507
00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:36.318
What?

508
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.653
What? What?

509
00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:38.445
I don't know.

510
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.780
I...

511
00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:41.406
It's just...

512
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:42.324
This is probably nothing.

513
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.617
It's just these past few days

514
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.411
I've been thinking
a lot about sex.

515
00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:47.412
Hey, that's cool.

516
00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:48.580
I get it.

517
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.416
I mean, well, I've been
working out more.

518
00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:53.436
I've been, I've been
watching what I eat, you know?

519
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.460
It's sort of...

520
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:55.921
It's really it's about
portion control, mostly

521
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.089
I'm...

522
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.215
Shit, you...

523
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.343
You've been, you,

524
00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.654
you've been thinking
about having sex

525
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.638
with people who aren't me.

526
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.644
It's just we have this one week,

527
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.229
this one week to...

528
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.939
We could fuck in every
room in the house

529
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:14.999
without the kids barging in,

530
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:18.402
but we're just...

531
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.569
We're not.

532
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.657
Okay. All right.

533
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.075
Look,

534
00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:29.663
we got time, right?

535
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:30.789
Let's not...

536
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.684
We got, like, five more
days, right?

537
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:33.625
Yes.

538
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.835
I wanna fix this.

539
00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:35.669
Let's fix this.

540
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.545
Okay. All right.

541
00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:37.838
So, like, what are we thinking?

542
00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:40.507
Like maybe like, like
an orgy with like,

543
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:41.842
Butter.

544
00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.719
Like a vat of butter.

545
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.137
Now I want butter.

546
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:47.139
Or I could get like a,

547
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.682
that enlargement
surgery for my penis,

548
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.076
- for my little tiny penis.
- Can you please stop?

549
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.851
Don't, please.

550
00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:51.892
Hey, hey.

551
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.105
Whatever it takes.

552
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.753
I mean, this isn't
rocket science.

553
00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.030
We, our sex has
become mechanical.

554
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:04.382
It's just, it's just
unsurprising.

555
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:05.406
Okay.

556
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.536
So let's surprise each other.

557
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.847
I'm just not the right
person to be giving sex advice.

558
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:29.890
I'm a serial monogamous.

559
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.060
Well, wasn't Tom into
some weird stuff?

560
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.329
Didn't you tell me
he was into like-

561
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.729
Furries, furries.

562
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:39.733
The giant animal costumes
that are used as mascots.

563
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.278
So, okay.

564
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.906
So you would dress up
in the mascot costume

565
00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:47.532
- and have sex?
- No, God, no.

566
00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:48.408
No, no.

567
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.535
He was curious and he, you know,

568
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:53.121
found some websites.

569
00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:56.124
I think that's as
far as it went.

570
00:22:56.166 --> 00:23:00.545
I just wanna do something,
like, surprising,

571
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:02.756
something he would never expect,

572
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:03.798
something,

573
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.301
I don't know, like,

574
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.219
adventurous,

575
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.347
a little freaky but sexy, fun,

576
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.015
like, I don't know,

577
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:14.643
like, like a sex swing.

578
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.436
That's a thing, right?

579
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.478
A sex swing?

580
00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.500
I, I mean, I've never done
anything like that, that's...

581
00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:23.568
Or I don't know, like, um-

582
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.028
Like a, like a threesome.

583
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.198
A threesome?

584
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.366
Maybe or not.

585
00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:31.743
No, no, nevermind.

586
00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:32.887
- Forget about that.
- No, no, no, no, no.

587
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.703
It's a good idea.

588
00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.705
I've just, um...

589
00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:38.875
I don't know if we could
actually go through with that.

590
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.627
'cause who would...

591
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.297
Like, Marlon?

592
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:49.302
No, obviously not Marlon.

593
00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.697
That would be a terrible
idea, Em.

594
00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.931
Yeah.

595
00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:56.184
A girl would make more
sense, probably.

596
00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:57.436
Marlon?

597
00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:00.272
You sure jumped to
Marlon pretty quickly.

598
00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.609
Are you thinking-

599
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.194
What?

600
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.236
Wait.

601
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.031
Okay. We trust each
other, so we have that.

602
00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:10.824
We're friends.

603
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:11.825
Whoa.

604
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:12.867
I wasn't...

605
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.662
Gosh.

606
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.497
Shit.

607
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.539
Shit. No.

608
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:22.419
- I am, I am so sorry.
- I am so...

609
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.753
No, no. Don't silly, no.

610
00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:24.504
I just, I just-

611
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:25.546
I mean, no.

612
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.609
I just mean theoretically,
hypothetically speaking,

613
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:32.179
you would be the perfect
candidate if that...

614
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.805
-Well, just, I mean-
-Yeah, why?

615
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.016
Because with another girl
it would, it could be weird.

616
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.518
It, at least I know with you,

617
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.770
Josh is totally not your type.

618
00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.190
No, I suppose that's,
that's a good point.

619
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:45.108
And, like,

620
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.195
it's been a little while since
you've been with Tom, right?

621
00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.237
Yeah, yeah.

622
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:54.034
I have been a little
lonely, I guess.

623
00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:56.495
And you've been with
guys, you've...

624
00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:57.696
-Girls. -Yeah.

625
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.874
Just not at the same time.

626
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.376
Yeah.

627
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:05.504
Forget it. I was joking.

628
00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:11.551
But it could be fine.

629
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.515
- I mean, it's crazy.
- I mean,

630
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.265
- it's totally crazy.
- Yeah.

631
00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:18.850
Totally crazy.

632
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.892
But

633
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:24.856
not completely, like,
stupid or gross or..

634
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.651
- You know?
- Are we doing this?

635
00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:28.818
- Are we?
- I don't know.

636
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.736
- Okay.
- Are we?

637
00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:30.904
I don't know.

638
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:31.946
I mean...

639
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.201
Okay, how about this?

640
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.038
Okay.

641
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.415
Come over for dinner.

642
00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:43.457
Yes.

643
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.253
- Tonight.
- Okay.

644
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:49.005
Just dinner, like,
no expectations,

645
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.967
and we'll see what-

646
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:53.717
Happens.

647
00:25:55.303 --> 00:25:56.303
Hey?

648
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.265
Yeah.

649
00:25:58.306 --> 00:25:59.307
Yeah.

650
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:01.935
Nope, no way.

651
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:02.811
- I can't do it.
- My God.

652
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:03.852
Can you relax?

653
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.063
She might not even be into it.

654
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:06.356
We left it open.

655
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.525
Wait, you what?

656
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.610
No, that, that's, that's worse.

657
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.797
What, I gotta try and
like read her signs or s...

658
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.507
I, I'm not gonna have
a clue what's going on.

659
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:15.907
My God.

660
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.284
I think I might have diarrhea.

661
00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:18.785
Do you feel like you
have diarrhea?

662
00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:20.036
No!

663
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.205
I thought this was like
every man's fantasy.

664
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.039
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.124
In, in theory.

666
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.501
My gosh.

667
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.521
I, I should be getting
a medal for this.

668
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:31.548
This is like me being the
best wife on the planet.

669
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.800
Sorry. It's just, it's,
it's too much pressure.

670
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:34.968
Okay.

671
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.112
Well, you don't have
to worry about it

672
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:37.804
because it's just dinner.

673
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.723
She's probably come
to her senses.

674
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:47.772
Do you have to go to the bathroo

675
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.065
I'm Good.

676
00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:51.818
Are you gonna stand like that?

677
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.860
I'm good.

678
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.448
Hi.

679
00:26:56.489 --> 00:26:58.241
Thank you.

680
00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.492
Can I take your coat?

681
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:00.845
Um, can I leave that on for now?

682
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:02.346
Yeah, it's kind of cold.

683
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.498
My gosh. Your
hair looks so good.

684
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.416
I worked hard on it.

685
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.709
- Hi.
- Look at this.

686
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:08.585
Thank you so much.

687
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.878
- I love wine.
- So nice.

688
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.380
So, Wendy, what's up?

689
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.423
What's up?

690
00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.425
Just, just, just nervous.

691
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.385
- Yeah.
- Just really nervous.

692
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.095
I feel like I might have-

693
00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.056
Diarrhea, right?

694
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.311
Put on too much makeup
is what I was gonna say.

695
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.354
-No. -No.

696
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:28.438
- No?
- No.

697
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.790
- Okay.
- Your eyes look amazing.

698
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.191
Your skin.

699
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.859
You look so pretty.

700
00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:33.901
Thanks.

701
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:35.569
Um, so-

702
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:37.446
Um, Emma,

703
00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:42.535
I should say something in
the spirit of full disclosure.

704
00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:43.577
Um...

705
00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:49.417
When we first met, I...

706
00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:51.378
My goodness.

707
00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:52.730
I'm so scared of
what this might be.

708
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.482
It's nothing, it's
nothing, it's nothing.

709
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.298
Okay.

710
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.341
I just...

711
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:57.693
When we first met,
I kind of had a,

712
00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:58.802
a crush on you,

713
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:01.805
- a little.
- My gosh.

714
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:05.558
I mean, come on,

715
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.393
who wouldn't?

716
00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:08.144
You're so confident

717
00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.813
and funny

718
00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.897
and sexy.

719
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:12.899
Wow.

720
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.901
My goodness.

721
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:15.777
Thank you.

722
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.238
I mean, you're sexy too.

723
00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:25.495
I, I know we said we weren't
gonna have any expectations

724
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.247
about tonight.

725
00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.416
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah, so...

726
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:38.925
But I really, really
wanna fuck you.

727
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.553
Get her coat.

728
00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:42.137
Okay, I'm gonna take your coat.

729
00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:43.178
Thanks.

730
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.853
Let's get this off.

731
00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.396
There you go.

732
00:28:59.446 --> 00:29:00.739
My God.

733
00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:07.954
You smell so good.

734
00:29:10.123 --> 00:29:14.794
It's my moisturizer.

735
00:29:14.836 --> 00:29:15.962
It's from Costco.

736
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:24.053
Emma, you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

737
00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:28.850
Josh is cute too, right?

738
00:29:33.938 --> 00:29:35.058
Emma? -

739
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.693
Do I have consent to
go down on you?

740
00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:40.487
Yes.

741
00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:41.529
Yes?

742
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:50.997
Gosh.

743
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:07.347
No!

744
00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:11.141
Okay.

745
00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:13.393
So...

746
00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:19.526
So I'm, I'm just gonna
hang back a little bit here

747
00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:20.568
and, you,

748
00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:26.241
you just let me know when
would a good time would be.

749
00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:38.395
My God, I'm coming, I'm
coming, coming, coming.

750
00:30:38.419 --> 00:30:39.420
No, no, no.

751
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.479
I like the way you

752
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.399
I don't know what happened.

753
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.485
She, she just got
really intense.

754
00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.945
Yeah, super intense.

755
00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:06.072
I knew this was a bad idea.

756
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.383
You knew it was a bad idea?

757
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:08.199
What, is it my fault?

758
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.033
It's not my fault.

759
00:31:09.075 --> 00:31:09.868
No, no, no, no.

760
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:11.536
Of course not. No.

761
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:12.912
Well, I mean, it seemed like it,

762
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.557
it was promising
at the beginning.

763
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:16.916
It seemed like, you know,

764
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.085
something was happening.

765
00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:21.421
It seemed like you were into it.

766
00:31:21.462 --> 00:31:22.338
Well, y...

767
00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:24.424
No, I mean, yeah, I wa, I was.

768
00:31:24.465 --> 00:31:25.901
I, I mean, 'cause, you
know, it was exciting.

769
00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:26.925
It was new, right?

770
00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:29.113
It was, it was, she was
very attractive and it was-

771
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.948
Yeah, she came to
the house in lingerie.

772
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.616
- Of course she's attractive.
- I know. I know.

773
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640
Okay.

774
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.311
So...

775
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.689
So, so what do we do now?

776
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.650
Try something else.

777
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.820
Just you do this
surprising this time.

778
00:31:45.862 --> 00:31:46.862
Okay.

779
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.530
Okay.

780
00:31:52.785 --> 00:31:54.078
Morning, lovely.

781
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.080
Morning.

782
00:32:14.307 --> 00:32:16.142
What's the
craziest thing, sexually,

783
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.435
that you've ever done?

784
00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:18.603
Craziest thing I ever did?

785
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:19.979
Yeah.

786
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:21.814
I fucked a dead girl once.

787
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.399
My God. Really?

788
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.819
No, but I would if
she was super hot.

789
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.154
You know what? Forget it.

790
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.196
I'm sorry I asked.

791
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.158
And I went to a
swingers' party one time.

792
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.410
Everyone was having
sex everywhere.

793
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.954
Yeah, it was dirty.

794
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:37.163
Sexy, though.

795
00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:38.205
Skeevy.

796
00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040
Nasty.

797
00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:45.880
Nasty Lounge?

798
00:32:45.922 --> 00:32:47.173
Yeah.

799
00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.341
It's clever, right?

800
00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:51.010
I think it's, it's like
tongue in cheek.

801
00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:52.052
It's gross.

802
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.640
This whole thing is gross.

803
00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:57.684
Is there really nowhere else

804
00:32:57.725 --> 00:32:58.518
- we could go?
- Babe, babe,

805
00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.703
it's not like going for dim sum.

806
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.205
Okay? There's not a
lot of choice here.

807
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.981
There's one sex club.

808
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:03.815
This is it.

809
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:04.732
Come on, let's go.

810
00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:06.067
This will be fun.

811
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:12.967
So you, you don't
have like a daily,

812
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.201
like a guest pass available?

813
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:16.035
Okay.

814
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.161
Okay then.

815
00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:19.414
I guess, um, two one
year memberships.

816
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.166
Okay.

817
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:24.293
That'll be $300 each,

818
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.171
plus a one-time
initiation fee of $50.

819
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:30.883
And there's a mandatory
$27 coat-check fee charge,

820
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:31.968
and, of course,

821
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:32.802
- the cover charge.
- You know what?

822
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.137
I, I, I don't need to know.

823
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.346
Just, run, run that.

824
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:36.556
What, whatever you need.

825
00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:37.597
It's fine.

826
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.038
Could be worse.

827
00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.289
Yeah. No, no, no.

828
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.625
I think, I think this
looks promising.

829
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:24.771
Ex, excuse me.

830
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.900
Hi.

831
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.777
We're very flattered, um,

832
00:34:32.027 --> 00:34:33.905
but we're, we're not interested.

833
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:35.364
It's not, it's not you guys.

834
00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:37.199
We'd like some cheese.

835
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:39.744
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course.

836
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.788
Help, help yourself.

837
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:44.706
He just wanted some cheese.

838
00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:45.748
My God.

839
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:47.793
- Okay.
- Maybe we should-

840
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:48.835
No, no.

841
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:50.922
So what are you two beautiful
people drinking tonight?

842
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:53.132
-My God. -Finally.

843
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.467
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

844
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.967
Thank you for breaking the ice.

845
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.637
We're a little nervous.

846
00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:59.097
It's our first time.

847
00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:01.599
You've never ordered
a drink before?

848
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:03.518
Don't worry, we
could take it slow.

849
00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.186
Ha. Thank you.

850
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.705
I'll have a tomato
juice, please.

851
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:07.647
Yeah, me too.

852
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:08.648
Cool.

853
00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:10.233
Here's a tip.

854
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:14.779
Um, find the red curtain
for the higher end members.

855
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.073
I think you might get in.

856
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.032
- Thank you.
- The red...

857
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:19.408
- A red curtain.
- Red curtain.

858
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:22.745
I think that
looks like a red curtain.

859
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.997
That's definitely red curtain.

860
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:26.707
Higher end.

861
00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:28.435
Should we tell her to bring
the tomato juice in there?

862
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.459
Is that...

863
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.688
I mean, I'd feel bad if
we run into her later

864
00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:32.588
and she's been carrying
it around night.

865
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.339
She knows we're high end.

866
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.674
What would we say to her?

867
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.759
Tell her, sorry,

868
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.261
"Our marriage is failing

869
00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:41.472
and the only way to save
it is to rekindle our sex life

870
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.516
by getting our tomato juice
in the high end room."

871
00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.817
- My God.
- Where?

872
00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:59.407
That's, hey.

873
00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:08.016
The important thing
is to remember to have fun.

874
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.792
Do you hear that voice?

875
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:10.853
- She's over there.
- It's so familiar.

876
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:11.961
All ready for you.

877
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:12.837
There you go.

878
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:13.921
Just take your time.

879
00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.298
Have fun.

880
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.424
My God. My God.

881
00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.341
We need to go now.

882
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:18.009
- What?
- We need to leave now.

883
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.885
Why?

884
00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:19.802
Because-

885
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.053
Emma?

886
00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.516
No.

887
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:26.559
I-

888
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.227
No.

889
00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.564
I, I didn't see your name
on any of the newsletters.

890
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:32.440
Hey, Arthur.

891
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:34.066
-Hey, Josh. -Hi.

892
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.335
Hey, have you heard
from the girls?

893
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.903
Are they, are they
having fun at camp?

894
00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:38.362
Nope, we haven't heard a peep.

895
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.484
But you know what they say.

896
00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:40.823
When they're at camp,
no news is good news.

897
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.491
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:45.411
Um, are they taking
the bus home or are,

899
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.829
are you gonna pick them up?

900
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.415
You know, I think picking
up is probably the best.

901
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.559
It's part of the experience.

902
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:53.085
-Dad! What-
-Trust me.

903
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:56.005
I am way more
embarrassed than you are.

904
00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.506
What makes you assume that?

905
00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.300
Well, for one thing,

906
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.679
this isn't real leather 'cause
you know how it s, stains.

907
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.097
It's really hard to...

908
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:08.392
So, um, I had to use
vinyl and it,

909
00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:11.479
just doesn't work with
my, character.

910
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:13.189
Does Mom know?

911
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.774
- God.
- Does she?

912
00:37:14.815 --> 00:37:17.818
Arthur, Arthur, hey, this
is none of our business.

913
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.154
Okay, we're, we're not, we're
not gonna say a word to,

914
00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.030
to Marge.

915
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:21.864
We promise.

916
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:22.740
Go ahead.

917
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:23.782
She's right over there.

918
00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:27.703
My God.

919
00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.789
This is not happening.

920
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:30.957
This is not happening.

921
00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:34.126
Well, I g, I guess now
you know, um,

922
00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:38.673
what we were doing when we
said we were playing Bridge

923
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:40.716
with the Wassermans.

924
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:41.926
To tell you the truth,

925
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.278
we haven't actually seen
them since the '80s.

926
00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:45.137
My God. Dad!

927
00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:46.764
Why are you acting so casual?

928
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:50.268
Is this not the most mortifying
experience of your life?

929
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:52.812
I've had worse.

930
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:54.230
- Worse?
- Yeah.

931
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:58.651
I don't know how we're
ever gonna talk again.

932
00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:01.112
What, am I gonna come
over and bring the kids

933
00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:03.322
- and have lunch?
- What?

934
00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:04.573
This is it. This is...

935
00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:05.992
We have to part ways.

936
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:09.120
Just hang on there,
Judgey Judgerton.

937
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:11.497
You've seen me naked
millions of times.

938
00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:12.832
Not since I was six.

939
00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:14.834
Emma, can we please talk?

940
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:15.751
Please, please?

941
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.795
Please, please.

942
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:18.713
Hi.

943
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:19.964
My God, Wendy,

944
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.108
-what are you-
-I have not stopped

945
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.425
thinking about last night.

946
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.801
Okay, I don't know

947
00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:25.323
- what you think happened.
- The fuck?

948
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.447
But something happened and
we need to talk about it alone,

949
00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.222
- just you and me.
- Wendy,

950
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:29.307
what's going on with you?

951
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:30.099
What are you doing here?

952
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:32.310
It's a Giraffe.

953
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:34.270
Don't, don't be Tom.

954
00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:35.187
Don't be Tom.

955
00:38:35.229 --> 00:38:36.314
Tom!

956
00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:37.916
Are you serious that
you followed me here?

957
00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:39.025
That isn't a...

958
00:38:39.066 --> 00:38:40.735
That is a blatant
violation of privacy.

959
00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:41.819
I'm sorry.

960
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.046
Didn't you follow us
here, Wendy?

961
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:44.196
I followed Emma.

962
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:45.156
I'm sorry.

963
00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:46.324
Is this your new girlfriend?

964
00:38:46.365 --> 00:38:47.843
The one who stole
you away from me?

965
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:48.969
- Wait. Time out.
- She doesn't even

966
00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.953
- have a penis.
- I didn't steal anyone.

967
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.163
I'm not her girlfriend.

968
00:38:52.204 --> 00:38:53.204
We broke up weeks ago.

969
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.893
And I told you I'm free to fornicate
with whomever I choose.

970
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:58.210
Okay, wait.

971
00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:59.378
This is the guy?

972
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.129
-Don't put your finger-
-This the one

973
00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:00.796
you had a threesome with?

974
00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:01.630
Whoa! No!

975
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.672
Excuse me.

976
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:04.467
We didn't even touch
each other, that...

977
00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:05.343
I swear to God, that was not...

978
00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:06.802
You watched?

979
00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:08.488
I'm gonna use my thumbs
to crush your eyes

980
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.889
into their sockets!

981
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:10.890
No!

982
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.516
You back away from her.

983
00:39:12.558 --> 00:39:13.558
Bubbles.

984
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:17.229
My God.

985
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.147
Go, get out of here.

986
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.023
Go, go.

987
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.566
Emma?

988
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:27.948
What was that?

989
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.451
No, that was, that was crazy.

990
00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:32.286
That was my Dad!

991
00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:33.454
Yeah, I know. I know.

992
00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:34.973
Did you pick up on
what he was saying

993
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:37.792
about us going up to camp
on Sunday to pick up the girls?

994
00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.686
He's planning a surprise
anniversary party for us.

995
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.586
- I know he is.
- Josh-

996
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:41.462
I know he is.

997
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.964
We had issues before,

998
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:46.300
but I don't know how
we're gonna process this.

999
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:47.301
Your Dad? No.

1000
00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.177
Listen, it's...

1001
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.219
I think it's good.

1002
00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.573
Your mom and dad have
an active sex life

1003
00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:51.931
- after all these years.
- And what have we done to Wendy?

1004
00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:52.973
We didn't...

1005
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:53.682
Wait, that's...

1006
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.101
Is that our fault?

1007
00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:56.936
I mean, she was a
relatively normal person

1008
00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:58.229
before last night.

1009
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.706
I just know before we
ran into your parents,

1010
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.941
I think things were,
were going okay, right?

1011
00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:03.275
There was stuff happening there.

1012
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:05.069
Don't, don't you see?

1013
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.238
Our plans keep getting
messed up by external forces.

1014
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.406
Last night it was Wendy,

1015
00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:10.282
tonight it was your dad.

1016
00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:12.284
We need something
that's just us.

1017
00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:13.452
Yes. Yes.

1018
00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:14.721
- Something private, right?
- Yeah.

1019
00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.455
Like, intimate.

1020
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:17.497
Yeah.

1021
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.544
Maybe we should do ecstasy.

1022
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.130
Yeah.

1023
00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:25.256
Right.

1024
00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:26.650
'Cause I'm so great
with the drugs.

1025
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.485
You know, I get all
in my head and I...

1026
00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:29.509
it messes with me.

1027
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:31.947
And there was the time
when we took the mushrooms

1028
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:32.930
when we were camping
at Rolling River and I,

1029
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.765
I got poison Ivy on my butt.

1030
00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:36.934
Yeah, because you
took off all your clothes

1031
00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:38.644
and you ran through
the forest naked.

1032
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.813
It was very freeing.

1033
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.124
Well, I don't wanna be free.

1034
00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:43.333
I don't ever wanna
leave the house again

1035
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:44.357
after what I saw tonight.

1036
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.151
Okay.

1037
00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:50.322
Okay. Let's, let's
try the ecstasy.

1038
00:40:53.075 --> 00:40:55.202
Do you know where
to get the ecstasy?

1039
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:59.123
Like, where do you even-

1040
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:01.709
Like, at rave parties?

1041
00:41:02.877 --> 00:41:04.003
Let you into a rave party?

1042
00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:05.044
Like, a dark alley.

1043
00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:07.274
You're gonna have to get
it in an alley in the dark.

1044
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.507
I got this.

1045
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.181
How do you got it?

1046
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:16.015
I got it.

1047
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:16.974
No, you don't.

1048
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:17.850
I got this.

1049
00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:20.186
Okay.

1050
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.198
Hey, yo, yo, you.

1051
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:33.616
You look shifty.

1052
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.950
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1053
00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.243
What do you want?

1054
00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:40.348
I was wondering if, if
you could,

1055
00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:42.666
score me some ec, ecs...

1056
00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:43.834
Are you a narc?

1057
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.211
What?

1058
00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:47.505
You sound like a really
bad narc from the '90s.

1059
00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:48.422
Why?

1060
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:50.883
Did, did I, did I say it wrong?

1061
00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:55.554
Whatever.

1062
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:56.972
Can you hook me up?

1063
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:01.769
What makes you think I have it?

1064
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.020
What, I don't...

1065
00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.188
No, I don't know.

1066
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.415
'Cause you, you're
like a young person.

1067
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:06.232
You're like a, like a,

1068
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.943
like a modern woman and you,

1069
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.403
you like to have a good time.

1070
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:12.863
What?

1071
00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.174
So you think I just
carry around MDMA

1072
00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:17.535
on my person at work
on a Thursday?

1073
00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.412
God, no.

1074
00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:21.539
Ooh, fuck!

1075
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.373
When you say it like that,

1076
00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:23.666
I realize it was stupid.

1077
00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.750
I'm an idiot.

1078
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:27.253
I'm sorry, forget it.

1079
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.882
So what...

1080
00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:32.925
So all that then was,

1081
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:34.069
that was just you
busting my balls,

1082
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.261
like you torturing me

1083
00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:36.262
- for your amusement?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1084
00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:37.930
Your eyeballs were twitching.

1085
00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:40.015
It was gross, but
I kinda liked it.

1086
00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.350
Bye, Natasha.

1087
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.392
Bye, Keanu.

1088
00:42:44.186 --> 00:42:45.771
Okay.

1089
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:47.731
Shading.

1090
00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:49.000
-Shading. -Yeah.

1091
00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:50.192
See tomorrow.

1092
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:55.281
I'm sad because you said
you'd come by the gallery

1093
00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:56.240
and you never came.

1094
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:57.575
Shit.

1095
00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:59.159
Okay, I'm sorry.

1096
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:00.804
I just, things have
been kind of crazy with-

1097
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.079
Okay, that's enough small talk.

1098
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:03.747
I mostly came back for these.

1099
00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:07.167
I want these in my gallery now.

1100
00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:09.169
The artist I was showing
came by the gallery today

1101
00:43:09.211 --> 00:43:12.006
and saw that I, I took
down his scrotums.

1102
00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:13.775
He wasn't happy so
he pulled everything,

1103
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.175
now my gallery's empty.

1104
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:16.653
I desperately need
something to show.

1105
00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:17.595
I...

1106
00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:18.429
You'd be saving my ass.

1107
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.389
Wait, are you kidding?

1108
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.557
You're serious?

1109
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:24.977
I, I mean, this is incredible.

1110
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.479
I, I'd have to check
with the Aisha,

1111
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:29.231
but I'm sure she'd be thrilled.

1112
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.608
Yes.

1113
00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:31.649
My God.

1114
00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.170
You have no idea what kind of
impact this could have on her.

1115
00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:35.194
Okay.

1116
00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.299
We'll bring them by tomorrow

1117
00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:40.075
and I'll use as
many as I can fit.

1118
00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.785
You're serious?

1119
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:42.827
My God.

1120
00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:45.497
Hello.

1121
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.999
Yeah, no, I, I understand.

1122
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.917
I had a, an epiphany, though.

1123
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.377
Open Saturday.

1124
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.462
No, no balls.

1125
00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:52.546
She's a child.

1126
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.885
Is all the water
really necessary?

1127
00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:58.802
Well, yeah,

1128
00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.012
if you don't want to die

1129
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.014
because I read that
most MDMA related deaths

1130
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.349
are caused by dehydration.

1131
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.184
So if we're all splayed
out on the floor,

1132
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:06.352
all whacked out on drugs,

1133
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:07.227
and we can't make it to the-

1134
00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:08.228
You're kind of ruining the fun.

1135
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.021
Okay, fine.

1136
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.022
Okay.

1137
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.148
Okay.

1138
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.190
Sorry.

1139
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:15.819
There, you see that?

1140
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:17.071
You see how quickly I forgot

1141
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.197
everything that I've read

1142
00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:20.407
about how ecstasy
depletes spinal fluid

1143
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:21.158
and increases the-

1144
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.200
Shh.

1145
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:26.746
Thank you.

1146
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.375
All right.

1147
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:30.668
Here, here. Cheers.

1148
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.462
Cheers.

1149
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.504
Good luck.

1150
00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:37.383
Shit. Water.

1151
00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:50.437
How about now?

1152
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:53.857
Yeah, yeah, no, I think I'm,

1153
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:54.900
I'm feeling som...

1154
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.419
I'm starting to feel
something, you?

1155
00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:58.862
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I feel something.

1156
00:44:58.904 --> 00:44:59.780
I think it's working.

1157
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:00.822
Yeah.

1158
00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:05.619
Can you believe we thought
that was it back on the couch?

1159
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.537
My gosh.

1160
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:07.413
I feel like we're...

1161
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:08.473
We were not high at the house.

1162
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:09.456
God.

1163
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.834
And this whole sex thing.

1164
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:14.670
I mean, we, we feel fine.

1165
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:16.004
We'll figure it out.

1166
00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.005
We're not gonna
like sell our house

1167
00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:18.257
and traumatize our kids.

1168
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:19.859
- My God.
- We're not gonna wake up and,

1169
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.427
like, hate each other.

1170
00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:22.553
That's not who we are.

1171
00:45:22.594 --> 00:45:23.822
God, I feel really
good right now.

1172
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:24.680
We're so good
at figuring things out.

1173
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:25.722
-I feel-
-Like, I know.

1174
00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.826
I feel like I could do anything.

1175
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:28.976
My God.

1176
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:29.685
- Whoa!
- I feel like

1177
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.019
we could do anything.

1178
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.373
-I feel like everything's,
alive -You know what?

1179
00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.442
We just made everything so
unnecessarily complicated.

1180
00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.628
Don't you feel like we're too
serious about the sex stuff?

1181
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.088
When we were in
university, we just had...

1182
00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.112
We fucked everywhere.

1183
00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:42.740
- We, like, had sex in my car.
- And my parents!

1184
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:43.781
My God, my parents-

1185
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:46.452
Or when they were sleeping.

1186
00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:47.762
We'd pretend you
were a girl guide

1187
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:49.246
and that I was a hunter-

1188
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.624
Yeah, and the kissing.

1189
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:53.768
Yeah, we kissed all the time.

1190
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:55.210
God, and your dick.

1191
00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.628
You, I used to love-

1192
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.130
You always said you
enjoyed my penis.

1193
00:45:58.172 --> 00:45:59.423
Even though it wasn't huge.

1194
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.425
I, I have a slim vagina, right?

1195
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.468
You have the slimmest-

1196
00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:04.094
You have the slimmest vagina

1197
00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:05.136
of anyone I've ever seen.

1198
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:06.948
I know, it was a perfect fit.

1199
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:08.408
It was like puzzle
pieces that fit together.

1200
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.224
I wanna kiss you.

1201
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.434
I wanna kiss you.

1202
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.437
My God.

1203
00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.271
My God, your tongue-

1204
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.898
It's my winter mint gum.

1205
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.037
What?

1206
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:33.081
Are you done?

1207
00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:34.082
I can't believe I just did that.

1208
00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.124
My God.

1209
00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:44.509
It's okay.

1210
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.655
We could just recharge
the batteries.

1211
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.181
No, like, I...

1212
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:50.700
Everything I read
said, you know,

1213
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:52.494
there's erectile
dysfunction issues on ectasy.

1214
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:53.870
I mean, we were lucky
to get one erection.

1215
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:55.354
We're, we're not gonna get two.

1216
00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:56.313
I'm sure we can try.

1217
00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.523
No, please don't do that.

1218
00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.000
- Please don't, don't, don't.
- Okay, sorry.

1219
00:46:59.024 --> 00:46:59.983
Just don't.

1220
00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:00.776
Just don't think about it.

1221
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:01.610
Just...

1222
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.861
I'll, I'll wait.

1223
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:07.616
It's fine.

1224
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.742
I'm really sorry.

1225
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.369
No. Please don't apologize.

1226
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.410
Really?

1227
00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:14.915
So you're not, like, totally
frustrated right now.

1228
00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:16.375
No.

1229
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.001
I mean, I'm a little frustrated.

1230
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:18.961
My God, you are frustrated.

1231
00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:19.837
I knew, I knew this.

1232
00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:21.547
I fucked the whole thing up.

1233
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.591
We can still do this.

1234
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.110
No that's, that's pressuring
me. You're...

1235
00:47:26.134 --> 00:47:27.344
That's putting pressure on me,

1236
00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.822
and I don't function
well under pressure.

1237
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:29.846
You know I, I don't-

1238
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.891
I can't stop thinking about
that comment you made earlier

1239
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:33.933
about my penis.

1240
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.728
When I complimented it?

1241
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.856
By calling it not huge.

1242
00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:39.731
My God.

1243
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:40.834
What? -No, no.

1244
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:41.692
- I'm leaking.
- What?

1245
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:44.570
I'm leaking spinal fluid.

1246
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:45.821
It's semen.

1247
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:46.864
I don't feel right.

1248
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:48.198
It's not spinal fluid.

1249
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.032
I don't, I, I, I...

1250
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:50.242
My head hurts and I, I,

1251
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.594
I'm having, like,
fucking back spasms.

1252
00:47:51.618 --> 00:47:53.036
Okay. Can you just calm down?

1253
00:47:53.078 --> 00:47:55.098
We're not the couple that
yells at each other, okay?

1254
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.081
Right.

1255
00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:57.249
Just calm down.

1256
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.877
When we have a
problem, we fix it.

1257
00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:01.795
- Yeah.
- Or we compromise.

1258
00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:04.590
I know what that is.

1259
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:06.025
I know what, I know
what you're doing there.

1260
00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.777
If you wanna say
something, just say it to me.

1261
00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.153
And when you say that,
it's like you're saying...

1262
00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:10.217
I know what you're saying.

1263
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:11.638
It's like you think that
you're the only one of us

1264
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.347
who compromises.

1265
00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.265
That's not what I meant.

1266
00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:14.725
Okay?

1267
00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:17.060
But maybe we should
stop playing games.

1268
00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:19.438
Maybe we should
just speak our mind.

1269
00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:20.439
Great, you want me
to speak my mind,

1270
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.480
fuck I'ma speak my mind.

1271
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.025
Calmly!

1272
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.109
I'm gonna speak my f...

1273
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.004
My I'm losing fucking
my mind, Em.

1274
00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.322
I'm losing it because
the kids are coming home

1275
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:30.324
from camp and then,

1276
00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:33.285
then we're, we're back to,
like, our normal routine.

1277
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.746
And then, then this was
our one chance, you know,

1278
00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:37.956
our one chance to prove
that we could do this,

1279
00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.434
that we're not, I don't
know, what, like,

1280
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:40.768
sexually incompatible
or something.

1281
00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:42.669
You think I'm not terrified?

1282
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:44.796
You think I'm not
lying in bed at night

1283
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:46.632
worried about why
we're not fucking,

1284
00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:48.926
that we're gonna end up
like Andrew and Janice

1285
00:48:48.967 --> 00:48:50.802
in the goddamn grocery store?

1286
00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.056
You think this is just you?

1287
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.686
Do you not see that my heart

1288
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.399
is breaking just a little
more every single day?

1289
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.574
We're great parents
together, right?

1290
00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:15.535
And we, we got the
friendship thing down.

1291
00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:16.578
It's just...

1292
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.331
It's this one piece that we...

1293
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.791
I don't know.

1294
00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:23.794
I mean, I think maybe
we made a mistake.

1295
00:49:28.548 --> 00:49:30.425
Yeah, maybe we did.

1296
00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.678
- Yep.
- Wait, what are you...

1297
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:34.638
What are you doing?

1298
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.616
What, what are you,
what are you doing?

1299
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.432
I don't know.

1300
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.474
I just gotta

1301
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.395
clear my head,

1302
00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:42.187
get my thoughts together.

1303
00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.271
I'm gonna go to a hotel.

1304
00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.398
You're gon-

1305
00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:45.273
What are...

1306
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.692
You're gonna what? Wh, why, why?

1307
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.193
Why? Why?

1308
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:49.194
I don't know.

1309
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.028
I don't know what
the fuck to do.

1310
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.904
I don't know.

1311
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:52.066
I don't think we're gonna...

1312
00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:54.074
I don't think we're gonna
get anywhere here tonight

1313
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:56.368
with both of us

1314
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:01.748
just confused and paranoid.

1315
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.625
Paran, paranoid?

1316
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.543
Is that what you think?

1317
00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:05.377
You're talking about me, right?

1318
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:06.562
You said we, but you meant me.

1319
00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:07.462
You think that I'm
being paranoid?

1320
00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.506
Is that what you're saying?

1321
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.049
Please don't go, okay?

1322
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:12.217
There was a mis...

1323
00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.553
We, we're not the
couple that does that.

1324
00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:16.138
We don't, like, walk
out on each other

1325
00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:16.888
in the middle of a fight.

1326
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.056
No, we're not, we're not,

1327
00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:19.975
we're not the couple
who invites their friend

1328
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.560
to a fucking threesome.

1329
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:25.063
And we're not the couple
who take ecstasy

1330
00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:26.481
- to try and have sex.
- I know.

1331
00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:29.901
Or have crushes on people

1332
00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:32.404
the week we're supposed to have-

1333
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:34.239
- Wait.
- You know, like,

1334
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:36.033
- to have sex.
- I'm sorry.

1335
00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:38.201
Did you just say cru,
that we have crushes?

1336
00:50:38.243 --> 00:50:39.243
I'm, I don't...

1337
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.079
-I'm, I don't, I don't-
-No, it's nothing.

1338
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.248
It's just a stupid
fucking crush.

1339
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.752
It's just this timing that
obviously is saying something.

1340
00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.795
It's just freaking me out.

1341
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:51.131
Whoa.

1342
00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:52.174
Who is it?

1343
00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.220
It's Marlon.

1344
00:50:57.262 --> 00:50:58.430
Marlon?

1345
00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.265
Marlon from art school?

1346
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:01.725
Marlon, the gallery thingy guy?

1347
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.393
Yes. It's stupid.

1348
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.936
Okay.

1349
00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:05.771
So what?

1350
00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:07.606
You guys, all week,

1351
00:51:07.647 --> 00:51:10.025
you guys have been,
like, flirting and stuff?

1352
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:11.860
No.

1353
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.902
I mean,

1354
00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:14.904
a little,

1355
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:17.949
maybe.

1356
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.618
Okay.

1357
00:51:19.659 --> 00:51:21.203
Can I get some details on that,

1358
00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.623
just, like, details about
what that means?

1359
00:51:24.664 --> 00:51:26.958
No, 'cause that's
a really bad idea.

1360
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.311
I think it's actually
a really good idea

1361
00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:29.211
'cause I need to hear it.

1362
00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.545
And you just said

1363
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.981
- you have a crush on Marlon.
- Well, I don't know

1364
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:32.756
what you're gonna hear
'cause there's also no details.

1365
00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:33.632
- I had-
-Okay.

1366
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:34.633
- You want the details?
- Yes.

1367
00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:38.512
I had a, a daydream about him.

1368
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:41.014
- A daydream?
- That's it.

1369
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.766
Is that like...

1370
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:45.769
Is that code for, like,
a sex fantasy?

1371
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.315
Yeah, I guess.

1372
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:51.608
I guess that's what it is.

1373
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.877
Wow. - Yeah.

1374
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:53.985
Wow. Okay.

1375
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.320
-So... Now you know.

1376
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:58.740
In this, like, fantasy
did he, like, kiss you?

1377
00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:01.952
In the fantasy?

1378
00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:03.846
Yeah, inside the
fantasy, did he kiss you?

1379
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.123
- Yes. He did.
- Wow.

1380
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.165
Right.

1381
00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:08.750
Like, was it like a very...

1382
00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:12.003
Like a, tonguey, hot kiss?

1383
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:15.006
Well, it was in a fantasy,

1384
00:52:15.048 --> 00:52:16.842
- so it was like a-
-Yeah.

1385
00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:18.163
- You know-
-It's probably-

1386
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.594
-My fantasy... Yeah,
your fantasy kiss.

1387
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:20.679
It was a pretty hot kiss.

1388
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.638
With Marlon.

1389
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.514
And what else did he do to,

1390
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:25.183
did he do to you in the fantasy?

1391
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:26.369
I don't think you really
wanna know this.

1392
00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:27.853
No, I definitely wanna know.

1393
00:52:27.894 --> 00:52:28.645
And I want you to tell me.

1394
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:29.437
I just want to know.

1395
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.689
It's cool.

1396
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:31.690
Just tell me what he did
to you in the fantasy.

1397
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:32.792
What he did to me
in the fantasy-

1398
00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:33.936
- Yes, yeah.
- He,

1399
00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:38.321
he lifted me up on the desk
and he took my panties off.

1400
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.448
They were much
nicer... Okay.

1401
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.218
- No, you're right.
- Than I was actually wearing.

1402
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.636
- You're right.
- And then he came

1403
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.578
-and he-
-That's good.

1404
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:45.495
Stop it!

1405
00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:46.329
It's good, it's good.

1406
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.205
I get it. You're right.

1407
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:48.790
That was a really bad idea.

1408
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.041
And,

1409
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.588
and you were right

1410
00:52:54.629 --> 00:52:56.190
that we are not gonna
figure this out tonight.

1411
00:52:56.214 --> 00:52:57.924
-Josh. -No.

1412
00:52:57.966 --> 00:52:59.766
And you were right that
we need space, so I'm-

1413
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.677
My God.

1414
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:01.887
I'm giving us some space.

1415
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.638
Where are you going?

1416
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.890
Josh?

1417
00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:17.903
Fucking gnomes!

1418
00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:49.558
Dude.

1419
00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:53.146
You partied on a school
night, wow.

1420
00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:56.107
You look really creepy.

1421
00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:57.442
You look super fucking sketchy.

1422
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.003
It's, it's actually
really embarrassing.

1423
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:02.113
Hey, Josh, I need you to
clean that up and go home.

1424
00:54:04.115 --> 00:54:06.409
Yeah, well, there it is,

1425
00:54:06.826 --> 00:54:09.246
the fog of the morning after.

1426
00:54:09.287 --> 00:54:10.747
You know, I should
have warned you.

1427
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.892
That's what happens when you
have an evening of euphoria

1428
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:13.959
and crazy sex.

1429
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:16.938
Would you, would you
stop with the sex?

1430
00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:18.630
There was no sex, okay?

1431
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.672
Emma and I,

1432
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:21.984
we took the ectasy
because our relationship

1433
00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:23.527
is falling apart because
our sex life is in shambles.

1434
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.344
All right?

1435
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:26.388
There, I said it.

1436
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.642
Okay.

1437
00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.978
Well, first of all,
it's called "molly".

1438
00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:34.229
When you say the ecstasy,

1439
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:36.064
it's very embarrassing
for both of us.

1440
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.816
And I'm guessing it's
still in your system

1441
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:38.918
'cause it's doing something

1442
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:42.237
that was surprisingly, honest.

1443
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:43.279
I'm sorry.

1444
00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:45.837
Come on, tell me what
happened last night.

1445
00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.744
Okay.

1446
00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.414
It was, it was really bad.

1447
00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.455
It was a disaster.

1448
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:56.352
She told me that she has a
crush on this old flame of hers.

1449
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:57.168
Okay.

1450
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.211
That's totally normal.

1451
00:54:58.253 --> 00:54:59.629
People have crushes
all the time.

1452
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:00.982
Yeah, but she's been
working with the guy all week

1453
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.191
and now she's worried that
she's gonna maybe, like,

1454
00:55:02.215 --> 00:55:04.676
do it with him or something.

1455
00:55:05.885 --> 00:55:07.445
I spent the night at a
dingy motel room.

1456
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.014
Yeah.

1457
00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:10.390
That's pretty fucking tragic.

1458
00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:11.474
Yeah.

1459
00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:13.685
It's the first time
since I met her

1460
00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:16.563
that I just have no clue
what's going on in her head.

1461
00:55:16.604 --> 00:55:17.604
Yeah.

1462
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:21.359
Well, you should probably
do something about that.

1463
00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:22.861
I know.

1464
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:24.862
That, that, that's
what I was thinking.

1465
00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:26.132
Yeah, maybe like a romantic
gesture or something.

1466
00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.533
Hey, you, you think I
should make her jealous?

1467
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:30.553
No, I don't think
you should do that.

1468
00:55:30.577 --> 00:55:32.054
Yeah, because she's
never been jealous before.

1469
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:33.347
She's not really
the jealous type,

1470
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:34.890
that's just because I've
never posed a threat.

1471
00:55:34.914 --> 00:55:36.392
Okay, what you're
suggesting is juvenile,

1472
00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:38.209
manipulative and mean-spirited.

1473
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:39.044
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1474
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:40.045
It's gonna work.

1475
00:55:40.086 --> 00:55:41.546
No, look, I happen
to be a master

1476
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:43.173
at romantic manipulation, okay?

1477
00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:44.049
I am not proud of it.

1478
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.192
My God, I am so proud of it.

1479
00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:46.301
I'm just kidding.

1480
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.010
-And what is... I
know what I'm saying

1481
00:55:47.052 --> 00:55:48.052
sounds totally crazy.

1482
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:49.989
I recognize this is an
unconventional approach.

1483
00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:50.972
It sounds crazy coming
outta my mouth.

1484
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.199
What are you doing
with that phone?

1485
00:55:52.223 --> 00:55:53.743
But I really think thi,
this is gonna work

1486
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.477
because I feel her
slipping away, you know?

1487
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.204
And I gotta do whatever it
takes to get her back, right?

1488
00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:58.146
It doesn't make me a bad per...

1489
00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.332
Does that make me a bad person?

1490
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:01.000
It doesn't make you a
bad... My God.

1491
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.067
Josh, Josh, listen to me!

1492
00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:04.361
Every single person
born after 1990

1493
00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:05.737
is trained in these very arts,

1494
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:06.738
the art of Tinder.

1495
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.614
Please just put the phone down.

1496
00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:08.490
Put it down.

1497
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.531
Hang up the phone.

1498
00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.119
I need you to do this for me.

1499
00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:14.412
What? No,

1500
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:15.413
I'm not touching that phone.

1501
00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:16.455
Nope.

1502
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:17.832
I think it looks really good.

1503
00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:18.874
Yeah.

1504
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:20.539
I'm sorry, just one second.

1505
00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.630
Thank God you called.

1506
00:56:23.671 --> 00:56:25.090
Look, I don't wanna-

1507
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.466
Hello?

1508
00:56:26.508 --> 00:56:27.801
Sorry.

1509
00:56:27.842 --> 00:56:29.302
Who is this?

1510
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:31.137
This is Emma.

1511
00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:32.472
Who's this?

1512
00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:33.306
Geez.

1513
00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:34.348
I'm so sorry.

1514
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.495
I think I might have ass
dialed you on Josh's phone.

1515
00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:38.603
Who is this?

1516
00:56:39.813 --> 00:56:42.607
It's Kelly from Josh's work.

1517
00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:44.692
Josh, my gosh, come here.

1518
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.587
I think I might have ass
dialed Emma on your phone.

1519
00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:48.613
I'm so sorry.

1520
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.698
I'm such a dumb slut sometimes.

1521
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.117
That's good. That's good.

1522
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:54.452
Hey, sorry about that.

1523
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.620
Hey.

1524
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:56.662
Um,

1525
00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:02.544
how are you feeling
after last night?

1526
00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.379
I don't know.

1527
00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:06.631
I've been better.

1528
00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.216
What I said about Marlon-

1529
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:11.052
Just, I, I really don't
wanna hear about Marlon

1530
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:11.636
- right now, okay?
- I know.

1531
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.012
I'm sorry.

1532
00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:14.281
-I... It was a mistake.

1533
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:15.408
I, I didn't mean to call you.

1534
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.933
I, I gotta go.

1535
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:17.975
Um,

1536
00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:21.187
we're just gonna go
grab some dinner.

1537
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:23.440
Okay.

1538
00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:25.692
You, you have dinner plans?

1539
00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:30.363
It's like a private work
thing, so...

1540
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:32.949
Anyway, I gotta go.

1541
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:33.991
Bye.

1542
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.831
Well, that's done.

1543
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:46.880
I feel dirty.

1544
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.925
What did I just do?

1545
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.528
I believe my words
were mean-spirited,

1546
00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:53.928
juvenile and manipulative.

1547
00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.930
How could you let me do that?

1548
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.308
I, I actually warned you.

1549
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:59.184
I have a gift.

1550
00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:00.286
It's guided by a higher power,

1551
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.110
there's nothing I
can do about it.

1552
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:04.731
The situation is 100% on you.

1553
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:14.782
Like, it's, it's looking
pretty good, right?

1554
00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:17.160
I mean, we can come
back tomorrow

1555
00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:19.096
and make some last minute
adjustments if we want to.

1556
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.996
But I don't know.

1557
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.706
I think we're pretty much...

1558
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.082
We're ready to go.

1559
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.337
You got any dinner plans?

1560
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:29.923
You know I'm married, right?

1561
00:58:29.964 --> 00:58:31.799
So what the fuck is
wrong with you?

1562
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.887
I, I, I thought the three of
us could grab some dinner,

1563
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:39.015
you, me and Josh, if you
don't already have plans,

1564
00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.809
But, really, forget it.

1565
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:44.062
- I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.
- No.

1566
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.855
You know what?

1567
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:47.374
I don't even want to
have dinner with you,

1568
00:58:47.398 --> 00:58:49.817
with either of you
'cause I, I hate dinner.

1569
00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.695
I totally was, was joking.

1570
00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:55.406
I don't even eat, so that's...

1571
00:58:55.448 --> 00:58:56.592
Whatever I did, I
didn't mean it.

1572
00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:57.575
I'm truly sorry.

1573
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.661
And please don't be mad at me.

1574
00:59:00.578 --> 00:59:01.746
No, it's not you.

1575
00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:04.582
I'm really sorry.

1576
00:59:04.624 --> 00:59:07.210
I just made everything
really awkward.

1577
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:10.004
Well, welcome to my world.

1578
00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:13.341
The, the world of
awkward, awkward world,

1579
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.093
the wonderful world of awkward.

1580
00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:16.177
Just stop.

1581
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.513
Look, Josh and I just have...

1582
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.157
We're just going through
something right now,

1583
00:59:20.181 --> 00:59:22.934
so we can't go for dinner.

1584
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.813
It's just we've always been
able to talk it through,

1585
00:59:26.854 --> 00:59:28.189
always.

1586
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:30.358
Yeah, I believe it.

1587
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.859
Are you gonna eat that?

1588
00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:34.779
And, but I, I s...

1589
00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:36.239
I screwed up.

1590
00:59:36.281 --> 00:59:38.324
I told him I had a crush.

1591
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.242
You have a crush?

1592
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:43.305
I told him I was having intense
sexual fantasies about you

1593
00:59:43.329 --> 00:59:46.124
when we were in an
ecstasy fueled meltdown

1594
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:49.168
teeming with paranoia
and anxiety.

1595
00:59:50.169 --> 00:59:52.964
I was just a horrible person,

1596
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:54.465
a stupid person.

1597
00:59:54.507 --> 00:59:56.718
Well, he's not exactly
being a saint, you know,

1598
00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.344
trying to make you jealous

1599
00:59:58.386 --> 01:00:01.806
with that phone call tonight
with that girl from work.

1600
01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.601
- Wait. Wait.
- Now, when you say fantasies-

1601
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:07.770
Wait, you think he was trying
to make me jealous, like,

1602
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:08.813
on purpose?

1603
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.273
Yeah.

1604
01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.750
It seemed pretty obvious
from what you were saying.

1605
01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.319
But when you say sexual,

1606
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.613
- what exactly are we doing?
- My God.

1607
01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.239
That is so unlike him.

1608
01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.492
That's...

1609
01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:24.162
I can't believe he
would do that.

1610
01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:28.958
I mean, that's something
I did in eighth grade

1611
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.793
when I was an idiot.

1612
01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:32.795
It's so mean.

1613
01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.590
My God.

1614
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.843
My God, am I...

1615
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.304
Is he an idiot?

1616
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.056
Am I married to an idiot?

1617
01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:44.867
Have I been married to
an idiot for like 10 years

1618
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.017
and didn't know it?

1619
01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.519
I mean, all's fair
and love and war,

1620
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.354
or so they say.

1621
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:50.355
I mean, I,

1622
01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.816
I personally don't
advocate for, um,

1623
01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:54.692
-idiocy in-
-How could-

1624
01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.653
In love or, or, or-

1625
01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.071
I mean, I don't know

1626
01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.406
how I could have not
seen that, though.

1627
01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.785
You could fight fire with
fire, you know,

1628
01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.454
make him jealous too.

1629
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580
My...

1630
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:11.917
I'll be, I'll be back.

1631
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.130
Hey, was I wearing anything
specific in the, in the..

1632
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.884
It's a blessing and a cruse.

1633
01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.570
But, you know, I'm
just so good at it.

1634
01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.012
I look so cute doing it.

1635
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.305
- Yeah.
- Shit.

1636
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.347
She looks pissed.

1637
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.850
Okay. Well, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna hang back.

1638
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.561
Honey, look, I know that-

1639
01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.065
You just, you slapped me?

1640
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.483
It was with a mitten.

1641
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.026
What is wrong with you,

1642
01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.820
trying to make me jealous?

1643
01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:40.405
Is that...

1644
01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:41.447
That's what we are now?

1645
01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.889
-No, look, look-
-Like 12-year-olds?

1646
01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:44.867
I regressed, I did
something stupid,

1647
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:45.909
I know that.

1648
01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:47.537
But it's 'cause I'm out
of my mind and I,

1649
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:48.121
I didn't know what to do.

1650
01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:49.122
But don't you see?

1651
01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:50.623
You saw through that bullshit.

1652
01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.934
You're, you know me
better than anybody.

1653
01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:52.750
You saw right through it.

1654
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:53.710
- You still came.
- No.

1655
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.961
I, I didn't.

1656
01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.422
I never would've known
if Marlon didn't say

1657
01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.799
that you were doing
this stupid thing.

1658
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:00.883
Marlon?

1659
01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:02.760
So what, you...

1660
01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.804
So you were just
with Marlon now?

1661
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.265
I was at the gallery
setting up for the show.

1662
01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:08.266
You know, don't turn this into-

1663
01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.392
Hold on. I'm just trying...

1664
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.661
I'm just trying, I'm
trying to understand

1665
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.365
how that conversation
must have played out.

1666
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.956
So you would've had to have
like told him about our issues,

1667
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.315
about our private,
personal sexual issues.

1668
01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:19.193
We were having dinner.

1669
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.278
I was upset.

1670
01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.863
I had to talk to somebody.

1671
01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.406
I see.

1672
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:24.866
I get, I get what this is.

1673
01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.907
You,

1674
01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.870
you...

1675
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.246
I made you jealous

1676
01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.390
and so now you're
making me jealous.

1677
01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.414
My God.

1678
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.916
Seriously?

1679
01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.086
This is crazy.

1680
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.963
That was Marlon's suggestion.

1681
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.090
Why does every man
suddenly think-

1682
01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.801
- Marlon, Ma, Ma, Ma-
-That that's a good idea.

1683
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.471
Marlon suggested that you
should make me jealous, right?

1684
01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:47.552
That's what you're saying?

1685
01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:49.140
He suggested that you
make me jealous?

1686
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.850
Can we have a conversation,

1687
01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.977
like a normal human
conversation?

1688
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.812
When did we transform

1689
01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.981
into crazy people?

1690
01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.608
And by we, I mean you.

1691
01:02:58.649 --> 01:02:59.525
What is-

1692
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.819
Can I just ask you something?

1693
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:02.861
Tell me the truth.

1694
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:04.947
Did Marlon come over to the
house after I left last night?

1695
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:05.989
My God.

1696
01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.535
Did he, like, did
he kiss you? Did he...

1697
01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:10.577
What was it?

1698
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:12.931
Did he lift you up on the
desk and pull off your panties

1699
01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.499
-and penet-
-Yes. Yes, he did.

1700
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.252
Yes. We had angry, angry
sex on our marital bed.

1701
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.339
- And he, he drilled me so hard.
- You think, you think

1702
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.816
- this is really funny?
- And I, I got hungry.

1703
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.800
No, no! -

1704
01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:24.860
Then I ordered pizza.

1705
01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.676
Yeah, yeah, this is-

1706
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.512
I banged the pizza guy too.

1707
01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:29.931
And then there was
also a plumber,

1708
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.350
and the plumber did that thing,

1709
01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:33.851
that

1710
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.604
thing that they do in the
pornos where all the j,

1711
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.147
the jizz all over my...

1712
01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.941
I couldn't even see.

1713
01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:44.028
And it was like all the
things in all the pornos.

1714
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:44.862
Wow.

1715
01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:45.988
Are you se...

1716
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.698
Of, of course I
didn't do anything.

1717
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.200
I don't know.

1718
01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:50.284
I don't know.

1719
01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:53.412
I don't know what to think.

1720
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:55.122
You're walking away?

1721
01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.543
You're getting in your car?

1722
01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.004
You're starting your car?

1723
01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:07.093
And you're driving away.

1724
01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.158
Jesus. Fuck!

1725
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.928
What are you doing
here on a Saturday?

1726
01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.666
Wait, don't you have
your wife's gallery,

1727
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.084
showy thing tonight?

1728
01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:40.751
You're going to that, right?

1729
01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.086
No.

1730
01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:44.422
Tell me you're going to that.

1731
01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:45.463
Okay.

1732
01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.718
So if you're not gonna
go see your wife tonight,

1733
01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.428
what are you gonna do?

1734
01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:52.555
I'm thinking I'd
order Indian food,

1735
01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.142
watch some TV,
possibly kill myself.

1736
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.935
All right.

1737
01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:58.686
You're coming to
a party with me.

1738
01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.770
Come on.

1739
01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:00.812
That is...

1740
01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:02.607
There's no way that
that is happening.

1741
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.609
Yeah, you need the distraction.

1742
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.985
Yeah. You know what?

1743
01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.337
I'm just gonna stick
with the suicide plan.

1744
01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:09.530
Thanks, though, for offering.

1745
01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.324
It's gonna be fun.

1746
01:05:11.365 --> 01:05:12.365
Yeah,

1747
01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.327
a bunch of millennials
posting photos of themselves?

1748
01:05:14.368 --> 01:05:15.786
No, thank you.

1749
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.122
No, it's actually gonna
be a bunch of hipsters

1750
01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.082
drinking craft beer
outta Mason jars.

1751
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.460
My God, that's so much worse.

1752
01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.797
You got your car with you?

1753
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.841
Yeah. Why?

1754
01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:29.967
Great.

1755
01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:32.136
You're gonna take
me to the party.

1756
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.298
Come on.

1757
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.590
You're not gonna get these
back until you come with me.

1758
01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.602
See where it's going?

1759
01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:40.787
- Let's go.
- My God.

1760
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.480
Ooh.

1761
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:44.607
That's really gross.

1762
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.001
You, you can, you can
just keep all that stuff.

1763
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:46.984
I don't need those things.

1764
01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.903
Let's go, Josh.

1765
01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.240
Do I have, do I have to?

1766
01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.289
Josh, where the hell are you?

1767
01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:02.625
You're not at the motel,
you're not at, at home.

1768
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.001
Your car's not in the driveway.

1769
01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.837
I, I, I need to get back
to the gallery, just,

1770
01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.048
can you please call me back?

1771
01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:10.924
Shit.

1772
01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.856
Okay, you're her husband.

1773
01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.233
Congratulations.

1774
01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:28.275
Another new husband.

1775
01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.087
Do you want some
art to celebrate?

1776
01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.530
I always, always appreciate
it when you buy something

1777
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:35.366
with each 'cause I think we
still got a couple paintings.

1778
01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.260
That one might be
available, I'm not sure.

1779
01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:39.996
This one, I just sold for an
exorbitant amount of money.

1780
01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:41.037
That guy did not seem-

1781
01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.545
Nobody believes
the artist is 15.

1782
01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:49.547
She's selling like hot cakes,

1783
01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:52.466
which is a very
confusing expression

1784
01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:54.385
'cause I don't know about you,

1785
01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:58.180
but after, like, one hot
cake I'm totally full.

1786
01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.812
I'm so sorry.

1787
01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.398
I have to get outta here.

1788
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.315
Yeah.

1789
01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.525
I, I'll walk you.

1790
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.239
You got to butter me up

1791
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.327
Okay, look,

1792
01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.203
I got you here safe,

1793
01:07:21.245 --> 01:07:23.748
and I'm gonna go now, okay?

1794
01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.541
- Put arm around me.
- What?

1795
01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:26.333
Just put your arm around me.

1796
01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:27.126
Why are you doing this?

1797
01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.168
Because...

1798
01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:30.629
Just-

1799
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:32.339
It's the married guy.

1800
01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:33.799
Stop staring.

1801
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.885
Jesus Christ. Stop it.

1802
01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.303
- Stop staring at him.
- What?

1803
01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:39.364
Okay, I just need to keep
your eyes on me, all right?

1804
01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:40.848
Keep your eyes on me.

1805
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.242
Keep your eyes on me
and just look at me

1806
01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:43.326
as if I'm, like, I'm super hot.

1807
01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:44.810
- My God.
- Just do it.

1808
01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:45.852
I'm sorry.

1809
01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:48.707
After all the shit you gave
me about playing games?

1810
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.732
What the hell?

1811
01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.609
Because you are old.

1812
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.069
'Cause you should know better.

1813
01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:55.196
My God. Please, Josh.

1814
01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.447
Come on.

1815
01:07:56.489 --> 01:07:58.407
It's about damage
control tonight.

1816
01:07:58.449 --> 01:07:59.950
I really need your help.

1817
01:07:59.992 --> 01:08:01.470
Things are a little
bit rocky with Gary,

1818
01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:03.913
and I just need to
nudge back in there.

1819
01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:04.954
I thought your generation

1820
01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:06.874
was supposed to be, like,
evolved and, like, woke.

1821
01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:07.958
Don't say woke!

1822
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.394
- What?
- God, you're so embarrassing.

1823
01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:10.418
God!

1824
01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:13.589
All right, game on.

1825
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.507
What?

1826
01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:15.424
Grab a, grab a tit.

1827
01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:16.300
No, I'm not do...

1828
01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.301
I'm not, I'm not doing this.

1829
01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:19.344
No way.

1830
01:08:21.013 --> 01:08:22.013
Fine.

1831
01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.683
I'll do it myself.

1832
01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:30.981
Butter me up

1833
01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:35.861
You've got to butter me up

1834
01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:39.448
Butter me up

1835
01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:44.161
You got to butter me up

1836
01:08:44.745 --> 01:08:47.790
Butter me up

1837
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:52.670
You've got to butter me up

1838
01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:56.298
Butter me up

1839
01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.676
You got to butter me up

1840
01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.973
You never fucking listen to me!

1841
01:09:04.014 --> 01:09:06.183
This is what I fucking
hated about you.

1842
01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.185
Get the fuck out my life.

1843
01:09:10.187 --> 01:09:12.898
Butter me up

1844
01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:14.358
Shake it, baby girl

1845
01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.861
Butter me up

1846
01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:21.782
Hey, Kelly, wait.

1847
01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:23.259
- I'm fine.
- Could you just hold up?

1848
01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:24.033
No, it's fine, Josh.

1849
01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:25.076
Leave me alone.

1850
01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:28.497
Look, hey, just
take, take a breath.

1851
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.336
I just wish we could go back

1852
01:09:34.377 --> 01:09:36.421
to the way we were a week ago.

1853
01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:39.716
I mean, sex was, non-existent,

1854
01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.261
but we didn't care.

1855
01:09:45.139 --> 01:09:49.268
I mean, it wasn't perfect
but at least I was happy.

1856
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.394
We were happy.

1857
01:09:52.062 --> 01:09:53.874
Every relationship
I've ever had ended

1858
01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:56.317
'cause the passion fizzled out,

1859
01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:57.860
and the sex always suffers.

1860
01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:00.070
Anyone who tells you
otherwise is lying.

1861
01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:05.117
I've never been able
to make it stick.

1862
01:10:06.243 --> 01:10:08.287
And look at me, I'm alone.

1863
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.584
What?

1864
01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:14.919
- You want more?
- No, no.

1865
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.104
- I've had enough.
- You want more wine?

1866
01:10:16.128 --> 01:10:17.254
Trust me.

1867
01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:17.922
-I've had more than-
-No, you need more.

1868
01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:18.881
No, don't do that.

1869
01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.967
That's.

1870
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.597
God.

1871
01:10:26.847 --> 01:10:29.016
Hang on, I'm just gonna...

1872
01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:33.979
Hey, stop texting.

1873
01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:37.524
Stop texting, I'm right here.

1874
01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:42.987
Thank you.

1875
01:10:44.114 --> 01:10:45.241
I'll take that.

1876
01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.412
It tastes like shit.

1877
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.501
I'm sorry.

1878
01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:57.086
I'm,

1879
01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:58.128
I'm, I'm,

1880
01:10:58.170 --> 01:10:59.189
I'm not good at
this sort of thing.

1881
01:10:59.213 --> 01:11:00.005
Is that...

1882
01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:00.923
Are you...

1883
01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.132
Is that a, like, maybe...

1884
01:11:02.174 --> 01:11:03.174
Are you thinking of...

1885
01:11:04.301 --> 01:11:05.094
You're not thinking of
kissing me, are you?

1886
01:11:05.135 --> 01:11:06.135
Just...

1887
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.263
I...

1888
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:10.181
Maybe I am.

1889
01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.227
My God.

1890
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.937
- You are.
- I mean, I-

1891
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.563
Wow, that's-

1892
01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.605
No, I...

1893
01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:19.774
What?

1894
01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:23.654
Wait, did you wanna kiss me?

1895
01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:25.489
No, you, you are, you are-

1896
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:26.611
- Who not?
- Cause you're...

1897
01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.135
Well, you're clearly not in
the appropriate head space

1898
01:11:29.159 --> 01:11:30.327
to kiss anybody right now.

1899
01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.287
What are you trying to say?

1900
01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:33.163
And, well, neither am I.

1901
01:11:33.205 --> 01:11:35.332
I mean, I'm, I'm not in
that space either, okay?

1902
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:36.250
-Neither of us... I
think you just made

1903
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.960
a pretty good argument.

1904
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:45.467
Well, any woman or
man would be lu-

1905
01:11:59.857 --> 01:12:00.857
Okay.

1906
01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:02.818
Wow.

1907
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:03.860
That was...

1908
01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:06.779
Wow.

1909
01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:09.532
Thanks.

1910
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:12.077
I took an online course.

1911
01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.038
If that's any indication

1912
01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:17.249
of what sex would
be like with you,

1913
01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.585
it would be like that.

1914
01:12:21.086 --> 01:12:22.379
Yeah, of course, it would be.

1915
01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:26.050
Of course, 'cause I'm
in vulnerable place

1916
01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:29.720
and everything's raw and, um...

1917
01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:32.806
And of course it's
great right now, right?

1918
01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:37.394
Because you're new and
things with me and Josh are...

1919
01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:40.773
It's probably this
really distorted filter.

1920
01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.444
So, no more kissing?

1921
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.238
Sorry.

1922
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.280
Yep.

1923
01:12:50.157 --> 01:12:51.157
Gosh.

1924
01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:19.770
Morning, sexy.

1925
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.065
No.

1926
01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:23.774
No, no, no, no, no.

1927
01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.567
No.

1928
01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:26.693
Would you relax?

1929
01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:28.213
We made out and you
felt me up a little,

1930
01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.279
that was it.

1931
01:13:29.321 --> 01:13:32.282
I'm, I'm, I'm a monster.

1932
01:13:32.324 --> 01:13:33.450
I'm a horrible person.

1933
01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.203
I've done a very,
very, very bad thing.

1934
01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:39.081
Dude, you were trying
to cheer me up, okay?

1935
01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.975
I was all conflicted
over the Gary thing

1936
01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.252
and you were just
helping me move on.

1937
01:13:43.293 --> 01:13:44.420
You're a good friend.

1938
01:13:44.461 --> 01:13:46.547
I've ruined everything forever.

1939
01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.588
Um,

1940
01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:51.844
and I'm in love with you.

1941
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:05.607
Hey, Kelly, I'm...

1942
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:09.796
I, I don't know what to say.

1943
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.196
I ha, I had no idea.

1944
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.366
Well, things between
you and Emma

1945
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:15.784
look like they're falling apart,

1946
01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:19.955
so I just wanted you
to know I'm here.

1947
01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.334
I mean, we have fun
together, we get along.

1948
01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:26.837
I'm super fun.

1949
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.134
I think you could
do a lot worse.

1950
01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.677
God. No.

1951
01:14:33.927 --> 01:14:35.512
I mean, of course...

1952
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:36.472
Worse?

1953
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:38.599
Look, you're, you're amazing.

1954
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
I know.

1955
01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.809
So?

1956
01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.650
I'm, I'm in love with Emma.

1957
01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.777
She's the love of my life.

1958
01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.779
I'm sorry. What was that?

1959
01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.532
She, she's the one.

1960
01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.367
She's always been
the one for me.

1961
01:14:57.409 --> 01:15:00.871
I'm, I wanna be
with her forever.

1962
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.624
-I mean, no matter
what... Come again.

1963
01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.837
My God.

1964
01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:11.798
You, you fucking with me again!

1965
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.300
- Whoa!
- Well, it worked.

1966
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.469
You know what?

1967
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.387
You, you know, you
have a problem.

1968
01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:18.263
You have a series of problems.

1969
01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.806
You're disturbed.

1970
01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.141
Um, I just saved your marriage,

1971
01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.392
so you're welcome.

1972
01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.186
Please. You don't even
believe in marriage.

1973
01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:26.355
No, just because I
think monogamy

1974
01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:29.024
is a fundamentally flawed
and antiquated construct

1975
01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.734
doesn't mean it's
bullshit for everyone.

1976
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.363
And you have to go pick
up your offspring.

1977
01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:37.241
Hey, is this room on
your credit card?

1978
01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:38.575
Yeah. Why?

1979
01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:42.162
Great. I'm gonna
order room service.

1980
01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.372
Hey.

1981
01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:44.164
Hey. Psst.

1982
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.374
Yeah.

1983
01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:46.833
Happy anniversary.

1984
01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.546
Shit.

1985
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.630
Right.

1986
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Josh?

1987
01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.054
Em, we gotta go!

1988
01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.514
We're gonna be late!

1989
01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:45.976
Em?

1990
01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.497
Wendy, what the fuck?

1991
01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:08.539
What?

1992
01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.876
Where's Josh?

1993
01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:12.919
I'm sorry, I, I, I just...

1994
01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.041
I didn't mean to trick you.

1995
01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:15.714
I just didn't know how
else to get you alone.

1996
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:16.715
I needed to talk to you.

1997
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:17.883
Now?

1998
01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:19.343
In a motel?

1999
01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:20.719
Well, you said you'd
never had sex

2000
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:23.263
on a swing before, right?

2001
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.473
There's a swing.

2002
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:27.809
My God. Jesus.

2003
01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:28.602
That...

2004
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:29.978
I...

2005
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.814
Wendy, I was just,
like, spitballing.

2006
01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.817
You, you'd said you
wanted to try a swing

2007
01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:38.904
and Josh never
done that for you.

2008
01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:42.699
And I think, I think things
between you are broken.

2009
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.285
Actually, my
relationship with Josh

2010
01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:48.163
is the only thing
that isn't broken.

2011
01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:52.376
Wendy, I'm so sorry for fucking
everything up between us,

2012
01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:53.502
okay?

2013
01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:54.503
I'm really sorry.

2014
01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:55.837
I came alive that night,

2015
01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:57.047
and you woke me up.

2016
01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.965
And I know you felt
something too.

2017
01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.635
Just give me one more chance.

2018
01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.679
I didn't, I was faking.

2019
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.554
I'm sorry.

2020
01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:05.639
I didn't.

2021
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.681
I...

2022
01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:08.475
And we already tried that,
and look where it got us.

2023
01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:09.226
Look at this.

2024
01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:10.267
This is weird.

2025
01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:13.855
Okay, so fine.

2026
01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:15.375
So you just wanna
make out a little or, or-

2027
01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.191
No!

2028
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.234
No!

2029
01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:19.903
Well, wh, what about
the sex swing?

2030
01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.465
You have no idea how
hard it was for me

2031
01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.491
to put up that thing.

2032
01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.118
I don't, I don't wanna make out.

2033
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:28.286
I don't wanna have sex
on the sex swing.

2034
01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:29.788
I just want,

2035
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:34.084
I just wanna erase everything
and have my friend back,

2036
01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.919
okay?

2037
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.046
Can I please have
my friend back, like,

2038
01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.258
without the sex stuff, please?

2039
01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:44.553
Yes.

2040
01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:46.930
You can have your friend back.

2041
01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:52.686
You know, maybe once
in a while down the road,

2042
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:56.022
if we're really drunk some
time and the vibe is right-

2043
01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.190
-No. -No?

2044
01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.275
Not gonna happen.

2045
01:18:58.316 --> 01:19:00.193
Not gonna happen.

2046
01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.905
If I go to leave,

2047
01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:07.117
you promise you're not gonna
punch me in the throat?

2048
01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.120
I promise I will not
punch you in the throat.

2049
01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:14.124
You have to really push.

2050
01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.751
Tricky one.

2051
01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.513
Dawn?

2052
01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:29.555
Gracie?

2053
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.019
Surprise!

2054
01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.356
Daddy!

2055
01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:39.566
Hey.

2056
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.610
- Happy Anniversary.
- Were you surprised?

2057
01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:43.111
Yes, I was surprised.

2058
01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:45.363
Where's Mommy?

2059
01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:46.281
That's...

2060
01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.784
I'm gonna tell you in one sec,

2061
01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:51.119
so just hold, hold on.

2062
01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:52.078
Wow.

2063
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.790
Arthur, worth the surprise.

2064
01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:57.334
Well, I thought it'd be good
for you guys to come back here.

2065
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.376
Old memories.

2066
01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:03.673
- Yeah.
- So where's my Emma?

2067
01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:04.841
Ha!

2068
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.092
Right. One...

2069
01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.135
I will get to that.

2070
01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:08.011
Hi, everybody.

2071
01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:08.929
Hi.

2072
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.514
Thank you for being here.

2073
01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:11.973
Hello?

2074
01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:12.974
That's...

2075
01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:15.519
That seems unnecessary.

2076
01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560
Thank you.

2077
01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:21.149
Um, so it's really, it's
unexpected to see you all here.

2078
01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.609
This is...

2079
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.295
It's been a long time since
I've been in this room.

2080
01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:27.531
And, um, you know, seeing
all your familiar faces here,

2081
01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:28.572
it's weird.

2082
01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:30.200
It's like, 'cause it's
out of context.

2083
01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.701
- Dad?
- Yeah.

2084
01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:33.203
You're being super awkward.

2085
01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:35.997
- Yep.
- Yeah.

2086
01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:37.958
Seriously, where's Mom?

2087
01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.627
Mom? Where's Mom?

2088
01:20:42.128 --> 01:20:45.382
So I bet you're all
wondering where Emma is.

2089
01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:48.552
Funny story.

2090
01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:54.933
You know how sometimes
you, when you wake up, right?

2091
01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:55.892
So Emma...

2092
01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.603
So this is, this is a good one.

2093
01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.564
So your mom, when your
mom, when Emma woke...

2094
01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:03.733
She wakes up and...

2095
01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:04.776
I...

2096
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.945
Look...

2097
01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:07.863
She's here.

2098
01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:08.738
She just pulled up.

2099
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.656
I'll be right back.

2100
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.574
Everybody wait here.

2101
01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:11.741
It's fine.

2102
01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:14.411
Mom's here.

2103
01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:15.245
Party begins.

2104
01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.287
Yeah.

2105
01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.420
Hi. - Hey.

2106
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.088
I went by the house
to pick you up.

2107
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.173
I know. It's a long story.

2108
01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.258
I'll tell you later.

2109
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.300
Okay.

2110
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.346
Wendy told me that all
our friends and family

2111
01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.848
are in there.

2112
01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:39.144
I guess you were right
about my dad's big plan.

2113
01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.898
I, I, I have to tell
you something.

2114
01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:47.736
Um, I, um, I made out
with Kelly last night.

2115
01:21:48.778 --> 01:21:51.865
I might have touched
her boobs a little.

2116
01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.243
Different Kelly.

2117
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.953
But I only did it because
I thought that,

2118
01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.788
that you slept with Marlon.

2119
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.081
I didn't sleep with Marlon.

2120
01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:01.791
I, I know.

2121
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.752
I, I, I, I know that now.

2122
01:22:03.793 --> 01:22:06.504
Of course you, of course
you didn't sleep with Marlon.

2123
01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:07.546
Idiot.

2124
01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.345
I'm so sorry.

2125
01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:14.179
Just shut up.

2126
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.220
I love you.

2127
01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.605
We really messed things
up there, didn't we?

2128
01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:24.981
That was, that was all crazy.

2129
01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.275
We saw my parents
having group sex.

2130
01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:29.985
It's a metaphor.

2131
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.281
Yeah, at the sex
club that we went to.

2132
01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.824
That weird room.

2133
01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:36.159
My God, that was so weird.

2134
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.244
- The bunny lady.
- Yes.

2135
01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.329
Those horse guys.

2136
01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.455
Yeah.

2137
01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:42.582
By the way,
they're, they're here.

2138
01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.501
Your dad must have-

2139
01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:45.460
For the love of God.

2140
01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:48.171
Why is no one turning this off?

2141
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.382
Do you know where we are?

2142
01:22:50.423 --> 01:22:51.508
Yeah.

2143
01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:52.676
This is the,

2144
01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:54.070
- this is the exact spot.
- This is the spot.

2145
01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.553
My God. Yeah.

2146
01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:57.639
It was, it was Disco Night.

2147
01:22:58.598 --> 01:22:59.700
- I was so excited.
- You were,

2148
01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:00.868
you were headed
back to your cabin,

2149
01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:02.244
- you were walking back.
- And then

2150
01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:05.647
you tapped me on the
shoulder and I turned around,

2151
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:08.233
and you leaned in with
this confidence that-

2152
01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:21.454
Our teens, 20s-

2153
01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.496
God.

2154
01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:25.792
We're not those people anymore.

2155
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.753
No, we're not.

2156
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:33.133
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

2157
01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.051
Hey, you guys.

2158
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.433
Hey.

2159
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.646
All right.

2160
01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:47.480
Let's go, let's go.

2161
01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.314
Everyone's waiting.

2162
01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.899
Come on, you guys.

2163
01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.569
Daddy, you should
stop saying bad words,

2164
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.988
'cause we could hear
everything you say.

2165
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.114
Dear, that...

2166
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:56.948
No, that's not...

2167
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.158
That's not good.

2168
01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.910
What's a sex club?

2169
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:14.174
I've got you down to a science

2170
01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:18.386
But you don't stand a chance

2171
01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.346
You play your tricks, girl

2172
01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.390
You can't deny it

2173
01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:26.269
But you don't stand a chance

2174
01:24:29.814 --> 01:24:33.318
You've got to butter me up

2175
01:24:37.655 --> 01:24:41.910
Don't you hurt my precious ego

2176
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:46.122
You know what to do

2177
01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:49.626
Don't go saying
things to be nasty

2178
01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.711
Unless you follow through

2179
01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.678
You've got to butter me up

2180
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:07.185
You've got to butter me up

2181
01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:11.856
You've got to butter me up

2182
01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.652
Butter me up

2183
01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:18.530
You've got to butter me up

2184
01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.991
Two, three

2185
01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:15.753
Butter me up

2186
01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:20.508
You've got to butter me up

2187
01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:24.220
Butter me up

2188
01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:28.600
You've got to butter me up

2189
01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:32.604
Butter me up

2190
01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:36.733
You've got to butter me up

2191
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.987
Butter me up

2192
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:45.533
You got to butter me up

2193
01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:49.537
You got to butter me up

2194
01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:50.830
Shake it, baby girl

2195
01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.958
Butter me up

2196
01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.879
Butter me up

2197
01:26:57.921 --> 01:26:59.339
Shake it, baby girl

2198
01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.425
Butter me up
