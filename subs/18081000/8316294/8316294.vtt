[Dawn] Mommy?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.110
What's on your face, Dawn?

4
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:28.445
Makeup.

5
00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.864
I wanna look nice
for the first day.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:31.740
[Grace] Dad?

7
00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:32.907
[Josh] Yeah.

8
00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.617
I made sandwiches for the bus.

9
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.470
Do you think I put
too much ketchup?

10
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.454
What?

11
00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.495
No.

12
00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:39.956
There's no such thing
as too much ketchup,

13
00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.416
you know that.

Yay, waffles are ready!

[lively music]

18
00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.467
We could keep 'em
with us for the week.

19
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.986
I mean, we, we lose
the money, but...

[smoke alarm beeping]

21
00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:54.488
We can't have this
conversation again

22

'cause the bus is
coming in an hour.

23
00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:58.767
Just a week.

Camp is good, remember?

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:01.102
Camp is, camp is good.

Yeah, in here.

31
00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.235
Okay, okay.

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:10.028
Good, good, good.

33
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.070
Yes.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.073
Yes.

35
00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:13.907
You got everything.

36
00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:14.741
I have everything.

37
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:15.533
I already checked.

38
00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.576
Okay, I know.

39
00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.827
You're doing great.

40
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.289
Undies?

41
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.039
Undies?

42
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.166
I'm wearing 'em.

- [Emma] Grace?
- What?

44
00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:27.837
Serious, what?

45
00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.591
What, only taking one pair?

46
00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:32.467
Duh.

47
00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.134
I only have one butt.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.970
Honey, you're eight.

49
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.473
[Grace] Yeah, but 14%
of girls get their periods

50
00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.765
by the age of 10.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.313
Well, not that much.

And the youngest recorded case

56
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.154
of a girl giving birth

Wait, I'm not done talking.

58
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.908
- [Emma] Okay.
- In Peru in 1938.

59
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:00.662
Let's just take the
whole box then.

[box rustling]

61
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:07.168
And, girls, it is totally normal
to feel homesick at camp.

62
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.336
Okay?

63
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.923
So when you're away from
your family, it can be hard.

64
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.007
So look,

65
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.485
if you get that feeling
in your chest

66
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.010
and it kind of overwhelms you,

67
00:02:16.052 --> 00:02:17.052
it's fine.

68
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.199
Just take a moment and you
think of a happy memory,

69
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.267
something that we all
did together as a family.

70
00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:25.311
And when that happens,
you'll feel better.

71
00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.105
Are, are you crying?

72
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.982
No, I'm not. [chuckles]

73
00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:30.942
Of course I am not crying.

74
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.110
I'm a grownup, I'm not...

75
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.319
It's okay to cry, though.

76
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.172
Just so you know,
crying is totally fine.

77
00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.698
[Grace] Good, uh, pep talk.

78
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:37.866
Thanks.

Don't worry.

You're not there for
long, right?

Hey, it's only seven days.

83
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.373
What's seven days, right?

84
00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:46.374
Seven days is nothing.

85

We have seven gnomes.

Seven gnomes for seven days.

We'll count down the
days per gnome.

Don't worry, it's
gonna go by quick.

Take care of Daddy.

[Dawn] This is the camp
where you met Mommy.

92
00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.110
I love you so much.
[Josh] Yeah, a long time ago.

93
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:57.444
Maybe we'll meet our
husband there too.

94
00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.405
You'll meet your husbands
there, okay?

95
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.709
You're gonna meet your husbands.

96
00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:03.242
You won't have the same
husband, that's, that's illegal.

every second of the day.

very short week.

113

So what do we do now?

121
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.564
I literally have no idea.

122
00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.983
I mean, we could drive
to the gymnastics studio

123
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.737
and just sit in the
parents' waiting area.

124
00:03:57.987 --> 00:03:58.947
Yeah. I don't know.

125
00:03:58.988 --> 00:03:59.781
As comforting as that sounds-

126
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:00.925
Ooh, we could go for brunch.

127
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:01.950
We used to like brunch.

128
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:02.784
Yeah, bru, the bru...

129
00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:03.743
Definitely.

130
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.828
Ooh, we could go see a matinee.

Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:08.915
When was the last time
we went to see a matinee?

133
00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.083
Do they still have matinees?

134
00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:10.625
- Is that still even a thing?
- I don't...

135
00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:11.626
Probably not.

to close the door.

No, no.

00:06:22.423 --> 00:06:25.718
It's the least attractive
part of the male anatomy.

188
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.554
Yeah, and that's saying a lot.

189
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:30.264
I think this is the longest

190
00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.600
I've ever stared at
a pair of these.

191
00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.685
You know, I'm very
uncomfortable.

192
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:35.770
[Marlon] Emma?

193
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:36.687
Emma Michaels?

194
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.606
Oh God. Marlon.

195
00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.441
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

196
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.693
I can't believe it's
Emma Michaels.

197
00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:43.735
Oh my...

198
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.131
I had, like, the biggest
crush on you in art school.

199
00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:47.155
Wow.

200
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.635
Well, you still have that thing
where you just say things.

201
00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.534
What?

202
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:51.369
Without a filter.

203
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.411
No, I don't.

204
00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:54.932
- I didn't do that, did I?
- Yeah, you just did.

205
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.125
You just did it when you
said you had a crush on me.

206
00:06:57.166 --> 00:06:57.959
On no, it was a major crush.

207
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.793
I kept a journal about it.

208
00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.128
You just did it again.

209
00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.730
Well, no, I had photos
in a special binder.

210
00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.548
How the hell are you?

211
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.590
I'm, I'm good.

212
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.383
I'm fine.

213
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.968
- I'm great.
- Yeah?

214
00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.511
Married? Kids?

215
00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:09.512
All of the above.

216
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:11.139
Yeah, I married Josh, actually.

217
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.306
Oh my God.

218
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.183
You married your
boyfriend from camp.

219
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:16.686
Wow, that's so adorable.

220
00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:21.023
Uh, I mean, we, we broke
up on and off, you know,

221
00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:24.402
and played the field
before we settled down.

222
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.155
And now, you know, we
have two beautiful little girls.

223
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.531
Let me show you their Halloween-

224
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.407
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

225
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:30.867
That's okay. No.

226
00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:32.302
People without kids are
always pretending they care

227
00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:33.512
to see photos of
other people's kids,

228
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.538
but really we're
just being polite.

229
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.874
[Emma laughs]

230
00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:39.000
Ah, no, no filter.

231
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:40.585
Yeah.

232
00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:41.461
Oh my God.

233
00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.838
So, is this your gallery?

234
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.256
Oh yeah. It's all mine.

235
00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.591
Um, yeah,

236
00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.860
I finally realized that
I was far better suited

237
00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.510
to appreciate the work of others

238
00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:52.346
than to produce anything
of value myself, um,

239
00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:55.016
like these bad boys right here.

240
00:07:55.057 --> 00:07:57.894
What do you think
of these testicles?

241
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:07.653
[Wendy hissing]

242
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.530
Like.

243
00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:12.533
Really?

244
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:13.575
No.

245
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:16.037
Emma, what do you think?

246
00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:16.871
Honestly?

247
00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:17.872
Yeah.

248
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:20.875
I mean, [scoffs]

249
00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.797
no one really wants
to look at balls.

250
00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:26.214
[Emma clicks teeth]

251
00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:28.758
[Wendy groans]

252
00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:32.677
Oh my God.

253
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.056
You're right.

254
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.894
Balls are totally gross.

255
00:08:41.645 --> 00:08:42.813
Jacques.

256
00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.458
Yeah, can you, can you
take this one down?

257
00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:45.501
-No. -And, uh,

258
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.901
- and, and those two.
- You don't-

259
00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:47.943
And, uh...

260
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:53.157
Yeah, and, and that
one over there.

261
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:54.033
You're kidding.

262
00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:54.909
No, my apologies

263
00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:55.951
I...

264
00:08:57.078 --> 00:08:59.997
Oh my God, you're crazy.

265
00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.040
Oh my God.

266
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.251
[Emma laughing]

267
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.418
Oh my God.

268
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.419
Sorry.

269
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.461
Wendy.

270
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.048
My name is Wendy.

271
00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:10.925
Oh my gosh.

272
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:11.967
I'm so sorry.

273
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.929
Um, Wendy, this is Marlon.

274
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.597
We went to art school together.

275
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:17.473
Yeah, I got that.

276
00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.642
Wendy and I are teaching

277
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.937
this winter break art camp

278
00:09:22.979 --> 00:09:26.315
for at-risk youth just at the
rec center down the street.

279
00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:28.568
The kids are amazing.

280
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:30.820
Uh, this one girl, Aisha,

281
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.283
has more talent at 15
than I, like, ever had.

282
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.159
She, like, blows my
mind every day.

283
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:39.121
Wow. Well, I would love
to come and see her work.

284
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:39.996
Yeah, you should.

285
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.077
You could come by anytime.

286
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:44.043
And that would give me an
excuse to come see you.

287
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:46.877
I can't believe you're married.

288
00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:47.980
I mean, I used to fantasize

289
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.714
about having a bubble
bath with you.

290
00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:50.673
Oh, that's very specific.

291
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:51.715
Well, not naked, though.

292
00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:53.884
I mean you were, you were
wearing a green bikini.

293
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:55.970
Always green for some reason.

294
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:57.263
You're doing it again.

295
00:09:57.305 --> 00:09:58.306
Oh, right.

296
00:09:58.347 --> 00:09:59.807
-Sorry. -Oh no.

297
00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:00.849
Yes?

298
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:03.936
[door slams]

299
00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:06.564
[pensive music]

300
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.655
[gnome clinks]

301
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:15.823
Yeah.

302
00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:18.117
I don't know, it seems
a little, um,

303
00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.036
unnecessarily sexualized.

304
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:22.203
No?

305
00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:24.332
How so?

306
00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:25.373
Um, well,

307
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.171
you can pretty much
see her nipple there.

308
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:33.007
And she's fellating a banana.

309
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:36.469
And your problem with this is?

310
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.681
Well it's, it's an ad
for, for fruit.

311
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.975
Yeah, this is what
the client wants.

312
00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.851
Okay.

313
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:44.893
Have we tried to, like,

314
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:48.230
gently steer the client
in another direction?

315
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:53.527
Yeah, we're gonna stick
with a general approach

316
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:54.921
of giving the client
what they want.

317
00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:55.945
Okay?

318
00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:57.865
Yeah, you're the
packaging editor, Josh.

319
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.785
Just focus on editing
the package.

320
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:01.952
Okay.

321
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.997
[indistinct chatter]

322
00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:10.670
- [Kelly] Hey.
- Hi.

323
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.004
[Kelly] Good meeting?

324
00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.214
[Josh sighs]

325
00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.216
[Josh] Everybody here hates me.

326
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.050
Not me.

327
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.010
I find you amusing.

328
00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:19.905
Kelly, what do you think
of that ad right there?

329
00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.014
Uh, that reminds me
of Gary's penis.

330
00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:24.350
What, Gary, that's
the married guy?

331
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:25.410
- [Kelly] Mm-hmm.
- And, and,

332
00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:27.478
and his penis looks
like a banana?

333
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.646
Yeah, like that one.

334
00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.398
The one on the right.

335
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.525
So,

336
00:11:32.566 --> 00:11:35.194
how often would you say you
and are having an orgasm:

337
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.363
A, once a day; B, twice a day;

338
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:38.614
C, three times a day;

339
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:42.576
or D, you are constantly
in an orgasmic fog?

340
00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:45.913
Uh, oral counts and anal counts.

341
00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.540
Well, anal definitely counts.

342
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:50.251
So don't spare any
details, I'm not squeamish.

343
00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.294
Wait, tho, tho, those
are the options?

344
00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:55.464
I mean, the, the minimum
in there is, is, is once a day?

345
00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:56.632
Yeah.

346
00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.217
Why?

347
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.093
Nothing.

348
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:00.094
It's just, you know,

349
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.929
when you're married
for 10 years-

350
00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:03.055
Uh, "When you're ma..."

351
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.951
No, see, this is exactly what
I've been trying to tell you.

352
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.953
This monogamy is just
created by a patriarchal society

353
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.354
that totally suppresses
any sexual promiscuity.

354
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:11.939
It is bullshit.

355
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:12.857
So what?

356
00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.526
Like once, uh, a week?

357
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.738
Yeah. I mean, that
sounds about right.

358
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:19.864
- Yeah.
- Are you kidding?

359
00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:21.198
-What? -Dude?

360
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.200
I was kidding.

361
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:25.202
You ha, you have
sex once a week?

362
00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.747
Why are you suddenly so
interested in my sex life?

363
00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:29.123
Oh, don't be such a narcissist.

364
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:30.791
I'm interested in
everybody's sex life,

365
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.334
especially married people.

366
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.878
-Okay. -Wait.

367
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.796
So this is, this is
research for your,

368
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.607
for your affair with
Gary, is it?

369
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.925
[phone ringing]

370
00:12:39.967 --> 00:12:40.968
Forget it.

371
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:42.970
I'm gonna figure it out myself.

372
00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.013
Oh my God.

373
00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:46.766
What do these people
want from me?

374
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:48.434
Hello.

375
00:12:48.476 --> 00:12:49.643
Kelly speaking.

376
00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.978
Oh no-[speaking faintly]

377
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.939
[whimsical music]

378
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.255
[Josh scoffs]

379
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.925
[papers rustle]

380
00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:26.597
[whimsical music continues]

381
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.433
[note beeps]

382
00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:32.228
[note beeps]

383
00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:34.688
[note beeps]

384
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.607
[note beeps]

385
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:37.858
[note beeps]

386
00:13:38.108 --> 00:13:41.695
[whimsical music continues]

387
00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:50.579
So you've gone back to
layering color over text?

388
00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:55.501
But this time some
of the text is illegible.

389
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:59.880
That's interesting
choices, Aisha.

390
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.048
Thanks.

391
00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:04.426
So of all your work,

392
00:14:04.468 --> 00:14:07.388
is there one that you'd
like to try and finish?

393
00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.390
Uh, no, thanks.

394
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:11.267
No.

395
00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:12.726
Then they'd just be

396
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.895
closed.

397
00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.063
They'd be, like,

398
00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:18.274
dead.

399
00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:19.984
[Student] Mm-hmm.

400
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.485
[alarm ringing]

401
00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:23.988
Okay. That's it for today.

402
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.031
I'll see you tomorrow.

403
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.051
[Wendy] Everyone, grab
your folders on the way out.

404
00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:30.744
Aisha, this is great work.

405
00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:32.997
This is really special.

406
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.750
No one else seems to think so.

407
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.669
Do you care what they think?

408
00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.630
Trust me, they're jealous.

409
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.967
[indistinct chatter]

410
00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.056
Marlon?

411
00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.641
What are you doing here?

412
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.102
You invited me to see
your students' work.

413
00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:56.145
And I came,

414
00:14:56.186 --> 00:14:57.622
even though the
term at-risk youth

415
00:14:57.646 --> 00:14:59.732
makes me very uncomfortable.

416
00:14:59.773 --> 00:15:03.277
Okay. Well, um, you're
safe 'cause they're all gone.

417
00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:04.820
[Wendy clears throat]

418
00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.548
I'm just gonna get my
stuff from the staff room.

419
00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.490
[Wendy clears throat]

420
00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:11.368
Whoa.

421
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.661
What have we here?

422
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.246
Oh, that's Aisha.

423
00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:15.932
That's the student I
was telling you about.

424
00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:16.790
Well, you weren't kidding.

425
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.167
These are, these are terrific.

426
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:20.169
I love the half
finished aesthetic.

427
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.795
I know, right?

428
00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:23.339
She's amazing.

429
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.507
You're amazing.

430
00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:26.550
[Emma chuckles]

431
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.635
That was weird.

432
00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:28.719
Yeah.

433
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.821
No, this, this whole
thing's weird.

434
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:31.472
I, it's weird that I
came down here.

435
00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:33.074
I, I should really get
back to the gallery.

436
00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:34.576
You, you should come
see me there sometime.

437
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.893
It wouldn't be as-

438
00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:37.095
-Weird. -Yeah.

439
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:40.648
Um, yeah.

440
00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:43.108
I, I'll come sometime

441
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.902
just stop by.

442
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.153
-Okay. -Okay.

443
00:15:46.195 --> 00:15:47.571
[Emma chuckling]

444
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.156
What?

445
00:15:49.198 --> 00:15:50.658
Great.

446
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.093
Okay, I should leave
'cause I have an erection.

447
00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:53.494
Oh, okay.

448
00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.971
But don't worry, it might
not be from the hug.

449
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.182
It, it, it could be from seeing
your student's great work

450
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.458
It's probably a little of both,

451
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.167
but mostly from the hug.

452
00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:01.209
Bye.

453
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:04.964
[door slams]

454
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.633
[techno music]

455

- [object clattering]
- [Emma moaning]

456
00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:23.023
I have judo in 20 minutes.

457
00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:24.065
What?

458
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.694
What are you thinking about?

459
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.533
Not on the list.

460
00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:34.284
Well, it's not.

461
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:38.122
Every time you call me a
little bitch it loses impact.

462
00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.540
I don't even hear it anymore.

463
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.625
It literally has no
effect on me.

464
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:42.710
Oh yeah?

465
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.111
How about fucktard?
Is that better?

466
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.315
Or, or what about OCD,
control freak, asshole, shit tits?

467
00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.841
Oh my God.

468
00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:51.301
You do know I can smell
your breath from here, right?

469
00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:52.845
What did you eat today?

470
00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.555
Was it somebody ass?

471
00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:57.057
Did you eat someone's
ass for lunch?

472
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.684
Goddamn!

473
00:16:58.726 --> 00:16:59.518
[Janice] Hey, Josh.

474
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.561
- Oh my gosh.
- What?

475
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:03.063
- It's Andrew and Janice.
- Hey, guys.

476
00:17:03.105 --> 00:17:05.398
You wanna finish your
thought for Josh and Emma?

477
00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:08.652
You were saying something
about my, uh, shit tits.

478
00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:09.569
[Emma] Um, we're good.

479
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:10.404
Yeah, no, I think we're,

480
00:17:10.445 --> 00:17:11.780
I think we're okay.

481
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:15.284
Uh, so, guys, how,
how's it, how's it going?

482
00:17:15.325 --> 00:17:16.785
We're separating.

483
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.288
Janice is moving out tomorrow.

484
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.164
I'm sorry.

485
00:17:20.204 --> 00:17:21.832
Yeah, so, wh, why-

486
00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:22.833
Why are we separating?

487
00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.710
Oh, where to begin?

488
00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:26.396
Well, you could
start with the lies.

489
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.337
Mm.

490
00:17:27.378 --> 00:17:28.578
I was gonna lead with the fact

491
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:30.275
that you haven't touched
me in two years.

492
00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.342
Yeah, and why, why
would I touch you?

493
00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:34.928
All you do is tell lies.

494
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.970
I was,

495
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.241
I was just gonna ask why you
guys are shopping together

496
00:17:38.265 --> 00:17:40.350
if you, if you're
moving out tomorrow.

497
00:17:40.392 --> 00:17:42.770
[Emma chuckles]

498
00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:45.439
That's a great fucking question.

499
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:50.319
- [bag thuds]
- [kernels rattling]

500
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.196
Are you okay?

501
00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:56.533
Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.577
I'm o, I'm okay.

503
00:17:58.619 --> 00:18:00.370
The kids are devastated.

504
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:02.039
And, um,

505
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:04.541
we're probably gonna
have to sell the house,

506
00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.293
and I'm gonna die alone.

507
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:12.841
[worker] Clean up in Aisle 6.

508
00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.427
[Emma] They just, they
seemed like the best couple.

509
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.512
I, I know.

510
00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.346
I know.

511
00:18:17.387 --> 00:18:18.597
It's like,

512
00:18:18.639 --> 00:18:20.849
I guess things just turn
on a dime so quickly.

513
00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:23.393
One day they've got that
honeymoon glow and the next day-

514
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.563
Why did you lie about
ejaculating the other day?

515
00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:27.689
I don't know.

516
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:31.276
Do we lie to each other?

517
00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:33.070
No, we don't lie to each other.

518
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:34.238
We're us, all right?

519
00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:35.280
I mean, I, I, I...

520
00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:37.282
I mean, I, I, I, I don't.

521
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:39.493
Why, do you, do, do you lie?

522
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:42.371
[Emma scoffs]

523
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:43.412
Uh, I mean,

524
00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.918
I sort of faked my orgasm too.

525
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.919
What?

526
00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.796
You, you, you, what?

527
00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:51.838
Oh, come on,

528
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:53.757
it's totally normal
for a woman to fake it.

529
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.175
For a guy, that's fucked up.

530
00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.260
That's not...

531
00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.347
No, that's, that's like
reverse sexism or something.

532
00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.682
That is a double standard.

533
00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:02.516
-And I'm not just gonna
stand... Oh, now I think

534
00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:03.267
you're avoiding the question.

535
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.308
Wow.

536
00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:06.854
[both sighs]

537
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:08.689
Look, we love each other, right?

538
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.023
We're great parents together.

539
00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.608
We make a great team.

540
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.336
It's just married
life, you know?

541
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:17.322
I mean, the sex becomes
less important, I guess.

542
00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:18.550
Yeah, but don't you
think it's weird

543
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:19.658
we don't talk about it?

544
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.617
Ugh.

545
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.035
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

546
00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:22.786
I don't know.

547
00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.621
It's a can of worms.

548
00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:28.917
I mean, it's like that mango
chicken stir fry you make.

549
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:31.420
How exactly?

550
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:32.629
Ugh.

551
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.507
Well, you know, I don't
love it, um,

552
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.342
but I eat it and I
don't make a fuss

553
00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:40.095
'cause that's just
part of the deal.

554
00:19:40.137 --> 00:19:41.722
[toy clatters]

555
00:19:43.974 --> 00:19:45.809
Maybe if I added cashews?

556
00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.102
Let's not overreact, okay?

557
00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.812
We're not Andrew and Janice.

558
00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.856
We, we can figure this out.

559
00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:54.568
We've had many years
of sex, great sex.

560
00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:57.738
We know how to bang, right?

561
00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.490
Yeah, that's never been
a problem for us, right?

562
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:03.827
I mean, you know, it's not
like we haven't sown our oats.

563
00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.430
You know, I had sex with a
reasonable amount of women.

564
00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:06.496
Oh yeah. I know, I know.

565
00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:07.164
You don't have to
go through the list.

566
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:07.998
I've had my fun too.

567
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.334
I had, I had my slutty year.

568
00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:11.375
Yeah, can you...

569
00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:12.753
We talked about you
not calling it that.

570
00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:13.587
Can we not?

571
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.714
Okay, everything I've ever read,

572
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.841
the main complaint about sex

573
00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:21.428
is that one person thinks
of it more than the other.

574
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.430
Okay. Well, then that's
not our problem, right?

575
00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:25.933
Because we, we have a
shared disinterest in sex,

576
00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.143
like a, like a mutual apathy.

577
00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:30.353
Yeah.

578
00:20:31.605 --> 00:20:32.605
Just...

579
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.484
But then... [groans]

580
00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:36.318
[Josh] What?

581
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.653
What? What?

582
00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:38.445
I don't know.

583
00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.780
I...

584
00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:41.406
It's just... [sighs]

585
00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:42.324
This is probably nothing.

586
00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.617
It's just these past few days

587
00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:46.411
I've been thinking
a lot about sex.

588
00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:47.412
Hey, that's cool.

589
00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:48.580
I get it.

590
00:20:48.622 --> 00:20:51.416
I mean, well, I've been
working out more.

591
00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:53.436
I've been, uh, I've been
watching what I eat, you know?

592
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.460
It's sort of...

593
00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:55.921
It's really it's about
portion control, mostly

594
00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.089
I'm...

595
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.215
Oh shit, you...

596
00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:01.343
You've been, you,

597
00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.654
you've been thinking
about having sex

598
00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.638
with people who aren't me.

599
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.308
[Emma sighs]

600
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.644
It's just we have this one week,

601
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.229
this one week to...

602
00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.939
We could fuck in every
room in the house

603
00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:14.999
without the kids barging in,

604
00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:18.402
but we're just... [whimpers]

605
00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:19.569
We're not.

606
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:23.657
Okay. All right.

607
00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:25.075
Look,

608
00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.703
[whimsical music]

609
00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:29.663
we got time, right?

610
00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:30.789
Let's not...

611
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.684
We got, like, five more
days, right?

612
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:33.625
Yes.

613
00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:34.835
I wanna fix this.

614
00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:35.669
Let's fix this.

615
00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:36.545
Okay. All right.

616
00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:37.838
So, like, what are we thinking?

617
00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:40.507
Like maybe like, like
an orgy with like, uh-

618
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:41.842
Butter.

619
00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:43.719
Like a vat of butter.

620
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.137
Oh, now I want butter.

621
00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:46.013
Hmm.

622
00:21:46.054 --> 00:21:47.139
Or I could get like a,

623
00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.682
that enlargement
surgery for my penis,

624
00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.076
- for my little tiny penis.
- Can you please stop?

625
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.851
Don't, please.

626
00:21:50.892 --> 00:21:51.685
Hey, hey.

627
00:21:51.727 --> 00:21:53.729
[whimsical music continues]

628
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:55.105
Whatever it takes.

629
00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:00.753
I mean, this isn't
rocket science.

630
00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.030
We, our sex has
become mechanical.

631
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:04.382
It's just, it's just
unsurprising.

632
00:22:04.406 --> 00:22:05.406
Okay.

633
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.536
So let's surprise each other.

634
00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:12.122
[mellow music]

635
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.382
[gnome clinks]

636
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:28.847
[Wendy] I'm just not the right
person to be giving sex advice.

637
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:29.890
I'm a serial monogamous.

638
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.060
Well, wasn't Tom into
some weird stuff?

639
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.329
Didn't you tell me
he was into like-

640
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:35.729
Furries, furries.

641
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:39.733
The giant animal costumes
that are used as mascots.

642
00:22:41.735 --> 00:22:43.278
So, okay.

643
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.906
So you would dress up
in the mascot costume

644
00:22:45.947 --> 00:22:47.532
- and have sex?
- No, God, no.

645
00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:48.408
No, no.

646
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.535
He was curious and he, you know,

647
00:22:50.577 --> 00:22:53.121
found some websites.

648
00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:56.124
I think that's as
far as it went.

649
00:22:56.166 --> 00:23:00.545
I just wanna do something,
like, surprising,

650
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:02.756
something he would never expect,

651
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:03.798
something,

652
00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.301
I don't know, like,

653
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:07.219
adventurous,

654
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.347
a little freaky but sexy, fun,

655
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:12.015
like, I don't know,

656
00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:14.643
like, like a sex swing.

657
00:23:14.935 --> 00:23:16.436
That's a thing, right?

658
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:17.478
A sex swing?

659
00:23:18.772 --> 00:23:20.500
I, I mean, I've never done
anything like that, that's...

660
00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:23.568
Or I don't know, like, um-

661
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.028
Like a, like a threesome.

662
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.198
A threesome?

663
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.366
Maybe or not.

664
00:23:30.617 --> 00:23:31.743
No, no, nevermind.

665
00:23:31.785 --> 00:23:32.887
- Forget about that.
- No, no, no, no, no.

666
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:33.703
It's a good idea.

667
00:23:33.745 --> 00:23:35.705
I've just, um...

668
00:23:35.747 --> 00:23:38.875
I don't know if we could
actually go through with that.

669
00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:40.627
Uh, 'cause who would...

670
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.297
Like, Marlon?

671
00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:49.302
No, obviously not Marlon.

672
00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:51.697
That would be a terrible
idea, Em.

673
00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:52.931
Yeah.

674
00:23:52.973 --> 00:23:56.184
A girl would make more
sense, probably.

675
00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:57.436
Marlon?

676
00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:00.272
You sure jumped to
Marlon pretty quickly.

677
00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.609
Are you thinking-

678
00:24:04.651 --> 00:24:06.194
What?

679
00:24:06.236 --> 00:24:07.236
Wait.

680
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.031
Okay. We trust each
other, so we have that.

681
00:24:10.073 --> 00:24:10.824
We're friends.

682
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:11.825
Whoa.

683
00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:12.867
I wasn't...

684
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:15.662
Oh, oh gosh.

685
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:17.497
Shit. [laughs]

686
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.539
Oh shit. No.

687
00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:22.419
- I am, I am so sorry.
- I am so...

688
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.753
No, no. Don't silly, no.

689
00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:24.504
I just, I just-

690
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:25.546
I mean, no.

691
00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.609
I just mean theoretically,
hypothetically speaking,

692
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:32.179
you would be the perfect
candidate if that...

693
00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.805
-Well, just, I mean-
-Yeah, why?

694
00:24:33.847 --> 00:24:36.016
Because with another girl
it would, it could be weird.

695
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.518
It, at least I know with you,

696
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.770
Josh is totally not your type.

697
00:24:40.812 --> 00:24:43.190
No, I suppose that's,
that's a good point.

698
00:24:43.231 --> 00:24:45.108
And, uh, like,

699
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.195
it's been a little while since
you've been with Tom, right?

700
00:24:48.236 --> 00:24:49.237
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:54.034
I have been a little
lonely, I guess.

702
00:24:54.075 --> 00:24:56.495
And you've been with
guys, you've...

703
00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:57.696
-Girls. -Yeah.

704
00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.874
Just not at the same time.

705
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:03.376
-Oh. -[Wendy] Yeah.

706
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:05.504
Forget it. I was joking.

707
00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:11.551
But it could be fine.

708
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.013
[whimsical music]

709
00:25:15.055 --> 00:25:16.515
- I mean, it's crazy.
- I mean, uh,

710
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.265
- it's totally crazy.
- [Wendy] Yeah.

711
00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:18.850
[Emma] Totally crazy.

712
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:19.892
But

713
00:25:21.102 --> 00:25:24.856
not completely, like,
stupid or gross or..

714
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.651
- You know?
- Are we doing this?

715
00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:28.818
- Are we?
- I don't know.

716
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:29.736
- [Emma] Okay.
- Are we?

717
00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:30.904
I don't know.

718
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:31.946
I mean...

719
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.201
Okay, how about this?

720
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.745
[both giggling]

721
00:25:38.787 --> 00:25:40.038
Okay.

722
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.415
Uh, come over for dinner.

723
00:25:42.457 --> 00:25:43.457
Yes.

724
00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.253
- Tonight.
- [Wendy] Okay.

725
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:49.005
Just dinner, like,
no expectations,

726
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.967
and we'll see what-

727
00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:53.717
Happens.

728
00:25:55.303 --> 00:25:56.303
Hey?

729
00:25:56.972 --> 00:25:58.265
Yeah.

730
00:25:58.306 --> 00:25:59.307
[Emma] Yeah.

731
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:01.935
Nope, no way.

732
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:02.811
- I can't do it.
- Oh my God.

733
00:26:02.852 --> 00:26:03.852
Can you relax?

734
00:26:04.437 --> 00:26:05.063
She might not even be into it.

735
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:06.356
We left it open.

736
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.525
Wait, you what?

737
00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.610
No, that, that's, that's worse.

738
00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.797
What, I gotta try and
like read her signs or s...

739
00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:14.507
I, I'm not gonna have
a clue what's going on.

740
00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:15.907
Oh my God.

741
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.284
I think I might have diarrhea.

742
00:26:17.325 --> 00:26:18.785
Do you feel like you
have diarrhea?

743
00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:20.036
No!

744
00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.205
I thought this was like
every man's fantasy.

745
00:26:22.247 --> 00:26:23.039
Oh, yeah, yeah.

746
00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.124
In, in theory.

747
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.501
Oh my gosh.

748
00:26:26.543 --> 00:26:28.521
I, I should be getting
a medal for this.

749
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:31.548
This is like me being the
best wife on the planet.

750
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.800
Sorry. It's just, it's,
it's too much pressure.

751
00:26:33.842 --> 00:26:34.968
Okay.

752
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.112
Well, you don't have
to worry about it

753
00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:37.804
because it's just dinner.

754
00:26:37.846 --> 00:26:39.723
She's probably come
to her senses.

755
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:40.932

[gentle music]

759
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:47.772
Do you have to go to the bathroo

760
00:26:47.814 --> 00:26:49.065
[Josh] I'm Good.

761
00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:51.818
[Emma] Are you
gonna stand like that?

762
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.860
I'm good.

763
00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:55.488
[door squeaks]

764
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:56.448
[Wendy] Hi.

765
00:26:56.489 --> 00:26:58.241
[Emma] Oh, thank you.

766
00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.492
Can I take your coat?

767
00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:00.845
[Wendy] Oh, um, can I
leave that on for now?

768
00:27:00.869 --> 00:27:02.346
[Emma] Oh yeah,
it's kind of cold.

769
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.498
Oh my gosh. Your
hair looks so good.

770
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.416
[Wendy] I worked hard on it.

771
00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.709
- Hi. Oh.
- Look at this.

772
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:08.585
Thank you so much.

773
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:09.878
- I love wine.
- So nice.

774
00:27:09.919 --> 00:27:12.380
So, Wendy, what's up?

775
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:13.423
What's up?

776
00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.425
Just, just, just
nervous. [chuckles]

777
00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.385
- Yeah.
- Just really nervous.

778
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.095
I feel like I might have-

779
00:27:19.137 --> 00:27:21.056
Diarrhea, right?

780
00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:23.307
[Wendy chuckles]

781
00:27:24.309 --> 00:27:26.311
Put on too much makeup
is what I was gonna say.

782
00:27:26.353 --> 00:27:27.354
-No. -No.

783
00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:28.438
- [Wendy] No?
- No.

784
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.790
- [Wendy] Okay.
- Your eyes look amazing.

785
00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.191
- [Wendy] Oh.
- Your skin.

786
00:27:31.232 --> 00:27:32.859
You look so pretty.

Thanks.

788
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:35.569
Um, so-

789
00:27:36.446 --> 00:27:37.446
Um, Emma,

790
00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:42.535
I should say something in
the spirit of full disclosure.

791
00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:43.577
Um...

792
00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:49.417
When we first met,
I... [chuckles]

793
00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:51.378
Oh my goodness.

794
00:27:51.419 --> 00:27:52.730
I'm so scared of
what this might be.

795
00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:54.482
Oh, it's nothing, it's
nothing, it's nothing.

796
00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.298
Okay.

797
00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.341
I just...

798
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:57.693
When we first met,
I kind of had a,

799
00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:58.802
a crush on you,

800
00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:01.805
- a little.
- Oh my gosh.

801
00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:05.558
I mean, come on,

802
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.393
who wouldn't?

803
00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:08.144
You're so confident

804
00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:09.813
and funny

805
00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:10.897
and sexy.

806
00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:12.899
Wow.

807
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:14.901
Oh my goodness.

808
00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:15.777
Thank you.

809
00:28:15.819 --> 00:28:18.238
I mean, you're sexy too.

810
00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:20.447
Huh.

811
00:28:21.908 --> 00:28:25.495
I, I know we said we weren't
gonna have any expectations

812
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:27.247
about tonight.

813
00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.416
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah, so...

814
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:38.925
But I really, really
wanna fuck you.

815
00:28:40.677 --> 00:28:41.553
Get her coat.

816
00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:42.137
Okay, I'm gonna take your coat.

-Emma? -Hmm?

834
00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:38.693
Do I have consent to
go down on you?

835
00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:40.487
Oh, yes.

836
00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:41.529

Okay.

I like the way you

854
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.399
I don't know what happened.

855
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.485
She, she just got
really intense.

Yeah, super intense.

857
00:31:03.987 --> 00:31:06.072
Ah, I knew this was a bad idea.

858

You knew it was a bad idea?

859
00:31:07.407 --> 00:31:08.199
What, is it my fault?

860
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.033
It's not my fault.

No, no, no, no.

862
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:11.536
Of course not. No.

863
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:12.912
Well, I mean, it seemed like it,

864
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:14.557
it was promising
at the beginning.

865
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:16.916
It seemed like, you know,

866
00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.085
something was happening.

867
00:31:19.127 --> 00:31:21.421
It seemed like you were into it.

00:31:25.925 --> 00:31:26.925
It was new, right?

872
00:31:27.969 --> 00:31:29.113
It was, it was, she was
very attractive and it was-

873
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.948
Yeah, she came to
the house in lingerie.

874
00:31:30.972 --> 00:31:32.616
- Of course she's attractive.
- I know. I know.

So, so what do we do now?

879
00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:42.650
Try something else.

880
00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:45.820
Just you do this
surprising this time.

[Josh] What's the
craziest thing, sexually,

893
00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.435
that you've ever done?

894
00:32:17.477 --> 00:32:18.603
Craziest thing I ever did?

895
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:19.979
[Josh] Yeah.

896
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:21.814
I fucked a dead girl once.

897
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:23.399
Oh my God. Really?

898
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.819
No, but I would if
she was super hot.

899
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.154
You know what? Forget it.

900
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.196
I'm sorry I asked.

901
00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.158
Oh and I went to a
swingers' party one time.

902
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.410
Everyone was having
sex everywhere.

903
00:32:34.452 --> 00:32:35.954
Yeah, it was dirty.

904
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:37.163
Sexy, though.

905
00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:38.205

Yeah.

910
00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.341
It's clever, right?

911
00:32:48.383 --> 00:32:51.010
I think it's, it's like
tongue in cheek.

912
00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:52.052
It's gross.

913
00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.640
This whole thing is gross.

914
00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:56.516
Ugh.

915
00:32:56.557 --> 00:32:57.684
Is there really nowhere else

916
00:32:57.725 --> 00:32:58.518
- we could go?
- Babe, babe,

917
00:32:58.559 --> 00:32:59.703
it's not like going for dim sum.

918
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.205
Okay? There's not a
lot of choice here.

919
00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:02.981
There's one sex club.

920
00:33:03.022 --> 00:33:03.815
This is it.

921
00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:04.732
Come on, let's go.

922
00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:06.067
This will be fun.

923
00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:09.862
[door slams]

924
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:11.489
[Emma groans]

925
00:33:11.531 --> 00:33:12.967
So you, uh, you don't
have like a daily,

926
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:15.201
like a guest pass available?

927
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:16.035
Okay.

928
00:33:16.077 --> 00:33:17.161
Okay then.

929
00:33:17.203 --> 00:33:19.414
I guess, um, two one
year memberships.

930
00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.166
Okay.

931
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:24.293
That'll be $300 each,

932
00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.171
plus a one-time
initiation fee of $50.

933
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:30.883
Oh, and there's a mandatory
$27 coat-check fee charge,

934
00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:31.968
and, of course,

935
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:32.802
- the cover charge.
- You know what?

936
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.137
I, I, I don't need to know.

937
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.346
Just, uh, run, run that.

938
00:33:35.388 --> 00:33:36.556
What, whatever you need.

939
00:33:36.597 --> 00:33:37.473
It's fine.

940
00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:41.019
[upbeat dance music]

941
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.896
[upbeat rock music]

942
00:33:58.578 --> 00:34:00.038
Could be worse.

943
00:34:00.079 --> 00:34:01.289
Yeah. No, no, no.

944
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.625
I think, uh, I think this
looks promising.

945

- [faint rock music]
- [signs buzzing]

946
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:24.771
Ex, excuse me.

947
00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:26.272
Oh.

948
00:34:26.313 --> 00:34:27.440
Oh.

949
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.900
Hi.

950
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.777
Uh, we're very flattered, um,

951
00:34:32.027 --> 00:34:33.905
but we're, we're not interested.

952
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:35.364
It's not, it's not you guys.

953
00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:37.199
We'd like some cheese.

954
00:34:38.493 --> 00:34:39.744
- Yeah, of course.
- Of course.

955
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:41.788
Help, help yourself.

956
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:44.706
He just wanted some cheese.

957
00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:45.748
Oh my God.

958
00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:47.793
- Okay.
- Maybe we should-

959
00:34:47.835 --> 00:34:48.835
No, no.

960
00:34:50.004 --> 00:34:50.922
So what are you two beautiful
people drinking tonight?

961
00:34:50.963 --> 00:34:53.132
-My God. -Finally.

962
00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:54.467
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi. Sorry.

963
00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:55.967
Thank you for breaking the ice.

964
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.637
We're a little nervous.

965
00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:59.097
[Emma] It's our first time.

966
00:34:59.138 --> 00:35:01.599
You've never ordered
a drink before?

967
00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:03.518
Don't worry, we
could take it slow.

968
00:35:03.559 --> 00:35:05.186
Ha. Thank you.

969
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.705
I'll have a tomato
juice, please.

970
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:07.647
Yeah, me too.

971
00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:08.648
Cool.

972
00:35:08.689 --> 00:35:10.233
Here's a tip.

973
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:14.779
Um, find the red curtain
for the higher end members.

974
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:17.073
I think you might get in.

975
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.032
- Thank you.
- The red...

976
00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:19.408
- A red curtain.
- Red curtain.

977
00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.869
[faint rock music]

978
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:22.745
[Emma] I think that
looks like a red curtain.

979
00:35:22.787 --> 00:35:24.997
That's definitely red curtain.

980
00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:26.707
Higher end.

981
00:35:26.749 --> 00:35:28.435
Should we tell her to bring
the tomato juice in there?

982
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.459
Is that...

983
00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:31.688
I mean, I'd feel bad if
we run into her later

984
00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:32.588
and she's been carrying
it around night.

985
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.339
[Emma] She knows we're high end.

986
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.674
What would we say to her?

987
00:35:34.715 --> 00:35:36.759
Uh, tell her, sorry,

988
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.261
"Our marriage is failing

989
00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:41.472
and the only way to save
it is to rekindle our sex life

990
00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:43.516
by getting our tomato juice
in the high end room."

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.817
- Oh, my God.
- Where?

[upbeat dance music]

995
00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:59.407
That's, hey.

[Arthur] The important thing
is to remember to have fun.

999
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.792
Do you hear that voice?

1000
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:10.853
- [Arthur] She's over there.
- [Emma] It's so familiar.

1001
00:36:10.877 --> 00:36:11.961
[Arthur] All ready for you.

1002
00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:12.837
There you go.

1003
00:36:12.879 --> 00:36:13.921
Just take your time.

1004
00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.298
Have fun.

1005
00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.424
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1006
00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.341
We need to go now.

1007
00:36:17.383 --> 00:36:18.009
- What?
- We need to leave now.

1008
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.885
Why?

1009
00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:19.802
Because-

1010
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.053
[Arthur] Emma?

1011
00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:25.516
[Emma] No.

1012
00:36:25.558 --> 00:36:26.559
I-

1013
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.227
No.

1014
00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:31.564
I, I didn't see your name
on any of the newsletters.

1015
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:32.440
Hey, Arthur.

1016
00:36:32.481 --> 00:36:34.066
-Hey, Josh. -Hi.

1017
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.335
Hey, have you heard
from the girls?

1018
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.903
Are they, are they
having fun at camp?

1019
00:36:36.944 --> 00:36:38.362
Nope, we haven't heard a peep.

1020
00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.484
But you know what they say.

1021
00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:40.823
When they're at camp,
no news is good news.

1022
00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.491
Yeah, yeah.

1023
00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:45.411
Um, are they taking
the bus home or are,

1024
00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:46.829
are you gonna pick them up?

1025
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.415
You know, I think picking
up is probably the best.

1026
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.559
It's part of the experience.

1027
00:36:50.583 --> 00:36:53.085
-Dad! What-
-Trust me.

1028
00:36:53.127 --> 00:36:56.005
I am way more
embarrassed than you are.

1029
00:36:56.047 --> 00:36:57.506
What makes you assume that?

1030
00:36:57.548 --> 00:36:59.300
Well, for one thing,

1031
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.679
this isn't real leather 'cause
you know how it s, stains.

1032
00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.097
It's really hard to...

1033
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:08.392
So, um, I had to use
vinyl and it, uh,

1034
00:37:08.434 --> 00:37:11.479
just doesn't work with
my, uh, character.

1035

Does Mom know?

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.774
- Oh, oh God.
- Does she?

is none of our business.

1038
00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.154
Okay, we're, we're not, we're
not gonna say a word to,

1039
00:37:20.196 --> 00:37:21.030
to Marge.

1040
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:21.864
We promise.

1041
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:22.740
Oh go ahead.

1042
00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:23.574
She's right over there.

[upbeat dance music]

Oh my God.

1045
00:37:27.745 --> 00:37:29.789
This is not happening.

1046
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:30.957
This is not happening.

1047
00:37:30.998 --> 00:37:34.126
Well, I g, I guess now
you know, um,

1048
00:37:35.503 --> 00:37:38.673
what we were doing when we
said we were playing Bridge

1049
00:37:38.714 --> 00:37:40.716
with the Wassermans.

1050
00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:41.926
To tell you the truth,

1051
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:43.278
we haven't actually seen
them since the '80s.

1052
00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:45.137
Oh my God. Dad!

1053
00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:46.764
Why are you acting so casual?

1054
00:37:46.806 --> 00:37:50.268
Is this not the most mortifying
experience of your life?

1055

[upbeat dance music continues]

1056
00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:52.812
I've had worse.

1057
00:37:52.853 --> 00:37:54.230
- Worse?
- [Arthur] Yeah.

1058
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:58.651
I don't know how we're
ever gonna talk again.

1059
00:37:58.693 --> 00:38:01.112
What, am I gonna come
over and bring the kids

1060
00:38:01.153 --> 00:38:03.322
and have lunch?
- [Arthur] What?

1061
00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:04.573
This is it. This is...

1062
00:38:04.615 --> 00:38:05.992
We have to part ways.

1063
00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:09.120
Just hang on there,
Judgey Judgerton.

1064
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:11.497
You've seen me naked
millions of times.

1065
00:38:11.539 --> 00:38:12.832
Not since I was six.

1066
00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:14.834
Emma, can we please talk?

1067
00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:15.751
Please, please? Huh?

1068
00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.795
Please, please.

1069
00:38:17.837 --> 00:38:18.713
Hi.

1070
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:19.964
Oh my God, Wendy,

1071
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.108
-what are you-
-I have not stopped

1072
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.425
thinking about last night.

1073
00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.801
Okay, I don't know

1074

- what you think happened.
- The fuck?

1075
00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.447
But something happened and
we need to talk about it alone,

1076

- just you and me.
- [Tom] Wendy,

1077
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:29.307
what's going on with you?

1078
00:38:29.348 --> 00:38:30.099
What are you doing here?

Don't, don't be Tom.

you followed me here?

That isn't a...

That is a blatant
violation of privacy.

00:38:40.776 --> 00:38:41.819
Uh, I'm sorry.

1087
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.046
Didn't you follow us
here, Wendy?

I followed Emma.

1089
00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:45.156
I'm sorry.

you away from me?

- Oh wait. Time out.
- [Tom] She doesn't even

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.953
- have a penis.
- I didn't steal anyone.

1094
00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.163
I'm not her girlfriend.

1095
00:38:52.204 --> 00:38:53.204
We broke up weeks ago.

1096
00:38:54.665 --> 00:38:56.893
And I told you I'm free to fornicate
with whomever I choose.

1097
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:58.210
Okay, wait.

1098
00:38:58.252 --> 00:38:59.378
This is the guy?

1099
00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.129
-Don't put your finger-
-This the one

1100
00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:00.796
you had a threesome with?

1101
00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:01.630
Whoa! No!

1102
00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:02.672
Excuse me.

1103
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:04.467
We didn't even touch
each other, that...

1104
00:39:04.508 --> 00:39:05.343
I swear to God, that was not...

1105
00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:06.802
You watched?

1106
00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:08.488
I'm gonna use my thumbs
to crush your eyes

1107
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.889
into their sockets!

1108
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:10.890
No!

1109
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.516
You back away from her.

1110
00:39:12.558 --> 00:39:13.558
Bubbles.

1111
00:39:14.393 --> 00:39:15.686
[Tom groans]

1112
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:17.229
Oh my God.

1113
00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.147
Go, get out of here.

1114
00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.023
Go, go.

1115
00:39:19.065 --> 00:39:20.566
Emma?

1116
00:39:20.608 --> 00:39:21.734
[Emma gasps]

1117
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:24.737
[upbeat dance music]

1118
00:39:25.946 --> 00:39:26.822
[Josh sighs]

1119
00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:27.948
[Emma] What was that?

1120
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.451
[Josh] Oh, no, that
was, that was crazy.

1121
00:39:30.493 --> 00:39:32.286
[Emma] That was my Dad!

1122
00:39:32.328 --> 00:39:33.454
Yeah, I know. I know.

1123
00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:34.973
Did you pick up on
what he was saying

1124
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:37.792
about us going up to camp
on Sunday to pick up the girls?

1125
00:39:37.833 --> 00:39:39.686
He's planning a surprise
anniversary party for us.

1126
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:40.586
- I know he is.
- [Emma] Josh-

1127
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:41.462
I know he is.

1128
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.964
We had issues before,

1129
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:46.300
but I don't know how
we're gonna process this.

1130
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:47.301
Your Dad? No.

1131
00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.177
Listen, it's...

1132
00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.219
I think it's good.

1133
00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:51.573
Your mom and dad have
an active sex life

1134
00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:51.931
- after all these years.
- And what have we done to Wendy?

1135
00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:52.973
We didn't...

1136
00:39:53.015 --> 00:39:53.682
Wait, that's...

1137
00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:55.101
Is that our fault?

1138
00:39:55.142 --> 00:39:56.936
I mean, she was a
relatively normal person

1139
00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:58.229
before last night.

1140
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.706
I just know before we
ran into your parents,

1141
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.941
I think things were,
were going okay, right?

1142
00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:03.275
There was stuff happening there.

1143
00:40:03.317 --> 00:40:05.069
Don't, don't you see?

1144
00:40:05.111 --> 00:40:07.238
Our plans keep getting
messed up by external forces.

1145
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:08.406
Last night it was Wendy,

1146
00:40:08.447 --> 00:40:10.282
tonight it was your dad.

1147
00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:12.284
We need something
that's just us.

1148
00:40:12.326 --> 00:40:13.452
Yes. Yes.

1149
00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:14.721
- Something private, right?
- Yeah.

1150
00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.455
Like, intimate.

1151
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:17.497
Yeah.

1152
00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.544
[Emma] Maybe we
should do ecstasy.

1153
00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:23.045
[Josh chuckles]

1154
00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.130
Yeah.

1155
00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:25.256
Right.

1156
00:40:25.297 --> 00:40:26.650
'Cause I'm so great
with the drugs.

1157
00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.485
You know, I get all
in my head and I...

1158
00:40:28.509 --> 00:40:29.509
it messes with me.

1159
00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:31.947
And there was the time
when we took the mushrooms

1160
00:40:31.971 --> 00:40:32.930
when we were camping
at Rolling River and I,

1161
00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:34.765
I got poison Ivy on my butt.

1162
00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:36.934
Yeah, because you
took off all your clothes

1163
00:40:36.976 --> 00:40:38.644
and you ran through
the forest naked.

1164
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.813
It was very freeing.

1165
00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.124
[Emma] Well, I don't
wanna be free.

1166
00:40:42.148 --> 00:40:43.333
I don't ever wanna
leave the house again

1167
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:44.275
after what I saw tonight.

1168
00:40:44.316 --> 00:40:45.109
Oh.

1169
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.151
Okay.

1170
00:40:47.403 --> 00:40:50.322
Okay. Let's, let's
try the ecstasy.

1171
00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:53.033
[faint upbeat dance music]

1172
00:40:53.075 --> 00:40:55.202
Do you know where
to get the ecstasy?

1173
00:40:57.371 --> 00:40:59.123
Like, where do you even-

1174
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:01.709
Like, at rave parties?

1175
00:41:02.877 --> 00:41:04.003
Let you into a rave party?

1176
00:41:04.044 --> 00:41:05.044
Like, a dark alley.

1177
00:41:06.088 --> 00:41:07.274
You're gonna have to get
it in an alley in the dark.

1178
00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.507
I got this.

1179
00:41:08.549 --> 00:41:10.759
[faint upbeat dance music]

1180
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:11.760
[car sputters and revs]

1181
00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:13.679
[whimsical music]

1182
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.181
How do you got it?

1183
00:41:15.222 --> 00:41:16.015
I got it.

1184
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:16.974
No, you don't.

1185
00:41:17.016 --> 00:41:17.850
I got this.

1186
00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:20.186
Okay. [chuckles]

1187
00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:24.190
[whimsical music continues]

1188
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:27.193
[indistinct chatter]

1189
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.198
Hey, yo, yo, you.

1190
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:33.616
You look shifty.

1191
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.950
No, I'm not. I'm not.

1192
00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.243
What do you want?

1193
00:41:36.285 --> 00:41:37.285
Uh, [clears throat]

1194
00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:40.348
I was wondering if, uh, if
you could, [clears throat]

1195
00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:42.666
score me some ec, ecs...

1196
00:41:42.708 --> 00:41:43.834
Are you a narc?

1197
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:45.211
What?

1198
00:41:45.252 --> 00:41:47.505
You sound like a really
bad narc from the '90s.

1199
00:41:47.546 --> 00:41:48.422
Why?

1200
00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:50.883
Did, did I, did I say it wrong?

1201
00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:55.554
Whatever.

1202
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:56.972
Can you hook me up?

1203
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:01.769
What makes you think I have it?

1204
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.020
What, I don't...

1205
00:42:03.062 --> 00:42:04.188
No, I don't know.

1206
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.415
'Cause you, you're
like a young person.

1207
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:06.232
You're like a, like a,

1208
00:42:06.273 --> 00:42:08.943
like a modern woman and you,

1209
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:11.403
you like to have a good time.

1210
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:12.863
What?

1211
00:42:12.905 --> 00:42:14.174
So you think I just
carry around MDMA

1212
00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:17.535
on my person at work
on a Thursday?

1213
00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:18.994
[whimsical music]

1214
00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.412
Ah God, no.

1215
00:42:20.454 --> 00:42:21.539
Ooh, fuck!

1216
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.373
When you say it like that,

1217
00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:23.666
I realize it was stupid.

1218
00:42:23.707 --> 00:42:24.750
Ah, I'm an idiot.

1219
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:27.253
I'm sorry, forget it.

1220
00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:30.506
- [Josh groans]
- [pills rattling]

1221
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.882
So what...

1222
00:42:31.924 --> 00:42:32.925
So all that then was,

1223
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:34.069
that was just you
busting my balls,

1224
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.261
like you torturing me

1225
00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:36.262
- for your amusement?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1226
00:42:36.303 --> 00:42:37.930
Your eyeballs were twitching.

1227
00:42:37.972 --> 00:42:40.015
It was gross, but
I kinda liked it.

1228
00:42:40.057 --> 00:42:41.350
Bye, Natasha.

1229
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:42.392
Bye, Keanu.

1230
00:42:44.186 --> 00:42:45.771
Okay.

1231
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:47.731
- Shading.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

1232
00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:49.000
-Shading. -Yeah.

1233
00:42:49.024 --> 00:42:50.192
See tomorrow.

1234
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:55.281
I'm sad because you said
you'd come by the gallery

1235
00:42:55.322 --> 00:42:56.240
and you never came.

1236
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:57.575
Oh shit.

1237
00:42:57.616 --> 00:42:59.159
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

1238
00:42:59.201 --> 00:43:00.804
I just, things have
been kind of crazy with-

1239
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.079
Okay, that's enough small talk.

1240
00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:03.747
I mostly came back for these.

1241
00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:07.167
I want these in my gallery now.

1242
00:43:07.209 --> 00:43:09.169
The artist I was showing
came by the gallery today

1243
00:43:09.211 --> 00:43:12.006
and saw that I, I took
down his scrotums.

1244
00:43:12.047 --> 00:43:13.775
He wasn't happy so
he pulled everything,

1245
00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.175
now my gallery's empty.

1246
00:43:15.217 --> 00:43:16.653
I desperately need
something to show.

1247
00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:17.595
I...

1248
00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:18.429
You'd be saving my ass.

1249
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.389
Wait, are you kidding?

1250
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:21.557
You're serious?

1251
00:43:22.516 --> 00:43:24.977
I, I mean, this is incredible.

1252
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.479
I, I'd have to check
with the Aisha,

1253
00:43:27.521 --> 00:43:29.231
but I'm sure she'd be thrilled.

1254
00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.608
Yes.

1255
00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:31.649
Oh my God.

1256
00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.170
You have no idea what kind of
impact this could have on her.

1257
00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:35.194
Okay.

1258
00:43:36.196 --> 00:43:37.299
We'll bring them by tomorrow

1259
00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:40.075
and I'll use as
many as I can fit.

1260
00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.785
You're serious?

1261
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:42.827
Oh my God.

1262
00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:45.497
Hello.

1263
00:43:45.539 --> 00:43:46.999
Yeah, no, I, I understand.

1264
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.917
I had a, an epiphany, though.

1265
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.377
Open Saturday.

1266
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:51.462
No, no balls.

1267
00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:52.546
She's a child.

1268
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.885
Is all the water
really necessary?

1269
00:43:57.926 --> 00:43:58.802
Well, yeah,

1270
00:43:58.844 --> 00:44:00.012
if you don't want to die

1271
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.014
because I read that
most MDMA related deaths

1272
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.349
are caused by dehydration.

1273
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.184
So if we're all splayed
out on the floor,

1274
00:44:05.225 --> 00:44:06.352
all whacked out on drugs,

1275
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:07.227
and we can't make it to the-

1276
00:44:07.269 --> 00:44:08.228
You're kind of ruining the fun.

1277
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:09.021
Oh, okay, fine.

1278
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.022
Okay.

1279
00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.148
Okay.

1280
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:12.190
Sorry.

1281
00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:14.610
[Josh exhales deeply]

1282
00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:15.819
There, you see that?

1283
00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:17.071
You see how quickly I forgot

1284
00:44:17.112 --> 00:44:18.197
everything that I've read

1285
00:44:18.238 --> 00:44:20.407
about how ecstasy
depletes spinal fluid

1286
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:21.158
and increases the-

1287
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.200
Shh.

1288
00:44:25.746 --> 00:44:26.746
Thank you.

1289
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.375
All right.

1290
00:44:29.416 --> 00:44:30.668
Here, here. Cheers.

1291
00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.628
[Emma chuckles]

1292
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.462
Cheers.

1293
00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:34.504
Good luck.

1294
00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:37.383
Oh shit. Water.

1295
00:44:47.267 --> 00:44:49.395
[gentle music]

1296
00:44:49.436 --> 00:44:50.437
How about now?

1297
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:53.857
Yeah, yeah, no, I think I'm,

1298
00:44:53.899 --> 00:44:54.900
I'm feeling som...

1299
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.419
I'm starting to feel
something, you?

1300
00:44:56.443 --> 00:44:58.862
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I feel something.

1301
00:44:58.904 --> 00:44:59.780
I think it's working.

1302
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:00.822
Yeah.

1303
00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:05.619
Can you believe we thought
that was it back on the couch?

1304
00:45:05.661 --> 00:45:06.537
Oh my gosh.

1305
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:07.413
I feel like we're...

1306
00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:08.473
We were not high at the house.

1307
00:45:08.497 --> 00:45:09.456
Oh God.

1308
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:11.834
And this whole sex thing.

1309
00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:14.670
I mean, we, we feel fine.

1310
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:16.004
We'll figure it out.

1311
00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.005
We're not gonna
like sell our house

1312
00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:18.257
and traumatize our kids.

1313
00:45:18.298 --> 00:45:19.859
- Oh my God.
- We're not gonna wake up and,

1314
00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.427
like, hate each other.

1315
00:45:21.468 --> 00:45:22.553
That's not who we are.

1316
00:45:22.594 --> 00:45:23.822
Oh God, I feel really
good right now.

1317
00:45:23.846 --> 00:45:24.680
[Josh] We're so good
at figuring things out.

1318
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:25.722
-I feel-
-Like, I know.

1319
00:45:26.557 --> 00:45:27.826
[Emma] I feel like I
could do anything.

1320
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:28.976
Oh my God.

1321
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:29.685
- Whoa!
- [Emma] I feel like

1322
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.019
we could do anything.

1323
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.373
-I feel like everything's,
alive -You know what?

1324
00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:36.442
We just made everything so
unnecessarily complicated.

1325
00:45:36.483 --> 00:45:38.628
Don't you feel like we're too
serious about the sex stuff?

1326
00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:40.088
When we were in
university, we just had...

1327
00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.112
We fucked everywhere.

1328
00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:42.740
- We, like, had sex in my car.
- And my parents!

1329
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:43.449
Oh my God, my parents-

1330
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.783
[overlapping chatter]

1331
00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:46.452
Or when they were sleeping.

1332
00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:47.762
We'd pretend you
were a girl guide

1333
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:49.246
and that I was a hunter-

1334
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:51.081
[indistinct chatter]

1335
00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.624
Oh, yeah, and the kissing.

1336
00:45:52.666 --> 00:45:53.768
Oh, yeah, we kissed
all the time.

1337
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:55.210
Oh God, and your dick.

1338
00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:56.628
You, I used to love-

1339
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.130
You always said you
enjoyed my penis.

1340
00:45:58.172 --> 00:45:59.423
Even though it wasn't huge.

1341
00:45:59.465 --> 00:46:01.425
I, I have a slim vagina, right?

1342
00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:02.468
You have the slimmest-

1343
00:46:02.509 --> 00:46:03.302
[indistinct chatter]

1344
00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:04.094
You have the slimmest vagina

1345
00:46:04.136 --> 00:46:05.136
of anyone I've ever seen.

1346
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:06.948
[Emma] I know, it
was a perfect fit.

1347
00:46:06.972 --> 00:46:08.408
It was like puzzle
pieces that fit together.

1348
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.224
I wanna kiss you.

1349
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.434
I wanna kiss you.

1350
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:12.561
[indistinct chatter]

1351
00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:13.437
Oh my God.

1352
00:46:13.479 --> 00:46:14.271
Oh my God, your tongue-

1353
00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:15.898
It's my winter mint gum.

1354
00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:18.358
[funky music]

1355
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.698
[Josh groaning]

1356
00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.365
[music stops]

1357
00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:27.034
[Emma panting]

1358
00:46:27.075 --> 00:46:28.075
[Josh grunting]

1359
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.037
What?

1360
00:46:32.206 --> 00:46:33.081
Are you done?

1361
00:46:33.123 --> 00:46:34.082
I can't believe I just did that.

1362
00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.042
Oh my God.

1363
00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:37.503
[Josh moaning]

1364
00:46:41.799 --> 00:46:43.467
[both chuckling]

1365
00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:44.509
It's okay.

1366
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.655
We could just recharge
the batteries.

1367
00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:49.181
No, like, I...

1368
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:50.700
Everything I read
said, you know,

1369
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:52.494
there's erectile
dysfunction issues on ectasy.

1370
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:53.870
I mean, we were lucky
to get one erection.

1371
00:46:53.894 --> 00:46:55.354
We're, we're not gonna get two.

1372
00:46:55.395 --> 00:46:56.313
I'm sure we can try.

1373
00:46:56.355 --> 00:46:57.523
No, please don't do that.

1374
00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.000
- Please don't, don't, don't.
- Okay, sorry.

1375
00:46:59.024 --> 00:46:59.983
[Josh] Just don't.

1376
00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:00.776
Just don't think about it.

1377
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:01.610
Just...

1378
00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:02.861
I'll, I'll wait.

1379
00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:07.616
It's fine.

1380
00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:08.742
I'm really sorry.

1381
00:47:08.784 --> 00:47:10.369
Oh no. Please don't apologize.

1382
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:11.410
Oh really?

1383
00:47:12.746 --> 00:47:14.915
So you're not, like, totally
frustrated right now.

1384
00:47:14.957 --> 00:47:16.375
No.

1385
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.001
I mean, I'm a little frustrated.

1386
00:47:18.043 --> 00:47:18.961
Oh my God, you are frustrated.

1387
00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:19.837
I knew, I knew this.

1388
00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:21.547
I fucked the whole thing up.

1389
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.591
We can still do this.

1390
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:26.110
No that's, that's pressuring
me. You're...

1391
00:47:26.134 --> 00:47:27.344
That's putting pressure on me,

1392
00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:28.822
and I don't function
well under pressure.

1393
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:29.846
You know I, I don't-

1394
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.891
I can't stop thinking about
that comment you made earlier

1395
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:33.933
about my penis.

1396
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.728
When I complimented it?

1397
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:38.856
Uh, by calling it not
huge. [gasps]

1398
00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:39.731
Oh my God.

1399
00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:40.834
-What? -Oh no, no.

1400
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:41.692
- I'm leaking.
- What?

1401
00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:44.570
[Josh] I'm leaking spinal fluid.

1402
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:45.821
It's semen.

1403
00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:46.864
Oh, I don't feel right.

1404
00:47:46.905 --> 00:47:48.198
[Emma] It's not spinal fluid.

1405
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.032
I don't, I, I, I...

1406
00:47:49.074 --> 00:47:50.242
My head hurts and I, I,

1407
00:47:50.284 --> 00:47:51.594
I'm having, like,
fucking back spasms.

1408
00:47:51.618 --> 00:47:53.036
Okay. Can you just calm down?

1409
00:47:53.078 --> 00:47:55.098
We're not the couple that
yells at each other, okay?

1410
00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.081
Right.

1411
00:47:56.123 --> 00:47:57.249
[Emma] Just calm down.

1412
00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.877
When we have a
problem, we fix it.

1413
00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:01.795
- Yeah.
- Or we compromise.

1414
00:48:03.422 --> 00:48:04.590
I know what that is.

1415
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:06.025
I know what, I know
what you're doing there.

1416
00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:07.777
If you wanna say
something, just say it to me.

1417
00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.153
And when you say that,
it's like you're saying...

1418
00:48:09.177 --> 00:48:10.217
I know what you're saying.

1419
00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:11.638
It's like you think that
you're the only one of us

1420
00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.347
who compromises.

1421
00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:13.265
That's not what I meant.

1422
00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:14.725
-Mm-hmm. -Okay?

1423
00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:17.060
But maybe we should
stop playing games.

1424
00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:19.438
Maybe we should
just speak our mind.

1425
00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:20.439
Great, you want me
to speak my mind,

1426
00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.480
fuck I'ma speak my mind.

1427
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.025
Calmly!

1428
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.109
I'm gonna speak my f...

1429
00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.004
My I'm losing fucking
my mind, Em.

1430
00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.322
I'm losing it because
the kids are coming home

1431
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:30.324
from camp and then,

1432
00:48:30.365 --> 00:48:33.285
then we're, we're back to,
like, our normal routine.

1433
00:48:33.327 --> 00:48:35.746
And then, then this was
our one chance, you know,

1434
00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:37.956
our one chance to prove
that we could do this,

1435
00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.434
that we're not, I don't
know, what, like,

1436
00:48:39.458 --> 00:48:40.768
sexually incompatible
or something.

1437
00:48:40.792 --> 00:48:42.669
You think I'm not terrified?

1438
00:48:42.711 --> 00:48:44.796
You think I'm not
lying in bed at night

1439
00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:46.632
worried about why
we're not fucking,

1440
00:48:46.673 --> 00:48:48.926
that we're gonna end up
like Andrew and Janice

1441
00:48:48.967 --> 00:48:50.802
in the goddamn grocery store?

1442
00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.056
You think this is just you?

1443
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.686
Do you not see that my heart

1444
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.399
is breaking just a little
more every single day?

1445
00:49:09.321 --> 00:49:12.574
We're great parents
together, right?

1446
00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:15.535
And we, we got the
friendship thing down.

1447
00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:16.578
It's just...

1448
00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.331
It's this one piece that we...

1449
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:20.791
I don't know.

1450
00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:23.794
I mean, I think maybe
we made a mistake.

1451
00:49:27.547 --> 00:49:28.507
[sniffles]

1452
00:49:28.548 --> 00:49:30.425
Yeah, maybe we did [sniffles].

1453
00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:32.678
- Yep.
- Wait, what are you...

1454
00:49:32.719 --> 00:49:34.638
What are you doing?

1455
00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.616
What, what are you,
what are you doing?

1456
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.432
I don't know.

1457
00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:38.474
I just gotta

1458
00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:41.395
clear my head,

1459
00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:42.187
get my thoughts together.

1460
00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:43.271
I'm gonna go to a hotel.

1461
00:49:43.313 --> 00:49:44.398
You're gon-

1462
00:49:44.439 --> 00:49:45.273
What are...

1463
00:49:45.315 --> 00:49:46.692
You're gonna what? Wh, why, why?

1464
00:49:47.067 --> 00:49:48.193
Why? Why?

1465
00:49:48.235 --> 00:49:49.194
I don't know.

1466
00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.028
I don't know what
the fuck to do.

1467
00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:50.904
I don't know.

1468
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:52.066
I don't think we're gonna...

1469
00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:54.074
I don't think we're gonna
get anywhere here tonight

1470
00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:56.368
with both of us

1471
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:01.748
just confused and paranoid.

1472
00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.625
Paran, paranoid?

1473
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.543
Is that what you think?

1474
00:50:04.584 --> 00:50:05.377
You're talking about me, right?

1475
00:50:05.419 --> 00:50:06.562
You said we, but you meant me.

1476
00:50:06.586 --> 00:50:07.462
You think that I'm
being paranoid?

1477
00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:09.506
Is that what you're saying?

1478
00:50:09.548 --> 00:50:11.049
Please don't go, okay?

1479
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:12.217
There was a mis...

1480
00:50:12.259 --> 00:50:14.553
We, we're not the
couple that does that.

1481
00:50:14.594 --> 00:50:16.138
We don't, like, walk
out on each other

1482
00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:16.888
in the middle of a fight.

1483
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.056
No, we're not, we're not,

1484
00:50:18.098 --> 00:50:19.975
we're not the couple
who invites their friend

1485
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.560
to a fucking threesome.

1486
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:25.063
And we're not the couple
who take ecstasy

1487
00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:26.481
- to try and have sex.
- I know.

1488
00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:29.901
[Emma] Or have crushes on people

1489
00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:32.404
the week we're supposed to have-

1490
00:50:33.447 --> 00:50:34.239
- Wait.
- [Emma] You know, like,

1491
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:36.033
- to have sex.
- I'm sorry.

1492
00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:38.201
Did you just say cru,
that we have crushes?

1493
00:50:38.243 --> 00:50:39.243
I'm, I don't...

1494
00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.079
-I'm, I don't, I don't-
-No, it's nothing.

1495
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:43.248
It's just a stupid
fucking crush.

1496
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:46.752
It's just this timing that
obviously is saying something.

1497
00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.795
It's just freaking me out.

1498
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:51.131
[Josh] Whoa.

1499
00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:52.174
Who is it?

1500
00:50:56.094 --> 00:50:57.220
It's Marlon.

1501
00:50:57.262 --> 00:50:58.430
Marlon?

1502
00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.265
Marlon from art school?

1503
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:01.725
Marlon, the gallery thingy guy?

1504
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.393
Yes. It's stupid.

1505
00:51:03.435 --> 00:51:04.936
Oh, okay.

1506
00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:05.771
So what?

1507
00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:07.606
You guys, all week,

1508
00:51:07.647 --> 00:51:10.025
you guys have been,
like, flirting and stuff?

1509
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:11.860
No.

1510
00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.902
I mean,

1511
00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:14.904
a little,

1512
00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:17.949
maybe.

1513
00:51:17.991 --> 00:51:19.618
Okay.

1514
00:51:19.659 --> 00:51:21.203
Can I get some details on that,

1515
00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.623
just, like, details about
what that means?

1516
00:51:24.664 --> 00:51:26.958
No, 'cause that's
a really bad idea.

1517
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.311
Mm, I think it's actually
a really good idea

1518
00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:29.211
'cause I need to hear it.

1519
00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.545
And you just said

1520
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:31.981
- you have a crush on Marlon.
- Well, I don't know

1521
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:32.756
what you're gonna hear
'cause there's also no details.

1522
00:51:32.798 --> 00:51:33.632
-I had-
-[Josh] Okay.

1523
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:34.633
- You want the details?
- Yes.

1524
00:51:34.674 --> 00:51:38.512
I had a, a daydream about him.

1525
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:41.014
- [Josh] A daydream?
- That's it.

1526
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.766
Is that like...

1527
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:45.769
Is that code for, like,
a sex fantasy?

1528
00:51:47.479 --> 00:51:48.479
Uh.

1529
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:50.315
Yeah, I guess.

1530
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:51.608
I guess that's what it is.

1531
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:52.877
-Wow. -[Emma] Yeah.

1532
00:51:52.901 --> 00:51:53.985
Wow. Okay.

1533
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.320
-So... Now you know.

1534
00:51:55.362 --> 00:51:58.740
In this, like, fantasy
did he, like, kiss you?

1535
00:52:00.659 --> 00:52:01.952
In the fantasy?

1536
00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:03.846
[Josh] Yeah, inside the
fantasy, did he kiss you?

1537
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.123
- Yes. He did.
- Wow.

1538
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.165
Right.

1539
00:52:07.207 --> 00:52:08.750
Like, was it like a very...

1540
00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:12.003
Like a, tonguey, hot kiss?

1541
00:52:13.505 --> 00:52:15.006
Well, it was in a fantasy,

1542
00:52:15.048 --> 00:52:16.842
-so it was like a-
-[Josh] Yeah.

1543
00:52:16.883 --> 00:52:18.163
-You know-
-[Josh] It's probably-

1544
00:52:18.677 --> 00:52:19.594
-My fantasy... Yeah,
your fantasy kiss.

1545
00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:20.679
It was a pretty hot kiss.

1546
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.638
With Marlon.

1547
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.514
And what else did he do to,

1548
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:25.183
did he do to you in the fantasy?

1549
00:52:25.225 --> 00:52:26.369
I don't think you really
wanna know this.

1550
00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:27.853
No, I definitely wanna know.

1551
00:52:27.894 --> 00:52:28.645
And I want you to tell me.

1552
00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:29.437
I just want to know.

1553
00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.689
It's cool.

1554
00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:31.690
Just tell me what he did
to you in the fantasy.

1555
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:32.792
What he did to me
in the fantasy-

1556
00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:33.936
- [Josh] Yes, yeah.
- He, uh,

1557
00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:38.321
he lifted me up on the desk
and he took my panties off.

1558
00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:40.448
-Uh, they were much
nicer... Okay, uh.

1559
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.218
- No, you're right.
- Than I was actually wearing.

1560
00:52:42.242 --> 00:52:43.636
- You're right.
- [Emma] And then he came

1561
00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.578
-and he-
-That's good.

1562
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:45.495
Stop it!

1563
00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:46.329
It's good, it's good.

1564
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:47.205
I get it. You're right.

1565
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:48.790
That was a really bad idea.

1566
00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.041
And,

1567
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.588
and you were right

1568
00:52:54.629 --> 00:52:56.190
that we are not gonna
figure this out tonight.

1569
00:52:56.214 --> 00:52:57.924
-Josh. -No.

1570
00:52:57.966 --> 00:52:59.766
And you were right that
we need space, so I'm-

1571
00:52:59.801 --> 00:53:00.677
[Emma] Oh my God.

1572
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:01.887
I'm giving us some space.

1573
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:03.638
Where are you going?

1574
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:05.849
Josh?

1575
00:53:05.891 --> 00:53:08.226
[pensive music]

1576
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.230
[door slams]

1577
00:53:16.651 --> 00:53:17.903
Fucking gnomes!

1578
00:53:23.283 --> 00:53:24.603
- [Josh groans]
- [gnome shatters]

1579
00:53:24.784 --> 00:53:28.163
[pensive music continues]

1580
00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:43.970
[Emma sniffling]

1581
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.516
[Kelly chuckles]

1582
00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:49.558
Oh dude.

1583
00:53:50.477 --> 00:53:53.146
You partied on a school
night, wow.

1584
00:53:54.314 --> 00:53:56.107
Oh, you look really creepy.

1585
00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:57.442
You look super fucking sketchy.

1586
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.003
It's, it's actually
really embarrassing.

1587
00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:02.113
Hey, Josh, I need you to
clean that up and go home.

1588
00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:04.074
[Josh groans]

1589
00:54:04.115 --> 00:54:06.409
Yeah, well, there it is,

1590
00:54:06.826 --> 00:54:09.246
the fog of the morning after.

1591
00:54:09.287 --> 00:54:10.747
You know, I should
have warned you.

1592
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:12.892
That's what happens when you
have an evening of euphoria

1593
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:13.959
and crazy sex.

1594
00:54:15.502 --> 00:54:16.938
Would you, would you
stop with the sex?

1595
00:54:16.962 --> 00:54:18.630
There was no sex, okay?

1596
00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.672
Emma and I,

1597
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:21.984
we took the ectasy
because our relationship

1598
00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:23.527
is falling apart because
our sex life is in shambles.

1599
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:24.344
All right?

1600
00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:26.388
There, I said it.

1601
00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.429
Oh.

1602
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:30.642
Okay.

1603
00:54:30.684 --> 00:54:32.978
Uh, well, first of all,
it's called "molly".

1604
00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:34.229
When you say the ecstasy,

1605
00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:36.064
it's very embarrassing
for both of us.

1606
00:54:36.106 --> 00:54:37.816
And I'm guessing it's
still in your system

1607
00:54:37.857 --> 00:54:38.918
'cause it's doing something

1608
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:42.237
that was surprisingly,
uh, honest.

1609
00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:43.279
I'm sorry.

1610
00:54:44.197 --> 00:54:45.758
Come on, tell me what
happened last night.

1611
00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:48.159
[indistinct chatter]

1612
00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:49.744
Okay.

1613
00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:52.414
It was, [clears throat]
it was really bad.

1614
00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.455
It was a disaster.

1615
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:56.352
She told me that she has a
crush on this old flame of hers.

1616
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:57.168
Okay.

1617
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.211
That's totally normal.

1618
00:54:58.253 --> 00:54:59.629
People have crushes
all the time.

1619
00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:00.982
Yeah, but she's been
working with the guy all week

1620
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:02.191
and now she's worried that
she's gonna maybe, like,

1621
00:55:02.215 --> 00:55:04.676
do it with him or something.

1622
00:55:04.718 --> 00:55:05.844
Oh.

1623
00:55:05.885 --> 00:55:07.445
I spent the night at a
dingy motel room.

1624
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.014
Yeah.

1625
00:55:09.055 --> 00:55:10.390
That's pretty fucking tragic.

1626
00:55:10.432 --> 00:55:11.474
Yeah.

1627
00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:13.685
It's the first time
since I met her

1628
00:55:13.727 --> 00:55:16.563
that I just have no clue
what's going on in her head.

1629
00:55:16.604 --> 00:55:17.604
Yeah.

1630
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:21.359
Well, you should probably
do something about that.

1631
00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:22.861
I know.

1632
00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:24.862
That, that, that's
what I was thinking.

1633
00:55:24.904 --> 00:55:26.132
Yeah, maybe like a romantic
gesture or something.

1634
00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:28.533
Hey, you, you think I
should make her jealous?

1635
00:55:28.575 --> 00:55:30.553
Uh, no, I don't think
you should do that.

1636
00:55:30.577 --> 00:55:32.054
Yeah, because she's
never been jealous before.

1637
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:33.347
She's not really
the jealous type,

1638
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:34.890
that's just because I've
never posed a threat.

1639
00:55:34.914 --> 00:55:36.392
Okay, what you're
suggesting is juvenile,

1640
00:55:36.416 --> 00:55:38.209
manipulative and mean-spirited.

1641
00:55:38.251 --> 00:55:39.044
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1642
00:55:39.085 --> 00:55:40.045
It's gonna work [claps].

1643
00:55:40.086 --> 00:55:41.546
No, look, I happen
to be a master

1644
00:55:41.588 --> 00:55:43.173
at romantic manipulation, okay?

1645
00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:44.049
I am not proud of it.

1646
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.192
Oh my God, I am so proud of it.

1647
00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:46.301
I'm just kidding.

1648
00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.010
-And what is... I
know what I'm saying

1649
00:55:47.052 --> 00:55:48.052
sounds totally crazy.

1650
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:49.989
I recognize this is an
unconventional approach.

1651
00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:50.972
It sounds crazy coming
outta my mouth.

1652
00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:52.199
What are you doing
with that phone?

1653
00:55:52.223 --> 00:55:53.743
But I really think thi,
this is gonna work

1654
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.477
because I feel her
slipping away, you know?

1655
00:55:55.518 --> 00:55:57.204
And I gotta do whatever it
takes to get her back, right?

1656
00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:58.146
It doesn't make me a bad per...

1657
00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.332
Does that make me a bad person?

1658
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:01.000
-It doesn't make you a
bad... Oh my God.

1659
00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.067
Josh, Josh, listen to me!

1660
00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:04.361
Every single person
born after 1990

1661
00:56:04.402 --> 00:56:05.737
is trained in these very arts,

1662
00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:06.738
the art of Tinder.

1663
00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.614
Please just put the phone down.

1664
00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:08.490
Put it down.

1665
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.324
Hang up the phone.

1666
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:11.701
[phone ringing]

1667
00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:13.119
I need you to do this for me.

1668
00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:14.412
What? No,

1669
00:56:14.454 --> 00:56:15.413
Uh-uh, I'm not
touching that phone.

1670
00:56:15.455 --> 00:56:16.455
Nope.

1671
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:17.832
- I think it looks really good.
- [phone ringing]

1672
00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:18.500
Yeah.

1673
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.417
[indistinct chatter]

1674
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:20.251
I'm sorry, just one second.

1675
00:56:20.293 --> 00:56:21.419
[heels clicking]

1676
00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.630
Thank God you called.

1677
00:56:23.671 --> 00:56:25.090
Look, I don't wanna-

1678
00:56:25.131 --> 00:56:26.466
Oh, hello?

1679
00:56:26.508 --> 00:56:27.801
Oh, sorry.

1680
00:56:27.842 --> 00:56:29.302
Who is this?

1681
00:56:29.344 --> 00:56:31.137
This is Emma.

1682
00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:32.472
Who's this?

1683
00:56:32.514 --> 00:56:33.306
Oh geez.

1684
00:56:33.348 --> 00:56:34.348
I'm so sorry.

1685
00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:37.495
I think I might have ass
dialed you on Josh's phone.

1686
00:56:37.519 --> 00:56:38.603
Who is this?

1687
00:56:39.813 --> 00:56:42.607
It's Kelly from Josh's
work. [giggling]

1688
00:56:42.649 --> 00:56:44.692
Josh, oh my gosh, come here.

1689
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.587
I think I might have ass
dialed Emma on your phone.

1690
00:56:46.611 --> 00:56:48.613
I'm so sorry. [giggling]

1691
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:50.698
I'm such a dumb slut sometimes.

1692
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.117
That's good. That's good.

1693
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:54.452
Hey, sorry about that.

1694
00:56:54.494 --> 00:56:55.620
Hey.

1695
00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:56.662
Um,

1696
00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:02.544
how are you feeling
after last night?

1697
00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.379
Uh, I don't know.

1698
00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:06.631
I've been better.

1699
00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.216
What I said about Marlon-

1700
00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.258
[Josh sighs]

1701
00:57:10.301 --> 00:57:11.052
Just, I, I really don't
wanna hear about Marlon

1702
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:11.636
- right now, okay?
- I know.

1703
00:57:11.678 --> 00:57:13.012
I'm sorry.

1704
00:57:13.054 --> 00:57:14.281
-I... It was a mistake.

1705
00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:15.408
I, I didn't mean to call you.

1706
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.933
I, uh, I gotta go.

1707
00:57:16.975 --> 00:57:17.975
Um,

1708
00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:21.187
we're just gonna go
grab some dinner.

1709
00:57:21.229 --> 00:57:23.440
Oh, okay.

1710
00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:25.692
You, you have dinner plans?

1711
00:57:25.733 --> 00:57:30.363
It's like a private work
thing, so, uh...

1712
00:57:30.655 --> 00:57:32.949
Anyway, I gotta go.

1713
00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:33.991
Bye.

1714
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.831
Well, that's done.

1715
00:57:45.879 --> 00:57:46.880
I feel dirty.

1716
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.925
What did I just do?

1717
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.528
I believe my words
were mean-spirited,

1718
00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:53.928
juvenile and manipulative.

1719
00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.930
How could you let me do that?

1720
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.308
I, I actually warned you.

1721
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:59.184
I have a gift.

1722
00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:00.286
It's guided by a higher power,

1723
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.110
there's nothing I
can do about it.

1724
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:04.731
The situation is 100% on you.

1725
00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.651
[Josh sighs]

1726
00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:14.782
Like, it's, it's looking
pretty good, right?

1727
00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:17.160
I mean, we can come
back tomorrow

1728
00:58:17.202 --> 00:58:19.096
and make some last minute
adjustments if we want to.

1729
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.996
But I don't know.

1730
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:21.706
I think we're pretty much...

1731
00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:23.082
We're ready to go.

1732
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.337
You got any dinner plans?

1733
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:29.923
You know I'm married, right?

1734
00:58:29.964 --> 00:58:31.799
So what the fuck is
wrong with you?

1735
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:35.887
I, I, I thought the three of
us could grab some dinner,

1736
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:39.015
you, me and Josh, if you
don't already have plans,

1737
00:58:39.057 --> 00:58:41.809
But, uh, really, forget it.

1738
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:44.062
- I'm, I'm, I'm sorry.
- No.

1739
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:45.855
You know what?

1740
00:58:45.897 --> 00:58:47.374
I don't even want to
have dinner with you,

1741
00:58:47.398 --> 00:58:49.817
with either of you
'cause I, I hate dinner.

1742
00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.695
I uh, totally was, was joking.

1743
00:58:52.737 --> 00:58:55.406
I don't even eat, so that's...

1744
00:58:55.448 --> 00:58:56.592
Whatever I did, I
didn't mean it.

1745
00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:57.575
I'm truly sorry.

1746
00:58:57.617 --> 00:58:59.661
And please don't be mad at me.

1747
00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:00.537
[Emma sighs]

1748
00:59:00.578 --> 00:59:01.746
No, it's not you.

1749
00:59:01.788 --> 00:59:04.582
I'm really sorry. [sniffles]

1750
00:59:04.624 --> 00:59:07.210
I just made everything
really awkward.

1751
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:10.004
Well, welcome to my world.

1752
00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:13.341
The, the world of
awkward, awkward world,

1753
00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:15.093
the wonderful world of awkward.

1754
00:59:15.134 --> 00:59:16.177
Just stop.

1755
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:18.513
Look, Josh and I just have...

1756
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.157
We're just going through
something right now,

1757
00:59:20.181 --> 00:59:22.934
so we can't go for dinner.

1758
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.813
It's just we've always been
able to talk it through,

1759
00:59:26.854 --> 00:59:28.189
always.

1760
00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:30.358
Yeah, I believe it.

1761
00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.859
Are you gonna eat that?

1762
00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:34.779
And, but I, I s...

1763
00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:36.239
I screwed up.

1764
00:59:36.281 --> 00:59:38.324
I told him I had a crush.

1765
00:59:38.366 --> 00:59:39.200
Ugh.

1766
00:59:39.242 --> 00:59:40.242
You have a crush?

1767
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:43.305
I told him I was having intense
sexual fantasies about you

1768
00:59:43.329 --> 00:59:46.124
when we were in an
ecstasy fueled meltdown

1769
00:59:46.165 --> 00:59:49.168
teeming with paranoia
and anxiety.

1770
00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.128
[Emma sighs]

1771
00:59:50.169 --> 00:59:52.964
I was just a horrible person,

1772
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:54.465
a stupid person.

1773
00:59:54.507 --> 00:59:56.718
Well, he's not exactly
being a saint, you know,

1774
00:59:56.759 --> 00:59:58.344
trying to make you jealous

1775
00:59:58.386 --> 01:00:01.806
with that phone call tonight
with that girl from work.

1776
01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.601
- Wait. Wait.
- Now, when you say fantasies-

1777
01:00:04.642 --> 01:00:07.770
Wait, you think he was trying
to make me jealous, like,

1778
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:08.813
on purpose?

1779
01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:10.273
Yeah.

1780
01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.750
It seemed pretty obvious
from what you were saying.

1781
01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:14.319
But when you say sexual,

1782
01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:16.613
- what exactly are we doing?
- Oh my God.

1783
01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.239
That is so unlike him.

1784
01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.492
That's...

1785
01:00:21.534 --> 01:00:24.162
I can't believe he
would do that.

1786
01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:28.958
I mean, that's something
I did in eighth grade

1787
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.793
when I was an idiot.

1788
01:00:30.835 --> 01:00:32.795
It's so mean.

1789
01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:35.590
Oh my God. [groans]

1790
01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:38.843
Oh my God, am I...

1791
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.304
Is he an idiot?

1792
01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:43.056
Am I married to an idiot?

1793
01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:44.867
Have I been married to
an idiot for like 10 years

1794
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.017
and didn't know it?

1795
01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.519
I mean, all's fair
and love and war,

1796
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.354
or so they say.

1797
01:00:49.395 --> 01:00:50.355
I mean, I,

1798
01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:53.816
I personally don't
advocate for, um,

1799
01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:54.692
-idiocy in-
-How could-

1800
01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:56.653
In love or, or, or-

1801
01:00:56.694 --> 01:00:58.071
I mean, I don't know

1802
01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.406
how I could have not
seen that, though.

1803
01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.785
You could fight fire with
fire, you know,

1804
01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:06.454
make him jealous too.

1805
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:08.580
Oh my...

1806
01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:11.917
I'll be, I'll be back.

1807
01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.130
Hey, was I wearing anything
specific in the, in the..

1808
01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.049
[door slams]

1809
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.884
It's a blessing and a cruse.

1810
01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.570
But, you know, I'm
just so good at it.

1811
01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:23.012
I look so cute doing it.

1812
01:01:23.054 --> 01:01:24.305
- [Josh] Yeah.
- Oh shit.

1813
01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.139
She looks pissed.

1814
01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.181
[door slams]

1815
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.850
Okay. Well, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna hang back.

1816
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:30.561
Honey, look, I know that-

1817
01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:31.562
[strike thuds]

1818
01:01:31.604 --> 01:01:32.814
Oh ow!

1819
01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.065
You just, you slapped me?

1820
01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.483
It was with a mitten.

1821
01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:37.026
What is wrong with you,

1822
01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:38.820
trying to make me jealous?

1823
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:39.696
[Josh sighs]

1824
01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:40.405
Is that...

1825
01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:41.447
That's what we are now?

1826
01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:42.889
-No, look, look-
-Like 12-year-olds?

1827
01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:44.867
I regressed, I did
something stupid,

1828
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:45.909
I know that.

1829
01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:47.537
But it's 'cause I'm out
of my mind and I,

1830
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:48.121
I didn't know what to do.

1831
01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:49.122
But don't you see?

1832
01:01:49.163 --> 01:01:50.623
You saw through that bullshit.

1833
01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:51.934
You're, you know me
better than anybody.

1834
01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:52.750
You saw right through it.

1835
01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:53.710
- You still came.
- No.

1836
01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.961
I, I didn't.

1837
01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:57.422
I never would've known
if Marlon didn't say

1838
01:01:57.463 --> 01:01:59.799
that you were doing
this stupid thing.

1839
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:00.883
Marlon?

1840
01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:02.760
So what, you...

1841
01:02:02.802 --> 01:02:04.804
So you were just
with Marlon now?

1842
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.265
I was at the gallery
setting up for the show.

1843
01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:08.266
You know, don't turn this into-

1844
01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.392
Hold on. I'm just trying...

1845
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.661
I'm just trying, I'm
trying to understand

1846
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.365
how that conversation
must have played out.

1847
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.956
So you would've had to have
like told him about our issues,

1848
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.315
about our private,
personal sexual issues.

1849
01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:19.193
We were having dinner.

1850
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:20.278
I was upset.

1851
01:02:20.319 --> 01:02:21.863
I had to talk to somebody.

1852
01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.406
I see. [chuckles]

1853
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:24.866
I get, I get what this is.

1854
01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:25.907
You, uh,

1855
01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.870
you...

1856
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.246
I made you jealous

1857
01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.390
and so now you're
making me jealous.

1858
01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.414
Oh my God.

1859
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:34.916
Seriously?

1860
01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.086
This is crazy.

1861
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.963
That was Marlon's suggestion.

1862
01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.090
Why does every man
suddenly think-

1863
01:02:41.132 --> 01:02:43.801
-Oh Marlon, Ma, Ma, Ma-
-That that's a good idea.

1864
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:46.471
Marlon suggested that you
should make me jealous, right?

1865
01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:47.552
That's what you're saying?

1866
01:02:48.347 --> 01:02:49.140
He suggested that you
make me jealous?

1867
01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.850
Can we have a conversation,

1868
01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.977
like a normal human
conversation?

1869
01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:54.812
- Ah.
- When did we transform

1870
01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:56.981
- into crazy people?
- Oh.

1871
01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:58.608
And by we, I mean you.

1872
01:02:58.649 --> 01:02:59.525
What is-

1873
01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:01.819
Can I just ask you something?

1874
01:03:01.861 --> 01:03:02.861
Tell me the truth.

1875
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:04.947
Did Marlon come over to the
house after I left last night?

1876
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:05.989
Oh my God.

1877
01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.535
[Josh] Did he, like, did
he kiss you? Did he...

1878
01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:10.577
What was it?

1879
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:12.931
Did he lift you up on the
desk and pull off your panties

1880
01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.499
-and penet-
-Yes. Yes, he did.

1881
01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.252
Yes. We had angry, angry
sex on our marital bed.

1882
01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:21.339
- And he, he drilled me so hard.
- Ah, ah, you think, you think

1883
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.816
- this is really funny?
- And I, I got hungry.

1884
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.800
-No, no! -Huh?

1885
01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:24.860
[Emma] Then I ordered pizza.

1886
01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.676
Yeah, yeah, this is-

1887
01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:27.512
I banged the pizza guy too.

1888
01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:29.931
And then there was
also a plumber,

1889
01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:32.350
and the plumber did that thing,

1890
01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:33.851
that [blows raspberry]

1891
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.604
thing that they do in the
pornos where all the j,

1892
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.147
the jizz all over my...

1893
01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.941
I couldn't even see.

1894
01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:44.028
And it was like all the
things in all the pornos.

1895
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:44.862
[Josh] Wow.

1896
01:03:44.904 --> 01:03:45.988
Are you se...

1897
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.698
Of, of course I
didn't do anything.

1898
01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.200
I don't know.

1899
01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:50.284
I don't know.

1900
01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:53.412
I don't know what to
think. [scoffs]

1901
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:55.122
You're walking away?

1902
01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.543
You're getting in your car?

1903
01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:00.044
[engine sputters and revs]

1904
01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.004
You're starting your car?

1905
01:04:03.256 --> 01:04:04.423
[car engine revving]

1906
01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:07.093
And you're driving away.

1907
01:04:07.134 --> 01:04:09.595
[pensive music]

1908
01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.158
Jesus. Fuck!

1909
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:32.928
What are you doing
here on a Saturday?

1910
01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:33.952
Mm-hmm.

1911
01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.666
Wait, don't you have
your wife's gallery,

1912
01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.084
showy thing tonight?

1913
01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:40.751
You're going to that, right?

1914
01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.086
No.

1915
01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:44.422
Tell me you're going to that.

1916
01:04:44.463 --> 01:04:45.463
Okay.

1917
01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.718
So if you're not gonna
go see your wife tonight,

1918
01:04:48.759 --> 01:04:50.428
what are you gonna do?

1919
01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:52.555
Oh, I'm thinking I'd
order Indian food,

1920
01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:56.142
watch some TV,
possibly kill myself.

1921
01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.935
All right.

1922
01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:58.686
You're coming to
a party with me.

1923
01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.770
Come on.

1924
01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:00.812
[scoffs] That is...

1925
01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:02.607
There's no way that
that is happening.

1926
01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.609
Yeah, you need the distraction.

1927
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:05.985
Yeah. You know what?

1928
01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:07.337
I'm just gonna stick
with the suicide plan.

1929
01:05:07.361 --> 01:05:09.530
Thanks, though, for offering.

1930
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.364
[pills rattling]

1931
01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:11.324
It's gonna be fun.

1932
01:05:11.365 --> 01:05:12.365
[Josh] Yeah,

1933
01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:14.327
a bunch of millennials
posting photos of themselves?

1934
01:05:14.368 --> 01:05:15.786
No, thank you.

1935
01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.122
No, it's actually gonna
be a bunch of hipsters

1936
01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:20.082
drinking craft beer
outta Mason jars.

1937
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.460
Oh my God, that's so much worse.

1938
01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.797
You got your car with you?

1939
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.841
Yeah. Why?

1940
01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:29.967
Great.

1941
01:05:30.009 --> 01:05:32.136
You're gonna take
me to the party.

1942
01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.298
-Uh... Come on.

1943
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.991
You're not gonna get these
back until you come with me.

1944
01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.058
[Josh] Ugh.

1945
01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:39.602
See where it's going?

1946
01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:40.787
- Let's go.
- [Josh] Oh my God.

1947
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:42.480
-Ugh. -Ooh.

1948
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:44.607
That's really gross.

1949
01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:46.001
You, you can, you can
just keep all that stuff.

1950
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:46.984
I don't need those things.

1951
01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.903
[Kelly] Let's go, Josh.

1952
01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:53.240
Do I have, do I have to?

1953
01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:55.159
[pensive music]

1954
01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:58.788
[recorded voice
speaking faintly]

1955
01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.289
Josh, where the hell are you?

1956
01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:02.625
You're not at the motel,
you're not at, at home.

1957
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.001
Your car's not in the driveway.

1958
01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:06.837
I, I, I need to get back
to the gallery, just,

1959
01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.048
can you please call me back?

1960
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:09.882
[gnome clinks]

1961
01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:10.924
Shit.

1962
01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:14.387
[gnome clinking]

1963
01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.806
[dog barking]

1964
01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:19.809
[mellow jazz music]

1965
01:06:19.850 --> 01:06:22.812
[indistinct chatter]

1966
01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.856
Uh, okay, you're her husband.

1967
01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:27.233
Congratulations.

1968
01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:28.275
Another new husband.

1969
01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:30.087
Do you want some
art to celebrate?

1970
01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.530
I always, always appreciate
it when you buy something

1971
01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:35.366
with each 'cause I think we
still got a couple paintings.

1972

2152
01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:47.588
Um,

2153
01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:51.844
and I'm in love with you.

2154
01:13:58.809 --> 01:13:59.809
Oh.

2155
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:05.607
Hey, Kelly, I'm...

2156
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:09.796
I, I don't know what to say.

2157
01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:11.196
I ha, I had no idea.

2158
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.366
Well, things between
you and Emma

2159
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:15.784
look like they're falling apart,

2160
01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:19.955
so I just wanted you
to know I'm here.

2161
01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.334
I mean, we have fun
together, we get along.

2162
01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:26.837
I'm super fun.

2163
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.134
I think you could
do a lot worse.

2164
01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.677
Oh God. No.

2165
01:14:33.927 --> 01:14:35.512
I mean, of course...

2166
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:36.472
Worse?

2167
01:14:36.513 --> 01:14:38.599
Look, you're, you're amazing.

2168
01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
I know.

2169
01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:41.809
So?

2170
01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.650
I'm, I'm in love with Emma.

2171
01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:50.777
She's the love of my life.

2172
01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.779
I'm sorry. What was that?

2173
01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:55.532
She, she's the one.

2174
01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.367
She's always been
the one for me.

2175
01:14:57.409 --> 01:15:00.871
I'm, I wanna be
with her forever.

2176
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.624
-I mean, no matter
what... Come again.

2177
01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.836
[suspenseful music]

2178
01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:08.837
Oh my God.

2179
01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:11.798
You, you fucking with me again!

2180
01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.300
- Whoa!
- Well, it worked.

2181
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.469
You know what?

2182
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.387
You, you know, you
have a problem.

2183
01:15:17.429 --> 01:15:18.263
You have a series of problems.

2184
01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.806
You're disturbed.

2185
01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:21.141
Um, I just saved your marriage,

2186
01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.392
so you're welcome.

2187
01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.186
Please. You don't even
believe in marriage.

2188
01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:26.355
No, just because I
think monogamy

2189
01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:29.024
is a fundamentally flawed
and antiquated construct

2190
01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.734
doesn't mean it's
bullshit for everyone.

2191
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.363
And you have to go pick
up your offspring.

2192
01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:37.241
Hey, is this room on
your credit card?

2193
01:15:37.282 --> 01:15:38.575
Yeah. Why?

2194
01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:42.162
Great. I'm gonna
order room service.

2195
01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:43.372
Oh, hey.

2196
01:15:43.413 --> 01:15:44.164
Hey. Psst.

2197
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.374
Yeah.

2198
01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:46.833
Happy anniversary.

2199
01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.546
Oh shit.

2200
01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:51.588
[Kelly laughs]

2201
01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:52.506
Right.

2202
01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:55.634
[door clicks and slams]

2203
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.224

[heels clicking]

2207
01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:29.500
Josh?

2208
01:16:32.170 --> 01:16:34.631
[door creaks]

2209
01:16:36.883 --> 01:16:39.970
[Emma gasps]

2210
01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.054
Em, we gotta go!

2211
01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.514
We're gonna be late!

2212
01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:45.976
Em?

2213
01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:48.729
[suspenseful music]

2214
01:16:56.486 --> 01:16:59.406
[message typing]

2215
01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:07.497
Wendy, what the fuck?

2216
01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:08.539
What?

2217
01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:10.876
Where's Josh?

2218
01:17:10.917 --> 01:17:12.919
I'm sorry, I, I, I just...

2219
01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.041
I didn't mean to trick you.

2220
01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:15.714
I just didn't know how
else to get you alone.

2221
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:16.715
I needed to talk to you.

2222
01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:17.883
Now?

2223
01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:19.343
In a motel?

2224
01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:20.719
Well, you said you'd
never had sex

2225
01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:23.263
on a swing before, right?

2226
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.473
There's a swing.

2227
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:27.809
Oh my God. Jesus.

2228
01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:28.602
That...

2229
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:29.978
I...

2230
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.814
Wendy, I was just,
like, spitballing.

2231
01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:35.817
You, you'd said you
wanted to try a swing

2232
01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:38.904
and Josh never
done that for you.

2233
01:17:38.945 --> 01:17:42.699
And I think, I think things
between you are broken.

2234
01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.285
Actually, my
relationship with Josh

2235
01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:48.163
is the only thing
that isn't broken.

2236
01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:52.376
Wendy, I'm so sorry for fucking
everything up between us,

2237
01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:53.502
okay?

2238
01:17:53.543 --> 01:17:54.503
I'm really sorry.

2239
01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:55.837
I came alive that night,

2240
01:17:55.879 --> 01:17:57.047
and you woke me up.

2241
01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.965
And I know you felt
something too.

2242
01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:01.635
Just give me one more chance.

2243
01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:03.679
I didn't, I was faking.

2244
01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.554
I'm sorry.

2245
01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:05.639
I didn't.

2246
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:06.681
I...

2247
01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:08.475
And we already tried that,
and look where it got us.

2248
01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:09.226
Look at this.

2249
01:18:09.267 --> 01:18:10.267
This is weird.

2250
01:18:11.728 --> 01:18:13.855
Okay, so fine.

2251
01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:15.375
So you just wanna
make out a little or, or-

2252
01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.191
No!

2253
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:17.234
No!

2254
01:18:17.275 --> 01:18:19.903
Well, wh, what about
the sex swing?

2255
01:18:21.196 --> 01:18:22.465
You have no idea how
hard it was for me

2256
01:18:22.489 --> 01:18:24.491
to put up that thing.

2257
01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.118
I don't, I don't wanna make out.

2258
01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:28.286
I don't wanna have sex
on the sex swing. Ugh.

2259
01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:29.788
I just want,

2260
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:34.084
I just wanna erase everything
and have my friend back,

2261
01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.919
okay?

2262
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:38.046
Can I please have
my friend back, like,

2263
01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.258
without the sex stuff, please?

2264
01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:44.553
Yes.

2265
01:18:44.594 --> 01:18:46.930
You can have your friend back.

2266
01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:52.686
You know, maybe once
in a while down the road,

2267
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:56.022
if we're really drunk some
time and the vibe is right-

2268
01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.190
-No. -No?

2269
01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.275
Not gonna happen.

2270
01:18:58.316 --> 01:19:00.193
Not gonna happen.

[whimsical music]

2272
01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:03.905
If I go to leave,

2273
01:19:03.947 --> 01:19:07.117
you promise you're not gonna
punch me in the throat?

2274
01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.120
I promise I will not
punch you in the throat.

2275
01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:14.124
You have to really push.

2276
01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:15.751
Tricky one.

[door creaks]

2280
01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.513
Dawn?

2281
01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:29.555
Gracie?

2282
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.019
[All] Surprise!

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.356
[Dawn] Daddy!

2284
01:19:38.398 --> 01:19:39.566
Hey. Oh.

2285
01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.610
- Happy Anniversary.
- Oh, were you surprised?

2286
01:19:41.651 --> 01:19:43.111
Yes, I was surprised.

2287
01:19:43.153 --> 01:19:45.363
[Dawn] Where's Mommy?

2288
01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:46.281
That's...

2289
01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:48.784
I'm gonna tell you in one sec,

2290
01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:51.119
so just hold, hold on.

2291
01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:52.078
Wow.

2292
01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.790
Arthur, worth the surprise.

2293
01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:57.334
Well, I thought it'd be good
for you guys to come back here.

2294
01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.376
Old memories.

[indistinct chatter]

2296
01:20:01.004 --> 01:20:03.673
- [Josh] Yeah.
- So where's my Emma?

2297
01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:04.841
Ha!

2298
01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:06.092
Right. One...

2299
01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.135
I will get to that.

2300
01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:08.011
Hi, everybody.

2301
01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:08.929
[Crowd] Hi.

2302
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.514
Thank you for being here.

2303
01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:11.973
Oh, hello?

2304
01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:12.974
That's, uh...

2305
01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:15.519
Oh, that seems unnecessary.

2306
01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560
Thank you.

2307
01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:21.149
Um, so it's really, uh, it's
unexpected to see you all here.

2308
01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:22.609
This is, uh...

2309
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.295
It's been a long time since
I've been in this room.

2310
01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:27.531
And, um, you know, seeing
all your familiar faces here,

2311
01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:28.572
it's weird.

2312
01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:30.200
It's like, 'cause it's
out of context.

2313
01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:31.701
- [Grace] Dad?
- Yeah.

2314
01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:33.203
You're being super awkward.

2315
01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:35.205
[group laughing]

2316
01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:35.997
- [woman] Yep.
- [man] Yeah.

2317
01:20:36.039 --> 01:20:37.958
Seriously, where's Mom?

2318
01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:40.627
Mom? Where's Mom?

2319
01:20:42.128 --> 01:20:45.382
So I bet you're all
wondering where Emma is.

2320
01:20:45.423 --> 01:20:48.552
Funny story. [chuckles]

2321
01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:54.933
You know how sometimes
you, when you wake up, right?

2322
01:20:54.975 --> 01:20:55.892
So Emma...

2323
01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.603
So this is, this is a good one.

2324
01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.564
So your mom, when your
mom, when Emma woke...

2325
01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:03.733
She wakes up and... [laughs]

2326
01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:04.776
I...

2327
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.945
Look... [sighs]

2328
01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:07.863
She's here.

2329
01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:08.738
She just pulled up.

2330
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.656
I'll be right back.

2331
01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.574
Everybody wait here.

2332
01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:11.741
Oh, it's fine.

2333
01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:14.411
Mom's here.

2334
01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:15.245
Party begins.

2335
01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:16.287
Yeah.

2336
01:21:21.793 --> 01:21:23.420
-Hi. -[Emma] Hey.

2337
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.088
I went by the house
to pick you up.

2338
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.173
I know. It's a long story.

2339
01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.258
I'll tell you later.

2340
01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.300
Okay.

2341
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.346
Wendy told me that all
our friends and family

2342
01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.848
are in there.

2343
01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.099
[Emma sighs]

2344
01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:39.144
I guess you were right
about my dad's big plan.

2345
01:21:40.645 --> 01:21:42.898
I, I, I have to tell
you something.

2346
01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:47.736
Um, I, um, I made out
with Kelly last night.

2347
01:21:48.778 --> 01:21:51.865
I might have touched
her boobs a little.

2348
01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.243
- Different Kelly.
- Oh.

2349
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:56.953
But I only did it because
I thought that,

2350
01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.788
that you slept with Marlon.

2351
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.081
I didn't sleep with Marlon.

2352
01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:01.791
I, I know.

2353
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.752
I, I, I, I know that now.

2354
01:22:03.793 --> 01:22:06.504
Of course you, of course
you didn't sleep with Marlon.

2355
01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:07.546
Idiot.

2356
01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.345
I'm so sorry.

2357
01:22:13.386 --> 01:22:14.179
Just shut up.

2358
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:15.220
I love you.

2359
01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:20.894
[Emma whimpering]

2360
01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.605
We really messed things
up there, didn't we?

2361
01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:24.981
That was, that was all crazy.

2362
01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:27.275
We saw my parents
having group sex.

2363
01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.944
[Arthur laughs]

2364
01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:29.985
It's a metaphor.

2365
01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.281
[Josh] Yeah, at the sex
club that we went to.

2366
01:22:33.323 --> 01:22:34.824
That weird room.

2367
01:22:34.866 --> 01:22:36.159
Oh my God, that was so weird.

2368
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.244
- The bunny lady.
- [Josh] Yes.

2369
01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:39.329
Those horse guys.

2370
01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.455
Oh yeah.

2371
01:22:40.497 --> 01:22:42.582
Oh, by the way,
they're, they're here.

2372
01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.501
Uh, your dad must have-

2373
01:22:44.542 --> 01:22:45.460
[Arthur] For the love of God.

2374
01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:48.171
Why is no one turning this off?

2375
01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.382
Do you know where we are?

2376
01:22:50.423 --> 01:22:51.508
Yeah.

2377
01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:52.676
This is the,

2378
01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:54.070
- this is the exact spot.
- This is the spot.

2379
01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.553
Oh my God. Yeah.

2380
01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:57.639
It was, uh, it was Disco Night.

2381
01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:58.556
Mm-hmm.

2382
01:22:58.598 --> 01:22:59.700
- I was so excited.
- You were,

2383
01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:00.868
you were headed
back to your cabin,

2384
01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:02.244
- you were walking back.
- And then

2385
01:23:02.268 --> 01:23:05.647
you tapped me on the
shoulder and I turned around,

2386
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:08.233
and you leaned in with
this confidence that-

2387
01:23:08.274 --> 01:23:10.694
[gentle music]

2388
01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:21.454
Our teens, 20s-

2389
01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:22.496
God.

2390
01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:25.792
We're not those people anymore.

2391
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.753
No, we're not.

2392
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:33.133
- [Grace] Mommy!
- [Dawn] Mommy!

2393
01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.051
Hey, you guys.

2394
01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.803
Oh.

2395
01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.305
[pensive music]

2396
01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:42.433
Hey.

2397
01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.645
[Emma groans]

2398
01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:46.646
[Josh] All right.

2399
01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:47.480
Let's go, let's go.

2400
01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.314
Everyone's waiting.

2401
01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.899
Come on, you guys.

2402
01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.569
[Grace] Daddy, you should
stop saying bad words,

2403
01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.988
'cause we could hear
everything you say.

2404
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.114
[Josh] Oh dear, that...

2405
01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:56.948
No, that's not...

2406
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.158
That's not good.

2407
01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.910
[Dawn] What's a sex club?

2408
01:24:00.952 --> 01:24:02.537
[funky music]

2409
01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:14.174
I've got you down to a science

2410
01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:18.386
But you don't stand a chance

2411
01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.346
You play your tricks, girl

2412
01:24:20.388 --> 01:24:22.390
You can't deny it

2413
01:24:22.432 --> 01:24:26.269
But you don't stand a chance

2414
01:24:29.814 --> 01:24:33.318
You've got to butter me up

2415
01:24:37.655 --> 01:24:41.910
Don't you hurt my precious ego

2416
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:46.122
You know what to do

2417
01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:49.626
Don't go saying
things to be nasty

2418
01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.711
Unless you follow through

2419
01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.678
You've got to butter me up

2420
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:07.185
You've got to butter me up

2421
01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:11.856
You've got to butter me up

2422
01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:15.652
Butter me up

2423
01:25:15.693 --> 01:25:18.530
You've got to butter me up

2424
01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:22.659
[funky music continues]

2425
01:26:01.322 --> 01:26:02.991
Two, three

2426
01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:06.202
[funky music continues]

2427
01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:15.753
Butter me up

01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:20.508
You've got to butter me up

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:24.220
Butter me up

01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:32.604
Butter me up

2432
01:26:32.645 --> 01:26:36.733
You've got to butter me up

2433
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.987
Butter me up

2434
01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:45.533
You got to butter me up

2435
01:26:45.575 --> 01:26:49.537
You got to butter me up

2436
01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:50.830
Shake it, baby girl

2437
01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:53.958
Butter me up

2438
01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.879

Butter me up
