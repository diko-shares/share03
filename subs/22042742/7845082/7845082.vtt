172
00:07:05.805 --> 00:07:07.460
Or, I'm just throwing
this out there,

173
00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:12.184
you can have two hours of
amazing, vivacious,

174
00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:16.115
sort of hauntingly
erotic conversation.

175
00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.977
- Hauntingly erotic?
- Hauntingly erotic?

176
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:19.701
And you can go home anyway.

177
00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:22.494
You know, get yourself off,
like, flick your little bean.

178
00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.323
- Oh?
- Yeah.

179
00:07:24.357 --> 00:07:26.471
And you don't have to wake up
next to 30 seconds to Mars.

180
00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:28.702
All right, well, I've got
a proposition for you.

181
00:07:28.737 --> 00:07:30.564
How about you give me back
my fucking whiskey

182
00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.288
and stop talking about me
flicking at my fucking bean?

183
00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:35.426
- Okay.
- How about that?

184
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:37.150
Have you confirmed with him?

185
00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:39.978
No, I have not given him a time.

186
00:07:40.012 --> 00:07:41.575
Poor guy. It's kind of sad.
He's probably at home

187
00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:44.565
scrolling through your
social media, fingers sweaty,

188
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.600
hand firmly on cock, just...

189
00:07:47.634 --> 00:07:49.358
Beating that meat,
waiting for your text

190
00:07:49.393 --> 00:07:51.669
to pop up at the top.

191
00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:53.427
Mm. I've blown off
twice already, so.

192
00:07:53.462 --> 00:07:54.979
- Third time's a charm.
- Yeah.

193
00:07:55.013 --> 00:07:57.600
Come on, get a drink
with your old pal Robbie.

194
00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:00.772
It's my long time
employee Robbie.

195
00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:03.187
- That's a little bit harsh.
- It's true. I own you.

196
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:04.646
- You own me?
- You're on my payroll. Yeah.

197
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.635
Mama. Okay. Okay. Okay.

198
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.773
I'm going to change your mind.
Have you heard his music?

199
00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:12.704
- I have not bothered, no.
- Oh, that answers a lot.

200
00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:14.325
Why? What you got?

201
00:08:14.359 --> 00:08:15.680
Robbie: I'll show you something
something fun.

202
00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:17.118
Tori: Hmm.

203
00:08:17.152 --> 00:08:19.083
All right. Ready?

204
00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:21.153
I'm losing interest already.
Come on.

205
00:08:21.188 --> 00:08:22.498
Alright, you'll see.

206
00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:23.991
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

207
00:08:24.015 --> 00:08:26.567
What?

208
00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:29.567
- Oh, my god.
- Soothing.

209
00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.302
Tori: Shut the fuck up.
Why is he whisper singing?

210
00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:32.750
Robbie: Doesn't want to
wake his parents, probably.

211
00:08:32.774 --> 00:08:34.153
What the fuck?
Turn that off.

212
00:08:34.188 --> 00:08:35.705
Why are you showing
that to me? Stop.

213
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.371
Well, you know, it's not like
you're going to saddle up

214
00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.233
with the son of a bitch.
I mean, you should probably

215
00:08:39.257 --> 00:08:42.292
let the guy go back
to his family and his kids.

216
00:08:42.327 --> 00:08:43.706
He's a daddy, after all.

217
00:08:43.741 --> 00:08:45.189
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

218
00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:48.361
Little Tommy tinder.

219
00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:50.154
Well...

220
00:08:52.327 --> 00:08:53.613
All right.
Let's go get shit faced.

221
00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.361
But you're not getting
anything either.

222
00:08:55.396 --> 00:08:57.027
So if you want to go flick
your fucking bean,

223
00:08:57.051 --> 00:08:58.223
do what you need to do.

224
00:08:58.258 --> 00:08:59.776
- Come on.
- All right.

225
00:08:59.811 --> 00:09:01.407
- Turn off the music.
- Well, considering you were

226
00:09:01.431 --> 00:09:02.787
gonna saddle up
with old Emmett eyeliner,

227
00:09:02.811 --> 00:09:04.535
I'm not sure
how I should feel about that.

228
00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:06.407
Well, I don't work with them
Emmett eyeliner, do I?

229
00:09:06.431 --> 00:09:08.062
Well, I am better looking in
that douche, though, right?

230
00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:09.431
Do you want to fucking die?

231
00:09:09.466 --> 00:09:11.166
Get your fucking grubby shoes
off the counter.

232
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.466
Kill the music
before I change my mind.

233
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.683
- Should I meet you there or?
- No, we're going to walk.

234
00:09:16.707 --> 00:09:21.225
- Well, it's fucking snowing out.
- Oh, my god. That's so scary!

235
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.191
Come on.
Get those chicken legs out.

236
00:09:23.225 --> 00:09:25.294
Let's go for a walk.
I got to bring this to lahna.

237
00:09:25.329 --> 00:09:27.270
Robbie: Why? They close at 6:00.
They're not going to be open.

238
00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:28.743
No, they'll still be there.

239
00:09:28.777 --> 00:09:30.777
They're having a little
Christmas Eve fuckfest.

240
00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:32.363
What the hell, why?

241
00:09:32.398 --> 00:09:34.098
Tori: You don't want to fuck
in a toy store?

242
00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:36.260
No. Well, mm, maybe. I mean...

243
00:09:36.294 --> 00:09:37.789
Sounds like you don't want
to fuck in a toy store.

244
00:09:37.813 --> 00:09:40.123
It's just kind of weird.
Like, I feel sorry for the kid

245
00:09:40.157 --> 00:09:42.099
that's going to go in tomorrow,
buy a Teddy bear covered

246
00:09:42.123 --> 00:09:43.537
- in fucking cum.
- Oh, my god.

247
00:09:43.571 --> 00:09:45.295
We're going to scar him.
That poor child.

248
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.675
Come on. Lock up behind you.

249
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:56.020
Robbie:
We could have taken my car.

250
00:09:56.055 --> 00:09:57.365
Would have been a smart option.

251
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.365
Do you want to keep
keep complaining?

252
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.055
Or do you want to just walk
in silence?

253
00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:02.514
- What do you want to do?
- You're the one who was

254
00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:04.538
complaining all day about
fucking Christmas this,

255
00:10:04.572 --> 00:10:05.996
Christmas that, oh, I fucking
hate Christmas.

256
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.641
Well, Christmas fucking sucks.

257
00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:10.193
Do you not agree that there's
no good fucking Christmas music,

258
00:10:10.227 --> 00:10:12.469
- no good Christmas movies.
- Bad religion had

259
00:10:12.503 --> 00:10:14.617
- a great Christmas album.
- Just fucking get it over with.

260
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:16.539
- Eh.
- It was good.

261
00:10:16.573 --> 00:10:19.435
There aren't many albums
that give me that spirit

262
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.780
of fucking Christmas.

263
00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:22.608
Well, bad fuckin' religion,
ain't it, buddy.

264
00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:24.263
Give me that.

265
00:10:24.297 --> 00:10:30.090
I would go as far to say
there's like fucking two...

266
00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:31.987
Two Christmas songs
that are good,

267
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:35.471
and that's if you don't count,
if and only if, you don't count

268
00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:37.505
fucking crypt keeper
"Christmas rap."

269
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.057
Okay, love
"tales from the crypt."

270
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:41.057
That song sucks the fucking shit
out of my ass.

271
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:44.643
This is coming from a guy
who jizzes his fucking pants

272
00:10:44.678 --> 00:10:48.781
every single time he hears
buster Poindexter's cover of

273
00:10:48.816 --> 00:10:50.747
"zat you, Santa claus?"

274
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:52.654
Robbie: No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't like that cover.

275
00:10:52.678 --> 00:10:54.265
I like the version
with the commentary

276
00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:56.127
from beavis and butthead.

277
00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:58.299
- Okay.
- Okay.

278
00:10:58.334 --> 00:11:00.023
"Merry Christmas", ramones,
then.

279
00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.299
That's mine. What's your big
fucking runner up?

280
00:11:02.334 --> 00:11:07.334
Uh, sorry to say,
but "merry Christmas", ramones,

281
00:11:07.368 --> 00:11:09.127
that's a fucking runner up.

282
00:11:09.161 --> 00:11:10.299
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

283
00:11:10.334 --> 00:11:11.575
- First place...
- Fuck you.

284
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.231
First place is our lord
and savior lemmy

285
00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:15.473
with "run Rudolph run."
Oh, it's magic!

286
00:11:15.507 --> 00:11:17.173
Robbie: Okay.
It's not like it's motorhead.

287
00:11:17.197 --> 00:11:18.621
It's lemmy with
the fucking Foo Fighters.

288
00:11:18.645 --> 00:11:20.783
- Oh, r.I.P.
- Oh, r.I.P.

289
00:11:20.818 --> 00:11:23.162
Also lemmy is fucking motorhead,
you idiot.

290
00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:24.231
Yeah.

291
00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:25.473
Hey!

292
00:11:25.507 --> 00:11:28.197
Lahna! [ Laughs ]

293

She knows you're coming, right?

294
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.577
Yeah, of course
she knows I'm fucking coming.

295
00:11:31.612 --> 00:11:33.129
Oh.

296
00:11:33.163 --> 00:11:35.025
- Hey, bitch.
- Hi!

297
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.474
Mwah! You look so good.

298
00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:37.519
- Thank you.
- Hey, gorgeous.

299
00:11:37.543 --> 00:11:39.232
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

300
00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:42.612
I brought you and Jay
a little something, something.

301
00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:44.232
Ooh, I got you this.

302
00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:45.484
Oh, my god. I love you so much.

303
00:11:45.508 --> 00:11:47.336
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

304
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.681
Tori: Where's Jay?

305
00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:50.716
He's in the back, freshening up.

306
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:53.475
You know, he just gets
a little musty.

307
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:55.544
He gets a little musty?

308
00:11:55.578 --> 00:11:57.140
- You got a lot going on.
- Musty she says.

309
00:11:57.164 --> 00:11:58.692
Lahna: Yeah, you know
all about that, right?

310
00:11:58.716 --> 00:11:59.761
- No, I do.
- You know all about that?

311
00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.371
- Baby.
- Yeah.

312
00:12:01.406 --> 00:12:02.589
You know all about
a little musty must?

313
00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:04.268
I got a stinky dick.

314
00:12:04.302 --> 00:12:06.509
- [ Laughs ] That's so fucked up.
- Cute, right?

315
00:12:06.544 --> 00:12:07.992
- Bitch.
- Yeah?

316
00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:09.613
You already cracked this open.

317
00:12:09.648 --> 00:12:12.338
We may have had, like,
like a couple of drinks.

318
00:12:12.372 --> 00:12:15.683
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

319
00:12:15.717 --> 00:12:17.993
I know. I know. It's very nice.
And listen.

320
00:12:18.027 --> 00:12:19.659
Because we love you.
We didn't buy it for you.

321
00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:21.786
We're giving it to you.

322
00:12:21.821 --> 00:12:24.372
- Well, merry fucking Christmas.
- Merry fucking Christmas.

- On it. Jesus Christ!

- Hey!
- This motherfucker.

325

I haven't seen you in so long.

326
00:12:29.753 --> 00:12:31.408
- How are you?
- Oh, yeah. Right?

327
00:12:31.442 --> 00:12:33.063
- How are you?
- Hey, bro.

- Hey, buddy. Merry Christmas.

- You look good.
- Thank you.

330

- Yeah, you do.
- I've been doing nothing but

331
00:12:37.615 --> 00:12:40.235
selling toys and fucking
living the clean life.

332
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.994
- Keep up.
- [ Sniffs ]

What's going on here?

- Uh, just grabbing a drink.
- Just grabbing a drink.

335
00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:48.592
I had to talk her out
of some tinder trash.

336
00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:50.064
You didn't talk me
out of anything.
