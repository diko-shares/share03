closing up out back.
You got it?

00:03:17.003 --> 00:03:18.658

- Hi.

59
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.082
It's about time you show
your fucking face around here.

60
00:03:23.106 --> 00:03:24.324
Yeah, I've been busy.
You guys are swamped.

61
00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:25.934
-I know, I know.

62
00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.496
I thought you and lahna
were closing tonight.

63
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.003
Yeah, no, I told her I had to
run home because I, um...

64
00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:31.279
Didn't get her gift.

65
00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:32.865
- I did get her a gift.
- Oh, did you?

66
00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.256
But I'm now second guessing it,
so now I'm going

67
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.670
- to get some records.
- Oh, yeah, you should be

68
00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:37.152
second guessing this.
She has both of these.

69
00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:38.625
- She does.
- She does. Yeah.

70
00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.383
Uh, follow me. Come on.

71
00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:42.349
You guys been together
for, what, like a year?

72
00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:44.038
How are you this fucking dumb?

73
00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.876
No, I'm not... it's...
I can't tell the difference

74
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.142
between all these bands that
the logos all look the same.

75
00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:49.911
- They all look the fucking same?
- They all look the same.

76
00:03:49.935 --> 00:03:51.876
- All scratchy and weird.
- Yeah, they kind of do.

77
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.488
Uh, all right, so what I'm going
to show you now... yes.

78
00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:57.867
We saw these guys open at
a festival this summer.

79
00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:01.350
She was fucking all over it.
They've got the psychedelic,

80
00:04:01.384 --> 00:04:02.970
cosmic riff.
She'll fucking love it.

81
00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:04.212
- Deathcrux?
- Yeah.

82
00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:05.626
Okay. And she does
not have this?

83
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.212
- She does not have this.
- Right on.

84
00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.567
- You're welcome.
- Yes. No, thank you, Tori.

85
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:10.453
Thank you.
You saved Christmas again.

86
00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:14.351
Tori: By the way, I will come
and say merry Christmas

87
00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.006
- to Lauren.
- Sounds good.

88
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.672
But just don't tell her
I showed up here, okay?

89
00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:19.568
- What are you talking about?
- Don't do the whole thing you do

90
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.120
- when you're like...
- "Oh, my god, it's so good

91
00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:23.075
- to see you.
- No, yeah, don't do that.

92
00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:24.213
- Okay, bye.
- Okay.

93
00:04:24.247 --> 00:04:25.558
- Robbie.
- Hey, bro.

94
00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:27.154

Almost 2 grand.

98
00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:41.214
- Yeah, that's a big day.
- Does that mean a big boy bonus?

99
00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.938
- Means a bonus, yeah.
- Fuck yeah, dawg!

100
00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:46.455
What are you going
to do with your big bonus?

101
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.938
You got any plans?

102
00:04:47.972 --> 00:04:49.190
Well, the talent show
is at 8:00 P.M.

103
00:04:49.214 --> 00:04:50.904
- So, no, not really.
- Yeah.

104
00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:52.605
What are you going to do this
fine Christmas Eve?

105
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.525
I was potentially going to go
meet up with a dude,

106
00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560
but I don't know.

107
00:04:59.594 --> 00:05:01.180
- A dude, a man.
- Yep.

108
00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:02.536
Okay, on Christmas Eve,
you're going to invite

109
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.284
a stranger to your house.

110
00:05:04.318 --> 00:05:05.536
Uh, a stranger to
Reggie's, yeah.

111
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.111
Okay, cool.
Fuck, they're still open.

112
00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:08.880
Did you meet him organically,

113
00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:10.399
or is this, like, a tinder
sort of scenario?

114
00:05:10.423 --> 00:05:13.319
- Tinder situation, yeah.
- Oh, tinder, okay.

115
00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:14.595
- Yeah.
- Can I see him?

116
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.354
- Eh.
- Eh. He must be a fucking stud.

117
00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:18.940
What the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

118
00:05:18.974 --> 00:05:21.388
You want me to go home,
drink some whiskey,

119
00:05:21.423 --> 00:05:24.319
sit by the fire by my lonesome,
watch "a Christmas story"

120
00:05:24.354 --> 00:05:27.250
like every other
fucking douchebag in america?

121
00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.044
Yeah. Sounds kind of nice.

122
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:32.044
Or you to go to
drink some whiskey with me.

123
00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.331
Uh, that lahna's Christmas gift.

124
00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:34.872
- Is it?
- So you can put a fuckin'...

125
00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:36.572
- No longer.
- What the fuck are you doing?

126
00:05:36.596 --> 00:05:38.182
So, fuck no.

127
00:05:38.217 --> 00:05:39.493
I wanted to do that, too.

128
00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:41.872
So hand me some cups,
and let's go.

129
00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:43.906
Are you gonna go see
your pops up north tomorrow?

130
00:05:43.941 --> 00:05:45.320
- Yeah.
- You should probably get

131
00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:46.986
- a head start late tonight.
- No. Fuck that.

132
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.321
One day, in and out, is my rule.

133
00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:49.907
I can't see anything
wrong in that.

134
00:05:49.942 --> 00:05:51.252
- Fair enough.
- Mazel tov.

135
00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:55.114
Robbie: Mazel tov.
Cheers, motherfucker.

136
00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:56.873
Only quit stalling.
Show me Tommy tinder.

137
00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:58.873
What the fuck is
your obsession with this?

138
00:05:58.907 --> 00:06:00.332
- I want to see him.
- I don't want to

139
00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:01.608
- show him to you.
- Is he big? Is he a big boy?

140
00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:03.080
- Oh.
- Bbw.

141
00:06:03.114 --> 00:06:04.470
- That what you want to know?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:04.494 --> 00:06:07.460
In that case,
I'll fuckin' show you. Here.

143
00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:11.357
What?

144
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.219
I didn't know you knew
Emmett eyeliner.

145
00:06:13.253 --> 00:06:15.288
Emmett eyeliner.
Why are you calling him that?

146
00:06:15.322 --> 00:06:16.678
- Do you know him?
- I know of him.

147
00:06:16.702 --> 00:06:18.322
Did he tell you he got,
like, three kids?

148
00:06:18.357 --> 00:06:20.046
Wait four.
Someone's pregnant now, I think.

149
00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:22.391
- Oh, fuck! He's got kids?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:24.081
I don't fucking care.

151
00:06:24.115 --> 00:06:26.461
I just want a little
Christmas Eve schlong.

152
00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:29.082
Well, dude's a genic jackhammer.

153
00:06:29.116 --> 00:06:31.254
- Oh, Jesus.
- Little, uh, sperm canon,

154
00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.047
all I'm saying.

155
00:06:33.082 --> 00:06:35.265
Okay, I'm happy you told me
that, so I'll wear my dental dam

156
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:37.392
and get fucking sauced
before he shows up.

157
00:06:37.427 --> 00:06:39.323
Thank you.
That's so sweet of you.

158
00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:40.368
Robbie: Well,
I'll tell you what.

159
00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:41.875
I can go to Reggie's with you

160
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.220
because, um, I don't really
have shit to do.

161
00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:46.462
Robbie, that's very,
very sweet of you,

162
00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:47.669
but I want to get laid.

163
00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:49.428
Not wax poetic
with the regulars.

164
00:06:49.462 --> 00:06:52.324
Well, seeing as you didn't
buy me a Christmas present

165
00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:54.186
this year, I'm going
to take this.

166
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:55.566
- Oh.
- Thank you.

167
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.393
And you can enjoy your,
what, two hours

168
00:06:57.428 --> 00:07:01.600
of unbearable conversation,
your 7 seconds of lame sex.

169
00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:05.670
You go home, probably, you know,
get yourself off anyway.

170
00:07:05.705 --> 00:07:07.360
Or, I'm just throwing
this out there,

171
00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:12.084
you can have two hours of
amazing, vivacious,

172
00:07:12.118 --> 00:07:16.015
sort of hauntingly
erotic conversation.

173
00:07:16.049 --> 00:07:17.877
- Hauntingly erotic?
- Hauntingly erotic?

174
00:07:17.911 --> 00:07:19.601
And you can go home anyway.

175
00:07:19.636 --> 00:07:22.394
You know, get yourself off,
like, flick your little bean.

176
00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:24.223
- Oh?
- Yeah.

177
00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:26.371
And you don't have to wake up
next to 30 seconds to Mars.

178
00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:28.602
All right, well, I've got
a proposition for you.

179
00:07:28.637 --> 00:07:30.464
How about you give me back
my fucking whiskey

180
00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:34.188
and stop talking about me
flicking at my fucking bean?

181
00:07:34.223 --> 00:07:35.326
- Okay.
- How about that?

182
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:37.050
Have you confirmed with him?

183
00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:39.878
No, I have not given him a time.

184
00:07:39.912 --> 00:07:41.475
Poor guy. It's kind of sad.
He's probably at home

185
00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:44.465
scrolling through your
social media, fingers sweaty,

186
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500
hand firmly on cock, just...

187
00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:49.258
Beating that meat,
waiting for your text

188
00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:51.569
to pop up at the top.

189
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:53.327
Mm. I've blown off
twice already, so.

190
00:07:53.362 --> 00:07:54.879
- Third time's a charm.
- Yeah.

191
00:07:54.913 --> 00:07:57.500
Come on, get a drink
with your old pal Robbie.

192
00:07:57.534 --> 00:08:00.672
It's my long time
employee Robbie.

193
00:08:00.707 --> 00:08:03.087
- That's a little bit harsh.
- It's true. I own you.

194
00:08:03.121 --> 00:08:04.546
- You own me?
- You're on my payroll. Yeah.

195
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.535
Mama. Okay. Okay. Okay.

196
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.673
I'm going to change your mind.
Have you heard his music?

197
00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:12.604
- I have not bothered, no.
- Oh, that answers a lot.

198
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.225
Why? What you got?

199
00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.580
Robbie: I'll show you something
something fun.

200
00:08:15.604 --> 00:08:17.018
Tori: Hmm.

201
00:08:17.052 --> 00:08:18.983
All right. Ready?

202
00:08:19.018 --> 00:08:21.053
I'm losing interest already.
Come on.

203
00:08:21.088 --> 00:08:22.398
Alright, you'll see.

204
00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:23.891
Hang on, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on.

205
00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:26.467
What?

206
00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:29.467
- Oh, my god.
- Soothing.

207
00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:31.202
Tori: Shut the fuck up.
Why is he whisper singing?

208
00:08:31.226 --> 00:08:32.650
Robbie: Doesn't want to
wake his parents, probably.

209
00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:34.053
What the fuck?
Turn that off.

210
00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:35.605
Why are you showing
that to me? Stop.

211
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.271
Well, you know, it's not like
you're going to saddle up

212
00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:39.133
with the son of a bitch.
I mean, you should probably

213
00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:42.192
let the guy go back
to his family and his kids.

214
00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:43.606
He's a daddy, after all.

215
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:45.089
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

216
00:08:45.123 --> 00:08:48.261
Little Tommy tinder.

217
00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:50.054
Well...

218
00:08:52.227 --> 00:08:53.513
All right.
Let's go get shit faced.

219
00:08:53.537 --> 00:08:55.261
But you're not getting
anything either.

220
00:08:55.296 --> 00:08:56.927
So if you want to go flick
your fucking bean,

221
00:08:56.951 --> 00:08:58.123
do what you need to do.

222
00:08:58.158 --> 00:08:59.676
- Come on.
- All right.

223
00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:01.307
- Turn off the music.
- Well, considering you were

224
00:09:01.331 --> 00:09:02.687
gonna saddle up
with old Emmett eyeliner,

225
00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:04.435
I'm not sure
how I should feel about that.

226
00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:06.307
Well, I don't work with them
Emmett eyeliner, do I?

227
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:07.962
Well, I am better looking in
that douche, though, right?

228
00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:09.331
Do you want to fucking die?

229
00:09:09.366 --> 00:09:11.066
Get your fucking grubby shoes
off the counter.

230
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.366
Kill the music
before I change my mind.

231
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.583
- Should I meet you there or?
- No, we're going to walk.

232
00:09:16.607 --> 00:09:21.125
- Well, it's fucking snowing out.
- Oh, my god. That's so scary!

233
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.091
Come on.
Get those chicken legs out.

234
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.194
Let's go for a walk.
I got to bring this to lahna.

235
00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:27.170
Robbie: Why? They close at 6:00.
They're not going to be open.

236
00:09:27.194 --> 00:09:28.643
No, they'll still be there.

237
00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:30.677
They're having a little
Christmas Eve fuckfest.

238
00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:32.263
What the hell, why?

239
00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:33.998
Tori: You don't want to fuck
in a toy store?

240
00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:36.160
No. Well, mm, maybe. I mean...

241
00:09:36.194 --> 00:09:37.689
Sounds like you don't want
to fuck in a toy store.

242
00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:40.023
It's just kind of weird.
Like, I feel sorry for the kid

243
00:09:40.057 --> 00:09:41.999
that's going to go in tomorrow,
buy a Teddy bear covered

244
00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:43.437
- in fucking cum.
- Oh, my god.

245
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:45.195
We're going to scar him.
That poor child.

246
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.575
Come on. Lock up behind you.

247
00:09:54.471 --> 00:09:55.920
Robbie:
We could have taken my car.

248
00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:57.265
Would have been a smart option.

249
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.265
Do you want to keep
keep complaining?

250
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.955
Or do you want to just walk
in silence?

251
00:10:00.989 --> 00:10:02.414
- What do you want to do?
- You're the one who was

252
00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:04.438
complaining all day about
fucking Christmas this,

253
00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:05.896
Christmas that, oh, I fucking
hate Christmas.

254
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.541
Well, Christmas fucking sucks.

255
00:10:07.576 --> 00:10:10.093
Do you not agree that there's
no good fucking Christmas music,

256
00:10:10.127 --> 00:10:12.369
- no good Christmas movies.
- Bad religion had

257
00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:14.517
- a great Christmas album.
- Just fucking get it over with.

258
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:16.439
- Eh.
- It was good.

259
00:10:16.473 --> 00:10:19.335
There aren't many albums
that give me that spirit

260
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.680
of fucking Christmas.

261
00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:22.508
Well, bad fuckin' religion,
ain't it, buddy.

262
00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:24.163
Give me that.

263
00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:29.990
I would go as far to say
there's like fucking two...

264
00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:31.887
Two Christmas songs
that are good,

265
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:35.371
and that's if you don't count,
if and only if, you don't count

266
00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:37.405
fucking crypt keeper
"Christmas rap."

267
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.957
Okay, love
"tales from the crypt."

268
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:40.957
That song sucks the fucking shit
out of my ass.

269
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:44.543
This is coming from a guy
who jizzes his fucking pants

270
00:10:44.578 --> 00:10:48.681
every single time he hears
buster Poindexter's cover of

271
00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:50.647
"zat you, Santa claus?"

272
00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:52.554
Robbie: No, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't like that cover.

273
00:10:52.578 --> 00:10:54.165
I like the version
with the commentary

274
00:10:54.199 --> 00:10:56.027
from beavis and butthead.

275
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:58.199
- Okay.
- Okay.

276
00:10:58.234 --> 00:10:59.923
"Merry Christmas", ramones,
then.

277
00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.199
That's mine. What's your big
fucking runner up?

278
00:11:02.234 --> 00:11:07.234
Uh, sorry to say,
but "merry Christmas", ramones,

279
00:11:07.268 --> 00:11:09.027
that's a fucking runner up.

280
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:10.199
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

281
00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:11.475
- First place...
- Fuck you.

282
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.131
First place is our lord
and savior lemmy

283
00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.373
with "run Rudolph run."
Oh, it's magic!

284
00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:17.073
Robbie: Okay.
It's not like it's motorhead.

285
00:11:17.097 --> 00:11:18.521
It's lemmy with
the fucking Foo Fighters.

286
00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.683
- Oh, r.I.P.
- Oh, r.I.P.

287
00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:23.062
Also lemmy is fucking motorhead,
you idiot.

288
00:11:23.097 --> 00:11:24.131
Yeah.

289
00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.373
Hey!

290
00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:28.097
Lahna!

291
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:29.545
She knows you're coming, right?

292
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.477
Yeah, of course
she knows I'm fucking coming.

293
00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:33.029
Oh.

294
00:11:33.063 --> 00:11:34.925
- Hey, bitch.
- Hi!

295
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.374
Mwah! You look so good.

296
00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:37.419
- Thank you.
- Hey, gorgeous.

297
00:11:37.443 --> 00:11:39.132
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

298
00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:42.512
I brought you and Jay
a little something, something.

299
00:11:42.546 --> 00:11:44.132
Ooh, I got you this.

300
00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.384
Oh, my god. I love you so much.

301
00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:47.236
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

302
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.581
Tori: Where's Jay?

303
00:11:48.615 --> 00:11:50.616
He's in the back, freshening up.

304
00:11:50.651 --> 00:11:53.375
You know, he just gets
a little musty.

305
00:11:53.409 --> 00:11:55.444
He gets a little musty?

306
00:11:55.478 --> 00:11:57.040
- You got a lot going on.
- Musty she says.

307
00:11:57.064 --> 00:11:58.592
Lahna: Yeah, you know
all about that, right?

308
00:11:58.616 --> 00:11:59.661
- No, I do.
- You know all about that?

309
00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.271
- Baby.
- Yeah.

310
00:12:01.306 --> 00:12:02.489
You know all about
a little musty must?

311
00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:04.168
I got a stinky dick.

312
00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:06.409
- That's so fucked up.
- Cute, right?

313
00:12:06.444 --> 00:12:07.892
- Bitch.
- Yeah?

314
00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:09.513
You already cracked this open.

315
00:12:09.548 --> 00:12:12.238
We may have had, like,
like a couple of drinks.

316
00:12:12.272 --> 00:12:15.583
This is the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

317
00:12:15.617 --> 00:12:17.893
I know. I know. It's very nice.
And listen.

318
00:12:17.927 --> 00:12:19.559
Because we love you.
We didn't buy it for you.

319
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:21.686
We're giving it to you.

320
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:24.272
- Well, merry fucking Christmas.
- Merry fucking Christmas.

321
00:12:24.307 --> 00:12:27.169
- Baby!
- On it. Jesus Christ!

322
00:12:27.203 --> 00:12:28.376
- Hey!
- This motherfucker.

323
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.618
I haven't seen you in so long.

324
00:12:29.653 --> 00:12:31.308
- How are you?
- Oh, yeah. Right?

325
00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:32.963
- How are you?
- Hey, bro.

326
00:12:32.997 --> 00:12:34.318
- Hey, buddy. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

327
00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:35.928
- You look good.
- Thank you.

328
00:12:35.963 --> 00:12:37.491
- Yeah, you do.
- I've been doing nothing but

329
00:12:37.515 --> 00:12:40.135
selling toys and fucking
living the clean life.

330
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.894
Keep up.

331
00:12:41.928 --> 00:12:45.032
Oh! Um, what's up with you two?
What's going on here?

332
00:12:45.066 --> 00:12:47.008
- Uh, just grabbing a drink.
- Just grabbing a drink.

333
00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:48.492
I had to talk her out
of some tinder trash.

334
00:12:48.516 --> 00:12:49.964
You didn't talk me
out of anything.

335
00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:51.250
What was his name?
Emmett... Emmett...

336
00:12:51.274 --> 00:12:52.595
- We don't have to talk...
- Emmett! Oh, shit!

337
00:12:52.619 --> 00:12:54.136
Tori: No, I think

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:25.153
- Really?
- Yeah.

506
00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:28.291
Wearing nothing but an apron.

507
00:18:31.326 --> 00:18:33.016
Jay: If I lose?

508
00:18:33.051 --> 00:18:36.016
Lahna: Oh, when you lose,

509
00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:38.672
you have to eat my
ass out on this throne.

510
00:18:38.706 --> 00:18:41.051
Jay: Well, why wait? Why don't
I eat it fuckin' right now?

511
00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:42.534
Daddy's hungry.

512
00:18:42.568 --> 00:18:44.913
Ah! Daddy!

513
00:18:44.947 --> 00:18:47.430
Oh!

514
00:18:47.465 --> 00:18:49.672
I can trace it back
every fucking time.

515
00:18:49.706 --> 00:18:52.914
The second they cut their hair,
they cut their worst record!

516
00:18:52.948 --> 00:18:55.983
Ah, it's just such
an absurd claim.

517
00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:59.397
It isn't... it's a fucking
absurdly correct claim.

518
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:01.707
Is what it is. Okay?

519
00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:03.638
Do you remember that fucking
study I showed you?

520
00:19:03.673 --> 00:19:06.259
- Oh, yeah. The scientist one.
- Yes, the fuckin' scientist one.

521
00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:08.914
The second that they cut
the hair of

522
00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:11.260
a native American person,
they lost, like,

523
00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:13.053
- all sense of intuition.
- Okay.

524
00:19:13.087 --> 00:19:14.512
- Like fucking all of it.
- First off.

525
00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:16.363
- And it's really scary.
- First off.

526
00:19:16.398 --> 00:19:19.191
Whatever bullshit fucking blog
you pulled that study off...

527
00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:20.915
- A government study, dude.
- Government.

528
00:19:20.949 --> 00:19:22.443
Has about as much merit as
the fucking Reddit thread.

529
00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:24.294
- Okay.
- Second off, second off,

530
00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:26.708
that has absolutely zero
fucking merit when it comes to

531
00:19:26.743 --> 00:19:29.226
talking about somebody's actual
musical ability.

532
00:19:29.261 --> 00:19:31.226
Okay. I'm going to go through
the fucking list.

533
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:32.537
- Okay, do it.
- Metallica.

534
00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:34.192
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

535
00:19:34.226 --> 00:19:36.606
They cut their hair,
the fuckers release "load."

536
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.295
Yeah? Soundgarden.
Cornell cuts his hair off.

537
00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:43.399
Opts for the Spencers gift tips
with the frosted spikes,

538
00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.468
and then the motherfuckers
release "superunknown"!

539
00:19:45.502 --> 00:19:48.434
- What is that?!
- Boom! Boom right there, bitch!

540
00:19:48.469 --> 00:19:50.020
Voids your argument?
Do you know why?

541
00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:53.710
- Why? Tell me why.
- 'Cause "superunknown",

542
00:19:53.745 --> 00:19:55.365
- peak soundgarden.
- Oh, fuckin'...

543
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.548
- Are you kidding me?
- Not one bad track on the album.

544
00:19:57.572 --> 00:19:59.272
Tori: Are you actually going to
stop with the fucking

545
00:19:59.296 --> 00:20:00.951
Jesus Christ pose right now?

546
00:20:00.986 --> 00:20:02.538
What the fuck?!
Are you serious?!

547
00:20:02.572 --> 00:20:04.607
Are you fuckin'...

548
00:20:04.641 --> 00:20:06.986
Are you fucking kidding me?

549
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.263
That's so fuckin' dumb,
so fuckin' dumb.

550
00:20:10.297 --> 00:20:11.918
Let me guess.

551
00:20:11.952 --> 00:20:14.228
You prefer you prefer, uh,
you prefer Van hagar?

552
00:20:14.263 --> 00:20:18.297
"Prefer" is a strong word.
They lost zero appeal

553
00:20:18.332 --> 00:20:19.711
when diamond Dave ducked out.

554
00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:22.332
- Oh! Really?
- Yes, really.

555
00:20:22.366 --> 00:20:25.021
Because it's around that time
that they got

556
00:20:25.056 --> 00:20:27.643
rid of their guitar god,
and then replaced him

557
00:20:27.678 --> 00:20:30.712
with a synth loving clone
of said guitar god.

558
00:20:30.747 --> 00:20:33.022
Alright, get your ass
off the bar, Robbie.

559
00:20:33.057 --> 00:20:34.678
- Oh.
- Hate to break up the party.

560
00:20:34.712 --> 00:20:36.678
I got four little
diaper pissers at home.

561
00:20:36.712 --> 00:20:38.550
They're going to wake me
up in four hours. Let's...

562
00:20:38.574 --> 00:20:40.264
Yes, thank you.

563
00:20:40.298 --> 00:20:42.402
I don't want to listen to this
fucking guy anyway.

564
00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:44.195
- Sweet baby. Jesus.
- Mm, got my card.

565
00:20:44.229 --> 00:20:47.299
Slow your roll, Larry.
Got two more coming my way.

566
00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.920
- I'll pour you one.
- Hands behind your back.

567
00:20:49.954 --> 00:20:52.368
- Hands behind my back?
- You're lucky like you.

568
00:20:52.403 --> 00:20:54.506
Yeah, and you're lucky I don't
have health inspector

569
00:20:54.541 --> 00:20:55.575
shut this shit hole down.

570
00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.679
He's right.

571
00:20:58.713 --> 00:21:00.299
Is he right?

572
00:21:00.334 --> 00:21:04.334
- And pour Tori and her new Beau.
- Oh, thanks, man.

573
00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:07.990
One and one for yourself, Larry.

574
00:21:08.024 --> 00:21:10.300
I didn't know
you two were a thing.

575
00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:11.438
- We're not.
- Yet.

576
00:21:11.473 --> 00:21:13.507
Get fucked.

577
00:21:17.473 --> 00:21:19.300
Lahna: Ah, yeah!

578
00:21:45.095 --> 00:21:47.923
Monroe: The wife's back
is with her family.

579
00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:55.957
So that's why I'm spending
Christmas alone.

580
00:21:55.992 --> 00:21:58.302
Unless you count
that fucking mutt

581
00:21:58.337 --> 00:21:59.682
that won't keep its trap shut.

582
00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:01.406
Why do you have a fucking
dog then, man?

583
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.372
You think I wanted that thing?

584
00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:06.165
- That's all Donna.
- Okay.

585
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.648
That little son of a whore
is like an angel around her.

586
00:22:08.683 --> 00:22:11.717
But with me, just me,
it won't shut the fuck up

587
00:22:11.752 --> 00:22:14.269
because I won't spoil him,
like Donna does.

588
00:22:14.303 --> 00:22:15.958
Just like with her old man.

589
00:22:15.993 --> 00:22:18.003
Yeah, I think... I think it
sounds like the dog just

590
00:22:18.027 --> 00:22:20.407
probably needs, like, some
lovin' from daddy Monroe.

591
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:22.373
- Like.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:22:22.408 --> 00:22:25.339
I think the little bastard needs
his balls clipped.

593
00:22:25.373 --> 00:22:27.304
- Hey, man.
- Sure.

594
00:22:27.339 --> 00:22:29.063
Donna had me get
my balls clipped

595
00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:32.994
- two days after Henry was born.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

596
00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:38.097
You're gonna wake up
a sleeping, junior.

597
00:22:38.132 --> 00:22:41.098
Well, uh, here,
let's have a toast.

598
00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:43.616
I think you've had enough
there, supercuts.

599
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.340
Cheers.

600
00:22:45.374 --> 00:22:48.616
Cheers.

601
00:22:50.409 --> 00:22:54.098
Here, let me, uh, cover
what these kids are drinking.

602
00:22:54.133 --> 00:22:57.271
- Oh, no, no, that's...
- No, hey, hey, hey, hey.

603
00:22:57.305 --> 00:22:58.685
- You...
- Thank you, chief.

604
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:02.375
- Keep the rest for yourself.
- Thank you.

605
00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.651
Monroe: Watch yourself
with that one.

606
00:23:04.686 --> 00:23:06.134
Merry Christmas, sheriff.

607
00:23:06.168 --> 00:23:08.375
Shit, that little punk
motherfucker,

608
00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.306
wipe that smirk off...

609
00:23:10.341 --> 00:23:13.237
Mm. That sucked the
fucking Christmas early.

610
00:23:13.272 --> 00:23:15.961
Robbie: God damn, what a sad
fuckin' human being.

611
00:23:15.996 --> 00:23:19.100
Larry: You gonna be
good to drive?

612
00:23:19.135 --> 00:23:20.652
Uh, no.

613
00:23:20.687 --> 00:23:23.100
I drove with Robbie...
I fuckin' walked with Robbie.

614
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:24.549
If I drove you, you'd be fucked.

615
00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:26.352
So much for drinking
every guy under the table.

616
00:23:26.376 --> 00:23:30.411
Excuse me. You've got, like,
at least five pounds on me.

617
00:23:30.445 --> 00:23:31.997
Soaking wet maybe.

618
00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:33.283
Larry: Get her home safe.
Robbie.

619
00:23:33.307 --> 00:23:34.928
What the fuck's that's
supposed to mean?

620
00:23:34.962 --> 00:23:36.962
- It's a big world out there.
- You get home safe.

621
00:23:36.997 --> 00:23:39.101
Better watch for your children.

622
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.412
- I'm just kidding.
- Sounded so threatening.

623
00:23:42.446 --> 00:23:44.895
- Good night.
- Thank you, Larry.

624
00:23:47.446 --> 00:23:49.722
- Ugh.
- Come on.

625
00:23:52.757 --> 00:23:54.205
Lahna: Yes!

626
00:23:55.446 --> 00:23:56.689
Jay: Oh, shit.

627
00:23:56.723 --> 00:23:58.447
Lahna: Not yet.

628
00:23:58.482 --> 00:23:59.999
Jay: It's coming early.

629
00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:00.999
Lahna: Hold it.
No, baby, hold it.

630
00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.033
Hold it! You better not!

631
00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:04.413
Fuck! You better not!

632
00:24:04.447 --> 00:24:06.309
Ah!

633
00:24:07.964 --> 00:24:10.137
Like, what did
he arrest you for?

634
00:24:10.171 --> 00:24:12.378
It was fucking...
You were like...

635
00:24:12.413 --> 00:24:14.206
You were like pissing
on a playground.

636
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.114
I didn't know the kid
was going to show up like that.

637
00:24:16.138 --> 00:24:17.931
Oh, fuck, and the kid
was his grandson.

638
00:24:17.965 --> 00:24:19.310
Yeah, I made him a man.

639
00:24:19.345 --> 00:24:20.941
That's fucked.
You took that away from him.

640
00:24:20.965 --> 00:24:22.517
- I know.
- You took it away him.

641
00:24:41.104 --> 00:24:44.208
Somebody help!

642
00:24:44.242 --> 00:24:45.563
Do you want to keep drinking,
or...?

643
00:24:45.587 --> 00:24:48.691
I mean, yeah.
What are you thinking?

644
00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:50.449
- What am I thinking?
- Yeah.

645
00:25:07.347 --> 00:25:10.105
You can come over
and kill that bottle with me.

646
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.485
- Really?
- Yeah.

647
00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:12.967
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

648
00:25:13.002 --> 00:25:14.934
Come kill the fucking bottle.

649
00:25:14.968 --> 00:25:17.210
I said come over for a drink,
not over for a fuck.

650
00:25:22.382 --> 00:25:24.862
Well, it sounds like someone's
hankering for a little bit of...

651
00:25:28.451 --> 00:25:30.520
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

652
00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:42.142
Yeah, dawg!

653
00:25:42.176 --> 00:25:44.383
Jay hitting that pipe.

654
00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:45.739
Yeah, he's hitting
that fucking pipe.

655
00:25:45.763 --> 00:25:47.176
Speaking of, have you seen it?

656
00:25:47.211 --> 00:25:49.038
Yeah, it's fucking fat as fuck.

657
00:25:49.073 --> 00:25:51.073
- It's fat.
- Oh, he be gaping that shit

658
00:25:51.107 --> 00:25:52.695
for sure.

659
00:26:05.281 --> 00:26:07.005
How old are you, fuckin' 12?

660
00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:08.498
I can see you smoking
that blunt from here!

661
00:26:08.522 --> 00:26:10.696
- I didn't fuckin' ask...
- I said give it to me!

662
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.385
I need to salvage
this Lincoln log...

663
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.730
- No!
- Before you run it into

664
00:26:15.765 --> 00:26:17.282
the fuckin' ground.

665
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.006
Yeah, I want to fuckin'
salvage this thing.

666
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.603
What are we watching when
we get to yours,

667
00:26:24.627 --> 00:26:26.316
"a Christmas story"?

668
00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:28.120
What is your fucking obsession
with "a Christmas story"?

669
00:26:28.144 --> 00:26:29.500
What's your issue
with "a Christmas story"?

670
00:26:29.524 --> 00:26:31.052
You're the one that
brought it up earlier.

671
00:26:31.076 --> 00:26:32.524
Everyone's obsessed with it.

672
00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.155
If you want to watch
a Bob Clark Christmas movie

673
00:26:34.179 --> 00:26:36.662
will watch
fucking "black Christmas."

674
00:26:36.697 --> 00:26:39.179
Oh, that...
That blumhouse joint?

675
00:26:39.214 --> 00:26:41.662
I'm just going to
drive myself home.

676
00:26:41.697 --> 00:26:43.500
No, no, no. You said we were
going to my car...

677
00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:45.662
If you want to go home
and fucking jerk off

678
00:26:45.697 --> 00:26:48.190
- to fucking blumhouse movies...
- Get your fuckin' ass over here.

679
00:26:48.214 --> 00:26:50.260
Okay, but are you done spewing
garbage out of your fuckin'

680
00:26:50.284 --> 00:26:51.629
- whore mouth?
- Oh, there it is.

681
00:26:51.663 --> 00:26:53.456
There's your fuckin'
Rhode Island accent.

682
00:26:53.491 --> 00:26:55.698
I maybe sound like
I'm from Rhode Island,

683
00:26:55.732 --> 00:26:58.422
but at least I don't have
shit taste in movies,

684
00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:02.973
shit opinions on everything,
and drive a fucking shit car.

685
00:27:03.008 --> 00:27:04.467
Robbie: Uh, excuse me,
this is basically

686
00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:05.939
the same as your fucking car.

687
00:27:05.973 --> 00:27:07.122
Don't say that about her.
She's beautiful.

688
00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:08.699
- Also...
- I get her first.

689
00:27:08.733 --> 00:27:10.399
Robbie: My lady. My lady.
You got to get in on this side.

690
00:27:10.423 --> 00:27:12.181
You haven't got
this fucking car fixed yet?

691
00:27:12.216 --> 00:27:13.561
Robbie: With what you pay me,

692
00:27:13.595 --> 00:27:16.078
you think I can afford
a fucking door?

693
00:27:16.112 --> 00:27:17.940
What are you doing
with your paychecks?

694
00:27:17.974 --> 00:27:19.433
- This is...
- My minimum, my minimum...

695
00:27:19.457 --> 00:27:20.940
That's embarrassing.

696
00:27:20.974 --> 00:27:22.295
Robbie: My minimum
fucking wage paycheck.

697
00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:23.709
Yeah, your minimum
fucking wage paycheck.

698
00:27:23.733 --> 00:27:25.009
- Get it.
- That should be

699
00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:26.975
- a fucking priority.
- Please.

700
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.458
- Wow.
- Lady.

701
00:27:28.493 --> 00:27:31.010
No, I changed my fucking mind.
I changed my mind.

702
00:27:31.044 --> 00:27:32.572
Hop in, hot shot.
We got fucking whiskey waiting.

703
00:27:32.596 --> 00:27:34.148
- Get in.
- Oh, whiskey you say?

704
00:27:34.182 --> 00:27:35.389
- Yes.
- Okay, in that case,

705
00:27:35.424 --> 00:27:37.251
- shut your fucking mouth.
- Oh, this mouth.

706
00:27:37.286 --> 00:27:39.493
This fucking whore mouth
and that devil's tongue, baby.

707
00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:43.217
- Ew, shut the... Robbie.
- Come on, what?

708
00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:44.676
- This is a...
- Get your fuckin' ass in.

709
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.735
Don't touch my fuckin' ass.

710
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.563
She got a bit of a fight in her.
All right.

711
00:27:48.597 --> 00:27:52.011
- Call fucking H.R.
- I'll give you space.

712
00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:53.563
No wonder you don't
get fuckin' laid.

713
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.666
- Look at this.
- What?

714
00:27:57.701 --> 00:27:59.252
No wonder you don't
get fucking laid.

715
00:27:59.287 --> 00:28:01.390
- This is disgusting.
- It adds to the flavor.

716
00:28:01.425 --> 00:28:04.666
Adds to the flavor of what?
A fucking chicken Coop.

717
00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:07.391
This is fucked up.

718
00:28:07.426 --> 00:28:09.540
Some empty cans and bottles.
That's Tori tooms' break?

719
00:28:09.564 --> 00:28:11.426
No, but it's the nail
in the fucking coffin

720
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.184
because this is really bad.

721
00:28:13.219 --> 00:28:15.391
- Come on, baby.
- How do you live like this?

722
00:28:15.426 --> 00:28:17.288
- Let's cowboy up.
- Just take my car.

723
00:28:17.322 --> 00:28:20.046
Just take my fucking card.

724
00:28:20.081 --> 00:28:22.012
You just got to be patient
with her.

725
00:28:22.046 --> 00:28:24.634
I'm gonna lose my buzz.

726
00:28:27.737 --> 00:28:29.530
- Hey!
- Oh, god.

727
00:28:29.565 --> 00:28:32.461
- Jesus.
- Feel that between my pants.

728
00:28:32.496 --> 00:28:34.575
We're going to have to roll this
up the hill ourselves.

729
00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:37.185
- Alright.
- Whoa. Jesus fucking Christ.

730
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.496
I don't feel safe.
What are you... okay.

731
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.427
She's road worthy.
Don't even worry about it.

732
00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:44.704
Tori: Okay! Here we go.

733
00:29:08.498 --> 00:29:11.498
Oh, if this guy parks his
fucking ranchero here

734
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:13.256
one more time,
I'm going to total it,

735
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:15.256
smash out his fucking windows.

736
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:17.118
Robbie: Little harsh
to the griswolds.

737
00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:18.750
Tori: No, it's boozin' Benny
down at the bottom of the hill.

738
00:29:18.774 --> 00:29:20.705
- He's a fucking alcoholic.
- Boozin' Benny.

739
00:29:20.739 --> 00:29:22.395
Tori: Just pull up behind
my sister's car.

740
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:24.016
Robbie: Wait.
Your sister is here?

741
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.578
Tori: Do you not listen
to a fucking thing I say?

742
00:29:25.602 --> 00:29:27.475
Robbie: Well, I mean, I listen,
but I don't retain.

743
00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:29.499
Tori: Yeah, well, I don't want
to retain the stink

744
00:29:29.533 --> 00:29:31.671
from this fucking chicken Coop,
so get out.

745
00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:33.361
Come on, let's go drink.

746
00:29:33.395 --> 00:29:36.085
- Beautiful.
- Oh, Jesus.

747
00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:38.292
- All right, my lady.
- Listen, I really can't...

748
00:29:38.326 --> 00:29:40.499
Please exit your chariot.

749
00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:42.396
I honestly... i'm... whoa.

750
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:44.362
I'm too drunk for this. Jesus.

751
00:29:44.396 --> 00:29:46.534
Walk carefully, please.
Thank you.

752
00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:49.569
And treat her
with respect and dignity.

753
00:29:55.396 --> 00:29:57.155
Uh, welcome to my humble abode.

754
00:29:57.189 --> 00:29:58.741
Yeah, it's cute. It's uh...

755
00:29:58.776 --> 00:30:01.225
Charming, classy, cute.
I know.

756
00:30:01.259 --> 00:30:02.742
- Yeah, sure.
- Extravagant.

757
00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:04.363
- Rustic.
- Yeah.

758
00:30:04.397 --> 00:30:06.949
Humble. Barn-like.

759
00:30:06.983 --> 00:30:09.432
I really hope we don't take
my sister out because

760
00:30:09.466 --> 00:30:12.294
I don't want to have
to awkwardly introduce you.

761
00:30:12.328 --> 00:30:15.397
Wait, so are we drinking
alone tonight, or what?

762
00:30:15.432 --> 00:30:17.397
Robbie, do not fucking
listen to me?

763
00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:18.708
They're out cold.

764
00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:20.433
Out cold already?
It's not even midnight.

765
00:30:20.467 --> 00:30:22.685
Plus, my lame ass brother in law
doesn't even drink, so...

766
00:30:22.709 --> 00:30:26.467
Oh, that fucking cunt Mike.
Yeah?

767
00:30:26.502 --> 00:30:29.122
Mr. Hollywood? Yeah.

768
00:30:32.743 --> 00:30:37.053
These goddamn neighbors and
their fucking obnoxious lights.

769
00:30:37.088 --> 00:30:39.537
Hey, Tori.

770
00:30:39.572 --> 00:30:42.537
How much music was there
in "unsolved mysteries"?

771
00:30:42.572 --> 00:30:44.468
- What?
- I mean, like, I don't...

772
00:30:44.503 --> 00:30:46.237
I don't want to...
I don't want to scare you,

773
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:49.123
like, in your own home,
but there's like six hours

774
00:30:49.158 --> 00:30:50.755
worth of the
"unsolved mysteries" soundtrack?

775
00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:53.951
What the fuck is your problem
with "unsolved mysteries"?

776
00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:56.054
I mean, like, 30 second intro,
and then, like,

777
00:30:56.089 --> 00:30:57.538
do you need six hours?

778
00:30:57.573 --> 00:30:59.366
Tori: Have you heard it?

779
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.504
No, not the entire fucking
expanse of isolated soundtrack.

780
00:31:02.538 --> 00:31:05.400
Oh, well, it is the fucking
creepiest goddamn synth pads

781
00:31:05.435 --> 00:31:08.021
you will ever hear
in your fucking life.

782
00:31:08.055 --> 00:31:09.952
- Mm-hmm. Right.
- They're amazing. Put it on.

783
00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:11.962
Yeah, okay. No, I've already got
something queued up.

784
00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:13.514
No, put it on. I want you to get
like soaked up and like

785
00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.721
- immersed in it.
- No, no, no, I'm good.

786
00:31:14.745 --> 00:31:16.505
- I'm good.
- It's so good. Please.

787
00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:18.343
Robbie. All right, fine. At
least I know it won't be "load."

788
00:31:18.367 --> 00:31:21.263
- Oh, I know. I already looked.
- Oh, did you?

789
00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:24.953
Of course.
Oh, come on, Robbie.

790
00:31:24.987 --> 00:31:28.022
"Rhythms from a cosmic sky" is,
like, at least four times...

791
00:31:28.056 --> 00:31:29.608
Oh, you're the worst
fuckin' opinion.

792
00:31:29.643 --> 00:31:31.653
No, everybody knows that.
What are you talking about?

793
00:31:31.677 --> 00:31:33.470
Uh, it's in your collection.

794
00:31:33.505 --> 00:31:34.653
Yeah, because I'm a completist.
Thank you.

795
00:31:34.677 --> 00:31:37.057
- Not for metallica.
- Shut up.

796
00:31:37.092 --> 00:31:40.540
Follow... get that
fucking thing away from me.

797
00:31:40.575 --> 00:31:43.264
Okay.

798
00:31:43.299 --> 00:31:45.609
I'm weirdly turned on by this.

799
00:31:45.644 --> 00:31:47.713
- Really?
- But I need you to stop.

800
00:32:05.024 --> 00:32:08.265
Man: Hey, Freddy.
Buddy, let's not open gifts.

801
00:32:10.024 --> 00:32:11.438
There's absolutely
no fucking way

802
00:32:11.472 --> 00:32:12.724
that you actually think
that "pet sematary 2"

803
00:32:12.748 --> 00:32:14.439
is better than
the fucking first one!

804
00:32:14.473 --> 00:32:17.094
It's twice is good, if not
fucking three times, okay?

805
00:32:17.128 --> 00:32:20.577
It's good. Not better.
Not better. No.

806
00:32:20.611 --> 00:32:23.404
Edward furlong,
Clancy fucking brown.

807
00:32:23.439 --> 00:32:26.335
Who, by the way, chews up
scenery like it's a piece of

808
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.646
fucking gum,
and that soundtrack.

809
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.163
They've got 12 tracks
of female fronted

810
00:32:31.197 --> 00:32:34.991
fucking aggressive as hell,
early '90s grunge!

811
00:32:35.026 --> 00:32:36.761
Traci lords has three goddamn
songs on the album,

812
00:32:36.785 --> 00:32:38.509
and they're fucking good,
they're so good.

813
00:32:38.543 --> 00:32:40.991
So, you think it's better
because Traci lords, porn star,

814
00:32:41.026 --> 00:32:45.060
fucking superstar, big titty
Traci lords has, what, like,

815
00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:47.095
fuckin' two tracks on the album.

816
00:32:47.129 --> 00:32:50.302
No, three, by the way,
and better story.

817
00:32:50.336 --> 00:32:53.303
Better music, obviously.
Better kills.

818
00:32:53.337 --> 00:32:57.544
Better makeup,
better fucking cast and...

819
00:32:57.579 --> 00:33:01.475
Lord Gwynn aside,
I will say, you got me there.

820
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.061
But Mary lambert, she was
finally given free reign.

821
00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:05.624
- Yeah, that was a mistake.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

822
00:33:05.648 --> 00:33:07.441
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What?

823
00:33:07.475 --> 00:33:10.337
What fucking neanderthal puts
salsa on nachos

824
00:33:10.372 --> 00:33:12.304
- before they cook them?
- Me.

825
00:33:12.338 --> 00:33:15.131
Man: Freddy, put it away
and get to bed.

826
00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:22.442
- "Elm street."
- Part 6, "Freddy's dead."

827
00:33:22.476 --> 00:33:24.373
- Come the fuck on.
- Yeah.

828
00:33:24.407 --> 00:33:26.580
Whoa! Hellraiser?

829
00:33:26.614 --> 00:33:28.269
- "Hell on earth."
- Child's play?

830
00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:29.994
- 2.
- Alien?

831
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:33.132
- "Covenant."
- oh, no, no, no.

832
00:33:33.167 --> 00:33:35.546
- Yes.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

833
00:33:35.581 --> 00:33:39.477
- okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Okay.

834
00:33:39.512 --> 00:33:40.753
Blair witch?

835
00:33:40.788 --> 00:33:43.270
-Book of motherfucking
shadows", bitch?

836
00:33:43.305 --> 00:33:45.350
It's a fucking classic,
and you're going to watch it,

837
00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:48.477
and you'll... stop.
You'll get it. I promise.

838
00:33:48.512 --> 00:33:50.306
Do you use your little
fucking fingers, like,

839
00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:51.730
typing on the keyboard,
and you're like,

840
00:33:51.754 --> 00:33:53.168
"oh, like Reddit,
Reddit thread."

841
00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:54.651
-Shut the fuck up.
No, no, I am like,

842
00:33:54.685 --> 00:33:56.547
I am a gal with fucking
strong opinions.

843
00:33:56.582 --> 00:33:58.168
And now we're going to take
a shot to

844
00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.351
"book of"
motherfuckin' "shadows"

845
00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:01.306
because it's so good.

846
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.237
Ah.

847
00:34:33.032 --> 00:34:34.549
Oh, fuck.

848
00:34:45.618 --> 00:34:47.171
Jesus.

849
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.067
Man: Freddy, that better
not be you.

850
00:34:59.102 --> 00:35:01.723
If you're opening those gifts,
I swear to god.

851
00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:08.275
Hey, you know what happens
if I come down there.

852
00:35:16.999 --> 00:35:18.413
Oh!

853
00:35:18.448 --> 00:35:20.241
Oh, my god.

854
00:35:20.275 --> 00:35:22.379
Robbie: Sorry, sorry.

855
00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:25.518
Fuck it.

856
00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:31.207
Man: Freddy?
Freddy, is that you, buddy?

857
00:35:31.242 --> 00:35:33.690
Said we weren't gonna open
or touch any of these gifts

858
00:35:33.725 --> 00:35:35.483
till Santa got...

859
00:35:40.035 --> 00:35:43.138
Get the fuck out of my house.
I'm calling the cops right now.

860
00:35:43.173 --> 00:35:45.070
Oh, shit!

861
00:35:54.553 --> 00:35:56.415
Wait.

862
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.140
Oh, king shit.

863
00:38:20.285 --> 00:38:22.251
Frankie, what was...

864
00:38:33.527 --> 00:38:34.734
Frankie!

865
00:38:39.597 --> 00:38:42.183
Oh, what the fuck?

866
00:38:44.079 --> 00:38:45.217
That was...

867
00:38:47.459 --> 00:38:49.183
Unexpected.

868
00:38:49.217 --> 00:38:51.562
Too bad find out
about that earlier.

869
00:38:51.597 --> 00:38:53.942
Yeah, it's too bad.

870
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.425
This thing is usda approved
organic prime man meat.

871
00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.529
Sorry, are you asking me
to peg you?

872
00:39:12.563 --> 00:39:15.702
I'm not asking.
I'm inviting.

873
00:39:15.737 --> 00:39:18.185
Please, sir, may I have a hit?

874
00:39:25.047 --> 00:39:27.254
No! Pl... aah!

875
00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:31.116
Tori: I'm gonna get some more
whiskey, flip the record.

876
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.565
Come back up.
Don't fucking move.

877
00:39:41.531 --> 00:39:44.255
Boy: Mom?

878
00:39:46.807 --> 00:39:48.565
Mommy?

879
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.565
You okay?

880
00:39:57.601 --> 00:39:59.704
Santa?

881
00:39:59.739 --> 00:40:01.532
Where's mommy?

882
00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:09.049
Did you bring me
any good presents?

883
00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:10.704
You did!

884
00:40:50.224 --> 00:40:52.500
Oh. Fuck, fuck!

885
00:40:52.535 --> 00:40:54.673
Fuck me.

886
00:40:54.707 --> 00:40:56.466
Damn it.

887
00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:59.742
Jesus.

888
00:41:02.638 --> 00:41:04.431
That's fucked.

889
00:41:20.053 --> 00:41:23.501
Not stupid clothes again.

890
00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:31.364
Why are you so bloody?

891
00:41:32.502 --> 00:41:34.433
Mommy?

892
00:41:37.778 --> 00:41:39.985
Mom!

893
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:49.365
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

894
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.745
- This guy...
- Tori!

895
00:41:50.779 --> 00:41:53.055
I think he maybe
just killed the kid next door.

896
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:54.641
What the hell are you
talking about?

897
00:41:54.676 --> 00:41:57.296
Oh, fuck.

898
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:05.055
Oh, fuck!

899
00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:07.263
Call the fucking cops now.
Come on.

900
00:42:07.297 --> 00:42:10.194
Fuck. Have you seen my phone?
Fuck! Get my phone!

901
00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:12.746
- It's upstairs.
- Shit. Is your phone down here?

902
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.435
Robbie, go! Find a phone!

903
00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:29.540
Robbie? He's gone.

904
00:42:29.574 --> 00:42:30.747
Robbie: What?

905
00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.436
Robbie, he's fucking gone.

906
00:42:32.471 --> 00:42:34.436
He saw us. The fucker's gonna
come over here.

907
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:35.723
Find a phone
and get the fuck out.

908
00:42:35.747 --> 00:42:37.505
I have to get my sister.

909
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.264
Liddy, Mike, wake the fuck up.
Get your asses out of bed.

910
00:42:40.298 --> 00:42:42.022
There's no time to explain.
Come on, we...

911
00:42:42.057 --> 00:42:43.516
- Come on. We have to go.
- What is going on?

912
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:45.161
Uh, uh, where's your phone?

913
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.265
It's up there.
There weren't any outlets.

914
00:42:47.299 --> 00:42:49.023
Okay. Get out of bed.
Put your shoes on.

915
00:42:49.058 --> 00:42:50.541
Put your shoes on now.
Come on.

916
00:42:50.575 --> 00:42:52.437
Mike, get the fuck up.
I'm trying to help you.

917
00:42:52.472 --> 00:42:54.103
- Alright, alright.
- Does it look like I'm joking?

918
00:42:54.127 --> 00:42:56.092
You fucking idiot!
Get out of bed!

919
00:42:58.437 --> 00:42:59.689
All right, come on, move it.
You should go.

920
00:42:59.713 --> 00:43:01.989
No, you go.
Mike, get the fuck out.

921
00:43:02.023 --> 00:43:03.058
- Alright.
- Go!

922
00:43:03.092 --> 00:43:05.300
Fuck you, go.

923
00:43:05.335 --> 00:43:06.690
Robbie: I have no idea
what the fuck my phone is.

924
00:43:06.714 --> 00:43:08.507
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

925
00:43:13.783 --> 00:43:16.059
Where are you keys?

926
00:43:16.093 --> 00:43:17.542
I don't know.

927
00:43:17.576 --> 00:43:19.380
I must have left them
in the truck or something.

928
00:43:19.404 --> 00:43:21.138
Well, if they're not in the
fucking truck, where are they?

929
00:43:21.162 --> 00:43:22.681
I don't fucking know, do I?

930
00:43:22.715 --> 00:43:24.726
Liddy, do you have your keys?
Your fucking keys, liddy?

931
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:26.784
- Where are they?
- Get the keys.

932
00:43:26.819 --> 00:43:28.553
The keys? What do you
want with the fuckin'...

933
00:43:28.577 --> 00:43:30.163
Shut the fuck up, you cunt.

934
00:43:30.198 --> 00:43:32.025
Okay. Do you want me
to get the keys or not?

935
00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:33.174
- Yes.
- Fine. I'll get the keys.

936
00:43:33.198 --> 00:43:34.750
Jesus.

937
00:43:39.336 --> 00:43:41.544
Did anybody see where he went?

938
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.682
Okay.

939
00:43:46.716 --> 00:43:49.199
Okay, okay, okay.

940
00:43:49.233 --> 00:43:51.026
We're going to go
to the basement.

941
00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.796
- What if it's in the basement?
- Then we don't have

942
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:56.061
anywhere to go, do we?

943
00:43:56.095 --> 00:43:57.475
Okay, hang on.

944
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:02.210
Mike: All right, I got the keys.

945
00:44:02.234 --> 00:44:03.614
- Shh!
- Look, I didn't even

946
00:44:03.648 --> 00:44:05.096
want to come here
in the first...

947
00:44:05.131 --> 00:44:06.752
Shut the fuck up, Mike.
Shut the fuck up.

948
00:45:20.411 --> 00:45:22.307
Get up!

949
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:25.790
Run!

950
00:45:25.825 --> 00:45:28.445
Get out!

951
00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:37.722
Tori: Go! Fucking! Go!

952
00:45:40.274 --> 00:45:41.722

Okay.

- I need my sister...
- Listen to me. Listen to me.

961
00:46:07.137 --> 00:46:09.009
Listen to me, listen.
Okay, she's not coming, okay?

962
00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:10.768
You've got to get in the car.
Okay? For me. Please.

Tori: I can't get out of the

Go, come on, let's go!

1015
00:48:36.766 --> 00:48:39.386
No, Robbie. You got to get up.

1016
00:48:39.421 --> 00:48:42.110
You got to get up right now.
Get up right now, come on!

1017
00:48:42.145 --> 00:48:45.007
Get your ass... get your ass up,
come on!

1018
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.249
Get the fuck up, Robbie!

1019
00:48:47.284 --> 00:48:49.629
Somebody help us!

1020
00:48:49.663 --> 00:48:51.594
Where the fuck is everyone?

1021
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:54.215
No! Robbie, Robbie,
he's coming back.

1022
00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:55.777
Come on, get up, get up.

1023
00:48:55.801 --> 00:48:57.732
Get it here, Robbie!

1024
00:48:57.767 --> 00:48:59.801
No! Behind you!

1025
00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.767
Behind you!

1026
00:49:01.801 --> 00:49:03.560
No!

1027
00:49:03.594 --> 00:49:06.526
Robbie!

1028
00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:13.319
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1029
00:49:13.354 --> 00:49:15.181
Hide!

1030
00:49:15.216 --> 00:49:16.595
Drop the weapon!

1031
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.457
Now!

1032
00:49:18.492 --> 00:49:19.664
Hey!

1033
00:49:19.699 --> 00:49:21.181
Don't come any closer!

1034
00:49:21.216 --> 00:49:22.388
Kill this motherfucker!

1035
00:49:22.423 --> 00:49:25.665
Drop the weapon now!

1036
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.424
This is officer Danny Davis.

1037
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:38.700
I got at least three people
down at 246 Chestnut.

1038
00:49:38.734 --> 00:49:42.389
Send back up
and an ambulance immediately.

1039
00:49:47.287 --> 00:49:49.183
It's gonna be okay.

1040
00:49:49.218 --> 00:49:50.494
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

1041
00:49:50.528 --> 00:49:54.390
It's okay. Help is on the way.

1042
00:49:54.425 --> 00:49:56.149
Help is on the way, okay?

1043
00:49:56.183 --> 00:49:59.114
- Are you sure he's dead?
- Yes. He's dead.

1044
00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:01.287
He's dead.

1045
00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:03.252
He's not getting up.

1046
00:50:05.046 --> 00:50:06.667
I got you.

1047
00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:11.184
Oh, Robbie.

1048
00:50:11.219 --> 00:50:13.288
- I got you.
- Oh, Robbie. Robbie!

1049
00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:15.367
It's okay, it's okay. Don't
look at him. Don't look at him.

1050
00:50:15.391 --> 00:50:19.460
Okay, stay calm.
Help is on the way, alright?

1051
00:50:22.772 --> 00:50:26.461
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna
be fi... watch your head.

1052
00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.221
Can you tell me what happened?

1053
00:50:43.255 --> 00:50:45.324
- You need to check the store.
- What?

1054
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:47.221
The toy store.
You need to check the toy store.

1055
00:50:47.255 --> 00:50:49.048
Why?

1056
00:50:49.083 --> 00:50:52.152
Because that thing looks exactly
like the Santa from the store.

1057
00:50:52.186 --> 00:50:54.290
You mean the t.W. Bonkers thing?

1058
00:50:54.324 --> 00:50:56.152
Yeah.

1059
00:50:56.186 --> 00:50:58.738
That fucking guy looks exactly
like the thing from the store.

1060
00:50:58.773 --> 00:51:00.566
I can assure it's not
on the same Santa.

1061
00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.705
No, no, that's... I'm saying
that maybe he took

1062
00:51:02.739 --> 00:51:04.498
the fucking suit or something.

1063
00:51:04.532 --> 00:51:07.567
And my friends, my friends were
staying the night there,

1064
00:51:07.601 --> 00:51:09.739
and... and maybe that fucker
killed them and then took

1065
00:51:09.774 --> 00:51:11.232
the fucking suit.
That's what I'm saying.

1066
00:51:11.256 --> 00:51:13.084
He didn't get that
thing anywhere.

1067
00:51:13.118 --> 00:51:14.532
You need to fucking check!
Okay?

1068
00:51:14.567 --> 00:51:16.232
- There's only a few of us, okay?
- I don't fucking care.

1069
00:51:16.256 --> 00:51:18.498
Listen to me. No one's been
fucking listening to me.

1070
00:51:18.532 --> 00:51:19.774
There's only a few of us!

1071
00:51:19.808 --> 00:51:21.775
You need to do
a fucking drive by!

1072
00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:23.647
- More people are gonna die!
- Once everything...

1073
00:51:23.671 --> 00:51:25.647
Once everything is all right,
I can go back and do a check.

1074
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:27.499
More people are gonna
fucking die!

1075
00:51:27.533 --> 00:51:30.085
Calm down.

1076
00:51:31.119 --> 00:51:33.464
Shoot him! Fucking shoot him!

1077
00:51:42.603 --> 00:51:47.431
Blow his fucking head off,
Davies, now!

1078
00:51:49.362 --> 00:51:50.569
He's done for!

1079
00:51:50.603 --> 00:51:52.534
Ah!

1080
00:51:52.569 --> 00:51:54.776
Davies?

1081
00:51:58.777 --> 00:52:02.501
Davies? Davies, get the fuck up!

1082
00:52:02.535 --> 00:52:06.432
Hey! Oh, you fuckin' idiot!
Come on!

1083
00:52:06.466 --> 00:52:08.328
Get up!

1084
00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:10.225
Behind you!

1085
00:52:10.259 --> 00:52:13.190
No, no, no, no, no!

1086
00:52:44.468 --> 00:52:46.054
Ho, ho, ho!

1087
00:52:46.089 --> 00:52:48.158
Merry Christmas.

1088
00:52:55.814 --> 00:52:57.607
Okay, okay.

1089
00:52:57.642 --> 00:52:59.055
Okay, okay, okay.

1090
00:53:02.055 --> 00:53:04.607
Hello?
Officer Davis was killed, okay?

1091
00:53:04.642 --> 00:53:06.400
He's fucking dead.
Is anyone there?

1092
00:53:07.676 --> 00:53:09.055
Listen to me.

1093
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.676
The officers going to
246 Chestnut

1094
00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:13.711
need to be fucking careful
because the killer is

1095
00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:16.367
still there, and he looks like
fucking Santa, okay?

1096
00:53:16.401 --> 00:53:17.574
He's in a Santa costume.

1097
00:53:17.608 --> 00:53:19.781
Fuck!

1098
00:53:19.815 --> 00:53:22.505
Oh, fuck.

1099
00:53:22.539 --> 00:53:25.712
Yes, go!

1100
00:53:27.436 --> 00:53:30.539
Hey! Hey!

1101
00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:33.229
Hey!

1102
00:53:33.263 --> 00:53:35.506
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1103
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.206
- Get on the ground!
- No, I've been calling you!

1104
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.506
Don't fuckin' move!
On the ground!

1105
00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:41.575
- Get on the ground!
- Get your hands on your head!

1106
00:53:41.609 --> 00:53:43.102
- I need your help!
- Hands on your head.

1107
00:53:43.126 --> 00:53:44.585
- I need your...
- Get your fucking hands

1108
00:53:44.609 --> 00:53:46.206
- on your head!
- Fine, I'm fucking sorry!

1109
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:47.689
Officer: Get your hands on
your fucking head!

1110
00:53:47.713 --> 00:53:49.275
- No, no, no, I need your help.
- Where's Davies?

1111
00:53:49.299 --> 00:53:51.402
I need your help.
I need your fucking help, man.

1112
00:53:51.437 --> 00:53:54.162
Where is Davies?
Get your hands behind your back.

1113
00:53:54.196 --> 00:53:55.817
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

1114
00:53:55.852 --> 00:53:57.724
- What did you just say?
- He's dead. He's fuckin' dead.

1115
00:53:57.748 --> 00:53:59.172
They're all fucking dead.

1116
00:53:59.196 --> 00:54:00.414
- Bullshit! Where is he!
- He's dead!

1117
00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:02.576
I've been trying to
fucking tell you!

1118
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:04.472
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything?

1119
00:54:04.507 --> 00:54:06.058
-I didn't do anything
-what did you do?

1120
00:54:06.093 --> 00:54:09.162
I need your fuckin' help!
I need your fuckin' help!

1121
00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:12.128
- Get up, sweetheart. Get up!
- I need... ah!

1122
00:54:12.163 --> 00:54:14.439
He's still there!

1123
00:54:14.473 --> 00:54:16.163
You need help, you need help.

1124
00:54:16.197 --> 00:54:18.473
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I call the shots!

1125
00:54:18.508 --> 00:54:20.542
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Weston, you get down

1126
00:54:20.577 --> 00:54:23.025
to Chestnut. I'm taking her...
I'm taking you in.

1127
00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:24.415
You can't alone.
You're gonna fuckin' die.

1128
00:54:24.439 --> 00:54:26.059
- Listen.
- You need to call in some...

1129
00:54:26.094 --> 00:54:27.784
- Hey!
- You got to fuckin listen to me.

1130
00:54:27.818 --> 00:54:29.784
You're gonna fucking die.
He killed everybody.

1131
00:54:29.818 --> 00:54:34.509
- You need back up!
- Get in the fuckin' car!

1132
00:54:34.543 --> 00:54:37.336
- You need back up!
- Fuck! Shut the fuck up.

1133
00:54:37.371 --> 00:54:38.830
What do you want to do
with Davies' car?

1134
00:54:38.854 --> 00:54:41.060
Nothing. Don't touch it.

1135
00:54:41.095 --> 00:54:42.578
Fucking crime scene.

1136
00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.509
I'll call and have it
towed into the station.

1137
00:54:44.543 --> 00:54:46.681
Alright. Be safe.

1138
00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:49.164
Tori: I need your fucking help.

1139
00:54:49.198 --> 00:54:53.544
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Do you fucking job.

1140
00:54:53.579 --> 00:54:57.544
Shut the fuck up!

1141
00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:03.061
You can't send him there alone.

1142
00:55:03.096 --> 00:55:05.820
I don't think you're in any
position to tell me what to do.

1143
00:55:05.855 --> 00:55:07.451
You know, you're in a world
of hurt, lady.

1144
00:55:07.475 --> 00:55:09.199
- No fucking...
- You're in a world

1145
00:55:09.234 --> 00:55:10.718
- of fucking shit.
- No fucking idea!

1146
00:55:10.752 --> 00:55:12.487
We caught you covered in blood
and a missing cop...

1147
00:55:12.511 --> 00:55:15.545
Man: Unit 17, Smith, you there?

1148
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.200
Yeah. This is unit 17.
This is Smith. Go ahead.

1149
00:55:18.235 --> 00:55:21.683
Man: This is Lenny.
We just got here.

1150
00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:24.545
It's a massacre, and we haven't
even been inside yet.

1151
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.590
Alright, copy that. Look, don't
make a move, alright?

1152
00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:30.201
Just hang back.
Weston's on his way down there.

1153
00:55:30.236 --> 00:55:31.753
Any word from renn county?

1154
00:55:31.788 --> 00:55:35.305
Man: Just us right now, sir.

1155
00:55:35.339 --> 00:55:39.305
Any sign of Davies?

1156
00:55:39.339 --> 00:55:41.374
Man: He's dead, sir.

1157
00:55:41.408 --> 00:55:46.167
Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucker!

1158
00:55:48.547 --> 00:55:51.271
I just saw you at Reggie's
three goddamn hours ago.

1159
00:55:51.306 --> 00:55:52.547
I don't understand.

1160
00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:54.478
What is there
to fucking understand?

1161
00:55:54.513 --> 00:55:57.064
What I don't understand
is the lax fucking attitude

1162
00:55:57.099 --> 00:55:58.478
when people are fucking dead.

1163
00:55:58.513 --> 00:56:00.340
Look, Tori, we know you didn't
murder anyone,

1164
00:56:00.375 --> 00:56:03.409
but we're having a hard time
believing what you're saying.

1165
00:56:03.444 --> 00:56:05.823
I'm having a hard time
fucking believing it. Okay?

1166
00:56:05.858 --> 00:56:08.755
But I saw it. I saw it
with my own goddamn eyes.

1167
00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:10.721
And my fucking eyes don't lie.
Okay, Monroe?

1168
00:56:10.755 --> 00:56:12.790
Listen, I can smell the weed
and whiskey on you

1169
00:56:12.824 --> 00:56:14.652
- from a mile away.
- Yeah. So fucking what?

1170
00:56:14.686 --> 00:56:17.134
I smoked some weed.
I had some fucking whiskey.

1171
00:56:17.169 --> 00:56:18.455
But that does not
make you hallucinate.

1172
00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:20.134
I promise you. I promise you.

1173
00:56:20.169 --> 00:56:22.410
After what I saw, I'm sober.
I'm sober as a fucking...

1174
00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.662
Oh, that's good you're sober.
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1175
00:56:24.686 --> 00:56:26.342
Ms. Tooms,
but it is still illegal.

1176
00:56:26.377 --> 00:56:29.170
Can you shut the fuck up?
Shut the fuck up!

1177
00:56:29.204 --> 00:56:31.480
My sister is dead!

1178
00:56:31.515 --> 00:56:33.135
Okay? My fucking friends
are dead.

1179
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.491
Not that you give
a fuck about him.

1180
00:56:34.515 --> 00:56:35.767
But what are you going
to do about it?

1181
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:37.308
- What do you...
- Hey! Hey!

1182
00:56:37.342 --> 00:56:39.308
The best goddamn officer
in this precinct is dead.

1183
00:56:39.342 --> 00:56:40.767
Now, if you want to be the one
to tell his widow.

1184
00:56:40.791 --> 00:56:42.629
Oh, fuck. Debbie.
Someone's got to tell Debbie.

1185
00:56:42.653 --> 00:56:44.480
Hey, hey, hey, Bobby.

1186
00:56:44.515 --> 00:56:46.043
We're all getting
a little emotional here.

1187
00:56:46.067 --> 00:56:48.688
Just cut it. Both of yous.
You, sit down.

1188
00:56:50.516 --> 00:56:53.550
Get this fucking
off your fucking desk.

1189
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:00.654
Have you heard from the boys
down at the scene yet?

1190
00:57:00.688 --> 00:57:02.274
Not since renn county showed up.

1191
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:04.586
They're still down
there counting bodies.

1192
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:07.482
Nothing about a killer
Santa claus either.

1193
00:57:07.517 --> 00:57:09.275
Monroe: Well, why don't you
give him a call?

1194
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:12.517
It's been a little while now.
See if they need any help.

1195
00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:14.068
I think they got it
under control.

1196
00:57:14.103 --> 00:57:15.724
Double check.

1197
00:57:22.137 --> 00:57:24.345
Fuck!

1198
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.552
You need to keep that asshole
away from me, Monroe.

1199
00:57:27.587 --> 00:57:30.276
He's worked with Davies
for over 15 years now.

1200
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:32.552
We're tight staff. Look around.

1201
00:57:32.587 --> 00:57:35.069
It's been a rough night
for all of us.

1202
00:57:35.104 --> 00:57:36.552
Bear with us.

1203
00:57:36.587 --> 00:57:38.725
We'll do the same.

1204
00:57:38.759 --> 00:57:40.794
Just breathe.

1205
00:57:48.312 --> 00:57:52.208
Okay, I'm going to brew
a fresh pot of coffee.

1206
00:57:52.243 --> 00:57:53.622
There's a bathroom down the hall

1207
00:57:53.657 --> 00:57:56.002
if you want to
clean yourself up some.

1208
00:58:57.591 --> 00:58:59.523
Smith: There is no
fucking back up, man.

1209
00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:02.040
Monroe: Just hold on a second.
Just hold on a second.

1210
00:59:02.074 --> 00:59:03.661
We got to think this out.

1211
00:59:03.695 --> 00:59:05.074
Tori: Oh, shit.

1212
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:06.316
Have tried the guys from renn?

1213
00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:10.523
Yep, renn, paramedics, Weston.

1214
00:59:10.557 --> 00:59:11.661
Nothing.

1215
00:59:11.695 --> 00:59:13.419
Chp? Anything?

1216
00:59:13.454 --> 00:59:15.040
- Nope.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

1217
00:59:15.074 --> 00:59:16.637
- What's going on?
- You coming with me or not?

1218
00:59:16.661 --> 00:59:19.144
Tori: Something happen? You guys
can't go back to my house.

1219
00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:20.800
- I told you.
- We're police, Tori.

1220
00:59:20.834 --> 00:59:22.593
- That's what we do.
- Well, no.

1221
00:59:22.627 --> 00:59:24.327
You need to call the fucking
national guard or something.

1222
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:26.593
He wiped everybody out.
He's going to wipe you out!

1223
00:59:26.627 --> 00:59:28.569
Hey, you know, Monroe,
maybe you should stay here.

1224
00:59:28.593 --> 00:59:30.213
You can, baby sit
the little girl.

1225
00:59:30.248 --> 00:59:31.534
Okay, you know what?
If you don't want to fucking

1226
00:59:31.558 --> 00:59:33.144
listen to me,
you go out there and die.

1227
00:59:33.179 --> 00:59:34.603
Because, quite frankly,
I don't fucking care.

1228
00:59:34.627 --> 00:59:37.283
Tori, we're going to go,
we're gonna lock the door.

1229
00:59:37.318 --> 00:59:39.525
- No, no.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1230
00:59:39.559 --> 00:59:41.387
What is that?

1231
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:43.352
Yeah. What the fuck is that?

1232
00:59:46.732 --> 00:59:48.352
That an ambulance?

1233
00:59:48.387 --> 00:59:51.214
Oh, fuck. It's him.

1234
00:59:51.249 --> 00:59:52.732
Oh, Santa claus?

1235
00:59:52.766 --> 00:59:54.363
- Yeah, it's fuckin' Santa claus.
- Fuckin' Santa claus!

1236
00:59:54.387 --> 00:59:57.077
It's the motherfucker
that killed everybody.

1237
00:59:57.112 --> 00:59:58.664
Okay, okay, uh...

1238
00:59:58.698 --> 01:00:00.457
- Oh, fuck.
- He's not stopping.

1239
01:00:00.491 --> 01:00:02.319
Fuck!

1240
01:00:13.836 --> 01:00:17.044
Fuck! Ah!

1241
01:00:17.078 --> 01:00:19.113
Monroe: Is everyone all right?

1242
01:00:19.147 --> 01:00:21.044
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

1243
01:00:21.078 --> 01:00:24.803
- Tori?
- Uh, yeah.

1244
01:00:28.078 --> 01:00:32.147
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck was that?

1245
01:00:32.182 --> 01:00:35.838
Hey, Tori, take these,
go to the holding room,

1246
01:00:35.873 --> 01:00:37.355
lock yourself in.

1247
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.390
No, no, no!
There's fucking people dead.

1248
01:00:39.424 --> 01:00:41.676
You need to give me a gun. You
need to give me a fucking gun.

1249
01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:43.504
- Where the driver?
- You're 38. Give her your 38.

1250
01:00:43.528 --> 01:00:45.183
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

1251
01:00:45.217 --> 01:00:47.257
- Give me your fucking gun.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1252
01:00:47.286 --> 01:00:48.814
Hey, do you even know
how to use that thing?

1253
01:00:48.838 --> 01:00:50.642
Tori: Yeah. You aim is and pull
the fucking trigger.

1254
01:00:50.666 --> 01:00:52.183
Yeah?

1255
01:00:52.217 --> 01:00:53.805
Let's go.

1256
01:01:07.115 --> 01:01:08.598
Cover me.

1257
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:19.357
Okay. I'm clear.

1258
01:01:19.392 --> 01:01:21.081
Tori, get in there!

1259
01:01:21.116 --> 01:01:23.392
Stay away from the fucking car!
He's in there!

1260
01:01:23.426 --> 01:01:25.426
Do you see anything?

1261
01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:33.531
Something's not right.
Something's not right!

1262
01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.807
Yeah, he's not fucking human.
That's what's not right.

1263
01:01:35.841 --> 01:01:37.427
Do you see anything?

1264
01:01:39.324 --> 01:01:42.324
Monroe! Monroe!

1265
01:01:44.393 --> 01:01:46.151
Oh, fuck!

1266
01:01:47.117 --> 01:01:49.220
Where are you, motherfucker?!

1267
01:01:49.255 --> 01:01:51.083
Show yourself!

1268
01:01:51.118 --> 01:01:53.394
Get out of here now!

1269
01:01:53.428 --> 01:01:57.635
Come on, motherfucker!
Let me see your face.

1270
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.083
Hey!

1271
01:02:02.187 --> 01:02:03.704
Come on, fuck you!

1272
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:07.808
Oh, no, wait!

1273
01:02:07.842 --> 01:02:09.359
No! No!

1274
01:02:09.394 --> 01:02:10.360
Aah!

1275
01:02:10.395 --> 01:02:13.498
Oh, fuck!

1276
01:02:38.396 --> 01:02:40.775
Oh, god. Okay.

1277
01:03:04.466 --> 01:03:07.329
Hello? Oh, fuck!

1278
01:03:07.363 --> 01:03:08.708
Fuck.

01:03:25.329 --> 01:03:29.020
Okay, okay, okay.

1280
01:03:29.606 --> 01:03:30.640
Uh...

1281
01:03:31.606 --> 01:03:33.054
Hello?

1282
01:03:33.433 --> 01:03:34.709
Hello?

1283
01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.778
Fuck!

1284
01:03:55.227 --> 01:03:57.572
Hello? Hello, is anyone there?

1285
01:03:57.607 --> 01:03:59.100
Dispatch, I'm at the fuckin'
police station.

1286
01:03:59.124 --> 01:04:00.676
I need your help.

1287
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:02.641
Hello? Someone fuckin' answer

Hello? Hello?
Can anybody hear me?

01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:12.585
Everybody's fucking dead!

Ah! Fuck!
