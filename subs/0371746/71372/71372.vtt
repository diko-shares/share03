1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,479
Trice.

2
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,734
You got to pull it together.

3
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,111
Are you gonna help me, yes or no?

4
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,114
I ain't gonna get you no gun. No. Hell no!

5
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,991
Don't take a righteous tone with me.

6
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,036
How am I supposed to live with this?

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,164
Knowing that he's out there,
living his life,

8
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,291
loving on his child.

9
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,542
What about mine?

10
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,213
Taking this out on the street, Tricey,
that ain't you. It's not you.

11
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:50,675
What do you know what's me
and what's not me?

12
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,927
You don't even have a child!

13
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,766
Until you got a child that's laid out
in front of you, you don't know anything.

14
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,979
I don't know how to help you anymore,
Tricey.

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,274
I don't know.

16
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,942
I'll find another way.

17
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,281
I'll do what I gotta do!

18
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,269
- What are you doing here?
- What did Petey do?

19
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,187
What?

20
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,310
Manny and Osorio were whispering
about some witness,

21
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,858
about turning Petey in.
What the fuck did he do?

22
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

23
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,782
I didn't tell you, but when I moved
my stuff out of Wally's house,

24
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,951
he... he went fucking crazy on me.

25
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,995
And these cops came by my house,
asking about his car.

26
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,914
His blue SUV. Why?

27
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,791
What's going on?

28
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,753
Marie. Look at me!

29
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,382
You're always complaining about him,
and I'm sick of it.

30
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,928
That kid in the park...

31
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,723
it was Pete who killed him?

32
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,226
Don't... Don't use that word in my house.

33
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,481
And don't look at me like that.
You know my husband's a good man.

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,278
How could he do that to a kid?

35
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,072
He was just a kid.

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,657
You always hated him.

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,993
You never leave him alone.

38
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,163
You're just jealous,
'cause you don't have anyone.

39
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,752
There's something wrong with Pete.

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,714
Like in his heart.

41
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,800
When are you gonna see that?

42
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,697
We want justice!

43
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,121
When are we gonna find out
the truth about Brenton Butler?

44
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:26,706
Who killed Brenton?

45
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,917
You, motherfucker? You?

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,556
You rat out another cop,
you're gonna be waiting on a bullet,

47
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
looking over your shoulder
the rest of your days.

48
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,977
- That's a bad fucking play.
- That a threat?

49
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,812
That's common sense.

50
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,816
The witness, the one you said
you took care of? I seen her.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,794
She's in police custody.
Save your fucking breath.

52
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,138
- You seen her, you did nothing?
- Yeah, I don't kill kids.

53
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,239
Neither do I.

54
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,824
Would you fucking look at this shit, man?

55
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,577
It ain't fucking going anywhere.

56
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,747
We had nothing to do with it.
That's on you and Jablonski.

57
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,708
Yeah, you think you know what this shit
looks like moving forward?

58
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,752
Can't even keep your fucking bird
from chirping.

59
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,629
- Fuck you talking about?
- Fucking Teresa.

60
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,589
- You said she was asleep.
- She fucking knows.

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,133
Her cousin Marie called me.

62
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,468
So you listen to me.

63
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,804
Ratting out Jablonski won't do shit.

64
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,223
And once you rat...

65
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,101
all that money you got used to having...

66
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,480
Jasmine got used to spending
on herself and Pearl, that's fucking gone.

67
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,025
See how long your baby mamas
stick around for this shit pay.

68
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,695
- Get yourself a job mowing lawns.
- Ain't no other way, man.

69
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,821
Yeah, there's a way.

70
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,741
Jablonski disappears,
we're all in the clear.

71
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,804
Now you're talking about offing a cop?
You fucking crazy?

72
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,538
Like you did that fucking witness, right?

73
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,125
He's gonna go far, far, away,

74
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,711
out of the city,
out of this fucking state, gone,

75
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,879
and all this shit is gone.

76
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,339
And us...

77
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,302
we go back to what it was.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,179
Just us.

79
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,556
Just like before.

80
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,726
You're liars!
You're all just a bunch of liars!

81
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,980
We get a bigger cut of Messiah's kickback.
Three points to each of us to your two.

82
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,149
No more talking, no negotiating.
That's the deal.

83
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,320
You got 24 hours to get him out of here.
After that, we go to the captain.

84
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,488
Don't hide behind those badges!

85
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,242
No justice, no peace!

86
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,369
No justice, no peace!

87
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,163
What about the fucking witness?

88
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,341
I just want to know why do you do it.

89
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,639
Because it's the best fucking feeling
I've ever had.

90
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,937
You're gonna OD one of these days.

91
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,024
You know that's a possibility, right?

92
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,402
I don't shoot, I smoke.

93
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,656
Cigarettes will kill you faster
than smoking a little junk.

94
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,165
Where are you going?

95
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,876
Stay or go, it's up to you,
but I'm... I'm done.

96
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,628
Look, Fish...

97
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Hey.

98
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,764
How'd it go?

99
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,060
Shit, what?

100
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,687
- What?
- Osorio noshowed.

101
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,314
- Come on.
- Like you.

102
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,025
Where were you?

103
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,153
I called and I texted
and I went to your house.

104
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,531
The kid... The kid, she became demonic.

105
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,783
She smashed my phone, she went nuts.

106
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,952
I couldn't... I couldn't control her.
I had to stay.

107
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,078
Come on.

108
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,831
Where are you going?

109
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,333
We are gonna go and we're gonna find him.

110
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,418
And we're gonna get a confession together.
Come on.

111
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,922
- I'm driving. Slow it down.
- Okay.

112
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,591
If the crowd continues to grow,

113
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,595
we will be administering
deescalation tactics.

114
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:15,017
So, for the next 48 hours,
I'm gonna need all hands on deck.

115
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,272
You'll be getting your rotation schedule
shortly if you haven't already.

116
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,985
Calming the subjects

117
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:28,614
and working towards the safety
of officers and the community.

118
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,908
What the hell happened?

119
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,288
I did a gut check.
It don't feel right. Whatever.

120
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,875
Maybe not now, but look, you had
the right idea. Let's go outside and talk.

121
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,710
Look, I get the feeling you're a good guy,

122
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,421
but in this district,
you're considered a fucking cancer, so...

123
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,298
So you're scared?

124
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,802
Cool. Thanks.
Yeah, that was a good talk.

125
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,305
Yo, that's my man Osorio right there.

126
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,223
Fucking prick.

127
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,783
Yeah, you! Yeah! Dirty cop!

128
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:27,715
Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice!

129
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:35,640
Justice! Justice! Justice! Justice!
Justice! Justice! Justice!

130
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,371
What are you doing here?

131
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,456
Wilcox and Osorio are gonna turn you in.

132
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,336
You got a 24hour window
to get out of the city.

133
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,797
Teresa heard them talking.

134
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,758
He's right, Petey, we gotta go.

135
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,053
You fucking call him before coming to me?

136
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,888
'Cause you don't do anything!

137
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,682
And I feel like an animal,

138
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:20,101
trapped in my own house,
never knowing who's gonna show up.

139
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,144
Enough! Enough.

140
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,984
Where are we supposed to go?

141
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,529
Arizona, Mexico, the fucking moon?

142
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,198
We can't just leave.

143
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,700
But we'll be together, babe.

144
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,245
Just you, me, and Mikey.
That's all that matters.

145
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,671
This is to help make it a little easier.

146
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,929
This ain't enough.

147
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,640
You got no idea how much a baby costs.

148
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:01,410
This isn't gonna last
more than a few months.

149
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,643
Marie, enough.

150
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,145
I'll take care of us.

151
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,524
I'm gonna go pack.

152
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,531
- If I'd just done the right thing...
- This is on me.

153
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,744
Not you. I made the decision.

154
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,787
'Cause in that moment...

155
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,875
all I knew, with certainty,
is that you're a good man.

156
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,880
Above all things, that was clear.

157
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,026
But protecting that is not cut and dry.
It's a fucking minefield.

158
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,470
Lift your fucking head.

159
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,516
Lift your head.

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,186
Hey.

161
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,563
You gotta understand,
for both our sakes...

162
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,733
you are still that guy.

163
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,488
But for now, you gotta take
this opportunity...

164
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,866
and go.

165
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,510
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,382
You should've gotten his confession
last night.

167
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,282
You have no idea what I went through.

168
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,677
- Nadine was there, he might have seen her.
- You fucked up.

169
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,620
That is the bottom line.
And we were close.

170
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,765
- Ongoing investigation, shit happens.
- Fucking bitch!

171
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,623
Hey, hey!

172
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,667
- What the fuck?
- You are nothing to him!

173
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,586
- Nothing! You're just his slut! His whore!
- Hey.

174
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,172
I am his wife! Me! Not you!

175
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,967
- Cool it! Get out of here. Walk away.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

176
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,969
- You are nothing to him!
- Hey.

177
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,221
She fucks my husband
and she's the victim?

178
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,305
Fuck you!

179
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,932
Fuck you both.

180
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,002
Don't just sit there.

181
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,567
Want me to say it's wrong to fuck
other people's spouses? It's wrong.

182
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,301
So fucking what?

183
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,384
Okay.

184
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,387
You think I care?

185
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,432
I'm a bad person.

186
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,102
I fuck other people's husbands,
and I'm a drunk,

187
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,730
and I leave little kids to die.

188
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,691
What?

189
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,235
What are you talking about?

190
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,409
Just...

191
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,455
I could have checked.

192
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,834
I could have called somebody to check.

193
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,378
Check what?
What the fuck are you talking about?

194
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,926
This... This gang kid I put away.

195
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,385
And he never made bail.

196
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:28,057
His baby brother and his sister
were in their apartment alone for a week,

197
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,226
locked in.

198
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,814
And the little one...

199
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,653
the baby, he starved to death.

200
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,784
God, I saw those photos.

201
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,579
There were...

202
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,748
scratch marks...

203
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,335
on the door where Tasha, the girl...

204
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,506
had tried to reach the deadbolt.

205
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,093
And...

206
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,305
bite marks on the spaghetti cans

207
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,267
where she had tried to open them
to save her brother.

208
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,693
Everything I do, I cause damage.

209
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,777
Everything.

210
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,605
Is this the part where I cry
because I understand you better?

211
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,834
'Cause I'm not, and I don't.

212
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:41,130
If being a fuck up helps you justify your
bullshit, don't let me get in your way.

213
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,984
Justice
for Brenton Butler! Stop killing us!

214
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,571
Justice for Brenton Butler!
Stop killing us!

215
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,158
Justice for Brenton Butler!
Stop killing us!

216
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,162
You okay, hon?

217
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,455
I'm fine.

218
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,707
You're Brenton Butler's mother, ain't you?

219
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,459
We want justice!

220
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,963
Justice for Brenton Butler!

221
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,601
God. Go away.

222
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,520
I'm not talking to reporters
or whoever you are.

223
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,899
I lost my son too.

224
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,038
I know what you're going through.

225
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,710
When they killed my Duane,
I checked out too.

226
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,713
Couldn't eat, work, sleep.

227
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,466
I couldn't even pray no more.

228
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,760
Thinking every day,

229
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,680
every moment of every day,

230
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,807
how he must've cried out for me,

231
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,477
how he must've wondered
where his mama was.

232
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,150
I won't lie.

233
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,154
Duane had his runins with the police.

234
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,076
When they encountered him the last time,
he had a gun on him for protection.

235
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,832
They left him to die
out on the street like a dog.

236
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,213
They found Brenton in a ditch.

237
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,552
He was alive and they just...

238
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,512
they just left him.

239
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,598
I don't...

240
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,101
I don't even know what to do anymore.

241
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,442
You gotta forgive.

242
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,696
It was the only way I survived.

243
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,033
By forgiving the man
who took my son from me.

244
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,784
It was the only way.

245
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,497
And then I got to hold up other mothers,
see them through their pain.

246
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,708
- No, no, no, no.
- There's so many of us out there.

247
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,918
You and me, we're not the same.

248
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,004
I need to go,

249
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,674
and I need you to get out of my car,
please.

250
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,551
There's a bereavement group
over on Duncan...

251
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,053
I said please.

252
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,993
He's gotta have her in there.

253
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,101
Please!

254
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,772
Darling, I've missed you so.

255
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,068
Meko!

256
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,447
Fuck!

257
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,531
Who?

258
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,871
I need a favor, Allie. Please.

259
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,459
What did you do now?

260
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,049
You're gonna stay here now.

261
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,300
What? Why?

262
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,428
If they find you, they'll kill you.
That's why they followed me to the motel.

263
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,808
But we're like on Long Island.

264
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,685
I offered to take you home.

265
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,186
My parents won't let me testify.

266
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,231
And so we're here,
150 miles out of harm's way.

267
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,151
Now this is what's gonna happen.
No drinking, no drugs, no internet,

268
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,735
no cell phone, no bullshit.

269
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,654
The lady who lives here is a cop.

270
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,866
She knows a con when she sees one.

271
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,010
So unless you want to end up
at child protective services,

272
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,119
you're gonna listen to her.

273
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,038
At night, not gonna leave your room
for any reason, not to take a piss.

274
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,582
During the day, when she's at work,

275
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,935
you're gonna spend your time
volunteering at a local kennel.

276
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,043
What the fuck?

277
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,338
I'll show you how to get to the kennel,
how to get home. But you run on me...

278
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,299
you're on your own.

279
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,388
And now let me introduce you
to my exwife. Come on.

280
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,559
Let's go, come on.

281
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,115
Listen. Listen, I want that gun. Seth.
You're gonna get that for me, right?

282
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,492
Fuck, man! I told you
I ain't helping you with that shit!

283
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,786
I'm not gonna be like her,
talking about forgiveness!

284
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,872
I'm not gonna betray my son
with that nonsense.

285
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,956
You're gonna help me.

286
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,208
What the...?

287
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,420
Listen, when he looked at me,
all he saw was just another welfare queen

288
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,839
who surrendered her child to the streets.

289
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,717
He couldn't care less about what he did!

290
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,097
Latrice, once you cross that line,
you're forever on the other side of it.

291
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,434
Well, then you know where to find me.

292
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,028
I like dogs, but damn, he fucking reeks.

293
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:42,032
Hey, don't say that. She can totally
hear you, and she's gorgeous.

294
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,159
Aren't you, Whiskey? Yes, you are.

295
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,120
- You didn't go off premises, did you?
- No.

296
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,337
- Can I come back tomorrow?
- Yeah, but we gotta go, the ex is waiting.

297
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,378
She loses her mind if you're a minute late
to her fucking driedout pot roast.

298
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,714
Why is she your ex?

299
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,152
- Cause' she is. Come on.
- Does your daughter want a dog?

300
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,856
We're not taking Whiskey with us.
Let's go.

301
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,608
No, listen. She's a good dog, okay?
She's a great dog. She's like...

302
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,225
She's one of those dogs
that'll fight for you harder than anyone

303
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,018
and lose their life to save yours,

304
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:16,066
'cause she knows what it's like
to be sad and scared and alone.

305
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:19,903
And she'll never give up on you,
even if everyone else does.

306
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,782
I can just tell. Can't you?

307
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,287
I'll think about it, okay?

308
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,079
Okay.

309
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,542
- Let's go. Put her in the hole. Come on.
- Fine, fine.

310
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,088
Come on, Whiskey.
Bad man won't let us take you with us.

311
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,270
I'd have had more respect for 'em
if they put a bullet in his head,

312
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,926
but they just left him there.

313
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,679
He didn't have no shoes on.

314
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,683
They just left him there
waiting to die in his socks.

315
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,562
That's my blood they spilt.

316
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,816
And I know who the motherfucker is
that did him.

317
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,775
FiveO.

318
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,906
So I'd like to get what I came for
and be on my way.

319
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,076
Killing a cop? Hell no.

320
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,287
Be a moratorium on business.

321
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,789
Then killing a nigga's okay for business?

322
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,207
I didn't make the rules.

323
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,794
Nah, you just abide by them.

324
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:23,508
My nigga, if you see a weak man
sitting here in this chair,

325
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,093
your eyes are deceiving you.

326
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,182
You ain't no body snatcher.

327
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,684
Unless war changed you.

328
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,646
You got that PTSD?

329
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,442
What, you gonna go all John Rambo
and kill the motherfucker

330
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,694
and disappear into the woods
or some shit?

331
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,081
Why you still standing here?

332
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,125
'Cause I can.

333
00:22:58,835 --> 00:22:59,961
Unlike you.

334
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,965
Unlike my nephew that laid in that ditch.

335
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,259
And the nigga that crippled you,

336
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,553
what became of him?

337
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,225
That's the game.

338
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,728
That's how it's played.

339
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,863
Go hit up them corners
before I take that away from you too.

340
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,348
Is it true they left him to die out here?

341
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,855
He didn't die right away.

342
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,984
He was a strong kid.

343
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,154
And he hung on for a while.

344
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,201
I think sometimes the dying do that.

345
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,913
Give us a chance to say goodbye.

346
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,921
You know something.

347
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,382
Teresa...

348
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:16,181
I know what it's like to want absolution

349
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,101
and to need to be forgiven
for the things we've done.

350
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,356
Please talk to me.

351
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,026
I was driving my cousin to the hospital.

352
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,363
- I told you.
- You're not telling me everything.

353
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,742
I had to 'cause her husband was at work.

354
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,329
He showed up later.

355
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,872
And then...

356
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,254
then I went to work,
after her husband came.

357
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,298
Teresa, please.

358
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,134
I told you already!
You're not listening to me!

359
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:09,067
Better not be YouTube cat videos.
I hate cats.

360
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,779
Security cam footage from Bayonne hospital

361
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,489
the morning of the hitandrun.

362
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:20,203
So... there's Teresa
and her pregnant cousin,

363
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:25,250
arriving in the parking lot at 6:45 a.m.,
just like she told us.

364
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,420
Another camera caught her
inside the hospital.

365
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,215
Teresa leaves 45 minutes later
at 7:30 a.m.

366
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,384
So maybe from there
she plowed down the kid.

367
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,511
Brenton had to have been hit earlier

368
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,973
because of the degree of frostbite
on his body, and Teresa's car is silver.

369
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,256
So why are we looking at this?

370
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:44,352
Well, what if the cousin
is the one who hit Brenton?

371
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,607
- What's her name?
- That's what we have to find out.

372
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:52,902
We need to pull hospital records
and find out what she drives

373
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,197
and look into Teresa's alibi
after she left the hospital.

374
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,907
She said she went to work.

375
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,452
I'm on it, boss.

376
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,164
I'm just asking, what are you gonna
be doing besides ordering me around?

377
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,127
Get to work. Find the cousin.

378
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,714
Hey, listen, if, um...

379
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:18,636
If you ever need to talk
about that thing...

380
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,433
I know how I reacted.

381
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,396
It's just, kids starving, that's um...

382
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Thanks.

383
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,577
I've been getting some complaints
from my folks

384
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,039
about your officers being
a little too aggressive on the streets.

385
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,435
You need to honor the same protections
I extend to your people.

386
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,919
What the fuck you talking about?

387
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:55,215
I put the brakes on a dirtnap
a disgruntled employee had in the works

388
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,758
for your man Jablonski.

389
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,636
It seems to me
like you did yourself the favor.

390
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,055
Nobody touches police.

391
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,723
Regardless,

392
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,769
as a businessman, it'd be foolish of me
not to seize this opportunity.

393
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,605
I say we let nature take its course.

394
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:13,066
Let your man Jablonski
get what's coming to him.

395
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,527
Clear the books of all this shit.

396
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,032
Jersey City don't become fucking Ferguson
and we get back to business.

397
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,204
Let's get something straight here,

398
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,623
'cause you got
this whole arrangement confused.

399
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,793
Nobody touches police. Do you hear me?

400
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:37,382
If it's blue, you and your fucking kind,

401
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:41,428
you clear the whole fucking sidewalk
the moment you think you see us coming.

402
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,846
We run the shit here!

403
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,390
You just lease out space.

404
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,185
If Jablonski so much
as catches a fucking cold,

405
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,187
I am coming back here,

406
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,232
I'm gonna make sure you join
those other loudmouthed niggas

407
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,569
at the bottom of the Hudson River
who thought they had something to say.

408
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,863
I hope we understand each other.

409
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,493
Get the fuck out of my way.

410
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,458
- Hey, what you need?
- Need to holler at Kadeuce.

411
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,060
- Yo, Kadeuce!
- Tell 'em to back away.

412
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,669
You remember this day?

413
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,245
Now, I made my peace with God,

414
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,175
so whatever happens out on this corner
doesn't matter to me.

415
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,261
I need you to tell me
what you know about my boy.

416
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:27,432
You didn't want to know about him when
he was here, so I ain't got shit for you.

417
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,684
So whatever you're gonna do,
go ahead and do it.

418
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,436
Otherwise get the fuck off my corner.

419
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,145
No!

420
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,190
This ain't about business.

421
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,901
We don't need that shit out here.

422
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,361
Go feed the streets. Get this money.

423
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,744
If I didn't take time to know him then,
I'll do whatever it takes to know him now.

424
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,427
I wanted to protect him.
I didn't want him to be like everybody...

425
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,455
Like what?

426
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,999
Like me?

427
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,710
I guess nothing about me
has really changed?

428
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,963
Still hand to mouth. Bullshit and roaches
everywhere I lay my head.

429
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,677
I guess I'm everything you thought I'd be,
Mr. Butler.

430
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:10,892
But the person you saw back then was
your savior tonight. Don't get it twisted.

431
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,436
Your God ain't got shit to do with this.

432
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,772
You can thank Brenton for that.

433
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,735
If you live long enough
to get out of this life,

434
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,985
you'll realize it was God
that touched your heart and used you.

435
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,362
Used me?

436
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,758
Wouldn't make him no different
than any other man in my life.

437
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,908
I never used you.

438
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,659
No.

439
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,497
That would've meant
you actually saw some value in me.

440
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,796
Brenton wasn't built for this.

441
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,968
It was like trying to prevent a lamb
from becoming a lion.

442
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,972
No need, it ain't in his nature.

443
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,016
Is that what he saw in you, a lion?

444
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,687
Then what?

445
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,463
You want a beer?

446
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,636
- Yes or no? A simple question.
- What the fuck you still doing here?

447
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,597
I ain't gonna run.

448
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,601
So you're gonna spend
the rest of your life behind bars?

449
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,354
You are making
the biggest fucking mistake of your life.

450
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,523
No, I did that when I listened to you.

451
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,536
Take your money.

452
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,751
I'm gonna be a father.

453
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,839
You know, I had shit for an example,
but that don't mean I gotta repeat it.

454
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,675
I'm not him.

455
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,346
I ain't a coward. I ain't running.

456
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,431
When everything...

457
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,894
Everything's gonna be like it was before.

458
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,210
Nothing is ever gonna be
like it was before.

459
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,104
Fuck! Fuck! Motherfuck!

460
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,837
Messiah, it's me.

461
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,842
Jablonski...

462
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,095
let it happen.

463
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,288
Why are we here?

464
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,914
Seth.

465
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,208
Seth.

466
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,961
Want to know what it's like
to take a life?

467
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,131
Shoot the dog.

468
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,216
No.

469
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,886
You're gonna tell me
you can't shoot no dog

470
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,305
but you're gonna step up on a man
and kill him?

471
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,723
Shoot it.

472
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
Two hands, arms strong.

473
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,107
Get up close, ensure the kill,
not just injure it.

474
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,859
You gotta put the gun to its head.

475
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,611
- Shoot it.
- Shut up.

476
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,528
Do it now.

477
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,572
If you're gonna kill it, just kill it.

478
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:37,408
You see what it's like up close?
Think this is easy? Do it.

479
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,910
Do it now, Tricey!

480
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,620
Do it now!

481
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,421
No!

482
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,105
Go on. Get.

483
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,794
Then what the fuck am I paying you for?
If he's short, that's a problem.

484
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,712
Look, if you can't hand...

485
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,005
Hold up.

486
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,721
Look, let me call you back.

487
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,645
Boric acid, for the roaches.

488
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,398
The stuff works, but it's best I show you.

489
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,233
How you find me?

490
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,044
You got some customers
that needed ten dollars

491
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,308
more than they wanted
to keep your address to themselves.

492
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,576
I didn't see your value, but my son did.

493
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
That means something to me.

494
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,836
You want to spread a dusting.

495
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,548
Most fools make the mistake
of leaving a line.

496
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,676
Nah, roaches walk around that.

497
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,095
You want them to walk through it.

498
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,597
Get it on them.

499
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,933
Then when they lick themselves clean,
they ingest it.

500
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,560
It poisons their stomach.

501
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,438
You know a lot about roaches?

502
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,773
Unfortunately.

503
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,110
You keep your place clean though.

504
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,698
I thought I was gonna have to point out
their attraction to crumbs.

505
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,911
Yeah, I like my shit tight.

506
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,246
Yeah.

507
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,875
Brenton wasn't like that
in the same regard.

508
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,046
If this is tight, he kept his room loose.

509
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,216
Real loose.

510
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,011
Yeah. It ain't much, but it works for now.

511
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,514
And what about tomorrow?

512
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,807
I got plans.

513
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,478
I wrote down this Thomas Edison quote.

514
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,772
He's the light bulb dude.

515
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:14,690
Something like...

516
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,402
"Vision without executing it
is just a hallucination."

517
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,157
You know, you got to put your plan
into action.

518
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,493
I mean, this shit here is temporary.

519
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,038
By the time I'm your age,
I'll probably have like two houses

520
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,582
and my own ranch or something.

521
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,835
All right. You want to give it a shot?

522
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,337
I'll supervise.

523
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,924
- Mess up my stomach?
- Not unless you plan to eat it.

524
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,094
Yeah, maybe show me again.

525
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,929
Yeah, you're a businessman.

526
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,814
You gonna show me or what?

527
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,358
Yeah, I'll show you.

528
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,036
The room's paid for, so you ain't got
to sleep in that funkyass car no more.

529
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,293
Gotta yourself some quiet here.

530
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,796
Find some peace.

531
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,968
Let Isaiah know where you're at.

532
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,565
I took the clip out.

533
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:42,737
So you ain't gotta be bothering yourself
with no more ideas about that gun.

534
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:50,328
I plead with Brenton every night
in my dreams.

535
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,377
I say to him,
"Baby, what were you doing out there?"

536
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,675
And then he says,
"Mom, I was waiting for you."

537
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,928
But you never came.

538
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,807
"You never came."

539
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:17,271
Tricey, you ain't no killer,
so this ain't something to lament.

540
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,693
Then I got nothing left.

541
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,905
Nothing.

542
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,952
You say I ought to find peace.

543
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,580
Where?

544
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,958
Where am I gonna find that now?

545
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,815
- No justice!
- No peace!

546
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,650
- No justice!
- No peace!

547
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,193
- No justice!
- No peace!

548
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,031
Excuse me.

549
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,329
- Get them the fuck out of here.
- Go ahead.

550
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,668
Crazy fucking shit?

551
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,881
Captain called in every cop
in the district. It's going down.

552
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,967
He's gone. It's over.

553
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,053
Where'd he go?

554
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,140
I did what I said I'd fucking do.
It's over.

555
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,026
Teresa's alibi from after the hospital
checks out.

556
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,487
She was at the hair salon
in Bayonne by 8:00 a.m.

557
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,989
Some octogenarian who needed a perm.

558
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,159
Her boss says that her day
was packed with hair shit until five.

559
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,151
And who's her pregnant cousin?

560
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,603
Hospital won't release the records.

561
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,915
Confidentiality bullshit.

562
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,501
I'll serve them
with a grand jury subpoena.

563
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,461
Probably won't have anything
until the morning.

564
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,422
If Teresa had social media accounts,
she deleted them. Hey. Do you mind?

565
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,762
A riot's breaking out,
this dipshit's playing with a toy.

566
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,767
Get the fuck off my desk. Get ready!
Don't you see what's going on?

567
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,393
- Are you kidding me?
- You kidding me?

568
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,205
- Back off.
- Go fuck yourself! You're an asshole!

569
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,273
Am I the only one that thinks it's weird
that Wilcox has a toy?

570
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,569
Toys are appropriate for children,
and he's a child, so...

571
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,239
But why does he have that thing?

572
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:17,451
Why? You want to borrow it?
You're bad as the rest of them.

573
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,330
There was cake from a baby shower thing
when I first got here.

574
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:26,460
And Osorio said that one of the guys
on his team just had a... had a baby,

575
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,212
and that's why the cake.

576
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,175
Okay. Wait, so...

577
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,678
Wilcox with this toy.

578
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,224
Wilcox doesn't have a kid.
DiAngelo doesn't have a kid.

579
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,810
Osorio...

580
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,272
He's got a fouryearold daughter.

581
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,567
But he said that someone on the team
had just had a baby.

582
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,989
Teresa said that her pregnant cousin's
husband was working that morning

583
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,324
and that's why he couldn't take her
to the hospital.

584
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,162
And she kept making a point of it,
like she kept talking about the husband.

585
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:07,167
Pull up the parking lot footage. Now.

586
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,547
No, she said he came later.
You have to fastforward past this.

587
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,630
Okay.

588
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,634
Stop.

589
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,849
Blue SUV.

590
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,560
- Get it with the lobby.
- Yeah.

591
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,110
Back it up. Stop.

592
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,278
That's him.

593
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,657
That's our boy.

594
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,578
- Where's the printer?
- Already on it.

595
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,545
Stay here. See if you can match the photo
and get a name.

596
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,130
I'll take a copy to Latrice.

597
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,884
- How'd you know...
- Your husband told me you were here.

598
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,147
We need to talk.

599
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,065
Please.

600
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,154
Um...

601
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,325
Is this the man you saw
in your son's room?

602
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,244
I don't know.

603
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,165
You know. But you won't tell me,
and there's a difference.

604
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:31,835
Look at him and tell me
this isn't the man who killed your son.

605
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:36,590
Don't you want him to pay?
For what he did to you, your family?

606
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,716
Your son?

607
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,135
He will.

608
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:41,970
What did you say?

609
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,431
- You gotta go. Get out of my room.
- What did you do?

610
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,433
- Tell me what you did to him.
- Who cares?

611
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,102
Who cares?

612
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,271
Nobody cared about what happened
to my son!

613
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,318
He was just another black boy that was
laying out there just waiting to die.

614
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,446
No one cared. No one came for him. No one!

615
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,698
He's gonna get what he deserves.

616
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,326
He's gonna pay, believe me.

617
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,744
And he will.

618
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,955
But not this way.

619
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,458
If you want him to pay,
and I mean really pay,

620
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,294
he needs to look you in your eyes
and say it.

621
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,338
Say what he did.

622
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,258
Because if he doesn't, the others...

623
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,886
And there were others
at that ditch that morning...

624
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,763
they'll go free.

625
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,810
And they will never pay
for what they did to your son, to you.

626
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,813
So, please, Mrs. Butler,

627
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,650
is this the man you saw
in your son's hospital room?

628
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,408
His name is Peter Jablonski.

629
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,669
What is it, Mrs. Butler?

630
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,339
Who are you here to see?

631
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,260
Officer Peter Jablonski.

632
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,761
He know what this is about?

633
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,224
Yeah. He does.

634
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,351
Have a seat.

635
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,616
My brother was 12 years old!

636
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,911
Twelve years old
and they shot him down dead!

637
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,370
And the man who killed him,

638
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,707
the cop who put a gun
to my baby brother's head

639
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,169
and took his life is free today!

640
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,504
Justice!

641
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,255
Now!

642
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,465
Justice!

643
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,261
Rinaldi.

644
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:51,767
His name is Peter Jablonski.

645
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,852
I have unis en route to his house.

646
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:58,315
The uncle, Seth Butler, is unaccounted for
and he has a gun.

647
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,650
He's looking for him.

648
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,904
Fish, please, let's avoid
any more heartache for this family.

649
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,470
Hey, anyone seen an Officer Jablonski
around? He's got a visitor.

650
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,932
II got it.

651
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,778
I don't think I ever thanked you
for your service, did I?

652
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,034
Air Force, yeah? What do they call
you guys? Like Zoomies?

653
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:02,546
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen, listen, listen.

654
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,009
We got him.

655
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,307
So, if you got a clear head,
you're gonna surrender that weapon.

656
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,352
I ain't surrendering shit.

657
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,063
- What do we want?
- Justice!

658
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,607
- When do we want it?
- Now!

659
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,317
- What do we want?
- Justice!

660
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,776
- When do we want it?
- Now!

661
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,425
All right.
Well, here's what's gonna happen.

662
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,251
You're gonna get yourself killed.

663
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,839
You know what's some shit?

664
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:51,094
If I die overseas, I'm a hero.

665
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,891
But if I catch a bullet in my own streets,
I'm a thug.

666
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,602
And ain't neither one of those the truth.

667
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,485
You called my nephew a thug.

668
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,403
You and all the rest.

669
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,115
It's true. I did.

670
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,700
How's it feel?

671
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,204
Being the one
on the working end of a Glock?

672
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,125
Being a prisoner on your own streets?

673
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,129
Do you hear them out there?

674
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,091
These ain't our streets.

675
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,302
This ain't my country.

676
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,140
I was a fool to ever believe it was.

677
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,311
I came here to do one thing.

678
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,231
And that's to meet the man
who killed my nephew.

679
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,441
Deliver him a message.

680
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,487
Cops lives matter!
Cops lives matter! Cops lives matter!

681
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,239
- What do we want?
- Justice!

682
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,907
- When do we want it?
- Now!

683
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,409
- What do we want?
- Justice!

684
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:56,993
- When do we want it?
- Now!

685
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,128
You are
in violation of a peaceful assembly.

686
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,005
You must disperse immediately.

687
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,509
You know that's not gonna happen.

688
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,637
'Cause he's not here.

689
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,181
Give me the gun.

690
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,145
He needs to look at what he did.

691
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,025
- He needs to know what he did.
- No, you don't want to do that.

692
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,318
I want him to see...

693
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,987
- I want him to see...
- Just don't.

694
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,117
Who Brenton was.

695
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,121
Not a thug.

696
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,372
Not a punk.

697
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,960
Not just some black kid on the street.
Just... Just a kid.

698
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:52,007
They got his mug shot
on every TV and paper,

699
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,843
and they think they know who he is,
but they don't.

700
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,811
This... is who Brenton Butler was.

701
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,107
May I?

702
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,876
Hey, hey, hey. Listen. Go home, okay?

703
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,009
You are in violation
of a peaceful assembly.

704
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,928
- We want justice!
- That's right!

705
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:38,887
We're staying!

706
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,431
We want justice!

707
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,317
Yeah!

708
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,113
This is for Brenton! This is for Brenton!

709
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,912
Hey, Wilcox! Stop!

710
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,540
No, chill! Manny! Manny, come on, man!

711
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,625
There!

712
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,377
Run!

713
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,664
Fish, we missed him.

714
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,415
He's gone.

715
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,003
His wife tipped him off
when unis got here.

716
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,508
I called Connelly. He is notifying Medina.

717
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,676
Arrest the others.

718
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,442
- Thanks.
- Good job.

719
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,532
Medina wants a word with both of you.

720
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,660
Yeah, Sarge. You know what about?

721
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,579
Come with me.

722
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,476
Pete Jablonski.

723
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,646
He was driving the blue Ford
that hit the kid.

724
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,899
But that's not what killed him.

725
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:03,281
What killed Brenton Butler
is called depraved indifference.

726
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,798
Stand up and turn around.

727
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,323
It's your career.

728
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,833
Please tell me
you at least fucked her by now.

729
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,713
I'm guessing that's a no.

730
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,468
Let's go.

731
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,161
You shouldn't be here.

732
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,830
Seth?

733
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,708
He was at the district, but he is fine.

734
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,876
He wasn't arrested.

735
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,839
And him?

736
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,175
We got the other three.

737
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,177
He can't have gone far.

738
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,180
We put out a BOLO and we will find him.

739
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,600
But in the meantime, you should go home.

740
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,358
I'll call you as soon as I hear anything,
okay?

741
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,242
- I just want to say goodbye to my son.
- Go, go.

742
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,369
Petey!

743
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,373
Put your hands against the car,
sir, right now.

744
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,257
I can't allow that.

745
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,225
You're under arrest, Officer Jablonski.

746
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,927
- Here we go.
- All right.

747
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,850
Okay. Watch your head.
