00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:06.707
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

2
00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:08.575
Please, no gang signs.

3
00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.143
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

4
00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:13.146
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

5
00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:14.581
It's looking good.

6
00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:22.222
Contact left!

7
00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:25.092
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

8
00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.775
Get back!

9
00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.811
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

10
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.213
Stay down!

11
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.355
Stay in the...

12
00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.091
Son of a bitch!

13
00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.965
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

14
00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.694
...damn it!

15
00:01:36.163 --> 00:01:39.700
- Rhodey! Rhodey!
- Get down, Tony!

16
00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.570
- Rhodey!
- Get down!

17
00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.311
Work it!

18
00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.316
All right. Hey!

19
00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:38.652
So do you really have
the Rain Man Suite?

20
00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:40.521
- Don't discuss...
- Excuse me. Can I get in here, please?

21
00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.890
Hey! God, I can't believe it.
They roped you into this?

22
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.458
Yeah, they said you'd be
deeply honoured

23
00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:45.692
if I presented you with an award.

24
00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.195
Yeah, yeah, okay. Hey, just a couple
more and then we'll get going.

25
00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:49.596
- So, here you go.
- Oh, jeez.

26
00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:51.431
- To Tony Stark, an Apogee Award.
- I ran a little late

27
00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.033
'cause they don't have clocks
up in here.

28
00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.601
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah. It's okay.

29
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.137
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

30
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.472
I don't have any of those
floating around.

31
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.140
We're gonna let it ride!

32
00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:03.944
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

33
00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.179
Okay, you, too.

34
00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.114
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

35
00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:09.349
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

36
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.018
Two craps. Two craps.

37
00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.020
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

38
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.488
I think we're gonna be fine.
Colour me up, William.

39
00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:18.659
Okay. We're gonna double up.
Right here.

40
00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.793
Red or black?

41
00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.395
You got a horse in this race.
What do you think?

42
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.230
- No, sir.
- All right, it's on you, Rhodey. Red?

43
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.899
- No. It's not my...
- Black? Red?

44
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.169
It's $3 million, man. I can't do that.

45
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:30.370
- Black.
- Red.

46
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.872
No offence, but you weren't exactly...

47
00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:33.473
Sir, that bet exceeds the table limit.

48
00:04:33.574 --> 00:04:36.276
Tommy, is this still Caesars Palace?

49
00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:38.679
Then we're good.

50
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:42.115
- It's a bet.
- That's $3 million right there.

51
00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.317
Yeah.

52
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.255
You ready for tomorrow?

53
00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.591
It's a hot zone man.
I don't think we should be going...

54
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:54.595
No, I want a demo in a live theatre.
It adds immediacy, and...

55
00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:55.996
Eleven, black.

56
00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.465
Tommy, can we comp the room?
Maybe some eggs?

57
00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:01.835
- Let's hit the slots.
- No slots. Come on. Tony!

58
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.772
What's better, winning all that money
or not caring about it?

59
00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:09.076
Nothing's real with you.
You got the world. I'm out.

60
00:05:09.176 --> 00:05:10.744
- All right.
- Tomorrow, don't be late.

61
00:05:10.844 --> 00:05:11.912
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

62
00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.413
I know, I know.

63
00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.550
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

64
00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:25.492
- Good morning, Mr. Stark. Hot towel?
- Yes, please.

65
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.995
- Hey, let's heat up the sake, huh?
- No.

66
00:05:28.095 --> 00:05:30.030
Get a little aperitivo going.
We got a sushi theme.

67
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.798
We're not drinking. We are working.

68
00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.001
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

69
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:36.003
incapable of being responsible.

70
00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:38.472
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- Hi.

71
00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:39.873
It is 11:00 in the morning...

72
00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:42.776
I know, but it's 11:00 at night
where we're going. Follow me.

73
00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:44.811
It is the right thing to do.

74
00:05:44.912 --> 00:05:47.447
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

75
00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.615
Hot sake?

76
00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.718
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

77
00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:54.321
You know, when I'm putting on
this muniform in the morning,

78
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.656
you know what thought
comes to my mind, Daddy?

79
00:05:55.756 --> 00:05:57.991
- The "muniform"?
- Is the fact that

80
00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.894
everybody in the world
that has this uniform on

81
00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:02.429
- has my back.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.631
- You know what that feels like?
- Having your back.

83
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:08.268
And what's even better is the fact
that I got their back.

84
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.571
- It's like...
- That's a good feeling.

85
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.040
It's absolutely like Popeye used to say...

86
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.908
- What did he say?
- "You are what you were, man."

87
00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:16.076
"I am what I am."

88
00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:17.477
- Whatever.
- Well, get it right,

89
00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:18.979
if you're gonna quote Popeye,
then say the right thing.

90
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.080
But Popeye could have been

91
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.648
- more than what he is.
- Yeah, yeah. Look...

92
00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:24.918
That's you, man. You can be more
than what you are right now.

93
00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:28.789
Yeah. I'm a little distracted.
Are you missing the whole thing?

94
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.492
We got bogeys
at 10:00, 11:00 and 2:00, here.

95
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:34.862
- Give them the time of the day, will you?
- Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry.

96
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:39.199
Yeah. There's been a change over here.
We're kind of... We're loosening up.

97
00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:40.501
- Where's my manners?
- Oh, Trixie.

98
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:42.336
Hello, Mr. Stark.

99
00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:45.239
- Turndown service?
- Would you mind?

100
00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.940
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

101
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.009
Trixie has my back.

102
00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:50.611
- I see that.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:54.481
- We're gonna go rest up.
- That's a nice colour on you.

104
00:06:55.816 --> 00:06:58.218
You like me in blue? Okay.

105
00:06:58.318 --> 00:07:00.988
- Hey! Hey! Get some rest.
- Sure.

106
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.090
We've got a briefing in the morning.

107
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.793
And don't you ever forget,
you are a good man, Tony Stark.

108
00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.530
That's a good man right there.

109
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.399
- Hello, Colonel Rhodes.
- Hi.

110
00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.436
- How's the service been?
- The service is wonderful.

111
00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:21.074
You wanna... Ever seen a B-1 bomber?

112
00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:22.676
- Colonel Rhodes...
- Tell us about it.

113
00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.478
...what kind of planes do you fly?

114
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.460
All right. That's it.
I'm gonna have to get me some rest.

115
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.329
We're about to make
our final approach, gentlemen.

116
00:07:42.429 --> 00:07:44.298
Please take your seats.

117
00:08:01.081 --> 00:08:02.115
General.

118
00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:05.853
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

119
00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:07.120
Thanks.

120
00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:11.158
How was your flight?

121
00:08:11.225 --> 00:08:12.559
It was great.

122
00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.965
Smooth flight, huh?

123
00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:19.766
Choppy up there, but all right.

124
00:09:39.746 --> 00:09:41.348
Area attention!

125
00:09:41.849 --> 00:09:44.184
As you were. Colonel, word.

126
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.253
Yes, sir.

127
00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:50.390
So you're really going through with this?

128
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:52.526
I'm going back there, sir.

129
00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:57.531
It's been three months without a single
indication that Stark is even alive.

130
00:09:57.631 --> 00:10:00.901
We can't keep risking assets.
Least of all you.

131
00:10:01.001 --> 00:10:03.604
What? Are you blocking
my transfer now?

132
00:10:05.172 --> 00:10:08.609
You know, any one of these guys will
walk through fire to have your career.

133
00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.644
Are you telling me
you're willing to sacrifice that

134
00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.513
in order to fly around
with a bunch of snake-eaters

135
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.816
in the off-chance you're gonna find
your friend in the middle of a desert?

136
00:10:15.883 --> 00:10:17.184
I am, sir.

137
00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:20.921
Then I only have one thing
to say to you, Colonel.

138
00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:22.890
Godspeed.

139
00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.527
Thank you, sir.

140
00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:36.036
Welcome home, sir.

141
00:10:36.136 --> 00:10:38.172
Thank you kindly, Jarvis.

142
00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:40.541
It's been a long time.

143
00:10:43.377 --> 00:10:48.415
Based on news reports,
I calculated your safe return at 0.25%.

144
00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:50.751
Yeah. I missed you, too.

145
00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:27.888
You have 1,713 new voice messages.

146
00:11:28.889 --> 00:11:31.225
How shall I categorise for you?

147
00:11:42.603 --> 00:11:43.971
Delete all.

148
00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:55.215
I'm detecting the presence of
electromagnetic energy in the house.

149
00:11:57.417 --> 00:11:58.986
Boot up the scanner, will you?

150
00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:19.540
Shall we start machining the parts?

151
00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:28.615
Not bad for a bunch of ones and zeros.

152
00:13:08.589 --> 00:13:11.258
Careful. The door is sticking a little.

153
00:13:14.728 --> 00:13:17.164
- What happened here?
- Broke a glass.

154
00:13:18.098 --> 00:13:21.568
- What's the emergency?
- I would like to throw a party.

155
00:13:22.603 --> 00:13:24.805
So could you get the house
in Dubai ready, please?

156
00:13:24.905 --> 00:13:26.240
- Now?
- Yep.

157
00:13:28.108 --> 00:13:29.610
- Sure.
- Thanks.

158
00:13:44.424 --> 00:13:45.626
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

159
00:13:45.726 --> 00:13:48.028
- Tony, how are you?
- Good. Good.

160
00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:50.464
- Good seeing you.
- Hi, Tony.

161
00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.833
- Come see me.
- Good stuff.

162
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.203
- Nice to see you.
- I'm all yours, Tony.

163
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.106
- Can I borrow this?
- There.

164
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.643
- Tony, how you doing? Good to see you.
- Good stuff.

165
00:14:02.743 --> 00:14:06.446
- Tony! I need the guest house.
- Hey, Giorgio.

166
00:14:06.547 --> 00:14:08.448
Done deal. Okay.

167
00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:11.285
You know him?

168
00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.073
Tony Stark.

169
00:14:33.907 --> 00:14:36.944
- Tony, do you remember me?
- Yeah.

170
00:14:37.044 --> 00:14:39.479
She's Petra... Petra...

171
00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:42.082
- Tony Starks, how are you?
- Hey.

172
00:14:42.182 --> 00:14:44.151
- Nice to see you.
- I'm sorry. I still got your plane.

173
00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:45.886
No, no, no. And I got your Bentley.

174
00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:48.655
So just bring it back full of gas
and everything is...

175
00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:50.524
- Hi. Are they...
- That's for you.

176
00:14:50.624 --> 00:14:52.226
- For my consideration?
- This is for you. This is for you.

177
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:56.129
Good evening. I'm thinking of
a number between one and five.

178
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.531
- Three.
- Three.

179
00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:59.733
Exactly. Shall we?

180
00:15:01.235 --> 00:15:02.769
Boy, oh, boy.

181
00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:06.773
Hey, Potts,
cue the fireworks in five, okay?

182
00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.043
- Honestly, I'm not...
- You make me laugh.

183
00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.746
...entirely comfortable with this
and I never have been.

184
00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:14.648
You know how easy it is
to get a reputation

185
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.283
- and how hard it is to lose?
- Oh, please.

186
00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:18.852
And I'm not playing victim.
I'm not, you know, complaining.

187
00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:21.889
It's just, it's something
that has occurred over time and...

188
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:23.490
Oh, you poor thing.

189
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.726
- And I bear the brunt of it.
- What are we gonna do about that?

190
00:15:25.826 --> 00:15:28.662
Say would you mind joining us briefly?

191
00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.501
You know, people have
limiting beliefs and they...

192
00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:36.870
And I'm just a guy who likes
to invent things. Thank you, by the way.

193
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.839
Though there is an implied perfection,

194
00:15:40.974 --> 00:15:43.343
in everything included
in mavericks, I mean.

195
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.550
But as luck would have it,

196
00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.285
nothing's perfect.

197
00:15:52.753 --> 00:15:54.955
They forgot the glasses.

198
00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:58.892
I'll be right back.

199
00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:02.029
Why don't you guys
get started without me?

200
00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:03.263
Kinky.

201
00:17:05.092 --> 00:17:06.293
Hey.

202
00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:14.535
Get me out of here.

203
00:17:34.454 --> 00:17:36.123
How ironic, Tony!

204
00:17:42.763 --> 00:17:45.532
Trying to rid the world of weapons,

205
00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:48.602
and here you are
giving it one of its best.

206
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:52.272
And now I'm gonna kill you with it!

207
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:23.937
You got to show off, huh?

208
00:18:24.037 --> 00:18:25.672
- Did you flip it?
- No, I didn't flip it.

209
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.509
Why did you have to rip the roof?
Why didn't you just open up the door?

210
00:18:28.609 --> 00:18:31.411
You got a problem?
I'm running out of cars.

211
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:39.353
You could have said "thank you".

212
00:18:41.688 --> 00:18:43.857
We're gonna have
to re-double our efforts.

213
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:47.194
I appreciate the progress
that you've made,

214
00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:49.863
but we're gonna have to dig deeper.
The stakes couldn't be higher.

215
00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.699
Sir, we're still having difficulty
with the propulsion system.

216
00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:55.002
Now, if I could collaborate
with the toroidal fusion group...

217
00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:58.305
This is a data masked project.
Nothing leaves this room.

218
00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:00.274
I understand that, sir.

219
00:19:01.208 --> 00:19:03.644
But I still can't crack the power.

220
00:19:04.144 --> 00:19:05.913
The power. The power.

221
00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:09.082
This is not a problem.

222
00:19:09.183 --> 00:19:11.852
The solution is right above us.

223
00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:15.489
The answer, the source.
That's why we're here.

224
00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:20.127
Gentlemen,

225
00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:24.665
what is at stake here?

226
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.702
I want you to think about this.

227
00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:34.775
Civilisation has been preserved

228
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:38.579
because the right people have had
the right idea at the right time.

229
00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:42.182
This technology,
it comes along once in a generation,

230
00:19:44.718 --> 00:19:46.353
and it's a gift

231
00:19:48.422 --> 00:19:50.958
that has been put in our hands.

232
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.362
And why is that?

233
00:19:57.731 --> 00:19:59.299
It's because

234
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.835
we have a vision.

235
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:08.208
A vision for the future of this company,
of this nation,

236
00:20:10.144 --> 00:20:11.912
of the world order.

237
00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:15.115
Because, make no mistake,

238
00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:18.652
this tool that you're creating,
in the wrong hands

239
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.456
would end civilisation as we know it.

240
00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:27.461
Think about what's at stake here.

241
00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:37.471
Push it!

242
00:22:07.694 --> 00:22:08.929
No!

243
00:22:11.198 --> 00:22:13.600
Couldn't help yourself, could you?

244
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.339
- Don't mistake it for kindness.
- Oh, no.

245
00:22:19.439 --> 00:22:23.310
I've never mistaken anything
about you since you were a kid.

246
00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.147
Genie's out of the bottle.

247
00:22:29.116 --> 00:22:32.452
We gave a wonderful gift to the world.

248
00:22:42.062 --> 00:22:43.430
I'm stuck.

249
00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:47.034
We've done our part,

250
00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:54.408
now it's time for both of us to go.

251
00:22:54.508 --> 00:22:55.375
No!
