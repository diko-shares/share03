00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:15.961
Loki, once again, for crimes
against Asgard, you are banished to Earth.

2
00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:20.669
Ah. Where to? New York? London? Paris?

3
00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:22.086
Springfield.

4
00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.503
No!

5
00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:28.544
[screaming]

6
00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:32.253
Ow! [groans]

7
00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.628
Whoa. Hey, man. Can I help you?

8
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.919
What would you know
of a distant, abusive father?

9
00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:43.669
And a blonde-haired sibling
who's always perfect?

10
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:46.128
Oh, have I got the family for you.

11
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:48.461
So, the boy says you're magic.

12
00:00:48.544 --> 00:00:50.669
Can you turn one pork chop into two?

13
00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:54.919
I worship you, great Loki.

14
00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.919
Command me, O Lord.
I renounce all other gods.

15
00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:01.461
The last thing this world needs
is more pork chops.

16
00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:02.544
Get her!

17
00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.378
[growls]

18
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:06.544
No, Bart! I'm your sis--

19
00:01:08.044 --> 00:01:09.461
[wolf snoring]

20
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:17.669
[reading]

21
00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:22.419
Well, there's no way I'm worthy.
I'll just put it back.

22
00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:25.836
[grunting]

23
00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:27.878
Whoa!

24
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.628
Goodbye, self-esteem issues!

25
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.753
Ha!

26
00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:34.544
Lisa is Thor?

27
00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.419
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

28
00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:40.628
And I brought the Springfield Avengers
with me.

29
00:01:42.044 --> 00:01:43.044
[burps]

30
00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.503
I ruined my pants in a brand-new way.

31
00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:50.878
All right, they're no help.

32
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.628
But you're through here, Loki!

33
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:56.211
[Bart's voice] No, no! You're making
a big mistake. Homer, help me!

34
00:01:56.294 --> 00:01:57.253
[grunts]

35
00:01:57.336 --> 00:01:58.919
No! Homer, I'm really--

36
00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:00.878
Ay, caramba!

37
00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.669
[cheering, whistling]

38
00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:06.878
[Loki's voice, laughs]

39
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:08.753
[Homer humming]

40
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.086
-Whoa!
-We love you so much, boy.

41
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:16.419
Yes, Father.

42
00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:20.753
Oh, and tomorrow could you turn Flanders
into a pork chop? I'll do the rest.

43
00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:21.836
Yes, Father.

44
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:25.628
Finally, a functional family.

45
00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:45.461
Gee, Moe, I can't believe
you gave us drinks on the house tonight.

46
00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:47.586
That's because I ain't Moe.

47
00:02:48.586 --> 00:02:49.878
I'm Loki.

48
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.503
And these beers will ruin your lives,

49
00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:55.086
dissolve your livers,
fill you with remorse.

50
00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.753
And though they say
these bottles are recyclable,

51
00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:00.461
they just fill up the ocean!

52
00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:03.211
Your planet is dying!

53
00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:05.544
Still worth it.

54
00:03:27.044 --> 00:03:28.419
You're not nice!

55
00:03:28.503 --> 00:03:29.836
[grunts]

56
00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.211
-[Loki groaning]
-[Ralph grunting]

57
00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:35.294
[chuckles]

58
00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:36.919
Privacy please.

59
00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.544
-[chattering]
-Shh!

60
00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:55.503
[Loki grunts]

61
00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:59.086
Loki, I could give my verdict
in two words or less,

62
00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.044
but as you would put it,

63
00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:03.753
you stand here accused
of tampering with the sacred timeline,

64
00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:06.253
philosophically opposing predeterminism,

65
00:04:06.336 --> 00:04:09.003
crossing over into forbidden areas
of Disney+,

66
00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.419
taking two spots in the Goofy parking lot,

67
00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:13.669
being more popular than all the heroes,

68
00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.003
having a British accent when you're
actually supposed to be from Norway,

69
00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:21.086
promising to be good, then breaking
your promise like a zillion times,

70
00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.461
making us sit through
numerous mid-credits scenes,

71
00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:24.961
hoping they advance the story!

72
00:04:25.044 --> 00:04:28.794
And will you please wash your nasty hair?

73
00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:30.378
Guilty as charged!

74
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.169
Get out of my face.
