1
00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:13.972
Loki, once again, for crimes
against Asgard, you are banished to Earth.

2
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:18.685
Ah. Where to? New York? London? Paris?

3
00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.103
Springfield.

4
00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.523
No!

5
00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.568
[screaming]

6
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.280
Ow! [groans]

7
00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.657
Whoa. Hey, man. Can I help you?

8
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.953
What would you know
of a distant, abusive father?

9
00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:41.708
And a blonde-haired sibling
who's always perfect?

10
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.127
Oh, have I got the family for you.

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.463
So, the boy says you're magic.

12
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.673
Can you turn one pork chop into two?

13
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.927
I worship you, great Loki.

14
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.930
Command me, O Lord.
I renounce all other gods.

15
00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:59.476
The last thing this world needs
is more pork chops.

16
00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.560
Get her!

17
00:01:00.643 --> 00:01:02.395
[growls]

18
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.564
No, Bart! I'm your sis--

19
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.484
[wolf snoring]

20
00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:15.700
[reading]

21
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:20.455
Well, there's no way I'm worthy.
I'll just put it back.

22
00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.875
[grunting]

23
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.877
Whoa!

24
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.631
Goodbye, self-esteem issues!

25
00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:30.757
Ha!

26
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.550
Lisa is Thor?

27
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.427
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

28
00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:38.640
And I brought the Springfield Avengers
with me.

29
00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:41.059
[burps]

30
00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.524
I ruined my pants in a brand-new way.

31
00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.900
All right, they're no help.

32
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:51.653
But you're through here, Loki!

33
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.239
[Bart's voice] No, no! You're making
a big mistake. Homer, help me!

34
00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:55.281
[grunts]

35
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.950
No! Homer, I'm really--

36
00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.910
Ay, caramba!

37
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.706
[cheering, whistling]

38
00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:04.916
[Loki's voice, laughs]

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.751
[Homer humming]

40
00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.090
-Whoa!
-We love you so much, boy.

41
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.426
Yes, Father.

42
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.763
Oh, and tomorrow could you turn Flanders
into a pork chop? I'll do the rest.

43
00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:19.848
Yes, Father.

44
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.643
Finally, a functional family.

45
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.496
Gee, Moe, I can't believe
you gave us drinks on the house tonight.

46
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.623
That's because I ain't Moe.

47
00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:47.917
I'm Loki.

48
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.503
And these beers will ruin your lives,

49
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.089
dissolve your livers,
fill you with remorse.

50
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.759
And though they say
these bottles are recyclable,

51
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.470
they just fill up the ocean!

52
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.222
Your planet is dying!

53
00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:03.558
Still worth it.

54
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.456
You're not nice!

55
00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.874
[grunts]

56
00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:32.212
-[Loki groaning]
-[Ralph grunting]

57
00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.296
[chuckles]

58
00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:34.923
Privacy please.

59
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.550
-[chattering]
-Shh!

60
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:53.525
[Loki grunts]

61
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:57.112
Loki, I could give my verdict
in two words or less,

62
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:59.072
but as you would put it,

63
00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:01.783
you stand here accused
of tampering with the sacred timeline,

64
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.285
philosophically opposing predeterminism,

65
00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:07.038
crossing over into forbidden areas
of Disney+,

66
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:09.457
taking two spots in the Goofy parking lot,

67
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:11.668
being more popular than all the heroes,

68
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.005
having a British accent when you're
actually supposed to be from Norway,

69
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:19.092
promising to be good, then breaking
your promise like a zillion times,

70
00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.469
making us sit through
numerous mid-credits scenes,

71
00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:22.971
hoping they advance the story!

72
00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:26.808
And will you please wash your nasty hair?

73
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.393
Guilty as charged!

74
00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.186
Get out of my face.
