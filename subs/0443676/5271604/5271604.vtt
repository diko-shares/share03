00:01:40.555 --> 00:02:30.439


2
00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:31.639
Ten more minutes.

3
00:02:32.723 --> 00:02:34.308
Are you ready?

4
00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:39.855
Get the fuck out of here!

5
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.034
Stop! Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

6
00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:56.370
"Jrabbren"

7
00:02:56.412 --> 00:02:57.371
I said "krabren".

8
00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:58.372
No! No!

9
00:02:59.832 --> 00:03:02.542
Jrabbren.

10
00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:03.668
J-j-j--
I can't say that shit!

11
00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:05.086
Hey, Phil!

12
00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:06.379
How many times we got
to go through that?

13
00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:09.716
Could we just change
that last line?

14
00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.891
We'll have to do it again.

15
00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:21.727
Man, fuck this shit!

16
00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.020
Hold on.

17
00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:27.232
George... Listen to me.

18
00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.776
You're not the champ anymore,
you understand me?

19
00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:33.321
In fact, right now
all you are is broke.

20
00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:35.072
Now, we traveled a long way.

21
00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.991
I'm trying to get you
back on your feet.

22
00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:39.576
I'm trying to get you paid.

23
00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:40.827
So do me this favor.

24
00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:41.870
Please, just do what he asks.

25
00:03:41.953 --> 00:03:43.246
Let's give it another shot, huh?

26
00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:44.289
- But listen--
- No, no, no.

27
00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:45.665
No "but listen".

28
00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:47.542
You just do your job, we smile...

29
00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:50.336
go out to dinner with
these corporate cocksuckers...

30
00:03:50.378 --> 00:03:52.380
and you go home a richer man.

31
00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:44.177
Whoa.

32
00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:50.433
Hmm.

33
00:04:50.475 --> 00:04:51.809
Oops!

34
00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:57.064
Our customers are very excited.

35
00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.982
When the hell does
the fight start?

36
00:04:59.024 --> 00:05:00.692
It should start any second.

37
00:05:01.693 --> 00:05:02.736
What are we giving?

38
00:05:03.778 --> 00:05:06.781
The bets from the clubs
are 5 to 1, Boyka.

39
00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:12.286
Markov says this, uh, new fighter
is extremely good.

40
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.497
Heard that one before.

41
00:05:15.706 --> 00:05:18.709
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

42
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:23.130
Boyka! Boyka!
Boyka! Boyka!

43
00:05:29.635 --> 00:05:32.346
Boyka, Boyka!

44
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:55.743
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

45
00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:58.412
Broadcasting
live and exclusively...

46
00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:01.748
to select establishments
across Russia and Europe.

47
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.959
In this evening's bout...

48
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.461
weighing in at 104 kilos...

49
00:06:06.503 --> 00:06:09.797
fighting out of Kyrov
penitentiary in Siberia...

50
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.092
with a record of 14 wins
and no defeats...

51
00:06:13.134 --> 00:06:16.220
convicted of
second degree homicide...

52
00:06:16.262 --> 00:06:18.347
our challenger...

53
00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.475
Arkady Daviiiic!

54
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:27.939
And defending
his unbeaten run...

55
00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:31.943
of 34 consecutive fights
without defeat...

56
00:06:31.943 --> 00:06:35.362
convicted of 3 counts of
homicide in the first degree...

57
00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:37.948
weighing in at 92 kilos...

58
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.951
our own undisputed champion...

59
00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:45.914
Uri Boyka!
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

60
00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:49.834
Boyka, Boyka!

61
00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.837
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

62
00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:55.881
Boyka, Boyka!

63
00:06:55.923 --> 00:06:58.926
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

64
00:07:43.842 --> 00:07:45.802
Gentlemen, remember...

65
00:07:45.844 --> 00:07:48.554
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

66
00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:50.848
Fight!

67
00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.478
Uh!

68
00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.479
Unh! Ah!

69
00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:58.981
- Uh! Argh!
- Ah!

70
00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:02.150
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

71
00:08:03.193 --> 00:08:04.653
- Ha!
- Unh!

72
00:08:05.695 --> 00:08:06.654
Argh!

73
00:08:08.615 --> 00:08:10.450
- Argh!
- Boyka!

74
00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:15.996
Aaah!

75
00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:17.164
Uh!

76
00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:19.583
Ugh! Uh!

77
00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:22.544
Uh!

78
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.297
Argh!

79
00:08:28.424 --> 00:08:29.676
Argh!

80
00:08:29.717 --> 00:08:30.718
Unh! Oh!

81
00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:31.719
Bah!

82
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.346
Boyka, Boyka!

83
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:36.473
Boyka, Boyka!

84
00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:39.351
To success!

85
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:48.901
Here he is.

86
00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:50.278
Excuse me.

87
00:08:54.865 --> 00:08:57.409
George, you are an hour
late for the dinner.

88
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:59.578
Oh, my bad. I forgot
all about this dinner.

89
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.038
Mr. Chambers.

90
00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:03.331
The ad execs are
getting pissed off.

91
00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:05.500
Come in. Have a drink. We'll go.

92
00:09:05.542 --> 00:09:06.501
All right.
Let me change clothes.

93
00:09:06.584 --> 00:09:07.836
- Gimme 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes?

94
00:09:07.877 --> 00:09:09.170
On top of an hour?

95
00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:11.088
Hey, listen, this brown nosing
and breaking bread bullshit--

96
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.840
That's your job.
I did mine already.

97
00:09:12.882 --> 00:09:13.883
They can kiss this ass.

98
00:09:13.924 --> 00:09:15.676
Tell you what, 20 minutes.

99
00:09:15.718 --> 00:09:17.094
Raah!

100
00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:18.429
Argh!

101
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.429
Uh!

102
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:20.430
Uh!

103
00:09:20.472 --> 00:09:22.057
Argh!

104
00:09:22.099 --> 00:09:23.683
Unh! Uh!

105
00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:24.726
Ah!

106
00:09:25.935 --> 00:09:27.520
Argh!

107
00:09:30.106 --> 00:09:31.816
- Unh!
- Yes!

108
00:09:32.817 --> 00:09:33.901
- Unh!
- Argh!

109
00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:38.322
Argh!

110
00:09:40.866 --> 00:09:42.576
Get up! Finish him!

111
00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:44.202
Now!

112
00:09:44.286 --> 00:09:45.578
Aaaah!

113
00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:51.042
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

114
00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:16.148
Unh!

115
00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:18.358
Uh! Oh!

116
00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.235
Argh!

117
00:10:22.112 --> 00:10:23.738
Uh! Ugh!

118
00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:25.323
What the fuck are
you doing in my--

119
00:10:25.407 --> 00:10:26.908
Ugh!

120
00:10:37.918 --> 00:10:39.795
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

121
00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:40.837
Stop!

122
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:42.297
Boyka, Boyka!

123
00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:55.142
Argh!

124
00:10:55.184 --> 00:10:56.143
Uh!

125
00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:57.144
Argh!

126
00:10:57.144 --> 00:10:58.270
Unh!

127
00:11:02.441 --> 00:11:05.443
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

128
00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:08.321
Raaah!

129
00:11:09.322 --> 00:11:11.365
Raah!

130
00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:13.576
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

131
00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:23.001
There.

132
00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:40.684
If we cannot get
better odds against Boyka...

133
00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:43.311
we will have to shut down
by spring.

134
00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:45.522
It cannot keep
going on like this.

135
00:11:45.563 --> 00:11:48.566
Don't worry. It won't.

136
00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:52.820
They said nobody saw
these guys, George.

137
00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:54.822
What, they ain't got
no surveillance cameras out here?

138
00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:55.865
I don't know.

139
00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:58.117
You really don't think
I did this shit.

140
00:12:03.955 --> 00:12:06.958
Another easy fight, eh, champ?

141
00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:09.502
No one's ever
gonna stop you, huh?

142
00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:14.799
When you get out
of here some day...

143
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.092
you'll be the richest man
in Kiev.

144
00:12:17.134 --> 00:12:18.719
I just hope
you'll remember me--

145
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:20.220
Aah!

146
00:12:23.682 --> 00:12:24.683
It was an accident.

147
00:12:27.519 --> 00:12:28.770
Put out your hand.

148
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:30.813
No.

149
00:12:32.648 --> 00:12:33.816
Boyka.

150
00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:34.859
Did you hear?

151
00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:36.151
Hear what?

152
00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:38.654
He is coming.

153
00:12:38.695 --> 00:12:41.073
The police is already
in his room.

154
00:12:41.114 --> 00:12:42.449
He'll be here
tomorrow.

155
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.079
Aaah!

156
00:13:08.056 --> 00:13:10.141
This is your Bible?

157
00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:14.061
Why, yes, sir.

158
00:13:14.103 --> 00:13:17.147
I take the Good Book
with me everywhere I go.

159
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:18.482
Mmm.

160
00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.445
That is not mine.

161
00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:32.578
Then this must
not be yours, too.

162
00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:35.122
No, it isn't.

163
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:41.920
What the hell
is going on here?

164
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.296
They're setting me up.

165
00:13:48.092 --> 00:13:50.970
American boxer George Chambers
has been transferred...

166
00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:53.889
to a maximum security
jail to await charges.

167
00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:57.226
Convicted of a controversial
assault charge 6 years ago...

168
00:13:57.267 --> 00:14:01.229
the former Heavyweight Champion
of the World was also cautioned...

169
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:03.732
in 1993 over the possession
of illegal painkillers.

170
00:14:03.773 --> 00:14:06.276
Our sources have indicated
that the quantity...

171
00:14:06.317 --> 00:14:08.736
of narcotics involved
is well over the threshold...

172
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.196
for a trafficking charge.

173
00:14:10.196 --> 00:14:12.990
This is Maria Alonso
reporting from Russia.

174
00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.262
He just arrived.

175
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.865
Fuck are y'all lookin' at?

176
00:16:28.656 --> 00:16:29.907
Yeah.

177
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.914
Good evening, Mr. Chambers.

178
00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:40.375
I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

179
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:44.504
Now, you and I both know you don't
give a damn how my journey was.

180
00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.756
I understand you have
been to prison before...

181
00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.675
in the United States.

182
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:51.594
And don't pretend
that you don't know...

183
00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:52.720
who the hell I am, either.

184
00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.430
I was a big fan of yours...

185
00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.016
during height of your career.

186
00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.935
In fact, we all are very
excited you are here.

187
00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:01.395
Don't get too excited,
'cause I plan on walking...

188
00:17:01.436 --> 00:17:03.813
straight outta here as soon as
this shit's straightened out.

189
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.941
Perhaps.

190
00:17:06.983 --> 00:17:08.318
But in the meantime...

191
00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:10.278
you should know that
in this facility...

192
00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.029
we think very highly of fighters.

193
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:14.865
In fact, we even have
our own champion.

194
00:17:14.907 --> 00:17:17.284
You ain't hearing me,
Colonel Klink.

195
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:19.411
I told you. I don't plan
on staying here long.

196
00:17:58.822 --> 00:18:01.366
Fuck y'all. Heat this shit up.

197
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.206
You take shower now.

198
00:18:09.332 --> 00:18:12.710
Go... fuck... yourself.

199
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:16.922
Ugh!

200
00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:17.965
Ugh!

201
00:18:17.965 --> 00:18:19.883
Argh! Ow!

202
00:18:20.884 --> 00:18:22.135
Ugh!

203
00:18:23.178 --> 00:18:24.804
Ugh!

204
00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:40.485
Hmm.

205
00:18:50.703 --> 00:18:52.913
Ha ha ha!

206
00:18:56.417 --> 00:19:00.212
Champ, gift from Boyka.
Warm piss.

207
00:19:00.254 --> 00:19:01.672
- Unh!
- Ugh!

208
00:19:01.713 --> 00:19:02.672
Argh!

209
00:19:05.592 --> 00:19:06.759
Ugh!

210
00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:07.886
Unh!

211
00:19:07.927 --> 00:19:09.637
Argh!

212
00:19:09.637 --> 00:19:11.055
Oh!

213
00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:32.782
Are you all right, chum?

214
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:36.369
Turn around, get the fuck
out of my face!

215
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.205
Got it.

216
00:19:45.085 --> 00:19:48.129
Ugh!
This is bullshit!

217
00:20:32.003 --> 00:20:34.839
I don't mean
to bother you, but...

218
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:36.424
you better get up.

219
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:41.428
Look, if you
don't leave your cell...

220
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.640
when they unlock the door,
they'll lock it again.

221
00:20:44.681 --> 00:20:46.641
You won't eat or get air
for the rest of the day.

222
00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.230
Not that either
of those things...

223
00:20:52.313 --> 00:20:53.523
are particularly
pleasant out here.

224
00:20:53.564 --> 00:20:55.483
Yo, dude...

225
00:20:55.483 --> 00:20:57.485
Iet's get one thing straight.

226
00:20:58.819 --> 00:21:01.030
Now, I don't need to learn
the ropes around here...

227
00:21:01.071 --> 00:21:02.906
you feel me?

228
00:21:02.948 --> 00:21:05.283
Sure, Mr. Chambers.

229
00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:07.035
Of course.

230
00:21:53.661 --> 00:21:55.037
Move!

231
00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:57.206
Hey, man, what the fuck?
Man, you blind, too?

232
00:21:57.248 --> 00:21:58.791
Ignore him.

233
00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:01.251
He's a bit crazy.

234
00:22:01.335 --> 00:22:02.836
Been here too long,
you know what I mean?

235
00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.756
Lives underground. Only
comes up here at mealtimes.

236
00:22:12.303 --> 00:22:15.348
Not exactly five star, is it?

237
00:22:41.538 --> 00:22:44.499
Uh... do you mind
if I join you?

238
00:22:58.637 --> 00:23:01.348
Yo, dude, why do you keep
staring at me like that?

239
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.767
I'm sorry.

240
00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.602
It's just--

241
00:23:05.644 --> 00:23:07.687
Well, it's incredible
that I'm sharing a cell...

242
00:23:07.771 --> 00:23:09.981
with George Chambers here.

243
00:23:14.318 --> 00:23:16.237
Steven Parker.

244
00:23:22.326 --> 00:23:23.827
I suggest you stand up.

245
00:23:25.078 --> 00:23:26.663
Unh!

246
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.091
Look, I don't want
to be pushy, man...

247
00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:40.426
but you don't want
to mess with Boyka.

248
00:24:00.527 --> 00:24:02.571
You, stand!

249
00:24:08.118 --> 00:24:11.663
You stand up... now!

250
00:24:11.704 --> 00:24:12.705
Mmf!

251
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.207
- Unh!
- Ugh!

252
00:24:30.138 --> 00:24:31.598
Boyka, huh?

253
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.521
Now, what kind of
bitch ass name is that?

254
00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:43.859
You were great champion. I know.

255
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.195
Long time ago. Long time.

256
00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:52.158
But in here, I am the champion.

257
00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:53.576
And you...

258
00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:58.372
You are just my bi--

259
00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.550
Raaah!

260
00:25:26.523 --> 00:25:28.233
Let's go, motherfucker!

261
00:25:28.275 --> 00:25:30.860
Bring it! Bring it!

262
00:25:30.902 --> 00:25:32.528
Let's go right now!

263
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.280
Fuck you!

264
00:25:38.033 --> 00:25:39.410
Why did you stop me?!

265
00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:41.829
You think I'm afraid of
that fucking oaf?

266
00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:44.247
Uri, I told you you'll
have your own shot at him.

267
00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:46.791
I had my shot at him!

268
00:25:46.833 --> 00:25:49.085
And then your guards
stepped in to save him!

269
00:25:49.085 --> 00:25:50.420
How do you think that looks?!

270
00:25:50.503 --> 00:25:51.921
Look, we help.

271
00:25:51.963 --> 00:25:53.589
I didn't ask you.

272
00:25:56.842 --> 00:25:58.802
You cannot stop me from
doing what I have to do.

273
00:25:58.844 --> 00:26:00.929
No one wants to stop you.

274
00:26:01.013 --> 00:26:02.806
We're just telling you
we have to be sure...

275
00:26:02.848 --> 00:26:04.850
it is in the ring!

276
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.769
Argh!

277
00:26:09.604 --> 00:26:11.147
Some bad news.

278
00:26:11.147 --> 00:26:12.857
They're not offering bail.

279
00:26:12.899 --> 00:26:14.275
Did you call Ruben in L.A.?

280
00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:16.652
George, Ruben is
an American attorney.

281
00:26:16.694 --> 00:26:17.987
He can't help with this.

282
00:26:18.028 --> 00:26:20.364
Did you even call-- Listen.

283
00:26:20.406 --> 00:26:23.825
You better tell me something
I wanna hear right now.

284
00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:25.118
I've already been
to the embassy.

285
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.495
They're very upbeat.

286
00:26:26.578 --> 00:26:28.246
But they're telling me
the process can take...

287
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.622
anywhere from a month--

288
00:26:29.706 --> 00:26:31.249
A month?!

289
00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:33.709
What the fuck
you talking about?!

290
00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:36.128
Now, Phil, I swear to God...

291
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.255
you better turn around and
get me a team of lawyers...

292
00:26:38.339 --> 00:26:39.673
and get me
the fuck out of here!

293
00:26:39.715 --> 00:26:40.841
I will.

294
00:26:40.883 --> 00:26:43.093
It's just gonna take
a little bit more time.

295
00:26:44.469 --> 00:26:45.720
You fucking clown!

296
00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:48.348
You know what it feels like
to be in here for nothing, huh?

297
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.891
You're bullshittin' me!

298
00:26:49.933 --> 00:26:53.144
Just be patient, George!
I'm doing everything I can!

299
00:27:00.025 --> 00:27:02.486
My dear friend, Markov.

300
00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:04.154
So, where are we?

301
00:27:04.237 --> 00:27:06.531
He's uncomfortable.

302
00:27:06.573 --> 00:27:08.116
That's a good first step.

303
00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:11.536
I don't need first steps.
I need them to fight.

304
00:27:11.578 --> 00:27:14.163
There's already bad blood
between him and Boyka.

305
00:27:14.205 --> 00:27:15.831
I think he'll--he'll-- he'll fight.

306
00:27:15.873 --> 00:27:16.832
- You think?
- Yeah.

307
00:27:16.874 --> 00:27:18.584
Well, that's a nice surprise.

308
00:27:18.626 --> 00:27:20.711
"Think" isn't
good enough, Markov.

309
00:27:20.753 --> 00:27:22.504
I have to start making
arrangements now.

310
00:27:22.546 --> 00:27:23.505
Eh... sure.

311
00:27:23.547 --> 00:27:24.840
Th-th-the only
problem is, eh,

312
00:27:24.881 --> 00:27:27.801
this idiot hopes
he'll go free any day.

313
00:27:27.842 --> 00:27:29.344
Yeah...

314
00:27:29.386 --> 00:27:31.179
Well, I'll handle that.

315
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:33.431
You just take care
of the fight.

316
00:27:33.473 --> 00:27:35.433
- And Markov...
- Yeah?

317
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:40.979
Don't disappoint me, ok?

318
00:27:47.068 --> 00:27:49.237
I said, enough!

319
00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:51.155
What the fuck's going on?!
Why are you doing this?!

320
00:27:54.575 --> 00:27:55.993
Ugh!

321
00:27:56.035 --> 00:27:57.912
Ow, unh!

322
00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:15.720
Argh!

323
00:28:16.887 --> 00:28:18.639
Ugh, uh!

324
00:28:19.932 --> 00:28:21.433
Argh!

325
00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:23.477
Unh!

326
00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.519
Aah!

327
00:28:26.062 --> 00:28:27.063
Aaargh!

328
00:28:27.063 --> 00:28:28.231
Ow!

329
00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:34.112
Ugh! Unh! Ugh!

330
00:28:34.153 --> 00:28:36.197
Ow!

331
00:28:52.378 --> 00:28:53.713
Thank you.

332
00:28:53.755 --> 00:28:55.756
What the hell was that about?

333
00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:57.633
Nothing.

334
00:28:57.675 --> 00:29:00.928
But thanks for
your help anyway.

335
00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:02.971
Well, don't take it
personally, junkie.

336
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:05.223
I just don't like seeing
people getting bullied.

337
00:29:05.265 --> 00:29:07.267
Unless it's me
doing the bullying.

338
00:29:08.977 --> 00:29:11.104
Listen, Mr. Chambers...

339
00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:13.731
there's something you ought
to know about this place.

340
00:29:13.815 --> 00:29:16.442
E-even when you're getting
out any day, of course.

341
00:29:17.985 --> 00:29:20.070
What?

342
00:29:20.112 --> 00:29:21.864
It's owned by the mob.

343
00:29:21.905 --> 00:29:24.616
I mean...
One man, really.

344
00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:27.535
He owns the cons,
he owns the cops.

345
00:29:27.535 --> 00:29:29.746
Ha! He's name is Gaga.

346
00:29:29.788 --> 00:29:31.122
Ha ha ha!

347
00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:32.957
- Gaga?
- Yeah.

348
00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:34.208
So why are you telling me?

349
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.169
Just thought it best
if--if--if--if you...

350
00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:39.630
If I what?

351
00:29:39.672 --> 00:29:40.756
Go with the program.

352
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:43.884
Best way to stay healthy.

353
00:29:43.926 --> 00:29:46.303
Hey! I got my own way
of staying healthy.

354
00:29:46.386 --> 00:29:47.470
What's that?

355
00:29:47.554 --> 00:29:48.930
Knock the other
son of a bitch out...

356
00:29:48.972 --> 00:29:50.849
before he gets a chance
to do it to me.

357
00:30:05.487 --> 00:30:06.655
What happened?!

358
00:30:08.782 --> 00:30:10.033
What?!

359
00:30:15.997 --> 00:30:18.415
You think you come in here
and do what you want?!

360
00:30:18.457 --> 00:30:20.751
Fuck you! This is my world.

361
00:30:20.834 --> 00:30:22.544
Motherfucker,
keep your world.

362
00:30:22.628 --> 00:30:23.795
I don't want this shit.

363
00:30:23.837 --> 00:30:25.547
And anyway, why you talking
to me right now, man?

364
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.424
Either throw your hands
or step the fuck--

365
00:30:27.465 --> 00:30:29.259
- If you're so tough, then fight me!
- Bitch ass motherfucker!

366
00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.760
In the ring!

367
00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:31.761
Man, fuck the ring!

368
00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:32.970
We can do this shit right now.

369
00:30:33.012 --> 00:30:35.264
Bitch-ass punk!

370
00:30:40.644 --> 00:30:42.813
Fuck you! Fight me in the ring!

371
00:30:42.855 --> 00:30:45.148
Right now!
I'll take you right here!

372
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:46.525
- Come on!
- Come on!

373
00:30:46.525 --> 00:30:47.609
What you got for me?

374
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:48.860
Fuck you!

375
00:30:48.902 --> 00:30:50.904
I'll fight you right now,
motherfucker! Come on!

376
00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:53.031
- In the ring!
- Fuck that!

377
00:30:54.532 --> 00:30:57.243
You have to concentrate
on one fight at a time.

378
00:30:57.284 --> 00:30:58.452
Forget the American--

379
00:30:58.536 --> 00:31:01.997
Shut up! Do your fucking job!

380
00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:08.211
Heavyweight Champion
of the World.

381
00:31:08.253 --> 00:31:10.547
I'll rip his fucking head off!

382
00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:13.424
Of course you will.

383
00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:15.885
But tonight you rip
someone else's head off, ok?

384
00:31:15.927 --> 00:31:17.344
Shut up!

385
00:31:19.138 --> 00:31:20.973
Boyka.

386
00:31:21.015 --> 00:31:22.391
So what are the bets?

387
00:31:22.474 --> 00:31:25.185
250,000 across
the first 3 rounds...

388
00:31:25.227 --> 00:31:27.270
and another 20 across 4 and 5.

389
00:31:27.395 --> 00:31:30.064
Could be a lot better.
Give me the phone.

390
00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:34.026
Markov.

391
00:31:34.068 --> 00:31:35.403
What the hell's going on?

392
00:31:35.444 --> 00:31:37.863
Fight starts in 15 minutes.

393
00:31:37.905 --> 00:31:39.448
I'm walking to
the arena right now.

394
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:40.866
That's not what
I'm talking about.

395
00:31:40.908 --> 00:31:42.701
What the fuck's going
on with Chambers?

396
00:31:42.743 --> 00:31:44.619
We're doing everything
we can, Gaga.

397
00:31:44.661 --> 00:31:47.914
You better do more, my friend.
You better do more, understand?

398
00:31:47.956 --> 00:31:48.915
Yes.

399
00:31:48.915 --> 00:31:49.958
Boyka, Boyka!

400
00:31:54.754 --> 00:31:55.838
Fight!

401
00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:01.218
Unh!

402
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:03.345
Unh! Ugh!

403
00:32:03.428 --> 00:32:04.513
Ugh!

404
00:32:04.554 --> 00:32:05.972
Boyka! Boyka!

405
00:32:06.014 --> 00:32:07.515
Raaah!

406
00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:10.226
Boyka! Boyka!

407
00:32:10.268 --> 00:32:11.227
Unh!

408
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:13.021
Unh! Uh!

409
00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:18.859
Arghhh.

410
00:32:19.902 --> 00:32:21.111
Unh!

411
00:32:22.654 --> 00:32:24.406
Raah!

412
00:32:24.448 --> 00:32:25.907
Boyka!

413
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:27.951
Ugh!

414
00:32:30.495 --> 00:32:31.746
Unh! Ah!

415
00:32:33.247 --> 00:32:34.248
Uh!

416
00:32:34.332 --> 00:32:36.292
Ow!

417
00:32:37.918 --> 00:32:39.878
Argh! Argh!

418
00:32:41.964 --> 00:32:43.548
Boyka!

419
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:47.093
Unh! Ow!

420
00:32:47.135 --> 00:32:48.762
Argh!

421
00:32:48.803 --> 00:32:50.555
Ow!

422
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.350
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

423
00:32:55.351 --> 00:32:57.520
Unh! Yaah!

424
00:32:57.561 --> 00:32:58.812
Yah!

425
00:32:58.854 --> 00:32:59.855
Ow!

426
00:33:01.607 --> 00:33:03.400
Arrrrgh!

427
00:33:03.442 --> 00:33:05.277
Unh! Unh!

428
00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:08.071
Ow!

429
00:33:10.949 --> 00:33:13.076
Unh!

430
00:33:14.118 --> 00:33:16.746
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

431
00:33:16.746 --> 00:33:18.539
Boyka! Boyka!

432
00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:20.374
Unh!

433
00:33:22.167 --> 00:33:23.460
Boyka! Boyka!

434
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.420
Unh! Unh! Unh!

435
00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:29.507
Stop! Stop!

436
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:31.009
Unh!

437
00:33:31.092 --> 00:33:34.804
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

438
00:33:34.846 --> 00:33:36.639
Argh!

439
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:43.812
Argh!

440
00:33:46.148 --> 00:33:47.440
Unh!

441
00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:12.922
Warden wants to see you.

442
00:34:13.005 --> 00:34:15.841
Only person I wanna see
is from the U.S. embassy.

443
00:34:16.842 --> 00:34:18.385
You see warden now.

444
00:34:24.266 --> 00:34:25.767
Ugh!

445
00:34:39.363 --> 00:34:40.322
Motherfuck--!

446
00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:42.366
Ugh!

447
00:34:44.076 --> 00:34:45.327
That's enough.

448
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.788
Mr. Chambers...

449
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.459
you are making things
very difficult on yourself.

450
00:34:53.543 --> 00:34:57.630
There's a way you can make
your time here much easier.

451
00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:02.050
You've seen now
our resident champion...

452
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.344
Uri Boyka, in action.

453
00:35:04.386 --> 00:35:06.930
We want to arrange a fight
between the two of you.

454
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.515
I ain't fighting, man!

455
00:35:08.556 --> 00:35:11.392
I wouldn't take part in
this circus brawl bullshit...

456
00:35:11.434 --> 00:35:13.352
you got going on here anyway.

457
00:35:13.394 --> 00:35:15.521
The hell you call that shit?

458
00:35:15.563 --> 00:35:17.440
A sport?

459
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:20.609
As I was saying,
if you fight...

460
00:35:20.693 --> 00:35:23.403
you'll find that
things could become...

461
00:35:23.487 --> 00:35:25.739
much more pleasant
around here.

462
00:35:25.781 --> 00:35:27.866
Who knows? You could
even find yourself...

463
00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:30.994
on a plane heading home.

464
00:35:33.329 --> 00:35:36.374
Fine. Have it your way.

465
00:35:40.878 --> 00:35:43.589
Sewage duct for whole prison.

466
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.465
Very old.

467
00:35:45.507 --> 00:35:47.592
Clogged every day.

468
00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.220
Go!

469
00:35:51.262 --> 00:35:52.764
Uh, hell no!

470
00:35:53.973 --> 00:35:54.974
Go!

471
00:35:55.975 --> 00:35:57.977
Get that shit out of my face!

472
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.190
Go get it.

473
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.651
Fuck you!

474
00:36:14.992 --> 00:36:18.662
If you don't work,
then we'll make you work.

475
00:36:18.704 --> 00:36:19.663
Heh.

476
00:36:19.705 --> 00:36:20.706
What?

477
00:36:24.209 --> 00:36:26.461
Don't give these
gorillas an excuse.

478
00:36:34.385 --> 00:36:36.387
It's not worth it.

479
00:37:06.373 --> 00:37:08.583
Give me number.

480
00:37:08.625 --> 00:37:10.627
On your shovel.

481
00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:14.422
Eighteen.

482
00:37:17.258 --> 00:37:21.011
You bring it back to me
when you've finished each day.

483
00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:25.182
Make sure you clean the shit
before you give it back.

484
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.864
Not bad for
an old Russian dude.

485
00:38:28.865 --> 00:38:30.825
I've had time to practice.

486
00:38:55.431 --> 00:38:57.600
Oh, Christ!

487
00:38:59.476 --> 00:39:01.979
Man, you truly stink.

488
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.856
Fuck you.

489
00:39:04.898 --> 00:39:08.068
Maybe I should ask
for a gas mask.

490
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:10.445
Or maybe transfer
to another cell.

491
00:39:10.487 --> 00:39:12.864
What, and miss out on
my sparkling conversation?

492
00:39:14.073 --> 00:39:16.909
Looks like Crot gave you
quite a hard time.

493
00:39:16.951 --> 00:39:18.119
Who?

494
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.745
The guy in the wheelchair, Crot.

495
00:39:19.828 --> 00:39:22.164
Crot is Russian for mole.

496
00:39:22.206 --> 00:39:23.415
You know...

497
00:39:24.666 --> 00:39:27.836
that guy used to be a commando
in the Russian army.

498
00:39:27.877 --> 00:39:31.005
I'm told that he was quite
a mean motherfucker back then.

499
00:39:31.047 --> 00:39:32.548
He even killed a prison guard.

500
00:39:33.758 --> 00:39:34.759
That old dude?

501
00:39:34.842 --> 00:39:36.427
Yeah.

502
00:39:36.469 --> 00:39:39.805
There's no way they're gonna
let him out of this shit hole.

503
00:39:39.847 --> 00:39:40.973
Hmm.

504
00:39:41.014 --> 00:39:42.641
But you, on the other hand...

505
00:39:42.683 --> 00:39:45.936
you're one of the lucky few
that does have a way out.

506
00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:47.604
Yeah? How so?

507
00:39:48.646 --> 00:39:51.357
Take Markov's offer.
Fight Boyka.

508
00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:33.646
Jesus, don't you
guys ever sleep?

509
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.819
Aah!

510
00:40:40.861 --> 00:40:42.571
Look at you, junkie fuck.

511
00:40:42.613 --> 00:40:44.406
C-can't--

512
00:40:44.406 --> 00:40:45.365
Argh!

513
00:40:45.407 --> 00:40:47.117
You're lucky
to still be breathing.

514
00:40:47.158 --> 00:40:48.243
Unh.

515
00:40:48.284 --> 00:40:51.204
If he doesn't fight soon,
your luck will end.

516
00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:56.792
Ah!

517
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:13.307
We bring you a message
from Boyka.

518
00:41:16.936 --> 00:41:18.395
Argh!

519
00:41:18.437 --> 00:41:20.647
Unh! Ow!

520
00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:23.400
Ow!

521
00:41:23.442 --> 00:41:26.111
Ugh!

522
00:41:26.153 --> 00:41:28.363
Aah!

523
00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:33.284
Argh!

524
00:41:34.827 --> 00:41:36.245
Hey!

525
00:41:42.084 --> 00:41:43.043
Ugh!

526
00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.427
Argh!

527
00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:53.678
Ow!

528
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:55.554
Unh!

529
00:41:56.597 --> 00:41:57.556
Oh!

530
00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:00.517
Uh!

531
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:02.060
- Uh!
- Uh!

532
00:42:03.061 --> 00:42:04.021
Ow!

533
00:42:05.063 --> 00:42:06.273
Ow!

534
00:42:09.692 --> 00:42:10.944
Argh!

535
00:42:21.578 --> 00:42:22.579
Move.

536
00:42:24.122 --> 00:42:25.082
Move.

537
00:42:34.215 --> 00:42:35.466
Ugh!

538
00:42:38.552 --> 00:42:40.012
Argh!

539
00:42:40.054 --> 00:42:42.431
Enjoy your new home.

540
00:42:50.104 --> 00:42:51.522
What?

541
00:42:51.564 --> 00:42:54.108
He's in the hole.

542
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.069
People change their minds
in that place.

543
00:42:57.111 --> 00:42:58.279
Good.

544
00:43:02.032 --> 00:43:03.242
Ugh.

545
00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:04.785
Ow!

546
00:43:28.807 --> 00:43:30.475
Hey.

547
00:43:30.517 --> 00:43:32.143
Stand up.

548
00:43:32.185 --> 00:43:34.061
Stand up. I have soup.

549
00:43:46.448 --> 00:43:48.491
Pills.

550
00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:52.829
Chew and swallow.

551
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.705
Help with your fever.

552
00:43:56.207 --> 00:43:57.666
Why are you doing this?

553
00:43:57.708 --> 00:43:59.376
Shut up and drink.

554
00:44:00.419 --> 00:44:01.879
And take this, too.

555
00:44:07.592 --> 00:44:08.843
Hey.

556
00:44:13.097 --> 00:44:14.515
Why are you doing this?

557
00:44:14.557 --> 00:44:17.268
Why do you care why I do it?

558
00:44:17.351 --> 00:44:21.522
'Cause where I'm from,
ain't nothin' free. Why?

559
00:44:21.563 --> 00:44:23.357
You never help anyone?

560
00:44:26.401 --> 00:44:27.819
Probably not.

561
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:29.779
Motherfucker,
you don't know me.

562
00:44:29.821 --> 00:44:32.073
That's why I bought
my mother a ten-bedroom house.

563
00:44:32.115 --> 00:44:34.116
I don't do for nobody, shit.

564
00:44:34.158 --> 00:44:36.452
You probably do
that for you, too.

565
00:44:36.494 --> 00:44:38.662
Hey, you know what
your problem is, old man?

566
00:44:38.704 --> 00:44:42.207
You been here too long.
You lost touch with reality.

567
00:44:42.291 --> 00:44:46.378
Your problem is that you're
not accepting reality.

568
00:44:46.419 --> 00:44:48.838
Reality is, I was framed.

569
00:44:48.922 --> 00:44:50.465
I don't belong here.

570
00:44:50.548 --> 00:44:52.383
And I ain't gonna
be here much longer.

571
00:44:52.425 --> 00:44:55.803
You still don't understand.

572
00:44:55.886 --> 00:44:58.639
They will never
let you out of here.

573
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:18.782
Get him cleaned up.

574
00:45:53.106 --> 00:45:55.066
It is Beluga caviar.

575
00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:58.110
25,000 American
dollars per kilo.

576
00:45:58.152 --> 00:46:00.446
Looks like rat shit to me.

577
00:46:00.487 --> 00:46:02.489
Smells like it, too.

578
00:46:02.573 --> 00:46:04.658
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Chambers?

579
00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:06.826
You're the big dog, right?

580
00:46:06.868 --> 00:46:10.497
Yeah. I'm the big dog.

581
00:46:10.538 --> 00:46:12.832
Ruff! Heh.

582
00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:15.793
I am the big dog
that brought you here.

583
00:46:15.835 --> 00:46:19.421
So... Mr. Big Dog...

584
00:46:19.463 --> 00:46:21.465
what makes you think
I won't jump up there...

585
00:46:21.507 --> 00:46:22.966
and make you a dead dog?

586
00:46:23.008 --> 00:46:24.926
Because I know
you're not stupid.

587
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.559
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Chambers.

588
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:35.728
I'm a business man.

589
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:39.398
And, uh, this is
a business situation.

590
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.441
Please.

591
00:46:43.026 --> 00:46:45.153
I brought you here.
I can let you out.

592
00:46:45.237 --> 00:46:48.156
The choice... is yours.

593
00:46:48.198 --> 00:46:51.242
You want me to fight
that clown Boyka, right?

594
00:46:51.284 --> 00:46:53.161
It will make me
very happy, yeah.

595
00:46:54.203 --> 00:46:55.663
And if I don't?

596
00:46:55.705 --> 00:46:57.206
Well...

597
00:46:57.248 --> 00:46:59.792
you could end up in this place
for a very long time.

598
00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:02.836
Maybe meet with an accident.
Perhaps stay forever.

599
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.839
Well as we speak, I got
my man working on turning...

600
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:08.842
this thing into the biggest
media circus you ever seen.

601
00:47:08.925 --> 00:47:11.219
Your man?

602
00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:12.220
Which one is this?

603
00:47:12.261 --> 00:47:13.471
My manager.

604
00:47:22.688 --> 00:47:24.106
Phil, what the fuck
are you doing up--

605
00:47:25.357 --> 00:47:27.692
Listen, George, everything
is going to be all right.

606
00:47:27.734 --> 00:47:29.861
Gaga here has a great plan.

607
00:47:29.903 --> 00:47:31.112
We're all gonna make
a ton of money.

608
00:47:32.322 --> 00:47:33.573
Oh, shit.

609
00:47:33.614 --> 00:47:35.491
They told me the whole thing
would be quick.

610
00:47:35.574 --> 00:47:36.867
That you'd be out in a week.

611
00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:41.580
The money is huge. It's what
we've been waiting for.

612
00:47:41.622 --> 00:47:44.416
You just need to stop being
so goddamned stubborn...

613
00:47:44.458 --> 00:47:46.001
and take the fight.

614
00:47:46.042 --> 00:47:50.046
Motherfucker! I'll kill
your motherfuckin' ass!

615
00:47:50.088 --> 00:47:52.006
Backstabbing son of a bitch!

616
00:47:52.048 --> 00:47:54.842
Don't be stupid.
Take the fight!

617
00:47:54.884 --> 00:47:57.845
Shut up, dead man!
Shut the fuck up!

618
00:47:57.887 --> 00:47:59.722
Fuck you!

619
00:48:10.273 --> 00:48:11.816
I have good news.

620
00:48:13.443 --> 00:48:14.402
Tell me.

621
00:48:14.443 --> 00:48:16.904
I'm so bloody excited, George.

622
00:48:17.029 --> 00:48:17.905
Why?

623
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.281
Why?

624
00:48:19.323 --> 00:48:22.117
You're going to fight
Boyka, that's why.

625
00:48:23.535 --> 00:48:25.662
Hey...

626
00:48:25.745 --> 00:48:28.790
You don't need
a cornerman, do you?

627
00:48:28.832 --> 00:48:30.708
Why, you got
somebody in mind?

628
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:33.294
George...

629
00:48:33.336 --> 00:48:35.129
I'm the only one you
can trust around here...

630
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.214
you know that, don't you?

631
00:48:51.227 --> 00:48:54.105
Can I ask you something, George?

632
00:48:54.147 --> 00:48:55.231
What?

633
00:48:56.899 --> 00:48:59.943
If you got out of here...

634
00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:02.779
what's the first thing you'd do?

635
00:49:02.779 --> 00:49:05.574
You mean "when" I get
out of here, right?

636
00:49:05.615 --> 00:49:06.867
Of course.

637
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.954
I don't know, Stevie.

638
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.459
I'd try to see my wife.

639
00:49:18.627 --> 00:49:20.504
You're married?

640
00:49:24.174 --> 00:49:25.717
I like to think so.

641
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:29.471
She ever visit you here?

642
00:49:29.512 --> 00:49:32.015
Once.

643
00:49:36.394 --> 00:49:38.854
She's got a boyfriend now.

644
00:49:38.896 --> 00:49:41.648
Commodities or something.

645
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:43.275
That's messed up, Stevie.

646
00:49:45.193 --> 00:49:48.238
Doesn't hurt anymore.

647
00:49:48.321 --> 00:49:50.031
Used to, you know?

648
00:49:51.949 --> 00:49:52.909
Not anymore.

649
00:49:55.161 --> 00:49:57.413
When are you getting
out of here, man?

650
00:49:59.206 --> 00:50:00.499
Ohh...

651
00:50:03.168 --> 00:50:04.503
twelve years.

652
00:50:04.544 --> 00:50:06.671
Damn!

653
00:50:07.672 --> 00:50:09.340
Stevie...

654
00:50:09.382 --> 00:50:12.093
you ever think about
cleaning your shit up?

655
00:50:19.058 --> 00:50:20.517
What for?

656
00:51:00.137 --> 00:51:01.221
Wow.

657
00:51:01.305 --> 00:51:02.890
See, Stevie,
don't hold it like that.

658
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:04.975
Hold it like this.
You hold it like this...

659
00:51:05.016 --> 00:51:06.226
you'll rip your shoulder
out of the socket.

660
00:51:06.268 --> 00:51:08.019
So hold it like that,
you got it?

661
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:10.396
- I think so.
- Don't worry.

662
00:51:10.438 --> 00:51:12.648
All right. Jab.

663
00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:14.233
Cross.

664
00:51:14.275 --> 00:51:15.651
Jab.

665
00:51:15.693 --> 00:51:17.194
Cross... jab.

666
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:50.475
Ugh.

667
00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.912
Hey. Hey.

668
00:52:12.954 --> 00:52:14.288
Hey!

669
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.208
Hey!

670
00:52:17.249 --> 00:52:19.918
Oh, for fuck's sake, man.

671
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:23.005
I did everything
you asked, didn't l?

672
00:52:23.088 --> 00:52:25.173
He's going to fight.

673
00:52:25.215 --> 00:52:28.009
We have one more job for you.

674
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:29.427
Understand?!

675
00:52:29.469 --> 00:52:32.055
Ha ha ha!

676
00:52:37.852 --> 00:52:38.811
How did I do?

677
00:52:38.852 --> 00:52:41.772
Not bad.

678
00:52:44.566 --> 00:52:46.401
Time.

679
00:52:46.484 --> 00:52:47.861
Let's do this.

680
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:52.240
Have our friend in London...

681
00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:54.116
put half a million on Boyka.

682
00:52:54.158 --> 00:52:55.743
Boyka?

683
00:52:55.785 --> 00:53:00.497
But, sir, 80 % of the money
coming in is on the American.

684
00:53:00.539 --> 00:53:02.124
Whatever you say, sir.

685
00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.333
Gentlemen!

686
00:53:03.375 --> 00:53:06.878
The fight you've
all been waiting for.

687
00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.007
To my right, fighting
out of the United States...

688
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:14.135
with a record of 38 victories...

689
00:53:14.218 --> 00:53:17.012
and no defeats...

690
00:53:17.054 --> 00:53:18.639
George...

691
00:53:18.722 --> 00:53:22.059
Iceman Chambeeeers!

692
00:53:28.982 --> 00:53:30.108
And to my left...

693
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.820
a man who needs no introduction.

694
00:53:33.861 --> 00:53:36.530
Our... own...

695
00:53:36.572 --> 00:53:39.158
undisputed champion...

696
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:40.868
Uri...

697
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.119
Boyka!

698
00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:44.538
Boyka! Boyka!

699
00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.456
Boyka! Boyka!

700
00:53:46.498 --> 00:53:50.460
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

701
00:53:53.379 --> 00:53:55.131
Boyka! Boyka!

702
00:53:59.051 --> 00:54:01.804
Gentlemen, remember...

703
00:54:01.845 --> 00:54:06.391
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

704
00:54:06.433 --> 00:54:08.393
I'll beat you at your own game.

705
00:54:08.435 --> 00:54:10.311
Fists only.

706
00:54:10.353 --> 00:54:12.438
Just don't bleed on me too much.

707
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.524
Fight!

708
00:54:27.202 --> 00:54:29.454
Boyka! Boyka!

709
00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:31.706
Uh! Uh! Uh!

710
00:54:37.253 --> 00:54:40.214
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

711
00:54:41.715 --> 00:54:43.383
- Unh! Unh!
- Ah!

712
00:54:47.887 --> 00:54:50.557
Kill him! Come on!
Come on! Kill him!

713
00:55:07.113 --> 00:55:10.074
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

714
00:55:10.116 --> 00:55:11.743
Ow!

715
00:55:14.579 --> 00:55:15.871
Mmf! Uh! Uh!

716
00:55:15.913 --> 00:55:16.872
Unh!

717
00:55:16.914 --> 00:55:18.582
Keep your hands up!

718
00:55:18.582 --> 00:55:19.583
Unh!

719
00:55:19.625 --> 00:55:20.667
Ugh!

720
00:55:26.631 --> 00:55:28.341
Ugh!

721
00:55:29.467 --> 00:55:30.426
Unh!

722
00:55:31.886 --> 00:55:32.970
Ugh!

723
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:39.852
Oh!

724
00:55:42.437 --> 00:55:43.480
One!

725
00:55:43.522 --> 00:55:46.399
Two!

726
00:55:46.441 --> 00:55:49.110
Three!

727
00:55:49.152 --> 00:55:50.570
Four!

728
00:55:50.612 --> 00:55:52.280
Argh!

729
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:53.281
Hey!

730
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.837
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

731
00:56:08.878 --> 00:56:11.130
Boyka! Boyka!

732
00:56:14.842 --> 00:56:15.801
Argh!

733
00:56:15.843 --> 00:56:16.927
Boyka! Boyka!

734
00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:19.763
Yaah! Yaah! Yaah!

735
00:56:19.805 --> 00:56:21.640
- Ugh!
- Argh!

736
00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.433
- Unh!
- Yah!

737
00:56:27.854 --> 00:56:29.230
Ow!

738
00:56:36.153 --> 00:56:37.613
Yaah! Ugh! Ugh!

739
00:56:40.074 --> 00:56:41.241
Argh!

740
00:57:00.843 --> 00:57:02.010
Ugh!

741
00:57:11.269 --> 00:57:13.062
Towel.

742
00:57:16.857 --> 00:57:18.192
Bucket.

743
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.404
Water.

744
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:24.990
Come on, Stevie!

745
00:57:32.622 --> 00:57:33.790
Argh!

746
00:57:47.719 --> 00:57:49.304
Boyka! Boyka!

747
00:57:51.764 --> 00:57:53.850
Fight!

748
00:57:56.936 --> 00:57:58.521
- Unh!
- Yaah!

749
00:58:03.859 --> 00:58:05.485
Ugh!

750
00:58:05.527 --> 00:58:07.028
Boyka! Boyka!

751
00:58:09.614 --> 00:58:10.573
Unh!

752
00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:11.574
Ugh, uh!

753
00:58:11.658 --> 00:58:12.575
Ow!

754
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.583
Ugh!

755
00:58:21.583 --> 00:58:22.543
Uh!

756
00:58:22.584 --> 00:58:25.045
Boyka! Boyka!

757
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:30.300
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

758
00:58:37.306 --> 00:58:40.642
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

759
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:51.486
Uh!

760
00:59:05.499 --> 00:59:06.625
Ugh!

761
00:59:14.215 --> 00:59:15.174
What happened?

762
00:59:17.593 --> 00:59:19.303
You were drugged.

763
00:59:21.972 --> 00:59:23.098
Stevie.

764
00:59:24.266 --> 00:59:26.393
That motherfucker!

765
00:59:38.654 --> 00:59:40.572
That's your ass, Stevie.

766
00:59:40.614 --> 00:59:42.324
You son of a bitch!

767
01:00:02.509 --> 01:00:04.344
Stevie!

768
01:00:13.352 --> 01:00:15.313
Oh... Ugh.

769
01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:16.814
Man!

770
01:00:24.196 --> 01:00:26.031
Goddamn it, Stevie.

771
01:00:33.162 --> 01:00:34.413
You fuckin' pussy, get up!

772
01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:39.376
I am pussy?

773
01:00:39.418 --> 01:00:40.377
Ha ha ha!

774
01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:42.504
I am pussy?
Look at your face!

775
01:00:42.588 --> 01:00:44.381
You are a fuckin' pussy.

776
01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:46.716
That fight was bullshit
and you know it.

777
01:00:46.758 --> 01:00:48.927
You had Stevie drug me,
and that's how you won.

778
01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:58.519
I am the best fighter
in the world.

779
01:00:58.561 --> 01:01:01.522
I do not need your junkie
friend to help me win.

780
01:01:01.605 --> 01:01:04.399
Can you believe
this fuckin' American?

781
01:01:04.441 --> 01:01:07.819
You drug your opponents and
you call yourself a fighter?

782
01:01:07.861 --> 01:01:09.863
I do not know what
you're talking about.

783
01:01:09.904 --> 01:01:11.823
You make big excuse
because you lose!

784
01:01:12.865 --> 01:01:14.867
You should be happy
I did not finish you.

785
01:01:14.909 --> 01:01:17.953
You guys can't get
enough of each other.

786
01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:26.586
Move over back to your cell.

787
01:01:26.628 --> 01:01:28.922
Man, fuck you!
You said I'd get out.

788
01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:32.008
I know nothing about
this arrangement, George,

789
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:34.343
but surely, I'll look into it.

790
01:01:35.385 --> 01:01:37.303
You lying mother--!

791
01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:38.346
Ow!

792
01:01:39.722 --> 01:01:42.141
You told me I was gonna
get out of here! Get off me! Get off!

793
01:01:42.183 --> 01:01:43.184
To the pole!

794
01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.775
Ugh! I'm gonna
have your ass, punk!

795
01:01:51.817 --> 01:01:53.360
I'm gonna have
your ass, punk!

796
01:01:53.402 --> 01:01:56.529
Wait till I get outta here!
Yeah, you, punk! You!

797
01:01:56.281 --> 01:01:58.241
Markov!
You motherfuck--!

798
01:01:58.324 --> 01:02:00.952
You understand
what I'm--unh!

799
01:02:00.993 --> 01:02:01.952
You--! Unh!

800
01:02:01.994 --> 01:02:02.953
Ow!

801
01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:04.496
Ow! Ugh!

802
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:07.916
There's a rumor.

803
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.670
The American was given a bottle
of water with something in it.

804
01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:14.964
I'm told you know
something about it.

805
01:02:16.674 --> 01:02:19.302
Boyka... no.

806
01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.262
Is it true?

807
01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.473
Answer him.

808
01:02:24.473 --> 01:02:26.141
But--

809
01:02:27.267 --> 01:02:28.977
Look at this!

810
01:02:29.019 --> 01:02:30.103
Look!

811
01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.522
Egyptians!

812
01:02:32.564 --> 01:02:35.400
Greeks! Asians!
American boxers!

813
01:02:35.483 --> 01:02:38.069
All made fighting
into a science.

814
01:02:38.152 --> 01:02:39.487
Ugh!

815
01:02:39.487 --> 01:02:41.989
I am the next stage.

816
01:02:42.073 --> 01:02:43.365
And you think I need you...

817
01:02:43.407 --> 01:02:46.368
to drug my opponents?

818
01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:05.636
Wipe this fuckin' trash
off my floor.

819
01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:25.070
Listen.

820
01:03:25.112 --> 01:03:28.031
I was wondering when you're
planning on releasing him.

821
01:03:28.073 --> 01:03:30.951
I mean, since the deal is done.

822
01:03:34.871 --> 01:03:36.080
Since when did you start...

823
01:03:36.122 --> 01:03:38.041
caring about Mr. Chambers, Phil?

824
01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:39.959
Well, it's not that.

825
01:03:40.001 --> 01:03:42.711
It's just, people are
starting to ask questions.

826
01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.213
Questions.

827
01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:46.048
What do you want, Phil?

828
01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:49.176
Well, given the, uh...

829
01:03:49.217 --> 01:03:53.179
unexpected hassles,
the delays...

830
01:03:53.221 --> 01:03:54.597
I'd like another 250.

831
01:03:54.639 --> 01:03:57.392
Ah, ok. 250 it is.

832
01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.810
Oh! That's great.

833
01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:03.230
240. 250,000.

834
01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:04.356
Thank you.

835
01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:10.028
I guess this is good-bye, then.

836
01:04:11.071 --> 01:04:12.739
Have a nice trip, Mr. Gold.

837
01:04:12.739 --> 01:04:13.948
Thank you.

838
01:04:26.668 --> 01:04:28.212
Oh!

839
01:05:38.568 --> 01:05:39.652
Now what?

840
01:05:42.988 --> 01:05:44.740
What the hell
you looking at?

841
01:07:21.746 --> 01:07:24.331
It has been brought
to my attention...

842
01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:27.334
that a few of you
have been interfering...

843
01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.087
with the punishment
of inmate Chambers.

844
01:07:30.128 --> 01:07:32.130
All those responsible...

845
01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:35.592
identify themselves now
by raising their hands.

846
01:07:48.937 --> 01:07:50.021
Step forward!

847
01:07:54.943 --> 01:07:56.486
Anyone else?

848
01:08:02.158 --> 01:08:03.242
Ah-ha.

849
01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.037
I see.

850
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:26.638
Very cute.

851
01:08:26.638 --> 01:08:28.640
So now you'll stand out here...

852
01:08:28.682 --> 01:08:31.184
in the fucking cold
and think about it!

853
01:08:50.285 --> 01:08:52.162
Shut up. I told you
to do nothing...

854
01:08:52.203 --> 01:08:53.663
nothing without asking me first.

855
01:08:54.914 --> 01:08:56.082
Shut the fuck up!

856
01:08:56.124 --> 01:08:57.291
If anything happens to him...

857
01:08:57.333 --> 01:08:59.252
I will strip you naked...

858
01:08:59.293 --> 01:09:01.253
and hang you by the balls
from the watchtower.

859
01:09:01.295 --> 01:09:02.505
- Heh.
- Open the door.

860
01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:04.298
- Gaga--
- Now, Vlad!

861
01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:10.846
It was never meant
you'd be put out...

862
01:09:10.887 --> 01:09:13.306
in the cold like that,
Mr. Chambers. I apologize.

863
01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:17.143
We had a deal.
I fight, I go free.

864
01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:19.812
No, the deal was...

865
01:09:19.896 --> 01:09:22.273
you win, you go free.

866
01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:25.484
I was drugged and you know it.

867
01:09:25.484 --> 01:09:28.237
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

868
01:09:30.322 --> 01:09:32.866
Maybe next time you fight Boyka...

869
01:09:32.866 --> 01:09:35.910
you should pick
a better cornerman.

870
01:09:35.952 --> 01:09:37.203
Fuck you!

871
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:40.539
There ain't gonna be
a next time.

872
01:09:40.539 --> 01:09:43.667
Listen to me, George.
It's very simple.

873
01:09:47.212 --> 01:09:51.633
I make my money.
You make your exit.

874
01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:55.470
Fuck you!

875
01:09:57.221 --> 01:09:58.514
Fuck me?

876
01:10:00.349 --> 01:10:01.642
As you wish.

877
01:10:04.353 --> 01:10:06.313
Enjoy the rest
of your stay here...

878
01:10:06.355 --> 01:10:07.356
Mr. Chambers.

879
01:10:13.236 --> 01:10:14.237
Hold on.

880
01:10:18.282 --> 01:10:20.326
No drugs.

881
01:10:20.368 --> 01:10:23.746
Not me, not Boyka.

882
01:10:23.787 --> 01:10:25.998
We fight straight up.

883
01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:28.125
Of course.

884
01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:29.459
Look, George...

885
01:10:29.501 --> 01:10:32.295
keeping you here any longer
is a bit of a hassle for me.

886
01:10:32.337 --> 01:10:34.881
You're, uh, too visible.

887
01:10:34.923 --> 01:10:37.884
All I want is one more fight.

888
01:10:37.884 --> 01:10:39.385
One.

889
01:10:40.386 --> 01:10:41.679
And Phil?

890
01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:43.305
Heh.

891
01:10:43.347 --> 01:10:44.932
You don't have
to worry about Phil.

892
01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:48.227
Where he is, money... heh...

893
01:10:48.268 --> 01:10:50.604
Money is not a factor.

894
01:10:53.982 --> 01:10:57.151
Anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Chambers?

895
01:11:01.989 --> 01:11:03.240
Yeah.

896
01:11:04.366 --> 01:11:06.994
I'm gonna need one
more thing from you.

897
01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.641
George?

898
01:12:20.311 --> 01:12:22.730
You know where
this coat come from?

899
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.401
'Cause I hear it come from...

900
01:12:27.484 --> 01:12:31.947
selfish asshole who never
does anything for anyone else.

901
01:12:31.988 --> 01:12:34.491
Why?

902
01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:36.492
Why you think?

903
01:12:36.534 --> 01:12:38.202
It's cold as a motherfucker
around here.

904
01:12:39.662 --> 01:12:42.373
You know, George,
I saw first fight.

905
01:12:42.415 --> 01:12:45.084
I saw something
in first round.

906
01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:47.419
Something
in your eyes.

907
01:12:47.461 --> 01:12:50.172
Before you started
to look drunk.

908
01:12:50.172 --> 01:12:52.424
Ok, Crot,
what did you see?

909
01:12:53.425 --> 01:12:55.176
What did you see, George?

910
01:12:57.679 --> 01:12:59.639
Tsk.

911
01:12:59.722 --> 01:13:01.223
OK.

912
01:13:01.265 --> 01:13:04.059
Maybe I underestimated
the guy a little bit.

913
01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:05.853
But I know how he fights now.

914
01:13:05.853 --> 01:13:08.563
And that same stuff ain't
gonna work on me a second time.

915
01:13:08.563 --> 01:13:09.856
I'm gonna figure somethin' out.

916
01:13:09.898 --> 01:13:12.942
Maybe... you need a little help.

917
01:13:14.152 --> 01:13:15.111
Oh, you gonna help me?

918
01:13:17.238 --> 01:13:19.907
I'm no fighter, George.

919
01:13:19.949 --> 01:13:22.785
But I was once trained
how to hurt people.

920
01:13:22.827 --> 01:13:25.162
I know a thing or two
about grappling...

921
01:13:25.204 --> 01:13:26.872
military close combat.

922
01:13:26.914 --> 01:13:29.791
Things you might need
in this type of fight.

923
01:13:31.168 --> 01:13:34.170
You know what, Crot?
Thanks, but I'm OK.

924
01:13:34.546 --> 01:13:35.672
Hey, this is all
street fighting anyway,

925
01:13:35.713 --> 01:13:37.090
and that's what I'm from.

926
01:13:37.131 --> 01:13:38.966
I'll just go home on his ass.

927
01:13:39.008 --> 01:13:42.887
Besides, all that kickboxing
and grappling stuff...

928
01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.555
- it's overrated.
- Aah!

929
01:13:49.059 --> 01:13:50.811
Aaah!

930
01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.705
Beat me at my own game, huh?

931
01:14:12.956 --> 01:14:15.917
I'm gonna beat you at yours.

932
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.752
Hmm.

933
01:14:17.835 --> 01:14:19.378
Now listen, George.

934
01:14:19.462 --> 01:14:21.547
Man is like pyramid...

935
01:14:21.589 --> 01:14:24.091
but upside down.

936
01:14:24.174 --> 01:14:28.303
You cut his legs--
Finish.

937
01:14:28.345 --> 01:14:31.973
OK.
How do we... begin?

938
01:14:35.393 --> 01:14:37.020
Now get on top of me.

939
01:14:37.061 --> 01:14:39.147
Sorry, man, I'm just
not attracted to you.

940
01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:41.565
Maybe it's the beard.

941
01:14:42.775 --> 01:14:45.444
You want to train
or you want to joke?

942
01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:02.835
Unh!

943
01:15:02.877 --> 01:15:04.545
So this is a basic arm lock.

944
01:15:05.754 --> 01:15:08.257
When you punch, I grab.

945
01:15:08.298 --> 01:15:11.134
I wrap arm.

946
01:15:11.134 --> 01:15:13.595
Put pressure, you see?

947
01:15:16.639 --> 01:15:19.767
You know the old man
is training the American?

948
01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:22.770
Is that supposed to scare me?

949
01:15:22.812 --> 01:15:25.522
He can learn any fucking
thing he wants.

950
01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:26.815
Yaah!

951
01:15:28.317 --> 01:15:30.652
He's still not going
to leave that ring alive.

952
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:41.954
Argh!

953
01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.043
Argh!

954
01:16:15.318 --> 01:16:16.819
Hey, man, sorry. Uh--

955
01:16:16.861 --> 01:16:18.613
No, it's OK.

956
01:16:27.287 --> 01:16:28.997
Potato vodka.

957
01:16:39.507 --> 01:16:41.592
I make it in my toilet.

958
01:16:42.885 --> 01:16:44.553
No, man, I'm gonna pass.

959
01:16:46.513 --> 01:16:48.473
Of course, you are in training.

960
01:16:51.017 --> 01:16:53.144
So what's up
with the photograph?

961
01:17:03.696 --> 01:17:05.614
She's beautiful, isn't she?

962
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.950
Who is she?

963
01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:10.452
My niece.

964
01:17:10.494 --> 01:17:12.329
She's almost nineteen, now.

965
01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.122
She ever visit you here?

966
01:17:14.164 --> 01:17:15.665
No.

967
01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:18.292
Never.

968
01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:19.335
Why not?

969
01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:23.714
She doesn't know that I'm here...

970
01:17:23.756 --> 01:17:25.257
that I exist.

971
01:17:25.299 --> 01:17:28.302
I never want her
to come to this place.

972
01:17:31.596 --> 01:17:34.349
Hey, I was just wondering...

973
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:35.725
what happened?

974
01:17:35.767 --> 01:17:37.477
How did you get yourself
in this place?

975
01:17:40.438 --> 01:17:42.773
When I was in the army...

976
01:17:42.857 --> 01:17:44.984
my younger brother...

977
01:17:45.025 --> 01:17:49.112
he robbed party headquarters
near our house.

978
01:17:49.154 --> 01:17:52.407
It happened when
I was home on leave.

979
01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:57.078
He come home one day...

980
01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.580
and I see it in his eyes.

981
01:17:59.622 --> 01:18:03.209
He tells me he just
made a big mistake.

982
01:18:04.209 --> 01:18:06.420
- Your brother?
- Yes.

983
01:18:06.462 --> 01:18:09.047
Well, why the hell isn't
he here instead of you?

984
01:18:09.089 --> 01:18:11.341
Victor was brilliant.

985
01:18:11.424 --> 01:18:13.468
He had a future...

986
01:18:13.551 --> 01:18:15.595
And a wife.

987
01:18:15.637 --> 01:18:17.263
A pregnant wife.

988
01:18:18.973 --> 01:18:19.932
Me?

989
01:18:21.767 --> 01:18:24.520
I was only a trained
killer for Brezhnev.

990
01:18:26.396 --> 01:18:27.898
So...

991
01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.358
you basically traded
your life for his.

992
01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.401
No, no.

993
01:18:31.443 --> 01:18:33.862
I-I was given only four
years for the robbery.

994
01:18:33.903 --> 01:18:36.489
But when I got here they
tried to drive me crazy.

995
01:18:36.572 --> 01:18:38.866
So finally, I decided to escape.

996
01:18:38.908 --> 01:18:40.451
I tried twice, actually.

997
01:18:40.493 --> 01:18:42.119
The second time
there was a fight.

998
01:18:42.161 --> 01:18:43.662
A guard got killed.

999
01:18:45.122 --> 01:18:47.082
I was also shot, paralyzed.

1000
01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:49.918
They put me here in solitary.

1001
01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.920
Soviet style.

1002
01:18:51.962 --> 01:18:54.380
You see, George?

1003
01:18:54.422 --> 01:18:56.841
I accepted my reality.

1004
01:18:58.843 --> 01:19:01.679
This is where I belong.

1005
01:19:01.679 --> 01:19:04.640
And this is where I will die.

1006
01:19:06.683 --> 01:19:08.685
I don't get it, Crot.

1007
01:19:10.145 --> 01:19:11.354
It's Nikolai.

1008
01:19:11.354 --> 01:19:12.856
Huh?

1009
01:19:12.856 --> 01:19:17.276
My name, it's Nikolai.

1010
01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:19.278
And I know you don't get it.

1011
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:27.870
Argh!

1012
01:19:31.122 --> 01:19:32.624
Ugh!

1013
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:43.050
Ow!

1014
01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:44.385
Ugh!

1015
01:19:47.221 --> 01:19:48.472
- Ow!
- Argh!

1016
01:19:50.098 --> 01:19:51.474
Argh!

1017
01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.979
Now on top of shoulder.

1018
01:19:57.105 --> 01:19:58.606
Lock with head.

1019
01:19:59.649 --> 01:20:01.859
Now press on top of knee.

1020
01:20:04.153 --> 01:20:05.195
Press, George.

1021
01:20:05.237 --> 01:20:06.822
Harder!

1022
01:20:06.864 --> 01:20:08.573
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

1023
01:20:08.615 --> 01:20:10.659
Good, maybe I start
to feel the leg again.

1024
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:19.375
Boyka.

1025
01:20:22.378 --> 01:20:23.754
Boyka.

1026
01:20:23.796 --> 01:20:24.713
Chambers.

1027
01:20:25.756 --> 01:20:27.508
Chambers.

1028
01:20:31.303 --> 01:20:33.054
Boyka.

1029
01:20:33.096 --> 01:20:34.305
Chambers.

1030
01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:36.266
Chambers.

1031
01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:48.277
You are trippin'.

1032
01:20:51.321 --> 01:20:54.074
Tonight, I settle it forever.

1033
01:20:55.074 --> 01:20:57.660
I beat this man again...

1034
01:20:57.744 --> 01:21:00.246
then there is no question.

1035
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.834
I'm the most complete
fighter in the world.

1036
01:21:05.876 --> 01:21:08.086
Remember, George...

1037
01:21:08.128 --> 01:21:09.796
when fight is over...

1038
01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.965
you need to leave fast.
Don't look back.

1039
01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:15.718
Listen...

1040
01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.220
Nikolai, l, uh...

1041
01:21:18.971 --> 01:21:21.807
- I'm glad that--
- No, shut up.

1042
01:21:21.807 --> 01:21:23.642
Stay mean for fight.

1043
01:21:28.939 --> 01:21:30.273
Yeah, you're right.

1044
01:21:33.401 --> 01:21:34.611
I'll see you later.

1045
01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:35.862
George...

1046
01:21:42.284 --> 01:21:43.702
I'm glad, too.

1047
01:21:49.499 --> 01:21:52.919
Once again, please welcome...

1048
01:21:52.961 --> 01:21:58.049
former Heavyweight Boxing
Champion of the World...

1049
01:21:58.091 --> 01:21:59.091
George...

1050
01:21:59.133 --> 01:22:01.719
Iceman Chambeeers!

1051
01:22:04.221 --> 01:22:05.889
Chambers! Chambers!

1052
01:22:05.973 --> 01:22:08.016
And now, let's welcome...

1053
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:13.021
our own undefeated
Heavyweight Champion...

1054
01:22:13.104 --> 01:22:15.815
Uri Boykaaaaa!

1055
01:22:16.858 --> 01:22:18.734
Boyka! Boyka!

1056
01:22:18.776 --> 01:22:19.735
Boyka! Boyka!

1057
01:22:19.777 --> 01:22:22.655
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1058
01:22:22.655 --> 01:22:24.740
- Boyka! Boyka!
- Chambers!

1059
01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:39.837
Boyka! Boyka!

1060
01:22:42.882 --> 01:22:44.383
Fight!

1061
01:22:44.466 --> 01:22:45.426
Unh!

1062
01:22:46.468 --> 01:22:47.427
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

1063
01:22:54.392 --> 01:22:55.685
Unh! Unh! Unh!

1064
01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:02.191
Argh! Unh!

1065
01:23:04.401 --> 01:23:05.486
Ugh!

1066
01:23:05.527 --> 01:23:06.737
Argh!

1067
01:23:06.778 --> 01:23:07.779
Yeah!

1068
01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:08.822
Unh!

1069
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.117
- Argh!
- Unh!

1070
01:23:12.158 --> 01:23:14.577
Argh!

1071
01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:17.914
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

1072
01:23:18.956 --> 01:23:20.291
Argh!

1073
01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.084
Ugh!

1074
01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:24.169
Move in!

1075
01:23:24.211 --> 01:23:26.588
Boyka! Boyka!

1076
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:27.798
- Argh!
- Yah!

1077
01:23:27.839 --> 01:23:28.840
Ugh!

1078
01:23:30.926 --> 01:23:32.802
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

1079
01:23:35.513 --> 01:23:37.015
Argh!

1080
01:23:37.056 --> 01:23:38.015
Ow!

1081
01:23:43.979 --> 01:23:46.440
Stop! Round's over!

1082
01:23:51.278 --> 01:23:52.779
Not bad for first round, George.

1083
01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:54.656
But why you don't
use your new technique?

1084
01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:56.032
I'm working on it.

1085
01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:59.368
Boyka, make him wait.

1086
01:23:59.410 --> 01:24:02.413
Remember, take his leg.

1087
01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:07.501
Fight!

1088
01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.088
Unh!

1089
01:24:14.924 --> 01:24:15.967
Argh!

1090
01:24:18.094 --> 01:24:19.929
Unh! Uh!

1091
01:24:22.473 --> 01:24:23.974
Unh! Ugh!

1092
01:24:25.517 --> 01:24:26.768
Arrrgh!

1093
01:24:30.814 --> 01:24:31.773
Ugh! Unh!

1094
01:24:31.815 --> 01:24:33.983
- Argh!
- Ow!

1095
01:24:34.025 --> 01:24:35.568
Ugh!

1096
01:24:37.153 --> 01:24:39.614
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

1097
01:24:39.655 --> 01:24:41.407
Boyka! Boyka!

1098
01:24:41.449 --> 01:24:42.783
Unh!

1099
01:24:44.285 --> 01:24:45.369
Ow!

1100
01:24:46.829 --> 01:24:48.413
Arrrgh!

1101
01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:53.293
Argh!

1102
01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:56.754
Argh!

1103
01:24:56.796 --> 01:24:58.089
Argh!

1104
01:24:58.131 --> 01:24:59.090
Take him!

1105
01:25:05.304 --> 01:25:06.638
Argh!

1106
01:25:17.315 --> 01:25:19.108
Listen to me, George.

1107
01:25:19.108 --> 01:25:20.276
You must finish him...

1108
01:25:20.318 --> 01:25:22.069
or you will rot in
this stinking hole...

1109
01:25:22.153 --> 01:25:23.612
for the rest of your life.

1110
01:25:23.696 --> 01:25:25.823
Like me!

1111
01:25:27.032 --> 01:25:28.950
- Go!
- Ugh!

1112
01:25:30.785 --> 01:25:32.704
I am the champion.

1113
01:25:34.164 --> 01:25:36.624
They will never let you
out of here.

1114
01:25:36.666 --> 01:25:39.877
Do you understand me, George?

1115
01:25:39.919 --> 01:25:41.087
What are you waiting for?

1116
01:25:41.128 --> 01:25:42.463
The bell.

1117
01:25:44.465 --> 01:25:45.758
Argh!

1118
01:25:49.261 --> 01:25:50.262
Ow!

1119
01:25:51.304 --> 01:25:52.305
Yaaah!

1120
01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:06.527
Ow!

1121
01:26:23.876 --> 01:26:25.586
Chambers! Chambers!

1122
01:26:33.218 --> 01:26:35.762
Unh!

1123
01:26:35.845 --> 01:26:37.472
Argh!
Argh!

1124
01:26:38.097 --> 01:26:39.390
Now on top of shoulder.

1125
01:26:39.432 --> 01:26:40.391
Argh!

1126
01:26:40.433 --> 01:26:41.392
Lock with head.

1127
01:26:41.434 --> 01:26:42.393
Argh!

1128
01:26:42.435 --> 01:26:44.353
Argh!

1129
01:26:44.395 --> 01:26:45.479
Press harder!

1130
01:26:46.772 --> 01:26:47.856
Fuck you!

1131
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:50.192
Argh!

1132
01:26:51.693 --> 01:26:52.819
Press, George.

1133
01:26:54.237 --> 01:26:55.238
Harder.

1134
01:26:56.531 --> 01:26:57.740
Ugh!

1135
01:26:57.782 --> 01:26:58.950
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

1136
01:27:00.826 --> 01:27:02.078
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

1137
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:04.747
Aaaah!

1138
01:27:04.747 --> 01:27:06.331
- Yes!
- Aaah!

1139
01:27:06.373 --> 01:27:09.001
Aaah!

1140
01:27:09.084 --> 01:27:10.335
Aaaargh!

1141
01:27:10.377 --> 01:27:11.419
Argh!

1142
01:27:11.503 --> 01:27:13.046
Aah!

1143
01:27:19.093 --> 01:27:20.553
Don't touch me!

1144
01:27:24.556 --> 01:27:30.729
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1145
01:27:30.729 --> 01:27:33.440
Chambers! Chambers!

1146
01:27:36.067 --> 01:27:38.569
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1147
01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:41.072
Chambers! Chambers!

1148
01:27:41.113 --> 01:27:42.865
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

1149
01:27:42.907 --> 01:27:46.118
Chambers! Chambers!
Chambers! Chambers!

1150
01:27:48.537 --> 01:27:50.163
Chambers! Chambers!

1151
01:27:50.247 --> 01:27:52.374
You made a fortune.

1152
01:27:52.415 --> 01:27:56.794
Yeah. I had a feeling
our luck would change.

1153
01:27:56.794 --> 01:27:57.920
Hmm?

1154
01:28:03.551 --> 01:28:05.177
Chambers! Chambers!

1155
01:28:22.443 --> 01:28:24.820
Congratulations, Mr. Chambers.

1156
01:28:26.947 --> 01:28:28.490
I'm outta here, right?

1157
01:28:30.909 --> 01:28:32.494
Yes, you are.

1158
01:28:35.455 --> 01:28:36.664
One moment.

1159
01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:41.043
What's this?

1160
01:28:42.670 --> 01:28:43.754
Your cut.

1161
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.175
Listen, George,
it was never my intention...

1162
01:28:48.216 --> 01:28:50.177
to make your stay here
so unpleasant.

1163
01:28:50.218 --> 01:28:53.138
I'm sorry for that.
One more moment.

1164
01:28:53.179 --> 01:28:55.974
Do you mind if we take
a photo together, me and you?

1165
01:28:56.015 --> 01:28:58.768
Not for me. My nephew.

1166
01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:00.645
Big fan of yours.

1167
01:29:00.686 --> 01:29:03.022
Let me tell you something.

1168
01:29:03.022 --> 01:29:05.733
I'm not gonna forget
what you did to me.

1169
01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:07.401
Ever.

1170
01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:09.277
And I will see you again.

1171
01:29:09.319 --> 01:29:11.488
That's my word.

1172
01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:13.281
But right now...

1173
01:29:13.323 --> 01:29:15.283
I'd like to get
the hell out of here.

1174
01:29:15.325 --> 01:29:16.826
Sure.

1175
01:29:27.878 --> 01:29:29.171
One moment.

1176
01:29:33.216 --> 01:29:35.051
Where the fuck is he going now?

1177
01:29:39.805 --> 01:29:42.057
I wouldn't try anything
stupid, Mr. Chambers.

1178
01:29:42.057 --> 01:29:43.392
There are guards outside.

1179
01:29:43.392 --> 01:29:46.395
Relax, I just need to talk
to you about something.

1180
01:29:46.395 --> 01:29:48.021
What?

1181
01:29:53.276 --> 01:29:54.819
I wanna make a deal.

1182
01:30:03.869 --> 01:30:05.788
Came to say good-bye, huh?

1183
01:30:08.206 --> 01:30:09.207
Yeah.

1184
01:30:11.918 --> 01:30:13.503
You did well.

1185
01:30:15.046 --> 01:30:18.049
I did all right.

1186
01:30:18.091 --> 01:30:20.051
Do you still have
that jacket I got you?

1187
01:30:20.092 --> 01:30:21.594
Of course.

1188
01:30:24.763 --> 01:30:27.140
I will hold on to it forever.

1189
01:30:27.182 --> 01:30:29.226
Well, now that's up to you...

1190
01:30:29.267 --> 01:30:31.561
but you better grab it
and put it on right now.

1191
01:30:32.562 --> 01:30:33.521
Why?

1192
01:30:34.731 --> 01:30:36.858
Because, Nikolai...

1193
01:30:36.899 --> 01:30:39.986
there's an 18-year-old girl
who needs to meet her uncle.

1194
01:30:40.027 --> 01:30:42.238
And it's cold as
a motherfucker out there.

1195
01:31:01.714 --> 01:31:04.216
I don't know about this, George.

1196
01:31:06.552 --> 01:31:08.262
It's all right, Nikolai.

1197
01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:10.639
You got a lot of time
to let it sink in now.

1198
01:31:20.314 --> 01:31:23.526
I'm telling you, George,
it's a mistake.

1199
01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:25.110
No, it ain't.

1200
01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:19.577
No, I can't.

1201
01:32:19.619 --> 01:32:22.121
Ah! Yes, you can.

1202
01:32:22.163 --> 01:32:23.330
No, I can't.

1203
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:25.749
- Go.
- Oh, George.
