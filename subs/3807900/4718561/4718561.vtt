Yes, but if you win, then what?

571
00:54:57.545 --> 00:55:01.299
Are you ready to lead?
To make hard decisions?

572
00:55:04.302 --> 00:55:09.349
The Sprawl is self-sustaining,
but it wasn't always this way.

573
00:55:09.432 --> 00:55:12.227
When I arrived, it was a wasteland.

574
00:55:12.894 --> 00:55:15.063
The Weyland corporation promoted The Sprawl

575
00:55:15.146 --> 00:55:17.315
as an alternative to regular prison.

576
00:55:17.398 --> 00:55:20.151
That was a lie.

577
00:55:20.235 --> 00:55:24.072
The Sprawl was created as
an alternative to the death penalty.

578
00:55:24.906 --> 00:55:29.160
They throw us cheese,
and expect us to act like rats.

579
00:55:29.244 --> 00:55:33.122
They didn't expect us to evolve,

580
00:55:33.206 --> 00:55:36.417
but we are, and we will.

581
00:55:37.252 --> 00:55:40.588
I keep this place from anarchy.

582
00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:43.091
What does this have to do with a street race?

583
00:55:43.424 --> 00:55:48.263
It's not just a street race,
it is who we are.

585
00:55:54.352 --> 00:55:56.104
Nobody special.

586
00:55:56.187 --> 00:56:00.024
All that could change if you win
Death Race, if you defeat me.

587
00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:03.778
Why would you be willing
to risk losing all this power?

588
00:56:04.279 --> 00:56:07.448
Death Race gives anyone
the opportunity to become king.

589
00:56:08.116 --> 00:56:11.035
Without that to inspire, we're nothing.

590

your first act as king?

591
00:56:17.041 --> 00:56:18.585
Haven't really thought about it.

592
00:56:19.335 --> 00:56:22.505
I won because I knew exactly
what I wanted to do

593
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:24.257
when I was king of this hill.

594
00:56:24.966 --> 00:56:27.886
If you don't know what you want,
you'll die on the track,

596
00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:32.432
