00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.503
(drumroll)

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.341
(rousing orchestral fanfare playing)

3
00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:21.312
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.316
(wind gusting)

5
00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.325
(wind whistling)

6
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.174
(thunder rumbles in distance)

7
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:56.848
(thunder cracks)

8
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.565
(thunder crackling, rumbling)

9
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.862
(thunder fades)

10
00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.379
(low rumbling, getting louder)

11
00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:58.243
(crackling, rumbling)

12
00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.935
(resolute sigh)

13
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.376
Zeus.

14
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.757
Poseidon.

15
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.385
It's been many years.

16
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.266
What do you see?

17
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:08.813
Thunderclouds.

18
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.109
But no lightning.

19
00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:16.738
Stolen.

20
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.367
What?

21
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:22.911
You think I took it?

22
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.915
Omnipotence has
blinded you, brother.

23
00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.626
We are forbidden from
stealing each other's powers.

24
00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.379
But our children aren't.

25
00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:36.257
You're accusing my son?

26
00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.969
I haven't seen him
since he was a baby.

27
00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.223
He doesn't know me or even know
who he is because of you.

28
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:45.016
If your son is the thief...

29
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.436
I will send him
to the depths of Tartarus.

30
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.772
If you touch him...

31
00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.733
you will have the fight of your life.

32
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.948
You must return the bolt to me.

33
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.453
In 14 days, by midnight
on the summer solstice.

34
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.337
Or there will be war.

35
00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:40.655
(water sloshing, bubbling)

36
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.564
BOY: And he's alive!
(laughs)

37
00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:58.649
(clapping)

38
00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.902
Percy Jackson is a beast!

39
00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:03.029
You're a beast, man!
Give me some.

40
00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:04.906
(chuckles)

41
00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:05.990
How long was that?

42
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.950
-Seven minutes.
-Seven minutes?

43
00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.243
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh.

44
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:11.579
That's crazy, man.
That's ridiculous.

45
00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:14.665
-How do you do it?
-I just like being in water.

46
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.335
(sighs)
It's the one place I can think.

47
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:18.795
Mm-hmm.

48
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.674
(students chattering)

49
00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.597
(school bell rings)

50
00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:33.810
Wow, wish I could spend all day
underwater instead of this place.

51
00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.604
Right? It's like high school
without the musical.

52
00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:40.233
Every day is the same thing.
Look at this.

53
00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:41.901
(sighs)

54
00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.201
Good morning.

55
00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:53.496
I'm Miss Dodds,
your substitute English teacher.

56
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.582
Would someone please explain
what Shakespeare was trying

57
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.751
to convey in this line from <i>Othello?</i>

58
00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.714
Percy Jackson?

59
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:10.179
MISS DODDS: Well?

60
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.064
I'm sorry. I don't know.

61
00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:23.693
Anybody else?

62
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.492
MAN: Yo, buddy,
you can't park there!

63
00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.455
(laughs)
It was so funny.

64
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.331
That's great.
I didn't even know about it.

65
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.708
MAN 2:
It's not my problem, all right?

66
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.251
Look, there's nothing I can do.

67
00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:43.087
You call them... you call them
and see what the problem is, all right?

68
00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.422
MAN 3: Yeah, yeah...

69
00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:46.090
PERCY:
Hey, Mom, I'm home.

70
00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.550
MOM:
I'm up here, honey.

71
00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.136
Hi.

72
00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.220
Hey, Mom.

73
00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.389
-How was school today?
-The usual.

74
00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:59.020
Think this, uh,
dyslexia thing is getting worse.

75
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.938
Oh, why do you think that?

76
00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:06.027
(sighs) I don't know.
Maybe it's the ADHD.

77
00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.698
You know, I thought this school
was supposed to make things better.

78
00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:13.159
Percy, I know how hard this is for you.

79
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.120
But someday it'll all make sense.

80
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:19.081
Really? When?

81
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.541
Hmm?

82
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.210
Tonight, tomorrow? When?

83
00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.295
(door closes)

84
00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:25.922
Woman!

85
00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:28.883
-Hi, Gabe.
-(Gabe groans)

86
00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.384
Where's my beer?

87
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:32.595
It's in the fridge.

88
00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:37.016
So, what, it's supposed to magically float
from the icebox and into my hand?

89
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:38.518
(chuckles)

90
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:39.936
Hustle. (chuckles)

91
00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.522
Oh, come on, man.
You have to do that right here?

92
00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:45.399
It's disgusting. W-We're in a kitchen.

93
00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.362
Yeah, real charmer you got there.

94
00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:50.488
Really.

95
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.031
Show some respect.

96
00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:53.824
All right?
That's my mom right there.

97
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.744
(grunts)

98
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.794
GABE: This is my house.

99
00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:08.422
You show some respect.

100
00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:10.716
Oh, come on.

101
00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:16.264
Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.

102
00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:19.267
He sleeps till noon every day,
and he can't even hold a job.

103
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.060
Why do you stay with him?

104
00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:27.400
He's been good to us, Percy,
in ways you just... you don't understand.

105
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.278
You're right.

106
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:31.862
I don't understand. I don't get it.

107
00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.623
(sighs heavily)

108
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:48.087
(people conversing indistinctly)

109
00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:02.226
POSEIDON: <i>Be prepared.</i>

110
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.354
<i>Everything is about to change, Percy.</i>

111
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:08.274
<i>Everything is about to change.</i>

112
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:19.452
MR. BRUNNER:
There are 12 Olympian gods.

113
00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:25.958
The Big Three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.

114
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:31.130
They attained power by
overthrowing their father, Cronus,

115
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.174
chopping him into little pieces.

116
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:39.096
The three gods
have been rivals ever since.

117
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.640
Always arguing.

118
00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.933
Always threatening war.

119
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:47.813
On several occasions, they would
come down to Earth and, um...

120
00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:50.900
how shall I put this?

121
00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.276
Hook up?

122
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.111
(laughter)

123
00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:56.530
They would hook up with mortals.

124
00:10:56.614 --> 00:11:01.452
The children of these unions
were half god, half human.

125
00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:05.164
Can anyone tell me
what they were called?

126
00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:06.499
Percy.

127
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.668
(whispering) Percy.

128
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.921
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
What, Mr. Brunner?

129
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:19.136
What is the proper name of
the offspring of a human and a god?

130
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.098
Demigod.

131
00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.307
Exactly.

132
00:11:23.891 --> 00:11:26.560
And many became great heroes,

133
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:30.106
like Hercules and Achilles.

134
00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:34.402
Can you name... another?

135
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:37.947
I'll give you a hint.

136
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.033
You have something in common.

137
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:52.545
Percy.

138
00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:56.424
Perseus?

139
00:11:59.593 --> 00:12:00.803
Correct.

140
00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:04.598
Now, over here, we have a depiction

141
00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:07.852
of Hercules defeating the Nemean lion.

142
00:12:08.853 --> 00:12:12.565
Hercules killed the beast
with his bare hands

143
00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:15.359
and took the skin as a trophy.

144
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.194
Percy.

145
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.155
Yes, Miss Dodds?

146
00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:20.781
We need to talk.

147
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.951
Okay.

148
00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:28.080
BRUNNER: The next 11 labors
would become increasingly difficult.

149
00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.916
It would take Hercules three months...

150
00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.843
So, did I do something wrong?

151
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:44.430
Miss Dodds?

152
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.391
Hello?

153
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.268
MISS DODDS (angrily):
Where is it?

154
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:51.187
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

155
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.398
How... did you get up there?

156
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.025
-(growls)
-Whoa! Whoa!

157
00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:58.486
(shrieking)

158
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.946
(gasping, screams)

159
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.326
-(gasps)
-You stole the lightning bolt.

160
00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:06.786
I don't know
what you're talking about!

161
00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:08.245
Give it to me.

162
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.414
Whoa! Whoa!

163
00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.041
Give it to me.

164
00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:13.709
Now.

165
00:13:13.793 --> 00:13:15.711
Or I will bite your heart out.

166
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.129
Percy!

167
00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.798
(gasping)

168
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:19.799
Release him!

169
00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.592
You.

170
00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:25.471
Release him, or I swear
I'll tear you to pieces.

171
00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:27.306
(shrieking)

172
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.808
Whoa!

173
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.144
(groaning)

174
00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.146
(shrieking)

175
00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:37.566
(gasping)
Oh... oh...!

176
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.360
Whoa, I'm going crazy!

177
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:41.070
Oh... I should be on medication.

178
00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:42.738
-Percy, calm down, okay?
-I should be on medication.

179
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.448
-Everything's going to be okay.
-Oh, God, wait.

180
00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:48.118
Did that really just happen?

181
00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:49.703
She just turned into that thing?

182
00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:54.124
A Fury... concealed in our school.
I should've known.

183
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:57.253
Wait, a Fury? What's a Fury?

184
00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.004
And why did you say
you could tear her to pieces?

185
00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.048
What did she want from you?

186
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:04.301
She... said something...

187
00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:06.136
about me...

188
00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:08.556
stealing a lightning bolt.

189
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.683
They found him.

190
00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:15.312
He's in danger.

191
00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:16.772
-Who found me?
-Shh.

192
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:19.233
-He's no longer secure here.
-Okay, where should we move him?

193
00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:20.734
We have no choice-- to the camp.

194
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:23.279
Huh? What camp?
Look, I'm standing right here.

195
00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.114
If they think he's the thief,

196
00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.324
there's nowhere safe
on Heaven and Earth for him now.

197
00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:30.744
Percy, take this to defend yourself.

198
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:34.540
It's a powerful weapon.
Guard it well.

199
00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:38.419
Only use it in times of severe distress.

200
00:14:40.421 --> 00:14:43.382
This is a pen. This is a pen!

201
00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:46.343
Take him to his mother.
And don't let him out of your sight.

202
00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:47.636
Okay. Percy, come on.

203
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.305
Come on, man. Come on!

204
00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.598
-Are you guys crazy?
-Let's go!

205
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.349
This is a pen, man.

206
00:14:52.433 --> 00:14:54.935
-Can't do anything with this.
-Come on!

207
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:56.395
Look, man, what's going on?

208
00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.189
Shh! Look, don't
trust anyone, okay?

209
00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:01.775
Don't look at anybody.
Just keep walking!

210
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:03.819
Why did Mr. Brunner
ask you to watch me?

211
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:05.029
Because I'm your protector.

212
00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:07.531
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
My protector? Are you kidding?

213
00:15:07.615 --> 00:15:11.076
What? You think because I'm like this,
I'm not capable of keeping you safe?

214
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.121
Maybe you're not seeing
what I'm seeing. You have crutches.

215
00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:16.582
Look, I would give my life
to secure your well-being.

216
00:15:16.665 --> 00:15:18.000
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

217
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.170
We gotta warn your mom.
Come on, Perce.

218
00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.005
Come on!

219
00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.090
Sally!

220
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.842
-PERCY: Mom!
-More beer!

221
00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:30.512
Hey, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
look, we got to talk, okay?

222
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:34.266
Hey! Can't you see she's
servicing me and my friends?

223
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.895
Hey, hey! Don't talk about my mom
like that, you bald-headed freak.

224
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:41.273
-No, Gabe! Gabe!
-Calm down!

225
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.943
(grunting and groaning)

226
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.569
-Oh, God.
-MAN: Whoa!

227
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:46.820
Hey, nice one.

228
00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:48.989
Like I said, I'm your protector.

229
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.700
Yeah.

230
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.911
Sally, Percy has to leave now.

231
00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:55.746
Like, right now.

232
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.671
PERCY:
Look, what is happening?

233
00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:06.298
Okay, I swear I didn't steal anything.

234
00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:09.885
Honey, I believe you. I believe you.

235
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:12.137
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp?

236
00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:14.640
It's a camp for really special people.

237
00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:16.058
Like you.

238
00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:19.103
"Special people"?
What, am I crazy or something?

239
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:20.980
SALLY: No, honey, no.

240
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.983
Percy, this is about your father.

241
00:16:29.238 --> 00:16:30.531
SALLY:
...out of school, and I was working

242
00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.866
at the Jersey Shore when we first met.

243
00:16:35.202 --> 00:16:37.955
Your father was unlike
any guy I'd ever seen.

244
00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:40.207
He was just dazzling.

245
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.584
Well, they're always dazzling.

246
00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.878
We were really in love, Percy.

247
00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:49.091
And then you came along,
and then it was just perfect.

248
00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:51.719
But he had to leave.

249
00:16:53.345 --> 00:16:55.139
So, he did abandon us.

250
00:16:55.723 --> 00:16:59.226
No, honey, he was forced to.
He loved you.

251
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:03.731
Leaving you-- it was probably
the most difficult thing he ever did.

252
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:11.030
(mooing)

253
00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.160
Why did he have to go?

254
00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:18.829
Because he's...

255
00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:20.414
-Sally, watch out!
-PERCY: Whoa!

256
00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:22.666
(tires screech)

257
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.044
(screaming)

258
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.174
(groaning)

259
00:17:30.257 --> 00:17:32.843
-Percy.
-Mom, you all right?

260
00:17:32.926 --> 00:17:34.511
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Grover, you all right?

261
00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.764
(groaning)

262
00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.849
Is it me, or is it raining cows?

263
00:17:38.932 --> 00:17:40.934
(Sally panting)

264
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:43.645
(rumbling)

265
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.564
What is that?

266
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:47.149
SALLY: Get out!

267
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.817
Hurry! Come on!

268
00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:50.611
Why are you taking your pants off?

269
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:52.321
-What are you doing?
-My job.

270
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.698
Whoa! Whoa!
You're half donkey?

271
00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.200
I'm half goat.

272
00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:57.367
(grunting)

273
00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:03.540
(grunting)

274
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:05.542
Guys, watch all this glass.

275
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:07.169
Come on! Get out the car!

276
00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.171
That thing's getting closer!

277
00:18:09.254 --> 00:18:11.924
-You don't even need these.
-Look, man, those are just for show.

278
00:18:12.007 --> 00:18:13.717
-Follow me!
-Whoa!

279
00:18:15.677 --> 00:18:18.472
(grunting)

280
00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:19.807
This way, guys. This way!

281
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.850
Come on! Come on!

282
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.435
Come on! Run!

283
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.645
Run!

284
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.063
(growling)

285
00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:27.314
(panting)

286
00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.149
(roaring)

287
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.359
(gasps)

288
00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.320
(screaming)

289
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.369
Come on! Come on!

290
00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:43.705
(panting)

291
00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.167
We're here! Come on!

292
00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:56.093
(all panting)

293
00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:57.177
-(whooshing)
-(grunting)

294
00:18:57.261 --> 00:18:59.221
Mom, what are you doing?

295
00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.722
This is as far as I can go.

296
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.641
-No. Come on!
-I can't go through.

297
00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.017
I'm not like you.

298
00:19:04.101 --> 00:19:05.686
Look, I'm not leaving without you.

299
00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:08.438
You have to. You're meant to.

300
00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.606
(growling)

301
00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.442
(screaming)

302
00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:14.236
(roaring)

303
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.029
(groaning)

304
00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:17.948
Put my mother down!

305
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:21.451
Percy, go.
You're safe inside the gate.

306
00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.120
-What can I do?
-Listen, use the pen!

307
00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.372
-What?
-Use Brunner's pen and click it.

308
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.167
Whoa!

309
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.626
(screaming)

310
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.170
(whooshing)

311
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.047
(growling)

312
00:19:36.717 --> 00:19:38.677
(grunting)

313
00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:43.432
(groaning)

314
00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:46.852
(panting)

315
00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:49.146
-(Minotaur roars)
-(Percy gasps)

316
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.898
Perce, are you okay?

317
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.357
(growling, huffing)

318
00:19:56.236 --> 00:19:57.571
(panting)

319
00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.281
(growling)

320
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:02.242
(roaring)

321
00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:04.036
Percy, behind you!

322
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.789
(grunting)

323
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.666
(roaring)

324
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.918
(grunts, sighs)

325
00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.754
(howling)

326
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.467
(sighing)

327
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.469
-Perce, you okay?
-I'm not feeling...

328
00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.678
Percy!

329
00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.805
(groans, gasps)

330
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.167
GROVER:
Perce. I'm sure glad you're alive.

331
00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.296
Ow!

332
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.589
Oh.

333
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:06.890
PERCY: Where am I?
What is this place?

334
00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.433
The infirmary.

335
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.519
You've been unconscious
for three days.

336
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:11.645
Three days?

337
00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:17.109
So, uh, Perce, what do you remember?

338
00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:20.862
(scoffs)
Some... crazy dream.

339
00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:23.115
I don't know. There was... a monster.

340
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.408
My mom was there.

341
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:27.744
Well, you were there, too,
but you were some weird hybrid...

342
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:29.955
man-goat thing. Whoa!

343
00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:34.209
Yeah.

344
00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.128
The politically correct term is satyr.

345
00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:38.714
No.

346
00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:42.551
No, no, no, no!

347
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.511
All of it was real?

348
00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:46.138
My mom's gone?

349
00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:48.974
I'm sorry, Percy.

350
00:21:49.057 --> 00:21:50.976
I try, man. I really do.

351
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.646
But, frankly,
I'm just a junior protector.

352
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.106
I don't have my horns yet.

353
00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:59.067
It was my fault.

354
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.445
It was my job to protect you.

355
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:03.363
Both of you.

356
00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:08.452
(heavy sigh)

357
00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:11.038
-(men grunting)
-MAN: Good. Hold your position.

358
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.373
Nice. Up.

359
00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:17.085
So, this is Camp Half Blood.

360
00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:18.587
"Half," meaning what?

361
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.088
I think you know.

362
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:21.965
"Half" meaning
half mortal, half god.

363
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:25.552
-MAN: Fire!
-Whoa! Guys, watch the arrows!

364
00:22:25.635 --> 00:22:27.554
Newcomer. Hello.

365
00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:28.930
Gosh!

366
00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:32.809
Look, man, remember all the myths
about Greek gods and goddesses?

367
00:22:32.893 --> 00:22:34.853
Well, they're not myths.

368
00:22:34.936 --> 00:22:37.147
Look, remember what
Mr. Brunner said?

369
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.941
Sometimes they come down to Earth
and they fall in love with mortals,

370
00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:42.527
and then they have... kids?

371
00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:43.737
No way.

372
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.614
Yes way.

373
00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.866
Yep, you're a demigod!

374
00:22:47.949 --> 00:22:49.826
Two points for Percy Jackson!

375
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.620
(laughs)

376
00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.455
Look, don't worry,
but you're not alone.

377
00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:56.083
There's hundreds in the world.
Some lead normal lives,

378
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.210
and some-- I'm not allowed
to divulge the names--

379
00:22:58.293 --> 00:22:59.836
are very famous.

380
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.006
I'm talking about, like,
White House famous.

381
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.466
See, man, this place right here,

382
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:07.386
this is the place where you learn
to harness your powers.

383
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:10.389
You're trained to become
leaders, warriors, and heroes.

384
00:23:10.472 --> 00:23:12.891
PERCY: I think you have
the wrong guy, all right?

385
00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:14.976
I'm not a hero. I'm a loser.

386
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.229
I have dyslexia, ADHD.

387
00:23:17.312 --> 00:23:20.148
GROVER:
And those are your greatest gifts.

388
00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.651
When you try to read, the words
float off the page, right?

389
00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:26.029
That's because your brain is hardwired
for ancient Greek, not English.

390
00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:29.032
Like... at the museum, I can read.

391
00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.117
Yeah.

392
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.077
And your ADHD...

393
00:23:33.537 --> 00:23:37.040
You're impulsive, Percy.
You can't be still.

394
00:23:37.124 --> 00:23:39.543
Those are your natural
battle reflexes, man.

395
00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:42.087
They kept you alive in your fight.

396
00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:45.882
Look, no pitiful loser
can defeat a Minotaur.

397
00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:48.927
Your blood is special.

398
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.971
It's the blood of a god.

399
00:23:52.055 --> 00:23:53.682
This is a lot to process.

400
00:23:54.182 --> 00:23:56.768
Yeah, a lot, a lot.

401
00:23:57.352 --> 00:24:00.522
(students grunting)

402
00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:02.899
This is where you do most
of your battle training.

403
00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:06.486
(students grunting)

404
00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.082
What's her name?

405
00:24:19.166 --> 00:24:21.334
(laughs)

406
00:24:21.418 --> 00:24:23.545
She will squash you like a bug.

407
00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:25.255
Her name.

408
00:24:25.338 --> 00:24:29.634
Annabeth, daughter
of Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

409
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.223
Hey, no staring.

410
00:24:35.307 --> 00:24:37.309
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.

411
00:24:37.392 --> 00:24:38.685
PERCY:
Uh-huh.

412
00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:44.274
There's someone I want you to see.
Check this out.

413
00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:55.243
-Oh, wow.
-(chuckles)

414
00:24:58.121 --> 00:25:00.040
What are those things?

415
00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:02.751
They're centaurs.
(laughs)

416
00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.878
PERCY:
Wait a minute.

417
00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:06.296
Is that Mr. Brunner?

418
00:25:06.379 --> 00:25:07.547
Come on.

419
00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:11.051
Whoa, w-w-whoa.

420
00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:12.969
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

421
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:14.763
(chuckles)

422
00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:16.598
Mr. Brunner?

423
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:19.935
In my world,
I'm known as Chiron.

424
00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.270
Are you recovered?

425
00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:23.813
Am <i>I </i>recovered?

426
00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:28.193
You, you're not in a wheelchair.
You have...

427
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.403
A real horse's ass.

428
00:25:31.404 --> 00:25:35.158
I apologize for hiding my true form,
but I needed to keep an eye on you.

429
00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:37.494
I hope you'll forgive me.

430
00:25:37.577 --> 00:25:38.578
Come.

431
00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.543
(horse neighs)

432
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.967
(women chatting and laughing)

433
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.678
-Hey, Grover!
-Grover!

434
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:55.929
(overlapping chatter)

435
00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:59.307
Ooh, the daughters of Aphrodite.

436
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.559
Okay, all right, guys.

437
00:26:00.642 --> 00:26:02.185
You guys got a lot of catching up to do.

438
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:05.063
Their mother is the goddess of love,
so you know where that leads.

439
00:26:05.146 --> 00:26:07.774
Hey, baby! Whoo!

440
00:26:07.857 --> 00:26:09.234
Hmph! Satyrs.

441
00:26:09.317 --> 00:26:11.236
-(daughters whooping)
-Whoo! (laughs)

442
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.572
PERCY:
What is this place?

443
00:26:15.073 --> 00:26:16.575
Welcome home.

444
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:20.453
Your father built this... for you.

445
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:23.623
Wow.

446
00:26:31.673 --> 00:26:33.174
This whole place is mine?

447
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.318
This thing's got some weight to it.

448
00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.821
(sighs)

449
00:26:57.824 --> 00:26:59.326
My father is Poseidon.

450
00:26:59.826 --> 00:27:01.703
God of the seas.

451
00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:04.664
Why didn't anybody tell me?

452
00:27:04.748 --> 00:27:06.499
It was for your own safety.

453
00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:12.047
It's exceedingly rare for a child
to be born to one of the Big Three.

454
00:27:15.008 --> 00:27:19.012
You're very powerful... a threat.

455
00:27:19.095 --> 00:27:20.138
A threat?

456
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:21.723
Who am I threatening?

457
00:27:22.766 --> 00:27:24.643
Poseidon's brothers...

458
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.479
Zeus and Hades.

459
00:27:29.522 --> 00:27:32.275
That's why your mother
married your stepfather.

460
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:36.696
His pungent odor masked
the smell of your blood

461
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.992
and hid you from anything or anyone

462
00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:42.827
the gods would send to kill you.

463
00:27:44.537 --> 00:27:47.123
My mother put up
with that creep to protect me?

464
00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:48.416
Mm-hmm.

465
00:27:52.212 --> 00:27:53.922
I wish I had known.

466
00:27:54.923 --> 00:27:57.384
She sacrificed so much for me.

467
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.639
Now she's gone.

468
00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:11.606
Why am I even here?

469
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.317
CHIRON: You're here
because you're in jeopardy.

470
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.736
Everyone thinks you're
the lightning thief.

471
00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:18.822
Look, I didn't steal it.

472
00:28:23.326 --> 00:28:27.247
Zeus' bolt is the most
powerful weapon ever created.

473
00:28:28.248 --> 00:28:30.417
And if it's not returned
by the summer solstice

474
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.627
in ten days, there will be a war.

475
00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:34.504
This is your problem,
all right? Not mine.

476
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:36.631
This is about your world, not mine.

477
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:38.216
This is about all worlds.

478
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:41.928
Olympians would be
forced to choose sides.

479
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:43.930
Earth would become a battleground--

480
00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:47.684
mountains erupted,
earthquakes, raging fires.

481
00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:50.603
The end of life as you know it.

482
00:28:56.776 --> 00:28:58.194
What can we do?

483
00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:00.196
I want to take you to Olympus,

484
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.866
convince Zeus of your innocence.

485
00:29:02.949 --> 00:29:06.202
Someone's using you to start a war.

486
00:29:07.996 --> 00:29:09.539
What are we doing here? Let's go now.

487
00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:14.043
Your boldness is commendable,
but outside those gates,

488
00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:16.880
you will be in danger at all times.

489
00:29:16.963 --> 00:29:21.176
The Fury and the Minotaur
were only the beginning.

490
00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:25.054
First, we must train.

491
00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:33.229
GROVER (laughs):
This is always a fun game to watch.

492
00:29:34.314 --> 00:29:37.317
PERCY: Ow, God, how do you guys
wear this stuff? It weighs more than me.

493
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.235
Look, trust me,
wear it or you'll get killed.

494
00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:41.446
-(chuckles)
-Wait, what, what? Wait...

495
00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:43.281
CHIRON:
Heroes!

496
00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:45.408
Warriors!

497
00:29:45.492 --> 00:29:46.868
Fall in!

498
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.667
Hustle, hustle!

499
00:29:54.751 --> 00:29:57.754
Dylan, Paris, stop lollygagging!

500
00:29:59.839 --> 00:30:02.550
Percy, step forward.

501
00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:10.558
This is Percy Jackson.

502
00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:11.851
(indistinct whispering)

503
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:14.229
And he's going to need a team.

504
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.064
LUKE: We'll take him.

505
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.945
I'm Luke...

506
00:30:22.028 --> 00:30:26.199
son of Hermes and camp leader--
not necessarily in that order.

507
00:30:26.282 --> 00:30:27.575
Where's your helmet?

508
00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:29.786
No one gave me one.

509
00:30:29.869 --> 00:30:31.162
Uh...

510
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:34.415
Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?

511
00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:35.792
Kid's going to need it.

512
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.877
You're a goner, man.

513
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:42.632
I'm messing with you. Smile a little bit.
It's good for you, kid.

514
00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:44.050
Anybody got an extra helmet?

515
00:30:44.133 --> 00:30:46.219
Please pass it up.

516
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:51.057
Uh... try it on.

517
00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.685
That'll protect you.

518
00:30:53.768 --> 00:30:55.144
So will all of us.

519
00:30:55.895 --> 00:30:58.273
Welcome to the Blue Soldiers, my friend.

520
00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.693
CHIRON: All right, I want everyone
in position for Capture the Flag.

521
00:31:01.776 --> 00:31:05.822
First team to capture
the enemy's banner wins.

522
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:07.824
Dismissed.

523
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:11.077
RED SOLDIER LEADER:
Steady...

524
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.245
Steady!

525
00:31:12.328 --> 00:31:13.329
Now!

526
00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:16.541
(all yelling)

527
00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:25.425
(grunting)

528
00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.387
(screams, grunts)

529
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.015
(grunting and yelling)

530
00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.559
Percy, I know where the flag's at.
Come on.

531
00:31:34.642 --> 00:31:35.894
(panting)

532
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:39.564
(grunting and yelling)

533
00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:42.650
Keep your eyes open.
Don't get killed.

534
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.819
W-W-W-Whoa, whoa!

535
00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:46.321
-(soldiers grunting)
-Whoa.

536
00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:47.906
(grunting)

537
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.993
(Percy panting, soldier grunting)

538
00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:53.578
-Whoa!
-(soldier grunts)

539
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.580
(both grunting)

540
00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:56.998
(Percy panting)

541
00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:58.291
I'm coming. Buddy, I'm coming.

542
00:31:58.374 --> 00:32:00.209
Sons of Ares-- watch out, whoa.

543
00:32:00.293 --> 00:32:02.128
-That's a sword. That's a sword.
-(grunting)

544
00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:05.089
(panting)

545
00:32:05.173 --> 00:32:08.051
Oh, you guys take camp
way too seriously.

546
00:32:08.134 --> 00:32:09.510
Go!

547
00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:10.803
(all grunting)

548
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.397
No...

549
00:32:21.481 --> 00:32:22.941
...way!

550
00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:26.819
Percy, get out of here.
Go look for the flag.

551
00:32:26.903 --> 00:32:28.988
How did I just do that?

552
00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:38.498
(panting)

553
00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.300
No...

554
00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:58.810
(laughs)

555
00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:01.688
I won.

556
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

557
00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:06.818
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

558
00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:15.451
My mother is goddess
of wisdom and battle strategy.

559
00:33:15.535 --> 00:33:18.121
Do you know what that means?

560
00:33:18.204 --> 00:33:20.206
I always win.

561
00:33:20.289 --> 00:33:22.583
I always lose.

562
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.210
Maybe we're both wrong.

563
00:33:24.293 --> 00:33:26.170
(Annabeth grunts, Percy gasps)

564
00:33:26.254 --> 00:33:28.548
Aah! Ow!

565
00:33:43.646 --> 00:33:45.440
Okay, Chiron, shouldn't we
get in there and stop 'em?

566
00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.525
-She's killing him, man.
-You've got to be kidding.

567
00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:49.318
This is the best part.

568
00:33:49.402 --> 00:33:50.945
(both grunting)

569
00:33:56.284 --> 00:33:58.161
Stand up and fight.

570
00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.372
Hero.

571
00:34:03.082 --> 00:34:04.208
(both grunting)

572
00:34:04.292 --> 00:34:06.502
(Annabeth panting)

573
00:34:06.586 --> 00:34:07.754
(Percy grunts)

574
00:34:07.837 --> 00:34:09.714
(Red Soldiers cheering)

575
00:34:16.012 --> 00:34:18.139
Come on, Perce.
Come on, Perce.

576
00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:20.767
(cheering continues)

577
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:27.231
POSEIDON:
<i>Go to the water.</i>

578
00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.575
<i>The water will give you power.</i>

579
00:34:50.296 --> 00:34:53.591
(soft jingling)

580
00:34:59.388 --> 00:35:02.225
(soft jingling)

581
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.980
(soft jingling)

582
00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.276
(grunts)

583
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:29.710
-Take him out.
-Go for it.

584
00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.215
(yells)

585
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.633
(grunting)

586
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.607
(Chiron and Grover laughing)

587
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:52.692
Yeah!

588
00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.903
(yelling)

589
00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.363
Hya! Hya! Hya!

590
00:35:57.446 --> 00:35:58.990
(Red Soldier grunts)

591
00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.385
(both panting)

592
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:39.030
(blade whooshes)

593
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:40.740
(quietly)
Huh?

594
00:36:53.753 --> 00:36:56.714
(Blue Soldiers cheering)

595
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.931
Yeah, Perce!

596
00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:08.267
(cheering continues)

597
00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:13.689
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

598
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:15.691
-Yeah!
-Sons of Ares!

599
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.783
-Sons of Ares!
-Whoo!

600
00:37:23.866 --> 00:37:25.701
-Get up there.
-Yeah!

601
00:37:25.785 --> 00:37:27.578
All right, yeah!

602
00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:29.455
GROVER:
Excuse me, excuse me.

603
00:37:29.538 --> 00:37:31.916
Ladies and gentlemen, the son
of Poseidon is coming through.

604
00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:34.961
A hero is coming through.
Move it.

605
00:37:35.044 --> 00:37:36.629
Hey, no dirty looks.
Stop that.

606
00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:37.713
Sorry.

607
00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.215
Um, hey, Percy?

608
00:37:40.049 --> 00:37:41.968
Um, we're having a party
at our place later.

609
00:37:42.051 --> 00:37:43.970
And we would really love it
if you came.

610
00:37:44.053 --> 00:37:45.596
I would love to come;
that'd be great.

611
00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.765
-That would be amazing.
-Awesome.

612
00:37:47.848 --> 00:37:49.558
I would love to come, too--
to the party.

613
00:37:49.642 --> 00:37:51.644
You know, thanks
for inviting me, ladies.

614
00:37:51.727 --> 00:37:53.062
Beat it, nymphs.

615
00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:56.482
Wait. Don't leave.
Ladies, I'm available.

616
00:37:56.565 --> 00:37:58.276
Wait, come on, don't leave.
I'm available.

617
00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:00.152
What time is the party?

618
00:38:00.236 --> 00:38:02.738
-Feeling like a hero?
-More like a mutant.

619
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:06.742
I'm not going to grow a fish tail or gills
or anything like that, am I?

620
00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.452
Not likely.

621
00:38:08.536 --> 00:38:10.830
Although a huge ego
isn't out of the question.

622
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.585
You know, you could have
killed me out there?

623
00:38:16.669 --> 00:38:19.088
I could have died if I was normal.

624
00:38:19.171 --> 00:38:20.589
But you aren't.

625
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:24.552
I get a sense that you
don't like me very much.

626
00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:26.262
It's possible.

627
00:38:26.345 --> 00:38:27.930
I mean, our parents hate each other.

628
00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:31.142
-Wait. They do?
-Mm-hmm.

629
00:38:31.225 --> 00:38:34.645
I definitely have
strong feelings for you.

630
00:38:34.729 --> 00:38:37.773
Just haven't decided
if they're positive or negative yet.

631
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:42.570
Well, you let me know
when you figure it out.

632
00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.572
You'll be the first.

633
00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:50.870
(all gasping, murmuring)

634
00:39:01.297 --> 00:39:04.050
(screaming)

635
00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:08.846
Percy Jackson, show yourself!

636
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:14.143
(crowd screaming)

637
00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.898
(gasping)

638
00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.574
(screaming)

639
00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:29.658
CHIRON:
Hades!

640
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:30.743
Stay back!

641
00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:36.916
Percy Jackson, bring me the bolt.

642
00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:42.338
Be a good boy.

643
00:39:42.421 --> 00:39:46.675
Hand it to me and I will
exchange it for your mother.

644
00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:48.886
CHIRON:
Percy.

645
00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:50.971
Don't listen, Percy!

646
00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:56.519
My mother's gone!

647
00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.315
No, your mother is still alive.

648
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:04.193
I sent the Minotaur to abduct her.

649
00:40:04.276 --> 00:40:07.154
She is here with me
in the underworld.

650
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.913
Mom?

651
00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:17.373
Percy...

652
00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:25.589
What have you done with my mother?

653
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:27.883
If you ever want to
see your mother again,

654
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:29.885
you will bring me the bolt.

655
00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:32.930
(all gasping, murmuring)

656
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.893
Chiron, I have to go get her.

657
00:40:37.977 --> 00:40:40.855
Percy...
you don't have the bolt.

658
00:40:40.938 --> 00:40:42.731
Look, I'll tell him the truth.

659
00:40:42.815 --> 00:40:45.734
When he realizes
I'm not the thief, he'll release her.

660
00:40:45.818 --> 00:40:48.612
No, you cannot
negotiate with Hades.

661
00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:51.907
When he finds out
you don't have the bolt,

662
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:53.492
he will kill you and your mother.

663
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.744
This is her only chance.

664
00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.581
No. Stick to our plan.

665
00:40:59.665 --> 00:41:02.960
Travel to Olympus, bargain with Zeus.

666
00:41:03.043 --> 00:41:06.297
Once you convince him of your
innocence, we will do everything

667
00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.382
in our power to bring
back your mother.

668
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.762
-Okay.
-Yes.

669
00:41:20.936 --> 00:41:22.104
(groans)

670
00:41:29.778 --> 00:41:31.113
Going somewhere?

671
00:41:32.114 --> 00:41:34.408
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going... for a walk.

672
00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:35.826
Oh, for a walk!
I'm coming with you.

673
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.244
-No. No.
-Yeah.

674
00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.996
-I'm going alone.
-No, I'm coming with you.

675
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.165
-No!
-(laughs) You're being followed.

676
00:41:45.044 --> 00:41:46.962
-GROVER: You're stressing me out.
-Leave me alone.

677
00:41:47.046 --> 00:41:49.215
-We've got a 1:00 demigod curfew, okay?
-Leave me alone.

678
00:41:49.298 --> 00:41:50.674
Go to sleep or something.

679
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.301
No.

680
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.929
ANNABETH: One small victory,
and you're ready to fight Hades?

681
00:41:55.012 --> 00:41:57.139
-Ooh, double team.
-Really? You, too?

682
00:41:57.223 --> 00:42:00.267
Look, I just found out
my mother is still alive.

683
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.353
-I'm going to get her back.
-From the underworld?

684
00:42:02.436 --> 00:42:03.729
Whatever it takes.

685
00:42:03.812 --> 00:42:05.231
Oh, yeah, well, maybe
you'll outsmart Hades.

686
00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:06.315
Maybe I will.

687
00:42:06.398 --> 00:42:07.858
Look, man, I can't let you
do this, okay?

688
00:42:07.942 --> 00:42:11.111
Look, I'm not asking
for your permission.

689
00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:12.238
Okay.

690
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:16.116
Well, according to regulations,
if I can't stop you, I must accompany you,

691
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.869
'cause I'm your best friend
and your protector.

692
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:19.995
Junior protector.

693
00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:22.581
(laughs)
Is that really necessary?

694
00:42:22.665 --> 00:42:24.458
I don't need your help, okay?

695
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.585
This is something I have to do on my own.

696
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.254
Yeah, well, we weren't asking
for your permission.

697
00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:29.630
Come on, all right?

698
00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:32.675
Today, you tried to kill me.
Now you want to defend me?

699
00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:35.177
ANNABETH: That wasn't real.
That was just training.

700
00:42:35.261 --> 00:42:36.262
Yeah.

701
00:42:36.345 --> 00:42:39.098
Percy, that's all I've ever done
is train and train and train.

702
00:42:39.181 --> 00:42:43.018
I've grown up here. I've only been
in the outside world a couple of times.

703
00:42:43.102 --> 00:42:46.188
And I've never had the chance
to go on an actual quest.

704
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:50.985
Besides... you've won one battle,
and I've won hundreds.

705
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.903
You're going to need my experience.

706
00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:54.697
Good point.
(chuckles)

707
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.325
You two really want to come?

708
00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.285
-Yeah!
-Yes!

709
00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:03.205
Okay. I guess we're all going.

710
00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:07.167
So, who knows how to
get to the underworld?

711
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:09.378
Did not think of that one.

712
00:43:11.297 --> 00:43:14.300
I think I know someone who might.

713
00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.302
MAN IN VIDEO GAME:
Friendly Harriers inbound.

714
00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:21.599
-Luke?
-Hmm?

715
00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:24.935
Hey, guys.

716
00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:29.523
Percy, figured you'd
stop by sooner or later.

717
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.358
Everybody does.

718
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.444
-(video game gunfire)
-Get away from all that...

719
00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:36.780
Renaissance Faire stuff
out there, you know?

720
00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:40.659
But, uh...

721
00:43:41.243 --> 00:43:43.454
welcome to the modern world.

722
00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:45.623
Cool... new stuff.

723
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.628
What are you guys up to?

724
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:52.630
We're going to get my mom back.

725
00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:54.757
Oh.

726
00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.508
ANNABETH: Your dad
is the messenger of the gods,

727
00:43:56.592 --> 00:44:00.721
one of the only ones who's gotten
in and out of the underworld.

728
00:44:00.804 --> 00:44:02.931
Do you have any idea how?

729
00:44:03.015 --> 00:44:06.560
Mmm... My dad's a jerk.
I've never met him.

730
00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.270
You, too?

731
00:44:08.354 --> 00:44:10.481
Guess we all got daddy issues, huh?

732
00:44:10.564 --> 00:44:12.900
That's because all gods
are the same:

733
00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.401
selfish.

734
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.528
They only care about themselves.

735
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:19.948
But I once broke into my dad's house.

736
00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:21.784
Got some cool stuff.

737
00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.751
(blows)

738
00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.586
(coughs)

739
00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:35.381
For you.

740
00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:45.683
Oh!

741
00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:48.686
Flying shoes?!

742
00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:50.354
Mm-hmm.

743
00:44:50.437 --> 00:44:52.064
They're my dad's.

744
00:44:53.065 --> 00:44:55.067
He has hundreds of these little guys.

745
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.027
(grunts)

746
00:44:58.278 --> 00:45:00.239
Won't even miss 'em.

747
00:45:00.322 --> 00:45:02.032
Look underneath the other one.

748
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:09.164
You see, people have gone
to the underworld before,

749
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:10.833
without having to be dead.

750
00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:12.418
Hercules did it. Orpheus did it.

751
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.378
My dad does it all the time.

752
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:16.171
Getting in's the easy part.

753
00:45:16.255 --> 00:45:19.216
Getting out-- now, that's tricky.

754
00:45:19.299 --> 00:45:21.885
This is a map to Persephone's pearls.

755
00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:25.013
Persephone?
You mean Hades' wife?

756
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:28.392
Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
Keeps her prisoner.

757
00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:30.352
LUKE: Needless to say,
she hates it there.

758
00:45:30.436 --> 00:45:32.688
It's hot. He's a weirdo.

759
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:36.275
So, she has, um... secret visitors.

760
00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:38.193
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

761
00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:40.654
LUKE: She keeps pearls hidden
for them all over the world,

762
00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:44.450
and these pearls, they provide
a quick escape from the underworld.

763
00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:46.160
You could use them to get out.

764
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.203
So, how do the pearls work?

765
00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:50.038
Easy.

766
00:45:50.122 --> 00:45:52.458
You take a pearl, step on it,
you crush it,

767
00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.543
visualize where you want
to be taken.

768
00:45:54.626 --> 00:45:57.045
Right now, there's three pearls
in the United States.

769
00:45:57.129 --> 00:45:58.338
This map will guide you there.

770
00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:00.966
Right here is your first location.

771
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:05.679
GROVER: "Auntie Em's
Garden Emporium." Huh.

772
00:46:05.763 --> 00:46:07.931
Once you find the first pearl,
the map will show you

773
00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:11.185
the next one and the next one,
and then you're off to Hades.

774
00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.061
Which, um...

775
00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:15.939
reminds me-- you guys...

776
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:18.442
might need some extra
protection, so, uh...

777
00:46:21.487 --> 00:46:23.489
My favorite shield.

778
00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:25.616
You might want to take a step back.

779
00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:30.454
(clicks)

780
00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:32.539
(gasps)

781
00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:33.916
Mmm.

782
00:46:35.334 --> 00:46:37.252
Hey. Thanks, Luke.

783
00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:39.129
Ah, don't mention it.

784
00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:42.925
But, uh, you're going to have
to promise me one thing.

785
00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:45.511
If you see my dad
on the highway to hell...

786
00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:46.720
Yeah?

787
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.680
...kick his ass for me.

788
00:46:50.015 --> 00:46:54.686
AC/DC:

796
00:47:19.211 --> 00:47:22.339
This place definitely
needs an extreme makeover.

797
00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:24.508
<i>(music fades out)</i>

798
00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:28.512
Hello!

799
00:47:30.389 --> 00:47:31.723
Hello?

800
00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:33.642
Anybody home in Auntie-ville?

801
00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:35.310
(chuckles)
Check this out.

802
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:36.979
They got free sodas.

803
00:47:37.062 --> 00:47:38.814
(chuckling)

804
00:47:38.897 --> 00:47:39.940
(squeaking)

805
00:47:40.023 --> 00:47:41.567
(shrieks)

806
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.819
Okay. That's nasty.

807
00:47:43.902 --> 00:47:46.572
The health department needs
to give this place a F.

808
00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:48.532
Ooh...

809
00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:52.744
Hey, guys, check this out.

810
00:47:55.414 --> 00:47:57.416
(jingling)

811
00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:02.963
Look at this.

812
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.258
Nice.

813
00:48:07.259 --> 00:48:09.177
Gold drachmas.

814
00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:10.721
That means we're on the right track.

815
00:48:11.305 --> 00:48:12.514
Here.

816
00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.767
How are we going
to find a pearl in this place?

817
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:17.895
GROVER:
That's a good question.

818
00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:20.272
Okay, let's split up.
Check everything.

819
00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:21.356
-Good idea.
-Yeah.

820
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.524
I'm gonna go this way.

821
00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:28.697
Hello!

822
00:48:45.464 --> 00:48:48.383
-Get out! She's coming!
-What? Who?

823
00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:51.303
We stopped-- d-directions.
My poor husband!

824
00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:54.181
Help me!
Please, help me!

825
00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:01.897
(laughing)

826
00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.690
Oh!

827
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:05.400
Check this out.

828
00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:07.402
He's just like my Uncle Ferdinand.

829
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:09.404
(laughing)

830
00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:10.697
That's crazy.

831
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.742
Got the mole in the same place.

832
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.996
No. It's not my Uncle Ferdinand,

833
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.957
'cause my Uncle Ferdinand
was killed by...

834
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.501
(whispering) Medusa.

835
00:49:22.584 --> 00:49:24.461
Oh.

836
00:49:24.544 --> 00:49:25.796
Percy!

837
00:49:25.879 --> 00:49:28.423
Annabeth! We're in trouble!

838
00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:29.883
Grover?!

839
00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:36.139
Please, we have to leave
before she finds us!

840
00:49:36.223 --> 00:49:38.558
-Who?
-She turned my husband to stone!

841
00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.686
Grover, where are you?

842
00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:43.063
Percy!

843
00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:44.982
Annabeth!

844
00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:47.484
Annabeth, where are you?

845
00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:48.860
Grover!

846
00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:49.987
(grunting)

847
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:54.366
Come on, man.
Watch where you're going.

848
00:49:54.449 --> 00:49:56.535
-Perce, listen!
-Where are we?

849
00:49:56.618 --> 00:49:58.453
We're in Medusa's lair.

850
00:49:58.537 --> 00:50:00.372
-Annabeth!
-Annie!

851
00:50:00.455 --> 00:50:03.583
We're lost!
We'll never leave!

852
00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:04.751
Don't move.

853
00:50:08.797 --> 00:50:12.634
Well, this is a fabulous surprise.

854
00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:14.386
It's so...

855
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:18.765
heartening
to have such young visitors.

856
00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.393
We get so lonely here.

857
00:50:22.394 --> 00:50:23.687
Don't we?

858
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.147
(hissing)

859
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:28.900
That's why I create my statues.

860
00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.405
They're my only company...

861
00:50:35.782 --> 00:50:37.701
...daughter of Athena.

862
00:50:37.784 --> 00:50:39.244
How do you know me?

863
00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:43.040
You have such beautiful hair.

864
00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:47.586
I once had hair like that.

865
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.922
I was courted...

866
00:50:52.007 --> 00:50:55.385
desired by many suitors.

867
00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.805
But that all changed...

868
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.517
because of your mother--

869
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:05.270
the woman who cursed me.

870
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:08.440
Who turned me...

871
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:11.943
Don't look!

872
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:13.695
...into this!

873
00:51:13.779 --> 00:51:15.322
(hissing)

874
00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:19.785
They say the eyes
are windows to the soul.

875
00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:24.539
I hope you find my eyes...

876
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:27.250
(snakes hissing and rattling)

877
00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:29.252
...attractive.

878
00:51:31.254 --> 00:51:35.926
So rude, not looking people in the eyes.

879
00:51:36.009 --> 00:51:37.469
(anxious gasping)

880
00:51:37.552 --> 00:51:39.763
Come on...

881
00:51:39.846 --> 00:51:43.850
sneak a peek.

882
00:51:50.649 --> 00:51:53.527
(hissing)

883
00:52:02.661 --> 00:52:05.580
Okay, now, how are we supposed
to fight something we can't look at?

884
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:07.582
We can look at a reflection.

885
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.210
Check this out.

886
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:13.004
All right. Good idea.
I'm gonna go get Annabeth.

887
00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:14.381
Okay. I'm going
to take care of Medusa.

888
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:15.590
All right.

889
00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:17.509
MEDUSA: You make
a wonderful addition

890
00:52:17.592 --> 00:52:19.970
to my collection.

891
00:52:20.053 --> 00:52:23.390
We'll be friends forever.

892
00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:25.100
Do you mind?

893
00:52:28.645 --> 00:52:30.147
Oh, no, no...

894
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:32.065
(snakes hissing, rattling)

895
00:52:34.359 --> 00:52:36.611
Sooner or later,

896
00:52:36.695 --> 00:52:40.699
you will open those eyes.

897
00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:48.123
The temptation to look at me
is too hard to resist.

898
00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:50.500
Don't look, Annabeth.
Don't open your eyes.

899
00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:51.877
(hissing)

900
00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.712
Who's that?

901
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:56.923
Another demigod.

902
00:53:03.638 --> 00:53:04.639
Mmm...

903
00:53:05.724 --> 00:53:08.101
I can sense you.

904
00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

905
00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:15.192
(snakes hissing)

906
00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:18.737
(panting)

907
00:53:26.077 --> 00:53:28.413
Hmm...

908
00:53:28.496 --> 00:53:30.665
son of Poseidon.

909
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.462
I used to date your daddy.

910
00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.546
(grunts)

911
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:42.302
(gasps, groans)

912
00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.889
(hissing in distance)

913
00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:47.682
(gasps, yelps)

914
00:53:47.766 --> 00:53:48.808
Need a hand?

915
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.602
Oh, Grover.

916
00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:53.897
-(Grover grunts)
-Thanks.

917
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.399
-Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

918
00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:58.443
(grunting)

919
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:06.701
I hear you have the lightning bolt.

920
00:54:06.785 --> 00:54:08.745
May I see it?

921
00:54:09.329 --> 00:54:11.248
I don't have it!

922
00:54:11.331 --> 00:54:12.832
(hissing)

923
00:54:13.833 --> 00:54:16.670
Let me see your eyes.

924
00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:21.299
I hear they're bluer
than the Circassian Sea.

925
00:54:21.883 --> 00:54:23.718
Open them,

926
00:54:23.802 --> 00:54:26.054
or my hungry babies

927
00:54:26.137 --> 00:54:29.474
will have to open them for you.

928
00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:35.355
But it would be such a pity

929
00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:41.111
to destroy such a young
and handsome face.

930
00:54:42.988 --> 00:54:46.116
Stay with me, Percy.

931
00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.036
All you have to do

932
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.457
is look.

933
00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:00.046
(engine revving, tires screeching)

934
00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.639
(panting)

935
00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:11.016
Are you okay?

936
00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:13.768
(yells, laughs)

937
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:15.520
Yeah, I'm okay!

938
00:55:16.855 --> 00:55:18.857
(snakes hissing)

939
00:55:21.943 --> 00:55:24.821
Son of Poseidon!

940
00:55:35.248 --> 00:55:36.374
(gasps)

941
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:38.585
(panting)

942
00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.503
Heads up.

943
00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:46.134
PERCY:
Hey, guys.

944
00:55:46.217 --> 00:55:48.803
It's cool to open up your eyes.

945
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:53.808
Annabeth, that was great,
great demigod driving.

946
00:55:53.892 --> 00:55:54.934
Thanks.

947
00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.102
Oh...

948
00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:57.645
Ugh!

949
00:55:57.729 --> 00:55:59.814
ANNABETH:
We should take it with us.

950
00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:02.025
GROVER:
The head? Oh, no. That's sick.

951
00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:05.612
If you open the eyes,
they still work, dead or alive.

952
00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:08.114
You never know when something
like that might come in handy.

953
00:56:08.198 --> 00:56:09.783
Yeah, you're right,
but I'm not touching it.

954
00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.368
Come on, man.
Just take off your jacket.

955
00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:13.078
We'll wrap it up
until we get some ice.

956
00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:16.289
Oh, why I gotta
take off my jacket?

957
00:56:16.373 --> 00:56:17.624
Because you're the protector.

958
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:20.877
Yeah, you're right.
I am the protector.

959
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.506
So I'm gonna give you my hoodie,
not my jacket, okay?

960
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:26.716
Come on, you baby.

961
00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:30.845
Disgusting.

962
00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:31.971
Just toss it up.

963
00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.848
You know, don't... Ugh!

964
00:56:33.932 --> 00:56:36.226
-Hey. Hey.
-Nasty.

965
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:37.811
Guys, wait.

966
00:56:38.895 --> 00:56:40.271
The pearl.

967
00:56:45.026 --> 00:56:47.112
One down, two to go.

968
00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:52.951
ANNABETH: Would have been nice
if Luke had warned us about Medusa.

969
00:56:53.034 --> 00:56:54.494
Maybe he just didn't know.

970
00:56:55.495 --> 00:56:57.914
GPS from the gods, where to next?

971
00:56:59.207 --> 00:57:00.291
Let's see.

972
00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:08.341
The Parthenon in Nashville.

973
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:10.885
Nashville?! Aw, great.

974
00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:12.929
Home of my least favorite music.

975
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:14.931
Yee-haw!

Hi.

993
00:58:25.043 --> 00:58:26.419
Nice work today.

994
00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:28.463
Thanks.

995
00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:32.133
What happened to you?

996
00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:33.843
Oh...

to stone-- she, um...

998
00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:39.015
she had a tight grip.

999
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:42.644
Check this out.

1000
00:58:54.906 --> 00:58:57.116
(chuckles)
Cool.

1001
00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.244
Very cool.

1002
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:03.248
So...

1003
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:05.500
why do our parents hate each other?

1004
00:59:05.583 --> 00:59:09.128
They both wanted to be
patron god of Athens,

1005
00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:12.173
and the people chose Athena.

1006
00:59:12.257 --> 00:59:16.177
And, um, our parents have
hated each other ever since.

1007
00:59:17.178 --> 00:59:19.764
-What's your mom like?
-I don't know.

1008
00:59:20.348 --> 00:59:21.516
I never met her.

1009
00:59:21.599 --> 00:59:22.976
What?

1010
00:59:23.059 --> 00:59:26.020
Wait, is it... is it
like this for everybody?

1011
00:59:26.104 --> 00:59:28.022
Don't any gods see their kids?

1012
00:59:28.106 --> 00:59:29.482
It's forbidden.

1013
00:59:30.817 --> 00:59:33.152
Right after we were born,
Zeus decreed

1014
00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:35.488
that the gods couldn't
have physical contact

1015
00:59:35.572 --> 00:59:37.282
with their mortal offspring.

1016
00:59:37.365 --> 00:59:39.701
Oh, that's a stupid law.

1017
00:59:39.784 --> 00:59:41.035
I agree.

1018
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:45.039
Although, um...

1019
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:46.708
between us...

1020
00:59:47.792 --> 00:59:50.670
I think my mother speaks
to me sometimes.

1021
00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.547
In times of trouble,

1022
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.633
I hear her voice giving me advice.

1023
00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:57.760
-That's happened to me.
-Yeah.

1024
00:59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.263
That's your father talking to you.

1025
01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:02.890
GROVER:
Hey, yo, Percy!

1026
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.809
Get in here, man.
This is ugly.

1027
01:00:04.892 --> 01:00:06.769
(sighs)

1028
01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:08.313
Right.

1029
01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.481
GROVER:
Hey, hurry up!

1030
01:00:10.565 --> 01:00:13.526
Perce, check this out, man.

1031
01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.944
You're on TV.

1032
01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.447
...surrounding the missing boy,
Percy Jackson,

1033
01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.490
and his mother, Sally Ugliano.

1034
01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:22.994
But their relatives have
some interesting theories.

1035
01:00:23.077 --> 01:00:25.872
So, Mr. Ugliano, talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.

1036
01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.082
No, he's not my son.
He's stepson.

1037
01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:30.209
He did not come from these loins.

1038
01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.711
Ever since he started with the drugs

1039
01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.379
and the alcohol,
he's never been the same.

1040
01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.131
-Oh, no.
-GABE: Five nights ago...

1041
01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.634
he tried to kill me, and he
threw his mother on the ground,

1042
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.969
and his cripple friend
then attacked me

1043
01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.388
from behind and knocked me out.

1044
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:46.643
When I woke up, Sally was gone.
She was kidnapped by Percy.

1045
01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.102
-She would never leave without...
-Oh, shut up, Gabe.

1046
01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.854
-(TV turns off)
-Great.

1047
01:00:49.937 --> 01:00:51.356
Now I'm a fugitive.

1048
01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.691
See? That's what I'm
talking about, man.

1049
01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.693
Gabe's always running his mouth.

1050
01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:58.655
He's just mad because
I busted him up with my crutches.

1051
01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:00.114
Oh!

1052
01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:01.532
Guys...

1053
01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.662
I can't pee with her watching me.

1054
01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:08.581
(rattling outside)

1055
01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:11.084
(gasps)

1056
01:01:11.167 --> 01:01:12.585
(maid screaming)

1057
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.381
¡Ay, Dios mío!

1058
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:19.008
Sorry, guys.

1059
01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.843
I messed up.
Should've closed the curtains.

1060
01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.012
ANNABETH: Come on, guys.

1061
01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.265
Let's hit the road before
Homeland Security shows up.

1062
01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:44.909
(people conversing, shouting)

1063
01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:49.539
(laughter, chattering)

1064
01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:03.636
ANNABETH:
Wow. That's amazing.

1065
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.264
A complete replica
of the Parthenon in Nashville.

1066
01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:08.725
All right, guys.
Let's go get the pearl.

1067
01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.977
(clank)

1068
01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.406
Wow.

1069
01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.250
Hey...

1070
01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.668
That's your mom.

1071
01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.213
Wonder if she really looks like that.

1072
01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.260
We'll find out.

1073
01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:50.933
Guys, check this out.

1074
01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.018
Oh, my.

1075
01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:54.228
(quietly)
Oh, no.

1076
01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:55.646
It's the pearl.

1077
01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:02.612
That was easy.

1078
01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:03.780
Easy?

1079
01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:07.909
It's 30 feet in the air,
and this place is filled with tourists.

1080
01:03:09.368 --> 01:03:11.496
I got an idea.

1081
01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:14.624
We'll come back after this place closes.
Come on. Follow me.

1082
01:03:14.707 --> 01:03:17.043
Or I can just throw my crutch up there.

1083
01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.086
I'm saying the pearl will fall out.

1084
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:20.254
-PERCY: Grover!
-Perce, I'm saying the...

1085
01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:21.756
It's not a bad idea.

1086
01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.677
(siren wailing in distance)

1087
01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.271
The park's been closed for an hour.

1088
01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.232
Let's move.

1089
01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:40.566
Yes, sir.

1090
01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.361
-All right, this'll be easy.
-GROVER: Okay.

1091
01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:45.738
I'm gonna fly up; I'm gonna use
Luke's flying shoes.

1092
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.281
-Cool.
-I'm gonna grab the pearl...

1093
01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.242
-Cool.
-...and then-- Oh.

1094
01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:51.702
(whirring in distance)

1095
01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:58.835
Okay, so what are we going to do?

1096
01:04:00.044 --> 01:04:01.671
All right, guys.

1097
01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:03.756
I got this.

1098
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.007
You got what? Whoa, whoa.

1099
01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.843
Hey, whoa, hey, listen....

1100
01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.761
-You're gonna kill the janitors?
-Chill.

1101
01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.222
Those are working-class Americans.

1102
01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:14.809
(gasps, groans)

1103
01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.521
-(janitor gasps)
-Oh, man.

1104
01:04:18.604 --> 01:04:19.605
Aah!

1105
01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.108
(groans)

1106
01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:23.442
Aah!

1107
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.238
Aw, why did you do that?

1108
01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:29.615
They're not dead. They're unconscious.
Now, we have 30 minutes.

1109
01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.242
-Come on.
-Cool.

1110
01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.202
-Oh.
-(sighs with relief)

1111
01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.461
(grunts)

1112
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.966
Y'all, what's cracking?

1113
01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.342
Hey.

1114
01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:49.552
Luke.

1115
01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:50.761
LUKE (over laptop):
Annabeth.

1116
01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.805
How do you turn on the shoes?

1117
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.056
LUKE: Tell Percy he's got
to break into a run, okay?

1118
01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:59.478
He's got to build up speed, kind of
like a... a jet on a... on a runway.

1119
01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.314
But it's going to take some practice.

1120
01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.774
Okay.

1121
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.568
Whew... I got this.

1122
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.361
Oh!

1123
01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.488
GROVER: It's going
to take some practice!

1124
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.324
(gasping)
Whoa!

1125
01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:14.243
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1126
01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:15.786
(yelling)

1127
01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.789
-(gasping)
-GROVER: Whoa!

1128
01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:19.874
Whoa, whoa.

1129
01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:22.209
(panting)

1130
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.422
(grunting)

1131
01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:41.228
I got it.

1132
01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.772
-Yes!
-Yeah, Percy!

1133
01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:45.775
-GROVER: There we go.
-Oh, whoa, whoa.

1134
01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.028
-There it is.
-GROVER: Yeah.

1135
01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.655
(laughs)

1136
01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.531
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Way to go.

1137
01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:53.950
All right, let's grab everything, let's...

1138
01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:55.618
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1139
01:05:57.703 --> 01:05:58.913
Oh, man.

1140
01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:06.879
GROVER:
Look, I got this, okay?

1141
01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.632
Hey, guys, I'm with
Park Recreational Services.

1142
01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.509
You guys have been caught
sleeping on the job.

1143
01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.135
You better be happy
I'm not writing you guys up.

1144
01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.929
Okay? This is the last time.

1145
01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:16.973
ALL (droning): We've been
expecting you, Mr. Jackson.

1146
01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.558
(sighs) Not again.

1147
01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:22.687
Just give us the lightning bolt
and we'll let you go.

1148
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.398
Look, I don't have the lightning bolt.

1149
01:06:27.024 --> 01:06:29.276
Okay... this is bad.

1150
01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.779
(low moaning, crackling)

1151
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.663

Whoa!

1154
01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:48.421
(growling)

1155
01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:49.880
Hydra!

1156
01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:52.508
Guys, watch out!
The middle one spews fire!

1157
01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:57.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1158

Aah!

1161
01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.492
Oh, you got a sweet tooth.

1162
01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:19.660
All right.

1163
01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.120
How about that?

1164
01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.502
(grunting)

1165
01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:31.464
Yah!

1166
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.132
Whoa!

1167
01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.550
(grunting)

1168
01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:39.597
-(Hydra growls)
-Whoa!

1169
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.723
Percy, stop!

1170
01:07:40.806 --> 01:07:41.849
(grunts)

1171
01:07:41.932 --> 01:07:44.518
-No!

1172
01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.103
-(Hydra growls)
-Whoa!

1173
01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:57.531
-How flippin' awesome was that?
-Whoo!

1174
01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.783
-I just killed that thing.
-Give me some, my man.

1175
01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.326
Killed it?! You only made it worse.

1176
01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.911
What are you talking about?

1177
01:08:01.994 --> 01:08:04.038
Percy, when you cut off
one Hydra head...

1178
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:05.998
two more grow back.

1179

-GROVER: Get back!
-(all scream)

1181
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:20.012
Distract that thing!
I'll get the pearl!

Whoa, oh, oh!

Ow, ow, ow!

1196
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.463
Open the door!

1197
01:09:36.547 --> 01:09:38.424
The door won't open!

Scientists are baffled
by what now appears

1208
01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.436
to be a single storm cloud
that is expanding over much

1209
01:10:32.519 --> 01:10:35.731
of Europe and Asia,
moving towards the United States.

1210
01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:39.235
Savage winds, rain, and
mammoth waves are being reported

1211

along the coastlines
of several continents.

1212
01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.239
So far, no casualties,

1213
01:10:43.322 --> 01:10:46.367
but countries everywhere
are preparing for the worst.

1216
01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:52.498
Yeah.

I've been looking forward to this.

GROVER: We got poker.
We got blackjack.

1232
01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.075
Grover, we're not here to have fun.

1233
01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.244
We just need to grab
the pearl and go, okay?

1234

Where would we find
a green pearl in this place?

Um, maybe on a cocktail
waitress or a showgirl.

1254
01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.926
We should start there.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:18.081
"Woe to all depraved souls."

1427
01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.128
(rumbling, cracking)

1428
01:21:44.441 --> 01:21:47.360
(debris clattering)

1429
01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.155
(sudden crash echoing)

1430
01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.532
Well, guess it ain't
no turning back now.

1431
01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:55.076
Yep. Looks like
we're stuck in here.

1432
01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.286
Yeah.

1433
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.383
GROVER: Hey, Perce,
who's that creepy guy with the hoodie?

1434
01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:11.635
PERCY:
I don't know.

1435
01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:13.720
Let's find out.

1436
01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.434
Who are you?

1437
01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:21.561
We need to see Hades.

1438
01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:24.189
FERRYMAN:
The living are not permitted here.

1439
01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:26.942
Die and come back.

1440
01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:31.446
Okay, we won't (imitating voice)
"die and come back," but...

1441
01:22:31.529 --> 01:22:34.407
(sighs)
You know what?

1442
01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:37.410
-I think I know what he wants.
-What?

1443
01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.412
You gotta pay the ferryman.

1444
01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:41.373
Watch this.

1445
01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.375
Yo, my friend!
(chuckles)

1446
01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.502
What up? (chuckles)

1447
01:22:45.585 --> 01:22:47.128
Okay, guess not.

1448
01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:48.755
Look, you like dead people, right?

1449
01:22:48.838 --> 01:22:51.174
I got a few dead people
you might recognize.

1450
01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:54.219
Check this out.
Jackson, Grant.

1451
01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:57.514
And look who's joining
the party: Benjamin Franklin.

1452
01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.140
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

1453
01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.434
Look, you give us a boat ride,
you take the money,

1454
01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:04.479
and you get an interior decorator,
'cause it is too depressing in here.

1455
01:23:04.562 --> 01:23:06.272
A'ight? There you go.

1456
01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:11.611
(gasps)

1457
01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.532
GROVER:
That was $170!

1458
01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.951
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1459
01:23:18.034 --> 01:23:19.744
The drachma, the drachma.

1460
01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:30.922
Climb aboard.

1461
01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.466
Thanks for telling me, man. You're
burning money; we're in a recession.

1462
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.260
-That's treason.
-Shut up. Shut up. Get on.

1463
01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.273
(rumbling)

1464
01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:51.693
(people screaming in distance)

1465
01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:57.032
FERRYMAN:
Welcome to the underworld.

1466
01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:03.246
What is all this?

1467
01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:05.081
(distant screaming and wailing)

1468
01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:08.501
The scrap heap of human misery.

1469
01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.962
Lost hopes and dreams.

1470
01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.133
Wishes that never came true.

1471
01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:17.052
(watch ticking)

1472
01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:29.522
(distant screams echoing)

1473
01:24:29.606 --> 01:24:33.109
FERRYMAN: All lives end
in suffering and tragedy.

1474
01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.197
(screams echoing)

1475
01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:03.640
This is as far as I go.

1476
01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:23.243
(growling echoes from distance)

1477
01:25:23.326 --> 01:25:25.078
Guys, do you hear that?

1478
01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:27.163
-PERCY: Yeah. What is that?
-GROVER: I don't know.

1479
01:25:28.873 --> 01:25:31.084
-(fierce growling)
-PERCY AND GROVER: Whoa!

1480
01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:32.418
Sit!

1481
01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:33.795
(growling)

1482
01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:36.047
-Annie, stab that thing!
-What are we going to do?

1483
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.340
-(growling)
-(Annabeth grunts)

1484
01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:38.591
Stop it!

1485
01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.844
(speaking Greek)

1486
01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:44.430
What were those things?

1487
01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:45.598
Hellhounds.

1488
01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:46.808
GROVER:
Yeah.

1489
01:25:46.891 --> 01:25:49.018
Well, maybe you should feed 'em.

1490
01:25:49.602 --> 01:25:52.021
They sensed the presence
of another animal.

1491
01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:55.108
-Great. They smell goat.
-Hmm!

1492
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:56.609
A satyr.

1493
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:01.156
I haven't had a satyr...

1494
01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:04.993
...visit before.

1495
01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:06.870
HADES:
Persephone!

1496
01:26:06.953 --> 01:26:09.956
What could possibly
be taking so long?

1497
01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:11.583
Don't ignore me!

1498
01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.501
Or what?!

1499
01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:15.503
What will you do?

1500
01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:17.213
I'm already in Hell.

1501
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:39.861
We have visitors.

1502
01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.616
Nephew.

1503
01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:57.545
Welcome.

1504
01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.216
You have your father's looks.

1505
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.762
Always the, uh,
lucky side of the family.

1506
01:27:05.845 --> 01:27:07.430
(Grover laughs)

1507
01:27:07.513 --> 01:27:09.474
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1508
01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.516
You're Hades?

1509
01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.310
-Yes.
-Oh, sorry.

1510
01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:15.521
I just didn't... I didn't expect you
to look like this, man.

1511
01:27:15.605 --> 01:27:17.023
Kind of stylish. I like it.

1512
01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:18.316
(chuckles)

1513
01:27:18.399 --> 01:27:20.151
Would you prefer that I looked like...

1514
01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:21.527
this?

1515
01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:22.946
(whooshing)

1516
01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:24.447
-GROVER: No! No! No!
-(growling)

1517
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:25.573
Oh, no!

1518
01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:29.285
No! No, no. Look, stick to
the Mick Jagger thing. It works for you.

1519
01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:31.287
(growling)

1520
01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:34.749
(clears throat)

1521
01:27:34.832 --> 01:27:36.459
Hmph!

1522
01:27:36.542 --> 01:27:38.544
(scoffs)

1523
01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:41.923
HADES:
You're very brave coming here.

1524
01:27:42.006 --> 01:27:43.591
Come closer.

1525
01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:48.137
(whispering)
Hey. Perce.

1526
01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.723
HADES: I can see the look
of disgust in your eyes,

1527
01:27:50.807 --> 01:27:52.600
but this existence
was not of my choosing.

1528
01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:55.645
I was banished here
by Zeus and your father.

1529
01:27:55.728 --> 01:27:57.063
I'm damned.

1530
01:27:58.147 --> 01:28:00.149
My only chance
of getting out of this place

1531
01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.235
is to defeat my brothers
and take control of Olympus.

1532
01:28:02.318 --> 01:28:04.153
But, of course, um...

1533
01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.031
I'll need the bolt.

1534
01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.908
And I need my mother.

1535
01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:10.493
Then we have an understanding.

1536
01:28:10.576 --> 01:28:13.121
You give me the bolt,
and I'll give you your mother.

1537
01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:21.879
I need to tell you the truth.
I'm... I'm not the lightning thief.

1538
01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.798
I don't have the bolt.

1539
01:28:23.881 --> 01:28:25.300
I never did.

1540
01:28:27.176 --> 01:28:29.137
Why did you come here, then?

1541
01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.765
Well, I was hoping that...

1542
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:36.894
when you saw that I wasn't the thief,
you'd let my mother go.

1543
01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:38.271
Yes.

1544
01:28:38.354 --> 01:28:40.398
Yes, but do you think I'm an idiot?

1545
01:28:41.482 --> 01:28:43.318
I'm Hades!

1546
01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:47.363
Now, give me the bolt,
or say good-bye to your mother.

1547
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.741
(gasps)

1548
01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:54.954
(whooshing)

1549
01:29:06.924 --> 01:29:08.593
(gasps)

1550
01:29:11.929 --> 01:29:13.222
Percy.

1551
01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.062
(buzzing and crackling)

1552
01:29:20.938 --> 01:29:23.775
(sighs)
I thought I lost you forever.

1553
01:29:23.858 --> 01:29:25.526
No.

1554
01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.075
(crackling)

1555
01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:39.874
(crackling)

1556
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.838
(crackling, rumbling)

1557
01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:51.052
Zeus' master bolt.

1558
01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.597
(Hades gasps in awe)

1559
01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:56.265
Liar.

1560
01:29:56.349 --> 01:29:59.268
I swear, I don't know
how that got there.

1561
01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:01.062
That's not even my shield.

1562
01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:03.606
ANNABETH:
No. Luke rigged it.

1563
01:30:03.689 --> 01:30:05.858
He put the bolt
in his shield and used us.

1564
01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.568
Luke stole the lightning bolt.

1565
01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.197
Um, I think we're done here.

1566
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.907
Feed them to the souls.

1567
01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.829
-(clanking, rumbling)
-(gasping)

1568
01:30:19.705 --> 01:30:22.458
(whooshing)

1569
01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.128
(screaming, howling, screeching)

1570
01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:29.006
-Whoa! Whoa!
-We had a deal, all right?

1571
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.217
You have the bolt. Just let us go.

1572
01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:33.219
Summon the hounds.

1573
01:30:34.303 --> 01:30:36.097
(speaks Greek)

1574
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.516
-(hounds growling, snarling)
-No... no on the dogs.

1575
01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:39.684
(fierce growling)

1576
01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:43.813
Lassie, sit! Sit!

1577
01:30:43.896 --> 01:30:45.982
(hounds growling)

1578
01:30:46.065 --> 01:30:47.984
(souls screeching)

1579
01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:53.781
I... am going to be king of the gods.

1580
01:30:53.865 --> 01:30:55.324
-No!
-Stay back!

1581
01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:56.534
(growls)

1582
01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.536
-Back!
-Stay!

1583
01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.204
(jaws snap)

1584
01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:05.209
-Mmm... mmm.
-Mmm... mmm.

1585
01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.922
All right, come on...
(anxious laugh)

1586
01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.549
Come on. Give it back.

1587
01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:12.925
(yells)

1588
01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:14.385
(grunting)

1589
01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:18.473
(laughing)

1590
01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:21.642
(howling, screeching)

1591
01:31:21.726 --> 01:31:22.935
(speaks Greek)

1592
01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:28.816
(anxious gasping)

1593
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.901
Bad dog!

1594
01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.404
(gasps)

1595
01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.990
He won't remember a thing!

1596
01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:39.535
Why'd you do that?

1597
01:31:39.619 --> 01:31:40.995
Because...

1598
01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:44.123
he's cruel and abusive!

1599
01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:46.667
The only thing I look forward to

1600
01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:49.754
is my allotted time
away from this hellhole.

1601
01:31:49.837 --> 01:31:55.718
A war of the gods would put
an end to that, and I'd be alone...

1602
01:31:55.801 --> 01:31:58.054
with only him...

1603
01:31:58.137 --> 01:31:59.555
forever.

1604
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:01.974
(scoffs)

1605
01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.518
Go.

1606
01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:05.770
Take the bolt and your mother.

1607
01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:08.147
(crackling)

1608
01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:10.441
(switch clicks, blade rings)

1609
01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:17.907
Only three?

1610
01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:21.744
Oh, no.

1611
01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:23.788
PERSEPHONE:
There are four of you.

1612
01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:27.416
Each pearl transports
only a single person.

1613
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:29.669
One of you will have to stay.

1614
01:32:30.753 --> 01:32:32.755
All right, I'll stay. You three go.

1615
01:32:32.838 --> 01:32:34.382
-SALLY: What? No!
-No. No, no, no.

1616
01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:37.134
I've achieved my quest.
I'm staying here.

1617
01:32:37.218 --> 01:32:38.344
ANNABETH: No. I've trained
for situations like this.

1618
01:32:38.427 --> 01:32:39.595
PERCY:
Neither of you are st...

1619
01:32:39.679 --> 01:32:41.722
Guys, guys, knock it off.

1620
01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:44.725
-I'm staying because I'm the protector.
-Grover, come on.

1621
01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:47.603
Look, man, I don't want
to hear it. Just go.

1622
01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:48.980
It's my duty.

1623
01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:51.899
It's what I'm meant for.

1624
01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:54.026
We'll come back for you.

1625
01:32:54.610 --> 01:32:58.447
I'll take very good care of him.

1626
01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.576
All right, now, move it, guys.

1627
01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:04.662
Each of you step on the pearl
and concentrate on where you want to go.

1628
01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:05.871
Take this.

1629
01:33:07.206 --> 01:33:08.583
To Olympus.

1630
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:16.090
(thunder rumbles)

1631
01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:18.634
(hissing, whooshing)

1632
01:33:28.227 --> 01:33:31.022
(hissing, whooshing fade)

1633
01:33:37.903 --> 01:33:39.155
(bleats)

1634
01:33:39.238 --> 01:33:40.531
(muffled grunt)

1635
01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:41.657
Whew!

1636
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:51.626
(deep whooshing)

1637
01:34:00.551 --> 01:34:03.095
(crackling)

1638
01:34:06.265 --> 01:34:09.727
(thunder crashing)

1639
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.646
Hey. Look.

1640
01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:14.106
(wind whistling)

1641
01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.695
Zeus and Poseidon
preparing for battle.

1642
01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:21.322
No...

1643
01:34:21.405 --> 01:34:23.157
No, no, this isn't the right place.

1644
01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.575
This isn't Olympus.
This is...

1645
01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:26.327
this is the Empire State Building.

1646
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:29.372
Percy! The entrance
to Olympus is there!

1647
01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:31.874
Well, there's ten minutes
till midnight. Let's move.

1648
01:34:31.957 --> 01:34:33.918
LUKE: Percy Jackson!

1649
01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:36.003
(wings fluttering)

1650
01:34:40.675 --> 01:34:43.260
Well, you weren't supposed
to make it out alive.

1651
01:34:44.845 --> 01:34:47.181
I can't let you take
that bolt to Olympus.

1652
01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:50.226
I'm the lightning thief.

1653
01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:53.688
You hid the bolt
in my shield? Why?

1654
01:34:53.771 --> 01:34:58.067
Well, when you said you were
going to the underworld, it hit me.

1655
01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:01.153
That is the perfect opportunity
to get the bolt to Hades.

1656
01:35:01.737 --> 01:35:03.197
Why would you do that?

1657
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.783
To bring Olympus crumbling down.

1658
01:35:06.283 --> 01:35:08.202
SALLY: Percy, let's go.

1659
01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.371
Let's go.

1660
01:35:10.454 --> 01:35:14.500
Well, it's too late, 'cause I'm
returning the bolt to Zeus right now.

1661
01:35:14.583 --> 01:35:16.544
Not before midnight.

1662
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.296
(Luke grunting)

1663
01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.798
(yells, groans)

1664
01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:24.009
(growling)

1665
01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:29.098
(crackles, sizzles)

1666
01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:30.182
(grunting)

1667
01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:32.560
(groaning)

1668
01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:36.564
(fierce yell)

1669
01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:42.445
-(knife whooshing)
-(both grunting)

1670
01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:46.449
(grunts in pain)

1671
01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:52.830
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1672
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:58.002
PERCY: Luke, why do you
want a war of the gods?

1673
01:35:59.044 --> 01:36:00.254
Control.

1674
01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:03.507
They've been in power for too long.

1675
01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:07.136
I say it's time for our generation
to take over,

1676
01:36:07.219 --> 01:36:09.680
remold the world in our image.

1677
01:36:09.764 --> 01:36:11.557
A world of new heroes.

1678
01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.267
You're no hero.

1679
01:36:14.477 --> 01:36:15.603
(Percy and Annabeth gasp)

1680
01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:21.859
(all yell)

1681
01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:23.152
(chuckles)

1682
01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.696
(screaming)

1683
01:36:27.406 --> 01:36:29.283
(yelling, gasping)

1684
01:36:30.326 --> 01:36:31.994
-Mom, are you all right?
-Yeah.

1685
01:36:32.077 --> 01:36:33.579
(whooshing)

1686
01:36:33.662 --> 01:36:35.247
Stay here.

1687
01:36:35.331 --> 01:36:38.292
(panting)

1688
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:51.972
(helicopter approaching)

1689
01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:56.769
(crackling)

1690
01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:57.895
PERCY: Luke!

1691
01:36:58.938 --> 01:37:00.564
(grunting)

1692
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:05.277
Whoa...!

1693
01:37:07.404 --> 01:37:08.697
(growls, yells)

1694
01:37:14.328 --> 01:37:15.871
(yells)

1695
01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:18.916
(fierce grunt)

1696
01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.668
Whoa!

1697
01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:24.964
(boom echoing)

1698
01:37:34.265 --> 01:37:35.266
Whoa!

1699
01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.519
(gasping)

1700
01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:48.529
(yells, grunts)

1701
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:54.702
(grunts)

1702
01:38:06.005 --> 01:38:07.172
(grunts)

1703
01:38:09.967 --> 01:38:11.093
Aah! Oh!

1704
01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:15.514
(gasping)

1705
01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.182
(yelling)

1706
01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.896
No! Oh... oh...!

1707
01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:23.480
(yells, grunting)

1708
01:38:23.564 --> 01:38:25.733
(groaning in pain)

1709
01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:28.527
(spits)

1710
01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.654
(grunts, pants)

1711
01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:36.368
(crackles, sizzles)

1712
01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:41.749
Maybe they were wrong.

1713
01:38:43.542 --> 01:38:45.419
Maybe you're no son of Poseidon.

1714
01:38:50.674 --> 01:38:51.717
Hmm.

1715
01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:52.676
(grunts)

1716
01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.844
(creaking)

1717
01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:55.888
(bolts exploding)

1718
01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:04.563
-(grunts)
-(booming)

1719
01:39:18.535 --> 01:39:20.579
(panting)

1720
01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:24.124
(grunts)

1721
01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.590
(muffled yelling)

1722
01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:33.384
(grunts)

1723
01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:36.345
(electrical crackling)

1724
01:39:46.563 --> 01:39:48.774
(Luke coughing, gagging)

1725
01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:53.278
(spits)

1726
01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:55.614
(panting)

1727
01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.449
(buzzing, crackling)

1728
01:39:57.533 --> 01:39:59.660
(gasping)

1729
01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:05.499
(panting)

1730
01:40:07.376 --> 01:40:10.087
(burbling, whooshing)

1731
01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.296
Yeah.

1732
01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.715
(trident rings)

1733
01:40:12.798 --> 01:40:14.967
I think I am the son of Poseidon.

1734
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:16.677
(both grunt)

1735
01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.429
(grunts, yells)

1736
01:40:19.930 --> 01:40:21.724
Whoa...!

1737
01:40:21.807 --> 01:40:24.518
(bolt crackling)

1738
01:40:27.813 --> 01:40:29.815
(fluttering)

1739
01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:34.486
(sirens wailing in distance)

1740
01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:36.280
(grunts)

1741
01:40:37.573 --> 01:40:41.118
He's got the bolt! Come on!
Let's move! We've got two minutes.

1742
01:40:46.206 --> 01:40:47.499
(electrical whirring)

1743
01:41:00.929 --> 01:41:02.514
(sudden rumbling)

1744
01:41:07.269 --> 01:41:10.189
(high-speed whirring)

1745
01:41:10.272 --> 01:41:11.940
(explosive boom)

1746
01:41:12.024 --> 01:41:14.985
(all panting)

1747
01:41:15.069 --> 01:41:16.945
(thunder rumbles)

1748
01:41:23.994 --> 01:41:24.870
Olympus.

1749
01:41:31.502 --> 01:41:34.755
Percy, I can't get through.
You've got to go!

1750
01:41:44.848 --> 01:41:46.683
(gods arguing)

1751
01:41:52.106 --> 01:41:53.315
Silence!

1752
01:41:53.398 --> 01:41:55.275
(arguments quiet)

1753
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.831
ZEUS:
It is almost midnight.

1754
01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:10.624
This was predestined.

1755
01:42:10.707 --> 01:42:12.251
You wanted this battle!

1756
01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:13.961
You have only yourself to blame!

1757
01:42:14.044 --> 01:42:15.921
ATHENA:
Please!

1758
01:42:16.004 --> 01:42:18.799
Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!

1759
01:42:22.344 --> 01:42:23.846
Time has run out.

1760
01:42:23.929 --> 01:42:25.180
PERCY:
Wait!

1761
01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:27.891
Wait! Wait!

1762
01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.144
Wow.

1763
01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:38.735
My name is Percy Jackson,

1764
01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:41.947
and I think you might be looking for this.

1765
01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:55.377
(bolt sizzling, crackling)

1766
01:42:58.881 --> 01:43:01.425
Give me the bolt, lightning thief.

1767
01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:07.431
(bolt sizzling, crackling)

1768
01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:10.309
(thunder cracking)

1769
01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:15.689
You're wise to betray your father.

1770
01:43:15.772 --> 01:43:17.441
I didn't steal it.

1771
01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:20.027
And I have no connection
to Poseidon.

1772
01:43:21.111 --> 01:43:26.116
But tell me, if you didn't steal it,
then who did?

1773
01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.161
Luke, son of Hermes.

1774
01:43:32.915 --> 01:43:34.750
You see, he was angry at you.

1775
01:43:35.334 --> 01:43:36.668
All of you.

1776
01:43:36.752 --> 01:43:39.922
He wanted you to destroy yourselves.

1777
01:43:50.849 --> 01:43:52.309
You have done well.

1778
01:44:05.530 --> 01:44:07.241
Let there be peace.

1779
01:44:07.741 --> 01:44:09.368
(exhales)

1780
01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:13.038
Hi, Mom.

1781
01:44:14.122 --> 01:44:15.249
Annabeth.

1782
01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:18.001
ATHENA:
I am so proud of you.

1783
01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:24.383
Zeus, I have a good friend.

1784
01:44:24.466 --> 01:44:28.303
He's a satyr named Grover.

1785
01:44:28.387 --> 01:44:30.180
He's my protector.

1786
01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:32.516
And the only reason why
we escaped the underworld

1787
01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.935
is because he stayed behind.

1788
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:39.314
And now you expect me
to bring him back.

1789
01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:43.610
Very well.

1790
01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:46.029
(relieved sigh)

1791
01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:49.950
I believe this assembly's
business here is finished.

1792
01:44:51.743 --> 01:44:53.078
Brother, please.

1793
01:44:54.079 --> 01:44:55.831
I need to speak with him.

1794
01:44:59.334 --> 01:45:01.211
Just this once.

1795
01:45:12.848 --> 01:45:14.683
I'll meet you outside.

1796
01:45:25.319 --> 01:45:27.487
I'm not expecting you to forgive me.

1797
01:45:29.239 --> 01:45:31.700
But I want you to know
that I'm grateful.

1798
01:45:31.783 --> 01:45:33.493
I didn't do it for you.

1799
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:36.163
I did it to save Mom.

1800
01:45:41.877 --> 01:45:44.004
(water rushing)

1801
01:45:44.087 --> 01:45:47.049
Please, we don't have much time.

1802
01:45:50.135 --> 01:45:52.054
How old was I...

1803
01:45:52.137 --> 01:45:53.555
when you left?

1804
01:45:54.389 --> 01:45:55.390
Seven months.

1805
01:45:56.975 --> 01:45:59.811
Look, I didn't need you
there all the time,

1806
01:45:59.895 --> 01:46:01.104
but what...

1807
01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:05.108
I would've liked to have
seen you just once.

1808
01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.364
Why didn't you ever come back?

1809
01:46:15.911 --> 01:46:17.412
I wanted to.

1810
01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.583
When I was with you and your mother,

1811
01:46:21.666 --> 01:46:25.045
I became less concerned
with my responsibilities.

1812
01:46:25.128 --> 01:46:27.255
I was becoming human.

1813
01:46:29.174 --> 01:46:31.051
And that's a bad thing?

1814
01:46:31.134 --> 01:46:33.845
For a god?
Zeus thought so.

1815
01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:35.430
That's why he passed the law

1816
01:46:35.514 --> 01:46:38.558
preventing gods from ever
having contact with their children.

1817
01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:42.187
That was because of you?

1818
01:46:46.525 --> 01:46:48.402
But I was always watching over you.

1819
01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:53.407
Just because you didn't see me
doesn't mean that I wasn't there.

1820
01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:58.036
When you were troubled,
I tried to help.

1821
01:46:59.704 --> 01:47:00.747
I heard you.

1822
01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:05.419
I know I'm not the father
you always wanted.

1823
01:47:05.502 --> 01:47:08.880
But if you ever need me,
I'll be there for you.

1824
01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:10.132
In your thoughts.

1825
01:47:11.133 --> 01:47:13.051
And in your dreams.

1826
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:16.638
I'll stand by you, Percy.

1827
01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:19.182
Always.

1828
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:36.783
(sighs)

1829
01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.794
You can come visit me anytime.

1830
01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:51.173
Just promise me that I don't have to
see that loser Gabe ever again.

1831
01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:52.799
I kicked him out.

1832
01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:56.887
Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.

1833
01:47:57.888 --> 01:47:58.889
Finally.

1834
01:47:58.972 --> 01:47:59.973
(chuckles)

1835
01:48:04.853 --> 01:48:05.854
Oh.

1836
01:48:05.937 --> 01:48:06.938
(sighs)

1837
01:48:07.022 --> 01:48:09.232
-Gonna miss you.
-You, too.

1838
01:48:16.865 --> 01:48:18.033
Percy...

1839
01:48:19.534 --> 01:48:21.036
This is where you belong.

1840
01:48:32.672 --> 01:48:34.007
-Good job, man.
-Nice, Perce.

1841
01:48:35.133 --> 01:48:36.760
Ready!

1842
01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:38.136
Aim!

1843
01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.971
-Whoa, Perce, watch out!
-Whoa, hey!

1844
01:48:40.055 --> 01:48:41.681
Whoa, you guys gonna kill
the man who saved the world?

1845
01:48:41.765 --> 01:48:43.350
Great job. All you guys
take a lunch break.

1846
01:48:43.433 --> 01:48:45.435
Thank you.
(chuckles)

1847
01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:47.354
So the conquering hero
returns triumphant.

1848
01:48:47.437 --> 01:48:48.730
Grover.

1849
01:48:48.813 --> 01:48:51.107
Hey, you notice anything
different about me?

1850
01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:52.192
No.

1851
01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:54.861
You sure?

1852
01:48:54.945 --> 01:48:57.239
Anything that's improved about me?

1853
01:48:57.322 --> 01:48:59.783
No, what?
You've been working out, huh?

1854
01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.118
What, you get a new cologne?
You smell good.

1855
01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:03.828
Look, man, I got my horns!

1856
01:49:03.912 --> 01:49:05.580
Oh! I was seeing them
the whole time.

1857
01:49:05.664 --> 01:49:07.040
-Look at that thing.
-(laughs)

1858
01:49:07.123 --> 01:49:08.375
Got little horns in your head.

1859
01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:10.001
-Right? Zeus came through.
-Crazy.

1860
01:49:10.085 --> 01:49:11.795
-Wow.
-Now I'm Senior Protector,

1861
01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.004
First Class, baby.

1862
01:49:13.088 --> 01:49:15.423
Congratulations.
Definitely earned them.

1863
01:49:15.507 --> 01:49:17.008
Thank you, man.

1864
01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:18.260
-(Grover laughs)
-Yeah.

1865
01:49:18.843 --> 01:49:22.430
CHIRON: Keep moving! Keep moving!
Don't lose interest!

1866
01:49:22.514 --> 01:49:26.685
One foot in front of the other, and
the next thing you know, you're running!

1867
01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:29.896
Percy.

1868
01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:34.651
You left the camp.

1869
01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:36.319
You disobeyed my orders.

1870
01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.990
Yeah, about that. Um...

1871
01:49:40.073 --> 01:49:42.325
Which is why...

1872
01:49:42.409 --> 01:49:44.035
you're my favorite student.

1873
01:49:45.537 --> 01:49:47.622
You can receive
all the training in the world,

1874
01:49:47.706 --> 01:49:51.293
but, ultimately,
you have to follow your instincts.

1875
01:49:51.376 --> 01:49:53.128
Grace under pressure.

1876
01:49:56.631 --> 01:49:58.091
All right.

1877
01:49:58.174 --> 01:50:00.343
Time to train. Go suit up.

1878
01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.387
You might be a big shot
on Olympus,

1879
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:04.806
but down here, you're still
just one of my students.

1880
01:50:05.307 --> 01:50:06.308
Move it.

1881
01:50:09.394 --> 01:50:11.229
Nice horns, Grover.

1882
01:50:11.313 --> 01:50:12.897
-GROVER: I'm serious, man.
-Okay.

1883
01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:15.650
We talked. We wooed. We dined.
We had a great time!

1884
01:50:15.734 --> 01:50:17.110
Well, I'm happy for you, you know.

1885
01:50:17.193 --> 01:50:18.945
Persephone might really
like me. I'm serious.

1886
01:50:24.993 --> 01:50:27.329
I think you can handle
this one on your own.

1887
01:50:27.412 --> 01:50:29.080
Whew. Uh-huh.

1888
01:50:29.164 --> 01:50:30.540
All right, Perce.

1889
01:50:30.624 --> 01:50:32.250
(swords clanging, Annabeth grunting)

1890
01:50:32.334 --> 01:50:33.752
(anxious sigh)

1891
01:50:33.835 --> 01:50:35.003
-Hey, Perce, awesome job.
-Thanks...

1892
01:50:35.086 --> 01:50:36.087
-Good job.
-Thanks.

1893
01:50:36.171 --> 01:50:37.422
Good job, buddy.

1894
01:50:37.505 --> 01:50:40.175
(swords clanging, Annabeth grunting)

1895
01:50:40.258 --> 01:50:41.760
Good job.

1896
01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:48.141
(grunt, thud)

1897
01:50:48.224 --> 01:50:50.518
(groans)

1898
01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:52.354
Who's next?

1899
01:50:57.859 --> 01:51:00.028
I think I'd like to give it a shot.

1900
01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.124
Welcome home.

1901
01:51:19.381 --> 01:51:22.217
Whoa, whoa! Wait!

1902
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.428
First rule of battle strategy:

1903
01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:28.056
don't ever let your opponent distract you.

1904
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.073
(grunting)

1905
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.377

1906

1907
01:53:09.407 --> 01:53:12.035
GABE:
Sally, open the door!

1908
01:53:12.118 --> 01:53:13.870
Open up!

1909
01:53:17.332 --> 01:53:19.167
-You changed the locks?
-Yes.

1910
01:53:20.210 --> 01:53:23.421
So here's your junk.
You can let yourself out.

1911
01:53:25.048 --> 01:53:28.384
How am I supposed to move
all this stuff by myself?

1912
01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:29.677
Deal with it.

1913
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:36.976
I need a beer.

1914
01:53:40.814 --> 01:53:42.065
What?!

1915
01:53:42.148 --> 01:53:43.233
"Do not op..."

1916
01:53:47.403 --> 01:53:48.988
That little brat.

1917
01:53:50.365 --> 01:53:52.158
I may not live here anymore...

1918
01:53:53.409 --> 01:53:55.662
but I'm still the king of this castle.

1919
