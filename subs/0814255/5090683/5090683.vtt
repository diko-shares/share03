00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.909
<i>At first,
I didn't believe it either.</i>

3
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.621
<i>But the gods of
Olympus are real.</i>

4
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.128
<i>And sometimes, these gods
have children with humans...</i>

5
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:20.130
<i>called half-bloods.</i>

6
00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.666
<i>I'm one of them.</i>

7
00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:25.928
<i>I'm Percy Jackson. Son of
Poseidon, god of the sea.</i>

8
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.972
<i>Seven years ago,
four of these children</i>

9
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.725
<i>were headed to
Camp Half-Blood...</i>

10
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.486
<i>the only place on Earth
that is safe for our kind.</i>

11
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:46.239
<i>Only three of them made it.</i>

12
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:55.119
We're almost at camp!

13
00:01:59.161 --> 00:02:00.378
Look out!

14
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.591
Grover! Luke, help him!

15
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.633
Grover, are you okay?

16
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.837
My leg. It's stuck.

17
00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:13.846
Come on. I got you.

18
00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.518
Keep going.
I'll hold them off.

19
00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:18.723
No, Thalia.
They'll kill you.

20
00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.732
Go, Luke. I'll be
right behind you.

21
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.739
Over here!

22
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.320
Annabeth,
come on!

23
00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:37.624
Stay back.

24
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.300
Thalia, come on!

25
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:53.341
No! Thalia!

26
00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:02.816
<i>Her name was Thalia, and
she gave her life to save three.</i>

27
00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.154
<i>And so, as Thalia lay dying...</i>

28
00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:15.617
<i>her father Zeus found
another way for her to live.</i>

29
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.010
<i>A way for all
half-bloods to live.</i>

30
00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:37.051
<i>A gift to ensure no one in Camp
Half-Blood would die the same way.</i>

31
00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:43.899
<i>The barrier, to protect them from
those who lived for their death.</i>

32
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.022
Let's go!

33
00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:55.115
<i>Every day, the story of
Thalia's bravery inspires me.</i>

34
00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.620
<i>And her tree protects my home.</i>

35
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.291
<i>But not always my head.</i>

36
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.844
How nice of you to show up
just to watch me win.

37
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:19.851
Everything they say about
you is wrong, Clarisse.

38
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.978
You actually do
have a sense of humor.

39
00:04:30.854 --> 00:04:32.151
There goes another one.

40
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.569
Go, Percy!

41
00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:37.531
Come on, Percy!
I got 50 drachma on you!

42
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.905
You bet on this?

43
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.744
What, is that wrong?

44
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:45.869
Oh!

45
00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.748
'97 Xinomavro.
Would you like a taste?

46
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:53.545
Why do you torture
yourself, Dionysus?

47
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.389
it was one
transgression, one.

48
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.051
And with a naiad,
for the sake of Olympus.

49
00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:03.266
How was I to know that
Zeus had a thing for her?

50
00:05:03.345 --> 00:05:06.690
Or that he could
hold a grudge for so long?

51
00:05:10.227 --> 00:05:13.606
I think the fact
that Zeus is immortal...

52
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.862
means there's no limit to how
long he can hold a grudge.

53
00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.949
The Christians have a guy who
can do this trick in reverse.

54
00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:21.701
Now, that's a god.

55
00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.417
Aren't you tired of
getting beat, Jackson?

56
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.725
Clarisse!

57
00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:53.111
Help!
Help me!

58
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.458
Tereus, grab my hand!

59
00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:13.130
Good luck with that.

60
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:15.675
I got you.

61
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.472
Thank you!

62
00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:26.803
Percy!

63
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.491
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!

64
00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.831
So, what I'm
wondering is, Percy...

65
00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.965
that first quest you went on,
beginner's luck, wasn't it?

66
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:59.670
Clarisse, he saved Olympus.
That's more than you've ever done.

67
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:02.888
Whatever.

68
00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:05.267
Even for the daughter of the god
of war, that girl's a mythic bi--

69
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:06.559
Don't listen
to her, Percy.

70
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.353
You know,
it's too late.

71
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.730
Besides, she has a point.

72
00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:12.482
Dude, what are
you talking about?

73
00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.651
You're more than
a one-quest wonder.

74
00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.820
You recovered
Ares' stolen chariot.

75
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.193
No, actually,
that was Clarisse.

76
00:07:19.356 --> 00:07:21.700
Okay, what about the Fall Tournament?
You owned that sucker.

77
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:22.776
Mmm-mmm.

78
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.907
Clarisse?
Mmm-hmm.

79
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.865
Okay, the Solstice Games?
The Bronze Dragon's Quest?

80
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.838
Thank you for
trying to cheer me up.

81
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.752
I would lick a pair
of cloven hooves...

82
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.799
before I let you listen to
Clarisse instead of us.

83
00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:39.876
No offense, Grover.

84
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.803
None taken.
Is that an offer?

85
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:44.176
Listen, it doesn't matter
what Clarisse has done.

86
00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.633
To Chiron and Mr. D,
you're still the rock star.

87
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:48.514
Perry Johnson!

88
00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.055
Actually, it's
Percy Jackson, sir.

89
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.222
Whatever.

90
00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:55.063
I have a very important task
to entrust you with.

91
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.188
You do?

92
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:59.271
Yes, it's a critical assignment.
And it's very taxing.

93
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:00.606
Can I trust you?

94
00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:01.690
Of course.

95
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:03.867
Good. You'll need this.

96
00:08:06.069 --> 00:08:10.370
Sometimes these events
get a little messy.

97
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.917
<i>Maybe Clarisse was right.</i>

98
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.764
Maybe I only stopped Luke
from destroying Olympus...

99
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:28.934
because I had Annabeth and
Grover helping me, right?

100
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:33.013
Dad?

101
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.932
Poseidon?

102
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:48.362
Have you ever felt like
everything you've ever done...

103
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.530
maybe you didn't
really do it?

104
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.829
It was all just
luck or something?

105
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.621
No, of course not.

106
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.335
You're a god.

107
00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:06.634
Speaking as someone
who's not, it sucks.

108
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.849
It makes you question whether you
were all that good to begin with.

109
00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:22.024
Okay. Good not talking to you.

110
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:23.692
Again.

111
00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:38.336
So, he just walked right in? He
just walked straight into camp?

112
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.413
It seems he lumbered,
actually.

113
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.582
I don't care if
he sashayed!

114
00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:44.467
What's the point of
having this mystical

115
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.302
protective barrier if
any thing can just--

116
00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:47.720
Could you not
touch that, please?

117
00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:49.214
That's a very
precious Grenache.

118
00:09:49.297 --> 00:09:50.298
I think the point is...

119
00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.510
since he did pass right through
the barrier from Thalia's tree...

120
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.188
Don't say it. ...it means
he's most likely a god-spawn.

121
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.943
Yeah, but the spawn
of which god?

122
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.854
I know.

123
00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:09.404
Poseidon.

124
00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.791
So, why did Mr. D summon you?
It's not good to get summoned.

125
00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.171
I'm sure it's fine.

126
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:27.673
I'm sure you don't get
summoned to the Big House

127
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.049
without a major-league
screw-up.

128
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:30.301
I didn't screw up.

129
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.803
I cleaned the entire
coliseum. And vacuumed.

130
00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:34.884
Don't let him get
into your head, okay?

131
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:37.847
We have a dead camper walking.
Dead camper walking, here.

132
00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.772
Thanks. This
is friendship.

133
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.808
I'm just playing, just
trying to have a little fun.

134
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.143
It's all right.

135
00:10:43.309 --> 00:10:45.357
So, it's okay if I get your
cabin when you get kicked out?

136
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.814
Seriously, don't worry.
It's just Mr. D.

137
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:51.117
I mean, if Chiron had
summoned you, then...

138
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.911
Oh, you are so
massively screwed.

139
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.663
Whatever it is you think
I did, I didn't do it.

140
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.331
You've done
nothing, Percy.

141
00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:05.631
Exactly.

142
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.261
As you know, you are believed
to be Poseidon's only heir.

143
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.137
Yeah, so?

144
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:16.427
So, it would seem that belief
has been held in error.

145
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.678
Hold on. You're saying
Percy has a brother?

146
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.308
Or a sister.

147
00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:26.111
Holy Styx. Another
Poseidon half-blood.

148
00:11:27.478 --> 00:11:28.946
Not exactly.

149
00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.609
Technically,
Tyson is not a half-blood.

150
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.028
Half-bloods are half-human,
hence the name.

151
00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.363
I don't get it.

152
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.746
If this new kid is not half-human,
then what other half is he?

153
00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.043
Nymph. Sea nymph.

154
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.375
And when you cross a deity
with a nymph, you get...

155
00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:47.128
Don't touch.
It's a Gewurztraminer.

156
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.542
Hi.

157
00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.628
Hi, Brother.

158
00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.278
So, you're the big shot here, right?
You saved the world and stuff.

159
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.489
Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:24.669
Hey, they put peppers in yours.
Are you gonna eat that?

161
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.042
Go ahead.

162
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.798
Is he messing with me?

163
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.258
I think he's hungry.

164
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.385
No, not him.
I meant Poseidon.

165
00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:38.424
Is this supposed to be
some kind of joke?

166
00:12:38.508 --> 00:12:41.853
A half-brother?
A Cyclops? Come on.

167
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.980
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

168
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.609
And a half-brother
is better than nothing.

169
00:12:48.685 --> 00:12:50.107
I like having a brother.

170
00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:51.813
Dad was cool
to bring me here.

171
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:54.194
Dad? Dad brought you here?
Uh-huh.

172
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.280
I was upstate,
in the woods.

173
00:12:56.359 --> 00:13:00.580
One day, this trident shows up over my
head, and then it started moving south.

174
00:13:00.655 --> 00:13:04.205
And you followed it.
You followed it here.

175
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:06.210
It glowed.

176
00:13:06.369 --> 00:13:09.418
Well, somebody has
got a new brother.

177
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:12.838
And I can see he's
got his daddy's eyes.

178
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.002
Well...

179
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.712
"Eye."

180
00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.224
You should really get him
some sprayable mist.

181
00:13:19.757 --> 00:13:23.432
Anyway, it is kind of interesting
timing, don't you think?

182
00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:28.566
Maybe Poseidon decided he needed
another son to, you know...

183
00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:29.851
represent.

184
00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.395
Bull.

185
00:13:31.728 --> 00:13:33.025
Excuse me?

186
00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.530
Smells like bull.

187
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.743
We got barrier action.

188
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.084
Hey, Chris, you coming?

189
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.419
No, I'm good.

190
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:04.932
That is so awesome.

191
00:14:06.888 --> 00:14:09.641
It's chill.
The barrier is holding.

192
00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:19.821
A Colchis bull.

193
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.118
Run!

194
00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.166
Percy!

195
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.339
Come on!

196
00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:07.036
We have to find its weak spot.
Does it have one?

197
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:09.163
Percy, distract
it for me.

198
00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.083
Hey!

199
00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:18.835
Hey!

200
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:52.373
I got this.

201
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.667
Bad bull.

202
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:39.753
Hey, rust bucket!

203
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.255
Damn it, Jackson.

204
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:08.259
Do you have any idea how hard
Colchis bulls are to come by?

205
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.887
Maybe next time
you try to drown someone...

206
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:17.856
you'll first make sure he's
not a demigod who can swim.

207
00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.277
Luke?

208
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.903
Turns out, you're not the only
half-blood who's hard to kill.

209
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:32.696
You know, prophecy.

210
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.954
What prophecy? What are
you talking about?

211
00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.618
You don't know?

212
00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:40.415
Huh.

213
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:45.463
Add that to the long list of things your
buddy Chiron hasn't shared with you.

214
00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:49.591
Chiron, Mr. D, all the rest...

215
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.719
they don't care about us.

216
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.059
To them, we're just kids.

217
00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:59.518
A bunch of pawns meant to be
pushed around, told what to do.

218
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:02.358
I'm not the only half-blood
who thinks so.

219
00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.566
Think about it.

220
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:21.328
What did I miss?

221
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.627
Where's Percy?

222
00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:25.832
Last time I saw him, he was getting
dragged by a Colchis bull.

223
00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:27.792
Hey, you.

224
00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:29.552
How come you aren't barbecued?

225
00:19:29.627 --> 00:19:31.220
Cyclopes are fireproof.

226
00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:33.764
How did the bull get
through the barrier?

227
00:19:35.257 --> 00:19:37.100
Oh, my gods.

228
00:19:59.907 --> 00:20:01.250
Poisoned.

229
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:03.332
Is she...
ls the tree dead?

230
00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:05.121
No, but dying.

231
00:20:08.374 --> 00:20:11.503
A condition we're about to
become all too familiar with.

232
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:16.007
Everybody, we're going to need a guard
detail to patrol the perimeter.

233
00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.097
It feels like she's
dying all over again.

234
00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:22.271
Who would do this?

235
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:24.982
Luke poisoned the tree.

236
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.105
Percy!

237
00:20:27.435 --> 00:20:29.233
Yay, you're alive.

238
00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.156
Yeah, I'm not
the only one.

239
00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:34.275
Luke let the bull in.

240
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.864
Without the
tree's barrier...

241
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:37.979
he probably figures there's
enough demi-Titans

242
00:20:38.005 --> 00:20:39.563
out there to get
him what he wants.

243
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:41.832
And that would
be what, exactly?

244
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.244
Our annihilation,
Ms. La Rue.

245
00:20:45.703 --> 00:20:47.876
Our annihilation.

246
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.465
How's the antidote coming?

247
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.845
Slowly.

248
00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:02.679
I know this probably
isn't the best time...

249
00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.482
but there's something
I have to ask you.

250
00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:07.934
What is it?

251
00:21:09.894 --> 00:21:12.522
It was something Luke
said about a prophecy...

252
00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:14.690
how I'm mentioned in it.

253
00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:17.577
Do you know anything
about this?

254
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.122
Knowledge isn't
always power, Percy.

255
00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.913
Sometimes, it's a burden.

256
00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:27.127
I know that.

257
00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:31.127
But like you said, I've been
pretty unexceptional lately.

258
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:35.383
It's got me wondering
if I'm prophecy-worthy.

259
00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:37.842
They say that when the gods
wish to torture us...

260
00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:39.720
they answer our prayers.

261
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:43.557
Necklace of Harmonia,
Hercules' bow, Golden Apple of Discord.

262
00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.521
Three millennia of
gods and demigods...

263
00:21:45.596 --> 00:21:48.691
you'd think that someone would have
come up with a cure for Thalia's tree.

264
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:52.487
Persephone did come up with
Miracle-Gro. Maybe we can try that.

265
00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:53.942
That's it.

266
00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:56.490
Right here.

267
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.995
That is not gonna cure Thalia's
tree so much as get us all killed.

268
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.322
Me, in particular.

269
00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:05.248
It's perfect. It's
exactly what we need.

270
00:22:06.742 --> 00:22:08.210
I'm taking this to Mr. D.

271
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.411
No.

272
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:19.006
I was hoping to spare you this onus a
little while longer, but go inside.

273
00:22:19.088 --> 00:22:20.590
Upstairs, to the attic.

274
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:23.176
And when you come back down,
we'll talk some more.

275
00:22:23.259 --> 00:22:26.012
Assuming you're
still sane, that is.

276
00:22:59.003 --> 00:23:01.472
I am the spirit of Delphi...

277
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.474
speaker of the prophecies
of Phoebus Apollo...

278
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:06.977
slayer of the mighty Python.

279
00:23:07.136 --> 00:23:10.811
Approach, seeker, and ask.

280
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:15.611
I heard there was
a prophecy about me.

281
00:23:15.769 --> 00:23:17.146
Aye.

282
00:23:17.313 --> 00:23:22.160
But before you learn the
future, know first the past.

283
00:23:24.028 --> 00:23:27.498
<i>Long ago, before our time...</i>

284
00:23:27.656 --> 00:23:29.704
<i>before Olympus and the gods...</i>

285
00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:33.167
<i>Titans ruled the world.</i>

286
00:23:33.704 --> 00:23:35.456
<i>Led by Kronos...</i>

287
00:23:35.623 --> 00:23:40.049
<i>a force so evil,
he devoured his own children.</i>

288
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.713
<i>But three of his sons escaped.</i>

289
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.180
<i>Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.</i>

290
00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.773
<i>They destroyed Kronos...</i>

291
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:57.479
<i>and banished his remains
to the depths of Tartarus.</i>

292
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:02.363
<i>But Kronos is
fated to rise again...</i>

293
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:07.280
<i>to exact his vengeance on
Olympus, and the world.</i>

294
00:24:09.073 --> 00:24:14.375
<i>Only one half-blood child of the
three eldest gods can defeat him.</i>

295
00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:17.790
<i>This child shall
be our salvation...</i>

296
00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:21.131
<i>or the cause of
our destruction.</i>

297
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:28.385
<i>It all begins when two cousins
grapple for a fleece...</i>

298
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:31.763
<i>the son of the sea
and the lightning thief.</i>

299
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:33.722
Luke.

300
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.392
And that half-blood
of the eldest gods...

301
00:24:36.558 --> 00:24:39.562
shall reach 20
against all odds.

302
00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:42.982
"And see the world
in endless sleep...

303
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.948
"the evil soul,
cursed blade shall reap.

304
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:48.988
"A single choice
shall end his days...

305
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:52.450
"Olympus to preserve or raze."

306
00:24:52.616 --> 00:24:56.086
And that is "raze" with a "Z,"
as in "destroy."

307
00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:58.080
I asked.

308
00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:04.462
Is there any chance,
any chance at all...

309
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:07.928
that I might not be
the guy in the prophecy?

310
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.934
The Oracle references a
half-blood of the eldest gods.

311
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:16.141
You are the only living half-blood
heir of Zeus, Hades or Poseidon.

312
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:18.650
The prophecy could
refer only to you.

313
00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:22.439
What if I destroy Olympus...

314
00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.778
by not being good
enough to save it?

315
00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:29.286
That seems to be
the question, doesn't it?

316
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:32.243
It's absolutely
out of the question.

317
00:25:32.322 --> 00:25:34.074
If you could just listen
to me for one moment--

318
00:25:34.158 --> 00:25:36.126
lam listening.
You want to go on a quest.

319
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.544
Oh! It must be Thursday.

320
00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:40.418
I'm serious. I'm absolutely
sure that this is gonna work.

321
00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.551
It was such a good year.

322
00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.338
The Golden Fleece can heal any
living person or thing...

323
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.765
including Thalia's tree.

324
00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:53.097
We heal the tree, we restore
the barrier around camp.

325
00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.434
I'm surprised you want to go along
with her on this, Mr. Undershirt.

326
00:25:56.513 --> 00:25:57.514
Underwood.

327
00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:58.770
Whatever.

328
00:25:59.141 --> 00:26:02.611
Every satyr who has ever gone
after the Fleece has died.

329
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.273
Right?
I mentioned that to her.

330
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:09.911
But it's a risk I'm willing to
take for the good of the camp.

331
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.913
Look, the last I heard...

332
00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:15.746
the Golden Fleece
was in the Sea of Monsters...

333
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:17.918
what the humans call
the Bermuda Triangle.

334
00:26:17.993 --> 00:26:20.416
A place not only a satyr
should be afraid of.

335
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:24.217
So, the answer is no. No.
I'm sorry, Annabelle.

336
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.292
Annabeth.

337
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.554
Whatever.
It's a terrible idea.

338
00:26:28.712 --> 00:26:31.181
I've had a grand idea.

339
00:26:33.008 --> 00:26:35.477
Unless Thalia's
tree can be cured...

340
00:26:35.636 --> 00:26:39.812
and the protective barrier
around our camp restored...

341
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:43.648
then every demigod, centaur,
satyr and nymph...

342
00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:46.522
will be killed within days,
if not sooner.

343
00:26:46.605 --> 00:26:48.323
Hey, you okay?

344
00:26:48.941 --> 00:26:51.444
Don't worry,
camp will be okay.

345
00:26:52.027 --> 00:26:53.904
You have to have faith, right?

346
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:56.615
But fortunately,
I have considered the matter.

347
00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:58.367
And after great study...

348
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.077
I have determined
that the only thing

349
00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.795
that has the power to
save Thalia's tree...

350
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.622
and therefore our home...

351
00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.753
is the Golden
Fleece of myth...

352
00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:09.299
What?

353
00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:11.259
...whose touch...

354
00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:17.303
...can heal every person
and every thing.

355
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:22.896
So, a quest, a mission
of mercy, if you will...

356
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.527
into uncharted
and deadly waters...

357
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.943
with nothing less at stake
than our own survival.

358
00:27:29.565 --> 00:27:35.243
Now, a satyr is naturally drawn, as
you know, to the power of the Fleece.

359
00:27:35.404 --> 00:27:39.500
And therefore, it must be a satyr who
will guide a half-blood on this quest.

360
00:27:39.825 --> 00:27:41.327
Thanks a lot.

361
00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:42.870
Ichneutae!

362
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.668
Will you guide
the champion?

363
00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:47.549
Oh, yeah.

364
00:27:47.708 --> 00:27:50.552
Good. Great! That's great!

365
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.921
Yeah!

366
00:27:55.883 --> 00:28:00.935
As to who that champion might be, our
plight calls for only our finest hero.

367
00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:05.852
The best of us, the
strongest and the bravest.

368
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:09.522
The scion of the god of war...

369
00:28:09.688 --> 00:28:10.735
Clarisse!

370
00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:12.316
Yes!

371
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.161
Thank you.

372
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.157
Her name, he gets right.

373
00:28:25.037 --> 00:28:27.165
Hey, Clarisse.
Clarisse!

374
00:28:27.331 --> 00:28:29.049
What? Oh.

375
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:31.547
Don't worry about always
coming in second, Jackson.

376
00:28:31.627 --> 00:28:33.220
You do get used to it.

377
00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:35.343
I think, right? Obviously,
I wouldn't know.

378
00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:36.639
Listen, Luke
is still out there.

379
00:28:36.715 --> 00:28:39.138
He's involved with
the Fleece somehow...

380
00:28:39.426 --> 00:28:41.975
and I've got a feeling
that he's not done yet.

381
00:28:42.054 --> 00:28:43.055
Really?

382
00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.899
Because I've got a feeling
that I don't really care.

383
00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:47.817
Gosh, don't look so wounded.

384
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:51.317
Listen, there are generals,
and there are foot soldiers.

385
00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:54.570
And you should feel lucky that you
even made it into the army at all.

386
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.245
Just try not to screw up anything
too badly while I'm gone. Okay?

387
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.451
Let's go.

388
00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:12.926
"Cursed blade shall reap."

389
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:16.631
"Cursed blade shall reap."

390
00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:21.723
What good is a prophecy if you
can't even understand it?

391
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.892
I guess you don't have
any answers either, Dad.

392
00:29:29.351 --> 00:29:31.024
This was your sword.

393
00:29:43.365 --> 00:29:44.366
This is a bad idea.

394
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.746
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

395
00:29:45.826 --> 00:29:48.329
You were going to say that you're going
after the Fleece to save the camp.

396
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:50.915
Actually, he was
gonna say "we" were.

397
00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:54.301
Look, I get what
you're doing here.

398
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.006
You're worried about
the one-quest wonder thing...

399
00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.804
and you want to
make your bones.

400
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:00.052
But Ichneutae and Clarisse are
already going after the Fleece...

401
00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.510
and it's not cool to bogart
on someone else's quest.

402
00:30:02.592 --> 00:30:04.390
I think this is
my quest, too.

403
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:06.267
The Oracle says he wrestles
Luke for the Fleece.

404
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:09.646
"Grapples."
But she also said...

405
00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:13.813
that I'm destined to destroy
Olympus, or save it.

406
00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:19.280
Saving is better,
obviously.

407
00:30:19.443 --> 00:30:20.911
Yeah.

408
00:30:21.778 --> 00:30:25.248
Let me pack a bag and make sure
my health insurance is paid up.

409
00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:43.008
How are we gonna
get past them?

410
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.098
I think they're looking for
threats trying to come in...

411
00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:47.600
not people trying
to sneak out...

412
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:50.232
so, I think we're cool
<i>as</i> long as we stay quiet.

413
00:30:52.768 --> 00:30:53.769
Sorry!

414
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.521
Shh!

415
00:30:58.106 --> 00:30:59.278
We're...

416
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:02.152
We're guarding, too.

417
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:04.620
You left without me.

418
00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:07.449
Tyson, where we're going,
it's very dangerous.

419
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:09.038
I know. I'm not stupid.

420
00:31:09.117 --> 00:31:10.460
No, just dumb.

421
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.045
I want to help.

422
00:31:13.497 --> 00:31:14.965
You'd do it for me.

423
00:31:15.123 --> 00:31:16.670
I appreciate that...

424
00:31:16.833 --> 00:31:20.713
but I don't think you understand exactly
how dangerous this is going to be.

425
00:31:20.796 --> 00:31:21.968
I do.

426
00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.098
The Fleece is
guarded by Polyphemus.

427
00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:25.558
Who?

428
00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:26.806
Polyphemus.

429
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:29.642
Closest thing Cyclopes
have got to someone famous.

430
00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:33.021
Captured Odysseus.
Lives in Circeland.

431
00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:34.685
Wait, Circeland?

432
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.821
Built on his island.
Long story.

433
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.152
Point is, maybe
I can talk to him.

434
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.317
You know,
Cyclops to Cyclops.

435
00:31:42.484 --> 00:31:45.408
No, you can't, because I'm
not going with a Cyclops.

436
00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:50.079
Then we got a problem, because
I'm not going without one.

437
00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:54.588
This Polyphemus is probably what killed
every satyr that's gone near the Fleece.

438
00:31:54.663 --> 00:31:56.631
You want me to lead
you to a Cyclops? Fine.

439
00:31:56.706 --> 00:32:00.006
But I'm bringing along one
of my own, for protection.

440
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:01.921
No way.

441
00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:03.380
No.

442
00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:13.269
What do you think's gonna
attract more attention...

443
00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:14.941
all the noise
or the one eye?

444
00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:17.018
Just give the guy
a break, okay?

445
00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:19.695
Okay, fine.

446
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:20.772
Shh! Keep it down.

447
00:32:20.856 --> 00:32:23.109
This is crazy
hard to come by...

448
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:25.277
and I only brought it along
in case of an emergency...

449
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.615
which I guess this is an
emergency, so... here.

450
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.247
Mist?

451
00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.458
It makes the mystical
look normal.

452
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:37.756
"Side effects may include
handsomeness, headache,

453
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:39.674
"self-esteem and
low self-esteem."

454
00:32:39.749 --> 00:32:41.672
And just know that if the
camp wasn't in danger...

455
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:43.128
I wouldn't be
wasting this on you.

456
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:44.588
Wasting what?

457
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:50.060
It's not gonna last forever.
You're gonna have to reapply it.

458
00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:01.147
Extreme makeover alert.
Whoop, whoop!

459
00:33:04.065 --> 00:33:05.408
How do I look?

460
00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:09.117
A bit like Dad, actually.

461
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.281
He's still a Cyclops.

462
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.245
Grover, where are we going?
What does your nose say?

463
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.831
Uh, somewhere off the
coast of Florida. South.

464
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.047
Over here.

465
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.678
Annie! Hey!

466
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.728
It's the Chariot
of Damnation.

467
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:43.022
Looks like
a New York City cab.

468
00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:44.565
Same difference.

469
00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:49.532
No dollars, no credit cards.
Drachmas only.

470
00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.492
Exact... Change... Please.

471
00:33:51.655 --> 00:33:53.328
Chop, chop!
Get in the cab.

472
00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:56.285
We just had this cab sanitized
for your protection.

473
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.794
It wasn't this year, though.

474
00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:00.042
Excuse me, we're trying
to get to Florida.

475
00:34:00.121 --> 00:34:02.624
Our kind
of fare. Pricey.

476
00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.921
Whoa!

477
00:34:08.004 --> 00:34:10.803
<i>Hey, there. This is Ganymede,
cupbearer to Zeus.</i>

478
00:34:10.966 --> 00:34:13.344
<i>And when I'm out buying wine
for the lord of the skies...</i>

479
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:15.303
<i>I always remember
to buckle up.</i>

480
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:17.685
Maybe we should
have flown commercial.

481
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.192
Look out!

482
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:26.444
Calm down. If we didn't
know what we were doing...

483
00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.196
We wouldn't be licensed.

484
00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:32.658
They don't have eyes.

485
00:34:33.613 --> 00:34:34.865
Yeah.

486
00:34:36.491 --> 00:34:38.585
I know, awful picture.
Bad hair day.

487
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:40.082
We do so have an eye.

488
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:41.834
It's around
here somewhere.

489
00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:43.165
The last time I
saw it, you put it

490
00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:44.583
in the glove compartment,
Anger.

491
00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:46.088
Don't use that
tone with my name.

492
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.965
It's not there this time.

493
00:34:48.044 --> 00:34:49.045
Ah!

494
00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.682
Wasp always puts
it with the keys.

495
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.555
And it's 20/20.

496
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.019
So is mine!

497
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:58.271
Shouldn't the driver
get the eye?

498
00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.020
She'll be fine.

499
00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:06.650
Tempest, split!

500
00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:13.570
Percy!

501
00:35:16.448 --> 00:35:18.371
We paid extra for that option.

502
00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.582
The kid is right. The driver
should have the eyeball.

503
00:35:25.665 --> 00:35:26.882
He's a freaking genius!

504
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.426
You're the one that
put it in the visor.

505
00:35:28.501 --> 00:35:31.471
While it's on the table, I haven't
had a turn in quite some time.

506
00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:34.925
Oh, no, you didn't!

507
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:36.263
Yes, I did.

508
00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:40.939
Hands on the wheel
at least, okay?

509
00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.444
We're all gonna die!
Pipe down.

510
00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:49.864
Didn't that prophecy say you're
gonna make it till at least 20?

511
00:35:49.939 --> 00:35:51.031
You know about the prophecy?

512
00:35:51.107 --> 00:35:52.859
Oh, sure.
The Oracle is a friend.

513
00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:54.819
- We're besties.
B-F-F!

514
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.321
Ugh!

515
00:35:56.404 --> 00:35:57.656
Eye! Eye! Eye!

516
00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:59.745
Gross! Get it off me!

517
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:04.921
What do you know
about the prophecy?

518
00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:07.874
No!

519
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:12.295
Okay, okay.

520
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:19.345
30, 31, 75, 12.

521
00:36:19.511 --> 00:36:20.512
What?

522
00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:23.356
Percy, you got
your answer!

523
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.024
All I got were numbers.

524
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.568
Yes.
You'll know...

525
00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:28.399
When it matters.

526
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:33.362
I think we're a little
short on drachmas.

527
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:34.442
What?

528
00:36:46.955 --> 00:36:48.332
What do you... think we're...
running here?

529
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.382
A charity?

530
00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:50.959
- Get your cheap butts...
- Out!

531
00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:02.595
That was...

532
00:37:02.762 --> 00:37:03.979
I know.

533
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:07.483
Awesome!
Can we go again?

534
00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:09.770
We're definitely
not in Florida.

535
00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:13.323
I think we're in Olympus.

536
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.240
Hail to you, great Zeus! Forgive
our trespass on Olympus.

537
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:20.076
We're seeking
transport to Florida.

538
00:37:20.822 --> 00:37:21.823
Zeus?

539
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.491
Zeus?

540
00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:24.993
Zeus?

541
00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.209
Whoa, stop it, stop it, stop it!
This isn't Olympus, okay?

542
00:37:28.288 --> 00:37:29.915
This is the
Capitol building.

543
00:37:29.998 --> 00:37:32.842
We're in Washington,
D.C. Okay?

544
00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:34.586
Oh.

545
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.258
It looks like Olympus.

546
00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:39.261
Right down to the dudes with power
who only care about themselves.

547
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.217
We need
to find a bus station.

548
00:37:41.301 --> 00:37:42.928
First we need
to get some money.

549
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:50.939
<i>Hey, there, valued
half-blood account holder!</i>

550
00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:52.862
<i>Sign up for our new Aphrodite
Express credit card---</i>

551
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.063
And you can--

552
00:37:54.147 --> 00:37:58.197
Can I get four venti
half-caf no-whip lattes?

553
00:37:58.359 --> 00:38:01.158
And an extra shot of nectar.

554
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.411
Nectar?

555
00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:11.339
If you haven't had, then
you haven't lived, buddy.

556
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:19.385
Hecatonshire.

557
00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:21.140
Hey.
Whoa.

558
00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:23.806
I see you got
your hands full.

559
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:27.897
Room for cream?

560
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:31.067
Nectar. Double shot.

561
00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:41.194
I've lived.

562
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.539
This might be the most fun
I've ever had.

563
00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:45.869
Even

564
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:49.582
Yeah, anything's gotta be better
than living in the woods, right?

565
00:38:49.702 --> 00:38:52.171
Living in the woods would have
been fine if you were there.

566
00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.420
Everything's better
with a brother.

567
00:38:55.333 --> 00:38:58.007
You know, technically,
we don't have the same mom.

568
00:38:58.086 --> 00:39:01.716
So we're still brothers!
I know! How cool is that?

569
00:39:01.881 --> 00:39:03.258
Arctic.

570
00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.352
It's too sweet,
don't you think?

571
00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.771
No, nectar's
never too sweet.

572
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:14.853
Get off me!

573
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:17.113
Get off me!
Grover!

574
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.413
Percy!

575
00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:34.460
Damn!
Was that Chris Rodriguez?

576
00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.374
How did they do that?

577
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.425
Back at camp, Luke said that there
were other half-bloods who turned.

578
00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:43.302
What do you mean,
"turned"?

579
00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:45.509
To his side.

580
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.720
Luke has Grover.

581
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:51.647
The Oracle was right.

582
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:55.106
Luke is going after the Fleece.
That's why he needs a satyr.

583
00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.233
But what does Luke want
with the Fleece anyway?

584
00:39:57.312 --> 00:39:58.404
I don't know.

585
00:39:58.479 --> 00:40:00.652
But if we're gonna get Grover
back, we need to find Luke.

586
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:02.075
But we don't know
where he is.

587
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.783
I know someone who does.
Come on.

588
00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:20.210
What, are we shipping ourselves overnight
express to the Sea of Monsters?

589
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:23.467
You want to find Luke?
His dad will know where he is.

590
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.144
Olympic Parcel Service.
Come on.

591
00:40:33.306 --> 00:40:36.526
Like it? He'll love it. Yes,
Hephaestus does do quality work.

592
00:40:36.643 --> 00:40:38.441
Everyone else
these days, hacks.

593
00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:40.237
Excuse me, we're
looking for Hermes.

594
00:40:40.313 --> 00:40:43.283
I'm sorry to be the god of
obviousness, but I'm with a customer.

595
00:40:43.358 --> 00:40:46.737
You want an overnight shipment to
Hades, that will be 250 drachmas.

596
00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:49.702
Perfect.
Thank you, sweetness.

597
00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:53.209
I will take care of that for
you, and I'll see you next week.

598
00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.328
Now, you.

599
00:40:55.495 --> 00:40:57.088
You are here about Hermes?

600
00:40:57.163 --> 00:40:59.040
His son, actually.
It's kind of important.

601
00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:01.967
Yeah, I could tell the way you
burst in here, all rude-like.

602
00:41:02.043 --> 00:41:03.545
His son's name
is Luke Castellan.

603
00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:10.726
What has that wayward boy of
mine gotten himself into now?

604
00:41:11.219 --> 00:41:13.017
Wait, you're...

605
00:41:13.096 --> 00:41:14.143
Hermes.

606
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.524
Little insulted
you didn't recognize me.

607
00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:19.944
My feelings might have even been hurt if
I wasn't such a self-confident individual.

608
00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:22.067
I don't know if you noticed,
but I'm killing these shorts.

609
00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.238
Sir, we're looking
for Luke...

610
00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.487
because he attacked Camp Half-Blood
and kidnapped our friend.

611
00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:28.319
And we really need your help, and
we don't have a lot of time.

612
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:31.623
That's really cute, how you
finish each other's sentences.

613
00:41:32.865 --> 00:41:33.957
Follow.

614
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.880
You like this tie? I just bought it.
Hermés, of course.

615
00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:40.464
Check it out.

616
00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.134
State-of-the-art sorting,
processing and packaging facility.

617
00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:45.962
If you can box it, we can
ship it at the speed of...

618
00:41:46.045 --> 00:41:47.638
Well, me.

619
00:41:47.797 --> 00:41:49.299
We have plans to
expand next year.

620
00:41:49.424 --> 00:41:50.892
We're finding we have
some space issues.

621
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.765
So picture this,
only bigger.

622
00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:53.970
Don't touch that.

623
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:56.147
We're the fastest-growing
Olympian industry.

624
00:41:56.222 --> 00:41:57.439
It took a while to
get up and running,

625
00:41:57.598 --> 00:41:58.850
but Rome wasn't
built in a day.

626
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:00.230
Trust me, I was there.

627
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:02.653
Excuse me, sir, we're
in a bit of a hurry.

628
00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:04.481
Relax, my friend.
Take it slow.

629
00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:06.862
Oh, come on!
Give me a break!

630
00:42:07.025 --> 00:42:09.744
Easy for you
to say, Your Eminence.

631
00:42:09.902 --> 00:42:11.779
Actually, Martha,
it's not easy for him.

632
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:13.747
He's the god of
freaking speed.

633
00:42:13.823 --> 00:42:18.454
Except he's not the one whose butt is
stuck to a big silver stick forever!

634
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:21.122
Hey. guys, what did <i>I</i> say?

635
00:42:21.289 --> 00:42:23.471
When we meet new people,
protract your S's.

636
00:42:23.497 --> 00:42:24.488
It's more dramatic.

637
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.010
Makes an impression.

638
00:42:26.127 --> 00:42:29.222
Ugh! I'm personally insulted.
Snakes don't talk like that.

639
00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.550
It is a stereotype
and it's offensive.

640
00:42:31.632 --> 00:42:34.010
Mmm-hmm! Bad enough some of our
relatives are hanging outwith Medusa...

641
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.265
turning people to stone.

642
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:36.345
All right.

643
00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:38.648
Ooh! I love your hair.
I wish my hair would do that.

644
00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:39.940
Yeah, that will happen.

645
00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:42.439
Why don't you guys
make yourselves useful?

646
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:44.816
Demi-Google Luke for me.
These kids are looking for him.

647
00:42:44.896 --> 00:42:46.648
Why?
Do they have a death wish?

648
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.483
It doesn't matter. Just...

649
00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:49.692
Didn't even say "please."

650
00:42:49.776 --> 00:42:52.074
Told you! We should have
taken that job with Hercules.

651
00:42:52.153 --> 00:42:53.951
They're an acquired taste.

652
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.328
Luke. I don't know
what to do about him.

653
00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.536
I've tried reaching out,
but the kid's angry. He's resentful.

654
00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.337
And he holds a grudge
like nobody's business.

655
00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.914
Just like his mother,
come to think of it.

656
00:43:02.997 --> 00:43:04.874
Yeah, he's not my
biggest fan either.

657
00:43:04.957 --> 00:43:08.837
If you're gonna cross paths or,
Zeus forbid, swords with him...

658
00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:12.928
it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world
to have a thing or two to help you out.

659
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.055
Collector's item,
mint condition.

660
00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:17.637
<i>From Hercules Busts Heads,
Season One.</i>

661
00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.306
<i>Hercules Busts Heads?</i>

662
00:43:19.472 --> 00:43:20.849
Best TV show ever.

663
00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:23.943
So, of course, cancelled.

664
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.442
Got this off Deity-Bay.

665
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.699
You twist the cap off this, you release the
winds from the four corners of the Earth.

666
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.947
Now, you tell me
that isn't cool.

667
00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.703
Whoa! No, not in here!

668
00:43:34.362 --> 00:43:35.454
Not in here.

669
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.955
By the gods, George was right.
You do have a death wish.

670
00:43:39.784 --> 00:43:41.252
Now, you're also...

671
00:43:42.662 --> 00:43:44.881
You're also gonna
want one of these.

672
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:52.096
Um, thanks.

673
00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:54.094
Mythical box sealer?

674
00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:57.010
You wound me.
Truly, I am wounded.

675
00:43:57.176 --> 00:44:00.430
I hold in my hands a Matter Eliminator.
Trademark pending.

676
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:02.269
Anything you
outline with this...

677
00:44:02.348 --> 00:44:03.520
Not in here.

678
00:44:03.933 --> 00:44:05.310
...will disappear.

679
00:44:05.393 --> 00:44:07.361
Whoosh! Gone.
Instant hole.

680
00:44:07.436 --> 00:44:08.733
"Demi-Google Luke,"
he said.

681
00:44:08.813 --> 00:44:10.907
Except, how am I supposed
to type without fingers?

682
00:44:10.982 --> 00:44:12.529
You were supposed
to use the mouse!

683
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.030
I'm a snake.
I eat mice.

684
00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:15.953
All right, thank you.
Have you found Luke?

685
00:44:16.028 --> 00:44:17.245
Did he just say
"thank you"?

686
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.914
I'm sure it was
just a lapse.

687
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.617
Luke's on a yacht
called the Andromeda.

688
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.123
It's passing by Chesapeake
Beach as we speak.

689
00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:24.203
Thank you.

690
00:44:24.287 --> 00:44:26.039
You're sssso welcome.

691
00:44:26.122 --> 00:44:27.499
There, you happy?

692
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:29.084
Hush.

693
00:44:30.293 --> 00:44:31.715
Thank you very much.

694
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:33.296
Hey, listen...

695
00:44:33.462 --> 00:44:34.463
Urn...

696
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.717
If you see Luke...

697
00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:41.138
please explain
to him for me...

698
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.480
that parents, we make
mistakes sometimes.

699
00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.729
He has every right
to be angry at me.

700
00:44:48.895 --> 00:44:51.193
Just, please tell him not
to be angry with the world.

701
00:44:51.439 --> 00:44:55.535
I'm not sure if there's anything
that I can say that will change him.

702
00:44:55.693 --> 00:44:56.945
Try.

703
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.538
If it's one thing I've
learned in 3000 years...

704
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:01.992
it's you can't
give up on family.

705
00:45:09.248 --> 00:45:10.795
Thanks again.

706
00:45:12.627 --> 00:45:14.220
He'll never make it.

707
00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:16.213
That's lunch!

708
00:45:25.348 --> 00:45:27.601
That's it.
That's Luke's yacht.

709
00:45:27.767 --> 00:45:29.360
What do we do?
Swim?

710
00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:31.020
But it's water.

711
00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:33.690
Dad will help.

712
00:45:37.693 --> 00:45:38.694
Hey, Dad.

713
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:42.035
We're trying to save Camp Half-Blood
and rescue a satyr named Grover.

714
00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:45.664
And we could really use your help
getting to that ship out there.

715
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:48.413
Poseidon?

716
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.081
Dad?

717
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:51.750
It was a nice try,
big guy...

718
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.676
but don't be upset
when he doesn't...

719
00:46:01.259 --> 00:46:02.806
...answer.

720
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:11.352
It's a hippocampus.

721
00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:24.866
Hi, girl.

722
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.956
Boy.

723
00:46:31.205 --> 00:46:32.502
Come here.

724
00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:39.551
Sometimes, you just gotta ask.

725
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:42.641
All I've been doing is asking.

726
00:46:58.149 --> 00:46:59.401
Are you coming?

727
00:47:00.401 --> 00:47:01.402
Yeah.

728
00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:06.369
Are you ready?

729
00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:07.704
Yeah.

730
00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:09.119
Giddy up!

731
00:48:13.641 --> 00:48:14.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

732
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:16.940
Back up!

733
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.692
Back up.

734
00:48:29.156 --> 00:48:30.829
Thank you, friend.

735
00:48:30.908 --> 00:48:32.160
Tyson.

736
00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.078
Come on, buddy.
We gotta go.

737
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.332
Oh.

738
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.593
You want some sugar?

739
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.062
Have you seen it?
No, man.

740
00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:53.105
Did he show
it to you?

741
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.432
Wait until you see it.

742
00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:56.688
It took him
long enough to find it.

743
00:48:59.145 --> 00:49:02.069
That's Chris Rodriguez, Ethan
Nakamura, and Silena Beauregard.

744
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.775
Luke's been recruiting.

745
00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:05.610
Shh!

746
00:49:06.694 --> 00:49:08.537
This is a nice boat.

747
00:49:08.696 --> 00:49:10.619
How are we gonna
find Grover?

748
00:49:11.365 --> 00:49:14.539
Luke is probably keeping him
below deck somewhere.

749
00:49:14.702 --> 00:49:16.079
Like, in a brig.

750
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:18.547
I don't think yachts
have brigs, Percy.

751
00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.508
Follow me.

752
00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:29.051
Be careful, you guys.
He said keep your distance.

753
00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.224
How much longer are we
gonna be on this boat, anyway?

754
00:49:32.303 --> 00:49:34.226
Doesn't matter,
just watch it.

755
00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:46.901
It's so time to go.

756
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.407
Hey, Percy. Percy!

757
00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:50.946
Huh?

758
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.660
Tyson, do you
have to make so much noise?

759
00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:57.086
Sorry!

760
00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:14.637
Chris?

761
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:15.892
Hey.

762
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:18.190
What have you
done with Grover?

763
00:50:18.766 --> 00:50:22.771
Grover? Grover's
the least of your worries.

764
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:25.739
<i>Guess who's here.</i>

765
00:50:34.907 --> 00:50:38.537
What a surprise. If it isn't
my two favorite cousins.

766
00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:39.919
Three.

767
00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:41.626
I'm a son of
Poseidon, too.

768
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.340
That's funny, because Poseidon doesn't
have any other half-blood sons.

769
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.212
I'm a Cyclops.

770
00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:51.890
Mist.

771
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:53.722
You don't say.

772
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.436
It's been a long time.

773
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.981
You look good.

774
00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.821
Where's Grover?

775
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:07.823
Grover, Grover.

776
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:10.235
Oh, Grover, yes.
Right, the satyr.

777
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.904
He should be in the Sea of
Monsters right about now.

778
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:16.617
I sent him on ahead with some friends.
We're kind of on the clock.

779
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:18.663
Wait, you're not...

780
00:51:19.159 --> 00:51:22.038
You're not just trying to stop
us from getting the Fleece.

781
00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:23.589
I need it, too.

782
00:51:25.124 --> 00:51:27.968
I got something only
the Fleece can revive.

783
00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:30.004
And it's not a tree.

784
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:33.474
Wanna see it?

785
00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:43.606
It wasn't easy to find. I had to crawl
through the depths of Tartarus itself.

786
00:51:44.476 --> 00:51:46.524
And then Cleveland.

787
00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:49.652
The remains of Kronos.

788
00:51:49.815 --> 00:51:52.864
The original Titan,
father to the Olympians.

789
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:56.622
And with the Fleece's help,
destroyer of Olympus.

790
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.282
And the world.

791
00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:02.621
You'd destroy the whole world
just to get back at your dad?

792
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.714
The Olympians
overthrew their parents.

793
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:07.833
It's just our turn.

794
00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.422
We met your father.

795
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:12.847
He said that he knows
that he made mistakes.

796
00:52:13.005 --> 00:52:15.679
He told us to tell you
to not be so angry.

797
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.051
Really?

798
00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.222
And he couldn't
even tell me himself.

799
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:23.607
Does that sound familiar?

800
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:26.777
Take them to the brig.

801
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:28.149
Let's go. Come on.

802
00:52:28.228 --> 00:52:31.402
Thalia was your friend! She
sacrificed herself for you.

803
00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:36.537
You're gonna lecture me about Thalia
when you're hanging around with him?

804
00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:40.416
You disappoint me the most.

805
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:18.283
I told you he had a brig.

806
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:25.161
How can you trust him?

807
00:53:25.244 --> 00:53:26.871
He was probably making all
that noise on purpose.

808
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.797
He wanted Luke to catch us.

809
00:53:28.956 --> 00:53:31.209
What do you have
against Tyson anyway?

810
00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:32.964
He's a Cyclops.

811
00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:36.006
I think the politically correct
term is "ocularly impaired."

812
00:53:36.088 --> 00:53:38.887
Who cares? They're vicious
and they're dangerous.

813
00:53:44.722 --> 00:53:47.100
Yeah, vicious.

814
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:09.079
We have to get out of here.

815
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.668
How?

816
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:18.672
Just hang on to something.

817
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.501
All right,
here we go.

818
00:54:55.417 --> 00:54:57.169
Come OH, come on, come on!

819
00:55:06.053 --> 00:55:07.054
Urn...

820
00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:08.226
What's going on?

821
00:55:13.894 --> 00:55:15.771
Percy's trying to kill us.

822
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.112
I think it's working.

823
00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:32.663
You got it?

824
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.878
Piece of cake.

825
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.088
I think I'm gonna vomit.

826
00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.669
Yep.

827
00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:42.297
So, how does this work?

828
00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:46.139
I don't know. It's my
first mythical tape gun.

829
00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:07.407
Just like Hermes said...

830
00:56:08.156 --> 00:56:09.248
"instant hole."

831
00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.026
Go to the lifeboat.

832
00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:52.993
Kill the engines.

833
00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:00.500
That was for Grover.

834
00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:12.513
Grab him!

835
00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:37.546
We got him!

836
00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:47.556
What are you doing?

837
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:49.724
Don't walk on my roof.

838
00:57:55.555 --> 00:57:57.228
Join me, Percy.

839
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:58.893
It's what you
were meant to do.

840
00:57:59.267 --> 00:58:01.065
You can't escape
that prophecy.

841
00:58:01.979 --> 00:58:03.731
Let's show both
of our fathers.

842
00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.986
It's tempting.

843
00:58:09.111 --> 00:58:10.112
Oh...

844
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:12.956
That's genius. Really.

845
00:58:13.657 --> 00:58:15.250
But I think I'll pass.

846
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:33.594
Not this again.

847
00:58:35.929 --> 00:58:36.930
Go!

848
00:58:37.097 --> 00:58:38.314
Are you staying?

849
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:39.433
I'll be right behind you.

850
00:58:43.854 --> 00:58:45.197
May as well.

851
00:59:19.890 --> 00:59:21.312
Jackson, enough.

852
00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:28.149
You're on
the losing side.

853
00:59:28.815 --> 00:59:30.533
Not from
where I stand.

854
00:59:39.284 --> 00:59:40.285
Oh!

855
00:59:48.543 --> 00:59:50.090
Smart.

856
00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:53.006
Goddess of wisdom's
daughter, remember?

857
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.513
I remember.

858
01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:07.608
Our allies and the satyr still
have a head start on the Fleece.

859
01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.612
We will resurrect you,
Lord Kronos.

860
01:00:12.359 --> 01:00:14.407
You will know vengeance.

861
01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:19.199
And the Olympians who
scorned us will know death.

862
01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:40.724
Maybe you should reapply.

863
01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.441
It wore off?

864
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:46.977
Yeah.

865
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.457
Come on.

866
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.586
Oh, no.

867
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.297
Hey.

868
01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.255
Do you want to
steer for a while?

869
01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:17.766
Thank you.

870
01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:21.720
Nobody's ever trusted me
with anything before.

871
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:24.807
Is that because of your lack
of depth perception?

872
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.402
Is it because they're
scared of you?

873
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.483
I was in the mountains
one day...

874
01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:40.244
and some campers,
Boy Scouts, showed up.

875
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:46.624
And when they saw me,
they screamed.

876
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.665
They ran.

877
01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.718
And I'm pretty sure I smiled.

878
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:59.387
People look at me,
and they see a monster.

879
01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.469
Sometimes, I think
maybe they're right.

880
01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:08.730
You're not a monster.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

881
01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.646
Easy for you to say.

882
01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:14.155
What do you mean?

883
01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.610
You never doubt yourself or
think you're less than you are.

884
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.699
Thank you, brother.

885
01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.952
Come here. Open it slowly.

886
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.335
Slowly.

887
01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:34.168
Hey, just take it slow.
Slow, okay?

888
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:43.306
I wouldn't have trusted him
with a normal thermos.

889
01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:45.686
He seems okay.

890
01:02:45.845 --> 01:02:48.689
I really don't get what
your problem with him is.

891
01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.361
Because you don't know
what I know about them.

892
01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:55.688
Thalia!

893
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.578
A Cyclops killed her.

894
01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.210
His kind killed Thalia.

895
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.206
I'm sorry.

896
01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.125
I never knew.

897
01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.886
Well, it's not something
I like talking about.

898
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.632
And anyway,
it was a long time ago.

899
01:03:31.433 --> 01:03:32.810
What is that?

900
01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.729
It's the Sea of Monsters.

901
01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.745
Why are we stopping?

902
01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.242
I should have used two hands.

903
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.703
You think?

904
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:52.920
Are you mad at me?

905
01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.047
No, not at you.

906
01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:13.725
Tell me those
aren't sharks.

907
01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:18.905
Those aren't sharks.

908
01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:21.946
Paddle! Paddle!

909
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.953
Yeah, sharks would be better.

910
01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.306
It's Charybdis.

911
01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:46.762
Charyb-... What?

912
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.843
She guards
the Sea of Monsters.

913
01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:55.896
Percy!

914
01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:04.909
It's not working!

915
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.868
The Sea of Monsters might not
be in Poseidon's domain.

916
01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.410
Hold on!

917
01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.204
Where are we?

918
01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:57.996
Smells like the stomach.

919
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.513
Watch your step.

920
01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.312
What is this stuff?

921
01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.435
I don't think
you want to know.

922
01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:21.519
Whoa!

923
01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.481
This has to be the worst
way to die, ever.

924
01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:28.402
Yeah, everything that disappears
in the Bermuda Triangle...

925
01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.696
this is where they end up.

926
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.031
Oh, come on!

927
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.458
That sounded
like Clarisse.

928
01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.331
No, it couldn't be her.

929
01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:40.293
You ridiculously
stupid morons.

930
01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:42.378
No, it's her.
It's her.

931
01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.921
You idiot!

932
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:51.304
Better keep my electric grid up and
running, or I'll plug your head into it!

933
01:06:51.382 --> 01:06:53.305
Clarisse! Hey!

934
01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:59.190
Jackson? What are
you doing here?

935
01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:01.477
We got swallowed
up, just like you.

936
01:07:01.643 --> 01:07:02.735
Nice ship.

937
01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.939
My dad's got tons of this stuff left
over from wars throughout history.

938
01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.774
It was either this or
a Huey from Vietnam.

939
01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:10.030
I figured a boat would
be more practical.

940
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:14.368
What's going on?

941
01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:17.951
Pretty much exactly what you think
goes on inside of a stomach.

942
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.507
You're right.

943
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.597
That really is
the worst way to die.

944
01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:35.723
Reardon!

945
01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.271
What in Hades is going on with my engine?
Is it ready yet?

946
01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:41.270
Almost, ma'am.
They're working on it.

947
01:07:41.432 --> 01:07:44.060
Wait, your crew
is zombies?

948
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.318
They prefer "dead Confederate sailors whose
lives have been given in tribute to Ares."

949
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.869
But "zombies" is fine.

950
01:08:07.667 --> 01:08:10.261
Reardon! Gun!
Faster! Now!

951
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.388
Gun is hot, Cap'n.
Locked and loaded.

952
01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.465
Aim it at
that meat grinder.

953
01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:16.885
Wait, wait. You want to
shoot that thing with this?

954
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:20.142
Do you have a better idea?
Because now would be the time.

955
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.897
Hey, Clarisse.

956
01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:26.690
What?

957
01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.105
Can you steer the ship?

958
01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:29.564
No. I just finished
driver's ed.

959
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.032
Yes, of course,
I can steer a ship.

960
01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.529
Well...

961
01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.486
why don't we give
her a stomach ache?

962
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.492
We'll escape
through the gut.

963
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:38.998
It just might work
if it doesn't kill us first.

964
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.417
You steer, I'll shoot.

965
01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:44.166
All hands below deck!

966
01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:48.291
Good luck, Percy.

967
01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:57.722
All hands below deck. This is not a drill!
Come on, boys. Get in there.

968
01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:03.640
This is still my quest.

969
01:09:03.806 --> 01:09:05.934
Do not screw this
up for me, Jackson.

970
01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:20.948
Ah!

971
01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:27.626
You should watch
what you eat.

972
01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:44.597
Go!

973
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.391
No kidding, genius.

974
01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:00.371
I hope this works.

975
01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:03.699
Just don't forget.

976
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:04.951
Forget what?

977
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.501
This is all your idea.

978
01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:23.469
Whoa!

979
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.892
Come on, come on.

980
01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:40.870
We did it!
I did it!

981
01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.578
Listen up.
Full power to the screws.

982
01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:46.084
Hey, are you guys
all right?

983
01:10:46.159 --> 01:10:47.536
That was amazing.

984
01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.215
You have to have
faith, right?

985
01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:55.794
And a cannon.
We'll find Grover.

986
01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.092
Where is Ichneutae?

987
01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:00.765
Oh, now you miss
Ichneutae?

988
01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.935
We ran into Scylla, that
multi-headed Hydra thing.

989
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.720
He said, "I got this."

990
01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.355
Famous last words.

991
01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.607
We've restored
full power, Cap'n.

992
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.692
- Heading?
- Northwest.

993
01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:21.198
Are you sure about that?

994
01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:24.622
Yes, I'm sure about that.
Why, do you have a problem?

995
01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:25.698
Yeah, you got
a problem?

996
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:33.590
I think your Confederate warship is
heading to West Palm Beach, Florida.

997
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:35.708
What is it?

998
01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:39.425
I know this sounds insane, but
it's kind of like my dyslexia.

999
01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:43.808
But instead of being able to
read Greek, I can see map lines.

1000
01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:47.728
30, 31, 75, 12.

1001
01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.857
Wait, that's the numbers
from the--

1002
01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:54.690
From the crazy,
eyeless taxi drivers.

1003
01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:55.944
They're coordinates.

1004
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.193
Ha! Waterboy figured it out.

1005
01:11:58.272 --> 01:11:59.444
And he called
you crazy.

1006
01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:00.696
Actually, he called
you crazy.

1007
01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.618
Hey, eye on the road.

1008
01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.246
30, 31 degrees north...

1009
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.908
75, 12 degrees west.

1010
01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.543
That's where Polyphemus
and the Fleece are.

1011
01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:12.996
Change course. Southwest.

1012
01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:14.539
Aye, aye.

1013
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:16.124
Sorry.

1014
01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:40.440
Land ho!

1015
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.867
Polyphemus lives in
an amusement park?

1016
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.827
No, he lives
on an island.

1017
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:53.086
But the goddess Circe thought building an
amusement park on top of it was a good idea.

1018
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.412
It really wasn't.

1019
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:55.792
What happened?

1020
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.582
Opening day...

1021
01:12:57.665 --> 01:13:01.886
long lines of savory half-bloods
and one hungry Cyclops.

1022
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:04.092
Bad for business.

1023
01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.640
I'll just turn us
right around then.

1024
01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.639
Find us a place to dock.

1025
01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.105
I was afraid she
was gonna say that.

1026
01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:33.827
I guess the Cyclops
was bad for business.

1027
01:13:33.993 --> 01:13:35.245
Who knew?

1028
01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.254
We don't have time
to search this whole place.

1029
01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:44.303
I don't think
we have to.

1030
01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:48.925
"Plummet
of Death"?

1031
01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:51.177
That's subtle.

1032
01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.018
It looks like something
really big went through there.

1033
01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:59.277
I don't know. It doesn't
really scream "Cyclops" to me.

1034
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.358
At least
there's no line.

1035
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.824
Sweet ride.

1036
01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.290
Might need a push.

1037
01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.715
Here we go.

1038
01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.346
- Tyson? Let go of my hand.
- Sorry.

1039
01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:37.474
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1040
01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.886
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1041
01:14:38.912 --> 01:14:41.135
<i>It's a small world after all</i>

1042
01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.646
Could you two
just shut up?

1043
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:48.734
Hold on!

1044
01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:52.580
Is everybody okay?

1045
01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.749
I thought that
would be more fun.

1046
01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:03.040
I think I get what
Grover was so worried about.

1047
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.011
This must be the boulder Polyphemus
used to trap Odysseus...

1048
01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:09.635
when he was returning
from the Trojan War.

1049
01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.433
Yeah, that's right.
I know stuff.

1050
01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.609
Grover!

1051
01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.412
Enough!

1052
01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:37.200
I can't take this anymore!

1053
01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:46.921
It's been two days!

1054
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.379
Calm your temper!
Calm your temper!

1055
01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:53.842
I haven't had a decent meal since
those half-bloods you brought!

1056
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.761
And this stupid fleece
is supposed to lure satyrs!

1057
01:15:56.844 --> 01:15:58.596
Do you see any
satyrs around here?

1058
01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:03.317
This hunger is making
my eyesight worse.

1059
01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.228
I could just eat you.

1060
01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:10.316
If you weren't a Cyclops.

1061
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.069
Grover!

1062
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.821
Grover!

1063
01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.414
Hey!
Come here!

1064
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.742
Percy?

1065
01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:22.036
Hey!

1066
01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.665
Why are you wearing a dress?

1067
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:28.046
I'm having a really bad day!

1068
01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.587
Hey, hey, hey!
Do not let that go viral!

1069
01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:33.176
Sorry, there's no way the other
kids would believe me otherwise.

1070
01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.677
This is a disguise.

1071
01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:37.351
The guy's half-blind. He thinks
I'm a Cyclops chambermaid.

1072
01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:38.973
I'm showing mad
survival skills, here.

1073
01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.475
And not a small
amount of leg.

1074
01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:41.555
Funny.

1075
01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:45.109
I was trying to stay uneaten long enough to
figure out how to get the Fleece off of him.

1076
01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.606
So, did you?

1077
01:16:47.311 --> 01:16:49.689
Do you think I'd still be
dressed like this if I did?

1078
01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.445
It's a good look.

1079
01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.654
Thanks, Tyson.

1080
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:59.867
Clopsies, how about I cook
you something to drink...

1081
01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.909
to calm your nerves?

1082
01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.047
I don't know
what to do anymore.

1083
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:08.215
Go! Go!

1084
01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:11.127
This fleece used
to lure satyrs every day.

1085
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:12.211
Huh?

1086
01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:17.718
Now things are so bad, I even
had to eat my own sheep.

1087
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.935
The whole flock!

1088
01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.847
They were tender, though.

1089
01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.401
Drop me, and I promise you'll
never hear the end of it.

1090
01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:34.651
Do you smell something?
Smells like half-bloods!

1091
01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:40.823
Half-bloods!

1092
01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.704
- Get up, quick!
- I was right!

1093
01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.330
You stay right there!

1094
01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.083
Woman, get a fire going!

1095
01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:47.542
That's not good!

1096
01:17:47.621 --> 01:17:49.089
On second thought...

1097
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.713
I'll just eat you raw!

1098
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:52.793
Hey!

1099
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.211
Huh.

1100
01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.673
Hiya!

1101
01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:58.341
My name's Tyson.
How are you?

1102
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:00.934
These guys are
my friends...

1103
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.020
so I was hoping,
maybe, we could talk.

1104
01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:05.518
You know,
Cyclops to Cyclops.

1105
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.604
You pissant with one eye!

1106
01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:09.313
Hey! Not nice!

1107
01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:13.777
You're no Cyclops!
You're a traitor to your kind!

1108
01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:14.940
To be honest...

1109
01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:17.614
Huh? What?

1110
01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.611
He's my kind.

1111
01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.780
You disgust me.

1112
01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:28.538
Going somewhere?

1113
01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.677
I think you've got
something of mine.

1114
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:37.846
Annabeth!

1115
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.468
Oh!

1116
01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.471
Clarisse!

1117
01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:58.030
Get back here, you punk!

1118
01:18:58.192 --> 01:18:59.660
Yo, Clopsies!

1119
01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.413
I quit!

1120
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.584
Wait, you're a dude?

1121
01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.289
Well, that explains a lot.

1122
01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:11.330
Say goodbye.
Okay. Goodbye!

1123
01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:14.717
You deceitful little brats!
I'll tear off your flesh!

1124
01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.340
Come on! Go, go!

1125
01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.505
Give me that fleece!

1126
01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.186
You're dead!

1127
01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.859
I'm gonna kill all of you!

1128
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.194
Do you hear me?

1129
01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.279
Get back here!

1130
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.953
We rocked that quest.

1131
01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.705
Yeah, we totally did.

1132
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.165
I didn't know you
guys had it in you!

1133
01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.545
Yes.

1134
01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:54.252
Well done.

1135
01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.216
It's nice work.
I really appreciate it.

1136
01:20:02.172 --> 01:20:03.219
I'll take that.

1137
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.513
I don't think so.

1138
01:20:10.222 --> 01:20:11.223
Suit yourself.

1139
01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:30.417
You'd do it for me.

1140
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.204
No!

1141
01:20:57.311 --> 01:20:59.313
Just remember...

1142
01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:01.528
it didn't have
to end this way.

1143
01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:04.735
This one's on you.

1144
01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:12.868
Down, boy!

1145
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.128
You should consider
yourselves lucky.

1146
01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.055
This has been millennia
in the making.

1147
01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:27.637
And you all get to see it.

1148
01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:30.260
You used to
be one of us!

1149
01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.727
And then I woke up.

1150
01:21:38.352 --> 01:21:42.073
Percy, if Kronos comes back, that's it.
Game over.

1151
01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:45.488
Percy.

1152
01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.950
I never called him "brother."

1153
01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:53.371
All he ever wanted
was a brother...

1154
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.288
but I was too
wrapped up in myself.

1155
01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.838
And now Luke has the Fleece...

1156
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.173
because I gave it to him.

1157
01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:10.093
I destroy Olympus,
just like the Oracle said.

1158
01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.516
Forget the Oracle.

1159
01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:18.268
You're worried about your destiny?
Then write a new one.

1160
01:22:19.309 --> 01:22:21.107
You're angry at Poseidon
for ignoring you?

1161
01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.109
Then show him
why he shouldn't.

1162
01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.858
You're upset about Tyson?

1163
01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:29.445
Then make sure he didn't
die for nothing.

1164
01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:31.246
She's right.

1165
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.912
What?

1166
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.828
There's no way you're
getting me to repeat that.

1167
01:22:39.329 --> 01:22:41.377
What Annabeth
is saying, Perce...

1168
01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:43.755
is that we're with you.

1169
01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.669
Just give the word.

1170
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.466
Why me?

1171
01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.889
I mean, who voted me leader?

1172
01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:07.575
Lord Kronos, he who was
betrayed by his sons...

1173
01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:10.657
hear now the words of one
betrayed by his father.

1174
01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:13.447
I bid you... rise.

1175
01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:52.903
Grover!

1176
01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:55.948
Hands.

1177
01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:59.660
Try not to cut them off.
I'm pretty attached to them.

1178
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.977
I have to get to the Fleece.

1179
01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.141
So, what are we
supposed to do?

1180
01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:26.479
Right.

1181
01:24:55.048 --> 01:24:57.597
I know you can breathe
under water, Jackson.

1182
01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.519
But can you breathe
like this?

1183
01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:10.856
Hi, Brother!

1184
01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:25.875
What the--?

1185
01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.171
The water.

1186
01:25:28.665 --> 01:25:30.133
It healed me.

1187
01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.087
Son of Poseidon.

1188
01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.264
Thank you...

1189
01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:43.350
Brother.

1190
01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.672
He rises.

1191
01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:27.269
Master!

1192
01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.105
I brought you back!

1193
01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.991
My Lord!

1194
01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:41.279
It's Luke!

1195
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.160
Luke Castellan!
Your great-grandson!

1196
01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.996
My favorite.

1197
01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:33.373
Whoa!

1198
01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:37.006
Grover!

1199
01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:14.335
It's the cursed blade!

1200
01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.876
"...cursed blade shall reap."

1201
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:47.573
You want to know
who gave me this sword?

1202
01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:51.664
The god that killed you
with it in the first place!

1203
01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.256
My father.

1204
01:28:57.415 --> 01:28:59.008
Percy Jackson...

1205
01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.795
your destiny was
written long ago.

1206
01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:05.256
No!

1207
01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.599
I make my own destiny.

1208
01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.221
Half-blood!

1209
01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.724
Just in time for dinner.

1210
01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:17.711
Thanks, Dad.

1211
01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.675
Percy.

1212
01:30:29.382 --> 01:30:30.759
Annabeth!

1213
01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:35.138
Grover!

1214
01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.792
Annabeth!

1215
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:03.879
No, no!

1216
01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.883
At least I'll be
with Thalia in Elysium.

1217
01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.218
Come here.
Give me the Fleece!

1218
01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:10.841
Come on! Come on.

1219
01:31:10.966 --> 01:31:11.967
Come on.

1220
01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:18.060
We make our own destinies, right?
So show me.

1221
01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.395
I have faith in you.

1222
01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:26.148
No, no.
Come on, show me.

1223
01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:28.317
Show me.

1224
01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.286
Come on.

1225
01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.030
Annie.

1226
01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:14.871
What happened?

1227
01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:16.739
Don't worry about it.

1228
01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:19.292
If anyone else
wants to die tonight...

1229
01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.499
at least we have this.

1230
01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.499
Hey. You're alive.

1231
01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:27.800
Yeah.

1232
01:32:28.501 --> 01:32:30.845
What you did for Percy...

1233
01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.678
that was not so
vicious and dangerous.

1234
01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.470
Thanks.

1235
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.221
No.

1236
01:32:40.847 --> 01:32:42.144
Thank you.

1237
01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:54.360
You know
what, Tyson?

1238
01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:57.118
I know a lot of campers with two
eyes who couldn't do what you did.

1239
01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:59.291
Hey, Clarisse.
What?

1240
01:32:59.449 --> 01:33:01.872
Come on, big guy. We get back
to camp, the nectar's on me.

1241
01:33:01.951 --> 01:33:03.669
Have you
met the nymphs?

1242
01:33:04.329 --> 01:33:05.831
This was your quest.

1243
01:33:06.873 --> 01:33:10.503
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1244
01:33:10.668 --> 01:33:12.921
I think you should
be the one who gets to...

1245
01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.677
...do the honors.

1246
01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.150
Here you go, Thalia.

1247
01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:49.609
Clarisse!
Clarisse! Clarisse!

1248
01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:56.528
Nectar?

1249
01:34:58.484 --> 01:34:59.531
If you haven't had...

1250
01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:00.783
...you haven't lived.

1251
01:35:06.326 --> 01:35:07.623
You know what?

1252
01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:11.047
You don't need
these anymore.

1253
01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.171
There, that's better.

1254
01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:29.978
<i>You seem happy.</i>

1255
01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:34.230
I'm just relieved to have that whole
prophecy thing off my shoulders.

1256
01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:37.023
I'm not altogether
sure it is, Percy.

1257
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:41.320
You've done wonderfully, but you are
still the only living human child...

1258
01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:43.784
of Poseidon,
Hades, or Zeus.

1259
01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:45.369
Besides...

1260
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:48.190
it's quite possible the
Oracle wasn't referring

1261
01:35:48.216 --> 01:35:50.653
to what would unfold
on Polyphemus' island.

1262
01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.711
I'm just saying, a lot can happen
between now and your 20th birthday.

1263
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.792
That's not really
what I meant.

1264
01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:59.550
What I meant was finding
out you have a destiny...

1265
01:35:59.712 --> 01:36:03.342
is a lot like finding out you have
a half-brother who's a Cyclops.

1266
01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:05.973
It might not be as
bad as you think.

1267
01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:21.530
Percy! Percy!

1268
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.953
Percy!

1269
01:36:24.279 --> 01:36:27.078
Annabeth was guarding
the tree last night...

1270
01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.867
and something happened.

1271
01:36:31.035 --> 01:36:32.127
Percy.

1272
01:36:32.704 --> 01:36:34.377
The Fleece!
What happened?

1273
01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:37.049
It was even more powerful
than we thought.

1274
01:36:56.728 --> 01:36:58.150
Come on, help her.

1275
01:36:59.939 --> 01:37:01.156
Who are you?

1276
01:37:02.108 --> 01:37:04.486
Percy. Everything's
all right, it's okay.

1277
01:37:04.902 --> 01:37:06.324
I had the strangest dream.

1278
01:37:06.404 --> 01:37:07.405
Yeah?

1279
01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:09.411
Like I was dying.

1280
01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.118
What's your name?

1281
01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.417
I'm Thalia, daughter of Zeus.

1282
01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:21.086
<i>Another living child
of the eldest gods.</i>

1283
01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.174
<i>Maybe it wasn't me.</i>

1284
01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.185
<i>Maybe the Oracle meant
Thalia all along.</i>

1285
01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:32.973
<i>Could she be our salvation?</i>

1286
01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.771
<i>Or the cause of
our destruction ?</i>

1286
01:37:36.305 --> 01:37:42.370
