1
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.361
- Remember when they used to let commercial airlines land in this town?
- Yeah.

2
00:00:57.444 --> 00:00:59.697
Well, I don't understand where we're going...

3
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.950
...or why the hell we're bothering anyhow.

4
00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:05.161
- You're doing a good deed.
- Wanna give us a better reason?

5
00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:09.416
Yeah. A maniac hijacked a municipal bus with 30
passengers on it. That's a very good reason.

6
00:01:09.874 --> 00:01:13.379
And I got a real bad hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

7
00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:14.880
You wanna share it with us?

8
00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:16.549
Phoenix.

9
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.384
Simon Phoenix.

10
00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.676
Send a maniac to catch one.

11
00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:02.913
Phoenix!

12
00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:15.427
Don't move, Phoenix.

13
00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:20.558
You're under arrest.

14
00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:22.768
Arrest? Shit.

15
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:25.271
And you're trespassing.

16
00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.024
Where are the passengers?

17
00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.152
Oh, yes, passengers.

18
00:03:30.318 --> 00:03:31.862
Well, they're....

19
00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:34.197
Fuck you.

20
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.158
The passengers are gone.

21
00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:40.120
See, I told the city, I said
"Look, nobody comes down here."

22
00:03:40.747 --> 00:03:42.457
Postmen figured it out...

23
00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:44.208
...policemen figured it out.

24
00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:47.587
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

25
00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:50.006
Last time, Phoenix.

26
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:52.383
Where are the hostages?

27
00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:55.763
To hell with the hostages!
This is between you and me!

28
00:04:00.642 --> 00:04:01.727
What you got, soldier boy?

29
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.895
Do something.

30
00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:04.271
Go ahead.

31
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:07.400
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

32
00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.655
I'll set your ass on fire.

33
00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:27.380
Is it cold in here...

34
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.673
...or is it just me?

35
00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:03.377
Where are they, Phoenix?

36
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.212
Now, where did I put them?

37
00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:08.758
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

38
00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:12.095
I'll keep that in mind.

39
00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:56.810
Damn it, John. I'm tired
of this "Demolition-Man" shit!

40
00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.521
You were not supposed
to come down here!

41
00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:03.192
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix single-handed...

42
00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:04.943
...and you were not supposed to blow anything up!

43
00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:08.197
It's not me, this time, Healy. He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

44
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.949
Yeah right, you had nothing to do with it.

45
00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.660
I know you've been trying
to nail this psycho for 2 years.

46
00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:14.704
But try remembering a little thing called...

47
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.623
...official police procedure.

48
00:06:16.706 --> 00:06:18.666
- Where are the hostages?
- They're not here.

49
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.459
What do you mean they are not here?

50
00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.462
He must've stashed them someplace else!

51
00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:23.422
How do you know they weren't in there? Are you sure?

52
00:06:23.506 --> 00:06:27.051
Because I did a thermo check and there
was only eight of them, all part of his gang.

53
00:06:27.134 --> 00:06:28.302
Wrong again!

54
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.221
You got something to say, scumbag?

55
00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:32.681
Get him out of here!

56
00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:34.518
Motherfucker!

57
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:36.853
You and I gonna have a nice long chat.

58
00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:38.730
Captain!

59
00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:42.192
Over here! There's bodies everywhere!

60
00:06:42.317 --> 00:06:43.860
There must be 20 or 30.

61
00:06:43.944 --> 00:06:45.446
They're everywhere.

62
00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.241
See that, Captain? I told him!

63
00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:50.159
He said he didn't care!

64
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.205
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

65
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:56.749
What kind of man are you?

66
00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.170
We're gonna spend a lot of quality time together.
See you, sweetie!

67
00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:01.797
Honey! Sugar!

68
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.175
If you got a lawyer, you better call him.

69
00:08:01.528 --> 00:08:05.115
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for the city of Los Angeles.

70
00:08:05.574 --> 00:08:08.827
So, it is with some regret that, I,
William Smithers...

71
00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:12.499
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

72
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:14.042
Skip it.

73
00:08:15.085 --> 00:08:17.253
Sargeant Spartan, you've been sentenced to 70 years...

74
00:08:17.337 --> 00:08:21.591
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

75
00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:25.262
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 innocent civilians.

76
00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:26.806
Skip it.

77
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.351
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

78
00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:33.979
...during which your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

79
00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:37.526
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

80
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:47.577
I'm sorry, Sargeant.

81
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.735
"All personnel..."

82
00:11:51.818 --> 00:11:55.448
"...the next scheduled parole hearing
for prisoner Gilmour..."

83
00:11:55.573 --> 00:11:57.617
"...will take place at 07:15"

84
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.747
"Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room"

85
00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:10.506
Mellow greetings, Warden William Smithers.

86
00:12:11.173 --> 00:12:13.717
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

87
00:12:14.593 --> 00:12:16.428
As it is a beautiful...

88
00:12:16.595 --> 00:12:20.308
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

89
00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:23.144
...I'm hereby querying you
on the prison population update.

90
00:12:23.228 --> 00:12:24.979
Does the tedium continue?

91
00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:27.816
Your earnest questioning is as amusing as it is irrelevant.

92
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:30.610
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

93
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.407
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

94
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.242
- Don't you think?
- I try not to.

95
00:12:36.325 --> 00:12:38.661
However, you're young, think all you want.

96
00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:41.872
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

97
00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:44.793
I'll fiber-op you back
after the parole hearings.

98
00:12:44.876 --> 00:12:46.461
Have a peachy day, Lieutenant.

99
00:12:46.628 --> 00:12:47.671
Be well.

100
00:12:47.838 --> 00:12:48.713
Be well.

101
00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:50.215
"Vector 137"

102
00:12:50.298 --> 00:12:52.801
"Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard"

103
00:12:58.015 --> 00:12:59.725
"Retina coding accepted"

104
00:12:59.892 --> 00:13:01.978
"Warden William Smithers, be well"

105
00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:03.479
Go on.

106
00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:12.656
Self-drive on.

107
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.533
"Self-drive engaged"

108
00:13:14.908 --> 00:13:16.285
Huxley, Lenina, coding on.

109
00:13:16.577 --> 00:13:20.331
"No police presence is requested
in the city at this time"

110
00:13:20.498 --> 00:13:21.666
"Report to the station"

111
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.668
Oh boy, how exciting.

112
00:13:59.415 --> 00:14:00.416
That's it.

113
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.335
Food, glorious food.

114
00:14:03.044 --> 00:14:04.462
There'll be another one in about 12 hours.

115
00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.923
These assholes are nothing if not predictable.

116
00:14:07.298 --> 00:14:08.841
God, I love to hate this place!

117
00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:10.594
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

118
00:14:10.677 --> 00:14:12.679
That doesn't really matter anymore, does it Crow?

119
00:14:12.763 --> 00:14:14.139
People are hungry.

120
00:14:14.223 --> 00:14:16.141
We've got nothing left to lose.

121
00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:31.324
Greetings, Merwin.

122
00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:33.034
Lovely Lenina.

123
00:14:34.954 --> 00:14:38.457
Greetings and salutations. Welcome
to the emergency line of the SAPD.

124
00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:42.336
If you prefer an automated response,
press 1 now.

125
00:14:42.503 --> 00:14:43.796
Be well.

126
00:14:47.175 --> 00:14:49.177
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

127
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:51.263
Let me guess, all is serene?

128
00:14:51.471 --> 00:14:54.266
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a.m.

129
00:14:54.683 --> 00:14:56.852
There was a defacement of public buildings.

130
00:14:57.018 --> 00:14:58.896
Walls smudged with...

131
00:14:59.355 --> 00:15:01.023
...scandalous graffiti.

132
00:15:01.107 --> 00:15:02.191
Really?

133
00:15:02.358 --> 00:15:05.319
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

134
00:15:05.528 --> 00:15:09.031
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

135
00:15:10.116 --> 00:15:11.869
Lieutenant Huxley...

136
00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:15.038
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

137
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.040
...to the warden this morning.

138
00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:20.127
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

139
00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:24.758
Your fascination with the vulgar 20th century
seems to be affecting your better judgment.

140
00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:29.637
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and sworn personnel.

141
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:32.390
Thank you for the attitude re-adjustment, Chief Earle.

142
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.267
Info assimilated.

143
00:15:42.067 --> 00:15:43.736
Sanctimonious asshole.

144
00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:46.572
"Lenina Huxley, you are fined one half credit..."

145
00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:49.743
"...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute"

146
00:15:49.826 --> 00:15:51.203
Thank you.

147
00:15:58.251 --> 00:15:59.586
That was tense.

148
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.506
- That was tense?
- Yes.

149
00:16:02.491 --> 00:16:07.929
Tell me something, Garcia? Don't you get bored
code tracing perps who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

150
00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:10.473
Actually, no. I find my job deeply fulfilling.

151
00:16:11.265 --> 00:16:14.937
I just can not get over the reality
of this office, Lenina Huxley.

152
00:16:15.437 --> 00:16:17.898
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

153
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:21.276
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

154
00:16:21.693 --> 00:16:23.153
Holy smokes!

155
00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:28.034
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

156
00:16:28.118 --> 00:16:29.452
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.

157
00:16:31.079 --> 00:16:33.581
Don't you ever want something to happen?

158
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:36.084
Goodness, no.

159
00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:38.629
I knew you were gonna say that.

160
00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.634
What I wouldn't give for some action.

161
00:16:54.438 --> 00:16:56.189
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

162
00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:00.110
One of our first
and most illustrious members.

163
00:17:01.486 --> 00:17:02.655
Allow me to...

164
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.658
...welcome you to your parole hearing.

165
00:17:06.033 --> 00:17:07.952
Let's get this over quickly.

166
00:17:10.955 --> 00:17:14.793
Twenty-nine years ago,
the parole system, as you know it...

167
00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:18.881
...was rendered obsolete.

168
00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.926
Federal Statute 537-29....

169
00:17:27.307 --> 00:17:28.349
Stop it!

170
00:17:31.936 --> 00:17:34.814
Do you have anything fresh to say
on your behalf?

171
00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:39.820
I thought not.

172
00:17:42.573 --> 00:17:43.491
Yeah.

173
00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:44.867
I do.

174
00:17:45.826 --> 00:17:46.994
Teddy bear.

175
00:18:04.764 --> 00:18:06.682
How'd you know the password to the cuffs?

176
00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:08.434
I wish I knew.

177
00:18:08.518 --> 00:18:10.186

00:29:22.997 --> 00:29:26.584
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

355
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:29.587
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

356
00:29:30.588 --> 00:29:32.340
Now they have a leader.

357
00:29:32.757 --> 00:29:35.677
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

358
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:38.639
...to infect our harmony with his venom.

359
00:29:39.264 --> 00:29:41.016
He must, of course...

360
00:29:41.225 --> 00:29:42.601
...be stopped.

361
00:29:43.393 --> 00:29:46.731
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

362
00:29:46.815 --> 00:29:49.692
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

363
00:29:52.403 --> 00:29:53.905
Safety Above All.

364
00:29:54.948 --> 00:29:57.742
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

365
00:29:59.078 --> 00:30:00.287
If you'll excuse me.

366
00:30:03.582 --> 00:30:04.834
Dr. Cocteau...

367
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.796
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

368
00:30:09.296 --> 00:30:13.426
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

369
00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:15.295
Enhance your calm. Enhance your...

370
00:30:19.724 --> 00:30:21.393
"Be well" them for me.

371
00:30:26.315 --> 00:30:29.110
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

372
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.738
It was just....

373
00:30:33.657 --> 00:30:35.008
And he was so....

374
00:30:36.294 --> 00:30:39.413
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

375
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.331
It was fun for him.

376
00:30:41.832 --> 00:30:45.836
I want you to do everything in your
power to snare this agent of destruction.

377
00:30:46.003 --> 00:30:48.088
"You have my utmost confidence."

378
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.301
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

379
00:30:52.844 --> 00:30:53.845
"Be well."

380
00:30:58.683 --> 00:31:00.518
"Utmost confidence"

381
00:31:01.854 --> 00:31:03.772
"Everything in our power"

382
00:31:07.776 --> 00:31:09.278
What else is there?

383
00:31:10.696 --> 00:31:12.156
Zachary Lamb...

384
00:31:12.656 --> 00:31:16.620
...how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

385
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.247
Twelve-state manhunt.

386
00:31:19.581 --> 00:31:21.583
Satellite surveillance.

387
00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:24.794
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

388
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.465
None of them worked.

389
00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:30.218
In the end, it took just one man.

390
00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:31.677
One cop.

391
00:31:32.637 --> 00:31:34.138
John Spartan.

392
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.765
John Spartan?

393
00:31:35.848 --> 00:31:37.308
That's right.

394
00:31:37.517 --> 00:31:40.020
They called him the "Demolition Man".

395
00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:44.064
"Spartan file 98345, LAPD"

396
00:31:45.359 --> 00:31:48.986
"Spartan file 98761C, LAPD"

397
00:31:52.325 --> 00:31:54.661
Are you sure this is real life?

398
00:31:54.828 --> 00:31:56.079
Barely.

399
00:31:56.329 --> 00:31:57.622
Spartan's a legend.

400
00:31:57.705 --> 00:32:01.876
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

401
00:32:02.043 --> 00:32:04.088
All authentic criminals.

402
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:06.715
There was a lot more business back then.

403
00:32:06.799 --> 00:32:09.927
"How can you justify
destroying a $7 million mini mall..."

404
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.847
"...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?"

405
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.348
"Fuck you, lady."

406
00:32:14.683 --> 00:32:16.017
"Good answer."

407
00:32:17.102 --> 00:32:19.187
This is your recommendation?

408
00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.606
The Demolition Man's an animal.

409
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:26.361
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

410
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:29.115
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

411
00:32:30.032 --> 00:32:32.535
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

412
00:32:32.702 --> 00:32:35.621
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

413
00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:37.707
We need an old-fashioned cop.

414
00:33:02.275 --> 00:33:06.905
"Cryo-fac 312-618 is now ready
for routine maintenance and inspection"

415
00:33:26.426 --> 00:33:28.220
"John Spartan, 5864"

416
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.099
"Pulmonary activity approaching normal"

417
00:33:32.266 --> 00:33:34.769
"Body temperature, 63% and rising"

418
00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:38.105
"Biolink engaged"

419
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:41.860
"Laser defibrillation sequence started"

420
00:33:42.778 --> 00:33:45.113
"Plasma transfer in 15 seconds"

421
00:33:47.032 --> 00:33:49.368
"Plasma transfer, 10 seconds..."

422
00:33:49.952 --> 00:33:51.286
"...8 seconds..."

423
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.205
"...6 seconds...."

424
00:33:54.791 --> 00:33:56.876
"Plasma transfer complete"

425
00:33:58.044 --> 00:33:59.546
"MTL complete"

426
00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:22.654
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

427
00:34:22.988 --> 00:34:24.906
...by releasing another one?

428
00:34:25.407 --> 00:34:26.908
I am unconvinced.

429
00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:29.494
This is within the powers of the police charter, sir.

430
00:34:29.578 --> 00:34:33.416
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

431
00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:36.210
It's not enough to collect the '90s,
you have to bring them back to life.

432
00:34:36.502 --> 00:34:39.005
Dr. Cocteau said everything within our power.

433
00:34:39.088 --> 00:34:40.673
I can't think of a better idea.

434
00:34:40.756 --> 00:34:42.926
That doesn't mean it's a good one.

435
00:34:44.428 --> 00:34:48.098
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

436
00:34:48.265 --> 00:34:51.518
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

437
00:34:51.602 --> 00:34:52.728
Detective?

438
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.026
Detective, I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

439
00:34:58.693 --> 00:35:00.403
The year is 2032.

440
00:35:01.446 --> 00:35:03.948
The reason you have been released is--

441
00:35:04.115 --> 00:35:05.950
How long have I been under?

442
00:35:08.204 --> 00:35:09.622
Thirty-six years.

443
00:35:12.791 --> 00:35:14.293
I had a wife.

444
00:35:14.752 --> 00:35:16.629
What happened to my wife?

445
00:35:18.047 --> 00:35:21.343
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

446
00:35:26.556 --> 00:35:27.891
She died.

447
00:35:28.892 --> 00:35:30.602
In an earthquake.

448
00:35:31.144 --> 00:35:32.730
The earthquake.

449
00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:36.817
I had a daughter.

450
00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.071
I made a promise. What happened to her?

451
00:35:40.154 --> 00:35:41.239
John Spartan.

452
00:35:41.322 --> 00:35:43.491
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

453
00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:46.245
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

454
00:35:46.995 --> 00:35:51.250
Consider it fortunate the lieutenant
even bothered to do a probe on your wife.

455
00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:54.086
This is about you
and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

456
00:35:54.169 --> 00:35:55.254
What?

457
00:35:55.671 --> 00:36:00.093
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from
this cryo-facility. We've had 11 MurderDeathKills...

458
00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.344
...so far.

459
00:36:02.345 --> 00:36:05.598
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

460
00:36:05.765 --> 00:36:09.186
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

461
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.938
...to deal with this situation.

462
00:36:11.021 --> 00:36:15.025
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes
in San Angeles for 16 years.

463
00:36:15.192 --> 00:36:16.277
Where?

464
00:36:16.443 --> 00:36:20.739
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 2011.

465
00:36:20.948 --> 00:36:22.993
You are in the center of what used to be Los Angeles.

466
00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:25.871
That's great.

467
00:36:27.372 --> 00:36:29.875
- You, get me a Marlboro.
- Yes, of course. Right away.

468
00:36:31.793 --> 00:36:33.128
What's a Marlboro?

469
00:36:33.211 --> 00:36:35.381
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

470
00:36:36.716 --> 00:36:40.720
Smoking is not good for you. And it's been
deemed that anything not good for you is bad.

471
00:36:41.554 --> 00:36:45.349
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat--

472
00:36:45.558 --> 00:36:46.977
Are you shitting me?

473
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:51.523
"John Spartan, you are fined one credit
for violation of the verbal-morality statute"

474
00:36:52.482 --> 00:36:54.401
What the hell is that?

475
00:36:54.568 --> 00:36:57.487
"John Spartan, you are fined one credit...."
- Bad language...

476
00:36:57.654 --> 00:37:01.242
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and anything spicy.

477
00:37:01.409 --> 00:37:05.079
Abortion is also illegal, but then again
so is pregnancy if you don't have a license.

478
00:37:05.163 --> 00:37:06.289
Caveman...

479
00:37:06.414 --> 00:37:09.500
...let's finish with the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

480
00:37:09.584 --> 00:37:12.087
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

481
00:37:14.173 --> 00:37:16.509
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

482
00:37:16.592 --> 00:37:20.513
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble.

483
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.515
Thanks, but no thanks.

484
00:37:22.681 --> 00:37:26.186
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

485
00:37:26.269 --> 00:37:29.689
...and immediate assignment
to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.

486
00:37:29.856 --> 00:37:30.857
Or...

487
00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:35.279
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

488
00:37:35.613 --> 00:37:38.533
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

489
00:37:44.415 --> 00:37:45.415
Here you go.

490
00:37:47.416 --> 00:37:49.753
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

491
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.339
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

492
00:37:53.048 --> 00:37:54.424
Where's your John Spartan?

493
00:37:54.925 --> 00:37:58.512
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

494
00:38:02.725 --> 00:38:04.978
Sir, I formally convey my presence.

495
00:38:07.438 --> 00:38:08.898
How are you doing?

496
00:38:09.274 --> 00:38:11.943
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

497
00:38:12.528 --> 00:38:13.779
Look, I don't know...

498
00:38:13.863 --> 00:38:15.781
...if you guys know it but you're...

499
00:38:16.866 --> 00:38:18.868
...you're out of toilet paper.

500
00:38:20.286 --> 00:38:22.121
Did you say "toilet paper"?

501
00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:26.835
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

502
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:29.045
...back in the 20th.

503
00:38:31.464 --> 00:38:34.968
I'm happy that you're happy, but the place
where you're supposed to have the toilet paper...

504
00:38:35.135 --> 00:38:37.805
...you've got this little shelf with three seashells on it.

505
00:38:39.223 --> 00:38:41.893
He doesn't know how to use the three seashells.

506
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:47.815
I can see how that'd be confusing.

507
00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:50.485
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

508
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.290
No. Zach?

509
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:57.367
Zach Lamb?

510
00:38:58.577 --> 00:39:00.162
What happened to you?

511
00:39:01.413 --> 00:39:02.874
I got older.

512
00:39:03.333 --> 00:39:05.919
My God, I remember when you were...

513
00:39:06.336 --> 00:39:07.629
...a snotnosed rookie pilot.

514
00:39:07.712 --> 00:39:09.672
They finally grounded me.

515
00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.342
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

516
00:39:12.884 --> 00:39:17.348
"You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute"

517
00:39:17.681 --> 00:39:19.475
I'll be right back.

518
00:39:19.808 --> 00:39:21.477
They seem to be friends, yet...

519
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.979
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

520
00:39:24.063 --> 00:39:28.568
If you'd read my study, you'd know
this is how insecure heterosexual males used to bond.

521
00:39:28.902 --> 00:39:30.362
I knew that.

522
00:39:30.695 --> 00:39:34.783
Thanks a lot you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

523
00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:38.621
- ...pain in the ass.
"You're fined five credits..."

524
00:39:38.704 --> 00:39:41.457
"...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute"

525
00:39:41.541 --> 00:39:43.376
So much for the seashells.

526
00:39:43.793 --> 00:39:45.878
See you in a few minutes.

527
00:39:49.715 --> 00:39:51.885
"Voice check, Lenina Huxley"

528
00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:54.888
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

529
00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:57.808
While you were sleeping everyone
in the city was installed a code.

530
00:39:57.891 --> 00:40:01.979
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organically bio-engineered microchip...

531
00:40:02.229 --> 00:40:03.481
...is sewn into the skin.

532
00:40:03.565 --> 00:40:06.818
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

533
00:40:06.901 --> 00:40:10.738
I can't even conceive a visual of what you
police officers did before it was developed.

534
00:40:10.822 --> 00:40:13.950
We worked for a living. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

535
00:40:14.117 --> 00:40:16.370
What do you think you're scratching, caveman?

536
00:40:16.996 --> 00:40:19.748
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

537
00:40:19.832 --> 00:40:22.251
Your code was implanted
the second you thawed.

538
00:40:22.334 --> 00:40:24.837
Why didn't you just shove a leash up my ass?

539
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.839
You dirty meat-eater!

540
00:40:27.631 --> 00:40:29.759
No matter how Viking your era was...

541
00:40:29.843 --> 00:40:32.888
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

542
00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:35.974
You're going back, John Spartan,
oh yes, you're going back!

543
00:40:36.057 --> 00:40:38.852
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

544
00:40:39.102 --> 00:40:41.272
We need every cortex we can get in this situation.

545
00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:43.274
We don't need the Neanderthal.

546
00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:46.194
Our computer has already examined
every feasable scenario...

547
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.821
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

548
00:40:48.905 --> 00:40:52.868
It's determined he'll attempt to set up
a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

549
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:55.620
"That is correct, Chief George Earle"

550
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:57.623
Look, I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds...

551
00:40:57.748 --> 00:40:59.458
...but that's really fucking stupid.

552
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:01.835
You think he wants to start a business?

553
00:41:01.919 --> 00:41:03.837
Phoenix is going for a gun.

554
00:41:03.962 --> 00:41:05.465
Plain and simple.

555
00:41:06.049 --> 00:41:07.300
Trust me.

556
00:41:07.634 --> 00:41:08.843
He's going for a gun.

557
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:11.304
Who cares what this primate thinks?

558
00:41:11.596 --> 00:41:13.389
Resonate some understanding.

559
00:41:13.473 --> 00:41:16.976
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

560
00:41:17.686 --> 00:41:19.230
...is at a museum.

561
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.697
"Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History"

562
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.785
"Beneath you will see an excavation..."

563
00:41:31.868 --> 00:41:34.871
"...of an actual 20th-century street scene..."

564
00:41:35.163 --> 00:41:38.959
"...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010"

565
00:41:41.086 --> 00:41:44.924
"For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit...."

566
00:41:45.174 --> 00:41:47.718
"Firearms are displayed in the Armory..."

567
00:41:47.927 --> 00:41:49.845
"...located on Level A"

568
00:41:52.306 --> 00:41:55.060
"You are now entering the Hall of Violence..."

569
00:41:55.227 --> 00:41:58.939
"...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent..."

570
00:41:59.106 --> 00:42:01.525
"...during the late 20th century"

571
00:42:02.192 --> 00:42:03.902
Home, sweet home.

572
00:42:07.615 --> 00:42:12.120
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to locate the cache of firearms, it would...

573
00:42:12.287 --> 00:42:14.414
...it would be impossible for him to remove them.

574
00:42:14.497 --> 00:42:18.209
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

575
00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:20.713
It's just a hunch, so trust me on this.

576
00:42:20.963 --> 00:42:22.381
It's a cop thing.

577
00:42:22.548 --> 00:42:24.174
And what am I, a frog?

578
00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.720
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

579
00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.646
- I'll drive.
- I see.

580
00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:36.646
"Resetting all bio-links for new driver"

581
00:42:36.897 --> 00:42:39.274
"Weight, height, peripheral vision set"

582
00:42:39.649 --> 00:42:41.318
"If you would like..."

583
00:42:41.484 --> 00:42:45.907
"...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now"

584
00:42:46.365 --> 00:42:47.742
You drive.

585
00:42:53.039 --> 00:42:55.041
"Welcome, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley"

586
00:43:06.386 --> 00:43:09.515
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

587
00:43:09.682 --> 00:43:11.935
...things aren't all that different.

588
00:43:12.018 --> 00:43:14.437
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station? Oldies?

589
00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.564
"Oh, what a relief it is"

590
00:43:16.856 --> 00:43:19.025
This is the most popular station in town.

591
00:43:19.108 --> 00:43:21.779
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials".

592
00:43:21.862 --> 00:43:24.031
"Here's that classic you've all been waiting for."

593
00:43:24.114 --> 00:43:27.034
"The number one request of the day:
'Armour Hot Dogs' "

594
00:43:27.035 --> 00:43:27.835
Yes.

595
00:43:27.868 --> 00:43:29.870
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs..."

596
00:43:30.079 --> 00:43:31.747
Oh, wow. This is my fave!

597
00:43:32.206 --> 00:43:34.334
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks..."

598
00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:37.295
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

599
00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:39.214
"...chicken pox love hot dogs"

600
00:43:39.297 --> 00:43:40.966
"Armour Hot Dogs"

601
00:43:41.424 --> 00:43:43.718
"The dogs kids love to bite."

602
00:43:50.726 --> 00:43:53.271
Somebody put me back in the fridge.

603
00:43:55.439 --> 00:43:58.068
"You are now entering the Armory exhibit"

604
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.863
"You will find displays
in the cabinets and walls....

605
00:44:01.947 --> 00:44:04.366
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

606
00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:07.869
Sweet baby.

607
00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.624
Oh, shit.

608
00:44:21.134 --> 00:44:23.137
This is what I'm talking about.

609
00:44:23.337 --> 00:44:24.922
How do I get in here?

610
00:44:24.939 --> 00:44:29.602
Hey, hey, do you got to wait that 15-day waitin' period?
Or can I just, like, take one now?

611
00:44:31.353 --> 00:44:32.855
Motherfucker.

612
00:44:38.778 --> 00:44:40.238
Oh, fuck it.

613
00:44:40.655 --> 00:44:42.073
Mellow greetings.

614
00:44:42.449 --> 00:44:44.284
What seems to be your boggle?

615
00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:45.744
My "boggle"?

616
00:44:51.175 --> 00:44:52.802
How much do you weigh?

617
00:44:53.102 --> 00:44:54.629
Well, I happen to weigh--

618
00:45:02.012 --> 00:45:04.556
"Please vacate the museum, patrons"

619
00:45:05.015 --> 00:45:06.058
"Be calm"

620
00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:08.435
"Please vacate..."

621
00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:11.063
"...the museum, patrons. Be calm"

622
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.775
Wait a minute, this is the future.

623
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.944
Where are all the phaser guns?

624
00:45:21.199 --> 00:45:22.784
Mellow greetings, sir.

625
00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:24.536
What's your boggle?

626
00:45:31.168 --> 00:45:33.337
"Warning, please exit rapidly"

627
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.967
"The magnetic accelerator gun,
the last produced hand-held weapon..."

628
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.178
"...of this millennium,
displaced the flow of neutrons..."

629
00:45:40.262 --> 00:45:43.848
"...through a nonlinear cycloid
electromagnetic accumulator"

630
00:45:44.182 --> 00:45:45.976
So, what? It needs batteries?

631
00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:49.230
What size? Where the fuck do
you find batteries in the future?

632
00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:51.232
Is there a battery store around, motherfucker?

633
00:45:51.315 --> 00:45:53.234
Excuse me, museum patron. Can I--

634
00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:57.238
Where's Radio Shack?

635
00:46:03.579 --> 00:46:05.289
Sweet music to my ears.

636
00:46:05.622 --> 00:46:09.835
"...activated, the magnetic accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes"

637
00:46:10.252 --> 00:46:14.257
Yeah, well, I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

638
00:46:26.896 --> 00:46:28.272
Did you see that?

639
00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:29.356
What?

640
00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.735
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

641
00:46:33.569 --> 00:46:36.071
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

642
00:46:41.286 --> 00:46:43.413
Access and correlate procedure.

643
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:45.999
Establish communication with maniac intruder.

644
00:46:46.124 --> 00:46:47.250
Wrong.

645
00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:50.338
- Hey, Luke Skywalker. Use the Force.
- Oh, dear.

646
00:46:50.588 --> 00:46:53.716
- What the hell is this?
- It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

647
00:46:53.799 --> 00:46:55.009
Does it work?

648
00:46:58.813 --> 00:47:00.164
Guess so.

649
00:47:00.431 --> 00:47:02.225
They have him trapped in Section 8.

650
00:47:02.308 --> 00:47:04.519
I doubt it, Huxley. Make sure that building's clear.

651
00:47:04.603 --> 00:47:06.063
Done. I want a visual, now!

652
00:47:06.146 --> 00:47:09.733
Every corridor of the museum, I want full
sensors routed to me. I want it 90 seconds ago.

653
00:47:12.527 --> 00:47:15.114
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

654
00:47:16.324 --> 00:47:19.661
"Museum patron,
you are now confined to the Armory"

655
00:47:22.538 --> 00:47:25.875
"Museum patron,
you are now confined to the Armory"

656
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.343
"The Armory exhibit is now sealed"

657
00:47:35.177 --> 00:47:39.098
"All museum patrons still occupying
the facility should remain calm"

658
00:47:40.475 --> 00:47:42.185
"Help is imminent"

659
00:47:46.064 --> 00:47:48.483
This museum is no longer sealed, is it?

660
00:47:49.526 --> 00:47:51.821
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

661
00:47:51.904 --> 00:47:53.739
You should've stayed there.

662
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:56.534
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

663
00:48:00.496 --> 00:48:02.206
Bad aim, Blondie.

664
00:48:02.373 --> 00:48:03.874
Spartan? John Spartan?

665
00:48:04.209 --> 00:48:07.671
Oh shit. They let anybody into this century!
What the hell are you doing here?

666
00:48:11.341 --> 00:48:12.801
Simon says: Bleed!

667
00:48:15.596 --> 00:48:17.181
Great. Just great.

668
00:48:17.307 --> 00:48:19.100
You're making it too easy for me, Phoenix.

669
00:48:19.225 --> 00:48:21.394
Come on, you space-age piece of shit!

670
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:23.688
So, let me get this right.

671
00:48:23.771 --> 00:48:28.225
They defrosted you just so you could lasso
my piddly ass? Damn, you been had!

672
00:48:29.236 --> 00:48:32.031
I been dreaming about killing you for 40 years.

673
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.243
Well, keep dreaming!

674
00:49:35.557 --> 00:49:37.559
"AcMag now re-activated"

675
00:49:37.643 --> 00:49:38.894
About time.

676
00:49:38.978 --> 00:49:40.187
Past is over, John!

677
00:49:40.312 --> 00:49:42.022
Time for something new and improved!

678
00:49:42.106 --> 00:49:43.441
Oh, hell.

679
00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:50.123
Holy Shit! I love this gun! Goddamn!

680
00:49:56.956 --> 00:49:58.833
How you liking the future, John?

681
00:50:10.804 --> 00:50:11.972
Come on!

682
00:50:20.023 --> 00:50:20.899
Oh, I know that must have hurt!

683
00:50:20.982 --> 00:50:22.692
Huh, Soldier Boy?

684
00:50:24.277 --> 00:50:25.361
You're on TV!

685
00:50:25.445 --> 00:50:26.529
Shit!

686
00:50:33.913 --> 00:50:34.997
You're dead, Spartan!

687
00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.041
Forgot to say: "Simon says"

688
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:43.213
Oh, shit.

689
00:50:43.297 --> 00:50:44.633
Damn.

690
00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.596
It's a brave new world. Sorry, you gotta go!

691
00:50:49.721 --> 00:50:50.889
Shit!

692
00:51:21.171 --> 00:51:24.634
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

693
00:51:25.718 --> 00:51:28.221
Someone will pay dearly for this.

694
00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:36.230
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

695
00:51:38.315 --> 00:51:41.443
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

696
00:51:42.027 --> 00:51:44.446
Don't worry. I'll get you with the next shot.

697
00:51:46.241 --> 00:51:47.826
I don't think so.

698
00:51:49.995 --> 00:51:52.163
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

699
00:51:53.623 --> 00:51:55.625
And you were doing so well.

700
00:51:56.626 --> 00:51:58.796
Now, don't you have a job to do?

701
00:51:59.714 --> 00:52:03.342
Isn't there a thought repeating
in that barbaric brain of yours?

702
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.761
The name Friendly.

703
00:52:05.928 --> 00:52:07.722
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

704
00:52:08.222 --> 00:52:10.600
Don't you have someone to kill?

705
00:52:18.317 --> 00:52:20.319
- Yeah, I do.
- Excellent.

706
00:52:21.945 --> 00:52:23.948
Then go and do your job.

707
00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:27.493
Shit.

708
00:52:27.702 --> 00:52:29.454
Saved by the bell.

709
00:52:35.586 --> 00:52:36.754
Shit!

710
00:52:45.971 --> 00:52:47.139
Damn!

711
00:52:49.517 --> 00:52:51.686
You don't know how lucky you are
that maniac didn't whack you.

712
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:56.316
Well, I must say that "whacking",
whatever it is, sounds most disagreeable.

713
00:52:57.192 --> 00:52:59.027
Well, you scared him away.

714
00:52:59.152 --> 00:53:01.906
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

715
00:53:01.989 --> 00:53:03.407
No problem.

716
00:53:05.868 --> 00:53:07.995
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

717
00:53:08.746 --> 00:53:11.707
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

718
00:53:11.916 --> 00:53:14.086
He's finally matched his meat.

719
00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:16.338
You really licked his ass.

720
00:53:17.422 --> 00:53:19.258
That's "met his match"...

721
00:53:19.383 --> 00:53:21.426
...and "kicked his ass".

722
00:53:22.052 --> 00:53:24.638
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

723
00:53:25.598 --> 00:53:27.016
Captain Earle....

724
00:53:27.558 --> 00:53:29.227
Who is this man?

725
00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:34.107
Detective John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

726
00:53:34.274 --> 00:53:37.111
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

727
00:53:38.445 --> 00:53:41.740
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture the madman.

728
00:53:41.949 --> 00:53:43.659
Yes, I did. I did.

729
00:53:43.993 --> 00:53:47.037
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

730
00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.709
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

731
00:53:51.668 --> 00:53:53.420
That's quite all right.

732
00:53:53.503 --> 00:53:55.255
Unexpected. Creative.

733
00:53:56.506 --> 00:53:57.966
But quite all right.

734
00:53:58.049 --> 00:53:59.968
John Spartan, welcome.

735
00:54:01.011 --> 00:54:03.180
In honor of your arrival and your...

736
00:54:03.264 --> 00:54:05.683
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

737
00:54:05.766 --> 00:54:07.476
...namely my own...

738
00:54:07.602 --> 00:54:10.313
...I'd like to invite you to join me
for dinner tonight.

739
00:54:10.396 --> 00:54:11.564
Both of you.

740
00:54:11.647 --> 00:54:13.107
Please, I insist.

741
00:54:13.357 --> 00:54:15.527
I would like you to accompany me...

742
00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:17.321
...to Pizza Hut.

743
00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.743
Looking forward to it. Thanks.

744
00:54:28.958 --> 00:54:30.335
"Pizza Hut"?

745
00:54:33.796 --> 00:54:35.673
So let me get this right:

746
00:54:35.798 --> 00:54:39.720
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

747
00:54:39.803 --> 00:54:42.222
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...

748
00:54:42.306 --> 00:54:44.016
...though Lord knows I wouldn't mind a pizza...

749
00:54:44.099 --> 00:54:45.976
...is also one of the guys who built the goddamn cryo-prison?

750
00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.437
"John Spartan, you are fined...."

751
00:54:48.729 --> 00:54:51.650
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in San Angeles.

752
00:54:51.816 --> 00:54:54.527
He practically created our whole way
of life...

753
00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:55.987
...savage.

754
00:54:56.613 --> 00:54:57.906
He can have it.

755
00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:00.450
Now, Phoenix could be anywhere...

756
00:55:00.533 --> 00:55:02.243
...but not being coded can hurt him
and limit his options.

757
00:55:02.327 --> 00:55:04.413
That is correct. Money is outmoded.

758
00:55:04.497 --> 00:55:06.540
All transactions are through codes.

759
00:55:06.624 --> 00:55:09.377
All right, so actually he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

760
00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.129
It'd be a waste of time to mug somebody.

761
00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:15.258
Unless he rips off someone's hand,
let's hope he doesn't figure that one out.

762
00:55:15.341 --> 00:55:17.386
But with all officers already patrolling in a citywide crisis net...

763
00:55:17.469 --> 00:55:20.806
...it should be just a matter of tick-tocks before we actually--

764
00:55:20.832 --> 00:55:23.892
More importantly. We already have a backup plan.

765
00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.479
We can just wait for another code to go red.

766
00:55:27.938 --> 00:55:30.817
And when Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

767
00:55:30.984 --> 00:55:33.736
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

768
00:55:34.237 --> 00:55:35.113
Great plan.

769
00:55:35.196 --> 00:55:36.572
Thank you.

770
00:55:42.496 --> 00:55:45.791
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time now.

771
00:55:45.874 --> 00:55:50.004
I have, in fact, perused some visuals from the
Schwarzenegger Library. That time you took that car ...

772
00:55:50.504 --> 00:55:51.588
Hold it.

773
00:55:52.506 --> 00:55:54.217
"The Schwarzenegger Library"?

774
00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:57.095
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

775
00:55:57.345 --> 00:55:58.847
Wasn't he an actor, when you--

776
00:55:59.014 --> 00:56:00.724
Stop! He was President?

777
00:56:01.266 --> 00:56:05.605
Yes. Even though he wasn't born in this country, his popularity
at the time caused the 61st Amendment, which states...

778
00:56:05.896 --> 00:56:07.773
I don't want to know.

779
00:56:09.859 --> 00:56:11.235
President?

780
00:56:20.746 --> 00:56:23.040
What's the hell is this?
No door? No welcome mat?

781
00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:26.877
What is this?

782
00:56:30.048 --> 00:56:32.634
How do they expect you to kill somebody down here?

783
00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:38.389
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

784
00:56:38.723 --> 00:56:40.892
All right. A job is a job.

785
00:56:42.603 --> 00:56:46.899
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

786
00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:51.737
So, what's with Cocteau guy anyway?

787
00:56:52.404 --> 00:56:55.200
He says I saved his life,
which I'm not even sure I did.

788
00:56:55.283 --> 00:56:58.244
And my reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut?

789
00:56:58.495 --> 00:57:01.373
I mean, hey, I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but come on....

790
00:57:01.581 --> 00:57:03.667
Your tone is quasi-facetious, but...

791
00:57:04.167 --> 00:57:07.713
...you do not realise, that Pizza Hut was the
only restaurant to survive the Franchise Wars.

792
00:57:07.838 --> 00:57:08.923
So?

793
00:57:09.882 --> 00:57:12.051
So, now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.

794
00:57:13.594 --> 00:57:14.845
No way.

795
00:57:24.481 --> 00:57:26.358
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

796
00:57:26.984 --> 00:57:28.610
Enjoy your meal, sir.

797
00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:32.740
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

798
00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:37.662
"Good things from the garden"

799
00:57:37.912 --> 00:57:39.789
"Garden in the valley"

800
00:57:40.415 --> 00:57:42.917
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

801
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:48.299
Here comes the Neanderthal.

802
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:51.760
Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant....

803
00:57:51.885 --> 00:57:53.012
Thank you.

804
00:57:56.141 --> 00:57:57.809
How are you doing?

805
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:02.355
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

806
00:58:03.189 --> 00:58:04.357
Good thing I'm hungry.

807
00:58:04.441 --> 00:58:08.904
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you
to raise your glasses to the hero of the hour...

808
00:58:09.488 --> 00:58:11.073
...my savior...

809
00:58:11.198 --> 00:58:13.326
...Detective John Spartan.

810
00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:14.627
"John Spartan"

811
00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:16.996
Appreciate it.

812
00:58:20.166 --> 00:58:21.918
Greetings and salutations.

813
00:58:22.169 --> 00:58:23.754
I'm Associate Bob.

814
00:58:23.837 --> 00:58:27.507
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was groveling in fear at the time.

815
00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:30.552
You got the salt over there, Bob?

816
00:58:31.595 --> 00:58:34.599
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.

817
00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:36.768
So, John Spartan, tell me...

818
00:58:37.602 --> 00:58:40.521
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

819
00:58:41.273 --> 00:58:45.527
Well considering the way things were going when I went in,
I thought the future would be a rotting cesspool.

820
00:58:46.528 --> 00:58:49.698
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

821
00:58:49.782 --> 00:58:52.451
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

822
00:58:52.868 --> 00:58:55.871
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

823
00:58:56.372 --> 00:59:00.794
The citizenry cocooning in their homes, afraid to go out.
People just wanted the madness over.

824
00:59:02.003 --> 00:59:04.839
When I saw the chance
to make things right...

825
00:59:05.006 --> 00:59:06.466
...I seized it.

826
00:59:08.051 --> 00:59:11.973
If I had not, the radiance
of San Angeles would not be here.

827
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:17.103
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

828
00:59:17.395 --> 00:59:21.065
Maybe you can book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

829
00:59:21.232 --> 00:59:22.567
John Spartan...

830
00:59:22.734 --> 00:59:25.988
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

831
00:59:26.071 --> 00:59:27.489
...in jail before now.

832
00:59:27.572 --> 00:59:31.576
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

833
00:59:32.077 --> 00:59:34.371
...of the cryo-prison system?

834
00:59:35.248 --> 00:59:40.044
I don't want to spoil your dinner, pal, but
my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

835
00:59:40.211 --> 00:59:42.255
I had feelings and I had thoughts.

836
00:59:42.463 --> 00:59:46.217
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people caught in a burning building?

837
00:59:46.301 --> 00:59:48.345
You were awake? I don't think so.

838
00:59:48.429 --> 00:59:49.847
I do think so.

839
00:59:50.347 --> 00:59:54.268
And my wife beating her fists against a block
of ice that used to be her husband.

840
00:59:54.351 --> 00:59:58.939
Then you were nice enough to wake me up and let me know,
everything that meant something in my life is gone.

841
00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:03.570
It would have been more humane
to stake me down and leave me to the fucking crows.

842
01:00:04.738 --> 01:00:07.866
What would you say
if I called you a brutish fossil...

843
01:00:07.949 --> 01:00:11.411
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

844
01:00:12.913 --> 01:00:14.582
I don't know. "Thanks"?

845
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:17.460
I thought during rehabilitation...

846
01:00:17.627 --> 01:00:21.631
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

847
01:00:21.756 --> 01:00:23.758
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

848
01:00:23.841 --> 01:00:25.218
...are unavoidable.

849
01:00:25.302 --> 01:00:27.304
You were found guilty of criminal charges.

850
01:00:27.387 --> 01:00:29.473
You owed and still do owe a debt to society.

851
01:00:29.556 --> 01:00:30.807
So, there's nothing I can do.

852
01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:33.685
Yeah, there is. Call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

853
01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:35.228
John Spartan, where... Where are you going?

854
01:00:35.312 --> 01:00:39.233
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches again.

855
01:00:59.797 --> 01:01:00.965
Go for the truck!

856
01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:02.759
The food's in the truck!

857
01:01:05.553 --> 01:01:07.597
Grab the big box! Come on, move! Move!

858
01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:22.947
You're gonna regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

859
01:01:28.203 --> 01:01:29.371
Good night!

860
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.466
Get him!

861
01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.571
What a fucking hero. Come on.

862
01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:11.499
Please, don't.

863
01:02:17.465 --> 01:02:18.758
What the hell?

864
01:02:19.759 --> 01:02:21.427
Such reckless abandonment.

865
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.929
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

866
01:02:24.013 --> 01:02:26.307
That's "sheriff." Who were those guys?

867
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:28.435
They're known as "scraps".

868
01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:31.438
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

869
01:02:31.521 --> 01:02:34.107
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

870
01:02:35.108 --> 01:02:38.195
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

871
01:02:38.612 --> 01:02:40.406
They're nothing but thugs and hooligans.

872
01:02:40.782 --> 01:02:44.952
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

873
01:02:45.203 --> 01:02:48.581
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

874
01:02:48.915 --> 01:02:51.376
You're even better live than on laser disk.

875
01:02:51.459 --> 01:02:55.047
And the joy-joy way you paused to
make a glib witticism before doing battle...

876
01:02:55.214 --> 01:02:56.966
...with that strangely-weaponed Scrap--

877
01:02:57.132 --> 01:02:59.134
Huxley, look! This isn't the Wild West, okay?

878
01:02:59.218 --> 01:03:01.679
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

879
01:03:01.762 --> 01:03:03.597
Hurting people is not a good thing.

880
01:03:03.889 --> 01:03:05.558
Sometimes it is, but not...

881
01:03:05.642 --> 01:03:07.978
...when it's a bunch of people looking for something to eat.

882
01:03:16.444 --> 01:03:18.781
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

883
01:03:20.074 --> 01:03:21.325
Huxley coding off.

884
01:03:21.492 --> 01:03:22.618
Auto-drive.

885
01:03:22.702 --> 01:03:24.495
Auto-drive engaged.

886
01:03:30.002 --> 01:03:32.129
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you back there.

887
01:03:33.922 --> 01:03:36.258
No need to make a de-hurtful retraction.

888
01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:39.094
I just assimilated too much contraband.

889
01:03:39.386 --> 01:03:43.516
I fleshed you out as some
blow-up-the-bad-guy-with-a happy-grin-he-man type.

890
01:03:43.766 --> 01:03:49.229
But now I realise that you're the
moody-troubled-past-gunslinger-who-will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

891
01:03:49.355 --> 01:03:50.189
Huxley, stop.

892
01:03:50.273 --> 01:03:51.107
What?

893
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:53.443
I'm not any of that. I just do my job and things get--

894
01:03:53.526 --> 01:03:54.695
Demolished.

895
01:04:01.286 --> 01:04:05.914
You know, I keep been looking around,
and I think about my daughter growing up in a place like this.

896
01:04:06.166 --> 01:04:08.960
and I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm some kind of primitive.

897
01:04:09.127 --> 01:04:12.172
I mean, as much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

898
01:04:12.255 --> 01:04:14.883
Because I don't think I'm gonna fit into the picture very
well.

899
01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.468
Not very well at all.

900
01:04:18.846 --> 01:04:21.733
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers, but I...

901
01:04:21.734 --> 01:04:23.334
- ...I could do a search for you.
- No.

902
01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:29.940
Sorry.

903
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:36.448
Oh, subject change. I got what you wanted.

904
01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:37.741
Oh, great.

905
01:04:41.995 --> 01:04:43.373
What do you need that for?

906
01:04:44.457 --> 01:04:46.668
It's just one of those cop hunches again.

907
01:04:56.136 --> 01:04:57.388
Lights.

908
01:04:57.931 --> 01:05:00.683
Nah, I've changed that.

909
01:05:01.517 --> 01:05:02.935
Illuminate.

910
01:05:04.436 --> 01:05:05.854
Deluminate.

911
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.652
Isn't that nicer?

912
01:05:10.777 --> 01:05:12.445
Go ahead, you try it.

913
01:05:13.863 --> 01:05:15.281
Illuminate.

914
01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:20.496
Raymond, Raymond, we got to talk.

915
01:05:21.288 --> 01:05:22.915
How did you get in?

916
01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.418
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

917
01:05:26.293 --> 01:05:27.878
Routes to secret underground kingdoms.

918
01:05:27.962 --> 01:05:31.549
Complete access
to the industrial data-grid interface.

919
01:05:31.966 --> 01:05:34.136
I don't even know what that shit means.

920
01:05:34.303 --> 01:05:37.306
But I've been meaning to ask you
about it, because I like it!

921
01:05:37.389 --> 01:05:38.890
I like it a lot!

922
01:05:40.809 --> 01:05:43.228
Your skills were given you for a reason.

923
01:05:43.312 --> 01:05:45.732
Not for your personal amusement.

924
01:05:46.024 --> 01:05:50.886
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution before it precipitates.

925
01:05:50.945 --> 01:05:53.531
That is why you were rehabilitated.

926
01:05:56.576 --> 01:06:00.164
All right. I'm gonna do
your little dastardly deed for you.

927
01:06:01.081 --> 01:06:04.043
But it's gonna be a little bit more difficult than you thought.

928
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.420
And I'm going to need some help.

929
01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:10.008
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

930
01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:13.711
And I just so happen to have a list.

931
01:06:13.778 --> 01:06:17.932
You see, I wouldn't want you to defrost any of
those mad dog killer types, you know what I mean?

932
01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:21.854
And none of those motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

933
01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.899
So you're going to be the only mad dog killer type around?

934
01:06:25.961 --> 01:06:27.261
Exactamundo.

935
01:06:29.362 --> 01:06:30.446
Fine.

936
01:06:31.447 --> 01:06:32.823
Take care of it.

937
01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:35.786
Just get it over with.

938
01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:38.497
You're beginning to be more trouble than you're worth.

939
01:06:38.705 --> 01:06:40.957
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

940
01:06:42.793 --> 01:06:45.337
And what do I get out of all this?

941
01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:49.384
What do you want?

942
01:06:49.967 --> 01:06:50.968
Malibu.

943
01:06:51.886 --> 01:06:55.390
Santa Monica.
Hell, what about all the coastal cities?

944
01:06:56.975 --> 01:06:58.811
Well, I'll bear it in mind.

945
01:06:58.978 --> 01:07:01.981
- Good, I'll send you a memo.
- Just do your job!

946
01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:09.071
What is John Spartan doing here?

947
01:07:10.823 --> 01:07:12.993
Did you invite him to this little party of ours?

948
01:07:14.911 --> 01:07:16.997
Look, you finish your business...

949
01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:19.249
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

950
01:07:19.332 --> 01:07:21.584
Think of him as a guarantee.

951
01:07:21.835 --> 01:07:23.294
"A guarantee"?

952
01:07:24.088 --> 01:07:26.424
Well, you don't have much of a guarantee.

953
01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:30.302
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

954
01:07:33.597 --> 01:07:36.018
Now we need those men defrosted.

955
01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.357
So, this where you live, Huxley?

956
01:07:42.524 --> 01:07:43.942
Very not bad.

957
01:07:44.109 --> 01:07:45.235
Thank you.

958
01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.863
So, where will I be staying?

959
01:07:48.031 --> 01:07:51.409
Oh, I've procured you a domicile
down the corridor from my own.

960
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:57.790
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

961
01:07:57.874 --> 01:07:59.042
Lights.

962
01:08:00.627 --> 01:08:02.087
What do you think?

963
01:08:03.088 --> 01:08:06.800
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

964
01:08:06.884 --> 01:08:08.218
It's very....

965
01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:09.470
Isn't it?

966
01:08:12.306 --> 01:08:13.725
John Spartan....

967
01:08:15.344 --> 01:08:18.647
There's, of course, a well-known and documented...

968
01:08:18.813 --> 01:08:21.399
...connection between sex and violence.

969
01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:24.235
Not so much a causal effect...

970
01:08:24.402 --> 01:08:27.490
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

971
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:29.200
And...

972
01:08:29.492 --> 01:08:33.287
...after having observed
your behavior this evening and...

973
01:08:34.163 --> 01:08:36.415
...my resultant condition...

974
01:08:39.503 --> 01:08:42.506
...I was wondering
if you'd like to have sex?

975
01:08:47.844 --> 01:08:48.929
With you?

976
01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:49.930
Um-hum!

977
01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:52.517
Here?

978
01:08:53.601 --> 01:08:54.386
Now?

979
01:08:54.387 --> 01:08:55.287
Um-hum!

980
01:08:57.438 --> 01:08:58.356
Oh, yeah.

981
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.149
Great!

982
01:09:02.861 --> 01:09:04.363
I'll be right back.

983
01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:23.258
Love Boat?

984
01:09:42.863 --> 01:09:44.114
There you go.

985
01:09:49.703 --> 01:09:52.832
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

986
01:09:54.042 --> 01:09:55.376
Begin what?

987
01:09:56.044 --> 01:09:57.962
Having sex, of course.

988
01:10:56.776 --> 01:10:58.236
What's wrong? You broke contact.

989
01:10:58.403 --> 01:11:00.863
"Contact"? I didn't even touch you yet.

990
01:11:00.947 --> 01:11:03.116
But I thought you wanted to make love.

991
01:11:03.449 --> 01:11:05.034
Is that what you call this?

992
01:11:07.413 --> 01:11:12.042
Vir-sex has been proved to produce higher orders of
alpha waves during digitised transference of sexual energies.

993
01:11:12.251 --> 01:11:14.795
All right Huxley, what do you say we do it the old-fashioned way?

994
01:11:15.296 --> 01:11:17.131
Ugh, disgusting!

995
01:11:17.297 --> 01:11:18.466
You mean...

996
01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:24.155
- ...fluid transfer?
- No, I mean boning, the wild mambo, the hunka chunka.

997
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:26.641
That is no longer done.

998
01:11:26.975 --> 01:11:29.587
The exchange of bodily fluids,
do you know what that leads to?

999
01:11:29.612 --> 01:11:32.690
Yes, I do. Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

1000
01:11:32.773 --> 01:11:37.486
The rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one
of the major reasons  for the downfall of society.

1001
01:11:37.945 --> 01:11:41.073
After AIDS, there was NRS,
after NRS there was UBT.

1002
01:11:41.657 --> 01:11:44.786
One of the first things that Dr. Cocteau
was able to do was to outlaw...

1003
01:11:44.953 --> 01:11:48.957
...and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

1004
01:11:49.166 --> 01:11:51.835
Not even, not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

1005
01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:52.820
Kissing's not allowed?

1006
01:11:52.821 --> 01:11:53.421
Ah.

1007
01:11:53.503 --> 01:11:55.006
Damn, I was a good kisser.

1008
01:11:55.007 --> 01:11:56.007
Ughh!

1009
01:11:56.799 --> 01:11:58.134
All right, what about kids?

1010
01:11:58.676 --> 01:12:00.136
- Procreation?
- Yeah.

1011
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:01.971
We go to a lab.

1012
01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.265
Fluids are purified, screened...

1013
01:12:04.349 --> 01:12:07.644
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

1014
01:12:07.811 --> 01:12:09.688
It is the only legal way.

1015
01:12:13.150 --> 01:12:14.610
What're you doing?

1016
01:12:15.319 --> 01:12:16.737
Breaking the law.

1017
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.658
You are a savage creature, John Spartan.

1018
01:12:21.159 --> 01:12:23.703
And I wish you to leave my domicile, now!

1019
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:31.544
Look, in....

1020
01:12:52.025 --> 01:12:54.653
"Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan"

1021
01:13:04.872 --> 01:13:06.124
Lights.

1022
01:13:23.893 --> 01:13:26.771
"Oh, he doesn't know how
to use the three seashells."

1023
01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:35.281
Happy Halloween.

1024
01:14:06.773 --> 01:14:08.858
"Behavioral engineering"?

1025
01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:13.781
"Hi, Martin, you know, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number."

1026
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:29.714
"Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans."

1027
01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:33.009
"Someone will pay dearly for this."

1028
01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:40.142
"Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized."

1029
01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.772
"Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry."

1030
01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.357
"The next shot..."

1031
01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:48.151
"I don't think so."

1032
01:14:48.819 --> 01:14:50.987
"No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang."

1033
01:15:02.842 --> 01:15:03.942
Detective.

1034
01:15:04.043 --> 01:15:06.212
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

1035
01:15:08.172 --> 01:15:09.674
Here, I made this for you.

1036
01:15:13.554 --> 01:15:14.513
For me?

1037
01:15:15.214 --> 01:15:16.214
Yeah.

1038
01:15:17.224 --> 01:15:18.559
Thank you.

1039
01:15:21.895 --> 01:15:23.063
Oh, I'll drive.

1040
01:15:23.522 --> 01:15:25.900
I gotta learn to do this once in my life.

1041
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:26.901
Okay.

1042
01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:41.584
Thank you for the lovely gift.

1043
01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:47.256
Look, I don't know what you guys put in my cryo-slush,
but when I thawed out, the first thing I wanted to do was knit.

1044
01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:52.420
I mean, how come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle and a hook and bobbin, a petitpoint is?

1045
01:15:52.763 --> 01:15:55.682
I could weave a throw rug now
with my eyes closed.

1046
01:15:56.058 --> 01:15:58.143
It's part of your rehab program.

1047
01:15:58.226 --> 01:16:01.021
For each inmate the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

1048
01:16:01.104 --> 01:16:03.024
...which best suits to their genetic disposition.

1049
01:16:03.107 --> 01:16:04.817
It implants the knowledge...

1050
01:16:04.901 --> 01:16:07.987
...and the desire to carry out
whatever the training was assigned.

1051
01:16:09.614 --> 01:16:11.115
I'm a seamstress?

1052
01:16:11.574 --> 01:16:12.909
Oh, that's just great.

1053
01:16:13.076 --> 01:16:15.704
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

1054
01:16:15.788 --> 01:16:18.248
and Phoenix comes out, he can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

1055
01:16:18.332 --> 01:16:20.709
...knows the location
of every damn thing in town...

1056
01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:23.420
...and is three times stronger than he went in?

1057
01:16:25.965 --> 01:16:28.468
- Can you get me Phoenix's rehab program now?
- Sure.

1058
01:16:31.096 --> 01:16:34.015
- I'm a seamstress.
- Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1059
01:16:34.432 --> 01:16:36.101
"Access Simon Phoenix."

1060
01:16:36.643 --> 01:16:37.936
"Accessing..."

1061
01:16:38.671 --> 01:16:40.523
"Access denied!"

1062
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.025
- What?
"Security override"

1063
01:16:43.109 --> 01:16:44.652
This can't be right.

1064
01:16:48.489 --> 01:16:50.867
"Access granted, Officer Huxley."

1065
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:54.996
"Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile Rehab 65-R."

1066
01:16:55.831 --> 01:16:57.040
"Urban Combatkill."

1067
01:16:57.124 --> 01:16:59.501
"Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority."

1068
01:16:59.584 --> 01:17:01.545
"Survival Tactics"
- There must be a mistake.

1069
01:17:01.628 --> 01:17:05.007
"Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill."

1070
01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:07.260
"Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior."

1071
01:17:07.343 --> 01:17:10.221
- This isn't a proper rehabilitation program.
- No kidding.

1072
01:17:10.513 --> 01:17:12.390
This would create a monster.

1073
01:17:12.473 --> 01:17:14.100
Who develops these programs?

1074
01:17:14.183 --> 01:17:15.853
Well, Cocteau Industries, of course.

1075
01:17:16.645 --> 01:17:18.397
But why would the benevolent...

1076
01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.567
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

1077
01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:23.569
Well, that's a good question. Why don't we go ask him?

1078
01:17:23.652 --> 01:17:27.364
No, John Spartan. You do not accuse the
savior of our city of being connected with a...

1079
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:30.201
...multi-MurderDeathKiller like Simon Phoenix. It's...

1080
01:17:31.036 --> 01:17:32.328
...rude.

1081
01:17:32.662 --> 01:17:34.039
I'll be subtle.

1082
01:17:35.373 --> 01:17:36.875
I'm good at subtle.

1083
01:17:39.044 --> 01:17:40.546
"Mellow greetings"

1084
01:17:40.713 --> 01:17:42.214
"We are happy to welcome you..."

1085
01:17:42.339 --> 01:17:45.301
"...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex"

1086
01:17:45.384 --> 01:17:46.510
"Be well"

1087
01:17:46.677 --> 01:17:48.721
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

1088
01:17:54.019 --> 01:17:57.647
"Mellow apologies for my lack
of physical disposition, detective..."

1089
01:17:58.023 --> 01:17:59.941
"...but I do have an entire city-gov to run."

1090
01:18:00.025 --> 01:18:01.610
Well, run this.

1091
01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.281
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

1092
01:18:05.365 --> 01:18:07.950
And I don't think his escape
was an accident, either.

1093
01:18:08.034 --> 01:18:09.543
- Very subtle.
- Thank you.

1094
01:18:09.827 --> 01:18:12.038
Outside the museum,
why didn't he blow your brains out?

1095
01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:13.498
What did you say to him?

1096
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:15.917
"I honestly don't remember. Does it matter?"

1097
01:18:16.084 --> 01:18:18.337
Yeah, it matters. I saw the security disk.

1098
01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.216
He had a full 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your fucking head.

1099
01:18:22.424 --> 01:18:26.845
"John Spartan, this display of barbaric behavior
was unacceptable even in your time."

1100
01:18:29.265 --> 01:18:30.809
But it worked.

1101
01:18:35.339 --> 01:18:40.527
When a man like Phoenix has a gun to your head,
10 seconds is 9 and a half seconds longer than you get.

1102
01:18:41.444 --> 01:18:42.988
"Not everyone is as eager as you..."

1103
01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:46.575
"...to resort to violence
to solve all the difficulties in life."

1104
01:18:47.319 --> 01:18:52.998
"Even now, I begin to wonder if the chaos in the museum
was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own?"

1105
01:18:53.916 --> 01:18:55.377
Wonder about this...

1106
01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.670
...shithead.

1107
01:18:56.753 --> 01:19:00.298
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

1108
01:19:00.465 --> 01:19:01.800
...you don't.

1109
01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:05.896
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

1110
01:19:06.097 --> 01:19:07.097
John Spartan.

1111
01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.269
No, I didn't think so.

1112
01:19:12.412 --> 01:19:16.441
Detective, the only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

1113
01:19:16.607 --> 01:19:18.610
But that can be solved.

1114
01:19:18.777 --> 01:19:22.322
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

1115
01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:24.074
...your past is dead.

1116
01:19:24.491 --> 01:19:27.286
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

1117
01:19:27.619 --> 01:19:29.246
...enjoy your moment...

1118
01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:33.293
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

1119
01:19:33.376 --> 01:19:35.795
Like everything else in your life.

1120
01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:39.466
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

1121
01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.301
Be well.

1122
01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.055
Be fucked.

1123
01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.807
"You are fined one credit--"

1124
01:19:51.979 --> 01:19:55.149
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

1125
01:19:56.109 --> 01:19:57.444
I'll wait here.

1126
01:19:57.569 --> 01:19:58.528
Let's go.

1127
01:19:58.612 --> 01:20:01.239
- Oh, I don't know.
- Look, I do know. Now, turn that thing on.

1128
01:20:01.323 --> 01:20:03.492
I hope you know what you're doing.

1129
01:20:04.493 --> 01:20:06.995
But you're asking me to disobey a direct order.

1130
01:20:07.079 --> 01:20:09.082
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

1131
01:20:09.165 --> 01:20:13.169
Look, you do what you gotta do, I know what I gotta do.
I gotta nail that maniac and put him on ice or that's where I'm gonna be.

1132
01:20:13.378 --> 01:20:16.172
- Enhance your calm, John Spartan.
- Look, I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1133
01:20:16.255 --> 01:20:20.844
I'm gonna find that psycho Phoenix and enhance his calm.
And when I'm done, I'm gonna turn all my attention to that Cocteau.

1134
01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:25.182
Now, you don't have to come with me.
I can do this alone, okay?

1135
01:20:25.265 --> 01:20:29.703
Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to
escape, extinguish life and steal contraband weapons...

1136
01:20:29.728 --> 01:20:31.647
...why are you proceeding into the depths of wasteland?

1137
01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:35.902
The reason your city-wide manhunt didn't work
was because Phoenix was in the one place...

1138
01:20:36.069 --> 01:20:37.654
...a) you can't monitor...

1139
01:20:37.737 --> 01:20:40.740
...b) are afraid to go and c) don't give a shit about.

1140
01:20:41.408 --> 01:20:45.538
Now, I want to go down there, I want to find Phoenix
and I'm gonna put him in a hurt locker.

1141
01:20:46.314 --> 01:20:49.717
So, you want to come with me? Or you want to arrest me, huh?

1142
01:20:50.718 --> 01:20:51.718
Okay.

1143
01:20:52.086 --> 01:20:53.421
I'm with you.

1144
01:20:54.046 --> 01:20:55.756
Let's go blow this guy.

1145
01:20:58.218 --> 01:20:59.219
Away.

1146
01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:01.179
Blow this guy away.

1147
01:21:02.264 --> 01:21:03.390
Whatever.

1148
01:21:09.597 --> 01:21:11.349
She's got a way with words.

1149
01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:12.650
Ugh!

1150
01:21:17.113 --> 01:21:18.113
Ugh!

1151
01:21:18.114 --> 01:21:19.198
What's wrong, Huxley?

1152
01:21:19.282 --> 01:21:21.075
It's not very clean.

1153
01:21:25.748 --> 01:21:27.458
A real garden spot.

1154
01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:29.626
All right, which way Garcia?

1155
01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.086
Over there.

1156
01:21:31.295 --> 01:21:33.422
All right, guys, be ready for anything.

1157
01:21:41.598 --> 01:21:43.933
"My dog's better than your dog"

1158
01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.269
"My dog's better than yours"

1159
01:21:46.478 --> 01:21:49.607
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration. My dog's..."

1160
01:21:50.316 --> 01:21:52.777
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, I....

1161
01:21:53.277 --> 01:21:54.278
Sorry.

1162
01:21:54.987 --> 01:21:56.363
Over here.

1163
01:22:15.302 --> 01:22:17.302
-Ooh!
-Eew!

1164
01:22:17.303 --> 01:22:19.222
Oh, what's that emanation?

1165
01:22:19.623 --> 01:22:20.423
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:22:21.718 --> 01:22:22.918
Oh, yeah!

1167
01:22:24.019 --> 01:22:25.312
Come on, guys.

1168
01:22:32.954 --> 01:22:36.658
No, hey, just relax.
All I want is a burger and a beer, if you got one.

1169
01:22:38.868 --> 01:22:40.203
How am I gonna pay?

1170
01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:43.665
- Huxley, it's better to give.
- Ow!

1171
01:22:49.315 --> 01:22:50.715
Ah!

1172
01:22:51.716 --> 01:22:52.883
You wanna a slug?

1173
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:57.346
Oh, no, thank you.

1174
01:22:57.555 --> 01:22:59.390
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1175
01:22:59.682 --> 01:23:00.976
Oh, God.

1176
01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:03.937
This is fantastic. You guys gotta try one.

1177
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:06.732
Just don't ask where the meat comes from.

1178
01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:08.316
Huxley, what's that supposed to mean?

1179
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.485
Do you see any cows around here, detective?

1180
01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:20.204
Rat?

1181
01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.499
This is a rat burger?

1182
01:23:28.547 --> 01:23:29.757
Not bad.

1183
01:23:31.216 --> 01:23:33.635
As a matter of fact, it's the best burger I've had in years.

1184
01:23:36.388 --> 01:23:37.724
See you later.

1185
01:24:00.915 --> 01:24:03.752
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

1186
01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.254
No, they don't.

1187
01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:17.934
Now that's a thing of beauty.

1188
01:24:19.936 --> 01:24:21.562
Huxley, do you know what this is?

1189
01:24:21.646 --> 01:24:25.464
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1190
01:24:26.609 --> 01:24:29.504
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1191
01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.916
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1192
01:24:33.992 --> 01:24:35.327
I'm impressed.

1193
01:24:35.577 --> 01:24:36.703
I studied.

1194
01:24:36.787 --> 01:24:39.290
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.

1195
01:24:39.457 --> 01:24:41.626
Your friends, too. Come on, move!

1196
01:24:41.927 --> 01:24:42.627
Ow!

1197
01:24:46.328 --> 01:24:47.928
Ow!

1198
01:24:49.643 --> 01:24:52.263
You got ball-balls cop, coming down here after the show you put on.

1199
01:24:52.972 --> 01:24:55.099
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1200
01:24:55.182 --> 01:24:58.686
Can you help us or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

1201
01:25:03.524 --> 01:25:05.569
Well, maybe they're not so primitive.

1202
01:25:08.321 --> 01:25:09.948
So, you think you're taking me in, huh?

1203
01:25:10.031 --> 01:25:11.116
Guess what?

1204
01:25:11.199 --> 01:25:12.451
Not happening.

1205
01:25:12.459 --> 01:25:15.704
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1206
01:25:16.037 --> 01:25:18.416
You tell Cocteau, it's gonna take
an army of assholes to get rid of me...

1207
01:25:18.499 --> 01:25:20.793
...'cause I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

1208
01:25:20.877 --> 01:25:25.381
I don't wanna rain on your parade, pal, but I don't know
who the hell you are, let alone want to take you anywhere.

1209
01:25:25.882 --> 01:25:29.052
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

1210
01:25:30.179 --> 01:25:33.515
Let's take them and dump them up top.
They're only down here to spy on us.

1211
01:25:34.683 --> 01:25:35.934
Wait a minute.

1212
01:25:37.686 --> 01:25:39.897
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

1213
01:25:39.898 --> 01:25:40.898
Yeah.

1214
01:25:41.649 --> 01:25:43.068
What do you want?

1215
01:25:43.568 --> 01:25:46.029
I guess, you weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

1216
01:25:46.196 --> 01:25:49.491
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

1217
01:25:52.035 --> 01:25:54.413
- That's why everybody's down here?
- You got that right.

1218
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:55.581
See....

1219
01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.042
...according to Cocteau's plan...

1220
01:25:58.209 --> 01:26:00.711
...I'm an enemy because I like to think.

1221
01:26:01.045 --> 01:26:02.171
I like to read.

1222
01:26:02.254 --> 01:26:04.131
I'm into freedom of speech and freedom of choice.

1223
01:26:04.215 --> 01:26:05.842
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit in a greasy spoon...

1224
01:26:05.926 --> 01:26:10.222
...and wonder, "Gee, should I have the T-Bone steak or
the jumbo rack of barbecued ribs with a side order of gravy fries?"

1225
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:11.807
I want high cholesterol.

1226
01:26:11.890 --> 01:26:14.393
I want to eat bacon, and butter and buckets of cheese, okay?

1227
01:26:14.559 --> 01:26:17.312
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati in the non-smoking section.

1228
01:26:17.396 --> 01:26:20.316
I want to run through the streets
naked with green Jell-o all over my body...

1229
01:26:20.566 --> 01:26:23.778
...reading Playboy magazine. Why?
Because I suddenly might feel the need to, okay pal?

1230
01:26:23.945 --> 01:26:25.488
I've seen the future. You know what it is?

1231
01:26:25.571 --> 01:26:27.407
It's a 47-year-old virgin sitting around his beige pijamas...

1232
01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:30.536
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
and singing "I'm an Oscar Meyer Wiener".

1233
01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.162
Live up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1234
01:26:32.246 --> 01:26:34.415
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

1235
01:26:34.498 --> 01:26:36.750
Your other choice: Come down here.

1236
01:26:38.043 --> 01:26:39.628
Maybe starve to death.

1237
01:26:40.421 --> 01:26:43.716
All right, why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

1238
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.009
I'm no leader.

1239
01:26:45.218 --> 01:26:47.053
I do what I have to do.

1240
01:26:47.178 --> 01:26:48.763
Sometimes people come with me.

1241
01:26:48.847 --> 01:26:53.476
All I want to do is bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy-happy thoughts forever.

1242
01:26:53.852 --> 01:26:55.688
Then I got bad news.

1243
01:26:56.439 --> 01:26:58.649
I think he wants to kill you.

1244
01:27:01.444 --> 01:27:03.904
All right gentlemen, let's review.

1245
01:27:04.697 --> 01:27:06.073
The year is 2032.

1246
01:27:06.907 --> 01:27:09.661
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

1247
01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:15.867
And I'm sorry to say that
the world has become a pussy-whipped...

1248
01:27:16.084 --> 01:27:20.256
...Brady Bunch version of itself,
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1249
01:27:21.299 --> 01:27:24.093
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

1250
01:27:24.218 --> 01:27:28.139
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

1251
01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:31.894
Ah, but there's an extra added bonus.

1252
01:27:33.645 --> 01:27:35.147
We get to kill...

1253
01:27:35.314 --> 01:27:37.649
...the man who put most of us behind the freezer.

1254
01:27:37.816 --> 01:27:38.984
You mean...

1255
01:27:39.151 --> 01:27:40.903
...we get to kill John Spartan?

1256
01:27:40.986 --> 01:27:42.154
Exactly.

1257
01:27:42.488 --> 01:27:45.742
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder, I want you to steal.

1258
01:27:46.076 --> 01:27:50.538
I want you to do all the wonderful things
that we used to do before any of this happened.

1259
01:27:51.289 --> 01:27:53.333
This world will be ours!

1260
01:27:53.541 --> 01:27:55.376
Let's bring back the good old days!

1261
01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:56.837
Are you with me?

1262
01:27:57.246 --> 01:27:59.673
Are you with me? Let's do it!

1263
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:06.639
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

1264
01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:10.268
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1265
01:28:10.393 --> 01:28:14.523
Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send
out into the savage outer regions in which we stand.

1266
01:28:15.232 --> 01:28:17.192
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

1267
01:28:17.401 --> 01:28:20.028
You mean they thawed this guy out just to kill me?

1268
01:28:21.113 --> 01:28:24.242
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1269
01:28:24.492 --> 01:28:26.702
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1270
01:28:26.869 --> 01:28:28.871
- And that's why you're down here?
- Yeah.

1271
01:28:31.249 --> 01:28:34.837
I must have done something right
in the previous life.

1272
01:28:35.337 --> 01:28:37.840
Can't imagine what that could have been.

1273
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.510
Two for the price of one.

1274
01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.429
Let's take them boys.

1275
01:28:48.393 --> 01:28:49.727
Stay down!

1276
01:29:22.846 --> 01:29:25.767
I'll be goddamned.
Like a New York cockroach.

1277
01:29:55.507 --> 01:29:57.217
Everything's gone wrong.

1278
01:30:03.918 --> 01:30:05.118
Phoenix!

1279
01:30:13.735 --> 01:30:16.196
There's an elevator shaft on top of this place.

1280
01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:20.033
Does that mean we're going up?

1281
01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.786
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

1282
01:30:41.432 --> 01:30:44.143
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

1283
01:31:01.077 --> 01:31:02.329
Okay, now what?

1284
01:31:02.413 --> 01:31:03.789
Buckle up.

1285
01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:29.192
There he is! He's in my car!

1286
01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:36.657
Goddamn it.

1287
01:31:43.248 --> 01:31:45.417
What's happening to cops today?

1288
01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:48.128
Don't you know you are
endangering the lives of civilians?

1289
01:32:06.774 --> 01:32:07.650
Auto-inflate!

1290
01:32:07.733 --> 01:32:09.068
"Auto-inflate"

1291
01:32:11.069 --> 01:32:12.069
Damn!

1292
01:32:14.615 --> 01:32:15.742
Oh, that's just lovely.

1293
01:32:15.826 --> 01:32:17.327
Huxley, drive!

1294
01:32:17.469 --> 01:32:20.247
Okay, okay. I've read all about this, now... okay.

1295
01:32:22.833 --> 01:32:25.127
What do I do? I just, I just push this pedal?

1296
01:32:26.128 --> 01:32:27.128
Whoa!

1297
01:32:27.546 --> 01:32:29.132
Okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

1298
01:32:38.683 --> 01:32:40.017
Punch it, Huxley!

1299
01:32:40.269 --> 01:32:41.353
Excuse me?

1300
01:32:41.478 --> 01:32:43.981
Push the pedal as hard as you can!
Just catch up to him.

1301
01:32:53.576 --> 01:32:54.576
Shit!

1302
01:32:55.277 --> 01:32:56.628
No free rides!

1303
01:33:02.375 --> 01:33:03.960
Emergency, doors open.

1304
01:33:04.043 --> 01:33:05.296
"Doors opening"

1305
01:33:06.589 --> 01:33:08.299
Say hello to my old friend.

1306
01:33:20.562 --> 01:33:21.646
Doors close!

1307
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.898
"Malfunction"

1308
01:33:28.528 --> 01:33:30.406
Computer, auto-drive.

1309
01:33:30.656 --> 01:33:32.366
"Auto-drive engaged"

1310
01:33:32.533 --> 01:33:34.452
Going to give you a haircut!

1311
01:33:35.953 --> 01:33:38.122
Remember those 40 bus passengers...

1312
01:33:38.206 --> 01:33:40.625
...that you blew apart trying to catch me?

1313
01:33:42.002 --> 01:33:44.004
They were already dead.

1314
01:33:44.463 --> 01:33:46.298
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

1315
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:57.018
Man, I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

1316
01:33:58.228 --> 01:33:59.687
You're dead, Spartan.

1317
01:33:59.896 --> 01:34:01.689
Speak for yourself.

1318
01:34:10.908 --> 01:34:11.867
Self-drive!

1319
01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:13.702
"Unable to execute"

1320
01:34:13.994 --> 01:34:15.663
- Self-drive, now!
"Malfunction"

1321
01:34:15.746 --> 01:34:17.498
"Unable to execute"

1322
01:34:17.748 --> 01:34:18.917
Emergency!

1323
01:34:20.961 --> 01:34:22.087
Brake!

1324
01:34:23.421 --> 01:34:24.923
"Self-drive engaged"

1325
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:28.093
Brake! Brake!

1326
01:34:30.429 --> 01:34:33.391
Brake now, you
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

1327
01:35:06.135 --> 01:35:07.135
John Spartan?

1328
01:35:08.136 --> 01:35:09.847
John Spartan, are you in there?

1329
01:35:10.473 --> 01:35:11.473
John Spartan?

1330
01:35:11.474 --> 01:35:13.642
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1331
01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:24.988
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated!

1332
01:35:25.071 --> 01:35:27.324
Yeah, I thought I was history too.

1333
01:35:27.491 --> 01:35:31.244
What the hell happened? All the sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

1334
01:35:31.495 --> 01:35:34.290
It's secur-a-foam. It saved your life.

1335
01:35:34.499 --> 01:35:36.834
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1336
01:35:37.126 --> 01:35:40.505
Don't worry, I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

1337
01:35:40.838 --> 01:35:42.757
I really didn't say that, did I?

1338
01:35:42.858 --> 01:35:43.958
Damn!

1339
01:35:50.684 --> 01:35:55.187
John Spartan, you... You caveman, you're under arrest!

1340
01:35:55.771 --> 01:35:58.358
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!

1341
01:35:58.441 --> 01:36:01.152
I heard all about that. We'll talk later, Chief.

1342
01:36:01.703 --> 01:36:04.181
Right now, I need something, anything. A shotgun, a flare gun.

1343
01:36:04.182 --> 01:36:05.282
- Spartan.
- What?

1344
01:36:08.868 --> 01:36:09.744
Shit!

1345
01:36:09.912 --> 01:36:11.413
Defensive red alert!

1346
01:36:13.124 --> 01:36:14.542
Stun batons on.

1347
01:36:15.876 --> 01:36:17.086
Relax.

1348
01:36:18.045 --> 01:36:19.880
Well, look at you, you get a bump on the noggin...

1349
01:36:19.964 --> 01:36:22.133
...and you think you're Pancho Villa?

1350
01:36:22.634 --> 01:36:23.593
Who?

1351
01:36:24.094 --> 01:36:24.970
Never mind.

1352
01:36:25.053 --> 01:36:26.596
Time to take a stand, pal.

1353
01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.308
Well, good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.

1354
01:36:30.559 --> 01:36:34.480
You'd use these weapons of mass destruction
against men and women who uphold the law?

1355
01:36:34.689 --> 01:36:37.567
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

1356
01:36:37.734 --> 01:36:39.734
Spartan, wait!

1357
01:36:39.735 --> 01:36:41.112
You can't leave.

1358
01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:46.033
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

1359
01:36:46.242 --> 01:36:47.828
Skip it, Chief.

1360
01:36:48.287 --> 01:36:50.038
Lieutenant Huxley!

1361
01:36:50.372 --> 01:36:51.415
Chief...

1362
01:36:51.498 --> 01:36:54.868
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it. Hmm?

1363
01:36:57.212 --> 01:36:58.881
"Take this job...

1364
01:36:59.089 --> 01:37:00.933
"...and shovel it."
- Yeah?

1365
01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.761
Close enough.

1366
01:37:09.184 --> 01:37:13.522
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

1367
01:37:14.607 --> 01:37:16.525
People are terrified of you.

1368
01:37:16.859 --> 01:37:19.695
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

1369
01:37:19.779 --> 01:37:22.656
Yes, but this time they're really intimidated.

1370
01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.119
Now...

1371
01:37:26.411 --> 01:37:30.165
...I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

1372
01:37:31.833 --> 01:37:33.251
My society.

1373
01:37:34.169 --> 01:37:37.048
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1374
01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.468
...with the purity of an ant colony.

1375
01:37:41.302 --> 01:37:43.888
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1376
01:37:44.322 --> 01:37:46.891
Look, you can't take away people's right to be assholes.

1377
01:37:49.353 --> 01:37:50.854
That's who you remind me of...

1378
01:37:51.605 --> 01:37:53.232
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

1379
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.025
Will you please kill him?

1380
01:37:55.108 --> 01:37:56.652
He's pissing me off.

1381
01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:09.499
Put another log on the fire!

1382
01:38:11.084 --> 01:38:13.212
I'll love running this place!

1383
01:38:20.469 --> 01:38:21.929
Well, now...

1384
01:38:22.221 --> 01:38:25.273
...what shall I do with you. Huh, Bobby?

1385
01:38:26.184 --> 01:38:28.687
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1386
01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:33.233
I'd be delighted to continue my services
during your administration.

1387
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:35.735
Huh, Danzig, maybe we'll use him--

1388
01:38:35.819 --> 01:38:37.864
Excuse me, the police are here.

1389
01:38:39.115 --> 01:38:40.408
Oh, man!

1390
01:39:06.436 --> 01:39:08.521
Where the fuck do you think... Ow!

1391
01:39:26.624 --> 01:39:28.001
I'm impressed.

1392
01:39:41.557 --> 01:39:43.893
That man has died by my hands.

1393
01:39:44.602 --> 01:39:46.312
It was either him or us, Huxley.

1394
01:39:47.772 --> 01:39:49.273
Yeah, there is that.

1395
01:39:49.482 --> 01:39:51.734
Anyway, where the hell did you learn to kick like that?

1396
01:39:52.986 --> 01:39:54.780
Jackie Chan movies.

1397
01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:06.209
Looks like the Cocteau plan
just went up in smoke.

1398
01:40:06.668 --> 01:40:09.045
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1399
01:40:10.046 --> 01:40:14.008
Oh, John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

1400
01:40:15.051 --> 01:40:16.177
What will we do?

1401
01:40:16.261 --> 01:40:18.848
I don't know, but trust me, this is better for you.

1402
01:40:19.014 --> 01:40:20.474
What's that?

1403
01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:26.814
Oh, this is bad.

1404
01:40:27.106 --> 01:40:28.357
This is very bad.

1405
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:32.445
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and is about to defrost the entire multi-lifer wing.

1406
01:40:32.571 --> 01:40:34.072
Most of them don't like you.

1407
01:40:34.239 --> 01:40:37.742
Most of these guys don't even like
their own mothers. They're bad boys, Huxley.

1408
01:40:37.826 --> 01:40:39.286
How many are there?

1409
01:40:42.498 --> 01:40:43.499
Eighty.

1410
01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:45.209
All without rehab.

1411
01:40:45.293 --> 01:40:47.253
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

1412
01:40:47.336 --> 01:40:49.088
Oh, we gotta stop this.

1413
01:40:50.965 --> 01:40:55.387
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of that deranged cryo-convict.

1414
01:40:55.637 --> 01:40:59.850
I now understand that under certain
circumstances that violence is necessary.

1415
01:41:00.058 --> 01:41:01.226
Good.

1416
01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.109
I hope you understand this.

1417
01:41:17.076 --> 01:41:19.413
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1418
01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.333
Okay, who do we have left that's good, huh?

1419
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.667
Let's see...

1420
01:41:23.793 --> 01:41:25.294
...Foulks, Patrick.

1421
01:41:25.461 --> 01:41:27.963
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1422
01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.759
Look, we gotta get him.
How long before the rest are done?

1423
01:41:30.842 --> 01:41:32.844
They're in the final stages of reanimation, sir.

1424
01:41:32.928 --> 01:41:34.763
Great. Absolutely great.

1425
01:41:36.556 --> 01:41:37.682
Gentlemen!

1426
01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:41.686
Thank you very much, but your services
will no longer be required.

1427
01:41:48.778 --> 01:41:51.197
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1428
01:42:09.384 --> 01:42:10.718
"Attention"

1429
01:42:10.885 --> 01:42:12.262
"Attention"

1430
01:42:12.345 --> 01:42:15.140
"Cryo-prisoner defrosting
re-animation sequence..."

1431
01:42:15.223 --> 01:42:17.475
"...now entering final stage"

1432
01:42:19.394 --> 01:42:22.523
"Countdown to reanimation
of prisoner batches..."

1433
01:42:22.731 --> 01:42:26.525
"...290, 310, 480..."

1434
01:42:26.819 --> 01:42:28.070
"...and 570"

1435
01:42:28.404 --> 01:42:29.822
"Ten minutes"

1436
01:42:31.907 --> 01:42:34.578
- That's it. The very last one.
- Excellent.

1437
01:42:36.037 --> 01:42:37.372
"Accessed"

1438
01:42:39.082 --> 01:42:40.834
What the hell is that?

1439
01:43:17.415 --> 01:43:19.542
Didn't expect that one, did you?

1440
01:43:19.918 --> 01:43:21.336
Where the fuck you going?

1441
01:43:21.419 --> 01:43:23.339
I wish you the best of luck, sir.

1442
01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:25.341
Stupid.

1443
01:43:32.757 --> 01:43:34.768
Spartan, how's it hanging, huh?

1444
01:43:36.353 --> 01:43:39.481
I'm sure you're familiar
with the long arm of the law.

1445
01:43:44.486 --> 01:43:47.573
Oh, come on Spartan, won't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it, huh?

1446
01:43:47.657 --> 01:43:49.534
What do you say? How about...

1447
01:43:49.617 --> 01:43:52.703
...a little target practice. What do you say?

1448
01:44:00.921 --> 01:44:02.631
Oops, didn't hurt your head?

1449
01:44:22.944 --> 01:44:24.530
Shit! Goddamn!

1450
01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:33.038
Fuck!

1451
01:44:45.135 --> 01:44:46.511
That's it, Spartan!

1452
01:44:47.053 --> 01:44:49.265
You're not getting out of this one!

1453
01:44:52.268 --> 01:44:54.896
I could drop you in that vat of defrost, over there...

1454
01:44:55.062 --> 01:44:57.148
...and fry your ass like a chicken...

1455
01:44:58.357 --> 01:45:01.445
...or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass down--

1456
01:45:04.072 --> 01:45:05.657
I'll be goddamned.

1457
01:45:47.035 --> 01:45:48.328
Shit! Goddamn!

1458
01:45:48.578 --> 01:45:49.580
What am I doing wrong?

1459
01:45:49.789 --> 01:45:51.624
"Cryo-prisoner re-animation..."

1460
01:45:51.749 --> 01:45:54.460
"...sequence now entering final stage"

1461
01:46:01.133 --> 01:46:03.846
"Is it cold in here, or is it just me?"

1462
01:46:05.556 --> 01:46:07.015
Good memory.

1463
01:46:13.355 --> 01:46:14.649
Come here!

1464
01:46:15.066 --> 01:46:16.234
Shit!

1465
01:46:27.079 --> 01:46:28.539
I hate cops!

1466
01:46:32.877 --> 01:46:35.462
Look into my eyes, John. I'll see you in hell.

1467
01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:36.839
Not.

1468
01:47:20.053 --> 01:47:22.472
This is the best day of my life.

1469
01:47:52.922 --> 01:47:54.257
Heads up!

1470
01:48:45.228 --> 01:48:49.149
You've apprehended the villain responsible
for murdering our beloved Dr. Raymond Cocteau?

1471
01:48:49.357 --> 01:48:51.234
Well, I wouldn't exactly say "apprehend".

1472
01:48:51.401 --> 01:48:52.903
Let's just say he's history.

1473
01:48:53.153 --> 01:48:54.780
And the cryo-prison...

1474
01:48:54.906 --> 01:48:56.365
...that's history, too.

1475
01:48:59.327 --> 01:49:00.870
What'll we do?

1476
01:49:01.829 --> 01:49:02.955
How will we live?

1477
01:49:03.039 --> 01:49:06.793
I'll tell you what we're gonna do. We'll go out drinking,
all of us, get shit-faced and paint the town, literally.

1478
01:49:07.085 --> 01:49:08.996
Put up graffiti, slogans, it'll be a blast.

1479
01:49:08.997 --> 01:49:09.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1480
01:49:09.796 --> 01:49:11.256
I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do.

1481
01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:13.258
Why don't you get a little dirty...

1482
01:49:13.342 --> 01:49:15.093
...you, a lot clean.

1483
01:49:15.302 --> 01:49:17.429
And somewhere in the middle....

1484
01:49:18.222 --> 01:49:20.099
I don't know, you'll figure it out.

1485
01:49:20.433 --> 01:49:21.643
Fucking-A!

1486
01:49:24.812 --> 01:49:25.705
Well put.

1487
01:49:25.706 --> 01:49:27.406
Mister Friendly. Mister Friendly?

1488
01:49:27.690 --> 01:49:29.817
Greetings and salutations, Edgar Friendly.

1489
01:49:29.984 --> 01:49:32.363
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1490
01:49:32.530 --> 01:49:35.950
...it'll be a great pleasure
to assist you creating a more humane--

1491
01:49:35.951 --> 01:49:36.951
Bob, Bob.

1492
01:49:37.201 --> 01:49:38.953
- Let's talk about the hair, okay?
- Hair?

1493
01:49:39.036 --> 01:49:42.748
- Pick a color, right? And lose the kimono. You look like a couch.
- Couch?

1494
01:49:42.873 --> 01:49:45.418
What are you, a surgeon with these gloves?

1495
01:49:49.422 --> 01:49:52.050
Thank you for rendering me unconscious.

1496
01:49:54.052 --> 01:49:55.512
Huxley, I did it for your own good.

1497
01:49:55.595 --> 01:49:57.932
- We're supposed to be a team.
- We are.

1498
01:50:06.899 --> 01:50:08.150
Oh, my.

1499
01:50:08.944 --> 01:50:11.655
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?

1500
01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:13.448
- Better.
- Better?

1501
01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:15.909
Oh, my.

1502
01:50:19.329 --> 01:50:21.332
I think I'll like the future.

1503
01:50:21.499 --> 01:50:23.877
Now that you've demolished everything.

1504
01:50:24.119 --> 01:50:26.754
- But there's just one thing I want to know.
- Hmm?

1505
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.799
How's that damn
three seashell thing work?
