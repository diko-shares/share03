00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.607
MALE NARRATOR: My story
begins in London.

4
00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:08.526
Not so very long ago.

5
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.607
And yet so much
has happened since then,

6
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.285
that it seems more like an eternity.

7
00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:16.367
At that time, I lived with my pet

8
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.450
in a bachelor flat
just off Regent's Park.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.955
(PLAYING NOTES)

10
00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:23.457
It was a beautiful spring day

11
00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.457
a tedious time of the year
for bachelors.

12
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.876
Oh. That's my pet, Roger

13
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.463
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.

14
00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:35.470
(CHUCKLES) No. No,
I'm the one with the spots.

15
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.809
My name's Pongo.

16
00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:40.888
And you know as far as I could see,

17
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:44.976
the old notion that a bachelor's
life was so glamorous

18
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.977
and carefree was all nonsense.

19
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.446
It was downright dull.

20
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.487
(SIGHS)

21
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:04.249
It was plain to see
that my old pet needed someone.

22
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:08.332
But if it were left up to Roger;
we'd be bachelors forever.

23
00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:11.586
He was married to his work.
Writing songs.

24
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:13.591
Songs about romance, of all things,

25
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.640
something he knew
absolutely nothing about.

26
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.439
Oh, he's intelligent enough,
as humans go.

27
00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.186
And I think you could say

28
00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:27.856
that Roger is a rather
handsome animal in his way.

29
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:33.278
I could see no reason why my pet
didn't deserve an attractive mate.

30
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:38.529
At least, I was determined
to do my best.

31
00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:42.533
Of course, dogs are a pretty
poor judge of human beauty.

32
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:50.174
(SIGHS) But I had a rough idea
of what to look for

33
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.878
Hmm. Unusual breed.

34
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.512
(CHUCKLES) Very unusual.

35
00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.729
(CHUCKLES) Oh, surely not.

36
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.565
Well, now, what have we here?

37
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.064
Hmm.

38
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.358
Well, a little too short-coupled.

39
00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:17.363
Nope.

40
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.826
I say... Oh, well I do say!

41
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.078
Now, there's a fancy breed.

42
00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:29.588
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.

43
00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:33.838
Yes. That's much too fancy.

44
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.757
Too old.

45
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.763
Too young.

46
00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.431
It was a problem. A real problem.

47
00:05:46.096 --> 00:05:49.441
Well, now that's a bit more like it!

48
00:05:49.558 --> 00:05:52.858
The most beautiful
creature on four legs.

49
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.781
Oh, now, if only the girl...

50
00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.118
Well! She's very lovely, too.

51
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.112
It was almost too good to be true.

52
00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:05.832
I'd never End another pair like that,
not if I looked for 100 years.

53
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:11.000
Ah, they're heading for the park.

54
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.671
A perfect meeting place,
if I could only arrange it.

55
00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.133
Uh-oh. But Roger never
stopped work till after 5:00.

56
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.339
That would be too late.

59
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.325
After 5:00 already.

60
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.202

61
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:50.627

Pongo, boy, slow down.

68
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:48.639
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.

69
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.846
Then suddenly, I spotted them.

70
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.399
It was a perfect situation
if I planned it right.

71
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.315
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.

72
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.569
He'd settle on the grass,
puff his pipe and that would be it.

73
00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.322
No, it was all up to me.

74
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.450
Well...

75
00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:32.305
At first I had no particular plan,

76
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.602
just anything to attract attention.

77
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:36.771
You know, stir things up a bit.

78
00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:43.316

84
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:05.379

Things were going along first-rate.

86
