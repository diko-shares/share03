- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?

359
00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:06.544
We never get to go.

360
00:25:06.544 --> 00:25:08.783
Come along, children. Bedtime.

361
00:25:08.784 --> 00:25:12.943
But we're not a...
(YAWNS) ...bit sleepy.

362
00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:15.940
We want to go for a
walk in the park.

Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.

378

Around the Johnny Horner

379
00:26:21.978 --> 00:26:25.658
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.

380
00:26:25.659 --> 00:26:28.337
One more pinch and they'll
throw the keys away.

381
00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:30.937
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're
getting plenty of boodle.

382
00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:34.137
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.

383
00:26:34.138 --> 00:26:38.736
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.

384

You just leave her to ol' Jasper.

He can handle her
real diplomatic-like.

389
00:27:00.535 --> 00:27:04.371
Yeah, but I still don't like it.

Who do you suppose?

397
00:27:26.614 --> 00:27:28.372
Good evening, ma'am.

398
00:27:28.373 --> 00:27:31.412
We're here to inspect the
wiring and the switches.

399
00:27:31.413 --> 00:27:34.412
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.

400
00:27:34.413 --> 00:27:35.732
Electric company.

401
00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:38.292
But we didn't call
for any inspection.

402
00:27:38.293 --> 00:27:41.492
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act
just been passed in Parliament.

403
00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:45.332
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.

404
00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:47.571
It's a law. And it's for
your own safety, ma'am.

405
00:27:47.572 --> 00:27:50.931
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.

406
00:27:50.932 --> 00:27:54.251
You're not coming in here, not
with the Mister and Missus gone.

407
00:27:54.252 --> 00:27:57.411
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.

408
00:27:57.412 --> 00:28:00.572
We got a job to do. Excuse me!

409
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:03.570
What's the matter with you two?

410
00:28:03.571 --> 00:28:07.010
You got cloth ears? I said
you're not coming in here!

- Oh-ho-ho!

ain't she, Horace? (LAUGHS)

Don't you dare go up there,

Now I mean it. (PANTING)

I'll call the police, I will.

417
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.689
Now be off with you,
you big weasel!

418
00:28:27.689 --> 00:28:29.369
Now you've been gone and done it.

419
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:31.128
You've cut me to the quick, lady.

420
00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:34.727
Why, I wouldn't stay
here if you asked me.

421
00:28:34.728 --> 00:28:36.728
Not even for a cup of tea.

422

Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky
suspicion we're not welcome here.

423

Pack up. We're leaving.

424

Sharp's the word and
quick's the action.

425
00:28:45.288 --> 00:28:47.367
Let me out! Help!

426
00:28:47.368 --> 00:28:49.887
