[ Man Narrating ]
All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city,

2
00:00:52.753 --> 00:00:55.856
which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,

3
00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.560
since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.

4
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.296
I mean it. I have this fear
of enclosed spaces.

5
00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.133
I-I-I... Everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.

6
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.636
You know, I always tell myself
there's gotta be something
better out there.

7
00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:11.105
But maybe I...
maybe I think too much.

8
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:16.244
I-I-I think everything must go
back to the fact that I had
a very anxious childhood.

9
00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:19.513
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

10
00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:25.319
When you're the middle child
in a family of 5 million,
you don't get any attention.

11
00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.121
I mean,
how is it possible ?

12
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:31.559
And-And I've always had
these abandonment issues
which plague me.

13
00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:34.328
My father was-was basically
a drone, like I've said.

14
00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.831
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.

15
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:43.904
And my job,
don't get me started on,
because it really annoys me.

16
00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:47.208
I-I was not cut out
to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

17
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:49.343
I-I-I feel
physically inadequate.

18
00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:55.216
My whole life, I've never been
able to lift more than 10 times
my own body weight.

19
00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:59.587
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know...
[ Shudders ]

20
00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:03.191
is not my idea
of a rewarding career.

21
00:02:03.191 --> 00:02:06.560
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing...

22
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.197
that... that, you know,
I can't get.

23
00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:11.465
I try,
but I don't get it.

24
00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:15.369
I mean, you know, I'm...
What is it ? I'm supposed
to do everything for the colony.

25
00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.071
And-And what about my needs ?
What about me ?

26
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:21.108
I've gotta believe
there's someplace out there
that's better than this.

27
00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:24.545
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

[ Sighs ]

29
00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.849

makes me feel...

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.821
[ Exhales ]
insignificant.
Excellent.

31

You've made
a real breakthrough.
I have ?

32

Yes, Z.
You are insignificant.

Okay. I've got to keep
a positive attitude.

A good attitude, even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

- We'll have to send troops
deep into hostile territory...

- to attack their colony.
- Attack a termite colony,
sir ? That's suicide.

Why would they
attack us ?
They want our land.

They're desperate
for more foraging territory.

116
00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:11.592
Perhaps they think
we've grown soft or weak.

of course not.

131

it might be nice...

if we had a conversation
once before we get married.

absolutely right.

some private time
for me and Princess Bala.

somewhat overbearing at times,

but I know
that he cares about you.

152
00:10:17.685 --> 00:10:20.487
He's just not particularly
good at showing it.

153
00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:24.524
But you should have seen
how persistently he asked
for your hand in marriage.

154
00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:28.528
Why me ?
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

in the dedication ceremony.

is the princess.

Mm.

This stuff tastes like crap.
Really ?
Let me try some.

Hey, it is crap.
Not bad.

827

Somebody needs
to feed that fire.
Dude, I did it last time.

828
00:58:48.926 --> 00:58:51.796
I'm not gonna get it.
It's not my job.

What about the new guy ?
He hasn't contributed yet.

830

And... [ Sighs ]
you know, he just died
in my arms like that.

I... You know,
I don't think he ever

it was like that.

Well, I guess
we just let the general

Let me ask you something.
What made you come
to the bar that night ?

I guess I was looking
for a little trouble.

Well, [ Chuckles ]
trouble's my middle name.

Actually, my middle name
is Marion, but, uh,

to spread that around.
You're pretty strange.

You do know that, don't you ?
Well,
[ Clears Throat ]

You're not like anyone else.

you mention it, there is
a certain strangeness to me.

I mean, it's a, you know,
kind of a bizarre quality.
Some have said "freak."

But it's, uh,
you know, complimentary.

sick about it.

01:19:00.636 --> 01:19:03.539
* Just remember that ram *

1132
01:19:03.539 --> 01:19:08.077
* Oops, there goes
a million-kilowatt dam *
* Oops, there goes *

1133
01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:13.749
* A billion-kilowatt dam *
* Oops, there goes
a zillion-kilowatt dam *

1135
01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:21.557
* Keep your high hopes *

1136
01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:27.496
* Keep those high apple pie

* They'll be bursting soon
They're just bound to go pop *

* Oops, there goes another
problem, ker-plop *
* Oops, there goes *

1140
01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:45.181
* Another problem, ker-plop *
* Oops, there goes another
problem, ker-plop *
