00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:51.150
<i>All my life, I've lived
and worked in the big city,</i>

2
00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.467
<i>which, now that I think of it,
is kind of a problem,</i>

3
00:00:55.553 --> 00:00:58.630
<i>since I always feel
uncomfortable around crowds.</i>

4
00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:01.383
<i>I mean it. I have this fear
of enclosed spaces.</i>

5
00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.146
<i>I- I-I... Everything makes me
feel trapped all the time.</i>

6
00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:07.742
<i>I always tell myself there's gotta be
something better out there.</i>

7
00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:10.025
<i>But maybe I...
Maybe I think too much.</i>

8
00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:14.742
<i>I think everything must go back to the
fact that I had a very anxious childhood.</i>

9
00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:17.866
You know, my mother
never had time for me.

10
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.869
When you're the middle child
in a family of five million,

11
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:23.828
you don't get any attention.

12
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:25.024
I mean, how is it possible?

13
00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:29.428
I've always had these abandonment issues
which plague me.

14
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:31.988
My father was basically a drone,
like I've said.

15
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:34.941
And, you know, the guy flew away
when I was just a larva.

16
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:40.981
And my job, don't get me started on,
because it really annoys me.

17
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.300
I- I was not cut out to be a worker,
I'll tell you right now.

18
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.824
I- I-I feel physically inadequate.

19
00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.064
My whole life,
I've never been able to lift

20
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.060
more than 10 times my own body weight.

21
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.507
And, when you get down to it,
handling dirt is, you know...

22
00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:58.859
is not my idea of a rewarding career.

23
00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.983
It's this whole gung ho,
superorganism thing

24
00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:05.699
that... that, you know, I can't get.

25
00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.186
I try, but I don't get it.

26
00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:08.938
I mean, you know, I'm... What is it?

27
00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.939
I'm supposed to do everything
for the colony.

28
00:02:11.028 --> 00:02:13.658
And-And what about my needs?
What about me?

29
00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.942
I've gotta believe there's someplace
out there that's better than this.

30
00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:20.065
Otherwise, I would just curl up
in a larval position and weep.

31
00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:24.058
The whole system makes me feel...

32
00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:27.421
insignificant.

33
00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:28.864
Excellent.

34
00:02:29.307 --> 00:02:31.218
- You've made a real breakthrough.
- I have?

35
00:02:31.588 --> 00:02:33.977
Yes, Z. You are insignificant.

36
00:02:34.067 --> 00:02:35.224
I- I am?

37
00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:48.460
Ground floor!

38
00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.144
Uh, worker.

39
00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:19.824
Soldier.

40
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:22.375
Ooh.

41
00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.861
- Uh-oh.
- Worker.

42
00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:33.420
Let's try it again.

43
00:03:34.624 --> 00:03:39.097
Firm grip. Swing hard.
Back straight. Concentrate.

44
00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:40.543
Follow through.

45
00:04:06.501 --> 00:04:08.378
Okay. I gotta keep a positive attitude.

46
00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:11.212
A good attitude, even though
I'm utterly insignificant.

47
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.332
I'm-I'm insignificant, um,
but with attitude.

48
00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.815
Ooh, sorry, Z.
I didn't see ya.

49
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:21.211
Great, Azteca.

50
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:23.897
It's working already.
I'm so meaningless, I'm invisible.

51
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:27.891
Now, you're getting it.

52
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:31.731
After all, it's not about you.

53
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.570
It's about us! The team!

54
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.493
It's about... this.

55
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.733
Uh, a giant hole in the ground?

56
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.530
- Okay, people. Are we feeling good?
- Yeah!

57
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.130
- Yeah.
- Great!

58
00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.493
Now, R-1734 through Z-7829,
you guys are on wrecking ball.

59
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.533
- You got it!
- Swell.

60
00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.628
- You got it!
- All right. Swing time.

61
00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.615
Let's get physical!
I love this job! Let's go!

62
00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.296
Now, remember, Azteca, "Be the ball."

63
00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.213
That's the main thing.
Now, remember that.

64
00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:04.536
You know, gotta be one with the ball.

65
00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.136
Would you cut it out already?

66
00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.649
Jeez. I love my work. And you, well...

67
00:05:10.418 --> 00:05:11.488
You think too much.

68
00:05:12.538 --> 00:05:15.888
Come on, Z.
Help us build a bigger, better colony.

69
00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:18.455
And, for cryin' out loud,
try to be happy about it.

70
00:05:18.858 --> 00:05:20.735
Sure, you know. I mean, why-why...

71
00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:23.568
How could I possibly be unhappy
being a piece of construction equipment?

72
00:05:23.658 --> 00:05:26.288
- Okay, workers, remember...
- Here it comes.

73
00:05:26.657 --> 00:05:28.688
...be the ball!

74
00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.447
Let the energy flow through you!

75
00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:37.731
Grin and bear it. This is...
This is for the colony.

76
00:05:40.377 --> 00:05:41.774
Ow. This is...

77
00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:43.810
This is just a lawsuit waiting to happen.

78
00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:46.930
Hang on. Here we go. Higher! Faster!

79
00:05:47.016 --> 00:05:49.929
Did I happen to mention that
heights make me nauseous?

80
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:50.846
No.

81
00:05:50.936 --> 00:05:51.895
This is a ball!

82
00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:55.485
Hey!

83
00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:06.085
- Oh, Z.
- Yes. Yes. I understand.

84
00:06:06.175 --> 00:06:07.245
I dropped the ball.

85
00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:12.884
Workers. They're weak.

86
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:16.329
They lack discipline.
They lack commitment.

87
00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:19.932
General, I know there's been
a glitch or two.

88
00:06:20.374 --> 00:06:23.451
But everybody is working
full tilt as it is, and...

89
00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:27.364
You can't help it, it's your nature.

90
00:06:27.893 --> 00:06:29.650
But in spite of your limitations,

91
00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:32.364
you are going to finish this tunnel
on schedule.

92
00:06:32.894 --> 00:06:34.171
Come hell or high water.

93
00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:35.890
From now on, anyone who falls behind

94
00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:38.243
is going to have to explain themselves
to Colonel Cutter.

95
00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:42.644
And let me assure you, the Colonel is not
as understanding as I am.

96
00:06:42.933 --> 00:06:43.892
Dismissed.

97
00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:49.883
Four more days, Cutter. Four more days.

98
00:06:50.412 --> 00:06:53.883
And we can bid final farewell
to their kind of incompetence.

99
00:06:53.972 --> 00:06:54.931
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.246
A fresh start.

101
00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.889
- Imagine it!
- A strong colony, sir.

102
00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:02.286
A colony we can be proud of.

103
00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:03.725
Yes, but we're not there yet.

104
00:07:04.852 --> 00:07:09.325
Cutter, we just got word that
a termite army has mobilized against us.

105
00:07:09.412 --> 00:07:10.371
Against us?

106
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:14.729
We'll have to send troops deep into
hostile territory to attack their colony.

107
00:07:14.931 --> 00:07:18.280
Attack a termite colony, sir?
That's suicide.

108
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:20.848
Exactly. Do you have the list I asked for?

109
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.404
Yes, General.

110
00:07:23.611 --> 00:07:26.481
These are the units loyal to the queen.

111
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:29.130
Hm.

112
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.884
Then they're the ones we'll be sending.

113
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.728
It's a shame.
There are some fine officers here.

114
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.204
Don't we need the queen's approval
to declare war?

115
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.720
Our very next stop, Cutter.

116
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.004
General, we've been at peace
with that colony for years.

117
00:07:45.649 --> 00:07:48.126
- Why would they attack us?
- They want our land.

118
00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:50.642
They're desperate
for more foraging territory.

119
00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:53.283
Perhaps they think
we've grown soft or weak.

120
00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:56.999
Why don't we dispatch an ambassador,
negotiate a new treaty?

121
00:07:58.049 --> 00:08:00.122
Certainly, we don't need to send soldiers.

122
00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:01.398
Believe me.

123
00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:04.206
Every ant in this colony
is so precious to me.

124
00:08:06.248 --> 00:08:09.565
That's why we must strike now,
while we have the element of surprise.

125
00:08:09.928 --> 00:08:12.765
If the termite shock troops
enter our colony, well...

126
00:08:12.848 --> 00:08:16.645
Yes, General,
I know what they can do to us.

127
00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:19.804
Very well.

128
00:08:19.888 --> 00:08:21.437
You've made a wise decision.

129
00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:24.885
In fact, you've insured
the future of this colony.

130
00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:28.566
Hello, General.

131
00:08:30.527 --> 00:08:33.561
Princess Bala. What a nice surprise.

132
00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.436
You look lovelier each time I see you.

133
00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:37.006
Thanks.

134
00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:40.045
I hope you're not just here on business.

135
00:08:40.126 --> 00:08:42.996
Oh, of course...
Of course not.

136
00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:48.400
Because, um, it might be nice
if we had a conversation

137
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.315
once before we get married.

138
00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:51.715
You're absolutely right.

139
00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:54.556
Cutter, schedule some private time
for me and Princess Bala.

140
00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:58.875
Uh, in fact, sir, there is time right now
for a personal moment.

141
00:08:58.965 --> 00:09:01.159
We're a few seconds ahead of schedule.

142
00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:03.242
Excellent. Princess.

143
00:09:03.325 --> 00:09:07.799
Well, a few seconds isn't much, but

144
00:09:08.245 --> 00:09:10.198
I guess if it's quality time...

145
00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:13.958
So, how was your day?

146
00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:16.798
- Anything interesting happen?
- We declared war.

147
00:09:17.604 --> 00:09:18.762
Declared war?

148
00:09:20.084 --> 00:09:22.114
Boy, talk about a rough day.

149
00:09:22.204 --> 00:09:26.154
Sir, I hate to interrupt,
but time stands still for no ant.

150
00:09:26.443 --> 00:09:27.402
Princess.

151
00:09:33.163 --> 00:09:37.561
Mom, could you remind me,
why am I marrying this guy?

152
00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:40.361
Bala, do we have to argue
about this again?

153
00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:44.433
We don't seem to have
anything in common. The guy's a stiff.

154
00:09:44.523 --> 00:09:47.677
Yes, darling. I know the General
may be a little gruff,

155
00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:50.480
and somewhat overbearing at times,

156
00:09:50.562 --> 00:09:53.432
but I know that he cares about you.

157
00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:56.075
He's just not particularly good
at showing it.

158
00:09:56.642 --> 00:10:00.592
But you should have seen how persistently
he asked for your hand in marriage.

159
00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:01.872
But why me?

160
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:04.351
Because you're the one
who has to continue my work.

161
00:10:04.802 --> 00:10:06.232
It's your place, dear.

162
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:11.031
- What if I don't like my place?
- Everyone has their place, Bala:

163
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.998
you, the soldiers, the workers.

164
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:17.031
Now, it's not all that bad
being princess, is it?

165
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.754
Would you prefer to be
carting around dirt all day?

166
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:21.794
Oh, Mother, don't be so dramatic.

167
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.230
At least, they seem to have some fun
every now and then.

168
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.710
- Two aphid beers.
- Why'd I have to be born a worker?

169
00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:38.873
You soldiers get all the glory,
plus you get to go out in the world.

170
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.153
You meet interesting insects,
you get to kill them.

171
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.313
Yeah.

172
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:44.756
But you get to spend all day with those...

173
00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:47.353
beautiful worker girls.

174
00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:51.229
Weaver, they're career girls.
They're obsessed with digging.

175
00:10:52.998 --> 00:10:55.749
I really don't think I'm ever gonna meet
the right girl for me.

176
00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:58.512
Who said a girl for you?
I was talking about a girl for me.

177
00:10:58.598 --> 00:11:01.195
Don't you want your aphid beer?

178
00:11:01.638 --> 00:11:03.055
Call me crazy, but...

179
00:11:03.078 --> 00:11:05.992
I have a thing about drinking
from the anus of another creature. Okay?

180
00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:07.236
Suit yourself.

181
00:11:09.638 --> 00:11:11.908
Ah! Me, I'm cuttin' loose.

182
00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:13.954
We got royal inspection comin' up.

183
00:11:14.038 --> 00:11:16.711
Inspection, meaning you're gonna
stand around like an idiot

184
00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:18.751
while a bunch of blue bloods smirk at you.

185
00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:20.814
I don't know how you put up with it,
Weaver.

186
00:11:20.837 --> 00:11:23.587
Z, I've known you for a long time. Right?

187
00:11:23.676 --> 00:11:25.946
Definitely. You were born
two seconds after me.

188
00:11:26.037 --> 00:11:28.874
Yeah. And ever since we were little,
I've been listenin' to you complain.

189
00:11:28.957 --> 00:11:30.867
What are you bitching about?

190
00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:33.630
In case you haven't noticed,
we ants are running the show.

191
00:11:33.716 --> 00:11:35.146
We're the lords of the Earth.

192
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:37.790
Hey. Don't talk to me about earth, okay?

193
00:11:37.876 --> 00:11:39.874
'Cause I just spent all day
hauling it around.

194
00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:44.074
There's just gotta be a better place.

195
00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:47.754
There is. I've been there.

196
00:11:48.596 --> 00:11:50.626
I'm sor... I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

197
00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:52.549
There is a better place.

198
00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:55.388
Insectopia.

199
00:11:55.475 --> 00:11:59.470
Oh, really. Lunatic at 3:00.

200
00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:03.548
You can't understand until you go there
and see it for yourself.

201
00:12:04.554 --> 00:12:06.344
You can be your own ant there.

202
00:12:06.675 --> 00:12:08.825
The streets are paved with food.

203
00:12:09.114 --> 00:12:11.144
Nobody tellin' you what to do.

204
00:12:11.474 --> 00:12:14.105
No wars. No colony.

205
00:12:15.674 --> 00:12:19.144
- I shoulda never left.
- Oh, yeah. Fascinating.

206
00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:22.747
We were on a long-range recon.
I got cut off from my unit.

207
00:12:22.994 --> 00:12:26.343
Nothing like a little post-traumatic
stress disorder to make your day complete.

208
00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.151
- Then I saw it! Insectopia!
- Hey!

209
00:12:29.553 --> 00:12:31.070
You head towards the monolith.

210
00:12:31.153 --> 00:12:34.307
Ten clicks past the great canyons
to the land of red and white!

211
00:12:34.393 --> 00:12:37.231
Hey, gramps.
You've had enough for one night.

212
00:12:37.633 --> 00:12:39.346
Come on. Before you get in trouble.

213
00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.865
Head for the monolith! Listen to me!

214
00:12:41.953 --> 00:12:42.912
The monolith!

215
00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:45.942
That guy's got a screw loose.

216
00:12:46.032 --> 00:12:48.509
- Cross the lake!
- Insectopia.

217
00:12:48.912 --> 00:12:50.582
Wouldn't it be great if it were that easy?

218
00:12:50.672 --> 00:12:54.709
- Yeah. Dream on, Z.
- Cross the lake!

219
00:12:55.072 --> 00:12:56.861
Look for the land of red and white!

220
00:12:58.112 --> 00:13:02.902
Wow! This is so... gritty.

221
00:13:03.232 --> 00:13:06.266
Ten minutes and we're out of here.
Right? This place is off-limits.

222
00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:08.905
Just blame it on me.
Say it was all my idea.

223
00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:10.464
It is all your idea.

224
00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:13.705
Besides, no one's gonna recognize us.

225
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.587
Come on, girls. What do you say?

226
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.380
Let's take a walk on the wild side.

227
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:23.341
<i>Okay, everybody.
6:15. Time to dance.</i>

228
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.063
- Time to cut a rug, Z.
- Oh, no. That's okay.

229
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.107
I'm gonna leave the rug
just the way it is, Weaver.

230
00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:43.103
Step back, ladies.

231
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:46.467
I'm gonna ask one of these workers
to dance with me.

232
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:47.788
Oh.

233
00:13:49.908 --> 00:13:52.026
What a bunch of losers.

234
00:13:52.468 --> 00:13:55.622
Mindless zombies capitulating
to an oppressive system.

235
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:57.542
Hi. Wanna dance?

236
00:13:58.468 --> 00:13:59.626
Absolutely.

237
00:14:00.948 --> 00:14:01.907
Follow me.

238
00:14:03.908 --> 00:14:06.265
So, how come I haven't seen you
around here before?

239
00:14:06.747 --> 00:14:08.264
Oh, I don't get out much.

240
00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:10.825
I, uh, I work over at the palace.

241
00:14:10.907 --> 00:14:14.105
Oh, the palace, huh?
I bet those royals really live it up.

242
00:14:14.467 --> 00:14:17.381
Course they're all a little,
you know, from inbreeding.

243
00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:18.426
What?

244
00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:22.906
Yowch!

245
00:14:24.827 --> 00:14:26.257
Ya-ya-yowch!

246
00:14:27.427 --> 00:14:28.386
Yowch.

247
00:14:32.106 --> 00:14:35.140
- Yowch.
- What on earth are you doing?

248
00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:39.056
Well, actually, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of making it up.

249
00:14:39.706 --> 00:14:40.665
Really?

250
00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:42.743
Why does everybody have to dance
the same way?

251
00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:45.860
You know, that's completely boring.
It's... It's monotonous.

252
00:14:45.946 --> 00:14:47.899
It's no fun.

253
00:15:16.664 --> 00:15:18.694
Hey. Watch your step, worker.

254
00:15:18.783 --> 00:15:21.380
You watch yours, buddy,
or you'll be in big trouble.

255
00:15:21.464 --> 00:15:24.454
Th-Th-That's okay.
I'll... I'm gonna let him off this time.

256
00:15:25.304 --> 00:15:27.618
What? Are you crazy?
This guy's built like a pebble.

257
00:15:27.703 --> 00:15:29.373
Aren't you even gonna defend yourself?

258
00:15:29.463 --> 00:15:31.057
Hey, buddy. Get back in place.

259
00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:36.136
- Me? Uh... Uh...
- What if he doesn't want to?

260
00:15:37.463 --> 00:15:40.060
Yeah.
What if I don't like my place?

261
00:15:40.142 --> 00:15:42.379
- What's he talkin' about?
- We got us a troublemaker.

262
00:15:42.462 --> 00:15:43.455
Buckle up, Spanky.

263
00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:47.100
This one goes out
to all the lazy workers.

264
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:51.731
You ought to watch that
aggressive behavior, buddy.

265
00:15:51.821 --> 00:15:53.852
He's just a worker.

266
00:15:56.381 --> 00:15:58.069
- Take it outside!
- Come on!

267
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.334
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
The guards are coming.

268
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.254
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait! Wait!

269
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.817
Princess? You're a princess?

270
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:26.930
Uh, I gotta go.

271
00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.813
- When can I see you again?
- Let me think.

272
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.179
Never.

273
00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:34.133
- Bye.
- No. Wait!

274
00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:42.729

275
00:16:42.818 --> 00:16:45.449

280
00:17:09.658 --> 00:17:10.617
Yowch.

281
00:17:26.576 --> 00:17:29.686
- Can I get you another one, pal?
- No, thanks.

282
00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:33.410
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Yeah. I don't blame you.

283
00:17:33.496 --> 00:17:36.933
It's always slow in here the night
before one of those royal reviews.

284
00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:39.929
I guess the soldiers need their shut-eye
before they meet the queen.

285
00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:42.133
- I don't blame ya.
- That's it!

286
00:17:42.976 --> 00:17:44.613
You know, I was once...

287
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:46.294
See ya.

288
00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:54.564
Psst. Weaver.

289
00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:58.648
I figured it out! Weaver. Weaver!

290
00:17:58.735 --> 00:17:59.771
What? What?

291
00:17:59.855 --> 00:18:01.581
I got a great idea.

292
00:18:01.934 --> 00:18:05.764
You gotta switch places with me. Let me go
to the inspection instead of you.

293
00:18:06.014 --> 00:18:09.605
- What time is it?
- Weaver. The royal family will be there.

294
00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:11.530
This is the only way I can see her.

295
00:18:12.213 --> 00:18:14.690
- See who?
- Princess Bala.

296
00:18:15.013 --> 00:18:16.084
Are you nuts?

297
00:18:16.493 --> 00:18:18.731
You want me to switch places with you?

298
00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.526
Do you know how much trouble
you can get into

299
00:18:21.613 --> 00:18:23.927
for even talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier?

300
00:18:24.253 --> 00:18:25.890
You can get in trouble just for listenin'

301
00:18:25.973 --> 00:18:28.407
to someone talkin' about
impersonatin' a soldier.

302
00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:30.922
You have to help me.

303
00:18:31.012 --> 00:18:34.766
If I can't see her again,
my life is just not worth living.

304
00:18:35.132 --> 00:18:38.090
Pl-Pl-Please, Weaver. Please.

305
00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:41.529
Switch jobs with me just for a day.

306
00:18:42.132 --> 00:18:44.011
Th-Think of all the things
that I've done for you.

307
00:18:44.692 --> 00:18:46.646
Mm-hmm. I can't think of any.

308
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:50.642
Okay. So, think of all the things
that I'm gonna do for you.

309
00:18:53.371 --> 00:18:54.648
Would I meet some worker girls?

310
00:18:54.731 --> 00:18:58.048
Are you kidding?
They always go after the new guy.

311
00:18:58.131 --> 00:18:59.725
It's like a sport for them!

312
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:02.480
And-And believe me,
they will definitely go for

313
00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:04.327
an adorable little insect like you.

314
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.370
Mm-hmm.

315
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:08.887
Weaver, I... I have to see her again.

316
00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:13.124
Z, what kind of chance
do you have with a princess?

317
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.447
I mean, she probably
won't even remember you.

318
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.319
I... I know it sounds nuts.

319
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.047
But I have to try.

320
00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:26.319
Oh, boy.

321
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.603
Princess, fancy meeting you here.

322
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:32.407
What do you say we lose this crowd?

323
00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:37.486
Oh, me? You know, I... I wear many hats.

324
00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:39.959
I guess you'd have to call me
a Renaissance ant.

325
00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:41.519
Eyes right!

326
00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:49.126
- Beautiful! Just beautiful!
- Mm.

327
00:19:50.168 --> 00:19:52.798
The precision. The order.

328
00:19:53.288 --> 00:19:56.725
Princess Bala! Princess Bala!
Hey. It's me.

329
00:19:56.808 --> 00:19:58.478
Remember Z from the bar?

330
00:19:58.568 --> 00:20:01.842
Princess Bala! Princess Bala! Princess...

331
00:20:01.927 --> 00:20:04.044
Bala, you must encourage the troops.

332
00:20:04.687 --> 00:20:05.646
Wave.

333
00:20:06.527 --> 00:20:10.402
Oh. She sees me!
Excuse me, guys. I-I... I'm sorry.

334
00:20:10.487 --> 00:20:12.637
I just got a better offer.
Could you excu...

335
00:20:12.727 --> 00:20:14.200
Company halt!

336
00:20:18.047 --> 00:20:19.160
Princess!

337
00:20:20.326 --> 00:20:22.880
- Princess Bala!
- Quiet there! Get back in rank.

338
00:20:23.926 --> 00:20:27.800
- You new, kid?
- Oh, yes, but I'm gettin' out soon.

339
00:20:27.886 --> 00:20:29.839
I- I got a trial membership.

340
00:20:29.926 --> 00:20:33.275
Trial membership.
That's a good one!

341
00:20:33.846 --> 00:20:35.876
- Name's Barbatus.
- Z.

342
00:20:35.965 --> 00:20:37.876
- Right face!
- Psst!

343
00:20:45.485 --> 00:20:50.080
Sacrifice. To some, it is just a word.

344
00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:52.874
To others, it is a code!

345
00:20:52.964 --> 00:20:55.561
Jeez. I'm bad at word games.

346
00:20:55.645 --> 00:20:58.635
A soldier knows that the life
of an individual ant doesn't matter.

347
00:20:59.365 --> 00:21:00.838
What matters is the colony.

348
00:21:01.364 --> 00:21:04.801
He's willing to live for the colony,
to fight for the colony,

349
00:21:05.044 --> 00:21:06.321
to die for the colony.

350
00:21:06.404 --> 00:21:09.797
- This guy's crazy.
- I hear ya.

351
00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:14.162
At 0800 hours, we received word
that the termite enemy has mobilized.

352
00:21:14.683 --> 00:21:17.881
We have no choice but to launch
a preemptive strike.

353
00:21:18.483 --> 00:21:20.316
You are the queen's finest.

354
00:21:20.643 --> 00:21:22.640
I know you will all do your duty.

355
00:21:23.683 --> 00:21:26.072
I am proud to send you into battle.

356
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:28.640
Into... I'm sor... I'm sorry, into battle?

357
00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:32.400
- Dismissed.
- Left face. Forward march.

358
00:21:33.842 --> 00:21:35.752
You know, I think there's been
a terrible mistake.

359
00:21:35.842 --> 00:21:38.713
You know, the truth is I just...
I just came for the speech.

360
00:21:38.802 --> 00:21:41.279
Don't worry, kid. I'll watch out for ya.

361
00:21:48.121 --> 00:21:49.080
Sound off!

362
00:21:49.122 --> 00:21:50.115
- One!
- Two!

363
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:51.272
Sound off!

364
00:21:51.361 --> 00:21:52.397
- Three!
- Huh?

365
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:53.355
Sound off!

366
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:54.477
- Five!
- Six!

367
00:21:54.561 --> 00:21:55.554
- Seven!
- Eight!

368
00:21:55.641 --> 00:21:56.600
- Nine!
- Ten!

369
00:21:56.681 --> 00:21:57.795
- Eleven!
- Twelve!

370
00:21:57.881 --> 00:21:58.918
- Thirteen!
- Fourteen!

371
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.191
<i>♪ We ants go marching one by one
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

372
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.914
<i>♪ We slaughter termites just for fun
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

373
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.073
So, these termites, they're-they're...

374
00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:13.674
These guys are not going to put up much of
a fight? We're talkin' pushovers, right?

375
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.553
Not really, kid.
They're five times our size.

376
00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.634
And they shoot acid from their foreheads.

377
00:22:19.319 --> 00:22:21.273
Hey! Keep it movin', shorty!

378
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.070
<i>♪ We ants go marching two by two
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

379
00:22:25.159 --> 00:22:29.350
<i>♪ We'll all be dead before we're through
Hurrah, hurrah ♪</i>

380
00:22:29.439 --> 00:22:32.713
Say, what exactly does our platoon do?

381
00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:36.869
I mean, will we be serving beverages
or processing paperwork?

382
00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:40.396
Our platoon has the best assignment
of all! We're the first into battle.

383
00:22:40.478 --> 00:22:44.276
<i>♪ We ants go marching three by three
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

384
00:22:44.358 --> 00:22:46.551
<i>♪ Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

385
00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:50.788
<i>♪ We're off to face our destiny
Hurrah, hurrah! ♪</i>

386
00:22:50.877 --> 00:22:53.671
Hey. Wait a minute. Let's not get...
We're being too hasty here.

387
00:22:53.757 --> 00:22:56.747
These... These guys sound like bruisers.

388
00:22:56.838 --> 00:22:58.671
Just how were you figuring
on beating them?

389
00:22:58.757 --> 00:23:00.591
Superior numbers, kid!

390
00:23:00.957 --> 00:23:03.434
Overwhelm their defenses
and kill their queen!

391
00:23:04.637 --> 00:23:07.267
Hey, fellas. You're being
a little extreme, I feel.

392
00:23:07.357 --> 00:23:10.150
Why don't we try and influence
their political process

393
00:23:10.236 --> 00:23:11.906
with campaign contributions?

394
00:23:11.996 --> 00:23:15.433
I like you, kid!
You got a sense of humor.

395
00:23:15.517 --> 00:23:19.270
- Forward!
- Come on. Let's kick some termite butt!

396
00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:21.267
Over the top!

397
00:23:24.796 --> 00:23:27.666
Yeeow!

398
00:23:33.196 --> 00:23:34.625
Yee-haw!

399
00:23:51.834 --> 00:23:53.865
- Where is everyone?
- Something's not right.

400
00:23:55.954 --> 00:23:57.307
Don't be scared, kid.

401
00:24:02.794 --> 00:24:03.951
They're here!

402
00:24:05.594 --> 00:24:08.988
Attack!

403
00:24:31.352 --> 00:24:32.311
Come on.

404
00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:50.385
Barbatus, you saved my life.

405
00:24:50.471 --> 00:24:52.304
Ah, don't get all sappy about it.

406
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:02.500
Hey, guys. Look out behind you!

407
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.107
Hey. Hey, guys?

408
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:14.866
Can somebody help me here?
Can anybody... Hey.

409
00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:29.428
Yeah.

410
00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:33.906
Okay, mama.

411
00:25:34.668 --> 00:25:35.627
Yeah!

412
00:25:37.428 --> 00:25:39.938
Oh, yeah. Big guy comin' through.

413
00:25:42.788 --> 00:25:43.825
Love it.

414
00:25:49.427 --> 00:25:52.178
Hey. Hey. Hey. Take it easy, muscles.

415
00:25:53.427 --> 00:25:55.337
You're makin' the rest of us look bad.

416
00:25:56.948 --> 00:25:58.225
What happened to Z?

417
00:25:59.187 --> 00:26:02.221
He's takin' a personal day,
so I'm fillin' in.

418
00:26:02.707 --> 00:26:05.021
You fill in any more, and you'll explode.

419
00:26:10.107 --> 00:26:11.537
Eh, you got a problem?

420
00:26:11.626 --> 00:26:14.376
No, um...

421
00:26:14.466 --> 00:26:15.962
Nobody told me digging was so much fun.

422
00:26:15.986 --> 00:26:19.140
You know, you pick the dirt up.
You move it.

423
00:26:19.226 --> 00:26:23.383
You pick it up again.
You move it again. Lots of reps.

424
00:26:23.465 --> 00:26:25.616
You exercise the arms and the thorax.

425
00:26:25.706 --> 00:26:27.823
Yes, I... I see what you mean.

426
00:26:27.906 --> 00:26:30.536
- Mm. Yeah. That is fascinating.
- Sorry, sir.

427
00:26:30.705 --> 00:26:32.942
I was just havin' a little chat
with my friend, sir.

428
00:26:33.305 --> 00:26:36.622
You know, I just had a little chat
with General Mandible.

429
00:26:37.424 --> 00:26:41.015
Anybody who doesn't meet his quota
is going to be downsized.

430
00:26:41.105 --> 00:26:42.415
Come on. Cut him a break.

431
00:26:43.985 --> 00:26:44.944
He's new.

432
00:26:45.465 --> 00:26:46.424
Hey.

433
00:26:46.824 --> 00:26:49.979
What do you say we help
your attitude a little bit

434
00:26:50.064 --> 00:26:53.534
by taking away your rations
for the day?

435
00:26:54.784 --> 00:26:55.743
Thanks for your time.

436
00:26:57.904 --> 00:26:59.497
I don't know what came over me.

437
00:26:59.584 --> 00:27:00.817
Talking back like that.

438
00:27:02.064 --> 00:27:03.023
I must be losin' it.

439
00:27:04.063 --> 00:27:05.416
Sorry I got you in trouble.

440
00:27:05.504 --> 00:27:09.017
But, listen, you can...
share my rations. Whoa.

441
00:27:09.103 --> 00:27:10.062
If you want.

442
00:27:10.823 --> 00:27:14.020
Are you askin' me out to dinner?

443
00:27:14.103 --> 00:27:17.453
Oh, no. I... Well...

444
00:27:18.062 --> 00:27:20.693
If you don't have anything else planned.

445
00:27:20.782 --> 00:27:23.019
I'll check my calendar.

446
00:27:23.862 --> 00:27:24.821
You know...

447
00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:28.056
I'm kinda glad Z's takin' a breather.

448
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.099
Kid!

449
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.170
Kid, over here.

450
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.738
Barbatus.

451
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.730
Be honest, kid. Am I hurt bad?

452
00:28:10.139 --> 00:28:14.253
N- No. N-Not at all. You're...
Actually, you're lookin' terrific.

453
00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.537
You got, you know,
swell color in your cheeks.

454
00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:21.089
No. I can see it in your eyes.

455
00:28:22.259 --> 00:28:23.329
I'm a goner.

456
00:28:25.058 --> 00:28:26.017
Help me up, Z.

457
00:28:28.778 --> 00:28:32.128
Oh! I can't feel my legs.

458
00:28:32.218 --> 00:28:36.736
You gotta hang in there, buddy.
I know you're gonna make it.

459
00:28:36.818 --> 00:28:39.536
Just take... take deep breaths.

460
00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:42.368
Because I'm gonna try and find your body.

461
00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:46.256
It's bound to be out there somewhere...

462
00:28:53.578 --> 00:28:55.967
Barbatus, hang on.

463
00:28:58.057 --> 00:29:01.647
- Barbatus...
- Don't make my mistake, kid.

464
00:29:03.137 --> 00:29:04.926
Don't follow orders your whole life.

465
00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:08.050
Think for yourself.

466
00:29:13.176 --> 00:29:14.693
Barbatus.

467
00:29:28.975 --> 00:29:30.010
<i>We're on schedule.</i>

468
00:29:30.055 --> 00:29:32.773
Work is completed on "A" section, sir.

469
00:29:33.094 --> 00:29:34.851
We're clearing a path
through "D" section now.

470
00:29:34.935 --> 00:29:38.132
We need to push harder, Cutter.
I want double shifts around-the-clock.

471
00:29:38.215 --> 00:29:41.008
- We can't afford to let up. Is that clear?
- Crystal, sir.

472
00:29:41.094 --> 00:29:43.332
Good. What about section...

473
00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:44.572
Excuse me, sir.

474
00:29:45.094 --> 00:29:46.447
This had better be important.

475
00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:48.291
Well, it's about the termite battle, sir.

476
00:29:48.694 --> 00:29:53.409
The enemy was destroyed, but I'm afraid
it was a disaster for our troops, as well.

477
00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:56.527
Well, that's terrible. Terrible!

478
00:29:56.934 --> 00:30:00.208
There is a bit of good news, sir.
One soldier did make it back.

479
00:30:00.293 --> 00:30:01.963
- No kidding?
- What did you say?

480
00:30:02.053 --> 00:30:03.723
Word is spreading through the colony, sir.

481
00:30:03.813 --> 00:30:06.127
The queen requested a meeting
with the war hero.

482
00:30:06.453 --> 00:30:09.563
Damn! Good.
Damn good.

483
00:30:09.653 --> 00:30:10.843
Uh, I'll handle this.

484
00:30:14.972 --> 00:30:17.003
Congratulations, soldier.

485
00:30:18.652 --> 00:30:21.402
Well, you're a little short
for a war hero, aren't you?

486
00:30:21.692 --> 00:30:22.882
A war hero?

487
00:30:23.292 --> 00:30:27.406
Sir. I don't actually think
that I'm a hero.

488
00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:29.281
Good. I don't like heroes.

489
00:30:29.372 --> 00:30:31.481
But, sir. You don't understand.

490
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:41.164
I... I didn't do anything.

491
00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:45.125
I mean, it was all horrible.
It was just a massacre.

492
00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.403
A massacre upon a massacre.

493
00:30:47.491 --> 00:30:49.881
That's good, soldier. Now, wave.

494
00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.968
There was nothing you could do, Weaver.

495
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.404
You didn't know they were going to war.

496
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:03.559
I just feel horrible.

497
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.528
Poor Z. I should have never let him go.

498
00:31:08.129 --> 00:31:10.606
Wait a minute. That's no soldier.

499
00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:11.967
That's Z!

500
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:13.288
Z?

501
00:31:13.689 --> 00:31:16.286
The little guy made it!

502
00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:21.279
Let's go, soldier.

503
00:31:30.568 --> 00:31:34.005
As I was saying, son,
you are an ant after my own heart.

504
00:31:34.248 --> 00:31:37.206
An ant that looks Death
in the face and laughs.

505
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:40.044
Well, actually, the truth is,

506
00:31:40.128 --> 00:31:42.442
I generally just make
belittling comments

507
00:31:42.528 --> 00:31:44.405
and snicker behind Death's back.

508
00:31:46.208 --> 00:31:47.321
General Mandible!

509
00:31:50.007 --> 00:31:51.884
Keep your comments to yourself.

510
00:31:52.207 --> 00:31:53.364
Let me do the talking.

511
00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:03.956
May I present Her Majesty, the Queen.

512
00:32:04.727 --> 00:32:06.244
Charmed. Charmed.

513
00:32:06.326 --> 00:32:08.203
And the Royal Princess Bala.

514
00:32:10.526 --> 00:32:11.835
Welcome home, soldier.

515
00:32:12.526 --> 00:32:16.040
We cannot begin to express our gratitude
for your heroic efforts.

516
00:32:16.126 --> 00:32:18.996
The private has asked me to convey
his most humble appreciation.

517
00:32:19.085 --> 00:32:22.043
Please. Please. It was nothing really.

518
00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:24.679
Just your average run-of-the-mill valor

519
00:32:24.765 --> 00:32:27.243
and extraordinary courageousness,
you know.

520
00:32:27.325 --> 00:32:30.435
In the heat of battle,
there's very little time to think.

521
00:32:30.525 --> 00:32:33.799
One must attack! Attack! Attack!

522
00:32:33.884 --> 00:32:36.199
Well, indeed.

523
00:32:36.285 --> 00:32:39.722
As you can see, Your Highness,
the battlefield is fresh in his mind.

524
00:32:39.804 --> 00:32:41.594
So, begging your pardon,

525
00:32:41.684 --> 00:32:44.522
but this is the perfect time
to debrief the private.

526
00:32:44.604 --> 00:32:47.878
Oh, please, General.
Not on our first date.

527
00:32:48.243 --> 00:32:50.197
Not on our first date.

528
00:32:50.524 --> 00:32:52.521
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

529
00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.714
Well, maybe. And then again, maybe not.

530
00:32:55.803 --> 00:32:57.560
And then... then again.

531
00:32:58.523 --> 00:32:59.320
Yowch.

532
00:32:59.403 --> 00:33:01.913
That's it! You're the guy from the bar.

533
00:33:02.003 --> 00:33:04.677
- Don't! Shh!
- "Bar"? What bar?

534
00:33:04.763 --> 00:33:07.873
I danced with this guy
at the bar the other night.

535
00:33:08.443 --> 00:33:09.960
He was just a worker then.

536
00:33:10.563 --> 00:33:13.356
- What were you doing at a bar?
- Precisely what I want to know.

537
00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:15.396
No. This isn't about me.

538
00:33:15.482 --> 00:33:18.036
I mean, look at this worker.
Look what he's done.

539
00:33:18.122 --> 00:33:21.396
I think you're thinkin' of someone else.
After all, I am a solider.

540
00:33:21.722 --> 00:33:24.319
Exactly. You were a worker.

541
00:33:24.762 --> 00:33:26.431
But now, you're a war hero.

542
00:33:27.682 --> 00:33:31.392
- He's a worker?
- A worker danced with my fiancée?

543
00:33:31.641 --> 00:33:34.958
F- Fiancée? W-W-Wait a minute.

544
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.671
This is not how it looks.
I can explain this.

545
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:40.270
Hey. She was the one
making all the moves.

546
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.319
Arrest him.

547
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.519
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.
Take it easy. Can't we discuss this?

548
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.110
What are you doing? Let go of my daughter.

549
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.277
He's taking her hostage!

550
00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.831
No. No. I'm not. I mean, yes, I am.

551
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.477
One more step and, uh,
the princess gets it.

552
00:33:55.559 --> 00:33:58.156
Let go of me!

553
00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.199
Ow!

554
00:33:59.679 --> 00:34:01.556
Don't make me hurt her. Ow!

555
00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.028
Uh.

556
00:34:18.119 --> 00:34:20.628
What are you doing, you creep?

557
00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:23.036
Are you out of your puny little mind?

558
00:34:23.118 --> 00:34:26.108
There they are! Down there!
Let's go. Move. Move. Move.

559
00:34:26.198 --> 00:34:27.792
Oh, good.

560
00:34:28.558 --> 00:34:31.668
Here they come to rescue me and kill you.

561
00:34:31.757 --> 00:34:32.511
Kill?

562
00:34:32.597 --> 00:34:34.595
- Hey, you guys!
- Stop it. Stop it.

563
00:34:34.677 --> 00:34:37.035
- What are you tryin' to do?
- Get off me, you little twerp!

564
00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:38.175
- What do you want to do?
- Ow!

565
00:34:38.198 --> 00:34:39.732
- Throw away everything we've got?
- Hey!

566
00:34:40.757 --> 00:34:42.591
What're you waiting for?

567
00:34:42.677 --> 00:34:44.947
Hello? Guys!

568
00:34:51.637 --> 00:34:53.351
- Huh?
- What is it?

569
00:34:58.276 --> 00:34:59.793
It's beautiful.

570
00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.873
Ridgeway, get out of there!

571
00:35:27.075 --> 00:35:28.068
- Oof!
- Uh!

572
00:35:41.474 --> 00:35:44.508
- Oh. Don't worry. I'm okay.
- You?

573
00:35:44.593 --> 00:35:46.983
You? You're okay?

574
00:35:47.513 --> 00:35:48.943
Hey. Who cares about you?

575
00:35:49.033 --> 00:35:51.151
- I almost died here.
- Will you please calm down?

576
00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:53.710
You're not going to let
a little near-death experience

577
00:35:53.793 --> 00:35:54.906
ruin your mood, are you?

578
00:35:54.994 --> 00:35:58.988
Hey. This is not a mood, okay?
You're not listening to me.

579
00:36:00.713 --> 00:36:01.870
Where am I?

580
00:36:05.553 --> 00:36:06.546
Look, what's-your-name.

581
00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:10.430
Just climb up that tree
and find out where I am.

582
00:36:10.512 --> 00:36:13.066
Look, the-the trick is not to panic.

583
00:36:13.152 --> 00:36:15.782
You know, h-h-he who panics is lost.

584
00:36:16.232 --> 00:36:18.502
What am I saying? We are lost.

585
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:27.582
Ow!

586
00:36:29.871 --> 00:36:32.021
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.

587
00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:33.788
Who's the bigger idiot,

588
00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:36.468
the idiot or the idiot
who gets kidnapped by the idiot?

589
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.743
What'd you do,
talk those termites to death?

590
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.344
I can't believe you tried to
pass yourself off as a soldier.

591
00:36:43.391 --> 00:36:44.668
Why are you stalking me?

592
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.340
Don't you realize I'm out of your league?

593
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.220
You're the one
who was cruising the worker bar

594
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.423
looking for a little action.

595
00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.779
And you just happened to find it...

596
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.620
the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker.

597
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.067
Please. I was slumming it.

598
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:02.420
Don't you get it?

599
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:06.823
I chose you because you were
the most pathetic little bug in the joint.

600
00:37:07.029 --> 00:37:10.903
I was gonna let you become part
of my most erotic fantasies,

601
00:37:10.988 --> 00:37:13.302
but now you can just forget that.

602
00:37:13.389 --> 00:37:17.142
Write it off, you know. I guess
what you prefer is old Blood and Guts.

603
00:37:17.228 --> 00:37:21.298
This guy's idea of a romantic night out
is two seats at a public execution.

604
00:37:21.868 --> 00:37:24.586
Boy. You really chose the right husband.

605
00:37:24.668 --> 00:37:26.502
For your information,

606
00:37:26.588 --> 00:37:29.185
the General and I are deeply,

607
00:37:29.268 --> 00:37:32.945
deeply in... engaged.

608
00:37:33.028 --> 00:37:36.018
You come right back down here
this instant!

609
00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:39.661
We are marching straight back
to the colony so that I...

610
00:37:44.907 --> 00:37:46.664
The monolith!

611
00:37:46.747 --> 00:37:48.100
...stupid little bug you are!

612
00:37:48.186 --> 00:37:50.576
Absolutely. Wonderful.
That's an appealing offer.

613
00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:55.576
But, considering the options, you go back.
Okay? 'Cause I'm going on to Insectopia.

614
00:37:55.826 --> 00:37:59.296
Oh. Come on. "Insectopia"?

615
00:37:59.786 --> 00:38:01.184
You're crazier than I thought.

616
00:38:01.506 --> 00:38:05.543
Yeah? Well, I happen to have
it on a very reliable source.

617
00:38:06.506 --> 00:38:10.140
Or... Or should I say,
a drunk, raving source?

618
00:38:10.225 --> 00:38:14.142
But the point is,
I'm convinced the place definitely exists.

619
00:38:14.585 --> 00:38:18.176
Stop! I order you to stop, worker!

620
00:38:18.265 --> 00:38:21.539
Hey. I got a name. Okay? It's Z.

621
00:38:21.785 --> 00:38:24.099
And out here, you can't order me around.

622
00:38:24.745 --> 00:38:27.299
All right. Fine. No problem.

623
00:38:41.864 --> 00:38:45.454
Worker! Worker!
Where are you?

624
00:38:45.943 --> 00:38:49.818
Z? Z? Wait for me.

625
00:38:51.303 --> 00:38:54.337
No more excuses, General.
I want my daughter back.

626
00:38:55.423 --> 00:38:58.020
Frankly, I'm beginning to doubt
your ability to handle this.

627
00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:01.620
Believe me, Your Highness,
we will spare no effort to bring her back.

628
00:39:01.982 --> 00:39:06.140
Princess Bala is essential
to all our plans for the future.

629
00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:11.536
So he kills himself a hundred termites,
gets a few medals,

630
00:39:11.622 --> 00:39:14.776
then bada-bing, bada-bip,
bags himself the princess.

631
00:39:14.862 --> 00:39:17.176
He looks him dead in the eye
and says, "Bite me."

632
00:39:17.262 --> 00:39:19.335
He said that to General Mandible?

633
00:39:19.422 --> 00:39:21.931
Buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

634
00:39:22.182 --> 00:39:24.496
You heard about the war hero named Z?

635
00:39:25.021 --> 00:39:26.538
Runs off with the princess, right?

636
00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:31.094
When they sent the guards after him,
he just looks at 'em and boom!

637
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.218
- They burst into flames.
- Z? You talkin' about Z?

638
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.177
Hey, I know the guy.
He's a friend of mine.

639
00:39:37.261 --> 00:39:38.571
I think your information...

640
00:39:38.661 --> 00:39:42.655
- You know Z?
- Yeah. He's a worker. He used to dig here.

641
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:46.974
A worker? That's impossible.
A worker can't do anything, except work.

642
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.090
Yeah. It's not like we got a choice.

643
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.497
We do have a choice.
Uh, I mean, look at Z.

644
00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:54.730
He decided he wanted something,
and he went for it.

645
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.856
He's not alone.

646
00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.897
I used to be a soldier,
and I switched places with him.

647
00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:02.253
Wait a second. You're tellin' me
I don't have to be here?

648
00:40:02.339 --> 00:40:03.452
We've got a choice?

649
00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:06.902
The authorities don't want you
to know about it,

650
00:40:06.979 --> 00:40:08.715
but we don't have to work
on the tunnel anymore.

651
00:40:08.738 --> 00:40:10.812
It's the workers who control
the means of production.

652
00:40:10.898 --> 00:40:12.971
If Z don't dig, I don't dig.

653
00:40:13.059 --> 00:40:15.089
People, what is this?
An encounter group?

654
00:40:15.938 --> 00:40:18.208
- Let's get back to work.
- Why?

655
00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:22.412
...on the tunnel anymore!
This guy, Z, he's leadin' the revolution!

656
00:40:23.018 --> 00:40:24.859
I'll... get back to you.

657
00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:36.014
Think about it, Z. Two ants.

658
00:40:36.817 --> 00:40:41.367
Who ever heard of two ants?
Two million ants, maybe. But two?

659
00:40:43.016 --> 00:40:46.966
Look, I'm hungry, I'm thirsty,

660
00:40:47.337 --> 00:40:49.967
and this whole desert thing?

661
00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:52.369
It just doesn't work for me.

662
00:40:53.056 --> 00:40:55.806
- Yada, yada, yada, yada.
- I think it's about time you take me back.

663
00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.849
Take yourself back. Sheesh.

664
00:40:58.536 --> 00:41:02.006
Excuse me. You kidnapped me, remember?

665
00:41:02.976 --> 00:41:05.410
That means you have
certain responsibilities.

666
00:41:05.495 --> 00:41:08.333
You can't just abandon me
here in the wilderness.

667
00:41:08.415 --> 00:41:10.608
Yeah, well, it's better than
being back at the colony.

668
00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:14.013
- You're not serious, are you?
- Maybe you were living the high life,

669
00:41:14.095 --> 00:41:15.885
but personally, this beats digging.

670
00:41:16.375 --> 00:41:19.023
If you'd ever done a day's labor,
you'd know what I was talking about.

671
00:41:21.014 --> 00:41:23.852
"Labor"? What do you know about labor?

672
00:41:23.934 --> 00:41:26.411
How would you feel
if you were expected to give birth

673
00:41:26.494 --> 00:41:28.884
every ten seconds
for the rest of your life?

674
00:41:29.534 --> 00:41:30.493
Gee.

675
00:41:31.214 --> 00:41:32.208
Water!

676
00:41:36.574 --> 00:41:39.008
Ahh. All you think about is yourself.

677
00:41:39.454 --> 00:41:41.768
Yeah? Well, nobody else
ever thought about me.

678
00:41:41.853 --> 00:41:44.450
So as far as I'm concerned,
I don't need anybody else.

679
00:41:44.853 --> 00:41:49.010
Help! Help me, Bala!

680
00:41:52.252 --> 00:41:55.362
Help! B-B-B-B-Bala!

681
00:41:55.452 --> 00:41:57.286
Hold on. I'll get you out. Hold on.

682
00:41:58.492 --> 00:42:00.403
Help, Ba...

683
00:42:20.531 --> 00:42:22.724
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

684
00:42:23.771 --> 00:42:26.806
Now, maybe we can put
this fantasy behind us

685
00:42:27.451 --> 00:42:29.045
and head back to the colo...

686
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.888
Oh, Z! What are you doing?

687
00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:36.721
- We've gotta cross the lake.
- Am I missing something here?

688
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:38.923
Didn't we just get out of the water?

689
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.567
Bala, look, what have you got to lose?

690
00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.167
I mean, think about it.

691
00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:49.003
Do you really want to be
Mrs. Raving Lunatic?

692
00:42:52.249 --> 00:42:53.679
There's a better place.

693
00:42:55.129 --> 00:42:56.723
Z, please.

694
00:42:57.369 --> 00:43:00.043
Just... gimme one chance.

695
00:43:00.128 --> 00:43:02.159
If we don't find Insectopia soon,

696
00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:05.042
I promise I'll take you back
to the colony.

697
00:43:19.928 --> 00:43:21.761
I hope you know what you're doing.

698
00:43:22.328 --> 00:43:23.365
Yeah, me, too.

699
00:43:31.927 --> 00:43:35.037
We want Z! We want Z!

700
00:43:35.127 --> 00:43:36.764
People, come on.

701
00:43:37.687 --> 00:43:39.717
I know some ants
who aren't gonna make their quota.

702
00:43:40.007 --> 00:43:42.244
Buzz off, pawn of the oppressor.

703
00:43:42.327 --> 00:43:47.685
We want Z! We want Z!

704
00:43:48.326 --> 00:43:52.156
Sorry, sir. I came as soon as I heard.
I was debriefing the trackers.

705
00:43:52.246 --> 00:43:55.595
- And? What's the report?
- Well, this Z, sir.

706
00:43:55.926 --> 00:43:57.596
He's one slippery character.

707
00:43:57.686 --> 00:44:00.883
They lost Bala's trail
at the edge of the lake.

708
00:44:00.966 --> 00:44:02.002
The lake?

709
00:44:02.086 --> 00:44:05.719
<i>♪ All we are saying ♪</i>

710
00:44:05.805 --> 00:44:09.198
<i>♪ Is give Z a chance ♪</i>

711
00:44:09.685 --> 00:44:11.279
What's that soldier doing there?

712
00:44:11.605 --> 00:44:15.522
It appears he's holding hands, sir,
with a worker.

713
00:44:16.765 --> 00:44:18.491
I don't like the way
things are going, Cutter.

714
00:44:19.124 --> 00:44:20.913
I'm counting on you for results.

715
00:44:21.964 --> 00:44:24.158
- Now, can I depend on you or not?
- Yes, sir.

716
00:44:24.404 --> 00:44:26.161
All right, then. Let's wrap this up.

717
00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:32.034
We want Z! We want Z!

718
00:44:32.124 --> 00:44:34.394
I've heard a lot about this Z.

719
00:44:36.323 --> 00:44:40.273
I even had the pleasure
of meeting him once.

720
00:44:41.643 --> 00:44:43.193
But where is he now?

721
00:44:44.123 --> 00:44:45.520
Can anyone point him out?

722
00:44:47.683 --> 00:44:50.313
I mean, if this Z cares so much about us,

723
00:44:51.283 --> 00:44:52.952
then why isn't he here?

724
00:44:54.642 --> 00:44:55.919
I'll tell you why.

725
00:44:56.362 --> 00:44:59.352
Because Z doesn't give a damn about us.

726
00:45:01.522 --> 00:45:05.199
That's why he kidnapped our princess.
That's why he ran away.

727
00:45:06.482 --> 00:45:10.192
Z is no hero. We are the heroes.

728
00:45:10.881 --> 00:45:14.318
We are the ones ensuring
the future of our great colony.

729
00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.471
And when we've completed
this magnificent structure,

730
00:45:19.001 --> 00:45:20.715
we will reap the benefits:

731
00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:23.995
more food and less work for everyone.

732
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.031
And as further reward
for your heroic efforts,

733
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.994
and every one of you will get the day off!

734
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.878
So you can be the guests of honor
at the MegaTunnel dedication ceremonies!

735
00:45:43.759 --> 00:45:54.393
Mandible! Mandible!

736
00:45:54.479 --> 00:45:55.996
Now bring me that soldier.

737
00:46:34.797 --> 00:46:39.107
Oh, my God! Z! Come here!

738
00:46:53.356 --> 00:46:54.950
It's Insectopia!

739
00:46:58.955 --> 00:47:01.509
You were right. It really is here.

740
00:47:13.874 --> 00:47:16.788
- Huh?
- All right. All right!

741
00:47:16.874 --> 00:47:18.511
- You're a genius.
- Let's eat.

742
00:47:23.394 --> 00:47:24.867
Huh.

743
00:47:31.074 --> 00:47:33.191
Well? What's the problem?

744
00:47:33.393 --> 00:47:36.787
There's some kind of force field.

745
00:47:39.113 --> 00:47:43.511
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
How do you get in?

746
00:47:46.393 --> 00:47:49.503
Yes, well, I'm afraid
this is a private function.

747
00:47:49.832 --> 00:47:54.066
- Who are your friends, dear?
- Crawling insects, poopsie.

748
00:47:54.152 --> 00:47:56.825
Oh! The poor dears.

749
00:47:57.352 --> 00:48:00.942
Uh, good morning.

750
00:48:01.352 --> 00:48:03.185
- Huh?
- Darling, really?

751
00:48:03.272 --> 00:48:06.785
Greeting every insect
that emerges out of the grass?

752
00:48:06.872 --> 00:48:10.986
Pardon me. I guess you don't recognize me.

753
00:48:13.191 --> 00:48:17.622
I've been traveling and I'm all schlumpy.

754
00:48:18.231 --> 00:48:19.748
I'm Princess Bala.

755
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:24.541
Oh! It's even worse. They're Eurotrash.

756
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.304
Darling, they're poor.
They're dirty. They're smelly.

757
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:30.587
We have to help them.

758
00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.864
Just wait right here.
We'll fetch you a little something.

759
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:38.300
Oh, please, Muffy. Not another crusade.

760
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.500
Chippie, we have a social obligation
to the less fortunate.

761
00:48:43.709 --> 00:48:47.420
I know you laugh at my hobbies,
but this is important to me!

762
00:48:47.669 --> 00:48:50.539
Mm. You have such a big heart.

763
00:48:51.069 --> 00:48:53.699
That's why you're
my little cuddly-widdles.

764
00:48:53.788 --> 00:48:58.458
Oh, my big, strong pheromone factory.

765
00:48:59.588 --> 00:49:01.618
- Mm!
- Oh!

766
00:49:01.988 --> 00:49:05.186
Oh, brother.
Suddenly I've lost my appetite.

767
00:49:05.788 --> 00:49:07.185
- You know...
- Oh!

768
00:49:07.268 --> 00:49:09.265
I guess I had imagined Insectopia...

769
00:49:10.788 --> 00:49:12.425
I don't know, a little differently.

770
00:49:18.627 --> 00:49:19.817
Oh, Muffy!

771
00:49:19.907 --> 00:49:23.224
- No! Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

772
00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:26.263
Look out!

773
00:49:30.467 --> 00:49:31.940
Z, help me!

774
00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:34.265
Z!

775
00:49:34.586 --> 00:49:36.976
Don't let me... Don't let me go, Z.

776
00:49:42.106 --> 00:49:43.895
Get me out of here!

777
00:49:48.586 --> 00:49:49.545
Bala!

778
00:49:56.985 --> 00:49:58.535
Whoa, this is not good.

779
00:50:05.104 --> 00:50:06.534
Whoa!

780
00:50:08.704 --> 00:50:10.615
Whoa-oa-oa!

781
00:50:41.182 --> 00:50:43.016
Whoa-oa-oa!

782
00:50:51.262 --> 00:50:52.221
Hi.

783
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.058
- Z?
- Yes?

784
00:51:01.381 --> 00:51:06.139
It looks like this is it, just when...
I was starting to like you.

785
00:51:15.701 --> 00:51:17.894
Who the hell is that?

786
00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:31.899
That's enough.

787
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.577
I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

788
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.810
Soldier, the princess is vital
to the future of this colony.

789
00:51:41.539 --> 00:51:44.289
She must be returned
to take her proper place as queen.

790
00:51:44.379 --> 00:51:46.377
We already have a queen.

791
00:51:46.819 --> 00:51:49.689
As for your friend Z,
why should I hurt him?

792
00:51:50.418 --> 00:51:52.328
He's not important.

793
00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:54.932
Now, soldier,

794
00:51:55.578 --> 00:51:58.613
we all know that one individual ant
doesn't matter.

795
00:51:59.898 --> 00:52:00.857
Not you...

796
00:52:01.978 --> 00:52:03.255
not Cutter...

797
00:52:03.857 --> 00:52:06.127
Not even her.

798
00:52:06.578 --> 00:52:08.695
Azteca!

799
00:52:08.778 --> 00:52:11.092
Don't tell that tight-ass anything,
Weaver! Ahh!

800
00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:13.327
Where is Z?

801
00:52:13.578 --> 00:52:15.095
I don't know where he is!

802
00:52:15.417 --> 00:52:17.731
Hm. That's too bad.

803
00:52:25.497 --> 00:52:26.456
Wait!

804
00:52:27.456 --> 00:52:28.526
Insectopia!

805
00:52:28.896 --> 00:52:32.246
Uh! I know it sounds crazy,
but that's where he'd be going.

806
00:52:32.336 --> 00:52:37.410
Soldier, you think this is a game?
Insectopia does not exist.

807
00:52:37.496 --> 00:52:40.770
As a matter of fact... it does.

808
00:52:41.256 --> 00:52:42.010
Sir?

809
00:52:42.096 --> 00:52:43.569
I'll brief you on the coordinates.

810
00:52:44.175 --> 00:52:45.725
You're gonna bring the princess back.

811
00:52:46.736 --> 00:52:49.005
And as for Z... kill him.

812
00:52:50.095 --> 00:52:52.888
But you said he didn't matter.

813
00:52:52.975 --> 00:52:56.488
It's for the good of the colony.
You made the right decision.

814
00:52:58.695 --> 00:53:03.813
Gentlemen, now you can see
how dangerous individualism can be.

815
00:53:04.374 --> 00:53:07.332
It makes us... vulnerable.

816
00:53:09.054 --> 00:53:10.013
Let's go.

817
00:53:12.534 --> 00:53:16.168
Take him back to the MegaTunnel.
Put him on the front line.

818
00:53:17.813 --> 00:53:18.772
Dismissed.

819
00:53:27.173 --> 00:53:31.691
Jeez, what was I thinking?
I almost got you killed.

820
00:53:32.052 --> 00:53:35.566
Z, you know, you really
shouldn't be so hard on...

821
00:53:35.652 --> 00:53:39.483
That's it.
I'm taking you back to the colony.

822
00:53:39.573 --> 00:53:41.526
- Uh! Ow! Oh.
- Uh!

823
00:53:42.692 --> 00:53:46.610
- Insectopia? I must've been crazy.
- Z?

824
00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:48.930
But you know what?
I can admit it when I'm wrong.

825
00:53:49.012 --> 00:53:50.529
- Z.
- And this time, I gotta tell ya,

826
00:53:50.612 --> 00:53:53.329
I was absolutely, 100%...

827
00:53:54.971 --> 00:53:56.041
correct!

828
00:53:57.252 --> 00:54:02.565
Have... Have you ever seen
anything more beautiful in your life?

829
00:54:02.931 --> 00:54:07.165
- It's... Insect...
- Shh! Don't jinx it. Come on!

Mm.

849
00:56:11.884 --> 00:56:15.594
- This stuff tastes like crap.
- Really? Let me try some.

850
00:56:17.483 --> 00:56:20.518
Hey, it is crap. Not bad.

851
00:56:21.763 --> 00:56:25.801
- Somebody needs to feed that fire.
- Dude, I did it last time.

852
00:56:25.883 --> 00:56:28.601
I'm not gonna get it. It's not my job.

853
00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:30.753
Well, what about the new guy?

854
00:56:30.843 --> 00:56:32.677
He hasn't contributed yet.

855
00:56:33.403 --> 00:56:36.916
And... you know,
he just died in my arms like that.

856
00:56:37.003 --> 00:56:43.113
I... You know, I don't think he ever once
in his life made his own choice.

857
00:56:44.762 --> 00:56:46.311
I never knew it was like that.

858
00:56:47.562 --> 00:56:49.112
I mean, up in the palace...

859
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:53.639
Well, I guess we just let the General
make all the decisions.

860
00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:57.275
Let me ask you something.

861
00:56:58.161 --> 00:57:00.114
What made you come to the bar that night?

862
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.634
I guess I was looking for
a little trouble.

863
00:57:03.721 --> 00:57:06.198
Well, trouble's my middle name.

864
00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.310
Actually, my middle name is Marion, but...

865
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.914
- I don't want you to spread that around.
- You're pretty strange.

866
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.670
You do know that, don't you?

867
00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:18.197
Well, "strange" is not exactly
the word I would use.

868
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.150
- You know, I...
- I like it. You're not like anyone else.

869
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.910
Actually, now that you mention it,
there is a certain strangeness to me.

870
00:57:25.999 --> 00:57:28.793
I mean, it's a, you know,
kind of a bizarre quality.

871
00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:30.789
Some have said "freak."

872
00:57:30.879 --> 00:57:33.356
But it's, uh, you know, complimentary.

873
00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:40.589
Hey, new guy! We need more wood!

874
00:57:43.079 --> 00:57:45.992
I'll be right back.
Just hold that thought.

875
00:57:46.078 --> 00:57:47.955
Whatever it is you were thinking.

876
00:57:49.438 --> 00:57:52.035
Hey, you ever wonder why
they call you guys "pests"?

877
00:57:53.478 --> 00:57:56.675
What if, like,
we're just these tiny little things,

878
00:57:56.758 --> 00:58:01.756
and we're just, like, part of this whole
other huge universe that's, like,

879
00:58:01.837 --> 00:58:04.314
so big we don't even know it exists?

880
00:58:04.757 --> 00:58:07.987
Man, that is so deep.

881
00:58:08.397 --> 00:58:09.194
Perfect!

882
00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:13.075
Nothing like a little manual labor
on the most romantic night of my life.

883
00:58:18.796 --> 00:58:19.755
Hi.

884
00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:22.747
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd drop in.

885
00:58:24.117 --> 00:58:27.674
This is, uh... very bohemian.

886
00:58:27.996 --> 00:58:31.466
Aloha, dude. Welcome to Insec...

887
00:58:31.555 --> 00:58:32.514
...topia.

888
00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:34.906
Sorry for interrupting.

889
00:58:36.675 --> 00:58:40.909
You see, our princess
has, uh, gone missing,

890
00:58:40.996 --> 00:58:43.069
and we're just sick about it.

891
00:58:44.675 --> 00:58:48.353
She's about yea tall,
fairly easy on the eyes.

892
00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:52.068
- Anybody seen her?
- There she is. That's her. Yeah.

893
00:58:53.555 --> 00:58:56.829
Don't worry, Princess,
you'll be back home soon.

894
00:58:57.394 --> 00:59:00.145
Listen, Cutter, I'm... I'm not going back.

895
00:59:00.634 --> 00:59:03.668
The thing is,
Princess, I got orders.

896
00:59:04.034 --> 00:59:04.993
Orders?

897
00:59:05.153 --> 00:59:07.784
Can't you just once think for yourself?

898
00:59:09.314 --> 00:59:11.628
Well, that was very impressive.

899
00:59:12.074 --> 00:59:13.264
Where's Z?

900
00:59:13.953 --> 00:59:16.190
- Z? He's, uh...
- Dead!

901
00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:18.667
Z's dead.

902
00:59:19.513 --> 00:59:21.030
You don't need to worry about him.

903
00:59:21.113 --> 00:59:25.511
Z's dead. Well, he was an ant with ideas.

904
00:59:26.152 --> 00:59:27.310
Too bad for him.

905
00:59:28.153 --> 00:59:30.510
Princess, your colony needs you.

906
00:59:31.072 --> 00:59:32.666
Cutter!

907
00:59:32.752 --> 00:59:35.666
- Stop right now! Let go of me!
- Bala!

908
00:59:35.992 --> 00:59:37.062
Stop, you... Hey!

909
00:59:38.152 --> 00:59:39.111
Oh, no.

910
00:59:40.272 --> 00:59:41.505
What am I gonna do?

911
00:59:42.272 --> 00:59:45.185
All right, look, look.
Let's be rational about this.

912
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:48.385
You know, Bala and I,
you know, she's a princess,

913
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:51.668
and I'm a soil-relocation engineer.

914
00:59:51.752 --> 00:59:53.301
So wha... You're no... Whew!

915
00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:55.069
On the other hand, uh...

916
00:59:56.471 --> 00:59:57.781
I've gotta go back for her.

917
00:59:58.271 --> 01:00:00.268
I'll... I'll give you a lift!

918
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.940
S- S-S... Whoa! Oh!

919
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.104
It's the least I can do.

920
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:12.108
Besides,
it's what my waddly-kittles would want.

921
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:17.624
Uh, look,
how about a cup of joe first?

922
01:00:17.709 --> 01:00:20.864
- Well, old boy, saddle up.
- I saw a puddle of coffee over there.

923
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.384
It... It... Whoa!

924
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:30.586
Look out!

925
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:34.106
Wait for my signal.

926
01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:35.945
Ah, Princess!

927
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:38.747
- You're just in time.
- Take your hands off me.

928
01:00:39.628 --> 01:00:42.346
General, what exactly is going on here?

929
01:00:42.428 --> 01:00:45.986
- I demand an explanation.
- I'll explain everything afterwards.

930
01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:48.313
- Is the southeast entrance secure?
- Yes, sir.

931
01:00:48.748 --> 01:00:50.221
Not afterwards.

932
01:00:50.588 --> 01:00:51.547
Now.

933
01:00:54.707 --> 01:00:56.224
I don't like the way you think,

934
01:00:56.308 --> 01:00:58.697
and I don't like the way
you run this colony.

935
01:00:58.948 --> 01:01:01.741
And I don't like you. The wedding is off.

936
01:01:02.027 --> 01:01:04.177
Things are going to change around here.

937
01:01:04.747 --> 01:01:05.937
You're right, Princess.

938
01:01:06.707 --> 01:01:08.060
Things are going to change.

939
01:01:08.467 --> 01:01:10.180
Why don't we make her more comfortable?

940
01:01:10.267 --> 01:01:12.100
She'll be here for a while.

941
01:01:13.946 --> 01:01:15.376
What do you think you're doing?

942
01:01:15.746 --> 01:01:17.864
My mother will have your head!

943
01:01:17.946 --> 01:01:19.857
I doubt that.

944
01:01:20.826 --> 01:01:22.976
Ah, you've got a fighter's spirit, Bala.

945
01:01:23.066 --> 01:01:25.740
And that's just what we need
to start our new colony.

946
01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:28.816
We will rinse away all
the filth from our gutters.

947
01:01:28.906 --> 01:01:32.343
We'll start anew,
with you by my side as my queen.

948
01:01:33.185 --> 01:01:34.419
You're crazy.

949
01:01:36.705 --> 01:01:38.822
I believe history will see
things differently.

950
01:01:40.105 --> 01:01:42.342
All right, gentlemen.
Time to take your positions.

951
01:01:43.065 --> 01:01:45.935
Someday... Someday you'll thank me.

952
01:01:54.664 --> 01:01:57.021
Pull up! Pull up! Ah!

953
01:01:57.864 --> 01:01:59.862
There it is!

954
01:02:03.184 --> 01:02:06.457
Well, then, go get the woman you love, Z.

955
01:02:07.703 --> 01:02:09.657
So long, Chip. And thanks.

956
01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:15.982
You there!

957
01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:17.290
Where do you think you're goin'?

958
01:02:17.343 --> 01:02:20.136
Me? Oh, no, I was just... You know, I...

959
01:02:20.223 --> 01:02:21.773
You're not supposed to be out here.

960
01:02:22.222 --> 01:02:25.212
All workers are to report
to the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

961
01:02:25.303 --> 01:02:28.380
Oh! Yes, yes, of course!
The-The tunnel-opening ceremonies.

962
01:02:28.462 --> 01:02:31.617
I... Well, I should get going, then.
I...

963
01:02:31.702 --> 01:02:32.772
You know, the...

964
01:02:33.861 --> 01:02:34.658
Hey!

965
01:02:34.742 --> 01:02:37.776
I'm going to the...
the tunnel opening ceremonies.

966
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:39.772
- I'd better get goin'.
- Get moving.

967
01:02:40.262 --> 01:02:42.652
I'm going to the...
the tunnel-opening ceremonies.

968
01:02:44.981 --> 01:02:47.458
Excuse me, please.
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

969
01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:50.138
- Hey, worker!
- Opening the tunnel. They need me.

970
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:52.371
- I'm the key man.
- Where do you think you're going?

971
01:02:52.461 --> 01:02:54.055
Tunnel-opening ceremonies.

972
01:02:58.101 --> 01:03:00.894
Hey, come on! Let me outta here!

973
01:03:00.981 --> 01:03:01.940
Hey!

974
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:11.937
Gosh, this day just keeps getting
better and better.

975
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.933
Big trouble!

976
01:03:16.019 --> 01:03:19.773
Are you listening to me out there?
I'm a princess,

977
01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:20.929
damn it!

978
01:03:25.299 --> 01:03:27.296
Wow, your manners haven't improved much.

979
01:03:27.379 --> 01:03:28.132
Z!

980
01:03:28.178 --> 01:03:30.089
Whoa! Whoa!

981
01:03:30.179 --> 01:03:34.053
- Oh!
- It's you. You came back for me.

982
01:03:34.139 --> 01:03:38.733
Well, yeah, I came back for you.
You know, I have strong feelings for you.

983
01:03:39.058 --> 01:03:42.048
Let's face it, you're... you're...
you're beautiful. I...

984
01:03:42.738 --> 01:03:46.688
A little combative at times,
but I think we can work on that.

985
01:03:46.778 --> 01:03:48.175
You talk too much.

986
01:03:51.097 --> 01:03:54.972
Gee, I think I'm about to become
the strong, silent type.

987
01:03:56.657 --> 01:04:00.215
Come on. The city's deserted.
We'd better get outta here.

988
01:04:00.297 --> 01:04:03.374
Z... we can't go.

989
01:04:03.457 --> 01:04:06.970
Mandible's insane.
He keeps talking about

990
01:04:07.057 --> 01:04:10.887
washing away the filth
and changing history and...

991
01:04:11.217 --> 01:04:13.334
and I think he's going to try
to kill my mother.

992
01:04:13.896 --> 01:04:16.690
Not just your mother, everyone.

993
01:04:17.016 --> 01:04:18.893
- What's going on?
- Look.

994
01:04:19.536 --> 01:04:20.933
Here we are, safe in the city.

995
01:04:21.655 --> 01:04:23.727
But they're gonna seal
everybody off in the MegaTunnel.

996
01:04:24.135 --> 01:04:26.329
And... here's the lake.

997
01:04:27.055 --> 01:04:28.169
You're right.

998
01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:30.288
We can't leave now.

999
01:04:31.615 --> 01:04:33.133
Come on. We gotta get down there.

1000
01:04:34.095 --> 01:04:37.085
Today is the realization of a dream.

1001
01:04:37.815 --> 01:04:39.452
A dream of a proud colony.

1002
01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:44.049
A pure colony. A colony reborn.

1003
01:04:48.334 --> 01:04:51.325
Moments from now this tunnel will open.

1004
01:04:51.814 --> 01:04:56.092
The past will be washed away,
and a new day will dawn.

1005
01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:00.007
A stirring speech, General.

1006
01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.051
I only wish my daughter
were here to appreciate it.

1007
01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:05.971
Your Majesty, I know how concerned
you are about Bala.

1008
01:05:06.453 --> 01:05:09.608
But my scouts are on her trail
and it's only a matter of time before...

1009
01:05:09.693 --> 01:05:12.606
General, I don't want to discuss it.
Just find her.

1010
01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:14.403
I will, Your Highness.

1011
01:05:15.893 --> 01:05:16.852
Goodbye.

1012
01:05:32.812 --> 01:05:34.122
Seal up the doors.

1013
01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.322
Cutter, did you hear me?

1014
01:05:36.811 --> 01:05:38.841
Sir, I've been thinking.

1015
01:05:39.691 --> 01:05:41.285
Do we need to go through with this?

1016
01:05:41.371 --> 01:05:43.848
Look at what these workers have done.

1017
01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:47.684
They got the right stuff.
Isn't there any other way?

1018
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.364
Cutter, you're a fine officer.

1019
01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:52.081
You have discipline, courage, ability.

1020
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:56.281
But you seem to have a certain weakness
for the lower orders I find disturbing.

1021
01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:00.884
- Now, are you with me?
- Sir, uh... I apologize.

1022
01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:04.080
- All right, then. Seal it up.
- Yes, sir.

1023
01:06:16.489 --> 01:06:18.846
As I look out
on this magnificent tunnel,

1024
01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.359
I am filled with pride.

1025
01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:24.718
- Jump!
- In these difficult times,

1026
01:06:24.808 --> 01:06:28.399
it is a great solace to know
that you, our workers...

1027
01:06:28.928 --> 01:06:30.578
Mom! Wait!

1028
01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:32.482
Every worker in the colony is here.

1029
01:06:33.488 --> 01:06:35.099
Hey, wait a minute.
That guy owes me money.

1030
01:06:35.168 --> 01:06:37.645
This tremendous accomplishment
is a testimony to the strength...

1031
01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:40.402
- People! Put your backs into it!
- Go warn your mother.

1032
01:06:40.488 --> 01:06:42.878
I gotta get to those diggers
before they break through!

1033
01:06:42.968 --> 01:06:44.125
There's not enough time!

1034
01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:46.838
Hey, leave the pessimism to me, okay?

1035
01:06:47.688 --> 01:06:51.202
Ow! Ooh! Yeeow!

1036
01:06:51.287 --> 01:06:53.764
Excuse me! Sorry about that. Excuse me.

1037
01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:56.957
In a few moments when our expert diggers
break through to the surface...

1038
01:06:57.047 --> 01:06:59.481
- Mom! Mom, stop.
- ...the sun will pour into this...

1039
01:07:00.007 --> 01:07:02.321
Bala! Where've you been?
Are you all right?

1040
01:07:02.406 --> 01:07:05.124
- I'm fine.
- What happened?

1041
01:07:05.487 --> 01:07:07.517
Mother, we're in terrible danger.

1042
01:07:18.646 --> 01:07:20.676
Put your backs into it, people.

1043
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.876
Wait! Hold... Hey, stop digging!

1044
01:07:23.965 --> 01:07:26.596
- Z? Is that you?
- Weaver, stop!

1045
01:07:26.685 --> 01:07:28.878
Z! You're back!

1046
01:07:28.966 --> 01:07:30.635
- Oh, Z! Oh.
- Weaver!

1047
01:07:30.725 --> 01:07:33.279
Z! What's the matter?

1048
01:07:34.125 --> 01:07:37.115
Ho-Hold up, everyone! Stop! Stop digging!

1049
01:07:37.204 --> 01:07:39.758
- On whose authority?
- On your own authority.

1050
01:07:39.844 --> 01:07:41.962
If you break through that wall,
we're all gonna...

1051
01:07:42.044 --> 01:07:44.358
Drown! This tunnel is going to flood.

1052
01:07:44.445 --> 01:07:46.595
So we've got to get everyone out of here.

1053
01:07:48.644 --> 01:07:52.202
Look, I got orders,
and those orders say "dig."

1054
01:07:52.283 --> 01:07:54.957
What if someone ordered you
to jump off a bridge? Ju-Ju-Ju...

1055
01:07:55.763 --> 01:08:00.074
Brother, I'm asking the wrong guy here.
Look, think for yourselves!

1056
01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.917
Gimme that! I've had enough out of you.

1057
01:08:03.643 --> 01:08:04.602
Get back to work!

1058
01:08:05.483 --> 01:08:06.518
What's that noise?

1059
01:08:08.123 --> 01:08:09.082
Uh-oh.

1060
01:08:10.563 --> 01:08:12.080
- Let's get outta here!
- Run!

1061
01:08:14.163 --> 01:08:16.477
Run! Run! Keep going!

1062
01:08:17.083 --> 01:08:20.760
Everyone, listen to me.
We've all been deceived.

1063
01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:24.712
We need to calmly head toward the exits.

1064
01:08:24.802 --> 01:08:28.195
- Run for your lives! It's gonna flood!
- No. Don't panic.

1065
01:08:28.282 --> 01:08:31.436
- Don't panic!
- Every ant for himself!

1066
01:08:40.481 --> 01:08:42.554
- All the exits are blocked!
- We're trapped!

1067
01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.629
- What are we going to do?
- There's nothing we can do!

1068
01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.913
Yes, there is. Weaver, give me a leg up!

1069
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:21.152
Everyone, listen to me!

1070
01:09:21.239 --> 01:09:23.716
- Who the heck are you?
- He's Z!

1071
01:09:27.159 --> 01:09:31.109
Listen, we gotta help each other
get outta here before we all drown!

1072
01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:31.995
How?

1073
01:09:32.078 --> 01:09:34.271
- By making a ladder.
- A ladder!

1074
01:09:34.358 --> 01:09:37.228
Hey, if we built this, we can do anything.

1075
01:09:37.558 --> 01:09:41.072
- Okay, let's move it!
- I'm on it. All of you, gather round.

1076
01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:42.391
You, start climbing.

1077
01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:46.791
- Grab my arm.
- All right. Here I go.

1078
01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.547
- Go, go, go!
- All right!

1079
01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.474
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1080
01:09:54.717 --> 01:09:57.074
Z, I've gotta help my mom.

1081
01:09:57.677 --> 01:09:58.473
Don't worry.

1082
01:09:58.557 --> 01:10:00.630
I know almost exactly what I'm doing.

1083
01:10:03.357 --> 01:10:04.514
I'll see you at the top.

1084
01:10:08.756 --> 01:10:14.114
Gentlemen, there comes a time
in the evolution of a perfect colony

1085
01:10:14.395 --> 01:10:17.550
when the strong are meant
to rise above the weak.

1086
01:10:18.876 --> 01:10:21.026
Now is that time.

1087
01:10:21.915 --> 01:10:26.226
<i>Below us right now,
the weak elements of the colony</i>

1088
01:10:26.315 --> 01:10:27.625
<i>are being washed away.</i>

1089
01:10:29.195 --> 01:10:33.025
Oh, my God, we're not gonna make it!

1090
01:10:33.115 --> 01:10:35.908
- We need more ants.
- You two better get up there.

1091
01:10:35.995 --> 01:10:38.232
Weaver, you can't hold it alone.

1092
01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:39.864
Get going!

1093
01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:41.904
Hang in there, buddy.

1094
01:10:56.314 --> 01:10:58.791
- Got it!
- Hurry up! Go, go, go, go!

1095
01:11:02.393 --> 01:11:06.310
Our princess is secured,
and our glorious future is at hand.

1096
01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:08.462
We can all stand proud.

1097
01:11:08.913 --> 01:11:11.423
It is time for a new beginning.

1098
01:11:21.592 --> 01:11:24.626
What the hell is that?

1099
01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:27.022
I think that's the weak elements, sir.

1100
01:11:27.112 --> 01:11:30.505
- Gimme a hand!
- Z! You?

1101
01:11:31.191 --> 01:11:35.502
Let go! Don't you understand?
It's for the good of the colony.

1102
01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:38.668
What are you saying? We are the colony!

1103
01:11:42.631 --> 01:11:43.590
Cutter!

1104
01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:45.024
What are you doing?

1105
01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:48.068
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

1106
01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:51.424
This is for the good of the colony, sir.

1107
01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.424
You useless, ungrateful maggot!

1108
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:58.260
- I am the colony!
- Look out!

1109
01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:02.060
Oof! Ah!

1110
01:12:09.069 --> 01:12:10.028
Z!

1111
01:12:11.429 --> 01:12:14.626
Men, let's move it!
Get these ants up here.

1112
01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:20.825
- Keep it moving.
- Thank goodness we made it.

1113
01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:27.427
Wait here.

1114
01:12:36.427 --> 01:12:38.425
- Uh! Okay.
- Thank you. Ooh!

1115
01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:39.667
Weaver!

1116
01:12:41.147 --> 01:12:42.217
Where's Z?

1117
01:12:50.587 --> 01:12:51.546
Oh, no.

1118
01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:54.377
Back up, everybody, back up!

1119
01:12:54.467 --> 01:12:58.057
- Give him some air. Back up!
- Z, oh, Z.

1120
01:13:02.506 --> 01:13:03.816
Please wake up.

1121
01:13:06.185 --> 01:13:07.299
Oh, no!

1122
01:13:12.426 --> 01:13:15.176
Huh!

1123
01:13:22.145 --> 01:13:23.182
Yowch!

1124
01:13:24.745 --> 01:13:27.899
You know, Weaver,
you still owe me that dinner.

1125
01:13:29.264 --> 01:13:30.223
Baby love.

1126
01:13:31.505 --> 01:13:34.375
- We made it, Z!
- You da ant!

1127
01:13:35.144 --> 01:13:37.097
- Eh!
- You did it.

1128
01:13:37.544 --> 01:13:38.503
We did it.

1129
01:13:40.384 --> 01:13:42.021
- Fellas, fellas, please.
- Oh! Oh!

1130
01:13:42.104 --> 01:13:44.418
This is very embarrassing for me, I...

1131
01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:48.137
On the other hand,
I probably could get used to this.

1132
01:13:51.264 --> 01:13:53.653
<i>There you have it.
Your average "boy meets girl,</i>

1133
01:13:53.743 --> 01:13:57.661
<i>boy likes girl, boy changes
underlying social order" story.</i>

1134
01:13:58.703 --> 01:14:00.056
<i>So, what else can I tell you?</i>

1135
01:14:00.543 --> 01:14:03.140
<i>We rebuilt the colony.
It's even better than before,</i>

1136
01:14:03.223 --> 01:14:06.540
<i>you know, 'cause now it has
a very large indoor swimming pool.</i>

1137
01:14:07.023 --> 01:14:10.057
<i>Bala and I, incidentally,
are thinking of starting a family,</i>

1138
01:14:10.382 --> 01:14:14.496
<i>you know, just a few kids,
maybe a million or two to begin with.</i>

1139
01:14:14.822 --> 01:14:18.936
<i>And I'm workin' with a new therapist,
you know, terrific, absolutely terrific.</i>

1140
01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:22.099
<i>He's been putting me in touch
with my inner maggot,</i>

1141
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.578
<i>which is helping me a great deal.</i>

1142
01:14:23.662 --> 01:14:26.936
<i>And, you know, I finally feel like
I've found my place.</i>

1143
01:14:27.021 --> 01:14:29.259
<i>And you know what?
It's right back where I started.</i>

1144
01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:33.015
