1
00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:05.812
All right, who's ready
to have a good time, huh?

2
00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:07.855
That's right.
So welcome here.

3
00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.149
Uh, show of hands,
how many people have been

4
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.567
to a taping
of a TV show before?

5
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:13.069
Thank you.

6
00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:16.739
Okay, just remember,
the movie's hilarious.

7
00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:18.032
Everyone buy tickets.

8
00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.326
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah?

9
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.470
Do you think I'm good
in the movie?

10
00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:22.680
Come on, Kev,
I'm your agent.

11
00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:24.265
Of course, I think you're good
in the movie.

12
00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.332
You know who else thinks
you're good in the movie?

13
00:00:26.416 --> 00:00:28.376
The studio.
Now, go knock 'em dead.

14
00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:31.045
Big smiles, big laughs,
you're America's funny man.

15
00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.274
The house band's gonna
play a little bit for ya,

16
00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:34.358
and, uh, we're gonna have
a great time, all right?

17
00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:36.092
America's funny man.

18
00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:41.639
Oh, now, Kev,
people are just raving

19
00:00:41.723 --> 00:00:42.974
about this new movie
of yours.

20
00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:44.809
Oh, my God,
they are raving.

21
00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:48.187
You are working with
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

22
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:50.273
playing
his comedy sidekick again.

23
00:00:50.356 --> 00:00:51.858
What is this,
the sixth time now?

24
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:54.277
- Number six.
- How do you keep it so fresh?

25
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.030
I mean, look,
Dwayne and I are, um,

26
00:00:57.113 --> 00:00:57.989
you know, we're friends.

27
00:00:58.072 --> 00:00:59.324
- Lucky.
- Hashtag, Jealous.

28
00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:03.536
He's lucky, too.
He's lucky, too.

29
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.246
But, I mean, look,
when you are friends,

30
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.664
you feed off of each other,

31
00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:08.624
that energy, of course,
transfers.

32
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:10.060
But, uh, I don't know,
I would like to think

33
00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:13.254
of my-my characters
as-as heroes as well.

34
00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:19.177
I don't know...
I don't know why the laugh.

35
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.928
I'm very serious.

36
00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:22.805
You know, I've actually
I've been...

37
00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.489
I've been trying to become
a leading man,

38
00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:26.726
you know, do more
of an action star thing,

39
00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:28.978
but I've been-I've been
somewhat typecast.

40
00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:30.414
For some reason, people only
see me as the funny guy.

41
00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:31.647
- You make me laugh.
- No.

42
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:32.648
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

43
00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:33.834
Glad-glad, you know,
appreciate it.

44
00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:36.110
I'm not an easy audience.

45
00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:37.254
Yeah, you know,
but it's just it's...

46
00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:39.614
I can do more
than show up

47
00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:42.283
and do the funny
or do the dance. I'm...

48
00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.635
- Would you, though?
- Would you do that dance?

49
00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.659
- Come on.
- Come on!

50
00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:47.663
Who wants to see
Kevin dance, huh?

51
00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:50.249
We'll get
the "Macarena" going.

52
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.919
No. No.

53
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.337
I'm not...
I'm not gonna dance.

54
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.814
Next time.
Next time then, for sure.

55
00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:57.131
Now, here's just a question.

56
00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:00.343
Like, okay, when you...
when you see Idris Elba, right,

57
00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:02.506
you see him and you go,
"Wow, that's an action star".

58
00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:05.181
But if you took
six inches off of Idris,

59
00:02:05.264 --> 00:02:06.724
nobody...
nobody's gonna give a shit.

60
00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:08.226
- Okay-okay, just...
- Okay.

61
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.395
Gentle reminder here,
it's a live broadcast.

62
00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:11.896
Got it.
But you get my point.

63
00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.272
Nobody's gonna care.
- Right.

64
00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:14.565
All right,
if he was smaller.

65
00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.210
I mean, I don't think
I know any action stars

66
00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:18.653
that are 5'7".
Can we name one?

67
00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:21.572
There's, um...
Oh, there's Mr. Tom Cruise.

68
00:02:21.656 --> 00:02:22.824
Oh, wonderful.

69
00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:24.510
Who we love.
A favorite here on the show.

70
00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.095
Okay. Tom Cruise.
That's one. All right.

71
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:27.453
- Jackie Chan.
- Yeah!

72
00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.872
- Isn't he great.
- Oh, he's a little guy.

73
00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:32.041
I feel like
you're being a dick.

74
00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.460
Is-Is this a bit?

75
00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:36.129
Are you guys...
is this a bit?

76
00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:38.673
I-I think it may have been.
Getting back to the movie,

77
00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.842
tell us-tell us
just how great this movie is.

78
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.302
The, uh,
the movie's garbage.

79
00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:46.431
- Sorry?
- Yeah, the movie's garbage.

80
00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:49.100
Take the movie, ball it up,
throw it in the trash can.

81
00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.477
How many times do you need
to see me in a car

82
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.396
with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson?

83
00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.149
And I'm the comedy sidekick,
and he's saving lives,

84
00:02:56.232 --> 00:02:58.526
and I got a catchphrase,
"Oh, hell no"?

85
00:02:58.609 --> 00:02:59.485
We love it
when you say that.

86
00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.320
Oh, good.
Can you do it again?

87
00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.865
Here's my question.
Why can't I be an action star?

88
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:07.118
I read something online
about you being afraid

89
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:08.619
of woodland creatures.

90
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:10.037
- Oh, yes.
- About me what?

91
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:11.181
Beaver?
It was it a squirrel?

92
00:03:11.205 --> 00:03:12.123
- Squirrel.
- A squirrel.

93
00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.082
- It was a squirrel.
- Yes.

94
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.000
That you have a fear
of squirrels.

95
00:03:14.083 --> 00:03:15.001
Who's afraid of a squirrel?

96
00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:16.437
I'm not fuckin' afraid
of a squirrel.

97
00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:17.795
- Okay.
- Ooh.

98
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:18.981
- I'm not afraid of shit!
- Okay, you've said it.

99
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.774
You've made your point there.
- I'm not afraid of shit,

100
00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:22.717
and I'm more than just a guy
that does comedy.

101
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.552
I'm a fuckin' action star,
all right?

102
00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.488
So why don't you start
taking me a little serious?

103
00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:28.347
Tell me what I am
and what I'm not.

104
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:29.991
If I didn't have
what the fuck it takes,

105
00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:32.101
would I show this?
Or that?

106
00:03:34.937 --> 00:03:35.771
Back up.
- Yep.

107
00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:36.939
Kev, Kev, Kev.

108
00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:38.125
Kev, hey, you gotta go
back out there.

109
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:39.192
Say it was a joke.

110
00:03:39.275 --> 00:03:40.711
I'm not telling them
it was a joke.

111
00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:41.944
You don't get it, man.

112
00:03:42.028 --> 00:03:43.505
All right? I'm trying
to be taken seriously.

113
00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.740
My whole life, I've dreamed
of becoming an action hero.

114
00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:47.909
Well, you know,
maybe instead of dreaming,

115
00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:49.344
you should just
stay in your own lane.

116
00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:51.204
What the fuck
did you just say?

117
00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:52.788
- What are you doin'?
- Ooh!

118
00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:55.708
Pssshhh...

119
00:03:57.752 --> 00:03:59.795
That was a bit.
Doin' a bit.

120
00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:05.092
<i>I'm not
afraid of!</i>

121
00:04:05.176 --> 00:04:06.445
<i>Okay, you've said it.
You've made your point there.</i>

122
00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.738
<i>- I'm not afraid of.
- Yup.</i>

123
00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:08.947
<i>And I'm more than just
a guy that does comedy.</i>

124
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:10.640
<i>I'm a action star,
all right?</i>

125
00:04:10.723 --> 00:04:12.892
<i>So why don't you start?</i>

126
00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:14.644
<i>That was our star,
Kevin Hart.</i>

127
00:04:14.727 --> 00:04:19.315
<i>And apparently he's...
going through something.</i>

128
00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:21.001
<i>To say the least.
You don't see Tom Cruise...</i>

129
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:28.342
I already know
what you're gonna say.

130
00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:30.368
You're gonna say apologize,
then after that...

131
00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:32.537
<i>No, no, no, Kev,
it's too late to apologize.</i>

132
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.498
The studio already removed you
from the fuckin' billboard.

133
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:37.625
So I'm done?
Just like that, I'm done?

134
00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.835
Maybe not.

135
00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.713
Claude Van De Velde
wants to meet with you.

136
00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:47.718
Claude Van De Velde?

137
00:04:47.802 --> 00:04:48.678
You talking about
the director?

138
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.388
Yes, Claude Van De Velde,

139
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.391
director of four of the six
biggest action movies

140
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:55.893
of all time,
saw the interview...

141
00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:57.019
and wants to meet.

142
00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:58.729
Why?

143
00:04:58.813 --> 00:05:00.356
You know what?
It don't matter.

144
00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.583
It doesn't even
fucking matter.

145
00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:04.277
I'm there.
Okay? I'm there.

146
00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:08.114
Oh, shit.

147
00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:20.042
I have seen all your films.
I like all your films.

148
00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:22.378
But you, Kevin,
you don't like your films.

149
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:25.923
- Wow, you can tell, huh?
- Of course I can tell.

150
00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:28.884
You and I,
we are the same.

151
00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:32.305
My movies have grossed
billions of dollars.

152
00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:33.556
Who cares?
- Yeah.

153
00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.392
I mean, it's not about
the money, right?

154
00:05:36.475 --> 00:05:40.479
It is about finding yourself
inside an artistic expression.

155
00:05:40.563 --> 00:05:42.231
Yes.

156
00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:45.735
I want to find you, Kevin.

157
00:05:45.818 --> 00:05:47.987
Will you let me find you?

158
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.949
You found me.
I'm right here, man.

159
00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:55.494
My next project is
a serious gritty action film.

160
00:05:55.578 --> 00:06:00.124
It requires
a serious, gritty actor.

161
00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:02.335
You, Kevin.

162
00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:05.046
I want you
in the leading role.

163
00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.548
Holy shit, man.
You gotta be...

164
00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:10.217
Excuse you. Watch it, man.
- My apologies, sir.

165
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:12.928
Mark Wahlberg would not
scream at a party server.

166
00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:15.181
Oh, I didn't scream.
I didn't scream.

167
00:06:15.264 --> 00:06:17.642
An action star
is tough, confident,

168
00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:19.268
unfazed by minor details

169
00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:22.480
that disrupt
the average person.

170
00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:24.690
Yeah, I-I was unfazed.

171
00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:25.959
I wasn't fazed
at all from that.

172
00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:28.069
If you really want
this part,

173
00:06:28.152 --> 00:06:30.821
I need you to attend
a training program.

174
00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:34.408
All the best action stars
have gone through it.

175
00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:35.844
Are you talkin'
like action star school?

176
00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:40.081
Stallone, Van Damme,
Steven Seagal,

177
00:06:40.164 --> 00:06:42.625
Jackie Chan,
they're all alums.

178
00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.251
I just kind of assumed
all those guys

179
00:06:44.335 --> 00:06:47.338
had to have the juice.
The mojo.

180
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:49.423
Do you remember
what Matt Damon

181
00:06:49.507 --> 00:06:52.385
was before
he was Jason Bourne?

182
00:06:52.468 --> 00:06:53.969
Yeah.
He just won an Oscar.

183
00:06:54.053 --> 00:06:55.680
Neither do I.

184
00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:59.392
This program turned a no-name
Matt Damon into a leading man

185
00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:01.102
revered around the world.

186
00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:03.646
Look,
with all due respect,

187
00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.691
I don't need that. I don't...
I don't need none of that.

188
00:07:06.774 --> 00:07:08.317
I'm ready now.

189
00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:11.821
I'm ready right now.

190
00:07:11.904 --> 00:07:14.532
Down here, Kevin.

191
00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:16.242
You don't think
you need training?

192
00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:18.828
You want the part
right now?

193
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:23.040
Well, your new body is waiting
for you on that rooftop.

194
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.837
Go and get it.

195
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:43.102
Oh, shit!
Ahh!

196
00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:46.063
Help! Help me!
Help me!

197
00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:47.857
So good.

198
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.442
He's doing his famous
"help me" scene

199
00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:50.985
from "Ride Along 2".
- Help!

200
00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:56.675
<i>Look, Kev,
I don't love the idea</i>

201
00:07:56.699 --> 00:07:58.409
<i>of you driving out
to the middle of nowhere</i>

202
00:07:58.492 --> 00:08:00.494
<i>- to go to some...</i>
- Action star school.

203
00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:02.204
<i>Right, yes.
That.</i>

204
00:08:02.288 --> 00:08:04.665
<i>Kev, maybe we just
wait a little longer.</i>

205
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:05.851
<i>Eventually,
the studios will forget</i>

206
00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:07.209
<i>how badly you fucked up,</i>

207
00:08:07.293 --> 00:08:08.353
<i>and they'll offer you
a new sidekick role.</i>

208
00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:11.422
No, this is my time
to shine.

209
00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:13.883
You believe in me,
don't you?

210
00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:17.261
Don't you?
Danny?

211
00:08:17.344 --> 00:08:19.889
You believe in... Oh, shit.

212
00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:21.515
Damn reception.

213
00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:31.317
Oh, hell no.

214
00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:45.039
Ron Wilcox?

215
00:08:45.122 --> 00:08:47.625
Oh, shit.

216
00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:49.627
Don't be a bitch, Kevin.

217
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.464
Be Academy Award-winning
Matt Damon.

218
00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:55.257
Get the fuck off my car.

219
00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:01.388
Uh...

220
00:09:01.472 --> 00:09:04.266
Hello?

221
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.187
Anybody here?

222
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.439
Claude Van De Velde,
he sent me.

223
00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:12.125
I don't know, you tell me
what you wanna tell me.

224
00:09:12.149 --> 00:09:14.610
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

225
00:09:14.693 --> 00:09:16.946
- Where's my nephew at?
- Uh, fellas?

226
00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.173
What do you mean
where's your nephew?

227
00:09:18.197 --> 00:09:19.674
I don't know where the fuck
your nephew is.

228
00:09:19.698 --> 00:09:24.662
- Hey, excuse me?
- Now you don't trust me?

229
00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:26.580
I know you murdered
my nephew, Rodrigo.

230
00:09:26.664 --> 00:09:29.625
Bullshit, motherfucker!
I didn't murder Rodrigo.

231
00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:32.044
Look, you got your money.
I got my shipment.

232
00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:34.088
I don't know
where Rodrigo is.

233
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.631
Maybe he's fucking
your mother.

234
00:09:35.714 --> 00:09:37.091
Oh, training
has already begun.

235
00:09:37.174 --> 00:09:39.802
Okay. Uh...

236
00:09:39.885 --> 00:09:42.096
You. You. Oh, come on!
Bring it! Bring it!

237
00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:44.139
Come on, bring that bat,
motherfucker!

238
00:09:44.223 --> 00:09:46.267
Hey!

239
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.936
You wanna
push somebody around?

240
00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:51.981
Try me out.

241
00:09:52.064 --> 00:09:55.609
Hey, and what are you,
a tough guy?

242
00:09:55.693 --> 00:09:57.403
Goddamn right,
I'm a tough guy.

243
00:09:57.486 --> 00:09:59.238
North Philadelphia tough.

244
00:09:59.321 --> 00:10:01.407
I'm Kevin motherfucking...

245
00:10:06.328 --> 00:10:10.416
Ah!

246
00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:11.876
What the hell happened?

247
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.378
Welcome to Ron Wilcox
Action Star School.

248
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.796
I'm Ron Wilcox,

249
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.172
and that was
your first lesson.

250
00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:18.696
Gettin' hit in the head
with a bat?

251
00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:21.802
Oh, you are naive.
That was a prop bat.

252
00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:24.006
It that was made of plastic.
- Wasn't goddamn plastic.

253
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:25.198
I've been hit
with a bat before,

254
00:10:25.222 --> 00:10:26.449
I know what a metal bat
fuckin' feel like.

255
00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:27.808
All right.

256
00:10:27.892 --> 00:10:30.311
Hey, Mr. Van De Velde
told me to tell him

257
00:10:30.394 --> 00:10:32.563
if you complain about
anything being too difficult.

258
00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:34.064
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

259
00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:35.166
I'm not complaining.
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.066
I'm not complaining
about nothing.

261
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.401
I loved that.

262
00:10:37.484 --> 00:10:38.319
I thought it was great,
to be honest with you,

263
00:10:38.402 --> 00:10:39.653
it gave me a rush.

264
00:10:39.737 --> 00:10:41.530
Good.
Let's take the tour.

265
00:10:41.614 --> 00:10:43.449
- Yeah.
- Come on.

266
00:10:43.532 --> 00:10:45.534
This place is to be
a slaughterhouse

267
00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:46.619
up till the '70s.

268
00:10:46.702 --> 00:10:48.329
And then,
as legend has it,

269
00:10:48.412 --> 00:10:51.165
the animals revolted
against their tormentors

270
00:10:51.248 --> 00:10:52.583
and they slaughtered
the humans.

271
00:10:52.666 --> 00:10:54.126
Oh, my God.

272
00:10:54.209 --> 00:10:56.587
And my pal, Charles Norris,
you know him as Chuck,

273
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.631
well, he needed a place
to train.

274
00:10:58.714 --> 00:11:00.591
I bought it.
I mentored him.

275
00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:03.093
And that's why he's the badass
that he is today.

276
00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:05.137
Hmm...

277
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:10.976
Yeah, he nearly died
within these walls.

278
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.189
And that's how Ron Wilcox
Action Star School got born.

279
00:11:15.272 --> 00:11:17.858
Ron Wilcox A.S.S.,
for short.

280
00:11:17.942 --> 00:11:19.526
What the fuck
did you just say to me?

281
00:11:24.573 --> 00:11:26.992
Did Matt Da...
Matt Damon, go here?

282
00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:31.288
Oh, Matty boy!
Fuck yeah, Matt Damon!

283
00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:33.290
Before he came to me,
he was a no name actor

284
00:11:33.374 --> 00:11:35.501
from New England.
He was nothing.

285
00:11:35.584 --> 00:11:38.879
He was a hundred pounds
soakin' wet.

286
00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:40.357
You sure we're talking about
the same Matt Damon?

287
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:42.049
Hell yeah.
Matt Damon!

288
00:11:42.132 --> 00:11:44.760
Huh. Okay. Yeah...

289
00:11:44.843 --> 00:11:48.430
Un-unh. Rule number one,
no phones 'til you graduate.

290
00:11:48.514 --> 00:11:49.723
Okay.
I run an empire,

291
00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:50.909
so unfortunately,
I need my...

292
00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:52.202
Okay, fine,
you know what I'll do?

293
00:11:52.226 --> 00:11:53.328
I'll just call
Mr. Van De Velde,

294
00:11:53.352 --> 00:11:55.229
and I tell him,
"Oh, the phone policy

295
00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:58.273
"wasn't working for him.
It wasn't to his liking."

296
00:11:58.357 --> 00:12:00.275
I know what
you're gonna do with this.

297
00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:01.919
You're going to make calls
to Hollywood.

298
00:12:01.944 --> 00:12:03.612
You're gonna say,
"Hello, Hollywood.

299
00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:05.197
"Ron's school
is too tough for me.

300
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.865
"I need more drugs."
- No.

301
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:08.909
Yeah, you're gonna say,
"Oh, I'm Kevin Hart.

302
00:12:08.993 --> 00:12:11.203
"I need more caviar
and champagne."

303
00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:13.706
I just wanna talk
to my employees.

304
00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:15.916
That's fine,
but I'm still keeping it.

305
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.751
Okay.

306
00:12:20.796 --> 00:12:22.840
Okay, until you graduate,

307
00:12:22.923 --> 00:12:25.259
you are forbidden from
visiting the outside world.

308
00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:27.594
You'll stay here.
- Say what?

309
00:12:27.678 --> 00:12:29.680
You got your bed,
you got your toilet,

310
00:12:29.763 --> 00:12:33.434
you got your sink.
All the modern amenities.

311
00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:41.108
Okay.

312
00:12:41.191 --> 00:12:43.652
It's supposed
to toughen me up.

313
00:12:43.736 --> 00:12:45.904
Okay, I get it.

314
00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:49.575
Yeah, I'm good with that.

315
00:12:49.658 --> 00:12:52.369
Yeah, might be a little
too good with it.

316
00:12:52.453 --> 00:12:56.415
And rule number two,
No fucking on the premises.

317
00:12:56.498 --> 00:12:59.043
No anal, no blowjobs,
no nothin'.

318
00:13:01.253 --> 00:13:04.798
Who else is here?

319
00:13:04.882 --> 00:13:06.717
Just me.

320
00:13:11.805 --> 00:13:13.557
Twenty minutes
'til lights out.

321
00:13:18.937 --> 00:13:20.064
So those...

322
00:13:20.147 --> 00:13:21.750
those two Colombian guys
that hit me in the head

323
00:13:21.774 --> 00:13:23.567
with the prop bat,
they were actors, right?

324
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.070
Yeah, exactly.

325
00:13:26.153 --> 00:13:28.572
Okay, rule number three,

326
00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:31.450
When you're under this roof,
your name is no longer Kevin,

327
00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.911
it's Agent Hart,
and you'll refer to me

328
00:13:33.994 --> 00:13:37.915
as Ron Wilcox, or Ron,
or Wilcox, or Coach Ron.

329
00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:39.041
I like Coach Ron.

330
00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:40.793
- And I refer to you as...
- Agent Hart.

331
00:13:40.876 --> 00:13:41.876
- Right.
- Right.

332
00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:43.003
- Yes.
- See, I'm on it.

333
00:13:43.087 --> 00:13:45.380
Now I assume you got me in
this FBI jacket

334
00:13:45.464 --> 00:13:47.424
and stuff for a reason.
So, what is it?

335
00:13:47.508 --> 00:13:49.259
Hey, would you do me
a favor?

336
00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:50.511
Yeah.

337
00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:53.055
Kevin, would you
grab that chair for me?

338
00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:54.056
- Yeah.
- Would you?

339
00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:55.974
- You mean this one?
- No, goddammit!

340
00:13:56.058 --> 00:13:58.393
I said respond
only to Agent Hart!

341
00:13:58.477 --> 00:14:02.815
Fuck!

342
00:14:02.898 --> 00:14:04.983
You just said that.
I fucked up. I'm sorry.

343
00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:06.227
That's not gonna
happen again.

344
00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:07.569
Why don't you just
call me Kevin?

345
00:14:07.653 --> 00:14:09.530
Okay, in your life,
have you ever heard

346
00:14:09.613 --> 00:14:14.409
an action star leading man
ever called Kevin?

347
00:14:14.493 --> 00:14:15.893
I mean, Kevin James
in "Mall Cop".

348
00:14:15.953 --> 00:14:18.413
No, no. Kevin is the name
of a punk bitch.

349
00:14:18.497 --> 00:14:21.250
Ethan Hunt,
that is an action star name.

350
00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:23.252
Tom Cruise was my alumni.

351
00:14:23.335 --> 00:14:25.170
For nine years of his life,

352
00:14:25.254 --> 00:14:27.881
he only responded
to Ethan Hunt

353
00:14:27.965 --> 00:14:30.384
whether he was
on-camera or off-camera.

354
00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:32.761
Whether he was in the shower,
or on the toilet.

355
00:14:32.845 --> 00:14:34.471
Whether he was fucking,
or not fucking.

356
00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:35.806
- Okay, I...
- If he was even...

357
00:14:35.889 --> 00:14:39.685
- I understand, Coach Ron!
- Do you? Do you really?

358
00:14:39.768 --> 00:14:43.021
I hope so, for your sake.

359
00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:45.816
Because your life
depends on it.

360
00:14:45.899 --> 00:14:48.402
Okay, next lesson.

361
00:14:48.485 --> 00:14:50.362
Every leading man
needs to know

362
00:14:50.445 --> 00:14:52.156
how to run into
a burning building

363
00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:53.574
and save a stranger.
- Hmm.

364
00:14:58.912 --> 00:15:00.455
Wow!

365
00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:02.583
Holy shit.
How'd you do that, man?

366
00:15:02.666 --> 00:15:05.252
And the stranger that
we are going to save today

367
00:15:05.335 --> 00:15:09.965
is our own action star dummy,
little Kevin.

368
00:15:11.592 --> 00:15:14.344
- That's supposed to be me?
- I don't see the resemblance.

369
00:15:14.428 --> 00:15:15.596
Are you fucking kidding?

370
00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:18.599
No, w-we've had this dummy
for years, buddy.

371
00:15:18.682 --> 00:15:21.560
<i>- Oh, hell, no.</i>
- Bitch, that's my line.

372
00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:23.288
I've said that line in,
like, twelve movies.

373
00:15:23.312 --> 00:15:24.855
Agent Hart,
are you a narcissist?

374
00:15:24.938 --> 00:15:26.273
No.

375
00:15:26.356 --> 00:15:27.584
Do you think the whole world
is all about you?

376
00:15:27.608 --> 00:15:29.151
- That's not... I'm not...
- No.

377
00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:31.195
You look at you
and then you look at him.

378
00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:33.158
- That's what...
- Look at you, and look at him.

379
00:15:33.238 --> 00:15:36.617
Do you see any resemblance?
- Kind of sort of, man!

380
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.786
O-Okay, all right.
Okay, maybe I'm crazy.

381
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.788
<i>Help!
Help me!</i>

382
00:15:41.872 --> 00:15:45.209
<i>Oh, hell no!
Help! Help me!</i>

383
00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:46.835
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>

384
00:15:46.919 --> 00:15:49.546
Now, safety during stunts
is of the utmost importance.

385
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.232
Yeah, but I mean,
that's why you got stuntmen,

386
00:15:51.256 --> 00:15:54.301
right?
- Watch it.

387
00:15:54.384 --> 00:15:55.928
No, for the other guys,
not for me.

388
00:15:56.011 --> 00:15:58.138
T-the lightweights.
I don't...

389
00:15:58.222 --> 00:16:01.099
Okay, your jacket
is flame retardant,

390
00:16:01.183 --> 00:16:03.101
which means that
if you catch on fire,

391
00:16:03.185 --> 00:16:06.146
don't panic, I will come in
and put you out.

392
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.690
Okay.
Y-You're gonna...

393
00:16:08.774 --> 00:16:10.460
Okay, I feel-I feel good...
I feel good about that.

394
00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:13.278
When you're ready,
I want you to storm the house,

395
00:16:13.362 --> 00:16:16.031
find the victim,
and bring him to safety.

396
00:16:18.492 --> 00:16:20.327
What is that?

397
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.954
What are you doing?
I do...

398
00:16:22.037 --> 00:16:24.623
Psyching myself up.

399
00:16:30.837 --> 00:16:33.548
It's hot!
Hot!

400
00:16:46.019 --> 00:16:47.854
It's fucking hot!

401
00:16:47.938 --> 00:16:50.732
Where the fuck are you at?
Oh, God.

402
00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:53.568
Oh, fuck, I can't see shit!

403
00:16:53.652 --> 00:16:55.779
Little Kev?

404
00:16:55.862 --> 00:16:58.699
Excuse me,
are you Ron Wilcox?

405
00:16:58.782 --> 00:17:00.826
Oh, hello.
How are you?

406
00:17:00.909 --> 00:17:03.120
- Jordan King.
- We've been waiting for you.

407
00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:05.330
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

408
00:17:05.414 --> 00:17:07.207
- I've got you, little Kev.
<i>- Oh, hell no!</i>

409
00:17:07.291 --> 00:17:09.334
I'm about to save
your little beautiful black ass.

410
00:17:09.418 --> 00:17:12.087
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

411
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:13.755
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>

412
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.007
What the fuck?

413
00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:16.883
Who is this?
<i>- Help! Help me!</i>

414
00:17:16.967 --> 00:17:19.511
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>
- What the...

415
00:17:19.594 --> 00:17:22.931
<i>Help! Help me!
Oh, hell no!</i>

416
00:17:23.015 --> 00:17:24.725
It's fucking hot!

417
00:17:24.808 --> 00:17:26.018
Get your ass up.

418
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:28.520
Yeah, um,
I'm just so nervous.

419
00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:30.897
I've never been in
an action movie before.

420
00:17:30.981 --> 00:17:32.524
I just wanna bring
my A-game here.

421
00:17:32.607 --> 00:17:34.693
- 90% is mental, okay?
- Oh, shit... Oh, shit!

422
00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:37.362
You are gonna be fantastic.

423
00:17:37.446 --> 00:17:39.906
I just know it.
- Oh, shit.

424
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:42.075
Is he okay?
- Oh, God.

425
00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:44.202
You leave this guy alone
for five seconds.

426
00:17:44.286 --> 00:17:45.537
Geez.
- Put me out! Put me out!

427
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.165
Put me out! Put me out!
Put me out!

428
00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.545
- Is he okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

429
00:17:53.628 --> 00:17:55.213
Gal Gadot was training with me,

430
00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:57.049
she was on fire
for twelve minutes.

431
00:17:57.132 --> 00:17:59.259
She put herself out
with a blanket.

432
00:17:59.343 --> 00:18:01.887
He barely lasted
twelve seconds.

433
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.638
Is this funny to you?

434
00:18:03.722 --> 00:18:06.767
Hey, a leading man must learn
not to sweat the small stuff.

435
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.610
What are you talking about
the small stuff?

436
00:18:08.685 --> 00:18:10.520
I was on fucking fire,
Coach Ron!

437
00:18:10.604 --> 00:18:12.022
Hey, knock it off!

438
00:18:12.105 --> 00:18:14.399
There's a lady present,
and I want you to meet her.

439
00:18:14.483 --> 00:18:16.651
Agent Hart,
this is Agent Jordan King.

440
00:18:16.735 --> 00:18:17.778
She'll be your bunkmate.

441
00:18:17.861 --> 00:18:19.404
It is a pleasure
to meet you.

442
00:18:19.488 --> 00:18:21.049
My pleasure.
Okay, you wanna explain to me

443
00:18:21.073 --> 00:18:22.866
why she get
this nice introduction?

444
00:18:22.949 --> 00:18:24.719
Why isn't she getting
hit in the head with a bat?

445
00:18:24.743 --> 00:18:26.411
When are you gonna bop her?
- Excuse me?

446
00:18:26.495 --> 00:18:28.789
Okay, you know, just...

447
00:18:28.872 --> 00:18:31.166
When he does this kind of thing,
I just zone him out.

448
00:18:31.249 --> 00:18:33.311
When he starts to whine.
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

449
00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:35.462
Okay.

450
00:18:35.545 --> 00:18:37.231
Now, this used to be
a slaughterhouse years ago,

451
00:18:37.255 --> 00:18:38.632
up until the 70's...

452
00:18:43.553 --> 00:18:45.389
...which brings me
to rule number two.

453
00:18:45.472 --> 00:18:48.308
There'll be no sexual
intercourse on the premises.

454
00:18:48.392 --> 00:18:52.687
Uh, yeah, um,
that won't be a problem.

455
00:18:55.148 --> 00:18:57.401
I didn't think it would be.

456
00:18:57.484 --> 00:19:01.196
I know you have to say it.
I-It's fine, we're good.

457
00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:03.115
All right.
So, hey, take a beat, okay?

458
00:19:03.198 --> 00:19:05.242
Relax, and we'll see you
out in twenty

459
00:19:05.325 --> 00:19:07.619
on the training ground, okay?

460
00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.037
Thanks, Ron.
You're the best.

461
00:19:09.121 --> 00:19:12.165
Hey, it's a pleasure.

462
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.380
He's a fucking sociopath.

463
00:19:18.463 --> 00:19:21.091
- How do you mean?
- How do I mean?

464
00:19:21.174 --> 00:19:22.676
Do you really wanna know
how I mean?

465
00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:23.778
Because I was here
a couple days ago

466
00:19:23.802 --> 00:19:25.137
and shit hit the fan.

467
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.614
There was a guy in here
accusing him

468
00:19:26.638 --> 00:19:28.849
of murdering some dude
named Rodrigo.

469
00:19:28.932 --> 00:19:30.684
- Rodrigo?
- Yes, Rodrigo.

470
00:19:30.767 --> 00:19:31.768
Saw a whole thing.

471
00:19:31.852 --> 00:19:33.121
And when I first
walked in this bitch,

472
00:19:33.145 --> 00:19:34.771
they hit me in the head
with a bat.

473
00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:37.357
Not no plastic bat.
With a fucking metal bat!

474
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:40.026
And today, today he let me
catch myself on fire!

475
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.654
"Let me catch
myself on fire"?

476
00:19:42.737 --> 00:19:43.965
I don't know why
you gotta sound it out.

477
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:47.200
Yes. Let me catch...
no, I see why you did that.

478
00:19:47.284 --> 00:19:48.660
Because if you slow it down,

479
00:19:48.743 --> 00:19:49.578
you slow down,
it don't sound right.

480
00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:50.996
But you get what I'm saying.

481
00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:53.373
It happened.
It fucking happened.

482
00:19:53.457 --> 00:19:54.624
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

483
00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:56.251
It's just,
I don't have my phone,

484
00:19:56.334 --> 00:19:58.211
it's weird in here,

485
00:19:58.295 --> 00:19:59.480
and stuff is just starting to
fuck with me.

486
00:19:59.504 --> 00:20:02.215
Maybe-maybe I'm going
a little stir crazy.

487
00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:04.551
I don't know.

488
00:20:04.634 --> 00:20:08.555
That's shit.
That's shit water.

489
00:20:08.638 --> 00:20:10.682
Yep, God damn.

490
00:20:10.765 --> 00:20:14.436
Well, you're
not alone anymore, so...

491
00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:20.233
Yeah, well, maybe, but...
Hey, do I know you?

492
00:20:20.317 --> 00:20:23.528
Oh.

493
00:20:23.612 --> 00:20:26.490
I do!
Fuck!

494
00:20:26.573 --> 00:20:28.783
You're the girl from
that sitcom with the robot.

495
00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:30.136
The robot that was
a butler, right?

496
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.262
You used to argue
with the butler,

497
00:20:31.286 --> 00:20:33.246
"Uh-uh,
get the fuck out of here".

498
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.373
You'd do the thing,
"Butler, bitch".

499
00:20:35.457 --> 00:20:37.501
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

500
00:20:37.584 --> 00:20:39.211
- That's me.
- Wow.

501
00:20:39.294 --> 00:20:42.506
Well, was.
I just quit.

502
00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:45.258
Kathryn Bigelow offered me
the lead in her next movie,

503
00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:48.136
which is huge, since there are,
like, what,

504
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.680
three total action roles
for women?

505
00:20:50.764 --> 00:20:52.349
Oh, it's a lot
more than that.

506
00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:55.310
But congrats.

507
00:20:55.393 --> 00:20:58.522
Are you... I mean,
you want me to name 'em?

508
00:20:58.605 --> 00:21:00.645
I can go down the list.
You got Wonder Woman, right?

509
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.150
You know, the Black Widow.

510
00:21:02.234 --> 00:21:07.072
You got, um, what was the one
with the woman with the, uh...

511
00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:11.201
she's, uh... what's...
that's three.

512
00:21:11.284 --> 00:21:15.539
Anyway, um, it's all riding on
this action school.

513
00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:17.707
I've just gotta prove to Ron
that I've got the chops,

514
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:18.959
that I'm fit enough.

515
00:21:19.042 --> 00:21:20.877
You ain't gotta
prove that to nobody.

516
00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:23.046
You are fit.

517
00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:26.716
When you walked in that door
I said, "God damn."

518
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.677
Not like that.

519
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.596
I'm not saying it like that.
I don't mean it that way.

520
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.040
- I'm just here to train...
- Yeah.

521
00:21:33.098 --> 00:21:36.101
...not make friends.
So, just to be clear.

522
00:21:36.184 --> 00:21:38.436
We're-we're here for
the same thing, right?

523
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.604
Fuck friendship.
- Good.

524
00:21:39.688 --> 00:21:42.482
Yeah.

525
00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:44.646
- Mind if I use the bathroom?
- Do what you gotta do.

526
00:21:44.693 --> 00:21:46.194
The bathroom right there.

527
00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:49.739
Yeah, I'm gonna
need you to just...

528
00:21:49.823 --> 00:21:53.743
Oh. You gotta shit.

529
00:21:56.329 --> 00:21:58.748
Now in this lesson,
we're going to focus

530
00:21:58.832 --> 00:22:02.377
and explore the action star's
motivations.

531
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.754
Agent King,
what is your motivation?

532
00:22:04.838 --> 00:22:06.506
After working undercover
in Paris,

533
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.383
I go down to the basement
of the Louvre,

534
00:22:08.466 --> 00:22:11.344
where I thwart the theft of
an ancient Egyptian artifact

535
00:22:11.428 --> 00:22:13.597
when I'm accosted by
a rogue agent.

536
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.057
- Good, Agent Hart.
- Accost?

537
00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:17.201
That's a little strong,
isn't it?

538
00:22:17.225 --> 00:22:21.313
What the fuck?
Focus. Focus.

539
00:22:21.396 --> 00:22:24.107
And...

540
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:26.026
Okay, all right.
I-I'm an agent.

541
00:22:26.109 --> 00:22:28.737
- Yes.
- I'm an agent, and, um,

542
00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.698
basically, I gotta-I gotta
go get Agent King.

543
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:34.618
I gotta seduce...
I gotta seduce Agent King

544
00:22:34.701 --> 00:22:36.161
in the basement of the Louvre.

545
00:22:36.244 --> 00:22:37.954
And just a question,
is this, like,

546
00:22:38.038 --> 00:22:40.915
some James Bond fan fiction?
- And, action.

547
00:22:49.132 --> 00:22:51.801
Agent King?

548
00:22:51.885 --> 00:22:55.013
- Who wants to know?
- Agent Hart.

549
00:22:55.096 --> 00:22:57.432
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

550
00:22:57.515 --> 00:22:59.351
Not so fast.

551
00:22:59.434 --> 00:23:01.895
Look, you're in great danger,

552
00:23:01.978 --> 00:23:05.190
and the only cure for it
is to come with me to my bed.

553
00:23:10.612 --> 00:23:12.572
Seduce her,
god damn it!

554
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.786
Seduce her.
Lure her into the car.

555
00:23:25.085 --> 00:23:27.462
In the car.

556
00:23:27.545 --> 00:23:29.631
In my car.

557
00:23:29.714 --> 00:23:32.717
Fucking creep.

558
00:23:41.434 --> 00:23:43.162
- What the fuck was that?
- Beautiful, beautiful.

559
00:23:43.186 --> 00:23:44.562
Keep going.
Keep going.

560
00:23:44.646 --> 00:23:46.648
What the fuck you mean,
"Keep going"?

561
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:47.982
What the fuck, man?

562
00:23:48.066 --> 00:23:49.460
Do you have a problem,
Agent Hart?

563
00:23:49.484 --> 00:23:50.503
Yeah, I got a problem,
motherfucker!

564
00:23:50.527 --> 00:23:51.820
What is it?

565
00:23:51.903 --> 00:23:53.339
She's Bruce Lee,
and I'm some weird creeper.

566
00:23:53.363 --> 00:23:55.448
Oh, it's too challenging
for you to seduce her.

567
00:23:55.532 --> 00:23:57.325
Is that it?
- Uh, yes, it is.

568
00:23:57.409 --> 00:23:59.452
When you got me, looking...

569
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:05.250
I see what you're doing.

570
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:07.168
You're trying to get me
all riled up.

571
00:24:07.252 --> 00:24:08.252
It's not gonna work.

572
00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:09.921
I'm not falling for
your little trap

573
00:24:10.004 --> 00:24:10.922
and I'm not going
back over here

574
00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:12.841
to fight this
fucking jujitsu master

575
00:24:12.924 --> 00:24:14.134
with sexy talk.

576
00:24:14.217 --> 00:24:16.302
Oh, you want
a change of motivation?

577
00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:17.429
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

578
00:24:17.512 --> 00:24:19.222
This is your new motivation.

579
00:24:19.305 --> 00:24:21.891
She's a Russian mole
pretending to be an FBI agent.

580
00:24:21.975 --> 00:24:25.687
You eliminate her with this.

581
00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.023
- It's a prop knife, right?
- Retractable.

582
00:24:29.107 --> 00:24:31.693
Now go in there and
show her who's boss.

583
00:24:31.776 --> 00:24:35.155
Now we're fucking talking.

584
00:24:35.238 --> 00:24:37.407
You said
she's a Russian mole, right?

585
00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:40.326
Okay, I don't like that.
Down goes the mole, huh?

586
00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:47.667
Shit!
Oh, god damn it.

587
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:50.253
Hey, I'm about to stab you
in the side, okay?

588
00:24:50.336 --> 00:24:54.174
With...
it's a prop knife.

589
00:24:54.257 --> 00:24:55.425
What the?

590
00:24:55.508 --> 00:24:57.469
Oh, you gotta sell it.
Make it look real.

591
00:25:03.183 --> 00:25:05.477
Ah, what the fuck?

592
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.563
Ah!
- Real blood.

593
00:25:08.646 --> 00:25:11.065
- Oh, my God.
- What have you done to her?

594
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:13.526
What have you done to her?
- I'm so sorry.

595
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.490
I thought-I thought you said
it was retractable.

596
00:25:15.528 --> 00:25:17.238
I said it was practical.

597
00:25:17.322 --> 00:25:19.532
It's a practical knife!
It's a real knife!

598
00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:20.658
- Oh, my God.
- Oh God.

599
00:25:20.742 --> 00:25:22.494
She's passing out now.
- Oh, shit!

600
00:25:22.577 --> 00:25:23.596
I'm gonna have to
stitch her up.

601
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.930
I've got a medical kit
in my office.

602
00:25:24.954 --> 00:25:26.056
- Fine, I will grab it.
- No!

603
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.166
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Go to your room.

604
00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:29.250
You're grounded!
- No.

605
00:25:29.334 --> 00:25:30.168
What are you talking about?
I'll go grab it.

606
00:25:30.251 --> 00:25:32.378
No!

607
00:25:32.462 --> 00:25:35.423
My office is off limits
to students.

608
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:45.433
I said my office
is off limits.

609
00:25:45.517 --> 00:25:47.227
If you disobey me again,

610
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:49.354
the next time
I throw that knife

611
00:25:49.437 --> 00:25:51.189
will be through
your fucking skull.

612
00:26:02.408 --> 00:26:04.786
Hey.

613
00:26:04.869 --> 00:26:07.580
I brought you some breakfast
as a peace offering.

614
00:26:07.664 --> 00:26:09.207
The food here
is a little tricky.

615
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.501
It's just a closet
full of beef jerky.

616
00:26:11.584 --> 00:26:13.086
Apparently,
Macho Man Randy Savage

617
00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:16.214
was an alum here and
he left his entire food supply

618
00:26:16.297 --> 00:26:18.508
to Ron in his will, so...

619
00:26:18.591 --> 00:26:21.427
Snap into a Slim Jim?

620
00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:23.179
Care to join me
for breakfast?

621
00:26:23.263 --> 00:26:27.141
Of course.
Jerky for two.

622
00:26:27.225 --> 00:26:28.810
Hmm.

623
00:26:28.893 --> 00:26:33.022
Um, look,
I'm going to apologize.

624
00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:36.234
You know, I didn't mean to...
- Stab me?

625
00:26:36.317 --> 00:26:38.361
Well, I wasn't
gonna use those words.

626
00:26:38.444 --> 00:26:40.864
Look, Ron...
Ron is crazy.

627
00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:43.241
I'm serious.
He's-he's nuts.

628
00:26:43.324 --> 00:26:45.410
Sick in the head crazy.

629
00:26:45.493 --> 00:26:47.579
And I'm convinced that
that motherfucker

630
00:26:47.662 --> 00:26:49.497
killed a dude named Rodrigo.

631
00:26:49.581 --> 00:26:51.082
And the motherfucker
tried to kill me

632
00:26:51.165 --> 00:26:52.834
just for being
around his office.

633
00:26:52.917 --> 00:26:55.920
And as far as your arm goes,
I know you think I'm lying,

634
00:26:56.004 --> 00:26:57.630
I heard retractable.

635
00:26:57.714 --> 00:26:59.757
You know, I've dated
guys like you before.

636
00:26:59.841 --> 00:27:02.093
It's always
someone else's fault.

637
00:27:02.176 --> 00:27:03.678
That's not true.

638
00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:05.889
That's not true at all.
When I'm wrong, I...

639
00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:07.366
I shouldn't say that,
'cause I'm never wrong.

640
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.058
If... If I'm wrong,

641
00:27:09.142 --> 00:27:11.352
I have no problem admitting
that I'm wrong.

642
00:27:11.436 --> 00:27:15.356
But in this case, I'm not.
He said "retractable."

643
00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.776
Hey, part of me
is glad you stabbed me.

644
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.987
It's a badge of honor.

645
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.448
I heard when Jason Statham
came through here,

646
00:27:23.531 --> 00:27:25.909
he got stabbed
directly in the heart.

647
00:27:25.992 --> 00:27:26.993
Did he survive that?

648
00:27:27.076 --> 00:27:29.162
He shot "Transporter"
like a week later.

649
00:27:29.245 --> 00:27:31.706
What the fuck?
In the heart?

650
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:33.142
They stabbed him in the heart?
- Yup, right through it.

651
00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:34.709
God damn it.

652
00:27:34.792 --> 00:27:37.045
Maybe I'm just doing
the wrong fucking thing here.

653
00:27:37.128 --> 00:27:41.758
I mean, maybe this just
isn't for me, you know?

654
00:27:41.841 --> 00:27:44.636
So just leave.
Go home.

655
00:27:44.719 --> 00:27:46.512
I'm sure
there's a real hero somewhere

656
00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:49.682
in need of a goofy sidekick.
- Okay, that backfired.

657
00:27:49.766 --> 00:27:51.327
I thought that you would
go the opposite direction

658
00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:53.645
and tell me that,
no, I should stay.

659
00:27:53.728 --> 00:27:55.772
And that this is for me.

660
00:27:55.855 --> 00:27:57.732
That's what I thought.

661
00:27:57.815 --> 00:27:59.126
Well what do you
want me to say?

662
00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:01.486
If you need extra motivation
to be the star

663
00:28:01.569 --> 00:28:06.115
of a Claude Van De Velde movie,
you're in the wrong business.

664
00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:09.452
This is probably my only shot
to be a big action star,

665
00:28:09.535 --> 00:28:12.080
so I'm not gonna blow it.

666
00:28:12.163 --> 00:28:14.666
I'll do anything it takes.

667
00:28:17.502 --> 00:28:19.837
You're right.

668
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:23.216
You are absolutely right.

669
00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:25.301
I need to stop
all the bitching and moaning.

670
00:28:25.385 --> 00:28:27.470
I need to cowboy the fuck up.

671
00:28:27.553 --> 00:28:30.723
There you go.

672
00:28:34.268 --> 00:28:35.853
When I first started
in the business

673
00:28:35.937 --> 00:28:37.563
training action stars,

674
00:28:37.647 --> 00:28:40.066
every stunt scene was practical,

675
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:43.236
or as Kevin might say,
retractable.

676
00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:45.238
Oh, that's really good.
That's great.

677
00:28:45.321 --> 00:28:46.197
It's not funny.

678
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.466
But the industry
has changed.

679
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.950
You can't even be
an action star

680
00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:51.452
without, well,
knowing how to work green.

681
00:28:51.536 --> 00:28:54.122
I'm very familiar
with a green screen.

682
00:28:54.205 --> 00:28:55.707
I mean, I've done about
15 movies

683
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.250
where we've had a green screen.

684
00:28:57.333 --> 00:28:59.919
In which of those 15 movies
were you the leading man?

685
00:29:00.003 --> 00:29:01.921
Any idiot can jump
on a green screen

686
00:29:02.005 --> 00:29:04.799
and pretend to be eaten by
a CG dragon.

687
00:29:04.882 --> 00:29:06.718
Hell, even little Kevin
can do that.

688
00:29:06.801 --> 00:29:08.094
<i>Oh, hell no!</i>

689
00:29:08.177 --> 00:29:10.847
Okay, who's finding the time
to dress him like me?

690
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.098
It's really...

691
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:14.017
Okay, question,
what does a leading woman,

692
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.894
or leading man,
get to do onscreen

693
00:29:16.978 --> 00:29:19.188
that sidekicks don't?
- Win fights.

694
00:29:19.272 --> 00:29:22.400
- Murder bad guys.
- Make love.

695
00:29:22.483 --> 00:29:25.028
Today's lesson
is in love making.

696
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:27.613
Yes!
On the green screen.

697
00:29:27.697 --> 00:29:29.240
Are we doing it
on the green screen?

698
00:29:29.323 --> 00:29:30.783
- Bingo.
- Nice.

699
00:29:30.867 --> 00:29:33.536
Adding effects to the bed,
to the walls, cracking 'em.

700
00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:34.912
Okay, I'm gonna be candid,

701
00:29:34.996 --> 00:29:37.540
I don't want to do
a sex scene with him.

702
00:29:37.623 --> 00:29:38.791
That's fine,

703
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:39.709
'cause I don't wanna do
a sex scene with her.

704
00:29:39.834 --> 00:29:41.878
Ugh.

705
00:29:45.882 --> 00:29:47.216
What's so funny?

706
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.802
Okay, well, look at you,
and then look at her.

707
00:29:49.886 --> 00:29:53.056
And look at you, then her.
Then you, then her.

708
00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:54.307
Okay, I don't get the joke.

709
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.641
What is it?
What am I missing?

710
00:29:55.725 --> 00:29:57.077
All right,
let me put it another way.

711
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.646
Uh, look at you,
and then look at her.

712
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:02.148
Then look at you,
and then her.

713
00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:05.234
Can we just get this shit
over with, please?

714
00:30:05.318 --> 00:30:07.695
Okay, let's discuss
motivation.

715
00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:11.115
All right, now, after
almost killing each other,

716
00:30:11.199 --> 00:30:13.159
Agent Hart and Agent King

717
00:30:13.242 --> 00:30:15.203
discover that they're
on the same team.

718
00:30:15.286 --> 00:30:18.247
After defusing a bomb
at the top of a skyscraper

719
00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:20.792
in-in the middle of
an earthquake,

720
00:30:20.875 --> 00:30:23.336
you discover
this overwhelming passion

721
00:30:23.419 --> 00:30:25.379
for each other.

722
00:30:26.214 --> 00:30:27.340
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

723
00:30:27.423 --> 00:30:28.663
We're at the top
of a skyscraper

724
00:30:28.716 --> 00:30:29.550
in the middle
of an earthquake?

725
00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:31.719
Yes! Yes! Goddamn it!

726
00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:33.963
You are the dumbest actor
that I have ever worked with.

727
00:30:34.013 --> 00:30:35.765
Go! Action!

728
00:30:37.517 --> 00:30:39.268
Red wire or blue wire?

729
00:30:39.352 --> 00:30:40.603
It's gotta be the red.

730
00:30:40.686 --> 00:30:41.687
Are you sure?

731
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:44.232
Agent Hart, are you sure?
- I don't know.

732
00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:11.968
Earthquake! Earthquake!

733
00:31:12.051 --> 00:31:13.344
The building's falling apart!

734
00:31:13.427 --> 00:31:15.596
- Oh, uh, Okay, um...
- Okay.

735
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.557
Good... great.

736
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.100
Oh! Oh! Oh!

737
00:31:19.183 --> 00:31:21.561
Oh! Shit!
Hold on.

738
00:31:21.644 --> 00:31:23.479
Wait... Oh.

739
00:31:23.563 --> 00:31:24.998
Where you at?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

740
00:31:25.022 --> 00:31:26.023
- Kevin.
- Hold on, wait!

741
00:31:26.107 --> 00:31:27.608
Give me a second.
Shit!

742
00:31:27.692 --> 00:31:28.943
- Okay.
- Okay.

743
00:31:29.026 --> 00:31:30.546
All right, come on.
It's an earthquake.

744
00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:31.612
It's an earthquake, fuck.

745
00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:33.281
- Yeah.
- Go.

746
00:31:33.364 --> 00:31:36.159
Agent Hart, I can't believe
we just diffused that bomb.

747
00:31:36.242 --> 00:31:38.452
We just saved thousands
of lives, maybe millions.

748
00:31:38.536 --> 00:31:42.123
This earthquake's gotta be
about a 7.5 magnitude.

749
00:31:42.206 --> 00:31:45.751
This could be our last time
being together before we die.

750
00:31:45.835 --> 00:31:48.838
Now kiss her neck softly
and start fucking.

751
00:31:48.921 --> 00:31:50.631
What? Wait.

752
00:31:50.715 --> 00:31:52.383
Kiss-kiss her neck
and then start fucking?

753
00:31:52.466 --> 00:31:54.844
Kiss her neck softly
and start fucking!

754
00:31:54.927 --> 00:31:57.305
Oh, okay.

755
00:31:57.388 --> 00:31:58.740
I'm just gonna do it,
'cause that's what he's...

756
00:31:58.764 --> 00:32:00.016
Yeah, no, it's fine.

757
00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:01.893
Yeah, put your...
Give me that.

758
00:32:01.976 --> 00:32:04.103
Be sexy!
Do something!

759
00:32:04.187 --> 00:32:05.664
- Grab my leg.
- Yeah, give me this one.

760
00:32:05.688 --> 00:32:07.565
Have you never
had sex before?

761
00:32:07.648 --> 00:32:08.900
Do it!

762
00:32:08.983 --> 00:32:10.502
- That's not...
- We need to be upright.

763
00:32:10.526 --> 00:32:11.587
One second, that's it.
- Give me that.

764
00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:13.279
Go! Go!

765
00:32:13.362 --> 00:32:16.407
Agent Hart, no.
We shouldn't do this.

766
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.410
It's against Bureau
protocol.

767
00:32:19.493 --> 00:32:21.871
Well, protocol was
meant to be broken.

768
00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:27.418
Ah, whoa!
Ah, help!

769
00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:29.337
Help! Don't drop me!
Don't drop me!

770
00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.838
Please don't let go!
Don't let go!

771
00:32:30.922 --> 00:32:32.089
I won't, I've got you.

772
00:32:32.173 --> 00:32:34.425
- Don't let go!
- I've got you, I promise.

773
00:32:34.508 --> 00:32:36.510
Can you push in
a little closer?

774
00:32:36.594 --> 00:32:38.346
Help me! Help me!

775
00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:39.847
I'm too young to die.

776
00:32:39.931 --> 00:32:41.933
Any closer, they'll
see the cameras.

777
00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:43.851
Okay, good, hold there.

778
00:32:43.935 --> 00:32:45.645
- I got you.
- Perfect.

779
00:32:45.728 --> 00:32:47.104
- Help!
- Kevin,

780
00:32:47.188 --> 00:32:48.981
you're like one foot
off the ground.

781
00:32:49.065 --> 00:32:51.234
You cannot teach
acting like that.

782
00:32:51.317 --> 00:32:52.794
I'm just gonna
let you down, okay?

783
00:32:52.818 --> 00:32:54.237
Ah!

784
00:32:58.699 --> 00:33:00.910
Okay, lights out,
twenty minutes.

785
00:33:00.993 --> 00:33:02.912
No funny business.

786
00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:04.789
And no fucking!

787
00:33:13.005 --> 00:33:14.340
Now do you believe me?

788
00:33:14.423 --> 00:33:16.801
He's a fucking psychopath.

789
00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:19.095
Okay, it does seem like
an odd coincidence

790
00:33:19.178 --> 00:33:20.763
your wires just snapped.

791
00:33:20.846 --> 00:33:22.807
Coincidence?

792
00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:26.060
Those lines are strong enough
to hold a goddamn elephant.

793
00:33:26.143 --> 00:33:28.271
Where's your phone at?
- He confiscated it.

794
00:33:44.328 --> 00:33:47.331
Kevin, he said lights out.
We can't leave.

795
00:33:47.415 --> 00:33:48.916
He's not
my camp counselor.

796
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.126
You know what I'm gonna do?

797
00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:52.545
I'm about to go, I'm about
to get my phone back,

798
00:33:52.628 --> 00:33:53.981
and I'mma see what other
weird shit he hide

799
00:33:54.005 --> 00:33:57.133
in this office that
he don't want me to see.

800
00:33:57.216 --> 00:33:59.427
Kevin, don't.

801
00:34:23.826 --> 00:34:25.161
- Claude.
- Ronny, baby!

802
00:34:25.244 --> 00:34:27.705
Garçon.

803
00:34:27.788 --> 00:34:30.833
- Have a seat.
- Ah.

804
00:34:30.916 --> 00:34:34.462
Uh, pull up
scene 12, please.

805
00:34:34.545 --> 00:34:36.088
Have a seat.

806
00:34:37.882 --> 00:34:40.551
- This is a bad idea.
- This is a good idea.

807
00:34:40.634 --> 00:34:42.845
Wilcox won't murder me
in front of you.

808
00:34:42.928 --> 00:34:44.805
Come on, there's his office.
Come on.

809
00:34:46.766 --> 00:34:48.976
Shit!

810
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.020
Do you have a bobby pin?

811
00:34:51.103 --> 00:34:52.313
Yeah, yeah,

812
00:34:52.396 --> 00:34:54.207
it's in the bun on the back
of my fucking head.

813
00:34:54.231 --> 00:34:56.067
Okay, don't be an asshole.

814
00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:58.152
I'll find a paperclip.
Excuse me.

815
00:35:00.154 --> 00:35:01.739
Wait, you know how
to pick a lock?

816
00:35:01.822 --> 00:35:04.033
South side of Chicago,
born and raised.

817
00:35:04.116 --> 00:35:05.302
It's not North Philadelphia,

818
00:35:05.326 --> 00:35:07.453
but I'm not gonna
hold it against you.

819
00:35:07.536 --> 00:35:09.497
- Got it.
- Hey.

820
00:35:15.336 --> 00:35:19.048
Oh, God!
Oh, fuck, I can't see shit.

821
00:35:19.131 --> 00:35:20.925
Where you at?

822
00:35:21.008 --> 00:35:22.760
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

823
00:35:22.843 --> 00:35:24.929
- I've got you, little Kev.
<i>- Oh, hell no!</i>

824
00:35:25.012 --> 00:35:26.931
<i>Help!</i>

825
00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:29.058
It's fucking hot!

826
00:35:29.141 --> 00:35:32.103
Oh, whoa.

827
00:35:32.186 --> 00:35:35.314
You damn right.
It is authentic.

828
00:35:35.398 --> 00:35:36.750
He doesn't even know
he's being filmed.

829
00:35:36.774 --> 00:35:38.192
Exactly.

830
00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:41.612
I've been chasing for
this cinema verite style

831
00:35:41.695 --> 00:35:45.366
of realistic hard action
filmmaking for years.

832
00:35:45.449 --> 00:35:48.202
It is my white whale,
my unicorn.

833
00:35:48.285 --> 00:35:50.871
All I needed was an actor
who was fragile,

834
00:35:50.955 --> 00:35:54.291
vulnerable, afraid
of being forgotten.

835
00:35:56.794 --> 00:35:59.296
Afraid of being forgotten.

836
00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.800
Thank you, Kevin.
You're a gift.

837
00:36:02.883 --> 00:36:05.177
Thank you, thank you.

838
00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:13.894
Any questions, uh,
for tomorrow's scenes?

839
00:36:13.978 --> 00:36:16.021
Oh, no.

840
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.735
I should get back
to the set.

841
00:36:21.819 --> 00:36:23.487
Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

842
00:36:23.571 --> 00:36:25.114
Merci.

843
00:36:28.492 --> 00:36:30.077
Again.

844
00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:36.167
Hey, can I...
can I ask you a question?

845
00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.586
- Yeah.
- So you...

846
00:36:38.669 --> 00:36:40.588
you remember earlier today
when we were shooting

847
00:36:40.671 --> 00:36:42.214
the scene on green screen,

848
00:36:42.298 --> 00:36:45.634
like-like right before
the wire snapped,

849
00:36:45.718 --> 00:36:47.136
you kind of seemed
like you was...

850
00:36:47.219 --> 00:36:49.305
like you were really
into it.

851
00:36:49.388 --> 00:36:51.390
It's called acting.

852
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.768
You acted like you
wanted to kiss me.

853
00:36:54.852 --> 00:36:56.770
Yes.

854
00:36:56.854 --> 00:36:59.356
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

855
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.941
Yeah.

856
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.703
Come on, let's go.

857
00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:15.956
The fuck.
Stealing my shit.

858
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.833
Hollywood bitch.

859
00:37:33.307 --> 00:37:34.767
You got anything?

860
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:36.560
Nope, you?

861
00:37:36.644 --> 00:37:39.271
Got a drawer
full of old head shots.

862
00:37:40.564 --> 00:37:42.107
Oh.

863
00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:43.585
"Coach Ron, you are
the bright light

864
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:45.402
"in the darkest parts
of my soul."

865
00:37:45.486 --> 00:37:47.738
What the fuck
does that mean?

866
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:48.882
We should get
out of here soon.

867
00:37:48.906 --> 00:37:50.157
No, we shouldn't.

868
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:51.343
I know there's
some stuff in here

869
00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:52.284
that he don't
want us to see.

870
00:37:52.368 --> 00:37:54.703
you just gotta
look for it.

871
00:37:54.787 --> 00:37:55.704
He probably got
one of them, like,

872
00:37:55.788 --> 00:37:58.457
secret compartments
somewhere.

873
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:00.125
Got it!

874
00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:01.794
Oh, bingo.

875
00:38:01.877 --> 00:38:03.921
Holy shit.

876
00:38:07.925 --> 00:38:10.135
Here, I got another lock
for you to pick.

877
00:38:10.219 --> 00:38:11.571
- What do you think's in there?
- Don't know.

878
00:38:11.595 --> 00:38:13.347
Some shit he don't want
nobody to find.

879
00:38:15.015 --> 00:38:16.517
Shit!

880
00:38:26.735 --> 00:38:28.404
Get your ass.

881
00:38:52.845 --> 00:38:56.640
Oh, isn't
this interesting?

882
00:38:56.724 --> 00:39:00.352
Well, I know that you're both
pretending to be asleep,

883
00:39:00.436 --> 00:39:02.021
and that's fine.

884
00:39:02.104 --> 00:39:04.398
It's probably the best acting
that either of you

885
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:06.567
will ever do
in your entire lives.

886
00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.361
Especially you, Agent Hart.

887
00:39:09.445 --> 00:39:12.197
But if I find out
that either of you

888
00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:14.825
left this bunk
without my permission,

889
00:39:14.908 --> 00:39:16.410
you'll regret the day
you ever stepped

890
00:39:16.493 --> 00:39:18.954
into Ron Wilcox
Action Star School.

891
00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.050
If you weren't fake sleeping,
you would have woken up.

892
00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:55.616
Holy shit,
that was too close.

893
00:39:55.699 --> 00:39:57.368
You're telling me.

894
00:40:17.596 --> 00:40:19.223
Kevin, come on,
open it later.

895
00:40:19.306 --> 00:40:20.825
We're supposed to be
at the sound stage.

896
00:40:20.849 --> 00:40:22.434
I'm almost there.
Wait a second.

897
00:40:26.313 --> 00:40:28.107
Shit.

898
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.900
I got it!
I got it. I got it.

899
00:40:32.194 --> 00:40:33.779
It's a necklace.

900
00:40:33.862 --> 00:40:35.531
It's got RBG.

901
00:40:35.614 --> 00:40:38.742
Oh, "R" is for Rodrigo,
that guy that he murdered.

902
00:40:38.826 --> 00:40:40.536
Jesus, Kevin,
give it a rest.

903
00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:42.055
You gotta sneak that shit
back into his office

904
00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:43.706
before he figures out
you stole it.

905
00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:45.541
Rise and shine,
let's go.

906
00:40:45.624 --> 00:40:47.876
Come on, let's go!
- Shit.

907
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.712
Put this on your side.

908
00:40:59.263 --> 00:41:00.973
All right, class.

909
00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:03.559
It's a fun day today.
It's a big day.

910
00:41:03.642 --> 00:41:06.520
Behind that door, I got
a very big surprise for you.

911
00:41:06.603 --> 00:41:08.123
We'd see daylight
for the first time?

912
00:41:08.147 --> 00:41:10.023
Nope.
Any other guesses?

913
00:41:10.107 --> 00:41:11.376
You gonna open the door up
and a panther

914
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.669
gonna come through
and maul us to death?

915
00:41:12.693 --> 00:41:14.253
Getting warmer.
You're getting warmer.

916
00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.571
Why am I getting warmer?

917
00:41:15.654 --> 00:41:17.574
Ooh, a source of protein
other than beef jerky?

918
00:41:17.614 --> 00:41:19.074
That would be great.
- Watch this.

919
00:41:19.158 --> 00:41:21.078
- Unbelievable. Please.
- Some fruit? A smoothie?

920
00:41:22.703 --> 00:41:24.997
- Josh Hartnett!
- Hey, hey, hey, buddy!

921
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.206
Ooh, ooh look out,
look out!

922
00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:27.666
Ooh.

923
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:30.085
Get off me.

924
00:41:30.169 --> 00:41:32.004
My favorite alumni.

925
00:41:32.087 --> 00:41:34.882
Class third week, April 1999.
- Oh, come on, that's...

926
00:41:34.965 --> 00:41:36.967
- Come on!
- Oh my God.

927
00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.511
Is it possible that
you're too beautiful?

928
00:41:41.138 --> 00:41:43.015
Um, yeah. You kiss...

929
00:41:43.098 --> 00:41:45.642
it kissed my, um...
you smile a lot.

930
00:41:45.726 --> 00:41:47.186
What the fuck
did you just say?

931
00:41:47.269 --> 00:41:48.270
- I...
- Kev,

932
00:41:48.353 --> 00:41:49.414
I'm so glad
you're here, man.

933
00:41:49.438 --> 00:41:50.939
This is gonna change
your life.

934
00:41:51.023 --> 00:41:52.357
I mean, when Ron finished
with me,

935
00:41:52.441 --> 00:41:53.960
I shot "Pearl Harbor",
"Black Hawk Down",

936
00:41:53.984 --> 00:41:55.235
"Hollywood Homicide".

937
00:41:55.319 --> 00:41:56.921
You should have probably
left the last one out.

938
00:41:56.945 --> 00:41:58.214
When I first came here,
I was nothing.

939
00:41:58.238 --> 00:42:00.115
I was, like, 100 pounds
soaking wet.

940
00:42:00.199 --> 00:42:02.785
By the time I was out of here,
I felt invincible.

941
00:42:02.868 --> 00:42:05.537
I felt like Academy Award
winner Matt Damon or some shit.

942
00:42:05.621 --> 00:42:07.289
You're too much.

943
00:42:07.372 --> 00:42:08.499
He's too much.

944
00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:10.959
Why don't you guys catch up,
and, Agent King?

945
00:42:11.043 --> 00:42:12.878
- Yes?
- Let's talk motivation.

946
00:42:12.961 --> 00:42:15.297
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you.

947
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.927
Kev, how's it
going so far, man?

948
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.678
It is not going good.

949
00:42:21.762 --> 00:42:23.889
This place is like a prison.
Do you hear me?

950
00:42:23.972 --> 00:42:25.849
And I think Coach Ron
is trying to kill me.

951
00:42:25.933 --> 00:42:27.994
Well, that's just his way.
Look at him, he's a teddy bear.

952
00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:29.520
He ain't no teddy bear!

953
00:42:29.603 --> 00:42:31.355
He's the complete opposite
of a teddy bear.

954
00:42:31.438 --> 00:42:32.981
And I believe he
murdered somebody.

955
00:42:33.065 --> 00:42:35.150
I think he murdered
a Colombian drug lord.

956
00:42:35.234 --> 00:42:36.610
I think he did it.

957
00:42:36.693 --> 00:42:38.153
I got a guy named
Rodrigo was here,

958
00:42:38.237 --> 00:42:40.518
and I think he murdered...
- Oh God, you crack me up, Kev.

959
00:42:43.033 --> 00:42:45.118
Oh, you're serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

960
00:42:45.202 --> 00:42:46.662
I went snooping around
in his office,

961
00:42:46.745 --> 00:42:48.747
and I think I found
a keepsake from the murder.

962
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:50.582
It was a necklace,
it's got "RBG".

963
00:42:50.666 --> 00:42:52.793
Ron murdered someone
and kept a necklace?

964
00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:54.670
Like Dexter?

965
00:42:54.753 --> 00:42:56.255
- Josh, listen to me.
- Yes?

966
00:42:56.338 --> 00:42:58.173
- We need to call the cops.
- Okay.

967
00:42:58.257 --> 00:42:59.859
We need the people from
out there to come in here.

968
00:42:59.883 --> 00:43:00.944
- Okay.
- I'm taking about the Feds,

969
00:43:00.968 --> 00:43:03.053
the DA...
- What are you whispering about?

970
00:43:03.136 --> 00:43:04.531
Nothing.
We're talking about workouts.

971
00:43:04.555 --> 00:43:05.949
We're talking
my workout, his workout.

972
00:43:05.973 --> 00:43:07.349
It's nothing much.

973
00:43:07.432 --> 00:43:08.976
How's my goddaughter?

974
00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:10.894
Oh, man, she is
growing like a weed.

975
00:43:10.978 --> 00:43:12.145
Oh, yeah?
Let me see that.

976
00:43:12.229 --> 00:43:13.414
- Goddaughter?
- Let me see that.

977
00:43:13.438 --> 00:43:15.232
Whoa-ho! Oh!
- Look at her.

978
00:43:15.315 --> 00:43:16.668
She misses her
Uncle Ronnie, though.

979
00:43:16.692 --> 00:43:18.652
Well, you tell her
that her Uncle Ronnie

980
00:43:18.735 --> 00:43:20.153
misses that little
pumpkinhead, too.

981
00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:22.823
Hey.

982
00:43:22.906 --> 00:43:25.659
Hey, why the sad face?
Are you okay?

983
00:43:25.742 --> 00:43:26.952
I'm fine, I'm fine.

984
00:43:28.954 --> 00:43:31.248
I can't find
my special necklace.

985
00:43:31.331 --> 00:43:33.709
The one that I had
custom made with RBG.

986
00:43:33.792 --> 00:43:35.544
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

987
00:43:35.627 --> 00:43:36.879
That's okay, it's okay.

988
00:43:36.962 --> 00:43:38.231
Yeah, she's my favorite
Supreme Court justice.

989
00:43:38.255 --> 00:43:40.966
I mean, I love
her dissenting opinions.

990
00:43:41.049 --> 00:43:42.801
Let me tell you something,
if I find out

991
00:43:42.885 --> 00:43:45.053
that someone stole it,
I'll kill 'em.

992
00:43:45.137 --> 00:43:46.763
I'll kill 'em!
- Hey!

993
00:43:46.847 --> 00:43:49.016
You have to think
positive thoughts.

994
00:43:49.099 --> 00:43:52.269
We're gonna find it.
It's gonna turn up soon.

995
00:43:52.352 --> 00:43:55.188
I promise you,
it's gonna turn up soon.

996
00:43:57.441 --> 00:44:00.027
Today we're doing
firearms stunts.

997
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.362
We've got Officer Hartnett,
who is a corrupt cop

998
00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:03.864
who's gone rogue,

999
00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:06.700
we've got Agent King
and Agent Hart.

1000
00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:09.411
You finally found him
in this chop shop,

1001
00:44:09.494 --> 00:44:11.455
and this is where the shootout
will take place.

1002
00:44:11.538 --> 00:44:13.123
Now, here is your gun.

1003
00:44:13.206 --> 00:44:14.291
Nice.

1004
00:44:14.374 --> 00:44:16.710
Don't you ever accept
a gun like that.

1005
00:44:16.793 --> 00:44:17.920
It's always from the back.

1006
00:44:18.003 --> 00:44:19.296
You passed it
to me frontwards.

1007
00:44:19.379 --> 00:44:21.465
That was a test.
You failed.

1008
00:44:21.548 --> 00:44:24.676
Now, these firearms
are loaded, okay?

1009
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.388
So please, be careful
how you handle them.

1010
00:44:28.472 --> 00:44:29.657
Well, we don't have
to be that careful

1011
00:44:29.681 --> 00:44:31.441
'cause there's-there's
blanks in them, right?

1012
00:44:31.516 --> 00:44:32.643
Not loaded, loaded.
Just...

1013
00:44:32.726 --> 00:44:34.561
They're blanks, correct?

1014
00:44:36.104 --> 00:44:38.607
No, Coach Ron, that's
not gonna do it for me.

1015
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.568
I need a verbal confirmation
that it's blanks in this gun.

1016
00:44:41.652 --> 00:44:42.921
- What do you think?
- Yes or no?

1017
00:44:42.945 --> 00:44:44.196
Are there blanks
in this gun?

1018
00:44:44.279 --> 00:44:46.448
Come on, Kevin.
Get your head in the game, man.

1019
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:48.343
Josh, my head's in the game.
I'm just trying to be safe.

1020
00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:51.078
And he still didn't
say yes or no.

1021
00:44:51.161 --> 00:44:52.621
Yes.

1022
00:44:52.704 --> 00:44:55.207
- Yes, you heard him.
- Okay, everyone in wardrobe.

1023
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.684
I'll see you in ten,
right back here,

1024
00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:57.834
we start the shootout.

1025
00:44:57.918 --> 00:44:59.503
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

1026
00:45:03.215 --> 00:45:05.217
Hey, what are you doing?
Get into costume.

1027
00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.760
No, not me.
I'm not doing it.

1028
00:45:06.843 --> 00:45:08.053
Kevin, you're
being paranoid.

1029
00:45:08.136 --> 00:45:09.656
We all heard him say
there were blanks.

1030
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.140
My gun has blanks,
I guarantee you that.

1031
00:45:12.224 --> 00:45:15.060
But I bet you Josh, he's got
a fully loaded fuckin' pistol.

1032
00:45:15.143 --> 00:45:16.812
Now, Ron already tried
to kill me once.

1033
00:45:16.895 --> 00:45:19.082
Right now, he's probably willing
to go all the fuckin' way.

1034
00:45:19.106 --> 00:45:20.273
I'm not doing it.

1035
00:45:20.357 --> 00:45:22.043
Trying to make it look like
a goddamn accident.

1036
00:45:22.067 --> 00:45:23.443
That's exactly
what it'll do.

1037
00:45:23.527 --> 00:45:27.656
Kevin Hart accidentally killed
in Ron Wilcox's Action School.

1038
00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:29.533
No, thank you.

1039
00:45:29.616 --> 00:45:31.284
First of all,
Josh would never do that.

1040
00:45:31.368 --> 00:45:33.578
He is sweet and sensitive.

1041
00:45:33.662 --> 00:45:36.790
And he's tender, probably.

1042
00:45:36.873 --> 00:45:38.709
Okay, what the fuck
is over there, huh?

1043
00:45:38.792 --> 00:45:40.335
I bet he's none
of those things.

1044
00:45:40.419 --> 00:45:42.546
He and Ron,
they're like this.

1045
00:45:42.629 --> 00:45:45.257
Fucking godfather to his kids.
He didn't say shit about that.

1046
00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.620
And they know
I got the necklace!

1047
00:45:46.675 --> 00:45:47.718
So put it back.

1048
00:45:47.801 --> 00:45:49.281
I can't put it back
'cause too late.

1049
00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:50.804
They know I got
the goddamn necklace.

1050
00:45:50.887 --> 00:45:52.681
You know what? It's not
safe for me here.

1051
00:45:52.764 --> 00:45:54.141
I gotta go.
- Oh,

1052
00:45:54.224 --> 00:45:55.368
so you're just gonna give up
on your lifelong dream

1053
00:45:55.392 --> 00:45:57.728
because you're afraid
of getting shot?

1054
00:45:57.811 --> 00:46:00.022
Fuck that dream!

1055
00:46:00.105 --> 00:46:02.482
And look, I'm leavin'.

1056
00:46:02.566 --> 00:46:05.861
You got a choice.

1057
00:46:05.944 --> 00:46:08.071
Come with me.

1058
00:46:08.155 --> 00:46:09.740
Uh...

1059
00:46:12.784 --> 00:46:14.536
I can't.

1060
00:46:14.619 --> 00:46:16.538
I'm sorry.

1061
00:46:16.621 --> 00:46:18.457
This is my shot.

1062
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.917
I understand.

1063
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:22.836
It is your shot
and you deserve it.

1064
00:46:28.383 --> 00:46:30.719
Okay.

1065
00:46:30.802 --> 00:46:32.304
Nice.

1066
00:46:41.646 --> 00:46:42.646
One, two, three.

1067
00:46:45.525 --> 00:46:46.651
Yes!

1068
00:46:55.702 --> 00:46:58.080
Ugh. That dick.

1069
00:47:00.957 --> 00:47:04.544
The fuck is my car?

1070
00:47:06.505 --> 00:47:08.673
You gotta be kidding me.

1071
00:47:13.053 --> 00:47:16.098
Oh, motherfucker!

1072
00:47:32.405 --> 00:47:36.284
He killed my car.
He killed my fucking car.

1073
00:47:36.368 --> 00:47:38.370
Kevin!

1074
00:47:38.453 --> 00:47:40.789
Kevin!

1075
00:47:40.872 --> 00:47:43.208
Where are you?

1076
00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:46.419
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

1077
00:47:46.503 --> 00:47:48.130
Shit.

1078
00:48:11.361 --> 00:48:14.531
Goddamn it.

1079
00:48:14.614 --> 00:48:16.575
Motherfuckin' squirrels.

1080
00:48:16.658 --> 00:48:18.785
Shit! Get your ass
outta here.

1081
00:48:18.869 --> 00:48:19.995
Shoo!

1082
00:48:20.078 --> 00:48:22.122
Go squirrel!

1083
00:48:23.582 --> 00:48:25.333
Motherfucker.

1084
00:48:25.417 --> 00:48:27.127
Better get your ass back.

1085
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:28.837
You hear me?

1086
00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:30.505
I ain't scared of you.

1087
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:32.799
You better keep it over there
before you get hurt.

1088
00:48:32.883 --> 00:48:34.068
Bring it over here,
you get what you want.

1089
00:48:34.092 --> 00:48:35.927
Shit. Shit!
Oh...

1090
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:37.220
I see you.

1091
00:48:37.304 --> 00:48:39.514
I ain't takin'
my eye off you.

1092
00:48:39.598 --> 00:48:41.933
I got ya locked in.

1093
00:48:42.017 --> 00:48:44.311
Stay back!

1094
00:48:45.937 --> 00:48:47.898
Stupid woods.

1095
00:48:53.236 --> 00:48:54.613
Oh.

1096
00:48:54.696 --> 00:48:56.156
Thank god.

1097
00:48:56.239 --> 00:48:57.657
Excuse me.

1098
00:48:57.741 --> 00:48:59.743
Excuse me, sir?

1099
00:48:59.826 --> 00:49:01.536
How ya doin', man?

1100
00:49:04.497 --> 00:49:07.250
- You know you're trespassin'.
- Yes.

1101
00:49:07.334 --> 00:49:08.960
I mean, no. No.
I didn't.

1102
00:49:09.044 --> 00:49:10.253
I do now. But I...

1103
00:49:10.337 --> 00:49:13.715
Sign posted
right over there.

1104
00:49:13.798 --> 00:49:16.176
Only got two words on it.

1105
00:49:16.259 --> 00:49:20.096
No and trespassin'.

1106
00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.848
Yep.

1107
00:49:21.932 --> 00:49:24.184
I see it now.

1108
00:49:24.267 --> 00:49:27.145
I see it now. I didn't see that
when I... when I came in.

1109
00:49:27.229 --> 00:49:29.439
The way I came in,
my back was to that.

1110
00:49:29.522 --> 00:49:30.440
So, I never caught that.

1111
00:49:30.523 --> 00:49:34.569
You're a city boy, ain't ya?

1112
00:49:34.653 --> 00:49:37.822
Well, uh, I refer to myself
as a city man,

1113
00:49:37.906 --> 00:49:40.325
not a boy.
You can say boy, man,

1114
00:49:40.408 --> 00:49:41.510
whatever you...
what do you prefer?

1115
00:49:41.534 --> 00:49:44.329
Woods ain't safe
for a city boy...

1116
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.876
much less a city man.

1117
00:49:52.337 --> 00:49:53.672
Okay.

1118
00:49:53.755 --> 00:49:55.966
I'm gonna address the
elephant in the woods.

1119
00:49:56.049 --> 00:49:58.361
This whole "Deliverance" thing
that we got goin' on right now...

1120
00:49:58.385 --> 00:50:00.637
which is great, okay?
'Cause it's workin'.

1121
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.948
So, when things are workin',
you give 'em the accolades

1122
00:50:01.972 --> 00:50:02.847
that they deserve.

1123
00:50:02.931 --> 00:50:05.308
I'm-I'm uncomfortable, sir.

1124
00:50:05.392 --> 00:50:07.352
I'm actually scared,
all right?

1125
00:50:07.435 --> 00:50:09.729
So, now that we know that,
let me help this mood

1126
00:50:09.813 --> 00:50:10.915
by just telling you
why I'm here.

1127
00:50:10.939 --> 00:50:12.941
I'm tryin' to use a phone.
You got a phone?

1128
00:50:13.024 --> 00:50:16.111
I wanna use it real quick,
and I'm outta here.

1129
00:50:19.948 --> 00:50:21.199
Two minutes.

1130
00:50:21.283 --> 00:50:22.659
No! I'm not out
of my mind.

1131
00:50:22.742 --> 00:50:24.911
As a matter of fact,
I'm very much in my mind.

1132
00:50:24.995 --> 00:50:27.181
- The dude's tryin' to kill me.
<i>- That's unfortunate.</i>

1133
00:50:27.205 --> 00:50:29.040
What do you mean?
Unfortunate?

1134
00:50:29.124 --> 00:50:31.793
Listen to me, Danny.
He's trying to kill me.

1135
00:50:31.876 --> 00:50:33.062
No, totally.

1136
00:50:33.086 --> 00:50:35.213
Kev, listen.
I've got huge news.

1137
00:50:35.297 --> 00:50:36.464
All right? Ready?

1138
00:50:36.548 --> 00:50:38.383
"Pound Pups 4."

1139
00:50:38.466 --> 00:50:43.013
"Pound Pups 4."
They want you to voice Reggie,

1140
00:50:43.096 --> 00:50:45.682
a quick-witted,
short-tempered goldendoodle

1141
00:50:45.765 --> 00:50:47.350
who craves mischief.

1142
00:50:47.434 --> 00:50:48.643
Did they ask
for me directly?

1143
00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:49.936
Yeah. Now, listen.

1144
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.272
The money's not what
you're used to making,

1145
00:50:52.355 --> 00:50:54.190
but this could be the role
that gets you back

1146
00:50:54.274 --> 00:50:57.736
in the good graces
with the comedy gods.

1147
00:50:58.903 --> 00:51:01.948
Hey, I... Uh...

1148
00:51:02.032 --> 00:51:05.035
Hey! I... Hi.

1149
00:51:05.118 --> 00:51:07.245
Hey, I'm Reggie
the goldendoodle

1150
00:51:07.329 --> 00:51:09.372
and I'm ready to
create some mischief!

1151
00:51:09.456 --> 00:51:11.249
See? You're a genius!

1152
00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:13.209
It's amazing.
I'm in the movie right now.

1153
00:51:13.293 --> 00:51:14.461
I'm watchin' the movie!

1154
00:51:15.962 --> 00:51:19.049
<i>Now, normally, we'd,
you know, counter.</i>

1155
00:51:19.132 --> 00:51:21.134
<i>Negotiate a better deal,
blah, blah, blah.</i>

1156
00:51:21.217 --> 00:51:22.927
I think we should
close this one.

1157
00:51:23.011 --> 00:51:24.512
Huh? What do you think?

1158
00:51:24.596 --> 00:51:26.264
<i>No, no, no.
Don't sigh.</i>

1159
00:51:26.348 --> 00:51:28.058
Be happy.
This is good, Kev.

1160
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:37.442
Oh, goddamn it.
Are you crying?

1161
00:51:37.525 --> 00:51:40.904
How did we get here,
Danny? Hmm?

1162
00:51:40.987 --> 00:51:42.864
How did we get here?

1163
00:51:42.947 --> 00:51:44.324
Just tell me
how we got here.

1164
00:51:44.407 --> 00:51:46.701
<i>Look. Stop beatin'
yourself up.</i>

1165
00:51:46.785 --> 00:51:49.079
Huh? You made a mistake.

1166
00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:50.514
<i>You tried to be
somethin' you're not.</i>

1167
00:51:50.538 --> 00:51:51.831
You're not an action hero.

1168
00:51:51.915 --> 00:51:54.000
You know that now.

1169
00:51:54.084 --> 00:51:55.436
<i>So, is that a yes
on "Pound Pups 4?"</i>

1170
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:56.753
I...

1171
00:51:56.836 --> 00:51:59.130
Help! Help me!

1172
00:51:59.214 --> 00:52:01.341
- I'm stuck!
<i>- Kevin?</i>

1173
00:52:01.424 --> 00:52:04.177
Kevin, I need
a verbal yes on this.

1174
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.596
Kevin, don't let
this go away, buddy.

1175
00:52:06.679 --> 00:52:08.765
- Help me!
<i>- Kev, goldendoodles.</i>

1176
00:52:08.848 --> 00:52:10.225
You love dogs, Kevin.

1177
00:52:10.308 --> 00:52:11.434
Help!

1178
00:52:11.518 --> 00:52:13.520
<i>- Kevin.</i>
- Help me!

1179
00:52:13.603 --> 00:52:15.271
Help!

1180
00:52:15.355 --> 00:52:16.940
- Hey, you okay?
- No!

1181
00:52:17.023 --> 00:52:19.734
- Fuck.
- Damn truck broke.

1182
00:52:19.818 --> 00:52:22.112
Ugh. Shit!

1183
00:52:22.195 --> 00:52:23.905
It's on my chest.

1184
00:52:23.988 --> 00:52:25.615
I can't breathe.

1185
00:52:25.698 --> 00:52:27.298
I'm gonna call
somebody right now, man.

1186
00:52:27.325 --> 00:52:30.203
Okay? I'm gonna
call someone.

1187
00:52:30.286 --> 00:52:31.788
Hey.

1188
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:33.206
Hey!

1189
00:52:33.289 --> 00:52:36.918
Oh, sh...

1190
00:52:37.001 --> 00:52:38.670
Okay. Come on.

1191
00:52:38.753 --> 00:52:40.463
You gotta lift this truck.

1192
00:52:40.547 --> 00:52:43.049
You gotta lift this truck!

1193
00:52:43.133 --> 00:52:44.884
Lift the fuckin' truck.

1194
00:52:44.968 --> 00:52:46.845
Come on, Kevin.

1195
00:52:46.928 --> 00:52:47.804
Ready.

1196
00:52:47.887 --> 00:52:50.348
Three, two, one.

1197
00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:57.147
I'm doing it!
I'm doin' it!

1198
00:53:03.987 --> 00:53:06.114
Oh.

1199
00:53:06.197 --> 00:53:07.282
You okay?

1200
00:53:07.365 --> 00:53:09.576
Breathe, man.

1201
00:53:09.659 --> 00:53:11.119
Slow down.

1202
00:53:11.202 --> 00:53:13.663
Take your time.
All right.

1203
00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:15.099
Nice and slow.
Get your breath back.

1204
00:53:15.123 --> 00:53:17.167
Oh, my god.
You just saved my life.

1205
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:19.878
- No.
- Oh, oh, yeah.

1206
00:53:19.961 --> 00:53:21.880
You're like
a real-life Rambo.

1207
00:53:27.051 --> 00:53:28.678
I guess I kinda am.

1208
00:53:28.761 --> 00:53:29.761
Oh...

1209
00:53:32.223 --> 00:53:34.893
How can I ever
repay you, sir?

1210
00:53:34.976 --> 00:53:37.687
Sir? No, man.

1211
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:39.481
Wait, you don't
know who I am?

1212
00:53:39.564 --> 00:53:42.317
You don't recognize me from
movies, TV, stand-up comedy?

1213
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.694
Uh, no?

1214
00:53:48.865 --> 00:53:51.493
The name is Hart.

1215
00:53:51.576 --> 00:53:53.286
Agent Hart.

1216
00:53:58.166 --> 00:53:59.435
Hey, you wouldn't happen
to know of a shortcut back

1217
00:53:59.459 --> 00:54:01.711
to Ron Wilcox's Action School,
would you?

1218
00:54:01.794 --> 00:54:02.921
- Wilcox Property.
- Yeah.

1219
00:54:03.004 --> 00:54:04.589
Uh, yes, Agent.

1220
00:54:04.672 --> 00:54:07.967
Uh, you can follow that path,
it'll take you right to it.

1221
00:54:08.051 --> 00:54:09.427
Okay.

1222
00:54:09.511 --> 00:54:10.613
I think I'mma go
and get on that trail

1223
00:54:10.637 --> 00:54:12.055
before the sun goes down.

1224
00:54:12.138 --> 00:54:15.058
Uh, that...
you ain't walkin'.

1225
00:54:22.732 --> 00:54:24.192
Oh, yeah.

1226
00:54:34.953 --> 00:54:36.555
<i>- How was that?
- Phenomenal.</i>

1227
00:54:36.579 --> 00:54:37.997
<i>We got it.</i>

1228
00:54:38.081 --> 00:54:40.458
All right, that's a wrap
on the creepy trailer!

1229
00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:42.043
Well done, everyone.

1230
00:55:00.395 --> 00:55:02.981
Stop!
Goddamn it, stop!

1231
00:55:03.064 --> 00:55:04.566
Motherfuckers.

1232
00:55:08.027 --> 00:55:11.030
Chitty chitty
bang bang, bitch.

1233
00:55:11.114 --> 00:55:13.533
No!

1234
00:55:13.616 --> 00:55:15.785
No!

1235
00:55:15.868 --> 00:55:18.538
Fuck!

1236
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:23.251
Holy shit, Jordan.
You weren't joking.

1237
00:55:23.334 --> 00:55:24.853
He actually thinks we're using
real bullets today.

1238
00:55:24.877 --> 00:55:26.921
Kev.

1239
00:55:27.005 --> 00:55:28.965
- You told him?
- I'm sorry, it was funny.

1240
00:55:29.048 --> 00:55:30.550
It's not fucking funny!

1241
00:55:30.633 --> 00:55:32.635
'Cause that man back there
is a lunatic.

1242
00:55:32.719 --> 00:55:34.721
You're a fucking lunatic,
Coach Ron.

1243
00:55:34.804 --> 00:55:37.140
Hey! You know what?

1244
00:55:37.223 --> 00:55:39.309
Maybe I am a lunatic.

1245
00:55:39.392 --> 00:55:41.477
Maybe I oughta
just kill ya!

1246
00:55:41.561 --> 00:55:43.688
Hey, no, Ron.
Hold up.

1247
00:55:43.771 --> 00:55:45.106
Let me kill him.

1248
00:55:45.189 --> 00:55:47.066
- Stop it.
- No. Me! Me! Me!

1249
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:50.153
Stop it. Stop!

1250
00:55:50.236 --> 00:55:51.446
You know what, assholes?

1251
00:55:51.529 --> 00:55:53.215
Y'all wanna fuckin' play,
then play. Go ahead.

1252
00:55:53.239 --> 00:55:54.239
Unload 'em all.

1253
00:55:54.282 --> 00:55:55.783
All right.
Now we're havin' fun.

1254
00:55:55.867 --> 00:55:58.786
After you.

1255
00:56:02.832 --> 00:56:05.251
Shit!

1256
00:56:05.335 --> 00:56:06.919
Holy shit.

1257
00:56:07.003 --> 00:56:09.172
Maybe there was
a bullet in there.

1258
00:56:09.255 --> 00:56:11.716
You're bad, man!

1259
00:56:11.799 --> 00:56:13.217
Motherfucker!

1260
00:56:13.301 --> 00:56:14.677
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my god.

1261
00:56:14.761 --> 00:56:16.888
Josh, stop, man.
This is bullshit!

1262
00:56:16.971 --> 00:56:18.264
You're tryin' to
fuckin' kill me!

1263
00:56:18.348 --> 00:56:21.267
What's your problem?
I already apologized to you.

1264
00:56:21.351 --> 00:56:23.519
- When? When did you apologize?
- I thought I did.

1265
00:56:23.603 --> 00:56:25.688
What, you thought
you apologized?

1266
00:56:25.772 --> 00:56:28.441
You know what, maybe I would
apologize to you

1267
00:56:28.524 --> 00:56:30.276
if you gave me back
my necklace.

1268
00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.279
There it is. There it is.

1269
00:56:33.363 --> 00:56:35.132
You know I took the necklace
so you tried to fucking kill me.

1270
00:56:35.156 --> 00:56:36.449
- Hey, hey.
- Just admit it, man!

1271
00:56:36.532 --> 00:56:37.760
Kev, Kev, Kev, Kev.
Just chill out.

1272
00:56:37.784 --> 00:56:38.701
We're all just
goofin' around.

1273
00:56:38.785 --> 00:56:39.702
We're just having
a little fun, okay?

1274
00:56:39.786 --> 00:56:41.204
Nobody got hurt.
Nobody got hurt!

1275
00:56:41.287 --> 00:56:43.039
- Oh, it was a goof.
- Yeah, just a goof.

1276
00:56:43.122 --> 00:56:44.683
Well, now that I know that,
I guess I feel better.

1277
00:56:44.707 --> 00:56:45.833
All right.

1278
00:56:45.917 --> 00:56:47.061
Did you know it was
a goof, Jordan?

1279
00:56:47.085 --> 00:56:48.753
You know what,
I don't know. Okay?

1280
00:56:48.836 --> 00:56:50.147
It was... I don't...
I don't know.

1281
00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:51.523
- You don't know.
- I'm staying out of it.

1282
00:56:51.547 --> 00:56:52.566
- Now, you're staying out of it.
- Yeah.

1283
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:53.508
You know what? Okay.
Everybody's tempers

1284
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:54.300
are a little hot
right now.

1285
00:56:54.384 --> 00:56:55.611
Maybe we could all
just take a break.

1286
00:56:55.635 --> 00:56:56.779
Maybe take five.
- Let's take a break.

1287
00:56:56.803 --> 00:56:57.821
We drink some water.
We have some beef jerky.

1288
00:56:57.845 --> 00:56:59.045
- All right. Okay.
- We just...

1289
00:56:59.097 --> 00:57:00.616
We reconvene in a bit, okay?
- I'm cool. I'm cool.

1290
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.117
- You're cool?
- I'm cool. Give... Come on.

1291
00:57:02.141 --> 00:57:02.975
- Give him a hug.
- Give me a hug, man.

1292
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:04.477
Give me a hug.
- I don't... No.

1293
00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.813
- Come on. I love you, man.
- That's beautiful, right?

1294
00:57:06.896 --> 00:57:08.648
How do you love me? How?

1295
00:57:08.731 --> 00:57:10.608
How? How does
anybody love anybody?

1296
00:57:11.818 --> 00:57:14.153
- What?
- That's profound.

1297
00:57:14.237 --> 00:57:16.739
It's a good question.

1298
00:57:16.823 --> 00:57:18.241
We're gonna
miss you, big guy.

1299
00:57:18.324 --> 00:57:20.052
- I'll miss you too, baby.
- That was a hoot!

1300
00:57:20.076 --> 00:57:24.247
Now he's lettin' us see
daytime as if we're free.

1301
00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.874
I never said you
weren't allowed to leave.

1302
00:57:26.958 --> 00:57:29.252
You got a little bit
of imagination there, buddy.

1303
00:57:29.335 --> 00:57:31.045
Well, I remember
my car used to be here

1304
00:57:31.129 --> 00:57:34.132
and now my car is
at the bottom of a ravine.

1305
00:57:34.215 --> 00:57:35.633
Guess I'm imaginin'
that, too?

1306
00:57:35.717 --> 00:57:37.885
Yeah, well, you know,
this is meth country.

1307
00:57:37.969 --> 00:57:41.389
Probably a couple of tweakers
goin' for a joyride.

1308
00:57:41.472 --> 00:57:42.515
They'll be back.
- Ah...

1309
00:57:42.598 --> 00:57:44.350
Tweakers love to drive,
I keep forgettin.

1310
00:57:44.434 --> 00:57:45.309
I thought we were
gonna be cool, baby.

1311
00:57:45.393 --> 00:57:46.811
- Yeah.
- I am cool. Cool.

1312
00:57:48.104 --> 00:57:49.397
Hey, look.

1313
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:51.149
I know this has
been tough on you.

1314
00:57:51.232 --> 00:57:53.234
You only got
a couple days left.

1315
00:57:53.317 --> 00:57:56.279
My advice, take as much wisdom
as you can from this guy.

1316
00:57:56.362 --> 00:57:57.923
And just have some fun.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1317
00:57:57.947 --> 00:58:00.241
Appreciate you, Josh.

1318
00:58:00.324 --> 00:58:02.201
See ya, Kev.

1319
00:58:02.285 --> 00:58:04.871
- I love you, man.
- I love you too, man.

1320
00:58:04.954 --> 00:58:06.289
Jordan.

1321
00:58:09.459 --> 00:58:10.585
The fuck was that?

1322
00:58:19.552 --> 00:58:22.221
Agent Hart.
I wanna tell ya somethin'.

1323
00:58:22.305 --> 00:58:24.116
I don't really feel like
dealin' with it, Coach Ron.

1324
00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.184
But look.

1325
00:58:26.267 --> 00:58:28.603
I'm sorry about
that live bullet, man.

1326
00:58:28.686 --> 00:58:30.313
I really am.

1327
00:58:30.396 --> 00:58:32.940
It's all I wanted, man.

1328
00:58:33.024 --> 00:58:34.609
All I wanted
was an apology.

1329
00:58:34.692 --> 00:58:36.611
I know.

1330
00:58:36.694 --> 00:58:40.156
You sayin' that to me makes
the world of difference.

1331
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:42.825
I'm sorry that
I accused you of...

1332
00:58:42.909 --> 00:58:46.078
of tryin' to kill me
and other people.

1333
00:58:46.162 --> 00:58:48.664
Now, give me a hug, man.
Thank you.

1334
00:58:48.748 --> 00:58:50.666
Thank you.
- Uh, guys?

1335
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:53.002
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

1336
00:59:08.476 --> 00:59:10.478
- Holy shit.
- Oh shit!

1337
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:17.360
Oh, shit!

1338
00:59:17.443 --> 00:59:18.712
- Get inside!
- What the fuck was that?

1339
00:59:18.736 --> 00:59:20.655
- Come on!
- Fuck this shit!

1340
00:59:20.738 --> 00:59:22.698
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, shit!

1341
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.745
It's a bomb!

1342
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:32.875
What the hell is happening?

1343
00:59:32.959 --> 00:59:34.669
Hey, Ron, I-I don't
know this scene.

1344
00:59:34.752 --> 00:59:35.670
Where is it
in the script?

1345
00:59:35.753 --> 00:59:37.964
It is not in
the fucking script!

1346
00:59:38.047 --> 00:59:39.399
No, no, no.
Tell me you're kidding.

1347
00:59:39.423 --> 00:59:40.967
Tell me that
was just a stunt.

1348
00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.653
That we did not just watch
Josh Hartnett explode!

1349
00:59:42.677 --> 00:59:45.847
It is not a stunt!
It is not in the script!

1350
00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:48.099
Josh Hartnett is dead!

1351
00:59:48.182 --> 00:59:51.686
Oh, god, I've fucked up.
I've fucked up!

1352
00:59:51.769 --> 00:59:53.062
What the fuck is goin' on?

1353
00:59:53.145 --> 00:59:54.772
- I can't.
- What the fuck is goin' on?

1354
00:59:54.856 --> 00:59:55.874
O-okay, Kevin.

1355
00:59:55.898 --> 00:59:57.525
Don't-Don't be mad.
Don't be mad.

1356
00:59:57.608 --> 00:59:59.610
But this whole thing,

1357
00:59:59.694 --> 01:00:01.534
aside from what just
happened to Josh Hartnett,

1358
01:00:01.571 --> 01:00:03.155
has-has been scripted.

1359
01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:04.258
What the fuck
is that accent?

1360
01:00:04.282 --> 01:00:05.658
I was acting,
I'm sorry!

1361
01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:07.869
I'm not from Chicago,
I'm from Essex!

1362
01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:10.454
Claude Van De Velde wanted you
at your most authentic,

1363
01:00:10.538 --> 01:00:13.082
so he hid a bunch
of cameras in here

1364
01:00:13.165 --> 01:00:15.167
to film us playing roles,
doing the stunts,

1365
01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:16.502
all of it.

1366
01:00:16.586 --> 01:00:18.105
But whatever just happened
wasn't part of it.

1367
01:00:18.129 --> 01:00:20.339
Which is fucking insane, Ron!
For fuck's sake!

1368
01:00:20.423 --> 01:00:21.799
For fuck's sake?

1369
01:00:21.883 --> 01:00:23.068
That's what you
wanna say to me?

1370
01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:24.677
For fuck's sake?

1371
01:00:33.352 --> 01:00:35.688
- Talk in your regular voice.
- All right.

1372
01:00:35.771 --> 01:00:38.190
No, I've lost it now.
I'm in my head!

1373
01:00:38.274 --> 01:00:40.943
Who does that?
Who does this to somebody?

1374
01:00:52.997 --> 01:00:55.333
Oh, shit. You okay?

1375
01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:59.170
Oh, god.
I'm such a fucking idiot!

1376
01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:02.048
What was I thinking?
- What the hell was that, man?

1377
01:01:02.131 --> 01:01:03.525
You want to know
what the hell is going on?

1378
01:01:03.549 --> 01:01:04.651
You're goddamn right
I wanna know what's going on.

1379
01:01:04.675 --> 01:01:06.135
I bought some drugs.

1380
01:01:06.218 --> 01:01:08.930
I sold them to the wrong people.
- What?

1381
01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:11.641
And Rodrigo got mad at me
and we got into a fight.

1382
01:01:11.724 --> 01:01:13.851
And then, I accidentally
killed him.

1383
01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:15.478
- You did kill Rodrigo.
- Yes.

1384
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:16.914
I told you
he fuckin' killed him.

1385
01:01:16.938 --> 01:01:19.315
And that necklace.
That necklace was his necklace.

1386
01:01:19.398 --> 01:01:21.233
I'm a horrible person.

1387
01:01:21.317 --> 01:01:23.402
I'm going straight
to hell.

1388
01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:25.206
You're goddamn right
you're going to hell.

1389
01:01:25.279 --> 01:01:26.614
What are you doing?
- Claude!

1390
01:01:26.697 --> 01:01:28.574
- What are you doin', Ron?
- Claude!

1391
01:01:28.658 --> 01:01:31.619
Claude, if you're watchin',
you call the cops right now.

1392
01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:33.454
You call the fuckin cops.

1393
01:01:33.537 --> 01:01:35.915
Senor Wilcox!

1394
01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:37.583
Oh, shit.

1395
01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:39.335
My nephew Rodrigo's body
washed up

1396
01:01:39.418 --> 01:01:41.837
4 miles due south
of here!

1397
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:44.674
A coincidence, no?

1398
01:01:44.757 --> 01:01:46.717
I'm gonna give you
2 minutes.

1399
01:01:46.801 --> 01:01:49.762
Exactly dos minutos
to bring your ass out here

1400
01:01:49.845 --> 01:01:51.138
and face me like a man!

1401
01:01:51.222 --> 01:01:53.724
If not, I'm gonna set fire
to the building

1402
01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:55.226
and burn you
like a chicharone.

1403
01:01:57.979 --> 01:02:00.856
- Snap out of it!
- I can't! It's over!

1404
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.525
Listen to me,
motherfucker.

1405
01:02:02.608 --> 01:02:05.194
This is why men shouldn't be
left in charge of anything!

1406
01:02:05.277 --> 01:02:07.947
My career is just now
becoming the thing

1407
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:10.992
that I have worked
my entire life towards!

1408
01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:13.452
And I'm not dying because
of you, you fucking idiot.

1409
01:02:13.536 --> 01:02:15.621
We're all gonna die!

1410
01:02:18.374 --> 01:02:20.584
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck, man?

1411
01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:22.670
Everybody gotta
calm the fuck down!

1412
01:02:22.753 --> 01:02:24.880
They're all blanks.

1413
01:02:24.964 --> 01:02:26.882
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
- Don't hit me.

1414
01:02:26.966 --> 01:02:29.093
I'm not gonna hit you.
Look.

1415
01:02:29.176 --> 01:02:32.013
When I first walked through
that door, you told me.

1416
01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.305
You said, "Kevin..."

1417
01:02:33.389 --> 01:02:35.516
You said an action hero
is not in here.

1418
01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:38.019
You said it's not in here.
- Uh-huh.

1419
01:02:38.102 --> 01:02:39.729
You said that it's here.

1420
01:02:39.812 --> 01:02:41.605
It's in your heart, man.

1421
01:02:41.689 --> 01:02:44.150
You know, clearly,
you done made some mistakes.

1422
01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.068
And one of those mistakes
involved murderin'

1423
01:02:46.152 --> 01:02:47.820
the nephew of some kind
of drug lord.

1424
01:02:47.903 --> 01:02:49.697
Oh, god.

1425
01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.365
I killed him!

1426
01:02:51.449 --> 01:02:53.534
I'm not tryin' to
fuckin' upset you, man.

1427
01:02:53.617 --> 01:02:55.745
Listen.
I know that you know.

1428
01:02:55.828 --> 01:02:59.040
I know that you know that
there's an action hero in there.

1429
01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:02.168
And I know that a true
action hero is-is-is tough.

1430
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:03.419
Is confident.

1431
01:03:03.502 --> 01:03:05.713
And they're unfazed
by the minor details

1432
01:03:05.796 --> 01:03:07.965
that disrupt
your average lay person.

1433
01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:11.385
They will take responsibility
for their shit.

1434
01:03:11.469 --> 01:03:13.763
You go out there
and you tell the truth, man.

1435
01:03:13.846 --> 01:03:15.806
Tell the fucking truth.

1436
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:18.517
Say Rodrigo's death...
say it was an accident.

1437
01:03:18.601 --> 01:03:20.770
Say it was a fucking accident.
And give 'em...

1438
01:03:20.853 --> 01:03:22.730
Give 'em this.
Here.

1439
01:03:22.813 --> 01:03:23.981
You give 'em this,

1440
01:03:24.065 --> 01:03:25.691
say you wanna make
things right.

1441
01:03:25.775 --> 01:03:26.877
- I wanna make it right.
- That's all you gotta do!

1442
01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:28.486
Say I wanna make it right.
I'm sorry.

1443
01:03:28.569 --> 01:03:29.987
I fucked up.
- I fucked up.

1444
01:03:30.071 --> 01:03:32.071
- I wanna tell the truth.
- I wanna tell the truth.

1445
01:03:32.114 --> 01:03:33.908
- That's it!
- I don't wanna make a mistake.

1446
01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:35.034
Okay, listen.

1447
01:03:35.117 --> 01:03:37.661
All you gotta do
is be the action hero

1448
01:03:37.745 --> 01:03:41.207
that you wanna see
in the world.

1449
01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:43.501
Thank you.

1450
01:03:43.584 --> 01:03:45.419
Thank you.

1451
01:03:45.503 --> 01:03:47.004
Tell the truth, man.

1452
01:03:52.718 --> 01:03:54.136
That was amazing.

1453
01:03:59.809 --> 01:04:01.143
Amigos!

1454
01:04:01.227 --> 01:04:02.269
Amigos.

1455
01:04:02.353 --> 01:04:03.771
Peace. Peace.

1456
01:04:03.854 --> 01:04:05.272
Paz.

1457
01:04:05.356 --> 01:04:06.607
Paz. Paz.

1458
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.608
Paz. Paz. Paz. Uh...

1459
01:04:07.691 --> 01:04:10.236
Shit, it's
actually working.

1460
01:04:10.319 --> 01:04:12.655
Kevin, did you just
save our lives?

1461
01:04:12.738 --> 01:04:14.990
No. I just know
that being the hero

1462
01:04:15.074 --> 01:04:17.535
means ownin' up
to your mistakes.

1463
01:04:17.618 --> 01:04:20.579
I had to learn
the same thing in my life.

1464
01:04:20.663 --> 01:04:23.541
Just glad that Ron can
learn the same thing too.

1465
01:04:27.878 --> 01:04:29.630
Shit!

1466
01:04:29.713 --> 01:04:31.132
What the fuck!

1467
01:04:48.023 --> 01:04:49.567
Is he dead?

1468
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:51.694
I mean, he took a lot
of bullets. I think so.

1469
01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:52.987
We gotta check.

1470
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:54.710
We gotta check to see
if he's still alive.

1471
01:04:58.075 --> 01:04:58.909
He's dead.
- Yeah.

1472
01:04:58.993 --> 01:04:59.869
- He's dead.
- Yeah.

1473
01:04:59.952 --> 01:05:02.621
- He's fuckin' dead.
- Okay. Okay.

1474
01:05:02.705 --> 01:05:05.249
Maybe if we just stay quiet,
they'll leave.

1475
01:05:05.332 --> 01:05:07.293
I like that plan.
Yeah. Yeah.

1476
01:05:07.376 --> 01:05:08.502
Juan. Ortiz.
Go inside.

1477
01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:10.045
If there's any witnesses,
kill them.

1478
01:05:10.129 --> 01:05:11.297
Hide!

1479
01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.423
Go!

1480
01:05:12.506 --> 01:05:13.841
Fuck.

1481
01:05:13.924 --> 01:05:15.259
Close it, close it,
close it.

1482
01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:16.343
Hold it. Hold it.

1483
01:05:22.474 --> 01:05:24.226
Hey, do we got any more
real bullets?

1484
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.686
I checked already,

1485
01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:26.937
they're blanks.

1486
01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:28.039
What do you mean
they're fucking blanks?

1487
01:05:28.063 --> 01:05:30.065
Is everything in here
a fuckin' prop?

1488
01:05:30.149 --> 01:05:31.358
What about the knife?

1489
01:05:31.442 --> 01:05:32.562
The knife
I stabbed you with?

1490
01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.403
It was retractable.
Fake blood.

1491
01:05:34.486 --> 01:05:37.990
Shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

1492
01:05:38.073 --> 01:05:39.825
Shit! Go.
Go, go, go!

1493
01:05:52.838 --> 01:05:54.048
Kevin?

1494
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:55.549
Yeah.

1495
01:05:55.633 --> 01:05:57.384
Um, if anything happens

1496
01:05:57.468 --> 01:05:59.303
and we don't
get out of here alive,

1497
01:05:59.386 --> 01:06:02.681
I just want you to know...
- Stop.

1498
01:06:02.765 --> 01:06:05.476
I love you too.

1499
01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:08.062
- Uh...
- Shit. You were gonna

1500
01:06:08.145 --> 01:06:10.231
say somethin' else,
weren't you?

1501
01:06:10.314 --> 01:06:11.625
You were gonna say it
was nice knowin' me?

1502
01:06:11.649 --> 01:06:13.234
- Yeah.
- Fuck me.

1503
01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.694
We're about to die.
You could've at least lied.

1504
01:06:15.778 --> 01:06:17.380
I mean, you've been lying
this entire week,

1505
01:06:17.404 --> 01:06:18.715
wouldn't have made
that big of a difference.

1506
01:06:18.739 --> 01:06:21.575
I'm sorry.
I was hired to play a role

1507
01:06:21.659 --> 01:06:23.244
and they paid me
a lot of money.

1508
01:06:23.327 --> 01:06:24.870
Like, a lot.

1509
01:06:24.954 --> 01:06:26.097
You're not making it
any better.

1510
01:06:26.121 --> 01:06:27.748
You're actually making it
a lot worse.

1511
01:06:27.831 --> 01:06:29.708
Shh.
Did you hear that?

1512
01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:31.168
Shit.
They're coming.

1513
01:06:31.252 --> 01:06:32.711
Play dead.
- What? No.

1514
01:06:32.795 --> 01:06:34.147
They'll walk in here,
they'll see that we're dead,

1515
01:06:34.171 --> 01:06:35.047
and then they'll leave.

1516
01:06:35.130 --> 01:06:36.340
But how-how did we die?

1517
01:06:36.423 --> 01:06:38.050
I can't hear you.
I'm dying.

1518
01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.446
What the...

1519
01:07:09.331 --> 01:07:11.542
Oy! Did you hear that?

1520
01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.127
Yeah.
I think it's Ortiz.

1521
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:16.422
Oh. Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?

1522
01:07:18.132 --> 01:07:19.883
It's not fuckin'
rocket science.

1523
01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.523
Kick me, bitch? Huh?
Kick this!

1524
01:07:38.152 --> 01:07:40.738
Kick me twice,
shame on me.

1525
01:07:45.326 --> 01:07:47.411
Kick me three times...

1526
01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:07.264
Don't look,
I'm on your fuckin' back.

1527
01:08:07.348 --> 01:08:09.183
Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

1528
01:08:16.815 --> 01:08:18.525
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1529
01:08:20.527 --> 01:08:21.527
Come on.

1530
01:08:29.036 --> 01:08:29.953
You think you can
win a gunfight

1531
01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:31.205
with a Colombian
drug lord?

1532
01:08:31.288 --> 01:08:33.457
No. We don't have guns
in England.

1533
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.851
Didn't you say you're
from North Philly?

1534
01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:37.002
What are you doing?
I can't take the gun like that.

1535
01:08:37.086 --> 01:08:39.213
Give it to me right.

1536
01:08:39.296 --> 01:08:40.714
Ron would be proud.

1537
01:08:40.798 --> 01:08:42.549
Shut up, Ron would be proud.

1538
01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:44.343
Ron would be proud.

1539
01:08:44.426 --> 01:08:45.969
Shit!

1540
01:08:46.053 --> 01:08:48.806
Go. Go, go, go.

1541
01:08:48.889 --> 01:08:51.100
Fuck, fuck, go.

1542
01:09:02.236 --> 01:09:04.822
Okay. I'm going
to create a distraction,

1543
01:09:04.905 --> 01:09:06.657
and then you're going
to shoot the guy.

1544
01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:07.658
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?

1545
01:09:07.741 --> 01:09:09.660
I've never been
more ready in my life.

1546
01:09:09.743 --> 01:09:12.371
On three.
One, two...

1547
01:09:12.454 --> 01:09:13.973
Wait, wait, wait.
No, don't count like that.

1548
01:09:13.997 --> 01:09:17.126
Go the other way. Three, two...
Like that does better for me.

1549
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:20.796
Three, two, one.

1550
01:09:20.879 --> 01:09:22.506
Go, go, go.

1551
01:09:22.589 --> 01:09:23.589
It's go-time.

1552
01:09:25.259 --> 01:09:27.386
Yeah, motherfucker!

1553
01:09:27.469 --> 01:09:29.054
Yeah, motherfucker!

1554
01:09:30.848 --> 01:09:32.266
God damn!

1555
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:33.642
Motherfucking prop!

1556
01:09:33.725 --> 01:09:35.185
I'm out! I'm out!
I'm out!

1557
01:09:37.438 --> 01:09:39.731
Fuck!
Almost got him.

1558
01:09:39.815 --> 01:09:41.567
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

1559
01:09:44.528 --> 01:09:46.113
Okay, he's reloading.

1560
01:09:46.196 --> 01:09:47.281
Follow me. Quick.
- Okay.

1561
01:09:47.364 --> 01:09:49.658
Wait, wait. Wait for me!
Wait for me!

1562
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.037
Damn it.

1563
01:09:54.121 --> 01:09:55.873
Can't believe
I missed his ass.

1564
01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:58.375
I had him. The sight.
It's gotta be the sight.

1565
01:09:58.459 --> 01:09:59.686
The sight is off with this.
- No, Kevin.

1566
01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:01.753
You just can't shoot for shit.
We need to think!

1567
01:10:01.837 --> 01:10:04.631
There has to be something
in here we can use.

1568
01:10:04.715 --> 01:10:07.468
Guess what we can't use? This.
It's out of bullets.

1569
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.886
I ain't got
no more bullets.

1570
01:10:08.969 --> 01:10:10.471
Kevin! Focus.

1571
01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:11.763
It's props.

1572
01:10:11.847 --> 01:10:13.891
It's a bunch of fuckin'
props over here.

1573
01:10:20.772 --> 01:10:22.816
Whoop, there it is.

1574
01:11:05.943 --> 01:11:08.779
<i>Hell no!
Oh, hell no!</i>

1575
01:11:08.862 --> 01:11:11.949
<i>Oh hell no! No-no-no...</i>

1576
01:11:12.032 --> 01:11:13.492
Got you,
motherfucker!

1577
01:11:15.577 --> 01:11:16.577
Oh shit!

1578
01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:20.457
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

1579
01:11:23.085 --> 01:11:24.085
Hold his ass.

1580
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.802
Oh, you thought it
was over, didn't you?

1581
01:11:31.885 --> 01:11:33.554
But I don't
travel alone.

1582
01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:36.014
No, I got my friends
with me.

1583
01:11:36.098 --> 01:11:39.810
Let me introduce you to
Mr. Fuck Shit and Mr. Up.

1584
01:11:39.893 --> 01:11:42.312
- Kevin, shut up!
- Okay. No, no, I was...

1585
01:11:42.396 --> 01:11:43.522
I had more,
but I can cut it.

1586
01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:44.815
Hold this motherfucker.

1587
01:11:46.733 --> 01:11:49.611
Shit! I thought
you had his feet!

1588
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:56.243
Shit! Yeah.
We got his ass.

1589
01:11:56.326 --> 01:11:57.786
I got him.

1590
01:11:57.869 --> 01:12:00.289
Ain't no "I" in "team."
Put it up here.

1591
01:12:00.372 --> 01:12:01.832
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

1592
01:12:01.915 --> 01:12:04.835
Watch your step.
Watch your step. Let's go.

1593
01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:06.396
He kicked me right in
the fucking nose,

1594
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.588
son of a bitch.

1595
01:12:13.385 --> 01:12:15.304
Run! Run.

1596
01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:26.273
Hey, wait a minute,
Jordan.

1597
01:12:26.356 --> 01:12:27.816
Jordan, slow down.
It's a cliff.

1598
01:12:27.899 --> 01:12:29.276
It's a cliff!
It's a cliff!

1599
01:12:34.406 --> 01:12:35.406
Oh, shit.

1600
01:12:37.242 --> 01:12:38.660
Come on, we've got to go.

1601
01:12:38.744 --> 01:12:41.663
I can't! I can't do that.
That's too far.

1602
01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:44.416
I'm sorry.
- Jesus Christ, just jump.

1603
01:12:44.499 --> 01:12:46.918
- Just go. Go save yourself!
- No!

1604
01:12:47.002 --> 01:12:49.630
We're both getting out of here.
Now, hurry the fuck up!

1605
01:12:52.507 --> 01:12:56.803
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

1606
01:12:56.887 --> 01:12:57.887
Fuck!

1607
01:13:01.308 --> 01:13:02.768
Go. Go. Go.

1608
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:03.851
Shit.

1609
01:13:08.565 --> 01:13:10.692
Why didn't you say
you love me back?

1610
01:13:10.776 --> 01:13:14.488
Uh, I dunno.
We just...

1611
01:13:14.571 --> 01:13:16.466
We're just kinda getting
to know each other and...

1612
01:13:25.499 --> 01:13:29.044
Any last words
before I blow your brains out?

1613
01:13:29.127 --> 01:13:31.463
Don't shoot me, okay?

1614
01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:33.924
You ain't gotta
do this.

1615
01:13:34.007 --> 01:13:35.342
You ain't gotta
do this, man.

1616
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:43.225
Yeah. Just let me...

1617
01:13:45.894 --> 01:13:48.522
Why are you doing that?

1618
01:13:48.605 --> 01:13:51.692
Cut it out.
Stop it!

1619
01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:53.777
You look at me
when I kill you.

1620
01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.903
Look at me!

1621
01:13:54.986 --> 01:13:56.863
I know that there's
nothing up there.

1622
01:14:29.938 --> 01:14:32.190
Ah, shit!

1623
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:40.115
Go home. I'm sure there's
a real hero somewhere

1624
01:14:40.198 --> 01:14:41.533
in need of
a goofy sidekick.

1625
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.412
Well, you're not
alone anymore.

1626
01:14:51.209 --> 01:14:53.754
I've got you,
I promise!

1627
01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:55.422
Kevin!

1628
01:14:55.505 --> 01:14:57.299
Focus.

1629
01:15:11.354 --> 01:15:13.398
I owe you one.

1630
01:15:20.906 --> 01:15:23.116
I'm comin' for you.

1631
01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.409
I'm comin'.

1632
01:15:28.705 --> 01:15:31.124
It's a simple jump.

1633
01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:34.169
Three, two, one.

1634
01:15:44.221 --> 01:15:47.098
Hey.
Hey, come on.

1635
01:15:47.182 --> 01:15:49.267
Jordan, no.
Come on, get up. Get up.

1636
01:15:49.351 --> 01:15:51.228
Jordan, no.

1637
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:53.605
Look at me.
Look at me.

1638
01:15:53.688 --> 01:15:57.442
Don't you die. Don't you die.
I'm not gonna let you die.

1639
01:15:57.526 --> 01:16:02.572
Come on, Jordan. You can't...
you can't die, not...

1640
01:16:02.656 --> 01:16:06.076
Come on, Jordan.
Get up. Don't do...

1641
01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:09.120
Jordan! Jordan!

1642
01:16:09.204 --> 01:16:11.748
I jumped.
I got over here.

1643
01:16:11.832 --> 01:16:15.126
Jordan?
I fucking jumped!

1644
01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.755
I fucking jumped.

1645
01:16:22.384 --> 01:16:23.635
I fuckin'...

1646
01:16:23.718 --> 01:16:27.722
Breathe.

1647
01:16:27.806 --> 01:16:29.891
Bravo.

1648
01:16:29.975 --> 01:16:32.352
It's a wrap, everybody.

1649
01:16:32.435 --> 01:16:34.646
Bravo.

1650
01:16:39.651 --> 01:16:41.027
A wrap?

1651
01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:42.362
Agent Hart!

1652
01:16:42.445 --> 01:16:43.446
Coach Ron?

1653
01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:46.741
Woo! Yeah!

1654
01:16:46.825 --> 01:16:48.702
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah.

1655
01:16:48.785 --> 01:16:50.036
What the fuck
is happening?

1656
01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:54.374
Hey, baby. It was good workin'
with you.

1657
01:16:54.457 --> 01:16:56.084
No hard feelings, man.
Sorry.

1658
01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:06.803
- Hi.
- Oh, no. Come on, Jordan.

1659
01:17:06.887 --> 01:17:09.264
This was a part of it, too?
- Yeah.

1660
01:17:09.347 --> 01:17:11.808
Sorry, Kevin.
- Jordan.

1661
01:17:11.892 --> 01:17:14.019
I really thought
that I lost you.

1662
01:17:14.102 --> 01:17:16.855
Oh, Kevin.

1663
01:17:16.938 --> 01:17:19.024
Well, I guess I'm glad
that you're alive.

1664
01:17:19.107 --> 01:17:21.359
Well, movie magic.

1665
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:26.656
- Movie magic.
- Very good. Very good, guys.

1666
01:17:30.535 --> 01:17:33.288
Jordan, no.
Come on. Get up. Get up.

1667
01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:35.874
Jordan, you can't do this.
Don't die.

1668
01:17:35.957 --> 01:17:38.543
Come on, Jordan.
Get up. Don't do...

1669
01:17:38.627 --> 01:17:42.672
Jordan!
Jordan!

1670
01:17:42.756 --> 01:17:46.051
I did it. I jumped.
I got over here!

1671
01:17:46.134 --> 01:17:49.971
Jordan.
I fuckin' jumped!

1672
01:17:50.055 --> 01:17:53.433
I fuckin' jumped.

1673
01:18:09.574 --> 01:18:12.243
Well?

1674
01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:20.877
That may be the strangest
movie I've ever seen.

1675
01:18:23.922 --> 01:18:28.343
So bizarre
and-and-and violent.

1676
01:18:31.554 --> 01:18:36.142
And yet...
authentic.

1677
01:18:39.354 --> 01:18:41.564
You can't teach
acting like that.

1678
01:18:41.648 --> 01:18:42.899
- So, you liked it?
- Like it?

1679
01:18:42.983 --> 01:18:44.651
I like kidney-shaped
swimming pools.

1680
01:18:44.734 --> 01:18:46.444
I like reduced-fat
eggnog.

1681
01:18:46.528 --> 01:18:48.530
This movie?

1682
01:18:48.613 --> 01:18:50.490
I loved.

1683
01:18:50.573 --> 01:18:52.409
He loves it.

1684
01:18:52.492 --> 01:18:54.494
How does it feel
to be a leading man

1685
01:18:54.577 --> 01:18:56.121
in your own
action movie?

1686
01:18:56.204 --> 01:18:59.165
- Wow.
- Kevin, please.

1687
01:18:59.249 --> 01:19:00.959
Oh, the same stage.

1688
01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:02.419
Uh...

1689
01:19:02.502 --> 01:19:04.838
Oh, stop, stop.
Guys.

1690
01:19:04.921 --> 01:19:07.424
Well, I learned
two things.

1691
01:19:07.507 --> 01:19:09.843
The first thing is
that it's dangerous.

1692
01:19:09.926 --> 01:19:11.553
It's dangerous
as hell.

1693
01:19:11.636 --> 01:19:13.722
I mean, I was set on fire.

1694
01:19:13.805 --> 01:19:15.074
I was hit in the head
with a bat.

1695
01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:17.142
Punched. Kicked.
I'm really gonna be scarred.

1696
01:19:17.225 --> 01:19:19.185
Yeah, he probably is.

1697
01:19:19.269 --> 01:19:20.329
No, I'm serious. I don't know
why you're laughing,

1698
01:19:20.353 --> 01:19:21.855
I'm being very serious.

1699
01:19:21.938 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm gonna have real issues
because of this guy right here.

1700
01:19:24.024 --> 01:19:25.316
- Fuck yeah!
- It's not...

1701
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.653
It's not a fuck yeah.
It's a serious thing.

1702
01:19:30.989 --> 01:19:34.784
The second thing that
I learned is that, uh,

1703
01:19:34.868 --> 01:19:39.748
there's no such thing
as a leading man.

1704
01:19:39.831 --> 01:19:42.250
'Cause you're nothing
without your co-stars.

1705
01:19:45.545 --> 01:19:48.089
And I had that
in-in you guys.

1706
01:19:48.173 --> 01:19:49.966
So, thank you. Come on.
Get up here.

1707
01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:51.342
Seriously. Get up here.
- Bro.

1708
01:19:51.426 --> 01:19:52.761
- Buddy.
- Take this in.

1709
01:19:52.844 --> 01:19:54.387
Take it in with me.

1710
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:56.514
Wait, wait.
Do I get top billing?

1711
01:19:56.598 --> 01:19:57.849
Yeah. You'll have
top billing.

1712
01:19:57.932 --> 01:19:59.184
Nice.
I forgot to ask.

1713
01:19:59.267 --> 01:20:00.745
Well, I think it's time
to celebrate.

1714
01:20:00.769 --> 01:20:01.811
- Yes!
- Yes!

1715
01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:03.730
Looks like we've got
a hit on our hands!

1716
01:20:03.813 --> 01:20:05.857
Ron, congratulations!

1717
01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:09.944
Congratulations, everybody.

1718
01:20:10.028 --> 01:20:12.864
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a real treat for you today.

1719
01:20:12.947 --> 01:20:14.759
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Easy with the spoilers.

1720
01:20:14.783 --> 01:20:16.785
This requires a little
dramatic build-up.

1721
01:20:16.868 --> 01:20:18.328
Okay.
Here it is.

1722
01:20:18.411 --> 01:20:19.805
Now, you know that
I'm not a big fan

1723
01:20:19.829 --> 01:20:22.707
of these high-budget
action films.

1724
01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:23.792
Here she goes again

1725
01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:26.086
with her love
of fancy foreign films.

1726
01:20:26.169 --> 01:20:27.897
I have discerning taste.
This is my build-up.

1727
01:20:27.921 --> 01:20:29.672
This is what you requested.
- Continue.

1728
01:20:29.756 --> 01:20:32.300
This movie
by Claude Van De Velde moved me.

1729
01:20:32.383 --> 01:20:34.260
I gotta say.
- It's an incredible film.

1730
01:20:34.344 --> 01:20:36.137
I've seen it 27 times.

1731
01:20:36.221 --> 01:20:37.680
Team Van de Velde right here.

1732
01:20:37.764 --> 01:20:40.475
The hero of this movie
is not the action star

1733
01:20:40.558 --> 01:20:41.684
that you would expect.

1734
01:20:41.768 --> 01:20:44.521
The one that really
saves the day.

1735
01:20:44.604 --> 01:20:46.314
Well, we have him here today.

1736
01:20:46.397 --> 01:20:49.317
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sassy the squirrel.

1737
01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:53.446
Oh, you're a lot bigger
in person.

1738
01:20:53.530 --> 01:20:55.448
Oh, hell no.
