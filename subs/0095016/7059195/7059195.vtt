1
00:00:55.573 --> 00:00:58.926
You don't like flyin', do you?

2
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.078
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:07.811
You wanna know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:11.065
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and your socks.

5
00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:15.925
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:19.114
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:21.575
I know, I know. It sounds crazy.

8
00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:23.660
Trust me. I've been doin' it
for nine years.

9
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.789
Yes, sir. Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

10
00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:29.564
Okay.

11
00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:41.284
It's okay. I'm a cop.

12
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:47.351
Trust me. I've been
doin' this for 11 years.

13
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:49.936
On behalf of your captain and crew...

14
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.689
we'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.

15
00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:55.131
Have a very Merry Christmas.

16
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.706
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at Gate 14.

17
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.609
Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at Gate 14.

18
00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:21.616
Mr. Edward Machowski,
please report to the white courtesy phone.

19
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.059
Ah.

20
00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:31.334
How do you do?

21
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.452
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

22
00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:50.122
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

23
00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:54.649
for making this one of the greatest years
in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.

24
00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:03.385
On behalf of the chief executive officer,
Mr. Ozu, and the board of directors...

25
00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.037
we thank you, one and all, and wish you
a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

26
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:15.439
Hey, Holly, what about
dinner tonight, huh?

27
00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:17.941
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

28
00:03:17.965 --> 00:03:21.217
Families, stockings.

29
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.239
Chestnuts.

30
00:03:24.263 --> 00:03:26.408
Rudolph and Frosty.

31
00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:28.452
Any of these things ring a bell?

32
00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:33.332
Actually, I was thinkin' more of
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...

33
00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.334
and a roaring fireplace.

34
00:03:35.358 --> 00:03:38.151
You know what I'm sayin'?

35
00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:43.592
Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

36
00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:46.220
You're makin' me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

37
00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:49.890
Thanks a lot, Ms. Gennero. Do you
think the baby can handle a little sip?

38
00:03:49.914 --> 00:03:52.809
That baby's ready to tend bar.

39
00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.853
Last chance.

40
00:03:54.877 --> 00:03:57.962
Bye.

41
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.739
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

42
00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:10.160
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

43
00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:13.246
Mommy! When are you coming home?

44
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.626
Pretty soon. Pretty soon.
You'll be in bed when I get there though.

45
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.212
Let me talk to Paulina, okay, hon?

46
00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:24.383
And no snoopin' around the house
looking for presents.

47
00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:27.116
Is Daddy coming home with you?

48
00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:33.225
Well, we'll see what
Santa and Mommy can do, okay?

49
00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.310
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

50
00:04:35.334 --> 00:04:37.502
Paulina!

51
00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.361
Hola, Mrs. Holly.

52
00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:47.656
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

53
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.368
No, Mrs. Holly. No telefonó.

54
00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:54.371
Well, he probably just didn't
have time before his flight.

55
00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:58.458
Um, it might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom just in case.

56
00:04:58.482 --> 00:05:01.211
Sí, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.

57
00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.987
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

58
00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:31.180
California.

59
00:05:41.817 --> 00:05:43.795
Excuse me.

60
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:45.881
Hey, I'm John McClane.

61
00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:49.032
Argyle. I'm your limo driver.

62
00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:53.369
Nice bear.

63
00:05:57.458 --> 00:06:01.772
Okay, Argyle. What do we do now?

64
00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:04.274
I was, uh, hopin' you could tell me.

65
00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:06.693
It's my first time drivin' a limo.

66
00:06:06.717 --> 00:06:09.905
Oh, that's okay. It's my
first time ridin' in one.

67
00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:12.783
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

68
00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:16.286
Look at this - CD, C.B., TV...

69
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.248
telephone, full bar, VHS.

70
00:06:20.272 --> 00:06:23.941
If your friend's hot to trot, I know a
few mama bears we can hook up with.

71
00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:28.340
- Or is he married?
- He's married.

72
00:06:28.364 --> 00:06:30.615
Okay.

73
00:06:31.492 --> 00:06:34.805
Oh, sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

74
00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.808
I didn't know you were
gonna sit up front.

75
00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.851
So, uh, your lady live out here?

76
00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.978
About the past six months.

77
00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:45.065
Meaning you still live in New York.

78
00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.485
You always ask this
many questions, Argyle?

79
00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.261
Sorry, man. I used to drive a cab, and, uh,
people would expect a little chitchat.

80
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.493
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

81
00:06:56.517 --> 00:07:00.645
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up?

82
00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:07.336
He had a good job.
Turned into a great career.

83
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.256
Ah, that meant she had to move here.

84
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.509
You're very fast, Argyle.

85
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.451
So why didn't you come?

86
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.289
Well, why didn't you come
with her, man? What's up?

87
00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:23.520
'Cause I'm a New York cop.

88
00:07:23.544 --> 00:07:25.579
I got a six-month backlog of New York
scumbags

89
00:07:25.603 --> 00:07:27.023
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

90
00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:29.234
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

91
00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.736
In other words, you thought
she wasn't gonna make it out here...

92
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.738
and she'd come crawling
on back to you...

93
00:07:33.762 --> 00:07:36.366
so why bother to pack, right?

94
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.785
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

95
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:41.144
You mind if we hear some tunes?

96
00:07:44.148 --> 00:07:47.817
Hey, that'll work.

97
00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:51.006
Don't you got any Christmas music?

98
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.157
This is Christmas music.

99
00:08:22.853 --> 00:08:26.500
So your lady sees you, you run into
each other's arms, the music comes up...

100
00:08:26.524 --> 00:08:29.211
and you live happily
ever after, right?

101
00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:32.214
I can live with that.

102
00:08:32.238 --> 00:08:35.759
So if it doesn't work out, man,
you got a place to stay?

103
00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:39.262
- I'll find a place.
- I tell you what.

104
00:08:39.286 --> 00:08:41.973
I'm gonna pull in
the parking garage and I'll wait.

105
00:08:41.997 --> 00:08:44.266
You score, you give me a call
on the car phone.

106
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.269
I'll take your bags to the desk.

107
00:08:46.293 --> 00:08:48.646
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

108
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.899
You're all right, Argyle.

109
00:08:50.923 --> 00:08:54.050
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

110
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.969
Hi.

111
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:21.846
- Good evening.
- I'm here to see Holly McClane.

112
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.121
Just type it in there.

113
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:31.273
Cute toy.

114
00:09:31.297 --> 00:09:34.924
Yeah. You have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

115
00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:53.150
Christ.

116
00:09:57.573 --> 00:09:59.634
13th floor.

117
00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:02.636
The party. They're the only ones
left in the building.

118
00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.516
Take the express elevator.
Get off where you hear the noise.

119
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.708
Thanks.

120
00:11:05.974 --> 00:11:08.893
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah. Thanks.

121
00:11:43.637 --> 00:11:45.615
Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:48.391
Hey! Merry Christmas!

123
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.959
Jesus. Fuckin' California.

124
00:11:55.983 --> 00:11:58.169
I couldn't agree with you more.

125
00:11:58.193 --> 00:12:00.403
Why don't I talk to him right now?

126
00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:03.341
Hi. I'm looking for, uh -

127
00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:05.343
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

128
00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:06.944
Then you must be John McClane.

129
00:12:06.968 --> 00:12:08.722
- Joe Takagi.
- Hi.

130
00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:10.806
- How was your ride in?
- Nice.

131
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.185
- I have you to thank for that?
- It seemed the least we could do.

132
00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:16.186
It's quite a place you have here.

133
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.273
It will be
if we ever get it finished.

134
00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:20.442
There are still several
floors under construction.

135
00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:24.112
Holly went to the vault room to fax some
documents. She should be back any minute.

136
00:12:24.136 --> 00:12:26.762
In the meanwhile,
her office is right back here.

137
00:12:28.766 --> 00:12:31.225
Ellis.

138
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.249
I was just makin' a call,
and this was, uh, the nearest phone.

139
00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:39.942
I want you to meet
John McClane, Holly's husband.

140
00:12:41.236 --> 00:12:44.924
Holly's policeman. Ellis is in charge
of international development.

141
00:12:44.948 --> 00:12:47.343
Heard a heck of a lot about you.

142
00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.577
Missed some.

143
00:12:51.413 --> 00:12:56.019
Uh, could I get you anything? Food,
cake, uh, some watered-down champagne?

144
00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:59.105
No, thank you. I'm fine.

145
00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:02.108
You throw quite a party.

146
00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:04.861
I didn't realize they
celebrated Christmas in Japan.

147
00:13:04.885 --> 00:13:09.680
Hey, we're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't
work out, so we got you with tape decks.

148
00:13:12.184 --> 00:13:14.803
Actually, it's kind of sort of a double
celebration.

149
00:13:14.827 --> 00:13:16.039
We, uh, closed a pretty big deal today.

150
00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:17.999
And a lot of it was due to Holly.

151
00:13:18.023 --> 00:13:19.876
- Am I right, Jo-Jo?
- Go ahead without me.

152
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.777
I'll be about 4 minutes.

153
00:13:25.656 --> 00:13:27.907
John.

154
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.889
Have you met everyone?

155
00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.225
No, we've been sticking him
with spears.

156
00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:37.393
Of course he has.

157
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.104
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

158
00:13:40.128 --> 00:13:44.025
- Yeah.
- I was hoping you made that flight.

159
00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:46.694
Show him the watch.

160
00:13:46.718 --> 00:13:47.753
Later.

161
00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:49.989
Well, go on. Show him.
What, are you embarrassed?

162
00:13:50.013 --> 00:13:54.118
It's just a small token
of appreciation for all her hard work.

163
00:13:54.142 --> 00:13:56.204
It's a Rolex.

164
00:13:56.228 --> 00:13:58.248
I'm sure I'll see it later.

165
00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.583
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

166
00:14:00.607 --> 00:14:03.317
Sure.

167
00:14:18.458 --> 00:14:21.710
You'll have to forgive Ellis.
He gets very depressed this time of year.

168
00:14:23.005 --> 00:14:25.984
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

169
00:14:26.008 --> 00:14:28.278
Yeah, I know the type.

170
00:14:28.302 --> 00:14:31.446
I think he's got his eye on you.

171
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.451
It's okay. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

172
00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:37.620
Where you staying?

173
00:14:37.644 --> 00:14:41.541
Things happened so fast, I didn't
get a chance to ask you on the phone.

174
00:14:41.565 --> 00:14:45.295
- Cappy Roberts retired out here.
- Oh, yeah?

175
00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:48.506
- Told me I could bunk in with him.
- Cappy retired, huh?

176
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.758
- Where's he live?
- "Ramona."

177
00:14:50.782 --> 00:14:52.926
Pomona.

178
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.596
- Huh?
- Pomona.

179
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.516
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

180
00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:02.020
God, you'll be in the car
half the time.

181
00:15:02.044 --> 00:15:05.648
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

182
00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:08.568
I mean, it's not huge
or anything, but...

183
00:15:08.592 --> 00:15:12.261
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

184
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:16.390
They would, huh?

185
00:15:18.018 --> 00:15:20.455
I would too.

186
00:15:20.479 --> 00:15:22.999
Oh! Ooh!

187
00:15:23.023 --> 00:15:25.274
Sorry.

188
00:15:32.074 --> 00:15:34.783
I missed you.

189
00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:43.102
I guess you didn't miss
my name, though, huh?

190
00:15:43.126 --> 00:15:47.148
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

191
00:15:47.172 --> 00:15:49.465
Since when did you
start using "Ms. Gennero"?

192
00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:55.740
This is a Japanese company. They
figure a married woman's got one foot -

193
00:15:55.764 --> 00:15:57.992
You are a married woman, Holly.
You're married to me.

194
00:15:58.016 --> 00:16:00.954
Are we gonna have this conversation again?
We did this in July.

195
00:16:00.978 --> 00:16:03.246
- We never finished this conversation in July.
- I had an opportunity.

196
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.666
- I had to take it.
- Right. No matter what the consequences...

197
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.876
no matter what it did to our marriage,
you had to.

198
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.922
It didn't do anything except maybe change
your idea of what our marriage should be.

199
00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:13.925
I don't think you have a clue what my idea
of our marriage should be.

200
00:16:13.949 --> 00:16:16.469
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

201
00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:18.494
Ms. Gennero, I -

202
00:16:19.997 --> 00:16:23.832
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

203
00:16:24.835 --> 00:16:27.021
Um, Mr. Takagi is looking for you.

204
00:16:27.045 --> 00:16:29.581
He-He wants you to say
something to the troops.

205
00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:30.673
Thank you.

206
00:16:35.053 --> 00:16:39.932
Speech time.
Be back in a few minutes.

207
00:16:50.777 --> 00:16:53.006
That's great, John.

208
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.614
Good job. Very mature.

209
00:17:45.165 --> 00:17:48.311
So Kareem rebounds, right?
Feeds Worthy on the break.

210
00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:51.754
Over to A.C., to Magic,
then back to Worthy, right?

211
00:17:52.964 --> 00:17:55.674
Boom! Two points.

212
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.429
We're in.

213
00:20:29.996 --> 00:20:32.247
Left.

214
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.085
Right, and again left.

215
00:21:07.242 --> 00:21:10.035
Son of a bitch.

216
00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:14.206
Fists with your toes.

217
00:21:45.113 --> 00:21:47.091
Yeah, Argyle.

218
00:21:47.115 --> 00:21:50.176
- Hey, Mac! How's it goin' up there?
- Oh, all right. Where are you?

219
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.222
I'm kickin' it in the garage. What's
the word with you and your lady, man?

220
00:21:53.246 --> 00:21:55.789
Uh, the vote's not in yet.

221
00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:06.861
- Hey Brother.
- Just a moment.

222
00:22:06.885 --> 00:22:09.052
No, no... not yet, just wait...

223
00:22:26.488 --> 00:22:28.466
Argyle?

224
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.366
Mac, you there? Hello?

225
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.210
You know the number. Use it!

226
00:24:14.012 --> 00:24:19.099
Stay calm. Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

227
00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:40.036
Shit!

228
00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:45.834
Think. Think.

229
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:08.231
Ladies and gentlemen.

230
00:25:14.989 --> 00:25:19.094
"Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe...

231
00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:23.663
"they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

232
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.083
You will be witnesses."

233
00:25:29.045 --> 00:25:31.065
Now...

234
00:25:31.089 --> 00:25:33.256
where is Mr. Takagi?

235
00:25:35.677 --> 00:25:39.949
Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi.

236
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:42.451
Born, Kyoto, 1937.

237
00:25:42.475 --> 00:25:44.453
Don't move.

238
00:25:44.477 --> 00:25:50.084
Family emigrated
to San Pedro, California, 1939.

239
00:25:50.108 --> 00:25:54.630
Interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43.

240
00:25:54.654 --> 00:25:59.635
Scholarship student,
University of California...

241
00:25:59.659 --> 00:26:01.910
1955.

242
00:26:05.832 --> 00:26:10.646
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

243
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:15.484
M.B.A., Harvard, 1970.

244
00:26:15.508 --> 00:26:18.153
President, Nakatomi Trading.

245
00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:20.489
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group.

246
00:26:20.513 --> 00:26:22.722
Enough.

247
00:26:23.683 --> 00:26:27.329
And father of five.

248
00:26:27.353 --> 00:26:29.604
I am Takagi.

249
00:26:30.607 --> 00:26:32.585
How do you do?

250
00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:35.193
It's a pleasure to meet you.

251
00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:50.500
Computers. 32, construction.
33, computers.

252
00:27:03.264 --> 00:27:05.473
Nice suit.

253
00:27:06.267 --> 00:27:08.768
John Philips, London.

254
00:27:10.563 --> 00:27:12.833
I have two myself.

255
00:27:12.857 --> 00:27:16.151
Rumor has it Arafat buys his there.

256
00:27:20.698 --> 00:27:23.450
- In there?
- On the left. On the left.

257
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:50.579
"And when Alexander saw the
breadth of his domain, he wept...

258
00:27:50.603 --> 00:27:54.022
for there were no more
worlds to conquer."

259
00:27:57.985 --> 00:28:01.215
Benefits of a classical education.

260
00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:05.575
Oh, that's beautiful.

261
00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:09.806
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

262
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:15.020
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

263
00:28:15.044 --> 00:28:17.022
It's beautiful.

264
00:28:17.046 --> 00:28:20.215
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

265
00:28:21.426 --> 00:28:23.904
Contrary to what you people may think...

266
00:28:23.928 --> 00:28:27.282
we're going to develop that region,
not exploit it.

267
00:28:27.306 --> 00:28:32.811
I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.

268
00:28:34.147 --> 00:28:37.126
Mr. Takagi.

269
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.504
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day...

270
00:28:40.528 --> 00:28:42.631
but I'm afraid work must intrude...

271
00:28:42.655 --> 00:28:46.969
and my associate, Theo,
has some questions for you.

272
00:28:46.993 --> 00:28:50.412
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.

273
00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:02.359
I don't have that code.

274
00:29:02.383 --> 00:29:05.821
You broke in here
to access our computer?

275
00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:08.714
Any information you could get, when
they wake up in Tokyo in the morning,

276
00:29:08.738 --> 00:29:09.450
they'll change it.

277
00:29:09.474 --> 00:29:12.119
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives, threaten our profit -

278
00:29:12.143 --> 00:29:14.769
Sit down!

279
00:29:24.197 --> 00:29:28.575
Mr. Takagi, I'm really
not interested in your computer.

280
00:29:33.122 --> 00:29:37.519
But I need the code key
because I am interested...

281
00:29:37.543 --> 00:29:41.606
in the $640 million
in negotiable bearer bonds...

282
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.693
that you have locked in your vault.

283
00:29:44.717 --> 00:29:48.762
And the computer controls the vault.

284
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.034
You want money?

285
00:29:52.058 --> 00:29:54.726
What kind of terrorists are you?

286
00:29:57.855 --> 00:30:00.482
Who said we were terrorists?

287
00:30:08.115 --> 00:30:11.720
Mr. Takagi, I sympathize
with your reluctance...

288
00:30:11.744 --> 00:30:16.475
but I'm sure you realize you're not dealing
with anything significant here.

289
00:30:16.499 --> 00:30:19.561
It's not as if it's
the education of your children.

290
00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:22.396
The bonds represent, at most...

291
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.901
10 days operating capital
for your parent organization.

292
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:28.986
It's really no more than
a temporary inconvenience.

293
00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.179
Now...

294
00:30:35.184 --> 00:30:37.162
the code, please.

295
00:30:37.186 --> 00:30:39.373
It's useless to you.

296
00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:43.043
There are seven safeguards on our vault,
and the code key is only one of them.

297
00:30:43.067 --> 00:30:44.352
You'll never get it open.

298
00:30:44.376 --> 00:30:47.130
Then there's no
reason not to tell it to us.

299
00:30:47.154 --> 00:30:49.132
I told you.

300
00:30:49.156 --> 00:30:51.616
It's not over yet.

301
00:30:56.205 --> 00:31:00.143
That's a very nice suit, Mr. Takagi.

302
00:31:00.167 --> 00:31:02.877
It would be a shame to ruin it.

303
00:31:06.173 --> 00:31:08.694
I'm going to count to three.

304
00:31:08.718 --> 00:31:12.489
There will not be a four.

305
00:31:12.513 --> 00:31:15.723
Give me the code.

306
00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:18.685
One.

307
00:31:19.979 --> 00:31:22.230
Two.

308
00:31:24.025 --> 00:31:26.128
- Three.
- I don't know it, I'm telling you.

309
00:31:26.152 --> 00:31:28.630
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

310
00:31:28.654 --> 00:31:30.756
I'm telling you, you're just gonna
have to kill me.

311
00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.241
Okay.

312
00:31:36.162 --> 00:31:39.725
We'll do it the hard way.
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

313
00:31:39.749 --> 00:31:43.293
Karl, you'd better go and check on
Heinrich's work up on the machine floor.

314
00:32:07.485 --> 00:32:09.463
Nothing.

315
00:32:09.487 --> 00:32:11.863
See to Heinrich.

316
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.472
Now, you can break the code?

317
00:32:18.496 --> 00:32:22.707
You didn't bring me along
for my charming personality.

318
00:32:27.922 --> 00:32:32.778
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots
and you're callin' the police right now.

319
00:32:32.802 --> 00:32:36.448
Of course I'm still comin' by later.

320
00:32:36.472 --> 00:32:39.242
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

321
00:32:39.266 --> 00:32:42.143
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

322
00:32:42.895 --> 00:32:46.291
Uli, get up on the pipes.

323
00:32:46.315 --> 00:32:48.816
Marco, you go through here.

324
00:32:49.652 --> 00:32:51.630
I'll throw you the cord.

325
00:32:51.654 --> 00:32:53.905
Yeah.

326
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.992
Hans, we're on the roof.

327
00:33:10.756 --> 00:33:13.007
Here.

328
00:33:15.886 --> 00:33:18.137
Uli!

329
00:33:24.562 --> 00:33:29.209
Thirty minutes to break the code.
Two hours - two and a half hours...

330
00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:31.836
for the five mechanicals,
at the minimum.

331
00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.737
The seventh lock, however,
is out of my hands.

332
00:33:57.428 --> 00:33:59.990
- I'm sorry.
- The 7th lock.

333
00:34:00.014 --> 00:34:05.059
The electromagnetic seal. You do understand
the circuits cannot be cut locally.

334
00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:08.855
Trust me.

335
00:34:09.648 --> 00:34:12.317
Why the fuck didn't you
stop 'em, John?

336
00:34:13.569 --> 00:34:16.631
'Cause then you'd be
dead too, asshole.

337
00:34:16.655 --> 00:34:19.032
Think, goddamn it. Think!

338
00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:32.856
We've got a fire alarm.

339
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.858
Call 911.

340
00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:39.279
Give them the guard's name, the
building code number and cancel the alarm.

341
00:34:39.303 --> 00:34:41.804
Then disable the system.

342
00:34:44.016 --> 00:34:47.143
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

343
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.582
Now? Should we go?

344
00:34:50.606 --> 00:34:52.774
Nein.

345
00:35:02.868 --> 00:35:07.038
Yes. Oh, baby,
come to papa. Come on.

346
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.957
Ah!

347
00:35:11.752 --> 00:35:14.856
Baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

348
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.799
Come to papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' dalmatian.

349
00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:23.865
Oh, you stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

350
00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:26.641
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

351
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.969
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

352
00:36:06.724 --> 00:36:09.517
No one is coming to help you.

353
00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:16.983
You might as well come out
and join the others.

354
00:36:19.278 --> 00:36:21.904
I promise I won't hurt you.

355
00:36:50.476 --> 00:36:54.246
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

356
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:58.210
- You won't hurt me.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

357
00:36:58.234 --> 00:37:02.339
Because you're a policeman.
There are rules for policemen.

358
00:37:02.363 --> 00:37:06.199
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps tellin' me.

359
00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:19.378
Drop that, motherfucker!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

360
00:37:25.302 --> 00:37:28.262
Come on! Come on!
I'll fuckin' rip your head off?

361
00:38:12.099 --> 00:38:15.017
You bet your ass I wish to proceed.

362
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.677
Nine million terrorists in the world,

363
00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:58.990
and I gotta kill one with
feet smaller than my sister.

364
00:39:49.822 --> 00:39:54.386
I wanted this to be professional,
efficient, adult, cooperative.

365
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:58.473
Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way...

366
00:39:58.497 --> 00:40:02.541
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

367
00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:07.440
So we can go any way you want us.

368
00:40:07.464 --> 00:40:10.485
You can walk out of here
or be carried out.

369
00:40:10.509 --> 00:40:14.970
But have no illusions.
We are in charge.

370
00:40:15.973 --> 00:40:18.891
So, decide now, each of you.

371
00:40:19.685 --> 00:40:22.269
And, please remember...

372
00:40:23.105 --> 00:40:26.190
we have left nothing to chance.

373
00:40:34.366 --> 00:40:37.451
Get them back!

374
00:40:45.043 --> 00:40:47.837
"Now I have a machine gun.

375
00:40:49.506 --> 00:40:52.800
Ho-ho-ho."

376
00:40:55.554 --> 00:40:57.656
A security guard we missed?

377
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.993
They're usually tired old policemen
growing fat on a pension.

378
00:41:00.017 --> 00:41:01.995
No, no. This is something else.

379
00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:05.604
Oh, they're gonna kill us!

380
00:41:07.733 --> 00:41:12.630
What did I tell you?

381
00:41:12.654 --> 00:41:15.884
- We have to do something, Hans.
- Yes, we do.

382
00:41:15.908 --> 00:41:20.430
We have to tell Karl his brother is dead.
Tell him to come down.

383
00:41:20.454 --> 00:41:23.099
- Karl?
- Yeah?

384
00:41:23.123 --> 00:41:25.101
Karl, come down right away!

385
00:41:25.125 --> 00:41:28.271
Franco, you and Fritz take
the body upstairs and out of sight.

386
00:41:28.295 --> 00:41:30.940
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

387
00:41:30.964 --> 00:41:33.340
Come down right now... quickly...

388
00:42:35.279 --> 00:42:37.924
- I want blood!
- You'll have it.

389
00:42:37.948 --> 00:42:41.176
But let Heinrich plant the detonators
and Theo prepare the vault.

390
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.555
After we call the police,
they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...

391
00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:46.140
and then you can tear the building apart
looking for this man.

392
00:42:46.164 --> 00:42:49.102
But until then,
we do not alter the plan.

393
00:42:49.126 --> 00:42:51.961
And if he alters it?

394
00:42:56.508 --> 00:42:58.926
What do ya think?

395
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.656
Something's wrong.

396
00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.701
Cops?

397
00:43:04.725 --> 00:43:06.703
John.

398
00:43:06.727 --> 00:43:09.455
John? Aw, Christ.

399
00:43:09.479 --> 00:43:12.208
He could fuck this whole thing up.
What does he think he's doin'?

400
00:43:12.232 --> 00:43:14.669
- His job.
- Bullshit.

401
00:43:14.693 --> 00:43:16.838
His job's 3,000 miles away.

402
00:43:16.862 --> 00:43:18.840
Without him, we still have a chance.

403
00:43:18.864 --> 00:43:21.634
We might be able to get outta here.

404
00:43:21.658 --> 00:43:24.326
Tell that to Takagi.

405
00:43:47.476 --> 00:43:49.996
Mayday! Mayday!
Anyone copying? Channel 9.

406
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.040
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi building...

407
00:43:52.064 --> 00:43:54.083
and are holding at least
30 people hostage.

408
00:43:54.107 --> 00:43:57.253
I repeat, unknown number
of terrorists, six or more...

409
00:43:57.277 --> 00:44:00.715
armed with automatic weapons
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

410
00:44:00.739 --> 00:44:03.426
- Where's the best place to transmit?
- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!

411
00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.619
The roof! Go! Go!

412
00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:11.016
It's the same address as that fire signal.

413
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.292
I'll handle it.

414
00:44:15.379 --> 00:44:19.233
Attention, whoever you are. This channel's
reserved for emergency calls only.

415
00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:22.843
No fuckin' shit, lady.
Do I sound like I'm orderin' a pizza?

416
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.108
No one kills him but me.

417
00:44:38.985 --> 00:44:41.089
They have already
killed one hostage.

418
00:44:41.113 --> 00:44:44.425
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

419
00:44:44.449 --> 00:44:46.426
Now, send a police backup A.S.A.P.!

420
00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.763
Sir, I've already told you,
this is a reserved channel.

421
00:44:48.787 --> 00:44:52.642
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

422
00:44:52.666 --> 00:44:56.104
Otherwise, I'll have to report
this as an F.C.C. violation.

423
00:44:56.128 --> 00:44:58.773
Fine, report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

424
00:44:58.797 --> 00:45:01.651
Just send the police now!

425
00:45:01.675 --> 00:45:03.425
Ow!

426
00:45:07.097 --> 00:45:10.224
Whoa!

427
00:45:13.603 --> 00:45:17.231
See if there's a black-and-white
that can do a drive-by.

428
00:45:28.994 --> 00:45:30.972
I thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

429
00:45:30.996 --> 00:45:33.599
They're for my wife.

430
00:45:33.623 --> 00:45:35.643
Yeah.

431
00:45:35.667 --> 00:45:39.188
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

432
00:45:39.212 --> 00:45:42.066
Bag it.

433
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.216
Big time.

434
00:45:46.762 --> 00:45:49.013
Thanks.

435
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:53.828
Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30, over.

436
00:45:53.852 --> 00:45:55.830
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in, over.

437
00:45:55.854 --> 00:45:59.709
Investigate a code 2
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

438
00:45:59.733 --> 00:46:04.111
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

439
00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:36.935
Christ!

440
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.458
Girls.

441
00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:07.359
In the attic...

442
00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:22.749
Shit. Where the fuck is it?

443
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:45.981
Oh, my God.

444
00:48:52.113 --> 00:48:54.774
- Hans, we have a machine gun...
- Have you found him?

445
00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:56.363
He's in the furnace area of the roof...

446
00:48:59.245 --> 00:49:01.599
- He's in the furnace area of the roof...
- Where is Karl?

447
00:49:01.623 --> 00:49:04.185
- He's in the elevator shaft.
- Did you hear that?

448
00:49:04.209 --> 00:49:07.480
Perfect. The elevators are
locked off. He can't escape.

449
00:49:07.504 --> 00:49:09.671
Just shut him in and come back down.

450
00:49:13.176 --> 00:49:15.719
Oh, fuck.

451
00:49:20.433 --> 00:49:25.020
Karl, the police are probably
on their way already. Karl!

452
00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:48.043
Christ.

453
00:49:52.298 --> 00:49:54.694
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

454
00:49:54.718 --> 00:49:57.469
If you lock him in, he'll be neutralized

455
00:51:02.744 --> 00:51:06.246
"Come out to the coast.
We'll get together, have a few laughs."

456
00:51:13.213 --> 00:51:16.965
Now I know what
a TV dinner feels like.

457
00:52:23.533 --> 00:52:25.992
Karl, come! Police! Hurry...

458
00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.791
It's about time.

459
00:53:20.006 --> 00:53:22.443
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

460
00:53:22.467 --> 00:53:26.094
8-L-30, roger. Possible crank call.
Check the area again and confirm.

461
00:53:31.643 --> 00:53:34.895
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

462
00:53:37.106 --> 00:53:40.753
I do see a guard inside.
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

463
00:53:40.777 --> 00:53:43.028
8-L-30, Roger. Use caution.

464
00:53:45.698 --> 00:53:50.035
- Eddie?
- I had a feeling you'd be callin'.

465
00:54:13.393 --> 00:54:16.102
Good evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

466
00:54:19.816 --> 00:54:25.067
- How many are there? - Just one man.
- Someone is "jumping the gun".

467
00:54:27.323 --> 00:54:29.468
We had that false alarm, you know?

468
00:54:29.492 --> 00:54:33.806
Ask me, that god-damn computer
sent you out on another wild goose chase.

469
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.268
They've been chasing bugs in this
system ever since they installed it.

470
00:54:37.292 --> 00:54:41.438
- Notre Dame on top of USC.
- Aw, shit!

471
00:54:41.462 --> 00:54:44.256
Come on. I got 50 bucks
bet on them assholes.

472
00:54:45.675 --> 00:54:50.011
Come on. Come on.
Where's the fucking cavalry?

473
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:06.730
He's on the 34th floor. Go, hurry.

474
00:55:13.036 --> 00:55:15.596
It was good for 52 yards.

475
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.891
You don't mind if I take
a look around, do you?

476
00:55:17.915 --> 00:55:20.476
No, help yourself.

477
00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:25.380
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.
The Irish driving 74 yards in eight plays-

478
00:55:27.216 --> 00:55:31.155
This fucking -
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

479
00:55:31.179 --> 00:55:32.255
- Don't! Don't!
- Put that fucking gun down!

480
00:55:32.279 --> 00:55:33.532
Put the gun down!

481
00:55:33.556 --> 00:55:36.243
- Okay! Don't shoot!
- Drop the fucking gun!

482
00:55:36.267 --> 00:55:38.018
Marco, duck!

483
00:55:54.452 --> 00:55:57.621
Aw, the hell with this.

484
00:56:04.462 --> 00:56:07.232
You are done!

485
00:56:07.256 --> 00:56:10.361
No more table.
Where are you going, pal?

486
00:56:10.385 --> 00:56:14.888
Next time you have
a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate.

487
00:56:22.063 --> 00:56:23.999
Thanks for the advice.

488
00:56:24.023 --> 00:56:26.001
Sorry to waste your time.

489
00:56:26.025 --> 00:56:28.003
No problem at all.

490
00:56:28.027 --> 00:56:30.737
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

491
00:56:44.794 --> 00:56:47.379
Oh, for the love of -

492
00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:53.153
- 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
- 8-L-30, go ahead.

493
00:56:53.177 --> 00:56:55.781
Yeah, that's a wild goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

494
00:56:55.805 --> 00:56:58.932
Everything here's okay. Over.

495
00:57:07.483 --> 00:57:10.443
Damn! Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

496
00:57:16.826 --> 00:57:19.054
Welcome to the party, pal!

497
00:57:19.078 --> 00:57:21.121
Goddamn it!

498
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:29.898
Now means now, goddamn it!

499
00:57:29.922 --> 00:57:32.109
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

500
00:57:32.133 --> 00:57:34.194
I need backup assistance now!

501
00:57:34.218 --> 00:57:37.095
Now, goddamn it! Now!

502
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:58.010
Monica, I can get us a table.

503
00:57:58.034 --> 00:58:00.012
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

504
00:58:00.036 --> 00:58:02.014
Officer in need of assistance.

505
00:58:02.038 --> 00:58:04.141
- I interviewed him.
- Reports of shots fired at Nakatomi.

506
00:58:04.165 --> 00:58:06.143
2000 block, Avenue of the Stars.

507
00:58:06.167 --> 00:58:08.353
Repeat, officer
needs assistance at -

508
00:58:08.377 --> 00:58:11.606
I'm in Nakatomi Plaza.
They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!

509
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.967
I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!

510
00:58:36.739 --> 00:58:38.759
I never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

511
00:58:38.783 --> 00:58:43.388
All of you, relax. This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

512
00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:45.556
Police action was inevitable...

513
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:48.435
and, as it happens, necessary.

514
00:58:48.459 --> 00:58:52.064
So let them fumble about
outside and stay calm.

515
00:58:52.088 --> 00:58:54.233
This is simply the beginning.

516
00:58:54.257 --> 00:58:58.654
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence until further-

517
00:58:58.678 --> 00:59:01.406
Oh, I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

518
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:04.868
Maybe you should have
put it on the bulletin board.

519
00:59:04.892 --> 00:59:07.371
I figured since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend here...

520
00:59:07.395 --> 00:59:10.249
I figured you and Karl and Franco
might be a little lonely.

521
00:59:10.273 --> 00:59:12.416
So I wanted to give you a call.

522
00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.692
How does he know so much about -

523
00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.632
That's very kind of you.

524
00:59:18.656 --> 00:59:22.511
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

525
00:59:22.535 --> 00:59:25.973
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

526
00:59:25.997 --> 00:59:28.892
Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

527
00:59:28.916 --> 00:59:33.336
Would you like to go for "Double Jeopardy"
where the scores can really change?

528
00:59:37.008 --> 00:59:39.194
Hmm. These are very bad for you.

529
00:59:39.218 --> 00:59:41.613
Who are you then?

530
00:59:41.637 --> 00:59:45.450
Just a fly in the ointment, Hans.
A monkey in the wrench.

531
00:59:45.474 --> 00:59:48.268
A pain in the ass.

532
00:59:49.562 --> 00:59:52.583
Whoa.

533
00:59:52.607 --> 00:59:55.126
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

534
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:59.571
See if he's lying about Marco,
and find out if anyone else is missing.

535
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:05.285
Mr. Mystery Guest...

536
01:00:06.454 --> 01:00:08.640
are you still there?

537
01:00:08.664 --> 01:00:13.145
Yeah, I'm still here. Unless you
wanna open the front door for me.

538
01:00:13.169 --> 01:00:15.146
No, I'm afraid not.

539
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:17.858
But you have me at a loss.

540
01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:19.860
You know my name, but who are you?

541
01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:24.948
Just another American who saw
too many movies as a child?

542
01:00:24.972 --> 01:00:29.036
Another orphan of a bankrupt culture
who thinks he's John Wayne?

543
01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.913
Rambo? Marshal Dillon?

544
01:00:31.937 --> 01:00:35.166
I was always kind of partial
to Roy Rogers actually.

545
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.169
I really liked those sequin shirts.

546
01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:40.653
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?

547
01:00:42.823 --> 01:00:46.159
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

548
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.073
I can get the jump on everybody

549
01:00:51.097 --> 01:00:52.684
- if I get a remote.
- I don't have the new pages.

550
01:00:52.708 --> 01:00:56.229
- Where's the Gladden report?
- Harvey, keep your pants on, will you?

551
01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.413
Sam, look, I'm begging you.

552
01:00:57.437 --> 01:00:59.733
Simon's already at a remote thing
with that Santa sing-along.

553
01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:02.486
- I'll tell him to swing by.
- I'm not sitting on this for Simon!

554
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:04.488
- I don't wanna hear it!
- This is my story!

555
01:01:04.512 --> 01:01:06.990
- I can't hear you.
- All right, look. Sam, I tell you what.

556
01:01:07.014 --> 01:01:09.910
You don't wanna give me a truck,
I'll go and I'll steal a truck.

557
01:01:09.934 --> 01:01:12.496
- Give us a break, Thornburg.
- Eat it, Harvey!

558
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.583
Four, three, two, one.

559
01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:19.359
Harvey, we're on the air.

560
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.989
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

561
01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:30.722
And I'm Gail Wallens, and this is
Nightline News at 10:00.

562
01:01:30.746 --> 01:01:33.516
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve-

563
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.626
Take truck number five
and get out of here.

564
01:01:43.592 --> 01:01:47.948
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

565
01:01:47.972 --> 01:01:50.200
And the other man was Heinrich.

566
01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:53.017
And his bag is missing.

567
01:01:54.437 --> 01:01:56.938
But he had the detonators.

568
01:01:59.567 --> 01:02:01.734
Theo.

569
01:02:02.570 --> 01:02:05.298
- Theo.
- Yo!

570
01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:08.199
We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?

571
01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:14.349
- Three down, four to go.
- Then don't waste time talking to me.

572
01:02:14.373 --> 01:02:17.894
This is Sergeant Al Powell
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

573
01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:20.605
If the person who radioed for help
can hear me on this channel...

574
01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:23.734
acknowledge this transmission.

575
01:02:23.758 --> 01:02:27.154
I say again, if the person who radioed
for help on this channel can hear me...

576
01:02:27.178 --> 01:02:29.887
acknowledge this transmission.

577
01:02:34.059 --> 01:02:36.621
I read you, Powell.
You the guy in the car?

578
01:02:36.645 --> 01:02:38.665
What's left of him.

579
01:02:38.689 --> 01:02:42.711
- Can you identify yourself?
- Not now. Maybe later.

580
01:02:42.735 --> 01:02:46.423
Listen fast. This is a party line, and
the neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

581
01:02:46.447 --> 01:02:49.926
All right, here's the deal. You got
30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.

582
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:53.072
- The leader, his name is Hans.
- We have to find him and shut him up.

583
01:02:53.096 --> 01:02:54.697
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him.

584
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:56.290
I'm waiting for the
FBI to arrive. Until then,

585
01:02:56.314 --> 01:03:01.062
he can waste as much time as
he likes, but we must find the bag.

586
01:03:01.086 --> 01:03:04.441
- Fritz, go help Uli. We must have the detonators.
- They got an arsenal up here.

587
01:03:04.465 --> 01:03:07.068
They got missiles, automatic weapons...

588
01:03:07.092 --> 01:03:09.154
and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

589
01:03:09.178 --> 01:03:13.074
They're down to nine now,
countin' the skydiver you met.

590
01:03:13.098 --> 01:03:17.351
These guys are mostly European,
judging by their clothing labels and...

591
01:03:23.818 --> 01:03:25.796
cigarettes.

592
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.048
They're well-financed
and very slick.

593
01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:29.523
Well how do you know that?

594
01:03:29.547 --> 01:03:31.635
I've seen enough phony ID's in my time...

595
01:03:31.659 --> 01:03:35.078
to recognize that the ones they got
must've cost a fortune.

596
01:03:37.832 --> 01:03:40.352
Add all that up, I don't know
what the fuck it means.

597
01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:44.128
But you got some badass perpetrators,
and they're here to stay.

598
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:48.443
I hear you, partner.
L.A.'s finest are on it.

599
01:03:48.467 --> 01:03:52.470
- So light 'em if you got 'em.
- Way ahead of you, partner.

600
01:03:53.973 --> 01:03:56.224
So what do I call you?

601
01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.373
Call me... Roy.

602
01:04:01.397 --> 01:04:03.375
Well, listen up, Roy.

603
01:04:03.399 --> 01:04:06.670
If you think of anything else you think
we need to know, don't be shy, okay?

604
01:04:06.694 --> 01:04:09.548
In the meantime, find a safe place
to hole up and let us do our job.

605
01:04:09.572 --> 01:04:12.865
- Understand?
- They're all yours, Al.

606
01:04:30.384 --> 01:04:32.904
All right, who's talking to 'em?

607
01:04:32.928 --> 01:04:36.616
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

608
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.161
Dwayne Robinson, Powell. What's the
deal here? What do these pricks want?

609
01:04:40.185 --> 01:04:42.998
Well, if you mean the terrorists, sir,
we don't exactly know.

610
01:04:43.022 --> 01:04:45.000
We haven't heard a peep from them.

611
01:04:45.024 --> 01:04:47.711
Well, who in the hell
have you been talking to?

612
01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:50.672
We don't know that either, sir.
He won't give us his name.

613
01:04:50.696 --> 01:04:53.174
But he appears to be the one
who phoned in the report.

614
01:04:53.198 --> 01:04:56.595
He's killed one terrorist for sure,
and he claims he's capped off two others.

615
01:04:56.619 --> 01:04:58.805
He claims?

616
01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:02.559
Has it occurred to you he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain?

617
01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:04.811
Or some nutcase in there?

618
01:05:04.835 --> 01:05:07.564
I don't think so, sir.
In fact, I think he's a cop.

619
01:05:07.588 --> 01:05:10.332
Maybe not LAPD, but
he's definitely a badge.

620
01:05:10.356 --> 01:05:11.568
How do you know that?

621
01:05:11.592 --> 01:05:14.613
A hunch. Things he said...

622
01:05:14.637 --> 01:05:17.240
like being able to spot a phony ID

623
01:05:17.264 --> 01:05:21.411
Jesus Christ, Powell! He could be
a fucking bartender for all we know.

624
01:05:21.435 --> 01:05:25.771
- TV's here.
- Oh, shit.

625
01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.326
I'm not gonna warn you again.

626
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.059
I have a request.

627
01:05:44.083 --> 01:05:48.563
- What idiot put you in charge?
- You did...

628
01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:50.899
when you murdered my boss.

629
01:05:50.923 --> 01:05:52.901
Now everybody's looking to me.

630
01:05:52.925 --> 01:05:58.262
Personally, I'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

631
01:06:06.355 --> 01:06:08.333
Go on.

632
01:06:08.357 --> 01:06:10.376
We have a pregnant woman out there.

633
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.380
Relax. She's not due
for a couple of weeks.

634
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:16.549
But sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

635
01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:20.284
So I would like permission to move her
to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

636
01:06:22.079 --> 01:06:24.849
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out to you. Good enough?

637
01:06:24.873 --> 01:06:26.893
Good enough.

638
01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:30.503
And unless you like it messy, I'd start
bringing us in groups to the bathroom.

639
01:06:32.464 --> 01:06:36.152
Yes, you're right.
It will be done.

640
01:06:36.176 --> 01:06:39.178
Was there something else?

641
01:06:40.305 --> 01:06:42.515
No. Thank you.

642
01:06:48.647 --> 01:06:51.357
- Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs.
-

643
01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:55.130
Gennero.

644
01:06:55.154 --> 01:06:58.239
Miss Gennero.

645
01:07:00.242 --> 01:07:02.721
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

646
01:07:02.745 --> 01:07:06.808
This is Richard Thornburg,
live from Century City.

647
01:07:06.832 --> 01:07:08.976
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined...

648
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.022
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities...

649
01:07:12.046 --> 01:07:14.024
whose only membership requirement...

650
01:07:14.048 --> 01:07:17.276
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

651
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.740
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men...

652
01:07:21.764 --> 01:07:24.366
seized control
of the Nakatomi building...

653
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:26.786
sealing off all entrances and exits.

654
01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:28.830
All telephone lines have been cut.

655
01:07:28.854 --> 01:07:31.206
And the only communication
now possible...

656
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:34.461
has been through the use
of C.B. communicators...

657
01:07:34.485 --> 01:07:36.671
which the group
apparently brought with them.

658
01:07:36.695 --> 01:07:41.259
According to official sources,
the perpetrators-

659
01:07:41.283 --> 01:07:44.136
Unit Five, hold your
position at the main entrance.

660
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.766
All right, guys, we got Charlie Unit
in position by the parking structure.

661
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:52.312
Let me ask you something.
Does this stairway go up to the escalator?

662
01:07:52.336 --> 01:07:54.439
- Yeah. That's where they're going.
- Tell them to go ahead.

663
01:07:54.463 --> 01:07:55.581
Through the lobby up there

664
01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:58.651
- and try and draw some fire.
- What's going on?

665
01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:00.820
What's it look like?
We're going in.

666
01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.490
Goin' in? Man, that's crazy!

667
01:08:03.514 --> 01:08:06.034
There could be over 30 hostages in there
for all we know.

668
01:08:06.058 --> 01:08:08.661
We don't know shit, Powell.
If there's hostages...

669
01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:11.372
how come nobody's come to us
with ransom demands?

670
01:08:11.396 --> 01:08:15.168
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

671
01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.336
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

672
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.341
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
you've been talking to on that radio.

673
01:08:21.365 --> 01:08:25.470
Excuse me, sir, but what about the body
that fell out the window?

674
01:08:25.494 --> 01:08:28.515
Well, who knows? It was probably
some stockbroker who got depressed.

675
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:31.016
- We're ready for you, Chief.
- All right, light 'em up. Let's go.

676
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.520
- All right, hit your lights.
- Blue Unit, go.

677
01:08:33.544 --> 01:08:36.253
- We got approval, Chief.
- Lights on!

678
01:08:37.756 --> 01:08:39.340
Down a little.

679
01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:49.285
Al.

680
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:51.955
Al, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

681
01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:54.040
Yo, Al?

682
01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:57.876
I'm here, Roy. I'm kind of busy right now.
I'll talk to you later.

683
01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.672
- What's wrong? What's going on?
- I said I'll talk to you later.

684
01:09:00.696 --> 01:09:03.515
If you are what I think you are,
then you'll know when to listen,

685
01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:06.160
when to shut up, and--

686
01:09:06.384 --> 01:09:08.888
And when to pray.

687
01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:11.182
Jesus Christ. You're coming in.
That's it, isn't it?

688
01:09:11.206 --> 01:09:14.769
Christ, Powell, I told you what kind
of people you're dealing with here.

689
01:09:14.793 --> 01:09:17.336
- All right, let's load 'em up.
- Blue, go.

690
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.986
So, they'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

691
01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:27.012
Theo, you are the eyes now.

692
01:09:38.984 --> 01:09:40.962
- Rivers!
- Yo!

693
01:09:40.986 --> 01:09:43.756
Begin your reconnoiter.

694
01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.031
Let's go!

695
01:09:47.950 --> 01:09:50.411
Shit!

696
01:10:08.889 --> 01:10:11.640
Hey, come on. Let's go!

697
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.068
Ow! Jesus.

698
01:10:56.937 --> 01:10:59.188
All right, spread out.

699
01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:28.194
Shut up.

700
01:11:28.218 --> 01:11:30.469
Let's go!

701
01:11:35.142 --> 01:11:37.309
You macho assholes. No! No!

702
01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:43.107
All right. Listen up, guys.

703
01:11:45.569 --> 01:11:48.923
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house...

704
01:11:48.947 --> 01:11:51.092
not a creature was stirring,
except...

705
01:11:51.116 --> 01:11:54.136
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

706
01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.161
in standard two-by-two
cover formation.

707
01:11:58.707 --> 01:12:01.060
Okay, we're all set.

708
01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:03.479
We're ready.

709
01:12:03.503 --> 01:12:05.690
- Kick ass.
- Go!

710
01:12:05.714 --> 01:12:07.965
Right. Let's do it.

711
01:12:23.357 --> 01:12:26.753
- Take cover!
- They're shootin' at 'em!

712
01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.880
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

713
01:12:28.904 --> 01:12:31.030
They're shootin' at the lights.

714
01:12:35.494 --> 01:12:38.871
They're going after the lights.
Pull 'em back.

715
01:12:40.165 --> 01:12:42.541
- It's not happening.
- Mike, burn it.

716
01:12:44.544 --> 01:12:46.272
Don't be impatient.

717
01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:49.435
Just wound them.

718
01:12:50.759 --> 01:12:51.293
Get 'em back.

719
01:12:51.317 --> 01:12:53.279
- They're sittin' ducks up there without lights.
- No, no, they're almost in.

720
01:12:53.303 --> 01:12:56.616
- Get 'em back!
- They're almost in. Send in the car.

721
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.515
Send in the car.

722
01:13:11.613 --> 01:13:14.365
Jesus Christ!

723
01:13:16.118 --> 01:13:18.930
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

724
01:13:18.954 --> 01:13:22.081
Whoa! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

725
01:13:25.919 --> 01:13:28.796
The police have themselves an R.V.

726
01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:36.512
Southeast corner.

727
01:13:37.347 --> 01:13:40.015
Hurry...

728
01:13:48.233 --> 01:13:50.442
Oh, Jesus Christ.

729
01:14:02.122 --> 01:14:05.082
Out of here! Get back!
Get the fuck back!

730
01:14:06.626 --> 01:14:09.962
- Get over there!
- Hurry.

731
01:14:12.052 --> 01:14:16.302
Shit - Leave it. Move on.

732
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:45.164
I see him!

733
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.838
- Ready?
- Just a moment.

734
01:15:04.226 --> 01:15:07.246
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast.

735
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.415
- All right, all right!
- Get them out of the car. Let's go!

736
01:15:09.439 --> 01:15:12.668
- Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
- Hit it again.

737
01:15:12.692 --> 01:15:16.005
Hans, you motherfucker, you
made your point! Let 'em pull back!

738
01:15:16.029 --> 01:15:19.091
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

739
01:15:19.115 --> 01:15:21.158
Hit it again.

740
01:15:33.505 --> 01:15:35.881
Fire.

741
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.250
Fuck me.

742
01:15:52.274 --> 01:15:55.084
Let's go! Get 'em out of the car.
Don't you know they're burning?

743
01:16:04.286 --> 01:16:06.764
Fuck it.

744
01:16:06.788 --> 01:16:08.747
Bring the other one over here.
Hurry.

745
01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:21.969
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerk-weed.

746
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.599
Geronimo, motherfucker!

747
01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.663
Oh, shit!

748
01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:54.103
They're using artillery on us!

749
01:16:54.127 --> 01:16:58.755
You idiot.
It's not the police. It's him.

750
01:17:05.347 --> 01:17:07.514
Holy shit.

751
01:17:12.646 --> 01:17:14.980
My God.

752
01:17:16.316 --> 01:17:20.588
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it. I got it.

753
01:17:20.612 --> 01:17:23.132
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

754
01:17:23.156 --> 01:17:27.178
We've had an update on the terrorist
takeover of the Nakatomi building.

755
01:17:27.202 --> 01:17:31.515
Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,
may be this man, Hans Gruber...

756
01:17:31.539 --> 01:17:34.976
a member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.

757
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.648
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqué an hour ago...

758
01:17:38.672 --> 01:17:41.316
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.

759
01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:45.236
- Al, do you copy?
- Are you all right?

760
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.616
Yeah, I'm fine.

761
01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:50.743
What-What was that?

762
01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:52.552
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

763
01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:54.304
- Yeah.
- There you go.

764
01:17:54.328 --> 01:17:56.040
Is the building on fire?

765
01:17:56.064 --> 01:18:00.211
No, but it's gonna need a paint job
and a shitload of screen doors.

766
01:18:00.235 --> 01:18:02.254
Our spotters say
you got two with that blast.

767
01:18:02.278 --> 01:18:04.256
Is that him? Is that him?

768
01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.258
- Yes, sir.
- Give me that.

769
01:18:06.282 --> 01:18:09.636
You listen to me, mister. I don't know
who in the hell you think you are...

770
01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:11.931
or what you're doing,
but you just destroyed a building!

771
01:18:11.955 --> 01:18:17.103
Now, we do not want your help.
Is that clear? We don't want your help.

772
01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:20.272
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

773
01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:24.383
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?
Who the fuck is this?

774
01:18:25.885 --> 01:18:28.406
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T. Robinson...

775
01:18:28.430 --> 01:18:30.574
and I am in charge
of this situation.

776
01:18:30.598 --> 01:18:34.536
Oh, you're in charge? Well, I got some
bad news for you, Dwayne.

777
01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.873
From up here it doesn't look like
you're in charge of jack shit.

778
01:18:37.897 --> 01:18:41.001
You listen to me, you
little asshole. I'm - - Asshole?

779
01:18:41.025 --> 01:18:45.172
I'm not the one who just got butt-fucked
on national TV, Dwayne.

780
01:18:45.196 --> 01:18:48.050
Now, you listen to me, jerk-off.

781
01:18:48.074 --> 01:18:50.553
If you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

782
01:18:50.577 --> 01:18:54.121
Quit being part of the fucking problem
and put the other guy back on!

783
01:18:56.916 --> 01:18:58.894
Hey, Roy. How you feelin'?

784
01:18:58.918 --> 01:19:01.396
Pretty fuckin' unappreciated, Al.

785
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:05.693
Hey, look. I love you.
So do a lot of the other guys.

786
01:19:05.717 --> 01:19:10.554
So you hang in there, man.
You hear me? You hang in there.

787
01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:14.933
Yeah, thanks, partner.

788
01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.834
What are you doing?

789
01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:25.421
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see
who gets us killed first -

790
01:19:25.445 --> 01:19:27.423
them or your husband.

791
01:19:27.447 --> 01:19:29.425
What are you going to do?

792
01:19:29.449 --> 01:19:31.719
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

793
01:19:31.743 --> 01:19:34.722
I think I can handle
this Euro-trash. Hey.

794
01:19:34.746 --> 01:19:37.308
Sprechen sie talk? Huh?

795
01:19:37.332 --> 01:19:40.186
If you listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

796
01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:44.106
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

797
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:46.525
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- What does he want?

798
01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:50.469
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

799
01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.039
Look, let's be straight, okay?

800
01:20:00.063 --> 01:20:04.752
It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck
up here to snatch a few purses. Am I right?

801
01:20:04.776 --> 01:20:08.380
- You're very perceptive.
- I watch 60 Minutes.

802
01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:12.176
I say to myself, "These guys are
professional, they're motivated...

803
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:15.179
they're happening,
i.e. they want something."

804
01:20:15.203 --> 01:20:18.098
Now, personally, I couldn't care less
about your politics.

805
01:20:18.122 --> 01:20:20.309
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

806
01:20:20.333 --> 01:20:23.270
Maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland.
It's none of my business.

807
01:20:23.294 --> 01:20:25.815
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

808
01:20:25.839 --> 01:20:29.443
You're amazing.
You figured this all out already?

809
01:20:29.467 --> 01:20:33.781
Hey, business is business.
You use a gun. I use a fountain pen.

810
01:20:33.805 --> 01:20:36.325
What's the difference?
Let's put it in my terms.

811
01:20:36.349 --> 01:20:38.953
You're here in a hostile takeover,
you grab us for some greenmail...

812
01:20:38.977 --> 01:20:42.331
but you didn't expect some poison pill was
gonna be running around in the building.

813
01:20:42.355 --> 01:20:43.999
Am I right?

814
01:20:44.023 --> 01:20:49.027
Hans, Bubbe, I'm your white knight.

815
01:20:50.613 --> 01:20:53.907
I must have missed 60 Minutes.
What are you saying?

816
01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:59.704
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up? Huh?

817
01:21:03.793 --> 01:21:06.211
I can give him to you.

818
01:21:08.339 --> 01:21:10.674
Oh, God!

819
01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:15.095
Roy! Roy, you all right?

820
01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:20.744
Just trying to fire down
a thousand-year-old Twinkie

821
01:21:20.768 --> 01:21:23.414
What do they put
in these things, anyway?

822
01:21:23.438 --> 01:21:27.376
Sugar-enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil...

823
01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:30.963
polysorbate 60
and yellow dye number five.

824
01:21:30.987 --> 01:21:33.966
Just everything a growing boy needs.

825
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:35.968
How many kids you got, Al?

826
01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:40.055
Well, as a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

827
01:21:40.079 --> 01:21:44.416
How about you, cowboy?
You got any kids back on your ranch?

828
01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:48.772
Yeah. Two.

829
01:21:48.796 --> 01:21:52.985
I sure hope I can see 'em swinging
on a jungle gym with Al Jr. someday.

830
01:21:53.009 --> 01:21:57.489
Well, now, that's a date.

831
01:21:57.513 --> 01:22:00.075
But, uh, you're gonna have
to bring the ice cream.

832
01:22:00.099 --> 01:22:03.162
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

833
01:22:03.186 --> 01:22:08.000
Or should I call you Mr. McClane?

834
01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:10.586
Mr. Officer John McClane...

835
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:13.320
of the New York Police Department.

836
01:22:14.322 --> 01:22:17.176
- Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
- Got it.

837
01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.595
Better get ahold
of somebody at Dispatch.

838
01:22:19.619 --> 01:22:24.350
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in third grade.

839
01:22:24.374 --> 01:22:26.435
My friends call me John.

840
01:22:26.459 --> 01:22:28.793
You're neither, shithead.

841
01:22:30.797 --> 01:22:33.192
I have someone
who wants to talk to you -

842
01:22:33.216 --> 01:22:35.194
a very special friend...

843
01:22:35.218 --> 01:22:38.011
who was with you
at the party tonight.

844
01:22:43.893 --> 01:22:46.144
Hey, John Boy.

845
01:22:47.355 --> 01:22:51.418
- Ellis?
- Yeah. Now, listen, John.

846
01:22:51.442 --> 01:22:54.338
They're givin' me a few minutes
to try to talk some sense into you.

847
01:22:54.362 --> 01:22:57.466
I know you think you're doing your job,
and I can appreciate that...

848
01:22:57.490 --> 01:22:59.635
but you're just
dragging this thing out.

849
01:22:59.659 --> 01:23:02.388
Now, look, no one gets out of here
until these guys...

850
01:23:02.412 --> 01:23:04.390
can talk to the L.A. police...

851
01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:07.832
and that just ain't gonna happen until
you stop messing up the works, capisce?

852
01:23:12.964 --> 01:23:15.173
Ellis, what have you told them?

853
01:23:16.467 --> 01:23:21.656
I told them we were old friends,
and you were my guest at the party.

854
01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:23.659
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

855
01:23:23.683 --> 01:23:26.768
Tell me about it.

856
01:23:31.357 --> 01:23:33.335
All right, John, listen.

857
01:23:33.359 --> 01:23:36.964
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

858
01:23:36.988 --> 01:23:39.716
They know people are listening.

859
01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.201
They want the detonators
or they're gonna kill me.

860
01:23:45.955 --> 01:23:48.164
John, didn't you hear me?

861
01:23:50.334 --> 01:23:52.312
Yeah, I hear you.

862
01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:54.940
John, I think you could get
with the program a little, huh?

863
01:23:54.964 --> 01:23:56.942
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

864
01:23:56.966 --> 01:23:59.820
Now tell these guys where the detonators
are so no one else gets hurt.

865
01:23:59.844 --> 01:24:02.865
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal.

866
01:24:02.889 --> 01:24:05.409
- Ellis, listen to me very carefully.
- John -

867
01:24:05.433 --> 01:24:09.663
Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!
Put Hans back on the line.

868
01:24:09.687 --> 01:24:14.668
Hans, this shithead does not know what
kind of man you are, but I do. Listen -

869
01:24:14.692 --> 01:24:17.713
Good. Then you'll give us what we want
and save your friend's life.

870
01:24:17.737 --> 01:24:20.382
You're not part of this equation.
It's time you realized that.

871
01:24:20.406 --> 01:24:22.551
Hey, what am I,
a method actor, Hans?

872
01:24:22.575 --> 01:24:26.305
Babe, put away the gun.
This is radio, not television.

873
01:24:26.329 --> 01:24:28.974
Hans, this asshole is not my friend.
I just met him tonight.

874
01:24:28.998 --> 01:24:31.769
I don't know him. Jesus Christ, Ellis,
these people are gonna kill you!

875
01:24:31.793 --> 01:24:34.730
Tell them you don't know me!

876
01:24:34.754 --> 01:24:37.316
John, how can you say that
after all these years?

877
01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:42.093
John? John?

878
01:25:03.366 --> 01:25:06.428
Do you hear that?

879
01:25:06.452 --> 01:25:09.348
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

880
01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:11.975
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

881
01:25:11.999 --> 01:25:15.794
Sooner or later, I might get to someone
you do care about.

882
01:25:16.587 --> 01:25:18.880
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

883
01:25:20.299 --> 01:25:22.569
Did you hear that?
He just let the guy die, man.

884
01:25:22.593 --> 01:25:25.196
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

885
01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.199
- That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
- Christ, man.

886
01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:29.952
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

887
01:25:29.976 --> 01:25:31.954
- Is this on the right channel?
- Yes, sir.

888
01:25:31.978 --> 01:25:33.996
He did everything he could to save him.

889
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:36.250
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now.

890
01:25:36.274 --> 01:25:38.710
No way, man. No way.
They'd be talking to us.

891
01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:40.394
Listen, you tell this
partner of yours, pal,

892
01:25:40.418 --> 01:25:42.464
to stay the hell out of this
from now on, you hear me?

893
01:25:42.488 --> 01:25:43.230
Because if he doesn't,

894
01:25:43.254 --> 01:25:46.552
I'm gonna nail him. Boy, I'm really
gonna nail his ass now. Believe me.

895
01:25:46.576 --> 01:25:49.680
The man is hurtin'.
He is alone, tired...

896
01:25:49.704 --> 01:25:53.058
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody down here.

897
01:25:53.082 --> 01:25:55.060
Now, you're gonna
stand there and tell me...

898
01:25:55.084 --> 01:25:58.896
he's gonna give a damn about what you'll do
to him if he makes it out of there alive?

899
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.900
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

900
01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:03.902
You listen to me, Sergeant.

901
01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:07.156
Anytime you wanna go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

902
01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:10.868
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

903
01:26:10.892 --> 01:26:13.704
Attention, police.

904
01:26:13.728 --> 01:26:15.789
Attention, police.

905
01:26:15.813 --> 01:26:19.001
- This is Sergeant Al Powell -
- Give me that.

906
01:26:19.025 --> 01:26:22.588
This is, uh - This is, uh,
Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson. Who is this?

907
01:26:22.612 --> 01:26:25.756
This is Hans Gruber.

908
01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:28.594
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

909
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:30.971
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

910
01:26:30.995 --> 01:26:34.099
Well, uh, what is it you do wish for,
Mr. Gruber?

911
01:26:34.123 --> 01:26:38.686
I have comrades-in-arms
around the world languishing in prison.

912
01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:42.024
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

913
01:26:42.048 --> 01:26:45.694
Now it can rattle it for me.

914
01:26:45.718 --> 01:26:50.073
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

915
01:26:50.097 --> 01:26:53.160
In Northern Ireland,
the seven members of the New Provo Front.

916
01:26:53.184 --> 01:26:57.873
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Québec.

917
01:26:57.897 --> 01:27:00.516
In Sri Lanka, the nine members

918
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.693
- of the Asian Dawn movement.
- What the fuck?

919
01:27:05.446 --> 01:27:08.842
I read about them in Time magazine.

920
01:27:08.866 --> 01:27:12.512
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free...

921
01:27:12.536 --> 01:27:15.682
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof...

922
01:27:15.706 --> 01:27:20.145
and they will accompany us in helicopters
to the Los Angeles International Airport...

923
01:27:20.169 --> 01:27:22.272
where they will be given
further instructions.

924
01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:24.733
You have two hours to comply.

925
01:27:24.757 --> 01:27:28.320
Wait a minute.
Mr. Gruber, this is crazy.

926
01:27:28.344 --> 01:27:31.906
I-I-I don't have the authority. I can't
authorize - Two hours is not enough.

927
01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:34.159
H-Hello?

928
01:27:34.183 --> 01:27:36.411
Hello?

929
01:27:36.435 --> 01:27:39.748
Danny, did you get all that?
Let's go. We gotta make some calls.

930
01:27:39.772 --> 01:27:41.959
Do you think they'll
even try to do it?

931
01:27:41.983 --> 01:27:44.359
Who cares?

932
01:27:46.654 --> 01:27:48.632
Theo, are we on schedule?

933
01:27:48.656 --> 01:27:51.718
One more to go, then it's up to you.
And you better be right...

934
01:27:51.742 --> 01:27:54.179
because it looks like
this last one's gonna take a miracle.

935
01:27:54.203 --> 01:27:57.266
It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles.

936
01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:02.145
So be of good cheer and call me
when you hit the last lock.

937
01:28:02.169 --> 01:28:06.816
Karl, hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

938
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.986
Fritz is checking the explosives.

939
01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:11.780
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

940
01:28:11.804 --> 01:28:14.199
Hey, Powell, you out there?

941
01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:17.411
I'm here, John. I'm here.

942
01:28:17.435 --> 01:28:21.187
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

943
01:28:22.398 --> 01:28:25.085
Well, it's gonna be both
our asses if you're wrong.

944
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:27.569
I hear you.

945
01:28:32.992 --> 01:28:35.285
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

946
01:28:36.412 --> 01:28:39.056
It doesn't make sense, man.

947
01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.020
Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

948
01:28:43.044 --> 01:28:46.648
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

949
01:28:46.672 --> 01:28:49.860
In my youth. In my youth.

950
01:28:49.884 --> 01:28:55.073
And author of Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage: A Study in Duality.

951
01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:58.535
Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect
in the next few hours?

952
01:28:58.559 --> 01:29:02.164
Well, Gail, by this time the hostages
should be going through...

953
01:29:02.188 --> 01:29:04.708
the early stages
of the "Helsinki Syndrome."

954
01:29:04.732 --> 01:29:08.170
- As in Helsinki, Sweden.
- Finland.

955
01:29:08.194 --> 01:29:12.215
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists go through...

956
01:29:12.239 --> 01:29:16.803
a sort of psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.

957
01:29:16.827 --> 01:29:20.015
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.

958
01:29:20.039 --> 01:29:22.351
We've had situations
where the hostages...

959
01:29:22.375 --> 01:29:24.895
have embraced their captors
after their release...

960
01:29:24.919 --> 01:29:27.272
and even corresponded
with them in prison.

961
01:29:27.296 --> 01:29:29.816
No, no.
No, darling. "Asian Dawn."

962
01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.528
Dawn. D-A-W-N.

963
01:29:33.552 --> 01:29:35.530
- Sir?
- I - Yeah?

964
01:29:35.554 --> 01:29:38.450
- The FBI is here.
- Oh. The FBI is here now?

965
01:29:38.474 --> 01:29:40.452
Yes, sir, right over there.

966
01:29:40.476 --> 01:29:44.062
- Hold this.
- You want a breath mint?

967
01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:48.502
Uh, yeah. We got it.

968
01:29:48.526 --> 01:29:51.129
Hey! How you doing, man?

969
01:29:51.153 --> 01:29:53.673
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

970
01:29:53.697 --> 01:29:56.968
- Oh. How you doing?
- No relation.

971
01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:59.846
I'm, uh -

972
01:29:59.870 --> 01:30:03.725
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD
I'm in charge here.

973
01:30:03.749 --> 01:30:06.000
Not anymore.

974
01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:04.267
Hi, there. How you doing?

975
01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:10.041
Oh!

976
01:31:10.065 --> 01:31:15.172
Please, God, no. You're one of them,
aren't you? You're one of them.

977
01:31:15.196 --> 01:31:17.799
Don't - Don't kill me.
Please, don't. Please!

978
01:31:17.823 --> 01:31:20.552
- Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

979
01:31:20.576 --> 01:31:25.163
Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!

980
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:29.959
Oh, God.

981
01:31:32.755 --> 01:31:35.901
What the fuck are you doing up here?
What were you looking for?

982
01:31:35.925 --> 01:31:39.613
I managed to get out of there,
and, uh -

983
01:31:39.637 --> 01:31:41.906
Well, I was just trying
to get up on the roof...

984
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.869
and see if I could
signal for help, you know.

985
01:31:45.893 --> 01:31:47.954
It's just through here.
Why don't you come and help -

986
01:31:47.978 --> 01:31:51.666
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget the roof.
- Come on. Come on.

987
01:31:51.690 --> 01:31:56.171
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

988
01:31:56.195 --> 01:31:58.696
Come on. You wanna stay alive,
you stay with me.

989
01:32:01.367 --> 01:32:03.720
Well, the best way
we can figure it is...

990
01:32:03.744 --> 01:32:07.140
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there...

991
01:32:07.164 --> 01:32:09.142
probably on the 30th floor...

992
01:32:09.166 --> 01:32:12.771
and maybe, I don't know,
seven or eight terrorists up there.

993
01:32:12.795 --> 01:32:15.148
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

994
01:32:15.172 --> 01:32:17.234
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

995
01:32:17.258 --> 01:32:20.612
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

996
01:32:20.636 --> 01:32:23.323
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Such as?

997
01:32:23.347 --> 01:32:25.325
What about John McClane?

998
01:32:25.349 --> 01:32:28.536
He's the reason why we have
the information we have up until now.

999
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:32.249
He's also the reason why you're facing
seven terrorists instead of 12.

1000
01:32:32.273 --> 01:32:34.668
He's inside? Who is he?

1001
01:32:34.692 --> 01:32:37.629
Well, he might be a cop.
I don't know. We're checking on that.

1002
01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:40.571
- One of yours?
- No. No way.

1003
01:32:44.326 --> 01:32:47.036
Do you smoke?

1004
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:50.081
Yeah.

1005
01:32:54.628 --> 01:32:56.879
Thanks.

1006
01:33:00.426 --> 01:33:03.719
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1007
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:08.808
And if you're not one of them -

1008
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:13.437
I'm a cop from New York.

1009
01:33:14.773 --> 01:33:16.751
New York?

1010
01:33:16.775 --> 01:33:18.836
Yeah.

1011
01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:23.239
Got invited to the Christmas
party by mistake. Who knew?

1012
01:33:28.912 --> 01:33:31.766
Yeah.

1013
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:34.917
It's better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1014
01:33:41.884 --> 01:33:44.635
I'm John McClane.

1015
01:33:46.013 --> 01:33:47.763
You're, uh -

1016
01:33:48.724 --> 01:33:51.620
Clay.

1017
01:33:51.644 --> 01:33:53.811
Bill Clay.

1018
01:33:59.735 --> 01:34:02.028
You know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1019
01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:05.216
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1020
01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.636
You know that game
with the guns that shoot red paint?

1021
01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:11.037
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

1022
01:34:11.789 --> 01:34:14.040
Well...

1023
01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:17.668
time for the real thing, Bill.

1024
01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:29.805
All you gotta do
is pull the trigger. Come on.

1025
01:34:38.273 --> 01:34:40.691
33rd. floor. Come right away.

1026
01:34:48.992 --> 01:34:51.136
Put down the gun...

1027
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:53.537
and give me my detonators.

1028
01:34:57.793 --> 01:35:02.148
Well, well, well. Hans.

1029
01:35:02.172 --> 01:35:05.925
Put it down now.

1030
01:35:09.596 --> 01:35:13.118
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1031
01:35:13.142 --> 01:35:15.601
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1032
01:35:18.355 --> 01:35:22.085
But what do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

1033
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:26.464
I already used all the explosives.

1034
01:35:26.488 --> 01:35:28.698
Or did I?

1035
01:35:30.159 --> 01:35:32.220
- I'm going to count to three.
- Yeah.

1036
01:35:32.244 --> 01:35:34.889
Like you did with Takagi?

1037
01:35:34.913 --> 01:35:37.726
Oops.

1038
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:41.229
No bullets. You think
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1039
01:35:41.253 --> 01:35:43.629
You were saying?

1040
01:36:36.517 --> 01:36:39.536
Karl.

1041
01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.647
Shoot the Windows!

1042
01:36:47.486 --> 01:36:50.488
Shoot the glass.

1043
01:37:23.814 --> 01:37:26.023
Jesus Christ!

1044
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:57.555
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1045
01:38:00.017 --> 01:38:03.496
Is the last resort of diplomacy.

1046
01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.332
Then couldn't we just as well say...

1047
01:38:06.356 --> 01:38:09.168
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that too?

1048
01:38:09.192 --> 01:38:12.046
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

1049
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:14.924
Just McClane's name, badge number,
employment record...

1050
01:38:14.948 --> 01:38:17.594
vital statistics
and his family's home address...

1051
01:38:17.618 --> 01:38:20.138
right here in L.A.

1052
01:38:20.162 --> 01:38:22.955
Whoa!

1053
01:38:27.836 --> 01:38:29.689
Go to work.

1054
01:38:29.713 --> 01:38:31.964
Got it.

1055
01:38:43.769 --> 01:38:47.855
God, that man looks really pissed.

1056
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:53.880
- He's still alive.
- What?

1057
01:38:53.904 --> 01:38:58.157
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1058
01:39:12.798 --> 01:39:15.526
Hans.

1059
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:18.154
You better heat up that miracle, because
we just broke through on number six...

1060
01:39:18.178 --> 01:39:20.949
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1061
01:39:20.973 --> 01:39:26.518
Have a look at what our friends outside
are doing, and I'll be right up.

1062
01:39:28.730 --> 01:39:32.210
Hey, John?
John McClane, you still with us?

1063
01:39:32.234 --> 01:39:34.212
Yeah.

1064
01:39:34.236 --> 01:39:38.072
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1065
01:39:38.907 --> 01:39:41.594
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1066
01:39:41.618 --> 01:39:44.370
Well, the boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1067
01:39:45.247 --> 01:39:47.475
You know, we got
a pool going on you.

1068
01:39:47.499 --> 01:39:50.812
- What kind of odds am I gettin'?
- You don't want to know.

1069
01:39:50.836 --> 01:39:54.713
Put me down for 20.
I'm good for it.

1070
01:39:57.259 --> 01:40:00.719
Hey, Powell, you got flat feet?

1071
01:40:02.597 --> 01:40:04.659
What the hell
you talking about, man?

1072
01:40:04.683 --> 01:40:07.662
Something had to
get you off the street.

1073
01:40:07.686 --> 01:40:10.248
What's the matter? You don't think
jockeying papers across a desk...

1074
01:40:10.272 --> 01:40:13.023
is a noble effort for a cop?

1075
01:40:14.234 --> 01:40:16.485
No.

1076
01:40:18.739 --> 01:40:22.676
- I had an accident.
- The way you drive, I can see why.

1077
01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:26.537
What'd you do, run over
your captain's foot with a car?

1078
01:40:29.416 --> 01:40:31.583
I shot a kid.

1079
01:40:33.128 --> 01:40:36.606
He was 13 years old.

1080
01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:39.110
It was dark. I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun.

1081
01:40:39.134 --> 01:40:41.385
It looked real enough.

1082
01:40:43.472 --> 01:40:46.576
You know, when you're a rookie, they can
teach you everything about being a cop...

1083
01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.268
except how to live with a mistake.

1084
01:40:53.148 --> 01:40:57.484
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.

1085
01:41:00.989 --> 01:41:03.801
Sorry, man.

1086
01:41:03.825 --> 01:41:06.702
Hey, man, how could you know?

1087
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:11.915
I feel like shit anyway.

1088
01:41:13.293 --> 01:41:15.271
Well, then this won't matter.

1089
01:41:15.295 --> 01:41:20.257
The LAPD is not calling
the shots down here anymore.

1090
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:25.554
- Feds?
- You got it.

1091
01:41:26.848 --> 01:41:30.059
All right, those
are the city engineers.

1092
01:41:31.937 --> 01:41:33.915
They're going into
the street circuits.

1093
01:41:33.939 --> 01:41:36.766
Those guys in the suits -
I don't know who they are.

1094
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.233
That's the FBI

1095
01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.506
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1096
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:44.782
Regular as clockwork.

1097
01:41:46.243 --> 01:41:50.306
- Or a time lock.
- Precisely.

1098
01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:54.352
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically...

1099
01:41:54.376 --> 01:41:57.230
in response to a terrorist incident.

1100
01:41:57.254 --> 01:42:00.024
You asked for miracles, Theo.
I give you...

1101
01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:03.528
the FBI

1102
01:42:03.552 --> 01:42:05.295
I said I want the friggin'
building shut down.

1103
01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:07.115
- I got a problem.
- I don't care what your problem--

1104
01:42:07.139 --> 01:42:10.034
- I got a switch here -
- I don't give two shits about your switch!

1105
01:42:10.058 --> 01:42:13.162
- I want the building out. Dark. D-A-R-K!
- Hold on! You don't understand.

1106
01:42:13.186 --> 01:42:15.164
- You can't do it from here.
- Yeah, you could.

1107
01:42:15.188 --> 01:42:16.874
It can't be done from here.

1108
01:42:16.898 --> 01:42:17.932
I could just - I got the radio.

1109
01:42:17.956 --> 01:42:20.002
You can't do it from
down here I'm telling you.

1110
01:42:20.026 --> 01:42:22.296
It's gotta be done from downtown.

1111
01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.298
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1112
01:42:24.322 --> 01:42:26.843
- We're talking 10 square blocks.
- Ten blocks?

1113
01:42:26.867 --> 01:42:28.845
Johnson, that's crazy.
It's Christmas Eve, man.

1114
01:42:28.869 --> 01:42:32.473
- There's thousands of people.
- You have to go wider.

1115
01:42:32.497 --> 01:42:34.475
- I need authorization.
- Authorization?

1116
01:42:34.499 --> 01:42:36.284
How about the United
States fucking government?

1117
01:42:36.308 --> 01:42:37.353
Hey.

1118
01:42:37.377 --> 01:42:40.003
Lose the grid or you lose your job.

1119
01:42:46.094 --> 01:42:48.072
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1120
01:42:48.096 --> 01:42:51.616
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.
Say, listen.

1121
01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.580
Would it be possible
for you to turn off grid 212?

1122
01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:59.166
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe I should call the mayor.

1123
01:42:59.190 --> 01:43:02.253
No shit, it's my ass. I got a big problem
down here. Shut it down.

1124
01:43:02.277 --> 01:43:04.987
Shut it down now.

1125
01:43:07.407 --> 01:43:11.012
Emergency lighting activated.

1126
01:43:11.036 --> 01:43:13.530
Powell. Powell, talk to
me. What's going on here?

1127
01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:15.391
Ask the FBI.

1128
01:43:15.415 --> 01:43:18.226
They got the universal
terrorist playbook...

1129
01:43:18.250 --> 01:43:20.878
and they're running it step by step.

1130
01:43:22.797 --> 01:43:24.775
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1131
01:43:24.799 --> 01:43:28.177
Yes!

1132
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:52.951
Merry Christmas.

1133
01:43:54.829 --> 01:43:56.933
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants right now.

1134
01:43:56.957 --> 01:43:59.124
The mayor's gonna have my ass.

1135
01:44:06.132 --> 01:44:08.383
Whoo!

1136
01:44:20.230 --> 01:44:23.542
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1137
01:44:23.566 --> 01:44:26.045
Arrest them for not
paying their electric bill?

1138
01:44:26.069 --> 01:44:31.008
We've shut them down. We let 'em sweat
for a while, then we give 'em helicopters.

1139
01:44:31.032 --> 01:44:33.283
Right up the ass.

1140
01:44:36.079 --> 01:44:39.350
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.

1141
01:44:39.374 --> 01:44:42.520
I want that air support
ready to lift off in five minutes.

1142
01:44:42.544 --> 01:44:46.004
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1143
01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.804
Oh, yeah!

1144
01:44:55.557 --> 01:44:57.975
I wish to talk to the FBI

1145
01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.498
This is Special Agent Johnson
of the FBI

1146
01:45:02.522 --> 01:45:07.044
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.

1147
01:45:07.068 --> 01:45:09.839
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1148
01:45:09.863 --> 01:45:11.841
I hear you. We'll be ready.

1149
01:45:11.865 --> 01:45:14.593
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1150
01:45:14.617 --> 01:45:16.679
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1151
01:45:16.703 --> 01:45:18.723
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1152
01:45:18.747 --> 01:45:21.225
And by the time they figure out
what went wrong...

1153
01:45:21.249 --> 01:45:24.835
we'll be sitting on a beach
earning 20%.

1154
01:45:29.466 --> 01:45:32.736
Powell.

1155
01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.012
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1156
01:45:36.264 --> 01:45:38.473
I'm here, John.

1157
01:45:40.143 --> 01:45:43.622
Listen, man, I'm starting
to get a bad feeling up here.

1158
01:45:43.646 --> 01:45:45.875
I want you to do something for me.

1159
01:45:45.899 --> 01:45:48.544
Um -

1160
01:45:48.568 --> 01:45:52.756
I want you to find my wife.
Don't ask me how. By then, you'll know how.

1161
01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:57.303
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1162
01:45:57.327 --> 01:45:59.846
I want you to tell her that...

1163
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:02.122
um -

1164
01:46:06.127 --> 01:46:09.273
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1165
01:46:09.297 --> 01:46:13.258
what a jerk I've been, but, um -

1166
01:46:14.302 --> 01:46:16.553
but that -

1167
01:46:19.474 --> 01:46:22.078
that when things
started to pan out for her...

1168
01:46:22.102 --> 01:46:27.606
I should've been
more supportive, and, uh -

1169
01:46:28.942 --> 01:46:31.652
and I just should've been
behind her more.

1170
01:46:33.488 --> 01:46:36.573
Oh, shit.

1171
01:46:38.827 --> 01:46:42.098
Tell her that, um -

1172
01:46:42.122 --> 01:46:46.291
that she's the best thing that
ever happened to a bum like me.

1173
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:51.922
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1174
01:46:53.174 --> 01:46:55.592
She never heard me say, "I'm sorry."

1175
01:46:56.928 --> 01:47:00.825
And I want you to tell her that.
I want you to tell her that...

1176
01:47:00.849 --> 01:47:04.328
John said that he was sorry.

1177
01:47:04.352 --> 01:47:06.539
Okay?

1178
01:47:06.563 --> 01:47:10.107
- You got that, man?
- Yeah, I got it, John.

1179
01:47:11.192 --> 01:47:14.171
But you can tell her that yourself.

1180
01:47:14.195 --> 01:47:18.342
You just watch your ass and you'll
make it out of there. You hear me?

1181
01:47:18.366 --> 01:47:20.826
Well, I guess that's up
to the man upstairs.

1182
01:47:24.372 --> 01:47:28.310
John? John?

1183
01:47:28.334 --> 01:47:31.253
What the fuck were
you doing upstairs, Hans?

1184
01:47:33.548 --> 01:47:34.282
John?

1185
01:47:34.306 --> 01:47:37.926
No, Al, listen. Listen,
just lay off for a while.

1186
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.972
I gotta go check on something.

1187
01:47:45.059 --> 01:47:47.788
One minute.
That's all I'm asking.

1188
01:47:47.812 --> 01:47:50.541
One minute just to speak to you.
All right. All right.

1189
01:47:50.565 --> 01:47:54.086
All right. Get back.
Get back. Off. Off. All right.

1190
01:47:54.110 --> 01:47:57.381
Look, you let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S.

1191
01:47:57.405 --> 01:48:00.092
Comprende?

1192
01:48:00.116 --> 01:48:05.454
Look, this is the last time these kids
are gonna have to speak to their parents.

1193
01:48:07.332 --> 01:48:11.168
All right? All right.
Come on. Come on.

1194
01:48:21.638 --> 01:48:25.432
What were you doing, Hans?
What were you doing?

1195
01:48:47.455 --> 01:48:50.499
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1196
01:48:53.878 --> 01:48:56.106
Powell, listen to me!
It's a double cross!

1197
01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:58.715
The whole roof
of the building's wired to -

1198
01:49:01.177 --> 01:49:03.428
John.

1199
01:49:04.222 --> 01:49:06.200
John.

1200
01:49:06.224 --> 01:49:09.119
John, come in. Did you get that?

1201
01:49:09.143 --> 01:49:11.895
No. Something about a double cross.

1202
01:49:12.647 --> 01:49:14.856
Tell me about it.

1203
01:49:20.446 --> 01:49:22.781
We are both professionals.

1204
01:49:24.867 --> 01:49:27.805
This is personal.

1205
01:49:27.829 --> 01:49:30.455
Oh.

1206
01:49:50.018 --> 01:49:53.080
They're coming.

1207
01:49:53.104 --> 01:49:55.082
- Choppers are coming.
- Okay.

1208
01:49:55.106 --> 01:49:59.086
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1209
01:49:59.110 --> 01:50:01.505
You know, your mom
and dad are very important people.

1210
01:50:01.529 --> 01:50:04.842
They're very brave people.

1211
01:50:04.866 --> 01:50:08.410
So is there something you would like
to say to them if they're watching?

1212
01:50:09.245 --> 01:50:11.997
Come home.

1213
01:50:18.713 --> 01:50:21.798
Mrs. McClane.

1214
01:50:25.053 --> 01:50:29.014
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1215
01:50:31.726 --> 01:50:33.704
On your feet, everyone!
To the roof!

1216
01:50:33.728 --> 01:50:36.771
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1217
01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:40.692
Move! Come on! Let's move!

1218
01:51:05.093 --> 01:51:09.596
You should've heard your brother squeal
when I broke his fucking neck!

1219
01:51:12.642 --> 01:51:15.286
What do you figure the breakage?

1220
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:17.373
Figure we take out the terrorists...

1221
01:51:17.397 --> 01:51:21.085
lose 20-25% of the hostages... tops.

1222
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:23.629
I can live with that.

1223
01:51:23.653 --> 01:51:28.740
Keep this thing on the deck.
They're expecting transports, not gunships.

1224
01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:44.108
Move it! Come on! Move!
Come on! Come on!

1225
01:51:44.132 --> 01:51:46.694
Move it!

1226
01:51:46.718 --> 01:51:49.761
Let's go! Move!

1227
01:51:52.056 --> 01:51:54.993
Theo. A little bonus for us.

1228
01:51:55.017 --> 01:51:57.830
- Please, sit down. Sit down.
- Hey!

1229
01:51:57.854 --> 01:51:59.956
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1230
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.626
McClane, I have some news for you.

1231
01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:06.027
McClane.

1232
01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:18.331
Come on! Move, move!

1233
01:52:20.209 --> 01:52:22.419
Come on!

1234
01:52:33.806 --> 01:52:36.182
Motherfucker, I'll kill you!

1235
01:52:39.187 --> 01:52:42.416
Armed. The truck?

1236
01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:44.691
The truck.

1237
01:52:50.948 --> 01:52:54.678
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches...

1238
01:52:54.702 --> 01:52:57.346
you're nothing but a common thief.

1239
01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:00.142
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane.

1240
01:53:00.166 --> 01:53:03.626
And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.

1241
01:53:10.676 --> 01:53:12.863
Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!

1242
01:53:12.887 --> 01:53:16.598
I'm gonna fucking cook you,
and I'm gonna fucking eat you!

1243
01:53:38.955 --> 01:53:41.289
I don't like this, Sarge.

1244
01:53:51.759 --> 01:53:55.345
Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?

1245
01:53:56.597 --> 01:53:59.349
I was in junior high, dickhead.

1246
01:54:27.587 --> 01:54:30.440
Where's Holly?
Where's Holly Gennero?

1247
01:54:30.464 --> 01:54:34.194
Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1248
01:54:34.218 --> 01:54:35.863
- They took her!
- Where?

1249
01:54:35.887 --> 01:54:37.739
- The vault!
- Where is the vault?

1250
01:54:37.763 --> 01:54:42.369
The 30th floor. Up the stairs.
They just took her!

1251
01:54:42.393 --> 01:54:46.623
Get downstairs, all of you! The whole
fuckin' roof is wired to blow. Get down!

1252
01:54:46.647 --> 01:54:51.461
Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!

1253
01:54:51.485 --> 01:54:52.645
They made us, Bureau.

1254
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:55.196
- You got a terrorist shooting hostages.
- I see it. Bank left.

1255
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:05.415
Nail that sucker!

1256
01:55:12.173 --> 01:55:15.276
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1257
01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:18.636
Shit. Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1258
01:55:38.032 --> 01:55:40.783
What the fuck - Jesus!

1259
01:55:42.119 --> 01:55:44.514
Oh, John, what the fuck
are you doing?

1260
01:55:44.538 --> 01:55:47.498
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1261
01:55:56.968 --> 01:56:00.446
There's something wrong.
They're coming back down.

1262
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:02.866
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1263
01:56:02.890 --> 01:56:05.475
Blow the roof!

1264
01:56:07.395 --> 01:56:10.540
I promise I will never even think...

1265
01:56:10.564 --> 01:56:13.608
about going up
in a tall building again.

1266
01:56:16.570 --> 01:56:19.322
Oh, God.
Please don't let me die.

1267
01:56:31.585 --> 01:56:34.337
Holy shit!

1268
01:57:50.706 --> 01:57:53.499
Holy Christ!

1269
01:57:54.418 --> 01:57:57.170
We're gonna need some more
FBI guys, I guess.

1270
01:58:09.725 --> 01:58:12.060
Jesus fucking Christ!

1271
01:58:38.045 --> 01:58:40.797
What the fuck is going on?

1272
01:58:42.716 --> 01:58:46.386
What are you gonna do, sit here while
the building falls down around your ears?

1273
01:58:53.477 --> 01:58:55.288
Shit!

1274
01:58:55.312 --> 01:58:58.022
Hey! All right!

1275
01:59:01.152 --> 01:59:06.614
Hang on, baby.
Hang on, honey. Oh, God.

1276
01:59:51.493 --> 01:59:53.411
Hans!

1277
02:00:07.176 --> 02:00:09.529
Jesus.

1278
02:00:09.553 --> 02:00:11.929
Hi, honey.

1279
02:00:34.078 --> 02:00:36.056
So that's what this was all about?

1280
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:39.749
- A fucking robbery?
- Put down the gun.

1281
02:00:41.585 --> 02:00:43.563
Why did you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1282
02:00:43.587 --> 02:00:46.691
When you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1283
02:00:46.715 --> 02:00:49.819
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you...

1284
02:00:49.843 --> 02:00:52.322
unless they think
you're already dead.

1285
02:00:52.346 --> 02:00:54.555
Put down the gun.

1286
02:01:04.775 --> 02:01:08.380
Nein (No)! This is mine.

1287
02:01:08.404 --> 02:01:11.758
You got me.

1288
02:01:11.782 --> 02:01:14.469
Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.

1289
02:01:14.493 --> 02:01:16.805
Americans, all alike.
Well, this time...

1290
02:01:16.829 --> 02:01:20.266
John Wayne does not
walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1291
02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:22.185
That's Gary Cooper, asshole.

1292
02:01:22.209 --> 02:01:24.062
Enough jokes.

1293
02:01:24.086 --> 02:01:27.023
You'd have made a pretty good
cowboy yourself, Hans.

1294
02:01:27.047 --> 02:01:31.778
Oh, yes.
What was it you said to me before?

1295
02:01:31.802 --> 02:01:37.265
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

1296
02:01:56.327 --> 02:01:58.452
Holly!

1297
02:02:03.375 --> 02:02:06.419
Happy trails, Hans.

1298
02:02:49.170 --> 02:02:51.547
I hope that's not a hostage.

1299
02:03:19.952 --> 02:03:24.246
Give me water hook-ups for engine
companies five, three, nine, six.

1300
02:03:27.626 --> 02:03:30.271
Over here. It's a better angle.

1301
02:03:30.295 --> 02:03:33.005
Let's give 'em a hand over there.

1302
02:03:34.383 --> 02:03:36.842
Keep it going now.
Keep it going.

1303
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:44.119
Come on. Come on!
We're gonna miss it.

1304
02:03:44.143 --> 02:03:46.246
- Okay, hand me my notes.
- Come on!

1305
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:49.021
Keep that water on there.

1306
02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:11.938
What was it like in there? How did they
treat you? Did they frighten you at all?

1307
02:04:11.962 --> 02:04:14.274
- Any comment?
- We don't wanna talk about it.

1308
02:04:14.298 --> 02:04:17.800
How does it feel to be outside?

1309
02:04:59.050 --> 02:05:01.070
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1310
02:05:01.094 --> 02:05:03.364
Holly Gennero.

1311
02:05:03.388 --> 02:05:06.868
- Holly McClane.
- Hello, Holly.

1312
02:05:06.892 --> 02:05:11.122
You got yourself a good man.
You take good care of him.

1313
02:05:11.146 --> 02:05:13.208
- McClane?
- Yeah, it's okay. Let him through.

1314
02:05:13.232 --> 02:05:15.335
McClane, I wanna debrief.

1315
02:05:15.359 --> 02:05:19.172
I want a debriefing.
You got some things to answer for, mister.

1316
02:05:19.196 --> 02:05:22.258
Ellis's murder, for one thing.
Property damage.

1317
02:05:22.282 --> 02:05:24.617
Interfering with police business.

1318
02:06:04.783 --> 02:06:08.054
All right, I want two of you to go
inside and see if there's anybody else.

1319
02:06:08.078 --> 02:06:10.371
Yes, sir. I'll take the left.

1320
02:06:17.713 --> 02:06:21.423
- Watch it!
- Whoa. This one's with me.

1321
02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:31.536
Five, four, three, two.

1322
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:34.205
Mr. McClane. Mr. McClane,
now that it's all over...

1323
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:37.731
after this incredible ordeal,
what are your feelings?

1324
02:06:42.779 --> 02:06:45.133
Well, well, well.

1325
02:06:45.157 --> 02:06:48.117
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1326
02:06:50.996 --> 02:06:52.974
Did you get that?

1327
02:06:52.998 --> 02:06:56.102
Let me through.
Let me through. Thank you.

1328
02:06:56.126 --> 02:07:00.129
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
