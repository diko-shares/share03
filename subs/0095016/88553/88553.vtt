889
00:00:02,357 --> 00:00:05,508
Come back here!
Don't run! Come back!

890
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:07,946
Come back!

891
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:14,589
You guys, come on!

892
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:17,108
Benjamin, hurry up, please!

893
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:19,233
I had him and he got away!

894
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:20,830
Where's Baez?

895
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:24,515
Baez! Baez!
He ran off, did you see him?

896
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:25,632
What's he look like?

897
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:27,435
- I gave you the photo!
- I mean how tall is he?

898
00:00:27,597 --> 00:00:31,749
Medium-height, skinny... What are
they doing? He's getting away!

899
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:36,550
I can't take it, Benjamin.
What's he look like, he asks!

900
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:39,471
- He should have been there, not us!
- He doesn't know him, we do!

901
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:41,150
Why didn't you give him the photo?

902
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:44,115
Go to hell, you motherfucker!

903
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:00,149
Can't I take a crap in peace?

904
00:01:04,997 --> 00:01:05,986
Come out!

905
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:07,795
Fuck off! It's occupied!

906
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:11,795
Come on out, the cops are here.
Nothing will happen to you.

907
00:01:11,957 --> 00:01:14,027
What police?
Quit fucking around.

908
00:01:14,877 --> 00:01:15,946
Pablo!

909
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:27,194
Sorry. How's it going?

910
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:29,029
- I'm waiting for Sandoval.
- What for?

911
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:31,467
I play the nice guy,
then he comes in...

912
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:33,514
I'll explain later,
it's a routine we have.

913
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:36,908
Oldest trick in the book. You can't
question him without thejudge.

914
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:40,592
Actually, we have to pull it off
before he gets here.

915
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:42,873
Questioning a prisoner
with no lawyer or judge?

916
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,028
Ordoñez! You seen Sandoval?

917
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:47,833
- He left a while ago.
- Damn it.

918
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:50,113
It won't stand up.
What will you charge him with?

919
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,996
What do you mean?
You think it's little to go on?

920
00:02:53,157 --> 00:02:56,035
Looking at the victim in a photo?
Yes, it is.

921
00:02:56,197 --> 00:02:58,028
That's why we have to soften him up.

922
00:02:58,197 --> 00:02:59,312
What if it's not him?

923
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,308
- Don't look at me like that.
- Eduardo!

924
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:02,830
- What ifit's not him?
- Of course it is.

925
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:05,830
- Yes, Counselor?
- Don't call me that. Go get Sandoval.

926
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,273
- Should I take a taxi?
- Yes. No, no.

927
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,077
He goes to Robertino's
in the morning.

928
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:13,148
No. Wait, Eduardo.

929
00:03:13,317 --> 00:03:15,353
What are you doing?

930
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:16,154
Sorry, sorry.

931
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,271
It's him.

932
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:20,109
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

933
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:23,394
- See?
- I don't know how I know, but I know.

934
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:24,148
How?

935
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,710
Gomez, Isidoro Nestor.

936
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:38,306
I.D. Number.

937
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,786
10,740,925.

938
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:43,389
- Marital status?
- Single.

939
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,626
Address?

940
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:48,470
Mocoretá 2428, Isidro Casanova.

941
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,474
What train do you take into town?

942
00:03:55,997 --> 00:03:57,828
What train do you take into town?

943
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,951
I don't take the train.
I take the bus.

944
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:08,910
What's the problem?

945
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:13,947
Mo...

946
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:15,992
core...

947
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:19,585
This typewriter is no good.

948
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:23,906
The "A" doesn't work.

949
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:26,711
Wait, hold on.

950
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,748
What is this about?

951
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,755
Please, I beg you.

952
00:04:37,037 --> 00:04:42,111
You're implicated in the Liliana
Colotto case, rape and homicide.

953
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:45,633
It happened on June 21st, 1974.

954
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,708
Actually, you're the accused.

955
00:04:47,877 --> 00:04:50,266
I'm going to take your statement.

956
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,991
- You'll be assigned a public defender.
- Wait, wait, wait.

957
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,156
Liliana Colotto?

958
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:01,432
I knew her back in Chivilcoy.

959
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:03,551
What happened to her?

960
00:05:05,717 --> 00:05:07,116
Tell me, Gomez.

961
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:09,427
Why do you think you've spent 3 days

962
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:10,950
behind bars?

963
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:13,393
I have no idea.
I was at the match...

964
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:15,912
- Yeah, and you took off running.
- What would you do?

965
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:19,513
Two crazy-looking guys suddenly
jump you... What happened to Liliana?

966
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,230
Look, Gomez, don't...

967
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:25,070
You know as well as I do
you raped and killed her.

968
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:27,032
Liliana?

969
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,228
Are you serious?
I would never do that.

970
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,036
I haven't set foot in Chivilcoy
in over a year, I can prove it.

971
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:34,313
We looked for you
a week afterthe homicide

972
00:05:34,557 --> 00:05:36,707
and you disappeared,
from a hostal and a job.

973
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,345
What hostal?
I never left any hostal.

974
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:42,077
Gomez, don't play dumb.

975
00:05:42,237 --> 00:05:44,956
- The hostal on Piedras.
- That was a year ago!

976
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:48,075
I left because I couldn't afford it.

977
00:05:48,237 --> 00:05:51,149
- And your job?
- I found one that paid better.

978
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:53,349
What's that got to do with Liliana?

979
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:55,230
I've known her my whole life,

980
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,752
she's a friend from my childhood.

981
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,029
They can't find Sandoval.

982
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:17,308
- What?
- They can't fínd Sandoval.

983
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:23,037
Okay, let me think...

984
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:25,672
Listen.

985
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:29,386
Fortuna should be here any minute.
Please, wait for him.

986
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,036
Please, wait for him.

987
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:35,069
Yes, you could...

988
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:38,309
You could be right.

989
00:06:38,597 --> 00:06:40,076
It might be preferable...

990
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,751
more practical...
Let me see, one second.

991
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:54,786
Look, Gomez.

992
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:57,949
The judge handling your case

993
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:02,430
will be here soon,
so we're going to wait for him.

994
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,106
Ma'am?

995
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,917
Sorry to interrupt, deputy,
I mean, Counselor.

996
00:07:08,677 --> 00:07:10,269
I know you're handling this case.

997
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:12,072
But...

998
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,593
this kid couldn't have done it.

999
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:20,830
We'll talk outside.

1000
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:23,591
Wait, just a minute.
Look at him.

1001
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:27,676
This kid couldn't have done it.

1002
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,751
Let me see the autopsy.

1003
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:36,475
The Colotto girl...

1004
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,506
Here she is. 5 feet 6,

1005
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,635
128 pounds.

1006
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:43,515
Look what he did to her.

1007
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,396
I'm sorry, Gomez.

1008
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:48,629
But I don't buy it.

1009
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:50,909
The Amazon and the Pigmy?

1010
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:56,588
Besides, she was a beautiful woman.

1011
00:07:59,077 --> 00:08:00,271
Please,

1012
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:02,146
look at this face.

1013
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:07,194
A beauty like her
isn't within just anyone's reach.

1014
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:10,030
It takes a real man
to hook a woman like that.

1015
00:08:13,037 --> 00:08:14,789
You think so?

1016
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:16,626
I mean...

1017
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,713
The door wasn't forced.

1018
00:08:22,277 --> 00:08:24,916
That means she knew her assailant.

1019
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:26,827
Yes.

1020
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:31,796
But there's no way such a woman
would ever remember this twinkie.

1021
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,988
Unless she was a hooker.

1022
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,586
Some guys you only do for money.

1023
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:38,266
Who is she?

1024
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,029
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

1025
00:08:42,517 --> 00:08:45,987
No, she was a decent girl,
I assure you.

1026
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:50,073
I agree with the kid about that.

1027
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,705
She was two-timing that bank clerk
for sure.

1028
00:08:52,877 --> 00:08:57,667
I'll bet his horns were so big
he needed a convertible.

1029
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:00,196
What are you laughing at,
retard?

1030
00:09:01,157 --> 00:09:03,512
That guy who gave testimony
last time.

1031
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:06,710
- Sandoval?
- Right. I bet it was him.

1032
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:10,711
He was her lover.
Tall, good-looking, broad shoulders.

1033
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:13,949
A man truly capable of
warming up a woman.

1034
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:15,672
Look at this pussy.

1035
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,228
I'll bet when she saw him
she thought,

1036
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,070
"Oh, no, it's that schmuck
who always makes

1037
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,193
mushy faces in all the photos."

1038
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:26,791
Isn't that right?

1039
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:32,194
Yes or no?

1040
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:42,555
I caught you, motherfucker!

1041
00:09:44,077 --> 00:09:45,510
Get him out ofhere!

1042
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,186
I caught you!

1043
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,549
Take him away, please.

1044
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,396
You people are crazy.

1045
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:16,226
You're crazy.

1046
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:21,716
Listen, Benjamin.

1047
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:26,234
"The damage to the right
parietal bone

1048
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:30,595
demonstrates the assailant had
extraordinary upper body strength."

1049
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:33,067
Look.

1050
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:35,228
Two noodles.

1051
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:42,233
"Likewise, due to the depth
of her vaginal injuries,

1052
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:46,595
we may deduce that the assailant
was very well-endowed."

1053
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:51,349
Obviously they're not talking about
this microbe. He must have a peanut.

1054
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,556
There it is, bitch.

1055
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:11,469
How do you like it?

1056
00:11:24,077 --> 00:11:25,112
Sweetheart,

1057
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,635
you'll never reach the piñata.
First, you're too short.

1058
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,795
Second, you're not man enough
for a real woman like me.

1059
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:33,506
Not man enough?

1060
00:11:33,677 --> 00:11:34,507
Fucking bitch!

1061
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,589
I fucked the shit out of her!
I fucked the shit out of her!

1062
00:11:37,757 --> 00:11:38,826
That bitch!

1063
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,916
I fucked her brains out!

1064
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,466
Stop, stop, let him go...

1065
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:47,507
Let him go, Benjamin.

1066
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:49,190
Let go of me!

1067
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:51,632
Touch her and I'll kill you.
I'll kill you!

1068
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:00,152
Let go of me!

1069
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:46,475
Are you Esposito?

1070
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:51,312
Are you Esposito or not?

1071
00:13:02,957 --> 00:13:05,755
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me. Did I wake you?

1072
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:07,910
No, I was...

1073
00:13:08,397 --> 00:13:11,070
working a bit.
Why are you up so late?

1074
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,390
I was thinking...

1075
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:15,832
- You don't say.
- Yeah, silly.

1076
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,275
No, about the novel.

1077
00:13:18,437 --> 00:13:20,746
I want to read ¡t when
it's finished.

1078
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:24,350
Great, I'd love that.

1079
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:27,992
Sure you don't want to talk
a little while?

1080
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:31,229
No, I'll drink my tea
and see if I can get back to sleep.

1081
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:32,912
Okay.

1082
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:34,676
- Bye.
- Bye.

1083
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:44,748
Irene, the dressmaker is here.

1084
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,033
Look, she made the cape
like you wanted.

1085
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:48,550
Come and try it on.

1086
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,232
I'll be right in.

1087
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:24,786
Hello?

1088
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:28,236
Morales, how are you?
It's been ages, what a surprise!

1089
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:33,434
Yeah, I'm watching it,
but I turned it down.

1090
00:14:34,637 --> 00:14:35,752
What?

1091
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:38,985
What?

1092
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:48,471
And also, thanks to them,
we can achieve

1093
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,515
many things, because people
can't do it all on their own.

1094
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:06,033
Good morning. Miss Menendez Hastings
from Court 42.

1095
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,949
We're here to see Mr. Romano.

1096
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,631
He's very busy.
What's it about?

1097
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,670
Sir! Sir! You can't go in there!

1098
00:15:14,117 --> 00:15:15,869
I'll leave my credentials,
don't worry.

1099
00:15:16,037 --> 00:15:18,915
These two, raising their hands.
I want you to get them.

1100
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:21,388
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

1101
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,070
No, you are.

1102
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,708
- Ma'am.
- We need to talk to you.

1103
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:27,716
Fellas, would you mind?

1104
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:35,989
If you'd called first,
I'd have had coffee ready.

1105
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:41,032
Isidoro Gomez. Rape and murder,
arrested by the court.

1106
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:42,869
Penitentiaries informed us

1107
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:45,551
he's been freed by Executive Order.
We checked...

1108
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,787
and here we are.
Anything to say?

1109
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,266
Yeah, sure. That you two
need to get out more.

1110
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,193
Justice is nothing but an island.
This is the real world.

1111
00:15:54,517 --> 00:15:57,429
While you two are shooting birds,
we're in here,

1112
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,713
fighting in the middle
of thejungle.

1113
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,790
Gomez, Gomez, Gomez...
Yes.

1114
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:06,630
He started working for us
when he was in jail.

1115
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,550
He'd give us information,
spy on young guerrillas...

1116
00:16:09,717 --> 00:16:11,753
He did good work.
We like him.

1117
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,191
What's the problem?

1118
00:16:14,677 --> 00:16:18,352
Do you realize what you're saying?
He confessed. He's a convicted

1119
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:19,427
murderer.

1120
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:22,589
Perhaps, but he's also
intelligent and brave.

1121
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,192
He can break into a home
and get the job done.

1122
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,590
His personal life
is his own business, right?

1123
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:31,396
With all the subversives
out there... Who cares?

1124
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,554
If we only used good guys...

1125
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:40,834
He was arrested under
Judge Fortuna's jurisdiction...

1126
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:44,467
Do you think I don't know you let
him go to get back at me?

1127
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,865
You think I'm stupid?

1128
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:49,868
That's two questions.
Which one shall I answer fírst?

1129
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,232
- Is that true?
- Ma'am...

1130
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,151
Would you do me a favor?

1131
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,546
Stay out of it.

1132
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,267
What are you gonna do,
file an appeal?

1133
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,428
No offense, but there's nothing
you can do.

1134
00:17:01,597 --> 00:17:05,146
Except go back to your office,
take a seat, and watch and learn.

1135
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,547
They don't teach the new Argentina
at Harvard.

1136
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,188
And why do you come with her?

1137
00:17:13,757 --> 00:17:15,793
You think it gives you immunity?

1138
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:19,314
Leave her alone,
she's out of your league.

1139
00:17:20,197 --> 00:17:23,712
She studied law, you barely finished
high school. She's young, you're old.

1140
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,833
She's rich, you're poor.

1141
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:27,795
She's Menendez Hastings

1142
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,868
and you're Esposito, a zero.

1143
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:32,631
She's untouchable, you aren't.

1144
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,667
Let her go back to her world.

1145
00:17:37,277 --> 00:17:39,632
But if you have a problem with me,

1146
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:42,870
come alone and we'll settle it.

1147
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:49,270
Come on, Irene.

1148
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,025
Let's go.

1149
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,434
You do have one thing in common.

1150
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:00,630
Neither of you
can do a thing about it.

1151
00:19:21,557 --> 00:19:23,036
You said life.

1152
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,317
Yes, he should get life.

1153
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,071
Well, then?

1154
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:34,789
These people don't give a shit
about justice.

1155
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:40,066
And where he is now,
we can't get anywhere near him.

1156
00:19:44,557 --> 00:19:46,070
Ifl could, what for?

1157
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:49,470
What would I do?
What would four bullets get me?

1158
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:51,352
A lifetime in jail.

1159
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:55,826
Gomez goes free without ever serving
and I spend 50 years

1160
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,989
stuck in a cell, envying him.

1161
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:01,712
No.

1162
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,228
No, life in prison
would have been fair.

1163
00:20:10,357 --> 00:20:13,713
I wish I could help,
but I honestly don't know how.

1164
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:18,836
Who knows?

1165
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:21,435
Some othertime...

1166
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:27,712
Anyway.

1167
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,956
- I'll get it.
- No, please.

1168
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:31,232
It's just a coffee.

1169
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,311
I'm very grateful for everything
you've done for me.

1170
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:41,631
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

1171
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:44,985
I owe you one.

1172
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:16,675
Counselor, sir.
It's about the lgarzabal fíle, sir.

1173
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:19,670
Stop calling me Counselor,
would you already?

1174
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:22,346
If you do it in front of the judge
I'll get in trouble.

1175
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,711
What about the fíle?

1176
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:25,754
- Have you made a copy?
- I'm on it.

1177
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:26,667
No, you aren't.

1178
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:29,590
You'd have to be there,
but you're here.

1179
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:34,666
Benjamin.

1180
00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:38,912
Yes?

1181
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:43,626
How long before
you talk to me again?

1182
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:45,550
I talk to you every day.

1183
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:50,076
I'm not untouchable.

1184
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:54,195
- Or from another world.
- Lf only you were...

1185
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:58,115
- Irene, let's drop it.
- Drop what?

1186
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:01,036
You're marrying the engineer,
Zapiola

1187
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,711
Menendez Urtubiea and so on.

1188
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:07,592
You're notjealous...

1189
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:12,467
For God's sake.
I hope you live happily ever after.

1190
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:14,593
- Any objections?
- No, none.

1191
00:22:14,757 --> 00:22:15,746
Go on, object.

1192
00:22:17,677 --> 00:22:18,905
Irene,

1193
00:22:19,357 --> 00:22:20,426
please.

1194
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,707
What are you looking at?
What do you want? Go away.

1195
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:24,946
Come on.

1196
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:29,708
- Where can we meet?
- What for?

1197
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:33,114
So you can present your objections
about my life, my fíancé,

1198
00:22:33,277 --> 00:22:35,632
my marriage and anything else
related to the case.

1199
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:41,315
We can meet for coffee after work.

1200
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,272
Time?

1201
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:48,476
Eight-thirty. Place?

1202
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,514
- The lmmortals.
- The Richmond.

1203
00:22:50,957 --> 00:22:54,108
Sorry. My suggestion
wasn't very elegant.

1204
00:22:55,397 --> 00:22:57,672
No, Benjamin.
Somewhere far from here.

1205
00:23:02,717 --> 00:23:03,991
Who are you spying on?

1206
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:07,274
Sorry. Phone call for you, sir.
From a bar?

1207
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:12,270
Pablo Sandoval.
You cocksucking bastard.

1208
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:13,995
Wash your fucking mouth!

1209
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:18,026
No, Benjamin...
I can't believe they called you.

1210
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,107
What happened?

1211
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:21,871
I told everyone
not to bother my friend.

1212
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:23,550
This is a man'sjob!

1213
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,992
You're not a man,
you stinking drunk.

1214
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,955
What? Me, drunk?
Fuck you! Fascist!

1215
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,585
Fascist! He's a Nazi!

1216
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:32,985
He's a Nazi!

1217
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:37,515
Listen, offícer.
We're from Court 42, I'll handle it.

1218
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,156
- Come with me.
- Arrest them!

1219
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:43,430
Arrest the motherfuckers!
Show them some fucking justice!

1220
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,270
- Fuck you!
- My jacket! My jacket!

1221
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,790
You're wearing it.

1222
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:02,026
What time does your wife get home?

1223
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,272
At eight.

1224
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,556
How odd. There's no answer.

1225
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,828
My mouth is dry.

1226
00:24:09,837 --> 00:24:11,668
Have you got any?

1227
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:13,950
There's no answer.

1228
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:15,547
Leave that alone.

1229
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,828
She's never going to answer.

1230
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:19,346
Why?

1231
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:20,916
Because the phone doesn't work.

1232
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:22,715
What do you mean?
Put that down.

1233
00:24:23,397 --> 00:24:25,308
I told you a thousand times,
Benjamin.

1234
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,833
I wanted to sue their asses.

1235
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,153
And you didn't help me.

1236
00:24:30,317 --> 00:24:32,228
That was 6 months ago.

1237
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:36,466
The phone hasn't worked for a year.
They never fixed it.

1238
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,832
You can't spend the night here.

1239
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,029
Put that down.
Stop touching stuff.

1240
00:24:42,117 --> 00:24:46,156
If you ever called me,
you'd know it doesn't work.

1241
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:48,626
Leave that.
What are you looking for?

1242
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,355
I wanted to sue them.

1243
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:53,466
Look at me.

1244
00:24:54,037 --> 00:24:56,267
- You have a date?
- No, no.

1245
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:58,833
You have a date.
And I'm leaving.

1246
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,069
The last thing I need
is you calling me a party pooper.

1247
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,306
Too much furniture in here.

1248
00:25:05,477 --> 00:25:08,230
- Sit here.
- I always run into shit.

1249
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:10,957
Have a seat until you feel better.

1250
00:25:11,117 --> 00:25:12,755
Have a seat.

1251
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:14,226
What time is it?

1252
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:18,231
- I have a watch in the bedroom.
- What bedroom? This is my house.

1253
00:25:18,837 --> 00:25:20,987
We're doing great. Just great.

1254
00:25:21,157 --> 00:25:23,466
- Take it easy.
- We're doing great.

1255
00:25:23,877 --> 00:25:26,914
I'll try to convince your wife
not to kill you.

1256
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:28,910
Call her on the phone.

1257
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:31,430
You said it didn't work.

1258
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,273
Mine doesn't work, Benjamin.

1259
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,756
Use yours.

1260
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:46,746
Just stay here. Don't touch
anything, don't do anything.

1261
00:25:47,357 --> 00:25:48,756
I'll be right back.

1262
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:52,033
- Turn off the light.
- Yes.

1263
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:56,517
We'll catch that son of a bitch.

1264
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:58,633
We'll catch him.

1265
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:06,275
- We were working all day.
- Save it, some othertime.

1266
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:07,472
Let me explain.

1267
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:10,071
- It's the last time.
- Okay, okay.

1268
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,626
You could have remembered as well.

1269
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,913
Be patient with him, he needs help.

1270
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:18,074
He needs help?

1271
00:26:18,237 --> 00:26:21,070
What I mean is if we help him,
it's easier for everyone.

1272
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,030
You want to get rid of him.

1273
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:24,346
Don't say that.

1274
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:28,592
What's this?

1275
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:31,187
- What happened?
- Hold on a second.

1276
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:38,426
Pablo?

1277
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,952
- What is it?
- I don't know. Pablo?

1278
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:43,073
- Don't scare me.
- Wait there.

1279
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:45,752
Pablo...

1280
00:26:49,237 --> 00:26:51,467
- No!
- What is it? What happened?

1281
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,229
What happened?

1282
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,630
This is madness.

1283
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,913
It will be if that bastard
finds you.

1284
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:24,752
- He's gonna go after you.
- No, my father knows who to talk to.

1285
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:28,227
He works for Romano, Romano
won't mess with me. I'll be fíne.

1286
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,308
But Jujuy?
For God's sake, Irene.

1287
00:27:30,477 --> 00:27:33,594
My cousins are like feudal
lords there. Nobody will touch you.

1288
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:36,032
What will I do in Jujuy?

1289
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:39,348
Same as here. Sign and stamp.
They have your desk ready.

1290
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:43,829
I can't. I have my life here,
I have my old man here,

1291
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,952
I have...

1292
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,665
I have everything here.

1293
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:55,630
What can we do...

1294
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,072
here?

1295
00:27:58,157 --> 00:27:59,351
Us.

1296
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,752
I mean,

1297
00:28:02,717 --> 00:28:03,866
you and me.

1298
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,430
There's nothing we can do.

1299
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:49,226
Ciao.

1300
00:30:29,677 --> 00:30:31,269
It's a rough draft.

1301
00:30:34,397 --> 00:30:35,546
I'll make more.

1302
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:42,189
Your house is exactly
as I imagined it.

1303
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,393
How did you imagine it?

1304
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:47,870
Exactly like this.
Exactly like I imagined it.

1305
00:30:48,197 --> 00:30:52,190
Sure, I imagined your house
would be totally different.

1306
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,155
You've seen my house?

1307
00:30:54,317 --> 00:30:56,148
No, I mean unlike this.

1308
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:57,876
Totally different.

1309
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,630
What does this mean?

1310
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:06,786
This piece of paper says
"I FEAR."

1311
00:31:07,237 --> 00:31:10,707
No, it'sjust something I did...

1312
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:14,472
a writing exercise...
half asleep...

1313
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:17,071
to inspire the imagination...
Never mind.

1314
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:19,275
Okay, shoot.

1315
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,716
It's a novel.

1316
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:27,390
It doesn't have to be true,

1317
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:29,946
or even believable.

1318
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:32,312
Yes. No. What?
It isn't believable?

1319
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:36,556
No, Benjamin.
That part when...

1320
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:38,831
when the guy leaves for Jujuy...

1321
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,270
- What's the problem?
- Crying like he's all broken up...

1322
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:46,868
Her running on the platform
after the man of her dreams...

1323
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:50,035
Touching hands through the glass
like they're one.

1324
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:51,676
- That's what happened.
- And her crying,

1325
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,511
like she knew her fate
was mediocrity

1326
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:55,792
and never loving anyone,

1327
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:58,027
practically falling on the tracks,

1328
00:31:58,197 --> 00:32:01,269
proclaiming love she'd never had
the courage to confess...

1329
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:03,189
That's what happened.
Isn't it?

1330
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:08,585
If that's what happened,

1331
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,628
why didn't you take me with you?

1332
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,071
Dimwit.

1333
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:48,032
How does the case proceed?

1334
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:52,028
I don't know. I can say

1335
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:55,553
he spent 10 years
counting llamas in the Andes.

1336
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:58,873
And when I came back
you were D.A.,

1337
00:32:59,397 --> 00:33:01,831
married and with two kids.
Should I put that?

1338
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:07,753
Orthat he came back married
to a rich little Jujuyan princess.

1339
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:09,265
She was wonderful.

1340
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:12,756
It wasn't her fault
I could never love her.

1341
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,826
It's a lousy ending.

1342
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,032
It's crap.

1343
00:33:21,837 --> 00:33:22,906
You see?

1344
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:26,826
I don't want to miss another chance.
How is it possible?

1345
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:29,030
How can I do nothing about it?

1346
00:33:29,197 --> 00:33:30,266
I've been asking myself

1347
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:33,907
for 25 years and I've only been able
to come up with one answer.

1348
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:37,353
"Forget it, it was another lifetime.
It's over, don't ask."

1349
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:40,317
It wasn't another lifetime.
It was this one.

1350
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:43,389
It is this one.

1351
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:45,275
Now I want to understand.

1352
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:47,473
How can someone live an empty life?

1353
00:33:47,637 --> 00:33:50,549
How do you live a life
full of nothing?

1354
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:52,751
How do you do it?

1355
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,875
This is a waste of time.
We'll never find him.

1356
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,232
Trust me,
remember how formal he was?

1357
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:05,195
Nobody notifies a change of address.
Mine's from when I danced the pata-pata.

1358
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:06,947
Excuse me.

1359
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:09,075
Gomez, Isidoro. Espora 691,

1360
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:12,354
- province of Chivilcoy.
- You see? That's his mother.

1361
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:17,908
Sir, we are required by law
to notify a change of address.

1362
00:34:18,277 --> 00:34:20,996
It's not something we do because
we feel like it. Understand?

1363
00:34:21,157 --> 00:34:23,034
- I do now.
- Morales, Ricardo.

1364
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:25,552
There's one, two...
Four, ma'am.

1365
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,435
Let's search by I.D. Number.

1366
00:34:27,597 --> 00:34:30,031
- What's your fírst number?
- Three, what's yours?

1367
00:34:31,077 --> 00:34:33,432
- What do you care?
- What? Can't I?

1368
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:38,035
Here's a 5 and a 6.
Morales, Ricardo Augustin.

1369
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:41,517
He changed addresses in 1975.

1370
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,948
Write this down, pata-pata.

1371
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,390
Who are you looking for?

1372
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:05,192
Morales.

1373
00:36:06,437 --> 00:36:08,234
How are you? Remember me?

1374
00:36:08,997 --> 00:36:10,112
Esposito.

1375
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:13,075
From the courts... 25 years ago.

1376
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:20,916
- Quite a surprise.
- I know, sorry.

1377
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:32,749
- How are you?
- Hello.

1378
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,871
Long time.

1379
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:41,076
What a surprise.

1380
00:36:41,237 --> 00:36:42,226
Yeah.

1381
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:49,394
Come in.

1382
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:51,750
Shall I make coffee?

1383
00:36:52,237 --> 00:36:53,431
Coffee?

1384
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:56,067
You're not drinking maté out here?

1385
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:58,195
Out here?

1386
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:00,746
I'm at the bank all day long.

1387
00:37:01,237 --> 00:37:02,511
You're still at the bank?

1388
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:04,516
I'll take that coffee.

1389
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,314
You moved out here right after.

1390
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:15,073
Yes. I wanted to start over,
from scratch.

1391
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:19,672
That's the good thing
about the bank.

1392
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:21,190
They have branches everywhere.

1393
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:24,989
There's always a branch nobody
wants, so here I am,

1394
00:37:25,317 --> 00:37:27,069
with a promotion and everything.

1395
00:37:27,517 --> 00:37:28,745
How about that.

1396
00:37:36,477 --> 00:37:37,796
Remember Liliana?

1397
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:41,386
Yes, of course.

1398
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:50,430
How are you doing?

1399
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:52,545
Still here.

1400
00:37:53,997 --> 00:37:55,510
No, I mean single,

1401
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:57,747
- married...
- No.

1402
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,145
No, really.

1403
00:37:59,597 --> 00:38:02,316
I think I just... at that point...

1404
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,036
just closed shop.

1405
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:08,025
I tried, but you know what?

1406
00:38:09,717 --> 00:38:11,070
It's complicated.

1407
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,308
- I got married.
- You don't say.

1408
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:16,036
Yeah, for a while.

1409
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:18,716
But it didn't work.

1410
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,711
I don't know ifit was me...

1411
00:38:23,077 --> 00:38:24,146
It's complicated.

1412
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,545
It's complicated.

1413
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,554
Quite a story.

1414
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:37,756
I can't believe it.

1415
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:39,988
Neverthought I had a novel in me.

1416
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:43,752
You should flesh it out.
It's like a long memo.

1417
00:38:44,277 --> 00:38:45,471
Crazy.

1418
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:47,468
I could never forget it.

1419
00:38:47,637 --> 00:38:50,674
A mistake.
You should put it behind you.

1420
00:38:51,317 --> 00:38:52,545
Trust me.

1421
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,313
You came here because of Gomez,
right?

1422
00:38:58,717 --> 00:39:00,070
What do you mean?

1423
00:39:00,357 --> 00:39:03,030
He was on the loose,
he might come looking for you.

1424
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:06,186
No, no.

1425
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:09,348
I'm not scared of Gomez.

1426
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,067
Maybe he's dead.

1427
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:13,671
Maybe.

1428
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:23,109
They came looking for me.

1429
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:24,831
Yes, I know.

1430
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:28,787
- How do you know?
- I just read it.

1431
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:31,596
- They found your friend.
- Oh, right.

1432
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:34,150
Poor Sandoval.

1433
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:35,716
Do you remember Sandoval?

1434
00:39:35,877 --> 00:39:36,912
No.

1435
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:38,989
My coworker at the courts.

1436
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:43,272
They came looking for me,
didn't fínd me

1437
00:39:43,557 --> 00:39:45,036
and let him have it.

1438
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:46,796
Bastards.

1439
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:51,395
Gomez was never found, right?

1440
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:52,626
Guess.

1441
00:39:56,517 --> 00:39:58,792
Those guys always get away with it.

1442
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:06,628
You know, there's something
I need to ask you.

1443
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:11,112
How did you learn to live
without Liliana?

1444
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:15,154
It was 25 years ago, Esposito.

1445
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:16,796
I was sure you wouldn't be able to.

1446
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,346
- It was 25 years ago, Esposito.
- Especially with him on the loose.

1447
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,030
How did you start over?

1448
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:23,188
It was 25 years ago!

1449
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:25,346
Forget it.

1450
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,670
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't have made it this far.

1451
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,430
Rememberthat?

1452
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:44,905
You owe me one.

1453
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:48,347
I don't know what you want me
to say.

1454
00:40:48,517 --> 00:40:50,985
You didn't care
the guy got a free ride.

1455
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,385
There was nothing I could do.

1456
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:58,150
You spent a year looking forthe guy,
they let him go and you do nothing?

1457
00:40:58,317 --> 00:41:00,877
I wasted a year looking for him
and they let him go!

1458
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:02,550
- What can I do?
- That's it?

1459
00:41:02,717 --> 00:41:04,469
- Yes!
- The rest of your life behind a desk?

1460
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,355
- Look who's talking.
- You're better than I am.

1461
00:41:07,397 --> 00:41:08,955
What do you care?

1462
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:12,675
- It's my life, not yours.
- No, Morales.

1463
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,350
It's my life too.

1464
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:18,149
Your love forthat woman...
I never saw it again.

1465
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:19,306
In anybody.

1466
00:41:20,957 --> 00:41:22,106
Nobody.

1467
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,066
Ever.

1468
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:29,556
Get out of my house.

1469
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,676
Right now, please.

1470
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:38,192
It's my life, not yours.

1471
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:46,112
I'm sorry.

1472
00:41:46,277 --> 00:41:47,312
I'm...

1473
00:41:50,997 --> 00:41:52,749
getting old, that's it.

1474
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:56,911
That might be it.

1475
00:42:02,477 --> 00:42:04,308
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1476
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:06,354
Go dwell on it at home.

1477
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:25,109
Gomez didn't kill Sandoval.

1478
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,792
So?

1479
00:42:28,637 --> 00:42:30,468
He knew us both.

1480
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:33,390
If he'd been there,
he'd have waited for me.

1481
00:42:37,797 --> 00:42:38,991
There's something...

1482
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:42,147
I had a couple of photos at home,
of myself.

1483
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:45,385
When Sandoval got killed,

1484
00:42:46,637 --> 00:42:48,389
the photos had been turned over.

1485
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,626
Nothing else had been touched.

1486
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:53,711
I thought...

1487
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:56,865
I think...

1488
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:15,956
Are you Esposito?

1489
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:23,674
Did you hear what I said, asshole?
Are you Esposito?

1490
00:43:28,477 --> 00:43:30,627
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

1491
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:33,666
Answer me.

1492
00:43:36,357 --> 00:43:38,154
Where are you going?

1493
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:39,952
Where are you going?

1494
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,790
- Here.
- What are you going to do?

1495
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:47,031
I'm going to put on a record.
It's okay.

1496
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:49,796
A record?

1497
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:51,546
Listen to me.

1498
00:43:52,717 --> 00:43:54,787
Are you Esposito or not?

1499
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:03,226
Yes, I am.

1500
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:43,793
I'm so ashamed I can't even bring
myself to put flowers on his grave.

1501
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:50,954
Maybe that's not what happened.

1502
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,191
Maybe he fell asleep and they
killed him without him even realizing,

1503
00:44:58,557 --> 00:45:00,354
somebody knocked over the photos

1504
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,906
by accident, bumped into them...

1505
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:05,386
I don't know.

1506
00:45:06,317 --> 00:45:08,592
I don't know what to think anymore.

1507
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:10,950
Choose carefully.

1508
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:14,348
Memories are all we end up with.

1509
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:16,994
At least pick the nice ones.

1510
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:21,350
But there's one thing

1511
00:45:21,517 --> 00:45:23,508
I know I'll never forget.

1512
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,589
The last thing Pablo said to me
the night they killed him.

1513
00:45:27,877 --> 00:45:29,913
"Don't worry, Benjamin.

1514
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:32,233
We'll catch that son of a bitch."

1515
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,510
And I will.

1516
00:45:37,637 --> 00:45:39,389
Lfhe's alive, I will.

1517
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:47,992
Wait.

1518
00:45:51,197 --> 00:45:52,949
Come in, sit down.

1519
00:46:04,557 --> 00:46:06,195
You can stop looking.

1520
00:46:08,197 --> 00:46:09,869
I couldn't go to the authorities.

1521
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:12,068
I knew the guy was untouchable.

1522
00:46:13,877 --> 00:46:16,675
But I also knew sooner or later
he'd come looking...

1523
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:19,436
for you.

1524
00:46:56,477 --> 00:46:57,910
Hey, Gomez!

1525
00:47:41,637 --> 00:47:45,550
I got rid of the body
and obviously he wasn't missed.

1526
00:47:59,357 --> 00:48:00,506
Was it worth it?

1527
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:03,830
Forget about it.

1528
00:48:04,237 --> 00:48:05,670
Forget it.

1529
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,070
Who cares?

1530
00:48:08,997 --> 00:48:10,396
My wife is dead.

1531
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:11,990
Your friend is dead.

1532
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:13,954
Gomez is dead too.
They're all dead.

1533
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:15,948
Stop dwelling on it.

1534
00:48:16,117 --> 00:48:19,029
You'll start wondering
if you could have stopped it...

1535
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:21,871
You'll have a thousand pasts
and no future.

1536
00:48:23,837 --> 00:48:25,555
Forget about it, trust me.

1537
00:48:27,477 --> 00:48:29,593
You'll end up with only memories.

1538
00:48:34,117 --> 00:48:35,550
I owed you one, right?

1539
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,356
Now we're even.

1540
00:49:01,077 --> 00:49:02,556
Forget about it.

1541
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:06,590
Forget it.

1542
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:09,348
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

1543
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,309
What would four bu/lets getme?

1544
00:49:17,197 --> 00:49:18,630
It's my life,

1545
00:49:19,517 --> 00:49:20,632
not yours.

1546
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:22,151
Go dwell on it at home.

1547
00:49:23,357 --> 00:49:24,870
We'll catch him.

1548
00:49:26,437 --> 00:49:28,997
I've been wondering for 25 years.

1549
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:31,266
Ciao.

1550
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,346
It wasn't another l¡fetime.
It was this one.

1551
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:39,190
A guy can do anything
to be different.

1552
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:41,635
What would four bullets get me?

1553
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:45,790
But there's one thing he can't change.
Not him, not you, not anybody.

1554
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:32,076
How can someone live
an empty life?

1555
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:41,437
How do you live a life
full of nothing?

1556
00:50:49,197 --> 00:50:50,391
How do you do it?

1557
00:51:46,677 --> 00:51:47,587
I fucked the shit out of her!

1558
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:48,951
What retribution?

1559
00:51:50,157 --> 00:51:53,149
Please...

1560
00:51:53,557 --> 00:51:55,195
It's as if his wife's death

1561
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:57,154
just left him there,
stuck in time forever.

1562
00:52:00,237 --> 00:52:01,431
My wife is dead.

1563
00:52:02,277 --> 00:52:05,633
Your friend is dead.
Gomez is dead too. They're all dead.

1564
00:52:07,717 --> 00:52:09,389
They'd give him an injection

1565
00:52:09,557 --> 00:52:10,626
and he'd take a nap.

1566
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:12,465
Nobody, Benjamin.

1567
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,633
Let him grow old.

1568
00:52:15,997 --> 00:52:18,591
Live a life full of nothing.

1569
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:20,395
How did you start over?

1570
00:52:20,557 --> 00:52:22,468
That was 25 years ago.

1571
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:26,235
25 years, Esposito.

1572
00:52:26,957 --> 00:52:28,151
Forget about it.

1573
00:54:18,157 --> 00:54:19,306
Please.

1574
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:23,346
Tell him...

1575
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:28,348
Tell him at least to talk to me.

1576
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,311
Please.

1577
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:30,110
You said life.

1578
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:00,556
"I FEAR"

1579
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:11,589
"I LOVE YOU"

1580
00:57:29,797 --> 00:57:32,265
- Is she in?
- Yeah, in her office.

1581
00:57:43,557 --> 00:57:44,706
You're alive.

1582
00:57:45,357 --> 00:57:46,392
Yeah.

1583
00:57:47,957 --> 00:57:49,470
I need to talk to you.

1584
00:57:57,517 --> 00:57:59,667
- Shall I bring coffee, ma'am?
- Go away.

1585
00:58:06,637 --> 00:58:08,116
It'll be complicated.

1586
00:58:09,757 --> 00:58:11,110
I don't care.

1587
00:58:22,117 --> 00:58:23,550
Shut the door.

00:58:35,517 --> 00:58:38,907
