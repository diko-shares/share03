Then you must be John McClane.

175
00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.645
-Joe Takagi.
-Hi.

176
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.064
-How was your ride in?
-Nice.

177
00:12:12.064 --> 00:12:15.109
-I have you to thank for that?
-It seemed the least we could do.

178
00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.194
It's quite a place you have here.

179
00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.238
It will be if we ever get it finished.

180
00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.532
There are still several floors
under construction.

181
00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:25.035
Holly went to the vault room to fax some
documents. She should be back any minute.

182
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.329
In the meanwhile,
her office is right back here.

183

(sniffs)

185
00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.256
I was just makin' a call,
and this was, uh, the nearest phone.

186
00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.926
I want you to meet John McClane,
Holly's husband.

187
00:12:42.219 --> 00:12:43.637
Holly's policeman.

188
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:46.056
Ellis is in charge of
international development.

189
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.225
(sniffs) Heard a heck of a lot about you.

190
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.436
Missed some.

191
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.563
(sniffs)

192
00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:53.606
Uh, could I get you anything?

193
00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.149
Food, cake, uh,

194
00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:57.109
some watered-down champagne?

195
00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.652
No, thank you. I'm fine.

196
00:13:00.154 --> 00:13:03.240
You throw quite a party.

197
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.118
I didn't realize they celebrated Christmas
in Japan.

198
00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:07.578
Hey, we're flexible.

199
00:13:07.578 --> 00:13:10.331
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

200
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:13.334
(laughing)

201
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.669
Actually, it's kind of sort of
a double celebration.

202
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.588
We, uh, closed a pretty big deal today.

203
00:13:17.588 --> 00:13:20.132
And a lot of it was due to Holly.
Am I right, Jo-Jo?

204
00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.469
-Go without me. I'll be four minutes.
-(laughs, sniffs)

205
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.474
John.

206
00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.021
Have you met everyone?

207
00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:36.148
No, we've been sticking him with spears.

208
00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.484
Of course he has.

209
00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.153
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

210
00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:45.074
-Yeah.
-I was hoping you made that flight.

211
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:47.701
Show him the watch. (sniffs)

212
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:49.036
Later.

213
00:13:49.036 --> 00:13:51.121
Well, go on. Show him.
What, are you embarrassed?

214
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:54.166
It's just a small token of appreciation
for all her hard work.

215
00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.335
It's a Rolex.

216
00:13:57.378 --> 00:13:59.338
I'm sure I'll see it later.

217
00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:01.590
Is there a place where I could wash up?

218
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.093
Sure.

219
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.151
You'll have to forgive Ellis.

220
00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:24.321
He gets very depressed this time of year.

221
00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:27.032
He thought he was God's greatest gift,
you know?

222
00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.285
Yeah, I know the type.

223
00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.412
I think he's got his eye on you.

224
00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:35.374
It's okay. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

225
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.669
Where you staying?

226
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:42.631
Things happened so fast, I didn't get
a chance to ask you on the phone.

227
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:46.719
-Cappy Roberts retired out here.
-Oh, yeah?

228
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:49.555
-Told me I could bunk in with him.
-Cappy retired, huh?

229
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.765

-Ramona.

230

I mean, it's not huge or anything,

236
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.452

to have you at the house.

237

238
00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:20.544

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:26.091

You're married to me.

250
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.794
I'm not gonna have this conversation
again. We did this in July.

251
00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.338
-We never finished this conversation.
-I had an opportunity.

252
00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.674
-I had to take it.
-Right. No matter what the consequences,

253
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:09.635
no matter what it did to our marriage,
you had to.

254
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.887
It didn't do anything except change your
idea of what our marriage should be.

255

I could talk about industrialization

has some questions for you.

Sit down!

00:29:25.263 --> 00:29:29.142
Mr. Takagi, I'm really not interested
in your computer.

382
00:29:34.147 --> 00:29:36.483
But I need the code key

383
00:29:36.483 --> 00:29:38.526
because I am interested

384
00:29:38.526 --> 00:29:41.279
in the $640 million

385
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.989

386
00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:45.617
that you have locked in your vault.

387
00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:49.454
And the computer controls the vault.

388
00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:53.041
You want money?

389
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.460
What kind of terrorists are you?

390
00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.337
(chuckling)

391
00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:01.341
Who said we were terrorists?

(chuckling continues)

393
00:30:09.182 --> 00:30:12.727
Mr. Takagi, I sympathize
with your reluctance,

394
00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:17.482
but I'm sure you realize you're not
dealing with anything significant here.

395
00:30:17.482 --> 00:30:20.485
It's not as if
it's the education of your children.

396
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:23.446
The bonds represent, at most,

397
00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:27.033
ten days operating capital
for your parent organization.

398
00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:29.702
It's really no more than
a temporary inconvenience.

399
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:31.663
Now...

400
00:30:36.125 --> 00:30:38.211
the code, please.

401
00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:41.214
It's useless to you.

402
00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:44.175
There are seven safeguards on our vault,
and the code key is only one of them.

403
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.426
You'll never get it open.

404
00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.137
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

405
00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:50.306
I told you.

406
00:30:50.306 --> 00:30:52.433
It's not over yet.

407
00:30:57.188 --> 00:31:00.525
That's a very nice suit, Mr. Takagi.

408
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:03.444
It would be a shame to ruin it.

409
00:31:07.156 --> 00:31:09.701
I'm going to count to three.

410
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:13.329
There will not be a four.

411
00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:16.291
Give me the code.

412
00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:18.668
One.

413
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:23.131
Two.

414
00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:27.218
-Three.
-TAGAKI: I don't know it. I'm telling you.

415
00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:29.637
Get on a jet to Tokyo to ask the chairman.

416
00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:31.723
I'm telling you,
you're just gonna have to kill me.

417
00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:33.182
Okay.

418
00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:38.771
We'll do it the hard way.

419
00:31:39.063 --> 00:31:40.690
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

420
00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.235
Karl, you'd better go and check on
Heinrich's work up on the machine floor.

422
00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.553
Nothing.

423
00:32:10.553 --> 00:32:12.430
See to Heinrich.

424
00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:19.479
Now, you can break the code?

425
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:22.565
You didn't bring me along
for my charming personality.

426
00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:33.743
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots
and you're callin' the police right now.

427
00:32:33.743 --> 00:32:36.204
-♪♪ (stereo blaring)
-Of course I'm still comin' by later.

428
00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:40.249
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

429
00:32:40.249 --> 00:32:42.752
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

430
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.797
Uli, get up on the pipes.

431
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:49.592
Marco, you go through here.

-Yeah.

00:32:57.725 --> 00:32:58.726
Hans, we're on the roof.

434
00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:13.533
Here.

435
00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:18.663
Uli!

436
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:30.258
Thirty minutes to break the code.
Two hours, two-and-a-half hours,

437
00:33:30.258 --> 00:33:32.802
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

438
00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:35.430
The seventh lock, however,
is out of my hands.

439
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:37.390
(beeping)

440
00:33:52.822 --> 00:33:54.699
(beeping)

441
00:33:58.494 --> 00:34:00.955
-I'm sorry.
-The seventh lock.

442
00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:03.416
The electromagnetic seal.

443
00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:05.752
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally.

444
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.630
Trust me.

445
00:34:10.631 --> 00:34:12.675
Why the fuck didn't you stop 'em, John?

446
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.721
'Cause then you'd be dead too, asshole.

447
00:34:17.847 --> 00:34:19.515
Think, goddamn it. Think!

00:34:28.858 --> 00:34:30.318
(beeping)

449
00:34:31.694 --> 00:34:33.863
We've got a fire alarm.

450
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.948
Call 911.

451
00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:37.492
Give them the guard's name,

452
00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:40.328
the building code number
and cancel the alarm.

453
00:34:40.328 --> 00:34:42.455
Then disable the system.

454
00:34:44.874 --> 00:34:47.835
Eddie, on what floor did the alarm go off?

455
00:34:49.212 --> 00:34:51.422
Now? Should we go?

456
00:34:51.714 --> 00:34:52.590
<i>Nein.</i>

457
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.681
(sirens wailing)

458
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.480
Yes. Oh, baby, come to papa. Come on.

459
00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.733
Ah! (laughs)

460
00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:15.863
Baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

461
00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:18.407
Come to papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

462
00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:24.747
Oh, you stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

463
00:35:24.747 --> 00:35:27.500
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

464
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.626
(elevator bell dings)

465
00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:03.494
The fire has been called off, my friend.

466
00:36:08.708 --> 00:36:09.959
No one is coming to help you.

467
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.675
You might as well come out
and join the others.

468
00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.513
I promise I won't hurt you.

Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

471
00:36:55.463 --> 00:36:57.006
You won't hurt me.

472
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:59.133
Oh, yeah? Why not?

473
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:01.052
Because you're a policeman.

474
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.512
There are rules for policemen.

475
00:37:03.512 --> 00:37:06.891
Yeah. That's what my captain
keeps tellin' me.

476
00:37:14.148 --> 00:37:15.733
(grunts)

477
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:20.154
Drop that, motherfucker!
I'll fuckin' kill you!

479
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.746
Come on! Come on!
I'll fuckin' rip your head off!

480
00:37:33.376 --> 00:37:35.127
(groans)

481
00:37:39.799 --> 00:37:41.050

You bet your ass I wish to proceed.

(whirring)

486
00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:57.877
Nine million terrorists in the world,

487
00:38:57.877 --> 00:39:00.129
and I gotta kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.

488
00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:54.016
I wanted this to be professional,

489
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:55.267
efficient, adult, cooperative.

490
00:39:55.518 --> 00:39:57.228
Not a lot to ask.

491
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:59.605
Alas, your Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way,

492
00:39:59.605 --> 00:40:03.234
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

493
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:08.239
So we can go any way you want us.

494
00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:11.617
You can walk out of here
or be carried out.

495
00:40:11.617 --> 00:40:15.538
But have no illusions. We are in charge.

496
00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:19.333
So, decide now, each of you.

497
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.837
-(dings)
-And, please remember,

498
00:40:23.963 --> 00:40:26.757
we have left nothing to chance.

499
00:40:29.927 --> 00:40:33.180
-(screaming)
-(shouts in German)

500
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:38.185
-Get them back!
-MAN: Stand back!

501
00:40:45.901 --> 00:40:48.279
"Now I have a machine gun.

502
00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:53.617
Ho-ho-ho."

503
00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:58.330
A security guard we missed?

504
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.958
They're usually tired, old policemen
growing fat on a pension.

505
00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.127
No, no. This is something else.

506
00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:06.088
-WOMAN: Oh, they're gonna kill us!
-(German)

507
00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:13.762
MEN: (speaking German)

508
00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:16.974
-We have to do something, Hans.
-Yes, we do.

509
00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:21.353
We have to tell Karl his brother is dead.
Tell him to come down.

510
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.148
-Karl?
<i>-KARL (on radio): Yeah?</i>

511
00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:26.233
(speaking German)

512
00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:29.195
HANS: Franco, you and Fritz take the body
upstairs and out of sight.

513
00:41:29.195 --> 00:41:31.947
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

514
00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:33.866
FRITZ: (speaking German)

515
00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.262
(shouts)

516
00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:39.014
-I want blood!
-You'll have it.

517
00:42:39.014 --> 00:42:42.226
But let Heinrich plant the detonators
and Theo prepare the vault.

518
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:44.478
After we call the police,
they'll waste hours trying to negotiate,

519
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.147
and then you can tear the building apart
looking for this man.

520
00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:50.150
But until then, we do not alter the plan.

521
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.820
And if he alters it?

522
00:42:55.447 --> 00:42:57.449
(indistinct)

523
00:42:57.449 --> 00:42:59.410
ELLIS: What do ya think?

524
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.330
Something's wrong.

525
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.374
Cops?

526

697
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.950
You know my name, but who are you?

698
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:26.122
<i>Just another American who saw</i>
<i>too many movies as a child?</i>

699
01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:30.001
<i>Another orphan of a bankrupt culture</i>
<i>who thinks he's John Wayne?</i>

700
01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:33.004
<i>Rambo? Marshal Dillon?</i>

701
01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:36.174
I was always kind of partial
to Roy Rogers actually.

702
01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.217
I really liked those sequined shirts.

703
01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:41.429
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?

704
01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.890
(elevator bell dings)

705
01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.476
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

706
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.940
I can get the jump on everybody
if I get a remote.

707
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:53.941
<i>I don't have the new pages.</i>

708
01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:57.111
<i>-Where's the Gladden report?</i>
-Harvey, keep your pants on, will you?

709
01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:58.404
Sam, look, I'm begging you.

710
01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:00.948
Simon's at a remote thing with
that Santa sing-along.

711
01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:03.451
-I'll tell him to swing by.
-I'm not sitting on this for Simon!

712
01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:05.536
-I don't wanna hear it!
-This is my story!

713
01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:08.081
-I can't hear you.
-All right, look. I tell you what.

714
01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:11.000
You don't wanna give me a truck,
I'll go and I'll steal a truck.

715
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.503
-Give us a break, Thornburg.
-Eat it, Harvey!

716
01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:17.548
Four, three, two, one.

717
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:20.051
Harvey, we're on the air.

718
01:01:23.596 --> 01:01:27.558
Good evening. This is Harvey Johnson.

719
01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:31.521
And I'm Gail Wallens, and this
is<i> Nightline News </i>at 10:00.

720
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.524
Our top stories on this Christmas Eve--

721
01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.484
Take truck number five
and get out of here.

722
01:01:45.451 --> 01:01:48.996
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

723
01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:51.207
And the other man was Heinrich.

724
01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.000
And his bag is missing.

725
01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:57.422
But he had the detonators.

726
01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.468
Theo.

727
01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:06.347
<i>-Theo.</i>
-Yo!

728
01:02:06.347 --> 01:02:08.891
<i>We may have some problems.</i>
<i>How's our schedule?</i>

729
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.936
THEO: Three down, four to go.

730
01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:14.147
Then don't waste time talking to me.

731
01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:18.609
This is Sergeant Al Powell
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

732
01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.571
If the person who radioed for help
can hear me on this channel,

<i>acknowledge this transmission.</i>

734
01:02:23.865 --> 01:02:26.576
I say again, if the person
who radioed for help

735
01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.579

736

(sirens wailing)

737
01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.545
I read you, Powell.
You the guy in the car?

738
01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:39.589
What's left of him.

739
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.507
<i>Can you identify yourself?</i>

740
01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:43.968
Not now. Maybe later.

741
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:47.513
Listen fast. This is a party line, and
the neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

742
01:02:47.513 --> 01:02:51.058
All right, here's the deal. You got
30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.

743
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:54.228
<i>-The leader, his name is Hans.</i>
-We have to find him and shut him up.

744
01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:57.273
-He's telling them everything!
-Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

745
01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:02.111
Until then, he can waste as much time
as he likes, but we must find the bag.

746
01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.279
Fritz, go help Uli.

747
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:05.448
-We must have the detonators.
<i>-McCLANE: A freakin' arsenal.</i>

748
01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.992
<i>They got missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

749
01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:10.203
<i>and enough plastic explosives</i>
<i>to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

750
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:14.248
They're down to nine now,
countin' the skydiver you met.

751
01:03:14.248 --> 01:03:17.376
These guys are mostly European,
judging by their clothing labels and...

752
01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.719
cigarettes.

753
01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:29.096
They're well-financed and very slick.

754
01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:32.642
-How do you know that?
<i>-I've seen enough phony I.D.'s in my time,</i>

755
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.686
to recognize that the ones they got
must've cost a fortune.

756

(sighs)

757
01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.108
Add all that up,
I don't know what the fuck it means,

758
01:03:41.108 --> 01:03:44.612
but you got some badass perpetrators,
and they're here to stay.

759
01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:49.450
I hear you, partner.
LA's finest are on it.

760
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.494
<i>So light 'em if you got 'em.</i>

761
01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.079
Way ahead of you, partner.

762
01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:56.332
<i>So what do I call you?</i>

763
01:03:58.417 --> 01:04:00.169
Call me...

764
01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:02.421
Roy.

765
01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:04.423
Well, listen up, Roy.

766
01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:08.052
If you think of anything else you think
we need to know, don't be shy, okay?

767
01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:10.555
In the meantime, find a safe place
to hole up and let us do our job.

768
01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.974
<i>-Understand?</i>
<i>-McCLANE: They're all yours, Al.</i>

769
01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.618
All right, who's talking to 'em?

770
01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:36.205
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

771
01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.292
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here?

772
01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.252
What do these pricks want?

773
01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:44.088
Well, if you mean the terrorists, sir,
we don't exactly know.

774
01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:45.756
We haven't heard a peep from them.

775
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:47.466
Well, who in the hell
have you been talking to?

776
01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.344
We don't know that either, sir.

777
01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:51.804
He won't give us his name.

778
01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.265
But he appears to be the one
who phoned in the report.

779
01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:57.476
He's killed one terrorist for sure,
and he claims he's capped off two others.

780
01:04:57.476 --> 01:04:59.103
He claims?

781
01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:02.523
Powell, has it occurred to you he could
be one of the terrorists

782
01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:03.524
pulling your chain?

783
01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:05.776
Or some nutcase in there?

784
01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:08.529
I don't think so, sir.
In fact, I think he's a cop.

785
01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:11.657
Maybe not LAPD,
but he's definitely a badge.

786
01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:13.743
-How do you know that?
-A hunch.

787
01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:18.289
Things he said, like being able
to spot a phony I.D.

788
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:20.124
Jesus Christ, Powell!

789
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:23.085
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know.

790
01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:25.755
-TV's here.
-Oh, shit.

791

-What idiot put you in charge?
-You did...

796

when you murdered my boss.

Now everybody's looking to me.

798
01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:58.788
Personally, I'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

799
01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.423
Go on.

800
01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:11.467
We have a pregnant woman out there.

801
01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:14.470
Relax. She's not due
for a couple of weeks.

802
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:17.723
But sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

803
01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:21.143
So I would like permission to move her to
one of the offices where there's a sofa.

804
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.648
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out to you. Good enough?

805
01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.774
Good enough.

806
01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:29.276
And unless you like it messy,

807
01:06:29.276 --> 01:06:31.320
I'd start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

808
01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:36.450
Yes, you're right. It will be done.

809
01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.662

<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

1029
01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.378
<i>Or should I call you...</i>

1030
01:22:06.212 --> 01:22:07.631
Mr. McClane?

1031
01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.593
Mr. Officer John McClane

1032
01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:15.388
<i>of the New York Police Department.</i>

1033
01:22:15.388 --> 01:22:18.266
-Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
-Got it.

1034
01:22:18.266 --> 01:22:20.602
Better get ahold of somebody at Dispatch.

1035
01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:24.773
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in third grade.

1036
01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.108
My friends call me John.

1037
01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:29.569
You're neither, shithead.

1038
01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.448
I have someone who wants to talk to you--

1039
01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:36.242
a very special friend

1040
01:22:36.242 --> 01:22:38.453
<i>who was with you at the party tonight.</i>

1041
01:22:44.584 --> 01:22:46.753
Hey, John Boy.

1042
01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.464
Ellis?

1043
01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:51.424
<i>Yeah.</i>

1044
01:22:51.424 --> 01:22:52.634
<i>Now, listen, John.</i>

1045
01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:55.387
<i>They're givin' me a few minutes to try</i>
<i>to talk some sense into you.</i>

1046
01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:58.473
I know you think you're doing your job,
and I can appreciate that,

1047
01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.600
<i>but you're just dragging this thing out.</i>

1048
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.478
<i>Now, look, no one gets out of here</i>
<i>until these guys</i>

1049
01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:06.564
can talk to the LA police,
and that just ain't gonna happen

1050
01:23:06.564 --> 01:23:08.566
until you stop messing up the works,
<i>capisce?</i>

1051
01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.824
Ellis, what have you told them?

1052
01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:19.285
I told them we were old friends,

1053
01:23:19.285 --> 01:23:21.329
and you were my guest at the party.

1054
01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:24.624
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

1055
01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:27.335
Tell me about it. (chuckles)

1056
01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.426
All right, John, listen.

1057
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.887
<i>They want you to tell them</i>
<i>where the detonators are.</i>

1058
01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.472
<i>They know people are listening.</i>

1059
01:23:40.765 --> 01:23:42.308
<i>They want the detonators,</i>

1060
01:23:42.308 --> 01:23:43.810
<i>or they're gonna kill me.</i>

1061
01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:48.815
John, didn't you hear me?

1062
01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.361
Yeah, I hear you.

1063
01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.822
John, I think you could get
with the program a little, huh?

1064
01:23:55.822 --> 01:23:57.907
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

1065
01:23:58.158 --> 01:24:00.827
Now tell these guys where the detonators
are so no one else gets hurt.

1066
01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.788
I'm putting my life on the line for you,
pal.

1067
01:24:03.788 --> 01:24:06.458
<i>-Ellis, listen to me very carefully.</i>
-John--

1068
01:24:06.458 --> 01:24:08.668
Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!

1069
01:24:08.668 --> 01:24:10.670
Put Hans back on the line.

1070
01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.631
<i>Hans, this shithead does not know</i>

1071
01:24:13.631 --> 01:24:15.800
<i>what kind of man you are, but I do.</i>
<i>Listen--</i>

1072
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:18.762
Good. Then you'll give us what we want
and save your friend's life.

1073
01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:21.514
You're not part of this equation.
It's time you realized that.

1074
01:24:21.514 --> 01:24:23.558
Hey, what am I, a method actor, Hans?

1075
01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:27.395
<i>Babe, put away the gun.</i>
<i>This is radio, not television.</i>

1076
01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:29.397
Hans, this asshole is not my friend.

1077
01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:30.815
I just met him tonight. I don't know him.

1078
01:24:30.815 --> 01:24:32.859
Jesus Christ, Ellis,
these people are gonna kill you!

1079
01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.695
-Tell them you don't know me!
-ELLIS (chuckles)

1080
01:24:35.695 --> 01:24:38.364
<i>John, how can you say that</i>
<i>after all these years?</i>

1081
01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:40.533
John?

1082
01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:42.619
John?

1083
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:51.628
(gunshot)

1084
01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:54.297
(screaming, shouting)

1085
01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.432
(screaming, shouting continue on radio)

1086
01:25:05.725 --> 01:25:07.435
Do you hear that?

1087
01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:10.605
Talk to me! Where are my detonators?

1088
01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.941
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

1089
01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:16.402
<i>Sooner or later, I might get to someone</i>
<i>you do care about.</i>

1090
01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.322
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1091
01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.451
Did you hear that?
He just let the guy die, man.

1092
01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:26.412
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1093
01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:28.373
-That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
-Christ, man.

1094
01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.792
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1095
01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.418
-Is this on the right channel?
-Yes, sir.

1096
01:25:32.418 --> 01:25:34.963
-He did everything he could to save him.
-(sighs)

1097
01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.340
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now.

1098
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:39.843
No way, man. No way.
They'd be talking to us.

1099
01:25:39.843 --> 01:25:43.555
Listen, you tell this partner of yours
to stay the hell out of this from now on.

1100
01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:45.431
Because if he doesn't, I'm gonna nail him.

1101
01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.559
I'm really gonna nail his ass now.
Believe me.

1102
01:25:47.559 --> 01:25:50.687
The man is hurtin'. He is alone, tired,

1103
01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:54.023
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody down here.

1104
01:25:54.023 --> 01:25:55.984
Now, you're gonna stand there and tell me

1105
01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.904
that he's gonna give a damn about what
you'll do to him if he makes it out alive?

1106
01:25:59.904 --> 01:26:02.782
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

1107
01:26:02.782 --> 01:26:04.993
You listen to me, Sergeant.

1108
01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.954
Anytime you wanna go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1109
01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.622
No, sir.

1110
01:26:09.622 --> 01:26:11.749
You couldn't drag me away.

1111
01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:14.586
<i>HANS (on radio): Attention, police.</i>

1112
01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:16.796
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1113
01:26:16.796 --> 01:26:18.882
-This is Sergeant Al Powell--
-Give me that.

1114
01:26:20.049 --> 01:26:22.760
This is, uh-- This is, uh,
Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1115
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:25.513
-Who is this?
-This is Hans Gruber.

1116
01:26:26.806 --> 01:26:29.684
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

1117
01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.936
We have no wish for further loss of life.

1118
01:26:31.936 --> 01:26:35.064
Well, uh, what is it you do wish for,
Mr. Gruber?

1119
01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:39.819
I have comrades-in-arms around the world
languishing in prison.

1120
01:26:39.819 --> 01:26:42.071
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber

1121
01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:45.033
for its own ends.
Now it can rattle it for me.

1122
01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:50.371
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1123
01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:54.083
In Northern Ireland,
the seven members of the New Provo Front.

1124
01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:58.880
<i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders</i>
<i>of Liberté de Québec.</i>

1125
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.051
<i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members</i>
<i>of the Asian Dawn movement.</i>

1126
01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:04.552
What the fuck?

1127
01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:06.512
(mouthing words)

1128
01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:08.681
I read about them in<i> Time </i>magazine.

1129
01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:13.603
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1130
01:27:13.603 --> 01:27:16.856
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof,

1131
01:27:16.856 --> 01:27:21.069
and they will accompany us in helicopters
to the Los Angeles International Airport,

1132
01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:23.613
where they will be given
further instructions.

1133
01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:25.740
You have two hours to comply.

1134
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.535
Wait a minute. Mr. Gruber, this is crazy.

1135
01:27:29.535 --> 01:27:31.537
I-I-I don't have the authority.

1136
01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:33.081
I can't authorize--
Two hours is not enough.

1137
01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.958
-(transmission cuts out)
-H-Hello?

1138
01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.125
Hello?

1139
01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:38.753
Danny, did you get all that?

1140
01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.797
Let's go. We gotta make some calls.

1141
01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:43.007
Do you think they'll even try to do it?

1142
01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:44.884
Who cares?

1143
01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.722
Theo, are we on schedule?

1144
01:27:49.722 --> 01:27:51.683
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1145
01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:53.518
And you better be right,
because it looks like

1146
01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.103
this last one's gonna take a miracle.

1147
01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:58.147
It's Christmas, Theo.
It's the time of miracles.

1148
01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:01.901
So be of good cheer and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1149
01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.572
Karl, hunt that little shit down

1150
01:28:06.572 --> 01:28:07.824
and get those detonators.

1151
01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:10.076
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1152
01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:12.787
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1153
01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:15.123
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1154
01:28:16.582 --> 01:28:18.501
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1155
01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:21.921
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1156
01:28:23.589 --> 01:28:26.092
Well, it's gonna be both our asses
if you're wrong.

1157
01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:27.677
I hear you.

1158
01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.977
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1159
01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:38.980
<i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>

1160
01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.190
Don't ask me, man.

1161
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:44.027
I'm just a desk jockey who was
on my way home when you rang.

1162
01:28:44.027 --> 01:28:47.447
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

1163

1165
01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:59.834
Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1166
01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:03.087
Well, Gail, by this time the hostages
should be going through

1167
01:29:03.087 --> 01:29:05.757
the early stages
of the "Helsinki Syndrome."

1168
01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:09.177
-As in Helsinki, Sweden.
-HASSELDORF: Finland.

1169
01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:13.181
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists go through

1170
01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:17.852
a sort of psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.

1171
01:29:17.852 --> 01:29:21.022
<i>A strange sort of trust and bond develops.</i>

1172
01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:23.232
<i>We've had situations where the hostages</i>

1173
01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:25.860
<i>have embraced their captors</i>
<i>after their release</i>

1174
01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.112
<i>and even corresponded</i>
<i>with them in prison.</i>

1175
01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:30.740
No, no. No, darling. "Asian Dawn."

1176
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:34.243
Dawn. D-A-W-N.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.704
-Sir?
-I-- Yeah?

1178
01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:39.207
-The FBI is here.
-Oh. The FBI is here now?

1179
01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:41.501
Yes, sir, right over there.

1180
01:29:41.501 --> 01:29:44.629
-Hold this.
-You want a breath mint?

1181
01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:49.258
Uh, yeah. We got it.

1182
01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:52.095

-No relation.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:03.207
Hi, there.

1189
01:31:03.207 --> 01:31:05.001
How you doing?

1190
01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:11.132
Oh!

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:15.303
Please, God, no. You're one of them,
aren't you? You're one of them.

1192
01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.890
Don't-- Don't kill me.
Please, don't. Please!

1193
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:21.851
-Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1194
01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:25.938
Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1195
01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.735
Oh, God.

1196
01:31:33.821 --> 01:31:36.949
What the fuck are you doing up here?
What were you looking for?

1197
01:31:36.949 --> 01:31:40.745
I managed to get out of there, and, uh--

1198
01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.914
Well, I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1199
01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:46.000
and see if I could signal for help,
you know.

1200
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.754
It's just through here.
Why don't you come and help--

1201
01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:52.798
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget the roof.
-Come on. Come on.

1202
01:31:52.798 --> 01:31:55.092
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1203
01:31:57.178 --> 01:31:59.388
Come on. You wanna stay alive,
you stay with me.

1204
01:32:03.142 --> 01:32:04.727
Well, the best way we can figure it is

1205
01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:08.022
we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages
up there,

1206
01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:10.233
probably on the 30th floor,

1207
01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:13.861
and maybe, I don't know,
seven or eight terrorists up there.

1208
01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:16.113
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1209
01:32:16.113 --> 01:32:18.157
Thank you. We'll handle it from here.

1210
01:32:18.157 --> 01:32:20.952
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1211
01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:23.371
Aren't you forgetting something?

1212
01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.664
Such as?

1213
01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:26.290
What about John McClane?

1214
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:29.377
He's the reason why we have
the information we have up until now.

1215
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:33.214
He's also the reason why you're facing
seven terrorists instead of 12.

1216
01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.800
He's inside? Who is he?

1217
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.386
Well, he might be a cop.
I don't know. We're checking on that.

1218
01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:40.054
One of yours?

1219
01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:41.305
No. No way.

1220
01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:47.812
Do you smoke?

1221
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.898
Yeah.

1222
01:32:55.361 --> 01:32:56.737
Thanks.

You don't work for Nakatomi.

1232

Bill Clay.

1235
01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:02.887
You know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1236
01:34:04.138 --> 01:34:06.265
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1237
01:34:06.265 --> 01:34:08.476
You know that game with the guns
that shoot red paint?

1238
01:34:08.768 --> 01:34:11.479
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1239
01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:13.898
Well...

1240
01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:18.361
time for the real thing, Bill.

1241
01:34:27.078 --> 01:34:29.455
All you gotta do is pull the trigger.

1242
01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:30.456

1252

But what do you want with the detonators,
Hans?

1253
01:35:23.175 --> 01:35:25.386
I already used all the explosives.

1254
01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.390
Or did I?

1255
01:35:31.142 --> 01:35:33.227
-I'm going to count to three.
-Yeah.

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.980
Powell. Powell, talk to me.
What's going on here?

1361
01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.523
<i>POWELL: Ask the FBI.</i>

1362
01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:19.067
They got the universal terrorist playbook,

1363
01:43:19.318 --> 01:43:21.695
and they're running it step by step.

1364
01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.782
THEO: It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1365
01:43:25.782 --> 01:43:28.952
-(latches unlocking)
-Yes!

1366
01:43:28.952 --> 01:43:30.662
(alarm blaring)

1367
01:43:45.344 --> 01:43:47.012
(alarm stops)

1368
01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:53.602
Merry Christmas.

1369
01:43:55.854 --> 01:43:57.856
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants right now.

1370
01:43:57.856 --> 01:43:59.733
The mayor's gonna have my ass.

1371
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:08.867
Whoo!

1372
01:44:21.129 --> 01:44:24.633
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1373
01:44:24.633 --> 01:44:27.177
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1374
01:44:27.177 --> 01:44:28.679
We've shut them down.

1375
01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:32.015
We let 'em sweat for a while,
then we give 'em helicopters.

1376
01:44:32.015 --> 01:44:34.184
Right up the ass.

1377
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.939
This is Agent Johnson.

1378
01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.524
No, the other one.

1379
01:44:40.524 --> 01:44:43.568
I want that air support ready to lift off
in five minutes.

1380
01:44:43.568 --> 01:44:46.571
Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.

1381
01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:54.413
(snickering quietly) Oh, yeah!

1382
01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.709
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1383
01:45:01.503 --> 01:45:03.588
This is Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.

1384
01:45:03.588 --> 01:45:08.051
<i>The State Department has arranged</i>
<i>for the return of your comrades.</i>

1385
01:45:08.051 --> 01:45:10.804
Helicopters are en route as you requested.

1386
01:45:10.804 --> 01:45:13.515
<i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>

1387
01:45:13.515 --> 01:45:15.684
By the time he figures out what hit him,
he'll be in a body bag.

1388
01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:18.061
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1389
01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:19.813
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1390
01:45:19.813 --> 01:45:22.190
And by the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1391
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:25.652
we'll be sitting on a beach
earning 20 percent.

1392
01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:32.075
(groans)

1393
01:45:32.075 --> 01:45:34.077
Powell.

1394
01:45:34.077 --> 01:45:35.746
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1395
01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:39.124
I'm here, John.

1396
01:45:41.126 --> 01:45:44.129
Listen, man, I'm starting
to get a bad feeling up here.

1397
01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.715
I want you to do something for me.

1398
01:45:46.715 --> 01:45:47.799
Um--

1399
01:45:49.718 --> 01:45:53.847
I want you to find my wife. Don't ask me
how. By then, you'll know how.

1400
01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:56.975
Uh, I want you to tell her something.

1401
01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:59.936
I want you to tell her that...

1402
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:01.813
um...

1403
01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:09.654
Tell her it took me a while
to figure out...

1404
01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:13.533
what a jerk I've been, but, um...

1405
01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.661
but that...

1406
01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:23.835
that when things started to
pan out for her, I should've...

1407
01:46:25.796 --> 01:46:27.589
been more supportive,

1408
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:28.256
and, uh...

1409
01:46:30.008 --> 01:46:32.219
<i>and I just should've been behind her more.</i>

1410
01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:34.596
(panting)

1411
01:46:34.596 --> 01:46:36.765
Oh, shit.

1412
01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:41.603
Tell her that, um--

1413
01:46:43.146 --> 01:46:46.233
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1414
01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:52.030
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1415
01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:56.201
She never heard me say, "I'm sorry."

1416
01:46:58.036 --> 01:47:00.747
And I want you to tell her that.
I want you to tell her that...

1417
01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:04.543
"John said that he was sorry."

1418
01:47:05.544 --> 01:47:06.545
Okay?

1419
01:47:07.712 --> 01:47:09.131
You got that, man?

1420
01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:10.882
<i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>

1421
01:47:12.175 --> 01:47:15.011
But you can tell her that yourself.

1422
01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:17.764
You just watch your ass, and you'll
make it out of there. You hear me?

1423
01:47:19.307 --> 01:47:21.685
<i>Well, I guess that's up to</i>
<i>the man upstairs.</i>

1424
01:47:25.564 --> 01:47:27.274
<i>John?</i>

1425
01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.276
<i>John?</i>

1426
01:47:29.276 --> 01:47:31.570
What the fuck were you doing upstairs,
Hans?

1427
01:47:34.322 --> 01:47:37.117
<i>-John?</i>
-No, Al, listen.

1428
01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.743
Listen, just lay off for a while.

1429
01:47:40.829 --> 01:47:42.914
<i>I gotta go check on something.</i>

1430
01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:48.670
-One minute. That's all I'm asking.
-(Spanish)

1431
01:47:48.670 --> 01:47:51.673
One minute just to speak to you.
All right. All right.

1432
01:47:51.673 --> 01:47:54.885
All right. Get back.
Get back. Off. Off. All right.

1433
01:47:54.885 --> 01:47:58.346
Look, you let me in right now,
or I call the INS.

1434
01:47:58.346 --> 01:47:59.973
<i>Comprende?</i>

1435
01:48:01.391 --> 01:48:03.101
Look, this is the last time

1436
01:48:03.101 --> 01:48:05.687
these kids are gonna have
to speak to their parents.

1437
01:48:08.273 --> 01:48:11.902
All right? All right.
Come on. Come on.

1438
01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:26.166
What were you doing, Hans?
What were you doing?

1439
01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:44.309
(beeping)

1440
01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:50.690
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1441
01:48:54.903 --> 01:48:57.113
Powell, Powell, listen to me!
It's a double cross!

1442
01:48:57.113 --> 01:48:58.990
The whole roof
of the building's wired to--

1443
01:49:01.993 --> 01:49:03.954
<i>POWELL: John.</i>

1444
01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.165
<i>John.</i>

1445
01:49:07.165 --> 01:49:10.085
John, come in. Did you get that?

1446
01:49:10.085 --> 01:49:12.295
No. Something about a double cross.

1447
01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:15.048
Tell me about it.

1448
01:49:21.304 --> 01:49:23.390
We are both professionals.

1449
01:49:25.809 --> 01:49:27.269
This is personal.

1450
01:49:28.728 --> 01:49:29.813
Oh.

1451
01:49:50.959 --> 01:49:52.294
They're coming.

1452
01:49:53.962 --> 01:49:56.131
-Choppers are coming.
-Okay.

1453
01:49:56.131 --> 01:49:59.217
Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.

1454
01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:02.304
<i>THORNBURG: Your mom and dad</i>
<i>are very important people.</i>

1455
01:50:02.304 --> 01:50:05.932
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1456
01:50:05.932 --> 01:50:08.893
<i>So is there something you would like</i>
<i>to say to them if they're watching?</i>

1457
01:50:10.312 --> 01:50:12.105
<i>Come home.</i>

1458
01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:22.449
Mrs. McClane.

1459
01:50:26.202 --> 01:50:28.747
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1460
01:50:29.914 --> 01:50:32.792
(screaming, shouting)

1461
01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.377
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1462
01:50:34.377 --> 01:50:36.921
Lock them up there and come right back.

1463
01:50:39.382 --> 01:50:41.426
MAN: Move! Come on! Let's move!

1464
01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.328
You should've heard your brother squeal

1465
01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:10.288
when I broke his fucking neck!

1466
01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:16.252
What do you figure the breakage?

1467
01:51:16.252 --> 01:51:18.338
Figure we take out the terrorists,

1468
01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:22.092
lose 20--25 percent of the hostages...
tops.

1469
01:51:22.092 --> 01:51:24.594
I can live with that.

1470
01:51:24.886 --> 01:51:26.137
Keep this thing on the deck.

1471
01:51:26.137 --> 01:51:29.474
They're expecting transports,
not gunships.

1472
01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:44.155
Move it! Come on! Move!

1473
01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:45.156
Come on! Come on!

1474
01:51:45.156 --> 01:51:46.491
Move it!

1475
01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.327
Let's go! Move!

1476
01:51:53.039 --> 01:51:56.000
Theo. A little bonus for us.

1477
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.920
-Please, sit down. Sit down.
-Hey!

1478
01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:01.005
A policeman's wife might come in handy.

1479
01:52:01.005 --> 01:52:03.216
McClane, I have some news for you.

1480
01:52:04.509 --> 01:52:05.969
McClane.

1481
01:52:13.476 --> 01:52:15.353
(groans)

1482
01:52:17.147 --> 01:52:18.982
Come on! Move, move!

1483
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:23.069
Come on!

1484
01:52:34.831 --> 01:52:36.916
Motherfucker, I'll kill you!

1485
01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:43.298
-(beeping)
-Armed. The truck?

1486
01:52:43.298 --> 01:52:44.424
The truck.

1487
01:52:52.056 --> 01:52:53.933
After all your posturing,

1488
01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:55.602
all your little speeches,

1489
01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.520
you're nothing but a common thief.

1490
01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:01.232
I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.

1491
01:53:01.232 --> 01:53:04.152
And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.

1492
01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:13.953
Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!

1493
01:53:13.953 --> 01:53:15.663
I'm gonna fucking cook you,

1494
01:53:15.663 --> 01:53:17.290
and I'm gonna fucking eat you!

1495
01:53:40.021 --> 01:53:42.065
I don't like this, Sarge.

1496
01:53:50.156 --> 01:53:52.659
(whooping)

1497
01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:55.954
Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?

1498
01:53:57.539 --> 01:54:00.124
I was in junior high, dickhead.

1499
01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:19.143
(panicked chattering)

1500
01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:31.489
Where's Holly? Where's Holly Gennero?

1501
01:54:31.489 --> 01:54:33.408
Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?

1502
01:54:33.408 --> 01:54:35.243
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1503
01:54:35.243 --> 01:54:36.744
-They took her!
-Where?

1504
01:54:36.744 --> 01:54:38.746
-The vault!
-Where is the vault?

1505
01:54:38.746 --> 01:54:41.291
The 30th floor. Up the stairs.
They just took her!

1506
01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:44.711
Get downstairs, all of you!

1507
01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:47.589
The whole fuckin' roof is wired to blow.
Get down!

1508
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:50.341
Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!

1509
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.427
(screaming, shouting)

1510
01:54:52.427 --> 01:54:53.553
They made us, Bureau.

1511
01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:56.055
-You got a terrorist shooting hostages.
-I see it. Bank left.

1512
01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:05.106
Nail that sucker!

1513
01:55:13.197 --> 01:55:16.284
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1514
01:55:16.284 --> 01:55:19.329
Shit. Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1515
01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:41.100
What the fuck-- Jesus!

1516
01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:45.563
Oh, John, what the fuck are you doing?

1517
01:55:45.563 --> 01:55:48.149
How the fuck did you get into this shit?

1518
01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:53.446
(screaming, shouting continues)

1519
01:55:58.743 --> 01:55:59.744
There's something wrong.

1520
01:55:59.744 --> 01:56:01.412
They're coming back down.

1521
01:56:01.412 --> 01:56:03.748
-Blow the roof.
-But Karl's up there!

1522
01:56:03.748 --> 01:56:05.166
Blow the roof!

1523
01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:11.589
I promise I will never even think

1524
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:14.175
about going up in a tall building again.

1525
01:56:17.553 --> 01:56:19.806
Oh, God. Please don't let me die.

1526
01:56:32.610 --> 01:56:34.779
-Holy shit!
-(yelling)

1527
01:57:01.472 --> 01:57:03.766
(panting)

1528
01:57:03.766 --> 01:57:04.767
(groans)

1529
01:57:24.662 --> 01:57:27.248
(screaming)

1530
01:57:27.248 --> 01:57:28.624
(shouts in French)

1531
01:57:51.564 --> 01:57:53.608
Holy Christ!

1532
01:57:55.401 --> 01:57:57.904
We're gonna need some more FBI guys,
I guess.

1533
01:57:57.904 --> 01:57:59.781
(gasping)

1534
01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:08.539
(dings)

1535
01:58:10.708 --> 01:58:12.627
Jesus fucking Christ!

1536
01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:26.682
(clattering)

1537
01:58:38.903 --> 01:58:40.905
What the fuck is going on?

1538
01:58:43.741 --> 01:58:44.784
HOLLY: What are you gonna do,

1539
01:58:44.784 --> 01:58:46.953
sit here while the building
falls down around your ears?

1540
01:58:47.245 --> 01:58:48.871
MAN (shouting in German)

1541
01:58:55.753 --> 01:58:58.798
-Shit!
-Hey! All right!

1542
01:58:58.798 --> 01:59:00.716
(shouts in French)

1543
01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.970
Hang on, baby.

1544
01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:05.596
Hang on, honey.

1545
01:59:05.596 --> 01:59:07.431
Oh, God.

1546
01:59:45.344 --> 01:59:47.847
BOTH (shouting in French)

1547
01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.061
McCLANE: Hans!

1548
02:00:09.410 --> 02:00:10.578
Jesus.

1549
02:00:11.495 --> 02:00:12.830
Hi, honey.

1550
02:00:35.478 --> 02:00:37.021
So that's what this was all about?

1551
02:00:37.021 --> 02:00:39.023
A fucking robbery?

1552
02:00:39.023 --> 02:00:40.566
Put down the gun.

1553
02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.612
Why did you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1554
02:00:44.612 --> 02:00:47.698
When you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1555
02:00:47.698 --> 02:00:50.785
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you,

1556
02:00:50.785 --> 02:00:53.079
unless they think you're already dead.

1557
02:00:53.371 --> 02:00:55.414
Put down the gun.

1558
02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.423
(gasps)

1559
02:01:05.841 --> 02:01:07.510
HANS:<i> Nein! </i>This is mine.

1560
02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:12.807
You got me.

1561
02:01:12.807 --> 02:01:15.601
HANS: Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.

1562
02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:17.561
Americans, all alike.

1563
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:21.107
Well, this time, John Wayne does not walk
off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1564
02:01:21.399 --> 02:01:23.109
That's Gary Cooper, asshole.

1565
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:25.027
Enough jokes.

1566
02:01:25.027 --> 02:01:27.989
You'd have made a pretty good
cowboy yourself, Hans.

1567
02:01:28.906 --> 02:01:30.157
Oh, yes.

1568
02:01:30.157 --> 02:01:32.451
What was it you said to me before?

1569
02:01:33.619 --> 02:01:36.664
Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.

1570
02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:37.915
McCLANE (laughing)

1571
02:01:57.476 --> 02:01:58.811
Holly!

1572
02:02:04.483 --> 02:02:05.776
Happy trails, Hans.

1573
02:02:10.823 --> 02:02:12.908
(screams)

1574
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:21.667
(screams)

1575
02:02:50.154 --> 02:02:52.239
I hope that's not a hostage.

1576
02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:21.018
(siren wailing)

1577
02:03:21.018 --> 02:03:24.855
MAN: Give me water hook-ups for engine
companies five, three, nine, six.

1578
02:03:28.692 --> 02:03:31.278
MAN #2: Over here. It's a better angle.

1579
02:03:31.278 --> 02:03:33.614
MAN #1: Let's give 'em a hand over there.

1580
02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:37.284
Keep it going now. Keep it going.

1581
02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:45.126
Come on. Come on! We're gonna miss it.

1582
02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:47.211
-Okay, hand me my notes.
-Come on!

1583
02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:49.713
Keep that water on there.

1584
02:04:09.733 --> 02:04:11.610
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1585
02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:13.070
Did they frighten you at all? Any comment?

1586
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:15.281
It was terrible.
We don't wanna talk about it.

1587
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:18.534
-REPORTER: How does it feel to be outside?
-(mouths words)

1588
02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:46.187
(laughing)

1589
02:04:51.775 --> 02:04:53.194
(laughing)

1590
02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.947
(sighs)

1591
02:04:59.950 --> 02:05:01.994
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1592
02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.245
Holly Gennero.

1593
02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:07.958
-Holly McClane.
-Hello, Holly.

1594
02:05:07.958 --> 02:05:09.835
You got yourself a good man.

1595
02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:11.378
You take good care of him.

1596
02:05:12.713 --> 02:05:14.131
-ROBINSON: McClane?
-MAN: Yeah, it's okay. Let him through.

1597
02:05:14.131 --> 02:05:16.342
McClane, I wanna debrief.

1598
02:05:16.342 --> 02:05:20.179
I want a debriefing.
You got some things to answer for, mister.

1599
02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:23.265
Ellis's murder, for one thing.
Property damage.

1600
02:05:23.265 --> 02:05:25.351
Interfering with police business.

1601
02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:27.853
(screaming)

1602
02:06:05.975 --> 02:06:09.061
ROBINSON: All right, I want two of you to
go inside and see if there's anybody else.

1603
02:06:09.061 --> 02:06:11.105
MAN: Yes, sir. I'll take the left.

1604
02:06:18.821 --> 02:06:20.406
-MAN: Watch it!
-Whoa.

1605
02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:22.366
This one's with me.

1606
02:06:29.164 --> 02:06:32.418
-(horn honking)
-MAN: Five, four, three, two.

1607
02:06:32.710 --> 02:06:35.170
Mr. McClane. Mr. McClane,
now that it's all over,

1608
02:06:35.170 --> 02:06:38.257
after this incredible ordeal,
what are your feelings?

1609
02:06:39.383 --> 02:06:42.136
BYSTANDERS (laughing)

1610
02:06:43.804 --> 02:06:45.222
Well, well, well.

1611
02:06:46.181 --> 02:06:48.267
-Merry Christmas, Argyle.
-Merry Christmas.

1612
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:54.023
Did you get that?

1613
02:06:54.023 --> 02:06:57.192
Let me through. Let me through.
Thank you.

1614
02:06:57.192 --> 02:07:00.279
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
