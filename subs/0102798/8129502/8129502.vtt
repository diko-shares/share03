1
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.425
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.664
He says you stole the bread.

3
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.209
It's a lie.
I caught him stealing ours.

4
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:32.504
Cut off the infidel's hand.

5
00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.755
No, I took the bread!

6
00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.384
- Wait. That's not true.
- They're not interested in the truth.

7
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.052
But he's lying!

8
00:03:39.177 --> 00:03:41.179
You're too weak, Peter.
You would not live through it.

9
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:44.766
As you wish.
Cut the other's hand off as well.

10
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.477
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Robin.

11
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.817
Oh, God!

12
00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.160
No! No! No!

13
00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:23.180
This is English courage.

14
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.282
That's for five years of hell!

15
00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:50.332
Behind you!

16
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.843
Come on, Robin, for God's sake!
Come on!

17
00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.930
Wait! Take us with you!

18
00:05:11.603 --> 00:05:14.064
You cannot save those people, Christian!

19
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.942
- But you can save me!
- They're coming, Robin.

20
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.320
Christian!

21
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.113
Why should I?

22
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:24.783
For pity's sake.
Mine is a sentence of death.

23
00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:26.409
No, Robin, he's a Moor!
Don't listen to him!

24
00:05:26.535 --> 00:05:28.787
Set me free!
I will show you a way out.

25
00:05:28.912 --> 00:05:32.040
- Why should we?
- If you do not, we are all dead men.

26
00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.085
No, Robin, for God's sake!
Robin, they're coming!

27
00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:45.512
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry! Come, Christian! Come!

28
00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:54.729
This way!

29
00:06:01.945 --> 00:06:04.447
Thanks. I misjudged you.

30
00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.241
You are fast with a sword,
my friend.

31
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.451
Five years I've waited
for the smell of free air.

32
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:09.661
That makes a man fast.

33
00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:13.456
Peter!

34
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:20.964
It's mortal. Leave me.

35
00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.343
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

36
00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:27.971
Now swear you'll protect her for me.

37
00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.891
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

38
00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:33.268
Swear it, Robin!

39
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:37.063
- I swear it.
- They're coming!

40
00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.191
Tell Marian
I died a free Englishman.

41
00:06:40.317 --> 00:06:42.944
Peter! Peter. Peter!

42
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.156
For England!

43
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.413
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honour.

44
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.040
Come now!

45
00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:26.154
Why did you cut me free, Christian?

46
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:31.284
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

47
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.042
Farewell, friend.

48
00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.211
God speed your way.

49
00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:43.755
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

50
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.215
What?

51
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.925
You have saved my life, Christian.

52
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.677
I will stay with you
until I have saved yours.

53
00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:50.804
That is my vow.

54
00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.432
Thanks, but I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

55
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:56.726
Only Allah can do that.

56
00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:00.271
What if I say no?

57
00:08:00.397 --> 00:08:01.690
You have no choice.

58
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:07.570
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.
You may call me Azeem.

59
00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:12.784
Robin of Locksley.

60
00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:31.511
'Kindest sir, it is rumoured you fought
in King Richard's Crusade

61
00:08:31.636 --> 00:08:34.723
'with my beloved son, Robin.

62
00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:38.309
'I fear you have returned home
to desperate times

63
00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:42.188
'when dark forces
plot against our absent king.

64
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:45.483
'I am anxious for word of my son.

65
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:48.820
'Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

66
00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:52.198
'Do you know the name of the potentate
who holds him?

67
00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:55.493
'Does he still bear me ill will?

68
00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.163
'A little news, please, sir.

69
00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.875
'I would give all that I own
for his release.'

70
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.767
- Stop there!
- Help me, my lord!

71
00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.644
You should have waited!

72
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.565
- I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.
- Duncan, it's all right. Let him go.

73
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.405
They've taken my Gwen.
My daughter!

74
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:37.660
- Who's taken her?
- Men! On horses. In masks.

75
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:40.121
We tried to stop them, but...

76
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.832
My son is dead.

77
00:09:42.957 --> 00:09:44.793
He's dead.

78
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.680
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

79
00:09:57.806 --> 00:10:00.475
Never fear, Duncan.
Good will overcome.

80
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.435
Trust in that.

81
00:10:15.907 --> 00:10:19.744
I'm sorry, my lord.
I had no choice.

82
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.711
You!

83
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.881
Locksley.

84
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:33.716
The king shall hear of this!

85
00:10:34.592 --> 00:10:37.262
- Join us.
- Never.

86
00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:41.975
Join us... or die.

87
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:49.732
God and King Richard!

88
00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:43.036
Thank you, Lord.

89
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.709
I'm home!

90
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.669
I'm home!

91
00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.466
You are strange, Christian.

92
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.927
Yes. But I'm free!

93
00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:03.389
Now I beg you to free yourself of your vow.
Return with the boat.

94
00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:06.142
I know how it feels to be so far
from your home and family.

95
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.856
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dish on our them.

96
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:16.778
I thought you'd say that.

97
00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.090
No man controls my destiny.

98
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:40.593
Especially not one who attacks downwind
and stinks of garlic.

99
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.392
Come, Azeem!

100
00:12:50.645 --> 00:12:52.480
Our fighting days are done.

101
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:56.442
By nightfall,
we'll celebrate with my father.

102
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.198
You understand, of course...

103
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:04.867
... I had to try.

104
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:08.162
I would have succeeded.

105
00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.420
Why must you walk
in back of me?

106
00:13:15.545 --> 00:13:18.881
In your country,
am I not the infidel?

107
00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:24.053
It seems safer to appear
as your slave rather than your equal.

108
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:27.015
You know, for an infidel
you have uncommon clarity of thinking.

109
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.476
Yet you tell me of nothing of yourself.
For instance, your name.

110
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.271
- Azeem. What does it mean?
- It means "great one".

111
00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:36.733
Great one, really?
Did you give yourself this name?

112
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.445
It's a joke.

113
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:46.826
Azeem the great one, I am home!

114
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.455
Whoo!

115
00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.707
Look!

116
00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.294
Mistletoe.

117
00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:02.008
Many a maid's lost her resolve to me
thanks to this little plant.

118
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:06.095
In my country, we talk to our women.

119
00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:09.682
We do not drug them with plants.

120
00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:11.225
What do you know of women?

121
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:19.442
Where I come from, Christian,
there are women of such beauty

122
00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:24.113
they can possess a man's mind so
that he would be willing to die for them.

123
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:29.452
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

124
00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.829
Because of a woman?

125
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.293
That's it, isn't it?

126
00:14:37.418 --> 00:14:39.545
That's it!

127
00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:44.717
It is close to sunset.

128
00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:47.595
You painted old dog.
Who was she?

129
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.555
The <i>mullah's</i> daughter?

130
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.141
Huh?

131
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.685
Another man's wife?

132
00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:57.563
What's her name?

133
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:04.278
Is there no sun in this cursed country?
Which way is east?

134
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:06.239
- Her name?
- East!

135
00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:08.699
Her name.

136
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.456
Jasmina.

137
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.377
- That way.
- You are sure?

138
00:15:19.502 --> 00:15:22.505
I would know blindfolded.
I'm five miles from home.

139
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:30.138
Was she worth it?

140
00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.474
Worth dying for.

141
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:56.622
- Come on, boy, run!
- You're dog's meat, son!

142
00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:29.113
You're dog's meat, son,
do you know that?

143
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:32.408
Get down here!
You know what you've done.

144
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:35.119
Come down here!
Down!

145
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:39.457
You're not playing by the rules, boy.
Deer don't climb trees.

146
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:43.586
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

147
00:16:43.711 --> 00:16:45.796
- Shall we teach him to fly?
- Yeah!

148
00:16:47.173 --> 00:16:48.174
Get him down.

149
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:50.718
Hold.

150
00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:57.266
I'm curious as to what manner of creature
is so fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

151
00:16:58.017 --> 00:17:00.603
Stranger, this is no affair of yours.

152
00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:03.648
Well, have we treed
the devil himself? Let me see.

153
00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:08.152
A small boy,
a truly dangerous animal.

154
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:12.114
This boy killed one
of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

155
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.824
You starve us!
We needed the meat.

156
00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:18.287
Look, I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the sheriff's land.

157
00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.413
Wrong.

158
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.791
This is my land and my tree.

159
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:25.670
Therefore whatever's in it
also belongs to me.

160
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:31.676
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

161
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.804
Robin of Locksley.

162
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:42.186
Well, well... Locksley.

163
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:44.522
Welcome home.

164
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.151
- Kill him!
- To arms, swords!

165
00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.237
- Come on, hurry up!
- He's armed!

166
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.533
Azeem!
It's time to redeem that vow!

167
00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:58.869
Unleash the hounds!

168
00:18:00.454 --> 00:18:02.081
Get off your damn knees!

169
00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.712
Look out!

170
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.678
Yeah!

171
00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:25.563
Now, sir, if you'd be so kind
as to give me your name

172
00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:26.772
before I run you through.

173
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:30.735
Guy of Gisborne, the sheriff's cousin.

174
00:18:33.279 --> 00:18:36.449
- That little bastard was poaching deer.
- Poach?

175
00:18:36.574 --> 00:18:39.035
Is it not a greater crime
to starve a family?

176
00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.788
Go on, Locksley.

177
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:44.582
Go on.

178
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.211
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

179
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.049
Now get off my land.

180
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:04.060
Tell Nottingham what happens to his scum
when they pick on small children.

181
00:19:07.188 --> 00:19:08.689
You.

182
00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:12.526
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered?

183
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.696
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

184
00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:18.824
Which does not include prayer times
or meal times

185
00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.202
or any time I'm outnumbered 6 to 1.

186
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.329
You whine like a mule.

187
00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.582
You are still alive.

188
00:19:33.255 --> 00:19:34.924
Have no fear.
Come down, boy.

189
00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.848
Is it true, boy?
Did you kill a deer?

190
00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.352
Hundreds of them.

191
00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.109
You scared him.

192
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:02.451
Interesting place, this... England.

193
00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:26.225
Hold up, Sir Guy.
The sheriff's not to be disturbed.

194
00:20:35.067 --> 00:20:36.402
Cousin.

195
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:40.656
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

196
00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:46.871
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

197
00:20:46.996 --> 00:20:49.165
Who told you to cover up?

198
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.834
His name?

199
00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:53.961
Robin of Locksley.

200
00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.547
The prodigal son returns.

201
00:20:56.672 --> 00:20:59.508
He's a whelp!
This girl could best him.

202
00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:01.385
Put it there!

203
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:09.268
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

204
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:14.398
Yes, well,
your men were probably drunk.

205
00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:16.108
Yet you survived, cousin.

206
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.611
I barely survived.

207
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.868
...markings of Islam.

208
00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:30.706
Yes, yes, I'm sure it will take an army
to match these rogues.

209
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:35.336
I trust Locksley to visit his manor
and find the home fires still burning.

210
00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:40.716
Time for portents, cousin.

211
00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:53.020
Mortianna?

212
00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.539
Shut up.

213
00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.717
You called, madam?

214
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:37.857
Shh...

215
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:57.459
What do you see?

216
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:03.215
- The son of a dead man.
- Locksley.

217
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.927
- Does he affect us?
- He precedes the Lionheart.

218
00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:12.016
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
That could prove a bit awkward

219
00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.894
and will soften the spines
of the barons. Soon?

220
00:23:15.019 --> 00:23:16.520
Make haste.

221
00:23:17.229 --> 00:23:19.231
But my plan is still intact?

222
00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:24.528
What is wrong?

223
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.989
I have seen our death.

224
00:23:28.574 --> 00:23:31.827
The painted man,
he haunts my dreams.

225
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:35.873
Adorned with strange,
foreign markings.

226
00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:38.125
Locksley's companion!

227
00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:42.713
Kill him. Kill them both.

228
00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.597
Father?

229
00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.935
Father! Anyone here?

230
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:58.854
Duncan!

231
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:01.565
Father!

232
00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:13.827
No.

233
00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:19.249
No!

234
00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:22.544
- Who is it?
- It's my father.

235
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.427
Who's there?

236
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:33.764
Who's there?

237
00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:35.641
Master Robin?

238
00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:39.520
- Is that you?
- Duncan?

239
00:24:40.187 --> 00:24:43.941
Praise be! I thought God
had abandoned us.

240
00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:47.027
- Duncan, my father...
- It's a miracle!

241
00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:49.238
Why... why didn't you cut him down?

242
00:24:49.363 --> 00:24:51.198
It's a miracle, I never thought...

243
00:24:51.323 --> 00:24:54.326
- Damn you, Duncan, are you deaf?
- Easy!

244
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:56.787
Look at him.

245
00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:00.165
I would have done if I could see.

246
00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:06.463
Who did this to you, Duncan?

247
00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:09.758
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

248
00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:11.802
With the sheriff and his witch
looking on.

249
00:25:13.387 --> 00:25:14.388
Why?

250
00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:18.308
They say that the sheriff
captured your father worshipping the devil.

251
00:25:18.434 --> 00:25:21.812
That he signed a confession
before the bishop.

252
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:26.108
No, that's not possible.

253
00:25:26.233 --> 00:25:30.154
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

254
00:25:30.946 --> 00:25:33.365
Did you believe the charges?

255
00:25:34.324 --> 00:25:37.369
Not even when they took my eyes.

256
00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.466
We must go.

257
00:25:53.927 --> 00:25:57.681
He loved you to the end, young master.

258
00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.559
He never gave up hope of your return.

259
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:02.686
I should have been here.

260
00:26:05.272 --> 00:26:08.275
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

261
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:12.613
He said it was vanity
to force other men to our religion.

262
00:26:13.614 --> 00:26:15.282
But you must flee now.

263
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:18.994
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

264
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.954
I hear you, Duncan.

265
00:26:22.915 --> 00:26:25.084
You should go home.

266
00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:28.295
My world is turned upside down here.

267
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.423
I cannot ask you to come
where I am going.

268
00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:35.135
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

269
00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:40.933
Besides... there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

270
00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:49.775
I will not rest
until my father's avenged!

271
00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:58.408
I swear it... by my own blood.

272
00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:12.005
What is this place?

273
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:13.757
Peter's home.

274
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:16.885
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

275
00:27:17.427 --> 00:27:19.763
We'll find food and shelter here.

276
00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:26.145
No more beggars!

277
00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:38.282
Tell the mistress of the house
that Robin of Locksley is at her door.

278
00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:40.617
Her ladyship's not here.

279
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:44.246
Is the child Marian at home?

280
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:46.623
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

281
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:53.338
The hospitality in this country
is as warm as the weather.

282
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.302
- It's a joke.
- Really?

283
00:27:58.427 --> 00:28:00.262
Leave your weapons.

284
00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:04.766
Just you.

285
00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:21.450
Wait here.

286
00:28:22.868 --> 00:28:24.369
Right here?

287
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.587
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

288
00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:38.717
Were it not for their ungodly ways,
Master Robin would never have left.

289
00:28:42.012 --> 00:28:44.848
What manner of name is Azeem?

290
00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.643
Irish? Cornish?

291
00:28:48.644 --> 00:28:50.062
Moorish.

292
00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:56.068
Who are you?

293
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.821
Robin of Locksley.

294
00:28:59.947 --> 00:29:01.448
You lie. Robin is dead.

295
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.158
Step into the light.

296
00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.916
Turn around.

297
00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.381
Am I to dance next?

298
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:23.095
- Who are you?
- I am the Maid Marian.

299
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.722
Well, then show yourself, child,
for we knew each other well.

300
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:40.862
The years have... been kind.

301
00:29:40.988 --> 00:29:42.823
Thank you.

302
00:29:42.948 --> 00:29:46.660
With the king away,
we must guard against villainous outlaws

303
00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.495
who would kidnap a relative of his.

304
00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.747
Surely you can see
that I am not one of those.

305
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:52.708
Perhaps.

306
00:29:53.917 --> 00:29:55.502
Now remove yourself from this house.

307
00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:00.549
I would, my lady,
but I'm sworn to protect you.

308
00:30:01.758 --> 00:30:03.593
Protect me?

309
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:07.014
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

310
00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:13.687
And besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

311
00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:15.647
Marian, wait!

312
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:21.278
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

313
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.042
Point me toward danger, Azeem!
I'm ready!

314
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:08.367
Oh!

315
00:31:11.495 --> 00:31:13.580
Hello, Marian.

316
00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:23.632
His last thoughts were of you.

317
00:31:28.345 --> 00:31:30.180
Oh, Peter.

318
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.852
I'm sorry, Marian.

319
00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.522
I'm sorry.

320
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.276
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save your own skin?

321
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:47.280
No one feels his loss more than I.

322
00:31:47.406 --> 00:31:50.909
Next time I visit London, I'll be sure
to convey your condolences to my mother.

323
00:31:53.495 --> 00:31:57.416
I would think for your safety
that you would join her there.

324
00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:00.127
No, I have no interest
in life at court.

325
00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:03.296
All that gossipmongering
and currying favour.

326
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:06.550
But you're alone here.

327
00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:11.930
Hardly. These years
have left us many in need.

328
00:32:13.098 --> 00:32:15.308
While you and my brother
were off playing boy heroes,

329
00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:17.185
Nottingham has plundered the shire.

330
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.479
I see you still have your lands.

331
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:23.900
Because I give him
no excuse to take them.

332
00:32:25.485 --> 00:32:26.570
I am the king's cousin.

333
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:29.197
It is my station to look after these people
until his return.

334
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.245
Marian.

335
00:32:36.371 --> 00:32:37.706
Marian.

336
00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:40.083
Marian.

337
00:32:41.918 --> 00:32:45.755
My purpose in coming here
was not to hurt you.

338
00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:50.594
I swore... I swore to your brother
that I would protect you.

339
00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:53.972
You cannot replace my brother.

340
00:32:54.097 --> 00:32:55.182
I...

341
00:32:55.891 --> 00:32:57.642
I don't want to replace him.

342
00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:02.063
I've returned to find my home to find
it destroyed and my father murdered.

343
00:33:02.189 --> 00:33:06.193
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old blind man.

344
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:14.993
All I remember of you is a spoiled bully
who used to burn my hair as a child.

345
00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:20.290
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

346
00:33:24.586 --> 00:33:28.089
Robin, whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe...

347
00:33:29.216 --> 00:33:31.468
...what they accused him of.

348
00:33:31.593 --> 00:33:33.595
I don't.

349
00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.388
Christian!

350
00:33:44.397 --> 00:33:45.899
Look.

351
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.526
Look!

352
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:13.718
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

353
00:34:13.843 --> 00:34:15.262
God knows.

354
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:16.471
What is it?

355
00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:27.983
- What is it?
- It's Nottingham's soldiers.

356
00:34:28.108 --> 00:34:30.151
Coming here?
Is this your protection?

357
00:34:31.361 --> 00:34:34.614
- I killed some of the sheriff's men.
- Oh, dear.

358
00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.659
- I fear I have placed you in danger.
- Mmm...

359
00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:39.536
I can take care of myself.
Just go!

360
00:34:39.661 --> 00:34:42.163
No, that's my horse!

361
00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:44.874
A truly magnificent animal, my lady.

362
00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.588
Come on!

363
00:34:51.464 --> 00:34:54.634
- Go!
- I said, I'm sworn to protect you.

364
00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:58.763
- And I say no more boyish gestures.
- I'm not leaving.

365
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.061
Stop them!
They're stealing my horses!

366
00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:07.814
- You're so kind, Marian.
- Ooh!

367
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:29.377
Been sheltering outlaws,
Lady Marian?

368
00:35:29.502 --> 00:35:34.007
- They're thieves, you imbecile.
- Lucky he didn't steal your virtue as well.

369
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:37.469
A crown to the man who brings me
Locksley's head! My lady.

370
00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:22.472
Have we lost them?

371
00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:25.141
No!

372
00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:29.396
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We cannot outrun them.

373
00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:32.524
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

374
00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:37.862
- We can lose them in the forest.
- Sherwood Forest is haunted, Master.

375
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:41.366
Either we take our chances with the ghosts
or become ghosts ourselves.

376
00:37:04.013 --> 00:37:06.474
Come on, damn you!
There are only three of them!

377
00:37:07.183 --> 00:37:11.104
It's not the men we fear, sir.
It's the evil spirits.

378
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:13.314
Robin of the Hood!

379
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.317
Son of a devil worship per!

380
00:37:16.443 --> 00:37:20.739
Your father died a coward cursing
your name and squealing like a stuck pig!

381
00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.409
You will bring no justice to your father
by dying today.

382
00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:56.816
Master Robin?

383
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.444
There are your ghosts, Duncan.

384
00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:04.324
Wind chimes.
A child's toy put to good use.

385
00:38:05.575 --> 00:38:08.328
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

386
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.876
This forest has eyes.

387
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.753
I swear it.

388
00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:39.275
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

389
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:43.112
Then imagine a way to cross it.

390
00:39:15.228 --> 00:39:16.813
There's hope!

391
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.445
♪ There was a rich man
from Nottingham

392
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:26.823
♪ Who tried to cross the river

393
00:39:26.948 --> 00:39:28.992
♪ What a dope,
he tripped on a rope

394
00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:31.703
♪ Now look at him shiver ♪

395
00:39:31.828 --> 00:39:34.581
Beg for mercy, rich man!

396
00:39:37.959 --> 00:39:40.044
I beg of no man.

397
00:39:47.969 --> 00:39:50.597
Well, this here is our river,

398
00:39:50.722 --> 00:39:54.100
and any man who wishes to cross
must pay a tax.

399
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.310
Yeah.

400
00:39:55.435 --> 00:39:57.270
I will pay no tax.

401
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.482
As you can see, I have nothing.

402
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.944
- Not even my sword.
- Bollocks!

403
00:40:05.778 --> 00:40:11.451
Any man who travels with two servants
and claims he's got no bloody money

404
00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:13.536
is either a fool or a liar.

405
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:16.414
Yeah, he's a liar!

406
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:19.375
- Who are you?
- John Little.

407
00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:23.630
Best man of the woods.
Eh, lads?

408
00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:26.174
- Tell him, John!
- That's right!

409
00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:30.762
Well, best man,
you lead this rabble?

410
00:40:30.887 --> 00:40:31.971
Whoa!

411
00:40:32.096 --> 00:40:34.349
Yes, I do, mate.

412
00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:37.477
And if you tosspots
want to travel through Sherwood Forest,

413
00:40:37.602 --> 00:40:41.606
it's gonna cost you...
that gold medallion.

414
00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:48.237
This is sacred to me.

415
00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:51.449
It's sacred to us too, mate.

416
00:40:51.574 --> 00:40:54.827
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

417
00:40:54.953 --> 00:40:57.747
- You'll have to fight me for it.
- Whoa!

418
00:40:57.872 --> 00:40:59.707
Love to, mate.

419
00:41:06.089 --> 00:41:10.551
Be careful, Father.
He walloped 12 of the sheriff's men.

420
00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:12.845
Is that so?

421
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:14.722
Reckon I'm going to enjoy this.

422
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.308
Hey.

423
00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:20.478
That's your father?

424
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:26.734
You should help me.

425
00:41:50.758 --> 00:41:52.343
Wee!

426
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:55.263
He's drowning!

427
00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:58.725
Lost something?

428
00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:03.021
Thanks for the taxes.

429
00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:07.442
Looks like the little rich boy
is lost for words, eh?

430
00:42:08.568 --> 00:42:12.488
- Any great ideas?
- Get up! Move faster!

431
00:42:13.406 --> 00:42:15.450
Move faster. Great idea.

432
00:42:23.124 --> 00:42:24.959
Watch it, John!

433
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:32.508
- We're not through yet.
- All right, my old cooker.

434
00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:35.970
You want another good walloping?
You shall have one.

435
00:42:48.858 --> 00:42:51.110
Seems I've made it
past the gate, John Little.

436
00:42:51.235 --> 00:42:55.573
- Or should I call you... Little John?
- Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

437
00:43:05.792 --> 00:43:07.877
- You can do it!
- Good shot!

438
00:43:08.836 --> 00:43:11.839
You've bloodied him, John,
you've bloodied him.

439
00:43:18.096 --> 00:43:20.389
Swimming time again, old chum.

440
00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:38.116
Where is he?
Do you see him?

441
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:52.755
It's a blooming shame!

442
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.924
He was a brave lad!

443
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:02.056
Help!

444
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.685
- Do you yield?
- I can't bloody swim!

445
00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.564
- Do you yield?
- Yes!

446
00:44:09.689 --> 00:44:13.359
Good. Now put your feet down.

447
00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:19.866
I'll be buggered.

448
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:24.829
- The medallion.
- Give me your name first.

449
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:27.665
Robin of Locksley.

450
00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:33.254
Well, Robin of Locksley,
you got balls of solid rock.

451
00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:34.380
Come on.

452
00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:42.096
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell.

453
00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:46.309
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads all calls him Bull.

454
00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.979
- Because you're short?
- Nope.

455
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:52.857
It's because I'm so long!

456
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.573
- Here, have a look.
- No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

457
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.826
Give the man some mead.

458
00:45:06.996 --> 00:45:08.831
Now, I made that myself.

459
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:14.337
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years

460
00:45:14.462 --> 00:45:17.131
that a friend of mine
is not welcome at this table?

461
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:19.258
But he's a savage, sire!

462
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.303
That he is.

463
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:26.724
But no more than you or I.

464
00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:30.811
And don't call me sire.

465
00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:36.400
With regret, I must decline.

466
00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:40.279
- Allah forbids it.
- Your bloody loss, mate.

467
00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:43.741
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

468
00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:47.286
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

469
00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.247
Even the young lad there.

470
00:45:49.372 --> 00:45:52.291
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

471
00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:58.047
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

472
00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.841
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

473
00:46:07.223 --> 00:46:08.391
We can always fight back.

474
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:15.439
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

475
00:46:15.564 --> 00:46:18.150
These are all good lads here.

476
00:46:18.276 --> 00:46:20.361
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

477
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:25.199
It'd be Iambs to the slaughter.

478
00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:28.202
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

479
00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:30.413
- A witch?
- She knows every man's thoughts.

480
00:46:30.538 --> 00:46:32.373
You can see right through her.
And she flies.

481
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.583
That's a load of codswallop, Wulf.

482
00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:36.502
What does the rich son
of a devil worship per

483
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:38.838
care what happens
to a band of outlaw peasants?

484
00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.881
My lord
was a kind and generous man!

485
00:46:41.007 --> 00:46:44.343
Who among you
dares believe him capable...

486
00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.846
My father was no devil worship per.

487
00:46:48.264 --> 00:46:51.267
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

488
00:46:54.353 --> 00:46:56.188
But he's right.

489
00:46:58.316 --> 00:47:00.151
I was a rich man's son.

490
00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:05.323
But when I killed the sheriff's men...

491
00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:09.660
- ... I became an outlaw like you.
- You are nothing like us.

492
00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:15.374
That there is Will Scarlett.

493
00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.501
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

494
00:47:19.462 --> 00:47:21.797
Come on, lads, drink up.

495
00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:24.133
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

496
00:47:24.258 --> 00:47:28.095
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

497
00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.056
Here we're safe.

498
00:47:31.057 --> 00:47:33.976
Here we are kings.

499
00:47:59.251 --> 00:48:02.755
- Too much mead, old friend?
- Forgive me, I oversleep.

500
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.383
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

501
00:48:14.475 --> 00:48:18.312
- What day is it, Duncan?
- Sunday, I think.

502
00:48:20.106 --> 00:48:22.525
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

503
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:24.068
That they do.

504
00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:27.780
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

505
00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:46.090
Well, my other god calls.

506
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:50.511
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

507
00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:54.932
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

508
00:48:55.057 --> 00:48:58.811
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

509
00:49:01.021 --> 00:49:06.777
Although... frankly, sometimes...

510
00:49:07.695 --> 00:49:10.698
... I can't see much difference.

511
00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:18.539
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

512
00:49:18.664 --> 00:49:21.000
Their dying wish.

513
00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:06.420
We beseech thy blessing, Lord,
on all your people, but most especially

514
00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:12.384
...on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

515
00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:19.517
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect our glorious city.

516
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:25.105
Grant him also the strength
to bring to justice the lawless men

517
00:50:26.106 --> 00:50:30.528
who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

518
00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:36.742
And the judgment to punish them
in your name. Amen.

519
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.620
Amen.

520
00:50:39.745 --> 00:50:41.580
Go in peace.

521
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.882
- Sarah?
- Yes.

522
00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:57.555
- That's all I have.
- God bless you, ma'am.

523
00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:18.659
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

524
00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:22.538
For one who cannot see your beauty?

525
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:28.877
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

526
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:31.505
Searching my soul.

527
00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:35.342
I do not wish
to be seen with an outlaw.

528
00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:37.553
Do you prefer
the company of Nottingham?

529
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.179
There's a price on your head.

530
00:51:39.305 --> 00:51:42.057
- How much?
- One hundred gold pieces.

531
00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:44.018
Is that all?

532
00:51:44.143 --> 00:51:48.147
I shall have to annoy the good sheriff more.
Soon it will be 1,000.

533
00:51:48.272 --> 00:51:50.691
For 1,000, I would turn you in myself.

534
00:51:51.734 --> 00:51:53.485
Nottingham is mounting an army.

535
00:51:53.611 --> 00:51:57.781
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and arm our.

536
00:51:57.906 --> 00:52:00.242
- What is he planning?
- I don't know.

537
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.078
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

538
00:52:05.205 --> 00:52:07.958
- Go. Quickly, go!
- Thank you.

539
00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:10.669
Robin, do something for me.

540
00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.671
- What?
- Take a bath.

541
00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:13.922
Take a bath?

542
00:52:34.234 --> 00:52:37.404
These are my private chambers, my son.

543
00:52:38.364 --> 00:52:41.533
I have priests
who would hear your confession.

544
00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:43.160
- Ah!
- Shh.

545
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:51.794
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

546
00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:55.547
Welcome home, Robin.

547
00:52:57.675 --> 00:53:00.344
You shine like the sun, my lady.

548
00:53:00.469 --> 00:53:03.389
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

549
00:53:03.514 --> 00:53:07.768
My cousin tells me
the knave deprived you of some horses.

550
00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:10.979
- Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
- Yes, I know.

551
00:53:11.105 --> 00:53:13.065
And for inflicting that upon you

552
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.943
I'm going to hang him
from the walls by his own entrails.

553
00:53:16.068 --> 00:53:17.569
I'd like to see that, my lord.

554
00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:19.780
If you'd bring your household
within the city walls

555
00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:22.574
I could give your every need
my personal attention.

556
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:27.204
I do thank you, my lord, but I much prefer
to stay in my family's home for now.

557
00:53:29.123 --> 00:53:31.375
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honour

558
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.754
of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

559
00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:37.673
Oh!

560
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:39.216
Why?

561
00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:44.012
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

562
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:46.140
Yes. Er...

563
00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:49.685
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

564
00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:51.979
I fear for his safe return.

565
00:53:52.104 --> 00:53:54.857
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

566
00:53:54.982 --> 00:53:59.403
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

567
00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:08.829
I asked your father three times
if he worshipped the dark one

568
00:54:08.954 --> 00:54:13.125
because his answer
vexed me so grievously.

569
00:54:14.209 --> 00:54:20.966
He said... he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

570
00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:31.977
You lie.

571
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:43.155
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

572
00:54:50.287 --> 00:54:52.456
You bastard! In there!

573
00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:54.917
Get him!

574
00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:02.174
Locksley!

575
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.345
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

576
00:55:07.221 --> 00:55:08.305
Then it begins.

577
00:55:24.655 --> 00:55:28.242
- He's taking the sheriff's horse!
- He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

578
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.913
Close that gate!

579
00:55:33.997 --> 00:55:37.960
The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

580
00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:58.438
What are you looking at?

581
00:56:10.951 --> 00:56:13.537
There's a rider coming.

582
00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:20.252
Water!

583
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:23.213
- Thank you.
- For the animal.

584
00:56:23.338 --> 00:56:27.342
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

585
00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:32.723
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know... great one.

586
00:56:32.848 --> 00:56:34.850
I prefer to have the choice.

587
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:36.977
Wonderful!
You've stolen the sheriff's horse?

588
00:56:37.102 --> 00:56:40.355
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

589
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.150
- Are you afraid, John?
- Yeah, a little.

590
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:47.613
Well, so is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

591
00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:51.992
- You fool! You've started a war!
- We're already at war.

592
00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:55.787
Duncan... bread.

593
00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:01.168
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes

594
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:03.462
- and would hunt our children.
- We?

595
00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.506
You planning to join us then, matey?

596
00:57:07.883 --> 00:57:08.967
No, to lead you.

597
00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:15.933
Christian.

598
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:18.226
These are simple people.

599
00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:20.520
They are not warriors.

600
00:57:20.646 --> 00:57:23.649
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

601
00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:28.111
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

602
00:57:30.572 --> 00:57:33.825
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an axe?

603
00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:38.288
Because it's dull, you twit!
It'll hurt more!

604
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:41.833
I want this brigand found.

605
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:43.627
Starve them out!

606
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:46.588
Slaughter their...
No, take their livestock.

607
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:50.133
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

608
00:57:50.258 --> 00:57:53.345
Well, perhaps we could create
a name for him.

609
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.722
Something to drive fear into the hearts
of the populace.

610
00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:58.475
Maybe "Locksley the Lethal"
or "Wreaking Robin".

611
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:01.144
Whatever. I want him dead
by the next full moon,

612
00:58:01.269 --> 00:58:03.689
before the barons come back.

613
00:58:03.814 --> 00:58:05.649
Now sew!

614
00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:10.362
And keep the stitches small.

615
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:31.341
He's not here, sir.

616
00:58:32.217 --> 00:58:34.553
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

617
00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:38.557
- He died last winter.
- Burn it down!

618
00:58:45.147 --> 00:58:48.567
Leave us the sow.
Her young will feed us through winter.

619
00:58:48.692 --> 00:58:52.404
- You heard of the Sherwood bandit?
- Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.

620
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:55.699
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

621
00:59:02.164 --> 00:59:03.749
Over here!

622
00:59:06.668 --> 00:59:09.921
Alfred!
What's happened to you?

623
00:59:14.134 --> 00:59:17.095
- Oh, John!
- Fanny!

624
00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:20.557
- Will, they burned it, all of it.
- Are you all right?

625
00:59:21.516 --> 00:59:23.769
Where is this Robin Hood?

626
00:59:24.519 --> 00:59:25.687
He's there.

627
00:59:27.272 --> 00:59:30.150
Look! Look what they've done!

628
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:39.201
If it's fame you seek, Christian,
I think you have it.

629
00:59:42.162 --> 00:59:44.998
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

630
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:49.377
- It's Nottingham trying to divide us.
- We are divided, rich boy.

631
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:51.338
I'm not blind as that old man
over there.

632
00:59:51.463 --> 00:59:54.883
You're still trying
to be lord of the manor.

633
00:59:55.008 --> 01:00:00.013
I heard today that the sheriff
now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.

634
01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:03.100
I say we take him in.

635
01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:04.976
- Yeah.
- Let's do that.

636
01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:09.231
Will, do you think that the sheriff
will give everything back after I'm gone?

637
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:13.235
- He'll give us the reward and our pardons.
- Wrong!

638
01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:18.281
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

639
01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.076
Well, what would you have us do?

640
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:25.622
Fight armoured men on horseback
with-with... with rocks and our bare hands?

641
01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.582
If needs be.

642
01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.753
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you, Will.

643
01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.172
Courage.

644
01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.890
Look out!

645
01:00:58.363 --> 01:00:59.865
Thank you, Wulf.

646
01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:03.368
- You wish to end this?
- Yeah.

647
01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.078
- You wish to go home?
- Aye.

648
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.416
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves

649
01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.126
and face that the price for it
may be dear.

650
01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:17.174
I, for one, would rather die
than spend my life in hiding.

651
01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:20.468
The sheriff calls us outlaws.

652
01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:23.013
But I say we are free.

653
01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:29.060
And one free man defending his home
is more powerful than ten hired soldiers.

654
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.773
The Crusades taught me that.

655
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.529
I will make you no promises save one.

656
01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:44.951
That if you truly believe
in your hearts that you are free...

657
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.662
...then I say we can win.

658
01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.832
- They got arm our!
- Yeah.

659
01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.084
They got arm our, Bull?

660
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.338
Even this boy can be taught to find
the chinks in every suit of arm our.

661
01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.465
But we ain't got nothing to eat!

662
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.676
What do we need
that the forest cannot provide?

663
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.137
We have food.
Wood for weapons.

664
01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.515
We'll find safety and solace
in her trees.

665
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:12.062
Yeah, but what about our kin?
Sheriff's taken all they got too!

666
01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:17.484
Then, by God, we take it back.

667
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.496
Hoo-hoo!

668
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.541
Haw!

669
01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.962
Whoa!

670
01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.090
What's the meaning of this?

671
01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:08.428
Milady... a woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

672
01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.597
How dare you!

673
01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.693
Please don't take that!
Please don't take that!

674
01:04:23.818 --> 01:04:29.240
- Please, sir! Those belong to our Lord.
- Now they belong to my lord sheriff!

675
01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.464
Give it back.

676
01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:49.386
Good. Tell the sheriff for every harm
he does these people,

677
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:52.389
I will visit it back on him tenfold.

678
01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.900
Something vexes thee?

679
01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:16.329
What the devil?

680
01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:20.708
It is a hot day, my friend, to burden
your horse with such a heavy purse.

681
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.628
The sheriff will hear of this!

682
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.134
I truly hope so.

683
01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:40.145
There you go, love.
Buy yourself a new sow.

684
01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:44.983
God bless you, Fanny.
And God bless Robin Hood!

685
01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:54.325
We reckon he's nicked three to four
million in the last five months, sire.

686
01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:57.454
All right then, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

687
01:05:57.579 --> 01:05:58.955
Twenty-five thousand crowns.

688
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:04.085
Begging your pardon, sire,
it won't do no good how much you raise it.

689
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.712
Really, scribe, and why is that?

690
01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:10.425
Because, sire, the poor, you see...
he gives them what he takes.

691
01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:13.887
So, well, sire... they love him.

692
01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.975
Just a minute.

693
01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.270
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket

694
01:06:22.395 --> 01:06:25.356
forcing me to hurt the public

695
01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.900
and they love him for it?

696
01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.820
Yes.

697
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.740
That's it then!

698
01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.700
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans.

699
01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.412
No more merciful beheadings.

700
01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.414
And call off Christmas!

701
01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:45.043
The treasury is empty.

702
01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.462
All day and all night
people plague my door

703
01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:51.424
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

704
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:53.718
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken."

705
01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.346
It's the shortest route to London, sire!

706
01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:58.640
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

707
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.520
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire?

708
01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.064
No camp. Nothing!

709
01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:12.195
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

710
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.824
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.
You, 10:45.

711
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:18.785
Bring a friend.

712
01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.096
Tongue offends thee.

713
01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:41.808
- Whose?
- One who writes all.

714
01:07:42.934 --> 01:07:44.602
One who...?

715
01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:49.983
- That horrible little scribe, his tongue?
- Cut it out.

716
01:08:19.887 --> 01:08:21.639
How many?

717
01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.182
Twenty.

718
01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.934
Twenty?

719
01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:26.561
How many?

720
01:08:27.645 --> 01:08:29.147
Five.

721
01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:32.567
- They can't count anyway.
- Come on.

722
01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.527
Why scare them?

723
01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.030
And they call me barbarian.

724
01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:47.665
- Friar!
- Huh?

725
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.710
You shall find it much more difficult
to sing with a sword in your gullet.

726
01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:54.339
Yes, my lord.

727
01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.341
You pig.

728
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.052
Will you shut up about it
and help me move this log!

729
01:08:59.177 --> 01:09:00.762
This ain't a log, this is a tree!

730
01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:02.221
Shut up!
You're supposed to be helping me!

731
01:09:02.347 --> 01:09:05.350
I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!

732
01:09:12.065 --> 01:09:14.901
You men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

733
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:19.947
On to glory!

734
01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.506
Bastards.
Come on, find them!

735
01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.019
Ooh...

736
01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.544
Go. Now! Now!

737
01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.841
Now!

738
01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:24.011
Welcome to Sherwood, Friar!
Giddy-up!

739
01:10:50.329 --> 01:10:53.291
Surrender your weapons!

740
01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.627
Surrender your weapons,
and I give you my word you shall go free.

741
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.588
No, don't do that!

742
01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.926
What are you...?

743
01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.028
I'll be buggered!

744
01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:26.282
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

745
01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.716
Good morning, my reverend friend.

746
01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:48.763
You travel with poor company
when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.

747
01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:50.431
Tax him! Tax him!

748
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:56.938
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

749
01:11:57.939 --> 01:11:59.690
- That's right.
- Robin Hood!

750
01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.654
Lord bless me. I, er...

751
01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:08.449
I mistook you for common thieves!

752
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.326
Kindly let me pass, sir.

753
01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:16.624
Surely the Lord has the charity to spare
a few barrels for good Christian men. Yes?

754
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.585
We have much to celebrate.

755
01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:23.840
Well, if you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

756
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.843
...you must best me for it!

757
01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:28.970
Hee-haw!

758
01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.185
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver,

759
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:40.231
holier and wiser man
than thou art!

760
01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:00.167
He giveth and he taketh away.

761
01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:07.633
Do you yield?

762
01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:14.849
I'd rather roast in hell.

763
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.520
Shoot him! Shoot him!

764
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.914
I think the good friar
has taken us far enough.

765
01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:39.248
Well done, Friar.

766
01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:43.628
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

767
01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:55.097
- Well, Tuck...
- Thanks for the beer.

768
01:13:55.222 --> 01:13:58.059
...are these not
the meek of the earth?

769
01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:01.312
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

770
01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:04.148
What say you, Friar?

771
01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:11.530
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

772
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.119
- I accept.
- Good. You will not regret it.

773
01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.330
Aye, but you may!

774
01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:54.615
We were... ambushed, cousin.

775
01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:03.416
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

776
01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.545
Any losses?

777
01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.505
Some.

778
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:16.053
In truth, all of them.

779
01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.015
- And the gold?
- Taken.

780
01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.518
Robin Hood?

781
01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:25.646
They were woodsmen, cousin.

782
01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:29.608
Robin Hood.

783
01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:36.032
- I... I tried.
- Cousin.

784
01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:41.245
- I tried. I tried.
- Cousin, we must be strong.

785
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:44.957
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

786
01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:49.587
And I can't allow a lieutenant
to fail me.

787
01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:07.688
Well, at least I didn't use a spoon.

788
01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.609
That's good steel.

789
01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:22.828
- Much?
- Huh?

790
01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:25.206
- Take the one on the left.
- Which one's left?

791
01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.003
- Which one you taking?
- What do you mean?

792
01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.547
If you're taking the one on the left,
I'm taking the one on the right.

793
01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:37.718
- Which one's the one on the right?
- The one next to the one on the...

794
01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.305
Bollocks. We'll just jump out
and grab them.

795
01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.850
- Now?
- Now! Now!

796
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.644
Oh, God!

797
01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:47.978
Donation, if you please.

798
01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.981
Donation? For what?

799
01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.901
What?

800
01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:58.072
- Er... for passage through Sherwood.
- Very well.

801
01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:02.493
- Come and get it.
- Eh?

802
01:17:06.789 --> 01:17:09.542
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us?

803
01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:13.587
- It's me job, my lady.
- Job? And who is your employer?

804
01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:15.589
Robin Hood.

805
01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:22.096
I insist on seeing him at once.

806
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:25.391
No! I'm trying to stop them!

807
01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.351
No, you cannot go down there!

808
01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:30.229
Don't rush, you'll fall, my lady.

809
01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.941
- He's not expecting you!
- My lady's intrusion is simply tit for tat.

810
01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.318
- Out of the way, old trout!
- Don't "old trout" me!

811
01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:38.445
I told you,
you can't go down there!

812
01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:49.039
- Ooh! Oh, I say.
- Cover your eyes.

813
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.667
My lady, don't!

814
01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.096
You could've said!

815
01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.810
Robin! You got visitors!

816
01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:15.983
Don't look at me like that,
it weren't my fault!

817
01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.109
Madam, you be careful there.

818
01:18:17.234 --> 01:18:22.448
- It was Much!
- Careful you don't slip.

819
01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.493
Hello.

820
01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:30.873
What are you doing here?

821
01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.128
Taking a lady's advice.

822
01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:38.505
Oh...

823
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:40.633
What happened to your eye, Bull?

824
01:18:40.758 --> 01:18:43.093
- We was set upon by, like, ten...
- Er... twelve!

825
01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.262
Fifteen large, big lads!

826
01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:46.555
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

827
01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:02.112
You've been busy.

828
01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.491
- We have guests!
- Bring them down!

829
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:18.170
It works.

830
01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:20.547
Kind of.

831
01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:22.800
Of course it works.

832
01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:26.262
Great shot!

833
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:29.139
Come on, take your time, now.

834
01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:36.772
That's good, Wulf.
But can you do it amidst distraction?

835
01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:40.276
Can you make the shot
when you must?

836
01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.737
Show him, Wulf.

837
01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.790
Can you?

838
01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:59.169
- Well, go on, then.
- It was a dirty trick.

839
01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:03.382
Aren't we all very serious?
Is his shirt coming off?

840
01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:11.890
Fair's fair. Come on, chaps.
Fair's fair.

841
01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:27.740
Well done. Well done.

842
01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:33.454
This is grain, which any fool can eat,

843
01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:38.751
but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

844
01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:43.255
Let us give praise to our maker
and glory to his bounty

845
01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:46.717
by learning about... beer.

846
01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:56.101
Did you bring me here to brag?

847
01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.940
This is blood money, Marian.

848
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:05.235
It's intended to bribe King Richard's
enemies to unite against him.

849
01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.530
We intercepted it.

850
01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.242
- But who would...?
- Nottingham.

851
01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.912
No... Nottingham would not dare
challenge the king.

852
01:21:15.037 --> 01:21:17.373
Well, the king is not England
to be challenged, is he?

853
01:21:17.498 --> 01:21:19.541
While he's away,
he may lose his country.

854
01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:28.884
You thought... you thought
I was keeping it all, didn't you?

855
01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:31.720
Didn't you?

856
01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.473
Well, here.

857
01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.767
A contribution to your cause.

858
01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:38.977
- Keep it.
- No, this dagger would fetch a great price.

859
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.188
- Keep it.
- No, no, it's not dear to me.

860
01:21:41.313 --> 01:21:43.816
I... well, I mean, it is...
Well, it's not.

861
01:21:45.025 --> 01:21:47.403
Oh, I'm saying everything wrong.
I'll, er...

862
01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.990
Cheers.

863
01:21:58.247 --> 01:22:00.082
How do I get down?

864
01:22:04.545 --> 01:22:06.046
Wait! Wait!

865
01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:11.051
We don't go that way anymore.

866
01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:12.928
I'm happy to hear that.

867
01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:15.222
- Grab on.
- Mm-hmm.

868
01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:17.641
Ooh!

869
01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.768
We have a rule here, you know.

870
01:22:19.893 --> 01:22:23.689
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

871
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.775
There's too many lives at stake.

872
01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.112
That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

873
01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.406
Oh.

874
01:22:33.824 --> 01:22:36.243
Well, perhaps you might join us
for dinner?

875
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.328
Perhaps.

876
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:57.890
<i>Salaam,</i> little one.

877
01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:02.227
- Did God paint you?
- Did God paint me?

878
01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:07.649
- For certain.
- Why?

879
01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:14.281
Because... Allah loves wondrous variety.

880
01:23:16.783 --> 01:23:22.206
You see, that is why
your hair is brown and your...

881
01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:26.001
Keep thy heathen words
away from the ears of this innocent

882
01:23:26.126 --> 01:23:28.212
or you'll answer to me.

883
01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.839
You know nothing of our God.

884
01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:37.596
Is not Allah the god of Abraham
as is your God?

885
01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:40.849
Don't trick me
with twists of the devil's tongue.

886
01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.476
Come, child, come.

887
01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.568
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman

888
01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.281
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

889
01:23:56.406 --> 01:24:00.577
I've seen knights in arm our panic
at the first hint of battle.

890
01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:05.707
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body

891
01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.459
to defend a dying horse.

892
01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.713
Nobility's not a birth right.

893
01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.633
It's defined by one's actions.

894
01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.972
It's interesting to hear you say that.

895
01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:21.932
I didn't.

896
01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.892
My father did.

897
01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:30.899
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

898
01:24:31.024 --> 01:24:32.859
I don't know.

899
01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:40.450
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

900
01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:43.245
I was lost after my mother died.

901
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:46.790
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

902
01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.669
...in the arms of another woman.
A peasant woman.

903
01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.591
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

904
01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.134
So he gave her up?

905
01:24:59.845 --> 01:25:03.682
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

906
01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.607
Anyway, who...

907
01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.109
...who says I'm content?

908
01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:16.987
I have my plans for the future.

909
01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:23.243
- A grander scheme than this?
- No, a simpler one.

910
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:28.415
A home, family... love.

911
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:33.128
Oh, men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

912
01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.255
And when it doesn't,
it is a burden to them.

913
01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:39.593
Robin of the Hood, Prince of Thieves.

914
01:25:41.136 --> 01:25:42.804
Is he capable of love?

915
01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:49.144
Father!

916
01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.230
Father!

917
01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.484
It's Mother, she's dying!

918
01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:08.497
Fanny, your baby has not turned.

919
01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:12.334
It cannot be born without help.

920
01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:15.754
He's the devil's seed
sent to lead us astray.

921
01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:17.381
Don't listen to him.
He'll kill her!

922
01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:22.469
If you do not listen to me
she will certainly die. And the child.

923
01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:28.558
The good friar's done all he can.

924
01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.937
I suggest you let the Moor try.

925
01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:38.985
- So be it.
- Then be it on your head! I warned you.

926
01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:42.781
- Marian.
- Yes?

927
01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:44.741
Get me a needle, thread, water.

928
01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:48.995
- And hurry.
- Yes. Come with me. Come, John!

929
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.876
What are you going to do?

930
01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:59.548
I've seen it many times...
with horses.

931
01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:03.927
With horses?

932
01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:08.432
Bite down. Bite down, yes.

933
01:27:08.557 --> 01:27:11.560
Help me, <i>sadiq.</i>

934
01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.231
Give me your arms.

935
01:27:18.316 --> 01:27:20.318
It will be all right.

936
01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.164
I tell you, John,
the barbarian is killing her.

937
01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:39.504
- No, Father!
- Out of the way, boy!

938
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:42.215
Quick, take him. Take him.

939
01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.388
Here you go.

940
01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:52.601
Ooh... what is it? Ooh, ooh.

941
01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:02.736
Your son, milady.
There you are.

942
01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:14.998
You truly are a great one.

943
01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.544
My son!

944
01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:25.050
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

945
01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.978
Today the Lord has taught me
a fine lesson.

946
01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:40.857
That though I may think I am godly,
I know I am not worldly.

947
01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:43.485
Please. Please.

948
01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.157
Come, my barbarian friend,

949
01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:52.369
so you and I open a barrel together
and do our best to save each other's souls.

950
01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:57.082
- Alas, I am not permitted.
- Well, fine then. You talk, I'll drink.

951
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:03.171
Whoa!

952
01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.926
- Milady!
- Sarah?

953
01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.472
May I have this dance?

954
01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.100
This lady is spoken for.

955
01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:00.020
Why this way?

956
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:03.481
So you cannot find the way back
or be forced to tell others the way.

957
01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:05.025
Oh.

958
01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:10.238
It was good to see you again, Marian.

959
01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:13.116
It was good to be seen.

960
01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.913
I have two favours to ask of you.

961
01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:21.291
One.

962
01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:25.670
Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

963
01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.341
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.

964
01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:31.676
You wish me to leave, Master Robin?

965
01:30:31.801 --> 01:30:33.303
Old friend, listen to me.

966
01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:37.182
Can you take Lady Marian safely home?

967
01:30:37.307 --> 01:30:39.392
I fear for her safety.

968
01:30:39.517 --> 01:30:41.770
- Of course, sire.
- Good.

969
01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.563
Bull.

970
01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:53.907
- And two?
- Yes, two.

971
01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:59.412
You're King Richard's cousin.

972
01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:04.292
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

973
01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:06.836
He would believe you.

974
01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:09.214
If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

975
01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:13.760
That's true.

976
01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.805
But will you do it for your king?

977
01:31:18.348 --> 01:31:19.349
No.

978
01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:24.562
I'll do it for you.

979
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:47.210
He fancies you, my lady.

980
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:52.924
I am blind, but some things
I can still see.

981
01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:14.404
In ten days' time,
the barons are coming.

982
01:32:14.529 --> 01:32:17.699
Robin Hood has stolen what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

983
01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:22.412
And I am surrounded by fools
who do not realise my obligations.

984
01:32:23.913 --> 01:32:28.126
Tell me, Mortianna... am I thwarted?

985
01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:53.234
Recruit the beasts
that share our god.

986
01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:57.113
Animals?

987
01:32:57.238 --> 01:33:00.658
- From the North.
- You mean Celts.

988
01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.285
They drink the blood of their dead.

989
01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:04.704
Yoke their strength.

990
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:10.794
Hired thugs.

991
01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.965
Brilliant.

992
01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:23.473
Put thine own issue on the throne.

993
01:33:24.641 --> 01:33:26.309
A child? How?

994
01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.019
Ally with royal blood.

995
01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:31.940
Who?

996
01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:49.791
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But one of vital importance.

997
01:33:49.916 --> 01:33:52.669
I understand, my dear lady.

998
01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:56.131
This is my most trusted emissary.

999
01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:57.924
You must travel to France immediately

1000
01:33:58.049 --> 01:34:00.885
and put that directly in the hands
of the king, and him alone.

1001
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:03.346
My lady in waiting shall accompany you.

1002
01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:07.642
My dear, I could not vouch
for her safety.

1003
01:34:07.767 --> 01:34:09.519
The journey is fraught with danger.

1004
01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.479
Yes, I appreciate your concern,
my lord,

1005
01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:14.607
but Sarah's an accomplished rider,
and I insist she go along.

1006
01:34:16.025 --> 01:34:17.610
As you wish.

1007
01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:33.168
What is wrong?

1008
01:34:33.293 --> 01:34:36.212
My horse is favouring his foreleg.

1009
01:35:25.845 --> 01:35:27.680
What's this?

1010
01:35:29.766 --> 01:35:34.187
- An appetiser.
- You promised us wagons of gold.

1011
01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:39.275
Well, there are greater things than gold.

1012
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:45.073
More land and power
than you have ever dreamed of.

1013
01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.200
When I rule this land,

1014
01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:50.995
it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1015
01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:53.539
You get Cornwall,
you can have Wales

1016
01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.833
and Scotland is all yours.

1017
01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.545
You recruit us to treason

1018
01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:02.757
and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1019
01:36:02.882 --> 01:36:05.093
My lords, why risk life and limb

1020
01:36:05.218 --> 01:36:07.971
for a man who cannot even snare
the bandit who marked his pretty face?

1021
01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.848
Why, indeed?

1022
01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:14.143
That's a good point, my lord.

1023
01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:19.107
How can I control England
when I cannot even control my own county?

1024
01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:22.360
I'm bringing in a little help.

1025
01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:26.197
Audred!

1026
01:36:30.827 --> 01:36:32.412
By God.

1027
01:36:33.121 --> 01:36:34.789
You'd ally us with the Celts?

1028
01:36:36.082 --> 01:36:38.918
What can these mercenaries do
that we cannot?

1029
01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:12.035
Very impressive.

1030
01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.495
All right, my lord sheriff,

1031
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:19.042
but you must wed royal kin
before we act.

1032
01:37:19.167 --> 01:37:21.627
Then your claim to the throne
will be...

1033
01:37:23.796 --> 01:37:24.797
...legitimate.

1034
01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:28.217
I'm as good as engaged.

1035
01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:51.991
Duncan, is that you?

1036
01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:57.330
Hello?

1037
01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:03.294
Rebecca?

1038
01:38:05.838 --> 01:38:08.841
Ah! God!

1039
01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:12.762
Nicodemus. Go.
Find mice.

1040
01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:14.180
- Ha-ha!
- Ah!

1041
01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:19.060
I've never seen the breasts
of a noblewoman.

1042
01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:35.910
- Pardon, my lady, we couldn't hold them!
- Someone wants a word with you.

1043
01:38:41.457 --> 01:38:44.877
- No!
- That's it, sir. That's all of them.

1044
01:39:01.102 --> 01:39:02.520
Easy.

1045
01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:09.777
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

1046
01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:59.202
Robin! The warning arrow!

1047
01:40:00.995 --> 01:40:03.664
All is well! It's Duncan!

1048
01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:09.754
Duncan. Duncan.

1049
01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:15.051
What happened?

1050
01:40:15.176 --> 01:40:17.386
I found you, Robin.
Thank God, I did it.

1051
01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:21.015
- Nottingham's men attacked us.
- Marian?

1052
01:40:21.807 --> 01:40:23.643
They took her.

1053
01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:34.529
What is it?

1054
01:40:35.571 --> 01:40:37.740
Over there! Look!

1055
01:40:38.366 --> 01:40:40.368
On the hill!

1056
01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:04.433
- Celts! God help us!
- Allah, be merciful.

1057
01:41:04.559 --> 01:41:08.563
To the trees!
To the trees!

1058
01:41:10.022 --> 01:41:12.024
Celts! They're coming!

1059
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:15.152
Poor old fool
led them straight to us.

1060
01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.239
Hide in the trees!

1061
01:41:19.782 --> 01:41:21.409
Get me prisoners.

1062
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:36.757
Children! Come to me!

1063
01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:56.611
Daddy!

1064
01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.894
My God.

1065
01:44:07.324 --> 01:44:09.160
Save us!

1066
01:44:22.423 --> 01:44:24.425
Come! Hurry!

1067
01:44:25.676 --> 01:44:27.428
Save yourselves!

1068
01:44:31.348 --> 01:44:33.851
We've gotta go, Robin!
We go now!

1069
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:39.440
Move!

1070
01:44:50.367 --> 01:44:53.496
This way, my lambs.
Come on!

1071
01:44:56.165 --> 01:44:58.000
- Got you!
- Hold or I fire!

1072
01:45:02.379 --> 01:45:04.381
It's gold! Gold!

1073
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.971
Fanny!

1074
01:45:13.682 --> 01:45:15.184
Fanny!

1075
01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:19.438
- John!
- Come on, girl!

1076
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:33.911
John!

1077
01:45:45.673 --> 01:45:47.424
Fanny!

1078
01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.094
Go! Save yourself, John!

1079
01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:53.472
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1080
01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:55.307
Go on, John!

1081
01:45:55.432 --> 01:45:57.434
Never!

1082
01:45:58.978 --> 01:46:00.312
Oh, God!

1083
01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:13.033
- OK.
- Oh, thank God.

1084
01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:19.832
- John, you'll have to catch her!
- Come on!

1085
01:46:27.506 --> 01:46:29.341
I got you, girl!

1086
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.851
- Quick! Quick!
- Robin!

1087
01:46:47.693 --> 01:46:48.986
- Come on!
- Come on!

1088
01:46:53.032 --> 01:46:54.617
- Get over here!
- Go on!

1089
01:46:54.742 --> 01:46:57.161
Come on!

1090
01:46:57.286 --> 01:47:00.539
Don't wait for me!
John, go on!

1091
01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.499
Hurry!

1092
01:47:29.985 --> 01:47:32.988
<i>-Corpus Christi.</i>
- Amen.

1093
01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:53.092
My Lady Marian.

1094
01:47:54.843 --> 01:47:57.930
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1095
01:47:58.055 --> 01:48:01.225
You misunderstand my intentions.

1096
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:04.436
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1097
01:48:05.688 --> 01:48:09.525
- Protection from whom?
- From yourself.

1098
01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:13.529
It seems that you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1099
01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:18.492
No... where do you hear such lies?

1100
01:48:19.743 --> 01:48:22.496
By your own hand, my lady.

1101
01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:29.712
I'm sorry, my child.

1102
01:48:31.005 --> 01:48:33.674
I feared you were being led astray.

1103
01:48:36.635 --> 01:48:38.137
Come.

1104
01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:48.856
It's over.

1105
01:48:49.732 --> 01:48:52.818
Today I return justice to this land.

1106
01:48:54.903 --> 01:48:57.906
I shall have to hang the ringleaders,
of course, but...

1107
01:48:58.032 --> 01:49:03.370
I would like to be generous and give you
the lives of the woodsmen and their families.

1108
01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:05.456
The children!

1109
01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:10.836
And, of course,
of your traitorous lady in waiting.

1110
01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:12.212
Get in there!

1111
01:49:14.298 --> 01:49:16.550
As a wedding gift.

1112
01:49:21.263 --> 01:49:24.933
And just who am I supposed to marry?

1113
01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:33.817
Search your heart, my child.

1114
01:49:33.942 --> 01:49:37.279
Why not a union
with the house of Nottingham

1115
01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.490
and heal the wounds in our land?

1116
01:49:39.615 --> 01:49:43.202
There is only one man who can heal
the wounds of this land.

1117
01:49:43.327 --> 01:49:45.162
Robin Hood.

1118
01:49:57.966 --> 01:49:59.885
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1119
01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:03.680
He wasted his life.
How many more lives would you waste?

1120
01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:16.735
What a beautiful child.

1121
01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:22.282
So young.

1122
01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:28.747
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1123
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:38.966
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1124
01:50:39.091 --> 01:50:42.761
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1125
01:50:49.935 --> 01:50:51.520
Marian...

1126
01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:56.233
...our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1127
01:50:57.401 --> 01:51:03.740
You understand, I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1128
01:51:06.368 --> 01:51:08.453
I have no choice.

1129
01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.832
That's true.

1130
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:53.332
Look!

1131
01:51:58.670 --> 01:52:00.172
Christian.

1132
01:52:24.863 --> 01:52:26.949
Leave him be!

1133
01:52:34.873 --> 01:52:37.292
Sorry to keep you hanging about.

1134
01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:45.968
Would you prefer pain
or death?

1135
01:52:47.386 --> 01:52:49.137
Death.

1136
01:52:49.263 --> 01:52:51.098
Torture him.

1137
01:52:52.266 --> 01:52:56.270
What about you?
Pain or death?

1138
01:52:56.395 --> 01:52:57.980
Pain.

1139
01:52:58.105 --> 01:52:59.648
Torture him.

1140
01:52:59.773 --> 01:53:01.608
You see? It makes no difference.

1141
01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:03.568
Spare me.

1142
01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:09.533
Will you keep the noise down, please?

1143
01:53:09.658 --> 01:53:14.079
Now, I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1144
01:53:16.373 --> 01:53:20.377
Either tell me where he may be hiding

1145
01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:23.964
or you'll all be hanged, and we'll catch
him anyway and do the same to him.

1146
01:53:24.089 --> 01:53:26.091
- I'd love to kill him for you.
- Will, no!

1147
01:53:30.595 --> 01:53:33.598
So he is alive, then?

1148
01:53:33.724 --> 01:53:35.726
I'm not really sure.

1149
01:53:35.851 --> 01:53:38.437
Then why would I need you?

1150
01:53:39.563 --> 01:53:43.734
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1151
01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:45.819
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1152
01:53:45.944 --> 01:53:50.032
- He knows you always hated him, traitor!
- Shut up!

1153
01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:52.451
He's a trusting fool.
He'll believe me.

1154
01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:55.912
And if he doesn't, he'll kill me
then you've lost nothing.

1155
01:53:58.248 --> 01:54:00.083
If you fail...

1156
01:54:01.585 --> 01:54:05.464
... I will personally
remove your lying tongue.

1157
01:54:08.133 --> 01:54:09.968
And if I succeed...

1158
01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:14.264
... I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1159
01:54:14.389 --> 01:54:16.725
The lash, I think.

1160
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:20.604
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1161
01:54:53.553 --> 01:54:57.057
- My pride brought us to this.
- No, <i>sadiq.</i>

1162
01:54:57.182 --> 01:54:59.976
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1163
01:55:02.687 --> 01:55:04.523
I was a fool.

1164
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:09.069
I was a fool to let him leave,

1165
01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:12.197
to believe I planned it all so perfectly.

1166
01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:17.953
I once heard a wise man say,

1167
01:55:19.204 --> 01:55:24.835
"There are no perfect men in this world,
only perfect intentions."

1168
01:55:30.799 --> 01:55:33.510
You were an honour
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1169
01:55:36.346 --> 01:55:38.974
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1170
01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.297
Will!

1171
01:56:11.089 --> 01:56:14.426
- I thought you were taken.
- I was.

1172
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:16.386
How did you escape?

1173
01:56:16.511 --> 01:56:18.013
Traitor!

1174
01:56:18.138 --> 01:56:20.557
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1175
01:56:20.682 --> 01:56:22.184
You get in there!
Get in there!

1176
01:56:22.309 --> 01:56:26.146
Nobody escapes the sheriff,
not unless he's lining his bloody pockets.

1177
01:56:26.271 --> 01:56:27.522
Where are the others?

1178
01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:31.776
- Where's my son?
- He'll have his blade in your side!

1179
01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:34.905
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1180
01:56:38.909 --> 01:56:40.660
- Bugger me!
- God!

1181
01:56:41.328 --> 01:56:43.163
Let him speak.

1182
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:47.375
I bring a message...

1183
01:56:48.877 --> 01:56:50.712
...from Nottingham.

1184
01:56:51.505 --> 01:56:54.508
Our men are to be hung
in the square at high noon tomorrow.

1185
01:56:54.633 --> 01:56:56.885
And what about my boy?

1186
01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:59.304
The boy too. Ten men in all.

1187
01:56:59.429 --> 01:57:05.602
The, er... hangings are to be part
of the celebration for the sheriff's marriage.

1188
01:57:05.727 --> 01:57:07.229
Marriage? To who?

1189
01:57:09.731 --> 01:57:11.733
Lady Marian.

1190
01:57:11.858 --> 01:57:14.236
He takes a bride of royal blood.

1191
01:57:14.361 --> 01:57:19.741
Aye, and with King Richard gone
he'll be after the bloody throne.

1192
01:57:21.201 --> 01:57:24.579
You were to use this news to get
close to me and then kill me, right, Will?

1193
01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:32.087
- What are your intentions?
- That depends on you, Locksley.

1194
01:57:33.421 --> 01:57:36.716
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1195
01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:38.927
What I wanna know is,
are you gonna finish what you started?

1196
01:57:39.052 --> 01:57:43.640
I wanna know if he's gonna turn and run
like the spoiled rich boy I always took him for.

1197
01:57:46.184 --> 01:57:50.021
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1198
01:57:50.981 --> 01:57:55.819
Where does this intolerable hatred for me
come from?

1199
01:58:05.912 --> 01:58:09.749
From knowing that our...
that our father loved you more than me.

1200
01:58:13.044 --> 01:58:14.045
Our father?

1201
01:58:15.213 --> 01:58:17.882
We are brothers, Robin of Locksley.

1202
01:58:18.008 --> 01:58:22.596
I am the son of the woman
who replaced your dead mother for a time!

1203
01:58:22.721 --> 01:58:24.973
- It was your anger drove them apart!
- It's a lie!

1204
01:58:25.098 --> 01:58:28.101
It's not a lie!
You ruined my life!

1205
01:58:40.905 --> 01:58:44.993
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1206
01:58:45.118 --> 01:58:47.454
But I found myself daring
to believe in you.

1207
01:58:49.414 --> 01:58:54.919
What I wanna know, brother, is will you
stay with us and finish what you've started?

1208
01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:02.218
I have a brother?

1209
01:59:06.181 --> 01:59:08.016
I have a brother.

1210
01:59:11.853 --> 01:59:14.356
I will make my stand with you.

1211
01:59:14.481 --> 01:59:16.650
Side by side.

1212
01:59:16.775 --> 01:59:18.109
To the end.

1213
01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.322
To the end!

1214
01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:26.868
We're all bloody in.

1215
01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:28.244
Daft buggers.

1216
01:59:33.208 --> 01:59:35.001
We finish this.

1217
02:00:02.487 --> 02:00:06.157
Overwhelmed with happiness,
thank you for asking.

1218
02:00:06.282 --> 02:00:09.452
Yes, yes, all is well.
I got all my money back,

1219
02:00:09.577 --> 02:00:14.249
Robin Hood's probably dead,
and I'm gonna be king, all as predicted.

1220
02:00:19.379 --> 02:00:20.880
Now, I want you to tell the hangman

1221
02:00:21.005 --> 02:00:24.592
I don't wanna see
any broken necks in the morning.

1222
02:00:24.718 --> 02:00:29.222
I wanna see some dancing!

1223
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:33.309
Don't touch that!

1224
02:00:34.269 --> 02:00:36.604
I can do that myself.

1225
02:00:38.314 --> 02:00:41.818
But thank you very much.

1226
02:01:24.944 --> 02:01:27.155
Have you been spying on me,
you little insect?

1227
02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:33.787
Well, who else would have made a...?

1228
02:01:52.889 --> 02:01:54.974
Where are you?

1229
02:02:00.855 --> 02:02:03.608
You come early.
The signs have not aligned yet.

1230
02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:06.444
And you can stop all that,
you old fake!

1231
02:02:07.570 --> 02:02:09.906
I will try for thee anyway.

1232
02:02:15.286 --> 02:02:18.832
The union. The blood of the lion
and the house of Nottingham

1233
02:02:18.957 --> 02:02:20.959
new power, new soul.

1234
02:02:21.584 --> 02:02:24.587
I found the hole!

1235
02:02:24.712 --> 02:02:27.715
You dare to spy on me?

1236
02:02:27.841 --> 02:02:31.761
I want the truth.

1237
02:02:31.886 --> 02:02:33.555
Why?

1238
02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:36.432
Truth has never served you before.

1239
02:02:37.058 --> 02:02:41.229
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today.

1240
02:02:41.354 --> 02:02:42.689
Mortianna did.

1241
02:02:42.814 --> 02:02:46.317
You freakish imp, I despise you.

1242
02:02:46.442 --> 02:02:48.069
After the wedding,
you're out on the streets.

1243
02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:50.780
Without my protection, the people
will rip out your black heart and burn it!

1244
02:02:50.905 --> 02:02:54.576
Without me, you're nothing.

1245
02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:59.747
You're straw. A fleabite.
A speck.

1246
02:03:02.166 --> 02:03:04.002
I birthed you from this body.

1247
02:03:05.128 --> 02:03:07.964
I stole a babe in this very castle
and killed it

1248
02:03:08.089 --> 02:03:11.676
so that you might rise in its place.

1249
02:03:13.928 --> 02:03:15.763
You're my son.

1250
02:03:19.392 --> 02:03:21.394
You despise me?

1251
02:03:22.687 --> 02:03:24.439
You are me.

1252
02:03:24.564 --> 02:03:28.401
You know, from your empty soul,
that is the truth.

1253
02:03:30.194 --> 02:03:34.449
All my life, I've been a freak.

1254
02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:39.245
But when you stud the Lady Marian,

1255
02:03:39.370 --> 02:03:43.041
my grandchild takes the throne.
My blood.

1256
02:03:43.166 --> 02:03:48.087
This twisted seed will rule through him.

1257
02:03:48.212 --> 02:03:51.507
We'll see who's freakish then.

1258
02:04:26.542 --> 02:04:29.796
- Damn!
- What was that?

1259
02:04:29.921 --> 02:04:32.090
Truly, you are a wizard.

1260
02:04:32.215 --> 02:04:34.968
The mystery is in the black powder.

1261
02:04:35.093 --> 02:04:37.428
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1262
02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:40.640
- Bull?
- Yeah.

1263
02:04:40.765 --> 02:04:43.017
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1264
02:04:43.142 --> 02:04:46.729
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1265
02:04:46.854 --> 02:04:49.524
I will conceal myself here,
below the scaffold,

1266
02:04:49.649 --> 02:04:52.902
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1267
02:04:53.027 --> 02:04:55.446
No, I'll do that.
You have to cover us with your bow.

1268
02:04:55.571 --> 02:04:57.407
It's too dangerous, Will.

1269
02:04:57.532 --> 02:04:58.950
So is your aim.

1270
02:05:01.828 --> 02:05:04.914
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1271
02:05:05.039 --> 02:05:08.376
Now, our success depends
on total concert.

1272
02:05:08.501 --> 02:05:11.337
- We may be only six men...
- Seven.

1273
02:05:11.462 --> 02:05:13.297
What are you doing?
Where's the little ones?

1274
02:05:13.423 --> 02:05:15.425
They're safe,
they're with me mother.

1275
02:05:15.550 --> 02:05:17.719
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1276
02:05:17.844 --> 02:05:21.180
I've given birth to eight babies.
Don't talk to me about getting hurt.

1277
02:05:21.305 --> 02:05:24.392
Anyway, I'm not just gonna sit here
and let one of them die, am I?

1278
02:05:24.517 --> 02:05:27.687
You should be bloody well
minding the other seven.

1279
02:05:27.812 --> 02:05:29.647
Tell her, Rob.

1280
02:05:33.901 --> 02:05:38.156
Fanny... you will take position here.

1281
02:05:51.419 --> 02:05:55.339
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1282
02:05:55.465 --> 02:06:00.094
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1283
02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:01.304
No blades, no bows.

1284
02:06:01.429 --> 02:06:04.432
No blades.

1285
02:06:04.557 --> 02:06:06.225
What have you got there, Father?

1286
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:10.772
The Lord's finest brew
for the good sheriff's fighting men.

1287
02:06:10.897 --> 02:06:12.899
It has a mighty kick.

1288
02:06:17.070 --> 02:06:19.155
No blades, no bows.

1289
02:06:29.832 --> 02:06:33.669
- Hey, don't anger him.
- He is a Celt.

1290
02:06:37.632 --> 02:06:41.385
Psst. John. John!

1291
02:07:14.085 --> 02:07:15.920
Hey, you.

1292
02:07:16.796 --> 02:07:20.049
- Do I know you?
- Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1293
02:07:20.174 --> 02:07:22.009
Oh, my God, you stink.

1294
02:07:22.135 --> 02:07:24.470
Pardon me, sir. Pardon my blindness.
I'm always falling...

1295
02:07:24.595 --> 02:07:26.430
Get out of here!

1296
02:07:27.390 --> 02:07:29.100
Thank you, sir.

1297
02:07:29.225 --> 02:07:31.227
Careful, Friar.

1298
02:07:33.729 --> 02:07:35.481
What are you doing?

1299
02:07:35.606 --> 02:07:40.027
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the sheriff's nuptials.

1300
02:07:40.153 --> 02:07:43.739
- Why, is there something amiss?
- Yeah, you are. Get this stuff out of here!

1301
02:07:43.865 --> 02:07:48.035
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
We shall collect our offerings and depart.

1302
02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:49.579
Is this your finger?

1303
02:07:49.704 --> 02:07:52.540
Leper, what?
Go on, get this cart out of here!

1304
02:07:52.665 --> 02:07:56.252
Leaving bits and pieces of himself
all over England.

1305
02:08:04.802 --> 02:08:06.637
What are you doing here?

1306
02:08:06.762 --> 02:08:09.515
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging, I do.

1307
02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:12.643
- What's in this bundle?
- That's firewood.

1308
02:08:12.768 --> 02:08:14.478
Hey!

1309
02:08:17.690 --> 02:08:18.691
Hello, my lover.

1310
02:08:26.115 --> 02:08:29.118
Make way for the Lord's work!
No fighting here.

1311
02:08:29.243 --> 02:08:31.245
Make way for the Lord's work!

1312
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:34.415
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1313
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.710
God, receive them in thy mercy

1314
02:08:37.835 --> 02:08:43.341
and show them the love
that they do so richly deserve.

1315
02:08:43.466 --> 02:08:48.054
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1316
02:09:06.948 --> 02:09:10.034
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1317
02:09:11.202 --> 02:09:14.038
No more than your wedding present.

1318
02:09:17.625 --> 02:09:20.211
Bring them out!

1319
02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:33.808
Get your hands off me, you dog.

1320
02:09:53.911 --> 02:09:58.791
...and suffer knowing the lord
and his ministers are watching over you.

1321
02:10:40.750 --> 02:10:42.752
Make way!

1322
02:10:54.805 --> 02:10:56.724
- Traitor! Traitor!
- No!

1323
02:11:06.233 --> 02:11:08.944
What's going on?

1324
02:11:10.321 --> 02:11:12.156
Bring him here!

1325
02:11:13.032 --> 02:11:15.701
- I'll kill you!
- What do I do?

1326
02:11:24.210 --> 02:11:26.879
Oh, the turncoat.

1327
02:11:27.004 --> 02:11:28.714
Did you succeed?

1328
02:11:28.839 --> 02:11:34.845
Well, I, er... I found his lair
but he was already dead.

1329
02:11:36.013 --> 02:11:40.267
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1330
02:11:40.393 --> 02:11:44.647
No. I saw a grave.

1331
02:11:44.772 --> 02:11:46.065
We found this on him.

1332
02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:53.906
String him up with the others.

1333
02:11:57.451 --> 02:11:58.953
Put me down! Let go!

1334
02:12:03.499 --> 02:12:04.500
Let me go!

1335
02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:12.341
- Leave him! He's only a boy.
- Shut up!

1336
02:12:13.509 --> 02:12:16.512
Bastard!
You all right?

1337
02:12:17.638 --> 02:12:19.682
Now, Robin?

1338
02:12:34.613 --> 02:12:37.616
My lord, it appears there's no more room!

1339
02:12:37.741 --> 02:12:41.787
- I'm afraid I'll have to respectfully decline!
- Come on, you. Down!

1340
02:12:42.872 --> 02:12:43.998
Down.

1341
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:48.961
Come on, move it. Hold your tongue!

1342
02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:54.925
There's always room for one more.

1343
02:13:28.292 --> 02:13:30.085
- No!
- That's my boy!

1344
02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:33.255
I'm coming, Wulf!

1345
02:13:39.011 --> 02:13:40.429
Hey!

1346
02:13:40.554 --> 02:13:41.764
My boy!

1347
02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:08.958
- Locksley.
- Robin!

1348
02:14:28.686 --> 02:14:30.020
Wulf!

1349
02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:44.827
Get some troops in here!

1350
02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.963
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

1351
02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:09.768
Help!

1352
02:15:45.554 --> 02:15:46.930
- Wulf!
- Father!

1353
02:15:48.766 --> 02:15:50.017
Oh, thank God.

1354
02:15:52.186 --> 02:15:55.022
Come on, you milksops!

1355
02:15:55.147 --> 02:15:57.816
- Fight your way free.
- Look out!

1356
02:16:04.406 --> 02:16:05.949
This way! To the wall!

1357
02:16:06.075 --> 02:16:11.914
My lord sheriff,
is this your idea of control?

1358
02:16:12.039 --> 02:16:14.124
Shut up, you twit.

1359
02:16:14.249 --> 02:16:16.877
- Come with me.
- Robin!

1360
02:16:19.338 --> 02:16:20.881
Marian.

1361
02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:23.050
Marian!

1362
02:16:23.842 --> 02:16:25.594
English!

1363
02:16:25.719 --> 02:16:27.346
English!

1364
02:16:27.471 --> 02:16:32.059
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir AI Bakir!

1365
02:16:32.184 --> 02:16:36.313
I am not one of you
but I fight!

1366
02:16:36.438 --> 02:16:38.982
I fight with Robin Hood!

1367
02:16:39.108 --> 02:16:42.695
I fight against a tyrant
who holds you under his boot!

1368
02:16:43.278 --> 02:16:48.951
If you would be free men
then you must fight! Join us now!

1369
02:16:51.161 --> 02:16:53.372
- Join Robin Hood!
- Freedom!

1370
02:16:54.957 --> 02:16:56.208
Come on!

1371
02:17:18.355 --> 02:17:21.900
- Marian!
- No! Robin!

1372
02:17:28.198 --> 02:17:30.117
John!

1373
02:17:31.535 --> 02:17:33.954
- Close the gate!
- No!

1374
02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:36.498
Guard it with your life!

1375
02:17:36.623 --> 02:17:39.168
Bring the bishop to my chapel!

1376
02:17:40.836 --> 02:17:42.755
Right there.

1377
02:17:43.797 --> 02:17:46.550
That's good, John. That's good.

1378
02:17:50.137 --> 02:17:52.139
Is she worth it?

1379
02:17:52.264 --> 02:17:54.266
Worth dying for?

1380
02:17:59.646 --> 02:18:00.898
Will!

1381
02:18:09.656 --> 02:18:11.825
Fuck me, he cleared it!

1382
02:18:16.497 --> 02:18:17.498
Marian!

1383
02:18:41.438 --> 02:18:42.439
Ah!

1384
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:46.318
We're doomed.

1385
02:18:52.199 --> 02:18:54.535
It is rebellion, my lord.
We must escape.

1386
02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:56.578
Marry us!

1387
02:18:56.703 --> 02:18:59.164
I will never marry you!

1388
02:19:01.625 --> 02:19:05.462
That's my wife, crone!

1389
02:19:05.587 --> 02:19:07.339
Get away!

1390
02:19:07.464 --> 02:19:10.467
She's ripe.
She will give us a son.

1391
02:19:10.592 --> 02:19:12.344
You must take her now.

1392
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:17.891
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1393
02:19:18.016 --> 02:19:21.603
For once in my life,
I will have something pure!

1394
02:19:21.728 --> 02:19:25.774
- Will you stop interfering?
- It is madness to delay.

1395
02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:30.362
Marry them or face me!

1396
02:19:40.831 --> 02:19:42.249
Marian!

1397
02:19:47.462 --> 02:19:48.881
Marian!

1398
02:19:51.717 --> 02:19:53.552
Where is she?

1399
02:19:57.806 --> 02:20:01.310
- The Lady Marian?
- Up the stairs, that way!

1400
02:20:04.563 --> 02:20:05.981
Marian?

1401
02:20:07.691 --> 02:20:08.859
Marian!

1402
02:20:09.943 --> 02:20:12.696
- Robin!
- Get on with it!

1403
02:20:12.821 --> 02:20:14.323
Robin!

1404
02:20:17.868 --> 02:20:19.870
The statue.

1405
02:20:21.288 --> 02:20:24.958
Do you, George,
Sheriff of Nottingham,

1406
02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:26.668
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1407
02:20:35.594 --> 02:20:37.846
To have and to hold,

1408
02:20:37.971 --> 02:20:41.558
in sickness and in health, for better
or for worse, for richer, for poorer...

1409
02:20:41.683 --> 02:20:44.770
- Yes, yes! Come on!
- Make haste!

1410
02:20:44.895 --> 02:20:47.397
And do you, Marian,
of the House of Dubois,

1411
02:20:47.522 --> 02:20:49.274
take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1412
02:20:49.399 --> 02:20:51.568
- No...
- Yes, of course she does.

1413
02:20:58.116 --> 02:21:00.911
- Marian!
- Damned English oak!

1414
02:21:01.036 --> 02:21:02.204
- Robin!
- Marian!

1415
02:21:02.329 --> 02:21:05.332
- Robin!
- I'll try another way.

1416
02:21:12.339 --> 02:21:16.259
No! No!

1417
02:21:16.385 --> 02:21:18.887
What do you want?

1418
02:21:23.517 --> 02:21:27.104
I can't do this with all that racket!

1419
02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:33.193
How could you?
How could you?

1420
02:21:49.292 --> 02:21:51.962
- The painted man!
- The witch!

1421
02:21:52.087 --> 02:21:56.174
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1422
02:21:56.299 --> 02:21:58.135
Don't harm an old woman.

1423
02:22:17.237 --> 02:22:20.907
You may take this body,
but it will not be me!

1424
02:22:21.033 --> 02:22:22.200
It will not be me!

1425
02:22:23.285 --> 02:22:25.412
Not again!

1426
02:22:26.538 --> 02:22:29.791
I now pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father,

1427
02:22:29.916 --> 02:22:33.420
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1428
02:22:41.553 --> 02:22:43.055
Robin.

1429
02:22:47.059 --> 02:22:48.935
Do you mind, Locksley?

1430
02:22:50.062 --> 02:22:51.730
We've just been married.

1431
02:23:04.659 --> 02:23:06.411
Recognise this?

1432
02:23:08.538 --> 02:23:11.041
It belonged to your father.

1433
02:23:12.167 --> 02:23:16.004
Appropriate, don't you think,
that I now use it to send you to meet him?

1434
02:23:18.423 --> 02:23:21.176
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1435
02:23:22.135 --> 02:23:23.637
Really?

1436
02:23:26.515 --> 02:23:28.517
Now we're even.

1437
02:23:41.113 --> 02:23:42.114
Robin!

1438
02:23:58.171 --> 02:24:00.757
If I must, I will take you
a piece at a time.

1439
02:24:05.137 --> 02:24:06.888
I'll do the only taking today.

1440
02:24:11.935 --> 02:24:13.270
No!

1441
02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:18.733
Gold.

1442
02:24:18.859 --> 02:24:22.070
You sold your soul to Satan, Your Grace.

1443
02:24:23.738 --> 02:24:27.325
You accused innocent men
of witchcraft and let them die.

1444
02:24:28.827 --> 02:24:34.583
Brother friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1445
02:24:34.708 --> 02:24:36.877
No. No, I wouldn't.

1446
02:24:37.836 --> 02:24:41.173
In fact, I'll help you pack
for your journey, yeah.

1447
02:24:41.298 --> 02:24:44.384
You're going to need lots of gold
to help you on your way.

1448
02:24:44.509 --> 02:24:47.179
You're a very rich man.
This too.

1449
02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.265
Enough!

1450
02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:52.559
Here's 30 pieces of silver...

1451
02:24:52.684 --> 02:24:56.021
...to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1452
02:25:33.850 --> 02:25:35.310
Robin!

1453
02:25:49.741 --> 02:25:52.118
Robin!

1454
02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:02.712
Robin...

1455
02:26:04.381 --> 02:26:06.383
Get ready.

1456
02:26:06.841 --> 02:26:08.176
No!

1457
02:27:37.057 --> 02:27:39.142
I have fulfilled my vow, <i>sadiq.</i>

1458
02:27:57.327 --> 02:27:59.162
You came for me.

1459
02:28:00.622 --> 02:28:02.707
You're alive.

1460
02:28:02.832 --> 02:28:04.918
I would die for you.

1461
02:28:13.385 --> 02:28:17.055
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church

1462
02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:20.308
I say any man who has reason
why these two should not be joined...

1463
02:28:22.143 --> 02:28:26.481
...let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1464
02:28:30.443 --> 02:28:33.863
- Then I now pronounce you...
- Hold! I speak.

1465
02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:48.002
- Richard!
- It's the king.

1466
02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:59.222
- I will not allow this wedding to proceed.
- My lord...

1467
02:28:59.347 --> 02:29:01.099
Unless...

1468
02:29:02.058 --> 02:29:04.269
... I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1469
02:29:04.394 --> 02:29:05.812
You look radiant, cousin.

1470
02:29:05.937 --> 02:29:08.523
Oh, Richard.

1471
02:29:09.691 --> 02:29:12.026
We are deeply honoured, Your Majesty.

1472
02:29:12.152 --> 02:29:15.405
It is I who am honoured, Lord Locksley.

1473
02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:18.450
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1474
02:29:18.575 --> 02:29:19.742
Friar, proceed.

1475
02:29:23.997 --> 02:29:25.498
My liege.

1476
02:29:28.126 --> 02:29:30.044
Husband and wife.

1477
02:29:32.046 --> 02:29:35.216
- You may kiss the bride.
- I know that.

1478
02:30:01.201 --> 02:30:03.036
Now, get out of it.

1479
02:30:03.161 --> 02:30:05.914
