1
00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:55.175
Show them the courage of Allah!

2
00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:26.915
He says you stole the bread.
It's a lie.

3
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:30.127
I caught him stealing ours.

4
00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:32.462
Cut off the infidel's hand.

5
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.590
No, I took the bread!

6
00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:37.342
That's not true.
They're not interested in the truth.

7
00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:40.888
But he's lying!
You're too weak, Peter. You won't live.

8
00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.097
As you wish.

9
00:03:42.682 --> 00:03:45.934
Cut the other's hand off as well.
I'm sorry.

10
00:03:46.102 --> 00:03:48.186
I'm sorry, Robin.

11
00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.358
Oh, God!

12
00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.160
No! No! No!

13
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:23.305
This is English courage.

14
00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:41.865
That's for five years of hell!

15
00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:50.791
Behind you!

16
00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:01.843
Come on, Robin, for God's sake!
Come on!

17
00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:05.639
Wait! Take us with you!

18
00:05:11.187 --> 00:05:13.230
You cannot save those people, Christian!

19
00:05:13.856 --> 00:05:16.817
But you can save me!
They're coming, Robin.

20
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.529
Christian!

21
00:05:20.947 --> 00:05:22.906
Why should I?
For pity's sake.

22
00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:26.034
Mine is a sentence of death.
He's a Moor! Don't listen!

23
00:05:26.202 --> 00:05:28.412
Set me free! I will show you a way out.

24
00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:31.999
Why should we?
If you do not, we are all dead men.

25
00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:35.043
No, Robin, for God's sake!
Robin, they're coming!

26
00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:45.429
I'm sorry.
Hurry! Come, Christian! Come!

27
00:05:52.854 --> 00:05:54.438
This way!

28
00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:04.281
Thanks. I misjudged you.

29
00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:05.782
You are fast with a sword.

30
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.578
Five years I have waited to smell
free air. That makes a man fast.

31
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:13.457
Peter!

32
00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:19.129
It's mortal.

33
00:06:19.297 --> 00:06:20.797
Leave me.

34
00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:25.302
Give this ring to my sister, Marian.

35
00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:27.721
Now swear you'll protect her for me.

36
00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.849
His wound is by the heart.
We cannot save him.

37
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.143
Swear it, Robin!

38
00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:35.854
I swear it.
They're coming!

39
00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:38.815
Tell Marian I died a free Englishman.

40
00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:42.903
Peter! Peter. Peter!

41
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.905
For England!

42
00:06:49.202 --> 00:06:52.829
Come, my friend.
Make his sacrifice an act of honor.

43
00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:54.664
Come now!

44
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.403
Why did you cut me free, Christian?

45
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.575
Whatever blood is in your veins,
no man deserves to die in there.

46
00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:38.708
Farewell, friend.

47
00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:40.836
God speed your way.

48
00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.505
Our way lies together
with the speed of Allah.

49
00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:44.756
What?

50
00:07:44.924 --> 00:07:46.591
You have saved my life, Christian.

51
00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:50.428
I will stay with you until I have
saved yours. That is my vow.

52
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.391
Thanks, but I go to England.
I relieve you of your obligation.

53
00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:56.643
Only Allah can do that.

54
00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.063
What if I say no?

55
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:01.648
You have no choice.

56
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:05.235
I am Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir.

57
00:08:05.403 --> 00:08:07.529
You may call me Azeem.

58
00:08:10.575 --> 00:08:12.534
Robin of Locksley.

59
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.175
Kindest sir:

60
00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.261
It is rumored you fought
in King Richard's Crusade...

61
00:08:31.429 --> 00:08:33.930
with my beloved son, Robin.

62
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:37.851
I fear you have returned home
to desperate times...

63
00:08:38.102 --> 00:08:41.771
when dark forces
plot against our absent king.

64
00:08:42.023 --> 00:08:44.858
I am anxious for word of my son.

65
00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:48.278
Were you present at his capture
near Jerusalem?

66
00:08:48.613 --> 00:08:51.865
Do you know the name of the potentate
who holds him?

67
00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:55.118
Does he still bear me ill will?

68
00:08:55.286 --> 00:08:57.621
A little news, please, sir.

69
00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:01.958
I would give all that I own
for his release.

70
00:09:16.349 --> 00:09:18.725
Stop there!
Help me, my lord!

71
00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:21.394
You should have waited!

72
00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:26.566
I'm sorry you were disturbed, master.
Duncan, it's all right. Let him go.

73
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:32.113
They've taken my Gwen.
My daughter!

74
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:35.408
Who's taken her?
Men! On horses.

75
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:37.619
In masks.

76
00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:39.829
We tried to stop them, but...

77
00:09:39.997 --> 00:09:42.791
My son is dead.

78
00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:44.668
He's dead.

79
00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:57.138
Master, stay.
There is an evil moon tonight.

80
00:09:57.348 --> 00:10:00.016
Never fear, Duncan.
Good will overcome.

81
00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:02.310
Trust in that.

82
00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:19.536
I'm sorry, my lord.
I had no choice.

83
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:29.379
You!

84
00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:31.840
Locksley.

85
00:10:32.216 --> 00:10:34.134
The king shall hear of this!

86
00:10:34.302 --> 00:10:36.052
Join us.

87
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.846
Never.

88
00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.598
Join us...

89
00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:42.684
or die.

90
00:10:45.396 --> 00:10:48.815
God and King Richard!

91
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:42.952
Thank you, Lord.

92
00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:51.878
I'm home!

93
00:11:54.423 --> 00:11:56.132
You are strange, Christian.

94
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.635
Yes. But I'm free!

95
00:11:58.803 --> 00:12:03.139
Now I beg you to free yourself of your vow.
Return with the boat.

96
00:12:03.307 --> 00:12:06.976
I know how it feels to be so far
from your home and family.

97
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.815
Because I love them so much,
I cannot dishonor them.

98
00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:16.736
I thought you'd say that.

99
00:12:34.171 --> 00:12:36.756
No man controls my destiny.

100
00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:40.552
Especially not one who attacks
downwind and stinks of garlic.

101
00:12:46.183 --> 00:12:47.934
Come, Azeem!

102
00:12:50.396 --> 00:12:52.230
Our fighting days are done.

103
00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:56.568
By nightfall,
we'll celebrate with my father.

104
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:02.699
You understand, of course...

105
00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:04.409
I had to try.

106
00:13:04.577 --> 00:13:06.661
I would have succeeded.

107
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.170
Why must you walk in back of me?

108
00:13:15.337 --> 00:13:18.047
In your country, am I not the infidel?

109
00:13:19.884 --> 00:13:23.845
It seems safer to appear as your slave
rather than your equal.

110
00:13:24.013 --> 00:13:26.806
For an infidel you have
uncommon clarity of thinking.

111
00:13:26.974 --> 00:13:30.185
Yet you tell me of nothing of yourself.
For instance, your name.

112
00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.896
Azeem. What does it mean?
It means "great one."

113
00:13:33.063 --> 00:13:36.608
Great one, really?
Did you give yourself this name?

114
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:41.154
It's a joke.

115
00:13:43.741 --> 00:13:47.744
Azeem the great one, I am home!

116
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.665
Look!

117
00:13:54.293 --> 00:13:56.002
Mistletoe.

118
00:13:58.047 --> 00:14:01.716
Many a maid's lost her resolve to me
thanks to this little plant.

119
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.846
In my country, we talk to our women.

120
00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.599
We do not drug them with plants.

121
00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:12.060
What do you know of women?

122
00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.981
Where I come from, Christian...

123
00:14:17.149 --> 00:14:21.486
there are women of such beauty
they can possess a man's mind so...

124
00:14:21.654 --> 00:14:24.113
that he would be willing
to die for them.

125
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.202
Wait. Is that why
you were to be executed?

126
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.663
Because of a woman?

127
00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:36.960
That's it, isn't it?

128
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:38.795
That's it!

129
00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:44.384
It is close to sunset.

130
00:14:44.552 --> 00:14:47.136
You painted old dog.
Who was she?

131
00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:49.347
The mullah's daughter?

132
00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:54.686
Another man's wife?

133
00:14:56.146 --> 00:14:57.480
What's her name?

134
00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:02.360
Is there no sun in this cursed country?!

135
00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:04.821
Which way is east?

136
00:15:04.989 --> 00:15:07.323
Her name?
East!

137
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.325
Her name.

138
00:15:13.747 --> 00:15:15.456
Jasmina.

139
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.500
That way.

140
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.169
You are sure?
I'd know blindfolded.

141
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.505
I'm five miles from home.

142
00:15:28.012 --> 00:15:30.096
Was she worth it?

143
00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:33.558
Worth dying for.

144
00:15:51.285 --> 00:15:53.328
Come on, boy, run!

145
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.375
You're dog's meat, son!

146
00:16:26.195 --> 00:16:28.738
You're dog's meat, son,
do you know that?

147
00:16:29.657 --> 00:16:33.785
Get down here! You know what
you've done. Come down here!

148
00:16:33.952 --> 00:16:37.538
Down!
You're not playing by the rules, boy.

149
00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:40.208
Deer don't climb trees.

150
00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.794
Perhaps he thinks he's a game bird.

151
00:16:42.961 --> 00:16:45.630
Shall we teach him to fly?

152
00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:48.925
Get him down.

153
00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.469
Hold.

154
00:16:53.222 --> 00:16:57.266
I'm curious as to what manner of creature is
so fearsome it takes six men to attack it?

155
00:16:57.893 --> 00:17:00.478
Stand down. This is no affair of yours.

156
00:17:00.646 --> 00:17:03.648
Well, have we treed the devil himself?
Let me see.

157
00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:08.152
A small boy, a truly dangerous animal.

158
00:17:08.404 --> 00:17:11.948
This boy killed one
of the Sheriff of Nottingham's deer.

159
00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:14.659
You starve us! We needed the meat.

160
00:17:14.827 --> 00:17:18.287
I advise you to move on, pilgrim.
This is the sheriff's land.

161
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:19.997
Wrong.

162
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:24.836
This is my land and my tree. Therefore
whatever's in it also belongs to me.

163
00:17:26.922 --> 00:17:31.676
Might I have the pleasure of your name
before I have you run through?

164
00:17:32.761 --> 00:17:34.804
Robin of Locksley.

165
00:17:38.517 --> 00:17:42.019
Well, well...
Locksley.

166
00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:45.273
Welcome home.

167
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.152
Kill him!
To arms, swords!

168
00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.237
Come on, hurry up!
He's armed!

169
00:17:52.906 --> 00:17:55.491
Azeem! It's time to redeem that vow!

170
00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.870
Unleash the hounds!

171
00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:02.081
Get off your damn knees!

172
00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:07.670
Look out!

173
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:15.887
Yeah!

174
00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:22.518
Now, sir...

175
00:18:22.686 --> 00:18:26.731
if you'd be so kind as to give me
your name before I run you through.

176
00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:30.735
Guy of Gisborne, the sheriff's cousin.

177
00:18:33.197 --> 00:18:36.157
That little bastard was poaching deer.
Poach?

178
00:18:36.325 --> 00:18:39.035
Is it not a greater crime
to starve a family?

179
00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.371
Go on, Locksley.

180
00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:44.499
Go on.

181
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:49.462
I've seen enough blood spilt
to last two lifetimes.

182
00:18:50.422 --> 00:18:52.381
Now get off my land.

183
00:18:59.056 --> 00:19:03.351
Tell Nottingham what happens to his scum
when they pick on small children.

184
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.397
You.

185
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:12.527
You travel 10,000 miles to save my life,
then leave me to be butchered?!

186
00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.238
I fulfill my vows when I choose.

187
00:19:15.489 --> 00:19:18.407
Which does not include prayer times
or meal times...

188
00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.827
or any time I'm outnumbered 6 to 1.

189
00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.371
You whine like a mule.

190
00:19:24.248 --> 00:19:26.415
You are still alive.

191
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.716
Have no fear. Come down, boy.

192
00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:42.849
Is it true, boy? Did you kill a deer?

193
00:19:44.142 --> 00:19:46.435
Hundreds of them.

194
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.900
You scared him.

195
00:19:58.615 --> 00:20:00.950
Interesting place, this...

196
00:20:01.118 --> 00:20:02.702
England.

197
00:20:22.806 --> 00:20:26.225
Hold up, Sir Guy.
The sheriff's not to be disturbed.

198
00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.152
Cousin.

199
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.656
I trust you justify your intrusion
with news of profound value.

200
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:46.579
I met a hooded man today who bade me
warn you not to harm his people.

201
00:20:46.747 --> 00:20:49.123
Who told you to cover up?

202
00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:51.500
His name?

203
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:53.753
Robin of Locksley.

204
00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.213
The prodigal son returns.

205
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:59.383
He's a whelp!
This girl could best him.

206
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.677
Put it there!

207
00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:09.101
Yes, well, this whelp
bested four of my men.

208
00:21:09.269 --> 00:21:12.772
Yes, well, your men were probably drunk.

209
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:18.069
Yet you survived, cousin.
I barely survived.

210
00:21:24.201 --> 00:21:26.202
Markings of Islam.

211
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.872
I'm sure it will take an army
to match these rogues.

212
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.628
I trust Locksley visited his manor
and found the home fires still burning.

213
00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.590
Time for portents, cousin.

214
00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:52.853
Mortianna?

215
00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:11.789
Shut up.

216
00:22:21.925 --> 00:22:23.634
You called, madam?

217
00:22:55.459 --> 00:22:57.126
What do you see?

218
00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.257
The son of a dead man.
Locksley.

219
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.304
Does he affect us?
He precedes the Lionheart.

220
00:23:08.472 --> 00:23:11.766
King Richard returns from the Crusades.
That could prove awkward...

221
00:23:11.933 --> 00:23:14.518
and will soften the spines
of the barons. Soon?

222
00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:16.479
Make haste.

223
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.190
But my plan is still intact?

224
00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.278
What is wrong?

225
00:23:24.446 --> 00:23:27.948
I have seen our death.

226
00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:31.452
The painted man,
he haunts my dreams.

227
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.539
Adorned with strange,
foreign markings.

228
00:23:35.707 --> 00:23:38.084
Locksley's companion!

229
00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:42.713
Kill him. Kill them both.

230
00:23:50.388 --> 00:23:51.931
Father?

231
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:56.769
Father! Anyone here?

232
00:23:57.687 --> 00:23:58.813
Duncan!

233
00:23:59.731 --> 00:24:01.357
Father!

234
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.619
No.

235
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.083
No!

236
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:22.503
Who is it?
It's my father.

237
00:24:28.385 --> 00:24:33.556
Who's there?

238
00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:35.516
Master Robin?

239
00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:38.561
Is that you?

240
00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:40.146
Duncan?

241
00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:43.899
Praise be! I thought God
had abandoned us.

242
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:45.401
Duncan, my father...

243
00:24:45.569 --> 00:24:47.695
It's a miracle!
Why...?

244
00:24:47.863 --> 00:24:50.781
Why didn't you cut him down?
It's a miracle, I never thought...

245
00:24:50.949 --> 00:24:54.034
Damn you, Duncan, are you deaf?!
Easy!

246
00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:55.870
Look at him.

247
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.166
I would have done if I could see.

248
00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:06.297
Who did this to you, Duncan?

249
00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:09.592
Guy. Guy of Gisborne.

250
00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:12.720
With the sheriff and his witch
looking on.

251
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.432
Why? They say the sheriff
captured your father...

252
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.309
worshiping the devil.

253
00:25:18.602 --> 00:25:21.812
That he signed a confession
before the bishop.

254
00:25:22.856 --> 00:25:25.983
No, that's not possible.

255
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:30.154
Nottingham declared
all Locksley lands forfeit.

256
00:25:30.697 --> 00:25:33.115
Did you believe the charges?

257
00:25:34.117 --> 00:25:37.369
Not even when they took my eyes.

258
00:25:48.882 --> 00:25:50.549
We must go.

259
00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:57.348
He loved you to the end, young master.

260
00:25:57.515 --> 00:26:00.309
He never gave up hope of your return.

261
00:26:00.477 --> 00:26:02.645
I should have been here.

262
00:26:05.023 --> 00:26:08.067
He called the Crusades a foolish quest.

263
00:26:08.944 --> 00:26:12.655
He said it was vanity to force
other men to our religion.

264
00:26:13.406 --> 00:26:15.282
But you must flee now.

265
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.744
Head south to safety.
Gisborne will surely seek revenge.

266
00:26:18.912 --> 00:26:21.080
I hear you, Duncan.

267
00:26:22.916 --> 00:26:24.667
You should go home.

268
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.379
My world is turned upside down here.

269
00:26:29.464 --> 00:26:31.423
I cannot ask you to come
where I am going.

270
00:26:31.967 --> 00:26:35.135
Alone, Christian,
you will only get yourself killed.

271
00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:38.180
Besides...

272
00:26:38.682 --> 00:26:42.142
there is nothing left
for me to go home to.

273
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:50.234
I will not rest
until my father's avenged!

274
00:26:53.947 --> 00:26:56.198
I swear it...

275
00:26:56.366 --> 00:26:58.409
by my own blood.

276
00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:11.714
What is this place?

277
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.549
Peter's home.

278
00:27:13.717 --> 00:27:17.136
It's nearly six years
since we left together.

279
00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:20.139
We'll find food and shelter here.

280
00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:25.728
No more beggars!

281
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.073
Tell the mistress of the house
Robin of Locksley's at her door.

282
00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:40.617
Her ladyship's not here.

283
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.954
Is the child Marian at home?

284
00:27:44.122 --> 00:27:46.623
Maybe she is, maybe she isn't.

285
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.465
The hospitality in this country
is as warm as the weather.

286
00:27:56.092 --> 00:27:57.926
It's a joke.
Really?

287
00:27:58.094 --> 00:28:00.179
Leave your weapons.

288
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:04.975
Just you.

289
00:28:19.657 --> 00:28:21.700
Wait here.

290
00:28:22.577 --> 00:28:24.411
Right here?

291
00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:33.295
A curse on Moors and Saracens!

292
00:28:33.463 --> 00:28:38.592
Were it not for their ungodly ways,
Master Robin would never have left.

293
00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:44.556
What manner of name is Azeem?

294
00:28:44.724 --> 00:28:47.393
Irish? Cornish?

295
00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:50.020
Moorish.

296
00:28:54.109 --> 00:28:55.943
Who are you?

297
00:28:57.862 --> 00:28:59.655
Robin of Locksley.

298
00:28:59.823 --> 00:29:01.365
You lie. Robin is dead.

299
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:04.201
Step into the light.

300
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:11.125
Turn around.

301
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.423
Am I to dance next?

302
00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:23.095
Who are you?
I am the Maid Marian.

303
00:29:23.263 --> 00:29:27.182
Well, then show yourself, child,
for we knew each other well.

304
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:39.945
The years have...

305
00:29:40.113 --> 00:29:42.614
been kind.
Thank you.

306
00:29:42.782 --> 00:29:46.410
With the king away,
we must guard against villainous outlaws...

307
00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:50.747
who would kidnap a relative of his.
You can see I am not one of those.

308
00:29:51.166 --> 00:29:52.875
Perhaps.

309
00:29:53.668 --> 00:29:56.253
Now remove yourself from this house.

310
00:29:57.589 --> 00:30:01.425
I would, my lady,
but I'm sworn to protect you.

311
00:30:01.593 --> 00:30:03.302
Protect me?

312
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.055
Robin of Locksley was nothing
but a spoiled bully.

313
00:30:09.184 --> 00:30:13.270
And besides, as you can see,
we have enough protection.

314
00:30:13.438 --> 00:30:15.397
Marian, wait!

315
00:30:17.734 --> 00:30:21.028
You are truly courageous
against an unarmed man.

316
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:35.083
Point me toward danger, Azeem!
I'm ready!

317
00:31:11.162 --> 00:31:13.580
Hello, Marian.

318
00:31:21.089 --> 00:31:23.715
His last thoughts were of you.

319
00:31:28.304 --> 00:31:30.472
Oh, Peter.

320
00:31:33.643 --> 00:31:35.769
I'm sorry, Marian.

321
00:31:36.646 --> 00:31:38.355
I'm sorry.

322
00:31:40.191 --> 00:31:44.194
How do I know you didn't abandon him
to save your own skin?

323
00:31:44.821 --> 00:31:47.322
No one feels his loss more than I.

324
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.951
Next time I'm in London,
I'll give my mother your condolences.

325
00:31:53.079 --> 00:31:57.165
I would think for your safety
that you would join her there.

326
00:31:57.333 --> 00:31:59.876
I have no interest in life at court.

327
00:32:00.044 --> 00:32:03.297
All that gossipmongering
and currying favor.

328
00:32:04.382 --> 00:32:06.633
But you're alone here.

329
00:32:07.343 --> 00:32:11.680
Hardly.
These years have left us many in need.

330
00:32:13.016 --> 00:32:16.810
While you and my brother played heroes,
Nottingham plundered the shire.

331
00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:19.521
I see you still have your lands.

332
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:24.818
Because I give him
no excuse to take them.

333
00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:30.365
I am the king's cousin. It is my station to
look after these people until his return.

334
00:32:33.703 --> 00:32:35.370
Marian.

335
00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:40.459
Marian. Marian.

336
00:32:41.753 --> 00:32:45.714
My purpose in coming here
was not to hurt you.

337
00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:50.218
I swore... I swore to your brother
that I would protect you.

338
00:32:50.386 --> 00:32:53.889
You cannot replace my brother.

339
00:32:55.642 --> 00:32:57.351
I don't want to replace him.

340
00:32:57.518 --> 00:33:02.064
I've returned to find my home destroyed
and my father murdered.

341
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:06.234
The only explanations for it
are the ramblings of an old blind man.

342
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:11.239
All I remember of you
is a spoiled bully...

343
00:33:11.407 --> 00:33:14.785
who used to burn my hair as a child.

344
00:33:15.912 --> 00:33:19.998
Please allow that years of war and prison
may change a man.

345
00:33:24.337 --> 00:33:28.715
Robin, whatever happened between you
and your father, you mustn't believe...

346
00:33:28.883 --> 00:33:31.176
what they accused him of.

347
00:33:31.344 --> 00:33:33.095
I don't.

348
00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:35.347
Christian!

349
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.607
Look.

350
00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:47.401
Look!

351
00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:13.593
How did your uneducated kind
ever take Jerusalem?

352
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:14.845
God knows.

353
00:34:15.012 --> 00:34:16.430
What is it?

354
00:34:25.773 --> 00:34:27.816
What is it?
It's Nottingham's soldiers.

355
00:34:27.984 --> 00:34:30.986
Coming here? Is this your protection?

356
00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:34.322
I killed some of the sheriff's men.
Oh, dear.

357
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:37.159
I fear I have placed you in danger.

358
00:34:37.326 --> 00:34:39.619
I can take care of myself.
Just go!

359
00:34:39.787 --> 00:34:41.913
No, that's my horse!

360
00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:44.416
A truly magnificent animal, my lady.

361
00:34:47.628 --> 00:34:49.171
Come on!

362
00:34:51.507 --> 00:34:54.259
Go!
I said, I'm sworn to protect you.

363
00:34:54.427 --> 00:34:56.595
And I say no more boyish gestures.

364
00:34:56.763 --> 00:34:58.764
I'm not leaving.

365
00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:04.811
Stop them!
They're stealing my horses!

366
00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:08.690
You're so kind, Marian.

367
00:35:27.502 --> 00:35:29.377
Been sheltering outlaws,
Lady Marian?

368
00:35:29.712 --> 00:35:34.007
They're thieves, you imbecile.
Lucky he didn't steal your virtue as well.

369
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:37.469
A crown to the man who brings me
Locksley's head! My lady.

370
00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:22.347
Have we lost them?

371
00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:24.599
No!

372
00:36:25.101 --> 00:36:28.728
My horse carries two. Yours is lame.
We cannot outrun them.

373
00:36:28.896 --> 00:36:32.399
Leave me, Master Robin!
I slow your escape.

374
00:36:33.985 --> 00:36:37.112
We can lose them in the forest.
Sherwood Forest is haunted.

375
00:36:37.697 --> 00:36:41.366
Either we take our chances with ghosts
or become ghosts ourselves.

376
00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:05.223
Come on, damn you!

377
00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:06.892
There are only three of them!

378
00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:10.729
It's not the men we fear, sir.
It's the evil spirits.

379
00:37:10.897 --> 00:37:12.981
Robin of the Hood!

380
00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:15.525
Son of a devil worshiper!

381
00:37:15.693 --> 00:37:17.652
Your father died a coward...

382
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.573
cursing your name
and squealing like a stuck pig!

383
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:25.744
You will bring no justice to your father
by dying today.

384
00:37:54.815 --> 00:37:56.524
Master Robin?

385
00:37:56.692 --> 00:37:59.361
There are your ghosts, Duncan.

386
00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:01.237
Wind chimes.

387
00:38:01.405 --> 00:38:04.032
A child's toy put to good use.

388
00:38:05.326 --> 00:38:08.244
You scare easily, my painted Moor.

389
00:38:12.041 --> 00:38:14.376
This forest has eyes.

390
00:38:14.752 --> 00:38:16.544
I swear it.

391
00:38:35.022 --> 00:38:39.109
In my dreams alone
have I imagined such a place.

392
00:38:40.736 --> 00:38:43.238
Then imagine a way to cross it.

393
00:39:14.979 --> 00:39:16.855
There's hope!

394
00:39:21.652 --> 00:39:24.279
There was a rich man from Nottingham.

395
00:39:24.447 --> 00:39:26.448
Who tried to cross the river.

396
00:39:26.615 --> 00:39:29.034
What a dope He tripped on a rope.

397
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:31.453
Now look at him shiver.

398
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.414
Beg for mercy, rich man!

399
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.294
I beg of no man.

400
00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:55.018
This here is our river, and any man
who wishes to cross must pay a tax.

401
00:39:55.186 --> 00:39:57.562
I will pay no tax.

402
00:39:58.064 --> 00:40:01.149
As you can see, I have nothing.

403
00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:04.944
Not even my sword.
Bollocks!

404
00:40:05.738 --> 00:40:08.156
Any man who travels with two servants...

405
00:40:08.324 --> 00:40:11.159
and claims he's got no bloody money...

406
00:40:11.327 --> 00:40:16.164
is either a fool or a liar.
Yeah, he's a liar!

407
00:40:16.332 --> 00:40:19.375
Who are you?
John Little.

408
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:23.421
Best man of the woods.
Eh, lads?

409
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:26.091
Tell him, John!
That's right!

410
00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:31.513
Well, best man, you lead this rabble?

411
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.681
Yes, I do, mate.

412
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:38.853
And if you tosspots want to travel through
Sherwood Forest, it's gonna cost you...

413
00:40:39.021 --> 00:40:41.606
that gold medallion.

414
00:40:46.278 --> 00:40:48.029
This is sacred to me.

415
00:40:48.197 --> 00:40:50.615
It's sacred to us too, mate.

416
00:40:51.283 --> 00:40:54.577
That there will feed us
for a blooming month.

417
00:40:54.745 --> 00:40:57.705
You'll have to fight me for it.

418
00:40:58.165 --> 00:40:59.707
Love to, mate.

419
00:41:06.132 --> 00:41:07.715
Be careful, Father.

420
00:41:07.883 --> 00:41:10.009
He walloped 12 of the sheriff's men.

421
00:41:10.177 --> 00:41:12.053
Is that so?

422
00:41:12.805 --> 00:41:14.722
Reckon I'm gonna enjoy this.

423
00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:17.058
Hey.

424
00:41:18.269 --> 00:41:20.311
That's your father?

425
00:41:25.568 --> 00:41:26.734
You should help me.

426
00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:52.135
Wee!

427
00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:55.054
He's drowning!

428
00:41:56.724 --> 00:41:58.433
Lost something?

429
00:42:00.436 --> 00:42:03.188
Thanks for the taxes.

430
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.941
Looks like the little rich boy's
lost for words, eh?

431
00:42:08.319 --> 00:42:12.488
Any great ideas?
Get up! Move faster!

432
00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.450
Move faster. Great idea.

433
00:42:22.833 --> 00:42:24.709
Watch it, John!

434
00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:32.300
We're not through yet.
All right, my old cocker.

435
00:42:32.593 --> 00:42:34.802
You want another good walloping?

436
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.846
You shall have one.

437
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:51.110
Seems I've made it past the gate,
John Little.

438
00:42:51.362 --> 00:42:55.615
Or should I call you Little John?
Hit him, Father! Wallop him!

439
00:43:05.709 --> 00:43:07.919
You can do it!
Good shot!

440
00:43:08.963 --> 00:43:11.714
You've bloodied him, John,
you've bloodied him.

441
00:43:18.138 --> 00:43:20.431
Swimming time again, old chum.

442
00:43:34.697 --> 00:43:37.699
Where is he? Do you see him?

443
00:43:50.254 --> 00:43:52.755
It's a blooming shame!

444
00:43:52.923 --> 00:43:54.924
He was a brave lad!

445
00:43:59.888 --> 00:44:01.556
Help!

446
00:44:01.932 --> 00:44:05.643
Do you yield?
I can't bloody swim!

447
00:44:07.771 --> 00:44:09.564
Do you yield?
Yes!

448
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.359
Good. Now put your feet down.

449
00:44:18.407 --> 00:44:19.866
I'll be buggered.

450
00:44:21.243 --> 00:44:25.413
The medallion.
Give me your name first.

451
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:27.665
Robin of Locksley.

452
00:44:28.083 --> 00:44:31.294
Well, Robin of Locksley...

453
00:44:31.462 --> 00:44:34.339
you got balls of solid rock.
Come on.

454
00:44:38.594 --> 00:44:41.596
That's Much, the miller's son,
Harold Brownwell.

455
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:47.018
That stumpy one is David of Doncaster,
but the lads all calls him Bull.

456
00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.979
Because you're short?
Nope.

457
00:44:50.439 --> 00:44:52.899
It's because I'm so long!

458
00:44:55.903 --> 00:45:00.615
They ought to have a look.
No, Bull, save it! Save it for the ladies.

459
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:03.618
Give the man some mead.

460
00:45:06.705 --> 00:45:08.623
Now, I made that myself.

461
00:45:10.709 --> 00:45:13.961
Has English hospitality
changed so much in six years...

462
00:45:14.129 --> 00:45:16.798
that a friend of mine's not welcome
at this table?

463
00:45:16.965 --> 00:45:19.342
But he's a savage, sire!

464
00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:22.303
That he is.

465
00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.432
But no more than you or I.

466
00:45:28.727 --> 00:45:30.853
And don't call me sire.

467
00:45:32.481 --> 00:45:36.192
With regret, I must decline.

468
00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:40.279
Allah forbids it.
Your bloody loss, mate.

469
00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:43.366
How is it there are so many of you
in hiding?

470
00:45:43.534 --> 00:45:47.328
We're all outlaws.
Got prices on our heads.

471
00:45:47.496 --> 00:45:48.996
Even the young lad there.

472
00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:53.376
It's that blasted sheriff,
he says we owes him taxes.

473
00:45:53.544 --> 00:45:57.755
You know, your ghosts will only keep
the sheriff's men at bay so long.

474
00:45:57.923 --> 00:46:00.883
They've worked so far.
You have a better idea?

475
00:46:07.141 --> 00:46:09.142
We can always fight back.

476
00:46:12.104 --> 00:46:15.189
I reckon I must've cracked
that noble head of yours.

477
00:46:15.357 --> 00:46:17.692
These are all good lads here.

478
00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.361
They've got hearts of oak,
but they're farmers.

479
00:46:22.322 --> 00:46:24.824
It'd be lambs to the slaughter.

480
00:46:24.992 --> 00:46:27.743
They say the sheriff
was raised by a witch.

481
00:46:27.911 --> 00:46:30.246
A witch?
She knows every man's thoughts.

482
00:46:30.414 --> 00:46:34.417
You can see through her. And she flies.
That's a load of codswallop.

483
00:46:34.585 --> 00:46:38.212
What does the rich son of a devil worshiper
care what happens to outlaw peasants?

484
00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:40.923
My lord was a kind and generous man!

485
00:46:41.091 --> 00:46:44.177
Who among you dares
believe him capable...?

486
00:46:44.344 --> 00:46:46.929
My father was no devil worshiper.

487
00:46:48.182 --> 00:46:51.309
And I'll have words with any man
who says otherwise.

488
00:46:54.146 --> 00:46:56.022
But he's right.

489
00:46:58.108 --> 00:47:00.401
I was a rich man's son.

490
00:47:02.488 --> 00:47:05.573
But when I killed the sheriff's men...

491
00:47:06.742 --> 00:47:09.702
I became an outlaw like you.
You are nothing like us.

492
00:47:12.789 --> 00:47:14.957
That there's Will Scarlett.

493
00:47:15.125 --> 00:47:18.544
Don't take no notice of him.
He's full of piss and wind.

494
00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:21.422
Come on, lads, drink up.

495
00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:24.175
Stop talking so much bloody rubbish.

496
00:47:24.343 --> 00:47:27.970
This here is the best
that we simple men can expect.

497
00:47:28.138 --> 00:47:30.306
Here we're safe.

498
00:47:30.933 --> 00:47:34.060
Here we are kings.

499
00:47:59.127 --> 00:48:02.296
Too much mead, old friend?
Forgive me, I oversleep.

500
00:48:02.464 --> 00:48:05.174
No. No, no. Rest yourself.

501
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:18.187
What day is it, Duncan?
Sunday, I think.

502
00:48:19.856 --> 00:48:22.233
Do they still give alms
to the poor at Mass?

503
00:48:22.401 --> 00:48:23.776
That they do.

504
00:48:23.944 --> 00:48:27.947
These days, the need for mercy
is greater than ever.

505
00:48:43.547 --> 00:48:46.132
Well, my other god calls.

506
00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:50.261
Oh, don't upset yourself, Mortianna.

507
00:48:50.429 --> 00:48:54.348
Appearances are important to that lot,
especially on a Sunday.

508
00:48:54.516 --> 00:48:58.936
You know my true faith
lies in the old ways.

509
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:02.690
Although...

510
00:49:02.858 --> 00:49:05.943
frankly, sometimes...

511
00:49:07.529 --> 00:49:10.031
I can't see much difference.

512
00:49:12.701 --> 00:49:17.496
Did my parents truly tell you
to instruct me in all this?

513
00:49:18.457 --> 00:49:20.791
Their dying wish.

514
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:03.751
We beseech thy blessing, Lord...

515
00:50:03.919 --> 00:50:08.756
on all your people,
but most especially...

516
00:50:08.924 --> 00:50:12.259
on our noble Sheriff of Nottingham.

517
00:50:12.928 --> 00:50:16.597
Grant him the wisdom
to guide and protect...

518
00:50:16.765 --> 00:50:19.266
our glorious city.

519
00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:21.769
Grant him also the strength...

520
00:50:21.937 --> 00:50:25.606
to bring to justice
the lawless men...

521
00:50:25.774 --> 00:50:30.152
who would threaten its safety
and prosperity.

522
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.030
And the judgment
to punish them...

523
00:50:33.198 --> 00:50:36.492
in your name. Amen.

524
00:50:37.411 --> 00:50:39.245
Amen.

525
00:50:39.413 --> 00:50:41.205
Go in peace.

526
00:50:49.798 --> 00:50:51.424
Sarah?
Yes.

527
00:50:54.886 --> 00:50:57.596
That's all I have.
God bless you, ma'am.

528
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.534
Alms for a blind man, my lady?

529
00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:22.246
For one who cannot see your beauty?

530
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:28.544
Hello.
What are you doing here?

531
00:51:28.712 --> 00:51:31.172
Searching my soul.

532
00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:34.508
I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.

533
00:51:34.676 --> 00:51:37.178
Do you prefer the company of Nottingham?

534
00:51:37.345 --> 00:51:39.054
There's a price on your head.

535
00:51:39.222 --> 00:51:41.724
How much?
One hundred gold pieces.

536
00:51:41.892 --> 00:51:43.684
Is that all?

537
00:51:43.852 --> 00:51:47.730
I shall have to annoy the good
sheriff more. Soon it will be 1000.

538
00:51:47.898 --> 00:51:50.483
For 1000, I would turn you in myself.

539
00:51:51.443 --> 00:51:53.027
Nottingham is mounting an army.

540
00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:57.531
He has every blacksmith in the county holed
up in the castle making swords and armor.

541
00:51:57.699 --> 00:51:59.950
What is he planning?
I don't know.

542
00:52:00.118 --> 00:52:02.995
But there's no limit
to the man's ambitions.

543
00:52:04.956 --> 00:52:07.750
Go. Quickly, go!
Thank you.

544
00:52:08.877 --> 00:52:10.336
Robin, do something for me.

545
00:52:10.504 --> 00:52:12.713
What?
Take a bath.

546
00:52:12.881 --> 00:52:14.882
Take a bath?

547
00:52:33.902 --> 00:52:37.279
These are my private chambers, my son.

548
00:52:38.073 --> 00:52:41.158
I have priests who would
hear your confession.

549
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:51.836
I see the boy I knew
in the man before me.

550
00:52:53.255 --> 00:52:55.422
Welcome home, Robin.

551
00:52:57.592 --> 00:53:00.135
You shine like the sun, my lady.

552
00:53:00.303 --> 00:53:03.097
You've been meeting
with Robin of Locksley.

553
00:53:03.265 --> 00:53:07.393
My cousin tells me the knave
deprived you of some horses.

554
00:53:07.561 --> 00:53:10.521
Yes, a most disagreeable experience.
Yes, I know.

555
00:53:10.689 --> 00:53:12.690
And for inflicting that upon you...

556
00:53:12.858 --> 00:53:15.734
I'm going to hang him from the walls
by his entrails.

557
00:53:15.902 --> 00:53:16.944
I'd like to see that.

558
00:53:17.112 --> 00:53:19.697
If you'd bring your household
within the city...

559
00:53:19.865 --> 00:53:22.199
I could give your needs
personal attention.

560
00:53:22.367 --> 00:53:26.871
I do thank you, but I prefer to stay
in my family's home for now.

561
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:30.916
Well, then perhaps
you'd do me the honor...

562
00:53:31.084 --> 00:53:35.796
of accepting a small token
of my undying devotion to your safety.

563
00:53:39.009 --> 00:53:43.804
King Richard would be deeply moved
to hear of your concern for my welfare.

564
00:53:43.972 --> 00:53:45.681
Yes. Um...

565
00:53:45.849 --> 00:53:49.393
I'm afraid the king has many enemies
both abroad and at home.

566
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:51.645
I fear for his safe return.

567
00:53:51.813 --> 00:53:54.607
Oh, no, fear not, dear sheriff.
He will return.

568
00:53:54.774 --> 00:53:59.361
And when he does, he will wish
to reward his faithful subjects.

569
00:54:03.408 --> 00:54:08.495
I asked your father three times
if he worshiped the dark one...

570
00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:13.125
because his answer vexed me
so grievously.

571
00:54:13.877 --> 00:54:15.669
He said...

572
00:54:15.837 --> 00:54:21.091
he must meet God
with a clear conscience.

573
00:54:30.602 --> 00:54:32.728
You lie.

574
00:54:39.027 --> 00:54:42.279
On your souls, do not shed blood
in the house of God!

575
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:53.415
You bastard! In there!

576
00:54:53.667 --> 00:54:54.959
Get him!

577
00:55:00.674 --> 00:55:02.383
Locksley!

578
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.387
I'm going to cut your heart out
with a spoon!

579
00:55:07.055 --> 00:55:08.973
Then it begins.

580
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:28.826
He's taking the sheriff's horse!
He's stealing the sheriff's horse!

581
00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:32.955
Close that gate!

582
00:55:33.623 --> 00:55:38.043
The sheriff's horse! Close the gate!
He's stolen the sheriff's horse.

583
00:55:55.979 --> 00:55:58.397
What are you looking at?!

584
00:56:18.626 --> 00:56:20.002
Water!

585
00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.838
Thank you.
For the animal.

586
00:56:23.006 --> 00:56:26.925
How can I protect you, Christian,
if I know not where you go?

587
00:56:27.093 --> 00:56:30.387
You've hardly raised a finger
when you do know...

588
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:32.347
great one.

589
00:56:32.515 --> 00:56:34.433
I prefer to have the choice.

590
00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:36.852
Wonderful! You've stolen
the sheriff's horse?

591
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.980
You've stirred up
a bloody hornet's nest now!

592
00:56:40.148 --> 00:56:42.816
Are you afraid, John?
Yeah, a little.

593
00:56:42.984 --> 00:56:47.321
So is the sheriff. And today
I gave him a sting he'll not forget.

594
00:56:47.489 --> 00:56:51.533
You fool! You've started a war!
We're already at war.

595
00:56:54.329 --> 00:56:55.996
Bread.

596
00:56:57.499 --> 00:57:00.667
And I say we strike back at the very man
who takes our homes...

597
00:57:00.835 --> 00:57:03.212
and would hunt our children.
We?

598
00:57:04.005 --> 00:57:06.673
You planning to join us then, matey?

599
00:57:07.717 --> 00:57:09.676
No, to lead you.

600
00:57:14.015 --> 00:57:15.599
Christian.

601
00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:17.851
These are simple people.

602
00:57:18.019 --> 00:57:20.145
They are not warriors.

603
00:57:20.313 --> 00:57:23.357
Be careful you do not do this
for your own purposes.

604
00:57:23.525 --> 00:57:27.861
You forget yourself, Azeem.
I do not ask for your company or council.

605
00:57:30.406 --> 00:57:33.534
Why a spoon, cousin?
Why not an ax?

606
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:37.996
Because it's dull, you twit!
It'll hurt more!

607
00:57:38.164 --> 00:57:41.542
I want this brigand found.

608
00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:43.293
Starve them out!

609
00:57:43.461 --> 00:57:46.380
Slaughter their...
No, take their livestock.

610
00:57:46.548 --> 00:57:49.800
I want Locksley's own people
fighting to bring his head in.

611
00:57:49.968 --> 00:57:53.053
Perhaps we could create a name for him.

612
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:56.014
Something to drive fear into the hearts
of the populace.

613
00:57:56.182 --> 00:57:59.393
"Locksley the Lethal" or "Wreaking Robin."
Whatever.

614
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:03.397
I want him dead by the next full moon,
before the barons come back.

615
00:58:03.565 --> 00:58:05.691
Now sew!

616
00:58:07.068 --> 00:58:10.445
And keep the stitches small.

617
00:58:29.048 --> 00:58:31.175
He's not here, sir.

618
00:58:32.051 --> 00:58:34.595
Where is your mate,
the man they call Little?

619
00:58:34.762 --> 00:58:38.599
He died last winter.
Burn it down!

620
00:58:45.231 --> 00:58:48.358
Leave us the sow. Her young
will feed us through winter.

621
00:58:48.526 --> 00:58:52.446
You heard of the Sherwood bandit?
Robin of the Hood? Yes, sir.

622
00:58:52.614 --> 00:58:55.782
Pray he is brought to us
before winter.

623
00:59:01.956 --> 00:59:03.749
Over here!

624
00:59:06.628 --> 00:59:09.588
Alfred! What's happened to you?

625
00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.137
Oh, John!
Fanny!

626
00:59:17.305 --> 00:59:20.349
Will, they burned it, all of it.
Are you all right?

627
00:59:21.851 --> 00:59:23.852
Where is this Robin Hood?

628
00:59:24.354 --> 00:59:25.729
He's there.

629
00:59:27.106 --> 00:59:30.234
Look! Look what they've done!

630
00:59:34.072 --> 00:59:36.823
If it's fame you seek, Christian...

631
00:59:36.991 --> 00:59:39.868
I think you have it.

632
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:44.665
You brought this misery on us, Locksley.

633
00:59:44.832 --> 00:59:49.044
It's Nottingham trying to divide us.
We are divided, rich boy.

634
00:59:49.212 --> 00:59:51.255
I'm not blind as that old man
over there.

635
00:59:51.422 --> 00:59:54.508
You're still trying to be
lord of the manor.

636
00:59:54.676 --> 00:59:59.972
I heard today that the sheriff
now values your neck at 500 gold pieces.

637
01:00:01.057 --> 01:00:03.600
I say we take him in.

638
01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:09.856
Will, do you think the sheriff will give
everything back after I'm gone?

639
01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:13.318
He'll give us the reward and our pardons.
Wrong!

640
01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:18.323
He'll stretch your necks one by one.

641
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.742
What would you have us do?

642
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:25.247
Fight armored men on horseback
with rocks and our bare hands?

643
01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:27.291
If needs be.

644
01:00:28.543 --> 01:00:31.753
But with the one true weapon
that escapes you, Will.

645
01:00:32.839 --> 01:00:34.214
Courage.

646
01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:43.640
Look out!

647
01:00:58.156 --> 01:01:00.073
Thank you, Wulf.

648
01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:03.118
You wish to end this?
Yeah.

649
01:01:03.286 --> 01:01:05.162
You wish to go home?
Aye.

650
01:01:05.330 --> 01:01:09.082
Then we must stop fighting
amongst ourselves...

651
01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:12.127
and face that the price for it
may be dear.

652
01:01:12.712 --> 01:01:14.588
I, for one, would rather die...

653
01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:17.215
than spend my life in hiding.

654
01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:19.760
The sheriff calls us outlaws.

655
01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:22.637
But I say we are free.

656
01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:25.390
And one free man defending his home...

657
01:01:25.558 --> 01:01:29.144
is more powerful than 10 hired soldiers.

658
01:01:31.314 --> 01:01:33.774
The Crusades taught me that.

659
01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:39.404
I will make you no promises save one.

660
01:01:41.199 --> 01:01:45.160
That if you truly believe
in your hearts that you are free...

661
01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:48.038
then I say we can win.

662
01:01:48.206 --> 01:01:50.415
They got armor!

663
01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:52.626
They got armor, Bull?

664
01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:55.962
Even this boy can be taught
to find the chinks in armor.

665
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.131
But we ain't got nothing to eat!

666
01:01:58.299 --> 01:02:02.511
What do we need that the forest
cannot provide? We have food.

667
01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:04.888
Wood for weapons.

668
01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:07.224
We'll find safety and solace
in her trees.

669
01:02:07.392 --> 01:02:13.271
Yeah, but what about our kin?
Sheriff's taken all they got too!

670
01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:17.567
Then, by God, we take it back.

671
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:03.798
What's the meaning of this?

672
01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:08.512
Milady. A woman of your beauty
has no need for such decorations.

673
01:04:09.305 --> 01:04:11.598
How dare you!

674
01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.777
Please don't take that!
Don't take that!

675
01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:29.282
Please, sir! Those belong to our Lord.
Now they belong to my lord sheriff!

676
01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.297
Give it back.

677
01:04:45.675 --> 01:04:46.716
Good.

678
01:04:47.176 --> 01:04:52.556
Tell the sheriff for every harm he does these
people, I will visit it back on him tenfold.

679
01:05:01.607 --> 01:05:03.775
Something vexes thee?

680
01:05:14.954 --> 01:05:18.290
What the devil?
'Tis a hot day, my friend...

681
01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:20.792
to burden your horse
with such a heavy purse.

682
01:05:21.168 --> 01:05:23.086
The sheriff will hear of this!

683
01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:29.259
I truly hope so.

684
01:05:37.935 --> 01:05:40.228
There you go, love.
Buy yourself a new sow.

685
01:05:40.396 --> 01:05:43.315
God bless you, Fanny.

686
01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:45.066
And God bless Robin Hood!

687
01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:54.034
We reckon he's nicked 3 to 4 million
in the last five months, sire.

688
01:05:54.201 --> 01:05:57.203
All right then, fine.
Raise the bounty on his head.

689
01:05:57.371 --> 01:05:59.039
Twenty-five thousand crowns.

690
01:05:59.206 --> 01:06:03.877
Begging your pardon, it won't do no good
how much you raise it.

691
01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:06.963
Really, scribe, and why is that?
Because, sire...

692
01:06:07.131 --> 01:06:10.717
the poor, you see.
He gives them what he takes.

693
01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:13.970
So, well, sire, they love him.

694
01:06:17.308 --> 01:06:19.225
Just a minute.

695
01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.936
Robin Hood steals money
from my pocket...

696
01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:25.190
forcing me to hurt the public...

697
01:06:25.358 --> 01:06:28.068
and they love him for it?

698
01:06:28.569 --> 01:06:30.445
Yes.

699
01:06:31.572 --> 01:06:33.406
That's it then!

700
01:06:33.574 --> 01:06:36.117
Cancel the kitchen scraps
for lepers and orphans.

701
01:06:36.285 --> 01:06:39.120
No more merciful beheadings.

702
01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:41.498
And call off Christmas!

703
01:06:43.084 --> 01:06:44.793
The treasury is empty.

704
01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:47.170
All day and all night
people plague my door...

705
01:06:47.338 --> 01:06:50.924
whining for tax relief and safe passage
through Sherwood Forest.

706
01:06:51.092 --> 01:06:53.426
"We can't pay thee
what the highwayman's taken."

707
01:06:53.594 --> 01:06:56.096
It's the shortest route to London, sire!

708
01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:59.265
It's the only road to London,
you little ferret.

709
01:07:00.267 --> 01:07:03.311
Sir Guy's patrols
have found nothing, sire?

710
01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:05.980
No camp. Nothing!

711
01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.945
This hooded viper
simply slithers into the forest.

712
01:07:12.113 --> 01:07:16.616
You, my room, 10:30 tonight.
You, 10:45.

713
01:07:16.784 --> 01:07:18.576
Bring a friend.

714
01:07:35.553 --> 01:07:37.971
Tongue offends thee.

715
01:07:38.973 --> 01:07:41.933
Whose?
One who writes all.

716
01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:50.108
That horrible little scribe, his tongue?
Cut it out.

717
01:08:19.722 --> 01:08:21.306
How many?

718
01:08:21.474 --> 01:08:22.891
Twenty.

719
01:08:23.058 --> 01:08:24.601
Twenty?!

720
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:27.145
How many?

721
01:08:27.313 --> 01:08:29.189
Five.

722
01:08:30.441 --> 01:08:32.650
They can't count anyway.
Come on.

723
01:08:32.818 --> 01:08:34.903
Why scare them?

724
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:37.113
And they call me barbarian.

725
01:08:45.873 --> 01:08:47.749
Friar!

726
01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:51.503
You shall find it more difficult to sing
with a sword in your gullet.

727
01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:54.130
Yes, my lord.

728
01:08:56.592 --> 01:09:00.845
Shut up and help me move this log!
This isn't a log, it's a tree!

729
01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:03.097
Shut up! You're supposed to
be helping me!

730
01:09:03.265 --> 01:09:05.016
I'm supposed to be meeting a girl!

731
01:09:11.816 --> 01:09:15.777
You men in front, after me.
The rest stay with the wagon!

732
01:09:18.864 --> 01:09:20.573
On to glory!

733
01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:37.632
Bastards. Come on. Find them!

734
01:10:11.417 --> 01:10:12.458
Go!

735
01:10:21.969 --> 01:10:24.095
Welcome to Sherwood, friar!
Giddap!

736
01:10:50.205 --> 01:10:52.498
Surrender your weapons!

737
01:10:52.917 --> 01:10:56.711
Surrender your weapons,
and I give you my word you shall go free.

738
01:10:57.671 --> 01:10:59.672
Don't do that!

739
01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:03.051
What are you...?

740
01:11:20.027 --> 01:11:22.528
I'll be buggered!

741
01:11:22.696 --> 01:11:26.199
This treasure had a purpose.
We must find out what.

742
01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:44.801
Good morning, my reverend friend.

743
01:11:44.969 --> 01:11:48.638
You travel with poor company
when you travel with Nottingham's soldiers.

744
01:11:48.806 --> 01:11:51.557
Tax him!
Tax him!

745
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.438
I'm Robin of Locksley.
And my men are thirsty.

746
01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:00.608
That's right.
Robin Hood!

747
01:12:01.694 --> 01:12:04.195
Lord bless me.

748
01:12:04.905 --> 01:12:08.282
I mistook you for common thieves!

749
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:10.159
Kindly let me pass, sir.

750
01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:16.749
Surely the Lord has the charity to spare
a few barrels for good Christian men. Yes?

751
01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:20.128
We have much to celebrate.

752
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.507
Well, if you wish them to share
in the good Lord's brew...

753
01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:27.260
you must best me for it!

754
01:12:32.808 --> 01:12:36.269
Confess, Robin Hood,
that Friar Tuck is a braver...

755
01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:40.273
holier and wiser man than thou art!

756
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.293
He giveth and he taketh away.

757
01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:07.550
Do you yield?

758
01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:13.973
I'd rather roast in hell.

759
01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.603
Shoot him! Shoot him!

760
01:13:33.577 --> 01:13:37.080
I think the good friar's
taken us far enough.

761
01:13:38.165 --> 01:13:40.124
Well done, friar.

762
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:43.961
Thank you, Lord,
for teaching me humility.

763
01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:54.972
Well, Tuck...
Thanks for the beer.

764
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.934
Are these not the meek of the earth?

765
01:13:58.185 --> 01:14:01.437
We're in need of an honest man
to minister to them.

766
01:14:02.022 --> 01:14:03.940
What say you, friar?

767
01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:11.322
The Lord reveals himself
in mysterious ways.

768
01:14:13.117 --> 01:14:15.368
I accept.
Good.

769
01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:17.954
You will not regret it.

770
01:14:18.122 --> 01:14:20.498
Aye, but you may!

771
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:54.490
We were ambushed, cousin.

772
01:14:58.579 --> 01:15:03.499
Spanish steel. Much stronger
than our native blades.

773
01:15:06.253 --> 01:15:07.628
Any losses?

774
01:15:08.046 --> 01:15:09.672
Some.

775
01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:15.887
In truth, all of them.

776
01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:19.098
And the gold?
Taken.

777
01:15:20.434 --> 01:15:22.435
Robin Hood?

778
01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:25.980
They were woodsmen, cousin.

779
01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.484
Robin Hood.

780
01:15:31.695 --> 01:15:33.279
I tried.

781
01:15:34.323 --> 01:15:36.657
I tried.
Cousin...

782
01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:39.243
I tried. I tried.
Cousin...

783
01:15:39.411 --> 01:15:41.120
we must be strong.

784
01:15:41.288 --> 01:15:44.790
We can't allow an outlaw
to make fools of us.

785
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:48.252
And I can't allow a lieutenant...

786
01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.755
to fail me.

787
01:16:04.478 --> 01:16:07.688
Well, at least I didn't use a spoon.

788
01:16:10.234 --> 01:16:11.692
That's good steel.

789
01:16:23.497 --> 01:16:26.499
Take the one on the left.
Which one's left?

790
01:16:28.418 --> 01:16:30.670
Which one you taking?
What do you mean?

791
01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:34.423
If you take the one on the left,
I'm taking the one on the right.

792
01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:38.469
Which one's the one on the right?
The one next to the one on the...

793
01:16:38.971 --> 01:16:41.430
Bollocks. We'll just jump out
and grab them.

794
01:16:42.557 --> 01:16:43.808
Now?
Now!

795
01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:48.521
Donation, if you please.

796
01:16:48.689 --> 01:16:51.774
Donation? For what?

797
01:16:52.526 --> 01:16:53.943
What?

798
01:16:55.404 --> 01:16:58.197
For passage through Sherwood.
Very well.

799
01:16:59.491 --> 01:17:01.242
Come and get it.

800
01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:09.375
You stunted shrub!
How dare you attack us?

801
01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:11.877
It's me job, my lady.
Job?

802
01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:15.381
And who is your employer?
Robin Hood.

803
01:17:19.219 --> 01:17:21.721
I insist on seeing him at once.

804
01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:25.308
I'm trying to stop them!

805
01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:30.062
You cannot go down there!
My lady, don't rush, you'll fall.

806
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:33.941
He's not expecting you!
My lady's intrusion is simply tit for tat.

807
01:17:34.109 --> 01:17:36.402
Out of the way, old traps!
Don't "old traps" me!

808
01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.404
I told you, you can't go down there!

809
01:17:46.163 --> 01:17:49.248
Ooh! Oh, I say.
Cover your eyes.

810
01:17:49.416 --> 01:17:52.418
My lady, don't!

811
01:18:02.095 --> 01:18:04.305
You could've said!

812
01:18:06.683 --> 01:18:09.935
Robin! You got visitors!

813
01:18:14.107 --> 01:18:17.151
It weren't my fault!
Madam, you be careful there.

814
01:18:17.319 --> 01:18:21.989
It was Much!
Careful you don't slip.

815
01:18:25.452 --> 01:18:26.577
Hello.

816
01:18:28.997 --> 01:18:31.123
What are you doing here?

817
01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:37.171
Taking a lady's advice.

818
01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:40.716
What happened to your eye, Bull?

819
01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:43.010
We was set upon by 10...
Twelve!

820
01:18:43.178 --> 01:18:46.138
Fifteen large, big lads!
Oh, yeah?

821
01:18:46.306 --> 01:18:47.973
Yeah.

822
01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.987
You've been busy.

823
01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:05.199
We have guests!
Bring them down!

824
01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.712
It works.

825
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.589
Kind of.

826
01:19:21.258 --> 01:19:22.883
Of course it works.

827
01:19:24.511 --> 01:19:26.387
Great shot!

828
01:19:27.264 --> 01:19:29.265
Take your time, now.

829
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.273
That's good, Wulf.
But can you do it amidst distraction?

830
01:19:37.441 --> 01:19:40.359
Can you make the shot when you must?

831
01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:44.447
Show him, Wulf.

832
01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.374
Can you?

833
01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:59.044
Well, go on, then.
It was a dirty trick.

834
01:20:00.005 --> 01:20:04.550
Aren't we all very serious?
Is his shirt coming off?

835
01:20:08.889 --> 01:20:11.891
Fair's fair. Come on, chaps.
Fair's fair.

836
01:20:25.822 --> 01:20:27.865
Well done. Well done.

837
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:33.245
This is grain, which any fool can eat...

838
01:20:33.413 --> 01:20:38.626
but for which the Lord intended
a more divine means of consumption.

839
01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:43.130
Let us give praise to our maker
and glory to his bounty...

840
01:20:43.298 --> 01:20:45.049
by learning about...

841
01:20:45.217 --> 01:20:47.051
beer.

842
01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:56.060
Did you bring me here to brag?

843
01:20:59.523 --> 01:21:01.857
This is blood money, Marian.

844
01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:05.402
It's intended to bribe King Richard's
enemies to unite against him.

845
01:21:06.655 --> 01:21:09.031
We intercepted it.

846
01:21:10.116 --> 01:21:12.368
But who would...?
Nottingham.

847
01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:17.498
He would not dare challenge the king.
The king is not here to be challenged.

848
01:21:17.958 --> 01:21:20.668
While he's away,
he may lose his country.

849
01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.714
You thought...

850
01:21:25.882 --> 01:21:29.301
You thought I was keeping it all,
didn't you?

851
01:21:30.136 --> 01:21:31.804
Didn't you?

852
01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.139
Well, here.

853
01:21:34.558 --> 01:21:36.559
A contribution to your cause.

854
01:21:36.726 --> 01:21:38.978
Keep it.
This dagger would fetch a great price.

855
01:21:39.145 --> 01:21:41.647
Keep it.
It's not dear to me.

856
01:21:41.815 --> 01:21:43.941
I mean, it is...
It's not.

857
01:21:45.819 --> 01:21:47.528
I'm saying everything wrong.
I'll...

858
01:21:50.448 --> 01:21:52.116
Cheers.

859
01:21:58.123 --> 01:22:00.624
How do I get down?

860
01:22:04.504 --> 01:22:06.297
Wait! Wait!

861
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:11.093
We don't go that way anymore.

862
01:22:11.261 --> 01:22:12.761
I'm happy to hear that.

863
01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:14.513
Grab on.

864
01:22:17.684 --> 01:22:19.685
We have a rule here, you know.

865
01:22:19.853 --> 01:22:23.814
Once someone has seen the way
to our camp, that person cannot leave.

866
01:22:24.316 --> 01:22:26.775
There's too many lives at stake.

867
01:22:27.694 --> 01:22:30.654
That's why Sarah and I
asked to be blindfolded.

868
01:22:33.700 --> 01:22:36.452
Well, perhaps you might join us
for dinner?

869
01:22:37.037 --> 01:22:38.454
Perhaps.

870
01:22:56.848 --> 01:22:58.515
Salaam, little one.

871
01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:02.519
Did God paint you?
Did God paint me?

872
01:23:04.939 --> 01:23:07.816
For certain.
Why?

873
01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:11.779
Because...

874
01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:14.406
Allah loves wondrous variety.

875
01:23:16.618 --> 01:23:21.705
You see, that is why
your hair is brown and your...

876
01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:25.250
Keep thy heathen words
away from the ears of this innocent...

877
01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:28.003
or you'll answer to me.

878
01:23:28.171 --> 01:23:30.756
You know nothing of our God.

879
01:23:33.093 --> 01:23:36.553
Is not Allah the god
of Abraham...

880
01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:37.763
as is your God?

881
01:23:38.223 --> 01:23:40.641
Don't trick me
with twists of the devil's tongue.

882
01:23:40.809 --> 01:23:42.601
Come, child, come.

883
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:52.027
How is it that a once arrogant
young nobleman...

884
01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:56.031
has found contentment living rough
with the salt of the earth?

885
01:23:56.199 --> 01:24:00.452
I've seen knights in armor panic
at the first hint of battle.

886
01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:05.582
And I've seen the lowliest unarmed squire
pull a spear from his own body...

887
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.584
to defend a dying horse.

888
01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.630
Nobility's not a birthright.

889
01:24:12.799 --> 01:24:14.758
It's defined by one's actions.

890
01:24:17.345 --> 01:24:19.888
It's interesting to hear you say that.

891
01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:21.807
I didn't.

892
01:24:21.975 --> 01:24:23.684
My father did.

893
01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:30.816
Did the holy quest
erase your hatred of him?

894
01:24:30.984 --> 01:24:32.609
I don't know.

895
01:24:33.945 --> 01:24:39.742
All I know is that our last words
in this world were spoken in anger.

896
01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.036
I was lost after my mother died.

897
01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:47.166
My father too. And for a short time
he found comfort...

898
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:50.836
in the arms of another woman.
A peasant woman.

899
01:24:53.673 --> 01:24:55.758
I thought he was betraying
my mother's memory.

900
01:24:56.176 --> 01:24:58.010
So he gave her up?

901
01:24:59.804 --> 01:25:03.807
For the love of a 12-year-old boy
who would never forgive him.

902
01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:11.440
Anyway, who...?

903
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.067
Who says I'm content?

904
01:25:14.235 --> 01:25:17.237
I have my plans for the future.

905
01:25:18.823 --> 01:25:23.494
A grander scheme than this?
No, a simpler one.

906
01:25:24.037 --> 01:25:27.080
A home, family...

907
01:25:27.248 --> 01:25:28.665
love.

908
01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:32.920
Men speak conveniently of love
when it serves their purpose.

909
01:25:33.087 --> 01:25:36.131
And when it doesn't,
'tis a burden to them.

910
01:25:36.299 --> 01:25:39.968
Robin of the Hood, prince of thieves.

911
01:25:41.095 --> 01:25:42.930
Is he capable of love?

912
01:25:47.644 --> 01:25:49.394
Father!

913
01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:52.397
Father!

914
01:25:53.483 --> 01:25:55.692
It's Mother, she's dying!

915
01:26:04.035 --> 01:26:06.203
Fanny.

916
01:26:06.371 --> 01:26:08.831
Your baby has not turned.

917
01:26:09.332 --> 01:26:12.501
It cannot be born without help.

918
01:26:13.336 --> 01:26:17.256
He's the devil's seed sent to lead us
astray. Don't listen to him. He'll kill her!

919
01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:19.591
If you do not listen to me...

920
01:26:19.759 --> 01:26:22.594
she will certainly die.
And the child.

921
01:26:26.015 --> 01:26:28.433
The good friar's done all he can.

922
01:26:29.561 --> 01:26:32.229
I suggest you let the Moor try.

923
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.278
So be it.
Then be it on your head! I warned you.

924
01:26:40.989 --> 01:26:44.867
Marian. Get me a needle,
thread, water.

925
01:26:45.285 --> 01:26:46.660
And hurry.
Yes.

926
01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:49.288
Come with me. Come, John!

927
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.293
What are you going to do?

928
01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:58.255
I've seen it many times...

929
01:26:58.423 --> 01:27:00.090
with horses.

930
01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:03.927
With horses?

931
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:08.015
Bite down. Bite down, yes.

932
01:27:09.851 --> 01:27:11.768
Help me, Sadiq.

933
01:27:14.981 --> 01:27:16.356
Give me your arms.

934
01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:20.235
It will be all right.

935
01:27:29.621 --> 01:27:32.331
I tell you, John,
the barbarian is killing her.

936
01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:39.588
No, Father!
Out of the way, boy!

937
01:27:41.174 --> 01:27:42.883
Quick, take him. Take him.

938
01:27:48.514 --> 01:27:53.018
Ooh. What is it? Ooh, ooh.

939
01:27:59.525 --> 01:28:02.361
Your son, milady.
There you are.

940
01:28:12.956 --> 01:28:15.582
You truly are a great one.

941
01:28:17.710 --> 01:28:19.711
My son!

942
01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:24.967
Look at the lovely little baby.
Isn't he wonderful?

943
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.853
Today the Lord has taught me
a fine lesson.

944
01:28:37.021 --> 01:28:40.691
That though I may think I am godly,
I know I am not worldly.

945
01:28:40.858 --> 01:28:43.318
Please. Please.

946
01:28:47.699 --> 01:28:52.119
Come, my barbarian friend, let's open a
barrel and try to save each other's souls.

947
01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:57.124
Alas, I am not permitted.
Well, fine then. You talk, I'll drink.

948
01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:08.593
Milady!
Sarah?

949
01:29:10.763 --> 01:29:12.431
May I have this dance?

950
01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:14.975
This lady is spoken for.

951
01:29:57.518 --> 01:29:59.394
Why this way?

952
01:30:00.063 --> 01:30:04.107
So you cannot find the way back
or be forced to tell others the way.

953
01:30:07.862 --> 01:30:10.405
It was good to see you again, Marian.

954
01:30:11.324 --> 01:30:13.241
It was good to be seen.

955
01:30:15.161 --> 01:30:17.454
I have two favors to ask of you.

956
01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:21.083
One.

957
01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:25.295
Take Duncan with you. I fear for his health
with what may lie ahead.

958
01:30:26.589 --> 01:30:29.216
Besides, I grow tired of his bellyaching.

959
01:30:29.383 --> 01:30:31.510
You wish me to leave, Master Robin?

960
01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:33.470
Old friend, listen to me.

961
01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:37.182
Can you take Lady Marian safely home?

962
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:39.226
I fear for her safety.

963
01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:41.895
Of course, sire.
Good.

964
01:30:42.063 --> 01:30:44.022
Bull.

965
01:30:50.947 --> 01:30:53.949
And two?
Yes, two.

966
01:30:56.911 --> 01:30:59.246
You're King Richard's cousin.

967
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.583
You can get word to him
of Nottingham's plan.

968
01:31:04.377 --> 01:31:06.294
He would believe you.

969
01:31:06.963 --> 01:31:10.382
If the sheriff found out,
I could lose all that I have.

970
01:31:12.093 --> 01:31:14.052
That's true.

971
01:31:15.429 --> 01:31:17.973
But will you do it for your king?

972
01:31:18.432 --> 01:31:19.474
No.

973
01:31:22.854 --> 01:31:24.980
I'll do it for you.

974
01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:46.751
He fancies you, my lady.

975
01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:52.883
I am blind, but some things
I can still see.

976
01:32:10.943 --> 01:32:14.529
In 10 days' time, the barons are coming.

977
01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.824
Robin Hood has stolen what I was to pay
for their allegiance.

978
01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:22.537
And I am surrounded by fools
who do not realize my obligations.

979
01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:25.665
Tell me, Mortianna...

980
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:28.251
am I thwarted?

981
01:32:50.566 --> 01:32:53.360
Recruit the beasts that share our god.

982
01:32:55.321 --> 01:32:57.113
Animals?

983
01:32:57.281 --> 01:33:00.533
From the North.
You mean Celts.

984
01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:03.161
They drink the blood of their dead.

985
01:33:03.329 --> 01:33:05.830
Yoke their strength.

986
01:33:08.251 --> 01:33:11.044
Hired thugs.

987
01:33:14.048 --> 01:33:16.174
Brilliant.

988
01:33:20.221 --> 01:33:23.473
Put thine own issue on the throne.

989
01:33:24.725 --> 01:33:26.434
A child? How?

990
01:33:26.727 --> 01:33:28.979
Ally with royal blood.

991
01:33:30.481 --> 01:33:32.357
Who?

992
01:33:46.998 --> 01:33:50.250
It's a personal matter, my lord.
But one of vital importance.

993
01:33:50.418 --> 01:33:53.044
I understand, my dear lady.

994
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:56.047
This is my most trusted emissary.

995
01:33:56.215 --> 01:34:00.719
You must travel to France immediately and
put that directly in the hands of the king.

996
01:34:00.886 --> 01:34:03.221
My lady in waiting shall accompany you.

997
01:34:03.389 --> 01:34:07.559
My dear, I could not vouch
for her safety.

998
01:34:07.727 --> 01:34:09.644
The journey is fraught with danger.

999
01:34:10.021 --> 01:34:11.354
I appreciate your concern...

1000
01:34:11.522 --> 01:34:14.733
but Sarah's an accomplished rider,
and I insist she go along.

1001
01:34:16.027 --> 01:34:17.736
As you wish.

1002
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:33.043
What is wrong?

1003
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:36.338
My horse is favoring his foreleg.

1004
01:35:25.638 --> 01:35:26.679
What's this?

1005
01:35:29.725 --> 01:35:34.229
An appetizer.
You promised us wagons of gold.

1006
01:35:35.731 --> 01:35:39.150
Well, there are greater things than gold.

1007
01:35:39.318 --> 01:35:43.905
More land and power
than you have ever dreamed of.

1008
01:35:45.157 --> 01:35:47.200
When I rule this land...

1009
01:35:47.368 --> 01:35:50.870
it'll be divided between
just the seven of us in this room.

1010
01:35:51.038 --> 01:35:53.706
You get Cornwall,
you can have Wales...

1011
01:35:53.874 --> 01:35:56.000
and Scotland is all yours.

1012
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:59.421
You recruit us to treason...

1013
01:35:59.588 --> 01:36:02.632
and yet you cannot even get gold
through your own forest.

1014
01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:08.721
Why risk life and limb for a man who cannot
even snare the bandit who marked his face?

1015
01:36:08.889 --> 01:36:11.141
Why, indeed?

1016
01:36:12.017 --> 01:36:13.935
That's a good point, my lord.

1017
01:36:14.103 --> 01:36:19.149
How can I control England
when I cannot even control my own county?

1018
01:36:20.526 --> 01:36:23.445
I'm bringing in a little help.

1019
01:36:24.071 --> 01:36:25.947
Audred!

1020
01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.954
By God.

1021
01:36:33.122 --> 01:36:35.874
You'd ally us with the Celts?

1022
01:36:36.041 --> 01:36:39.085
What can these mercenaries do
that we cannot?

1023
01:37:09.825 --> 01:37:11.993
Very impressive.

1024
01:37:12.161 --> 01:37:14.412
All right, my lord sheriff...

1025
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.958
but you must wed royal kin
before we act.

1026
01:37:19.126 --> 01:37:21.794
Then your claim to the throne
will be...

1027
01:37:23.923 --> 01:37:25.590
legitimate.

1028
01:37:25.758 --> 01:37:28.635
I'm as good as engaged.

1029
01:37:49.657 --> 01:37:51.950
Duncan, is that you?

1030
01:37:55.955 --> 01:37:57.539
Hello?

1031
01:38:01.835 --> 01:38:03.545
Rebecca?

1032
01:38:06.507 --> 01:38:08.341
Ah! God!

1033
01:38:08.884 --> 01:38:11.094
Nicodemus. Go.

1034
01:38:11.262 --> 01:38:12.512
Find mice.

1035
01:38:16.642 --> 01:38:20.019
I've never seen the breasts
of a noblewoman.

1036
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:36.160
Pardon, my lady, we couldn't hold them!
Someone wants a word with you.

1037
01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:44.836
No!
That's it, sir. That's all of them.

1038
01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:02.854
Easy.

1039
01:39:06.984 --> 01:39:10.361
Tonight I need your eyes, old friend.

1040
01:39:55.783 --> 01:39:59.494
Robin! The warning arrow!

1041
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:04.666
All is well! It's Duncan!

1042
01:40:07.086 --> 01:40:10.004
Duncan. Duncan.

1043
01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:14.926
What happened?

1044
01:40:15.094 --> 01:40:17.595
I found you, Robin.
Thank God, I did it.

1045
01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:21.516
Nottingham's men attacked us.
Marian?

1046
01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.851
They took her.

1047
01:40:32.778 --> 01:40:34.362
What is it?

1048
01:40:35.572 --> 01:40:37.782
Over there! Look!

1049
01:40:38.325 --> 01:40:40.159
On the hill!

1050
01:41:00.973 --> 01:41:02.598
Celts! God help us!

1051
01:41:02.766 --> 01:41:04.642
Allah, be merciful.

1052
01:41:05.144 --> 01:41:08.646
To the trees!
To the trees!

1053
01:41:09.898 --> 01:41:11.899
Celts! They're coming!

1054
01:41:12.067 --> 01:41:15.027
Poor old fool led them straight to us.

1055
01:41:16.739 --> 01:41:18.406
Hide in the trees!

1056
01:41:19.867 --> 01:41:21.659
Get me prisoners.

1057
01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:37.008
Children! Come to me!

1058
01:41:54.735 --> 01:41:56.611
Daddy!

1059
01:43:52.728 --> 01:43:54.145
My God.

1060
01:44:07.784 --> 01:44:09.201
Save us!

1061
01:44:22.507 --> 01:44:24.383
Come! Hurry!

1062
01:44:25.886 --> 01:44:27.678
Save yourselves!

1063
01:44:31.558 --> 01:44:34.101
We've gotta go, Robin!
We go now!

1064
01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:39.607
Move!

1065
01:44:50.369 --> 01:44:52.995
This way, my lambs.
Come on!

1066
01:44:56.375 --> 01:44:58.167
Got you!
Hold or I fire!

1067
01:45:02.547 --> 01:45:04.882
It's gold! Gold!

1068
01:45:09.721 --> 01:45:11.430
Fanny!

1069
01:45:13.725 --> 01:45:15.643
Fanny!

1070
01:45:18.313 --> 01:45:20.439
John!
Come on, girl!

1071
01:45:45.882 --> 01:45:47.883
Fanny!

1072
01:45:48.051 --> 01:45:50.094
Go! Save yourself, John!

1073
01:45:50.262 --> 01:45:53.264
No, Fanny, I won't leave you!

1074
01:45:53.598 --> 01:45:55.516
Go on, John!

1075
01:45:55.767 --> 01:45:57.893
Never!

1076
01:45:59.271 --> 01:46:00.521
Oh, God!

1077
01:46:11.616 --> 01:46:13.200
Okay.
Oh, thank God.

1078
01:46:16.538 --> 01:46:19.498
John, you'll have to catch her!
Come on!

1079
01:46:27.632 --> 01:46:29.550
I got you, girl!

1080
01:46:36.475 --> 01:46:39.060
Quick! Quick!
Robin!

1081
01:46:47.652 --> 01:46:49.195
Come on!
Come on!

1082
01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:54.825
Get over here!
Go on!

1083
01:46:55.243 --> 01:46:57.036
Come on!

1084
01:46:57.412 --> 01:47:00.831
Don't wait for me!
John, go on!

1085
01:47:00.999 --> 01:47:02.500
Hurry!

1086
01:47:29.903 --> 01:47:31.737
Corpus Christi.

1087
01:47:31.905 --> 01:47:33.364
Amen.

1088
01:47:51.133 --> 01:47:53.050
My Lady Marian.

1089
01:47:54.636 --> 01:47:57.805
By what right do you keep me prisoner?

1090
01:47:57.973 --> 01:48:01.016
You misunderstand my intentions.

1091
01:48:01.184 --> 01:48:03.519
You've been brought here
for your own protection.

1092
01:48:05.647 --> 01:48:09.525
Protection from whom?
From yourself.

1093
01:48:10.235 --> 01:48:13.946
It seems that you've been
consorting with outlaws.

1094
01:48:16.158 --> 01:48:18.868
Where do you hear such lies?

1095
01:48:19.661 --> 01:48:22.329
By your own hand, my lady.

1096
01:48:27.586 --> 01:48:29.920
I'm sorry, my child.

1097
01:48:30.922 --> 01:48:33.799
I feared you were being led astray.

1098
01:48:36.595 --> 01:48:38.179
Come.

1099
01:48:47.063 --> 01:48:49.190
It's over.

1100
01:48:49.691 --> 01:48:53.527
Today I return justice to this land.

1101
01:48:54.779 --> 01:48:59.074
I shall have to hang the ringleaders, of
course, but I would like to be generous...

1102
01:48:59.242 --> 01:49:03.454
and give you the lives of the woodsmen
and their families.

1103
01:49:04.122 --> 01:49:05.664
The children!

1104
01:49:06.958 --> 01:49:08.459
And, of course...

1105
01:49:08.627 --> 01:49:12.379
of your traitorous lady in waiting.
Get in there!

1106
01:49:14.216 --> 01:49:16.926
As a wedding gift.

1107
01:49:21.139 --> 01:49:25.142
And just who am I supposed to marry?

1108
01:49:30.315 --> 01:49:33.609
Search your heart, my child.

1109
01:49:33.777 --> 01:49:37.071
Why not a union
with the house of Nottingham...

1110
01:49:37.239 --> 01:49:39.698
and heal the wounds in our land?

1111
01:49:39.866 --> 01:49:43.077
There is only one man who can heal
the wounds of this land.

1112
01:49:43.245 --> 01:49:45.079
Robin Hood.

1113
01:49:57.842 --> 01:49:59.760
I'm truly sorry, my lady.

1114
01:49:59.928 --> 01:50:03.889
He wasted his life.
How many more lives would you waste?

1115
01:50:14.734 --> 01:50:16.944
What a beautiful child.

1116
01:50:20.699 --> 01:50:22.825
So young.

1117
01:50:22.993 --> 01:50:29.206
So alive, so unaware
of how precarious life can be.

1118
01:50:35.338 --> 01:50:38.799
I had a very sad childhood.
I'll tell you about it sometime.

1119
01:50:38.967 --> 01:50:43.345
I never knew my parents.
It's amazing I'm sane.

1120
01:50:52.564 --> 01:50:56.692
Our bonding would allow these children
to grow up as my allies.

1121
01:50:57.235 --> 01:50:59.111
You understand...

1122
01:50:59.279 --> 01:51:04.074
I cannot allow them
to grow up as my enemies.

1123
01:51:06.369 --> 01:51:08.662
I have no choice.

1124
01:51:10.081 --> 01:51:12.082
That's true.

1125
01:51:51.748 --> 01:51:53.374
Look!

1126
01:51:58.546 --> 01:52:00.464
Christian.

1127
01:52:25.031 --> 01:52:26.698
Leave him be!

1128
01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:37.501
Sorry to keep you hanging about.

1129
01:52:41.881 --> 01:52:46.176
Would you prefer pain or death?

1130
01:52:47.345 --> 01:52:48.971
Death.

1131
01:52:49.139 --> 01:52:51.181
Torture him.

1132
01:52:52.267 --> 01:52:56.145
What about you?
Pain or death?

1133
01:52:56.312 --> 01:52:57.855
Pain.

1134
01:52:58.022 --> 01:53:00.441
Torture him. You see?

1135
01:53:00.608 --> 01:53:03.610
It makes no difference.
Spare me.

1136
01:53:05.363 --> 01:53:09.491
Will you keep the noise down, please?!

1137
01:53:09.659 --> 01:53:15.164
Now, I have heard that Robin Hood
may still be alive.

1138
01:53:16.207 --> 01:53:20.043
Either tell me where he may be hiding...

1139
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:23.755
or you'll all be hanged, and we'll
catch him anyway and do the same to him.

1140
01:53:23.923 --> 01:53:26.383
I'd love to kill him for you.
Will, no!

1141
01:53:30.555 --> 01:53:33.474
So he is alive, then?

1142
01:53:33.641 --> 01:53:35.601
I'm not really sure.

1143
01:53:35.768 --> 01:53:38.729
Then why would I need you?

1144
01:53:39.564 --> 01:53:43.650
Because, my lord, if he is alive
I can get close to him.

1145
01:53:43.818 --> 01:53:46.361
I'm one of his men.
He would never suspect me.

1146
01:53:46.529 --> 01:53:49.114
He knows you always hated him, traitor!
Shut up!

1147
01:53:50.074 --> 01:53:53.577
He's a trusting fool. And if he doesn't
believe me, he'll kill me...

1148
01:53:53.745 --> 01:53:56.246
then you've lost nothing.

1149
01:53:58.082 --> 01:54:00.626
If you fail...

1150
01:54:01.336 --> 01:54:05.756
I will personally remove
your lying tongue.

1151
01:54:08.009 --> 01:54:10.427
And if I succeed...

1152
01:54:10.595 --> 01:54:14.348
I want my freedom
and the bounty on his head.

1153
01:54:14.516 --> 01:54:16.767
The lash, I think.

1154
01:54:16.935 --> 01:54:20.103
Sorry about that.
It'll make it more convincing.

1155
01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:56.848
My pride brought us to this.
No, Sadiq.

1156
01:54:57.767 --> 01:55:01.103
It was you who gave pride
to these people.

1157
01:55:02.939 --> 01:55:04.815
I was a fool.

1158
01:55:06.317 --> 01:55:08.819
I was a fool to let him leave...

1159
01:55:09.404 --> 01:55:12.573
to believe I planned
it all so perfectly.

1160
01:55:15.660 --> 01:55:18.161
I once heard a wise man say:

1161
01:55:19.414 --> 01:55:22.666
There are no perfect men
in this world...

1162
01:55:23.543 --> 01:55:25.127
only perfect intentions.

1163
01:55:30.925 --> 01:55:33.760
You were an honor
to your countrymen today, Azeem.

1164
01:55:36.347 --> 01:55:39.266
You fought better
than 20 English knights.

1165
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:10.297
Will!

1166
01:56:11.257 --> 01:56:14.509
I thought you were taken.
I was.

1167
01:56:14.677 --> 01:56:16.386
How did you escape?

1168
01:56:16.554 --> 01:56:18.096
Traitor!

1169
01:56:18.264 --> 01:56:20.682
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1170
01:56:20.850 --> 01:56:22.309
You get in there!
Get in there!

1171
01:56:22.477 --> 01:56:26.521
Nobody escapes the sheriff,
not unless he's lining his pockets.

1172
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:28.607
Where are the others?

1173
01:56:28.775 --> 01:56:31.360
Where's my son?!
He'll have his blade in your side!

1174
01:56:31.527 --> 01:56:34.821
I'll have your guts for garters,
you little toad!

1175
01:56:38.951 --> 01:56:40.911
Bugger me!
God!

1176
01:56:41.412 --> 01:56:43.246
Let him speak.

1177
01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:47.918
I bring a message...

1178
01:56:48.878 --> 01:56:50.921
from Nottingham.

1179
01:56:51.422 --> 01:56:54.466
Our men are to be hung
in the square at high noon tomorrow.

1180
01:56:54.634 --> 01:56:56.843
And what about my boy?

1181
01:56:57.011 --> 01:56:59.554
The boy too. Ten men in all.

1182
01:57:01.015 --> 01:57:05.852
The hangings are to be part of the
celebration for the sheriff's marriage.

1183
01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:08.355
Marriage? To who?

1184
01:57:09.691 --> 01:57:11.692
Lady Marian.

1185
01:57:11.859 --> 01:57:14.444
He takes a bride of royal blood.

1186
01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:18.156
And with King Richard gone...

1187
01:57:18.324 --> 01:57:20.826
he'll be after the bloody throne.

1188
01:57:21.369 --> 01:57:25.789
You were to use this news to get
close to me and then kill me, right, Will?

1189
01:57:28.126 --> 01:57:32.379
What are your intentions?
That depends on you, Locksley.

1190
01:57:33.548 --> 01:57:36.508
I've never trusted you,
that's no secret.

1191
01:57:36.676 --> 01:57:39.136
What I wanna know is,
are you gonna finish what you started?

1192
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:43.890
I want to know if he's gonna run like
the spoiled rich boy I always took him for.

1193
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:50.147
Did I wrong you in another life,
Will Scarlett?

1194
01:57:51.149 --> 01:57:54.860
Where does this intolerable hatred for me
come from?

1195
01:58:06.205 --> 01:58:07.914
From knowing...

1196
01:58:08.082 --> 01:58:11.334
that our father loved you
more than me.

1197
01:58:13.379 --> 01:58:15.213
Our father?

1198
01:58:15.381 --> 01:58:17.924
We are brothers, Robin of Locksley.

1199
01:58:18.092 --> 01:58:22.763
I am the son of the woman who replaced
your dead mother for a time!

1200
01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:25.015
Your anger drove them apart!
It's a lie!

1201
01:58:25.183 --> 01:58:28.435
It's not a lie!
You ruined my life!

1202
01:58:41.032 --> 01:58:45.118
I have more reason to hate you
than anyone.

1203
01:58:45.286 --> 01:58:48.747
But I found myself daring
to believe in you.

1204
01:58:49.457 --> 01:58:51.041
What I wanna know, brother...

1205
01:58:51.626 --> 01:58:55.295
is will you stay with us
and finish what you've started?

1206
01:59:00.593 --> 01:59:02.928
I have a brother?

1207
01:59:06.265 --> 01:59:08.433
I have a brother.

1208
01:59:11.938 --> 01:59:14.356
I will make my stand with you.

1209
01:59:14.524 --> 01:59:16.650
Side by side.

1210
01:59:16.818 --> 01:59:18.401
To the end.

1211
01:59:20.988 --> 01:59:23.073
To the end!

1212
01:59:24.909 --> 01:59:27.077
We're all bloody in.

1213
01:59:27.245 --> 01:59:28.703
Daft buggers.

1214
01:59:33.209 --> 01:59:34.668
We finish this.

1215
02:00:02.613 --> 02:00:06.157
Overwhelmed with happiness,
thank you for asking.

1216
02:00:06.325 --> 02:00:09.411
Yes, all is well.
I got all my money back...

1217
02:00:09.579 --> 02:00:15.292
Robin Hood's probably dead,
and I'm gonna be king, all as predicted.

1218
02:00:19.505 --> 02:00:21.298
Now, I want you to tell the hangman...

1219
02:00:21.465 --> 02:00:24.676
I don't want to see
any broken necks in the morning.

1220
02:00:24.844 --> 02:00:29.347
I wanna see some dancing!

1221
02:00:30.725 --> 02:00:33.894
Don't touch that!

1222
02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:37.230
I can do that myself.

1223
02:00:38.524 --> 02:00:42.152
Thank you very much.

1224
02:01:24.695 --> 02:01:27.447
Have you been spying on me,
you little insect?

1225
02:01:31.202 --> 02:01:35.038
Well, who else would have made a...?

1226
02:01:53.057 --> 02:01:55.517
Where are you?

1227
02:02:00.731 --> 02:02:03.358
You come early.
The signs have not aligned yet.

1228
02:02:03.776 --> 02:02:06.778
And you can stop all that,
you old fake!

1229
02:02:07.655 --> 02:02:10.407
I will try for thee anyway.

1230
02:02:15.413 --> 02:02:19.124
The union. The blood of the lion
and the house of Nottingham...

1231
02:02:19.291 --> 02:02:21.418
new power, new soul.

1232
02:02:21.585 --> 02:02:24.337
I found the hole!

1233
02:02:24.505 --> 02:02:27.674
You dare to spy on me?

1234
02:02:27.842 --> 02:02:30.760
I want the truth.

1235
02:02:32.013 --> 02:02:33.596
Why?

1236
02:02:33.764 --> 02:02:36.891
Truth has never served you before.

1237
02:02:37.059 --> 02:02:41.271
Truth didn't put Nottingham
where he is today.

1238
02:02:41.439 --> 02:02:42.439
Mortianna did.

1239
02:02:42.606 --> 02:02:46.443
You freakish imp, I despise you.

1240
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:48.486
After the wedding,
you're on the streets.

1241
02:02:48.654 --> 02:02:51.072
The people will rip out
your heart and burn it!

1242
02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:54.868
Without me, you're nothing.

1243
02:02:56.287 --> 02:03:00.040
You're straw. A fleabite.
A speck.

1244
02:03:02.168 --> 02:03:05.003
I birthed you from this body.

1245
02:03:05.171 --> 02:03:07.964
I stole a babe in this very castle
and killed it...

1246
02:03:08.132 --> 02:03:12.135
so that you might rise in its place.

1247
02:03:13.929 --> 02:03:16.097
You're my son.

1248
02:03:19.393 --> 02:03:21.811
You despise me?

1249
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:25.815
You are me.

1250
02:03:25.983 --> 02:03:28.693
You know, from your empty soul,
that is the truth.

1251
02:03:30.362 --> 02:03:35.283
All my life, I've been a freak.

1252
02:03:35.451 --> 02:03:39.162
But when you stud the Lady Marian...

1253
02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:42.957
my grandchild takes the throne.
My blood.

1254
02:03:43.125 --> 02:03:48.213
This twisted seed will rule through him.

1255
02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:51.841
We'll see who's freakish then.

1256
02:04:26.627 --> 02:04:29.212
Damn!
What was that?

1257
02:04:29.964 --> 02:04:32.048
Truly, you are a wizard.

1258
02:04:32.216 --> 02:04:34.843
The mystery is in the black powder.

1259
02:04:35.010 --> 02:04:37.720
Surely the Lord will grant us victory.

1260
02:04:39.098 --> 02:04:40.557
Bull?
Yeah.

1261
02:04:40.724 --> 02:04:43.434
Position by the gate
to cut off reinforcements.

1262
02:04:43.602 --> 02:04:46.729
John, you sit on this wall
to protect our escape.

1263
02:04:46.897 --> 02:04:49.649
I will conceal myself here,
below the scaffold...

1264
02:04:49.817 --> 02:04:52.944
to cut our men from their nooses
at the signal.

1265
02:04:53.112 --> 02:04:55.446
I'll do that. You have to cover us
with your bow.

1266
02:04:55.614 --> 02:04:57.407
It's too dangerous, Will.

1267
02:04:57.575 --> 02:04:59.284
So is your aim.

1268
02:05:01.912 --> 02:05:04.914
Whatever Azeem is concocting,
we must each be in place for it.

1269
02:05:05.082 --> 02:05:08.293
Now, our success depends
on total concert.

1270
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:11.379
We may be only six men...
Seven.

1271
02:05:11.547 --> 02:05:13.548
What are you doing?
Where's the little ones?

1272
02:05:13.716 --> 02:05:15.425
Safe with my mother.

1273
02:05:15.593 --> 02:05:17.760
You gone bleeding cracked?
You'd get hurt.

1274
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:21.181
I've had eight babies.
Don't talk to me about getting hurt.

1275
02:05:21.348 --> 02:05:24.350
I'm not just gonna sit here
and let one of them die.

1276
02:05:24.518 --> 02:05:27.937
You should be bloody well minding
the other seven.

1277
02:05:28.105 --> 02:05:30.023
Tell her, Rob.

1278
02:05:33.986 --> 02:05:35.778
Fanny...

1279
02:05:35.946 --> 02:05:38.531
you will take position here.

1280
02:05:51.462 --> 02:05:59.462
No blades, no bows.
Leave your weapons here.

1281
02:06:00.304 --> 02:06:03.765
No blades, no bows.
No blades.

1282
02:06:04.391 --> 02:06:06.309
What have you got there, Father?

1283
02:06:06.477 --> 02:06:10.730
The Lord's finest brew
for the good sheriff's fighting men.

1284
02:06:10.898 --> 02:06:13.483
It has a mighty kick.

1285
02:06:17.154 --> 02:06:19.405
No blades, no bows.

1286
02:06:30.876 --> 02:06:33.419
Don't anger him.
He is a Celt.

1287
02:06:37.841 --> 02:06:41.511
Psst. John. John!

1288
02:07:14.086 --> 02:07:15.670
Hey, you.

1289
02:07:16.714 --> 02:07:20.008
Do I know you?
Please, sir, don't hurt me.

1290
02:07:20.175 --> 02:07:22.051
Oh, my God, you stink.

1291
02:07:22.219 --> 02:07:26.889
Pardon my blindness. I'm always falling...
Get out of here!

1292
02:07:27.516 --> 02:07:31.394
Thank you, sir.
Careful, friar.

1293
02:07:33.772 --> 02:07:35.398
What are you doing?

1294
02:07:35.566 --> 02:07:39.986
Distributing libations for the celebration
of the sheriff's nuptials.

1295
02:07:40.154 --> 02:07:43.740
Why, is something amiss?
Yeah, you are. Get this out of here!

1296
02:07:43.907 --> 02:07:48.077
Caesar has spoken, my leprous friend.
We shall collect our offerings and depart.

1297
02:07:48.245 --> 02:07:52.582
Is this your finger?
Leper, what? Get this cart out of here!

1298
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:56.502
Leaving bits and pieces of himself
all over England.

1299
02:08:04.595 --> 02:08:06.346
What are you doing here?

1300
02:08:06.513 --> 02:08:09.515
I ain't doing no harm.
I likes a good hanging, I do.

1301
02:08:09.683 --> 02:08:13.227
What's in this bundle?
That's firewood.

1302
02:08:17.608 --> 02:08:18.941
Hello, my lover.

1303
02:08:26.116 --> 02:08:29.285
Make way for the Lord's work!
Make way, do you hear?

1304
02:08:29.453 --> 02:08:30.787
Make way for the Lord's work!

1305
02:08:30.954 --> 02:08:34.624
A benediction for these poor bastards
who are about to stretch.

1306
02:08:35.292 --> 02:08:37.668
God, receive them in thy mercy...

1307
02:08:37.836 --> 02:08:41.547
and show them the love
that they do so richly deserve.

1308
02:08:43.842 --> 02:08:47.136
Hey! Nothing there but trouble, boy.

1309
02:09:06.824 --> 02:09:10.284
That's a little inappropriate,
don't you think?

1310
02:09:11.245 --> 02:09:14.288
No more than your wedding present.

1311
02:09:17.584 --> 02:09:19.502
Bring them out!

1312
02:09:30.472 --> 02:09:32.932
Get your hands off me, you dog.

1313
02:09:53.162 --> 02:09:58.040
And suffer knowing the lord
and his ministers are watching over you.

1314
02:10:41.001 --> 02:10:42.710
Make way!

1315
02:10:55.057 --> 02:10:56.933
Traitor! Traitor!

1316
02:11:06.318 --> 02:11:08.319
What's going on?

1317
02:11:10.364 --> 02:11:11.822
Bring him here!

1318
02:11:13.283 --> 02:11:15.910
I'll kill you!
What do I do?

1319
02:11:24.378 --> 02:11:26.796
Oh, the turncoat.

1320
02:11:26.964 --> 02:11:28.923
Did you succeed?

1321
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:32.468
Well, I found his lair...

1322
02:11:34.012 --> 02:11:36.097
but he was already dead.

1323
02:11:36.265 --> 02:11:39.475
You sure?
You saw Hood's body?

1324
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:42.103
No.

1325
02:11:42.271 --> 02:11:44.814
I saw a grave.

1326
02:11:45.148 --> 02:11:47.233
We found this on him.

1327
02:11:51.154 --> 02:11:53.406
String him up with the others.

1328
02:11:57.578 --> 02:11:59.161
Put me down! Let go!

1329
02:12:03.667 --> 02:12:04.667
Let me go!

1330
02:12:09.756 --> 02:12:12.466
Leave him! He's only a boy.
Shut up!

1331
02:12:13.468 --> 02:12:16.762
Bastard!
You all right?

1332
02:12:17.681 --> 02:12:19.348
Now, Robin?

1333
02:12:34.656 --> 02:12:37.825
My lord, it appears there's no more room!

1334
02:12:38.368 --> 02:12:41.996
I'm afraid I'll have to respectfully
decline! Come on, you. Down!

1335
02:12:43.123 --> 02:12:44.165
Down.

1336
02:12:46.752 --> 02:12:49.128
Come on, move it. Hold your tongue!

1337
02:12:51.882 --> 02:12:55.134
There's always room for one more.

1338
02:13:28.543 --> 02:13:30.252
No!
That's my son!

1339
02:13:31.672 --> 02:13:33.506
I'm coming, Wulf!

1340
02:13:33.674 --> 02:13:35.174
My boy!

1341
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:10.459
Locksley.
Robin!

1342
02:14:41.366 --> 02:14:43.993
Get some troops in here!

1343
02:14:53.503 --> 02:14:56.172
What are you waiting for?
Get on with it!

1344
02:15:08.268 --> 02:15:09.560
Help!

1345
02:15:45.639 --> 02:15:47.890
Wulf!
Father!

1346
02:15:49.059 --> 02:15:50.226
Oh, thank God.

1347
02:15:52.479 --> 02:15:55.231
Come on, you milksops!

1348
02:15:55.398 --> 02:15:57.691
Fight your way free.
Look out!

1349
02:16:04.699 --> 02:16:06.200
This way! To the wall!

1350
02:16:06.701 --> 02:16:10.746
My lord sheriff,
is this your idea of control?!

1351
02:16:12.249 --> 02:16:14.416
Shut up, you twit.

1352
02:16:14.751 --> 02:16:17.169
Come with me.
Robin!

1353
02:16:19.506 --> 02:16:20.506
Marian.

1354
02:16:21.591 --> 02:16:23.342
Marian!

1355
02:16:23.969 --> 02:16:25.845
English!

1356
02:16:26.012 --> 02:16:27.596
English!

1357
02:16:27.931 --> 02:16:31.934
Behold Azeem Edin Bashir Al Bakir!

1358
02:16:32.102 --> 02:16:34.270
I am not one of you...

1359
02:16:34.437 --> 02:16:36.272
but I fight!

1360
02:16:36.439 --> 02:16:39.233
I fight with Robin Hood!

1361
02:16:39.401 --> 02:16:42.945
I fight against a tyrant
who holds you under his boot!

1362
02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:45.656
If you would be free men...

1363
02:16:45.824 --> 02:16:50.286
then you must fight!
Join us now!

1364
02:16:51.121 --> 02:16:53.622
Join Robin Hood!
Freedom!

1365
02:16:58.837 --> 02:17:00.045
Come on!

1366
02:17:18.481 --> 02:17:22.192
Marian!
Oh! Robin!

1367
02:17:28.158 --> 02:17:29.825
John!

1368
02:17:31.661 --> 02:17:34.163
Close the gate!
No!

1369
02:17:34.331 --> 02:17:36.498
Guard it with your life!

1370
02:17:36.666 --> 02:17:39.418
Bring the bishop to my chapel!

1371
02:17:41.254 --> 02:17:42.713
Right there.

1372
02:17:43.965 --> 02:17:46.175
That's good, John. That's good.

1373
02:17:50.221 --> 02:17:52.056
Is she worth it?

1374
02:17:52.223 --> 02:17:54.308
Worth dying for?

1375
02:17:59.606 --> 02:18:01.148
Will!

1376
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:12.117
Fuck me, he cleared it!

1377
02:18:16.915 --> 02:18:18.707
Marian!

1378
02:18:45.402 --> 02:18:47.736
We're doomed.

1379
02:18:52.283 --> 02:18:56.370
'Tis rebellion, my lord. We must escape.
Marry us!

1380
02:18:56.997 --> 02:18:59.415
I will never marry you!

1381
02:19:01.626 --> 02:19:04.753
That's my wife, crone!

1382
02:19:05.672 --> 02:19:07.256
Get away!

1383
02:19:07.424 --> 02:19:10.384
She's ripe. She will give us a son.

1384
02:19:10.552 --> 02:19:12.219
You must take her now.

1385
02:19:12.387 --> 02:19:17.266
I will not take her
until we are properly wed!

1386
02:19:17.642 --> 02:19:22.938
For once in my life, I will have
something pure! Will you stop interfering?

1387
02:19:23.106 --> 02:19:25.607
'Tis madness to delay.

1388
02:19:27.444 --> 02:19:30.404
Marry them or face me!

1389
02:19:40.623 --> 02:19:41.623
Marian!

1390
02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:53.677
Where is she?

1391
02:19:57.807 --> 02:20:01.560
The Lady Marian?
Up the stairs, that way!

1392
02:20:04.647 --> 02:20:06.482
Marian?

1393
02:20:07.776 --> 02:20:09.485
Marian!

1394
02:20:09.819 --> 02:20:11.111
Robin!

1395
02:20:11.279 --> 02:20:14.323
Get on with it!
Robin!

1396
02:20:17.911 --> 02:20:19.453
Statue.

1397
02:20:21.331 --> 02:20:24.833
Do you, George,
Sheriff of Nottingham...

1398
02:20:25.001 --> 02:20:26.960
take this woman to be your wife?

1399
02:20:35.678 --> 02:20:36.678
To have and to hold...

1400
02:20:38.264 --> 02:20:41.517
in sickness and in health,
for better or worse, richer...

1401
02:20:41.684 --> 02:20:44.686
Yes, yes! Come on!
Make haste!

1402
02:20:44.854 --> 02:20:50.317
And do you, Marian of the house of Dubois,
take this man to be your husband?

1403
02:20:50.485 --> 02:20:52.694
Yes, of course she does.

1404
02:20:58.159 --> 02:20:59.535
Marian!

1405
02:20:59.702 --> 02:21:01.286
Damned English oak!

1406
02:21:01.454 --> 02:21:03.539
Robin! Robin!
Marian!

1407
02:21:03.706 --> 02:21:05.541
I'll try another way.

1408
02:21:17.512 --> 02:21:19.138
What do you want?

1409
02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:27.312
I can't do this with all that racket!

1410
02:21:30.191 --> 02:21:33.485
How could you?
How could you?

1411
02:21:49.377 --> 02:21:52.212
The painted man!
The witch!

1412
02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:56.175
I didn't know. I didn't know it was you.
Please, sire, have pity.

1413
02:21:56.342 --> 02:21:59.094
Don't harm an old woman.

1414
02:22:17.614 --> 02:22:22.451
You may take this body, but it will not
be me! It will not be me!

1415
02:22:23.286 --> 02:22:25.245
Not again!

1416
02:22:26.623 --> 02:22:30.125
I now pronounce you man and wife,
in the name of the Father...

1417
02:22:30.293 --> 02:22:33.462
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1418
02:22:41.471 --> 02:22:43.263
Robin.

1419
02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:49.144
Do you mind, Locksley?

1420
02:22:50.146 --> 02:22:52.814
We've just been married.

1421
02:23:04.661 --> 02:23:06.703
Recognize this?

1422
02:23:08.498 --> 02:23:11.500
It belonged to your father.

1423
02:23:12.043 --> 02:23:16.296
Appropriate, don't you think,
that I now use it to send you to meet him?

1424
02:23:18.299 --> 02:23:21.218
I shall never fear my father's sword.

1425
02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:23.303
Really?

1426
02:23:26.683 --> 02:23:28.892
Now we're even.

1427
02:23:41.114 --> 02:23:42.364
Robin!

1428
02:23:58.464 --> 02:24:01.967
If I must, I will take you
a piece at a time.

1429
02:24:05.138 --> 02:24:07.139
I'll do the only taking today.

1430
02:24:19.152 --> 02:24:22.321
You sold your soul to Satan, your grace.

1431
02:24:23.781 --> 02:24:28.618
You accused innocent men of witchcraft
and let them die.

1432
02:24:28.786 --> 02:24:34.541
Brother friar, you would not strike
a fellow man of the cloth.

1433
02:24:34.709 --> 02:24:37.711
No. No, I wouldn't.

1434
02:24:37.879 --> 02:24:41.214
In fact, I'll help you pack
for your journey.

1435
02:24:41.382 --> 02:24:44.593
You're going to need lots of gold
to help you on your way.

1436
02:24:44.761 --> 02:24:48.430
You're a very rich man.
This too.

1437
02:24:48.598 --> 02:24:50.390
Enough!

1438
02:24:50.558 --> 02:24:53.101
Here's 30 pieces of silver...

1439
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:56.271
to pay the devil on your way to hell!

1440
02:25:49.992 --> 02:25:51.660
Robin!

1441
02:26:04.632 --> 02:26:06.716
Get ready.

1442
02:26:07.093 --> 02:26:08.427
No!

1443
02:27:36.974 --> 02:27:39.392
I have fulfilled my vow, Sadiq.

1444
02:27:57.328 --> 02:27:59.538
You came for me.

1445
02:28:00.456 --> 02:28:02.707
You're alive.

1446
02:28:02.875 --> 02:28:05.293
I would die for you.

1447
02:28:13.219 --> 02:28:17.013
By the power vested in me
by God's holy church...

1448
02:28:17.181 --> 02:28:21.893
I say any man who has reason
why these two should not be joined...

1449
02:28:22.061 --> 02:28:24.271
let him speak now...

1450
02:28:24.438 --> 02:28:27.065
or forever hold his peace.

1451
02:28:30.570 --> 02:28:33.154
Then I now pronounce you...
Hold!

1452
02:28:33.322 --> 02:28:34.990
I speak.

1453
02:28:44.625 --> 02:28:47.794
Richard!
It's the king.

1454
02:28:56.721 --> 02:28:59.472
I will not allow this wedding to proceed.
My lord...

1455
02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:01.349
Unless...

1456
02:29:01.934 --> 02:29:04.185
I'm allowed to give the bride away.

1457
02:29:04.353 --> 02:29:06.771
You look radiant, cousin.

1458
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:11.985
We are deeply honored, Your Majesty.

1459
02:29:12.153 --> 02:29:15.488
It is I who am honored, Lord Locksley.

1460
02:29:15.656 --> 02:29:18.366
Thanks to you, I still have a throne.

1461
02:29:18.826 --> 02:29:20.660
Friar, proceed.

1462
02:29:28.169 --> 02:29:31.004
Husband and wife.

1463
02:29:32.173 --> 02:29:33.715
You may kiss the bride.

1464
02:29:33.883 --> 02:29:35.634
I know that.

1465
02:30:01.243 --> 02:30:02.994
Now, get out of it.

1466
02:30:03.162 --> 02:30:05.914
We waste good celebration time.
