(man groans)

199
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.709
Shouldn't have drink so much.

200
00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:32.993

(phone ringing)

205
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.198
Hello.

206
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.534
[Hotelier] <i>Mrs. Weingarten,</i>

207
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.134
<i>Were you planning on</i>
<i>checking out today?</i>

208
00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:16.571
Housekeeping needs to clean the
room for our next guest.

209
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:18.338
<i>What?</i>

210
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.407
<i>My flight.</i>

211
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.074
What time?

212
00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:22.442
When is your flight?

213
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.178
1:30.

214
00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:28.415
<i>Well, Mrs. Weingarten, it's one</i>
<i>o'clock right now.</i>

215
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.552
I'm afraid you're not
gonna make it.

216
00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:31.686
Jet lags rough.

217
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:33.353
Go ahead and take your time.

218
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:36.323
<i>I'll move the other guests to</i>
<i>another room in the meantime.</i>

219
00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:45.065
(siren wailing)
(horns honking)

220
00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:55.208
(Greta gasps)

221
00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:09.222
(sighing)

222
00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:19.266
(dramatic music plays)

223
00:18:28.643 --> 00:18:30.511
(elevator bell dings)

224
00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:38.820
(gentle music playing)

225
00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:46.259
Somebody robbed me.

226
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.228
Excuse me.

227
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:50.430
Somebody stole all of my money.

228
00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:52.466
Well, I'm sorry to hear that
Mrs. Weingarten.

229
00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:54.736
Somebody stole your belongings
from your hotel room?

230
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.571
Yes.

231
00:18:57.572 --> 00:18:59.172
Well, do you know who this
somebody could be?

232
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:00.842
Yes.

233
00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:05.046
Well, do you want me to
call the police?

234
00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:08.348
You should file a
detailed report, ASAP.

235
00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:11.686
Chances are slim, but you
should still file.

236
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.488
How much refund do I get back?

237
00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:17.457
You'll get $300 refund minus
the incidentals.

238
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.627
Did you take anything out
of the minibar?

239
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:21.896
No.

240
00:19:22.997 --> 00:19:25.165
Well, then you'll get
a $300 refund.

241
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.836
Is that enough to rent a
car to Las Vegas?

242
00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:30.237
Well, yes, maybe.

243
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.806
But how are you gonna rent a car

244
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.608
without a valid credit card?

245
00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:35.076
Everything in this
country works,

246
00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:37.578
if you have a valid credit card,
seemingly.

247
00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:41.082
May I offer you a call
on the house?

248
00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:42.482
It's right over there.

249
00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:44.686
Yes, thank you.

250
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:45.720
Sure.

253
00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:06.206
August?

255
00:20:42.777 --> 00:20:43.644

256
00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:44.444

260
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:57.658
Rough night at the tables?

261
00:20:58.926 --> 00:20:59.927
Are you okay?

262
00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:02.663
No.

263
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:06.266
You wanna get a bite to eat?

264
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.401
Yes.

265
00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.571
I'm Nick, by the way.

266
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.472
Greta.

267
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:15.009
I know the best place in
town for burgers.

268
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.047
It's up this way.

269
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:22.315
[August] This is a call from
Germany, Deutschland.

270

[Recording] At <i>the</i>
<i>Grand Palace--</i>

271
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.552

272

Hello.

273
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.024

275
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.395
No, no, no, no, no,
no tuna dragon.

276
00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.364
I don't need that, no, no.

277
00:21:37.865 --> 00:21:39.267
(horns honking)

278
00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:40.735
Shit.

279
00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:44.138
Hey Jackson, did you see that
blonde German girl anywhere?

280
00:21:44.172 --> 00:21:45.740
Her husband's looking for her.

281
00:21:45.773 --> 00:21:47.608
No sir, I haven't.

282
00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:48.810
<i>If you prefer some</i>

283
00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:50.011

292
00:22:03.858 --> 00:22:04.892
Sir?

293
00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:05.760
Yes, I'm still here.

294
00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:06.661
<i>Your wife</i>

295
00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:08.029
already left the
property, I'm sorry.

296
00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:09.764
Maybe you do need a massage.

297
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.699
Okay.

298
00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:12.733
To summarize,

299
00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:18.506
you sold your husband's Porsche
to pay for a plane ticket

300
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.609
to the United States to see
Willie Nelson's final concert.

301
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.245
That asshole last
night robbed you.

302
00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:25.246
You lost all your money

303
00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:27.682
and you can't call your husband

304
00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:30.483
because he's still furious
about the Porsche.

305
00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:33.955
Somehow, understandable.

306
00:22:35.723 --> 00:22:37.525
How much money do you have?

307
00:22:38.893 --> 00:22:39.894
300.

308
00:22:40.962 --> 00:22:44.966
300, all right, online bookings
is doable, hotel.

309
00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:48.102
Maybe I could rustle
you up a car.

310
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:50.037
Rustle you up?

311
00:22:50.838 --> 00:22:52.874
(chuckles)

312
00:22:52.907 --> 00:22:55.276
I have a friend who might
loan you his car,

313
00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:57.511
but it's still a
seven hour drive.

314
00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:00.014
Good. And...

315
00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.414
Check, please.

316
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.419
Look, if you want, you can stay
at my place tonight.

317
00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:09.857
I won't steal anything,
I promise.

318
00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:14.095
There is nothing left to steal.

320

Help yourself with
anything in the fridge.

323
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:32.479
You can just put your stuff on
the couch if you want,

361
00:27:16.003 --> 00:27:18.906
You can start without me,
I already, I already ate.

362
00:27:19.373 --> 00:27:20.374
Thank you.

What is it with you and Elvis?

366
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.332
My grandmother was a
fan when a...

367
00:27:46.535 --> 00:27:48.869
...she died, she left me
her collection.

368
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.172
Did you ever meet him?

369
00:27:51.205 --> 00:27:52.006
No.

370
00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:53.941
Nah, he died young.

371
00:27:53.974 --> 00:27:57.711
I was, I was, I was too young,
didn't get a chance.

(gentle music plays)

373
00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:02.950
Is that the reason you sing
in his costumes?

374
00:28:04.084 --> 00:28:05.119
No.

375
00:28:06.086 --> 00:28:07.388
I...

376
00:28:07.421 --> 00:28:09.223
I don't think so. I mean...

377
00:28:10.758 --> 00:28:11.959

382
00:28:23.638 --> 00:28:26.106

[Greta] And you really think
everything that happens,

519
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.012
happens for a reason?

520
00:38:31.045 --> 00:38:32.680
[Rebecca] That's right, Greta.

521
00:38:32.713 --> 00:38:34.615
[Greta] That I should
not feel guilty

522
00:38:34.649 --> 00:38:38.052
that I sold my
husband's car because,

523
00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:41.222
in a way it is something that
he can learn from?

524
00:38:41.255 --> 00:38:42.723
That's right, Greta.

525
00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:45.893
What can he learn from it?

526
00:38:47.962 --> 00:38:50.898
Well, he could learn to let
go of materialism

527
00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:52.033
and to forgive.

528
00:38:52.066 --> 00:38:54.302
And if he can't learn to
forgive you, to let go,

529
00:38:54.334 --> 00:38:56.904
well then he is caged
inside of himself,

530
00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:58.606

00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:53.493
[Greta] I should have at least
asked my husband

541
00:39:53.527 --> 00:39:55.563
before I sell his car.

542
00:39:55.596 --> 00:39:56.831
(Rebecca chuckles)

543
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:59.333
That would've been
pretty stupid.

544
00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:02.970
But if you raised your
children so religious,

545
00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:06.107
doesn't religion say you
should not steal?

546
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:09.210
That's right, Greta.

547
00:40:09.243 --> 00:40:10.443
David, why don't you begin

548
00:40:10.477 --> 00:40:12.647
with the first commandment
for Greta, please.

549
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.916
"I am the Lord, your God."

550
00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:17.685
"You shall worship no
other God but me."

551
00:40:18.886 --> 00:40:19.720
That's right.

552
00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:21.522
"You should honor your mother."

553
00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:23.391
"You should not commit murder."

554
00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:24.959
Except in times of war.

555
00:40:25.793 --> 00:40:27.595
"You should not
commit adultery."

556
00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:29.030
Except in times of war.

557
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.198
You should not...

558
00:40:31.232 --> 00:40:33.200
You should not steal or lie.

559
00:40:33.234 --> 00:40:35.136
Except in times of war.

560
00:40:35.169 --> 00:40:37.038
You should not covet your
neighbor's housekeeper,

561
00:40:37.071 --> 00:40:40.942
gardener, car or anything else
your neighbor possesses.

562
00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:42.877
- Except in times of war.
- Except in times of war.

563
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.345
- In times of war.
- In times of war.

564
00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.212
- War.
- War.

565
00:40:45.246 --> 00:40:46.446
Amen.

566
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:53.254
[Greta] Lucky, we don't live
in times of war.

567
00:40:53.287 --> 00:40:54.522
And don't you read the papers?

568
00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.057
Don't you watch the news?

569
00:40:57.525 --> 00:40:58.960
Oh, turn right here.

570
00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:00.127

576
00:41:24.018 --> 00:41:25.653
and my tummy hurts.

577
00:41:25.686 --> 00:41:27.121
Can I please have some coke?

578
00:41:27.154 --> 00:41:29.156
Yes, baby.
But not too much.

579
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:36.063
(can pops)

580
00:41:36.097 --> 00:41:38.265
Now you're gonna have to be
more careful, baby.

581
00:41:38.299 --> 00:41:39.400
I told you.

582
00:41:39.433 --> 00:41:40.601
- I'm sorry.
- I'm terribly,

583
00:41:40.634 --> 00:41:41.702
terribly sorry.

584
00:41:41.736 --> 00:41:42.837
Oh, that's just the pits.

585
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.272
I know a little rest
stop up ahead

586
00:41:45.306 --> 00:41:47.341
where you can get cleaned up.

587
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:49.543
Oh, that has to be
awfully sticky.

588
00:41:49.577 --> 00:41:51.445
Here, make the next right.

589
00:41:51.479 --> 00:41:53.914
(truck engine rumbles)

590
00:41:55.583 --> 00:41:57.551
Where is this rest stop?

591
00:41:57.585 --> 00:41:59.453
Oh, it's right up the road.

592
00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:01.589
Why couldn't we stay on
the main road?

593
00:42:01.622 --> 00:42:04.325
[Rebecca] Oh, trust me, honey.
We're almost there.

594
00:42:04.358 --> 00:42:06.527
Besides, I said it's a
shortcut anyway.

595
00:42:07.595 --> 00:42:08.863

Britney Spears?

666
00:47:39.259 --> 00:47:40.260
Well.

667
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:42.863

Mom, you shouldn't smoke.

00:48:26.106 --> 00:48:28.142
Except in times of war.

673
00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:29.243

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.415
Elvis,

675
00:48:34.448 --> 00:48:35.115
hey.

676
00:48:35.149 --> 00:48:37.050
Elvis, can I get an autograph?

677
00:48:44.726 --> 00:48:46.260
Well, you got a pen and paper.

678
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:47.961
Of course.

679
00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:49.764
Mom, do you have a
pen and paper?

680
00:48:49.798 --> 00:48:51.098
Yes, darling.

681
00:48:55.537 --> 00:48:56.604
This is my truck.

682
00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:57.572
[Rebecca] No.

683
00:48:57.605 --> 00:48:59.072
- No.
- No.

684
00:49:02.744 --> 00:49:03.977
Yes, this is my truck.

685
00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:05.580
This isn't yours and
you know it.

686
00:49:05.613 --> 00:49:06.614
It is.

687
00:49:06.648 --> 00:49:08.449
We bought it.

688
00:49:08.482 --> 00:49:09.784
From who?

689
00:49:09.818 --> 00:49:11.351
Her name was Greta.

690
00:49:14.656 --> 00:49:15.657
What?

691
00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:18.225
What did you pay?

692
00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:20.427
$5,000.

693
00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:25.934
You have that kind of cash?

694
00:49:25.966 --> 00:49:28.168
- You got a receipt?
- No, I don't.

695
00:49:28.202 --> 00:49:30.471
She didn't have a pen and
paper at the time.

696
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:32.105
You just asked for some.

697
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.407
You know what?

698
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.876
Let's just let the
police decide.

699
00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:36.878
Now hey, we don't like that.

700
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:38.713
[Esther] Not all, no.

701
00:49:38.746 --> 00:49:41.482
You know, I wish people could
trust each other more

702
00:49:41.516 --> 00:49:43.016
in these difficult times.

703
00:49:45.587 --> 00:49:47.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
happened to Greta?

704
00:49:47.655 --> 00:49:48.623
She, well...

705
00:49:48.656 --> 00:49:51.992
She was very nice, I left
her my gummy bears.

706
00:49:52.927 --> 00:49:54.829
We lost her on some
road to Las Vegas.

707
00:49:54.863 --> 00:49:55.797
Where exactly?

708
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.898
I don't know.

709
00:49:56.931 --> 00:49:59.901
A little road, about 200
miles from here.

710
00:49:59.934 --> 00:50:01.836
Now, do you see what
I mean kids?

711
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.270
Times of war.

712
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.674
Times of war.

716
00:51:08.636 --> 00:51:10.404
Hey Charley.

717
00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:12.974
Hey, is that, that German woman
called you yet, Greta?

718
00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:14.909
No, but her husband did.

719
00:51:14.943 --> 00:51:17.244
He seems to have a huge problem.

720
00:51:17.277 --> 00:51:20.280
Well, look, if she calls,
tell her to call me okay?

(phone line clicks)

722
00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:24.652
Where are you?
The ladies are getting restless.

723
00:51:24.686 --> 00:51:27.220
(dial tone ringing)

724
00:51:27.755 --> 00:51:29.156
Okay.

725
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:32.060

726
00:51:32.092 --> 00:51:34.261

727
00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.942

728
00:51:47.976 --> 00:51:51.311
(vehicle engine revving)

729
00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:19.574
May I have some water please?

730
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:21.141
Sure.

731
00:52:22.543 --> 00:52:23.544
Thank you.

732
00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:30.350
I need to make a call.

733
00:52:30.384 --> 00:52:32.219
May I use your phone?

734
00:52:32.252 --> 00:52:33.554
Can she use yours?

735
00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:37.357
It's just a US call.

736
00:52:38.092 --> 00:52:39.292
It's so typical.

737
00:52:40.293 --> 00:52:41.361
How do I know if she won't
run off with it?

738
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:46.199
This is Marielle.

739
00:52:46.233 --> 00:52:48.069
We only use her for the...

740
00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:49.369
car pool lane.

741
00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:51.438
When we driving by ourselves.

742
00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:53.775
She needs some air, man.

743
00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:56.711
We could use a second one.

744
00:52:58.513 --> 00:52:59.614
Oh, come on.

745
00:52:59.647 --> 00:53:01.381
You're scaring her.

746
00:53:01.415 --> 00:53:03.551
I love your accent.
Where are you from?

747
00:53:03.584 --> 00:53:04.552
Let me guess...

748
00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:05.218
Sweden?

749
00:53:05.252 --> 00:53:07.088
I'm from Germany.

750
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:08.455
- Nice.
- Nice place.

751
00:53:09.023 --> 00:53:10.457
Where are you going?

752
00:53:11.592 --> 00:53:13.561
I'm going to see Willie
Nelson's farewell concert

753
00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:14.294
in Las Vegas.

754
00:53:14.327 --> 00:53:15.630
Hey, come with us.

755
00:53:15.663 --> 00:53:17.999
We're going to L.A.
for vacation.

756
00:53:18.032 --> 00:53:20.168
We could have a little party.

757
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.103
You could fly to Las
Vegas from there

758
00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:24.371
and we'll get lunch on
the way back.

759
00:53:24.404 --> 00:53:25.707
You must be starving.

760
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.240
Come on.

761
00:53:27.274 --> 00:53:28.776
Give her your damn cell phone.

762
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.579
No, she's gonna call Germany.
You know how much money that is?

763
00:53:31.612 --> 00:53:34.247
I just need to call
somebody in Los Angeles.

764
00:53:34.281 --> 00:53:35.817
Look, she even knows
somebody in Los Angeles

765
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.485
and she still doesn't wanna
drive with us over there.

766
00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:40.555
I don't trust her.

767
00:53:41.354 --> 00:53:42.957
Only if she gets in.

768
00:53:44.592 --> 00:53:46.761
Please, can I use your phone?

769
00:53:47.962 --> 00:53:49.329
How did you end up here?

770
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:51.264
Somebody stole my car.

771
00:53:51.298 --> 00:53:52.600
Stole your car?

772
00:53:52.633 --> 00:53:54.001
Yes, we--

773
00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:56.303
We live in times of war,
you know?

774
00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:58.740
What kind of bullshit is
she trying to sell?

775
00:53:58.773 --> 00:53:59.874
Jesus.

776
00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:01.008
Don't listen to him.

777
00:54:01.042 --> 00:54:02.275
Jump in the car.

778
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:04.145
We bring you to Los Angeles.

779
00:54:04.178 --> 00:54:06.581
Nothing's gonna happen,
I promise.

780
00:54:06.614 --> 00:54:08.415
Jump in, make the call
and jump out.

781
00:54:08.448 --> 00:54:11.552
I'm not gonna move the car,
not one inch.

782
00:54:13.888 --> 00:54:16.924
We'll drive you to the next gas
station, what about that?

783
00:54:20.194 --> 00:54:22.897
Okay, okay, then go.

784
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.098
(blows raspberry)

785
00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:26.601
Good luck out here on your own

786
00:54:26.634 --> 00:54:29.904
and have a good concert,
if you even make it.

787
00:54:29.937 --> 00:54:32.305

788
00:54:32.339 --> 00:54:34.942

791
00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:09.510
<i>Everybody's wondering</i>
<i>where she's at.</i>

792
00:55:09.544 --> 00:55:11.212
So she didn't call then?

793
00:55:11.245 --> 00:55:12.079
<i>No, she didn't call here.</i>

794
00:55:12.113 --> 00:55:13.313
Shit.

795
00:55:13.346 --> 00:55:14.481
<i>Yeah, I'd tell you,</i>

796
00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:15.950

798
00:55:16.984 --> 00:55:18.351
No, I hope she's okay.

940
01:03:08.389 --> 01:03:11.760
and this truck only drives
30 miles an hour.

941
01:03:11.825 --> 01:03:14.495
That means we have two
more hours to go

942
01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:16.230
and the concert starts...

943
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:18.332

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:32.887
Okay.

1101
01:12:34.222 --> 01:12:35.756
Where are you from?

1102
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.426
I'm from Germany.

1103
01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:41.329
Oh yeah, I was there
about five years ago.

1104
01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:42.530
I was in Munich.

1105
01:12:42.563 --> 01:12:44.131
It's a great country, I love it.

1106
01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:46.033
I learned to do the
Schuhplattler.

1107
01:12:47.168 --> 01:12:48.803
(Greta laughing)

1108
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.574
Well have a good stay.

1109
01:12:56.844 --> 01:12:57.912
Mr. Nelson.

1110
01:13:00.047 --> 01:13:01.048
Yeah?

1111
01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:04.018
I...

1112
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.953
I just need you to know

1113
01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:07.989
your music

1114
01:13:09.857 --> 01:13:11.926
always gave me hope.

1115
01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:14.394
It...

1116
01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:16.163
It...

1117
01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:19.700
always made me move forward
when I wanted to give up.

1118
01:13:22.603 --> 01:13:24.572
Well thank you very much for
that compliment.

1119
01:13:24.605 --> 01:13:26.707
But I'm sure that wasn't me.

1120
01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:29.577
I'm sure that was all in you.

1121
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.846
But you're right about
moving forward.

1122
01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:32.880
That's all we got.

1123
01:13:34.414 --> 01:13:37.018
(bus engine cranks)

1124
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.454
By the way, how'd you
like the concert?

1125
01:13:41.488 --> 01:13:42.757
I missed it.

1126
01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:46.193
Oh well,

1127
01:13:46.227 --> 01:13:48.162
maybe it wasn't the
last one anyway.

1128
01:13:58.372 --> 01:14:01.108
(harmonica music plays)

1129
01:14:44.452 --> 01:14:46.520
(Nick chuckles)

1130
01:14:47.288 --> 01:14:49.090
I did not sell your truck.

1131
01:14:49.824 --> 01:14:51.726
- I know.
- But I don't have it.

1132
01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:52.460
You know?

1133
01:14:52.526 --> 01:14:53.627
I got it back.

1134
01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:55.196
You got it back?

1135
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:56.430
I got it back.

1136
01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:59.066
I'm really lucky you
didn't sell my car.

1137
01:15:01.569 --> 01:15:02.536
I'm damn hungry.

1138
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:03.771
How about you?

1139
01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:05.840
Me too.

1140
01:15:06.807 --> 01:15:07.842
[Nick] So,

1141
01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:11.812
how did that lady and
the kids get my car?

1142
01:15:13.214 --> 01:15:16.083
Well, I was on the porta potty,

1143
01:15:16.484 --> 01:15:17.785
while...

1144
01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:21.655
(harmonica music playing)

1145
01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:34.902
I love the American kitchen.

1146
01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:37.738
It's so unhealthy but so good.

1147
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.942
Still no reason to burn down
your own kitchen.

1148
01:15:42.343 --> 01:15:43.544
No.

1149
01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.881
So you didn't do it on purpose.

1150
01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:48.749
What?

1151
01:15:49.483 --> 01:15:50.684
Your kitchen.

1152
01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:53.754
Your kitchen burned down.

1153
01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:57.191
Your husband called me
asking for you.

1154
01:15:57.224 --> 01:15:59.627
You spoke to my husband?

1155
01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:02.630
Yes, he called me.

1156
01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:04.131
Um,

1157
01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:07.601
he wanted to know if I thought
you had done it on purpose

1158
01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:11.338
or if you had said
anything about it

1159
01:16:11.372 --> 01:16:12.840
or whatever, the kitchen.

1160
01:16:13.574 --> 01:16:15.709
He got my number from the hotel.

1161
01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:24.618
the milk, could have done it.

1162
01:16:24.652 --> 01:16:26.487
But that's not your fault.

1163
01:16:26.521 --> 01:16:27.721
It's just bad luck.

1164
01:16:29.156 --> 01:16:30.157
For August.

1165
01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:31.792
Well,

1166
01:16:31.826 --> 01:16:33.994
it is kind of his own fault.

1167
01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:35.863
His fault?

1168
01:16:36.697 --> 01:16:38.632
Lady wants to go to a concert,

1169
01:16:38.666 --> 01:16:40.801
you take the lady to
the concert.

1170
01:16:44.071 --> 01:16:46.207
(Greta sighs)

01:16:48.543 --> 01:16:51.145

1173
01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:18.772
Hello.

1174
01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.675
- Ah, can we get...
- How can I help you?

1175
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:23.177
- Ummm...
- Um...

1176
01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:26.113
Two rooms for the night please.

1177
01:17:27.915 --> 01:17:30.951
And we need a taxi
in the morning

1178
01:17:30.985 --> 01:17:33.320
and a wake up call.
What time is your flight?

1179
01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:34.755
10.

1180
01:17:34.788 --> 01:17:37.559
10, you have to be
there at eight.

1181
01:17:37.592 --> 01:17:39.628
So seven for a wake up call.

1182
01:17:39.693 --> 01:17:40.861
Yes sir.

1183
01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:45.232
Pay tomorrow.

1184
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:49.870
Okay.

1185
01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:58.946
This is me.

1186
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:04.952
Nick.

1187
01:18:07.656 --> 01:18:08.856
Thank you.

1188
01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:12.726
Hey,

1189
01:18:13.794 --> 01:18:15.362
don't light any candles.

1190
01:18:16.565 --> 01:18:17.765
