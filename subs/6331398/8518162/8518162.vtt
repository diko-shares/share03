00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.198
Hello.

181
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:12.534
<i>Mrs. Weingarten,</i>

182
00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:14.134
<i>Were you planning on</i>
<i>checking out today?</i>

183
00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:16.571
Housekeeping needs to clean the
room for our next guest.

184
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:18.338
<i>What?</i>

185
00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.407
<i>My flight.</i>

186
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.074
What time?

187
00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:22.442
When is your flight?

188
00:17:23.711 --> 00:17:25.178
1:30.

189
00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:28.415
<i>Well, Mrs. Weingarten, it's one</i>
<i>o'clock right now.</i>

190
00:17:28.448 --> 00:17:30.552
I'm afraid you're not
gonna make it.

191
00:17:30.585 --> 00:17:31.686
Jet lags rough.

192
00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:33.353
Go ahead and take your time.

193
00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:36.323
<i>I'll move the other guests to</i>
<i>another room in the meantime.</i>

194
00:18:44.926 --> 00:18:46.259
Somebody robbed me.

195
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.228
Excuse me.

196
00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:50.430
Somebody stole all of my money.

197
00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:52.466
Well, I'm sorry to hear that
Mrs. Weingarten.

198
00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:54.736
Somebody stole your belongings
from your hotel room?

199
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:56.571
Yes.

200
00:18:57.572 --> 00:18:59.172
Well, do you know who this
somebody could be?

201
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:00.842
Yes.

202
00:19:02.209 --> 00:19:05.046
Well, do you want me to
call the police?

203
00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:08.348
You should file a
detailed report, ASAP.

204
00:19:08.382 --> 00:19:11.686
Chances are slim, but you
should still file.

205
00:19:12.419 --> 00:19:14.488
How much refund do I get back?

206
00:19:14.522 --> 00:19:17.457
You'll get $300 refund minus
the incidentals.

207
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.627
Did you take anything out
of the minibar?

208
00:19:20.895 --> 00:19:21.896
No.

209
00:19:22.997 --> 00:19:25.165
Well, then you'll get
a $300 refund.

210
00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.836
Is that enough to rent a
car to Las Vegas?

211
00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:30.237
Well, yes, maybe.

212
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:31.806
But how are you gonna rent a car

213
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.608
without a valid credit card?

214
00:19:33.641 --> 00:19:35.076
Everything in this
country works,

215
00:19:35.109 --> 00:19:37.578
if you have a valid credit card,
seemingly.

216
00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:41.082
May I offer you a call
on the house?

217
00:19:41.115 --> 00:19:42.482
It's right over there.

218
00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:44.686
Yes, thank you.

219
00:19:44.719 --> 00:19:45.720
Sure.

220
00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:06.206
August?

221
00:20:43.678 --> 00:20:44.444
Greta?

222
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:57.658
Rough night at the tables?

223
00:20:58.926 --> 00:20:59.927
Are you okay?

224
00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:02.663
No.

225
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:06.266
You wanna get a bite to eat?

226
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:08.401
Yes.

227
00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:10.571
I'm Nick, by the way.

228
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.472
Greta.

229
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:15.009
I know the best place in
town for burgers.

230
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.047
It's up this way.

231
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:22.315
This is a call from
Germany, Deutschland.

232
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:23.316
At <i>the</i>
<i>Grand Palace--</i>

233
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.552
This is long distance.

234
00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:26.254
Hello.

235
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.024
<i>A fresh lobster plate,</i>

236
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:33.261
<i>caviar at Falling Rocks and</i>
<i>the tuna dragon.</i>

237
00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:35.395
No, no, no, no, no,
no tuna dragon.

238
00:21:35.428 --> 00:21:37.364
I don't need that, no, no.

239
00:21:39.299 --> 00:21:40.735
Shit.

240
00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:44.138
Hey Jackson, did you see that
blonde German girl anywhere?

241
00:21:44.172 --> 00:21:45.740
Her husband's looking for her.

242
00:21:45.773 --> 00:21:47.608
No sir, I haven't.

243
00:21:47.642 --> 00:21:48.810
<i>If you prefer some</i>
<i>peace and quiet...</i>

244
00:21:48.843 --> 00:21:50.011
I don't need that.

245
00:21:50.044 --> 00:21:51.612
<i>Why don't you swing into</i>
<i>the wellness bar?</i>

246
00:21:52.713 --> 00:21:53.748
<i>A flower bath,</i>

247
00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:54.782
<i>a sea mud wrap...</i>

248
00:21:54.816 --> 00:21:56.284
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to be pulled</i>

249
00:21:56.316 --> 00:21:57.618
<i>into that advertisement,</i>
<i>stop it.</i>

250
00:21:57.652 --> 00:21:59.187
<i>...a full</i>
<i>body massage.</i>

251
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.354
<i>Why don't you just</i>
<i>wrap your fucking sea mud</i>

252
00:22:01.388 --> 00:22:03.024
around your fucking face?

253
00:22:03.858 --> 00:22:04.892
Sir?

254
00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:05.760
Yes, I'm still here.

255
00:22:05.793 --> 00:22:06.661
<i>Your wife</i>

256
00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:08.029
already left the
property, I'm sorry.

257
00:22:08.062 --> 00:22:09.764
Maybe you do need a massage.

258
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.699
Okay.

259
00:22:11.732 --> 00:22:12.733
To summarize,

260
00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:18.506
you sold your husband's Porsche
to pay for a plane ticket

261
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.609
to the United States to see
Willie Nelson's final concert.

262
00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:24.245
That asshole last
night robbed you.

263
00:22:24.278 --> 00:22:25.246
You lost all your money

264
00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:27.682
and you can't call your husband

265
00:22:27.715 --> 00:22:30.483
because he's still furious
about the Porsche.

266
00:22:32.186 --> 00:22:33.955
Somehow, understandable.

267
00:22:35.723 --> 00:22:37.525
How much money do you have?

268
00:22:38.893 --> 00:22:39.894
300.

269
00:22:40.962 --> 00:22:44.966
300, all right, online bookings
is doable, hotel.

270
00:22:46.167 --> 00:22:48.102
Maybe I could rustle
you up a car.

271
00:22:48.903 --> 00:22:50.037
Rustle you up?

272
00:22:52.907 --> 00:22:55.276
I have a friend who might
loan you his car,

273
00:22:55.309 --> 00:22:57.511
but it's still a
seven hour drive.

274
00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:00.014
Good. And...

275
00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.414
Check, please.

276
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:06.419
Look, if you want, you can stay
at my place tonight.

277
00:23:07.889 --> 00:23:09.857
I won't steal anything,
I promise.

278
00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:14.095
There is nothing left to steal.

279
00:23:25.373 --> 00:23:26.207
Nice place.

280
00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.375
Thanks.

281
00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:30.511
Help yourself with
anything in the fridge.

282
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:32.479
You can just put your stuff on
the couch if you want,

283
00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:34.081
make yourself comfortable.

284
00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:47.695
You know this one?

285
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.430

her collection.

No.

321
00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:53.941
Nah, he died young.

322
00:27:53.974 --> 00:27:57.711
I was, I was, I was too young,
didn't get a chance.

323
00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:02.950
Is that the reason you sing
in his costumes?

00:28:04.084 --> 00:28:05.119
No.

351
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:56.524
I don't know what it is
with Willie and me.

352
00:30:57.991 --> 00:31:00.427
He inspires me to do what I do.

353
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:06.033
Maybe I have to find out
what that is...

354
00:31:07.535 --> 00:31:08.536
exactly.

355
00:31:15.242 --> 00:31:18.112
So it's right up here.

356
00:31:18.145 --> 00:31:20.214
- Mm-hmm.
- I think you'll like.

358
00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:24.519
It's right here.

359
00:31:24.552 --> 00:31:26.186
Here, let me grab that for you.

360
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:32.126
But this is your truck.

361
00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:33.994
That's not the truck
of your friend.

362
00:31:34.027 --> 00:31:36.163
Ah, I've always been my
own best friend.

363
00:31:36.831 --> 00:31:38.198
Don't you need it?

364
00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:41.268
I work two blocks away,
I can walk.

365
00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:42.202
It's good for me.

366
00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:44.506
That way I don't become
the fat Elvis.

367
00:31:47.575 --> 00:31:48.743
Key.

368
00:31:48.777 --> 00:31:51.979
And you're gonna
need to fill up.

369
00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:54.348
Thank you Nick.

370
00:31:54.381 --> 00:31:55.215
You're welcome.

371
00:31:55.249 --> 00:31:58.452
So just call me when you
get there, okay?

372
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.090
Uh, hey!

373
00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:06.059
I...

374
00:32:06.861 --> 00:32:09.062
...love your red lips.

375
00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:12.199
Thank you.

376
00:32:13.033 --> 00:32:14.935
They remind me of somebody.

377
00:32:20.007 --> 00:32:23.444
Yeah, your lips remind me of
the exchange lady.

378
00:32:23.477 --> 00:32:24.478
Her lips.

379
00:32:25.647 --> 00:32:26.648
Oh.

380
00:32:28.883 --> 00:32:31.084
I found this in the elevator.

381
00:32:33.621 --> 00:32:34.622
Oh.

382
00:32:35.255 --> 00:32:36.223
Um...

383
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:37.859
Could you please give
it back to her?

384
00:32:37.892 --> 00:32:40.260
Oh sure, okay.

385
00:32:40.294 --> 00:32:45.265
So, just take a right and you're
on the US15 the whole way.

386
00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:47.735
I will call you as soon
as I get there.

387
00:32:47.769 --> 00:32:48.770
- Please.
- I promise.

388
00:32:48.803 --> 00:32:50.003
Please.

389
00:32:51.371 --> 00:32:52.740

444
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.982
Hi, nice to meet you.

445
00:38:01.015 --> 00:38:02.016
My name is David.

446
00:38:02.817 --> 00:38:03.818
Hi.

447
00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:06.821
Hello, I'm Esther,
nice to meet you.

448
00:38:07.221 --> 00:38:08.189
Hi.

449
00:38:08.222 --> 00:38:10.625
And my name's Gabriel. I'm six.

450
00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:16.631
I'm Rebecca, nice to meet you.

451
00:38:17.297 --> 00:38:18.331
Thank you so much.

452
00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:19.567
I'm Greta.

453
00:38:20.234 --> 00:38:21.869
Come, come with me.

454
00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:29.476
And you really think
everything that happens,

455
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.012
happens for a reason?

456
00:38:31.045 --> 00:38:32.680
That's right, Greta.

457
00:38:32.713 --> 00:38:34.615
That I should
not feel guilty

458
00:38:34.649 --> 00:38:38.052
that I sold my
husband's car because,

459
00:38:38.085 --> 00:38:41.222
in a way it is something that
he can learn from?

460
00:38:41.255 --> 00:38:42.723
That's right, Greta.

461
00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:45.893
What can he learn from it?

462
00:38:47.962 --> 00:38:50.898
Well, he could learn to let
go of materialism

463
00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:52.033
and to forgive.

464
00:38:52.066 --> 00:38:54.302
And if he can't learn to
forgive you, to let go,

465
00:38:54.334 --> 00:38:56.904
well then he is caged
inside of himself,

466
00:38:56.938 --> 00:38:58.606
angry and frustrated.

467
00:39:14.689 --> 00:39:15.990
Ulrich?

468
00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:45.152
See, it is what it is, says...

469
00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.287
Love!

470
00:39:50.725 --> 00:39:53.493
I should have at least
asked my husband

471
00:39:53.527 --> 00:39:55.563
before I sell his car.

472
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:59.333
That would've been
pretty stupid.

473
00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:02.970
But if you raised your
children so religious,

474
00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:06.107
doesn't religion say you
should not steal?

475
00:40:07.375 --> 00:40:09.210
That's right, Greta.

476
00:40:09.243 --> 00:40:10.443
David, why don't you begin

477
00:40:10.477 --> 00:40:12.647
with the first commandment
for Greta, please.

478
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.916
"I am the Lord, your God."

479
00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:17.685
"You shall worship no
other God but me."

480
00:40:18.886 --> 00:40:19.720
That's right.

481
00:40:19.754 --> 00:40:21.522
"You should honor your mother."

482
00:40:21.555 --> 00:40:23.391
"You should not commit murder."

483
00:40:23.423 --> 00:40:24.959
Except in times of war.

484
00:40:25.793 --> 00:40:27.595
"You should not
commit adultery."

485
00:40:27.628 --> 00:40:29.030
Except in times of war.

486
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.198
You should not...

487
00:40:31.232 --> 00:40:33.200
You should not steal or lie.

488
00:40:33.234 --> 00:40:35.136
Except in times of war.

489
00:40:35.169 --> 00:40:37.038
You should not covet your
neighbor's housekeeper,

490
00:40:37.071 --> 00:40:40.942
gardener, car or anything else
your neighbor possesses.

491
00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:42.877
- Except in times of war.
- Except in times of war.

492
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.345
- In times of war.
- In times of war.

493
00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:45.212
- War.
- War.

494
00:40:45.246 --> 00:40:46.446
Amen.

495
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:53.254
Lucky, we don't live
in times of war.

496
00:40:53.287 --> 00:40:54.522
And don't you read the papers?

497
00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.057

Oh yes it was so nice.

562
00:46:38.265 --> 00:46:40.100
But could you put the
Elvis costume on?

563
00:46:40.134 --> 00:46:42.704
- Oh yeah.
- It looks so good on you.

564
00:46:42.737 --> 00:46:45.873
Yes, the beautiful glittery one.

565
00:46:45.906 --> 00:46:48.576
He looks great in jeans too.

566
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.110
The sparkly one.

567
00:46:50.144 --> 00:46:51.713
You look best in the
sparkly one.

568
00:46:51.746 --> 00:46:52.946
And you know.

569
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:58.252
Already done?

570
00:46:59.019 --> 00:47:01.288
No, but I forgot my costume.

571
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:02.890
Forgot?

572
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.458
Hey,

573
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:05.993
thanks again for the lipstick.

574
00:47:06.026 --> 00:47:08.495
Guess what I found in
the elevator?

575
00:47:14.569 --> 00:47:15.502
Oh?

576
00:47:16.638 --> 00:47:19.440
That's for her too,
if she likes.

577
00:47:21.509 --> 00:47:23.377
I'm sure she likes.

578
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.411
Thank you.

579
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.121
Mom?

580
00:47:34.855 --> 00:47:36.056
Yes, darling?

581
00:47:36.957 --> 00:47:38.459
Do you think I look like
Britney Spears?

582
00:47:39.259 --> 00:47:40.260
Well.

583
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:42.863
Maybe just a little bit?

584
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:46.266
No, honey, you're
more beautiful.

585
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:06.453
You sit tight kids,
I need a cigarette.

586
00:48:23.904 --> 00:48:26.073
Mom, you shouldn't smoke.

587
00:48:26.106 --> 00:48:28.142
Except in times of war.

588
00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:29.243
Shut up.

589
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.415
Elvis,

590
00:48:34.448 --> 00:48:35.115
hey.

591
00:48:35.149 --> 00:48:37.050
Elvis, can I get an autograph?

592
00:48:44.726 --> 00:48:46.260
Well, you got a pen and paper.

593
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:47.961
Of course.

594
00:48:47.995 --> 00:48:49.764
Mom, do you have a
pen and paper?

595
00:48:49.798 --> 00:48:51.098
Yes, darling.

596
00:48:55.537 --> 00:48:56.604
This is my truck.

597
00:48:56.638 --> 00:48:57.572
No.

598
00:48:57.605 --> 00:48:59.072
- No.
- No.

599
00:49:02.744 --> 00:49:03.977
Yes, this is my truck.

600
00:49:04.011 --> 00:49:05.580
This isn't yours and
you know it.

601
00:49:05.613 --> 00:49:06.614
It is.

602
00:49:06.648 --> 00:49:08.449
We bought it.

603
00:49:08.482 --> 00:49:09.784
From who?

604
00:49:09.818 --> 00:49:11.351
Her name was Greta.

605
00:49:14.656 --> 00:49:15.657
What?

606
00:49:17.024 --> 00:49:18.225
What did you pay?

607
00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:20.427
$5,000.

608
00:49:23.297 --> 00:49:25.934
You have that kind of cash?

609
00:49:25.966 --> 00:49:28.168
- You got a receipt?
- No, I don't.

610
00:49:28.202 --> 00:49:30.471
She didn't have a pen and
paper at the time.

611
00:49:30.505 --> 00:49:32.105
You just asked for some.

612
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.407
You know what?

613
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.876
Let's just let the
police decide.

614
00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:36.878
Now hey, we don't like that.

615
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:38.713
Not all, no.

616
00:49:38.746 --> 00:49:41.482
You know, I wish people could
trust each other more

617
00:49:41.516 --> 00:49:43.016
in these difficult times.

618
00:49:45.587 --> 00:49:47.622
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
happened to Greta?

619
00:49:47.655 --> 00:49:48.623
She, well...

620
00:49:48.656 --> 00:49:51.992
She was very nice, I left
her my gummy bears.

621
00:49:52.927 --> 00:49:54.829
We lost her on some
road to Las Vegas.

622
00:49:54.863 --> 00:49:55.797
Where exactly?

623
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:56.898
I don't know.

624
00:49:56.931 --> 00:49:59.901
A little road, about 200
miles from here.

625
00:49:59.934 --> 00:50:01.836
Now, do you see what
I mean kids?

626
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.270
Times of war.

627
00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:06.674
Times of war.

628
00:51:08.636 --> 00:51:10.404
Hey Charley.

629
00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:12.974
Hey, is that, that German woman
called you yet, Greta?

630
00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:14.909
No, but her husband did.

631
00:51:14.943 --> 00:51:17.244
He seems to have a huge problem.

632
00:51:17.277 --> 00:51:20.280
Well, look, if she calls,
tell her to call me okay?

633
00:51:20.314 --> 00:51:22.115
<i>Will do, Nick.</i>

634
00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:24.652
Where are you?
The ladies are getting restless.

635
00:51:27.755 --> 00:51:29.156
Okay.

636
00:52:17.471 --> 00:52:19.574
May I have some water please?

637
00:52:19.941 --> 00:52:21.141
Sure.

638
00:52:22.543 --> 00:52:23.544
Thank you.

639
00:52:29.083 --> 00:52:30.350
I need to make a call.

640
00:52:30.384 --> 00:52:32.219
May I use your phone?

641
00:52:32.252 --> 00:52:33.554
Can she use yours?

642
00:52:35.355 --> 00:52:37.357
It's just a US call.

643
00:52:38.092 --> 00:52:39.292
It's so typical.

644
00:52:40.293 --> 00:52:41.361
How do I know if she won't
run off with it?

645
00:52:44.599 --> 00:52:46.199
This is Marielle.

646
00:52:46.233 --> 00:52:48.069
We only use her for the...

647
00:52:48.102 --> 00:52:49.369
car pool lane.

648
00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:51.438
When we driving by ourselves.

649
00:52:52.239 --> 00:52:53.775
She needs some air, man.

650
00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:56.711
We could use a second one.

651
00:52:58.513 --> 00:52:59.614
Oh, come on.

652
00:52:59.647 --> 00:53:01.381
You're scaring her.

653
00:53:01.415 --> 00:53:03.551
I love your accent.
Where are you from?

654
00:53:03.584 --> 00:53:04.552
Let me guess...

655
00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:05.218
Sweden?

656
00:53:05.252 --> 00:53:07.088
I'm from Germany.

657
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:08.455
- Nice.
- Nice place.

658
00:53:09.023 --> 00:53:10.457
Where are you going?

659
00:53:11.592 --> 00:53:13.561
I'm going to see Willie
Nelson's farewell concert

660
00:53:13.594 --> 00:53:14.294
in Las Vegas.

661
00:53:14.327 --> 00:53:15.630
Hey, come with us.

662
00:53:15.663 --> 00:53:17.999
We're going to L.A.
for vacation.

663
00:53:18.032 --> 00:53:20.168
We could have a little party.

664
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:22.103
You could fly to Las
Vegas from there

665
00:53:22.136 --> 00:53:24.371
and we'll get lunch on
the way back.

666
00:53:24.404 --> 00:53:25.707
You must be starving.

667
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.240
Come on.

668
00:53:27.274 --> 00:53:28.776
Give her your damn cell phone.

669
00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.579
No, she's gonna call Germany.
You know how much money that is?

670
00:53:31.612 --> 00:53:34.247
I just need to call
somebody in Los Angeles.

671
00:53:34.281 --> 00:53:35.817
Look, she even knows
somebody in Los Angeles

672
00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.485
and she still doesn't wanna
drive with us over there.

673
00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:40.555
I don't trust her.

674
00:53:41.354 --> 00:53:42.957
Only if she gets in.

675
00:53:44.592 --> 00:53:46.761
Please, can I use your phone?

676
00:53:47.962 --> 00:53:49.329
How did you end up here?

677
00:53:49.362 --> 00:53:51.264
Somebody stole my car.

678
00:53:51.298 --> 00:53:52.600
Stole your car?

679
00:53:52.633 --> 00:53:54.001
Yes, we--

680
00:53:54.035 --> 00:53:56.303
We live in times of war,
you know?

681
00:53:56.336 --> 00:53:58.740
What kind of bullshit is
she trying to sell?

682
00:53:58.773 --> 00:53:59.874
Jesus.

683
00:53:59.907 --> 00:54:01.008
Don't listen to him.

684
00:54:01.042 --> 00:54:02.275
Jump in the car.

685
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:04.145
We bring you to Los Angeles.

686
00:54:04.178 --> 00:54:06.581
Nothing's gonna happen,
I promise.

687
00:54:06.614 --> 00:54:08.415
Jump in, make the call
and jump out.

688
00:54:08.448 --> 00:54:11.552
I'm not gonna move the car,
not one inch.

689
00:54:13.888 --> 00:54:16.924
We'll drive you to the next gas
station, what about that?

690
00:54:20.194 --> 00:54:22.897
Okay, okay, then go.

691
00:54:24.132 --> 00:54:26.601
Good luck out here on your own

692
00:54:26.634 --> 00:54:29.904
and have a good concert,
if you even make it.

693
00:55:06.774 --> 00:55:08.209
<i>Yeah there's a</i>
<i>frenzy over here.</i>

694
00:55:08.242 --> 00:55:09.510
<i>Everybody's wondering</i>
<i>where she's at.</i>

695
00:55:09.544 --> 00:55:11.212
So she didn't call then?

696
00:55:11.245 --> 00:55:12.079
<i>No, she didn't call here.</i>

697
00:55:12.113 --> 00:55:13.313
Shit.

698
00:55:13.346 --> 00:55:14.481
<i>Yeah, I'd tell you,</i>
<i>you know that.</i>

699
00:55:14.515 --> 00:55:15.950
I appreciate it, Ron.

700
00:55:15.983 --> 00:55:16.951
<i>My pleasure.</i>

701
00:55:16.984 --> 00:55:18.351
No, I hope she's okay.

Friend.

730
00:58:39.453 --> 00:58:40.855
Her car was stolen.

731
00:58:42.156 --> 00:58:45.026
She's lost somewhere
between Los Angeles

732
00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:46.060
and Las Vegas

733
00:58:47.194 --> 00:58:50.297
on her way to see Willie
Nelson's farewell concert.

734
00:58:50.331 --> 00:58:52.600
- His last one, right?
- Uh huh.

735
00:58:52.633 --> 00:58:54.568
Well, we've heard that before.

736
00:58:54.935 --> 00:58:55.970
Yeah.

737
00:58:56.904 --> 00:58:58.706
Why don't you write your
phone number down

738
00:58:58.739 --> 00:59:01.742
and if she comes through,
I'll call you.

739

All I know is that

763
00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:57.698
she's somewhere between
here and Vegas.

764

01:00:00.701 --> 01:00:02.036
Where is she lost?

767
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.772
She was on her way to Willie
Nelson's farewell concert.

768
01:00:04.805 --> 01:00:06.040
<i>No, no, no, I told her,</i>

769

<i>Burning down the kitchen.</i>

No, that's why I
coudn't drive faster.

30 miles an hour.

822

more hours to go

and the concert starts...

824
01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:18.332

Mr. Nelson?

Yeah.

931
01:11:21.616 --> 01:11:23.851
May I have your autograph?

932
01:11:24.986 --> 01:11:26.053
Sure.

No.

- Here you go.

01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:36.429

Okay.

970
01:12:34.222 --> 01:12:35.756
Where are you from?

971
01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.426
I'm from Germany.

972
01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:41.329
Oh yeah, I was there
about five years ago.

973
01:12:41.361 --> 01:12:42.530
I was in Munich.

974
01:12:42.563 --> 01:12:44.131
It's a great country, I love it.

975
01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:46.033
I learned to do the
Schuhplattler.

976
01:12:52.206 --> 01:12:53.574
Well have a good stay.

977
01:12:56.844 --> 01:12:57.912
Mr. Nelson.

978
01:13:00.047 --> 01:13:01.048
Yeah?

979
01:13:02.683 --> 01:13:04.018
I...

980
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:05.953
I just need you to know

981
01:13:06.354 --> 01:13:07.989
your music

982
01:13:09.857 --> 01:13:11.926
always gave me hope.

983
01:13:12.994 --> 01:13:14.394
It...

984
01:13:15.062 --> 01:13:16.163
It...

985
01:13:16.197 --> 01:13:19.700
always made me move forward
when I wanted to give up.

986
01:13:22.603 --> 01:13:24.572
Well thank you very much for
that compliment.

987
01:13:24.605 --> 01:13:26.707
But I'm sure that wasn't me.

988
01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:29.577
I'm sure that was all in you.

989
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.846
But you're right about
moving forward.

990
01:13:31.879 --> 01:13:32.880
That's all we got.

991
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:41.454
By the way, how'd you
like the concert?

992
01:13:41.488 --> 01:13:42.757
I missed it.

993
01:13:44.825 --> 01:13:46.193
Oh well,

994
01:13:46.227 --> 01:13:48.162
maybe it wasn't the
last one anyway.

995
01:14:47.288 --> 01:14:49.090
I did not sell your truck.

996
01:14:49.824 --> 01:14:51.726
- I know.
- But I don't have it.

997
01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:52.460
You know?

998
01:14:52.526 --> 01:14:53.627
I got it back.

999
01:14:54.095 --> 01:14:55.196
You got it back?

1000
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:56.430
I got it back.

1001
01:14:56.464 --> 01:14:59.066
I'm really lucky you
didn't sell my car.

1002
01:15:01.569 --> 01:15:02.536
I'm damn hungry.

1003
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:03.771
How about you?

1004
01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:05.840
Me too.

1005
01:15:06.807 --> 01:15:07.842
So,

1006
01:15:07.875 --> 01:15:11.812
how did that lady and
the kids get my car?

1007
01:15:13.214 --> 01:15:16.083
Well, I was on the porta potty,

1008
01:15:16.484 --> 01:15:17.785
while...

1009
01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:34.902
I love the American kitchen.

1010
01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:37.738
It's so unhealthy but so good.

1011
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.942
Still no reason to burn down
your own kitchen.

1012
01:15:42.343 --> 01:15:43.544
No.

1013
01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.881
So you didn't do it on purpose.

1014
01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:48.749
What?

1015
01:15:49.483 --> 01:15:50.684
Your kitchen.

1016
01:15:52.219 --> 01:15:53.754
Your kitchen burned down.

1017
01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:57.191
Your husband called me
asking for you.

1018
01:15:57.224 --> 01:15:59.627
You spoke to my husband?

1019
01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:02.630
Yes, he called me.

1020
01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:04.131
Um,

1021
01:16:04.165 --> 01:16:07.601
he wanted to know if I thought
you had done it on purpose

1022
01:16:07.635 --> 01:16:11.338
or if you had said
anything about it

1023
01:16:11.372 --> 01:16:12.840
or whatever, the kitchen.

1024
01:16:13.574 --> 01:16:15.709
He got my number from the hotel.

1025
01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:24.618
the milk, could have done it.

1026
01:16:24.652 --> 01:16:26.487
But that's not your fault.

1027
01:16:26.521 --> 01:16:27.721
It's just bad luck.

1028
01:16:29.156 --> 01:16:30.157
For August.

1029
01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:31.792
Well,

1030
01:16:31.826 --> 01:16:33.994
it is kind of his own fault.

1031
01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:35.863
His fault?

1032
01:16:36.697 --> 01:16:38.632
Lady wants to go to a concert,

1033
01:16:38.666 --> 01:16:40.801
you take the lady to
the concert.

1034
01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:18.772
Hello.

1035
01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:21.675
- Ah, can we get...
- How can I help you?

1036
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:23.177
- Ummm...
- Um...

1037
01:17:23.978 --> 01:17:26.113
Two rooms for the night please.

1038
01:17:27.915 --> 01:17:30.951
And we need a taxi
in the morning

1039
01:17:30.985 --> 01:17:33.320
and a wake up call.
What time is your flight?

1040
01:17:33.954 --> 01:17:34.755
10.

1041
01:17:34.788 --> 01:17:37.559
10, you have to be
there at eight.

1042
01:17:37.592 --> 01:17:39.628
So seven for a wake up call.

1043
01:17:39.693 --> 01:17:40.861
Yes sir.

1044
01:17:43.797 --> 01:17:45.232
Pay tomorrow.

1045
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:49.870
Okay.

1046
01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:58.946
This is me.

1047
01:18:03.951 --> 01:18:04.952
Nick.

1048
01:18:07.656 --> 01:18:08.856
Thank you.

1049
01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:12.726
Hey,

1050
01:18:13.794 --> 01:18:15.362

No.

Greta!

1053
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.171
Who cares.

1054
01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:32.906
<i>Who cares?</i>

1055
01:19:41.315 --> 01:19:42.316

1058
01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:57.592
I have nothing to wear.

1059
01:20:58.859 --> 01:21:00.327
