00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.600
What did we talk about?
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

167
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.936
I guess I tell people about
Sammy to help them understand.

168
00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:31.397
Sammy's story helps me
understand my own situation.

169
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:35.624
Well, Sammy wrote himself
endless amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

170
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:40.166
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

171
00:16:42.627 --> 00:16:45.245
I'm disciplined and organized.

172
00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:48.456
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

173
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:51.094
Sammy had no drive,
no reason to make it work.

174
00:16:52.554 --> 00:16:56.599
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

You did explain, Lenny.

My wife called me Lenny.

-No.

-Yeah.
-Well, then, you shouldn't have to ask.

But even if you get revenge,
you‘re not gonna remember it.

208

Doesn't make any difference
whether I know about it.

Just because there are things I don't remember
doesn't make my actions meaningless.

I, um--I added
an address in here.

00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:55.286
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

bigger deals there.

232

I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.

248
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:25.084
I'd investigate the claims

-Why not?
-Because your notes could be unreliable.

-Memory's unreliable.
-Oh, please!

277
00:23:52.556 --> 00:23:55.007
No, really. Memory's not perfect.
It‘s not even that good.

I know. It‘s what I used to do.

Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

822
01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.040
-Why?
-Why? Because of you.

823
01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.084
Because I did what you told me to!
Go in and reason with him!

824
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.961
Tell him about Teddy!
Great fucking idea!

825
01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.296
Calm down. Take it easy.

826
01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:27.891
You're safe. It‘s okay.

827
01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.760
Come on. Just sit down.

828
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.803
Sit down.

829
01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.440
Here. Sit down.

830
01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:38.850
Okay. You're okay.

831
01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.030

832

833

I did exactly
what you told me to do.

834
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.999
I went to Dodd...

835
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:07.226
and I told him that l--
I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

836
01:11:07.388 --> 01:11:09.839
or the drugs,

837
01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:14.010
and that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

838
01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.721
And what did he say?

839
01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.525
He didn't believe me.

840
01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:24.437
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow,
he's gonna kill me.

841
01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:28.566
And then he just--
he just started hitting me.

842
01:11:28.576 --> 01:11:31.486
Where is he?

843
01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.614
-Why?
-I'II go see him.

844
01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:36.825
-And?
-I'll give him some bruises of his own...

845
01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:38.827
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

846
01:11:38.837 --> 01:11:41.172
Ah, he'll kill you, Lenny.

847
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:45.250
My wife used to call me Lenny.

848
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.594
Yeah?

849
01:11:48.263 --> 01:11:51.089
Yeah. I hated it.

850
01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:54.217
Oh, this guy--
this guy is so dangerous.

851
01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.887
-Let's just think of something else, okay?
-No, no.

852
01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:01.558
You just tell me what he looks like...
and where I can find him.

853
01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:05.238
-Have you got a pen?
-In my purse.

854
01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.490
He'll, um--
He'll probably find you.

855
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.702
-What do you mean?
-I told him about your car.

856

857
01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:28.001

I had to tell him something.

What happened is Jimmy went

and he never came back.

-My number's on the bottom if you need me.
-You're not coming?

1144
01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.504
No. It wouldn't be appropriate.

1145
01:36:04.217 --> 01:36:07.804
Nice picture...
I look thin.

1146
01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:14.227
Hey, Lenny...

01:37:54.703 --> 01:37:56.277
You Jimmy Grants?

-Do you remember me?
-Yeah, I remember you.

-Strip.
-You‘re making a big fucking mistake, pal.

Strip!

My associates are not the kind
of people you wanna piss off.

Don‘t say anything else.

1163
01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:27.819
-I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
-Take it off.

<i>-Your pants too.</i>
-Why?

1166
01:38:36.661 --> 01:38:39.237
I don't wanna get blood on them.

1167
01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:42.365
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

1168
01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:46.286
-Take your fuckin' pants off!
-I‘ve got two-hundred grand stashed in the car!

1169
01:38:46.296 --> 01:38:48.663
-Just take it!
-What? You think you can bargain with me?

1170
01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:50.081
<i>Just take the money and walk away!</i>

1171
01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.250

01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.973
<i>-What do you want from me?</i>
-I want my fuckin' life back!

01:40:28.481 --> 01:40:30.400
Sammy.

1175
01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:38.648
[Thinking] He said "Sammy."
How does he know about Sammy?

1176
01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:40.451
Oh, fuck.

1177
01:41:00.722 --> 01:41:04.173
[Thinking]
What have I done?

1178
01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:07.468
Hey, mister, I need help.
There's a guy in here, he‘s hurt bad.

1179
01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:10.023
-We gotta get him to a doctor.
-All right.

1180
01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:13.266
I don't know what happened.

1181
01:41:13.276 --> 01:41:16.936
-l've got this memory thing. Do I know you?
-No. Don‘t worry. I'm a cop.

1182
01:41:16.946 --> 01:41:20.273
-Is he still breathing?
-I don't know. Maybe.

1183
01:41:20.283 --> 01:41:22.400
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

1184
01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:25.528
Well, I don't remember.
I have this condition.

1185
01:41:25.538 --> 01:41:28.781
<i>Well, I hope it’s not as serious as his,
‘cause this guy’s dead.</i>

1186
01:41:28.791 --> 01:41:31.993
<i>Owl Lenny! That shit kills!</i>

1187
01:41:32.003 --> 01:41:35.121
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin' cop.

1188
01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:37.415
Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.

1189
01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:39.500
Get up. Get up.

1190
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:41.804
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1191
01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:46.925
Who is that? He knew me.

1192
01:41:46.935 --> 01:41:49.510
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

1193
01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.721
Bullshit.
He's not the guy.

1194
01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:55.948
His name is James F. Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

1195
01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:58.321
-What was he bringing the two-hundred grand for?
-What?

1196
01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:03.024
-What was it for?
-A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

1197
01:42:03.034 --> 01:42:06.736
-Is this a drug deal?
-No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1198
01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:08.488
Look, Leonard, Jimmy's your guy.

1199
01:42:08.498 --> 01:42:11.407
-I just figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.
-How did he know me?

1200
01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:14.118
The Discount Inn.
He dealt out of there.

1201
01:42:14.128 --> 01:42:17.455
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

1202
01:42:17.465 --> 01:42:19.999
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump.

1203
01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:22.543
-You're fucking using me.
-No! You get half!

1204
01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:25.213
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1205
01:42:25.223 --> 01:42:28.633
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.

1206
01:42:28.643 --> 01:42:30.843
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1207
01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:33.763
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

1208
01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:36.724
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

1209
01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:38.935
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

1210
01:42:38.945 --> 01:42:41.739
Who cares if there's
a few little details you'd rather not remember?

1211
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:46.776
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-I don't know.

1212
01:42:46.786 --> 01:42:50.405
<i>Your wife surviving the assault.</i>

1213
01:42:50.415 --> 01:42:54.158
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish

1214
01:42:54.168 --> 01:42:56.869
<i>tearing her up inside.</i>

1215
01:42:56.879 --> 01:42:58.423
The insulin.

1216
01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:02.417
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1217
01:43:02.427 --> 01:43:05.461
Yeah, right. Like you tell yourself
over and over again.

1218
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.672
<i>Conditioning yourself to remember.</i>

1219
01:43:07.682 --> 01:43:10.341
-Learning through repetition.
-Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1220
01:43:10.351 --> 01:43:14.568
-Sammy ended up in an institution.
-Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1221
01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:17.640
I never said that Sammy was faking.

1222
01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:20.852
You exposed him for what he was--a fraud.

1223
01:43:20.862 --> 01:43:23.855
But I was wrong.
That's the whole point.

1224
01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:26.826
-See, Sammy's wife came to me.
-Sammy didn't have a wife.

1225
01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:32.749
It was <i>your</i> wife who had diabetes.

1226
01:43:39.005 --> 01:43:40.256
Ouch.

1227
01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:43.718
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1228
01:43:44.635 --> 01:43:45.803
You sure?

1229
01:43:51.142 --> 01:43:54.969
-Ouch. Cut it out.
-She wasn't diabetic.

1230
01:43:54.979 --> 01:43:57.555
You think I don't know my own wife?

1231
01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:59.182
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1232
01:43:59.192 --> 01:44:02.602
Well, I guess I can only make you
remember the things you wanna be true.

1233
01:44:02.612 --> 01:44:05.063
<i>-Like old Jimmy down there.</i>
-He's not the right guy.

1234
01:44:05.073 --> 01:44:07.315
He was to you.

1235
01:44:07.325 --> 01:44:10.818
<i>Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.</i>

1236
01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:13.446
<i>What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?</i>

1237
01:44:13.456 --> 01:44:15.990
-It makes all the difference.
-Why? You‘re never gonna know.

1238
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.366
-Yes, I will.
-No, you won't.

1239
01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:19.285
I will. Somehow I'll know.

1240
01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:21.579
-You won't remember!
-When it‘s done, I will know. It'll be different.

1241
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:25.176
Well, I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn't!

1242
01:44:28.137 --> 01:44:31.589
That's right.
The real John G.

1243
01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:34.842
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He's already dead.

1244
01:44:34.852 --> 01:44:38.805
-Don’t lie to me anymore.
-Look, Lenny.

1245
01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:41.641
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case.
I believed you.

1246
01:44:41.651 --> 01:44:44.435
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1247
01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:47.396
<i>I’m the one that helped you
find the other guy in your bathroom that night,</i>

1248
01:44:47.406 --> 01:44:50.024
<i>the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.</i>

1249
01:44:50.034 --> 01:44:52.286
We found him.
You killed him.

1250
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:56.447
But you didn‘t remember.

1251
01:44:56.457 --> 01:44:59.700
<i>So I helped you start looking again,</i>

1252
01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:02.036
looking for the guy you already killed.

1253
01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:04.288
Oh, yeah? So who was he?

1254
01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:06.791
Just some guy.
I mean, does it even matter who?

1255
01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:11.018
<i>No reason, Lenny.
No conspiracy. Just bad fucking luck.</i>

1256
01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:15.689
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1257
01:45:16.769 --> 01:45:20.986
<i>But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you’d remember.</i>

1258
01:45:21.691 --> 01:45:24.392
But it didn't stick.

1259
01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:26.571
<i>Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won’t stick.</i>

1260
01:45:31.284 --> 01:45:35.621
<i>I took that picture…
just when you did it.</i>

1261
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:40.324
Look how happy you are.

1262
01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:42.910
<i>I wanted to see that face again.</i>

1263
01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:45.955
-Oh, gee, thanks.
-Fuck you.

1264
01:45:45.965 --> 01:45:49.709
I gave you a reason to live,
and you were more than happy to help.

1265
01:45:49.719 --> 01:45:53.838
<i>You don’t want the truth.
You make up your own truth.</i>

1266
01:45:53.848 --> 01:45:56.048
Like your police file.

1267
01:45:56.058 --> 01:45:59.427
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

1268
01:45:59.437 --> 01:46:02.555
-You, probably.
-No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1269
01:46:02.565 --> 01:46:06.225
-Why would I do that?
-To create a puzzle you could never solve.

1270
01:46:06.235 --> 01:46:08.186
Do you know how many--
how many towns?

1271
01:46:08.196 --> 01:46:10.479
How many John G.'s
or James G.‘s?

1272
01:46:10.489 --> 01:46:12.648
I mean, shit, Lenny,
I'm a fucking John G.

1273
01:46:12.658 --> 01:46:15.902
-Your name is Teddy.
-My mother calls me Teddy.

1274
01:46:15.912 --> 01:46:18.946
My name's
John Edward Gammell.

1275
01:46:18.956 --> 01:46:20.031
<i>Cheer up.</i>

1276
01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:22.585
There's plenty of John G.'s
for us to find.

1277
01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:28.873
<i>All you do is moan.</i>

1278
01:46:28.883 --> 01:46:30.875
<i>I’m the one that has to live
with what you’ve done.</i>

1279
01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:33.044
I‘m the one that put it all together.

1280
01:46:33.054 --> 01:46:37.271
You, you wander around, you’re playing detective.
You're living a dream, kid.

1281
01:46:37.808 --> 01:46:41.469
<i>A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.</i>

1282
01:46:41.479 --> 01:46:44.941
A romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn‘t in the picture.

1283
01:46:46.442 --> 01:46:49.769
-I should kill you.
-Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1284
01:46:49.779 --> 01:46:53.366
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1285
01:46:55.952 --> 01:46:59.028
Come on. What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

1286
01:46:59.038 --> 01:47:00.957
It‘s beer o'clock. I‘m buying.

1287
01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:04.877
Fuck.

1288
01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:16.837
[Thinking]
I‘m not a killer.

1289
01:47:16.847 --> 01:47:20.059
I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.

1290
01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:28.317
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1291
01:47:45.042 --> 01:47:48.170
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1292
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:07.027
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?
Another John G. to look for?

1293
01:48:07.315 --> 01:48:09.525
You're a John G.

1294
01:48:12.111 --> 01:48:14.071
So you can be my John G.

1295
01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:25.489
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1296
01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:28.909
<i>In your case, Teddy,</i>

1297
01:48:28.919 --> 01:48:31.464
yes, I will.

1298
01:48:43.142 --> 01:48:45.801
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1299
01:48:45.811 --> 01:48:49.013
-It is now.
<i>-Jesus Christ, you can’t take it!</i>

1300
01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:51.307
-Why not?
-Because the guy you just killed owns it!

1301
01:48:51.317 --> 01:48:54.477
<i>Somebody’ll recognize it!</i>

1302
01:48:54.487 --> 01:48:58.704
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

1303
01:48:59.158 --> 01:49:02.568
I might hang on to this for a while.

1304
01:49:02.578 --> 01:49:07.208
Lenny. Look, don't--
Will you help me find the keys?

1305
01:49:08.626 --> 01:49:10.326
Help me find my keys.

1306
01:49:10.336 --> 01:49:11.504
Lenny!

1307
01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:19.553
<i>Lenny!</i>

1308
01:49:32.525 --> 01:49:35.851
[Thinking] l have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

1309
01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:38.020
l have to believe that
my actions still have meaning,

1310
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:41.148
even if I can't remember them.

1311
01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:44.527
I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed,

1312
01:49:44.537 --> 01:49:46.831
the world's still here.

1313
01:49:48.332 --> 01:49:50.418
Do I believe the world's still here?

1314
01:49:53.671 --> 01:49:55.506
Is it still out there?

1315
01:49:58.634 --> 01:49:59.802
Yeah.

1316
01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:04.932
We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.

1317
01:50:07.435 --> 01:50:09.019
I'm no different.

1318
01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:23.284
Now, where was I?
