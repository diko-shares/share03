00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:07.183
<i>So where are you?
You’re in some motel room.</i>

2
00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:10.394
<i>You just wake up,
and you’re in a motel room.</i>

3
00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:13.814
<i>There’s the key. It feels like maybe
it’s just the first time you’ve been there…</i>

4
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:18.486
<i>but… perhaps you’ve been there for a week…</i>

5
00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.112
<i>three months.</i>

6
00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:23.407
<i>It’s kind of hard to say.
I don’t know.</i>

7
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:25.808
<i>It’s just an anonymous room.</i>

8
00:03:27.244 --> 00:03:29.288
<i>It’s just an anonymous room.</i>

9
00:03:29.372 --> 00:03:31.373
<i>There’s nothing in the drawers.
But you look anyway.</i>

10
00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:36.378
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible,
which I, of course, read religiously.</i>

11
00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:42.967
<i>You know who you are,
and you know kind of all about yourself.</i>

12
00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:47.640
<i>But just for day-to-day stuff,
notes are really useful.</i>

13
00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.435
<i>Sammy Jankis had the same problem…</i>

14
00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.479
<i>but he really had no system.</i>

15
00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:55.940
<i>He wrote himself
a ridiculous amount of notes…</i>

16
00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:57.942
<i>but he’d get them all mixed up.</i>

17
00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:02.278
<i>You really do need a system
if you’re gonna make it work.</i>

18
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.451
<i>You really need a system
if you’re gonna make it work.</i>

19
00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.579
<i>You kind of learn
to trust your own handwriting.</i>

20
00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:14.709
<i>That becomes an important part of your life.
You write yourself notes.</i>

21
00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:17.128
<i>Where you put your notes—
That also becomes important.</i>

22
00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.797
<i>You need a jacket that’s got
like six pockets in it.</i>

23
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.091
<i>Particular pockets for particular things.</i>

24
00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:26.012
<i>You just kind of learn to know
where things go and how the system works.</i>

25
00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:30.141
<i>And you have to be wary of other people writing
stuff for you that is not gonna make sense…</i>

26
00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:32.184
<i>or is gonna lead you astray.</i>

27
00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:35.563
<i>I don’t know. I guess people try and take
advantage of somebody with this condition.</i>

28
00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:41.736
<i>If you have a piece
of information which is vital…</i>

29
00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.239
<i>writing on your body instead of
on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i>

30
00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:47.616
<i>It’s just a permanent way of keeping a note.</i>

31
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.314
Who is this?

32
00:04:57.794 --> 00:04:59.962
You said we talked before.
I don’t remember that.

33
00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:03.549
Yeah, but it’s not amnesia.
I remember everything up until my injury.

34
00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:06.344
I just can’t make new memories.
So I can’t remember talking to you.

35
00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:09.388
What did we talk about? Oh, Sammy Jankis.

36
00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:11.808
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

37
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:14.644
Sammy’s story helps me
understand my own situation.

38
00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:19.857
Sammy wrote himself endless
amounts of notes, but he got mixed up.

39
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.319
I have a more graceful
solution to the memory problem.

40
00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:29.116
I’m disciplined and organized.

41
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.744
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

42
00:05:32.912 --> 00:05:35.163
Sammy had no drive, no reason to make it work.

43
00:05:36.624 --> 00:05:40.837
Me? Yeah, I got a reason.

44
00:05:43.522 --> 00:05:47.260
I met Sammy through work.
Insurance. I was an investigator.

45
00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:50.221
I’d investigate the claims
to see which ones were phony.

46
00:05:50.304 --> 00:05:52.390
I had to see through people’s bullshit.

47
00:05:52.473 --> 00:05:55.268
It was useful experience,
’cause now it’s my life.

48
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:58.187
When I meet someone,
I don’t know if I’ve met them before.

49
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.190
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

50
00:06:01.274 --> 00:06:04.569
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out
what someone knew was just let them talk…</i>

51
00:06:04.652 --> 00:06:07.028
<i>and watch the eyes and the body language.</i>

52
00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:10.700
<i>If someone scratches their nose while they’re
talking, experts tell you it means they’re lying.</i>

53
00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:14.287
<i>It really means they’re nervous.
People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

54
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:15.580
<i>It’s all about context.</i>

55
00:06:15.663 --> 00:06:17.540
Yeah, I was good.

56
00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:20.626
Sammy was my first real challenge.

57
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.298
I’d just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

58
00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:29.093
Mr. Samuel R. Jankis. Strangest case ever.

59
00:06:29.177 --> 00:06:31.971
You know, the guy’s a 58-year-old
semiretired accountant.

60
00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:34.724
He and his wife had been in this car accident.
Nothing too serious.

61
00:06:34.807 --> 00:06:38.019
<i>But he’s acting funny.
He can’t get a handle on what’s going on.</i>

62
00:06:39.478 --> 00:06:42.273
<i>The doctors find some possible damage
to the hippocampus.</i>

63
00:06:42.356 --> 00:06:46.903
<i>Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can’t remember
anything for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

64
00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:49.739
<i>Can’t work, can’t do shit.
The medical bills pile up.</i>

65
00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:52.533
<i>His wife calls the insurance company,
and I get sent in.</i>

66
00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:57.495
<i>Now, this is my first big claims investigation,
so I really check into it.</i>

67
00:06:58.164 --> 00:07:02.792
<i>Sammy can think just fine,
but he can’t make any new memories.</i>

68
00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:05.213
<i>He could only remember things
for a couple of minutes.</i>

69
00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:07.006
– This is Mr. Shelby.
<i>– He’d watch TV…</i>

70
00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.425
<i>but anything longer than
a couple of minutes was too confusing.</i>

71
00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.346
<i>He couldn’t remember how it began.
He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

72
00:07:13.429 --> 00:07:15.515
Sammy. It’s time for my shot.

73
00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:18.476
<i>The crazy part was that this guy…</i>

74
00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:21.771
<i>who couldn’t even follow the plot
of</i> Green Acres <i>anymore…</i>

75
00:07:21.854 --> 00:07:23.940
<i>could do the most complicated things…</i>

76
00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:27.400
<i>as long as he learned them
before the accident…</i>

77
00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.987
<i>and as long as he kept his mind
on what he was doing.</i>

78
00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:32.822
Be gentle.

79
00:07:32.907 --> 00:07:37.203
<i>The doctors assure me there’s a real condition
called anterograde memory loss…</i>

80
00:07:37.286 --> 00:07:39.247
<i>or short-term memory loss.</i>

81
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.331
<i>It’s rare, but legit.</i>

82
00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:45.085
<i>But every time I see him…</i>

83
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.838
<i>I catch this look…</i>

84
00:07:47.922 --> 00:07:51.509
<i>this slight look of recognition.</i>

85
00:07:52.134 --> 00:07:54.428
<i>But he says he can’t remember me at all.</i>

86
00:07:54.512 --> 00:07:56.638
Sammy, it’s okay. I got it. I got it.

87
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:59.557
– Hi, Mr. Shelby.
– Hi, Mrs. Jankis.

88
00:07:59.642 --> 00:08:03.604
<i>I can read people,
and I’m thinking: bad actor.</i>

89
00:08:04.313 --> 00:08:07.130
So now I’m suspicious, and I order more tests.

90
00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:10.153
Sammy couldn’t pick up any new skills at all.

91
00:08:10.987 --> 00:08:14.574
But I find something
in my research: conditioning.

92
00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:17.660
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

93
00:08:17.743 --> 00:08:21.163
It’s how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You just get better through practice.

94
00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:23.748
It’s a completely different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

95
00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:26.919
So I had the doctors test
Sammy’s response to conditioning.

96
00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:29.172
Just pick up any three objects.

97
00:08:29.255 --> 00:08:31.424
That’s a test?

98
00:08:31.507 --> 00:08:34.093
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

99
00:08:35.178 --> 00:08:36.345
Sorry.

100
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:42.143
Ow! What the fuck?

101
00:08:42.226 --> 00:08:45.438
– It’s a test, Sammy.
– Test this, you fucking quack.

102
00:08:46.772 --> 00:08:48.941
<i>Some of the objects were electrified.</i>

103
00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:51.401
<i>They’d give him a small shock.
They kept repeating the test…</i>

104
00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.446
always with the same objects electrified.

105
00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:57.116
The point was to see if Sammy could learn
to avoid the electrified objects…

106
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.201
not by memory, but by instinct.

107
00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:03.248
They kept testing Sammy for months…

108
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.126
always with the same objects
carrying the electrical charge.

109
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.962
Ow! What the fuck?

110
00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:11.464
– It’s a test, Sammy.
– Test this, you fucking quack!

111
00:09:11.548 --> 00:09:14.259
Even with total short-term memory loss…

112
00:09:14.342 --> 00:09:17.095
<i>Sammy should have learned to instinctively stop
picking up the wrong objects.</i>

113
00:09:17.179 --> 00:09:21.224
<i>All the previous cases responded to conditioning.
Sammy didn’t respond at all.</i>

114
00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:24.895
<i>It was enough to suggest that his condition
was psychological, not physical.</i>

115
00:09:24.978 --> 00:09:28.440
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn’t covered for mental illness.

116
00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:32.235
His wife got stuck with the bills,
and I got a big promotion.

117
00:09:34.112 --> 00:09:37.616
Conditioning didn’t work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

118
00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:39.618
But it works for me.

119
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.078
I live the way Sammy couldn’t.

120
00:09:42.162 --> 00:09:44.581
Habit and routine make my life possible.

121
00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:47.584
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

122
00:09:49.544 --> 00:09:52.589
Sammy’s wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him…

123
00:09:52.672 --> 00:09:54.758
and fighting the company’s decision.

124
00:09:56.635 --> 00:09:58.929
But it wasn’t the money that got to her.

125
00:09:59.012 --> 00:10:02.015
<i>– I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>
– Listen. I have an idea.

126
00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:03.724
Sammy, I have an idea.

127
00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:06.478
<i>Just that his problem was mental, not physical.</i>

128
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:09.815
I want you to have a pen in your pocket, okay?

129
00:10:09.898 --> 00:10:12.442
<i>– But she couldn’t understand.</i>
– You’re gonna have a pad in your pocket.

130
00:10:12.526 --> 00:10:14.527
– I did something wrong?
– You did something wrong!

131
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.739
We’re gonna deal with it.
We’re gonna try harder.

132
00:10:17.823 --> 00:10:19.949
<i>She looks into his eyes
and sees the same person.</i>

133
00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:23.161
<i>If it’s not a physical problem,
he should just snap out of it.</i>

134
00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:24.955
– Ellen called!
– Ellen called?

135
00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:29.668
– Ellen can’t come today! Ellen can’t come!
– Okay. I’m sorry!

136
00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:32.879
– I’m sorry. I’m trying. I’m sorry.
– Try harder!

137
00:10:36.633 --> 00:10:40.761
So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance
company gives her the seed of doubt…

138
00:10:41.346 --> 00:10:43.472
just like he gave it to the doctors.

139
00:10:44.266 --> 00:10:46.977
But I never said that he was faking.
I never said that.

140
00:10:52.566 --> 00:10:56.236
What Mrs. Jankis didn’t understand was
that you can’t bully someone into remembering.

141
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.321
The more pressure you’re under,
the harder it gets.

142
00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:03.075
Then call me back?

143
00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:44.243
Who is this?

144
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:47.204
Yeah.

145
00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:48.997
Uh-huh.

146
00:11:50.832 --> 00:11:53.960
Sir, that’d certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

147
00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:57.923
I was hoping for a little more on the drugs angle.
Can you hang on a sec?

148
00:12:06.515 --> 00:12:09.768
The police report mentioned
the drugs found in the car outside my house.

149
00:12:09.851 --> 00:12:11.937
The car was stolen,
but his prints were all over it.

150
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.731
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy of it.

151
00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:17.109
I dealt with the police a lot
in my insurance job.

152
00:12:17.192 --> 00:12:21.278
With my condition, it’s really tough.
I can’t keep it all in mind at once.

153
00:12:21.363 --> 00:12:24.616
I have to summarize the different sections.
And there’s pages missing.

154
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.868
I guess I’ve been trying to log them all.

155
00:12:26.952 --> 00:12:29.203
I don’t know why these are crossed out.

156
00:12:29.287 --> 00:12:31.206
But they weren’t even looking for John G.

157
00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:34.042
The stuff they found in the car fit in with
what they believed had happened…

158
00:12:34.126 --> 00:12:36.044
so they didn’t chase any of it up.

159
00:12:38.505 --> 00:12:41.550
There’s something about the drugs stashed
in the car that doesn’t ring true for me.

160
00:12:42.217 --> 00:12:44.136
Because the police claim
the guy was an addict…

161
00:12:44.219 --> 00:12:46.220
needing money to score,
which I think is bullshit…

162
00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:49.558
’cause he’s not gonna go breaking into places
while he’s still got a stash that big.

163
00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:53.186
I think John G. left it there
or planted it there.

164
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:57.022
How do you know that?

165
00:12:58.483 --> 00:13:00.484
Shit. That’s true. It fits.

166
00:13:01.194 --> 00:13:03.155
So he’s a dealer.

167
00:13:03.822 --> 00:13:05.740
Hang on a sec.

168
00:13:15.876 --> 00:13:17.731
Now we’re getting somewhere.

169
00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:21.423
I can’t blame the cops
for not taking me seriously.

170
00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:23.842
This is a difficult condition
for people to understand.

171
00:13:23.925 --> 00:13:27.178
Look at Sammy Jankis.
His own wife couldn’t deal with it.

172
00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:29.806
I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out of it.

173
00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:33.226
Eventually she came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

174
00:13:33.727 --> 00:13:36.187
<i>She told me about life with Sammy,
how she treated him.</i>

175
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:37.730
Thank you for seeing me.

176
00:13:37.814 --> 00:13:40.567
It got to the point where she’d get Sammy
to hide food all around the house.

177
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.402
Then she’d stop feeding him
to see if his hunger…

178
00:13:42.485 --> 00:13:44.446
would make him remember
where he’d hidden the food.

179
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:49.409
<i>She wasn’t a cruel person.
She just wanted old Sammy back.</i>

180
00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:53.287
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you’ve decided that he’s faking.

181
00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:55.999
Mrs. Jankis, the company’s position
isn’t that Sammy is faking anything…

182
00:13:56.082 --> 00:13:58.001
just that his condition can’t be shown to be—

183
00:13:58.084 --> 00:14:01.546
I just want to know
what your honest opinion about Sammy is.

184
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:04.549
We shouldn’t even be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

185
00:14:04.632 --> 00:14:07.886
– I’m not appealing the decision.
– Then why are you here?

186
00:14:07.969 --> 00:14:10.430
Try to understand.
When I look at Sammy…

187
00:14:10.513 --> 00:14:13.975
I don’t see some… vegetable.

188
00:14:14.058 --> 00:14:16.144
I see my same old Sammy.

189
00:14:18.313 --> 00:14:22.734
What do you think that’s like for me to suspect
he might be imagining this whole problem…

190
00:14:22.817 --> 00:14:24.903
and that if I just could say the right thing…

191
00:14:24.986 --> 00:14:27.780
he’d snap out of it
and go back to being normal?

192
00:14:33.328 --> 00:14:37.123
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone…

193
00:14:37.207 --> 00:14:41.335
then I could say good-bye
and start loving this new Sammy.

194
00:14:43.338 --> 00:14:46.174
As long as I have doubt,
I can’t say good-bye and move on.

195
00:14:46.257 --> 00:14:48.009
What do you want from me?

196
00:14:48.092 --> 00:14:51.262
I want you to forget the company
you work for 30 seconds…

197
00:14:51.346 --> 00:14:55.016
and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy’s faking his condition.

198
00:14:56.184 --> 00:15:00.270
I need to know… what you honestly believe.

199
00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.197
I believe that Sammy should be physically
capable of making new memories.

200
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:18.206
Thank you.

201
00:15:20.875 --> 00:15:23.795
I thought I helped her. I thought
she just needed some kind of answer.

202
00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:25.879
I didn’t think it was important
what the answer was…

203
00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:28.715
just that she had one to believe.

204
00:15:36.224 --> 00:15:39.143
No. She shouldn’t have
given me that responsibility.

205
00:15:39.227 --> 00:15:41.896
I’m a claims investigator, not a doctor.

206
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:45.524
Yeah. I guess.

207
00:15:45.608 --> 00:15:47.984
But I’ve got all sorts of other considerations.

208
00:15:48.778 --> 00:15:51.279
Legal responsibility, large financial—

209
00:15:56.077 --> 00:15:57.745
Who is this?

210
00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:26.731
Front desk?

211
00:16:26.815 --> 00:16:29.401
Burt. Right.
This is Mr. Shelby in room 21.

212
00:16:30.236 --> 00:16:32.571
Yeah, that’s the thing. I don’t want any calls.

213
00:16:32.655 --> 00:16:34.635
Nope. None at all.

214
00:16:44.917 --> 00:16:45.960
Hello?

215
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.799
It’s Burt, from the front desk.

216
00:16:54.093 --> 00:16:56.471
– Yeah?
– I know you said you didn’t want any calls.

217
00:16:56.554 --> 00:16:59.098
But this guy called.
He’s on the phone now. He says he’s a cop.

218
00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:00.641
– A cop?
– Yeah.

219
00:17:00.725 --> 00:17:04.270
He says you’re really gonna wanna
know what he has to say.

220
00:17:04.353 --> 00:17:07.940
I’m not too good on the phone. I need to look
people in the eye when I talk to them.

221
00:17:59.743 --> 00:18:01.787
Why are you calling me? What do you want?

222
00:18:02.538 --> 00:18:05.332
I know you’re a cop, but what do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

223
00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.376
I don’t know. Something bad, maybe.

224
00:18:10.963 --> 00:18:14.842
Why are you asking me? I can’t remember
what I’ve done. You wouldn’t believe me anyway.

225
00:18:14.925 --> 00:18:17.845
Because of my condition.
You don’t believe someone with this condition.

226
00:18:17.928 --> 00:18:20.824
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn’t even fucking believe Sammy!

227
00:18:22.224 --> 00:18:24.600
It’s completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

228
00:18:25.811 --> 00:18:29.064
It’s amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

229
00:18:29.147 --> 00:18:31.942
I guess it’s some kind of poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

230
00:18:32.025 --> 00:18:34.194
You know the truth about my condition, Officer?

231
00:18:35.028 --> 00:18:37.029
You don’t know anything.

232
00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:39.283
You feel angry, you don’t know why.

233
00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:42.119
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

234
00:18:42.953 --> 00:18:45.581
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea 10 minutes later.

235
00:18:45.664 --> 00:18:48.040
Like Sammy.
What if I’ve done something like Sammy?

236
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.004
I didn’t tell you what happened
to Sammy and his wife?

237
00:18:53.755 --> 00:18:56.925
She came to see me at my office. I thought
she was trying to catch me off guard…

238
00:18:57.009 --> 00:18:59.928
<i>so I didn’t tell her what I really thought,
but I never said that he was faking…</i>

239
00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:01.930
<i>just that his condition was mental,
not physical.</i>

240
00:19:02.014 --> 00:19:04.975
<i>I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.</i>

241
00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:09.646
Sammy? It’s time for my shot.

242
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:27.621
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her.</i>

243
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.751
<i>So she found a way to test him.</i>

244
00:19:43.472 --> 00:19:47.059
Sammy. It’s time for my shot.

245
00:19:57.027 --> 00:19:59.071
<i>She really thought she’d call his bluff.</i>

246
00:19:59.154 --> 00:20:00.654
There you go.

247
00:20:01.239 --> 00:20:05.077
<i>Or she just didn’t wanna live
with the things she’d put him through.</i>

248
00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:16.045
Sammy.

249
00:20:18.215 --> 00:20:20.341
It’s time for my shot.

250
00:20:25.806 --> 00:20:27.599
It won’t hurt.

251
00:21:11.727 --> 00:21:13.770
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.</i>

252
00:21:14.938 --> 00:21:18.024
<i>Sammy couldn’t understand
or explain what happened.</i>

253
00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:22.237
He’s been in a home ever since.

254
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.739
<i>He doesn’t even know that his wife is dead.</i>

255
00:21:24.823 --> 00:21:28.201
I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.

256
00:21:28.285 --> 00:21:30.203
She wasn’t interested in the money.

257
00:21:30.287 --> 00:21:32.456
She just needed to understand his problem.

258
00:21:32.539 --> 00:21:35.959
<i>His brain didn’t respond to conditioning.
But he wasn’t a con man.</i>

259
00:21:36.042 --> 00:21:39.462
<i>When she looked into his eyes,
she thought he could be the same person.</i>

260
00:21:39.546 --> 00:21:41.922
<i>When I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.</i>

261
00:21:42.007 --> 00:21:44.133
Now I know. You fake it.

262
00:21:44.217 --> 00:21:47.053
If you think you’re supposed to
recognize somebody, you just pretend to.

263
00:21:47.137 --> 00:21:49.806
<i>You bluff it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.</i>

264
00:21:50.432 --> 00:21:52.683
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

265
00:21:56.313 --> 00:21:57.958
What drug dealer?

266
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:02.819
So this Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar
where his girlfriend works?

267
00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:06.156
But he’s not gonna bring her along.
He’ll come by himself, right?

268
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.451
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

269
00:22:11.494 --> 00:22:14.664
No, Officer. I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.

270
00:22:15.373 --> 00:22:17.917
You’re in the lobby? What do you look like?

271
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.171
I’ll be right there.

272
00:23:03.296 --> 00:23:04.214
Lenny.

273
00:23:07.342 --> 00:23:08.551
Officer Gammell.

274
00:23:11.095 --> 00:23:13.806
Yeah. Come on.

275
00:23:30.323 --> 00:23:32.784
– Smile.
– Not here.

276
00:23:34.118 --> 00:23:35.411
Over here.

277
00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:44.087
– Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?
– You know what?

278
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.381
Don’t write Gammell, just Teddy.

279
00:23:47.048 --> 00:23:49.092
– Why?
– I’m undercover.

280
00:23:51.928 --> 00:23:54.347
This is the directions where he’s going.

281
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.475
– My number’s on the bottom if you need me.
– You’re not coming?

282
00:23:57.559 --> 00:23:59.477
No. It wouldn’t be appropriate.

283
00:24:04.023 --> 00:24:07.110
Nice picture. I look thin.

284
00:24:10.822 --> 00:24:12.115
Hey, Lenny.

285
00:24:12.782 --> 00:24:14.200
Make him beg.

286
00:25:37.283 --> 00:25:38.533
Teddy!

287
00:25:41.746 --> 00:25:43.246
Hey, Teddy!

288
00:25:50.213 --> 00:25:51.381
Jimmy.

289
00:25:53.174 --> 00:25:55.760
– What the fuck are you doing here?
– You Jimmy Grants?

290
00:25:55.843 --> 00:25:57.844
Expecting any other Jimmys out here,
Memory Man?

291
00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:02.182
– Do you remember me?
– Yeah, I remember you.

292
00:26:02.266 --> 00:26:04.685
Where the fuck’s Teddy?

293
00:26:04.769 --> 00:26:05.478
Well?

294
00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:12.402
Motherfuck— Fuckin’ retard!

295
00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:17.573
– Strip.
– You’re making a big fucking mistake, pal.

296
00:26:17.657 --> 00:26:18.950
Strip!

297
00:26:21.035 --> 00:26:23.621
My associates are not
the kind of people you wanna piss off.

298
00:26:23.704 --> 00:26:25.289
Don’t say anything else.

299
00:26:25.373 --> 00:26:27.792
– I knew I couldn’t trust that fuck!
– Take it off.

300
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.963
Cocksucker.

301
00:26:33.047 --> 00:26:34.841
Your pants too.

302
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.760
– Why?
– I don’t wanna get blood on them.

303
00:26:39.846 --> 00:26:41.847
Wait. Did he tell you what I was bringing?

304
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:45.851
– Take your fuckin’ pants off!
– I’ve got 200 grand stashed in the car!

305
00:26:45.935 --> 00:26:48.646
– Just take it!
– You think you can bargain with me?

306
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.106
– Take the money and walk away!
– I don’t want your fuckin’ money.

307
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:53.609
Then what?

308
00:26:54.152 --> 00:26:57.822
– What do you want from me?
– I want my fuckin’ life back!

309
00:28:28.412 --> 00:28:29.622
Sammy.

310
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:38.464
He said “Sammy.”
How does he know about Sammy?

311
00:28:38.548 --> 00:28:39.923
Oh, fuck.

312
00:29:00.528 --> 00:29:02.529
What have I done?

313
00:29:04.407 --> 00:29:07.118
Mister, I need help.
There’s a guy in here, he’s hurt bad.

314
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:09.452
– We gotta get him to a doctor.
– All right.

315
00:29:11.247 --> 00:29:13.541
I don’t know what happened.
I’ve got this memory thing.

316
00:29:13.624 --> 00:29:15.835
– Do I know you?
– No. Don’t worry. I’m a cop.

317
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:19.463
– Is he still breathing?
– I don’t know. Maybe.

318
00:29:19.547 --> 00:29:22.091
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

319
00:29:23.634 --> 00:29:25.720
I don’t remember. I have this condition.

320
00:29:25.803 --> 00:29:28.514
I hope it’s not as serious as his,
’cause this guy’s dead.

321
00:29:28.598 --> 00:29:31.142
Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!

322
00:29:31.225 --> 00:29:34.770
So you remember me now, huh?
You are a fuckin’ cop.

323
00:29:34.854 --> 00:29:37.690
Yeah. And I’m the guy
that helped you find him.

324
00:29:37.773 --> 00:29:39.650
Get up. Get up.

325
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.777
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

326
00:29:44.488 --> 00:29:46.532
Who is that? He knew me.

327
00:29:46.616 --> 00:29:49.242
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

328
00:29:49.327 --> 00:29:51.370
Bullshit. He’s not the guy.

329
00:29:51.454 --> 00:29:55.791
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.

330
00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.294
– What was he bringing the 200 grand for?
– What?

331
00:29:59.879 --> 00:30:02.673
– What was it for?
– A load of amphetamines I told him I had.

332
00:30:02.757 --> 00:30:06.218
– Is this a drug deal?
– No. Yeah, that and your thing.

333
00:30:06.302 --> 00:30:09.930
Look, Leonard, Jimmy’s your guy. I just
figured we’d make a few dollars on the side.

334
00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:13.643
– How did he know me?
– The Discount Inn. He dealt out of there.

335
00:30:13.726 --> 00:30:17.021
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

336
00:30:17.104 --> 00:30:19.649
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump.

337
00:30:19.732 --> 00:30:22.108
– You’re fucking using me.
– No! You get half!

338
00:30:22.193 --> 00:30:24.819
He knew about Sammy!
Why would I tell him about fuckin’ Sammy?

339
00:30:24.904 --> 00:30:28.282
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who’ll listen.

340
00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:30.492
“Remember Sammy Jankis?”
“Remember Sammy Jankis?”

341
00:30:30.576 --> 00:30:33.496
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

342
00:30:34.455 --> 00:30:36.374
So you lie to yourself to be happy.

343
00:30:36.457 --> 00:30:38.501
There’s nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

344
00:30:38.584 --> 00:30:41.712
Who cares if there’s a few little details
you’d rather not remember?

345
00:30:44.173 --> 00:30:46.509
– What the fuck are you talking about?
– I don’t know.

346
00:30:47.301 --> 00:30:49.220
Your wife surviving the assault.

347
00:30:50.012 --> 00:30:51.931
Her not believing your condition.

348
00:30:52.014 --> 00:30:56.185
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

349
00:30:56.769 --> 00:30:58.062
The insulin.

350
00:30:59.355 --> 00:31:02.066
That’s Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

351
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:05.152
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

352
00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:07.237
Conditioning yourself to remember.

353
00:31:07.321 --> 00:31:09.907
– Learning through repetition.
– Sammy let his wife kill herself.

354
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:15.037
– Sammy ended up in an institution.
– Sammy was a con man, a faker.

355
00:31:15.121 --> 00:31:17.289
I never said that Sammy was faking.

356
00:31:17.873 --> 00:31:20.334
You exposed him for what he was— a fraud.

357
00:31:20.418 --> 00:31:22.378
But I was wrong. That’s the whole point.

358
00:31:24.046 --> 00:31:26.799
– See, Sammy’s wife came to me.
– Sammy didn’t have a wife.

359
00:31:29.552 --> 00:31:31.887
It was <i>your</i> wife who had diabetes.

360
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:39.269
Ouch.

361
00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:43.566
My wife wasn’t diabetic.

362
00:31:44.567 --> 00:31:45.985
You sure?

363
00:31:50.781 --> 00:31:53.909
– Ouch. Cut it out.
– She wasn’t diabetic.

364
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.705
You think I don’t know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

365
00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:02.209
I guess I can only make you remember
the things you wanna be true.

366
00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:04.669
– Like old Jimmy down there.
– He’s not the right guy.

367
00:32:04.754 --> 00:32:06.922
He was to you.

368
00:32:07.006 --> 00:32:10.426
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

369
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:13.012
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

370
00:32:13.095 --> 00:32:15.723
– It makes all the difference.
– Why? You’re never gonna know.

371
00:32:15.806 --> 00:32:17.099
– Yes, I will.
– No, you won’t.

372
00:32:17.183 --> 00:32:18.642
I will. Somehow I’ll know.

373
00:32:18.726 --> 00:32:21.145
– You won’t remember!
– When it’s done, I will know. It’ll be different.

374
00:32:21.228 --> 00:32:25.148
I thought so too.
In fact, I was sure of it, but you didn’t!

375
00:32:27.943 --> 00:32:31.197
That’s right. The real John G.

376
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.867
I helped you find him over a year ago.
He’s already dead.

377
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.828
– Don’t lie to me anymore.
– Look, Lenny.

378
00:32:38.454 --> 00:32:41.332
I was the cop assigned to your wife’s case.
I believed you.

379
00:32:41.415 --> 00:32:43.959
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

380
00:32:44.043 --> 00:32:47.338
I’m the one that helped you find the other guy
in your bathroom that night…

381
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.757
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

382
00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.301
We found him. You killed him.

383
00:32:53.969 --> 00:32:59.308
But you didn’t remember.
So I helped you start looking again…

384
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:01.644
looking for the guy you already killed.

385
00:33:02.186 --> 00:33:03.938
Yeah? So who was he?

386
00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:06.397
Just some guy. Does it even matter who?

387
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:11.028
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.

388
00:33:12.238 --> 00:33:15.991
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn’t live alone.

389
00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:20.954
But when you killed him,
I was so convinced that you’d remember.

390
00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:23.499
But it didn’t stick.

391
00:33:23.582 --> 00:33:26.335
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won’t stick.

392
00:33:31.006 --> 00:33:35.636
I took that picture… just when you did it.

393
00:33:37.638 --> 00:33:39.557
Look how happy you are.

394
00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:42.643
I wanted to see that face again.

395
00:33:42.726 --> 00:33:45.521
– Gee, thanks.
– Fuck you.

396
00:33:45.604 --> 00:33:49.358
I gave you a reason to live,
and you were more than happy to help.

397
00:33:49.441 --> 00:33:53.612
You don’t want the truth.
You make up your own truth.

398
00:33:53.696 --> 00:33:55.656
Like your police file.

399
00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.493
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

400
00:33:59.577 --> 00:34:02.121
– You, probably.
– No, it wasn’t me. See, it was you.

401
00:34:02.204 --> 00:34:05.916
– Why would I do that?
– To create a puzzle you could never solve.

402
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.918
You know how many towns?

403
00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:10.171
How many John G.’s or James G.’s?

404
00:34:10.254 --> 00:34:12.298
Shit, Lenny. I’m a fucking John G.

405
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:15.634
– Your name is Teddy.
– My mother calls me Teddy.

406
00:34:15.718 --> 00:34:18.596
My name’s John Edward Gammell.

407
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:19.722
Cheer up.

408
00:34:19.805 --> 00:34:22.558
There’s plenty of John G.’s for us to find.

409
00:34:25.936 --> 00:34:28.355
All you do is moan.

410
00:34:28.439 --> 00:34:30.774
I’m the one that has to live
with what you’ve done.

411
00:34:30.858 --> 00:34:32.568
I’m the one that put it all together.

412
00:34:32.651 --> 00:34:37.323
You wander around, you’re playing detective.
You’re living a dream, kid.

413
00:34:37.406 --> 00:34:41.492
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

414
00:34:41.577 --> 00:34:44.914
A romantic quest that you wouldn’t end
even if I wasn’t in the picture.

415
00:34:46.207 --> 00:34:49.376
– I should kill you.
– Quit it. Lenny, come on.

416
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.463
You’re not a killer.
That’s why you’re so good at it.

417
00:34:56.008 --> 00:34:58.761
What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

418
00:34:58.844 --> 00:35:00.930
It’s beer o’clock. I’m buying.

419
00:35:02.932 --> 00:35:04.057
Fuck.

420
00:35:14.151 --> 00:35:15.276
I’m not a killer.

421
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.114
I’m just someone who wanted
to make things right.

422
00:35:25.162 --> 00:35:27.538
Can I just let myself forget
what you’ve told me?

423
00:35:44.765 --> 00:35:48.143
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

424
00:36:02.408 --> 00:36:04.158
You think I just want another puzzle to solve?

425
00:36:04.994 --> 00:36:07.162
Another John G. to look for?

426
00:36:08.372 --> 00:36:10.249
You’re a John G.

427
00:36:11.959 --> 00:36:14.044
So you can be my John G.

428
00:36:22.511 --> 00:36:24.637
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

429
00:36:25.931 --> 00:36:27.683
In your case, Teddy…

430
00:36:28.809 --> 00:36:30.728
yes, I will.

431
00:36:43.866 --> 00:36:45.951
Hey, that’s not your car!

432
00:36:46.035 --> 00:36:48.620
– It is now.
– Jesus Christ, you can’t take it!

433
00:36:48.704 --> 00:36:51.623
– Why not?
– Because the guy you just killed owns it!

434
00:36:51.707 --> 00:36:53.417
Somebody’ll recognize it!

435
00:36:54.877 --> 00:36:57.963
I think I’d rather be mistaken
for a dead guy than a killer.

436
00:36:58.922 --> 00:37:01.425
I might hang on to this for a while.

437
00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:03.552
Lenny.

438
00:37:05.596 --> 00:37:08.097
Will you help me find the keys?

439
00:37:08.182 --> 00:37:09.932
Help me find my keys.

440
00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:35.501
I have to believe in a world
outside my own mind.

441
00:37:35.584 --> 00:37:37.753
I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning…

442
00:37:37.836 --> 00:37:39.797
even if I can’t remember them.

443
00:37:41.965 --> 00:37:44.635
I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed…

444
00:37:44.718 --> 00:37:46.804
the world’s still here.

445
00:37:48.013 --> 00:37:50.432
Do I believe the world’s still here?

446
00:37:53.352 --> 00:37:54.937
Is it still out there?

447
00:37:58.774 --> 00:37:59.774
Yeah.

448
00:38:02.152 --> 00:38:04.947
We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.

449
00:38:07.282 --> 00:38:08.992
I’m no different.

450
00:38:22.297 --> 00:38:24.091
Now, where was I?

451
00:38:50.324 --> 00:38:53.452
– Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
– It’s private back here.

452
00:38:53.536 --> 00:38:56.539
– It’s okay. We know each other. Right, kid?
– How did you know I was in here?

453
00:38:56.622 --> 00:38:58.623
The Jag’s out front.
Should have put it around back.

454
00:38:58.707 --> 00:39:02.211
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There’s plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

455
00:39:02.294 --> 00:39:04.797
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

456
00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:07.341
– Give me the keys. I’ll move it.
– It’ll be all right for a minute.

457
00:39:07.425 --> 00:39:08.925
Wait out there.

458
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.346
Give me a minute.
I gotta get something for you.

459
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:20.146
Fact six: Car license SG137IU.

460
00:39:26.193 --> 00:39:28.446
Look. Wait a minute, will ya?

461
00:39:31.949 --> 00:39:33.993
– We gotta get you out of here.
– Why?

462
00:39:34.076 --> 00:39:37.371
Man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

463
00:39:37.455 --> 00:39:39.831
– It’s not safe for you to hang around here anymore.
– Why not?

464
00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:41.834
Because that cop’s looking for you.

465
00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:44.503
I gotta get you a new identity,
some new clothes.

466
00:39:44.587 --> 00:39:47.213
A different car would do for now.
So put these on.

467
00:39:47.298 --> 00:39:48.673
What cop?

468
00:39:49.884 --> 00:39:52.845
He’s a bad cop. He’s the one
that checked you into the Discount Inn.

469
00:39:52.928 --> 00:39:56.765
He’s been calling you for days, telling you shit,
slipping envelopes under your door. Shit like that.

470
00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:59.560
– How do you know this?
– He told me. He thinks it’s funny.

471
00:39:59.643 --> 00:40:01.644
– He’s been laughing at you.
– You’re full of shit.

472
00:40:01.729 --> 00:40:04.565
I’m not. He knows you’re no good on the phone,
so he’s been calling you.

473
00:40:04.648 --> 00:40:06.649
Sometimes you don’t answer the phone…

474
00:40:06.734 --> 00:40:09.528
so he slips shit under your door to scare you
into answering the phone again…

475
00:40:09.612 --> 00:40:12.281
giving you a line of crap about John G.
being some local drug dealer.

476
00:40:12.364 --> 00:40:15.618
– Jimmy Grants.
– Who’s Jimmy Grants?

477
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:17.661
Leonard, Jimmy’s the drug dealer.

478
00:40:17.745 --> 00:40:20.039
The cop wants to know how his operation’s run.

479
00:40:20.122 --> 00:40:22.123
He’s got some score in mind.
Somehow you’re involved.

480
00:40:22.208 --> 00:40:23.876
Uh-huh. How do you know him?

481
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.673
I’m a snitch. He’s a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

482
00:40:29.757 --> 00:40:32.092
If he knew I was helping you,
he’d fucking kill me.

483
00:40:32.176 --> 00:40:35.971
So take these clothes, put them on
and get the fuck out of here.

484
00:40:36.055 --> 00:40:38.681
Come on, Leonard. Just go.

485
00:40:59.328 --> 00:41:01.288
You are full of shit.

486
00:41:02.998 --> 00:41:05.167
“Come by after. Natalie.”

487
00:41:05.251 --> 00:41:06.751
“Ferdy’s Bar.”

488
00:41:49.587 --> 00:41:50.921
Hey, Jimmy.

489
00:41:53.966 --> 00:41:56.760
I’m sorry.
I thought you were somebody else.

490
00:41:57.428 --> 00:41:58.762
Sorry.

491
00:41:59.597 --> 00:42:00.847
That’s okay.

492
00:42:15.236 --> 00:42:16.988
“Ferdy’s Bar.”

493
00:42:19.282 --> 00:42:21.951
“Come by after. Natalie.”

494
00:42:36.132 --> 00:42:37.842
I’ll have a beer, please.

495
00:42:37.926 --> 00:42:39.927
– What do you want?
– A beer, please.

496
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:42.430
You can’t just waltz in here
dressed like that and ask for a beer.

497
00:42:42.513 --> 00:42:44.849
– What, is there a dress code?
– Why are you here?

498
00:42:44.933 --> 00:42:47.894
– I’m meeting someone called Natalie.
– That’s me.

499
00:42:47.977 --> 00:42:50.188
Yeah. We met before, right?

500
00:42:51.564 --> 00:42:53.815
– Then why am I here?
– I don’t know. Why don’t you tell me.

501
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.361
I don’t remember. I have no short-term memory.
It’s not amnesia.

502
00:42:56.444 --> 00:42:59.113
– You’re the memory guy.
– How do you know about me?

503
00:42:59.948 --> 00:43:01.658
My boyfriend told me about you.

504
00:43:01.741 --> 00:43:05.661
– Yeah? Who’s your boyfriend?
– Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

505
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:08.289
No.

506
00:43:08.373 --> 00:43:11.834
He knows you. He told me about you.

507
00:43:11.918 --> 00:43:14.003
He said you were staying at the Discount.

508
00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:17.131
In fact, a cop came by earlier,
was looking for you.

509
00:43:17.215 --> 00:43:19.384
Said he was looking for a guy
who can’t remember anything…

510
00:43:19.467 --> 00:43:21.803
wouldn’t know how he got here
or what he’d done.

511
00:43:21.886 --> 00:43:24.430
Said I get a lot of guys around here like that.

512
00:43:24.514 --> 00:43:27.976
Chronic alcoholism is one cause
of short-term memory loss.

513
00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:32.772
– Are you Teddy?
– No. My name’s Leonard.

514
00:43:32.855 --> 00:43:34.983
– Did Teddy send you?
– I don’t know.

515
00:43:36.567 --> 00:43:39.237
– What’s happened to Jimmy?
– I don’t know that either.

516
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.698
– Sorry.
– You don’t remember anything?

517
00:43:41.781 --> 00:43:45.118
You don’t remember where you’ve been
or what you’ve just done.

518
00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:48.830
No. I can’t make new memories.
Everything just fades.

519
00:43:48.913 --> 00:43:51.624
– Then why did you come here?
– I found this in my pocket.

520
00:43:54.919 --> 00:43:56.421
<i>Your</i> pocket.

521
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.198
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

522
00:44:24.282 --> 00:44:26.617
– No, thanks.
– It’s for a lot of money.

523
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:30.163
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

524
00:44:42.425 --> 00:44:43.718
Thank you.

525
00:45:01.152 --> 00:45:03.237
– On the house.
– Thanks.

526
00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:12.412
– On the house.
– Thanks.

527
00:45:17.918 --> 00:45:19.919
You really do have a problem.

528
00:45:20.588 --> 00:45:22.423
Just like that cop said.

529
00:45:23.924 --> 00:45:25.176
Your condition.

530
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.762
Nobody’s perfect.

531
00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:32.766
What’s the last thing that you do remember?

532
00:45:35.895 --> 00:45:38.021
– My wife.
– That’s sweet.

533
00:45:38.105 --> 00:45:38.981
Dying.

534
00:45:40.399 --> 00:45:42.359
I remember my wife dying.

535
00:45:46.989 --> 00:45:49.033
Let me get you another one.

536
00:45:49.992 --> 00:45:51.952
I think this one’s dusty.

537
00:46:00.127 --> 00:46:03.339
You can crash on the couch.
It’s comfortable.

538
00:46:03.422 --> 00:46:05.216
Just have a seat.

539
00:46:05.299 --> 00:46:06.759
Thanks.

540
00:46:11.722 --> 00:46:13.723
How long do you think it’s gonna take you?

541
00:46:15.643 --> 00:46:18.479
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife?

542
00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:23.192
That depends on if he’s here in town
or if he’s moved on.

543
00:46:23.275 --> 00:46:26.403
I have my file here.

544
00:46:28.739 --> 00:46:32.534
Can I ask you something?
If you have all of that information…

545
00:46:32.618 --> 00:46:34.994
then why haven’t the police
found him for you?

546
00:46:35.913 --> 00:46:38.414
– They’re not looking for him.
– Why not?

547
00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:43.420
They don’t think he exists.
You see, I told them what I remembered.

548
00:46:44.129 --> 00:46:45.631
I was asleep.

549
00:46:46.924 --> 00:46:48.842
Something woke me up.

550
00:46:53.055 --> 00:46:56.767
<i>Her side of the bed was cold.
She’d obviously been out of bed for a while.</i>

551
00:47:55.284 --> 00:47:57.328
There had to be a second man.

552
00:47:58.078 --> 00:47:59.997
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

553
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.999
It’s about the last thing that I do remember.

554
00:48:02.082 --> 00:48:04.835
Look. The police did not believe me.
If we check the police—

555
00:48:04.918 --> 00:48:08.713
How did they explain what you do remember?
The gun and stuff.

556
00:48:12.051 --> 00:48:13.969
John G. was clever.

557
00:48:14.053 --> 00:48:15.553
He was clever.

558
00:48:15.638 --> 00:48:20.351
See, he took the dead man’s gun,
he replaced it with the sap that he hit me with.

559
00:48:20.934 --> 00:48:25.022
He left my gun and he left the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

560
00:48:25.105 --> 00:48:28.859
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man’s hand.

561
00:48:29.902 --> 00:48:31.862
And they only found my gun.

562
00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:34.572
They didn’t need to look for anybody else.

563
00:48:36.241 --> 00:48:39.244
I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts,
and I had brain damage.

564
00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:41.955
The cops are not gonna believe
someone in my condition.

565
00:48:42.039 --> 00:48:46.125
Leonard, you can stay here
for a couple of days if it’ll help you.

566
00:48:48.545 --> 00:48:49.713
Thanks.

567
00:48:49.797 --> 00:48:52.257
I have to go back to work.

568
00:48:52.341 --> 00:48:54.592
So, just make yourself at home.

569
00:48:54.676 --> 00:48:58.514
You can watch TV or you can have some food,
whatever you want, okay?

570
00:48:58.597 --> 00:49:01.266
– Make yourself at home.
– One thing.

571
00:49:04.353 --> 00:49:08.107
– Something to remember you by.
– My name is Natalie.

572
00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:12.486
“Natalie.”

573
00:49:44.726 --> 00:49:46.790
– What’s wrong?
– Somebody’s come already.

574
00:49:56.947 --> 00:49:59.366
– What’s wrong?
– Somebody’s come already.

575
00:49:59.449 --> 00:50:01.410
– Who?
– He calls himself Dodd.

576
00:50:01.493 --> 00:50:02.911
What does he want?

577
00:50:02.995 --> 00:50:05.956
He wants to know what happened to Jimmy
and his money. He thinks I took it.

578
00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:07.164
Did you?

579
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.543
No.

580
00:50:13.422 --> 00:50:15.507
– What’s this all about?
– Fuck!

581
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.469
You don’t have a fucking clue, do you?
You’re just blissfully ignorant, aren’t ya?

582
00:50:19.553 --> 00:50:23.098
– I have this condition.
– I know all about your fucking condition, Leonard!

583
00:50:23.181 --> 00:50:26.601
Probably know more about it than you do.
You don’t have a fucking clue about anything else.

584
00:50:26.685 --> 00:50:27.769
What happened?

585
00:50:27.853 --> 00:50:30.689
What happened is that Jimmy
went to meet some guy named Teddy.

586
00:50:30.772 --> 00:50:33.483
He took a lot of money with him,
and he never came back.

587
00:50:33.567 --> 00:50:37.154
Jimmy’s partners think I set him up.
I don’t know if you know this Teddy, or how well.

588
00:50:37.237 --> 00:50:38.905
– Neither do I.
– Don’t protect him!

589
00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:40.032
– I’m not.
– Help me.

590
00:50:40.115 --> 00:50:41.365
How?

591
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.618
Get rid of Dodd for me.

592
00:50:43.702 --> 00:50:45.746
– What?
– Kill him. I’ll pay you.

593
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.874
What do you think I am?
I’m not gonna kill someone for money.

594
00:50:48.957 --> 00:50:51.001
What then? Love?

595
00:50:51.084 --> 00:50:52.794
What would you kill for?

596
00:50:52.878 --> 00:50:55.464
– You’d kill for your wife, wouldn’t you?
– That’s different.

597
00:50:55.547 --> 00:50:59.051
– Not to me. I wasn’t fucking married to her.
– Hey, don’t talk about my wife.

598
00:50:59.134 --> 00:51:01.385
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

599
00:51:02.012 --> 00:51:03.930
I can say whatever I want
and you won’t remember.

600
00:51:04.014 --> 00:51:06.140
I could call your wife a fucking whore
and we could still be friends.

601
00:51:06.224 --> 00:51:08.435
– Calm down.
– Easy for you to say. You can’t get scared.

602
00:51:08.518 --> 00:51:12.105
– You don’t know how, you fucking idiot!
– Take it easy. This has nothing to do with me.

603
00:51:12.189 --> 00:51:15.692
Maybe it does. How the fuck would you know?
You don’t know a fucking thing!

604
00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:20.113
– You can’t get scared, but can you get angry?
– Yes.

605
00:51:20.197 --> 00:51:22.532
You pathetic piece of shit.

606
00:51:22.616 --> 00:51:24.701
I can say whatever the fuck I want…

607
00:51:24.785 --> 00:51:27.371
and you won’t have a fucking clue,
you fucking retard!

608
00:51:27.454 --> 00:51:29.955
– Shut your mouth.
– You know what? I’m gonna use you.

609
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.541
I’m telling you now,
because I’m gonna enjoy it so much more…

610
00:51:32.626 --> 00:51:36.171
if I know that you could stop me
if you weren’t such a fucking freak.

611
00:51:36.254 --> 00:51:38.048
Did you lose your pen?

612
00:51:38.131 --> 00:51:41.551
That’s too bad, freak. Otherwise,
you could write yourself a little note…

613
00:51:41.635 --> 00:51:45.222
about how much Natalie hates your retarded guts
and that I called your wife a fuckin’ whore.

614
00:51:45.305 --> 00:51:48.016
– Don’t say another fuckin’ word.
– About your whore of a wife?

615
00:51:51.686 --> 00:51:53.855
I read about your condition, Leonard.

616
00:51:53.939 --> 00:51:58.527
You know what one of the causes
of short-term memory loss is? Venereal disease.

617
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:03.490
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife
sucked one too many diseased cocks…

618
00:52:03.573 --> 00:52:05.283
and turned you into a fucking retard!

619
00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:10.789
You sad, sad freak.

620
00:52:12.249 --> 00:52:14.960
I can say whatever the fuck I want…

621
00:52:15.043 --> 00:52:17.462
and you won’t remember.

622
00:52:18.296 --> 00:52:20.340
We’ll still be best friends…

623
00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:23.969
or maybe even lovers.

624
00:52:26.638 --> 00:52:27.389
Fuck.

625
00:52:33.478 --> 00:52:35.397
I’ll see you soon.

626
00:52:42.112 --> 00:52:45.115
Stay focused. Find a pen.

627
00:52:45.615 --> 00:52:48.326
Gotta write this down. Gotta write it down.

628
00:52:49.744 --> 00:52:52.372
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

629
00:52:53.248 --> 00:52:56.042
Keep it in mind.
Keep it in mind. Keep it in mind.

630
00:52:59.045 --> 00:53:01.423
Come on. Gotta find a pen.
I gotta find a pen.

631
00:53:01.506 --> 00:53:05.469
Write this down.
Write this down, exactly what happened.

632
00:53:05.552 --> 00:53:07.429
Gonna write down exactly what happened.
Come on.

633
00:53:07.512 --> 00:53:09.848
I gotta find a pen. Geez! Come on.

634
00:53:10.599 --> 00:53:12.349
Keep focused. Keep focused.

635
00:53:14.144 --> 00:53:15.896
Keep it in mind.
Come on. Find a pen.

636
00:53:15.979 --> 00:53:17.814
Write this note.
Write down what happened.

637
00:53:17.898 --> 00:53:21.193
Write it down. Concentrate.
Keep it in mind.

638
00:53:29.868 --> 00:53:30.993
What happened?

639
00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:33.163
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

640
00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:34.498
Who?

641
00:53:34.581 --> 00:53:36.291
Who?

642
00:53:36.374 --> 00:53:38.563
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

643
00:53:39.474 --> 00:53:42.088
Write this down.
Write down what happened. Write it down.

644
00:53:42.171 --> 00:53:44.507
Concentrate.
Keep it in mind. Find a pen.

645
00:53:51.139 --> 00:53:52.264
What happened?

646
00:53:52.348 --> 00:53:54.392
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

647
00:53:54.475 --> 00:53:55.852
Who?

648
00:53:55.935 --> 00:53:57.687
Who?

649
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:59.814
Fuck, Leonard. Dodd.
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

650
00:53:59.897 --> 00:54:01.816
– Why?
– Why? Because of you.

651
00:54:01.899 --> 00:54:04.610
Because I did what you told me to do!
Go in and reason with him!

652
00:54:04.694 --> 00:54:08.239
– Tell him about Teddy! Great fucking idea!
– Calm down. Take it easy.

653
00:54:08.322 --> 00:54:10.158
You’re safe. It’s okay.

654
00:54:11.742 --> 00:54:14.036
Come on. Just sit down.

655
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.038
Sit down.

656
00:54:16.122 --> 00:54:18.040
Here. Sit down.

657
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.960
Okay. You’re okay.

658
00:54:21.043 --> 00:54:23.337
I’ll just get some ice for your face.

659
00:54:31.012 --> 00:54:32.262
Here.

660
00:54:38.769 --> 00:54:41.105
I did exactly what you told me to do.

661
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.358
I went to Dodd…

662
00:54:45.485 --> 00:54:48.863
and I told him
that I didn’t have any of Jimmy’s money…

663
00:54:49.697 --> 00:54:51.407
or the drugs…

664
00:54:52.533 --> 00:54:56.203
and that this Teddy
must have taken everything.

665
00:54:56.287 --> 00:54:57.914
And what did he say?

666
00:54:58.998 --> 00:55:00.917
He didn’t believe me.

667
00:55:03.461 --> 00:55:06.505
He said if I don’t have the drugs
by tomorrow, he’s gonna kill me.

668
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:09.050
Then he just started hitting me.

669
00:55:12.094 --> 00:55:13.679
Where is he?

670
00:55:13.763 --> 00:55:16.682
– Why?
– I’ll go see him.

671
00:55:16.766 --> 00:55:17.766
And?

672
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:21.062
I’ll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

673
00:55:21.854 --> 00:55:23.564
He’ll kill you, Lenny.

674
00:55:25.524 --> 00:55:27.485
My wife used to call me Lenny.

675
00:55:27.568 --> 00:55:28.986
Yeah?

676
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:32.657
Yeah. I hated it.

677
00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:36.244
This guy is so dangerous.

678
00:55:36.327 --> 00:55:39.872
– Let’s just think of something else, okay?
– No, no.

679
00:55:39.956 --> 00:55:44.001
You just tell me what he looks like…
and where I can find him.

680
00:55:44.085 --> 00:55:47.630
– Have you got a pen?
– In my purse.

681
00:55:57.807 --> 00:55:59.557
He’ll probably find you.

682
00:55:59.642 --> 00:56:02.979
– What do you mean?
– I told him about your car.

683
00:56:03.771 --> 00:56:04.771
Why?

684
00:56:06.983 --> 00:56:10.111
He was beating the shit out of me.
I had to tell him something.

685
00:56:11.195 --> 00:56:12.947
Just write it all down.

686
00:56:28.087 --> 00:56:29.337
Be careful.

687
00:56:30.423 --> 00:56:32.341
I’ll be fine.

688
00:56:39.432 --> 00:56:42.246
– A car this nice you should lock.
– Who the fuck are you?

689
00:56:52.486 --> 00:56:55.322
– A car this nice you should lock.
– Who the fuck are you?

690
00:56:55.405 --> 00:56:57.741
– Teddy, your buddy.
– Prove it.

691
00:56:57.824 --> 00:57:01.453
Sammy. Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

692
00:57:02.996 --> 00:57:04.498
Geez!

693
00:57:04.581 --> 00:57:06.500
What the fuck are you doing in my car?

694
00:57:06.583 --> 00:57:08.709
What, your sense of humor went with the memory?

695
00:57:08.794 --> 00:57:11.755
– Do you even know why you’re here?
– Unfinished business.

696
00:57:11.838 --> 00:57:14.216
Lenny, let me inform you.

697
00:57:14.299 --> 00:57:16.677
Your business here is very much finished.

698
00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:19.763
– You’re still here because of Natalie.
– Who’s Natalie?

699
00:57:19.846 --> 00:57:22.975
Schmuck, whose house do you think
you just walked out of?

700
00:57:25.352 --> 00:57:28.772
That’s right. Take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

701
00:57:30.691 --> 00:57:32.985
Nice shot, Leibovitz.

702
00:57:33.652 --> 00:57:36.822
You’ll wanna make a note.
You can’t trust her.

703
00:57:36.905 --> 00:57:38.282
Yeah? Why’s that?

704
00:57:38.365 --> 00:57:41.618
Because by now she’s taken
a look at this suit and the car…

705
00:57:41.702 --> 00:57:46.080
and she’s starting to figure out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

706
00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.501
She’s already got you staying
with her, for Christ’s sakes.

707
00:57:49.584 --> 00:57:53.171
You can’t go back in there.
Let me give you the name of a motel.

708
00:57:53.255 --> 00:57:57.134
– You’re lucky I ran into you. That broad’s bad news.
– What do you mean, “bad news”?

709
00:57:57.217 --> 00:57:59.511
She’s involved with drugs.

710
00:57:59.595 --> 00:58:01.888
Look. These. You see these?

711
00:58:01.972 --> 00:58:03.932
This is the bar where she works.

712
00:58:04.016 --> 00:58:06.059
Her boyfriend’s a drug dealer.

713
00:58:06.143 --> 00:58:08.769
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

714
00:58:08.854 --> 00:58:11.732
He writes messages on the back of these.

715
00:58:11.815 --> 00:58:14.359
Then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

716
00:58:14.443 --> 00:58:18.529
– Why should I care?
– Because when she gets jammed up…

717
00:58:18.613 --> 00:58:20.782
she’s gonna use you to protect herself.

718
00:58:20.866 --> 00:58:22.075
From who?

719
00:58:22.159 --> 00:58:24.910
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

720
00:58:24.995 --> 00:58:28.540
Guys are gonna come after her.
Somebody’s gotta pay, Lenny.

721
00:58:28.624 --> 00:58:31.668
Somebody always pays.
Maybe she’ll make it you.

722
00:58:31.752 --> 00:58:35.255
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she’ll make it you. Is that it?

723
00:58:35.339 --> 00:58:37.257
You worried that she’s gonna use me against you?

724
00:58:37.341 --> 00:58:39.342
– No.
– Why not?

725
00:58:40.052 --> 00:58:42.678
Because she doesn’t know who I am.

726
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.224
– Why are you following me?
– Maybe I wanna help.

727
00:58:47.017 --> 00:58:50.228
She doesn’t know anything about
your investigation, okay, Einstein?

728
00:58:50.312 --> 00:58:52.981
So write this down.

729
00:58:53.065 --> 00:58:57.736
When she offers to help,
it’ll be for her own reasons.

730
00:58:57.819 --> 00:59:02.616
I’m not lying.
Take my pen. Write this down.

731
00:59:02.699 --> 00:59:04.868
Do not trust her.

732
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:15.796
– There. You happy now?
– I won’t be happy until you leave town.

733
00:59:15.879 --> 00:59:17.798
Why not?

734
00:59:17.881 --> 00:59:21.385
You ever wonder how long you can hang around
here before people start asking questions?

735
00:59:21.468 --> 00:59:22.552
What sort of questions?

736
00:59:22.636 --> 00:59:24.762
The same sort of questions
you should be asking yourself.

737
00:59:24.846 --> 00:59:27.391
– Like what?
– Like, how did you get this suit, the car?

738
00:59:27.474 --> 00:59:29.101
– I have money.
– From what?

739
00:59:29.184 --> 00:59:32.562
My wife’s death. I used to work in insurance.
We were well covered.

740
00:59:34.648 --> 00:59:38.402
So in your grief you wandered
into a Jaguar dealership.

741
00:59:40.737 --> 00:59:42.906
You don’t have a clue, do you?

742
00:59:42.989 --> 00:59:45.534
– You don’t even know who you are.
– Yes, I do.

743
00:59:45.617 --> 00:59:49.371
I don’t have amnesia. I remember
everything right up until the incident.

744
00:59:49.454 --> 00:59:51.248
I am Leonard Shelby.
I am from San Francisco—

745
00:59:51.331 --> 00:59:55.961
That’s who you were.
You do not know who you are…

746
00:59:56.044 --> 00:59:59.964
what you’ve become since… the incident.

747
01:00:00.048 --> 01:00:02.592
You wander around playing detective.

748
01:00:02.676 --> 01:00:05.262
You don’t even know how long ago it was.

749
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:11.058
Let me put it this way. Were you wearing
designer suits when you sold insurance?

750
01:00:11.143 --> 01:00:14.938
– I didn’t sell insurance. I investigated it.
– Right. You’re an investigator.

751
01:00:15.856 --> 01:00:20.484
– Maybe you should start investigating yourself.
– Thank you for the advice.

752
01:00:22.696 --> 01:00:25.282
Look, do me a favor. Don’t go back in there.

753
01:00:25.949 --> 01:00:28.075
Will you take the motel out of town?

754
01:00:31.663 --> 01:00:33.623
It’s been fun, Lenny.

755
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:42.591
“Do not trust her.”

756
01:00:44.384 --> 01:00:46.385
“Don’t believe his lies.”

757
01:00:59.316 --> 01:01:01.526
Fuck it. I need my own place.

758
01:01:09.006 --> 01:01:10.494
“Discount Inn.”

759
01:02:04.464 --> 01:02:06.675
Yeah, okay. Blonde’s fine.

760
01:02:09.052 --> 01:02:11.178
That’s what they say.

761
01:02:11.263 --> 01:02:13.389
The Discount Inn. 304.

762
01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:15.434
Leonard.

763
01:02:16.852 --> 01:02:18.270
What then?

764
01:02:18.854 --> 01:02:21.565
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

765
01:02:21.648 --> 01:02:23.734
You go into the bathroom and you slam the door.

766
01:02:23.817 --> 01:02:26.361
– Slam it?
– Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

767
01:02:26.445 --> 01:02:28.405
– And that’s it?
– That’s it.

768
01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.244
First I just need you to put
these things around the room.

769
01:02:37.289 --> 01:02:40.417
Just pretend they’re your things
and that this is your bedroom.

770
01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:57.100
– Should I wear it?
– No. Just like you took it off or something.

771
01:03:00.062 --> 01:03:02.481
I don’t want you to use it. I’m sorry.

772
01:03:04.191 --> 01:03:06.276
I just mean put them
around the room…

773
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.946
as if they were your things.

774
01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:15.451
Whatever gets you off.

775
01:04:14.845 --> 01:04:15.929
Honey.

776
01:04:18.432 --> 01:04:20.225
Honey, it’s late.

777
01:04:42.456 --> 01:04:44.374
Everything okay?

778
01:05:02.017 --> 01:05:03.477
You okay in there?

779
01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.690
Was it good for you?

780
01:05:10.901 --> 01:05:13.820
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

781
01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:15.822
No.

782
01:05:18.241 --> 01:05:20.160
I’d like you to leave now.

783
01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:00.134
Ouch. Cut it out.

784
01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:35.085
– How can you read that again?
– It’s good.

785
01:07:36.337 --> 01:07:38.214
Yeah, but you’ve read it,
like, a thousand times.

786
01:07:38.297 --> 01:07:39.882
I enjoy it.

787
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.886
I always thought the pleasure of a book
was in wanting to know what happens next.

788
01:07:43.969 --> 01:07:45.679
Don’t be a prick.

789
01:07:45.763 --> 01:07:48.349
I’m not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

790
01:07:49.475 --> 01:07:51.976
Just let me read, please.

791
01:08:02.822 --> 01:08:05.198
Probably tried this before.

792
01:08:07.326 --> 01:08:10.162
Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.

793
01:08:12.706 --> 01:08:14.707
Can’t remember to forget you.

794
01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:02.589
Do I know this guy?

795
01:09:04.049 --> 01:09:05.592
He seems to know me.

796
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.848
What the fuck?

797
01:09:25.445 --> 01:09:27.614
– I like your car.
– Thank you.

798
01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.698
– Where’d you get it?
– Are you interested in buying one?

799
01:09:30.325 --> 01:09:32.244
I haven’t made a strong enough
impression on you?

800
01:09:32.327 --> 01:09:34.328
I wouldn’t be too hard on yourself.

801
01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:46.967
Okay. What am I doing?

802
01:09:54.349 --> 01:09:56.142
Okay. What am I doing?

803
01:09:58.478 --> 01:10:00.105
I’m chasing this guy.

804
01:10:02.691 --> 01:10:05.360
No. He’s chasing me.

805
01:10:28.174 --> 01:10:29.801
Fuck.

806
01:10:33.221 --> 01:10:35.515
“Dodd. White guy.

807
01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.559
Mountcrest Inn on Fifth Street.”

808
01:10:38.518 --> 01:10:41.187
I’ll get the jump on you, you fucker.

809
01:11:17.724 --> 01:11:19.184
Fuck.

810
01:11:21.853 --> 01:11:23.188
Sorry.

811
01:11:56.721 --> 01:11:58.722
I need a weapon.

812
01:12:01.976 --> 01:12:03.144
This’ll do.

813
01:12:26.876 --> 01:12:29.233
I don’t feel drunk.

814
01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:35.552
I don’t feel drunk.

815
01:13:47.749 --> 01:13:49.249
– Hello?
– Shit.

816
01:13:49.334 --> 01:13:50.752
Housekeeping.

817
01:13:50.835 --> 01:13:52.921
– Not right now.
– I’m sorry.

818
01:14:16.236 --> 01:14:17.112
Okay.

819
01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:25.953
“Dodd. Put him onto Teddy
or just get rid of him for Natalie.”

820
01:14:32.001 --> 01:14:33.128
Dodd.

821
01:14:38.299 --> 01:14:41.678
Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.

822
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.180
Teddy, Teddy.

823
01:14:56.609 --> 01:14:58.862
<i>Leave your number.
You know what to do.</i>

824
01:14:58.945 --> 01:15:01.114
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

825
01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.241
I’m at the Mountcrest Inn
of Fifth Street, room six.

826
01:15:03.324 --> 01:15:06.327
I need you to come over
as soon as you get this. It’s important.

827
01:15:06.411 --> 01:15:08.662
This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.

828
01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:14.461
Fuck.

829
01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:32.060
Awake.

830
01:15:33.813 --> 01:15:35.313
Where am I?

831
01:15:36.982 --> 01:15:38.526
Motel room.

832
01:15:45.116 --> 01:15:47.660
Some anonymous motel room.

833
01:15:51.163 --> 01:15:54.583
Nothing in the drawers,
but I’ll take a look anyway.

834
01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:58.129
Nothing except the Gideon Bible.

835
01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:14.353
Lenny! Open up!

836
01:16:16.522 --> 01:16:18.149
Just a minute.

837
01:16:18.232 --> 01:16:19.775
Open the door.

838
01:16:22.027 --> 01:16:23.112
Lenny.

839
01:16:25.906 --> 01:16:27.867
Open the door.

840
01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.872
Come on!

841
01:16:34.749 --> 01:16:36.459
Hi, Teddy.

842
01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:38.793
Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

843
01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:53.058
I get it.

844
01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:54.602
Amorous neighbors.

845
01:16:54.685 --> 01:16:56.145
What are you doing here?

846
01:16:56.937 --> 01:16:59.940
You called me. You said you needed my help.

847
01:17:00.024 --> 01:17:03.569
I’ve had more rewarding
friendships than this one.

848
01:17:03.652 --> 01:17:06.989
Although I do get to keep
telling the same jokes.

849
01:17:07.656 --> 01:17:09.742
What the fuck is that?

850
01:17:15.247 --> 01:17:17.248
– Who the fuck is that?
– You don’t know him?

851
01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:18.958
No! Should I?

852
01:17:19.043 --> 01:17:20.668
Wait a minute.

853
01:17:20.753 --> 01:17:23.214
– Is that John G.?
– I don’t think so.

854
01:17:23.297 --> 01:17:26.592
– You don’t think so? You didn’t write it down?
– I might’ve fallen asleep before I did.

855
01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:28.676
For Christ’s sakes!

856
01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:31.514
Ask him.

857
01:17:35.601 --> 01:17:37.144
What’s your name?

858
01:17:37.228 --> 01:17:38.228
Your name.

859
01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:40.648
– Dodd.
– Who did this to you?

860
01:17:40.731 --> 01:17:43.317
– What?
– Who did this to you?

861
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.902
You did.

862
01:17:48.155 --> 01:17:51.408
– I’m not gonna help you kill that guy.
– No, just let me think for a minute.

863
01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:59.625
Okay, Natalie. Who’s Natalie?

864
01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.168
– Natalie who?
– Why?

865
01:18:01.252 --> 01:18:04.338
– Maybe I know her.
– Look. We gotta get him out of here.

866
01:18:05.256 --> 01:18:06.881
All right, all right.

867
01:18:08.008 --> 01:18:09.969
He’s gotta have a car, right?

868
01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:13.639
We take him down to his car, tell him to get
the fuck out of town or we’re gonna kill him.

869
01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.808
We can’t walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

870
01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:18.352
– How the fuck did you get him up here?
– I don’t know.

871
01:18:18.435 --> 01:18:20.396
You don’t know.

872
01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:24.483
Yes, I do. This is not my room.

873
01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:26.360
It must be his room. Great! Let’s go.

874
01:18:26.443 --> 01:18:28.404
– No, no. We can’t just leave him here.
– Why not?

875
01:18:28.487 --> 01:18:33.033
Because the maid’s gonna walk in.
She’ll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

876
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:36.745
Okay. We untie him…

877
01:18:36.829 --> 01:18:39.707
we clean him up, and we march him
out of here with a gun in his back.

878
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:41.750
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

879
01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.589
It must be his. I don’t think
they’d let someone like me carry a gun.

880
01:18:48.132 --> 01:18:49.425
Fucking hope not.

881
01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.267
Which one?

882
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:03.814
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

883
01:19:03.897 --> 01:19:04.857
Shut up.

884
01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:07.359
That’s all right for you to say.
You’re the one with the Jag.

885
01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.321
Get in.
I’m gonna ride with him. You follow us.

886
01:19:10.404 --> 01:19:12.323
Give me your keys.

887
01:19:12.406 --> 01:19:14.617
Take your own car.

888
01:19:42.561 --> 01:19:45.606
– So was he scared?
– Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache.

889
01:19:45.689 --> 01:19:48.400
Fuck you. You should have stolen his car.

890
01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:51.528
– Why? What’s wrong with this one?
– Nothing. You want to trade?

891
01:19:54.865 --> 01:19:56.951
So what do you do now?

892
01:19:57.034 --> 01:19:59.495
I’m going to find out
what the fuck that was all about.

893
01:20:07.086 --> 01:20:09.505
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

894
01:20:32.526 --> 01:20:35.029
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

895
01:20:38.658 --> 01:20:41.744
– Guess I don’t have to worry about him anymore.
– What the fuck have you got me into?

896
01:20:41.827 --> 01:20:43.329
Come inside.

897
01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:49.502
– Who is he?
– Calm down. Okay?

898
01:20:49.585 --> 01:20:53.089
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It has nothing to do with your investigation.

899
01:20:53.172 --> 01:20:54.674
How did you get me into this?

900
01:20:54.757 --> 01:20:56.801
You offered to help when you saw
what he did to my face.

901
01:20:56.884 --> 01:21:00.471
– How do I know he did that to your face?
– Because I came straight to you after he did it.

902
01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:02.807
I showed you what he did,
and I asked you to help me.

903
01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:04.850
– And I just take your word?
– Yeah.

904
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:08.229
Something doesn’t feel right.

905
01:21:08.312 --> 01:21:10.856
I think someone’s fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

906
01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.358
– Did you?
– What?

907
01:21:12.441 --> 01:21:14.860
– Kill him?
– Of course not!

908
01:21:14.944 --> 01:21:15.986
Hey.

909
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.905
Sit down, okay? Sit.

910
01:21:18.739 --> 01:21:21.826
This has nothing to do with you.

911
01:21:21.909 --> 01:21:24.285
You helped me out, and I’m grateful.

912
01:21:25.246 --> 01:21:27.081
You have to burn them.

913
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.670
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust yourself.

914
01:21:32.753 --> 01:21:34.754
Trust your own judgment.
You can question everything.

915
01:21:34.839 --> 01:21:38.592
– You can never know anything for sure.
– There are things you know for sure.

916
01:21:38.676 --> 01:21:39.801
Such as?

917
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:44.098
I know what that’s gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

918
01:21:44.807 --> 01:21:47.183
I know what that’s gonna
feel like when I pick it up.

919
01:21:47.268 --> 01:21:50.938
See? Certainties. It’s the kind
of memory you take for granted.

920
01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.941
You know, I can remember so much.

921
01:21:56.944 --> 01:22:00.239
The feel of the world… and her.

922
01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:08.664
She’s gone.

923
01:22:08.748 --> 01:22:12.710
And the present is trivia,
which I scribble down as fucking notes!

924
01:22:12.793 --> 01:22:15.713
Hey. Come on. Try and relax. Come on.

925
01:22:15.796 --> 01:22:18.132
It’s not easy for me to relax, you know?

926
01:22:18.924 --> 01:22:20.885
Come on. Take your jacket off.

927
01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.512
Now. Come on.

928
01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.057
Hey.

929
01:22:28.767 --> 01:22:30.936
Didn’t think you were the type.

930
01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:39.986
It’s backwards.

931
01:22:41.697 --> 01:22:42.740
Come here.

932
01:22:43.324 --> 01:22:44.492
Come here.

933
01:23:06.305 --> 01:23:08.431
What about here?

934
01:23:09.683 --> 01:23:12.186
Maybe it’s for when I find him.

935
01:23:14.939 --> 01:23:17.358
I’ve lost somebody too.

936
01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.778
I’m sorry.

937
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:23.072
His name was Jimmy.

938
01:23:23.155 --> 01:23:26.200
– What happened to him?
– He went to meet somebody.

939
01:23:26.283 --> 01:23:28.244
He never came back.

940
01:23:29.245 --> 01:23:31.996
– Who did he go to meet?
– A guy called Teddy.

941
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:35.291
What do the police think?

942
01:23:35.376 --> 01:23:38.254
They don’t look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

943
01:23:39.922 --> 01:23:43.884
When you find this guy, this John G…

944
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:46.929
what are you gonna do?

945
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:50.599
I’m gonna kill him.

946
01:23:52.142 --> 01:23:54.186
Maybe I can help you find him.

947
01:23:59.191 --> 01:24:01.694
I don’t even know how long she’s been gone.

948
01:24:06.073 --> 01:24:09.076
It’s like I’ve woken up in bed
and she’s not here…

949
01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.955
because she’s gone to
the bathroom or something.

950
01:24:18.919 --> 01:24:21.005
But somehow I just—

951
01:24:21.755 --> 01:24:25.050
I just know she’s never gonna come back to bed.

952
01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:36.103
If I could just reach over
and touch her side of the bed…

953
01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:39.897
I would know that it was cold.

954
01:24:43.068 --> 01:24:45.029
But I can’t.

955
01:24:49.158 --> 01:24:50.951
I know I can’t have her back.

956
01:24:52.661 --> 01:24:56.664
But I don’t want to wake up
in the morning thinking she’s still here.

957
01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:02.588
I lie here not knowing
how long I’ve been alone.

958
01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:13.432
How can I heal?

959
01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:20.981
How am I supposed to heal
if I can’t… feel time?

960
01:26:33.846 --> 01:26:36.306
“She has also lost someone.

961
01:26:36.849 --> 01:26:38.850
She will help you out of pity.”

962
01:27:07.128 --> 01:27:08.503
Awake.

963
01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:12.216
Where am I?

964
01:27:16.095 --> 01:27:17.847
Somebody’s bedroom.

965
01:27:19.557 --> 01:27:21.517
It must be her room.

966
01:27:22.935 --> 01:27:24.645
But who is she?

967
01:27:32.903 --> 01:27:34.864
It’s only me.

968
01:27:37.116 --> 01:27:40.077
– Did you sleep okay?
– Yeah. You?

969
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:45.541
Oh, shit. I gotta be someplace.

970
01:27:50.212 --> 01:27:53.049
– It’s pretty weird.
– It’s useful.

971
01:27:54.091 --> 01:27:56.052
You never write a phone number on your hand?

972
01:27:56.677 --> 01:28:01.599
I should be able to talk to my friend
today about the license plate.

973
01:28:01.682 --> 01:28:05.519
– Yeah, the license plate.
– John G.’s license plate.

974
01:28:08.731 --> 01:28:10.649
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

975
01:28:28.918 --> 01:28:30.503
“Natalie.”

976
01:28:33.089 --> 01:28:35.090
“She has also lost someone.

977
01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:37.093
She will help you out of pity.”

978
01:28:42.348 --> 01:28:44.266
If it’s registered in this state…

979
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:47.353
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his license and registration.

980
01:28:47.436 --> 01:28:49.230
I’ll call you as soon as I talk to him.

981
01:28:49.313 --> 01:28:53.316
Do you think we could just arrange a meeting now?
I’m not too good on the phone.

982
01:29:01.909 --> 01:29:03.910
It’s great that you—

983
01:29:05.412 --> 01:29:09.500
that you’re helping me like this.

984
01:29:09.583 --> 01:29:13.087
I’m helping you because you helped me.

985
01:29:25.182 --> 01:29:29.061
So next time you see me,
will you remember me?

986
01:29:46.162 --> 01:29:48.080
I think you will.

987
01:29:49.832 --> 01:29:51.542
I’m sorry.

988
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:57.506
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

989
01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:16.672
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

990
01:30:22.322 --> 01:30:25.283
Yo, Lenny! I thought you split for good.

991
01:30:25.367 --> 01:30:28.661
– Things change.
– So I see.

992
01:30:28.745 --> 01:30:31.831
– My name’s Teddy.
– I guess I’ve told you about my condition.

993
01:30:31.915 --> 01:30:35.918
Only every time I see you.
Come on, I’ll buy you lunch.

994
01:30:41.549 --> 01:30:43.802
– Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
– Yeah.

995
01:30:43.885 --> 01:30:48.431
I’m sick of hearing about the guy.
What about John G.? You think he’s still here?

996
01:30:48.515 --> 01:30:50.766
– Who?
– Johnny G., the guy you’re looking for.

997
01:30:50.850 --> 01:30:53.436
– That’s why you haven’t left town, am I right?
– Maybe.

998
01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.815
– Leonard, look. You have to be very careful.
– Why?

999
01:30:56.898 --> 01:31:00.318
The other day you mentioned that maybe
somebody was trying to set you up…

1000
01:31:00.402 --> 01:31:02.152
get you to kill the wrong guy.

1001
01:31:02.237 --> 01:31:05.323
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

1002
01:31:05.407 --> 01:31:08.451
Lenny, you can’t trust a man’s life
to your little notes and pictures.

1003
01:31:08.535 --> 01:31:11.329
– Why not?
– Because your notes could be unreliable.

1004
01:31:11.413 --> 01:31:13.081
– Memory’s unreliable.
– Oh, please!

1005
01:31:13.164 --> 01:31:15.500
No, really. Memory’s not perfect.
It’s not even that good.

1006
01:31:15.583 --> 01:31:19.128
Ask the police.
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

1007
01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:22.173
The cops don’t catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

1008
01:31:22.257 --> 01:31:25.051
They collect facts, they make notes,
and they draw conclusions.

1009
01:31:25.135 --> 01:31:27.178
Facts, not memories.

1010
01:31:27.262 --> 01:31:29.723
That’s how you investigate.
I know. It’s what I used to do.

1011
01:31:29.806 --> 01:31:34.018
Memory can change the shape of a room.
It can change the color of a car.

1012
01:31:34.102 --> 01:31:36.187
And memories can be distorted.

1013
01:31:36.271 --> 01:31:38.440
They’re just an interpretation.
They’re not a record.

1014
01:31:38.523 --> 01:31:40.608
They’re irrelevant if you have the facts.

1015
01:31:41.443 --> 01:31:43.403
You really want to get this guy, don’t you?

1016
01:31:43.486 --> 01:31:46.281
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

1017
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.201
He destroyed my ability to live.

1018
01:31:55.081 --> 01:31:56.124
You’re living.

1019
01:31:57.959 --> 01:31:59.919
Only for revenge.

1020
01:32:00.003 --> 01:32:02.839
Then we’ll get the bastard.
Where you staying?

1021
01:32:05.633 --> 01:32:07.385
The Discount Inn.

1022
01:32:09.012 --> 01:32:10.930
I don’t know what room.
I haven’t got my key.

1023
01:32:11.014 --> 01:32:12.849
Probably left it in your room.

1024
01:32:27.655 --> 01:32:30.408
Hi. I’m checked in here,
but I think I’ve misplaced my key.

1025
01:32:31.117 --> 01:32:34.746
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

1026
01:32:53.431 --> 01:32:55.016
– Don’t see my key anywhere.
– Shit.

1027
01:32:55.099 --> 01:32:57.185
This is the wrong room.
You’re in 304 now.

1028
01:32:57.268 --> 01:32:59.269
– I’m sorry. I fucked up.
– This is not my room?

1029
01:32:59.354 --> 01:33:00.854
No. Let’s go.

1030
01:33:01.981 --> 01:33:03.942
Why is this my handwriting?

1031
01:33:08.071 --> 01:33:10.907
This was your room,
but now you’re in 304.

1032
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:13.243
– When was I in here?
– Last week.

1033
01:33:13.326 --> 01:33:15.787
But then I rented you
another room on top of it.

1034
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:17.996
– Why?
– Business is slow.

1035
01:33:18.081 --> 01:33:20.959
I told my boss
about your condition and stuff…

1036
01:33:21.042 --> 01:33:23.253
and he said,
“Try and rent him another room.”

1037
01:33:23.336 --> 01:33:25.380
How many rooms am I checked
into in this shit-hole?

1038
01:33:25.463 --> 01:33:27.924
Just two, so far.

1039
01:33:29.551 --> 01:33:31.677
At least you’re being honest
about ripping me off.

1040
01:33:31.761 --> 01:33:34.305
You’re not gonna remember anyway.

1041
01:33:34.389 --> 01:33:36.307
You don’t have to be that honest, Burt.

1042
01:33:36.391 --> 01:33:40.019
Leonard, always get a receipt.

1043
01:33:40.103 --> 01:33:42.313
Yeah. I’m gonna write that down.

1044
01:33:44.774 --> 01:33:46.860
– What time is it?
– Quarter to 1:00.

1045
01:33:50.488 --> 01:33:51.613
Your room’s—

1046
01:34:04.419 --> 01:34:06.401
– Natalie?
– You don’t remember me.

1047
01:34:23.395 --> 01:34:26.565
“Today, 1:00 p.m. Meet Natalie for info.

1048
01:34:27.524 --> 01:34:29.234
She has also lost someone.

1049
01:34:29.318 --> 01:34:32.738
She will help you out of pity.”

1050
01:34:48.962 --> 01:34:51.465
– Natalie?
– You don’t remember me.

1051
01:34:51.548 --> 01:34:55.468
– Sorry. I should have explained. I have this—
– You did explain, Lenny.

1052
01:34:55.552 --> 01:34:57.928
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

1053
01:34:58.013 --> 01:35:01.600
– Yeah, I know. You told me.
– Then I probably told you how much I hated it.

1054
01:35:01.683 --> 01:35:03.101
Yeah.

1055
01:35:04.186 --> 01:35:06.605
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It’s hard for me to—

1056
01:35:08.190 --> 01:35:11.652
Thanks. So you have information for me?

1057
01:35:11.735 --> 01:35:14.488
– Is that what your little note says?
– Yeah.

1058
01:35:14.571 --> 01:35:17.449
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

1059
01:35:17.532 --> 01:35:19.326
You mix your laundry list
with your grocery list…

1060
01:35:19.409 --> 01:35:21.578
and you’ll end up
eating your underwear for breakfast.

1061
01:35:22.621 --> 01:35:25.415
I guess that’s why you have
those freaky tattoos.

1062
01:35:26.541 --> 01:35:29.669
Yeah, it’s tough. It’s almost impossible.

1063
01:35:30.212 --> 01:35:32.713
I’m sorry I don’t remember you.
It’s nothing personal.

1064
01:35:35.842 --> 01:35:37.968
I do have information for you.

1065
01:35:38.637 --> 01:35:40.638
You gave me a license plate number.

1066
01:35:41.848 --> 01:35:43.934
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

1067
01:35:44.768 --> 01:35:46.478
Guess what name came up.

1068
01:35:47.813 --> 01:35:51.066
John Edward Gammell. John G.

1069
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:53.777
– Do you know him?
– No.

1070
01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:56.947
But his face on his driver’s license
looked really familiar.

1071
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:59.031
I think he’s been in the bar, maybe.

1072
01:35:59.116 --> 01:36:02.119
Here’s a copy of his license,
his registration, photo and all.

1073
01:36:02.786 --> 01:36:04.705
Are you sure you want this?

1074
01:36:04.788 --> 01:36:07.582
– Have I told you what this man did?
– Yeah.

1075
01:36:07.666 --> 01:36:09.418
Then you shouldn’t have to ask.

1076
01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:12.212
But even if you get revenge,
you’re not gonna remember it.

1077
01:36:12.295 --> 01:36:14.381
You’re not even gonna know that it happened.

1078
01:36:14.464 --> 01:36:17.801
My wife deserves vengeance. Doesn’t make
any difference whether I know about it.

1079
01:36:17.884 --> 01:36:22.139
Just because there are things I don’t remember
doesn’t make my actions meaningless.

1080
01:36:22.222 --> 01:36:25.183
The world doesn’t just disappear
when you close your eyes, does it?

1081
01:36:26.351 --> 01:36:29.896
Anyway, maybe I’ll take
a photograph to remind myself…

1082
01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:32.149
get another freaky tattoo.

1083
01:36:36.611 --> 01:36:38.530
Tell me about her again.

1084
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:41.115
Why?

1085
01:36:41.199 --> 01:36:43.118
Because you like to remember her.

1086
01:36:45.871 --> 01:36:47.789
She was beautiful.

1087
01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:54.421
– To me, she was perfect.
– No. Don’t just recite the words.

1088
01:36:55.714 --> 01:36:59.468
Close your eyes… and remember her.

1089
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.148
You can just feel the details.

1090
01:37:15.066 --> 01:37:17.861
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

1091
01:37:22.532 --> 01:37:25.368
And you can feel these extreme moments…

1092
01:37:25.452 --> 01:37:27.370
<i>even if you don’t want to.</i>

1093
01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.043
<i>You put these together,
and you get the feel of a person.</i>

1094
01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:38.547
Enough to know how much you miss them…

1095
01:37:44.346 --> 01:37:47.057
<i>and how much you hate
the person who took them away.</i>

1096
01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.070
I added an address in here.

1097
01:38:00.153 --> 01:38:03.615
It might be useful.
It’s an abandoned place outside of town.

1098
01:38:03.698 --> 01:38:06.618
A guy I knew used to do bigger deals there.

1099
01:38:09.496 --> 01:38:10.746
It’s isolated.

1100
01:38:10.831 --> 01:38:12.749
Sounds perfect.

1101
01:38:15.418 --> 01:38:18.713
– Do I owe you any—
– I wasn’t helping you for money.

1102
01:38:18.797 --> 01:38:21.007
– I’m sorry.
– It’s okay.

1103
01:38:21.091 --> 01:38:23.217
See, you have this condition.

1104
01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:29.223
Are you still staying at the Discount Inn,
room 304? You left it at my place.

1105
01:38:34.771 --> 01:38:36.231
Yeah.

1106
01:38:38.108 --> 01:38:40.902
– They treating you okay?
– I don’t remember.

1107
01:38:44.072 --> 01:38:45.782
You know what we have in common?

1108
01:38:47.284 --> 01:38:50.245
We are both survivors.

1109
01:38:52.664 --> 01:38:54.665
You take care, Leonard.

1110
01:39:23.236 --> 01:39:25.280
“Remember Sammy Jankis.”

1111
01:39:34.247 --> 01:39:36.498
“Remember Sammy Jankis.”

1112
01:40:06.112 --> 01:40:08.448
Excuse me, sir.
You left these at your table.

1113
01:40:08.531 --> 01:40:10.241
Thanks.

1114
01:40:11.409 --> 01:40:13.077
– Lincoln Street?
– Yeah.

1115
01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:15.287
Go straight out on Sixth Street.
Go east all the way—

1116
01:40:15.371 --> 01:40:17.582
– Hold on. I’m gonna write this down.
– It’s easy. Just go—

1117
01:40:17.665 --> 01:40:19.625
Trust me. I need to write this down.

1118
01:40:26.632 --> 01:40:28.633
“The Discount Inn.”

1119
01:40:52.408 --> 01:40:54.409
Discount Inn.

1120
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:57.245
Natalie.

1121
01:40:59.415 --> 01:41:00.625
My car.

1122
01:41:03.044 --> 01:41:04.419
Teddy.

1123
01:41:17.016 --> 01:41:19.267
“John Edward Gammell.”

1124
01:41:21.145 --> 01:41:23.940
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

1125
01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.821
“Don’t believe his lies.”

1126
01:41:45.461 --> 01:41:47.255
<i>– Yeah?</i>
– Mr. Gammell?

1127
01:41:47.338 --> 01:41:49.215
<i>– Lenny, is that you?</i>
– John Gammell?

1128
01:41:49.298 --> 01:41:51.717
<i>Lenny, it’s Teddy. Stay there.
I’ll be right over.</i>

1129
01:41:51.801 --> 01:41:53.719
Okay. I’ll be waiting.

1130
01:42:53.404 --> 01:42:55.114
“White. Male.”

1131
01:42:56.574 --> 01:42:58.700
“First name John.”

1132
01:42:58.784 --> 01:43:01.704
“Last name: G” for Gammell.

1133
01:43:07.710 --> 01:43:10.379
“Drugs. License plate.”

1134
01:43:11.714 --> 01:43:13.883
“SG13…

1135
01:43:15.718 --> 01:43:17.803
7IU.”

1136
01:43:22.391 --> 01:43:23.893
It’s him.

1137
01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:32.067
I found you, you fuck.

1138
01:45:29.184 --> 01:45:30.644
– Hi.
– Hi.

1139
01:45:30.728 --> 01:45:33.981
– I’m Mr. Shelby from 304.
– What can I do for you, Leonard?

1140
01:45:35.274 --> 01:45:35.941
Burt.

1141
01:45:36.025 --> 01:45:39.361
Burt. I’m not sure. I think I may have
asked you to hold my calls.

1142
01:45:39.445 --> 01:45:42.281
– You don’t know?
– I think I may have. I’m not good on the phone.

1143
01:45:42.364 --> 01:45:45.033
Right. You said you like to look people
in the eye when you talk to them.

1144
01:45:45.117 --> 01:45:46.535
Yeah.

1145
01:45:46.618 --> 01:45:48.245
You don’t remember saying that?

1146
01:45:48.829 --> 01:45:51.582
– That’s the thing. I have this condition.
– A condition?

1147
01:45:51.665 --> 01:45:54.043
– It’s my memory.
– Amnesia?

1148
01:45:54.126 --> 01:45:56.920
No, no. It’s different from that.
I have no short-term memory.

1149
01:45:57.004 --> 01:45:59.965
I know who I am. I know all about myself.

1150
01:46:00.048 --> 01:46:04.511
Since my injury, I can’t make new memories.
Everything fades.

1151
01:46:04.595 --> 01:46:06.805
If we talk for too long,
I’ll forget how we started.

1152
01:46:06.889 --> 01:46:09.600
Next time I see you,
I’m not gonna remember this conversation.

1153
01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:12.269
I don’t even know if I’ve met you before.

1154
01:46:12.936 --> 01:46:16.440
So, if I seem a little strange
or rude or something—

1155
01:46:18.817 --> 01:46:20.486
I’ve told you this before, haven’t I?

1156
01:46:20.569 --> 01:46:24.655
Yeah. I don’t mean to mess with you,
but it’s so weird.

1157
01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:26.950
– You don’t remember me at all?
– No.

1158
01:46:27.034 --> 01:46:29.870
– We’ve talked a bunch of times.
– I’m sure we have.

1159
01:46:31.038 --> 01:46:32.998
What’s the last thing you remember?

1160
01:46:33.082 --> 01:46:34.582
My wife.

1161
01:46:35.709 --> 01:46:37.461
What’s it like?

1162
01:46:42.090 --> 01:46:45.635
It’s like waking. It’s like you just woke up.

1163
01:46:47.012 --> 01:46:48.931
That must suck.

1164
01:46:49.014 --> 01:46:50.641
It’s all backwards.

1165
01:46:52.392 --> 01:46:55.979
Maybe you get an idea what you want to do next,
but you don’t remember what you just did.

1166
01:46:57.106 --> 01:47:00.901
– I’m exactly the opposite—
– How long have I been staying here?

1167
01:47:00.984 --> 01:47:03.028
– Couple of days.
– And you’re holding my calls?

1168
01:47:03.112 --> 01:47:06.824
– Like you said.
– Okay, but this guy’s an exception.

1169
01:47:07.407 --> 01:47:10.786
– You know this guy?
– Yeah, it’s your friend, right?

1170
01:47:10.869 --> 01:47:12.955
What makes you think he’s my friend?

1171
01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:15.999
– I just saw you together, that’s all.
– He’s not my friend.

1172
01:47:16.083 --> 01:47:18.919
– Okay.
– If he calls or if he shows up here…

1173
01:47:19.002 --> 01:47:20.796
give me a call in my room, okay?

1174
01:47:20.879 --> 01:47:22.464
His name’s Teddy?

1175
01:47:22.548 --> 01:47:24.508
– Teddy, yeah.
– All right.

1176
01:47:25.843 --> 01:47:28.762
Look, I hope my condition’s
not gonna be a problem for you.

1177
01:47:28.846 --> 01:47:31.097
No, not as long as
you remember to pay the bill.

1178
01:47:31.849 --> 01:47:33.308
Yeah. Okay.

1179
01:47:33.851 --> 01:47:35.185
– Forty.
– Forty.

1180
01:47:37.396 --> 01:47:38.438
This guy—

1181
01:47:40.315 --> 01:47:42.234
He’s here already.

1182
01:47:43.402 --> 01:47:45.260
Lenny!

1183
01:47:47.656 --> 01:47:49.156
This guy.

1184
01:47:49.241 --> 01:47:50.491
He’s here already.

1185
01:47:52.369 --> 01:47:53.578
Lenny!

1186
01:47:54.663 --> 01:47:56.038
It’s Leonard…

1187
01:47:57.207 --> 01:47:58.792
like I told you before.

1188
01:47:58.875 --> 01:48:00.876
Did you? I must have forgot.

1189
01:48:02.712 --> 01:48:04.756
I guess I’ve already
told you about my condition.

1190
01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.925
Only every time I see you.

1191
01:48:16.518 --> 01:48:18.562
– My car.
– This <i>is</i> your car.

1192
01:48:18.645 --> 01:48:20.689
You’re in a playful mood.

1193
01:48:22.232 --> 01:48:24.067
It’s not good to make fun
of someone’s handicap.

1194
01:48:24.651 --> 01:48:26.902
Just trying to have a little fun.

1195
01:48:33.368 --> 01:48:35.369
Roll up your window.

1196
01:48:41.418 --> 01:48:43.419
– It’s broken.
– I can get that fixed for you.

1197
01:48:45.547 --> 01:48:48.466
– So where to, Sherlock?
– I got a lead on a place.

1198
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:50.468
What the hell you wanna go there for?

1199
01:48:50.552 --> 01:48:52.928
– You know it?
– Yeah. It’s just this fucked-up building.

1200
01:48:53.013 --> 01:48:56.308
– Why do you wanna go there?
– Don’t remember.

1201
01:49:17.037 --> 01:49:20.165
– Looks like somebody’s home.
– That thing’s been here for years.

1202
01:49:23.585 --> 01:49:26.463
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

1203
01:49:26.546 --> 01:49:29.216
Tracks? What are you? Pocahontas?

1204
01:49:31.009 --> 01:49:32.259
Come on!

1205
01:49:40.185 --> 01:49:42.103
Let’s take a look inside.

1206
01:49:59.955 --> 01:50:01.248
“Teddy.”

1207
01:50:02.123 --> 01:50:06.251
“Don’t believe his lies.
He is the one. Kill him.”

1208
01:50:06.336 --> 01:50:10.090
I finally found him.
How long have I been looking?

1209
01:50:11.967 --> 01:50:13.134
Find anything?

1210
01:50:14.761 --> 01:50:16.346
Didn’t think so.

1211
01:50:16.429 --> 01:50:17.806
Let’s go.

1212
01:50:18.348 --> 01:50:19.723
Fuck this.

1213
01:50:21.893 --> 01:50:23.687
You’re gonna pay for what you did.

1214
01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:26.815
– Beg forgiveness, and then you pay.
– Leonard.

1215
01:50:30.485 --> 01:50:32.946
You don’t have a clue, you freak.

1216
01:50:33.029 --> 01:50:37.325
Beg my wife’s forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

1217
01:50:37.409 --> 01:50:40.370
Leonard, you don’t know what’s going on.

1218
01:50:40.453 --> 01:50:42.914
– You don’t even know my name.
– Teddy.

1219
01:50:42.998 --> 01:50:45.166
That’s ’cause you read it
off a fucking picture.

1220
01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:48.545
You don’t know who you are.

1221
01:50:48.628 --> 01:50:51.256
I’m Leonard Shelby. I’m from San Francisco.

1222
01:50:51.339 --> 01:50:55.176
That’s who you were.
That’s not what you’ve become.

1223
01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:57.761
– Shut your mouth.
– You want to know, Lenny?

1224
01:50:57.846 --> 01:50:59.139
Come on.

1225
01:50:59.222 --> 01:51:01.016
Come on. Let’s go down to the basement.

1226
01:51:02.017 --> 01:51:04.102
Let’s go down, you and me, together.

1227
01:51:04.185 --> 01:51:06.186
Then you’ll know who you really are.

1228
01:51:10.525 --> 01:51:11.693
No!
