00:43:08.086 --> 00:43:10.254

370

00:44:19.406 --> 00:44:22.533
I know you. I know about your sister.

384
00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:25.162
I know how you cared for her.

385
00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:33.544

Mm.

393
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:13.252
You can dispense justice

and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

395

And by the way...

396
00:45:21.761 --> 00:45:24.303
the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

397
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:28.683
If you want a true edge

398
00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:33.939
you have to used tempered steel.

399

Tempering's better for the long haul.

400
00:45:37.276 --> 00:45:39.319
You in this for the long haul, detective?

401
00:45:40.863 --> 00:45:44.073
I’ve been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

402
00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:48.328
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

403
00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:53.584
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

404
00:45:53.752 --> 00:45:55.294
What do you want from me?

405
00:45:55.836 --> 00:45:59.464
So you might look at what you did to Seth
as a kind of public service.

406
00:46:01.176 --> 00:46:04.303
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

407
00:46:04.511 --> 00:46:07.097
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

408
00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:09.182
You didn't see the blood!

409
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.602
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

410
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:15.189
Killing is distasteful...

411
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:18.274
...to me.

412
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:25.531
There is a better, more efficient way.

413
00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:36.126
What do you see...?
Look!

414
00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:39.754
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

415
00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:46.136
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

416
00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:09.243
Fuck you.

417
00:47:11.203 --> 00:47:13.747
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

418
00:47:14.415 --> 00:47:16.415
If a subject survives my method...

419
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:19.336
he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

420
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:23.506
Now, you want a chance?

421
00:47:24.926 --> 00:47:26.593
You want a chance?

422
00:47:26.761 --> 00:47:27.928
I'll give you a chance.

423
00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:39.439
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

424
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:43.318
It's your duty to bring me in...

425
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:46.238
but I know who you are...

426
00:47:46.406 --> 00:47:48.906
and I know what you’ve done.

427
00:47:52.787 --> 00:47:54.203
So this is blackmail.

428
00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:55.455
No, no, no.

429
00:47:56.874 --> 00:47:59.126
This is redemption.

430
00:48:03.214 --> 00:48:06.258
Just giving you an option, that's all.

431
00:48:06.968 --> 00:48:09.428
Now, you can arrest me...

432
00:48:09.595 --> 00:48:13.723
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

433
00:48:13.892 --> 00:48:15.225
Or...

434
00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.810
you could explore...

435
00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.439
...a method of rehabilitation...

436
00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:22.982
that'll permit you to sleep at night.

437
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:46.298
Or I could kill you right now.

438
00:48:46.466 --> 00:48:48.841
But you're not a true killer.

439
00:48:49.843 --> 00:48:51.093
That's your dilemma

440
00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:54.765
and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be

441
00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:59.060
and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

442
00:48:59.812 --> 00:49:02.356
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

443
00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:06.984
You willing to take that risk?

444
00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:09.278
Risk of ruining your own life...

445
00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:11.906
in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

446
00:49:12.075 --> 00:49:15.660

back on the streets?
