00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.540
What the...? What the fuck?

2
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.835
What the...?

3
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.090
What the fuck!

4
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.550
Fuck.

5
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.970
Hello?

6
00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:09.850
Fuck.

7
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.860
Hello, Seth.

8
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.400
I wanna play a game.

9
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.780
Right now, you're feeling helpless.

10
00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:24.780
- This is the same helplessness...
- Help!

11
00:02:24.945 --> 00:02:26.900
...you've bestowed onto others.

12
00:02:27.074 --> 00:02:29.117
But now it's onto you.

13
00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:33.121
Some call this karma. I call it justice.

14
00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.290
Now, you served five years...

15
00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:38.459
...of what should have been
a life sentence for murder.

16
00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.753
A technicality gave you freedom...

17
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:45.967
...but it inhibited you from understanding
the impact of taking a life.

18
00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:49.137
Today, I offer you true freedom.

19
00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:54.893
In 30 seconds, the pendulum will drop
far enough to touch your body.

20
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.397
Within sixty seconds
it will cut you in half.

21
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:05.486
To avoid the pendulum, all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed:

22
00:03:05.654 --> 00:03:07.322
Your hands.

23
00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.157
You must insert your hands...

24
00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:12.493
...and push the buttons
to start the devices before you.

25
00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:15.288
Your bones will be crushed to dust.

26
00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:19.500
Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?

27
00:03:19.668 --> 00:03:20.835
Make your choice.

28
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.840
No.

29
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:51.449
It was an accident!

30
00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:58.665
Please.

31
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.214
Okay. Fuck you.

32
00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:22.563
Okay. Okay. Okay.

33
00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:51.569
I did what I was supposed to do.

34
00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:20.395
SAW V

35
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.809
Let me see your hands.
Let me see your fucking hands.

36
00:06:22.976 --> 00:06:24.602
Where is my daughter? You...

37
00:06:35.364 --> 00:06:36.864
Jesus.

38
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:02.950
Hello, Agent Strahm.

39
00:08:03.118 --> 00:08:06.954
If you're hearing this, then you've
finally found what you've been looking for.

40
00:08:07.122 --> 00:08:10.625
But is the discovery
of my body enough?

41
00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:17.006
Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover
the truth push you deeper into the abyss?

42
00:08:17.174 --> 00:08:20.635
Heed my warning: Do not proceed.

43
00:08:20.802 --> 00:08:26.474
For this room can either be
your sanctuary or it can be your grave.

44
00:08:26.975 --> 00:08:28.768
The choice is yours.

45
00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:32.772
Fuck you.

46
00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:40.548
Hey!

47
00:09:41.341 --> 00:10:06.824
Help!

48
00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:34.161
Go! Go!

49
00:11:36.498 --> 00:11:38.040
You're okay.

50
00:11:44.714 --> 00:11:46.507
- Where's my dad?
- He's gonna be okay.

51
00:11:46.675 --> 00:11:49.343
Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?

52
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:52.680
Hoffman.
I got it. I got it.

53
00:11:54.349 --> 00:11:56.016
You okay to walk?

54
00:11:56.184 --> 00:11:58.352
What the hell, man?
What happened? Where's Rigg?

55
00:11:59.938 --> 00:12:03.232
Tried to help. He didn't make it.

56
00:12:03.817 --> 00:12:05.526
Nobody made it.

57
00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:08.320
We got a live one.

58
00:12:48.904 --> 00:12:50.154
Hello?

59
00:12:50.572 --> 00:12:51.864
Right away.

60
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.824
Ms. Tuck.

61
00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:55.618
Have a seat.

62
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:01.957
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Feldman.

63
00:13:03.084 --> 00:13:04.251
Why am I here?

64
00:13:04.794 --> 00:13:07.004
I represent your ex-husband, John.

65
00:13:07.172 --> 00:13:11.550
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

66
00:13:11.718 --> 00:13:16.597
You can understand my surprise
when I found out who he really was.

67
00:13:16.765 --> 00:13:18.933
John left something for you.

68
00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:45.501
If you're watching this, Jill,
I'm long gone from this world.

69
00:13:46.461 --> 00:13:51.799
You are my heart, you always have been.
You always will be.

70
00:13:52.968 --> 00:13:58.389
I'm not going to try to explain
my actions of late.

71
00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:02.893
Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself...

72
00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:04.728
...for what happened at the clinic.

73
00:14:05.438 --> 00:14:11.610
I permitted, indeed, encouraged
your decisions regarding the people there.

74
00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:16.156
I saw danger and I...
I should have acted sooner.

75
00:14:16.324 --> 00:14:22.496
I'm leaving you a box today,
and its contents are of grave importance.

76
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:26.584
Even though you and I don't always see
eye to eye on everything...

77
00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:30.254
...I deeply believe in you
and I believe that you will know...

78
00:14:30.422 --> 00:14:32.840
...what to do with these materials.

79
00:15:34.277 --> 00:15:37.071
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

80
00:15:37.238 --> 00:15:39.323
And I'd like to be the first to say...

81
00:15:39.491 --> 00:15:42.493
...that the Jigsaw murders are over.

82
00:15:44.287 --> 00:15:48.082
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

83
00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:51.585
But today I'd like to offer
a special honor...

84
00:15:51.753 --> 00:15:55.172
...to the detective who's been on this case
right from the beginning...

85
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:59.009
...who proved through hard work
and dedication...

86
00:15:59.177 --> 00:16:02.429
...that the people who died
did not die in vain.

87
00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:06.934
Today we honor the newly promoted
Detective Lieutenant...

88
00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:09.228
...Mark Hoffman.

89
00:16:09.396 --> 00:16:10.938
Congratulations.

90
00:16:11.106 --> 00:16:12.940
Thank you so much.

91
00:16:21.449 --> 00:16:23.075
Thank you. Thank you very much.

92
00:16:23.618 --> 00:16:25.452
Uh, ahem...

93
00:16:26.246 --> 00:16:30.290
Throughout this ordeal,
if we've learned anything it's that...

94
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:32.292
...human life is sacred.

95
00:16:33.128 --> 00:16:36.213
And we've learned that every day...

96
00:16:37.382 --> 00:16:39.550
...life should be cherished.

97
00:16:40.385 --> 00:16:42.094
Justice...

98
00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:46.348
...is the backbone
to every peaceful society.

99
00:16:47.559 --> 00:16:50.769
And I believe that true justice
has been served.

100
00:17:56.377 --> 00:17:58.837
Detective Hoffman,
you're wanted at the hospital.

101
00:17:59.005 --> 00:18:00.547
It's about Agent Perez.

102
00:18:00.715 --> 00:18:02.466
Thank you.

103
00:18:06.137 --> 00:18:11.934
Hello, Agent Perez, and welcome
to the world that you have long studied.

104
00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:14.144
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

105
00:18:14.312 --> 00:18:17.439
Your next move is critical.

106
00:18:17.607 --> 00:18:19.441
- Open the door.
What is that?

107
00:18:24.739 --> 00:18:26.406
I got you.

108
00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:51.265
I'm truly sorry about Agent Perez.

109
00:18:53.351 --> 00:18:55.519
She said your name, you know.

110
00:18:56.437 --> 00:18:59.147
The last thing she said
was "Detective Hoffman. "

111
00:18:59.315 --> 00:19:02.609
Why'd she say that?
Why'd she say your name?

112
00:19:02.777 --> 00:19:04.987
- I don't know.
- No?

113
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.240
How'd you walk out of that building?

114
00:19:08.408 --> 00:19:09.867
How did you?

115
00:19:10.034 --> 00:19:12.619
On a gurney with a fucking hole
in my throat.

116
00:19:15.123 --> 00:19:16.248
Look at you.

117
00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:19.626
Couple of scratches and a story
about how your arm straps broke.

118
00:19:19.794 --> 00:19:21.587
Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

119
00:19:21.754 --> 00:19:24.381
Is this you theorizing again?
Because Jigsaw's dead.

120
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:28.427
I'm not talking about him, I'm talking about
you and your whole crooked department.

121
00:19:28.595 --> 00:19:31.638
My department's gone. They're all dead.
There's no one left.

122
00:19:31.806 --> 00:19:33.390
Besides you.

123
00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:37.269
Been chasing Jigsaw
from the beginning...

124
00:19:37.437 --> 00:19:39.354
...and I got him.

125
00:19:39.522 --> 00:19:41.607
So unless you've got
something else to say...

126
00:19:42.317 --> 00:19:44.484
...back the fuck off.

127
00:19:46.112 --> 00:19:48.572
Read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

128
00:20:04.631 --> 00:20:06.673
Sorry about Agent Perez.

129
00:20:07.717 --> 00:20:09.760
Shouldn't you be resting?

130
00:20:10.678 --> 00:20:12.554
I'm fine, Erickson.

131
00:20:12.722 --> 00:20:16.141
No, you're not, Peter.
That's why I put you on medical leave.

132
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.813
I was supposed to die in that trap.

133
00:20:22.398 --> 00:20:24.983
You never should have been there
without backup.

134
00:20:25.151 --> 00:20:27.945
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

135
00:20:29.113 --> 00:20:31.740
You're no longer handling
the case, Peter.

136
00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:33.784
What?

137
00:20:33.952 --> 00:20:35.369
Read it.

138
00:20:38.373 --> 00:20:41.959
Over a dozen dead bodies were recovered
at the scene, two of which were cops.

139
00:20:42.126 --> 00:20:45.712
Jigsaw's dead, how many lives
did I inevitably save?

140
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.048
By endangering yourself and others.

141
00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:49.383
You're off the case.

142
00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.343
On whose orders?

143
00:20:51.511 --> 00:20:52.928
Mine.

144
00:20:54.389 --> 00:20:56.848
I'm sorry, Peter. It's over.

145
00:22:36.157 --> 00:22:37.491
Oh, my God.

146
00:22:41.788 --> 00:22:43.080
Oh...

147
00:22:43.414 --> 00:22:45.832
- What is this?
- Hey, don't move.

148
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.918
What did you do to me?

149
00:22:48.086 --> 00:22:49.169
I didn't do anything.

150
00:22:49.545 --> 00:22:51.213
- It's Jigsaw.
- What?

151
00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.841
I knew this was gonna happen
to me. This is what he does.

152
00:22:55.927 --> 00:22:57.511
No, it's not Jigsaw.

153
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:01.014
He's dead.

154
00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:03.433
Haven't you watched TV lately?

155
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.769
Yeah, well, whoever it is...

156
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:07.604
...they're watching us.

157
00:23:12.318 --> 00:23:14.111
To make sure we follow the rules.

158
00:23:14.278 --> 00:23:16.696
- Which are what?
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

159
00:23:16.864 --> 00:23:19.324
Unless you want your head
to pop off like a dandelion.

160
00:23:19.492 --> 00:23:21.952
- How do you know that?
- Because I have eyes.

161
00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:25.622
One pull-pin starts the timer
for all of us.

162
00:23:27.375 --> 00:23:31.545
You won't wanna do that unless
you know how it works, now, would you?

163
00:23:32.046 --> 00:23:34.089
You're starting to freak me out, dude.

164
00:23:38.678 --> 00:23:39.719
Hello, and welcome.

165
00:23:40.096 --> 00:23:44.641
From birth, you've all been given
the advantages of few others.

166
00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:47.561
Yet through poor moral decisions...

167
00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:50.730
...you've used these advantages
to selfishly further...

168
00:23:50.898 --> 00:23:54.484
...only yourselves
at the expense of others.

169
00:23:54.652 --> 00:23:58.405
Well, today this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.

170
00:23:58.573 --> 00:24:03.577
Today, five will become one,
with a common goal of survival.

171
00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:04.953
You are all connected.

172
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:07.539
A cable runs through
your collar devices.

173
00:24:07.707 --> 00:24:09.416
It can be pulled so tight...

174
00:24:09.584 --> 00:24:12.419
...that you will be decapitated
on the mounted razors.

175
00:24:13.421 --> 00:24:17.966
The only way to remove the collar
is with the keys from the glass boxes...

176
00:24:18.134 --> 00:24:19.676
...on the pedestals before you.

177
00:24:19.844 --> 00:24:23.013
However, if one of you moves
to retrieve a key...

178
00:24:23.181 --> 00:24:26.558
...the 60-second timer
will begin for you all.

179
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:29.186
In choosing how to react
to this situation...

180
00:24:29.353 --> 00:24:32.397
...your lifelong instincts
will tell you to do one thing...

181
00:24:32.565 --> 00:24:35.734
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

182
00:24:36.944 --> 00:24:38.570
Let the games begin.

183
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.451
Somebody has to die.

184
00:24:44.619 --> 00:24:48.205
No, no, no, it says,
"Don't listen to your instincts. "

185
00:24:48.372 --> 00:24:50.790
- That means don't go for the keys.
- You fucking nuts?

186
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:52.959
How are we supposed to live
if we don't?

187
00:24:53.127 --> 00:24:55.420
- It's testing our endurance.
- We gotta move, babe.

188
00:24:55.588 --> 00:24:57.631
That timer's connected to those jars.

189
00:24:57.798 --> 00:24:59.633
It didn't say anything
about those jars.

190
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.927
- They could be nothing.
They're nail bombs.

191
00:25:02.094 --> 00:25:04.054
Homemade, probably C-4.

192
00:25:04.263 --> 00:25:05.847
How the fuck do you know that?

193
00:25:06.015 --> 00:25:09.184
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

194
00:25:09.352 --> 00:25:11.311
How do you know me?

195
00:25:13.564 --> 00:25:16.608
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

196
00:25:19.487 --> 00:25:22.697
How do you know her? Answer me!

197
00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:25.158
Look, let's just keep our cool.

198
00:25:25.326 --> 00:25:28.495
- Okay, we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

199
00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:32.249
Okay, and we're all connected,
as the message said.

200
00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.084
We just need to...

201
00:25:36.337 --> 00:25:39.339
- What did you do?
- You go first.

202
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.637
It said that we were all born
with advantages.

203
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.139
Right? That means
we're all from money.

204
00:25:51.227 --> 00:25:52.811
- I'm not.
- And neither am I.

205
00:25:52.979 --> 00:25:55.772
Hey, nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

206
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.774
Well, then, what does it mean?

207
00:25:57.942 --> 00:26:00.527
We did something wrong
with an advantage from birth.

208
00:26:00.695 --> 00:26:04.197
- That doesn't have to mean money.
- What are you not telling us? Huh?

209
00:26:04.615 --> 00:26:07.701
You know about her, what do you know
about the rest of us?

210
00:26:07.868 --> 00:26:10.495
Would you fucking talk to me?

211
00:26:10.663 --> 00:26:13.581
- Relax.
- I am fucking relaxed.

212
00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:16.001
It's a game, tweaker.

213
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.714
Get it? The less you know about me,
the better.

214
00:26:20.881 --> 00:26:23.842
The reason why you fucked up
your charmed existence...

215
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:26.303
...is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

216
00:26:28.097 --> 00:26:29.973
Fuck you. Fuck you.

217
00:26:30.141 --> 00:26:32.392
Been playing with matches again,
have we?

218
00:26:32.977 --> 00:26:34.853
Fuck all of you and your fucking plan.

219
00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:24.087
Unless you wanna be shredded
when those bombs go off...

220
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.881
...I suggest we move on.

221
00:28:47.278 --> 00:28:48.820
What are you doing?

222
00:28:48.988 --> 00:28:50.780
Being smart.

223
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:01.958
Special Agent Strahm's office.

224
00:29:02.126 --> 00:29:05.837
This is Detective Hoffman.
Is Agent Strahm available?

225
00:29:06.005 --> 00:29:08.673
He's not, but I can connect you
to Special Agent Erickson.

226
00:29:08.841 --> 00:29:10.383
He's handling all inquiries.

227
00:29:10.551 --> 00:29:11.926
Please.

228
00:29:14.054 --> 00:29:16.473
You've reached
the voice mail box of Agent Erickson.

229
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.725
Please leave a message.

230
00:29:18.893 --> 00:29:21.394
Yeah, this is Detective Hoffman.

231
00:29:21.562 --> 00:29:24.063
I needed to discuss something
with Agent Strahm...

232
00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:26.149
...but I can't seem to track him down.

233
00:29:26.317 --> 00:29:29.736
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

234
00:30:29.964 --> 00:30:32.173
There you are.

235
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.848
Sister.

236
00:31:52.212 --> 00:31:53.630
Peter.

237
00:31:56.383 --> 00:31:59.552
- Cowan, take this to analysis.
- Right away, sir.

238
00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:02.889
What are you doing here?

239
00:32:03.057 --> 00:32:07.560
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
I'm taking your advice.

240
00:32:08.437 --> 00:32:12.023
- Taking some time off, huh?
- Yeah, well, I have to heal up, you know.

241
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:13.274
Mm-hm.

242
00:32:13.525 --> 00:32:16.653
You know, I'll keep in touch.
I'll see you around.

243
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.369
Hoffman.

244
00:33:48.537 --> 00:33:52.290
We got another body.
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

245
00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:55.668
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

246
00:33:56.754 --> 00:33:58.212
Typical bio. Murder convict.

247
00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.965
Served five years,
just released last month.

248
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.012
I know him.

249
00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:08.639
His name's Seth Baxter.

250
00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:11.434
My sister's ex-boyfriend.

251
00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:15.354
This is the guy
that murdered your sister?

252
00:34:15.522 --> 00:34:20.568
He was sentenced to 25 years.
Got it reduced to five on a technicality.

253
00:34:22.112 --> 00:34:24.655
Well, then I'd say justice was served.

254
00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:38.503
You killed him.
Made it look like a Jigsaw trap.

255
00:34:41.006 --> 00:34:42.757
I got you.

256
00:34:47.805 --> 00:34:51.349
Not yet.
- Don't close the door. It'll set off the timer.

257
00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:54.018
Do you know that for sure?
Educated guess.

258
00:34:54.186 --> 00:34:56.395
What we need to do
is figure out who everyone is.

259
00:34:56.563 --> 00:35:00.149
Okay, well, we know that the dead woman
worked for the fire department.

260
00:35:00.317 --> 00:35:02.735
Not anymore.
She got canned a month ago.

261
00:35:02.903 --> 00:35:05.363
How the fuck do you...?
How the fuck do you know that?

262
00:35:05.531 --> 00:35:08.407
You're responsible for this?
She had her fucking head cut off!

263
00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:09.700
I'm closing the door.

264
00:35:09.868 --> 00:35:12.495
- I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Just be quiet.

265
00:35:13.914 --> 00:35:15.540
Please.

266
00:35:19.711 --> 00:35:20.878
What's your story?

267
00:35:21.046 --> 00:35:23.089
I work for
the Department of City Planning.

268
00:35:23.257 --> 00:35:26.592
- Married? Kids?
- No, and no.

269
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.346
- Your turn.
- You're not gonna tell them about Daddy?

270
00:35:33.392 --> 00:35:37.728
- My dad is Richard Gibbs.
- The owner of the Cougars?

271
00:35:37.896 --> 00:35:42.191
He's been trying to build a new stadium
for years. Little did he know...

272
00:35:42.359 --> 00:35:47.738
...all he had to do is wait for his daughter
to get a job in City Planning.

273
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:51.576
And you. What about you?

274
00:35:51.743 --> 00:35:53.953
What sort of shady shit
have you been up to?

275
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:57.039
I'm a senior V.P.
For a real estate development company.

276
00:35:57.207 --> 00:35:59.542
So you're boring too. Hmm?

277
00:36:01.295 --> 00:36:05.006
The Marshvard Group.
Yeah, you can't get a permit in this town...

278
00:36:05.173 --> 00:36:08.342
...without going through
the Department of City Planning.

279
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.178
- Right?
- No, you can't.

280
00:36:11.346 --> 00:36:12.972
What about you?

281
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.473
Uh...

282
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.559
No wife.

283
00:36:16.727 --> 00:36:22.481
- No kids that I know of. No job.
- Trust-fund baby. Anyone surprised?

284
00:36:22.649 --> 00:36:24.984
I'm so fucking sick of
your self-righteousness.

285
00:36:25.152 --> 00:36:26.319
It's your turn.

286
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:31.324
I'm an investigative journalist
for The Herald.

287
00:36:31.491 --> 00:36:34.952
Herald? That's your accomplishment?
You work for a gossip rag?

288
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.954
Bite your fucking tongue.

289
00:36:37.122 --> 00:36:39.665
What the hell are in those jars?

290
00:36:40.709 --> 00:36:44.211
Let's do this fucking thing
before the bombs go off.

291
00:36:50.928 --> 00:36:52.261
Fuck!

292
00:36:53.138 --> 00:36:56.015
Hello, and welcome to the next lesson.

293
00:36:56.183 --> 00:36:59.352
These walls hold four chambers.

294
00:37:01.188 --> 00:37:02.939
These chambers are for safety.

295
00:37:03.106 --> 00:37:05.942
However, to access them,
a key is needed.

296
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:09.695
But only three of the keys
will fit the locks.

297
00:37:09.863 --> 00:37:13.616
These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.

298
00:37:13.784 --> 00:37:16.911
Move quickly, though,
because when the clock ticks down...

299
00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:21.791
...the explosives in the corners
of the room will detonate.

300
00:37:21.959 --> 00:37:26.712
With only three points of safety,
which of you will be the odd man out?

301
00:37:27.422 --> 00:37:29.048
Make your choice.

302
00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.386
Fuck.

303
00:37:40.227 --> 00:37:43.062
Fuck, it's blank. I need a shape.

304
00:37:45.983 --> 00:37:48.401
Get your hands off that,
you're not going anywhere.

305
00:37:50.988 --> 00:37:53.406
- Stop it!
Get a clue, you fucking bitch.

306
00:37:53.573 --> 00:37:55.574
It's survival of the fittest.

307
00:38:10.924 --> 00:38:12.717
Blank.

308
00:38:13.885 --> 00:38:15.261
Blank.

309
00:38:18.557 --> 00:38:20.016
Shit.

310
00:38:20.684 --> 00:38:22.727
I got it. Got it.

311
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.615
Yes.

312
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:46.208
Better luck next time, rich boy.

313
00:38:48.295 --> 00:38:50.087
Survival of the fittest, my ass!

314
00:39:03.935 --> 00:39:05.311
Wait.

315
00:39:29.503 --> 00:39:32.505
Everything all right with
Detective Kerr in the Seth Baxter case?

316
00:39:32.672 --> 00:39:33.756
- Yeah.
- Good.

317
00:39:33.924 --> 00:39:36.801
Fisk. You keep me posted.

318
00:39:36.968 --> 00:39:39.512
- Will do.
- Good.

319
00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:44.433
After Seth,
you were involved in every investigation.

320
00:39:52.776 --> 00:39:54.944
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

321
00:40:59.384 --> 00:41:01.635
Stop it, stop it!

322
00:41:12.397 --> 00:41:13.814
Don't!

323
00:41:19.154 --> 00:41:21.614
Heel! Heel, I said!

324
00:41:21.781 --> 00:41:23.699
Don't provoke him. Asshole!

325
00:41:24.784 --> 00:41:27.953
Jesus Christ.
Come on, Peewee. Come on.

326
00:41:28.121 --> 00:41:30.456
- Come on, Peewee.
- Peewee.

327
00:41:30.624 --> 00:41:32.041
Shit.

328
00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:38.214
Do you mind?

329
00:41:44.471 --> 00:41:46.597
Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

330
00:42:07.827 --> 00:42:09.912
What floor are you going to?

331
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.550
I think we're both going
to the same place.

332
00:42:55.625 --> 00:42:58.085
You know why you're here, don't you?

333
00:43:00.255 --> 00:43:04.717
They say imitation
is the sincerest form of flattery.

334
00:43:06.594 --> 00:43:09.972
But I find it somewhat distasteful...

335
00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.975
...to be given credit for work
that's not mine.

336
00:43:18.815 --> 00:43:20.983
Especially inferior work.

337
00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:29.408
Like you,
I know what it's like to lose family.

338
00:43:30.827 --> 00:43:34.204
I know what it's like
not to be able to protect loved ones.

339
00:43:35.123 --> 00:43:37.750
It's a powerless feeling.

340
00:43:42.922 --> 00:43:44.089
I wouldn't do that.

341
00:43:50.263 --> 00:43:51.680
Hair trigger.

342
00:43:54.517 --> 00:43:56.435
What do you see?

343
00:43:57.771 --> 00:43:59.271
Hm?

344
00:44:00.106 --> 00:44:03.150
Vengeance can change a person.
Make you into something...

345
00:44:03.318 --> 00:44:06.278
...you never thought
you were capable of being.

346
00:44:07.864 --> 00:44:11.283
But unlike you, I've never killed anyone.

347
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:14.787
- I give people a chance.
- You call this a chance?

348
00:44:14.954 --> 00:44:16.872
We'll see.

349
00:44:18.041 --> 00:44:23.128
- Our game's just begun.
- Our game? You don't even know me.

350
00:44:23.296 --> 00:44:24.797
Oh.

351
00:44:25.215 --> 00:44:29.968
I know you.
lâ€™ve followed you as you've pursued me.

352
00:44:30.136 --> 00:44:33.263
I know you. I know about your sister.

353
00:44:33.431 --> 00:44:35.891
I know how you cared for her.

354
00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:44.274
I know she was your only family.

355
00:44:44.484 --> 00:44:46.318
Leave me alone.

356
00:44:49.823 --> 00:44:51.240
No!

357
00:44:58.873 --> 00:45:02.960
You sit in bars until closing.
You drink so you can sleep.

358
00:45:03.128 --> 00:45:04.628
You stagger to your car...

359
00:45:04.796 --> 00:45:08.882
...and then you start it all over again
the next day.

360
00:45:12.262 --> 00:45:15.681
Then I discovered
what you do for recreation.

361
00:45:20.061 --> 00:45:21.603
Mm.

362
00:45:22.188 --> 00:45:23.981
You can dispense justice...

363
00:45:24.149 --> 00:45:28.193
...and give people a chance
to value their lives in the same moment.

364
00:45:29.904 --> 00:45:31.738
And by the way...

365
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.033
...the blade on your pendulum
was inferior.

366
00:45:36.536 --> 00:45:39.413
If you want a true edge...

367
00:45:42.417 --> 00:45:44.668
...you have to used tempered steel.

368
00:45:44.836 --> 00:45:47.838
Tempering's better for the long haul.

369
00:45:48.006 --> 00:45:50.048
You in this for the long haul, detective?

370
00:45:51.593 --> 00:45:54.803
lâ€™ve been a cop for 20 years.
Is that long enough for you?

371
00:45:54.971 --> 00:45:59.057
Then you and I both know the statistics
for repeat offenders in this city.

372
00:45:59.225 --> 00:46:04.313
67.5 percent of criminals
are back in prison within three years.

373
00:46:04.481 --> 00:46:06.023
What do you want from me?

374
00:46:06.566 --> 00:46:10.194
So you might look at what you did to Seth
as a kind of public service.

375
00:46:11.905 --> 00:46:15.032
She was my only family.
He didn't deserve a chance.

376
00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:17.826
- He was an animal.
- Everybody deserves a chance!

377
00:46:17.994 --> 00:46:19.912
You didn't see the blood!

378
00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:22.331
You didn't see
what he fucking did to her!

379
00:46:22.499 --> 00:46:25.918
Killing is distasteful...

380
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.004
...to me.

381
00:46:32.091 --> 00:46:36.261
There is a better, more efficient way.

382
00:46:44.229 --> 00:46:46.855
What do you see...? Look!

383
00:46:47.273 --> 00:46:50.484
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want.

384
00:46:52.403 --> 00:46:56.865
I wanna know if you have
what it takes to survive.

385
00:47:16.386 --> 00:47:19.972
Fuck you.

386
00:47:21.933 --> 00:47:24.476
You see, it's a different method
that I'm talking about.

387
00:47:25.144 --> 00:47:27.145
If a subject survives my method...

388
00:47:27.564 --> 00:47:30.065
...he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

389
00:47:32.151 --> 00:47:34.236
Now, you want a chance?

390
00:47:35.655 --> 00:47:37.322
You want a chance?

391
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:38.657
I'll give you a chance.

392
00:47:47.083 --> 00:47:50.168
I'm the man you call Jigsaw.

393
00:47:51.838 --> 00:47:54.047
It's your duty to bring me in...

394
00:47:54.215 --> 00:47:56.967
...but I know who you are...

395
00:47:57.135 --> 00:47:59.636
...and I know what youâ€™ve done.

396
00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:04.933
So this is blackmail.

397
00:48:05.101 --> 00:48:06.184
No, no, no.

398
00:48:07.604 --> 00:48:09.855
This is redemption.

399
00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:16.987
Just giving you an option, that's all.

400
00:48:17.697 --> 00:48:20.157
Now, you can arrest me...

401
00:48:20.325 --> 00:48:24.453
...but doing so,
your life ends as you know it.

402
00:48:24.621 --> 00:48:25.954
Or...

403
00:48:26.122 --> 00:48:27.539
...you could explore...

404
00:48:28.791 --> 00:48:31.168
...a method of rehabilitation...

405
00:48:31.336 --> 00:48:33.712
...that'll permit you to sleep at night.

406
00:48:55.401 --> 00:48:57.027
Or I could kill you right now.

407
00:48:57.195 --> 00:48:59.571
But you're not a true killer.

408
00:49:00.573 --> 00:49:01.823
That's your dilemma...

409
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:05.494
...and the information that I have on you
is exactly where it needs to be...

410
00:49:05.662 --> 00:49:09.790
...and it will be released
in the event of my disappearance.

411
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:13.085
They'll never believe your word
over mine.

412
00:49:15.588 --> 00:49:17.714
You willing to take that risk?

413
00:49:17.882 --> 00:49:20.008
Risk of ruining your own life...

414
00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:22.636
...in order to protect
a corrupt legal system...

415
00:49:22.804 --> 00:49:26.390
...that puts murderers
back on the streets?

416
00:49:32.105 --> 00:49:34.189
How would your sister feel?

417
00:49:34.357 --> 00:49:36.441
You're at a crossroads, detective.

418
00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:39.277
Make your choice.

419
00:50:01.342 --> 00:50:03.802
Did you help Jigsaw get all of them?

420
00:50:50.767 --> 00:50:54.519
Detective Hoffman,
this is Special Agent Erickson.

421
00:50:54.687 --> 00:50:58.356
You had something you needed to discuss
about the Jigsaw case?

422
00:50:58.524 --> 00:51:02.861
Yes. I stopped by Agent Strahm's room
tonight at the hospital, but he wasn't there.

423
00:51:03.029 --> 00:51:05.280
- I hope he's all right.
- Oh, yeah, he's fine.

424
00:51:05.448 --> 00:51:07.866
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility...

425
00:51:08.034 --> 00:51:11.286
...of an additional accomplice
to Jigsaw, other than Amanda Young.

426
00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:14.998
Someone who might be
currently unknown.

427
00:51:15.166 --> 00:51:17.918
Did he ever mention
anything like that to you?

428
00:51:18.085 --> 00:51:20.253
No, but then again, I'm new to the case.

429
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:24.132
Yeah, well, maybe you could get him
to contact me at his earliest convenience.

430
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.676
Will do. And...

431
00:51:26.844 --> 00:51:28.970
...in your theorizing...

432
00:51:29.138 --> 00:51:31.681
...who exactly did you suspect
would be an accomplice?

433
00:51:33.392 --> 00:51:35.852
Well, he suspected
someone on the inside.

434
00:51:36.062 --> 00:51:37.270
Someone with access.

435
00:51:37.438 --> 00:51:39.731
It's an interesting theory.

436
00:51:39.899 --> 00:51:43.193
Detective, what do you say we reconnect
in the morning?

437
00:51:43.653 --> 00:51:45.237
You got it.

438
00:52:28.614 --> 00:52:29.948
Dead.

439
00:52:30.116 --> 00:52:32.951
That guy was an asshole,
but he was smart.

440
00:52:33.119 --> 00:52:34.244
We could've used him.

441
00:52:34.745 --> 00:52:37.122
Yeah, well, someone had to die.

442
00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:41.293
Would you rather it'd been you?

443
00:53:40.353 --> 00:53:41.937
How'd they get you?

444
00:54:53.134 --> 00:54:54.509
Screw you!

445
00:54:55.094 --> 00:54:58.430
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!

446
00:55:04.603 --> 00:55:06.896
I'm gonna kill...

447
00:55:49.607 --> 00:55:51.649
Hello, Paul.

448
00:55:51.817 --> 00:55:54.903
Did you cut yourself
because you truly wanted to die...

449
00:55:55.071 --> 00:55:58.823
...or did you just want some attention?

450
00:55:58.991 --> 00:56:00.658
Tonight, you'll show me.

451
00:56:00.826 --> 00:56:04.954
If you want to live,
you'll have to cut yourself again.

452
00:56:06.415 --> 00:56:10.376
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Paul?

453
00:57:00.928 --> 00:57:03.930
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

454
00:57:04.515 --> 00:57:06.474
The heart cannot be involved.

455
00:57:06.642 --> 00:57:09.769
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

456
00:57:09.937 --> 00:57:12.605
It can never be personal.

457
00:57:12.982 --> 00:57:15.400
- Let's go.
- No.

458
00:57:15.568 --> 00:57:17.652
You're not done yet.

459
00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:22.907
Tonight you will see the difference
between killing and rehabilitation.

460
00:57:35.254 --> 00:57:38.923
There is another detective
that you should be aware of.

461
00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:40.758
His name's Tapp.

462
00:57:40.926 --> 00:57:43.344
He's smart, and he's getting closer.

463
00:57:43.512 --> 00:57:45.638
I know who he is.

464
00:57:49.518 --> 00:57:52.937
I need you to lead him
to someone for me.

465
00:57:55.149 --> 00:57:57.108
A doctor.

466
00:57:58.277 --> 00:58:01.404
A healer who needs some healing.

467
00:58:05.159 --> 00:58:07.535
Is this yours, doctor?

468
00:58:15.044 --> 00:58:18.546
You supplied these police files,
didn't you?

469
00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:53.623
You're assuming this is gonna play out
the way you want it.

470
00:58:53.791 --> 00:58:55.875
I assume nothing.

471
00:59:00.547 --> 00:59:06.302
I anticipate the possibilities,
and I let the game play out.

472
00:59:06.804 --> 00:59:09.681
Then why do you need Amanda
in the game?

473
00:59:12.351 --> 00:59:15.520
To ensure that the rules are followed.

474
00:59:16.855 --> 00:59:20.900
She won't make decisions for anyone.
She'll just...

475
00:59:22.152 --> 00:59:24.320
...offer choices.

476
00:59:26.198 --> 00:59:28.366
Little to your left.

477
00:59:36.208 --> 00:59:38.584
That leaves a lot to chance.

478
00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:57.395
If you're good
at anticipating the human mind...

479
01:00:02.985 --> 01:00:05.820
...it leaves nothing to chance.

480
01:00:18.917 --> 01:00:20.543
It's time.

481
01:00:38.354 --> 01:00:40.772
Jesus Christ.

482
01:00:45.569 --> 01:00:48.196
Great. More bombs.

483
01:00:51.909 --> 01:00:54.744
All right. What'd you do to get here?

484
01:00:54.912 --> 01:00:59.499
L... I did something,
and a bunch of people were killed.

485
01:00:59.666 --> 01:01:01.292
I didn't mean to.

486
01:01:02.211 --> 01:01:04.754
They're still dead.

487
01:01:04.922 --> 01:01:06.798
- That's why you're here?
- Yeah.

488
01:01:06.965 --> 01:01:09.967
Shouldn't you have
gone to jail for something like that?

489
01:01:10.135 --> 01:01:12.220
Nobody else knows.

490
01:01:16.725 --> 01:01:18.142
Somebody does.

491
01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:30.571
I didn't kill anybody,
if that's what you're asking.

492
01:01:30.739 --> 01:01:32.073
I wasn't.

493
01:01:33.575 --> 01:01:35.660
I grant building permits.

494
01:01:38.622 --> 01:01:41.791
And yeah, some people might have been
more deserving than others...

495
01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:44.001
...but you know what?
That's the business.

496
01:01:44.169 --> 01:01:46.921
So if someone tells you different,
then they're just stupid.

497
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:49.632
Or naive. Or both.

498
01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.967
Bullshit.

499
01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:55.096
You take bribes. You're a fucking liar.
You cheat people. That's not nice.

500
01:01:55.264 --> 01:01:56.848
Yeah, well.

501
01:01:57.015 --> 01:02:00.393
I'm sure she's not exactly
Mother Teresa either.

502
01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:02.228
No, I'm not.

503
01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:06.732
I build condos in one of the most
densely populated cities in the country.

504
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:10.486
You don't put up a new building
without tearing down a few old ones.

505
01:02:10.654 --> 01:02:14.282
So we're all bags of shit that deserve
to be here. That's good. That's great.

506
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:15.491
Fucking great.

507
01:02:15.659 --> 01:02:17.994
So is that what you think this is?

508
01:02:18.162 --> 01:02:20.204
You don't think there's
any other connection?

509
01:02:20.372 --> 01:02:22.206
No, I do.

510
01:02:22.374 --> 01:02:24.709
I do. And I don't give a shit.

511
01:02:24.877 --> 01:02:28.004
Close the fucking door.
We have to hear the rules.

512
01:02:39.099 --> 01:02:40.558
Hello, and welcome.

513
01:02:40.726 --> 01:02:46.314
You must all be eager to learn the next
important lesson in your transformation.

514
01:02:46.482 --> 01:02:51.235
The game before you is designed
to bridge the gap between you all.

515
01:02:51.403 --> 01:02:55.072
In order to open the five locks
on the door out of this room...

516
01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.993
...the five electrical circuits
powering them must be closed.

517
01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:05.917
The only way to do this is to find a way
to connect all five cords to the bath water.

518
01:03:06.084 --> 01:03:09.253
Close the circuits
and the door will open.

519
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:10.755
But you must work quickly...

520
01:03:10.923 --> 01:03:14.425
...for in three minutes, an electrical current
will surge through this room...

521
01:03:14.593 --> 01:03:17.345
...locking the door forever.

522
01:03:17.513 --> 01:03:21.766
Who will bridge the gap?
The choice is yours.

523
01:03:24.937 --> 01:03:26.562
Jesus Christ.

524
01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:34.862
It's not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

525
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.572
Come on!

526
01:03:38.534 --> 01:03:40.576
You're gonna get in the tub...

527
01:03:41.203 --> 01:03:43.621
...and we're gonna connect the five cords
to you.

528
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:45.206
But you're gonna kill me too.

529
01:03:47.376 --> 01:03:49.961
- Get in.
- Yeah, I'm more of a shower guy.

530
01:03:50.128 --> 01:03:53.256
- I don't think I'm gonna do that right now.
- Get in the fucking tub.

531
01:03:53.423 --> 01:03:55.967
Fuck you, you bitch.
You get in the fucking tub.

532
01:03:57.469 --> 01:03:58.970
No, don't do it.

533
01:03:59.137 --> 01:04:00.846
Please, no.

534
01:04:11.483 --> 01:04:14.610
You killed her.
You fucking killed her.

535
01:04:14.778 --> 01:04:16.654
I didn't trust her.

536
01:04:16.822 --> 01:04:19.490
Jesus Christ. What is it with you two?

537
01:04:19.658 --> 01:04:22.159
Just shut up and help me with the body.

538
01:04:39.261 --> 01:04:42.847
Hey, hey. No.
Don't let your body touch hers.

539
01:05:10.876 --> 01:05:13.044
Oh, my God, it's a hook.

540
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:19.050
Stick it in her head or we don't get out.

541
01:05:22.012 --> 01:05:23.971
Just do it

542
01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:45.743
Come in.

543
01:05:47.287 --> 01:05:50.081
Sir. It's Jill Tuck.

544
01:05:50.248 --> 01:05:51.916
Good evening.

545
01:05:52.084 --> 01:05:53.250
Special Agent Erickson.

546
01:05:53.418 --> 01:05:55.378
Thank you for seeing me
so late in the day.

547
01:05:55.545 --> 01:05:56.712
Not a problem.

548
01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.464
That'll be all.

549
01:05:59.925 --> 01:06:02.510
Please, have a seat.

550
01:06:03.762 --> 01:06:07.264
So, what do you need from us?

551
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:10.101
I think I'm being followed.

552
01:06:10.268 --> 01:06:12.603
Well, that sounds more like
police work, Miss Tuck.

553
01:06:14.272 --> 01:06:16.440
I don't think they can help me.

554
01:06:16.608 --> 01:06:20.569
- Because?
- Because it's you. The FBI.

555
01:06:22.447 --> 01:06:23.948
I don't understand.

556
01:06:24.116 --> 01:06:27.410
It started when John was first identified
as the Jigsaw killer.

557
01:06:27.577 --> 01:06:30.287
It didn't surprise me then,
but I'm still being followed.

558
01:06:30.455 --> 01:06:33.958
By who, Miss Tuck?
Who would be following you?

559
01:06:34.126 --> 01:06:36.127
I think it's the agent
who interrogated me.

560
01:06:37.212 --> 01:06:38.546
Agent Strahm.

561
01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:43.634
- And why would he be following you?
- I don't know.

562
01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:51.809
- Who else have you told about this?
- Only you.

563
01:07:17.294 --> 01:07:19.336
What's going on with Amanda?

564
01:07:19.504 --> 01:07:23.174
Didn't you tell me
the only way to truly offer enlightenment...

565
01:07:23.633 --> 01:07:25.468
...is by detaching emotionally?

566
01:07:29.014 --> 01:07:31.807
But you can have something
Amanda doesn't.

567
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:34.310
Anonymity.

568
01:07:34.478 --> 01:07:38.189
That's the greatest protection.
That's what I've given you.

569
01:07:38.815 --> 01:07:41.484
I need you to set up a game...

570
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.113
...that may not be entirely clear to you
right now.

571
01:07:47.324 --> 01:07:49.950
But I assure you that
the people being tested...

572
01:07:51.036 --> 01:07:53.871
...are part of something much larger.

573
01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:56.040
They're connected.

574
01:07:56.208 --> 01:08:02.046
So in the end,
all the pieces will fit together...

575
01:08:04.132 --> 01:08:06.217
...and it'll be clear.

576
01:08:08.595 --> 01:08:09.970
Who are you?

577
01:08:10.263 --> 01:08:13.724
- Amanda will fail you.
- We'll see.

578
01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:17.144
What are you doing?

579
01:08:23.401 --> 01:08:26.904
What's this?
- It's time to play a game.

580
01:08:28.907 --> 01:08:30.282
Help.

581
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:32.368
Help me. What is this?

582
01:08:32.536 --> 01:08:34.703
What is this? Please.

583
01:08:36.581 --> 01:08:42.044
Why are you keeping me here?
What is this place? What is this place?

584
01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:17.288
We were all supposed to die.

585
01:09:21.251 --> 01:09:23.961
He's just fucking testing you.

586
01:09:24.129 --> 01:09:25.796
Where is my daughter?

587
01:09:29.134 --> 01:09:31.051
Help!

588
01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:33.178
He didn't make it.

589
01:09:33.638 --> 01:09:35.514
Nobody made it.

590
01:09:35.807 --> 01:09:37.892
You were supposed to be the hero.

591
01:10:16.514 --> 01:10:18.557
Peter, where the hell are you?

592
01:10:21.227 --> 01:10:22.853
Hello?

593
01:10:32.697 --> 01:10:35.699
You've reached the voice mail
for Special Agent Peter Strahm.

594
01:10:35.867 --> 01:10:37.660
Leave a message.

595
01:10:40.538 --> 01:10:44.124
Cowan, I wanna put a locator
on Strahm's mobile phone.

596
01:10:44.918 --> 01:10:46.543
Right away, sir.

597
01:10:46.711 --> 01:10:48.253
Call me right back.

598
01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:50.005
Right.

599
01:11:50.442 --> 01:11:53.736
- What the hell is that?
- It's our next nightmare.

600
01:11:59.868 --> 01:12:02.244
There are blades in here.

601
01:12:06.624 --> 01:12:08.625
It's connected to the door.

602
01:12:08.793 --> 01:12:11.045
When the beaker fills up,
the door opens.

603
01:12:13.923 --> 01:12:15.841
Fills with what?

604
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:20.471
Blood. Our blood.

605
01:12:21.306 --> 01:12:26.351
I think an arm is supposed to go in there
to fill the beaker.

606
01:12:26.853 --> 01:12:29.772
Wait. Why can't we just use
the water from the other room?

607
01:12:29.981 --> 01:12:31.148
No, the slots are closed.

608
01:12:31.316 --> 01:12:34.443
We have to stick our arm in to
keep them open, but they'd get stuck.

609
01:12:34.611 --> 01:12:36.403
We need to close that door.

610
01:12:37.989 --> 01:12:39.490
So, what?

611
01:12:40.075 --> 01:12:45.329
We fight to the death, and one gets
to freedom with the other person's blood?

612
01:12:50.794 --> 01:12:52.002
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

613
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.338
Do you still have the keys
from that first room?

614
01:12:54.506 --> 01:12:56.799
- Yeah.
- Try one of them on that door.

615
01:12:56.966 --> 01:13:00.094
- It won't work.
- No, it might. This one has a keyhole.

616
01:13:05.016 --> 01:13:07.476
It... It's not even the same lock.

617
01:13:10.855 --> 01:13:12.981
Wait, why are there five slots
in this machine?

618
01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:15.692
Shouldn't there only be one?

619
01:13:22.617 --> 01:13:24.618
They all would have worked.

620
01:13:49.352 --> 01:13:50.894
There you are, Strahm.

621
01:13:51.896 --> 01:13:54.898
All right. I got him.

622
01:14:02.532 --> 01:14:04.741
I don't think this is a good idea.

623
01:14:04.909 --> 01:14:06.994
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

624
01:14:07.162 --> 01:14:09.079
We were supposed to hold
one cable each...

625
01:14:09.247 --> 01:14:11.623
...and suffer a small shock.

626
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.417
It was meant for five people.

627
01:14:13.585 --> 01:14:15.836
They all were. Every game.

628
01:14:16.004 --> 01:14:18.505
We only needed one key
in the first room.

629
01:14:18.673 --> 01:14:22.301
They all worked, and any one of them
would have opened every collar.

630
01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:26.722
In the second room, the three tubes were
large enough for more than one person.

631
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:29.933
We were supposed to work together
so we all survived.

632
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:31.768
That's the game.

633
01:14:31.936 --> 01:14:34.104
Your instincts will tell you to do
one thing...

634
01:14:34.272 --> 01:14:36.356
...but I implore you to do the opposite.

635
01:14:36.524 --> 01:14:38.066
Oh, God.

636
01:14:38.234 --> 01:14:41.153
Yeah. Big fucking whoops.

637
01:14:56.377 --> 01:14:58.045
Hello, and welcome.

638
01:14:58.213 --> 01:15:00.088
This journey
has been one of discovery...

639
01:15:00.256 --> 01:15:04.551
...and hopefully you've discovered that the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

640
01:15:05.261 --> 01:15:09.264
The human body, for instance,
is an astoundingly durable creation.

641
01:15:09.432 --> 01:15:12.184
It contains approximately 10 pints
of blood...

642
01:15:12.352 --> 01:15:16.355
...yet it is still able to operate
with just half of that.

643
01:15:16.522 --> 01:15:19.274
The device before you is
one of sacrifice.

644
01:15:19.442 --> 01:15:20.943
A sacrifice of blood.

645
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:25.572
In order to open the door, the beaker
must be filled to the marked level...

646
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:29.117
...a level that is of no coincidence.

647
01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:31.536
This amount can come
from any one of you.

648
01:15:31.704 --> 01:15:35.249
That does not matter.
What does matter is time.

649
01:15:35.416 --> 01:15:38.126
For in 15 minutes,
if the beaker is not filled...

650
01:15:38.294 --> 01:15:42.547
...the bombs will explode
and the doors will be sealed forever.

651
01:15:42.715 --> 01:15:47.594
So now I ask you, how much blood
will you give in order to survive?

652
01:15:53.685 --> 01:15:55.310
Fuck! Fuck.

653
01:15:55.937 --> 01:16:01.233
All right, so one person can fill the beaker
with ten pints of blood and die.

654
01:16:01.442 --> 01:16:03.402
Or two people can fill it...

655
01:16:03.569 --> 01:16:05.612
...with five pints...

656
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:07.864
...and maybe live.

657
01:16:09.284 --> 01:16:10.534
What are we gonna do?

658
01:16:42.734 --> 01:16:43.984
I lied.

659
01:16:45.486 --> 01:16:48.572
I know the investigative journalist in there.
His name is Charles.

660
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.366
He was writing a story about what I did.

661
01:16:52.577 --> 01:16:54.411
What'd you do?

662
01:16:56.247 --> 01:16:58.415
A dealer gave me...

663
01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:01.960
...an ounce of heroin to burn down
an abandoned building.

664
01:17:02.128 --> 01:17:03.170
But it wa...

665
01:17:03.338 --> 01:17:06.423
Oh, God. It wasn't abandoned.
There was eight people in there.

666
01:17:06.591 --> 01:17:09.968
Eight people died.

667
01:17:10.261 --> 01:17:13.764
And the feds got involved.

668
01:17:13.931 --> 01:17:16.600
And I got caught but I made a deal
and my dad got me off.

669
01:17:16.768 --> 01:17:20.103
The guy who hired me disappeared
and nothing happened. Nothing happened.

670
01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:48.924
That's how she knew me.

671
01:17:49.092 --> 01:17:51.301
The woman in the tub.

672
01:17:52.011 --> 01:17:54.429
The fire. It's what connects us.

673
01:17:55.181 --> 01:17:58.350
The fire inspector who wrote
the bogus accident report...

674
01:17:58.518 --> 01:18:02.479
...the city planner who pushed through
the residential permits...

675
01:18:02.855 --> 01:18:06.441
...the journalist that buried
the investigative story...

676
01:18:06.609 --> 01:18:09.569
...the rich-kid junkie
who was the patsy...

677
01:18:09.737 --> 01:18:12.656
...and the real estate developer
who set it all in motion.

678
01:18:13.324 --> 01:18:17.577
We killed eight people
and stole the property, and nobody cared.

679
01:18:18.371 --> 01:18:19.454
Nobody cared?

680
01:18:19.997 --> 01:18:22.666
Eight people and their families cared.

681
01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:26.503
The feds cared. Look at my fucking arm.
I cared! I cared!

682
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:28.630
But you didn't face justice.

683
01:18:29.173 --> 01:18:30.257
None of us did.

684
01:18:30.425 --> 01:18:32.676
Why did they all do it?

685
01:18:32.844 --> 01:18:33.969
Why? Was it for money?

686
01:18:34.846 --> 01:18:37.347
This was your plan?
You were the one behind it?

687
01:18:38.182 --> 01:18:42.352
There was eight people in that building.
You had to know that. Did you know that?

688
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:45.188
You're a monster.

689
01:18:49.777 --> 01:18:51.111
So are you.

690
01:18:51.904 --> 01:18:54.823
We both deserve to be here.

691
01:19:47.752 --> 01:19:50.420
I can't do this alone. Look at me.
I can't do this alone.

692
01:19:50.588 --> 01:19:51.671
Okay. It's okay.

693
01:20:17.114 --> 01:20:18.365
We have to go on three.

694
01:20:36.801 --> 01:20:37.801
One.

695
01:20:45.851 --> 01:20:47.769
Two.

696
01:20:51.566 --> 01:20:53.775
Put your hand in the hole!

697
01:21:02.159 --> 01:21:03.785
Three!

698
01:22:32.917 --> 01:22:34.334
Hello, Agent Strahm.

699
01:22:34.794 --> 01:22:39.547
If you are hearing this, then you have
once again found what you're looking for.

700
01:22:39.715 --> 01:22:41.091
Or so you think.

701
01:22:41.258 --> 01:22:44.135
Your dedication is to be commended.

702
01:22:44.303 --> 01:22:48.973
But I ask you if you have learned anything
on your journey of discovery.

703
01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:51.017
As the old adage goes:

704
01:22:51.185 --> 01:22:56.690
"Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, shame on me. "

705
01:22:57.149 --> 01:23:01.319
The situation you find yourself in
is one of trust.

706
01:23:01.487 --> 01:23:05.949
So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned to trust me?

707
01:23:06.117 --> 01:23:11.454
The only way to survive this room
is by entering the glass box before you.

708
01:23:11.622 --> 01:23:16.626
Pain will be incurred,
but you have a chance of survival.

709
01:23:44.655 --> 01:23:45.780
We did it.

710
01:23:45.948 --> 01:23:49.117
We won.

711
01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:39.936
I got you, you motherfucker.

712
01:26:01.959 --> 01:26:03.251
Drop it!

713
01:26:03.419 --> 01:26:05.420
I said drop it!

714
01:26:11.802 --> 01:26:14.971
Who did this to you?

715
01:26:17.558 --> 01:26:20.810
We won.

716
01:26:20.978 --> 01:26:23.313
We worked together.

717
01:26:33.782 --> 01:26:38.536
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandburst Drive.

718
01:27:18.744 --> 01:27:20.828
Jesus, Peter.

719
01:27:37.221 --> 01:27:38.972
Tell me how to open it.

720
01:27:39.390 --> 01:27:40.390
How do I open it?

721
01:27:53.404 --> 01:27:57.156
However, if you choose not to,
you will never be heard from again.

722
01:27:57.324 --> 01:27:59.534
Your body will never be found.

723
01:27:59.702 --> 01:28:01.577
You will simply vanish.

724
01:28:02.413 --> 01:28:08.251
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm,
have you learned enough to trust me?

725
01:28:08.419 --> 01:28:10.169
Will you heed my warning?

726
01:28:10.337 --> 01:28:12.255
- For if you do not...
- Fuck you.

727
01:28:12.423 --> 01:28:14.799
...this room will forever be your tomb.

728
01:28:14.967 --> 01:28:18.094
And my legacy will become yours.

729
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:21.097
If you're good at anticipating
the human mind...

730
01:28:21.265 --> 01:28:23.933
- I think I'm being followed.
- Who would be following you?

731
01:28:24.101 --> 01:28:26.436
I wanna talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

732
01:28:26.603 --> 01:28:28.855
He suspected someone on the inside.

733
01:28:31.233 --> 01:28:33.568
- It leaves nothing to chance.

734
01:28:36.947 --> 01:28:38.614
We were all supposed to die.

735
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:41.617
You were supposed to be the hero.

736
01:28:45.289 --> 01:28:46.706
Make your choice.

737
01:28:51.545 --> 01:28:53.087
Cowan.

738
01:28:53.255 --> 01:28:54.464
Yeah, this is Erickson.

739
01:28:54.631 --> 01:28:57.050
I want you to put out an APB.

740
01:28:57.468 --> 01:29:00.261
Suspect's name is Peter Strahm.

741
01:29:00.679 --> 01:29:02.388
Yeah, that's right.

742
01:29:02.556 --> 01:29:04.600
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

743
01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:29.455
I'm gonna stop you, you son of a bitch.

744
01:29:32.795 --> 01:29:35.670
I know who you are. I know.
