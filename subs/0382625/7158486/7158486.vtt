1
00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.326
Stop now.

2
00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:17.962
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:27.468
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:31.977
I don't know what you are talking about.

5
00:02:32.343 --> 00:02:35.017
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.061
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:39.855
Wait!

8
00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.486
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.115
In the sacristy,

10
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.040
the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:56.038
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:58.494 --> 00:02:59.871
Thank you.

13
00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:35.030
Thank you.

14
00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:37.033
Thank you.

15
00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:53.141
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:57.850
As the saying goes, a
picture says a thousand words,

17
00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:00.932
but which words?

18
00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:05.649
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind. Anybody?

19
00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:08.072
-Hatred, racism.
-Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:13.571
Yes, yes, interesting. But they
would disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:16.994
There, they are robes worn by priests.

22
00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.576
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:20.785
Evil.

24
00:04:22.036 --> 00:04:23.288
In English, please.

25
00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:24.629
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:26.924
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:29.214
That is his trident.

28
00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:33.093
A symbol of power to
millions of the ancients.

29
00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.344
Now this symbol.

30
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:37.556
-Madonna and child.
-Faith. Christianity.

31
00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:41.272
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother Isis

32
00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.317
centuries before the birth of Christ.

33
00:04:44.392 --> 00:04:48.192
Understanding our
past determines actively

34
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.490
our ability to understand the present.

35
00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:55.741
So how do we sift truth from belief?

36
00:04:56.445 --> 00:04:59.790
How do we write our own
histories, personally or culturally,

37
00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:02.038
and thereby define ourselves?

38
00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:06.919
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion

39
00:05:06.997 --> 00:05:10.126
to find original truth?

40
00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:13.637
Tonight, this will be our quest.

41
00:05:13.754 --> 00:05:16.758
My son is a student of yours at Harvard.

42
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.219
-Michael Culp? He adores you.
-Oh, yeah.

43
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:21.395
He says you're the best
teacher he's ever had.

44
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.270
Ms. Culp, I think I already
gave Michael an A-minus.

45
00:05:25.808 --> 00:05:27.276
He told me. Thank you.

46
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:28.819
Mr. Langdon?

47
00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:30.821
Hi.

48
00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:32.318
Bonjour, Professor.

49
00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:38.326
I'm Lieutenant Collet from
DCPJ. A kind of French FBI.

50
00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:41.662
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

51
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:44.745
My police chief, Captain
Fache, had hoped,

52
00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:48.252
considering your expertise
and the markings on the body,

53
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.832
you might assist us.

54
00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.601
Will you excuse me a moment?

55
00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:06.106
I was supposed to have drinks
with him earlier this evening.

56
00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:07.354
Yes, we know.

57
00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:10.857
We found your name in his daily planner.

58
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.774
He never showed. I
waited for over an hour.

59
00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:20.701
Why would someone do this to him?

60
00:06:20.863 --> 00:06:23.457
Oh, you misunderstand, Professor.

61
00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:26.619
He was shot, yes.

62
00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:29.455
But what you see in the photograph,

63
00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:32.007
Monsieur Saunière did to himself.

64
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:39.557
Teacher, all four are dead.

65
00:06:40.382 --> 00:06:43.477
The sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

66
00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:46.731
Then I assume you have the location.

67
00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.018
Confirmed by all.

68
00:06:50.184 --> 00:06:52.607
Independently.

69
00:06:53.395 --> 00:06:57.741
I had feared the Priory's
penchant for secrecy might prevail.

70
00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:05.367
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

71
00:07:08.702 --> 00:07:09.703
He guessed.

72
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.087
It is here.

73
00:07:11.455 --> 00:07:13.924
In Paris, Teacher.

74
00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:20.307
It hides beneath the
Rose in Saint-Sulpice.

75
00:07:20.798 --> 00:07:23.142
You will go forth, Silas.

76
00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:40.002
I chastise my body.

77
00:09:17.748 --> 00:09:19.876
Captain Fache is waiting for you.

78
00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:29.514
Okay.

79
00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:42.235
-Mr. Langdon.
-Yes.

80
00:09:42.773 --> 00:09:44.696
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

81
00:09:45.734 --> 00:09:47.236
You like our pyramid?

82
00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:48.411
It's magnificent.

83
00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:51.115
A scar on the face of Paris.

84
00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:54.080
After me, please.

85
00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:01.713
Ah.

86
00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:03.920
It's the pairing of those two pyramids.

87
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.842
It's unique.

88
00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:08.094
The two are geometric echoes.

89
00:10:08.257 --> 00:10:09.258
Fascinating.

90
00:10:11.969 --> 00:10:15.519
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

91
00:10:16.223 --> 00:10:18.851
How well did you know the curator?

92
00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:20.231
Not very well.

93
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.905
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

94
00:10:31.947 --> 00:10:34.325
Could we take the stairs?

95
00:10:48.922 --> 00:10:52.301
So Saunière requested tonight's meeting.

96
00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:53.510
Yes.

97
00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:55.187
How? Did he call you?

98
00:10:56.847 --> 00:11:00.101
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

99
00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:04.363
- Had something to discuss.
- What?

100
00:11:09.318 --> 00:11:12.117
You seem uncomfortable.

101
00:11:23.082 --> 00:11:27.963
Ah, the Grande Galerie. This
is where you found the body.

102
00:11:28.045 --> 00:11:29.843
How would you know that?

103
00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:33.934
I recognize the parquet
floor from the Polaroid.

104
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:35.556
It's unmistakable.

105
00:11:44.895 --> 00:11:46.192
Dear God.

106
00:11:50.192 --> 00:11:52.570
Let's cover the talking
points again, Your Eminence.

107
00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:55.748
Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult.

108
00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:58.583
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

109
00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:01.128
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

110
00:12:01.203 --> 00:12:03.626
Perhaps a less defensive
tack, Your Eminence.

111
00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:05.833
The press continue to be harsh with us.

112
00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.593
We are not, um, Cafeteria Catholics.

113
00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:14.220
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

114
00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:16.927
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

115
00:12:17.719 --> 00:12:21.815
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing,

116
00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:25.019
and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

117
00:12:25.394 --> 00:12:29.524
Many of our followers are
married. Many of them have families.

118
00:12:29.731 --> 00:12:31.233
Only a small proportion

119
00:12:31.316 --> 00:12:32.693
choose to live ascetic lives.

120
00:12:32.776 --> 00:12:35.746
- Why are some media...
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

121
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.497
Aringarosa.

122
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.415
Silas has succeeded. The legend is true.

123
00:12:42.744 --> 00:12:44.621
It hides beneath the Rose.

124
00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:47.962
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

125
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.595
I meet the council in an hour.

126
00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:55.592
I will have your money tonight, Teacher.

127
00:12:55.924 --> 00:12:58.393
The Vitruvian Man.

128
00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:01.096
It's one of Leonardo da
Vinci's most famous sketches.

129
00:13:01.805 --> 00:13:03.773
And the star on his skin?

130
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.944
- A pentacle.
- And its meaning?

131
00:13:07.352 --> 00:13:09.446
The pentacle is a pagan religious icon.

132
00:13:10.022 --> 00:13:11.695
Devil worship.

133
00:13:11.773 --> 00:13:16.119
No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that.

134
00:13:16.945 --> 00:13:19.323
This is a symbol for Venus.

135
00:13:20.073 --> 00:13:22.417
It represents the
female half of all things.

136
00:13:22.492 --> 00:13:25.462
You are telling me that
Saunière's last act on earth

137
00:13:25.537 --> 00:13:29.633
was to draw a goddess
symbol on his chest? Why?

138
00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:34.338
Captain Fache, obviously
I can't tell you why.

139
00:13:35.255 --> 00:13:39.510
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol,

140
00:13:39.593 --> 00:13:41.891
and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

141
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.472
- Is that so?
- Yes.

142
00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:47.776
Then what do you make of this?

143
00:13:48.352 --> 00:13:52.323
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint."

144
00:13:52.814 --> 00:13:55.658
It's a phrase. Doesn't
mean anything, not to me.

145
00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:59.913
What would you do if you had
such limited time to send a message?

146
00:14:01.365 --> 00:14:05.962
Well, I suppose I'd
try to identify my killer.

147
00:14:06.828 --> 00:14:07.954
Precisely.

148
00:14:08.664 --> 00:14:10.166
Precisely.

149
00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:11.424
So, Professor...

150
00:14:13.043 --> 00:14:15.137
Officer Neveu.

151
00:14:15.212 --> 00:14:16.839
Please, pardon the interruption.

152
00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:17.923
This is not the time.

153
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.343
I received the crime-scene
jpegs at headquarters...

154
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:22.352
...and I've deciphered the code.

155
00:14:22.678 --> 00:14:24.271
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

156
00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:25.897
That's the code
Saunière left on the floor.

157
00:14:26.014 --> 00:14:26.981
Fibonacci?

158
00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:29.276
Headquarters sent me to explain, captain.

159
00:14:29.393 --> 00:14:30.861
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

160
00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.279
The numbers are out of order.

161
00:14:32.354 --> 00:14:35.358
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

162
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.441
Right?

163
00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:38.319
Hmm? Pardon me?

164
00:14:40.696 --> 00:14:43.825
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

165
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.951
Your embassy called Division.

166
00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:50.372
Um...

167
00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:55.044
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

168
00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.931
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

169
00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.342
Well, thank you.

170
00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.897
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

171
00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:14.981
Miss Neveu? This...

172
00:15:15.063 --> 00:15:16.315
No. That's the right number.

173
00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.821
You have to dial an access
code to pick up your messages.

174
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.992
But I'm getting...

175
00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:22.947
It's a three-digit code. It's
on the paper I gave you.

176
00:15:32.164 --> 00:15:35.338
Professor Langdon, do
not react to this message.

177
00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:38.011
You must follow my
directions very closely

178
00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:41.306
and, above all, reveal
nothing to Captain Fache.

179
00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:43.429
You are in grave danger.

180
00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:58.402
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

181
00:15:58.607 --> 00:16:00.280
Good evening, Sister.

182
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:05.076
I need you to show
someone our church tonight.

183
00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:06.915
Of course, Father.

184
00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:09.122
But so late?

185
00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.370
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

186
00:16:11.536 --> 00:16:16.292
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

187
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.469
It would be my pleasure.

188
00:16:43.318 --> 00:16:46.492
There's been an accident. A friend.

189
00:16:46.571 --> 00:16:50.041
-I have to fly home in the morning.
-I see.

190
00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.085
Is there a restroom I could use?

191
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.413
I just wanna splash
some water on my face.

192
00:16:54.496 --> 00:16:55.668
Yes.

193
00:16:57.791 --> 00:17:00.590
She said it is meaningless.

194
00:17:01.378 --> 00:17:03.176
A mathematical joke.

195
00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:06.015
Is it meaningless?

196
00:17:08.677 --> 00:17:10.771
I'll take another look when I come back.

197
00:17:14.641 --> 00:17:17.064
I'm sorry. Of course.

198
00:17:31.032 --> 00:17:33.251
Do you have a message from Saunière?

199
00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:35.579
What are you talking about?

200
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:37.999
Crazy old man.

201
00:17:38.373 --> 00:17:40.967
You have me confused with someone else.

202
00:17:41.168 --> 00:17:43.170
- I came here to...
- Check your jacket pocket.

203
00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:45.760
Just look.

204
00:17:49.843 --> 00:17:51.561
GPS tracking dot.

205
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.894
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

206
00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:58.022
The agent who picked you
up slipped it into your jacket

207
00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:02.072
in case you tried to run.

208
00:18:03.607 --> 00:18:06.235
We have you on a little leash, Professor.

209
00:18:06.568 --> 00:18:08.570
Why would I try to
run? I didn't do anything.

210
00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:12.825
So, what do you think
about the fourth line of text

211
00:18:12.908 --> 00:18:15.787
Fache wiped clean before you arrived?

212
00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:25.505
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

213
00:18:29.174 --> 00:18:31.927
He's still in there? What's he doing?

214
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.514
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

215
00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:37.099
He is sure you're guilty.

216
00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:43.321
When did Saunière contact you?

217
00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:44.865
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

218
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.942
What time? What time?

219
00:18:47.025 --> 00:18:49.244
Uh, at 3:00. Around 3:00. 3:00.

220
00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:53.119
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

221
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.540
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

222
00:18:56.618 --> 00:19:00.043
And by then whatever Saunière
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

223
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:02.465
Lady, stop it! Just stop!

224
00:19:02.874 --> 00:19:04.376
Who are you?

225
00:19:09.297 --> 00:19:11.140
Look at the letters.

226
00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:13.852
"P.S."

227
00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:15.934
P.S., postscript.

228
00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:20.149
"Princess Sophie." Silly, I know.

229
00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:22.978
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

230
00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.947
Jacques Saunière was my grandfather.

231
00:19:34.114 --> 00:19:37.459
Apparently, it was his
dying wish that we meet.

232
00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.588
If you help me understand why

233
00:19:41.663 --> 00:19:45.338
I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

234
00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:49.338
Fache was never gonna let
me just stroll out of here, was he?

235
00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.343
No.

236
00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:56.057
If we are to get away from
here, we must find another way.

237
00:20:04.853 --> 00:20:07.151
What exactly do you propose?

238
00:20:16.698 --> 00:20:19.542
Saunière was reading his book.

239
00:20:19.951 --> 00:20:21.919
"Blood trail."

240
00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:25.756
Excuse me, captain.

241
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:28.009
We have a problem.

242
00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:31.213
Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu.

243
00:20:33.423 --> 00:20:34.640
What?

244
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:38.224
Captain, look at this.

245
00:20:39.804 --> 00:20:41.056
He jumped!

246
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.732
Shit.

247
00:20:44.893 --> 00:20:48.067
He's moving again. And fast.

248
00:20:48.772 --> 00:20:50.570
He must be in a car.

249
00:20:51.983 --> 00:20:56.204
He's going south on Pont du Carrousel.

250
00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:06.210
Bastard.

251
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:32.490
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

252
00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:38.742
I will only take a moment.

253
00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:40.491
Of course.

254
00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:51.380
He is much older than I remember.

255
00:22:03.138 --> 00:22:06.517
I hadn't seen or spoken
to him in a very long time.

256
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:19.621
He phoned my office today. Several times.

257
00:22:20.822 --> 00:22:23.826
He said it was a
matter of life and death.

258
00:22:24.325 --> 00:22:27.670
I thought it was another
trick to get back in touch.

259
00:22:30.331 --> 00:22:33.130
It seems when he couldn't speak to me,

260
00:22:34.377 --> 00:22:36.379
he reached out to you.

261
00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:55.816
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

262
00:22:57.525 --> 00:23:00.779
This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong.

263
00:23:02.447 --> 00:23:06.042
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

264
00:23:06.117 --> 00:23:07.664
These are scrambled.

265
00:23:07.744 --> 00:23:11.499
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

266
00:23:11.581 --> 00:23:13.458
Would you hold this, please?

267
00:23:16.002 --> 00:23:17.879
This phrase is meaningless.

268
00:23:19.923 --> 00:23:24.520
Unless you assume these
letters are out of order too.

269
00:23:24.594 --> 00:23:25.766
An anagram.

270
00:23:37.524 --> 00:23:39.322
You have eidetic memory?

271
00:23:39.609 --> 00:23:43.159
Not quite. But I can pretty
much remember what I see.

272
00:24:00.129 --> 00:24:01.130
Whoa.

273
00:24:04.551 --> 00:24:06.474
Anagram is right.

274
00:24:07.887 --> 00:24:10.436
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint" becomes

275
00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:13.143
"Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa."

276
00:24:13.476 --> 00:24:17.151
Professor, the Mona
Lisa is right over here.

277
00:24:23.653 --> 00:24:28.625
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

278
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.577
Smart to hit the truck.

279
00:24:30.952 --> 00:24:34.502
What, you admire him now?

280
00:24:36.124 --> 00:24:38.218
We're stupid. Who did
we leave at the museum?

281
00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:41.129
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

282
00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:44.428
Her smile is in the
lower spatial frequencies.

283
00:24:44.507 --> 00:24:48.307
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

284
00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:49.512
Why?

285
00:24:49.596 --> 00:24:53.100
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

286
00:24:53.182 --> 00:24:56.356
Historically, the left was
female, the right was male.

287
00:24:56.436 --> 00:24:58.154
There. Blood.

288
00:25:06.613 --> 00:25:07.739
Hey.

289
00:25:09.407 --> 00:25:12.035
"So dark the con of man."

290
00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:16.172
No. It doesn't say that.

291
00:25:16.331 --> 00:25:18.675
Is it another anagram? Can you break it?

292
00:25:23.588 --> 00:25:26.057
- Professor, hurry. Hurry!
- Uh...

293
00:25:27.717 --> 00:25:30.687
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

294
00:25:30.887 --> 00:25:34.858
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

295
00:25:34.933 --> 00:25:36.185
Madonna of the Rocks.

296
00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:38.027
Da Vinci.

297
00:25:48.404 --> 00:25:50.156
Careful. Careful.

298
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.460
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

299
00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.963
It was Saunière's.

300
00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:46.554
I remember finding it
once when I was a girl.

301
00:26:47.422 --> 00:26:49.641
He'd promised he'd give it to me one day.

302
00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:52.769
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

303
00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:54.346
"So dark the con of man"?

304
00:26:54.429 --> 00:26:56.056
No. Have you?

305
00:26:56.139 --> 00:26:59.769
When you were a child, were
you aware of any secret gatherings?

306
00:27:00.893 --> 00:27:03.271
Anything ritualistic in nature?

307
00:27:03.438 --> 00:27:06.692
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

308
00:27:06.899 --> 00:27:10.403
Was there ever any talk of
something called the Priory of Sion?

309
00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:13.452
The what? Why are
you asking these things?

310
00:27:13.656 --> 00:27:16.705
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

311
00:27:16.784 --> 00:27:19.037
One of the world's oldest
and most secret societies,

312
00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:23.626
with leaders like Sir Isaac
Newton, da Vinci himself.

313
00:27:23.958 --> 00:27:25.801
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

314
00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:28.596
They're guardians of a
secret they supposedly refer to

315
00:27:28.671 --> 00:27:30.924
as "the dark con of man."

316
00:27:31.466 --> 00:27:32.888
But what secret?

317
00:27:33.426 --> 00:27:38.728
The Priory of Sion protects the
source of God's power on Earth.

318
00:27:47.648 --> 00:27:49.525
I can't do this by myself.

319
00:27:50.068 --> 00:27:53.117
I'm in enough trouble as
it is. That's my embassy.

320
00:27:53.196 --> 00:27:54.288
Please.

321
00:27:54.363 --> 00:27:56.832
- Even if we could get out of this...
- Okay.

322
00:28:33.945 --> 00:28:37.324
No, no, no. You're not gonna
make it. You're not gonna make it!

323
00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:46.299
Well, that was...

324
00:28:55.174 --> 00:28:56.926
We need to get out of sight.

325
00:29:11.566 --> 00:29:13.864
Christ, give me strength.

326
00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:26.164
Aah!

327
00:29:26.414 --> 00:29:29.042
You are a ghost.

328
00:29:31.752 --> 00:29:34.050
Christ, give me strength.

329
00:30:11.334 --> 00:30:13.962
Stealing in a house of God!

330
00:30:27.308 --> 00:30:29.310
You are an angel.

331
00:30:31.562 --> 00:30:33.815
Christ, give me strength.

332
00:30:59.298 --> 00:31:01.471
You have powerful friends.

333
00:31:02.176 --> 00:31:05.350
Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me.

334
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.935
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

335
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.279
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

336
00:31:13.354 --> 00:31:15.356
The light is not ideal.

337
00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:20.445
Tell me, Sister,
please, of the Rose Line.

338
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:26.038
A rose line is any line that goes
from the North to South Poles.

339
00:31:26.158 --> 00:31:31.039
Set into the streets of
Paris, 135 brass markers

340
00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:34.001
mark the world's first prime meridian

341
00:31:34.083 --> 00:31:36.506
which passed through this very church.

342
00:31:36.585 --> 00:31:38.428
It hides beneath the Rose.

343
00:31:38.587 --> 00:31:39.804
I'm sorry?

344
00:31:41.215 --> 00:31:42.467
Sister.

345
00:31:45.177 --> 00:31:48.477
I do not want to keep
you. I will show myself out.

346
00:31:51.684 --> 00:31:52.810
I insist.

347
00:31:57.064 --> 00:31:59.988
May the peace of the Lord be with you.

348
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:03.032
And with you.

349
00:32:16.584 --> 00:32:21.761
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

350
00:32:22.506 --> 00:32:27.433
And two tickets to Brussels
paid for with Langdon's credit card.

351
00:32:27.636 --> 00:32:29.104
A decoy, I'm sure.

352
00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:31.774
All the same, send
an officer to the station.

353
00:32:31.974 --> 00:32:34.602
Question all the taxi
drivers. I'll put this on the wire.

354
00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:37.651
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

355
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.780
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

356
00:32:41.942 --> 00:32:44.912
Robert Langdon is guilty.

357
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.123
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

358
00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:58.050
We should be safe in
this park for a few minutes.

359
00:33:42.878 --> 00:33:43.879
No!

360
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.307
Stay here.

361
00:33:53.013 --> 00:33:54.356
Police.

362
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.193
What do you want?

363
00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:04.825
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

364
00:34:07.027 --> 00:34:09.200
Go and get something to eat.

365
00:34:29.175 --> 00:34:31.052
Did it ever occur to you
that could be dangerous?

366
00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:34.355
No. And now we have a place to think.

367
00:34:35.097 --> 00:34:36.815
Any ideas, Professor?

368
00:34:38.017 --> 00:34:41.567
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

369
00:34:43.689 --> 00:34:45.737
"What's the next step?"

370
00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:47.902
With him, it's always,

371
00:34:47.985 --> 00:34:51.080
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

372
00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.332
Puzzles.

373
00:34:53.407 --> 00:34:54.750
Codes.

374
00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.831
A treasure hunt.

375
00:35:01.415 --> 00:35:02.667
To find his killer.

376
00:35:06.921 --> 00:35:10.346
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

377
00:35:10.549 --> 00:35:11.550
I hope not.

378
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:16.601
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

379
00:35:16.972 --> 00:35:20.146
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king

380
00:35:20.226 --> 00:35:22.649
conquered the holy city of Jerusalem.

381
00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:26.403
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history,

382
00:35:26.482 --> 00:35:30.112
was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood,

383
00:35:30.194 --> 00:35:31.366
the Priory of Sion

384
00:35:31.445 --> 00:35:35.746
and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

385
00:35:36.283 --> 00:35:39.332
But the Templars were
created to protect the Holy Land.

386
00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:43.542
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

387
00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:47.094
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact

388
00:35:47.169 --> 00:35:49.092
lost since the time of Christ.

389
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:53.301
An artifact, it was said, the
Church would kill to possess.

390
00:35:53.801 --> 00:35:56.395
Did they find it, this buried treasure?

391
00:35:57.596 --> 00:35:58.848
Put it this way.

392
00:35:58.973 --> 00:36:01.396
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

393
00:36:02.142 --> 00:36:05.316
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

394
00:36:05.813 --> 00:36:07.815
Whether they blackmailed the papacy

395
00:36:07.898 --> 00:36:10.242
or the Church bought
their silence, no one knows.

396
00:36:10.317 --> 00:36:14.493
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights,

397
00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:18.202
these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

398
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.664
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

399
00:36:22.746 --> 00:36:24.168
Too threatening.

400
00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:26.588
So the Vatican issued secret orders

401
00:36:27.001 --> 00:36:29.800
to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

402
00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:34.426
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers

403
00:36:34.508 --> 00:36:38.729
and said God had charged him with
cleansing the Earth of these heretics.

404
00:36:39.221 --> 00:36:41.565
The plan went off like clockwork.

405
00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.894
The Templars were all but exterminated.

406
00:36:44.977 --> 00:36:49.198
The date was October 13, 1307. A Friday.

407
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.158
Friday the 13th.

408
00:36:52.026 --> 00:36:55.030
The Pope sent troops to
claim the Priory's treasure,

409
00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:56.705
but they found nothing.

410
00:36:56.864 --> 00:37:00.334
The few surviving Knights
of the Priory had vanished,

411
00:37:00.409 --> 00:37:03.458
and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

412
00:37:03.537 --> 00:37:06.916
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

413
00:37:07.875 --> 00:37:09.377
Yes, you have.

414
00:37:09.752 --> 00:37:11.504
Almost everyone on Earth has.

415
00:37:12.504 --> 00:37:15.132
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

416
00:37:21.263 --> 00:37:24.733
Please, Saunière thought he
knew the location of the Holy Grail?

417
00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:27.732
Maybe more than that.

418
00:37:27.895 --> 00:37:31.775
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

419
00:37:31.857 --> 00:37:36.408
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

420
00:37:37.237 --> 00:37:38.659
"Haxo 24."

421
00:37:41.283 --> 00:37:44.662
And these dots. These
dots are read by a laser.

422
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.591
This is more than a pendant. This
is a key your grandfather left you.

423
00:37:48.749 --> 00:37:50.922
He left us, Professor.

424
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:57.057
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

425
00:37:57.549 --> 00:37:59.426
It's a street address.

426
00:38:04.348 --> 00:38:05.941
This is Jacques Saunière.

427
00:38:06.308 --> 00:38:08.686
Please leave a message after the tone.

428
00:38:09.853 --> 00:38:12.231
Please, Monsieur
Saunière, pick up the phone.

429
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:13.983
This is Sandrine Bieil.

430
00:38:14.233 --> 00:38:16.486
I have called the list.

431
00:38:16.902 --> 00:38:18.825
I fear the other guardians are dead.

432
00:38:19.405 --> 00:38:21.328
The lie has been told.

433
00:38:21.657 --> 00:38:23.580
The floor panel has been broken.

434
00:38:24.243 --> 00:38:27.668
Please, monsieur, pick
up the phone. I beg you.

435
00:38:27.746 --> 00:38:29.464
Job 38, verse 11.

436
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.173
Do you know it, Sister?

437
00:38:34.962 --> 00:38:36.714
Job 38:11.

438
00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:42.637
"Hitherto shalt thou
come but no further."

439
00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:44.809
"But no further."

440
00:38:48.934 --> 00:38:50.811
Do you mock me?

441
00:38:53.689 --> 00:38:55.817
Where is the keystone?

442
00:38:56.817 --> 00:38:58.569
I do not know.

443
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:00.737
No.

444
00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:05.409
You are a sister of the Church

445
00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:11.249
and yet you serve them, the Priory.

446
00:39:11.331 --> 00:39:15.256
Jesus had but one true message, that...

447
00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.984
Come, you saints of God.

448
00:39:31.894 --> 00:39:34.522
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

449
00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:38.025
To receive her soul.

450
00:39:38.484 --> 00:39:43.035
And bring her to the
sight of the Almighty.

451
00:40:01.548 --> 00:40:03.221
Welcome, Bishop.

452
00:40:04.092 --> 00:40:06.140
This council is convened.

453
00:40:14.728 --> 00:40:18.153
Our words shall never pass these walls.

454
00:40:21.235 --> 00:40:22.908
What business, say you?

455
00:40:24.863 --> 00:40:26.991
As you know, my request for funds...

456
00:40:27.074 --> 00:40:30.920
Yes, 20 million euro in
untraceable bearer bonds.

457
00:40:31.578 --> 00:40:34.878
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldn't you say, Bishop?

458
00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:41.298
I only offer a route to the
renewal of faith for all men.

459
00:40:41.421 --> 00:40:42.843
How humble.

460
00:40:42.923 --> 00:40:45.722
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

461
00:40:45.801 --> 00:40:47.348
How dare you presume to...

462
00:40:47.427 --> 00:40:49.145
I do not presume, I act!

463
00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:53.518
The Vatican's unwillingness to
support us is both impious and cowardly.

464
00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:57.939
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

465
00:40:58.605 --> 00:41:01.825
This council has
forgotten its very purpose.

466
00:41:04.528 --> 00:41:09.375
Tonight, the Grail will be destroyed.

467
00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:12.999
The Priory's few remaining
members will be silenced.

468
00:41:21.211 --> 00:41:25.466
I was contacted by a man who
calls himself only "the Teacher."

469
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.604
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

470
00:41:30.762 --> 00:41:32.981
...getting into a taxi in
the Bois de Boulogne.

471
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.823
Because of your expertise?

472
00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:47.579
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

473
00:41:47.654 --> 00:41:50.123
Do you think that's why
Saunière sought you out?

474
00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:53.919
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

475
00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:58.090
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

476
00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:02.299
Once made a joke at my
expense. Got a big laugh out of it.

477
00:42:02.377 --> 00:42:03.720
What was it?

478
00:42:16.892 --> 00:42:18.690
How may I help you?

479
00:42:24.566 --> 00:42:26.864
The door to the right, please.

480
00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:48.011
Good evening. I am André
Vernet, the night manager.

481
00:42:49.508 --> 00:42:52.762
I take it this is your first
visit to our establishment?

482
00:42:53.553 --> 00:42:54.679
Yes.

483
00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:56.732
Understood.

484
00:42:57.557 --> 00:42:58.979
Keys are often passed on

485
00:42:59.059 --> 00:43:02.780
and first-time users are
sometimes uncertain of protocol.

486
00:43:04.564 --> 00:43:07.408
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

487
00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:11.535
Often willed through generations.

488
00:43:14.449 --> 00:43:16.918
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

489
00:43:19.037 --> 00:43:22.041
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

490
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:25.089
And what's your longest account?

491
00:43:25.293 --> 00:43:26.886
Quite a bit longer.

492
00:43:27.337 --> 00:43:29.965
Technologies change, keys are updated.

493
00:43:35.387 --> 00:43:37.139
Once the computer confirms your key,

494
00:43:37.222 --> 00:43:40.271
enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

495
00:43:40.976 --> 00:43:43.445
The room is yours, as long as you like.

496
00:43:48.442 --> 00:43:51.662
What if I lost track of
my account number?

497
00:43:52.237 --> 00:43:53.705
How might I recover it?

498
00:43:55.949 --> 00:43:58.668
I'm afraid each key is
paired with a 10-digit number

499
00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:00.872
known only to the account bearer.

500
00:44:00.954 --> 00:44:03.048
I hope you manage to remember it.

501
00:44:03.665 --> 00:44:06.293
A single wrong entry disables the system.

502
00:44:13.258 --> 00:44:14.475
- Ten.
- Ten.

503
00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.100
Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence.

504
00:44:20.182 --> 00:44:22.560
Scrambled, unscrambled?

505
00:44:23.477 --> 00:44:24.820
Unscrambled.

506
00:44:25.479 --> 00:44:27.152
It's your key.

507
00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.581
Funny, I don't even like history.

508
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.206
I've never seen much good
come from looking to the past.

509
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.172
Moment of truth.

510
00:45:36.842 --> 00:45:39.391
My God. I don't believe this.

511
00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:40.975
A rose.

512
00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.652
The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail.

513
00:45:50.522 --> 00:45:52.490
Forgive the intrusion.

514
00:45:52.566 --> 00:45:55.695
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than anticipated.

515
00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.572
You must follow me, please.

516
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.157
For your own safety.

517
00:46:00.532 --> 00:46:02.250
You knew they were coming?

518
00:46:02.325 --> 00:46:05.169
My guard alerted me to
your status when you arrived.

519
00:46:05.245 --> 00:46:08.249
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

520
00:46:08.331 --> 00:46:10.584
It includes a safe-passage clause.

521
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:11.922
Safe passage?

522
00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:16.090
If you would step inside,
please. Time is of the essence.

523
00:46:19.217 --> 00:46:20.469
In there?

524
00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.448
Hey, is there a problem?

525
00:46:37.694 --> 00:46:40.322
Good evening, sir. Police.

526
00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:44.876
I just drive from here to
Zurich. Not French, English?

527
00:46:45.118 --> 00:46:46.244
- English?
- Yes.

528
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:50.295
We are looking for two criminals.

529
00:46:51.583 --> 00:46:54.462
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

530
00:46:56.254 --> 00:46:58.598
Would you mind opening the hold?

531
00:46:59.132 --> 00:47:02.762
Please. You think they
trust us, the wages I get paid?

532
00:47:02.844 --> 00:47:04.846
You don't have keys to your own truck?

533
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.649
It's armored. Keys get
sent to the destination.

534
00:47:07.807 --> 00:47:09.901
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

535
00:47:13.438 --> 00:47:17.818
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

536
00:47:18.318 --> 00:47:19.410
What?

537
00:47:21.821 --> 00:47:23.494
This piece of shit.

538
00:47:23.573 --> 00:47:25.450
Forty euros in Barbés.

539
00:47:25.533 --> 00:47:26.659
Yours for 35.

540
00:47:27.035 --> 00:47:28.412
No, no, no.

541
00:47:28.495 --> 00:47:30.338
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

542
00:47:30.455 --> 00:47:33.208
- Come on, 30?
- I said, no!

543
00:47:33.792 --> 00:47:34.918
Move along!

544
00:47:48.348 --> 00:47:49.565
Now we wait.

545
00:47:49.641 --> 00:47:52.360
The Teacher will call and tell
me where to deliver the money.

546
00:47:52.435 --> 00:47:55.780
You have put tremendous
faith in this Teacher of yours.

547
00:47:55.855 --> 00:48:00.281
Yes, I have. And I have given
him an angel to do his will.

548
00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:04.156
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

549
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.960
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

550
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.961
...to do penance and to amend my life.

551
00:48:14.249 --> 00:48:15.250
Amen.

552
00:48:30.598 --> 00:48:32.225
The Holy Grail.

553
00:48:33.018 --> 00:48:37.990
A magic cup. The source
of God's power on earth.

554
00:48:38.064 --> 00:48:39.361
It's nonsense.

555
00:48:40.317 --> 00:48:42.240
You don't believe in God.

556
00:48:43.111 --> 00:48:44.237
No.

557
00:48:45.196 --> 00:48:46.698
Just people.

558
00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:50.585
Um, sometimes that they can be kind.

559
00:48:51.953 --> 00:48:54.547
Are you a God-fearing man, Professor?

560
00:48:56.082 --> 00:48:57.925
I was raised a Catholic.

561
00:48:58.585 --> 00:49:01.008
Well, that's not really an answer.

562
00:49:03.048 --> 00:49:04.766
Professor, are you okay?

563
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.427
Ah, go ahead, open it.

564
00:49:08.261 --> 00:49:09.308
Go on.

565
00:49:16.436 --> 00:49:17.779
A cryptex.

566
00:49:19.064 --> 00:49:21.567
They are used to keep secrets.

567
00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.487
It's da Vinci's design.

568
00:49:25.236 --> 00:49:28.661
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll

569
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:33.837
which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

570
00:49:33.912 --> 00:49:37.212
If you force it open, the vial breaks,

571
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.964
vinegar dissolves papyrus,

572
00:49:41.878 --> 00:49:44.472
and your secret is lost forever.

573
00:49:44.839 --> 00:49:47.012
The only way to access the information

574
00:49:47.092 --> 00:49:52.724
is to spell out the password with
these five dials, each with 26 letters.

575
00:49:53.765 --> 00:49:57.645
That's 12 million possibilities.

576
00:49:58.395 --> 00:50:01.899
I've never met a girl who
knew that much about a cryptex.

577
00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.486
Saunière made one for me once.

578
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:16.671
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

579
00:50:19.207 --> 00:50:21.505
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

580
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.552
Come on.

581
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.308
Please, you're not all right.

582
00:50:31.678 --> 00:50:33.146
May I try something?

583
00:50:33.805 --> 00:50:35.398
I don't know why it works.

584
00:50:36.307 --> 00:50:39.356
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

585
00:50:40.228 --> 00:50:41.525
You think?

586
00:50:42.313 --> 00:50:43.405
Yes.

587
00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:57.162
Feeling better, Sophie?

588
00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:13.561
My parents died in a
car crash with my brother.

589
00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:16.064
I was four.

590
00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:19.434
I'm sorry.

591
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:22.733
It was many years ago.

592
00:51:38.411 --> 00:51:39.663
Better?

593
00:51:42.415 --> 00:51:43.416
Yeah.

594
00:51:44.209 --> 00:51:45.335
Okay.

595
00:52:11.444 --> 00:52:14.038
Twenty years waiting for
someone to come for that box,

596
00:52:14.113 --> 00:52:16.662
and now it's you two
murderers. Bring it to me.

597
00:52:17.617 --> 00:52:19.290
I don't know what you're talking about.

598
00:52:20.495 --> 00:52:22.293
All right! Okay!

599
00:52:23.122 --> 00:52:24.123
Right now!

600
00:52:34.592 --> 00:52:35.593
Step back!

601
00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.979
No one will lose sleep over
a couple on a killing spree.

602
00:52:45.144 --> 00:52:46.191
Turn around.

603
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.902
Turn around!

604
00:52:49.482 --> 00:52:51.155
You too, mademoiselle.

605
00:53:13.923 --> 00:53:15.095
Sophie!

606
00:53:15.883 --> 00:53:17.260
Get in the truck!

607
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.353
I'll drive! Hurry!

608
00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:52.720
What happened between you
and your grandfather, exactly?

609
00:53:54.339 --> 00:53:58.094
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

610
00:53:58.217 --> 00:53:59.810
I need to know.

611
00:54:00.053 --> 00:54:03.808
You say he raised you, but
you two don't talk anymore.

612
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:05.688
You call him by his last name.

613
00:54:06.267 --> 00:54:08.486
You say you hate history.

614
00:54:08.561 --> 00:54:10.984
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

615
00:54:11.064 --> 00:54:13.066
So now you're a psychologist too?

616
00:54:13.524 --> 00:54:18.121
What if Saunière had started
to groom you for the Priory?

617
00:54:18.196 --> 00:54:19.664
What do you mean, groom me?

618
00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:22.993
Your grandfather gave you
puzzles and cryptex as a child.

619
00:54:23.076 --> 00:54:27.081
So you are saying all this is
real? The Priory, the Holy Grail?

620
00:54:27.288 --> 00:54:30.542
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

621
00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:32.753
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

622
00:54:38.966 --> 00:54:41.515
I'm out of my field here.

623
00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:49.232
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

624
00:54:49.894 --> 00:54:52.192
An Englishman, lives here in France.

625
00:54:52.271 --> 00:54:53.898
Do you trust this man?

626
00:54:55.024 --> 00:54:56.571
I hope you can.

627
00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:09.004
It seems you're not a driver at all.

628
00:55:10.832 --> 00:55:15.633
Apparently, you lost your
tongue along with your truck.

629
00:55:16.295 --> 00:55:18.969
You think you're in
pain now, André Vernet?

630
00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:23.387
My cause is worth your life. Understand?

631
00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.317
What do you want?

632
00:55:29.642 --> 00:55:34.899
Your truck carries a
homing device. Activate it.

633
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:45.249
Please wait. I'll see if he's available.

634
00:55:45.366 --> 00:55:47.243
It's on the wrong side.

635
00:55:47.326 --> 00:55:49.954
Leigh likes all things to be
English, including his cars.

636
00:55:50.037 --> 00:55:53.166
Robert! Do I owe you money?

637
00:55:53.916 --> 00:55:56.920
Leigh, my friend,

638
00:55:57.003 --> 00:56:00.098
care to open up for an old colleague?

639
00:56:00.173 --> 00:56:01.891
- Of course.
- Thank you.

640
00:56:02.717 --> 00:56:05.140
But first, a test of honor.

641
00:56:05.511 --> 00:56:07.229
Three questions.

642
00:56:10.516 --> 00:56:11.859
Fire away.

643
00:56:11.934 --> 00:56:13.356
Your first.

644
00:56:13.561 --> 00:56:16.235
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

645
00:56:17.106 --> 00:56:18.608
Tea, of course.

646
00:56:18.691 --> 00:56:19.863
Excellent.

647
00:56:19.942 --> 00:56:22.240
Second. Milk or lemon?

648
00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.326
Milk?

649
00:56:25.698 --> 00:56:28.121
That would depend on the tea.

650
00:56:28.201 --> 00:56:29.293
Correct.

651
00:56:30.203 --> 00:56:34.379
And now the third and
most grave of inquiries.

652
00:56:34.499 --> 00:56:40.006
In which year did a Harvard sculler
out-row an Oxford man at Henley?

653
00:56:47.428 --> 00:56:51.183
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

654
00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.685
Your heart is true.

655
00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:55.903
You may pass.

656
00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:00.074
Welcome to Château Villette.

657
00:57:02.985 --> 00:57:05.613
The truck's signal is coming online.

658
00:57:05.822 --> 00:57:07.244
It's about time.

659
00:57:10.993 --> 00:57:12.620
Locked on and tracking, sir.

660
00:57:15.456 --> 00:57:18.881
Very good. Tell Collet not
to move in until I get there.

661
00:57:19.418 --> 00:57:23.924
Attention! All of Collet's
units to Château Villette.

662
00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:28.186
The suspects Neveu and
Langdon are likely at that location.

663
00:57:44.485 --> 00:57:45.828
Aringarosa.

664
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:59.793
I still don't know why
he put you into this

665
00:58:00.501 --> 00:58:02.424
and I'm sorry.

666
00:58:07.508 --> 00:58:11.354
But I'm also very glad.

667
00:58:29.614 --> 00:58:32.288
You are requested to
make yourself at home.

668
00:58:40.583 --> 00:58:41.755
Robert!

669
00:58:42.835 --> 00:58:45.429
And you travel with a maiden, it seems.

670
00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:48.975
Sir Leigh Teabing, may I
present Miss Sophie Neveu.

671
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:51.178
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

672
00:58:51.552 --> 00:58:55.398
It's an honor to welcome you...

673
00:58:56.015 --> 00:58:58.109
...even though it's late.

674
00:58:58.184 --> 00:59:02.030
Thank you for having
us. I realize it's quite late.

675
00:59:03.314 --> 00:59:06.318
So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early.

676
00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:10.572
What a lovely smile you have.

677
00:59:12.907 --> 00:59:13.908
Earl Grey?

678
00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:15.709
Lemon.

679
00:59:16.410 --> 00:59:17.536
Correct.

680
00:59:38.432 --> 00:59:40.685
Château Villette. Yes.

681
00:59:42.395 --> 00:59:44.489
A dramatic late-night arrival.

682
00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:47.442
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

683
00:59:48.359 --> 00:59:52.239
We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion.

684
00:59:52.405 --> 00:59:53.622
The keepers?

685
00:59:54.532 --> 00:59:55.784
The secret war?

686
00:59:55.866 --> 00:59:57.868
Sorry for all the mystery.

687
00:59:58.786 --> 01:00:01.881
Leigh, I'm into something
here that I cannot understand.

688
01:00:02.289 --> 01:00:03.415
You?

689
01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:07.504
-Really?
-Not without your help.

690
01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:11.140
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

691
01:00:11.215 --> 01:00:12.432
Not if it works.

692
01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.184
There are always four.

693
01:00:17.972 --> 01:00:21.101
The Grand Master and the three sénéchaux

694
01:00:21.308 --> 01:00:24.733
make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

695
01:00:26.647 --> 01:00:28.615
Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now.

696
01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:38.667
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

697
01:00:38.743 --> 01:00:43.294
Philippe de Chérisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

698
01:00:43.372 --> 01:00:45.500
And that is what they
want you to believe.

699
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.129
The Priory is charged with a single task.

700
01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:52.723
To protect the greatest
secret in modern history.

701
01:00:52.798 --> 01:00:55.347
The source of God's power on Earth.

702
01:00:55.426 --> 01:00:57.178
No, that's a common misunderstanding.

703
01:00:57.303 --> 01:01:01.934
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on Earth.

704
01:01:02.933 --> 01:01:04.230
The Holy Grail.

705
01:01:04.769 --> 01:01:06.521
I don't understand.

706
01:01:06.604 --> 01:01:10.734
What power? Some magic dishes?

707
01:01:11.484 --> 01:01:15.580
Robert. Has he been telling
you that the Holy Grail is a cup?

708
01:01:30.127 --> 01:01:32.596
The Good Book did not arrive

709
01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:33.968
by facsimile from heaven.

710
01:01:34.673 --> 01:01:39.304
The Bible as we know it was
finally presided over by one man.

711
01:01:39.386 --> 01:01:41.138
The pagan emperor Constantine.

712
01:01:41.555 --> 01:01:43.683
I thought Constantine was a Christian.

713
01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:46.940
Oh, hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan

714
01:01:47.019 --> 01:01:49.647
who was baptized on his deathbed.

715
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:52.529
Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man.

716
01:01:53.526 --> 01:01:55.153
From time immemorial,

717
01:01:55.236 --> 01:01:59.833
his people had worshiped a
balance between nature's male deities

718
01:01:59.907 --> 01:02:03.411
and the goddess or sacred feminine.

719
01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:07.753
But a growing religious
turmoil was gripping Rome.

720
01:02:08.415 --> 01:02:10.417
Three centuries earlier,

721
01:02:10.501 --> 01:02:13.300
a young Jew named Jesus had come along,

722
01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:15.882
preaching love and a single God.

723
01:02:16.173 --> 01:02:18.972
Centuries after his crucifixion,

724
01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.104
Christ's followers had
grown exponentially

725
01:02:22.179 --> 01:02:25.274
and had started a religious
war against the pagans.

726
01:02:30.396 --> 01:02:33.775
Or did the pagans commence
war against the Christians?

727
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:37.661
Leigh, we can't be sure who
began the atrocities in that period.

728
01:02:37.736 --> 01:02:40.956
But we can at least agree that
the conflict grew to such proportions

729
01:02:41.031 --> 01:02:42.704
that it threatened to tear Rome in two.

730
01:02:43.701 --> 01:02:47.171
So Constantine may
have been a lifelong pagan,

731
01:02:47.246 --> 01:02:48.964
but he was also a pragmatist.

732
01:02:49.039 --> 01:02:51.542
And in 325 Anno Domini,

733
01:02:51.625 --> 01:02:56.847
he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

734
01:02:56.922 --> 01:03:00.768
Christianity was on the rise. He
didn't want his empire torn apart.

735
01:03:01.302 --> 01:03:04.397
And to strengthen this
new Christian tradition,

736
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:07.145
Constantine held a famous
ecumenical gathering

737
01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:09.773
known as the Council of Nicaea.

738
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.862
And at this council,

739
01:03:11.937 --> 01:03:16.693
the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well,

740
01:03:16.775 --> 01:03:21.030
everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels

741
01:03:21.113 --> 01:03:22.660
to the date for Easter

742
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.710
to the administering of the
sacraments, and of course,

743
01:03:25.784 --> 01:03:27.957
the immortality of Jesus.

744
01:03:28.662 --> 01:03:29.914
I don't follow.

745
01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:33.210
Well, ma chère, until
that moment in history,

746
01:03:33.292 --> 01:03:38.139
Jesus was viewed by many of
his followers as a mighty prophet,

747
01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:42.060
as a great and powerful
man, but a man nevertheless.

748
01:03:42.468 --> 01:03:44.311
A mortal man.

749
01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:45.808
Not the Son of God?

750
01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.516
Not even his nephew twice removed.

751
01:03:48.599 --> 01:03:52.445
Constantine did not
create Jesus' divinity.

752
01:03:52.519 --> 01:03:56.490
He simply sanctioned an
already widely held idea.

753
01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.408
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

754
01:03:58.484 --> 01:04:01.658
You're interpreting facts to
support your own conclusions.

755
01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:06.493
Fact. For many Christians, Jesus
was mortal one day and divine the next.

756
01:04:06.575 --> 01:04:08.577
For some Christians,
his divinity was enhanced.

757
01:04:08.661 --> 01:04:11.210
Absurd. There was even a formal
announcement of his promotion.

758
01:04:11.288 --> 01:04:13.256
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

759
01:04:13.332 --> 01:04:16.757
Excuse me. "Who is God, who is man?"

760
01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:24.344
How many have been
murdered over this question?

761
01:04:25.177 --> 01:04:28.226
As long as there has been a one true God,

762
01:04:28.305 --> 01:04:30.478
there has been killing in his name.

763
01:04:39.024 --> 01:04:41.652
Now let me show you the Grail.

764
01:04:44.196 --> 01:04:47.370
I trust you recognize The Last Supper,

765
01:04:47.449 --> 01:04:51.454
the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci.

766
01:04:53.831 --> 01:04:56.584
Now, my dear, if you
would close your eyes.

767
01:04:56.667 --> 01:04:58.510
Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

768
01:04:59.086 --> 01:05:01.430
You asked for my help, I recall.

769
01:05:01.505 --> 01:05:04.133
Allow an old man his indulgences.

770
01:05:08.554 --> 01:05:11.979
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

771
01:05:12.558 --> 01:05:14.401
- In the middle.
- Good.

772
01:05:14.476 --> 01:05:17.320
He and his disciples are breaking bread.

773
01:05:17.521 --> 01:05:20.195
And what drink?

774
01:05:20.274 --> 01:05:22.276
Wine. They drank wine.

775
01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:24.782
Splendid. And one final question.

776
01:05:24.862 --> 01:05:27.536
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

777
01:05:29.241 --> 01:05:31.289
One? The Holy Grail?

778
01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:32.369
Open your eyes.

779
01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:36.958
No single cup.

780
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:38.758
No chalice.

781
01:05:38.959 --> 01:05:41.712
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

782
01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.890
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend

783
01:05:44.965 --> 01:05:49.266
celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

784
01:05:50.387 --> 01:05:51.388
Hmm.

785
01:05:52.264 --> 01:05:54.938
Now, Robert, you could be of help to us.

786
01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:58.942
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

787
01:05:59.104 --> 01:06:02.825
Oh, no balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

788
01:06:05.861 --> 01:06:10.116
This is the original icon for
male. It's a rudimentary phallus.

789
01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:12.452
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

790
01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:14.628
This is known as the blade.

791
01:06:14.787 --> 01:06:16.789
It represents aggression and manhood.

792
01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:19.625
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

793
01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:24.005
Yes, the more penises you have,
the higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

794
01:06:24.088 --> 01:06:28.514
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

795
01:06:28.592 --> 01:06:29.889
This is called the chalice.

796
01:06:29.968 --> 01:06:35.145
And the chalice resembles a
cup or vessel or, more importantly,

797
01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.397
the shape of a woman's womb.

798
01:06:38.602 --> 01:06:41.697
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

799
01:06:41.772 --> 01:06:46.744
It is quite literally this
ancient symbol of womanhood.

800
01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:53.118
And in this case, a woman
who carried a secret so powerful

801
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.501
that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

802
01:06:57.704 --> 01:06:59.047
Wait, please.

803
01:06:59.123 --> 01:07:03.674
You're saying the Holy
Grail is a person? A woman?

804
01:07:04.545 --> 01:07:08.516
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

805
01:07:09.007 --> 01:07:10.680
But they are all men.

806
01:07:10.968 --> 01:07:12.220
Are they?

807
01:07:12.302 --> 01:07:14.805
What about that figure on
the right hand of our Lord,

808
01:07:14.888 --> 01:07:17.607
seated in the place of honor, hmm?

809
01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.277
Flowing red hair.

810
01:07:21.395 --> 01:07:23.693
Folded feminine hands.

811
01:07:24.857 --> 01:07:27.280
Hint of a bosom. No?

812
01:07:32.781 --> 01:07:36.160
It's called scotoma. The mind
sees what it chooses to see.

813
01:07:36.493 --> 01:07:37.870
Who is she?

814
01:07:39.163 --> 01:07:41.040
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

815
01:07:41.415 --> 01:07:42.462
The prostitute?

816
01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:44.885
She was no such thing.

817
01:07:45.294 --> 01:07:49.891
Smeared by the Church in
591 Anno Domini, poor dear.

818
01:07:52.342 --> 01:07:55.141
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

819
01:08:02.186 --> 01:08:04.280
This is an old wives' tale.

820
01:08:04.354 --> 01:08:05.947
The original one, in fact.

821
01:08:06.023 --> 01:08:08.117
There's virtually no empirical proof.

822
01:08:08.275 --> 01:08:11.620
He knows as well as I do there's
much evidence to support it.

823
01:08:11.695 --> 01:08:13.322
Theories. There are theories.

824
01:08:13.405 --> 01:08:16.579
Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed.

825
01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:20.291
Mirror images of each other.

826
01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:22.964
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

827
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:25.634
And venturing into the even more bizarre,

828
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:29.589
notice how Jesus and Mary
appear to be joined at the hip

829
01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:31.298
and are leaning away from each other

830
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:35.932
as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

831
01:08:36.929 --> 01:08:40.274
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

832
01:08:42.809 --> 01:08:45.358
Yes. Oh, and Robert, notice what happens

833
01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:48.862
when these two figures change position.

834
01:08:49.608 --> 01:08:52.111
Just because da Vinci
painted it doesn't make it true.

835
01:08:53.111 --> 01:08:54.988
No. But history,

836
01:08:55.405 --> 01:08:57.203
she does make it true.

837
01:08:57.407 --> 01:09:00.627
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

838
01:09:00.827 --> 01:09:01.828
Philip?

839
01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:05.007
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea

840
01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:09.883
along with any other gospels that
made Jesus appear human and not divine.

841
01:09:09.962 --> 01:09:14.889
"And the companion of the
Savior is Mary Magdalene.

842
01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:19.105
"Christ loved her more
than all the disciples

843
01:09:19.179 --> 01:09:20.897
"and used to kiss her on the..."

844
01:09:20.973 --> 01:09:23.226
But this says nothing of marriage.

845
01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:27.233
Well, actually, um... Robert.

846
01:09:27.854 --> 01:09:32.485
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

847
01:09:32.693 --> 01:09:37.164
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

848
01:09:37.322 --> 01:09:39.996
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

849
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.170
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

850
01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:47.333
"And Peter said, 'Did
he prefer her to us?'

851
01:09:48.292 --> 01:09:49.669
"And Levi answered,

852
01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:53.847
"'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

853
01:09:54.047 --> 01:09:58.518
"If the Savior made her worthy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

854
01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:03.316
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene

855
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:07.236
that it's up to her to
continue his Church.

856
01:10:08.353 --> 01:10:11.027
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

857
01:10:11.356 --> 01:10:15.202
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

858
01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:20.833
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

859
01:10:21.408 --> 01:10:26.630
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

860
01:10:28.081 --> 01:10:31.335
From the Middle English "Sangreal,"

861
01:10:31.418 --> 01:10:34.137
of the original Arthurian legend.

862
01:10:34.212 --> 01:10:39.343
Now, as two words. Can
you translate for our friend?

863
01:10:42.012 --> 01:10:44.140
It means "royal blood."

864
01:10:45.223 --> 01:10:49.444
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ,

865
01:10:49.853 --> 01:10:55.155
it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

866
01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:59.071
But how could Christ
have a bloodline unless...

867
01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:01.998
Mary was pregnant at
the time of the Crucifixion.

868
01:11:10.749 --> 01:11:15.220
For her own safety and for
that of Christ's unborn child,

869
01:11:15.295 --> 01:11:18.344
she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

870
01:11:18.423 --> 01:11:23.520
And here, it is said, she
gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

871
01:11:24.846 --> 01:11:27.224
They know the child's name.

872
01:11:28.183 --> 01:11:30.060
- A little girl.
- Yes.

873
01:11:30.268 --> 01:11:32.487
If that were true, it's
adding insult to injury.

874
01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:33.609
Why?

875
01:11:33.814 --> 01:11:37.444
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

876
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:39.369
People found God through sex?

877
01:11:39.569 --> 01:11:42.539
In paganism, women were
worshiped as a route to heaven,

878
01:11:42.614 --> 01:11:45.458
but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that

879
01:11:45.617 --> 01:11:47.585
in salvation through Jesus Christ.

880
01:11:47.661 --> 01:11:50.915
And he who keeps the keys
to heaven rules the world.

881
01:11:50.997 --> 01:11:53.341
Women, then, are a
huge threat to the Church.

882
01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.344
The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes

883
01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.720
what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

884
01:11:59.923 --> 01:12:02.301
The Malleus Maleficarum.

885
01:12:03.427 --> 01:12:05.304
The Witches' Hammer.

886
01:12:05.387 --> 01:12:09.233
It instructed the clergy on
how to locate, torture and kill

887
01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:10.729
all freethinking women.

888
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.949
In three centuries of witch hunts,

889
01:12:17.357 --> 01:12:21.203
50, 000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

890
01:12:21.278 --> 01:12:23.906
Oh, at least that. Some say millions.

891
01:12:24.489 --> 01:12:26.207
Imagine, then, Robert,

892
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.580
that Christ's throne might
live on in a female child.

893
01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.584
You asked what would
be worth killing for.

894
01:12:35.167 --> 01:12:38.762
Witness the greatest
cover-up in human history.

895
01:12:39.546 --> 01:12:41.924
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion

896
01:12:42.007 --> 01:12:44.385
has defended for over 20 centuries.

897
01:12:44.468 --> 01:12:47.642
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

898
01:12:48.305 --> 01:12:51.900
The keepers of the
proof of our true past.

899
01:12:51.975 --> 01:12:55.980
They are the protectors of the
living descendants of Jesus Christ

900
01:12:58.106 --> 01:12:59.858
and Mary Magdalene.

901
01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:10.870
Sir Leigh?

902
01:13:11.661 --> 01:13:14.961
Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom.

903
01:13:15.665 --> 01:13:18.714
His sauces are not that fantastic.

904
01:13:21.087 --> 01:13:22.680
Yes, can I help you?

905
01:13:22.756 --> 01:13:24.804
Yes. They're on the news now.

906
01:13:27.844 --> 01:13:31.269
Living descendants? Is it possible?

907
01:13:31.348 --> 01:13:32.975
It's not impossible.

908
01:13:34.226 --> 01:13:37.901
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

909
01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:39.902
You are wanted for four murders!

910
01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:42.488
That's why Vernet said, "Killing spree."

911
01:13:42.567 --> 01:13:46.322
You come into my home, playing
on my passions for the Grail.

912
01:13:46.404 --> 01:13:48.998
- That's why he needed you, Sophie.
- You will leave my house!

913
01:13:49.074 --> 01:13:51.076
-Leigh, listen!
-No, I'm calling the police.

914
01:13:51.159 --> 01:13:53.161
Jacques Saunière was her grandfather.

915
01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.250
You're the obsessive
Priory scholar, Leigh.

916
01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.586
You still keep lists of
who might be in the Priory?

917
01:14:01.753 --> 01:14:04.597
I'll bet Jacques Saunière
was on one of those lists.

918
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:09.053
He was on your list of who
could be Grand Master, wasn't he?

919
01:14:09.386 --> 01:14:11.935
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

920
01:14:12.138 --> 01:14:17.440
Consider. Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

921
01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:20.773
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other sénéchaux dead?

922
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:23.109
What if you yourself were
dying, a Grand Master?

923
01:14:23.733 --> 01:14:27.203
You'd have to pass the secret
on to someone you could trust.

924
01:14:27.404 --> 01:14:29.122
Someone outside the society.

925
01:14:29.281 --> 01:14:33.957
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

926
01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.375
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

927
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.877
Not really.

928
01:14:43.461 --> 01:14:45.680
No, that's impossible.

929
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.473
Can that really...

930
01:14:52.846 --> 01:14:54.143
Is it the keystone?

931
01:14:57.517 --> 01:15:00.145
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

932
01:15:00.228 --> 01:15:02.401
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

933
01:15:20.332 --> 01:15:22.005
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

934
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:26.346
What's Fache thinking? The
truck is here. They're inside.

935
01:15:32.052 --> 01:15:33.053
Oh...

936
01:15:35.138 --> 01:15:36.264
Yes.

937
01:15:36.473 --> 01:15:39.272
As the legend foretold,

938
01:15:41.061 --> 01:15:43.359
"It hides beneath the Rose."

939
01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:45.031
Oh, my.

940
01:15:50.362 --> 01:15:51.363
Oh!

941
01:15:51.947 --> 01:15:53.415
Leigh.

942
01:15:56.826 --> 01:15:58.294
- Leigh?
- Hmm?

943
01:15:59.162 --> 01:16:00.209
Please.

944
01:16:00.413 --> 01:16:02.415
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

945
01:16:04.834 --> 01:16:06.882
Inside the keystone,

946
01:16:08.213 --> 01:16:09.840
there'll be a map.

947
01:16:09.923 --> 01:16:12.722
A map that will lead
us to the Holy Grail.

948
01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.604
To be trained by the
Grand Master himself.

949
01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:23.904
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

950
01:16:26.439 --> 01:16:29.443
And he must have sung
you the riddle songs.

951
01:16:29.526 --> 01:16:31.073
I know some of them.

952
01:16:40.328 --> 01:16:42.171
Can you keep secrets?

953
01:16:43.748 --> 01:16:46.627
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

954
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:48.758
And codes?

955
01:16:50.046 --> 01:16:54.051
I imagine they lie
down for you like lovers.

956
01:16:57.053 --> 01:17:02.059
A sénéchal. A guardian of the
Grail right here in my own home.

957
01:17:02.142 --> 01:17:05.112
Tell him, please. I
don't know any of this.

958
01:17:05.228 --> 01:17:08.107
Leigh, it's not that
simple. She doesn't...

959
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:10.901
Robert!

960
01:17:16.239 --> 01:17:17.616
Do not move, woman.

961
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:22.871
Cripple.

962
01:17:25.248 --> 01:17:26.795
Put the box on the table.

963
01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.336
What, this trifle?

964
01:17:29.919 --> 01:17:33.549
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

965
01:17:34.090 --> 01:17:37.139
Put the keystone on the table.

966
01:17:38.094 --> 01:17:39.721
You will not succeed.

967
01:17:42.015 --> 01:17:45.189
Only the worthy can unlock the stone.

968
01:18:14.547 --> 01:18:16.970
Rip the gate down.

969
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.188
Well, well, my dear.

970
01:18:26.351 --> 01:18:27.694
Sit down.

971
01:18:27.852 --> 01:18:29.274
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

972
01:18:29.479 --> 01:18:31.607
- Are you?
- Yeah.

973
01:18:31.815 --> 01:18:34.113
Yes, well, make yourself
useful, you French fool.

974
01:18:34.192 --> 01:18:36.365
Get something to restrain this monster.

975
01:18:41.533 --> 01:18:43.126
Above the joint.

976
01:18:43.993 --> 01:18:48.043
Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay.

977
01:18:48.748 --> 01:18:50.170
He's wearing a cilice.

978
01:18:50.959 --> 01:18:53.178
-A what?
-Well, look.

979
01:18:55.672 --> 01:18:58.642
Inflicts pain so he can
suffer as Christ suffered.

980
01:18:58.716 --> 01:18:59.842
Opus Dei.

981
01:18:59.926 --> 01:19:01.428
Fache is Opus Dei.

982
01:19:02.929 --> 01:19:06.024
The policeman who's chasing
us. He wears the cross in the world.

983
01:19:06.099 --> 01:19:07.100
Robert.

984
01:19:10.061 --> 01:19:13.361
Well, I must say, you
two are anything but dull.

985
01:19:14.607 --> 01:19:15.608
Leigh?

986
01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.241
You want what's in this box?

987
01:19:20.905 --> 01:19:22.748
We need a way out of here.

988
01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:27.045
Well, actually, I do have a plane.

989
01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:40.141
-Robert! Where do we go?
-Come along.

990
01:19:40.216 --> 01:19:42.059
-In here. Come in.
-Over here.

991
01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.729
Get the door. Hurry

992
01:19:46.764 --> 01:19:48.812
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

993
01:19:48.892 --> 01:19:50.144
Watch out!

994
01:19:51.519 --> 01:19:53.146
Be careful.

995
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:54.446
Come, Rem...

996
01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.623
Shit.

997
01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:07.748
Easy.

998
01:20:30.767 --> 01:20:31.859
Jesus!

999
01:20:31.935 --> 01:20:32.982
Apropos.

1000
01:20:35.772 --> 01:20:37.615
I can't imagine what your complaint is.

1001
01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:40.694
I'd be within my rights to shoot
you and let you rot in my woods!

1002
01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.238
Put that away. We might need him.

1003
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:45.156
Better.

1004
01:20:52.163 --> 01:20:53.790
Opus Dei.

1005
01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:57.377
-What is it?
-A conservative Catholic sect.

1006
01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.383
Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican.

1007
01:20:59.462 --> 01:21:02.966
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1008
01:21:03.049 --> 01:21:05.097
No, no, no. Not the Vatican

1009
01:21:05.176 --> 01:21:07.804
and not Opus Dei, but we
are in the middle of a war.

1010
01:21:07.887 --> 01:21:10.436
And one that has been going on forever.

1011
01:21:10.515 --> 01:21:12.768
On the one side stands the Priory

1012
01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:15.694
and on the other an
ancient group of despots

1013
01:21:15.812 --> 01:21:18.190
with members hidden
in high-ranking positions

1014
01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:20.150
throughout the Church.

1015
01:21:20.233 --> 01:21:24.534
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1016
01:21:24.612 --> 01:21:27.866
And that throughout
history, they seek out and kill

1017
01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.826
the living descendants of Jesus Christ.

1018
01:21:29.909 --> 01:21:31.752
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1019
01:21:33.454 --> 01:21:34.580
What if the world discovers

1020
01:21:34.664 --> 01:21:37.793
that the greatest story
ever told is actually a lie?

1021
01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:41.550
The Vatican faces a crisis
of faith unprecedented.

1022
01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.925
I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.

1023
01:21:46.718 --> 01:21:51.224
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France

1024
01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:54.230
and could you make the plane ready for...

1025
01:21:57.103 --> 01:21:58.275
Zürich.

1026
01:21:58.855 --> 01:22:00.323
Yes. No, we love Zürich.

1027
01:22:08.197 --> 01:22:10.746
What the hell do you
mean, you lost them? Collet.

1028
01:22:12.869 --> 01:22:14.337
You're the one who lost them.

1029
01:22:14.704 --> 01:22:16.081
You control every step
of this investigation.

1030
01:22:16.247 --> 01:22:18.841
You don't let anybody breathe.

1031
01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:22.053
You're acting like you lost your mind.

1032
01:22:25.423 --> 01:22:28.267
What is it with these two birds?

1033
01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:35.226
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1034
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.354
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1035
01:23:06.964 --> 01:23:08.807
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1036
01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.268
Did you kill Jacques Saunière?

1037
01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:17.021
I am the messenger of God.

1038
01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:23.068
Did you kill my grandfather?

1039
01:23:26.192 --> 01:23:27.660
I am the messenger...

1040
01:23:28.319 --> 01:23:32.369
Each breath you take is a sin.

1041
01:23:33.866 --> 01:23:36.289
No shadow will be safe again.

1042
01:23:36.494 --> 01:23:41.216
For you will be hunted by angels.

1043
01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:44.635
You believe in God?

1044
01:23:45.878 --> 01:23:48.381
Your God doesn't forgive murderers.

1045
01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.769
He burns them.

1046
01:24:04.981 --> 01:24:05.982
Sophie.

1047
01:24:32.592 --> 01:24:34.310
The Teacher will be pleased.

1048
01:24:34.385 --> 01:24:36.683
What will you do once you have the Grail?

1049
01:24:36.762 --> 01:24:37.809
Destroy it.

1050
01:24:37.889 --> 01:24:41.564
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1051
01:24:43.227 --> 01:24:44.604
And the heir?

1052
01:24:48.399 --> 01:24:51.903
Will you exercise the
final edict? Spill his blood?

1053
01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.080
There will be no need.

1054
01:24:54.155 --> 01:24:59.002
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1055
01:24:59.076 --> 01:25:01.795
There is no way to
prove a living bloodline.

1056
01:25:02.497 --> 01:25:04.124
But if you had to,

1057
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:08.799
would you do as councils
have done before us?

1058
01:25:17.762 --> 01:25:19.105
Christ...

1059
01:25:23.809 --> 01:25:28.110
Christ sacrificed his life for
the betterment of humanity.

1060
01:25:31.734 --> 01:25:34.613
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1061
01:25:41.786 --> 01:25:43.584
I need the flight plan.

1062
01:25:43.871 --> 01:25:44.918
Ten minutes.

1063
01:25:45.873 --> 01:25:48.251
I asked you to get it for me.

1064
01:25:49.377 --> 01:25:51.300
I'm on break.

1065
01:25:52.755 --> 01:25:54.348
Come back in 10 minutes.

1066
01:25:56.342 --> 01:25:58.515
My nose! My nose!

1067
01:25:59.095 --> 01:26:00.517
The flight plan, please.

1068
01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.681
You asshole!

1069
01:26:14.944 --> 01:26:16.662
It's not "cross."

1070
01:26:17.905 --> 01:26:19.202
"Spear"?

1071
01:26:23.786 --> 01:26:25.333
What happened to her?

1072
01:26:26.122 --> 01:26:27.715
No one knows.

1073
01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:31.427
Mary Magdalene lived
out her days in hiding.

1074
01:26:33.212 --> 01:26:35.635
And the zealots pursued her still,

1075
01:26:36.215 --> 01:26:40.595
even in death, trying to
destroy proof of her existence.

1076
01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:43.940
But she always had her Knights.

1077
01:26:44.015 --> 01:26:46.484
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1078
01:26:46.767 --> 01:26:49.361
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus,

1079
01:26:49.854 --> 01:26:53.233
to kneel before the
bones of Mary Magdalene,

1080
01:26:53.316 --> 01:26:56.616
was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power,

1081
01:26:56.694 --> 01:26:57.695
who were oppressed.

1082
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:02.621
Ultimately, the Priory hid her
remains and the proof of her bloodline

1083
01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:05.374
until most believed her sarcophagus,

1084
01:27:06.370 --> 01:27:08.043
the Holy Grail,

1085
01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:12.010
was finally lost in time.

1086
01:27:22.928 --> 01:27:23.929
What are you doing?

1087
01:27:24.013 --> 01:27:26.687
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1088
01:27:26.766 --> 01:27:28.234
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1089
01:27:28.559 --> 01:27:33.565
-In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation.
-"Beneath the rose."

1090
01:27:46.952 --> 01:27:48.420
We need a mirror.

1091
01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:51.465
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1092
01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:52.792
Thank you.

1093
01:27:57.672 --> 01:28:01.643
"In London lies a knight a Pope interred

1094
01:28:01.842 --> 01:28:05.563
"His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred

1095
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:08.900
"You seek the orb that
ought be on his tomb

1096
01:28:09.266 --> 01:28:12.941
"It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb"

1097
01:28:13.104 --> 01:28:17.075
"In London lies a
knight a Pope interred"?

1098
01:28:17.274 --> 01:28:21.074
A knight whose funeral was
presided over by the Pope.

1099
01:28:21.278 --> 01:28:24.578
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1100
01:28:24.657 --> 01:28:25.749
Templars.

1101
01:28:25.825 --> 01:28:28.920
And there's just one place to
bury a Templar knight in London.

1102
01:28:28.994 --> 01:28:30.120
Temple Church.

1103
01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.377
Temple Church. If you'll
excuse me, my dear,

1104
01:28:32.456 --> 01:28:35.300
Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1105
01:28:35.835 --> 01:28:37.212
Leigh.

1106
01:28:38.963 --> 01:28:41.341
Harboring and transporting fugitives?

1107
01:28:42.133 --> 01:28:44.682
You are already implicated enough.

1108
01:28:45.886 --> 01:28:49.481
You and I, Robert, have observed history.

1109
01:28:49.682 --> 01:28:51.480
Time has been our glass.

1110
01:28:52.476 --> 01:28:55.696
We are in history now. Living it.

1111
01:28:57.398 --> 01:28:59.025
Making it.

1112
01:28:59.734 --> 01:29:01.327
"Implicated"?

1113
01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.951
I am on a Grail quest.

1114
01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:07.200
Forgive me, Robert,

1115
01:29:07.283 --> 01:29:09.706
but you two may well
have given this old man

1116
01:29:09.785 --> 01:29:12.129
the greatest night of his life.

1117
01:29:13.998 --> 01:29:15.124
Thank you.

1118
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:19.337
He's going to want more money.

1119
01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.650
I suppose this is a new
technique for investigations.

1120
01:29:40.816 --> 01:29:45.947
I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland.

1121
01:29:46.197 --> 01:29:48.416
No extradition.

1122
01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:57.338
The controller filed charges. Ari
was on dispatch. He called me.

1123
01:30:01.545 --> 01:30:04.640
What's going on, Bezu?

1124
01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:10.514
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1125
01:30:10.888 --> 01:30:12.435
Yes.

1126
01:30:17.728 --> 01:30:21.232
A bishop of my order called me.

1127
01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:23.693
He said a killer came
to him in confession.

1128
01:30:23.859 --> 01:30:26.612
His name was Robert Langdon.

1129
01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.909
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

1130
01:30:31.075 --> 01:30:33.828
That he would keep killing.

1131
01:30:34.203 --> 01:30:36.672
He said I had to stop him.

1132
01:30:38.707 --> 01:30:42.553
The bishop broke his
vows to tell me this.

1133
01:30:42.711 --> 01:30:46.136
He charged me to stop Robert Langdon.

1134
01:30:49.093 --> 01:30:53.849
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1135
01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.438
The bishop?

1136
01:30:57.768 --> 01:30:59.862
God himself?

1137
01:31:08.487 --> 01:31:11.616
They've changed their
flight plan to London.

1138
01:31:40.311 --> 01:31:44.032
I have them, tower. Relay
Hawker to land and hold on tarmac.

1139
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:43.549
-Secure the area!
-Wider!

1140
01:32:43.707 --> 01:32:45.835
-Armed police!
-You two, round the back!

1141
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:49.384
Armed police! Put your hands in the air!

1142
01:32:49.588 --> 01:32:51.386
-Three men up!
-Ready!

1143
01:32:51.465 --> 01:32:53.763
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1144
01:32:54.551 --> 01:32:56.929
I'm afraid that's easier
said than done in my case.

1145
01:32:59.014 --> 01:33:00.311
Oh, good morning.

1146
01:33:00.391 --> 01:33:03.486
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1147
01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:06.404
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives,

1148
01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.232
and you may have a hostage onboard.

1149
01:33:08.315 --> 01:33:09.783
I'm to take you all into custody.

1150
01:33:09.858 --> 01:33:12.361
Sadly, I have an important
medical appointment

1151
01:33:12.444 --> 01:33:13.661
which I can't afford to miss.

1152
01:33:13.737 --> 01:33:14.954
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1153
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:17.874
This is serious, sir. The French
police are on their way. Stop!

1154
01:33:18.575 --> 01:33:21.749
Inspector, I can't afford the
time to indulge your games.

1155
01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:23.206
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1156
01:33:23.288 --> 01:33:25.336
If it's so important for you to stop us,

1157
01:33:25.416 --> 01:33:27.635
then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1158
01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:29.841
You can start with him.

1159
01:33:35.134 --> 01:33:36.511
Search the plane.

1160
01:33:37.219 --> 01:33:38.436
All right.

1161
01:33:50.649 --> 01:33:52.322
I could run them over.

1162
01:33:57.781 --> 01:33:58.782
Bad tip.

1163
01:34:00.743 --> 01:34:02.120
Let him go.

1164
01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:09.085
The French cannot be trusted.

1165
01:34:17.843 --> 01:34:18.890
Everyone comfy?

1166
01:34:21.346 --> 01:34:22.393
Biscuits?

1167
01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:24.358
They didn't notice anything?

1168
01:34:24.975 --> 01:34:29.151
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1169
01:34:43.368 --> 01:34:45.962
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1170
01:34:46.163 --> 01:34:47.415
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1171
01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:50.926
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1172
01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.553
I am honored.

1173
01:34:52.795 --> 01:34:57.642
By the time you get to
London, I will have the Grail.

1174
01:35:03.013 --> 01:35:07.860
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1175
01:35:07.935 --> 01:35:10.939
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1176
01:35:12.356 --> 01:35:14.029
This council does not exist.

1177
01:35:15.025 --> 01:35:16.743
As it never has.

1178
01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:23.368
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1179
01:35:30.874 --> 01:35:32.842
Keep an eye out for the police.

1180
01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:48.726
I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed

1181
01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:52.063
by the way you
withstood my little airplane.

1182
01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:55.357
Did he never tell you?

1183
01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.865
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1184
01:35:58.944 --> 01:36:00.696
How old were you?

1185
01:36:00.779 --> 01:36:01.905
Seven.

1186
01:36:04.616 --> 01:36:07.995
Treading water all night
long, screaming his lungs out

1187
01:36:08.078 --> 01:36:10.001
to the echoes screaming back.

1188
01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:12.629
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1189
01:36:12.833 --> 01:36:13.925
Help!

1190
01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.428
It was a long time ago.

1191
01:36:16.503 --> 01:36:18.380
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1192
01:36:18.463 --> 01:36:22.764
You, above all people, shouldn't be
one to dismiss the influence of the past.

1193
01:36:28.473 --> 01:36:32.694
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1194
01:36:32.769 --> 01:36:33.770
I don't know.

1195
01:36:34.313 --> 01:36:37.066
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself,

1196
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:38.947
which is especially odd

1197
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:42.454
since legend suggests he may
not know his own true identity.

1198
01:36:50.454 --> 01:36:51.455
Hello?

1199
01:36:52.247 --> 01:36:54.875
Why do they make them so scary?

1200
01:37:00.505 --> 01:37:01.631
Oh, it's cold.

1201
01:37:01.798 --> 01:37:05.143
"In London lies a
knight a Pope interred."

1202
01:37:14.436 --> 01:37:17.815
So which tomb has an orb?

1203
01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:23.529
Two wear tunics over their armor

1204
01:37:23.612 --> 01:37:26.741
and, uh, two have full-length robes.

1205
01:37:27.824 --> 01:37:29.542
Two are grasping swords.

1206
01:37:29.993 --> 01:37:33.623
And one... Two are praying.

1207
01:37:35.582 --> 01:37:37.676
This one has his arms at his sides.

1208
01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:41.426
Oh, and this poor fellow has
almost disappeared entirely.

1209
01:37:41.630 --> 01:37:46.352
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1210
01:37:47.219 --> 01:37:50.098
"Ought be on his tomb." Are
we looking for a missing orb?

1211
01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:52.023
Maybe. Over here, see.

1212
01:37:57.062 --> 01:37:58.780
These aren't tombs.

1213
01:37:58.855 --> 01:38:01.324
-What? Yes, of course they are.
-No.

1214
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.528
- They're effigies.
- What?

1215
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:05.704
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1216
01:38:05.862 --> 01:38:07.330
This place is wrong.

1217
01:38:09.366 --> 01:38:12.711
Can we go now? We should go.

1218
01:38:15.872 --> 01:38:17.374
Sophie! No!

1219
01:38:19.334 --> 01:38:20.756
Where is the keystone?

1220
01:38:21.878 --> 01:38:23.130
Do not test me!

1221
01:38:23.213 --> 01:38:24.510
-Let her go!
-Don't you hurt her.

1222
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:26.683
- Give me the keystone! Give it to me!
- Can you stop that?

1223
01:38:26.758 --> 01:38:28.510
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1224
01:38:28.593 --> 01:38:31.847
Just let her go, and you and I
can... We'll come to some agreement.

1225
01:38:33.098 --> 01:38:34.566
Remy.

1226
01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:40.443
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1227
01:38:41.732 --> 01:38:44.076
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1228
01:38:45.193 --> 01:38:47.571
- Yes, I do.
- Stop that. What do you think you're doing?

1229
01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:54.203
Thank you, Professor. For a
moment, this was getting complicated.

1230
01:38:54.286 --> 01:38:56.334
This is absurd. Oh, for God's sake, man!

1231
01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:02.052
That was satisfying.

1232
01:39:02.127 --> 01:39:04.004
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1233
01:39:07.257 --> 01:39:08.975
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1234
01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:10.428
What?

1235
01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:17.396
Here. You okay?

1236
01:39:23.273 --> 01:39:24.274
Sorry.

1237
01:40:05.315 --> 01:40:07.113
I don't think he's following.

1238
01:40:15.325 --> 01:40:19.205
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1239
01:40:21.331 --> 01:40:24.551
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1240
01:40:32.509 --> 01:40:36.855
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1241
01:40:37.889 --> 01:40:40.017
Let's see if he complains so now.

1242
01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:43.024
Are you the Teacher?

1243
01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.320
I am.

1244
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:53.615
Superbly done. You've
been of great service.

1245
01:40:57.117 --> 01:41:00.121
The cryptex has yet to
be opened. I can still serve.

1246
01:41:00.203 --> 01:41:02.376
You've done enough.

1247
01:41:05.459 --> 01:41:09.134
We cannot let ego deter us from our goal.

1248
01:41:10.338 --> 01:41:12.306
I understand.

1249
01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.426
Good.

1250
01:41:17.637 --> 01:41:22.518
Wait here, at this house of Opus
Dei, and you will be rewarded.

1251
01:41:22.601 --> 01:41:24.820
I will dispose of the old man.

1252
01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.606
Bless you, Silas.

1253
01:41:29.649 --> 01:41:30.901
Teacher.

1254
01:41:39.075 --> 01:41:40.827
Christ be with you.

1255
01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:48.427
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1256
01:41:49.002 --> 01:41:51.050
If we're gonna help
Leigh, that's too long.

1257
01:42:02.766 --> 01:42:04.268
Where are you going?

1258
01:42:04.351 --> 01:42:06.479
Getting you a library card.

1259
01:42:10.106 --> 01:42:12.234
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1260
01:42:12.317 --> 01:42:14.820
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1261
01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:24.667
That's great.

1262
01:42:25.622 --> 01:42:27.795
Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

1263
01:42:30.502 --> 01:42:31.799
Thanks.

1264
01:42:32.462 --> 01:42:34.806
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1265
01:42:36.132 --> 01:42:39.477
"In London lies a
knight a Pope interred."

1266
01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:41.305
Compounding keywords.

1267
01:42:41.513 --> 01:42:44.392
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1268
01:42:45.016 --> 01:42:49.021
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1269
01:42:53.441 --> 01:42:55.694
Can you believe how well I did?

1270
01:42:57.279 --> 01:42:59.407
I even convinced the monk.

1271
01:43:00.282 --> 01:43:02.205
I should be in theater.

1272
01:43:08.915 --> 01:43:11.919
A toast to our success, Teacher.

1273
01:43:12.002 --> 01:43:14.425
The end of the journey is near.

1274
01:43:16.965 --> 01:43:20.265
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1275
01:43:25.682 --> 01:43:29.357
There's your problem, mate. It's
your basic linguistic coincidence.

1276
01:43:29.769 --> 01:43:32.022
See, keywords keep
coming up with the writings

1277
01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:35.154
of some bloke named Alexander Pope.

1278
01:43:35.233 --> 01:43:36.485
"A. Pope."

1279
01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:39.863
Your grandfather was a genius.

1280
01:43:44.784 --> 01:43:45.831
Come on.

1281
01:44:20.487 --> 01:44:22.330
Emergency. Which service do you require?

1282
01:44:22.405 --> 01:44:27.502
I know the location of two
murderers wanted by French police.

1283
01:44:31.414 --> 01:44:33.633
We've just had a 999 call.

1284
01:44:33.708 --> 01:44:36.177
Triangulation leads back to Docklands.

1285
01:44:36.252 --> 01:44:38.425
Caller was male. Claimed
your two murderers

1286
01:44:38.505 --> 01:44:41.099
are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1287
01:44:50.266 --> 01:44:54.362
The knight we're looking
for is Sir Isaac Newton.

1288
01:44:55.897 --> 01:44:59.618
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1289
01:45:00.110 --> 01:45:02.363
Gravity, for God sakes.

1290
01:45:03.738 --> 01:45:06.912
And if you choose to believe,

1291
01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:11.121
he was also a Grand
Master of the Priory as well.

1292
01:45:22.132 --> 01:45:24.601
But if he offended the Catholic Church,

1293
01:45:24.676 --> 01:45:28.556
the Pope would be the last
person to preside over his funeral.

1294
01:45:28.638 --> 01:45:31.061
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1295
01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:34.315
"In London lies a
knight a Pope interred."

1296
01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:37.193
Sir Isaac Newton's
funeral was presided over

1297
01:45:37.272 --> 01:45:41.402
by his good friend, his
colleague, Alexander Pope.

1298
01:45:41.484 --> 01:45:43.987
A. Pope. His first initial.

1299
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:45.572
How did I miss that?

1300
01:45:46.322 --> 01:45:47.369
Here.

1301
01:45:47.449 --> 01:45:50.578
Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb.

1302
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:53.213
An orb.

1303
01:45:53.288 --> 01:45:54.961
Yes. Which one?

1304
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:58.384
It's not possible to tell if
a particular orb is missing.

1305
01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:02.090
"An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb."

1306
01:46:02.172 --> 01:46:04.266
Solar system. The planets.

1307
01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:06.843
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1308
01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:09.600
See, our moon is missing.

1309
01:46:09.679 --> 01:46:12.057
The moons of Saturn and
Jupiter. They're not here.

1310
01:46:12.974 --> 01:46:15.147
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1311
01:46:17.479 --> 01:46:20.028
Robert. These tracks.

1312
01:46:21.149 --> 01:46:23.447
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1313
01:46:26.654 --> 01:46:28.031
Teabing was here.

1314
01:46:29.449 --> 01:46:30.701
He was alone.

1315
01:46:32.535 --> 01:46:36.631
When the two of you arrived
at my home as you did,

1316
01:46:37.832 --> 01:46:40.335
others might call it God's will.

1317
01:46:41.586 --> 01:46:44.089
I believed that if I had the cryptex

1318
01:46:44.214 --> 01:46:46.637
I could solve the riddle alone.

1319
01:46:48.384 --> 01:46:50.057
But I was unworthy.

1320
01:46:50.136 --> 01:46:51.183
But you...

1321
01:46:52.138 --> 01:46:54.687
You have a reason to be here.

1322
01:46:54.766 --> 01:46:57.986
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1323
01:46:58.728 --> 01:47:00.947
Your grandfather and the other sénéchaux

1324
01:47:01.022 --> 01:47:02.945
would not have lied with dying breath

1325
01:47:03.024 --> 01:47:05.868
unless they knew their
secret was preserved.

1326
01:47:08.488 --> 01:47:11.162
How could you know Saunière's last words?

1327
01:47:11.241 --> 01:47:12.288
Leigh.

1328
01:47:13.409 --> 01:47:15.662
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1329
01:47:16.287 --> 01:47:17.709
You are a murderer.

1330
01:47:17.789 --> 01:47:21.043
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1331
01:47:21.125 --> 01:47:24.925
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1332
01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:29.092
You self-righteous bastard!

1333
01:47:29.175 --> 01:47:30.597
We... We need to just walk away.

1334
01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:32.475
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1335
01:47:35.932 --> 01:47:37.434
I'll do what I have to now.

1336
01:47:42.772 --> 01:47:43.944
Anything.

1337
01:47:48.111 --> 01:47:49.533
Do you understand?

1338
01:47:51.239 --> 01:47:52.616
So now,

1339
01:47:54.117 --> 01:47:56.119
can't we all be friends again?

1340
01:47:57.453 --> 01:47:58.750
This way.

1341
01:48:34.991 --> 01:48:38.837
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1342
01:48:40.663 --> 01:48:41.835
I'm listening now.

1343
01:48:42.332 --> 01:48:43.834
For 2000 years

1344
01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:48.380
the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind,

1345
01:48:49.047 --> 01:48:54.019
crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1346
01:48:54.427 --> 01:48:58.807
Proof of Jesus' mortality can
bring an end to all that suffering,

1347
01:48:59.349 --> 01:49:01.522
drive this church of lies to its knees.

1348
01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:05.647
Armed police! Ahh!

1349
01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:06.777
Drop your weapon!

1350
01:49:10.568 --> 01:49:12.991
Stop, Silas!

1351
01:49:24.374 --> 01:49:27.218
We are betrayed, my son.

1352
01:49:28.211 --> 01:49:30.339
The living heir must be revealed.

1353
01:49:31.297 --> 01:49:33.595
Jesus must be shown for what he was.

1354
01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:36.554
Not miraculous, simply man.

1355
01:49:38.054 --> 01:49:39.226
I'm sorry.

1356
01:49:41.683 --> 01:49:42.775
Armed police!

1357
01:49:43.226 --> 01:49:46.355
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1358
01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:58.583
Put it down now! Put it down!

1359
01:50:06.332 --> 01:50:08.426
I am a ghost.

1360
01:50:09.502 --> 01:50:12.255
The dark con can be exposed.

1361
01:50:12.338 --> 01:50:17.310
Mankind can finally be set
free, and we can do it, Robert.

1362
01:50:18.928 --> 01:50:20.225
The three of us.

1363
01:50:38.364 --> 01:50:39.616
How is Silas?

1364
01:50:39.949 --> 01:50:42.293
Is he... Is he alive?

1365
01:50:42.785 --> 01:50:43.832
The monk?

1366
01:50:47.373 --> 01:50:50.297
Bishop, how would you
know this killer's name?

1367
01:50:50.793 --> 01:50:53.387
Get me out of here, Fache.

1368
01:50:54.005 --> 01:50:55.131
Wait.

1369
01:50:58.551 --> 01:51:01.646
Langdon never came to
you in confession, did he?

1370
01:51:02.305 --> 01:51:06.185
One of your followers called
you about the crime-scene photos.

1371
01:51:07.477 --> 01:51:09.150
I cannot be implicated here.

1372
01:51:10.396 --> 01:51:12.524
There are still important
works to be done.

1373
01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:15.493
You used me.

1374
01:51:17.403 --> 01:51:19.451
God uses us all.

1375
01:51:20.239 --> 01:51:21.786
Help me, Fache.

1376
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:24.076
Take him.

1377
01:51:28.831 --> 01:51:30.674
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1378
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:32.798
I'm going to need a trace.

1379
01:51:35.671 --> 01:51:37.514
Your Silas is dead.

1380
01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:46.520
The Priory's sacred charge

1381
01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:49.648
was to reveal the heir at the
dawn of the new millennium.

1382
01:51:50.561 --> 01:51:55.818
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1383
01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:59.370
The Priory failed in their sacred charge.

1384
01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.661
So, what choice did I have?

1385
01:52:06.911 --> 01:52:08.709
I sought out the enemy.

1386
01:52:10.206 --> 01:52:14.177
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1387
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:18.469
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1388
01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:21.889
Rector, I made them call me.

1389
01:52:22.844 --> 01:52:23.970
"Teacher."

1390
01:52:24.053 --> 01:52:25.396
- Why don't you and I...
- No.

1391
01:52:25.471 --> 01:52:28.065
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1392
01:52:28.599 --> 01:52:29.976
Do it.

1393
01:52:30.059 --> 01:52:31.686
No, I mean it. Down.

1394
01:52:32.728 --> 01:52:35.572
Not you. No, my dear, you.

1395
01:52:38.192 --> 01:52:40.286
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1396
01:52:41.237 --> 01:52:43.706
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1397
01:52:44.699 --> 01:52:48.329
All the oppression of the
poor and the powerless

1398
01:52:48.411 --> 01:52:51.381
of those of different skin, of women.

1399
01:52:51.455 --> 01:52:54.174
You can put an end to all that.

1400
01:52:54.917 --> 01:52:58.091
You must explode
the truth onto the world.

1401
01:52:59.422 --> 01:53:00.890
It's your duty.

1402
01:53:03.801 --> 01:53:06.224
You know the answer to this riddle.

1403
01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:09.607
Open the cryptex,

1404
01:53:11.142 --> 01:53:12.860
and I'll put down the gun.

1405
01:53:30.995 --> 01:53:33.089
I have no idea how.

1406
01:53:33.164 --> 01:53:35.166
I don't know the code.

1407
01:53:35.249 --> 01:53:37.798
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1408
01:53:43.549 --> 01:53:45.472
Like your grandfather, then.

1409
01:53:46.594 --> 01:53:49.097
Willing to die for your secret.

1410
01:53:50.765 --> 01:53:53.689
But, by the way you've
been looking at your hero,

1411
01:53:54.477 --> 01:53:58.823
I wonder, would you let him die for you?

1412
01:53:59.523 --> 01:54:01.901
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1413
01:54:01.984 --> 01:54:04.157
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1414
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:05.912
I don't know how.

1415
01:54:05.988 --> 01:54:08.036
Open it or he dies.

1416
01:54:08.115 --> 01:54:10.209
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1417
01:54:10.284 --> 01:54:11.581
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1418
01:54:11.661 --> 01:54:13.004
Stop it!

1419
01:54:18.834 --> 01:54:20.836
She can't do it, Leigh.

1420
01:54:32.556 --> 01:54:34.433
But give... Give me a moment.

1421
01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:45.987
Robert.

1422
01:54:59.542 --> 01:55:00.509
What are you doing?

1423
01:55:00.584 --> 01:55:02.461
Please.

1424
01:56:22.666 --> 01:56:24.134
I'm sorry.

1425
01:56:34.303 --> 01:56:35.475
I'm sorry.

1426
01:56:38.265 --> 01:56:39.266
No!

1427
01:56:47.817 --> 01:56:49.160
No, Robert!

1428
01:56:49.902 --> 01:56:51.154
No!

1429
01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:53.322
No.

1430
01:56:53.614 --> 01:56:55.833
The map. It's ruined.

1431
01:57:03.332 --> 01:57:04.754
The map is ruined.

1432
01:57:04.834 --> 01:57:07.132
The Grail.

1433
01:57:07.628 --> 01:57:08.754
It's lost.

1434
01:57:09.463 --> 01:57:10.931
The Grail is gone.

1435
01:57:11.298 --> 01:57:14.017
Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh.

1436
01:57:15.136 --> 01:57:16.683
You taught me that.

1437
01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:21.437
Armed police!

1438
01:57:21.517 --> 01:57:23.019
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1439
01:57:24.186 --> 01:57:25.233
Put the gun down.

1440
01:57:28.315 --> 01:57:30.659
Put the gun down.

1441
01:57:35.406 --> 01:57:38.376
That one. The old man.

1442
01:57:38.451 --> 01:57:39.452
You're under arrest!

1443
01:57:39.535 --> 01:57:41.913
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense

1444
01:57:41.996 --> 01:57:43.998
if you do not mention, when questioned

1445
01:57:44.081 --> 01:57:46.209
something which you
later rely on in court.

1446
01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:49.011
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1447
01:57:59.638 --> 01:58:01.936
I'll have some questions for you.

1448
01:58:19.575 --> 01:58:21.623
Robert! Robert!

1449
01:58:21.702 --> 01:58:23.545
Robert! How could you do it?

1450
01:58:23.621 --> 01:58:25.498
How could you? Robert!

1451
01:58:26.165 --> 01:58:28.509
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1452
01:58:28.876 --> 01:58:32.471
To deny every pilgrim the chance to
kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1453
01:58:32.546 --> 01:58:33.547
How could you?

1454
01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:40.228
You couldn't! You solved it.

1455
01:58:42.681 --> 01:58:46.481
You took the scroll out before it broke!

1456
01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.813
You solved it. Oh,
you'll find it, Robert.

1457
01:58:48.896 --> 01:58:50.523
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1458
01:58:50.606 --> 01:58:52.859
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her,

1459
01:58:52.942 --> 01:58:55.036
and you'll set her free upon the world!

1460
01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:58.239
That man there, he's got
the map to the Holy Grail!

1461
01:59:09.124 --> 01:59:13.630
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one.

1462
01:59:14.922 --> 01:59:17.266
The orb which fell from the heavens

1463
01:59:17.341 --> 01:59:19.014
and inspired Newton's life's work.

1464
01:59:19.093 --> 01:59:24.190
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1465
01:59:27.476 --> 01:59:28.944
A-P-P-L-E.

1466
01:59:29.979 --> 01:59:31.196
Apple.

1467
01:59:45.828 --> 01:59:48.923
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1468
01:59:48.998 --> 01:59:51.376
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates

1469
01:59:51.458 --> 01:59:53.426
"Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies

1470
01:59:53.502 --> 01:59:57.257
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies"

1471
01:59:59.341 --> 02:00:01.309
I think I know where she's gone.

1472
02:00:02.177 --> 02:00:04.680
I think the Grail has gone home.

1473
02:00:24.575 --> 02:00:27.078
Built by the Templars themselves.

1474
02:00:27.161 --> 02:00:29.505
Named for the original Rose Line.

1475
02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:31.457
Rosslyn Chapel.

1476
02:00:32.625 --> 02:00:34.377
So this is it.

1477
02:00:35.377 --> 02:00:37.254
The gift at the end.

1478
02:00:38.213 --> 02:00:41.968
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1479
02:00:42.885 --> 02:00:45.684
You never told me the
joke Saunière made of you.

1480
02:00:46.388 --> 02:00:48.061
What was it?

1481
02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.359
He called me a flatfoot.

1482
02:00:50.434 --> 02:00:52.357
A beat cop of history.

1483
02:00:53.437 --> 02:00:55.064
A dumb policeman,

1484
02:00:55.731 --> 02:00:59.235
who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1485
02:00:59.318 --> 02:01:01.036
You know, his father was one.

1486
02:01:01.737 --> 02:01:03.660
A policeman.

1487
02:01:03.739 --> 02:01:08.461
Saunière said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1488
02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:15.005
We are who we protect, I think.

1489
02:01:15.876 --> 02:01:17.594
What we stand up for.

1490
02:01:29.598 --> 02:01:30.975
Jewish.

1491
02:01:32.101 --> 02:01:34.820
Christian, Egyptian.

1492
02:01:36.105 --> 02:01:38.528
Masonic, pagan.

1493
02:01:39.608 --> 02:01:41.326
Templar crosses.

1494
02:01:41.944 --> 02:01:43.321
Pyramids.

1495
02:01:44.071 --> 02:01:47.951
I think I've been here before.

1496
02:01:48.033 --> 02:01:49.250
Sophie?

1497
02:02:09.054 --> 02:02:10.772
A very long time ago.

1498
02:02:13.142 --> 02:02:14.985
Come along, Sophie.

1499
02:02:30.159 --> 02:02:31.206
Sophie.

1500
02:02:32.244 --> 02:02:33.370
Over here.

1501
02:02:39.501 --> 02:02:40.593
Oh.

1502
02:02:41.128 --> 02:02:44.678
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates."

1503
02:02:45.174 --> 02:02:47.677
Pagan symbols for male and female.

1504
02:02:49.511 --> 02:02:51.639
Fused as one.

1505
02:02:51.722 --> 02:02:53.850
As the pagans would have wanted.

1506
02:02:55.601 --> 02:02:57.319
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1507
02:03:03.567 --> 02:03:05.911
We're just gonna be a moment.

1508
02:03:20.751 --> 02:03:22.048
Robert.

1509
02:03:48.153 --> 02:03:51.327
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1510
02:03:51.406 --> 02:03:56.833
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1511
02:04:16.431 --> 02:04:18.104
The fleur-de-lis.

1512
02:05:09.192 --> 02:05:10.284
She was here.

1513
02:05:13.322 --> 02:05:14.869
Her sarcophagus.

1514
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:18.543
Mary Magdalene.

1515
02:05:20.329 --> 02:05:22.252
The Holy Grail herself.

1516
02:05:23.916 --> 02:05:25.543
She was here.

1517
02:05:25.626 --> 02:05:27.253
Where did she go?

1518
02:05:28.337 --> 02:05:30.715
Did the Church finally get her?

1519
02:05:45.228 --> 02:05:47.947
This is incredible. Look at this.

1520
02:05:48.023 --> 02:05:51.368
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1521
02:05:52.527 --> 02:05:55.030
They date back to the death of Christ.

1522
02:05:57.699 --> 02:06:01.044
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1523
02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:26.980
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1524
02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:31.154
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1525
02:06:31.525 --> 02:06:33.903
When you and your grandfather fought,

1526
02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:36.705
was it something about your past?

1527
02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:40.409
How could you know that?

1528
02:06:41.076 --> 02:06:43.795
About how your parents died?

1529
02:06:44.871 --> 02:06:46.418
Sophie?

1530
02:06:48.792 --> 02:06:51.045
It was during primary school.

1531
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:54.631
I was in his library.

1532
02:06:56.425 --> 02:06:58.098
Doing research.

1533
02:06:58.176 --> 02:07:00.804
I was trying to find out about my family.

1534
02:07:00.971 --> 02:07:03.269
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1535
02:07:04.057 --> 02:07:06.355
I wanted to know about them.

1536
02:07:07.144 --> 02:07:09.112
But I couldn't find any records.

1537
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:12.107
Not of their death,

1538
02:07:13.608 --> 02:07:15.360
not of the accident.

1539
02:07:16.319 --> 02:07:18.822
I'd asked him for as
long as I could remember,

1540
02:07:18.905 --> 02:07:20.077
but he would never tell me.

1541
02:07:20.157 --> 02:07:21.875
I told you, no.

1542
02:07:24.286 --> 02:07:25.788
But why can't I?

1543
02:07:26.121 --> 02:07:27.964
He stood over me,

1544
02:07:29.666 --> 02:07:31.714
and he wouldn't let me leave.

1545
02:07:31.918 --> 02:07:33.761
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1546
02:07:34.254 --> 02:07:35.927
Never look for them, Sophie.

1547
02:07:36.173 --> 02:07:37.390
Promise me.

1548
02:07:38.842 --> 02:07:39.968
Swear it!

1549
02:07:40.677 --> 02:07:41.803
Swear it to me!

1550
02:07:52.481 --> 02:07:54.449
I kept my promise.

1551
02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:00.368
The next week he sent
me to boarding school.

1552
02:08:02.574 --> 02:08:05.544
One weekend, I came home unexpectedly.

1553
02:08:07.162 --> 02:08:09.256
And what I saw my grandfather doing...

1554
02:08:10.874 --> 02:08:12.501
Some ritual.

1555
02:08:14.503 --> 02:08:16.096
I was so frightened.

1556
02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:22.932
We hardly ever spoke again.

1557
02:08:26.556 --> 02:08:28.183
Do you have any...

1558
02:08:28.975 --> 02:08:31.694
Any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1559
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:34.523
Before your parents were killed?

1560
02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:38.193
Yeah. No, I don't know.

1561
02:08:39.361 --> 02:08:40.533
Why?

1562
02:08:43.281 --> 02:08:45.659
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1563
02:09:05.137 --> 02:09:06.855
These are my parents.

1564
02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:10.484
My brother.

1565
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:14.108
And this is you, isn't it?

1566
02:09:19.067 --> 02:09:22.742
The paper says the
entire family was killed.

1567
02:09:23.238 --> 02:09:26.583
The mother, the father, the boy, six.

1568
02:09:28.827 --> 02:09:31.046
And the girl, four.

1569
02:09:32.747 --> 02:09:35.842
But your name was never Saunière.

1570
02:09:35.917 --> 02:09:37.464
It's Saint-Clair.

1571
02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:43.183
It's one of the oldest
families in France.

1572
02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:47.096
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1573
02:09:56.188 --> 02:09:57.986
Royal blood.

1574
02:10:00.025 --> 02:10:01.618
I was so wrong.

1575
02:10:03.278 --> 02:10:07.579
Saunière didn't want you to help
guard the secret of the Holy Grail.

1576
02:10:09.284 --> 02:10:10.627
Sophie,

1577
02:10:13.121 --> 02:10:14.964
you are the secret.

1578
02:10:16.625 --> 02:10:18.548
You survived the accident.

1579
02:10:19.377 --> 02:10:22.130
If it even was an accident.

1580
02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:24.137
The Priory found out.

1581
02:10:24.799 --> 02:10:27.973
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1582
02:10:28.511 --> 02:10:31.481
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself,

1583
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:34.358
who raised you as his own.

1584
02:10:35.644 --> 02:10:37.442
According to all of this,

1585
02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:40.649
Princess Sophie...

1586
02:10:44.361 --> 02:10:45.988
...you are the heir.

1587
02:10:48.031 --> 02:10:50.125
The end of the bloodline.

1588
02:10:51.701 --> 02:10:54.750
You are the last living descendent

1589
02:10:56.081 --> 02:10:57.924
of Jesus Christ.

1590
02:11:43.461 --> 02:11:44.838
What is this?

1591
02:11:46.881 --> 02:11:48.098
Sophie?

1592
02:11:51.344 --> 02:11:52.470
Who are you?

1593
02:11:52.554 --> 02:11:55.524
There have been many names.

1594
02:11:55.598 --> 02:11:57.225
The keepers.

1595
02:11:58.268 --> 02:12:00.066
Guardians.

1596
02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:02.694
The Priory of Sion.

1597
02:12:02.772 --> 02:12:07.824
But to you, Sophie, we are
friends of the man who raised you,

1598
02:12:08.486 --> 02:12:10.079
Jacques Saunière.

1599
02:12:12.490 --> 02:12:15.209
He would have wanted you to know

1600
02:12:15.285 --> 02:12:17.788
that he loved you very much.

1601
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:22.926
And that the Priory are
here to protect you now

1602
02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:26.175
as they have always protected our family.

1603
02:12:28.757 --> 02:12:30.851
I gave you up once

1604
02:12:31.634 --> 02:12:34.433
knowing I might never see you again.

1605
02:12:38.141 --> 02:12:40.064
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1606
02:12:41.186 --> 02:12:44.611
I have prayed for this moment

1607
02:12:44.689 --> 02:12:46.566
for a very long time.

1608
02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:50.321
Welcome home, child.

1609
02:13:03.166 --> 02:13:04.383
Hey.

1610
02:13:14.719 --> 02:13:18.565
She has some things she wants to tell me.

1611
02:13:19.557 --> 02:13:21.935
About my family.

1612
02:13:28.441 --> 02:13:29.658
What will you do?

1613
02:13:30.819 --> 02:13:34.323
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1614
02:13:35.156 --> 02:13:37.659
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1615
02:13:41.079 --> 02:13:42.706
She said when Saunière died

1616
02:13:42.789 --> 02:13:45.588
he took the location of
Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1617
02:13:45.667 --> 02:13:50.298
So there's no way to empirically
prove that I am related to her.

1618
02:13:53.049 --> 02:13:55.017
What would you do, Robert?

1619
02:13:55.969 --> 02:13:58.188
Okay, maybe there is no proof.

1620
02:13:58.263 --> 02:14:00.436
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1621
02:14:00.515 --> 02:14:04.236
But, Sophie, the only thing
that matters is what you believe.

1622
02:14:05.645 --> 02:14:08.774
History shows us Jesus
was an extraordinary man.

1623
02:14:08.857 --> 02:14:10.859
A human inspiration. That's it.

1624
02:14:11.734 --> 02:14:14.453
That's all the evidence has ever proved.

1625
02:14:15.905 --> 02:14:17.031
But...

1626
02:14:17.991 --> 02:14:19.868
When I was a boy...

1627
02:14:22.203 --> 02:14:26.083
When I was down in that
well Teabing told you about,

1628
02:14:29.419 --> 02:14:31.888
I thought I was going to die, Sophie.

1629
02:14:34.007 --> 02:14:36.135
What I did,

1630
02:14:36.217 --> 02:14:37.594
I prayed.

1631
02:14:38.928 --> 02:14:40.521
I prayed

1632
02:14:40.597 --> 02:14:43.567
to Jesus to keep me alive,

1633
02:14:43.641 --> 02:14:45.188
so I could see my parents again,

1634
02:14:45.268 --> 02:14:47.362
so I could go to school again,

1635
02:14:48.396 --> 02:14:50.649
so I could play with my dog.

1636
02:14:52.025 --> 02:14:55.029
Sometimes I wonder if I
wasn't alone down there.

1637
02:14:57.238 --> 02:15:00.082
Why does it have to be human or divine?

1638
02:15:00.158 --> 02:15:02.081
Maybe human is divine.

1639
02:15:03.369 --> 02:15:05.042
Why couldn't Jesus have been a father

1640
02:15:05.121 --> 02:15:07.920
and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1641
02:15:08.583 --> 02:15:11.382
Like turning water into wine?

1642
02:15:11.461 --> 02:15:14.590
Well, who knows? His blood is your blood.

1643
02:15:15.423 --> 02:15:18.518
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1644
02:15:19.093 --> 02:15:22.222
Maybe you healed my
phobia with your hands.

1645
02:15:22.305 --> 02:15:25.309
And maybe you're a
knight on a Grail quest.

1646
02:15:28.144 --> 02:15:30.693
Well, here's the question.

1647
02:15:31.564 --> 02:15:34.283
A living descendent of Jesus Christ,

1648
02:15:35.818 --> 02:15:38.367
would she destroy faith?

1649
02:15:38.905 --> 02:15:41.784
Or would she renew it?

1650
02:15:44.452 --> 02:15:47.626
So again I say, what
matters is what you believe.

1651
02:15:49.958 --> 02:15:51.255
Thank you.

1652
02:15:53.419 --> 02:15:54.636
For bringing me here.

1653
02:15:56.673 --> 02:15:59.176
For letting him choose you,

1654
02:16:00.051 --> 02:16:01.268
Sir Robert.

1655
02:16:11.521 --> 02:16:12.522
You take care.

1656
02:16:14.107 --> 02:16:15.233
Yes.

1657
02:16:39.841 --> 02:16:41.013
Hey.

1658
02:16:54.022 --> 02:16:55.023
Nope.

1659
02:16:56.357 --> 02:16:58.610
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1660
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:03.407
Godspeed.

1661
02:18:02.256 --> 02:18:04.099
Bloodline.

1662
02:18:07.095 --> 02:18:08.438
Rose Line.

1663
02:18:15.228 --> 02:18:17.276
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1664
02:19:08.823 --> 02:19:12.418
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1665
02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:19.005
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, She lies.

1666
02:19:35.141 --> 02:19:38.771
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er Her gates.

1667
02:20:18.226 --> 02:20:21.730
"She rests at last beneath starry skies."
