1
00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:45.583
My God, forgive me.

2
00:06:34.312 --> 00:06:38.649
Teacher, all four are dead.

3
00:06:39.484 --> 00:06:42.570
The sénéchaux and the
Grand Master himself.

4
00:06:42.737 --> 00:06:45.823
Then I assume
you have the location.

5
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.118
Confirmed by all.

6
00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:51.704
Independently.

7
00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:56.834
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

8
00:07:00.338 --> 00:07:04.467
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

9
00:07:07.887 --> 00:07:10.306
It is here.

10
00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:13.017
In Paris, Teacher.

11
00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:19.398
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

12
00:07:19.899 --> 00:07:22.652
You will go forth, Silas.

13
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.103
I chastise my body.

14
00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:41.512
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

15
00:12:41.846 --> 00:12:43.722
It hides beneath the Rose.

16
00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:47.059
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

17
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:50.688
I meet the council in an hour.

18
00:12:50.938 --> 00:12:54.692
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

19
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.056
Precisely.

20
00:14:07.765 --> 00:14:09.391
Precisely.

21
00:14:12.144 --> 00:14:14.230
Officer Neveu.

22
00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.024
This is not the time.

23
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:19.443
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

24
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.445
...and I've deciphered the code.

25
00:14:21.779 --> 00:14:23.364
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

26
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:24.990
That's the code Saunière
left on the floor.

27
00:14:26.283 --> 00:14:28.410
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

28
00:14:30.037 --> 00:14:31.372
The numbers are out of order.

29
00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:09.994
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

30
00:15:55.956 --> 00:15:57.499
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

31
00:15:57.708 --> 00:15:59.376
Good evening, Sister.

32
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:04.173
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

33
00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:06.008
Of course, Father.

34
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.218
But so late?

35
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.471
Wouldn't tomorrow...?

36
00:16:10.638 --> 00:16:15.392
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

37
00:16:16.101 --> 00:16:18.562
It would be my pleasure.

38
00:18:28.275 --> 00:18:31.028
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

39
00:20:15.799 --> 00:20:18.635
Saunière was reading his book.

40
00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:21.013
"Blood trail."

41
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:24.850
Excuse me, captain.

42
00:20:25.142 --> 00:20:27.102
We have a problem.

43
00:20:27.311 --> 00:20:30.314
Headquarters didn't send
Sophie Neveu.

44
00:20:32.524 --> 00:20:33.734
What?

45
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:37.321
Captain, look at this.

46
00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:40.157
He jumped!

47
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.825
Shit.

48
00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:47.164
He's moving again. And fast.

49
00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:49.917
He must be in a car.

50
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:55.297
He's going south
on Pont Du Carrousel.

51
00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.307
Bastard.

52
00:24:22.754 --> 00:24:27.717
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

53
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:29.678
Smart to hit the truck.

54
00:24:30.053 --> 00:24:33.598
What, you admire him now?

55
00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:37.310
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

56
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:40.230
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

57
00:29:10.667 --> 00:29:12.961
Christ, give me strength.

58
00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:29.519
You are a ghost.

59
00:29:30.854 --> 00:29:33.148
Christ, give me strength.

60
00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:13.062
Stealing in a house of God!

61
00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:28.411
You are an angel.

62
00:30:30.663 --> 00:30:32.916
Christ, give me strength.

63
00:32:15.351 --> 00:32:20.857
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

64
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:26.529
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdon's credit card.

65
00:32:26.738 --> 00:32:28.197
A decoy, I'm sure.

66
00:32:28.406 --> 00:32:30.867
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

67
00:32:31.075 --> 00:32:33.703
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

68
00:32:33.953 --> 00:32:36.748
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

69
00:32:37.081 --> 00:32:40.877
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

70
00:32:41.044 --> 00:32:44.005
Robert Langdon is guilty.

71
00:33:52.115 --> 00:33:53.449
Police.

72
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:56.285
What do you want?

73
00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.918
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

74
00:34:06.129 --> 00:34:08.297
Go and get something to eat.

75
00:38:03.449 --> 00:38:05.034
This is Jacques Saunière.

76
00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:08.245
Please leave a message
after the tone.

77
00:38:08.955 --> 00:38:11.332
Please, Monsieur Saunière,
pick up the phone.

78
00:38:11.582 --> 00:38:13.084
This is Sandrine Bieil.

79
00:38:13.334 --> 00:38:15.586
I have called the list.

80
00:38:16.003 --> 00:38:17.922
I fear the other guardians are dead.

81
00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:20.424
The lie has been told.

82
00:38:20.758 --> 00:38:22.677
The floor panel has been broken.

83
00:38:23.344 --> 00:38:26.764
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

84
00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:30.077
Come, you saints of God.

85
00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:33.622
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

86
00:39:34.373 --> 00:39:37.126
To receive her soul.

87
00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:42.131
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

88
00:41:27.111 --> 00:41:29.697
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

89
00:41:29.864 --> 00:41:32.074
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

90
00:42:15.993 --> 00:42:17.786
How may I help you?

91
00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:25.961
The door to the right, please.

92
00:42:44.438 --> 00:42:47.107
Good evening. I am André Vernet,
the night manager.

93
00:42:48.609 --> 00:42:51.862
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

94
00:46:36.795 --> 00:46:39.423
Good evening, sir. Police.

95
00:46:39.882 --> 00:46:43.969
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

96
00:48:04.341 --> 00:48:08.053
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

97
00:48:08.262 --> 00:48:13.058
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

98
00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.351
Amen.

99
00:50:54.386 --> 00:50:56.263
Feeling better, Sophie?

100
00:55:05.261 --> 00:55:08.098
It seems you're not a driver at all.

101
00:55:09.933 --> 00:55:14.729
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

102
00:55:15.397 --> 00:55:18.066
You think you're in pain now,
André Vernet?

103
00:55:18.483 --> 00:55:22.487
My cause is worth your life.
Understand?

104
00:55:26.825 --> 00:55:28.410
What do you want?

105
00:55:28.743 --> 00:55:33.999
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

106
00:57:02.087 --> 00:57:04.714
The truck's signal is coming online.

107
00:57:04.923 --> 00:57:06.341
It's about time.

108
00:57:10.095 --> 00:57:11.721
Locked on and tracking, sir.

109
00:57:14.557 --> 00:57:17.977
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

110
00:57:19.562 --> 00:57:23.024
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Château Villette.

111
00:57:23.942 --> 00:57:27.278
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

112
00:58:50.653 --> 00:58:54.490
It's an honor to welcome you...

113
00:58:55.116 --> 00:58:57.202
...even though it's late.

114
00:59:37.533 --> 00:59:39.786
Château Villette. Yes.

115
01:15:19.433 --> 01:15:21.101
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

116
01:15:21.351 --> 01:15:25.439
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

117
01:18:13.648 --> 01:18:16.068
Rip the gate down.

118
01:20:01.381 --> 01:20:02.716
Shit.

119
01:22:07.299 --> 01:22:09.843
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

120
01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:13.430
You're the one who lost them.

121
01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:15.181
You control every step
of this investigation.

122
01:22:15.348 --> 01:22:17.934
You don't let anybody breathe.

123
01:22:18.435 --> 01:22:21.146
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

124
01:22:24.524 --> 01:22:27.360
What is it with these two birds?

125
01:22:31.448 --> 01:22:34.326
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

126
01:22:35.201 --> 01:22:38.455
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

127
01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:42.680
I need the flight plan.

128
01:25:42.972 --> 01:25:44.015
Ten minutes.

129
01:25:44.974 --> 01:25:47.352
I asked you to get it for me.

130
01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:50.396
I'm on break.

131
01:25:51.856 --> 01:25:53.441
Come back in 10 minutes.

132
01:25:55.443 --> 01:25:57.612
My nose! My nose!

133
01:25:58.196 --> 01:25:59.614
The flight plan, please.

134
01:25:59.781 --> 01:26:00.782
You asshole!

135
01:29:35.621 --> 01:29:39.751
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

136
01:29:39.917 --> 01:29:45.048
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

137
01:29:45.298 --> 01:29:47.508
No extradition.

138
01:29:50.261 --> 01:29:56.559
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

139
01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:03.733
What's going on, Bezu?

140
01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:09.614
You know that I am Opus Dei?

141
01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.532
Yes.

142
01:30:16.829 --> 01:30:20.333
A bishop of my order called me.

143
01:30:20.666 --> 01:30:22.794
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

144
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.713
His name was Robert Langdon.

145
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:30.009
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this man's heart.

146
01:30:30.176 --> 01:30:32.929
That he would keep killing.

147
01:30:33.304 --> 01:30:35.765
He said I had to stop him.

148
01:30:37.809 --> 01:30:41.646
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

149
01:30:41.813 --> 01:30:45.233
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

150
01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:52.949
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

151
01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:55.535
The bishop?

152
01:30:56.869 --> 01:30:58.955
God himself?

153
01:31:07.588 --> 01:31:10.716
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

154
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:45.056
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

155
01:34:45.264 --> 01:34:46.515
Yes, I do, Teacher.

156
01:34:46.682 --> 01:34:50.019
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

157
01:34:50.186 --> 01:34:51.645
I am honored.

158
01:34:51.896 --> 01:34:56.734
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

159
01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.400
I understand.

160
01:50:05.433 --> 01:50:07.519
I am a ghost.

161
02:02:12.243 --> 02:02:14.078
Come along, Sophie.

162
02:07:00.072 --> 02:07:02.366
Sophie, where are you, princess?

163
02:07:19.258 --> 02:07:20.968
I told you, no.

164
02:07:23.387 --> 02:07:24.888
But why can't I?

165
02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.855
They're dead. Dead and buried.

166
02:07:33.355 --> 02:07:35.024
Never look for them, Sophie.

167
02:07:35.274 --> 02:07:36.483
Promise me.

168
02:07:37.943 --> 02:07:39.069
Swear it!

169
02:07:39.778 --> 02:07:40.904
Swear it to me!
