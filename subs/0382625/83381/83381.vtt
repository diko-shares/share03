Does anyone know
why you do anything?

You two didn't date, did you?

172

Me and Old Man Wilkie?
Gross.

173
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,793
Well, somebody must know why!

174
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:28,230
See if you can also find out
why I married you.

175
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,200
- Hey, Lacey, is Wanda here?
- No.

176
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,203
Good. I mean, not that I care.
I'm not scared of her.

177
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,071
Because of my bravery.

178
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:40,509
Anyway, I'm here to report
I've solved your graffiti mystery.

179
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,544
It's Emma.
She's doing it right now.

180
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,578
Emma's not the problem,
she's the solution.

181
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,213
She's painting over it.

182
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,850
- With more graffiti?
- What?

183
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,718
[chuckles nervously]

184
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:56,124
I'm still not done.
You can't judge it until I'm done.

185
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,293

You gotta go.

You want to play with the ball?
Go get the ball!

00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:15,209
How about a shoelace?
Cats like stringy stuff, right?

191

Go get it!

You want to play peekaboo?

- Okay, start it up, but go slowly.

Yeah, that was my first one.
I don't much care for it.

Well, it's all downhill from here.

Boy, that really works
out the old biceps.

216

Are those in your legs?
Because that's where I'm feeling it.

You know what's weird?

218
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,326
We have two biceps, which I get,

219
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:33,795
so shouldn't we have
three triceps?

You said you were going to fix it.

234
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,508
And I did. You said the
graffiti was offensive.

- Well, it's not offensive anymore.
- [scoffing] Ha!

help, but on one condition.
