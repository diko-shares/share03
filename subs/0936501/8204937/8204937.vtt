00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.647
I need an agent to follow someone.

3
00:41:20.819 --> 00:41:23.295
Little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf,


3
00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:25.999
"Grand-ma! What big arms you have!"

4
00:41:27.075 --> 00:41:29.800
- The wolf replied, "It's so ..."
- Jean-Claude, it's your assistant.

5
00:41:35.205 --> 00:41:35.722
Yes?

5
00:41:35.922 --> 00:41:38.300
He visited a branch of Interim and rented a car.

6
00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:39.262
That's all?


6
00:41:39.762 --> 00:41:41.038
Yes. Things are quiet.

7
00:41:41.798 --> 00:41:43.955
Don't be fooled.
With him it does not take long. 


8
00:46:17.954 --> 00:46:20.211
- It's sorted.
- Really?

9
00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.288
- Are you busy tonight?
- Of course.


10
00:48:35.523 --> 00:48:36.140
Lets go!

11
00:51:27.314 --> 00:51:28.892
I told you he wouldn't stay quiet for long.

12
00:51:29.232 --> 00:51:30.111
OK. So what do we do now?

13
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:33.147
Now that he's started this mess
it wont be long before you're finished!


14
00:51:51.287 --> 00:51:51.927
Oh shit!

15
00:54:40.381 --> 00:54:42.619
It's good. We've got his cell phone's signal.

16
00:54:43.576 --> 00:54:44.614
Narrowing down his location.

16
00:54:44.976 --> 00:54:46.214
He's very close.

16
00:54:57.576 --> 00:54:58.014
Got him!



17
00:55:51.823 --> 00:55:53.221
Are you with him?

18
00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:54.719
Negative.

28
01:00:58.146 --> 01:00:59.105
Give me the tin.


34
01:07:16.714 --> 01:07:17.836
I'm home.

35
01:07:19.053 --> 01:07:20.231
Good evening my dears.


36
01:07:22.701 --> 01:07:24.775
The children should be in bed.

37
01:07:41.838 --> 01:07:43.575
Children, bed time.

38
01:07:43.576 --> 01:07:45.654
It's late. Come on.

39
01:07:51.908 --> 01:07:53.988
Good night.

40
01:09:26.476 --> 01:09:27.612
Shut up!




41
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:37.570
There is still time to bid,
we have one more left.

42
01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:39.654
We'll see her in a moment.

43
01:21:01.964 --> 01:21:03.923
It's ready.

44
01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:07.544
You, take the girls.

45
01:22:07.545 --> 01:22:09.903
You, come with me.

46
01:22:10.044 --> 01:22:12.711
Intruders! Search the boat.

47
01:22:50.376 --> 01:22:51.759
Where are you?

48
01:22:53.792 --> 01:22:55.375
Why aren't you answering?

49
01:23:21.374 --> 01:23:23.008
Get inside!

50
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.166
What's the problem?

51
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.499
The girls father has arrived.

52
01:23:27.541 --> 01:23:28.499
Leave it to me.
