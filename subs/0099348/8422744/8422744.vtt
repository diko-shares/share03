1
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.652
- This is the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:35.338
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.390
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.050
You there!
Is this the last one?

5
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.375
Oh, God, what a mess.

6
00:01:50.685 --> 00:01:52.550
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.270
But there will be
if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.217
Well, I can't saw
if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:01.137
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.449
Let's coffee up.
He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.690
Oh, God!

12
00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:41.304


13
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.400
St. David's field - Tennessee
1863

14
00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:48.944
Glass.

15
00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:52.790
is that Tucker's men?

16
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.450
Yes, sir.
I think it is.

17
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.494
How long has it been like this?

18
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:58.337
We just found them
this morning, sir.

19
00:04:58.337 --> 00:05:00.272
They've been here for two days.

20
00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:12.468
Is that you, lieutenant?

21
00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.618
Sons of bitches.

22
00:05:20.862 --> 00:05:24.046
Come on. You better take cover.

23
00:05:25.275 --> 00:05:28.893
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

24
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.527
There you go.

25
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.286
You went to the hospital?

26
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.623
It was no good.

27
00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:48.086
What's going on here?

28
00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:50.271
What's going on here?

29
00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:52.883
That seems to be
the question, all right.

30
00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:56.495
See, you could ask the major.

31
00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:59.940
But he don't know.
He's busy.

32
00:06:00.101 --> 00:06:02.834
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers' mess

33
00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:04.728
run out of peach ice cream.

34
00:06:05.774 --> 00:06:07.856
Then, of course,
you got the general.

35
00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.158
He come up to see the show.

36
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.402
All he knows is
there ain't no show.

37
00:06:12.597 --> 00:06:15.322
Which ain't entirely correct, see,
because we started a balloon up,

38
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:18.125
but they shot her down
before we got 10 feet off the ground.

39
00:06:18.225 --> 00:06:21.995
Nobody's made a run either way.
It's been a stand-off all damn day.

40
00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:26.625
Now, the major,
he's looking at the general.

41
00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:30.679
He's thinking to himself,
"I better do something."

42
00:06:31.424 --> 00:06:32.848
You know what that means.

43
00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:36.092
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

44
00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:39.137
They're supposed to be
beat up just like us.

45
00:06:39.874 --> 00:06:42.932
Hell, everybody knows
Tucker's men are tough as cobs.

46
00:06:43.795 --> 00:06:47.562
So far, the only thing been killed
out here is three milking cows.

47
00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:50.648
Course, that's about to change.

48
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.947
You son of a bitch.

49
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.494
You know, some of the boys are saying,
if we ain't gonna fight,

50
00:07:04.374 --> 00:07:07.123
we could just settle this
whole business with a little

51
00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:08.875
high-stakes poker.

52
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.543
Wouldn't that be a sight?

53
00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:13.187
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field,

54
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.949
drawing cards.

55
00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:26.309
Soldier: What is it, sir?

56
00:07:26.963 --> 00:07:28.453
Looks like a suicide.

57
00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:30.104
Tucker!

58
00:07:42.804 --> 00:07:44.202
What's he doing?

59
00:08:05.435 --> 00:08:06.832
Soldier: Over here!

60
00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:12.738
What did you say to him?

61
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:14.715
I didn't say nothing.

62
00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:21.030
You son of a bitch!

63
00:08:38.576 --> 00:08:40.487
Come on back,
you son of a bitch!

64
00:08:40.578 --> 00:08:41.867
Come on back!

65
00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:44.937
- Come on back!
- You won't make it no second time!

66
00:08:44.937 --> 00:08:46.159
All right by me.

67
00:08:47.335 --> 00:08:48.665
Yeah!

68
00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:51.143
Forgive me, father.

69
00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:56.458
He's coming back again!

70
00:08:56.594 --> 00:08:58.133
Here he comes, boys!

71
00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:34.820
- Ready!
- I got him.

72
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:22.109
Don't-- Don't--

73
00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:24.487
Don't take off my foot.

74
00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:27.381
You rest easy, son.
You'll keep your foot.

75
00:11:27.712 --> 00:11:30.426
As god is my judge,
you'll keep it.

76
00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.941
Bring up my ambulance.

77
00:11:36.941 --> 00:11:38.084
Sir?

78
00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:41.186
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

79
00:11:42.593 --> 00:11:45.607
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

80
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:15.813
<i>"The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.</i>

81
00:12:15.913 --> 00:12:17.425
<i>“In trying to produce
my own death,</i>

82
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.459
<i>"l was elevated to the
status of a living hero.</i>

83
00:12:20.659 --> 00:12:22.363
<i>"I was also awarded Cisco,</i>

84
00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:25.489
<i>“the trusty mount that carried me
across the field that day.</i>

85
00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:29.276
<i>"And on full recovery, was given
transfer to any station I desired.</i>

86
00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:33.288
<i>"The bloody slaughter continues
in the east as I arrive at Fort Hayes,</i>

87
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.123
<i>"a tiny island of men and material</i>

88
00:12:35.123 --> 00:12:37.909
<i>"surrounded by
a never-ending sea of prairie."</i>

89
00:13:20.202 --> 00:13:22.437
Well, it's not easy
to raise my own foot, too.

90
00:13:22.461 --> 00:13:24.881


91
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.809
Hey, bill.

92
00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:37.660
- Lieutenant.
- Lieutenant.

93
00:13:42.933 --> 00:13:44.317


94
00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:01.325
Where can I find major Fambrough?

95
00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:03.452
All the way down
the end of the hall.

96
00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:04.729
Thank you.

97
00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:16.532
"Lieutenant John J. Dunbar."

98
00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:23.055
Lieutenant John J. Dunbar?

99
00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:25.975
- Yes, sir.
- "Yes, sir."

100
00:14:27.008 --> 00:14:28.727
Indian fighter, huh?

101
00:14:29.844 --> 00:14:30.959
Excuse me?

102
00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:33.490
Well, it says here that you're to
be posted on the frontier.

103
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:34.821
The frontier is Indian country.

104
00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:37.528
I quickly deduced that
you're an Indian fighter.

105
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.155
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

106
00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:42.324
- No, sir.
- "No, sir."

107
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:50.549
It says here that
you've been decorated.

108
00:14:50.573 --> 00:14:51.900
Yes, sir.

109
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.588
And they sent you here
to be posted?

110
00:14:56.671 --> 00:14:59.174
Actually, sir,
I'm here at my own request.

111
00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.927
Really? Why?

112
00:15:02.376 --> 00:15:04.721
I've always wanted
to see the frontier.

113
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:07.641
You want to see the frontier?

114
00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:11.144
Yes, sir.
Before it's gone.

115
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.278
Such a smart lad,
coming straight to me.

116
00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:30.397
Sir... knight,

117
00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:34.063
I am sending you
on a knight's errand.

118
00:15:35.576 --> 00:15:37.738
You will report to captain cargill

119
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.132
at the furthermost
outpost of the realm,

120
00:15:41.249 --> 00:15:42.717
Fort Sedgewick.

121
00:15:44.919 --> 00:15:48.431
My personal seal
will assure your safety

122
00:15:48.464 --> 00:15:51.685
through the many miles
of wild and hostile country.

123
00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:03.697
- I was wondering--
- Yes?

124
00:16:04.647 --> 00:16:07.117
I was wondering, sir,
how will I be getting there?

125
00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:10.495
You think I don't know?

126
00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:12.731
- No, sir.
- You think I don't know.

127
00:16:12.822 --> 00:16:14.783
- It's just that I don't know--
- Hold your tongue.

128
00:16:14.883 --> 00:16:17.402
I happen to be in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

129
00:16:17.493 --> 00:16:19.337
See that peasant out there?

130
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:21.548
He calls himself Timmons.

131
00:16:21.789 --> 00:16:23.517
He's going to your Fort Sedgewick
this very afternoon.

132
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:25.593
You can ride with him if you like.

133
00:16:26.002 --> 00:16:28.554
He knows the way.
Thank you. That is all.

134
00:16:41.809 --> 00:16:43.261
Sir knight?

135
00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:49.367
I've just pissed in my pants,

136
00:16:51.569 --> 00:16:54.063
and nobody can do
anything about it.

137
00:17:08.502 --> 00:17:10.137
To your journey!

138
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:16.769
To my journey!

139
00:17:34.429 --> 00:17:35.579
Haw!

140
00:17:37.907 --> 00:17:39.792
Giddy on a little bit, Jim!

141
00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:42.027
Giddy on a little bit, Jim!

142
00:17:42.787 --> 00:17:44.277
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

143
00:17:44.372 --> 00:17:46.298
I'll have my crown now.

144
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.095
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

145
00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:54.699
- I-I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

146
00:17:54.715 --> 00:17:57.251
I said I'll have my crown, by god!

147
00:17:57.259 --> 00:17:59.603
Now! Now!

148
00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:04.066
- No.
- Sir.

149
00:18:05.393 --> 00:18:07.402
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

150
00:18:08.078 --> 00:18:09.078
No.

151
00:18:12.942 --> 00:18:14.576
Timmons: Come on, little Jim!

152
00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:16.036
Get on up!

153
00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:18.956
Man: Major.

154
00:18:20.116 --> 00:18:21.667
Major?

155
00:18:25.705 --> 00:18:27.255
The king is dead.

156
00:18:32.128 --> 00:18:33.929
Long live the king.

157
00:18:52.648 --> 00:18:53.979
Man: The major!

158
00:18:58.821 --> 00:19:00.105
Get back!

159
00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:03.984


160
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.586
The shot came from inside!

161
00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:19.516
Haw a little bit, Jim and Jake!
Haw a little bit, Jim!

162
00:19:19.675 --> 00:19:21.226
Haw a little bit.

163
00:19:22.052 --> 00:19:24.687
Gee a little bit, Jim!
Gee a little bit, Jim!

164
00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:27.649
Gee a little bit.
Gee on a little bit.

165
00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:06.565
The hell was that?

166
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:09.323
What is that?

167
00:21:15.124 --> 00:21:16.910
What the hell is that?

168
00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:44.659
Why don't you
put that in your book?

169
00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:55.619
<i>“Were it not for my companion,</i>

170
00:21:55.706 --> 00:21:58.423
<i>"I believe I would be having
the time of my life.</i>

171
00:21:58.459 --> 00:21:59.619
<i>"I know he means well,</i>

172
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.261
<i>"but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met.”</i>

173
00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:40.048
How far you make the fort?

174
00:22:40.501 --> 00:22:42.091
Far.

175
00:22:44.797 --> 00:22:46.304
How far?

176
00:22:46.632 --> 00:22:48.623
Forty, fifty miles, maybe.

177
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:51.768
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

178
00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:54.312
It's gonna be my post.

179
00:22:55.683 --> 00:22:56.964
My home.

180
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:04.972
You ain't hard to please,
I'll give you that much.

181
00:23:06.902 --> 00:23:08.993
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh!

182
00:23:10.072 --> 00:23:11.621
Look yonder.

183
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.550
What you got there?

184
00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:39.773
Somebody back east is saying,
"why don't she write?"

185
00:23:41.603 --> 00:23:43.402
You stupid bastard!

186
00:24:59.139 --> 00:25:00.770
Get up, Timmons.

187
00:25:02.392 --> 00:25:03.648
Timmons.

188
00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:05.809
Get up.

189
00:25:19.409 --> 00:25:20.623
Get up.

190
00:25:21.703 --> 00:25:23.084
Come on, Get up.

191
00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:27.989
Get up!

192
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.515
Someone poked me in my butt.
Was that you?

193
00:25:38.178 --> 00:25:39.851
God damn it!

194
00:25:42.057 --> 00:25:43.605
I'm gonna have a welt.

195
00:26:58.508 --> 00:26:59.930
Corporal guest.

196
00:27:06.808 --> 00:27:08.188
Corporal guest.

197
00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:16.321
Corporal guest, you don't have
to talk to me, just please come out.

198
00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:38.719
It's the end.

199
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.139
Assemble the men
in front of my quarters.

200
00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:54.526
You hate me.

201
00:27:56.358 --> 00:27:58.572
But I feel
none of the same for you.

202
00:28:00.821 --> 00:28:02.492
You men stayed.

203
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.414
You stayed after
they took all our horses.

204
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.460
You stayed after
all the others deserted.

205
00:28:14.418 --> 00:28:18.049
You stayed after
the army failed to resupply us.

206
00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:24.347
I have looked for that wagon
from Fort Hayes,

207
00:28:24.594 --> 00:28:26.266
just as you have,

208
00:28:26.555 --> 00:28:28.601
day after miserable day.

209
00:28:31.643 --> 00:28:34.315
And all I can say
is that I'm proud of you.

210
00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:38.862
Now, get your things, men.
We're leaving this place.

211
00:28:40.068 --> 00:28:42.073
The army can go to hell.

212
00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.705
Go. Get your things.

213
00:29:28.575 --> 00:29:31.080
John: How come we haven't
seen any buffalo?

214
00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:34.066
You can't figure
the stinking buffalo.

215
00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:36.955
You can't. Sometimes you
won't see any for days.

216
00:29:37.042 --> 00:29:40.589
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

217
00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:45.088
What about Indians?

218
00:29:45.175 --> 00:29:47.788
Indians?
Goddamn Indians!

219
00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:51.267
You just as soon not see them
unless the bastards are dead.

220
00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:53.853
They're nothing but
thieves and beggars.

221
00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:55.729
Haw, up there!

222
00:31:24.774 --> 00:31:28.446
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

223
00:31:33.008 --> 00:31:34.452
Go down there.

224
00:31:34.801 --> 00:31:37.372
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

225
00:31:38.914 --> 00:31:40.375
Go down there.

226
00:31:43.011 --> 00:31:45.280
Haw! Haw!

227
00:31:45.513 --> 00:31:47.057
Ain't that a son of a bitch!

228
00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:15.685
There ain't nothing here, lieutenant.

229
00:32:17.619 --> 00:32:18.938
Hey!

230
00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:38.307
There ain't nothing here, lieutenant.

231
00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:44.589
Lieutenant!

232
00:32:46.357 --> 00:32:49.026
Everybody's ran off or got killed.

233
00:33:06.918 --> 00:33:09.588
All right.
Let's unload the wagon.

234
00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:13.175
What?
What, and leave it all here?

235
00:33:14.676 --> 00:33:16.303
I'm staying, too.

236
00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:19.056
There ain't nothing here, lieutenant.

237
00:33:19.531 --> 00:33:22.142
No, not at the moment.

238
00:33:22.492 --> 00:33:24.186
We don't know what's happened.

239
00:33:24.477 --> 00:33:26.505
So, so, l--
Things--

240
00:33:26.688 --> 00:33:29.149
Things being as they are,

241
00:33:29.341 --> 00:33:32.027
we might as well just turn around
and get headed back.

242
00:33:32.527 --> 00:33:35.264
- This is my post.
- "This is my post"?

243
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.074
This is my post.

244
00:33:38.717 --> 00:33:40.452
"This is my post"?

245
00:33:40.535 --> 00:33:43.739
Jesus H. Christ.
What, are you crazy, boy?

246
00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:45.165
Lieutenant.

247
00:33:47.575 --> 00:33:49.094
Fast son of a bitch.

248
00:33:50.078 --> 00:33:51.834
- Jesus H. Christ!
- This is my post.

249
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:53.457
All right, put it down.
Put it down.

250
00:33:53.548 --> 00:33:55.308
And these are the
post provisions, all right?

251
00:33:55.383 --> 00:33:57.590
Now, get your ass off the wagon...

252
00:33:57.677 --> 00:33:59.508
- Put it down!
- and help me unload.

253
00:33:59.596 --> 00:34:01.723
We're just having a conversation.
Now put it down.

254
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.151
I'll let them know where you are.

255
00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:57.654
Good.

256
00:35:00.281 --> 00:35:01.866
Good luck, lieutenant.

257
00:35:03.785 --> 00:35:04.936
Thank you.

258
00:35:09.224 --> 00:35:10.375
Jake and Jim!

259
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.971
Good mule! Good mule!

260
00:35:24.597 --> 00:35:26.098
Haw up there now!

261
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:28.960
Haw!

262

Haw up there! Haw up there!
Haw up there!

263
00:35:38.153 --> 00:35:39.528
Good boy.

264
00:35:40.613 --> 00:35:42.990
Come on, now.
Get up on there.

265
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.785
Haw now. Good mules!

266
00:35:50.123 --> 00:35:51.582
Haw up there.

267
00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.323
Haw up there.

Bad horse.

276
00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:39.497
Bad horse.

288

Come on, Cisco.
One more time.

289
00:42:30.898 --> 00:42:32.187
Git up!

290
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:35.357
Come on.
Git up, Cisco.

291
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:40.012
Git up.

292
00:42:41.284 --> 00:42:42.865
Git up. There you go.

293
00:42:43.244 --> 00:42:44.324
Easy.

294
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.320
Easy, whoa.

295
00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:28.660
Only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see.

296
00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:31.079
Maybe there's more than one.

297
00:43:31.542 --> 00:43:33.999
There might be three or four.

298
00:43:34.629 --> 00:43:38.303
I know three or four who
will not be making the trip back home.

299
00:43:38.808 --> 00:43:41.948
We have nothing
to show for this trail.

300
00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:47.595
We have no rifles!
White men are sure to have rifles!

301
00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:52.434
It's hard to say
how many might be down there.

302
00:43:59.628 --> 00:44:02.427
We should forget this
and go home.

303
00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:04.571
Then go.

304
00:44:05.117 --> 00:44:07.123
I would rather die

305
00:44:07.203 --> 00:44:11.077
than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country.

306
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:12.996
Understand?

307
00:44:21.509 --> 00:44:25.033
He will not quit
until we are all dead.

308
00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.259
Look at me.

309
00:45:58.189 --> 00:46:00.727
Don't... hurt my mules.

310
00:46:06.447 --> 00:46:08.844
Stop. Stop it.

311
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:35.554

when I got no shoes to put on?

352
00:53:33.727 --> 00:53:39.807
How can I marry a pretty little girl
when I got no hat to put on?

353
00:54:03.257 --> 00:54:06.249
Oh, soldier, oh, soldier
won't you marry me

354
00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.794
before the fight comes home?

355
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:14.342
How can I marry an ugly little girl
when I got a pretty wife back home?

356
00:55:07.753 --> 00:55:11.298
Here. Here.

357
00:55:15.162 --> 00:55:16.403
You there!

358
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.300
Hey!

359
00:55:59.623 --> 00:56:02.416
<i>"Have made first
contact with a wild Indian.</i>

360
00:56:02.501 --> 00:56:05.452
<i>"One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.</i>

361
00:56:05.712 --> 00:56:08.455
<i>"When I appeareq,
he became frightened and ran off.</i>

362
00:56:09.216 --> 00:56:13.209
<i>"Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.</i>

363
00:56:13.328 --> 00:56:16.337
<i>"Keeping only the barest
necessities for myself.</i>

364
00:56:21.928 --> 00:56:25.312
<i>"My afternoon rides have been pared
down to short circular patrols</i>

365
00:56:25.399 --> 00:56:27.474
<i>"always keeping the post in sight.</i>

366
00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:31.394
<i>“I'm taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.</i>

367
00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.322
<i>"Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity,</i>

368
00:56:34.408 --> 00:56:37.775
<i>"but I'm assuming that where there is one,
there's sure to be another.</i>

369
00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:43.438
<i>"Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion</i>

370
00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:45.366
<i>"of strength and stability.</i>

371
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:50.325
<i>“I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon,</i>

372
00:56:50.416 --> 00:56:52.040
<i>"all may be lost.”</i>

373
00:57:08.075 --> 00:57:12.476
Kicking Bird has been keeping
to himself these last few days.

374
00:57:13.805 --> 00:57:17.690
I do not like to see
our medicine man walking so alone.

375
00:57:20.254 --> 00:57:22.595
What does his wife say?

376
00:57:22.598 --> 00:57:25.389
She says that
he is keeping to himself.

377
00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:27.975
That's not what I asked you.

378
00:57:28.053 --> 00:57:29.509
Well, what did you ask me?

379
00:57:29.547 --> 00:57:31.896
What did she say?

380
00:57:31.899 --> 00:57:35.082
She said that he is
keeping to himself these days.

381
00:57:36.136 --> 00:57:38.085
That's what she says.

382
00:57:39.757 --> 00:57:44.341
Make sure that meat is soft.
My teeth hurt.

383
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:51.807
Look at that.

384
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:57.229
Hello. May I come in?

385
00:57:57.411 --> 00:57:59.565
- Come in, come in.
- Oh, thank you.

386
00:58:02.151 --> 00:58:04.319
How are you?
I hope you're good.

387
00:58:07.615 --> 00:58:08.816
Come here.

388
00:58:08.916 --> 00:58:12.828
No, it's ok.
Let him sit with me.

389
00:58:14.038 --> 00:58:15.189
No.

390
00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:20.919
Our country...
seems good this summer,

391
00:58:21.587 --> 00:58:25.924
but I have not been out to see it.

392
00:58:26.453 --> 00:58:30.262
But the buffalo are late,

393
00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.057
and I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

394
00:58:36.705 --> 00:58:39.755
I was thinking of a dance.

395
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:42.524
Yes, a dance is always a good idea.

396
00:58:43.337 --> 00:58:49.531
It would be good
to have a strong sign.

397
00:58:49.555 --> 00:58:50.640
Right.

398
00:59:03.257 --> 00:59:06.381
There's a funny thing about signs.

399
00:59:06.827 --> 00:59:09.676
We know when they are bad or good.

400
00:59:10.435 --> 00:59:15.023
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

401
00:59:15.152 --> 00:59:18.293
A smart man
will think on these things.

402
00:59:18.856 --> 00:59:22.964
If he is still confused,
he will tell somebody.

403
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:27.903
For instance,
he might tell you or me.

404
00:59:33.428 --> 00:59:36.578
I have seen such a sign.

405
00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:38.897
Really?

406
00:59:52.739 --> 00:59:54.804
I saw a man.

407
00:59:55.042 --> 00:59:57.390
A naked, white man.

408
00:59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.351
Are you sure it was a man?

409
01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:04.505
I saw his sex.

410
01:00:06.828 --> 01:00:08.609
Did you speak to him?

411
01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:12.180
No.

412
01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:29.547
<i>"It's been two days now
and nothing.</i>

413
01:00:29.684 --> 01:00:32.341
<i>"My presence here
must have been reported by now.</i>

414
01:00:32.612 --> 01:00:35.511
<i>"Have made all the preparations
I can think of.</i>

415
01:00:35.615 --> 01:00:38.339
<i>"Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone,</i>

416
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.142
<i>"but will try to make a big impression
when they come.</i>

417
01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:42.393
<i>"Waiting.</i>

418
01:00:42.989 --> 01:00:44.228
<i>"Post-script,</i>

419
01:00:44.366 --> 01:00:47.824
“the man I encountered,
was a magnificent-looking fellow."

420
01:00:58.618 --> 01:01:02.505
He might be a god
or some kind of a king

421
01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:07.209
or a white chief
with special abilities.

422
01:01:07.627 --> 01:01:10.004
That's what I think.

423
01:01:12.686 --> 01:01:15.584
I do not care for this talk
about this white man.

424
01:01:15.884 --> 01:01:19.471
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

425
01:01:19.534 --> 01:01:23.968
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I want to laugh.

426
01:01:24.068 --> 01:01:27.446
We took a hundred horses
from these people.

427
01:01:27.546 --> 01:01:29.565
There was no honor in it.

428
01:01:29.577 --> 01:01:32.326
They don't ride well.
They don't shoot well.

429
01:01:32.326 --> 01:01:33.886
They're dirty.

430
01:01:34.487 --> 01:01:38.724
Those soldiers could not even
make it through one winter here.

431
01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:43.703
I think they will all
be dead soon.

432
01:01:46.094 --> 01:01:49.626
I think this fool
is probably lost!

433
01:01:55.461 --> 01:01:58.593
Wind In His Hair's words
are strong and I have heard them.

434
01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.180
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

435
01:02:02.777 --> 01:02:05.584
But for sure
the whites are coming.

436
01:02:05.639 --> 01:02:07.644
Even our enemies agree on this.

437
01:02:07.674 --> 01:02:12.040
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country,

438
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.303
I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

439
01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:19.698
I see someone who might speak...

440
01:02:19.761 --> 01:02:22.701
for all the white people
who are coming.

441
01:02:22.889 --> 01:02:26.996
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

442
01:02:29.737 --> 01:02:36.381
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

443
01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:40.685
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

444
01:02:41.074 --> 01:02:44.764
He is nothing to us!

445
01:02:44.778 --> 01:02:46.816
I will take some men.

446
01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:48.927
We will shoot some arrows
into this white man.

447
01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:52.155
If he truly has medicine,
he will not be hurt.

448
01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.482
Otherwise he will be dead.

449
01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.450
No man can tell another
what to do.

450
01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:07.370
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter.

451
01:03:07.634 --> 01:03:11.499
If you kill one,
more are sure to come.

452
01:03:17.176 --> 01:03:21.117
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

453
01:03:21.815 --> 01:03:25.221
It's hard to know what to do.

454
01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:30.184
We should talk
about this some more.

455
01:03:30.782 --> 01:03:32.753
That is all I have to say.

456
01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:36.090
Let's go.

457
01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:10.816
What's the matter, now?

458
01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:14.186
We don't think
this is such a good idea.

459
01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:16.939
Look, if we take the horse
of a white god,

460
01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:19.608
they will make up songs about us.

461
01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.102
Maybe.

462
01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:24.388
I'm telling you,
they will ask us to go on raids.

463
01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:27.458
Who gets the horse at the end?

464
01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:28.726
I do.

465
01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:35.399
I do, but we share.
It's a great plan.

466
01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:40.837
It's always the same.

467
01:04:42.228 --> 01:04:43.843


468
01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.599
Yes, sir, I have.
No, I'll ask, sir.

469
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:19.793
- We'll be heroes!
- Real heroes!

470
01:05:22.636 --> 01:05:24.781
They'll write songs about us!

471
01:05:27.084 --> 01:05:28.702
We'll be heroes!

472
01:05:37.784 --> 01:05:39.062
What happened?

473
01:05:40.647 --> 01:05:42.065
What happened?

474
01:05:44.199 --> 01:05:48.613
I don't know,
but suddenly my arm doesn't work now.

475
01:05:50.997 --> 01:05:55.095
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

476
01:05:55.168 --> 01:05:57.455
It was your idea.

477
01:05:57.512 --> 01:06:03.086
My idea was only to take the horse,
it wasn't to fall down.

478
01:06:04.154 --> 01:06:05.572
What happened?

479
01:06:06.264 --> 01:06:07.615
What happened?

480
01:06:07.814 --> 01:06:09.842
Otter hurt himself.

481
01:06:12.711 --> 01:06:14.998
What are you looking at?

482
01:06:15.021 --> 01:06:18.476
I will be dead
when my father finds out about that.

483
01:07:00.118 --> 01:07:02.336
Oh, God.

484
01:08:43.144 --> 01:08:46.456
I am Wind In His Hair!
I am here!

485
01:08:47.173 --> 01:08:50.251
I am Wind In His Hair!
I am here!

486
01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:54.389
I am here!
Do you see I am not afraid of you?

487
01:08:54.389 --> 01:08:56.049
Do you see?

488
01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:13.400
The party that went against
the utes is coming back.

489
01:10:13.434 --> 01:10:16.712
There are many hearts
on the ground.

490
01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:54.267
<i>“I realize now
that I have been wrong.</i>

491
01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.478
<i>"All this time,
I've been waiting.</i>

492
01:11:56.579 --> 01:11:58.062
<i>"Waiting for what?</i>

493
01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.698
<i>"For someone to find me?</i>

494
01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.674
<i>"For Indians to take my horse?</i>

495
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:03.318
<i>"To see a buffalo?</i>

496
01:12:03.336 --> 01:12:06.638
<i>"Since I have arrived at this post,
I have been walking on eggs.</i>

497
01:12:06.672 --> 01:12:09.449
<i>“It has become a bad habit
ahd I am sick of it.</i>

498
01:12:09.475 --> 01:12:12.101
<i>“Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.</i>

499
01:12:12.178 --> 01:12:14.754
<i>“I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking,</i>

500
01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:18.458
<i>"but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.</i>

501
01:12:18.476 --> 01:12:20.001
<i>"I am through waiting."</i>

502
01:12:21.479 --> 01:12:22.879
What are you looking at?

503
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.846
Son of a bitch!

504
01:14:08.427 --> 01:14:09.635
No, Wait.

505
01:14:11.130 --> 01:14:12.245
Wait.

506
01:14:14.884 --> 01:14:17.392
Wait, wait.
Wait.

507
01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.454
You need help. You're hurt.

508
01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:22.205
You need help.

509
01:14:24.769 --> 01:14:26.668
Let me--
You need help.

510
01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.938
You need help. You're hurt.
Let me help you.

511
01:14:29.938 --> 01:14:31.298
No, no.

512
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:33.925
Let me help you.

513
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:36.561
- You're-- You're hurt.
- No. No.

514
01:14:36.614 --> 01:14:37.729
You're hurt.

515
01:14:41.786 --> 01:14:42.946
Don't!

516
01:16:45.481 --> 01:16:46.999
Let's play again.

517
01:17:00.404 --> 01:17:03.740
Run away! Run away!
Run away!

518
01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:06.768
Run away! Run away!

519
01:17:07.711 --> 01:17:10.072
Run away! Run away!

520
01:17:10.196 --> 01:17:13.901
Run away! Run away!

521
01:18:02.061 --> 01:18:03.550
She's hurt.

522
01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.432
She's hurt.

523
01:18:22.456 --> 01:18:24.320
You are not welcome here!

524
01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:26.806
You are not welcome here!

525
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.618
No. She's hurt.

526
01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:35.581
Go away!
Go away from us!

527
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.009
You are not welcome here!
Go! Go away from us!

528
01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:27.866
- Get him!
- Get him now!

529
01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:29.385
Get him!

530
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:31.428
Stop, stop.

531
01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:34.431
The soldier did not
come here to fight.

532
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:36.976
He is going away
and we will let him.

533
01:19:37.477 --> 01:19:38.836
Go away.

534
01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:07.464
I am in agreement
with Kicking Bird.

535
01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:10.701
We will go down
and talk to the white man.

536
01:20:11.832 --> 01:20:15.138
And find out why he is here.

537
01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:24.323
Listen. Listen to me.

538
01:20:24.881 --> 01:20:27.492
If this council decides
to talk to the white man,

539
01:20:27.492 --> 01:20:29.277
then it will be so.

540
01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:32.623
But in my mind it's not right
that a chief as great as Ten Bears

541
01:20:32.623 --> 01:20:35.534
goes to ask the business of a
puny, trespassing white man...

542
01:20:36.090 --> 01:20:40.789
who has only a smart horse
and a few white man's clothes.

543
01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:44.876
I will not go.

544
01:20:45.691 --> 01:20:47.128
You will go.

545
01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:55.095
And you will go.

546
01:20:56.702 --> 01:20:58.682
That is all I have to say.

547
01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.162
Welcome.

548
01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:23.192
Welcome.

549
01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:26.464
Hi!

550
01:21:33.739 --> 01:21:35.009
Come.

551
01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.428
Please, sit down.

552
01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:39.414
Sit down.

553
01:22:04.478 --> 01:22:06.916
Wait just a minute.

554
01:22:11.435 --> 01:22:13.214
His mind is gone.

555
01:22:13.399 --> 01:22:14.965
Wait, wait.

556
01:22:21.662 --> 01:22:22.697
Tatanka.

557
01:22:27.292 --> 01:22:28.452
Tatanka.

558
01:22:29.319 --> 01:22:30.573
Tanka?

559
01:22:32.517 --> 01:22:33.943
Tatanka.

560
01:22:34.067 --> 01:22:35.569
Ta-- Tanka.

561
01:22:35.593 --> 01:22:38.139
No. Tatanka.

562
01:22:38.656 --> 01:22:39.948
Tatanka.

563
01:22:40.575 --> 01:22:43.102
- Tatanka.
- Tatanka. Buffalo.

564
01:22:44.318 --> 01:22:46.872
- Buffalo. Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

565
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.111
- Buff--
- Buff. Buff.

566
01:22:52.979 --> 01:22:55.339
- Buff.
- Buffalo. Tatanka.

567
01:22:55.965 --> 01:22:56.965
Got it.

568
01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:01.370
<i>"The Fierce One, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.</i>

569
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.330
<i>"I hope I never have to fight him.</i>

570
01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:06.642
<i>"From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.</i>

571
01:23:06.999 --> 01:23:09.311
<i>"I like The Quiet One immensely.</i>

572
01:23:09.334 --> 01:23:11.280
<i>"He's been patient and inquisitive.</i>

573
01:23:11.295 --> 01:23:13.440
<i>"He seems eager to communicate.</i>

574
01:23:13.505 --> 01:23:16.885
<i>"I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people.”</i>

575
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:18.361
Buffalo.

576
01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:29.481
<i>“I believe I made an even greater
impression on their next visit.</i>

577
01:23:29.521 --> 01:23:33.335
<i>"I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before.”</i>

578
01:24:16.026 --> 01:24:17.670
Is the coffee not good?

579
01:24:18.296 --> 01:24:21.132
It's a straw meal.
It's a straw meal.

580
01:24:23.091 --> 01:24:24.251
Sugar.

581
01:24:25.285 --> 01:24:26.704
Put in.

582
01:24:34.563 --> 01:24:35.563
Tas--

583
01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:37.578
Taste it.

584
01:24:48.934 --> 01:24:50.244
Sugar.

585
01:24:51.269 --> 01:24:52.789
You want some?

586
01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:54.540
You want some?

587
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:01.964
That's a lot.

588
01:25:15.752 --> 01:25:18.089
<i>“It's good to
finally have some company.</i>

589
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:21.088
<i>"So much goes unsaid though
and I have the feeling that these people,</i>

590
01:25:21.174 --> 01:25:23.986
<i>“The Quiet One in particular,
want something from me.</i>

591
01:25:24.136 --> 01:25:26.706
<i>"Made presents of coffee
and most of the sugar.</i>

592
01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:28.891
<i>"It didn't figure to last anyway.</i>

593
01:25:28.932 --> 01:25:30.718
<i>"Don't believe
I go too far in saying</i>

594
01:25:30.809 --> 01:25:33.829
<i>“that a foundation for good relations
is being laid."</i>

595
01:26:09.055 --> 01:26:10.657
Stands With A Fist.

596
01:26:15.195 --> 01:26:16.955
We will talk awhile.

597
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:29.117
Your wounds, are they healing well?

598
01:26:30.544 --> 01:26:32.471
Yes, they are.

599
01:26:36.492 --> 01:26:39.311
You are happy here with my family?

600
01:26:39.344 --> 01:26:41.354
Yes, I am glad to be here.

601
01:26:41.522 --> 01:26:46.401
But, I must say,
I am missing my husband.

602
01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:51.907
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

603
01:26:51.932 --> 01:26:52.974
Perhaps.

604
01:26:58.296 --> 01:27:03.543
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

605
01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:06.838
They are coming
into everyone's country.

606
01:27:06.956 --> 01:27:09.007
I think they will soon be in ours.

607
01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:12.093
This white man who lives
at the old soldier fort,

608
01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:16.973
I have visited him
and I believe his heart is a good one.

609
01:27:18.175 --> 01:27:19.392
Good.

610
01:27:20.644 --> 01:27:22.045
Good.

611
01:27:22.087 --> 01:27:24.522
I am afraid of
the white man at the fort.

612
01:27:25.374 --> 01:27:29.744
I am afraid he will
tell others that I am here.

613
01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:32.539
I am afraid they will try
to take me away.

614
01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.658
I've heard
they take people away.

615
01:27:34.741 --> 01:27:36.826
Every warrior in the camp
would fight them.

616
01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.462
I cannot make
the white man language.

617
01:27:39.505 --> 01:27:42.874
He cannot speak our language Sioux.

618
01:27:43.575 --> 01:27:47.195
It has been a long time
since I made the talk.

619
01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.088
I want you to try.

620
01:27:49.698 --> 01:27:52.517
- I don't know how.
- Yes, you do.

621
01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:55.261
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

622
01:27:55.821 --> 01:27:58.014
I can't. It's dead in me.

623
01:27:59.157 --> 01:28:03.352
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

624
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.772
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

625
01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.816
You must remember.

626
01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:12.386
You must remember!

627
01:28:12.546 --> 01:28:14.155
I can't.

628
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:28.627
Will she make the white words?

629
01:28:29.730 --> 01:28:32.346
She won't try.
She is being difficult.

630
01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:35.384
Well, she's the one who's crying.

631
01:28:35.619 --> 01:28:39.305
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

632
01:28:39.529 --> 01:28:41.056
Mine?

633
01:29:45.397 --> 01:29:47.105
Christine!

634
01:29:52.362 --> 01:29:53.837
Christine!

635
01:29:57.450 --> 01:29:58.884
Christine!

636
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.898
Get them, Joe!
Get them chickens!

637
01:30:04.898 --> 01:30:07.359
- That boy's growing fast.
- Very.

638
01:30:07.359 --> 01:30:09.428
Billy, you get away
from those puppies now.

639
01:30:09.528 --> 01:30:11.119
Mommy, look at my puppies.

640
01:30:11.214 --> 01:30:13.048
Honey, come to daddy.

641
01:30:16.845 --> 01:30:18.053
Damn!

642
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:20.739
Get the kids
and get them in the house.

643
01:30:22.475 --> 01:30:24.386
- Go on!
- Get them in the house.

644
01:30:25.937 --> 01:30:27.328
Christine!

645
01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:31.291
Christine!
Where are you?

646
01:30:32.944 --> 01:30:34.652
I'm up here, mother.

647
01:30:34.654 --> 01:30:36.613
- Get down now!
- Why?

648
01:30:36.656 --> 01:30:37.887
Just do what I--

649
01:30:38.783 --> 01:30:40.867
Come on, honey.
Come back, come on.

650
01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.454
Oh my.

651
01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:49.434
You stay right where you are.
Get back! Do you hear me?

652
01:30:51.087 --> 01:30:52.815
- Hold it right there.
- Joe, get in the house right now!

653
01:30:52.839 --> 01:30:53.847
Just stop.

654
01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:01.052
Willie! Willie!

655
01:31:02.015 --> 01:31:03.551
Who is it, Willie?

656
01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:05.291
They look like Pawnee.

657
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:07.952
My father and your father
are talking to them.

658
01:31:08.955 --> 01:31:11.205
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

659
01:31:12.082 --> 01:31:15.084
Go on. You heard him.
Just get out of here.

660
01:31:27.507 --> 01:31:29.941
Run, Christine!

661
01:31:29.941 --> 01:31:32.769
I said run!

662
01:31:34.839 --> 01:31:38.858
Joe! Joel

663
01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:53.831
Christine!

664
01:32:05.078 --> 01:32:08.429
Mommy! Mommy!

665
01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:10.930
Mommy!

666
01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:40.736
Mmm. Mmm.

667
01:32:45.782 --> 01:32:48.510
Come on, Two Socks.
Bacon.

No. I haven't seen any buffalo.

Sorry.

I have food.
I have-- I have a lot of food.

02:08:04.477 --> 02:08:08.528
He left it on the prairie.
He didn't want it.

878
02:08:11.075 --> 02:08:14.575
Well, you can see
he wants it now.

879
02:08:14.813 --> 02:08:19.288
We all know
that it's a soldier's hat.

880
02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:23.459
We all know who wears it.

881
02:08:24.013 --> 02:08:28.714
If you want you can keep it,
but give something for it.

882
02:08:51.730 --> 02:08:53.097
It's yours.

883
02:08:57.994 --> 02:08:59.328
Thank you.

884
02:09:04.712 --> 02:09:06.794
Good trade.

885
02:11:18.929 --> 02:11:22.011
John: There you are.
Come here, Cisco.

886
02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:21.779
<i>“It seems every day
ends with a miracle here.</i>

887
02:12:22.092 --> 02:12:25.866
<i>"And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.</i>

888
02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:28.852
<i>"To stay any longer
would have been useless.</i>

889
02:12:28.916 --> 02:12:31.705
<i>"We had all the meat
we could possibly carry.</i>

890
02:12:32.061 --> 02:12:34.992
<i>"We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies,</i>

891
02:12:35.092 --> 02:12:37.169
<i>"and only three men injured.</i>

892
02:12:37.675 --> 02:12:40.139
<i>“I'd never known
a people so eager to laugh,</i>

893
02:12:40.139 --> 02:12:43.759
<i>"so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.</i>

894
02:12:44.156 --> 02:12:47.095
<i>"And the only word
that came to mind was 'Harmony.'</i>

895
02:12:56.151 --> 02:12:58.312
<i>"Many times I've felt alone,</i>

896
02:12:58.729 --> 02:13:03.069
<i>"but until this afternoon,
I'd never felt completely lonely.</i>

897
02:13:10.833 --> 02:13:14.915
<i>"Made a long patrol today.
There was nothing to report.</i>

898
02:13:15.588 --> 02:13:17.419
<i>"Time seems irrelevant,
except for the fact</i>

899
02:13:17.506 --> 02:13:20.503
<i>“that I am bored
and these hours alone are endless.</i>

900
02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:45.278
<i>"It is difficult for me to muster any
enthusiasm for my regular duties here,</i>

901
02:13:45.509 --> 02:13:48.364
<i>"and the fort is showing
serious signs of neglect.</i>

902
02:13:50.998 --> 02:13:54.037
<i>"The truth is, I am missing
the company of my friends.</i>

903
02:13:54.376 --> 02:13:57.874
<i>"I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough.</i>

904
02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:00.126
<i>“Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.</i>

905
02:14:00.382 --> 02:14:03.296
<i>“It may be forward of me,
but what can it hurt?</i>

906
02:14:03.385 --> 02:14:05.757
<i>"After all, they are my neighbors.</i>

907
02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:23.459
<i>"The night sounds have become so familiar
as to be comforting.</i>

908
02:15:23.941 --> 02:15:25.672
<i>"My life on the prairie
is a good one,</i>

909
02:15:25.759 --> 02:15:28.447
<i>"and for the most part,
I am content.</i>

910
02:15:42.192 --> 02:15:45.906
<i>“The Indians have a great pull for me
that goes beyond curiosity.</i>

911
02:15:45.988 --> 02:15:47.398
<i>"There's something
wise about them,</i>

912
02:15:47.489 --> 02:15:49.275
<i>"and I find myself
drawn to them in ways</i>

913
02:15:49.366 --> 02:15:52.654
<i>“much stronger than
my obligations to the military."</i>

914
02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:14.193
Go home! Go home!

915
02:17:16.203 --> 02:17:17.513
Damn him.

916
02:17:35.931 --> 02:17:39.802
Hey! God!
Go home!

917
02:17:45.274 --> 02:17:48.144
Go!
Go home, Two Socks.

918
02:17:49.611 --> 02:17:51.564
Bad wolf! Bad wolf!

919
02:18:31.336 --> 02:18:36.483
You were right.
He is a special white man.

920
02:18:36.591 --> 02:18:39.319
Yes. He should have a real name.

921
02:18:54.259 --> 02:18:55.544
<i>"It is Autumn now,</i>

922
02:18:55.636 --> 02:18:58.380
<i>"and I am spending more time
than ever with my friends.</i>

923
02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:01.758
<i>"They have given me my own lodge,
and I feel comfortable there.</i>

924
02:19:02.351 --> 02:19:05.887
<i>"We talk every day, but I know
Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.</i>

925
02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:09.850
<i>"He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.</i>

926
02:19:10.359 --> 02:19:12.253
<i>"I tell him that the white people
will most likely</i>

927
02:19:12.277 --> 02:19:14.729
<i>"pass through this country
and nothing more.</i>

928
02:19:15.072 --> 02:19:17.065
<i>"But I am speaking in half-truths.</i>

929
02:19:17.407 --> 02:19:19.117
<i>"One day there will be too many,</i>

930
02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:21.736
<i>"but I cannot bring myself
to tell him that.</i>

931
02:19:22.062 --> 02:19:25.323
<i>“I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back,</i>

932
02:19:25.524 --> 02:19:27.951
<i>"but to her credit,
she says nothing.</i>

933
02:19:56.905 --> 02:20:00.900
<i>"A war party is going against
the Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.</i>

934
02:20:01.076 --> 02:20:03.317
<i>"I sense that I made
a mistake in doing so,</i>

935
02:20:03.412 --> 02:20:06.030
<i>"but I could not bring myself
to take it back.</i>

936
02:20:06.273 --> 02:20:08.514
<i>"They are my friends,
and from what little I gather,</i>

937
02:20:08.609 --> 02:20:11.160
<i>“the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.</i>

938
02:20:11.486 --> 02:20:14.038
<i>"I hope I have not
overstepped my bounds."</i>

939
02:20:18.677 --> 02:20:20.086
Come in, please.

940
02:20:22.764 --> 02:20:25.258
- Sit down?
- No.

941
02:20:27.319 --> 02:20:29.480
Kicking Bird wants to know

942
02:20:29.771 --> 02:20:33.891
why you want to
make war on the Pawnee.

943
02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:36.811
They have done nothing to you.

944
02:20:37.279 --> 02:20:39.063
They are Sioux enemies.

945
02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:43.317


946
02:20:44.486 --> 02:20:46.496


947
02:20:46.705 --> 02:20:50.291
Only-- Only Sioux warriors to go.

948
02:20:50.609 --> 02:20:52.409
Well, then tell him that
I have been a warrior

949
02:20:52.444 --> 02:20:55.705
longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

950
02:20:56.031 --> 02:20:57.271
Tell him.

951
02:21:12.147 --> 02:21:15.355
He said that the Sioux way
of being a warrior

952
02:21:15.442 --> 02:21:17.768
is not the white way.

953
02:21:17.986 --> 02:21:19.726
You are not ready.

954
02:21:19.821 --> 02:21:20.927
I know, I understand.

955
02:21:21.014 --> 02:21:24.550
But tell him that I cannot
learn these ways in camp.

956
02:21:31.917 --> 02:21:34.618
He also asks that you

957
02:21:35.237 --> 02:21:38.622
watch over his family
while he is gone.

958
02:21:39.633 --> 02:21:43.752
This thing he asks
is a great honor for you.

959
02:21:47.015 --> 02:21:51.018
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

960
02:21:57.317 --> 02:22:00.252
He thanks Dances With Wolves
for coming.

961
02:22:01.655 --> 02:22:04.064
Who is Dances With Wolves?

962
02:22:05.534 --> 02:22:09.026
It is the name
which all the people

963
02:22:09.121 --> 02:22:10.862
are calling you now.

964
02:22:11.456 --> 02:22:12.906
Dances With--

965
02:22:14.317 --> 02:22:15.617
That's right.

966
02:22:16.278 --> 02:22:17.563
That day.

967
02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:20.413
Dances With Wolves.

968
02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:23.708
How do you say it?

969
02:22:34.478 --> 02:22:36.121
- Right.
- Right.

970
02:23:06.835 --> 02:23:08.069


971
02:23:23.545 --> 02:23:29.023
Keep on with the white man talk
if it pleases you.

972
02:23:29.059 --> 02:23:31.518
I like to make the talk.

973
02:23:42.612 --> 02:23:43.980


974
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:48.217


975
02:24:10.331 --> 02:24:12.133
Where are you?

976
02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:13.692
I'm here.

977
02:24:16.498 --> 02:24:18.280
We'll walk.

978
02:24:51.199 --> 02:24:53.657
- Oh, I- I cut this off.
- Oh.

979
02:24:53.657 --> 02:24:56.318
- I shaved it off. More.
- Oh.

980
02:24:58.006 --> 02:25:02.032
- Grass grows on the prairie.
- "Grass grows on the prairie"?

981
02:25:04.084 --> 02:25:05.502
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

982
02:25:05.502 --> 02:25:07.796
You said,
"fire lives on the prairie."

983
02:25:07.796 --> 02:25:09.039
I did?

984
02:25:09.865 --> 02:25:12.250
No--
No laughing, though.

985
02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:15.404
Try this.

986
02:25:16.725 --> 02:25:19.800
"That man is a fighter."

987
02:25:24.149 --> 02:25:25.372
Again.

988
02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:28.725
- "That man is a fighter."
- Okay, I have it.

989
02:25:29.371 --> 02:25:30.977
That man...

990
02:25:33.141 --> 02:25:34.141
Yes.

991
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:38.635
is a bone.

992
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Right?

993
02:25:44.919 --> 02:25:45.919
No.

994
02:25:48.631 --> 02:25:49.713
No?

995
02:25:58.850 --> 02:26:00.173
Try this.

996
02:26:02.395 --> 02:26:06.054
What's the word for "beautiful"?

997
02:26:11.601 --> 02:26:13.894
What are you doing?

998
02:26:14.062 --> 02:26:17.674
It's hot, and we are
sitting in the shade.

999
02:26:22.073 --> 02:26:23.863
I'm hungry.

1000
02:26:42.060 --> 02:26:44.992
How is Dances With Wolves?

1001
02:26:46.486 --> 02:26:48.846
What do you mean?

1002
02:26:49.951 --> 02:26:52.433
How is he learning?

1003
02:26:53.271 --> 02:26:56.479
He is a fast learner.

1004
02:26:57.091 --> 02:26:59.398
What did you think I meant?

1005
02:27:17.792 --> 02:27:22.505
You go--
You go for water today?

1006
02:27:24.298 --> 02:27:25.382
Yes.

1007
02:27:27.043 --> 02:27:30.204
Then let us take you.

1008
02:27:45.373 --> 02:27:47.279
How did you get your name?

1009
02:27:51.713 --> 02:27:55.037
I was not very old

1010
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:58.332
when I came to be with the people.

1011
02:27:58.928 --> 02:28:01.210
And I was made to work.

1012
02:28:01.931 --> 02:28:04.546
I worked every day, very hard.

1013
02:28:05.852 --> 02:28:11.803
There was one woman
who didn't like me much.

1014
02:28:12.859 --> 02:28:17.434
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

1015
02:28:21.576 --> 02:28:23.273
Beat me?

1016
02:28:26.748 --> 02:28:31.832
And one day,
she was calling me these bad names

1017
02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:34.576
with her face in my face,
and...

1018
02:28:35.423 --> 02:28:36.870
I hit her.

1019
02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.042
I was not very big,
but she fell down.

1020
02:28:42.138 --> 02:28:44.878
She fell hard and didn't move.

1021
02:28:45.767 --> 02:28:49.305
And then I stood over her
with my fist

1022
02:28:49.395 --> 02:28:53.762
and I asked if
there was any other woman

1023
02:28:54.067 --> 02:28:56.890
who wanted to call me bad names.

1024
02:28:58.196 --> 02:29:01.144
No one bothered me after that day.

1025
02:29:03.785 --> 02:29:06.608
No, I-- I wouldn't think so.

1026
02:29:11.751 --> 02:29:13.116
Show me.

1027
02:29:14.170 --> 02:29:16.242
Show me where you hit her.

1028
02:29:44.951 --> 02:29:46.898
Why are you not married?

1029
02:29:50.707 --> 02:29:52.447
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

1030
02:29:55.253 --> 02:29:56.584
I'm sorry.

1031
02:29:58.715 --> 02:30:00.161
Can I help you?

1032
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:33.411
You are not talking today?

1033
02:30:33.499 --> 02:30:35.654
No, I am not.

1034
02:31:41.484 --> 02:31:48.101
Some of your words are wrong,
but you are learning fast.

1035
02:31:48.616 --> 02:31:53.148
So what can I tell you today?

1036
02:31:54.388 --> 02:31:56.943
I want to know about
Stands With A Fist.

1037
02:31:56.958 --> 02:31:59.362
Why is there no man with her?

1038
02:32:01.254 --> 02:32:04.367
She is in mourning.

1039
02:32:06.426 --> 02:32:07.812
I don't under--

1040
02:32:08.997 --> 02:32:12.834
I do not understand "mourning."

1041
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.671
She cries for someone.

1042
02:32:18.713 --> 02:32:21.176
Cries for who?

1043
02:32:24.986 --> 02:32:27.473
It is not polite
to speak of the dead.

1044
02:32:27.682 --> 02:32:31.944
But you are new,
so I will tell you.

1045
02:32:31.993 --> 02:32:36.316
She cries for her husband.
He was killed not long ago.

1046
02:32:36.448 --> 02:32:41.237
That is how you came
to find her on the prairie.

1047
02:32:44.505 --> 02:32:48.536
How long will she cry?

1048
02:32:50.303 --> 02:32:55.318
It is Kicking Bird's place
to say when she is finished.

1049
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:58.379
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

1050
02:33:04.010 --> 02:33:05.369
Thank you.

1051
02:33:16.838 --> 02:33:19.525
People are talking about you.

1052
02:33:22.427 --> 02:33:24.113
What are they saying?

1053
02:33:24.364 --> 02:33:26.783
They are saying that...

1054
02:33:27.023 --> 02:33:29.802
they are proud of the medicine

1055
02:33:29.884 --> 02:33:33.164
you are making
with Dances With Wolves.

1056
02:33:35.632 --> 02:33:40.045
I have hurt him,
and I should go talk to him.

1057
02:33:41.154 --> 02:33:43.716
You can't. He is gone.

1058
02:33:44.841 --> 02:33:46.802
He left this morning.

1059
02:36:12.046 --> 02:36:15.700
Bet you were thinking,
"now, why don't he write?"

1060
02:36:16.884 --> 02:36:18.536
Hello, Two Socks.

1061
02:36:46.038 --> 02:36:47.278
Come on.

1062
02:36:48.666 --> 02:36:49.917
Come on.

1063
02:36:51.919 --> 02:36:55.197
I won't hurt you. Come on.
You can do this.

1064
02:36:55.881 --> 02:36:57.408
You can do this.

1065
02:37:01.929 --> 02:37:03.135
Come on.

1066
02:37:15.276 --> 02:37:16.732
This is easy.

1067
02:37:17.278 --> 02:37:19.143
This is easy, Two Socks.

1068
02:38:40.361 --> 02:38:42.262
I am in mourning.

1069
02:38:51.372 --> 02:38:52.814
No, we cannot.

1070
02:38:53.265 --> 02:38:54.405
Yes.

1071
02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:56.901
We must be careful.

1072
02:38:58.129 --> 02:39:00.947
- We must be careful.
- Okay.

1073
02:40:05.321 --> 02:40:06.445
Wait, wait, wait!

1074
02:42:12.406 --> 02:42:13.486
What?

1075
02:42:14.408 --> 02:42:15.848
Trouble.

1076
02:42:39.433 --> 02:42:42.391
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men.

1077
02:42:42.478 --> 02:42:44.247
The Cheyenne hunters
found them not far to the north.

1078
02:42:44.271 --> 02:42:45.411
Soon be in our camp.

1079
02:42:45.411 --> 02:42:49.215
Stone Calf, wait.
I will follow you.

1080
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:52.451
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

1081
02:42:52.529 --> 02:42:54.921
Get your weapons
and come to my lodge.

1082
02:42:54.948 --> 02:42:56.288
- I will go.
- No.

1083
02:42:56.450 --> 02:42:57.957
- I will get them.
- Okay.

1084
02:42:58.452 --> 02:43:00.100
Stone Calf, wait!

1085
02:43:00.137 --> 02:43:01.610
I have-- I have guns.

1086
02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:05.047
I have many rifles.
Many. Many.

1087
02:43:05.071 --> 02:43:06.227
I can get them.

1088
02:43:06.251 --> 02:43:07.866
- At the fort?
- Yes.

1089
02:43:07.867 --> 02:43:09.427


1090
02:43:09.452 --> 02:43:11.279
No, The ride is long.

1091
02:43:11.532 --> 02:43:15.115
Guns would make
Ohne warrior like two.

1092
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:23.832
Take one man and go quickly.

1093
02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.585
I will take Smiles A Lot.

1094
02:43:27.336 --> 02:43:28.587
Go!

1095
02:44:11.004 --> 02:44:13.381
Wait! I will help you!

1096
02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:18.328
Okay!

1097
02:46:52.686 --> 02:46:54.082
Shoot the gun!

1098
02:48:14.913 --> 02:48:16.097
Grandma!

1099
02:48:22.587 --> 02:48:23.738
Get back!

1100
02:51:21.788 --> 02:51:23.975
<i>"It was hard to know how to feel.</i>

1101
02:51:24.124 --> 02:51:26.686
<i>“I'd never been
in a battle like this one.</i>

1102
02:51:26.751 --> 02:51:29.230
<i>"There was no
dark political objective.</i>

1103
02:51:29.462 --> 02:51:31.828
<i>"This was not a fight
for territory or riches</i>

1104
02:51:31.923 --> 02:51:33.593
<i>"or to make men free.</i>

1105
02:51:33.675 --> 02:51:35.515
<i>“It had been fought
to preserve the food stores</i>

1106
02:51:35.594 --> 02:51:37.530
<i>"that would see us
through the winter,</i>

1107
02:51:37.554 --> 02:51:39.840
<i>"to protect the lives of women
ahd children and loved ones</i>

1108
02:51:39.931 --> 02:51:42.047
<i>"only a few feet away.</i>

1109
02:51:42.142 --> 02:51:44.270
<i>"Stone Calf was a great loss,</i>

1110
02:51:44.311 --> 02:51:47.957
<i>"but even the old men could not remember
such a one-sided victory.</i>

1111
02:51:48.023 --> 02:51:51.168
<i>"And I gradually began
fo look at it in a new way.</i>

1112
02:51:51.192 --> 02:51:53.838
<i>“I felt a pride
I'd hever felt before.</i>

1113
02:51:54.487 --> 02:51:57.550
<i>“I'd never really known
who John Dunbar was.</i>

1114
02:51:57.699 --> 02:52:00.228
<i>"Perhaps the name itself
had no meaning.</i>

1115
02:52:00.327 --> 02:52:03.456
<i>"But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over,</i>

1116
02:52:03.496 --> 02:52:06.559
<i>“I knew for the first time
who I really was."</i>

1117
02:53:29.475 --> 02:53:33.988
When we were younger, he always
bragged about how brave he was,

1118
02:53:34.087 --> 02:53:37.599
and what a great chief
he would make.

1119
02:53:37.699 --> 02:53:39.585
He thought I was impressed.

1120
02:53:39.693 --> 02:53:44.740
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo,

1121
02:53:44.764 --> 02:53:49.577
and the first thing this
brave warrior did is run for a tree.

1122
02:53:50.603 --> 02:53:52.806
He would have
forgotten all about me

1123
02:53:52.897 --> 02:53:54.891
if he hadn't needed
my help to climb it.

1124
02:53:54.983 --> 02:53:59.621
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below,

1125
02:53:59.654 --> 02:54:02.991
making loud noises and hitting
her head against the trunk.

1126
02:54:03.091 --> 02:54:06.269
You're lying. You're lying now.

1127
02:54:09.006 --> 02:54:12.400
And I remember this thing
like it was yesterday.

1128
02:54:13.118 --> 02:54:16.986
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

1129
02:54:17.430 --> 02:54:20.550
- Horseback's games are always good.
- No, no. Not tonight.

1130
02:54:21.301 --> 02:54:26.139
I'm tired. I'm tired. Horseback already
has a good rifle of mine.

1131
02:54:26.163 --> 02:54:29.033
- Come on!
- Please excuse me.

1132
02:54:29.509 --> 02:54:31.285
Have a good night.

1133
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:34.230
So he sat on the tree all day.

1134
02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:37.917
And he couldn't stop
staring at the cow.

1135
02:54:37.941 --> 02:54:41.295
The cow thought
we was in love with her.

1136
02:54:43.548 --> 02:54:49.512
Sometimes I see him smiling to himself
and I wonder if he thinks about that cow.

1137
02:55:14.354 --> 02:55:17.414
How long will
Stands With A Fist mourn?

1138
02:55:18.191 --> 02:55:20.209
I don't know.

1139
02:55:23.822 --> 02:55:26.882
I hope it will not be too long.

1140
02:55:29.519 --> 02:55:31.512
Has something happened?

1141
02:55:32.172 --> 02:55:33.597
What?

1142
02:55:34.707 --> 02:55:37.393
She has found love again.

1143
02:55:38.545 --> 02:55:39.937
With who?

1144
02:55:40.497 --> 02:55:42.231
Who do you think?

1145
02:55:42.382 --> 02:55:43.497
Tell me.

1146
02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.859
Dances With Wolves.

1147
02:55:46.244 --> 02:55:47.736
What?

1148
02:55:48.688 --> 02:55:50.739
Are you certain of this?

1149
02:55:51.783 --> 02:55:55.661
When you see them together,
you will know.

1150
02:55:57.130 --> 02:55:58.997
What are people saying?

1151
02:55:59.799 --> 02:56:01.875
They like the match.

1152
02:56:06.973 --> 02:56:09.049
No one is angry?

1153
02:56:09.209 --> 02:56:13.345
It makes sense.
They are both white.

1154
02:56:15.290 --> 02:56:19.434
I suppose I will be the one
to say something.

1155
02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:22.938
She's your daughter now.

1156
02:56:23.548 --> 02:56:25.232
I know.

1157
02:56:30.930 --> 02:56:34.908
Relax. You can't see
everything coming.

1158
02:56:35.502 --> 02:56:38.411
Stop it. Quit your playing.

1159
02:56:52.744 --> 02:56:55.178
- Stands With A Fist.
- Yes?

1160
02:56:55.463 --> 02:56:57.597
You will mourn no more.

1161
02:57:18.519 --> 02:57:21.496
Sit. Sit.

1162
02:57:27.103 --> 02:57:30.338
There's talk
that you want to get married.

1163
02:57:32.333 --> 02:57:33.741
To who?

1164
02:57:34.644 --> 02:57:36.953
To Stands With A Fist.

1165
02:57:37.038 --> 02:57:39.931
- That's the one, isn't it?
- She's in mourning.

1166
02:57:39.991 --> 02:57:43.935
- Not today.
- Kicking Bird has released her.

1167
02:57:44.554 --> 02:57:45.978
He did?

1168
02:57:46.906 --> 02:57:48.773
What are you doing here?

1169
02:57:50.285 --> 02:57:53.110
Kicking Bird told me to
sit here and wait.

1170
02:57:55.265 --> 02:57:57.465
You might have
to wait a long time.

1171
02:57:57.534 --> 02:58:01.786
Smiles A Lot says he saw kicking Bird
riding on the prairie. Yeah.

1172
02:58:03.189 --> 02:58:06.207
He says he was talking to himself.

1173
02:58:06.292 --> 02:58:10.311
A medicine man takes it pretty hard
when he is the last to know something.

1174
02:58:12.098 --> 02:58:14.340
What do I do?

1175
02:58:15.758 --> 02:58:16.884
Hmm.

1176
02:58:17.537 --> 02:58:21.789
You are pretty poor
and a Sioux girl is not for free.

1177
02:58:21.874 --> 02:58:24.225
I don't know
if you can get married.

1178
02:58:28.948 --> 02:58:30.698
I have the buckskin--

1179
02:58:30.717 --> 02:58:32.775
No, that's too much medicine.

1180
02:58:35.054 --> 02:58:39.807
Do you think my horse
is too much medicine?

1181
02:58:41.394 --> 02:58:43.577
For a girl.

1182
02:58:48.318 --> 02:58:52.377
Wait here.
Maybe we can help you.

1183
02:58:52.530 --> 02:58:54.922
- Wait.
- Wait.

1184
02:58:55.908 --> 02:58:57.508
That's all I do, is wait!

1185
02:59:13.415 --> 02:59:15.442
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1186
02:59:17.261 --> 02:59:18.570
Thank you.

1187
02:59:18.681 --> 02:59:22.407
<i>"The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.</i>

1188
02:59:22.435 --> 02:59:25.285
<i>"The generosity of the people
was astonishing.</i>

1189
02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:28.663
<i>"The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.</i>

1190

to give up animals they could not afford.</i>

1192
02:59:40.453 --> 02:59:42.469
"Black Shawl was a mystery.

02:59:43.081 --> 02:59:46.723
"I couldn't guess what she was thinking,

1200

<i>"I spent a sleepless night wondering
what misstep, if any, I had made.</i>

1201
03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:20.131
“I had no idea what
Kicking Bird's decision would be."

1202
03:00:43.891 --> 03:00:45.364
Turn around.

1203
03:00:47.603 --> 03:00:49.202
You look good.

1204
03:00:50.014 --> 03:00:55.583
You know, the man she mourned for,
he was my best friend.

1205
03:00:57.864 --> 03:00:59.795
I didn't know that.

1206
03:01:02.326 --> 03:01:04.800
He was a good man.

1207
03:01:05.079 --> 03:01:08.179
It has been hard for me
to like you.

1208
03:01:09.609 --> 03:01:12.475
I am not the thinker
Kicking Bird is.

1209
03:01:13.079 --> 03:01:15.811
I always feel anger first.

1210
03:01:15.882 --> 03:01:18.105
There were no answers
to my questions,

1211
03:01:18.251 --> 03:01:23.235
but now I think he went away
because you were coming.

1212
03:01:23.631 --> 03:01:25.529
That is how I see it.

1213
03:01:50.208 --> 03:01:52.890
This is a good day for me.

1214
03:01:54.295 --> 03:01:55.768
And for me.

1215
03:01:58.187 --> 03:01:59.671
And also for you.

1216
03:01:59.717 --> 03:02:03.775
If you want this man,
take his hand in yours.

1217
03:02:13.911 --> 03:02:16.455
I declare you husband and wife.

1218

03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:31.094
<i>“my mind began to swim in a way
that shut out everything but her,</i>

1222
03:02:31.157 --> 03:02:33.430
<i>“the tiny details of her costume,</i>

1223
03:02:33.618 --> 03:02:35.557
<i>"the contours of her shape,</i>

1224
03:02:35.787 --> 03:02:37.726
<i>"the light in her eyes,</i>

1225
03:02:37.930 --> 03:02:39.936
<i>"the smallness of her feet.</i>

1226
03:02:40.767 --> 03:02:43.523
“I knew that the love between us
would be served.”

1227
03:02:44.858 --> 03:02:47.527
Have you heard
all that I have said?

1228
03:02:48.471 --> 03:02:52.782
Hey, have you heard
all that I have said?

1229
03:02:55.214 --> 03:02:56.214
Yes.

1230
03:02:57.984 --> 03:03:01.249
Good, then take her inside.

1231
03:03:01.462 --> 03:03:03.093
She is your wife.

1232
03:03:05.950 --> 03:03:07.380
Oh, good.

1233
03:03:08.740 --> 03:03:11.076
I really appreciate it.

1234
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:18.705
Bye.

1235
03:03:24.093 --> 03:03:25.298
Bye.

1236
03:04:09.413 --> 03:04:13.112
Dances With Wolves' door
is closed a lot these days.

1237
03:04:13.125 --> 03:04:16.032
I think they're having trouble
making a baby.

1238
03:04:17.759 --> 03:04:19.785
I don't think
they're having trouble at all.

1239
03:04:24.203 --> 03:04:28.210
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

1240
03:04:52.815 --> 03:04:55.738
Dances With Wolves,
are you in there?

1241
03:04:59.255 --> 03:05:03.620
Today I am riding
to a far away place.

1242
03:05:03.634 --> 03:05:05.430
I would like you
to ride with me.

1243
03:05:21.244 --> 03:05:23.765
It's good to be out.

1244
03:05:24.597 --> 03:05:26.768
Yes, it must be.

1245
03:05:28.126 --> 03:05:30.647
We are trying for a baby.

1246
03:05:31.938 --> 03:05:33.692
No waiting?

1247
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:36.027
No waiting.

1248
03:05:40.112 --> 03:05:45.036
I was just thinking
that of all the trails in this life,

1249
03:05:45.568 --> 03:05:47.873
there is one that matters most.

1250
03:05:48.671 --> 03:05:52.127
It is the trail
of a true human being.

1251
03:05:53.276 --> 03:05:58.174
I think you are on this trail,
and it is good to see.

1252
03:06:17.933 --> 03:06:19.863
We call you The Busy Bee.

1253
03:06:23.992 --> 03:06:25.410
I'm kidding.

1254
03:06:56.147 --> 03:07:00.027
It is said that
all the animals were born here.

1255
03:07:00.251 --> 03:07:04.156
That from here they spread over
the prairies to feed all the people.

1256
03:07:04.989 --> 03:07:08.536
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

1257
03:07:59.577 --> 03:08:01.363
It's quiet here.

1258
03:08:02.624 --> 03:08:03.741
Yes.

1259
03:09:58.629 --> 03:10:03.443
I think that...
we must wait for these people.

1260
03:10:03.467 --> 03:10:04.393
No.

1261
03:10:05.377 --> 03:10:09.382
They've been gone a week.
Maybe more.

1262
03:10:11.659 --> 03:10:14.912
We will water the horses
and go home.

1263
03:11:01.550 --> 03:11:04.645
You always ask
about the white people.

1264
03:11:06.972 --> 03:11:09.550
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

1265
03:11:11.643 --> 03:11:13.612
There will be a lot, my friend.

1266
03:11:14.205 --> 03:11:16.114
More than can be counted.

1267
03:11:18.776 --> 03:11:20.285
How many?

1268
03:11:22.696 --> 03:11:24.148
Like the stars.

1269
03:11:29.929 --> 03:11:31.630
The stars.

1270
03:11:32.756 --> 03:11:34.132
The stars?

1271
03:11:38.429 --> 03:11:42.641
It makes me afraid
for all the Sioux.

1272
03:11:49.848 --> 03:11:52.692
We should tell this to Ten Bears.

1273
03:12:19.002 --> 03:12:21.521
The men who wore this came...

1274
03:12:22.047 --> 03:12:24.307
in the time of my
grandfather's grandfather.

1275
03:12:24.633 --> 03:12:27.894
Eventually, we drove them out.

1276
03:12:28.053 --> 03:12:31.673
Then the Mexicans came here.

1277
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:35.386
In my own time, the Texans.

1278
03:12:35.644 --> 03:12:38.154
They have been
like all the others.

1279
03:12:40.883 --> 03:12:46.020
They take what they want
without asking.

1280
03:12:46.363 --> 03:12:50.833
I don't know if we are ready
for these people.

1281
03:12:51.752 --> 03:12:56.422
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

1282
03:12:57.466 --> 03:12:59.842
This helmet remind me of that.

1283
03:13:02.754 --> 03:13:06.808
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

1284
03:13:07.718 --> 03:13:11.395
Tomorrow we will
strike the village.

1285
03:13:43.462 --> 03:13:46.472
You have everything
from the soldiers' fort?

1286
03:13:46.506 --> 03:13:47.932
Yes.

1287
03:13:47.966 --> 03:13:49.934
There's nothing for me there.

1288
03:13:51.011 --> 03:13:52.436
That's good.

1289
03:14:05.984 --> 03:14:07.326
The journal.

1290
03:14:09.655 --> 03:14:11.288
Stands With-- Wait!

1291
03:14:11.907 --> 03:14:13.176
- It is important!
- No!

1292
03:14:13.200 --> 03:14:15.466
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

1293
03:14:15.561 --> 03:14:19.130
Now, it tells everything
about my life here. You must get it.

1294
03:14:19.256 --> 03:14:22.800
Enough!
We cannot wait for you.

1295
03:14:35.222 --> 03:14:37.731
I'll catch up. I'll catch up.

1296
03:15:17.764 --> 03:15:20.315
Soldier: Injun! Injun!

1297
03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:22.567
- Get him!
- Injun!

1298
03:15:26.405 --> 03:15:28.615
- Keep firing!
- No!

1299
03:15:50.380 --> 03:15:52.789
Stay down. Stay.

1300
03:15:53.557 --> 03:15:54.775


1301
03:15:54.968 --> 03:15:56.517
Oh, God.

1302
03:15:57.711 --> 03:15:58.895
Hey, boy.

1303
03:15:59.765 --> 03:16:01.022
Oh, God.

1304
03:16:01.850 --> 03:16:03.316
It's okay.

1305
03:16:45.569 --> 03:16:49.403
Something has happened.
Dances With Wolves is not coming.

1306
03:16:50.365 --> 03:16:51.989
He must have trouble.

1307
03:16:54.194 --> 03:16:59.814
Pick two good men
and send them back to the soldier fort.

1308
03:16:59.938 --> 03:17:01.040
Yes.

1309
03:17:11.169 --> 03:17:12.534
Bauer: Spivey.

1310
03:17:13.547 --> 03:17:15.929
- Spivey!
- Yeah, sergeant?

1311
03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:18.974
Tell the major he's waking up.

1312
03:17:20.804 --> 03:17:22.603
Move your worthless ass.

1313
03:17:34.284 --> 03:17:37.910
You got yourself a hell of a shiner,
didn't you?

1314
03:17:38.613 --> 03:17:40.370
Soldier: Major's coming through.

1315
03:17:48.904 --> 03:17:52.007
Well, does he speak English?

1316
03:17:52.711 --> 03:17:54.301
I don't know, sir.

1317
03:17:56.047 --> 03:17:57.637
Speak English?

1318
03:17:59.718 --> 03:18:02.517
Talk English?
Talk!

1319
03:18:03.889 --> 03:18:05.604
I speak English.

1320
03:18:10.145 --> 03:18:11.651
Who are you?

1321
03:18:13.682 --> 03:18:17.991
Lieutenant John J. Dunbar.
This is my post.

1322
03:18:18.445 --> 03:18:20.410
Why are you dressed like this?

1323
03:18:22.332 --> 03:18:26.333
I came out from fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1324
03:18:26.953 --> 03:18:28.710
Do you have proof of that?

1325
03:18:31.425 --> 03:18:33.890
My journal's on the bunk
in my quarters.

1326
03:18:33.919 --> 03:18:37.886
My orders are in the journal.
It will tell you everything.

1327
03:18:38.156 --> 03:18:40.680
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1328
03:18:40.967 --> 03:18:43.666
Did you find anything?
A journal?

1329
03:18:43.762 --> 03:18:45.810
No, we didn't find nothing, sir.

1330
03:18:46.431 --> 03:18:47.979
Where's Edwards?

1331
03:18:48.517 --> 03:18:50.189
He's outside.

1332
03:18:54.481 --> 03:18:56.779
He-He didn't find nothing either.

1333
03:19:12.457 --> 03:19:14.422
You turned injun, didn't you?

1334
03:19:15.924 --> 03:19:17.191


1335
03:19:19.130 --> 03:19:20.720
Didn't you?

1336
03:19:25.220 --> 03:19:26.976
What did you say your name was?

1337
03:19:28.056 --> 03:19:29.562
Dunbar.

1338
03:19:30.392 --> 03:19:32.599
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1339
03:19:32.686 --> 03:19:34.567
You say you're an officer.

1340
03:19:34.854 --> 03:19:37.637
Oh, God,
did you read my orders?

1341
03:19:37.737 --> 03:19:39.180
No.

1342
03:19:39.651 --> 03:19:41.449
Well, they're in my journal.

1343
03:19:41.944 --> 03:19:43.576
There are no orders.

1344
03:19:44.114 --> 03:19:45.953
There's no journal.

1345
03:19:50.328 --> 03:19:52.084
Why are you out of uniform?

1346
03:19:54.666 --> 03:19:56.755
I have to relieve myself.

1347
03:19:59.713 --> 03:20:02.011
- Sergeant, take care of it.
- Sir.

1348
03:20:04.175 --> 03:20:05.514
Let's go.

1349
03:20:09.531 --> 03:20:11.620
- He's a white man.
- Doesn't look white to me.

1350
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:15.466
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer. Officer.

1351
03:20:15.545 --> 03:20:17.176
Well, do you salute him
or shoot him?

1352
03:20:26.406 --> 03:20:28.162
Here, you, eyes front.

1353
03:20:33.705 --> 03:20:35.419
I said eyes front!

1354
03:20:38.126 --> 03:20:40.557
Don't shoot him!
Get him! Get him!

1355
03:20:40.629 --> 03:20:42.551
- Get him!
- Get off!

1356
03:20:49.108 --> 03:20:51.701
Get him off!
Get back!

1357
03:21:32.097 --> 03:21:33.768
Why are you out of uniform?

1358
03:21:38.044 --> 03:21:39.858
- What's the army doing out here?
- Hey.

1359
03:21:40.472 --> 03:21:43.053
- Lieutenant's asking the questions.
- Bauer.

1360
03:21:49.322 --> 03:21:51.369
We're charged with apprehending--

1361
03:21:54.661 --> 03:21:58.109
We're charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property,

1362
03:21:58.123 --> 03:22:00.712
retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1363
03:22:00.834 --> 03:22:02.597
There are no hostiles.

1364
03:22:02.597 --> 03:22:04.924
We will ascertain
that for ourselves.

1365
03:22:04.963 --> 03:22:08.036
Now, if you'll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter,

1366
03:22:08.133 --> 03:22:10.513
your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1367
03:22:11.094 --> 03:22:12.630
- What conduct?
- With all due respect--

1368
03:22:12.721 --> 03:22:15.593
Your status as a traitor
might improve,

1369
03:22:15.593 --> 03:22:18.729
should you choose to
cooperate with the United States army.

1370
03:22:21.020 --> 03:22:23.651
There's nothing for you
to do out here.

1371
03:22:27.068 --> 03:22:29.323
Are you willing
to cooperate or not?

1372
03:22:32.257 --> 03:22:33.869
Well, speak up!

1373
03:22:37.665 --> 03:22:41.168
I am Dances With Wolves.

1374
03:22:43.213 --> 03:22:47.158
- What's that?
- I am Dances With Wolves.

1375
03:22:47.158 --> 03:22:49.702
I have nothing to say to you.

1376
03:22:49.758 --> 03:22:52.930
You are not worth talking to!

1377
03:23:02.620 --> 03:23:05.693
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

1378
03:23:07.392 --> 03:23:10.239
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

1379
03:23:12.155 --> 03:23:13.826
Not you, Spivey.

1380
03:23:42.043 --> 03:23:44.606
Lieutenant. Lieutenant.

1381
03:23:45.605 --> 03:23:47.442
Major wants to see you.

1382
03:24:22.459 --> 03:24:23.895
Hey, Spivey?

1383
03:24:28.198 --> 03:24:30.986
Hey, Spivey, you got paper?

1384
03:24:31.359 --> 03:24:34.906
- What's it to you?
- Well, give me some, shit-bird!

1385
03:24:34.998 --> 03:24:36.249
Can you read?

1386
03:24:36.322 --> 03:24:38.483
No, I can't read.
What the hell's the difference?

1387
03:24:38.575 --> 03:24:41.204
You can't read either.
Now, just give me some.

1388
03:24:42.164 --> 03:24:43.799
Well, give me some!

1389
03:24:43.898 --> 03:24:45.933
All right! Hold your horses.

1390
03:26:08.039 --> 03:26:09.608
Bauer!
B--

1391
03:26:11.745 --> 03:26:14.422
Bauer!
Hey, let go of me!

1392
03:26:22.220 --> 03:26:25.191
Lap it up, injun.
Go ahead. Lap it up.

1393
03:26:27.850 --> 03:26:29.465
You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

1394
03:26:29.560 --> 03:26:31.146
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

1395
03:26:32.563 --> 03:26:34.108
It's all right.

1396
03:26:34.732 --> 03:26:36.268
It's all right.

1397
03:26:36.901 --> 03:26:39.071
He's going to get hungrier,
that's all.

1398
03:26:39.404 --> 03:26:41.323
But maybe that don't matter.

1399
03:26:41.864 --> 03:26:44.243
Word is they're going to
ship you back to Hayes.

1400
03:26:44.793 --> 03:26:48.147
And once you get there,
they gonna hang you.

1401
03:26:51.499 --> 03:26:53.961
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1402
03:26:53.985 --> 03:26:55.295
All right.

1403
03:27:09.450 --> 03:27:10.815
Get up in there!

1404
03:27:13.396 --> 03:27:15.565
Get up in there! Hey!

1405
03:27:17.076 --> 03:27:18.168
In there!

1406
03:27:19.829 --> 03:27:21.196
Hey, hey!

1407
03:27:26.819 --> 03:27:27.994
Git up!

1408
03:27:36.711 --> 03:27:38.588
Hey, spivey, what is that?

1409
03:27:39.005 --> 03:27:41.132
Looks like he's following us.

1410
03:27:41.174 --> 03:27:43.134
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1411
03:27:44.427 --> 03:27:46.262
Dang. You missed him.

1412
03:27:46.304 --> 03:27:47.885
Don't shoot, god damn it.
It's my shot.

1413
03:27:47.972 --> 03:27:50.266
- Hey, Wait. I seen him first.
- Get down!

1414
03:27:50.275 --> 03:27:53.144
Look at that stupid bastard.
He ain't even moving.

1415
03:27:53.586 --> 03:27:56.031
Wait a minute! That's my shot!

1416
03:27:56.031 --> 03:27:57.274
Shoot him!

1417
03:27:57.815 --> 03:27:59.993
Get him, Edwards.
He's standing there.

1418
03:27:59.993 --> 03:28:02.237
- He ain't running, is he?
- Shoot him!

1419
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:04.247


1420
03:28:05.406 --> 03:28:07.825
- Jesus Christ!
- Holy shit!

1421
03:28:07.849 --> 03:28:08.993
Bauer!

1422
03:28:10.620 --> 03:28:11.846
He's killing him.

1423
03:28:12.238 --> 03:28:14.190
- Bauer, get him off him!
- Get him now!

1424
03:28:20.922 --> 03:28:22.657
He might have killed you.

1425
03:28:30.214 --> 03:28:32.141
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1426
03:28:39.023 --> 03:28:40.900
Sit down, god damn it!

1427
03:28:52.286 --> 03:28:55.331
That's it.
I got him! I got him!

1428
03:28:57.375 --> 03:28:59.835
Dead shot, boys.
Come on.

1429
03:29:00.987 --> 03:29:03.097
- Son of a bitch!
- Spivey!

1430
03:29:03.097 --> 03:29:05.616
- Get up!
- That's the way you do it.

1431
03:29:05.992 --> 03:29:08.358
Get up! I'm gonna shoot--
Get up!

1432
03:29:08.719 --> 03:29:10.300
- I mean it! Get up!
- Spivey!

1433
03:29:10.388 --> 03:29:12.598
Get up!
Come on, get up!

1434
03:29:12.682 --> 03:29:14.208
- Spivey.
- What?

1435
03:29:14.267 --> 03:29:17.461
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1436
03:29:18.437 --> 03:29:20.147
You men get back here!

1437
03:29:20.271 --> 03:29:21.248
Shit!

1438
03:29:24.252 --> 03:29:26.070
God damn it!

1439
03:29:36.522 --> 03:29:37.831
Get down here.

1440
03:30:04.567 --> 03:30:05.801
Boo.

1441
03:30:13.868 --> 03:30:15.327
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1442
03:30:19.214 --> 03:30:21.458
- Hey!
- All right, Let's go.

1443
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:47.484
I don't see nobody.

1444
03:31:05.503 --> 03:31:06.709
Indians!

1445
03:31:26.398 --> 03:31:27.340
God--

1446
03:32:25.416 --> 03:32:26.832
Bauer!

1447
03:32:29.754 --> 03:32:31.295
Bauer!

1448
03:32:36.969 --> 03:32:38.427
Bauer!

1449
03:34:02.928 --> 03:34:04.512
That's what you deserve!

1450
03:34:49.368 --> 03:34:50.516
No.

1451
03:34:51.726 --> 03:34:53.727
No! No.

1452
03:36:34.578 --> 03:36:35.837


1453
03:36:52.480 --> 03:36:53.847
I love you.

1454
03:37:39.188 --> 03:37:44.147
Dances With Wolves
is quiet these days.

1455
03:37:45.427 --> 03:37:47.442
Is his heart bad?

1456
03:37:57.035 --> 03:38:00.455
Killing the soldiers
at the river...

1457
03:38:02.836 --> 03:38:05.042
was a good thing.

1458
03:38:05.823 --> 03:38:08.671
I was glad killing those men.

1459
03:38:12.688 --> 03:38:18.806
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

1460
03:38:19.470 --> 03:38:22.435
They think I am a traitor.

1461
03:38:27.536 --> 03:38:30.359
And they will hunt for me.

1462
03:38:30.990 --> 03:38:34.780
And when they find me,
they find you.

1463
03:38:36.629 --> 03:38:43.038
I think it would be wise
to move the village now.

1464
03:38:49.458 --> 03:38:51.255
I must leave.

1465
03:38:54.104 --> 03:38:56.844
I must leave and talk
with those who would listen.

1466
03:38:58.229 --> 03:39:00.189
Must leave?

1467
03:39:01.073 --> 03:39:02.558
No! No!

1468
03:39:02.782 --> 03:39:06.478
No! You can't leave!
No!

1469
03:39:07.192 --> 03:39:10.491
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

1470
03:39:12.168 --> 03:39:14.587
Go out now. Go.

1471
03:39:19.922 --> 03:39:22.853
Go out now. Go.

1472
03:39:40.384 --> 03:39:44.516
You are the only white man
I have ever known.

1473
03:39:44.555 --> 03:39:48.478
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

1474
03:39:48.625 --> 03:39:52.591
But I think you are wrong.

1475
03:39:53.247 --> 03:39:55.635
The man the soldiers
are looking for

1476
03:39:56.445 --> 03:40:02.784
no longer exists
and there's a new one instead.

1477
03:40:06.744 --> 03:40:08.581
Let's smoke awhile.

1478
03:40:14.760 --> 03:40:17.465
<i>"With Ten Bears,
it was always more than awhile.</i>

1479
03:40:17.521 --> 03:40:21.177
<i>"There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.</i>

1480
03:40:21.217 --> 03:40:23.054
<i>"But I was sure of myself.</i>

1481
03:40:23.168 --> 03:40:27.267
<i>"I would be an excuse and that's all
the army would need to find this place.</i>

1482
03:40:27.381 --> 03:40:30.061
<i>“I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp,</i>

1483
03:40:30.175 --> 03:40:33.648
<i>"but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.</i>

1484
03:40:33.737 --> 03:40:37.986
<i>"He reminded me that at his age,
a good fire is better than anything.</i>

1485
03:40:38.308 --> 03:40:40.947
<i>"Ten Bears was
an extraordinary man."</i>

1486
03:41:22.202 --> 03:41:23.906
You have nothing to say?

1487
03:41:26.415 --> 03:41:28.160
What can I tell you?

1488
03:41:29.626 --> 03:41:31.455
What's ever on your mind.

1489
03:41:38.218 --> 03:41:40.214
You've made the decision.

1490
03:41:44.975 --> 03:41:47.179
My place is with you.

1491
03:41:47.669 --> 03:41:49.723
I go where you go.

1492
03:41:52.649 --> 03:41:54.311
You're not afraid?

1493
03:41:55.485 --> 03:41:56.897
No.

1494
03:41:59.848 --> 03:42:02.820
I told Ten Bears we'd leave
when the snow breaks.

1495
03:42:10.167 --> 03:42:11.954
Did you tell everyone?

1496
03:42:16.183 --> 03:42:17.668
Not everyone.

1497
03:42:32.099 --> 03:42:33.433
Damn it!

1498
03:42:54.119 --> 03:42:55.830
It's all right.

1499
03:43:29.413 --> 03:43:30.907
You...

1500
03:43:31.648 --> 03:43:33.701
finish your pipe?

1501
03:43:46.430 --> 03:43:47.882
Good pipe.

1502
03:43:49.176 --> 03:43:50.468
Not bad.

1503
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:53.012
Does it smoke?

1504
03:43:55.689 --> 03:43:57.600
I've never smoked it.

1505
03:44:09.036 --> 03:44:12.140
We come far, you and me.

1506
03:44:14.708 --> 03:44:16.577
I will not forget you.

1507
03:45:59.688 --> 03:46:02.641


1508
03:46:05.202 --> 03:46:08.229
Dances With Wolves!

1509
03:46:09.114 --> 03:46:11.550
I am Wind In His Hair!

1510
03:46:12.367 --> 03:46:15.528
Do you see
that I am your friend?

1511
03:46:15.721 --> 03:46:18.156
Can you see you're in my heart?

1512
03:46:19.374 --> 03:46:22.827
Can you see that
you will always be my friend?

1513
03:46:27.241 --> 03:46:30.168
Dances With Wolves!

1514
03:46:31.995 --> 03:46:35.589
Dances With Wolves!

1515
03:46:37.108 --> 03:46:40.803
Dances With Wolves!

1516
03:46:46.927 --> 03:46:51.297
Dances With Wolves!

1517
03:47:02.250 --> 03:47:05.411
Dances With Wolves!

1518
03:47:50.006 --> 03:47:52.708
Sergeant!
Over here! Now!
