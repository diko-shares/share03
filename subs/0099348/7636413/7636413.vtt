1
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.529
Only a white man would make a fire

2
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.909
for everyone to see.

3
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.869
Maybe there is more than one.

4
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.209
There might be three or four.

5
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.169
They won't be going home.

6
00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.419
We have nothing
to show for this trail.

7
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:42.629
We have no rifles.

8
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:48.049
The white men are sure to have rifles.

9
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:52.019
We can't see how many are down there.

10
00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:01.729
Let's forget about this and go home.

11
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.069
Then go.

12
00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:12.369
I'd rather die
than argue about some smoke.

13
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.509
He won't quit until we're all dead.

14
00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:11.649
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself.

15
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.739
I do not like to see
our medicine man going around alone.

16
00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.989
What does his wife say?

17
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:25.199
She says he's keeping to himself.

18
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:29.079
That's not what I asked.
- Well, what did you ask me?

19
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:31.789
She says he's keeping
to himself these days.

20
00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.709
That's what she said.

21
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:42.389
Make sure that my meat is soft.

22
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.139
My teeth hurt.

23
00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.529
May I come in?

24
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:12.119
No, he can sit with me.

25
00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.379
Our country seems good this summer.

26
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.549
But I have not been out to see it.

27
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.639
But the buffalo are late.

28
00:58:29.850 --> 00:58:33.519
I'm always worried about
the bellies of our children.

29
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:42.529
I was thinking of a dance.
- Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

30
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:49.329
It would be good to have a sign.

31
00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:06.639
It's a funny thing about signs.

32
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:09.929
We know when they are bad or good.

33
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.349
But sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

34
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:17.479
A wise man will think about these things.

35
00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.859
If he is still confused,
he will tell somebody.

36
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.319
You or me, for instance.

37
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:28.159
A wise man always does this.

38
00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:37.039
I have seen such a sign.

39
00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.629
Really?

40
00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:57.729
I saw a man.
A naked, white man.

41
00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.939
Are you sure it was a man?

42
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.899
I saw his sex.

43
01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.119
Did you speak to him?

44
01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.119
No.

45
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:02.089
He might be a god.

46
01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.669
Or a white chief
with special abilities.

47
01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.969
We should talk to him.

48
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:15.559
Don't talk like that
about a white man.

49
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.979
He is not a Sioux
and that makes him less.

50
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:23.899
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I have to laugh.

51
01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:28.949
We took 100 horses from them.
There was no honor in that.

52
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:33.199
They ride badly,
they shoot badly, they're dirty.

53
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.959
Their soldiers couldn't even make it
through a single winter here.

54
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:43.129
And these people are flourishing?
I think they'll all be dead soon.

55
01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.469
This fool is probably lost.

56
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.309
Wind In His Hair's words are strong.

57
01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.439
The whites are a poor race,
and hard to understand.

58
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:05.569
But make no mistake.
They will come.

59
01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:08.939
Even our enemies agree on this.

60
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.699
When I see one man in our country,
alone and without fear,

61
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:15.579
I don't think he is lost.
He may have medicine.

62
01:02:15.830 --> 01:02:21.419
I see someone who might speak
for all the white people who are coming.

63
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:26.879
I think treaties can be struck
with a man like this.

64
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.719
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

65
01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:40.269
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

66
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.979
He means nothing to us.

67
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:47.899
We will shoot some arrows
into this white man.

68
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.449
If he has medicine,
he won't be hurt.

69
01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.989
If he hasn't, he will die.

70
01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:03.669
No man can tell another what to do.

71
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.129
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter.

72
01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:12.759
If you kill one,
more are sure to come.

73
01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:20.519
These are confusing questions.

74
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.559
It's hard to know what to do.

75
01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:32.189
We should talk about it some more.
That's all I have to say.

76
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:14.029
What's the matter?
- We don't think this is a good idea.

77
01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.239
If we take the horse of a white god,
they will write songs about us.

78
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:23.789
Maybe.
- They will let us go on raids.

79
01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:28.999
Who gets the horse?
- I do.

80
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:34.799
But we share.
Isn't that a great plan?

81
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.969
It's always the same.

82
01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.009
We will be heroes.

83
01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:24.259
They will write songs about us.

84
01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.449
What happened?
What's wrong?

85
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:48.709
I don't know.
I can't move my arm.

86
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:54.249
You shouldn't have fallen off.
We're in trouble now.

87
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.089
It was your idea.

88
01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:03.219
My idea was to take the horse,
not fall off.

89
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:10.229
Otter hurt himself.

90
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.819
What are you looking at? It hurts!

91
01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:20.569
My father will beat me up with his bow.

92
01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.669
I am Wind In His Hair!

93
01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.879
I am Wind In His Hair!

94
01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:51.349
Do you see that I'm not afraid of you?

95
01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.559
Do you see?

96
01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:14.049
The party that went
against the Utes is coming back.

97
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.929
Many have died.

98
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:27.009
You are not welcome here.

99
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:36.679
Go away. Go away.

100
01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:46.899
Go.
You are not welcome here.

101
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:34.699
Stop! The soldier
did not come here to fight.

102
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:38.659
He is going away, and we'll let him.

103
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:07.269
I agree with Kicking Bird.

104
01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:10.229
We will go
and talk to the white man

105
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.319
and find out why he is here.

106
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:28.879
If this is what the council decides,
it will be so.

107
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.959
But it's not right
that a great chief like Ten Bears

108
01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:35.339
should talk to a puny white trespasser

109
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:40.719
who has only a smart horse
and a few clothes.

110
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:47.599
I'm not going. You're going.

111
01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:55.989
And you.

112
01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:58.869
That will be all.

113
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:14.189
He has lost his mind.

114
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:11.639
Stands With A Fist.

115
01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:17.639
Let us talk a while.

116
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:28.739
Are your wounds healing well?

117
01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:34.239
Yes, they are.

118
01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.409
Are you happy here, with my family?
- I'm glad to be here.

119
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:45.839
I am missing my husband.

120
01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:52.589
Perhaps you will marry again.
- Perhaps.

121
01:26:57.970 --> 01:27:02.939
We get word from many places
that the whites are coming.

122
01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:08.939
They are coming to everyone's land,
and soon they will come to ours.

123
01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:13.779
The white man at the old fort,
I have visited him.

124
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:17.329
I believe his heart is a good one.

125
01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:24.829
I am afraid of him.

126
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:29.549
I'm afraid he will tell others
that I am here.

127
01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.219
I'm afraid they will come
to take me away.

128
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:37.299
All our warriors would protect you.

129
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:42.099
I don't know the white man's language,
and he doesn't speak Sioux.

130
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:46.359
It has been a long time
since I spoke their language.

131
01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.729
I want you to try.
- I don't know how.

132
01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:53.149
Yes, you do.
- No.

133
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.779
Yes.
- It's dead in me.

134
01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:01.539
I don't ask this for me,
but for all the people.

135
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:06.539
He knows many things
about the whites.

136
01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:10.299
You must remember.

137
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:14.299
You must remember.
- I can't.

138
01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:28.189
Will she make the white words?

139
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:32.649
She won't try.
She's being difficult.

140
01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.739
She's crying.
Maybe the difficulty is yours.

141
01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:37.429
We've been waiting for you.

142
01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.399
We've been waiting.

143
01:36:51.610 --> 01:36:55.149
Tell him that we are glad that he is here.

144
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:24.349
Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.

145
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:52.589
He's right.
introductions should come first.

146
02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:34.069
l found it on the prairie.
It's mine.

147
02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:03.809
That hat belongs to the lieutenant.

148
02:08:04.020 --> 02:08:08.819
He left it on the prairie.
He didn't want it.

149
02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:14.529
Well, you can see he wants it now.

150
02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:19.079
We all know that it is a soldier's hat.

151
02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:24.079
We all know who wears it.

152
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:29.799
If you want to keep it
you have to give him something.

153
02:18:31.540 --> 02:18:36.589
You were right.
He is a very special white man.

154
02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:39.469
He should have a real name.

155
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:28.799
You can keep talking in
the white man's tongue, if you like.

156
02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:31.509
I like to talk.

157
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:13.919
What are you doing?

158
02:26:14.130 --> 02:26:18.759
It's hot,
so we're sitting in the shade.

159
02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:25.219
I'm hungry.

160
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:46.409
How is Dances With Wolves?

161
02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:52.499
What do you mean?
- How is he learning?

162
02:26:53.790 --> 02:26:56.959
He is a fast learner.

163
02:26:57.170 --> 02:27:01.219
What did you think I meant?

164
02:27:17.730 --> 02:27:22.029
You go to get water?

165
02:27:27.080 --> 02:27:30.079
Let us take you.

166
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:36.309
You are not talking to him today?
- No, I'm not.

167
02:31:41.710 --> 02:31:48.129
You make a few mistakes,
but you're learning fast.

168
02:31:48.380 --> 02:31:53.089
So what can I tell you today?

169
02:31:54.430 --> 02:31:59.599
About Stands With A Fist.
Why is she not married?

170
02:32:01.310 --> 02:32:04.809
She is in mourning.

171
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:12.319
l do not understand 'mourning'.

172
02:32:14.070 --> 02:32:17.579
She cries for someone.

173
02:32:18.700 --> 02:32:21.959
Cries for who?

174
02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:27.999
It is not polite to speak of the dead.

175
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:31.589
But you are new, so I will tell you.

176
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:36.259
She cries for her husband.
He was killed not long ago.

177
02:32:36.510 --> 02:32:41.309
That's how you came
to find her on the prairie.

178
02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:48.149
How long will she be in mourning?

179
02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:53.609
That's Kicking Bird's decision.

180
02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:58.199
He found her when she was very little.

181
02:33:16.840 --> 02:33:20.099
People are talking about you.

182
02:33:22.390 --> 02:33:24.429
What are they saying?

183
02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:27.229
They are proud

184
02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:32.689
of the medicine you are making
with Dances With Wolves.

185
02:33:35.650 --> 02:33:40.869
I have hurt him,
and I should go and talk to him.

186
02:33:41.120 --> 02:33:46.619
You can't. He's gone.
He left this morning.

187
02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.169
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

188
02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:52.169
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

189
02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:54.799
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

190
02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:57.719
l will get them.

191
02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:03.259
Wait. l have guns.

192
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:05.889
Many rifles, at the fort.

193
02:43:06.100 --> 02:43:08.639
At the fort?

194
02:43:09.350 --> 02:43:11.309
No. The ride is long
and we can spare no men.

195
02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:14.109
Guns would make
one warrior like two.

196
02:43:20.360 --> 02:43:24.409
Take one man and go quickly.

197
02:43:24.660 --> 02:43:28.329
I'll take Smiles A Lot.

198
02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:33.729
When we were young,
he always bragged about his courage.

199
02:53:33.980 --> 02:53:36.809
And what a great chief he would be.

200
02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:41.689
He thought I would be impressed.

201
02:53:41.940 --> 02:53:45.779
Once we ran
into a herd of buffalo on the prairie.

202
02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:49.699
This brave warrior
immediately ran for a tree.

203
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:54.289
He would have forgotten all about me
if he hadn't needed a leg up.

204
02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:57.539
We sat up there all day

205
02:53:57.750 --> 02:54:00.419
while an old cow circled the tree,

206
02:54:00.670 --> 02:54:04.089
hitting her head against the trunk.

207
02:54:13.220 --> 02:54:16.639
Where are you going?
There's gambling tonight.

208
02:54:16.850 --> 02:54:19.309
Horseback's games are always good.

209
02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:25.569
I'm tired. And he already
has won a good rifle of mine.

210
02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:31.029
Good night.

211
02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:18.159
How long will
Stands With A Fist mourn?

212
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:21.419
I don't know.

213
02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:27.549
I hope it won't be long.

214
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:34.549
Has something happened? What?

215
02:55:34.810 --> 02:55:38.309
She has found love again.

216
02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:42.059
With who?
- Guess.

217
02:55:42.310 --> 02:55:45.979
Tell me.
- Dances With Wolves.

218
02:55:46.190 --> 02:55:50.069
Are you certain of this?

219
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:56.869
When you see them together, you'll know.

220
02:55:57.120 --> 02:56:02.289
What are people saying?
- They've accepted it.

221
02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.299
No one is angry?

222
02:56:09.510 --> 02:56:13.889
It makes sense.
They are both white.

223
02:56:15.390 --> 02:56:20.349
I suppose
I will have to say something.

224
02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:25.149
She's your daughter now.
- I know.

225
02:56:30.940 --> 02:56:35.659
Relax.
You can't see everything coming.

226
02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:39.369
Quit your playing.

227
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:56.969
Stands With A Fist.
You will mourn no more.

228
02:57:18.410 --> 02:57:21.909
Sit. Sit.

229
02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:32.299
They say that you want to get married.

230
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:36.799
To who?
- Stand With A Fist.

231
02:57:37.010 --> 02:57:40.009
It's her, isn't it?
- She's in mourning.

232
02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:41.519
Not today.

233
02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:44.229
Kicking Bird has released her.

234
02:57:44.430 --> 02:57:45.889
He did?

235
02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:50.229
What are you doing here?

236
02:57:50.440 --> 02:57:55.069
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

237
02:57:55.320 --> 02:57:57.449
You might have to wait a long time.

238
02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:02.909
He saw Kicking Bird riding
on the prairie, talking to himself.

239
02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:09.249
A medicine man takes it pretty hard
when he's the last one to know.

240
02:58:12.170 --> 02:58:15.419
What do I do now?

241
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:21.559
You're pretty poor,
and a Sioux-girl is not for free.

242
02:58:21.810 --> 02:58:24.979
I don't know if you can get married.

243
02:58:28.980 --> 02:58:33.359
I have my horse.
- That's too much medicine.

244
02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:39.909
Do you think my horse is too much medicine?

245
02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:44.199
It is for a girl.

246
02:58:48.290 --> 02:58:52.209
Wait here.
Maybe we can help you.

247
02:58:52.460 --> 02:58:57.339
Wait.
- Alright.

248
03:00:43.990 --> 03:00:46.279
Turn around.

249
03:00:47.580 --> 03:00:50.329
You look good.

250
03:00:50.540 --> 03:00:56.289
You know, the man she mourned for
was my best friend.

251
03:00:57.920 --> 03:01:01.089
I didn't know.

252
03:01:02.380 --> 03:01:05.469
He was a good man.

253
03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:09.559
It has been hard for me to like you.

254
03:01:09.810 --> 03:01:13.229
I'm not a thinker like Kicking Bird.

255
03:01:13.440 --> 03:01:18.309
I always get angry first
I got no answers to my questions.

256
03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:23.399
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

257
03:01:23.650 --> 03:01:26.569
That's how I see it.

258
03:01:50.350 --> 03:01:54.099
This is a good day for me.

259
03:01:58.270 --> 03:02:03.939
If you want this man,
take his hand in yours.

260
03:02:45.490 --> 03:02:49.069
Did you hear what I said?

261
03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:53.699
Have you heard all that I have said?

262
03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:01.379
Good, then take her inside.

263
03:03:01.630 --> 03:03:04.879
She is your wife.

264
03:03:08.840 --> 03:03:11.849
Thank you.

265
03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:12.609
We don't see Dances With Wolves
much these days.

266
03:04:12.860 --> 03:04:16.619
They're having trouble making a baby.

267
03:04:17.910 --> 03:04:20.579
I don't think so.

268
03:04:24.330 --> 03:04:28.629
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they're sure to come out.

269
03:04:52.860 --> 03:04:56.449
Dances With Wolves,
are you in there?

270
03:04:59.240 --> 03:05:03.289
Today,
I'm riding to a far away place.

271
03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:06.169
I'd like you to come with me.

272
03:05:20.890 --> 03:05:26.309
It feels good to be out.
- I can imagine.

273
03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:31.279
We are trying for a baby.

274
03:05:31.530 --> 03:05:35.199
No waiting?
- No waiting.

275
03:05:39.410 --> 03:05:43.709
I was just thinking,
of all the trails in this life

276
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:47.579
there is one that matters most:

277
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:52.549
It is the trail of a true human being.

278
03:05:52.760 --> 03:05:58.339
You are on this trail,
and that's good to see.

279
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:20.449
We call you the Busy Bee.

280
03:06:56.190 --> 03:06:59.949
It is said that all the animals
were born here.

281
03:07:00.160 --> 03:07:04.159
From here they spread over
the prairies to feed all the people.

282
03:07:04.370 --> 03:07:08.829
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

283
03:07:59.630 --> 03:08:03.049
It's quiet here.

284
03:09:58.920 --> 03:10:03.049
We must wait for these people.

285
03:10:03.260 --> 03:10:09.009
No. They've been gone
a week, maybe more.

286
03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:14.979
We will water the horses and go home.

287
03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:05.859
You always ask
about the white people.

288
03:11:06.940 --> 03:11:10.699
How many more are coming.

289
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:15.869
There will be a lot, my friend.
More than can be counted.

290
03:11:38.430 --> 03:11:42.729
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

291
03:11:49.780 --> 03:11:53.619
We should tell Ten Bears.

292
03:12:19.060 --> 03:12:21.889
The men who wore this helmet

293
03:12:22.140 --> 03:12:25.149
came in the time
of my grandfather's grandfather.

294
03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:28.189
Eventually, we drove them out.

295
03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:31.609
Then the Mexicans came.
They don't come anymore.

296
03:12:31.820 --> 03:12:37.829
In my own time: The Texans.
They are like all the others.

297
03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:44.539
They take without asking.

298
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:47.839
I don't know
if we are ready for these people.

299
03:12:48.050 --> 03:12:51.129
But I think you're right.
I think they will keep coming.

300
03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:56.759
When I think of that, I look at this.

301
03:12:56.970 --> 03:13:02.309
Our land is all we have.

302
03:13:02.520 --> 03:13:07.399
We will fight to keep it.

303
03:13:07.650 --> 03:13:12.109
Tomorrow we will go
to our winter camp.

304
03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:20.049
Enough.

305
03:14:20.550 --> 03:14:22.519
We cannot wait for you.

306
03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:50.159
Something has happened.
He is not coming back.

307
03:16:50.410 --> 03:16:52.709
He must have trouble.

308
03:16:54.210 --> 03:17:00.549
Pick two good men
and send them to the fort.

309
03:22:37.680 --> 03:22:41.679
I am Dances With Wolves.

310
03:22:46.850 --> 03:22:49.309
I have nothing to say to you.

311
03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:52.729
You are not worth talking to.

312
03:37:39.040 --> 03:37:45.289
Dances With Wolves
is very quiet these days.

313
03:37:45.540 --> 03:37:48.629
Is his heart bad?

314
03:37:57.090 --> 03:38:00.929
Killing those soldiers by the river

315
03:38:02.890 --> 03:38:08.649
was a good thing.
I was glad to do it.

316
03:38:12.820 --> 03:38:19.529
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

317
03:38:19.740 --> 03:38:23.159
They think I'm a traitor.

318
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:31.049
And they will hunt for me.

319
03:38:31.250 --> 03:38:36.379
And when they find me, they find you.

320
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:43.019
I think it would be wise
to move the village.

321
03:38:49.650 --> 03:38:52.479
I will be leaving.

322
03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:59.319
I must go and talk
with those who would listen.

323
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:09.629
Quiet. You make my ears hurt.

324
03:39:12.290 --> 03:39:15.799
Leave us alone.

325
03:39:40.570 --> 03:39:44.409
You are the only white man
I've ever known.

326
03:39:44.620 --> 03:39:48.209
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

327
03:39:48.460 --> 03:39:52.499
I think you're wrong.

328
03:39:52.750 --> 03:39:56.169
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

329
03:39:56.380 --> 03:40:02.049
Now there is only a Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

330
03:40:06.770 --> 03:40:10.349
Let's smoke a while.

331
03:42:54.430 --> 03:42:57.269
It's all right.

332
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:08.749
Dances With Wolves!

333
03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:11.589
I am Wind In His Hair!

334
03:46:11.840 --> 03:46:18.179
Do you see that I am your friend?

335
03:46:19.560 --> 03:46:24.769
Can you see that
you will always be my friend?
