{2033}{2058}[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
{2062}{2106}What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
{2110}{2158}The irezumi does not hide the skin.
{2168}{2224}The tattoo reveals|the nature of the man...
{2228}{2322}...and illuminates the four noble|professions in The Book of Five Rings:
{2334}{2426}The warrior, the artist, the merchant|and the farmer.
{2430}{2489}If there is a conflict|between the needle and the skin...
{2493}{2556}...between the mark and the man...
{2560}{2660}...then perhaps the path you've chosen|is not the path for which you're suited.
{2699}{2737}What did you just say, old man?
{2742}{2769}Huh?
{2785}{2838}I know you didn't just disrespect me,|did you?
{2845}{2888}You that fucking stupid?
{2892}{2974}You disrespect me and I'll tattoo|the ceiling with your fucking brains.
{3059}{3102}No disrespect.
{3131}{3172}You're lucky.
{3176}{3269}I can't kill you|until you finish this thing. Bang.
{3294}{3330}Give me that mirror.
{3334}{3382}Let's see how it's looking.
{3386}{3423}Not bad, not bad.
{3427}{3474}YAKUZA:|Hey, boss. This just came for you.
{3478}{3535}- What is it?|- A letter.
{3546}{3580}So open it, dumbass.
{3692}{3728}What?
{3732}{3811}- What is it?|YAKUZA: It looks like sand.
{3847}{3900}Yep. Sand.
{3908}{3956}- Black sand.|- No.
{4033}{4059}You know what this is?
{4097}{4133}You wanna let us in on the joke?
{4144}{4246}Years ago I watched a man|open an envelope like that one.
{4261}{4302}There were many with him.
{4310}{4401}And they laughed as you laugh now.
{4418}{4496}And then it came from the shadows...
{4500}{4580}...and their laughter|was drowned in blood.
{4638}{4698}What came out of the shadows?
{4708}{4746}I cannot say the word.
{4758}{4794}What word?
{4868}{4918}That night...
{4926}{4991}...one of their blades struck here.
{4995}{5064}I should have died|but for an accident of birth.
{5068}{5185}My heart is here, on the other side.
{5242}{5290}The fuck is that?
{5298}{5354}It looks like a ninja, boss.
{5383}{5417}A ninja?
{5421}{5516}Are you kidding me? That's the word|you're afraid to say? Ninja?
{5537}{5614}Ninja, ninja, ninja.|Yeah, you old fuck.

{8129}{8175}I'll blow your fuck...
{8677}{8759}MAN:|For 57 years, I've told your story.
{8763}{8894}No one ever believed me,|but you are real, aren't you?
{9350}{9394}Is all that for the Delgata case?
{9435}{9464}This is Delgata.
{9488}{9525}- And the rest?|- Evidence.
{9532}{9566}For?
{9574}{9619}Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.
{9623}{9684}What is the problem?|You've trusted my research before.
{9688}{9759}Here's a question. Which of these|does not belong in this sentence:
{9763}{9857}Laptop, space shuttle,|nanotechnology, ninja.
{9881}{9948}All I'm asking for is an hour.|That's all.
{10002}{10064}Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?
{10077}{10109}MIKA:|Remember the Eulmi Incident?
{10113}{10182}Korean queen, late 1800s,|killed by one of these ninja clans.
{10186}{10231}Ozunu, I think.
{10235}{10323}Now, I've been going through|the original transcripts of the trial...
{10327}{10356}...of Kunitomo Shigeaki.
{10368}{10476}The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki|about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.
{10480}{10560}Shigeaki answered that he didn't know|what the prosecutor was talking about.
{10564}{10606}The question|was never brought up again.
{10610}{10669}But what pinged for me was the amount.
{10673}{10747}The exact same amount rumored|to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...
{10751}{10832}...for the yakuza massacre that happened|last week in Osaka.
{10836}{10884}So you wonder,|in this ever-changing world...
{10888}{10938}...if the cost of a man's life|remains the same.
{10942}{11034}Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans|are like, what, a thousand years old?
{11038}{11070}They probably don't change.
{11082}{11171}So I started looking at|international wire transfers...
{11175}{11281}...targeting banks in the regions|of several high-profile assassinations.
{11288}{11342}And bingo.|Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.
{11350}{11396}The day before the assassination...
{11400}{11518}...$1,555,999 and 90 cents...
{11522}{11584}...was transferred|from the Bank of Shanghai.
{11594}{11673}That is the exact market equivalent|of 100 pounds of gold.
{11718}{11803}- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.|- The clans are real, Ryan.
{11807}{11883}They steal children|and turn them into assassins.
{11887}{11944}Look, Mika, no one's denying|the historical facts...
{11948}{12006}...but this thing doesn't make sense|in a modern world.
{12010}{12093}They're real. You can call them spooks|or assassins or whatever you want...
{12097}{12198}...if it makes you feel better, but they are|out there and they are killing people.
{12202}{12254}And nobody is doing a damn thing|to stop them.
{12442}{12484}Hi. Excuse me.
{12497}{12522}Would you mind?
{12545}{12610}If it's not too much trouble,|could you help me with this?

{14298}{14339}It was written during the Cold War...

{26006}{26086}...the report drew attention.
{26091}{26133}After that...
