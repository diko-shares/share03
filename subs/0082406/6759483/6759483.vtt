Huh. Let me see.

[deep sniff]
Ah, shucks, that's easy.

157
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.520
The master's just cookin'

You oughta know that.

158
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.680
Mm-mmm.

159
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.520
That's not what I smell.

160
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.720
I don't know, Chief.

161
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.560
- It's something else.
- [chuckling]

162
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:24.720

OK, Copper, but the master
ain't gonna like you wanderin'
off.

166
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.720
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.

[scoffs]

168
00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.720

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.760
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.

347
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.920
[chuckles]
Your best friend.

348
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.120
Now, Copper's gonna
do what he's been told.

349
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.320
Supposed to chase the little
old fox into the old foxhole,

Yes, sirree!

355
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.080
You mean Copper
is gonna be my enemy?

[Dinky] Hey!

357
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.800

I'm sorry, Tod.

Honey, Copper's gonna
come back

363
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.080
A real killer.

364
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.720
Oh, no,
not my friend Copper.

365
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.680
He won't ever change.

I hope you're right, Tod.

367
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.880
And we'll keep on
being friends forever.

368

Um, won't we, Big Mama?

369
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.320
Darlin',
forever is a long, long time,

370
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:44.160

something I could do.

- Big Mama told me,
you know...
- I just happened to be...

693

[Vixey]
Oh, sure. Why not?

695
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.280
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.600
That's a...
That's a nice name, Tod.

701
01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:17.160
It looks like that farm boy
is makin' it b-b-big with her.

702
01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.560
- [gasps]
- Shh! Now just keep it down.

703

Well, Tod,
you know something?

704
01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.440
This stream is just
full of trout.

705
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.880
Do you think
you could catch one?

706
01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.080
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

707

Oh, Tod, Tod.
Don't overdo it.

711
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.000
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.

712
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.400
Please let him
catch a fish.

713
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.400
[gasps]
Here comes a whopper!

714
01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.640
Now, watch closely.

715
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.840
Tod, do you need help?

716
01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.640
No. No,
I... I do it this way

717
01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.440

718
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.120

[laughing] Oh, that farm boy,
he don't know nothin' about
f-f-fishin'.

720
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.080
He ain't gonna
hook her that way.

721
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.760
[laughing] Oh, gosh!

722
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:34.800
Tod, you're the
funniest thing I ever saw!

723
01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:38.720
Go ahead!
Go ahead and laugh!

724
01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.320
You're like everyone
else around here.

725
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.160
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.

726
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.360
So I can't fish!

I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?

731
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.840
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.

732

Oh, raspberries!
I've had it.
