some research for next year

to a bunch of other sites.

Because that could be
any number of things.

That could be, like, a bowling website.

00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:24.933
That's because of all the
other fun shit I'm off doing.

164
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.894
I'd love to be
at all of them, but...

165
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.937
So why weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

166
00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:30.606
There was just
so many things going on.

167
00:09:30.772 --> 00:09:32.858
I couldn't find a minute to
make an appearance over there.

168
00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:34.026
What did you do?

169
00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:36.570
Um, Saturday was
a crazy night for me.

170
00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:41.575
<i>I had some friends over,
we had a few drinks.</i>

171
00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:43.619
<i>PEOPLE ON VIDEO: That's Vag-tastic!</i>

172
00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:46.538
<i>EVAN: I hung out in my basement,
the chill zone, Where we chill-lax.</i>

173
00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:49.374
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"
all at once.</i>

174
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.960
Seth's parents
were throwing this party.

175
00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:55.130
<i>We got to hang around adults,
which was a nice change of pace.</i>

176
00:09:55.297 --> 00:09:58.759
<i>You converse, you talk to people
and they have interesting stories.</i>

177
00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:02.638
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had
climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

178
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.389
- Wow.
- Then we went to a nightclub,

179
00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:06.266
which was incredible.
This big, fancy one.

180
00:10:06.433 --> 00:10:09.436
SETH: Gonna look at tits right now!
<i>EVAN: "I'm feeling crazy." I said that.</i>

181
00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:11.897
<i>BECCA: You got in?
EVAN: We got right in.</i>

182
00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:13.899
EVAN: Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
FOGELL: Fuck you!

183
00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:16.693
<i>EVAN: Then we called it a night.
We were all just really exhausted.</i>

184
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.446
Oh! What the fuck?!

185
00:10:19.613 --> 00:10:22.866
You would've loved it.
It was an incredible, unbelievable night.

186
00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:24.368
That sounds like a lot of fun.

187
00:10:24.534 --> 00:10:27.496
You know, I'd love to go do
something like that sometime.

188
00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:29.331
Oh, who wouldn't?
I mean, it was like

189
00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:32.709
me and Seth are always
kind of cooking up these

190
00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:35.545
fun sort of little,
you know, events.

191
00:10:35.712 --> 00:10:38.507
So I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

192
00:10:38.674 --> 00:10:41.426
Um, we were going to,
but we got into different schools.

193
00:10:41.593 --> 00:10:43.679
Really? That sucks.

194
00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:47.099
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

195
00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:48.850
I'm not too worried
about it, really.

196
00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:51.687
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried at all.

197
00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:56.775
- All right, well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

198
00:10:56.942 --> 00:10:59.861
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:02.322
Bye, Evan.

♪♪♪

201
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:14.710
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this Class because
I thought I'd be cooking with a partner.

202
00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:18.463
But she's never here, and I don't get
twice the grades for doing all the work.

203
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.716
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

204
00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:23.969
I know, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

205
00:11:24.136 --> 00:11:27.639
Hey, don't keep me waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

206
00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:30.642
You know what I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

207
00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:34.229
I'm over here in my unit, isolated and
alone, eating my terrible-tasting food,

208
00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:35.897
and I gotta look over at that.

209
00:11:36.064 --> 00:11:38.316
Looks like the most fun I've
ever seen in my entire life.

210
00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:41.653
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I wash and dry.

211
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.988
I'm like a single mother.

212
00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:45.157
Look, we all know Home EC
is a joke, no offense.

213
00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.744
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

214
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.913
I'm not putting down your profession,
but it's just the way I feel.

215
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.416
I don't wanna sit here all by
myself cooking this shitty food.

216
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:58.587
No offense. And I just think that
I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

217
00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:00.505
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

218
00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:02.090
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

219
00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:05.260
There's three weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

220
00:12:05.427 --> 00:12:07.637
I'm sorry for cursing.

221
00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:11.141
All right, Jules' partner
isn't here today either.

222
00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:12.768
Pair up with her. Station four.

223
00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:15.103
Jules?

224
00:12:16.354 --> 00:12:18.190
All right.
I'll give it another shot.

225
00:12:18.356 --> 00:12:20.400
I'll give Home EC another shot.

226
00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:32.245
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

227
00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:34.998
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

228
00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:38.668
Nothing. It's my attempt
at humor. I was just...

229
00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:40.670
Oh, like coming.

230
00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:42.923
Like "coming" coming.
Ahh.

231
00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:47.469
Wow, that was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

232
00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:50.555
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that...

233
00:12:50.722 --> 00:12:53.141
No, don't worry.
I'm actually used to it.

234
00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:55.936
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

235
00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:58.271
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

236
00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:00.982
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I know.

237
00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:02.192
I know.

238
00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:04.945
You know, I would've gone with something, you
know, at least, like, mildly entertaining.

239
00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:07.531
You know, like... Like...
Like "family Jules."

240
00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:12.160
Oh, like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

241
00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:14.538
Fucking funny.

242
00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:18.041
- I can't believe that.
- So all right. We gotta

243
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:19.251
mix it up.

244
00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:22.629

246
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.499
Yeah, Hayworth won't notice this,
if we cover it with chocolate.

247
00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:02.002
- The whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

248
00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:03.253
Okay.

249
00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:06.923
- And now it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

250
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.092
- It's beautifully done.
- I think we're gonna get an A.

(LAUGHS)

252
00:14:12.053 --> 00:14:14.139
So, what are you doing tonight?

253
00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:16.224
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't know.

254
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.727
My parents are out of town so I
was thinking about having a party.

255
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:21.229
I don't really know how many
people are gonna be there,

256
00:14:21.396 --> 00:14:23.690
but you could stop by
if you wanted to.

257
00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:26.401
Yeah, I love parties.

258
00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:28.445
Really?

259
00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.156
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

260
00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.033
You know, it's a love-hate thing.

261
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.578
So, like, you know, right now,
I really love them, though.

262
00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:39.247
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

263
00:14:39.414 --> 00:14:40.457
Mm. Mm-hm.

264
00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:41.750
Yeah.

Hey, Miroki, could we have
a minute alone? Just... Thanks.

266
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:47.339
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

268
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.594
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

269
00:14:53.053 --> 00:14:56.139
I was just walking down the hall
and Nicola was right in front of me.

270
00:14:56.306 --> 00:14:59.267
She's wearing these tight white
pants with this black G-string

271
00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:02.520
and you could see right through the
pants, man. It was so sweet.

00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:22.207
I told her what time it was.

277
00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:25.377
That's the coolest fucking stow I've ever
heard in my entire life. That's insane.

278
00:15:25.543 --> 00:15:28.129
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

279
00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:31.132
I'm really gonna miss your knee-slappers
when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

280
00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:33.426
Well, while you guys are at
Dartmouth, I'll be over at State

281
00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:36.721
where the girls are half as smart and
thus twice as likely to fellash me.

282
00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:39.349
What are you guys
doing tonight? Asshole.

283
00:15:39.516 --> 00:15:41.726
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

284
00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:44.813
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
we can get shitfaced again, yeah?

285
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.732
I mean, you're always calling me a pussy
and whatnot, but today you're wrong.

286
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.402
At lunch, I'm going to the
same place Mike Snider went

287
00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:52.487
to pick up my brand-new fake ID.

288
00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:57.242
Chica, chica. Yeah.
Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

289
00:15:57.409 --> 00:15:59.494
That's insane. Because Evan was just
like, "I heard about this party."

290
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:02.497
We shouldn't tell Fogell about it." I
was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."

291
00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:05.375
That way you could buy us booze now.
It's awesome.

292
00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:09.045
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, man, we're gonna get our drinks on.

293
00:16:09.212 --> 00:16:11.756
We're gonna party and get
crunk and rock out, dude.

Fogell! Hi.

296
00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:17.637
Okay. Gotta go.

297
00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:19.848
EVAN: Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

298
00:16:20.307 --> 00:16:22.142
You tell that idiot you're not
rooming with him next year?

299
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:23.351
Not yet. No.

300
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.271
All right, well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

301
00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:28.440
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

302
00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:30.900
We're getting a fake ID, so...

303
00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:33.903
- It's not like a big deal.
- Wow. That's cool.

304
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.239
But you guys have, like,
four more years to cuddle,

305
00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:37.824
so do you wanna get to work?

306
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:40.410
Well, we got into
different schools, so...

307
00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:42.704
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

308
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:45.457
Nothing. Jeez, what does
everybody think is gonna happen?

309
00:16:45.623 --> 00:16:48.501
The world's gonna explode if we
don't spend every second together?

310
00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:51.087
I mean, we're not dependent
on each other, you know.

311
00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:53.673
It's like, we met when we were eight.
We were fine before then.

312
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.676
I was. I mean, it's like,
we don't do everything together.

313
00:16:56.843 --> 00:17:00.513
No. All right, I gotta take a piss. My dick's
not gonna shake itself. Come on, babe.

314
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.474
Oh, yeah.

315
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.394
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

316
00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:11.524
Well, at least we're
getting a graduation party.

317
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:12.859
Thank God, man.

318
00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:14.069
Oh, I'm excited.

319
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.615
I would do terrible,
disgusting things to hook up with Jules.

320
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:20.575
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

321
00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:22.911
I'd give my middle nut

getting fucking sick of you

324
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.502
talking about her like that, frankly,
if we can be honest with each other.

325
00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:32.337
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

326
00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:34.923
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

327
00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:38.426
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

up and she actually thought of me.

That's like the first thing that
came to my mind. Just listen.

like, the nastiest shit.

She's got an older brother.
She could've asked him,

442
00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:25.148

I'll make out with her.

Two weeks, handjob.
Month, blowjob. Whatever.

453
00:23:52.508 --> 00:23:54.093
And then I make her my girlfriend.

454
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.262

two solid months of sex.

467
00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:25.792
I've fully ignored my hatred for
Becca in coming up with this plan.

468
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.795

fuck some girls already.

- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

472

Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds awesome.

That's actually why
I came looking for you.

488

Me and the guys are gonna go
to a liquor store after class.

489
00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:18.970
And I just thought, you know,

490
00:25:19.136 --> 00:25:21.806
if you needed someone to get you
yours, I could do that.

491
00:25:21.973 --> 00:25:23.558
I could be that person.

492
00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:24.976
Yeah.

493
00:25:25.142 --> 00:25:26.686
Um, yeah, no, that would be great.

494
00:25:26.853 --> 00:25:30.231
That would save me such a hassle,
because I was gonna beg my sister.

495
00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:32.817
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

496
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:35.611
Yeah. That's the one with the
little golden flakes in it?

- That's classy.

Well, I'll pay you back
at the party.

No, you won't.
No, it's my treat, miss.

500

- Yep. That's that.

501

It's the first of many too,
so get used to it, sister.

01:24:14.585 --> 01:24:17.171
- What are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been waiting for you.

1606
01:24:17.338 --> 01:24:18.672
She's over there.

1607
01:24:19.507 --> 01:24:20.841
She's way smashed.

1608
01:24:21.008 --> 01:24:23.344
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

1609
01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:25.346
Really? What was she saying?

1610
01:24:25.513 --> 01:24:27.640
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

1611
01:24:27.807 --> 01:24:30.434
No, no. She said
something more like:

1612
01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:33.145
"I willfully blow him tonight."

1613
01:24:33.354 --> 01:24:35.731
- What?
- I know.

1614
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:41.404
- Yeah.
- EVAN: But she's totally hammered,

1615
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:44.490
and if I get with her and I'm not
drunk, isn't that unethical?

1616
01:24:44.657 --> 01:24:46.742
Oh. Not if you're drunk too.

1617
01:24:48.035 --> 01:24:49.453
I guess not.

1618
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.955
To Seth.

1619
01:24:51.122 --> 01:24:53.374
- ALL: To Seth!
- All right.

1620
01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:55.459
Who the fuck is Seth?

1621
01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:56.794
I'm Seth!

1622
01:24:56.961 --> 01:24:58.879
(CHEERING)

1623
01:24:59.046 --> 01:25:01.298
Let's do another one to me.

1624
01:25:12.309 --> 01:25:13.936
Oh, boy.

1625
01:25:14.645 --> 01:25:16.730
Calm down.
Calm down, man.

1626
01:25:16.897 --> 01:25:18.983
Calm down.
She likes you.

1627
01:25:19.316 --> 01:25:21.610
She wants to suck on your penis.

1628
01:25:21.819 --> 01:25:23.487
It's a good thing.

1629
01:25:23.654 --> 01:25:27.324
It's the best thing.

1630
01:25:28.117 --> 01:25:29.827
Just down the hatch.

1631
01:25:57.605 --> 01:25:59.523
Fogell. What's up?

1632
01:26:14.955 --> 01:26:17.541
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

1633
01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:23.380
(GROANS)

1634
01:26:42.858 --> 01:26:44.860
(WOMEN LAUGHING)

1635
01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:48.822
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.

1636
01:26:48.989 --> 01:26:50.407
Can you please help me up?

1637
01:26:50.574 --> 01:26:54.203
I fell down and none of these
assholes will help me up.

1638
01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:56.956
- Shit.
- Becca.

1639
01:26:57.122 --> 01:26:59.250
I have been waiting for you
for, like, ever.

1640
01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.418
- What took you so long?
- I know, it...

1641
01:27:01.585 --> 01:27:04.088
- No, I can't even...
- Do you have my Goldslick?

1642
01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:05.923
It's such a crazy stow, okay?

1643
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.426
- I swear I was try...
- It doesn't even matter.

1644
01:27:09.593 --> 01:27:12.137
Look. Look what we...
We can just drink this.

1645
01:27:12.304 --> 01:27:14.598
- Here. You could have a drink.
- Oh, no.

1646
01:27:14.765 --> 01:27:16.809
- I'm already pretty wasted.
- Take a drink.

1647
01:27:16.976 --> 01:27:19.395
Okay, here's to you.
This is to Becca.

1648
01:27:19.562 --> 01:27:20.688
To Becca.

1649
01:27:20.854 --> 01:27:23.232
- To the respecting...
- Guys.

1650
01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:26.485
...Women. To people
respecting women.

1651
01:27:26.652 --> 01:27:29.697
Okay. Yeah.

1652
01:27:32.116 --> 01:27:33.367
You're a lightweight.

1653
01:27:34.702 --> 01:27:36.120
Hey.

1654
01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:40.416
You and me,
we should go upstairs, because...

1655
01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:44.753
Because I need to
tell you something. Okay?

1656
01:27:45.296 --> 01:27:47.464
You could just tell me
here, I mean...

1657
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:52.428
I can't tell you, because
it's a secret for you from me.

1658
01:27:52.595 --> 01:27:54.680
- All right.
- So come. Come on. Okay.

1659
01:27:54.847 --> 01:27:56.056
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

1660
01:27:56.223 --> 01:27:58.475
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1661
01:28:03.856 --> 01:28:08.235
You changed your name
to McLovin? Wow.

1662
01:28:08.986 --> 01:28:11.655
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

1663
01:28:11.822 --> 01:28:15.743
Hm?
So, like, what's Hawaii like?

1664
01:28:16.368 --> 01:28:17.786
JULES: All right. I am back.

1665
01:28:17.953 --> 01:28:20.247
I had to thank the peeps
for coming out, you know.

1666
01:28:20.414 --> 01:28:22.958
Jules. I want you
to have a drink with me.

1667
01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.502
Just drink some of this.
You're gonna love it.

1668
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:27.504
You're to...
I know you're gonna love it.

1669
01:28:27.671 --> 01:28:31.300
You know, I...
It's green beer. For your information.

1670
01:28:31.467 --> 01:28:34.136
You know, I'm actually good
right now. But thank you.

1671
01:28:34.553 --> 01:28:37.848
And thank you very much for
bringing everything, again.

1672
01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.683
Seriously, it really
made the night.

1673
01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:42.645
No, that's how I roll.
That's the thing.

1674
01:28:42.811 --> 01:28:45.689
It's no problems.
You'll learn that.

1675
01:28:51.445 --> 01:28:56.116
I love talking
and conversing with you.

1676
01:28:56.283 --> 01:28:59.328
But I can't hear you, though,
because the music is so loud.

1677
01:28:59.495 --> 01:29:02.706
So do you wanna go outside
and talk more?

1678
01:29:03.082 --> 01:29:04.667
Um...

1679
01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:08.212
Yeah. Sorry, sure.
You know, why not?

1680
01:29:08.379 --> 01:29:10.381
Let's do it.
I haven't conversed in ages.

1681
01:29:10.547 --> 01:29:14.051
- Okay. Ladies... Ladies first.
- Okay.

1682
01:29:15.052 --> 01:29:17.054
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1683
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.682
- Watch your step. I fell earlier today.
- JULES: Are you serious?

1684
01:29:19.848 --> 01:29:21.975
SETH: Well, I was hit by a car.
It's a long story.

1685
01:29:22.518 --> 01:29:26.271
- BECCA: Oh, shit. Careful.
- Okay, well...

1686
01:29:27.356 --> 01:29:30.567
So loud. Don't let
the parents hear.

1687
01:29:31.193 --> 01:29:33.070
You look so pretty.

1688
01:29:36.365 --> 01:29:40.577
- Are you okay?
- I so flirt with you in math.

1689
01:29:40.744 --> 01:29:42.913
Tell me about it. I... Samesies.

1690
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.669
I've wanted to tell you for so
long that you're the best girl.

1691
01:29:48.836 --> 01:29:53.757
I know. I've wanted to get with
you, like, so hard.

1692
01:29:55.342 --> 01:29:57.720
Like so hard.

1693
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.561
You're the best.

1694
01:30:05.728 --> 01:30:09.273
We'll take this sweater off.
I think so.

1695
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.735
Just be careful, because it's a
meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.

1696
01:30:12.901 --> 01:30:13.986
Okay.

1697
01:30:14.695 --> 01:30:17.614
- Bought it at that vintage market.
- Just hurry.

1698
01:30:18.073 --> 01:30:20.617
- And this one.
- It's off.

1699
01:30:20.784 --> 01:30:22.953
Hey, wait, careful.

1700
01:30:24.079 --> 01:30:25.622
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

1701
01:30:25.789 --> 01:30:27.040
Put that there.

1702
01:30:27.207 --> 01:30:28.959
- Now, looky, looky...
- Oh, my gosh.

1703
01:30:29.126 --> 01:30:31.712
What I got for you under here.

1704
01:30:31.879 --> 01:30:33.714
You are the prettiest girl

1705
01:30:33.881 --> 01:30:36.800
this side of the Mississippi.
I have a little something

1706
01:30:36.967 --> 01:30:39.887
for you under here.

1707
01:30:40.053 --> 01:30:41.138
You look so pretty.

1708
01:30:41.555 --> 01:30:43.891
- Look so pretty.
- Under there.

1709
01:30:44.057 --> 01:30:45.934
Hello.

1710
01:30:47.144 --> 01:30:49.229
For you.

1711
01:30:49.396 --> 01:30:51.690
(HUMMING)

1712
01:30:53.817 --> 01:30:58.280
You're the best. You're so unique.

1713
01:30:58.447 --> 01:30:59.948
Come here.

1714
01:31:00.115 --> 01:31:02.493
Evan, kiss me.

1715
01:31:02.785 --> 01:31:04.620
I like you so much.

1716
01:31:05.662 --> 01:31:07.539
Come on, McLovin.

1717
01:31:07.706 --> 01:31:09.583
I've never been
with an older guy before.

1718
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:13.128
Well, it's way better.

1719
01:31:13.295 --> 01:31:15.506
I know, we made some
kick-ass tiramisu earlier.

1720
01:31:15.672 --> 01:31:19.259
It was deli... It looked weird.
But it was delicious.

1721
01:31:22.387 --> 01:31:23.889
Whoa.

1722
01:31:24.056 --> 01:31:26.975
What...? What's wrong?

1723
01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:31.188
I... I would prefer
if we would just do that

1724
01:31:31.355 --> 01:31:34.942
at some other time.

1725
01:31:35.108 --> 01:31:38.195
No. There is no other time.
School is up.

1726
01:31:38.362 --> 01:31:42.699
- What's wrong with right now?
- Well, I mean, you're... You're drunk.

1727
01:31:43.367 --> 01:31:47.287
- You're, like, really, really drunk.
- So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.

1728
01:31:47.454 --> 01:31:50.457
Yeah, I'm actually...
I'm not drunk at all.

1729
01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:53.210
I don't even drink, so it's...
I mean...

1730
01:31:54.419 --> 01:31:57.548
Jules, you drink. You drink.

1731
01:31:57.714 --> 01:32:00.551
Everybody... You... You had me
get liquor, so you drink.

1732
01:32:00.717 --> 01:32:01.802
It's like...

1733
01:32:01.969 --> 01:32:05.347
Well, yeah, because
I'm throwing a party, remember?

1734
01:32:05.514 --> 01:32:07.140
Other people drink and so I just...

1735
01:32:07.307 --> 01:32:08.851
You...?

1736
01:32:10.185 --> 01:32:13.564
You don't wanna, you know?

1737
01:32:15.315 --> 01:32:18.277
Not, uh, right now.

1738
01:32:18.443 --> 01:32:21.572
You know, not while you're drunk.

1739
01:32:22.155 --> 01:32:24.199
But, you know, thank you.

1740
01:32:29.496 --> 01:32:34.084
- Evan. Evan, I'm so wet.
- Oh, yeah.

1741
01:32:34.251 --> 01:32:37.588
They said that would happen in
health, when I learned about it.

1742
01:32:37.754 --> 01:32:39.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1743
01:32:39.756 --> 01:32:42.926
- They taught me about... Oh!
- Who's down there?

1744
01:32:43.093 --> 01:32:44.386
Yeah, it's your hand.

1745
01:32:45.846 --> 01:32:47.681
Ah-ha-ha.

1746
01:32:49.266 --> 01:32:52.644
- Thank you, that's good.
- You have such a smooth cock.

1747
01:32:52.811 --> 01:32:54.897
Thank you.
You would too if you were a man.

1748
01:32:55.063 --> 01:32:57.608
But you got such a smooth chest.

1749
01:32:57.774 --> 01:33:00.444
I am gonna give you

1750
01:33:00.611 --> 01:33:05.115
the best blow-J ever

1751
01:33:05.282 --> 01:33:07.701
with my mouth.

1752
01:33:07.868 --> 01:33:10.120
Why don't we...?
Why don't we just kiss a while?

1753
01:33:10.287 --> 01:33:13.916
Why don't we keep kissing for a
bit, instead of...?

1754
01:33:15.792 --> 01:33:17.377
How badly do you wanna fuck me?

1755
01:33:17.794 --> 01:33:19.463
Jesus Christ.

1756
01:33:20.213 --> 01:33:21.256
Jesus, fuck.

1757
01:33:21.423 --> 01:33:22.716
- Hang on, one second.
- What?

1758
01:33:22.883 --> 01:33:24.635
Becca, I don't think
you wanna do this.

1759
01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:28.764
- You're really drunk.
- No, I'm not. I am not drunk.

1760
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:33.143
- I see that you are. I think you are.
- And I really... I want you inside me.

1761
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:35.562
I want you to be my first.
I want you inside me.

1762
01:33:35.729 --> 01:33:37.981
So just... Just go with it.

1763
01:33:38.148 --> 01:33:40.108
- Let it happen.
- I know, but...

1764
01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:42.611
Becca, this is kind of intense.

1765
01:33:42.778 --> 01:33:47.157
And I just... I'm so drunk.
I can't even, like, process this.

1766
01:33:47.324 --> 01:33:49.660
And, um, you're really pretty.

1767
01:33:49.826 --> 01:33:51.954
And I just think
this isn't how I pictured it.

1768
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.583
I don't understand why you have to
be such a little bitch about it.

1769
01:33:57.751 --> 01:34:00.921
- Did you just call me a bitch?
- Yes, a scared...

1770
01:34:01.088 --> 01:34:03.715

1936
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:09.802
(SCREAMING)

1937
01:43:11.638 --> 01:43:12.722
Oh, no.

1938
01:43:13.515 --> 01:43:14.599
Fuck.

1939
01:43:14.766 --> 01:43:16.601
(SCREAMING)

1940
01:43:21.231 --> 01:43:24.651
- Slater!
- FOGELL: Officer Slater.

1941
01:43:26.402 --> 01:43:29.405
All right. Fucking crazy.

1942
01:43:30.114 --> 01:43:31.157
Let's do this.

1943
01:43:31.991 --> 01:43:33.201
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Let's go. Go, go.

1944
01:43:33.368 --> 01:43:36.204
FOGELL: I'm going,
I'm going, I'm going.

1945
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:38.581
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here we go, here we go.

1946
01:43:38.748 --> 01:43:40.875
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

1947
01:43:41.042 --> 01:43:43.670
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.

1948
01:43:44.254 --> 01:43:46.297
SLATER: Oh!

1949
01:43:46.464 --> 01:43:48.633
(ALL LAUGHING)

1950
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.345
Yes. Oh, my God.

1951
01:43:52.512 --> 01:43:54.931
It worked. It worked.

1952
01:43:55.098 --> 01:43:59.102
We won. We won.

1953
01:44:07.652 --> 01:44:09.612
Can we shoot at it?

1954
01:44:10.738 --> 01:44:13.908
I don't know. Can you?

1955
01:44:32.677 --> 01:44:34.429
Break yourself, fool.

1956
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:37.557
(YELLS)

1957
01:44:40.768 --> 01:44:42.312
Tight.

1958
01:44:42.478 --> 01:44:45.106
EVAN: Listen, and then she said
she was gonna give me a blow-J.

1959
01:44:45.273 --> 01:44:47.567
SETH: I can't believe
she said that to you.

1960
01:44:47.734 --> 01:44:49.027
Man, you have no idea.

1961
01:44:49.193 --> 01:44:52.113
- What was she thinking?
- You don't even know.

1962
01:44:59.871 --> 01:45:03.916
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

1963
01:45:04.083 --> 01:45:05.460
What?

1964
01:45:05.627 --> 01:45:07.503
I was in your room, like,
three weeks ago

1965
01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:09.964
while you were taking a shit.

1966
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:15.178
And I saw your housing,
like, forms.

1967
01:45:15.637 --> 01:45:19.849
So I knew you and Fogell were
gonna live together, you know.

1968
01:45:20.016 --> 01:45:22.644
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

1969
01:45:24.646 --> 01:45:28.775
I should've told you.
I don't know why I didn't.

1970
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:31.694
Don't... No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

1971
01:45:31.861 --> 01:45:34.656
I was being a dick.
I was being a big dick to you.

1972
01:45:34.822 --> 01:45:36.074
No, I...

1973
01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.703
Listen, Seth, I want you to know,
I don't wanna live with Fogell.

1974
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:45.875
I never wanted to live with him.
I just don't... I ha...

1975
01:45:46.042 --> 01:45:48.211
I'm afraid to live with strangers.

1976
01:45:50.046 --> 01:45:51.214
I can't.

1977
01:45:52.298 --> 01:45:53.508
I can't do it.

1978
01:45:55.677 --> 01:45:58.429
I know, I know.

1979
01:45:59.722 --> 01:46:02.600
I can't believe you saved me.

1980
01:46:04.227 --> 01:46:06.396
You saved me.

1981
01:46:06.562 --> 01:46:09.524
I can't believe.
I owe you so...

1982
01:46:10.358 --> 01:46:14.529
You carried me. I love you.

1983
01:46:15.113 --> 01:46:16.572
I love you, man.

1984
01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:21.577
I love you.

1985
01:46:22.995 --> 01:46:27.667
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just...

1986
01:46:27.834 --> 01:46:29.836
I Io... I love you.

1987
01:46:30.002 --> 01:46:31.713
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

1988
01:46:31.879 --> 01:46:33.381
I love you.

1989
01:46:33.548 --> 01:46:36.342
Why don't we say that every day?
Why can't we say it more often?

1990
01:46:36.509 --> 01:46:38.761
I just love you. I just wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

1991
01:46:38.928 --> 01:46:40.263
"I love my best friend, Evan."

1992
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:44.100
- We should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

1993
01:46:44.267 --> 01:46:50.106
Like, when you went away for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

1994
01:46:50.273 --> 01:46:53.776
- I missed you too.
- I want the world to know.

1995
01:46:54.193 --> 01:46:58.906
It's... It's the most beautiful
thing in the world.

1996
01:47:00.366 --> 01:47:02.326
Boop. Boop, boop.

1997
01:47:02.493 --> 01:47:06.038
Come here. Come here, man.

1998
01:47:16.674 --> 01:47:19.260
- I love you.
- I love you.

1999
01:47:32.231 --> 01:47:34.317
What the fuck?

2000
01:47:41.657 --> 01:47:46.704
- What up?
- Morning. Morning.

2001
01:47:47.163 --> 01:47:49.665
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

2002
01:47:49.832 --> 01:47:52.084
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

2003
01:47:52.251 --> 01:47:55.254
Yeah, you don't... I mean,
you don't have to, you know.

2004
01:47:55.421 --> 01:47:58.508
I don't really have
anything going on.

2005
01:47:58.674 --> 01:48:01.260
You don't have to
rush off like that.

2006
01:48:04.722 --> 01:48:06.808
You wanna hang out?

2007
01:48:07.183 --> 01:48:09.685
I was gonna go to the mall.

2008
01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:13.314
I have to get a new comforter.

2009
01:48:13.898 --> 01:48:16.442
For college. The mall,
they would sell that.

2010
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:18.194
Cool. So, uh,

2011
01:48:19.529 --> 01:48:21.864
your mom's got huge tits.

2012
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:25.743
What do you think?

2013
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:27.328
I don't know, man.
Don't ask me.

2014
01:48:27.495 --> 01:48:30.289
Because I don't give a shit
how pants look.

2015
01:48:30.456 --> 01:48:32.875
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

2016
01:48:33.042 --> 01:48:36.379
Those are too tight.
Those are way too tight.

2017
01:48:36.546 --> 01:48:39.048
- Yeah, but, like...
- Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

2018
01:48:39.257 --> 01:48:41.884
There's not enough pants where
there should be more pant in there.

2019
01:48:42.051 --> 01:48:44.428
Yeah, but... I mean,
does it look weird?

2020
01:48:44.595 --> 01:48:48.015
Looks like you're standing funny. You
wouldn't be standing like that. Like a duck.

2021
01:48:48.182 --> 01:48:49.976
Yeah, but I'm doing like...

2022
01:48:50.142 --> 01:48:53.437
- I'm doing a college poses, it's like...
- I don't know if you are.

2023
01:48:53.604 --> 01:48:55.523
- You might just be doing...
- Hey, prof.

2024
01:48:55.690 --> 01:48:57.775
- Okay.
- That test was... Whoo!

2025
01:48:58.401 --> 01:49:02.280
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

2026
01:49:02.446 --> 01:49:06.075
Yeah, but that's just... It's like I
wish there were more pants where...

2027
01:49:06.284 --> 01:49:07.535
You know, where there aren't.

2028
01:49:07.702 --> 01:49:09.579
But when I was wearing
your dad's pants last night,

2029
01:49:09.745 --> 01:49:12.582
I realized that if I wear pants
that are a little too small,

2030
01:49:12.748 --> 01:49:14.500
it might encourage me
to lose a little weight.

2031
01:49:14.667 --> 01:49:16.586
And also, chicks can
kind of see, like,

2032
01:49:16.752 --> 01:49:19.422
you know, the borders and
outline of my dick a little.

2033
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:22.592
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

2034
01:49:22.758 --> 01:49:25.803
Yeah, the camel tail.
It's right...

2035
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:27.680
I know where it is,
where it happens.

2036
01:49:27.847 --> 01:49:29.515
Like, right there.

2037
01:49:29.682 --> 01:49:33.311
It's like they're so tight that one
ball is, like, above my dick, even.

2038
01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:35.187
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

2039
01:49:35.354 --> 01:49:38.024
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

2040
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:39.567
It's like a division sign.

2041
01:49:39.734 --> 01:49:41.569
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

2042
01:49:42.528 --> 01:49:44.147
Like, does my ass look weird?

2043
01:49:44.172 --> 01:49:46.348
It makes a lot of stuff look weird.

2044
01:49:46.616 --> 01:49:48.075
No, those are way too tight.

2045
01:49:48.826 --> 01:49:51.662
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

2046
01:49:51.829 --> 01:49:55.124
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

2047
01:49:55.291 --> 01:49:57.376
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a new one.

2048
01:49:57.543 --> 01:49:58.836
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

2049
01:49:59.003 --> 01:50:03.090
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

2050
01:50:03.257 --> 01:50:05.801
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

2051
01:50:05.968 --> 01:50:08.804
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit. It's them.

2052
01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.601
- What the fuck do we do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't know.

2053
01:50:15.394 --> 01:50:17.855
- Hey.
- Hey.

2054
01:50:18.773 --> 01:50:20.524
How's it going?

2055
01:50:22.193 --> 01:50:25.029
It's so good to...
How are you feeling?

2056
01:50:25.613 --> 01:50:29.158
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
How about you?

2057
01:50:30.201 --> 01:50:34.372
I'm okay, you know, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

2058
01:50:35.039 --> 01:50:36.457
Uh...

2059
01:50:36.874 --> 01:50:40.461
You know, I actually
don't remember much.

2060
01:50:40.628 --> 01:50:42.213
I don't remember anything.

2061
01:50:43.047 --> 01:50:45.549
- So weird.
- Nothing.

2062
01:50:45.716 --> 01:50:49.178
Um, I didn't puke on you, did I?

2063
01:50:49.595 --> 01:50:51.889
You didn't. I remember
that you... I avoided it.

2064
01:50:52.056 --> 01:50:56.185
It whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay away from me," you know.

2065
01:50:56.769 --> 01:51:02.733
I'm really sorry about everything
last night, and I just...

2066
01:51:04.402 --> 01:51:06.862
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

2067
01:51:07.738 --> 01:51:09.407
That's okay, you know.

2068
01:51:09.573 --> 01:51:12.201
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

2069
01:51:15.579 --> 01:51:18.749
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

2070
01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:23.921
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

2071
01:51:24.088 --> 01:51:26.882
Everything's great, just from he...
This, just like right there.

2072
01:51:27.049 --> 01:51:28.676
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

2073
01:51:28.843 --> 01:51:30.511
Everything else is great.

2074
01:51:30.678 --> 01:51:34.724
But seriously, I acted like
a fucking idiot last night.

2075
01:51:37.393 --> 01:51:41.605
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

2076
01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.277
On the upside,
I think you look cool with a black eye.

2077
01:51:46.444 --> 01:51:49.822
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
I don't... I don't know.

2078
01:51:49.989 --> 01:51:54.035
Well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks.
That's actually, uh, why I'm here.

2079
01:51:54.201 --> 01:51:57.538
Because I have to get a ton of
cover-up for the grad photo.

2080
01:51:57.705 --> 01:52:00.166
Oh, man. Fuck.

2081
01:52:00.332 --> 01:52:02.793
And I'm gonna get Jules
a new comforter.

2082
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.920
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

2083
01:52:05.087 --> 01:52:07.631
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

2084
01:52:07.798 --> 01:52:09.759
So, Seth...

2085
01:52:11.052 --> 01:52:15.056
So do you wanna come buy
me cover-up or something?

2086
01:52:15.222 --> 01:52:17.308
I mean, you kind of owe me.

2087
01:52:18.642 --> 01:52:20.978
Yeah, definitely.
I would love to do that.

2088
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.440
I had such bad acne last year

2089
01:52:24.607 --> 01:52:27.985
that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

2090
01:52:28.527 --> 01:52:31.155
Well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...

2091
01:52:31.322 --> 01:52:33.407
Well, 30... Well, I mean,
I have my dad's car.

2092
01:52:33.574 --> 01:52:36.452
So I could just give you a lift,

2093
01:52:36.619 --> 01:52:38.662
and then Evan
could take Becca home.

2094
01:52:38.829 --> 01:52:41.290
If that works.
I don't know if it's in your route.

2095
01:52:41.457 --> 01:52:42.708
It'd be fine with me.

2096
01:52:42.875 --> 01:52:45.669
Fine, yeah.
Maybe we can get some food.

2097
01:52:46.837 --> 01:52:48.172
Yeah, I'd like that.

2098
01:52:51.008 --> 01:52:52.718
So I guess I'll call you, then.

2099
01:52:52.885 --> 01:52:54.929
Yeah, give me a call.
Yeah, you have my number.

2100
01:52:55.096 --> 01:52:58.182
I have your information.
So put her there.

2101
01:52:58.349 --> 01:53:01.352
Perfect. Good.
All right, man.

2102
01:53:01.519 --> 01:53:02.937
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

2103
01:53:03.104 --> 01:53:04.688
- Becca.
- Bye, guys.

2104
01:53:04.855 --> 01:53:06.440

EVAN: Yeah, that's funny.
Too funny.

01:53:09.944 --> 01:53:11.362
BECCA: Where do you
wanna go to eat?

2107
01:53:11.529 --> 01:53:12.530
(MOUTHING)
<i>I'm gonna fuck her.</i>

2108
01:53:13.823 --> 01:53:17.118
JULES: So can you honestly help me
figure out what kind of cover-up to get?
