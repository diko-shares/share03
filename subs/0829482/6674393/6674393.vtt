1
00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:51.147
Yo.

2
00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:53.357
Hey, man, I was doing
some research for next year

3
00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:56.485
and I think I figured out which
website I wanna subscribe to.

4
00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:59.947
- The Vag-tastic Voyage.
- Which one is the Vag-tastic Voyage?

5
00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:01.657
<i>The Vag-tastic Voyage
is the one where</i>

6
00:02:01.824 --> 00:02:05.161
<i>they find random girls on the street,
and they invite them into a van</i>

7
00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:07.163
and then they bang them
once they're on the van.

8
00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.622
It's like 13 bucks a month,

9
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.499
and you get access
to a bunch of other sites.

10
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:15.004
Like one's Latina, one's Asian, um,
you know, there's one for fetishes

11
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:17.673
like feet and pee-pee and shit
and stuff like that.

12
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.675
That's disgusting.
You're like an animal.

13
00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:22.344
I'm... What? I'm disgusting?
You're the weird one, man.

14
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:24.513
Don't make me feel weird
because I like porn.

15
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.016
You're weird for not liking porn.
I'm normal as shit.

16
00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:28.976
Peeing on people. That's normal?

17
00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:31.520
Evan, I'm not saying
I'm gonna look at it.

18
00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:34.064
I'm just saying that it comes
with the site, okay?

19
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.650
I don't know what I'm gonna
be into 10 years from now.

20
00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:38.527
I'm just sick of all
the amateur stuff, you know.

21
00:02:38.694 --> 00:02:41.906
I mean, like, if I'm paying top dollar,
I want a little production value.

22
00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:44.867
Like some editing, transition,
something. Some music.

23
00:02:45.034 --> 00:02:48.871
You know, well, I'm sorry, Evan, that the Coen
brothers don't direct the porn that I watch.

24
00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:50.664
They're hard to get a hold of, okay?

25
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:53.709
Plus your parents are gonna be
looking at the bill, dipshit.

26
00:02:53.876 --> 00:02:58.297
Yeah, you're right. I probably should pick
the one with the least dirty-sounding name.

27
00:02:59.131 --> 00:03:00.424
Uh...

28
00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:02.593
What about, like, Perfect Ten?

29
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.595
Something like that, you know?

30
00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.388
Like Perfect Ten?

31
00:03:06.555 --> 00:03:08.390
Because that could be
any number of things.

32
00:03:08.557 --> 00:03:11.977
They can't really get you for that.
That could be, like, a bowling website.

33
00:03:12.686 --> 00:03:16.190
Yeah, but they don't really show dick
going in, which is a huge concern.

34
00:03:16.357 --> 00:03:17.399
I didn't realize that.

35
00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:20.152
Plus, have you ever seen
a vagina by itself?

36
00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:22.738
Not for me.

37
00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.406
Hi.

38
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.410
- Thanks for taking him, Seth.
- No... No problem, Jane.

39
00:03:28.577 --> 00:03:30.829
- How are you?
- Good.

40
00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:32.623
Beautiful.

41
00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.251
- Hey! Don't touch that.
- What are you...?

42
00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:38.128
- I'm not a piece of meat.
- You two are funny.

43
00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:41.507
I can't imagine what you're gonna
do without each other next year.

44
00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:43.759
Evan told me you didn't
get into Dartmouth.

45
00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:48.597
I got into some schools, some
pretty good ones. So I'll be fine.

46
00:03:48.764 --> 00:03:51.809
- You gonna miss each other?
- No. Miss each other? No, thank you.

47
00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:53.602
I don't... I don't miss each other.

48
00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.604
Yeah, I'm gonna cry myself
to sleep every night.

49
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:57.356
- Me too.
- When I'm out partying.

50
00:03:57.523 --> 00:03:59.149
Go to school, boys.

51
00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:02.319
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Jane.

52
00:04:03.612 --> 00:04:08.367
I am truly jealous you got to suck
on those tits when you were a baby.

53
00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:11.453
Yeah, well, at least you got
to suck on your dad's dick.

54
00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:25.801
Hey, Seth, you can't
park in the faculty lot.

55
00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.929
Don't be such a vagine, man.
I gotta get a Red Bull before Class.

56
00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:33.100
You know, you're being an idiot,
man. You shouldn't have parked there.

57
00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:34.810
Fuck it. I'm about to graduate.

58
00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.813
They should be sucking
on my ball sac.

59
00:04:38.564 --> 00:04:41.734
It's the least they could do
for stealing three years of my life.

60
00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:48.407
- Oh, fuck me.
- Look at those nipples.

61
00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:50.534
They're like little baby toes.

62
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:52.828
It's not fair that
they get to flaunt that stuff

63
00:04:52.995 --> 00:04:55.122
and, like, I have to hide
every erection I get.

64
00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.958
You know what I do?
I flip my boner up into my waistband.

65
00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.169
It hides it and it feels awesome.

66
00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:02.796
I almost blew a load
into my bellybutton.

67
00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:05.966
I mean, just imagine if girls
weren't weirded out by our boners

68
00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:07.843
and just, like, wanted to see them.

69
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.138
I mean, that's the world
I one day wanna live in.

70
00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:14.475
It's been two years since I've
seen an actual human female nipple.

71
00:05:14.642 --> 00:05:16.602
Shauna?
Shauna was two years ago now?

72
00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:17.811
Yeah.

73
00:05:17.978 --> 00:05:20.439
Yeah, I guess so.
But she was insanely hot.

74
00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:23.859
Exactly. She was too hot, okay?
That's what sucks.

75
00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:26.320
How can that possibly suck?
I'd be psyched if I'd gotten with her.

76
00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:28.030
You got, like, two dozen handjobs.

77
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:30.908
Yes, and three-quarters of a
blowjob, but who's counting, Evan?

78
00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:33.202
Look, it was the peak
of my ass-getting career,

79
00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:34.995
and it happened way, way too early.

80
00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:37.122
- You're like Orson Welles.
- Exactly!

81
00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:39.833
If I'd paced myself,
I'd be having at least steady sex

82
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.335
with a decent-looking girl.

83
00:05:41.502 --> 00:05:44.505
I honestly see now why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death.

84
00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:46.507
You'll have sex in college,
everyone does.

85
00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:49.802
Yes, but the point is to be good at
sex by the time you get to college.

86
00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:52.846
You don't want girls thinking
you suck dick at fucking pussy.

87
00:05:53.013 --> 00:05:55.015
I still think you have a
chance with Jules, man. Really.

88
00:05:55.182 --> 00:05:57.017
And she got incredibly hot
over last summer

89
00:05:57.184 --> 00:05:59.186
and she obviously
hasn't realized it yet

90
00:05:59.353 --> 00:06:02.064
because she's still always talking to
you and flirting with you and stuff.

91
00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:05.275
Are you out of your mind?
Look at Jules' dating record, okay?

92
00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:08.821
She dated Dan Remick, who's had a
six-pack since, like, kindergarten.

93
00:06:08.987 --> 00:06:12.574
Jason Stone, who looks like
fucking Zack Morris. And Matt Muir.

94
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.077
Matt Muir.
He's the sweetest guy ever.

95
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:17.079
Have you ever stared into his eyes?

96
00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.873
It was like the first time
I heard the Beatles.

97
00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.127
Why would she end her high
school career with me?

98
00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:25.379
You know, Becca dated Eric
Rosecrantz for like two years.

99
00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:26.922
Yeah, but that guy's
a fucking idiot.

100
00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:28.882
You're actually a step up
from that dick-load.

101
00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:31.176
That's why you need to stop...
Will you get this for me?

102
00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:33.762
That's why you need to stop
being a pussy and nail her, okay?

103
00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:35.764
You could bang her for like
two months before you leave.

104
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.892
And I'm not gonna dance around
it, she looks like a good fucker.

105
00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.478
All right, I'm tired of you talking
about her like that, man.

106
00:06:41.645 --> 00:06:45.149
What, you can talk about her all day every day,
and the second I say one thing, it's blasphemy?

107
00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:46.942
Yeah, well, I don't
constantly insult her.

108
00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:48.527
I'm not trying to insult her.

109
00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:51.280
I'm just saying that she looks
like a good fucker, okay?

110
00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:52.990
She looks like she can take a dick.

111
00:06:53.157 --> 00:06:55.784
Some women pride themselves
on their dick-taking abilities.

112
00:06:55.951 --> 00:06:58.871
Dick-taking abilities? You think that's
a good thing to say about someone?

113
00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:01.290
The fucked-up thing is,
I actually do, okay?

114
00:07:01.457 --> 00:07:05.085
If some woman tried to compliment me on
my dick-giving abilities, I'd be psyched.

115
00:07:05.252 --> 00:07:06.628
Hey, yo, Seth.

116
00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.882
What?

117
00:07:10.048 --> 00:07:13.135
Did you hear I'm having a
big grad party next Saturday?

118
00:07:15.012 --> 00:07:16.472
- No.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:20.058
- Oh, Shit!
- You're not coming.

120
00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:23.979
Tell your fucking faggot friend
he can't come either.

121
00:07:28.567 --> 00:07:30.319
So Jesse wanted me to tell you

122
00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:32.863
that you're a fucking faggot
and you can't come to his party.

123
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.948
You know, you really
bitched out back there, man.

124
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:36.492
I bitched out?

125
00:07:36.658 --> 00:07:39.453
You bitched out, man,
you fucking Judas.

126
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.829
You fucking left me
hanging over there.

127
00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.040
Did you want me to dive
in front of his spit?

128
00:07:43.207 --> 00:07:44.500
♪♪♪

129
00:07:46.043 --> 00:07:48.170
Come on, guys, let's go!

130
00:08:03.143 --> 00:08:04.686
This is bullshit.

131
00:08:04.853 --> 00:08:07.022
Pussy.

132
00:08:07.523 --> 00:08:11.193
If I equals the square root
of negative one,

133
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.990
then I squared equals
negative one. Okay?

134
00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:19.409
In other words,
if you consider I as a constant,

135
00:08:19.576 --> 00:08:23.372
you can then define the square roots
of all the negative numbers.

136
00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:28.252
So I is an imaginary number.
It doesn't really exist.

137
00:08:28.418 --> 00:08:31.380
If I equals the square root
of negative one,

138
00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:33.465
then I squared equals negative one.

139
00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:36.593
Is this making s...? Okay.

140
00:08:43.183 --> 00:08:44.518
- Okay, bye.
- Evan!

141
00:08:45.018 --> 00:08:46.478
- Evan, hey.
- Hey, Becca.

142
00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:48.313
- Hey, uh, thank you for your pen.
- Hey. Hi.

143
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.149
No problem. No, no, don't worry.
No worries. You just keep it.

144
00:08:51.316 --> 00:08:54.903
It'll be yours. You won't have to borrow
one again because you'll have that one.

145
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.991
- Thank you so much, that's...
- You're welcome. Don't worry about it.

146
00:08:59.157 --> 00:09:00.826
So I was gonna ask you

147
00:09:00.993 --> 00:09:03.537
did you hear about Jesse's
grad party next weekend?

148
00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:07.291
- It should be fun.
- I heard. I... It's a maybe.

149
00:09:07.457 --> 00:09:09.001
- Really?
- For me at the moment.

150
00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:10.711
- Uh, my R.S.V.P.
- Just a maybe?

151
00:09:10.878 --> 00:09:11.920
So far.

152
00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:14.756
There's so much other fun shit
that's gonna be happening that night

153
00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:18.010
that I can't really commit and,
you know, hurt someone's feelings.

154
00:09:18.176 --> 00:09:21.263
Fun shit? But I never see you
at parties or anything.

155
00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:24.933
That's because of all the
other fun shit I'm off doing.

156
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.894
I'd love to be
at all of them, but...

157
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.937
So why weren't you
at Dimitri's on Saturday?

158
00:09:29.104 --> 00:09:30.606
There was just
so many things going on.

159
00:09:30.772 --> 00:09:32.858
I couldn't find a minute to
make an appearance over there.

160
00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:34.026
What did you do?

161
00:09:34.192 --> 00:09:36.570
Um, Saturday was
a crazy night for me.

162
00:09:39.615 --> 00:09:41.575
<i>I had some friends over,
we had a few drinks.</i>

163
00:09:41.742 --> 00:09:43.619
<i>That's Vag-tastic!</i>

164
00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:46.538
<i>I hung out in my basement,
the chill zone, Where we chill-lax.</i>

165
00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:49.374
<i>Like "relax" and "chill"
all at once.</i>

166
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:51.960
Seth's parents
were throwing this party.

167
00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:55.130
<i>We got to hang around adults,
which was a nice change of pace.</i>

168
00:09:55.297 --> 00:09:58.759
<i>You converse, you talk to people
and they have interesting stories.</i>

169
00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:02.638
<i>I talked to a man who claimed he had
climbed five mountains in his life.</i>

170
00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:04.389
- Wow.
- Then we went to a nightclub,

171
00:10:04.556 --> 00:10:06.266
which was incredible.
This big, fancy one.

172
00:10:06.433 --> 00:10:09.436
- Gonna look at tits right now!
<i>- "I'm feeling crazy." I said that.</i>

173
00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:11.897
<i>- You got in?
- We got right in.</i>

174
00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:13.899
- Wanna do this, 'roid monkey?
- Fuck you!

175
00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:16.693
<i>Then we called it a night.
We were all just really exhausted.</i>

176
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.446
Oh! What the fuck?!

177
00:10:19.613 --> 00:10:22.866
You would've loved it.
It was an incredible, unbelievable night.

178
00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:24.368
That sounds like a lot of fun.

179
00:10:24.534 --> 00:10:27.496
You know, I'd love to go do
something like that sometime.

180
00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:29.331
Oh, who wouldn't?
I mean, it was like

181
00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:32.709
me and Seth are always
kind of cooking up these

182
00:10:32.876 --> 00:10:35.545
fun sort of little,
you know, events.

183
00:10:35.712 --> 00:10:38.507
So I guess you guys are really
gonna go crazy next year together.

184
00:10:38.674 --> 00:10:41.426
Um, we were going to,
but we got into different schools.

185
00:10:41.593 --> 00:10:43.679
Really? That sucks.

186
00:10:44.012 --> 00:10:47.099
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad.
I mean, it should be okay.

187
00:10:47.265 --> 00:10:48.850
I'm not too worried
about it, really.

188
00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:51.687
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried at all.

189
00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:56.775
- All right, well, thank you for the pen.
- Yeah. No problem.

190
00:10:56.942 --> 00:10:59.861
- Bye.
- Bye.

191
00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:02.322
Bye, Evan.

192
00:11:02.489 --> 00:11:04.574
♪♪♪

193
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:14.710
Mrs. Hayworth, I joined this Class because
I thought I'd be cooking with a partner.

194
00:11:14.876 --> 00:11:18.463
But she's never here, and I don't get
twice the grades for doing all the work.

195
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.716
I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

196
00:11:20.882 --> 00:11:23.969
I know, but look at Evan, okay?
Just look at him.

197
00:11:24.136 --> 00:11:27.639
Hey, don't keep me waiting much longer.
I'm getting impatient up here.

198
00:11:27.806 --> 00:11:30.642
You know what I'm talking about.
Miroki, you're embarrassing me.

199
00:11:30.809 --> 00:11:34.229
I'm over here in my unit, isolated and
alone, eating my terrible-tasting food,

200
00:11:34.396 --> 00:11:35.897
and I gotta look over at that.

201
00:11:36.064 --> 00:11:38.316
Looks like the most fun I've
ever seen in my entire life.

202
00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:41.653
And it's B.S. Excuse my language.
I'm just saying that I wash and dry.

203
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.988
I'm like a single mother.

204
00:11:43.155 --> 00:11:45.157
Look, we all know Home EC
is a joke, no offense.

205
00:11:45.323 --> 00:11:48.744
Everyone takes this class to get an A.
It's bullshit, and I'm sorry.

206
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.913
I'm not putting down your profession,
but it's just the way I feel.

207
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.416
I don't wanna sit here all by
myself cooking this shitty food.

208
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:58.587
No offense. And I just think that
I don't ever need to cook tiramisu.

209
00:11:58.754 --> 00:12:00.505
When am I gonna need
to cook tiramisu?

210
00:12:00.672 --> 00:12:02.090
Am I gonna be a chef? No.

211
00:12:02.257 --> 00:12:05.260
There's three weeks left in school.
Give me a fucking break.

212
00:12:05.427 --> 00:12:07.637
I'm sorry for cursing.

213
00:12:08.805 --> 00:12:11.141
All right, Jules' partner
isn't here today either.

214
00:12:11.308 --> 00:12:12.768
Pair up with her. Station four.

215
00:12:13.477 --> 00:12:15.103
Jules?

216
00:12:16.354 --> 00:12:18.190
All right.
I'll give it another shot.

217
00:12:18.356 --> 00:12:20.400
I'll give Home EC another shot.

218
00:12:29.993 --> 00:12:32.245
Hey, Jules.
Your partner didn't come today?

219
00:12:33.121 --> 00:12:34.998
- That's kind of a personal question.
- What?

220
00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:38.668
Nothing. It's my attempt
at humor. I was just...

221
00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:40.670
Oh, like coming.

222
00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:42.923
Like "coming" coming.
Ahh.

223
00:12:44.466 --> 00:12:47.469
Wow, that was a little too far
right there. The gesture.

224
00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:50.555
Yeah. It's pretty far.
Shit, I do that...

225
00:12:50.722 --> 00:12:53.141
No, don't worry.
I'm actually used to it.

226
00:12:53.308 --> 00:12:55.936
My older brother says, like,
the nastiest shit.

227
00:12:56.103 --> 00:12:58.271
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

228
00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:00.982
- That's sick. That's not even clever.
- I know.

229
00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:02.192
I know.

230
00:13:02.359 --> 00:13:04.945
You know, I would've gone with something, you
know, at least, like, mildly entertaining.

231
00:13:05.112 --> 00:13:07.531
You know, like... Like...
Like "family Jules."

232
00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:12.160
Oh, like "nuts." Yeah, that's funny.
That's a fucking funny joke.

233
00:13:12.536 --> 00:13:14.538
Fucking funny.

234
00:13:15.122 --> 00:13:18.041
- I can't believe that.
- So all right. We gotta

235
00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:19.251
mix it up.

236
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.499
Yeah, Hayworth won't notice this,
if we cover it with chocolate.

237
00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:02.002
- The whole thing?
- Just dump it on. I'm serious.

238
00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:03.253
Okay.

239
00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:06.923
- And now it looks professional.
- That's really impressive.

240
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.092
- It's beautifully done.
- I think we're gonna get an A.

241
00:14:12.053 --> 00:14:14.139
So, what are you doing tonight?

242
00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:16.224
- Probably nothing. Why?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:18.727
My parents are out of town so I
was thinking about having a party.

244
00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:21.229
I don't really know how many
people are gonna be there,

245
00:14:21.396 --> 00:14:23.690
but you could stop by
if you wanted to.

246
00:14:24.232 --> 00:14:26.401
Yeah, I love parties.

247
00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:28.445
Really?

248
00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:31.156
I just don't really ever
see you at them.

249
00:14:31.323 --> 00:14:33.033
You know, it's a love-hate thing.

250
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.578
So, like, you know, right now,
I really love them, though.

251
00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:39.247
- Yeah.
- Good shit, right, Miroki?

252
00:14:39.414 --> 00:14:40.457
Mm. Mm-hm.

253
00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:41.750
Yeah.

254
00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:44.586
Hey, Miroki, could we have
a minute alone? Just... Thanks.

255
00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:47.339
Dude, Jules is having
a fucking party.

256
00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:48.924
Hey!

257
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.594
- Don't tell Fogell about the party.
- Gangsters. What's up, guys?

258
00:14:53.053 --> 00:14:56.139
I was just walking down the hall
and Nicola was right in front of me.

259
00:14:56.306 --> 00:14:59.267
She's wearing these tight white
pants with this black G-string

260
00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:02.520
and you could see right through the
pants, man. It was so sweet.

261
00:15:11.404 --> 00:15:12.572
Uh...

262
00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:15.033
It's 10:33.

263
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.870
What?

264
00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:22.207
I told her what time it was.

265
00:15:22.374 --> 00:15:25.377
That's the coolest fucking stow I've ever
heard in my entire life. That's insane.

266
00:15:25.543 --> 00:15:28.129
- Can I hear it again? You have time?
- Yeah, yeah, Seth.

267
00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:31.132
I'm really gonna miss your knee-slappers
when me and Evan are at Dartmouth.

268
00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:33.426
Well, while you guys are at
Dartmouth, I'll be over at State

269
00:15:33.593 --> 00:15:36.721
where the girls are half as smart and
thus twice as likely to fellash me.

270
00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:39.349
What are you guys
doing tonight? Asshole.

271
00:15:39.516 --> 00:15:41.726
We got nothing.
Nothing tonight, Fogell.

272
00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:44.813
No? Well, if nothing comes up,
we can get shitfaced again, yeah?

273
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.732
I mean, you're always calling me a pussy
and whatnot, but today you're wrong.

274
00:15:47.899 --> 00:15:50.402
At lunch, I'm going to the
same place Mike Snider went

275
00:15:50.568 --> 00:15:52.487
to pick up my brand-new fake ID.

276
00:15:52.654 --> 00:15:57.242
Chica, chica. Yeah.
Fake ID. Fake ID. I'm tight.

277
00:15:57.409 --> 00:15:59.494
That's insane. Because Evan was just
like, "I heard about this party."

278
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:02.497
We shouldn't tell Fogell about it." I
was like, "No, we should tell Fogell."

279
00:16:02.664 --> 00:16:05.375
That way you could buy us booze now.
It's awesome.

280
00:16:05.542 --> 00:16:09.045
Yeah, I'll... Sure, I'll buy the booze.
Yeah, man, we're gonna get our drinks on.

281
00:16:09.212 --> 00:16:11.756
We're gonna party and get
crunk and rock out, dude.

282
00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:14.009
If you're not in this
class, leave this Class.

283
00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:16.386
Fogell! Hi.

284
00:16:16.553 --> 00:16:17.637
Okay. Gotta go.

285
00:16:17.804 --> 00:16:19.848
Well done. Seriously.
See you after class.

286
00:16:20.307 --> 00:16:22.142
You tell that idiot you're not
rooming with him next year?

287
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:23.351
Not yet. No.

288
00:16:23.518 --> 00:16:26.271
All right, well, you better.
That guy's the fucking anti-poon.

289
00:16:26.438 --> 00:16:28.440
Seth, it's dishes time.
What's the holdup?

290
00:16:28.815 --> 00:16:30.900
We're getting a fake ID, so...

291
00:16:31.067 --> 00:16:33.903
- It's not like a big deal.
- Wow. That's cool.

292
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.239
But you guys have, like,
four more years to cuddle,

293
00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:37.824
so do you wanna get to work?

294
00:16:37.991 --> 00:16:40.410
Well, we got into
different schools, so...

295
00:16:40.577 --> 00:16:42.704
So you're cutting the cord?
What's gonna happen?

296
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:45.457
Nothing. Jeez, what does
everybody think is gonna happen?

297
00:16:45.623 --> 00:16:48.501
The world's gonna explode if we
don't spend every second together?

298
00:16:48.668 --> 00:16:51.087
I mean, we're not dependent
on each other, you know.

299
00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:53.673
It's like, we met when we were eight.
We were fine before then.

300
00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.676
I was. I mean, it's like,
we don't do everything together.

301
00:16:56.843 --> 00:17:00.513
No. All right, I gotta take a piss. My dick's
not gonna shake itself. Come on, babe.

302
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.474
Oh, yeah.

303
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.394
- He's a crack-up.
- I'm just gonna go.

304
00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:11.524
Well, at least we're
getting a graduation party.

305
00:17:11.691 --> 00:17:12.859
Thank God, man.

306
00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:14.069
Oh, I'm excited.

307
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.615
I would do terrible,
disgusting things to hook up with Jules.

308
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:20.575
- Unforgivable things.
- I hear you, man.

309
00:17:20.742 --> 00:17:22.911
I'd give my middle nut
to start dating Becca.

310
00:17:23.078 --> 00:17:24.996
Becca's a bitch.

311
00:17:25.163 --> 00:17:27.832
You know what? I'm seriously
getting fucking sick of you

312
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.502
talking about her like that, frankly,
if we can be honest with each other.

313
00:17:30.668 --> 00:17:32.337
- Me too.
- Why do you hate her so much?

314
00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:34.923
You've never given me a reason.
I think you like her.

315
00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:38.426
- Fuck no, man! I hate Becca.
- Why, man?

316
00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:41.096
Fine, Evan. Here it comes.

317
00:17:41.262 --> 00:17:44.099
When I was a little kid,
I kind of had this problem.

318
00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:45.934
And it's not even
that big of a deal.

319
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:48.853
Something like 8 percent of kids do
it, but whatever. It's...

320
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:55.527
For some reason, I don't know why,
I would just kind of sit around all day...

321
00:17:57.195 --> 00:17:59.030

bucks to feed myself for the week.

Just fucking listen, okay?

411
00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:46.567
Jules and her stupid fucking friend came up
to me and they asked me to buy her alcohol.

412
00:22:46.734 --> 00:22:49.696
But not just her, for her whole party.
You know what that means?

413
00:22:49.862 --> 00:22:53.074
By some divine miracle, we were paired
up and she actually thought of me.

414
00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:55.993
Thought of me enough to decide
that I was the guy she would trust

415
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.996
with the whole fun-ness of her party.
She wants to fuck me.

416
00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:01.999
She wants my dick
in or around her mouth.

417
00:23:02.166 --> 00:23:04.836
Did you ever think that maybe she's
just using you to get her alcohol?

418
00:23:05.002 --> 00:23:06.087
She doesn't want your dick.

419
00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:07.755
Yes, of course I thought of that.

420
00:23:07.922 --> 00:23:09.966
That's like the first thing that
came to my mind. Just listen.

421
00:23:10.133 --> 00:23:12.260
My older brother always says,
like, the nastiest shit.

422
00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:14.929
Like he called me "hymen"
until I was 12.

423
00:23:15.096 --> 00:23:16.639
Seth, I wanna blow you.

424
00:23:17.473 --> 00:23:18.766
Man, she didn't say that.
Come on.

425
00:23:18.933 --> 00:23:20.768
She didn't say the second part,
but the first part...

426
00:23:20.935 --> 00:23:22.979
She's got an older brother.
She could've asked him,

427
00:23:23.146 --> 00:23:25.148
but she asked me.
She looked me in the eyes and said:

428
00:23:25.314 --> 00:23:29.110
"Seth, mama's making a pubie salad.
I need some Seth's Own dressing."

429
00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:31.654
She's D.T.F. She's down
to fuck, man.

430
00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:34.532
P in vagi.
She wants to fuck, man.

431
00:23:34.699 --> 00:23:37.410
Tonight is the night that
fucking is an actual possibility.

432
00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:40.246
You just sound like an idiot. You're not
gonna be able to sleep with her, man.

433
00:23:40.413 --> 00:23:43.708
No. Dude, I know
I talk a lot of shit, okay?

434
00:23:43.875 --> 00:23:46.252
But she's gonna be at the
party and she's gonna be drunk.

435
00:23:46.419 --> 00:23:48.421
She likes me at least a little.
Enough to get with me.

436
00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:50.131
At the very least,
I'll make out with her.

437
00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:52.341
Two weeks, handjob.
Month, blowjob. Whatever.

438
00:23:52.508 --> 00:23:54.093
And then I make her my girlfriend.

439
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.262
And I've got, like,
two solid months of sex.

440
00:23:56.429 --> 00:23:58.055
By the time college rolls around,

441
00:23:58.222 --> 00:24:00.516
I'll be like the Iron Chef
of pounding vag.

442
00:24:00.683 --> 00:24:02.685
Can you get out of here and
we'll talk about this later?

443
00:24:02.852 --> 00:24:04.187
What the fuck, Evan?
We're down two points.

444
00:24:04.353 --> 00:24:06.189
Fucking calm down, Greg.
It's soccer.

445
00:24:06.355 --> 00:24:08.024
- It's soccer.
- Fuck you, man.

446
00:24:08.191 --> 00:24:10.443
Hey, Greg, why don't you
go piss your pants again?

447
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.196
- That was eight years ago, asshole.
- People don't forget.

the best part? Becca.

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:17.450
You do the same thing with her.

450
00:24:17.617 --> 00:24:19.744
When you guys are shitfaced at the
party, you get with her.

451
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:22.705
This is our last party
as high school people.

452
00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:25.792
I've fully ignored my hatred for
Becca in coming up with this plan.

453
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.795
I'm flexing nuts. Just fucking
come with me on this voyage,

454
00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:30.546
and just stop being
a pussy for once,

455
00:24:30.713 --> 00:24:33.800
and we can fucking
fuck some girls already.

456
00:24:34.342 --> 00:24:36.677
- I should buy Becca alcohol?
- Yeah, it'll be pimp.

457
00:24:36.844 --> 00:24:39.764
That way you know she'll be drunk.
You know when you hear girls saying:

458
00:24:39.931 --> 00:24:43.100
"Oh, I was so shitfaced last night.
I shouldn't have fucked that guy."

459
00:24:43.267 --> 00:24:44.685
We could be that mistake!

460
00:24:46.938 --> 00:24:48.272
Have you talked to Fogell?

461
00:24:48.439 --> 00:24:51.317
All right, you talk to Becca.
I'll talk to that retard, Fogell.

462
00:24:51.484 --> 00:24:52.527
Don't worry.

463
00:24:52.693 --> 00:24:54.612

464
00:24:54.779 --> 00:24:55.780
Goal.

465
00:24:55.947 --> 00:24:57.615
- You're getting that!
- No, I'm not!

466
00:25:01.536 --> 00:25:03.412
Hey, Becca. Hey, hold up.

467
00:25:03.579 --> 00:25:04.622
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, um...

468
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:07.208
Hi. Did you hear
about the party tonight?

469
00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:09.377
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.
It sounds awesome.

470
00:25:09.544 --> 00:25:11.546
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

471
00:25:11.712 --> 00:25:13.089
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go to it.

472
00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:14.841
That's actually why
I came looking for you.

473
00:25:15.007 --> 00:25:17.218
Me and the guys are gonna go
to a liquor store after class.

474
00:25:17.385 --> 00:25:18.970
And I just thought, you know,

475
00:25:19.136 --> 00:25:21.806
if you needed someone to get you
yours, I could do that.

476
00:25:21.973 --> 00:25:23.558
I could be that person.

477
00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:24.976
Yeah.

478
00:25:25.142 --> 00:25:26.686
Um, yeah, no, that would be great.

479
00:25:26.853 --> 00:25:30.231
That would save me such a hassle,
because I was gonna beg my sister.

480
00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:32.817
Could you get me, like,
a bottle of Goldslick Vodka?

481
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:35.611
Yeah. That's the one with the
little golden flakes in it?

482

we should be talking about right now.

645
00:34:38.028 --> 00:34:41.031
We put a lot of time into this list,
so don't fuck it up and get sambuca again.

646
00:34:41.198 --> 00:34:43.659
- It's perfect.
- Ouzo, bourbon,

647
00:34:43.826 --> 00:34:45.661
spiced rum, Goldslick...

648
00:34:45.828 --> 00:34:48.330
Goldslick Vodka. That's for Becca.
Don't forget that, okay?

649
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:51.291
Raspberry vodka, Scotch...

650
00:34:51.458 --> 00:34:53.210
Oh, and Kyle's Killer
Lemonade. A six-pack.

651
00:34:53.377 --> 00:34:56.380
This is a lot of stuff, man. I don't
know if I can get away with all this.

652
00:34:56.547 --> 00:34:58.048
What difference does
it make how much it is?

653
00:34:58.215 --> 00:35:01.510
I don't know, man.
I'm, like, really nervous.

654
00:35:02.094 --> 00:35:04.596
- Are you okay?
- No, man. I should have wore the vest.

655
00:35:04.763 --> 00:35:07.141
- Calm down.
- What the fuck are you doing?

656
00:35:07.307 --> 00:35:09.184
What if I go in there
and they turn me down, man?

657
00:35:09.351 --> 00:35:11.270
Then we're in the same exact
place we're in right now.

658
00:35:11.437 --> 00:35:13.188
- Who cares?
- It's fucking humiliating!

659
00:35:13.355 --> 00:35:15.190
Everybody in the store
sees them kicking me out.

660
00:35:15.357 --> 00:35:18.485
What if they make me put the liquor
back on the shelf? I can't do that.

661
00:35:18.652 --> 00:35:21.029
This whole thing
is bigger than you, Fogell!

662
00:35:21.196 --> 00:35:24.616
So grow a pair of nuts and fucking
walk in there and buy the alcohol!

663
00:35:25.117 --> 00:35:27.369
What if I don't feel like it
anymore, Seth? What?

664
00:35:27.536 --> 00:35:29.371
Then I'll fucking kill you, okay?

665
00:35:29.538 --> 00:35:31.540
I'll get a knife and stab you
through your fucking heart.

666
00:35:31.707 --> 00:35:33.208
No, you can do this, man.
Come on.

667
00:35:33.375 --> 00:35:36.295
Killing me won't get you alcohol,
jerk off. I'm the one with the fake ID.

668
00:35:36.462 --> 00:35:38.505
Then I'll cut
your dumb fucking face off

669
00:35:38.672 --> 00:35:41.800
throw it over mine and get your ID
and buy it my-fucking-self!

670
00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.887
Oh, really? You don't have the
technology or the steady hands

671
00:35:45.053 --> 00:35:47.055
to pull off a procedure
like that, so ha!

672
00:35:47.222 --> 00:35:48.724
Peace.

673
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:51.852
Fogell, just be cool, man.
Get in and get out.

674
00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:53.061
You're the hero.

675
00:35:55.856 --> 00:35:57.357
Sorry.

676
00:36:01.153 --> 00:36:03.238
♪♪♪

677
00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:29.097
Is there a problem here, sir?
Mm-mm.

678
00:36:29.264 --> 00:36:32.643
No. Mm-mm.
No problem whatsoever.

679
00:36:35.812 --> 00:36:38.524
Sir, did you do this?
On the floor?

680
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.192
No.

681
00:36:40.359 --> 00:36:42.027
And you should really clean this up.

682
00:36:42.194 --> 00:36:44.404
Someone could really
hurt themselves.

683
00:36:46.114 --> 00:36:48.033
Fuck my life.

684
00:36:48.617 --> 00:36:50.077
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

685
00:36:50.244 --> 00:36:52.120
This plan's been fucked
since <i>Jump Street,</i> man.

686
00:36:52.287 --> 00:36:54.915
Okay, just calm down.
Just calm down, all right?

687
00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:58.168
Hey, so did you bring
a condom for tonight?

688
00:36:58.335 --> 00:37:00.295
You brought a condom with you?

689
00:37:00.462 --> 00:37:02.381
Yeah. I figured
I might as well, you know?

690
00:37:02.548 --> 00:37:05.133
I brought a little bottle
of spermicidal lube too.

691
00:37:07.678 --> 00:37:10.472
But you laughed in my face when
I said I'd be having sex tonight.

692
00:37:10.639 --> 00:37:12.975
Yeah, that doesn't mean you
shouldn't always be prepared.

693
00:37:13.141 --> 00:37:15.477
- You didn't even bring a condom?
- No.

694
00:37:15.644 --> 00:37:17.479
No, Evan, that wasn't
part of the plan.

695
00:37:17.646 --> 00:37:19.731
I can't believe you did this
without consulting with me about it.

696
00:37:19.898 --> 00:37:23.610
Why are you talking about a plan? We've never discussed,
like, any plan, but you keep saying we have a plan.

697
00:37:23.777 --> 00:37:26.738
I had, like, a general outline.
You know?

698
00:37:26.905 --> 00:37:29.741
I was gonna go down on her
for, like, several hours, okay?

699
00:37:29.908 --> 00:37:32.828
She would love that. She'd be smitten
by that. She'd go out with that.

700
00:37:32.995 --> 00:37:34.746
Or I dry hump
the shit out of her leg.

701
00:37:34.913 --> 00:37:38.000
Okay. Well, I just... I don't see the
harm in bringing one little condom.

702
00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:40.335
And one little bottle
of spermicidal lube?

703
00:37:40.502 --> 00:37:42.963
Yeah, one little bottle
of spermicidal lube.

704
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.966
- Evan, that's psycho shit, man.
- No, it's not.

705
00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:47.801
That's, like, Charles Manson shit.

706
00:37:47.968 --> 00:37:51.096
What, do you think Becca's gonna be
psyched that you brought a bottle of lube?

707
00:37:51.263 --> 00:37:54.683
"Oh, Evan. Thank you for
bringing that lube for my pussy."

708
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.020
I never would've been able to
handle your fucking 4-inch dick

709
00:37:58.186 --> 00:38:01.315
"inside my pussy without
that gigantic bottle of lube."

710
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:03.150
- Okay, that's... That's enough.
- Fuck.

711
00:38:03.317 --> 00:38:05.986
These girls are 18 years old,
they're not dried-up old ladies.

712
00:38:06.153 --> 00:38:08.196
- They're good to go.
- Then I won't bring the lube.

713
00:38:08.363 --> 00:38:11.366
Don't make me feel like that.
I thought it was cool.

714
00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:13.869
- This is a nice kind.
- Let me see that for a second.

715
00:38:14.036 --> 00:38:16.079
- An impressive kind.
- It actually is kind of cool.

716
00:38:16.246 --> 00:38:17.998
- That's cool.
- Fucking dumb-ass. Lube?

717
00:38:18.165 --> 00:38:19.541
- That's fun.
- You brought lube?

718
00:38:19.708 --> 00:38:23.003
So you owe me 6 bucks because I'm not walking
over there to get it and it exploded.

719
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.840
Hello, Mindy.

720
00:38:39.519 --> 00:38:42.147
I love that stuff.
Been drinking it for years.

721
00:38:43.523 --> 00:38:47.861
You know, I heard they recently
decided to add more hops to it.

722
00:38:51.448 --> 00:38:53.367
Um, okay.

723
00:38:53.533 --> 00:38:56.036
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

724
00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.539
Really?

725
00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.958
Makes me feel young again.
Ha-ha. There you go.

726
00:39:04.586 --> 00:39:06.838
Oh, shit, it's Cary Hutchins.

727
00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:11.468
She had the biggest tits
I've ever seen, I think.

728
00:39:11.635 --> 00:39:13.512
I heard she got
breast-reduction surgery.

729
00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:15.389
What? Making your tits smaller?

730
00:39:15.555 --> 00:39:18.642
That's like slapping God across the
face for giving you a gorgeous gift.

731
00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:20.102
She had back problems, man.

732
00:39:20.268 --> 00:39:23.397
And it's not just making them smaller.
They completely reshape them.

733
00:39:23.563 --> 00:39:25.565
They make them more
supple and symmetrical.

734
00:39:26.274 --> 00:39:28.235
I gotta catch a glimpse
of these warlocks.

735
00:39:28.402 --> 00:39:29.986
Let's make a move.

736
00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.407
- She's going around the corner.
- Come on!

737
00:39:39.746 --> 00:39:42.749
Okay. Your total is 96.59.

738
00:39:52.634 --> 00:39:53.927
I don't believe it!

739
00:39:54.845 --> 00:39:56.930
Are you okay, mister?

740
00:39:57.681 --> 00:39:59.850
Ah! What the shit was that?

741
00:40:01.351 --> 00:40:04.438
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

742
00:40:05.897 --> 00:40:07.274
I don't believe it.

743
00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:09.818
I don't know, man. I think
she looked better before.

744
00:40:09.985 --> 00:40:13.196
But now that she can jog comfortably,
she's in the best shape she's ever...

745
00:40:13.363 --> 00:40:15.449
♪♪♪

746
00:40:16.783 --> 00:40:18.577
What is this? What's that?

747
00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:22.581
Oh, man.

748
00:40:27.794 --> 00:40:29.379
Holy shit, they busted Fogell.

749
00:40:30.464 --> 00:40:32.382
How did this happen, Evan?
Fuck, man!

750
00:40:32.549 --> 00:40:34.092
His dad's gonna fucking kill him.

751
00:40:34.259 --> 00:40:35.469
Look, okay?

752
00:40:35.635 --> 00:40:39.014
He assaulted the customer,
grabbed the cash and ran out.

753
00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:40.223
So...

754
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.058
- How...?
- How...? How...? How...?

755
00:40:42.225 --> 00:40:45.645
- Say when, height-wise.
- I'm gonna start up here, tell me when.

756
00:40:45.812 --> 00:40:48.106
- I'll start on the bottom and...
- When.

757
00:40:48.273 --> 00:40:50.317
Whatever 5'10 "is, he was 5'10".

758
00:40:50.484 --> 00:40:54.196
Ethnically, I mean, did...?
What...? Urn...

759
00:40:54.362 --> 00:40:58.992
I mean, was he...?
Was he like us, or...?

760
00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:01.661
A woman?

761
00:41:01.828 --> 00:41:02.871
- Female?
- No.

762
00:41:03.038 --> 00:41:05.540
- Is that what you're asking?
- No, no. Was he...?

763
00:41:05.707 --> 00:41:06.750
- Like, uh...
- What? What?

764
00:41:06.917 --> 00:41:07.959
- African?
- Af... Af...

765
00:41:08.126 --> 00:41:09.669
- Was he African?
- African.

766
00:41:09.836 --> 00:41:11.922
No. He was American,
and he was like you.

767
00:41:12.088 --> 00:41:15.008
- He looked just like you.
- He was Jewish. Okay, Jew.

768
00:41:15.175 --> 00:41:17.677
- It's an odd crime for a Jew.
- They're pretty docile.

769
00:41:17.844 --> 00:41:21.515
Okay, so we have an African
Jew wearing a hoodie.

770
00:41:21.723 --> 00:41:25.268
No, you don't. No. That's not what I said.
Is that what you heard me say?

771
00:41:25.435 --> 00:41:28.271
I said he looked like you.
Do you look like an African Jew?

772
00:41:29.105 --> 00:41:31.316
- No, I look like a cop.
- Yeah.

773
00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:34.861
He was Caucasian.

774
00:41:35.028 --> 00:41:36.780
- Caucasian.
- Oh. All right.

775
00:41:36.947 --> 00:41:37.989
- Okay.
- Well, touché.

776
00:41:38.156 --> 00:41:40.492
Kind of looked like Eminem.
Does that help you?

777
00:41:40.659 --> 00:41:41.701
- An M&M.
- An M&M.

778
00:41:41.868 --> 00:41:44.579
- So he was circular...?
- Marshall Mathers. Eminem?

779
00:41:44.746 --> 00:41:47.999
- The rapper, Eminem.
- Did he look like this?

780
00:41:48.416 --> 00:41:49.501
I'm an amateur. I kind of...

781
00:41:49.668 --> 00:41:51.044
Because that kind of
looks like an M&M.

782
00:41:51.211 --> 00:41:55.590
Longer face? Bigger nose?
Would you say his mouth was wider?

783
00:41:55.757 --> 00:41:57.175
Open? A gap?

784
00:41:57.342 --> 00:42:02.222
Is there another squad car that's in the area
that could probably be of further assistance?

785
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:04.057
I don't seem to be getting any.

786
00:42:04.224 --> 00:42:07.143
Okay, so just walk me through
again what this guy did.

787
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:10.438
He... He... He came in,
he's wielding...

788
00:42:10.605 --> 00:42:14.901
He's wielding something. He hits
this small gentleman in the slacks.

789
00:42:15.068 --> 00:42:18.113
And then he jumps over you,
he feels you up, violates you.

790
00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.948
- I did not say that.
- No, he doesn't.

791
00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:23.785
Look, I can't do this. I told you
already, I have an exam tomorrow.

792
00:42:23.952 --> 00:42:27.330
Can you understand that?
I have a goddamn veterinary exam!

793
00:42:28.874 --> 00:42:30.667
Goddamn it.
This is bullshit.

794
00:42:30.834 --> 00:42:33.587
This is some bullshit.
I got an exam tomorrow. Forget this.

795
00:42:33.753 --> 00:42:35.672
Well, apparently
someone has an exam.

796
00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:37.507
How'd you know?

797
00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:40.010
You. You're the one
that got punched?

798
00:42:40.176 --> 00:42:41.845
- Yeah.
- Okay.

799
00:42:42.012 --> 00:42:44.055
First things first.
What is your name?

800
00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:45.640
Uh...

801
00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:50.020
My name?

802
00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:54.024
It's M... McLov... McLovin.

803
00:42:54.608 --> 00:42:56.109
McLovin?

804
00:42:56.276 --> 00:42:58.570
Yeah. Mm-hm.

805
00:42:58.737 --> 00:43:00.238
Now, what's your first name?

806
00:43:00.405 --> 00:43:01.656
What?

807
00:43:01.823 --> 00:43:03.700
- Your first name?
- My first name?

808
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.623
Technically I don't have a first name,
so don't worry about my first name.

809
00:43:10.665 --> 00:43:12.876
But we're the police.

810
00:43:13.043 --> 00:43:14.878
We just wanna
get the story straight.

811
00:43:16.379 --> 00:43:17.589
- Come on.
- Fuck, man.

812
00:43:17.756 --> 00:43:20.216
- Come on!
- He must be so afraid.

813
00:43:20.383 --> 00:43:23.386
I don't believe this bullshit.
I can't believe this is happening!

814
00:43:23.553 --> 00:43:27.057
I didn't know you could get arrested
for this shit. We need that liquor.

815
00:43:27.223 --> 00:43:29.893
- Are they gonna take him downtown?
- Fuck Fogell.

816
00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.937
He got arrested, okay?
We're on our own.

817
00:43:32.103 --> 00:43:33.688
We need a new way to get liq...

818
00:43:33.855 --> 00:43:37.484
Fuck! The money, man! Fuck!
How much money can you get?

819
00:43:37.651 --> 00:43:39.861
Why are you talking about money, man?
What about Fogell?

820
00:43:40.028 --> 00:43:43.698
That doesn't matter anymore.
I lost a hundred dollars of Jules' money.

821
00:43:43.865 --> 00:43:47.494
What am I gonna do, bust him out of jail'?
I'm gonna bake him a cake with a fucking file in it?

822
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.748
Fuck Fogell. We need a new way to get liquor, which is
fucking impossible because we don't have any money.

823
00:43:51.915 --> 00:43:53.458
Fuck!
All right, you need to calm down.

824
00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:54.876
We need to think for a second.

825
00:43:55.043 --> 00:43:57.837
- We just need to think this out.
- Fuck thinking, we need to act!

826
00:43:59.965 --> 00:44:01.424
Whoa. Seth!

827
00:44:01.591 --> 00:44:04.427
- What the fuck happened?
- Just... Just get up. Slowly.

828
00:44:04.594 --> 00:44:07.430
You all right? You okay?

829
00:44:07.597 --> 00:44:10.558
I am so sorry, man.
I am so sorry.

830
00:44:10.725 --> 00:44:14.771
I didn't even effing see you at all, man.
Are you okay?

831
00:44:14.938 --> 00:44:18.358
So it's just McLovin?

832
00:44:18.525 --> 00:44:20.694
Yeah. Mm-hm.

833
00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.113
- That's badass.
- That is badass.

834
00:44:23.279 --> 00:44:24.531
- Really cool.
- A badass name.

835
00:44:24.698 --> 00:44:25.907
Lot of people with
weird names nowadays.

836
00:44:26.074 --> 00:44:27.450
Chingy. Shakira.

837
00:44:27.617 --> 00:44:29.077
Rafe. Pax.

838
00:44:29.244 --> 00:44:32.414
We arrested a man-lady
who was legally named "Fuck."

839
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.457
Think he was Vietnamese,
it was with a P-H.

840
00:44:34.624 --> 00:44:36.626
But it's still pretty
shocking to see on a license.

841
00:44:36.793 --> 00:44:40.380
- Okay, and how old are you, McLovin?
- Old enough.

842
00:44:41.756 --> 00:44:43.258
Old enough for what?

843
00:44:45.677 --> 00:44:47.637
To party.

844
00:44:51.933 --> 00:44:53.810
Can I see your ID?

845
00:44:54.352 --> 00:44:56.479
Yeah, I think I have it.

846
00:44:56.646 --> 00:44:58.732
♪♪♪

847
00:45:20.962 --> 00:45:24.174
- You're an organ donor.
- Bu-What?

848
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.967
I didn't wanna be one,
but my wife insisted.

849
00:45:26.134 --> 00:45:28.011
I always give him shit
for it too. All the time.

850
00:45:28.178 --> 00:45:31.264
I say, "It's just like a woman.
Even after you're dead",

851
00:45:31.431 --> 00:45:34.517
- ...they wanna tear your heart out."
- They wanna tear your heart out.

852
00:45:34.684 --> 00:45:37.520
- I say it weekly and it's still funny.
- It still makes me laugh.

853
00:45:37.687 --> 00:45:39.147
- Really funny.
- There you go.

854
00:45:39.314 --> 00:45:42.442
I'm sorry, guys.
I don't really have any information.

855
00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:45.195
He just kind of hit me, and I didn't
really see what he looked like.

856
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:47.781
- I don't know if I can help you.
- You in a hurry or something?

857
00:45:47.947 --> 00:45:50.033
Yeah, kind of had
to catch that bus.

858
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.912
- Where were you headed?
- Uh, near 13th and Granville.

859
00:45:54.704 --> 00:45:57.540
- We can take you there.
- Get your information on the way.

860
00:45:57.707 --> 00:46:00.001
- Why waste 2 bucks?
- We'll take you. No problem.

861
00:46:00.168 --> 00:46:03.838
Please don't report me, man. We can figure this
out, right? We can figure this out, right?

862
00:46:04.005 --> 00:46:06.633
Why the fuck wouldn't I report you?
You just hit me with your car.

863
00:46:08.676 --> 00:46:10.720
Because I'll do anything.

864
00:46:10.887 --> 00:46:13.431
Please, okay? Anything.
Like, literally,

865
00:46:13.598 --> 00:46:15.058
fucking anything.

866
00:46:15.225 --> 00:46:18.853
Name anything.
Name it. Name it.

867
00:46:19.896 --> 00:46:22.690
All right, look.
Hey, man. All right.

868
00:46:22.857 --> 00:46:24.359
Listen, you can trust me, okay?

869
00:46:24.526 --> 00:46:27.320
I'm gonna be
totally honest with you.

870
00:46:29.155 --> 00:46:31.616
I have a warrant out
for a totally nonviolent crime.

871
00:46:31.783 --> 00:46:35.537
Okay? There.
Mercy street, guys.

872
00:46:35.703 --> 00:46:37.455
Well, I'll be honest
with you for a second.

873
00:46:37.622 --> 00:46:39.874
You better get us a shitload of
cash or a shitload of alcohol

874
00:46:40.041 --> 00:46:41.751
or you're going to fucking prison.

875
00:46:41.918 --> 00:46:44.045
What are you doing, man?
You don't need to...

876
00:46:44.212 --> 00:46:46.131
No, let's not... Let's
hang on a second here.

877
00:46:46.297 --> 00:46:47.549
- Cough it up.
- Fine.

878
00:46:47.715 --> 00:46:49.551
I don't know if we should
be doing anything too official.

879
00:46:49.717 --> 00:46:52.679
Let's work together. We're working together.
It's like Let's Make a Deal. Here we go.

880
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.265
Seven bucks?

881
00:46:55.431 --> 00:46:58.226
Are you fucking serious? This isn't enough
for anything. What are you, a 6-year-old?

882
00:46:58.393 --> 00:47:02.063
- It's all I have, man. It's all I have.
- You better think of something quickly.

883
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:06.317
- Ah! My back! My back. Cops, my back.
- No, no, no. Wait, don't do that.

884
00:47:06.484 --> 00:47:08.778
All right, listen.
I can get you alcohol.

885
00:47:08.945 --> 00:47:11.156
I'm going over to this party
right now, bro. Okay?

886
00:47:11.322 --> 00:47:15.285
It's got booze, it's got girls.
Booze and girls equals...

887
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:17.704
I don't know. Do you?
I don't know. Do you?

888
00:47:17.871 --> 00:47:20.790
- I think you do. Do you?
- Yes. That's a definite yes.

889
00:47:20.957 --> 00:47:22.000
Definite yes, then.

890
00:47:22.167 --> 00:47:24.502
- Give me one see to talk to him.
- Stay right here.

891
00:47:24.711 --> 00:47:28.047
Yeah, yeah. Do what you gotta do. Mix it
over. I'll be over by the car. It's cool.

892
00:47:28.214 --> 00:47:31.176
Just talk it out.
Hey, I'm a nice guy.

893
00:47:31.968 --> 00:47:34.137
- Come on, it's great.
- What are you thinking, man?

894
00:47:34.304 --> 00:47:35.805
- What are you doing?
- What?

895
00:47:35.972 --> 00:47:38.433
I lost Jules' money,
Fogell's dead to us now,

896
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:40.101
we don't have any
other choices. Let's go.

897
00:47:40.268 --> 00:47:43.396
I don't like this idea. This guy's
fucking creepy, man. Look at him.

898
00:47:43.563 --> 00:47:46.357
What? He looks like a guy.
That's what guys look like.

899
00:47:46.524 --> 00:47:49.194
- What is your problem?
- You guys know a guy named Jimmy?

900
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.613
You totally look like his brother.

901
00:47:51.779 --> 00:47:54.282
You totally look
like his brother, man.

902
00:47:54.449 --> 00:47:56.034
You do.

903
00:47:57.702 --> 00:47:59.537
You promised Becca
you'd get her alcohol.

904
00:47:59.704 --> 00:48:01.706
If you don't, she's gonna
have a shitty night.

905
00:48:01.873 --> 00:48:03.791
That's all I'm saying.
Come on.

906
00:48:04.626 --> 00:48:06.628
We bingo, bango, ready to go, go?

907
00:48:07.212 --> 00:48:08.421
Good luck on
your exam tomorrow.

908
00:48:08.588 --> 00:48:09.797
Good luck on your exam.

909
00:48:09.964 --> 00:48:11.132
You don't wanna
ride the bus anyway.

910
00:48:11.299 --> 00:48:12.842
Buses smell like
piss, generally.

911
00:48:13.009 --> 00:48:14.052
- You know why?
- Why?

912
00:48:14.219 --> 00:48:15.261
People piss on them.

913
00:48:17.972 --> 00:48:20.058
♪♪♪

914
00:48:21.976 --> 00:48:26.981
You know, one of you bros could've
come up and sat up with me.

915
00:48:27.148 --> 00:48:28.858
- We're fine back here.
- Back's fine.

916
00:48:29.025 --> 00:48:30.985
Safe in the back seat.

00:48:32.862 --> 00:48:34.280
Oh!

920
00:48:39.661 --> 00:48:41.162
Seth. Hey, where are you?

921
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:44.832
I'm in a cab right now,
on the way to a liquor store.

00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:46.834
Okay, good. I can't wait
for you to get here.

Well, I hope your friends
are ready to get fucked up.

- Okay, I'll see you soon.
<i>- Peace.</i>

926

Oh, man! Dude, this is crazy.

927
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:00.473
She called, she said,
"I can't wait for you to get there."

928
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.643
That sounds like she fully wants
it, man. Oh, yeah.

929
00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.314
Who's gonna give it to her, huh, my man?
You, that's who.

930
00:49:08.481 --> 00:49:10.733
Man.

931
00:49:11.067 --> 00:49:12.777
You guys on MySpace, or...?

932
00:49:25.832 --> 00:49:27.542
- Um, officers?
- Hm?

933
00:49:27.709 --> 00:49:29.877
I can answer those questions
now if you want me to.

934
00:49:30.044 --> 00:49:33.131
We get the gist of it. You were
buying beer, some guys punched you.

935
00:49:33.298 --> 00:49:35.508
Don't worry about it.
We're not gonna find them.

936
00:49:35.675 --> 00:49:37.552
- Case closed.
- Um, but it was only...

937
00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:39.262
- Uh-oh.
- Whoop.

938
00:49:49.647 --> 00:49:52.650
- But it was only one guy.
- Only one guy? Shit.

939
00:49:52.817 --> 00:49:54.986
How am I supposed to find
one guy in the whole county?

940
00:49:55.153 --> 00:49:58.614
This job really isn't how, you know,
shows like CSI make it out to be.

941
00:49:58.781 --> 00:50:02.452
When I first joined the force,
I assumed there was semen on everything

942
00:50:02.618 --> 00:50:05.204
and there was some, like,
huge semen database

943
00:50:05.371 --> 00:50:08.333
that had every bad guy's semen in it.
There isn't. That doesn't exist.

944
00:50:08.708 --> 00:50:11.544
I often go to sleep and dream of
waking up in a world where

945
00:50:11.711 --> 00:50:14.172
- ...everything is covered in semen.
- I mean, who doesn't?

946
00:50:14.339 --> 00:50:16.132
It'd be nice.
Like that crime scene today.

947
00:50:16.299 --> 00:50:18.760
If the man had ejaculated and
then punched you in the face,

948
00:50:18.926 --> 00:50:20.428
we'd have a real good shot
at catching him.

949
00:50:20.595 --> 00:50:22.180
- No way.
- Just punched in the face, no semen.

950
00:50:22.347 --> 00:50:23.890
No semen.

951
00:50:24.057 --> 00:50:25.350
- Story of my life.
- Oh!

952
00:50:31.647 --> 00:50:34.734
Michaels here, he's six months in.

953
00:50:35.693 --> 00:50:38.154
He's young, but the Force
is strong with this one.

954
00:50:38.321 --> 00:50:40.740
Learning you
are, young padawan.

955
00:50:40.907 --> 00:50:42.533
Thank you very much.

956
00:50:43.785 --> 00:50:46.204
- That's Yoda.
- You familiar with Yoda?

957
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:47.872
From <i>Attack of the Clones?</i>

958
00:50:48.039 --> 00:50:52.168
<i>We have a 245 at East
24 and Montgomery, Bailey's Bar and Grill.</i>

959
00:50:52.335 --> 00:50:54.337
Car 98 on it.

960
00:50:54.504 --> 00:50:57.465
See, Michaels, you always
take a call at a bar because

961
00:50:57.632 --> 00:50:59.759
better or worse, you get
a beer out of it.

962
00:50:59.926 --> 00:51:01.719
- Wow.
- Pretty sweet, huh?

963
00:51:01.886 --> 00:51:04.055
- True that. Amazing thinking.
- Hey, McLovin.

964
00:51:04.222 --> 00:51:07.308
We got a situation at Bailey's,
so we'll drop you off after, all right?

965
00:51:07.475 --> 00:51:08.810
Actually, I kind of
have to be somewhere...

966
00:51:08.976 --> 00:51:10.603
Sweet. Sit tight.

967
00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.898
Set course for Bailey's Bar and Grill,
warp 10. Engage.

968
00:51:19.987 --> 00:51:24.450
Yeah.
Welcome to the Thunderdome.

969
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:29.288
Hey, man, are you sure it's
cool that we're here with you?

970
00:51:29.455 --> 00:51:30.832
Oh, definitely, man.

971
00:51:30.998 --> 00:51:33.000
I'm essentially
best friends with the guy,

972
00:51:33.167 --> 00:51:35.128
so a bunch of my buds are coming.

973
00:51:35.294 --> 00:51:38.131
Don't worry. We're gonna rock out
with our cocks out. Just kidding.

974
00:51:38.297 --> 00:51:41.092
- We are gonna rock out.
- Just go, just go.

975
00:51:41.259 --> 00:51:43.261
What's up?
What's up? What's up?

976
00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:46.931
Hello, hello. Hey, guys.

977
00:52:04.615 --> 00:52:06.784
This is something
a smart person wouldn't do.

978
00:52:06.951 --> 00:52:09.620
Look, just act cool and act
casual, and try and look old.

979
00:52:09.787 --> 00:52:12.498
We'll get the booze and get
the fuck out of here, okay?

980
00:52:16.502 --> 00:52:18.671
Hey, where the party at? Right.

981
00:52:18.838 --> 00:52:21.632
- You got those shots, bro?
- It's coming.

982
00:52:22.592 --> 00:52:24.135
Come on, let's party.

983
00:52:24.302 --> 00:52:27.722
Come on. Do it up.

984
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:35.771
We should just grab one of these
buckets and get out of here.

985
00:52:35.938 --> 00:52:38.983
Are you out of your mind? How are
we gonna get a fucking bucket out?

986
00:52:39.233 --> 00:52:40.818
Hey, man.

987
00:52:40.985 --> 00:52:42.820
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

988
00:52:42.987 --> 00:52:45.573
- What are you...? What? Nothing.
- You using my phone?

989
00:52:46.199 --> 00:52:49.869
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hang on. Nothing.

990
00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:51.913
What...? What...?
What's wrong, Mark?

991
00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:54.457
You weren't invited.
Get the fuck out of here.

992
00:52:54.624 --> 00:52:57.668
- Come on, Mark. It's cool, man.
- You using my fucking phone?

993
00:52:57.835 --> 00:52:59.670
You calling your fucking
friends again? Huh?

994
00:52:59.837 --> 00:53:02.173
You calling your friends,
your fantastic friends?

995
00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.550
No. I mean, yes.
But I mean I'll...

996
00:53:04.717 --> 00:53:07.136
Come on, man, just relax.
Mark, please.

997
00:53:07.303 --> 00:53:09.514
Get the fuck out of here.
The fuck out of my house.

998
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.182
Get the fuck out of my house.

999
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:14.519
- This is my house.
- Don't be such a dick, man!

1000
00:53:14.852 --> 00:53:16.312
What the fuck?

1001
00:53:16.479 --> 00:53:18.523
Mark! You really wanna
do this, man?

1002
00:53:18.689 --> 00:53:20.858
Here we 90.
We're really gonna do this?

1003
00:53:22.818 --> 00:53:24.654
That's right, motherfucker.

1004
00:53:25.738 --> 00:53:28.032
Come on, pussy.
Get up, dude.

1005
00:53:28.199 --> 00:53:29.450
Ooh!

1006
00:53:29.617 --> 00:53:31.744
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, bro.
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry, bro.

1007
00:53:31.911 --> 00:53:35.081
Tiger got out of the cage, man.
All right? I'm sorry. Come on, Mark.

1008
00:53:35.248 --> 00:53:37.458
Let's just chill.
Everyone just chill out.

1009
00:53:37.917 --> 00:53:39.377
Truce, man.

1010
00:53:42.713 --> 00:53:44.715
Right in the nads!

1011
00:53:47.134 --> 00:53:50.721
This is for your friends.
Here, have another one.

1012
00:53:50.888 --> 00:53:54.141
Shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
Oh, my God. What do we do?

1013
00:53:54.308 --> 00:53:56.060
- Come on. Come on.
- Choose one.

1014
00:53:57.103 --> 00:54:00.523
- We can slip out the back, man.
- Wait, wait. Come on.

1015
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:01.983
We're here. Let's
hurry up and do this.

1016
00:54:02.149 --> 00:54:04.277
Are you crazy, man?
Wanna end up like that guy?

1017
00:54:04.443 --> 00:54:07.071
Not me. I need my nuts,
man, for a lot of things.

1018
00:54:07.238 --> 00:54:08.990
- We need this liquor.
- No. You need it. I don't.

1019
00:54:09.156 --> 00:54:11.867
I'm just gonna tell Becca how I feel.
And then maybe she'll get with me.

1020
00:54:12.034 --> 00:54:14.370
I'm not gonna get her
drunk out of her mind.

1021
00:54:14.537 --> 00:54:17.331
Oh, really? Then how come you
never made a move, you pussy?

1022
00:54:17.498 --> 00:54:20.918
Because I respect her, Seth. I'm not gonna
put that kind of unfair pressure on her.

1023
00:54:21.085 --> 00:54:23.087
Come on, I don't see a problem.
Let's just do it.

1024
00:54:23.254 --> 00:54:26.007
We're leaving, okay? These guys could kill
us, man. You wanna get killed for liquor?

1025
00:54:26.173 --> 00:54:29.510
No, but I would get killed for
pussy, no questions asked.

1026
00:54:29.677 --> 00:54:32.847
- Fuck this, man.
- You're just gonna bail on me?

1027
00:54:33.014 --> 00:54:35.933
- I'm going.
- Fucking bitch.

1028
00:54:36.475 --> 00:54:38.811
Move, people.

1029
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:43.441
- Thank you.
- Oh, I love this place.

1030
00:54:52.617 --> 00:54:54.285
What the hell is going on in there?

1031
00:54:54.452 --> 00:54:56.704
If the bullets start flying,
hit the deck.

1032
00:54:56.871 --> 00:54:59.123
You pissed everywhere,
you son of a bitch!

1033
00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.543
Everywhere?
You didn't see me pissing anywhere.

1034
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:04.462
Sir, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1035
00:55:04.629 --> 00:55:06.380
Take your nuts out of your shells!

1036
00:55:06.547 --> 00:55:08.174
All right, Michaels,
I got your back.

1037
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:10.301
Why don't you show
this rummy how we roll?

1038
00:55:10.468 --> 00:55:11.802
10-4.

1039
00:55:12.345 --> 00:55:15.389
Excuse me, sir.
Stop what you are doing at once.

1040
00:55:15.556 --> 00:55:19.810
- Ah! Blue guys!
- Resisting. Resisting!

1041
00:55:19.977 --> 00:55:21.604
- Slater!
- Michaels!

1042
00:55:22.021 --> 00:55:23.314
Everybody stay calm.

1043
00:55:25.149 --> 00:55:28.319
- Everybody stay calm.
- Get the fuck out of my way!

1044
00:55:28.694 --> 00:55:30.488
Stay calm! Fuck!

1045
00:55:31.405 --> 00:55:33.324
- Should I shoot him?
- No, no, no!

1046
00:55:33.491 --> 00:55:35.826
- No!
- Stop him, McLovin!

1047
00:55:35.993 --> 00:55:38.245
McLovin, stop him!
Do it, do it, do it, do it!

1048
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:46.504
Please stop it, you fucking bum.
What the fuck?

1049
00:56:01.185 --> 00:56:04.188
McLovin! Nice!

1050
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:06.691
He just came at me.
I took him down.

1051
00:56:06.857 --> 00:56:08.567
I'm buying you a beer, McLovin.

1052
00:56:08.734 --> 00:56:09.902
I'm buying you one too.
All you guys,

1053
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:12.196
take note. That's how
you take down a motherfucker.

1054
00:56:12.363 --> 00:56:13.739
That's right.

1055
00:56:13.906 --> 00:56:16.534
McLovin in the fucking house!

1056
00:56:51.235 --> 00:56:55.614
Hey.
You dance hot.

1057
00:56:56.532 --> 00:56:58.242
Thank you.

1058
00:57:14.049 --> 00:57:17.887
Okay, okay.

00:57:28.898 --> 00:57:30.941
- Hello? What?

1064
00:57:31.108 --> 00:57:33.527
Guy sells me

1065
00:57:33.694 --> 00:57:35.154

- It's Becca.

1066

00:57:44.246 --> 00:57:46.957
- That's rude. Hello?

Thanks.

This is fucking crazy.

1076
00:58:51.438 --> 00:58:54.275
Hey. Look what
fell out of the truck!

1077
00:58:56.527 --> 00:58:58.028
You're full of shit.

1078
00:58:58.195 --> 00:59:00.155
Yeah, I know.

1079
00:59:00.823 --> 00:59:05.452
Dude. Dude.
We're so gonna get fucked up.

1080
00:59:05.619 --> 00:59:07.997
- All right.

1081
00:59:08.497 --> 00:59:11.333
What is that? Uh...

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.168
I don't know. What?

1083
00:59:13.335 --> 00:59:17.089
That fucking stain on your pants, idiot.
What is that?

1084
00:59:17.548 --> 00:59:19.717
- What are you talking about, man?
- Dude.

1085
00:59:20.593 --> 00:59:23.053
- Is that blood?
- What the fuck is that?

1086
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.222
- Are you bleeding?
- I'm not cut or anything.

1087
00:59:25.389 --> 00:59:28.142
- Why would I be bleeding?
- It's fucking blood, man.

1088
00:59:29.268 --> 00:59:31.979
Were you dancing
with some chick in there?

1089
00:59:32.521 --> 00:59:34.773
- Yeah, so?
- It's blood.

1090
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.527
- Dude, that's not funny.
- It's blood, dude.

1091
00:59:38.694 --> 00:59:42.239
But Why would I be bleeding?
Why the fuck would I be bl...?

00:59:42.406 --> 00:59:44.241
Dude, Why would there be bl...?

1093
00:59:46.493 --> 00:59:49.496
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God.

1094
00:59:51.665 --> 00:59:55.085
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna fucking throw up.

1095
00:59:55.252 --> 00:59:56.837
Someone perioded on my fucking leg?

1096
00:59:57.004 --> 00:59:59.089
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck do I do?

1097
00:59:59.256 --> 01:00:01.550
I've never before
seen that in my life!

1098
01:00:01.717 --> 01:00:03.427
This is so disgusting.

1099
01:00:03.594 --> 01:00:05.095
- Yes, it is.
- I'm gonna go get Bill.

1100
01:00:05.262 --> 01:00:06.847
- He's gotta Check this shit out.
- Fuck, yeah.

1101
01:00:07.014 --> 01:00:10.267
No. Who's Bill? Don't tell Bill!
Bill has nothing to do with this!

1102
01:00:10.434 --> 01:00:13.020
Hey, calm down, calm down.
Let me get a picture of that real quick.

1103
01:00:13.187 --> 01:00:14.563
No, you can't have a picture!

1104
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.607
- Dude, stop!
- Bill, Bill! Check it out!

1105
01:00:16.774 --> 01:00:18.734
This kid's got period blood
on his slacks.

1106
01:00:18.901 --> 01:00:20.736
It's merlot.
That's what you don't get.

1107
01:00:20.903 --> 01:00:23.572
Hey, Pat! This jerk-off's
got period blood on his pants!

1108
01:00:23.739 --> 01:00:25.741
- Please stop.
- God, man, let me see.

1109
01:00:25.908 --> 01:00:28.869
Oh, my God,
that's a fucking man-gina, man.

1110
01:00:29.036 --> 01:00:32.456
- Do you need a tampon? I could...
- Wait, wait. I have one! I have one!

1111
01:00:33.123 --> 01:00:35.125
Yeah, right? I don't know.

1112
01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:37.002
- I gotta wash this merlot off.
- Is this the line?

1113
01:00:37.169 --> 01:00:38.379
What does it look like?

1114
01:00:38.545 --> 01:00:40.255
Fuck me, right?

1115
01:00:55.479 --> 01:00:57.231
Uh, yeah, I'm McLovin.
I'd like to buy some...

1116
01:00:57.398 --> 01:00:58.983
Oh!

1117
01:01:00.401 --> 01:01:01.819
Shit.

1118
01:01:01.986 --> 01:01:04.321
- Rewind, rewind.
- Rewind it. Yeah!

1119
01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:07.658
So hot. Let's see it again.
- Oh!

1120
01:01:08.993 --> 01:01:10.536
- Your legs lifted off the ground.
- Oh, my God.

1121
01:01:10.703 --> 01:01:12.454
That is bona fide badass, man.

1122
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:14.999
You gotta keep that tape, McLovin.
It is badass.

1123
01:01:15.165 --> 01:01:16.500
- It really is.
- Really?

1124
01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:19.503
Well, don't you guys, like,
need it for, like, evidence or...?

1125
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.881
The only thing that's evidence of
is you can take a hit like a champ.

1126
01:01:23.048 --> 01:01:24.800
Seriously. Take that.

1127
01:01:24.967 --> 01:01:29.596
Are there any ladies we'd
like to show this tape to?

1128
01:01:30.347 --> 01:01:33.892
No. You don't wanna meet a chick
in a bar, man. Seriously.

1129
01:01:34.059 --> 01:01:36.729
That was a major turning point
in my life, when I realized that.

1130
01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:41.150
You gotta go to other places. You gotta
go to a spin class, a farmers' market,

1131
01:01:41.316 --> 01:01:44.028
pumpkin patch,
given the time of year.

1132
01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:46.697
Just somewhere social,
non-threatening.

1133
01:01:46.864 --> 01:01:50.159
- You know, something like that.
- Yeah, I met the missus at paintball.

1134
01:01:50.325 --> 01:01:53.328
Yeah, I shot her in the neck.
And we just...

1135
01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:55.372
And we just hit it off, you know.

1136
01:01:55.539 --> 01:01:59.043
My first wife... Who is a
whore, by the way.

1137
01:01:59.209 --> 01:02:00.544
...Where do you think I met her?

1138
01:02:00.711 --> 01:02:03.589
A bar. A bar.

1139
01:02:03.756 --> 01:02:05.799
- It was this bar.
- It was this bar.

1140
01:02:05.966 --> 01:02:08.177
Yeah, it was this bar.

1141
01:02:08.385 --> 01:02:12.139
Bought her a Binion's,
complimented her on her tote bag,

1142
01:02:12.306 --> 01:02:17.227
and next thing I know, she's putting
her mouth around the tip of my penis.

1143
01:02:17.978 --> 01:02:20.064
You don't have to tell me that.

1144
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:23.025
- Right in there.
- She opened up my world, sexually.

1145
01:02:23.192 --> 01:02:25.611
On our wedding night,
we had group sex.

1146
01:02:25.778 --> 01:02:27.196
I wasn't involved in it.

1147
01:02:27.362 --> 01:02:29.907
- But I could hear it through the wall.
- I was.

1148
01:02:30.074 --> 01:02:33.118
She was amazing.
And then it was exactly 23 months later

1149
01:02:33.285 --> 01:02:35.370
that I found out that
she was an actual whore.

1150
01:02:35.537 --> 01:02:37.539
- We discovered her on the street.
- Yeah.

1151
01:02:37.706 --> 01:02:39.166
I'm sorry.

1152
01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.585
She was bad.
Fucking whoring bitch.

1153
01:02:41.752 --> 01:02:45.255
- But you got a new wife now, so...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1154
01:02:45.422 --> 01:02:47.758
And she is wonderful.

1155
01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:49.927
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You'll meet her.

1156
01:02:50.094 --> 01:02:52.179
You know what?
I bet I know your trick, McLovin.

1157
01:02:52.346 --> 01:02:53.347
You play the whole myst...

1158
01:02:53.514 --> 01:02:54.807
<i>Calling all units.</i>

1159
01:02:54.973 --> 01:02:56.642
Just turn that off.

1160
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:58.602
<i>Send backup!
There '3 so much blood...!</i>

1161
01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:03.774
I bet you play the whole
mysterious-guy thing, right?

1162
01:03:04.566 --> 01:03:07.778
Yeah, seriously.
How's it going with the ladies?

1163
01:03:08.028 --> 01:03:12.116
It's not the going with the ladies
I care about,

1164
01:03:12.282 --> 01:03:15.119
it's the coming.

1165
01:03:16.954 --> 01:03:18.956
- I get it.
- What is it? What is it?

1166
01:03:19.123 --> 01:03:20.457
Like:

1167
01:03:20.624 --> 01:03:22.292
Like coming.

1168
01:03:25.129 --> 01:03:29.424
- That's funny. That is really funny.
- Oh, my God.

1169
01:03:32.219 --> 01:03:33.470
Whoo!

1170
01:03:34.847 --> 01:03:37.599
All right, looks like we got a call.
We can't pay for these.

1171
01:03:37.766 --> 01:03:39.101
10-4. We'll be right there.

1172
01:03:39.268 --> 01:03:41.937
- Speedy Gonzales, let's go.
- We should get road beers, huh?

1173
01:03:42.437 --> 01:03:44.439
Hell, yeah, we should
get some road beers.

1174
01:03:44.606 --> 01:03:46.817
Can I have 13 beers to go, please?

1175
01:03:46.984 --> 01:03:50.237
Please. God, my fucking leg.

1176
01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.290
♪♪♪

1177
01:04:06.461 --> 01:04:08.172
Fuck.

1178
01:04:34.364 --> 01:04:36.742
- I think it's him. Shh.
- Oh, is it him?

1179
01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:38.202
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Becca.</i>

1180
01:04:38.368 --> 01:04:42.122
Hi, I had a bad reception.
So, um, about your Goldslick...

1181
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:45.042
- Guys, shut up.
- Hey, what's going on over there?

1182
01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:47.294
Oh, it's nothing. It's just...

1183
01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:50.380
Um, I was just calling, you know,
to see if you were coming

1184
01:04:50.547 --> 01:04:53.800
because I thought maybe you were stuck
at, like, a nightclub

1185
01:04:53.967 --> 01:04:56.553
or a cocktail party or something.

1186
01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.015
No, no, I'm gonna be there for sure.
Full throttle.

1187
01:05:00.182 --> 01:05:01.892
<i>- Charlie's Angels 2.
- Awesome.</i>

1188
01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:06.104
<i>- I can't wait to see you. Evan?</i>
- Okay, bye.

1189
01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:09.608
That was the first time I ever did
coke. Off that bitch's nipple. That was so...

1190
01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:11.693
- A little White sniff.
- That was awesome.

1191
01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.903
That was gorgeous.

1192
01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:16.365
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys, stay in this room, man.

1193
01:05:16.531 --> 01:05:19.743
They're gonna kill that guy tonight.
That Chick's boyfriend is pissed.

1194
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:21.495
Yeah. He's a beast.

1195
01:05:21.662 --> 01:05:24.748
I've been praying for a fight. I'm literally
waking up every morning and praying...

1196
01:05:24.915 --> 01:05:26.875
...to see a fucking fight.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1197
01:05:29.086 --> 01:05:30.254
Who's that guy?

1198
01:05:35.259 --> 01:05:36.301
- Who is that guy?
- Hi.

1199
01:05:36.468 --> 01:05:38.553
- Who's this guy?
- Pleasure to see you fellas.

1200
01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.805
Hi, everyone.

1201
01:05:39.972 --> 01:05:41.682
- Who are you?
- I'm nobody.

1202
01:05:41.848 --> 01:05:43.433
No, no, no. I know you.
I know you.

1203
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.978
He was at that party with me.
The one I was telling you about.

1204
01:05:46.144 --> 01:05:47.271
- No, no.
- Who is it?

1205
01:05:47.437 --> 01:05:50.607
Remember? He's Jimmy's brother.
The guy. The singer.

1206
01:05:50.983 --> 01:05:52.025
- No shit.
- He's the guy

1207
01:05:52.192 --> 01:05:53.735
with the beautiful voice
I was telling you about.

1208
01:05:53.902 --> 01:05:56.196
- The fucking singer, Jimmy's brother!
- That's not me, man.

1209
01:05:56.363 --> 01:05:58.115
- Oh, my God.
- Sing for us! Sing.

1210
01:05:58.282 --> 01:05:59.783
Oh, "It's not me"?
You fucking lying?

1211
01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:03.120
No, I don't mean to accuse you
guys of being ill-informed, but...

1212
01:06:03.287 --> 01:06:05.664
My brother came from Scottsdale,
Arizona to be here tonight.

1213
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.249
And you're not gonna sing for him?

1214
01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:08.625
- Fucking bullshit.
- Sing.

1215
01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:10.961
- You're a fucking singer.
- You sing. And you sing good.

1216
01:06:11.128 --> 01:06:12.629
- Sing it again.
- Like a bird.

1217
01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:15.507
- No, I know, I just... I want to.
- You want a line of cocaine?

1218
01:06:15.674 --> 01:06:16.800
- No way, man.
- Yeah.

1219
01:06:16.967 --> 01:06:19.177
Don't make this weird. Sing.

1220
01:06:19.344 --> 01:06:21.555
- Sing it again.
- Turbo.

1221
01:06:25.892 --> 01:06:27.978
- Fuck! Over!
- Okay, watch this.

1222
01:06:28.145 --> 01:06:30.981
I'll get it right on the nose.

1223
01:06:31.148 --> 01:06:33.108
You're gonna fuck it up.
You're gonna fuck it up.

1224
01:06:33.275 --> 01:06:34.318
Under!

1225
01:06:35.986 --> 01:06:37.863
I feel hammered.
That doesn't make any sense.

1226
01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:40.657
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Okay, okay. Great, great.

1227
01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:44.328
- Okay, McLovin, see if you can do it.
- The kid's gonna nail it.

1228
01:06:44.494 --> 01:06:47.414
Come on, McLovin.
Do it, buddy. Come on, buddy!

1229
01:06:47.581 --> 01:06:50.208
- Bring it!
- 0.08, motherfuckers!

1230
01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:53.086
- Man!
- That's my boy!

1231
01:06:53.462 --> 01:06:55.422
- Yes!
- Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.

1232
01:06:56.256 --> 01:06:59.092
So, What's it like to have guns?

1233
01:06:59.259 --> 01:07:02.012
It is awesome, McLovin.

1234
01:07:02.179 --> 01:07:03.847
- I mean, it's mindbl...
- It's great.

1235
01:07:04.014 --> 01:07:06.808
I haven't had one for long,
only a few months, but I'll tell you

1236
01:07:06.975 --> 01:07:08.769
- it's like having two cocks.
- Yup.

1237
01:07:08.935 --> 01:07:11.104
If one of your cocks
could kill someone.

1238
01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:15.484
- Can I hold one?
- What?

1239
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:16.985
Can I hold one of your guns?

1240
01:07:20.197 --> 01:07:23.325
- Yeah, sure.
- Fine with me. Why not?

1241
01:07:23.492 --> 01:07:25.827
Everyone should hold a gun
at least a couple times.

1242
01:07:25.994 --> 01:07:27.454
Yeah, there you go.

1243
01:07:27.621 --> 01:07:29.998
- Have a blast.
- "Have a blast."

1244
01:07:30.165 --> 01:07:34.378
- That's funny.
- I've never held one of these before.

1245
01:07:34.544 --> 01:07:37.297
- Are they hard to shoot?
- Uh, if you're Michaels, they are.

1246
01:07:37.464 --> 01:07:39.216
- He can't shoot worth dick.
- What?

1247
01:07:39.383 --> 01:07:40.884
I can shoot. What are you...? Wait.

1248
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:42.511
You honestly saying
I can't shoot worth dick?

1249
01:07:42.677 --> 01:07:44.596
- You cannot shoot.
- I shot that cat last week.

1250
01:07:44.763 --> 01:07:46.056
It was already dead, man.

1251
01:07:46.223 --> 01:07:47.808
- I still shot it.
- That cat was dead.

1252
01:07:47.974 --> 01:07:49.893
There's only one way
to settle this, guys.

1253
01:07:50.394 --> 01:07:51.937
- Shoot-off.
- Shoot-off.

1254
01:07:52.104 --> 01:07:53.647
- Shoot-off!
- Shoot-off!

1255
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:56.942
Dude, there's a lot of
reasons why I like you.

1256
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:59.444
I mean, you're handsome
and you're a good friend.

1257
01:07:59.611 --> 01:08:03.657
Dude, there he is. That's the guy.
Hey, Mark, right there.

1258
01:08:05.409 --> 01:08:06.576
Oh, you got a stain too.

1259
01:08:08.328 --> 01:08:10.580
- We're blood brothers.
- Shut the fuck up.

1260
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:13.333
You're in my house,
you answer my questions.

1261
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.460
What were you doing
dancing with Jacinda?

1262
01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:19.423
I don't even dance. I just...

1263
01:08:19.589 --> 01:08:22.175
I don't even dance ever, so...
I've never even tried it.

1264
01:08:22.342 --> 01:08:25.011
Then where the hell did this
come from, asshole?

1265
01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:29.015
Maybe you and I rubbed up against
each other at some point in time.

1266
01:08:29.182 --> 01:08:32.185
I don't remember. Or maybe it was some
sort of ricochet scenario. I don't know.

1267
01:08:32.352 --> 01:08:34.438
- How am I supposed to know?
- Kick his ass, Mark.

1268
01:08:34.604 --> 01:08:36.398
Shut the fuck up, Scarlett.

1269
01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:39.943
Where do you get off
dancing with my fiancee?

1270
01:08:48.368 --> 01:08:49.453
To some girl.

1271
01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:04.176
Talk about the hurting.

1272
01:09:14.394 --> 01:09:15.854
- AW, Shit.
- All right.

1273
01:09:38.793 --> 01:09:40.504
- Yo! Fight!
- Move it!

1274
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.422
- Go, check this out!
- Oh, fuck!

1275
01:09:42.589 --> 01:09:44.591
And what the hell is this?

1276
01:09:45.091 --> 01:09:48.428
- I don't fucking... It's detergent.
- Yeah, what are you doing with it?

1277
01:09:50.138 --> 01:09:51.973
I got fucking blood on my pants.

1278
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:54.726
Get down.

1279
01:09:56.937 --> 01:09:59.397
What the fuck is this all about,
man? Are you...?

1280
01:10:00.398 --> 01:10:03.777
- Well, fuck me.
- Fellas.

1281
01:10:04.277 --> 01:10:07.280
Oh, shit,
I've been tackled by little girls!

1282
01:10:07.447 --> 01:10:08.615
You die! You're next!

1283
01:10:11.284 --> 01:10:16.122
I should fucking kill you,
you motherfucker!

1284
01:10:16.289 --> 01:10:17.832
Hold him, Jimmy's brother!

1285
01:10:17.999 --> 01:10:20.293
- Hold him!
- What do you mean? No. No way!

1286
01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.212
- You humiliated me!
- I'm sorry!

1287
01:10:22.379 --> 01:10:25.966
- You used my leg as a tampon!
- I'm calling the cops.

1288
01:10:26.132 --> 01:10:30.887
Evan! Come on! Move!

1289
01:10:31.096 --> 01:10:33.765
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1290
01:10:33.932 --> 01:10:38.144
Yeah. Fifth and Paysview.
Hurry.

1291
01:10:38.311 --> 01:10:41.064
Mark, I called the cops.
You should hide your gun.

1292
01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:42.899
You're a fucking pussy.

1293
01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:44.317
Don't listen to him, officer.

1294
01:10:44.484 --> 01:10:46.361
If you make this,
we're no longer friends, Michaels.

1295
01:10:46.528 --> 01:10:47.779
Shh. Cheating.

1296
01:10:47.946 --> 01:10:49.614
- You're a fucking pussy.
- You're cheating.

1297
01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:55.412
- Fuck me.
- Oh, suck on my nuts, Slater!

1298
01:10:55.579 --> 01:10:57.455
All right,
you... That was a lucky shot.

1299
01:10:57.622 --> 01:11:00.834
- That was a lucky shot.
- I rule.

1300
01:11:01.001 --> 01:11:02.252
I got jizzed on.
All right.

1301
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.504
- Can I shoot one?
- Yeah, go nuts. Go nuts.

1302
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:06.172
Have a good time, man.

1303
01:11:06.339 --> 01:11:08.091
Empty the clip.
Empty the clip on it, man.

1304
01:11:09.509 --> 01:11:10.594
Shit!
The cops!

1305
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.471
Bail! Bail! Bail!
Shotgun, shotgun! Damn it!

1306
01:11:14.848 --> 01:11:16.266
Shotgun.

1307
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:28.236
- What a rush.
- What do you guys wanna do?

1308
01:11:28.403 --> 01:11:30.864
- Man, let's get drunk!
- Let's get more fucked up!

1309
01:11:31.031 --> 01:11:33.158
You're fucking
living the dream, Michaels!

1310
01:11:33.325 --> 01:11:34.367
Oh, man.

1311
01:11:34.534 --> 01:11:36.286
This is gonna be
the best night ever.

1312
01:11:36.453 --> 01:11:38.121
<i>Got a 257 at Fifth and Paysview.</i>

1313
01:11:38.288 --> 01:11:39.331
AW, Shit.

1314
01:11:39.497 --> 01:11:41.499
<i>All units in the area report
to Fifth and Paysview.</i>

1315
01:11:41.666 --> 01:11:44.002
<i>- Car 98, that's you. Do it.</i>
- Fuck.

1316
01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:46.254
- Shit.
- Shit.

1317
01:11:46.421 --> 01:11:49.716
Car 98 on it.
You dumb fucking whore.

1318
01:11:49.883 --> 01:11:52.927
Hey, did she say we're gonna get
to shoot somebody or something?

1319
01:11:53.094 --> 01:11:54.429
Oh, God, I Wish.

1320
01:11:54.638 --> 01:11:58.058
It's probably some lame house party.
We'll drop you off after. Cool?

1321
01:11:58.224 --> 01:12:00.560
Yeah, man. Let's show
these fuckers how we roll!

1322
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:18.870
- You fucking prick.
- What?

1323
01:12:21.748 --> 01:12:25.752
- You bailed on me.
- I didn't bail on you.

1324
01:12:25.919 --> 01:12:28.004
Yeah, you did.

1325
01:12:28.171 --> 01:12:31.049
You said you were gonna do
something and you didn't do it.

1326
01:12:31.216 --> 01:12:32.384
That's bailing.

1327
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.804
You're the one that dragged me to that
fucking party with those lunatics.

1328
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:40.975
- I didn't bail on you.
- You bailed on me, okay?

1329
01:12:41.142 --> 01:12:43.603
You bailed on me this morning
when Jesse spat on me,

1330
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:45.480
and you're bailing on me next year.

1331
01:12:45.647 --> 01:12:48.692
What the fuck? It finally comes out.
That's good, man.

1332
01:12:48.858 --> 01:12:50.819
We were supposed to go
to college together, Evan.

1333
01:12:51.027 --> 01:12:53.113
Since we were little kids,
since elementary school,

1334
01:12:53.279 --> 01:12:55.782
that's all we've ever talked about,
was us going to college together.

1335
01:12:55.949 --> 01:12:57.659
And you got into fucking Dartmouth.

1336
01:12:57.826 --> 01:12:59.786
You're making me feel
like I'm a bad guy.

1337
01:12:59.953 --> 01:13:02.956
What...? I didn't do anything wrong.
I got into a good school.

1338
01:13:03.665 --> 01:13:06.876
How the fuck am I supposed to get
into Dartmouth? You knew I couldn't.

1339
01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:08.586
How fucking selfish are you?

1340
01:13:08.753 --> 01:13:10.797
You had no problem letting
Fogell take the fall back there.

1341
01:13:10.964 --> 01:13:12.966
You obviously don't want me
going to a good school.

1342
01:13:13.133 --> 01:13:14.926
- Fuck, man!
- So what the fuck do you want?

1343
01:13:15.093 --> 01:13:17.929
I'm not gonna let you slow
me down anymore, Seth.

1344
01:13:21.057 --> 01:13:22.142
What are you saying?

1345
01:13:22.851 --> 01:13:26.604
I've wasted the last three years of my life
sitting around talking bullshit with you.

1346
01:13:26.771 --> 01:13:28.773
Instead of chasing girls
and making friends,

1347
01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.985
I've just sat around wasting
all my time with you.

1348
01:13:32.152 --> 01:13:34.779
And now because of you I'm going to
college a fucking friendless virgin.

1349
01:13:34.988 --> 01:13:38.491
Is this about Becca?
This is about some girl, man?

1350
01:13:38.658 --> 01:13:40.118
- I like her!
- Who gives a fuck?

1351
01:13:40.285 --> 01:13:42.495
She's some fucking girl!
You gonna go out with her for two years?

1352
01:13:42.662 --> 01:13:45.165
- What about after that?
- Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.

1353
01:13:45.665 --> 01:13:48.460
Fuck you! And next time you're
pissed off about something,

1354
01:13:48.626 --> 01:13:51.463
don't keep it inside for 10
years, say it like a fucking man!

1355
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:53.089
- Don't touch me.
- Fuck you!

1356
01:13:55.175 --> 01:13:58.136
Hey, McLovin, are the
numbers on your side odd or even?

1357
01:13:58.303 --> 01:14:02.056
- I don't know. It's too dark to see.
- We got flashlights.

1358
01:14:02.223 --> 01:14:04.017
Oh, that's true.

1359
01:14:05.769 --> 01:14:07.187
Bing.

1360
01:14:09.689 --> 01:14:11.608
Where the fuck are we?

1361
01:14:12.233 --> 01:14:13.443
- Hey, Slater.
- What's that?

1362
01:14:15.028 --> 01:14:16.279
Slater.

1363
01:14:19.783 --> 01:14:23.453
Now, young Michaels, you will die.

1364
01:14:24.996 --> 01:14:26.664
All right. Come on, stop it.
I can't fucking see.

1365
01:14:26.831 --> 01:14:28.374
You can't see?
No, I can't see. Fuck it.

1366
01:14:28.541 --> 01:14:30.376
- How do you like it?
- Hey, fuck off, that hurts.

1367
01:14:30.543 --> 01:14:32.295
- You stop first.
- Not until you stop.

1368
01:14:32.462 --> 01:14:34.130
- Stop it, asshole.
- Hey, you stop.

1369
01:14:35.173 --> 01:14:37.592
- Fuck you, Evan!
- Don't fucking touch me.

1370
01:14:49.103 --> 01:14:50.271
Why did you do that?

1371
01:14:50.438 --> 01:14:52.649
- You shined a light in my face.
- You shined a light in my face.

1372
01:14:52.816 --> 01:14:54.901
- I'm driving.
- We were playing Lightsabers.

1373
01:14:55.068 --> 01:14:56.986
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

1374
01:14:57.153 --> 01:15:00.573
Are you guys gonna
make sure he's okay?

1375
01:15:02.909 --> 01:15:04.619
- Go out there and check on him.
- You Check.

1376
01:15:04.786 --> 01:15:07.872
- You go out there and check on him.
- Fuck that. You go.

1377
01:15:08.039 --> 01:15:12.418
Balls. Okay, we'll both go
out there and check on him.

1378
01:15:13.837 --> 01:15:16.756
I can't believe this is happening again.
What are the odds?

1379
01:15:17.799 --> 01:15:19.425
Fuck.

1380
01:15:22.887 --> 01:15:26.641
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah, we're great, thanks.

1381
01:15:26.808 --> 01:15:31.312
Hey, hey, where's the love?

1382
01:15:31.479 --> 01:15:35.984
- He's okay. He's fine.
- Stand right next to your friend.

1383
01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.027
- Get over there.
- I got them.

1384
01:15:38.194 --> 01:15:39.529
You got these guys?

1385
01:15:46.327 --> 01:15:48.204
You boys doing
a bit of drinking tonight?

1386
01:15:48.371 --> 01:15:52.542
- No, officer. Not at all. Not... We...
- We found those.

1387
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:53.877
I don't believe you.

1388
01:15:57.547 --> 01:15:59.716
Freeze. Stand right there.

1389
01:15:59.883 --> 01:16:02.051
- We're telling the truth.
- Yeah. Keep it going.

1390
01:16:02.218 --> 01:16:04.512
- Don't be a hero tonight, guys.
- Wrong night for that.

1391
01:16:04.762 --> 01:16:06.598
This is your fault.
You gotta fucking take care of this.

1392
01:16:06.764 --> 01:16:10.643
No. Look, I am not fixing your
mistakes again, okay? Fuck that shit.

1393
01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:13.104
I don't wanna get shitcanned.
I happen to like this job.

1394
01:16:13.271 --> 01:16:15.607
I like this job too. I get free haircuts.
I'm not taking the fall.

1395
01:16:15.773 --> 01:16:17.442
Okay, okay!

1396
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:20.612
We're gonna arrest
these two little dipshits, okay?

1397
01:16:20.778 --> 01:16:22.530
And we're gonna pin it on them.

1398
01:16:23.156 --> 01:16:24.657
Yeah, do what you have to do.

1399
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.165
Spread your shit!

1400
01:16:32.332 --> 01:16:35.418
Get on the ground!
Loaded gun, ready to go!

1401
01:16:35.585 --> 01:16:38.212
Spread your shit!
Pussies on the pavement, fellas.

1402
01:16:38.379 --> 01:16:40.632
- Come on!
- Please don't shoot, sir.

1403
01:16:40.798 --> 01:16:43.426
"Please don't shoot."
Shut up and spread your shit!

1404
01:16:44.969 --> 01:16:47.889
I am the law! Okay?

1405
01:16:48.056 --> 01:16:49.223
Now hold hands.

1406
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.808
- What?
- Why?

1407
01:16:50.975 --> 01:16:54.646
Because you don't want an asshole where
your face used to be, Whaling Jennings.

1408
01:16:54.812 --> 01:16:57.231
- Hold his fucking hand!
- Fucking hold my hand.

1409
01:16:57.398 --> 01:16:59.817
There.
That's not so hard, is it?

1410
01:16:59.984 --> 01:17:02.445
Here, McLovin,
have a Cigarette.

1411
01:17:03.655 --> 01:17:05.448
Smoke up.
Life's short, you know.

1412
01:17:06.157 --> 01:17:08.201
Suck it in, my friend.

1413
01:17:08.368 --> 01:17:10.995
Suck it long and deep.

1414
01:17:11.162 --> 01:17:12.664
Enjoy it.

Thanks. We really
like you too, McLovin.

So here's what's about to happen.

1419

We're gonna arrest these two guys,

you're gonna write a witness report saying
they leapt out in front of our car like madmen

1421
01:17:33.226 --> 01:17:35.603
and there was nothing we could do
to avoid hitting them. Sound cool?

1422
01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:39.774
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.

1423
01:17:39.941 --> 01:17:42.276
That's good.
Pretend he's your little sister.

01:19:55.243 --> 01:19:57.120
Ow! What the fuck?

1449
01:20:02.834 --> 01:20:05.336
Michaels, are you okay?

1450
01:20:05.503 --> 01:20:07.338
- It's just beer.
- Oh, give me a break.

1451
01:20:07.505 --> 01:20:09.132
- It's just beer.
- Man up.

1452
01:20:09.298 --> 01:20:10.925
What happened?
What, did you lose him?

1453
01:20:11.092 --> 01:20:13.886
He's a freak.
He's the fastest kid alive.

1454
01:20:14.053 --> 01:20:16.639
- This is not good.
- He's the fastest kid alive.

1455
01:20:16.848 --> 01:20:19.350
Fastest kid alive, my ass.
Come on. What are we gonna do?

1456
01:20:20.184 --> 01:20:21.394
I'll shoot my gun in the air.

1457
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:24.272
Give me a fucking warning
before you do it.

1458
01:20:24.438 --> 01:20:26.274
I'll scare him
out of wherever he's hiding.

1459
01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.525
This isn't gonna do shit.

1460
01:20:27.692 --> 01:20:29.443
Shh. Shh.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

1461
01:20:29.610 --> 01:20:30.820
This is your fault, you piece of...

1462
01:20:32.238 --> 01:20:34.282
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
They shot Seth.

1463
01:20:34.448 --> 01:20:36.617
They fucking shot Seth, I know it.

1464
01:20:36.909 --> 01:20:37.994
Holy shit.

1465
01:20:39.412 --> 01:20:41.205
Holy shit.
Ah!

1466
01:20:41.372 --> 01:20:43.416
- Should I run?
- Yes.

1467
01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.338
- Fuck. Stop!
- Stop the bus!

1468
01:20:49.505 --> 01:20:50.965
- Stop it!
- It's stopping.

1469
01:20:51.132 --> 01:20:53.342
- It's stopping.
- Oh, thank God.

1470
01:20:56.053 --> 01:20:58.347
Hey, Evan, pay for me, please.

1471
01:21:00.641 --> 01:21:01.684
That's me and him.

1472
01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:06.314
Hey, hey. It's you.

1473
01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:07.732
McMuffin.

1474
01:21:08.107 --> 01:21:09.525
- You know this guy?
- It's...

1475
01:21:09.692 --> 01:21:13.738
Ain't got no cop people to help
you keep your booze now, do you?

1476
01:21:13.905 --> 01:21:17.283
Hey! Back the fuck up, man,
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

1477
01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.577
- Give me the booze.
<i>- Hey! Back the fuck up.</i>

1478
01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:22.955
<i>Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.</i>

1479
01:21:23.122 --> 01:21:24.832
Please, please,
calm down, sir.

1480
01:21:33.966 --> 01:21:39.347
Goldslick.

1481
01:21:50.775 --> 01:21:52.902
Get off the bus
or I'm calling the cops.

1482
01:21:59.575 --> 01:22:01.661
Eat shit, bum.

1483
01:22:01.994 --> 01:22:04.872
Oh, shit, guys.
We're three blocks away, man. We made it.

1484
01:22:05.039 --> 01:22:06.749
We made it with the
booze and everything.

1485
01:22:06.916 --> 01:22:08.292
We made it.

1486
01:22:08.459 --> 01:22:09.919
Hold this.

1487
01:22:10.628 --> 01:22:13.172
I can't believe
you still have the liquor.

1488
01:22:14.173 --> 01:22:15.299
That's awesome.

1489
01:22:15.466 --> 01:22:18.552
Yeah, I told you the idea
would work. I fooled those cops.

1490
01:22:18.761 --> 01:22:21.764
I'm McLovin. Whoo!
I am McLovin.

1491
01:22:23.599 --> 01:22:25.017
Why do you guys have detergent?

1492
01:22:25.184 --> 01:22:28.187
I don't understand why you were
smoking cigarettes with those cops.

1493
01:22:28.354 --> 01:22:30.022
Because I fucking rule.

1494
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:33.526
- We are so gonna get laid tonight.
- I am. I'm gonna get laid.

1495
01:22:33.693 --> 01:22:37.196
We're finally gonna get
our drinks on. Chica, chica, yeah.

1496
01:22:38.281 --> 01:22:39.991
I can't believe
Becca's bottle broke.

1497
01:22:40.157 --> 01:22:41.575
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1498
01:22:41.742 --> 01:22:44.662
I thought you didn't need it anyway.
You were gonna tell her how you feel.

1499
01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:47.415
Good luck getting Jules drunk
enough to have sex with you.

1500
01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:49.542
- What's wrong with you guys?
- Nothing.

1501
01:22:49.709 --> 01:22:52.920
You two femmes can talk about it next
year at your little slumber party.

1502
01:22:53.087 --> 01:22:54.839
Oh, you told him.

1503
01:22:55.006 --> 01:22:57.675
- Told me what?
- Yeah. You're an idiot, Fogell.

1504
01:22:57.842 --> 01:22:59.677
- Well, we gotta tell him now.
- No, we...

1505
01:22:59.844 --> 01:23:01.345
Well, he knows something's up.

1506
01:23:01.512 --> 01:23:03.848
What are you guys talking about?
Tell me now.

1507
01:23:04.015 --> 01:23:06.225
Seth, me and Evan are rooming
together next year at college.

1508
01:23:06.392 --> 01:23:07.435
What's the big deal?

1509
01:23:07.601 --> 01:23:09.562
"Oh, my God,
Fogell's rooming with Evan."

1510
01:23:09.729 --> 01:23:11.480
Jeez, why don't you
go cry about it?

1511
01:23:11.647 --> 01:23:14.066
- I didn't tell you because...
- Because you're a backstabber

1512
01:23:14.233 --> 01:23:17.778
and you lied to your best friend and only want to
hang out with Fogell and you just don't care anymore?

1513
01:23:17.945 --> 01:23:19.947
I didn't expect this
from you, Evan.

1514
01:23:20.364 --> 01:23:21.574
Not from you.

1515
01:23:21.741 --> 01:23:23.993
Give me that booze, Fagell.

1516
01:23:27.538 --> 01:23:30.541
We never should have had
to hide our arrangement.

1517
01:23:40.676 --> 01:23:43.054
- Seth's here.
- Seth, you're here.

1518
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.223
Hi. Everybody, Seth has got it.

1519
01:24:10.206 --> 01:24:12.375
- Evan.
- Gaby, hey.

1520
01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:14.418
Where have you been?
You almost blew it.

1521
01:24:14.585 --> 01:24:17.171
- What are you talking about?
- Becca. She's been waiting for you.

1522
01:24:17.338 --> 01:24:18.672
She's over there.

1523
01:24:19.507 --> 01:24:20.841
She's way smashed.

1524
01:24:21.008 --> 01:24:23.344
And she's been yammering
about you all night.

1525
01:24:23.511 --> 01:24:25.346
Really? What was she saying?

1526
01:24:25.513 --> 01:24:27.640
She told you that she thinks
I'm a good guy?

1527
01:24:27.807 --> 01:24:30.434
No, no. She said
something more like:

1528
01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:33.145
"I willfully blow him tonight."

1529
01:24:33.354 --> 01:24:35.731
- What?
- I know.

1530
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:41.404
- Yeah.
- But she's totally hammered,

1531
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:44.490
and if I get with her and I'm not
drunk, isn't that unethical?

1532
01:24:44.657 --> 01:24:46.742
Oh. Not if you're drunk too.

1533
01:24:48.035 --> 01:24:49.453
I guess not.

1534
01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:50.955
To Seth.

1535
01:24:51.122 --> 01:24:53.374
- To Seth!
- All right.

1536
01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:55.459
Who the fuck is Seth?

1537
01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:56.794
I'm Seth!

1538
01:24:59.046 --> 01:25:01.298
Let's do another one to me.

1539
01:25:12.309 --> 01:25:13.936
Oh, boy.

1540
01:25:14.645 --> 01:25:16.730
Calm down.
Calm down, man.

1541
01:25:16.897 --> 01:25:18.983
Calm down.
She likes you.

1542
01:25:19.316 --> 01:25:21.610
She wants to suck on your penis.

1543
01:25:21.819 --> 01:25:23.487
It's a good thing.

1544
01:25:23.654 --> 01:25:27.324
It's the best thing.

1545
01:25:28.117 --> 01:25:29.827
Just down the hatch.

1546
01:25:57.605 --> 01:25:59.523
Fogell. What's up?

1547
01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:48.822
Evan, hey. Evie, come here.

1548
01:26:48.989 --> 01:26:50.407
Can you please help me up?

1549
01:26:50.574 --> 01:26:54.203
I fell down and none of these
assholes will help me up.

1550
01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:56.956
- Shit.
- Becca.

1551
01:26:57.122 --> 01:26:59.250
I have been waiting for you
for, like, ever.

1552
01:26:59.416 --> 01:27:01.418
- What took you so long?
- I know, it...

1553
01:27:01.585 --> 01:27:04.088
- No, I can't even...
- Do you have my Goldslick?

1554
01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:05.923
It's such a crazy stow, okay?

1555
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.426
- I swear I was try...
- It doesn't even matter.

1556
01:27:09.593 --> 01:27:12.137
Look. Look what we...
We can just drink this.

1557
01:27:12.304 --> 01:27:14.598
- Here. You could have a drink.
- Oh, no.

1558
01:27:14.765 --> 01:27:16.809
- I'm already pretty wasted.
- Take a drink.

1559
01:27:16.976 --> 01:27:19.395
Okay, here's to you.
This is to Becca.

1560
01:27:19.562 --> 01:27:20.688
To Becca.

1561
01:27:20.854 --> 01:27:23.232
- To the respecting...
- Guys.

1562
01:27:23.399 --> 01:27:26.485
...Women. To people
respecting women.

1563
01:27:26.652 --> 01:27:29.697
Okay. Yeah.

1564
01:27:32.116 --> 01:27:33.367
You're a lightweight.

1565
01:27:34.702 --> 01:27:36.120
Hey.

1566
01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:40.416
You and me,
we should go upstairs, because...

1567
01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:44.753
Because I need to
tell you something. Okay?

1568
01:27:45.296 --> 01:27:47.464
You could just tell me
here, I mean...

1569
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:52.428
I can't tell you, because
it's a secret for you from me.

1570
01:27:52.595 --> 01:27:54.680
- All right.
- So come. Come on. Okay.

1571
01:27:54.847 --> 01:27:56.056
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

1572
01:27:56.223 --> 01:27:58.475
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1573
01:28:03.856 --> 01:28:08.235
You changed your name
to McLovin? Wow.

1574
01:28:08.986 --> 01:28:11.655
- That's so cool.
- Thanks.

1575
01:28:11.822 --> 01:28:15.743
Hm?
So, like, what's Hawaii like?

1576
01:28:16.368 --> 01:28:17.786
All right. I am back.

1577
01:28:17.953 --> 01:28:20.247
I had to thank the peeps
for coming out, you know.

1578
01:28:20.414 --> 01:28:22.958
Jules. I want you
to have a drink with me.

1579
01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.502
Just drink some of this.
You're gonna love it.

1580
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:27.504
You're to...
I know you're gonna love it.

1581
01:28:27.671 --> 01:28:31.300
You know, I...
It's green beer. For your information.

1582
01:28:31.467 --> 01:28:34.136
You know, I'm actually good
right now. But thank you.

1583
01:28:34.553 --> 01:28:37.848
And thank you very much for
bringing everything, again.

1584
01:28:38.015 --> 01:28:39.683
Seriously, it really
made the night.

1585
01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:42.645
No, that's how I roll.
That's the thing.

1586
01:28:42.811 --> 01:28:45.689
It's no problems.
You'll learn that.

1587
01:28:51.445 --> 01:28:56.116
I love talking
and conversing with you.

1588
01:28:56.283 --> 01:28:59.328
But I can't hear you, though,
because the music is so loud.

1589
01:28:59.495 --> 01:29:02.706
So do you wanna go outside
and talk more?

1590
01:29:03.082 --> 01:29:04.667
Um...

1591
01:29:05.542 --> 01:29:08.212
Yeah. Sorry, sure.
You know, why not?

1592
01:29:08.379 --> 01:29:10.381
Let's do it.
I haven't conversed in ages.

1593
01:29:10.547 --> 01:29:14.051
- Okay. Ladies... Ladies first.
- Okay.

1594
01:29:15.052 --> 01:29:17.054
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

1595
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.682
- Watch your step. I fell earlier today.
- Are you serious?

1596
01:29:19.848 --> 01:29:21.975
Well, I was hit by a car.
It's a long story.

1597
01:29:22.518 --> 01:29:26.271
- Oh, shit. Careful.
- Okay, well...

1598
01:29:27.356 --> 01:29:30.567
So loud. Don't let
the parents hear.

1599
01:29:31.193 --> 01:29:33.070
You look so pretty.

1600
01:29:36.365 --> 01:29:40.577
- Are you okay?
- I so flirt with you in math.

1601
01:29:40.744 --> 01:29:42.913
Tell me about it. I... Samesies.

1602
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.669
I've wanted to tell you for so
long that you're the best girl.

1603
01:29:48.836 --> 01:29:53.757
I know. I've wanted to get with
you, like, so hard.

1604
01:29:55.342 --> 01:29:57.720
Like so hard.

1605
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.561
You're the best.

1606
01:30:05.728 --> 01:30:09.273
We'll take this sweater off.
I think so.

1607
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.735
Just be careful, because it's a
meaningful sweater to me. It's vintage.

1608
01:30:12.901 --> 01:30:13.986
Okay.

1609
01:30:14.695 --> 01:30:17.614
- Bought it at that vintage market.
- Just hurry.

1610
01:30:18.073 --> 01:30:20.617
- And this one.
- It's off.

1611
01:30:20.784 --> 01:30:22.953
Hey, wait, careful.

1612
01:30:24.079 --> 01:30:25.622
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

1613
01:30:25.789 --> 01:30:27.040
Put that there.

1614
01:30:27.207 --> 01:30:28.959
- Now, looky, looky...
- Oh, my gosh.

1615
01:30:29.126 --> 01:30:31.712
What I got for you under here.

1616
01:30:31.879 --> 01:30:33.714
You are the prettiest girl

1617
01:30:33.881 --> 01:30:36.800
this side of the Mississippi.
I have a little something

1618
01:30:36.967 --> 01:30:39.887
for you under here.

1619
01:30:40.053 --> 01:30:41.138
You look so pretty.

1620
01:30:41.555 --> 01:30:43.891
- Look so pretty.
- Under there.

1621
01:30:44.057 --> 01:30:45.934
Hello.

1622
01:30:47.144 --> 01:30:49.229
For you.

1623
01:30:53.817 --> 01:30:58.280
You're the best. You're so unique.

1624
01:30:58.447 --> 01:30:59.948
Come here.

1625
01:31:00.115 --> 01:31:02.493
Evan, kiss me.

1626
01:31:02.785 --> 01:31:04.620
I like you so much.

1627
01:31:05.662 --> 01:31:07.539
Come on, McLovin.

1628
01:31:07.706 --> 01:31:09.583
I've never been
with an older guy before.

1629
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:13.128
Well, it's way better.

1630
01:31:13.295 --> 01:31:15.506
I know, we made some
kick-ass tiramisu earlier.

1631
01:31:15.672 --> 01:31:19.259
It was deli... It looked weird.
But it was delicious.

1632
01:31:22.387 --> 01:31:23.889
Whoa.

1633
01:31:24.056 --> 01:31:26.975
What...? What's wrong?

1634
01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:31.188
I... I would prefer
if we would just do that

1635
01:31:31.355 --> 01:31:34.942
at some other time.

1636
01:31:35.108 --> 01:31:38.195
No. There is no other time.
School is up.

1637
01:31:38.362 --> 01:31:42.699
- What's wrong with right now?
- Well, I mean, you're... You're drunk.

1638
01:31:43.367 --> 01:31:47.287
- You're, like, really, really drunk.
- So? You're drunk. You're drunk, Jules.

1639
01:31:47.454 --> 01:31:50.457
Yeah, I'm actually...
I'm not drunk at all.

1640
01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:53.210
I don't even drink, so it's...
I mean...

1641
01:31:54.419 --> 01:31:57.548
Jules, you drink. You drink.

1642
01:31:57.714 --> 01:32:00.551
Everybody... You... You had me
get liquor, so you drink.

1643
01:32:00.717 --> 01:32:01.802
It's like...

1644
01:32:01.969 --> 01:32:05.347
Well, yeah, because
I'm throwing a party, remember?

1645
01:32:05.514 --> 01:32:07.140
Other people drink and so I just...

1646
01:32:07.307 --> 01:32:08.851
You...?

1647
01:32:10.185 --> 01:32:13.564
You don't wanna, you know?

1648
01:32:15.315 --> 01:32:18.277
Not, uh, right now.

1649
01:32:18.443 --> 01:32:21.572
You know, not while you're drunk.

1650
01:32:22.155 --> 01:32:24.199
But, you know, thank you.

1651
01:32:29.496 --> 01:32:34.084
- Evan. Evan, I'm so wet.
- Oh, yeah.

1652
01:32:34.251 --> 01:32:37.588
They said that would happen in
health, when I learned about it.

1653
01:32:37.754 --> 01:32:39.590
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1654
01:32:39.756 --> 01:32:42.926
- They taught me about... Oh!
- Who's down there?

1655
01:32:43.093 --> 01:32:44.386
Yeah, it's your hand.

1656
01:32:45.846 --> 01:32:47.681
Ah-ha-ha.

1657
01:32:49.266 --> 01:32:52.644
- Thank you, that's good.
- You have such a smooth cock.

1658
01:32:52.811 --> 01:32:54.897
Thank you.
You would too if you were a man.

1659
01:32:55.063 --> 01:32:57.608
But you got such a smooth chest.

1660
01:32:57.774 --> 01:33:00.444
I am gonna give you

1661
01:33:00.611 --> 01:33:05.115
the best blow-J ever

1662
01:33:05.282 --> 01:33:07.701
with my mouth.

1663
01:33:07.868 --> 01:33:10.120
Why don't we...?
Why don't we just kiss a while?

1664
01:33:10.287 --> 01:33:13.916
Why don't we keep kissing for a
bit, instead of...?

1665
01:33:15.792 --> 01:33:17.377
How badly do you wanna fuck me?

1666
01:33:17.794 --> 01:33:19.463
Jesus Christ.

1667
01:33:20.213 --> 01:33:21.256
Jesus, fuck.

1668
01:33:21.423 --> 01:33:22.716
- Hang on, one second.
- What?

1669
01:33:22.883 --> 01:33:24.635
Becca, I don't think
you wanna do this.

1670
01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:28.764
- You're really drunk.
- No, I'm not. I am not drunk.

1671
01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:33.143
- I see that you are. I think you are.
- And I really... I want you inside me.

1672
01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:35.562
I want you to be my first.
I want you inside me.

1673
01:33:35.729 --> 01:33:37.981
So just... Just go with it.

1674
01:33:38.148 --> 01:33:40.108
- Let it happen.
- I know, but...

1675
01:33:40.567 --> 01:33:42.611
Becca, this is kind of intense.

1676
01:33:42.778 --> 01:33:47.157
And I just... I'm so drunk.
I can't even, like, process this.

1677
01:33:47.324 --> 01:33:49.660
And, um, you're really pretty.

1678
01:33:49.826 --> 01:33:51.954
And I just think
this isn't how I pictured it.

1679
01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:56.583
I don't understand why you have to
be such a little bitch about it.

1680
01:33:57.751 --> 01:34:00.921
- Did you just call me a bitch?
- Yes, a scared...

1681
01:34:01.088 --> 01:34:03.715
See, I, like, I think
we're not thinking clear...

1682
01:34:03.882 --> 01:34:05.175
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1683
01:34:05.342 --> 01:34:07.761
- Go get Gaby.
- I'll go get her.

1684
01:34:07.928 --> 01:34:12.683
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Go get Gaby, please.

1685
01:34:26.863 --> 01:34:30.534
- I got a boner.
- Good.

1686
01:34:31.827 --> 01:34:34.454
- Do you have a condom?
- Yes.

1687
01:34:36.373 --> 01:34:38.375
And lube.

1688
01:34:38.542 --> 01:34:40.043
Seth?

1689
01:34:44.006 --> 01:34:46.466
Are...? Are you crying?

1690
01:34:46.842 --> 01:34:49.720
No, I just have something
in both my eyes.

1691
01:34:49.886 --> 01:34:51.096
I don't cry. That's funny.

1692
01:34:51.263 --> 01:34:53.557
You look... You look...
It looks like you're owing.

1693
01:34:53.724 --> 01:34:55.058
So...

1694
01:34:57.269 --> 01:34:59.646
It was my last chance
and I fucked it up, and...

1695
01:34:59.813 --> 01:35:01.398
Your last chance to do what?

1696
01:35:01.565 --> 01:35:04.651
To make you my girlfriend
for the summer.

1697
01:35:05.235 --> 01:35:08.071
You're, like, the coolest
person that's ever talked to me.

1698
01:35:08.238 --> 01:35:09.906
I thought we'd both be drunk.

1699
01:35:10.073 --> 01:35:12.826
What does me being drunk
have anything to do with it?

1700
01:35:12.993 --> 01:35:15.328
You'd never get with me
if you were sober.

1701
01:35:15.495 --> 01:35:16.997
Look at you.

1702
01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:22.252
- Look at me.
- Seth, come on, you didn't blow it.

1703
01:35:22.836 --> 01:35:24.296
I think maybe...

1704
01:35:25.088 --> 01:35:26.882
What the fuck?!

1705
01:35:27.049 --> 01:35:28.759
OW!
Help me.

1706
01:35:30.886 --> 01:35:31.928
Shirley.

1707
01:35:32.095 --> 01:35:34.181
I'm sorry.

1708
01:35:34.556 --> 01:35:35.891
Someone forgot
to call pest control.

1709
01:35:36.058 --> 01:35:37.100
Yep.

1710
01:35:37.267 --> 01:35:39.102
Where you going?
Hey, party's still on.

1711
01:35:39.269 --> 01:35:40.562
- Where are you going?
- Oh, no.

1712
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:43.940
If you're back there, get out.
Everyone, come on.

1713
01:35:44.107 --> 01:35:45.942
- We will shoot you.
- Party's over.

1714
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:47.611
- Evan.
- Get the hell out of here.

1715
01:35:47.778 --> 01:35:49.488
Keep your hands up.

1716
01:35:55.243 --> 01:35:57.954
Life's bullshit, Miroki.

1717
01:36:07.297 --> 01:36:09.299
Ev, wake the fuck up, man.

1718
01:36:09.466 --> 01:36:11.802
We gotta 90.
Those fucking cops are here, man.

1719
01:36:15.097 --> 01:36:17.349
"Oh, no, it's the cops."
We have a complaint.

1720
01:36:17.516 --> 01:36:18.600
Evan, come on.

1721
01:36:18.767 --> 01:36:20.143
Get the hell
out of here right now.

1722
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:21.978
Get out of here, pal.
She's not interested.

1723
01:36:22.145 --> 01:36:23.855
Drop the crantini
and move it, sister.

1724
01:36:24.022 --> 01:36:26.066
See you, sugar tits.
Guys, come on, move.

1725
01:36:26.233 --> 01:36:29.402
Everybody out.
Leave the booze and go.

1726
01:36:30.529 --> 01:36:31.780
What the fuck, man?

1727
01:36:32.531 --> 01:36:33.824
What the fuck, Seth?

1728
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:36.284
He's my best friend. Oh, shit.

1729
01:36:36.827 --> 01:36:39.287
Oh, shit. Come on.

1730
01:36:39.454 --> 01:36:42.124
I assume you all have guns
and crack.

1731
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:44.626
♪♪♪

1732
01:36:44.835 --> 01:36:48.588
Oh, my God, come on. Don't stop.

1733
01:36:51.133 --> 01:36:52.509
Okay, everyone,

1734
01:36:52.676 --> 01:36:55.554
prepare to be fucked
by the long dick of the law.

1735
01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.514
Get out.

1736
01:36:59.307 --> 01:37:00.350
Come on, go.

1737
01:37:04.521 --> 01:37:06.148
Fuck off, Seth.

1738
01:37:08.692 --> 01:37:09.901
Get a room.

1739
01:37:10.068 --> 01:37:12.529
I'm gonna save you.
I'm gonna save you, Evan.

1740
01:37:14.114 --> 01:37:15.824
Fuck.

1741
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:20.704
Fuck. Fuck, man, so heavy.

1742
01:37:35.969 --> 01:37:38.388
It's in. Oh, my God, it's in.

1743
01:37:38.555 --> 01:37:40.974
All right, everybody out.
Come on, let's go.

1744
01:37:41.141 --> 01:37:43.560
McLovin! What the fuck?

1745
01:37:43.727 --> 01:37:46.104
- Officer Slater, is that you?
- You ran away from us.

1746
01:37:46.271 --> 01:37:48.273
Why did you run away?
Michaels, get up here.

1747
01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.400
- No. I didn't run away.
- What the fuck?

1748
01:37:50.567 --> 01:37:51.610
Why would you do that?

1749
01:37:51.776 --> 01:37:54.321
- I was disoriented from...
- Were you violating that girl?

1750
01:37:54.487 --> 01:37:56.907
You just violated her with your penis?
Michaels, look.

1751
01:37:57.073 --> 01:37:58.491
- McLovin?
- No, no, no.

1752
01:37:59.034 --> 01:38:00.577
Whoa.
No.

1753
01:38:01.161 --> 01:38:02.996
Holy shit. Were you
just getting laid?

1754
01:38:03.163 --> 01:38:05.874
No. Yeah, I was, but...

1755
01:38:06.041 --> 01:38:08.335
- Yes, yes, he was.
- It's not what you think, guys.

1756
01:38:08.501 --> 01:38:10.754
- I'm not even...
- Sit the fuck down. Stay down.

1757
01:38:10.921 --> 01:38:12.756
- Calm down.
- I thought we were friends,

1758
01:38:12.923 --> 01:38:14.424
and then you go running away.

1759
01:38:14.591 --> 01:38:16.259
Contain yourself.

1760
01:38:16.426 --> 01:38:17.969
- We're friends.
- Shut up.

1761
01:38:18.136 --> 01:38:20.430
- Calm down. Calm down, man.
- Why? What?

1762
01:38:20.597 --> 01:38:22.265
You just cock-blocked
McLovin. Okay?

1763
01:38:22.432 --> 01:38:23.934
He's our friend.
We don't do that.

1764
01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:27.479
We should be guiding
his cock, not blocking it.

1765
01:38:27.646 --> 01:38:31.441
Just relax, okay?
Let's make this right.

1766
01:38:39.074 --> 01:38:41.368
Wait, what are you...?
What are you guys doing?

1767
01:38:41.534 --> 01:38:44.788
No, please, I can't... I can't go to jail.
Please, I can't go to jail.

1768
01:38:44.955 --> 01:38:48.792
No, look. We're really
sorry, McLovin.

1769
01:38:48.959 --> 01:38:52.295
This has... This has gone on...
This has gone way too far.

1770
01:38:52.462 --> 01:38:55.590
What? What are you talking about?

1771
01:38:55.757 --> 01:38:59.719
We know you're not 25, man.
We're not idiots, McLovin.

1772
01:38:59.886 --> 01:39:02.430
- Yeah.
- Did you know the whole time?

1773
01:39:02.597 --> 01:39:07.811
Look, when we were your
age, we hated cops.

1774
01:39:07.978 --> 01:39:11.147
When we saw you in the liquor
store today, we just...

1775
01:39:11.314 --> 01:39:13.441
I guess we saw a bit of
ourselves, you know,

1776
01:39:13.608 --> 01:39:16.736
and we just wanted
to show you that,

1777
01:39:16.903 --> 01:39:19.322
you know, cops can have
a fun time too, you know?

1778
01:39:19.489 --> 01:39:21.116
Yeah.

1779
01:39:21.825 --> 01:39:26.413
You know, in a way,
I think we wanted to show ourselves.

1780
01:39:28.123 --> 01:39:30.500
Also, I'm...

1781
01:39:30.667 --> 01:39:33.837
I'm really sorry that
I blocked your cock.

1782
01:39:34.462 --> 01:39:37.632
- Apology accepted.
- Seriously, man.

1783
01:39:38.633 --> 01:39:40.218
That feels good.

1784
01:39:40.385 --> 01:39:42.304
- It feels so good.
- I missed you guys.

1785
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:44.848
I just wish we could make
it up to you somehow, man.

1786
01:39:45.015 --> 01:39:47.684
Well, do you think you can
do me a really big favor?

1787
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.978
- What is it? Anything.
- Name it.

1788
01:39:50.145 --> 01:39:51.313
This kid's fucking crazy.

1789
01:39:51.479 --> 01:39:53.189
Stay back
for your own safety.

1790
01:39:53.356 --> 01:39:55.692
Get off me, you fucking cops.
Get your hands off me.

1791
01:39:55.859 --> 01:39:58.445
Do you know who I am?
I'm Fogell.

1792
01:39:59.279 --> 01:40:02.699
- The joint can't hold me.
- Holy shit, Fogell's a badass.

1793
01:40:02.866 --> 01:40:05.869
I'm gonna break your glasses,
you fucking cop. You can't hold me.

1794
01:40:06.036 --> 01:40:07.203
Fucking pigs.

1795
01:40:07.370 --> 01:40:09.205
Oh!

1796
01:40:12.125 --> 01:40:13.376
Oh, shit.

1797
01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:17.547
Nice mullet, asshole.

1798
01:40:18.173 --> 01:40:20.050
- You crazy.
- This kid's crazy.

1799
01:40:20.216 --> 01:40:23.345
He's nuts.
Well, we caught the infamous Fogell.

1800
01:40:23.511 --> 01:40:25.180
Get your hands...
Wait for me, Nicola.

1801
01:40:25.347 --> 01:40:26.806
Wait for me on the outside.

1802
01:40:27.724 --> 01:40:29.893
We were gonna go to Hawaii.

1803
01:40:30.935 --> 01:40:32.645
Man, that's gonna
get you so much ass.

1804
01:40:32.812 --> 01:40:33.855
Seriously?

1805
01:40:34.022 --> 01:40:37.233
- I know what to do about the car.
- Sweet.

1806
01:40:37.817 --> 01:40:41.488
Fucking go. Fucking throw up.

1807
01:40:45.325 --> 01:40:46.743
Are you carrying me?

1808
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:49.079
No, I'm saving you from the cops.

1809
01:40:49.371 --> 01:40:50.413
You saved me?

1810
01:40:52.248 --> 01:40:55.210
Well, I don't know what you're
talking about, but thanks.

1811
01:40:55.377 --> 01:40:57.545
Can I...?
Should I just walk?

1812
01:40:57.712 --> 01:41:01.257
- Should I walk?
- Yeah, sure.

1813
01:41:02.008 --> 01:41:06.054
- Okay.
- Where do you wanna go?

1814
01:41:06.846 --> 01:41:10.016
Sleepover at my house?
You wanna come sleep...?

1815
01:41:11.684 --> 01:41:14.687
- Okay.
- Okay.

1816
01:41:17.732 --> 01:41:19.442
Does your mom still
have pizza bagels?

1817
01:41:19.609 --> 01:41:21.277
Yeah. Lots.

1818
01:41:21.444 --> 01:41:23.446
Pizza bagels.

1819
01:41:31.621 --> 01:41:34.290
So by signing this,
you are officially saying

1820
01:41:34.457 --> 01:41:36.918
that as we stopped you
from being mugged,

1821
01:41:37.085 --> 01:41:40.004
a crackhead stole our cruiser
and did God knows what with it.

1822
01:41:40.171 --> 01:41:42.799
You cool to sign that?
Of course. I owe you guys my life.

1823
01:41:42.966 --> 01:41:45.635
We owe you, MC-Wait,
what's your real name again?

1824
01:41:45.802 --> 01:41:46.845
- Fogell.
- Fuck that.

1825
01:41:47.011 --> 01:41:49.639
- We're calling you McLovin.
- McLovin.

1826
01:41:49.806 --> 01:41:52.225
Let's do this dance, boys.

1827
01:42:15.582 --> 01:42:16.749
Oh, my God.

1828
01:42:16.916 --> 01:42:18.460
What did I tell
you guys, right?

1829
01:42:18.626 --> 01:42:19.669
That was crazy.

1830
01:42:25.633 --> 01:42:26.843
All right.

1831
01:42:27.010 --> 01:42:29.012
All right, now, guys,
check this out.

1832
01:42:29.179 --> 01:42:32.390
It's probably the greatest move
in doughnut-spinning history.

1833
01:42:32.557 --> 01:42:33.600
You paying attention?

1834
01:42:33.766 --> 01:42:37.061
Behold, the upward-spiraling pigtail.

1835
01:42:37.228 --> 01:42:40.523
- Why is it called that?
- I don't know!

1836
01:42:44.694 --> 01:42:46.821
Make the badge proud, Slater.

1837
01:42:48.781 --> 01:42:50.992
He's not usually this drunk
when he does this,

1838
01:42:51.159 --> 01:42:54.329
but I think
that could make it more cool.

1839
01:42:59.375 --> 01:43:01.169
McLovin!

1840
01:43:11.638 --> 01:43:12.722
Oh, no.

1841
01:43:13.515 --> 01:43:14.599
Fuck.

1842
01:43:21.231 --> 01:43:24.651
- Slater!
- Officer Slater.

1843
01:43:26.402 --> 01:43:29.405
All right. Fucking crazy.

1844
01:43:30.114 --> 01:43:31.157
Let's do this.

1845
01:43:31.991 --> 01:43:33.201
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Let's go. Go, go.

1846
01:43:33.368 --> 01:43:36.204
I'm going,
I'm going, I'm going.

1847
01:43:36.371 --> 01:43:38.581
- I'm out, I'm out.
- Good, here we go, here we go.

1848
01:43:38.748 --> 01:43:40.875
Yeah? Yeah, okay. Back up.

1849
01:43:41.042 --> 01:43:43.670
Don't blow yourself up, asshole.

1850
01:43:44.254 --> 01:43:46.297
Oh!

1851
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:52.345
Yes. Oh, my God.

1852
01:43:52.512 --> 01:43:54.931
It worked. It worked.

1853
01:43:55.098 --> 01:43:59.102
We won. We won.

1854
01:44:07.652 --> 01:44:09.612
Can we shoot at it?

1855
01:44:10.738 --> 01:44:13.908
I don't know. Can you?

1856
01:44:32.677 --> 01:44:34.429
Break yourself, fool.

1857
01:44:40.768 --> 01:44:42.312
Tight.

1858
01:44:42.478 --> 01:44:45.106
Listen, and then she said
she was gonna give me a blow-J.

1859
01:44:45.273 --> 01:44:47.567
I can't believe
she said that to you.

1860
01:44:47.734 --> 01:44:49.027
Man, you have no idea.

1861
01:44:49.193 --> 01:44:52.113
- What was she thinking?
- You don't even know.

1862
01:44:59.871 --> 01:45:03.916
I gotta tell you.
I gotta tell you something, Evan.

1863
01:45:04.083 --> 01:45:05.460
What?

1864
01:45:05.627 --> 01:45:07.503
I was in your room, like,
three weeks ago

1865
01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:09.964
while you were taking a shit.

1866
01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:15.178
And I saw your housing,
like, forms.

1867
01:45:15.637 --> 01:45:19.849
So I knew you and Fogell were
gonna live together, you know.

1868
01:45:20.016 --> 01:45:22.644
I'm sorry, man, I don't know.

1869
01:45:24.646 --> 01:45:28.775
I should've told you.
I don't know why I didn't.

1870
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:31.694
Don't... No, don't be sorry.
I should be sorry.

1871
01:45:31.861 --> 01:45:34.656
I was being a dick.
I was being a big dick to you.

1872
01:45:34.822 --> 01:45:36.074
No, I...

1873
01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:40.703
Listen, Seth, I want you to know,
I don't wanna live with Fogell.

1874
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:45.875
I never wanted to live with him.
I just don't... I ha...

1875
01:45:46.042 --> 01:45:48.211
I'm afraid to live with strangers.

1876
01:45:50.046 --> 01:45:51.214
I can't.

1877
01:45:52.298 --> 01:45:53.508
I can't do it.

1878
01:45:55.677 --> 01:45:58.429
I know, I know.

1879
01:45:59.722 --> 01:46:02.600
I can't believe you saved me.

1880
01:46:04.227 --> 01:46:06.396
You saved me.

1881
01:46:06.562 --> 01:46:09.524
I can't believe.
I owe you so...

1882
01:46:10.358 --> 01:46:14.529
You carried me. I love you.

1883
01:46:15.113 --> 01:46:16.572
I love you, man.

1884
01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:21.577
I love you.

1885
01:46:22.995 --> 01:46:27.667
I love you. I'm not even
embarrassed to say it. I just...

1886
01:46:27.834 --> 01:46:29.836
I Io... I love you.

1887
01:46:30.002 --> 01:46:31.713
- I'm not embarrassed.
- I love you.

1888
01:46:31.879 --> 01:46:33.381
I love you.

1889
01:46:33.548 --> 01:46:36.342
Why don't we say that every day?
Why can't we say it more often?

1890
01:46:36.509 --> 01:46:38.761
I just love you. I just wanna
go to the rooftops and scream:

1891
01:46:38.928 --> 01:46:40.263
"I love my best friend, Evan."

1892
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:44.100
- We should go up on my roof.
- For sure.

1893
01:46:44.267 --> 01:46:50.106
Like, when you went away for Easter,
on your vacation, I missed you.

1894
01:46:50.273 --> 01:46:53.776
- I missed you too.
- I want the world to know.

1895
01:46:54.193 --> 01:46:58.906
It's... It's the most beautiful
thing in the world.

1896
01:47:00.366 --> 01:47:02.326
Boop. Boop, boop.

1897
01:47:02.493 --> 01:47:06.038
Come here. Come here, man.

1898
01:47:16.674 --> 01:47:19.260
- I love you.
- I love you.

1899
01:47:32.231 --> 01:47:34.317
What the fuck?

1900
01:47:41.657 --> 01:47:46.704
- What up?
- Morning. Morning.

1901
01:47:47.163 --> 01:47:49.665
I should get moving.
I should get moving.

1902
01:47:49.832 --> 01:47:52.084
I should be getting
a move on, for sure.

1903
01:47:52.251 --> 01:47:55.254
Yeah, you don't... I mean,
you don't have to, you know.

1904
01:47:55.421 --> 01:47:58.508
I don't really have
anything going on.

1905
01:47:58.674 --> 01:48:01.260
You don't have to
rush off like that.

1906
01:48:04.722 --> 01:48:06.808
You wanna hang out?

1907
01:48:07.183 --> 01:48:09.685
I was gonna go to the mall.

1908
01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:13.314
I have to get a new comforter.

1909
01:48:13.898 --> 01:48:16.442
For college. The mall,
they would sell that.

1910
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:18.194
Cool. So, uh,

1911
01:48:19.529 --> 01:48:21.864
your mom's got huge tits.

1912
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:25.743
What do you think?

1913
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:27.328
I don't know, man.
Don't ask me.

1914
01:48:27.495 --> 01:48:30.289
Because I don't give a shit
how pants look.

1915
01:48:30.456 --> 01:48:32.875
Yeah, I need someone's opinion.

1916
01:48:33.042 --> 01:48:36.379
Those are too tight.
Those are way too tight.

1917
01:48:36.546 --> 01:48:39.048
- Yeah, but, like...
- Way too tight. You need to upgrade.

1918
01:48:39.257 --> 01:48:41.884
There's not enough pants where
there should be more pant in there.

1919
01:48:42.051 --> 01:48:44.428
Yeah, but... I mean,
does it look weird?

1920
01:48:44.595 --> 01:48:48.015
Looks like you're standing funny. You
wouldn't be standing like that. Like a duck.

1921
01:48:48.182 --> 01:48:49.976
Yeah, but I'm doing like...

1922
01:48:50.142 --> 01:48:53.437
- I'm doing a college poses, it's like...
- I don't know if you are.

1923
01:48:53.604 --> 01:48:55.523
- You might just be doing...
- Hey, prof.

1924
01:48:55.690 --> 01:48:57.775
- Okay.
- That test was... Whoo!

1925
01:48:58.401 --> 01:49:02.280
Hey, Susan. Are you gonna
party tonight or no?

1926
01:49:02.446 --> 01:49:06.075
Yeah, but that's just... It's like I
wish there were more pants where...

1927
01:49:06.284 --> 01:49:07.535
You know, where there aren't.

1928
01:49:07.702 --> 01:49:09.579
But when I was wearing
your dad's pants last night,

1929
01:49:09.745 --> 01:49:12.582
I realized that if I wear pants
that are a little too small,

1930
01:49:12.748 --> 01:49:14.500
it might encourage me
to lose a little weight.

1931
01:49:14.667 --> 01:49:16.586
And also, chicks can
kind of see, like,

1932
01:49:16.752 --> 01:49:19.422
you know, the borders and
outline of my dick a little.

1933
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:22.592
Yeah, man, they go nuts for that.
The male camel toe.

1934
01:49:22.758 --> 01:49:25.803
Yeah, the camel tail.
It's right...

1935
01:49:25.970 --> 01:49:27.680
I know where it is,
where it happens.

1936
01:49:27.847 --> 01:49:29.515
Like, right there.

1937
01:49:29.682 --> 01:49:33.311
It's like they're so tight that one
ball is, like, above my dick, even.

1938
01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:35.187
- Yeah, exactly.
- It's like three.

1939
01:49:35.354 --> 01:49:38.024
It's like a three thing.
It's like ball, dick, ball.

1940
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:39.567
It's like a division sign.

1941
01:49:39.734 --> 01:49:41.569
Like a bunch of people
crammed into a van.

1942
01:49:42.528 --> 01:49:44.147
Like, does my ass look weird?

1943
01:49:44.172 --> 01:49:46.348
It makes a lot of stuff look weird.

1944
01:49:46.616 --> 01:49:48.075
No, those are way too tight.

1945
01:49:48.826 --> 01:49:51.662
You're right, these look stupid.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1946
01:49:51.829 --> 01:49:55.124
I'm really sorry about that.
I can't believe I actually did that.

1947
01:49:55.291 --> 01:49:57.376
I feel bad that I'm making you
buy me a new one.

1948
01:49:57.543 --> 01:49:58.836
It's seems, like, ridiculous.

1949
01:49:59.003 --> 01:50:03.090
- No. I have to, it's puke. It's gross.
- Oh, my God.

1950
01:50:03.257 --> 01:50:05.801
Do alcoholics get hangovers?

1951
01:50:05.968 --> 01:50:08.804
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit. It's them.

1952
01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:13.601
- What the fuck do we do, man?
- Don't stop. I don't know.

1953
01:50:15.394 --> 01:50:17.855
- Hey.
- Hey.

1954
01:50:18.773 --> 01:50:20.524
How's it going?

1955
01:50:22.193 --> 01:50:25.029
It's so good to...
How are you feeling?

1956
01:50:25.613 --> 01:50:29.158
I've felt better. But I'll be fine.
How about you?

1957
01:50:30.201 --> 01:50:34.372
I'm okay, you know, yeah.
Did you have fun last night?

1958
01:50:35.039 --> 01:50:36.457
Uh...

1959
01:50:36.874 --> 01:50:40.461
You know, I actually
don't remember much.

1960
01:50:40.628 --> 01:50:42.213
I don't remember anything.

1961
01:50:43.047 --> 01:50:45.549
- So weird.
- Nothing.

1962
01:50:45.716 --> 01:50:49.178
Um, I didn't puke on you, did I?

1963
01:50:49.595 --> 01:50:51.889
You didn't. I remember
that you... I avoided it.

1964
01:50:52.056 --> 01:50:56.185
It whizzed right by me, and I said,
"Stay away from me," you know.

1965
01:50:56.769 --> 01:51:02.733
I'm really sorry about everything
last night, and I just...

1966
01:51:04.402 --> 01:51:06.862
Thank you for being
such a nice guy about it all.

1967
01:51:07.738 --> 01:51:09.407
That's okay, you know.

1968
01:51:09.573 --> 01:51:12.201
At least you don't have
a black eye from it.

1969
01:51:15.579 --> 01:51:18.749
- That looks terrible.
- Yeah.

1970
01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:23.921
You look great. You don't look terrible.
It's just, like, a bad bruise.

1971
01:51:24.088 --> 01:51:26.882
Everything's great, just from he...
This, just like right there.

1972
01:51:27.049 --> 01:51:28.676
- Your eye.
- Yeah, your eye.

1973
01:51:28.843 --> 01:51:30.511
Everything else is great.

1974
01:51:30.678 --> 01:51:34.724
But seriously, I acted like
a fucking idiot last night.

1975
01:51:37.393 --> 01:51:41.605
You don't deserve that.
So I'm sorry.

1976
01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.277
On the upside,
I think you look cool with a black eye.

1977
01:51:46.444 --> 01:51:49.822
I'm just gonna throw that out there.
I don't... I don't know.

1978
01:51:49.989 --> 01:51:54.035
Well, thank you, smart guy. Thanks.
That's actually, uh, why I'm here.

1979
01:51:54.201 --> 01:51:57.538
Because I have to get a ton of
cover-up for the grad photo.

1980
01:51:57.705 --> 01:52:00.166
Oh, man. Fuck.

1981
01:52:00.332 --> 01:52:02.793
And I'm gonna get Jules
a new comforter.

1982
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.920
I have to get a comforter too.
For college.

1983
01:52:05.087 --> 01:52:07.631
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I just figured I would need one.

1984
01:52:07.798 --> 01:52:09.759
So, Seth...

1985
01:52:11.052 --> 01:52:15.056
So do you wanna come buy
me cover-up or something?

1986
01:52:15.222 --> 01:52:17.308
I mean, you kind of owe me.

1987
01:52:18.642 --> 01:52:20.978
Yeah, definitely.
I would love to do that.

1988
01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.440
I had such bad acne last year

1989
01:52:24.607 --> 01:52:27.985
that I pretty much became,
like, an expert on the stuff.

1990
01:52:28.527 --> 01:52:31.155
Well, you drove.
Evan drove me here, though, so...

1991
01:52:31.322 --> 01:52:33.407
Well, 30... Well, I mean,
I have my dad's car.

1992
01:52:33.574 --> 01:52:36.452
So I could just give you a lift,

1993
01:52:36.619 --> 01:52:38.662
and then Evan
could take Becca home.

1994
01:52:38.829 --> 01:52:41.290
If that works.
I don't know if it's in your route.

1995
01:52:41.457 --> 01:52:42.708
It'd be fine with me.

1996
01:52:42.875 --> 01:52:45.669
Fine, yeah.
Maybe we can get some food.

1997
01:52:46.837 --> 01:52:48.172
Yeah, I'd like that.

1998
01:52:51.008 --> 01:52:52.718
So I guess I'll call you, then.

1999
01:52:52.885 --> 01:52:54.929
Yeah, give me a call.
Yeah, you have my number.

2000
01:52:55.096 --> 01:52:58.182
I have your information.
So put her there.

2001
01:52:58.349 --> 01:53:01.352
Perfect. Good.
All right, man.

2002
01:53:01.519 --> 01:53:02.937
- Okay.
- Okay, guys.

2003
01:53:03.104 --> 01:53:04.688
- Becca.
- Bye, guys.

2004
01:53:04.855 --> 01:53:06.440
- Bye, have fun.
- See you, Jules.

2005
01:53:06.607 --> 01:53:09.777
Yeah, that's funny.
Too funny.

2006
01:53:09.944 --> 01:53:11.362
Where do you
wanna go to eat?

2007
01:53:11.529 --> 01:53:12.530
<i>I'm gonna fuck her.</i>

2008
01:53:13.823 --> 01:53:17.118
So can you honestly help me
figure out what kind of cover-up to get?
