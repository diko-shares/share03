1
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.480
<i>Where you are in Bangkok. Goodbye, sir.</i>

2
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.560
Paris, my love.

3
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.520
I'm afraid I fail to see
what assistance we can provide.

4
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.640
Mr. Bellanger, I'm not sure you understand
the urgency of the situation.

5
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.840
Look! "European Girl."
She is Stéphanie Parry, a French citizen.

6
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.080
- This is her passport.
- She is one of us.

7
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.640
We found it in her killer's apartment
when he fled to France.

8
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.160
We even have the address
of his mother in France.

9
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.560
- We think they're heading there.
- She lives in Paris.

10
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880
All you have to do is get
the French police to pick them up there.

11
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.840
Your accusation that this Gautier
murdered Miss Parry rests on what?

12
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.360
A passport found in his room?

13
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.680
Do you know how many tourists
come to this building each day

14
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.960
to report a passport mislaid or lost?

15
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.440
I told you,
Dominique saw her leave with Mr. Gautier.

16
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.160
And where is he, this Mr. Dominique?

17
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.840
- In France, because he was lucky enough...
- In France.

18
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.160
Because with your assistance,

19
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.000
he took the visa from Miss Parry's
passport to flee the country.

20
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.840
Making him a criminal,
and you his accomplice.

21
00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.055
But we are French citizens,
for fuck's sake!

22
00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.200
You're supposed to help us!

23
00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:26.920
Calm down.
Do you see that office behind me?

24
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.600
It is filled with files
of French refugees from Vietnam.

25
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.280
Each of them
we are helping flee a real war,

26
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.600
against real communism,
across a real border.

27
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.560
So excuse me.

28
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.160
Your story, your accusations,
your hysteria...

29
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.800
about this famous Mr. Gautier...

30
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.680
I don't believe it.

31
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.880
She's a little shy, I'm sorry.

32
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.640
Don't apologize, Stephane.
I'm very glad to meet her.

33
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.640
And besides, we have a few days now
to get to know each other.

34
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.720
Don't we, Cleo?

35
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.640
I'm sorry it's been so long
since I've seen you, Mum.

36
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.760
Forgive me.

37
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.520
You're here now. That's all that matters.

38
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.040
And we're going to stay.

39
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.120
What are you doing there, Stephane?

40
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.000
No one goes to Thailand for four days.

41
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.880
Mum, I haven't heard from him.
I'm worried.

42
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.760
<i>Paris, Mother. I'm in Paris.</i>

43
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.560
<i>Marie-Andrée?
Listen, is everything all right?</i>

44
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.440
<i>The police came looking for you.
Why are the police trying to find you?</i>

45
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.920
I have no idea, but it's all right.

46
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.760
Because we are going to stay here,
begin a new life in Paris together.

47
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.400
<i>We're here for a very important
business meeting.</i>

48
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.160
<i>And Charles tells me that once it's done...</i>

49
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.360
<i>we will have everything
we've ever dreamed of.</i>

50
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.560
<i>He's taking me to meet his mother.</i>

51
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.560
<i>Mother, I've never been so happy.</i>

52
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.760
I am sorry, Marie.
I shouldn't have taken you there.

53
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.600
I don't understand it.
Every time I'm with her, I lose it.

54
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.680
Charles,
why did your mother say those things?

55
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.120
- What did she mean by them?
- Don't worry about her.

56
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.880
Anyway, it's the last time we'll see her.

57
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.480
But, Charles, she is your mother,
your family.

58
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.840
You want to know
what her idea of a "normal" family is?

59
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.839
How unhappy I was as a child?

60
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.016
There was a civil war in my country,
bombs going off in the streets every day.

61
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.720
But that didn't stop me from running away.

62
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.720
And when they brought me home,
my only thought...

63
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.680
was to run away again.

64
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.480
So I never want to hear about it again.

65
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.880
Just remember why we are here.

66
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.040
The deal...

67
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.079
No, not just the deal.
The life we will build here together.

68
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.400
A family?

69
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.600
A real family.

70
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.960
Goddamnit!

71
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.000
Madhu, don't run too far!

72
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.320
Madhu, come here.

73
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.840
Dad, come, let's go.

74
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.840
- Swear it!
- ...now.

75
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.640
Swear you didn't make an orphan
of that woman's child?

76
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.600
I swear it.

77
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.160
Swear it on your child.

78
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.320
Swear it on Madhu.

79
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.280
I swear it on the head of my daughter.

80
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.040
Forget all that now.

81
00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.400
Concentrate on the deal.

82
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.080
Hello. Is that <i>The Bangkok Post?</i>

83
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.520
May I speak to the editor's office?
Mr. Stanton, please.

84
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.800
I'm calling from Interpol.

85
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.840
Don't think that you'll achieve anything
by doing this, Knippenberg.

86
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.840
Shaming the world into action?
It'll get you nowhere.

87
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:20.560
This will haunt you
for the rest of your career.

88
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.120
The two of you are very much in love,
aren't you?

89
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.400
But what is love?

90
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.920
It's just a fantasy for children.

91
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.320
For fools like you.

92
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:22.480
May I come in?

93
00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.720
No, my father will be back soon.

94
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.200
No, he won't. I saw him leave with Madhu.

95
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.560
Our child.

96
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.920
What are you doing here, Charles?

97
00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.840
I live in Paris.

98
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.320
I am a businessman now.

99
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.240
I'm even opening a bank account
under my own name.

100
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:43.960
You don't understand.

101
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.040
You shouldn't be here.

102
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.080
She looks like me.

103
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.240
I know.

104
00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.040
I chose her because of it.

105
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.920
I'm married, Charles.

106
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:55.000
I'm happy. So is Madhu.

107
00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.440
Please just go.

108
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.600
I am here
because I never stopped loving you.

109
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.560
She is nothing.

110
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.240
She couldn't compare to you.

111
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.720
You, me and Madhu...

112
00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.720
together.

113
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.680
That is what I see
when I think about the future.

114
00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.440
There is no future.
Not for us. Not for you.

115
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.880
That poor girl.

116
00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.680
She could have been me.

117
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:50.880
You need to go now.

118
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.480
Tell me you don't still love me.

119
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.200
Tell me you don't still love me.

120
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.040
Tell me.

121
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.480
Leave Paris...

122
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.320
while you still can.

123
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.040
Hello, madam. Interpol.

124
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.960
We have been given this address
for a certain Marie-Andrée Leclerc.

125
00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.600
Do you know this woman?

126
00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:56.720
It's all over the city.
My photo is all over the city.

127
00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.200
Juliette. You told me she was dead.

128
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.000
Do you really believe I would have
a baby with you? Look at yourself.

129
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.560
What have you made me?

130
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.920
- It says that I am a murderer!
- You knew very well from the beginning.

131
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.080
You not only knew it,
you were thrilled by it.

132
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.640
But it was you!
It was you who killed them all!

133
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.760
It was Ajay who orphaned that child
you pretend to care about.

134
00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.720
It was him, also,
who strangled her mother,

135
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.120
before breaking her neck
when I asked him to.

136
00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.960
The Turk? It was me who killed him.

137
00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.880
And the American girl,
the couple in Nepal.

138
00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.200
Would you like me to go on?

139
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.000
Pack your bags.

140
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.360
I'm not going anywhere with you.

141
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.440
Go for it.

142
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.960
Your suitcase!

143
00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.240
Listen...

144
00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.160
I understand you're disappointed.

145
00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.520
And I understand you're afraid.

146
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:42.200
But believe me,
you and me will never end up in jail.

147
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.040
You hear me?

148
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.360
Nobody cages us.

149
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.440
Nobody.

150
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.520
No one hates it here as much as I do.

151
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.840
But we need to start
playing the game again

152
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.520
and there's nowhere better to play it.

153
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:26.080
A few weeks,
then we'll go wherever you want.

154
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.920
Come here before you drown.
