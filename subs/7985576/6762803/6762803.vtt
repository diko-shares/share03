00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.680
Who is Angela?

3
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.400
Oh, no one. I don't really like her.

4
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.000
She is trying to learn mahjong
and wants me to join,

5
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.400
but I don't feel like going.

6
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.800
Her loss.

7
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.200
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

8
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.480
I think I'm through with Asia now.

9
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.840
Alain is moving the business to Europe.

10
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.280
We're going to be moving there.

11
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.680
But you only just got back.

12
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.040
When are you leaving?

13
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.360
Oh, not for a few months.

14
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440
But that's where I want to be now.

15
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.040
- He's taking me to meet his mother.
- Where? Europe? France?

16
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.080
Nadine, your turn.

17
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.080
No, I don't feel like it.

18
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.160
Leave her alone.

19
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
When will you be back?

20
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.400
I don't know. With the traffic...

21
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.320
Maybe I should...

22
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.600
Captain, as many men as you can gather.
But it must happen now.

23
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.880
Understood, sir.

24
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.840
Green Unit!

25
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.000
New orders. We go, now!

26
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.800
Shit.

27
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.600
Crap!

28
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.720
Come and try.

29
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.480
I don't feel like it.

30
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.720
I think maybe I should go.

31
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280
Try.

32
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.880
Harder.

33
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:04.200
Shit, I think I've sprained my wrist.
I'll go up for some ice.

34
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.280
Let me see.

35
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.480
I find it hard to understand
Dominique didn't say a thing to you.

36
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.600
You were so close.

37
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.600
I've heard nothing from him.

38
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.240
He had no passport, no money.

39
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.280
We were his only friends in Bangkok.

40
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.920
It's so hard to understand how he left,
never mind why.

41
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.680
I miss him too. I don't know what to say.

42
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.400
- I miss him too.
- You're really hurting me.

43
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.280
Better?

44
00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:50.800
Let me show you why it hurt.

45
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.200
First make a fist. Squeeze hard like this.

46
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880
And when you strike, use your hip.

47
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.960
I know you helped Dominique.

48
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.840
But who is going to help you?

49
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.280
Let me go home.

50
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.360
What are you doing here?

51
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.080
They're not here! They're not here.

52
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.480
Is that him?

53
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.920
- Yes, but follow me.
- Nadine?

54
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.880
This is Paul. He works with Remi.

55
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.880
The police are on their way.
Herman is telling them to come now.

56
00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.040
No! I told you, they're not here!

57
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.520
Who? The other two? So what?
The cops can take Gautier and...

58
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.520
No! They must arrest all three!

59
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.560
Or Remi and I, we're dead.

60
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.360
Then you need to go back down.

61
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.840
And keep him where we can see him.

62
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.840
Feeling better, Nadine?

63
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.920
Oh, you don't punch that hard.

64
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.320
Now I want to swim.

65
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.560
<i>Stop what you are doing.</i>

66
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.000
<i>You must wait until all three suspects
are in the apartment.</i>

67
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.640
Understood.

68
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.440
Everything okay?

69
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
All good.

70
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.040
<i>Wait for order, do you copy?</i>

71
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.000
- Captain. There's no key for the safe.
- Let's take the whole thing.

72
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.599
Take them away.

73
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.880
Hello, Nadine.

74
00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.400
Everything okay?

75
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.880
I'm sorry.

76
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.400
How are you doing, my darling? I'm sorry.

77
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.040
Your commission.
For all the buyers you brought to me.

78
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.360
Thank you so much.

79
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.200
Thanks again, Alain.

80
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.480
You're sure it's safe to stay?

81
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.520
I understand your fears, my darling,

82
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.840
but you must simply trust me
and all will be well.

83
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.200
Excuse me.

84
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.920
- Hello.
- <i>Suda, it's me.</i>

85
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

86
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.600
The guy who called you
is your sexy <i>farang</i> boyfriend, Suda?

87
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.320
Darling, I'm so sorry!

88
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.080
No more playing Mata Hari.

89
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.920
I promise.

90
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.040
Yes, Kannika?

91
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.840
A call from the police station
asking for Mr. Knippenberg.

92
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.080
My heart, do not be afraid.

93
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.920
I am afraid.

94
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.400
I am afraid. I am not a criminal.

95
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.040
No, listen to me. You're not a criminal.

96
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.760
Okay? You're not a criminal.

97
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.880
Remember who you really are.

98
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.640
Remember who we are.

99
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.400
We have come so far
that nothing can stop us.

100
00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.480
Nothing.

101
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.560
Is Suda's father going to help us?

102
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.160
I have made new friends here.

103
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.480
- Listen to me.
- I'm afraid.

104
00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.400
You tell them nothing. Trust me.

105
00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:22.920
I have it all under control.

106
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.120
It's not true.
It has to be some stupid mistake.

107
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.639
They wouldn't arrest him without reason.

108
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.600
Drugs, Papa? Alain doesn't touch drugs!

109
00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.400
He barely even drinks!

110
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.840
Can't you help?

111
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.120
Me, help? Are you mad?

112
00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.040
I am a traffic sergeant!

113
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.240
And even if I was the Major General,
I would never...

114
00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.000
But it's not true, Papa!

115
00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.000
- Hello?
- <i>Cherie.</i>

116
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.480
Why did you let this happen?

117
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.200
Get me the paperwork now.

118
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.880
Remi, come and see.

119
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.600
Someone in their apartment.

120
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.360
It's probably just the concierge.

121
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.360
Looking for anything worth taking.

122
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.400
It's nothing, I'm telling you.

123
00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.320
I'm going to take a shower.

124
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.200
What's wrong with you? Open the safe now.

125
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.560
What if the evidence is in there?

126
00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.480
Go and open it now.

127
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.320
Go and get a technician!

128
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.400
Papa, the police at the Central Division
released Alain.

129
00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:56.920
They've apologized.
Please be nice to him, Dad, for me.

130
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.640
Dad.

131
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:27.000
Goddamn it!
