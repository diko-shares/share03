00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.760
Here's your bag.

3
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920
He's going to Australia
to work on a yacht.

4
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.080
Come on, that’s enough.

5
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.880
He's not going to war.

6
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.800
<i>Dear Mum and Dad...</i>

7
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.640
<i>The yachts and Australia were amazing...</i>

8
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.680
<i>But I spent every day with
the sort of people I've known all my life.</i>

9
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.360
<i>I will be home soon, but first
I want to have some new experiences.</i>

10
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.320
French?

11
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.520
Yes.

12
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.840
Alain.

13
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.600
Hello. Dominique.

14
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.880
What am I supposed to say? He's crazy!

15
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.640
...wasn't it all a little bourgeois?

16
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.440
White boys in white T-shirts
on white yachts...?

17
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.000
Yes. That's why I haven't gone home yet.

18
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.520
You’re looking for something different?

19
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.760
Yes.

20
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.120
You trust me?

21
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.000
I've always known boys like you,
Dominique.

22
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.760
My mother sent me
to a French boarding school.

23
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.000
A half-caste boy from Saigon.
You can imagine how I was bullied.

24
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.880
When my mother returned for me,
I had forgotten all my Vietnamese.

25
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.320
I could speak only French.

26
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.720
I had forgotten everything.

27
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.760
Mind the step.

28
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.159
If he's been so ill,
shouldn't he go to a hospital?

29
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.600
No, absolutely not.

30
00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:48.000
The hospitals here are a death sentence.

31
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.320
Yes...

32
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.720
And we're caring for you here.
Right, Dominique?

33
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.600
Sit down.

34
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.400
That's Coco.

35
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.440
Before you eat, however. Medicine.

36
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.480
What is the correct amount, Monique?

37
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.120
One glass, twice a day.

38
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.240
Here you go.

39
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.040
Well... Cheers!

40
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.520
I don’t know what to say, Alain!

41
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.880
If you can just help Monique
around the place.

42
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.680
Of course, anything. You tell me.

43
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.760
- Get better.
- Thank you.

44
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.440
Fuck.

45
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.360
Remi...

46
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.640
Do you remember?

47
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.360
Fuck.

48
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.240
You're an asshole.

49
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.080
Me, an asshole?

50
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.640
- Yeah, an asshole.
- Really?

51
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.640
If you'd listened to me from the start,

52
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.920
we wouldn't have been living
through hell all this time!

53
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.920
And what was I supposed to do?

54
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.200
Wait for you at home?

55
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.640
They were neighbors.

56
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.480
How could I have known?
They were neighbors!

57
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.720
Get me to a doctor. I'm dying.

58
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.760
Calm, Dominique. You don't need a doctor.

59
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.880
I’ve got to call my parents.

60
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.480
Don’t call them, they will only worry.

61
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.200
It's an ordeal, I know.

62
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.080
But see it as a purge.

63
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.200
Once recovered you will feel...

64
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.520
Like a new boy.

65
00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.840
No...

66
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.480
Like a man.

67
00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.360
A man who doesn’t need his mama.

68
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.960
Ah, Dominique, I have a present for you.

69
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
That is not for you, Coco!

70
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:30.480
Listen, Alain, I just want to see
how I feel without it, you know?

71
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.440
Of course he must stop taking
the medicine, if that's what he wants.

72
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.880
You mustn't force him.

73
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.480
Also, Alain... I was wondering,
can I have my passport back?

74
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.600
Of course.

75
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.960
Now don't worry, Dominique,
I have been a little naughty with you.

76
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.920
It's just something I do for the business.
For us.

77
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.360
Don't worry.

78
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.720
Asian.

79
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.560
Alain... Maybe I should talk
to the police myself...

80
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.560
No, Dominique. That's a very bad idea.

81
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.800
But why?

82
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.240
No. Wait in the car.

83
00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.840
I can give you a lift home.

84
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.640
See, I've brought the car.

85
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.000
And dinner tomorrow?

86
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.920
I'm taking Colonel Romyen
and Suda home.

87
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.280
Take a tuk-tuk back.

88
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.760
I know the authorities here
and how to deal with them.

89
00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.520
I told Colonel Romyen
you're here illegally

90
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.320
but that I vouch for you.

91
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.080
Let me handle everything. Okay?

92
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.720
And...

93
00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.960
About Monique and Suda.

94
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.720
Dominique, why do you look so unhappy?

95
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.120
I'm fine.

96
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.960
- What an asshole.
- Yes, for sure.

97
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.280
How you doing?

98
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.480
Going to work already?

99
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.680
Alas...

100
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.680
- You're good?
- Yeah.

101
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.280
Monique?

102
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.000
Where are they taking him?

103
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.080
The hospital.

104
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.400
He is very sick.

105
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.680
Who is she?

106
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.400
The lover of the Turk.

107
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.640
The guy who got sick at the party?

108
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.840
Who went to hospital?

109
00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.720
Yes.

110
00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.320
What's wrong with her?

111
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.200
They are both junkies, you know?

112
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.680
Junkies and heroin smugglers.

113
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.440
They are not worth your concern.

114
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.240
Why does everyone
who comes here get sick?

115
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.480
<i>Hello?</i>

116
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.560
<i>Hello?</i>

117
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.720
Hi, Dad.

118
00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.080
- <i>Dominique, is that you?</i>
- Yes, it's me.

119
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.360
How are you? How is Mum?

120
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.680
<i>She is fine but she misses you.</i>

121
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.480
I miss both of you too.

122
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.560
<i>Where are you?</i>

123
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.600
I'm in Bangkok.

124
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.960
- <i>Bangkok, still?</i>
- Yes.

125
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.280
<i>Dominique, when are you coming home?</i>

126
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.920
I...

127
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.400
I... I've been a little bit sick...

128
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.800
<i>You’ve been sick?</i>

129
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.440
<i>Give me the phone!</i>

130
00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.440
<i>Dominique?
Dominique, my God, are you okay?</i>

131
00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.760
- No, really, I'm better.
- <i>Dominique, you have to come home!</i>

132
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.320
I...

133
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.200
I can't come back, Dad.

134
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.760
I can't come back, it’s so expensive.

135
00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.960
I love you so much
and I think of you all the time and...

136
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.240
<i>Dominique! My God, you must come home!</i>

137
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.520
Take a seat, I'm coming.

138
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.280
- Are you leaving already?
- Just a little trip to Hong Kong.

139
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:16.200
- You okay, Monique?
- Yeah, bye.

140
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.320
A little present to say thanks.
Merry Christmas.

141
00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.760
Thank you so much.

142
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.320
Thank you, Alain.

143
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.800
Dominique, come for supper?

144
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.480
Dominique, it's me!

145
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.200
Dominique, please open.

146
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.160
Remi is going to kick down the door!

147
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.560
Nadine, I'm not...

148
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Open!

149
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.880
How can I trust you, Nadine?

150
00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.440
You help him sell his jewels.

151
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.160
You take his gifts and his money.

152
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.200
I don't know what you're talking about.

153
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.800
I got you food.

154
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.960
Dominique, please open the door.

155
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.280
She...

156
00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.000
She came to the apartment a week ago.

157
00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.760
You remember the Turkish guy
who got ill at the party?

158
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.320
She came looking for him.
I saw Alain and Ajay take her away.

159
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.760
The other one is the Dutch couple.

160
00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.880
Dutch? It says Australian.

161
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.640
It's the Dutch couple
who were staying here!

162
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.000
- How can you be sure?
- I saw them, Nadine.

163
00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.800
They were here lying on the bed.

164
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.240
Right by the clock
that belonged to that American girl.

165
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:10.360
Alain made them sick,
just like the Turk, just like me.

166
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.040
Why have they kept me around for so long?

167
00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.880
What are they going to do with me?

168
00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.360
Dominique, listen, we go to the police.

169
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.680
No, we can't!

170
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.360
He is friends with the police.

171
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.920
He could be back from Hong Kong
any moment!

172
00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.160
I don't want to die here.

173
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.160
Of course you won't die,
you're going to leave...

174
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.480
How?

175
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.400
I have no money, no passport!
My visa's expired!

176
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.240
I'm screwed, he's trapped me here!

177
00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.120
No, we can help. We have money.

178
00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.880
How? No visa, no passport?

179
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.720
We will find a solution.

180
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.080
Calm down.

181
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.720
It's me, Remi.

182
00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.360
I’ll pay you back, I swear.

183
00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.520
This is mine.

184
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.280
Damn.

185
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200
It's okay.

186
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.280
Just remove the picture
and replace it with yours.

187
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.160
Get a knife, look for some glue.

188
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.040
- It'll work.
- Okay.

189
00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.600
What is that?

190
00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.000
You said a knife.

191
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.520
What about the visa?

192
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.160
You can't get through without it.

193
00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.600
What about these French passports?
Maybe in one of them?

194
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.400
Found one.

195
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.760
- Is it valid?
- Yes.

196
00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:50.840
You're going home.

197
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.640
- You're going home!
- It's her.

198
00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.720
Who?

199
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.080
The dead girl in the newspaper.

200
00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.520
What if he's at the airport?
Maybe he's been watching us!

201
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.920
Don’t worry, it’ll be okay.

202
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.720
Thank you.

203
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:30.760
We are looking for an exit stamp.

204
00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:36.080
Around 25th December last year.

205
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.040
Here. He definitely left the country.

206
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.520
The same question...

207
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.520
...exit stamps for Bloem and Dekker,
December 1975.

208
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.840
Get them something to eat.

209
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.440
They also left the country.

210
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.320
<i>My dear Nadine and Remi.</i>

211
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:59.000
<i>It's hard to explain
why I haven’t written until now.</i>

212
00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:04.160
<i>It is one thing to be safe,
but another to feel it.</i>

213
00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.280
<i>Every morning I wake terrified
I am still there in Kanit House.</i>

214
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.480
<i>I've just wanted to forget it all.</i>

215
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.160
<i>But you must know...</i>

216
00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:21.960
<i>Not a day goes by when I don’t thank God
for the two of you and all you did for me.</i>

217
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.120
<i>Your friend, Dominique.</i>

218
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.560
Hello, Nadine.

219
00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.640
How are you?

220
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.160
Alain! Where have you been?

221
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:46.360
Monique!

222
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.880
I missed you.

223
00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.160
You look great!
