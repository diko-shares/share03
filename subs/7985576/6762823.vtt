00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.960
How many more of these fools
do we have to befriend?

2
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.960
Look, I also hate this place.

3
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.480
But remember, we no longer have Ajay

4
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.480
to find us new passports
and travelers' cheques.

5
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.480
So if you want us to leave India,
we need them.

6
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.280
<i>I thought you were in Paris,
Marie, having babies.</i>

7
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.080
- Please, Mama.
- <i>And now you're in Delhi?</i>

8
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.120
<i>And you are all over the newspapers.</i>

9
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320
It's not true.

10
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.280
I am innocent.

11
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.640
It was him. All of it.

12
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.040
I have to come home.

13
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.840
<i>Now she wants to come home!</i>

14
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.480
I have no passport, no money

15
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.280
You have to help me.

16
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.520
<i>But how? Tell me, how? Marie-Andr√©e?</i>

17
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.800
There was a time
I longed to have your child inside me.

18
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.920
But if it were born now

19
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.760
I would smash its brains out
in front of you.

20
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.080
Mr. Knippenberg?

21
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.600
He's not here, but he left these for you
with his respects.

22
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.360
- Thank you.
- Sir.

23
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.280
Thank you.

24
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.440
It'll be okay. Life goes on.

25
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.880
Are you still not feeling better?

26
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.200
I'm beginning to feel worried.

27
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.760
Should we go upstairs?
Come, I'll take you upstairs.

28
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.440
Can you bring me some water?
A glass of water?

29
00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160
Get some water, please.

30
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.800
Get a doctor. Please, we need a doctor.

31
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.040
Come on, don't let them get away.

32
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.840
- Somebody do something!
- What did he give us?

33
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.280
It was medicine.

34
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.840
Call the police.

35
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.440
- It was medicine, stay calm.
- Call the police.

36
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.600
Call the police!

37
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.120
He's got my bag!

38
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.240
Help me!

39
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.000
Help me!

40
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.600
What do you want me to say?
You betrayed me.

41
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.640
I betrayed you? Me?

42
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.000
Yes. You.

43
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.680
You answered their questions.
You betrayed me.

44
00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.280
I can tell you what's going to happen.

45
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.120
The Indians will release me

46
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.560
and I will be free again.

47
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.800
Bravo, my love. It was perfect.

48
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.040
Thank you, Juliette.

49
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.320
Constable! Detain that man immediately.
Don't let him leave.
