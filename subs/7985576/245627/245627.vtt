1
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,637
That's a big fella! Whoa!

2
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:15,668
- Looks great.
- Thank you.

3
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,921
Happy vacation, honey.

4
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,966
Manchurian tung oil!
Where did you get this?

5
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,968
Helen got it for me in Oslo.

6
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:27,805
There's enough here
to do the whole table and the bureau.

7
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,185
I wonder what this could be.

8
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:34,646
Oh, honey, you got it. Thank you.

9
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,940
Enough to do the entire guest room.

10
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:39,400
I'm so glad we're spending
our vacation at home.

11
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,362
- I'm gonna get started now.
- Where are you going?

12
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,535
- I'll get it.
- Be my guest.

13
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,500
- Maybe you should get it.
- I'll go.

14
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,132
Oh, no!

15
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,224
Jane.

16
00:04:12,268 --> 00:04:14,186
It's your turn, honey.

17
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:29,160
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks.

18
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,456
Hi, Barbara. I'm glad I caught you.
Heard you were on vacation.

19
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,041
That's right. Complete vacation.

20
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,918
Today I'm $260,000!

21
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,965
- It's 6:45 in the morning.
- This offer is real.

22
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:46,468
From a man in New York City
who only saw a photograph.

23
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,305
Jane, don't send people photos
of our house.

24
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:53,642
He wants to bring the wife and family
here for some peace and quiet.

25
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,519
That's what we're looking for.

26
00:04:55,603 --> 00:05:00,025
This house is too big for you.
It ought to be for a couple with kids.

27
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:05,155
I didn't mean anything.
But this house is too big.

28
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:09,075
- I'll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
- Think about it.

29
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,883
I was telling Barbara about this offer
on the house...

30
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:26,009
No, Jane.

31
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,894
Come with me to the store.

32
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:39,231
- What for?
- I need a new brush for the tung oil.

33
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,610
- And I want to get a part for the model.
- Just run in, okay?

34
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,049
Two weeks at home. The perfect vacation.

35
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:09,303
Jane says we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

36
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:12,348
I don't think it's any of Jane's business.

37
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,977
Besides, we could try again
on this vacation.

38
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,479
Really? What are you saying?

39
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:38,374
- How are you doing, Ernie?
- Hi, how are you?

40
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,802
Good morning, Adam.

41
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:51,471
- Need a haircut before your vacation?
- No, thanks, Bill.

42
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,223
- How's the model coming?
- Great.

43
00:06:53,307 --> 00:06:57,478
You know, Bozman built that foundation
in 1835. His grandson...

44
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:10,908
He's got hair down
to his goddamn shoulders.

45
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,203
He says to me, "Just trim it a little."

46
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,915
- I took the scissors to him so fast...
- See you later.

47
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:35,974
- This will be great.
- Wouldn't you rather go to Jamaica?

48
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:39,771
- No way. There's no place like home.
- Look out for that...

49
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:27,152
Perfect start to our vacation.

50
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:29,904
You'll feel better when you're dry.

51
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:34,618
That fire wasn't burning when we left.

52
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:38,998
- How's your arm?
- I don't know. It feels frozen.

53
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,185
I'll make some coffee
and you get wood for the fire.

54
00:08:59,268 --> 00:09:02,062
Maybe we should take things extra slow.

55
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:04,940
Do you remember how
we got back up here?

56
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:10,279
I'm going back to that bridge
and retrace our steps.

57
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,838
- You saved my...
- Two hours!

58
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:30,342
- You won't believe... What?
- That's how long you were gone.

59
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:34,429
- What is going on?
- I have to show you something.

60
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,140
Look.

61
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,608
There's that.

62
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,819
And there's that.

63
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,704
- "Handbook for the Recently Diseased."
- Deceased.

64
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,625
Deceased.

65
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:07,504
I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.

66
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:14,469
"Handbook for
the Recently Deceased Press."

67
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,391
You know what?
I don't think we survived the crash.

68
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,230
I hate this.

69
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,482
Can you give me the basics?

70
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:30,444
This book isn't arranged that way.
What do you want to know?

71
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:33,948
Why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch?

72
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,576
Are we halfway to heaven
or halfway to hell?

73
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,661
How long will this last?

74
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,038
I don't see anything about heaven or hell.

75
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:44,083
This book reads like stereo instructions.
Listen.

76
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,127
"Geographical and Temporal Perimeters.

77
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,839
"Functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation."

78
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:53,634
This is going to take some time.

79
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,745
Damn sandworms. Thirteen percent, huh?

80
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,457
I better find a job.
Let's see. Business section.

81
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:32,174
What do we got here? The Maitlands.

82
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,054
Cute couple. Look nice and stupid, too.

83
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,897
I wish I had a better view
of the cemetery from here.

84
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,983
I can't tell which is
the best placement for us.

85
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:56,865
Cabin fever?

86
00:11:57,282 --> 00:11:59,243
I can't clean anything properly.

87
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:02,120
The vacuum's in the garage
and we can't leave the house.

88
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,750
Why don't they tell us something?
Where are the other dead people?

89
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,961
Why is it just you and me?

90
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,588
Maybe this is heaven.

91
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,050
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on everything.

92
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:23,977
It's Jane.

93
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:29,566
- What's she doing here?
- I don't know.

94
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,526
Jane, up here. Jane!

95
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,951
She can't see you, right?

96
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,541
In the book, rule number two:
"The living usually won't see the dead."

97
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,920
- Won't or can't?
- It just says "won't."

98
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,966
God, this book is so stupid!
I can't understand anything in it.

99
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,803
Barb, honey...

100
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,055
...we're dead.

101
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,684
I don't think we have much
to worry about anymore.

102
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,470
This is great!
Just what the doctor ordered.

103
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:47,186
Sorry, ma'am.

104
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,399
Delia Deetz, welcome home.

105
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:54,152
Charles!

106
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:59,241
It's okay, there's no damage. See?
Good, sturdy, country craftsmanship.

107
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:03,912
Look at that kitchen. You'll finally
be able to cook a decent meal.

108
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,500
Come and have a look.

109
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:20,554
A little gasoline. Blowtorch. No problem.

110
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,723
Excuse me. Here we go.

111
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:37,320
We'll have to rip out all the plumbing.

112
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:40,532
Other than that, it's perfect. Just perfect.

113
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:44,620
- What do you think, honey?
- Delia hates it.

114
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,750
I could live here.

115
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,669
Careful! That's my sculpture.

116
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:54,964
I don't mean "my" as in "I bought it."
I mean I made it.

117
00:14:57,008 --> 00:14:58,843
Put it on the table.

118
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:10,271
Ten minutes. I'm already perfectly at ease.

119
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:12,607
It's perfect.

120
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,858
Help!

121
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,152
It's Otho.

122
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:19,655
Otho, why don't you come
in the front door?

123
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:21,449
It's bad luck.

124
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:24,452
You left the city for me. I am so happy.

125
00:15:24,827 --> 00:15:26,579
Of course you are.

126
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,417
Let's get one thing straight.

127
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:35,463
We're here to enjoy the country setting,
not to trash the place!

128
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:38,175
Charles, you're lucky
the yuppies are buying condos...

129
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:42,387
...so you can afford what I'm going
to have to do to this place.

130
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,934
I'm here to relax and clip coupons,
and, damn it, I mean to do it.

131
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:49,811
Then go do it quietly, dear,
and let Otho and me think.

132
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,022
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?

133
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,982
Is this a punishment?

134
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,902
What are we going to do?

135
00:15:57,778 --> 00:16:00,113
We're not completely helpless.

136
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:04,618
I've been reading that book and there's
a word for people in our situation.

137
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,411
Ghosts!

138
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:10,207
Let's get this show on the road.

139
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,838
We're dealing with
negative entertainment potential.

140
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,757
There's absolutely no organic flow through.

141
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:21,760
I noticed that, too.
It's like a giant ant farm.

142
00:16:24,888 --> 00:16:27,391
- What?
- I thought I saw something.

143
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:40,697
You've read my mind.

144
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,284
- I did?
- So few clients are able to read my mind.

145
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,953
They're not open to the experience.

146
00:16:55,086 --> 00:16:56,337
My God!

147
00:16:57,046 --> 00:17:01,176
We just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one.

148
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:02,677
Look!

149
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,430
Ozzie and Harriet.

150
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,767
- What happened to these people?
- They died.

151
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,936
Look, an indoor outhouse.

152
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:20,361
- Viridian.
- Viridian. Why do I know that name?

153
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:22,280
Blue-green!

154
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,034
Hydrated chromic oxide.

155
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,913
Remember, I'm schooled in chemistry.
I was a hair analyst.

156
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:30,581
- What?
- Briefly.

157
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:38,672
Deliver me from L.L. Bean.

158
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,720
I know what you two are up to and
you're not going to get away with it!

159
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:46,430
This is not working out.

160
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:50,559
I will not stop living and breathing art
just because you need to relax.

161
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,812
I'm here with you. I'll live with you
in this hellhole.

162
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:58,651
But I must express myself. If I can't
gut this house and make it my own...

163
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:02,321
...I will go insane
and I will take you with me!

164
00:18:04,532 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah. Well, maybe the house
could use a little remodeling.

165
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:11,664
But why don't you just leave
this room alone, okay?

166
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:13,916
Okay.

167
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,216
I'll get her.

168
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,926
So?

169
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,681
Once you cover the wallpaper, knock down
a few walls, this place might be livable.

170
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:30,559
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.

171
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,061
I forgot to lock the attic door.

172
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,863
- Did you feel something?
- When?

173
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,041
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.

174
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:59,504
I have a feeling there's something
very interesting behind this door.

175
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:03,425
Yeah, the ghosts of the people who died
in this house, and they want us out!

176
00:19:03,508 --> 00:19:05,427
Let's do them a favor.

177
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,322
My God, that was close!

178
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,034
I cannot watch this.

179
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,746
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people away?

180
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:34,457
- Honey?
- No, I'm not putting up with this!

181
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,386
- You don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.

182
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:57,730
Barbara!

183
00:19:58,314 --> 00:19:59,357
Adam!

184
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,528
Adam, help. I'm getting all yellow!

185
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:47,364
We're trapped in this house
with those people.

186
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:56,248
I can't believe we're eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechwan up here?

187
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:59,794
I plan to have a stroke from the amount
of MSG in this food.

188
00:21:00,044 --> 00:21:04,924
This is our first meal in this house,
so let's try to make it a pleasant one.

189
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:08,219
Don't bait your mother.

190
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:12,098
When we get settled, we'll build you
a darkroom in the basement.

191
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:14,726
My whole life is a darkroom.

192
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:17,228
One big dark room.

193
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:23,902
You were miserable in New York City,
and you'll be miserable in the sticks.

194
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:25,904
At least someone's life
hasn't been upheaved.

195
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:30,617
I'm happy here. Those people in New York
don't know what they're missing.

196
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:37,790
We could become The Summer Art Center
of New York.

197
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:40,752
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.

198
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,506
That's a very good idea.
That'll be very time-consuming.

199
00:21:45,048 --> 00:21:47,383
First the house.
Otho and I have great plans.

200
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:49,469
We should keep it the way it is.

201
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:50,929
Good idea.

202
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:59,480
The furniture truck is coming.
We must decide what goes and what stays.

203
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:02,566
Everything goes,
along with whatever's in the attic.

204
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:21,502
Careful.

205
00:22:21,752 --> 00:22:25,506
Tell me what you do and I'll tell you
why my husband will fire you.

206
00:22:26,924 --> 00:22:29,510
- Isn't there an index?
- No, nothing.

207
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:33,222
What's this?

208
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,064
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where...

209
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:45,026
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures.

210
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,279
Where's the fourth sculpture?

211
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:49,156
What are you doing?

212
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:57,873
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?

213
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,500
"Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?

214
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:03,753
"Having difficulty adjusting?
Call Betelgeuse."

215
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,342
There's no number or instructions?

216
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:12,512
Nothing. The "bio-exorcist." I don't get it.

217
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,518
Straight back.

218
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,732
Why don't you take a break
for half an hour?

219
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,088
Put that down!

220
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,049
What the hell are you doing?

221
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:50,009
- Listen to me!
- Jesus!

222
00:23:51,677 --> 00:23:55,097
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.

223
00:23:55,181 --> 00:23:57,517
Do you think I want to die like this?

224
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,741
Hi. How are you?

225
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,752
That little girl saw us.

226
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:27,672
- Nobody can see us.
- But she did.

227
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:32,970
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.

228
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:35,973
Yes, they were family. I was devastated.

229
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,475
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?

230
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,646
That's a skeleton key that will open
any door. Give that to your father.

231
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,859
You might mention I single-handedly
decorated that house.

232
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:50,737
If he needs any advice in that arena
have him come see me.

233
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,385
Don't worry. I locked the door.

234
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:35,408
Having trouble with the living?
Tired of having your home violated?

235
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,410
Want to get rid of them
pesky living critters?

236
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,456
Well, come on down and see me,
the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.

237
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,959
Yes, sirree! I want to tell you,
I'll do anything!

238
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,716
I'll scare 'em real bad.
I'll do anything to get your business.

239
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,677
Hell! I'll possess myself if I gotta!

240
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:58,056
Yo! I got demons runnin' all through me.

241
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:00,642
Come on down and see it.

242
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,937
If you act now, you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism.

243
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,980
You can't beat that, can you?

244
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:10,944
Bring the little partners. We've got plenty
of snakes for them to play with.

245
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,615
Say it once, say it twice,
third time's a charm. And remember...

246
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:19,119
"I'll eat anything you want me to eat.
Swallow anything you want me to swallow.

247
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:21,831
"So, come on down, I'll chew on the dog."

248
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,697
We need some help. I read something
in this book about emergencies.

249
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,784
Here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."

250
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,585
"Draw a door"? I don't know why
we keep looking in that stupid book.

251
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,966
Maybe we should try that Beetle guy.

252
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,526
You didn't actually think
that would work, did you?

253
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,947
"Knock three times."

254
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,554
Birdies!

255
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:49,605
Get it!

256
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,482
Dad?

257
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:55,152
- Can't you see I'm relaxing?
- I want to tell you what I saw.

258
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,991
What is the point of my coming here
if you people won't let me relax?

259
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,993
Pumpkin, sweetheart...

260
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,079
...go help your mother.

261
00:29:04,163 --> 00:29:07,207
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house,
but I can't.

262
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:14,381
Hmm, nice building.

263
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:16,550
Bad roof. Good parking.

264
00:29:48,457 --> 00:29:50,459
- Adam?
- This way, honey.

265
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:04,807
You don't have an appointment.

266
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:07,101
- We didn't know how to make one.
- Appointment for what?

267
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:09,187
- What do you want?
- Help?

268
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,233
Already? Just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help.

269
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,568
What does that have to do with anything?

270
00:30:15,652 --> 00:30:18,780
You'll use up all your help vouchers: D-90s.

271
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:22,617
You spend 125 years on earth
in that house...

272
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:27,413
...during which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.

273
00:30:27,497 --> 00:30:30,416
You probably haven't read through
the manual completely yet.

274
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,461
You'll have to wait if you don't have
an appointment.

275
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:37,131
- An appointment with whom?
- For Juno, your caseworker.

276
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,513
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock!

277
00:31:50,415 --> 00:31:52,918
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

278
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,505
I'm trying to cut down myself.

279
00:32:13,688 --> 00:32:16,566
Adam, is this what happens when you die?

280
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:19,778
This is what happens when you die.

281
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:23,114
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.

282
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:26,243
It's all very personal.
I'll tell you something.

283
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:30,497
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.

284
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,089
Maitland. Party of two.

285
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:40,758
Take the handbook
and go to the sixth door.

286
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:43,010
Oh, we forgot our handbook.

287
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:48,349
Come on.

288
00:32:54,188 --> 00:32:57,733
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

289
00:33:00,236 --> 00:33:02,947
Flight 409 is arriving at gate three.

290
00:33:04,073 --> 00:33:06,617
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side.

291
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:08,578
- You look fine.
- Fine.

292
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,664
Thanks. I've been feeling a little flat.

293
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:19,338
Will the Peterson party
report to door number nine.

294
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,801
Peterson party, please report
to door number nine.

295
00:33:25,344 --> 00:33:28,473
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

296
00:33:35,105 --> 00:33:37,608
125 years. I can't believe this.

297
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,569
I can't believe they didn't tell us.

298
00:33:43,447 --> 00:33:45,449
Oh, Adam, what is this?

299
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:52,039
That's the Lost Souls' Room.

300
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:55,501
A room for ghosts
that have been exorcised.

301
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:58,086
Poor devils.

302
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:00,422
That's death for the dead.

303
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:03,717
It's all in the handbook.

304
00:34:03,926 --> 00:34:05,385
Keep moving.

305
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,350
Five.

306
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,937
This is the sixth door.

307
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:24,948
Boy, this place just gets weirder
and weirder.

308
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:37,460
We're home!

309
00:34:38,419 --> 00:34:41,506
Look at this place! Everything's different.

310
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:45,468
All our furniture's gone.

311
00:34:46,135 --> 00:34:48,763
How long do you suppose
we were waiting there?

312
00:34:48,847 --> 00:34:50,348
Three months.

313
00:34:51,516 --> 00:34:54,519
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.

314
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:56,646
I do have other clients.

315
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:59,774
- Are you Juno, our caseworker?
- Yes.

316
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:02,944
I evaluate individual cases and determine...

317
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:06,322
...if help is needed, deserved and available.

318
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:07,490
Are you available?

319
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:08,616
No.

320
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:12,371
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.

321
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,499
What did you expect? You're dead!

322
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:19,837
We want to get rid of the people here.
We worked hard on this house.

323
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,923
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were...

324
00:35:23,007 --> 00:35:25,384
- More like you used to be.
- Yes.

325
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:27,178
But these people!

326
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:31,223
Things seem quiet here.

327
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:35,436
You should thank God
you didn't die in Italy.

328
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,313
The Deetzes.

329
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:40,608
- Have you been studying the manual?
- We tried.

330
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:45,404
The intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all.

331
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:48,532
Get them out yourselves! It's your house.

332
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,453
Haunted houses aren't easy to come by.

333
00:35:52,536 --> 00:35:54,955
- We don't quite get it.
- I heard.

334
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,874
Tore your faces off.

335
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:01,170
It's useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who can't see you.

336
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:03,672
- We should start simply?
- Start simply.

337
00:36:03,756 --> 00:36:06,676
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.

338
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,265
You should have been studying
those lessons since day one.

339
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:15,977
I've got to go.

340
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,605
What about that guy in the flyer, Betel...

341
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:23,193
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.

342
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,237
We might.

343
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,615
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.

344
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:31,868
What do you mean?

345
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,999
I didn't want to bring it up.

346
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:42,045
But rather than have you make
another mistake, I'll tell you.

347
00:36:43,255 --> 00:36:45,090
He was my assistant.

348
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:48,677
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own...

349
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,137
...as a freelance bio-exorcist.

350
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:56,101
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.

351
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:03,818
I believe he's been sleazing
around your cemetery lately.

352
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:08,531
The only way he can be brought back...

353
00:37:08,698 --> 00:37:11,450
...is by calling his name three times.

354
00:37:12,451 --> 00:37:14,537
But I strongly suggest...

355
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,790
...that you remove the Deetzes yourselves.

356
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:19,876
How do we contact you...

357
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:22,003
...if we need you again?

358
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:34,515
Oh, Adam, that guy's in our cemetery.

359
00:37:35,224 --> 00:37:38,853
She's right. We just keep this simple.
We can do this.

360
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,755
Hey, you, come here!

361
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:06,798
Hungry?

362
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,635
Come on. Hey, come here.

363
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:13,847
I got something good for you.
Come on over.

364
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:16,808
We'll have a little bite, something to nosh.

365
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:20,103
- Come here!
- Help me!

366
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:29,196
Maxie, haven't I always made you money?
That's the only real question.

367
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:33,784
Nobody made me money like you.
You were a demon until your nerves went.

368
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,911
It's just that...

369
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:39,873
...Winter River, Connecticut is,
if you'll forgive me, nowhere.

370
00:38:39,957 --> 00:38:43,126
Why would I want to invest that kind
of money in an old building...

371
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,881
...way the hell up there!
- It's not a building. That's the beauty.

372
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:50,927
The people don't know the value of their
property. I can buy the whole town.

373
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,888
Then we own a whole town
in the middle of nowhere.

374
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:55,849
Come and see.

375
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:57,642
And bring Sarah.

376
00:38:58,393 --> 00:39:02,063
All right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.

377
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,690
Just a minute.

378
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:08,111
Listen. Enough of this talk
about visiting, okay? I gotta go.

379
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:10,780
You take it easy up there, big fellow.

380
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:13,032
- Good-bye.
- Max, wait, wait.

381
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:18,913
Putz.

382
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,647
Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had Maxie Dean on the phone.

383
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:47,776
Dad's found a way of making money
while I relax, so would you scram?

384
00:39:49,737 --> 00:39:53,782
Your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her $300 sheets.

385
00:39:56,702 --> 00:40:00,206
This is so corny. Is this what
we've been reduced to? Sheets?

386
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:02,208
Think of them as death shrouds.

387
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,835
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!

388
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:25,689
God, how can he stand that woman?

389
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:35,242
Cut it out! I'm a child, for God's sakes.

390
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:47,212
- I feel so stupid.
- It's not stupid. We're ghosts!

391
00:40:47,796 --> 00:40:51,007
Do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman?

392
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:52,551
Moan louder.

393
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:02,227
Oh, God!

394
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:12,362
Sick. Sexual perversion.

395
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:15,782
Do that weird sexual stuff
in your own bedroom.

396
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:23,456
Ah, no feet.

397
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,431
Are you the guys hiding in the attic?

398
00:41:38,514 --> 00:41:40,016
We're ghosts!

399
00:41:41,517 --> 00:41:44,312
- What do you look like under there?
- Aren't you scared?

400
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:47,690
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?

401
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,401
Are you Night of the Living Dead
under there?

402
00:41:50,484 --> 00:41:52,820
Like all bloody veins and pus?

403
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:56,073
- "Night of the," what?
- "Living Dead." It's a movie.

404
00:41:56,157 --> 00:41:59,285
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.

405
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:02,455
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?

406
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,832
We're practicing.

407
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:08,669
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.

408
00:42:08,753 --> 00:42:11,172
How can you see us and nobody else can?

409
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:16,093
I read through that
Handbook for the Recently Deceased.

410
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:19,765
It says, "Live people ignore
the strange and unusual."

411
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:24,061
I myself am strange and unusual.

412
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:27,606
You look normal.

413
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:31,109
- You read our book?
- Yes.

414
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,404
- You could follow it?
- Yes. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?

415
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:37,032
- Trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.

416
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,827
You can't scare her.
She's sleeping with Prince Valium.

417
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:45,541
You did this?

418
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:48,210
You carved these houses and things?

419
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,047
And this used to be your house.

420
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:54,716
Why do you want to scare everybody?

421
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,719
We wanted to frighten you
so you would move out.

422
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:01,640
You don't know the Deetzes.

423
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:05,686
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.

424
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:09,565
- Why don't you leave?
- We haven't left since the funeral.

425
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:12,150
Funeral!

426
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:15,071
God! You guys really are dead.

427
00:43:17,907 --> 00:43:19,576
This is amazing.

428
00:43:21,494 --> 00:43:23,037
- I better go.
- Wait.

429
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:27,709
- Don't tell your parents we're here.
- Unless it will frighten them away.

430
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,086
Tell them we are horrible...

431
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:32,589
...desperate, ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing...

432
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:34,757
...to get our house back.

433
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:41,306
What if this is a dream? Can you do
any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

434
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:50,273
If you are real ghosts, you better get
another routine because those sheets...

435
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:52,150
...they don't work.

436
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:02,952
Ghosts.

437
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:05,580
You're telling me we have ghosts
in this house.

438
00:44:05,663 --> 00:44:07,958
Those pictures are of ghosts.

439
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:09,543
Ghosts!

440
00:44:10,169 --> 00:44:13,923
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party
tonight for seven people.

441
00:44:14,006 --> 00:44:17,551
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman
who writes for Art in America.

442
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:21,430
In fact, no one dining here
has not been in Vanity Fair except you.

443
00:44:22,056 --> 00:44:24,058
I told them you were too mean to be afraid.

444
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:26,185
Don't you dare speak to others about me!

445
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:30,356
Being embarrassed in front of the few
people who will set foot in here scares me.

446
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:32,816
So let's play family just for tonight.

447
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,783
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.

448
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:42,576
She's got photos.

449
00:44:43,285 --> 00:44:45,829
Adam, you have a photo of Bigfoot.

450
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:49,416
My photo of Bigfoot is a different story.

451
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,296
We've got to get some help. We've got
to contact Betelmeyer or something.

452
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,187
Look.

453
00:45:13,483 --> 00:45:15,360
It's him. Betelgeuse.

454
00:45:17,487 --> 00:45:18,655
Betelgeuse.

455
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,659
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.

456
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:25,203
Betelgeuse!

457
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:30,876
What happened?

458
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:34,171
I think we're in the model.

459
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:39,134
Look at that.

460
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:04,243
Where is he? What do we do?

461
00:46:08,456 --> 00:46:10,208
Looks like we dig.

462
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:42,406
It's about time!

463
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:54,127
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.

464
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,522
Adam. Babs.

465
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,826
You can pick 'em! Is this
a solid relationship? Do I have a shot?

466
00:47:26,034 --> 00:47:29,037
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?

467
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:33,584
It's beautiful! You picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.

468
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,753
It makes me want to kiss you guys!
Come on, give me one.

469
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:38,589
I beg your pardon!

470
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,842
Let's get down to business.

471
00:47:40,925 --> 00:47:43,678
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here. Who do I have to kill?

472
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,805
- Hold that for me.
- Whoa!

473
00:47:47,056 --> 00:47:49,434
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody!

474
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:54,272
Possession! Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.

475
00:47:54,355 --> 00:47:57,775
No. We just want to get some people
out of our house.

476
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:02,030
I understand. In order to do that,
I'll have to get to know you.

477
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:04,949
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.

478
00:48:05,033 --> 00:48:08,161
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying?

479
00:48:08,328 --> 00:48:10,246
Save that guy for later.

480
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,624
My wife and I have some questions.

481
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:14,709
Sure, go ahead. Shoot.

482
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:17,045
What are your qualifications?

483
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:21,049
Well, I attended Juilliard. I'm a graduate
of Harvard Business School.

484
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:24,677
I travel extensively.
I lived through the Black Plague.

485
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,639
I've seen The Exorcist about 167 times...

486
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:31,184
...and it keeps getting funnier
every time I see it!

487
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,188
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking to a dead guy!

488
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:37,441
Now what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?

489
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:40,236
Can you be scary?

490
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:43,864
Oh! I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?

491
00:48:45,824 --> 00:48:47,952
What do you think of this?

492
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:49,828
You like it?

493
00:48:50,913 --> 00:48:54,416
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourselves.

494
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:57,670
- Let's go.
- I know, but he can be useful later.

495
00:48:57,878 --> 00:49:00,881
- We can work something ourselves.
- Oh, yeah!

496
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:03,634
- Excuse me!
- What?

497
00:49:03,759 --> 00:49:05,553
We are leaving now.

498
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:07,263
Don't go yet.

499
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,101
Come on, we're simpatico.
Look at us. We shop at the same store.

500
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:14,436
Hey, hermano.

501
00:49:14,937 --> 00:49:16,730
Yeah, there you go.

502
00:49:18,524 --> 00:49:20,609
We're like peas in a pod.

503
00:49:20,943 --> 00:49:25,197
You want someone out of the house.
I want to get someone out of your house.

504
00:49:25,281 --> 00:49:28,618
Look! You've been to Saturn.
I've been to Saturn!

505
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:30,662
Whoa. Sandworms.

506
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:34,374
You hate 'em, right? I hate 'em myself.

507
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:38,461
Kids, what do I have to do
to strike a deal with you two?

508
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:48,889
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go, Barbara!

509
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:52,267
Come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on.

510
00:49:52,434 --> 00:49:54,686
- I'm not staying.
- The place is a mess.

511
00:49:54,769 --> 00:49:56,938
We have to get out of here.

512
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:58,940
Home! Home! Home!

513
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,152
How did you do that?

514
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:04,154
Hope you like Italian.

515
00:50:04,529 --> 00:50:07,240
Where'd you go? Hey, where'd you go?

516
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:09,910
Hey! You've got to work with me here.

517
00:50:09,993 --> 00:50:12,537
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?

518
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:14,164
Where are you?

519
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:16,291
You bunch of losers!

520
00:50:17,042 --> 00:50:19,920
You're working with a professional here!

521
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:25,968
Nice fucking model!

522
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:28,888
We can do this stuff on our own.

523
00:50:29,138 --> 00:50:32,350
Besides, I'm not exposing
that little girl to that pervert.

524
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:35,436
We did call him,
and he seemed awfully pissed off.

525
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,399
I don't care. I've changed my mind.
We can scare them off ourselves... tonight.

526
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,485
I have an idea.

527
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:51,994
What you did with the place is wonderful.

528
00:50:52,078 --> 00:50:53,621
Not me. Them.

529
00:50:55,164 --> 00:50:56,249
So?

530
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:02,797
You like them.

531
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:07,301
I hope it wasn't yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts.

532
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:10,429
You know what they say about people
who commit suicide?

533
00:51:10,513 --> 00:51:13,475
In the afterlife, they become civil servants.

534
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:18,730
Otho, I didn't realize
you were into the supernatural.

535
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:20,899
Of course! You remember.

536
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:23,694
After my stint with the Living Theater...

537
00:51:23,777 --> 00:51:27,364
...I was one of New York's
leading paranormal researchers...

538
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:29,366
...until the bottom dropped out in '72.

539
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:33,036
Paranormal? Is that what
they're calling your kind these days?

540
00:51:33,453 --> 00:51:37,958
Don't mind her. She's still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister.

541
00:51:41,169 --> 00:51:43,463
Well, this looks really good.

542
00:51:45,132 --> 00:51:46,884
I saw some ghosts.

543
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:56,727
- It's a private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.

544
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,148
Yes, it is. Just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted.

545
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,444
Kids! You know, I love them!

546
00:52:07,322 --> 00:52:10,033
- Ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.

547
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:14,454
I'd like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends...

548
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:17,624
...who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.

549
00:52:17,707 --> 00:52:19,751
May your buildings go condo.

550
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:23,963
Lydia, favor us about your ghosts.

551
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,758
No! I am sick of that subject.

552
00:52:27,008 --> 00:52:28,760
Delia, lighten up.

553
00:52:29,344 --> 00:52:31,513
I would rather talk about...

554
00:52:46,903 --> 00:52:48,446
That's cute, Delia.

555
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:02,836
Otho, are you doing this?

556
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:31,885
We did it!

557
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:35,305
Let's watch them scatter.

558
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:39,059
Any minute now they'll come
running out of that door screaming.

559
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,813
Any minute now.

560
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,615
It's me, Lydia.

561
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,912
They want you to come downstairs.

562
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,998
Delia says you can wear
any sheets you want.

563
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:04,794
It was like being in an amusement park.

564
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:06,087
Wham!

565
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:10,007
- I didn't know I could do the calypso.
- Who has more fun than us?

566
00:55:10,091 --> 00:55:12,802
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn.

567
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:16,722
A very sophisticated pair.
They even appear in sheets.

568
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:21,394
Charles, why didn't you tell us
about this before?

569
00:55:22,895 --> 00:55:27,608
We're not sure we want our secret out.
Everyone will want them for parties.

570
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,443
People will pay big money for this.

571
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:33,531
The Enquirer is offering $50,000
for proof of life after death.

572
00:55:35,366 --> 00:55:38,369
This is it, Charles.
You can get Maxie Dean up here now.

573
00:55:38,452 --> 00:55:41,540
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.

574
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:44,668
She'll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter...

575
00:55:44,751 --> 00:55:47,421
...if you can produce ghosts for her.

576
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:53,886
I should remind you that I'm Delia's agent.

577
00:55:53,969 --> 00:55:56,305
I have lost money on her work for years.

578
00:55:56,388 --> 00:55:58,974
If anything happened here, I shall handle it.

579
00:55:59,057 --> 00:56:01,393
But not until I've seen real proof.

580
00:56:01,476 --> 00:56:05,439
- What about this table?
- What do you call what just happened?

581
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:08,233
What money?
Don't you believe in my work?

582
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,652
Here's Lydia.

583
00:56:11,278 --> 00:56:13,906
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.

584
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:22,998
Why not?

585
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:28,879
I think they were trying to scare you away,
and you didn't get scared.

586
00:56:28,962 --> 00:56:32,216
They're dead.
It's a little late to be neurotic.

587
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:37,597
All right.

588
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:46,356
This was not a hallucination.
This was real.

589
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,403
We all experienced a super-powerful
paranormal experience and it was real.

590
00:56:53,112 --> 00:56:56,616
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.

591
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:01,538
If you insist on frightening people,
do it with your sculpture.

592
00:57:02,705 --> 00:57:04,374
Drive carefully!

593
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:06,376
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide?

594
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:08,836
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.

595
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:12,257
They're ghosts.
They can do what they want.

596
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,510
They do whatever they want.
Take us up there right now.

597
00:57:21,933 --> 00:57:25,103
Fabulous! Otho Fenlock's
"Locked Door Ghosts!"

598
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:26,938
Probably committed suicide up there.

599
00:57:27,021 --> 00:57:29,108
- I'm enchanted.
- In there?

600
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,278
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?

601
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:35,447
Open this door, Dead People,
or we'll bust it down...

602
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:38,033
...and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

603
00:57:38,117 --> 00:57:40,536
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.

604
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:44,248
I can teach you something here.
Take the upper hand in all situations...

605
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:47,209
...or people, dead or alive,
will walk all over you.

606
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:48,586
Open up!

607
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:02,516
Where are they?

608
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:04,977
These ghosts are nice people.

609
00:58:05,352 --> 00:58:09,023
I think we scared them away,
so let's leave them alone, all right?

610
00:58:09,106 --> 00:58:11,192
It's the whole damn town.

611
00:58:12,443 --> 00:58:14,945
I have never been so embarrassed.

612
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,781
Have they gone for good?

613
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,498
Dad, don't.

614
00:58:25,832 --> 00:58:27,626
Mom, let's just go.

615
00:58:40,347 --> 00:58:41,932
No ghosts here.

616
00:58:44,726 --> 00:58:48,313
Come on! If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.

617
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,443
We're leaving now.
You can go about your business.

618
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:58,448
- What are we doing?
- Quick, quick, quick.

619
00:59:05,705 --> 00:59:08,833
Oh, boy! You guys are really spooksters,
aren't you?

620
00:59:09,834 --> 00:59:13,463
Now, let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

621
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:19,887
Otho, get Maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.

622
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:24,016
We can turn this place into the world's
leading supernatural research center.

623
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,228
An amusement park. I'll do a presentation.
Lydia will bring the ghosts.

624
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:30,314
I can't bring the ghosts. They're not here.

625
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:34,110
- Otho, can't you do something?
- If I'm properly motivated.

626
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,532
What type of motivation do you require?

627
00:59:39,615 --> 00:59:43,494
Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.

628
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:33,587
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

629
01:00:34,588 --> 01:00:35,964
Stop! Stop!

630
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:50,521
- Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
- Oh, no!

631
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:54,566
Why are you doing this?

632
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,403
Leave me alone, all of you!

633
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:06,913
Great choice! We spend the next century
hanging out a window or doing tricks.

634
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,208
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.

635
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,418
- He could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.

636
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,963
We've got them where we want them.

637
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,012
You losers! How dare you interrupt
a professional while he's working!

638
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,807
I'm not fond of Charles,
but you could've killed him.

639
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:29,060
I'm just doing my job!
I thought we had a deal.

640
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,271
It's okay. You know why?

641
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:35,900
I don't want to do business
with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.

642
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:40,154
The only one I think I can deal with
is Edgar Allan Poe's daughter.

643
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,615
- She understands me.
- Leave her alone!

644
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:57,381
Go ahead, make my millennium.

645
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,517
I'm feeling a little anxious,
if you know what I mean.

646
01:02:08,976 --> 01:02:11,103
It's been about 600 years.

647
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,607
I wonder where an everyday Joe
like myself...

648
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:17,443
...can find a little action.

649
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,545
Yeah. Here I come, baby.

650
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:42,676
Hey, Adam, nice move!

651
01:02:44,345 --> 01:02:46,889
- Why did you build that?
- I didn't.

652
01:02:57,025 --> 01:02:59,361
Will you guys shut up and leave me alone?

653
01:02:59,444 --> 01:03:01,780
I've got all this paperwork to do.

654
01:03:04,074 --> 01:03:06,117
You two, come in. Sit down.

655
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:08,286
Get in here, both of you!

656
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:16,086
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.

657
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:19,381
You two have really screwed up.

658
01:03:19,881 --> 01:03:22,884
I heard you allowed yourselves
to be photographed.

659
01:03:22,968 --> 01:03:25,720
You let Betelgeuse out
and didn't put him back.

660
01:03:25,804 --> 01:03:28,181
And you let Otho take the handbook!

661
01:03:28,265 --> 01:03:29,432
When?

662
01:03:30,725 --> 01:03:32,727
Never trust the living!

663
01:03:33,311 --> 01:03:35,981
We cannot have
a routine haunting like yours...

664
01:03:36,064 --> 01:03:39,651
...provide proof that there is existence
beyond death.

665
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:42,822
Coach, where's the men's room?

666
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:46,534
I'm not your coach. He survived.

667
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:48,786
Let me get something straight.

668
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,497
- What's our curfew?
- Get out of here!

669
01:03:52,498 --> 01:03:55,084
Go on, get downstairs! Men's room!

670
01:03:55,668 --> 01:03:58,254
Are you kidding? Can't you read signs?

671
01:03:58,337 --> 01:04:00,131
I'll be right back.

672
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:14,520
Maybe this was a bad idea.

673
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:16,814
I didn't say anything.

674
01:04:18,774 --> 01:04:21,694
Who are we kidding?
You've never had a bad idea.

675
01:04:21,777 --> 01:04:22,945
Yeah?

676
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:27,742
This could all work out.

677
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:30,453
Home.

678
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:36,585
I'm not sure this is the right environment
for Lydia.

679
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:38,754
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.

680
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:42,049
You family types.

681
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:46,136
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean is coming tonight.

682
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,723
You have to sell these ghosts.
I can only do so much.

683
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,393
What are you going to do?
Viciously rearrange their environment?

684
01:04:53,477 --> 01:04:57,648
I know as much about the supernatural
as I do about interior design.

685
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:06,823
"I am...

686
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:08,367
"...alone.

687
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:20,170
"I am...

688
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,631
"...utterly...

689
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,007
"...alone.

690
01:05:25,551 --> 01:05:27,135
"By the time...

691
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:30,473
"...you read this...

692
01:05:31,182 --> 01:05:32,684
"...I will...

693
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,352
"...be gone...

694
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:37,689
"...having jumped...

695
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:41,818
"Having plummeted...

696
01:05:43,736 --> 01:05:44,863
"...off...

697
01:05:45,655 --> 01:05:47,824
"...the Winter River Bridge."

698
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,079
I don't care what it takes.

699
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:55,790
You get the Deetzes out of there now!

700
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:58,668
Wait a minute.

701
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:02,505
What are you going to do?

702
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:04,632
To scare them.

703
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:08,177
I want to make sure
it's not some silly parlor trick.

704
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:10,346
I'll go first.

705
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:34,330
Not bad. Not bad.

706
01:06:35,748 --> 01:06:36,790
Now you.

707
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:38,667
Go ahead!

708
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,184
You look great.

709
01:06:55,851 --> 01:07:00,022
Go clean house and don't forget
the photographs and the handbook.

710
01:07:08,864 --> 01:07:10,366
- Coach?
- What?

711
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:14,245
I don't think we survived that crash.

712
01:07:14,328 --> 01:07:15,997
How did you guess?

713
01:07:19,626 --> 01:07:21,545
Mr. And Mrs. Maitland?

714
01:07:26,299 --> 01:07:27,509
Hello?

715
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,470
- Where are you?
- Dead.

716
01:07:32,013 --> 01:07:33,848
Dead, dead, deadski.

717
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:37,394
Of course they're dead. They're ghosts.

718
01:07:37,477 --> 01:07:41,481
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.

719
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:44,442
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost, too?

720
01:07:46,486 --> 01:07:49,030
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.

721
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:54,160
You look like somebody I can relate to.

722
01:07:55,912 --> 01:07:58,790
Maybe you could help me get out of here.

723
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:01,877
I gotta tell you, this death thing...

724
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:06,464
It's creepy.

725
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:08,301
Here's my problem.

726
01:08:08,718 --> 01:08:11,971
I've got friends on the outside
I said I'd meet.

727
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,640
I have to be there in person.

728
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,059
So could you help me get out of here?

729
01:08:18,186 --> 01:08:19,896
I want to get in.

730
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:21,939
Why?

731
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:27,486
You've probably got your reasons,
but I can't do anything from here.

732
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:31,324
If you could get me out, over there,
maybe we could talk.

733
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:35,995
But to do that you've got
to say my name three times.

734
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:37,788
What's your name?

735
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:40,041
I can't tell you.

736
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:41,626
Why not?

737
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:46,214
If I tell you, you'll tell your friends,
they'll call me all the time.

738
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:50,384
I've got to go to shopping centers for
openings, sign autographs, that shit.

739
01:08:50,468 --> 01:08:53,554
It makes my life hell, okay? A living hell.

740
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:57,975
But maybe if you have a pen...
I know! Do you play charades?

741
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,061
- Yeah.
- Good.

742
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,397
Here we go. Ready?

743
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:03,982
Two words.

744
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:05,859
Right!

745
01:09:07,402 --> 01:09:09,530
First word, two syllables.

746
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,406
Look.

747
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:13,909
Turn around.

748
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,538
I don't know what your signal means.

749
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:19,289
Look behind you!

750
01:09:19,998 --> 01:09:21,708
Hi. How are you?

751
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,418
Beetle.

752
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:25,420
Got it. Now, two.

753
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:31,218
Breakfast? Orange? Orange beetle?

754
01:09:31,343 --> 01:09:32,844
Beetle fruit?

755
01:09:33,345 --> 01:09:35,055
Beetle breakfast?

756
01:09:36,098 --> 01:09:37,516
Beetle drink?

757
01:09:40,352 --> 01:09:41,854
Beetle juice?

758
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:44,565
- That's it!
- Your name's Beetlejuice?

759
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:48,068
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.

760
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:50,863
It was you, wasn't it? The snake.

761
01:09:52,030 --> 01:09:54,993
You kids and your imagination!
Just say it!

762
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:57,203
No.

763
01:09:58,997 --> 01:10:00,123
I want to talk to Barbara.

764
01:10:00,206 --> 01:10:03,376
You don't need to talk to Barbara!
Just say it!

765
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:10,925
Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.

766
01:10:11,009 --> 01:10:14,429
But it's too late.
We have to go through with this.

767
01:10:14,721 --> 01:10:17,056
No, we don't. Can't we rebel?

768
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:26,274
I want to be with Lydia.

769
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,329
Come on! Just say it!

770
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:43,166
No, don't say it!

771
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,627
Say it!

772
01:10:46,252 --> 01:10:49,006
It's okay. It's us. What's going on?

773
01:10:50,424 --> 01:10:51,717
Beetle...

774
01:10:52,218 --> 01:10:55,763
He said if I let him out he would
take me to the other side to find you.

775
01:10:55,846 --> 01:10:57,765
No, Lydia, we're dead.

776
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:02,311
- I want to be dead, too.
- No!

777
01:11:10,945 --> 01:11:13,864
Being dead doesn't make things any easier.

778
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:17,910
Listen to her on this.
This is something we know a lot about.

779
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:21,705
And you can visit us anytime you want.

780
01:11:23,332 --> 01:11:27,127
I have a feeling things are going
to be better from now on.

781
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:30,172
What do you mean, better?

782
01:11:30,381 --> 01:11:34,510
We've decided we're going to invite
you and your family to stay.

783
01:11:35,636 --> 01:11:37,096
That's right.

784
01:11:42,561 --> 01:11:45,897
- Can't we bring Maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this, too.

785
01:11:45,981 --> 01:11:50,694
This is a presentation. It requires
a sense of occasion, a sense of style.

786
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:53,405
- It's big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional.

787
01:11:53,488 --> 01:11:55,323
- Wait, there are plugs.
- Careful!

788
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:56,741
Okay, go.

789
01:11:58,577 --> 01:12:01,705
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

790
01:12:01,788 --> 01:12:03,206
Be careful.

791
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:07,043
We've got Ed Cornwell
to head the wax museum...

792
01:12:07,127 --> 01:12:11,214
...dedicated to 50 great moments
of the paranormal in Thanksgiving Park.

793
01:12:11,298 --> 01:12:13,174
You must remember Ed.

794
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:17,888
He's the genius who gave us
the talking Marcel Marceau statue.

795
01:12:19,598 --> 01:12:23,184
And D-Con is on its knees
to sponsor the insect zoo...

796
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:26,688
...in the old hardware store.

797
01:12:27,063 --> 01:12:28,481
We can't lose!

798
01:12:34,738 --> 01:12:39,160
Lydia, you decided to join us.
I just finished the initial presentation.

799
01:12:39,243 --> 01:12:41,787
Now it's time to have a stretch...

800
01:12:42,288 --> 01:12:45,625
...and to invite our friends
to meet your friends.

801
01:12:46,292 --> 01:12:48,044
Are they here yet?

802
01:12:48,377 --> 01:12:51,172
Charles, we're here to see some ghosts.

803
01:12:53,257 --> 01:12:55,426
They're not here... anymore.

804
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:02,308
Every time she says that, the paint peels...

805
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:05,394
...and some wild creature tries to kill us.

806
01:13:06,938 --> 01:13:09,190
But we have pictures, Lydia.

807
01:13:09,357 --> 01:13:12,360
Really. They said they'd come back
and we could all live here...

808
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:16,614
...if you agreed not to tease them
or make them do stupid tricks.

809
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:20,034
She has a tendency to overreact.

810
01:13:20,535 --> 01:13:23,996
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have Otho.

811
01:13:27,291 --> 01:13:30,587
- Are they still here?
- Otho, are they still here?

812
01:13:30,796 --> 01:13:33,924
They're still here. They're just hiding out.

813
01:13:34,633 --> 01:13:37,219
They probably feel guilty
about what they did to me.

814
01:13:37,302 --> 01:13:39,221
They're sorry they didn't kill you.

815
01:13:39,304 --> 01:13:41,348
I just want to see them.

816
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:45,352
Otho, can you do it?

817
01:13:45,477 --> 01:13:48,605
- It'll be tricky, but I think I can handle it.
- No!

818
01:13:53,527 --> 01:13:56,989
What am I worried about?
You can't even change a tire.

819
01:13:59,908 --> 01:14:02,661
I'll be needing
something personal of theirs.

820
01:14:02,744 --> 01:14:04,913
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

821
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,209
Excuse me.

822
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:23,516
The wedding clothes.

823
01:14:25,184 --> 01:14:26,561
The words:

824
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:36,529
"Hands vermilion

825
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:38,531
"Start of five

826
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:40,867
"Bright cotillion

827
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:43,453
"Raven's dive

"Nightshade's promise

829
01:14:46,789 --> 01:14:48,374
"Spirits strive

830
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:52,545
"To the living,
let now the dead come alive"

831
01:15:07,685 --> 01:15:08,978
Barbara?

832
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:13,483
"As sudden thunder pierces night

833
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,071
"As magic wonder mad affright

834
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,865
"Rives asunder man's delight

835
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:23,285
"Our ghost, our corpse

"And we rise to be"

837
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:37,424
Help!

838
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:47,142
Stop it!

839
01:15:49,895 --> 01:15:51,730
"As flies the lizard

840
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:53,107
"Serpent fell

"The buried, dead and slain rise again"

843
01:16:47,037 --> 01:16:49,122
What's happening to them?

844
01:16:50,415 --> 01:16:51,666
I don't know.

845
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:54,794
They're dying!

846
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:57,589
They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.

847
01:16:58,465 --> 01:17:01,551
- That's not true! Look at them!
- That's enough.

848
01:17:01,635 --> 01:17:03,346
Can we stop this?

849
01:17:05,389 --> 01:17:07,975
It's too late, Charles. I'm sorry.

850
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,444
Where are you? Help them, please.

851
01:17:22,573 --> 01:17:25,868
Sure, I can help them.
But you've got to help me.

852
01:17:25,952 --> 01:17:28,913
- What?
- I'm what you call an illegal alien.

853
01:17:29,038 --> 01:17:32,708
I want out for good.
To do that, I've gotta get married.

854
01:17:34,627 --> 01:17:38,714
These aren't my rules. Come to think of it,
I don't have any rules.

855
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,883
Come on.

856
01:17:41,592 --> 01:17:44,637
Think of it as a marriage of inconvenience.
We both get something.

857
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,724
I get out. You get the most
eligible bachelor since Valentino.

858
01:17:49,016 --> 01:17:51,561
- We're even.
- Okay, just help them.

859
01:17:54,855 --> 01:17:56,024
Sure.

860
01:18:06,535 --> 01:18:07,995
Beetlejuice.

861
01:18:16,378 --> 01:18:17,963
It's show time.

862
01:18:35,606 --> 01:18:37,524
Attention, K-Mart shoppers:

863
01:18:48,661 --> 01:18:53,124
I'm back. I feel real good about myself.
You know what I mean? So...

864
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,293
...without further delay...

865
01:18:56,711 --> 01:18:58,671
...welcome to Winter River!

866
01:18:58,755 --> 01:19:00,798
Museum of Natural Greed!

867
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:03,218
A monument to the bored businessman.

868
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:07,055
Come a little closer.
Step right up! Test your strength.

869
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:30,620
Thank you.

870
01:19:30,745 --> 01:19:32,455
Thank you! Whew!

871
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:37,460
That is why I won't do
two shows a night anymore, babe.

872
01:19:37,919 --> 01:19:39,504
I won't do 'em.

873
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:42,591
Well, what have we got here tonight, kids?

874
01:19:45,553 --> 01:19:47,596
We've got the Maitlands.

875
01:19:47,846 --> 01:19:50,766
I think they've had enough exercise
for tonight.

876
01:19:57,773 --> 01:20:00,859
Not so fast, Round Boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.

877
01:20:21,338 --> 01:20:22,673
Mom, Dad:

878
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:28,679
I just want you two to know
you're welcome in our house...

879
01:20:28,762 --> 01:20:31,056
...anytime you want to come over.

880
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:34,018
In the meantime, the dowry's on me, Dad.

881
01:20:38,315 --> 01:20:42,819
The Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be back to normal.

882
01:20:47,908 --> 01:20:49,242
Shall we?

883
01:20:59,628 --> 01:21:02,005
Called the caterer. He's got a great band.

884
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:04,883
We're gonna need witnesses. Would you?

885
01:21:55,309 --> 01:21:57,520
Let's get on with the ceremony.

886
01:21:57,603 --> 01:21:59,188
Do you, Betel...

887
01:22:00,773 --> 01:22:04,277
- Nobody says the "B" word.
- Do you take this woman...

888
01:22:04,944 --> 01:22:07,071
...to be your wedded wife?

889
01:22:07,947 --> 01:22:10,533
I don't know. It's a big decision.

890
01:22:10,616 --> 01:22:14,495
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it only once.

891
01:22:15,454 --> 01:22:16,873
Sure. Go ahead.

892
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:19,500
And do you, Lydia, take this man...

893
01:22:20,167 --> 01:22:21,627
No! Betel...

894
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,967
She's a little nervous.
Maybe I should answer for her.

895
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:29,052
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound mind.

896
01:22:29,136 --> 01:22:31,680
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me.

897
01:22:31,763 --> 01:22:34,766
I'm answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine.

898
01:22:35,434 --> 01:22:36,476
Come on.

899
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,773
Come on.

900
01:22:42,983 --> 01:22:44,359
Betelgeu...

901
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:51,200
Scram!

902
01:22:53,035 --> 01:22:54,328
Come on!

903
01:22:55,996 --> 01:22:57,331
Hey, guy.

904
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,920
May we continue with the ceremony?

905
01:23:05,631 --> 01:23:07,549
- Then by...
- Betelgeuse.

906
01:23:17,518 --> 01:23:18,770
Strike!

907
01:23:22,023 --> 01:23:23,441
Let's roll!

908
01:23:23,691 --> 01:23:26,319
Then by the authority vested in me...

909
01:23:26,986 --> 01:23:29,614
- The ring, please.
- The ring! Oh, no!

910
01:23:37,664 --> 01:23:39,457
I've got it, honey.

911
01:23:55,515 --> 01:23:57,600
Here it is. Here you go.

912
01:23:58,226 --> 01:24:01,145
She meant nothing to me. Nothing at all!

913
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,905
- I now pronounce you...
- Yeah, come on.

914
01:24:11,782 --> 01:24:13,117
Man and...

915
01:25:12,552 --> 01:25:15,096
- What time is it?
- It's about 3:30.

916
01:25:16,431 --> 01:25:18,266
Give or take a year.

917
01:25:24,856 --> 01:25:26,024
Well?

918
01:25:27,275 --> 01:25:28,360
Did you get the paints?

919
01:25:28,443 --> 01:25:31,947
Yes. And I took pictures
of the new town hall for you, too.

920
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,949
How was the science test?

921
01:25:34,032 --> 01:25:37,118
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.

922
01:25:37,202 --> 01:25:40,622
I told them "no way." I said it was
against my religion. I got a "C."

923
01:25:40,705 --> 01:25:42,457
And the math test?

924
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:48,421
You're kidding me? We spent
the whole week studying for that test.

925
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:50,257
I got an "A."

926
01:25:50,507 --> 01:25:51,883
So, can I?

927
01:25:52,551 --> 01:25:55,554
I don't know.
Got a "C" on the science test.

928
01:25:57,348 --> 01:26:00,268
Don't tease her.
You never got on "A" in science...

929
01:26:04,981 --> 01:26:06,274
Come on.

930
01:26:07,942 --> 01:26:09,193
Well...

931
01:26:10,236 --> 01:26:11,696
...I suppose.

932
01:26:28,296 --> 01:26:30,381
This reads like stereo instructions.

933
01:26:30,464 --> 01:26:33,175
Sounds like Lydia got an "A"
on the math test.

934
01:26:35,469 --> 01:26:36,929
He likes it.

935
01:27:17,638 --> 01:27:19,973
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.

936
01:27:21,892 --> 01:27:23,101
Women.

937
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:26,647
I don't know what her problem is.

938
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:28,857
Normally, chicks...

939
01:27:43,498 --> 01:27:45,458
Pardon me. Did you do that?

940
01:27:45,542 --> 01:27:46,918
Nice work.

941
01:27:47,126 --> 01:27:49,212
How do you get them so small?

942
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,256
There goes Elvis! Yo, King!

943
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:56,177
Well, looks like I'm next.

944
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:02,850
Good thing. I've got to do a photo shoot
for G.Q. In an hour and a half.

945
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:07,730
They've been after me for months.
Some kind of underwear deal.

946
01:28:09,399 --> 01:28:12,318
What are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.

947
01:28:12,402 --> 01:28:14,487
Come on! Whoa! Stop it!

948
01:28:18,074 --> 01:28:20,451
This might be a good look for me.

949
