00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:52.258
{\An8}

2
00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:01.225
{\an8}Good morning,
Mr. Basset.

3
00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.227
{\An8}This is your
wake-up call.

4
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.021
{\An8}Please move your ass.

5
00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.025
{\An8}

6
00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:21.579
{\an8}Stampede!

7
00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:23.289
{\An8}Stampede, Earl!

8
00:01:23.373 --> 00:01:25.416
{\An8}Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

9
00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:26.959
{\An8}

10
00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:31.297
{\an8}You dumb shit.

11
00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:33.549
{\An8}

12
00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.635
{\an8}I was in
a stampede once.

13
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:40.306
{\An8}Three hundred head going
hell-bent for the horizon.

14
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.350
{\An8}Now, exactly
how many cows

15
00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.602
{\an8}are required for
a stampede, Earl?

16
00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:45.937
{\An8}I mean, is it like
three or more?

17
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.106
{\An8}Is there
a minimum speed?

18
00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.191
{\An8}I wish a stampede
up your ass.

19
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.601
No breakfast?

20
00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:27.561
I did it yesterday.
It was bologna and beans.

21
00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.773
No. It was eggs.

22
00:02:30.857 --> 00:02:33.568
I did eggs, over easy.

23
00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:34.986
The hell you did.

24
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.572
Bologna and beans.
It's your turn.

25
00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:48.875
{\An8}Well, I guess
when I'm your age,

26
00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:51.126
{\an8}I'll forget
what I eat, too.

27
00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:58.384
{\An8}Oh, God damn it!

28
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:02.472
{\An8}I ask you, is this a job
for intelligent men?

29
00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:04.306
{\An8}Show me one.
I'll ask him.

30
00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.310
{\An8}I mean, if we were
real serious about money,

31
00:03:07.394 --> 00:03:08.645
{\an8}we'd quit being
hired hands...

32
00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:11.731
{\an8}Handymen, Earl.
We are handymen.

33
00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.526
{\An8}Yeah, yeah. We
should quit this job and

34
00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.694
{\an8}find ourselves
some real employment.

35
00:03:16.778 --> 00:03:19.363
{\An8}Are you gonna give up
all this personal freedom?

36
00:03:19.447 --> 00:03:20.739
{\An8}I don't know.

37
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.213
Freeway!

38
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.800
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

39
00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:39.967
It's garbage day.

40
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:42.678
Oh, man! Already?

41
00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:44.972
Hey, what's Nestor
paying us?

42
00:03:45.557 --> 00:03:48.810
50 bucks. And that's 47
bucks more than we got.

43
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:50.728
Burt and Heather's place
is closer.

44
00:03:50.812 --> 00:03:54.232
Let's do their linoleum today
and do the garbage tomorrow.

45
00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:55.566
Nestor's not home tomorrow.

46
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.693
Now, look, we don't dig
today, we don't get paid today.

47
00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.279
Now, damn it, Valentine,
you never plan ahead.

48
00:04:00.363 --> 00:04:01.405
You never take
the long view.

49
00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.034
I mean, here it is Monday, and
I'm already thinking of Wednesday.

50
00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.995
It is Monday, right?

51
00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:12.500
Hey,
who the hell's that?

52
00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:14.419
That's not what's-his-name,
the grad student?

53
00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:16.420
No. He graduated.
Must be the new one.

54
00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:17.922
The new one?

55
00:04:19.382 --> 00:04:21.384
That's supposed
to be a girl.

56
00:04:29.058 --> 00:04:31.935
You will have long,
blonde hair,

57
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.106
big, green eyes,
world-class breasts,

58
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.485
ass that won't quit and
legs that go all the way up!

59
00:04:48.703 --> 00:04:51.956
Hi! I'm Rhonda.
Rhonda LeBeck.

60
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.458
I'm up here
for the semester.

61
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:54.542
Yeah, geography.

62
00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:55.877
Geology.

63
00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.587
Yeah, well,
actually seismology.

64
00:04:58.671 --> 00:04:59.922
Earthquakes.

65
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:01.882
And you two must
be Val and Earl.

66
00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:03.217
I've heard all about you.

67
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:04.635
We deny everything.

68
00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:08.597
Hey, listen,
I've got a question for you.

69
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.642
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling or blasting

70
00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:13.310
or anything like that?

71
00:05:14.562 --> 00:05:17.147
Around here?
No, ma'am.

72
00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:21.068
Well, I'm supposed to monitor
the seismographs.

73
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.655
You know,
they measure vibrations.

74
00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.824
Vibrations
in the ground.

75
00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:28.034
Yeah.

76
00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:31.829
Well, I've been getting
some really strange readings.

77
00:05:31.913 --> 00:05:34.081
I mean, the school's had these
machines up here for three years,

78
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:36.167
and we've never recorded
anything like this.

79
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:39.837
Well, we'll ask around. You know,
see if anyone's heard anything.

80
00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:41.839
Thanks.

81
00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:43.299
God, I hope
they're not broken.

82
00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:46.010
I might have to bag
the whole semester.

83
00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:49.222
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

84
00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:50.931
No problem.

85
00:05:51.015 --> 00:05:53.600
Nice meeting you. Hope
you get it all sorted out.

86
00:06:09.284 --> 00:06:12.453
You know, if you wanted,
we could take a look at those

87
00:06:13.788 --> 00:06:15.790
seismographs for her
if you want.

88
00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.376
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

89
00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:19.918
Nothing.

90
00:06:20.003 --> 00:06:21.921
It sure might be a slick
way to get to know her.

91
00:06:22.005 --> 00:06:23.131
Why?

92
00:06:23.798 --> 00:06:25.382
Damn it, Valentine.

93
00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:26.800
You don't go for any gal
unless she fits

94
00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.137
that stupid list of yours
from top to bottom.

95
00:06:29.262 --> 00:06:31.806
Well, sure!
- Yeah, and it's dumber than my hind end.

96
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.143
I mean, like that
Bobby Lynn Dexter.

97
00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:37.728
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

98
00:06:37.812 --> 00:06:41.065
It don't matter. They're
all the same, dead weight.

99
00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:42.900
"Ooh! I broke a nail!"

100
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.029
Makes my skin crawl.

101
00:06:46.112 --> 00:06:48.697
Well, I'm a victim
of circumstance.

102
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.535
I thought you call it
your pecker.

103
00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:26.277
Hey, pizza face!

104
00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.154
Melvin?

105
00:07:28.237 --> 00:07:31.031
Melvin! You touch
that truck and die.

106
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.660
Oh, man,
I'm really shaking.

107
00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:38.622
Thanks, Walter.

108
00:07:38.706 --> 00:07:39.873
Look, these are
hollow points,

109
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:41.542
but they're not
Hydrashok hollow points.

110
00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:43.044
Excuse me, I thought
bullets were bullets.

111
00:07:43.127 --> 00:07:44.461
Hi, guys.
What you been doing?

112
00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:47.839
We ran into that new college
student, that Rona.

113
00:07:47.924 --> 00:07:51.802
Rhonda. Yeah, she's
having trouble with her, uh,

114
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.138
uh, things.

115
00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:56.515
You know,
those college kids

116
00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.143
turn up oil or uranium
or something out there.

117
00:07:59.227 --> 00:08:01.354
Next thing the feds
will be at our door.

118
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:05.023
"Sorry. Time to move.
Eminent domain."

119
00:08:05.108 --> 00:08:06.526
Down, honey. Down.

120
00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:09.278
Yeah, Burt.
The way you worry,

121
00:08:09.362 --> 00:08:12.948
you'll have a heart attack before you
get a chance to survive World War Ill.

122
00:08:13.032 --> 00:08:14.491
We'll see.
We'll see.

123
00:08:17.704 --> 00:08:20.164
Hey, guys, listen.
Bearing going out.

124
00:08:20.248 --> 00:08:21.916
What do you think?
- Could be.

125
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.669
Catch you later, Chang.
We got a schedule to keep.

126
00:08:24.752 --> 00:08:27.296
Oh, yeah.
See, we plan ahead.

127
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.257
That way we don't do anything
right now. Earl explained it to me.

128
00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:20.534
Cocktail?

129
00:10:20.618 --> 00:10:21.910
You bet.

130
00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:29.752
Well, I'll tell you.

131
00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:33.047
Nobody handles garbage
better than we do.

132
00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.215
Yep.

133
00:10:36.217 --> 00:10:39.553
Oh, come on, Earl.
Now this is low.

134
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:43.057
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

135
00:10:48.062 --> 00:10:49.897
Hey, Melvin, why don't
you give us a hand?

136
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:52.817
Most of this shit
is yours anyway.

137
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.653
Listen, run down to the store and
pick me up a six-pack. I'll pay for it.

138
00:10:56.737 --> 00:10:59.114
Son, beer is for adults.

139
00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:04.620
You know, not having a plan is
what keeps us doing jobs like this.

140
00:11:04.704 --> 00:11:08.165
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

141
00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:10.668
Are you gonna stand there
and tell me, in broad daylight,

142
00:11:10.751 --> 00:11:12.669
that I'm the reason
we're still in Perfection?

143
00:11:12.753 --> 00:11:15.380
You know how close I am to
leaving this place right now?

144
00:11:15.464 --> 00:11:18.008
I'll call that little bluff.
- How close?

145
00:11:19.594 --> 00:11:21.512
Shit!
- God damn!

146
00:11:23.222 --> 00:11:26.934
Jesus Christ!
God damn!

147
00:11:29.604 --> 00:11:31.355
Don't forget the TV.

148
00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:32.940
Hey, what's that
vacuum cleaner for, man?

149
00:11:33.024 --> 00:11:34.358
I like this
vacuum cleaner.

150
00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:35.985
Hell, you never use it.

151
00:11:36.068 --> 00:11:37.611
Well, it's good
for parts.

152
00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:41.157
And, besides, maybe
we'll hire a maid.

153
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.699
Now had you thought
about that, Earl?

154
00:11:42.783 --> 00:11:44.201
Get in the truck.

155
00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:54.503
Guys!

156
00:11:57.006 --> 00:11:58.799
Hey, guys, wait!

157
00:12:02.136 --> 00:12:03.345
Hi.

158
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:04.638
Sorry, Nancy.

159
00:12:04.722 --> 00:12:06.515
We're not delivering
firewood anymore.

160
00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:07.975
We're heading for
Bixby permanent.

161
00:12:08.059 --> 00:12:09.310
Oh, sure.

162
00:12:10.478 --> 00:12:12.480
Oh, my God.
You really are!

163
00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:16.566
Hey, Mindy,
what's the count?

164
00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:18.903
Six hundred and forty.

165
00:12:18.986 --> 00:12:20.654
Guys, look,
I don't need firewood.

166
00:12:20.738 --> 00:12:22.072
I have this big
order to fill,

167
00:12:22.156 --> 00:12:24.408
and I have to build
my new pottery kiln.

168
00:12:24.492 --> 00:12:27.745
Come on, it'll be at
least a month's work.

169
00:12:27.828 --> 00:12:29.621
I'll throw in lunches.

170
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.082
And beer.

171
00:12:38.297 --> 00:12:40.841
I can't believe
we said no to free beer.

172
00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:45.387
We did it! We did it! We faced
temptation and did not bend!

173
00:12:45.471 --> 00:12:47.264
God damn!
Praise the Lord!

174
00:12:48.182 --> 00:12:49.975
Now there's nothing,
and I mean nothing,

175
00:12:50.059 --> 00:12:52.102
between us and
Bixby but nothing!

176
00:12:53.187 --> 00:12:54.688
Yeah!
- Yeah!

177
00:12:58.067 --> 00:12:59.526
Hey, look at that guy!

178
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.361
Oh, that's one job
I'd never do.

179
00:13:01.445 --> 00:13:02.779
Working around
electricity.

180
00:13:02.863 --> 00:13:05.031
Hey, hold up.

181
00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:06.659
That's Edgar Deems.

182
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.702
Come on.

183
00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:11.371
No. He only wears
that one damn jacket.

184
00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:13.373
That's him,
I'm telling you.

185
00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.764
Man, oh, man, he sure
must've been drunk this time.

186
00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:32.184
Edgar, get your
butt down from there!

187
00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.984
Well, shit.

188
00:13:41.068 --> 00:13:42.736
We can't leave him
up there.

189
00:13:52.705 --> 00:13:54.123
Thank you, Edgar.

190
00:13:57.418 --> 00:14:00.587
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

191
00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:09.263
One of these days, you're
gonna have to get your ass

192
00:14:09.347 --> 00:14:11.015
on a wagon
and stay there.

193
00:14:11.098 --> 00:14:13.725
Jesus! It's not like I don't
have better things to do

194
00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:17.729
than to climb towers and
drag your hairy ass down.

195
00:14:19.732 --> 00:14:21.275
Jesus Christ!

196
00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:30.993
Was it
a heart attack, Doctor?

197
00:14:32.661 --> 00:14:34.037
No.

198
00:14:34.622 --> 00:14:37.666
He died of dehydration.
Thirst.

199
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.460
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

200
00:14:39.543 --> 00:14:41.336
That takes a couple
of days, doesn't it?

201
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.213
Maybe even three or four.

202
00:14:44.757 --> 00:14:47.092
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

203
00:14:47.176 --> 00:14:49.553
He sat up there and
just died of thirst?

204
00:15:07.988 --> 00:15:09.197
Hmm.

205
00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:03.544
You reckon he hated
Perfection more than us?

206
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.129
Do you suppose he
wanted to kill himself?

207
00:16:06.213 --> 00:16:09.090
Come on. Somebody
must've chased him up there.

208
00:16:09.175 --> 00:16:12.553
What, you mean someone who
ain't scared of a Winchester rifle?

209
00:16:13.387 --> 00:16:14.721
Then what'd they do?

210
00:16:14.805 --> 00:16:17.891
Camp out down below
and just wait for him to die?

211
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.061
What the hell?

212
00:16:36.368 --> 00:16:38.745
What the shit?

213
00:16:40.748 --> 00:16:42.166
Hey, Fred!

214
00:16:43.626 --> 00:16:45.294
Hey, there, old Fred!

215
00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:48.130
Hey, Fred!

216
00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:53.218
Fred!

217
00:17:04.605 --> 00:17:05.731
This is weird.

218
00:17:05.814 --> 00:17:07.565
This is real weird.

219
00:17:11.445 --> 00:17:12.737
Jesus!

220
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:14.531
What the hell's
going on?

221
00:17:14.615 --> 00:17:16.950
I mean, what the
hell is going on?

222
00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:27.794
Everybody get the hell
out of here!

223
00:17:27.878 --> 00:17:29.796
There's a killer
on the loose!

224
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.882
What?
- A murderer, man! A real psycho!

225
00:17:31.966 --> 00:17:33.884
He's cutting people's heads off.

226
00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:35.803
I'm not kidding!

227
00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:38.472
They're pulling
our chain.

228
00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.725
Yeah.

229
00:17:59.994 --> 00:18:01.161
What?

230
00:18:03.414 --> 00:18:04.665
Shit.

231
00:18:08.627 --> 00:18:11.004
Howard! Howard!

232
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.632
Carmine?

233
00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:25.185
Who could be doing it?

234
00:18:25.269 --> 00:18:26.979
I'm not accusing anybody.

235
00:18:27.062 --> 00:18:29.439
I'm just saying, some
of my cattle are missing.

236
00:18:29.523 --> 00:18:31.316
Are you serious?
Old Fred's dead?

237
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.609
Dude, something
like that.

238
00:18:32.693 --> 00:18:34.277
Come on, you're
bullshitting me, right, pal?

239
00:18:34.361 --> 00:18:35.403
What happened to Fred?

240
00:18:35.487 --> 00:18:36.696
No worse than Edgar.

241
00:18:36.822 --> 00:18:38.782
What happened to Edgar?
- You won't believe it.

242
00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:40.534
Here, I need one
of those candy bars.

243
00:18:40.618 --> 00:18:42.328
I don't believe this.
The phone is dead.

244
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:43.620
Walter, your phone
is dead!

245
00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:45.122
I didn't do it.

246
00:18:45.205 --> 00:18:47.457
Nestor,
what's happening?

247
00:18:47.541 --> 00:18:49.000
Somebody
killed old Fred.

248
00:18:49.043 --> 00:18:50.627
- What should we do?
- What's going on?

249
00:18:50.711 --> 00:18:52.629
Now, look, Val,
you gotta get to Bixby,

250
00:18:52.713 --> 00:18:54.297
and you gotta get
the police up here.

251
00:18:54.381 --> 00:18:56.299
And you gotta step on it.

252
00:18:57.551 --> 00:18:59.469
Consider it stepped on.

253
00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:07.728
Man, we decided
to leave this place

254
00:19:07.811 --> 00:19:10.480
just one damn day
too late, you know?

255
00:19:11.357 --> 00:19:14.193
Well, there's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

256
00:19:14.985 --> 00:19:17.821
Everybody we know between
here and Bixby is already dead.

257
00:19:17.905 --> 00:19:19.197
Look out!

258
00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:27.122
Ls there some higher
force at work here?

259
00:19:29.166 --> 00:19:31.501
I mean, are we asking
too much of life?

260
00:19:31.585 --> 00:19:34.296
Where the hell
are these guys?

261
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.757
What are they doing?
Blasting?

262
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.007
Hey!

263
00:19:38.842 --> 00:19:42.428
Where are you guys? It's not
like there's another road, asshole!

264
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:47.101
Val! Val!

265
00:20:12.126 --> 00:20:13.877
Jesus!
I don't believe this!

266
00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:15.379
You're hung up.

267
00:20:16.463 --> 00:20:17.672
I am not!

268
00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:23.469
You're hung up,
I tell you!

269
00:20:23.554 --> 00:20:25.556
You're gonna burn
the clutch!

270
00:20:35.482 --> 00:20:37.066
You know, you could
break an axle like that.

271
00:20:37.151 --> 00:20:39.027
Could you shut up?

272
00:20:39.111 --> 00:20:41.780
Hey, I don't need to
spend the night out here.

273
00:20:46.577 --> 00:20:47.828
Crybaby.

274
00:20:48.495 --> 00:20:50.246
- Could it have been coyotes?
- No way.

275
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.290
No.
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

276
00:20:52.374 --> 00:20:54.584
Hey, it's Val and Earl.

277
00:20:56.003 --> 00:20:58.171
They shouldn't
be here already.

278
00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:01.592
Thought you two
were in Bixby by now.

279
00:21:01.675 --> 00:21:02.926
You are never
gonna believe this.

280
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.428
Mom!

281
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:05.845
Oh, my God!

282
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.101
Oh, Burt, be careful.

283
00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:13.478
Unreal.

284
00:21:13.687 --> 00:21:15.105
Where'd you get it?

285
00:21:15.189 --> 00:21:16.523
I didn't know
we had it.

286
00:21:16.607 --> 00:21:17.691
It's disgusting.

287
00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:18.817
Some kind of snake?

288
00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:21.445
Looks more like
an eel to me.

289
00:21:21.528 --> 00:21:24.113
Eels live in the water,
don't they?

290
00:21:24.198 --> 00:21:25.532
Big mother slug, maybe.

291
00:21:25.616 --> 00:21:26.867
Don't touch!

292
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.702
Relax. It's dead.

293
00:21:46.345 --> 00:21:48.889
Hey, it must've grabbed us!
That's why the truck stalled out.

294
00:21:48.972 --> 00:21:50.348
Next time I tell you
I'm not hung up...

295
00:21:50.432 --> 00:21:52.934
Hey, wait.
This stalled out your truck?

296
00:21:54.228 --> 00:21:56.772
It'd have to be one
strong son of a bitch.

297
00:21:57.856 --> 00:21:59.065
Stinks, too.

298
00:21:59.733 --> 00:22:01.901
I'll give you boys
$5 for this.

299
00:22:04.112 --> 00:22:05.488
$20.

300
00:22:05.572 --> 00:22:06.656
Okay, $10!

301
00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.991
$15.

302
00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:11.077
Okay, $15.

303
00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:12.537
Damn right, $15.

304
00:22:12.621 --> 00:22:14.664
I don't believe you guys.

305
00:22:15.916 --> 00:22:17.542
Could be a snake!

306
00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:20.629
Some kind of mutation.

307
00:22:21.588 --> 00:22:22.755
Yeah.

308
00:22:25.884 --> 00:22:27.302
Whatever it is,

309
00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:32.808
just one of these couldn't eat up
Fred and his whole flock of sheep.

310
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:35.602
So you think there are
more of them out there?

311
00:22:49.366 --> 00:22:52.786
I'm dead. Let's put this
stuff up in the morning.

312
00:22:53.662 --> 00:22:54.788
No.

313
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:58.166
We have to go to Bixby
in the morning.

314
00:22:58.834 --> 00:22:59.918
The cinder blocks are in.

315
00:23:00.002 --> 00:23:01.378
Oh, the cinder blocks.

316
00:23:01.461 --> 00:23:03.588
Oh, my God!

317
00:23:03.672 --> 00:23:06.675
Just keep looking
at that beautiful sky.

318
00:23:06.758 --> 00:23:10.386
That's the sky that's gonna be over
our roof every night when we're done.

319
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.514
What if we don't
finish the roof?

320
00:23:13.599 --> 00:23:16.435
Then we can look at
the sky all the time. Huh?

321
00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:20.980
Oh, that damn thing.

322
00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:32.659
Maybe it's time we buy
a new generator, huh?

323
00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:41.000
It's gone!

324
00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:43.044
What do you mean,
it's gone?

325
00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:49.717
You sure this is
where it was?

326
00:23:49.801 --> 00:23:52.595
It was right here!
There's the cord.

327
00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:53.930
Hold this.

328
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.273
Yeah, maybe the
ground caved in.

329
00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:05.400
There's a lot of mines
and stuff around here.

330
00:24:05.484 --> 00:24:08.695
Well, don't then.
You don't wanna fall in.

331
00:24:16.578 --> 00:24:17.704
Let's go.

332
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.373
God, what is that stink?

333
00:24:23.335 --> 00:24:24.544
You hear that?

334
00:24:27.214 --> 00:24:29.716
Come on. Come on,
let's just go.

335
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.637
Let's go back to town or
something. Please, Jim!

336
00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:38.057
Maybe it's a geological thing or
something like natural gas or a geyser.

337
00:24:38.141 --> 00:24:39.559
They stink like that.

338
00:24:39.643 --> 00:24:41.227
Remember in Yellowstone?

339
00:24:42.229 --> 00:24:44.022
Jim!
- Something's got me!

340
00:24:45.232 --> 00:24:47.275
No, Jim, no!

341
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:49.986
Something's got me
down here!

342
00:24:51.613 --> 00:24:53.323
Oh, Jim!

343
00:24:53.407 --> 00:24:56.034
Oh, God! Oh, God!

344
00:24:56.118 --> 00:24:59.246
Get something! Get something!
Get me out of here!

345
00:25:05.002 --> 00:25:06.503
Jim!

346
00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:07.878
Something's got me.

347
00:25:07.963 --> 00:25:10.215
Oh, God!
Please get me out!

348
00:25:12.926 --> 00:25:14.218
Help me!

349
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.847
Jim!

350
00:25:38.744 --> 00:25:40.120
Oh, my God.

351
00:26:40.055 --> 00:26:41.139
Mindy, smile.

352
00:26:41.223 --> 00:26:42.682
Come on, honey.
Don't look so afraid.

353
00:26:42.766 --> 00:26:44.350
It's not gonna hurt you.
I promise.

354
00:26:44.434 --> 00:26:46.394
- Mindy, look up. Smile.
- Come on.

355
00:26:46.478 --> 00:26:47.645
Hold it.

356
00:26:48.563 --> 00:26:50.815
Melvin, get out of there!

357
00:26:52.734 --> 00:26:55.319
Old Chang, slick as snot,
and I ain't lying.

358
00:26:55.403 --> 00:26:57.488
15 lousy bucks.

359
00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.200
A man who plans ahead...

360
00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:05.367
Look, we arm ourselves, we
set perimeters, we stand guard.

361
00:27:06.998 --> 00:27:10.459
Any of those snake things show
up here, we make them extinct.

362
00:27:10.544 --> 00:27:11.545
All right!

363
00:27:11.628 --> 00:27:13.129
Come on, Burt,
get serious.

364
00:27:13.213 --> 00:27:15.632
Yeah! You make it
sound like a war.

365
00:27:15.715 --> 00:27:17.633
What have you people
got against being prepared?

366
00:27:17.717 --> 00:27:18.968
Where's the sugar?
- Rambo.

367
00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:20.970
Wait a minute.
Walter's got a CB radio.

368
00:27:21.054 --> 00:27:23.347
Why aren't you calling
somebody in Bixby? The police...

369
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:26.934
No. We can't reach outside the
valley because of the mountains.

370
00:27:27.018 --> 00:27:29.562
Melvin, you're next. Come
on. Sit down, look scared.

371
00:27:29.646 --> 00:27:31.064
- Okay.
- Yeah.

372
00:27:31.148 --> 00:27:34.943
The phone's out. The
road's out. We're on our own.

373
00:27:35.026 --> 00:27:37.153
You two are just
loving it, aren't you?

374
00:27:37.237 --> 00:27:39.405
Come on, Nancy. Let's don't
get personal about this thing!

375
00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:40.656
We gotta do something.

376
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:41.949
Hell, yes!

377
00:27:42.659 --> 00:27:44.661
We are completely
cut off.

378
00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:47.080
We got the cliffs
to the north.

379
00:27:47.164 --> 00:27:49.541
Mountains to the east
and the west.

380
00:27:50.792 --> 00:27:52.877
That's why Heather and me
settled here in the first place.

381
00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:54.879
Geographic isolation.

382
00:27:54.963 --> 00:27:57.173
Well, there's gotta be
some way we can get help.

383
00:27:57.257 --> 00:27:59.425
For God's sake,
this isn't the moon!

384
00:27:59.509 --> 00:28:02.094
What are you gonna do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

385
00:28:04.723 --> 00:28:07.517
Hey, there's
Walter's saddle horses.

386
00:28:07.601 --> 00:28:10.103
That's it.
You're welcome to them.

387
00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:12.981
Somebody could
ride to Bixby.

388
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.651
That's not bad.
That's not bad.

389
00:28:16.735 --> 00:28:18.403
Who's best on a horse?

390
00:28:29.164 --> 00:28:31.124
Walter, they
better be fast.

391
00:28:31.208 --> 00:28:34.211
We don't wanna be stuck
on a couple of canners.

392
00:28:34.294 --> 00:28:36.254
Those snake things
couldn't travel that fast.

393
00:28:36.338 --> 00:28:38.590
Shit, for all you know,
they could fly.

394
00:28:38.673 --> 00:28:42.176
Here, what do you want?
This colt or Edgar's old rifle?

395
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.469
Rifle.

396
00:28:48.767 --> 00:28:51.394
Hey, Earl. Here's some
Swiss cheese and some bullets.

397
00:28:51.478 --> 00:28:52.812
Thanks, Walter.

398
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.777
You guys all set?

399
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:01.737
Well, ready as
we'll ever be.

400
00:29:01.821 --> 00:29:03.072
Heather and I are
gonna drive around.

401
00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:04.490
We'll see if we can
find that college girl,

402
00:29:04.574 --> 00:29:06.325
tell her to get her
ass back into town.

403
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:08.327
Good idea. We'll swing
by the doctor's place

404
00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:10.454
and see if they went
into Bixby or not.

405
00:29:10.538 --> 00:29:11.872
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

406
00:29:11.957 --> 00:29:12.958
Y'all gonna have
to take something

407
00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:15.043
that packs more of
a punch than that 30-30.

408
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:18.087
Why don't you take
one of our Browning Autos?

409
00:29:18.171 --> 00:29:20.798
Or better than that, why don't
you just take my Model 70?

410
00:29:20.882 --> 00:29:23.384
It's .375 H&H mag.

411
00:29:23.468 --> 00:29:24.927
Thanks, Heather.

412
00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:26.845
Well, I hope we
don't need to use it.

413
00:29:28.682 --> 00:29:30.433
It's got me!

414
00:29:30.517 --> 00:29:32.018
It's got me!

415
00:29:34.312 --> 00:29:36.105
- Melvin!
- Grow up!

416
00:29:36.189 --> 00:29:37.857
Damn it, Melvin!

417
00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:40.318
He's only kidding.

418
00:29:40.402 --> 00:29:41.945
You came that close.

419
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:44.280
Too close.

420
00:29:44.364 --> 00:29:45.740
No more games.

421
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:51.537
Melvin, one of these days
somebody's gonna kick your ass.

422
00:30:31.202 --> 00:30:32.286
Doctor?

423
00:30:51.264 --> 00:30:53.182
Man, I hate
this shit.

424
00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:56.227
Wait a minute.

425
00:30:57.729 --> 00:31:00.523
The car's gone. We just
missed them, that's all.

426
00:31:02.984 --> 00:31:06.195
Where the hell's the goddamn
golden oldie coming from?

427
00:31:21.211 --> 00:31:22.378
What the hell's this?

428
00:31:22.462 --> 00:31:23.629
You got me.

429
00:31:34.057 --> 00:31:38.061
Okay, here's the plan. We
don't even stop. We ride like hell.

430
00:31:38.144 --> 00:31:41.063
Tonight we'll keep right on
going. We'll walk the horses.

431
00:31:41.147 --> 00:31:42.481
That is the plan.

432
00:31:42.565 --> 00:31:45.901
I mean, God damn, what
the hell are those things?

433
00:31:45.985 --> 00:31:47.903
And how could they bury
a whole station wagon?

434
00:31:47.987 --> 00:31:49.697
Why would they do it?

435
00:31:53.243 --> 00:31:55.828
Come on, boy!
Come on, git, git!

436
00:31:55.912 --> 00:31:57.663
Walter wouldn't know
a decent horse

437
00:31:57.747 --> 00:31:59.457
if it came up and
bit him in the ass.

438
00:31:59.541 --> 00:32:02.835
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. They
got wind of something they don't like.

439
00:32:02.919 --> 00:32:04.045
Git.

440
00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:09.300
Something's
going on here.

441
00:32:09.384 --> 00:32:11.636
I don't see
anything anywhere!

442
00:32:21.479 --> 00:32:23.772
Hey! Hey, you okay?

443
00:32:23.857 --> 00:32:25.859
Yeah, yeah.
What about my horse?

444
00:32:27.777 --> 00:32:29.570
What in the name of...

445
00:32:34.492 --> 00:32:36.118
That's how
they get you.

446
00:32:36.202 --> 00:32:38.120
They're under
the goddamn ground.

447
00:32:39.497 --> 00:32:41.081
Well, what the hell
are they?

448
00:32:41.166 --> 00:32:42.917
Sons of bitches!

449
00:32:55.722 --> 00:32:57.181
Must be a million
of them!

450
00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:00.601
Nope. Just one.

451
00:33:05.773 --> 00:33:07.065
Come on.

452
00:33:29.589 --> 00:33:31.299
He's gaining on us!

453
00:33:33.134 --> 00:33:34.260
Look!

454
00:33:37.597 --> 00:33:39.932
We can make it!
We can make it!

455
00:33:51.945 --> 00:33:53.529
Stupid son of a bitch.

456
00:33:54.614 --> 00:33:56.449
It knocked itself cold.

457
00:33:58.535 --> 00:33:59.953
Cold, my ass!

458
00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.454
He's dead.

459
00:34:04.707 --> 00:34:06.166
We killed it.

460
00:34:08.086 --> 00:34:09.670
We killed it!

461
00:34:09.754 --> 00:34:11.630
Fuck you!

462
00:34:15.426 --> 00:34:17.428
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

463
00:34:18.513 --> 00:34:20.848
Did you notice anything
weird a minute ago?

464
00:34:20.932 --> 00:34:22.642
I mean, it just...

465
00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.397
What's that?

466
00:34:28.856 --> 00:34:32.150
All right, together.
One, two, three.

467
00:34:37.198 --> 00:34:38.741
Jesus Christ!

468
00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.244
Does it smell like that
'cause it's dead?

469
00:34:56.175 --> 00:34:57.843
I don't see any eyes.

470
00:34:58.553 --> 00:35:00.763
Must be totally subterranean.

471
00:35:03.808 --> 00:35:05.351
And those tentacles.

472
00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:06.519
Yeah.

473
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.981
You know, I think they
shoot right out of its mouth,

474
00:35:11.858 --> 00:35:14.902
and they hook you
and pull you right in.

475
00:35:15.486 --> 00:35:18.071
Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else.

476
00:35:18.156 --> 00:35:21.117
Look, this is important,
you know.

477
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.659
This is like...

478
00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:24.579
Well, let's just say it.

479
00:35:24.662 --> 00:35:28.457
This is probably the biggest
zoological discovery of the century.

480
00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:30.918
Hey!
Hey, check this out.

481
00:35:34.213 --> 00:35:35.964
I found the ass end.

482
00:35:37.383 --> 00:35:39.885
Jesus, we really
caught something here.

483
00:35:46.142 --> 00:35:47.560
Wow!
- Man!

484
00:35:48.436 --> 00:35:50.312
That's one big mother.

485
00:35:51.314 --> 00:35:54.442
This must be the old boy had your
seismos working overtime.

486
00:35:54.525 --> 00:35:55.609
Yeah.

487
00:35:58.196 --> 00:36:00.823
Yeah, it must push
itself along with these.

488
00:36:00.907 --> 00:36:02.867
All of them
pushing at once.

489
00:36:04.452 --> 00:36:06.412
That's why it
moved so fast.

490
00:36:06.913 --> 00:36:11.042
I mean, this thing had sensors
tripping all over the place. No...

491
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:13.627
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this before?

492
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:15.587
Oh, sure, Earl. Everybody
knows about them.

493
00:36:15.672 --> 00:36:17.173
We just didn't tell you.

494
00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:20.050
Oh, hell, man, no one
ever saw anything like this!

495
00:36:20.134 --> 00:36:22.136
We're really
onto something here.

496
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.554
I'll tell you
one damn thing,

497
00:36:23.638 --> 00:36:27.391
old Chang don't get his slick
mitts on this for no measly 15 bucks.

498
00:36:27.475 --> 00:36:29.101
You got that right.

499
00:36:29.185 --> 00:36:31.770
All right, here's the
plan. We need a flatbed.

500
00:36:31.854 --> 00:36:33.063
Yeah, right,
with a winch.

501
00:36:33.147 --> 00:36:34.857
Yeah, five-ton maybe.

502
00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:36.442
No, no, no,
don't wanna winch it.

503
00:36:36.526 --> 00:36:37.818
Don't wanna winch it.
It'd tear it all up.

504
00:36:37.902 --> 00:36:38.903
All right, a crane?

505
00:36:38.986 --> 00:36:40.529
Yeah, a crane
with lifting straps.

506
00:36:40.613 --> 00:36:42.156
Hey. Hey, shut up.

507
00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:45.117
The way I figure it, there
are three more of these things.

508
00:36:45.201 --> 00:36:46.327
What?

509
00:36:47.578 --> 00:36:48.620
Three more?

510
00:36:48.705 --> 00:36:50.289
I've got seismographs
all over this valley.

511
00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:51.916
Now if you compare
the different readings.

512
00:36:51.999 --> 00:36:53.959
Here's one at
2:00 yesterday.

513
00:36:54.043 --> 00:36:55.461
But here's one
three miles away

514
00:36:55.545 --> 00:36:57.129
at the exact same time.
Now that's two.

515
00:36:57.213 --> 00:36:59.173
But here...
- Yeah, yeah. We'll take your word for it.

516
00:36:59.257 --> 00:37:01.008
Yeah, where's
your truck?

517
00:37:01.092 --> 00:37:02.468
Just beyond that hill.

518
00:37:09.183 --> 00:37:10.559
What? What?

519
00:37:14.647 --> 00:37:16.565
Damn prairie
dog burrow.

520
00:37:16.858 --> 00:37:18.818
Little sons
of bitches.

521
00:37:26.617 --> 00:37:28.076
Psst! Psst!

522
00:37:31.748 --> 00:37:32.999
This way!

523
00:37:36.043 --> 00:37:37.669
Up on that rock!

524
00:37:51.976 --> 00:37:53.894
Looks like the one
that grabbed our truck.

525
00:37:53.978 --> 00:37:55.062
Where the hell's
your truck?

526
00:37:55.146 --> 00:37:57.273
It's right over there.

527
00:37:57.356 --> 00:37:59.858
Oh, man, I don't think
we can make that.

528
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:03.945
At least
he can't climb.

529
00:38:08.868 --> 00:38:10.119
Oh, man!

530
00:38:11.162 --> 00:38:13.789
Live ones smell
worse than the dead ones.

531
00:38:18.085 --> 00:38:19.544
Phew!

532
00:38:32.934 --> 00:38:34.644
I got it. I got it.

533
00:38:34.727 --> 00:38:37.187
They're mutations
caused by radiation.

534
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.106
Or no, no, no.

535
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:40.733
The government built them.

536
00:38:40.817 --> 00:38:42.985
Big surprise
for the Russians.

537
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:46.906
Well, there's nothing like them
in the fossil record. I'm sure.

538
00:38:47.615 --> 00:38:51.327
Okay, so they predate
the fossil record.

539
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.789
That would make them
a couple billion years old.

540
00:38:55.873 --> 00:38:58.834
And we've just never
seen one till now.

541
00:38:58.918 --> 00:39:00.127
Right.

542
00:39:00.211 --> 00:39:03.756
I vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

543
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:11.264
Well, haven't seen
a sign for hours.

544
00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:15.184
Must be long gone.

545
00:39:15.268 --> 00:39:16.769
Yeah, must be.

546
00:39:18.104 --> 00:39:21.273
Hey, why don't you take
a little stroll and find out?

547
00:39:24.735 --> 00:39:26.611
We gotta do something.

548
00:39:37.164 --> 00:39:39.082
"We gotta do something."

549
00:39:39.166 --> 00:39:43.003
I don't know why "we" always
has to be "me" every damn time.

550
00:39:43.087 --> 00:39:47.341
We, we, we. What do I look
like? An expert on worms?

551
00:39:47.425 --> 00:39:49.718
Watch it, Valentine, it's
got a good six-foot reach.

552
00:39:49.802 --> 00:39:51.178
Thank you, Earl.

553
00:39:55.182 --> 00:39:57.058
Son of a bitch!

554
00:39:57.143 --> 00:39:59.061
Son of a goddamn bitch!

555
00:39:59.812 --> 00:40:01.855
Pardon my French.

556
00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:04.775
Shit! It's been waiting
here all this time?

557
00:40:04.859 --> 00:40:07.194
I mean, how's it know
we're still here?

558
00:40:08.654 --> 00:40:10.072
Well, it's got
no eyes, right?

559
00:40:10.156 --> 00:40:12.241
Sure as hell can't
smell us underground.

560
00:40:12.325 --> 00:40:14.118
I say it's
been listening.

561
00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:16.078
Of course!

562
00:40:16.162 --> 00:40:18.747
It senses
seismic vibration.

563
00:40:18.831 --> 00:40:20.332
It can hear
every move we make,

564
00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:23.252
especially on this rock,
it's a perfect conductor.

565
00:40:23.336 --> 00:40:26.005
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off!

566
00:40:35.848 --> 00:40:40.102
Well, I hate to be crude, but
I gotta take care of some business.

567
00:40:40.186 --> 00:40:42.188
- Me, too.
- Same here.

568
00:41:11.509 --> 00:41:12.718
Thanks.

569
00:41:14.303 --> 00:41:16.430
No problem. Anytime.

570
00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:30.819
Well, what's the plan?

571
00:41:30.903 --> 00:41:33.322
I think the first
thing we gotta do

572
00:41:33.406 --> 00:41:35.533
is see if old stumpy's
still out there.

573
00:41:37.743 --> 00:41:39.161
Can I borrow
that shovel?

574
00:41:39.245 --> 00:41:40.371
Yeah.

575
00:41:49.213 --> 00:41:51.381
Doesn't he have
a home to go to?

576
00:41:51.465 --> 00:41:54.176
That's why Edgar never
got down off that damn tower.

577
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.427
I think
I have an idea.

578
00:41:55.511 --> 00:41:56.929
You know,

579
00:41:57.013 --> 00:41:58.848
we're gonna have to come
up with some sort of plan,

580
00:41:58.931 --> 00:42:00.057
he's just gonna
wait us to death.

581
00:42:00.099 --> 00:42:01.892
Yeah, well, I was...
- Why don't we just make a run for it?

582
00:42:01.976 --> 00:42:03.519
We outran him yesterday.

583
00:42:03.602 --> 00:42:05.520
Run for it?
Running's not a plan.

584
00:42:05.604 --> 00:42:07.647
Now running's what you do
when a plan fails.

585
00:42:07.732 --> 00:42:09.859
Valentine, you're not even
trying to think of a plan.

586
00:42:09.942 --> 00:42:12.069
Well, it ain't like we got
a hell of a lot of options.

587
00:42:12.153 --> 00:42:15.364
There's always options. We
just gotta think of them, that's all.

588
00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:17.450
All right, well, why
don't you start thinking?

589
00:42:17.533 --> 00:42:19.952
Why in the hell do I always
have to do all the thinking?

590
00:42:20.036 --> 00:42:21.871
Who died and
made you Einstein?

591
00:42:21.954 --> 00:42:23.664
You guys know
how to pole vault?

592
00:42:29.253 --> 00:42:31.797
We just stay
where he can't get us,

593
00:42:32.631 --> 00:42:34.382
on these
residual boulders.

594
00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:36.886
My truck's parked
right next to one.

595
00:42:49.023 --> 00:42:51.316
Stay on those
residual boulders!

596
00:42:53.277 --> 00:42:57.322
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

597
00:43:03.412 --> 00:43:04.996
Shit!

598
00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:21.722
That's pretty good.

599
00:43:42.243 --> 00:43:45.287
That slimebag ain't gonna give
us much time once we hit that truck.

600
00:43:45.371 --> 00:43:46.580
I say we all
jump together.

601
00:43:46.664 --> 00:43:48.123
Right.

602
00:43:48.207 --> 00:43:49.416
Wait.

603
00:43:51.961 --> 00:43:53.629
Okay, ready.

604
00:43:54.046 --> 00:43:56.882
One, two, three!

605
00:44:04.682 --> 00:44:06.392
Go! Go! Go! Go!

606
00:44:09.728 --> 00:44:11.104
Watch it, Val!

607
00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:16.068
Move! Move!

608
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.249
Could somebody,
perhaps, help me?

609
00:44:31.292 --> 00:44:33.335
- Burt! Heather!
- No! No! No!

610
00:44:33.419 --> 00:44:36.004
The snake things are just
their tongues or something.

611
00:44:36.088 --> 00:44:37.714
These animals are huge!

612
00:44:37.798 --> 00:44:41.718
I'm sorry. I'm having a
real difficult time with this.

613
00:44:41.802 --> 00:44:43.678
Come on,
you guys, answer.

614
00:44:43.762 --> 00:44:45.054
Come back.
- Hey, Walter.

615
00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:46.306
Where's Burt and Heather?

616
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:47.933
I can't reach them.

617
00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:51.102
I guess they're still
driving around somewhere.

618
00:44:51.187 --> 00:44:53.981
Hey, Rhonda, what's the
name you call those things?

619
00:44:54.064 --> 00:44:55.940
Huh? Where do they come from?

620
00:44:56.775 --> 00:44:57.901
I don't know.

621
00:44:57.985 --> 00:44:59.319
You're a scientist,
aren't you?

622
00:44:59.403 --> 00:45:02.531
Yeah, aren't you supposed
to have a theory or something?

623
00:45:02.615 --> 00:45:05.200
Look, these creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

624
00:45:05.284 --> 00:45:07.411
Yeah. But where do
they come from?

625
00:45:07.494 --> 00:45:08.620
Yeah!

626
00:45:10.497 --> 00:45:13.291
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

627
00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:15.585
No name? Ha!

628
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:18.630
We discovered them,
we should name them!

629
00:45:18.714 --> 00:45:21.258
Walter, forget
the damn name!

630
00:45:22.426 --> 00:45:24.845
Now me and Earl think we
better get the hell out of this valley.

631
00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:27.139
Hang on, Val.
Let's not go off half-cocked.

632
00:45:27.223 --> 00:45:29.475
Yeah. Well, somebody's
bound to come check on us,

633
00:45:29.558 --> 00:45:33.019
Once they see the road is
out and the lines are down.

634
00:45:33.103 --> 00:45:34.521
Yeah, that's
how it works.

635
00:45:55.584 --> 00:45:57.961
Or "suckoids." "Oids."

636
00:45:58.045 --> 00:46:00.714
Oids. I like snakeoids.

637
00:46:00.798 --> 00:46:04.593
One of them comes near me, and I'll
just hit him with a five-pound pickax.

638
00:46:04.677 --> 00:46:06.095
No. You don't
understand, Nestor.

639
00:46:06.178 --> 00:46:08.263
They come up from underneath
the ground and they grab you.

640
00:46:08.347 --> 00:46:10.766
They sense the slightest
vibration through the ground.

641
00:46:10.849 --> 00:46:13.726
Even footsteps.
That's how they hunt.

642
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:16.772
Hey, so like we don't
vibrate, right?

643
00:46:18.023 --> 00:46:20.442
Maybe they won't even
come through here.

644
00:46:20.526 --> 00:46:22.611
Maybe they'll
leave us alone!

645
00:46:22.695 --> 00:46:24.863
Chain saw.
That's what I'll use.

646
00:46:24.947 --> 00:46:26.865
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wake up!

647
00:46:27.533 --> 00:46:28.867
Now, look!

648
00:46:34.039 --> 00:46:36.207
You see, they're
headed right for us.

649
00:46:36.292 --> 00:46:37.793
Look, they trapped
Edgar here.

650
00:46:37.876 --> 00:46:39.294
Grabbed old Fred
right here.

651
00:46:39.378 --> 00:46:41.129
Nailed those two poor
suckers on the road,

652
00:46:41.213 --> 00:46:43.548
and the doctor's place
is right here!

653
00:46:43.632 --> 00:46:47.010
Now this valley is just
one long smorgasbord.

654
00:46:47.094 --> 00:46:49.638
We have got to get out.

655
00:46:53.183 --> 00:46:54.684
I'm gonna
go get Mindy.

656
00:46:54.768 --> 00:46:57.854
Oh, she's okay. I saw her
playing down the street.

657
00:46:57.938 --> 00:47:02.150
That's what I like,
"Graboids"! That's it, graboids!

658
00:47:02.234 --> 00:47:03.902
Jesus, Walter.

659
00:47:03.986 --> 00:47:06.780
We're gonna be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

660
00:47:06.864 --> 00:47:08.991
Okay, Val, you say
let's get out of here.

661
00:47:09.074 --> 00:47:11.367
So where are we
supposed to go?

662
00:47:11.452 --> 00:47:14.371
Well, Rhonda's got
an idea about that.

663
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.875
Yeah, see, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

664
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:22.837
The dirt.

665
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:25.131
The loose soil that
covers the valley floor.

666
00:47:25.215 --> 00:47:27.175
But they can't
move through rock.

667
00:47:27.259 --> 00:47:29.177
So I think we should
head west to the mountains.

668
00:47:29.261 --> 00:47:30.845
She means up
the old jeep trail.

669
00:47:30.929 --> 00:47:33.348
If those mountains are solid
granite, we'd be safe there.

670
00:47:33.432 --> 00:47:35.142
And we could hike along them
all the way to Bixby if we...

671
00:47:38.812 --> 00:47:40.605
I scared you, didn't I?

672
00:47:42.107 --> 00:47:43.858
You little ass wipe.

673
00:47:43.942 --> 00:47:47.278
You don't knock it off, you're
gonna be shitting this basketball.

674
00:47:50.157 --> 00:47:51.324
Pardon my French.

675
00:47:54.787 --> 00:47:55.996
Mindy!

676
00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.499
Mindy!

677
00:48:02.044 --> 00:48:04.838
It's gonna take us days
to get back with help with Nestor.

678
00:48:04.922 --> 00:48:07.215
We're not gonna
leave you alone.

679
00:48:11.178 --> 00:48:13.054
Damn it!
I'm gonna kick his ass!

680
00:48:13.138 --> 00:48:14.681
I'm gonna help you.

681
00:48:16.934 --> 00:48:18.143
Melvin!

682
00:48:18.852 --> 00:48:21.145
Where is that
little shit stain?

683
00:48:26.151 --> 00:48:27.902
Melvin, get your...

684
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.158
Get inside!
Get inside!

685
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:48.423
Run! Come on!

686
00:48:48.507 --> 00:48:50.175
Come on, get in!

687
00:48:50.968 --> 00:48:53.971
Jesus Christ, Walter,
you got a gun?

688
00:48:54.054 --> 00:48:56.598
No! What are we gonna do?

689
00:48:56.682 --> 00:48:58.558
Be quiet, quiet, quiet!

690
00:49:00.352 --> 00:49:01.519
Where is he?

691
00:49:21.165 --> 00:49:25.665
Now remember,
no noise, no vibrations.

692
00:49:36.263 --> 00:49:37.973
Oh, no, Mindy.

693
00:49:38.056 --> 00:49:39.223
Stop, stop.

694
00:49:39.308 --> 00:49:41.310
Mindy, get off
the pogo stick.

695
00:49:44.563 --> 00:49:45.730
VALENTINE; Mindy!

696
00:49:45.814 --> 00:49:47.482
- Get her, Val!
- Mindy, come back!

697
00:49:47.566 --> 00:49:48.733
RHONDA; Mindy!

698
00:49:51.904 --> 00:49:52.905
Oh!

699
00:49:58.744 --> 00:49:59.995
Mindy.

700
00:50:00.078 --> 00:50:01.871
Quiet. Quiet.
Don't move.

701
00:50:05.918 --> 00:50:07.920
Mindy, get back.
Get back.

702
00:50:09.296 --> 00:50:11.298
Run!
Get in the house!

703
00:50:20.182 --> 00:50:23.059
We gotta get him off.
It'll suck that truck down.

704
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.438
Go back for Christ's sake!

705
00:50:28.815 --> 00:50:30.983
Jesus, here comes
another one!

706
00:50:32.694 --> 00:50:34.570
Run! Come on! Come on!

707
00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:32.671
Get out of your pants!

708
00:51:39.386 --> 00:51:40.512
Look out!

709
00:51:53.609 --> 00:51:54.693
Run!

710
00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:02.200
Run! Don't look back.
Come on! Come on!

711
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:19.300
Sorry.

712
00:52:41.907 --> 00:52:43.491
Rhonda, here.

713
00:52:43.575 --> 00:52:44.909
Oh, thank you.

714
00:52:45.243 --> 00:52:47.536
So, what are
we gonna do?

715
00:52:47.954 --> 00:52:50.957
You know, how long
till they go away?

716
00:52:51.458 --> 00:52:53.501
They got
the patience of Job.

717
00:52:54.252 --> 00:52:58.339
They sit and goddamn wait till they
hear something that sounds like lunch.

718
00:52:58.423 --> 00:52:59.465
We gotta have a plan.

719
00:52:59.549 --> 00:53:01.092
I got a plan.

720
00:53:01.176 --> 00:53:03.511
You and Val drive the
truck up to the mountain,

721
00:53:03.595 --> 00:53:05.013
walk to Bixby,
get some help.

722
00:53:05.097 --> 00:53:08.642
Walter, those
scumsuckers ate our radials.

723
00:53:08.725 --> 00:53:10.601
Well, you can
take my truck.

724
00:53:10.686 --> 00:53:12.437
No, we need a major
four-wheel drive

725
00:53:12.521 --> 00:53:14.189
just to get up
that jeep trail.

726
00:53:14.272 --> 00:53:16.816
That trail's
all messed up.

727
00:53:20.195 --> 00:53:21.946
Turn it Off.

728
00:53:23.949 --> 00:53:25.909
Pull it back.
Pull it back.

729
00:53:30.622 --> 00:53:32.040
I got it.

730
00:53:43.802 --> 00:53:46.054
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

731
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.816
Son of a bitch.

732
00:54:00.193 --> 00:54:01.777
Son of a bitch!

733
00:54:17.878 --> 00:54:19.963
Come on, let's go!
The roof!

734
00:54:40.567 --> 00:54:41.818
Come on!

735
00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:49.033
Jump, Rho!
You can do it!

736
00:54:49.117 --> 00:54:50.701
No, I can't! I can't!

737
00:54:54.664 --> 00:54:58.042
Rhonda! Don't stop.
Keep moving!

738
00:55:02.756 --> 00:55:04.299
Oh, my God.

739
00:55:04.925 --> 00:55:06.092
Hey!

740
00:55:11.973 --> 00:55:13.224
You Okay?

741
00:55:15.435 --> 00:55:18.604
Hey, what's going
on? Where are you guys?

742
00:55:19.314 --> 00:55:21.482
What's up, man? What the
hell are you doing up there?

743
00:55:21.566 --> 00:55:24.610
Melvin, shut
the hell up.

744
00:55:24.694 --> 00:55:26.570
Get up on your roof.
- No way!

745
00:55:44.756 --> 00:55:45.923
Nestor?

746
00:55:46.716 --> 00:55:47.925
Nestor?

747
00:55:49.177 --> 00:55:51.762
Nancy, get up
on your roofs.

748
00:55:51.847 --> 00:55:54.975
Up on your roofs! They
come through the floor!

749
00:56:07.153 --> 00:56:09.613
I don't know.
I can't believe it.

750
00:56:10.615 --> 00:56:11.907
No tracks.

751
00:56:12.742 --> 00:56:14.618
No sign. No spoor.

752
00:56:15.996 --> 00:56:17.163
You'd think after
eating all those sheep

753
00:56:17.247 --> 00:56:19.832
they'd have to
take a dump some place.

754
00:56:19.916 --> 00:56:22.084
Yeah. I don't
understand it.

755
00:56:42.647 --> 00:56:45.358
<i>Yo, Walter.
This is Burt. Come back.</i>

756
00:56:48.028 --> 00:56:50.155
<i>Walter? Anybody copy?</i>

757
00:56:52.324 --> 00:56:53.783
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

758
00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:56.119
<i>Walter, you there?
Come back!</i>

759
00:56:56.202 --> 00:56:57.703
Okay, I got it.

760
00:57:06.963 --> 00:57:09.715
<i>Yo, who's minding the store,
for God's sake?</i>

761
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:13.677
Burt, listen. We found out
what's been killing people.

762
00:57:13.762 --> 00:57:15.722
Say "over."
- Over.

763
00:57:15.805 --> 00:57:19.141
Negative copy on that,
Walter. Check your frequency.

764
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.770
I'm on 22. Come back.

765
00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.356
<i>Burt, can you
hear me now? Over.</i>

766
00:57:26.107 --> 00:57:28.234
Val, is that you? What're
you doing back already?

767
00:57:28.318 --> 00:57:30.570
Hey, Burt, something real
weird is going on over there.

768
00:57:30.654 --> 00:57:32.447
They're up on
top of the roof.

769
00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:51.048
Hey, I think they're
going for Burt's.

770
00:57:54.844 --> 00:57:57.054
Oh, man,
they're going!

771
00:57:57.722 --> 00:58:01.100
Burt, get out of your
basement. Take your radio.

772
00:58:01.184 --> 00:58:03.019
You and Heather
get up on your roof.

773
00:58:03.103 --> 00:58:04.813
We'll talk later.
Okay? Over.

774
00:58:04.896 --> 00:58:07.148
Up on the roof? Val,
what are you talking about?

775
00:58:07.232 --> 00:58:10.443
Damn it, Burt. Just listen
to him. Something's wrong.

776
00:58:10.902 --> 00:58:12.528
<i>Burt, Jesus Christ!</i>

777
00:58:12.612 --> 00:58:14.822
Get up on your roof!
The things!

778
00:58:14.906 --> 00:58:16.365
<i>They're under the ground.</i>

779
00:58:16.449 --> 00:58:17.992
<i>They're bigger than we
thought. They're huge.</i>

780
00:58:18.076 --> 00:58:21.037
<i>They're coming right after you
guys. They're coming right now!</i>

781
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.306
We don't see
anything, Val.

782
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.016
What the hell are you
talking about? Over.

783
00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.603
Burt, they're under the ground.
They're under the ground.

784
00:58:45.687 --> 00:58:47.146
<i>They can dig like
a son of a bitch.</i>

785
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.398
<i>Big monsters!
Underground! Now get out!</i>

786
00:58:49.482 --> 00:58:50.733
<i>Hurry!</i>

787
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:13.214
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

788
00:59:53.338 --> 00:59:54.839
Burt, come on.

789
01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:05.934
Magazine!
- Here!

790
01:00:28.331 --> 01:00:29.457
Here!

791
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:19.674
Broke into the wrong goddamn
rec room didn't you, you bastard?

792
01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:25.638
<i>We killed it! You got that? We killed
that motherhumper! Come back.</i>

793
01:01:27.265 --> 01:01:30.351
Well, roger that, Burt.
And congratulations.

794
01:01:30.435 --> 01:01:32.478
Be advised, however,
there are two more.

795
01:01:32.562 --> 01:01:34.564
Repeat, two more
motherhumpers.

796
01:01:47.285 --> 01:01:49.287
Burt got one!
He killed one!

797
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.455
Way to go, dude!

798
01:01:51.539 --> 01:01:52.873
All right!

799
01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:57.336
Yes! Yes!

800
01:01:58.171 --> 01:02:01.841
Well, I guess we don't get to make
fun of Burt's lifestyle anymore, huh?

801
01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:03.051
Say, Burt?

802
01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:05.719
<i>Any chance you can get
the other two? Come back.</i>

803
01:02:05.803 --> 01:02:08.055
Yeah. One second, pal.

804
01:02:17.357 --> 01:02:20.276
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

805
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.486
Shit!

806
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.696
Good Lord!

807
01:02:29.661 --> 01:02:31.537
Val, we can't get them.

808
01:02:32.538 --> 01:02:34.706
<i>I never figured on having
to shoot through dirt.</i>

809
01:02:34.791 --> 01:02:37.668
<i>The best goddamn bullet
stop there is. Come back.</i>

810
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.879
Let me see that.

811
01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.757
Burt, listen.
Forget shooting them.

812
01:02:43.841 --> 01:02:45.759
Tell me this. Can
you get to your truck?

813
01:02:45.843 --> 01:02:47.094
<i>Over.</i>
- No problem.

814
01:02:47.178 --> 01:02:48.637
<i>Good, 'cause you have the
only truck in the valley</i>

815
01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:50.097
<i>that can get up
that jeep trail.</i>

816
01:02:50.181 --> 01:02:52.141
Now listen.
Here's the plan.

817
01:02:52.225 --> 01:02:54.101
You and Heather
go for help.

818
01:02:54.185 --> 01:02:55.436
You get to the mountains
and keep going...

819
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.980
Guys! You guys!

820
01:02:58.064 --> 01:02:59.815
Come over.
- Hang on a sec.

821
01:03:01.567 --> 01:03:02.693
He's up to something.

822
01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:05.321
Well, if it
isn't our old pal, stumpy.

823
01:03:05.405 --> 01:03:06.572
Bastard.

824
01:03:14.205 --> 01:03:17.958
Hey, Rhonda. What do you
think it's trying to do now?

825
01:03:18.042 --> 01:03:20.127
Why do you keep asking me?

826
01:03:31.597 --> 01:03:32.639
What the...

827
01:03:32.724 --> 01:03:33.766
What the...

828
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:43.401
Gee! Wow.

829
01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.905
What the hell was that?

830
01:03:47.989 --> 01:03:51.826
<i>Breaker there, Earl. What
did you want us to do? Come back.</i>

831
01:03:53.036 --> 01:03:56.205
Hang on, Burt. This
bastard's trying something new.

832
01:03:57.665 --> 01:03:58.791
Over.

833
01:04:14.766 --> 01:04:17.185
They wasn't
making no noise.

834
01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:19.144
Why is he
bothering them for?

835
01:04:19.228 --> 01:04:22.522
Well, it's like it's studying the
buildings, trying to figure them out.

836
01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:25.693
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

837
01:04:25.777 --> 01:04:28.571
Looks to me like they're
coming up with a plan.

838
01:04:35.328 --> 01:04:36.954
Watch it, Nestor!

839
01:04:43.044 --> 01:04:44.170
Jesus!

840
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:50.968
Shit! Enough!

841
01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:00.269
Get off the
ground, Nestor! Get moving!

842
01:05:00.353 --> 01:05:02.355
Get out of there!
Get off the ground!

843
01:05:02.438 --> 01:05:04.106
Move it! Move it!

844
01:05:05.817 --> 01:05:07.401
No, Nestor.
That's no good.

845
01:05:07.485 --> 01:05:09.153
Come on,
you gotta get higher.

846
01:05:20.498 --> 01:05:22.374
No way! No way, man!

847
01:05:23.459 --> 01:05:26.003
No! You guys
gotta do something!

848
01:05:27.505 --> 01:05:29.507
You gotta do something!

849
01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:35.429
<i>Burt, Heather?</i>

850
01:05:38.808 --> 01:05:40.976
Yeah, you got us, Val.
Come on back. Over.

851
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.270
<i>Listen, we're in
deep shit over here.</i>

852
01:05:43.354 --> 01:05:45.105
<i>We'll have to
change that plan.</i>

853
01:05:47.817 --> 01:05:48.984
Burt, cut it out!

854
01:05:49.068 --> 01:05:50.569
I think I scared him.

855
01:05:50.653 --> 01:05:52.363
<i>No use going for help.</i>

856
01:05:52.864 --> 01:05:55.449
<i>We'd be dead long before
you'd ever get back.</i>

857
01:05:56.117 --> 01:05:59.328
Okay, Val, we're with you. Just
tell us what you wanna do. Over.

858
01:05:59.412 --> 01:06:02.790
Yeah, well, this one's gonna
tear this town out from under us.

859
01:06:02.874 --> 01:06:05.459
We're all gonna have to
get out of here together, now.

860
01:06:05.543 --> 01:06:06.669
Okay, Val.

861
01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:09.880
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

862
01:06:10.756 --> 01:06:11.882
Look.

863
01:06:35.323 --> 01:06:37.950
<i>Val, you're gonna have to
forget about the truck.</i>

864
01:06:38.034 --> 01:06:39.744
Yeah, we got you, Heather.

865
01:06:41.787 --> 01:06:45.081
Now, look. The
situation hasn't changed.

866
01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:48.460
We still have to make it to solid
rock. There's gotta be some way.

867
01:06:48.544 --> 01:06:49.586
Like what?

868
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:52.255
There's nothing left that can
make it to those mountains.

869
01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:56.468
Hey, Val. Quiet, man.

870
01:06:57.595 --> 01:07:00.014
It doesn't matter now.
They know we're here.

871
01:07:00.097 --> 01:07:02.766
Oh, shit! We need a
helicopter is what we need.

872
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.351
Or a goddamn tank!

873
01:07:04.435 --> 01:07:05.936
Wait a minute.

874
01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.313
Wait a minute.
The Cat!

875
01:07:08.397 --> 01:07:09.689
Could we take the Cat?

876
01:07:09.774 --> 01:07:12.151
Oh, Jesus.
It's slower than hell.

877
01:07:12.235 --> 01:07:13.569
Yeah, but it weighs
better than 30 tons.

878
01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:15.529
There's no way they
could lift 30 tons.

879
01:07:15.613 --> 01:07:16.697
Could they? I mean...

880
01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:19.575
But we can't all
fit on the bulldozer.

881
01:07:22.286 --> 01:07:23.412
No.

882
01:07:23.955 --> 01:07:27.208
No, but we could
drag something, though.

883
01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:30.294
We could pull a car
behind it. I don't know.

884
01:07:31.128 --> 01:07:33.463
Hell, that old semitrailer.

885
01:07:34.173 --> 01:07:36.216
Its tires are flat.
Doesn't matter.

886
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:38.051
That Cat can
pull anything.

887
01:07:38.135 --> 01:07:39.761
Well, all right.

888
01:07:40.096 --> 01:07:41.806
We just roll on
out of here.

889
01:07:41.889 --> 01:07:43.515
We've got a plan!

890
01:07:48.437 --> 01:07:51.565
Of course, that's a
hell of a long walk.

891
01:07:51.649 --> 01:07:55.027
Listen, they only respond
to vibration, right?

892
01:07:55.111 --> 01:07:57.738
Well, couldn't we
distract them somehow?

893
01:07:58.447 --> 01:08:00.073
Yeah. Good.

894
01:08:00.157 --> 01:08:02.826
Something to keep
them busy, like a decoy.

895
01:08:04.495 --> 01:08:06.872
Hey, Melvin,
you wanna make a buck?

896
01:08:07.248 --> 01:08:08.249
Eat it!

897
01:08:08.332 --> 01:08:09.750
How about the tractor?

898
01:08:09.834 --> 01:08:12.586
Walter's little tractor?
Start him up.

899
01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:14.380
Let him go out
by himself.

900
01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:18.008
Let those things follow him
all over if they like that noise.

901
01:08:18.593 --> 01:08:20.553
Not bad.
What do you think?

902
01:08:33.983 --> 01:08:35.567
Ground's getting closer, Earl.
- Yeah.

903
01:08:35.651 --> 01:08:37.569
I say we go with
Miguel's plan.

904
01:09:05.222 --> 01:09:06.514
Just hold on, Nancy!

905
01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:07.766
I'm making the run
for the Cat.

906
01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:08.892
Like hell you are.

907
01:09:08.976 --> 01:09:10.352
Get real, Earl.
I'm faster than you.

908
01:09:10.436 --> 01:09:11.645
But I'm best at
driving the Cat.

909
01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:12.813
Not while I'm around.

910
01:09:12.897 --> 01:09:14.148
Look, damn it!
Now listen to me.

911
01:09:14.231 --> 01:09:15.440
I'm older
and I'm wiser.

912
01:09:15.524 --> 01:09:17.609
Yeah? Well,
you're half right.

913
01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:24.658
Damn! I lost.
Guess I'll have to do it.

914
01:09:24.742 --> 01:09:26.702
I won.
I pick who does it.

915
01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:29.497
Ready when
you are, Miguel.

916
01:09:44.512 --> 01:09:47.139
There he is.
There he goes!

917
01:09:47.223 --> 01:09:49.892
He's chasing it.
He's chasing it.

918
01:09:53.771 --> 01:09:57.024
It's going.
This one's going, too!

919
01:09:58.776 --> 01:09:59.902
Good luck, shithead.

920
01:09:59.985 --> 01:10:01.945
Don't worry about me,
jerk-off.

921
01:10:09.286 --> 01:10:10.370
Shit!

922
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:15.667
You suicidal
son of a bitch.

923
01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:32.976
Keep going!

924
01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:43.153
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

925
01:10:46.449 --> 01:10:47.741
Come on!

926
01:10:49.368 --> 01:10:50.952
They're gonna get him!

927
01:10:52.955 --> 01:10:55.832
Val, stop! They're
coming! Be quiet!

928
01:10:55.916 --> 01:10:57.167
Don't move!

929
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.639
It worked.
They can't find him.

930
01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:19.981
We gotta...

931
01:11:21.025 --> 01:11:22.943
We gotta make some noise.

932
01:11:23.027 --> 01:11:24.445
A lot of noise!

933
01:11:25.404 --> 01:11:28.740
Hey, you sorry sons of
bitches! Come and get my ass!

934
01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:32.786
Over here, you slime bucket!
Come get me!

935
01:11:42.046 --> 01:11:45.591
Come on. What
are you, scared? Come on.

936
01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.438
Hey, what's she doing?

937
01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:15.579
That did it, girl!
God damn good thinking.

938
01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:43.792
You okay?
- Yeah.

939
01:13:49.006 --> 01:13:50.382
Here goes.

940
01:14:00.976 --> 01:14:02.310
Here.
- Yeah.

941
01:14:21.705 --> 01:14:23.081
God damn!

942
01:14:23.624 --> 01:14:25.167
Armored transport.

943
01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:26.960
Burt! Heather!

944
01:14:27.044 --> 01:14:28.420
Let's get going!
Let's move it.

945
01:14:28.504 --> 01:14:30.339
Burt! Heather!

946
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.426
Come on, let's go, you two.
We're headed for the mountains.

947
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:37.137
If that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

948
01:14:37.221 --> 01:14:40.641
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

949
01:14:40.724 --> 01:14:42.058
They're getting
smarter by the minute.

950
01:14:42.142 --> 01:14:43.309
That's fine.

951
01:14:43.394 --> 01:14:45.020
We've got some new
things to teach them.

952
01:14:59.493 --> 01:15:01.077
You see that?

953
01:15:01.161 --> 01:15:03.997
They're doing it again.
They try it every time I stop!

954
01:15:04.081 --> 01:15:05.582
Come on, now.

955
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:09.169
Jesus Christ! We're
only going nine miles.

956
01:15:09.253 --> 01:15:12.714
Yeah, well, those things are gonna be
on our ass every foot of the way, right?

957
01:15:12.798 --> 01:15:16.176
Just hurry! Burt, Heather,
what are you doing up there?

958
01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.302
Can't you see
we're sinking?

959
01:15:17.386 --> 01:15:18.595
Get in the trailer!

960
01:15:18.679 --> 01:15:21.264
What do you think?
Max firepower or this?

961
01:15:21.348 --> 01:15:22.515
I go for penetration.

962
01:15:22.599 --> 01:15:26.019
The .458, shooting solids.
Less ammo to carry.

963
01:15:26.103 --> 01:15:27.771
Come on, Burt.
Move it!

964
01:15:28.731 --> 01:15:30.816
Watch these ammo boxes!

965
01:15:30.899 --> 01:15:31.941
Come on, Burt!

966
01:15:32.026 --> 01:15:33.610
Heather, hurry!

967
01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:35.028
Tell them to come on!

968
01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:36.363
Okay, now!

969
01:15:36.447 --> 01:15:38.740
Now! Come on! Come on!

970
01:15:44.329 --> 01:15:45.955
Hey, give me a gun.
I'll take one.

971
01:15:46.081 --> 01:15:48.792
I wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War Ill.

972
01:16:07.853 --> 01:16:10.480
Food for five years.

973
01:16:11.482 --> 01:16:13.567
A thousand gallons of gas,
air filtration,

974
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.735
water filtration,
Geiger counter,

975
01:16:15.819 --> 01:16:17.362
bomb shelter.

976
01:16:20.407 --> 01:16:23.493
Underground
goddamn monsters!

977
01:16:35.672 --> 01:16:39.175
Yo, there we go!
Solid rock.

978
01:16:46.892 --> 01:16:48.560
Any sign of them?

979
01:16:49.686 --> 01:16:52.021
Maybe they just
gave up, you know?

980
01:16:55.192 --> 01:16:56.818
Hey, what's that?

981
01:16:58.612 --> 01:17:01.197
Damn it! What the hell
are they doing?

982
01:17:01.281 --> 01:17:02.949
I don't care
what they're doing

983
01:17:03.033 --> 01:17:05.660
As long as they're
doing it way over there.

984
01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:14.252
Wait, wait!
Look out!

985
01:17:19.466 --> 01:17:20.508
Mindy!

986
01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:22.552
Mommy!
- Everybody stay here.

987
01:17:22.636 --> 01:17:24.429
Burt, you okay?
- I'm okay.

988
01:17:24.513 --> 01:17:26.932
Are they gonna
get us? What happened?

989
01:17:28.725 --> 01:17:30.143
Burt, you sure
you're okay?

990
01:17:30.227 --> 01:17:31.561
Yeah.

991
01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:32.937
Earl,
what happened?

992
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:34.814
What happened?

993
01:17:35.524 --> 01:17:37.150
They dug a trap.

994
01:17:37.526 --> 01:17:39.069
I can't believe this.

995
01:17:40.946 --> 01:17:42.405
All right.

996
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.366
Here.

997
01:17:57.671 --> 01:17:59.339
Let me have my gun.

998
01:18:03.802 --> 01:18:06.179
Hungry? Eat this!

999
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:08.556
Everybody down!

1000
01:18:18.066 --> 01:18:19.650
There they are!

1001
01:18:19.735 --> 01:18:20.736
Did you get one?

1002
01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:21.945
I don't know.

1003
01:18:22.029 --> 01:18:23.071
No, there's still
two of them.

1004
01:18:23.155 --> 01:18:25.240
Look, there're two
different dust trails.

1005
01:18:25.324 --> 01:18:27.159
Sure made them
think twice though.

1006
01:18:27.242 --> 01:18:28.576
What the hell's in
those things, Burt?

1007
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.329
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

1008
01:18:36.501 --> 01:18:39.003
Here they come.
They're coming back!

1009
01:18:46.345 --> 01:18:48.638
We'll have to make
a run for those rocks.

1010
01:18:48.722 --> 01:18:50.557
I don't know, Val. That's
a hell of a long way.

1011
01:18:50.641 --> 01:18:51.850
Yeah, man,
they'll get us!

1012
01:18:51.934 --> 01:18:54.394
They're sure as hell
gonna get us if we stay here.

1013
01:18:54.478 --> 01:18:56.688
Hey, Burt! You have
any more of those bombs?

1014
01:18:56.772 --> 01:18:58.106
We've got you
covered, Rhonda.

1015
01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.401
Well, what if we throw one that
way, the way that we wanna go?

1016
01:19:01.485 --> 01:19:03.987
Then when it explodes, I
mean, if it drives them away,

1017
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:06.323
we run like
goddamn bastards.

1018
01:19:07.115 --> 01:19:08.366
Pardon my French.

1019
01:19:09.743 --> 01:19:13.455
What if they don't get
scared? What if they don't run?

1020
01:19:13.538 --> 01:19:15.873
I don't think it does
scare them. It hurts them.

1021
01:19:15.958 --> 01:19:18.168
They're so sensitive
to sound, they gotta run.

1022
01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:20.003
Oh, hell,
she's got my vote!

1023
01:19:20.087 --> 01:19:22.672
That's it! We're
making a run for it!

1024
01:19:22.756 --> 01:19:24.215
We're going
for the rocks.

1025
01:19:24.299 --> 01:19:26.092
I don't know, man.
They're too fast.

1026
01:19:26.176 --> 01:19:27.343
You can't outrun them.
No way!

1027
01:19:27.427 --> 01:19:30.638
Yo, Melvin. This'll
make them think twice.

1028
01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:32.890
Everybody ready to run?

1029
01:19:39.773 --> 01:19:41.191
Heads down!

1030
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:52.035
It worked!
There they go!

1031
01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:53.745
All right, let's go!

1032
01:19:53.829 --> 01:19:54.955
Move.

1033
01:19:55.038 --> 01:19:56.289
There you go.

1034
01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:00.335
Here. Come on, Burt.

1035
01:20:03.505 --> 01:20:04.756
Oh, fuck.

1036
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:07.258
Oh, Burt, you asshole!

1037
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:13.014
Mommy!

1038
01:20:13.098 --> 01:20:14.891
Mindy, get up.
Get up.

1039
01:20:23.025 --> 01:20:24.151
Get up here!

1040
01:20:24.234 --> 01:20:25.401
I'm with you, honey.

1041
01:20:26.153 --> 01:20:27.654
Go, go, go!

1042
01:20:34.578 --> 01:20:37.706
Burt, you asshole! There's
no bullets in this gun.

1043
01:20:38.415 --> 01:20:40.417
Got you moving,
didn't it?

1044
01:21:09.821 --> 01:21:11.322
So, now what?

1045
01:21:12.282 --> 01:21:15.660
Could we make it to the
mountains, use Burt's explosives?

1046
01:21:15.744 --> 01:21:16.953
No way.

1047
01:21:17.704 --> 01:21:19.789
We'd need 50
of those bombs.

1048
01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:21.291
Well, that's it.

1049
01:21:22.376 --> 01:21:24.044
We're not getting
off this rock.

1050
01:21:24.127 --> 01:21:28.172
Well, we're not gonna
pole vault out of here.

1051
01:21:28.256 --> 01:21:29.840
That's for damn sure.

1052
01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:32.052
Wait a minute.

1053
01:21:32.636 --> 01:21:34.429
What're y'all
talking about?

1054
01:21:34.513 --> 01:21:36.473
It's like you're
giving up or something.

1055
01:21:36.556 --> 01:21:40.768
They'll just wait out there till we're
dead. That's exactly what they do.

1056
01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:42.061
Wait!

1057
01:21:42.145 --> 01:21:43.312
Wait!

1058
01:21:44.022 --> 01:21:46.566
For Christ sake, we could've
made a stand at our place.

1059
01:21:46.650 --> 01:21:49.152
We had food, water.

1060
01:21:49.236 --> 01:21:50.737
You can't fight
them like that.

1061
01:21:50.821 --> 01:21:54.032
So you two screw-ups
hauled us way the hell out here?

1062
01:21:57.828 --> 01:22:01.081
Hey, why don't you just
back off, string bean?

1063
01:22:01.164 --> 01:22:03.166
You know, we could've left
your worthless ass on the roof!

1064
01:22:03.250 --> 01:22:04.876
I wish you had,
fearless leader.

1065
01:22:05.001 --> 01:22:07.044
Who the hell put you two in charge?
- Don't push me!

1066
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:09.547
- Just back off, Burt.
- Just don't goddamn push me!

1067
01:22:12.342 --> 01:22:14.594
If them graboids
don't kill him, I will.

1068
01:22:14.678 --> 01:22:15.845
What?

1069
01:22:16.555 --> 01:22:19.182
They'd have torn your place
out from under you in half an hour.

1070
01:22:19.266 --> 01:22:20.308
Come on. Come on.

1071
01:22:20.392 --> 01:22:22.769
Just let it go. Let it
go. Forget about it.

1072
01:22:24.146 --> 01:22:26.481
I know he does. He
thinks he knows everything.

1073
01:22:38.368 --> 01:22:42.205
If it comes to starvation,
I know what I'm doing.

1074
01:22:43.748 --> 01:22:45.291
Take one of these,

1075
01:22:46.042 --> 01:22:50.046
walk right out there with the
fuse lit and let them take me down.

1076
01:22:51.715 --> 01:22:52.882
Boom.

1077
01:22:56.678 --> 01:22:58.304
Good Lord, honey.

1078
01:23:00.098 --> 01:23:02.058
Now that's not
a bad idea.

1079
01:23:03.393 --> 01:23:05.603
No, no.
It gives me an idea.

1080
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:07.271
Going fishing like.

1081
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.779
There's one.
Straight out in front.

1082
01:23:14.863 --> 01:23:17.198
Let's see if we can
keep him right there.

1083
01:23:17.282 --> 01:23:18.658
All right,
how much we need?

1084
01:23:18.742 --> 01:23:20.326
I don't know.
They're pretty quick.

1085
01:23:20.410 --> 01:23:22.245
Fifteen seconds
at least.

1086
01:23:24.289 --> 01:23:25.665
Which kind of fuse
is that?

1087
01:23:25.749 --> 01:23:27.083
Cannon fuse.

1088
01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:28.751
What the hell
you use if for?

1089
01:23:28.835 --> 01:23:30.378
My cannon.

1090
01:23:30.462 --> 01:23:32.172
You guys
watch yourselves.

1091
01:23:35.759 --> 01:23:38.011
Right out there
about 30...

1092
01:23:38.094 --> 01:23:40.471
Oh, man. You're not
gonna do your lasso thing?

1093
01:23:40.555 --> 01:23:43.057
Just 'cause you're
no good with a rope.

1094
01:23:47.145 --> 01:23:48.688
All right, get back!

1095
01:23:58.615 --> 01:24:00.116
Come on, baby.

1096
01:24:01.409 --> 01:24:03.411
Take it.
Take the bait!

1097
01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.792
Yeah! All right!

1098
01:24:14.589 --> 01:24:16.090
Look at it!

1099
01:24:16.174 --> 01:24:17.258
Yeah!

1100
01:24:23.557 --> 01:24:24.808
All right!

1101
01:24:35.819 --> 01:24:37.654
Okay, one to go.

1102
01:24:39.072 --> 01:24:41.157
Damn! Where
the hell is he?

1103
01:24:42.367 --> 01:24:43.993
Hope he didn't wise up.

1104
01:24:46.955 --> 01:24:48.164
There.

1105
01:24:50.125 --> 01:24:51.835
Look who it is.

1106
01:24:51.918 --> 01:24:53.336
Give me that thing.

1107
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.838
This son of a bitch is mine.

1108
01:24:59.384 --> 01:25:01.052
There it goes!

1109
01:25:01.136 --> 01:25:02.137
All right, get back!

1110
01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.262
I got it.

1111
01:25:03.346 --> 01:25:04.930
Come on. Come on.

1112
01:25:17.527 --> 01:25:19.862
Come on,
lunchtime, snot head.

1113
01:25:22.574 --> 01:25:24.158
All right, get down!

1114
01:25:26.995 --> 01:25:28.162
Shit!

1115
01:25:31.708 --> 01:25:33.209
Oh, my God! It's...

1116
01:25:33.293 --> 01:25:34.502
Get back! Get back!

1117
01:25:34.586 --> 01:25:35.670
Run!

1118
01:25:37.047 --> 01:25:38.548
Get up, come on!

1119
01:25:53.897 --> 01:25:56.065
What are you doing
out there?

1120
01:26:11.247 --> 01:26:12.665
Okay, let's make
some noise.

1121
01:26:12.749 --> 01:26:14.709
Try to distract him.
Come on, everybody.

1122
01:26:30.517 --> 01:26:31.809
Fresh meat!

1123
01:26:45.657 --> 01:26:47.241
Wait, wait, wait.

1124
01:26:49.828 --> 01:26:52.080
This one's not
falling for it.

1125
01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:55.708
This one ain't dumb.

1126
01:26:56.835 --> 01:26:58.753
He's trying to trick us.

1127
01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.798
Use your bomb.

1128
01:27:02.882 --> 01:27:04.967
It's our last one.

1129
01:27:06.344 --> 01:27:08.679
What else you
gonna use it for?

1130
01:27:09.514 --> 01:27:11.766
So what if we
make it to the rocks?

1131
01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:14.060
We'll be dead in
three days anyway.

1132
01:27:14.144 --> 01:27:16.437
Well, I wanna live
for the three days.

1133
01:27:16.521 --> 01:27:18.439
What the hell?
What's the matter?

1134
01:27:18.523 --> 01:27:20.191
Use the bomb,
for God sakes!

1135
01:27:20.275 --> 01:27:21.859
Throw
that bomb, man!

1136
01:27:21.943 --> 01:27:23.486
Scare him away!

1137
01:27:24.779 --> 01:27:26.489
Throw the bomb!

1138
01:27:30.326 --> 01:27:32.661
This bastard ain't
smarter than us.

1139
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:35.706
For Christ's sake, Val!

1140
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:37.249
I'm gonna go for it.

1141
01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:38.751
Go for what?

1142
01:27:50.054 --> 01:27:51.263
What are you doing?

1143
01:27:51.347 --> 01:27:53.682
I got a goddamn plan!

1144
01:27:56.853 --> 01:27:58.354
Where the hell is it?

1145
01:28:02.358 --> 01:28:03.859
I've got it!

1146
01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:11.825
This better be
one hell of a great plan!

1147
01:28:19.375 --> 01:28:20.542
Get ready!

1148
01:28:21.711 --> 01:28:22.878
Light it, man! Light it!

1149
01:28:22.962 --> 01:28:24.088
Not yet. Not yet!

1150
01:28:24.172 --> 01:28:26.257
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

1151
01:28:27.133 --> 01:28:28.300
Go!

1152
01:28:29.552 --> 01:28:32.012
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1153
01:28:33.264 --> 01:28:35.391
Too far!
You threw it behind him.

1154
01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.191
Run, Val! Run!

1155
01:28:48.905 --> 01:28:50.239
Yeah!

1156
01:28:52.116 --> 01:28:55.410
Can you fly, you sucker?
Can you fly?

1157
01:29:23.147 --> 01:29:27.067
Well, it just suddenly
hit me, you know.

1158
01:29:28.027 --> 01:29:29.319
Stampede.

1159
01:29:35.952 --> 01:29:37.787
Way to go!

1160
01:29:37.871 --> 01:29:39.622
Way to go, Val!

1161
01:29:46.379 --> 01:29:50.879
Now, the second we hit Bixby,
we start making some phone calls.

1162
01:29:51.426 --> 01:29:53.886
I mean, we could make
some real money on this thing.

1163
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:56.514
We could get in
<i>People</i> magazine.

1164
01:29:56.598 --> 01:29:59.767
<i>People?</i> Hell!
<i>National Geographic.</i>

1165
01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:02.311
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1166
01:30:04.689 --> 01:30:05.898
Smile.

1167
01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.662
Burt loaned me
his camera.

1168
01:30:19.746 --> 01:30:22.165
Yeah. He gave us
these tires, too.

1169
01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:29.255
It's all pretty
exciting, huh?

1170
01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:33.968
There's gonna be major
research, and I'm gonna be in on it.

1171
01:30:34.802 --> 01:30:38.514
The first thing to do is take some
pictures of that one we dug up.

1172
01:30:39.182 --> 01:30:41.017
Yeah. Yeah.

1173
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.519
Pictures seem
like a good idea.

1174
01:30:46.022 --> 01:30:47.440
Yeah, well,
thanks for everything,

1175
01:30:47.523 --> 01:30:49.650
you know,
saving my life and stuff.

1176
01:30:52.654 --> 01:30:54.072
You're welcome.

1177
01:30:56.449 --> 01:30:58.075
Maybe I'll see you sometime?

1178
01:30:58.159 --> 01:30:59.368
Uh-huh.

1179
01:31:09.128 --> 01:31:11.755
Well, see you.

1180
01:31:18.554 --> 01:31:21.306
I know. I know!
I'm working up to it.

1181
01:31:22.475 --> 01:31:23.893
What am I doing?

1182
01:31:23.977 --> 01:31:27.063
I mean, what's a woman like
her want with a guy like me?

1183
01:31:27.146 --> 01:31:29.398
She's going
for her damn Ph.D.

1184
01:31:32.235 --> 01:31:33.486
Rhonda?

1185
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.487
Yeah?

1186
01:31:35.571 --> 01:31:38.282
Well, I just
wanted to...
