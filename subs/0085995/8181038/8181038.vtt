1
00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:38.944
Clark Griswold.
I'm trading my wife's old car in.

2
00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.115
Say goodbye
to the old gas-guzzler, Russ.

3
00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:44.825
See you later.

4
00:02:44.992 --> 00:02:46.535
Pretty exciting, isn't it, Rusty?

5
00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:49.580
- What's that, Dad?
- Picking up the new car.

6
00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:52.541
Yeah, you can't wait, can you?

7
00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.960
- Hi there, Ed.
- Good to see you, Mr. Griswold.

8
00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:57.421
- How're you doing? Ruben, right?
- Rusty.

9
00:02:57.588 --> 00:02:59.464
- Okay.
- Look at him. He can't wait.

10
00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:01.341
So did you bring your trade-in?

11
00:03:01.508 --> 00:03:04.261
Yeah, a guy just took it away
a couple of seconds ago.

12
00:03:04.428 --> 00:03:05.846
- Let's get to it, then.
- Okay.

13
00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.724
We were afraid the new one
wouldn't come in yet.

14
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.352
On our way to California. The big vacation,
the whole family, Walley World.

15
00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.813
- Walley World? Very exciting, Clyde.
- Clark.

16
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.441
Well, there she is.

17
00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:18.650
Where?

18
00:03:18.817 --> 00:03:20.569
Right here. The wagon.

19
00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:23.280
Dad, this is not the car you ordered.

20
00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:27.534
Take it easy, Rusty.
Ed, this is not the car I ordered.

21
00:03:28.535 --> 00:03:31.830
I distinctly ordered
the Antarctic Blue Super Sportswagon...

22
00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.499
...with the CB
and the optional Rally fun pack.

23
00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:37.461
You didn't order the Metallic Pea?

24
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.340
Metallic Pea? No, Antarctic Blue.

25
00:03:41.506 --> 00:03:44.843
The Sportswagon.
This isn't even the right model.

26
00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:47.512
I think you're right.
I don't think this is the car.

27
00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.681
This is the new
Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

28
00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:53.352
This is a damn fine automobile,
if you want my honest opinion.

29
00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.354
Beats the hell
out of the Sportswagon.

30
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.189
But I want to make you happy.

31
00:03:57.356 --> 00:03:58.565
Davenport.

32
00:03:58.732 --> 00:04:00.484
I'll get to the bottom of this.

33
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:01.944
Yes, Mr. Ed?

34
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.113
Mr. Griswold ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?

35
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.157
I don't know, sir.

36
00:04:09.743 --> 00:04:12.245
I know what must have happened.

37
00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:13.997
It didn't come in.

38
00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:19.711
Ed, I'm not your ordinary,
everyday fool. Okay?

39
00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:23.131
Now, I'd like my Antarctic Blue
Super Sportswagon right now.

40
00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:26.885
If you can't get it for me,
I'm gonna take my business elsewhere.

41
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.303
Where's my old car?

42
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.935
I'm just as upset as you are. Believe me.

43
00:04:35.102 --> 00:04:36.728
Davenport.

44
00:04:36.895 --> 00:04:40.315
Get Mr. Griswold's car back.
Bring it back here.

45
00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:49.950
I can get you the wagon, no problem.
The problem is, it might take six weeks.

46
00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.911
I owe it to myself
to tell you, Mr. Griswold...

47
00:04:53.078 --> 00:04:55.747
...if you're thinking of taking
the tribe cross-country...

48
00:04:55.914 --> 00:04:58.041
...this is the automobile
you should be using.

49
00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:00.210
The Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

50
00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:03.046
You think you hate it now,
but wait until you drive it.

51
00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:06.633
I don't want to drive it.
I just want my old car back, okay?

52
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.929
I'm not falling for this bit.
No way. Let's go, Russ.

53
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:45.422
Clark, is that the right car?

54
00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.633
No, it isn't, honey. I changed my mind.

55
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.595
They flattened our old car like a pancake.

56
00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:55.015
Are you serious?
Is this really our car, Dad?

57
00:05:55.182 --> 00:05:58.268
What happened? I thought we were
gonna get the little Sports thing.

58
00:05:58.435 --> 00:06:01.021
Oh, no. The Sportswagon's
much too small.

59
00:06:01.188 --> 00:06:03.315
Besides, I got a great deal on this one.

60
00:06:03.482 --> 00:06:07.110
Let me tell you, if we're taking
the whole tribe across country...

61
00:06:07.277 --> 00:06:09.863
...believe me, this is your automobile.

62
00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:12.949
Why is it still running?

63
00:06:13.116 --> 00:06:14.618
Oh, all new cars do that.

64
00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:16.244
I'll take care of that in a second.

65
00:06:19.414 --> 00:06:22.959
You may think you hate it now, honey,
but wait until you drive it.

66
00:06:24.503 --> 00:06:26.671
Whoa! An air bag.

67
00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:30.092
You know, Clark, it's not too late
to fly out to California.

68
00:06:30.258 --> 00:06:31.510
We only have two weeks.

69
00:06:31.676 --> 00:06:34.679
Let's not get into that again,
sweetie pie. Please?

70
00:06:34.846 --> 00:06:38.725
Lots of families fly, Clark.
Especially cross-country.

71
00:06:38.892 --> 00:06:42.854
The whole idea of a family vacation
is to spend time together as a family.

72
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.440
You get on an airplane,
you put on your earphones...

73
00:06:45.607 --> 00:06:47.776
...and you're lost in your own world.

74
00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:50.153
It's an awfully long ride, Clark.

75
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.531
I'm looking forward
to an awfully long ride.

76
00:06:52.697 --> 00:06:57.160
You get to see the kids all the time.
I see them two minutes in the morning...

77
00:06:57.327 --> 00:07:00.747
...two minutes in the evening.
Maybe three hours on the weekend.

78
00:07:00.914 --> 00:07:04.960
Sheesh. One of these days I'm gonna
get up and realize that my little babies...

79
00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:07.170
...are all grown up. And then what?

80
00:07:07.838 --> 00:07:11.341
I just thought it might be easier to fly.

81
00:07:11.508 --> 00:07:14.719
Nothing worthwhile is easy, Ellen.

82
00:07:14.886 --> 00:07:16.888
We know that.

83
00:07:17.055 --> 00:07:18.181
Kids?

84
00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.309
Who wants to see the triptych?

85
00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:23.061
What? Dad, we're playing.

86
00:07:23.228 --> 00:07:27.065
Okay, shut off the video games.
Come on, Russ. Shut it off.

87
00:07:27.232 --> 00:07:30.443
I know you'll enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer...

88
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.488
...So we get the maximum amount
of fun time at Walley World...

89
00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:36.449
...without missing any of the good stuff
along the way.

90
00:07:36.616 --> 00:07:38.160
Here we go. There's us.

91
00:07:38.326 --> 00:07:39.744
And there's Walley World.

92
00:07:41.329 --> 00:07:43.498
Let's just take a look at Day One.
Shall we?

93
00:07:43.665 --> 00:07:46.376
Honey, come on in.
We're gonna do Day One.

94
00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:54.926
Okay, now there's the Family Truckster
as we leave Chicago.

95
00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:02.392
Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster.

96
00:08:03.727 --> 00:08:07.564
Russ, do you mind? I'm trying to work
this out here on the computer. Please.

97
00:08:09.191 --> 00:08:13.069
Okay, Audrey. Thank you, Audrey.
That's just great.

98
00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.031
Look out, Dad, here I come.

99
00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:17.782
All right, that's enough, Russ.

100
00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:19.993
Okay. Now, I think we're moving towards--

101
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.120
Thank you. Good shot, Audrey.

102
00:08:22.287 --> 00:08:24.831
Dad, I forgot. Why aren't we flying?

103
00:08:24.998 --> 00:08:28.793
Why aren't we flying? Because getting there
is half the fun. You know that.

104
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.715
I turned off the water,
the stove, the heat and the air.

105
00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:36.509
Locked the door, notified the police,
stopped the papers.

106
00:08:36.676 --> 00:08:38.094
I called to get the grass cut.

107
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:40.805
Did I put the timers
on the living-room lights?

108
00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:42.807
Oh, and don't forget the mail.

109
00:08:42.974 --> 00:08:45.477
- Watch that elbow. Keep your arm straight.
- Bye!

110
00:08:47.395 --> 00:08:48.563
- Bye!
- So long.

111
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.109
- Drive careful now, Clark.
- Watch out for the Indians, Clark.

112
00:08:53.276 --> 00:08:55.487
Watch those freeways.

113
00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:56.988
Oh, goodbye.

114
00:08:57.155 --> 00:08:58.949
Oh, I know I've forgotten something.

115
00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:01.326
Walley World, here we come.

116
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.874
- Come on, kids.
- We don't know any of your songs.

117
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.044
- Dad, is that made-up? It sounds made-up.
- Okay, I got one.

118
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:57.549
How about The Walley World
National Anthem? Huh?

119
00:09:58.341 --> 00:09:59.843
- Okay, okay, you start.
- Ahem.

120
00:10:35.462 --> 00:10:36.588
Yuck!

121
00:10:36.755 --> 00:10:37.922
That's me.

122
00:10:40.425 --> 00:10:42.302
All right. That's more like it.

123
00:10:42.469 --> 00:10:43.678
Here's one you don't know.

124
00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:46.931
We used to sing it when you were kids.
You're gonna like this. Ah...

125
00:11:30.642 --> 00:11:32.227
What smells in here, honey?

126
00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:35.230
Russ. Russ. Your feet.

127
00:12:31.995 --> 00:12:35.165
Clark, isn't this the gas tank?

128
00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:36.708
Yes, I know, honey.

129
00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:40.837
Get in the car.
I'm just fixing the license plate here.

130
00:12:46.176 --> 00:12:47.427
<i>Hey, see that, kids?</i>

131
00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:50.722
<i>That's the St. Louis Arch.
The Gateway to the West.</i>

132
00:12:50.889 --> 00:12:54.642
<i>It's over 600-feet tall, and there's
an elevator all the way to the top.</i>

133
00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:56.644
<i>That's 60 stories to you and me.</i>

134
00:12:56.811 --> 00:12:59.981
<i>- Wow, Dad, can we go up on it?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

135
00:13:00.148 --> 00:13:01.816
Dad, what river is this?

136
00:13:01.983 --> 00:13:04.736
That's the Mississippi.
The mighty Mississip.

137
00:13:06.154 --> 00:13:09.991
The Old Miss. The Old Man.

138
00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:21.878
Clark, I think this is the wrong exit.

139
00:13:22.045 --> 00:13:25.089
What's the difference,
as long as we get across the river?

140
00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:37.644
Clark? What are you doing?

141
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.605
- Just relax, Ellen.
- This is so dangerous.

142
00:13:40.772 --> 00:13:43.566
We have no business
being in an area like this.

143
00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:44.943
Well, look at it this way.

144
00:13:45.109 --> 00:13:47.278
This is a part of America
we never get to see.

145
00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:49.447
- That's good.
- No, that's bad.

146
00:13:49.614 --> 00:13:52.867
I mean, we can't close our eyes
to the plight of the cities.

147
00:13:53.034 --> 00:13:55.578
Kids, you noticing all this plight?

148
00:13:56.371 --> 00:13:58.456
This will just make us appreciate
what we have.

149
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.626
Roll them up.

150
00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:11.636
I'd better ask these fellas
how to get back on the expressway.

151
00:14:14.264 --> 00:14:15.682
Pardon me.

152
00:14:15.848 --> 00:14:19.143
I wonder if you could tell me
how to get back on the expressway?

153
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.313
- Fuck your mama.
- Thank you very much.

154
00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:29.404
Hey, Darnell, check out this Truckster.

155
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:30.863
It's a Truckster.

156
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.991
With a luggage rack.

157
00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:39.080
Hey, excuse me, homes? Heh-heh. Aha.

158
00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:42.417
What it is, bro. We're from out of town.

159
00:14:42.584 --> 00:14:43.626
No shit?

160
00:14:44.043 --> 00:14:46.754
I'd really appreciate it
if you could give me directions...

161
00:14:46.921 --> 00:14:48.715
...back onto the expressway.

162
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:51.676
- What? For free?
- Sure.

163
00:14:51.843 --> 00:14:53.761
Five dollars.

164
00:14:53.928 --> 00:14:57.599
- I'm not gonna give you $5 for directions.
- I think that's fair, Clark.

165
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:01.811
Okay. Here's $10.

166
00:15:01.978 --> 00:15:03.855
Thank you.

167
00:15:06.065 --> 00:15:07.108
Keep the change.

168
00:15:07.275 --> 00:15:10.528
Okay. Now, you see which way
you're pointing, right?

169
00:15:10.695 --> 00:15:12.196
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, that's good.

170
00:15:12.363 --> 00:15:13.781
Because, you see that place?

171
00:15:13.948 --> 00:15:17.160
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You see where it say, "Rib Tips"?

172
00:15:17.327 --> 00:15:18.536
- Rib Tips.
- Mm-hm. Fuck that.

173
00:15:18.703 --> 00:15:20.496
You don't want to go that way.

174
00:15:20.663 --> 00:15:22.624
I wonder if these guys
know the Commodores.

175
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:25.293
You gonna go all the way down
about half a block...

176
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.046
...and you'll see a Torino
with no wheels on it.

177
00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:31.132
Inside that Torino is my cousin, Jackie.

178
00:15:31.299 --> 00:15:33.551
You tell him that you're my boy,
and you're lost.

179
00:15:33.718 --> 00:15:35.720
He'll make sure
you get where you're going.

180
00:15:35.887 --> 00:15:38.806
You don't want to know from me.
This ain't my neighborhood.

181
00:15:38.973 --> 00:15:41.684
I'm from the west side of Chicago,
here on vacation.

182
00:15:41.851 --> 00:15:44.395
Thanks a lot. You've been a great help.

183
00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.029
- Honey?
- Hmm.

184
00:15:54.947 --> 00:15:56.866
This reminds me of the time in college...

185
00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:59.911
...when we drove down to Fort Lauderdale
in my Austin-Healy.

186
00:16:00.078 --> 00:16:03.581
I haven't thought about that
for a long time.

187
00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:07.001
Remember what we did in the car?

188
00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:10.380
It's amazing we didn't get in an accident.

189
00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:12.173
Want to relive a fond memory?

190
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.217
Are you serious?

191
00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:16.636
- No.
- Why not?

192
00:16:16.803 --> 00:16:19.347
Because, that's why.

193
00:16:20.348 --> 00:16:21.599
The kids are asleep.

194
00:16:21.766 --> 00:16:26.020
Let's just wait until we get to a motel.

195
00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:32.610
Okay, we'll wait.
I gotta find the best one on the road.

196
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:34.946
Do you want to put your head in my lap?

197
00:16:35.113 --> 00:16:37.115
That's not what I was thinking.

198
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.661
The wheel. Let me get this.

199
00:16:41.828 --> 00:16:44.372
There you go, move it out of your way.

200
00:16:44.539 --> 00:16:46.165
Comfy?

201
00:16:48.209 --> 00:16:49.627
Clark?

202
00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:52.296
Clark, my head's stuck.

203
00:16:55.341 --> 00:16:57.385
Clark, quit kidding around. It hurts.

204
00:16:57.552 --> 00:16:59.011
It's stuck.

205
00:16:59.178 --> 00:17:01.848
Cut it out.

206
00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:06.102
I know what you're trying to do,
and I think it's sick.

207
00:17:07.979 --> 00:17:09.856
The wheel's stuck.

208
00:17:11.482 --> 00:17:13.276
That was a dirty trick.

209
00:17:13.443 --> 00:17:15.111
The damn wheel is all screwed up.

210
00:17:15.278 --> 00:17:17.739
You're tired.
You get weird when you get tired.

211
00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:21.909
Let's just find a motel.
I don't want you dozing off.

212
00:17:22.076 --> 00:17:24.829
I'm not tired. Are you kidding?

213
00:17:25.163 --> 00:17:27.832
I could go another 100 miles. Come on.

214
00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:29.834
No problem.

215
00:18:37.151 --> 00:18:42.615
Sparky, why don't you turn off the TV
and come to bed?

216
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:45.868
Okay, honey.

217
00:19:05.304 --> 00:19:07.974
Well, up and at them. We're here.

218
00:19:32.665 --> 00:19:34.458
Clark.

219
00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:37.795
- Can I do your back, honey?
- I've already done my back.

220
00:19:37.962 --> 00:19:39.338
Can I do your front?

221
00:19:39.505 --> 00:19:41.299
Go do your own front.

222
00:19:46.721 --> 00:19:49.640
You know Clark, maybe we should
call Catherine and Eddie...

223
00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:53.603
...and tell them that we won't be in
until tomorrow afternoon.

224
00:19:53.769 --> 00:19:55.187
Afternoon?

225
00:19:55.354 --> 00:19:59.025
If we're not there by 10:00 a.m., it's
gonna throw the schedule completely off.

226
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:01.152
I planned everything very carefully...

227
00:20:01.319 --> 00:20:04.822
...so we'd be at Walley World
first thing Saturday morning.

228
00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:09.285
Sparky, I know how much
this trip means to you...

229
00:20:09.452 --> 00:20:12.622
...and that you want all of us
to have a great time...

230
00:20:12.788 --> 00:20:15.499
...but it's a long way to Walley World.

231
00:20:15.666 --> 00:20:20.254
And I think it'd be easier on all of us
if you'd just try to relax.

232
00:20:22.381 --> 00:20:24.800
I'm way ahead of you, honey.

233
00:20:33.351 --> 00:20:34.685
When did you get these?

234
00:20:34.852 --> 00:20:37.355
I have my little secrets.

235
00:20:40.524 --> 00:20:42.818
What a nice thought.

236
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.743
Don't drink yet.

237
00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:59.543
Ready for this?

238
00:21:05.508 --> 00:21:10.388
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.

239
00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:14.225
Here's to a very restful vacation.

240
00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:18.354
Here's to a very relaxing vacation...

241
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:21.107
...a renewed love affair...

242
00:21:22.733 --> 00:21:26.153
...and a time of joy with our babies.

243
00:21:30.032 --> 00:21:31.951
You know, honey, I never told you this.

244
00:21:32.118 --> 00:21:34.370
I know it's been a rough beginning.

245
00:21:34.537 --> 00:21:36.580
I think there's something wrong here.

246
00:21:36.747 --> 00:21:39.375
It's the bed. It will slow up in a second.

247
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:43.504
I got it. Hold on to this. Enjoy it.

248
00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.174
- Clark, what are you doing?
- Let's try this, my darling.

249
00:21:49.593 --> 00:21:51.804
Now we're talking.

250
00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.598
We haven't done this for a long time.

251
00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:00.271
Oh. Clark.

252
00:22:00.521 --> 00:22:02.648
- What's that noise?
- What's going on?

253
00:22:02.815 --> 00:22:06.527
Hey. Don't you kids knock anymore?

254
00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:09.572
Sorry, we thought you were fighting
or something.

255
00:22:09.739 --> 00:22:12.033
Nobody is fighting in here.

256
00:22:13.951 --> 00:22:15.327
It's very late.

257
00:22:15.494 --> 00:22:16.829
Where is Mom?

258
00:22:16.996 --> 00:22:18.748
I'm under here, kids.

259
00:22:18.914 --> 00:22:20.958
Go back to bed.

260
00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.461
Go back to bed, now. Rusty.

261
00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.212
The bed was very soft.

262
00:22:25.379 --> 00:22:27.673
Weird-o-rama.

263
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.467
Really.

264
00:22:31.802 --> 00:22:35.347
This is the street Wyatt Earp
used to keep law and order on.

265
00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:37.933
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.

266
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.311
Oh, Ellen, the Old West was dirty.

267
00:22:40.478 --> 00:22:43.147
Everything isn't like home.
If everything were like home...

268
00:22:43.314 --> 00:22:45.316
...there'd be no reason
for leaving. Right?

269
00:22:45.483 --> 00:22:47.151
Oh, yeah, Dad. This is great.

270
00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:51.238
- You know, I'm glad we didn't go to Hawaii.
- I'll bet you are.

271
00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.536
Okay. Kids!

272
00:22:57.703 --> 00:23:00.498
Let's go get a drink. What do you say?
Here you go, champ.

273
00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:04.585
Well.

274
00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:09.215
Howdy, city slickers.

275
00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:12.927
Welcome to the Long Branch.
No fighting, no cussing, no gunslinging.

276
00:23:13.094 --> 00:23:17.014
Watch what you say to our bartender.
He's an ornery cuss.

277
00:23:17.223 --> 00:23:19.016
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- Marshal.

278
00:23:19.183 --> 00:23:20.684
Oh. Sorry.

279
00:23:20.851 --> 00:23:22.103
It's no sweat.

280
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:24.188
Give me five, partner.

281
00:23:27.983 --> 00:23:30.986
That guy was a crummy Wyatt Earp.
He's wearing jogging shoes.

282
00:23:31.153 --> 00:23:32.613
They used to, Rusty.

283
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.242
Hey, knucklehead.
Set us up with four redeyes, will you?

284
00:23:38.077 --> 00:23:40.037
Hey, yellow-belly. I'm talking to you.

285
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:46.877
Hey, tenderfoot.
Move your chicken wings, turkey.

286
00:23:53.259 --> 00:23:55.261
Clark. That's not nice.

287
00:23:55.427 --> 00:23:57.972
It's all part of the act, hon.

288
00:23:58.139 --> 00:23:59.515
Hey, underpants.

289
00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:01.308
Hey, yellow--

290
00:24:02.434 --> 00:24:04.061
Clark!

291
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.522
I'm okay. I'm okay.

292
00:24:06.689 --> 00:24:08.023
I'm all right.

293
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:14.155
I don't think that's very funny. A noise
like that could impair the kids' hearing.

294
00:24:14.321 --> 00:24:16.198
Oh, come on.

295
00:24:16.365 --> 00:24:19.702
It was real. It looked real, didn't it?
Hell, I thought it was a real gun.

296
00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:21.912
Didn't it look real when I fell down, hon?

297
00:24:22.079 --> 00:24:23.956
- What?
- Didn't it look real, sweetie?

298
00:24:24.123 --> 00:24:26.625
- What?
- Are you happy now, Clark?

299
00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:28.961
- She's deaf.
- What's the difference?

300
00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:31.755
It was fun anyway. Let's have a drink.
What do you say?

301
00:24:31.922 --> 00:24:33.257
Pardon me, sir?

302
00:24:38.512 --> 00:24:41.182
Catherine said we just stay on 50.

303
00:24:41.348 --> 00:24:43.976
Well, I was thinking about
shooting over to 54...

304
00:24:44.143 --> 00:24:46.312
- ...and zipping down to Liberal.
- What for?

305
00:24:46.478 --> 00:24:48.564
- The House of Mud.
- What's the House of Mud?

306
00:24:48.731 --> 00:24:52.318
It's only the largest freestanding
mud dwelling ever built, that's all.

307
00:24:52.484 --> 00:24:55.696
You see, kids, the pioneers
didn't have bricks, so they used mud.

308
00:24:55.863 --> 00:24:58.449
They didn't use mud, they used sod, Dad.

309
00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:01.535
Right, Audrey, and when they
ran out of sod, they used mud.

310
00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:04.914
Clark, let's just skip the House of Mud.

311
00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:07.708
I think Dodge City
was enough for one day.

312
00:25:07.875 --> 00:25:11.503
Besides, Catherine and Eddie
are expecting us.

313
00:25:12.338 --> 00:25:13.923
It's living history, Ellen.

314
00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:16.508
But if you'd rather see your cousins...

315
00:25:16.675 --> 00:25:17.885
...it's okay by me.

316
00:25:18.052 --> 00:25:20.763
Personally, I'd rather see a pile
of mud than Eddie.

317
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.641
- Knock it off.
- What's going on?

318
00:25:23.807 --> 00:25:26.101
Rusty is licking his hand
and touching me with it.

319
00:25:26.268 --> 00:25:28.479
Clark, tell Rusty to behave himself.

320
00:25:28.646 --> 00:25:30.272
Rusty, behave yourself.

321
00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:33.651
Audrey's eating peanut butter
and smiling with it all over her teeth.

322
00:25:33.817 --> 00:25:35.903
Audrey, eat with your mouth closed.

323
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.823
- No eating in the car, kids.
- You suck, you know that?

324
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.285
- Retard.
- I am trying to concentrate on the road.

325
00:25:55.005 --> 00:25:56.382
What did you say?

326
00:25:57.883 --> 00:26:01.512
Stop it, both of you.
Just give me the peanut butter.

327
00:26:07.142 --> 00:26:09.603
- He started it!
- I don't care who started it!

328
00:26:11.897 --> 00:26:13.232
I don't care who started it.

329
00:26:13.399 --> 00:26:16.318
I don't want to hear another word
out of either one of you.

330
00:26:26.245 --> 00:26:28.872
Clark, you're doing 80 miles an hour.

331
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:31.875
- Doesn't seem like it, does it?
- Slow down.

332
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.546
I don't know why.
We're making good time.

333
00:27:01.113 --> 00:27:03.324
Oh, they're here. Eddie, come on.

334
00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.410
Oh, I can't believe it. It's been an age!

335
00:27:06.577 --> 00:27:09.163
I never thought we'd get out here,
you look great!

336
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.499
- Eddie, get down here.
- Eddie, you look terrific.

337
00:27:12.666 --> 00:27:15.085
- Ellen, how are you?
- I never thought you'd get here.

338
00:27:15.252 --> 00:27:16.962
Good to see you.

339
00:27:17.129 --> 00:27:20.632
Come and meet your second cousins.
Look how they've grown.

340
00:27:20.799 --> 00:27:23.135
And you have lost weight, Catherine.

341
00:27:23.302 --> 00:27:25.971
Yeah, added a few more mouths
to the litter.

342
00:27:27.473 --> 00:27:31.602
Let's see. Rusty and Audrey,
cousins Vicki and Dale.

343
00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:33.008
Hi.

344
00:27:33.217 --> 00:27:36.273
And this is Eddie
Junior and this is Junior.

345
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.276
And this little moppet
on my skirts is Daisy-Mabel.

346
00:27:39.443 --> 00:27:41.695
Well. How old are you, little one?

347
00:27:41.862 --> 00:27:45.115
- She was born without a tongue, Clark.
- Ooh.

348
00:27:45.282 --> 00:27:48.452
But don't worry about her. She whistles
like a bird and eats like a horse.

349
00:27:50.287 --> 00:27:53.248
Take your little guests out back
and show them your worm farm.

350
00:27:53.415 --> 00:27:56.126
Go on, scoot.
Ellen, come in the house.

351
00:27:56.293 --> 00:28:00.130
- I've got so much to tell you.
- Look at the flowers. I love them.

352
00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:05.094
Oh, boy. Look at that car.

353
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.388
Yeah, that's the Family Truckster.

354
00:28:07.554 --> 00:28:11.308
Boy, she's a beaut.
I like those green walls.

355
00:28:11.475 --> 00:28:14.311
We had some trouble in St. Louis.

356
00:28:14.895 --> 00:28:18.607
So you're looking really...

357
00:28:18.774 --> 00:28:20.275
...fit.

358
00:28:21.276 --> 00:28:23.654
This is the old homestead, huh?

359
00:28:25.906 --> 00:28:29.785
Yeah, I don't know for how long, though.

360
00:28:29.952 --> 00:28:33.330
The bank's been after me
like flies on a rib roast.

361
00:28:33.497 --> 00:28:35.958
Yeah. I know the feeling.

362
00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:38.544
Fuck it.

363
00:28:43.507 --> 00:28:46.009
- I bet you could use a cool one, huh?
- Now you're talking.

364
00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.441
I'm going steady. And I French kiss.

365
00:29:01.316 --> 00:29:05.487
- So? Everyone does that.
- Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best at it.

366
00:29:09.366 --> 00:29:10.993
Want a worm?

367
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.036
No, thanks.

368
00:29:13.912 --> 00:29:15.747
Hey, you got <i>Pac-Man?</i>

369
00:29:16.707 --> 00:29:17.791
No.

370
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:20.210
You got <i>Space Invaders?</i>

371
00:29:20.711 --> 00:29:22.171
Nope.

372
00:29:22.754 --> 00:29:25.966
- You got <i>Asteroids?</i>
- No, but my dad does.

373
00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:28.969
He can't even sit on the toilet some days.

374
00:29:31.638 --> 00:29:33.974
So, what do you do here, Dale?

375
00:29:34.141 --> 00:29:35.559
Well...

376
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.770
...I got a stack of nudie books this high.

377
00:29:40.647 --> 00:29:43.358
Oh, she's beautiful.

378
00:29:46.737 --> 00:29:51.909
- Would you sell me any of them?
- Shit, no. I cherish these things.

379
00:29:53.285 --> 00:29:54.828
I use them a lot.

380
00:29:57.164 --> 00:29:58.665
How do you use a magazine?

381
00:29:58.832 --> 00:30:01.585
I was getting to that.

382
00:30:01.752 --> 00:30:05.964
A guy taught me something
really neat last year.

383
00:30:07.007 --> 00:30:08.425
Did you ever bop your baloney?

384
00:30:15.557 --> 00:30:18.018
I guess we're 11, aren't we?

385
00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:22.773
- No, we're 12 with Aunt Edna.
- Aunt Edna? She's still alive?

386
00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.399
Oh, you bet.

387
00:30:24.566 --> 00:30:28.362
I can't wait to see the look on
Clark's face when he hears that.

388
00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:31.782
Well, she came to help out
when Eddie ruptured his spleen...

389
00:30:31.949 --> 00:30:34.284
...and she's been with us ever since.

390
00:30:34.451 --> 00:30:36.912
She wanted to go back
to Phoenix a year ago...

391
00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:39.081
...but Eddie wouldn't let her.

392
00:30:40.082 --> 00:30:44.503
Frankly, without her Social Security,
we'd never be able to live like this.

393
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.175
Gee, Cath, it looks like
you've really got your hands full.

394
00:30:50.342 --> 00:30:53.178
Oh, it's not so bad.

395
00:30:53.345 --> 00:30:56.890
Eddie says after the baby comes,
I can quit one of my night jobs.

396
00:31:01.728 --> 00:31:03.480
How do you like yours, Clark?

397
00:31:03.647 --> 00:31:05.941
Oh, medium-rare, a little pink inside.

398
00:31:06.108 --> 00:31:08.443
No, your bun. Light or dark?

399
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.321
Oh. Either way, it doesn't matter.

400
00:31:12.531 --> 00:31:16.034
Vicki, can I help you with that Kool-Aid?
Please?

401
00:31:18.518 --> 00:31:21.072
I don't know why they call
this stuff Hamburger Helper.

402
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.292
It does just fine by itself.

403
00:31:23.458 --> 00:31:27.254
I like it better than Tuna Helper myself.
Don't you, Clark?

404
00:31:27.421 --> 00:31:30.299
You're the gourmet around here, Ed. Heh.

405
00:31:35.345 --> 00:31:36.638
No meat in this?

406
00:31:36.805 --> 00:31:40.642
You get plenty of meat at home.
Be polite. Have some ketchup.

407
00:31:45.314 --> 00:31:47.024
Real tomato ketchup, Eddie?

408
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.359
Nothing but the best.

409
00:31:50.736 --> 00:31:53.947
Aunt Edna. Helper's getting cold.

410
00:31:55.699 --> 00:31:57.743
Is that your Aunt Edna?

411
00:32:05.876 --> 00:32:11.089
Aunt Edna. After all these years.
You're looking so good.

412
00:32:15.177 --> 00:32:17.804
Hi, Edna. Nice to see you again.

413
00:32:18.472 --> 00:32:21.099
You remember Clark, don't you?

414
00:32:23.477 --> 00:32:26.563
You were the ones who sent me
the fruitcake for Christmas.

415
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.274
It made me so sick.

416
00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:33.153
I'm sorry.
We thought you enjoyed fruitcake.

417
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.906
You enjoy throwing up
every five minutes, Claude?

418
00:32:36.073 --> 00:32:39.242
- Clark.
- I thought so.

419
00:32:39.618 --> 00:32:43.705
Well, am I going to eat
or am I gonna starve to death?

420
00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:48.251
Catherine.

421
00:32:48.418 --> 00:32:52.047
Did you tell Clark and Ellen
the good news?

422
00:32:52.214 --> 00:32:54.633
No. I was just about to.

423
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.843
Catherine, what's the good news?

424
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.347
You're driving me to Phoenix.

425
00:33:12.109 --> 00:33:14.569
Junior Pig Competition?

426
00:33:15.112 --> 00:33:16.780
You won this for raising a pig?

427
00:33:16.947 --> 00:33:19.533
Yeah. First Place.

428
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.494
Does anybody know about it?

429
00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:23.912
Everybody knows.

430
00:33:25.288 --> 00:33:30.460
Vicki, don't get offended, but being
a farmer is not too cool, you know.

431
00:33:32.254 --> 00:33:34.089
Oh, yeah?

432
00:33:34.381 --> 00:33:38.218
Well, how cool...

433
00:33:38.385 --> 00:33:40.095
...is this?

434
00:33:47.144 --> 00:33:51.440
I'm real glad that things
are going good for you, Clark.

435
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:55.235
Mm-hm. Tsk.

436
00:33:55.402 --> 00:34:00.991
I got laid off when they closed
that asbestos factory. Ahem.

437
00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:02.868
And now, wouldn't you know it...

438
00:34:03.034 --> 00:34:05.120
...the Army cut my disability pension...

439
00:34:05.287 --> 00:34:10.292
...because they said the plate in my head
wasn't big enough. Shoo.

440
00:34:13.587 --> 00:34:16.923
Eddie, Clark and Ellen don't want to hear
about our troubles.

441
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.550
No, no. It's very interesting.

442
00:34:18.717 --> 00:34:21.762
Why don't you just ask him
for the money, Eddie?

443
00:34:21.928 --> 00:34:23.764
He sure as hell can't take a hint.

444
00:34:24.556 --> 00:34:28.727
Well, I didn't want to ask you,
Clark, you know, but...

445
00:34:28.894 --> 00:34:32.606
Could you, maybe,
spare a little extra cash?

446
00:34:32.773 --> 00:34:34.816
Sure, Eddie.

447
00:34:39.237 --> 00:34:40.822
How much do you need?

448
00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.991
About $52,000.

449
00:34:46.286 --> 00:34:48.622
Goodbye, baby.

450
00:34:48.789 --> 00:34:50.624
And you'll send those checks?

451
00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:52.918
- All taken care of.
- Okay.

452
00:34:53.084 --> 00:34:56.546
- Okay, let's go. Come on, Edna.
- Lay off, lay off.

453
00:34:57.464 --> 00:34:59.549
Well, gotta be going.

454
00:34:59.716 --> 00:35:02.219
- What's this?
- This is for you, Clark.

455
00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:04.137
Oh, what is it?

456
00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:07.724
- Gift.
- You didn't have to buy me a gift, Eddie.

457
00:35:07.891 --> 00:35:09.184
Oh, go on, open it.

458
00:35:12.395 --> 00:35:14.981
Oh, Eddie, you shouldn't have.

459
00:35:15.148 --> 00:35:17.901
- You really shouldn't have.
- Those are great, Dad.

460
00:35:18.068 --> 00:35:20.612
- Quiet down, Russ.
- Try them on.

461
00:35:20.779 --> 00:35:22.447
No, I don't want to get them dirty.

462
00:35:22.614 --> 00:35:24.741
I told you he wouldn't like them, Eddie.

463
00:35:25.826 --> 00:35:27.494
- I love them.
- I knew you did...

464
00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:31.248
...because the last time I saw you you
remarked about how much you liked mine.

465
00:35:31.414 --> 00:35:34.668
- Well, I guess we'd better be going.
- Yeah.

466
00:35:36.419 --> 00:35:37.504
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Ellen.

467
00:35:37.671 --> 00:35:41.049
- Bye, Clark. It's was great having you here.
- Goodbye. Thank you. Okay.

468
00:35:42.008 --> 00:35:44.636
Here he is, Uncle Clark,
all walked and everything.

469
00:35:44.803 --> 00:35:46.304
What is this? A dog?

470
00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:49.724
He's Aunt Edna's. His name is Dinky.
He watches <i>Family Feud.</i>

471
00:35:50.433 --> 00:35:52.769
Oh. Hi, how are you, little fellow?

472
00:35:54.437 --> 00:35:55.939
Easy.

473
00:35:56.189 --> 00:35:59.818
Yeah. You folks didn't
get to meet Dinky last night.

474
00:35:59.985 --> 00:36:02.237
He had the shits, so he slept in the barn.

475
00:36:02.612 --> 00:36:06.449
Ah. Well, great. Better make some space
for him in the back. Come on.

476
00:36:07.784 --> 00:36:10.745
Ow! No. No. Sit, sit. Roll over.
Come on, heel.

477
00:36:10.912 --> 00:36:14.457
- Here. Have a good trip.
- Thanks, Vic.

478
00:36:20.755 --> 00:36:25.594
Bye! Bye, kids, bye, Aunt Edna. Bye-bye!

479
00:36:42.152 --> 00:36:44.905
Look at these sandwiches.
Here, Aunt Edna.

480
00:36:45.071 --> 00:36:46.656
Thank you.

481
00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:48.325
Audrey.

482
00:36:49.284 --> 00:36:52.329
Oh, Rusty, stop playing with the dog
and come and have some lunch.

483
00:36:58.043 --> 00:36:59.586
Oh, Clark, look.

484
00:36:59.753 --> 00:37:02.839
Your favorite, baloney and cheese.

485
00:37:05.717 --> 00:37:07.969
And what should I have?

486
00:37:08.136 --> 00:37:12.140
Maybe some fruit or something like that.

487
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:18.790
Mom, my sandwich is all wet.

488
00:38:18.957 --> 00:38:20.834
Well, they're all wet.

489
00:38:21.668 --> 00:38:26.047
Oh, God. The dog went
on the picnic basket.

490
00:39:25.565 --> 00:39:27.150
Russ, look.

491
00:39:27.317 --> 00:39:29.986
Excellent. They have a pool.

492
00:39:30.904 --> 00:39:33.490
Aren't the woods beautiful?

493
00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:37.494
Clark. Dinkums needs a long walk
and a bath.

494
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.288
Rusty, take care of Dinkums.

495
00:39:40.455 --> 00:39:43.500
- Dad, he bites.
- Bite him back.

496
00:40:00.934 --> 00:40:04.896
- We'd like three tents for the night, please.
- All right. That'll be $37.

497
00:40:05.063 --> 00:40:07.190
Thirty-seven dollars
for three tents?

498
00:40:07.357 --> 00:40:08.691
Oh, they're very nice tents.

499
00:40:08.858 --> 00:40:12.195
And that price includes scenery
and wildlife fun.

500
00:40:14.197 --> 00:40:16.533
Oh, come on, Clark.
It seems like a nice place.

501
00:40:16.699 --> 00:40:19.410
It's got a pool and everything.

502
00:40:19.577 --> 00:40:22.163
- All right.
- Here you go.

503
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.916
Fill out that.

504
00:40:29.212 --> 00:40:32.173
Clark W. Griswold. You want my street?

505
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.383
Please.

506
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.636
- What do you need my address for?
- We like to send out a mailer.

507
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.725
- I can't wait to get in.
- Me, too.

508
00:40:42.892 --> 00:40:44.561
Get our bathing--

509
00:40:47.647 --> 00:40:50.316
That's disgusting.

510
00:40:54.445 --> 00:40:56.656
Too cheap to pay for a hotel room, huh?

511
00:40:58.908 --> 00:41:02.662
Ooh. Clark, this tent smells.

512
00:41:03.413 --> 00:41:04.706
Edna, this is your tent.

513
00:41:24.267 --> 00:41:26.269
Sp-- Sparky.

514
00:41:26.436 --> 00:41:29.606
- This isn't very romantic.
- Isn't it?

515
00:41:29.772 --> 00:41:34.652
No, I don't think there's enough room
for two in this sleeping bag.

516
00:41:34.819 --> 00:41:37.614
Honey, right now, we're one.

517
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.826
- One heart beating for two.
- Oh, Sparky.

518
00:41:47.165 --> 00:41:49.709
Sparky, there's a wild animal.

519
00:41:49.876 --> 00:41:51.127
- Yeah.
- No.

520
00:41:51.294 --> 00:41:54.339
- I know, I'm gonna go for it, honey.
- Wild animal-- No.

521
00:41:56.674 --> 00:41:59.427
Ow! Get off. Down. Go.

522
00:42:00.136 --> 00:42:02.597
I'm sorry, honey. It's Dinky. Get off!

523
00:42:06.476 --> 00:42:08.269
I'll kill that dog.

524
00:42:10.355 --> 00:42:11.814
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:19.322 --> 00:42:21.824
What do you say, honey? Uhn!

526
00:42:21.991 --> 00:42:25.119
In spite of all the little problems,
it really is fun, isn't it?

527
00:42:25.286 --> 00:42:26.621
No.

528
00:42:26.788 --> 00:42:30.166
But with every new day
there's fresh hope.

529
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:34.087
Hey, kids, let's go.

530
00:42:34.254 --> 00:42:36.339
We're losing daylight here.

531
00:42:36.965 --> 00:42:38.341
Hey, did you walk him?

532
00:42:38.508 --> 00:42:41.135
Yeah. He took a big one
on Aunt Edna's blanket.

533
00:42:41.678 --> 00:42:43.972
- Good boy.
- Help!

534
00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:46.432
Oh, boy. Go take care of Aunt Edna.
I'll take the leash.

535
00:42:51.104 --> 00:42:53.481
Roll over. Ow.

536
00:42:54.732 --> 00:42:55.775
Dinky.

537
00:42:56.192 --> 00:42:58.945
Ow! You're tearing my flesh!

538
00:42:59.112 --> 00:43:02.824
Good morning, Edna. Ah!
No, Dinky. Sit. Roll over.

539
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:08.162
Audrey, you're next.

540
00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:10.123
- No way, José.
- Hey, Audrey.

541
00:43:11.666 --> 00:43:12.709
What's the problem?

542
00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:16.671
Ma, I had to sit next to Aunt Edna
last time. She smells like mothballs.

543
00:43:16.838 --> 00:43:17.964
Anyway, it's her turn.

544
00:43:18.131 --> 00:43:22.051
For your information,
Rusty slept in his underpants last night.

545
00:43:22.218 --> 00:43:24.887
- Yeah, I did.
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy, kids. Cut it out.

546
00:43:25.054 --> 00:43:28.641
Everybody in the car,
boat leaves in two minutes.

547
00:43:28.808 --> 00:43:32.478
Or perhaps, you don't want to see
the second-largest ball of twine on Earth.

548
00:43:32.645 --> 00:43:34.314
Which is only four short hours away.

549
00:43:41.863 --> 00:43:43.740
Sweetie, do you hear that rattle?

550
00:43:44.073 --> 00:43:46.909
- Where is it coming from?
- Beats the heck out of me.

551
00:43:47.076 --> 00:43:50.663
I've been looking for it ever since we left.
It's driving me crazy.

552
00:43:51.122 --> 00:43:53.750
God, Dad, check it out behind you.

553
00:43:53.916 --> 00:43:55.793
Oh, shoot. Now what have we done?

554
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:58.755
- Will you hold my purse?
- Huh?

555
00:43:58.921 --> 00:44:01.090
Just hold my purse.

556
00:44:20.943 --> 00:44:23.112
Hello, officer. What's the problem?

557
00:44:25.782 --> 00:44:27.825
Get out of the car.

558
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.542
I don't think I was speeding.
Was I weaving?

559
00:44:36.709 --> 00:44:38.711
Shut your mouth, sir.

560
00:44:40.254 --> 00:44:43.841
If I wasn't in uniform, I'd split your skull
with the butt of this revolver...

561
00:44:44.008 --> 00:44:46.677
...faster than you could say
"police brutality."

562
00:44:47.136 --> 00:44:50.598
Well, officer, whatever it is I've done,
I'm sure I can explain.

563
00:44:54.727 --> 00:44:57.188
Explain this, you son of a bitch.

564
00:44:57.355 --> 00:44:59.273
Oh, my God.

565
00:45:00.525 --> 00:45:04.821
Do you know what the penalty
for animal cruelty is in this state?

566
00:45:04.987 --> 00:45:06.572
No, sir, I don't.

567
00:45:06.864 --> 00:45:08.324
Well...

568
00:45:08.991 --> 00:45:10.576
It's probably pretty stiff.

569
00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:14.038
You can't think
I'd do this on purpose, sir.

570
00:45:14.205 --> 00:45:17.875
Look, I tied him to the rear bumper
when I was packing the car.

571
00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:20.837
It was very confusing, I must've forgot.

572
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.715
I'm very sorry. I feel terrible.

573
00:45:25.299 --> 00:45:27.802
How do you think that little dog feels?

574
00:45:32.473 --> 00:45:36.227
Look, I told you I was sorry.
It really was an accident.

575
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.190
Yeah. I guess I can buy that, sir.

576
00:45:41.357 --> 00:45:43.317
But it is a shame.

577
00:45:43.734 --> 00:45:46.612
I had a pooch like this when I was a kid.

578
00:45:49.198 --> 00:45:50.450
Poor little guy.

579
00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:53.536
He probably kept up with you
for a mile or so.

580
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:56.289
- Tough little mutt.
- Tough.

581
00:45:56.456 --> 00:45:58.666
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

582
00:46:06.591 --> 00:46:09.010
I was afraid you'd get pulled over, Clark.

583
00:46:09.177 --> 00:46:12.889
You've been exceeding the speed limit
for thousands of miles.

584
00:46:13.055 --> 00:46:15.892
Dad wasn't speeding.
The cop stopped us because Dad forgot--

585
00:46:16.058 --> 00:46:18.853
- He was speeding, Rusty.
- No, he wasn't, Mom.

586
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.647
Russ! Listen to your mother.
I was speeding.

587
00:46:21.814 --> 00:46:23.191
I was driving like a maniac.

588
00:46:23.357 --> 00:46:25.860
We can all be grateful
to this man for stopping us.

589
00:46:26.027 --> 00:46:27.737
- You see, a car--
- Here's the leash.

590
00:46:27.904 --> 00:46:30.531
I'm going to get the rest
of the carcass off the road.

591
00:46:30.698 --> 00:46:32.450
- Thank you, officer.
- See you.

592
00:46:32.617 --> 00:46:34.202
Have a nice day.

593
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.051
This your idea of a good restaurant?

594
00:46:50.218 --> 00:46:52.303
Dog killer.

595
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.764
I'm sure the food is just fine.

596
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:57.141
Uh-uh-uh. New car, I'll take it.

597
00:46:57.308 --> 00:46:58.643
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

598
00:46:58.809 --> 00:47:01.896
Oh, kids. Oh, kids. Mm-mm.

599
00:47:04.941 --> 00:47:05.983
Waitress.

600
00:48:16.178 --> 00:48:17.847
What happened?

601
00:48:19.098 --> 00:48:21.559
What happened to your hair?

602
00:48:22.101 --> 00:48:23.436
You're sweating.

603
00:48:23.603 --> 00:48:26.689
- Are you blushing?
- Don't be silly.

604
00:48:26.856 --> 00:48:28.357
Are you all right, Clark?

605
00:48:28.524 --> 00:48:30.735
Hell, yes. I'm fine. I'm having a ball.

606
00:48:37.992 --> 00:48:40.369
Come on, honey, look at the mountains,
breathe the air.

607
00:48:43.539 --> 00:48:46.208
Put on a happy face for me.

608
00:48:50.755 --> 00:48:54.216
I guess there's not much more
that can happen to us.

609
00:48:54.383 --> 00:48:56.844
I think the worst is behind us.

610
00:49:05.269 --> 00:49:07.813
Clark, I need my vanity case.

611
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:10.066
We've got to go back and look for it.

612
00:49:10.232 --> 00:49:11.901
All my credit cards are in it.

613
00:49:12.068 --> 00:49:15.738
Honey, number one, I've already called
the bank and told them you've lost them.

614
00:49:15.905 --> 00:49:19.241
B, there's no way we're gonna find it.
We don't know where it fell off.

615
00:49:19.408 --> 00:49:23.079
And three, I've got my credit cards
and we've still got plenty of cash. Okay?

616
00:49:23.245 --> 00:49:25.998
No, we don't. You gave $500 to Eddie...

617
00:49:26.165 --> 00:49:29.752
...and everything has cost twice
as much as you figured out.

618
00:49:29.919 --> 00:49:32.463
There's nothing in that luggage
that can't be replaced.

619
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.674
Except for your diaphragm.

620
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.218
We can always cash a check
down the road.

621
00:49:37.385 --> 00:49:38.969
Don't you trust me?

622
00:49:39.136 --> 00:49:42.765
As long as you don't tie me
to the rear bumper.

623
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:47.269
That hurt, Ellen.

624
00:49:48.312 --> 00:49:51.607
- Clark, I think we're lost.
- We're not lost.

625
00:49:51.774 --> 00:49:53.776
Will you please let me do the driving?

626
00:49:53.943 --> 00:49:58.280
I honestly don't think you're gonna
find the Grand Canyon on this road.

627
00:49:58.447 --> 00:50:01.075
Jesus, it's only the biggest
goddamn hole in the world.

628
00:50:01.242 --> 00:50:03.077
Clark, watch your language.

629
00:50:03.244 --> 00:50:04.995
Make that the second-biggest.

630
00:50:05.162 --> 00:50:07.957
Dad, I haven't seen a car for an hour.

631
00:50:08.124 --> 00:50:10.876
Shut up, Audrey. You don't think
Dad knows where he's going?

632
00:50:11.043 --> 00:50:13.295
- Thank you, Russ.
- You're lost.

633
00:50:15.297 --> 00:50:18.134
- I saw some detour signs.
- I didn't see any.

634
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.554
I saw them when you and Mom
were trying to fold the map.

635
00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:24.932
When they close a road
they put up big signs. Like this one.

636
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:50.291
- I think I broke my nose.
- I stabbed my brain.

637
00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:53.002
I just got my period.

638
00:50:53.169 --> 00:50:55.296
I'd better check under the hood.

639
00:51:07.808 --> 00:51:10.311
Audrey, gather up the clothes
and put them in a pile.

640
00:51:10.478 --> 00:51:13.773
Rusty, find the first-aid kit,
then get the suitcases.

641
00:51:13.939 --> 00:51:15.941
Mom, where can I go to the bathroom?

642
00:51:16.692 --> 00:51:18.652
Find a bush, Audrey.

643
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.574
Dad, you must've jumped this thing
about 50 yards.

644
00:51:23.741 --> 00:51:26.744
It's nothing to be proud of, Rusty.

645
00:51:27.203 --> 00:51:29.246
Fifty yards. Heh.

646
00:51:29.413 --> 00:51:33.542
Ellen! Ellen, get me out of here.

647
00:51:33.709 --> 00:51:36.128
Stay in the car.
It's hot and dangerous out here.

648
00:51:36.295 --> 00:51:39.465
Don't you tell me what to do.
I'll do what I want.

649
00:51:39.632 --> 00:51:42.218
I should never have come
on this trip with you.

650
00:51:42.384 --> 00:51:43.928
I should have taken an airplane.

651
00:51:44.094 --> 00:51:47.890
And he-- He shouldn't even have a license
to drive an automobile.

652
00:51:48.057 --> 00:51:51.393
He should be behind bars.

653
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.022
Sit down and shut up.

654
00:52:01.278 --> 00:52:04.698
Move out of that seat,
and I'll split your lip.

655
00:52:12.122 --> 00:52:14.500
Rusty, come on up here.

656
00:52:14.667 --> 00:52:16.585
Hello, Russ.

657
00:52:16.752 --> 00:52:19.463
I'm gonna hike down the road
to find a service station.

658
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.925
I want you to stay here
and take care of things.

659
00:52:23.092 --> 00:52:26.929
- You'll be okay, Dad?
- Oh, sure, sure, sure.

660
00:52:27.763 --> 00:52:31.225
You know, I haven't had much of a chance
to talk to you man to man, Russ.

661
00:52:31.392 --> 00:52:33.143
Well, I've only been a man
a few days, Dad.

662
00:52:35.938 --> 00:52:38.691
You're growing up so damn fast.

663
00:52:39.066 --> 00:52:41.193
I've spent the last 15 years of my life...

664
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:45.072
...developing newer
and better food additives.

665
00:52:45.364 --> 00:52:48.033
I guess I've missed an awful lot.

666
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.413
At first,
I didn't want to take this vacation.

667
00:52:53.038 --> 00:52:55.082
But now I'm glad I did.

668
00:52:55.249 --> 00:52:58.794
It's given me a chance
to spend a lot more time with you and...

669
00:52:58.961 --> 00:53:01.463
- Audrey.
- Audrey. Yeah.

670
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:06.343
You know, it's been real fun for me,
too, Dad. Really.

671
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.679
Except for Aunt Edna.

672
00:53:08.846 --> 00:53:11.181
Oh, she doesn't mean
to be a pain in the rump.

673
00:53:11.348 --> 00:53:13.142
It's just the way she is.

674
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:16.562
- Let's not let it spoil our fun.
- I won't.

675
00:53:16.729 --> 00:53:19.899
You know, maybe she'd be nicer
if she had a family of her own.

676
00:53:20.065 --> 00:53:24.278
You know, instead of always
having to glom onto someone else's.

677
00:53:25.905 --> 00:53:28.115
You're a pretty bright little guy.

678
00:53:28.282 --> 00:53:30.117
Excuse me. Man.

679
00:53:35.247 --> 00:53:36.790
It's okay, Dad.

680
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.252
You know what I wanna do?

681
00:53:42.338 --> 00:53:45.466
When I was your age,
my dad shared a beer with me...

682
00:53:45.633 --> 00:53:48.093
...and I thought it was
the best thing in the world.

683
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:03.192
When I was a boy, just about
every summer we'd take a vacation.

684
00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:06.236
And you know, in 18 years...

685
00:54:06.528 --> 00:54:08.322
...we never had fun.

686
00:54:10.616 --> 00:54:12.284
But now I have my own family.

687
00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:13.869
And we're on our own vacation.

688
00:54:14.036 --> 00:54:16.664
- And you know something, Russ?
- What, Dad?

689
00:54:17.873 --> 00:54:20.042
We're gonna have fun.

690
00:54:24.505 --> 00:54:25.547
We're gonna have fun.

691
00:54:27.257 --> 00:54:32.262
Hey. Don't let your mother smell beer
on your breath. She'll take it out on me.

692
00:54:33.555 --> 00:54:37.476
Well, I better get a move on if I want
to get us out of here by dark.

693
00:54:39.937 --> 00:54:41.146
Good talk, son.

694
00:54:41.313 --> 00:54:43.065
Good talk, Dad.

695
00:54:43.732 --> 00:54:45.401
Clark?

696
00:54:50.406 --> 00:54:54.118
I just had a good talk with Rusty.
You'll be in good hands here, honey.

697
00:54:55.786 --> 00:54:57.454
Where are you going?

698
00:54:57.621 --> 00:55:01.250
There's gotta be a phone or a gas station
around here somewhere, honey.

699
00:55:02.209 --> 00:55:05.212
All right, but if you're not back
in an hour...

700
00:55:05.379 --> 00:55:08.382
I'll be fine. You'll be fine.
I'm sure this happens all the time.

701
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:10.843
A patrol car will be by any minute.

702
00:55:47.087 --> 00:55:51.592
We pass a goddamn gas station
every 100 yards for 1,000 miles.

703
00:55:51.759 --> 00:55:54.803
But when you really need one,
you end up walking your ass off.

704
00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.473
This is no way to run a desert.

705
00:55:57.639 --> 00:56:00.684
Jesus. I'm gonna die. That's it! I'm dying.

706
00:56:01.477 --> 00:56:03.562
What an asshole.

707
00:56:08.567 --> 00:56:10.903
Taxi. Taxi? Taxi!

708
00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:12.529
Dead. I'm dead.

709
00:56:12.696 --> 00:56:15.866
Taxi! Here boy.

710
00:56:16.116 --> 00:56:19.995
Heat. The heat.
I'm dying. I'm dead. I'm finished.

711
00:56:22.414 --> 00:56:23.874
Hot. Hot.

712
00:56:32.257 --> 00:56:34.093
Hot wrist.

713
00:56:41.517 --> 00:56:43.685
Mom, Mommy?

714
00:56:52.152 --> 00:56:54.154
I'm not sure of his exact height
and weight.

715
00:56:54.321 --> 00:56:56.573
All I know is the man
was a saint with children...

716
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.534
...and a genius with food additives...

717
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.702
...and he was-- Clark!

718
00:57:00.869 --> 00:57:02.079
Ellen!

719
00:57:04.164 --> 00:57:05.999
- I was so worried.
- Russ.

720
00:57:06.166 --> 00:57:08.127
- What are you doing?
- Russ, Russ!

721
00:57:08.293 --> 00:57:11.046
Audrey? Audrey.

722
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.549
Have you grown?

723
00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:16.051
- Are you all right?
- I feel fine.

724
00:57:16.218 --> 00:57:17.970
What happened? How did you get here?

725
00:57:18.137 --> 00:57:21.348
Well, these two nice Indians
and a man on a camel called a tow truck.

726
00:57:21.515 --> 00:57:23.851
- Daddy's back.
- A camel?

727
00:57:24.017 --> 00:57:26.395
A camel. Hey, kids, are you thirsty?

728
00:57:26.562 --> 00:57:29.648
- Yeah, I bet you are, too.
- You said it.

729
00:57:49.293 --> 00:57:52.588
Okay. What do I owe you?

730
00:57:52.838 --> 00:57:56.175
Never heard of no one so shit-all stupid
as you driving off that road.

731
00:57:56.341 --> 00:57:59.261
You must have got
manure for your brains.

732
00:57:59.428 --> 00:58:02.055
Yes, well, I'm from out of town.

733
00:58:02.222 --> 00:58:03.932
What's the bill?

734
00:58:08.437 --> 00:58:09.813
Come on, come on. How much?

735
00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:11.273
How much you got?

736
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.901
No, I'm asking how much the repairs are.

737
00:58:14.067 --> 00:58:17.112
And I'm asking you, how much you got?

738
00:58:18.739 --> 00:58:20.490
You're out of your mind.

739
00:58:20.949 --> 00:58:23.327
I don't have time to play around.
How much is it?

740
00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:26.079
All of it, boy.

741
00:58:27.664 --> 00:58:29.666
What does your sheriff think
of your business practices?

742
00:58:52.356 --> 00:58:55.150
Audrey, honey, how much
babysitting money do you have?

743
00:58:55.317 --> 00:58:57.486
- How come?
- How much?

744
00:58:57.653 --> 00:58:58.737
What's the matter?

745
00:58:58.904 --> 00:59:03.408
Nothing. I just spent $500
on four bald tires and a tow.

746
00:59:03.575 --> 00:59:04.952
How much do you have, Audrey?

747
00:59:06.453 --> 00:59:09.248
- Thirty-five.
- She has $40, Dad.

748
00:59:09.414 --> 00:59:12.125
How would you know
unless you went in my purse, you sneak?

749
00:59:12.292 --> 00:59:14.795
Have you been going through
her private property?

750
00:59:14.962 --> 00:59:17.339
I don't give a frog's fat ass
who went through what.

751
00:59:17.506 --> 00:59:19.174
We need money.

752
00:59:20.175 --> 00:59:22.135
Edna, how much do you have?

753
00:59:22.302 --> 00:59:24.012
She's asleep, Clark.

754
00:59:24.763 --> 00:59:26.932
Russ, wanna look through Edna's purse?

755
00:59:27.099 --> 00:59:28.892
Clark.

756
00:59:34.314 --> 00:59:35.857
Unzip it, Russ.

757
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:42.489
- She has 11 cents, Dad.
- Terrific.

758
00:59:42.656 --> 00:59:45.200
The motel will cash your check.

759
00:59:45.367 --> 00:59:47.327
They better. We're gonna run out of gas.

760
00:59:52.082 --> 00:59:55.836
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't accept this credit card.

761
00:59:56.003 --> 00:59:59.047
- Why not?
- The computer says it's been reported lost.

762
00:59:59.214 --> 01:00:03.552
Oh, no. You see, my wife lost her cards
in Colorado and I had to report it.

763
01:00:03.719 --> 01:00:06.555
The computer is probably saying
I lost mine, which I haven't.

764
01:00:06.722 --> 01:00:09.808
Well, you'll have to straighten
that out with your bank.

765
01:00:10.642 --> 01:00:13.270
- Would you take a personal check?
- For how much?

766
01:00:13.437 --> 01:00:15.981
- Three-hundred dollars.
- I can't do that, sir.

767
01:00:16.148 --> 01:00:18.734
I've lost all my cash.
We're on our way to California.

768
01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.112
- Walley World?
- Yeah. Walley World.

769
01:00:22.279 --> 01:00:24.990
And I'm sort of stuck between a rock
and a hard place.

770
01:00:25.157 --> 01:00:29.244
- You know, I'd really appreciate it.
- Not without a major credit card.

771
01:00:31.705 --> 01:00:34.249
I have $6.13 to my name...

772
01:00:34.416 --> 01:00:37.085
...so I can see we're gonna
have to work something out.

773
01:00:37.252 --> 01:00:39.504
I've already told you
I can't accept a check...

774
01:00:39.671 --> 01:00:41.298
...without a major credit card.

775
01:00:41.465 --> 01:00:43.508
I'm making this out for $1,000.

776
01:00:43.675 --> 01:00:48.430
All you have to do is give me $300 in cash,
and keep $700...

777
01:00:48.597 --> 01:00:52.100
...all for doing nothing more
than acting like a total creep.

778
01:00:53.435 --> 01:00:54.936
The only thing I can do...

779
01:00:55.103 --> 01:00:58.065
...is have you stay here
until the check clears.

780
01:00:58.231 --> 01:01:00.692
Ten working days.

781
01:01:27.427 --> 01:01:30.430
Okay, let's go, come on. Ha-ha.
Where is Edna?

782
01:01:30.597 --> 01:01:33.016
- She's in the car.
- Good. Come on, get in the car.

783
01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:36.186
Don't you want to look
at the Grand Canyon?

784
01:01:37.604 --> 01:01:39.689
Great, let's go.

785
01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:51.743
Rusty, up and at them.

786
01:01:52.786 --> 01:01:54.037
What?

787
01:01:54.204 --> 01:01:56.957
Crack open those sandwiches
I got at the gas station.

788
01:01:57.124 --> 01:02:00.460
I'm so hungry, I could eat a sandwich
from a gas station. Ha-ha-ha.

789
01:02:01.586 --> 01:02:03.338
There's one for everyone.

790
01:02:03.505 --> 01:02:07.467
Audrey, wake up Aunt Edna.
It's time for her to eat and take her pill.

791
01:02:07.634 --> 01:02:10.137
Please, get off me.

792
01:02:10.303 --> 01:02:12.597
Mom, tell Audrey to quit pushing
Aunt Edna on me.

793
01:02:12.764 --> 01:02:15.058
I'm sick of her lying on me all the time.

794
01:02:15.517 --> 01:02:17.519
Be quiet.

795
01:02:18.019 --> 01:02:21.148
- Auntie?
- Honey, it's only a few hours to Phoenix.

796
01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:24.234
- Let her be, she's fine.
- She's not fine.

797
01:02:24.943 --> 01:02:26.611
She's fine. Don't be silly.

798
01:02:26.778 --> 01:02:29.239
She's not fine, Clark.

799
01:02:29.406 --> 01:02:30.615
She's dead.

800
01:02:38.832 --> 01:02:41.042
She breathed on me.
A dead person breathed on me.

801
01:02:41.209 --> 01:02:43.795
Her hand touched me.
She's stiff already. Ugh.

802
01:02:55.432 --> 01:02:57.058
Goddamn it, anyway.

803
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:10.238
She must have passed away
somewhere near Flagstaff.

804
01:03:11.531 --> 01:03:14.117
What are we going to do, Clark?

805
01:03:16.578 --> 01:03:18.914
We could leave her here.
The first phone we pass...

806
01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:21.750
...we could call your cousin
and he could come and get her.

807
01:03:21.917 --> 01:03:23.627
That's the meanest, coldest--

808
01:03:23.793 --> 01:03:26.004
What do you want me to do,
call Federal Express?

809
01:03:26.171 --> 01:03:28.673
We don't have to ride
with a dead person, do we?

810
01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.217
Please say we don't.

811
01:03:30.383 --> 01:03:32.594
It'd be real easy for Cousin Normie
to find her.

812
01:03:32.761 --> 01:03:35.222
All he'd have to do
is look for the buzzards.

813
01:03:35.388 --> 01:03:38.808
Hell. We'll drive her to Cousin Normie's,
for Pete's sake.

814
01:03:38.975 --> 01:03:42.604
I just didn't want to get caught up
in a funeral, inquests and all that crap.

815
01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:48.068
You are the most self-centered,
egotistical, manipulative--

816
01:03:48.235 --> 01:03:50.612
Don't say anything you'll regret, Ellen.

817
01:03:50.779 --> 01:03:53.198
I'm being practical.
If we drove straight through...

818
01:03:53.365 --> 01:03:56.409
...we'd have three days
at Walley World at best. Three.

819
01:03:58.995 --> 01:04:01.456
She can't weigh more than 100 pounds.

820
01:04:01.706 --> 01:04:04.668
Oh, no. You can't put her up on that roof.

821
01:04:04.834 --> 01:04:06.044
Yes, he can.

822
01:04:06.211 --> 01:04:10.131
You want me to strap her to the hood?
What's the difference? She'll be fine.

823
01:04:10.298 --> 01:04:12.801
It's not as if it's going to rain
or something.

824
01:04:39.286 --> 01:04:43.039
This is terrible. Ugh.

825
01:04:43.206 --> 01:04:45.625
What a nightmare.

826
01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:03.852
Don't just blurt it out about Edna dying.

827
01:05:04.019 --> 01:05:06.688
How about if I ask him
to play twenty questions?

828
01:05:14.779 --> 01:05:16.811
Oh, for Christ's sake,
he isn't even home.

829
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.992
Maybe the neighbors
know where he is.

830
01:05:19.159 --> 01:05:23.038
- Moron knows we're coming and isn't home.
- Normie's always been flighty.

831
01:05:23.204 --> 01:05:25.749
- He's always been a jag-off.
- Will you watch your mouth?

832
01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:27.375
There's a note.

833
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:31.630
"Have gone to Flagstaff.
Be back on Monday."

834
01:05:32.255 --> 01:05:33.923
Jeez, what a worm.

835
01:05:52.484 --> 01:05:57.572
Oh-- Darn, it's locked.

836
01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:03.495
Okay, let's go.

837
01:06:04.162 --> 01:06:06.373
We can't leave her on the patio.

838
01:06:07.248 --> 01:06:10.752
You rather I slip her in the night-deposit
box at the funeral home? Come on.

839
01:06:10.919 --> 01:06:13.254
It's raining all over her.

840
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:16.091
She can't catch a cold now, Mom.

841
01:06:16.925 --> 01:06:19.678
Clark, we have to at least say something.

842
01:06:19.844 --> 01:06:22.639
Okay, bow your heads, bow your heads.

843
01:06:23.264 --> 01:06:24.849
Oh, God.

844
01:06:26.059 --> 01:06:29.020
Ease our suffering in this,
our moment of great despair.

845
01:06:29.187 --> 01:06:33.983
Yea, admit this good and decent woman
into thine arms and the flock...

846
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.236
...in thine heavenly area up there.

847
01:06:38.113 --> 01:06:42.033
And Moab he laidest down
behind the land of the Canaanites.

848
01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.829
And, yea, though the Hindus speak
of karma--

849
01:06:45.995 --> 01:06:48.164
- Clark.
- I implore you...

850
01:06:48.331 --> 01:06:50.875
- ...give her a break.
- Clark.

851
01:06:57.132 --> 01:06:59.968
Clark, this is a serious matter.
I'll do it myself.

852
01:07:00.135 --> 01:07:04.347
Honey, I'm not an ordained minister.
I'm doing my best, okay?

853
01:07:04.848 --> 01:07:08.476
Lord, we love this woman
with all our hearts.

854
01:07:08.643 --> 01:07:11.479
- Let's not overdo it, Mom.
- Shut up.

855
01:07:11.646 --> 01:07:14.107
We know she deserves better than this...

856
01:07:14.274 --> 01:07:18.403
...but my husband wants his beloved family
to get to Walley World...

857
01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.155
...to have their vacation.

858
01:07:20.321 --> 01:07:23.283
I hope you understand.
Have mercy on his soul.

859
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:25.744
Amen. Let's go. Come on.

860
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:28.955
I hope you kids have learned
something about life and death.

861
01:07:29.122 --> 01:07:32.292
Yeah. Don't die unless somebody's home.

862
01:07:34.002 --> 01:07:37.338
Normie will understand when he sees
the note we pinned on Edna's sleeve.

863
01:07:37.505 --> 01:07:41.509
Sure. You left his dead mother
tied to a lawn chair in his backyard.

864
01:07:41.676 --> 01:07:43.762
I'm sure he won't mind.

865
01:07:43.928 --> 01:07:45.847
Look, it's all over and done with.

866
01:07:46.014 --> 01:07:49.267
We'll find a place to stay and start fresh
in the morning. It's fine.

867
01:07:49.434 --> 01:07:52.228
I don't want to be in the car anymore.
I want to go home.

868
01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:54.189
I don't want to go to Walley World.

869
01:07:54.355 --> 01:07:58.067
Clark, under the circumstances,
I wouldn't mind if we just went home.

870
01:07:58.234 --> 01:08:00.945
In retrospect, it seems like
a pretty bad idea driving out.

871
01:08:01.112 --> 01:08:03.156
It's been one disaster after another.

872
01:08:03.323 --> 01:08:06.201
Yeah, it's been a real drag, Dad.

873
01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:08.536
Maybe we can try it some other time.

874
01:08:08.703 --> 01:08:12.707
- Walley World's overrated anyway.
- What do you think?

875
01:08:12.874 --> 01:08:14.793
[TIRES SQUEAL

876
01:08:16.461 --> 01:08:18.546
I think you're all fucked in the head.

877
01:08:18.713 --> 01:08:22.258
We're ten hours from the fucking
fun park and you want to bail out.

878
01:08:22.425 --> 01:08:25.220
Well, I'll tell you something.
This is no longer a vacation.

879
01:08:25.386 --> 01:08:27.847
It's a quest. It's a quest for fun.

880
01:08:28.598 --> 01:08:30.683
I'm gonna have fun
and you're gonna have fun.

881
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:32.811
We're all gonna have
so much fucking fun...

882
01:08:32.977 --> 01:08:35.855
...we'll need plastic surgery
to remove our goddamn smiles.

883
01:08:36.022 --> 01:08:39.484
You'll be whistling "zippity-doo-dah"
out of your assholes.

884
01:08:40.944 --> 01:08:43.988
I gotta be crazy. I'm on a pilgrimage
to see a moose.

885
01:08:44.155 --> 01:08:47.992
Praise Marty Moose. Holy shit.

886
01:08:48.993 --> 01:08:50.912
Dad, do you want
an aspirin or something?

887
01:08:51.746 --> 01:08:52.914
Don't touch.

888
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.430
Next time you have
one of your outbursts...

889
01:09:09.597 --> 01:09:12.600
...I'd appreciate if you'd have
some consideration for your kids.

890
01:09:12.767 --> 01:09:15.019
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know?

891
01:09:15.186 --> 01:09:18.356
All I know is I'm trying to treat my family
to a little fun.

892
01:09:18.523 --> 01:09:20.942
Spare me, Clark.
I know your brand of family fun.

893
01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:24.320
Tomorrow you'll probably
kill the desk clerk, hold up a McDonald's...

894
01:09:24.487 --> 01:09:28.741
...and drive us a thousand miles out of the
way to see the world's largest ball of mud.

895
01:09:28.908 --> 01:09:31.202
You know what your problem is, Ellen?

896
01:09:32.453 --> 01:09:36.332
You have a knack for looking at the
dark side of things. That's your problem.

897
01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:40.086
You wouldn't know a good time
if it bit you.

898
01:09:40.253 --> 01:09:43.131
- Where are you going?
- What do you care?

899
01:11:14.263 --> 01:11:16.599
Waiting for someone?

900
01:11:17.433 --> 01:11:20.770
No. Ahem.
Do you mind if I sit down?

901
01:11:22.605 --> 01:11:24.524
Fancy seeing you here.

902
01:11:25.066 --> 01:11:27.860
Having a nice little family vacation?

903
01:11:30.446 --> 01:11:32.991
Oh. No.

904
01:11:33.157 --> 01:11:35.994
It would appear so, wouldn't it? No, no.

905
01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:39.789
No, the truth of it is,
and this is highly confidential...

906
01:11:40.248 --> 01:11:42.333
...I own this motel.

907
01:11:43.334 --> 01:11:47.338
Own the whole chain, nationwide.
Twenty-two hundred units.

908
01:11:48.548 --> 01:11:52.135
Yeah, once a year,
I travel across the country, incognito.

909
01:11:52.301 --> 01:11:54.846
Check things out,
and see how the operation is running.

910
01:11:55.013 --> 01:11:57.557
I thought you were gonna say
you worked for the CIA.

911
01:12:00.393 --> 01:12:03.021
- That's an old bit, huh?
- Really.

912
01:12:03.187 --> 01:12:06.065
Oh, no. No, I'm not with the CIA.

913
01:12:06.232 --> 01:12:09.110
I was, but that was a long time ago.

914
01:12:09.277 --> 01:12:11.863
I don't like to talk about it, really.

915
01:12:12.238 --> 01:12:15.491
No, I'm mostly interested
in my motels now.

916
01:12:15.658 --> 01:12:18.369
- And my airline.
- That's great.

917
01:12:18.536 --> 01:12:20.788
I'm just trying to have a little fun.

918
01:12:20.955 --> 01:12:23.124
It's too bad you're married.

919
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:25.251
I'm in the mood for some fun.

920
01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.378
Married?

921
01:12:27.545 --> 01:12:30.131
Oh, you mean those people I'm with?

922
01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:32.383
That's my brother's family.

923
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:34.052
My brother's ring.

924
01:12:34.218 --> 01:12:38.056
I usually borrow them on
these little inspection tours of mine.

925
01:12:38.806 --> 01:12:42.852
It sort of helps to complete the disguise.
It's fun for them.

926
01:12:43.019 --> 01:12:46.355
It's a good disguise.
I like the station-wagon effect.

927
01:12:46.522 --> 01:12:49.567
Yeah? Well, that's a big part of it.

928
01:12:49.734 --> 01:12:54.781
You know, in order to be convincing, you
have to look and act like an ordinary jerk.

929
01:12:56.574 --> 01:13:00.828
You know, stop at all the stupid sites
and look like a fool.

930
01:13:01.454 --> 01:13:03.748
Basically, be yourself?

931
01:13:03.915 --> 01:13:05.500
Yeah.

932
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.127
You like the disguise?

933
01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:16.511
Yeah, my credo is,
if you have to have a credo...

934
01:13:16.677 --> 01:13:19.388
...you know, "Go for it," pretty much.

935
01:13:19.555 --> 01:13:23.893
You only go around this crazy
merry-go-round once. You know?

936
01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.729
- I agree.
- Yeah.

937
01:13:31.692 --> 01:13:33.820
Yeah, that's my credo.

938
01:13:37.532 --> 01:13:40.451
You don't have to have a credo, but...

939
01:13:40.618 --> 01:13:41.911
If the fur fits, wear it.

940
01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:45.581
A penny saved, pennies from heaven.

941
01:13:45.748 --> 01:13:49.502
My favorite credo, oh, ha-ha...

942
01:13:52.588 --> 01:13:56.634
...um, you know, a penny saved, and...

943
01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:58.302
Thank you.

944
01:14:02.765 --> 01:14:05.226
Wow. This feels great.

945
01:14:07.645 --> 01:14:08.938
Well...

946
01:14:09.105 --> 01:14:11.065
...are you gonna go for it?

947
01:14:11.899 --> 01:14:13.484
Uh-- Here?

948
01:14:13.651 --> 01:14:15.611
For starters, sure.

949
01:14:15.778 --> 01:14:18.781
Why not? Don't you swim?

950
01:14:18.948 --> 01:14:20.741
Oh, sure. Ha-ha.

951
01:14:20.908 --> 01:14:25.997
Sure, I took third in the state finals
in my senior year.

952
01:14:26.372 --> 01:14:28.958
Yeah, I swim. Heck, yes.

953
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:32.378
Oh, yeah, I feel completely at ease
in the water.

954
01:14:32.545 --> 01:14:34.922
Yeah, I...

955
01:14:35.089 --> 01:14:37.049
I'm proficient in many strokes and I dive.

956
01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:40.178
As a matter of fact,
I could've been in the Olympics.

957
01:14:40.928 --> 01:14:45.308
Yeah, uh... Yeah, I'll be right there.

958
01:14:46.017 --> 01:14:47.476
Yeah.

959
01:14:48.603 --> 01:14:51.522
This is crazy, this is crazy,
this is crazy.

960
01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:55.902
- How's the water?
- Exhilarating.

961
01:14:56.986 --> 01:15:00.156
I'm in deep, I'm in deep.

962
01:15:04.327 --> 01:15:06.162
Ah! Cold!

963
01:15:06.329 --> 01:15:09.373
Jesus. Fuck. Ah!

964
01:15:10.082 --> 01:15:11.626
Clark?

965
01:15:11.792 --> 01:15:13.044
Cold!

966
01:15:14.003 --> 01:15:15.588
Jesus! Ah!

967
01:15:23.596 --> 01:15:25.264
Clark?

968
01:15:25.848 --> 01:15:28.351
- Hi, honey.
- What are you doing?

969
01:15:28.517 --> 01:15:29.685
Uh-- Swimming.

970
01:15:29.852 --> 01:15:33.147
Yeah, my back was killing me.

971
01:15:33.314 --> 01:15:37.193
I thought, you know, a good hot swim
would loosen up the muscles.

972
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.488
Why go to the car and get
the bathing suit? Jump right in.

973
01:15:41.197 --> 01:15:43.032
It's exhilarating.

974
01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:47.245
Guess what, honey?
This person here was here.

975
01:15:47.662 --> 01:15:49.789
I didn't see this person...

976
01:15:49.956 --> 01:15:53.501
...so I screamed, that's why I yelled.
I was so surprised.

977
01:15:53.668 --> 01:15:56.170
You can imagine, can't you, honey?

978
01:16:00.132 --> 01:16:01.175
Honey?

979
01:16:14.355 --> 01:16:16.190
Will you excuse me?

980
01:16:16.357 --> 01:16:17.566
If you have to go.

981
01:16:18.985 --> 01:16:21.779
Well, I'd stay if I weren't married,
but I am.

982
01:16:21.946 --> 01:16:23.531
I know.

983
01:16:24.031 --> 01:16:28.536
- I hope I didn't spoil your evening.
- No, it's been interesting.

984
01:16:29.412 --> 01:16:31.372
Well, enjoy the rest of your trip.

985
01:16:31.539 --> 01:16:33.165
You, too.

986
01:16:41.882 --> 01:16:44.218
I can't believe this.

987
01:16:44.969 --> 01:16:48.431
I am so humiliated.

988
01:16:50.057 --> 01:16:52.560
Cut it out, Audrey. You don't even know
how to inhale.

989
01:16:52.727 --> 01:16:54.186
So?

990
01:16:54.353 --> 01:16:56.480
Maybe I don't want to.

991
01:16:56.647 --> 01:16:59.025
You're such a dork, Audrey.

992
01:17:00.067 --> 01:17:02.695
How can he do this to Mom?

993
01:17:03.237 --> 01:17:05.448
They'll probably get a divorce.

994
01:17:05.614 --> 01:17:07.116
I'd better go talk to him.

995
01:17:11.996 --> 01:17:14.081
- Hey, squirt.
- Hey, Dad.

996
01:17:14.248 --> 01:17:15.333
What are you doing up?

997
01:17:16.584 --> 01:17:18.461
You woke the whole motel up, Dad.

998
01:17:21.505 --> 01:17:23.215
I was swimming.

999
01:17:23.382 --> 01:17:24.633
Yeah, I saw you.

1000
01:17:26.761 --> 01:17:28.596
Russ, come here a minute.

1001
01:17:31.474 --> 01:17:32.641
Russ...

1002
01:17:32.808 --> 01:17:35.686
...you know I wouldn't do anything
to hurt your mom.

1003
01:17:37.104 --> 01:17:39.607
It's been a long drive...

1004
01:17:40.608 --> 01:17:41.942
...and, jeez, I work...

1005
01:17:42.109 --> 01:17:46.280
I work very hard for you
and Audrey and your mom.

1006
01:17:48.699 --> 01:17:52.870
I guess when you get older
you get these feelings...

1007
01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:57.750
...and these feelings make you do things
you wouldn't normally do.

1008
01:17:58.209 --> 01:18:01.712
- Like swimming naked with girls?
- Yeah. Like swimming naked with girls.

1009
01:18:01.879 --> 01:18:04.632
Well, not with girls.
You think I was swimming with girls?

1010
01:18:04.799 --> 01:18:07.760
It was just one girl. I saw that girl.

1011
01:18:07.927 --> 01:18:09.178
Who, that girl?

1012
01:18:09.345 --> 01:18:12.139
Oh, no, that's a waitress.
No, I was just ordering in.

1013
01:18:12.306 --> 01:18:14.975
She's a pool waitress. I was...

1014
01:18:15.142 --> 01:18:18.562
...ordering some fish for you
and Audrey and Mom.

1015
01:18:18.729 --> 01:18:22.149
- She took your order?
- She took my order, yeah. Ha-ha.

1016
01:18:22.316 --> 01:18:24.360
Swimming waitress.

1017
01:18:24.527 --> 01:18:26.153
You understand, don't you, Russ?

1018
01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.323
Sure, I understand.

1019
01:18:29.657 --> 01:18:31.742
Do you think Mom will buy it?

1020
01:18:33.828 --> 01:18:35.788
Good talk, son.

1021
01:18:36.914 --> 01:18:38.791
Go to bed, Russ.

1022
01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:40.668
Goodnight.

1023
01:18:44.713 --> 01:18:46.215
Ellen?

1024
01:18:49.844 --> 01:18:51.345
Ellen?

1025
01:18:51.595 --> 01:18:53.139
Honey?

1026
01:18:55.599 --> 01:18:57.226
Are you mad?

1027
01:18:58.102 --> 01:18:59.854
No.

1028
01:19:01.355 --> 01:19:03.524
Do you like that girl?

1029
01:19:04.442 --> 01:19:06.360
Is that what you want?

1030
01:19:06.527 --> 01:19:09.738
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1031
01:19:09.905 --> 01:19:12.158
How could I like a girl like that?

1032
01:19:12.324 --> 01:19:14.201
She's ugly.

1033
01:19:15.077 --> 01:19:16.871
I love you.

1034
01:19:19.623 --> 01:19:22.251
I'm sorry about everything.

1035
01:19:22.418 --> 01:19:24.712
I got angry because you were right
and I knew it.

1036
01:19:24.879 --> 01:19:26.714
I was hurt, honey.

1037
01:19:26.881 --> 01:19:29.800
I'm sorry, too. It's not all your fault.

1038
01:19:29.967 --> 01:19:31.760
I know you've been trying.

1039
01:19:31.927 --> 01:19:34.221
I'm gonna try, too.

1040
01:19:35.973 --> 01:19:38.058
I know how to have fun.

1041
01:19:38.893 --> 01:19:40.728
And I'm going to prove it.

1042
01:19:41.479 --> 01:19:44.190
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Ellen? What are we doing?

1043
01:19:44.356 --> 01:19:46.734
Honey, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

1044
01:19:46.901 --> 01:19:50.529
Come on, Clark.
I want us to have some fun together.

1045
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:54.575
- Come on.
- The water's very--

1046
01:19:55.242 --> 01:19:57.161
Fuck! Aah!

1047
01:20:28.108 --> 01:20:30.361
We must be getting close.

1048
01:20:30.528 --> 01:20:32.947
We're almost there.
Everybody just take it easy.

1049
01:20:33.113 --> 01:20:36.575
Just take it easy. We're gonna be there.

1050
01:20:38.953 --> 01:20:42.748
I know we're getting close.
What is that? What is that?

1051
01:20:42.915 --> 01:20:44.333
There it is.

1052
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.001
Walley World, next three exits.

1053
01:20:46.168 --> 01:20:49.338
- Dad! Whoa!
- Walley World!

1054
01:20:50.673 --> 01:20:53.133
We made it, damn it. We made it.

1055
01:20:54.134 --> 01:20:57.388
The Griswolds are one hell
of a family, huh? We made it!

1056
01:21:00.641 --> 01:21:03.602
Don't get too much sun, now.
Watch out. Watch out.

1057
01:21:08.899 --> 01:21:10.651
It's beautiful.

1058
01:21:10.818 --> 01:21:13.445
It's just beautiful.

1059
01:21:14.488 --> 01:21:16.907
Oh, darling.

1060
01:21:18.909 --> 01:21:23.998
- We made it.
- You did it, Clark. Sparky.

1061
01:21:24.164 --> 01:21:26.667
I love you guys. I love. I love.

1062
01:21:40.306 --> 01:21:42.933
Aah. First ones here. First ones here.

1063
01:21:46.061 --> 01:21:47.896
First ones here.

1064
01:21:48.063 --> 01:21:50.357
But we're so far away, Clark.

1065
01:21:50.524 --> 01:21:53.861
Right, right. And at the end of the day,
when the lot's all full...

1066
01:21:54.028 --> 01:21:57.656
...and everybody's fighting to get out,
we'll be the first ones out, too.

1067
01:21:59.033 --> 01:22:03.370
Why? Because we're the Griswolds.

1068
01:22:05.539 --> 01:22:07.374
Come on, I'll race you.

1069
01:23:18.112 --> 01:23:20.656
<i>Sorry, folks.
We're closed for two weeks...</i>

1070
01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:25.285
<i>...to clean and repair
America's favorite family fun park. Sorry.</i>

1071
01:23:30.332 --> 01:23:31.542
<i>Sorry, folks. We're closed...</i>

1072
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:33.669
Clark. What are you doing?

1073
01:23:33.836 --> 01:23:35.879
We watch his program.

1074
01:23:36.046 --> 01:23:39.133
We buy his toys. We go to his movies.
He owes us.

1075
01:23:39.299 --> 01:23:41.176
Doesn't he owe us, huh?

1076
01:23:41.343 --> 01:23:42.970
He owes the Griswolds, right?

1077
01:23:43.137 --> 01:23:44.805
Fucking A right, he owes us.

1078
01:23:44.972 --> 01:23:47.725
- Clark, you're scaring me.
- Don't be scared.

1079
01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:50.769
I just think somebody owes us
an explanation, that's all.

1080
01:23:50.936 --> 01:23:55.190
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Clark, now just a minute.

1081
01:24:14.251 --> 01:24:16.754
Honey, you wanna check the mileage
for me, please?

1082
01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.548
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1083
01:24:19.715 --> 01:24:21.675
I'm just gonna get some sporting goods.

1084
01:24:23.844 --> 01:24:25.804
Thank you, thank you.

1085
01:24:33.687 --> 01:24:35.647
Clark, will you listen to me?

1086
01:24:35.814 --> 01:24:39.026
Let's just find a hotel. I'll call my parents,
they'll wire us money.

1087
01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:41.695
We can fly home and forget
this vacation ever happened.

1088
01:24:41.862 --> 01:24:45.365
Honey, relax. I told you I'm not angry
anymore. I'm in complete control.

1089
01:24:45.532 --> 01:24:48.368
I'm sure they're not repairing every ride
at the same time.

1090
01:24:48.535 --> 01:24:51.455
I think they owe us a little explanation
and a little fun, okay?

1091
01:24:51.622 --> 01:24:54.708
Whatever happens, just trust me.
Will you just trust me? Huh, kids?

1092
01:25:00.672 --> 01:25:04.343
Sorry, folks, park's closed.
The moose out front should have told you.

1093
01:25:04.510 --> 01:25:08.013
- Yes, we're here to see Mr. Roy Walley.
- What is your name, sir?

1094
01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:10.307
Clark W. Griswold.

1095
01:25:12.893 --> 01:25:14.520
What's this regarding, Mr. Gristle?

1096
01:25:14.686 --> 01:25:18.106
We're here, public relations--
Summer inspection.

1097
01:25:18.273 --> 01:25:20.526
Personal matter. Inspection.

1098
01:25:23.904 --> 01:25:28.075
Well, nobody notified
this office of anything.

1099
01:25:28.242 --> 01:25:30.452
Well, I'm notifying you.

1100
01:25:30.619 --> 01:25:32.746
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
more than that, sir.

1101
01:25:32.913 --> 01:25:34.748
Okey-dokey. How's this?

1102
01:25:36.542 --> 01:25:39.878
Clark, have you lost your mind?
Where did you get that?

1103
01:25:40.045 --> 01:25:42.339
Sporting goods store.
You listen to me, fat ass.

1104
01:25:42.506 --> 01:25:44.758
Do what I say
and there won't be any problem, okay?

1105
01:25:44.925 --> 01:25:49.263
We just drove 2460 miles,
just for a little Roy Walley entertainment.

1106
01:25:49.429 --> 01:25:51.598
The moose says you're closed.
I say you're open.

1107
01:25:51.765 --> 01:25:54.226
We're not really violent people.

1108
01:25:54.393 --> 01:25:56.228
This is our first gun.

1109
01:25:56.395 --> 01:25:58.272
No, it isn't.

1110
01:25:58.730 --> 01:26:01.817
- What's going on here?
- You. Freeze. Freeze.

1111
01:26:01.984 --> 01:26:04.695
Sit! Sit, come on.

1112
01:26:04.862 --> 01:26:07.573
Lie down. Let's go, lie down.

1113
01:26:08.615 --> 01:26:10.075
Roll over.

1114
01:26:10.617 --> 01:26:12.035
Stay.

1115
01:26:13.787 --> 01:26:17.791
Okay. Okay. Let's ride.
Let's ride. Come on.

1116
01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:19.459
Stay.

1117
01:26:23.088 --> 01:26:26.300
Yee-hoo. This is scary, isn't it?

1118
01:26:26.466 --> 01:26:29.636
Make sure you keep your hands
on the handlebars at all times.

1119
01:26:29.803 --> 01:26:32.848
- We don't want any accidents.
- Is that a real gun, Mom?

1120
01:26:33.015 --> 01:26:36.602
I don't know, Rusty.
But when this is all over...

1121
01:26:36.768 --> 01:26:39.396
...your father may be going away
for a little while.

1122
01:26:39.563 --> 01:26:43.150
Boy, I sure am bushed.
Have you had enough yet, sir?

1123
01:26:43.317 --> 01:26:45.193
What do you mean, bushed?

1124
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.154
Where are the big rides? The big ones?

1125
01:26:52.951 --> 01:26:55.412
Screamie Mimi! Let's go. Get in the front.

1126
01:26:55.579 --> 01:26:56.997
Come on.

1127
01:27:01.084 --> 01:27:03.587
Has your father
ever killed anyone before?

1128
01:27:03.754 --> 01:27:06.548
Oh, just a dog. Oh, and my Aunt Edna.

1129
01:27:06.715 --> 01:27:10.052
- Hey. You can't prove that, Rusty.
- Ooh.

1130
01:27:12.054 --> 01:27:14.681
Rusty? May I call you Rusty?

1131
01:27:14.848 --> 01:27:17.601
I had a bad experience
on this ride once before.

1132
01:27:17.768 --> 01:27:19.186
What happened?

1133
01:27:19.353 --> 01:27:20.437
I threw up.

1134
01:27:36.036 --> 01:27:38.121
No, don't do that again.

1135
01:28:47.816 --> 01:28:49.818
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY

1136
01:29:15.552 --> 01:29:18.930
Goodie, goodie, goodie! The Loop-D-Loop.
Come on, get in there. Let's go.

1137
01:29:19.097 --> 01:29:21.308
- Please, don't push.
- Come on, Audrey.

1138
01:29:21.475 --> 01:29:23.560
Isn't this fun, honey? Come on.

1139
01:29:25.604 --> 01:29:28.023
That's not a real gun, is it, Clark?

1140
01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:30.275
What? Are you kidding?
This is a Magnum P.I.

1141
01:29:30.442 --> 01:29:32.027
It's a BB gun.

1142
01:29:32.194 --> 01:29:34.321
Don't try me. I could
put an eye out with this.

1143
01:29:34.488 --> 01:29:37.991
- You couldn't break the skin with that.
- It could. It could break the skin.

1144
01:29:38.158 --> 01:29:40.744
It could lodge under the skin
and cause a bad infection.

1145
01:29:40.911 --> 01:29:44.331
- That's an old wives' tale, Clark. I'm telling.
- You're not going--

1146
01:29:44.498 --> 01:29:46.666
Clark.

1147
01:29:46.833 --> 01:29:48.502
See, I told you. I warned you.

1148
01:29:48.668 --> 01:29:51.004
If you wrecked these pants,
you're paying for them.

1149
01:29:51.171 --> 01:29:54.049
Yeah, I'll pay for them.
You'll pay for them.

1150
01:29:54.758 --> 01:29:57.344
- Why did you shoot me?
- It's a BB gun. I told you.

1151
01:29:57.511 --> 01:29:59.137
- Well it hurt.
- What do you want?

1152
01:29:59.304 --> 01:30:01.306
- Why'd you shoot me?
- You tried to run away.

1153
01:30:01.473 --> 01:30:03.600
- I wasn't going anywhere.
- I thought you were.

1154
01:30:03.767 --> 01:30:05.102
This is great, Dad!

1155
01:31:06.413 --> 01:31:07.706
Freeze!

1156
01:31:11.334 --> 01:31:12.586
Don't shoot.

1157
01:31:13.503 --> 01:31:15.255
You, out.

1158
01:31:15.422 --> 01:31:18.258
All right, hands behind your heads.

1159
01:31:18.425 --> 01:31:20.468
Spread your legs apart.

1160
01:31:20.635 --> 01:31:23.889
And up against the wall.
You two, over there.

1161
01:31:27.058 --> 01:31:29.853
- Just a BB gun.
- You're all under arrest.

1162
01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:32.105
You have the right to remain silent.

1163
01:31:32.272 --> 01:31:35.817
- If you give up the right to remain silent--
- Watch your hands, mister.

1164
01:31:35.984 --> 01:31:37.944
--in a court of law.

1165
01:31:42.407 --> 01:31:45.702
How many are there? A lot of them?
What, five? What, are they Arabs?

1166
01:31:45.869 --> 01:31:48.163
Whatever they want, pay them.
We'll pay them.

1167
01:31:48.330 --> 01:31:50.457
- What's going on?
- We've got it under control.

1168
01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:52.292
- These people are terrorists.
- Where?

1169
01:31:52.459 --> 01:31:53.668
- There.
- Them?

1170
01:31:53.835 --> 01:31:56.588
- Hello, Mr. Walley.
- He treated me like a dog, Mr. Walley.

1171
01:31:56.755 --> 01:31:59.674
- He humiliated my human decency!
- What did he do with your dog?

1172
01:31:59.841 --> 01:32:02.802
He kidnapped me, but I wanna tell you,
I had a great time.

1173
01:32:02.969 --> 01:32:06.681
It's the most fantastic time I ever had.
I like where I was way up high--

1174
01:32:06.848 --> 01:32:09.184
I'm glad you liked it.
Now, what's happening?

1175
01:32:09.351 --> 01:32:10.977
- That's Roy Walley, honey.
- I know!

1176
01:32:11.144 --> 01:32:12.979
Mr. Walley, my name is Russ Lasky.

1177
01:32:13.146 --> 01:32:15.982
- I met you at the summer picnic last year.
- I don't remember.

1178
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:18.568
- They kidnapped my men.
- I was the one who was sick.

1179
01:32:18.735 --> 01:32:21.821
Anyway, I went on all the rides,
and I didn't get sick this time.

1180
01:32:21.988 --> 01:32:24.741
- Normally, I get sick on all your rides--
- Quiet!

1181
01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:30.413
Uh-- Mr. Walley? Roy?

1182
01:32:30.914 --> 01:32:33.416
I think I can make some sense out of this.

1183
01:32:33.583 --> 01:32:35.835
Well, somebody better explain...

1184
01:32:36.002 --> 01:32:38.672
...or there'll be a lot of explaining to do.

1185
01:32:38.838 --> 01:32:41.633
- I'm Clark W. Griswold.
- Uh-huh.

1186
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.427
And, oh, this is my wife, Ellen.

1187
01:32:44.594 --> 01:32:48.473
Hi. We're really big fans of yours.
We watch your show all the time.

1188
01:32:48.765 --> 01:32:51.309
And my children, Audrey and Rusty.

1189
01:32:52.185 --> 01:32:54.271
- Nice family.
- Heh-heh.

1190
01:32:56.356 --> 01:33:00.110
- We're from Chicago, Roy. The Windy City.
- Yes, I've been there many times.

1191
01:33:00.277 --> 01:33:05.365
We just spent two weeks of living hell
driving out here.

1192
01:33:05.865 --> 01:33:08.827
We lost a very dear member
of the family along the way.

1193
01:33:11.037 --> 01:33:12.539
But the important thing, Roy...

1194
01:33:12.706 --> 01:33:15.750
...is that we could've gone anywhere
we wanted to this summer.

1195
01:33:15.917 --> 01:33:17.502
Anywhere in the world.

1196
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:19.462
But when I asked my kids...

1197
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:24.050
And I said-- Kids, remember when I said,
"Where would you like to go this summer?"

1198
01:33:24.217 --> 01:33:26.052
- What did you say?
- Hawaii?

1199
01:33:26.219 --> 01:33:28.555
Shut up, Russ. Audrey, you remember?

1200
01:33:29.014 --> 01:33:31.224
Uh-- Walley World, Dad?

1201
01:33:31.391 --> 01:33:34.894
Walley World, Dad. Roy Walley World.

1202
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:37.063
I don't imagine you have any children.

1203
01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:39.274
Are you kidding? I have seven.

1204
01:33:39.441 --> 01:33:41.943
I thought so.
Seven, did you hear that, honey?

1205
01:33:42.527 --> 01:33:44.237
You look so young.

1206
01:33:44.779 --> 01:33:46.990
- You do look very young.
- Oh? Well.

1207
01:33:47.157 --> 01:33:48.992
Did you ever drive them across country?

1208
01:33:49.159 --> 01:33:50.368
Oh, hell yes.

1209
01:33:50.535 --> 01:33:54.873
I took the whole clan to Florida one year.
The worst two weeks I ever had in my life.

1210
01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.001
The smell from the back seat
was unbearable. You know families.

1211
01:33:58.168 --> 01:34:00.754
I know that smell. I know that smell.

1212
01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.175
But, Roy, can you imagine
how your kids would've felt...

1213
01:34:05.342 --> 01:34:07.427
...if when you got to Florida,
it was closed?

1214
01:34:07.594 --> 01:34:08.970
Oh, they don't close Florida.

1215
01:34:09.137 --> 01:34:13.183
I know they don't close
the state of Florida. But, you know...

1216
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:15.769
...when we got here,
to Roy Walley World...

1217
01:34:15.935 --> 01:34:18.104
...and it was closed down, Roy...

1218
01:34:18.271 --> 01:34:20.648
If you had seen the look
on my kids' faces...

1219
01:34:20.815 --> 01:34:24.110
- I just went a little haywire.
- You went a lot haywire, if you ask me.

1220
01:34:24.277 --> 01:34:27.113
Well, I'm very sorry, sir.
And I'm sorry to all these people.

1221
01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.491
I didn't mean any harm.

1222
01:34:29.657 --> 01:34:33.244
I just want you to ask yourself one thing.
If you were...

1223
01:34:33.787 --> 01:34:35.080
If you were me...

1224
01:34:35.246 --> 01:34:38.041
...wouldn't you do the same thing
for your children?

1225
01:34:38.208 --> 01:34:40.543
- No.
- We're all finished here, Mr. Walley.

1226
01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:43.338
You want me to take them downtown
and book them?

1227
01:34:47.133 --> 01:34:48.676
No. No.

1228
01:34:48.843 --> 01:34:51.262
Forget it, officer.
I'm not gonna press any charges.

1229
01:34:55.809 --> 01:34:59.312
Walley. Good, huh?
What did I tell you? Did I say trust me?
