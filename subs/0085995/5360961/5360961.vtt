1
00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.744
Clark Griswold.
I'm trading my wife's old car in.

2
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.915
Say goodbye
to the old gas-guzzler, Russ.

3
00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:46.625
See you later.

4
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.335
Pretty exciting, isn't it, Rusty?

5
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.380
- What's that, Dad?
- Picking up the new car.

6
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.341
Yeah, you can't wait, can you?

7
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.760
- Hi there, Ed.
- Good to see you, Mr. Griswold.

8
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.221
- How're you doing? Ruben, right?
- Rusty.

9
00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.264
- Okay.
- Look at him. He can't wait.

10
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.141
So did you bring your trade-in?

11
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:06.061
Yeah, a guy just took it away
a couple of seconds ago.

12
00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:07.646
- Let's get to it, then.
- Okay.

13
00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:10.524
We were afraid the new one
wouldn't come in yet.

14
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.152
On our way to California. The big vacation,
the whole family, Walley World.

15
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.613
- Walley World? Very exciting, Clyde.
- Clark.

16
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.241
Well, there she is.

17
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:20.450
Where?

18
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.369
Right here. The wagon.

19
00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:25.080
Dad, this is not the car you ordered.

20
00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:29.334
Take it easy, Rusty.
Ed, this is not the car I ordered.

21
00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.630
I distinctly ordered
the Antarctic Blue Super Sportswagon...

22
00:03:33.797 --> 00:03:36.299
...with the CB
and the optional Rally fun pack.

23
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.261
You didn't order the Metallic Pea?

24
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.140
Metallic Pea? No, Antarctic Blue.

25
00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.643
The Sportswagon.
This isn't even the right model.

26
00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:49.312
I think you're right.
I don't think this is the car.

27
00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.481
This is the new
Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

28
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.152
This is a damn fine automobile,
if you want my honest opinion.

29
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.154
Beats the hell
out of the Sportswagon.

30
00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.989
But I want to make you happy.

31
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:00.365
Davenport.

32
00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:02.284
I'll get to the bottom of this.

33
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:03.744
Yes, Mr. Ed?

34
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.913
Mr. Griswold ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?

35
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.957
I don't know, sir.

36
00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.045
I know what must have happened.

37
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:15.797
It didn't come in.

38
00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:21.511
Ed, I'm not your ordinary,
everyday fool. Okay?

39
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.931
Now, I'd like my Antarctic Blue
Super Sportswagon right now.

40
00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.685
If you can't get it for me,
I'm gonna take my business elsewhere.

41
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.103
Where's my old car?

42
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.735
I'm just as upset as you are. Believe me.

43
00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.528
Davenport.

44
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:42.115
Get Mr. Griswold's car back.
Bring it back here.

45
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.750
I can get you the wagon, no problem.
The problem is, it might take six weeks.

46
00:04:52.584 --> 00:04:54.711
I owe it to myself
to tell you, Mr. Griswold...

47
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:57.547
...if you're thinking of taking
the tribe cross-country...

48
00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.841
...this is the automobile
you should be using.

49
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:02.010
The Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

50
00:05:02.177 --> 00:05:04.846
You think you hate it now,
but wait until you drive it.

51
00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:08.433
I don't want to drive it.
I just want my old car back, okay?

52
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.729
I'm not falling for this bit.
No way. Let's go, Russ.

53
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.222
Clark, is that the right car?

54
00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.433
No, it isn't, honey. I changed my mind.

55
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.395
They flattened our old car like a pancake.

56
00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.815
Are you serious?
Is this really our car, Dad?

57
00:05:56.982 --> 00:06:00.068
What happened? I thought we were
gonna get the little Sports thing.

58
00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:02.821
Oh, no. The Sportswagon's
much too small.

59
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:05.115
Besides, I got a great deal on this one.

60
00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.910
Let me tell you, if we're taking
the whole tribe across country...

61
00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.663
...believe me, this is your automobile.

62
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:14.749
Why is it still running?

63
00:06:14.916 --> 00:06:16.418
Oh, all new cars do that.

64
00:06:16.585 --> 00:06:18.044
I'll take care of that in a second.

65
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:24.759
You may think you hate it now, honey,
but wait until you drive it.

66
00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.471
Whoa! An air bag.

67
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:31.892
You know, Clark, it's not too late
to fly out to California.

68
00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.310
We only have two weeks.

69
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:36.479
Let's not get into that again,
sweetie pie. Please?

70
00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:40.525
Lots of families fly, Clark.
Especially cross-country.

71
00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:44.654
The whole idea of a family vacation
is to spend time together as a family.

72
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:47.240
You get on an airplane,
you put on your earphones...

73
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.576
...and you're lost in your own world.

74
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.953
It's an awfully long ride, Clark.

75
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.331
I'm looking forward
to an awfully long ride.

76
00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:58.960
You get to see the kids all the time.
I see them two minutes in the morning...

77
00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.547
...two minutes in the evening.
Maybe three hours on the weekend.

78
00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:06.760
Sheesh. One of these days I'm gonna
get up and realize that my little babies...

79
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:08.970
...are all grown up. And then what?

80
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:13.141
I just thought it might be easier to fly.

81
00:07:13.308 --> 00:07:16.519
Nothing worthwhile is easy, Ellen.

82
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.688
We know that.

83
00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:19.981
Kids?

84
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.109
Who wants to see the triptych?

85
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:24.861
What? Dad, we're playing.

86
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:28.865
Okay, shut off the video games.
Come on, Russ. Shut it off.

87
00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:32.243
I know you'll enjoy this.
I worked out the trip on the computer...

88
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.288
...So we get the maximum amount
of fun time at Walley World...

89
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.249
...without missing any of the good stuff
along the way.

90
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:39.960
Here we go. There's us.

91
00:07:40.126 --> 00:07:41.544
And there's Walley World.

92
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.298
Let's just take a look at Day One.
Shall we?

93
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.176
Honey, come on in.
We're gonna do Day One.

94
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:56.726
Okay, now there's the Family Truckster
as we leave Chicago.

95
00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:04.192
Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster.

96
00:08:05.527 --> 00:08:09.364
Russ, do you mind? I'm trying to work
this out here on the computer. Please.

97
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:14.869
Okay, Audrey. Thank you, Audrey.
That's just great.

98
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.831
Look out, Dad, here I come.

99
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:19.582
All right, that's enough, Russ.

100
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:21.793
Okay. Now, I think we're moving towards--

101
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.920
Thank you. Good shot, Audrey.

102
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:26.631
Dad, I forgot. Why aren't we flying?

103
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.593
Why aren't we flying? Because getting there
is half the fun. You know that.

104
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.515
I turned off the water,
the stove, the heat and the air.

105
00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:38.309
Locked the door, notified the police,
stopped the papers.

106
00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:39.894
I called to get the grass cut.

107
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.605
Did I put the timers
on the living-room lights?

108
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.607
Oh, and don't forget the mail.

109
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.277
- Watch that elbow. Keep your arm straight.
- Bye!

110
00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:50.363
- Bye!
- So long.

111
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:54.909
- Drive careful now, Clark.
- Watch out for the Indians, Clark.

112
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.287
Watch those freeways.

113
00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.788
Oh, goodbye.

114
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.749
Oh, I know I've forgotten something.

115
00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.126

Clark, isn't this the gas tank?

Yes, I know, honey.

<i>- No.</i>

165
00:13:01.948 --> 00:13:03.616
Dad, what river is this?

166
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:06.536
That's the Mississippi.
The mighty Mississip.

167
00:13:07.954 --> 00:13:11.791
The Old Miss. The Old Man.

168
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.628
♪ <i>Deep river</i> ♪

169
00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:21.050
♪ <i>My home is over Jordan</i> ♪

170
00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.678
Clark, I think this is the wrong exit.

171
00:13:23.845 --> 00:13:26.889
What's the difference,
as long as we get across the river?

172
00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:39.444
Clark? What are you doing?

173
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.405
- Just relax, Ellen.
- This is so dangerous.

174
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.366
We have no business
being in an area like this.

175
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:46.743
Well, look at it this way.

176
00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.078
This is a part of America
we never get to see.

177
00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:51.247
- That's good.
- No, that's bad.

178
00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:54.667
I mean, we can't close our eyes
to the plight of the cities.

179
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.378
Kids, you noticing all this plight?

180
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.256
This will just make us appreciate
what we have.

181
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.426
Roll them up.

182
00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:13.436
I'd better ask these fellas
how to get back on the expressway.

183
00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:17.482
Pardon me.

184
00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:20.943
I wonder if you could tell me
how to get back on the expressway?

185
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.113
- Fuck your mama.
- Thank you very much.

186
00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:31.204
Hey, Darnell, check out this Truckster.

187
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:32.663
It's a Truckster.

188
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.791
With a luggage rack.

189
00:14:37.293 --> 00:14:40.880
Hey, excuse me, homes? Heh-heh. Aha.

190
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.217
What it is, bro. We're from out of town.

191
00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:45.426
No shit?

192
00:14:45.843 --> 00:14:48.554
I'd really appreciate it
if you could give me directions...

193
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.515
...back onto the expressway.

194
00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.476
- What? For free?
- Sure.

195
00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:55.561
Five dollars.

196
00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:59.399
- I'm not gonna give you $5 for directions.
- I think that's fair, Clark.

197
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:03.611
Okay. Here's $10.

198
00:15:03.778 --> 00:15:05.655
Thank you.

199
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:08.908
Keep the change.

200
00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.328
Okay. Now, you see which way
you're pointing, right?

201
00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:13.996
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, that's good.

202
00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.581
Because, you see that place?

203
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.960
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You see where it say, "Rib Tips"?

204
00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.336
- Rib Tips.
- Mm-hm. Fuck that.

205
00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:22.296
You don't want to go that way.

206
00:15:22.463 --> 00:15:24.424
I wonder if these guys
know the Commodores.

207
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.093
You gonna go all the way down
about half a block...

208
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.846
...and you'll see a Torino
with no wheels on it.

209
00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.932
Inside that Torino is my cousin, Jackie.

210
00:15:33.099 --> 00:15:35.351
You tell him that you're my boy,
and you're lost.

211
00:15:35.518 --> 00:15:37.520
He'll make sure
you get where you're going.

212
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:40.606
You don't want to know from me.
This ain't my neighborhood.

213
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.484
I'm from the west side of Chicago,
here on vacation.

214
00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.195
Thanks a lot. You've been a great help.

215
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.829
- Honey?
- Hmm.

216
00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.666
This reminds me of the time in college...

217
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:01.711
...when we drove down to Fort Lauderdale
in my Austin-Healy.

218
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:05.381
I haven't thought about that
for a long time.

219
00:16:06.674 --> 00:16:08.801
Remember what we did in the car?

220
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:12.180
It's amazing we didn't get in an accident.

221
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:13.973
Want to relive a fond memory?

222
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.017
Are you serious?

223
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:18.436
- No.
- Why not?

224
00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.147
Because, that's why.

225
00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:23.399
The kids are asleep.

226
00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.820
Let's just wait until we get to a motel.

227
00:16:30.156 --> 00:16:34.410
Okay, we'll wait.
I gotta find the best one on the road.

228
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.746
Do you want to put your head in my lap?

229
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:38.915
That's not what I was thinking.

230
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.461
The wheel. Let me get this.

231
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:46.172
There you go, move it out of your way.

232
00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.965
Comfy?

233
00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.427
Clark?

234
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:54.096
Clark, my head's stuck.

235
00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:59.185
Clark, quit kidding around. It hurts.

236
00:16:59.352 --> 00:17:00.811
It's stuck.

237
00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.648
Cut it out.

238
00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:07.902
I know what you're trying to do,
and I think it's sick.

239
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:11.656
The wheel's stuck.

240
00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:15.076
That was a dirty trick.

241
00:17:15.243 --> 00:17:16.911
The damn wheel is all screwed up.

242
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:19.539
You're tired.
You get weird when you get tired.

243
00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.709
Let's just find a motel.
I don't want you dozing off.

244
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.629
I'm not tired. Are you kidding?

245
00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.632
I could go another 100 miles. Come on.

246
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.634
No problem.

247
00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:44.415
Sparky, why don't you turn off the TV
and come to bed?

248
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.668
Okay, honey.

249
00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:09.774
Well, up and at them. We're here.

250
00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:32.421
Oh!

251
00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:36.258
Clark.

252
00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:39.595
- Can I do your back, honey?
- I've already done my back.

253
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.138
Can I do your front?

254
00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:43.099
Go do your own front.

255
00:19:48.521 --> 00:19:51.440
You know Clark, maybe we should
call Catherine and Eddie...

256
00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:55.403
...and tell them that we won't be in
until tomorrow afternoon.

257
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.987
Afternoon?

258
00:19:57.154 --> 00:20:00.825
If we're not there by 10:00 a.m., it's
gonna throw the schedule completely off.

259
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:02.952
I planned everything very carefully...

260
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.622
...so we'd be at Walley World
first thing Saturday morning.

261
00:20:07.915 --> 00:20:11.085
Sparky, I know how much
this trip means to you...

262
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:14.422
...and that you want all of us
to have a great time...

263
00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:17.299
...but it's a long way to Walley World.

264
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:22.054
And I think it'd be easier on all of us
if you'd just try to relax.

265
00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:26.600
I'm way ahead of you, honey.

266
00:20:32.982 --> 00:20:34.650
Oh.

267
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:36.485
When did you get these?

268
00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:39.155
I have my little secrets.

269
00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:44.618
- What a nice thought.
- Mm.

270
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.543
Don't drink yet.

271
00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:01.343
Ready for this?

272
00:21:07.308 --> 00:21:12.188
Ahh...
I'd like to propose a toast, if I may.

273
00:21:12.354 --> 00:21:16.025
Here's to a very restful vacation.

274
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.154
Here's to a very relaxing vacation...

275
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:22.907
...a renewed love affair...

276
00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:27.953
...and a time of joy with our babies.

277
00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:33.751
You know, honey, I never told you this.

278
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.170
I know it's been a rough beginning.

279
00:21:36.337 --> 00:21:38.380
I think there's something wrong here.

280
00:21:38.547 --> 00:21:41.175
It's the bed. It will slow up in a second.

281
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.304
I got it. Hold on to this. Enjoy it.

282
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:48.974
- Clark, what are you doing?
- Let's try this, my darling.

283
00:21:49.141 --> 00:21:51.227
Aha.

284
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:53.604
Now we're talking.

285
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:56.398
We haven't done this for a long time.

286
00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:02.071
Oh. Clark.

287
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.448
- What's that noise?
- What's going on?

288
00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:08.327
Hey. Don't you kids knock anymore?

289
00:22:08.869 --> 00:22:11.372
Sorry, we thought you were fighting
or something.

290
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.833
Nobody is fighting in here.

291
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.127
It's very late.

292
00:22:17.294 --> 00:22:18.629
Where is Mom?

293
00:22:18.796 --> 00:22:20.548
I'm under here, kids.

294
00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.758
Go back to bed.

295
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.261
Go back to bed, now. Rusty.

296
00:22:25.427 --> 00:22:27.012
The bed was very soft.

297
00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:29.473
Weird-o-rama.

298
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.267
Really.

299
00:22:33.602 --> 00:22:37.147
This is the street Wyatt Earp
used to keep law and order on.

300
00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.733
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.

301
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.111
Oh, Ellen, the Old West was dirty.

302
00:22:42.278 --> 00:22:44.947
Everything isn't like home.
If everything were like home...

303
00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:47.116
...there'd be no reason
for leaving. Right?

304
00:22:47.283 --> 00:22:48.951
Oh, yeah, Dad. This is great.

305
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:53.038
- You know, I'm glad we didn't go to Hawaii.
- I'll bet you are.

306
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.336
Okay. Kids!

307
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:02.298
Let's go get a drink. What do you say?
Here you go, champ.

308
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.385
Well.

309
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:11.015
Howdy, city slickers.

310
00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:14.727
Welcome to the Long Branch.
No fighting, no cussing, no gunslinging.

311
00:23:14.894 --> 00:23:18.814
Watch what you say to our bartender.
He's an ornery cuss.

312
00:23:19.023 --> 00:23:20.816
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- Marshal.

313
00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:22.484
Oh. Sorry.

314
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:23.903
It's no sweat.

315
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.988
Give me five, partner.

316
00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:32.786
That guy was a crummy Wyatt Earp.
He's wearing jogging shoes.

317
00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.413
They used to, Rusty.

318
00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.042
Hey, knucklehead.
Set us up with four redeyes, will you?

319
00:23:39.877 --> 00:23:41.837
Hey, yellow-belly. I'm talking to you.

320
00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.677
Hey, tenderfoot.
Move your chicken wings, turkey.

321
00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:57.061
Clark. That's not nice.

322
00:23:57.227 --> 00:23:59.772
It's all part of the act, hon.

323
00:23:59.939 --> 00:24:01.315
Hey, underpants.

324
00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:03.108
Hey, yellow--

325
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:05.861
Clark!

326
00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.322
I'm okay. I'm okay.

327
00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:09.823
I'm all right.

328
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:15.955
I don't think that's very funny. A noise
like that could impair the kids' hearing.

329
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.998
Oh, come on.

330
00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:21.502
It was real. It looked real, didn't it?
Hell, I thought it was a real gun.

331
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.712
Didn't it look real when I fell down, hon?

332
00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.756
- What?
- Didn't it look real, sweetie?

333
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.425
- What?
- Are you happy now, Clark?

334
00:24:28.592 --> 00:24:30.761
- She's deaf.
- What's the difference?

335
00:24:30.928 --> 00:24:33.555
It was fun anyway. Let's have a drink.
What do you say?

336
00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.057
Pardon me, sir?

337
00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:42.982
Catherine said we just stay on 50.

338
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:45.776
Well, I was thinking about
shooting over to 54...

339
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.112
- ...and zipping down to Liberal.
- What for?

340
00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.364
- The House of Mud.
- What's the House of Mud?

341
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:54.118
It's only the largest freestanding
mud dwelling ever built, that's all.

342
00:24:54.284 --> 00:24:57.496
You see, kids, the pioneers
didn't have bricks, so they used mud.

343
00:24:57.663 --> 00:25:00.249
They didn't use mud, they used sod, Dad.

344
00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.335
Right, Audrey, and when they
ran out of sod, they used mud.

345
00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:06.714
Clark, let's just skip the House of Mud.

346
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.508
I think Dodge City
was enough for one day.

347
00:25:09.675 --> 00:25:13.303
Besides, Catherine and Eddie
are expecting us.

348
00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:15.723
It's living history, Ellen.

349
00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:18.308
But if you'd rather see your cousins...

350
00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:19.685
...it's okay by me.

351
00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:22.563
Personally, I'd rather see a pile
of mud than Eddie.

352
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.441
- Knock it off.
- What's going on?

353
00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.901
Rusty is licking his hand
and touching me with it.

354
00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:30.279
Clark, tell Rusty to behave himself.

355
00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:32.072
Rusty, behave yourself.

356
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:35.451
Audrey's eating peanut butter
and smiling with it all over her teeth.

357
00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.703
Audrey, eat with your mouth closed.

358
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:41.623
- No eating in the car, kids.
- You suck, you know that?

359
00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.085
- Retard.
- I am trying to concentrate on the road.

360
00:25:56.805 --> 00:25:58.182
What did you say?

361
00:25:59.683 --> 00:26:03.312
Stop it, both of you.
Just give me the peanut butter.

362
00:26:08.942 --> 00:26:11.403
- He started it!
- I don't care who started it!

363
00:26:13.697 --> 00:26:15.032
I don't care who started it.

364
00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:18.118
I don't want to hear another word
out of either one of you.

365
00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:30.672
Clark, you're doing 80 miles an hour.

366
00:26:30.839 --> 00:26:33.675
- Doesn't seem like it, does it?
- Slow down.

367
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.346
I don't know why.
We're making good time.

368
00:26:39.807 --> 00:26:43.352
♪ <i>Love for sale</i> ♪

369
00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:45.813
♪ <i>Appetizing, yummy love for sale</i> ♪

370
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:05.124
Oh, they're here. Eddie, come on.

371
00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.210
Oh, I can't believe it. It's been an age!

372
00:27:08.377 --> 00:27:10.963
I never thought we'd get out here,
you look great!

373
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.299
- Eddie, get down here.
- Eddie, you look terrific.

374
00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.885
- Ellen, how are you?
- I never thought you'd get here.

375
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:18.762
Good to see you.

376
00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:22.432
Come and meet your second cousins.
Look how they've grown.

377
00:27:22.599 --> 00:27:24.935
And you have lost weight, Catherine.

378
00:27:25.102 --> 00:27:27.771
Yeah, added a few more mouths
to the litter.

379
00:27:29.273 --> 00:27:33.402
Let's see. Rusty and Audrey,
cousins Vicki and Dale.

380
00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:34.808
Hi.

381
00:27:35.017 --> 00:27:38.073
And this is Eddie
Junior and this is Junior.

382
00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.076
And this little moppet
on my skirts is Daisy-Mabel.

383
00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:43.495
Well. How old are you, little one?

384
00:27:43.662 --> 00:27:46.915
- She was born without a tongue, Clark.
- Ooh.

385
00:27:47.082 --> 00:27:50.252
But don't worry about her. She whistles
like a bird and eats like a horse.

386
00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:55.048
Take your little guests out back
and show them your worm farm.

387
00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.926
Go on, scoot.
Ellen, come in the house.

388
00:27:58.093 --> 00:28:01.930
- I've got so much to tell you.
- Look at the flowers. I love them.

389
00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.894
Oh, boy. Look at that car.

390
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.188
Yeah, that's the Family Truckster.

391
00:28:09.354 --> 00:28:13.108
Boy, she's a beaut.
I like those green walls.

392
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:16.111
We had some trouble in St. Louis.

393
00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:20.407
So you're looking really...

394
00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:22.075
...fit.

395
00:28:23.076 --> 00:28:25.454
This is the old homestead, huh?

396
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:31.585
Yeah, I don't know for how long, though.

397
00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:35.130
The bank's been after me
like flies on a rib roast.

398
00:28:35.297 --> 00:28:37.758
Yeah. I know the feeling.

399
00:28:38.759 --> 00:28:40.344
Fuck it.

400
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:47.809
- I bet you could use a cool one, huh?
- Now you're talking.

401
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.241
I'm going steady. And I French kiss.

402
00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:07.287
- So? Everyone does that.
- Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best at it.

403
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.793
Want a worm?

404
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.836
No, thanks.

405
00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:17.547
Hey, you got <i>Pac-Man?</i>

406
00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:19.591
No.

407
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.010
You got <i>Space Invaders?</i>

408
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:23.971
Nope.

409
00:29:24.554 --> 00:29:27.766
- You got <i>Asteroids?</i>
- No, but my dad does.

410
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:30.769
He can't even sit on the toilet some days.

411
00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.774
So, what do you do here, Dale?

412
00:29:35.941 --> 00:29:37.359
Well...

413
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.570
...I got a stack of nudie books this high.

414
00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:45.158
Oh, she's beautiful.

415
00:29:48.537 --> 00:29:53.709
- Would you sell me any of them?
- Shit, no. I cherish these things.

416
00:29:55.085 --> 00:29:56.628
I use them a lot.

417
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.465
How do you use a magazine?

418
00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:03.385
I was getting to that.

419
00:30:03.552 --> 00:30:07.764
A guy taught me something
really neat last year.

420
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.225
Did you ever bop your baloney?

421
00:30:17.357 --> 00:30:19.818
I guess we're 11, aren't we?

422
00:30:19.985 --> 00:30:24.573
- No, we're 12 with Aunt Edna.
- Aunt Edna? She's still alive?

423
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.199
Oh, you bet.

424
00:30:26.366 --> 00:30:30.162
I can't wait to see the look on
Clark's face when he hears that.

425
00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.582
Well, she came to help out
when Eddie ruptured his spleen...

426
00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:36.084
...and she's been with us ever since.

427
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.712
She wanted to go back
to Phoenix a year ago...

428
00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:40.881
...but Eddie wouldn't let her.

429
00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:46.303
Frankly, without her Social Security,
we'd never be able to live like this.

430
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.975
Gee, Cath, it looks like
you've really got your hands full.

431
00:30:52.142 --> 00:30:54.978
Oh, it's not so bad.

432
00:30:55.145 --> 00:30:58.690
Eddie says after the baby comes,
I can quit one of my night jobs.

433
00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.280
How do you like yours, Clark?

434
00:31:05.447 --> 00:31:07.741
Oh, medium-rare, a little pink inside.

435
00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:10.243
No, your bun. Light or dark?

436
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.121
Oh. Either way, it doesn't matter.

437
00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:17.834
Vicki, can I help you with that Kool-Aid?
Please?

438
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:20.128
Mm-mm-mm.

439
00:31:20.318 --> 00:31:22.872
I don't know why they call
this stuff Hamburger Helper.

440
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.092
It does just fine by itself.

441
00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:29.054
I like it better than Tuna Helper myself.
Don't you, Clark?

442
00:31:29.221 --> 00:31:32.099
You're the gourmet around here, Ed. Heh.

443
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.438
No meat in this?

444
00:31:38.605 --> 00:31:42.442
You get plenty of meat at home.
Be polite. Have some ketchup.

445
00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:48.824
Real tomato ketchup, Eddie?

446
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.159
Nothing but the best.

447
00:31:52.536 --> 00:31:55.747
Aunt Edna. Helper's getting cold.

448
00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:59.543
Is that your Aunt Edna?

449
00:32:07.676 --> 00:32:12.889
Aunt Edna. After all these years.
You're looking so good.

450
00:32:16.977 --> 00:32:19.604
Hi, Edna. Nice to see you again.

451
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:22.899
You remember Clark, don't you?

452
00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:28.363
You were the ones who sent me
the fruitcake for Christmas.

453
00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:31.074
It made me so sick.

454
00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:34.953
I'm sorry.
We thought you enjoyed fruitcake.

455
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.706
You enjoy throwing up
every five minutes, Claude?

456
00:32:37.873 --> 00:32:41.042
- Clark.
- I thought so.

457
00:32:41.418 --> 00:32:45.505
Well, am I going to eat
or am I gonna starve to death?

458
00:32:48.717 --> 00:32:50.051
Catherine.

459
00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:53.847
Did you tell Clark and Ellen
the good news?

460
00:32:54.014 --> 00:32:56.433
No. I was just about to.

461
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.643
Catherine, what's the good news?

462
00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.147
You're driving me to Phoenix.

463
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:16.369
Junior Pig Competition?

464
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.580
You won this for raising a pig?

465
00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:21.333
Yeah. First Place.

466
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.294
Does anybody know about it?

467
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:25.712
Everybody knows.

468
00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:32.260
Vicki, don't get offended, but being
a farmer is not too cool, you know.

469
00:33:34.054 --> 00:33:35.889
Oh, yeah?

470
00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:40.018
Well, how cool...

471
00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.895
...is this?

472
00:33:48.944 --> 00:33:53.240
I'm real glad that things
are going good for you, Clark.

473
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:57.035
Mm-hm. Tsk.

474
00:33:57.202 --> 00:34:02.791
I got laid off when they closed
that asbestos factory. Ahem.

475
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:04.668
And now, wouldn't you know it...

476
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:06.920
...the Army cut my disability pension...

477
00:34:07.087 --> 00:34:12.092
...because they said the plate in my head
wasn't big enough. Shoo.

478
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:18.723
Eddie, Clark and Ellen don't want to hear
about our troubles.

479
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:20.350
No, no. It's very interesting.

480
00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:23.562
Why don't you just ask him
for the money, Eddie?

481
00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:25.564
He sure as hell can't take a hint.

482
00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:30.527
Well, I didn't want to ask you,
Clark, you know, but...

483
00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:34.406
Could you, maybe,
spare a little extra cash?

484
00:34:34.573 --> 00:34:36.616
Sure, Eddie.

485
00:34:41.037 --> 00:34:42.622
How much do you need?

486
00:34:42.789 --> 00:34:44.791
About $52,000.

487
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.422
Goodbye, baby.

488
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:52.424
And you'll send those checks?

489
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:54.718
- All taken care of.
- Okay.

490
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:58.346
- Okay, let's go. Come on, Edna.
- Lay off, lay off.

491
00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:01.349
Well, gotta be going.

492
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:04.019
- What's this?
- This is for you, Clark.

493
00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:05.937
Oh, what is it?

494
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:09.524
- Gift.
- You didn't have to buy me a gift, Eddie.

495
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:10.984
Oh, go on, open it.

496
00:35:11.151 --> 00:35:12.527
Oh.

497
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:16.781
Oh, Eddie, you shouldn't have.

498
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.701
- You really shouldn't have.
- Those are great, Dad.

499
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:22.412
- Quiet down, Russ.
- Try them on.

500
00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.247
No, I don't want to get them dirty.

501
00:35:24.414 --> 00:35:26.541
I told you he wouldn't like them, Eddie.

502
00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:29.294
- I love them.
- I knew you did...

503
00:35:29.461 --> 00:35:33.048
...because the last time I saw you you
remarked about how much you liked mine.

504
00:35:33.214 --> 00:35:36.468
- Well, I guess we'd better be going.
- Yeah.

505
00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:38.053
- Whew.
- Ha-ha.

506
00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:39.304
- Bye, Eddie.
- Bye, Ellen.

507
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.849
- Bye, Clark. It's was great having you here.
- Goodbye. Thank you. Okay.

508
00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.436
Here he is, Uncle Clark,
all walked and everything.

509
00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:48.104
What is this? A dog?

510
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:51.524
He's Aunt Edna's. His name is Dinky.
He watches <i>Family Feud.</i>

511
00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:54.569
Oh. Hi, how are you, little fellow?

512
00:35:56.237 --> 00:35:57.739
Easy.

513
00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:01.618
Yeah. You folks didn't
get to meet Dinky last night.

514
00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:04.037
He had the shits, so he slept in the barn.

515
00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:08.249
Ah. Well, great. Better make some space
for him in the back. Come on.

516
00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:12.545
Ow! No. No. Sit, sit. Roll over.
Come on, heel.

517
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:16.257
- Here. Have a good trip.
- Thanks, Vic.

518
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:27.394
Bye! Bye, kids, bye, Aunt Edna. Bye-bye!

519
00:36:43.952 --> 00:36:46.705
Look at these sandwiches.
Here, Aunt Edna.

520
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:48.456
Thank you.

521
00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:50.125
Audrey.

522
00:36:51.084 --> 00:36:54.129
Oh, Rusty, stop playing with the dog
and come and have some lunch.

523
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.386
Oh, Clark, look.

524
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:04.639
Your favorite, baloney and cheese.

525
00:37:07.517 --> 00:37:09.769
And what should I have?

526
00:37:09.936 --> 00:37:13.940
Maybe some fruit or something like that.

527
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.590
Mom, my sandwich is all wet.

528
00:38:20.757 --> 00:38:22.634
Well, they're all wet.

529
00:38:23.468 --> 00:38:27.847
Oh, God. The dog went
on the picnic basket.

530
00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:28.950
Russ, look.

531
00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:31.786
Excellent. They have a pool.

532
00:39:32.704 --> 00:39:35.290
Aren't the woods beautiful?

533
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:39.294
Clark. Dinkums needs a long walk
and a bath.

534
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.088
Rusty, take care of Dinkums.

535
00:39:42.255 --> 00:39:45.300
- Dad, he bites.
- Bite him back.

536
00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:06.696
- We'd like three tents for the night, please.
- All right. That'll be $37.

537
00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.990
Thirty-seven dollars
for three tents?

538
00:40:09.157 --> 00:40:10.491
Oh, they're very nice tents.

539
00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:13.995
And that price includes scenery
and wildlife fun.

540
00:40:15.997 --> 00:40:18.333
Oh, come on, Clark.
It seems like a nice place.

541
00:40:18.499 --> 00:40:21.210
It's got a pool and everything.

542
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.963
- All right.
- Here you go.

543
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.716
- Fill out that.
- Mm-hm.

544
00:40:31.012 --> 00:40:33.973
Clark W. Griswold. You want my street?

545
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.183
Please.

546
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.436
- What do you need my address for?
- We like to send out a mailer.

547
00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.525
- I can't wait to get in.
- Me, too.

548
00:40:44.692 --> 00:40:46.361
Get our bathing--

549
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.155
Ugh.

550
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:52.116
That's disgusting.

551
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:58.456
Too cheap to pay for a hotel room, huh?

552
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:04.462
Ooh. Clark, this tent smells.

553
00:41:05.213 --> 00:41:06.506
Edna, this is your tent.

554
00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:28.069
Sp-- Sparky.

555
00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:31.406
- This isn't very romantic.
- Isn't it?

556
00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:36.452
No, I don't think there's enough room
for two in this sleeping bag.

557
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:39.414
Honey, right now, we're one.

558
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.626
- One heart beating for two.
- Oh, Sparky.

559
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:51.509
Sparky, there's a wild animal.

560
00:41:51.676 --> 00:41:52.927
- Yeah.
- No.

561
00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:56.139
- I know, I'm gonna go for it, honey.
- Wild animal-- No.

562
00:41:58.474 --> 00:42:01.227
Ow! Get off. Down. Go.

563
00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:04.397
I'm sorry, honey. It's Dinky. Get off!

564
00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:10.069
I'll kill that dog.

565
00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:13.614
I'm sorry.

566
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.371
Ah.

567
00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:23.624
What do you say, honey? Uhn!

568
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:26.919
In spite of all the little problems,
it really is fun, isn't it?

569
00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:28.421
No.

570
00:42:28.588 --> 00:42:31.966
But with every new day
there's fresh hope.

571
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:35.887
Hey, kids, let's go.

572
00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:38.139
We're losing daylight here.

573
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:40.141
Hey, did you walk him?

574
00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:42.935
Yeah. He took a big one
on Aunt Edna's blanket.

575
00:42:43.478 --> 00:42:45.772
- Good boy.
- Help!

576
00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:48.232
Oh, boy. Go take care of Aunt Edna.
I'll take the leash.

577
00:42:50.777 --> 00:42:52.737
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

578
00:42:52.904 --> 00:42:55.281
Roll over. Ow.

579
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:57.575
Dinky.

580
00:42:57.992 --> 00:43:00.745
Ow! You're tearing my flesh!

581
00:43:00.912 --> 00:43:04.624
Good morning, Edna. Ah!
No, Dinky. Sit. Roll over.

582
00:43:05.666 --> 00:43:07.835
Ah. Ah, ow!

583
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.962
Audrey, you're next.

584
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:11.923
- No way, José.
- Hey, Audrey.

585
00:43:13.466 --> 00:43:14.509
What's the problem?

586
00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:18.471
Ma, I had to sit next to Aunt Edna
last time. She smells like mothballs.

587
00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:19.764
Anyway, it's her turn.

588
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:23.851
For your information,
Rusty slept in his underpants last night.

589
00:43:24.018 --> 00:43:26.687
- Yeah, I did.
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy, kids. Cut it out.

590
00:43:26.854 --> 00:43:30.441
Everybody in the car,
boat leaves in two minutes.

591
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:34.278
Or perhaps, you don't want to see
the second-largest ball of twine on Earth.

592
00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.114
Which is only four short hours away.

593
00:43:43.663 --> 00:43:45.540
Sweetie, do you hear that rattle?

594
00:43:45.873 --> 00:43:48.709
- Where is it coming from?
- Beats the heck out of me.

595
00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:52.463
I've been looking for it ever since we left.
It's driving me crazy.

596
00:43:52.922 --> 00:43:55.550
God, Dad, check it out behind you.

597
00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:57.593
Oh, shoot. Now what have we done?

598
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:00.555
- Will you hold my purse?
- Huh?

599
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:02.890
Just hold my purse.

600
00:44:22.743 --> 00:44:24.912
Hello, officer. What's the problem?

601
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:29.625
Get out of the car.

602
00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.342
I don't think I was speeding.
Was I weaving?

603
00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.511
Shut your mouth, sir.

604
00:44:42.054 --> 00:44:45.641
If I wasn't in uniform, I'd split your skull
with the butt of this revolver...

605
00:44:45.808 --> 00:44:48.477
...faster than you could say
"police brutality."

606
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:52.398
Well, officer, whatever it is I've done,
I'm sure I can explain.

607
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.988
Explain this, you son of a bitch.

608
00:44:59.155 --> 00:45:01.073
Oh, my God.

609
00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:06.621
Do you know what the penalty
for animal cruelty is in this state?

610
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:08.372
No, sir, I don't.

611
00:45:08.664 --> 00:45:10.124
Well...

612
00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.376
It's probably pretty stiff.

613
00:45:13.085 --> 00:45:15.838
You can't think
I'd do this on purpose, sir.

614
00:45:16.005 --> 00:45:19.675
Look, I tied him to the rear bumper
when I was packing the car.

615
00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:22.637
It was very confusing, I must've forgot.

616
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.515
I'm very sorry. I feel terrible.

617
00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:29.602
How do you think that little dog feels?

618
00:45:34.273 --> 00:45:38.027
Look, I told you I was sorry.
It really was an accident.

619
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:42.990
Yeah. I guess I can buy that, sir.

620
00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.117
But it is a shame.

621
00:45:45.534 --> 00:45:48.412
I had a pooch like this when I was a kid.

622
00:45:50.998 --> 00:45:52.250
Poor little guy.

623
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:55.336
He probably kept up with you
for a mile or so.

624
00:45:56.629 --> 00:45:58.089
- Tough little mutt.
- Tough.

625
00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:00.466
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

626
00:46:08.391 --> 00:46:10.810
I was afraid you'd get pulled over, Clark.

627
00:46:10.977 --> 00:46:14.689
You've been exceeding the speed limit
for thousands of miles.

628
00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:17.692
Dad wasn't speeding.
The cop stopped us because Dad forgot--

629
00:46:17.858 --> 00:46:20.653
- He was speeding, Rusty.
- No, he wasn't, Mom.

630
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.447
Russ! Listen to your mother.
I was speeding.

631
00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:24.991
I was driving like a maniac.

632
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:27.660
We can all be grateful
to this man for stopping us.

633
00:46:27.827 --> 00:46:29.537
- You see, a car--
- Here's the leash.

634
00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:32.331
I'm going to get the rest
of the carcass off the road.

635
00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:34.250
- Thank you, officer.
- See you.

636
00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:36.002
Have a nice day.

637
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.851
This your idea of a good restaurant?

638
00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:54.103
Dog killer.

639
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.564
I'm sure the food is just fine.

640
00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:58.941
Uh-uh-uh. New car, I'll take it.

641
00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.443
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

642
00:47:00.609 --> 00:47:03.696
Oh, kids. Oh, kids. Mm-mm.

643
00:47:06.741 --> 00:47:07.783
Waitress.

644
00:48:17.978 --> 00:48:19.647
What happened?

645
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:23.359
What happened to your hair?

646
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.236
You're sweating.

647
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:28.489
- Are you blushing?
- Don't be silly.

648
00:48:28.656 --> 00:48:30.157
Are you all right, Clark?

649
00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:32.535
Hell, yes. I'm fine. I'm having a ball.

650
00:48:39.792 --> 00:48:42.169
Come on, honey, look at the mountains,
breathe the air.

651
00:48:45.339 --> 00:48:48.008
Put on a happy face for me.

652
00:48:52.555 --> 00:48:56.016
I guess there's not much more
that can happen to us.

653
00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:58.644
I think the worst is behind us.

654
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:09.613
Clark, I need my vanity case.

655
00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.866
We've got to go back and look for it.

656
00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:13.701
All my credit cards are in it.

657
00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:17.538
Honey, number one, I've already called
the bank and told them you've lost them.

658
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:21.041
B, there's no way we're gonna find it.
We don't know where it fell off.

659
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:24.879
And three, I've got my credit cards
and we've still got plenty of cash. Okay?

660
00:49:25.045 --> 00:49:27.798
No, we don't. You gave $500 to Eddie...

661
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:31.552
...and everything has cost twice
as much as you figured out.

662
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:34.263
There's nothing in that luggage
that can't be replaced.

663
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.474
Except for your diaphragm.

664
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.018
We can always cash a check
down the road.

665
00:49:39.185 --> 00:49:40.769
Don't you trust me?

666
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:44.565
As long as you don't tie me
to the rear bumper.

667
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:49.069
That hurt, Ellen.

668
00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:53.407
- Clark, I think we're lost.
- We're not lost.

669
00:49:53.574 --> 00:49:55.576
Will you please let me do the driving?

670
00:49:55.743 --> 00:50:00.080
I honestly don't think you're gonna
find the Grand Canyon on this road.

671
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:02.875
Jesus, it's only the biggest
goddamn hole in the world.

672
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:04.877
Clark, watch your language.

673
00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:06.795
Make that the second-biggest.

674
00:50:06.962 --> 00:50:09.757
Dad, I haven't seen a car for an hour.

675
00:50:09.924 --> 00:50:12.676
Shut up, Audrey. You don't think
Dad knows where he's going?

676
00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.095
- Thank you, Russ.
- You're lost.

677
00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:19.934
- I saw some detour signs.
- I didn't see any.

678
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.354
I saw them when you and Mom
were trying to fold the map.

679
00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:26.732
When they close a road
they put up big signs. Like this one.

680
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:52.091
- I think I broke my nose.
- I stabbed my brain.

681
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:54.802
I just got my period.

682
00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:57.096
I'd better check under the hood.

683
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:12.111
Audrey, gather up the clothes
and put them in a pile.

684
00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:15.573
Rusty, find the first-aid kit,
then get the suitcases.

685
00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:17.741
Mom, where can I go to the bathroom?

686
00:51:18.492 --> 00:51:20.452
Find a bush, Audrey.

687
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.374
Dad, you must've jumped this thing
about 50 yards.

688
00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:28.544
It's nothing to be proud of, Rusty.

689
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:31.046
Fifty yards. Heh.

690
00:51:31.213 --> 00:51:35.342
Ellen! Ellen, get me out of here.

691
00:51:35.509 --> 00:51:37.928
Stay in the car.
It's hot and dangerous out here.

692
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:41.265
Don't you tell me what to do.
I'll do what I want.

693
00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:44.018
I should never have come
on this trip with you.

694
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:45.728
I should have taken an airplane.

695
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:49.690
And he-- He shouldn't even have a license
to drive an automobile.

696
00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:53.193
He should be behind bars.

697
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.822
Sit down and shut up.

698
00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:06.498
Move out of that seat,
and I'll split your lip.

699
00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:16.300
Rusty, come on up here.

700
00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.385
Hello, Russ.

701
00:52:18.552 --> 00:52:21.263
I'm gonna hike down the road
to find a service station.

702
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.725
I want you to stay here
and take care of things.

703
00:52:24.892 --> 00:52:28.729
- You'll be okay, Dad?
- Oh, sure, sure, sure.

704
00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:33.025
You know, I haven't had much of a chance
to talk to you man to man, Russ.

705
00:52:33.192 --> 00:52:34.943
Well, I've only been a man
a few days, Dad.

706
00:52:37.738 --> 00:52:40.491
You're growing up so damn fast.

707
00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:42.993
I've spent the last 15 years of my life...

708
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.872
...developing newer
and better food additives.

709
00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:49.833
I guess I've missed an awful lot.

710
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:54.213
At first,
I didn't want to take this vacation.

711
00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:56.882
But now I'm glad I did.

712
00:52:57.049 --> 00:53:00.594
It's given me a chance
to spend a lot more time with you and...

713
00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:03.263
- Audrey.
- Audrey. Yeah.

714
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:08.143
You know, it's been real fun for me,
too, Dad. Really.

715
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.479
Except for Aunt Edna.

716
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:12.981
Oh, she doesn't mean
to be a pain in the rump.

717
00:53:13.148 --> 00:53:14.942
It's just the way she is.

718
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:18.362
- Let's not let it spoil our fun.
- I won't.

719
00:53:18.529 --> 00:53:21.699
You know, maybe she'd be nicer
if she had a family of her own.

720
00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:26.078
You know, instead of always
having to glom onto someone else's.

721
00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:29.915
You're a pretty bright little guy.

722
00:53:30.082 --> 00:53:31.917
Excuse me. Man.

723
00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.590
It's okay, Dad.

724
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.052
You know what I wanna do?

725
00:53:44.138 --> 00:53:47.266
When I was your age,
my dad shared a beer with me...

726
00:53:47.433 --> 00:53:49.893
...and I thought it was
the best thing in the world.

727
00:53:55.774 --> 00:53:56.942
Ahh...

728
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:04.992
When I was a boy, just about
every summer we'd take a vacation.

729
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:08.036
And you know, in 18 years...

730
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:10.122
...we never had fun.

731
00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.084
But now I have my own family.

732
00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:15.669
And we're on our own vacation.

733
00:54:15.836 --> 00:54:18.464
- And you know something, Russ?
- What, Dad?

734
00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:21.842
We're gonna have fun.

735
00:54:26.305 --> 00:54:27.347
We're gonna have fun.

736
00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:34.062
Hey. Don't let your mother smell beer
on your breath. She'll take it out on me.

737
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:39.276
Well, I better get a move on if I want
to get us out of here by dark.

738
00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:42.946
Good talk, son.

739
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:44.865
Good talk, Dad.

740
00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:47.201
Clark?

741
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:55.918
I just had a good talk with Rusty.
You'll be in good hands here, honey.

742
00:54:57.586 --> 00:54:59.254
Where are you going?

743
00:54:59.421 --> 00:55:03.050
There's gotta be a phone or a gas station
around here somewhere, honey.

744
00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:07.012
All right, but if you're not back
in an hour...

745
00:55:07.179 --> 00:55:10.182
I'll be fine. You'll be fine.
I'm sure this happens all the time.

746
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:12.643
A patrol car will be by any minute.

We pass a goddamn gas station
every 100 yards for 1,000 miles.

757
00:55:53.559 --> 00:55:56.603
But when you really need one,
you end up walking your ass off.

758
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:59.273
This is no way to run a desert.

759
00:55:59.439 --> 00:56:02.484
Jesus. I'm gonna die. That's it! I'm dying.

760
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:05.362
What an asshole.

761
00:56:10.367 --> 00:56:12.703
Taxi. Taxi? Taxi!

762
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:14.329
Dead. I'm dead.

763
00:56:14.496 --> 00:56:17.666
Taxi! Here boy.

764
00:56:17.916 --> 00:56:21.795
Heat. The heat.
I'm dying. I'm dead. I'm finished.

765
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:25.674
Hot. Hot.

766
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.893
Hot wrist.

767
00:56:43.317 --> 00:56:45.485
Mom, Mommy?

768
00:56:53.952 --> 00:56:55.954
I'm not sure of his exact height
and weight.

769
00:56:56.121 --> 00:56:58.373
All I know is the man
was a saint with children...

770
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.334
...and a genius with food additives...

771
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.502
...and he was-- Clark!

772
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:03.879
Ellen!

773
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:07.799
- I was so worried.
- Russ.

774
00:57:07.966 --> 00:57:09.927
- What are you doing?
- Russ, Russ!

775
00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:12.846
Audrey? Audrey.

776
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.349
Have you grown?

777
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:17.851
- Are you all right?
- I feel fine.

778
00:57:18.018 --> 00:57:19.770
What happened? How did you get here?

779
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:23.148
Well, these two nice Indians
and a man on a camel called a tow truck.

780
00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:25.651
- Daddy's back.
- A camel?

781
00:57:25.817 --> 00:57:28.195
A camel. Hey, kids, are you thirsty?

782
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:31.448
- Yeah, I bet you are, too.
- You said it.

783
00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:54.388
Okay. What do I owe you?

784
00:57:54.638 --> 00:57:57.975
Never heard of no one so shit-all stupid
as you driving off that road.

785
00:57:58.141 --> 00:58:01.061
You must have got
manure for your brains.

786
00:58:01.228 --> 00:58:03.855
Yes, well, I'm from out of town.

787
00:58:04.022 --> 00:58:05.732
What's the bill?

788
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.613
Come on, come on. How much?

789
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.073
How much you got?

790
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.701
No, I'm asking how much the repairs are.

791
00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:18.912
And I'm asking you, how much you got?

792
00:58:20.539 --> 00:58:22.290
You're out of your mind.

793
00:58:22.749 --> 00:58:25.127
I don't have time to play around.
How much is it?

794
00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:27.879
All of it, boy.

795
00:58:29.464 --> 00:58:31.466
What does your sheriff think
of your business practices?

796
00:58:54.156 --> 00:58:56.950
Audrey, honey, how much
babysitting money do you have?

797
00:58:57.117 --> 00:58:59.286
- How come?
- How much?

798
00:58:59.453 --> 00:59:00.537
What's the matter?

799
00:59:00.704 --> 00:59:05.208
Nothing. I just spent $500
on four bald tires and a tow.

800
00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:06.752
How much do you have, Audrey?

801
00:59:08.253 --> 00:59:11.048
- Thirty-five.
- She has $40, Dad.

802
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:13.925
How would you know
unless you went in my purse, you sneak?

803
00:59:14.092 --> 00:59:16.595
Have you been going through
her private property?

804
00:59:16.762 --> 00:59:19.139
I don't give a frog's fat ass
who went through what.

805
00:59:19.306 --> 00:59:20.974
We need money.

806
00:59:21.975 --> 00:59:23.935
Edna, how much do you have?

807
00:59:24.102 --> 00:59:25.812
She's asleep, Clark.

808
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:28.732
Russ, wanna look through Edna's purse?

809
00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:30.692
Clark.

810
00:59:36.114 --> 00:59:37.657
Unzip it, Russ.

811
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:44.289
- She has 11 cents, Dad.
- Terrific.

812
00:59:44.456 --> 00:59:47.000
The motel will cash your check.

813
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.127
They better. We're gonna run out of gas.

814
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:57.636
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't accept this credit card.

815
00:59:57.803 --> 01:00:00.847
- Why not?
- The computer says it's been reported lost.

816
01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:05.352
Oh, no. You see, my wife lost her cards
in Colorado and I had to report it.

817
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:08.355
The computer is probably saying
I lost mine, which I haven't.

818
01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.608
Well, you'll have to straighten
that out with your bank.

819
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.070
- Would you take a personal check?
- For how much?

820
01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.781
- Three-hundred dollars.
- I can't do that, sir.

821
01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:20.534
I've lost all my cash.
We're on our way to California.

822
01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.912
- Walley World?
- Yeah. Walley World.

823
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.790
And I'm sort of stuck between a rock
and a hard place.

824
01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:31.044
- You know, I'd really appreciate it.
- Not without a major credit card.

825
01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:36.049
I have $6.13 to my name...

826
01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:38.885
...so I can see we're gonna
have to work something out.

827
01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.304
I've already told you
I can't accept a check...

828
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.098
...without a major credit card.

829
01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.308
I'm making this out for $1,000.

830
01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:50.230
All you have to do is give me $300 in cash,
and keep $700...

831
01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:53.900
...all for doing nothing more
than acting like a total creep.

832
01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:56.736
The only thing I can do...

833
01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.865
...is have you stay here
until the check clears.

834
01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.492
Ten working days.

835
01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:32.230
Okay, let's go, come on. Ha-ha.
Where is Edna?

836
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.816
- She's in the car.
- Good. Come on, get in the car.

837
01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.986
Don't you want to look
at the Grand Canyon?

838
01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:41.489
Great, let's go.

839
01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.543
Rusty, up and at them.

840
01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:55.837
What?

841
01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.757
Crack open those sandwiches
I got at the gas station.

842
01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:02.260
I'm so hungry, I could eat a sandwich
from a gas station. Ha-ha-ha.

843
01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.138
There's one for everyone.

844
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:09.267
Audrey, wake up Aunt Edna.
It's time for her to eat and take her pill.

845
01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:11.937
Please, get off me.

846
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.397
Mom, tell Audrey to quit pushing
Aunt Edna on me.

847
01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.858
I'm sick of her lying on me all the time.

848
01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:19.319
Be quiet.

849
01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:22.948
- Auntie?
- Honey, it's only a few hours to Phoenix.

850
01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.034
- Let her be, she's fine.
- She's not fine.

851
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.411
She's fine. Don't be silly.

852
01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:31.039
She's not fine, Clark.

853
01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:32.415
She's dead.

854
01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:42.842
She breathed on me.
A dead person breathed on me.

855
01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.595
Her hand touched me.
She's stiff already. Ugh.

856
01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.016
Ugh.

857
01:02:57.232 --> 01:02:58.858
Goddamn it, anyway.

858
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.038
She must have passed away
somewhere near Flagstaff.

859
01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.917
What are we going to do, Clark?

860
01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.714
We could leave her here.
The first phone we pass...

861
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.550
...we could call your cousin
and he could come and get her.

862
01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:25.427
That's the meanest, coldest--

863
01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:27.804
What do you want me to do,
call Federal Express?

864
01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.473
We don't have to ride
with a dead person, do we?

865
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.017
Please say we don't.

866
01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.394
It'd be real easy for Cousin Normie
to find her.

867
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.022
All he'd have to do
is look for the buzzards.

868
01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:40.608
Hell. We'll drive her to Cousin Normie's,
for Pete's sake.

869
01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:44.404
I just didn't want to get caught up
in a funeral, inquests and all that crap.

870
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:49.868
You are the most self-centered,
egotistical, manipulative--

871
01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:52.412
Don't say anything you'll regret, Ellen.

872
01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.998
I'm being practical.
If we drove straight through...

873
01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:58.209
...we'd have three days
at Walley World at best. Three.

874
01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:03.256
She can't weigh more than 100 pounds.

875
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.468
Oh, no. You can't put her up on that roof.

876
01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:07.844
Yes, he can.

877
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:11.931
You want me to strap her to the hood?
What's the difference? She'll be fine.

878
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.601
It's not as if it's going to rain
or something.

879
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:44.839
This is terrible. Ugh.

880
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.425
What a nightmare.

881
01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.652
Don't just blurt it out about Edna dying.

882
01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.488
How about if I ask him
to play twenty questions?

883
01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.611
Oh, for Christ's sake,
he isn't even home.

884
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:20.792
Maybe the neighbors
know where he is.

885
01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:24.838
- Moron knows we're coming and isn't home.
- Normie's always been flighty.

886
01:05:25.004 --> 01:05:27.549
- He's always been a jag-off.
- Will you watch your mouth?

887
01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.175
There's a note.

888
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.430
"Have gone to Flagstaff.
Be back on Monday."

889
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.723
Jeez, what a worm.

890
01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:59.372
Oh-- Darn, it's locked.

891
01:06:03.376 --> 01:06:05.295
Okay, let's go.

892
01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.173
We can't leave her on the patio.

893
01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:12.552
You rather I slip her in the night-deposit
box at the funeral home? Come on.

894
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.054
It's raining all over her.

895
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.891
She can't catch a cold now, Mom.

896
01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.478
Clark, we have to at least say something.

897
01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.439
Okay, bow your heads, bow your heads.

898
01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.649
Oh, God.

899
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.820
Ease our suffering in this,
our moment of great despair.

900
01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:35.783
Yea, admit this good and decent woman
into thine arms and the flock...

901
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.036
...in thine heavenly area up there.

902
01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:43.833
And Moab he laidest down
behind the land of the Canaanites.

903
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.629
And, yea, though the Hindus speak
of karma--

904
01:06:47.795 --> 01:06:49.964
- Clark.
- I implore you...

905
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.675
- ...give her a break.
- Clark.

906
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:01.768
Clark, this is a serious matter.
I'll do it myself.

907
01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:06.147
Honey, I'm not an ordained minister.
I'm doing my best, okay?

908
01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:10.276
Lord, we love this woman
with all our hearts.

909
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:13.279
- Let's not overdo it, Mom.
- Shut up.

910
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.907
We know she deserves better than this...

911
01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:20.203
...but my husband wants his beloved family
to get to Walley World...

912
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.955
...to have their vacation.

913
01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.083
I hope you understand.
Have mercy on his soul.

914
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.544
Amen. Let's go. Come on.

915
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.755
I hope you kids have learned
something about life and death.

916
01:07:30.922 --> 01:07:34.092
Yeah. Don't die unless somebody's home.

917
01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:39.138
Normie will understand when he sees
the note we pinned on Edna's sleeve.

918
01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:43.309
Sure. You left his dead mother
tied to a lawn chair in his backyard.

919
01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.562
I'm sure he won't mind.

920
01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:47.647
Look, it's all over and done with.

921
01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:51.067
We'll find a place to stay and start fresh
in the morning. It's fine.

922
01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.028
I don't want to be in the car anymore.
I want to go home.

923
01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.989
I don't want to go to Walley World.

924
01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:59.867
Clark, under the circumstances,
I wouldn't mind if we just went home.

925
01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:02.745
In retrospect, it seems like
a pretty bad idea driving out.

926
01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.956
It's been one disaster after another.

927
01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:08.001
Yeah, it's been a real drag, Dad.

928
01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.336
Maybe we can try it some other time.

929
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:14.507
- Walley World's overrated anyway.
- What do you think?

930
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.593
[TIRES SQUEAL

931
01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.346
I think you're all fucked in the head.

932
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:24.058
We're ten hours from the fucking
fun park and you want to bail out.

933
01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:27.020
Well, I'll tell you something.
This is no longer a vacation.

934
01:08:27.186 --> 01:08:29.647
It's a quest. It's a quest for fun.

935
01:08:30.398 --> 01:08:32.483
I'm gonna have fun
and you're gonna have fun.

936
01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:34.611
We're all gonna have
so much fucking fun...

937
01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:37.655
...we'll need plastic surgery
to remove our goddamn smiles.

938
01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:41.284
You'll be whistling "zippity-doo-dah"
out of your assholes.

939
01:08:42.744 --> 01:08:45.788
I gotta be crazy. I'm on a pilgrimage
to see a moose.

940
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.792
Praise Marty Moose. Holy shit.

941
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.712
Dad, do you want
an aspirin or something?

942
01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.714
Don't touch.

943
01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:11.230
Next time you have
one of your outbursts...

944
01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:14.400
...I'd appreciate if you'd have
some consideration for your kids.

945
01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.819
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know?

946
01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.156
All I know is I'm trying to treat my family
to a little fun.

947
01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.742
Spare me, Clark.
I know your brand of family fun.

948
01:09:22.909 --> 01:09:26.120
Tomorrow you'll probably
kill the desk clerk, hold up a McDonald's...

949
01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:30.541
...and drive us a thousand miles out of the
way to see the world's largest ball of mud.

950
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:33.002
You know what your problem is, Ellen?

951
01:09:34.253 --> 01:09:38.132
You have a knack for looking at the
dark side of things. That's your problem.

952
01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:41.886
You wouldn't know a good time
if it bit you.

953
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.931
- Where are you going?
- What do you care?

954
01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:18.399
Waiting for someone?

955
01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:22.570
No. Ahem.
Do you mind if I sit down?

956
01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:26.324
Fancy seeing you here.

957
01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.660
Having a nice little family vacation?

958
01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.791
Oh. No.

959
01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:37.794
It would appear so, wouldn't it? No, no.

960
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.589
No, the truth of it is,
and this is highly confidential...

961
01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:44.133
...I own this motel.

962
01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:49.138
Own the whole chain, nationwide.
Twenty-two hundred units.

963
01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.935
Yeah, once a year,
I travel across the country, incognito.

964
01:11:54.101 --> 01:11:56.646
Check things out,
and see how the operation is running.

965
01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.357
I thought you were gonna say
you worked for the CIA.

966
01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.821
- That's an old bit, huh?
- Really.

967
01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.865
Oh, no. No, I'm not with the CIA.

968
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.910
I was, but that was a long time ago.

969
01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:13.663
I don't like to talk about it, really.

970
01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:17.291
No, I'm mostly interested
in my motels now.

971
01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:20.169
- And my airline.
- That's great.

972
01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.588
I'm just trying to have a little fun.

973
01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.924
It's too bad you're married.

974
01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:27.051
I'm in the mood for some fun.

975
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.178
Married?

976
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.931
Oh, you mean those people I'm with?

977
01:12:32.098 --> 01:12:34.183
That's my brother's family.

978
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.852
My brother's ring.

979
01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:39.856
I usually borrow them on
these little inspection tours of mine.

980
01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:44.652
It sort of helps to complete the disguise.
It's fun for them.

981
01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:48.155
It's a good disguise.
I like the station-wagon effect.

982
01:12:48.322 --> 01:12:51.367
Yeah? Well, that's a big part of it.

983
01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:56.581
You know, in order to be convincing, you
have to look and act like an ordinary jerk.

984
01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:02.628
You know, stop at all the stupid sites
and look like a fool.

985
01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:05.548
Basically, be yourself?

986
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.300
Yeah.

987
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.927
You like the disguise?

988
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:18.311
Yeah, my credo is,
if you have to have a credo...

989
01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.188
...you know, "Go for it," pretty much.

990
01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:25.693
You only go around this crazy
merry-go-round once. You know?

991
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:28.529
- I agree.
- Yeah.

992
01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.620
Yeah, that's my credo.

993
01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:42.251
You don't have to have a credo, but...

994
01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:43.711
If the fur fits, wear it.

995
01:13:43.878 --> 01:13:47.381
A penny saved, pennies from heaven.

996
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:51.302
My favorite credo, oh, ha-ha...

997
01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:58.434
...um, you know, a penny saved, and...

998
01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:00.102
Thank you.

999
01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:07.026
Wow. This feels great.

1000
01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:10.738
Well...

1001
01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.865
...are you gonna go for it?

1002
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.284
Uh-- Here?

1003
01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.411
For starters, sure.

1004
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.581
Why not? Don't you swim?

1005
01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:22.541
Oh, sure. Ha-ha.

1006
01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:27.797
Sure, I took third in the state finals
in my senior year.

1007
01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.758
Yeah, I swim. Heck, yes.

1008
01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:34.178
Oh, yeah, I feel completely at ease
in the water.

1009
01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:36.722
Yeah, I...

1010
01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:38.849
I'm proficient in many strokes and I dive.

1011
01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.978
As a matter of fact,
I could've been in the Olympics.

1012
01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:47.108
Yeah, uh... Yeah, I'll be right there.

1013
01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.276
Yeah.

1014
01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.322
This is crazy, this is crazy,
this is crazy.

1015
01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.702
- How's the water?
- Exhilarating.

1016
01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.956
I'm in deep, I'm in deep.

1017
01:15:06.127 --> 01:15:07.962
Ah! Cold!

1018
01:15:08.129 --> 01:15:11.173
Jesus. Fuck. Ah!

1019
01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:13.426
Clark?

1020
01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:14.844
Cold!

1021
01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:17.388
Jesus! Ah!

1022
01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.064
Clark?

1023
01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:30.151
- Hi, honey.
- What are you doing?

1024
01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:31.485
Uh-- Swimming.

1025
01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:34.947
Yeah, my back was killing me.

1026
01:15:35.114 --> 01:15:38.993
I thought, you know, a good hot swim
would loosen up the muscles.

1027
01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.288
Why go to the car and get
the bathing suit? Jump right in.

1028
01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:44.832
It's exhilarating.

1029
01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:49.045
Guess what, honey?
This person here was here.

1030
01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.589
I didn't see this person...

1031
01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:55.301
...so I screamed, that's why I yelled.
I was so surprised.

1032
01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:57.970
You can imagine, can't you, honey?

1033
01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:02.975
Honey?

1034
01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:15.196
Uh...

1035
01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.990
Will you excuse me?

1036
01:16:18.157 --> 01:16:19.366
If you have to go.

1037
01:16:20.785 --> 01:16:23.579
Well, I'd stay if I weren't married,
but I am.

1038
01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.331
I know.

1039
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:30.336
- I hope I didn't spoil your evening.
- No, it's been interesting.

1040
01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:33.172
Well, enjoy the rest of your trip.

1041
01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:34.965
You, too.

1042
01:16:43.682 --> 01:16:46.018
I can't believe this.

1043
01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:50.231
I am so humiliated.

1044
01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:54.360
Cut it out, Audrey. You don't even know
how to inhale.

1045
01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:55.986
So?

1046
01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:58.280
Maybe I don't want to.

1047
01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.825
You're such a dork, Audrey.

1048
01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:04.495
How can he do this to Mom?

1049
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:07.248
They'll probably get a divorce.

1050
01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.916
I'd better go talk to him.

1051
01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:15.881
- Hey, squirt.
- Hey, Dad.

1052
01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.133
What are you doing up?

1053
01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.261
You woke the whole motel up, Dad.

1054
01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:23.139
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

1055
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.015
I was swimming.

1056
01:17:25.182 --> 01:17:26.433
Yeah, I saw you.

1057
01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.396
Russ, come here a minute.

1058
01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:34.441
Russ...

1059
01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:37.486
...you know I wouldn't do anything
to hurt your mom.

1060
01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.407
It's been a long drive...

1061
01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.742
...and, jeez, I work...

1062
01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:48.080
I work very hard for you
and Audrey and your mom.

1063
01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:54.670
I guess when you get older
you get these feelings...

1064
01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:59.550
...and these feelings make you do things
you wouldn't normally do.

1065
01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.512
- Like swimming naked with girls?
- Yeah. Like swimming naked with girls.

1066
01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:06.432
Well, not with girls.
You think I was swimming with girls?

1067
01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:09.560
It was just one girl. I saw that girl.

1068
01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:10.978
Who, that girl?

1069
01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:13.939
Oh, no, that's a waitress.
No, I was just ordering in.

1070
01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:16.775
She's a pool waitress. I was...

1071
01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:20.362
...ordering some fish for you
and Audrey and Mom.

1072
01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.949
- She took your order?
- She took my order, yeah. Ha-ha.

1073
01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.160
Swimming waitress.

1074
01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:27.953
You understand, don't you, Russ?

1075
01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:31.123
Sure, I understand.

1076
01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.542
Do you think Mom will buy it?

1077
01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.588
Good talk, son.

1078
01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.591
Go to bed, Russ.

1079
01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:42.468
Goodnight.

1080
01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:48.015
Ellen?

1081
01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:53.145
Ellen?

1082
01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.939
Honey?

1083
01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.026
Are you mad?

1084
01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:01.654
No.

1085
01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.324
Do you like that girl?

1086
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.160
Is that what you want?

1087
01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:11.538
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1088
01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.958
How could I like a girl like that?

1089
01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.001
She's ugly.

1090
01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:18.671
I love you.

1091
01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:24.051
I'm sorry about everything.

1092
01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.512
I got angry because you were right
and I knew it.

1093
01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.514
I was hurt, honey.

1094
01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:31.600
I'm sorry, too. It's not all your fault.

1095
01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:33.560
I know you've been trying.

1096
01:19:33.727 --> 01:19:36.021
I'm gonna try, too.

1097
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.858
I know how to have fun.

1098
01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:42.528
And I'm going to prove it.

1099
01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.990
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Ellen? What are we doing?

1100
01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:48.534
Honey, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

1101
01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:52.329
Come on, Clark.
I want us to have some fun together.

1102
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.375
- Come on.
- The water's very--

1103
01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.961
Fuck! Aah!

1104
01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:05.050
Ooh!

1105
01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:07.386
Aah!

1106
01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:12.683
Aah!

1107
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:32.161
We must be getting close.

1108
01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.747
We're almost there.
Everybody just take it easy.

1109
01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.375
Just take it easy. We're gonna be there.

1110
01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:44.548
I know we're getting close.
What is that? What is that?

1111
01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.133
There it is.

1112
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.801
Walley World, next three exits.

1113
01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:51.138
- Dad! Whoa!
- Walley World!

1114
01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.933
We made it, damn it. We made it.

1115
01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:59.188
The Griswolds are one hell
of a family, huh? We made it!

1116
01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:05.402
Don't get too much sun, now.
Watch out. Watch out.

1117
01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:10.532
Oh.

1118
01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.451
It's beautiful.

1119
01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:15.245
It's just beautiful.

1120
01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:18.707
Oh, darling.

1121
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:25.798
- We made it.
- You did it, Clark. Sparky.

1122
01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:28.467
I love you guys. I love. I love.

1123
01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:44.733
Aah. First ones here. First ones here.

1124
01:21:47.861 --> 01:21:49.696
First ones here.

1125
01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:52.157
But we're so far away, Clark.

1126
01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:55.661
Right, right. And at the end of the day,
when the lot's all full...

1127
01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:59.456
...and everybody's fighting to get out,
we'll be the first ones out, too.

1128
01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:05.170
Why? Because we're the Griswolds.

1129
01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.174
Come on, I'll race you.

1130
01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.456
<i>Sorry, folks.
We're closed for two weeks...</i>

1131
01:23:22.623 --> 01:23:27.085
<i>...to clean and repair
America's favorite family fun park. Sorry.</i>

1132
01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:33.342
<i>Sorry, folks. We're closed...</i>

1133
01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.469
Clark. What are you doing?

1134
01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.679
We watch his program.

1135
01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:40.933
We buy his toys. We go to his movies.
He owes us.

1136
01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:42.976
Doesn't he owe us, huh?

1137
01:23:43.143 --> 01:23:44.770
He owes the Griswolds, right?

1138
01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.605
Fucking A right, he owes us.

1139
01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:49.525
- Clark, you're scaring me.
- Don't be scared.

1140
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.569
I just think somebody owes us
an explanation, that's all.

1141
01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:56.990
- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Clark, now just a minute.

1142
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.554
Honey, you wanna check the mileage
for me, please?

1143
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.348
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

1144
01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:23.475
I'm just gonna get some sporting goods.

1145
01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:27.604
Thank you, thank you.

1146
01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:37.447
Clark, will you listen to me?

1147
01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:40.826
Let's just find a hotel. I'll call my parents,
they'll wire us money.

1148
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.495
We can fly home and forget
this vacation ever happened.

1149
01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.165
Honey, relax. I told you I'm not angry
anymore. I'm in complete control.

1150
01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:50.168
I'm sure they're not repairing every ride
at the same time.

1151
01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:53.255
I think they owe us a little explanation
and a little fun, okay?

1152
01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:56.508
Whatever happens, just trust me.
Will you just trust me? Huh, kids?

1153
01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:06.143
Sorry, folks, park's closed.
The moose out front should have told you.

1154
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:09.813
- Yes, we're here to see Mr. Roy Walley.
- What is your name, sir?

1155
01:25:09.980 --> 01:25:12.107
Clark W. Griswold.

1156
01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:16.320
What's this regarding, Mr. Gristle?

1157
01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:19.906
We're here, public relations--
Summer inspection.

1158
01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.326
- Personal matter. Inspection.
- Ah.

1159
01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:29.875
Well, nobody notified
this office of anything.

1160
01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:32.252
Well, I'm notifying you.

1161
01:25:32.419 --> 01:25:34.546
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
more than that, sir.

1162
01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.548
Okey-dokey. How's this?

1163
01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:41.678
Clark, have you lost your mind?
Where did you get that?

1164
01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:44.139
Sporting goods store.
You listen to me, fat ass.

1165
01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.558
Do what I say
and there won't be any problem, okay?

1166
01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:51.063
We just drove 2460 miles,
just for a little Roy Walley entertainment.

1167
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.398
The moose says you're closed.
I say you're open.

1168
01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.026
We're not really violent people.

1169
01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:58.028
This is our first gun.

1170
01:25:58.195 --> 01:26:00.072
No, it isn't.

1171
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.617
- What's going on here?
- You. Freeze. Freeze.

1172
01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.495
Sit! Sit, come on.

1173
01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.373
Lie down. Let's go, lie down.

1174
01:26:10.415 --> 01:26:11.875
Roll over.

1175
01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.835
Stay.

1176
01:26:15.587 --> 01:26:19.591
Okay. Okay. Let's ride.
Let's ride. Come on.

1177
01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.259
Stay.

1178
01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:28.100
Yee-hoo. This is scary, isn't it?

1179
01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:31.436
Make sure you keep your hands
on the handlebars at all times.

1180
01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:34.648
- We don't want any accidents.
- Is that a real gun, Mom?

1181
01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:38.402
I don't know, Rusty.
But when this is all over...

1182
01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:41.196
...your father may be going away
for a little while.

1183
01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:44.950
Boy, I sure am bushed.
Have you had enough yet, sir?

1184
01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.993
What do you mean, bushed?

1185
01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:48.954
Where are the big rides? The big ones?

1186
01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:57.212
Screamie Mimi! Let's go. Get in the front.

1187
01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:58.797
Come on.

1188
01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.799
Huh?

1189
01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.387
Has your father
ever killed anyone before?

1190
01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:08.348
Oh, just a dog. Oh, and my Aunt Edna.

1191
01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:11.852
- Hey. You can't prove that, Rusty.
- Ooh.

1192
01:27:13.854 --> 01:27:16.481
Rusty? May I call you Rusty?

1193
01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:19.401
I had a bad experience
on this ride once before.

1194
01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:20.986
What happened?

1195
01:27:21.153 --> 01:27:22.237
I threw up.

1196
01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:39.921
No, don't do that again.

1197
01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.618
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY

1198
01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.730
Goodie, goodie, goodie! The Loop-D-Loop.
Come on, get in there. Let's go.

1199
01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.108
- Please, don't push.
- Come on, Audrey.

1200
01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.360
Isn't this fun, honey? Come on.

1201
01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.823
That's not a real gun, is it, Clark?

1202
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:32.075
What? Are you kidding?
This is a Magnum P.I.

1203
01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:33.827
It's a BB gun.

1204
01:29:33.994 --> 01:29:36.121
Don't try me. I could
put an eye out with this.

1205
01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:39.791
- You couldn't break the skin with that.
- It could. It could break the skin.

1206
01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.544
It could lodge under the skin
and cause a bad infection.

1207
01:29:42.711 --> 01:29:46.131
- That's an old wives' tale, Clark. I'm telling.
- You're not going--

1208
01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:48.466
- Ooh!
- Clark.

1209
01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:50.302
See, I told you. I warned you.

1210
01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:52.804
If you wrecked these pants,
you're paying for them.

1211
01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.849
Yeah, I'll pay for them.
You'll pay for them.

1212
01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:59.144
- Why did you shoot me?
- It's a BB gun. I told you.

1213
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:00.937
- Well it hurt.
- What do you want?

1214
01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:03.106
- Why'd you shoot me?
- You tried to run away.

1215
01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:05.400
- I wasn't going anywhere.
- I thought you were.

1216
01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:06.902
This is great, Dad!

1217
01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:42.479
- Whoa.
- Ow!

1218
01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:09.506
Freeze!

1219
01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.386
Don't shoot.

1220
01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.055
You, out.

1221
01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:20.058
All right, hands behind your heads.

1222
01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.268
Spread your legs apart.

1223
01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:25.689
And up against the wall.
You two, over there.

1224
01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:31.653
- Just a BB gun.
- You're all under arrest.

1225
01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:33.905
You have the right to remain silent.

1226
01:31:34.072 --> 01:31:37.617
- If you give up the right to remain silent--
- Watch your hands, mister.

1227
01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:39.744
--in a court of law.

1228
01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:47.502
How many are there? A lot of them?
What, five? What, are they Arabs?

1229
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:49.963
Whatever they want, pay them.
We'll pay them.

1230
01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.257
- What's going on?
- We've got it under control.

1231
01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:54.092
- These people are terrorists.
- Where?

1232
01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.468
- There.
- Them?

1233
01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:58.388
- Hello, Mr. Walley.
- He treated me like a dog, Mr. Walley.

1234
01:31:58.555 --> 01:32:01.474
- He humiliated my human decency!
- What did he do with your dog?

1235
01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:04.602
He kidnapped me, but I wanna tell you,
I had a great time.

1236
01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:08.481
It's the most fantastic time I ever had.
I like where I was way up high--

1237
01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:10.984
I'm glad you liked it.
Now, what's happening?

1238
01:32:11.151 --> 01:32:12.777
- That's Roy Walley, honey.
- I know!

1239
01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:14.779
Mr. Walley, my name is Russ Lasky.

1240
01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.782
- I met you at the summer picnic last year.
- I don't remember.

1241
01:32:17.949 --> 01:32:20.368
- They kidnapped my men.
- I was the one who was sick.

1242
01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:23.621
Anyway, I went on all the rides,
and I didn't get sick this time.

1243
01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:26.541
- Normally, I get sick on all your rides--
- Quiet!

1244
01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:32.213
Uh-- Mr. Walley? Roy?

1245
01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:35.216
I think I can make some sense out of this.

1246
01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:37.635
Well, somebody better explain...

1247
01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:40.472
...or there'll be a lot of explaining to do.

1248
01:32:40.638 --> 01:32:43.433
- I'm Clark W. Griswold.
- Uh-huh.

1249
01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.227
And, oh, this is my wife, Ellen.

1250
01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:50.273
Hi. We're really big fans of yours.
We watch your show all the time.

1251
01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:53.109
- Oh.
- And my children, Audrey and Rusty.

1252
01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:56.071
- Nice family.
- Heh-heh.

1253
01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.572
Uh...

1254
01:32:58.156 --> 01:33:01.910
- We're from Chicago, Roy. The Windy City.
- Yes, I've been there many times.

1255
01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:07.165
We just spent two weeks of living hell
driving out here.

1256
01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:10.627
We lost a very dear member
of the family along the way.

1257
01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:14.339
But the important thing, Roy...

1258
01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:17.550
...is that we could've gone anywhere
we wanted to this summer.

1259
01:33:17.717 --> 01:33:19.302
Anywhere in the world.

1260
01:33:19.469 --> 01:33:21.262
But when I asked my kids...

1261
01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:25.850
And I said-- Kids, remember when I said,
"Where would you like to go this summer?"

1262
01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:27.852
- What did you say?
- Hawaii?

1263
01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.355
Shut up, Russ. Audrey, you remember?

1264
01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.024
Uh-- Walley World, Dad?

1265
01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:36.694
Walley World, Dad. Roy Walley World.

1266
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:38.863
I don't imagine you have any children.

1267
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.074
Are you kidding? I have seven.

1268
01:33:41.241 --> 01:33:43.743
I thought so.
Seven, did you hear that, honey?

1269
01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:46.037
You look so young.

1270
01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:48.790
- You do look very young.
- Oh? Well.

1271
01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:50.792
Did you ever drive them across country?

1272
01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:52.168
Oh, hell yes.

1273
01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:56.673
I took the whole clan to Florida one year.
The worst two weeks I ever had in my life.

1274
01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:59.801
The smell from the back seat
was unbearable. You know families.

1275
01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.554
I know that smell. I know that smell.

1276
01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.975
But, Roy, can you imagine
how your kids would've felt...

1277
01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:09.227
...if when you got to Florida,
it was closed?

1278
01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:10.770
Oh, they don't close Florida.

1279
01:34:10.937 --> 01:34:14.983
I know they don't close
the state of Florida. But, you know...

1280
01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:17.569
...when we got here,
to Roy Walley World...

1281
01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:19.904
...and it was closed down, Roy...

1282
01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:22.448
If you had seen the look
on my kids' faces...

1283
01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:25.910
- I just went a little haywire.
- You went a lot haywire, if you ask me.

1284
01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:28.913
Well, I'm very sorry, sir.
And I'm sorry to all these people.

1285
01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:31.291
I didn't mean any harm.

1286
01:34:31.457 --> 01:34:35.044
I just want you to ask yourself one thing.
If you were...

1287
01:34:35.587 --> 01:34:36.880
If you were me...

1288
01:34:37.046 --> 01:34:39.841
...wouldn't you do the same thing
for your children?

1289
01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.343
- No.
- We're all finished here, Mr. Walley.

1290
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:45.138
You want me to take them downtown
and book them?

1291
01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:46.931
Um...

1292
01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:50.476
No. No.

1293
01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:53.062
Forget it, officer.
I'm not gonna press any charges.

1294
01:34:57.609 --> 01:35:01.112
Walley. Good, huh?
What did I tell you? Did I say trust me?

1295
01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:02.947
Huh? Ha-ha-ha.
