00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:07.931
True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

2
00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:09.324
but the shape of your life.

3
00:03:14.242 --> 00:03:16.679
This is such fucking bullshit.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.558

<i>♪ You can say I'm used to it ♪</i>

7
00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:33.305
These white walls create
such mystical notions.

8
00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:35.742
They are undefinably absolute.

9
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.135
I will take this piece
right here please.

10
00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.399
This is such fucking bullshit.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:43.097

13
00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.234
Put the money in the bag!
Put the money in the bag!

14
00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:50.409
Do you wanna play?

15
00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.282
Barry loves to play.

16
00:03:58.286 --> 00:03:59.287
Cut.

17
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:03.987
That was beautiful, Ezra,
truly groundbreaking work.

18
00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:06.120
This is such fucking bullshit.

28
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:28.011
Pack your bags!

29
00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.578
What's the word, Diamond?

30
00:04:29.752 --> 00:04:32.015
Yeah, I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

31
00:04:32.102 --> 00:04:33.452
Yeah, you're about
as busy over there

32
00:04:33.626 --> 00:04:34.888
selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

33
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.412
as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

34
00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.762
Daddy has given us
his jet and villa,

35
00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.984
we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

36
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:45.464
What?
No shit.

37
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.161
That sounds amazing.

38
00:04:47.248 --> 00:04:49.163
Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

39
00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.208
Phuket...

40
00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:53.210
Thailand!

41
00:04:53.298 --> 00:04:54.777
Are you sure it's safe there?

42
00:04:54.864 --> 00:04:57.084
Decap Ezra,
of course it's safe.

43
00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:58.607
Now go pack your shit.

44
00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.348
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

45
00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:02.872
See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

46
00:05:12.578 --> 00:05:14.319
Welcome, ladies.

47
00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:16.495
Now where the fuck is Ryder?

48
00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.324
Oh, of course.

49
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.725
Nice luggage, Ryder.

50
00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:31.074
Fuck off, Daisy.

51
00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:32.249
Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

52
00:05:32.337 --> 00:05:33.555
How do you know I haven't?

53
00:05:36.993 --> 00:05:38.691
Wow, welcome, ladies.

54
00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:40.432
I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

55
00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.737
We have good weather,

56
00:05:41.998 --> 00:05:43.522
so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

57
00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.524
Sit back, relax,
enjoy the flight,

58
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.222
and if you guys need
anything, I'll be up front.

59
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.529
Oh my, I can think
of a few things

60
00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.313
that our captain can do to me.

61
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.881
Diamond, just let
him focus on his job,

62
00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:56.970
which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

63
00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:58.275
Fuck off.

64
00:05:58.363 --> 00:06:00.539
Oh this is fucking awesome!

65
00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:03.542
Enough of the
chitchat, I want a shot.

66
00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.414
God, Daisy, the
sun's barely up.

67
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.895
Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

68
00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:11.985
And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

69
00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.116
To sex.

70
00:06:13.203 --> 00:06:14.117
To drugs.

71
00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:15.510
To rock and roll.

72
00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:24.214
I think we should all
go around in a circle

73
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:27.261
and collectively
set an intention

74
00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:29.089
for our vacay together.

75
00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:32.135
Oh my God, Ezra, stop being
so fucking introspective.

76
00:06:32.222 --> 00:06:33.746
Like, just relax.

77
00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.791
Here, take a pull.

78
00:06:36.575 --> 00:06:39.099
I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

79
00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:41.928
and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

80
00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:43.712
Ryder, what about you?

81
00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.062
I wanna connect
with my friends,

82
00:06:46.149 --> 00:06:48.543
and have the experience
of a lifetime.

83
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.502
That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

84
00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:55.811
I want to eat great
food, sleep long nights

85
00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:59.249
and fuck anyone I want.

86
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.601
Daddy issues.

87
00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:07.301
My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

88
00:07:07.388 --> 00:07:08.824
There is the fucking door, Ezra.

89
00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:13.089
Oh my God, chill out.

90
00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:17.093
Well, I intend to fuck on blow

91
00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.922
and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

92
00:07:20.662 --> 00:07:24.144
To motherfucking
Thailand, yeah!

93
00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:01.877
I gotta piss.

94
00:08:01.964 --> 00:08:03.531
Oh enjoy.

95
00:08:03.618 --> 00:08:05.315
I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

96
00:08:05.402 --> 00:08:07.622
anything I can do
for our captain.

97
00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:11.713
Hey, please don't
fuck with him too much.

98
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.063
I wanna get there in one piece.

99
00:08:22.028 --> 00:08:23.595
Ryder, what the fuck?

100
00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:25.031
I thought we could
use some alone time.

101
00:08:25.118 --> 00:08:26.728
Now is not the time.

102
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:28.600
If not now, then when?

103
00:08:28.687 --> 00:08:30.602
Look, it's not easy, Ryder.

104
00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:32.734
I mean, life is
complicated for some of us.

105
00:08:32.821 --> 00:08:34.040
For some of us.

106
00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:36.564
What's that supposed to mean?

107
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:38.348
Look, I am not you.

108
00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.395
I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

109
00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:48.054
Daisy, you have more
badass in you than you know.

110
00:08:49.055 --> 00:08:50.404
Just go.

111
00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:02.808
This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

112
00:09:02.895 --> 00:09:04.461
The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

113
00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:06.551
The Mile-High, you
asshole.

114
00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:22.828
Get some air in here, Dang.

115
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:24.917
Knock, knock.

116
00:09:25.004 --> 00:09:27.006
Hello, Diamond.
Everything okay?

117
00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:28.747
Everything's great.

118
00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:30.705
Just thought you could
use some company.

119
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:35.318
Uh, Dang, I'm
stretching my legs.

120
00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:36.624
Controls are off to you.

121
00:09:43.152 --> 00:09:46.155
Wow, you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

122
00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:49.071
Uh, yeah, I've had plenty
of years of experience.

123
00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:50.377
I believe it.

124
00:09:50.464 --> 00:09:52.379
Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

125
00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.339
Not personally, but I
am a fan of his movies.

126
00:09:56.426 --> 00:09:59.342
Oh, I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you, Captain.

127
00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:01.170
Mystery? Me?

128
00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:03.782
My life's pretty boring.

129
00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:05.784
I wish I had something to hide.

130
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.568
Married? Kids?

131
00:10:07.655 --> 00:10:10.484
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I'm perpetually single.

132
00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:11.746
Mm.

133
00:10:12.573 --> 00:10:14.880
Well, we might have to do
something to change that.

134
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:19.449
What about you?

135
00:10:20.407 --> 00:10:21.626
Me?

136
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:24.716
Oh well, that's gonna take
at least a second date.

137
00:10:29.634 --> 00:10:31.287
Do me a favor.
Grab a seat, okay?

138
00:10:33.986 --> 00:10:35.552
Are we there?

139
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.771
<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

140
00:10:36.858 --> 00:10:37.946
<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

141
00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:39.687
It's gonna get a
little bumpy, so

142
00:10:39.774 --> 00:10:41.123
if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

143
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.995
We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

144
00:10:43.082 --> 00:10:44.170
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we're not gonna die.

145
00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:45.737
It's just a storm.

146
00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:47.608
Yeah, a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

147
00:10:47.695 --> 00:10:49.479
We're gonna die!

148
00:10:49.566 --> 00:10:51.394
Ryder, I used your toothbrush,
and I never told you.

149
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:54.833
And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

150
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.664
Diamond, I'm so sorry,
but I slept with your dad.

151
00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:03.580
You motherfucker!

152
00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.278
Technically, she's
a fatherfucker.

153
00:11:05.365 --> 00:11:06.932
What is the matter with it!

154
00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:11.066
I just want you guys to
know how much I love you.

155
00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:14.417

Oh, my God.

179
00:12:07.906 --> 00:12:10.952
So here is the pool, there
is the sea, here is the bar.

180
00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.345
Oh my God.

181
00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:13.955
Daddy bought it
like 10 years ago.

182
00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:18.917
so, with a little renovation,
well guys, mi casa, su casa.

183
00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.049
Except for Ezra, that is.

184
00:12:21.136 --> 00:12:22.616
Ha ha, sucker.

185
00:12:22.703 --> 00:12:24.270
I mean seriously?

186
00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:27.012
Fuck you. You're sleeping
in the maid's quarters.

187
00:12:27.099 --> 00:12:29.797
Well they always hide the
good booze there anyway.

188
00:12:31.973 --> 00:12:34.149
- Cool.
- Oh my God.

189
00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:38.588
Here, okay.

190
00:12:38.893 --> 00:12:41.026
I'm not sleeping over there.
I'm sleeping there.

191
00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:01.524
<i>♪ You can run, run, run ♪</i>

192
00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:04.005
<i>♪ You can hide ♪</i>

193
00:13:04.092 --> 00:13:06.529
<i>♪ It's toxic tonight ♪</i>

194
00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.488
I'm skinny dipping tonight.

195
00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:10.838
You're gonna see my
pale ass in this pool.

196
00:13:10.925 --> 00:13:12.057
Your pale ass?

197
00:13:12.144 --> 00:13:14.320
This is the best ever.

198
00:13:14.407 --> 00:13:16.539
This is fucking amazing.

199
00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.498
Yeah, right.

200
00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:22.894
Anyone up for heading into
town to get this party started?

201
00:13:22.981 --> 00:13:24.025
Yeah, thought you'd never ask.

202
00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:25.635
Do they have Uber here?

203
00:13:25.897 --> 00:13:28.943
No need. This place comes
with toys.

204
00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:00.583
<i>♪ Hit and run ♪</i>

205
00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:08.374
<i>♪ Hit and run ♪</i>

206
00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:37.751
This place is so cool.
There's literally fire.

207
00:14:37.838 --> 00:14:39.622
- Guys, I'm gonna go get drinks.
- Okay.

208
00:14:39.709 --> 00:14:41.755
Forget drinks.
Let's find some blow.

209
00:14:41.842 --> 00:14:44.671
Daisy, you need
to be careful, okay?

210
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:46.151
You get caught in
Thailand with drugs,

211
00:14:46.238 --> 00:14:47.674
fast forward 15 years,
you're gonna be

212
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:49.632
like Clare Danes in
Brokedown Palace.

213
00:14:49.719 --> 00:14:50.938
This is Thailand.

214
00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.201
Drugs are just as
accessible as rice here.

215
00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:55.203
Just be careful, okay?
Be careful.

216
00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.639
That's all I'm saying.

217
00:14:56.726 --> 00:14:58.380
You're the ultimate
buzzkill, okay.

218
00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:01.079
Do you understand that?
I'm good, I'm fine.

219
00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.123
Just be careful.

220
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.429
- Oh.
- Oh!

221
00:15:04.256 --> 00:15:05.997
Shots!

222
00:15:06.084 --> 00:15:07.476
Shots!

223
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.277
Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

224
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.200
Ryder,
Ryder, Ryder,

225
00:16:19.287 --> 00:16:21.681
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

226
00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:23.857
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

00:16:23.944 --> 00:16:26.381
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

228
00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:28.688
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

229
00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:30.995
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

230
00:16:31.082 --> 00:16:33.388
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:35.782
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:38.654
Ryder, Ryder, Ryder,

Ryder, Ryder, Ryder!

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:42.745
Here, here, here, here!

235
00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:44.399
Me, me, here, here, here!

236
00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:56.107
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

237
00:16:56.194 --> 00:16:58.196
You enjoying your night here?

238
00:16:58.283 --> 00:16:59.936
Oh you could say that.

239
00:17:00.024 --> 00:17:01.286
Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

240
00:17:01.373 --> 00:17:02.809
with a little something.

241
00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.594
Anything you need on the
island, we're your girls.

242
00:17:06.421 --> 00:17:07.988
I need some blow.

243
00:17:08.075 --> 00:17:09.685
We never touch
that shit anymore.

244
00:17:11.383 --> 00:17:12.427
Oh fuck off.

245
00:17:25.223 --> 00:17:26.876
Okay, Ezra, that's
our cue to leave.

246
00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.357
Hey, fatherfucker,
we're leaving!

247
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:31.664
You fucked your dad!

248
00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:34.971
No, don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

249
00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:36.669
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

250
00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:40.238
Do you know where Daisy is?

251
00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.327
Yeah, she went
in this direction.

252
00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:46.461
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

253
00:17:46.548 --> 00:17:47.810
- Daisy?
- Daisy?

254
00:17:48.594 --> 00:17:50.117
- Daisy.
- Daisy.

255
00:17:50.204 --> 00:17:52.511
She's gone. She's not here.

256
00:17:52.598 --> 00:17:53.903
Where the fuck is she?

257
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.775
Maybe she went
back to the villa.

258
00:17:55.862 --> 00:17:58.952
She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

259
00:17:59.039 --> 00:17:59.996
She's searching from coke.

260
00:18:00.084 --> 00:18:01.650
Ezra, shut up.

261
00:18:01.737 --> 00:18:03.522
Guys, let's just find
her and get outta here.

262
00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:04.740
I'm like done.

263
00:18:06.742 --> 00:18:07.874
Daisy?

264
00:18:09.093 --> 00:18:10.616
Hey, have you seen my friend?

265
00:18:10.703 --> 00:18:12.922
Pink shirt, dreads.

266
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.882
We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

267
00:18:16.796 --> 00:18:18.711
You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

268
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.628
So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

269
00:18:22.715 --> 00:18:24.238
Yeah, not the cheap stuff.

270
00:18:24.543 --> 00:18:26.545
Okay, I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

271
00:18:26.632 --> 00:18:28.068
We're not cheap bitches.

272
00:18:28.155 --> 00:18:29.765
- Daisy?
- Daisy.

273
00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:31.071
Hey, we've been looking for you.

274
00:18:31.332 --> 00:18:32.551
I'm just making a
purchase from these

275
00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:34.640
fine gentlemen right here.

276
00:18:34.727 --> 00:18:37.686
That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

277
00:18:37.773 --> 00:18:40.385
You girls want some party?
Want some company, uh?

278
00:18:40.472 --> 00:18:41.821
No, we don't wanna
fucking party,

279
00:18:41.908 --> 00:18:43.039
and we don't want your company.

280
00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:44.171
Okay, come on,
let's get a move on.

281
00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:45.259
Let's get the fuck outta here.

282
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.782
But it's still
going on inside?

283
00:18:46.869 --> 00:18:48.393
Daisy, okay, time to go.

284
00:18:48.567 --> 00:18:51.352
Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

285
00:18:51.439 --> 00:18:52.658
Oh, fuck you, assholes.

286
00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.007
You're coke dealers,
not missionaries.

287
00:18:54.094 --> 00:18:55.443
Let's go.

288
00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.707
Well. Well, we aren't
coke dealers neither.

289
00:18:58.794 --> 00:19:00.492
Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

290
00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:01.928
all your fucking money.

291
00:19:02.189 --> 00:19:04.757
Look, sirs, you can,
you can have our money.

292
00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.541
Okay, but then just
please don't hurt us.

293
00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:08.064
Please don't hurt us.

294
00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:10.197
You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

295
00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.418
What's going on here?

296
00:19:13.679 --> 00:19:15.159
Jasper?

297
00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:17.813
Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

298
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.988
Oh, I think it is.

299
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.642
Hey,.

300
00:19:20.729 --> 00:19:22.078
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

301
00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.210
Okay.

302
00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:25.473
Remember, you asked for this.

303
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.954
Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

304
00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:33.655
Please, don't shoot, okay.

305
00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:36.397
How did you do that?

306
00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.532
I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

307
00:19:40.619 --> 00:19:43.796
Well, you know,
we had this covered.

308
00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:45.101
Thank you.

309
00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:46.755
Thank you so much.

310
00:19:46.973 --> 00:19:48.366
Look, girls, I know you can
take care of yourselves

311
00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:50.542
but this island
can get dangerous,

312
00:19:50.629 --> 00:19:52.935
especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

313
00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:55.764
You got something
I can write on?

314
00:19:55.851 --> 00:19:57.462
- Here.
- Okay.

315
00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:03.207
If you need anything,
that's where I'll be.

316
00:20:03.294 --> 00:20:06.645
Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

317
00:20:06.732 --> 00:20:08.995
- Let's go.
- Okay, thank you.

318
00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:10.388
Oh my God.

319
00:20:10.823 --> 00:20:12.346
Who are you, Jasper?

320
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.438
I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

321
00:20:17.525 --> 00:20:19.310
Yeah, well you know,
I watched too many

322
00:20:19.397 --> 00:20:20.789
of my dad's films as well,

323
00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:24.315
and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

324
00:20:24.402 --> 00:20:26.621
A simple thank you will do.

325
00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:30.669
Jasper, I don't believe
you. But thank you.

326
00:20:38.938 --> 00:20:40.679
The bags arrived.

327
00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:42.550
Finally, I can get
out of these clothes.

328
00:20:42.637 --> 00:20:44.291
Why, did you like
shit your pants

329
00:20:44.378 --> 00:20:45.553
when your coke deal went south?

330
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.294
Diamond, lay off her.

331
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:50.689
I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

332
00:20:50.776 --> 00:20:52.212
Good idea.

333
00:20:52.386 --> 00:20:53.866
Bring the bags to the
room, put on our suits

334
00:20:53.953 --> 00:20:55.433
and meet you back in five.

335
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.913
Uh uh, uh uh uh, I
wasn't fucking kidding.

336
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.350
You're over there.

337
00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:04.485
Fuck
someone's dad once,

338
00:21:04.572 --> 00:21:07.706
it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

339
00:21:14.582 --> 00:21:16.802
Everybody
get out here!

340
00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:18.456
What the fuck?

341
00:21:20.762 --> 00:21:23.199
Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

342
00:21:23.287 --> 00:21:25.767
I have like 20, okay?

343
00:21:25.854 --> 00:21:29.554
No bikini, no
clothes, no nothing.

344
00:21:31.512 --> 00:21:32.426
Holy shit.

345
00:21:32.513 --> 00:21:33.775
Is that real?

346
00:21:33.862 --> 00:21:35.951
- I know one way to find out.
- Hey.

347
00:21:37.039 --> 00:21:39.085
This bag looks just like mine.

348
00:21:39.172 --> 00:21:40.565
This is nuts, right?

349
00:21:41.522 --> 00:21:43.176
We have to call Jasper.

350
00:21:43.263 --> 00:21:44.656
No, uh-uh.

351
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.528
I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

352
00:21:47.615 --> 00:21:49.704
Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

353
00:21:49.791 --> 00:21:51.489
There is something
off about him.

354
00:21:51.576 --> 00:21:55.188
For all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

355
00:21:56.102 --> 00:21:57.843
You're being
paranoid, Diamond.

356
00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.844
Oh, really?

357
00:21:58.931 --> 00:22:00.541
New pilot, first flight,

358
00:22:00.628 --> 00:22:03.022
we know absolutely
nothing about him.

359
00:22:03.109 --> 00:22:05.677
Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

360
00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:06.939
I mean, he may have
been following us, guys.

361
00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.114
I'm just saying.

362
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:10.072
You know what?
I say we do one.

363
00:22:10.377 --> 00:22:11.683
We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up,

364
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.120
and we just sort
this shit out then.

365
00:22:14.207 --> 00:22:15.948
Just one? Yeah.

366
00:22:16.557 --> 00:22:18.037
Just one.

367
00:22:18.907 --> 00:22:21.736
No, guys, that
is not a good idea.

368
00:22:21.823 --> 00:22:23.303
Just one.

369
00:22:31.703 --> 00:22:33.008
Okay, just one.

370
00:22:33.661 --> 00:22:34.662
Fuck it.

371
00:22:36.403 --> 00:22:38.144
Okay, start it up.

372
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:40.189
I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

373
00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:44.455
so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

374
00:22:46.326 --> 00:22:48.459
Let's turn this shit up.

375
00:22:57.381 --> 00:23:00.645

Oh.

391
00:24:04.622 --> 00:24:06.580
Morning, fuckers.

392
00:24:07.668 --> 00:24:09.235
Morning.

393
00:24:10.018 --> 00:24:12.368
I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

394
00:24:12.456 --> 00:24:13.979
Oh, that can be arranged.

395
00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:16.721
Come on, Diamond, you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

396
00:24:16.808 --> 00:24:18.113
You know it could've been worse.

397
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.333
Yeah? How so?

398
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.510
Well, your dad could have
fallen in love with her,

399
00:24:23.597 --> 00:24:26.557
married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

400
00:24:26.644 --> 00:24:28.472
And then this
would be my house.

401
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.561
Oh my God, you wish.

402
00:24:31.997 --> 00:24:36.044
Anyway, where's our little
bloodhound?

403
00:24:36.131 --> 00:24:37.829
Did she ever get to bed?

404
00:24:37.916 --> 00:24:39.613
I don't know.
I crashed first.

405
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.137
Mm.

406
00:24:42.224 --> 00:24:43.617
Should we go wake her up?

407
00:24:43.835 --> 00:24:46.577
What is the rush, okay?
Just let her sleep.

408
00:24:46.664 --> 00:24:47.882
God.

409
00:24:48.274 --> 00:24:50.363
We have a big day planned. No.

410
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.757
Daisy, we're coming for ya!

411
00:24:52.844 --> 00:24:54.498
Yes!

412
00:24:54.585 --> 00:24:55.716
Come on.

413
00:24:55.803 --> 00:24:58.414
Oh my, you bitch!

414
00:25:10.078 --> 00:25:11.906
Holy fuck!

415
00:25:11.993 --> 00:25:14.169
Oh my God. Oh my God,
what are we gonna do?

416
00:25:14.256 --> 00:25:16.389
What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

417
00:25:16.476 --> 00:25:17.521
I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

418
00:25:17.608 --> 00:25:18.565
Fuck! Fuck!

419
00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:19.914
We have to do something.

420
00:25:20.175 --> 00:25:21.699
Diamond, Diamond,
we have to call the cops.

421
00:25:21.786 --> 00:25:22.874
We have to call
the cops, Diamond.

422
00:25:23.875 --> 00:25:25.093
Jasper, we need
- to call Jasper.
- We need to call your father.

423
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.442
Your father would
know what to do.

424
00:25:26.747 --> 00:25:28.270
Your dad would definitely
- know what to do.
- Shh.

425
00:25:29.924 --> 00:25:32.797
If we call the cops,
she's dead.

426
00:25:33.362 --> 00:25:36.496
If we call my father,
she's dead.

427
00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:39.586
If we call anyone, she's dead.

428
00:25:40.456 --> 00:25:41.849
We need to handle this.

429
00:25:44.504 --> 00:25:45.853
- Diamond.
- We need to handle this.

430
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.159
Diamond.

431
00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:48.726
How are we gonna handle this?

432
00:25:48.813 --> 00:25:50.684
I can't even handle it.

433
00:26:26.677 --> 00:26:28.853
Diamond, this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

434
00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.681
This is real life.

435
00:26:30.768 --> 00:26:32.900
- Get serious.
- I am serious.

436
00:26:32.987 --> 00:26:35.642
If what I say isn't
exactly what happens,

437
00:26:35.729 --> 00:26:37.035
then go ahead, call the cops.

438
00:26:37.122 --> 00:26:38.689
What are you talking about?

439
00:26:38.776 --> 00:26:40.995
We're going to get
a call any minute.

440
00:26:41.082 --> 00:26:43.302
Ezra, you're gonna
answer the phone.

441
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:45.521
Read exactly what I wrote.

442
00:26:45.609 --> 00:26:47.741
And then just, just hang up.

443
00:26:48.786 --> 00:26:50.439
This is not a fucking film.

444
00:26:56.054 --> 00:26:57.359
Answer it.

445
00:26:59.666 --> 00:27:00.711
Answer it.

446
00:27:10.721 --> 00:27:12.200
We have what you want.

447
00:27:14.507 --> 00:27:19.643
But, we also have a very
particular set of skills.

448
00:27:20.905 --> 00:27:24.256
Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

449
00:27:26.301 --> 00:27:29.522
Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

450
00:27:31.176 --> 00:27:34.527
If you let our friend go now,
that'll be the end of it.

451
00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:36.616
We will not pursue you.

452
00:27:37.573 --> 00:27:39.010
But if you don't,

453
00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:41.490
we will look for you.

454
00:27:42.404 --> 00:27:43.754
We will find you.

455
00:27:44.711 --> 00:27:46.887
And we will kill you.

456
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.373
That was fucking
awesome!

457
00:27:55.548 --> 00:27:57.071
You guys believe me now?

458
00:27:57.158 --> 00:27:58.464
Diamond, what have we
gotten ourselves into?

459
00:27:58.551 --> 00:28:00.335
I know, but fuck this.

460
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.860
We're gonna go save Daisy.

461
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.734
Okay.

462
00:28:09.301 --> 00:28:12.434
Okay, let's just break
down what happened.

463
00:28:12.521 --> 00:28:15.611
When the plane landed, somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

464
00:28:15.699 --> 00:28:17.613
with some kind of drug shipment.

465
00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:20.312
Whew.

466
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:22.140
Now, who could have done this?

467
00:28:22.227 --> 00:28:24.795
There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

468
00:28:26.666 --> 00:28:28.581
But Jasper saved us.

469
00:28:28.668 --> 00:28:30.626
No, for all we know,
he was following us

470
00:28:30.714 --> 00:28:32.672
to find the missing bag.

471
00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:36.371
We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

472
00:28:39.113 --> 00:28:42.726
Okay, they come in last night
looking for their product.

473
00:28:42.813 --> 00:28:45.511
They couldn't find it, so
they take collateral, Daisy.

474
00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:49.820
This is seriously nuts.

475
00:28:49.907 --> 00:28:51.604
We have what they want.

476
00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:53.649
Well, they have what we want.

477
00:28:53.737 --> 00:28:55.260
Who is they?

478
00:28:55.347 --> 00:28:56.957
It's a golden triangle.

479
00:28:57.697 --> 00:28:59.612
What is a golden triangle?

480
00:28:59.699 --> 00:29:01.570
It's the area where
the borders of Laos,

481
00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:03.659
Myanmar and Thailand meet.

482
00:29:03.747 --> 00:29:06.053
One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions,

483
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.535
and, guys, we've just
fucked with the balance

484
00:29:09.622 --> 00:29:11.493
of the Thai's drug cartel.

485
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.582
Oh shit! Oh fuck.

486
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.975
Oh my God.

487
00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:18.544
So what's our next move?

488
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:20.546
They will contact us
and deliver instructions

489
00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.591
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

490
00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:25.725
Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

491
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.294
Diamond, this is all just
like a little bit too much,

492
00:29:29.381 --> 00:29:31.557
but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

493
00:29:31.644 --> 00:29:34.734
makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

494
00:29:34.821 --> 00:29:38.042
to, you know, do a
hostage rescue situation.

495
00:29:38.129 --> 00:29:40.000
Yeah, I'm with her.

496
00:29:40.087 --> 00:29:41.741
You have to believe me.

497
00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:44.396
I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe,

498
00:29:44.483 --> 00:29:45.745
but at this point,

499
00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:49.749
the only ones that
are going to be able

500
00:29:49.836 --> 00:29:52.317
to do this are the three of us.

501
00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:56.930
I do have one
question, though.

502
00:29:57.017 --> 00:29:58.279
Yeah, so do I.

503
00:29:58.497 --> 00:30:00.368
- Where's the blow?
- Where's the cocaine?

504
00:30:01.935 --> 00:30:03.067
Follow me.

505
00:30:14.034 --> 00:30:15.862
What is this?

506
00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:17.472
Panic room.

507
00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:19.735
Okay, so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

508
00:30:20.693 --> 00:30:22.738
Because this is like
a totally normal thing

509
00:30:22.826 --> 00:30:24.828
that one has in
the house, right?

510
00:30:27.613 --> 00:30:28.570
What up?

511
00:30:28.657 --> 00:30:30.485
This is fucking awesome.

512
00:30:30.572 --> 00:30:32.836
That's a lot of guns.

513
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:34.794
What is that?

514
00:30:34.925 --> 00:30:37.710
Oh, that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

515
00:30:37.797 --> 00:30:40.365
This is fucking badass!

516
00:30:40.974 --> 00:30:42.584
Okay, why does Daddy...

517
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.501
What does your daddy
have one of these?

518
00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:50.114
Uh, because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

519
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:52.203
He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

520
00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:53.944
Like, gives him peace of mind.

521
00:30:55.249 --> 00:30:57.338
And here it is.

522
00:30:57.817 --> 00:30:59.775
No one knows about this room.

523
00:30:59.863 --> 00:31:02.213
There is no way of
finding it, tracking it.

524
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.692
It's basically invisible.

525
00:31:05.738 --> 00:31:06.782
Diamond, what are we gonna do?

526
00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.699
We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

527
00:31:10.786 --> 00:31:12.397
We don't alert anyone.

528
00:31:12.484 --> 00:31:13.877
They will find us and
deliver instructions

529
00:31:13.964 --> 00:31:15.443
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

530
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.706
Okay, and then what next?

531
00:31:17.793 --> 00:31:21.232
Then the shit, all gets real.

532
00:31:23.451 --> 00:31:25.976
Who fucking has one of these?

533
00:31:26.063 --> 00:31:27.673
I bail.

534
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.772
There's so many people.

535
00:31:39.859 --> 00:31:41.861
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

536
00:31:41.948 --> 00:31:43.558
Three beers please.

537
00:31:43.819 --> 00:31:46.170
Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

538
00:31:46.257 --> 00:31:47.911
By staying calm.

539
00:31:47.998 --> 00:31:49.608
I'm so stressed out.

540
00:31:49.738 --> 00:31:52.872
Look, if it was just one of us,
we would be in deep shit.

541
00:31:52.959 --> 00:31:56.093
If it was just two of us,
we would be totally fucked.

542
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.051
But the three of us together,

543
00:31:58.138 --> 00:32:01.098
we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

544
00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.708
How do you figure?

545
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:06.930
We have the brains,
the body and the bimbo.

546
00:32:07.626 --> 00:32:09.323
Go on, yeah.

547
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.196
I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

548
00:32:12.283 --> 00:32:15.503
I know these guys, what
they think, how they plan.

549
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.636
I know their moves
before they do.

550
00:32:17.723 --> 00:32:19.333
I'm the brains.

551
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:21.814
Ryder, you are the body.

552
00:32:21.901 --> 00:32:23.642
Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

553
00:32:23.729 --> 00:32:26.514
is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

554
00:32:26.601 --> 00:32:28.168
on those extreme sporty things

555
00:32:28.255 --> 00:32:30.344
gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

556
00:32:30.431 --> 00:32:33.478
When we need some
physical action, it's you.

557
00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:36.568
Oh, so that
makes me the bimbo.

558
00:32:38.526 --> 00:32:40.485
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

559
00:32:40.572 --> 00:32:42.313
It means, you're an actor.

560
00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.837
You're our voice.

561
00:32:44.924 --> 00:32:47.579
The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

562
00:32:49.624 --> 00:32:53.280
Yeah, I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

563
00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:54.586
I'm literally panicking.

564
00:32:55.717 --> 00:32:57.110
Chill.

565
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:04.683
What did he say?

566
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.206
Fuck do I know?

567
00:33:10.384 --> 00:33:13.997
The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

568
00:33:14.084 --> 00:33:15.520
No they're not.
They're like wilted.

569
00:33:15.607 --> 00:33:17.870
Buy the flowers.
Buy them now, buy them.

570
00:33:17.957 --> 00:33:19.306
Oh shit.

571
00:33:19.393 --> 00:33:20.525
Uh.

572
00:33:22.135 --> 00:33:23.745
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

573
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:30.404
What do we do?

574
00:33:30.491 --> 00:33:31.579
Open it.

575
00:33:31.666 --> 00:33:32.711
Carefully.

576
00:33:32.798 --> 00:33:33.929
Me?

577
00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:35.583
I don't want to.

578
00:33:36.671 --> 00:33:37.716
Could be a bomb.

579
00:33:37.803 --> 00:33:39.674
- Shut up.
- Just do it.

580
00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:44.679
What is it?

581
00:33:44.766 --> 00:33:46.507
Oh, shit.

582
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:48.857
Come over.

583
00:33:52.992 --> 00:33:55.690
- Turn it on.
- No, no. No.

584
00:33:56.691 --> 00:33:58.606
Turn it on carefully.

585
00:34:13.186 --> 00:34:15.319
This here is a banana spider.

586
00:34:16.885 --> 00:34:20.019
It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

587
00:34:20.672 --> 00:34:22.630
There is no antivenom.

588
00:34:22.717 --> 00:34:25.024
So I suggest that
you don't move.

589
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.900
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

590
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.861
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

591
00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:36.992
<i>There we go.</i>

592
00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:48.569
Okay. Listen to me carefully.

593
00:34:49.657 --> 00:34:52.921
<i>Go to the Fountain
Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

594
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:56.577
<i>There you will see
a big banyan tree.</i>

595
00:34:56.664 --> 00:34:59.928
<i>Be on the bench next
to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

596
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:03.367
Bring the product, and
I'll bring your friend.

597
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.117
Oh my God. Oh my God.

598
00:35:14.204 --> 00:35:15.683
This is so fucked up.

599
00:35:17.337 --> 00:35:20.601
If anything happens to Daisy,
if anything happens--

600
00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:22.081
She will be fine.

601
00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:23.952
Okay.

602
00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:26.564
She is really strong.

603
00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:29.088
Okay, we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

604
00:35:30.176 --> 00:35:32.135
by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

605
00:35:32.222 --> 00:35:35.355
and we can get
the fuck out of here.

606
00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:40.055
She's right.

607
00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:43.233
Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

608
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.799
Oh my God, Ezra.

609
00:35:44.886 --> 00:35:46.758
I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

610
00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:48.107
Come on.

611
00:36:05.037 --> 00:36:07.126
We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

612
00:36:07.213 --> 00:36:08.693
Always be prepared
for the worst.

613
00:36:09.781 --> 00:36:10.869
Yeah, and what's that?

614
00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:13.785
These guys don't
give a shit about us.

615
00:36:13.872 --> 00:36:15.917
As soon as they get
their stuff back,

616
00:36:16.004 --> 00:36:18.224
we no longer have
any value to them.

617
00:36:18.311 --> 00:36:20.052
We can't trust
anything they say.

618
00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:21.967
They will try to cheat us.

619
00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:25.231
And then what?

620
00:36:25.318 --> 00:36:26.624
Plan B.

621
00:36:26.711 --> 00:36:28.582
What's Plan B?

622
00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:31.237
That is a very good
question I don't have

623
00:36:31.324 --> 00:36:33.065
the answer to right now.

624
00:36:33.152 --> 00:36:36.590
Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder,
you will do the drop.

625
00:36:36.677 --> 00:36:39.027
Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

626
00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:41.073
everything that's going on.

627
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.596
We'll be your eyes and ears.

628
00:36:43.728 --> 00:36:44.946
Eyes and ears.

629
00:36:47.514 --> 00:36:48.559
So what next?

630
00:36:49.777 --> 00:36:50.952
Target practice.

631
00:36:52.084 --> 00:36:54.173
Are you fucking kidding me?

632
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.696
Okay, ladies, now,

633
00:36:55.783 --> 00:36:58.395
the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

634
00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.788
is your breath.

635
00:37:00.875 --> 00:37:02.703
Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

636
00:37:04.662 --> 00:37:07.795
Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

637
00:37:09.754 --> 00:37:12.104
You need to be gentle.

638
00:37:12.191 --> 00:37:15.194
Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

639
00:37:20.199 --> 00:37:21.722
Why doesn't that surprise me?

640
00:37:21.809 --> 00:37:24.159
Years of working on
that bullshit cop show,

641
00:37:24.247 --> 00:37:25.900
and still nothing
to show for it.

642
00:37:25.987 --> 00:37:28.729
Okay, let me make
this easy for you.

643
00:37:28.816 --> 00:37:30.731
Hold the rifle steadily.

644
00:37:30.818 --> 00:37:33.865
Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

645
00:37:33.952 --> 00:37:35.649
Relax your body.

646
00:37:35.736 --> 00:37:38.391
Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

647
00:37:38.478 --> 00:37:39.610
And fire.

648
00:37:43.788 --> 00:37:45.050
Okay.

649
00:37:45.659 --> 00:37:47.966
Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

650
00:37:48.053 --> 00:37:49.968
Like what, what makes
you such an expert

651
00:37:50.055 --> 00:37:52.884
on this, Diamond, like
playing with your dad's toys?

652
00:37:52.971 --> 00:37:54.407
Dad's toys?

653
00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:03.764
Yeah, I suppose so.
Get some sleep, ladies.

654
00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:14.645
Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

655
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.736
It's showtime.

656
00:38:18.823 --> 00:38:20.564
Yeah, but can we please,
like, be careful?

657
00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:22.957
Yeah, sure.
Whatever, Mom.

658
00:38:23.044 --> 00:38:24.350
What's in the bag?

659
00:38:25.873 --> 00:38:27.397
More toys.

660
00:38:27.484 --> 00:38:28.833
You ready?

661
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.225
Let's go.

662
00:38:31.836 --> 00:38:34.012
She's fucking crazy.

663
00:38:59.646 --> 00:39:02.780
Come to Thailand,
it'll be sick.

664
00:39:02.867 --> 00:39:04.390
It'll be a blast.

665
00:39:04.477 --> 00:39:06.697
Oh Ryder, you're
doing just fine.

666
00:39:06.784 --> 00:39:08.220
<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

667
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:17.403
<i>You look great, by the way.</i>

668
00:39:29.241 --> 00:39:31.069
Shit, there's a phone here.

669
00:39:32.026 --> 00:39:33.245
What do I do?

670
00:39:33.332 --> 00:39:34.377
Answer it.

671
00:39:34.464 --> 00:39:36.596
<i>Don't speak, just listen.</i>

672
00:39:41.906 --> 00:39:43.081
<i>There's a black van that's</i>

673
00:39:43.168 --> 00:39:45.388
pulling into the
square right now.

674
00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:46.693
<i>Look to your left.</i>

675
00:39:52.612 --> 00:39:55.789
<i>Also, there's a trash
bin beyond the tree.</i>

676
00:39:57.269 --> 00:39:58.923
<i>Drop the duffel
bag into the bin,</i>

677
00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:00.838
and we'll let your friend go.

678
00:40:05.364 --> 00:40:06.670
Something does not feel right.

679
00:40:06.931 --> 00:40:08.628
Ryder, just put the
drugs in the trash bin

680
00:40:08.715 --> 00:40:09.803
<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

681
00:40:25.993 --> 00:40:27.386
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

682
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:38.876
It's not her!

683
00:40:38.963 --> 00:40:40.312
Shit, run!

684
00:40:45.273 --> 00:40:46.318
Okay, let's go.

685
00:41:20.134 --> 00:41:21.614
Stop, stop, stop!

686
00:42:19.498 --> 00:42:21.674
Ah! Fuckers!

687
00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:23.241
We are in way over our heads,

688
00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:25.243
and we need to
call the cops now!

689
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:26.723
No cops, Ezra.

690
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.159
Diamond's right.

691
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.161
These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

692
00:42:30.248 --> 00:42:31.858
Payback's gonna be a bitch.

693
00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:34.557
Okay, tough guy, one problem.
We have no leverage.

694
00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:37.342
They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

695
00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.996
Fuck, she's right.

696
00:42:42.608 --> 00:42:43.696
We're fucking screwed.

697
00:42:46.569 --> 00:42:47.874
Holy shit.

698
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:49.746
Holy shit.

699
00:42:49.876 --> 00:42:52.966
Yeah, they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

700
00:42:53.053 --> 00:42:54.968
This was always the first
step in getting her back.

701
00:42:55.055 --> 00:42:57.231
That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

702
00:42:57.318 --> 00:43:00.191
Bold move D-dog,
you gonna tell us or?

703
00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:02.193
I needed you guys
to be convincing.

704
00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.542
Okay, I just, I need a break.

705
00:43:03.629 --> 00:43:05.239
I am so stressed out right now.

706
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:09.156
Wait, if the coke
was here, then--

707
00:43:09.243 --> 00:43:10.984
What was in the
bag I gave them?

708
00:43:11.158 --> 00:43:13.596
Oh, it was just filled with
Ezra's panties, bras and all.

709
00:43:15.206 --> 00:43:16.642
Okay, so are we even now?

710
00:43:16.729 --> 00:43:19.123
Not even.
But we're getting there.

711
00:43:19.689 --> 00:43:22.474
All right, what's next?
Plan B.

712
00:43:24.998 --> 00:43:26.652
What are you thinking?

713
00:43:27.044 --> 00:43:30.264
<i>Of the Thai drug cartel, an
avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

714
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:33.398
<i>Koon has been rumored to be
training his prizefighter</i>

715
00:43:33.485 --> 00:43:37.532
<i>known as Goliath in a
completely unconventional way.</i>

716
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.883
Pause it. Pause it,
pause it, pause it.

717
00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.103
What are you thinking?

718
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.324
Tomorrow at the fight club,

719
00:43:46.411 --> 00:43:48.848
we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

720
00:43:48.935 --> 00:43:50.110
and trade him for Daisy.

721
00:43:50.197 --> 00:43:52.460
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

722
00:43:52.547 --> 00:43:54.549
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

723
00:43:54.637 --> 00:43:56.421
No, I'm down.

724
00:43:56.508 --> 00:43:58.292
I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

725
00:43:58.379 --> 00:44:00.904
Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

726
00:44:00.991 --> 00:44:02.993
Fine, what's the plan?

727
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.778
Ezra, are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

728
00:44:07.127 --> 00:44:08.215
What?

729
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:11.523
Now and then.

730
00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:12.785
Oh.

731
00:44:14.482 --> 00:44:16.136
Go grab your syringes.

732
00:44:16.441 --> 00:44:19.662
Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

733
00:44:19.749 --> 00:44:22.316
Ryder, you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

734
00:44:22.403 --> 00:44:24.057
Fuck yeah.

735
00:44:24.275 --> 00:44:27.452
Okay, it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

736
00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:29.019
Why?

737
00:44:29.106 --> 00:44:30.368
Trust me.

738
00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:32.022
Okay, let's go.

739
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:33.371
Okay.

740
00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:07.622
<i>In our path, he will
be the next undis--</i>

741
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:38.784
I really hope
you don't expect us

742
00:45:38.871 --> 00:45:39.916
to go out with you tonight.

743
00:45:40.003 --> 00:45:42.135
No. I don't want us to go out.

744
00:45:42.222 --> 00:45:43.484
Great, great.

745
00:45:43.571 --> 00:45:44.747
I'm going out.

746
00:45:44.834 --> 00:45:46.052
What?

747
00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:47.401
I'm seeing Jasper.

748
00:45:47.488 --> 00:45:48.707
- Oh.
- You really think tonight

749
00:45:48.794 --> 00:45:50.230
is the time for you

750
00:45:50.317 --> 00:45:52.580
to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

751
00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:56.280
Well, you know, there's
something off about him.

752
00:45:56.367 --> 00:45:58.891
Something he's not telling us.

753
00:45:58.978 --> 00:46:02.329
And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

754
00:46:04.897 --> 00:46:06.551
No, babe.

755
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.119
But for all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

756
00:46:09.206 --> 00:46:11.425
So, you know what they say,

757
00:46:11.512 --> 00:46:14.037
keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

758
00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:18.389
Yeah, you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

759
00:46:19.651 --> 00:46:21.131
Focus on tomorrow.

760
00:46:21.392 --> 00:46:24.699
Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

761
00:46:24.787 --> 00:46:27.485
We mess up, we're all dead.

762
00:46:27.572 --> 00:46:28.878
Don't wait up.

763
00:46:48.723 --> 00:46:51.857
Wow.
You clean up nice.

764
00:46:51.944 --> 00:46:54.338
And you barely
cleaned up at all.

765
00:46:54.425 --> 00:46:56.644
Vodka martini,
shaken, not stirred.

766
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:03.782
So, are you surprised I called?

767
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:05.740
No.

768
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.742
I'm not.

769
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.092
I'm more surprised you called

770
00:47:09.222 --> 00:47:11.094
and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

771
00:47:11.659 --> 00:47:12.704
Funny.

772
00:47:14.488 --> 00:47:16.099
How's the trip going so far?

773
00:47:17.796 --> 00:47:20.146
Mm, could be better.
Could be worse.

774
00:47:21.147 --> 00:47:22.322
Right.

775
00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:26.022
What about Daisy?

776
00:47:27.501 --> 00:47:30.330
Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

777
00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:34.595
Daisy, you know, she's Daisy.

778
00:47:34.682 --> 00:47:37.250
Always seems to
get in trouble, but

779
00:47:37.337 --> 00:47:39.426
always finds her way out.

780
00:47:40.384 --> 00:47:41.385
Cheers.

781
00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:43.256
Right.

782
00:47:45.563 --> 00:47:47.739
What's your deal, Diamond?

783
00:47:48.522 --> 00:47:51.612
I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

784
00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:53.614
you don't allow people to see.

785
00:47:54.485 --> 00:47:56.095
There's always more.

786
00:47:56.182 --> 00:47:57.749
Okay, go on.

787
00:47:59.925 --> 00:48:04.103
Look, everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood,

788
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:05.844
jumping around the world,

789
00:48:05.931 --> 00:48:09.326
they think this life
is a dream come true.

790
00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.719
And in so many ways it is.

791
00:48:13.112 --> 00:48:16.594
But, my mom left
when I was a kid.

792
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:20.990
One night she just
packed up and was gone.

793
00:48:21.077 --> 00:48:22.643
No goodbyes, nothing.

794
00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:28.388
My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

795
00:48:29.302 --> 00:48:31.696
He put all his
energy into his work,

796
00:48:31.783 --> 00:48:34.568
and nothing else mattered.

797
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.180
Not even me.

798
00:48:38.877 --> 00:48:42.098
I guess work became his drug and

799
00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:45.753
then it was success,
and now it's the girls.

800
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.799
Trying to make him
feel young again.

801
00:48:49.366 --> 00:48:52.673
And, in the midst of all this,

802
00:48:53.892 --> 00:48:55.285
I had to grow up on my own.

803
00:48:57.504 --> 00:49:01.552
Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

804
00:49:02.901 --> 00:49:04.163
I think I'm still trying.

805
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:08.646
I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

806
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.608
You wanna take a walk?

807
00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:18.221
Mm-hm.

808
00:49:19.657 --> 00:49:22.268
So, what's your deal, Jasper?

809
00:49:22.355 --> 00:49:23.487
Me?

810
00:49:23.748 --> 00:49:25.663
Yeah, the man
with many questions

811
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.404
and never a single answer.

812
00:49:27.926 --> 00:49:29.145
Um.

813
00:49:32.626 --> 00:49:35.281
There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

814
00:49:35.368 --> 00:49:36.935
I mean...

815
00:49:38.067 --> 00:49:40.286
my parents split
up when I was young

816
00:49:40.373 --> 00:49:44.551
and, careful, my dad
was a New York cop.

817
00:49:44.638 --> 00:49:46.205
Mm?

818
00:49:46.292 --> 00:49:49.774
My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

819
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:53.212
kinda, just like you,
was fending for my own.

820
00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:54.387
Right?

821
00:49:54.648 --> 00:49:56.476
We had enough to
make ends meet, but

822
00:49:57.695 --> 00:50:00.524
pretty much raised
myself, you know.

823
00:50:00.611 --> 00:50:04.397
Don't know if I did a good job,

824
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:07.879
but yeah, flying is

825
00:50:09.228 --> 00:50:11.709
the only thing that
made me feel free.

826
00:50:13.232 --> 00:50:16.975
Flying up there, high
above my troubles.

827
00:50:19.804 --> 00:50:20.892
I guess we have more in common

828
00:50:20.979 --> 00:50:22.372
with each other than we thought.

829
00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:23.547
Yeah.

Fucker.

842
00:52:39.335 --> 00:52:43.208
Wow, well that
was a long drink.

843
00:52:43.295 --> 00:52:44.818
Fuck you.

844
00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:47.865
I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

845
00:52:47.952 --> 00:52:51.564
Did you find
anything out at least?

846
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:55.307
Yeah, I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

847
00:52:55.394 --> 00:52:56.874
Oh, shit.

848
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.746
You have
all the supplies?

849
00:52:59.833 --> 00:53:01.444
Yeah. You got everything?

850
00:53:01.531 --> 00:53:02.880
Mm-hm.
Everything.

851
00:53:03.054 --> 00:53:04.621
You understand exactly
what we're doing?

852
00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:06.927
Diamond, we're fine.

853
00:53:08.973 --> 00:53:11.105
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

854
00:53:12.063 --> 00:53:14.587
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

855
00:53:14.674 --> 00:53:17.199
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

856
00:53:33.998 --> 00:53:36.653
Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

857
00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.656
There is no obstacle
in our path.

858
00:53:39.743 --> 00:53:43.529
He will be the next
undisputed champion.

859
00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:46.097
He is unstoppable.

860
00:53:46.184 --> 00:53:49.666
Another day, and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

861
00:53:52.973 --> 00:53:54.540
Got time for one more?

862
00:53:56.977 --> 00:53:58.152
A woman?

863
00:53:59.415 --> 00:54:01.591
Here's our buy-in.
Ryder, go get ready.

864
00:54:04.158 --> 00:54:06.683
You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

865
00:54:08.685 --> 00:54:09.686
Do you have a name?

866
00:54:09.773 --> 00:54:11.035
Diamond.

867
00:54:11.383 --> 00:54:12.297
Just Diamond?

868
00:54:12.384 --> 00:54:13.733
Just Diamond.

869
00:54:13.907 --> 00:54:15.866
And what brings you to
my country, Just Diamond?

870
00:54:15.953 --> 00:54:17.476
I'm here on vacation.

871
00:54:17.563 --> 00:54:19.391
And how has that been so far?

872
00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:21.785
Pretty uneventful.

873
00:54:22.394 --> 00:54:24.614
We'll certainly have
to change that, won't we?

874
00:54:29.096 --> 00:54:30.359
I'm counting on that.

875
00:54:44.111 --> 00:54:46.288
I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

876
00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:47.680
Tell your friend to go home.

877
00:54:47.767 --> 00:54:49.421
She has nothing to prove.

878
00:54:49.595 --> 00:54:51.554
Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

879
00:54:51.641 --> 00:54:55.514
How about I make
you that same offer?

880
00:55:18.494 --> 00:55:20.670
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

881
00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:22.541
You found it.

882
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.367
The end is near for your friend.

883
00:56:06.411 --> 00:56:08.195
Shall we double the wager?

884
00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:12.069
Diamond, you shine
bright, but clearly flawed.

885
00:57:07.777 --> 00:57:09.256
I've never lost in anything.

886
00:57:15.219 --> 00:57:16.394
Let's fuck.

887
00:57:35.674 --> 00:57:37.241
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

888
00:57:37.328 --> 00:57:39.461
Ryder, grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

889
00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:02.875
Did you really think you
would leave without me?

890
00:58:02.962 --> 00:58:04.224
Get in.

891
00:58:08.402 --> 00:58:10.056
I thought you'd never ask.

892
00:58:13.364 --> 00:58:14.496
Let's go.

893
00:58:18.978 --> 00:58:20.327
Holy fuck, we did it.

894
00:58:20.893 --> 00:58:22.504
My heart's about to explode.

895
00:58:22.591 --> 00:58:24.897
Guys, this is still
so far from over.

896
00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:26.986
How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

897
00:58:27.073 --> 00:58:28.858
Enough.

898
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.699
<i>♪ Please won't you like me ♪</i>

899
00:58:44.656 --> 00:58:47.050

<i>♪ Boy, I'm shameless ♪</i>

906
00:59:17.384 --> 00:59:19.691
Who the fuck are you, girls?

907
00:59:19.778 --> 00:59:21.650
Do you know who I am?

908
00:59:23.216 --> 00:59:25.654
You just signed your death wish!

909
00:59:25.741 --> 00:59:27.873
Come on, we just want to talk.

910
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.832
Shit.

911
00:59:29.919 --> 00:59:33.009
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

912
00:59:33.096 --> 00:59:35.620
Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

913
00:59:37.187 --> 00:59:38.275
Where am I?

914
00:59:38.362 --> 00:59:39.668
Where you are doesn't matter.

915
00:59:39.755 --> 00:59:42.409
Where our friend Daisy is does.

916
00:59:42.496 --> 00:59:43.976
What is Daisy?

917
00:59:44.063 --> 00:59:46.718
Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

918
00:59:46.805 --> 00:59:48.198
And I know nothing of this.

919
00:59:48.285 --> 00:59:49.721
You see, that I believe.

920
00:59:49.808 --> 00:59:51.636
But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket,

921
00:59:51.723 --> 00:59:53.943
have a little vacay,
maybe dance a bit,

922
00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:55.771
drink a bit, fuck a bit.

923
00:59:55.858 --> 00:59:57.990
But that just isn't
happening now.

924
00:59:58.077 --> 00:59:59.296
She's right.

925
00:59:59.557 --> 01:00:01.254
We get back to our
villa on our first night

926
01:00:01.341 --> 01:00:02.821
and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

927
01:00:02.908 --> 01:00:04.562
is full of bricks of cocaine.

928
01:00:04.649 --> 01:00:07.696
Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

929
01:00:07.783 --> 01:00:08.871
And we wake up the next morning

930
01:00:08.958 --> 01:00:10.829
and our friend Daisy is gone.

931
01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:30.544
Silly bitches,
did you not think

932
01:00:30.632 --> 01:00:32.503
that they would
come looking for me?

933
01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.898
Oh sweetheart,
of course we did.

934
01:00:42.992 --> 01:00:44.471
We're over here!

935
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:45.516
Come up here!

936
01:00:45.603 --> 01:00:46.952
Come and get us!

937
01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:48.562
We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel,

938
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:50.521
and he's being held
hostage by three...

939
01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:53.393
Silly, silly bitches!

940
01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:57.354
Oh, you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

941
01:00:57.441 --> 01:01:01.619
No one can hear you, and no
one is ever going to find you.

942
01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:06.102
See, we needed
something more valuable

943
01:01:06.189 --> 01:01:08.191
than coke to get her back.

944
01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:10.715
We needed you.

945
01:01:21.857 --> 01:01:23.380
Oh, your boyfriend's here.

946
01:01:25.861 --> 01:01:27.123
You have a boyfriend?

947
01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:28.820
Sorry, man.

948
01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:34.565
I'm gonna go see what he wants.

949
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:40.049
Jasper?

950
01:01:41.485 --> 01:01:43.182
What are you doing here?

951
01:01:47.578 --> 01:01:49.101
Well you left rather
quickly in the morning,

952
01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:50.581
so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

953
01:01:50.668 --> 01:01:52.322
I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

954
01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:54.237
I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

955
01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:56.979
Diamond, there's something
you should know, okay?

956
01:01:57.066 --> 01:01:59.155
Don't move an inch more.

957
01:01:59.242 --> 01:02:02.419
I will light you up, Jasper,
or whoever the fuck you are.

958
01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:04.029
Diamond, put the
gun down, okay?

959
01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:07.641
Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

960
01:02:07.729 --> 01:02:09.208
I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

961
01:02:09.295 --> 01:02:12.429
All right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

962
01:02:12.734 --> 01:02:13.865
I've been watching you girls,

963
01:02:14.039 --> 01:02:16.041
but I know all about
the drugs, okay.

964
01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.695
Raise your hands.

965
01:02:17.782 --> 01:02:19.436
I'm with the fucking DEA.

966
01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:24.136
The badge is in my back pocket.

967
01:02:25.398 --> 01:02:26.486
Show me.

968
01:02:26.573 --> 01:02:27.966
Slowly.

969
01:02:43.068 --> 01:02:44.200
What the fuck?

970
01:02:50.162 --> 01:02:52.774
They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

971
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:54.123
They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

972
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:56.299
of the golden
triangle for years.

973
01:02:56.386 --> 01:02:57.517
We've got the pilot in custody.

974
01:02:57.604 --> 01:02:59.432
He's been working
with the cartel.

975
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:02.087
Is my dad involved in this?

976
01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:05.569
No, he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

977
01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:07.179
What happened?

978
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.791
We hit some bad air.

979
01:03:10.617 --> 01:03:12.750
Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

980
01:03:12.837 --> 01:03:14.491
The plan was to make
another run to the US.

981
01:03:14.578 --> 01:03:15.971
Look, I don't know.

982
01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:18.060
Honestly, I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

983
01:03:18.147 --> 01:03:20.236
But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

984
01:03:20.323 --> 01:03:21.715
I do.

985
01:03:26.546 --> 01:03:28.940
I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

986
01:03:29.027 --> 01:03:31.029
I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

987
01:03:31.987 --> 01:03:34.206
These are bad fucking dudes.

988
01:03:34.293 --> 01:03:37.253
I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

989
01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:39.211
I do have a contact at the DEA.

990
01:03:40.169 --> 01:03:42.127
He's gonna call the embassy.

991
01:03:42.214 --> 01:03:44.738
Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

992
01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:46.479
No, no fucking way.

993
01:03:47.176 --> 01:03:48.177
What?

994
01:03:48.264 --> 01:03:49.613
We've got this covered.

995
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.745
What do you got covered?

996
01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:54.052
This is the Thai drug cartel.

997
01:03:54.139 --> 01:03:57.447
Well now that you've
been honest with me,

998
01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:59.362
I should probably
come clean with you.

999
01:04:08.806 --> 01:04:10.503
What the fuck is this?

1000
01:04:11.896 --> 01:04:13.419
That's the head of Thai cartel.

1001
01:04:13.506 --> 01:04:14.681
Calm down.

1002
01:04:15.726 --> 01:04:16.770
Calm down.

1003
01:04:17.859 --> 01:04:20.557
D, this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

1004
01:04:20.644 --> 01:04:22.733
Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl, I'm Wonder Woman?

1005
01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.648
No, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

1006
01:04:27.825 --> 01:04:29.566
You actually care, don't you?

1007
01:04:29.653 --> 01:04:31.307
Of course I care.

1008
01:04:31.394 --> 01:04:34.440
Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

1009
01:04:35.093 --> 01:04:36.965
If we can't get Daisy
back on our own,

1010
01:04:37.052 --> 01:04:38.531
do what you need to do.

1011
01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:40.664
But, you know, best-case
scenario, we rescue Daisy,

1012
01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:42.666
you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

1013
01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:46.061
to our lives before
all this mess.

1014
01:04:48.628 --> 01:04:50.717
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

1015
01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.069
You've got 24 hours, okay?

1016
01:04:55.331 --> 01:04:56.636
Oh wait.

1017
01:04:57.637 --> 01:04:59.857
There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

1018
01:04:59.944 --> 01:05:01.424
Yeah, what's that?

1019
01:05:01.685 --> 01:05:04.296
Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

1020
01:05:07.343 --> 01:05:08.431
So cute.

1021
01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:10.824
Anyway.

1022
01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:31.628
Are you trying to scare me?

1023
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:33.847
Are you kidding me?

1024
01:05:34.413 --> 01:05:37.199
Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

1025
01:05:37.286 --> 01:05:39.201
Oh, ye of little faith.

1026
01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:41.681
Muzzle this fucker.

1027
01:05:44.902 --> 01:05:47.339
Oh Ryder, what the fuck?

1028
01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:49.037
You're not the
only one with toys.

1029
01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.343
And it's pink.

1030
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:52.518
Okay.

1031
01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.573
<i>You think there's a game?</i>

1032
01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.705
<i>You must not value
your friend's life.</i>

1033
01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:08.752
Well, I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

1034
01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:10.580
<i>Don't push me, little girls.</i>

1035
01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.147
<i>How do you know she's
not already dead?</i>

1036
01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.671
Oh, because I
have what you want,

1037
01:06:14.758 --> 01:06:15.933
and the only way you're
gonna get it back

1038
01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:17.848
is by giving me what I want.

1039
01:06:17.935 --> 01:06:20.894
<i>And you think you have
leverage? You don't.</i>

1040
01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:23.375
<i>I don't give a fuck
about the coke!</i>

1041
01:06:23.462 --> 01:06:26.465
But, Spyder, it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

1042
01:06:26.552 --> 01:06:28.119
It's the delivery boy.

1043
01:06:32.558 --> 01:06:34.560
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

1044
01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:36.954
Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple, same time.

1045
01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:39.826
You wanna see him alive,
you do exactly as I say.

1046
01:06:44.527 --> 01:06:45.528
Unmuzzle him.

1047
01:06:49.749 --> 01:06:52.448
Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

1048
01:06:52.535 --> 01:06:53.927
Oh, who's the fool now?

1049
01:06:54.015 --> 01:06:55.712
We have no intention
to ever meet there

1050
01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:57.322
or anywhere tomorrow.

1051
01:06:57.409 --> 01:06:59.150
Now, you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

1052
01:06:59.237 --> 01:07:00.456
your goons are
keeping our friend.

1053
01:07:00.543 --> 01:07:01.935
Or what?

1054
01:07:02.023 --> 01:07:03.546
You gonna cut off my finger?

1055
01:07:03.633 --> 01:07:05.113
Mm, something like that.

1056
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:10.509
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1057
01:07:10.596 --> 01:07:13.860
and welcome to the stage,

1058
01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:19.953
Ezra, aka Dirty Mary!

1059
01:07:21.694 --> 01:07:23.479

<i>♪ So, bombs away ♪</i>

1075
01:08:22.973 --> 01:08:28.021
Listen closely. I am the
big bad motherfucking wolf.

1076
01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:30.067
So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

1077
01:08:30.154 --> 01:08:32.417
One chance, right now.

1078
01:08:32.852 --> 01:08:35.638
Or I'm gonna huff,
and I'm gonna huff

1079
01:08:35.725 --> 01:08:38.510
and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

1080
01:08:39.685 --> 01:08:40.730
Ah.

1081
01:08:42.514 --> 01:08:45.256
You better think carefully
about your next word.

1082
01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:59.314
There's a factory.

1083
01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.927
Your friend is being held

1084
01:09:04.623 --> 01:09:05.537
there.

1085
01:09:05.624 --> 01:09:07.235
What else?

1086
01:09:07.539 --> 01:09:10.673
We need location, security and
any surprises along the way.

1087
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.719
Remember, if we
don't find Daisy,

1088
01:09:13.806 --> 01:09:18.724
no one is ever
going to find you.

1089
01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:21.597
Snip, snip.

1090
01:09:24.556 --> 01:09:26.602
Well, finally my bag's here.

1091
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:29.344
At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

1092
01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:30.823
No offense, guys.

1093
01:09:35.306 --> 01:09:37.830
Okay, I never, like,
literally never thought

1094
01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:40.746
I would ever utter
these words, but, Ryder,

1095
01:09:40.833 --> 01:09:43.749
you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

1096
01:09:43.836 --> 01:09:45.316
No.

1097
01:09:45.403 --> 01:09:46.709
With pleasure.

1098
01:09:47.275 --> 01:09:49.973
All right, what about Koon,
what are we doing with him?

1099
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.757
Well for now, he
stays locked away.

1100
01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:53.803
No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

1101
01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.979
We could still
chop his dick off.

1102
01:09:56.066 --> 01:09:58.547
Okay, ladies, let's
get the fuck out of here

1103
01:09:58.634 --> 01:10:00.026
and go bring Daisy home.

1104
01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:01.202
Let me guess.

1105
01:10:01.289 --> 01:10:02.594
No, let me.

1106
01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:03.900
- Toys.
- Toys.

1107
01:10:06.772 --> 01:10:07.904

1125
01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:59.347
Okay, according to
Koon, we're not far.

1126
01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:01.392
The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

1127
01:11:02.437 --> 01:11:04.526
Okay,
let's keep it moving.

1128
01:11:09.052 --> 01:11:10.706
Diamond?

1129
01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:20.498
Diamond?

1130
01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.273
Jesus Christ.

1131
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.320
Diamond, what have you done?

1132
01:12:05.108 --> 01:12:06.544
Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

1133
01:12:06.631 --> 01:12:08.503
and your family down for years.

1134
01:12:09.504 --> 01:12:11.723
Millions of dollars
in resources spent,

1135
01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:15.727
and it's gonna be
these three girls

1136
01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:18.600
who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

1137
01:12:21.342 --> 01:12:22.865
How do you feel about that?

1138
01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:49.152
Okay, you both
understand the plan?

1139
01:12:50.153 --> 01:12:52.460
I extract, you distract.

1140
01:12:52.547 --> 01:12:54.113
Daisy, we're coming for ya.

1141
01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.419
All right, let's move.

1142
01:13:35.764 --> 01:13:38.549
Okay, Ryder's in.
Take your position.

1143
01:13:38.636 --> 01:13:40.638
Make sure to be ready for us.

1144
01:13:40.725 --> 01:13:43.119
We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

1145
01:13:43.206 --> 01:13:45.817
Diamond, I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

1146
01:13:45.904 --> 01:13:49.778
Ezra, let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy, okay?

1147
01:13:49.865 --> 01:13:51.127
Okay.

1148
01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:37.956
Okay, the charge is set.

1149
01:14:38.566 --> 01:14:40.785
Charge is set.

1150
01:14:40.872 --> 01:14:42.352
Charge set.

1151
01:15:46.503 --> 01:15:48.461
Finally, we meet.

1152
01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:49.724
Fuck you.

1153
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.639
Spare the
impertinence, my darling.

1154
01:15:51.726 --> 01:15:54.119
Now, where's Tok Koon?

1155
01:15:54.206 --> 01:15:55.556
He's safe.

1156
01:15:55.643 --> 01:15:57.122
Safe?

1157
01:15:57.209 --> 01:15:59.603
You think you're so
beautiful, so smart.

1158
01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:01.474
You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls,

1159
01:16:01.562 --> 01:16:03.781
you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

1160
01:16:03.868 --> 01:16:05.304
I don't think so.

1161
01:16:05.391 --> 01:16:08.351
You know why?
Because you're nothing.

1162
01:16:08.438 --> 01:16:09.570
You're fucking nothing.

1163
01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:14.487
I would think
twice about that.

1164
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:22.583
I got the cocksucker.

1165
01:16:32.941 --> 01:16:34.333
- Daisy!
- Ryder!

1166
01:16:36.901 --> 01:16:38.076
Ryder!

1167
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:29.475
Ryder!

1168
01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:32.174
Ryder.

1169
01:17:32.435 --> 01:17:33.828
Are you okay?

1170
01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:35.133
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1171
01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.308
I'm fine.

1172
01:17:36.395 --> 01:17:37.832
And what did I tell you?

1173
01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:39.747
I am a fucking badass.

1174
01:17:39.834 --> 01:17:41.139
Yes, you are.

1175
01:17:41.226 --> 01:17:43.794
Daisy, Daisy, I love you.

1176
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:46.101
I fucking love you, Ryder.

1177
01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:55.676
Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

1178
01:18:00.289 --> 01:18:02.683
We're taking our
friend, and once we do,

1179
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:04.859
Koon will be let
out of our custody.

1180
01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:06.599
Why should I believe you?

1181
01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.601
You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel,

1182
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:11.082
and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

1183
01:18:11.169 --> 01:18:13.955
than just three cowgirls.

1184
01:18:14.042 --> 01:18:17.262
You may walk outta here
today, thinking you've won.

1185
01:18:17.349 --> 01:18:18.829
You haven't.

1186
01:18:19.743 --> 01:18:22.572
'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

1187
01:18:22.659 --> 01:18:25.575
It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

1188
01:18:25.662 --> 01:18:28.143
We're gonna find you, catch you,

1189
01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:30.014
and we're gonna kill all of you.

1190
01:18:30.101 --> 01:18:32.974
Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

1191
01:18:33.061 --> 01:18:34.671
that I lick off
your dead bodies.

1192
01:18:36.194 --> 01:18:37.369
Drink this.

1193
01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:40.416
You asshole.

1194
01:18:40.503 --> 01:18:41.678
No!

1195
01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:46.988
Oh my God.
Thank God, you're okay.

1196
01:18:47.075 --> 01:18:49.294
I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1197
01:18:49.381 --> 01:18:50.643
Please tell me you've
done your last line.

1198
01:18:50.731 --> 01:18:52.645
Good to see you too, Diamond.

1199
01:18:53.298 --> 01:18:55.213
Diamond, no!

1200
01:19:23.633 --> 01:19:24.677
Go, go, go!

1201
01:19:40.693 --> 01:19:44.088
I was fucking shot.
Oh, fuck!

1202
01:19:44.175 --> 01:19:45.220
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

1203
01:19:45.524 --> 01:19:46.438
Just keep pressure
on your wound.

1204
01:19:47.048 --> 01:19:48.266
Diamond, I'm really
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1205
01:19:48.353 --> 01:19:49.877
Screw it.

1206
01:19:50.138 --> 01:19:53.054
After this, you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

1207
01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.103
Hasta la vista, bitches.

1208
01:20:15.467 --> 01:20:17.034
Did they get Ryder?

1209
01:20:17.121 --> 01:20:18.644
No, they didn't get Ryder.

1210
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.951
That was motherfucking Ryder!

1211
01:20:28.916 --> 01:20:29.917
Okay, we're almost there.

1212
01:20:30.004 --> 01:20:31.048
Almost where?

1213
01:20:31.919 --> 01:20:34.356
God, we've got company.

1214
01:20:45.062 --> 01:20:47.543
Daisy, it's time for
a little payback.

1215
01:20:48.413 --> 01:20:50.459
Just release the
clip, aim and fire.

1216
01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:53.375
You got this, D.

1217
01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:10.131
Fuck yeah!

1218
01:21:13.874 --> 01:21:15.440
Oh, fuck it hurts!

1219
01:21:15.701 --> 01:21:16.877
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

1220
01:21:16.964 --> 01:21:18.617
Just take it easy, okay.

1221
01:21:18.704 --> 01:21:19.575
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1222
01:21:19.662 --> 01:21:20.619
It's jammed!

1223
01:21:20.706 --> 01:21:22.273
Hold tight, ladies.

1224
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:55.654
Ah.

1225
01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.572
You almost fucking
got away with it.

1226
01:22:00.659 --> 01:22:02.487
You almost rode off
into the sunset.

1227
01:22:02.574 --> 01:22:04.663
And what makes you
think we haven't?

1228
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:06.665
Look around you, Cowgirl.

1229
01:22:06.752 --> 01:22:09.451
Remember?
I warned you.

1230
01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:12.019
You sure did.

1231
01:22:16.501 --> 01:22:18.068
Yeehaw, motherfucker.

1232
01:22:25.075 --> 01:22:27.382
All right, everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

1233
01:22:28.905 --> 01:22:30.951
Get down!
Move! Get down!

1234
01:22:32.561 --> 01:22:34.345
Stay down,
motherfucker!

1235
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:18.607
Ladies, welcome aboard.

1236
01:23:18.781 --> 01:23:21.262
I'll be your pilot,
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

1237
01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:56.340
Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

1238
01:23:56.427 --> 01:23:58.560
Actually, yes.

1239
01:23:58.647 --> 01:23:59.952
By the way, when
did the two of you

1240
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.519
start munching on each other?

1241
01:24:02.868 --> 01:24:04.000
Diamond, shut up.
They're cute.

1242
01:24:04.087 --> 01:24:05.654
I mean, they might be in love.

1243
01:24:06.437 --> 01:24:07.873
You're not wrong.

1244
01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:10.485
Seriously, for
better or worse,

1245
01:24:10.572 --> 01:24:12.139
this is the trip
I'll never forget.

1246
01:24:12.226 --> 01:24:14.010
I mean, Ezra just
took a fucking bullet,

1247
01:24:14.097 --> 01:24:16.578
repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond,

1248
01:24:16.665 --> 01:24:19.233
and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

1249
01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.538
she likes more than herself.

1250
01:24:22.279 --> 01:24:25.152
And I, for once,
can be the real me.

1251
01:24:29.243 --> 01:24:31.114
Allow me,
just a little toast.

1252
01:24:31.201 --> 01:24:32.637
Yes.

1253
01:24:34.552 --> 01:24:35.988
There we go.

1254
01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:40.471
Ladies, to an inspiring
group of heroes.

1255
01:24:40.558 --> 01:24:42.952
Heroes? Fuck that,
we are Sheroes.

1256
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.434
Sheroes!
