00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.345
(gentle music)

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:27.261
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.668
(waves lapping)

4
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.243
(upbeat music)

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:47.635

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:50.337

(soft music)

9
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.522
True yoga is not about
the shape of your body

10
00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:09.289
but the shape of your life.

11
00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:13.928
(music stops)

12
00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.329
This is such fucking bullshit.

13
00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:18.833
(upbeat music)

14
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.238

<i>♪ You can say I'm used to it ♪</i>

17
00:03:29.844 --> 00:03:33.047
These white walls create
such mystical notions.

18
00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:35.382
They are undefinably absolute.

19
00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.919
I will take this piece
right here please.

20
00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:40.353
This is such fucking bullshit.

21
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.657

Put the money in the bag!
Put the money in the bag!

24
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.363
Do you wanna play?

25
00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:51.933
(gun clicking)

26
00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.035
Barry loves to play.

27
00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:57.304
(soft upbeat music)

28
00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.040
Cut.

00:03:59.107 --> 00:04:00.575
(alarm ringing)

30
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.578
That was beautiful, Ezra,
truly groundbreaking work.

31
00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:05.913
This is such fucking bullshit.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.081

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.860

(phone ringing)

43
00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:27.602
Pack your bags!

44
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:29.036
What's the word, Diamond?

45
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.606
Yeah, I'm just super busy
here at the art gallery.

46
00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:32.940
Yeah, you're about
as busy over there

47
00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:34.509
selling overpriced
sheets of white paper

48
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.911
as I am over here
practicing my Oscar speech.

49
00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:39.180
Daddy has given us
his jet and villa,

50
00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:43.818
we take off tomorrow for an
insta trip you won't forget.

51
00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:45.186
What?
No shit.

52
00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:46.721
That sounds amazing.

53
00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:48.956
Which one of your daddy's
houses are we going to?

54
00:04:49.857 --> 00:04:50.992
Phuket...

55
00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:52.994
Thailand!

56
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.427
Are you sure it's safe there?

57
00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.898
Decap Ezra,
of course it's safe.

58
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.298
Now go pack your shit.

59
00:04:58.365 --> 00:05:00.101
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

60
00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:02.737
See y'all on a G tomorrow.
Diamond out.

61
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.404
(computer pinging)

62
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.708
(upbeat music)

63
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.081
Welcome, ladies.

64
00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.217
Now where the fuck is Ryder?

65
00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:17.852
(engine gunning)

66
00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.086
Oh, of course.

67
00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:24.491
(upbeat pulsing music)

68
00:05:28.162 --> 00:05:29.396
Nice luggage, Ryder.

69
00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:30.665
Fuck off, Daisy.

70
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.033
Oh you would
love to fuck Daisy.

71
00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.501
How do you know I haven't?

72
00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:38.371
Wow, welcome, ladies.

73
00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.174
I'm Jasper McDaniel.
I'll be your pilot.

74
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.408
We have good weather,

75
00:05:41.609 --> 00:05:43.244
so we should be arriving
in Phuket on time.

76
00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:45.012
Sit back, relax,
enjoy the flight,

77
00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:47.782
and if you guys need
anything, I'll be up front.

78
00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.251
Oh my, I can think
of a few things

79
00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:51.886
that our captain can do to me.

80
00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:54.522
Diamond, just let
him focus on his job,

81
00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:56.824
which is literally making
sure we don't crash and die.

82
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.059
Fuck off.

83
00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.027
Oh this is fucking awesome!

84
00:06:00.094 --> 00:06:03.264
Enough of the
chitchat, I want a shot.

85
00:06:03.331 --> 00:06:05.933
God, Daisy, the
sun's barely up.

86
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.536
Well I'm sure the sun
is up in Thailand by now.

87
00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:11.839
And I'm just pro-actively
curing future jet lag.

88
00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:12.940
To sex.

89
00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:13.941
To drugs.

90
00:06:14.008 --> 00:06:15.243
To rock and roll.

91
00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:17.311
(women cheering)

92
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:20.147
(upbeat pulsing music)

93
00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.784
I think we should all
go around in a circle

94
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:27.054
and collectively
set an intention

95
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.689
for our vacay together.

96
00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:31.959
Oh my God, Ezra, stop being
so fucking introspective.

97
00:06:32.026 --> 00:06:33.426
Like, just relax.

98
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.462
Here, take a pull.

99
00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:38.699
I wanna get into some
of that full moon powder

100
00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:41.569
and turn this beach
trip into a ski trip.

101
00:06:41.636 --> 00:06:43.403
Ryder, what about you?

102
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.673
I wanna connect
with my friends,

103
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.276
and have the experience
of a lifetime.

104
00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:50.011
That sounds
pretty fucking lame.

105
00:06:50.077 --> 00:06:55.482
I want to eat great
food, sleep long nights

106
00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:59.053
and fuck anyone I want.

107
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.255
(bubbling)

108
00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:02.323
Daddy issues.

109
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.624
(Daisy laughing)

110
00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:06.861
My daddy has issues
with you on his plane.

111
00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.729
There is the fucking door, Ezra.

112
00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:12.700
Oh my God, chill out (laughs).

113
00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:16.704
Well, I intend to fuck on blow

114
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.807
and have an experience
that we'll never forget.

115
00:07:20.374 --> 00:07:23.978
To motherfucking
Thailand, yeah!

116
00:07:28.182 --> 00:07:29.817
(upbeat pulsing music)

117
00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:33.087
(indistinct singing)

118
00:07:37.058 --> 00:07:40.061
(singer vocalizing)

119
00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:47.234
(indistinct singing)

120
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:50.470
(upbeat pulsing music)

121
00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:57.511
(engine roaring)

122
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.549
[Daisy] I gotta piss.

123
00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.050
Oh enjoy.

124
00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:04.919
I'm gonna go up front
to see if there's

125
00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:07.588
anything I can do
for our captain.

126
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:11.425
Hey, please don't
fuck with him too much.

127
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.928
I wanna get there in one piece.

128
00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:16.597
(soft music)

129
00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:23.104
Ryder, what the fuck?

130
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.672
I thought we could
use some alone time.

131
00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:26.674
Now is not the time.

132
00:08:27.174 --> 00:08:28.342
If not now, then when?

133
00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.111
Look, it's not easy, Ryder.

134
00:08:30.177 --> 00:08:32.446
I mean, life is
complicated for some of us.

135
00:08:32.513 --> 00:08:33.914
For some of us.

136
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:36.317
What's that supposed to mean?

137
00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.918
Look, I am not you.

138
00:08:37.985 --> 00:08:41.188
I'm not all confident wrapped
up in this badassness.

139
00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:47.928
Daisy, you have more
badass in you than you know.

140
00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.197
Just go.

141
00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:53.934
(Ryder sighing)

142
00:08:58.305 --> 00:08:59.740
(upbeat pulsing music)

143
00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:02.511
This is a club I
thought I'd never join.

144
00:09:02.576 --> 00:09:04.011
The Bang Your
Best Friend Club.

145
00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:06.313
The Mile-High, you
asshole (laughs).

146
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.283
(upbeat pulsing music)

147
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:12.486
(indistinct singing)

148
00:09:12.553 --> 00:09:15.623
(singer vocalizing)

149
00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:22.763
Get some air in here, Dang.

150
00:09:23.532 --> 00:09:24.598
[Diamond] Knock, knock.

151
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:26.667
Hello, Diamond.
Everything okay?

152
00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:28.235
Everything's great.

153
00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:30.438
Just thought you could
use some company.

154
00:09:31.038 --> 00:09:35.142
Uh, Dang, I'm
stretching my legs.

155
00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:36.610
Controls are off to you.

156
00:09:37.478 --> 00:09:40.815
(soft piano music)

157
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:45.786
Wow, you girls really
know how to trash a plane.

158
00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:48.722
Uh, yeah, I've had plenty
of years of experience.

159
00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:49.957
I believe it.

160
00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:52.193
Mm-hm.
So you know my dad?

161
00:09:52.893 --> 00:09:55.930
Not personally, but I
am a fan of his movies.

162
00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:59.166
Oh, I'm sensing a little bit
of mystery to you, Captain.

163
00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:01.035
Mystery? Me?

164
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.505
My life's pretty boring.

165
00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:05.507
I wish I had something to hide.

166
00:10:05.574 --> 00:10:07.108
Married? Kids?

167
00:10:07.174 --> 00:10:10.277
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
I'm perpetually single.

168
00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:11.479
Mm.

169
00:10:12.113 --> 00:10:14.815
Well, we might have to do
something to change that.

170
00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.253
What about you?

171
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:21.155
Me?

172
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.458
Oh well, that's gonna take
at least a second date.

173
00:10:24.526 --> 00:10:27.061
(thunder rumbling)

174
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:29.096
(plane jolting)

175
00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:30.898
Do me a favor.
Grab a seat, okay?

176
00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:33.602
(alarm dinging)
(plane jolting)

177
00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.102
Are we there?
(intercom dinging)

178
00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:36.505
[Jasper]
<i>Okay, ladies,</i>

179
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:37.638
<i>we hit some inclement weather.</i>

180
00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:39.206
It's gonna get a
little bumpy, so

181
00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:40.774
if you could please
buckle your seat belts.

182
00:10:40.841 --> 00:10:42.676
We're gonna crash.
We're all gonna die!

183
00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:43.811
Hey, hey, hey, guys,
we're not gonna die.

184
00:10:43.878 --> 00:10:45.246
It's just a storm.

185
00:10:45.346 --> 00:10:47.381
Yeah, a storm we're right
in the fucking middle of.

186
00:10:47.448 --> 00:10:49.049
We're gonna die!

187
00:10:49.116 --> 00:10:50.985
Ryder, I used your toothbrush,
and I never told you.

188
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:54.321
And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked
in the back of your car.

189
00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:59.426
Diamond, I'm so sorry,
but I slept with your dad.

190
00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:01.829
(storm raging)

191
00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.130
You motherfucker!

192
00:11:03.197 --> 00:11:04.899
Technically, she's
a fatherfucker.

193
00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:06.400
What is the matter with it!

194
00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:10.971
I just want you guys to
know how much I love you.

00:13:17.931 --> 00:13:22.637
Anyone up for heading into
town to get this party started?

246
00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:23.738
Yeah, thought you'd never ask.

247
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:25.205
Do they have Uber here?

248
00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:28.909
No need. This place comes
with toys (clicks tongue).

Guys, I'm gonna go get drinks.
Okay.

262
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.315
Forget drinks.
Let's find some blow.

263
00:14:41.382 --> 00:14:44.251
Daisy, you need
to be careful, okay?

264
00:14:44.318 --> 00:14:45.620
You get caught in
Thailand with drugs,

265
00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:47.254
fast forward 15 years,
you're gonna be

266

like Clare Danes in
Brokedown Palace.

267
00:14:49.524 --> 00:14:50.457
This is Thailand.

268
00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.893
Drugs are just as
accessible as rice here.

269
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.895
Just be careful, okay?
Be careful.

270

That's all I'm saying.

You're the ultimate
buzzkill, okay.

272
00:14:58.098 --> 00:15:00.802
Do you understand that?
I'm good, I'm fine.

273
00:15:00.869 --> 00:15:01.836
Just be careful.

00:15:01.902 --> 00:15:03.303

Oh you could say that.

306
00:16:59.587 --> 00:17:00.989
Well, I was wondering
if you could help me

307
00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:02.389
with a little something.

308
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:05.459
Anything you need on the
island, we're your girls.

309
00:17:06.093 --> 00:17:07.529
I need some blow.

310
00:17:07.595 --> 00:17:09.531
We never touch
that shit anymore.

311
00:17:11.064 --> 00:17:12.332
Oh fuck off.

314
00:17:24.712 --> 00:17:26.446
Okay, Ezra, that's
our cue to leave.

315
00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:29.283
Hey, fatherfucker,
we're leaving!

316
00:17:29.751 --> 00:17:31.285
You fucked your dad!

317
00:17:31.351 --> 00:17:34.756
No, don't be silly.
I fucked her dad.

318
00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:36.524
Oh my God.
Oh.

319
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.961
Do you know where Daisy is?

320
00:17:40.028 --> 00:17:42.262
Yeah, she went
in this direction.

321
00:17:44.832 --> 00:17:46.133
Daisy.
Daisy.

322
00:17:46.199 --> 00:17:47.635

Daisy.
Daisy.

She's gone. She's not here.

325
00:17:52.239 --> 00:17:53.473
Where the fuck is she?

326
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.375
Maybe she went
back to the villa.

327
00:17:55.442 --> 00:17:58.746
She has no idea where the
villa is. She must be here.

328
00:17:58.813 --> 00:17:59.781
She's searching from coke.

329
00:17:59.847 --> 00:18:01.281
Ezra, shut up.

330
00:18:01.348 --> 00:18:03.183
Guys, let's just find
her and get outta here.

331
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:04.586
I'm like done.

332
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:07.689
Daisy?

333
00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:10.257
Hey, have you seen my friend?

334
00:18:10.324 --> 00:18:12.492
Pink shirt, dreads.

335
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.697
We just saw her walk out with
two big Thai motherfuckers.

336
00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:18.566
You ever heard of
having a girl's back?

337
00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:21.134
(upbeat music)

338
00:18:21.201 --> 00:18:22.269
So basically I'm
just looking for coke.

339
00:18:22.336 --> 00:18:23.738
Yeah, not the cheap stuff.

340
00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:26.206
Okay, I need the expensive
stuff for me and my friends.

341
00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:27.842
We're not cheap bitches.

342
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:29.376
Daisy?
Daisy.

343
00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:30.612
Hey, we've been looking for you.

344
00:18:30.812 --> 00:18:32.212
I'm just making a
purchase from these

345
00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.048
fine gentlemen right here.

346
00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.317
That description seems to
be a slight embellishment.

347
00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:40.088
You girls want some party?
Want some company, uh?

348
00:18:40.153 --> 00:18:41.421
No, we don't wanna
fucking party,

349
00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:42.590
and we don't want your company.

350
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.925
Okay, come on,
let's get a move on.

351
00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:44.993
Let's get the fuck outta here.

352
00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:46.393
But it's still
going on inside?

353
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.862
Daisy, okay, time to go.

354
00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:51.065
Why you be so rude?
We just try to help you out.

355
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:52.299
Oh, fuck you, assholes.

356
00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:53.801
You're coke dealers,
not missionaries.

357
00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:55.135
Let's go.

358
00:18:55.335 --> 00:18:58.338
Well. Well, we aren't
coke dealers neither.

359
00:18:58.405 --> 00:19:00.173
Now you rich bitches
are gonna give us

360
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.509
all your fucking money.

361
00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:04.378
Look, sirs, you can,
you can have our money.

362
00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:06.213
Okay, but then just
please don't hurt us.

363
00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:07.615
Please don't hurt us.
(glass smashes)

364
00:19:07.682 --> 00:19:10.183
You guys wanna play?
Let's fucking play.

365
00:19:11.853 --> 00:19:13.121
[Jasper] What's going on here?

366
00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.689
[Ezra] Jasper?

367
00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:17.659
Get the fuck out of here!
This ain't your problem.

368
00:19:17.725 --> 00:19:18.559
Oh, I think it is.

369
00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.293
Hey, (speaks
foreign language).

370
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.863
We don't want
anyone to get hurt.

371
00:19:21.929 --> 00:19:22.964
Okay.

372
00:19:23.031 --> 00:19:25.165
Remember, you asked for this.

373
00:19:25.232 --> 00:19:27.769
Pressing your nose
where it doesn't belong.

374
00:19:28.301 --> 00:19:30.538
(kick striking)

375
00:19:31.973 --> 00:19:33.306
Please, don't shoot, okay.

376
00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:34.876
(punch striking)

377
00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:36.343
How did you do that?

378
00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:40.213
I guess I watched too many
of your father's movies.

379
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.651
Well, you know,
we had this covered.

380
00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:44.886
Thank you.

381
00:19:44.952 --> 00:19:46.420
Thank you so much.

382
00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:48.089
Look, girls, I know you can
take care of yourselves

383
00:19:48.156 --> 00:19:49.991
but this island
can get dangerous,

384
00:19:50.058 --> 00:19:52.760
especially if you girls
are looking for trouble.

385
00:19:53.728 --> 00:19:55.395
You got something
I can write on?

386
00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:57.165
Here.
Okay.

387
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.967
(soft music)

388
00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:02.737
If you need anything,
that's where I'll be.

389
00:20:02.804 --> 00:20:06.306
Pen and paper? This guy is
so old school fucking cool.

390
00:20:06.373 --> 00:20:08.810
Let's go.
Okay, thank you.

391
00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:10.111
[Daisy] Oh my God.

392
00:20:10.444 --> 00:20:12.312
Who are you, Jasper?

393
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:17.151
I'm just a lonely pilot
trying to enjoy his layover.

394
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:19.053
Yeah, well you know,
I watched too many

395
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.420
of my dad's films as well,

396
00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:24.058
and I tend to have a
pretty good read on people.

397
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:26.060
A simple thank you will do.

398
00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:30.330
Jasper, I don't believe
you. But thank you.

399
00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.901
(soft mysterious music)

400
00:20:38.539 --> 00:20:40.340
[Ezra] The bags arrived.

401
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.242
Finally, I can get
out of these clothes.

402
00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.045
Why, did you like
shit your pants

403
00:20:44.112 --> 00:20:45.245
when your coke deal went south?

404
00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:46.814
Diamond, lay off her.

405
00:20:46.881 --> 00:20:50.350
I am so tired.
Anyone else wanna swim?

406
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.753
Good idea.

407
00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.521
Bring the bags to the
room, put on our suits

408
00:20:53.588 --> 00:20:54.922
and meet you back in five.

409
00:20:54.989 --> 00:20:57.759
Uh uh, uh uh uh, I
wasn't fucking kidding.

410
00:20:57.825 --> 00:20:59.326
You're over there.

411
00:21:02.196 --> 00:21:04.198
[Ezra] Fuck
someone's dad once,

412
00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.602
it's like you're
a fucking pariah.

413
00:21:08.503 --> 00:21:11.404
(leaves rustling)

414
00:21:11.471 --> 00:21:14.208
(suspenseful music)

415
00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:16.443
[Ryder] Everybody
get out here!

416
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:18.411
What the fuck?

417
00:21:20.413 --> 00:21:22.984
Don't even freak out
if you forgot a swimsuit.

418
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.418
I have like 20, okay?

419
00:21:25.485 --> 00:21:29.489
No bikini, no
clothes, no nothing.

420
00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:32.160
Holy shit.

421
00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:33.426
Is that real?

422
00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:35.797
I know one way to find out.
Hey.

423
00:21:36.631 --> 00:21:38.900
This bag looks just like mine.

424
00:21:38.966 --> 00:21:40.500
This is nuts, right?

425
00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:42.970
We have to call Jasper.

426
00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:44.337
No, uh-uh.

427
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:47.241
I'm not quite sure that's
our best move right now.

428
00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:49.376
Our best move?
He just saved our lives.

429
00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:50.978
There is something
off about him.

430
00:21:51.045 --> 00:21:54.982
For all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

431
00:21:55.683 --> 00:21:57.484
You're being
paranoid, Diamond.

432
00:21:57.552 --> 00:21:58.485
Oh, really?

433
00:21:58.553 --> 00:22:00.254
New pilot, first flight,

434
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.623
we know absolutely
nothing about him.

435
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.358
Shows up out of nowhere at the
club when we're in trouble.

436
00:22:05.425 --> 00:22:06.794
I mean, he may have
been following us, guys.

437
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:07.695
I'm just saying.

438
00:22:07.762 --> 00:22:09.429
You know what?
I say we do one.

439
00:22:09.664 --> 00:22:11.364
We'll have a night.
Call the cops in the morning
to pick it up,

440
00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:13.701
and we just sort
this shit out then.

441
00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:15.803
Just one?
[Daisy] Yeah.

442
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.872
Just one.

443
00:22:18.539 --> 00:22:21.408
No, guys, that
is not a good idea.

444
00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:23.077
Just one.

445
00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:26.346
(Ryder exhaling)

446
00:22:26.413 --> 00:22:29.617
(crickets chirping)

447
00:22:31.384 --> 00:22:32.854
Okay, just one.

448
00:22:33.386 --> 00:22:34.589
Fuck it.

449
00:22:36.157 --> 00:22:37.725
Okay, start it up.

450
00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:39.760
I'm gonna put this
somewhere safe

451
00:22:39.827 --> 00:22:44.198
so Miss Vacuum over there
doesn't get any ideas.

452
00:22:44.265 --> 00:22:46.033
(bag zipping)

453
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:48.202
Let's turn this shit up.

454
00:22:48.502 --> 00:22:51.105
(upbeat music)

455
00:22:51.172 --> 00:22:53.908

(birds calling)

473
00:23:50.965 --> 00:23:53.367
(water splashing)

474
00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:56.203
(water bubbling)

475
00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:04.111
Oh.

476
00:24:04.345 --> 00:24:06.547
Morning, fuckers.

477
00:24:07.381 --> 00:24:09.050
Morning.

478
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.153
I literally feel like
a truck rode over me.

479
00:24:12.219 --> 00:24:13.654
Oh, that can be arranged.

480
00:24:13.788 --> 00:24:16.424
Come on, Diamond, you ever
gonna cut her some slack?

481
00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:17.959
You know it could've been worse.

482
00:24:18.025 --> 00:24:19.894
Yeah? How so?

483
00:24:19.961 --> 00:24:23.030
Well, your dad could have
fallen in love with her,

484
00:24:23.097 --> 00:24:26.067
married her and made
her your evil stepmommy.

485
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:28.235
And then this
would be my house.

486
00:24:28.302 --> 00:24:30.304
Oh my God, you wish.

487
00:24:31.405 --> 00:24:35.676
Anyway, where's our little
(sniffs) bloodhound?

488
00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:37.511
Did she ever get to bed?

489
00:24:37.578 --> 00:24:39.580
I don't know.
I crashed first.

490
00:24:41.015 --> 00:24:41.749
Mm.

491
00:24:41.816 --> 00:24:43.117
Should we go wake her up?

492
00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:46.320
What is the rush, okay?
Just let her sleep.

493
00:24:46.387 --> 00:24:47.555
God.

494
00:24:47.855 --> 00:24:50.157
We have a big day planned.
[Ezra] No.

495
00:24:50.224 --> 00:24:52.460
Daisy, we're coming for ya!

496
00:24:52.526 --> 00:24:54.261
Yes!

497
00:24:54.328 --> 00:24:55.429
Come on.

498
00:24:55.495 --> 00:24:58.199
Oh my, you bitch!

499
00:24:58.699 --> 00:25:02.103
(group chattering)

500
00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:05.172
(suspenseful music)

501
00:25:09.944 --> 00:25:11.345
Holy fuck!

502
00:25:11.412 --> 00:25:13.547
Oh my God. Oh my God,
what are we gonna do?

503
00:25:13.614 --> 00:25:15.950
What are we gonna do?
What is happening?
What is happening?

504
00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:17.284
I told you we shouldn't
have touched the bag.

505
00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:18.319
Fuck! Fuck!

506
00:25:18.386 --> 00:25:19.587
We have to do something.

507
00:25:19.787 --> 00:25:21.222
Diamond, Diamond,
we have to call the cops.

508
00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:22.556
We have to call
the cops, Diamond.

509
00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:24.725
Jasper, we need
to call Jasper.
We need to call your father.

510
00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:25.993
Your father would
know what to do.

511
00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:28.095
Your dad would definitely
know what to do.
Shh.

512
00:25:29.597 --> 00:25:32.500
If we call the cops,
she's dead.

513
00:25:32.933 --> 00:25:36.270
If we call my father,
she's dead.

514
00:25:36.337 --> 00:25:39.573
If we call anyone, she's dead.

515
00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:41.776
We need to handle this.

516
00:25:44.045 --> 00:25:45.546
Diamond.
We need to handle this.

517
00:25:45.613 --> 00:25:46.781
[Ryder] Diamond.

518
00:25:46.847 --> 00:25:48.449
How are we gonna handle this?

519
00:25:48.517 --> 00:25:50.418
I can't even handle it.

520
00:25:50.484 --> 00:25:53.387
(suspenseful music)

521
00:25:53.454 --> 00:25:55.056
(engine revving)

522
00:25:56.424 --> 00:25:59.160
(men chattering)

523
00:26:04.398 --> 00:26:07.468
(door opening)

524
00:26:07.536 --> 00:26:10.738
(suspenseful music)

525
00:26:14.809 --> 00:26:17.445
(keys jingling)

526
00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:20.714
(suspenseful music)

527
00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:25.686
(water trickling)

528
00:26:26.187 --> 00:26:28.557
Diamond, this isn't one of
your dad's fucking movies.

529
00:26:28.622 --> 00:26:30.424
This is real life.

530
00:26:30.491 --> 00:26:32.359
Get serious.
I am serious.

531
00:26:32.426 --> 00:26:35.396
If what I say isn't
exactly what happens,

532
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:36.697
then go ahead, call the cops.

533
00:26:36.764 --> 00:26:38.199
What are you talking about?

534
00:26:38.265 --> 00:26:40.668
We're going to get
a call any minute.

535
00:26:40.734 --> 00:26:42.903
Ezra, you're gonna
answer the phone.

536
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.306
Read exactly what I wrote.

537
00:26:45.372 --> 00:26:47.708
And then just, just hang up.

538
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.244
This is not a fucking film.

539
00:26:51.912 --> 00:26:54.782
(phone ringing)

540
00:26:55.716 --> 00:26:57.184
Answer it.

541
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:00.454
Answer it.

542
00:27:00.522 --> 00:27:03.858
(phone ringing)

543
00:27:03.924 --> 00:27:07.194
(phone ringing)

544
00:27:07.261 --> 00:27:08.762
(phone beeping)

545
00:27:10.464 --> 00:27:12.066
We have what you want.

546
00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:19.406
But, we also have a very
particular set of skills.

547
00:27:20.374 --> 00:27:24.111
Skills that we've acquired
over the years of our careers.

548
00:27:25.913 --> 00:27:29.316
Skills that make us a
nightmare for people like you.

549
00:27:30.585 --> 00:27:34.321
If you let our friend go now,
that'll be the end of it.

550
00:27:34.722 --> 00:27:36.390
We will not pursue you.

551
00:27:37.358 --> 00:27:38.926
But if you don't,

552
00:27:39.628 --> 00:27:41.295
we will look for you.

553
00:27:42.229 --> 00:27:43.731
We will find you.

554
00:27:44.465 --> 00:27:46.601
And we will kill you.

555
00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:49.136
(dramatic music)

556
00:27:49.203 --> 00:27:50.605
(phone beeping)

557
00:27:51.071 --> 00:27:54.208
That was fucking
awesome (laughs)!

558
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.744
You guys believe me now?

559
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.279
Diamond, what have we
gotten ourselves into?

560
00:27:58.345 --> 00:28:00.181
I know, but fuck this.

561
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:02.816
We're gonna go save Daisy.

562
00:28:03.484 --> 00:28:06.287
(soft upbeat music)

563
00:28:06.353 --> 00:28:07.488
Okay.

564
00:28:07.556 --> 00:28:08.756
(Ryder laughing)

565
00:28:08.923 --> 00:28:12.026
Okay, let's just break
down what happened.

566
00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:15.396
When the plane landed, somehow
Ryder's bag got mixed up

567
00:28:15.462 --> 00:28:17.398
with some kind of drug shipment.

568
00:28:17.464 --> 00:28:18.600
(marker squeaking)

569
00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:19.934
Whew.

570
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.570
Now, who could have done this?

571
00:28:21.636 --> 00:28:24.539
There were only two other
people than us on the plane.

572
00:28:24.606 --> 00:28:26.373
(marker squeaking)

573
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.142
But Jasper saved us.

574
00:28:28.209 --> 00:28:30.411
No, for all we know,
he was following us

575
00:28:30.477 --> 00:28:32.213
to find the missing bag.

576
00:28:32.279 --> 00:28:35.983
We can't trust him.
We can't trust anyone.

577
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.485
(mysterious music)

578
00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:42.256
Okay, they come in last night
looking for their product.

579
00:28:42.323 --> 00:28:45.326
They couldn't find it, so
they take collateral, Daisy.

580
00:28:45.392 --> 00:28:47.696
(marker squeaking)

581
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:49.564
This is seriously nuts.

582
00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:51.165
We have what they want.

583
00:28:51.232 --> 00:28:53.434
Well, they have what we want.

584
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.902
Who is they?

585
00:28:54.969 --> 00:28:56.904
It's a golden triangle.

586
00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:59.173
What is a golden triangle?

587
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.375
It's the area where
the borders of Laos,

588
00:29:01.442 --> 00:29:03.210
Myanmar and Thailand meet.

589
00:29:03.277 --> 00:29:05.513
One of the world's busiest
drug trafficking regions,

590
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.116
and, guys, we've just
fucked with the balance

591
00:29:09.183 --> 00:29:11.318
of the Thai's drug cartel.

592
00:29:11.385 --> 00:29:13.387
Oh shit! Oh fuck.

593
00:29:13.454 --> 00:29:14.689
Oh my God.

594
00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:15.956
(lighter clicking)

595
00:29:16.023 --> 00:29:18.125
So what's our next move?

596
00:29:18.192 --> 00:29:20.127
They will contact us
and deliver instructions

597
00:29:20.194 --> 00:29:22.162
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

598
00:29:22.229 --> 00:29:25.499
Likely somewhere in town
with lots of people around.

599
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.703
Diamond, this is all just
like a little bit too much,

600
00:29:28.769 --> 00:29:31.138
but I don't think that growing
up on your dad's movie sets

601
00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:34.275
makes you exactly qualified
or me exactly qualified

602
00:29:34.341 --> 00:29:37.746
to, you know, do a
hostage rescue situation.

603
00:29:37.811 --> 00:29:39.714
Yeah, I'm with her.

604
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.282
You have to believe me.

605
00:29:41.348 --> 00:29:44.018
I know we all love Daisy
and we need her back safe,

606
00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:45.520
but at this point,

607
00:29:47.589 --> 00:29:49.290
the only ones that
are going to be able

608
00:29:49.356 --> 00:29:52.192
to do this are the three of us.

609
00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:56.665
I do have one
question, though.

610
00:29:56.731 --> 00:29:57.931
Yeah, so do I.

611
00:29:58.098 --> 00:30:00.234
Where's the blow?
Where's the cocaine?

612
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.771
Follow me.

613
00:30:02.836 --> 00:30:05.939
(mysterious music)

614
00:30:11.812 --> 00:30:13.682
(device beeping)

615
00:30:13.748 --> 00:30:15.617
[Ryder] What is this?

616
00:30:15.684 --> 00:30:17.084
Panic room.

617
00:30:17.284 --> 00:30:19.521
Okay, so you tell us now
that you have a panic room?

618
00:30:20.254 --> 00:30:22.289
Because this is like
a totally normal thing

619
00:30:22.356 --> 00:30:24.592
that one has in
the house, right?

620
00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:27.361
(mysterious music)

621
00:30:27.428 --> 00:30:28.395
What up?

622
00:30:28.462 --> 00:30:30.097
This is fucking awesome.

623
00:30:30.164 --> 00:30:32.600
[Ezra] That's a lot of guns.

624
00:30:33.033 --> 00:30:34.335
What is that?

625
00:30:34.435 --> 00:30:37.505
Oh, that's a Replicator.
It's a 3-D printer.

626
00:30:37.572 --> 00:30:40.240
This is fucking badass!

627
00:30:40.709 --> 00:30:42.409
Okay, why does Daddy...

628
00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:46.113
What does your daddy
have one of these?

629
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.584
Uh, because he's rich and
famous and his life has value.

630
00:30:49.651 --> 00:30:51.885
He builds these panic
rooms for us everywhere.

631
00:30:51.952 --> 00:30:53.921
Like, gives him peace of mind.

632
00:30:54.922 --> 00:30:56.990
And here it is.

633
00:30:57.358 --> 00:30:59.326
No one knows about this room.

634
00:30:59.393 --> 00:31:01.895
There is no way of
finding it, tracking it.

635
00:31:01.962 --> 00:31:03.497
It's basically invisible.

636
00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:06.568
Diamond, what are we gonna do?

637
00:31:07.602 --> 00:31:10.505
We're going to town and act
as if nothing has happened.

638
00:31:10.572 --> 00:31:12.039
We don't alert anyone.

639
00:31:12.106 --> 00:31:13.641
They will find us and
deliver instructions

640
00:31:13.708 --> 00:31:15.075
for the drop and
trade for Daisy.

641
00:31:15.142 --> 00:31:17.277
Okay, and then what next?

642
00:31:17.344 --> 00:31:21.148
Then the shit, all gets real.

643
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:25.720
Who fucking has one of these?

644
00:31:25.787 --> 00:31:27.488
I bail.

645
00:31:28.757 --> 00:31:30.357
(beeping)

646
00:31:30.825 --> 00:31:34.361
(soft mysterious music)

647
00:31:38.232 --> 00:31:39.333
[Ezra] There's so many people.

648
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.636
Are you sure this
was a good idea?

649
00:31:41.703 --> 00:31:43.170
Three beers please.

650
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.874
Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are
we gonna do this on our own?

651
00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:47.675
By staying calm.

652
00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:49.209
I'm so stressed out.

653
00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:52.413
Look, if it was just one of us,
we would be in deep shit.

654
00:31:52.479 --> 00:31:55.817
If it was just two of us,
we would be totally fucked.

655
00:31:55.884 --> 00:31:57.552
But the three of us together,

656
00:31:57.619 --> 00:32:00.822
we make up one pretty
fucking lethal weapon.

657
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:02.289
How do you figure?

658
00:32:02.356 --> 00:32:06.927
We have the brains,
the body and the bimbo.

659
00:32:07.461 --> 00:32:08.996
Go on, yeah.

660
00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:11.666
I have lived every
one of my dad's films.

661
00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:15.135
I know these guys, what
they think, how they plan.

662
00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:17.471
I know their moves
before they do.

663
00:32:17.539 --> 00:32:19.239
I'm the brains.

664
00:32:19.973 --> 00:32:21.375
Ryder, you are the body.

665
00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:23.243
Your years of avoiding
anything in life that

666
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.146
is actually fun and
focusing all your energy

667
00:32:26.213 --> 00:32:27.649
on those extreme sporty things

668
00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:30.017
gives you a leg up
on these cocksuckers.

669
00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:33.353
When we need some
physical action, it's you.

670
00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.423
Oh, so that
makes me the bimbo.

671
00:32:38.158 --> 00:32:40.127
And what exactly do
you mean by that?

672
00:32:40.194 --> 00:32:41.995
It means, you're an actor.

673
00:32:42.062 --> 00:32:44.398
You're our voice.

674
00:32:44.465 --> 00:32:47.434
The words we say need to
come convincingly from you.

675
00:32:49.002 --> 00:32:52.973
Yeah, I can do that but I'm
really fucking stressed out.

676
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.441
I'm literally panicking.

677
00:32:55.543 --> 00:32:56.845
Chill.

678
00:32:56.911 --> 00:32:59.747
(engines revving)

679
00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:03.518
(boy speaking Thai)

680
00:33:03.585 --> 00:33:04.519
What did he say?

681
00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:06.153
Fuck do I know?

682
00:33:06.987 --> 00:33:09.757
(boy speaking Thai)

683
00:33:09.824 --> 00:33:13.528
The boy is saying the
daisies are in full bloom.

684
00:33:13.595 --> 00:33:15.162
No they're not.
They're like wilted.

685
00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:17.665
Buy the flowers.
Buy them now, buy them.

686
00:33:17.732 --> 00:33:18.999
Oh shit.

687
00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:20.400
Uh.

688
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.571
Thank you.
Thank you.

689
00:33:25.205 --> 00:33:28.610
(mysterious music)

690
00:33:28.676 --> 00:33:30.310
What do we do?

691
00:33:30.377 --> 00:33:31.445
Open it.

692
00:33:31.513 --> 00:33:32.547
Carefully.

693
00:33:32.614 --> 00:33:33.715
Me?

694
00:33:34.181 --> 00:33:35.449
I don't want to.

695
00:33:36.518 --> 00:33:37.317
Could be a bomb.

696
00:33:37.384 --> 00:33:39.521
Shut up.
Just do it.

697
00:33:40.053 --> 00:33:43.023
(people chattering)

698
00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.526
[Diamond] What is it?

699
00:33:44.592 --> 00:33:46.393
Oh, shit.

700
00:33:47.227 --> 00:33:48.663
Come over.

701
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.666
(mysterious music)

702
00:33:52.534 --> 00:33:55.537
Turn it on.
No, no. No.

703
00:33:56.303 --> 00:33:58.238
Turn it on carefully.

704
00:33:58.305 --> 00:34:01.408
(mysterious music)

705
00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:05.547
(device beeping)

706
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:15.255
This here is a banana spider.

707
00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:19.794
It is the most venomous
spider in the world.

708
00:34:20.294 --> 00:34:22.262
There is no antivenom.

709
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:24.799
So I suggest that
you don't move.

710
00:34:26.366 --> 00:34:29.604
(Daisy whimpering)

711
00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:31.706
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
(clicks tongue)

712
00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:35.677
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

713
00:34:35.743 --> 00:34:36.778
<i>There we go.</i>

714
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.417
(Daisy whimpering)

715
00:34:45.587 --> 00:34:48.255
Okay. Listen to me carefully.

716
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:52.492
<i>Go to the Fountain</i>
<i>Circle at Old Geptown.</i>

717
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.229
<i>There you will see</i>
<i>a big banyan tree.</i>

718
00:34:56.296 --> 00:34:59.499
<i>Be on the bench next</i>
<i>to it tomorrow at noon.</i>

719
00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:03.303
Bring the product, and
I'll bring your friend.

720
00:35:04.872 --> 00:35:06.306
(Spyder chuckles)

721
00:35:06.373 --> 00:35:08.810
(Daisy crying)

722
00:35:11.746 --> 00:35:13.881
Oh my God. Oh my God.

723
00:35:13.948 --> 00:35:15.550
This is so fucked up.

724
00:35:16.818 --> 00:35:20.253
If anything happens to Daisy,
if anything happens--

725
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.856
She will be fine.

726
00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:23.758
Okay.

727
00:35:23.825 --> 00:35:25.994
She is really strong.

728
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.863
Okay, we're just gonna
follow their instructions and...

729
00:35:29.697 --> 00:35:31.666
by this time tomorrow
Daisy will be back with us

730
00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:35.302
and we can get
the fuck out of here.

731
00:35:38.338 --> 00:35:39.607
She's right.

732
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.977
Let's just get back to the
villa and plan for tomorrow.

733
00:35:43.044 --> 00:35:44.411
Oh my God, Ezra.

734
00:35:44.478 --> 00:35:46.614
I am sorry.
You need to be clear of mind.

735
00:35:46.681 --> 00:35:47.882
Come on.

736
00:35:48.916 --> 00:35:51.853
(mysterious music)

737
00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:06.668
We need to get
ready for tomorrow.

738
00:36:06.734 --> 00:36:08.335
Always be prepared
for the worst.

739
00:36:08.402 --> 00:36:09.336
(waves crashing)

740
00:36:09.403 --> 00:36:10.705
Yeah, and what's that?

741
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:13.407
These guys don't
give a shit about us.

742
00:36:13.473 --> 00:36:15.510
As soon as they get
their stuff back,

743
00:36:15.576 --> 00:36:17.745
we no longer have
any value to them.

744
00:36:17.812 --> 00:36:19.847
We can't trust
anything they say.

745
00:36:19.914 --> 00:36:21.783
They will try to cheat us.

746
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:24.986
[Ezra] And then what?

747
00:36:25.053 --> 00:36:26.286
Plan B.

748
00:36:26.353 --> 00:36:28.288
What's Plan B?

749
00:36:28.355 --> 00:36:30.992
That is a very good
question I don't have

750
00:36:31.059 --> 00:36:32.627
the answer to right now.

751
00:36:32.694 --> 00:36:36.030
Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder,
you will do the drop.

752
00:36:36.097 --> 00:36:38.599
Ezra and I will find vantage
points where we can see

753
00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:40.635
everything that's going on.

754
00:36:40.702 --> 00:36:42.503
We'll be your eyes and ears.

755
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.772
Eyes and ears.

756
00:36:44.839 --> 00:36:47.141
(waves crashing)

757
00:36:47.207 --> 00:36:48.475
So what next?

758
00:36:49.409 --> 00:36:50.778
Target practice.

759
00:36:51.646 --> 00:36:53.948
Are you fucking kidding me?

760
00:36:54.015 --> 00:36:55.348
Okay, ladies, now,

761
00:36:55.415 --> 00:36:58.119
the most important thing
when you're firing a gun

762
00:36:58.186 --> 00:37:00.420
is your breath.

763
00:37:00.487 --> 00:37:02.355
Control your breathing
to keep yourself steady.

764
00:37:02.422 --> 00:37:04.257
(gun firing)

765
00:37:04.324 --> 00:37:07.662
Take aim through here and
slowly pull the trigger.

766
00:37:07.729 --> 00:37:09.329
(gun firing)

767
00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:11.666
(gun firing)
You need to be gentle.

768
00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:14.969
Slow. It's the foreplay
before the fuck.

769
00:37:15.036 --> 00:37:17.370
(gun firing)

770
00:37:17.437 --> 00:37:18.873
(glass smashing)

771
00:37:19.741 --> 00:37:21.374
Why doesn't that surprise me?

772
00:37:21.441 --> 00:37:23.711
Years of working on
that bullshit cop show,

773
00:37:23.778 --> 00:37:25.513
and still nothing
to show for it.

774
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.381
Okay, let me make
this easy for you.

775
00:37:28.448 --> 00:37:30.383
Hold the rifle steadily.

776
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:33.721
Put the butt firmly into
the pocket of your shoulder.

777
00:37:33.788 --> 00:37:35.089
Relax your body.

778
00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:38.126
Aim that little dot where
you want the bullet to go.

779
00:37:38.192 --> 00:37:39.527
And fire.

780
00:37:43.664 --> 00:37:44.632
Okay.

781
00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:47.568
Are you positive that we should
be handling these things?

782
00:37:47.635 --> 00:37:49.570
Like what, what makes
you such an expert

783
00:37:49.637 --> 00:37:52.740
on this, Diamond, like
playing with your dad's toys?

784
00:37:52.807 --> 00:37:54.374
Dad's toys?

785
00:37:55.342 --> 00:37:58.679
(gun firing and glass smashing)

786
00:37:59.747 --> 00:38:03.416
Yeah, I suppose so.
Get some sleep, ladies.

787
00:38:03.483 --> 00:38:06.486
(upbeat music)

788
00:38:07.922 --> 00:38:10.423
(music stops)

789
00:38:11.926 --> 00:38:14.562
[Ezra] Do you think it's
gonna be hot on the roof?

790
00:38:17.165 --> 00:38:18.398
It's showtime.

791
00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:20.268
Yeah, but can we please,
like, be careful?

792
00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:22.804
Yeah, sure.
Whatever, Mom.

793
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.337
What's in the bag?

794
00:38:25.506 --> 00:38:27.141
More toys.

795
00:38:27.208 --> 00:38:28.709
You ready?

796
00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:30.011
Let's go.

797
00:38:31.478 --> 00:38:33.614
She's fucking crazy.

798
00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:36.851
(suspenseful music)

799
00:38:44.391 --> 00:38:46.326
(bag unzipping)

800
00:38:49.297 --> 00:38:51.265
(bag unzipping)

801
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:54.035
(gun clicking)

802
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:57.104
(suspenseful music)

803
00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:02.442
Come to Thailand,
it'll be sick.

804
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:04.145
It'll be a blast.

805
00:39:04.212 --> 00:39:06.379
Oh Ryder, you're
doing just fine.

806
00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:08.015
<i>Just take a seat on the bench.</i>

807
00:39:15.156 --> 00:39:17.390
<i>You look great, by the way.</i>

808
00:39:18.292 --> 00:39:21.494
(suspenseful music)

809
00:39:26.133 --> 00:39:28.069
(phone ringing)

810
00:39:28.803 --> 00:39:30.905
Shit, there's a phone here.

811
00:39:31.873 --> 00:39:33.040
What do I do?

812
00:39:33.107 --> 00:39:34.141
Answer it.

813
00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:36.310
<i>Don't speak, just listen.</i>

814
00:39:36.376 --> 00:39:38.679
(phone ringing)

815
00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:41.082
(phone beeping)

816
00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:42.683
<i>There's a black van that's</i>

817
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:45.152
pulling into the
square right now.

818
00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:46.386
<i>Look to your left.</i>

819
00:39:46.453 --> 00:39:49.657
(suspenseful music)

820
00:39:52.093 --> 00:39:55.696
<i>Also, there's a trash</i>
<i>bin beyond the tree.</i>

821
00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:58.799
<i>Drop the duffel</i>
<i>bag into the bin,</i>

822
00:39:59.233 --> 00:40:00.735
and we'll let your friend go.

823
00:40:02.536 --> 00:40:05.072
(suspenseful music)

824
00:40:05.139 --> 00:40:06.374
Something does not feel right.

825
00:40:06.574 --> 00:40:08.342
Ryder, just put the
drugs in the trash bin

826
00:40:08.408 --> 00:40:09.476
<i>and let's get Daisy home.</i>

827
00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:10.645
(phone beeping)

828
00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:13.648
(suspenseful music)

829
00:40:25.626 --> 00:40:27.161
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

830
00:40:30.264 --> 00:40:33.000
(heart pounding)

831
00:40:35.435 --> 00:40:36.837
(gun firing)

832
00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:38.539
It's not her!

833
00:40:38.606 --> 00:40:40.107
Shit, run!

834
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:44.145
(guns firing)

835
00:40:45.079 --> 00:40:46.113
Okay, let's go.

836
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:51.484
(engines revving)

837
00:40:51.552 --> 00:40:54.588
(suspenseful music)

838
00:40:57.358 --> 00:40:59.060
(tires squealing)

839
00:40:59.327 --> 00:41:01.329
(Ryder grunting)

840
00:41:01.562 --> 00:41:03.831
(guns firing)

841
00:41:04.565 --> 00:41:06.801
(engines revving)

842
00:41:07.435 --> 00:41:09.670
(gun firing)

843
00:41:09.737 --> 00:41:12.573
(engines revving)

844
00:41:15.376 --> 00:41:18.245
(Ryder panting)

845
00:41:19.981 --> 00:41:21.582
Stop, stop, stop!

846
00:41:29.357 --> 00:41:31.525
(engines revving)

847
00:41:32.259 --> 00:41:35.262
(suspenseful music)

848
00:41:48.709 --> 00:41:50.945
(engine revving)

849
00:41:51.012 --> 00:41:53.147
(Ryder crashing)

850
00:41:53.214 --> 00:41:56.117
(man shouting in Thai)

851
00:41:56.183 --> 00:41:58.919
(dramatic music)

852
00:41:59.587 --> 00:42:02.790
(Ryder groaning)

853
00:42:04.558 --> 00:42:07.695
(dramatic music)

854
00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:14.001
(brakes squealing)

855
00:42:19.273 --> 00:42:21.409
Ah! Fuckers!

856
00:42:21.475 --> 00:42:22.843
We are in way over our heads,

857
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.079
and we need to
call the cops now!

858
00:42:25.146 --> 00:42:26.447
No cops, Ezra.

859
00:42:26.515 --> 00:42:27.782
Diamond's right.

860
00:42:27.982 --> 00:42:29.784
These assholes fucked
with the wrong girls.

861
00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.318
Payback's gonna be a bitch.

862
00:42:31.419 --> 00:42:34.088
Okay, tough guy, one problem.
We have no leverage.

863
00:42:34.155 --> 00:42:37.158
They have Daisy and now
they also have the cocaine.

864
00:42:37.224 --> 00:42:38.893
Fuck, she's right.

865
00:42:39.427 --> 00:42:42.296
(birds singing)

866
00:42:42.363 --> 00:42:43.664
We're fucking screwed.

867
00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:47.568
Holy shit.

868
00:42:47.635 --> 00:42:49.236
Holy shit.

869
00:42:49.336 --> 00:42:52.640
Yeah, they were never going
to just hand Daisy back to us.

870
00:42:52.706 --> 00:42:54.642
This was always the first
step in getting her back.

871
00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:56.844
That's how I knew it
wasn't Daisy today.

872
00:42:56.911 --> 00:42:59.814
Bold move D-dog,
you gonna tell us or?

873
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.816
I needed you guys
to be convincing.

874
00:43:01.882 --> 00:43:03.084
Okay, I just, I need a break.

875
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.086
I am so stressed out right now.

876
00:43:05.152 --> 00:43:06.020
(TV beeping on)

877
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.823
Wait, if the coke
was here, then--

878
00:43:08.889 --> 00:43:10.424
What was in the
bag I gave them?

879
00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:13.360
Oh, it was just filled with
Ezra's panties, bras and all.

880
00:43:13.427 --> 00:43:14.762
(Ryder laughing)

881
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:16.397
Okay, so are we even now?

882
00:43:16.464 --> 00:43:18.766
Not even.
But we're getting there.

883
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.269
All right, what's next?
Plan B.

884
00:43:22.336 --> 00:43:24.605
(newscaster speaking Thai)

885
00:43:24.672 --> 00:43:26.173
What are you thinking?

886
00:43:26.474 --> 00:43:29.643
<i>Of the Thai drug cartel, an</i>
<i>avid supporter of Muay Thai</i>

887
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.980
<i>Koon has been rumored to be</i>
<i>training his prizefighter</i>

888
00:43:33.047 --> 00:43:37.084
<i>known as Goliath in a</i>
<i>completely unconventional way.</i>

889
00:43:37.151 --> 00:43:39.820
Pause it. Pause it,
pause it, pause it.

890
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:42.990
What are you thinking?

891
00:43:44.425 --> 00:43:45.926
Tomorrow at the fight club,

892
00:43:45.993 --> 00:43:48.563
we're gonna kidnap the head
of Thai's drug cartel.

893
00:43:48.629 --> 00:43:49.763
and trade him for Daisy.

894
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.032
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

895
00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:54.335
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your mind.

896
00:43:54.401 --> 00:43:56.003
No, I'm down.

897
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.905
I'll do whatever it
takes to get Daisy back.

898
00:43:57.972 --> 00:44:00.609
Good to know.
We've gotta start stretching.

899
00:44:00.674 --> 00:44:02.443
Fine, what's the plan?

900
00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:05.514
Ezra, are you still
shooting up that teen tox?

901
00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.714
(Ezra laughing)

902
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:08.082
What?

903
00:44:10.384 --> 00:44:11.318
Now and then.

904
00:44:11.385 --> 00:44:12.753
Oh.

905
00:44:14.054 --> 00:44:15.557
Go grab your syringes.

906
00:44:15.823 --> 00:44:19.193
Then go to Daisy's room and
take all of her sleeping pills.

907
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.163
Ryder, you know how to
work that 3-D printer?

908
00:44:22.229 --> 00:44:23.497
Fuck yeah.

909
00:44:23.664 --> 00:44:27.268
Okay, it's time to kiss my
Balmain latex one-piece goodbye.

910
00:44:27.334 --> 00:44:28.702
[Ezra] Why?

911
00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:30.204
Trust me.

912
00:44:30.404 --> 00:44:31.705
Okay, let's go.

913
00:44:31.772 --> 00:44:32.973
Okay.

914
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.411
(upbeat electronic music)

915
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.988
(gun clicking)

916
00:44:48.923 --> 00:44:51.992
(pestle clacking)

917
00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:53.827
(upbeat electronic music)

918
00:44:53.894 --> 00:44:55.696
(can spraying)

919
00:44:55.763 --> 00:44:59.033
(upbeat electronic music)

920
00:45:01.702 --> 00:45:02.937
(TV beeping on)

921
00:45:03.237 --> 00:45:07.408
<i>In our path, he will</i>
<i>be the next undis--</i>

922
00:45:07.474 --> 00:45:08.809
(TV beeping off)

923
00:45:11.045 --> 00:45:14.181
(upbeat electronic music)

924
00:45:30.397 --> 00:45:32.166
(music stops)

925
00:45:35.035 --> 00:45:37.104
(water lapping)

926
00:45:37.171 --> 00:45:38.540
I really hope
you don't expect us

927
00:45:38.607 --> 00:45:39.641
to go out with you tonight.

928
00:45:39.708 --> 00:45:41.809
No. I don't want us to go out.

929
00:45:41.875 --> 00:45:43.310
Great, great.

930
00:45:43.377 --> 00:45:44.512
I'm going out.

931
00:45:44.579 --> 00:45:45.746
What?

932
00:45:45.813 --> 00:45:47.014
I'm seeing Jasper.

933
00:45:47.081 --> 00:45:48.482
Oh.
You really think tonight

934
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:49.883
is the time for you

935
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:52.152
to dip your butt
back to the dating pool?

936
00:45:52.219 --> 00:45:55.956
Well, you know, there's
something off about him.

937
00:45:56.023 --> 00:45:58.392
Something he's not telling us.

938
00:45:58.459 --> 00:46:02.196
And you're gonna use your
vagina to get it outta him?

939
00:46:04.633 --> 00:46:06.133
No, babe.

940
00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:08.802
But for all we know, he's got
something to do with this.

941
00:46:08.869 --> 00:46:11.038
So, you know what they say,

942
00:46:11.105 --> 00:46:13.742
keep your friends close but
keep your enemies closer.

943
00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:18.245
Yeah, you know what they
also say? Don't fuck the enemy.

944
00:46:19.446 --> 00:46:20.814
Focus on tomorrow.

945
00:46:21.015 --> 00:46:24.485
Make sure you understand
exactly what needs to be done.

946
00:46:24.552 --> 00:46:27.321
We mess up, we're all dead.

947
00:46:27.388 --> 00:46:28.623
Don't wait up.

948
00:46:28.757 --> 00:46:30.558
(water lapping)

949
00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:35.462
(soft suspenseful music)

950
00:46:39.066 --> 00:46:42.236
(patrons chattering)

951
00:46:48.275 --> 00:46:51.378
[Jasper] Wow.
You clean up nice.

952
00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:53.981
And you barely
cleaned up at all.

953
00:46:54.048 --> 00:46:56.450
Vodka martini,
shaken, not stirred.

954
00:46:56.518 --> 00:46:58.919
(soft music)

955
00:47:00.655 --> 00:47:03.558
So, are you surprised I called?

956
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:05.527
No.

957
00:47:06.327 --> 00:47:07.294
I'm not.

958
00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:08.797
I'm more surprised you called

959
00:47:08.896 --> 00:47:11.031
and you're not in
some kind of trouble.

960
00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:12.499
Funny.

961
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:16.036
How's the trip going so far?

962
00:47:17.338 --> 00:47:20.074
Mm, could be better.
Could be worse.

963
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:22.209
Right.

964
00:47:24.378 --> 00:47:25.979
What about Daisy?

965
00:47:27.114 --> 00:47:30.217
Daisy seemed a little
shaken up the other night.

966
00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.188
Daisy, you know, she's Daisy.

967
00:47:34.254 --> 00:47:36.924
Always seems to
get in trouble, but

968
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.293
always finds her way out.

969
00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:41.261
Cheers.

970
00:47:41.796 --> 00:47:43.163
Right.

971
00:47:45.165 --> 00:47:47.535
What's your deal, Diamond?

972
00:47:48.135 --> 00:47:51.205
I feel like there's a lot
going on inside of you that

973
00:47:51.271 --> 00:47:53.440
you don't allow people to see.

974
00:47:54.108 --> 00:47:55.810
There's always more.

975
00:47:55.876 --> 00:47:57.545
Okay, go on.

976
00:47:59.446 --> 00:48:03.818
Look, everyone thinks
growing up in Hollywood,

977
00:48:03.884 --> 00:48:05.386
jumping around the world,

978
00:48:05.452 --> 00:48:09.223
they think this life
is a dream come true.

979
00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:11.526
And in so many ways it is.

980
00:48:12.827 --> 00:48:16.430
But, my mom left
when I was a kid.

981
00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:20.735
One night she just
packed up and was gone.

982
00:48:20.802 --> 00:48:22.469
No goodbyes, nothing.

983
00:48:24.204 --> 00:48:28.275
My dad took it really hard.
He struggled for years.

984
00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:31.278
He put all his
energy into his work,

985
00:48:31.345 --> 00:48:34.415
and nothing else mattered.

986
00:48:35.517 --> 00:48:37.117
Not even me.

987
00:48:38.653 --> 00:48:41.589
I guess work became his drug and

988
00:48:41.656 --> 00:48:45.325
then it was success,
and now it's the girls.

989
00:48:45.392 --> 00:48:47.595
Trying to make him
feel young again.

990
00:48:49.029 --> 00:48:52.499
And, in the midst of all this,

991
00:48:53.434 --> 00:48:55.202
I had to grow up on my own.

992
00:48:56.905 --> 00:49:01.408
Figure out who I really am
and what I really want and

993
00:49:02.677 --> 00:49:04.111
I think I'm still trying.

994
00:49:06.113 --> 00:49:08.482
I think you're doing
a pretty good job.

995
00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:12.986
(patrons chattering)

996
00:49:13.053 --> 00:49:14.455
You wanna take a walk?

997
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:18.158
Mm-hm.

998
00:49:19.259 --> 00:49:21.962
So, what's your deal, Jasper?

999
00:49:22.029 --> 00:49:23.130
Me?

1000
00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.265
Yeah, the man
with many questions

1001
00:49:25.332 --> 00:49:27.301
and never a single answer.

1002
00:49:27.702 --> 00:49:29.102
Um.

1003
00:49:30.605 --> 00:49:31.840
(stone splashing)

1004
00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:34.975
There's not really much
glitz and glamor in my life.

1005
00:49:35.042 --> 00:49:36.711
I mean...

1006
00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:39.747
my parents split
up when I was young

1007
00:49:39.814 --> 00:49:44.418
and, careful, my dad
was a New York cop.

1008
00:49:44.485 --> 00:49:45.920
Mm?

1009
00:49:45.986 --> 00:49:49.356
My mom took
a cushy job in LA and

1010
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:52.927
kinda, just like you,
was fending for my own.

1011
00:49:52.993 --> 00:49:54.061
Right?

1012
00:49:54.261 --> 00:49:56.363
We had enough to
make ends meet, but

1013
00:49:57.297 --> 00:50:00.167
pretty much raised
myself, you know.

1014
00:50:00.234 --> 00:50:04.304
Don't know if I did a good job,

1015
00:50:05.005 --> 00:50:07.675
but yeah, flying is

1016
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.546
the only thing that
made me feel free.

1017
00:50:12.714 --> 00:50:16.751
Flying up there, high
above my troubles.

1018
00:50:17.652 --> 00:50:19.319
(waves lapping)

1019
00:50:19.386 --> 00:50:20.454
I guess we have more in common

1020
00:50:20.522 --> 00:50:22.055
with each other than we thought.

1021
00:50:22.122 --> 00:50:23.423
Yeah.

Fucker.

1039

(Ezra whistling)

1043
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.964
Wow, well that
was a long drink.

1044
00:52:43.031 --> 00:52:44.431
Fuck you.

1045
00:52:44.632 --> 00:52:47.467
I see what you mean about
keeping the enemies close.

1046
00:52:47.535 --> 00:52:51.238
Did you find
anything out at least?

1047
00:52:51.304 --> 00:52:55.043
Yeah, I found out
we can't trust Jasper.

1048
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:56.711
Oh, shit.

1049
00:52:57.145 --> 00:52:59.379
(exhales) You have
all the supplies?

1050
00:52:59.446 --> 00:53:01.149
Yeah.
[Diamond] You got everything?

1051
00:53:01.214 --> 00:53:02.482
Mm-hm.
Everything.

1052
00:53:02.617 --> 00:53:04.284
You understand exactly
what we're doing?

1053
00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:06.754
Diamond, we're fine.

1054
00:53:08.556 --> 00:53:10.892
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

1055
00:53:11.626 --> 00:53:14.261
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

1056
00:53:14.327 --> 00:53:16.964
Follow the plan,
we get Daisy back.

1057
00:53:19.967 --> 00:53:21.035
(fist thudding)

1058
00:53:21.102 --> 00:53:22.870
(kick striking)

1059
00:53:22.937 --> 00:53:24.939
(Goliath screaming)

1060
00:53:25.006 --> 00:53:27.742
(crowd cheering)

1061
00:53:33.581 --> 00:53:36.316
Another victim
falls to our Goliath.

1062
00:53:36.383 --> 00:53:39.319
There is no obstacle
in our path.

1063
00:53:39.386 --> 00:53:43.256
He will be the next
undisputed champion.

1064
00:53:43.524 --> 00:53:45.660
He is unstoppable.

1065
00:53:45.727 --> 00:53:49.329
Another day, and he's
destroyed everyone in sight.

1066
00:53:49.396 --> 00:53:52.499
(crowd cheering)

1067
00:53:52.567 --> 00:53:54.468
Got time for one more?

1068
00:53:56.804 --> 00:53:57.939
A woman?

1069
00:53:58.906 --> 00:54:01.274
Here's our buy-in.
Ryder, go get ready.

1070
00:54:01.341 --> 00:54:02.944
(Ryder spitting)

1071
00:54:03.711 --> 00:54:06.581
You just bought a ticket
for your friend's funeral.

1072
00:54:08.348 --> 00:54:09.584
Do you have a name?

1073
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:10.852
Diamond.

1074
00:54:11.119 --> 00:54:12.053
Just Diamond?

1075
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.386
Just Diamond.

1076
00:54:13.521 --> 00:54:15.489
And what brings you to
my country, Just Diamond?

1077
00:54:15.556 --> 00:54:17.191
I'm here on vacation.

1078
00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:19.127
And how has that been so far?

1079
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.428
Pretty uneventful.

1080
00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:24.297
We'll certainly have
to change that, won't we?

1081
00:54:24.364 --> 00:54:26.667
(lighter clicking)

1082
00:54:28.903 --> 00:54:30.104
I'm counting on that.

1083
00:54:30.171 --> 00:54:32.840
(crowd jeering)

1084
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.516
(dramatic music)

1085
00:54:43.684 --> 00:54:46.053
I'll be gracious and
keep all your money.

1086
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.354
Tell your friend to go home.

1087
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:48.923
She has nothing to prove.

1088
00:54:49.056 --> 00:54:51.259
Perhaps we can get to know
each other a little better.

1089
00:54:51.324 --> 00:54:55.229
How about I make
you that same offer?

1090
00:54:55.295 --> 00:54:57.899
(upbeat music)

1091
00:55:03.237 --> 00:55:05.907
(crowd cheering)

1092
00:55:05.973 --> 00:55:08.576
(upbeat music)

1093
00:55:17.985 --> 00:55:20.588
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

1094
00:55:21.289 --> 00:55:22.256
You found it.

1095
00:55:22.322 --> 00:55:23.891
(glasses clinking)

1096
00:55:23.958 --> 00:55:26.694
(upbeat music)

1097
00:55:27.228 --> 00:55:30.363
(kicks striking)

1098
00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:34.235
(punches striking)

1099
00:55:34.302 --> 00:55:37.138
(crowd cheering)

1100
00:55:37.205 --> 00:55:38.873
(kick striking)

1101
00:55:41.008 --> 00:55:42.877
(body thudding)

1102
00:55:42.944 --> 00:55:45.780
(crowd cheering)

1103
00:55:51.484 --> 00:55:53.988
(blows striking)

1104
00:55:54.055 --> 00:55:56.724
(both grunting)

1105
00:55:57.525 --> 00:56:00.161
(body thudding)

1106
00:56:00.228 --> 00:56:02.495
(Goliath screaming)

1107
00:56:03.463 --> 00:56:05.365
The end is near for your friend.

1108
00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:07.768
Shall we double the wager?

1109
00:56:07.835 --> 00:56:11.906
Diamond, you shine
bright, but clearly flawed.

1110
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:16.510
(crowd cheering)

1111
00:56:18.145 --> 00:56:19.814
(Ryder spitting)

1112
00:56:21.582 --> 00:56:24.518
(kicks striking)

1113
00:56:27.288 --> 00:56:29.523
(punches striking)

1114
00:56:34.427 --> 00:56:36.030
(blows striking)

1115
00:56:36.931 --> 00:56:39.600
(both groaning)

1116
00:56:41.569 --> 00:56:43.104
(bones crackling)

1117
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.639
(body thudding)

1118
00:56:50.443 --> 00:56:53.614
(soft dramatic music)

1119
00:56:56.183 --> 00:56:57.251
(kick striking)

1120
00:56:57.318 --> 00:56:59.987
(crowd jeering)

1121
00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:09.063
I've never lost in anything.

1122
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:13.534
(soft music)

1123
00:57:15.036 --> 00:57:16.170
Let's fuck.

1124
00:57:16.237 --> 00:57:18.739
(soft music)

1125
00:57:25.079 --> 00:57:27.648
(crowd booing)

1126
00:57:35.156 --> 00:57:36.824
What kind of girl
do you think I am?

1127
00:57:36.891 --> 00:57:39.226
Ryder, grab your shit
and let's get out of here.

1128
00:57:40.528 --> 00:57:43.664
(dramatic music)

1129
00:58:00.114 --> 00:58:02.550
Did you really think you
would leave without me?

1130
00:58:02.616 --> 00:58:04.051
[Diamond] Get in.

1131
00:58:08.189 --> 00:58:09.690
I thought you'd never ask.

1132
00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:12.492
(upbeat music)

1133
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:14.261
[Diamond] Let's go.

1134
00:58:18.632 --> 00:58:20.134
Holy fuck, we did it.

1135
00:58:20.568 --> 00:58:22.036
My heart's about to explode.

1136
00:58:22.103 --> 00:58:24.338
Guys, this is still
so far from over.

1137
00:58:24.405 --> 00:58:26.874
How many sleeping pills did
you shoot him up with?

1138
00:58:26.941 --> 00:58:28.776
Enough.

1139
00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:34.548
(upbeat music)

1140
00:58:39.854 --> 00:58:43.657
<i>♪ Please won't you like me ♪</i>

1141
00:58:44.392 --> 00:58:46.927

(upbeat music)

1149
00:59:16.957 --> 00:59:19.427
Who the fuck are you, girls?

1150
00:59:19.493 --> 00:59:21.395
Do you know who I am?

1151
00:59:21.462 --> 00:59:22.763
(chains rattling)

1152
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.399
You just signed your death wish!

1153
00:59:25.466 --> 00:59:27.568
Come on, we just want to talk.

1154
00:59:27.635 --> 00:59:29.303
(Koon spitting)
Shit.

1155
00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:32.440
Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

1156
00:59:32.507 --> 00:59:35.609
Don't waste your energy.
You're tied up pretty good.

1157
00:59:37.044 --> 00:59:37.878
Where am I?

1158
00:59:37.945 --> 00:59:39.413
Where you are doesn't matter.

1159
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:42.216
Where our friend Daisy is does.

1160
00:59:42.283 --> 00:59:43.651
What is Daisy?

1161
00:59:43.717 --> 00:59:46.454
Daisy is our friend that
your cartel kidnapped.

1162
00:59:46.521 --> 00:59:47.822
And I know nothing of this.

1163
00:59:47.888 --> 00:59:49.223
You see, that I believe.

1164
00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:51.192
But all we wanted was
to come to Phuket,

1165
00:59:51.258 --> 00:59:53.627
have a little vacay,
maybe dance a bit,

1166
00:59:53.694 --> 00:59:55.262
drink a bit, fuck a bit.

1167
00:59:55.329 --> 00:59:57.665
But that just isn't
happening now.

1168
00:59:57.731 --> 00:59:58.899
She's right.

1169
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.868
We get back to our
villa on our first night

1170
01:00:00.935 --> 01:00:02.537
and my shit-for-crap duffel bag

1171
01:00:02.603 --> 01:00:04.105
is full of bricks of cocaine.

1172
01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:07.441
Somehow your product got
mixed up with our luggage.

1173
01:00:07.509 --> 01:00:08.577
And we wake up the next morning

1174
01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:10.778
and our friend Daisy is gone.

1175
01:00:12.713 --> 01:00:15.382
(alarm blaring)

1176
01:00:22.756 --> 01:00:26.393
(soft suspenseful music)

1177
01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:30.097
Silly bitches,
did you not think

1178
01:00:30.164 --> 01:00:32.066
that they would
come looking for me?

1179
01:00:32.133 --> 01:00:35.836
Oh sweetheart,
of course we did.

1180
01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:38.172
(women screaming)

1181
01:00:38.239 --> 01:00:39.206
(screaming stops)

1182
01:00:39.273 --> 01:00:40.609
(women screaming)

1183
01:00:40.674 --> 01:00:41.610
(screaming stops)

1184
01:00:41.675 --> 01:00:42.611
(women screaming)

1185
01:00:42.676 --> 01:00:44.278
We're over here!

1186
01:00:44.345 --> 01:00:45.312
Come up here!

1187
01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:46.647
Come and get us!

1188
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:48.115
We've kidnapped the head
of the Thai drug cartel,

1189
01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:50.084
and he's being held
hostage by three...

1190
01:00:50.151 --> 01:00:52.987
[Women] Silly, silly bitches!

1191
01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:56.957
Oh, you're basically dab
smack in the middle of nowhere.

1192
01:00:57.024 --> 01:01:01.395
No one can hear you, and no
one is ever going to find you.

1193
01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:05.766
See, we needed
something more valuable

1194
01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:08.068
than coke to get her back.

1195
01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:10.471
We needed you.

1196
01:01:10.539 --> 01:01:13.874
(soft mysterious music)

1197
01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:19.847
(music stops)

1198
01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.217
Oh, your boyfriend's here.

1199
01:01:25.587 --> 01:01:27.021
You have a boyfriend?

1200
01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:28.789
Sorry, man.

1201
01:01:32.561 --> 01:01:34.361
I'm gonna go see what he wants.

1202
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:39.967
Jasper?

1203
01:01:41.302 --> 01:01:42.836
What are you doing here?

1204
01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:47.074
(soft suspenseful music)

1205
01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:48.776
Well you left rather
quickly in the morning,

1206
01:01:48.842 --> 01:01:50.377
so I thought I'd
just check up on you.

1207
01:01:50.444 --> 01:01:51.946
I'm fine. I'm a big girl.

1208
01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:54.114
I don't need anyone
checking in on me.

1209
01:01:55.115 --> 01:01:56.685
Diamond, there's something
you should know, okay?

1210
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.587
Don't move an inch more.

1211
01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:02.022
I will light you up, Jasper,
or whoever the fuck you are.

1212
01:02:02.089 --> 01:02:03.490
Diamond, put the
gun down, okay?

1213
01:02:03.558 --> 01:02:07.194
Come on. I know you're
involved in all this.

1214
01:02:07.261 --> 01:02:08.862
I found Ryder's
bag in your room.

1215
01:02:08.929 --> 01:02:12.032
All right, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

1216
01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:13.602
I've been watching you girls,

1217
01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:15.736
but I know all about
the drugs, okay.

1218
01:02:15.803 --> 01:02:17.471
Raise your hands.

1219
01:02:17.539 --> 01:02:19.273
I'm with the fucking DEA.

1220
01:02:21.643 --> 01:02:24.044
The badge is in my back pocket.

1221
01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:26.313
Show me.

1222
01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.682
Slowly.

1223
01:02:27.748 --> 01:02:31.385
(soft suspenseful music)

1224
01:02:32.654 --> 01:02:34.955
(badge clattering)

1225
01:02:35.557 --> 01:02:38.425
(birds singing)

1226
01:02:42.763 --> 01:02:43.864
What the fuck?

1227
01:02:43.931 --> 01:02:47.535
(soft suspenseful music)

1228
01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:52.306
They're using your
father's jet as a mule.

1229
01:02:52.373 --> 01:02:53.807
They've been chartering
cocaine in and out

1230
01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:55.943
of the golden
triangle for years.

1231
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.111
We've got the pilot in custody.

1232
01:02:57.177 --> 01:02:59.280
He's been working
with the cartel.

1233
01:03:00.014 --> 01:03:01.549
Is my dad involved in this?

1234
01:03:01.616 --> 01:03:05.386
No, he's not. He doesn't
know anything about it.

1235
01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:07.087
What happened?

1236
01:03:07.756 --> 01:03:09.557
We hit some bad air.

1237
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:12.326
Got there a little
bit ahead of schedule.

1238
01:03:12.393 --> 01:03:14.094
The plan was to make
another run to the US.

1239
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:15.462
Look, I don't know.

1240
01:03:15.697 --> 01:03:17.532
Honestly, I don't know
how the bags got mixed up.

1241
01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:20.134
But you knew about Daisy
and her being kidnapped.

1242
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.502
I do.

1243
01:03:25.906 --> 01:03:28.442
I assumed they would come back
to the villa for the bags.

1244
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:30.978
I didn't think they were
gonna snatch up Daisy.

1245
01:03:31.713 --> 01:03:33.648
These are bad fucking dudes.

1246
01:03:33.715 --> 01:03:36.917
I'm in too deep with them.
I can't blow my cover.

1247
01:03:36.984 --> 01:03:39.119
I do have a contact at the DEA.

1248
01:03:39.853 --> 01:03:41.589
He's gonna call the embassy.

1249
01:03:41.656 --> 01:03:44.526
Hopefully set up a
rescue team for Daisy.

1250
01:03:44.592 --> 01:03:46.327
No, no fucking way.

1251
01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.861
What?

1252
01:03:47.928 --> 01:03:49.430
We've got this covered.

1253
01:03:49.496 --> 01:03:51.533
What do you got covered?

1254
01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.535
This is the Thai drug cartel.

1255
01:03:53.601 --> 01:03:57.071
Well now that you've
been honest with me,

1256
01:03:57.137 --> 01:03:59.239
I should probably
come clean with you.

1257
01:04:01.676 --> 01:04:03.043
(TV beeping on)

1258
01:04:08.583 --> 01:04:10.351
What the fuck is this?

1259
01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:13.287
That's the head of Thai cartel.

1260
01:04:13.354 --> 01:04:14.488
Calm down.

1261
01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:16.558
Calm down.

1262
01:04:17.391 --> 01:04:20.160
D, this isn't a fucking movie.
You're not Wonder Woman.

1263
01:04:20.227 --> 01:04:22.296
Fuck you. Because I'm
a girl, I'm Wonder Woman?

1264
01:04:22.363 --> 01:04:24.465
No, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

1265
01:04:27.368 --> 01:04:29.403
You actually care, don't you?

1266
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.971
Of course I care.

1267
01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:34.074
Let's do it like this.
Just give me 24 hours.

1268
01:04:34.576 --> 01:04:36.711
If we can't get Daisy
back on our own,

1269
01:04:36.778 --> 01:04:38.145
do what you need to do.

1270
01:04:38.278 --> 01:04:40.247
But, you know, best-case
scenario, we rescue Daisy,

1271
01:04:40.314 --> 01:04:42.249
you get to keep your
cover and we all go back

1272
01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:46.019
to our lives before
all this mess.

1273
01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:48.155
(Jasper exhaling)

1274
01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:50.525
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this.

1275
01:04:51.726 --> 01:04:54.027
You've got 24 hours, okay?

1276
01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:56.463
Oh wait.

1277
01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:59.634
There's one thing I'm
gonna need from you.

1278
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.068
Yeah, what's that?

1279
01:05:01.268 --> 01:05:04.204
Meet me here tomorrow
morning. I'll explain then.

1280
01:05:07.007 --> 01:05:08.308
So cute.

1281
01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:10.612
Anyway.

1282
01:05:10.678 --> 01:05:14.014
(mysterious music)

1283
01:05:21.021 --> 01:05:24.224
(soft upbeat music)

1284
01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.228
(shears snipping)

1285
01:05:29.898 --> 01:05:31.465
Are you trying to scare me?

1286
01:05:32.065 --> 01:05:33.635
Are you kidding me?

1287
01:05:34.067 --> 01:05:36.671
Do you not think I've
been tortured before?

1288
01:05:36.738 --> 01:05:39.139
Oh, ye of little faith.
(shears snipping)

1289
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.509
Muzzle this fucker.

1290
01:05:43.545 --> 01:05:44.612
(Koon groaning)

1291
01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:47.014
Oh Ryder, what the fuck?

1292
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.783
You're not the
only one with toys.

1293
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:49.851
(muffled speaking)

1294
01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:51.018
And it's pink.

1295
01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:52.386
Okay.

1296
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.389
(Koon groaning)

1297
01:05:56.558 --> 01:05:59.460
(computer beeping)

1298
01:06:01.428 --> 01:06:03.197
<i>You think there's a game?</i>

1299
01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:05.299
<i>You must not value</i>
<i>your friend's life.</i>

1300
01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:08.335
Well, I guess we don't.
So fucking kill her.

1301
01:06:08.402 --> 01:06:10.204
<i>Don't push me, little girls.</i>

1302
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.873
<i>How do you know she's</i>
<i>not already dead?</i>

1303
01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.274
Oh, because I
have what you want,

1304
01:06:14.341 --> 01:06:15.710
and the only way you're
gonna get it back

1305
01:06:15.777 --> 01:06:17.411
is by giving me what I want.

1306
01:06:17.478 --> 01:06:20.447
<i>And you think you have</i>
<i>leverage? You don't.</i>

1307
01:06:20.515 --> 01:06:22.817
<i>I don't give a fuck</i>
<i>about the coke!</i>

1308
01:06:22.884 --> 01:06:26.119
But, Spyder, it's not the
coke that is our leverage.

1309
01:06:26.186 --> 01:06:28.088
It's the delivery boy.

1310
01:06:28.556 --> 01:06:31.425
(Koon groaning)

1311
01:06:32.226 --> 01:06:33.962
<i>Jesus Fucking Christ.</i>

1312
01:06:34.027 --> 01:06:36.497
Meet me tomorrow at the
Big Buddha Temple, same time.

1313
01:06:36.564 --> 01:06:39.634
You wanna see him alive,
you do exactly as I say.

1314
01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:42.469
(computer beeping)

1315
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:45.172
Unmuzzle him.

1316
01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:47.675
(soft music)

1317
01:06:49.343 --> 01:06:52.112
Do you think you're gonna
leave that place alive?

1318
01:06:52.179 --> 01:06:53.480
Oh, who's the fool now?

1319
01:06:53.548 --> 01:06:55.315
We have no intention
to ever meet there

1320
01:06:55.382 --> 01:06:57.017
or anywhere tomorrow.

1321
01:06:57.084 --> 01:06:58.653
Now, you're gonna
tell us where the fuck

1322
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.354
your goons are
keeping our friend.

1323
01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.723
Or what?

1324
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:03.190
You gonna cut off my finger?

1325
01:07:03.257 --> 01:07:05.092
Mm, something like that.

1326
01:07:06.393 --> 01:07:10.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1327
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.433
and welcome to the stage,

1328
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:19.741

(shears snipping)

1347
01:08:22.537 --> 01:08:27.575
Listen closely. I am the
big bad motherfucking wolf.

1348
01:08:27.642 --> 01:08:29.844
So you're gonna tell
me where Daisy is.

1349
01:08:29.911 --> 01:08:32.112
One chance, right now.

1350
01:08:32.446 --> 01:08:35.282
Or I'm gonna huff,
and I'm gonna huff

1351
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:38.418
and I'm gonna cut
your fucking dick off.

1352
01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:40.588
Ah.

1353
01:08:41.956 --> 01:08:45.225
You better think carefully
about your next word.

1354
01:08:45.927 --> 01:08:49.530
(soft suspenseful music)

1355
01:08:57.304 --> 01:08:59.272
There's a factory.

1356
01:09:01.075 --> 01:09:03.745
Your friend is being held

1357
01:09:04.277 --> 01:09:05.212
there.

1358
01:09:05.278 --> 01:09:06.748
What else?

1359
01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:10.551
We need location, security and
any surprises along the way.

1360
01:09:11.184 --> 01:09:13.353
Remember, if we
don't find Daisy,

1361
01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:18.593
no one is ever
going to find you.

1362
01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:21.495
Snip, snip.

1363
01:09:24.231 --> 01:09:26.266
Well, finally my bag's here.

1364
01:09:26.333 --> 01:09:29.070
At least I can get outta
these nip clips and minis.

1365
01:09:29.137 --> 01:09:30.672
No offense, guys.

1366
01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:33.273
(bag unzipping)

1367
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.575
(Ryder sighing)

1368
01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:37.444
Okay, I never, like,
literally never thought

1369
01:09:37.512 --> 01:09:40.380
I would ever utter
these words, but, Ryder,

1370
01:09:40.447 --> 01:09:43.618
you're gonna need to lend
Ezra and me something to wear.

1371
01:09:43.685 --> 01:09:45.053
No.

1372
01:09:45.119 --> 01:09:46.353
With pleasure.

1373
01:09:46.788 --> 01:09:49.557
All right, what about Koon,
what are we doing with him?

1374
01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:51.159
Well for now, he
stays locked away.

1375
01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:53.427
No one will find him until
we decide the time is right.

1376
01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.563
We could still
chop his dick off.

1377
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:58.231
Okay, ladies, let's
get the fuck out of here

1378
01:09:58.298 --> 01:09:59.834
and go bring Daisy home.

1379
01:09:59.901 --> 01:10:00.968
Let me guess.

1380
01:10:01.035 --> 01:10:02.269
No, let me.

1381
01:10:02.335 --> 01:10:03.738

1402
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.860
Okay, according to
Koon, we're not far.

1403
01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:01.129
The compound should be
just up over this ridge.

1404
01:11:01.929 --> 01:11:04.232
(sighs) Okay,
let's keep it moving.

1405
01:11:04.297 --> 01:11:07.367
(birds singing)

1406
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.605
Diamond?

1407
01:11:12.106 --> 01:11:15.009
(suspenseful music)

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.214
Diamond?

Jesus Christ.

1414
01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.086
Diamond, what have you done?

1415
01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:02.523
(Koon breathing hard)

1416
01:12:04.692 --> 01:12:06.260
Multiple countries
have tried to bring you

1417
01:12:06.326 --> 01:12:08.229
and your family down for years.

1418
01:12:08.996 --> 01:12:11.632
Millions of dollars
in resources spent,

1419
01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:15.169
and it's gonna be
these three girls

1420
01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:18.539
who single-handedly
dismantle the Thai cartel mafia.

1421
01:12:21.108 --> 01:12:22.510
How do you feel about that?

1422
01:12:22.577 --> 01:12:25.947
(Koon breathing hard)

1423
01:12:31.619 --> 01:12:35.223

(soft suspenseful music)

1425
01:12:47.034 --> 01:12:48.970
Okay, you both
understand the plan?

1426
01:12:49.971 --> 01:12:52.206
I extract, you distract.

1427
01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:53.941
Daisy, we're coming for ya.

1428
01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:55.408
All right, let's move.

1429
01:12:56.978 --> 01:12:59.547
(birds calling)

1430
01:13:03.618 --> 01:13:06.821
(suspenseful music)

1431
01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:11.359
(leaves crunching)

1432
01:13:11.424 --> 01:13:15.029
(soft suspenseful music)

1433
01:13:22.536 --> 01:13:26.007
(men shouting in Thai)

1434
01:13:30.344 --> 01:13:33.080
(engine revving)

1435
01:13:35.216 --> 01:13:38.286
Okay, Ryder's in.
Take your position.

1436
01:13:38.352 --> 01:13:40.121
Make sure to be ready for us.

1437
01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:42.723
We're gonna have to fucking
hightail it out of there.

1438
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:45.259
Diamond, I just want
you to know that I'm sorry.

1439
01:13:45.326 --> 01:13:49.462
Ezra, let's just cross this
first bridge for Daisy, okay?

1440
01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:50.965
Okay.

1441
01:14:06.647 --> 01:14:08.983
(machine squeaking)

1442
01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:14.155
(intense dramatic music)

1443
01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:37.611
(device beeping)
Okay, the charge is set.

1444
01:14:38.079 --> 01:14:40.480
(device beeping)
Charge is set.

1445
01:14:40.548 --> 01:14:42.149
(device beeping)
Charge set.

1446
01:14:43.451 --> 01:14:46.887
(devices beeping)

1447
01:14:46.954 --> 01:14:49.557
(explosions)

1448
01:14:50.725 --> 01:14:53.594
(men screaming)

1449
01:14:54.462 --> 01:14:57.999
(upbeat dramatic music)

1450
01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:07.274
(guns firing)

1451
01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.547
(gun firing)

1452
01:15:13.614 --> 01:15:16.217
(gun firing)

1453
01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:19.220
(dramatic music)

1454
01:15:21.288 --> 01:15:23.224
(gun firing)

1455
01:15:24.258 --> 01:15:26.460
(guns firing)

1456
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.231
(men shouting in Thai)

1457
01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:32.033
(grenade exploding)

1458
01:15:32.099 --> 01:15:34.835
(flames roaring)

1459
01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:39.807
(gun firing)

1460
01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.249
Finally, we meet.

1461
01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:49.450
Fuck you.

1462
01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:51.385
Spare the
impertinence, my darling.

1463
01:15:51.452 --> 01:15:53.988
Now, where's Tok Koon?

1464
01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:55.322
He's safe.

1465
01:15:55.389 --> 01:15:56.757
Safe?

1466
01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:59.126
You think you're so
beautiful, so smart.

1467
01:15:59.193 --> 01:16:01.028
You think you're a bunch
of American cowgirls,

1468
01:16:01.095 --> 01:16:03.497
you're gonna ride in
here and save the day?

1469
01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:04.899
I don't think so.

1470
01:16:04.965 --> 01:16:07.935
You know why?
Because you're nothing.

1471
01:16:08.002 --> 01:16:09.570
You're fucking nothing.

1472
01:16:12.206 --> 01:16:14.275
I would think
twice about that.

1473
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:19.280
(men shouting in Thai)

1474
01:16:20.448 --> 01:16:22.583
I got the cocksucker.

1475
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:24.351
(guns firing)

1476
01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:27.288
(men screaming)

1477
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.161
Daisy!
Ryder!

1478
01:16:34.829 --> 01:16:36.531
(attacker groaning)

1479
01:16:36.597 --> 01:16:37.731
Ryder!

1480
01:16:37.798 --> 01:16:41.102
(dramatic music)

1481
01:16:44.205 --> 01:16:46.006
(kick striking)

1482
01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:51.378
(fist thudding)

1483
01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:53.614
(man shouting)

1484
01:16:56.884 --> 01:16:58.752
(kick striking)

1485
01:17:00.287 --> 01:17:02.756
(attacker groaning)

1486
01:17:02.823 --> 01:17:05.326
(blows striking)

1487
01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:08.629
(both groaning)

1488
01:17:08.696 --> 01:17:11.665
(dramatic music)

1489
01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:25.379
(blow striking)
(body thudding)

1490
01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:26.881
(Daisy screaming)

1491
01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:29.283
Ryder!

1492
01:17:31.018 --> 01:17:32.052
Ryder.

1493
01:17:32.253 --> 01:17:33.320
Are you okay?

1494
01:17:33.387 --> 01:17:35.022
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you okay?

1495
01:17:35.089 --> 01:17:35.923
I'm fine.

1496
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.559
And what did I tell you?

1497
01:17:37.626 --> 01:17:39.493
I am a fucking badass.

1498
01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:40.794
Yes, you are.

1499
01:17:40.861 --> 01:17:43.532
Daisy, Daisy, I love you.

1500
01:17:43.598 --> 01:17:46.000
I fucking love you, Ryder.

1501
01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:48.936
(soft music)

1502
01:17:52.607 --> 01:17:55.442
Now let's get outta here.
Come on.

1503
01:17:58.312 --> 01:17:59.847
(soft music)

1504
01:17:59.914 --> 01:18:02.216
We're taking our
friend, and once we do,

1505
01:18:02.283 --> 01:18:04.586
Koon will be let
out of our custody.

1506
01:18:04.653 --> 01:18:06.153
Why should I believe you?

1507
01:18:06.253 --> 01:18:08.155
You will have double-crossed
the head of the cartel,

1508
01:18:08.222 --> 01:18:10.758
and you're gonna have a lot
more to be worried about

1509
01:18:10.824 --> 01:18:13.427
than just three cowgirls.

1510
01:18:13.494 --> 01:18:17.131
You may walk outta here
today, thinking you've won.

1511
01:18:17.198 --> 01:18:18.567
You haven't.

1512
01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:22.136
'Cause it's not about the ones
who are chasing behind you.

1513
01:18:22.203 --> 01:18:25.372
It's about the ones who are
already there ahead of you.

1514
01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:27.808
We're gonna find you, catch you,

1515
01:18:27.875 --> 01:18:29.710
and we're gonna kill all of you.

1516
01:18:29.777 --> 01:18:32.681
Revenge is gonna be sweet juice

1517
01:18:32.746 --> 01:18:34.448
that I lick off
your dead bodies.

1518
01:18:35.849 --> 01:18:37.218
Drink this.

1519
01:18:37.284 --> 01:18:38.452
(gun firing)

1520
01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.254
You asshole.

1521
01:18:40.321 --> 01:18:41.455
No!

1522
01:18:45.159 --> 01:18:46.695
[Ezra] Oh my God.
Thank God, you're okay.

1523
01:18:46.794 --> 01:18:48.929
I'm fine. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1524
01:18:48.996 --> 01:18:50.431
Please tell me you've
done your last line.

1525
01:18:50.497 --> 01:18:52.433
Good to see you too, Diamond.

1526
01:18:52.933 --> 01:18:54.868
Diamond, no!
(gun firing)

1527
01:18:54.935 --> 01:18:57.504
(soft suspenseful music)

1528
01:18:57.572 --> 01:19:00.341
(heart pounding)

1529
01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:13.120
(suspenseful music)

1530
01:19:19.293 --> 01:19:21.829
(gun firing)

1531
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.465
Go, go, go!

1532
01:19:25.499 --> 01:19:28.269
(truck engine revving)

1533
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:31.071
(engine starting)

1534
01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:35.409
(engine revving)

1535
01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.614
(truck banging)

1536
01:19:40.247 --> 01:19:43.784
I was fucking shot.
Oh, fuck!

1537
01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:44.885
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

1538
01:19:45.119 --> 01:19:46.053
Just keep pressure
on your wound.

1539
01:19:46.521 --> 01:19:48.155
Diamond, I'm really
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1540
01:19:48.222 --> 01:19:49.390
Screw it.

1541
01:19:49.591 --> 01:19:52.761
After this, you can fuck
anyone you want in my family.

1542
01:19:52.826 --> 01:19:54.862
(engine revving)

1543
01:19:54.928 --> 01:19:56.765
(lighter clicking)

1544
01:19:57.164 --> 01:19:59.033
Hasta la vista, bitches.

1545
01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:03.070
(flames roaring)

1546
01:20:03.705 --> 01:20:06.473
(engine roaring)

1547
01:20:06.541 --> 01:20:09.076
(explosion)

1548
01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:16.751
Did they get Ryder?

1549
01:20:16.817 --> 01:20:18.218
No, they didn't get Ryder.

1550
01:20:18.285 --> 01:20:20.689
That was motherfucking Ryder!

1551
01:20:20.755 --> 01:20:23.490
(engine roaring)

1552
01:20:25.192 --> 01:20:28.596
(men shouting in Thai)

1553
01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:29.664
Okay, we're almost there.

1554
01:20:29.731 --> 01:20:30.998
Almost where?

1555
01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:34.234
God, we've got company.

1556
01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:38.372
(men shouting in Thai)

1557
01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.276
(engines roaring)

1558
01:20:44.546 --> 01:20:47.381
Daisy, it's time for
a little payback.

1559
01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:50.317
Just release the
clip, aim and fire.

1560
01:20:51.553 --> 01:20:53.253
You got this, D.

1561
01:20:54.955 --> 01:20:57.391
(dramatic music)

1562
01:20:57.458 --> 01:20:59.493
(rocket firing)

1563
01:20:59.561 --> 01:21:02.363
(truck exploding)

1564
01:21:05.432 --> 01:21:08.502
(truck exploding)

1565
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.070
Fuck yeah!

1566
01:21:11.038 --> 01:21:13.575
(guns firing)

1567
01:21:13.641 --> 01:21:15.075
Oh, fuck it hurts!

1568
01:21:15.275 --> 01:21:16.644
You're gonna be fine.
I promise you're gonna be fine.

1569
01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:18.212
Just take it easy, okay.

1570
01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:19.413
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1571
01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:20.447
It's jammed!

1572
01:21:20.515 --> 01:21:22.182
Hold tight, ladies.

1573
01:21:23.417 --> 01:21:26.153
(dramatic music)

1574
01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:29.591
(engine roaring)

1575
01:21:29.657 --> 01:21:32.426
(dramatic music)

1576
01:21:39.734 --> 01:21:41.935
(tires squealing)

1577
01:21:54.448 --> 01:21:55.482
Ah.

1578
01:21:57.886 --> 01:22:00.187
You almost fucking
got away with it.

1579
01:22:00.254 --> 01:22:02.122
You almost rode off
into the sunset.

1580
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:04.491
And what makes you
think we haven't?

1581
01:22:04.559 --> 01:22:06.260
Look around you, Cowgirl.

1582
01:22:06.326 --> 01:22:09.329
Remember?
I warned you.

1583
01:22:10.164 --> 01:22:11.999
You sure did.

1584
01:22:12.399 --> 01:22:15.135
(dramatic music)

1585
01:22:16.136 --> 01:22:17.806
Yeehaw, motherfucker.

1586
01:22:17.872 --> 01:22:20.608
(dramatic music)

1587
01:22:24.579 --> 01:22:27.047
All right, everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

1588
01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:28.315
(officers shouting)

1589
01:22:28.449 --> 01:22:30.951
[Officer] Get down!
Move! Get down!

1590
01:22:32.186 --> 01:22:34.021
[Officer] Stay down,
motherfucker!

1591
01:22:34.087 --> 01:22:37.458
(officers shouting)

1592
01:22:37.525 --> 01:22:40.294
(dramatic music)

1593
01:23:16.898 --> 01:23:18.232
Ladies, welcome aboard.

1594
01:23:18.365 --> 01:23:21.201
I'll be your pilot,
Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm.

1595
01:23:22.302 --> 01:23:25.305
(upbeat pulsing music)

1596
01:23:49.764 --> 01:23:51.265
(engine roaring)

1597
01:23:51.331 --> 01:23:56.036
Was this like the best
girls trip ever or what?

1598
01:23:56.103 --> 01:23:58.205
Actually, yes.

1599
01:23:58.272 --> 01:23:59.507
By the way, when
did the two of you

1600
01:23:59.574 --> 01:24:01.174
start munching on each other?

1601
01:24:01.241 --> 01:24:02.309
(both laughing)

1602
01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:03.778
Diamond, shut up.
They're cute.

1603
01:24:03.845 --> 01:24:05.513
I mean, they might be in love.

1604
01:24:06.113 --> 01:24:07.682
You're not wrong.

1605
01:24:08.181 --> 01:24:10.150
Seriously, for
better or worse,

1606
01:24:10.217 --> 01:24:11.653
this is the trip
I'll never forget.

1607
01:24:11.719 --> 01:24:13.555
I mean, Ezra just
took a fucking bullet,

1608
01:24:13.621 --> 01:24:15.990
repaired her broken
relationship with Diamond,

1609
01:24:16.056 --> 01:24:18.960
and Diamond for once in her
life has actually found someone

1610
01:24:19.027 --> 01:24:20.427
she likes more than herself.

1611
01:24:21.796 --> 01:24:25.132
And I, for once,
can be the real me.

1612
01:24:26.768 --> 01:24:27.969
(lips smacking)

1613
01:24:28.736 --> 01:24:30.872
[Jasper] Allow me,
just a little toast.

1614
01:24:30.939 --> 01:24:32.507
Yes.

1615
01:24:34.207 --> 01:24:35.777
There we go.

1616
01:24:37.612 --> 01:24:40.147
Ladies, to an inspiring
group of heroes.

1617
01:24:40.213 --> 01:24:42.750
Heroes? Fuck that,
we are Sheroes.

1618
01:24:43.585 --> 01:24:46.119
[Group] Sheroes!
