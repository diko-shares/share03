There was another Beowulf

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:44.423
With her dead and cold in the bog,

716
01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:48.010
is it not enough
to return one monster's head?

717
01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:51.221
Did you kill her?

718
01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:56.602
Would you like to hear the story of my
struggle against this monstrous hag?

719
01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.145
(SCOFFS)

720
01:04:58.353 --> 01:05:02.316
She's no hag, Beowulf.
We both know that.

721
01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:07.446
But answer me, did you kill her?

722
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:17.831
Would I have been able to escape her,
had I not?

723
01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:29.009
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

724
01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.720
He can bother me no more.

725
01:05:32.513 --> 01:05:37.601
The mother, "the hag,"
she's not my curse.

726
01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:41.021
Not anymore.

727
01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:44.108
Not anymore.

728
01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.278
HROTHGAR: Listen to me!

729
01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:50.197
Listen to me!

730
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.830
Because my Lord Beowulf
is a mighty hero

731
01:05:57.913 --> 01:06:02.251
and because
he killed the demon Grendel

732
01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:04.878
and laid its mother in her grave...

733
01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:07.631
MAN 1: To Beowulf!
MAN 2: Long live Beowulf!

734
01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:10.884
...and because I have no heir,

735
01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:14.888
I have no sons,

736
01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.852
I declare that on my death,

737
01:06:19.935 --> 01:06:23.063
all that I possess, my kingdom,

738
01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:27.151
my hall of sadness and shame,

739
01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:31.613
and even my lovely young Queen,

740
01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:35.325
my Wealthow,

741
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.832
everything, everything

742
01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:50.007
I leave to this, our hero.

743
01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:52.426
- But, my Lord...
- I have spoken!

744
01:06:55.304 --> 01:06:56.805
I have spoken!

745
01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:02.769
When I am gone,

746
01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:07.399
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,
shall be king!

747
01:07:08.108 --> 01:07:09.443
(LAUGHING)

748
01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:18.619
Beowulf!

749
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.791
UNFERTH: My Lord.

750
01:07:26.293 --> 01:07:28.712
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

751
01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:44.728
Hrothgar!

752
01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:52.986
He must have fallen.

753
01:08:24.351 --> 01:08:29.189
- All hail King Beowulf.
- ALL: All hail King Beowulf.

754
01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:31.608
All hail King Beowulf.

755
01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.321
King Beowulf.

756
01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.150
Archers.

757
01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:15.068
MAN: Archers!

758
01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:22.909
(SCREAMING)

759
01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:39.092
(GROANS)

760
01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.852
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

761
01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.771
This is slaughter.

762
01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:56.193
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

763
01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.487
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

764
01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.614
It's going to be a short song.

765
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.157
Now, can you blame them?

766
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.992
Your legend is known
from the high seas

767
01:10:04.076 --> 01:10:06.328
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

768
01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:08.330
You are the monster slayer.

769
01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:10.832
We men are the monsters now.

770
01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:15.670
The time of heroes is dead, Wiglaf.

771
01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:19.049
The Christ God has killed it,

772
01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:24.221
leaving humankind with nothing
but weeping martyrs,

773
01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:27.057
fear and shame.

774
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.144
MAN: Show me to Beowulf!
Show me to King Beowulf!

775
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:34.064
Come on, Frisian. Speak up!

776
01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.649
BEOWULF: Leave him!

777
01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:39.736
You think it sport
to mock your opponents in this fashion?

778
01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.198
Let him die quickly,
with some honor still intact.

779
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.033
Coward!

780
01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.744
Kill me yourself!

781
01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:51.415
WIGLAF: Balls! The king
must never engage in direct battle.

782
01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:54.626
Kill the invader now! Do it quickly!
Put his head on a spear.

783
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:55.877
Stop!

784
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:09.599
My Lord, the king
must not engage in direct battle.

785
01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:14.020
Let him up.

786
01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:21.820
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

787
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.660
You think it should end with me killed
by some Frisian raider with no name?

788
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:36.585
I'm Finn of Frisia

789
01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:39.796
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

790
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.965
Only if you kill me!

791
01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:45.927
Otherwise, you're nothing.

792
01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:51.391
You think you're the first to try to kill me,
or the hundredth?

793
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:56.062
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

794
01:11:56.146 --> 01:11:59.566
The gods will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

795
01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:04.237
The gods will not allow me to die
by a sword, or be taken by the sea.

796
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:08.658
The gods will not let me
pass in my sleep, ripe with age!

797
01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:15.832
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.
Take my life.

798
01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:19.044
Someone give him a sword, or I'll...

799
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.964
You'll what? Kill me?

800
01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:28.261
Well, kill me! Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

801
01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:48.615
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

802
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:55.121
'Cause I died many, many years ago
when I was young.

803
01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.922
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

804
01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:06.132
He has a story to tell.

805
01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:36.788
Your Majesty?

806
01:13:37.581 --> 01:13:39.082
Are you hurt?

807
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.294
Not a scratch.

808
01:13:49.551 --> 01:13:51.636
So beautiful.

809
01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:54.806
And so young.

810
01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:58.393
You know, Ursula, when I was young,

811
01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:02.522
I used to think being a king
was about battling every morning

812
01:14:02.606 --> 01:14:05.191
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon

813
01:14:05.275 --> 01:14:08.528
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

814
01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:15.035
But now, well, nothing is as good
as it should have been.

815
01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:20.707
Not even the "swiving a beautiful woman
every night" part, Your Majesty?

816
01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:26.379
Well, some nights, Ursula, some nights.

817
01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:29.341
Perhaps tonight?

818
01:14:29.424 --> 01:14:33.386
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

819
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.889
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

820
01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:39.392
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

821
01:14:39.476 --> 01:14:43.480
Your day.
When the Song of Beowulf is told

822
01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:46.566
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

823
01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:52.197
And the day after,
we celebrate the birth of Hallend Christ.

824
01:14:57.577 --> 01:15:00.038
I see you've survived.

825
01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.752
Alas, my Queen,

826
01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:10.423
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

827
01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:12.801
You are not a widow,

828
01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:13.927
yet.

829
01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:19.474
How comforting, my husband.

830
01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:25.355
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

831
01:15:26.106 --> 01:15:27.732

Unferth.

836
01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:35.550
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

837
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.844
I have something for the King.

838
01:16:38.678 --> 01:16:40.096
What is it?

839
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.099
I said I have something for the King.

840
01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:45.602
- Show it to me.
- I will not.

841
01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.896
You will show it to me first.

842
01:16:48.188 --> 01:16:50.064
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

843
01:16:50.148 --> 01:16:52.859
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

844
01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.319
The King

845
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.197
needs to see what?

846
01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:08.958
UNFERTH: Lost and now found.

847
01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:20.678
A gift fit for a king.

848
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.392
Do you recognize it?

849
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:32.690
Where did you find this?

850
01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:37.987
On the moors. My slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

851
01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:41.699
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

852
01:17:43.243 --> 01:17:44.661
My Lord,

853
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:47.914
isn't this...

854
01:18:01.094 --> 01:18:02.929
So, Lord Beowulf,

855
01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:13.731
it's come back to you,
after all these years.

856
01:18:14.107 --> 01:18:15.650
(CAIN WHIMPERING)

857
01:18:15.775 --> 01:18:18.444
UNFERTH: My Lord,
this is the slave who found it.

858
01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:20.780
Please, please don't kill me!

859
01:18:20.864 --> 01:18:23.950
Where did you find this treasure?

860
01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:26.953
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.
But please don't hurt me no more.

861
01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.955
- Answer your King!
- Stop!

862
01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.291
Stop.

863
01:18:38.381 --> 01:18:39.549
Where?

864
01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:43.219
Up, up on the moors.

865
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:47.974
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.
I swear.

866
01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.810
Is that all?

867
01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.148
No demon? No witch?

868
01:18:57.901 --> 01:18:59.235
No woman?

869
01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:14.667
PEOPLE: Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

870
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:20.632
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

Hail, Beowulf!</i>

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:35.563
MAN: (ECHOING)
Look at you. You're nothing,

873
01:19:35.647 --> 01:19:38.358
an empty nothing.

874
01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.234
Come forth!

875
01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:42.362
Show yourself!

876
01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:47.784
Even with all your riches,

877
01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:52.538
your kingdom, your power, your glory

878
01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:55.875
and your women.

879
01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:03.049
Which one do you think
I should kill first,

880
01:20:04.092 --> 01:20:07.470
your pretty little bedwarmer,

881
01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.306
or your wise Queen?

882
01:20:12.976 --> 01:20:14.560
What are you?

883
01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.192
I'm something you left behind,

884
01:20:22.819 --> 01:20:23.820
Father!

885
01:20:49.137 --> 01:20:51.180
Another restless night?

886
01:20:57.228 --> 01:20:59.063
It's all right, girl.

887
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:01.941
I'm not going to eat you.

888
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:12.618
He has bad dreams.

889
01:21:13.661 --> 01:21:15.997
They've been coming more often.

890
01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:20.626
He's a king, and kings
have a lot on their conscience.

891
01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:30.344
He calls your name in his sleep.

892
01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.848
