00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:36.671
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

2
00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.264
I want mead!

3
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.666
Give me some mead, my Queen.

4
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.907
Thank you,

5
00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:52.319
my beautiful Queen.

6
00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.293
Hrothgar! Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

7
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.890
This is how it works, Aesher.

8
00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:08.826
After you die, you wouldn't
really be dead.

9
00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.033
Providing you have accepted Him,

10
00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:14.548
as the one and only God.

11
00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:26.696
Alright, back!

12
00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.279
Back!

13
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:52.172
Here, my beauty, give me a kiss.

14
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.769
I want a kiss! Give me a kiss!

15
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.775
I want a kiss!

16
00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.376
Please!
I want a kiss. I want a kiss.

17
00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.650
Stop it!

18
00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:00.682
More!

19
00:03:02.283 --> 00:03:03.083
More!

20
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.138
My thanes.

21
00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.999
My beautiful thanes!

22
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:10.759
One year ago,

23
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.826
I, Hrothgar, your King,

24
00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:15.363
swore that we would
celebrate our victories,

25
00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:17.291
in a new hall,

26
00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.036
mighty and beautiful!

27
00:03:20.002 --> 00:03:21.757
Have I not kept my oath?

28
00:03:23.572 --> 00:03:24.777
In this hall,

29
00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:28.543
we shall divide the spoils
of our conquests,

30
00:03:28.844 --> 00:03:31.246
the gold and the treasure.

31
00:03:31.347 --> 00:03:34.338
And this shall be a place of merriment,

32
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.523
joy and fornication!

33
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:43.759
From now until the end of time,

34
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.645
I name this hall...

35
00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:47.146
Herat!

36
00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:50.682
Treasure.

37
00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:53.011
Let's hand out some treasure!

38
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.004
Give me some of that!

39
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:57.478
From my conquests!

40
00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:00.610
Unferth!

41
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:02.370
For Unferth,

42
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:04.188
for Unferth,

43
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:06.649
my wisest advisor,

44
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.051
violator of virgins,

45
00:04:09.352 --> 00:04:10.512
and best,

46
00:04:10.613 --> 00:04:12.789
and bravest of brave brawlers.

47
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.593
Unferth,

48
00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:18.327
where the hell are you,
you weasel-faced bastard?

49
00:04:18.428 --> 00:04:20.371
I'm here, my King.

50
00:04:21.965 --> 00:04:23.260
Unferth, come here, you...

51
00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:25.278
ungrateful lout!

52
00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:43.253
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

53
00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:45.155
He faced a demon dragon.

54
00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:47.257
When other men would freeze.

55
00:04:47.358 --> 00:04:49.735
And then my lords he took his sword.

56
00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:51.361
And brought it to its knees.

57
00:04:51.362 --> 00:04:53.263
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

58
00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:55.169
The greatest of our kings.

59
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.133
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

60
00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:59.505
He broke the dragon's wings.

61
00:04:59.506 --> 00:05:02.106
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

62
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.244
The kingdom fell in darkness.
And shadows ruled the night.

63
00:05:07.445 --> 00:05:11.481
With no sign of dawn, he soldiered on
and brought us back to life.

64
00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:13.383
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

65
00:05:13.384 --> 00:05:15.252
He never shook your faith.

66
00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:17.187
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

67
00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:19.662
Let every cup be raised.

68
00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:23.169
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

69
00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:35.300
He offered us protection,
when monsters roamed the land.

70
00:06:35.401 --> 00:06:39.576
And one by one, he took them on,
they perished at his hand.

71
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.546
Mead!

72
00:06:43.444 --> 00:06:44.845
Mead!

73
00:06:45.813 --> 00:06:47.046
Mead!

74
00:06:47.347 --> 00:06:48.560
You're spilling it.

75
00:06:48.686 --> 00:06:50.984
Where's my mead?
You're spilling it.

76
00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.494
You're spilling it!

77
00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.189
Cain, you clumsy idiot!

78
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.329
How dare you waste the King's mead?

79
00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:12.472
He rose up like a savior,
when every hope was gone.

80
00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:14.540
The beast was gored
and peace restored.

81
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.509
His memory will live on.

82
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.244
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

83
00:07:18.245 --> 00:07:20.446
Let every cup be raised.

84
00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.181
Hrothgar! Hrothgar!

85
00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:24.659
Now and forever.

86
00:08:47.102 --> 00:08:48.125
A sword!

87
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.501
Give me a sword!

88
00:08:56.947 --> 00:08:58.649
Come!
Arm yourselves!

89
00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:02.494
Stay down, my Lady!

90
00:09:19.603 --> 00:09:20.876
Give me a sword!
My Lord!

91
00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:21.877
A sword!

92
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:08.757
No!

93
00:10:42.688 --> 00:10:43.762
Fight me!

94
00:10:45.457 --> 00:10:46.465
Fight me!

95
00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:52.005
Fight me.

96
00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:38.012
You fight me, damn you.

97
00:11:40.514 --> 00:11:41.685
Nay.

98
00:12:27.362 --> 00:12:28.281
Hrothgar!

99
00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:30.562
What was that?

100
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:34.205
Grendel.

101
00:12:44.412 --> 00:12:45.573
Grendel,

102
00:12:46.074 --> 00:12:48.084
what have you done?

103
00:12:49.184 --> 00:12:52.426
What have you done, Grendel?

104
00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:55.527
Mother.

105
00:12:59.562 --> 00:13:02.631
Fish and wolf and bear,

106
00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:04.833
and sheep or two,

107
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.075
But not men.

108
00:13:09.376 --> 00:13:10.376
Men?

109
00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:14.377
They are small.

110
00:13:16.878 --> 00:13:17.678
Here.

111
00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:21.822
Men, Grendel.

112
00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:25.993
They have slain so many of our kind.

113
00:13:27.794 --> 00:13:28.894
Men.

114
00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:32.995
They screamed!

115
00:13:35.896 --> 00:13:38.896
The men bellowed and screamed!

116
00:13:39.997 --> 00:13:42.697
The men, hurt me.

117
00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:45.798
They hurt my head.

118
00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:48.099
My ear.

119
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800
Hurt...

120
00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:53.201
my head.

121
00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:02.093
Was Hrothgar there?

122
00:14:04.794 --> 00:14:08.094
I did not hurt him. No!

123
00:14:08.295 --> 00:14:10.695
I did not hurt him. No.

124
00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:12.768
No!
No.

125
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:13.913
Good.

126
00:14:14.871 --> 00:14:16.706
Good boy.

127
00:14:17.207 --> 00:14:19.150
And tender.

128
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:22.251
Mother.

129
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.659
Men, build another pyre!

130
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.528
There's dry wood behind the stables.

131
00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:39.663
Then burn the dead.

132
00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:41.390
And seal the hall!

133
00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:43.667
Close the doors and the windows.

134
00:14:43.968 --> 00:14:45.535
And by the King's order,

135
00:14:45.736 --> 00:14:48.906
there should be no singing
or merrymaking of any kind.

136
00:14:50.341 --> 00:14:51.911
This place reeks of death.

137
00:14:54.378 --> 00:14:56.088
The scops are singing the...

138
00:14:56.114 --> 00:15:00.053
shame of Herat as far south as the middle
kingdom and as far north as the ice-lands.

139
00:15:01.953 --> 00:15:02.980
I've let it be known,

140
00:15:02.981 --> 00:15:04.120
that I will give...

141
00:15:04.121 --> 00:15:07.192
half the gold in my kingdom to any
man who can rid us of Grendel.

142
00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:09.660
My King, for deliverance

143
00:15:09.661 --> 00:15:14.198
our people sacrifice goats and sheep
to Odin and Heimdall.

144
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:16.067
With your permission,

145
00:15:16.568 --> 00:15:21.105
shall we also pray to the new
Roman god, Christ Jesus?

146
00:15:21.106 --> 00:15:24.018
Perhaps he can lift our affliction.

147
00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:27.786
No, Unferth, no.

148
00:15:28.447 --> 00:15:32.017
No, the gods will do nothing for us
that we will not do for ourselves.

149
00:15:32.618 --> 00:15:34.253
What we need is a hero.

150
00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:43.667
Hold your oars up!

151
00:15:46.332 --> 00:15:47.902
And heave!

152
00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:52.838
Can you see the coast?

153
00:15:53.364 --> 00:15:55.073
Can you see the Danes' guide-fire?

154
00:15:55.274 --> 00:15:57.343
I see nothing but the wind and the rain!

155
00:15:58.344 --> 00:16:01.480
No fire, no stars by which to navigate.

156
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:02.326
We're lost!

157
00:16:02.927 --> 00:16:04.383
Given to the sea!

158
00:16:04.384 --> 00:16:05.851
The sea's my mother!

159
00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:08.655
She'll never take me back
to her murky womb.

160
00:16:19.165 --> 00:16:21.199
My mother was a fishwife in Uppland.

161
00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.106
I was rather hoping to die in battle
as a warrior should!

162
00:16:27.374 --> 00:16:28.818
Heave!

163
00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:33.891
The men are worried
the storm has no end, Beowulf.

164
00:16:35.215 --> 00:16:37.717
It's no earthly storm,
that much is for sure.

165
00:16:37.818 --> 00:16:40.987
But this demon's tempest
will not hold us out,

166
00:16:41.288 --> 00:16:43.495
if we really want in!

167
00:16:47.328 --> 00:16:48.728
Who wants to live?

168
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:50.430
We do!

169
00:16:50.731 --> 00:16:52.481
Then pull your oars!

170
00:16:52.482 --> 00:16:53.900
Let's see you do it!

171
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:55.802
For Beowulf!

172
00:16:56.503 --> 00:16:57.971
For gold!

173
00:16:58.472 --> 00:16:59.814
For glory!

174
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:22.329
Heave!

175
00:17:23.836 --> 00:17:24.836
Heave!

176
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.340
Heave!

177
00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.570
Heave!

178
00:17:39.747 --> 00:17:40.747
Beowulf.

179
00:17:41.082 --> 00:17:42.082
Hold fast!

180
00:17:44.419 --> 00:17:45.419
No.

181
00:18:02.405 --> 00:18:03.523
Who are you?

182
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:05.975
From your dress, you are warriors.

183
00:18:06.475 --> 00:18:08.877
Speak! Why should I not run you
through right now?

184
00:18:09.078 --> 00:18:10.313
We are Geats.

185
00:18:11.614 --> 00:18:12.951
I am Beowulf,

186
00:18:12.952 --> 00:18:14.287
son of Ecgtheow.

187
00:18:15.718 --> 00:18:18.148
We come seeking your Prince Hrothgar,

188
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:19.321
in friendship.

189
00:18:19.822 --> 00:18:20.973
They say,

190
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:22.557
you have a monster here?

191
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:25.227
They say, your lands are cursed.

192
00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:26.528
Is that what they say?

193
00:18:26.529 --> 00:18:30.932
Bards sing of Hrothgar's shame from
the frozen North to the shores of Vinland.

194
00:18:31.033 --> 00:18:32.902
There's no shame
to be accursed by demons!

195
00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:34.133
I am Beowulf!

196
00:18:34.859 --> 00:18:37.274
And I am here to kill your monster.

197
00:18:40.076 --> 00:18:42.711
I thought there were no more heroes
foolish enough,

198
00:18:42.712 --> 00:18:45.081
to come around here
and die for our gold.

199
00:18:45.282 --> 00:18:48.607
If we die, it'll be for glory,

200
00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:50.331
not for gold.

201
00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:03.666
My Lord?

202
00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:05.535
My Lord?

203
00:19:05.536 --> 00:19:07.303
There are warriors outside. Geats.

204
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.368
But they are no beggars,

205
00:19:09.473 --> 00:19:11.140
and their leader Beowulf
is an imposing...

206
00:19:11.141 --> 00:19:11.945
Beowulf?

207
00:19:12.146 --> 00:19:13.284
Ecgtheow's little boy?

208
00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:16.213
Beowulf.
Where is he? Where?

209
00:19:16.314 --> 00:19:18.656
There you are.
Beowulf, welcome my boy.

210
00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:21.247
Welcome. Yes.

211
00:19:22.148 --> 00:19:23.153
How's your father?

212
00:19:23.354 --> 00:19:24.354
Dead.

213
00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:27.691
Died in battle with sea-raiders
two winters back.

214
00:19:28.092 --> 00:19:29.592
Well, he was a brave man.

215
00:19:30.094 --> 00:19:33.029
May I ask why you have come to us
from across the sea?

216
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.905
I've come to kill your monster.

217
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:39.403
And to taste that famous mead of yours.

218
00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:43.918
There have been many brave men
who have come to taste my Lord's mead.

219
00:19:46.244 --> 00:19:50.415
And many who have sworn
to rid his hall of our nightmare.

220
00:19:51.716 --> 00:19:53.038
But in the morning,

221
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:55.553
there was nothing left of any of them

222
00:19:55.554 --> 00:19:57.796
but blood to be cleaned from the floor,

223
00:19:58.957 --> 00:20:00.245
and the benches,

224
00:20:00.946 --> 00:20:02.337
and the walls.

225
00:20:07.566 --> 00:20:08.701
I have drunk...

226
00:20:09.202 --> 00:20:10.203
nothing,

227
00:20:10.704 --> 00:20:11.704
yet.

228
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.173
But I will kill your monster.

229
00:20:16.074 --> 00:20:17.520
He will kill the monster.

230
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:18.645
Did you hear that?

231
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:20.613
Grendel will die.

232
00:20:21.213 --> 00:20:22.102
Grendel?

233
00:20:22.503 --> 00:20:24.019
The monster is called Grendel.

234
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:27.653
Then I will kill your Grendel.

235
00:20:28.654 --> 00:20:30.391
I, Beowulf,

236
00:20:30.592 --> 00:20:32.857
killed a tribe of giants on the Orkneys,

237
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:35.527
crushed the skulls of sea-serpents,

238
00:20:36.228 --> 00:20:38.261
and this, this,

239
00:20:38.262 --> 00:20:40.866
troll of yours will trouble you no more.

240
00:20:41.267 --> 00:20:42.883
A hero! A hero!

241
00:20:42.884 --> 00:20:44.970
I knew the sea would bring us a hero!

242
00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:48.540
So will you go up to the moors,
to the dark pool by the cave

243
00:20:48.541 --> 00:20:50.475
and kill the monster in its den?

244
00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:53.578
I have, 14 brave thanes with me.

245
00:20:53.879 --> 00:20:55.750
We have been long at sea.

246
00:20:57.584 --> 00:20:58.919
It is high time,

247
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.470
mighty Hrothgar to...

248
00:21:00.871 --> 00:21:02.588
break open your golden mead,

249
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:04.456
famed across the world,

250
00:21:04.657 --> 00:21:05.939
and to feast,

251
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.028
in your legendary mead hall.

252
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:12.765
The mead hall has been sealed
by his Lord's order.

253
00:21:13.066 --> 00:21:16.945
Merry making in the hall
brings the devil, Grendel.

254
00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:21.818
Well, then.

255
00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:25.784
Open the mead hall!
Let's drink!

256
00:22:07.122 --> 00:22:09.466
We don't want any trouble
with the locals.

257
00:22:10.925 --> 00:22:14.562
Hondshew, make me feel
you're pretending to listen to me.

258
00:22:15.363 --> 00:22:17.931
It's only been five days
since you waved your wife goodbye.

259
00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:20.079
Five days? In the name of Odin,

260
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.303
no wonder my loins are burning!

261
00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:29.377
Beowulf, there you are.

262
00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:32.107
I was thinking about your father.

263
00:22:32.108 --> 00:22:33.108
Great man.

264
00:22:33.114 --> 00:22:34.515
He was fleeing the Wulfings

265
00:22:34.516 --> 00:22:37.117
and he'd killed one of them
with his bare hands.

266
00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:40.120
Heatholaf.
That's it, yeah. That's right.

267
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:42.105
I paid the blood debt for your father,

268
00:22:42.906 --> 00:22:44.693
and he swore his oath to me.

269
00:22:44.994 --> 00:22:49.067
So I saved his skin, and you're
here to save ours, that right?

270
00:22:56.505 --> 00:22:59.641
All hail the great Beowulf,

271
00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:04.052
come to save
our pathetic Danish skins?

272
00:23:05.948 --> 00:23:10.452
And we are so damned grateful,
mighty Beowulf.

273
00:23:10.853 --> 00:23:14.511
But can I ask a question,

274
00:23:14.512 --> 00:23:16.803
as a huge admirer of yours?

275
00:23:23.499 --> 00:23:26.970
There was another Beowulf
I heard tell of,

276
00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:32.443
who challenged Brecca the Mighty to
a swimming race out on the open sea.

277
00:23:34.244 --> 00:23:35.411
Was that you?

278
00:23:35.712 --> 00:23:37.519
I swam against Brecca.

279
00:23:42.919 --> 00:23:47.256
Because I thought
it had to be a different Beowulf,

280
00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:50.026
someone else of the same name.

281
00:23:50.227 --> 00:23:51.549
Because you see,

282
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.197
the Beowulf I heard of,

283
00:23:54.698 --> 00:23:58.373
swam against Brecca and lost.

284
00:23:59.102 --> 00:24:03.139
He risked his life and Brecca's,

285
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.743
to serve his own vanity and pride.

286
00:24:06.844 --> 00:24:09.347
A boastful fool.

287
00:24:10.014 --> 00:24:12.223
And he lost!

288
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:14.384
So...

289
00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:17.360
I thought it had to be someone else.

290
00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:23.061
I swam against Brecca.

291
00:24:23.928 --> 00:24:28.098
But victory was his, not yours.

292
00:24:28.199 --> 00:24:33.441
A mighty warrior who cannot even
win a swimming match!

293
00:24:34.872 --> 00:24:37.113
Speaking only for myself here,

294
00:24:38.743 --> 00:24:42.646
not only do I doubt that you will be
able to stand for a moment,

295
00:24:43.047 --> 00:24:44.448
against Grendel,

296
00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:49.995
I doubt that you will even have the belly
to stay in the hall all night.

297
00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:57.731
I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.

298
00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.948
But it's true,

299
00:25:02.949 --> 00:25:04.740
I did not win the race.

300
00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:08.599
We swam for five days,

301
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.341
neck and neck.

302
00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:14.445
I was conserving my strength
for the final stretch

303
00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:17.249
when this storm blew up,

304
00:25:18.317 --> 00:25:21.223
and with it came sea monsters.

305
00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:38.504
Again and again, the monsters attacked!

306
00:25:39.105 --> 00:25:42.711
Dark things from the sea's depths.

307
00:25:50.984 --> 00:25:56.154
I hacked and I lashed
at these foul beasts with my sword,

308
00:25:56.155 --> 00:25:58.760
spilling their guts into the sea.

309
00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:12.874
Beowulf!

310
00:26:20.114 --> 00:26:22.333
Then, one of them...

311
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:25.459
seized me by its jaws...

312
00:26:29.023 --> 00:26:30.764
and dragged me to the bottom.

313
00:26:57.786 --> 00:27:02.234
I killed the monster with
my own blade,

314
00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:06.632
and I plunged it into its heart.

315
00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:11.967
Yes, of course. The sea monsters.

316
00:27:13.168 --> 00:27:16.444
And you killed, what was it? 20?

317
00:27:18.373 --> 00:27:19.373
Nine.

318
00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:22.409
Last time it were three.

319
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.289
But, would you do me the honor
of telling me your name?

320
00:27:29.484 --> 00:27:30.980
I am Unferth,

321
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:33.456
son of Ecglaf.

322
00:27:34.223 --> 00:27:37.533
Unferth, son of Ecglaf.

323
00:27:39.729 --> 00:27:41.299
I know who you are.

324
00:27:42.932 --> 00:27:44.383
They say you...

325
00:27:44.584 --> 00:27:47.696
killed both your brothers when
you witnessed them having,

326
00:27:47.697 --> 00:27:49.647
knowledge of your mother.

327
00:27:51.273 --> 00:27:55.143
I have another true thing to tell you,
Unferth Kinslayer.

328
00:27:55.644 --> 00:27:57.497
If your strength and heart,

329
00:27:57.498 --> 00:27:59.915
was as strong and fierce
as your words,

330
00:28:00.216 --> 00:28:03.585
Grendel would not feel free to murder
and gorge on your people

331
00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:05.454
without fear of retaliation.

332
00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:08.090
Tonight will be different!

333
00:28:08.391 --> 00:28:11.504
Tonight, he will find Geats
waiting for him,

334
00:28:11.505 --> 00:28:13.306
not frightened sheep...

335
00:28:19.202 --> 00:28:20.240
like you.

336
00:28:26.043 --> 00:28:27.153
Well done!

337
00:28:29.813 --> 00:28:31.280
That's the spirit, Beowulf.

338
00:28:32.081 --> 00:28:33.850
That's the spirit we need.

339
00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:36.703
So you will kill my Grendel for me,

340
00:28:36.704 --> 00:28:37.622
will you?

341
00:28:41.058 --> 00:28:42.372
Well, let's all drink...

342
00:28:42.773 --> 00:28:44.617
in celebration...

343
00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:46.969
of the kill that is to come.

There.

355
00:29:41.887 --> 00:29:43.291
The Royal Dragon Horn.

356
00:29:47.426 --> 00:29:48.209
It is...

357
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.110
beautiful.

358
00:29:50.129 --> 00:29:51.930
Isn't it magnificent?

359
00:29:52.231 --> 00:29:54.699
She's the prize of my treasure.

360
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.418
I claimed her after my battle with Fafnir,

361
00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.570
the dragon of the Northern moors.

362
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:01.610
Nearly cost me my life.

363
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:05.058
And there is a soft spot under the...

364
00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:06.478
throat, there.

365
00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:08.294
See?

366
00:30:08.295 --> 00:30:10.883
You have to go in
with a knife or a dagger.

367
00:30:14.853 --> 00:30:17.060
It's the only way you can kill a dragon.

368
00:30:18.891 --> 00:30:20.091
I wonder...

369
00:30:20.434 --> 00:30:23.898
how many men have died
for love of her beauty.

370
00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:26.471
Can you blame them?

371
00:30:27.433 --> 00:30:30.236
If you destroy my Grendel for me,

372
00:30:31.404 --> 00:30:36.478
she'll be yours forever
and ever and ever.

373
00:30:38.478 --> 00:30:40.958
You do me great honor.

374
00:30:42.682 --> 00:30:44.482
It is we who are honored.

375
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.074
Is that your demon?

376
00:31:08.075 --> 00:31:08.936
That was a wolf.

377
00:31:08.937 --> 00:31:10.877
You don't hear Grendel
when he comes.

378
00:31:10.878 --> 00:31:11.671
No?

379
00:31:11.672 --> 00:31:13.513
Well, you'll hear me, I promise.

380
00:31:13.914 --> 00:31:17.751
Come on, my mighty lust limb
can transport you to paradise,

381
00:31:18.052 --> 00:31:19.619
to ecstasy and back.

382
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.589
No other man will ever be able
to satisfy you again.

383
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.357
Sorry.
Come on!

384
00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:26.207
I said no and I meant no.

385
00:31:26.208 --> 00:31:26.893
Why not?

386
00:31:26.894 --> 00:31:30.831
Because it's late and it's dark and the
monster could arrive at any moment!

387
00:31:31.332 --> 00:31:33.674
Well, then, how about a quick gobble?

388
00:31:39.473 --> 00:31:40.667
The hour...

389
00:31:40.868 --> 00:31:41.868
is upon us.

390
00:31:42.643 --> 00:31:43.771
This old man,

391
00:31:44.472 --> 00:31:45.518
needs to sleep.

392
00:31:46.514 --> 00:31:48.173
Where's my beautiful...

393
00:31:48.174 --> 00:31:50.474
bedmate? Come, my love.

394
00:31:52.921 --> 00:31:54.121
In a moment.

395
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:56.418
Come Wealthow,

396
00:31:56.619 --> 00:31:58.319
let us pound the pillows.

397
00:31:59.327 --> 00:32:00.497
Don't touch me!

398
00:32:02.797 --> 00:32:04.797
That's the spirit, my girl.

399
00:32:05.667 --> 00:32:06.709
My Lord!

400
00:32:11.906 --> 00:32:15.777
Perhaps, Her Majesty
could grace our ears with...

401
00:32:16.778 --> 00:32:18.081
one more melody,

402
00:32:18.682 --> 00:32:21.520
before we all retire?

403
00:32:26.756 --> 00:32:28.456
It's the least I can do.

404
00:32:36.332 --> 00:32:37.422
Beowulf, I'll...

405
00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:39.186
hope to see you in the morning,

406
00:32:39.487 --> 00:32:40.587
Odin willing.

407
00:32:41.337 --> 00:32:43.374
And make sure...

408
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:45.575
your thanes secure the doors.

409
00:32:46.942 --> 00:32:47.877
Good night.

410
00:32:48.878 --> 00:32:49.878
Good night.

411
00:32:51.814 --> 00:32:53.068
Good night, Beowulf.

412
00:32:53.569 --> 00:32:55.469
Watch out for sea monsters.

413
00:32:55.918 --> 00:32:59.429
I'm sure your imagination
must be teeming with them.

You need to go now, Your Majesty.

424
00:34:31.483 --> 00:34:33.183
Of course. Grendel.

425
00:34:41.126 --> 00:34:43.461
The demon is my husband's shame.

426
00:34:43.562 --> 00:34:46.035
It's not a shame, it's a curse.

427
00:34:46.598 --> 00:34:48.805
No, shame.

428
00:34:50.035 --> 00:34:51.811
My husband has no other.

No sons.

430
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.108
And he will have no more, for all his talk.

431
00:34:57.209 --> 00:34:58.690
Oy, Hondshew.

432
00:34:58.691 --> 00:35:00.278
How was she?

433
00:35:00.379 --> 00:35:02.213
Nah. Not my type.

434
00:35:02.314 --> 00:35:03.774
I know your type.

435
00:35:12.224 --> 00:35:14.071
Lord Beowulf, what are you doing?

436
00:35:15.628 --> 00:35:18.197
The creature has no sword, no armor.

437
00:35:18.798 --> 00:35:21.834
And I have no weapon
capable of slaying a monster.

438
00:35:22.335 --> 00:35:24.335
We shall fight as equals.

439
00:35:24.704 --> 00:35:26.740
And fate,

440
00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:30.181
shall decide.

441
00:35:51.297 --> 00:35:53.468
Good.
Tie it off with more chain.

442
00:35:57.605 --> 00:35:59.184
Enough frican' about!

443
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.218
You're mad, you know that?

444
00:36:11.719 --> 00:36:12.719
Yes.

445
00:36:18.592 --> 00:36:21.663
Something vexes you, my Wiglaf?

446
00:36:24.498 --> 00:36:26.398
I don't like the smell
of this one, my Lord.

447
00:36:28.602 --> 00:36:30.002
The men are unprepared.

448
00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:32.305
They're distracted.

449
00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.441
Too many untended women here!

450
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.510
Abstinence prior to battle is essential!

451
00:36:41.716 --> 00:36:44.616
A warrior's mind must be
unblurred, my Lord.

452
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.820
Good night, Wiglaf.

453
00:36:51.893 --> 00:36:53.561

what're we meant to do?

456
00:37:00.878 --> 00:37:03.138
He wants us to sing.
So sing!

Patience, patience, my love.

00:38:13.677 --> 00:38:16.054
No! Hondshew! No!

483
00:38:27.524 --> 00:38:28.932

484
00:38:28.933 --> 00:38:30.632

No pintle.
Aye.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.823
The demon shrinks!
It shrinks!

488
00:41:34.524 --> 00:41:35.593
It shrinks!

489
00:41:56.438 --> 00:41:59.475
Demon!

490
00:42:38.748 --> 00:42:40.122
Your bloodletting...

491
00:42:40.423 --> 00:42:41.945
days are finished,

492
00:42:42.246 --> 00:42:43.246
demon!

493
00:42:44.647 --> 00:42:47.647
I am not a demon!

494
00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:49.190
It speaks.

495
00:42:49.595 --> 00:42:50.665
It speaks!

496
00:42:54.331 --> 00:42:56.296

gouger.

500
00:42:59.703 --> 00:43:01.737
I am the teeth in the darkness,

501
00:43:01.738 --> 00:43:03.206
the talons in the night.

502
00:43:03.607 --> 00:43:07.076

Grendel's arm!

505
00:43:38.276 --> 00:43:39.276
You've done it!

506
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.280
He's done it!

507
00:43:44.248 --> 00:43:46.031
He's torn the limbs from the beast!

508
00:43:46.432 --> 00:43:48.496
Beowulf has killed him!

509
00:43:50.154 --> 00:43:53.256
Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

510
00:43:53.257 --> 00:43:56.059
Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

511
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.131
Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

512
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:01.978
My Lord,

513
00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.270
Beowulf has killed the demon!

514
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:06.970
Odin be praised.

515
00:44:09.207 --> 00:44:10.392
Go tell the scops.

516
00:44:10.393 --> 00:44:12.711
Spread the word!
Yes, my Lord.

517
00:44:16.081 --> 00:44:18.481
Tomorrow will be
a glorious day of rejoicing.

518
00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:21.519
Our nightmare is over.

519
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:26.190
Come to bed, my sweet.

520
00:44:29.762 --> 00:44:32.428
My kingdom needs an heir!
I need a son!

521
00:44:32.554 --> 00:44:34.332
It's time you did your duty.

522
00:44:34.533 --> 00:44:38.008
How can I ever lay with you,
knowing you laid with her?

523
00:44:41.874 --> 00:44:43.474
I should never have told you.

524
00:44:46.412 --> 00:44:48.012
I should never have told you.

525
00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:10.639
Grendel.

526
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.640
My son.

527
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.240
My poor son.

528
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:16.841
Mother.

529
00:45:19.742 --> 00:45:20.642
They...

530
00:45:21.043 --> 00:45:23.243
hurt me, Mother.

531
00:45:25.051 --> 00:45:27.427
Sleep now, my son.

532
00:45:30.328 --> 00:45:30.924
He...

533
00:45:32.025 --> 00:45:33.828
murdered me, Mother.

534
00:45:34.427 --> 00:45:36.568
Who murdered you, my son?

535
00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:39.952
He...

536
00:45:40.853 --> 00:45:42.569
ripped off my arm.

537
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:47.180
He will pay, meen darling.

538
00:45:48.281 --> 00:45:49.781
Who was the man?

539
00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:54.582
He was so strong.

540
00:45:56.383 --> 00:45:58.383
So strong.

541
00:45:58.384 --> 00:46:00.684
Who was the man?

542
00:46:01.785 --> 00:46:03.385
His...

543
00:46:06.686 --> 00:46:08.286
His...

544
00:46:10.687 --> 00:46:13.087
name was...

545
00:46:15.588 --> 00:46:16.988
Beowulf.

546
00:46:31.052 --> 00:46:32.758
Beowulf.

547
00:46:40.962 --> 00:46:43.299
They were great warriors.

548
00:46:45.901 --> 00:46:47.901
They died a foul death.

549
00:46:48.203 --> 00:46:50.603
They were murdered by a foul creature,

550
00:46:50.724 --> 00:46:52.308
from the depths of hell.

551
00:46:52.908 --> 00:46:54.337
The bards will...

552
00:46:54.338 --> 00:46:56.314
sing of their glory forever.

553
00:47:02.051 --> 00:47:03.051
Come.

554
00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:05.921
Let us drink to their memory.

555
00:47:06.022 --> 00:47:07.384
I want you to...

556
00:47:07.385 --> 00:47:08.685
raise the first cup.

557
00:47:08.925 --> 00:47:11.225
I am not in the mood
for merrymaking.

558
00:47:12.528 --> 00:47:15.028
I'll ride down to the mooring,
prepare the boat.

559
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:19.976
We still leave tomorrow, on the tide,

560
00:47:20.377 --> 00:47:21.406
do we not?

561
00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:24.139
Aye.

562
00:47:24.473 --> 00:47:27.552
My thanes, my friends, brothers,

563
00:47:29.812 --> 00:47:31.455
this place for me,

564
00:47:32.556 --> 00:47:34.756
has been a hall of sadness.

565
00:47:35.751 --> 00:47:37.119
And for all of us,

566
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.820
it has been a place of misery,
bloodshed and death.

567
00:47:41.023 --> 00:47:42.088
But today,

568
00:47:43.689 --> 00:47:45.194
the monster's reign has ended.

569
00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:48.395
They say he ripped the monster's
limb off with his bare hands.

570
00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:52.044
I wonder if Beowulf's strength
is only in his arms,

571
00:47:52.045 --> 00:47:53.645
or in his legs as well,

572
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.170
all three of them?

573
00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.140
Well, after the feast tonight,
I'm sure you can find out, Gitte.

574
00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:02.979
Me? It's not me he wants, my Queen.

575
00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.880
Bring it here!

576
00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.216
Wealthow, my love,

577
00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:11.452
why don't you, do the honors?

578
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:27.370
For you, my Lord.

579
00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:35.790
Thank you, great King.

580
00:48:41.953 --> 00:48:43.153
And all of you,

581
00:48:46.591 --> 00:48:51.105
I wish you'd have been there last night
to see me kill the monster.

582
00:48:51.496 --> 00:48:53.496
I was asleep when he arrived.

583
00:48:54.165 --> 00:48:57.135
He ripped open the doors
with his bare hands.

584
00:48:58.336 --> 00:49:01.440
He stood 20 feet tall,

585
00:49:01.441 --> 00:49:03.707
possessing the strength of 10 men.

586
00:49:03.708 --> 00:49:05.104
I looked at him...

587
00:49:05.505 --> 00:49:06.479
and said,

588
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.024
I am Beowulf!

589
00:50:51.619 --> 00:50:53.189
<i>Brave thane.</i>

590
00:50:56.056 --> 00:50:57.591
My Queen.

591
00:51:08.269 --> 00:51:09.641
<i>I love you.</i>

592
00:51:10.871 --> 00:51:12.407
<i>I want you, my King.</i>

593
00:51:13.475 --> 00:51:14.585
<i>Only you.</i>

594
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.130
<i>My hero,</i>

595
00:51:17.131 --> 00:51:18.789
<i>meen looviyend.</i>

596
00:51:20.348 --> 00:51:21.748
I don't understand.

597
00:51:23.485 --> 00:51:24.785
Where's your husband?

598
00:51:25.821 --> 00:51:26.821
<i>Dead.</i>

599
00:51:28.957 --> 00:51:29.957
Dead?

600
00:51:31.893 --> 00:51:33.793
This is a dream.

601
00:51:34.729 --> 00:51:37.099
This is not happening.
You're just a dream.

602
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.377
<i>Me, darling?</i>

603
00:51:40.178 --> 00:51:41.378
<i>A dream?</i>

604
00:51:43.038 --> 00:51:44.375
<i>Give me a child.</i>

605
00:51:45.176 --> 00:51:47.976
<i>Enter me and give me a son!</i>

606
00:52:22.445 --> 00:52:25.391
In the name of Odin!

607
00:52:26.983 --> 00:52:28.683
Is Grendel not dead?

608
00:52:30.186 --> 00:52:32.386
Has he grown his arm anew?

609
00:52:33.289 --> 00:52:34.789
It's not Grendel.

610
00:52:35.726 --> 00:52:36.758
Not Grendel?

611
00:52:36.759 --> 00:52:38.159
Then who?

612
00:52:38.362 --> 00:52:39.562
His mother.

613
00:52:41.164 --> 00:52:42.764
It's Grendel you killed.

614
00:52:43.667 --> 00:52:45.167
I had hoped his mother,

615
00:52:45.539 --> 00:52:46.721
had left the land...

616
00:52:47.122 --> 00:52:48.412
long, long ago.

617
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:52.040
How many monsters must I slay?

618
00:52:54.077 --> 00:52:55.673
Grendel's mother? Father?

619
00:52:55.774 --> 00:52:57.124
Grendel's uncle?

620
00:52:57.314 --> 00:53:00.714
Must I hack down
a whole family tree of demons?

621
00:53:00.751 --> 00:53:03.019
She is the last of them.
With her gone,

622
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:07.190
demon kind will slip back into
the darkness from whence it came.

623
00:53:07.291 --> 00:53:08.491
Where it belongs.

624
00:53:08.892 --> 00:53:10.933
And the mother's mate?

625
00:53:11.334 --> 00:53:13.334
Where is Grendel's father?

626
00:53:16.833 --> 00:53:19.323
Grendel's father can
do no harm to man.

627
00:53:24.175 --> 00:53:25.175
Beowulf,

628
00:53:26.477 --> 00:53:28.869
I was wrong to doubt you before,

629
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.870
and I shall not again.

630
00:53:31.282 --> 00:53:33.188
Yours is the blood of courage.

631
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:35.489
I beg your forgiveness.

632
00:53:38.022 --> 00:53:39.022
Granted.

633
00:53:39.924 --> 00:53:41.664
Cain! Cain!

634
00:53:51.936 --> 00:53:53.443
Take my sword.

635
00:53:53.744 --> 00:53:55.944
It belonged to my father's father.

636
00:53:56.441 --> 00:53:57.941
It's called Hrunting.

637
00:53:58.810 --> 00:53:59.935
That sword is...

638
00:54:00.336 --> 00:54:02.551
no match for demon magic.

639
00:54:03.816 --> 00:54:06.057
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

640
00:54:11.056 --> 00:54:12.516
No, I'm sorry I...

641
00:54:12.817 --> 00:54:15.495
mentioned you murdered your brothers.

642
00:54:16.528 --> 00:54:18.271
They were hasty words.

643
00:54:21.767 --> 00:54:23.254
Unferth,

644
00:54:24.155 --> 00:54:25.856
I may not return.

645
00:54:27.139 --> 00:54:30.039
Your ancestral sword
might be lost with me.

646
00:54:31.243 --> 00:54:32.922
As long as it is with you,

647
00:54:33.223 --> 00:54:35.154
it will never be lost.

648
00:54:44.457 --> 00:54:47.257
And you, mighty Wiglaf,

649
00:54:50.063 --> 00:54:51.763
are you still with me?

650
00:54:54.534 --> 00:54:55.735
To the end.

651
00:55:24.198 --> 00:55:25.198
Look.

652
00:55:30.638 --> 00:55:32.638
She's probably a water demon.

653
00:55:33.541 --> 00:55:35.575
You don't want to meet her
in her element.

654
00:55:35.676 --> 00:55:36.776
I know.

655
00:55:38.245 --> 00:55:39.645
Do you want me to go in with you?

656
00:55:41.082 --> 00:55:42.082
Good.

657
00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:44.117
I'll be here.

658
00:57:53.718 --> 00:57:55.763
I see you've brought me treasure.

659
00:58:00.991 --> 00:58:02.800
Show yourself!

660
00:58:05.429 --> 00:58:06.629
What are you?

661
00:58:55.047 --> 00:58:57.625
Are you the one they call Beowulf?

662
00:59:17.703 --> 00:59:19.403
The Bee-Wolf.

663
00:59:21.473 --> 00:59:22.573
The bear.

664
00:59:35.221 --> 00:59:37.921
Such a strong man you are.

665
00:59:39.225 --> 00:59:41.325
With the strength of a king.

666
00:59:43.496 --> 00:59:46.196
The king you will one day become.

667
00:59:49.469 --> 00:59:50.926
What do you know of me,

668
00:59:52.227 --> 00:59:53.227
demon?

669
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:57.710
I know, that underneath your glamour,

670
00:59:58.111 --> 01:00:02.111
you're as much a monster
as my son, Grendel.

671
01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.561
My glamour?

672
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.771
One needs glamour,

673
01:00:10.172 --> 01:00:12.134
to become a king.

674
01:00:14.428 --> 01:00:16.160
A man like you,

675
01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:20.171
could own the greatest tale ever sung.

676
01:00:21.268 --> 01:00:23.837
Your story would live on,

677
01:00:24.238 --> 01:00:27.238
when everything now alive,

678
01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.691
is dust.

679
01:00:37.318 --> 01:00:38.718
Beowulf.

680
01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:43.121
It has been a long time,

681
01:00:43.991 --> 01:00:46.391
since a man has come to visit me.

682
01:00:47.828 --> 01:00:49.828
I need no sword to kill you.

683
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.600
Of course you don't, my love.

684
01:00:58.273 --> 01:01:00.573
You took a son from me.

685
01:01:02.778 --> 01:01:04.360
Give me a son,

686
01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.081
brave thane.

687
01:01:08.183 --> 01:01:09.883
Stay with me.

688
01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.619
Love me.

689
01:01:15.223 --> 01:01:16.623
Love me

690
01:01:17.259 --> 01:01:20.651
and I shall weave you riches,

691
01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.642
beyond imagination.

692
01:01:24.933 --> 01:01:27.183
I shall make you,

693
01:01:28.236 --> 01:01:30.121
the greatest king,

694
01:01:30.522 --> 01:01:31.922
that ever lived.

695
01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:44.249
As long as you hold me in your heart,

696
01:01:44.787 --> 01:01:48.147
and this golden horn,

697
01:01:48.348 --> 01:01:50.428
remains in my keeping,

698
01:01:51.727 --> 01:01:53.967
you will forever be king.

699
01:01:56.933 --> 01:01:58.493
Forever strong,

700
01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:01.436
mighty,

701
01:02:02.405 --> 01:02:04.609
and all powerful.

702
01:02:06.142 --> 01:02:09.350
This I promise.

703
01:02:14.016 --> 01:02:18.726
This I swear.

704
01:02:38.442 --> 01:02:39.542
My Lord.

705
01:02:41.812 --> 01:02:43.312
It's dead, my Lady.

706
01:02:44.047 --> 01:02:45.587
When I finished off,

707
01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:47.918
Grendel's monstrous mother,

708
01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:50.219
I severed the brute's head.

709
01:02:52.222 --> 01:02:53.682
Our curse is lifted.

710
01:02:54.725 --> 01:02:57.295
Our curse is lifted.
Odin be praised!

711
01:02:57.995 --> 01:02:59.795
Beowulf be praised!

712
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.580
Our curse is lifted.

713
01:03:04.569 --> 01:03:06.002
Take this out of my sight.

714
01:03:06.703 --> 01:03:07.703
Unferth!

715
01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:10.239
Into the sea, quickly.

716
01:03:13.645 --> 01:03:15.416
I plunged Hrunting,

717
01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.117
into Grendel's mother's chest,

718
01:03:17.782 --> 01:03:21.182
and when I pulled the sword
free from her corpse,

719
01:03:21.786 --> 01:03:24.354
the creature sprang back to life,

720
01:03:24.355 --> 01:03:28.855
so I plunged the sword back into
the hag's chest and there it will stay.

721
01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:31.506
Till Ragnarok?

722
01:03:35.633 --> 01:03:39.378
And our people shall be grateful
till the Ragnarok.

723
01:03:45.611 --> 01:03:46.811
More mead, my Lord?

724
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880
Aye.

725
01:03:50.449 --> 01:03:52.314
And the drinking horn,

726
01:03:53.815 --> 01:03:54.827
do you have it?

727
01:03:55.454 --> 01:03:56.454
No.

728
01:03:58.057 --> 01:04:02.127
I knew the greedy witch desired it,
so I threw it into the swamp.

729
01:04:03.028 --> 01:04:04.963
And when she followed,
that's where I struck,

730
01:04:05.364 --> 01:04:07.264
with the mighty sword Hrunting.

731
01:04:09.535 --> 01:04:12.000
When she was dead, I looked for it, but, it was gone...

732
01:04:12.801 --> 01:04:13.801
forever.

733
01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:17.159
Then find our hero another cup,

734
01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560
my love.

735
01:04:20.279 --> 01:04:21.374
First,

736
01:04:21.375 --> 01:04:23.421
the hero and I must talk.

737
01:04:25.118 --> 01:04:26.118
Beowulf.

738
01:04:34.461 --> 01:04:36.773
So you brought back the head of Grendel.

739
01:04:38.198 --> 01:04:39.798
What about the head of the mother?

740
01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:44.170
With her dead and cold in the bog,

741
01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:46.529
is it not enough to return...

742
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.075
one monster's head?

743
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:50.709
Did you kill her?

744
01:04:52.045 --> 01:04:54.501
Would you like to hear
the story of my struggle against,

745
01:04:54.502 --> 01:04:56.252
this monstrous hag?

746
01:04:58.418 --> 01:05:00.134
She's no hag, Beowulf.

747
01:05:01.035 --> 01:05:02.435
We both know that.

748
01:05:03.356 --> 01:05:04.621
But answer me,

749
01:05:04.622 --> 01:05:06.722
did you kill her?

750
01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:15.808
Would I have been able to escape her,

751
01:05:16.509 --> 01:05:17.709
had I not?

752
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.480
Grendel is dead.
That's all that matters to me.

753
01:05:29.617 --> 01:05:31.390
He can bother me no more.

754
01:05:32.553 --> 01:05:33.519
The mother,

755
01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.069
the hag,

756
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.850
she's not my curse.

757
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.860
Not anymore.

758
01:05:42.596 --> 01:05:44.066
Not anymore.

759
01:05:46.634 --> 01:05:48.014
Listen to me!

760
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:49.903
Listen to me!

761
01:05:53.275 --> 01:05:54.284
Because,

762
01:05:54.285 --> 01:05:57.578
my Lord Beowulf is a mighty hero.

763
01:05:57.979 --> 01:05:59.358
Because he...

764
01:05:59.859 --> 01:06:02.159
killed the demon Grendel,

765
01:06:02.384 --> 01:06:04.819
and laid its mother in her grave...

766
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.788
To Beowulf!
Long live Beowulf!

767
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:10.963
Because I have no heir,

768
01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:14.328
I have no sons,

769
01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:17.985
I declare,

770
01:06:17.986 --> 01:06:19.286
that on my death,

771
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.539
all that I possess,

772
01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.140
my kingdom,

773
01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:25.050
my hall,

774
01:06:25.551 --> 01:06:27.411
of sadness and shame,

775
01:06:28.176 --> 01:06:29.279
and even my...

776
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.780
lovely young Queen,

777
01:06:33.883 --> 01:06:35.283
my Wealthow.

778
01:06:38.888 --> 01:06:39.888
Everything.

779
01:06:41.016 --> 01:06:42.116
Everything.

780
01:06:45.995 --> 01:06:48.015
I leave to this,

781
01:06:48.516 --> 01:06:49.516
our hero.

782
01:06:50.166 --> 01:06:51.966
But, my Lord...
I have spoken!

783
01:06:55.371 --> 01:06:56.771
I have spoken!

784
01:07:00.843 --> 01:07:02.143
When I am gone,

785
01:07:02.912 --> 01:07:05.688
Beowulf, son of Ecgtheow,

786
01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:07.489
shall be king!

787
01:07:17.294 --> 01:07:18.294
Beowulf!

788
01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:24.433
My Lord.

789
01:07:26.336 --> 01:07:28.336
Everything in its time, Beowulf.

790
01:07:43.153 --> 01:07:44.453
Hrothgar!

791
01:07:51.261 --> 01:07:52.761
He must have fallen.

792
01:08:24.395 --> 01:08:26.349
All hail King Beowulf.

793
01:08:26.350 --> 01:08:28.850
All hail King Beowulf.

794
01:08:29.334 --> 01:08:31.334
All hail King Beowulf.

795
01:08:34.639 --> 01:08:36.239
King Beowulf.

796
01:09:11.544 --> 01:09:12.844
Archers.

797
01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:14.722
Archers!

798
01:09:46.012 --> 01:09:47.912
This is not battle, Wiglaf.

799
01:09:49.015 --> 01:09:50.315
This is slaughter.

800
01:09:52.886 --> 01:09:55.422
The Frisians want to make
themselves heroes, my Lord.

801
01:09:56.323 --> 01:09:58.525
They want the bards
to sing of their deeds.

802
01:09:58.626 --> 01:10:00.360
It's going to be a short song.

803
01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:02.095
Now, can you blame them?

804
01:10:02.296 --> 01:10:04.130
Your legend is known from the high seas

805
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:06.466
and the snow barriers
to the great island kingdom.

806
01:10:06.467 --> 01:10:08.167
You are the monster slayer.

807
01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:10.669
We men are the monsters now.

808
01:10:12.907 --> 01:10:15.651
The time of heroes, is dead Wiglaf.

809
01:10:16.777 --> 01:10:18.477
The Christ God has killed it.

810
01:10:19.238 --> 01:10:21.404
Leaving human kind with nothing but,

811
01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:23.730
weeping martyrs...

812
01:10:23.944 --> 01:10:24.984
fear...

813
01:10:25.486 --> 01:10:26.886
and shame.

814
01:10:27.221 --> 01:10:28.870
Show me to Beowulf!

815
01:10:28.871 --> 01:10:31.191
Show me to King Beowulf!

816
01:10:31.926 --> 01:10:34.226
Come on, Frisian.
Speak up!

817
01:10:34.228 --> 01:10:35.628
Leave him!

818
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:39.367
You think it sport to mock
your opponents in this fashion?

819
01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.358
Let him die quickly,

820
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:43.161
with some honor still intact.

821
01:10:43.338 --> 01:10:44.438
Coward!

822
01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.374
Kill me yourself!

823
01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:48.839
Balls!

824
01:10:48.969 --> 01:10:51.169
The king must never
engage in direct battle.

825
01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.856
Kill the invader now!

826
01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:53.657
Do it quickly!

827
01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.780
Put his head on a spear.

828
01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:55.883
Stop!

829
01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:09.461
My Lord, the king must not
engage in direct battle.

830
01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:13.634
Let him up.

831
01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.540
You want your name
in the Song of Beowulf?

832
01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:25.778
You think it should end
with me killed by some...

833
01:11:26.179 --> 01:11:28.627
Frisian raider with no name?

834
01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:36.123
I'm Finn of Frisia,

835
01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:39.126
and my name
shall be remembered forever.

836
01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.662
Only if you kill me!

837
01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:45.966
Otherwise, you're nothing.

838
01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:47.979
You think,

839
01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:50.007
you're the first to try to kill me,

840
01:11:50.408 --> 01:11:51.642
or the hundredth?

841
01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:55.711
Well, let me tell you something, Frisian.

842
01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:57.026
The gods,

843
01:11:57.027 --> 01:11:59.615
will not allow my death
by your feeble blade.

844
01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:02.688
The gods will not allow me to die by a sword,

845
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:04.387
or be taken by the sea.

846
01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:07.320
The gods will not let me pass in my sleep,

847
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:08.634
ripe with age!

848
01:12:11.729 --> 01:12:14.398
Plant your ax here, Finn of Frisia.

849
01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:15.799
Take my life.

850
01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.205
Someone,

851
01:12:17.606 --> 01:12:18.905
give him a sword or I'll...

852
01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:21.472
You'll what?

853
01:12:21.598 --> 01:12:23.066
Kill me?

854
01:12:23.974 --> 01:12:25.205
Well, kill me!

855
01:12:25.206 --> 01:12:28.354
Do it! Kill me! Kill me!

856
01:12:45.597 --> 01:12:48.097
You know why you can't kill me,
my friend?

857
01:12:50.535 --> 01:12:51.950
Because I died many,

858
01:12:52.251 --> 01:12:54.577
many years ago when I was young.

859
01:13:01.346 --> 01:13:03.581
Give him a gold piece
and send him home.

860
01:13:04.082 --> 01:13:05.882
He has a story to tell.

861
01:13:35.314 --> 01:13:36.514
Your Majesty?

862
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:38.850
Are you hurt?

863
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.020
Not a scratch.

864
01:13:49.628 --> 01:13:51.698
So beautiful.

865
01:13:53.065 --> 01:13:54.265
And so young.

866
01:13:55.501 --> 01:13:56.866
You know, Ursula, when I...

867
01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:57.936
when I was young I...

868
01:13:58.537 --> 01:14:00.496
I used to think being
a king was about...

869
01:14:00.797 --> 01:14:02.274
battling every morning,

870
01:14:02.675 --> 01:14:04.943
and counting the gold
and loot in the afternoon,

871
01:14:05.344 --> 01:14:08.187
and swiving beautiful women
every evening.

872
01:14:10.183 --> 01:14:11.087
But now well...

873
01:14:12.188 --> 01:14:15.198
nothing, is as good as it should have been.

874
01:14:16.289 --> 01:14:20.349
Not even the swiving a beautiful woman
every night part, Your Majesty?

875
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:21.350
Well...

876
01:14:23.697 --> 01:14:25.797
Some nights Ursula, some nights.

877
01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.104
Perhaps tonight?

878
01:14:29.502 --> 01:14:32.802
No, tonight, I feel my age upon me.

879
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:35.440
Tomorrow, after the celebrations.

880
01:14:36.476 --> 01:14:39.076
We can't forget what tomorrow is,
can we now?

881
01:14:39.546 --> 01:14:40.546
Your day.

882
01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:42.782
When the Song of Beowulf is told,

883
01:14:43.617 --> 01:14:46.417
of how you lifted the darkness
from the land.

884
01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:49.067
And the day after,

885
01:14:49.564 --> 01:14:52.259
we celebrate the birth
of Hallend Christ.

886
01:14:57.632 --> 01:14:59.412
I see you've survived.

887
01:15:03.905 --> 01:15:05.705
Alas, my Queen,

888
01:15:06.807 --> 01:15:09.307
the Frisian invaders
have been pushed into the sea.

889
01:15:10.578 --> 01:15:11.978
You are not a widow,

890
01:15:12.947 --> 01:15:13.947
yet.

891
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.509
How comforting,

892
01:15:18.610 --> 01:15:19.910
my husband.

893
01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:24.906
Hail, Beowulf!

894
01:15:25.478 --> 01:15:26.778
Hail, Beowulf!

895
01:15:27.303 --> 01:15:28.703
Hail, Beowulf!

896
01:16:30.259 --> 01:16:31.359
Unferth.

897
01:16:32.562 --> 01:16:35.062
You're not celebrating
your King's glory tonight?

898
01:16:35.698 --> 01:16:37.798
I have something for the King.

899
01:16:38.735 --> 01:16:39.735
What is it?

900
01:16:40.236 --> 01:16:42.936
I said I have something for the King.

901
01:16:43.272 --> 01:16:45.172
Show it to me.
I will not.

902
01:16:45.775 --> 01:16:47.775
You will show it to me first.

903
01:16:48.277 --> 01:16:49.577
Bollocks, Wiglaf.

904
01:16:50.013 --> 01:16:53.013
I'll show it first to Beowulf.
The King needs to see it.

905
01:16:53.016 --> 01:16:53.916
The King...

906
01:16:55.048 --> 01:16:56.648
needs to see what?

907
01:17:05.529 --> 01:17:09.029
Lost and now found.

908
01:17:18.308 --> 01:17:20.208
A gift fit for a king.

909
01:17:24.481 --> 01:17:26.281
Do you recognize it?

910
01:17:30.287 --> 01:17:32.387
Where did you find this?

911
01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:37.956
On the moors, my slave Cain found it
on the barren hill where nothing grows.

912
01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:41.557
I beat him for treading near
such an unholy place.

913
01:17:43.301 --> 01:17:44.501
My Lord,

914
01:17:46.504 --> 01:17:47.504
isn't this...

915
01:18:01.152 --> 01:18:02.852
So Lord Beowulf,

916
01:18:09.127 --> 01:18:10.734
it's come back to you,

917
01:18:11.135 --> 01:18:13.935
after all these years.

918
01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:18.603
My Lord, this is the slave who found it.

919
01:18:18.604 --> 01:18:20.704
Please, please don't kill me!

920
01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:23.340
Where did you find this treasure?

921
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:25.710
I'm sorry I ran away, Master.

922
01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:27.071
But please don't hurt me no more.

923
01:18:27.113 --> 01:18:29.013
Answer your King!
Stop!

924
01:18:30.116 --> 01:18:31.116
Stop.

925
01:18:38.457 --> 01:18:39.457
Where?

926
01:18:40.559 --> 01:18:42.859
Up, up on the moors.

927
01:18:44.797 --> 01:18:46.867
But I was gonna bring it back, Master.

928
01:18:46.868 --> 01:18:47.968
I swear.

929
01:18:49.468 --> 01:18:50.568
Is that all?

930
01:18:52.605 --> 01:18:53.905
No demon?

931
01:18:54.404 --> 01:18:55.704
No witch?

932
01:18:57.977 --> 01:18:59.077
No woman?

933
01:19:10.657 --> 01:19:14.827
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!

934
01:19:14.828 --> 01:19:20.728
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

935
01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.400
Hail, Beowulf! Hail, Beowulf!
Hail, Beowulf!

936
01:19:31.111 --> 01:19:35.411
<i>Look at you.
You're nothing,</i>

937
01:19:35.715 --> 01:19:38.515
<i>an empty nothing.</i>

938
01:19:38.518 --> 01:19:40.318
<i>Come forth!</i>

939
01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:42.417
<i>Show yourself!</i>

940
01:19:44.926 --> 01:19:47.826
<i>Even with all your riches,</i>

941
01:19:48.896 --> 01:19:52.596
<i>your kingdom, your power, your glory,</i>

942
01:19:53.501 --> 01:19:55.981
<i>and your women.</i>

943
01:19:58.806 --> 01:20:02.706
<i>Which one do you think
I should kill first,</i>

944
01:20:04.178 --> 01:20:07.278
<i>your pretty little bedwarmer,</i>

945
01:20:07.615 --> 01:20:10.385
<i>or your wise Queen?</i>

946
01:20:13.054 --> 01:20:14.254
What are you?

947
01:20:18.759 --> 01:20:21.359
<i>I'm something you left behind,</i>

948
01:20:22.897 --> 01:20:23.897
Father!

949
01:20:49.224 --> 01:20:50.924
Another restless night?

950
01:20:57.299 --> 01:20:58.799
It's alright, girl.

951
01:21:00.002 --> 01:21:01.502
I'm not going to eat you.

952
01:21:10.546 --> 01:21:12.146
He has bad dreams.

953
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:15.450
They've been coming more often.

954
01:21:17.287 --> 01:21:20.287
He's a king, kings have a lot
on their conscience.

955
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:30.030
He calls your name in his sleep.

956
01:21:32.468 --> 01:21:33.768
Does he?

957
01:21:39.842 --> 01:21:40.980
I believe,

958
01:21:41.381 --> 01:21:43.581
he still holds you in his heart.

959
01:21:45.515 --> 01:21:46.515
Do you?

960
01:21:50.421 --> 01:21:52.121
I often wonder,

961
01:21:54.758 --> 01:21:56.058
what happened.

962
01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:57.360
To us?

963
01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:05.167
Too many secrets.

964
01:22:12.142 --> 01:22:13.842
God, help us.

965
01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:42.173
What?

966
01:22:42.634 --> 01:22:44.834
What do you want of me?

967
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.644
I have a message,

968
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:50.750
for my father.

969
01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.548
Tell me!

970
01:22:52.749 --> 01:22:53.826
What did this?

971
01:22:53.852 --> 01:22:55.868
I saw our whole village burn.

972
01:22:56.169 --> 01:22:58.288
Children screaming as they died!

973
01:22:58.289 --> 01:22:59.836
I saw it, Your Majesty,

974
01:22:59.837 --> 01:23:01.358
vomiting fire and smoke!

975
01:23:01.359 --> 01:23:02.251
Damn you!

976
01:23:02.552 --> 01:23:04.540
What was it?
A dragon!

977
01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:08.009
It's Unferth, my Lord!
Unferth.

978
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.185
You say a dragon did this?

979
01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:11.986
Stop!

980
01:23:14.774 --> 01:23:17.374
You had an agreement.

981
01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:19.677
You would not be harmed.

982
01:23:20.546 --> 01:23:23.446
But now the golden horn
has returned to you.

983
01:23:23.482 --> 01:23:25.882
The agreement is ended.

984
01:23:25.885 --> 01:23:26.885
Who?

985
01:23:26.987 --> 01:23:28.187
Who said that?

986
01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.663
The sins of the fathers!

987
01:23:31.624 --> 01:23:34.124
That's the last thing I heard.

988
01:23:34.794 --> 01:23:39.094
The last thing before
my family was burned alive!

989
01:23:39.298 --> 01:23:41.898
The sins of the fathers!

990
01:23:43.436 --> 01:23:45.836
Sins of the fathers!

991
01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:49.539
The sins of the fathers!

992
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.710
The sins of the fathers!

993
01:23:59.753 --> 01:24:02.653
Take up your positions along
the northern edge of the great gorge.

994
01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.690
It is our only hope, if I fail.

995
01:24:06.359 --> 01:24:07.359
My Lord.

996
01:24:11.431 --> 01:24:13.231
Don't go, I beg you!

997
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:14.500
You are free.

998
01:24:14.822 --> 01:24:16.122
I release you.

999
01:24:17.237 --> 01:24:18.256
Find a good man.

1000
01:24:18.557 --> 01:24:21.137
Bear him children.
But bear him a son.

1001
01:24:21.341 --> 01:24:23.341
I don't want anyone else.
I want you.

1002
01:24:23.343 --> 01:24:25.343
I am not the man you think me to be!

1003
01:24:26.012 --> 01:24:27.389
You're a great man!

1004
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:28.684
And a hero!

1005
01:24:28.985 --> 01:24:30.412
This I know to be true.

1006
01:24:30.417 --> 01:24:32.717
Then you are as foolish
as the rest of them!

1007
01:24:47.335 --> 01:24:49.135
Very impressive, dear.

1008
01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:52.640
But the armor suited you better
when you were younger.

1009
01:24:54.509 --> 01:24:55.809
I'm sure it did.

1010
01:25:01.148 --> 01:25:03.048
Why don't you take that poor girl

1011
01:25:03.784 --> 01:25:06.084
and live out your remaining years
in peace?

1012
01:25:07.188 --> 01:25:09.388
Let some young hero save us.

1013
01:25:10.224 --> 01:25:11.224
What and...

1014
01:25:11.926 --> 01:25:13.218
let the nightmare,

1015
01:25:13.819 --> 01:25:15.619
start all over again?

1016
01:25:17.132 --> 01:25:17.556
No.

1017
01:25:18.457 --> 01:25:21.057
I visited this horror, upon my kingdom.

1018
01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:23.770
I must be the one to finish her.

1019
01:25:24.471 --> 01:25:25.471
Her.

1020
01:25:29.578 --> 01:25:31.778
Was she so beautiful, Beowulf?

1021
01:25:34.016 --> 01:25:35.716
A beauty so costly?

1022
01:25:42.157 --> 01:25:43.157
Beautiful,

1023
01:25:43.767 --> 01:25:46.157
and full of fine promises.

1024
01:25:51.099 --> 01:25:52.499
I was weak.

1025
01:25:55.637 --> 01:25:56.837
I am sorry.

1026
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:02.210
So, so sorry.

1027
01:26:07.517 --> 01:26:10.117
I have always loved you, my Queen.

1028
01:26:13.022 --> 01:26:14.322
And I you.

1029
01:26:25.234 --> 01:26:26.734
Keep a memory of me,

1030
01:26:28.204 --> 01:26:30.804
not as a king or a hero,

1031
01:26:32.508 --> 01:26:33.708
but as a man,

1032
01:26:35.411 --> 01:26:37.311
fallible and flawed.

1033
01:26:54.565 --> 01:26:55.865
This is the place.

1034
01:26:56.634 --> 01:26:58.634
Where you slayed Grendel's mother.

1035
01:27:03.107 --> 01:27:03.950
Wiglaf,

1036
01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:06.051
I have no sons,

1037
01:27:06.977 --> 01:27:10.177
and if this demon kills me,
I have arranged with the heralds,

1038
01:27:11.448 --> 01:27:12.848
that you shall be king.

1039
01:27:12.883 --> 01:27:14.883
Don't speak of such things, my Lord.

1040
01:27:18.989 --> 01:27:20.157
Great friend,

1041
01:27:21.058 --> 01:27:22.458
there is something you should know.

1042
01:27:22.494 --> 01:27:23.452
Nay!

1043
01:27:23.453 --> 01:27:24.853
There is nothing I should know.

1044
01:27:25.363 --> 01:27:26.585
You are Beowulf.

1045
01:27:26.586 --> 01:27:28.386
Beowulf the mighty, the hero!

1046
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:30.900
The slayer and destroyer of demons!

1047
01:27:31.302 --> 01:27:33.802
Now, let us kill this flying devil
where it sleeps,

1048
01:27:33.838 --> 01:27:35.538
get on with our bloody lives!

1049
01:27:41.513 --> 01:27:43.171
Do you want me to go in with you?

1050
01:27:43.172 --> 01:27:44.213
No.

1051
01:27:46.084 --> 01:27:47.084
Good.

1052
01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:35.233
Beowulf.

1053
01:28:36.368 --> 01:28:38.968
It has been a long time.

1054
01:28:46.079 --> 01:28:47.779
Take your damned horn.

1055
01:28:48.925 --> 01:28:50.925
Leave my land in peace.

1056
01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:56.687
Too late, my love.

1057
01:29:17.878 --> 01:29:19.778
Odin's swifan balls!

1058
01:29:28.723 --> 01:29:30.123
It's heading for Herat!

1059
01:30:34.156 --> 01:30:35.756
Now!

1060
01:30:44.566 --> 01:30:45.866
Hrothgar.

1061
01:31:56.907 --> 01:31:58.037
Come on, come on!

1062
01:31:58.438 --> 01:31:59.607
Come on! Come on!

1063
01:32:11.588 --> 01:32:12.688
Damn you!

1064
01:32:19.397 --> 01:32:21.201
I'll have your lizard head,

1065
01:32:21.602 --> 01:32:22.902
on a spike!

1066
01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:35.101
No!

1067
01:36:29.486 --> 01:36:30.786
My Lord!

1068
01:37:00.217 --> 01:37:00.717
No!

1069
01:38:35.582 --> 01:38:36.535
Over here!

1070
01:38:37.061 --> 01:38:38.131
Attend the Queen.

1071
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:39.751
Attend the Queen.
Attend the Queen.

1072
01:40:23.258 --> 01:40:25.658
I told you we were too old
to be heroes.

1073
01:40:27.863 --> 01:40:29.263
Let's get you to a healer.

1074
01:40:30.065 --> 01:40:31.865
Not this time, old friend.

1075
01:40:32.768 --> 01:40:34.268
You are Beowulf.

1076
01:40:35.104 --> 01:40:37.504
A little thing like this
isn't going to finish you off.

1077
01:40:39.342 --> 01:40:42.042
Do you hear her?

1078
01:40:44.948 --> 01:40:46.148
I hear nothing.

1079
01:40:47.984 --> 01:40:50.784
Grendel's mother,
my son's mother, my...

1080
01:40:50.887 --> 01:40:52.187
No, my Lord.
My...

1081
01:40:52.689 --> 01:40:54.582
You killed Grendel's mother,

1082
01:40:54.583 --> 01:40:55.989
when we were young.

1083
01:40:57.494 --> 01:40:58.794
They sing of it.

1084
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:03.210
Too late for lies, Wiglaf.

1085
01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:06.635
Too late.

1086
01:42:14.406 --> 01:42:15.606
He was...

1087
01:42:17.275 --> 01:42:18.975
the bravest of us.

1088
01:42:23.588 --> 01:42:25.148
He was the prince...

1089
01:42:27.675 --> 01:42:28.975
of all warriors.

1090
01:42:33.096 --> 01:42:35.196
His name will live forever.

1091
01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:49.460
His song shall be sung forever.
