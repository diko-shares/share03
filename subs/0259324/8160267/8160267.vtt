00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:57.234
<i>It's said that the West
was built on legends.</i>

2
00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:01.172
<i>Tall tales that help us
make sense of things too great...</i>

3
00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:04.210
<i>... or too terrifying to believe.</i>

4
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:08.878
<i>This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.</i>

5
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.866
<i>Story goes that
every generation has one.</i>

6
00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:27.264
<i>Some damned soul,
cursed to ride the earth...</i>

7
00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:30.872
<i>... collecting on the devil's deals.</i>

8
00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:38.973
<i>Many years ago, a Ghost Rider was
sent to the village of San Venganza...</i>

9
00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:44.854
<i>... to fetch a contract
worth 1000 evil souls.</i>

10
00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:48.587
<i>But that contract was so powerful...</i>

11
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.960
<i>... he knew he could never let
the devil get his hands on it.</i>

12
00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.132
<i>So he did what no Rider
has ever done before:</i>

13
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:10.846
<i>He outran the devil himself.</i>

14
00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:18.253
<i>The thing about legends is...</i>

15
00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.855
<i>... sometimes they're true.</i>

16
00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:12.465
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

17
00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:16.339
<i>... the amazing, blazing...</i>

18
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.981
<i>... stunt cycle spectacular!</i>

19
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.099
<i>How about a big round of applause
for Barton and Johnny Blaze?</i>

20
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.476
<i>Let's hear it for them, folks!</i>

21
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:02.717
<i>You're a hotshot, ain't you, boy?</i>

22
00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:06.356
Young, think you know everything
there is to know.

23
00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:09.089
When you do things
without thinking...

24
00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:12.024
...you ain't making the choice,
the choice is making you.

25
00:04:12.303 --> 00:04:15.136
- I was just doing it for the crowd.
- We both know why you done it.

26
00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:21.307
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in a wheelchair?

27
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:26.643
Huh, hotshot?

28
00:04:58.682 --> 00:05:00.115
Hey.

29
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.412
What's wrong, Roxie?

30
00:05:07.591 --> 00:05:08.683
I'm leaving.

31
00:05:09.727 --> 00:05:10.659
What?

32
00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:13.154
My dad's sending me
to live with my mom.

33
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.733
- When?
- Soon.

34
00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.663
What about us?

35
00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:26.509
He says you're
not good enough for me.

36
00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:28.541
That you're just a phase.

37
00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:32.775
So, what are we gonna do, Johnny?

38
00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:40.517
We'll leave. We'll jump on the bike
and just keep going.

39
00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:43.484
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

40
00:05:43.727 --> 00:05:46.628
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

41
00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:50.293
Tomorrow, noon. We'll meet here.

42
00:07:21.725 --> 00:07:24.592
- Johnny Blaze.
- Yeah.

43
00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:27.359
Caught your show today.

44
00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:32.696
Just wanted to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching you ride.

45
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.164
Oh, thanks.

46
00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:37.198
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

47
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:39.231
You run a show?

48
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.178
Greatest show on earth.

49
00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:49.282
Thanks, but no thanks.

50
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:55.883
What's wrong, Johnny?

51
00:07:57.361 --> 00:07:59.488
Worried about your father?

52
00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:03.528
What do you know about that?

53
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.531
Even a blind man
could see he's sick.

54
00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:11.536
Thing about cancer
is the time it takes...

55
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.343
...the toll on the loved ones.

56
00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:18.539
Johnny...

57
00:08:19.783 --> 00:08:21.808
...what if I could help your dad?

58
00:08:23.487 --> 00:08:24.977
Yeah? How?

59
00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.755
How is not important.

60
00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:30.987
What if I could make him better...

61
00:08:32.463 --> 00:08:34.727
...give him back his health?

62
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.328
Would you be willing
to make a deal?

63
00:08:42.306 --> 00:08:43.330
Name your price.

64
00:08:47.311 --> 00:08:48.869
I'll take...

65
00:08:52.983 --> 00:08:54.610
...your soul.

66
00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:01.722
Okay.

67
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:07.261
By sunrise tomorrow, your father
will be healthy as a horse.

68
00:09:07.765 --> 00:09:11.292
All you have to do is sign.

69
00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:39.721
Oh, that'll do just fine.

70
00:09:48.072 --> 00:09:49.562
Damn.

71
00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:54.908
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

72
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:56.744
Dad?

73
00:09:58.515 --> 00:10:00.506
- You look--
- Great, right?

74
00:10:00.818 --> 00:10:03.912
Least that's what the doc said when
he looked at my x-rays this morning.

75
00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:07.483
- What are you talking about?
- I've been sick, son.

76
00:10:07.725 --> 00:10:09.989
When I finally get up
the nerve to tell you about it...

77
00:10:10.394 --> 00:10:11.759
...I'm not anymore.

78
00:10:12.563 --> 00:10:15.862
I can't explain it.
But I feel healthy as a horse.

79
00:10:16.367 --> 00:10:19.097
Now, come on, hotshot.
I got a show to do.

80
00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:22.505
Now, get my bike ready. Don't wanna
keep those people waiting.

81
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:32.045
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Barton Blaze!</i>

82
00:10:53.137 --> 00:10:56.072
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
head for the exits.</i>

83
00:10:56.507 --> 00:10:57.838
<i>Please stay calm.</i>

84
00:10:58.475 --> 00:11:02.434
Dad? Dad, it's all right, I'm here.
I'm here, it's gonna be okay.

85
00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:03.577
Dad?

86
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.644
Dad? Dad?

87
00:11:54.498 --> 00:11:56.762
You're no good to me dead.

88
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:13.445
You... . You killed him.

89
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.050
I cured his cancer.

90
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:18.954
That was the deal.

91
00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:23.456
But I couldn't let him
come between us.

92
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.218
You son of a bitch.

93
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:30.461
One day, when I need you...

94
00:12:31.802 --> 00:12:33.133
...I will come.

95
00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:36.631
Until then, I'll be... .

96
00:12:37.908 --> 00:12:39.876
I'll be watching.

97
00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:43.809
Forget about friends.

98
00:12:45.048 --> 00:12:47.243
Forget about family.

99
00:12:47.985 --> 00:12:50.545
Forget about love.

100
00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:59.252
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

101
00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:50.747
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

102
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:53.682
<i>You can't live in fear.</i>

103
00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:02.048
<i>Johnny, Johnny!
Johnny, Johnny!</i>

104
00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:04.226
<i>Johnny, Johnny!</i>

105
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.946
Yeah, Johnny! Yeah!

106
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.982
You.

107
00:15:23.974 --> 00:15:24.906
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

108
00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.167
<i>... please stay off the field
to allow paramedics through.</i>

109
00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.904
Oh, God. Oh, God. JB!

110
00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:40.689
JB, talk to me, man!

111
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:48.664
Heck, is the bike okay?

112
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:53.662
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:15:53.904 --> 00:15:56.998
The bike's fine. God.

114
00:15:59.342 --> 00:16:00.775
Thank you.

115
00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:03.278
Let's go home.

116
00:16:05.248 --> 00:16:06.875
<i>Let's hear it for him, folks.</i>

117
00:16:07.117 --> 00:16:10.678
<i>The amazing Johnny Blaze!</i>

118
00:16:32.809 --> 00:16:33.935
Yeah, come on, come on.

119
00:16:35.278 --> 00:16:37.269
Get the front end down. Damn it.

120
00:16:37.514 --> 00:16:38.742
<i>Blaze is down.</i>

121
00:16:38.982 --> 00:16:41.746
- Have you tried not crashing?
- Have you?

122
00:16:43.854 --> 00:16:46.846
Why don't you have a beer
and relax like everybody else, huh?

123
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.081
You know alcohol
gives me nightmares.

124
00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.788
To each his own.

125
00:17:01.805 --> 00:17:02.931
Oh, wait, could you go back?

126
00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:06.506
There's a howler monkey special
on Discovery Channel tonight.

127
00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.275
<i>- Guys, hey.
- We've seen big moves and crashes.</i>

128
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:12.244
<i>But ask these riders
who it is they look up to...</i>

129
00:17:12.482 --> 00:17:16.077
<i>... and the answer's a man who's not
even competing here, Johnny Blaze.</i>

130
00:17:16.453 --> 00:17:18.785
Yeah, that's because he's right here!

131
00:17:19.022 --> 00:17:20.489
<i>- greatest stunt rider of all time...</i>

132
00:17:20.891 --> 00:17:24.054
<i>... but what we don't know is how
much longer can Blaze cheat death.</i>

133
00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:27.058
<i>- Critics call it pay-per-view suicide- -
- Put the monkey show on.</i>

134
00:17:27.297 --> 00:17:29.288
Mack, the monkey show?

135
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:31.262
<i>- with no regard for his own life.</i>

136
00:17:31.501 --> 00:17:34.902
<i>They call him Mr. Invincible,
and he'll have to be at his next jump...</i>

137
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:37.038
<i>... when Johnny Blaze
will attempt to clear...</i>

138
00:17:37.274 --> 00:17:40.175
<i>... the length of a football field
from field goal to field goal.</i>

139
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:49.479
What?

140
00:17:51.154 --> 00:17:55.989
"What." You should be taking
a dirt nap after that ragdoll today.

141
00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:57.884
I got lucky.

142
00:17:58.128 --> 00:18:01.996
No, I got a hunting dog named Lucky.
He's got one eye and no nuts.

143
00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:06.461
Luck don't cover it, JB. Man, you got
an angel looking after you.

144
00:18:07.103 --> 00:18:09.298
- Yeah, maybe.
- Mack, you in?

145
00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:13.001
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

146
00:18:13.243 --> 00:18:16.041
Scoot over, ladies.
What's the ante?

147
00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.405
Five card draw.

148
00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.975
Maybe it's something else.

149
00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:07.421
There you go.

150
00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:10.129
It took you long enough.

151
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.541
I think you might be lost, boy.

152
00:19:30.654 --> 00:19:32.281
Angels only in there.

153
00:19:32.522 --> 00:19:35.116
Angels. Really?

154
00:19:36.493 --> 00:19:39.291
Yeah, really.
You got a problem with that?

155
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:42.591
As a matter of fact... .

156
00:20:00.216 --> 00:20:01.240
I do.

157
00:20:09.626 --> 00:20:12.322
Yep.
Love your neighborhood, Johnny.

158
00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:15.156
You join the
Homeowners Association yet?

159
00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:19.929
Oh, I see you still haven't gotten
a lock for your lift. That's great, great.

160
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.970
You've got a lot of expensive bikes
in here, I told you. How many times?

161
00:20:25.408 --> 00:20:28.036
Well, JB, I said it before,
I'll say it again:

162
00:20:28.278 --> 00:20:30.143
This place could use a woman's touch.

163
00:20:31.314 --> 00:20:33.976
- So could you.
- Heard that.

164
00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:40.087
All right, four out of five. Wreck
one more and you get the whole set.

165
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:46.656
Well, I'm glad to see
you found use for your books.

166
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.356
You want some jellies?

167
00:20:48.598 --> 00:20:51.465
No. I don't want
none of your stupid candy.

168
00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:58.668
I wanna talk to you about
something kind of serious.

169
00:20:59.042 --> 00:21:00.100
I'm trying to relax, Mack.

170
00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:03.437
Yeah, I understand. All right?
It's just gonna take a second.

171
00:21:09.185 --> 00:21:12.484
It's about you jumping on the
anniversary of your dad's accident.

172
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.527
Can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

173
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:21.527
<i>I want you to kick higher for me.
Can you get higher?</i>

174
00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:23.528
This jump, man, we--

175
00:21:23.767 --> 00:21:25.200
<i>Come on! Hit it!</i>

176
00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:29.430
Mack, you touch the Carpenters
or that chimp video again...

177
00:21:29.672 --> 00:21:33.631
...and we got a scrap on our hands.
- This jump is nuts. All right, man?

178
00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:36.773
I mean, field goal to field goal,
and now you're adding cars?

179
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:40.079
I mean, what are you
trying to prove?

180
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:42.377
That it's me.

181
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:44.150
That it's you?

182
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:46.054
Riding the bike.

183
00:21:46.589 --> 00:21:49.251
Of course it's you, man.
Who the hell else is it gonna be?

184
00:21:49.492 --> 00:21:51.323
You know what,
you're freaking me out.

185
00:21:51.561 --> 00:21:53.552
You're freaking me out
because you're reading...

186
00:21:53.797 --> 00:21:56.630
...this comparative exponential
religiosity crap.

187
00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:58.691
It's getting in your brain.

188
00:22:00.637 --> 00:22:02.571
I mean, what's going on, man?

189
00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:06.231
Do you believe
people get second chances?

190
00:22:06.743 --> 00:22:08.040
L-- I don't know.

191
00:22:08.244 --> 00:22:12.146
If somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake...

192
00:22:12.382 --> 00:22:14.680
...do you think that person
should have to pay for it...

193
00:22:15.118 --> 00:22:17.109
...every day
for the rest of their lives?

194
00:22:17.654 --> 00:22:20.088
Are you talking about
your daddy's accident?

195
00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:23.081
Well... .

196
00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:26.827
I'm just looking for a sign.

197
00:22:28.131 --> 00:22:29.291
What kind of sign?

198
00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:34.131
That I can take a negative
and turn it into a positive.

199
00:22:34.404 --> 00:22:36.304
That I can have a second chance too.

200
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:42.141
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

201
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.412
I'll think about it.

202
00:23:35.198 --> 00:23:38.531
I knew you were here.
I could smell your fear.

203
00:23:54.317 --> 00:23:55.750
Hello, Gressil.

204
00:23:58.254 --> 00:23:59.744
Why are you here?

205
00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:07.394
Wallow.

206
00:24:12.635 --> 00:24:14.227
And what do you want from us?

207
00:24:14.504 --> 00:24:16.802
I've come for the contract
of San Venganza.

208
00:24:18.541 --> 00:24:20.873
Legend has it that the contract
was stolen and hidden...

209
00:24:21.277 --> 00:24:23.177
...in a graveyard not far from here.

210
00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:25.210
And now you're gonna help me find it.

211
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.514
Abigor.

212
00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:34.219
And when we find it, then what?

213
00:24:34.457 --> 00:24:35.890
Then we'll take this world...

214
00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:38.793
...one city...

215
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:41.724
...at a time.

216
00:24:41.965 --> 00:24:43.830
What about Mephistopheles?

217
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.870
Don't... ever...

218
00:24:53.276 --> 00:24:55.471
...say that name.

219
00:25:00.283 --> 00:25:04.515
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze Leap of Death!</i>

220
00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:09.956
Yeah!

221
00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:16.960
Johnny B!

222
00:25:25.708 --> 00:25:27.005
Hey, JB.

223
00:25:27.944 --> 00:25:29.707
You're stepping on Karen.

224
00:25:35.018 --> 00:25:37.248
What was it
you were gonna say, Mack?

225
00:25:37.854 --> 00:25:40.721
I just ran a second check
on the ramps. They look good.

226
00:25:42.692 --> 00:25:44.592
Crowd's kind of out of control.

227
00:25:45.828 --> 00:25:48.661
Johnny, you know you don't
have to do this, don't you?

228
00:25:51.534 --> 00:25:54.002
Does this suit fit all right?
It feels a little loose.

229
00:25:55.538 --> 00:25:56.732
The suit's fine.

230
00:25:56.973 --> 00:26:00.306
Would you bring me my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

231
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.011
You can't live in fear.

232
00:26:11.988 --> 00:26:13.717
All right, we're up here on the right.

233
00:26:13.956 --> 00:26:15.787
Mr. Blaze. Amy Page, event publicity.

234
00:26:16.025 --> 00:26:18.585
- Have time for a quick interview?
- I don't know how long...

235
00:26:18.828 --> 00:26:21.661
...you been doing your job,
but Johnny Blaze don't do interviews.

236
00:26:21.898 --> 00:26:23.661
Not even for an old friend?

237
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:36.503
<i>Hey, Johnny.</i>

238
00:26:40.883 --> 00:26:42.009
Hi.

239
00:26:44.387 --> 00:26:45.411
I'll do it.

240
00:26:45.655 --> 00:26:50.888
Okay, and ready
in five, four, three, two--

241
00:26:51.094 --> 00:26:52.561
How's your dad?

242
00:26:53.763 --> 00:26:56.994
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

243
00:26:57.433 --> 00:27:00.095
No one has ever attempted
such a distance before...

244
00:27:00.536 --> 00:27:03.369
...three hundred feet
from field goal to field goal.

245
00:27:03.606 --> 00:27:05.699
What's going through your mind
right now?

246
00:27:05.942 --> 00:27:09.378
You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

247
00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:12.980
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

248
00:27:15.885 --> 00:27:18.854
Johnny, what drives somebody
to risk their life for entertainment?

249
00:27:19.088 --> 00:27:20.487
I heard you got married.

250
00:27:23.025 --> 00:27:24.788
Oh, no. No, it didn't happen.

251
00:27:25.862 --> 00:27:26.829
No?

252
00:27:29.165 --> 00:27:32.601
Most of the time the press focuses on
the crashes, the broken bones...

253
00:27:32.869 --> 00:27:34.029
...the costs of what you do.

254
00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:36.101
Are there any other costs?

255
00:27:36.506 --> 00:27:37.996
<i>- commemorating this
epic milestone...</i>

256
00:27:38.441 --> 00:27:40.739
<i>... in the life of
the world's greatest stuntman.</i>

257
00:27:41.811 --> 00:27:44.678
<i>And remember, 40 percent
of all proceeds tonight...</i>

258
00:27:44.914 --> 00:27:46.745
<i>- Yeah.
- ... go to the Barton Blaze Foundation...</i>

259
00:27:46.983 --> 00:27:50.009
<i>... dedicated to helping those in need
here in our home state... .</i>

260
00:27:50.453 --> 00:27:51.647
Okay, well... .

261
00:27:51.888 --> 00:27:54.857
Thank you for this revealing peek
into the life of Johnny Blaze.

262
00:27:55.658 --> 00:27:58.058
I'm Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

263
00:27:58.661 --> 00:27:59.628
And we're out.

264
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.129
- You're gonna stay for the jump, right?
- You know, we gotta get back.

265
00:28:04.534 --> 00:28:06.695
Plus, I never liked watching you jump.

266
00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:14.670
- Please.
- Sign this.

267
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:16.173
Roxanne?

268
00:28:23.119 --> 00:28:27.453
- Come on, just one signature.
- You need to get back to your seat.

269
00:28:29.058 --> 00:28:30.923
- You don't have to push.
- All right.

270
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.652
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say
you two had some kind of history.

271
00:28:34.997 --> 00:28:36.589
That was it, Mack.

272
00:28:37.166 --> 00:28:38.463
The sign.

273
00:28:38.868 --> 00:28:39.892
The sign?

274
00:28:42.505 --> 00:28:44.871
- Sure you don't wanna stick around?
- No.

275
00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:46.802
It hasn't started yet.

276
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:48.802
I'll buy you a doughnut.

277
00:28:49.579 --> 00:28:51.513
Come on, Roxie, it's Johnny Blaze.

278
00:28:52.215 --> 00:28:53.182
Let's go.

279
00:28:53.816 --> 00:28:55.807
Thank God you listened to me,
took the cars out.

280
00:28:56.052 --> 00:28:58.077
It would've been suicide otherwise.

281
00:28:58.521 --> 00:29:00.580
This way if you come up short, see...

282
00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:04.486
...you'll come down
on some nice, soft, green...

283
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:08.018
...grass.

284
00:29:08.264 --> 00:29:12.030
<i>Johnny Blaze will not be jumping
50 cars today as scheduled...</i>

285
00:29:12.502 --> 00:29:16.836
<i>... but instead will be leaping
six UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.</i>

286
00:29:17.073 --> 00:29:21.100
<i>Never before has any man attempted
such a death-defying stunt.</i>

287
00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:23.875
I took the cars out.

288
00:29:29.752 --> 00:29:31.549
Why? Why, JB?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

289
00:29:31.787 --> 00:29:34.517
- Because you would have thrown a fit.
- Call me old-fashioned...

290
00:29:34.757 --> 00:29:37.658
...I'm funny that way. Human sacrifice
makes me uncomfortable.

291
00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:41.189
Why, JB? Why helicopters, man?

292
00:29:42.298 --> 00:29:45.165
<i>You know what I've been
thinking about? A new stunt.</i>

293
00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:48.263
But instead of the cars
or the ring of fire...

294
00:29:49.272 --> 00:29:50.762
...a helicopter.

295
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:55.177
My dad thought it'd be cool.

296
00:29:58.581 --> 00:30:00.708
- He was right.
- Yeah.

297
00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:03.275
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

298
00:30:03.686 --> 00:30:06.211
Halfway down the ramp I want you
to hit the NOS, okay?

299
00:30:06.622 --> 00:30:07.782
Do not hit the NOS too early.

300
00:30:08.024 --> 00:30:10.549
If you hit it too early, you are screwed.
You got that?

301
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.253
Hey, JB, where's your head at, man?

302
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.858
She's probably on the interstate
by now, huh?

303
00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:26.770
How much NOS
did you put in the tanks?

304
00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:29.944
Enough to shame the space shuttle.
Chief, go ahead.

305
00:30:39.655 --> 00:30:41.623
Oh, God. He ain't gonna make it.

306
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.207
He made it!

307
00:31:05.281 --> 00:31:07.806
I told you he'd make it! Yeah, JB!

308
00:31:08.017 --> 00:31:09.882
<i>Let's hear it for him,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

309
00:31:10.119 --> 00:31:13.611
<i>Three hundred feet! A world record,
as only Johnny Blaze can do!</i>

310
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.754
Yeah! Yeah!

311
00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:24.622
Where's he going?

312
00:31:24.867 --> 00:31:27.700
I'll say one thing about the guy,
he's got guts.

313
00:31:27.937 --> 00:31:30.838
I mean, the other day I was watching
this, like, sports show--

314
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.941
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

315
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.841
Yeah, that might be a little hard.

316
00:31:43.285 --> 00:31:44.274
I made it!

317
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:49.688
- Pull over!
- Do you want me to pull over?

318
00:31:49.925 --> 00:31:51.893
- Drive.
- Driving.

319
00:31:59.935 --> 00:32:02.335
Come on, Roxie,
I need to talk to you.

320
00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:13.940
What's your name?

321
00:32:14.417 --> 00:32:16.351
- What?
- What's your name?

322
00:32:16.752 --> 00:32:18.185
Stuart!

323
00:32:19.088 --> 00:32:20.680
- Johnny.
- Hi.

324
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.915
Well, Stuart,
can you help me out here?

325
00:32:25.094 --> 00:32:26.959
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

326
00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:30.996
Johnny, look out!

327
00:32:40.476 --> 00:32:43.934
All right, I guess I see
how it's gonna be. Hang on!

328
00:33:02.498 --> 00:33:04.898
Howdy. Howdy, howdy, howdy.

329
00:33:05.167 --> 00:33:07.067
Are you trying to kill yourself?

330
00:33:07.303 --> 00:33:10.704
I wanna talk to you.
I haven't seen you in 56,000 years.

331
00:33:10.906 --> 00:33:12.305
This is crazy. You are crazy.

332
00:33:12.742 --> 00:33:14.937
I don't have time for this,
I have a story to edit.

333
00:33:15.177 --> 00:33:16.405
You could have said no.

334
00:33:17.947 --> 00:33:21.383
When they asked you to interview me,
you could have said no.

335
00:33:22.852 --> 00:33:25.912
- Move your van out of the way!
- What are you trying to say?

336
00:33:26.155 --> 00:33:29.147
Well, I'm not trying to say anything.
I'm saying that means something.

337
00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:33.260
- Sorry!
- Don't mind them, they're fine.

338
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:35.463
We are on the side of the freeway.

339
00:33:35.865 --> 00:33:39.232
Let's get some dinner.
You still like Italian?

340
00:33:42.338 --> 00:33:45.034
What's this about, Johnny?
You want some closure?

341
00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.804
Look, you were 17 and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

342
00:33:49.044 --> 00:33:50.978
I understand now
like I understood then...

343
00:33:51.213 --> 00:33:53.010
...and I have no hard feelings, none.

344
00:33:53.249 --> 00:33:57.083
That's why they call it the past, because
it's passed. It's done, it's over with.

345
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.418
Too much?

346
00:34:09.799 --> 00:34:14.065
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
the Plaza. Eight o'clock.

347
00:34:14.436 --> 00:34:15.460
Yes!

348
00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:20.334
Don't be late.

349
00:34:20.576 --> 00:34:22.510
This is a sign, Roxanne.

350
00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:24.812
There are no accidents.

351
00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:26.914
Destiny and all that.

352
00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:28.806
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

353
00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:31.281
- Can you please sign my sister's book?
- Oh, sure.

354
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.452
- 300 feet.
- We love you.

355
00:34:32.855 --> 00:34:34.117
Well, thank you.

356
00:34:34.356 --> 00:34:36.381
Three hundred feet.
Pretty neat, pretty neat.

357
00:34:36.826 --> 00:34:37.884
Right on, Johnny.

358
00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.308
Mephistopheles.

359
00:34:53.576 --> 00:34:54.838
I knew you'd come.

360
00:34:55.077 --> 00:34:57.102
Long time no see, boys.

361
00:34:58.347 --> 00:35:00.178
Where you been hiding?

362
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.349
I know why you're here.

363
00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:04.576
I know what you're after.

364
00:35:05.221 --> 00:35:07.121
It's my contract.

365
00:35:07.356 --> 00:35:08.880
They're my souls.

366
00:35:10.426 --> 00:35:12.826
We both know
you can't harm me here.

367
00:35:13.195 --> 00:35:14.856
It's my turn to lead.

368
00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:18.227
You will suffer for this.

369
00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:21.902
Now, deal with my Rider.

370
00:35:23.072 --> 00:35:24.369
Your favorite creation?

371
00:35:24.607 --> 00:35:26.199
Send your precious Rider.

372
00:35:26.909 --> 00:35:31.209
I will retire him
just like I will retire you...

373
00:35:32.248 --> 00:35:33.374
...Father.

374
00:35:44.426 --> 00:35:45.450
Thank you.

375
00:36:08.183 --> 00:36:10.083
You can't live in fear.

376
00:36:11.053 --> 00:36:13.112
You can't live in fear.

377
00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:16.620
You made that jump.
No one else made that jump.

378
00:36:17.026 --> 00:36:18.653
You're the best rider.

379
00:36:22.031 --> 00:36:24.397
You deserve a second chance.

380
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.965
She's a sign.

381
00:36:45.554 --> 00:36:47.647
<i>Johnny.</i>

382
00:37:15.584 --> 00:37:16.676
Okay.

383
00:37:47.649 --> 00:37:51.210
<i>Johnny.</i>

384
00:38:32.828 --> 00:38:34.056
You.

385
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.763
Hello, Johnny.

386
00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:39.530
Stay away from me.

387
00:38:40.269 --> 00:38:41.702
A little late for that.

388
00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:44.802
Nice bike.

389
00:38:47.409 --> 00:38:48.808
Why are you here?

390
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:52.612
Oh, I've always been here, Johnny.

391
00:38:53.248 --> 00:38:54.146
All along.

392
00:38:54.783 --> 00:38:56.273
Phoenix...

393
00:38:56.518 --> 00:38:57.576
...Denver...

394
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.048
...Houston.

395
00:38:59.721 --> 00:39:02.519
It was you. Keeping me alive.

396
00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:04.726
No. No, Johnny.

397
00:39:05.127 --> 00:39:06.458
It's all you.

398
00:39:07.396 --> 00:39:09.057
You're the best.

399
00:39:09.565 --> 00:39:12.329
And I'm your greatest fan.

400
00:39:13.168 --> 00:39:16.399
The posters, the video games...

401
00:39:16.638 --> 00:39:21.166
...the crowds screaming, chanting:

402
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.502
"Johnny.

403
00:39:23.712 --> 00:39:25.111
Johnny.

404
00:39:26.548 --> 00:39:28.106
Johnny."

405
00:39:29.885 --> 00:39:31.853
It makes me so proud.

406
00:39:33.722 --> 00:39:37.158
It's like watching an investment...

407
00:39:37.392 --> 00:39:40.361
...that keeps growing and growing...

408
00:39:40.596 --> 00:39:44.555
...until the day you cash it in.

409
00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:48.258
That day is today, Johnny.

410
00:39:49.138 --> 00:39:52.130
Find the one known as Blackheart...

411
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:54.475
...and destroy him.

412
00:39:54.743 --> 00:39:56.438
Find him yourself.

413
00:39:57.746 --> 00:39:59.111
It doesn't work like that.

414
00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:02.510
You're under contract, remember?

415
00:40:04.586 --> 00:40:06.144
If you succeed...

416
00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:09.689
...I'll return your soul.

417
00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:12.422
Yeah, I'm not doing it.

418
00:40:12.794 --> 00:40:14.853
You don't have any choice.

419
00:41:27.936 --> 00:41:29.426
Hey.

420
00:41:30.339 --> 00:41:32.739
You can't come in here.
This is private--

421
00:41:36.545 --> 00:41:37.534
Property.

422
00:41:37.779 --> 00:41:39.679
There was a cemetery here.

423
00:41:40.682 --> 00:41:42.309
Yeah, a long time ago.

424
00:41:43.585 --> 00:41:45.382
What happened to the graves?

425
00:41:47.522 --> 00:41:48.784
They moved them.

426
00:41:49.658 --> 00:41:50.556
Where?

427
00:41:53.862 --> 00:41:56.353
- I don't know.
- Who would?

428
00:41:58.834 --> 00:42:01.302
Saint Michael's church.

429
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:03.831
They're in charge of the whole thing.

430
00:42:04.706 --> 00:42:06.731
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

431
00:42:09.478 --> 00:42:11.378
That's what they keep telling me.

432
00:42:31.833 --> 00:42:32.925
God!

433
00:42:34.403 --> 00:42:35.631
Oh, no!

434
00:43:30.632 --> 00:43:31.690
Looking for someone?

435
00:43:33.669 --> 00:43:35.136
Back to hell.

436
00:43:36.338 --> 00:43:39.705
We're not gonna have a meaningful
conversation now, are we?

437
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:42.043
You're going down.

438
00:43:43.712 --> 00:43:44.838
I don't think so.

439
00:44:32.928 --> 00:44:34.327
He ain't so tough.

440
00:44:42.738 --> 00:44:45.036
Hey. Dirtbag.

441
00:44:57.786 --> 00:44:58.844
Have mercy.

442
00:44:59.121 --> 00:45:02.181
Sorry. All out of mercy.

443
00:45:16.405 --> 00:45:19.135
Help me!

444
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:16.832
Wait.

445
00:46:17.105 --> 00:46:18.970
You think I'm pretty, right?

446
00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:25.908
Oh, God.

447
00:46:31.119 --> 00:46:32.086
Give me the damn bag!

448
00:46:32.654 --> 00:46:33.780
Help!

449
00:46:35.957 --> 00:46:37.083
Help!

450
00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:49.994
Thanks.

451
00:46:54.476 --> 00:46:55.602
You.

452
00:46:55.977 --> 00:46:57.001
Guilty.

453
00:47:02.484 --> 00:47:04.884
Look into my eyes.

454
00:47:12.193 --> 00:47:15.685
Your soul is stained
by the blood of the innocent.

455
00:47:17.799 --> 00:47:19.562
Feel their pain.

456
00:47:19.834 --> 00:47:24.237
No!

457
00:47:30.845 --> 00:47:31.834
Give me your wallet!

458
00:47:36.117 --> 00:47:37.482
Let me go!

459
00:49:14.315 --> 00:49:16.078
Morning, bonehead.

460
00:50:27.422 --> 00:50:28.889
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

461
00:50:29.123 --> 00:50:31.990
I feel like my skull's on fire,
but I'm good. Thanks for the water.

462
00:50:32.226 --> 00:50:33.158
Did you see my bike?

463
00:50:35.263 --> 00:50:36.662
Did I say something funny?

464
00:50:36.998 --> 00:50:38.056
Ironic.

465
00:50:38.433 --> 00:50:41.027
We're big on irony around here.

466
00:50:42.203 --> 00:50:44.967
- It's out by the shed.
- Thanks.

467
00:50:45.206 --> 00:50:46.673
It does.

468
00:50:47.909 --> 00:50:48.807
What?

469
00:50:49.043 --> 00:50:52.444
You're wondering if your bike
looks normal? It does.

470
00:50:53.381 --> 00:50:54.973
And to answer your other questions:

471
00:50:55.216 --> 00:50:57.013
Last night did happen...

472
00:50:57.251 --> 00:50:58.946
...it wasn't a dream...

473
00:50:59.454 --> 00:51:01.445
...and it will happen again.

474
00:51:02.423 --> 00:51:03.788
Who are you?

475
00:51:04.992 --> 00:51:08.120
Question is, who are you?

476
00:51:09.764 --> 00:51:12.927
You are the Rider.
The Ghost Rider.

477
00:51:14.335 --> 00:51:17.168
Get used to it, kid.
It'll be a lot easier.

478
00:51:17.371 --> 00:51:20.306
If you don't, I got a nice cozy spot
picked out for you.

479
00:51:34.188 --> 00:51:37.749
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

480
00:51:38.459 --> 00:51:41.451
You'll need my help,
you expect to last the night.

481
00:51:41.929 --> 00:51:45.160
Last time I let a stranger help me
it didn't pan out so good.

482
00:51:45.533 --> 00:51:48.058
This ain't something
you can run from, kid.

483
00:51:48.536 --> 00:51:50.970
This day has been coming
since you made that deal.

484
00:52:00.438 --> 00:52:02.099
Congratulations.

485
00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:05.408
Your chances
just went from none to slim.

486
00:52:06.378 --> 00:52:09.404
Sources close to the investigation
say that there may be a link...

487
00:52:09.647 --> 00:52:11.581
...between what happened
here in downtown...

488
00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:13.977
...and the Broken Spoke massacre
in the desert.

489
00:52:14.386 --> 00:52:16.047
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

490
00:52:16.988 --> 00:52:18.353
And we're out.

491
00:52:20.392 --> 00:52:21.450
- Captain Dolan.
- No comment.

492
00:52:21.693 --> 00:52:24.355
Is it true they found a connection
between the massacre...

493
00:52:24.629 --> 00:52:27.097
...and last night's victim
here at the city train yards?

494
00:52:31.603 --> 00:52:32.797
No comment.

495
00:52:35.407 --> 00:52:36.465
Off the record, captain.

496
00:52:40.111 --> 00:52:41.772
Off the record?

497
00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.012
Piss off.

498
00:52:48.553 --> 00:52:50.851
The Rider is the devil's bounty hunter.

499
00:52:52.857 --> 00:52:56.122
Sent to hunt down anyone
that escapes from hell.

500
00:52:57.061 --> 00:52:59.120
Sterilize that for me.

501
00:52:59.764 --> 00:53:01.129
Sterilize.

502
00:53:06.905 --> 00:53:08.668
In the boiling water.

503
00:53:09.507 --> 00:53:10.838
Right. Okay.

504
00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.110
A little confused.

505
00:53:15.046 --> 00:53:17.412
During the day you'll be normal.

506
00:53:18.082 --> 00:53:19.549
But at night...

507
00:53:21.019 --> 00:53:22.850
...in the presence of evil...

508
00:53:23.755 --> 00:53:25.518
...the Rider takes over.

509
00:53:26.825 --> 00:53:28.417
I remember now.

510
00:53:29.027 --> 00:53:30.085
Last night.

511
00:53:33.765 --> 00:53:37.064
There was some punk...

512
00:53:37.502 --> 00:53:40.733
...and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

513
00:53:41.473 --> 00:53:43.600
...and I turned it all against him.

514
00:53:44.242 --> 00:53:45.971
The Penance Stare.

515
00:53:47.645 --> 00:53:49.943
It sears the souls of the wicked.

516
00:53:51.216 --> 00:53:53.980
It's the Ghost Rider's greatest weapon.

517
00:53:54.219 --> 00:53:56.084
All the Riders have it.

518
00:53:58.089 --> 00:54:03.117
Have there been others
with my "Ghost Rider" problem?

519
00:54:03.695 --> 00:54:05.026
Been a few.

520
00:54:05.263 --> 00:54:07.891
Last one was 150 years ago...

521
00:54:08.967 --> 00:54:11.800
...in a little town
called San Venganza.

522
00:54:13.137 --> 00:54:14.536
Nice town.

523
00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.039
Nice people.

524
00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:20.472
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

525
00:54:21.145 --> 00:54:22.908
...one deal at a time.

526
00:54:23.815 --> 00:54:27.615
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another...

527
00:54:28.019 --> 00:54:32.581
...until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

528
00:54:33.091 --> 00:54:37.585
...their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

529
00:54:38.196 --> 00:54:40.130
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

530
00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:43.861
Blackheart?

531
00:54:46.037 --> 00:54:47.971
He sent you after Blackheart?

532
00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.034
And others.

533
00:54:50.642 --> 00:54:51.802
The Hidden.

534
00:54:53.545 --> 00:54:58.744
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

535
00:54:59.551 --> 00:55:04.648
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

536
00:55:08.026 --> 00:55:10.187
You better hang around here, kid.

537
00:55:12.597 --> 00:55:15.031
They can't come
onto hallowed ground.

538
00:55:17.068 --> 00:55:18.000
Thanks.

539
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:19.930
And thanks for the info.

540
00:55:20.171 --> 00:55:23.140
I feel much better now that I know
I'm the devil's bounty hunter.

541
00:55:27.045 --> 00:55:29.980
- Where you going?
- Somebody I gotta see.

542
00:55:30.214 --> 00:55:31.977
That's a bad idea.

543
00:55:33.818 --> 00:55:35.615
It wouldn't be my first.

544
00:55:39.824 --> 00:55:41.189
Why'd you do it?

545
00:55:44.262 --> 00:55:45.991
Why'd you make the deal?

546
00:55:46.798 --> 00:55:48.026
I was a kid.

547
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.697
What'd you get in return?

548
00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.339
Heartache.

549
00:56:07.285 --> 00:56:08.343
Oh, my God.

550
00:56:16.828 --> 00:56:19.854
It's hard to describe the destruction
here this morning.

551
00:56:20.098 --> 00:56:22.225
Can I get you people
to stand back, please?

552
00:56:22.634 --> 00:56:26.001
I don't know. It seems like
something supernatural.

553
00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:28.330
Could you tell us about
the Good Samaritan?

554
00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.901
Well, I'll never forget him,
that's for sure.

555
00:56:31.643 --> 00:56:35.909
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, really thin, like bony.

556
00:56:36.147 --> 00:56:39.878
And he had this rad chopper,
it was all flames and stuff.

557
00:56:40.118 --> 00:56:45.181
Oh, and his face was a skull
and it was on fire.

558
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.257
"On fire."

559
00:56:50.862 --> 00:56:52.056
Yeah, like:

560
00:56:54.799 --> 00:56:56.198
Like that much fire.

561
00:56:56.434 --> 00:56:59.767
And I know it sounds weird,
but it looked okay on him.

562
00:56:59.971 --> 00:57:03.907
I mean, it was an edge look
but he totally pulled it off.

563
00:57:05.943 --> 00:57:07.376
Not sure what to add to that.

564
00:57:08.913 --> 00:57:11.643
I'm Roxanne Simpson on scene.

565
00:57:13.217 --> 00:57:14.115
Thanks.

566
00:57:22.126 --> 00:57:23.753
- Roxie--
- Don't.

567
00:57:24.696 --> 00:57:26.960
Now, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.

568
00:57:27.231 --> 00:57:30.132
- Last night was inexcusable.
- No apologies.

569
00:57:30.368 --> 00:57:33.166
See, you did me a favor last night...

570
00:57:33.404 --> 00:57:35.895
...because you made me think
of then and now.

571
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.665
And when you left,
yeah, it hurt like hell.

572
00:57:38.876 --> 00:57:41.003
But you know what? I got over it...

573
00:57:41.412 --> 00:57:44.313
...and I went to college,
I got a great job.

574
00:57:45.116 --> 00:57:46.674
But you, Johnny...

575
00:57:47.285 --> 00:57:48.843
...you're just the same.

576
00:57:49.854 --> 00:57:52.322
Oh, better paid, more fans...

577
00:57:52.757 --> 00:57:54.691
...but you're still just a carny.

578
00:58:00.264 --> 00:58:01.196
Yeah.

579
00:58:02.366 --> 00:58:03.697
Oh, man.

580
00:58:04.469 --> 00:58:06.130
My dad was right.

581
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.894
You were just a phase.

582
00:58:15.079 --> 00:58:16.444
That went well.

583
00:58:21.786 --> 00:58:23.913
Hey, captain! I got something.

584
00:59:22.914 --> 00:59:24.404
"End of days.

585
00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:33.051
The host can gain control
of the possessing spirit...

586
00:59:33.324 --> 00:59:37.522
...through concentration on
and manipulation of...

587
00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:41.421
...the fire element
that exists within man."

588
00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.304
I am speaking to the fire element
within me.

589
00:59:57.048 --> 01:00:01.109
Give me control
over the possessing spirit.

590
01:00:23.474 --> 01:00:24.532
- Hi.
- Hi.

591
01:00:24.942 --> 01:00:27.877
Hey, I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

592
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.214
I came to apologize.

593
01:00:33.618 --> 01:00:35.984
I'm leaving town tonight...

594
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:40.987
...and I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

595
01:00:41.392 --> 01:00:44.293
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

596
01:00:45.463 --> 01:00:48.990
It was cruel and totally untrue.

597
01:00:49.233 --> 01:00:50.894
And I feel really terrible about it.

598
01:00:51.135 --> 01:00:53.330
Please, don't. It's okay.

599
01:00:56.274 --> 01:00:57.172
Is something burning?

600
01:00:58.609 --> 01:01:02.545
Oh, that must be coming from outside.
Neighbor's hibachi.

601
01:01:02.914 --> 01:01:03.938
Bill, he just got it.

602
01:01:04.482 --> 01:01:05.881
I still have that one.

603
01:01:06.584 --> 01:01:07.516
You what?

604
01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:12.245
I have that one too.

605
01:01:21.232 --> 01:01:23.132
I remember that day.

606
01:01:24.602 --> 01:01:26.433
There were a dozen people
waiting in line...

607
01:01:26.671 --> 01:01:28.969
...and you went through
a whole roll of quarters.

608
01:01:29.607 --> 01:01:32.474
Look at my face.
You can tell I was just terrified...

609
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:35.508
...that my dad was gonna
come in any second.

610
01:01:50.494 --> 01:01:51.984
Okay, I just--

611
01:01:54.198 --> 01:01:57.395
It's just-- I think I should
walk you to your car.

612
01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:02.701
See, it's not great timing.

613
01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:09.112
You almost kill yourself
on the highway...

614
01:02:09.347 --> 01:02:11.542
...so you can ask me out
and then you don't show.

615
01:02:11.983 --> 01:02:13.416
Then you keep my picture...

616
01:02:13.651 --> 01:02:16.711
...but when I kiss you, you try to
shove me out the door. What's--?

617
01:02:17.121 --> 01:02:18.383
What's going on?

618
01:02:20.391 --> 01:02:22.723
Don't you care about me at all,
Johnny?

619
01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:27.096
You know you can talk to me.
You can tell me anything.

620
01:02:29.033 --> 01:02:30.227
Please.

621
01:02:33.237 --> 01:02:34.602
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

622
01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:39.601
Try me.

623
01:02:40.044 --> 01:02:41.375
You'll think I'm crazy.

624
01:02:41.746 --> 01:02:43.213
Maybe I am crazy.

625
01:02:43.447 --> 01:02:44.539
I hope I'm crazy.

626
01:02:44.782 --> 01:02:48.047
In my job, I've seen and heard
just about everything.

627
01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:51.650
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

628
01:02:52.723 --> 01:02:53.747
Off the record?

629
01:02:55.259 --> 01:02:56.283
Yeah.

630
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.008
I sold my soul to the devil.

631
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:20.340
And now I have to spare you.

632
01:03:22.553 --> 01:03:26.011
- Spare me from what?
- The devil, on account I work for him.

633
01:03:26.290 --> 01:03:28.349
That's why I couldn't make it to dinner.

634
01:03:30.294 --> 01:03:32.558
Because you were
working for the devil?

635
01:03:32.797 --> 01:03:34.731
Well, yeah. I'm his bounty hunter.

636
01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:38.533
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

637
01:03:38.769 --> 01:03:40.100
Whenever I'm around evil--

638
01:03:40.337 --> 01:03:45.331
Evil people, evil spirits.
- I change into... .

639
01:03:47.111 --> 01:03:48.100
What?

640
01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:54.249
Just a great big monster,
but I am learning to--

641
01:03:54.485 --> 01:03:56.578
I'm getting control of it.

642
01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:58.288
I'm trying to.

643
01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:02.688
So tonight, you'II... .

644
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:06.353
I believe so.

645
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:10.088
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea...

646
01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:13.566
...that you run on home now, Roxie.

647
01:04:17.808 --> 01:04:19.173
You're serious.

648
01:04:24.115 --> 01:04:27.175
So this is your excuse?

649
01:04:27.485 --> 01:04:31.512
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

650
01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:45.097
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

651
01:04:46.303 --> 01:04:50.364
I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true...

652
01:04:50.608 --> 01:04:53.133
...and take you to
the nearest psychiatric hospital.

653
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.277
You see, now that--

654
01:04:54.478 --> 01:04:58.574
Or I realize that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories...

655
01:04:58.816 --> 01:05:00.681
...than be honest with me...

656
01:05:01.585 --> 01:05:03.849
...and I walk out of that door...

657
01:05:04.321 --> 01:05:05.447
...forever.

658
01:05:32.283 --> 01:05:33.307
- Don't move!
- Hands up!

659
01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:36.577
Hands where we can see them!
Right over your head.

660
01:05:37.288 --> 01:05:38.516
Johnny Blaze.

661
01:05:39.924 --> 01:05:41.152
Yeah.

662
01:05:42.426 --> 01:05:45.793
Captain Jack Dolan.
This is Officer Edwards.

663
01:05:47.198 --> 01:05:48.324
You're coming with us.

664
01:05:50.467 --> 01:05:51.627
Okay.

665
01:05:56.941 --> 01:05:58.636
<i>Let's try this again.</i>

666
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:00.707
What about him,
you remember him?

667
01:06:00.945 --> 01:06:02.742
This guy was three years
from retirement...

668
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.345
...never harmed a fly.

669
01:06:04.582 --> 01:06:06.846
In fact, neither did
most of the corpses turning up...

670
01:06:07.218 --> 01:06:09.379
...since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

671
01:06:10.588 --> 01:06:12.783
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Bullshit!

672
01:06:13.257 --> 01:06:14.588
Okay, let's take a breather.

673
01:06:17.595 --> 01:06:19.358
- It's warm in here.
- Warm?

674
01:06:19.597 --> 01:06:21.360
Yeah, I'm burning up. Aren't you?

675
01:06:21.599 --> 01:06:22.691
A little.

676
01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:26.797
You want a cigarette?

677
01:06:27.471 --> 01:06:28.495
Okay.

678
01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:30.805
Mind if I do?

679
01:06:36.513 --> 01:06:37.537
Okay, that was weird.

680
01:06:40.818 --> 01:06:43.946
Look, Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

681
01:06:44.455 --> 01:06:47.253
I'm asking you to help yourself.

682
01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:50.892
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

683
01:06:51.595 --> 01:06:55.224
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

684
01:06:55.933 --> 01:06:59.801
And you provide
a very, very important civil service.

685
01:07:00.037 --> 01:07:01.868
In fact, when I finish my stunt career...

686
01:07:02.306 --> 01:07:05.571
...I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

687
01:07:05.776 --> 01:07:09.303
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

688
01:07:09.947 --> 01:07:12.006
Jesus Christ.

689
01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:17.686
You gotta let me go.
The real killer's out there.

690
01:07:18.756 --> 01:07:21.247
- Lookie here.
- But you're making a mistake.

691
01:07:21.525 --> 01:07:22.685
What've we got?

692
01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.460
Come on, move your ass!

693
01:07:25.729 --> 01:07:26.923
Blaze, riding up to meet us.

694
01:07:27.331 --> 01:07:30.562
Oh, God. Oh, please. Please,
you don't wanna put me in there.

695
01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:32.393
Sorry, the Ritz was booked.

696
01:07:38.409 --> 01:07:40.900
Oh, God.
Please, get me out of here!

697
01:07:43.881 --> 01:07:45.576
You look like that Johnny Blaze.

698
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:49.945
Yeah, yeah, I hear that a lot.

699
01:07:50.654 --> 01:07:51.951
Nah, that is you.

700
01:07:52.356 --> 01:07:54.051
- That's him!
- Yeah, it is.

701
01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:57.551
I saw you jump in the state fair
a few years ago.

702
01:07:57.828 --> 01:08:00.490
I paid 10 bucks to watch you splatter.

703
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.433
But you didn't.

704
01:08:04.668 --> 01:08:06.431
Looks like somebody's tripping out.

705
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:08.670
You might be a big shot
out there, Blaze...

706
01:08:08.906 --> 01:08:11.602
...but in here you're nothing
but a monkey in a cage!

707
01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:13.810
Now, I don't want any trouble.

708
01:08:14.011 --> 01:08:15.842
I don't want any trouble.

709
01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.412
Looks like trouble just found you.

710
01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:21.814
Nice jacket.

711
01:08:22.686 --> 01:08:23.983
Come on, man, leave him alone.

712
01:08:24.388 --> 01:08:25.355
Get lost!

713
01:08:25.522 --> 01:08:27.615
- The jacket's mine.
- Stop it!

714
01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:04.390
Nice jacket.

715
01:09:06.697 --> 01:09:08.392
Very nice.

716
01:09:28.185 --> 01:09:29.379
You.

717
01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:32.813
Innocent.

718
01:10:04.655 --> 01:10:08.113
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

719
01:10:11.061 --> 01:10:12.653
I've sinned a lot.

720
01:10:36.119 --> 01:10:37.108
Hold it!

721
01:11:14.258 --> 01:11:16.249
Where's the contract
of San Venganza?

722
01:11:16.693 --> 01:11:18.558
I don't know
what you are talking about.

723
01:11:18.795 --> 01:11:23.960
Don't lie to me! You've been protecting
it all these years, sworn to secrecy.

724
01:11:24.201 --> 01:11:26.260
Sworn to keep it
from the likes of you!

725
01:11:30.007 --> 01:11:31.736
There's an old saying:

726
01:11:32.175 --> 01:11:35.008
"Raise no more devils
than you can lay down."

727
01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:37.611
My father raised one too many.

728
01:11:45.556 --> 01:11:47.888
<i>Calling all units. Reported 10-50
in the downtown area.</i>

729
01:11:48.158 --> 01:11:49.056
<i>Proceed with caution.</i>

730
01:12:50.153 --> 01:12:51.620
He's coming for us.

731
01:12:52.022 --> 01:12:53.216
Abigor.

732
01:12:54.191 --> 01:12:55.317
You know what to do.

733
01:13:05.002 --> 01:13:07.596
<i>Rider.</i>

734
01:13:32.262 --> 01:13:36.096
I have a suspect fleeing west
on Cherry. Repeat, west on Cherry.

735
01:13:37.868 --> 01:13:40.234
<i>- That's a dead end. You got him.
- 10-4 on that.</i>

736
01:13:46.777 --> 01:13:48.142
<i>What's the suspect's location?</i>

737
01:13:48.378 --> 01:13:49.640
<i>- Up.
- What?</i>

738
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.713
The suspect is going up.

739
01:14:12.602 --> 01:14:14.035
Oh, my God.

740
01:14:28.184 --> 01:14:29.378
People, help me.

741
01:14:29.619 --> 01:14:31.052
Go, go, go!

742
01:14:31.288 --> 01:14:34.121
Surround him!
Make a perimeter! Let's go!

743
01:14:45.468 --> 01:14:46.992
<i>Come in, please.</i>

744
01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.676
- Come here!
- No!

745
01:15:03.486 --> 01:15:05.317
You're pissing me off.

746
01:15:05.989 --> 01:15:07.286
Okay, okay.

747
01:15:07.524 --> 01:15:08.582
Sorry.

748
01:15:20.337 --> 01:15:21.497
Take a right.

749
01:15:30.413 --> 01:15:32.313
You should've joined us, Rider.

750
01:15:32.515 --> 01:15:34.073
Soon we will have the contract...

751
01:15:34.317 --> 01:15:38.219
...and then you'll only be a footnote
in the history of the new hell.

752
01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.226
Time to clear the air.

753
01:15:57.207 --> 01:15:59.266
You're a slow learner,
aren't you, Rider?

754
01:16:01.044 --> 01:16:02.739
You cannot catch the wind!

755
01:16:14.357 --> 01:16:17.485
No!

756
01:16:52.328 --> 01:16:53.522
Oh, my God.

757
01:17:29.232 --> 01:17:30.460
Johnny.

758
01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:38.437
Prepare to fire!

759
01:17:42.112 --> 01:17:43.204
- Fire!
- Don't!

760
01:18:17.847 --> 01:18:19.815
Now we know his weakness.

761
01:18:52.715 --> 01:18:53.807
They know who I am.

762
01:18:54.584 --> 01:18:57.246
- Who's that?
- What? Everybody.

763
01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.611
You don't watch TV?
What's the matter with you?

764
01:19:03.726 --> 01:19:05.421
Is this thing ever gonna end?

765
01:19:05.695 --> 01:19:07.663
It'll end if you can catch him.

766
01:19:08.231 --> 01:19:09.528
What's really going on?

767
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:20.333
"Carter Slade."

768
01:19:21.444 --> 01:19:25.778
Legend has it he was
a Texas Ranger. Man of honor.

769
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:28.917
But he got greedy.

770
01:19:29.485 --> 01:19:33.888
Found himself locked up,
waiting on the gallows.

771
01:19:34.757 --> 01:19:36.554
Stranger came to see him.

772
01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:38.727
Offering freedom.

773
01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:41.625
Slade made a deal.

774
01:19:42.532 --> 01:19:44.329
Ended up a Ghost Rider.

775
01:19:44.901 --> 01:19:46.562
What's he gotta do with this?

776
01:19:46.936 --> 01:19:48.801
Remember that contract
the stranger made...

777
01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:51.264
...with the people of San Venganza?

778
01:19:51.808 --> 01:19:56.211
The story goes that Slade
was sent there to collect all the souls.

779
01:19:57.313 --> 01:19:59.873
But what he found there was so evil...

780
01:20:00.283 --> 01:20:03.548
...that he took the contract
and rode off.

781
01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.681
He stole it.

782
01:20:06.256 --> 01:20:08.884
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

783
01:20:09.859 --> 01:20:12.555
Some people say
he was buried with it.

784
01:20:12.795 --> 01:20:14.888
- Was he?
- I don't know.

785
01:20:16.299 --> 01:20:20.963
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

786
01:20:21.638 --> 01:20:25.540
That's why it's important for you to
stay away from friends and family...

787
01:20:25.775 --> 01:20:28.539
...anybody he can use against you,
because he will.

788
01:20:29.012 --> 01:20:29.944
Roxanne.

789
01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:42.415
Johnny?

790
01:20:48.665 --> 01:20:49.757
Johnny?

791
01:20:49.999 --> 01:20:51.296
God!

792
01:20:53.002 --> 01:20:54.367
Sorry! Sorry!

793
01:20:54.804 --> 01:20:55.998
Ma'am, you gave me a start.

794
01:20:56.839 --> 01:21:00.297
- I'm looking for Johnny.
- Yeah. You and me both.

795
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:02.773
- Have you heard from him?
- No.

796
01:21:03.012 --> 01:21:04.877
But I heard he got in trouble.

797
01:21:06.382 --> 01:21:08.976
He got arrested, yeah? What for?

798
01:21:09.719 --> 01:21:13.314
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

799
01:21:13.523 --> 01:21:16.287
Yeah, trust me, his career's
the least of it.

800
01:21:16.693 --> 01:21:19.491
You know, you seem like a nice lady,
and you're pretty and all...

801
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:22.289
...but we were riding the gravy train
on biscuit wheels...

802
01:21:22.532 --> 01:21:24.466
...then you showed up,
everything went to hell.

803
01:21:24.701 --> 01:21:27.295
So why don't you go back
to wherever it is you came from?

804
01:21:28.371 --> 01:21:30.703
I can't go back. Not now.

805
01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:33.573
Then tell me what the hell's going on!

806
01:21:34.444 --> 01:21:36.776
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

807
01:21:37.547 --> 01:21:39.981
Look, you don't know me...

808
01:21:40.383 --> 01:21:41.441
...but I love him.

809
01:21:41.684 --> 01:21:45.814
So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything... .

810
01:21:48.891 --> 01:21:51.451
Lately, he's been reading
these really weird books...

811
01:21:51.728 --> 01:21:53.355
...and they're messing with his mind.

812
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:57.395
He's writing stuff down and staying up
late. And he does it over here.

813
01:21:57.633 --> 01:22:00.659
You can go through this stuff,
and I don't know if it means anything.

814
01:22:10.646 --> 01:22:11.670
Where's Roxanne?

815
01:22:11.914 --> 01:22:13.973
Dude. Where've you been?
Everybody's out looking--

816
01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:17.352
- Where is she?
- She's out looking for you.

817
01:22:36.539 --> 01:22:37.563
Jesus.

818
01:22:37.807 --> 01:22:39.069
Not even close.

819
01:22:47.483 --> 01:22:48.882
You have his heart.

820
01:22:54.457 --> 01:22:56.049
Now I'm gonna break it.

821
01:22:58.828 --> 01:22:59.726
Roxanne?

822
01:23:05.501 --> 01:23:06.525
Mack.

823
01:23:09.505 --> 01:23:10.437
Roxanne.

824
01:23:19.615 --> 01:23:21.583
Look into my eyes.

825
01:23:28.925 --> 01:23:31.416
Your Penance Stare
doesn't work on me.

826
01:23:31.627 --> 01:23:33.891
I have no soul to burn.

827
01:23:35.498 --> 01:23:38.194
I guess the Caretaker
forgot to mention that, huh?

828
01:23:38.801 --> 01:23:39.927
Surprise!

829
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:42.465
He sent you to bring me back.

830
01:23:43.072 --> 01:23:44.869
I'm not going back.

831
01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:46.836
I like it here.

832
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.004
He thinks you're better than me?

833
01:23:52.248 --> 01:23:55.513
I don't know who's more pathetic,
you or him.

834
01:23:58.554 --> 01:24:02.547
Now, listen to me. And try to get it
through that thick skull of yours.

835
01:24:02.825 --> 01:24:06.124
You don't work for my father anymore.
You work for me.

836
01:24:06.696 --> 01:24:08.789
Get the contract from the Caretaker.

837
01:24:09.031 --> 01:24:13.934
Bring it to me in San Venganza
and maybe I'll spare your girl's life.

838
01:24:14.704 --> 01:24:15.966
And, Johnny...

839
01:24:20.943 --> 01:24:22.467
...don't make me wait.

840
01:24:42.598 --> 01:24:44.793
Figured you'd be back, bonehead.

841
01:24:46.102 --> 01:24:48.593
Where's the contract?
I can't end this without it.

842
01:24:51.874 --> 01:24:54.775
Just gonna have to dig
this whole damn place up myself.

843
01:24:57.813 --> 01:24:59.041
It's not there, kid.

844
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:13.194
Contract of San Venganza.

845
01:25:13.763 --> 01:25:15.094
Hell on earth.

846
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.565
Now, you're gonna have to trust me.

847
01:25:20.303 --> 01:25:21.736
And why is that?

848
01:25:22.972 --> 01:25:24.906
He may have my soul...

849
01:25:26.309 --> 01:25:28.038
...but he doesn't have my spirit.

850
01:25:34.283 --> 01:25:38.014
Any man who's got the guts
to sell his soul for love...

851
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:40.721
...got the power to change the world.

852
01:25:41.724 --> 01:25:43.282
You didn't do it for greed.

853
01:25:44.193 --> 01:25:46.058
You did it for the right reason.

854
01:25:47.029 --> 01:25:48.963
Maybe that puts God on your side.

855
01:25:49.865 --> 01:25:51.924
To him, that makes you dangerous.

856
01:25:52.168 --> 01:25:54.068
Makes you unpredictable.

857
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:57.134
That's the best thing
you can be right now.

858
01:26:00.142 --> 01:26:03.134
San Venganza's 500 miles from here.

859
01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:06.147
We better get moving.

860
01:26:08.751 --> 01:26:09.843
"We"?

861
01:26:32.041 --> 01:26:34.635
I got one last ride left in me.

862
01:26:46.288 --> 01:26:47.812
Carter Slade.

863
01:26:52.094 --> 01:26:53.618
Can you keep up?

864
01:27:02.338 --> 01:27:03.862
Let's ride.

865
01:27:48.417 --> 01:27:50.442
Stick to the shadows.

866
01:28:08.738 --> 01:28:11.036
This is end of the trail for me.

867
01:28:11.774 --> 01:28:13.332
I got nothing left.

868
01:28:14.176 --> 01:28:17.907
I could only change one more time,
and I was saving it for this.

869
01:28:22.785 --> 01:28:25.481
God knows I've made
my share of mistakes.

870
01:28:26.889 --> 01:28:29.414
Been trying to make things right
ever since.

871
01:28:31.026 --> 01:28:35.360
Guess all I can do now is hope he
sees fit to give me a second chance.

872
01:28:36.265 --> 01:28:37.323
Thank you.

873
01:28:37.867 --> 01:28:39.232
No.

874
01:28:39.535 --> 01:28:41.059
Thank you, kid.

875
01:29:57.112 --> 01:29:58.170
Surprise.

876
01:31:12.988 --> 01:31:14.012
Stop.

877
01:31:14.256 --> 01:31:16.451
You change, she dies.

878
01:31:18.093 --> 01:31:18.991
Do it, Johnny.

879
01:31:27.336 --> 01:31:28.598
Let her go first.

880
01:32:26.061 --> 01:32:27.494
Looks like you're out of time.

881
01:32:59.428 --> 01:33:02.363
"This is the contract of San Venganza.

882
01:33:06.101 --> 01:33:07.398
All of you...

883
01:33:08.203 --> 01:33:10.671
...come to me!"

884
01:34:06.662 --> 01:34:07.686
Johnny!

885
01:34:22.277 --> 01:34:25.735
My name is Legion...

886
01:34:27.483 --> 01:34:29.280
...for we are...

887
01:34:30.652 --> 01:34:34.611
...many.

888
01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:38.625
Let's go. He got what he wanted.

889
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:45.462
You go. I gotta get him to
the shadows. I gotta end this.

890
01:34:46.368 --> 01:34:48.131
Why? Why you?

891
01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:51.168
It's been me since the day
I made the deal.

892
01:34:51.373 --> 01:34:54.240
I'm the only one
who can walk in both worlds.

893
01:34:54.743 --> 01:34:56.233
I'm Ghost Rider.

894
01:35:00.716 --> 01:35:01.648
Run!

895
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:13.553
Come on, you son of a bitch.

896
01:35:36.518 --> 01:35:37.678
All of your world...

897
01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.717
...all of your souls...

898
01:35:39.955 --> 01:35:42.549
...will be mine now.

899
01:35:56.972 --> 01:35:58.633
- Throw me the gun!
- It's out!

900
01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:01.399
Throw it!

901
01:36:59.868 --> 01:37:03.269
How does it feel to have
all that evil inside of you?

902
01:37:03.505 --> 01:37:04.767
All their power.

903
01:37:05.974 --> 01:37:07.874
All their souls.

904
01:37:08.877 --> 01:37:11.311
A thousand souls to burn.

905
01:37:11.546 --> 01:37:13.946
Look into my eyes.

906
01:37:14.383 --> 01:37:17.750
Your souls are stained
by the blood of the innocent.

907
01:37:20.055 --> 01:37:21.613
Feel their pain.

908
01:37:32.934 --> 01:37:35.334
- Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

909
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:36.628
Kill you!

910
01:37:40.409 --> 01:37:41.501
Stop it!

911
01:37:44.012 --> 01:37:45.309
Oh, God!

912
01:38:25.787 --> 01:38:27.049
Monster.

913
01:38:28.657 --> 01:38:30.022
I'm not afraid.

914
01:38:55.150 --> 01:38:57.380
Congratulations, Johnny.

915
01:38:58.820 --> 01:39:01.118
You upheld your end of the bargain.

916
01:39:02.758 --> 01:39:05.784
It's time I take back
the power of the Ghost Rider.

917
01:39:06.995 --> 01:39:08.758
You get your life back.

918
01:39:09.798 --> 01:39:11.595
The love you've always wanted.

919
01:39:12.033 --> 01:39:14.501
You can start a family of your own.

920
01:39:15.604 --> 01:39:17.663
There are more deals to be made.

921
01:39:18.173 --> 01:39:22.701
More people willing to give their souls
for what they desire.

922
01:39:23.178 --> 01:39:26.944
Let someone else carry this curse.
You're free now.

923
01:39:28.417 --> 01:39:29.748
After all...

924
01:39:30.619 --> 01:39:32.450
...a deal's a deal.

925
01:39:45.534 --> 01:39:46.466
No.

926
01:39:48.437 --> 01:39:50.769
I'm gonna own this curse...

927
01:39:52.073 --> 01:39:54.564
...and I'm gonna use it against you.

928
01:39:55.544 --> 01:39:57.978
Whenever innocent blood is spilt...

929
01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.910
...it'll be my father's blood...

930
01:40:02.751 --> 01:40:04.844
...and you'll find me there.

931
01:40:05.554 --> 01:40:07.613
A spirit of vengeance...

932
01:40:08.557 --> 01:40:11.458
...fighting fire with fire.

933
01:40:12.894 --> 01:40:15.556
I will make you pay for this.

934
01:40:16.598 --> 01:40:18.532
You can't live in fear.

935
01:40:20.635 --> 01:40:22.660
No!

936
01:40:45.927 --> 01:40:48.191
So where will you go now?

937
01:40:49.664 --> 01:40:51.996
Wherever the road takes me, I guess.

938
01:40:56.037 --> 01:40:59.905
My daddy once said, "If you don't
make a choice, the choice makes you."

939
01:41:00.509 --> 01:41:04.570
Yeah. But why do your choices
always keep us apart?

940
01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.685
Sure wish things could have
turned out different.

941
01:41:22.297 --> 01:41:25.198
No. This is what you are.

942
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.068
This is what
you always were meant to be.

943
01:41:28.937 --> 01:41:30.268
You got your second chance.

944
01:41:31.139 --> 01:41:33.130
Go out there and make the best of it.

945
01:42:01.803 --> 01:42:05.204
<i>It's said that the West
was built on legends...</i>

946
01:42:06.675 --> 01:42:09.075
<i>... and that legends are
a way of understanding...</i>

947
01:42:09.311 --> 01:42:11.871
<i>... things greater than ourselves.</i>

948
01:42:12.247 --> 01:42:14.579
<i>Forces that shape our lives.</i>

949
01:42:14.816 --> 01:42:18.047
<i>Events that defy explanation.</i>

950
01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:22.883
<i>Individuals whose lives
soar to the heavens...</i>

951
01:42:23.158 --> 01:42:25.058
<i>... or fall to the earth.</i>

952
01:42:25.694 --> 01:42:28.993
<i>This is how legends are born.</i>
