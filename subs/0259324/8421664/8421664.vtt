Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

477

No one has ever attempted
such a distance before:

from field goal to field goal.

What's going through
your mind right now?

480

You look really good.
I've seen you on TV.

481
00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:25.146
You know, I watch a lot of TV
and you do a really good job.

to risk their life for entertainment?

802
00:59:19.347 --> 00:59:20.390
Piss off.

803
00:59:25.854 --> 00:59:28.315
The Rider is the
devil's bounty hunter.

804
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:33.570

808
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.251

813
01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.849
the Rider takes over.

814
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.060

There was some punk

819
01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:18.115
and I could see all the wrong
he'd ever done...

820
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.951
and I turned it all against him.

821
01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:23.453
The Penance Stare.

822
01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.415
It sears the souls
of the wicked.

823
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.461
It's the Ghost Rider's
greatest weapon.

824
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.588
All the Riders have it.

825
01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:40.637
Have there been others
with my "Ghost Rider" problem?

826
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:42.472
Been a few.

827
01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.308
Last one was 150 years ago...

828
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.187

called San Venganza.

829
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.523

832
01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:57.779
Till a stranger came along
making promises...

833
01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:00.323
one deal at a time.

834
01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:04.995
Consumed by greed,
they turned on one another

835
01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:09.958
until the village of San Venganza
drowned in its own blood...

836
01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:14.921
their souls trapped forever
in that godforsaken place.

837
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.507
What's this have to do
with Blackheart?

838
01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:21.219
Blackheart?

839
01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:25.390
He sent you after Blackheart?

840
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.517
And others.

841
01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:29.227
The Hidden.

842
01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:36.151
Fallen angels cast out of heaven
by Saint Michael himself.

843
01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:42.032
They hide within the elements
waiting for the end of days.

844
01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:47.662
You better hang

845

Thanks. And thanks for the info.

847

I didn't think sulfur was toxic.
It is, in massive doses.

And these guys
were swimming in it.

863
01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:04.990

He was tall, broad shoulders,

The devil,
on account of I work for him.

973
01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.875
That's why I couldn't
make it to dinner.

974
01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.087
Because you were
working for the devil?

975
01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.339
Well, yeah.
I'm his bounty hunter.

976
01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:04.051
But it only happens at night,
like it is right now.

977
01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:05.511
Whenever I'm around evil.

978
01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:06.721
Evil people.
Mm-hm.

979
01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.181
Evil spirits.
Okay.

980
01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:10.892
I change into...

981
01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:13.603
What?

982
01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:19.776
<font color=#FFFF00>(SIGHS)</font> Just a great big
monster, but I am learning to...

983
01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:22.195
I'm getting control of it.

984
01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.821
I'm trying to.

985
01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:28.242
So tonight, you'll...

<font color=#FFFF00>(IMITATES ROARING)</font>

987
01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:31.913
I believe so.

988
01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:35.583
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea that you...

989
01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.128
You run on home now, Roxanne.

990
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.634
You're serious.

991
01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:49.222
<font color=#FFFF00>(SIGHS)</font>

992
01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:52.642
So this is...
This is your excuse?

993
01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:57.063
For the past? For last night?
For everything?

994
01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.106
Uh-huh.

995
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.532
Um...

996
01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:10.701
The way I see it is
I've got a couple of choices:

997
01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:15.915
Um, I could either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true

998
01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.584
and take you to the
nearest psychiatric hospital.

999
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:19.794
You see, now that...

1000
01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:24.173
Or I realize that you'd rather
make up ridiculous stories

1001
01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.259
than be honest with me...

1002
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.595
and I walk out of that door...

1003
01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:31.013
forever.

Let's try this again.

1015
01:13:24.817 --> 01:13:28.362
We have your plate and the tread
from your tires at the crime scene.

1016
01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.823
We have a witness
who will testify

1017
01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.492
that the suspect
used some kind of fire effect.

1018
01:13:33.659 --> 01:13:36.746
An effect just like the ones
that you use in your stunt shows!

1019
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:41.167
Yeah. But I told you,
I didn't kill anybody.

What about him, you remember him?
No.

1022
01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.472
This guy was three years
from retirement,

1023
01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:56.015
never harmed a fly in his life.

1024
01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:58.601
In fact, neither did most
of the corpses turning up

1025
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.062
since you came home,
you son of a bitch.

1026
01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.523
I didn't kill anybody.
Bullshit!

1027
01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:06.317
Okay, let's take a breather.

1028
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:10.988
Whoo! It's warm in here.
Warm?

1029
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:12.990
Yeah, I'm burning up.
Aren't you?

1030
01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.408
A little.

1031
01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:18.496
You want a cigarette?

1032
01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.164
Okay.

1033
01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:22.500
Mind if I do?

1034
01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:29.215
Okay, that was weird.

1035
01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:35.680
Look, Johnny,
I'm not asking for your help.

1036
01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.933
I'm asking you to help yourself.

1037
01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:42.687
I watch a lot of TV
and I know what you're doing.

1038
01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:46.857
Good cop, bad cop.
But you're both good cops.

1039
01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:51.320
And, uh, you provide a very,
very important civil service.

1040
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.614
In fact, when I finish
my stunt career,

1041
01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:57.243
I intend to apply my skills
to being a motorcycle policeman.

1042
01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:00.955
So I'd love to help you.
But I didn't kill anybody.

1046

We're trying to help you here.

1047
01:15:09.255 --> 01:15:12.299
We're trying to keep
this thing quiet.

1048
01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:15.928
Yeah, because I imagine that
your fans wouldn't be too keen

1049
01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:19.515
on you being wrapped up
in a homicide investigation.

1050
01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:24.270
Not to mention all those corporate
sponsors, event promoters...

1051
01:15:27.481 --> 01:15:30.735
You ready to talk now, Johnny?

1052
01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.697
Or do you want to spend
the night in the tank?

1053
01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.074
Oh, I don't wanna do that.

1054
01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:40.911
No, sir.
I sure don't wanna do that.

1055
01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:46.125

he was a Texas Ranger.

What's he gotta do with this?

1224

Remember that contract
the stranger made

1225
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.330
with the people of San Venganza?

1226
01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:42.210
The story goes that Slade was sent
there to collect all the souls.

1227
01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:46.047
But what he found there
was so evil

1228
01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.634
that he took the contract
and rode off.

1229
01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:51.803
He stole it.

1230
01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:55.056
Keep Mephistopheles
from getting his hands on it.

1231
01:29:55.891 --> 01:29:58.643
Some people say
he was buried with it.

1232
01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:01.062
Was he?
I don't know.

1233
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:07.152
What I do know is that Blackheart is
coming, and he'll do anything to get it.

1234
01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:11.615
That's why it's important for you to

1247
01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.200
He got arrested, yeah?
What for?

1248
01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:59.329
Yeah, well, if this gets out in
the press, his career is over.

1249
01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.290
Yeah, trust me,
his career's the least of it.

1250

You know, you seem like a nice
lady, and you're pretty and all,

but we were riding the gravy train

and everything went to hell.

1253

So why don't you just go back
to wherever it is you came from?

1254

So if there's anything you know
that can help, anything...

1259
01:31:34.906 --> 01:31:37.575

with his mind, you know.

staying up late. And he does it over here.
