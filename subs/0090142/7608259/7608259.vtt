00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:24.624
[rhythmic beating]

2
00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.128
[rhythmic beating increasing]

3
00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.151
[exhaling deeply]

4
00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.419
[coach] Defense, defense!

5
00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:34.821
Ugh!

6
00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.589
[coach] Come on, ref, foul!

7
00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.693
Ugh!

8
00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:41.861
Good one!

9
00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.534
[sparse applause]

10
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.171
Time!

11
00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:53.573
Time, time!

12
00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:54.908
[whistle blowing]

13
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.545
All right!

14
00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.713
You guys suck.

15
00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.450
No, really?

16
00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:07.387
[man] Come on, let's go!

17
00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:10.089
[coach] Looking good.
Way to go.

18
00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.558
Nothing to worry about.
It's fine.

19
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.626
No problem.
Hot out there, isn't it?

20
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.428
Shouldn't have got
in his way, Scotty.

21
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.863
Hey, Scott-o,
looking good out there!

22
00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.898
Yeah,
how would you know, Stiles?

23
00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.367
You want to forfeit the game?

24
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.636
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

25
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.204
No?
No!

26
00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.540
My players have league
scoring records at stake.

27
00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:28.575
It wouldn't be fair to them.

28
00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:29.742
I just thought
if we quit now,

29
00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.277
you'd beat the 5:00 traffic.

30
00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.212
There's a lot to
learn from losing.

31
00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.515
OK, we'll play,
if it's that
big a deal to you.

32
00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.392
Hit me, I got it!
Over here, over here!

33
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.294
All right, set it up!
Push it up!

34
00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:51.965
It's not going
too well, is it?

35
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.334
What do you expect, Thorne?
Look at
the sneakers they're wearing.

36
00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:56.135
If our guys had
sneakers like that,

37
00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.937
there's no telling
what they could do.

38
00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.305
Shoot it!

39
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.809
We're all open!

40
00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.677
Jump it!

41
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.779
That fat kid's
got a great arm.

42
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:08.381
[whistle blowing]

43
00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.850
Over here, pass it!

44
00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.423
Forget it, dork!

45
00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:19.459
[growling]

46
00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:52.492
Nice try!

47
00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:54.861
Good game.

48
00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.796
Come on,
I wanna get out of here.

49
00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.865
[coach] Hey, come on,
it's not that bad!

50
00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.868
First game of the season,
11 more to go.

51
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.703
Hey, it's just a game!

52
00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:07.740
You bozos better
shape up out there.
I can't do this all by myself.

53
00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.342
What is that, liverwurst?

54
00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.977
What?

55
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.980
Thought you were supposed
to be on a diet, Chub.

56
00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.683
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57
00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:18.751
Chub, look at this.

58
00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.762
Give me that!
Stop snooping
around in my locker.

59
00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:31.831
Look, Chub, big guy,

60
00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:33.833
I could smell
that liverwurst
from over there.

61
00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.903
Oh, yeah, right.
Underneath these?

62
00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:39.372
Whoo! All right!

63
00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.574
Yeah, great game, guys!
We showed them.

64
00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:42.742
We lost, Stiles!

65
00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:43.910
Umpire needed glasses.

66
00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:45.678
Cheeseball.
Terrific, Brad.

67
00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.680
Hey, Scotto, you know
that $7 you owe me?

68
00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:49.015
You owe me.

69
00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:50.349
Listen,
Scott, this is important.

70
00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:51.718
If I don't find
a keg for tonight,

71
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.786
they won't let me
into that party.

72
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.021
Even if you come
up with the cash,
where're you gonna buy it?

73
00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.189
Later.
Lend me $5.

74
00:05:56.222 --> 00:05:57.790
Later.
$2.

75
00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.192
Hey, Chub, how's the diet?

76
00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:01.861
Hey,
Lemonade, give me five, man!

77
00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:05.131
You were terrific
out there, Lemonade!

78
00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.999
What the hell is that?

79
00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.136
Ah!

80
00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.607
Hey, hey, Lemonade, my man!
What it is?

81
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.442
Listen,
uh, I'm raising some cash

82
00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.277
for our school's
Afro-American festival

83
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.747
and I thought maybe...
Mick, can we talk?

84
00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.859
Hey, Scotty, come on in.

85
00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:36.062
Great game out there today.

86
00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.964
You want a thigh
or a wing or something?

87
00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.233
No,
that's not necessary, Coach.

88
00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:43.302
Listen, you know...
you know how you always said

89
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.104
that if any of us
guys had any problems,

90
00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:47.140
I mean, even personal ones,
that we should
come and see you?

91
00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.908
Hey, that's what I'm here for.

92
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.678
Great,
because, uh, I got a problem.

93
00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:56.749
Oh, yeah?
What kind of problem?

94
00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:58.951
As you can see,
I'm a very busy man here.

95
00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:01.687
Uh, yeah, well,
it's kind of complicated.

96
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.257
Oh. Oh,
those kind of problems, yeah.

97
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.926
What is it, drugs, girls?

98
00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.427
Boy,
I'd sure like to help you,

99
00:07:08.461 --> 00:07:09.929
but I'm really
tapped out this month.

100
00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.798
The IRS is
breathing down my neck

101
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:14.634
like it's some kind
of personal vendetta
against Bobby Finstock.

102
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.803
No, Coach...

103
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.337
How can I put this?

104
00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.108
I'm going through changes.

105
00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:25.978
Oh, that.
Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

106
00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:29.282
Some a little bit
later than others.
I'm sorry I didn't notice,

107
00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:32.051
but I haven't
been hanging around
the locker room all that much.

108
00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.986
No...

109
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.856
You see,
Coach, I just don't think
it's gonna be possible

110
00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.357
for me to play on
the team anymore.

111
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.293
Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:44.997
Well, look, uh, Scotty,
I know what
you're going through.

113
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.633
A couple years back,
a kid came to me
much the same way

114
00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:50.903
you're coming to me now,
saying to me pretty
much the same thing

115
00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:54.340
that you're saying.
He wanted to
drop off the team.

116
00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:56.242
His mother was, uh, a widow.

117
00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:58.211
All crippled up,
she was scrubbing floors.

118
00:07:58.244 --> 00:08:00.813
She had,
uh, had this pin in her hip.

119
00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.684
So he wanted to
drop basketball
and get a job.

120
00:08:04.717 --> 00:08:06.352
Now, these were poor people.
These were...

121
00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:09.088
These were hungry people
with real problems.

122
00:08:09.121 --> 00:08:11.357
You understand
what I'm saying?

123
00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:15.261
What happened to the kid?

124
00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:17.997
I don't know. He quit.

125
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.899
He was a 3rd-stringer,
I didn't need him.

126
00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.169
Yeah,
Coach, I'm a first-stringer.

127
00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:26.339
Yeah, and you already
got a job working
for your old man.

128
00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:28.174
The fact of
the matter is, I should

129
00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.876
be coming to you
when I need money.

130
00:08:31.744 --> 00:08:33.412
Fine, uh...

131
00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.747
Thanks a lot, Coach.

132
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.115
Hey, don't mention it.

133
00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:38.985
Like I said before,
mi casa su casa.

134
00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:42.054
Thanks.

135
00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:48.461
[girls talking and laughing]

136
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.732
Oh, hi, Boof.
Scott.

137
00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:54.033
Yeah.
Hi, you going to work?

138
00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.201
Can I walk with you?

139
00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.402
Catch you later,
Boof, at the party.

140
00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.905
Bye, Tina, Trina... Tina.

141
00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:02.208
I had the strangest
dream last night,
Boof. It was bizarre.

142
00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.709
Was I in this one?

143
00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:07.213
Yeah, yeah, you and...
and Pamela,
and a bunch of chickens.

144
00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.447
Boof, how the hell are you?

145
00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:09.882
No!
Say no.

146
00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:11.784
Chickens?
Great talking to you!

147
00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:15.054
Yeah, big chickens, giant.
Like fryers, you know?

148
00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:17.089
You know, that guy was right.
We do suck.

149
00:09:17.123 --> 00:09:19.225
No news there.

150
00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:23.062
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

151
00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:28.067
I'm sick of it, Boof.
I'm sick of being so average.

152
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.837
And it's not just basketball.
I-I-it's this school.

153
00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.906
It's this town.
It's everything.

154
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.142
I like Beacontown.

155
00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.277
I'd just like my
life to change.

156
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.812
You know,
I don't want to end up

157
00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.914
working for my dad
at the hardware store.

158
00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:44.050
Your father's a terrific guy.

159
00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.953
Boof, look at me.

160
00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:50.189
Now, try and be objective.

161
00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.590
Am I all right?

162
00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.392
I mean, is there anything
wrong with me?

163
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.263
You should probably shower
after basketball.

164
00:09:57.296 --> 00:09:58.497
I do.

165
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.466
Then no, there's
nothing wrong with you.

166
00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:05.104
Well, then,
uh, why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

167
00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:07.940
You can do a lot better
than Pamela Wells.

168
00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:09.508
Like who?

169
00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:11.110
Don't you have to be at work?

170
00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.179
Hey. Hey,
did I say something wrong?

171
00:10:13.212 --> 00:10:15.147
No, no.
See you at the party, OK?

172
00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.621
Hey, Angela.

173
00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.522
Hi, Scotty, how're you doing?
What was the score?

174
00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:24.991
Very funny.

175
00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:27.293
[Dad] Fifty.
What was the score?

176
00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:28.461
71...

177
00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.129
Don't tell me.
I'll lose my count.

178
00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.298
We're down to our
last waffle iron.

179
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.133
You know these wrenches
are made in India?

180
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.469
How do they
expect me to compete
with the big boys?

181
00:10:36.502 --> 00:10:38.204
"I'm not Sears and Roebuck."
I'm not Sears and Roebuck.

182
00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:41.340
Well, I'm not.
You look a little
tired today, Scott.

183
00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.210
That coach is
not giving you boys
steroids or anything, is he?

184
00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:49.081
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

185
00:10:49.115 --> 00:10:51.317
You know,
Beacontown hasn't won a

186
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.519
ball game in,
it must be three years.

187
00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:55.221
Ow!
[sharp whistle blowing]

188
00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:58.090
Don't take it personally,
Scott.

189
00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:00.493
It's all part of growing up.

190
00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:02.595
Yeah, uh, yeah, I guess so.

191
00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:04.997
Uh, any deliveries?

192
00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:06.432
[whistle blowing]

193
00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.100
Ah!

194
00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:10.102
[Dad] Some strange-sounding
guy called.

195
00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.604
Sounded like he
was in a big hurry.

196
00:11:11.637 --> 00:11:13.172
Ah! Today?

197
00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.741
I'm not sure
what I wrote down,
but check the clipboard.

198
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:16.942
"Check the clipboard."

199
00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:18.077
That's what it's there for.

200
00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:19.945
Well, it is.

201
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.451
[whistle blowing]

202
00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.063
It's broken.

203
00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.003
Dog whistle?

204
00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:17.236
Hi, Mr.
Thorne. How are you, sir?

205
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.370
Whoa!

206
00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.474
Thanks.

207
00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:27.613
Whoa, what an arm.

208
00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:29.982
Thanks, Mr. Thorne.

209
00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:31.517
Appreciate it.

210
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.619
Go to hell.

211
00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.088
"I knew he was out there.

212
00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:38.190
I didn't actually hear him,

213
00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.259
but I knew he was there.

214
00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:43.596
I could only see
a thin, white crack of light,

215
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.598
which set my bedroom apart..."

216
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:48.934
[man] More sensual, darling!
We need to feel you!
Want to smell you!

217
00:12:48.968 --> 00:12:50.136
Hurt me, hurt me!

218
00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:52.304
"...from the dense
and heavy darkness.

219
00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:56.108
But surely, I could feel him.
It was Nick."

220
00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:57.143
[crashing sound]

221
00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.946
What was that?

222
00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.115
Sor...
Sorry, sir. That was me.

223
00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:05.684
What do you want from me, hmm?

224
00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.954
What do people want from me?

225
00:13:08.988 --> 00:13:11.056
I am merely trying
to rehearse, hmm?

226
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.193
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:17.163
I've got the stuff
that you ordered.

228
00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:19.165
Wait, are you from
the hardware store?

229
00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:21.300
Uh, yeah.

230
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.035
Ah.
Uh...

231
00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:27.706
Uh, Pamela, excuse me, um...

232
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.341
Are you going to
the party tonight?

233
00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:32.645
Because, uh, if you are,
I'd like to give you a ride.

234
00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:38.150
The paint...
My paint. A can of cocoa,
a can of mauve, am I right?

235
00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.351
Uh, right.

236
00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:42.154
Kirk, how was my reading?

237
00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:45.324
Uh, uh, beautiful, darling.
Very sensual.

238
00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:46.825
I'm still in pain. Thank you.

239
00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:48.360
Uh, you're welcome.

240
00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.430
Listen, about tonight,
I mean, I'm serious.

241
00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:56.235
I'd like to take you.
Uh, I... I've got a van.

242
00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:59.438
Hope your acting's better
than your hook shot, boy.

243
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:01.073
I already have a ride.

244
00:14:01.106 --> 00:14:04.710
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

245
00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:06.679
He just delivers hardware,
Mick.

246
00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:10.349
Well, maybe he should get back
to delivering it. Come on.

247
00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:11.584
Ooh!
[laughing]

248
00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.421
[laughing]

249
00:14:24.096 --> 00:14:28.133
[Lolley] I said,
"mauve," not turquoise!

250
00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.469
Uh, Mr... Mr. Lolley...

251
00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:39.612
The boss says
I'm to pick up a keg of beer.

252
00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:41.046
That right?

253
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.414
Well,
the boss called you, right?

254
00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:43.782
Can't say he did.

255
00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:45.451
Oh, hot damn!

256
00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:47.386
The boss is
throwing a big bash
for one of the boys

257
00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.255
down at the gravel pit.

258
00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:52.458
[chuckling] He
just got paroled.

259
00:14:52.491 --> 00:14:54.460
[chuckling]

260
00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.730
Hmm.

261
00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:01.267
Well,
I got, uh, plenty of bread.

262
00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:03.502
[chuckling]

263
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.673
Here. Here's
a little extra for you.

264
00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:13.812
Got to see your ID...

265
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.848
...sport.

266
00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:37.936
I don't even like beer.

267
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.338
Never...

268
00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:41.507
...say... die.

269
00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:47.846
[clears throat]

270
00:15:49.148 --> 00:15:50.149
Dad?

271
00:15:51.183 --> 00:15:52.651
Uh...

272
00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.219
What'd you say if I
said I was thinking

273
00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:55.688
of quitting
the basketball team?

274
00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:57.656
Quitting the team?

275
00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.857
Yeah.

276
00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.626
That's pretty drastic,
isn't it?

277
00:16:00.659 --> 00:16:02.561
I mean,
you're not the worst player
they've got.

278
00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:05.397
You know,
your mother always said you
could do anything you want to.

279
00:16:05.431 --> 00:16:06.699
Yeah, I know.

280
00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:10.302
I was just thinking
of doing something else.

281
00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.503
Like what?

282
00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.806
School play.

283
00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:16.508
Well, theater has
its place, I suppose,

284
00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:20.245
but what about your commitment
to the team, to the school?

285
00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:24.316
Dad... has anything ever
happened to you

286
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.884
that was so weird...

287
00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:29.154
Maybe it's time you
and I had a chat.

288
00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.357
Hey, Mr.
Howard, how's the king
of the nuts and bolts?

289
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.591
Stiles, nice shirt.

290
00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.892
Hey, thanks.

291
00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.361
Come on, we're late.

292
00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:37.663
Boof going with you?

293
00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.332
Uh, yeah, I don't
know how she's getting there.

294
00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:41.667
Uh, is this ok?

295
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.235
No, don't worry
about it, I'll get it.

296
00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:45.704
Go ahead, have a good time.
Be careful.

297
00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:51.176
Come on!

298
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.746
Hey, hey, listen, Stiles.

299
00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.181
Do you know anything about
a rash that's going around?

300
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.516
Why, you looking
to catch something?

301
00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.685
No, I'm serious.

302
00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:03.756
No, but I heard Mr. Murphy,
you know, the shop teacher?

303
00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.023
Yeah?

304
00:17:05.057 --> 00:17:07.259
Got his dick caught
in a vacuum cleaner.

305
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.628
[chuckling]

306
00:17:09.661 --> 00:17:11.397
Forget I asked.

307
00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:21.640
[Scott] Stiles, you're crazy.

308
00:17:21.673 --> 00:17:24.443
No, it's not crazy.
It's perfect.

309
00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:27.646
Now, you just stick this
in your pocket, like this.

310
00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.948
All right, you go in there,
you don't say anything except,

311
00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:32.718
"Give me a keg, buddy."
And you pay for it,

312
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.720
that way,
he can't say you robbed him.

313
00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:36.588
You know I'd do
this myself, but that

314
00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.424
old guy in there
already kicked me out.

315
00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.961
Give me the gun.

316
00:17:42.995 --> 00:17:44.696
Give me the money.

317
00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.499
Oh!

318
00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.734
I'm gonna try and buy it.

319
00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.402
No, no, no, Scott!
That's it!

320
00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.805
This guy is a ball-buster,
and it won't work.

321
00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:53.906
That's it!

322
00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:54.973
It won't work!

323
00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:57.876
Shit!

324
00:18:03.715 --> 00:18:05.451
Never say...

325
00:18:07.553 --> 00:18:09.354
...die.

326
00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:11.356
[woman] No, no, no, not that.

327
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.959
Yeah, no,
no, I think I'll leave it.

328
00:18:13.992 --> 00:18:17.496
No, no, no.
Thanks a lot, anyways.
Bye.

329
00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:19.765
Do you have any more
of that brown liqueur?

330
00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:21.733
My sister really liked that.

331
00:18:24.002 --> 00:18:26.638
Yes, thank you.

332
00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.708
Yes.
Yvette, are you coming?

333
00:18:31.643 --> 00:18:33.645
[heartbeat pounding]

334
00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:35.581
Hi.

335
00:18:37.483 --> 00:18:38.484
Hi.

336
00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.754
Uh, I'd like
a keg of beer, please.

337
00:18:43.922 --> 00:18:46.291
You don't say?

338
00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.861
Yeah, uh, how much is that?

339
00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:51.964
Do you have any ID, sonny?

340
00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:54.800
You little bastards
just won't give up, will you?

341
00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.302
Listen,
no ID, no goddamn beer.

342
00:18:57.336 --> 00:19:00.038
Can't you get that through
your thick skull?

343
00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:09.047
[deep voice] Give
me a keg of beer.

344
00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.359
[normal voice] And these.

345
00:19:21.026 --> 00:19:23.362
♪ Findin' my way

346
00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:26.665
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh 

347
00:19:26.698 --> 00:19:28.467
Yeah! Ha-ha!

348
00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.008
What'd you say to
that guy in the store?

349
00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.944
Just, uh, "Give me a keg."

350
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:41.013

because he did time.

I'll say.

527
00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.294
You may be surprised.

528
00:31:36.327 --> 00:31:39.564
Whatever it is, son,
you can tell me.
I'll understand.

529
00:31:39.597 --> 00:31:43.234
Ahhh. Ah! No, Dad.

530
00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:45.470
Ah, no. Not this time.

531
00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.640
Scott Howard,
this is your father speaking!

532
00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.576
Now, open this door,
right this minute!

533
00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:52.810
OK, Dad.

534
00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:56.781
You asked for it.

535
00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:19.103
An explanation
is probably long overdue.

536
00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.439
An explanation?

537
00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:24.375
Jesus Christ, Dad!
An explanation?

538
00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.678
Look at me. Look at you.

539
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:28.313
It's not as bad as it looks.

540
00:32:28.346 --> 00:32:30.515
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, Dad!

541
00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.550
You mean, you knew about this?

542
00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:35.353
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

543
00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:37.388
I was hoping I
wouldn't have to.

544
00:32:37.422 --> 00:32:40.692
Sometimes it
skips a generation.

545
00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:42.560
I was hoping it
would pass you by.

546
00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:45.363
Well,
Dad, it didn't pass me by.

547
00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:48.399
It landed on my face!

548
00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.535
What the hell am I gonna do?

549
00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:59.310
Scott, we really need
to talk about this!

550
00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:02.380
Forget it, Dad!
I don't want to talk! Go away!

551
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.626
[wolf howls]

552
00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:36.347
Tough night, huh?

553
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:39.183
Yeah, you could say that.

554
00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:42.687
On top of everything else,
there was a full
moon last night.

555
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.189
Well, I, uh, meant
to talk to you
about that last evening,

556
00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:48.493
but you were kind of upset.

557
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:53.297
Here's a nice
hot cup of cocoa.

558
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.466
Looks like you can use it.

559
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.901
That'll help.

560
00:33:58.336 --> 00:34:02.373
Look, Scott, being what we are

561
00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:05.476
is not without its problems,
but it's not all bad, either.

562
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.744
Tell me about it.

563
00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:08.246
Well, for one thing,

564
00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:09.881
you'll be able to do things
other guys aren't.

565
00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:14.318
Oh, like, uh, chase cars
and bite the mailman?

566
00:34:14.352 --> 00:34:18.389
When you want it,
you're gonna have great power.

567
00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:21.759
And with great power goes
a greater responsibility.

568
00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.060
Your mother and
I learned to live

569
00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:24.328
with this thing,
and so can you.

570
00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.497
And what if I can't?

571
00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.599
I... I can look
forward to a life of,

572
00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:30.802
uh, stealing babies in
the middle of the night

573
00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:33.504
and, uh, killing chickens.

574
00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:35.773
Fearing full moons,
dodging silver bullets.

575
00:34:35.807 --> 00:34:37.742
Well, thank you,
Dad, but no thanks!

576
00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:40.244
Don't believe all that stuff
you see in the movies.

577
00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:43.414
With certain
obvious exceptions,

578
00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.850
werewolves are people
just like anyone else.

579
00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:50.421
What I'm trying to say is,

580
00:34:50.455 --> 00:34:52.757
the werewolf is a part of you,

581
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.592
but that doesn't change
what you have inside.

582
00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:57.261
Look, Dad,
I got a bad outside hook shot,

583
00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.964
I'm allergic to eggs,
I've got a $6 haircut,

584
00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:02.533
I mean, I have problems!

585
00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.402
I don't need this one!

586
00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.473
I've got to get to school.

587
00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:14.979
That went well.

588
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.365
Hi.
Hello.

589
00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.837
There's something
different about you.

590
00:35:40.671 --> 00:35:42.306
That's nice.

591
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.875
Did you change your hair?

592
00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:49.313
Missed you at
lunch today, Scott.

593
00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:53.317
Uh, yeah. Hi, Boof.
Uh, sorry, I forgot. I forgot.

594
00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:56.020
Well,
I have to go study my lines.

595
00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:58.689
Kirk... Mr.
Lolley, he's so demanding.

596
00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:01.826
Bye.

597
00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.894
Bye.

598
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.868
[bell rings]

599
00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.373
How's it going, Stiles?

600
00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:20.044
The twins were abandoned
and surely would've died,

601
00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:22.947
in
the wilderness if they hadn't
been saved by a... by a what?

602
00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.117
A miracle?

603
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.721
Yes, I suppose, but what form
did this
particular miracle take?

604
00:36:30.755 --> 00:36:32.423
Scott Howard?

605
00:36:37.962 --> 00:36:39.797
[clears throat]

606
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.732
[howls mildly]

607
00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:46.537
Very amusing, Scott,
but you are correct.

608
00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:50.374
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf,

609
00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:51.976
a she-wolf.

610
00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:54.412
[voice echoes] Wolf... wolf...

611
00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:55.479
Wolfe!

612
00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:56.614
Ah!

613
00:36:57.448 --> 00:36:58.883
Choo.

614
00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:02.386
Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people
ever read what I assign you?

615
00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.121
Look Homeward, Angel.

616
00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:08.492
Scott,
it's a book by Thomas Wolfe.

617
00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.963
[voice echoes] Wolf... wolf...

618
00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.164
[woman] Scott.

619
00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:17.401
Come on, Scott.

620
00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:19.537
It's a lot
simpler than it looks.

621
00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.442
OK.

622
00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.158
Just try, Scott.

623
00:37:41.192 --> 00:37:42.860
[heartbeat pounding]

624
00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:53.170
[students laughing]

625
00:37:59.176 --> 00:38:00.811
[heart pounding faster]

626
00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:14.525
It's wet. You can't go in.

627
00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.194
That's wet, too!

628
00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:50.928
Don't change. Don't change.

629
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:54.865
Stay calm.
Stay calm. Stay calm.

630
00:39:01.872 --> 00:39:03.908
A little far from your side
of the building, aren't you?

631
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:08.045
No! I mean, yeah. Yes, sir.
But the halls were wet.

632
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.448
Let me see your hands.

633
00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:11.682
Sir?

634
00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:14.251
Let me see your hands, now.

635
00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:26.263
You wouldn't happen to have
a marker on you, would you?

636
00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:34.038
No. Uh, no. N-no, sir.

637
00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.274
I've got my eyes on you.
And if you ever
get out of line...

638
00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:39.777
[bell rings]

639
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.912
Yeah, uh, I've got to go.

640
00:40:02.032 --> 00:40:04.068
Hey, what are you doing?

641
00:40:04.101 --> 00:40:06.937
Hey, big brother
always keeps a stash
out here for emergencies.

642
00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:10.274
Listen. Listen, Stiles.

643
00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:12.743
Uh, I... I've got to
talk about something,

644
00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.111
because it's making me nuts.

645
00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.579
I hear you,
but if it's that intense,

646
00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:18.149
I'll need a solid
buzz to think clearly.

647
00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:22.086
Well, look, I... I...
I wouldn't even, uh,

648
00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:24.255
I wouldn't mention it to you,

649
00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:26.157
except that I've got
to talk to someone.

650
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.092
Wait, are you gonna
tell me you're a fag?

651
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.994
I mean, if you're
gonna tell me you're

652
00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:31.929
a fag, I don't
think I can handle it.

653
00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:35.299
No, I'm not a fag.

654
00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:37.701
I'm a... werewolf.

655
00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.273
Where would that
scumbag keep it?

656
00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:46.177
[growling]

657
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.912
[growling]

658
00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:54.318
Scott?

659
00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.623
Scotty?

660
00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:01.025
Stiles, it's me.

661
00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.270
What do you...
what do you think?

662
00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:18.809
Can you do that
anytime you want?

663
00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:23.814
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
I mean, I just did.

664
00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:27.184
But, you see, sometimes it...
it happens when I
don't want it to.

665
00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:31.188
What can I say?

666
00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:36.093
You're beautiful.

667
00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:38.162
[snorts]

668
00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.230
Nah.

669
00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:46.003
Hey,
uh, what can a teen wolf do?

670
00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:48.272
I can smell what
you're looking for.

671
00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:50.274
The stash?

672
00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:56.146
Well, now, I checked there.

673
00:42:05.956 --> 00:42:08.359
Stiles, Stiles...

674
00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.394
This is just
between you and me, OK?

675
00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:12.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah, T.W.

676
00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:16.367
[chuckling]

677
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.035
Look at you!

678
00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:20.271
T.W., you're gonna be glad
that you came to me with this.

679
00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.273
Yes, because with
the right angles,

680
00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.709
man, we're gonna turn
this into something...

681
00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:27.044
...monstrous.

682
00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.312
Stiles...

683
00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.080
Stiles.

684
00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.750
Come on, come on!

685
00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:34.752
Shoot it! Shoot it!

686
00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.921
No way! No way! No way!

687
00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:40.057
Don't foul me!
Don't foul me, now!
Here we go! Here we go!

688
00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.091
[Dad laughing]

689
00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.728
Yeah!

690
00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.297
[Dad laughing]

691
00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:49.934
Hi, Scott.

692
00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:51.568
Hi.

693
00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:55.239
Boof came over for
a little one-on-one,
and she's killing me.

694
00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.573
[laughing]

695
00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:57.908
What?

696
00:42:57.942 --> 00:42:59.777
What's so funny?

697
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.913
Nothing.
We were just chatting.
Do you mind?

698
00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:06.250
No, no.
Hey, why should I mind?

699
00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:11.088
Well, I've got to get going.
Would you like
to walk me home?

700
00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:13.424
Uh, Boof, I just got here.

701
00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.792

711
00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:44.822
[Scott] So,
you guys were chatting.

712
00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:47.257
Harold Howard and
his famous chats.

713
00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:49.493
Uh, what did he say?

714
00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:51.695
Oh, he just
mentioned that you were

715
00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.964
thinking of
quitting basketball

716
00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.532
to work on the school play.

717
00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.167
Yeah.

718
00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:59.136
I can see why.

719
00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:03.407
She's very pretty, Scott,
but she has a boyfriend.

720
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.144
A very large boyfriend.

721
00:44:07.177 --> 00:44:08.379
Look,
it doesn't matter, anyway,

722
00:44:08.412 --> 00:44:10.014
'cause the way
things are going now,

723
00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.982
it'd be better
if I just stayed
away from everyone.

724
00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.250

725
00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:18.188

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:24.862
We were five.

729
00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:26.497
I wanted to run
away from home,

730
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.265
but you wouldn't
let me go alone.

731
00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.400
I was afraid you'd get lost!

732
00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.268
Yeah, but I didn't get lost.

733
00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.903
We just kept
walking around the block,
because our...

734
00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:35.172
[together] ...parents wouldn't
let us cross the street.

735
00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:37.274
God, I thought they were gonna
kill us when we got home.

736
00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:40.344
I know, but then when we did,
nobody knew we were gone.

737
00:44:40.377 --> 00:44:42.179
Nope.
Did you ever tell anybody?

738
00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.447

Pamela, what about basketball?

It's a small part,
just for you.

Well, uh, sometimes I...

to steal chickens
out of the backyard

Does that guy, Mick,
always act like that?

952

You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

959
00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:24.260
Yeah?

960
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:27.897
Yeah.

961
00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.233
Well,
you see, the spring dance
is coming up, and I...

962
00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:32.402
And I already told you,

963
00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.370
I'm going to
the dance with Mick.

966
01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.349
[Scott] Hey, Chubaroo,
nice game, guy.

967
01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.917
Yeah.

968
01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:24.153
At least we're winning.

969

You mean, he's winning.

971

What good is being
in the championship

972

if none of us get to play?

973
01:00:30.493 --> 01:00:32.362
It doesn't matter how you
play the game,

974
01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:33.963
it's whether you win or lose.

975
01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:36.165
And even that doesn't make all
that much difference.

976

a celebration, huh?

Brad, glass of milk?

980
01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.379
I don't get it, Coach.
What's their problem?

981
01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.381
Let me give you
a little advice.

982
01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.249
There's three
rules that I live by:

983
01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:55.385
never get less
than 12 hours sleep,

984
01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:58.421
never play cards with a guy
who's got the same
first name as a city,

985
01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.323
and never go near
a lady who's got

986
01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.325
a tattoo of
a dagger on her body.

987
01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:06.262
Now, you stick with that,
everything else
is cream cheese.

988
01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:08.031
Great game, there, Scotty.

you pay for this?
