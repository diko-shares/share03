00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800
(¢Ü " Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses
Theme" by Arnie Roth)

2
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.400
And so, as chief emissary
of the majestic kingdom of Bulovia,

3
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.600
which is known for its abundance
of pears, potatoes and peasants,

4
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.500
I am authorised by my courageous king
and my magnificent queen

5
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.200
to hereby invite the princesses
of King Randolph to a royal gala.

6
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.800
We have invited princesses from
far and wide to this extraordinary ball.

7
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.700
- Papa, look what I found.
- You won't believe it.

8
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.600
Janessa, Kathleen, wait for me.

9
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.500
- As I was saying...
- A blue-winged beetle.

10
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.800
- It makes a strange noise when it...
- (buzzes)

11
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.700
- See?
- Whoa.

12
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.100
- Oh, my.
- Your Majesty, as I was say...

13
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
Oh! Ugh!

14
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300
Don't hurt him.

15
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.000
Quick, catch him
before he gets to the pantry.

16
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.400
Slow down, you guys.

17
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.700
Playing through.
Just be a second, Papa.

18
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.100
Your Highness,
I really think perhaps this is not...

19
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.100
Whoa. Delia!

20
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.900
Sorry.
Too much wrist.

21
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.400
- Those are your daughters?
- A few of them.

22
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.600
- Rambunctious, aren't they?
- (girl) Look, Papa.

23
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.800
(laughs)

24
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.000
Humph!

25
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.100
Your daughters
are hardly proper princesses.

26
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.900
- I can't wait for him to meet Harold.
- Whoaaa!

27
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.000
- (crash)
- Oh!

28
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.100
- (princesses laugh)
- Humph.

29
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Perhaps another ball.
Your Highness.

30
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.400
Princesses? Huh!
More like wild animals.

31
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.800
- (Delia) My turn.
- (beetle buzzes)

32
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.500
Hello, Papa.

33
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.100
- Ashlyn.
- How are you, Papa?

34
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.600
(Randolph) Blair.

35
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.800
Courtney.

36
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.400
- Papa.
- We're here, Papa.

37
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.300
- (Randolph) Fallon.
- Hello.

38
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400
- Ooh, what's for lunch?
- (Randolph) Edeline, Delia.

39
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.000
We're absolutely, positively starving.

40
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.400
Hello, Hadley, Isla.

41
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.000
Hello, Janessa, Kathleen.

42
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.000
And Lacey.

43
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.400
There you are, dear.

44
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.800
- Where is Genevieve?
- (meows)

45
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.100
(Randolph) Twyla, off the table please.

46
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.900
Sorry I'm late, Papa.

47
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.100
- My 12 princesses.
- (princesses all speak at once)

48
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
(noisy gabbling)

49
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.800
(clears throat)

50
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.800
Quiet, please.

51
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.600
Girls?

52
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.200
Please!

53
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.300
- Quiet down.
- (princesses) Shh!

54
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.000
(Randolph clears his throat)

55
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.300
It's been pointed out to me
that you could be doing more to be, um...

56
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.600
well, proper princesses.

57
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600
Like what, Papa?

58
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.700
Well, uh, like, um...

59
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.500
Well, I...

60
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.900
Perhaps, uh... um...

61
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.200
The royal cobbler has arrived.

62
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.900
- He's...
- Here!

63
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.700
- Bye, Papa.
- Goodbye.

64
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.500
Wait. Girls!

65
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.100
- They're just shoes.
- (princesses gasp)

66
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.100
Just shoes?!

67
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.400
Aren't they?

68
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.300
They're dancing shoes, Papa.

69
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.700
(sighs)

70
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.200
Bon appetit, Twyla.

71
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.300
(triplets giggle excitedly)

72
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.500
- (Janessa) Derek, Derek, Derek!
- (Kathleen) Do you have our shoes?

73
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.200
- Can we see?
- Was I supposed to bring shoes?

74
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.100
Yes!

75
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.100
Maybe you can help me.

76
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400
(princesses gasp)

77
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.500
Oh, Derek, they're lovely.

78
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.200
You're amazing, Derek.

79
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.400
I'm glad you like them,
Your Highnesses.

80
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.000
(sighs)

81
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.600
(caws)

82
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.200
I taught him everything he knows.

83
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.200
Yeah, right, Felix.

84
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.300
- Anything for me?
- Are you kidding?

85
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.500
He burned the midnight oil for you.

86
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.700
That'll do, Felix.

87
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.000
He's just a bird.
He doesn't know what he's saying.

88
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.500
Oh. Of course.

89
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.200
- Can you please...
- Tighten our shoes?

90
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.800
These are yours.

91
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.000
I hope you like them,
Your Highness.

92
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.600
Oh!

93
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.500
Thank you.

94
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.600
- Thank you, Derek.
- Thanks, Derek.

95
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.400
You blew your chance, Romeo.

96
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.200
What chance?
She's a princess.

97
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.300
All we're missing is music.

98
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.200
Music?

99
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.100
Hey. Hey!

100
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.500
- You play?
- I...

101
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.200
I don't. Not really.

102
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.300
- Will you play for us?
- Please, Derek, please?

103
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.600
As you wish, Your Highnesses.

104
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.900
(¢Ü "Derek's Tune")

105
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.200
(sighs)

106
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.700
I love them,
but at times I don't understand them.

107
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.300
If only you were here.

108
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.000
You know what we should do?
Let's make a new pair of stilts.

109
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.000
- And extra tall this time.
- (lsla) That's such a good idea.

110
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.900
Why use a closet
when the floor is closer?

111
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.900
Exactly.

112
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.600
Genevieve, is it the shoes you like?

113
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.300
- Or the cobbler who made them?
- (all giggle)

114
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.600
- What are you talking about?
- Derek is so cute.

115
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.700
If you say so, Fallon.

116
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.800
Maybe the problem is
he's not a prince.

117
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.900
I don't care if he's a prince,
a king or an emperor. The truth is...

118
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.200
You are head over heels.

119
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.700
Don't be ridiculous.
Besides, he never notices me.

120
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.600
If I were paying attention,
which I'm not.

121
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.500
- Genevieve's got it bad.
- (giggling)

122
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.000
Good night, Thomas.

123
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.700
Richard.

124
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.000
(gasps)

125
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.100
- Where's Harold?
- What is he? A spider?

126
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.200
- A scorpion?
- (Fallon) A snake?

127
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.100
(all gasp and scream)

128
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.000
No.

129
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.200
A caterpillar.

130
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.400
(sighs of relief)

131
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.200
My lady.

132
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.100
Oh!

133
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.400
Thank you, Desmond.

134
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.100
Desmond, my things.

135
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.000
Oh.

136
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.500
Whoa.

137
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.200
Huh?

138
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.000
(laughs)

139
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000
And the carriage, my lady?

140
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.300
Oh, we won't be needing it again.

141
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.700
Welcome, Duchess Rowena.
The king is expecting you.

142
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.000
Yes, he is.

143
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.400
- Heavens!
- The king doesn't have his own monkey?

144
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.400
Uh, no, Your Grace.

145
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.000
Well, they're quite popular this year.

146
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.000
- Come, Brutus.
- (laughs)

147
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.800
(Desmond groans)

148
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.300
Rowena, good of you to come
on such short notice.

149
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.600
Happy to be of service, dear cousin.

150
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.900
I'm looking forward to my time here.

151
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.200
Come, meet my daughters.
They're waiting for you.

152
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.500
Ashlyn, the eldest.

153
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.800
- Welcome, Your Grace.
- Glad to be here, my dear.

154
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.300
Blair, the second eldest.

155
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.800
Is that mud on your skirt?

156
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.700
I was out riding.

157
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.600
Courtney.

158
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.700
Oh. Hello.

159
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.900
Yes. Hello.

160
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.900
Delia and Edeline.

161
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.800
- Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Ladyship.

162
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.100
And to you.

163
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.700
- Fallon.
- Your Grace.

164
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.100
Can I hold him?

165
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.600
No, don't touch him.

166
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.000
He's quite rare.

167
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.900
And, um... well, um...

168
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.400
The twins, Hadley and Isla.

169
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.000
- Welcome.
- Your Grace.

170
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.200
The pleasure is mine.

171
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:51.100
(Randolph) And the triplets,
Janessa, Kathleen and Lacey.

172
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.500
- Hi, Your Grace.
- Hello, Your Grace.

173
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.300
- I picked this for you.
- Would that be paint?

174
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.500
In your hair?

175
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.400
And we're just missing Genevieve.

176
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.400
Right here.

177
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.700
Sorry, Papa.

178
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.100
(blows raspberry and laughs)

179
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.000
It's nice to see you, Your Grace.

180
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.700
Thank you, Genevieve.
Tell me, are you often late?

181
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.800
I guess.

182
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.700
Well, uh...

183
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:34.700
Yes. But I'm working on it.

184
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.900
Well, you called me
not a moment too soon.

185
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.700
Your girls are
dreadfully unprepared for royal life.

186
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.500
I've asked Duchess Rowena
to take charge of your upbringing.

187
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.800
- But, Papa, we...
- No protests, please.

188
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:55.600
One day, you'll be responsible
for running the kingdom.

189
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.400
You need to be proper princesses.

190
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.800
Duchess Rowena will prepare you.

191
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.000
And it looks like
I have my work cut out for me.

192
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.700
(sniffs)

193
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:24.800
Boo!

194
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.800
Oh. A little scaredy-cat.

195
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:32.300
Are you kidding?
I come from a long line of ferocious tigers

196
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.700
from the deepest jungles of India.

197
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.600
(roars)

198
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.400
Yeah, right.
You're about as ferocious as a flea.

199
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.100
Like this one.

200
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.400
- There's another. And another.
- Ouch! Hey!

201
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.600
(laughs)

202
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.100
Line up.

203
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:02.200
Things are going to be a bit different
around here now, starting with your attire.

204
00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.000
Fans up.

205
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.900
- Blair, look alive.
- I'm Fallon.

206
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.800
Whatever.
Now flutter them like this.

207
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.100
Coy, feminine.

208
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200
Lacey, you're creating a tornado.

209
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.500
- I'm Courtney.
- And I'm getting impatient.

210
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.400
Try again.
Just above your noses.

211
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.000
Good.

212
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.900
Well, that's a start.

213
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.300
(princesses chatter)

214
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.100
Oh, look.

215
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.900
Charming.

216
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000
Desmond, remove this mess.

217
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.400
- I can't believe this.
- Where did all my books go?

218
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.400
It's not fair. My things
were fine right where they were.

219
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.200
- These bedspreads are awful.
- I miss all the colours.

220
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.900
(clock chimes)

221
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.500
It's eight o'clock.
Hurry.

222
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.100
Go, go, go!

223
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.300
Here you go, Lacey.

224
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.900
Genevieve.
Late again? Hm.

225
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.400
You know bedtime
is now eight o'clock.

226
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.900
- Sorry, Your Grace.
- Yes.

227
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.400
Tardiness is a terribly
unprincesslike habit, don't you think?

228
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.800
I'll see everyone tomorrow,
bright and early. Happy dreams, girls.

229
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.300
(Brutus laughs)

230
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.700
She's so mean.

231
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.800
If Papa knew what Rowena
was really like, he'd change his mind.

232
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.300
I don't know.
He did ask her to be in charge.

233
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Talk to him, Genevieve.
He'll listen to you.

234
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.000
Now, where did we leave off?
Bishop to queen three.

235
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:43.100
Hm. You're making me pay
for beating you last time.

236
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.400
Exactly.

237
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.500
You'll have to wait a little longer.
Rook takes bishop.

238
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.400
Oh! How did I miss that?

239
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.500
- Papa, I was wondering...
- If I'll go easy on you?

240
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.200
No. Knight to king four.

241
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.800
It's about Cousin Rowena.

242
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.400
- Charming, isn't she?
- Very, uh... stylish.

243
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.100
But she's changing everything.
She wants us to do everything her way.

244
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.600
- As I've asked her to.
- But we were fine before.

245
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.800
Oh, that's not what I've heard,
Genevieve.

246
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.200
But perhaps you're right.

247
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.100
There's so much work to be done,
maybe I'm not the right one for the task.

248
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.900
What you really need
is an entire team, you see.

249
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.800
Tutors for protocol, diction,
language, etiquette, style.

250
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:40.600
It's exhausting just to think about.
I should go. Yes, I should.

251
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.200
No, Rowena, you mustn't.

252
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.600
My girls need you. I can't embarrass them
in front of the kingdom

253
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.600
by bringing in groups of tutors.
There's enough talk already.

254
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.300
Well, if you really think
I can be of service.

255
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.800
It's settled, then?

256
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.300
But, Papa...

257
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.200
You must listen to the duchess.
She knows what's best for you.

258
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.800
I don't want to hear
any more on the subject.

259
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.100
Yes, Papa.

260
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.300
(whines)

261
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.300
I hate to see her upset.

262
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.100
Girls are so emotional.

263
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.900
What they need is proper guidance.

264
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.400
Here, dear cousin, try this tea.

265
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.600
Smooth and refreshing.

266
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.700
To your health.

267
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.900
He won't listen.
He thinks Rowena's helping us.

268
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.800
This can't go on forever, can it?

269
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.300
- At least tomorrow will be a good day.
- Will we have cake?

270
00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.800
- Presents?
- A party?

271
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
- It's your birthday, isn't it?
- (triplets laugh)

272
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:26.200
and we sing to let you know

273
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:31.400
¢Ü That you will be queen for the day,
whatever you say goes

274
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.500
Happy birthday, girls.

275
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.700
("Birthday Song")

276
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.300
and chasse for you, Kathleen

277
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:50.000
¢Ü We pirouette for Lacey
and we bow before the queens

278
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.800
¢Ü We sing because we love you
and we sing to let you know

279
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.900
¢Ü That you will be queen for the day...

280
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.600
You're late.

281
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.000
Your Grace,
we were celebrating a special birthday.

282
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.300
That's no excuse. Until you learn
etiquette, the celebrations will wait.

283
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.000
But we were just dancing.
Mother made it a family tradition.

284
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.400
And sadly your mommy
isn't here any more, is she?

285
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.400
And I am responsible
for your upbringing.

286
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.000
Dancing is forbidden. Strictly forbidden.
And please don't sing. It's out too.

287
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.400
- But it's our birthday.
- A princess does not talk back.

288
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.500
No dancing until you know
how to act like royalty.

289
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500
(Lacey) Where's Papa?

290
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.600
He's never forgotten our birthday.

291
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.000
(Ashlyn) We still have a present for you.

292
00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:01.200
When we turned five, Mother gave
each of us a copy of her favourite story.

293
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.300
She had one made for each daughter.

294
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.800
"The Dancing Princess".

295
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.000
"So the princess danced
on each of the special stones,

296
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.800
then, on the 12th one, she twirled
three times and a secret door opened."

297
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.800
Where did it go?

298
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:31.700
"She walked through a glowing light into
a magic land with trees of silver and gold,

299
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.300
flowers made of jewels."

300
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.500
"Across the lake
was a golden pavilion."

301
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.500
"The princess danced and danced
to her heart's content."

302
00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.100
"She wanted to stay forever,
but that was not to be."

303
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.800
"The magic land vanished after the third
night. The princess was heartbroken,

304
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.400
until she realised she had brought
some magic back with her,

305
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.400
and it was hers to keep forever."

306
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.700
- What kind of magic?
- How did she do it?

307
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.600
- It doesn't say.
- Whoa!

308
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.300
Kathleen, let me see your book.

309
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.500
Quick. See if you can match the flower
on your book to a flower on a stone.

310
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.800
- I found a match.
- Me too.

311
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.200
Me too.

312
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.400
- Here's mine.
- (Courtney) What does it mean?

313
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:52.000
I have a feeling... The story says
the princess danced from stone to stone.

314
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.600
Maybe a different order.
Oldest to youngest.

315
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.200
Where's yours, Ashlyn?

316
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.200
Blair?

317
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.700
Huh!

318
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.800
Courtney.

319
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.500
Delia.

320
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.000
Edeline.

321
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.900
Fallon.

322
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.600
Me.

323
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.600
Hadley.

324
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.900
Isla.

325
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.500
Janessa.

326
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.100
Kathleen.

327
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.600
And Lacey.

328
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.900
Huh?

329
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.800
Why didn't mine work?

330
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.500
I forgot something.
The princess twirled three times.

331
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.700
(all gasp)

332
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.700
(Lacey) Whoa! Wow!

333
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.000
Wow!

334
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.200
Who's coming with me?

335
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.000
Amazing.

336
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.100
Pinch me.
I'm dreaming.

337
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.800
Then I'm having the same dream.

338
00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.200
- (Hadley) What do you think...
- (lsla) That is?

339
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.600
Let's find out.

340
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.200
(Delia) The trees are gold and silver.

341
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.600
(Edeline) It's just like in the story.

342
00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.100
Amazing.

343
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.900
Look at all the flowers.

344
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.000
- Whoa!
- Look!

345
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.700
Oh, it's so pretty.

346
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.600
(Genevieve) It's just like
Mother's dance pavilion.

347
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.200
I wish we had some music.

348
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.200
Did you see that?

349
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.900
(classical music plays)

350
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.900
Come on, Lacey, dance with me.

351
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.400
Whoa.

352
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.800
Something like this
always happens to me.

353
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.300
I thought
you were dancing beautifully.

354
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.100
Come on, let's wash it off.

355
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.700
- How did it?
- I don't know.

356
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.900
I could use this all the time.

357
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
- Wow! I actually wore out my shoes.
- Me too.

358
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.800
- It's a sign, you know.
- Of what?

359
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.300
That we've danced enough
for one night.

360
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.200
We better go home
before Rowena finds out we're gone.

361
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.200
Oh, I hate to leave.
I could dance forever and ever and ever.

362
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.700
- Did you like your birthday after all?
- Yes.

363
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.900
Thanks, Genevieve.

364
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.100
Good night, girls.

365
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300
Night, Twyla.

366
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.000
(Rowena) Good morning, ladies.

367
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.400
(princesses) Good morning.

368
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.500
Oh, wide awake, I see.

369
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.200
We're fine, thank you.

370
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.200
Someone was up
way past their bedtime.

371
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.200
Desmond, wake them up.

372
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.500
(princesses gasp)

373
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.800
That's better.

374
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.800
So, what exactly
were you doing last night?

375
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.600
- A visitor for the duchess.
- Yes?

376
00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.000
A Mr Fabian is here.

377
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.800
Oh! Oh. Oh, yes.
Yes, I was expecting him.

378
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.700
I want answers when I return.

379
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.900
She's in a hurry.

380
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.900
And the king requests
his daughters visit him in his quarters.

381
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
(murmur excitedly)

382
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.400
Papa?

383
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.500
Well, look who's here.
The wild bunch.

384
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.600
- Are you sick?
- No, just tired.

385
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.300
I didn't feel...
I didn't feel up to breakfast this morning.

386
00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.800
Papa, you won't believe
what happened last night.

387
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.400
Last night?
Don't remind me.

388
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.400
We were supposed to celebrate your
birthday and I fell asleep. Inexcusable.

389
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.100
- Is it too late to give you your presents?
- (triplets) No!

390
00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.500
(triplets giggle)

391
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
- Oooh, pretty.
- Thank you, Papa.

392
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:02.400
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes, Papa.

393
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.500
(triplets giggle)

394
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.200
Pretty.

395
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.700
(music plays)

396
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.400
Not any more.

397
00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.600
Hah! Pretentious swill.

398
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.900
(laughs)

399
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.300
Too soft.

400
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.900
Too hard.

401
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.800
Just right.

402
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.800
- Ouch.
- Oh. The tiger has a boo-boo.

403
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.700
Who said you could come in here?

404
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.700
Let me think.
Who was it?

405
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:12.200
Oh, yeah. Me!
Got a problem with that?

406
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.900
- What's going on here?
- Clear out, Brutus.

407
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.200
Make me.

408
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.600
Those don't belong to you.

409
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.200
Or you.

410
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.700
What do you think you're doing?

411
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.900
The princesses' dancing shoes?

412
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.400
Worn through.
The spoilt brats have been out dancing.

413
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.300
Do you know what this means?
Do you?

414
00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.000
Princes!
They're out dancing with princes.

415
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.800
Do you know what that means?

416
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.500
No, you don't.
You're still a monkey.

417
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.900
Marriage is what it means.
If princes fall for those pampered pretties,

418
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.400
my plans are ruined.

419
00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.300
(distant singing)

420
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.700
What's that?

421
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.500
What are they up to?

422
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.400
(sing "Sacerdotes Domini"
by William Byrd)

423
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.400
(door opens)

424
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.400
- Come in, Rowena.
- (Rowena) Oh!

425
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.100
So much commotion.
I thought you were unwell.

426
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.500
I am, but I love
when they sing for me.

427
00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.300
Look how pale you are,
dear cousin.

428
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.900
That's enough for now, girls.
Out. Out, please. Please, out.

429
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.600
- But, Papa...
- Rowena's right.

430
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.300
I'm not feeling so well.

431
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.600
Some tea will help.

432
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:40.300
- Papa, maybe you should call the doctor.
- (Rowena drops teaspoon)

433
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.800
Good idea, Genevieve.

434
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.500
Eyes cloudy, skin clammy.

435
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.700
I sound like a fish.

436
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.900
Sense of humour intact.

437
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.500
Well, Your Highness,
if you continue to rest and take this elixir,

438
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.800
I believe you will recover shortly.

439
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.200
That's good news.

440
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:07.000
Allow me, Doctor.
I'll take care of everything.

441
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:09.300
Twice daily should do the trick.

442
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.400
Your Highness.

443
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.900
Now, you rest, cousin.

444
00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.200
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Derek.

445
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.800
The princesses are waiting
in their mother's garden.

446
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.200
I've brought new shoes, as you requested.
Were the ones before not to your liking?

447
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.000
Not at all.
We just wore them out.

448
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.000
We've been out dancing.

449
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.100
One,

450
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.900
two,

451
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
three, and four,

452
00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.200
five,

453
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.100
six,

454
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.000
seven,

455
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.200
eight,

456
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.000
nine, and ten,

457
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:32.700
eleven,

458
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.500
twelve.

459
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.000
A magical time.

460
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.900
(Ashlyn) Can you fix them, Derek?

461
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.500
- (Derek) Is that gold dust?
- It's... a secret.

462
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.700
Oh. Of course.
I didn't mean to pry.

463
00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:57.200
I didn't think you were prying.
It's just... Never mind.

464
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.700
Derek, may I ask you a favour?

465
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.000
Of course, Your Highness.

466
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:11.000
This morning, I saw Duchess Rowena
give something to a man, a Mr Fabian.

467
00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.100
He was short with a beard
and he wore a blue coat.

468
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.600
- I'm afraid I don't know him.
- Would you find out who he is?

469
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.800
Without letting the duchess know.
I don't trust her.

470
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.400
(Twyla) Meeeeow!

471
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.300
(Felix) Hey, hey, hey!
Watch the feathers.

472
00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.500
Twyla, please.

473
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.700
- Lock her up and throw away the key.
- Felix!

474
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.000
Sorry, Your Highness.

475
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.900
- What are you doing?
- Me? The cat started it.

476
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Twyla!

477
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.800
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

478
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.600
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Excellent.

479
00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.300
I'll see you all in the morning.
No excuses. Good night.

480
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.300
I said good night.

481
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.500
(princesses) Good night, my lady.

482
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.600
I want to know where they go, to whom
they speak and when they sneeze.

483
00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.900
Of course, Your Grace. My only reward
is your happiness, my lady.

484
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Correct, Desmond.

485
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:43.700
- Is she gone? I thought I heard voices.
- I don't hear anything now.

486
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.100
Let's go.

487
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.900
(Genevieve) A whole night
to forget Rowena and her rules.

488
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.300
What shall we dance to first?

489
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.900
- We love...
- Ballet.

490
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.400
- Good idea.
- Yay, ballet!

491
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.700
I wish we were dressed
like ballerinas.

492
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.300
We wish we had ballet music.

493
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.700
(¢Ü " Theme from Symphony No.4, Op.90,
'Italian" by Felix Mendelssohn)

494
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.900
Who am I?

495
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
- The Duchess of Doom.
- You mean the Duchess of Don't.

496
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.200
(imitating Rowena)
Don't do this. Don't do that.

497
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.800
Don't, don't, don't!

498
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.900
(laugh)

499
00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:54.900
He came a long way
to visit Duchess Rowena.

500
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.400
Mr Fabian?

501
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.600
You have me at a disadvantage.

502
00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.400
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

503
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.300
I've been asked to inquire
about your business with the duchess.

504
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.500
That's between me
and the duchess, isn't it?

505
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.400
I wouldn't want
to get my master angry.

506
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.300
The bird talks?

507
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.800
Last time somebody refused my master,
the fool was never heard from again.

508
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:10.200
- That's not true.
- Oh, you're right. They did find a shoe.

509
00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.700
Please.
I'm just a simple apothecary.

510
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.900
I sell herbs, remedies.

511
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:20.900
That's all.

512
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
What did you sell the duchess?

513
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.600
I almost didn't sell her anything.

514
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.600
Everybody knows
she doesn't pay her bills.

515
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.500
This time, however,
she came through.

516
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.100
Small, but it's silver.

517
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.100
"Queen Isabella".

518
00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.200
So, how much are you asking?

519
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.500
Oh, that's a laugh.
What do we have worth a silver goblet?

520
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.200
A talking bird might do it.

521
00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.800
(gulps)

522
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.200
Derek? Derek?

523
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.400
You wouldn't.

524
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.400
What's wrong, Felix?
Nothing to say?

525
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.700
Uh... thanks?

526
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:17.100
- Let's go. We have a long walk.
- Where are we going?

527
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.300
We need to show
Princess Genevieve the goblet.

528
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.400
That will be a long walk for you. I hope
you made a pair of shoes for yourself.

529
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:28.800
Don't make me wish
I kept the horse instead of you.

530
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.200
Never mind.
Forget I'm even here.

531
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.500
Well?

532
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.800
Nobody came in or out.

533
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.200
I was here all night, Your Grace.

534
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:48.300
Wonderful.

535
00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:56.400
Good morning, girls.
A beautiful day, isn't it?

536
00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.600
Rise and shine.
We have a busy day ahead of us.

537
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.800
Weren't these new yesterday?

538
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.800
Line up this instant.

539
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.300
Where were you dancing last night?

540
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.700
- Answer me, Delia.
- I'm Edeline.

541
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.100
I don't care.
Answer me.

542
00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.500
We, uh...

543
00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.600
we danced at a pavilion.

544
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:41.700
How did you get there? Blair?

545
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.900
- I'm Kathleen.
- (Rowena) So what?

546
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.600
The magic boat took us.

547
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:51.000
Please. How did you get out of here
without Desmond seeing you?

548
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.600
- The magic gateway.
- Magic this, magic that.

549
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.100
You're all lying to me.

550
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.900
You're the runt of this family.
Tell me the truth or you'll all pay.

551
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.400
- How can you talk to her that way?
- But... but it is the truth.

552
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:08.500
How dare you talk back to me?

553
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.300
You're no better
than common maids.

554
00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:17.900
Maybe if I treat you like maids, you'll
change your minds about lying to me.

555
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.900
This morning
you shall clean the front garden.

556
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.300
- I want it spotless.
- But we were supposed to...

557
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.400
Talking back.
Now you'll scrub the steps as well.

558
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.500
(Blair) We can't even sing
to pass the time.

559
00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.900
- I don't understand why Papa...
- Won't listen to us.

560
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.600
How did everything get so awful?

561
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:49.700
(Delia sighs) At least the garden's done.
All that's left is the steps.

562
00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.500
- Oh.
- I...

563
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.900
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

564
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.300
Lacey!

565
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.300
- Want some company?
- Guess so.

566
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.400
I used to come here
when I was upset.

567
00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.700
Why can't I be good at something?

568
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.500
Edeline and Delia
are good at sports,

569
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:23.800
Courtney's read every book ever written,
Blair rides her horses,

570
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.200
and you're the most beautiful dancer.

571
00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:32.000
- I thought you'd say I'm always late.
- That too.

572
00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:36.200
You probably don't remember,
but Mother always told us:

573
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:40.600
Big or small,
there's a difference only you can make.

574
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:55.700
It's been a long day. We'll feel better
if we say good night to Papa.

575
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:02.000
(Randolph) I just don't understand
why I'm still sick.

576
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.100
Frankly, I'm not surprised,
with the burdens you carry.

577
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.500
12 of them, if you know what I mean.

578
00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.000
(Randolph) 12 burdens.

579
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.300
My daughters do worry me.

580
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.100
I must admit, I lose sleep over them.

581
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.300
But they're hardly burdens.

582
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.900
They're the best part of my life.

583
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.600
Could this day get any worse?

584
00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.000
I ache all over.

585
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.700
- Did you see Papa?
- Not exactly.

586
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:49.000
Tired? Sore? Frustrated?
Now maybe I can hear the truth.

587
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.300
We told you the truth.

588
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:56.200
That ridiculous story? What else?
Flowers with diamonds on them?

589
00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:58.800
Not all the flowers.

590
00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.100
Now you're mocking me.
Apparently you didn't learn your lesson.

591
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.400
Tomorrow you'll clean the stables.

592
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.900
As for tonight, I'm locking you in.

593
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.200
Nobody's going dancing,
I promise you that.

594
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:16.100
- Papa would never lock us in.
- (Rowena) Your father is sick.

595
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.000
And who can blame him?
Taking care of you with your wild ways.

596
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:25.400
If you really want your father to get better,
you'll leave him alone.

597
00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.500
I have failed you again, my grace.

598
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:44.100
- How may I redeem myself?
- We'll see, won't we?

599
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:47.200
If anybody - anybody - sneaks in or out,

600
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.400
alert me at once.

601
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:01.000
I never realised Papa
was so disappointed in us.

602
00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.500
I heard him tell Rowena
that we're burdens.

603
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.100
- He did?
- That's terrible.

604
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.900
Everything's so wrong here.

605
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.300
Twyla has the right idea.

606
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:22.200
There's still one place we can go
where we won't disappoint anybody.

607
00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.700
- We'll give Papa some time...
- To get better.

608
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:28.900
Maybe it's best if we go.

609
00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:39.200
Nobody came or left, my lady.

610
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.400
Desmond, get in here.

611
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.600
Do you see any princesses?

612
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.100
Well, uh...

613
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.600
Neither do I!

614
00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.100
But I never left the door.

615
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:03.800
Are you telling me they just vanished
into thin air? Find them!

616
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.100
The poor man. He's never been the same
since his Isabella passed away.

617
00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.300
Ah, yes.
A broken heart.

618
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:41.000
Well, I should've realised.
In that case, medicine can't help him.

619
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.500
That's what I was afraid of.

620
00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:49.500
Now, now. Don't give up hope,
Your Grace. I'll check in tomorrow.

621
00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.400
Yes, please do.

622
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.500
Hello, sir.
May I see Princess Genevieve?

623
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:06.000
Haven't you heard?
The princesses are missing.

624
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.400
- Missing?
- This cannot be good.

625
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:12.900
I heard Duchess Rowena say
they've run away.

626
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.100
You, cobbler.
We don't need you today.

627
00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.500
But I need to see Princess Genevieve.

628
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:21.300
I said, be gone!

629
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.800
Tell me you're going to leave.

630
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.900
Eventually.

631
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.700
This is risky.
Risky!

632
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.200
You're crazy. If you're caught,
you'll be thrown in the dungeon.

633
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.100
If you don't pipe down,
we'll both be thrown in the dungeon.

634
00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:02.000
Satisfied?
She isn't here. Now let's go.

635
00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.000
My shoe polish.

636
00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.500
Over there, and there.

637
00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.200
Newsflash.
She walked in her own room.

638
00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:17.000
But not everywhere. She started here,
where the polish is thickest.

639
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:19.200
You have got to be kidding.

640
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.100
Ten, eleven, twelve.

641
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.900
Twelve steps.
Her dance!

642
00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.100
One.

643
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:35.100
- What did you do?
- Two,

644
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:39.700
three, four,

645
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.200
five...

646
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.300
(Felix) My,
weren't we paying close attention?

647
00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:54.500
(sing " Theme from Symphony No.4,
Op.90, 'Italian" by Felix Mendelssohn)

648
00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.500
Wouldn't it be nice
if we had a dancing partner?

649
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:05.100
I wish I could dance
with a handsome prince.

650
00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.400
I'd love to.

651
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600
I wish I could dance with a prince too.

652
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.900
I wish that too.

653
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.000
This is what
you wanted to show me?

654
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.600
I'm aware the princesses are gone.

655
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
What on earth are you doing?

656
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.000
Wasting my time.

657
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.600
(gasps)

658
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.200
So there was a method
to your madness.

659
01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.000
(Derek) Princess Genevieve.

660
01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.000
Derek? What are you doing here?
How did you find us?

661
01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:28.400
A lucky guess.
You were right not to trust the duchess.

662
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.300
She gave this
to the stranger you saw.

663
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.300
Rowena's been stealing from Mother?

664
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.500
He gave up his horse for that.

665
01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.700
You did?
Or is that just the bird talking?

666
01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.900
Doesn't matter.
It belongs to you, not him.

667
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.200
I don't know what to say.

668
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.000
The spoilt brats
were telling the truth.

669
01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.000
I wish I could see what's going on.

670
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.800
Will wonders never cease?

671
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.600
Get me some of those flowers.

672
01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:20.200
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

673
01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.300
eight, nine,
ten, eleven, twelve.

674
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.100
All accounted for.
How very convenient.

675
01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.500
Hurry.
Opportunity knocks.

676
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.500
Why would Rowena
steal Mother's goblet?

677
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.300
And give it to an apothecary?

678
01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.500
We have to go home and tell Papa.

679
01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.400
If we leave now,
we can never come back.

680
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.400
- Why not?
- Mother's story.

681
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.400
The princess only visited the land
three times before it vanished forever.

682
01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.100
I can't imagine never coming back.

683
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.700
Maybe we can stay
just a little longer.

684
01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.500
Rowena may not think we're proper
princesses, but we are princesses.

685
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.300
We can't turn our backs
when things get difficult. Papa needs us.

686
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.500
What's happening?

687
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.500
Smash them.
Smash them all.

688
01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:33.400
That one next.
That one. And that one.

689
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:37.400
It's all disappearing.

690
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.800
And the last one.

691
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.900
- How will we get back?
- What are we going to do?

692
01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:01.000
- My daughters, are they coming soon?
- (Rowena) Haven't they visited you yet?

693
01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:07.400
Oh, I hate to say it, but your daughters
are not the most responsible girls.

694
01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.600
I appreciate
all that you're doing for them.

695
01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:13.500
I only wish I could do more.

696
01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:16.600
Well, perhaps you can.

697
01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.500
Would you ever consider
standing in for me?

698
01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.400
Just until I recover.

699
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.600
I would do anything to assist you,
Your Highness. You know I would.

700
01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:33.000
But who would listen to me?
I'm not the queen.

701
01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.800
I, King Randolph,

702
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:44.000
hereby proclaim
Duchess Rowena to be queen

703
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.900
until I can resume my royal duties.

704
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.700
The royal seal.

705
01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.300
Your Highness.

706
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.400
You can count on me, dear cousin.

707
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:16.400
(Courtney) What do you think happened?

708
01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.000
(Genevieve) I can't believe
a place our mother loved could trap us.

709
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.600
I wish to know the way out.

710
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:37.400
- We danced our way in.
- So we can dance our way out.

711
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.500
One, two...

712
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.700
Hm. It's not working.

713
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.900
Let me try.

714
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.400
One,

715
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500
two...

716
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.000
That's odd.

717
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.700
What do we do now?

718
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:58.500
It seems so right.

719
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.100
Oh!

720
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.700
You have to dance together.

721
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:17.200
Oh! How romantic!

722
01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.100
What are you waiting for?
An invitation?

723
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.100
May I have this dance?

724
01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:34.300
Of course.

725
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.600
(¢Ü " Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses
Theme" by Arnie Roth)

726
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.900
Until the king recovers,
I am queen.

727
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.700
I've hired you to protect me.

728
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:25.800
- And the princesses?
- (Rowena) Traitors, you mean.

729
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.200
They've run away
in the king's time of need.

730
01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.900
If you see them, which I doubt,
throw them in the dungeon.

731
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.800
As you wish, Your Highness.

732
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.900
Follow me.

733
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:51.200
Mother's dance pavilion?

734
01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.100
I'm not surprised it leads here.

735
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.900
- I'll miss going there.
- We all will.

736
01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.500
Let's find Papa.

737
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.800
(guard) Queen Rowena
has given us orders.

738
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.100
Queen?

739
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.700
Capture the princesses
and throw them in the dungeon.

740
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:20.000
- And the king?
- He's sick and won't last the night.

741
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.100
How did this happen?

742
01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.600
- Did they just say Papa was ill?
- We have to save him.

743
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.000
- What about Desmond?
- And all the new guards?

744
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.900
And if Rowena is queen...

745
01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.400
We still have something
Rowena doesn't.

746
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.000
The power of 12.

747
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.500
What are we?
Invisible?

748
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.100
Whoa!

749
01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.700
I'll bring the doctor as fast as I can.

750
01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.500
Hey! Hey!

751
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.600
Come back here!

752
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.100
To the left. Left. Left.

753
01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.600
My left. Yes.

754
01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.800
Now straighten it.

755
01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.600
Much better.

756
01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:40.600
Aaargh!

757
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.100
- We're here.
- (guard) Hey. Hey, you! Halt!

758
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.700
Cousin, I have your tea.

759
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.600
(Genevieve) Oh, Desmond.

760
01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.500
Hey!
Come here!

761
01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.700
Whoaaaa!

762
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.600
(crash)

763
01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:00.700
Hey! Hey!
Let me out of here!

764
01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.000
(Janessa) I wonder what's happening.

765
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.900
I think I should give this to Genevieve.

766
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.900
But she said stay right here
till she gets back.

767
01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.000
It can't wait.

768
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.700
Lacey, no!

769
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.300
That's it, cousin.
The very last drop.

770
01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.000
Dizzy. My head.

771
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.400
(groans)

772
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.400
You won't be missed, Randolph.
At least, not by me. Ha ha ha!

773
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.500
Rowena, what have you...

774
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.300
done?

775
01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.300
Yes, you've ruled long enough,
haven't you?

776
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.900
Papa!

777
01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.600
- What did you do to him?
- What? How? How did you?

778
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.700
Desmond?
Desmond!

779
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.800
I'm sorry.
He won't be coming.

780
01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:58.500
- What?
- (Genevieve) He's locked up, Rowena.

781
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.700
Just like you're going to be.

782
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.500
Oh, you think so?

783
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.300
I wish for armour
to protect the queen.

784
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.800
(Desmond) Right.

785
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.700
(banging)

786
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.600
I better warn them about Desmond.

787
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
What do you think you are doing?

788
01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.800
- Ow!
- Oh.

789
01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.600
Did that hurt?
What about this one?

790
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:58.100
No, not a purple one.
They're my favourite.

791
01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.200
(snap)

792
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.500
Owww! Aaargh!

793
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.800
(gibbers)

794
01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.700
Thanks, tiger.

795
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.200
Come on.
Get them. Get them!

796
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.300
Nice timing.

797
01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.800
Derek!

798
01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.900
It's over, Rowena.

799
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.600
Genevieve!

800
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.100
Lacey?

801
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.200
Over? Oh, really?
Not if you want to see your sister again.

802
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.000
Always the ringleader.

803
01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.700
Why not give you
what you've always wanted?

804
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:06.500
I wish you would dance
forever and ever and ever!

805
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.600
What?
What's happening?

806
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.100
- I don't know, my lady.
- I... I can't stop.

807
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:23.200
Coming, Your Grace.

808
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:27.800
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

809
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:31.500
I can't. We're stuck.

810
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:34.600
We're stuck. Ooh!

811
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:40.100
Why are you smiling? Let go of me.
Stop stepping on me! Get off, you big oaf.

812
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:43.200
- I can't.
- (Rowena) Let go of me!

813
01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.700
Papa?
Papa, can you hear me?

814
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.800
I think I can help him.

815
01:15:56.100 --> 01:16:00.900
It's from the lake.
I took some after I scraped my knee.

816
01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:19.800
(Genevieve) It's working.

817
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.800
Lacey?
Genevieve?

818
01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:27.700
Oh! We thought we'd lost you.

819
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.100
It was Rowena, poisoning me.

820
01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:35.000
How could I have been so blind?

821
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:39.500
We let you down, Papa.
We'll do better. Try to be more proper.

822
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.100
No.

823
01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.600
You are each special,

824
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.700
beautiful princesses,

825
01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.700
and you'll do great things
in your own way,

826
01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:51.900
just as your mother always told me.

827
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.500
Oh, my dear Lacey.

828
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.200
Where would I be without you?

829
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:04.800
- You lead because you're the duchess.
- Stop it! Let go of me. Ow!

830
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.900
- Oops. Sorry.
- Stop stepping on me.

831
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.800
Have you got two left feet?
Stop holding on to me!

832
01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.000
- (Desmond) I can't.
- (Brutus) Wait for me!

833
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.100
- (Rowena) Get off! Stop holding on. Ow!
- Sorry.

834
01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.800
- (Rowena) Let go!
- You're a lovely dancer.

835
01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.700
You know,
I should've brought my other shoes.

836
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
You look really pretty.

837
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.100
Thank you.

838
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.100
(Edeline) We're here, Papa.

839
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.100
Hello, Papa.

840
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.400
Today is truly an amazing day.

841
01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.800
Yes, Papa.

842
01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.800
I'm finally on time for something.
