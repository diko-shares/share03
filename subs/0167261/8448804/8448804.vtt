00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.000


2
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.300


3
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.498
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

4
00:01:25.336 --> 00:01:30.675
I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

5
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:41.394
Go back to the Shadow.

6
00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:46.107
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!

7
00:01:49.944 --> 00:01:54.532
You shall not pass!

8
00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:23.353
No! No!

9
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.563
Gandalf!

10
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:34.822
Fly, you fools.

11
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.325
No!

12
00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.371
Gandalf!

13
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:51.858
Gandalf!

14
00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.153
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

15
00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.781
Nothing.

16
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.166
Just a dream.

17
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:22.513
Can you see the bottom?

18
00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:26.934
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

19
00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:39.906
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

20
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:44.952
Mr. Frodo!

21
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:49.290
I think I've found the bottom.

22
00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:57.673
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

23
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.093
It's not natural. None of it.

24
00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:06.349
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

25
00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:08.768
Just a bit of seasoning.

26
00:05:09.352 --> 00:05:12.230
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

27
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.899
Roast chicken?!

28
00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:16.776
You never know.

29
00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:20.238
Sam. My dear Sam.

30
00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:25.827
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

31
00:05:27.078 --> 00:05:29.080
It is special.

32
00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.877
It's a little bit of home.

33
00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.591
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

34
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.554
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

35
00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:49.267
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

36
00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:51.853
Real Elvish rope.

37
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.147
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

38
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:57.275
Won't come free in a hurry.

39
00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:08.369
Real Elvish rope.

40
00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:26.971
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

41
00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:29.348
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

42
00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.851
It's just where we can't get.

43
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:36.314
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

44
00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:41.360
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

45
00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:46.324
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

46
00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:48.618
but they did.

47
00:07:01.672 --> 00:07:02.715
Mr. Frodo?

48
00:07:06.636 --> 00:07:08.054
It's the Ring, isn't it?

49
00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:11.641
It's getting heavier.

50
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:26.989
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

51
00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:29.784
Oh, yes. Lovely.

52
00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:32.703
Lembas bread. And look!

53
00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:37.416
More lembas bread.

54
00:07:48.177 --> 00:07:50.137
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

55
00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:53.307
but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

56
00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:57.687
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

57
00:08:03.526 --> 00:08:05.820
Those rain clouds might.

58
00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:42.857
This looks strangely familiar.

59
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:45.943
It's because we've been here before.

60
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.696
We're going in circles.

61
00:08:49.447 --> 00:08:51.282
What is that horrid stink?

62
00:08:51.449 --> 00:08:53.659
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

63
00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:55.745
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

64
00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:00.041
I can smell it.

65
00:09:03.294 --> 00:09:05.755
We're not alone.

66
00:09:19.393 --> 00:09:23.481
The thieves. The thieves.

67
00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:27.610
The filthy little thieves.

68
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:33.324
Where is it?

69
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.244
They stole it from us.

70
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:41.624
My precious.

71
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.753
Curse them, we hates them!

72
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.007
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

73
00:10:45.062 --> 00:10:46.856
This is Sting.

74
00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:48.566
You've seen it before...

75
00:10:48.732 --> 00:10:51.235
haven't you, Gollum?

76
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:58.784
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

77
00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:16.635
It burns!

78
00:11:16.802 --> 00:11:19.096
It burns us!

79
00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:22.099
It freezes!

80
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:26.103
Nasty Elves twisted it.

81
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.939
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

82
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:36.614
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

83
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.408
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

84
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:43.162
That would kill us! Kill us!

85
00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:46.040
It's no more than you deserve!

86
00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:49.752
Maybe he does deserve to die.

87
00:11:52.129 --> 00:11:55.633
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

88
00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:03.933
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

89
00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.936
Take it off us.

90
00:12:10.064 --> 00:12:13.984
We swears to do what you wants.

91
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.153
We swears.

92
00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.822
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

93
00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:23.285
We swears...

94
00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:28.249
to serve the master
of the precious.

95
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.211
We will swear on...

96
00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:34.338
on the precious.

97
00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:36.715
Gollum. Gollum.

98
00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:41.011
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

99
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.180
Yes...

100
00:12:43.764 --> 00:12:46.267
on the precious.

101
00:12:48.686 --> 00:12:51.063
On the precious.

102
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:53.732
I don't believe you!

103
00:12:55.734 --> 00:12:59.238
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

104
00:12:59.446 --> 00:13:01.156
He's trying to trick us.

105
00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:04.368
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

106
00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:20.342
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

107
00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:25.014
You've been there before?

108
00:13:26.015 --> 00:13:27.599
Yes.

109
00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.113
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

110
00:13:49.747 --> 00:13:53.542
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

111
00:13:53.751 --> 00:13:58.547
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

112
00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:03.010
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

113
00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:06.638
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

114
00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:12.770
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

115
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.814
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

116
00:14:15.981 --> 00:14:21.111
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

117
00:14:24.073 --> 00:14:27.910
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

118
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:32.539
There! What did I tell you?

119
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.917
He's run off, the old villain.

120
00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:37.628
So much for his promises.

121
00:14:37.795 --> 00:14:39.421
This way, Hobbits.

122
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.715
Follow me!

123
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.939
Merry!

124
00:14:57.898 --> 00:14:59.400
Merry!

125
00:15:04.947 --> 00:15:08.742
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

126
00:15:08.909 --> 00:15:10.744
He wants the Shire-rats now.

127
00:15:11.578 --> 00:15:16.166
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

128
00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:20.295
Saruman will have his prize.

129
00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:23.632
We will deliver them.

130
00:15:29.847 --> 00:15:31.223
Merry!

131
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.725
Merry? Wake up.

132
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.064
My friend is sick.

133
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.151
He needs water. Please!

134
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:46.864
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

135
00:15:50.075 --> 00:15:51.743
Stop it!

136
00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.582
Can't take his draught!

137
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.879
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

138
00:16:02.379 --> 00:16:05.299
You want some? Huh?

139
00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:08.886
Then keep your mouth shut.

140
00:16:12.306 --> 00:16:14.391
Merry.

141
00:16:15.184 --> 00:16:16.727
Hello, Pip.

142
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.981
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

143
00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:23.692
- It was just an act.
- An act?

144
00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:27.196
See? I fooled you too.

145
00:16:29.907 --> 00:16:31.617
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

146
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.913
What is it? What do you smell?

147
00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:38.207
Man-flesh.

148
00:16:40.334 --> 00:16:42.711
They've picked up our trail.

149
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:44.922
Aragorn.

150
00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:48.467
Let's move!

151
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:14.576
Their pace has quickened.

152
00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:17.579
They must have caught our scent.

153
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.498
Hurry!

154
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.962
Come on, Gimli!

155
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.009
Three days and nights pursuit.

156
00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:34.137
No food. No rest.

157
00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:38.308
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

158
00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:13.010
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

159
00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:16.638
They may yet be alive.

160
00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:20.142
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

161
00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:25.230
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

162
00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:29.693
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

163
00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:33.530
Very dangerous over short distances.

164
00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:46.960
Rohan.

165
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:49.921
Home of the Horse-lords.

166
00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:53.675
There's something strange at work here.

167
00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:56.845
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

168
00:18:57.054 --> 00:18:59.973
Sets its will against us.

169
00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:08.065
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

170
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.817
The Uruks turn northeast.

171
00:19:11.652 --> 00:19:13.820
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

172
00:19:14.696 --> 00:19:15.947
Saruman.

173
00:19:24.373 --> 00:19:27.542
The world is changing.

174
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:33.340
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

175
00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.760
and Mordor?

176
00:19:38.428 --> 00:19:44.059
To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...

177
00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:47.896
and the union of the two towers?

178
00:19:54.403 --> 00:19:57.364
Together, my Lord Sauron...

179
00:19:57.531 --> 00:20:01.118
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

180
00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:21.388
The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.

181
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.225
The forests will fall.

182
00:20:27.144 --> 00:20:29.980
A new order will rise.

183
00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:35.944
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

184
00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:40.157
and the iron fists of the Orc.

185
00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:55.797
I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

186
00:20:55.964 --> 00:20:57.632
But, my lord, there are too many!

187
00:20:57.799 --> 00:21:00.802
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

188
00:21:00.969 --> 00:21:04.181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

189
00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:07.184
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

190
00:21:08.477 --> 00:21:12.773
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

191
00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:16.526
- Burn it.
- Yes.

192
00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.529
We will fight for you.

193
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.698
Swear it.

194
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:36.963
We will die for Saruman.

195
00:21:38.048 --> 00:21:40.050
The Horse-Men took your lands.

196
00:21:40.217 --> 00:21:44.763
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

197
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.348
Murderers!

198
00:21:47.265 --> 00:21:49.392
Take back the lands they stole from you.

199
00:21:49.559 --> 00:21:51.353
Burn every village!

200
00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:59.736
We have only to
remove those who oppose us.

201
00:22:00.237 --> 00:22:02.781
It will begin in Rohan.

202
00:22:03.532 --> 00:22:07.035
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

203
00:22:07.244 --> 00:22:09.037
But no more.

204
00:22:09.246 --> 00:22:11.456
Éothain! Éothain!

205
00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:16.294
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

206
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.339
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

207
00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.174
He is too big for him.

208
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:24.344
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

209
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:27.055
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

210
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:30.225
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

211
00:22:30.392 --> 00:22:34.104
Freda, I will find you there.

212
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:40.777
Quickly!

213
00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:48.702
Go, child.

214
00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:03.550
Rohan, my lord...

215
00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:06.720
is ready to fall.

216
00:23:17.939 --> 00:23:19.482
Théodred.

217
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.318
Find the king's son!

218
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:43.840
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

219
00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:47.510
My Lord Éomer, over here!

220
00:23:56.353 --> 00:23:58.021
He's alive.

221
00:24:28.969 --> 00:24:31.054
Théodred.

222
00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:47.445
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

223
00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:50.407
He was ambushed by Orcs.

224
00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:55.537
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

225
00:24:55.912 --> 00:24:58.415
That is a lie.

226
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:05.463
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

227
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.134
Gríma.

228
00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:12.470
Gríma.

229
00:25:15.015 --> 00:25:16.558
Gríma.

230
00:25:17.308 --> 00:25:20.437
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

231
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.441
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

232
00:25:25.066 --> 00:25:27.944
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

233
00:25:35.785 --> 00:25:41.583
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

234
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.210
Can you not see?

235
00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:49.424
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

236
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:52.135
your warmongering.

237
00:25:54.345 --> 00:25:56.306
Warmongering?

238
00:25:56.473 --> 00:25:58.641
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

239
00:25:59.476 --> 00:26:01.853
What was the promised price, Gríma?

240
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:05.774
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

241
00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:20.872
Too long have you watched my sister.

242
00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:23.041
Too long have you haunted her steps.

243
00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:35.428
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

244
00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:36.763
Too much.

245
00:26:39.099 --> 00:26:43.895
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

246
00:26:44.062 --> 00:26:48.858
and all its domains
under pain of death.

247
00:26:49.317 --> 00:26:51.653
You have no authority here.

248
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.280
Your orders mean nothing.

249
00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:58.660
This order does not come from me.

250
00:26:58.827 --> 00:27:01.037
It comes from the king.

251
00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:04.249
He signed it this morning.

252
00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.491
Keep breathing. That's the key.

253
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.410
Breathe.

254
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:48.376
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

255
00:28:04.601 --> 00:28:06.561
We're not going no further...

256
00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:08.730
until we've had a breather.

257
00:28:09.272 --> 00:28:11.232
Get a fire going!

258
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.905
Merry!

259
00:28:17.238 --> 00:28:18.615
Merry!

260
00:28:20.283 --> 00:28:25.496
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

261
00:28:34.923 --> 00:28:37.133
What's making that noise?

262
00:28:38.718 --> 00:28:40.178
It's the trees.

263
00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:41.971
What?

264
00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:46.142
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

265
00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:50.813
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

266
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.523
and come alive.

267
00:28:52.774 --> 00:28:54.442
Alive?

268
00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:57.028
Trees that could whisper...

269
00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:00.490
talk to each other...

270
00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:02.533
even move.

271
00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.371
I'm starving.

272
00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:10.667
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

273
00:29:10.959 --> 00:29:12.252
Yeah!

274
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.713
Why can't we have some meat?!

275
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:20.301
What about them?

276
00:29:20.468 --> 00:29:22.345
They're fresh.

277
00:29:23.012 --> 00:29:26.808
They are not for eating.

278
00:29:32.772 --> 00:29:34.732
What about their legs?

279
00:29:34.899 --> 00:29:37.235
They don't need those.

280
00:29:38.695 --> 00:29:41.864
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

281
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.579
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

282
00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:50.873
Alive?

283
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:58.131
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

284
00:30:00.508 --> 00:30:03.886
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

285
00:30:04.053 --> 00:30:07.098
The master wants it for the war.

286
00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:11.853
- They think we have the Ring.
- Shh.

287
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.439
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

288
00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:18.276
Just a mouthful...

289
00:30:18.443 --> 00:30:19.652
a bit of the flank.

290
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:30.038
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

291
00:30:36.627 --> 00:30:37.879
Pippin.

292
00:30:38.046 --> 00:30:39.756
Let's go.

293
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:49.724
Go on.

294
00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:51.392
Call for help.

295
00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:53.853
Squeal.

296
00:30:54.062 --> 00:30:57.273
No one's going to save you now.

297
00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:07.867
Pippin!

298
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.602
A red sun rises.

299
00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:38.022
Blood has been spilled this night.

300
00:32:09.262 --> 00:32:11.139
Riders of Rohan...

301
00:32:11.556 --> 00:32:13.975
what news from the Mark?

302
00:32:41.711 --> 00:32:46.132
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

303
00:32:46.924 --> 00:32:48.176
Speak quickly!

304
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:53.181
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

305
00:33:02.315 --> 00:33:04.901
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

306
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.695
if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

307
00:33:08.738 --> 00:33:10.823
You would die before your stroke fell.

308
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.417
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

309
00:33:21.751 --> 00:33:25.963
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

310
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.425
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

311
00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:34.847
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

312
00:33:35.056 --> 00:33:37.266
Not even his own kin.

313
00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:43.731
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

314
00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.858
and claimed lordship over these lands.

315
00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:50.821
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

316
00:33:50.988 --> 00:33:52.740
And for that, we are banished.

317
00:33:54.825 --> 00:33:58.120
The White Wizard is cunning.

318
00:33:58.788 --> 00:34:01.207
He walks here and there, they say...

319
00:34:01.374 --> 00:34:03.459
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

320
00:34:05.294 --> 00:34:09.090
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

321
00:34:09.257 --> 00:34:11.467
We are no spies.

322
00:34:11.634 --> 00:34:14.595
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

323
00:34:14.887 --> 00:34:17.223
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

324
00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:20.476
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

325
00:34:20.643 --> 00:34:23.813
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

326
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.983
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

327
00:34:30.278 --> 00:34:32.280
We left none alive.

328
00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:35.866
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

329
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.582
Dead?

330
00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:47.295
I am sorry.

331
00:34:52.842 --> 00:34:55.136
Hasufel! Arod!

332
00:34:57.013 --> 00:35:01.642
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

333
00:35:02.893 --> 00:35:04.520
Farewell.

334
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.944
Look for your friends.

335
00:35:12.361 --> 00:35:14.614
But do not trust to hope.

336
00:35:16.324 --> 00:35:18.868
It has forsaken these lands.

337
00:35:19.076 --> 00:35:21.078
We ride north!

338
00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:13.589
It's one of their wee belts.

339
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.]
May the find peace after death.

340
00:36:27.311 --> 00:36:29.355
We failed them.

341
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:45.621
A Hobbit lay here.

342
00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:49.125
And the other.

343
00:36:59.885 --> 00:37:01.470
They crawled.

344
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:07.768
Their hands were bound.

345
00:37:19.905 --> 00:37:21.741
Their bonds were cut.

346
00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:39.300
They ran over here.

347
00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.180
They were followed.

348
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:49.101
The belt!

349
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.190
Run!

350
00:37:57.818 --> 00:37:59.218
Tracks lead away from the battle...

351
00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:06.202
into Fangorn Forest.

352
00:38:07.036 --> 00:38:08.496
Fangorn?

353
00:38:08.704 --> 00:38:11.290
What madness drove them in there?

354
00:38:29.016 --> 00:38:32.019
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

355
00:38:38.734 --> 00:38:42.154
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

356
00:38:48.327 --> 00:38:49.370
Come here!

357
00:38:54.875 --> 00:38:57.461
Trees. Climb a tree.

358
00:39:06.804 --> 00:39:08.556
He's gone.

359
00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:22.945
Merry!

360
00:39:34.415 --> 00:39:38.794
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

361
00:39:45.926 --> 00:39:47.469
Run, Merry!

362
00:39:57.313 --> 00:40:01.609
Little Orcs.

363
00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:04.111
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

364
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.155
Tree?

365
00:40:06.322 --> 00:40:09.325
I am no tree!

366
00:40:09.533 --> 00:40:11.744
I am an Ent.

367
00:40:12.328 --> 00:40:14.455
A tree-herder.

368
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.957
A shepherd of the forest.

369
00:40:17.124 --> 00:40:18.459
Don't talk to it, Merry.

370
00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:20.461
Don't encourage it!

371
00:40:20.628 --> 00:40:24.882
Treebeard, some call me.

372
00:40:25.049 --> 00:40:27.009
And whose side are you on?

373
00:40:27.635 --> 00:40:29.261
Side?

374
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.348
I am on nobody's side...

375
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:38.020
because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

376
00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:43.484
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

377
00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:46.236
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

378
00:40:46.403 --> 00:40:48.697
Hobbits?

379
00:40:49.949 --> 00:40:54.870
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

380
00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:59.291
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

381
00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:02.878
They come with fire.

382
00:41:03.087 --> 00:41:05.673
They come with axes.

383
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:10.678
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

384
00:41:10.886 --> 00:41:14.682
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

385
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.685
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

386
00:41:17.893 --> 00:41:19.687
Halflings!

387
00:41:19.895 --> 00:41:21.021
Shire-folk!

388
00:41:21.188 --> 00:41:23.524
Maybe you are...

389
00:41:23.816 --> 00:41:27.444
and maybe you aren't.

390
00:41:28.529 --> 00:41:32.449
The White Wizard will know.

391
00:41:33.242 --> 00:41:35.202
The White Wizard?

392
00:41:36.704 --> 00:41:38.205
Saruman.

393
00:41:50.759 --> 00:41:52.469
See? See?

394
00:41:52.678 --> 00:41:55.055
We've led you out.

395
00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:57.766
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

396
00:42:00.853 --> 00:42:03.439
Very lucky we find you.

397
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.780
Nice Hobbit.

398
00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:17.953
Oh! It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

399
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.748
A swamp, yes, yes.

400
00:42:21.498 --> 00:42:26.253
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

401
00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:32.009
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

402
00:42:35.262 --> 00:42:37.890
I found it. I did.

403
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:40.768
The way through the marshes.

404
00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:44.480
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

405
00:42:44.646 --> 00:42:48.734
They go around for miles and miles.

406
00:42:48.984 --> 00:42:50.360
Come quickly.

407
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:54.615
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

408
00:42:55.783 --> 00:42:59.119
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

409
00:42:59.286 --> 00:43:01.538
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

410
00:43:01.705 --> 00:43:05.125
No, no birdses to eat.

411
00:43:05.375 --> 00:43:09.630
No crunchable birdses.

412
00:43:10.214 --> 00:43:13.092
And we are famished! Yes!

413
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:17.554
Famished we are, precious!

414
00:43:32.528 --> 00:43:34.029
Here.

415
00:43:35.197 --> 00:43:37.241
What does it eats?

416
00:43:37.407 --> 00:43:39.368
Is it tasty?

417
00:43:44.665 --> 00:43:47.292
It tries to chokes us!

418
00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:51.213
We can't eats Hobbit food!

419
00:43:52.923 --> 00:43:56.969
We must starve!

420
00:43:57.136 --> 00:43:59.555
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

421
00:44:00.264 --> 00:44:02.516
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

422
00:44:02.683 --> 00:44:05.561
It does not care if we be hungry.

423
00:44:05.769 --> 00:44:10.566
Does not care if we should die.

424
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.986
Not like master.

425
00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:17.447
Master cares.

426
00:44:18.615 --> 00:44:20.492
Master knows.

427
00:44:22.953 --> 00:44:24.913
Yes.

428
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.708
Precious.

429
00:44:31.295 --> 00:44:34.923
Once it takes hold of us...

430
00:44:36.758 --> 00:44:40.971
it never lets go.

431
00:44:41.638 --> 00:44:42.806
Don't touch me!

432
00:45:15.297 --> 00:45:17.174
There are dead things!

433
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:19.134
Dead faces in the water.

434
00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:27.935
All dead. All rotten.

435
00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:32.231
Elves and Men and Orcses.

436
00:45:32.397 --> 00:45:36.026
A great battle long ago.

437
00:45:36.818 --> 00:45:38.570
Dead Marshes.

438
00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:41.490
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

439
00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:44.952
This way.

440
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:47.871
Don't follow the lights.

441
00:45:49.665 --> 00:45:53.460
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

442
00:45:53.669 --> 00:45:57.798
and light little candles
of their own.

443
00:46:23.991 --> 00:46:25.492
Frodo!

444
00:47:09.995 --> 00:47:14.666
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

445
00:47:14.833 --> 00:47:16.626
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

446
00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:18.754
Are you all right?

447
00:47:47.574 --> 00:47:50.577
So bright.

448
00:47:50.786 --> 00:47:54.581
So beautiful.

449
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.585
Our precious.

450
00:48:00.045 --> 00:48:01.505
What did you say?

451
00:48:01.797 --> 00:48:03.965
Master should be resting.

452
00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:08.220
Master needs to keep up his strength.

453
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.433
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

454
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.102
Gollum. Gollum.

455
00:48:15.268 --> 00:48:17.145
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

456
00:48:17.312 --> 00:48:21.358
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

457
00:48:21.525 --> 00:48:23.110
He said your life was a sad story.

458
00:48:23.318 --> 00:48:27.823
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

459
00:48:27.989 --> 00:48:30.992
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

460
00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:32.953
Were you?

461
00:48:35.122 --> 00:48:37.374
Sméagol.

462
00:48:42.087 --> 00:48:44.631
What did you call me?

463
00:48:45.966 --> 00:48:48.718
That was your name once, wasn't it?

464
00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:51.638
A long time ago.

465
00:48:52.472 --> 00:48:54.641
My name.

466
00:48:55.725 --> 00:48:57.227
My name.

467
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:06.653
Sméagol.

468
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.367
Black Riders!

469
00:49:12.534 --> 00:49:13.869
Hide! Hide!

470
00:49:24.463 --> 00:49:26.756
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

471
00:49:26.923 --> 00:49:30.552
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

472
00:49:31.386 --> 00:49:34.014
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

473
00:49:34.181 --> 00:49:37.100
No, you cannot kill them. No.

474
00:50:04.252 --> 00:50:05.378
Wraiths!

475
00:50:05.545 --> 00:50:07.756
Wraiths on wings!

476
00:50:15.722 --> 00:50:17.807
They are calling for it.

477
00:50:18.016 --> 00:50:21.478
They are calling for the precious.

478
00:50:23.688 --> 00:50:25.815
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

479
00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:27.234
I'm here.

480
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.793
Hurry, Hobbits.

481
00:50:45.335 --> 00:50:49.256
The Black Gate is very close.

482
00:50:56.137 --> 00:50:58.014
Orc blood.

483
00:51:08.024 --> 00:51:09.776
These are strange tracks.

484
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:13.029
The air is so close in here.

485
00:51:14.239 --> 00:51:16.658
This forest is old.

486
00:51:17.492 --> 00:51:19.494
Very old.

487
00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:23.498
Full of memory...

488
00:51:26.126 --> 00:51:28.503
and anger.

489
00:51:34.634 --> 00:51:37.512
The trees are speaking to each other.

490
00:51:37.679 --> 00:51:39.180
Gimli!

491
00:51:39.347 --> 00:51:41.308
Lower your ax.

492
00:51:44.102 --> 00:51:46.855
They have feelings, my friend.

493
00:51:47.397 --> 00:51:49.399
The Elves began it.

494
00:51:49.566 --> 00:51:54.321
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

495
00:51:54.821 --> 00:51:57.157
Talking trees.

496
00:51:57.824 --> 00:52:00.827
What do trees have to talk about?

497
00:52:01.036 --> 00:52:04.247
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

498
00:52:07.203 --> 00:52:09.203
[Aragorn, nad no ennas!]
Aragorn, something's out there!

499
00:52:07.203 --> 00:52:09.203



500
00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:17.342
[Man cenich?]
What do you see?

501
00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:17.342



502
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:20.639
The White Wizard approaches.

503
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:31.107
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

504
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.952
We must be quick.

505
00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:02.180
You are tracking
the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

506
00:53:02.764 --> 00:53:04.182
Where are they?

507
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:07.894
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

508
00:53:08.103 --> 00:53:12.357
They met someone they did not expect.

509
00:53:12.524 --> 00:53:14.651
Does that comfort you?

510
00:53:14.818 --> 00:53:16.778
Who are you?

511
00:53:18.238 --> 00:53:20.240
Show yourself!

512
00:53:29.124 --> 00:53:31.126
It cannot be.

513
00:53:34.045 --> 00:53:35.130
Forgive me.

514
00:53:36.715 --> 00:53:38.633
I mistook you for Saruman.

515
00:53:39.426 --> 00:53:42.178
I am Saruman.

516
00:53:43.722 --> 00:53:47.642
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

517
00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:50.061
You fell.

518
00:53:51.521 --> 00:53:54.065
Through fire...

519
00:53:54.232 --> 00:53:55.525
and water.

520
00:53:56.985 --> 00:53:59.529
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

521
00:53:59.696 --> 00:54:03.450
I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.

522
00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:22.010
Until at last
I threw down my enemy...

523
00:54:22.177 --> 00:54:26.681
and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

524
00:54:32.687 --> 00:54:35.231
Darkness took me...

525
00:54:35.982 --> 00:54:40.069
and I strayed out of thought
and time.

526
00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:43.907
Stars wheeled overhead...

527
00:54:44.199 --> 00:54:48.703
and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.

528
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:52.916
But it was not the end.

529
00:54:53.208 --> 00:54:56.002
I felt life in me again.

530
00:54:57.921 --> 00:55:00.465
I've been sent back...

531
00:55:00.632 --> 00:55:02.217
until my task is done.

532
00:55:02.634 --> 00:55:04.511
Gandalf.

533
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.222
Gandalf?

534
00:55:07.597 --> 00:55:09.390
Yes.

535
00:55:12.227 --> 00:55:13.978
That was what they used to call me.

536
00:55:16.856 --> 00:55:19.108
Gandalf the Grey.

537
00:55:20.443 --> 00:55:22.237
That was my name.

538
00:55:22.445 --> 00:55:23.822
Gandalf.

539
00:55:25.782 --> 00:55:27.867
I am Gandalf the White.

540
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.957
And I come back to you now...

541
00:55:34.123 --> 00:55:36.626
at the turn of the tide.

542
00:55:37.752 --> 00:55:40.755
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

543
00:55:41.464 --> 00:55:44.634
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

544
00:55:45.552 --> 00:55:47.595
That is no short distance!

545
00:55:47.846 --> 00:55:51.057
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

546
00:55:51.266 --> 00:55:53.351
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

547
00:55:53.518 --> 00:55:56.938
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

548
00:55:57.105 --> 00:55:59.107
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

549
00:55:59.274 --> 00:56:03.194
in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

550
00:56:06.114 --> 00:56:09.284
I mean, charming...

551
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:12.203
quite charming forest.

552
00:56:12.787 --> 00:56:16.416
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

553
00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:20.920
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

554
00:56:21.087 --> 00:56:24.549
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

555
00:56:24.716 --> 00:56:28.052
that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

556
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:30.388
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

557
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:34.976
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

558
00:56:37.812 --> 00:56:44.235
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

559
00:56:44.402 --> 00:56:48.031
The Ents are going to wake up...

560
00:56:48.573 --> 00:56:53.077
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

561
00:56:53.828 --> 00:56:54.996
Oh, that's good.

562
00:56:55.163 --> 00:56:57.874
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

563
00:56:58.958 --> 00:57:01.210
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

564
00:57:01.377 --> 00:57:05.048
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

565
00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:08.968
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

566
00:57:31.199 --> 00:57:32.659
That is one of the Mearas...

567
00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:35.620
unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

568
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:55.515
Shadowfax.

569
00:57:58.101 --> 00:58:00.687
He is the lord of all horses...

570
00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:06.234
and has been my friend
through many dangers.

571
00:58:20.498 --> 00:58:24.085
O rowan mine

572
00:58:24.252 --> 00:58:28.047
I saw you shine

573
00:58:28.214 --> 00:58:31.759
Upon a summer's day

574
00:58:32.844 --> 00:58:37.348
Upon your head How golden-red

575
00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:42.228
The crown you bore aloft

576
00:58:42.437 --> 00:58:44.814
Such a beautiful verse.

577
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:49.902
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

578
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:53.322
You might call it far, perhaps.

579
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:58.036
My home lies deep in the forest...

580
00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:02.123
near the roots of the mountain.

581
00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:07.128
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

582
00:59:07.336 --> 00:59:11.340
And safe is where I'll keep you.

583
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:15.970
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

584
00:59:16.345 --> 00:59:19.348
It's one of my own compositions.

585
00:59:19.515 --> 00:59:20.725
Right.

586
00:59:20.892 --> 00:59:27.023
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

587
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:32.070
And the dreams of trees unfold

588
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:38.701
When woodland halls are green and cool

589
00:59:38.868 --> 00:59:42.997
And the wind is in the West

590
00:59:43.414 --> 00:59:46.084
Come back to me

591
00:59:46.626 --> 00:59:51.089
Come back to me

592
00:59:51.255 --> 00:59:57.678
And say my land is best

593
00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.140
Oh.

594
01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:08.815
Sleep, little Shirelings.

595
01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:12.568
Heed no nightly noise.

596
01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:16.656
Sleep till morning light.

597
01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:22.453
I have business in the forest.

598
01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:28.167
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

599
01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:34.048
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

600
01:00:34.215 --> 01:00:39.929
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

601
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.734
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

602
01:00:54.569 --> 01:00:57.155
Sauron will suffer no rival.

603
01:00:57.572 --> 01:01:01.868
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

604
01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:05.454
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

605
01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:08.457
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

606
01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:11.210
The rumor has reached him.

607
01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:14.338
The heir of Númenor still lives.

608
01:01:15.298 --> 01:01:18.134
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

609
01:01:19.427 --> 01:01:21.637
He fears what you may become.

610
01:01:22.889 --> 01:01:26.309
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

611
01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:30.104
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

612
01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:31.772
War is coming.

613
01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:35.526
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

614
01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:38.112
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

615
01:01:38.279 --> 01:01:41.991
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

616
01:01:42.158 --> 01:01:45.244
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

617
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:50.124
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

618
01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:53.085
But for all their cunning...

619
01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:55.838
we have one advantage.

620
01:01:57.965 --> 01:02:00.551
The Ring remains hidden.

621
01:02:01.636 --> 01:02:03.554
And that we should seek to destroy it...

622
01:02:03.721 --> 01:02:06.682
has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

623
01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:10.603
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

624
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.271
in the hands of a Hobbit.

625
01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:16.525
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

626
01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:19.320
We must trust now in Frodo.

627
01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:21.322
Everything depends upon speed...

628
01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:24.492
and the secrecy of his quest.

629
01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:29.789
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

630
01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:33.417
Frodo must finish this task alone.

631
01:02:34.168 --> 01:02:36.462
He's not alone.

632
01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:38.339
Sam went with him.

633
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.216
Did he?

634
01:02:40.383 --> 01:02:45.012
Did he, indeed? Good.

635
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.057
Yes, very good.

636
01:02:56.065 --> 01:03:00.945
The Black Gate of Mordor.

637
01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.242
Oh, save us.

638
01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:15.251
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

639
01:03:17.503 --> 01:03:21.966
Master says to
show him the way into Mordor.

640
01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:25.553
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

641
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.971
I did.

642
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:37.732
That's it, then.

643
01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:40.568
We can't get past that.

644
01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:27.114
Look!

645
01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:28.741
The gate.

646
01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.117
It's opening!

647
01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.543
I can see a way down.

648
01:04:40.294 --> 01:04:42.380
Sam, no!

649
01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:45.925
Master!

650
01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:13.304
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

651
01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:17.224
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

652
01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.518
- Now!
- No!

653
01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.062
No! No, master!

654
01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:25.232
They catch you! They catch you!

655
01:06:26.525 --> 01:06:29.069
Don't take it to him.

656
01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:34.742
He wants the precious.

657
01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:37.953
Always he is looking for it.

658
01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.041
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

659
01:06:42.249 --> 01:06:46.170
But we mustn't let him have it.

660
01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:54.678
No! There's another way.

661
01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.515
More secret. A dark way.

662
01:06:57.806 --> 01:07:01.477
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

663
01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.062
He's up to something.

664
01:07:03.646 --> 01:07:06.232
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

665
01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.151
Yes. There's a path...

666
01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:11.820
and some stairs.

667
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.697
And then...

668
01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:17.201
a tunnel.

669
01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.967
He's led us this far, Sam.

670
01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:34.552
Mr. Frodo, no.

671
01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:37.137
He's been true to his word.

672
01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:43.227
No.

673
01:07:45.354 --> 01:07:46.981
Lead the way, Sméagol.

674
01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:51.527
Good Sméagol always helps.

675
01:08:25.519 --> 01:08:26.520
Hello?

676
01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:31.025
Treebeard?

677
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:33.027
Where has he gone?

678
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.654
I had the loveliest dream last night.

679
01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.991
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

680
01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:41.660
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

681
01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:44.079
you were sick.

682
01:08:45.664 --> 01:08:48.542
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

683
01:08:52.046 --> 01:08:53.964
Did you hear that?

684
01:09:01.055 --> 01:09:02.556
There it is again.

685
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:06.977
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

686
01:09:11.815 --> 01:09:14.735
You just said something... Treeish.

687
01:09:14.902 --> 01:09:18.906
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

688
01:09:26.455 --> 01:09:28.332
You're taller.

689
01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:30.376
- Who?
- You!

690
01:09:30.584 --> 01:09:32.169
- Than what?
- Than me!

691
01:09:32.670 --> 01:09:34.797
I've always been taller than you.

692
01:09:34.963 --> 01:09:39.593
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

693
01:09:40.427 --> 01:09:41.970
Please, Merry.

694
01:09:42.137 --> 01:09:45.974
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

695
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.727
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

696
01:09:51.522 --> 01:09:53.774
3'8"!

697
01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:57.611
Three-foot-eight.

698
01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:02.533
You did something.

699
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:09.915
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

700
01:10:10.833 --> 01:10:12.334
Merry!

701
01:10:12.501 --> 01:10:14.837
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

702
01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:18.924
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

703
01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:21.260
Give me it back. Merry!

704
01:10:23.137 --> 01:10:24.430
What's happening?!

705
01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:26.765
It's got my leg!

706
01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:28.642
Merry!

707
01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:38.360
No!

708
01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:49.663
Help!

709
01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.213
Away with you.

710
01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.174
You should not be waking.

711
01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:05.679
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

712
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.807
Go to sleep.

713
01:11:09.183 --> 01:11:10.976
Away with you.

714
01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:14.480
Come, the forest is waking up.

715
01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:16.982
It isn't safe.

716
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:23.530
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

717
01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:26.742
Anger festers in their hearts.

718
01:11:27.576 --> 01:11:29.203
Black are their thoughts.

719
01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.914
Strong is their hate.

720
01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.833
They will harm you if they can.

721
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.587
There are too few of us now.

722
01:11:38.754 --> 01:11:42.758
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

723
01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:46.011
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

724
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.389
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

725
01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:55.187
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

726
01:11:55.354 --> 01:12:00.609
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

727
01:12:00.859 --> 01:12:02.277
Oh, I'm sorry.

728
01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:06.365
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

729
01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:09.785
We lost them.

730
01:12:09.952 --> 01:12:15.040
And now we cannot find them.

731
01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:21.421
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

732
01:12:21.588 --> 01:12:24.174
Can't say that I have.

733
01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:26.760
You, Pip?

734
01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:30.556
What do they look like?

735
01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:37.688
I don't remember now.

736
01:12:54.079 --> 01:12:58.000
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

737
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.420
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

738
01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:05.007
whose mind is overthrown.

739
01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:09.428
Saruman's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

740
01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:13.265
My lord, your son...

741
01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:15.601
he is dead.

742
01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:18.937
My lord?

743
01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:21.356
Uncle?

744
01:13:28.155 --> 01:13:30.449
Will you not go to him?

745
01:13:33.535 --> 01:13:35.954
Will you do nothing?

746
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:38.123
Be careful what you say.

747
01:13:38.332 --> 01:13:40.459
Do not look for welcome here.

748
01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:08.695
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

749
01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:11.031
What a tragedy for the king...

750
01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:14.201
to lose his only son and heir.

751
01:14:15.369 --> 01:14:19.831
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

752
01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:24.920
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

753
01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:26.546
Leave me alone, snake!

754
01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:29.675
Oh, but you are alone.

755
01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:36.056
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

756
01:14:36.223 --> 01:14:39.685
in the bitter watches of the night...

757
01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:43.522
when all your life seems to shrink.

758
01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:47.901
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

759
01:14:48.068 --> 01:14:52.656
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

760
01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:56.785
So fair.

761
01:14:58.036 --> 01:14:59.413
So cold.

762
01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:03.417
Like a morning of pale spring...

763
01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:07.045
still clinging to winter's chill.

764
01:15:20.809 --> 01:15:23.311
Your words are poison.

765
01:16:55.821 --> 01:16:58.323
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

766
01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:12.587
Ah.

767
01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:16.550
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

768
01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:20.595
By order of Gríma Wormtongue.

769
01:17:37.904 --> 01:17:40.907
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

770
01:17:43.076 --> 01:17:46.580
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

771
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.268
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

772
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:18.195
He's a herald of woe.

773
01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:22.741
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

774
01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:25.285
Théoden King.

775
01:18:25.994 --> 01:18:28.538
He's not welcome.

776
01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:34.753
Why should I welcome you...

777
01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:38.924
Gandalf Stormcrow?

778
01:18:39.132 --> 01:18:42.427
A just question, my liege.

779
01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:45.430
Late is the hour...

780
01:18:45.639 --> 01:18:49.643
in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

781
01:18:50.393 --> 01:18:52.437
Láthspell I name him.

782
01:18:52.646 --> 01:18:55.523
III news is an ill guest.

783
01:18:55.690 --> 01:19:00.278
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

784
01:19:00.445 --> 01:19:02.364
I have not passed
through fire and death...

785
01:19:02.530 --> 01:19:05.784
to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

786
01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:08.870
His staff.

787
01:19:09.037 --> 01:19:13.166
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

788
01:19:16.503 --> 01:19:18.463
Théoden...

789
01:19:19.005 --> 01:19:21.591
son of Thengel...

790
01:19:23.343 --> 01:19:25.720
too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

791
01:19:28.682 --> 01:19:31.977
I would stay still if I were you.

792
01:19:32.185 --> 01:19:34.229
Hearken to me!

793
01:19:39.693 --> 01:19:41.861
I release you...

794
01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:43.989
from the spell.

795
01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:58.586
You have no power here...

796
01:19:58.837 --> 01:20:02.382
Gandalf the Grey.

797
01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:12.851
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

798
01:20:22.277 --> 01:20:23.820
Wait.

799
01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:29.075
If I go, Théoden dies.

800
01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:31.995
You did not kill me...

801
01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:34.372
you will not kill him.

802
01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.961
Rohan is mine.

803
01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:42.797
Be gone.

804
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.469
I know your face.

805
01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:35.308
Éowyn.

806
01:21:37.602 --> 01:21:38.853
Éowyn.

807
01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:48.321
Gandalf?

808
01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:51.741
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

809
01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.715
Dark have been my dreams of late.

810
01:22:11.845 --> 01:22:15.640
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

811
01:22:15.849 --> 01:22:18.768
if they grasped your sword.

812
01:23:03.897 --> 01:23:05.899
I've only...

813
01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:09.110
ever served you, my lord.

814
01:23:09.277 --> 01:23:14.282
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

815
01:23:15.283 --> 01:23:17.243
Send me not from your sight.

816
01:23:19.537 --> 01:23:22.248
No, my lord! No, my lord.

817
01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:23.666
Let him go.

818
01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:27.587
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

819
01:23:36.721 --> 01:23:39.057
Get out of my way!

820
01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:44.437
Hail, Théoden King!

821
01:24:09.087 --> 01:24:11.631
Where is Théodred?

822
01:24:14.634 --> 01:24:17.136
Where is my son?

823
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:15.000
[Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended]
An evil death has set forth the noble warrior

824
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:22.000
[giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende]
A song shall sing the sorrowing, 

825
01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:29.900
[on Meduselde þæt he ma no wære,]
minstrels in Meduseld, that he is no more

826
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:38.000
[his dryhtne dyrest and mæga deorost.]
to his lord dearest, And of kinsman most beloved

827
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:41.700
[Bealo...]
Evil...

828
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:46.100
Simbelmynë.

829
01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:54.859
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

830
01:25:58.696 --> 01:26:01.658
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

831
01:26:03.785 --> 01:26:07.664
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

832
01:26:08.414 --> 01:26:12.835
The young perish and the old linger.

833
01:26:13.419 --> 01:26:15.546
That I should live...

834
01:26:15.713 --> 01:26:19.092
to see the last days of my house.

835
01:26:20.301 --> 01:26:24.180
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

836
01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:30.603
No parent should have to bury
their child.

837
01:26:47.328 --> 01:26:49.205
He was strong in life.

838
01:26:50.289 --> 01:26:53.876
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

839
01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:12.000
[Westu hál... Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu.]
Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.

840
01:27:38.463 --> 01:27:40.339
They had no warning.

841
01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:42.925
They were unarmed.

842
01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:47.430
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

843
01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:50.308
Rick, cot and tree.

844
01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:52.810
- Where is Mama?
- Shh.

845
01:27:53.686 --> 01:27:57.857
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

846
01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:02.445
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

847
01:28:04.030 --> 01:28:07.033
Ride out and meet him head on.

848
01:28:07.784 --> 01:28:11.287
Draw him away from your women
and children.

849
01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:13.247
You must fight.

850
01:28:13.414 --> 01:28:17.251
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

851
01:28:17.418 --> 01:28:19.045
Éomer is loyal to you.

852
01:28:19.212 --> 01:28:21.923
His men will return
and fight for their king.

853
01:28:22.089 --> 01:28:26.010
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

854
01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:31.891
Éomer cannot help us.

855
01:28:32.517 --> 01:28:34.310
I know what it is you want of me...

856
01:28:34.477 --> 01:28:37.730
but I will not bring further death
to my people.

857
01:28:39.398 --> 01:28:41.108
I will not risk open war.

858
01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:46.739
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

859
01:28:50.952 --> 01:28:52.578
When last I looked...

860
01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:56.666
Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

861
01:29:03.548 --> 01:29:05.800
Then what is the king's decision?

862
01:29:11.389 --> 01:29:12.765
By order of the king...

863
01:29:12.932 --> 01:29:14.350
the city must empty.

864
01:29:15.518 --> 01:29:18.396
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

865
01:29:18.688 --> 01:29:22.567
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

866
01:29:22.775 --> 01:29:24.277
Helm's Deep.

867
01:29:24.443 --> 01:29:27.989
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

868
01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:30.116
Who will defend them if not their king?

869
01:29:30.283 --> 01:29:32.743
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

870
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.745
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

871
01:29:34.912 --> 01:29:38.791
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

872
01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:41.168
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

873
01:29:41.335 --> 01:29:43.504
What they will get is a massacre.

874
01:29:45.047 --> 01:29:47.550
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

875
01:29:48.426 --> 01:29:51.804
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

876
01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:55.099
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

877
01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:58.352
The people of Rohan will need you.

878
01:29:58.728 --> 01:30:01.188
The defenses have to hold.

879
01:30:02.607 --> 01:30:04.358
They will hold.

880
01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:10.656
The Grey Pilgrim.

881
01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:13.451
That's what they used to call me.

882
01:30:13.618 --> 01:30:18.748
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

883
01:30:20.333 --> 01:30:22.543
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

884
01:30:23.085 --> 01:30:26.380
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

885
01:30:27.256 --> 01:30:29.967
At dawn, look to the east.

886
01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:31.677
Go.

887
01:30:58.996 --> 01:31:02.375
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

888
01:31:03.793 --> 01:31:05.878



889
01:31:04.046 --> 01:31:08.746
[Fæste... Stille nú.]
Fast... quiet now.

890
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000



891
01:31:11.258 --> 01:31:17.958
[Fæste... Stille nú.]
Fast... quiet now.

892
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.900



893
01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.400


894
01:31:20.879 --> 01:31:25.617
[Stille...Stille...Stille...]
Quiet... quiet... quiet.

895
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.800


896
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000


897
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:32.399
[Lac is drefed, gefrægon.]
A battle is stirred up, they heard.

898
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.300



899
01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.980
[Hwæt nemnað ðe?]
What is your name?

900
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.000



901
01:31:41.414 --> 01:31:43.457
His name is Brego.

902
01:31:44.959 --> 01:31:46.919
He was my cousin's horse.

903
01:31:47.086 --> 01:31:48.921
Brego.

904
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.100
[Ðin nama is cynglic.]
Your name is kingly. 

905
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.100



906
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.300
[Man le trasta, Brego?]
What troubles you, Brego?


907
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.300


908
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.000
[Man cenich?]
What did you see?

909
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.000



910
01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:06.063
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

911
01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:09.525
but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

912
01:32:10.568 --> 01:32:12.987
You speak as one of their own.

913
01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.241
I was raised in Rivendell...

914
01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:19.035
for a time.

915
01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.373
Turn this fellow free.

916
01:32:24.999 --> 01:32:27.501
He's seen enough of war.

917
01:32:39.263 --> 01:32:42.099
Gandalf the White.

918
01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.643
Gandalf the Fool!

919
01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:50.232
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

920
01:32:51.192 --> 01:32:55.154
There were three
who followed the wizard.

921
01:32:55.571 --> 01:33:00.910
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

922
01:33:01.285 --> 01:33:04.080
You stink of horse.

923
01:33:09.335 --> 01:33:11.212
The Man...

924
01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:17.468
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

925
01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:21.430
One of the Dúnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

926
01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:23.390
His cloth was poor.

927
01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:29.438
And yet he bore a strange ring.

928
01:33:30.523 --> 01:33:34.068
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

929
01:33:34.235 --> 01:33:40.074
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

930
01:33:40.241 --> 01:33:42.159
The Ring of Barahir.

931
01:33:43.119 --> 01:33:46.705
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

932
01:33:46.872 --> 01:33:50.209
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

933
01:33:50.376 --> 01:33:53.129
The line was broken years ago.

934
01:33:54.547 --> 01:33:56.006
It matters not.

935
01:33:56.173 --> 01:33:58.717
The world of Men shall fall.

936
01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:00.761
It will begin at Edoras.

937
01:34:09.979 --> 01:34:11.897
I am ready, Gamling.

938
01:34:12.064 --> 01:34:14.567
Bring my horse.

939
01:34:17.695 --> 01:34:19.071
This is not a defeat.

940
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.700
We will return.

941
01:34:28.164 --> 01:34:30.583
We will return.

942
01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:55.900
You have some skill with a blade.

943
01:35:04.408 --> 01:35:06.493
Women of this country learned long ago:

944
01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.288
those without swords
can still die upon them.

945
01:35:09.455 --> 01:35:11.290
I fear neither death nor pain.

946
01:35:12.541 --> 01:35:14.668
What do you fear, my lady?

947
01:35:18.047 --> 01:35:19.882
A cage.

948
01:35:21.175 --> 01:35:25.012
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

949
01:35:25.179 --> 01:35:29.141
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

950
01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:34.563
You're a daughter of kings...

951
01:35:35.814 --> 01:35:39.151
a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

952
01:35:44.406 --> 01:35:46.951
I do not think that would be your fate.

953
01:36:19.984 --> 01:36:23.028
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.

954
01:36:23.195 --> 01:36:25.322
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

955
01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:28.367
He will expect an attack on the city.

956
01:36:29.702 --> 01:36:32.955
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

957
01:36:33.122 --> 01:36:35.457
the great fortress of Rohan.

958
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:41.046
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

959
01:36:42.506 --> 01:36:44.216
They will be slow.

960
01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:49.013
They will have women and children
with them.

961
01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:55.227
Send out your Warg-riders.

962
01:37:10.034 --> 01:37:12.953
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

963
01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.789
- Why do you do that?
- What?

964
01:37:15.956 --> 01:37:18.500
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

965
01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:20.961
Because.

966
01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:24.631
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

967
01:37:24.798 --> 01:37:27.009
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

968
01:37:27.426 --> 01:37:30.220
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

969
01:37:30.387 --> 01:37:32.639
You have no idea what it did to him...

970
01:37:32.806 --> 01:37:35.309
what it's still doing to him.

971
01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:39.605
I want to help him, Sam.

972
01:37:39.772 --> 01:37:41.065
Why?

973
01:37:46.362 --> 01:37:49.490
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

974
01:37:53.786 --> 01:37:55.662
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

975
01:37:55.829 --> 01:37:58.582
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

976
01:38:05.506 --> 01:38:09.718
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

977
01:38:10.552 --> 01:38:11.678
I do.

978
01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:15.599
It's the Ring.

979
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.726
You can't take your eyes off it.

980
01:38:18.435 --> 01:38:20.437
I've seen you.

981
01:38:20.896 --> 01:38:24.733
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

982
01:38:26.485 --> 01:38:28.737
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

983
01:38:28.904 --> 01:38:31.615
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

984
01:38:31.824 --> 01:38:34.701
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

985
01:38:34.868 --> 01:38:36.620
Mine! My own!

986
01:38:37.454 --> 01:38:39.581
Can't you hear yourself?

987
01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:41.417
Don't you know who you sound like?

988
01:38:51.677 --> 01:38:53.804
We wants it.

989
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:56.682
We needs it.

990
01:38:56.849 --> 01:39:01.645
Must have the precious.

991
01:39:01.854 --> 01:39:05.274
They stole it from us.

992
01:39:05.441 --> 01:39:08.819
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

993
01:39:08.986 --> 01:39:12.865
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

994
01:39:13.031 --> 01:39:16.326
No. Not master.

995
01:39:16.493 --> 01:39:20.330
Yes, precious. False.

996
01:39:20.497 --> 01:39:25.002
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

997
01:39:26.128 --> 01:39:28.589
Master's my friend.

998
01:39:28.755 --> 01:39:33.886
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

999
01:39:35.095 --> 01:39:37.598
Not listening. I'm not listening.

1000
01:39:37.764 --> 01:39:41.768
You're a liar and a thief.

1001
01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:43.979
No.

1002
01:39:44.897 --> 01:39:47.774
Murderer.

1003
01:39:50.235 --> 01:39:51.278
Go away.

1004
01:39:51.445 --> 01:39:53.822
Go away?

1005
01:39:55.824 --> 01:40:01.205
I hate you.

1006
01:40:01.497 --> 01:40:04.791
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

1007
01:40:04.958 --> 01:40:06.793
I saved us.

1008
01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.507
It was me. We survived because of me.

1009
01:40:12.716 --> 01:40:16.303
Not anymore.

1010
01:40:17.638 --> 01:40:19.223
What did you say?

1011
01:40:21.266 --> 01:40:25.103
Master looks after us now.

1012
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:28.774
We don't need you.

1013
01:40:29.483 --> 01:40:31.068
What?

1014
01:40:31.235 --> 01:40:32.986
Leave now...

1015
01:40:33.153 --> 01:40:36.949
and never come back.

1016
01:40:37.115 --> 01:40:38.158
No.

1017
01:40:38.659 --> 01:40:42.871
Leave now and never come back.

1018
01:40:45.457 --> 01:40:51.380
Leave now and never come back!

1019
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:06.061
We told him to go away.

1020
01:41:06.228 --> 01:41:09.189
And away he goes, precious.

1021
01:41:09.356 --> 01:41:11.358
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1022
01:41:11.525 --> 01:41:13.318
Sméagol is free!

1023
01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.741
Look.

1024
01:41:19.908 --> 01:41:24.413
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

1025
01:41:33.922 --> 01:41:35.340
They are young.

1026
01:41:35.507 --> 01:41:38.051
They are tender. They are nice.

1027
01:41:38.218 --> 01:41:41.763
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1028
01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:46.059
You'll make him sick, you will...

1029
01:41:47.269 --> 01:41:49.521
behaving like that.

1030
01:41:51.857 --> 01:41:54.651
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1031
01:41:58.822 --> 01:42:00.407
What's it doing?

1032
01:42:01.116 --> 01:42:03.785
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1033
01:42:03.952 --> 01:42:06.163
It ruins it.

1034
01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:09.958
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1035
01:42:14.087 --> 01:42:16.673
What we need is a few good taters.

1036
01:42:17.549 --> 01:42:20.594
What's taters, precious?

1037
01:42:20.761 --> 01:42:22.512
What's taters? Eh?

1038
01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:24.389
Po-ta-toes.

1039
01:42:24.723 --> 01:42:27.976
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1040
01:42:29.478 --> 01:42:34.983
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1041
01:42:36.276 --> 01:42:38.195
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1042
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.697
Oh, yes, we could.

1043
01:42:40.864 --> 01:42:44.368
Spoil a nice fish.

1044
01:42:45.661 --> 01:42:48.288
Give it to us raw...

1045
01:42:48.455 --> 01:42:51.500
and wriggling.

1046
01:42:51.667 --> 01:42:54.795
You keep nasty chips.

1047
01:42:55.712 --> 01:42:57.798
You're hopeless.

1048
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:11.812
Mr. Frodo?

1049
01:43:29.705 --> 01:43:32.374
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1050
01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:35.001
Servants of Sauron.

1051
01:43:35.794 --> 01:43:38.004
They are called to Mordor.

1052
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:41.216
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1053
01:43:41.383 --> 01:43:44.553
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1054
01:43:46.138 --> 01:43:49.766
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1055
01:43:49.933 --> 01:43:55.147
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1056
01:43:55.397 --> 01:43:57.232
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1057
01:43:58.650 --> 01:43:59.860
Mr. Frodo.

1058
01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:01.987
Look.

1059
01:44:05.657 --> 01:44:07.951
It's an oliphaunt.

1060
01:44:16.168 --> 01:44:19.171
No one at home will believe this.

1061
01:44:30.307 --> 01:44:32.184
Sméagol?

1062
01:45:12.516 --> 01:45:15.018
We've lingered here too long.

1063
01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:19.356
Come on, Sam.

1064
01:45:31.409 --> 01:45:32.661
No!

1065
01:45:32.828 --> 01:45:35.497
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1066
01:45:37.249 --> 01:45:42.337
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1067
01:45:42.504 --> 01:45:45.382
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1068
01:45:46.758 --> 01:45:50.136
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1069
01:45:50.303 --> 01:45:52.389
The enemy?

1070
01:45:54.432 --> 01:45:57.936
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1071
01:46:00.397 --> 01:46:02.524
You wonder what his name is...

1072
01:46:04.025 --> 01:46:06.278
where he came from.

1073
01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.699
And if he was really evil at heart.

1074
01:46:12.367 --> 01:46:15.829
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1075
01:46:17.414 --> 01:46:19.916
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1076
01:46:22.085 --> 01:46:23.628
in peace.

1077
01:46:27.173 --> 01:46:30.218
War will make corpses of us all.

1078
01:46:30.385 --> 01:46:32.429
Bind their hands.

1079
01:46:39.311 --> 01:46:42.063
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

1080
01:46:42.272 --> 01:46:45.900
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1081
01:46:46.067 --> 01:46:49.279
that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

1082
01:46:49.612 --> 01:46:51.531
It's the beards.

1083
01:46:51.781 --> 01:46:53.867
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1084
01:46:54.034 --> 01:46:56.911
that there are no Dwarf women...

1085
01:46:57.078 --> 01:47:01.333
and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1086
01:47:03.001 --> 01:47:04.401
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1087
01:47:10.967 --> 01:47:13.303
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1088
01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:15.680
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1089
01:47:17.599 --> 01:47:21.436
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1090
01:47:21.728 --> 01:47:24.481
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1091
01:47:24.647 --> 01:47:26.941
Cut down by Orcs.

1092
01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:30.111
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1093
01:47:30.737 --> 01:47:35.450
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1094
01:47:35.617 --> 01:47:40.163
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1095
01:47:50.131 --> 01:47:52.509
Gimli.

1096
01:47:52.675 --> 01:47:54.761
No, I couldn't.

1097
01:47:54.928 --> 01:47:56.763
I really couldn't.

1098
01:48:01.267 --> 01:48:02.894
I made some stew.

1099
01:48:03.061 --> 01:48:06.356
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1100
01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:16.199
Thank you.

1101
01:48:36.719 --> 01:48:39.264
- It's good.
- Really?

1102
01:48:43.226 --> 01:48:46.604
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1103
01:48:47.897 --> 01:48:51.985
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1104
01:48:52.402 --> 01:48:54.904
But he must be mistaken.

1105
01:48:55.113 --> 01:48:59.534
King Théoden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1106
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.913
Then you must be at least 60.

1107
01:49:05.957 --> 01:49:07.542
Seventy?

1108
01:49:07.959 --> 01:49:09.627
But you cannot be 80!

1109
01:49:12.964 --> 01:49:14.340
Eighty-seven.

1110
01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:19.554
You are one of the Dúnedain.

1111
01:49:20.597 --> 01:49:23.725
A descendant of Númenor,
blessed with long life.

1112
01:49:24.934 --> 01:49:27.562
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1113
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:29.981
There are few of us left.

1114
01:49:30.148 --> 01:49:32.984
The Northern Kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1115
01:49:33.735 --> 01:49:37.155
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1116
01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:55.965
The light of the Evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1117
01:49:56.716 --> 01:50:00.178
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1118
01:50:01.971 --> 01:50:04.390
Like my heart.

1119
01:50:05.808 --> 01:50:08.520
Go to sleep.

1120
01:50:08.686 --> 01:50:11.189
I am asleep.

1121
01:50:17.654 --> 01:50:19.614
This is a dream.

1122
01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:25.036
Then it is a good dream.

1123
01:50:37.048 --> 01:50:39.133
Sleep.

1124
01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:05.732
[Minlû pedich nin...]
You told me once...

1125
01:51:03.850 --> 01:51:05.732


1126
01:51:07.844 --> 01:51:10.055
[I aur hen telitha.]
this day would come.

1127
01:51:07.844 --> 01:51:10.055

1128
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:13.950
[Ú I vethed... nâ I onnad.]
This is not the end... it is the beginning.

1129
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:13.950

1130
01:51:14.168 --> 01:51:16.382
[Boe bedich go Frodo.]
You must go with Frodo.

1131
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:19.450


1132
01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:19.450
[Han bâd lîn.]
This is your path.

1133
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:32.050
[Dolen I vâd o nin.]
My path is hidden from me.

1134
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:32.050

1135
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:35.650
[Si peliannen I vâd na dail lîn.]
It is already laid before your feet.

1136
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:35.650

1137
01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:39.450
[Si boe ú-dhannathach.]
You cannot falter now.

1138
01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:39.450



1139
01:51:42.484 --> 01:51:43.984
Arwen...

1140
01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:48.350
[Ae ú-esteliach nad...]
If you trust nothing else...

1141
01:51:45.850 --> 01:51:48.350

1142
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:51.579
[estelio han...]
Trust this...

1143
01:51:49.150 --> 01:51:51.579

1144
01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:54.938
[estelio ammen.]
Trust us.

1145
01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:54.938

1146
01:52:33.498 --> 01:52:35.333
Where is she?

1147
01:52:36.501 --> 01:52:38.920
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1148
01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:45.009
Our time here is ending.

1149
01:52:45.677 --> 01:52:48.262
Arwen's time is ending.

1150
01:52:48.971 --> 01:52:50.264
Let her go.

1151
01:52:50.431 --> 01:52:52.433
Let her take the ship into the west.

1152
01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:55.687
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

1153
01:52:55.853 --> 01:52:57.647
There it will be ever green.

1154
01:52:59.148 --> 01:53:01.526
But never more than a memory.

1155
01:53:02.777 --> 01:53:05.822
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1156
01:53:06.030 --> 01:53:09.659
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1157
01:53:09.826 --> 01:53:12.161
She belongs with her people.

1158
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.781
[Nach gwannatha sin?]
Is this how you would take your leave?

1159
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.781

1160
01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:31.168
[Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?]
Did you think you could slip away at first light - unnoticed?

1161
01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:31.168


1162
01:53:33.574 --> 01:53:35.769
[Ú-ethelithon.]
I will not be coming back.

1163
01:53:33.574 --> 01:53:35.769

1164
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:38.449

1165
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:40.300
[Estelio guru lîn ne dagor... Ethelithach]
You underestimate your skill in battle... You will come back.'

1166
01:53:40.301 --> 01:53:40.449

1167
01:53:40.450 --> 01:53:42.724
[Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.]
It is not of death in battle that I speak.

1168
01:53:40.450 --> 01:53:42.724

1169
01:53:42.734 --> 01:53:45.040
[O man pedich?]
What do you speak of?

01:53:42.734 --> 01:53:45.040

1171
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:53.789
[Edra le men, men na guil edwen...]
You have a chance for another life...

1172
01:53:49.850 --> 01:53:53.789

1173
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:59.050
[haer o auth... a nîr... a naeth.]
away from war... grief... despair.

1174
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:59.050

1175
01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.295
Why are you saying this?

1176
01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:07.049
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1177
01:54:08.509 --> 01:54:11.179
It was a dream, Arwen.

1178
01:54:11.596 --> 01:54:12.972
Nothing more.

1179
01:54:14.348 --> 01:54:17.560
I don't believe you.

1180
01:54:26.569 --> 01:54:28.404
This belongs to you.

1181
01:54:31.157 --> 01:54:32.742
It was a gift.

1182
01:54:35.411 --> 01:54:36.913
Keep it.

1183
01:54:39.415 --> 01:54:40.625
My lord?

1184
01:54:43.419 --> 01:54:48.007
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1185
01:55:11.447 --> 01:55:12.949
What is it?

1186
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:16.494
- Háma?
- I'm not sure.

1187
01:55:33.052 --> 01:55:35.137
Wargs!

1188
01:55:47.650 --> 01:55:49.318
A scout!

1189
01:55:55.658 --> 01:55:58.160
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1190
01:55:59.495 --> 01:56:01.706
Get them out of here!

1191
01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:08.504
All riders to the head of the column.

1192
01:56:09.171 --> 01:56:11.173
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1193
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:13.092
Come on!

1194
01:56:24.896 --> 01:56:27.356
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1195
01:56:27.523 --> 01:56:29.025
- I can fight.
- No!

1196
01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:33.779
You must do this, for me.

1197
01:56:35.781 --> 01:56:37.366
Follow me! Hyah!

1198
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:45.207
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1199
01:56:45.374 --> 01:56:48.044
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1200
01:58:00.282 --> 01:58:02.576
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1201
01:58:05.371 --> 01:58:06.956
That one counts as mine!

1202
01:58:23.639 --> 01:58:25.266
Stinking creature.

1203
01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:54.396
Aragorn!

1204
01:59:59.110 --> 02:00:00.569
Aragorn?

1205
02:00:14.583 --> 02:00:17.503
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1206
02:00:17.670 --> 02:00:19.088
He's...

1207
02:00:19.672 --> 02:00:21.257
dead.

1208
02:00:21.924 --> 02:00:24.802
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1209
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:29.723
You lie.

1210
02:01:03.632 --> 02:01:05.259
Get the wounded on horses.

1211
02:01:06.552 --> 02:01:09.722
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1212
02:01:10.139 --> 02:01:12.266
Leave the dead.

1213
02:01:19.648 --> 02:01:21.150
Come.

1214
02:01:31.327 --> 02:01:32.953
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1215
02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:35.998
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1216
02:01:38.542 --> 02:01:40.377
We're safe!

1217
02:01:41.879 --> 02:01:44.757
We're safe, my lady.

1218
02:01:44.924 --> 02:01:46.133
Thank you.

1219
02:02:30.469 --> 02:02:31.887
- Mama!
- Éothain!

1220
02:02:32.054 --> 02:02:33.597
Freda!

1221
02:02:39.353 --> 02:02:42.189
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1222
02:02:46.026 --> 02:02:47.361
Take it to the caves.

1223
02:02:47.528 --> 02:02:50.364
Make way for the king.

1224
02:02:52.241 --> 02:02:55.202
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

1225
02:03:03.085 --> 02:03:06.839
So few. So few of you have returned.

1226
02:03:09.591 --> 02:03:11.885
Our people are safe.

1227
02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:15.764
We have paid for it with many lives.

1228
02:03:16.598 --> 02:03:18.142
My lady.

1229
02:03:21.854 --> 02:03:24.106
Lord Aragorn...

1230
02:03:24.273 --> 02:03:25.524
where is he?

1231
02:03:27.526 --> 02:03:29.069
He fell.

1232
02:03:51.759 --> 02:03:54.720
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1233
02:03:54.887 --> 02:03:57.806
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1234
02:03:58.057 --> 02:04:01.143
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1235
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:03.937
Get them into the caves.

1236
02:04:04.813 --> 02:04:09.651
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1237
02:04:11.695 --> 02:04:15.115
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1238
02:04:15.282 --> 02:04:17.618
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1239
02:04:17.785 --> 02:04:20.871
but for a small culvert
at its base...

1240
02:04:21.038 --> 02:04:23.832
which is little more than a drain.

1241
02:04:26.668 --> 02:04:30.839
How? How can fire undo stone?

1242
02:04:31.006 --> 02:04:35.552
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1243
02:04:39.181 --> 02:04:43.185
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

1244
02:04:43.352 --> 02:04:46.855
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1245
02:04:47.022 --> 02:04:49.608
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1246
02:04:49.775 --> 02:04:51.193
Tens of thousands.

1247
02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.447
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1248
02:05:07.376 --> 02:05:10.462
A new power is rising.

1249
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:13.632
Its victory is at hand.

1250
02:05:19.304 --> 02:05:21.390
This night...

1251
02:05:21.807 --> 02:05:26.145
the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1252
02:05:26.311 --> 02:05:29.648
March to Helm's Deep!

1253
02:05:29.815 --> 02:05:33.318
Leave none alive!

1254
02:05:35.821 --> 02:05:38.323
To war!

1255
02:05:42.244 --> 02:05:46.707
There will be no dawn for Men.

1256
02:06:03.891 --> 02:06:05.934
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1257
02:06:06.101 --> 02:06:09.271
There is always smoke rising...

1258
02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:13.317
from Isengard these days.

1259
02:06:13.567 --> 02:06:15.152
Isengard?

1260
02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:17.237
There was a time...

1261
02:06:17.571 --> 02:06:21.116
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1262
02:06:21.283 --> 02:06:24.620
But now he has a mind of metal...

1263
02:06:25.287 --> 02:06:27.748
and wheels.

1264
02:06:28.499 --> 02:06:33.003
He no longer cares for growing things.

1265
02:06:33.170 --> 02:06:34.963
What is it?

1266
02:06:39.968 --> 02:06:42.179
It's Saruman's army.

1267
02:06:42.346 --> 02:06:43.931
The war has started.

1268
02:07:22.219 --> 02:07:26.598
May the grace of the Valar
protect you.

1269
02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.757
Brego.

1270
02:08:26.867 --> 02:08:28.035
Arwen.

1271
02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:31.150
[Tollen I lû.]
It is time.

1272
02:08:29.150 --> 02:08:31.150

1273
02:08:33.150 --> 02:08:36.950
[I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.]
The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now, before it is too late.

1274
02:08:33.150 --> 02:08:36.950

1275
02:08:37.919 --> 02:08:39.713
I have made my choice.

1276
02:08:46.136 --> 02:08:49.014
He is not coming back.

1277
02:08:50.432 --> 02:08:53.769
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1278
02:08:54.686 --> 02:08:57.689
There is still hope.

1279
02:09:01.818 --> 02:09:05.614
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1280
02:09:08.992 --> 02:09:11.953
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king...

1281
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.623
and all that you hope for
comes true...

1282
02:09:14.790 --> 02:09:19.503
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1283
02:09:19.795 --> 02:09:22.798
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1284
02:09:22.964 --> 02:09:25.884
Aragorn will die.

1285
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:31.306
And there will be no comfort
for you...

1286
02:09:31.473 --> 02:09:35.686
no comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1287
02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:41.233
He will come to death...

1288
02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.985
an image of the splendor
of the kings of Men...

1289
02:09:44.152 --> 02:09:48.824
in glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1290
02:09:57.916 --> 02:10:01.878
But you, my daughter...

1291
02:10:02.671 --> 02:10:07.718
you will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

1292
02:10:07.884 --> 02:10:11.972
as nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1293
02:10:14.349 --> 02:10:16.768
Here you will dwell...

1294
02:10:16.935 --> 02:10:21.857
bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

1295
02:10:23.567 --> 02:10:25.569
until all the world is changed...

1296
02:10:25.736 --> 02:10:30.240
and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1297
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:39.958
Arwen.

1298
02:10:46.590 --> 02:10:48.884
There is nothing for you here...

1299
02:10:49.551 --> 02:10:51.636
only death.

1300
02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:14.850
[Ah im, ú-'erin veleth lîn?]
Do I not also have your love?

02:11:12.150 --> 02:11:14.850

1302
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:19.250
[Gerich veleth nîn, ada.]
You have my love, father.

1303
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:19.250

1304
02:12:10.050 --> 02:12:13.220
[I amar prestar aen,]
The world is changed,

1305
02:12:10.050 --> 02:12:13.220



1306
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.700
[han mathon ne nen,]
I feel it in the water,


1307
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.700


1308
02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:18.400
[han mathon ne chae,]
I feel it in the earth,


1309
02:12:16.150 --> 02:12:18.400


1310
02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:22.050
[a han noston ned 'wilith.]
and I smell it in the air.

1311
02:12:20.050 --> 02:12:22.050



1312
02:12:25.063 --> 02:12:28.692
The power of the enemy is growing.

1313
02:12:28.859 --> 02:12:31.486
Sauron will use his puppet,
Saruman...

1314
02:12:31.653 --> 02:12:35.115
to destroy the people of Rohan.

1315
02:12:37.158 --> 02:12:40.829
Isengard has been unleashed.

1316
02:12:45.125 --> 02:12:48.503
The Eye of Sauron now turns
to Gondor...

1317
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:52.632
the last free kingdom of Men.

1318
02:12:52.799 --> 02:12:57.178
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1319
02:13:00.891 --> 02:13:04.019
He senses the Ring is close.

1320
02:13:04.185 --> 02:13:07.647
The strength of the Ring-bearer
is failing.

1321
02:13:07.814 --> 02:13:11.860
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

1322
02:13:13.403 --> 02:13:17.282
the quest will claim his life.

1323
02:13:17.449 --> 02:13:19.618
You know this.

1324
02:13:20.201 --> 02:13:23.038
You have foreseen it.

1325
02:13:25.165 --> 02:13:28.627
It is the risk we all took.

1326
02:13:33.006 --> 02:13:37.218
In the gathering dark, the will
of the Ring grows strong.

1327
02:13:38.386 --> 02:13:42.807
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

1328
02:13:42.974 --> 02:13:48.438
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1329
02:13:48.647 --> 02:13:52.233
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1330
02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.488
take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1331
02:13:58.907 --> 02:14:00.742
It is close now.

1332
02:14:00.909 --> 02:14:05.163
So close to achieving its goal.

1333
02:14:08.249 --> 02:14:11.920
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1334
02:14:12.087 --> 02:14:16.216
even unto the ending
of the world.

1335
02:14:18.051 --> 02:14:19.886
The time of the Elves...

1336
02:14:20.095 --> 02:14:22.013
is over.

1337
02:14:22.847 --> 02:14:26.434
Do we leave Middle-earth
to its fate?

1338
02:14:28.395 --> 02:14:31.648
Do we let them stand alone?

1339
02:14:36.277 --> 02:14:37.612
What news?

1340
02:14:37.779 --> 02:14:40.615
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1341
02:14:40.782 --> 02:14:43.618
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

1342
02:14:43.785 --> 02:14:47.831
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1343
02:14:47.998 --> 02:14:50.417
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1344
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:52.877
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

1345
02:14:53.044 --> 02:14:56.464
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1346
02:14:57.549 --> 02:15:01.136
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1347
02:15:01.302 --> 02:15:04.347
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1348
02:15:06.474 --> 02:15:08.643
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1349
02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:11.521
Sauron from Mordor.

1350
02:15:12.814 --> 02:15:16.067
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

1351
02:15:16.234 --> 02:15:17.944
Gondor is weak.

1352
02:15:18.111 --> 02:15:21.239
Sauron will strike us soon.

1353
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:23.825
And he will strike hard.

1354
02:15:24.284 --> 02:15:28.371
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1355
02:15:42.302 --> 02:15:44.512
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1356
02:15:44.679 --> 02:15:47.432
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1357
02:15:47.599 --> 02:15:49.851
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1358
02:15:56.733 --> 02:15:58.485
Speak.

1359
02:15:59.569 --> 02:16:02.197
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1360
02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:05.533
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1361
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:07.494
Your bodyguard?

1362
02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:09.454
His gardener.

1363
02:16:10.038 --> 02:16:12.040
And where is your skulking friend?

1364
02:16:13.541 --> 02:16:15.877
That gangrel creature.

1365
02:16:16.211 --> 02:16:18.171
He had an ill-favored look.

1366
02:16:19.881 --> 02:16:21.800
There was no other.

1367
02:16:25.887 --> 02:16:28.223
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

1368
02:16:31.559 --> 02:16:34.646
One we lost in Moria...

1369
02:16:35.730 --> 02:16:37.232
two were my kin...

1370
02:16:37.398 --> 02:16:41.152
a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

1371
02:16:41.319 --> 02:16:45.240
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

1372
02:16:50.245 --> 02:16:51.996
You're a friend of Boromir?

1373
02:16:54.415 --> 02:16:55.917
Yes.

1374
02:16:57.001 --> 02:16:58.086
For my part.

1375
02:17:04.592 --> 02:17:07.554
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1376
02:17:09.597 --> 02:17:11.057
Dead?

1377
02:17:11.224 --> 02:17:13.268
How? When?

1378
02:17:13.518 --> 02:17:16.187
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1379
02:17:16.479 --> 02:17:20.316
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1380
02:17:23.069 --> 02:17:29.534
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1381
02:17:29.742 --> 02:17:32.829
It was cloven in two.

1382
02:17:34.497 --> 02:17:37.917
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1383
02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:41.754
He was my brother.

1384
02:18:30.637 --> 02:18:33.681
Boromir!

1385
02:18:34.182 --> 02:18:36.059
Boromir!

1386
02:18:40.313 --> 02:18:44.067
This city was once the jewel
of our kingdom.

1387
02:18:44.234 --> 02:18:47.904
A place of light and beauty and music.

1388
02:18:48.071 --> 02:18:50.406
And so it shall be once more!

1389
02:18:52.951 --> 02:18:55.620
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1390
02:18:55.787 --> 02:19:00.166
never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1391
02:19:03.962 --> 02:19:09.634
This city of Osgiliath
has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1392
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:14.973
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1393
02:19:23.690 --> 02:19:26.442
Good speech. Nice and short.

1394
02:19:26.609 --> 02:19:29.529
Leaves more time for drinking!

1395
02:19:29.821 --> 02:19:34.075
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1396
02:19:37.537 --> 02:19:39.706
Remember today, little brother.

1397
02:19:39.872 --> 02:19:42.875
Today, life is good.

1398
02:19:47.046 --> 02:19:48.631
What?

1399
02:19:49.007 --> 02:19:50.466
He's here.

1400
02:19:53.678 --> 02:19:55.950
Not one moment of peace,
can he not give us that?

1401
02:19:55.975 --> 02:19:56.747
Where is he?

1402
02:19:56.889 --> 02:20:00.351
Where is Gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1403
02:20:00.893 --> 02:20:02.603
Father!

1404
02:20:07.442 --> 02:20:09.819
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1405
02:20:09.986 --> 02:20:13.406
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1406
02:20:14.866 --> 02:20:17.785
But for Faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1407
02:20:18.578 --> 02:20:20.872
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1408
02:20:21.039 --> 02:20:23.082
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1409
02:20:23.249 --> 02:20:24.959
Oh, too few.

1410
02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:27.837
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1411
02:20:30.048 --> 02:20:33.134
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1412
02:20:33.301 --> 02:20:35.553
That is not my intent.

1413
02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:39.474
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1414
02:20:42.852 --> 02:20:45.772
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1415
02:20:45.938 --> 02:20:48.691
I know his uses, and they are few.

1416
02:20:48.858 --> 02:20:52.487
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1417
02:20:53.654 --> 02:20:56.074
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1418
02:20:56.240 --> 02:20:59.118
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1419
02:20:59.285 --> 02:21:03.081
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1420
02:21:05.291 --> 02:21:07.585
The One Ring.

1421
02:21:10.338 --> 02:21:15.009
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1422
02:21:15.176 --> 02:21:18.805
Everyone will try to claim it,
Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1423
02:21:18.971 --> 02:21:23.101
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1424
02:21:24.894 --> 02:21:27.563
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1425
02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:31.442
Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser Men.

1426
02:21:31.609 --> 02:21:35.571
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1427
02:21:35.738 --> 02:21:41.035
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1428
02:21:41.202 --> 02:21:46.290
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1429
02:21:46.457 --> 02:21:47.959
He will return.

1430
02:21:48.126 --> 02:21:51.879
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1431
02:21:52.046 --> 02:21:54.590
You must go.

1432
02:21:55.758 --> 02:21:57.885
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1433
02:21:58.719 --> 02:22:04.225
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell.

1434
02:22:04.392 --> 02:22:08.062
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1435
02:22:08.229 --> 02:22:11.232
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1436
02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.318
Oh, I see.

1437
02:22:14.485 --> 02:22:18.698
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.

1438
02:22:19.115 --> 02:22:21.117
I think not.

1439
02:22:21.284 --> 02:22:24.162
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1440
02:22:24.328 --> 02:22:27.248
The one who will not fail me.

1441
02:22:44.390 --> 02:22:47.560
Remember today, little brother.

1442
02:23:05.912 --> 02:23:07.914
Captain Faramir!

1443
02:23:09.165 --> 02:23:11.292
We found the third one.

1444
02:23:22.803 --> 02:23:24.805
You must come with me. Now.

1445
02:23:36.025 --> 02:23:37.151
Down there.

1446
02:23:52.041 --> 02:23:54.919
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

1447
02:24:05.513 --> 02:24:07.014
They wait for my command.

1448
02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:13.604
Shall I shoot?

1449
02:24:14.855 --> 02:24:17.858
The rock and pool
Is nice and cool

1450
02:24:18.025 --> 02:24:19.860
So juicy sweet

1451
02:24:20.528 --> 02:24:23.489
Our only wish To catch a fish

1452
02:24:23.656 --> 02:24:26.367
So juicy sweet

1453
02:24:33.374 --> 02:24:34.750
Wait.

1454
02:24:36.252 --> 02:24:39.088
This creature is bound to me.

1455
02:24:39.714 --> 02:24:41.632
And I to him.

1456
02:24:44.885 --> 02:24:46.220
He is our guide.

1457
02:24:50.933 --> 02:24:52.351
Please...

1458
02:24:52.518 --> 02:24:54.395
let me go down to him.

1459
02:25:05.656 --> 02:25:07.325
Sméagol.

1460
02:25:08.326 --> 02:25:10.578
Master is here.

1461
02:25:11.746 --> 02:25:12.913
Come, Sméagol.

1462
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:18.419
Trust master. Come.

1463
02:25:21.589 --> 02:25:25.426
We must go now?

1464
02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:29.221
Sméagol, you must trust master.

1465
02:25:29.388 --> 02:25:30.765
Follow me. Come on.

1466
02:25:31.974 --> 02:25:33.601
Come.

1467
02:25:36.103 --> 02:25:37.271
Come, Sméagol.

1468
02:25:37.772 --> 02:25:39.857
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1469
02:25:40.358 --> 02:25:41.901
Come on.

1470
02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:47.948
Don't hurt him!

1471
02:25:48.115 --> 02:25:50.868
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1472
02:25:51.035 --> 02:25:52.328
Master!

1473
02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.897
That's enough.

1474
02:26:23.526 --> 02:26:25.695
Where are you leading them?

1475
02:26:27.488 --> 02:26:29.156
Answer me.

1476
02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:33.202
Sméagol.

1477
02:26:36.664 --> 02:26:41.419
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1478
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:45.297
Cruel Men hurts us.

1479
02:26:45.464 --> 02:26:48.467
Master tricksed us.

1480
02:26:48.634 --> 02:26:52.179
Of course he did.

1481
02:26:52.555 --> 02:26:56.267
I told you he was tricksy.

1482
02:26:56.434 --> 02:26:59.478
I told you he was false.

1483
02:26:59.645 --> 02:27:02.356
Master is our friend.

1484
02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:04.859
Our friend.

1485
02:27:05.025 --> 02:27:07.194
Master betrayed us.

1486
02:27:07.361 --> 02:27:10.364
No. Not its business.

1487
02:27:11.449 --> 02:27:13.868
Leave us alone!

1488
02:27:14.034 --> 02:27:16.454
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1489
02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:18.914
They stole it from us!

1490
02:27:19.081 --> 02:27:20.541
No. No.

1491
02:27:21.083 --> 02:27:22.710
What did they steal?

1492
02:27:24.879 --> 02:27:30.217
My precious!

1493
02:27:33.888 --> 02:27:35.556
We have to get out of here.

1494
02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:38.100
You go. Go, now.

1495
02:27:40.728 --> 02:27:42.563
You can do it.

1496
02:27:44.023 --> 02:27:45.483
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1497
02:27:45.649 --> 02:27:47.443
Just this once.

1498
02:27:47.610 --> 02:27:49.403
Put it on.

1499
02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:51.864
Disappear.

1500
02:27:52.907 --> 02:27:53.991
I can't.

1501
02:27:57.077 --> 02:27:59.288
You were right, Sam.

1502
02:28:00.748 --> 02:28:03.250
You tried to tell me but...

1503
02:28:07.922 --> 02:28:10.090
I'm sorry.

1504
02:28:14.637 --> 02:28:17.515
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1505
02:28:18.933 --> 02:28:20.601
If I put it on...

1506
02:28:20.768 --> 02:28:23.103
he'll find me.

1507
02:28:24.772 --> 02:28:26.732
He'll see.

1508
02:28:27.942 --> 02:28:29.944
Mr. Frodo...

1509
02:28:34.865 --> 02:28:39.119
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1510
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:44.333
Here in the Wild I have you...

1511
02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:46.418
two Halflings...

1512
02:28:46.585 --> 02:28:49.755
and a host of men at my call.

1513
02:28:53.050 --> 02:28:56.554
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1514
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:09.984
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor...

1515
02:29:11.569 --> 02:29:14.613
to show his quality.

1516
02:29:35.718 --> 02:29:37.344
No!

1517
02:29:40.514 --> 02:29:41.849
Stop it!

1518
02:29:42.016 --> 02:29:43.058
Leave him alone.

1519
02:29:44.393 --> 02:29:46.896
Don't you understand?

1520
02:29:48.188 --> 02:29:50.107
He's got to destroy it!

1521
02:29:50.274 --> 02:29:53.527
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1522
02:29:53.694 --> 02:29:55.362
To the Mountain of Fire!

1523
02:29:56.405 --> 02:29:59.533
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1524
02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:02.703
Please. It's such a burden.

1525
02:30:04.872 --> 02:30:06.957
Will you not help him?

1526
02:30:08.292 --> 02:30:10.210
Captain?

1527
02:30:10.878 --> 02:30:13.088
Prepare to leave.

1528
02:30:18.052 --> 02:30:20.471
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1529
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:24.950
[Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.]
Well done, Brego, my friend.

1530
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:24.950



1531
02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:36.130
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1532
02:31:36.296 --> 02:31:39.341
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1533
02:31:39.508 --> 02:31:43.303
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1534
02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:47.474
and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1535
02:31:48.142 --> 02:31:49.643
Bless you, laddie.

1536
02:31:50.227 --> 02:31:51.979
Gimli, where is the king?

1537
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:02.200
[Le abdollen.]
You're late.

1538
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:02.200

1539
02:32:05.743 --> 02:32:07.077
You look terrible.

1540
02:32:34.146 --> 02:32:36.146
[Hannon le.]
Thank you.

1541
02:32:34.146 --> 02:32:36.146



1542
02:32:48.827 --> 02:32:50.871
A great host, you say?

1543
02:32:51.038 --> 02:32:52.498
All Isengard is emptied.

1544
02:32:52.664 --> 02:32:53.707
How many?

1545
02:32:54.374 --> 02:32:57.377
Ten thousand strong at least.

1546
02:32:58.921 --> 02:33:00.380
Ten thousand?

1547
02:33:00.798 --> 02:33:03.300
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1548
02:33:05.969 --> 02:33:08.097
to destroy the world of Men.

1549
02:33:10.599 --> 02:33:12.601
They will be here by nightfall.

1550
02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:19.733
Let them come!

1551
02:33:21.235 --> 02:33:24.029
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1552
02:33:24.196 --> 02:33:27.324
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1553
02:33:35.582 --> 02:33:38.502
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1554
02:33:38.669 --> 02:33:41.088
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall...

1555
02:33:41.255 --> 02:33:44.007
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1556
02:33:44.174 --> 02:33:46.593
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1557
02:33:47.177 --> 02:33:49.388
These are Uruk-hai.

1558
02:33:49.555 --> 02:33:52.975
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1559
02:33:54.601 --> 02:33:58.272
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1560
02:33:58.438 --> 02:34:02.067
I know how to defend my own keep.

1561
02:34:08.657 --> 02:34:12.077
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1562
02:34:12.244 --> 02:34:17.457
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1563
02:34:17.666 --> 02:34:20.335
Crops can be resown...

1564
02:34:20.502 --> 02:34:23.505
homes rebuilt.

1565
02:34:24.131 --> 02:34:26.675
Within these walls...

1566
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:28.552
we will outlast them.

1567
02:34:28.719 --> 02:34:31.138
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1568
02:34:31.305 --> 02:34:32.848
They come to destroy its people...

1569
02:34:33.015 --> 02:34:35.517
down to the last child.

1570
02:34:36.393 --> 02:34:38.645
What would you have me do?

1571
02:34:38.812 --> 02:34:40.564
Look at my men.

1572
02:34:40.731 --> 02:34:42.482
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1573
02:34:44.651 --> 02:34:49.072
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1574
02:34:49.239 --> 02:34:52.284
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1575
02:34:55.913 --> 02:34:57.831
Send out riders, my lord.

1576
02:34:58.123 --> 02:35:01.001
You must call for aid.

1577
02:35:04.254 --> 02:35:06.506
And who will come?

1578
02:35:06.924 --> 02:35:08.508
Elves?

1579
02:35:08.675 --> 02:35:10.761
Dwarves?

1580
02:35:11.511 --> 02:35:14.389
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1581
02:35:15.224 --> 02:35:17.517
The old alliances are dead.

1582
02:35:17.935 --> 02:35:20.729
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1583
02:35:20.896 --> 02:35:23.106
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1584
02:35:24.066 --> 02:35:27.319
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1585
02:35:27.486 --> 02:35:29.404
Where was Gon...?

1586
02:35:32.074 --> 02:35:34.034
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1587
02:35:35.619 --> 02:35:38.080
we are alone.

1588
02:35:44.962 --> 02:35:46.713
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1589
02:35:46.880 --> 02:35:48.274
We need more time
to lay provisions...

1590
02:35:48.298 --> 02:35:51.802
There is no time. War is upon us.

1591
02:35:52.052 --> 02:35:53.762
Secure the gate.

1592
02:35:58.976 --> 02:36:01.061
We Ents have not troubled...

1593
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:04.648
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1594
02:36:05.399 --> 02:36:08.402
for a very long time.

1595
02:36:09.653 --> 02:36:14.408
But now, something
is about to happen...

1596
02:36:14.574 --> 02:36:16.910
that has not happened...

1597
02:36:17.119 --> 02:36:19.579
for an age.

1598
02:36:20.789 --> 02:36:23.083
Entmoot.

1599
02:36:23.458 --> 02:36:24.501
What's that?

1600
02:36:24.918 --> 02:36:27.754
'Tis a gathering.

1601
02:36:28.922 --> 02:36:31.508
A gathering of what?

1602
02:36:49.443 --> 02:36:51.778
Beech. Oak.

1603
02:36:51.945 --> 02:36:53.864
Chestnut. Ash.

1604
02:36:54.114 --> 02:36:56.116
Good. Good. Good.

1605
02:36:56.283 --> 02:36:58.618
Many have come.

1606
02:37:06.168 --> 02:37:08.962
Now we must decide
if the Ents...

1607
02:37:09.129 --> 02:37:11.673
will go to war.

1608
02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:23.685
Move back! Move to the caves!

1609
02:37:26.146 --> 02:37:28.231
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1610
02:37:28.648 --> 02:37:30.942
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1611
02:37:31.109 --> 02:37:33.403
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1612
02:37:33.570 --> 02:37:36.698
Aragorn, you must rest.

1613
02:37:36.865 --> 02:37:38.367
You're no use to us half alive.

1614
02:37:39.743 --> 02:37:40.952
Aragorn!

1615
02:37:44.331 --> 02:37:47.376
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1616
02:37:47.542 --> 02:37:49.211
That is an honorable charge.

1617
02:37:49.378 --> 02:37:52.255
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1618
02:37:52.422 --> 02:37:54.132
What renown is there in that?

1619
02:37:54.299 --> 02:37:58.011
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1620
02:37:58.261 --> 02:38:01.056
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1621
02:38:01.223 --> 02:38:06.228
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1622
02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:09.356
You do not command
the others to stay!

1623
02:38:09.523 --> 02:38:13.276
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1624
02:38:14.444 --> 02:38:16.655
Because they love you.

1625
02:38:23.745 --> 02:38:25.288
I'm sorry.

1626
02:39:31.188 --> 02:39:34.483
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1627
02:39:35.567 --> 02:39:37.360
These are no soldiers.

1628
02:39:39.613 --> 02:39:43.116
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1629
02:39:47.037 --> 02:39:49.956
Look at them. They're frightened.

1630
02:39:50.123 --> 02:39:51.583
I can see it in their eyes.

1631
02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:58.450
[Boe a hyn]
And they should be...

1632
02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:58.452

1633
02:39:58.950 --> 02:40:01.950
[Neled herain... dan caer menig.]
Three hundred... Against ten thousand.

1634
02:39:58.950 --> 02:40:01.950

1635
02:40:02.700 --> 02:40:05.700
[Si, beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.]
They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras.

1636
02:40:03.700 --> 02:40:05.700

1637
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:09.950
[Aragorn, nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.]
Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.

1638
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:09.950

1639
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:12.450
[Natha daged dhaer]
They are all going to die!

1640
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:12.450

1641
02:40:12.521 --> 02:40:14.731
Then I shall die as one of them!

1642
02:40:21.154 --> 02:40:22.989
Let him go, lad.

1643
02:40:23.573 --> 02:40:25.492
Let him be.

1644
02:40:26.993 --> 02:40:32.499
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1645
02:40:36.753 --> 02:40:38.672
My lord?

1646
02:40:40.715 --> 02:40:43.301
Who am I, Gamling?

1647
02:40:46.680 --> 02:40:50.559
You are our king, sire.

1648
02:40:53.562 --> 02:40:56.856
And do you trust your king?

1649
02:40:58.358 --> 02:41:01.528
Your men, my lord...

1650
02:41:01.695 --> 02:41:04.531
will follow you to whatever end.

1651
02:41:11.371 --> 02:41:13.290
To whatever end.

1652
02:41:23.133 --> 02:41:26.720
Where is the horse and the rider?

1653
02:41:26.886 --> 02:41:29.931
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1654
02:41:31.433 --> 02:41:35.895
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1655
02:41:36.896 --> 02:41:40.108
Like wind in the meadow.

1656
02:41:43.778 --> 02:41:47.574
The days have gone down in the West...

1657
02:41:48.241 --> 02:41:50.910
behind the hills...

1658
02:41:52.787 --> 02:41:54.414
into Shadow.

1659
02:42:02.881 --> 02:42:06.301
How did it come to this?

1660
02:42:22.609 --> 02:42:24.235
Huh?

1661
02:42:27.614 --> 02:42:29.449
It's been going for hours.

1662
02:42:30.617 --> 02:42:33.036
They must have decided something
by now.

1663
02:42:33.203 --> 02:42:37.290
Decided? No.

1664
02:42:37.457 --> 02:42:42.629
We only just finished saying...

1665
02:42:43.797 --> 02:42:45.674
good morning.

1666
02:42:47.008 --> 02:42:50.220
But it's nighttime already.

1667
02:42:50.387 --> 02:42:52.180
You can't take forever.

1668
02:42:53.181 --> 02:42:55.266
Don't be hasty.

1669
02:42:55.684 --> 02:42:58.103
We're running out of time!

1670
02:43:01.147 --> 02:43:04.067
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1671
02:43:21.626 --> 02:43:22.961
Give me your sword.

1672
02:43:32.429 --> 02:43:33.638
What is your name?

1673
02:43:34.180 --> 02:43:36.516
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.

1674
02:43:38.685 --> 02:43:41.312
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1675
02:43:43.273 --> 02:43:45.233
They say that it is hopeless.

1676
02:44:03.042 --> 02:44:04.711
This is a good sword.

1677
02:44:06.713 --> 02:44:09.048
Haleth, son of Háma...

1678
02:44:13.386 --> 02:44:15.555
there is always hope.

1679
02:44:38.536 --> 02:44:41.915
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1680
02:44:42.081 --> 02:44:43.625
Forgive me.

1681
02:44:43.792 --> 02:44:45.251
I was wrong to despair.

1682
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:50.653
[Ú-moe edaved, Legolas]
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1683
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:50.653

1684
02:44:54.093 --> 02:44:57.263
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1685
02:45:00.683 --> 02:45:02.769
It's a little tight across the chest.

1686
02:45:08.942 --> 02:45:10.902
That is no Orc horn.

1687
02:45:16.574 --> 02:45:18.409
Send for the king.

1688
02:45:18.576 --> 02:45:22.163
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1689
02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:55.488
How is this possible?

1690
02:45:56.489 --> 02:46:00.159
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1691
02:46:00.326 --> 02:46:03.538
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1692
02:46:04.247 --> 02:46:08.501
Long ago we fought and died together.

1693
02:46:10.753 --> 02:46:13.673
We come to honor that allegiance.

1694
02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:16.450
[Mae govannen, Haldir!]
Well met, Haldir!

1695
02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:16.450



1696
02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:24.058
You are most welcome.

1697
02:46:29.439 --> 02:46:33.234
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1698
02:47:07.018 --> 02:47:10.271
You could have picked a better spot.

1699
02:47:15.109 --> 02:47:19.322
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1700
02:47:25.453 --> 02:47:27.246
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1701
02:47:27.872 --> 02:47:30.375
Let's hope they last the night.

1702
02:48:30.450 --> 02:48:33.977
[A Eruchîn, ú-dano I faelas a hyn...]
Show them no mercy...

1703
02:48:30.450 --> 02:48:33.977

1704
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:37.750
[an uben tanatha le faelas!]
for you shall receive none!

1705
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:37.750

1706
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:14.645
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1707
02:49:15.897 --> 02:49:17.690
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1708
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:58.950
[Dartho!]
Hold!

1709
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:58.950

1710
02:50:20.878 --> 02:50:22.713
So it begins.

1711
02:50:28.450 --> 02:50:30.450
[Tangado a chadad!]
Prepare to fire!

1712
02:50:28.450 --> 02:50:30.450



1713
02:50:30.487 --> 02:50:32.587
Prepare to fire!

1714
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:40.161
[Faeg I-varv dîn na lanc...]
Their armour is weak at the neck... 

1715
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:40.161

1716
02:50:40.450 --> 02:50:42.450
[a nu ranc!]
and beneath the arm.

1717
02:50:40.450 --> 02:50:42.450

1718
02:50:42.575 --> 02:50:44.961

1719
02:50:42.575 --> 02:50:44.961
[Hado I philinn!]
Release arrows!

1720
02:50:49.574 --> 02:50:50.908
Did they hit anything?

1721
02:50:51.576 --> 02:50:53.578
Give them a volley.

1722
02:50:53.744 --> 02:50:55.872
- Fire!
- Fire!

1723
02:51:01.459 --> 02:51:04.459
[Hado i philinn!]
Release arrows!

1724
02:51:11.596 --> 02:51:13.264
Send them to me! Come on!

1725
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:34.050
[Pendraith!]
Ladders!

1726
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:34.050


1727
02:51:34.076 --> 02:51:35.119
Good!

1728
02:51:41.918 --> 02:51:44.921
Swords! Swords!

1729
02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.127
Legolas! Two already!

1730
02:52:25.294 --> 02:52:27.421
I'm on 17!

1731
02:52:27.588 --> 02:52:30.174
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1732
02:52:36.973 --> 02:52:38.683
Nineteen!

1733
02:53:04.667 --> 02:53:06.085
Merry.

1734
02:53:10.506 --> 02:53:14.302
We have just agreed.

1735
02:53:24.312 --> 02:53:25.771
Yes?

1736
02:53:27.273 --> 02:53:31.444
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1737
02:53:32.570 --> 02:53:35.823
and we have agreed...

1738
02:53:36.282 --> 02:53:40.328
you are not Orcs.

1739
02:53:42.079 --> 02:53:44.206
Well, that's good news.

1740
02:53:44.373 --> 02:53:48.502
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1741
02:53:49.128 --> 02:53:52.923
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1742
02:53:53.090 --> 02:53:54.633
Hasty?

1743
02:53:55.426 --> 02:53:57.303
Our friends are out there.

1744
02:53:57.470 --> 02:54:01.640
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1745
02:54:01.974 --> 02:54:04.268
War? Yes.

1746
02:54:04.435 --> 02:54:06.312
It affects us all.

1747
02:54:06.479 --> 02:54:09.482
Tree, root and twig.

1748
02:54:10.358 --> 02:54:14.403
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1749
02:54:14.612 --> 02:54:16.530
it takes a long time...

1750
02:54:16.697 --> 02:54:21.619
to say anything in Old Entish...

1751
02:54:21.786 --> 02:54:25.998
and we never say anything...

1752
02:54:26.165 --> 02:54:30.086
unless it is worth taking...

1753
02:54:30.252 --> 02:54:34.298
a long time to say.

1754
02:54:35.091 --> 02:54:38.386
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1755
02:54:38.552 --> 02:54:39.637
Nineteen!

1756
02:54:40.179 --> 02:54:42.056
Twenty!

1757
02:54:42.223 --> 02:54:43.891
Twenty-one!

1758
02:54:53.984 --> 02:54:55.975
[Na fennas!]
Causeway! 

1759
02:54:53.984 --> 02:54:55.975

1760
02:54:56.350 --> 02:54:58.850
[Hado ribed! Hado!]
Shoot continoulsy! Shoot!

1761
02:55:03.744 --> 02:55:06.122
Is this it?

1762
02:55:06.288 --> 02:55:09.208
Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?

1763
02:55:35.217 --> 02:55:37.398

1764
02:55:35.217 --> 02:55:37.398
[Togo hon dad, Legolas!]
Bring him down, Legolas!

1765
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:40.950
[Dago hon!]
Kill him!

1766
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:40.950

1767
02:55:41.450 --> 02:55:42.950
[Dago hon!]
Kill him!

1768
02:55:41.450 --> 02:55:42.950

1769
02:56:35.211 --> 02:56:36.587
Brace the gate!

1770
02:56:54.897 --> 02:56:57.149
Hold them! Stand firm!

1771
02:57:05.032 --> 02:57:06.367
Aragorn!

1772
02:57:10.996 --> 02:57:12.206
Gimli!

1773
02:57:18.462 --> 02:57:20.462
[Hado I philinn!]
Hurl the arrows!

1774
02:57:18.462 --> 02:57:20.462



1775
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:24.950
[Herio!]
Charge!

1776
02:57:22.950 --> 02:57:24.950

1777
02:58:00.963 --> 02:58:04.883
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1778
02:58:05.676 --> 02:58:09.680
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1779
02:58:10.514 --> 02:58:12.600
How can that be your decision?!

1780
02:58:13.267 --> 02:58:16.895
This is not our war.

1781
02:58:17.187 --> 02:58:19.398
But you're part of this world!

1782
02:58:23.527 --> 02:58:25.362
Aren't you?!

1783
02:58:29.450 --> 02:58:31.827
You must help. Please.

1784
02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:35.873
You must do something.

1785
02:58:36.165 --> 02:58:40.461
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1786
02:58:41.670 --> 02:58:45.382
But your part in this tale is over.

1787
02:58:45.549 --> 02:58:47.801
Go back to your home.

1788
02:58:57.811 --> 02:59:00.064
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1789
02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:02.107
We don't belong here, Merry.

1790
02:59:02.274 --> 02:59:04.568
It's too big for us.

1791
02:59:04.735 --> 02:59:07.404
What can we do in the end?

1792
02:59:09.698 --> 02:59:12.326
We've got the Shire.

1793
02:59:12.868 --> 02:59:15.412
Maybe we should go home.

1794
02:59:17.247 --> 02:59:20.459
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1795
02:59:20.626 --> 02:59:25.547
and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1796
02:59:25.714 --> 02:59:27.299
And...

1797
02:59:29.093 --> 02:59:32.179
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1798
02:59:35.724 --> 02:59:38.644
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1799
02:59:58.163 --> 02:59:59.415
Aragorn!

1800
02:59:59.581 --> 03:00:01.959
Fall back to the Keep!

1801
03:00:02.126 --> 03:00:05.212
Get your men out of there!

1802
03:00:06.450 --> 03:00:08.450
[Nan barad!]
To the keep!

1803
03:00:06.450 --> 03:00:08.450


1804
03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:14.450
[Nan barad!]
To the keep!

1805
03:00:12.450 --> 03:00:14.450

1806
03:00:14.847 --> 03:00:16.521
Haldir!

1807
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:20.450
[Nan barad!]
To the keep!

1808
03:00:17.450 --> 03:00:20.450

1809
03:00:20.644 --> 03:00:23.897
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1810
03:00:24.810 --> 03:00:26.110
Pull back!

1811
03:00:42.776 --> 03:00:44.334
Haldir!

1812
03:01:27.044 --> 03:01:28.545
Brace the gate!

1813
03:01:30.756 --> 03:01:32.049
Hold them!

1814
03:01:33.884 --> 03:01:37.262
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1815
03:02:05.415 --> 03:02:07.334
Make way!

1816
03:02:10.254 --> 03:02:11.964
We cannot hold much longer!

1817
03:02:17.928 --> 03:02:21.515
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1818
03:02:21.682 --> 03:02:24.268
As long as you can give me.

1819
03:02:24.434 --> 03:02:26.103
Gimli!

1820
03:02:27.563 --> 03:02:28.939
Timbers!

1821
03:02:29.106 --> 03:02:31.066
Brace the gate!

1822
03:02:45.831 --> 03:02:47.541
Come on. We can take them.

1823
03:02:48.375 --> 03:02:50.002
It's a long way.

1824
03:02:55.257 --> 03:02:57.009
Toss me.

1825
03:02:58.176 --> 03:03:00.012
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1826
03:03:00.178 --> 03:03:01.763
You'll have to toss me!

1827
03:03:07.352 --> 03:03:08.645
Don't tell the Elf.

1828
03:03:09.146 --> 03:03:10.939
Not a word.

1829
03:03:26.163 --> 03:03:27.623
Shore up the door!

1830
03:03:27.789 --> 03:03:29.875
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1831
03:03:30.042 --> 03:03:31.126
Watch our backs!

1832
03:03:35.255 --> 03:03:37.507
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1833
03:04:27.432 --> 03:04:28.850
Hold fast the gate!

1834
03:04:33.063 --> 03:04:36.024
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1835
03:04:40.737 --> 03:04:42.364
Aragorn!

1836
03:05:15.772 --> 03:05:18.233
Pull everybody back.

1837
03:05:18.608 --> 03:05:20.402
Pull them back.

1838
03:05:20.944 --> 03:05:25.073
Fall back!

1839
03:05:26.241 --> 03:05:27.826
They have broken through!

1840
03:05:27.993 --> 03:05:30.370
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1841
03:05:30.537 --> 03:05:32.789
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1842
03:05:32.956 --> 03:05:35.542
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1843
03:05:35.709 --> 03:05:37.961
Into the Keep!

1844
03:05:49.431 --> 03:05:54.394
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1845
03:05:54.561 --> 03:05:59.274
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1846
03:06:04.988 --> 03:06:06.281
Wait! Stop!

1847
03:06:07.157 --> 03:06:08.658
Stop!

1848
03:06:11.787 --> 03:06:13.497
Turn around.

1849
03:06:14.414 --> 03:06:17.125
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1850
03:06:17.292 --> 03:06:22.297
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1851
03:06:22.631 --> 03:06:25.342
Yes. Exactly.

1852
03:06:25.509 --> 03:06:28.720
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1853
03:06:28.887 --> 03:06:31.556
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1854
03:06:31.723 --> 03:06:33.725
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1855
03:06:36.353 --> 03:06:39.356
That doesn't make sense to me.

1856
03:06:39.523 --> 03:06:40.690
But then...

1857
03:06:40.857 --> 03:06:43.568
you are very small.

1858
03:06:44.027 --> 03:06:45.821
Perhaps you're right.

1859
03:06:48.448 --> 03:06:49.991
South it is, then.

1860
03:06:51.493 --> 03:06:54.830
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1861
03:06:56.873 --> 03:06:59.626
I always like going south.

1862
03:06:59.793 --> 03:07:04.089
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1863
03:07:04.714 --> 03:07:07.175
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1864
03:07:07.342 --> 03:07:09.261
No, we won't.

1865
03:07:10.011 --> 03:07:12.264
Not this time.

1866
03:07:18.895 --> 03:07:19.938
Look!

1867
03:07:21.565 --> 03:07:24.025
Osgiliath burns!

1868
03:07:24.192 --> 03:07:25.610
Mordor has come.

1869
03:07:26.736 --> 03:07:29.156
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1870
03:07:30.490 --> 03:07:32.701
It has only the power to destroy.

1871
03:07:33.577 --> 03:07:35.036
Please...

1872
03:07:35.203 --> 03:07:36.830
let me go.

1873
03:07:37.873 --> 03:07:39.457
Hurry.

1874
03:07:42.919 --> 03:07:44.337
Faramir!

1875
03:07:44.504 --> 03:07:46.840
You must let me go!

1876
03:07:47.424 --> 03:07:50.886
And those little family of field mice...

1877
03:07:51.052 --> 03:07:53.889
that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1878
03:07:54.598 --> 03:07:57.934
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1879
03:08:09.112 --> 03:08:12.032
Many of these trees were my friends.

1880
03:08:12.741 --> 03:08:17.370
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1881
03:08:18.538 --> 03:08:19.748
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1882
03:08:19.915 --> 03:08:22.667
They had voices of their own.

1883
03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:27.464
Saruman.

1884
03:08:27.797 --> 03:08:30.884
A wizard should know better!

1885
03:08:45.148 --> 03:08:48.818
There is no curse in Elvish...

1886
03:08:48.985 --> 03:08:51.655
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1887
03:08:51.821 --> 03:08:54.157
for this treachery.

1888
03:08:55.575 --> 03:08:58.411
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1889
03:09:03.124 --> 03:09:04.334
Where are they going?

1890
03:09:04.834 --> 03:09:08.088
They have business with the Orcs.

1891
03:09:08.546 --> 03:09:12.842
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1892
03:09:13.009 --> 03:09:15.637
with rock and stone.

1893
03:09:39.536 --> 03:09:40.704
Yes.

1894
03:09:41.788 --> 03:09:43.206
Come, my friends.

1895
03:09:44.541 --> 03:09:48.753
The Ents are going to war.

1896
03:09:48.920 --> 03:09:50.714
It is likely...

1897
03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:54.384
that we go to our doom.

1898
03:09:55.802 --> 03:09:58.263
Last march...

1899
03:09:58.805 --> 03:10:00.849
of the Ents.

1900
03:10:48.938 --> 03:10:52.692
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1901
03:10:52.859 --> 03:10:54.944
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1902
03:10:57.697 --> 03:10:59.157
Mr. Frodo?

1903
03:10:59.449 --> 03:11:03.578
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1904
03:11:03.745 --> 03:11:06.247
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1905
03:11:20.553 --> 03:11:21.971
Take them to my father.

1906
03:11:23.515 --> 03:11:26.518
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1907
03:11:28.937 --> 03:11:31.981
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1908
03:11:33.149 --> 03:11:35.819
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1909
03:11:36.486 --> 03:11:39.239
You want to know
why your brother died?

1910
03:11:39.739 --> 03:11:43.493
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1911
03:11:43.660 --> 03:11:45.537
He tried to kill him!

1912
03:11:45.703 --> 03:11:48.039
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1913
03:11:48.832 --> 03:11:50.667
Watch out!

1914
03:12:01.594 --> 03:12:02.720
Mr. Frodo?

1915
03:12:05.348 --> 03:12:07.183
They're here.

1916
03:12:10.311 --> 03:12:12.772
They've come.

1917
03:12:15.358 --> 03:12:17.235
Nazgûl!

1918
03:12:39.382 --> 03:12:41.551
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1919
03:12:43.344 --> 03:12:45.555
Take cover!

1920
03:13:02.906 --> 03:13:04.449
The fortress is taken.

1921
03:13:05.241 --> 03:13:06.409
It is over.

1922
03:13:06.576 --> 03:13:10.538
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1923
03:13:10.705 --> 03:13:13.625
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1924
03:13:16.377 --> 03:13:17.754
They're breaking in!

1925
03:13:20.423 --> 03:13:22.926
They're past the door!

1926
03:13:26.262 --> 03:13:30.391
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1927
03:13:33.061 --> 03:13:34.979
Is there no other way?

1928
03:13:36.564 --> 03:13:39.609
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1929
03:13:40.276 --> 03:13:42.487
But they will not get far.
The Uruk-hai are too many.

1930
03:13:47.367 --> 03:13:49.786
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1931
03:13:49.953 --> 03:13:52.789
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1932
03:13:54.958 --> 03:13:58.378
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1933
03:14:03.049 --> 03:14:04.467
Ride out with me.

1934
03:14:08.596 --> 03:14:10.223
Ride out and meet them.

1935
03:14:10.974 --> 03:14:13.142
For death and glory.

1936
03:14:13.309 --> 03:14:14.727
For Rohan.

1937
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:17.689
For your people.

1938
03:14:18.439 --> 03:14:20.358
The sun is rising.

1939
03:14:24.862 --> 03:14:27.865
Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

1940
03:14:28.032 --> 03:14:29.450
At dawn...

1941
03:14:29.617 --> 03:14:31.327
look to the east.

1942
03:14:35.498 --> 03:14:37.166
Yes.

1943
03:14:39.627 --> 03:14:41.296
Yes.

1944
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:45.008
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1945
03:14:45.174 --> 03:14:48.011
shall sound in the Deep...

1946
03:14:48.428 --> 03:14:50.430
one last time.

1947
03:14:50.597 --> 03:14:52.098
Yes!

1948
03:14:55.143 --> 03:14:58.938
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1949
03:15:06.696 --> 03:15:08.031
Fell deeds, awake.

1950
03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:10.366
Now for wrath...

1951
03:15:10.533 --> 03:15:13.911
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1952
03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:22.960
[Forð Eorlingas!]
Forth Eorlingas!

1953
03:15:20.960 --> 03:15:22.960



1954
03:16:11.010 --> 03:16:12.261
Gandalf.

1955
03:16:19.519 --> 03:16:23.189
Théoden King stands alone.

1956
03:16:23.773 --> 03:16:25.942
Not alone.

1957
03:16:26.359 --> 03:16:27.485
Rohirrim!

1958
03:16:33.408 --> 03:16:34.575
Éomer.

1959
03:16:34.742 --> 03:16:37.286
To the king!

1960
03:17:54.864 --> 03:17:56.657
Yes!

1961
03:18:05.792 --> 03:18:09.086
A hit. A fine hit.

1962
03:18:33.778 --> 03:18:36.239
Break the dam!

1963
03:18:36.405 --> 03:18:39.867
Release the river!

1964
03:19:07.186 --> 03:19:09.939
Pippin! Hold on!

1965
03:19:15.194 --> 03:19:18.114
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1966
03:19:59.488 --> 03:20:01.490
What are you doing?

1967
03:20:10.082 --> 03:20:11.667
Where are you going?

1968
03:21:09.809 --> 03:21:11.143
It's me.

1969
03:21:13.646 --> 03:21:15.856
It's your Sam.

1970
03:21:20.194 --> 03:21:22.822
Don't you know your Sam?

1971
03:21:40.548 --> 03:21:43.926
I can't do this, Sam.

1972
03:21:44.802 --> 03:21:46.804
I know.

1973
03:21:47.805 --> 03:21:50.182
It's all wrong.

1974
03:21:50.933 --> 03:21:52.935
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1975
03:22:00.359 --> 03:22:02.445
But we are.

1976
03:22:08.868 --> 03:22:11.912
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1977
03:22:12.079 --> 03:22:14.457
The ones that really mattered.

1978
03:22:15.499 --> 03:22:18.502
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1979
03:22:18.669 --> 03:22:21.630
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1980
03:22:21.797 --> 03:22:24.759
because how could the end be happy?

1981
03:22:27.303 --> 03:22:29.513
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1982
03:22:29.680 --> 03:22:33.184
when so much bad had happened?

1983
03:22:34.018 --> 03:22:35.936
Victory!

1984
03:22:36.103 --> 03:22:37.646
We have victory!

1985
03:22:37.813 --> 03:22:41.776
But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1986
03:22:41.942 --> 03:22:43.277
this shadow.

1987
03:22:43.444 --> 03:22:45.821
Even darkness must pass.

1988
03:22:45.988 --> 03:22:48.699
A new day will come.

1989
03:22:48.866 --> 03:22:52.828
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1990
03:22:54.747 --> 03:22:57.124
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1991
03:22:57.291 --> 03:22:59.043
that meant something.

1992
03:22:59.210 --> 03:23:01.796
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1993
03:23:03.172 --> 03:23:07.009
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1994
03:23:07.176 --> 03:23:08.761
I know now.

1995
03:23:09.595 --> 03:23:11.806
Folk in those stories...

1996
03:23:11.972 --> 03:23:16.102
had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1997
03:23:16.268 --> 03:23:18.521
They kept going...

1998
03:23:19.188 --> 03:23:22.441
because they were holding
on to something.

1999
03:23:24.026 --> 03:23:26.362
What are we holding on to, Sam?

2000
03:23:38.290 --> 03:23:42.211
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

2001
03:23:42.503 --> 03:23:45.131
And it's worth fighting for.

2002
03:24:12.032 --> 03:24:16.328
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

2003
03:24:17.079 --> 03:24:21.041
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

2004
03:24:21.208 --> 03:24:23.419
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

2005
03:24:27.756 --> 03:24:29.175
Then it is forfeit.

2006
03:24:31.927 --> 03:24:33.721
Release them.

2007
03:24:45.774 --> 03:24:47.818
Stay out of the forest!

2008
03:24:47.985 --> 03:24:49.778
Keep away from the trees!

2009
03:25:40.621 --> 03:25:42.414
Final count...

2010
03:25:42.581 --> 03:25:45.501
- 42.
- Forty-two?

2011
03:25:45.668 --> 03:25:51.715
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
Elvish princeling.

2012
03:25:52.508 --> 03:25:56.178
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

2013
03:26:00.307 --> 03:26:03.602
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

2014
03:26:04.353 --> 03:26:06.855
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

2015
03:26:07.022 --> 03:26:11.652
because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

2016
03:26:13.946 --> 03:26:18.659
- He doesn't look happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

2017
03:26:18.909 --> 03:26:22.454
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

2018
03:26:22.621 --> 03:26:25.582
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

2019
03:26:25.749 --> 03:26:28.585
I hear the staff are very good.

2020
03:26:34.258 --> 03:26:36.635
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

2021
03:26:36.802 --> 03:26:41.056
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

2022
03:26:41.223 --> 03:26:42.474
I'm starving.

2023
03:26:42.641 --> 03:26:45.728
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

2024
03:26:45.894 --> 03:26:48.981
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

2025
03:27:12.921 --> 03:27:15.341
Saruman's storeroom!

2026
03:27:17.676 --> 03:27:20.429
I don't believe it.

2027
03:27:20.596 --> 03:27:22.639
It can't be.

2028
03:27:23.265 --> 03:27:26.143
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

2029
03:27:27.436 --> 03:27:29.772
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

2030
03:27:30.105 --> 03:27:33.233
It's perfect. One barrel each.

2031
03:27:33.400 --> 03:27:34.526
Wait.

2032
03:27:35.277 --> 03:27:36.629
Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?

2033
03:27:36.653 --> 03:27:38.197
Share it?

2034
03:27:40.032 --> 03:27:42.451
No. No.

2035
03:27:43.952 --> 03:27:45.287
Dead plant and all that.

2036
03:27:45.704 --> 03:27:47.873
Don't think he'd understand.

2037
03:27:49.124 --> 03:27:51.335
Could be a distant relative.

2038
03:27:52.127 --> 03:27:54.630
I get it.

2039
03:27:54.797 --> 03:27:57.633
Don't be hasty.

2040
03:27:58.717 --> 03:28:00.469
Exactly.

2041
03:28:01.553 --> 03:28:03.806
Bar-hrum.

2042
03:28:29.456 --> 03:28:30.749
This is the old sewer.

2043
03:28:30.916 --> 03:28:34.044
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

2044
03:28:34.211 --> 03:28:35.963
You'll find cover in the woods there.

2045
03:28:37.005 --> 03:28:39.508
Captain Faramir...

2046
03:28:40.134 --> 03:28:41.969
you have shown your quality, sir.

2047
03:28:44.471 --> 03:28:45.764
The very highest.

2048
03:28:46.265 --> 03:28:48.892
The Shire must truly be a great realm,
Master Gamgee...

2049
03:28:49.059 --> 03:28:52.020
where gardeners are held in high honor.

2050
03:28:53.188 --> 03:28:55.190
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

2051
03:28:55.774 --> 03:28:57.359
Gollum says there's a path...

2052
03:28:57.526 --> 03:29:01.447
near Minas Morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

2053
03:29:01.905 --> 03:29:03.657
Cirith Ungol?

2054
03:29:07.202 --> 03:29:09.746
- Is that its name?
- No.

2055
03:29:09.913 --> 03:29:11.582
No!

2056
03:29:12.416 --> 03:29:15.419
- Yes.
- Frodo...

2057
03:29:15.794 --> 03:29:19.339
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

2058
03:29:20.215 --> 03:29:22.759
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

2059
03:29:23.093 --> 03:29:29.391
Master says we must go to Mordor,
so we must try.

2060
03:29:30.893 --> 03:29:32.686
I must.

2061
03:29:36.231 --> 03:29:39.818
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all Men.

2062
03:29:39.985 --> 03:29:42.029
Thank you.

2063
03:29:53.832 --> 03:29:57.961
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

2064
03:30:10.432 --> 03:30:11.975
Come on, keep up.

2065
03:30:15.437 --> 03:30:18.232
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers
to hurt you.

2066
03:30:18.857 --> 03:30:20.692
You know that, don't you?

2067
03:30:21.485 --> 03:30:23.070
He was trying to save you, see?

2068
03:30:23.570 --> 03:30:25.113
Save me?

2069
03:30:25.447 --> 03:30:27.616
So there's no hard feelings.

2070
03:30:27.783 --> 03:30:32.913
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2071
03:30:33.080 --> 03:30:35.707
Gollum, Gollum.

2072
03:30:36.750 --> 03:30:38.502
Nice master.

2073
03:30:39.586 --> 03:30:42.422
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2074
03:30:42.589 --> 03:30:44.883
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2075
03:30:50.389 --> 03:30:55.602
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

2076
03:31:02.734 --> 03:31:05.737
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2077
03:31:06.405 --> 03:31:09.950
The battle for Middle-earth
is about to begin.

2078
03:31:15.080 --> 03:31:18.500
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits...

2079
03:31:19.501 --> 03:31:22.713
somewhere in the wilderness.

2080
03:31:26.008 --> 03:31:29.428
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

2081
03:31:29.595 --> 03:31:30.971
What?

2082
03:31:31.138 --> 03:31:35.100
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2083
03:31:35.267 --> 03:31:38.520
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

2084
03:31:38.687 --> 03:31:41.648
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

2085
03:31:41.815 --> 03:31:43.483
"Yes, my boy.

2086
03:31:43.650 --> 03:31:47.446
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2087
03:31:47.613 --> 03:31:50.157
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

2088
03:31:50.324 --> 03:31:52.200
"Samwise the Brave."

2089
03:31:52.367 --> 03:31:55.120
I want to hear more about Sam.

2090
03:31:59.416 --> 03:32:02.419
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

2091
03:32:03.754 --> 03:32:07.799
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

2092
03:32:08.884 --> 03:32:10.260
So was I.

2093
03:32:19.144 --> 03:32:21.855
"Samwise the Brave."

2094
03:32:26.109 --> 03:32:27.444
Sméagol?

2095
03:32:27.611 --> 03:32:30.530
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

2096
03:32:30.697 --> 03:32:32.616
Master.

2097
03:32:32.783 --> 03:32:35.744
Master looks after us.

2098
03:32:36.536 --> 03:32:39.331
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2099
03:32:39.498 --> 03:32:41.958
Master broke his promise.

2100
03:32:42.125 --> 03:32:44.294
Don't ask Sméagol.

2101
03:32:44.461 --> 03:32:47.673
Poor, poor Sméagol.

2102
03:32:47.839 --> 03:32:50.676
Master betrayed us.

2103
03:32:50.842 --> 03:32:53.929
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2104
03:32:54.096 --> 03:32:58.016
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

2105
03:32:58.183 --> 03:33:00.936
Kill him! Kill him!

2106
03:33:01.103 --> 03:33:02.604
Kill them both!

2107
03:33:02.771 --> 03:33:06.400
And then we take the precious...

2108
03:33:06.566 --> 03:33:10.112
and we be the master!

2109
03:33:10.779 --> 03:33:13.448
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2110
03:33:13.615 --> 03:33:16.284
Eyes always watching.

2111
03:33:16.451 --> 03:33:19.996
Then we stabs them out.

2112
03:33:20.163 --> 03:33:24.668
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

2113
03:33:24.835 --> 03:33:28.296
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2114
03:33:28.463 --> 03:33:31.174
Kill them both.

2115
03:33:31.341 --> 03:33:33.844
Yes. No! No!

2116
03:33:34.010 --> 03:33:37.723
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2117
03:33:38.432 --> 03:33:41.017
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2118
03:33:41.184 --> 03:33:43.812
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Sméagol?

2119
03:33:43.979 --> 03:33:49.359
We could let her do it.

2120
03:33:50.318 --> 03:33:54.489
Yes. She could do it.

2121
03:33:54.656 --> 03:33:59.202
Yes, precious, she could.

2122
03:33:59.369 --> 03:34:05.417
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

2123
03:34:06.334 --> 03:34:08.086
Once they're dead.

2124
03:34:08.253 --> 03:34:10.255
Shh.

2125
03:34:13.592 --> 03:34:17.304
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2126
03:34:17.471 --> 03:34:19.514
Sméagol will show you the way.

2127
03:34:19.681 --> 03:34:21.933
Follow me.

2128
03:55:19.773 --> 03:55:21.775
