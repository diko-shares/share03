1
00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:20.838
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

2
00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:31.052
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:41.760
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:46.466
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

5
00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.833
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.665
No! No!

7
00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.841
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:35.178
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:37.683
No!

10
00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:41.714
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:52.223
Gandalf!

12
00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:55.457
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:59.127
Nothing.

14
00:04:06.407 --> 00:04:08.466
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:22.849
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:24.124 --> 00:04:27.252
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

17
00:04:38.105 --> 00:04:40.232
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:45.312
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:49.644
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:58.047
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:58.224 --> 00:05:01.455
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:06.623
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:09.059
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.467
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:13.006 --> 00:05:15.236
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15.842 --> 00:05:17.104
You never know.

27
00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:20.512
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:22.215 --> 00:05:26.151
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.411
It is special.

30
00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:35.192
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38.498 --> 00:05:40.932
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

32
00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:44.892
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45.738 --> 00:05:49.572
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:50.276 --> 00:05:52.210
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.513
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:57.649
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.652
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:27.302
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:29.674
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30.415 --> 00:06:32.178
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:36.587
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38.924 --> 00:06:41.688
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

43
00:06:43.328 --> 00:06:46.627
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:48.966
...but they did.

45
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.012
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:08.350
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:11.921
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24.568 --> 00:07:27.298
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:30.097
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:33.038
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.743
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48.492 --> 00:07:50.460
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.653
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54.532 --> 00:07:57.990
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:06.105
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.174
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:46.271
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:49.009
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49.752 --> 00:08:51.617
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.983
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:56.091
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:58.127 --> 00:09:00.357
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.034
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:23.777
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23.952 --> 00:09:27.911
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.751
Where is it?

67
00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:33.622
Where is it?

68
00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:37.526
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:41.931
My precious.

70
00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:46.069
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:50.337
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:47.230
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.925
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:49.136 --> 00:10:51.604
haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:59.168
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:16.958
It burns!

77
00:11:17.163 --> 00:11:19.461
It burns us!

78
00:11:20.934 --> 00:11:22.401
It freezes!

79
00:11:24.204 --> 00:11:26.468
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:29.301
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:36.978
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.744
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.511
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.386
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:48.094 --> 00:11:50.119
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52.532 --> 00:11:55.968
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:04.274
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:07.275
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10.383 --> 00:12:14.319
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14.487 --> 00:12:16.421
We swears.

91
00:12:16.723 --> 00:12:19.157
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

92
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.589
We swears...

93
00:12:23.862 --> 00:12:28.595
to serve the master of the precious.

94
00:12:30.235 --> 00:12:32.567
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32.738 --> 00:12:34.706
on the precious.

96
00:12:34.873 --> 00:12:37.068
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:37.242 --> 00:12:41.372
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:42.214 --> 00:12:43.545
Yes...

99
00:12:44.116 --> 00:12:46.607
on the precious.

100
00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:51.421
On the precious.

101
00:12:52.591 --> 00:12:54.081
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:56.128 --> 00:12:59.586
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59.832 --> 00:13:01.527
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.692
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

105
00:13:16.114 --> 00:13:20.642
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23.588 --> 00:13:25.317
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26.324 --> 00:13:27.916
Yes.

108
00:13:38.836 --> 00:13:41.464
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:50.047 --> 00:13:53.915
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:54.085 --> 00:13:58.886
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:59.056 --> 00:14:03.288
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03.494 --> 00:14:06.930
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

113
00:14:07.131 --> 00:14:13.092
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:13.271 --> 00:14:16.138
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:16.307 --> 00:14:21.438
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

116
00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:28.214
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.850
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:33.023 --> 00:14:35.253
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.949
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:39.719
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:42.021
Follow me!

122
00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:57.278
Merry!

123
00:14:58.248 --> 00:14:59.738
Merry!

124
00:15:05.255 --> 00:15:09.021
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:11.022
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11.895 --> 00:15:16.491
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:20.594
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.967
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.544
Merry!

130
00:15:32.281 --> 00:15:34.044
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.384
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39.822 --> 00:15:42.484
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:43.258 --> 00:15:47.194
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50.432 --> 00:15:52.093
Stop it!

135
00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:56.931
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59.608 --> 00:16:02.168
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:05.077
You want some?

138
00:16:05.814 --> 00:16:09.181
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12.588 --> 00:16:14.613
Merry.

140
00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:17.014
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:21.295
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21.463 --> 00:16:23.954
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:27.500
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:30.205 --> 00:16:31.934
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:34.242 --> 00:16:36.233
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:38.508
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40.648 --> 00:16:43.014
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:45.244
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:48.785
Let's move!

150
00:17:12.346 --> 00:17:14.871
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15.883 --> 00:17:17.851
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:18.019 --> 00:17:19.782
Hurry!

153
00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.187
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.328
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31.499 --> 00:17:34.468
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:38.627
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:10.036 --> 00:18:13.233
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:14.574 --> 00:18:16.940
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17.778 --> 00:18:20.406
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:23.016 --> 00:18:25.507
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:29.985
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:33.789
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:47.267
Rohan.

164
00:18:47.439 --> 00:18:50.237
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51.443 --> 00:18:54.003
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.149
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

167
00:18:57.316 --> 00:19:00.285
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:08.358
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08.527 --> 00:19:11.087
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11.931 --> 00:19:14.092
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:16.229
Saruman.

172
00:19:24.643 --> 00:19:27.840
The world is changing.

173
00:19:28.013 --> 00:19:33.610
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

174
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.050
and Mordor?

175
00:19:38.757 --> 00:19:44.388
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

176
00:19:44.562 --> 00:19:48.191
and the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:54.706 --> 00:19:57.675
Together, my Lord Sauron...

178
00:19:57.842 --> 00:20:01.369
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:20:17.462 --> 00:20:21.728
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

180
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.565
The forests will fall.

181
00:20:27.472 --> 00:20:30.339
A new order will rise.

182
00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:36.312
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

183
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:40.440
and the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:20:52.963 --> 00:20:56.194
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:56.366 --> 00:20:57.993
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:58.168 --> 00:21:01.194
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

187
00:21:01.371 --> 00:21:04.431
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:05.075 --> 00:21:07.441
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08.812 --> 00:21:13.078
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:16.850
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17.587 --> 00:21:19.885
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:22.025
Swear it.

193
00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:37.303
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38.408 --> 00:21:40.399
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40.577 --> 00:21:45.105
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:45.282 --> 00:21:46.715
Murderers!

197
00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:49.743
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49.952 --> 00:21:51.715
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54.957 --> 00:22:00.088
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

200
00:22:00.563 --> 00:22:03.088
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:07.360
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

202
00:22:07.536 --> 00:22:09.333
But no more.

203
00:22:09.505 --> 00:22:11.769
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13.943 --> 00:22:16.605
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:19.641
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:21.476
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21.684 --> 00:22:24.653
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24.854 --> 00:22:27.345
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27.656 --> 00:22:30.557
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30.726 --> 00:22:34.457
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39.368 --> 00:22:41.063
Quickly!

212
00:22:47.476 --> 00:22:49.034
Go, child.

213
00:23:01.923 --> 00:23:03.823
Rohan, my lord...

214
00:23:04.292 --> 00:23:07.022
is ready to fall.

215
00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:19.797
Theodred.

216
00:23:20.008 --> 00:23:21.635
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:38.093 --> 00:23:44.123
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:47.866
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:56.677 --> 00:23:58.474
He's alive.

220
00:24:29.276 --> 00:24:31.369
Theodred.

221
00:24:44.758 --> 00:24:47.784
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:50.686
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:52.232 --> 00:24:55.861
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:58.726
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.741
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:09.404
Grima.

227
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:12.784
Grima.

228
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:16.811
Grima.

229
00:25:17.623 --> 00:25:20.683
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

230
00:25:21.093 --> 00:25:24.688
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

231
00:25:25.364 --> 00:25:28.265
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:36.108 --> 00:25:41.876
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:42.081 --> 00:25:44.549
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44.717 --> 00:25:49.745
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49.956 --> 00:25:52.481
your warmongering.

236
00:25:54.694 --> 00:25:56.662
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56.829 --> 00:25:58.990
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59.832 --> 00:26:02.197
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02.434 --> 00:26:06.029
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18.516 --> 00:26:21.144
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21.353 --> 00:26:23.321
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31.396 --> 00:26:35.730
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.060
Too much.

244
00:26:39.404 --> 00:26:44.205
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:49.177
and all its domains under pain of death.

246
00:26:49.648 --> 00:26:51.980
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.618
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:55.153 --> 00:26:58.987
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:59.157 --> 00:27:01.318
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01.926 --> 00:27:04.519
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:36.093 --> 00:27:38.789
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:40.724
Breathe.

253
00:27:44.835 --> 00:27:48.669
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04.822 --> 00:28:06.847
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:07.024 --> 00:28:09.014
until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09.559 --> 00:28:11.527
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15.598 --> 00:28:17.156
Merry!

258
00:28:17.533 --> 00:28:18.864
Merry!

259
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:25.769
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:37.446
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:40.488
It's the trees.

262
00:28:41.224 --> 00:28:42.282
What?

263
00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:46.459
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46.629 --> 00:28:51.123
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.824
and come alive.

266
00:28:53.069 --> 00:28:54.764
Alive?

267
00:28:55.638 --> 00:28:57.333
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:00.809
talk to each other...

269
00:29:00.977 --> 00:29:02.774
even move.

270
00:29:04.414 --> 00:29:06.644
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06.816 --> 00:29:10.876
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

272
00:29:11.253 --> 00:29:12.515
Yeah!

273
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:15.986
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.555
What about them?

275
00:29:20.729 --> 00:29:22.629
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23.298 --> 00:29:27.064
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:33.041 --> 00:29:35.009
What about their legs?

278
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.508
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.177
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43.985 --> 00:29:48.888
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:49.257 --> 00:29:51.191
Alive?

282
00:29:54.162 --> 00:29:58.428
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00.836 --> 00:30:04.203
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04.372 --> 00:30:07.398
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:10.312 --> 00:30:12.177
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:12.347 --> 00:30:14.780
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

287
00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.618
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18.786 --> 00:30:19.980
a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26.794 --> 00:30:30.355
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

290
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:38.233
Pippin.

291
00:30:38.405 --> 00:30:40.100
Let's go.

292
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:50.039
Go on.

293
00:30:50.251 --> 00:30:51.718
Call for help.

294
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.212
Squeal.

295
00:30:54.421 --> 00:30:57.584
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06.767 --> 00:31:08.166
Pippin!

297
00:31:32.458 --> 00:31:34.949
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35.461 --> 00:31:38.396
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09.562 --> 00:32:11.427
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11.864 --> 00:32:14.298
what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.463
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:48.527
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:53.531
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:05.206
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05.651 --> 00:33:08.017
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

306
00:33:09.054 --> 00:33:11.113
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.731
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:26.264
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:29.668
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

310
00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:35.175
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

311
00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:37.608
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:44.087
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

313
00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:46.189
and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:51.151
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:51.328 --> 00:33:53.091
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:58.465
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:59.136 --> 00:34:01.536
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.673
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05.609 --> 00:34:09.375
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.777
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:14.884
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:17.518
They have taken two of our friends captive.

323
00:34:18.322 --> 00:34:20.790
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.121
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:27.263
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.591
We left none alive.

327
00:34:33.236 --> 00:34:36.205
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41.678 --> 00:34:42.906
Dead?

329
00:34:45.915 --> 00:34:47.610
I am sorry.

330
00:34:53.189 --> 00:34:55.487
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57.293 --> 00:35:01.957
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:03.166 --> 00:35:04.758
Farewell.

333
00:35:09.973 --> 00:35:12.203
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12.675 --> 00:35:14.905
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16.613 --> 00:35:19.173
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19.382 --> 00:35:21.373
We ride north!

337
00:36:11.967 --> 00:36:13.798
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
[Sindarin] <i>Hiro hyn hîdh ab ’wanath.</i>
[English] May they find peace after death.

339
00:36:27.616 --> 00:36:29.641
We failed them.

340
00:36:43.698 --> 00:36:45.859
A Hobbit lay here.

341
00:36:47.768 --> 00:36:49.395
And the other.

342
00:37:00.214 --> 00:37:01.806
They crawled.

343
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.013
Their hands were bound.

344
00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:21.998
Their bonds were cut.

345
00:37:37.484 --> 00:37:39.611
They ran over here.

346
00:37:43.256 --> 00:37:44.450
They were followed.

347
00:37:47.661 --> 00:37:49.390
The belt!

348
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.426
Run!

349
00:37:58.171 --> 00:37:59.502
Tracks lead away from the battle...

350
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:06.404
into Fangorn Forest.

351
00:38:07.314 --> 00:38:08.747
Fangorn?

352
00:38:08.915 --> 00:38:11.543
What madness drove them in there?

353
00:38:29.302 --> 00:38:32.294
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

354
00:38:39.011 --> 00:38:42.447
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

355
00:38:48.687 --> 00:38:49.676
Come here!

356
00:38:55.194 --> 00:38:57.754
Trees. Climb a tree.

357
00:39:07.072 --> 00:39:08.801
He's gone.

358
00:39:20.886 --> 00:39:23.218
Merry!

359
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.103
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

360
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.768
Run, Merry!

361
00:39:57.555 --> 00:40:01.889
Little Orcs.

362
00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.392
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

363
00:40:04.562 --> 00:40:06.462
Tree?

364
00:40:06.631 --> 00:40:09.623
I am no tree!

365
00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:12.028
I am an Ent.

366
00:40:12.603 --> 00:40:14.730
A tree-herder.

367
00:40:15.306 --> 00:40:17.274
A shepherd of the forest.

368
00:40:17.442 --> 00:40:18.807
Don't talk to it, Merry.

369
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.777
Don't encourage it!

370
00:40:20.978 --> 00:40:25.210
Treebeard, some call me.

371
00:40:25.383 --> 00:40:27.351
And whose side are you on?

372
00:40:27.952 --> 00:40:29.579
Side?

373
00:40:29.787 --> 00:40:32.654
I am on nobody's side...

374
00:40:33.024 --> 00:40:38.360
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

375
00:40:39.163 --> 00:40:43.793
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

376
00:40:44.202 --> 00:40:46.601
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

377
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.068
Hobbits?

378
00:40:50.307 --> 00:40:55.176
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

379
00:40:56.379 --> 00:41:00.873
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

380
00:41:01.051 --> 00:41:03.178
They come with fire.

381
00:41:03.386 --> 00:41:05.946
They come with axes.

382
00:41:06.156 --> 00:41:10.957
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

383
00:41:11.161 --> 00:41:14.961
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

384
00:41:15.198 --> 00:41:18.031
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

385
00:41:18.235 --> 00:41:20.032
Halflings!

386
00:41:20.203 --> 00:41:21.295
Shire-folk!

387
00:41:21.505 --> 00:41:23.837
Maybe you are...

388
00:41:24.141 --> 00:41:27.770
and maybe you aren't.

389
00:41:28.879 --> 00:41:32.781
The White Wizard will know.

390
00:41:33.583 --> 00:41:35.517
The White Wizard?

391
00:41:37.053 --> 00:41:38.543
Saruman.

392
00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:52.794
See? See?

393
00:41:53.035 --> 00:41:55.435
We've led you out.

394
00:41:55.604 --> 00:41:58.095
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

395
00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.678
Very lucky we find you.

396
00:42:10.352 --> 00:42:12.081
Nice Hobbit.

397
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.255
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

398
00:42:18.427 --> 00:42:21.055
A swamp, yes, yes.

399
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:26.529
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

400
00:42:28.871 --> 00:42:32.307
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

401
00:42:35.578 --> 00:42:38.206
I found it. I did.

402
00:42:38.414 --> 00:42:41.076
The way through the marshes.

403
00:42:41.283 --> 00:42:44.775
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

404
00:42:44.987 --> 00:42:49.048
They go around for miles and miles.

405
00:42:49.258 --> 00:42:50.691
Come quickly.

406
00:42:50.893 --> 00:42:54.953
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

407
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.463
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

408
00:42:59.634 --> 00:43:01.898
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

409
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.437
No, no birdses to eat.

410
00:43:05.673 --> 00:43:09.905
No crunchable birdses.

411
00:43:10.511 --> 00:43:13.378
We are famished! Yes!

412
00:43:13.548 --> 00:43:17.848
Famished we are, precious!

413
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.324
Here.

414
00:43:35.536 --> 00:43:37.527
What does it eats?

415
00:43:37.739 --> 00:43:39.707
Is it tasty?

416
00:43:45.013 --> 00:43:47.607
It tries to chokes us!

417
00:43:47.882 --> 00:43:51.545
We can't eats Hobbit food!

418
00:43:53.254 --> 00:43:57.280
We must starve!

419
00:43:57.457 --> 00:43:59.823
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

420
00:44:00.594 --> 00:44:02.789
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

421
00:44:02.996 --> 00:44:05.829
It does not care if we be hungry.

422
00:44:06.066 --> 00:44:10.799
Does not care if we should die.

423
00:44:11.438 --> 00:44:14.271
Not like master.

424
00:44:15.642 --> 00:44:17.735
Master cares.

425
00:44:18.912 --> 00:44:20.777
Master knows.

426
00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.218
Yes.

427
00:44:25.385 --> 00:44:28.013
Precious.

428
00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:35.220
Once it takes hold of us...

429
00:44:37.097 --> 00:44:41.261
it never lets go.

430
00:44:41.968 --> 00:44:43.128
Don't touch me!

431
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:17.466
There are dead things!

432
00:45:17.636 --> 00:45:19.399
Dead faces in the water.

433
00:45:24.243 --> 00:45:28.202
All dead. All rotten.

434
00:45:28.714 --> 00:45:32.480
Elves and Men and Orcses.

435
00:45:32.685 --> 00:45:36.314
A great battle long ago.

436
00:45:37.123 --> 00:45:38.852
Dead Marshes.

437
00:45:39.058 --> 00:45:41.788
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

438
00:45:43.496 --> 00:45:45.225
This way.

439
00:45:45.431 --> 00:45:48.195
Don't follow the lights.

440
00:45:49.935 --> 00:45:53.803
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

441
00:45:54.006 --> 00:45:58.102
and light little candles of their own.

442
00:46:24.302 --> 00:46:25.769
Frodo!

443
00:47:10.247 --> 00:47:14.911
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

444
00:47:15.085 --> 00:47:16.950
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

445
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.985
Are you all right?

446
00:47:47.885 --> 00:47:50.854
So bright.

447
00:47:51.054 --> 00:47:54.854
So beautiful.

448
00:47:55.025 --> 00:47:58.893
Our precious.

449
00:48:00.364 --> 00:48:01.854
What did you say?

450
00:48:02.065 --> 00:48:04.226
Master should be resting.

451
00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:08.461
Master needs to keep up his strength.

452
00:48:10.439 --> 00:48:13.704
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

453
00:48:13.876 --> 00:48:15.366
Gollum. Gollum.

454
00:48:15.545 --> 00:48:17.342
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

455
00:48:17.513 --> 00:48:21.609
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

456
00:48:21.784 --> 00:48:23.342
He said your life was a sad story.

457
00:48:23.553 --> 00:48:28.081
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

458
00:48:28.257 --> 00:48:31.249
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

459
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.189
Were you?

460
00:48:35.431 --> 00:48:37.661
Smeagol.

461
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.896
What did you call me?

462
00:48:46.242 --> 00:48:49.006
That was your name once, wasn't it?

463
00:48:49.579 --> 00:48:51.945
A long time ago.

464
00:48:52.782 --> 00:48:54.943
My name.

465
00:48:56.018 --> 00:48:57.508
My name.

466
00:49:04.393 --> 00:49:06.861
Smeagol.

467
00:49:10.999 --> 00:49:12.626
Black Riders!

468
00:49:12.801 --> 00:49:14.132
Hide! Hide!

469
00:49:24.713 --> 00:49:27.011
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

470
00:49:27.182 --> 00:49:30.811
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

471
00:49:31.586 --> 00:49:34.248
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

472
00:49:34.422 --> 00:49:37.391
No, you cannot kill them. No.

473
00:50:04.552 --> 00:50:05.644
Wraiths!

474
00:50:05.854 --> 00:50:08.049
Wraiths on wings!

475
00:50:16.063 --> 00:50:18.088
They are calling for it.

476
00:50:18.332 --> 00:50:21.859
They are calling for the precious.

477
00:50:24.004 --> 00:50:26.131
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

478
00:50:26.306 --> 00:50:27.568
I'm here.

479
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.114
Hurry, Hobbits.

480
00:50:45.693 --> 00:50:49.629
The Black Gate is very close.

481
00:50:56.503 --> 00:50:58.368
Orc blood.

482
00:51:08.315 --> 00:51:10.078
These are strange tracks.

483
00:51:11.351 --> 00:51:13.376
The air is so close in here.

484
00:51:14.521 --> 00:51:16.954
This forest is old.

485
00:51:17.757 --> 00:51:19.748
Very old.

486
00:51:21.527 --> 00:51:23.825
Full of memory...

487
00:51:26.432 --> 00:51:28.764
and anger.

488
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:37.842
The trees are speaking to each other.

489
00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:39.500
Gimli!

490
00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:41.613
Lower your ax.

491
00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:47.181
They have feelings, my friend.

492
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.711
The Elves began it.

493
00:51:49.922 --> 00:51:54.655
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

494
00:51:55.161 --> 00:51:57.527
Talking trees.

495
00:51:58.164 --> 00:52:01.190
What do trees have to talk about?

496
00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:04.530
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

497
00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.250
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nad no ennas!</i>
[English] A thing to be there!

498
00:52:16.035 --> 00:52:17.859
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What do you see?

499
00:52:18.484 --> 00:52:20.917
The White Wizard approaches.

500
00:52:27.125 --> 00:52:31.425
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

501
00:52:41.006 --> 00:52:43.270
We must be quick.

502
00:52:58.857 --> 00:53:02.486
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

503
00:53:03.061 --> 00:53:04.460
Where are they?

504
00:53:04.629 --> 00:53:08.190
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

505
00:53:08.366 --> 00:53:12.632
They met someone they did not expect.

506
00:53:12.804 --> 00:53:14.931
Does that comfort you?

507
00:53:15.106 --> 00:53:17.074
Who are you?

508
00:53:18.543 --> 00:53:20.511
Show yourself!

509
00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.411
It cannot be.

510
00:53:34.391 --> 00:53:35.358
Forgive me.

511
00:53:37.027 --> 00:53:38.961
I mistook you for Saruman.

512
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.494
I am Saruman.

513
00:53:44.034 --> 00:53:47.902
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

514
00:53:48.873 --> 00:53:50.363
You fell.

515
00:53:51.842 --> 00:53:54.367
Through fire...

516
00:53:54.545 --> 00:53:55.842
and water.

517
00:53:57.314 --> 00:53:59.839
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

518
00:54:00.017 --> 00:54:03.714
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

519
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.300
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

520
00:54:22.473 --> 00:54:26.932
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

521
00:54:32.949 --> 00:54:35.509
Darkness took me...

522
00:54:36.286 --> 00:54:40.347
and I strayed out of thought and time.

523
00:54:41.124 --> 00:54:44.184
Stars wheeled overhead...

524
00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:48.954
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

525
00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.227
But it was not the end.

526
00:54:53.469 --> 00:54:56.302
I felt life in me again.

527
00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:00.766
I've been sent back...

528
00:55:00.944 --> 00:55:02.502
until my task is done.

529
00:55:02.879 --> 00:55:04.779
Gandalf.

530
00:55:05.448 --> 00:55:07.439
Gandalf?

531
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:09.647
Yes.

532
00:55:12.455 --> 00:55:14.252
That was what they used to call me.

533
00:55:17.126 --> 00:55:19.390
Gandalf the Grey.

534
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:22.493
That was my name.

535
00:55:22.665 --> 00:55:24.098
Gandalf.

536
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:28.128
I am Gandalf the White.

537
00:55:31.173 --> 00:55:34.233
And I come back to you now...

538
00:55:34.409 --> 00:55:36.900
at the turn of the tide.

539
00:55:38.013 --> 00:55:40.982
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

540
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:44.913
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

541
00:55:45.854 --> 00:55:47.879
That is no short distance!

542
00:55:48.156 --> 00:55:51.387
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

543
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.653
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

544
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:57.265
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

545
00:55:57.432 --> 00:55:59.423
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

546
00:55:59.601 --> 00:56:03.765
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

547
00:56:06.375 --> 00:56:09.538
I mean, charming...

548
00:56:09.711 --> 00:56:12.441
quite charming forest.

549
00:56:12.981 --> 00:56:16.644
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

550
00:56:16.852 --> 00:56:21.221
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

551
00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:24.826
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

552
00:56:24.993 --> 00:56:28.326
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

553
00:56:28.497 --> 00:56:31.489
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

554
00:56:31.666 --> 00:56:35.260
You still speak in riddles.

555
00:56:38.105 --> 00:56:44.510
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

556
00:56:44.678 --> 00:56:48.307
The Ents are going to wake up...

557
00:56:48.849 --> 00:56:53.343
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

558
00:56:54.155 --> 00:56:55.281
Oh, that's good.

559
00:56:55.489 --> 00:56:58.185
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

560
00:56:59.293 --> 00:57:01.523
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

561
00:57:01.695 --> 00:57:05.290
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

562
00:57:05.466 --> 00:57:09.197
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

563
00:57:31.492 --> 00:57:32.925
That is one of the Mearas...

564
00:57:33.094 --> 00:57:35.891
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

565
00:57:53.513 --> 00:57:55.777
Shadowfax.

566
00:57:58.351 --> 00:58:00.979
He is the lord of all horses...

567
00:58:02.622 --> 00:58:06.490
and has been my friend through many dangers.

568
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.335
O rowan mine

569
00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:28.311
I saw you shine

570
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:32.008
Upon a summer's day

571
00:58:33.119 --> 00:58:37.579
Upon your head How golden-red

572
00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:42.522
The crown you bore aloft

573
00:58:42.694 --> 00:58:45.094
Such a beautiful verse.

574
00:58:45.264 --> 00:58:50.167
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

575
00:58:50.335 --> 00:58:53.600
You might call it far, perhaps.

576
00:58:54.506 --> 00:58:58.306
My home lies deep in the forest...

577
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:02.412
near the roots of the mountain.

578
00:59:03.682 --> 00:59:07.345
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

579
00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:11.545
And safe is where I'll keep you.

580
00:59:11.823 --> 00:59:16.192
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

581
00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:19.587
It's one of my own compositions.

582
00:59:19.765 --> 00:59:20.959
Right.

583
00:59:21.133 --> 00:59:27.265
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

584
00:59:27.439 --> 00:59:32.308
And the dreams of trees unfold

585
00:59:32.477 --> 00:59:38.939
When woodland halls are green and cool

586
00:59:39.151 --> 00:59:43.211
And the wind is in the West

587
00:59:43.688 --> 00:59:46.350
Come back to me

588
00:59:46.891 --> 00:59:51.351
Come back to me

589
00:59:51.529 --> 00:59:57.957
And say my land is best

590
01:00:05.409 --> 01:00:09.072
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:12.842
Heed no nightly noise.

592
01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:16.952
Sleep till morning light.

593
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:22.753
I have business in the forest.

594
01:00:22.927 --> 01:00:28.456
There are many to call. Many that must come.

595
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.364
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
01:00:34.538 --> 01:00:40.374
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

597
01:00:49.819 --> 01:00:54.085
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

598
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:57.485
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
01:00:57.927 --> 01:01:02.193
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:05.732
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

601
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:08.738
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
01:01:08.905 --> 01:01:11.465
The rumor has reached him.

603
01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:14.610
The heir of Numenor still lives.

604
01:01:15.578 --> 01:01:18.411
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
01:01:19.749 --> 01:01:21.910
He fears what you may become.

606
01:01:23.186 --> 01:01:26.622
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

607
01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:30.419
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

608
01:01:30.593 --> 01:01:32.083
War is coming.

609
01:01:32.262 --> 01:01:35.823
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

610
01:01:35.999 --> 01:01:38.433
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
01:01:38.601 --> 01:01:42.298
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
01:01:42.472 --> 01:01:45.566
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

613
01:01:45.742 --> 01:01:50.440
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

614
01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.407
But for all their cunning...

615
01:01:53.615 --> 01:01:56.140
we have one advantage.

616
01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.880
The Ring remains hidden.

617
01:02:01.924 --> 01:02:03.824
And that we should seek to destroy it...

618
01:02:03.992 --> 01:02:06.961
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

619
01:02:07.563 --> 01:02:10.862
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

620
01:02:11.033 --> 01:02:12.523
in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
01:02:12.701 --> 01:02:16.797
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
01:02:16.972 --> 01:02:19.600
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
01:02:19.775 --> 01:02:21.606
Everything depends upon speed...

624
01:02:21.777 --> 01:02:24.769
and the secrecy of his quest.

625
01:02:26.749 --> 01:02:30.082
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
01:02:30.953 --> 01:02:33.717
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
01:02:34.456 --> 01:02:36.788
He's not alone.

628
01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:38.654
Sam went with him.

629
01:02:39.328 --> 01:02:40.522
Did he?

630
01:02:40.696 --> 01:02:45.326
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:02:45.934 --> 01:02:48.368
Yes, very good.

632
01:02:56.377 --> 01:03:01.280
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:03:04.018 --> 01:03:06.486
Oh, save us.

634
01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:15.524
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

635
01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:22.225
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

636
01:03:22.403 --> 01:03:25.839
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

637
01:03:26.007 --> 01:03:27.235
I did.

638
01:03:36.017 --> 01:03:38.008
That's it, then.

639
01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:40.884
We can't get past that.

640
01:04:26.066 --> 01:04:27.397
Look!

641
01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:29.034
The gate.

642
01:04:29.202 --> 01:04:30.396
It's opening!

643
01:04:37.844 --> 01:04:39.812
I can see a way down.

644
01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:42.640
Sam, no!

645
01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:46.216
Master!

646
01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:13.528
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:06:14.305 --> 01:06:17.468
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

648
01:06:17.909 --> 01:06:19.774
- Now!
- No!

649
01:06:20.345 --> 01:06:22.313
No! No, master!

650
01:06:22.513 --> 01:06:25.482
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:06:26.784 --> 01:06:29.344
Don't take it to him.

652
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:35.020
He wants the precious.

653
01:06:35.193 --> 01:06:38.219
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:06:38.396 --> 01:06:42.298
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

655
01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:46.435
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:06:52.844 --> 01:06:54.937
No! There's another way.

657
01:06:55.146 --> 01:06:57.808
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:06:58.116 --> 01:07:01.779
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

659
01:07:02.253 --> 01:07:03.276
He's up to something.

660
01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:06.481
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

661
01:07:06.657 --> 01:07:09.387
Yes. There's a path...

662
01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:12.050
and some stairs.

663
01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:13.923
And then...

664
01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:17.430
a tunnel.

665
01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.245
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:34.816
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:07:35.952 --> 01:07:37.419
He's been true to his word.

668
01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:43.486
No.

669
01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.256
Lead the way, Smeagol.

670
01:07:47.864 --> 01:07:51.800
Good Smeagol always helps.

671
01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.757
Hello?

672
01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:31.230
Treebeard?

673
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.272
Where has he gone?

674
01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:35.910
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:39.241
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

676
01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.906
And we smoked all of it. And then...

677
01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.352
you were sick.

678
01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:48.788
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.228
Did you hear that?

680
01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.702
There it is again.

681
01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:08.235
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

682
01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.981
You just said something... Treeish.

683
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:19.143
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.559
You're taller.

685
01:09:29.097 --> 01:09:30.587
- Who?
- You!

686
01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:32.392
- Than what?
- Than me!

687
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:35.028
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:39.833
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

689
01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:42.198
Please, Merry.

690
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:46.244
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:49.648
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

692
01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:54.050
3'8"!

693
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:57.821
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:10:00.895 --> 01:10:02.795
You did something.

695
01:10:08.603 --> 01:10:10.195
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:10:11.139 --> 01:10:12.605
Merry!

697
01:10:12.806 --> 01:10:15.138
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

698
01:10:15.309 --> 01:10:19.211
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

699
01:10:19.379 --> 01:10:21.540
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:10:23.383 --> 01:10:24.748
What's happening?!

701
01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.086
It's got my leg!

702
01:10:27.421 --> 01:10:28.911
Merry!

703
01:10:48.308 --> 01:10:49.900
Help!

704
01:10:56.683 --> 01:10:58.548
Away with you.

705
01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:00.516
You should not be waking.

706
01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:05.890
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

707
01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:09.053
Go to sleep.

708
01:11:09.396 --> 01:11:11.261
Away with you.

709
01:11:11.431 --> 01:11:14.730
Come, the forest is waking up.

710
01:11:15.302 --> 01:11:17.235
It isn't safe.

711
01:11:19.906 --> 01:11:23.842
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

712
01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.002
Anger festers in their hearts.

713
01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.507
Black are their thoughts.

714
01:11:29.682 --> 01:11:32.207
Strong is their hate.

715
01:11:32.385 --> 01:11:35.149
They will harm you if they can.

716
01:11:35.321 --> 01:11:38.882
There are too few of us now.

717
01:11:39.058 --> 01:11:43.051
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

718
01:11:43.696 --> 01:11:46.324
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

719
01:11:46.499 --> 01:11:49.696
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

720
01:11:49.869 --> 01:11:55.501
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

721
01:11:55.708 --> 01:12:00.941
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

722
01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:02.612
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
01:12:02.715 --> 01:12:06.651
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

724
01:12:06.819 --> 01:12:10.050
We lost them.

725
01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:15.285
And now we cannot find them.

726
01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:21.695
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

727
01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.648
Can't say that I have.

728
01:12:25.192 --> 01:12:27.217
You, Pip?

729
01:12:28.695 --> 01:12:31.095
What do they look like?

730
01:12:33.533 --> 01:12:38.197
I don't remember now.

731
01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:58.273
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

732
01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.670
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

733
01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:05.246
whose mind is overthrown.

734
01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:09.681
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

735
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.483
My lord, your son...

736
01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:15.852
he is dead.

737
01:13:17.361 --> 01:13:19.158
My lord?

738
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:21.590
Uncle?

739
01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.668
Will you not go to him?

740
01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:36.209
Will you do nothing?

741
01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:38.347
Be careful what you say.

742
01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:40.708
Do not look for welcome here.

743
01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.904
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

744
01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.238
What a tragedy for the king...

745
01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.449
to lose his only son and heir.

746
01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:20.079
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

747
01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:25.158
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

748
01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:26.793
Leave me alone, snake!

749
01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.890
Oh, but you are alone.

750
01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:36.300
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

751
01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:39.929
in the bitter watches of the night...

752
01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:43.771
when all your life seems to shrink.

753
01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:48.176
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

754
01:14:48.349 --> 01:14:52.911
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

755
01:14:55.156 --> 01:14:57.056
So fair.

756
01:14:58.326 --> 01:14:59.691
So cold.

757
01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.624
Like a morning of pale spring...

758
01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:07.268
still clinging to winter's chill.

759
01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:23.540
Your words are poison.

760
01:16:56.108 --> 01:16:58.576
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

761
01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:16.725
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

762
01:17:18.231 --> 01:17:20.791
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

763
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:39.912
Your staff.

764
01:17:43.321 --> 01:17:46.813
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

765
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.477
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

766
01:18:16.788 --> 01:18:18.346
He's a herald of woe.

767
01:18:18.523 --> 01:18:22.960
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

768
01:18:24.062 --> 01:18:25.495
Theoden King.

769
01:18:26.197 --> 01:18:28.722
He's not welcome.

770
01:18:29.668 --> 01:18:35.004
Why should I welcome you...

771
01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:39.169
Gandalf Stormcrow?

772
01:18:39.343 --> 01:18:42.642
A just question, my liege.

773
01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:45.680
Late is the hour...

774
01:18:45.849 --> 01:18:49.808
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

775
01:18:50.621 --> 01:18:52.680
Lathspell I name him.

776
01:18:52.856 --> 01:18:55.757
Ill news is an ill guest.

777
01:18:55.926 --> 01:19:00.488
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

778
01:19:00.664 --> 01:19:02.598
I have not passed through fire and death...

779
01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.931
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

780
01:19:06.937 --> 01:19:09.030
His staff.

781
01:19:09.239 --> 01:19:13.369
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

782
01:19:16.714 --> 01:19:18.648
Theoden...

783
01:19:19.216 --> 01:19:21.776
son of Thengel...

784
01:19:23.554 --> 01:19:25.920
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

785
01:19:28.892 --> 01:19:32.157
I would stay still if I were you.

786
01:19:32.329 --> 01:19:34.422
Hearken to me!

787
01:19:39.937 --> 01:19:42.063
I release you...

788
01:19:42.271 --> 01:19:44.239
from the spell.

789
01:19:55.785 --> 01:19:58.811
You have no power here...

790
01:19:58.988 --> 01:20:02.617
Gandalf the Grey.

791
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:13.093
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

792
01:20:22.545 --> 01:20:24.069
Wait.

793
01:20:25.515 --> 01:20:29.349
If I go, Theoden dies.

794
01:20:30.052 --> 01:20:32.247
You did not kill me...

795
01:20:32.422 --> 01:20:34.617
you will not kill him.

796
01:20:38.528 --> 01:20:40.223
Rohan is mine.

797
01:20:41.697 --> 01:20:43.028
Be gone.

798
01:21:27.542 --> 01:21:29.669
I know your face.

799
01:21:34.249 --> 01:21:35.511
Eowyn.

800
01:21:37.819 --> 01:21:39.081
Eowyn.

801
01:21:47.361 --> 01:21:48.555
Gandalf?

802
01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:51.963
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

803
01:22:05.312 --> 01:22:07.906
Dark have been my dreams of late.

804
01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:15.818
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

805
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:18.959
if they grasped your sword.

806
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:06.038
I've only...

807
01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:09.299
ever served you, my lord.

808
01:23:09.475 --> 01:23:14.469
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

809
01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:17.415
Send me not from your sight.

810
01:23:19.719 --> 01:23:22.449
No, my lord! No, my lord.

811
01:23:22.655 --> 01:23:23.849
Let him go.

812
01:23:24.557 --> 01:23:27.788
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

813
01:23:36.936 --> 01:23:39.268
Get out of my way!

814
01:23:41.507 --> 01:23:44.670
Hail, Theoden King!

815
01:24:09.267 --> 01:24:11.758
Where is Theodred?

816
01:24:14.806 --> 01:24:17.366
Where is my son?

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:01.877
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

825
01:26:03.947 --> 01:26:07.815
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

826
01:26:08.585 --> 01:26:12.988
The young perish and the old linger.

827
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:15.683
That I should live...

828
01:26:15.859 --> 01:26:19.226
to see the last days of my house.

829
01:26:20.497 --> 01:26:24.365
Theodred's death was not of your making.

830
01:26:27.403 --> 01:26:30.804
No parent should have to bury their child.

831
01:26:47.524 --> 01:26:49.389
He was strong in life.

832
01:26:50.493 --> 01:26:54.054
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

[English] Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.

835
01:27:38.674 --> 01:27:40.574
They had no warning.

836
01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:43.142
They were unarmed.

837
01:27:43.612 --> 01:27:47.639
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

838
01:27:48.584 --> 01:27:50.552
Rick, cot and tree.

839
01:27:50.853 --> 01:27:53.083
Where is Mama?

840
01:27:53.856 --> 01:27:58.088
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

841
01:27:58.293 --> 01:28:02.627
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

842
01:28:04.233 --> 01:28:07.201
Ride out and meet him head on.

843
01:28:07.969 --> 01:28:11.461
Draw him away from your women and children.

844
01:28:11.806 --> 01:28:13.433
You must fight.

845
01:28:13.608 --> 01:28:17.442
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

846
01:28:17.612 --> 01:28:19.239
Eomer is loyal to you.

847
01:28:19.413 --> 01:28:22.109
His men will return and fight for their king.

848
01:28:22.283 --> 01:28:26.185
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

849
01:28:29.857 --> 01:28:32.087
Eomer cannot help us.

850
01:28:32.727 --> 01:28:34.490
I know what it is you want of me...

851
01:28:34.695 --> 01:28:37.960
but I will not bring further death to my people.

852
01:28:39.634 --> 01:28:41.329
I will not risk open war.

853
01:28:43.537 --> 01:28:46.904
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

854
01:28:51.178 --> 01:28:52.805
When last I looked...

855
01:28:53.247 --> 01:28:56.876
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

856
01:29:03.691 --> 01:29:05.955
Then what is the king's decision?

857
01:29:11.564 --> 01:29:12.895
By order of the king...

858
01:29:13.066 --> 01:29:14.533
the city must empty.

859
01:29:15.702 --> 01:29:18.569
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

860
01:29:18.872 --> 01:29:22.774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

861
01:29:22.976 --> 01:29:24.466
Helm's Deep.

862
01:29:24.644 --> 01:29:28.171
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

863
01:29:28.348 --> 01:29:30.316
Who will defend them if not their king?

864
01:29:30.483 --> 01:29:32.951
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

865
01:29:33.119 --> 01:29:34.916
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

866
01:29:35.088 --> 01:29:38.990
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

867
01:29:39.192 --> 01:29:41.353
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

868
01:29:41.561 --> 01:29:43.688
What they will get is a massacre.

869
01:29:45.265 --> 01:29:47.733
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

870
01:29:48.635 --> 01:29:51.968
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

871
01:29:52.439 --> 01:29:55.306
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

872
01:29:55.775 --> 01:29:58.573
The people of Rohan will need you.

873
01:29:58.945 --> 01:30:01.413
The defenses have to hold.

874
01:30:02.849 --> 01:30:04.578
They will hold.

875
01:30:08.588 --> 01:30:10.886
The Grey Pilgrim.

876
01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:13.684
That's what they used to call me.

877
01:30:13.892 --> 01:30:18.955
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

878
01:30:20.599 --> 01:30:22.794
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

879
01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:26.634
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

880
01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:30.202
At dawn, look to the east.

881
01:30:30.376 --> 01:30:31.934
Go.

882
01:30:59.271 --> 01:31:02.604
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

883
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
[Rohirric] <i>Fæste.</i>
[English] Fast.

884
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
[Rohirric] <i>Stille nú.</i>
[English] Calm now.

885
01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.900
[Rohirric] <i>Fæste.</i>
[English] Fast.

886
01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.400
[Rohirric] <i>Stille.</i>
[English] Calm.

887
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.800
[Rohirric] <i>Stille.</i>
[English] Calm.

888
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
[Rohirric] <i>Stille.</i>
[English] Calm.

889
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.300
[Rohirric] <i>Lac is drefed, gefrægon.</i>
[English] A battle is stirred up, they heard.

890
01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.000
[Rohirric] <i>Hwæt nemnað ðe?</i>
[English] What is your name?

891
01:31:41.646 --> 01:31:43.705
His name is Brego.

892
01:31:45.216 --> 01:31:47.116
He was my cousin's horse.

893
01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:49.148
Brego.

894
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:52.100
[Rohirric] <i>Ðin nama is cynglic.</i>
[English] Your name is kingly.

895
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.300
[Sindarin] <i>Man le trasta, Brego?</i>
[English] What troubles you, Brego?

896
01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:03.000
[Sindarin] <i>Man cenich?</i>
[English] What did you see?

897
01:32:03.868 --> 01:32:06.268
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

898
01:32:06.437 --> 01:32:09.736
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

899
01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:13.209
You speak as one of their own.

900
01:32:15.012 --> 01:32:17.446
I was raised in Rivendell...

901
01:32:17.715 --> 01:32:19.238
for a time.

902
01:32:22.552 --> 01:32:24.577
Turn this fellow free.

903
01:32:25.255 --> 01:32:27.723
He's seen enough of war.

904
01:32:39.503 --> 01:32:42.370
Gandalf the White.

905
01:32:42.539 --> 01:32:44.905
Gandalf the Fool!

906
01:32:46.176 --> 01:32:50.237
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

907
01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:55.417
There were three who followed the wizard.

908
01:32:55.819 --> 01:33:01.189
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

909
01:33:01.558 --> 01:33:04.288
You stink of horse.

910
01:33:09.566 --> 01:33:11.431
The Man...

911
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:17.668
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

912
01:33:17.841 --> 01:33:21.640
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

913
01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.607
His cloth was poor.

914
01:33:24.513 --> 01:33:29.644
And yet he bore a strange ring.

915
01:33:30.753 --> 01:33:34.280
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

916
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:40.326
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

917
01:33:40.496 --> 01:33:42.396
The Ring of Barahir.

918
01:33:43.365 --> 01:33:46.960
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

919
01:33:47.136 --> 01:33:50.469
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

920
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:53.369
The line was broken years ago.

921
01:33:54.743 --> 01:33:56.267
It matters not.

922
01:33:56.445 --> 01:33:58.970
The world of Men shall fall.

923
01:33:59.148 --> 01:34:01.013
It will begin at Edoras.

924
01:34:10.192 --> 01:34:12.126
I am ready, Gamling.

925
01:34:12.294 --> 01:34:14.762
Bring my horse.

926
01:34:17.933 --> 01:34:19.298
This is not a defeat.

927
01:34:21.704 --> 01:34:22.932
We will return.

928
01:34:28.376 --> 01:34:30.776
We will return.

929
01:34:54.202 --> 01:34:56.136
You have some skill with a blade.

930
01:35:04.579 --> 01:35:06.672
Women of this country learned long ago:

931
01:35:06.848 --> 01:35:09.476
Those without swords can still die upon them.

932
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:11.482
I fear neither death nor pain.

933
01:35:12.754 --> 01:35:14.847
What do you fear, my lady?

934
01:35:18.259 --> 01:35:20.090
A cage.

935
01:35:21.396 --> 01:35:25.230
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

936
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:29.301
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

937
01:35:32.739 --> 01:35:34.764
You're a daughter of kings...

938
01:35:36.043 --> 01:35:39.342
a shield maiden of Rohan.

939
01:35:44.651 --> 01:35:47.142
I do not think that would be your fate.

940
01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.212
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

941
01:36:23.423 --> 01:36:25.482
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

942
01:36:25.692 --> 01:36:28.593
He will expect an attack on the city.

943
01:36:29.896 --> 01:36:33.160
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

944
01:36:33.332 --> 01:36:35.664
the great fortress of Rohan.

945
01:36:36.869 --> 01:36:41.272
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

946
01:36:42.708 --> 01:36:44.437
They will be slow.

947
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:49.247
They will have women and children with them.

948
01:36:53.152 --> 01:36:55.382
Send out your Warg-riders.

949
01:37:10.236 --> 01:37:13.137
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

950
01:37:13.305 --> 01:37:15.967
- Why do you do that?
- What?

951
01:37:16.142 --> 01:37:18.667
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

952
01:37:19.111 --> 01:37:21.136
Because.

953
01:37:22.681 --> 01:37:24.808
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

954
01:37:25.017 --> 01:37:27.178
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

955
01:37:27.653 --> 01:37:30.417
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

956
01:37:30.589 --> 01:37:32.853
You have no idea what it did to him...

957
01:37:33.025 --> 01:37:35.492
what it's still doing to him.

958
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:39.822
I want to help him, Sam.

959
01:37:39.998 --> 01:37:41.260
Why?

960
01:37:46.571 --> 01:37:49.699
Because I have to believe he can come back.

961
01:37:53.945 --> 01:37:55.879
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

962
01:37:56.047 --> 01:37:58.777
What do you know about it? Nothing!

963
01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:09.888
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

964
01:38:10.728 --> 01:38:11.854
I do.

965
01:38:13.898 --> 01:38:15.763
It's the Ring.

966
01:38:16.334 --> 01:38:17.892
You can't take your eyes off it.

967
01:38:18.636 --> 01:38:20.604
I've seen you.

968
01:38:21.072 --> 01:38:24.906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

969
01:38:26.678 --> 01:38:28.908
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

970
01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:31.776
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

971
01:38:31.983 --> 01:38:34.918
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

972
01:38:35.086 --> 01:38:36.781
Mine! My own!

973
01:38:37.654 --> 01:38:39.747
Can't you hear yourself?

974
01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:41.618
Don't you know who you sound like?

975
01:38:51.902 --> 01:38:54.029
We wants it.

976
01:38:54.204 --> 01:38:56.900
We needs it.

977
01:38:57.074 --> 01:39:01.875
Must have the precious.

978
01:39:02.045 --> 01:39:05.412
They stole it from us.

979
01:39:05.616 --> 01:39:08.983
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

980
01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:13.054
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

981
01:39:13.223 --> 01:39:16.488
No. Not master.

982
01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:20.494
Yes, precious. False.

983
01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:25.158
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

984
01:39:26.303 --> 01:39:28.771
Master's my friend.

985
01:39:28.939 --> 01:39:34.002
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

986
01:39:35.279 --> 01:39:37.770
Not listening. I'm not listening.

987
01:39:37.948 --> 01:39:41.940
You're a liar and a thief.

988
01:39:42.618 --> 01:39:44.142
No.

989
01:39:45.087 --> 01:39:47.988
Murderer.

990
01:39:50.459 --> 01:39:51.483
Go away.

991
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:54.027
Go away?

992
01:39:56.032 --> 01:39:58.830
I hate you.

993
01:39:59.001 --> 01:40:01.401
I hate you.

994
01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:05.003
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

995
01:40:05.174 --> 01:40:07.005
I saved us.

996
01:40:07.176 --> 01:40:11.704
It was me. We survived because of me.

997
01:40:12.949 --> 01:40:16.510
Not anymore.

998
01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.411
What did you say?

999
01:40:21.524 --> 01:40:25.358
Master looks after us now.

1000
01:40:25.528 --> 01:40:29.020
We don't need you.

1001
01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:31.290
What?

1002
01:40:31.467 --> 01:40:33.230
Leave now...

1003
01:40:33.402 --> 01:40:37.202
and never come back.

1004
01:40:37.373 --> 01:40:38.397
No.

1005
01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:43.106
Leave now and never come back.

1006
01:40:45.747 --> 01:40:51.652
Leave now and never come back!

1007
01:41:03.565 --> 01:41:06.261
We told him to go away.

1008
01:41:06.434 --> 01:41:09.403
And away he goes, precious.

1009
01:41:09.571 --> 01:41:11.562
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1010
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:13.571
Smeagol is free!

1011
01:41:18.446 --> 01:41:19.936
Look.

1012
01:41:20.148 --> 01:41:24.608
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

1013
01:41:34.162 --> 01:41:35.595
They are young.

1014
01:41:35.764 --> 01:41:38.289
They are tender. They are nice.

1015
01:41:38.466 --> 01:41:41.993
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1016
01:41:44.706 --> 01:41:46.298
You'll make him sick, you will...

1017
01:41:47.508 --> 01:41:49.703
behaving like that.

1018
01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:54.876
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

1019
01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:00.643
What's it doing?

1020
01:42:01.388 --> 01:42:03.982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1021
01:42:04.158 --> 01:42:06.353
It ruins it.

1022
01:42:06.527 --> 01:42:10.156
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1023
01:42:14.301 --> 01:42:16.861
What we need is a few good taters.

1024
01:42:17.738 --> 01:42:20.798
What's taters, precious?

1025
01:42:20.974 --> 01:42:22.703
What's taters? Eh?

1026
01:42:22.876 --> 01:42:24.605
Po-ta-toes.

1027
01:42:24.945 --> 01:42:28.176
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1028
01:42:29.717 --> 01:42:35.178
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1029
01:42:36.523 --> 01:42:38.423
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1030
01:42:38.759 --> 01:42:40.954
Oh, yes, we could.

1031
01:42:41.128 --> 01:42:44.620
Spoil a nice fish.

1032
01:42:45.899 --> 01:42:48.527
Give it to us raw...

1033
01:42:48.702 --> 01:42:51.727
and wriggling.

1034
01:42:51.904 --> 01:42:55.032
You keep nasty chips.

1035
01:42:55.975 --> 01:42:58.034
You're hopeless.

1036
01:43:10.523 --> 01:43:12.013
Mr. Frodo?

1037
01:43:29.909 --> 01:43:32.571
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1038
01:43:32.779 --> 01:43:35.247
Servants of Sauron.

1039
01:43:36.048 --> 01:43:38.209
They are called to Mordor.

1040
01:43:38.417 --> 01:43:41.409
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1041
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:44.784
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

1042
01:43:46.359 --> 01:43:50.022
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1043
01:43:50.196 --> 01:43:55.360
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

1044
01:43:55.634 --> 01:43:58.694
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1045
01:43:58.870 --> 01:44:00.098
Mr. Frodo.

1046
01:44:00.605 --> 01:44:02.232
Look.

1047
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.109
It's an oliphaunt.

1048
01:44:16.321 --> 01:44:19.347
No one at home will believe this.

1049
01:44:30.502 --> 01:44:32.367
Smeagol?

1050
01:45:12.743 --> 01:45:15.211
We've lingered here too long.

1051
01:45:18.215 --> 01:45:19.546
Come on, Sam.

1052
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:35.726
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1053
01:45:37.434 --> 01:45:42.531
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1054
01:45:42.706 --> 01:45:45.607
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1055
01:45:47.011 --> 01:45:50.378
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1056
01:45:50.547 --> 01:45:52.572
The enemy?

1057
01:45:54.685 --> 01:45:58.177
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1058
01:46:00.623 --> 01:46:02.682
You wonder what his name is...

1059
01:46:04.193 --> 01:46:06.457
where he came from.

1060
01:46:08.431 --> 01:46:10.865
And if he was really evil at heart.

1061
01:46:12.535 --> 01:46:15.993
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1062
01:46:17.607 --> 01:46:20.098
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1063
01:46:22.312 --> 01:46:23.802
in peace.

1064
01:46:27.383 --> 01:46:30.409
War will make corpses of us all.

1065
01:46:30.586 --> 01:46:32.645
Bind their hands.

1066
01:46:46.384 --> 01:46:49.080
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

1067
01:46:49.287 --> 01:46:52.950
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1068
01:46:53.124 --> 01:46:56.286
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

1069
01:46:56.693 --> 01:46:58.593
It's the beards.

1070
01:46:58.795 --> 01:47:00.923
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

1071
01:47:01.098 --> 01:47:03.966
that there are no Dwarf women...

1072
01:47:04.134 --> 01:47:08.401
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

1073
01:47:10.073 --> 01:47:11.938
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1074
01:47:18.081 --> 01:47:20.311
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1075
01:47:20.784 --> 01:47:22.809
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

1076
01:47:24.754 --> 01:47:28.554
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

1077
01:47:28.824 --> 01:47:31.589
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

1078
01:47:31.761 --> 01:47:34.060
Cut down by Orcs.

1079
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:37.223
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

1080
01:47:37.834 --> 01:47:42.463
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

1081
01:47:42.638 --> 01:47:47.200
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

1082
01:47:57.219 --> 01:47:59.585
Gimli.

1083
01:47:59.755 --> 01:48:01.814
No, I couldn't

1084
01:48:01.991 --> 01:48:03.822
I really couldn't.

1085
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:09.957
I made some stew.

1086
01:48:10.131 --> 01:48:13.397
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1087
01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:23.268
Thank you.

1088
01:48:43.764 --> 01:48:46.290
- It's good.
- Really?

1089
01:48:50.271 --> 01:48:53.638
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1090
01:48:54.942 --> 01:48:59.003
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1091
01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:01.915
But he must be mistaken.

1092
01:49:02.182 --> 01:49:06.586
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

1093
01:49:07.721 --> 01:49:10.919
Then you must be at least 60.

1094
01:49:13.027 --> 01:49:14.585
Seventy?

1095
01:49:15.029 --> 01:49:16.691
But you cannot be 80!

1096
01:49:20.034 --> 01:49:21.399
Eighty-seven.

1097
01:49:24.505 --> 01:49:26.598
You are one of the Dunedain.

1098
01:49:27.674 --> 01:49:30.768
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

1099
01:49:32.012 --> 01:49:34.640
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

1100
01:49:35.315 --> 01:49:37.078
There are few of us left.

1101
01:49:37.252 --> 01:49:40.014
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

1102
01:49:40.788 --> 01:49:44.189
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1103
01:49:58.839 --> 01:50:02.968
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

1104
01:50:03.776 --> 01:50:07.212
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1105
01:50:09.048 --> 01:50:11.448
Like my heart.

1106
01:50:12.885 --> 01:50:15.581
Go to sleep.

1107
01:50:15.755 --> 01:50:18.246
I am asleep.

1108
01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:26.664
This is a dream.

1109
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.098
Then it is a good dream.

1110
01:50:44.083 --> 01:50:46.175
Sleep.

1111
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.882
[Sindarin] <i>Minlû pedich nin...</i>
[English] Once you told me...

1112
01:51:14.994 --> 01:51:17.180
[Sindarin] <i>...i aur hen telitha.</i>
[English] ...this day will-come.

1113
01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.726
[Sindarin] <i>Ú i vethed... nâ i onnad.</i>
[English] Not the end... it is the beginning.

1114
01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.600
[Sindarin] <i>Boe bedich go Frodo.</i>
[English] It is necessary you go with Frodo.

1115
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.600
[Sindarin] <i>Han bâd lîn.</i>
It is your path.

1116
01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:38.600
[Sindarin] <i>Dolen i vâd o nin.</i>
[English] Hidden the path is from me.

1117
01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:42.600
[Sindarin] <i>Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn.</i>
[English] The way is already spread before your feet.

1118
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.435
[Sindarin] <i>Si boe ú-dhannathach.</i>
[English] Now it-is-necessary you-don’t-fall.

1119
01:51:49.396 --> 01:51:51.295
Arwen...

1120
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.500
[Sindarin] <i>Ae ú-esteliach nad...</i>
[English] If you trust not things...

1121
01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:58.729
[Sindarin] <i>...estelio han...</i>
[English] ...trust this...

1122
01:51:59.055 --> 01:52:02.088
[Sindarin] <i>...estelio ammen.</i>
[English] ...trust us.

1123
01:52:40.496 --> 01:52:42.327
Where is she?

1124
01:52:43.499 --> 01:52:45.933
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1125
01:52:49.239 --> 01:52:52.002
Our time here is ending.

1126
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:55.233
Arwen's time is ending.

1127
01:52:56.012 --> 01:52:57.273
Let her go.

1128
01:52:57.447 --> 01:52:59.437
Let her take the ship into the west.

1129
01:52:59.649 --> 01:53:02.709
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

1130
01:53:02.885 --> 01:53:04.682
There it will be ever green.

1131
01:53:06.188 --> 01:53:08.554
But never more than memory.

1132
01:53:09.825 --> 01:53:12.851
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1133
01:53:13.028 --> 01:53:16.657
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1134
01:53:16.832 --> 01:53:19.130
She belongs with her people.

1135
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:33.931
[Sindarin] <i>Nach gwannatha sin?</i>
[English] Are you going to leave in such way?

1136
01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.318
[Sindarin] <i>Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened?</i>
[English] You would depart after the stars fade - unseen?

1137
01:53:40.724 --> 01:53:42.300
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-ethelithon.</i>
[English] I will not return.

1138
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.400
[Sindarin] <i>Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.</i>
[English] Trust in your skill in battle.

1139
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:47.300
[Sindarin] <i>Ethelithach.</i>
[English] You will return.

1140
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.100
[Sindarin] <i> Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.</i>
[English] I don’t speak about death in battle.

1141
01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.400
[Sindarin] <i>O man pedich?</i>
[English] About what you speak?

1142
01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.939
[Sindarin] <i>Edra le men, men na guil edwen...</i>
[English] A path is opened for you, a path to another life...

1143
01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.200
[Sindarin] <i>haer o auth a nîr a naeth.</i>
[English] ...far from war and weeping and woe.

1144
01:54:07.448 --> 01:54:09.279
Why are you saying this?

1145
01:54:10.851 --> 01:54:14.048
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1146
01:54:15.489 --> 01:54:18.151
It was a dream, Arwen.

1147
01:54:18.592 --> 01:54:19.956
Nothing more.

1148
01:54:21.329 --> 01:54:24.559
I don't believe you.

1149
01:54:33.574 --> 01:54:35.404
This belongs to you.

1150
01:54:38.178 --> 01:54:39.736
It was a gift.

1151
01:54:42.349 --> 01:54:43.873
Keep it.

1152
01:54:46.386 --> 01:54:47.581
My lord?

1153
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:54.952
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1154
01:55:18.451 --> 01:55:19.917
What is it?

1155
01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:23.479
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1156
01:55:40.005 --> 01:55:42.029
Wargs!

1157
01:55:54.586 --> 01:55:56.281
A scout!

1158
01:56:02.593 --> 01:56:05.118
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1159
01:56:06.464 --> 01:56:08.659
Get them out of here!

1160
01:56:13.438 --> 01:56:15.429
All riders to the head of the column.

1161
01:56:16.174 --> 01:56:18.143
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1162
01:56:18.342 --> 01:56:20.071
Come on!

1163
01:56:31.889 --> 01:56:34.322
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1164
01:56:34.524 --> 01:56:35.992
- I can fight.
- No!

1165
01:56:38.696 --> 01:56:40.755
You must do this, for me.

1166
01:56:42.767 --> 01:56:44.359
Follow me!

1167
01:56:47.905 --> 01:56:52.204
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1168
01:56:52.409 --> 01:56:55.072
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1169
01:58:07.282 --> 01:58:09.581
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1170
01:58:12.388 --> 01:58:13.945
That one counts as mine!

1171
01:58:30.672 --> 01:58:32.299
Stinking creature.

1172
01:59:59.493 --> 02:00:01.392
Aragorn!

1173
02:00:06.132 --> 02:00:07.599
Aragorn?

1174
02:00:21.579 --> 02:00:24.514
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

1175
02:00:24.684 --> 02:00:26.116
He's...

1176
02:00:26.686 --> 02:00:28.278
dead.

1177
02:00:28.921 --> 02:00:31.821
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1178
02:00:35.427 --> 02:00:36.724
You lie.

1179
02:01:10.628 --> 02:01:12.220
Get the wounded on horses.

1180
02:01:13.565 --> 02:01:16.692
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1181
02:01:17.134 --> 02:01:19.227
Leave the dead.

1182
02:01:26.677 --> 02:01:28.167
Come.

1183
02:01:38.356 --> 02:01:39.879
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1184
02:01:40.058 --> 02:01:42.958
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1185
02:01:45.528 --> 02:01:47.326
We're safe!

1186
02:01:48.866 --> 02:01:51.733
We're safe, my lady.

1187
02:01:51.901 --> 02:01:53.096
Thank you.

1188
02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:38.879
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1189
02:02:39.047 --> 02:02:40.538
Freda!

1190
02:02:46.288 --> 02:02:49.122
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1191
02:02:52.995 --> 02:02:54.291
Take it to the caves.

1192
02:02:54.496 --> 02:02:57.329
Make way for the king.

1193
02:02:58.366 --> 02:03:02.166
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

1194
02:03:10.078 --> 02:03:13.809
So few. So few of you have returned.

1195
02:03:16.584 --> 02:03:18.849
Our people are safe.

1196
02:03:20.187 --> 02:03:22.748
We have paid for it with many lives.

1197
02:03:23.591 --> 02:03:25.116
My lady.

1198
02:03:28.863 --> 02:03:31.127
Lord Aragorn...

1199
02:03:31.299 --> 02:03:32.527
where is he?

1200
02:03:34.535 --> 02:03:36.060
He fell.

1201
02:03:58.725 --> 02:04:01.695
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1202
02:04:01.862 --> 02:04:04.797
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

1203
02:04:05.032 --> 02:04:08.125
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1204
02:04:08.302 --> 02:04:10.896
Get them into the caves.

1205
02:04:11.772 --> 02:04:16.640
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1206
02:04:18.679 --> 02:04:22.080
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1207
02:04:22.248 --> 02:04:24.581
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1208
02:04:24.751 --> 02:04:27.846
but for a small culvert at its base...

1209
02:04:28.021 --> 02:04:30.785
which is little more than a drain.

1210
02:04:33.660 --> 02:04:37.824
How? How can fire undo stone?

1211
02:04:37.998 --> 02:04:42.491
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

1212
02:04:46.104 --> 02:04:50.098
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

1213
02:04:50.275 --> 02:04:53.802
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

1214
02:04:53.980 --> 02:04:56.540
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1215
02:04:56.716 --> 02:04:58.148
Tens of thousands.

1216
02:04:58.317 --> 02:05:02.378
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1217
02:05:14.333 --> 02:05:17.427
A new power is rising.

1218
02:05:17.602 --> 02:05:20.594
Its victory is at hand.

1219
02:05:26.279 --> 02:05:28.336
This night...

1220
02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:33.113
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

1221
02:05:33.285 --> 02:05:36.618
March to Helm's Deep!

1222
02:05:36.788 --> 02:05:40.224
Leave none alive!

1223
02:05:42.761 --> 02:05:45.228
To war!

1224
02:05:49.166 --> 02:05:53.627
There will be no dawn for Men.

1225
02:06:10.822 --> 02:06:12.879
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1226
02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:16.218
There is always smoke rising...

1227
02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:20.294
from Isengard these days.

1228
02:06:20.531 --> 02:06:22.123
Isengard?

1229
02:06:22.333 --> 02:06:24.198
There was a time...

1230
02:06:24.535 --> 02:06:28.061
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1231
02:06:28.238 --> 02:06:31.606
But now he has a mind of metal...

1232
02:06:32.276 --> 02:06:34.709
and wheels.

1233
02:06:35.479 --> 02:06:39.973
He no longer cares for growing things.

1234
02:06:40.150 --> 02:06:41.947
What is it?

1235
02:06:46.956 --> 02:06:49.151
It's Saruman's army.

1236
02:06:49.359 --> 02:06:50.883
The war has started.

1237
02:07:29.264 --> 02:07:33.633
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

1238
02:08:05.901 --> 02:08:07.765
Brego.

1239
02:08:34.144 --> 02:08:35.339
Arwen.

1240
02:08:36.300 --> 02:08:38.300
[Sindarin] <i>Tollen, i lû.</i>
[English] Come, it is time.

1241
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:44.100
[Sindarin] <i>I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.</i>
[English] The ships depart to Valinor. Now go, before they sail.

1242
02:08:44.872 --> 02:08:46.668
I have made my choice.

1243
02:08:53.113 --> 02:08:55.980
He is not coming back.

1244
02:08:57.417 --> 02:09:00.750
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

1245
02:09:01.688 --> 02:09:04.658
There is still hope.

1246
02:09:08.828 --> 02:09:12.594
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

1247
02:09:16.002 --> 02:09:18.971
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

1248
02:09:19.139 --> 02:09:21.630
and all that you hope for comes true...

1249
02:09:21.808 --> 02:09:26.506
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1250
02:09:26.779 --> 02:09:29.772
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

1251
02:09:29.949 --> 02:09:32.919
Aragorn will die.

1252
02:09:35.755 --> 02:09:38.280
And there will be no comfort for you...

1253
02:09:38.491 --> 02:09:42.654
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

1254
02:09:45.465 --> 02:09:48.195
He will come to death...

1255
02:09:48.367 --> 02:09:50.961
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

1256
02:09:51.137 --> 02:09:55.800
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

1257
02:10:04.917 --> 02:10:08.853
But you, my daughter...

1258
02:10:09.687 --> 02:10:14.715
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

1259
02:10:14.893 --> 02:10:18.954
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

1260
02:10:21.367 --> 02:10:23.766
Here you will dwell...

1261
02:10:23.936 --> 02:10:28.838
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

1262
02:10:30.576 --> 02:10:32.566
until all the world is changed...

1263
02:10:32.744 --> 02:10:37.239
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

1264
02:10:45.757 --> 02:10:46.917
Arwen.

1265
02:10:53.564 --> 02:10:55.827
There is nothing for you here...

1266
02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:58.593
only death.

1267
02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:22.000
[Sindarin] <i>Ah im, ú-’erin veleth lîn?</i>
[English] And I, I-have-not love your?

1268
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.400
[Sindarin] <i>Gerich veleth nîn, ada.</i>
[English] You-have my love, father.

1269
02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:20.197
[Sindarin] <i>I amar prestar aen.</i>
[English] The world is changed.

1270
02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:22.850
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne nen.</i>
[English] I feel it in the water.

1271
02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:25.300
[Sindarin] <i>Han mathon ne chae.</i>
[English] I feel it in the earth.

1272
02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:31.100
[Sindarin] <i>A han noston ned ’wilith.</i>
[English] I smell it in the air.

1273
02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:35.689
The power of the enemy is growing.

1274
02:12:35.865 --> 02:12:38.492
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

1275
02:12:38.666 --> 02:12:42.034
to destroy the people of Rohan.

1276
02:12:44.105 --> 02:12:47.734
Isengard has been unleashed.

1277
02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:55.447
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

1278
02:12:56.584 --> 02:12:59.552
the last free kingdom of Men.

1279
02:12:59.754 --> 02:13:04.157
His war on this country will come swiftly.

1280
02:13:07.861 --> 02:13:10.955
He senses the Ring is close.

1281
02:13:11.132 --> 02:13:14.590
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

1282
02:13:14.769 --> 02:13:18.830
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

1283
02:13:20.375 --> 02:13:24.242
the quest will claim his life.

1284
02:13:24.411 --> 02:13:26.573
You know this.

1285
02:13:27.214 --> 02:13:30.047
You have foreseen it.

1286
02:13:32.153 --> 02:13:35.588
It is the risk we all took.

1287
02:13:39.927 --> 02:13:44.125
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

1288
02:13:45.299 --> 02:13:49.736
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

1289
02:13:49.903 --> 02:13:55.363
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

1290
02:13:55.575 --> 02:13:59.137
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1291
02:13:59.345 --> 02:14:03.406
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

1292
02:14:05.853 --> 02:14:07.683
It is close now.

1293
02:14:07.854 --> 02:14:12.120
So close to achieving its goal.

1294
02:14:15.228 --> 02:14:18.858
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1295
02:14:19.032 --> 02:14:23.161
even unto to the ending of the world.

1296
02:14:25.003 --> 02:14:26.835
The time of the Elves...

1297
02:14:27.038 --> 02:14:28.973
is over.

1298
02:14:29.809 --> 02:14:33.404
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

1299
02:14:35.381 --> 02:14:38.645
Do we let them stand alone?

1300
02:14:43.188 --> 02:14:44.553
What news?

1301
02:14:44.724 --> 02:14:47.522
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

1302
02:14:47.693 --> 02:14:50.560
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

1303
02:14:50.730 --> 02:14:54.757
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1304
02:14:54.933 --> 02:14:57.333
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1305
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:59.796
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

1306
02:14:59.972 --> 02:15:03.373
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1307
02:15:04.477 --> 02:15:08.037
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1308
02:15:08.246 --> 02:15:11.272
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

1309
02:15:13.418 --> 02:15:15.613
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1310
02:15:15.787 --> 02:15:18.483
Sauron from Mordor.

1311
02:15:19.791 --> 02:15:23.022
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

1312
02:15:23.193 --> 02:15:24.888
Gondor is weak.

1313
02:15:25.063 --> 02:15:28.190
Sauron will strike us soon.

1314
02:15:28.934 --> 02:15:30.798
And he will strike hard.

1315
02:15:31.236 --> 02:15:35.332
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

1316
02:15:49.219 --> 02:15:51.449
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1317
02:15:51.622 --> 02:15:54.352
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1318
02:15:54.525 --> 02:15:56.789
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

1319
02:16:03.667 --> 02:16:05.396
Speak.

1320
02:16:06.502 --> 02:16:09.096
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1321
02:16:09.439 --> 02:16:12.466
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1322
02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:14.400
Your bodyguard?

1323
02:16:14.612 --> 02:16:16.375
His gardener.

1324
02:16:17.014 --> 02:16:18.982
And where is your skulking friend?

1325
02:16:20.517 --> 02:16:22.815
That gangrel creature.

1326
02:16:23.153 --> 02:16:25.120
He had an ill-favored look.

1327
02:16:26.856 --> 02:16:28.756
There was no other.

1328
02:16:32.862 --> 02:16:35.195
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

1329
02:16:38.534 --> 02:16:41.594
One we lost in Moria...

1330
02:16:42.672 --> 02:16:44.196
two were my kin...

1331
02:16:44.374 --> 02:16:48.105
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

1332
02:16:48.311 --> 02:16:52.213
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

1333
02:16:57.220 --> 02:16:58.983
You're a friend of Boromir?

1334
02:17:01.424 --> 02:17:02.914
Yes.

1335
02:17:03.993 --> 02:17:05.085
For my part.

1336
02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:14.535
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

1337
02:17:16.571 --> 02:17:18.039
Dead?

1338
02:17:18.241 --> 02:17:20.265
How? When?

1339
02:17:20.542 --> 02:17:23.169
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

1340
02:17:23.511 --> 02:17:27.346
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

1341
02:17:30.086 --> 02:17:36.547
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

1342
02:17:36.758 --> 02:17:39.852
It was cloven in two.

1343
02:17:41.462 --> 02:17:44.863
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1344
02:17:46.902 --> 02:17:48.699
He was my brother.

1345
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:40.620
Boromir!

1346
02:18:41.154 --> 02:18:43.020
Boromir!

1347
02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:51.026
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

1348
02:18:51.197 --> 02:18:54.860
A place of light and beauty and music.

1349
02:18:55.034 --> 02:18:57.366
And so it shall be once more!

1350
02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:02.568
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1351
02:19:02.777 --> 02:19:07.144
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

1352
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:16.616
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1353
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:18.957
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1354
02:19:19.124 --> 02:19:21.957
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1355
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:33.434
Good speech. Nice and short.

1356
02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:36.540
Leaves more time for drinking!

1357
02:19:36.842 --> 02:19:41.040
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1358
02:19:44.484 --> 02:19:46.645
Remember today, little brother.

1359
02:19:46.819 --> 02:19:49.811
Today, life is good.

1360
02:19:53.992 --> 02:19:55.584
What?

1361
02:19:55.961 --> 02:19:57.428
He's here.

1362
02:20:00.632 --> 02:20:02.464
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

1363
02:20:02.634 --> 02:20:03.657
Where is he?

1364
02:20:03.835 --> 02:20:07.293
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

1365
02:20:07.872 --> 02:20:09.567
Father!

1366
02:20:14.446 --> 02:20:16.812
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

1367
02:20:16.982 --> 02:20:20.382
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1368
02:20:21.853 --> 02:20:24.754
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

1369
02:20:25.556 --> 02:20:27.854
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1370
02:20:28.026 --> 02:20:30.051
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

1371
02:20:30.228 --> 02:20:31.923
Oh, too few.

1372
02:20:32.431 --> 02:20:34.830
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

1373
02:20:37.033 --> 02:20:40.026
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1374
02:20:40.238 --> 02:20:42.467
That is not my intent.

1375
02:20:42.673 --> 02:20:46.439
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

1376
02:20:49.813 --> 02:20:52.714
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1377
02:20:52.884 --> 02:20:55.647
I know his uses, and they are few.

1378
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:59.414
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1379
02:21:00.591 --> 02:21:03.024
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1380
02:21:03.193 --> 02:21:06.060
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

1381
02:21:06.229 --> 02:21:10.029
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1382
02:21:12.269 --> 02:21:14.533
The One Ring.

1383
02:21:17.308 --> 02:21:21.971
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1384
02:21:22.144 --> 02:21:25.774
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1385
02:21:25.949 --> 02:21:30.079
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1386
02:21:31.889 --> 02:21:34.549
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1387
02:21:34.724 --> 02:21:38.420
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

1388
02:21:38.594 --> 02:21:42.497
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

1389
02:21:42.666 --> 02:21:47.967
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

1390
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:53.198
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

1391
02:21:53.409 --> 02:21:54.876
He will return.

1392
02:21:55.077 --> 02:21:58.809
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

1393
02:21:58.981 --> 02:22:01.542
You must go.

1394
02:22:02.717 --> 02:22:04.811
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1395
02:22:05.653 --> 02:22:11.149
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

1396
02:22:11.327 --> 02:22:15.024
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1397
02:22:15.197 --> 02:22:18.165
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1398
02:22:19.368 --> 02:22:21.302
Oh, I see.

1399
02:22:21.469 --> 02:22:25.667
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

1400
02:22:26.107 --> 02:22:28.076
I think not.

1401
02:22:28.276 --> 02:22:31.144
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1402
02:22:31.313 --> 02:22:34.213
The one who will not fail me.

1403
02:22:51.299 --> 02:22:54.462
Remember today, little brother.

1404
02:23:12.854 --> 02:23:14.844
Captain Faramir!

1405
02:23:16.124 --> 02:23:18.250
We found the third one.

1406
02:23:29.770 --> 02:23:31.738
You must come with me. Now.

1407
02:23:42.949 --> 02:23:44.041
Down there.

1408
02:23:58.965 --> 02:24:01.865
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

1409
02:24:12.478 --> 02:24:13.968
They wait for my command.

1410
02:24:19.452 --> 02:24:20.544
Shall I shoot?

1411
02:24:21.787 --> 02:24:24.813
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

1412
02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:26.821
So juicy sweet

1413
02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:30.429
Our only wish To catch a fish

1414
02:24:30.597 --> 02:24:33.291
So juicy sweet

1415
02:24:40.272 --> 02:24:41.670
Wait.

1416
02:24:43.175 --> 02:24:46.007
This creature is bound to me.

1417
02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:48.545
And I to him.

1418
02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:53.114
He is our guide.

1419
02:24:57.857 --> 02:24:59.256
Please...

1420
02:24:59.425 --> 02:25:01.289
let me go down to him.

1421
02:25:12.604 --> 02:25:14.265
Smeagol.

1422
02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:17.502
Master is here.

1423
02:25:18.709 --> 02:25:19.835
Come, Smeagol.

1424
02:25:22.714 --> 02:25:25.342
Trust master. Come.

1425
02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:32.353
We must go now?

1426
02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:36.160
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1427
02:25:36.326 --> 02:25:37.725
Follow me. Come on.

1428
02:25:38.962 --> 02:25:40.452
Come.

1429
02:25:43.001 --> 02:25:44.160
Come, Smeagol.

1430
02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:46.726
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1431
02:25:47.271 --> 02:25:48.761
Come on.

1432
02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:54.871
Don't hurt him!

1433
02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:57.775
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

1434
02:25:57.948 --> 02:25:59.246
Master!

1435
02:26:43.667 --> 02:26:48.434
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1436
02:26:49.706 --> 02:26:52.300
Cruel Men hurts us.

1437
02:26:52.509 --> 02:26:55.478
Master tricksed us.

1438
02:26:55.679 --> 02:26:59.240
Of course he did.

1439
02:26:59.616 --> 02:27:03.313
I told you he was tricksy.

1440
02:27:03.486 --> 02:27:06.512
I told you he was false.

1441
02:27:06.690 --> 02:27:09.386
Master is our friend.

1442
02:27:09.559 --> 02:27:11.925
Our friend.

1443
02:27:12.095 --> 02:27:14.256
Master betrayed us.

1444
02:27:14.431 --> 02:27:17.423
No. Not its business.

1445
02:27:18.501 --> 02:27:20.969
Leave us alone!

1446
02:27:21.137 --> 02:27:23.537
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1447
02:27:23.707 --> 02:27:26.005
They stole it from us!

1448
02:27:26.176 --> 02:27:27.609
No. No.

1449
02:27:28.178 --> 02:27:29.805
What did they steal?

1450
02:27:31.948 --> 02:27:37.284
My precious!

1451
02:27:40.924 --> 02:27:42.551
We have to get out of here.

1452
02:27:43.159 --> 02:27:45.127
You go. Go, now.

1453
02:27:47.731 --> 02:27:49.596
You can do it.

1454
02:27:51.034 --> 02:27:52.501
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1455
02:27:52.702 --> 02:27:54.465
Just this once.

1456
02:27:54.671 --> 02:27:56.400
Put it on.

1457
02:27:56.873 --> 02:27:58.864
Disappear.

1458
02:27:59.943 --> 02:28:01.001
I can't.

1459
02:28:04.114 --> 02:28:06.344
You were right, Sam.

1460
02:28:07.784 --> 02:28:10.275
You tried to tell me but...

1461
02:28:14.991 --> 02:28:17.152
I'm sorry.

1462
02:28:21.698 --> 02:28:24.565
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1463
02:28:26.002 --> 02:28:27.629
If I put it on...

1464
02:28:27.837 --> 02:28:30.169
he'll find me.

1465
02:28:31.841 --> 02:28:33.809
He'll see.

1466
02:28:35.044 --> 02:28:37.012
Mr. Frodo...

1467
02:28:41.885 --> 02:28:46.151
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1468
02:28:48.358 --> 02:28:51.350
Here in the Wild I have you...

1469
02:28:51.528 --> 02:28:53.428
two Halflings...

1470
02:28:53.596 --> 02:28:56.759
and a host of men at my call.

1471
02:29:00.103 --> 02:29:03.561
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1472
02:29:13.283 --> 02:29:17.014
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1473
02:29:18.621 --> 02:29:21.647
to show his quality.

1474
02:29:42.745 --> 02:29:44.337
No!

1475
02:29:47.517 --> 02:29:48.848
Stop it!

1476
02:29:49.018 --> 02:29:50.076
Leave him alone.

1477
02:29:51.421 --> 02:29:53.912
Don't you understand?

1478
02:29:55.225 --> 02:29:57.125
He's got to destroy it!

1479
02:29:57.293 --> 02:30:00.524
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1480
02:30:00.697 --> 02:30:02.358
To the Mountain of Fire!

1481
02:30:03.433 --> 02:30:06.527
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1482
02:30:06.736 --> 02:30:09.705
Please. It's such a burden.

1483
02:30:11.908 --> 02:30:13.967
Will you not help him?

1484
02:30:15.345 --> 02:30:17.245
Captain?

1485
02:30:17.914 --> 02:30:20.144
Prepare to leave.

1486
02:30:25.088 --> 02:30:27.522
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1487
02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:32.900
[Sindarin] <i>Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.</i>
[English] Well done, Brego, my friend.

1488
02:31:40.463 --> 02:31:43.091
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1489
02:31:43.266 --> 02:31:46.326
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

1490
02:31:46.536 --> 02:31:50.267
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1491
02:31:50.473 --> 02:31:54.466
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1492
02:31:55.178 --> 02:31:56.645
Bless you, laddie.

1493
02:31:57.246 --> 02:31:58.975
Gimli, where is the king?

1494
02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:09.350
[Sindarin] <i>Le abdollen.</i>
[English] You’re late.

1495
02:32:12.762 --> 02:32:14.093
You look terrible.

1496
02:32:41.500 --> 02:32:44.100
[Sindarin] <i>Hannon le.</i>
[English] Thank you.

1497
02:32:55.838 --> 02:32:57.863
A great host, you say?

1498
02:32:58.074 --> 02:33:00.736
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1499
02:33:01.411 --> 02:33:04.403
Ten thousand strong at least.

1500
02:33:05.948 --> 02:33:07.381
Ten thousand?

1501
02:33:07.817 --> 02:33:10.308
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1502
02:33:12.989 --> 02:33:15.116
To destroy the world of Men.

1503
02:33:17.627 --> 02:33:19.618
They will be here by nightfall.

1504
02:33:25.468 --> 02:33:26.765
Let them come!

1505
02:33:28.304 --> 02:33:31.034
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

1506
02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:34.368
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1507
02:33:42.552 --> 02:33:45.487
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

1508
02:33:45.655 --> 02:33:48.089
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

1509
02:33:48.257 --> 02:33:50.987
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1510
02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:53.560
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1511
02:33:54.163 --> 02:33:56.358
These are Uruk-hai.

1512
02:33:56.532 --> 02:33:59.968
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

1513
02:34:01.637 --> 02:34:05.266
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1514
02:34:05.475 --> 02:34:09.070
I know how to defend my own keep.

1515
02:34:15.685 --> 02:34:19.086
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

1516
02:34:19.255 --> 02:34:24.488
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

1517
02:34:24.694 --> 02:34:27.356
Crops can be resown...

1518
02:34:27.530 --> 02:34:30.522
homes rebuilt.

1519
02:34:31.134 --> 02:34:33.694
Within these walls...

1520
02:34:34.103 --> 02:34:35.570
we will outlast them.

1521
02:34:35.772 --> 02:34:38.172
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

1522
02:34:38.341 --> 02:34:39.865
They come to destroy its people...

1523
02:34:40.009 --> 02:34:42.477
down to the last child.

1524
02:34:43.379 --> 02:34:45.643
What would you have me do?

1525
02:34:45.815 --> 02:34:47.544
Look at my men.

1526
02:34:47.717 --> 02:34:49.446
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1527
02:34:51.654 --> 02:34:56.057
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

1528
02:34:56.225 --> 02:34:59.251
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1529
02:35:02.899 --> 02:35:04.799
Send out riders, my lord.

1530
02:35:05.101 --> 02:35:07.968
You must call for aid.

1531
02:35:11.274 --> 02:35:13.538
And who will come?

1532
02:35:13.943 --> 02:35:15.535
Elves?

1533
02:35:15.711 --> 02:35:17.770
Dwarves?

1534
02:35:18.548 --> 02:35:21.415
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1535
02:35:22.251 --> 02:35:24.515
The old alliances are dead.

1536
02:35:24.954 --> 02:35:27.752
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1537
02:35:27.924 --> 02:35:30.119
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1538
02:35:31.093 --> 02:35:34.324
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

1539
02:35:34.497 --> 02:35:36.431
Where was Gon...?

1540
02:35:39.101 --> 02:35:41.001
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1541
02:35:42.605 --> 02:35:45.073
we are alone.

1542
02:35:51.948 --> 02:35:53.677
Get the women and children into the caves.

1543
02:35:53.850 --> 02:35:55.112
We need more time to lay provisions...

1544
02:35:55.284 --> 02:35:58.776
There is no time. War is upon us.

1545
02:35:59.055 --> 02:36:00.750
Secure the gate.

1546
02:36:05.962 --> 02:36:08.055
We Ents have not troubled...

1547
02:36:08.264 --> 02:36:11.631
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1548
02:36:12.401 --> 02:36:15.393
for a very long time.

1549
02:36:16.672 --> 02:36:21.439
But now, something is about to happen...

1550
02:36:21.611 --> 02:36:23.943
that has not happened...

1551
02:36:24.146 --> 02:36:26.614
for an age.

1552
02:36:27.817 --> 02:36:30.081
Entmoot.

1553
02:36:30.519 --> 02:36:31.508
What's that?

1554
02:36:31.921 --> 02:36:34.754
'Tis a gathering.

1555
02:36:35.958 --> 02:36:38.518
A gathering of what?

1556
02:36:56.479 --> 02:36:58.845
Beech. Oak.

1557
02:36:59.015 --> 02:37:00.915
Chestnut. Ash.

1558
02:37:01.183 --> 02:37:03.151
Good. Good. Good.

1559
02:37:03.319 --> 02:37:05.685
Many have come.

1560
02:37:13.229 --> 02:37:15.993
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1561
02:37:16.165 --> 02:37:18.725
will go to war.

1562
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:30.770
Move back! Move to the caves!

1563
02:37:33.249 --> 02:37:35.308
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1564
02:37:35.718 --> 02:37:38.016
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1565
02:37:38.187 --> 02:37:40.417
They can support the archers from above the gate.

1566
02:37:40.589 --> 02:37:43.717
Aragorn, you must rest.

1567
02:37:43.893 --> 02:37:46.293
You're no use to us half alive.

1568
02:37:46.762 --> 02:37:47.956
Aragorn!

1569
02:37:51.367 --> 02:37:54.393
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

1570
02:37:54.603 --> 02:37:56.230
That is an honorable charge.

1571
02:37:56.439 --> 02:37:59.306
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1572
02:37:59.475 --> 02:38:01.170
What renown is there in that?

1573
02:38:01.344 --> 02:38:05.041
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

1574
02:38:05.314 --> 02:38:08.112
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

1575
02:38:08.284 --> 02:38:13.278
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1576
02:38:13.589 --> 02:38:16.387
You do not command the others to stay!

1577
02:38:16.559 --> 02:38:20.325
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

1578
02:38:21.497 --> 02:38:23.692
Because they love you.

1579
02:38:30.840 --> 02:38:32.330
I'm sorry.

1580
02:39:38.274 --> 02:39:41.505
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1581
02:39:42.578 --> 02:39:44.375
These are no soldiers.

1582
02:39:46.649 --> 02:39:50.107
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1583
02:39:54.056 --> 02:39:56.957
Look at them. They're frightened.

1584
02:39:57.126 --> 02:39:58.593
I can see it in their eyes.

1585
02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:05.600
[Sindarin] <i>Boe a hyn...</i>
[English] And they should be...

1586
02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:08.600
[Sindarin] <i>Neled herain... dan caer menig.</i>
[English] Three hundred... against ten thousand.

1587
02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:13.100
[Sindarin] <i>Si, beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.</i>
[English] Here they-will-defend them-selves sharper than at Edoras.

1588
02:40:13.100 --> 02:40:16.600
[Sindarin] <i>Aragorn, nedin dagor hen ú-’erir ortheri.</i>
[English] Aragorn, in this battle they can not win.

1589
02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:19.350
[Sindarin] <i>Natha daged dhaer</i>
[English] It will be great slaying.

1590
02:40:19.582 --> 02:40:21.777
Then I shall die as one of them!

1591
02:40:28.224 --> 02:40:30.055
Let him go, lad.

1592
02:40:30.626 --> 02:40:32.594
Let him be.

1593
02:40:34.063 --> 02:40:39.524
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

1594
02:40:43.772 --> 02:40:45.672
My lord?

1595
02:40:47.743 --> 02:40:50.303
Who am I, Gamling?

1596
02:40:53.682 --> 02:40:57.584
You are our king, sire.

1597
02:41:00.589 --> 02:41:03.854
And do you trust your king?

1598
02:41:05.394 --> 02:41:08.557
Your men, my lord...

1599
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:11.529
will follow you to whatever end.

1600
02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:20.340
To whatever end.

1601
02:41:30.186 --> 02:41:33.747
Where is the horse and the rider?

1602
02:41:33.923 --> 02:41:36.983
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1603
02:41:38.494 --> 02:41:42.863
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

1604
02:41:43.866 --> 02:41:47.097
Like wind in the meadow.

1605
02:41:50.806 --> 02:41:54.572
The days have gone down in the West...

1606
02:41:55.277 --> 02:41:57.905
behind the hills...

1607
02:41:59.815 --> 02:42:01.442
into Shadow.

1608
02:42:09.892 --> 02:42:13.328
How did it come to this?

1609
02:42:34.650 --> 02:42:36.515
It's been going for hours.

1610
02:42:37.653 --> 02:42:40.019
They must have decided something by now.

1611
02:42:40.189 --> 02:42:44.285
Decided? No.

1612
02:42:44.460 --> 02:42:49.591
We only just finished saying...

1613
02:42:50.799 --> 02:42:52.664
good morning.

1614
02:42:54.036 --> 02:42:57.199
But it's nighttime already.

1615
02:42:57.406 --> 02:42:59.203
You can't take forever.

1616
02:43:00.209 --> 02:43:02.234
Don't be hasty.

1617
02:43:02.711 --> 02:43:05.111
We're running out of time!

1618
02:43:08.117 --> 02:43:11.086
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1619
02:43:28.671 --> 02:43:29.968
Give me your sword.

1620
02:43:39.481 --> 02:43:40.607
What is your name?

1621
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:43.516
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1622
02:43:45.654 --> 02:43:48.282
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

1623
02:43:50.259 --> 02:43:52.227
They say that it is hopeless.

1624
02:44:10.079 --> 02:44:11.706
This is a good sword.

1625
02:44:13.749 --> 02:44:16.081
Haleth, son of Hama...

1626
02:44:20.422 --> 02:44:22.583
there is always hope.

1627
02:44:45.514 --> 02:44:48.881
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1628
02:44:49.051 --> 02:44:50.609
Forgive me.

1629
02:44:50.786 --> 02:44:52.219
I was wrong to despair.

1630
02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:57.300
[Sindarin] <i>Ú-moe edaved, Legolas</i>
[English] There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1631
02:45:01.430 --> 02:45:04.228
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1632
02:45:07.703 --> 02:45:09.728
It's a little tight across the chest.

1633
02:45:15.944 --> 02:45:17.912
That is no Orc horn.

1634
02:45:23.585 --> 02:45:25.416
Send for the king.

1635
02:45:25.587 --> 02:45:29.182
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1636
02:46:00.823 --> 02:46:02.484
How is this possible?

1637
02:46:03.492 --> 02:46:07.121
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1638
02:46:07.296 --> 02:46:10.527
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

1639
02:46:11.233 --> 02:46:15.465
Long ago we fought and died together.

1640
02:46:17.773 --> 02:46:20.674
We come to honor that allegiance.

1641
02:46:21.100 --> 02:46:23.600
[Sindarin] <i>Mae govannen, Haldir.</i>
[English] Well-met, Haldir.

1642
02:46:29.151 --> 02:46:31.085
You are most welcome.

1643
02:46:36.458 --> 02:46:40.394
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

1644
02:47:14.062 --> 02:47:17.327
You could have picked a better spot.

1645
02:47:22.237 --> 02:47:26.401
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

1646
02:47:32.581 --> 02:47:34.378
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1647
02:47:35.017 --> 02:47:37.508
Let's hope they last the night.

1648
02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:40.600
[Sindarin] <i>A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn...</i>
[English] O Children-of-Eru, don’t show mercy to them...

1649
02:48:41.900 --> 02:48:44.900
[Sindarin] <i>...an uben tanatha le faelas!</i>
[English] ...for nobody will show you mercy!

1650
02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:21.718
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1651
02:49:22.991 --> 02:49:24.788
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1652
02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:06.100
[Sindarin] <i>Dartho!</i>
[English] Hold!

1653
02:50:27.989 --> 02:50:29.786
So it begins.

1654
02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:37.600
[Sindarin] <i>Tangado a chadad!</i>
[English] Prepare to fire!

1655
02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:47.100
[Sindarin] <i>Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc...</i>
[English] Their armour is poor below the neck...

1656
02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:49.600
[Sindarin] <i>...a nu ranc!</i>
[English] ...and under arm!

1657
02:50:49.850 --> 02:50:51.850
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

1658
02:50:56.618 --> 02:50:57.983
Did they hit anything?

1659
02:50:58.653 --> 02:51:00.644
Give them a volley.

1660
02:51:00.822 --> 02:51:02.915
- Fire!
- Fire!

1661
02:51:18.673 --> 02:51:20.368
Send them to me! Come on!

1662
02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:41.200
[Sindarin] <i>Pendraith!</i>
[English] Ladders!

1663
02:51:41.062 --> 02:51:42.154
Good!

1664
02:51:48.970 --> 02:51:51.939
Swords! Swords!

1665
02:52:30.078 --> 02:52:32.205
Legolas! Two already!

1666
02:52:32.380 --> 02:52:34.507
I'm on 17!

1667
02:52:34.683 --> 02:52:37.243
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1668
02:52:43.992 --> 02:52:45.721
Nineteen!

1669
02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:13.153
Merry.

1670
02:53:17.559 --> 02:53:21.359
We have just agreed.

1671
02:53:31.406 --> 02:53:32.873
Yes?

1672
02:53:34.376 --> 02:53:38.540
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1673
02:53:39.681 --> 02:53:42.844
and we have agreed...

1674
02:53:43.318 --> 02:53:47.345
you are not Orcs.

1675
02:53:49.090 --> 02:53:51.217
Well, that's good news.

1676
02:53:51.393 --> 02:53:55.523
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

1677
02:53:56.164 --> 02:53:59.964
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1678
02:54:00.135 --> 02:54:01.659
Hasty?

1679
02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:04.370
Our friends are out there.

1680
02:54:04.539 --> 02:54:08.703
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1681
02:54:09.044 --> 02:54:11.308
War? Yes.

1682
02:54:11.479 --> 02:54:13.379
It affects us all.

1683
02:54:13.548 --> 02:54:16.540
Tree, root and twig.

1684
02:54:17.419 --> 02:54:21.446
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1685
02:54:21.656 --> 02:54:23.590
it takes a long time...

1686
02:54:23.758 --> 02:54:28.661
to say anything in Old Entish...

1687
02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:33.062
and we never say anything...

1688
02:54:33.234 --> 02:54:37.170
unless it is worth taking...

1689
02:54:37.339 --> 02:54:41.298
a long time to say.

1690
02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:45.409
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1691
02:54:45.580 --> 02:54:46.638
Nineteen!

1692
02:54:47.215 --> 02:54:49.080
Twenty!

1693
02:54:49.250 --> 02:54:50.911
Twenty-one!

1694
02:55:00.996 --> 02:55:02.087
Causeway!

1695
02:55:02.146 --> 02:55:03.437
[Sindarin] <i>Na fennas!</i>
[English] To gateway!

1696
02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:06.000
[Sindarin] <i>Hado ribed! Hado!</i>
[English] Hurl to flow! Hurl!

1697
02:55:10.805 --> 02:55:13.171
Is this it?

1698
02:55:13.341 --> 02:55:16.276
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1699
02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:44.600
[Sindarin] <i>Togo hon dad, Legolas!</i>
[English] Bring him down, Legolas!

1700
02:55:47.100 --> 02:55:48.100
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

1701
02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:50.100
[Sindarin] <i>Dago hon!</i>
[English] Kill him!

1702
02:56:42.263 --> 02:56:43.628
Brace the gate!

1703
02:57:01.983 --> 02:57:04.247
Hold them! Stand firm!

1704
02:57:12.127 --> 02:57:13.458
Aragorn!

1705
02:57:18.099 --> 02:57:19.293
Gimli!

1706
02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:27.300
[Sindarin] <i>Hado i philinn!</i>
[English] Release the arrows!

1707
02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:32.100
[Sindarin] <i>Herio!</i>
[English] Charge!

1708
02:58:08.049 --> 02:58:11.985
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1709
02:58:12.754 --> 02:58:16.781
We must weather such things as we have always done.

1710
02:58:17.592 --> 02:58:19.685
How can that be your decision?!

1711
02:58:20.361 --> 02:58:23.990
This is not our war.

1712
02:58:24.299 --> 02:58:26.494
But you're part of this world!

1713
02:58:30.672 --> 02:58:32.503
Aren't you?!

1714
02:58:36.578 --> 02:58:38.944
You must help. Please.

1715
02:58:40.181 --> 02:58:42.945
You must do something.

1716
02:58:43.218 --> 02:58:47.518
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1717
02:58:48.723 --> 02:58:52.454
But your part in this tale is over.

1718
02:58:52.627 --> 02:58:54.857
Go back to your home.

1719
02:59:04.906 --> 02:59:07.170
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1720
02:59:07.342 --> 02:59:09.207
We don't belong here, Merry.

1721
02:59:09.377 --> 02:59:11.641
It's too big for us.

1722
02:59:11.813 --> 02:59:14.475
What can we do in the end?

1723
02:59:16.784 --> 02:59:19.412
We've got the Shire.

1724
02:59:19.954 --> 02:59:22.479
Maybe we should go home.

1725
02:59:24.325 --> 02:59:27.556
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1726
02:59:27.729 --> 02:59:32.632
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

1727
02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:34.392
And...

1728
02:59:36.237 --> 02:59:39.263
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

1729
02:59:42.777 --> 02:59:45.712
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1730
03:00:05.233 --> 03:00:06.461
Aragorn!

1731
03:00:06.634 --> 03:00:09.000
Fall back to the Keep!

1732
03:00:09.203 --> 03:00:12.263
Get your men out of there!

1733
03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:15.600
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

1734
03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:21.600
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

1735
03:00:22.199 --> 03:00:23.560
Haldir!

1736
03:00:24.600 --> 03:00:27.600
[Sindarin] <i>Nan barad!</i>
[English] To tower!

1737
03:00:27.722 --> 03:00:30.987
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

1738
03:00:50.428 --> 03:00:51.656
Haldir!

1739
03:01:34.122 --> 03:01:35.612
Brace the gate!

1740
03:01:37.859 --> 03:01:39.156
Hold them!

1741
03:01:40.928 --> 03:01:44.295
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1742
03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:14.394
Make way!

1743
03:02:17.298 --> 03:02:19.027
We cannot hold much longer!

1744
03:02:25.039 --> 03:02:28.566
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1745
03:02:28.776 --> 03:02:31.336
As long as you can give me.

1746
03:02:31.512 --> 03:02:33.173
Gimli!

1747
03:02:34.649 --> 03:02:36.014
Timbers!

1748
03:02:36.184 --> 03:02:38.152
Brace the gate!

1749
03:02:52.867 --> 03:02:54.562
Come on. We can take them.

1750
03:02:55.436 --> 03:02:57.028
It's a long way.

1751
03:03:02.310 --> 03:03:04.073
Toss me.

1752
03:03:05.246 --> 03:03:07.077
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1753
03:03:07.248 --> 03:03:08.806
You'll have to toss me!

1754
03:03:14.422 --> 03:03:15.684
Don't tell the Elf.

1755
03:03:16.224 --> 03:03:17.987
Not a word.

1756
03:03:33.274 --> 03:03:34.707
Shore up the door!

1757
03:03:34.876 --> 03:03:36.969
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1758
03:03:37.144 --> 03:03:38.202
Watch our backs!

1759
03:03:42.283 --> 03:03:44.513
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1760
03:04:34.502 --> 03:04:35.901
Hold fast the gate!

1761
03:04:40.107 --> 03:04:43.042
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1762
03:04:47.782 --> 03:04:49.374
Aragorn!

1763
03:05:22.850 --> 03:05:25.284
Pull everybody back.

1764
03:05:25.653 --> 03:05:27.450
Pull them back.

1765
03:05:27.989 --> 03:05:29.456
Fall back!

1766
03:05:29.624 --> 03:05:32.115
Fall back!

1767
03:05:33.294 --> 03:05:34.989
They have broken through!

1768
03:05:35.162 --> 03:05:37.426
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1769
03:05:37.598 --> 03:05:39.828
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1770
03:05:39.934 --> 03:05:42.528
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1771
03:05:42.737 --> 03:05:44.967
Into the Keep!

1772
03:05:56.450 --> 03:06:01.410
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

1773
03:06:01.589 --> 03:06:06.288
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1774
03:06:12.033 --> 03:06:13.295
Wait! Stop!

1775
03:06:14.201 --> 03:06:15.691
Stop!

1776
03:06:18.839 --> 03:06:20.534
Turn around.

1777
03:06:21.475 --> 03:06:24.171
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1778
03:06:24.345 --> 03:06:29.339
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1779
03:06:29.684 --> 03:06:32.380
Yes. Exactly.

1780
03:06:32.553 --> 03:06:35.784
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

1781
03:06:35.956 --> 03:06:38.618
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1782
03:06:38.793 --> 03:06:40.784
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1783
03:06:43.397 --> 03:06:46.423
That doesn't make sense to me.

1784
03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:47.760
But then...

1785
03:06:47.968 --> 03:06:50.630
you are very small.

1786
03:06:51.138 --> 03:06:52.867
Perhaps you're right.

1787
03:06:55.543 --> 03:06:57.033
South it is, then.

1788
03:06:58.579 --> 03:07:01.912
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1789
03:07:03.951 --> 03:07:06.715
I always like going south.

1790
03:07:06.887 --> 03:07:11.187
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1791
03:07:11.792 --> 03:07:14.260
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1792
03:07:14.428 --> 03:07:16.362
No, we won't.

1793
03:07:17.098 --> 03:07:19.362
Not this time.

1794
03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:27.029
Look!

1795
03:07:28.709 --> 03:07:31.143
Osgiliath burns!

1796
03:07:31.312 --> 03:07:32.745
Mordor has come.

1797
03:07:33.881 --> 03:07:36.281
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1798
03:07:37.618 --> 03:07:39.813
It has only the power to destroy.

1799
03:07:40.654 --> 03:07:42.087
Please...

1800
03:07:42.256 --> 03:07:43.883
let me go.

1801
03:07:44.925 --> 03:07:46.517
Hurry.

1802
03:07:49.997 --> 03:07:51.396
Faramir!

1803
03:07:51.565 --> 03:07:54.056
You must let me go!

1804
03:07:54.502 --> 03:07:57.960
And those little family of field mice...

1805
03:07:58.139 --> 03:08:00.972
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

1806
03:08:01.709 --> 03:08:05.008
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

1807
03:08:16.190 --> 03:08:19.125
Many of these trees were my friends.

1808
03:08:19.827 --> 03:08:24.457
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1809
03:08:25.633 --> 03:08:26.827
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1810
03:08:27.001 --> 03:08:29.765
They had voices of their own.

1811
03:08:32.039 --> 03:08:34.564
Saruman.

1812
03:08:34.942 --> 03:08:38.002
A wizard should know better!

1813
03:08:52.226 --> 03:08:55.855
There is no curse in Elvish...

1814
03:08:56.063 --> 03:08:58.725
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1815
03:08:58.899 --> 03:09:01.231
for this treachery.

1816
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:05.503
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1817
03:09:10.211 --> 03:09:11.405
Where are they going?

1818
03:09:11.946 --> 03:09:15.177
They have business with the Orcs.

1819
03:09:15.649 --> 03:09:19.915
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1820
03:09:20.087 --> 03:09:22.715
with rock and stone.

1821
03:09:46.614 --> 03:09:47.740
Yes.

1822
03:09:48.849 --> 03:09:50.282
Come, my friends.

1823
03:09:51.619 --> 03:09:55.817
The Ents are going to war.

1824
03:09:55.990 --> 03:09:57.753
It is likely...

1825
03:09:57.925 --> 03:10:01.452
that we go to our doom.

1826
03:10:02.863 --> 03:10:05.331
Last march...

1827
03:10:05.866 --> 03:10:07.891
of the Ents.

1828
03:10:56.016 --> 03:10:59.747
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1829
03:10:59.920 --> 03:11:01.979
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1830
03:11:04.758 --> 03:11:06.225
Mr. Frodo?

1831
03:11:06.527 --> 03:11:10.623
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

1832
03:11:10.798 --> 03:11:13.289
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1833
03:11:27.648 --> 03:11:29.047
Take them to my father.

1834
03:11:30.617 --> 03:11:33.609
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1835
03:11:36.023 --> 03:11:39.049
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

1836
03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:42.856
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

1837
03:11:43.497 --> 03:11:46.261
You want to know why your brother died?

1838
03:11:46.767 --> 03:11:50.498
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1839
03:11:50.704 --> 03:11:52.604
He tried to kill him!

1840
03:11:52.773 --> 03:11:55.105
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1841
03:11:55.876 --> 03:11:57.741
Watch out!

1842
03:12:08.655 --> 03:12:09.781
Mr. Frodo?

1843
03:12:12.426 --> 03:12:14.257
They're here.

1844
03:12:17.364 --> 03:12:19.832
They've come.

1845
03:12:22.436 --> 03:12:24.336
Nazgul!

1846
03:12:46.393 --> 03:12:48.554
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1847
03:12:50.364 --> 03:12:52.594
Take cover!

1848
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:11.508
The fortress is taken.

1849
03:13:12.286 --> 03:13:13.480
It is over.

1850
03:13:13.654 --> 03:13:17.590
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

1851
03:13:17.758 --> 03:13:20.693
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

1852
03:13:23.430 --> 03:13:24.829
They're breaking in!

1853
03:13:27.468 --> 03:13:29.959
They're past the door!

1854
03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:37.470
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1855
03:13:40.080 --> 03:13:42.014
Is there no other way?

1856
03:13:43.584 --> 03:13:46.644
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

1857
03:13:47.321 --> 03:13:49.516
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

1858
03:13:54.394 --> 03:13:56.794
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1859
03:13:56.964 --> 03:13:59.831
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1860
03:14:02.035 --> 03:14:05.436
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1861
03:14:10.110 --> 03:14:11.543
Ride out with me.

1862
03:14:15.649 --> 03:14:17.276
Ride out and meet them.

1863
03:14:18.051 --> 03:14:20.212
For death and glory.

1864
03:14:20.387 --> 03:14:21.786
For Rohan.

1865
03:14:23.290 --> 03:14:24.757
For your people.

1866
03:14:25.492 --> 03:14:27.426
The sun is rising.

1867
03:14:31.932 --> 03:14:34.924
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

1868
03:14:35.102 --> 03:14:36.501
At dawn...

1869
03:14:36.703 --> 03:14:38.364
look to the east.

1870
03:14:42.543 --> 03:14:44.170
Yes.

1871
03:14:46.647 --> 03:14:48.308
Yes.

1872
03:14:49.650 --> 03:14:52.050
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1873
03:14:52.219 --> 03:14:55.017
shall sound in the Deep...

1874
03:14:55.455 --> 03:14:57.446
one last time.

1875
03:14:57.624 --> 03:14:59.114
Yes!

1876
03:15:02.162 --> 03:15:05.962
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

1877
03:15:13.774 --> 03:15:15.105
Fell deeds, awake.

1878
03:15:16.310 --> 03:15:17.368
Now for wrath...

1879
03:15:17.578 --> 03:15:20.979
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1880
03:15:28.271 --> 03:15:30.535
[Rohirric] <i>Forð Eorlingas!</i>
[English] Forth Eorlingas!

1881
03:16:18.071 --> 03:16:19.265
Gandalf.

1882
03:16:26.580 --> 03:16:30.243
Theoden King stands alone.

1883
03:16:30.851 --> 03:16:33.012
Not alone.

1884
03:16:33.420 --> 03:16:34.546
Rohirrim!

1885
03:16:40.460 --> 03:16:41.620
Eomer.

1886
03:16:41.795 --> 03:16:44.320
To the king!

1887
03:18:01.975 --> 03:18:03.738
Yes!

1888
03:18:12.886 --> 03:18:16.322
A hit. A fine hit.

1889
03:18:40.847 --> 03:18:43.315
Break the dam!

1890
03:18:43.483 --> 03:18:46.919
Release the river!

1891
03:19:14.281 --> 03:19:17.011
Pippin! Hold on!

1892
03:19:22.289 --> 03:19:25.224
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1893
03:20:06.533 --> 03:20:08.558
What are you doing?

1894
03:20:17.177 --> 03:20:18.701
Where are you going?

1895
03:21:16.903 --> 03:21:18.200
It's me.

1896
03:21:20.740 --> 03:21:22.935
It's your Sam.

1897
03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:29.908
Don't you know your Sam?

1898
03:21:47.567 --> 03:21:50.934
I can't do this, Sam.

1899
03:21:51.871 --> 03:21:53.839
I know.

1900
03:21:54.874 --> 03:21:57.240
It's all wrong.

1901
03:21:57.978 --> 03:22:00.003
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1902
03:22:07.420 --> 03:22:09.513
But we are.

1903
03:22:15.929 --> 03:22:18.955
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1904
03:22:19.132 --> 03:22:21.532
The ones that really mattered.

1905
03:22:22.569 --> 03:22:25.561
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1906
03:22:25.772 --> 03:22:28.741
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

1907
03:22:28.908 --> 03:22:31.843
because how could the end be happy?

1908
03:22:34.414 --> 03:22:36.609
How could the world go back to the way it was...

1909
03:22:36.783 --> 03:22:40.219
when so much bad had happened?

1910
03:22:41.054 --> 03:22:42.954
Victory!

1911
03:22:43.123 --> 03:22:44.681
We have victory!

1912
03:22:44.858 --> 03:22:48.794
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

1913
03:22:48.962 --> 03:22:50.293
this shadow.

1914
03:22:50.463 --> 03:22:52.863
Even darkness must pass.

1915
03:22:53.033 --> 03:22:55.729
A new day will come.

1916
03:22:55.935 --> 03:22:59.871
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

1917
03:23:01.808 --> 03:23:04.174
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

1918
03:23:04.344 --> 03:23:06.107
that meant something.

1919
03:23:06.279 --> 03:23:08.839
Even if you were too small to understand why.

1920
03:23:10.216 --> 03:23:14.084
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1921
03:23:14.254 --> 03:23:15.812
I know now.

1922
03:23:16.656 --> 03:23:18.851
Folk in those stories...

1923
03:23:19.025 --> 03:23:23.155
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

1924
03:23:23.329 --> 03:23:25.559
They kept going...

1925
03:23:26.232 --> 03:23:29.497
because they were holding on to something.

1926
03:23:31.137 --> 03:23:33.435
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1927
03:23:45.318 --> 03:23:49.254
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1928
03:23:49.522 --> 03:23:52.150
And it's worth fighting for.

1929
03:24:19.085 --> 03:24:23.385
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

1930
03:24:24.124 --> 03:24:28.083
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

1931
03:24:28.261 --> 03:24:30.456
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

1932
03:24:34.834 --> 03:24:36.233
Then it is forfeit.

1933
03:24:39.005 --> 03:24:40.700
Release them.

1934
03:24:52.786 --> 03:24:54.845
Stay out of the forest!

1935
03:24:55.021 --> 03:24:56.818
Keep away from the trees!

1936
03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:49.437
Final count...

1937
03:25:49.609 --> 03:25:52.510
- 42.
- 42?

1938
03:25:53.980 --> 03:25:58.747
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

1939
03:25:59.552 --> 03:26:03.215
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1940
03:26:07.327 --> 03:26:10.626
- 43.
- He was already dead.

1941
03:26:11.397 --> 03:26:13.888
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1942
03:26:14.067 --> 03:26:18.766
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

1943
03:26:21.007 --> 03:26:25.706
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1944
03:26:25.979 --> 03:26:29.506
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

1945
03:26:29.682 --> 03:26:32.651
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1946
03:26:32.819 --> 03:26:35.652
I hear the staff are very good.

1947
03:26:41.327 --> 03:26:43.693
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1948
03:26:43.863 --> 03:26:48.129
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1949
03:26:48.301 --> 03:26:49.529
I'm starving.

1950
03:26:49.736 --> 03:26:52.796
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

1951
03:26:53.006 --> 03:26:56.032
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1952
03:27:20.033 --> 03:27:22.433
Saruman's storeroom!

1953
03:27:24.804 --> 03:27:27.500
I don't believe it.

1954
03:27:27.707 --> 03:27:29.732
It can't be.

1955
03:27:30.376 --> 03:27:33.277
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1956
03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:36.878
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1957
03:27:37.250 --> 03:27:40.276
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1958
03:27:40.453 --> 03:27:41.579
Wait.

1959
03:27:42.322 --> 03:27:43.550
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

1960
03:27:43.723 --> 03:27:45.247
Share it?

1961
03:27:47.093 --> 03:27:49.493
No. No.

1962
03:27:50.997 --> 03:27:52.328
Dead plant and all that.

1963
03:27:52.765 --> 03:27:54.926
Don't think he'd understand.

1964
03:27:56.235 --> 03:27:58.396
Could be a distant relative.

1965
03:27:59.205 --> 03:28:01.696
I get it.

1966
03:28:01.908 --> 03:28:04.706
Don't be hasty.

1967
03:28:05.812 --> 03:28:07.575
Exactly.

1968
03:28:08.648 --> 03:28:10.912
Bar-hrum.

1969
03:28:36.576 --> 03:28:37.873
This is the old sewer.

1970
03:28:38.044 --> 03:28:41.104
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1971
03:28:41.280 --> 03:28:43.009
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1972
03:28:44.083 --> 03:28:46.551
Captain Faramir...

1973
03:28:47.186 --> 03:28:49.017
you have shown your quality, sir.

1974
03:28:51.524 --> 03:28:52.821
The very highest.

1975
03:28:53.326 --> 03:28:55.954
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

1976
03:28:56.129 --> 03:28:59.064
where gardeners are held in high honor.

1977
03:29:00.266 --> 03:29:02.234
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

1978
03:29:02.869 --> 03:29:04.393
Gollum says there's a path...

1979
03:29:04.604 --> 03:29:08.540
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

1980
03:29:09.008 --> 03:29:10.737
Cirith Ungol?

1981
03:29:14.280 --> 03:29:16.840
- Is that its name?
- No.

1982
03:29:17.016 --> 03:29:18.677
No!

1983
03:29:19.519 --> 03:29:22.511
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1984
03:29:22.889 --> 03:29:26.416
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1985
03:29:27.326 --> 03:29:29.851
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1986
03:29:30.196 --> 03:29:36.465
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

1987
03:29:38.004 --> 03:29:39.767
I must.

1988
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:46.870
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1989
03:29:47.046 --> 03:29:49.071
Thank you.

1990
03:30:00.893 --> 03:30:05.023
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

1991
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:19.034
Come on, keep up.

1992
03:30:22.515 --> 03:30:25.313
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

1993
03:30:25.952 --> 03:30:27.783
You know that, don't you?

1994
03:30:28.588 --> 03:30:30.146
He was trying to save you, see?

1995
03:30:30.656 --> 03:30:32.180
Save me?

1996
03:30:32.525 --> 03:30:34.686
So there's no hard feelings.

1997
03:30:34.861 --> 03:30:39.924
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1998
03:30:40.099 --> 03:30:42.727
Gollum, Gollum.

1999
03:30:43.803 --> 03:30:45.532
Yes, master.

2000
03:30:46.639 --> 03:30:49.472
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2001
03:30:49.642 --> 03:30:51.940
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2002
03:30:57.450 --> 03:31:02.649
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

2003
03:31:09.795 --> 03:31:12.787
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2004
03:31:13.466 --> 03:31:16.993
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

2005
03:31:22.175 --> 03:31:25.611
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

2006
03:31:26.579 --> 03:31:29.810
somewhere in the wilderness.

2007
03:31:33.119 --> 03:31:36.520
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

2008
03:31:36.689 --> 03:31:38.054
What?

2009
03:31:38.224 --> 03:31:42.126
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2010
03:31:42.295 --> 03:31:45.560
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

2011
03:31:45.731 --> 03:31:48.666
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

2012
03:31:48.834 --> 03:31:50.495
"Yes, my boy.

2013
03:31:50.703 --> 03:31:54.503
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2014
03:31:54.674 --> 03:31:57.165
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

2015
03:31:57.376 --> 03:31:59.276
"Samwise the Brave."

2016
03:31:59.445 --> 03:32:02.175
I want to hear more about Sam.

2017
03:32:06.485 --> 03:32:09.477
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

2018
03:32:10.823 --> 03:32:14.850
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

2019
03:32:15.962 --> 03:32:17.327
So was I.

2020
03:32:26.239 --> 03:32:28.901
"Samwise the Brave."

2021
03:32:33.212 --> 03:32:34.543
Smeagol?

2022
03:32:34.714 --> 03:32:37.615
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

2023
03:32:37.783 --> 03:32:39.717
Master.

2024
03:32:39.885 --> 03:32:42.786
Master looks after us.

2025
03:32:43.556 --> 03:32:46.354
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2026
03:32:46.525 --> 03:32:48.993
Master broke his promise.

2027
03:32:49.161 --> 03:32:51.322
Don't ask Smeagol.

2028
03:32:51.497 --> 03:32:54.694
Poor, poor Smeagol.

2029
03:32:54.867 --> 03:32:57.700
Master betrayed us.

2030
03:32:57.903 --> 03:33:00.963
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2031
03:33:01.173 --> 03:33:05.075
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

2032
03:33:05.244 --> 03:33:07.974
Kill him! Kill him!

2033
03:33:08.147 --> 03:33:09.637
Kill them both!

2034
03:33:09.815 --> 03:33:13.444
And then we take the precious...

2035
03:33:13.619 --> 03:33:17.146
and we be the master!

2036
03:33:17.823 --> 03:33:20.485
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2037
03:33:20.660 --> 03:33:23.322
Eyes always watching.

2038
03:33:23.496 --> 03:33:27.057
Then we stabs them out.

2039
03:33:27.233 --> 03:33:31.727
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

2040
03:33:31.937 --> 03:33:35.373
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2041
03:33:35.574 --> 03:33:38.270
Kill them both.

2042
03:33:38.444 --> 03:33:40.844
Yes. No! No!

2043
03:33:41.047 --> 03:33:44.744
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2044
03:33:45.451 --> 03:33:48.045
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2045
03:33:48.220 --> 03:33:50.814
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

2046
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:56.394
We could let her do it.

2047
03:33:57.363 --> 03:34:01.493
Yes. She could do it.

2048
03:34:01.667 --> 03:34:06.229
Yes, precious, she could.

2049
03:34:06.439 --> 03:34:12.435
And then we takes it once they're dead.

2050
03:34:13.412 --> 03:34:16.245
Once they're dead.

2051
03:34:20.653 --> 03:34:24.350
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2052
03:34:24.523 --> 03:34:26.582
Smeagol will show you the way.

2053
03:34:26.759 --> 03:34:28.989
Follow me.
