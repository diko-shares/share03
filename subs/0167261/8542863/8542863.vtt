00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:20.455
Gandalf: You cannot pass!
Frodo: Gandalf!

2
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:30.632
Gandalf: I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of anor.

3
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:41.351
Go back to the shadow.

4
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.064
The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of ude/h!

5
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.489
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.393
Boromir: No! No!

7
00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.780
Fly, you fools.

8
00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:55.110
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

9
00:03:56.987 --> 00:03:58.739
Nothing.

10
00:04:06.037 --> 00:04:08.123
Just a dream.

11
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.471
Can you see the bottom?

12
00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:26.892
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

13
00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.863
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

14
00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:49.247
I think I've found the bottom.

15
00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.672
Sam: Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

16
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:01.051
It's not natural. None of it.

17
00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.306
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

18
00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:08.725
Just a bit of seasoning.

19
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.187
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

20
00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:14.856
Roast chicken?!

21
00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.733
You never know.

22
00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:20.195
Sam. My dear Sam.

23
00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:25.784
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the shire.

24
00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.037
It is special.

25
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.835
It's a little bit of home.

26
00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.549
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

27
00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.511
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

28
00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.224
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

29
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.810
Real elvish rope.

30
00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:55.146
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

31
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.232
Won't come free in a hurry.

32
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.326
Real elvish rope.

33
00:06:22.424 --> 00:06:26.970
Mordor. The one place in middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

34
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.306
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

35
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.808
It's just where we can't get.

36
00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:36.271
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

37
00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:41.318
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

38
00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:46.281
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

39
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.575
But they did.

40
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.672
Mr. Frodo?

41
00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.011
It's the ring, isn't it?

42
00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:11.598
It's getting heavier.

43
00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.947
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

44
00:07:27.656 --> 00:07:29.783
Oh, yes. Lovely.

45
00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:32.661
Lembas bread. And look!

46
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:37.374
More iembas bread.

47
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.095
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

48
00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:53.264
But this elvish stuff, it's not bad.

49
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.644
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

50
00:08:03.483 --> 00:08:05.777
Those rain clouds might.

51
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.814
Sam:
This looks strangely familiar.

52
00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:45.942
It's because we've been here before.

53
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.653
We're going in circles.

54
00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.281
Sam: What is that horrid stink?

55
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.658
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

56
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.702
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

57
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.998
I can smell it.

58
00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.712
We're not alone.

59
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.480
The thieves. The thieves.

60
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.567
The filthy little thieves.

61
00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.445
Where is it?

62
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.281
Where is it?

63
00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.243
They stole it from us.

64
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:41.581
My precious.

65
00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:45.752
Curse them, we hates them!

66
00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.964
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

67
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.896
This is sting.

68
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.565
You've seen it before...

69
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.192
Haven't you, gollum?

70
00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.741
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

71
00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:16.634
It burns!

72
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.053
It burns us!

73
00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.015
It freezes!

74
00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:26.102
Nasty elves twisted it.

75
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.897
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

76
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:36.613
It's hopeless. Every orc in mordor's
going to hear this racket.

77
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.365
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

78
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.997
It's no more than you deserve!

79
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:49.709
Maybe he does deserve to die.

80
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:55.590
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

81
00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.890
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

82
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.893
Take it off us.

83
00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:13.983
We swears to do what you wants.

84
00:12:14.067 --> 00:12:16.069
We swears.

85
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.780
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

86
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.326
We swears...

87
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:28.206
To serve the master
of the precious.

88
00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.210
We will swear on...

89
00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:34.337
On the precious.

90
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.714
Gollum. Gollum.

91
00:12:36.798 --> 00:12:40.969
The ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

92
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:46.224
On the precious.

93
00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:51.020
On the precious.

94
00:12:52.188 --> 00:12:53.690
I don't believe you!

95
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:59.279
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

96
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.155
He's trying to trick us.

97
00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:04.367
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

98
00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:20.300
- You know the way to mordor?
- Yes.

99
00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.971
You've been there before?

100
00:13:38.443 --> 00:13:41.070
You will lead us to the black gate.

101
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:53.583
Smeagol: To the gate, to the gate!
To the gate, the master says. Yes!

102
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:58.588
Gollum: No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

103
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:03.009
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

104
00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.637
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

105
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:12.769
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

106
00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.813
And orcses, thousands of orcses.

107
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:21.069
And always the great eye watching,
watching.

108
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.867
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

109
00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.538
There! What did I tell you?

110
00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:34.916
He's run off, the old villain.

111
00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.627
So much for his promises.

112
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.462
Smeagol: This way, hobbits.

113
00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.672
Follow me!

114
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:56.896
Pippin: Merry!

115
00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.357
Merry!

116
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:08.741
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

117
00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.701
He wants the shire-rats now.

118
00:15:11.536 --> 00:15:16.124
I don't take orders from ore-maggots.

119
00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:20.294
Saruman will have his prize.

120
00:15:20.378 --> 00:15:23.589
We will deliver them.

121
00:15:29.804 --> 00:15:31.180
Merry!

122
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.683
Merry? Wake up.

123
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:39.021
My friend is sick.

124
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.108
He needs water. Please!

125
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:46.863
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

126
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.701
Stop it!

127
00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.539
Can't take his draught!

128
00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:01.836
-Leave him alone! â€”why?

129
00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:05.339
You want some? Huh?

130
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.843
Then keep your mouth shut.

131
00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.348
Merry.

132
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:16.684
Hello, pip.

133
00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:20.980
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

134
00:16:21.063 --> 00:16:23.649
- It was just an act.
- An act?

135
00:16:24.275 --> 00:16:27.153
See? I fooled you too.

136
00:16:29.864 --> 00:16:31.574
Don't worry about me, pippin.

137
00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:35.870
What is it? What do you smell?

138
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:38.164
Man-flesh.

139
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.668
They've picked up our trail.

140
00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:44.879
Aragorn.

141
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.424
Let's move!

142
00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.534
Their pace has quickened.

143
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.578
They must have caught our scent.

144
00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:19.455
Hurry!

145
00:17:23.084 --> 00:17:24.877
Come on, gimli!

146
00:17:28.673 --> 00:17:31.008
Three days and nights pursuit.

147
00:17:31.092 --> 00:17:34.136
No food. No rest.

148
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.266
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

149
00:18:09.714 --> 00:18:12.967
Not idly do the leaves of lorien fall.

150
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.596
They may yet be alive.

151
00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.099
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

152
00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:25.229
Come, gimli! We're gaining on them!

153
00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:29.650
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We dwarves are natural sprinters.

154
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.487
Very dangerous over short distances.

155
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:46.959
Aragorn: Rohan.

156
00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:49.879
Home of the horse-lords.

157
00:18:51.088 --> 00:18:53.674
There's something strange at work here.

158
00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.886
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

159
00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.930
Sets its will against us.

160
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.064
Aragorn:
Legolas! What do your elf-eyes see?

161
00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:10.775
Legolas:
The uruks turn northeast.

162
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.778
They are taking the hobbits to isengard.

163
00:19:14.654 --> 00:19:15.905
Saruman.

164
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.541
Saru man: The world is changing.

165
00:19:27.625 --> 00:19:33.297
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of isengard...

166
00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:36.717
And mordor?

167
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:44.058
To stand against the might of Sauron
and saruman...

168
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:47.853
And the union of the two towers?

169
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.363
Together, my lord Sauron...

170
00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:01.075
We shall rule this middle-earth.

171
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:21.345
Saru man: The old world will burn
in the fires of industry.

172
00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.182
The forests will fall.

173
00:20:27.101 --> 00:20:29.937
A new order will rise.

174
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:35.985
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

175
00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:40.114
And the iron fists of the orc.

176
00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:55.796
Saruman: I want them armed
and ready to march within two weeks!

177
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.631
Orc:
But, my lord, there are too many!

178
00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.801
We cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

179
00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:04.138
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

180
00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:07.141
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

181
00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:12.730
The forest of fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

182
00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.484
- Burn it.
- Yes.

183
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.528
Wild man: We will fight for you.

184
00:21:19.612 --> 00:21:21.655
Swear it.

185
00:21:32.166 --> 00:21:36.921
We will die for saruman.

186
00:21:38.005 --> 00:21:40.049
Saru man:
The horse-men took your lands.

187
00:21:40.132 --> 00:21:44.762
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

188
00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.305
Murderers!

189
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:49.391
Saruman:
Take back the lands they stole from you.

190
00:21:49.475 --> 00:21:51.310
Burn every village!

191
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:59.693
Saru man: We have only to
remove those who oppose us.

192
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.738
It will begin in Rohan.

193
00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:07.076
Too long have these peasants
stood against you.

194
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.078
But no more.

195
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:11.413
Eothain! Eothain!

196
00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:16.252
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

197
00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:19.338
Freda:
Papa says eothain must not ride garulf.

198
00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.173
He is too big for him.

199
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:24.343
Listen to me. You must ride to edoras
and raise the alarm.

200
00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:27.012
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, mama.

201
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:30.224
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, mama.

202
00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:34.103
Freda, I will find you there.

203
00:22:38.983 --> 00:22:40.734
Quickly!

204
00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:48.659
Go, child.

205
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:03.507
Saru man: Rohan, my lord...

206
00:23:03.924 --> 00:23:06.760
Is ready to fall.

207
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.275
Find the king's son!

208
00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:43.797
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These orcs are not from mordor.

209
00:23:44.632 --> 00:23:47.468
My lord eomer, over here!

210
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.978
He's alive.

211
00:24:44.358 --> 00:24:47.403
Eowyn:
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

212
00:24:47.861 --> 00:24:50.364
He was ambushed by orcs.

213
00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:55.494
If we don't defend our country,
saruman will take it by force.

214
00:24:55.869 --> 00:24:58.372
That is a lie.

215
00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:05.421
Saruman the white has ever been
our friend and ally.

216
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:09.091
Theoden: Grima.

217
00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:12.428
Grima.

218
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.515
Grima.

219
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:20.394
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

220
00:25:20.728 --> 00:25:24.398
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

221
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:27.901
Orcs bearing the white hand of saruman.

222
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:41.582
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

223
00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:44.209
Can you not see?

224
00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:49.423
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

225
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:52.092
Your warmongering.

226
00:25:54.303 --> 00:25:56.305
Warmongering?

227
00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.599
How long is it since
saruman bought you?

228
00:25:59.433 --> 00:26:01.810
What was the promised price, grima?

229
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:05.731
When all the men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

230
00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.871
Too long have you watched my sister.

231
00:26:20.954 --> 00:26:22.998
Too long have you haunted her steps.

232
00:26:31.048 --> 00:26:35.427
You see much, eomer, son of eomund.

233
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:36.720
Too much.

234
00:26:39.014 --> 00:26:43.894
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

235
00:26:43.977 --> 00:26:48.816
And all its domains
under pain of death.

236
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.652
You have no authority here.

237
00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:54.238
Your orders mean nothing.

238
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.659
This order does not come from me.

239
00:26:58.742 --> 00:27:00.994
It comes from the king.

240
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:04.206
He signed it this morning.

241
00:27:35.737 --> 00:27:38.532
Keep breathing. That's the key.

242
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:40.367
Breathe.

243
00:27:44.538 --> 00:27:48.333
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

244
00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.560
Orc 1:
We're not going no further...

245
00:28:06.643 --> 00:28:08.687
Until we've had a breather.

246
00:28:09.229 --> 00:28:11.190
Get a fire going!

247
00:28:15.277 --> 00:28:16.862
Merry!

248
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:18.572
Merry!

249
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:25.454
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the shire, pippin.

250
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.090
What's making that noise?

251
00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.135
It's the trees.

252
00:28:40.886 --> 00:28:41.929
What?

253
00:28:42.262 --> 00:28:46.141
You remember the old forest,
on the borders of buckland?

254
00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:50.812
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

255
00:28:50.896 --> 00:28:52.481
And come alive.

256
00:28:52.731 --> 00:28:54.399
Alive?

257
00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:56.985
Trees that could whisper...

258
00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.489
Talk to each other...

259
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.491
Even move.

260
00:29:04.117 --> 00:29:06.370
I'm starving.

261
00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:10.582
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

262
00:29:12.376 --> 00:29:15.671
Why can't we have some meat?!

263
00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:20.300
What about them?

264
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:22.302
They're fresh.

265
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.765
They are not for eating.

266
00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:34.731
What about their legs?

267
00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:37.192
They don't need those.

268
00:29:38.652 --> 00:29:41.822
- They look tasty.
- Leader: Get back, scum!

269
00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:48.537
The prisoners go to saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

270
00:29:48.912 --> 00:29:50.831
Alive?

271
00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:58.088
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

272
00:30:00.465 --> 00:30:03.885
They have something.
An elvish weapon.

273
00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:07.055
The master wants it for the war.

274
00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:11.852
- They think we have the ring.
- Shh.

275
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:14.396
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

276
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.275
Just a mouthful...

277
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:19.609
A bit of the flank.

278
00:30:26.408 --> 00:30:30.078
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

279
00:30:36.585 --> 00:30:37.878
Pippin.

280
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.713
Let's go.

281
00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:49.723
Go on.

282
00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.350
Call for help.

283
00:30:52.726 --> 00:30:53.894
Squeal

284
00:30:53.977 --> 00:30:57.230
no one's going to save you now.

285
00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:07.824
Merry: Pippin!

286
00:31:32.057 --> 00:31:34.559
A red sun rises.

287
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.979
Blood has been spilled this night.

288
00:32:09.219 --> 00:32:11.096
Riders of Rohan...

289
00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:13.932
What news from the Mark?

290
00:32:41.668 --> 00:32:46.089
What business does an elf, a man
and a dwarf have in the riddermark?

291
00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:48.133
Speak quickly!

292
00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:53.138
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

293
00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:04.858
I would cut off your head, dwarf...

294
00:33:05.358 --> 00:33:07.652
If it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

295
00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:10.780
You would die before your stroke fell.

296
00:33:19.498 --> 00:33:21.374
I am aragorn, son of arathorn.

297
00:33:21.708 --> 00:33:25.962
This is gimli, son of glÃ©in,
and Legolas of the woodland realm.

298
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:29.382
We are friends of Rohan
and of thÃ©oden, your king.

299
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:34.888
ThÃ©oden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

300
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:37.224
Not even his own kin.

301
00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:43.772
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

302
00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.815
And claimed lordship over these lands.

303
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:50.820
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

304
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:52.697
And for that, we are banished.

305
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:58.078
The white wizard is cunning.

306
00:33:58.745 --> 00:34:01.206
He walks here and there, they say...

307
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.416
As an old man hooded and cloaked.

308
00:34:05.252 --> 00:34:09.089
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

309
00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:11.466
We are no spies.

310
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.553
We track a party of uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

311
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:17.180
They have taken two of our friends
capfive.

312
00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:20.475
The uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

313
00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:23.812
But there were two hobbits.
Did you see two hobbits with them?

314
00:34:23.895 --> 00:34:26.940
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

315
00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:32.237
We left none alive.

316
00:34:32.946 --> 00:34:35.824
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

317
00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:42.539
Dead?

318
00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:47.252
I am sorry.

319
00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:55.093
Hasufel! Arod!

320
00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:01.600
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

321
00:35:02.851 --> 00:35:04.477
Farewell.

322
00:35:09.608 --> 00:35:11.901
Look for your friends.

323
00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.571
But do not trust to hope.

324
00:35:16.281 --> 00:35:18.908
It has forsaken these lands.

325
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.546
It's one of their wee belts.

326
00:36:27.268 --> 00:36:29.312
We failed them.

327
00:36:43.368 --> 00:36:45.578
A hobbit lay here.

328
00:36:47.414 --> 00:36:49.082
And the other.

329
00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.428
They crawled.

330
00:37:05.598 --> 00:37:07.726
Their hands were bound.

331
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:21.698
Their bonds were cut.

332
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.257
They ran over here.

333
00:37:42.927 --> 00:37:44.137
They were followed.

334
00:37:47.307 --> 00:37:49.058
Merry: The belt!

335
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.176
Tracks lead away from the battle...

336
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.159
Into fangorn forest.

337
00:38:06.993 --> 00:38:08.536
Fangorn?

338
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.247
What madness drove them in there?

339
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:31.976
Pippin:
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

340
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:42.111
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

341
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:49.327
Come here!

342
00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.418
Trees. Climb a tree.

343
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.513
He's gone.

344
00:39:20.567 --> 00:39:22.902
Merry!

345
00:39:34.372 --> 00:39:38.751
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

346
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.427
Run, merry!

347
00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.649
Little orcs.

348
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.152
It's talking, merry.
The tree is talking.

349
00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:06.154
Tree?

350
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:09.365
I am no tree!

351
00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:11.701
I am an ent.

352
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:14.412
A tree-herder.

353
00:40:14.913 --> 00:40:16.956
A Shepherd of the forest.

354
00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.416
Don't talk to it, merry.

355
00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:20.460
Don't encourage it!

356
00:40:20.543 --> 00:40:24.881
Treebeard, some call me.

357
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:26.966
And whose side are you on?

358
00:40:29.385 --> 00:40:32.305
I am on nobody's side...

359
00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:37.977
Because nobody's on my side,
little orc.

360
00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:43.441
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

361
00:40:43.816 --> 00:40:46.235
We're not orcs! We're hobbits!

362
00:40:46.319 --> 00:40:48.655
Hobbits?

363
00:40:49.906 --> 00:40:54.827
Never heard of a hobbit before.

364
00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:59.290
Sounds like orc mischief to me!

365
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.919
They come with fire.

366
00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.713
They come with axes.

367
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:10.718
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

368
00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:14.722
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

369
00:41:14.806 --> 00:41:17.725
You don't understand. We're hobbits!

370
00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:19.727
Halflings!

371
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:21.020
Shire-folk!

372
00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:23.481
Maybe you are...

373
00:41:23.773 --> 00:41:27.402
And maybe you aren't.

374
00:41:33.199 --> 00:41:35.159
The white wizard?

375
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.162
Saruman.

376
00:41:50.717 --> 00:41:52.510
Gollum: See? See?

377
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:55.054
We've led you out.

378
00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:57.724
Hurry, hobbitses. Hurry!

379
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.396
Very lucky we find you.

380
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.738
Nice hobbit.

381
00:42:13.406 --> 00:42:17.952
Oh! It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

382
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.705
A swamp, yes, yes.

383
00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:26.210
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

384
00:42:28.504 --> 00:42:31.966
Come, hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

385
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.930
I found it. I did.

386
00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:40.808
The way through the marshes.

387
00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:44.479
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

388
00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:48.691
They go around for miles and miles.

389
00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:50.401
Come quickly.

390
00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:54.572
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

391
00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.118
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

392
00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:01.537
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

393
00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:05.083
No, no birdses to eat.

394
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:09.587
No crunchable birdses.

395
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:13.091
And we are famished! Yes!

396
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:17.512
Famished we are, precious!

397
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:33.986
Here.

398
00:43:35.154 --> 00:43:37.240
Gollum: What does it eats?

399
00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:39.325
Is it tasty?

400
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:47.250
It tries to chokes us!

401
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:51.170
We can't eats hobbit food!

402
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.968
We must starve!

403
00:43:57.051 --> 00:43:59.512
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

404
00:44:00.221 --> 00:44:02.515
Oh, cruel hobbit.

405
00:44:02.598 --> 00:44:05.601
It does not care if we be hungry.

406
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:10.523
Does not care if we should die.

407
00:44:11.107 --> 00:44:13.943
Not like master.

408
00:44:15.319 --> 00:44:17.405
Master cares.

409
00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.449
Master knows.

410
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.665
Precious.

411
00:44:31.252 --> 00:44:34.881
Once it takes hold of us...

412
00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:40.928
It never lets go.

413
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:42.763
Don't touch me!

414
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:17.173
Sam: There are dead things!

415
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:19.091
Dead faces in the water.

416
00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:27.892
Gollum: All dead. All rotten.

417
00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:32.230
Elves and men and orcses.

418
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:35.983
A great battle long ago.

419
00:45:36.776 --> 00:45:38.611
Dead marshes.

420
00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:41.447
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

421
00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:44.992
This way.

422
00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:47.828
Don't follow the lights.

423
00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:53.501
Careful now! Or hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

424
00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:57.755
And light little candles
of their own.

425
00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:14.665
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

426
00:47:14.749 --> 00:47:16.584
- Frodo: Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

427
00:47:16.834 --> 00:47:18.711
Are you all right?

428
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.618
Gollum: So bright.

429
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:54.622
So beautiful.

430
00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:58.542
Our precious.

431
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:01.462
What did you say?

432
00:48:01.754 --> 00:48:03.964
Master should be resting.

433
00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:08.177
Master needs to keep up his strength.

434
00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:13.432
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

435
00:48:13.516 --> 00:48:15.101
Gollum. Gollum.

436
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:17.144
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

437
00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:21.357
Cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travelers far from home

438
00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.150
he said your life was a sad story.

439
00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:27.822
They do not see what lies ahead
when sun has failed and moon is dead

440
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.991
you were not so very different
from a hobbit once.

441
00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.910
Were you?

442
00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:37.331
SmÃ©agol.

443
00:48:42.044 --> 00:48:44.588
What did you call me?

444
00:48:45.923 --> 00:48:48.676
That was your name once, wasn't it?

445
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:51.595
A long time ago.

446
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:54.598
My name.

447
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:57.184
My name.

448
00:49:04.108 --> 00:49:06.610
SmÃ©agol.

449
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.755
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

450
00:49:26.839 --> 00:49:30.509
Smeagol: Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

451
00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:34.013
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

452
00:49:34.096 --> 00:49:37.057
No, you cannot kill them. No.

453
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.377
Smeagol: Wraiths!

454
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:07.713
Wraiths on wings!

455
00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.848
They are calling for it.

456
00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:21.435
They are calling for the precious.

457
00:50:23.646 --> 00:50:25.814
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

458
00:50:25.898 --> 00:50:27.191
I'm here.

459
00:50:43.207 --> 00:50:44.750
Smeagol: Hurry, hobbits.

460
00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:49.213
The black gate is very close.

461
00:50:56.053 --> 00:50:57.972
Orc blood.

462
00:51:07.982 --> 00:51:09.733
These are strange tracks.

463
00:51:11.026 --> 00:51:12.987
The air is so close in here.

464
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.615
This forest is old.

465
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:19.451
Very old.

466
00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:23.455
Full of memory...

467
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.460
And anger.

468
00:51:34.592 --> 00:51:37.511
The trees are speaking to each other.

469
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.179
Aragorn: Gimli!

470
00:51:39.263 --> 00:51:41.265
Lower your ax.

471
00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:46.812
They have feelings, my friend.

472
00:51:47.354 --> 00:51:49.398
The elves began it.

473
00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:54.278
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

474
00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.114
Talking trees.

475
00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.868
What do trees have to talk about?

476
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:04.204
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

477
00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.596
The white wizard approaches.

478
00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:31.065
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

479
00:52:40.658 --> 00:52:42.910
We must be quick.

480
00:52:58.467 --> 00:53:02.137
White wizard: You are tracking
the footsteps of two young hobbits.

481
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:04.181
Where are they?

482
00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:07.935
White wizard: They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

483
00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:12.356
They met someone they did not expect.

484
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.650
Does that comfort you?

485
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:16.735
Who are you?

486
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.197
Show yourself!

487
00:53:29.081 --> 00:53:31.083
It cannot be.

488
00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.087
Forgive me.

489
00:53:36.672 --> 00:53:38.590
I mistook you for saruman.

490
00:53:39.383 --> 00:53:42.136
I am saruman.

491
00:53:43.679 --> 00:53:47.599
Or rather, saruman
as he should have been.

492
00:53:48.517 --> 00:53:50.018
You fell.

493
00:53:51.478 --> 00:53:54.064
Through fire...

494
00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:55.482
And water.

495
00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:59.528
From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...

496
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:03.407
I fought with the balrog
of morgoth.

497
00:54:19.256 --> 00:54:22.009
Gandalf: Until at last
I threw down my enemy...

498
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:26.638
And smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.

499
00:54:32.644 --> 00:54:35.189
Darkness took me...

500
00:54:35.939 --> 00:54:40.027
And I strayed out of thought
and time.

501
00:54:40.778 --> 00:54:43.864
Stars wheeled overhead...

502
00:54:44.156 --> 00:54:48.660
And every day was as long
as a life age of the earth.

503
00:54:50.746 --> 00:54:52.873
But it was not the end.

504
00:54:53.165 --> 00:54:55.959
I felt life in me again.

505
00:54:57.878 --> 00:55:00.464
I've been sent back...

506
00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:02.174
Until my task is done.

507
00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:13.936
That was what they used to call me.

508
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:19.066
Gandalf the grey.

509
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.277
That was my name.

510
00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.825
I am Gandalf the white.

511
00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:33.956
And I come back to you now...

512
00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:36.583
At the turn of the tide.

513
00:55:37.709 --> 00:55:40.712
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

514
00:55:41.421 --> 00:55:44.591
- We must travel to edoras with all speed.
- Gimli: Edoras?

515
00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:47.553
That is no short distance!

516
00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:51.098
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

517
00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:53.350
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

518
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:56.937
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

519
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.106
Are we to leave those poor hobbits here...

520
00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:03.193
In this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

521
00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:09.283
I mean, charming...

522
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.160
Quite charming forest.

523
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:16.415
It was more than mere chance that
brought merry and pippin to fangorn.

524
00:56:16.498 --> 00:56:20.919
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

525
00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:24.548
The coming of merry and pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

526
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:28.051
That starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

527
00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:30.387
In one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

528
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:34.933
- Hm?
- You still speak in riddles.

529
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:44.234
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the elder days.

530
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:47.988
The ents are going to wake up...

531
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:53.035
- And find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

532
00:56:53.785 --> 00:56:54.995
Oh, that's good.

533
00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.831
So stop your fretting, master dwarf.

534
00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:01.209
Merry and pippin are quite safe.

535
00:57:01.293 --> 00:57:05.047
In fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

536
00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:08.926
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

537
00:57:31.156 --> 00:57:32.699
That is one of the mearas...

538
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:35.577
Unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

539
00:57:53.178 --> 00:57:55.472
Gandalf: Shadowfax.

540
00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:00.644
He is the lord of all horses...

541
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:06.191
And has been my friend
through many dangers.

542
00:58:20.455 --> 00:58:24.084
Treebeard: O Rowan mine

543
00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:28.046
I saw you shine

544
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:31.717
upon a summer's day

545
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:37.347
upon your head how golden-red

546
00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:42.269
the crown you bore aloft

547
00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.813
such a beautiful verse.

548
00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:49.901
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

549
00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:53.280
You might call it far, perhaps.

550
00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:58.076
My home lies deep in the forest...

551
00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.080
Near the roots of the mountain.

552
00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:07.169
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

553
00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:11.298
And safe is where I'll keep you.

554
00:59:11.548 --> 00:59:15.927
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

555
00:59:16.303 --> 00:59:19.347
It's one of my own compositions.

556
00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.724
Right.

557
00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:27.022
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

558
00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:32.069
and the dreams of trees unfold

559
00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:38.700
when woodland halls are green and cool

560
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:46.041
come back to me

561
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:51.088
come back to me

562
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:57.636
and say my land is best

563
01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:08.855
Sleep, little shirelings.

564
01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.567
Heed no nightly noise.

565
01:00:12.651 --> 01:00:16.613
Sleep till morning light.

566
01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:22.452
I have business in the forest.

567
01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:28.125
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

568
01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:34.047
The shadow lies on fangorn.

569
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:39.886
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

570
01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:53.692
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

571
01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:57.112
Sauron will suffer no rival.

572
01:00:57.529 --> 01:01:01.908
From the summit of barad-dur,
his eye watches ceaselessly.

573
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.412
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

574
01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.456
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

575
01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.209
The rumor has reached him.

576
01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:14.296
The heir of numenor still lives.

577
01:01:15.255 --> 01:01:18.091
Sauron fears you, aragorn.

578
01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.595
He fears what you may become.

579
01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:26.308
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of men.

580
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:30.103
He will use his puppet, saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

581
01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.771
War is coming.

582
01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.525
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

583
01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.111
For Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

584
01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.990
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of saruman's.

585
01:01:42.073 --> 01:01:45.243
His hold over king thÃ©oden
is now very strong.

586
01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:50.081
Sauron and saruman
are tightening the noose.

587
01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.084
But for all their cunning...

588
01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:55.795
We have one advantage.

589
01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:00.508
The ring remains hidden.

590
01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:03.553
And that we should seek to destroy it...

591
01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.640
Has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

592
01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.602
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards mordor...

593
01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.270
In the hands of a hobbit.

594
01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:16.524
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of mount doom.

595
01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:19.319
We must trust now in Frodo.

596
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.321
Everything depends upon speed...

597
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.449
And the secrecy of his quest.

598
01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.746
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

599
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:33.375
Frodo must finish this task alone.

600
01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.503
He's not alone.

601
01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.296
Sam went with him.

602
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.215
Did he?

603
01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:44.970
Did he, indeed? Good.

604
01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:48.014
Yes, very good.

605
01:02:56.022 --> 01:03:00.902
Smeagol:
The black gate of mordor.

606
01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.199
Oh, save us.

607
01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.208
My old gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

608
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.965
Smeagol: Master says to
show him the way into mordor.

609
01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:25.552
So good smÃ©agol does,
master says so.

610
01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.689
That's it, then.

611
01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.525
We can't get past that.

612
01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:28.740
The gate.

613
01:04:28.823 --> 01:04:30.075
It's opening!

614
01:04:37.499 --> 01:04:39.501
I can see a way down.

615
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.337
Sam, no!

616
01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.882
Master!

617
01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:13.261
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

618
01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:17.182
I doubt even these elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

619
01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.476
Now! Smeagol: No!

620
01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:21.936
No! No, master!

621
01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.190
They catch you! They catch you!

622
01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.027
Don't take it to him.

623
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.741
He wants the precious.

624
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.952
Always he is looking for it.

625
01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:42.081
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

626
01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:46.127
But we mustn't let him have it.

627
01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:54.677
No! There's another way.

628
01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:57.472
More secret. A dark way.

629
01:06:57.764 --> 01:07:01.434
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

630
01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:03.019
He's up to something.

631
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.272
Are you saying there's another way
into mordor?

632
01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:09.150
Yes. There's a path...

633
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:11.861
And some stairs.

634
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.158
A tunnel.

635
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:32.966
He's led us this far, Sam.

636
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.509
Mr. Frodo, no.

637
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:37.095
He's been true to his word.

638
01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:46.938
Lead the way, smÃ©agol.

639
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.484
Good smÃ©agol always helps.

640
01:08:25.476 --> 01:08:26.477
Hello?

641
01:08:28.896 --> 01:08:30.940
Treebeard?

642
01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.026
Where has he gone?

643
01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.612
Pippin:
I had the loveliest dream last night.

644
01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.990
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

645
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.618
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

646
01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.037
You were sick.

647
01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.499
I'd give anything for a whiff of old Toby.

648
01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:53.921
Did you hear that?

649
01:09:01.012 --> 01:09:02.513
There it is again.

650
01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:06.976
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

651
01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:14.734
You just said something... treeish.

652
01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:18.863
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

653
01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:28.289
You're taller.

654
01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.416
- Who?
- You!

655
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.126
- Than what?
- Than me!

656
01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.796
I've always been taller than you.

657
01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:39.550
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

658
01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.969
Please, merry.

659
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:45.932
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

660
01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.726
Whereas me, I'm pushing 37".

661
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.568
Three-foot-eight.

662
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.490
You did something.

663
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:09.872
Pippin:
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

664
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.333
Merry!

665
01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.836
No, treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

666
01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:18.965
- Merry: I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

667
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:21.217
Give me it back. Merry!

668
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.387
What's happening?!

669
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.723
It's got my leg!

670
01:10:27.098 --> 01:10:28.599
Merry!

671
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.620
Pippin: Help!

672
01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.212
Treebeard: Away with you.

673
01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.131
You should not be waking.

674
01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:05.636
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

675
01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.765
Go to sleep.

676
01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.017
Away with you.

677
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.437
Come, the forest is waking up.

678
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.939
It isn't safe.

679
01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:23.529
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

680
01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.699
Anger festers in their hearts.

681
01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.202
Black are their thoughts.

682
01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.913
Strong is their hate.

683
01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:34.832
They will harm you if they can.

684
01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:38.586
There are too few of us now.

685
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:42.715
Too few of us ents left to manage them.

686
01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.052
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

687
01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.388
- Are there ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

688
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:55.186
There have been no entings
for a terrible long count of years.

689
01:11:55.269 --> 01:12:00.566
- Why is that?
- We lost the entwives.

690
01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.276
Oh, I'm sorry.

691
01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.364
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

692
01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.784
We lost them.

693
01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:15.081
And now we cannot find them.

694
01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:21.420
I don't suppose you've seen entwives
in the shire?

695
01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.131
Can't say that I have.

696
01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:26.717
You, pip?

697
01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.513
What do they look like?

698
01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:37.645
I don't remember now.

699
01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.957
Gandalf: Edoras and the golden hall
of meduseld.

700
01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:01.377
There dwells thÃ©oden, king of Rohan...

701
01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.006
Whose mind is overthrown.

702
01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:09.385
Saruman's hold over king thÃ©oden
is now very strong.

703
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.264
Eowyn: My lord, your son...

704
01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:15.558
He is dead.

705
01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.895
My lord?

706
01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:21.314
Uncle?

707
01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.406
Will you not go to him?

708
01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.953
Will you do nothing?

709
01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.164
Be careful what you say.

710
01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.416
Do not look for welcome here.

711
01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:08.694
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

712
01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.072
What a tragedy for the king...

713
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:14.158
To lose his only son and heir.

714
01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:19.830
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

715
01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:24.919
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

716
01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.504
Leave me alone, snake!

717
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.632
Oh, but you are alone.

718
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:36.055
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

719
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:39.725
In the bitter watches of the night...

720
01:14:39.809 --> 01:14:43.521
When all your life seems to shrink.

721
01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:47.900
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

722
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:52.613
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

723
01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.742
So fair.

724
01:14:57.994 --> 01:14:59.370
So cold.

725
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.457
Like a morning of pale spring...

726
01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:07.003
Still clinging to winter's chill.

727
01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:23.269
Your words are poison.

728
01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:58.280
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

729
01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.507
I cannot allow you before thÃ©oden king
so armed, Gandalf greyhame.

730
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:20.553
By order of grima wormtongue.

731
01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:40.865
- Your staff.
- Hm? Oh...

732
01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:46.537
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

733
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:08.225
My lord, Gandalf the grey is coming.

734
01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.194
He's a herald of woe.

735
01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:22.698
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

736
01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:25.242
ThÃ©oden king.

737
01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:28.495
He's not welcome.

738
01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:34.710
Why should I welcome you...

739
01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:38.964
Gandalf stormcrow?

740
01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:42.468
A just question, my liege.

741
01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.471
Late is the hour...

742
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:49.600
In which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

743
01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.478
Lathspell I name him.

744
01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:55.522
III news is an ill guest.

745
01:18:55.606 --> 01:19:00.277
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

746
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.363
I have not passed
through fire and death...

747
01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.741
To bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

748
01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.869
His staff.

749
01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:13.123
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

750
01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:21.548
Son of thengel...

751
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.678
Too long have you sat
in the shadows.

752
01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:32.017
I would stay still if I were you.

753
01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.186
Hearken to me!

754
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.860
I release you...

755
01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:43.946
From the spell.

756
01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.544
You have no power here...

757
01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:02.339
Gandalf the grey.

758
01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:12.808
I will draw you, saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

759
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.777
Wait.

760
01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:29.033
Saruman's voice:
If I go, thÃ©oden dies.

761
01:20:32.077 --> 01:20:34.330
You will not kill him.

762
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.918
Saru man: Rohan is mine.

763
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.755
Be gone.

764
01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.426
I know your face.

765
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:35.265
Eowyn.

766
01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:38.811
Eowyn.

767
01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.698
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

768
01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:07.673
Dark have been my dreams of late.

769
01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:15.681
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

770
01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.725
If they grasped your sword.

771
01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.898
Wormtongue: I've only...

772
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.109
Ever served you, my lord.

773
01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:14.239
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

774
01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.201
Wormtongue:
Send me not from your sight.

775
01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.289
Aragorn:
No, my lord! No, my lord.

776
01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:23.624
Let him go.

777
01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:27.544
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

778
01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:39.014
Wormtongue: Get out of my way!

779
01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.394
Man: Hail, thÃ©oden king!

780
01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:11.588
Where is thÃ©odred?

781
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:17.094
Where is my son?

782
01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:46.058
Theoden: SimbelmynÃ©.

783
01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:54.816
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

784
01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:01.615
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

785
01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:07.621
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

786
01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:12.793
The young perish and the old linger.

787
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:19.049
To see the last days of my house.

788
01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:24.137
ThÃ©odred's death
was not of your making.

789
01:26:27.182 --> 01:26:30.560
No parent should have to Bury
their child.

790
01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:49.162
Gandalf: He was strong in life.

791
01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:53.834
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

792
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.338
They had no warning.

793
01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.883
They were unarmed.

794
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:47.387
Now the wild men are moving through
the westfold, burning as they go.

795
01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.265
Rick, cot and tree.

796
01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.768
Where is mama? Eowyn: Shh.

797
01:27:53.643 --> 01:27:57.856
This is but a taste of the terror
that saruman will unleash.

798
01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:02.402
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

799
01:28:03.987 --> 01:28:06.990
Ride out and meet him head on.

800
01:28:07.741 --> 01:28:11.244
Draw him away from your women
and children.

801
01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.246
You must fight.

802
01:28:13.330 --> 01:28:17.250
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

803
01:28:17.334 --> 01:28:19.044
Eomer is loyal to you.

804
01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.922
His men will return
and fight for their king.

805
01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:25.967
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

806
01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.848
Eomer cannot help us.

807
01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:34.309
I know what it is you want of me...

808
01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.687
But I will not bring further death
to my people.

809
01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:41.066
I will not risk open war.

810
01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:46.696
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

811
01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.536
Theoden: When last I looked...

812
01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.623
ThÃ©oden, not aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

813
01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.757
Then what is the king's decision?

814
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:12.764
Hama: By order of the king...

815
01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.307
The city must empty.

816
01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:18.353
We make for the refuge of helm's deep.

817
01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:22.607
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

818
01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:24.276
Gimli: Helm's deep.

819
01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:27.988
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

820
01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:30.115
Who will defend them if not their king?

821
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.742
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

822
01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:34.744
Helm's deep has saved them
in the past.

823
01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:38.790
There is no way out of that ravine.
ThÃ©oden is walking into a trap.

824
01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.167
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

825
01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.461
What they will get is a massacre.

826
01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:47.507
ThÃ©oden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

827
01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:51.761
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

828
01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:55.056
He will need you before the end,
aragorn.

829
01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:58.310
The people of Rohan will need you.

830
01:29:58.685 --> 01:30:01.146
The defenses have to hold.

831
01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:04.316
They will hold.

832
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.655
The grey pilgrim.

833
01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:13.450
That's what they used to call me.

834
01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:18.705
Three hundred lives of men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

835
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.500
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

836
01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:26.338
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

837
01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:29.966
At dawn, look to the east.

838
01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:02.332
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

839
01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:43.415
His name is brego.

840
01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.918
He was my cousin's horse.

841
01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:48.878
Brego.

842
01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:06.062
I have heard of the magic of elves...

843
01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:09.482
But I did not look for it
in a ranger from the north.

844
01:32:10.525 --> 01:32:12.944
You speak as one of their own.

845
01:32:14.738 --> 01:32:17.198
I was raised in rivendell...

846
01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.992
For a time.

847
01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:24.330
Turn this fellow free.

848
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:27.459
He's seen enough of war.

849
01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.098
Gandalf the white.

850
01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:44.601
Gandalf the fool!

851
01:32:45.935 --> 01:32:50.190
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

852
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:55.111
Wormtongue: There were three
who followed the wizard.

853
01:32:55.528 --> 01:33:00.867
An elf, a dwarf and a man.

854
01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:04.037
You stink of horse.

855
01:33:13.213 --> 01:33:17.467
- Was he from gondor?
- No, from the north.

856
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:21.429
One of the dt'jnedain rangers,
I thought he was.

857
01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:23.348
His cloth was poor.

858
01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:29.395
And yet he bore a strange ring.

859
01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.067
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

860
01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:40.073
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

861
01:33:40.156 --> 01:33:42.117
Saru man: The ring of barahir.

862
01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:46.704
So Gandalf greyhame
thinks he has found isildur's heir.

863
01:33:46.788 --> 01:33:50.208
The lost king of gondor.
He is a fool.

864
01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:53.086
The line was broken years ago.

865
01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:56.005
It matters not.

866
01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.716
The world of men shall fall.

867
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.718
It will begin at edoras.

868
01:34:09.936 --> 01:34:11.896
I am ready, gamling.

869
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:14.524
Bring my horse.

870
01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:19.028
This is not a defeat.

871
01:34:21.447 --> 01:34:22.657
We will return.

872
01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:30.540
We will return.

873
01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:55.857
You have some skill with a blade.

874
01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:06.492
Women of this country learned long ago:

875
01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.287
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

876
01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.247
I fear neither death nor pain.

877
01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:14.626
What do you fear, my lady?

878
01:35:18.004 --> 01:35:19.839
A cage.

879
01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:25.011
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

880
01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:29.098
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

881
01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:34.520
You're a daughter of kings...

882
01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:39.108
A shieldmaiden of Rohan.

883
01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:46.908
I do not think that would be your fate.

884
01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:23.027
Wormtongue:
ThÃ©oden will not stay at edoras.

885
01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:25.321
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

886
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:28.324
He will expect an attack on the city.

887
01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:32.954
They will flee to helm's deep...

888
01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.415
The great fortress of Rohan.

889
01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:41.004
It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.

890
01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.173
They will be slow.

891
01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:48.970
They will have women and children
with them.

892
01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:55.184
Send out your warg-riders.

893
01:37:09.991 --> 01:37:12.952
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

894
01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:15.788
- Why do you do that?
- What?

895
01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:18.458
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

896
01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.918
Because.

897
01:37:22.462 --> 01:37:24.630
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

898
01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:26.966
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

899
01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:30.219
It's the ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

900
01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:32.638
You have no idea what it did to him...

901
01:37:32.722 --> 01:37:35.266
What it's still doing to him.

902
01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:39.604
I want to help him, Sam.

903
01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.022
Why?

904
01:37:46.319 --> 01:37:49.447
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

905
01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.661
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

906
01:37:55.745 --> 01:37:58.539
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

907
01:38:05.463 --> 01:38:09.675
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

908
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:11.636
I do.

909
01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:15.556
It's the ring.

910
01:38:16.099 --> 01:38:17.683
You can't take your eyes off it.

911
01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:20.395
I've seen you.

912
01:38:20.853 --> 01:38:24.690
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

913
01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:28.736
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

914
01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.656
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

915
01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:34.700
The ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

916
01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:36.577
Mine! My own!

917
01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:39.580
Can't you hear yourself?

918
01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.374
Don't you know who you sound like?

919
01:38:51.634 --> 01:38:53.803
Gollum: We wants it.

920
01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:56.681
We needs it.

921
01:38:56.764 --> 01:39:01.686
Must have the precious.

922
01:39:01.769 --> 01:39:05.273
They stole it from us.

923
01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:08.818
Sneaky little hobbitses.

924
01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:12.864
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

925
01:39:12.947 --> 01:39:16.325
Smeagol: No. Not master.

926
01:39:16.409 --> 01:39:20.329
Gollum: Yes, precious. False.

927
01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:24.959
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

928
01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:28.588
Smeagol: Master's my friend.

929
01:39:28.671 --> 01:39:33.843
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

930
01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:37.597
Not listening. I'm not listening.

931
01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.726
You're a liar and a thief.

932
01:39:44.854 --> 01:39:47.732
Murderer.

933
01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:51.277
Go away.

934
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.779
Go away?

935
01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:58.618
I hate you.

936
01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:01.162
I hate you.

937
01:40:01.454 --> 01:40:04.790
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

938
01:40:04.874 --> 01:40:06.792
I saved us.

939
01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:11.464
It was me. We survived because of me.

940
01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:16.260
Not anymore.

941
01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:19.180
What did you say?

942
01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:25.102
Master looks after us now.

943
01:40:25.186 --> 01:40:28.731
We don't need you.

944
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.067
What?

945
01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:32.985
Leave now...

946
01:40:33.069 --> 01:40:36.948
And never come back.

947
01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:42.828
Leave now and never come back.

948
01:40:45.414 --> 01:40:51.337
Leave now and never come back!

949
01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:06.060
We told him to go away.

950
01:41:06.143 --> 01:41:09.188
And away he goes, precious.

951
01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:11.357
Gone! Gone! Gone!

952
01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.276
SmÃ©agol is free!

953
01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:19.740
Smeagol: Look.

954
01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:24.370
Look. See what smÃ©agol finds?

955
01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:35.339
They are young.

956
01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:38.050
They are tender. They are nice.

957
01:41:38.134 --> 01:41:41.721
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

958
01:41:44.473 --> 01:41:46.017
You'll make him sick, you will...

959
01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.478
Behaving like that.

960
01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:54.609
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

961
01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:00.364
What's it doing?

962
01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.784
Stupid, fat hobbit.

963
01:42:03.868 --> 01:42:06.162
It ruins it.

964
01:42:06.245 --> 01:42:09.915
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

965
01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:16.631
What we need is a few good taters.

966
01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:20.593
What's taters, precious?

967
01:42:20.676 --> 01:42:22.511
What's taters? Eh?

968
01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:24.347
Po-ta-toes.

969
01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.933
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

970
01:42:29.435 --> 01:42:34.940
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

971
01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:38.152
Even you couldn't say no to that.

972
01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:40.696
Oh, yes, we could.

973
01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:44.325
Spoil a nice fish.

974
01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:48.287
Give it to us raw...

975
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:51.499
And wriggling.

976
01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:54.752
You keep nasty chips.

977
01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:57.755
You're hopeless.

978
01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:11.769
Mr. Frodo?

979
01:43:29.662 --> 01:43:32.373
Sam: Who are they?
Smeagol: Wicked men.

980
01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.959
Servants of Sauron.

981
01:43:35.751 --> 01:43:38.003
They are called to mordor.

982
01:43:38.087 --> 01:43:41.215
The dark one is gathering all armies
to him.

983
01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:44.510
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

984
01:43:46.095 --> 01:43:49.765
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

985
01:43:49.849 --> 01:43:55.104
The last war that will cover
all the world in shadow.

986
01:43:55.354 --> 01:43:57.231
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

987
01:44:05.614 --> 01:44:07.908
It's an oliphaunt.

988
01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:19.128
No one at home will believe this.

989
01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:32.141
SmÃ©agol?

990
01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:14.975
We've lingered here too long.

991
01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:19.313
Come on, Sam.

992
01:45:32.743 --> 01:45:35.454
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

993
01:45:37.206 --> 01:45:42.336
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the dark tower.

994
01:45:42.419 --> 01:45:45.339
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

995
01:45:46.715 --> 01:45:50.135
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

996
01:45:50.219 --> 01:45:52.346
The enemy?

997
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:57.893
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

998
01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:02.481
You wonder what his name is...

999
01:46:03.983 --> 01:46:06.235
Where he came from.

1000
01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:10.656
And if he was really evil at heart.

1001
01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:15.786
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1002
01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:19.874
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1003
01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.586
In peace.

1004
01:46:27.131 --> 01:46:30.217
War will make corpses of us all.

1005
01:46:46.374 --> 01:46:49.210
Gimli: It's true, you don't see
many dwarf women.

1006
01:46:49.293 --> 01:46:53.005
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1007
01:46:53.089 --> 01:46:56.342
That they're often mistaken
for dwarf men.

1008
01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:58.594
It's the beards.

1009
01:46:58.845 --> 01:47:00.972
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief...

1010
01:47:01.055 --> 01:47:03.891
That there are no dwarf women...

1011
01:47:04.142 --> 01:47:08.396
And that dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground...

1012
01:47:10.064 --> 01:47:11.482
Which is, of course, ridiculous.

1013
01:47:18.030 --> 01:47:20.366
Gimli:
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1014
01:47:20.742 --> 01:47:22.744
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

1015
01:47:24.662 --> 01:47:28.499
I haven't seen my niece smile
for a long time.

1016
01:47:28.791 --> 01:47:31.586
She was a girl when they brought
her father back dead.

1017
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:34.046
Cut down by orcs.

1018
01:47:34.130 --> 01:47:37.175
She watched her mother
succumb to grief.

1019
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.555
Then she was left alone,
to tend her king in growing fear.

1020
01:47:42.638 --> 01:47:47.226
Doomed to wait upon an old man,
who should have loved her as a father.

1021
01:47:59.697 --> 01:48:01.866
No, I couldn't.

1022
01:48:01.949 --> 01:48:03.826
I really couldn't.

1023
01:48:08.331 --> 01:48:09.999
I made some stew.

1024
01:48:10.082 --> 01:48:13.419
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1025
01:48:21.219 --> 01:48:23.262
Thank you.

1026
01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:46.327
- It's good.
- Really?

1027
01:48:50.289 --> 01:48:53.668
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1028
01:48:54.961 --> 01:48:59.048
He said that you rode to war
with thengel, my grandfather.

1029
01:48:59.465 --> 01:49:02.051
But he must be mistaken.

1030
01:49:02.134 --> 01:49:06.597
King thÃ©oden has a good memory.
He was only a small child at the time.

1031
01:49:07.723 --> 01:49:10.977
Then you must be at least 60.

1032
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:14.605
Seventy?

1033
01:49:15.022 --> 01:49:16.691
But you cannot be 80!

1034
01:49:20.027 --> 01:49:21.404
Eighty-seven.

1035
01:49:24.490 --> 01:49:26.617
You are one of the dunedain.

1036
01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:30.788
A descendant of numenor,
blessed with long life.

1037
01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:34.625
It was said that your race
had passed into legend.

1038
01:49:35.293 --> 01:49:37.086
There are few of us left.

1039
01:49:37.169 --> 01:49:40.047
The northern kingdom
was destroyed long ago.

1040
01:49:40.798 --> 01:49:44.218
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1041
01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:03.029
Arwen: The light of the evenstar
does not wax and wane.

1042
01:50:03.779 --> 01:50:07.241
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1043
01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.454
Like my heart.

1044
01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:15.625
Go to sleep.

1045
01:50:15.708 --> 01:50:18.252
I am asleep.

1046
01:50:24.717 --> 01:50:26.677
This is a dream.

1047
01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:32.099
Then it is a good dream.

1048
01:50:44.111 --> 01:50:46.197
Sleep.

1049
01:51:49.176 --> 01:51:51.095
Annen...

1050
01:52:40.561 --> 01:52:42.396
Eowyn: Where is she?

1051
01:52:43.564 --> 01:52:45.983
The woman who gave you that Jewel.

1052
01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:52.073
Elrond: Our time here is ending.

1053
01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:55.326
Annen's time is ending.

1054
01:52:56.035 --> 01:52:57.369
Let her go.

1055
01:52:57.453 --> 01:52:59.538
Let her take the ship into the west.

1056
01:52:59.622 --> 01:53:02.792
Let her bear away her love for you
to the undying lands.

1057
01:53:02.875 --> 01:53:04.710
There it will be ever green.

1058
01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:08.589
But never more than memory.

1059
01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.968
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

1060
01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:16.764
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1061
01:53:16.847 --> 01:53:19.225
She belongs with her people.

1062
01:54:07.523 --> 01:54:09.358
Why are you saying this?

1063
01:54:10.943 --> 01:54:14.113
I am mortal. You are elf-kind.

1064
01:54:15.573 --> 01:54:18.242
It was a dream, annen.

1065
01:54:18.659 --> 01:54:20.035
Nothing more.

1066
01:54:21.412 --> 01:54:24.623
I don't believe you.

1067
01:54:33.632 --> 01:54:35.467
This belongs to you.

1068
01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:39.805
It was a gift.

1069
01:54:42.474 --> 01:54:43.976
Keep it.

1070
01:54:46.478 --> 01:54:47.688
Eowyn: My lord?

1071
01:54:50.482 --> 01:54:55.070
She is sailing to the undying lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1072
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:20.012
What is it?

1073
01:55:21.513 --> 01:55:23.557
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1074
01:55:40.115 --> 01:55:42.201
Wargs!

1075
01:55:54.713 --> 01:55:56.382
A scout!

1076
01:56:02.721 --> 01:56:05.224
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1077
01:56:06.558 --> 01:56:08.769
Get them out of here!

1078
01:56:13.524 --> 01:56:15.567
All riders to the head of the column.

1079
01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:18.279
Gimli:
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1080
01:56:18.362 --> 01:56:20.155
Come on!

1081
01:56:31.959 --> 01:56:34.461
You must lead the people
to helm's deep, and make haste.

1082
01:56:34.545 --> 01:56:36.088
- I can fight.
- No!

1083
01:56:38.757 --> 01:56:40.843
You must do this, for me.

1084
01:56:42.845 --> 01:56:44.430
Follow me! Hyah!

1085
01:56:47.933 --> 01:56:52.313
Gimli: Fonnard. I mean, charge fonnard.
Eowyn: Make for the lower ground!

1086
01:56:52.396 --> 01:56:55.107
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1087
01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:09.640
Gimli:
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1088
01:58:12.434 --> 01:58:14.019
That one counts as mine!

1089
01:58:30.702 --> 01:58:32.329
Stinking creature.

1090
01:59:59.583 --> 02:00:01.460
Aragorn!

1091
02:00:06.173 --> 02:00:07.633
Aragorn?

1092
02:00:21.647 --> 02:00:24.608
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

1093
02:00:28.987 --> 02:00:31.865
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1094
02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:36.787
You lie.

1095
02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:12.322
Get the wounded on horses.

1096
02:01:13.615 --> 02:01:16.785
The wolves of isengard will return.

1097
02:01:17.202 --> 02:01:19.329
Leave the dead.

1098
02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:28.213
Come.

1099
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:40.058
Woman 1: At last!
Woman 2: Helm's deep.

1100
02:01:40.142 --> 02:01:43.061
Woman 3:
There it is, helm's deep.

1101
02:01:45.606 --> 02:01:47.441
Woman 4: We're safe!

1102
02:01:48.942 --> 02:01:51.862
We're safe, my lady.

1103
02:01:51.945 --> 02:01:53.196
Thank you.

1104
02:02:37.532 --> 02:02:38.992
Freda: Mama! Morwen: Eothain!

1105
02:02:46.416 --> 02:02:49.252
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1106
02:02:53.090 --> 02:02:54.466
Take it to the caves.

1107
02:02:54.549 --> 02:02:57.427
Man: Make way for the king.

1108
02:02:59.304 --> 02:03:02.265
Gamling: Make way for thÃ©oden.
Make way for the king.

1109
02:03:10.148 --> 02:03:13.902
So few. So few of you have returned.

1110
02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:18.949
Our people are safe.

1111
02:03:20.283 --> 02:03:22.828
We have paid for it with many lives.

1112
02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.205
Gimli: My lady.

1113
02:03:28.917 --> 02:03:31.211
Lord aragorn...

1114
02:03:31.294 --> 02:03:32.587
Where is he?

1115
02:03:34.589 --> 02:03:36.133
He fell.

1116
02:03:58.822 --> 02:04:01.825
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1117
02:04:01.908 --> 02:04:04.870
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

1118
02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:08.248
Gamling: What of those who cannot
fight, my lord? The women and children?

1119
02:04:08.331 --> 02:04:11.001
Theoden:
Get them into the caves.

1120
02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:16.715
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1121
02:04:18.759 --> 02:04:22.220
Wormtongue:
Helm's deep has one weakness.

1122
02:04:22.304 --> 02:04:24.723
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1123
02:04:24.806 --> 02:04:27.976
But for a small culvert
at its base...

1124
02:04:28.059 --> 02:04:30.896
Which is little more than a drain.

1125
02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:37.944
How? How can fire undo stone?

1126
02:04:38.028 --> 02:04:42.616
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

1127
02:04:46.244 --> 02:04:50.290
Saruman: If the wall is breached,
helm's deep will fall.

1128
02:04:50.373 --> 02:04:53.960
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning...

1129
02:04:54.044 --> 02:04:56.713
Thousands, to storm the keep.

1130
02:04:56.797 --> 02:04:58.298
Saru man: Tens of thousands.

1131
02:04:58.381 --> 02:05:02.552
Wormtongue:
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1132
02:05:14.439 --> 02:05:17.567
A new power is rising.

1133
02:05:17.651 --> 02:05:20.695
Its victory is at hand.

1134
02:05:26.368 --> 02:05:28.453
This night...

1135
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:33.250
The land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

1136
02:05:33.333 --> 02:05:36.753
March to helm's deep!

1137
02:05:36.837 --> 02:05:40.382
Leave none alive!

1138
02:05:42.884 --> 02:05:45.387
To war!

1139
02:05:49.307 --> 02:05:53.770
There will be no dawn for men.

1140
02:06:10.954 --> 02:06:13.039
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1141
02:06:13.123 --> 02:06:16.418
There is always smoke rising...

1142
02:06:16.501 --> 02:06:20.380
From isengard these days.

1143
02:06:20.630 --> 02:06:22.299
Isengard?

1144
02:06:22.382 --> 02:06:24.301
Treebeard: There was a time...

1145
02:06:24.634 --> 02:06:28.221
When saruman would walk in my woods.

1146
02:06:28.305 --> 02:06:31.683
But now he has a mind of metal...

1147
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:34.811
And wheels.

1148
02:06:35.562 --> 02:06:40.108
He no longer cares for growing things.

1149
02:06:40.191 --> 02:06:42.027
What is it?

1150
02:06:47.032 --> 02:06:49.284
It's saruman's army.

1151
02:06:49.367 --> 02:06:50.994
The war has started.

1152
02:07:29.282 --> 02:07:33.662
Arwen: May the grace of the valar
protect you.

1153
02:08:05.944 --> 02:08:07.821
Brego.

1154
02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:35.098
Elrond: Annen.

1155
02:08:44.983 --> 02:08:46.776
I have made my choice.

1156
02:08:53.199 --> 02:08:56.077
He is not coming back.

1157
02:08:57.495 --> 02:09:00.832
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

1158
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:04.753
There is still hope.

1159
02:09:08.882 --> 02:09:12.677
If aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

1160
02:09:16.056 --> 02:09:19.059
If Sauron is defeated
and aragorn made king...

1161
02:09:19.142 --> 02:09:21.728
And all that you hope for
comes true...

1162
02:09:21.811 --> 02:09:26.566
You will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1163
02:09:26.858 --> 02:09:29.903
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time...

1164
02:09:29.986 --> 02:09:32.947
Aragorn will die.

1165
02:09:35.784 --> 02:09:38.411
And there will be no comfort
for you...

1166
02:09:38.495 --> 02:09:42.749
No comfort to ease the pain
of his passing.

1167
02:09:45.543 --> 02:09:48.338
He will come to death...

1168
02:09:48.421 --> 02:09:51.091
An image of the splendor
of the kings of men...

1169
02:09:51.174 --> 02:09:55.887
In glory undimmed before
the breaking of the world.

1170
02:10:04.979 --> 02:10:08.942
But you, my daughter...

1171
02:10:09.734 --> 02:10:14.823
You will linger on in darkness
and in doubt...

1172
02:10:14.906 --> 02:10:19.035
As nightfall in winter
that comes without a star.

1173
02:10:21.412 --> 02:10:23.873
Here you will dwell...

1174
02:10:23.957 --> 02:10:28.920
Bound to your grief
under the fading trees...

1175
02:10:30.630 --> 02:10:32.674
Until all the world is changed...

1176
02:10:32.757 --> 02:10:37.303
And the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

1177
02:10:45.854 --> 02:10:47.021
Annen.

1178
02:10:53.653 --> 02:10:55.947
There is nothing for you here...

1179
02:10:56.614 --> 02:10:58.700
Only death.

1180
02:12:32.126 --> 02:12:35.797
Galadriel:
The power of the enemy is growing.

1181
02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:38.591
Sauron will use his puppet,
saruman...

1182
02:12:38.675 --> 02:12:42.178
To destroy the people of Rohan.

1183
02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:47.892
Isengard has been unleashed.

1184
02:12:52.188 --> 02:12:55.566
The eye of Sauron now turns
to gondor...

1185
02:12:56.693 --> 02:12:59.737
The last free kingdom of men.

1186
02:12:59.821 --> 02:13:04.242
His war on this country
will come swiftly.

1187
02:13:07.954 --> 02:13:11.124
He senses the ring is close.

1188
02:13:11.207 --> 02:13:14.752
The strength of the ring-bearer
is failing.

1189
02:13:14.836 --> 02:13:18.923
In his heart, Frodo begins
to understand...

1190
02:13:20.466 --> 02:13:24.387
The quest will claim his life.

1191
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:26.681
You know this.

1192
02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:30.101
You have foreseen it.

1193
02:13:32.228 --> 02:13:35.690
It is the risk we all took.

1194
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:44.282
In the gathering dark, the will
of the ring grows strong.

1195
02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:49.912
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of men.

1196
02:13:49.996 --> 02:13:55.585
Men, who are so easily seduced
by its power.

1197
02:13:55.668 --> 02:13:59.339
The young captain of gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1198
02:13:59.422 --> 02:14:03.551
Take the ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

1199
02:14:05.970 --> 02:14:07.847
It is close now.

1200
02:14:07.930 --> 02:14:12.226
So close to achieving its goal.

1201
02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:19.025
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this earth...

1202
02:14:19.108 --> 02:14:23.279
Even unto the ending
of the world.

1203
02:14:25.114 --> 02:14:27.033
The time of the elves...

1204
02:14:27.116 --> 02:14:29.077
Is over.

1205
02:14:29.911 --> 02:14:33.498
Do we leave middle-earth
to its fate?

1206
02:14:35.458 --> 02:14:38.711
Do we let them stand alone?

1207
02:14:43.341 --> 02:14:44.717
What news?

1208
02:14:44.801 --> 02:14:47.720
Our scouts report saruman
has attacked Rohan.

1209
02:14:47.804 --> 02:14:50.723
ThÃ©oden's people have fled
to helm's deep.

1210
02:14:50.807 --> 02:14:54.936
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, orcs are on the move.

1211
02:14:55.019 --> 02:14:57.480
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1212
02:14:57.814 --> 02:14:59.982
Easterlings and southrons
are at the black gate.

1213
02:15:00.066 --> 02:15:03.528
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1214
02:15:04.612 --> 02:15:08.241
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at osgiliath.

1215
02:15:08.324 --> 02:15:11.411
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

1216
02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.748
Faramir:
Saruman attacks from isengard.

1217
02:15:15.832 --> 02:15:18.584
Sauron from mordor.

1218
02:15:19.877 --> 02:15:23.172
The fight will come to men
on both fronts.

1219
02:15:23.256 --> 02:15:25.049
Gondor is weak.

1220
02:15:25.133 --> 02:15:28.302
Sauron will strike us soon.

1221
02:15:31.347 --> 02:15:35.435
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

1222
02:15:49.365 --> 02:15:51.617
My men tell me that you are orc spies.

1223
02:15:51.701 --> 02:15:54.537
Spies? Now waitjust a minute.

1224
02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:56.914
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

1225
02:16:03.796 --> 02:16:05.548
Speak.

1226
02:16:06.632 --> 02:16:09.260
We are hobbits of the shire.

1227
02:16:09.594 --> 02:16:12.597
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is samwise gamgee.

1228
02:16:13.014 --> 02:16:14.599
Your bodyguard?

1229
02:16:14.682 --> 02:16:16.517
His gardener.

1230
02:16:17.101 --> 02:16:19.103
And where is your skulking friend?

1231
02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:22.940
That gangrel creature.

1232
02:16:23.274 --> 02:16:25.234
He had an ill-favored look.

1233
02:16:26.944 --> 02:16:28.863
There was no other.

1234
02:16:32.950 --> 02:16:35.286
We set out from rivendell
with seven companions.

1235
02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:41.709
One we lost in Moria...

1236
02:16:42.793 --> 02:16:44.337
Two were my kin...

1237
02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:48.257
A dwarf there was also.
And an elf and two men.

1238
02:16:48.341 --> 02:16:52.303
Aragorn, son of arathorn,
and Boromir of gondor.

1239
02:16:57.308 --> 02:16:59.060
You're a friend of Boromir?

1240
02:17:04.065 --> 02:17:05.149
For my part.

1241
02:17:11.656 --> 02:17:14.617
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

1242
02:17:16.661 --> 02:17:18.162
Dead?

1243
02:17:20.581 --> 02:17:23.251
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

1244
02:17:23.543 --> 02:17:27.380
If something has happened to Boromir,
we would have you tell us.

1245
02:17:30.132 --> 02:17:36.681
His horn washed up upon the riverbank,
about six days past.

1246
02:17:36.764 --> 02:17:39.892
It was cloven in two.

1247
02:17:41.561 --> 02:17:44.981
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1248
02:17:47.024 --> 02:17:48.818
He was my brother.

1249
02:18:37.658 --> 02:18:40.745
Men: Boromir!

1250
02:18:41.245 --> 02:18:43.122
Boromir!

1251
02:18:47.376 --> 02:18:51.172
This city was once the Jewel
of our kingdom.

1252
02:18:51.255 --> 02:18:55.009
A place of light and beauty and music.

1253
02:18:55.092 --> 02:18:57.470
And so it shall be once more!

1254
02:19:00.014 --> 02:19:02.725
Let the armies of mordor know this:

1255
02:19:02.808 --> 02:19:07.229
Never again will the land of my people
fall into enemy hands.

1256
02:19:11.025 --> 02:19:16.697
This city of osgiliath
has been reclaimed for gondor!

1257
02:19:17.073 --> 02:19:19.075
- For gondor!
- For gondor!

1258
02:19:19.158 --> 02:19:22.036
- For gondor!
- For gondor!

1259
02:19:30.753 --> 02:19:33.547
Good speech. Nice and short.

1260
02:19:33.631 --> 02:19:36.592
Leaves more time for drinking!

1261
02:19:36.884 --> 02:19:41.138
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1262
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:46.811
Remember today, little brother.

1263
02:19:46.894 --> 02:19:49.939
Today, life is good.

1264
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:55.695
What?

1265
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:57.530
He's here.

1266
02:20:00.741 --> 02:20:03.828
- Moment of peace, can he not give us that?
- Denethor: Where is he?

1267
02:20:03.911 --> 02:20:07.415
Where is gondor's finest?
Where's my first-born?

1268
02:20:14.505 --> 02:20:16.924
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.

1269
02:20:17.007 --> 02:20:20.469
They exaggerate.
The victory belongs to faramir also.

1270
02:20:21.929 --> 02:20:24.849
But for faramir, this city
would still be standing.

1271
02:20:25.641 --> 02:20:27.977
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1272
02:20:28.060 --> 02:20:30.187
I would have done,
but our numbers were too few.

1273
02:20:30.271 --> 02:20:32.022
Oh, too few.

1274
02:20:32.523 --> 02:20:34.900
You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.

1275
02:20:37.111 --> 02:20:40.239
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1276
02:20:40.322 --> 02:20:42.658
That is not my intent.

1277
02:20:42.742 --> 02:20:46.537
You give him no credit,
and yet he tries to do your will.

1278
02:20:49.915 --> 02:20:52.877
- He loves you, father.
- Do not trouble me with faramir...

1279
02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:55.796
I know his uses, and they are few.

1280
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:59.550
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1281
02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:03.179
Elrond of rivendell has called a meeting.

1282
02:21:03.262 --> 02:21:06.223
He will not say why,
but I have guessed its purpose.

1283
02:21:06.307 --> 02:21:10.144
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1284
02:21:12.354 --> 02:21:14.648
The one ring.

1285
02:21:17.401 --> 02:21:22.114
- Isildur's bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the elves.

1286
02:21:22.198 --> 02:21:25.910
Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, dwarves, wizards.

1287
02:21:25.993 --> 02:21:30.164
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to gondor.

1288
02:21:31.957 --> 02:21:34.668
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1289
02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:38.547
Ever the ring will seek to corrupt
the hearts of lesser men.

1290
02:21:38.631 --> 02:21:42.676
But you, you are strong.
And our need is great.

1291
02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:48.140
It is our blood which is being spilled,
our people who are dying.

1292
02:21:48.224 --> 02:21:53.395
Sauron is biding his time.
He's massing fresh armies.

1293
02:21:53.479 --> 02:21:55.064
He will return.

1294
02:21:55.147 --> 02:21:58.984
And when he does,
we will be powerless to stop him.

1295
02:21:59.068 --> 02:22:01.654
You must go.

1296
02:22:02.822 --> 02:22:04.949
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1297
02:22:05.783 --> 02:22:11.205
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in rivendell.

1298
02:22:11.455 --> 02:22:15.167
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to rivendell...

1299
02:22:15.251 --> 02:22:18.295
- Send me in his stead.
- You?

1300
02:22:19.463 --> 02:22:21.423
Oh, I see.

1301
02:22:21.507 --> 02:22:25.761
A chance for faramir, captain of gondor,
to show his quality.

1302
02:22:26.178 --> 02:22:28.222
I think not.

1303
02:22:28.305 --> 02:22:31.267
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1304
02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:34.311
The one who will not fail me.

1305
02:22:51.453 --> 02:22:54.623
Remember today, little brother.

1306
02:23:12.975 --> 02:23:14.977
Man: Captain faramir!

1307
02:23:16.228 --> 02:23:18.355
We found the third one.

1308
02:23:29.867 --> 02:23:31.869
You must come with me. Now.

1309
02:23:43.088 --> 02:23:44.214
Down there.

1310
02:23:59.104 --> 02:24:01.982
To enter the forbidden pool
bears the penalty of death.

1311
02:24:12.576 --> 02:24:14.078
They wait for my command.

1312
02:24:19.583 --> 02:24:20.668
Shall I shoot?

1313
02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:24.964
The rock and pool
is nice and cool

1314
02:24:25.047 --> 02:24:26.924
so juicy sweet

1315
02:24:27.591 --> 02:24:30.594
our only wish to catch a fish

1316
02:24:30.678 --> 02:24:33.430
so juicy sweet

1317
02:24:40.437 --> 02:24:41.814
Wait.

1318
02:24:43.315 --> 02:24:46.151
This creature is bound to me.

1319
02:24:46.777 --> 02:24:48.696
And I to him.

1320
02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:53.283
He is our guide.

1321
02:24:57.997 --> 02:24:59.456
Please...

1322
02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:01.458
Let me go down to him.

1323
02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:14.388
SmÃ©agol.

1324
02:25:15.389 --> 02:25:17.641
Master is here.

1325
02:25:18.809 --> 02:25:19.977
Come, smÃ©agol.

1326
02:25:22.813 --> 02:25:25.482
Trust master. Come.

1327
02:25:28.652 --> 02:25:32.489
We must go now?

1328
02:25:32.823 --> 02:25:36.326
SmÃ©agol, you must trust master.

1329
02:25:36.410 --> 02:25:37.828
Follow me. Come on.

1330
02:25:39.038 --> 02:25:40.664
Come.

1331
02:25:43.167 --> 02:25:44.334
Come, smÃ©agol.

1332
02:25:44.835 --> 02:25:46.920
Nice smÃ©agol. That's it.

1333
02:25:47.421 --> 02:25:48.964
Come on.

1334
02:25:53.343 --> 02:25:55.054
Don't hurt him!

1335
02:25:55.137 --> 02:25:57.973
SmÃ©agol, don't struggle.
SmÃ©agol, listen to me.

1336
02:25:58.057 --> 02:25:59.391
Master!

1337
02:26:24.583 --> 02:26:26.919
That's enough.

1338
02:26:30.589 --> 02:26:32.800
Where are you leading them?

1339
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:36.220
Faramir: Answer me.

1340
02:26:37.054 --> 02:26:40.265
Gollum: SmÃ©agol.

1341
02:26:43.727 --> 02:26:48.482
Gollum:
Why does it cry, smÃ©agol?

1342
02:26:49.733 --> 02:26:52.402
Smeagol: Cruel men hurts us.

1343
02:26:52.486 --> 02:26:55.572
Master tricksed us.

1344
02:26:55.656 --> 02:26:59.243
Gollum: Of course he did.

1345
02:26:59.618 --> 02:27:03.372
I told you he was tricksy.

1346
02:27:03.455 --> 02:27:06.583
I told you he was false.

1347
02:27:06.667 --> 02:27:09.461
Smeagol: Master is our friend.

1348
02:27:12.047 --> 02:27:14.299
Gollum: Master betrayed us.

1349
02:27:14.383 --> 02:27:17.427
Smeagol: No. Not its business.

1350
02:27:18.512 --> 02:27:20.973
Leave us alone!

1351
02:27:21.056 --> 02:27:23.559
Gollum: Filthy little hobbitses!

1352
02:27:23.642 --> 02:27:26.019
They stole it from us!

1353
02:27:26.103 --> 02:27:27.604
Smeagol: No. No.

1354
02:27:28.147 --> 02:27:29.773
What did they steal?

1355
02:27:31.942 --> 02:27:37.281
Gollum: My precious!

1356
02:27:40.951 --> 02:27:42.619
We have to get out of here.

1357
02:27:43.203 --> 02:27:45.164
You go. Go, now.

1358
02:27:47.791 --> 02:27:49.626
You can do it.

1359
02:27:51.086 --> 02:27:52.588
Use the ring, Mr. Frodo.

1360
02:27:52.671 --> 02:27:54.548
Just this once.

1361
02:27:54.631 --> 02:27:56.466
Put it on.

1362
02:27:56.884 --> 02:27:58.927
Disappear.

1363
02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:01.054
I can't.

1364
02:28:04.141 --> 02:28:06.351
You were right, Sam.

1365
02:28:07.811 --> 02:28:10.314
You tried to tell me but...

1366
02:28:14.985 --> 02:28:17.154
I'm sorry.

1367
02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:24.578
The rings taking me, Sam.

1368
02:28:25.996 --> 02:28:27.706
If I put it on...

1369
02:28:27.789 --> 02:28:30.167
He'll find me.

1370
02:28:31.835 --> 02:28:33.795
He'll see.

1371
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:46.183
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1372
02:28:48.393 --> 02:28:51.438
Here in the wild I have you...

1373
02:28:51.521 --> 02:28:53.523
Two halflings...

1374
02:28:53.607 --> 02:28:56.818
And a host of men at my call.

1375
02:29:00.113 --> 02:29:03.617
The ring of power within my grasp.

1376
02:29:13.293 --> 02:29:17.047
A chance for faramir,
captain of gondor...

1377
02:29:18.632 --> 02:29:21.677
To show his quality.

1378
02:29:47.577 --> 02:29:48.954
Stop it!

1379
02:29:49.037 --> 02:29:50.122
Leave him alone.

1380
02:29:51.456 --> 02:29:53.959
Don't you understand?

1381
02:29:55.252 --> 02:29:57.212
He's got to destroy it!

1382
02:29:57.296 --> 02:30:00.632
That's where we're going, into mordor.

1383
02:30:00.716 --> 02:30:02.426
To the mountain of fire!

1384
02:30:03.468 --> 02:30:06.638
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1385
02:30:06.722 --> 02:30:09.766
Sam: Please. It's such a burden.

1386
02:30:11.935 --> 02:30:14.021
Will you not help him?

1387
02:30:15.355 --> 02:30:17.274
Captain?

1388
02:30:17.941 --> 02:30:20.152
Prepare to leave.

1389
02:30:25.115 --> 02:30:27.534
The ring will go to gondor.

1390
02:31:40.524 --> 02:31:43.235
Woman: He's alive!
Gimli: Where is he? Where is he?

1391
02:31:43.318 --> 02:31:46.446
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1392
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:50.409
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1393
02:31:50.492 --> 02:31:54.538
And the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1394
02:31:55.205 --> 02:31:56.706
Bless you, laddie.

1395
02:31:57.290 --> 02:31:59.042
Gimli, where is the king?

1396
02:32:12.806 --> 02:32:14.141
You look terrible.

1397
02:32:55.891 --> 02:32:57.976
A great host, you say?

1398
02:32:58.059 --> 02:32:59.603
All isengard is emptied.

1399
02:32:59.686 --> 02:33:00.770
How many?

1400
02:33:01.438 --> 02:33:04.441
Aragorn:
Ten thousand strong at least.

1401
02:33:05.984 --> 02:33:07.444
Ten thousand?

1402
02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:10.363
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1403
02:33:13.033 --> 02:33:15.160
To destroy the world of men.

1404
02:33:17.662 --> 02:33:19.664
They will be here by nightfall.

1405
02:33:25.504 --> 02:33:26.796
Let them come!

1406
02:33:28.298 --> 02:33:31.134
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms...

1407
02:33:31.218 --> 02:33:34.387
To be ready for battle by nightfall.

1408
02:33:42.646 --> 02:33:45.607
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1409
02:33:45.690 --> 02:33:48.193
No army has ever breached
the deeping wall...

1410
02:33:48.276 --> 02:33:51.112
Or set foot inside the hornburg!

1411
02:33:51.196 --> 02:33:53.657
This is no rabble of mindless orcs.

1412
02:33:54.241 --> 02:33:56.493
These are uruk-hai.

1413
02:33:56.576 --> 02:34:00.038
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1414
02:34:01.665 --> 02:34:05.377
I have fought many wars,
master dwarf.

1415
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:09.130
I know how to defend my own keep.

1416
02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:19.182
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1417
02:34:19.266 --> 02:34:24.604
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1418
02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:27.440
Crops can be resown...

1419
02:34:27.524 --> 02:34:30.569
Homes rebuilt.

1420
02:34:31.194 --> 02:34:33.738
Within these walls...

1421
02:34:34.114 --> 02:34:35.657
We will outlast them.

1422
02:34:35.740 --> 02:34:38.243
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1423
02:34:38.326 --> 02:34:39.953
They come to destroy its people...

1424
02:34:40.036 --> 02:34:42.581
Down to the last child.

1425
02:34:43.456 --> 02:34:45.750
What would you have me do?

1426
02:34:45.834 --> 02:34:47.669
Look at my men.

1427
02:34:47.752 --> 02:34:49.546
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1428
02:34:51.715 --> 02:34:56.177
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end...

1429
02:34:56.261 --> 02:34:59.347
As to be worthy of remembrance.

1430
02:35:02.976 --> 02:35:04.894
Aragorn:
Send out riders, my lord.

1431
02:35:05.186 --> 02:35:08.064
You must call for aid.

1432
02:35:11.318 --> 02:35:13.570
And who will come?

1433
02:35:13.987 --> 02:35:15.614
Elves?

1434
02:35:15.697 --> 02:35:17.824
Dwarves?

1435
02:35:18.575 --> 02:35:21.453
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1436
02:35:22.287 --> 02:35:24.581
The old alliances are dead.

1437
02:35:24.998 --> 02:35:27.834
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1438
02:35:27.917 --> 02:35:30.170
Where was gondor
when the westfold fell?!

1439
02:35:31.129 --> 02:35:34.424
Where was gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1440
02:35:34.507 --> 02:35:36.468
Where was gon...?

1441
02:35:39.137 --> 02:35:41.097
No, my lord aragorn...

1442
02:35:42.682 --> 02:35:45.143
We are alone.

1443
02:35:52.025 --> 02:35:53.818
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1444
02:35:53.902 --> 02:35:55.296
Man 1: We need more time
to lay provisions...

1445
02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:58.865
Theoden:
There is no time. War is upon us.

1446
02:35:59.115 --> 02:36:00.825
Man 2: Secure the gate.

1447
02:36:06.039 --> 02:36:08.208
We ents have not troubled...

1448
02:36:08.291 --> 02:36:11.711
About the wars of men and wizards...

1449
02:36:12.462 --> 02:36:15.465
For a very long time.

1450
02:36:16.716 --> 02:36:21.513
But now, something
is about to happen...

1451
02:36:21.596 --> 02:36:24.057
That has not happened...

1452
02:36:24.140 --> 02:36:26.643
For an age.

1453
02:36:27.852 --> 02:36:30.146
Entmoot.

1454
02:36:30.522 --> 02:36:31.564
What's that?

1455
02:36:31.981 --> 02:36:34.818
'Tis a gathering.

1456
02:36:35.985 --> 02:36:38.571
A gathering of what?

1457
02:36:56.506 --> 02:36:58.883
Treebeard: Beech. Oak.

1458
02:36:58.967 --> 02:37:00.927
Chestnut. Ash.

1459
02:37:01.177 --> 02:37:03.221
Good. Good. Good.

1460
02:37:03.304 --> 02:37:05.682
Many have come.

1461
02:37:13.231 --> 02:37:16.067
Now we must decide
if the ents...

1462
02:37:16.151 --> 02:37:18.737
Will go to war.

1463
02:37:27.704 --> 02:37:30.749
Guard 1:
Move back! Move to the caves!

1464
02:37:33.209 --> 02:37:35.295
Guard 2:
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1465
02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:38.047
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1466
02:37:38.131 --> 02:37:40.508
They can support the archers
from above the gate.

1467
02:37:40.592 --> 02:37:43.803
Aragorn, you must rest.

1468
02:37:43.887 --> 02:37:45.472
You're no use to us half alive.

1469
02:37:46.765 --> 02:37:48.016
Eowyn: Aragorn!

1470
02:37:51.394 --> 02:37:54.481
I'm to be sent with the women
into the caves.

1471
02:37:54.564 --> 02:37:56.316
That is an honorable charge.

1472
02:37:56.399 --> 02:37:59.360
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1473
02:37:59.444 --> 02:38:01.237
What renown is there in that?

1474
02:38:01.321 --> 02:38:05.074
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown.

1475
02:38:05.325 --> 02:38:08.161
Who then will your people look to
in the last defense?

1476
02:38:08.244 --> 02:38:13.291
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1477
02:38:13.583 --> 02:38:16.461
You do not command
the others to stay!

1478
02:38:16.544 --> 02:38:20.340
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.

1479
02:38:21.508 --> 02:38:23.718
Because they love you.

1480
02:38:30.809 --> 02:38:32.352
I'm sorry.

1481
02:39:38.251 --> 02:39:41.546
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1482
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:44.424
These are no soldiers.

1483
02:39:46.676 --> 02:39:50.179
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1484
02:39:54.100 --> 02:39:57.061
Look at them. They're frightened.

1485
02:39:57.145 --> 02:39:58.646
I can see it in their eyes.

1486
02:40:13.077 --> 02:40:14.370
Aragorn.

1487
02:40:19.584 --> 02:40:21.794
Then I shall die as one of them!

1488
02:40:28.217 --> 02:40:30.053
Gimli: Let him go, lad.

1489
02:40:34.057 --> 02:40:39.562
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1490
02:40:43.816 --> 02:40:45.735
My lord?

1491
02:40:47.779 --> 02:40:50.365
Who am I, gamling?

1492
02:40:53.743 --> 02:40:57.622
You are our king, sire.

1493
02:41:00.625 --> 02:41:03.878
And do you trust your king?

1494
02:41:05.421 --> 02:41:08.633
Your men, my lord...

1495
02:41:08.716 --> 02:41:11.552
Will follow you to whatever end.

1496
02:41:18.434 --> 02:41:20.353
To whatever end.

1497
02:41:30.196 --> 02:41:33.825
Where is the horse and the rider?

1498
02:41:33.908 --> 02:41:36.995
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1499
02:41:38.496 --> 02:41:42.959
They have passed like rain
on the mountains.

1500
02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:47.171
Like wind in the Meadow.

1501
02:41:50.842 --> 02:41:54.595
The days have gone down in the west...

1502
02:41:59.851 --> 02:42:01.477
Into shadow.

1503
02:42:09.944 --> 02:42:13.364
How did it come to this?

1504
02:42:29.672 --> 02:42:31.299
Huh?

1505
02:42:34.677 --> 02:42:36.512
It's been going for hours.

1506
02:42:37.680 --> 02:42:40.141
They must have decided something
by now.

1507
02:42:40.224 --> 02:42:44.395
Treebeard: Decided? No.

1508
02:42:44.479 --> 02:42:49.692
We only just finished saying...

1509
02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:52.737
Good morning.

1510
02:42:54.072 --> 02:42:57.325
But it's nighttime already.

1511
02:42:57.408 --> 02:42:59.243
You can't take forever.

1512
02:43:00.244 --> 02:43:02.330
Don't be hasty.

1513
02:43:02.747 --> 02:43:05.166
We're running out of time!

1514
02:43:08.294 --> 02:43:11.130
Guard:
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1515
02:43:28.689 --> 02:43:29.982
Give me your sword.

1516
02:43:39.492 --> 02:43:40.660
What is your name?

1517
02:43:41.244 --> 02:43:43.579
Haleth, son of hama, my lord.

1518
02:43:45.748 --> 02:43:48.334
The men are saying that
we will not live out the night.

1519
02:43:50.336 --> 02:43:52.296
They say that it is hopeless.

1520
02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:11.732
This is a good sword.

1521
02:44:13.776 --> 02:44:16.112
Haleth, son of hama...

1522
02:44:20.449 --> 02:44:22.618
There is always hope.

1523
02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:49.020
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1524
02:44:49.103 --> 02:44:50.730
Forgive me.

1525
02:44:50.813 --> 02:44:52.273
I was wrong to despair.

1526
02:45:01.157 --> 02:45:04.285
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1527
02:45:07.747 --> 02:45:09.790
It's a little tight across the chest.

1528
02:45:16.005 --> 02:45:17.924
That is no orc horn.

1529
02:45:23.638 --> 02:45:25.514
Send for the king.

1530
02:45:25.598 --> 02:45:29.227
- Open the gate!
- Guard: Open up the gate!

1531
02:46:00.883 --> 02:46:02.551
How is this possible?

1532
02:46:03.552 --> 02:46:07.265
I bring word from elrond of rivendell.

1533
02:46:07.348 --> 02:46:10.601
An alliance once existed
between elves and men.

1534
02:46:11.310 --> 02:46:15.523
Long ago we fought and died together.

1535
02:46:17.817 --> 02:46:20.695
We come to honor that allegiance.

1536
02:46:29.203 --> 02:46:31.122
You are most welcome.

1537
02:46:36.502 --> 02:46:40.298
We are proud to fight
alongside men once more.

1538
02:47:14.081 --> 02:47:17.335
Gimli:
You could have picked a better spot.

1539
02:47:22.173 --> 02:47:26.385
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1540
02:47:32.516 --> 02:47:34.310
Your friends are with you, aragorn.

1541
02:47:34.935 --> 02:47:37.438
Let's hope they last the night.

1542
02:49:18.873 --> 02:49:21.709
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1543
02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:24.753
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1544
02:50:27.942 --> 02:50:29.777
So it begins.

1545
02:50:56.637 --> 02:50:57.972
Did they hit anything?

1546
02:50:58.639 --> 02:51:00.683
Give them a volley.

1547
02:51:00.766 --> 02:51:02.935
- Fire!
- Fire!

1548
02:51:18.659 --> 02:51:20.327
Send them to me! Come on!

1549
02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:42.182
Good!

1550
02:51:48.981 --> 02:51:51.984
Swords! Swords!

1551
02:52:30.064 --> 02:52:32.232
Legolas! Two already!

1552
02:52:32.316 --> 02:52:34.526
I'm on 17!

1553
02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:37.237
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1554
02:52:44.036 --> 02:52:45.746
Nineteen!

1555
02:53:11.730 --> 02:53:13.148
Merry.

1556
02:53:17.569 --> 02:53:21.365
We have just agreed.

1557
02:53:31.375 --> 02:53:32.835
Yes?

1558
02:53:34.336 --> 02:53:38.507
I have told your names to the entmoot...

1559
02:53:39.633 --> 02:53:42.886
And we have agreed...

1560
02:53:43.345 --> 02:53:47.391
You are not orcs.

1561
02:53:49.143 --> 02:53:51.311
Well, that's good news.

1562
02:53:51.395 --> 02:53:55.566
And what about saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1563
02:53:56.191 --> 02:54:00.028
Now, don't be hasty, master meriadoc.

1564
02:54:00.112 --> 02:54:01.697
Hasty?

1565
02:54:02.489 --> 02:54:04.408
Our friends are out there.

1566
02:54:04.491 --> 02:54:08.704
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1567
02:54:09.037 --> 02:54:11.373
War? Yes.

1568
02:54:11.457 --> 02:54:13.417
It affects us all.

1569
02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:16.545
Tree, root and twig.

1570
02:54:17.421 --> 02:54:21.550
But you must understand, young hobbit...

1571
02:54:21.633 --> 02:54:23.635
It takes a long time...

1572
02:54:23.719 --> 02:54:28.724
To say anything in old entish...

1573
02:54:28.807 --> 02:54:33.103
And we never say anything...

1574
02:54:33.187 --> 02:54:37.191
Unless it is worth taking...

1575
02:54:37.274 --> 02:54:41.361
A long time to say.

1576
02:54:42.154 --> 02:54:45.491
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1577
02:54:45.574 --> 02:54:46.700
Nineteen!

1578
02:54:47.242 --> 02:54:49.161
Twenty!

1579
02:54:49.244 --> 02:54:50.954
Twenty-one!

1580
02:55:01.048 --> 02:55:02.132
Causeway!

1581
02:55:10.808 --> 02:55:13.227
Is this it?

1582
02:55:13.310 --> 02:55:16.271
Is this all you can conjure, saruman?

1583
02:56:42.274 --> 02:56:43.650
Brace the gate!

1584
02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:04.212
Hold them! Stand firm!

1585
02:57:12.095 --> 02:57:13.430
Aragorn!

1586
02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:19.269
Gimli!

1587
02:58:08.026 --> 02:58:11.947
The ents cannot hold back this storm.

1588
02:58:12.739 --> 02:58:16.743
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1589
02:58:17.577 --> 02:58:19.663
How can that be your decision?!

1590
02:58:20.330 --> 02:58:23.959
This is not our war.

1591
02:58:24.251 --> 02:58:26.461
But you're part of this world!

1592
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:32.426
Aren't you?!

1593
02:58:36.513 --> 02:58:38.890
You must help. Please.

1594
02:58:40.183 --> 02:58:42.936
You must do something.

1595
02:58:43.228 --> 02:58:47.524
You are young and brave, master merry.

1596
02:58:48.734 --> 02:58:52.487
But your part in this tale is over.

1597
02:58:52.571 --> 02:58:54.865
Go back to your home.

1598
02:59:04.875 --> 02:59:07.169
Maybe treebeard's right.

1599
02:59:07.252 --> 02:59:09.212
We don't belong here, merry.

1600
02:59:09.296 --> 02:59:11.673
It's too big for us.

1601
02:59:11.757 --> 02:59:14.468
What can we do in the end?

1602
02:59:16.762 --> 02:59:19.389
We've got the shire.

1603
02:59:19.931 --> 02:59:22.476
Maybe we should go home.

1604
02:59:24.311 --> 02:59:27.564
The fires of isengard will spread...

1605
02:59:27.647 --> 02:59:32.652
And the woods of tuckborough
and buckland will burn.

1606
02:59:32.736 --> 02:59:34.362
And...

1607
02:59:36.156 --> 02:59:39.242
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1608
02:59:42.788 --> 02:59:45.707
There won't be a shire, pippin.

1609
03:00:05.227 --> 03:00:06.520
Gamling: Aragorn!

1610
03:00:06.603 --> 03:00:09.064
Fall back to the keep!

1611
03:00:09.147 --> 03:00:12.275
Get your men out of there!

1612
03:00:27.707 --> 03:00:30.961
Gimli: What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1613
03:01:34.107 --> 03:01:35.609
Man: Brace the gate!

1614
03:01:40.947 --> 03:01:44.326
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1615
03:02:12.479 --> 03:02:14.397
Make way!

1616
03:02:17.317 --> 03:02:19.027
We cannot hold much longer!

1617
03:02:24.991 --> 03:02:28.620
- Theoden: Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1618
03:02:28.703 --> 03:02:31.373
As long as you can give me.

1619
03:02:31.456 --> 03:02:33.166
Gimli!

1620
03:02:34.626 --> 03:02:36.044
Timbers!

1621
03:02:36.127 --> 03:02:38.129
Man: Brace the gate!

1622
03:02:52.894 --> 03:02:54.604
Come on. We can take them.

1623
03:02:55.438 --> 03:02:57.065
It's a long way.

1624
03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:04.072
Toss me.

1625
03:03:05.240 --> 03:03:07.117
- What?
- I cannotjump the distance!

1626
03:03:07.200 --> 03:03:08.827
You'll have to toss me!

1627
03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:15.709
Don't tell the elf.

1628
03:03:16.209 --> 03:03:18.003
Not a word.

1629
03:03:33.226 --> 03:03:34.728
Shore up the door!

1630
03:03:34.811 --> 03:03:36.980
Man 1: Make way!
Man 2: Follow me to the barricade.

1631
03:03:37.063 --> 03:03:38.189
Man 1: Watch our backs!

1632
03:03:42.319 --> 03:03:44.571
- Man 3: Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1633
03:04:34.496 --> 03:04:35.914
Man 4: Hold fast the gate!

1634
03:04:40.126 --> 03:04:43.088
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1635
03:04:47.801 --> 03:04:49.427
Aragorn!

1636
03:05:22.836 --> 03:05:25.296
Pull everybody back.

1637
03:05:33.304 --> 03:05:34.931
Theoden:
They have broken through!

1638
03:05:35.014 --> 03:05:37.475
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1639
03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:39.894
Gamling: Fall back!
Theoden: Retreat!

1640
03:05:39.978 --> 03:05:42.647
Aragorn:
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1641
03:05:42.730 --> 03:05:45.024
Theoden: Into the keep!

1642
03:05:56.494 --> 03:06:01.499
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1643
03:06:01.583 --> 03:06:06.337
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1644
03:06:12.051 --> 03:06:13.344
Wait! Stop!

1645
03:06:14.220 --> 03:06:15.722
Stop!

1646
03:06:18.850 --> 03:06:20.560
Turn around.

1647
03:06:21.478 --> 03:06:24.230
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1648
03:06:24.314 --> 03:06:29.360
But that will lead you past isengard.

1649
03:06:29.694 --> 03:06:32.447
Yes. Exactly.

1650
03:06:32.530 --> 03:06:35.825
If we go south, we can slip
past saruman unnoticed.

1651
03:06:35.909 --> 03:06:38.661
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1652
03:06:38.745 --> 03:06:40.788
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1653
03:06:43.416 --> 03:06:46.461
That doesn't make sense to me.

1654
03:06:47.879 --> 03:06:50.632
You are very small.

1655
03:06:51.090 --> 03:06:52.884
Perhaps you're right.

1656
03:06:55.512 --> 03:06:57.055
South it is, then.

1657
03:06:58.556 --> 03:07:01.893
Hold on, little shirelings.

1658
03:07:03.937 --> 03:07:06.731
I always like going south.

1659
03:07:06.814 --> 03:07:11.152
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1660
03:07:11.778 --> 03:07:14.280
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1661
03:07:14.364 --> 03:07:16.324
No, we won't.

1662
03:07:25.959 --> 03:07:27.001
Man: Look!

1663
03:07:28.628 --> 03:07:31.130
Osgiliath burns!

1664
03:07:31.214 --> 03:07:32.674
Mordor has come.

1665
03:07:33.800 --> 03:07:36.219
The ring will not save gondor.

1666
03:07:37.554 --> 03:07:39.764
It has only the power to destroy.

1667
03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:42.141
Please...

1668
03:07:42.225 --> 03:07:43.893
Let me go.

1669
03:07:44.936 --> 03:07:46.521
Hurry.

1670
03:07:49.983 --> 03:07:51.442
Frodo: Faramir!

1671
03:07:51.526 --> 03:07:53.903
You must let me go!

1672
03:07:54.487 --> 03:07:57.991
Treebeard:
And those little family of field mice...

1673
03:07:58.074 --> 03:08:00.952
That climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1674
03:08:01.661 --> 03:08:04.998
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they...

1675
03:08:16.175 --> 03:08:19.095
Many of these trees were my friends.

1676
03:08:19.804 --> 03:08:24.434
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1677
03:08:25.602 --> 03:08:26.853
I'm sorry, treebeard.

1678
03:08:26.936 --> 03:08:29.731
They had voices of their own.

1679
03:08:31.983 --> 03:08:34.527
Saruman.

1680
03:08:34.861 --> 03:08:37.947
A wizard should know better!

1681
03:08:52.211 --> 03:08:55.923
There is no curse in elvish...

1682
03:08:56.007 --> 03:08:58.760
Entish or the tongues of men...

1683
03:08:58.843 --> 03:09:01.220
For this treachery.

1684
03:09:02.639 --> 03:09:05.475
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1685
03:09:10.188 --> 03:09:11.397
Where are they going?

1686
03:09:11.898 --> 03:09:15.151
They have business with the orcs.

1687
03:09:15.610 --> 03:09:19.947
My business is with isengard tonight...

1688
03:09:20.031 --> 03:09:22.700
With rock and stone.

1689
03:09:48.851 --> 03:09:50.269
Treebeard: Come, my friends.

1690
03:09:51.604 --> 03:09:55.858
The ents are going to war.

1691
03:09:55.942 --> 03:09:57.819
It is likely...

1692
03:09:57.902 --> 03:10:01.447
That we go to our doom.

1693
03:10:02.865 --> 03:10:05.326
Last march...

1694
03:10:05.868 --> 03:10:07.912
Of the ents.

1695
03:10:56.002 --> 03:10:59.797
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1696
03:10:59.881 --> 03:11:02.008
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1697
03:11:04.761 --> 03:11:06.220
Mr. Frodo?

1698
03:11:06.512 --> 03:11:10.683
It's calling to him, Sam.
His eye is almost on me.

1699
03:11:10.767 --> 03:11:13.311
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1700
03:11:27.617 --> 03:11:29.035
Take them to my father.

1701
03:11:30.578 --> 03:11:33.581
Tell him faramir sends a mighty gift.

1702
03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:39.045
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1703
03:11:40.213 --> 03:11:42.882
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1704
03:11:43.549 --> 03:11:46.302
You want to know
why your brother died?

1705
03:11:46.803 --> 03:11:50.598
He tried to take the ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1706
03:11:52.725 --> 03:11:55.102
The ring drove your brother mad!

1707
03:11:55.895 --> 03:11:57.730
Ithilien ranger: Watch out!

1708
03:12:08.658 --> 03:12:09.784
Mr. Frodo?

1709
03:12:12.411 --> 03:12:14.247
They're here.

1710
03:12:17.375 --> 03:12:19.836
They've come.

1711
03:12:22.421 --> 03:12:24.382
Nazgul!

1712
03:12:46.445 --> 03:12:48.614
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1713
03:12:50.408 --> 03:12:52.618
Take cover!

1714
03:13:09.969 --> 03:13:11.512
Theoden: The fortress is taken.

1715
03:13:12.305 --> 03:13:13.514
It is over.

1716
03:13:13.598 --> 03:13:17.643
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1717
03:13:17.727 --> 03:13:20.688
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1718
03:13:23.441 --> 03:13:24.817
Woman 1: They're breaking in!

1719
03:13:27.486 --> 03:13:29.989
Woman 2: They're past the door!

1720
03:13:33.326 --> 03:13:37.413
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1721
03:13:40.124 --> 03:13:42.043
Is there no other way?

1722
03:13:43.628 --> 03:13:46.672
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1723
03:13:47.340 --> 03:13:49.550
But they will not get far.
The uruk-hai are too many.

1724
03:13:54.430 --> 03:13:56.891
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1725
03:13:56.974 --> 03:13:59.852
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1726
03:14:02.021 --> 03:14:05.441
What can men do
against such reckless hate?

1727
03:14:10.112 --> 03:14:11.530
Ride out with me.

1728
03:14:15.660 --> 03:14:17.286
Ride out and meet them.

1729
03:14:18.037 --> 03:14:20.247
For death and glory.

1730
03:14:20.331 --> 03:14:21.791
For Rohan.

1731
03:14:23.292 --> 03:14:24.752
For your people.

1732
03:14:25.503 --> 03:14:27.421
The sun is rising.

1733
03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:34.971
Gandalf: Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day.

1734
03:14:36.639 --> 03:14:38.391
Look to the east.

1735
03:14:49.694 --> 03:14:52.113
The horn of helm hammerhand...

1736
03:14:52.196 --> 03:14:55.074
Shall sound in the deep...

1737
03:14:55.491 --> 03:14:57.535
One last time.

1738
03:15:02.206 --> 03:15:06.002
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1739
03:15:13.759 --> 03:15:15.094
Fell deeds, awake.

1740
03:15:16.303 --> 03:15:17.471
Now for wrath...

1741
03:15:17.555 --> 03:15:20.975
Now for ruin and a red dawn.

1742
03:15:28.024 --> 03:15:30.276
Forth eorlingas!

1743
03:16:26.582 --> 03:16:30.252
ThÃ©oden king stands alone.

1744
03:16:30.836 --> 03:16:33.005
Not alone.

1745
03:16:33.422 --> 03:16:34.548
Rohirrim!

1746
03:16:40.471 --> 03:16:41.680
Eomer.

1747
03:16:41.764 --> 03:16:44.350
To the king!

1748
03:18:12.855 --> 03:18:16.192
Treebeard: A hit. A fine hit.

1749
03:18:40.841 --> 03:18:43.344
Treebeard: Break the dam!

1750
03:18:43.427 --> 03:18:46.931
Release the river!

1751
03:19:14.250 --> 03:19:17.002
Pippin! Hold on!

1752
03:19:22.258 --> 03:19:25.177
Hold on, little hobbits.

1753
03:20:06.552 --> 03:20:08.554
What are you doing?

1754
03:20:17.146 --> 03:20:18.731
Where are you going?

1755
03:21:16.872 --> 03:21:18.207
It's me.

1756
03:21:20.709 --> 03:21:22.920
It's your Sam.

1757
03:21:27.257 --> 03:21:29.885
Don't you know your Sam?

1758
03:21:47.611 --> 03:21:50.989
I can't do this, Sam.

1759
03:21:51.865 --> 03:21:53.867
I know.

1760
03:21:54.868 --> 03:21:57.246
It's all wrong.

1761
03:21:57.996 --> 03:21:59.998
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1762
03:22:07.423 --> 03:22:09.508
But we are.

1763
03:22:15.931 --> 03:22:19.017
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1764
03:22:19.101 --> 03:22:21.520
The ones that really mattered.

1765
03:22:22.563 --> 03:22:25.607
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1766
03:22:25.691 --> 03:22:28.735
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end...

1767
03:22:28.819 --> 03:22:31.822
Because how could the end be happy?

1768
03:22:34.366 --> 03:22:36.618
How could the world go back
to the way it was...

1769
03:22:36.702 --> 03:22:40.247
When so much bad had happened?

1770
03:22:41.081 --> 03:22:43.041
Victory!

1771
03:22:43.125 --> 03:22:44.751
We have victory!

1772
03:22:44.835 --> 03:22:48.881
Sam: But in the end,
it's only a passing thing...

1773
03:22:48.964 --> 03:22:50.382
This shadow.

1774
03:22:50.466 --> 03:22:52.926
Even darkness must pass.

1775
03:22:53.010 --> 03:22:55.804
A new day will come.

1776
03:22:55.888 --> 03:22:59.892
And when the sun shines,
it will shine out the clearer.

1777
03:23:01.810 --> 03:23:04.229
Those were the stories
that stayed with you...

1778
03:23:04.313 --> 03:23:06.148
That meant something.

1779
03:23:06.231 --> 03:23:08.859
Even if you were too small
to understand why.

1780
03:23:10.235 --> 03:23:14.114
But I think, Mr. Frodo, [do understand.

1781
03:23:14.198 --> 03:23:15.824
I know now.

1782
03:23:16.658 --> 03:23:18.911
Folk in those stories...

1783
03:23:18.994 --> 03:23:23.207
Had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1784
03:23:23.290 --> 03:23:25.584
They kept going...

1785
03:23:26.251 --> 03:23:29.505
Because they were holding
on to something.

1786
03:23:31.089 --> 03:23:33.425
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1787
03:23:45.354 --> 03:23:49.274
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1788
03:23:49.566 --> 03:23:52.194
And it's worth fighting for.

1789
03:24:19.096 --> 03:24:23.392
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1790
03:24:24.142 --> 03:24:28.146
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1791
03:24:28.230 --> 03:24:30.482
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1792
03:24:38.991 --> 03:24:40.784
Release them.

1793
03:24:52.838 --> 03:24:54.923
Eomer: Stay out of the forest!

1794
03:24:55.007 --> 03:24:56.842
Keep away from the trees!

1795
03:25:47.684 --> 03:25:49.519
Final count...

1796
03:25:49.603 --> 03:25:52.606
- 42.
- Forty-two?

1797
03:25:52.689 --> 03:25:58.779
Oh, that's not bad for a pointy-eared
elvish princeling.

1798
03:25:59.571 --> 03:26:03.241
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1799
03:26:07.371 --> 03:26:10.666
- Forty-three.
- He was already dead.

1800
03:26:11.416 --> 03:26:13.960
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1801
03:26:14.044 --> 03:26:18.715
Because he's got my ax
embedded in his nervous system!

1802
03:26:21.009 --> 03:26:25.722
Merry: He doesn't look happy, does he?
Pippin: Not too happy at all, merry.

1803
03:26:25.972 --> 03:26:29.559
Still, I suppose the view
would be quite nice from up there.

1804
03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:32.688
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1805
03:26:32.771 --> 03:26:35.649
I hear the staff are very good.

1806
03:26:41.321 --> 03:26:43.740
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1807
03:26:43.824 --> 03:26:48.161
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1808
03:26:48.245 --> 03:26:49.579
I'm starving.

1809
03:26:49.663 --> 03:26:52.833
Good luck trying to find something
decent around here.

1810
03:26:52.916 --> 03:26:56.044
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1811
03:27:19.985 --> 03:27:22.404
Saruman's storeroom!

1812
03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:27.534
I don't believe it.

1813
03:27:27.617 --> 03:27:29.703
It can't be.

1814
03:27:30.328 --> 03:27:33.206
- It is!
- Longbottom leaf.

1815
03:27:34.499 --> 03:27:36.835
The finest pipe-weed in south farthing.

1816
03:27:37.169 --> 03:27:40.338
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1817
03:27:40.422 --> 03:27:41.590
Wait.

1818
03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:44.180
Do you think we should share it
with treebeard?

1819
03:27:51.016 --> 03:27:52.350
Dead plant and all that.

1820
03:27:52.768 --> 03:27:54.936
Don't think he'd understand.

1821
03:27:56.188 --> 03:27:58.398
Could be a distant relative.

1822
03:27:59.191 --> 03:28:01.735
I get it.

1823
03:28:01.818 --> 03:28:04.696
Don't be hasty.

1824
03:28:05.781 --> 03:28:07.532
Exactly.

1825
03:28:08.617 --> 03:28:10.869
Bar-hrum.

1826
03:28:36.520 --> 03:28:37.854
This is the old sewer.

1827
03:28:37.938 --> 03:28:41.149
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1828
03:28:41.233 --> 03:28:43.026
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1829
03:28:44.069 --> 03:28:46.571
Captain faramir...

1830
03:28:47.197 --> 03:28:49.032
You have shown your quality, sir.

1831
03:28:51.535 --> 03:28:52.828
The very highest.

1832
03:28:53.328 --> 03:28:55.997
The shire must truly be a great realm,
master gamgee...

1833
03:28:56.081 --> 03:28:59.084
Where gardeners are held in high honor.

1834
03:29:00.252 --> 03:29:02.254
What road will you take
once you reach the woods?

1835
03:29:02.838 --> 03:29:04.464
Gollum says there's a path...

1836
03:29:04.548 --> 03:29:08.510
Near minas morgul
that climbs up into the mountains.

1837
03:29:08.969 --> 03:29:10.720
Cirith ungol?

1838
03:29:14.266 --> 03:29:16.852
- Is that its name?
- No.

1839
03:29:19.479 --> 03:29:22.482
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1840
03:29:22.858 --> 03:29:26.403
They say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above minas morgul.

1841
03:29:27.279 --> 03:29:29.823
- You cannot go that way.
- Smeagol: It is the only way.

1842
03:29:30.156 --> 03:29:36.454
Master says we must go to mordor,
so we must try.

1843
03:29:37.956 --> 03:29:39.749
I must.

1844
03:29:43.295 --> 03:29:46.923
Go, Frodo.
Go with the goodwill of all men.

1845
03:29:47.007 --> 03:29:49.092
Thank you.

1846
03:30:00.896 --> 03:30:05.025
May death find you quickly
if you bring them to harm.

1847
03:30:17.495 --> 03:30:19.039
Sam: Come on, keep up.

1848
03:30:22.500 --> 03:30:25.295
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them rangers
to hurt you.

1849
03:30:25.921 --> 03:30:27.756
You know that, don't you?

1850
03:30:28.548 --> 03:30:30.133
He was trying to save you, see?

1851
03:30:30.634 --> 03:30:32.177
Save me?

1852
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:34.721
So there's no hard feelings.

1853
03:30:34.804 --> 03:30:40.018
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

1854
03:30:40.101 --> 03:30:42.771
Gollum, gollum.

1855
03:30:43.813 --> 03:30:45.565
Nice master.

1856
03:30:46.650 --> 03:30:49.527
- Nice hobbits.
- Sam: Very decent of you.

1857
03:30:49.611 --> 03:30:51.947
Very decent, indeed, gollum.

1858
03:30:57.452 --> 03:31:02.666
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1859
03:31:09.798 --> 03:31:12.801
Gandalf:
The battle for helm's deep is over.

1860
03:31:13.468 --> 03:31:17.013
The battle for middle-earth
is about to begin.

1861
03:31:22.143 --> 03:31:25.563
All our hopes now lie
with two little hobbits...

1862
03:31:26.564 --> 03:31:29.776
Somewhere in the wilderness.

1863
03:31:33.071 --> 03:31:36.533
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1864
03:31:36.616 --> 03:31:38.076
What?

1865
03:31:38.159 --> 03:31:42.205
I wonder if people will ever say,
"let's hear about Frodo and the ring."

1866
03:31:42.288 --> 03:31:45.625
And they'll say,
"yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1867
03:31:45.709 --> 03:31:48.753
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, dad?"

1868
03:31:48.837 --> 03:31:50.588
"Yes, my boy.

1869
03:31:50.672 --> 03:31:54.551
The most famousest of hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1870
03:31:54.634 --> 03:31:57.262
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1871
03:31:57.345 --> 03:31:59.305
"Samwise the brave."

1872
03:31:59.389 --> 03:32:02.183
I want to hear more about Sam.

1873
03:32:06.479 --> 03:32:09.482
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1874
03:32:10.817 --> 03:32:14.863
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1875
03:32:15.947 --> 03:32:17.323
So was I.

1876
03:32:26.207 --> 03:32:28.918
"Samwise the brave."

1877
03:32:33.173 --> 03:32:34.549
Frodo: SmÃ©agol?

1878
03:32:34.632 --> 03:32:37.635
Sam: We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1879
03:32:37.719 --> 03:32:39.721
Master.

1880
03:32:39.804 --> 03:32:42.807
Master looks after us.

1881
03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:46.436
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1882
03:32:46.519 --> 03:32:49.064
Gollum:
Master broke his promise.

1883
03:32:49.147 --> 03:32:51.399
Smeagol: Don't ask smÃ©agol.

1884
03:32:51.483 --> 03:32:54.778
Poor, poor smÃ©agol.

1885
03:32:54.861 --> 03:32:57.781
Master betrayed us.

1886
03:32:57.864 --> 03:33:01.034
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1887
03:33:01.117 --> 03:33:05.121
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1888
03:33:08.124 --> 03:33:09.709
Kill them both!

1889
03:33:09.793 --> 03:33:13.505
And then we take the precious...

1890
03:33:13.588 --> 03:33:17.175
And we be the master!

1891
03:33:17.842 --> 03:33:20.553
But the fat hobbit, he knows.

1892
03:33:20.637 --> 03:33:23.264
Eyes always watching.

1893
03:33:23.515 --> 03:33:27.102
Then we stabs them out.

1894
03:33:27.185 --> 03:33:31.773
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1895
03:33:31.856 --> 03:33:35.401
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1896
03:33:41.032 --> 03:33:44.786
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1897
03:33:45.495 --> 03:33:48.123
Sam:
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1898
03:33:48.206 --> 03:33:50.917
- Hey, gollum! Where are you?
- Frodo: SmÃ©agol?

1899
03:33:57.382 --> 03:34:01.594
Yes. She could do it.

1900
03:34:01.678 --> 03:34:06.307
Yes, precious, she could.

1901
03:34:06.391 --> 03:34:12.480
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1902
03:34:13.398 --> 03:34:15.191
Once they're dead.

1903
03:34:15.275 --> 03:34:17.318
Shh.

1904
03:34:20.655 --> 03:34:24.409
Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1905
03:34:24.492 --> 03:34:26.619
SmÃ©agol will show you the way.

1906
03:34:26.703 --> 03:34:28.997
Follow me.
