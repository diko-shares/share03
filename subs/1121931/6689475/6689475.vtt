00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:34.824
In a story so bizarre...

2
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.345
...I can scarcely believe
the events I'm reporting...

3
00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:39.665
...and yet corroborated
by a dozen eyewitnesses...

4
00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.865
...a white male apparently fell
from the sky...

5
00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:43.825
...above downtown
Los Angeles today...

6
00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:46.186
...landed in the middle
of a busy intersection...

7
00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:49.265
...destroying one vehicle
and hospitalizing its elderly driver...

8
00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:51.065
...and was removed from the scene...

9
00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:53.225
...before emergency personnel
could respond.

10
00:01:53.386 --> 00:01:56.586
Without a body, the police have yet
to piece together events of a day...

11
00:01:56.747 --> 00:01:59.466
...that can only be described
as implausible.

12
00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:02.026
Reports of a body
landing in the Boyle Heights area...

13
00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:04.707
...have yet to be confirmed,
and are being treated...

14
00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.786
...as the bullshit they most likely are.

15
00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:22.355
You big cock English.

16
00:04:22.516 --> 00:04:24.275
Strong like horse.

17
00:04:56.318 --> 00:04:57.997
Fuck that.

18
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.999
That's not so bad.

19
00:06:17.563 --> 00:06:19.122
Nice.

20
00:06:31.004 --> 00:06:32.842
Pick up, Eve.

21
00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:36.163
The number you have reached
is not in service.

22
00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:37.603
Fuck.

23
00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:41.403
Shit.

24
00:06:44.885 --> 00:06:46.283
You lost?

25
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:48.444
Nope.

26
00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:56.410
Shit.

27
00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.409
On your knees, Slim.

28
00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:09.929
Okay, Chow Mein.

29
00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:12.409
- Who do you work for?
- Fuck you, Chelios.

30
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.049
Fucking grunt.

31
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.931
You found me in quite an unpleasant
mood this morning, mate.

32
00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:39.971
Now, I'm gonna ask you this question
one time.

33
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.331
Who's gots my fucking
strawberry tart?

34
00:08:47.372 --> 00:08:49.011
Capiche?

35
00:08:53.413 --> 00:08:55.412
Just spit the fucking name out.

36
00:08:55.573 --> 00:08:56.932
Johnny Vang!

37
00:08:57.093 --> 00:09:00.492
Johnny fucking Vang?
Johnny fucking Vang?

38
00:09:00.653 --> 00:09:03.212
- Good boy. Where?
- Cypress Social Club!

39
00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:06.212
Cypress- Cypress Social Club.

40
00:09:06.373 --> 00:09:08.733
Now, you're sure about that, ain't you?

41
00:09:08.894 --> 00:09:10.852
Good boy. Thanks for coming.

42
00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:12.693
Now, you can keep that.

43
00:10:17.257 --> 00:10:18.537
Fuck.

44
00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:34.698
Hello. Doc Miles.

45
00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:36.697
Yeah, Doc, it's Chev.

46
00:10:38.059 --> 00:10:39.738
Jesus H. Chelios.

47
00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:41.098
You gotta be kidding me.

48
00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:43.058
Listen. I'm deadly
fucking serious, Doc.

49
00:10:43.219 --> 00:10:45.579
These Triad motherfuckers
cut out my fucking heart...

50
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.659
...and put in one of those
artificial jobs.

51
00:10:47.819 --> 00:10:49.738
You got an artificial heart?

52
00:10:50.979 --> 00:10:52.859
You think I'm having a fucking laugh?

53
00:10:53.019 --> 00:10:55.179
No, but you gotta admit,
it's a little out there.

54
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.619
- You take your fucking time, Doc.
- You don't have any time.

55
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.979
They're not designed to keep you alive
more than a couple of days.

56
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.940
- And don't do anything strenuous.
- Yeah, sure, Doc. No problem.

57
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.499
So, what's my next fucking move?

58
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:09.260
We gotta get a real heart put in you,
preferably your own.

59
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:10.900
- I'm on it.
- Okay, you're on it.

60
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:13.900
- Doc, Jesus fucking Christ!
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

61
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:17.100
Let me- Does that thing
have a belt battery pack?

62
00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:20.100
- Check.
- How many bars are showing?

63
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:23.141
- One.
- Shit. That's better than none, I guess.

64
00:11:23.302 --> 00:11:26.781
Look, what they did you with
is an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

65
00:11:28.942 --> 00:11:32.141
It's got an internal battery that'll
pick up once the belt battery dies.

66
00:11:32.302 --> 00:11:33.901
It's like a reserve tank.

67
00:11:34.062 --> 00:11:37.662
Once the internal battery takes over,
you got one fucking hour.

68
00:11:37.823 --> 00:11:39.661
The internal battery
charges wirelessly...

69
00:11:39.822 --> 00:11:42.302
...through a transcutaneous
energy-transfer system.

70
00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:45.182
Two coils-
There's one internal, one external.

71
00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:47.902
- that transmit via a magnetic force
across the skin...

72
00:11:48.063 --> 00:11:49.982
...without piercing the surface.

73
00:11:50.143 --> 00:11:53.303
The internal coil receives power
and sends it to the controller device.

74
00:11:53.464 --> 00:11:55.943
Does this make any fucking sense
to you, Chevy?

75
00:11:56.104 --> 00:11:58.302
It's fucking Greek, Doc.

76
00:11:58.463 --> 00:12:00.263
Greek.

77
00:12:00.424 --> 00:12:02.824
Look, you gotta keep your body
electrically charged...

78
00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:05.424
- ... to keep that piece of shit pumping.
- Copy that.

79
00:12:05.584 --> 00:12:07.143
- Hey, Chev?
- Yeah.

80
00:12:07.304 --> 00:12:10.383
- I'm stoked you're alive, dude.
- I'll get back to you, Doc.

81
00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:11.584
Yeah. Call me.

82
00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.664
Fuck.

83
00:12:16.785 --> 00:12:18.704
Hey, hey, hey! That's a nice car.

84
00:12:18.865 --> 00:12:21.704
Don't suppose you know where
the Cypress Social Club is, do you?

85
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.625
Man, fuck that shit, puto.
Let's race, ése.

86
00:12:25.785 --> 00:12:27.264
Don't you tempt me, fucker.

87
00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:29.745
What I need from you is directions.

88
00:12:54.947 --> 00:13:00.197
Shit.

89
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:26.148
Damn, dog. You good, ése?

90
00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:28.868
Tiger fucking Woods.

91
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:31.028
Never better.

92
00:13:31.349 --> 00:13:32.749
Greatest day of my fucking life.

93
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.909
You couldn't point me in the direction
of the Cypress Social Club, could you?

94
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.189
Well, you ain't too far.

95
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.550
Go down Orange for, like, 2 miles,
and then you're there, homes.

96
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.350
You mind giving me a jump?

97
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:03.471
Just juice me.

98
00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:50.954
Anybody know
where's the fucking Social Club?

99
00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:57.754
Donde esta la Social Club?

100
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:06.474
Buenos nachos, white boy.

101
00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:12.635
This is a fucking social club?

102
00:15:21.117 --> 00:15:23.036
You Johnny Vang?

103
00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:04.118
Go.

104
00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:35.320
- Get lost, bitch.
- Fuck you.

105
00:16:38.361 --> 00:16:40.120
- What?
- Where's Johnny Vang?

106
00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:42.041
You looking to get your ass killed?

107
00:16:44.242 --> 00:16:46.640
- Wrong expression.
- You ain't tapping my ass.

108
00:16:49.602 --> 00:16:51.761
There you go, cupcake.

109
00:16:55.922 --> 00:16:58.561
Fucking no balling
for me today, thanks.

110
00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:01.281
There goes my ride!

111
00:17:05.402 --> 00:17:06.882
What is that? Fucking cunt-onese?

112
00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:09.882
I'd rather stick my dick in a blender.

113
00:17:11.203 --> 00:17:12.802
Sticky me.

114
00:17:14.523 --> 00:17:15.682
Hey!

115
00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:30.324
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

116
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.523
Where?

117
00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:43.524
Hey, dude, why do you run?

118
00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:45.124
Wait for me!

119
00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:48.324
Get out of the fucking car!

120
00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:53.845
- Out!
- Get your own station wagon, asshole!

121
00:17:54.326 --> 00:17:56.325
Get the fuck off!

122
00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.565
Damn.

123
00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:00.965
Fuck.

124
00:18:01.766 --> 00:18:03.485
You taking it too fast with me.

125
00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:06.325
- Which way?
- I want you to take it slow.

126
00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:08.006
Which way?

127
00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:12.966
Hey! Hey.

128
00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.046
You didn't ask name.

129
00:18:16.967 --> 00:18:18.887
Shut up a minute, for fuck's sake.

130
00:18:19.607 --> 00:18:21.087
Where is he?

131
00:18:22.688 --> 00:18:24.006
- Johnny Vang?
- Yes.

132
00:18:26.248 --> 00:18:27.807
Motherfucker!

133
00:18:37.168 --> 00:18:38.328
Baby.

134
00:18:58.569 --> 00:19:00.449
Motherfucking Chelios!

135
00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.329
You like sushi, Chinese man?

136
00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:19.690
How the fuck am I supposed
to know what kind of "ese" you is...

137
00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:21.770
...you slanty-eyed fuck?

138
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.690
Check it out.

139
00:19:23.851 --> 00:19:25.490
Sushi.

140
00:19:42.092 --> 00:19:43.851
Hey, Chico.

141
00:19:48.013 --> 00:19:49.571
We can make a deal, huh?

142
00:19:55.013 --> 00:19:57.012
Oh, yeah.

143
00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:59.052
Come on. Come on.

144
00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:09.453
My girl.

145
00:20:13.494 --> 00:20:14.494
Eve.

146
00:20:18.534 --> 00:20:19.814
Eve?

147
00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:42.255
Here, baby.

148
00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:51.376
Eve?

149
00:20:55.457 --> 00:20:57.096
Chev?

150
00:21:00.178 --> 00:21:03.216
Hey, I need you to take your
fucking hands off Lemon now, man.

151
00:21:03.377 --> 00:21:05.377
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who the fuck am I?

152
00:21:05.537 --> 00:21:07.857
Who the fuck are you?
You know this guy, Lemon?

153
00:21:08.818 --> 00:21:09.777
Lemon.

154
00:21:11.018 --> 00:21:12.417
You were dead.

155
00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:15.377
I'm-

156
00:21:15.538 --> 00:21:17.578
I'm so confused right now.

157
00:21:17.739 --> 00:21:20.137
- What's that ticking sound?
- Yeah, what is that sound?

158
00:21:20.299 --> 00:21:23.178
You're kind of weird, tick-man.
It's time for you to go.

159
00:21:26.099 --> 00:21:28.018
- Randy?
- Randy?

160
00:21:28.178 --> 00:21:29.898
Come here.

161
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.020
Not you. Babe, it's-

162
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.260
Who the fuck is that?

163
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.140
Some whore.

164
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.659
Fuck, no. Fuck.

165
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.580
- Look, she's helping me find my heart.
- What?

166
00:22:01.381 --> 00:22:02.820
Go away. Come on, let's go.

167
00:22:05.101 --> 00:22:06.100
Baby.

168
00:22:07.701 --> 00:22:08.820
What?

169
00:22:13.581 --> 00:22:15.701
Oh, you dozy cunt.

170
00:22:16.342 --> 00:22:17.661
Baby-

171
00:22:24.822 --> 00:22:26.582
No.

172
00:22:26.983 --> 00:22:28.502
We need his ass alive.

173
00:22:28.662 --> 00:22:31.702
Chev Chelios,
let's save some bullets, dude.

174
00:22:31.863 --> 00:22:33.782
Put that away.
We've all had a drink.

175
00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:35.022
Should I duck?

176
00:22:35.183 --> 00:22:36.782
Yeah.

177
00:23:32.586 --> 00:23:35.226
Shall we bypass the formalities?

178
00:23:35.387 --> 00:23:37.306
Of course.

179
00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:40.826
Who do you work for, and what
the fuck do they want with me?

180
00:23:40.987 --> 00:23:42.226
El Huron.

181
00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:45.386
English. Who's the fucking El Huton?

182
00:23:45.547 --> 00:23:47.507
It's The Ferret.

183
00:23:48.947 --> 00:23:52.987
He wants you alive,
so he can watch you die.

184
00:23:53.147 --> 00:23:54.907
Oh, yeah?

185
00:23:55.068 --> 00:23:57.467
- Why?
- I don't know.

186
00:23:57.948 --> 00:23:59.507
Doesn't everybody?

187
00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:02.308
Shut up.

188
00:24:03.228 --> 00:24:05.067
You lucky bastard.

189
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:15.388
Eve, let's go.

190
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.829
Get on the floor now!

191
00:24:36.191 --> 00:24:37.150
Turn around.

192
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:44.270
Oh, it's on now.

193
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:47.870
- No! Stop! Stop!
- Put her down.

194
00:25:00.472 --> 00:25:02.191
Stop it!

195
00:25:02.432 --> 00:25:03.471
No!

196
00:25:56.156 --> 00:25:57.475
Why didn't you call me?

197
00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:00.714
Like fuck I didn't.
Didn't you get my message?

198
00:26:03.556 --> 00:26:05.915
No. Where have you been
for the last three months?

199
00:26:06.076 --> 00:26:07.115
I thought you were dead.

200
00:26:07.276 --> 00:26:09.915
I fell a mile out of a helicopter,
that's all. True story.

201
00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:12.596
No way. You know what?
That's totally possible.

202
00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:14.275
I saw this video on YouTube...

203
00:26:14.436 --> 00:26:17.476
...where this guy's parachute doesn't
open, he falls 14,000 feet...

204
00:26:17.637 --> 00:26:18.716
...and he lives.

205
00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:22.636
Yes, baby, I know it's possible,
because I fucking did it!

206
00:26:22.797 --> 00:26:25.036
- Quit it.
- Since when were you on the Internet?

207
00:26:25.197 --> 00:26:27.236
A lot of things have changed
since you died.

208
00:26:27.398 --> 00:26:28.956
I didn't fucking die.

209
00:26:29.117 --> 00:26:31.996
Well, that's besides the point, isn't it?

210
00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:34.597
Hey!

211
00:26:41.959 --> 00:26:44.398
- Where are we going, Chev?
- I don't know.

212
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.558
I need to find that slob from the club,
the one with the red cooler.

213
00:26:47.719 --> 00:26:49.718
Are you talking about Johnny Vang?

214
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.199
- You know Johnny Vang?
- I know his ass.

215
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.679
He's got the box with him all the time.

216
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.358
That box, I need it.

217
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.880
I can bet on my grandma's coochie
he's at the horse track.

218
00:27:17.481 --> 00:27:19.999
Dude, you gonna put Johnny Vang
on ice?

219
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.720
- Maybe.
- That's so fucking sexy.

220
00:27:25.641 --> 00:27:28.520
- Fucking dead.
- Didn't they cuff you?

221
00:27:31.241 --> 00:27:32.920
Damn it. Do me.

222
00:27:33.081 --> 00:27:35.080
I'll do you.

223
00:27:38.122 --> 00:27:39.681
Bitch.

224
00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.041
Atta girl. I gotta call Doc.
I need that cell phone.

225
00:27:44.202 --> 00:27:47.081
Why didn't you just say it?
I have a cell phone.

226
00:27:47.842 --> 00:27:48.921
Here.

227
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:55.962
You got a cell phone.

228
00:27:56.123 --> 00:27:58.361
I got you, okay?

229
00:27:58.523 --> 00:28:00.522
You gotta work for the things that-

230
00:28:00.683 --> 00:28:03.122
- Chevy?
- I lost the belt battery, Doc.

231
00:28:03.284 --> 00:28:04.923
- How long ago?
- Over an hour.

232
00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:08.043
Jesus Christ. That's not fucking
possible, Chevy. You should be d-

233
00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:09.603
Fuck it. Never mind. Look.

234
00:28:09.763 --> 00:28:13.042
It's a wireless system, so any low-level
electrical shock to your skin...

235
00:28:13.204 --> 00:28:15.203
...should juice it at least temporarily.

236
00:28:15.364 --> 00:28:17.284
Hey, Chev?
I'm a certified heart surgeon.

237
00:28:17.444 --> 00:28:18.843
Well, I was.

238
00:28:19.004 --> 00:28:21.364
Lost my license after I fucked up
my ex-wife's...

239
00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:23.203
...vaginal rejuvenation procedure.

240
00:28:23.364 --> 00:28:24.603
That's irrelevant right now.

241
00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:28.324
The point is, if you can get your heart,
I'm sure I can put it back in for you.

242
00:28:28.485 --> 00:28:32.284
I'll be in touch when I find that Chinese
cocksucker that's got me pump.

243
00:28:34.485 --> 00:28:36.205
Bet you even had
to choose between-

244
00:28:36.365 --> 00:28:37.965
Chinese.

245
00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:41.645
Sharon, I just shut down, okay?
I couldn't think. I couldn't feel.

246
00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:45.485
Hey, Chocolate? Would you get
off your fat ass and get dressed?

247
00:28:46.766 --> 00:28:48.445
Why?

248
00:28:50.446 --> 00:28:52.365
Is Doc Miles gonna
have to choke a bitch?

249
00:28:52.527 --> 00:28:55.845
You know that I was waiting
for those results too?

250
00:28:56.006 --> 00:28:59.646
- I needed to put things in perspective.
- Oh, you needed? You needed?

251
00:28:59.806 --> 00:29:02.406
I think I know who we're dealing with.

252
00:29:03.087 --> 00:29:04.806
Hell no, we won't blow.

253
00:29:04.967 --> 00:29:06.966
Hell no, we won't suck.

254
00:29:07.127 --> 00:29:09.206
Hell no, we won't blow.

255
00:29:09.367 --> 00:29:12.166
Hell no, we won't suck.

256
00:29:15.408 --> 00:29:18.367
Move! Jesus. Shit.

257
00:29:20.688 --> 00:29:21.807
What the fuck!

258
00:29:22.248 --> 00:29:23.248
Shit.

259
00:29:24.128 --> 00:29:25.887
That's right. You're gonna pay me!

260
00:29:26.048 --> 00:29:27.247
We want to make a living.

261
00:29:27.408 --> 00:29:30.127
You carry weapons,
we carry weapons in our pants.

262
00:29:30.288 --> 00:29:31.568
We're sick and tired of this.

263
00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:34.048
Pay me my fucking wages,
motherfuckers.

264
00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:35.848
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

265
00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:37.168
They need their money.

266
00:29:37.329 --> 00:29:41.648
You want me to fuck this car?

267
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.248
- Suck my fucking tits.
- Get off the car.

268
00:29:46.449 --> 00:29:48.129
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back.

269
00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.769
- Hi.
- Give me my money.

270
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:52.209
We're sick and tired of this.

271
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:54.889
Just because it's porn
doesn't mean we don't wanna do it.

272
00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.449
This is a weird scene. We've got
pissed-off beaver. I'm in pursuit.

273
00:30:14.252 --> 00:30:15.611
Cunt.

274
00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:21.891
Sit.

275
00:30:22.052 --> 00:30:23.531
Good-

276
00:30:24.932 --> 00:30:27.651
- I'm just making sure.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

277
00:30:27.812 --> 00:30:29.571
Well, he's gotta know who's in charge.

278
00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:30.931
Dude, come on.

279
00:30:31.092 --> 00:30:33.292
- He's gonna eat somebody's baby-
- Chill.

280
00:30:33.453 --> 00:30:36.012
- You're gonna get sued.
- He's doing what he's supposed to.

281
00:30:36.173 --> 00:30:37.772
Whatever. I wanted a cat.

282
00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:39.332
Fuck.

283
00:30:44.093 --> 00:30:46.292
- See? Way better than a cat, man.
- Whatever.

284
00:30:47.133 --> 00:30:48.372
Who's this fucking asshole?

285
00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:50.932
You pair of sausage noodles.

286
00:30:51.093 --> 00:30:53.132
How do you sleep at night?

287
00:30:53.294 --> 00:30:55.893
I'm from PETA.
This is animal cruelty, you fuckers.

288
00:30:56.054 --> 00:30:58.773
- Give that back, you liberal freak.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:30:58.934 --> 00:31:01.333
- Fucking shame on you two. I tell you.
- That's $250.

290
00:31:01.494 --> 00:31:03.653
- Pair of cunts. Press the button.
- Take it back.

291
00:31:03.814 --> 00:31:05.294
- Hit him.
- Listen-

292
00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:08.294
- Disgusting.
- Morning.

293
00:31:08.454 --> 00:31:10.054
Mom would be so proud.

294
00:31:10.215 --> 00:31:12.694
- Sorry about that. Give me that thing.
- No.

295
00:31:14.695 --> 00:31:16.535
Yeah, there you go. Go on.

296
00:31:18.415 --> 00:31:20.375
You don't press that button,
you're going.

297
00:31:20.535 --> 00:31:22.614
- I'm pressing it.
- Press it!

298
00:31:23.656 --> 00:31:25.575
Come on, what's the matter?
Fucking wake up.

299
00:31:25.735 --> 00:31:28.335
- Make him press the button, you-
- Give him the fucking-

300
00:31:31.096 --> 00:31:33.255
- What are you, fucking useless?
- Hey!

301
00:31:33.696 --> 00:31:35.095
Stop right there!

302
00:31:37.816 --> 00:31:38.775
Oh, shit.

303
00:31:41.096 --> 00:31:42.416
See? He lost it. I told you.

304
00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:49.976
Get him off!

305
00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:55.016
Will our insurance cover that?

306
00:32:01.858 --> 00:32:03.097
- Get down!
- Cover your head!

307
00:32:03.258 --> 00:32:06.137
- On the ground!
- What the fuck is around your neck?

308
00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:11.498
Are you fucking kidding me?

309
00:32:16.379 --> 00:32:18.258
Kaylo?

310
00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:21.618
- Get on.
- Both of you down on the ground now!

311
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.858
Kaylo, I thought you were dead.

312
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.379
My name's Venus. I'm from Hollywood.

313
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.659
Kaylo was my brother.

314
00:32:48.701 --> 00:32:51.020
Brother? No shit.

315
00:32:51.421 --> 00:32:53.380
Hey, what the fuck
did you hit me for anyway?

316
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:57.020
I have a condition.
FBT, Full Body Tourette's.

317
00:32:57.182 --> 00:32:58.180
I can't control myself.

318
00:32:59.502 --> 00:33:01.301
Jesus! Fuck!

319
00:33:01.462 --> 00:33:03.581
God! What the-?

320
00:33:04.702 --> 00:33:07.261
Motherfuck.

321
00:33:09.262 --> 00:33:11.261
Hey, listen.
I'm sorry about your brother.

322
00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:13.621
I need to get to the
Hollywood Park racetrack...

323
00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:15.422
...and I mean right the fuck now.

324
00:33:19.742 --> 00:33:22.782
What's the matter,
you hurting or something?

325
00:33:27.903 --> 00:33:29.823
- Is that where they're at?
- Who?

326
00:33:29.984 --> 00:33:33.062
The sucker that killed my brother.
You're Chev "the cheese" Chelios?

327
00:33:33.224 --> 00:33:36.223
The sickest motherfucker that ever
vaporized a motherfucker, right?

328
00:33:36.384 --> 00:33:40.583
- Yeah. That's me.
- Yeah. So when you get those suckers-

329
00:33:41.584 --> 00:33:44.143
Get a grip of yourself.
It's already done.

330
00:33:44.744 --> 00:33:45.983
It's done.

331
00:33:46.145 --> 00:33:48.983
I already took care
of the ones that did Kaylo.

332
00:33:49.504 --> 00:33:52.304
- But- All of them?
- All of them.

333
00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:54.584
D- E-A-D. Brown Bread.

334
00:33:54.745 --> 00:33:56.784
- Right Said Fred?
- Simply Red.

335
00:33:56.945 --> 00:33:58.464
I see.

336
00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:01.024
Don't look so gloomy, Elvis.

337
00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:03.545
I can assure you
they did not die pleasantly.

338
00:34:03.706 --> 00:34:05.664
No. You don't understand.

339
00:34:05.825 --> 00:34:07.425
It's a matter of honor.

340
00:34:07.585 --> 00:34:10.145
It should have been me
to avenge my brother's death.

341
00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:13.185
Well, so long, Chelios.

342
00:34:14.546 --> 00:34:16.505
My brain hurts.

343
00:34:17.466 --> 00:34:20.785
There is one that I never got to,
on account of I could never find him.

344
00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:23.746
- The one that calls himself The Ferret.
- El Huron?

345
00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:25.866
- You know him?
- No.

346
00:34:26.027 --> 00:34:29.626
- That means "the ferret" in Spanish.
- Right. Yeah, I knew that.

347
00:34:29.787 --> 00:34:33.146
Listen, you want to find the dude that
made your brother dead, you find him.

348
00:34:36.468 --> 00:34:38.147
Chev?

349
00:34:39.468 --> 00:34:41.427
Racetrack.

350
00:34:43.308 --> 00:34:45.027
You're here.

351
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:21.750
That you, Chelios?

352
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.590
- I'm running on empty, Doc.
- Same here, buddy.

353
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.910
I'm gonna need to stick my dick
in a socket.

354
00:35:28.071 --> 00:35:32.069
- I don't recommend that. But friction-
- Friction?

355
00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:35.430
Yeah. Skin-on-skin contact
creates static electricity.

356
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:36.790
You're kidding me, right?

357
00:35:36.951 --> 00:35:41.190
Dude, the friction of two like objects
causes a transfer of electrons.

358
00:35:41.352 --> 00:35:43.271
Science 101, Chevy.

359
00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:46.231
Probably ditched that class. I did.

360
00:35:46.792 --> 00:35:50.111
Find someone to rub against.
It's gonna help.

361
00:35:50.272 --> 00:35:51.871
Well, it's not gonna hurt.

362
00:35:57.192 --> 00:35:59.271
Terrific race.

363
00:36:01.032 --> 00:36:02.952
That's a great horse, mate.

364
00:36:04.233 --> 00:36:05.832
What the fuck, man?

365
00:36:06.313 --> 00:36:07.912
- What the fuck?
- You did it.

366
00:36:09.273 --> 00:36:11.312
Mate, that was all you.

367
00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:24.073
Yo, man.

368
00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:32.194
Fucking Doc.

369
00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:40.354
Hey there, mister.
Somebody stop him! Stop him.

370
00:36:40.515 --> 00:36:41.514
- Chev.
- No!

371
00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.635
The horse! The horse!

372
00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:47.875
Get out of there!

373
00:36:48.956 --> 00:36:50.475
Please.

374
00:37:00.357 --> 00:37:02.956
Hey. Wait, wait. Chill out.
He's just had too many drinks.

375
00:37:03.117 --> 00:37:04.996
I got him. Okay?
Go about your business.

376
00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:06.956
- All right.
- Honey, let's go.

377
00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:08.876
- My heart.
- Oh, I love you too.

378
00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:12.476
Honey, come on. Over here.

379
00:37:14.157 --> 00:37:15.516
Are you okay?

380
00:37:15.677 --> 00:37:17.436
Is it the Chinese poison?

381
00:37:18.077 --> 00:37:19.756
Friction.

382
00:37:21.598 --> 00:37:24.676
Doc said friction.

383
00:37:31.038 --> 00:37:32.718
Chev.

384
00:37:34.478 --> 00:37:35.917
Friction.

385
00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:39.757
Friction?

386
00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:45.038
- I'll give you friction.
- Yeah.

387
00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:46.319
Yeah.

388
00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:49.798
- Babe, what are you doing?
- I know how this game works.

389
00:37:50.359 --> 00:37:52.238
- Oh, yeah. It's working, baby.
- Okay.

390
00:37:52.399 --> 00:37:53.638
Yeah. Fuck.

391
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.879
Keep going, doll.

392
00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:58.159
Rub it, baby.

393
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.239
- Yeah, rub it.
- Fucking good.

394
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.799
Rub it!

395
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.760
- Oh, my God. It's gross.
- Hey!

396
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.080
No.

397
00:38:19.361 --> 00:38:21.440
Oh, baby.

398
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:28.681
Fuck, it's working, Eve.

399
00:38:28.842 --> 00:38:31.081
Oh, smash it fucking good, babe.
Come on.

400
00:38:33.802 --> 00:38:36.242
Come on, you motherfucker.

401
00:38:36.402 --> 00:38:38.081
You fucking nailed it, Doc.

402
00:38:38.242 --> 00:38:39.681
You fucking got it, doctor!

403
00:38:39.842 --> 00:38:41.481
- I got it!
- Come on, doctor!

404
00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:50.282
Come on, babe, let's switch.

405
00:39:02.964 --> 00:39:04.403
Give the kitty some cream, baby.

406
00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:07.563
Give the kitty some more cream.
Move your-

407
00:39:09.845 --> 00:39:10.804
Fucking it!

408
00:39:18.725 --> 00:39:21.204
I fucking love you. I love you so much.

409
00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:08.407
Eve.

410
00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:10.407
Stop!

411
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:35.529
Yo, help us out, man!

412
00:40:38.209 --> 00:40:39.929
Door number 6.

413
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.129
Come on, man!

414
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:56.410
Fucking useless.

415
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:57.890
Yeah?

416
00:40:58.051 --> 00:41:00.970
Well, you ain't no
Ralph Macchio yourself, Chev!

417
00:41:22.292 --> 00:41:24.092
Go!

418
00:41:38.413 --> 00:41:40.732
Oh, fuck!

419
00:41:43.213 --> 00:41:45.453
Did I drop some change,
or did I hear a chink?

420
00:41:45.614 --> 00:41:47.533
Oh, my God!

421
00:41:47.694 --> 00:41:49.693
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck me?

422
00:41:50.334 --> 00:41:52.173
Give me the fucking box!

423
00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:59.214
Fuck you, Chelios!

424
00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:16.095
Get in.

425
00:42:27.457 --> 00:42:30.655
- Chev Chelios.
- Don motherfucking Kim.

426
00:42:30.816 --> 00:42:34.016
So you pull my lily-white ass
out of the hot grease again.

427
00:42:37.377 --> 00:42:39.536
Please, don't thank me.

428
00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:43.576
I don't think I shall. I'm not sure
if you're aware of this, Jeeves...

429
00:42:43.737 --> 00:42:46.497
...but your slant-eyed associates
have taken something...

430
00:42:46.658 --> 00:42:48.057
...of extreme value to me.

431
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:49.856
And I intend to get it back.

432
00:42:50.018 --> 00:42:51.617
You know what you are,
Chev Chelios?

433
00:42:52.177 --> 00:42:53.377
Tell me.

434
00:42:53.538 --> 00:42:57.537
You are a shit magnet.

435
00:43:15.299 --> 00:43:18.818
Your friend has the gay condition.

436
00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:22.819
And now, where were we?

437
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.459
You were about to tell me
exactly who's got what I need and why.

438
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:29.779
You may have heard
of the name Poon Dong.

439
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.300
- Only in dirty limericks.
- The patriarch of our organization.

440
00:43:35.461 --> 00:43:37.500
Said to be 100 years old.

441
00:43:37.661 --> 00:43:41.020
Considered to be more god than man
by the Triad gangs.

442
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:43.220
But several months ago,
word had spread out...

443
00:43:43.381 --> 00:43:45.700
...that Poon Dong
had taken gravely ill.

444
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:49.221
And without a heart transplant,
he only had a few days left to live.

445
00:43:55.262 --> 00:43:58.021
- I see.
- Of course, that was unacceptable.

446
00:43:58.182 --> 00:43:59.861
Many would have given their hearts...

447
00:44:00.022 --> 00:44:03.101
...from their own breasts
to save the life of Poon Dong.

448
00:44:03.262 --> 00:44:05.461
But not me. Fuck that.

449
00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:06.622
But many.

450
00:44:06.783 --> 00:44:08.902
Then word spread out
that there was a man...

451
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:11.382
...who had a heart so powerful
that he was capable...

452
00:44:11.543 --> 00:44:15.582
...of surviving even our most deadliest
of poisons.

453
00:44:19.503 --> 00:44:22.422
- The Chinese shit.
- Yes.

454
00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:25.143
It was you, Chev Chelios.

455
00:44:25.303 --> 00:44:29.463
It was your heart that Poon Dong
chose to replace his own.

456
00:44:30.224 --> 00:44:31.623
One more question.

457
00:44:31.784 --> 00:44:34.943
Who the fuck is El Huron, The Ferret?

458
00:44:35.104 --> 00:44:37.184
And how is he involved with all this?

459
00:44:37.345 --> 00:44:39.063
The Ferret?

460
00:44:46.545 --> 00:44:52.224
Let's just say our organizations
have a history of conflicting interests.

461
00:44:52.385 --> 00:44:54.185
I see.

462
00:44:54.385 --> 00:44:56.905
Well, it's mighty white of you
to help me out like this.

463
00:44:57.066 --> 00:44:58.425
Now, if you don't mind.

464
00:44:58.586 --> 00:44:59.985
Who said I was helping you out?

465
00:45:00.145 --> 00:45:04.745
My reward for returning you
to Poon Dong will be great.

466
00:45:04.906 --> 00:45:10.585
- So this is how it is.
- This is how it is.

467
00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:40.667
Chicken and broccoli.

468
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:28.270
- Dude, are you all right?
- Never better.

469
00:46:35.272 --> 00:46:38.151
Fish Halman here, bringing you
breaking on-the-scenes coverage...

470
00:46:38.312 --> 00:46:40.511
...of an explosion of mayhem,
and lewd behavior...

471
00:46:40.671 --> 00:46:42.511
...that has swept the Long Beach area.

472
00:46:42.672 --> 00:46:45.231
Our viewers may remember
a similar series of incidents...

473
00:46:45.392 --> 00:46:47.151
...which took place
three months back...

474
00:46:47.312 --> 00:46:49.792
...involving this unidentified man.

475
00:46:49.953 --> 00:46:52.071
Police are now confirming
that today's events...

476
00:46:52.232 --> 00:46:55.232
...are the work
of that very same psychotic deviant.

477
00:46:55.393 --> 00:46:58.272
Ted Garcia is standing by
in Hollywood Park with a live report.

478
00:46:58.433 --> 00:47:00.152
- Take it away, Ted.
- Thanks, Fish.

479
00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:02.152
I'm standing here
with a group of people-

480
00:47:02.314 --> 00:47:04.872
Families, seniors,
and degenerate gamblers.

481
00:47:05.034 --> 00:47:08.313
- that are shocked and traumatized by
what they've witnessed here today...

482
00:47:08.474 --> 00:47:11.353
...when what started as a sunny,
Southern California afternoon...

483
00:47:11.514 --> 00:47:16.193
...at the races turned, without warning,
into a public, open-air porno.

484
00:47:16.354 --> 00:47:17.793
Did you say porno, Ted?

485
00:47:17.955 --> 00:47:19.113
Straight up, Fish.

486
00:47:19.274 --> 00:47:21.914
I'd like you to meet Glenda Lansing
of Hawaiian Gardens.

487
00:47:22.075 --> 00:47:25.354
Glenda says she had an all-too-
up-close-and-personal encounter...

488
00:47:25.515 --> 00:47:28.994
...with the suspect just moments
before the shocking incident occurred.

489
00:47:29.435 --> 00:47:32.834
That bastard had his filthy hands
all over me.

490
00:47:32.995 --> 00:47:34.794
Can you describe exactly
what happened?

491
00:47:34.956 --> 00:47:38.115
I never saw a bastard
who wanted it so bad.

492
00:47:38.275 --> 00:47:41.714
He put his filthy hands
on every part of me.

493
00:47:41.876 --> 00:47:44.635
Okay, that's a little too much
information for this broadcast.

494
00:47:44.796 --> 00:47:46.715
Can you describe
the man that assaulted you?

495
00:47:46.876 --> 00:47:49.195
He looked like that fella
from the movies.

496
00:47:49.876 --> 00:47:51.156
The T-Bag.

497
00:47:51.316 --> 00:47:52.555
T- Bag?

498
00:47:52.716 --> 00:47:55.636
You know, the Trainspotted fella?

499
00:47:55.797 --> 00:47:58.196
- Built like a brick shit house.
- All right, ma'am.

500
00:47:58.357 --> 00:48:01.196
You know that kind of language
is not gonna fly on TV.

501
00:48:01.997 --> 00:48:03.476
That son of a bitch.

502
00:48:03.637 --> 00:48:06.797
He treated me like his hot little whore.

503
00:48:07.797 --> 00:48:10.037
Explain to me...

504
00:48:10.557 --> 00:48:15.077
...how you let this motherfucker
get away.

505
00:48:15.838 --> 00:48:18.837
He just went buck wild
and killed everybody.

506
00:48:18.998 --> 00:48:20.197
But not you.

507
00:48:21.718 --> 00:48:22.678
I just got lucky, eh?

508
00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:27.318
You know the drill, bitch.

509
00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:36.878
Do it.

510
00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:46.679
Do it!

511
00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.840
Now the other one.

512
00:49:32.682 --> 00:49:34.522
You got yourself another chance.

513
00:49:34.963 --> 00:49:37.402
I don't think you'll fuck it up next time.

514
00:49:37.563 --> 00:49:40.482
Now go get yourself a Band-Aid.

515
00:49:40.643 --> 00:49:42.803
And go get me
fucking Chelios, cabron!

516
00:50:00.885 --> 00:50:03.443
That's the last time.
The last time that son of a bitch...

517
00:50:03.605 --> 00:50:06.444
...leaves me with my ass in the wind
in front of 8,000 people!

518
00:50:09.964 --> 00:50:11.604
- Lemon. Hey, hey, hey!
- Randy?

519
00:50:11.765 --> 00:50:13.044
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

520
00:50:13.205 --> 00:50:14.524
It's about the dude.

521
00:50:14.685 --> 00:50:15.644
What dude?

522
00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:17.244
- The asshole.
- What about him?

523
00:50:17.405 --> 00:50:20.524
He's on every channel. The guy's
a fucking psycho killer, baby.

524
00:50:20.685 --> 00:50:24.125
Every cop in this city's looking for him,
not to mention the fucking beaners.

525
00:50:24.286 --> 00:50:25.884
- The fucking Orientals.
- So?

526
00:50:26.046 --> 00:50:28.245
So? So?
So the heat's on the street...

527
00:50:28.406 --> 00:50:30.285
...and that dude's
playing for keeps, baby.

528
00:50:30.446 --> 00:50:32.605
I have no idea
what the hell you just said.

529
00:50:32.766 --> 00:50:34.685
- Look. Lemon. Lemon, look.
- What?

530
00:50:34.846 --> 00:50:38.245
I know we've all been down our
dark roads in the past, okay, babe?

531
00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:42.646
I need my hair did, my nails did.
You ain't gave me no money.

532
00:50:42.807 --> 00:50:44.406
Where you been at, Randy?

533
00:50:44.567 --> 00:50:46.446
If I ever catch you with another bitch...

534
00:50:46.607 --> 00:50:48.767
Well, you do got a big-ass dick
for a white boy.

535
00:50:51.527 --> 00:50:55.126
Anyway, look, the point is,
you're my lady now, all right?

536
00:50:55.288 --> 00:50:57.887
I don't think it's safe
for you to be out there with that-

537
00:50:58.048 --> 00:51:00.927
That sick fucko running wild right now.

538
00:51:01.088 --> 00:51:02.687
- You can say that again.
- Look, look.

539
00:51:02.848 --> 00:51:05.047
Listen to me.
Here's what I think we should do.

540
00:51:05.209 --> 00:51:07.887
- What, Randy?
- All right, I say we go to the fuzz.

541
00:51:08.048 --> 00:51:09.728
We tell them everything.
We come clean.

542
00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:11.687
- What?
- The fuzz, all right?

543
00:51:11.848 --> 00:51:15.008
I mean, I'd kill this guy myself,
but I got two strikes against me.

544
00:51:15.689 --> 00:51:17.048
- Let go of me.
- Look, baby.

545
00:51:17.209 --> 00:51:20.449
All right? I'm trying to be cool to you,
but I will drop the hammer.

546
00:51:20.609 --> 00:51:22.528
You want me to drop the hammer,
baby?

547
00:51:30.209 --> 00:51:32.689
I'm in no mood today, Randy!

548
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.649
Lemon!

549
00:51:50.011 --> 00:51:51.650
Freeze!

550
00:51:51.811 --> 00:51:52.811
Hey!

551
00:51:52.971 --> 00:51:54.530
Now, spread it.

552
00:51:55.972 --> 00:51:57.731
All right, let's go.

553
00:52:00.052 --> 00:52:01.731
Against the car.

554
00:52:26.493 --> 00:52:27.972
Don't leave no skid marks, nigga.

555
00:52:29.653 --> 00:52:32.212
- Work that ass, baby.
- Ride that shit, big sexy!

556
00:52:32.373 --> 00:52:33.413
Put your arm up, son.

557
00:52:33.573 --> 00:52:35.293
Eight seconds, nigga! Yeah.

558
00:52:35.454 --> 00:52:37.253
Oh, my God.

559
00:52:37.414 --> 00:52:38.853
- Hello.
- Orlando?

560
00:52:39.014 --> 00:52:41.653
Venus! What is up, my man?

561
00:52:41.814 --> 00:52:43.974
Where you been, man?
I ain't seen your ass since-

562
00:52:44.134 --> 00:52:47.573
We was all of us broken up about what
happened to your brother. You okay?

563
00:52:47.734 --> 00:52:49.654
- Orlando, I need your help.
- Venus, come on.

564
00:52:49.815 --> 00:52:51.334
You my nigga. Can't get no bigger.

565
00:52:51.495 --> 00:52:53.774
L.A. Underground,
we're like a family, man.

566
00:52:53.935 --> 00:52:56.094
We a freak-ass family,
but we family, all right?

567
00:52:56.255 --> 00:52:59.894
- We look out for our own. What?
- I'm looking for a man called The Ferret.

568
00:53:00.055 --> 00:53:02.014
El Huron.

569
00:53:02.655 --> 00:53:04.014
Shit.

570
00:53:04.175 --> 00:53:05.615
Ferret?

571
00:53:12.936 --> 00:53:13.895
Oh, great.

572
00:53:17.297 --> 00:53:19.296
Hydrated, man! Keep him hydrated!

573
00:53:19.457 --> 00:53:22.056
- Step on it!
- Hold it in. Hold it in. Hold it in.

574
00:53:23.896 --> 00:53:25.216
Fuck.

575
00:53:25.377 --> 00:53:27.016
This is an ambulance, you fuckhead!

576
00:53:29.497 --> 00:53:31.017
Keep hydrating those organs!

577
00:53:31.177 --> 00:53:32.616
- Hold it in!
- Jesus.

578
00:53:32.778 --> 00:53:34.537
What are you doing?
This is an ambulance!

579
00:53:34.698 --> 00:53:38.217
Right, motherfucker. I'm aware of that.
I'm in need of emergency services.

580
00:53:38.378 --> 00:53:40.697
Yeah, we have got a guy
in the back of the ambulance!

581
00:53:40.858 --> 00:53:42.177
Get him out of here, man.

582
00:53:42.338 --> 00:53:45.337
- That's one of Don Kim's blokes.
- This man is in critical condition.

583
00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:47.137
- Get out of here.
- I'm aware of that.

584
00:53:47.298 --> 00:53:48.818
I'm the fucker that put him there.

585
00:53:48.979 --> 00:53:50.977
- Now...
- Okay, he's got a gun!

586
00:53:51.738 --> 00:53:52.938
- You're my physician.
- Okay.

587
00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:55.978
I'm in need of an external lithium
battery belt...

588
00:53:56.138 --> 00:53:59.178
...for an Avicor Total Artificial Heart.

589
00:53:59.339 --> 00:54:01.898
- Might you have such a thing?
- We're gonna lose it, Bronc.

590
00:54:02.059 --> 00:54:05.419
- Please, look, this guy is fucking dying.
- Don't worry about him.

591
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:07.339
He's not gonna make it.

592
00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:12.019
- Now, about my battery.
- Yeah, you said the Avicor TAH.

593
00:54:12.179 --> 00:54:13.818
Yeah, we got it. But why?

594
00:54:18.061 --> 00:54:19.499
- Holy shit.
- Chop, chop.

595
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.579
Okay.

596
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.620
- He's fucking dead, man.
- Do you mind?

597
00:54:34.061 --> 00:54:35.860
- You ready for this shit?
- Do it then.

598
00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:37.180
Turn the fucking thing on.

599
00:54:43.502 --> 00:54:46.781
Feels like crack.

600
00:54:46.942 --> 00:54:47.941
Yeah, but better.

601
00:54:48.102 --> 00:54:50.861
You know, those things
aren't designed for strenuous activity.

602
00:54:51.022 --> 00:54:52.902
Tell me about it.

603
00:54:58.503 --> 00:55:01.382
- Stop the fucking ambulance!
- Dude, we got to go to the hospital.

604
00:55:01.543 --> 00:55:02.822
Fuck!

605
00:55:12.543 --> 00:55:14.462
Bing fucking Crosby.

606
00:55:18.224 --> 00:55:21.143
Breathe out. Raise your buttocks
upward by first walking-

607
00:55:21.304 --> 00:55:22.983
Come on, down with that doggie.

608
00:55:23.144 --> 00:55:24.943
Down dog-

609
00:55:25.104 --> 00:55:26.783
- Hello.
- Doc, I'm close.

610
00:55:26.944 --> 00:55:28.703
So am I.
Chev, can this wait a second?

611
00:55:28.864 --> 00:55:31.583
I think I've found that motherfucker
that's got my organ.

612
00:55:31.744 --> 00:55:35.104
I think I got the skinny on that Triad
geezer from my girls on the street.

613
00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.584
Old news. I'll get back to you
when I have the tart.

614
00:55:37.745 --> 00:55:39.504
Chevy, wait!

615
00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:48.625
Chev Chelios!

616
00:56:00.467 --> 00:56:02.065
Fucking clowns.

617
00:56:29.108 --> 00:56:30.548
Cunt!

618
00:56:33.068 --> 00:56:35.387
It's completely normal
to be freaked out...

619
00:56:35.548 --> 00:56:37.268
...when someone has a gun
at your head.

620
00:56:37.428 --> 00:56:40.068
- I would have shit myself.
- I still have nightmares.

621
00:56:40.229 --> 00:56:41.988
Everybody has nightmares.

622
00:56:42.149 --> 00:56:45.068
The point is, by coming here
and talking with me...

623
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:49.589
...you made a choice
to confront your issues and lick them.

624
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.669
I can't even leave
my fucking apartment. I-

625
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:55.829
Every time I go up to leave the door,
I see the guy with the gun.

626
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:57.989
- I'm having a really bad day.
- Oh, shit.

627
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.829
Tell me you got epinephrine
in this fucking cart.

628
00:57:00.991 --> 00:57:02.910
Think about it like this, Engleson.

629
00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.470
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

630
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:08.790
You gotta go out and enjoy it.

631
00:57:08.951 --> 00:57:12.310
Knock back a couple of beers,
hit a titty bar.

632
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:15.830
- Excuse me?
- Have some smelly snatch rubbed...

633
00:57:15.991 --> 00:57:18.150
...in your face.
You gotta get out there, man.

634
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:20.191
Yeah. I've gotta do it.

635
00:57:20.831 --> 00:57:22.391
I'm gonna go and tackle the world.

636
00:57:22.551 --> 00:57:24.311
No, don't tackle the world.

637
00:57:24.471 --> 00:57:26.790
Tackle a fucking whore.
Get your dick wet.

638
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:30.031
- Yeah.
- Dip your wick into life a little bit.

639
00:57:30.192 --> 00:57:32.751
- Have some fun.
- Yeah.

640
00:57:32.912 --> 00:57:35.991
I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna
floss my teeth with some pubes.

641
00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:38.191
- Oh, now you're on it.
- Thanks, doctor.

642
00:57:38.352 --> 00:57:40.592
- Oh, my pleasure.
- No, no, no.

643
00:57:40.753 --> 00:57:42.872
The pleasure's all mine.

644
00:57:43.033 --> 00:57:44.512
I'm done with fear.

645
00:57:44.673 --> 00:57:46.792
My life begins today.

646
00:57:57.434 --> 00:57:59.273
Fuck!

647
01:00:20.082 --> 01:00:22.002
Hey, maybe we better call 911.

648
01:00:30.403 --> 01:00:32.322
Where's my box?

649
01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:53.284
Five more like that, and your brains
will be strawberry jelly.

650
01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:56.243
You can't look in that box!

651
01:00:56.404 --> 01:00:58.724
The key and the fucking combo.

652
01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:00.164
No!

653
01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:01.684
Do it.

654
01:01:10.685 --> 01:01:12.004
That's better.

655
01:01:20.046 --> 01:01:22.365
This isn't my fucking pumper!

656
01:01:25.287 --> 01:01:26.805
What is that?

657
01:01:27.847 --> 01:01:30.886
What kind of sick freak carries
something like this around in a box?

658
01:01:33.567 --> 01:01:35.646
I am shocked to my fucking core.

659
01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:38.406
You've got some deep problems,
motherfucker.

660
01:01:41.927 --> 01:01:43.126
What the fuck is that?

661
01:01:55.008 --> 01:01:57.447
Fucking gotta come back
and fucking gotta find out...

662
01:01:57.608 --> 01:01:58.888
...what the fuck is this?

663
01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.808
What the fuck is-?

664
01:02:02.129 --> 01:02:03.447
- Hello.
- Doc.

665
01:02:03.609 --> 01:02:06.888
When you hung up on me, I was trying
to fucking tell you something.

666
01:02:07.049 --> 01:02:08.968
Your heart was transplanted
three weeks ago...

667
01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:10.568
...into that Shaolin motherfucker.

668
01:02:10.729 --> 01:02:13.608
- Fucking great. Now what?
- I'm on it.

669
01:02:13.769 --> 01:02:15.928
Poon Dong is still in L.A.
And if I'm right...

670
01:02:16.089 --> 01:02:18.729
...he's got what you need in pristine,
working condition...

671
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:20.129
...beating inside his chest.

672
01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:22.729
- Good. Where do I find him?
- Don't worry about it.

673
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.169
I got people on the street.

674
01:02:39.411 --> 01:02:42.371
Good luck with that, Doc.
I'll try it my way.

675
01:02:43.371 --> 01:02:44.770
Come here, you.

676
01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:46.250
Up you get.

677
01:02:47.132 --> 01:02:50.851
Okay, darling, one last dance.

678
01:02:51.291 --> 01:02:52.571
Where's the fucking old man?

679
01:03:06.573 --> 01:03:07.692
What old man?

680
01:03:14.853 --> 01:03:18.573
Hey. Hey. I got 5 dollars
that says you blow me for 20 bucks.

681
01:03:26.494 --> 01:03:29.133
Oh, stop. Stop right here.
Stop right here.

682
01:03:29.294 --> 01:03:30.653
Hey, baby.

683
01:03:30.814 --> 01:03:32.173
Hey.

684
01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:35.733
- Hey, baby. How you doing?
- I'm doing okay, baby.

685
01:03:35.894 --> 01:03:37.054
- Yeah?
- How you doing?

686
01:03:37.215 --> 01:03:38.414
What you need?

687
01:03:40.215 --> 01:03:41.614
You know what I need.

688
01:03:43.215 --> 01:03:45.454
Come on. Come on, Daddy.

689
01:03:51.415 --> 01:03:52.654
Fuck you, Chelios.

690
01:04:12.177 --> 01:04:14.536
Tell me what he's like
when he's at home.

691
01:04:14.696 --> 01:04:16.936
When he's home, he's like a ghost.

692
01:04:17.097 --> 01:04:19.856
He just plays those video games
all day, all night.

693
01:04:20.617 --> 01:04:22.096
- Video games?
- All day.

694
01:04:22.257 --> 01:04:23.376
And you let him do that?

695
01:04:24.658 --> 01:04:28.256
I mean, you did buy the games
for him, yeah?

696
01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:29.657
Of course.

697
01:04:29.818 --> 01:04:31.657
Why should I deny my son?

698
01:04:31.818 --> 01:04:34.617
- How are you today, Chev?
- I'm golden, sir.

699
01:04:34.778 --> 01:04:38.417
Your mom tells me that you've
been getting into quite a bit of trouble.

700
01:04:38.578 --> 01:04:40.578
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

701
01:04:40.738 --> 01:04:43.777
- Regretfully, that's true.
- What kind of trouble?

702
01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:48.138
Fighting, talking back, pinching.

703
01:04:48.299 --> 01:04:49.458
Pinching what?

704
01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:53.298
Televisions, stereo components,
books from the library.

705
01:04:53.459 --> 01:04:55.698
- That's not all.
- No, sir.

706
01:04:55.859 --> 01:04:58.699
Also a till from a restaurant
and one car.

707
01:04:58.859 --> 01:05:01.099
- A toy car?
- No, sir.

708
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.698
A BMW Z1.

709
01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.179
Hey, sit.

710
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.259
People, people, all right.

711
01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.659
I hear you've been having
quite a bit of trouble at school too.

712
01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:18.220
Chelios.

713
01:05:23.581 --> 01:05:25.581
Nothing I can't handle, sir.

714
01:05:26.101 --> 01:05:28.421
- I have a lot of piss and vinegar.
- He's hyperactive.

715
01:05:28.582 --> 01:05:29.580
Oh, shit, Mom.

716
01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:31.780
You want to watch your
dirty little mouth, son.

717
01:05:31.941 --> 01:05:34.021
- We tried giving him Ritalin, but-
- Chev?

718
01:05:34.902 --> 01:05:35.861
I sold it.

719
01:05:36.021 --> 01:05:38.381
With all this energy,
you've never thought about...

720
01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:40.461
...I don't know, trying out for sports?

721
01:05:53.063 --> 01:05:56.023
- I like to run.
- Chev, where's Dad?

722
01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:59.583
I never met the wanker.
He died before I was born.

723
01:05:59.743 --> 01:06:04.022
What do you think he'd say
if he saw you acting out like this?

724
01:06:04.184 --> 01:06:05.222
Don't know, sir.

725
01:06:05.383 --> 01:06:08.663
If he were here now,
and he asked you:

726
01:06:08.824 --> 01:06:11.703
"Why the bloody hell
do you do the things you do, son?"

727
01:06:11.864 --> 01:06:14.583
- What would you tell him?
- Don't know, sir.

728
01:06:14.744 --> 01:06:16.984
- Bored, I guess.
- Bored, he guesses.

729
01:06:17.145 --> 01:06:19.064
- Bored? Bored?
- Shut up.

730
01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:20.944
We're gonna take a short break now.

731
01:06:21.105 --> 01:06:23.624
And when we return,
we are gonna find out...

732
01:06:24.984 --> 01:06:29.144
...what makes you tick, little man.

733
01:07:00.987 --> 01:07:02.106
Hey.

734
01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.506
You okay? Wake up.

735
01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.266
Wake up.

736
01:07:23.629 --> 01:07:25.467
Ria, baby.

737
01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.508
What happened to you?

738
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:33.908
What are you doing out here?

739
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.709
What you out here for?

740
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:44.909
I'm looking for the man
that killed my brother.

741
01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.509
Yeah.

742
01:08:00.831 --> 01:08:02.510
I have to go.

743
01:08:03.151 --> 01:08:05.270
I might not come back.

744
01:08:05.431 --> 01:08:07.230
Give the girls kisses
and hugs from me.

745
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:10.711
I kiss and hug all the pussy.
You go kill cocksucker.

746
01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.631
Some boyfriend you got there,
Ms. Lydon.

747
01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.991
He lied to you
for six months regarding his work?

748
01:08:29.152 --> 01:08:33.312
Which I guess wouldn't be such
a big deal if he wasn't a hired killer.

749
01:08:33.473 --> 01:08:36.072
He made you a target
for the South American mob...

750
01:08:36.233 --> 01:08:38.592
...for kidnapping, torture, or worse.

751
01:08:38.753 --> 01:08:41.273
He sexually humiliated you
in front of what...

752
01:08:41.434 --> 01:08:43.152
...I don't know, half of Los Angeles?

753
01:08:43.314 --> 01:08:44.833
Twice.

754
01:08:44.994 --> 01:08:48.032
Twice. And then left you there
to take the rap?

755
01:08:48.193 --> 01:08:50.553
And now you can add an arrest
and a police record...

756
01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:54.033
...to a list of wonderful things
Mr. Chelios has brought to your life.

757
01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.273
Help me out here, sweetheart, okay?

758
01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:01.353
Because-
Because I'm a little bit confused.

759
01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:07.794
Why the fuck do you continue
to protect this asshole?

760
01:09:10.115 --> 01:09:12.754
That's a dicky question.

761
01:09:13.755 --> 01:09:15.874
Besides, I don't know
who you're talking about.

762
01:09:17.476 --> 01:09:20.995
I mean, I'd like to see you fall
out of a helicopter and live.

763
01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.594
What?

764
01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:39.716
It looks like you made bail.

765
01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:42.276
- Great. Can I have my stuff back?
- Yeah.

766
01:09:42.437 --> 01:09:44.797
Yeah. Just a-
Just one little piece of advice.

767
01:09:44.957 --> 01:09:49.277
Wake the fuck up
and smell what's burning.

768
01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.279
Fuck.

769
01:10:38.121 --> 01:10:39.959
Hola, Chev.

770
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:44.480
I take it you're the greasy fucker
that's been hunting me all day.

771
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:45.640
The Ferret.

772
01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:47.920
Some people know me
by this fucking name.

773
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.961
And many men have died
cursing the name of El Huron...

774
01:10:52.402 --> 01:10:55.521
...as they choked on their own blood,
and the blood of their families.

775
01:10:55.682 --> 01:10:57.281
Colorful geezer.

776
01:10:58.402 --> 01:11:01.361
I was born with another name.

777
01:11:02.242 --> 01:11:03.721
The name of my father.

778
01:11:06.042 --> 01:11:08.121
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fucking hell.

779
01:11:10.722 --> 01:11:12.201
And my father's father's.

780
01:11:12.362 --> 01:11:13.762
We're all very sad.

781
01:11:13.923 --> 01:11:16.002
And the name...

782
01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:18.682
...that I share...

783
01:11:18.843 --> 01:11:21.082
...with my two brothers...

784
01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:23.282
...Alejandro...

785
01:11:27.204 --> 01:11:28.922
...Ricardo...

786
01:11:34.564 --> 01:11:36.283
Verona.

787
01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:42.403
Oh, I can tell, while I dig, dig, dig...

788
01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:47.084
...that you had no idea
that there was a third brother.

789
01:11:47.245 --> 01:11:50.644
Nope. That fact escaped me.

790
01:11:50.805 --> 01:11:53.804
What I assure you of, is I would have
made it a fucking hat trick.

791
01:11:53.965 --> 01:11:56.325
I got a trick or three for you, cabron.

792
01:11:56.485 --> 01:12:00.204
I'm gonna make you wish
that you was never a man.

793
01:12:00.365 --> 01:12:02.364
If you want to kill me,
you get on with it.

794
01:12:02.525 --> 01:12:04.284
What's the rush, Chelios?

795
01:12:05.206 --> 01:12:09.205
I know someone
who's going to love to watch this.

796
01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:39.727
You.

797
01:12:57.169 --> 01:13:00.928
- You got the donor?
- Like you got a boner.

798
01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:02.848
Hey, baby.

799
01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:05.969
You always say you want
to be more spontaneous.

800
01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.569
Cowboy.

801
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:09.689
We gonna go back to my place.

802
01:13:09.849 --> 01:13:11.569
- Yeah.
- That sounds good.

803
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:15.849
Ricardo never wanted
my money, Chelios.

804
01:13:16.011 --> 01:13:17.930
He was too stubborn.

805
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.289
Wanted to make his own way.

806
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:24.770
Now I think he likes
what my money can buy.

807
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:28.210
The technology to keep his brain alive.

808
01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:30.130
Not forever.

809
01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:33.411
But long enough to watch you die.

810
01:13:56.053 --> 01:13:57.932
Yo, Ferret. This ain't Roots, man.

811
01:13:58.093 --> 01:13:59.732
Yeah?

812
01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:01.652
Hey, cabron.

813
01:14:04.133 --> 01:14:06.453
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

814
01:14:06.614 --> 01:14:09.173
You killed my brother, motherfucker.
Prepare to die.

815
01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.975
Fuck you, Chelios.

816
01:15:37.259 --> 01:15:39.098
This way, sugar.

817
01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:47.819
Confucius say, "Karma's a bitch. "

818
01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.140
Hello, Ricky.

819
01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:10.500
Why do we go on like this, Ricky?

820
01:16:10.661 --> 01:16:12.260
Hurting each other.

821
01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:15.740
Water?

822
01:16:16.141 --> 01:16:18.101
Did you say water?

823
01:16:23.222 --> 01:16:24.981
H20?

824
01:16:25.142 --> 01:16:26.621
Coming right up.

825
01:18:42.271 --> 01:18:46.960
Chev Chelios. Chev.

826
01:18:56.711 --> 01:18:57.990
Chev.

827
01:18:58.151 --> 01:19:00.231
Chev. Chev!

828
01:20:50.238 --> 01:20:51.957
Cut the battery.

829
01:20:52.118 --> 01:20:53.798
Battery's out.

830
01:21:32.481 --> 01:21:33.760
Paddles. Give me the paddles.

831
01:21:33.921 --> 01:21:34.960
What's going on?

832
01:21:39.082 --> 01:21:40.721
Chevy? Clear!

833
01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.440
Fuck!

834
01:21:47.522 --> 01:21:51.521
- Shit!
- No! God! No.

835
01:22:45.205 --> 01:22:46.965
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

836
01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:48.924
What the fuck?

837
01:22:50.405 --> 01:22:51.924
Jesus.

838
01:22:54.166 --> 01:22:56.485
It's so hard to keep a straight face.

839
01:22:56.646 --> 01:22:57.845
Sorry, Ches.

840
01:23:43.129 --> 01:23:44.728
Stay on the marker!

841
01:23:44.889 --> 01:23:46.648
- Let's go.
- Body parts ready?

842
01:23:46.809 --> 01:23:49.488
- Yes.
- All right.

843
01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:50.648
Here we go!

844
01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:52.489
- And- You set there?
- Ready?

845
01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:55.089
And action, Mike!

846
01:23:58.329 --> 01:23:59.969
Andrew!

847
01:24:10.010 --> 01:24:12.729
Go! Go, Lance! Run, Lance!

848
01:24:38.772 --> 01:24:39.812
Action, Manny!

849
01:24:39.973 --> 01:24:42.412
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

850
01:24:42.573 --> 01:24:44.131
You think these muscles are free?

851
01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:46.212
You think this cock's for free?

852
01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:49.372
No way! No scabs, no crabs!

853
01:24:49.533 --> 01:24:51.612
No scabs, no crabs!

854
01:24:51.773 --> 01:24:54.012
I'm gonna bang that bitch
in the back!

855
01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:56.492
I'm gonna bang your prisoner!

856
01:24:56.653 --> 01:24:59.693
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

857
01:25:00.254 --> 01:25:02.293
Look at Jason and say it.

858
01:25:02.454 --> 01:25:04.573
Dropping loads
all over your prisoner!

859
01:25:04.734 --> 01:25:07.453
Dropping loads
all over your silly wages!

860
01:25:07.614 --> 01:25:09.653
Yeah! Yeah!

861
01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:11.413
Fuck you!

862
01:26:11.578 --> 01:26:14.177
I take it you're the faggot
that's been hunting me all day?

863
01:26:14.338 --> 01:26:15.298
No.

864
01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:16.938
The faggot.

865
01:26:17.098 --> 01:26:18.657
The faggot. Oh, sorry. The Ferret.

866
01:27:14.342 --> 01:27:17.141
No dough, no blow!
No dough, no blow!

867
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:19.781
Dicks like this don't come for free!

868
01:27:20.222 --> 01:27:21.861
Lips like this don't come for free.

869
01:27:22.022 --> 01:27:24.102
That's what I meant to say.

870
01:27:24.663 --> 01:27:27.302
I meant lips like this
don't come for free.

871
01:27:27.462 --> 01:27:28.782
All right, keep going.

872
01:28:27.787 --> 01:28:29.745
Oh, a horse.

873
01:28:30.227 --> 01:28:31.665
What?

874
01:28:33.787 --> 01:28:36.585
I never had it that way before.

875
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:27.829
- Let us kiss for a second.
- Okay.

876
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:29.789
Yeah.

877
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:33.070
And here we go. And action!

878
01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:14.752
Water.

879
01:30:14.912 --> 01:30:17.352
Fuck, you need a few mints.

880
01:31:11.436 --> 01:31:13.635
- Holy shit.
- Unbelievable.

881
01:31:13.796 --> 01:31:16.876
- Yeah.
- Holy shit. Fuck.

882
01:31:17.037 --> 01:31:18.796
That was fucking awesome.

883
01:31:18.957 --> 01:31:21.116
- Let's cradle the balls on that.
- Good job, buddy.

884
01:31:21.277 --> 01:31:23.116
- I'm sure we got it.
- You good?

885
01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:24.396
- Yeah.
- Good job, brother.

886
01:31:24.557 --> 01:31:26.357
- You okay?
- Yeah.

887
01:31:26.517 --> 01:31:28.557
Fuck, that was hot.
