"FLYING SAUCERS" FOUND

4
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.904
Damn it, Ricky, answer.

5
00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.083
Hey, Ricky, listen, it's Terry.

6
00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:35.476
Listen, they're on to me.

7
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.695
Okay, I'm leaving the backpack
at the Hook and Ladder,

8
00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.350
the place that we
met last, okay?

9
00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.398
You got five to 10 minutes,
you gotta come quick.

10
00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:54.234
Don't worry.

11
00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:56.453
He'll be here any minute.

12
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.120
Can't believe that
cop betrayed us, man.

13
00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:12.252
Fucking cunt.

14
00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:14.689
Yeah, sad waste of pussy.

15
00:04:14.732 --> 00:04:16.255
Good pussy that is.

16
00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:19.346
Yeah, brother.

17
00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:23.263
Nah, nah.

18
00:04:23.306 --> 00:04:25.134
It makes sense, man.

19
00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.268
Makes sense
about what, Monroe?

20
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.052
How she played us.

21
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.012
We're gonna get her back.

22
00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:35.405
Damn sure we'll get her back.

23
00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.016
Every dog has its day.

24
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.627
Especially a bitch like her.

25
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.324
Know that.

26
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:44.240
All right, all
right, can't wait.

27
00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:57.645
Well, let me ask you, are you
sure you can handle yourself?

28
00:04:57.688 --> 00:04:59.516
You don't need me
or nothing, right?

29
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.866
Monroe, I can handle this.

30
00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:21.495
What do I do now?

31
00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:30.155
Okay, all right,
whatever you say.

32
00:05:41.384 --> 00:05:42.385
This is insane.

33
00:05:44.692 --> 00:05:45.475
Fuck you.

34
00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:56.486
It ends here.

35
00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:58.575
No.

36
00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:12.459
Hand the bag over.

37
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:17.507
Over my dead body.

38
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:20.597
Okay, if that's
how you want it.

39
00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:23.774
Why don't you call the police?

40
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:51.411
Up.

41
00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:53.238
Fuck that.

42
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:01.246
He got away.

43
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:06.600
He won't get far,
this I assure you.

44
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:13.563
You underestimated this.

45
00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.391
I know what happened.

46
00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.698
Seemed to be our
best bet at this point.

47
00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:18.916
What's our timeframe?

48
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.528
We have a 24-hour window.

49
00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:23.312
And that we can't lose.

50
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:26.533
I don't understand.

51
00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:28.665
I'll explain
everything to you later.

52
00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:30.362
Right now I gotta
make a phone call.

53
00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:32.234
See what we can get on this.

54
00:07:32.277 --> 00:07:34.889
The only people in this
circle that we can trust.

55
00:07:37.369 --> 00:07:40.547
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

56
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.591
Agreed.

57
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:45.552
Fuck.

58
00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:03.004
Yes, I know, my
legs are killing me.

59
00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:04.701
There are only two
people I trust.

60
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.532
Yes, there is.

61
00:08:13.188 --> 00:08:13.971
I promise.

62
00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:35.515
I am one with myself.

63
00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:37.125
I am a force of one.

64
00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:39.693
I am one with myself.

65
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.347
I am a force of one.

66
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:48.440
I am a force of one.

67
00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:50.138
I am one with myself.

68
00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:02.716
Goddammit, who the hell's
knocking on the fucking door

69
00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:05.153
while I'm trying to goddamn
meditate, motherfucker?

70
00:09:07.764 --> 00:09:11.159
Yo, Al, you always fucking
up my meditation, man.

71
00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:11.986
Oh my god.

72
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.597
What can I do for you today?

73
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:17.295
I need you to
do a favor for me.

74
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:19.820
I need you to pick .

75
00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:22.170
All right, man, what do
you want, you son of a prick?

76
00:09:22.213 --> 00:09:24.346
I need you to pick up
that thing for me .

77
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:25.782
Is it at the same spot?

78
00:09:25.826 --> 00:09:27.479
Yeah, he dropped the box
same spot all the time.

79
00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:29.612
As always?
As always.

80
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:32.006
Oh my god.

81
00:09:32.049 --> 00:09:34.661
Yo, you looked stress, baby,
you need some pussy, Dave.

82
00:09:34.704 --> 00:09:36.271
What's up?

83
00:09:36.314 --> 00:09:37.489
Dog, you know she's been
gone three years, man,

84
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:38.273
you know that.

85
00:09:38.316 --> 00:09:39.187
Three years?

86
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.797
That's a long time, man.

87
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.103
Yeah, three years, man.

88
00:09:42.146 --> 00:09:43.365
Yo, I always got
somebody for you, B.

89
00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:45.062
You gotta come out
with me one time, man.

90
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.586
I'm not a whore like
you, I don't do that.

91
00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:48.588
I need to center myself
with inner peace.

92
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:50.198
You know what I'm saying?
Said a piece.

93
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:51.503
Inner peace, inner peace.

94
00:09:51.547 --> 00:09:53.201
Inner peace, you gotta
get it together, man.

95
00:09:53.244 --> 00:09:54.724
Come out with me one time, man.

96
00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:57.205
Oh my, all right,
look man, let me,

97
00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.510
you got an hour or two.

98
00:09:58.554 --> 00:09:59.773
Like I said, if you
want, crash here.

99
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.993
Like always and
fucking, you know,

100
00:10:03.037 --> 00:10:05.735
I'll just go handle
that for you, all right?

101
00:10:05.779 --> 00:10:06.867
I bet.

102
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.216
Yo, I'm hungry as a
motherfucker, man.

103
00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:09.783
You got some food in
the fridge, what's up?

104
00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:11.654
Your big ass always
fucking hungry.

105
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:12.612
You know where the
fucking fridge is at,

106
00:10:12.655 --> 00:10:13.351
go help yourself, man.

107
00:10:13.395 --> 00:10:14.439
Got ya, man.

108
00:10:14.483 --> 00:10:15.310
You're lucky I love you, man.

109
00:10:15.353 --> 00:10:16.833
Shit, love you too, man.

110
00:10:16.877 --> 00:10:17.617
Fuck.

111
00:10:19.793 --> 00:10:21.142
Ay-yi-yi.

112
00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:24.754
I love my boss, but I
can't stand him sometimes.

113
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:43.730
Monroe, what the
hell's wrong with-

114
00:10:43.773 --> 00:10:44.774
Shut up, nigga.

115
00:10:47.734 --> 00:10:49.779
You can run but you
can't hide, bitch.

116
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:15.196
Goddammit, goddamn door.

117
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:17.546
Every time, fucking.

118
00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.157
Damn it, every time
I'm trying to fucking.

119
00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:24.553
Who is it?

120
00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:25.728
Jay, help me.

121
00:11:25.772 --> 00:11:27.295
You all right, man?

122
00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:29.732
Yeah.
Hold on, hold on.

123
00:11:29.776 --> 00:11:31.821
It's hard to explain, man.

124
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:35.651
Sit on the couch, sit
on the couch, come on.

125
00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:40.090
Be careful.

126
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.096
What the hell happened man?

127
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.576
Its hard to explain
I was being chased.

128
00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:49.839
Who were you being chased by?

129
00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:51.536
You gotta listen.

130
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.103
Who, who you talkin' to?

131
00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:55.018
I'm right here.

132
00:11:55.062 --> 00:11:58.369
I told you stop
smoking that shit right.

133
00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:00.458
C'mon you know I
don't like that stuff

134
00:12:00.502 --> 00:12:01.764
I'm right here who
the hell you talking to?

135
00:12:01.808 --> 00:12:04.985
Tell me what happened.
Who was chasing you?

136
00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:09.903
What do you mean?
Find out what?

137
00:12:11.556 --> 00:12:12.427
Just relax.

138
00:12:13.384 --> 00:12:14.124
I'm calm, I'm calm brother.

139
00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:15.038
Stay calm.

140
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:16.561
Just tell me what's going on.

141
00:12:23.873 --> 00:12:24.874
Now stay calm

142
00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:25.701
I am calm.

143
00:12:38.322 --> 00:12:40.760
What the fuck is that Rick?

144
00:12:42.979 --> 00:12:45.112
Nah, that can't be real man.

145
00:12:50.944 --> 00:12:53.381
What the fuck is that Rick?

146
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:58.125
Nah that can't be real man.

147
00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:02.346
You have to stick your
fingers into the jar.

148
00:13:05.045 --> 00:13:05.610
Say what now?

149
00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:09.832
You want me to stick my
fingers in the fucking fluid?

150
00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.660
Are you fucking serious Rick?

151
00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:15.882
You really have to trust me.

152
00:13:15.925 --> 00:13:17.622
Are you fucking serious?

153
00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:23.063
You're my brother.

154
00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:23.846
And I love you, man.

155
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:32.899
Don't hurt it.

156
00:13:36.076 --> 00:13:37.207
I'll be careful.

157
00:13:38.992 --> 00:13:40.210
Then he got a brief headache.

158
00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:42.343
It's only the last few
seconds. I promise.

159
00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:54.834
How you feeling?

160
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.183
How'm I feeling?

161
00:13:58.707 --> 00:14:00.100
I don't feel nothing man.

162
00:14:00.143 --> 00:14:02.319
Everything is copacetic, right?

163
00:14:58.027 --> 00:15:00.812
Christ. They get the
voices in my head, man.

164
00:15:00.856 --> 00:15:02.858
What the fuck is this?

165
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.122
This is crazy.

166
00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:13.216
This man, I need a drink please.

167
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.458
I'm going go do a job.

168
00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:44.595
Okay. I'll be back on
an hour to come back.

169
00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:47.337
When I come back
we'll talk about all.

170
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:48.382
Figure something out.

171
00:15:57.608 --> 00:16:01.482
I take a shower to take
them with me to be safe.

172
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.842
Take him with you.

173
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:15.670
Now I have to take
him with me too?

174
00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:19.587
You're gonna be safe,
he's gonna protect you.

175
00:16:25.462 --> 00:16:29.075
Please I need
you. We need you.

176
00:16:29.118 --> 00:16:31.251
All right give me the bag.

177
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.088
Just relax.

178
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:42.958
Just relax.

179
00:16:54.317 --> 00:16:59.018
The things I do for you.
You're lucky I love you.

180
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:08.810
hello? Why are you smelling?

181
00:17:08.853 --> 00:17:09.984
The hormones?

182
00:17:12.596 --> 00:17:14.990
Hormones is right enlightenment.

183
00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:15.772
One second.

184
00:17:15.817 --> 00:17:17.036
What happened?

185
00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:23.172
Pheromones is a certain chemical
that all living things give

186
00:17:23.215 --> 00:17:26.567
off due to stress,
different behaviors.

187
00:17:28.308 --> 00:17:30.049
Dr. Silva gave me these guests

188
00:17:32.138 --> 00:17:36.098
so I could be tagged
with these pheromones.

189
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.148
You see, there's a reason
why he gave me these gifts

190
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:49.329
and no gifts to you.
I'm his number one

191
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:52.941
And you're his number two.

192
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:02.516
Let's go.

193
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.973
Take a shower. Take a shower.

194
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.441
Where are we going?

195
00:18:58.485 --> 00:18:59.747
I'm getting bad feelings.

196
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.704
What do you mean?

197
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:02.097
You're getting a bad feeling.

198
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.143
Something is not right.

199
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:06.014
I've started to
understand this more

200
00:19:06.057 --> 00:19:08.190
and more as I heal enough.

201
00:19:08.234 --> 00:19:08.973
All right.

202
00:19:09.017 --> 00:19:09.931
I'll tell you what.

203
00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:11.193
Just let me handle my business.

204
00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:12.499
I got to go do a job.

205
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:13.804
Let me handle my business.

206
00:19:13.848 --> 00:19:15.415
And then I have to get
you a distraction point.

207
00:19:15.458 --> 00:19:19.027
Alright. By the way, you never
told me how you got here.

208
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.203
Oh, short down for years.

209
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:24.075
We have to turn to make contacts

210
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:27.470
but everyone we've come across
to try to make us a study

211
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:30.299
of some sort of
worse, wrong test.

212
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:31.213
Wow.

213
00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:32.649
That's logic.

214
00:19:32.693 --> 00:19:33.911
I mean, that's logical.

215
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:36.000
I mean, I could
see that happening.

216
00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:38.046
Like I'm sorry to
hear about that, man.

217
00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:41.310
I mean, nobody deserves
that, but like I said

218
00:19:41.354 --> 00:19:42.093
I'm gonna help you get home.

219
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:43.356
I promise.

220
00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:46.185
Okay. I mean, this
is crazy woman

221
00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:48.665
in his brainy woman
is nice outside.

222
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.145
I mean, Jesus Christ.

223
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.713
Like is you messing
with the weather?

224
00:19:52.756 --> 00:19:54.497
Hey, I know what its you.

225
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:55.281
Tell me that.

226
00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:56.717
It's you, right?

227
00:19:58.371 --> 00:19:59.154
Yes.

228
00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:04.115
Yeah. I kind of figured that.

229
00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:05.552
Where are we going?

230
00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:07.031
I'm getting bad feelings.

231
00:20:07.075 --> 00:20:08.381
All right.

232
00:20:08.424 --> 00:20:10.731
Stop saying you're
having a bad feeling.

233
00:20:10.774 --> 00:20:12.907
All right? Cause you're
making me nervous now.

234
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.256
Just relax.

235
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.649
Let me handle this job
that I have to go do

236
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:18.478
meet up my mans and then I
have to get you to distraction

237
00:20:19.392 --> 00:20:20.523
point.

238
00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:22.264
All right.

239
00:20:25.093 --> 00:20:26.442
Yo it's Stevie.

240
00:20:28.183 --> 00:20:29.358
Yeah. Yeah.

241
00:20:29.402 --> 00:20:31.317
Listen, I'm dropping a
package off for my man.

242
00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:35.886
Right? Cause that's my man.

243
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.018
We'll look out for him.

244
00:20:37.888 --> 00:20:39.238
All right.

245
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:40.587
Yeah, I'll be, I'll
be there in a minute.

246
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.892
All right.

247
00:20:41.936 --> 00:20:42.763
All right later

248
00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.507
Boy, what's goin' on man?

249
00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.900
Same shit as always.

250
00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:50.901
All right.

251
00:20:50.945 --> 00:20:52.338
You got my thing for me?

252
00:20:57.038 --> 00:20:58.213
How's the family man.

253
00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.259
Getting big bird.

254
00:21:00.302 --> 00:21:01.695
Everybody's good.

255
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:06.743
What's up?

256
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:14.577
It says the name of Sal Verde

257
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:19.582
salivary names to ring
a bell over there.

258
00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:27.416
You got this man.

259
00:21:50.396 --> 00:21:51.310
You Verde?

260
00:21:51.353 --> 00:21:52.441
Whose asking?

261
00:21:52.485 --> 00:21:54.400
One nineties

262
00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:55.966
Search him.

263
00:21:57.054 --> 00:21:58.317
Yo what the fuck.

264
00:22:01.058 --> 00:22:02.538
You could never be too safe.

265
00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:05.324
Shut down man.

266
00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:07.326
Now we can do business.

267
00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:11.591
I hear Lenny's holding
it down in these parts.

268
00:22:11.634 --> 00:22:12.374
I guess.

269
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:13.680
I don't know.

270
00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:14.507
Almost would not
be like that, man.

271
00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:17.423
You let him know.

272
00:22:17.466 --> 00:22:20.600
I got a proposition for him.

273
00:22:20.643 --> 00:22:23.037
I understand somebody.

274
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.039
Give me a ring with
the next two hours.

275
00:22:26.606 --> 00:22:29.478
If he doesn't call me
and I dont hear from them

276
00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:31.393
we have a huge fucking problem.

277
00:22:33.613 --> 00:22:38.487
Okay. No one eats out here
unless I have in on it.

278
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:41.751
If I can't eat no one can eat.

279
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:43.144
I want in

280
00:22:43.187 --> 00:22:44.624
All right, man.

281
00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:47.366
All right, you do
that two hours.

282
00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:15.219
What's the fuck.

283
00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:17.178
What do you think?
We found you bitch.

284
00:23:17.221 --> 00:23:18.788
How'd you find me?

285
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:25.708
Where is it?

286
00:23:25.752 --> 00:23:28.276
God. You're too late.

287
00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:29.625
You're lying.

288
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:31.497
No.

289
00:23:32.889 --> 00:23:35.849
I fucking took you on,
I can take you on too.

290
00:23:35.892 --> 00:23:36.676
Come on.

291
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.273

292
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:17.020
Lets go. Chop chop.

Yo nigga hurry up.

Yo what's good

296
00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:56.625
If I don't get my money, you
know what's gonna happen.

297
00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:10.465
Ayo Jason. What the fuck.

298
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.774
Welcome.

299
00:25:23.913 --> 00:25:24.653
Rise and shine.

300
00:25:24.697 --> 00:25:26.437
Yo what the fuck.

301
00:25:28.701 --> 00:25:30.703
Who are you?

302
00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:33.314
What are you doing here.
Do I fucking know you?

303
00:25:33.357 --> 00:25:35.534
What the fuck do you want?

304
00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:39.625
Where's the alien?

305
00:25:39.668 --> 00:25:43.106
Alien? What the fuck
are you talking about?

306
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.544
I'm asking you one more time.

307
00:25:47.328 --> 00:25:48.677
Where is the fucking alien?

308
00:25:48.721 --> 00:25:52.855
I know know what the
fuck you are talking about.

309
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.599
Why you asking me
about an alien for.

310
00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:03.779
Where is the damn alien?

311
00:26:03.823 --> 00:26:07.566
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about

312
00:26:10.743 --> 00:26:14.137
Either the easy
way, or the hard way.

313
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:19.099
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

314
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.670
No, but I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

315
00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:46.256
You sick fuck.

316
00:27:06.407 --> 00:27:08.627
Lights out motherfucker.

317
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:14.763
Di he say anything
about the alien?

318
00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:21.640
Hello. Hello.

319
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:23.076
What the hell?

320
00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:24.686
Where's the alien?

321
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.862
I don't know what you
talkin' about. Which alien?

322
00:27:26.906 --> 00:27:29.517
Like I told you the last time.

323
00:27:31.562 --> 00:27:33.652
You've got one hour

324
00:28:12.908 --> 00:28:15.128
Yo Al. What the
fuck happened man?

325
00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:17.478
I don't know
what happened man.

326
00:28:17.521 --> 00:28:18.784
You all right?

327
00:28:18.827 --> 00:28:19.741
Yeah I am.

328
00:28:19.785 --> 00:28:21.395
What happened to you?

329
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:23.876
Some dudes just came in
looking for some alien.

330
00:28:23.919 --> 00:28:28.532
When I came in, nobody was here.

331
00:28:28.576 --> 00:28:29.446
What dudes?

332
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.404
I don't know what dudes.

333
00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:31.753
Ricky was here when I left.

334
00:28:31.797 --> 00:28:34.930
I'm telling you nobody
was in here. No one.

335
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:38.325
Ricky. Ricky. Hey.

336
00:28:41.067 --> 00:28:41.850
Ricky

337
00:28:41.894 --> 00:28:43.112
Ricky where are you?

338
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:53.557
Oh man Ricky. I'm so sorry.
You didn't deserve this man.

339
00:28:56.778 --> 00:29:01.043
. They're
gonna fucking pay.

340
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:03.829
Oh Jesus.

341
00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.227
I'm sorry. I know you
both were inseparable.

342
00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:12.054
Huh?

343
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:29.419
Ricky's dead man.

344
00:29:29.463 --> 00:29:31.944
The fuck. Are you
serious? He's dead?

345
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:33.902
No this can't be happening.

346
00:29:33.946 --> 00:29:35.599
Who the fuck would do this?

347
00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:37.079
I don't know.

348
00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:40.387
When I came in nobody was
in here. I didn't see nobody.

349
00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:44.043
What did they want?

350
00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:45.914
The wanted an alien, I
don't know, a fucking alien.

351
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:49.265
They were here talking
about some alien shit.

352
00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:51.441
I'm gonna show you
something, don't freak out.

353
00:29:51.485 --> 00:29:53.400
What do you mean
don't freak out?

354
00:29:53.443 --> 00:29:56.055
Just don't freak
out all right.

355
00:30:07.762 --> 00:30:12.767
What the fuck.

356
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:18.512
That's crazy man.

357
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:21.036
I promised Nimo I
would get him home.

358
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.606
Right? So that's
what I going to do.

359
00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:29.740
What I want you to do to
protect yourself back Sammy.

360
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:31.917
This ends tonight.
You understand me?

361
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:32.700
I got you. I got you.

362
00:30:32.743 --> 00:30:33.570
What did I say?

363
00:30:33.614 --> 00:30:35.355
You said call Stevie.

Alright. When does his old man

404
00:33:09.683 --> 00:33:12.555

that son of a bitch

405
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:15.645
Yo G I never see you
like this format.

406
00:33:15.689 --> 00:33:18.648
Money talks and bullshit walks.

407
00:33:18.692 --> 00:33:19.736
Bottom line.

408
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.042
I love it.

409
00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:22.087
All of it.

410
00:33:24.089 --> 00:33:25.699
Good. Let's get a move on.

411
00:33:25.742 --> 00:33:27.614
I just got the text from
the address right now.

412
00:33:27.657 --> 00:33:28.789
It's not far from here.

413
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:38.059
What'd you say you parked at?

414
00:33:38.103 --> 00:33:39.713
Just at the end of the block.

415
00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:41.062
This way?

416
00:33:41.106 --> 00:33:42.107
Yeah.

417
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.151
Don't use the car.

418
00:33:43.195 --> 00:33:44.805
Hold on, hold on one second.

419
00:33:44.848 --> 00:33:47.721
The have a tracking
sensor on it.

420
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.206
I'm becoming very weak.

421
00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:56.686
Nima. You don't
sound too good, man.

422
00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:58.079
Please. Hold on.

423
00:33:58.123 --> 00:34:01.039
Please drink some of
the fluid from the jar.

424
00:34:01.082 --> 00:34:02.562
And add a little bit of water.

425
00:34:02.605 --> 00:34:04.433
I think I got a
bottle of water here.

426
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:11.136
Can you grab one?

427
00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.051
Can you grab a bottle
of water over there?

428
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.793
Hold on brother.

429
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:17.620
Hold on.

430
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.132
Alright brother, you said

431
00:34:53.917 --> 00:34:56.311
you said that there's a
park around here right here.

432
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:59.706
Yeah there should
be a park around here.

433
00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.839
I know exactly what a park is.

434
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:05.059
That it's about 10 minutes.

435
00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:06.104
Deli. We almost there.

436
00:35:07.061 --> 00:35:07.931
Yes, it's close.

437
00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:10.151
C'mon we're almost there.

438
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.852
Yes I'm sensing it
Jackson it is very close.

439
00:35:40.268 --> 00:35:41.269
Jason

440
00:35:41.313 --> 00:35:42.183
Yeah?

441
00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:43.184
Can I ask you something?

442
00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:44.142
Yeah sure.

443
00:35:44.185 --> 00:35:46.361
How come you never smile

444
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.061
I mean I smile, I just
don't smile all the time.

445
00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.805
Hope I get to see it one day.

446
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:56.980
You never know.

447
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:58.808
Maybe it could happen.

448
00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:00.593
Yeah we'll see.

449
00:36:00.636 --> 00:36:02.377
We shall see then.

450
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.864
Hold on.

451
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:15.173
Yo. Aint that, that
mother fucker right there.

452
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:20.265
Yeah. That's that mother
fucker. You want me to take care

453
00:36:20.308 --> 00:36:22.136
of it personally?

454
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.834
I'm taking him myself.

455
00:36:24.878 --> 00:36:25.661
Yo prick.

456
00:36:39.153 --> 00:36:40.198
Yo hold on.

457
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:43.940
I think we lost 'em.

458
00:36:45.115 --> 00:36:46.378
Right I think it was that

459
00:36:46.421 --> 00:36:49.946
fucking longshot Jio.
Mother fucker. Fuck.

460
00:36:51.644 --> 00:36:55.648
Look the good thing is the park
is couple of blocks that way

461
00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.087
Okay. Lets keep
going. Yeah lets go.

462
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.870
You all right?

463
00:37:00.914 --> 00:37:01.567
Yeah , yeah I'm okay.

464
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.090
Sure?

465
00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:04.265
Yeah. How are you?

466
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:05.048
I'm good if you're good.

467
00:37:05.092 --> 00:37:05.832
Yeah I'm good.

468
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:11.403
These motherfuckers. I can't
wait till this day is over.

469
00:37:34.295 --> 00:37:36.079
Welcome to the party.

470
00:37:36.123 --> 00:37:37.690
So what's the situation bro?

471
00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:38.995
We found the alien.

472
00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:39.822
What?

473
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:46.568
So you take care of them yet?

474
00:37:46.612 --> 00:37:50.442
We did, but not all is
passed on to another person.

475
00:37:50.485 --> 00:37:52.444
So there's one dead, and another

476
00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:55.011
that's attempting to get him
to the location, correct?

477
00:37:55.055 --> 00:37:56.361
Have you contacted Dr.

478
00:37:56.404 --> 00:38:00.365
Silva? He knows what
I need to know about.

479
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.285
What don't I
need to know about?

480
00:38:07.328 --> 00:38:08.982
So I knew something was wrong.

481
00:38:09.025 --> 00:38:13.508
When you get didn't
back to me and I waited

482
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:17.338
knowing something was wrong,

483
00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:19.297
I knew you'd call
for assistance.

484
00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.038
Sir we had everything
under control.

485
00:38:22.082 --> 00:38:23.475
Was I speaking to you,

486
00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:28.654
then keep your mouth shut
until I do understood.

487
00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:33.920
What's the situation.

488
00:38:33.963 --> 00:38:38.403
And don't lie to
me or say,

489
00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:50.415
Now there's other person?

490
00:38:50.458 --> 00:38:51.198
Yes sir.

491
00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:53.853
This ends now.

492
00:38:53.896 --> 00:38:55.245
Come again

493
00:38:55.289 --> 00:38:57.596
I'm certain he's
allowed

494
00:39:04.342 --> 00:39:08.476
by allowing the alien
brain expanding is possibly

495
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.260
tightening his senses.

496
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:17.355
Stay with me.

497
00:39:18.704 --> 00:39:20.314
search
the entire area.

498
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:23.491
Once you've found
something, call me.

499
00:39:23.535 --> 00:39:24.449
No weapons?

500
00:39:24.492 --> 00:39:26.146
I want you to slip

501
00:39:26.189 --> 00:39:28.191
 We can't afford
to have the local authority

502
00:39:28.235 --> 00:39:29.628
getting in the way.

503
00:39:29.671 --> 00:39:32.282
We hear you sir.
Loud and clear.

504
00:39:34.459 --> 00:39:38.463
Oh, by the way, Jen, you have
exactly one hour to bring me

505
00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:43.468
back the alien alive.

506
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.323
Merry Christmas bitch.

507
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:24.726
Ayo listen up.

508
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:29.688
Aight. No that motherfucker

509
00:40:32.517 --> 00:40:34.997
You're not listening to me man.

510
00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:37.043
I'm the King of fucking
New York right now.

511
00:40:37.086 --> 00:40:38.479
All right.

512
00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:41.090
Listen. In 20 minutes,
they used to pick me

513
00:40:41.134 --> 00:40:44.224
up on the corner of Westfield
and Chestnut Roselle park.

514
00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:47.532
20 fucking minutes.

515
00:40:47.575 --> 00:40:50.535
That's almost time you
got to come get me.

516
00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:52.667
All right? You understand.
There's some shit I gotta

517
00:40:52.711 --> 00:40:53.668
take care of.

518
00:40:55.453 --> 00:41:00.414
Aight.

519
00:41:36.189 --> 00:41:37.799
Just watch your step.

520
00:41:37.843 --> 00:41:38.583
Watch the twigs.

521
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:42.500
All right. Just follow my lead.

522
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:03.651
Hold on. Come here.

523
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.310
What do you got?

524
00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:11.572
I keep some things around.

525
00:42:14.967 --> 00:42:16.185
Take a look.

526
00:42:16.229 --> 00:42:17.752
Grab something new.

527
00:42:17.796 --> 00:42:19.972
I don't need nothing man.

528
00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.630
Lets get this party started.

529
00:42:47.042 --> 00:42:47.956
Sir

530
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.697
Whoa. You know that guy?

531
00:42:49.741 --> 00:42:52.308
I knew you were
a fucking traitor.

532
00:42:52.352 --> 00:42:55.050
Long what the hell
are you doing here?

533
00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:56.748
Give me the alien now.
Or else I'm gonna bust

534
00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:58.488
your fucking skull.

535
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.847
Here don't worry
about it. Take that.

536
00:43:09.935 --> 00:43:11.763
Lets rock motherfucker.

537
00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:27.300

 brought
a fucking weapon man.

539
00:44:00.333 --> 00:44:03.292
That motherfucker's
right here.

540
00:44:03.336 --> 00:44:06.818
We're innocent civilians.
What are you doing here?

541
00:44:08.297 --> 00:44:09.690
Who says I'm innocent?

542
00:44:12.737 --> 00:44:13.738
Okay.

543
00:44:18.699 --> 00:44:19.831
Nigga. Please.

544
00:45:09.184 --> 00:45:10.925
So this is the spot.

545
00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:15.625
Do you see the open
are in front of you.

546

Nothing is over. Nothing

00:47:45.036 --> 00:47:46.907

584
00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:31.055

11 G's. Why?

586
00:49:37.757 --> 00:49:38.976

00:49:43.719 --> 00:49:44.503

00:49:45.765 --> 00:49:46.635
I wants you to
take Ricky's body

591
00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:47.810

592
00:49:49.725 --> 00:49:52.032
I'm going to take the ashes
down to South Florida.

593
00:49:52.076 --> 00:49:54.556
He always wanted to be
scattered down in the ocean.

594
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.644
The rest of the money.

595
00:49:55.688 --> 00:49:56.906
Keep it for yourself.

596
00:49:58.038 --> 00:49:59.997
You sure?

597
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.781
Yeah. Go with that.

598
00:50:04.088 --> 00:50:06.742
But there's one
thing I need from you.

599
00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:07.787
I need a favor.

600
00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:12.183

It's the motherfucker

607
00:50:31.245 --> 00:50:32.681
He got what he fucking deserved.

608
00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:37.208
Obviously he got a fucking
eyeball hanging out of his head.

609
00:50:39.297 --> 00:50:41.081
What's the favor, man.

610
00:50:41.125 --> 00:50:43.301
I need you to get rid
of this shit from me.

611
00:50:46.217 --> 00:50:48.393

Gee. What's going on, man.

613
00:51:03.495 --> 00:51:08.152
