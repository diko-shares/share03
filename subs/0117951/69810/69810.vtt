00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,502
<i>This is Friday night in my hometown.</i>

2
00:01:06,503 --> 00:01:10,564
<i>Those guys behind me
are actually my neighbors.</i>

3
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:24,395
<i>What is it that you want to be?</i>

4
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:26,856
<i>I gotta go.</i>

5
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,942
<i>It's in a million pieces.</i>

6
00:01:29,943 --> 00:01:32,986
<i>I gotta show you.</i>

7
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,187
Brains.

8
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,455
<i>So, why is everybody so mad?</i>

9
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:26,100
<i>And how did I get stuck
with these two freaks?</i>

10
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:30,655
<i>Well, the aliens showed up.</i>

11
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:34,116
<i>Okay, let me back up.</i>

12
00:02:57,374 --> 00:02:59,867
I'm telling you, this thing
with Lorelei is about to happen.

13
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:01,452
I can feel it in my bones.

14
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:03,954
- Bones? Yeah, that would be cool.
- You're not even listening.

15
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,207
You never listen to me.
You're supposed to be my friend.

16
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,048
What? Look, Lorelei
doesn't like you like that.

17
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,377
If she did,
she'd have given it up by now.

18
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:12,298
I'm saying, I think she does.
I feel like we're right on the cusp.

19
00:03:12,381 --> 00:03:14,175
She's been coming over to my house
more and more lately.

20
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,761
That's because she stashes her weed
at your house.

21
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:19,013
- How did you know that?
- Because her dad's a Christian Scientist

22
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:23,233
and because everyone calls you
her "weed locker."

23
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,702
No.

24
00:03:25,728 --> 00:03:28,030
- People really call me that?
- All the time.

25
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,982
- It makes me look like an idiot.
- Pretty much.

26
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,692
And what do you say to them?
You back me up, right?

27
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:32,902
No.

28
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:34,237
Parminder... - What?

29
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,823
That's your job as a friend,
is to make me look good when people...

30
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,716
- Jesus!
- Are you kidding me?

31
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,551
Dude, you're a terrible friend.

32
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:41,994
Okay.

33
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:47,058
Maybe she has me hold her weed
as an excuse to keep coming over.

34
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,209
- Did you think about that?
- No.

35
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:51,838
That's probably it. Her body language
has been super cuspy lately.

36
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:55,541
- Well, if it's been super cuspy, then...
- Hey, hey, Lor.

37
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:00,795
Yeah, that cuspiness was palpable.

38
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:02,389
Shut up.

39
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:20,383
- Oh, God. Hey, Milan.
- Hey, Petra. How's it going?

40
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:22,760
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

41
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:25,930
- Tonight's the night.
- Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait.

42
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:30,108
Your first vamp party.
You're going to love it.

43
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:35,299
So, I heard that vamp parties
can be kind of rough. Is that...

44
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:37,022
- Hey, that's my locker there.
- Fuck off.

45
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,303
Look, if you're too scared,
we don't have to do this.

46
00:04:39,386 --> 00:04:40,971
What? No, I'm not scared.

47
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:44,641
- That's my special girl. Come on.
- Okay.

48
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,578
- Hey, if I could just get into my locker.
- I said, "Fuck off!"

49
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:52,817
- Oh, we should...
- Come on.

50
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:57,113
Don't ever get in my way again, pussy.

51
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,842
Come on.

52
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,849
- Mr. Keller?
- The teachers' lounge.

53
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,353
- What?
- I'm in the teachers' lounge.

54
00:05:29,854 --> 00:05:31,522
Teachers' lounge.

55
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,858
Teachers' lounge.

56
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:36,527
Teachers' lounge.

57
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:43,576
For the love of Pete. If you finish a pot
of blood, please put another one on.

58
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,412
Can we all do that? We can all do that.

59
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:49,207
Look at this.

60
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,834
Mr. Keller, I just had one quick question
about my paper.

61
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,678
I think there's been an
error in the grading.

62
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,713
Oh, let me guess. You think there's
been an error in the grading

63
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:57,507
because in your mind,
you wrote a wonderful essay

64
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,927
yet you still received a failing grade.
Is that it?

65
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:01,637
That's correct. Um...

66
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,722
And I'd like you to change it.

67
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:07,351
Don't you get it, Ned? Not everything
in your life is under your control.

68
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,062
Sometimes people don't do
what you want them to do.

69
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:12,731
Sometimes you vink at them
and they don't vink back.

70
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,944
- What's a vink?
- It's a cruel world is my point.

71
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,738
It's best you learn that now
before you get the wrong idea. Okay?

72
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:25,160
And the donuts are gone?
The donuts are gone? Huh?

73
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:28,998
We couldn't save one donut?
Not one donut?

74
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:33,836
No, I don't want your quarter of a donut!
I want a full donut!

75
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:38,298
Don't you dare. Don't you fucking dare!

76
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,801
Unbelievable!

77
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,845
Come on, man! For the love of shit!

78
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:48,017
God damn it.

79
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,858
So, you were saying something
about deliberately misgrading my paper

80
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,192
to teach me a lesson?

81
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,241
Ned, I'm so sorry. It's just that
most of the kids that go to this school...

82
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,827
I would love to chain all of them
to their lockers

83
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:10,247
in a manner that would make sure
that they would not escape.

84
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,084
And then just roll sticks of dynamite.
Like, old-fashioned dynamite.

85
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:17,212
Just roll it down the hall
and blow up the school.

86
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:20,299
And then I would spare a couple of faculty.
Not this motherfucker.

87
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,302
I should fucking eat you!

88
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,724
But you, you're amazing, Ned.

89
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,854
You're possibly the best student
I have ever had

90
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:33,397
in the 97 years of teaching at this
godforsaken shit-stain of a school.

91
00:07:33,481 --> 00:07:34,523
Wow.

92
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:38,110
And that's the reason that I...

93
00:07:38,194 --> 00:07:42,073
I have to just strangle your dreams
and break you as a being.

94
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:43,908
I don't understand.

95
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,994
This essay is a masterpiece, Ned.

96
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:52,416
It should be framed and put in some museum
that's dedicated to great essays.

97
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:58,923
And I can't tell you how much joy it
gives me that there's an F there.

98
00:07:59,006 --> 00:08:00,883
That F stands for "Fun."

99
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,095
My fun.

100
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:09,475
Dude, it's crazy. Look, when she's looking
into my eyes, it's like time stops.

101
00:08:09,558 --> 00:08:10,851
She never looks into your eyes.

102
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:14,021
Look, man, you need to just
shut the fuck up and do something about it.

103
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,690
- Okay, like what?
- I don't know. Go caveman on her.

104
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:17,894
Just club her over the head,

105
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,068
drag her back to your cave,
and just... Argh!

106
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:20,277
You're so violent.

107
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,921
All right, well, then next time
you see her, just grab her thigh.

108
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,866
- Just grab her thigh?
- Enjoy your riblet.

109
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,452
This is Lorelei, okay?
I'm not just gonna grab her thigh.

110
00:08:28,536 --> 00:08:31,455
You know what? Last weekend,
I grabbed Kathy Murch's thigh.

111
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,542
She sat on this face, bro.
I gave her a nose job.

112
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:38,295
Okay, number one,
I don't even know what that means.

113
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,882
Number two, Kathy Murch is a slut.

114
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,093
Man, stop judging people.

115
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,720
Unless you like her.

116
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,473
- I kind of do.
- You like her?

117
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,267
Can I get some gazpacho?

118
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:54,312
There's no brains here.

119
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,570
Would you look at that?

120
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,156
Oh, Jesus.

121
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:06,867
Oh, yeah! I'm definitely hitting that.

122
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,785
We're playing you B-squad bitches today.

123
00:09:09,077 --> 00:09:12,747
I'll probably go yard at least twice
and chicks dig the long ball.

124
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:16,668
Hell, I'll probably go three times
if Coach puts in that bitch, Parminder.

125
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,253
I'm sitting right here.

126
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:25,594
Hey, Petra. I hear you're going
to the vamp party tonight.

127
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:27,567
I've always wanted to go to a vamp party.

128
00:09:27,637 --> 00:09:29,764
That's because
you're a total wampire, Leonard.

129
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:31,099
Am not.

130
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,977
Can I come with you?
We can take my dad's Kia.

131
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:37,022
Yeah, I would,
but I'm actually kind of going with Milan.

132
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:40,192
Shut up. Milan Pinache? That's huge.

133
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,445
Oh, my God. Look at her face.
She's totally going to fuck him.

134
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:44,821
Yeah, you better jimmy up.

135
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:48,450
If you actually knew him,
you'd realize Milan's really sweet.

136
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,539
Cockblock me again
and they'll never find your body.

137
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,628
Your brother is such a dickbag.

138
00:09:58,794 --> 00:10:00,004
I know.

139
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:05,301
Thank you.

140
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:11,390
The first pitch I'm
throwing to Chaz, fastball.

141
00:10:11,474 --> 00:10:13,310
- Burn it in.
- Oh, shit!

142
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,020
- What?
- Rick's here.

143
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:17,147
Yeah, he's sponsoring the team this year.

144
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:21,235
The fuckbag fired my mom and every time
I see this asshole, he brings it up.

145
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:22,736
Come on, man.

146
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:24,655
Whatever. He probably
won't even recognize me.

147
00:10:25,155 --> 00:10:26,406
Here you go, son.

148
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,742
The Malphasta Corporation
welcomes you to the Wolves.

149
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:30,077
Congratulations.

150
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,039
Hey! I know you.
You're, uh, Peg Parker's boy.

151
00:10:34,164 --> 00:10:36,250
- Bug? Bag? Tag?
- My name's Dag.

152
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,001
- Doug. Yes, right.
- Dag.

153
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:41,588
Your mom was such a spark plug.
Peg Parker. What's she up to nowadays?

154
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:43,757
Oh, she's good. She's
just around the house.

155
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,425
Oh, how long has she been unemployed?

156
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:47,886
Um, since she left the factory.

157
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:50,889
And why did she leave the factory again?
Wait, wait, I think I have the answer.

158
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:53,308
- Because I fired her.
- Yeah. You fired her.

159
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:54,810
She shouldn't have tried
to unionize my zombies.

160
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,270
- Yeah, can I get a uniform?
- That's the whole idea.

161
00:10:56,353 --> 00:10:58,353
- Can I get a fucking uniform?
- Parker!

162
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:01,191
That was uncalled for.

163
00:11:01,692 --> 00:11:03,212
Come here, son. I want to talk to you.

164
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,115
Come here. Listen.

165
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:10,742
I understand.

166
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:13,626
You know, I remember what it was like
to be in high school. It's tough.

167
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:18,792
Especially for a big, tall,
freaky motherfucker like you.

168
00:11:19,543 --> 00:11:21,253
- I'm fine with it.
- Okay, okay.

169
00:11:21,378 --> 00:11:22,879
- I like my body.
- All right.

170
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:24,483
Let me help you out. A word of advice.

171
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,301
Stop concentrating on the negative.
All right?

172
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:31,221
Look at the bright side.
You get to spend more time with your mom.

173
00:11:32,556 --> 00:11:38,438
And I have a new secretary
who I have sex with.

174
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,066
With my penis.

175
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:45,403
Lots of people have sex with their penises.

176
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,575
Seeing as how I paid for this field,

177
00:11:50,658 --> 00:11:53,411
Coach Pulcifer asked me to come down
here today and say a few words,

178
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:55,413
so here I am.

179
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:01,085
I want you to look into the eyes of the boy
sitting next to you. Go ahead, do it.

180
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:03,755
And repeat after me.

181
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:06,299
"You are not my teammate."

182
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,967
You are not my teammate.

183
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:10,511
"You are not my friend."

184
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:12,263
You are not my friend!

185
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:15,350
"You are my enemy"

186
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,810
"and must be destroyed."

187
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,355
You are my enemy and must be destroyed!

188
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:21,522
Chill, dude.

189
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:25,443
Winners and losers, boys.
That's what makes America great.

190
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:29,782
Look at me. When I first came to Dillford,
the meat plant was underperforming

191
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:34,119
and I drove an '04 Ford Taurus.

192
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:40,709
But now the riblet is the crown jewel
of the Malphasta Corporation

193
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:45,339
- and I drive a red Porsche Boxster.
- Whoo!

194
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:49,968
How? I fired the dead weight
and brought in cheap zombie labor.

195
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,138
Why? Because I came here to win.

196
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,265
Out of the 25 boys seated here today

197
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:59,645
23 of you will go on to lead
completely inconsequential lives.

198
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,773
For the other two boys,
it'll be a different journey.

199
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:04,859
One of them will just drop dead
for no reason. Poof. Nobody knows why.

200
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,987
Heart attack, aneurysm,
stabbed in the heart in a mall parking lot.

201
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,322
Bang, gone.

202
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:12,492
But the other boy,
whoever that chosen boy is,

203
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:16,538
he will be a shining fucking star like me.

204
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,207
- This guy.
- He's so amazing.

205
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,994
- Strike three!
- Let's go, let's put one in play.

206
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,931
Wow. Parker's got a rocket for an arm, huh?

207
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:28,508
Yeah. The best I've ever seen.
Too bad he's shit under pressure.

208
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:30,009
All right, let's go!

209
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,477
- It's on.
- Come on, put one in there.

210
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,937
Come on, man.
Damn it. Dick.

211
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:45,859
Pay attention, Lor.
I'm about to teach this bitch a lesson.

212
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,611
Teach him gently, baby.
That boy's my neighbor.

213
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,242
Okay, nice boy, bring the cheese home.

214
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,704
It better be Swiss because I'm holy, baby.
I'm holy, baby.

215
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,924
Looking good, Dag.
Looking good, man.

216
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,916
Find the zone, Dag!

217
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,420
I'm going to rape you.

218
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:23,271
Oh, Jesus.

219
00:14:23,438 --> 00:14:25,231
Oh, my God. Say something.

220
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:26,734
Dag, what did you do?

221
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,070
Are you okay? Oh, gosh.
Okay, we need to get him ice.

222
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,405
Dag!

223
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,576
Oh, my God! Okay, okay!
Okay, okay! Okay, okay!

224
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,179
- It's going to be okay.
- Rick, I'm still number one!

225
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,749
Yeah! All right.

226
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,253
- I went out and got wrecked.
- It's in the car.

227
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,848
- Wait, should we go back to the party?
- No.

228
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:00,392
I'm great right here.

229
00:15:00,476 --> 00:15:01,769
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,149
Wait.

231
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,027
Is it going to hurt?

232
00:15:09,444 --> 00:15:11,196
A little, at first.

233
00:15:12,447 --> 00:15:14,157
But then ecstasy.

234
00:15:14,658 --> 00:15:15,825
Yeah?

235
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:26,336
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, what am I doing?

236
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:30,138
You said you wanted to go all the way
with me.

237
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,385
I thought you meant sex, not that.

238
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,516
Are you kidding me?

239
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:42,352
I thought you were cool, Petra.

240
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,570
But why don't you want to be with me
my way?

241
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:53,990
I already went down that road with Lorelei.

242
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,410
You slept with Lorelei?

243
00:15:57,493 --> 00:16:01,163
Don't you get it?
Lorelei had me for 17 minutes.

244
00:16:02,832 --> 00:16:04,375
I'm offering you forever.

245
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:07,670
Do you really mean that?

246
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:11,382
Do you have any idea
how long I've waited for a girl like you?

247
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:17,763
Centuries.

248
00:16:35,865 --> 00:16:37,158
Honey, you're staring again.

249
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:39,452
The doctor said it would be off
in a year or two, tops.

250
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:43,122
Two years?
If you were a dog, I would put you down.

251
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,710
Out of love and kindness. A mercy kill.

252
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,255
Do you not get it? You've got nothing
to live for. This is what you had.

253
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:53,633
- His life is over.
- Okay.

254
00:16:53,883 --> 00:16:56,636
He's not a creature of the mind.
He's physical.

255
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:59,930
We're done. We're done, God, you hear me?

256
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:01,807
We're done.

257
00:17:03,142 --> 00:17:06,062
I know you're probably thinking
about killing yourself. I don't blame you.

258
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:09,303
But don't do it because you might get
better. If you don't get better, go for it.

259
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,609
May I be excused, Mom?

260
00:17:11,776 --> 00:17:13,569
Uh, honey, I know that you're upset
about Chaz Jr.

261
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:17,324
But it's important that we stay together
as a family right now.

262
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:19,576
I didn't say I was upset about Chaz.

263
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,329
Mr. Keller gave me an F on my paper today.

264
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:27,209
Whoa. Nerd Boy's getting F's
and hanging out with zombies.

265
00:17:27,292 --> 00:17:28,418
Zombies?

266
00:17:28,502 --> 00:17:31,380
I wasn't hanging with zombies.
She was just helping me with my gazpacho.

267
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,590
Why can't you just eat a riblet
like everyone else?

268
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:37,929
For the millionth time, I'm allergic. Besides,
do you have any idea what's in a riblet?

269
00:17:38,096 --> 00:17:42,433
- Tiny ribs.
- Hormones, stimulants, tetrafluoraxipan.

270
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:45,520
It's a chemical compound
otherwise known as TXP.

271
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:49,857
Okay, Mr. Wizard, enlighten us.
What's so bad about TXP?

272
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,943
- Leading cause of liver failure.
- Who cares?

273
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,778
- Prenatal scoliosis.
- So what?

274
00:17:53,861 --> 00:17:56,197
- Diabetes.
- Doesn't matter.

275
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,116
Pain in the ankles.

276
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:00,118
Yeah, that would be hard
for sports and whatnot, yeah.

277
00:18:00,201 --> 00:18:01,953
- Also, puff tongue!
- Puff tongue?

278
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,371
- Yeah, puff tongue.
- Puff tongue?

279
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:04,580
- Puff tongue.
- Pfft.

280
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,582
Oh, oh, oh. How terrible.

281
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,877
Just think of all those little kids
with puffy tongues. What?

282
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:15,800
If this TXP stuff was really so unhealthy

283
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,428
they wouldn't put it in the riblets,
now would they?

284
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:20,972
It's what Saturn is made of.
Do you know Saturn?

285
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,141
I know Saturn, a classy economy car.

286
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:27,395
I'm so sorry about the F, honey.
You'll get them next time.

287
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,356
There's no next time. Do you know
what an F does to my transcript?

288
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:31,524
No.

289
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,652
- I can kiss my scholarship goodbye.
- You can kiss college goodbye.

290
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,112
What?

291
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:38,956
I'm sorry, but let's cut the shit, people.
We're in deep trouble here.

292
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,911
Do you have any idea
how much this crapola costs?

293
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:44,538
- Doesn't insurance cover that?
- Insurance is for suckers, Ned.

294
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:47,903
From now on, when you're not in school,
I'm going to need you down at the car lot.

295
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,169
Dad, dickbag gets to sell Hyundais
and I don't?

296
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:53,046
Oh, I think that's a fantastic idea.

297
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:55,591
- I'm going to my room.
- This one.

298
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,350
Why do you think he left the room?
It's because he doesn't want to talk.

299
00:19:02,514 --> 00:19:03,849
Do you got a minute?

300
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:13,692
Ned, listen, I know that at times it seems
like it's awkward between you and I.

301
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:17,696
I'm excited that the two of us are going
to get to spend more time together.

302
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,282
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

303
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,451
Yeah. I do. I really do.

304
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,870
I mean, if you want,
you can start coming to competitions.

305
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:27,331
There's Mathletes on Saturday
and then there's Odyssey of the Mind.

306
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:29,833
And there's father-son NASA,
which I think that you would really like.

307
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:33,420
No, no, no. You're overthinking this.
You overthink everything.

308
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:35,464
Maybe just the father-son NASA.
You don't have to...

309
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,801
Look, right now I need you down at the lot.

310
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,719
With the extra hours, if we're lucky

311
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,388
maybe Jr.'s dream of making the pros
still has a chance.

312
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:45,224
What about my dreams?

313
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,812
What dreams?

314
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:53,106
Uh, well, for starters,
I want to be an engineer someday.

315
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:56,985
Son, how many times do we have to
go over this? No one rides trains anymore!

316
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:58,904
You gotta stop living in the clouds
and get real.

317
00:19:58,987 --> 00:20:02,783
If it's not the lot, you can work at the riblet
plant, be a meat bleacher like your mom.

318
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:06,079
I did 10 years on the ammonia hose
and I regret nothing.

319
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:10,751
I don't want to work the ammonia hose
or be a stupid freaking Hyundai salesman.

320
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,046
Whoa! Slow your roll, tiger.
Leave the Hyundai Corporation out of this.

321
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,466
Stop telling me to slow my roll!
Chaz Jr. doesn't have to slow his roll!

322
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,760
How come I'm the only one around here
who has to slow his roll?

323
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,805
Listen, I understand we're all upset
about Chaz Jr.

324
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,640
- Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Fuck Chaz Jr.?

325
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,643
- Yeah. Fuck Chaz Jr.
- Nobody fucks Chaz Jr.!

326
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,979
Ned, don't go! Chaz!

327
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:33,649
Don't point your finger at us!
Point it at your old friend, Dag!

328
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,444
He's the one who threw that pitch!
He's the one who ruined our lives!

329
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,456
Hmm. Mmm.

330
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,876
I just love your waterbed.

331
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,128
It's the best.

332
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,549
- You know, I'm surprised you're still around.
- What do you mean?

333
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,844
I mean that stunt you pulled today
on the baseball field.

334
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:06,974
We were all set to win State
and Chaz Jr. was going to get scouted.

335
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,893
Yeah.

336
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,978
What were you thinking?

337
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,981
I don't know. I guess...

338
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,358
I sort of... I wanted to...

339
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,820
Like, impress you.

340
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,406
- Really?
- Yeah.

341
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,825
That's so sweet.

342
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,498
- Why would you want to impress me?
- What?

343
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:36,838
I said, why would you want to impress me?

344
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,551
Lorelei,

345
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,721
I think I might be in love with you.

346
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:53,355
Dag, you are the weirdest,
funniest boy I know.

347
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,857
I don't know what I would do without you.

348
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,908
Sweetheart, you know I'm saving myself.

349
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,619
Be right there.

350
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,746
Are you leaving?

351
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,540
Yeah, all this talking about sex
is making me really hungry. So...

352
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,001
- Yeah. Me, too.
- I'm going to go to Burger King.

353
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,211
Yeah, a Whopper sounds good.

354
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,504
- Right?
- Yeah, let's do it.

355
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,964
- I'll smell you later.
- Okay.

356
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,633
Yeah?

357
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:24,719
Ah...

358
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,390
Uh...

359
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,599
Oh.

360
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,321
Dag, your mother and I
don't want to encourage pot smoking.

361
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,450
But we want you to know that

362
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,245
we completely understand it.

363
00:22:50,121 --> 00:22:51,872
- It's actually not my weed.
- Very good.

364
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:53,917
- Okay. Well, Dag...
- We get it.

365
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:58,547
That's what we're saying.
It's Lorelei's and if it wasn't

366
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,590
well, whatever, whatever, whatever.

367
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:03,135
Okay, thank you for being so understanding,

368
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,179
but in this case
you're not understanding correctly.

369
00:23:06,346 --> 00:23:10,684
Okay. Your mother and I understand
what you're saying.

370
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:14,104
It's hard to express how much we understand

371
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:15,981
on a daily basis.

372
00:23:16,189 --> 00:23:21,445
Really. Like, even 15 minutes ago,
we totally understood.

373
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:22,654
- We got it.
- Really?

374
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,698
I didn't know that you
understood that much.

375
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,616
- Twice a day, at least.
- Well, whenever.

376
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,453
We're on an understanding plane.

377
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,621
- Look at that. Look at that.
- It's like an ice skating rink.

378
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:34,624
- Look at this. I'm getting trails.
- Wow.

379
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:38,712
Mom, is there anything else
you wanted to talk about?

380
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:40,005
- No.
- No.

381
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:41,256
Oh.

382
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:44,384
We wanted to talk to you
about some of the changes

383
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,179
that happen to your body as you get older.

384
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:50,640
- Don't do that talk.
- The thing is, the men of the Parker clan...

385
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:54,061
Um, well, we change relatively slowly.

386
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:58,482
But, now don't be frightened,
when the change comes, it is...

387
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:00,984
- Enormous.
- Enormous.

388
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:02,444
No, no, no.

389
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:05,280
A lot of girls will be frightened.

390
00:24:05,363 --> 00:24:08,992
In fact, it took me a while
to get used to it, but it's big.

391
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:11,411
- It's a big change.
- Wow. And it's...

392
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,538
Whoomp, there it is.

393
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:15,832
No, no. I can't talk right now with you.

394
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,253
I'm sorry. You know, everything's in order.
So...

395
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:20,880
- That's fine.
- We just wanted to talk about it.

396
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:24,050
- Later, alligator.
- Okay. Bye, Dad.

397
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,302
We'll just leave you to
your marijuana, okay?

398
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,513
I'm about to get so high.

399
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:31,307
Oh, my little frowny clowny.

400
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:36,687
Beep!

401
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:37,814
I love you.

402
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:39,357
- You are...
- All right.

403
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,086
Gazpacho boy.

404
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,213
Oh, hey.

405
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:04,465
You remember me.

406
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:06,551
Sure. Lunch.

407
00:25:07,385 --> 00:25:10,054
Yeah. It was real cool of you
to help me out today. Thanks.

408
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,264
Uh-huh.

409
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,892
- Is that your family over there?
- Yeah.

410
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:18,397
Dad, Mom, some guy called Steve.

411
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:21,817
It seems like you guys all get along.

412
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:25,821
They're good. They share brains.

413
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:33,245
Now, what's it like being a zombie?

414
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:36,165
Do you get sad?

415
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:38,750
Basically, I eat brains.

416
00:25:39,626 --> 00:25:42,422
- And it tastes yummy.
- That must be nice.

417
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:44,757
Think fast, you zombie fuck!

418
00:25:51,097 --> 00:25:52,807
So, that didn't even bother you?

419
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:55,602
- What?
- That asshole just hit you with a slushee.

420
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,229
- He did?
- Yeah, he did.

421
00:25:58,313 --> 00:25:59,355
Oh...

422
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:01,274
Did he?

423
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:05,320
You don't feel anything, do you?

424
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:11,159
Okay, go ahead.

425
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:14,787
Take a bite.

426
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:18,166
What? Brains, not foot.

427
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:20,543
Well, there's a brain in the foot.

428
00:26:20,627 --> 00:26:23,504
- Brain in foot?
- Yeah, I put them in there for you.

429
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,798
Foot brain for me?

430
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:29,135
Bite it before they...
I can feel them, they're going to leave.

431
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:31,512
- Foot brain?
- Just bite the brain foot, okay?

432
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:33,181
- Brain foot.
- Hurry!

433
00:26:57,455 --> 00:27:00,541
<i>I know you're antiseptic.</i>

434
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,586
<i>Your deodorant smells nice</i>

435
00:27:05,046 --> 00:27:07,967
<i>I'd like to get to know you.</i>

436
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,179
<i>You're deep frozen like the ice.</i>

437
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,100
<i>She's a germ free adolescent</i>

438
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:22,189
<i>Cleanliness is her obsession.</i>

439
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,357
Ugh.

440
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,942
<i>Cleans her teeth ten times a day</i>

441
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,445
<i>Scrub away scrub away scrub away.</i>

442
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:31,365
<i>The S.R. way...</i>

443
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:38,914
<i>You may get to touch her</i>

444
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:44,295
<i>If your gloves are sterilized.</i>

445
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,673
<i>Rinse your mouth with Listerine</i>

446
00:27:47,882 --> 00:27:48,883
<i>Blow disinfectant...</i>

447
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:59,936
- Petra, is that you?
- Hey, Kathy, how are you?

448
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:02,802
I actually don't need that magazine.
That's fine, thanks.

449
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,177
I think I'm going to just leave.

450
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,236
Oh, sorry.

451
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,489
Whoa. I never pegged you for a vamp, Petra.

452
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,907
I'm not.

453
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,329
<i>Once I walked a lonely road</i>

454
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,752
<i>I had no one to share my love.</i>

455
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:29,591
<i>But then you came and showed the way.</i>

456
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:35,181
<i>And now I hope you're here to stay</i>

457
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:45,149
<i>Hey, it's Milan. Leave a message.</i>

458
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:52,406
<i>You give me light You are my day.</i>

459
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,283
<i>You give me life.</i>

460
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,659
Come on!

461
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,328
<i>And that's right.</i>

462
00:28:57,828 --> 00:29:04,668
<i>So right, so right, so right.</i>

463
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,137
What the...

464
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,837
All right. Everybody,
if you give me a couple of seconds

465
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,172
I will explain everything I know.

466
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:53,717
- Who put you in charge?
- I'm sorry. Do you own a riblet plant?

467
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,138
No. No.

468
00:29:56,221 --> 00:30:00,684
Is that your sexy Porsche Boxster
parked outside? No.

469
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,686
Sit down and shut the fuck up.

470
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:07,691
All we know so far

471
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:11,069
is that the spacecraft arrived
around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday.

472
00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:12,237
What do they want?

473
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,531
We don't know
because we haven't made contact yet.

474
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:16,408
So why did they come?

475
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:18,870
That's just a rephrasing of the question
you just asked.

476
00:30:19,203 --> 00:30:20,538
How...

477
00:30:22,206 --> 00:30:23,374
When...

478
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:28,463
Okay, am I just high
or is everyone here suddenly retarded?

479
00:30:29,547 --> 00:30:30,923
Can't it be both?

480
00:30:32,592 --> 00:30:35,470
- I'm going to go smoke up in your car.
- Anybody else?

481
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:36,721
- Really?
- Yeah.

482
00:30:36,804 --> 00:30:38,306
I have a goddamn question.

483
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:42,560
If the vampires haven't made contact,
why aren't there any here?

484
00:30:42,935 --> 00:30:44,103
Yeah!

485
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:50,985
But seriously, does anyone in this room
doubt the possibility

486
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:54,405
that the humans brought the aliens here
to eliminate us?

487
00:30:54,489 --> 00:30:56,991
- No!
- Nobody doubts that, right?

488
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:59,160
They've been wanting to get rid of us
for years.

489
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:01,412
- Yeah!
- And now they found a way.

490
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:05,082
How many of you out there
have had your wife or your girlfriend

491
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,586
cheat on you with one of these
cold-blooded ecstasy machines?

492
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,130
Raise your hand. Don't be ashamed.
Raise your hand.

493
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:14,050
Okay, I see about 50 liars out there.

494
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,428
They write books about us.
They make movies about us.

495
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:21,183
They dress up like us at Halloween.
They're all wampires.

496
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:24,019
- Just vampire wannabes.
- Yeah!

497
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,729
They could do without this planet,
God damn it.

498
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:28,857
They don't need to breathe the air
or drink the water.

499
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:31,109
We're the ones
that need to defend this planet!

500
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:34,530
I read that they
are putting garlic in our blood

501
00:31:34,613 --> 00:31:36,907
and you doubt
that they're working with the aliens?

502
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,953
We're going to go and make
a preemptive strike right now!

503
00:31:41,995 --> 00:31:44,790
- Are you with me? Are you with me?
- Yeah!

504
00:31:44,998 --> 00:31:48,001
We need to preempt their preemptive strike

505
00:31:48,126 --> 00:31:50,128
with a preemptive preemptive strike.

506
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,800
I thought this meeting
was supposed to be about the aliens.

507
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:57,678
Aren't you listening, you idiot?
It's all about the aliens.

508
00:31:59,304 --> 00:32:01,723
Yeah! Yeah!

509
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,202
Why isn't he saying anything?

510
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:26,039
About what?

511
00:32:27,416 --> 00:32:29,167
About the aliens.

512
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:36,675
Hey. Hey, excuse me.

513
00:32:38,677 --> 00:32:41,662
Did you call this meeting for a reason?

514
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,868
Brain rations no come today.

515
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:57,079
Do you think that maybe
it had something to do with the aliens?

516
00:32:57,097 --> 00:32:58,749
Aliens?

517
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:03,037
Guys, brain rations didn't come

518
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,172
because nobody gives a shit about you.

519
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:08,626
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:11,361
Aren't you tired of being dismissed?

521
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:17,366
Just dismissed. Aren't you tired
of being treated like nothing?

522
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,630
Yeah? Well, why don't we
do something about it, huh?

523
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,773
Yeah!

524
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:31,898
Unbelievable.

525
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:34,851
No wonder you guys are locked up.

526
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:55,655
Bloodsucking traitors!

527
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:02,179
<i>Tonight's the night,
let's drive downtown.</i>

528
00:34:02,262 --> 00:34:05,765
<i>The kids are out
can't you hear the sound</i>

529
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,061
<i>They wanna rock all night and day.</i>

530
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:11,197
<i>But the price is steep,
can they afford to pay.</i>

531
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:14,017
<i>The devil's game is a danger zone.</i>

532
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:18,821
God, I fucking hate you!
You're the worst teacher!

533
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:23,409
<i>I wanna Rock and Roll
I got an Evil Soul.</i>

534
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:25,593
Fuck yes!

535
00:34:25,662 --> 00:34:28,497
What are you doing?

536
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,606
- What's cracking?
- Only the end of the freaking world.

537
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,107
That's cool.

538
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,969
I'm not kidding.
The entire town is murdering each other.

539
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:44,222
Oh, in that case,
I guess there's just one thing to do.

540
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,273
God...

541
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,776
Damn, that's a close shave.

542
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,829
I mean, I wouldn't want
you to die a virgin.

543
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:54,348
Sex.

544
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:57,535
We'll go to my house
to have sex. Let's go.

545
00:35:00,363 --> 00:35:02,923
Milan, hey.

546
00:35:02,932 --> 00:35:05,568
- Just give us a second, babe.
- Okay. We'll be by the car.

547
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:06,786
What? Hey!

548
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,973
I think there's something wrong with
your phone. I've been trying you all night.

549
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,958
- Yeah, Petra, look...
- How messed up is this alien thing?

550
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,602
I'm like, freaking out.

551
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:17,871
The truth is, Petra,
I'm just not that into you.

552
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:19,915
You're just not that into me?

553
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:24,480
My soul is undead for all of eternity
and you're not that fucking into me?

554
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,766
Chill. Or I'll rip your face off.

555
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:33,923
Just tell me why.

556
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:38,494
Why did you sleep with Lorelei
but bite me?

557
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:43,382
Lorelei's a nasty freak
with the body of a porn star.

558
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,510
I'm having sex with that.

559
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:49,071
But you said I was beautiful. Right?

560
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,849
When I see veins like that,
I say a lot of things.

561
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,519
It's that pale skin, P.

562
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:58,130
You're like a walking pop machine.

563
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:04,387
Come on.

564
00:36:11,645 --> 00:36:15,172
See, baby?
Being a vampire ain't all bad.

565
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:19,418
You're such a dick.

566
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,999
For fuck's sake!

567
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:30,330
Oh! No way!

568
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:36,961
So, are we going to do this?
Or what?

569
00:36:37,003 --> 00:36:38,971
What?

570
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,957
Oh, dear God.

571
00:36:42,926 --> 00:36:45,202
Okay. Okay.

572
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:48,030
Yeah. We've got to be quick.

573
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:50,438
That's probably not going to be an issue.

574
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:02,912
Lorelei, don't go!

575
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:11,455
- Lorelei, come on! Come on.
- Jeez, man, where's the fire?

576
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,758
Holy shit!

577
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,644
No! Lorelei!

578
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,332
Bring it, bloodsuckers!

579
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,124
Fuck you!

580
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:32,317
Fuck you, too!

581
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:49,635
Holy fuck, Mr. Mosely.
That was awesome.

582
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,963
Awesome? Hell, I've been training for this
since you were in Huggies.

583
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,001
Bowflex, Soloflex, coed Capoeira.

584
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:58,437
It's all paying off.

585
00:37:58,503 --> 00:38:00,972
Now, come with me if you want to live.

586
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:04,159
Oh, God!

587
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:07,095
No! Please! Oh, God!

588
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,864
- The zombies are eating me!
- Stop!

589
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:11,583
- The zombies are eating me!
- No, stop eating him!

590
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:14,619
I'm a zombie all-you-can-eat buffet.

591
00:38:14,686 --> 00:38:15,771
Oh, God!

592
00:38:15,854 --> 00:38:18,923
- God, I'm going to be sick.
- Why won't I pass out?

593
00:38:18,941 --> 00:38:22,611
God, please let me die.

594
00:38:22,612 --> 00:38:27,233
He just put some intestines back
and took different intestines!

595
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,160
What the fuck does it matter?

596
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:32,237
- Why are we still watching?
- I don't know.

597
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:35,183
They ripped off my arm!

598
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,477
That was my bowling arm.

599
00:38:37,543 --> 00:38:40,088
They're eating my bowling arm.

600
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:42,590
I'm dying.

601
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:45,593
This is it.

602
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:47,804
Humans over there!
Let's get them!

603
00:38:48,388 --> 00:38:49,555
Run.

604
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,724
What the fuck?

605
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,060
I came back to fucking life!

606
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:58,731
"porn star, but you're really
all pale and veiny."

607
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,109
Fucking pale and veiny.

608
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:04,529
You fucking prick. You
stupid slut, Lorelei.

609
00:39:06,447 --> 00:39:07,949
Motherfucker.

610
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:26,801
Holy shit!

611
00:39:36,602 --> 00:39:38,521
Shh!

612
00:39:39,605 --> 00:39:41,774
- Good boy. That's a good boy.
- Shut the fuck up. That's a good boy.

613
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:43,151
Quiet.

614
00:39:48,657 --> 00:39:49,950
Brains.

615
00:39:54,955 --> 00:39:56,874
Brains!

616
00:39:58,459 --> 00:39:59,752
No! No!

617
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,493
Dag, help me!

618
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,008
No!

619
00:41:05,235 --> 00:41:06,903
No!

620
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,076
Brains!

621
00:41:56,078 --> 00:41:57,913
- Bring it, fuckers.
- Really?

622
00:41:58,164 --> 00:42:00,457
"Bring it, fuckers."
That's the line you're going with?

623
00:42:01,167 --> 00:42:02,501
Shut up!

624
00:42:29,653 --> 00:42:30,863
Holy...

625
00:42:30,946 --> 00:42:32,448
fucking...

626
00:42:33,532 --> 00:42:34,993
brains.

627
00:42:39,706 --> 00:42:41,291
I'm getting the hell out of here.

628
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:46,796
Mrs. Miller! Are you in there?

629
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,280
- How did you know this was here?
- This is my piano teacher.

630
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,637
Mrs. Miller, please open up! They're coming!

631
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,889
Hey, this is Stuart Miller, her son!

632
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:59,477
And I know they're coming! I've been
predicting a vampire attack for 10 years!

633
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:02,730
Stuart, hey, it's Dag.
It's not the vampires.

634
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:06,025
It is the aliens.
Open up the goddamn door, Stuart.

635
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,693
It's aliens?

636
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:12,198
Okay, listen. Has anyone tried
singing to them or playing a song

637
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:13,991
and then maybe they play a song back?

638
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:16,535
They don't seem open
to any kind of music or anything like that.

639
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:20,373
Has anyone stayed around long enough
to see a bowel movement?

640
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:24,669
Maybe we get processed through their body
and then they crap us out as higher beings.

641
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:28,839
It would be disgusting to us, but for them,
that could just be a cultural norm.

642
00:43:28,923 --> 00:43:31,008
Open up the goddamn door, Stuart!

643
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:33,803
Wait a minute. How do I
know that you're Dag

644
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:36,847
and not an alien wearing Dag's skin
as some kind of meat suit?

645
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:42,103
Um, my mom's name is Peg. I have dark hair.
I really like, uh, miso soup.

646
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,868
"Meep, map, morp, I'm an alien."
That's what I'm hearing right now.

647
00:43:44,897 --> 00:43:46,899
- I'm speaking English.
- Listen, hey! Pop quiz.

648
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,401
What was the memorable thing
that happened

649
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:51,696
during your sixth grade piano recital
when you were halfway through

650
00:43:51,779 --> 00:43:53,698
<i>Erik Satie's Gymnopédies No. 3?</i>

651
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:56,951
All right, I shit my pants! And you said
you had never seen a boy shit so much!

652
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,205
The Dillford Shitter. It's him.

653
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:01,623
Oh.

654
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:05,168
- Come on, come on. Let's go.
- Thank you for believing me.

655
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:06,628
- Come here. Come on, come on.
- It's great to see you.

656
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:07,754
Okay. Dude.

657
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:08,838
Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!

658
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,049
- No, no! It's good. It's all good.
- I'm Petra.

659
00:44:11,133 --> 00:44:15,220
Nah-uh. No. If I'm going to have a succubus
and a shambler in my command bunker

660
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:18,223
we're going to set a couple
of ground rules, okay? I'm alpha dog.

661
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:23,228
Nana is alpha female. You're number three,
then the girl, then the retard.

662
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:24,396
Great. Good order.

663
00:44:24,479 --> 00:44:27,316
Okay. I feel very
uncomfortable saying this,

664
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:29,318
but, um...

665
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,486
we may have to breed.

666
00:44:31,987 --> 00:44:33,071
Oh.

667
00:44:34,573 --> 00:44:35,615
Is he looking at me?

668
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,581
- Son, did you lock the trapdoor?
- On it, sir.

669
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:39,494
Let's go! Assholes and elbows!

670
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,159
Code Blue, Nana. Code Blue, Nana.

671
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:53,842
Hey, Mrs. Miller, after all this is done,
I'd love to start taking lessons again.

672
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:56,511
- What the shit? What? No, no, no.
- Oh. Oh.

673
00:44:57,846 --> 00:45:00,515
- Sorry.
- "Sorry"? You ate the Millers.

674
00:45:00,807 --> 00:45:03,769
Yeah, I know. They were just standing
there. We were like, "Should we?"

675
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,855
Dag, don't be ridiculous.

676
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,316
I'm not being ridiculous.
You're being ridiculous.

677
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:10,776
You killed my piano teacher.

678
00:45:12,652 --> 00:45:15,280
That was then.
This is two minutes from then.

679
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:17,199
You killed Lorelei, too.

680
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:19,743
Well, guess what? We're all you've got now.

681
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:23,246
It's just you and me and him.
If one of us dies, we all die.

682
00:45:23,331 --> 00:45:27,293
- He's still eating my piano teacher.
- Oh, shit. Ned, drop it.

683
00:45:27,668 --> 00:45:28,961
Drop it.

684
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,805
This is so fucked.

685
00:45:56,198 --> 00:45:57,825
Jesus.

686
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:00,382
What do you think they're doing up there?

687
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,873
That's okay, I can talk.

688
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,441
Do you remember the last time
we were in a basement together?

689
00:46:11,255 --> 00:46:14,883
It was sixth grade. Uh, Greg
Sheffler's party. Remember?

690
00:46:15,426 --> 00:46:19,179
We played seven minutes in heaven.
You told everyone you touched my boobs.

691
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:22,975
I don't think that that happened, per Se.

692
00:46:23,058 --> 00:46:24,643
I probably did touch them.

693
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:27,604
No, you didn't! You just walked around
calling yourself "The Titty Whisperer."

694
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,857
- I don't call boobs titties.
- Of course.

695
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,692
So where did they get it into their minds

696
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:34,278
that you had whispered to any boobs
or any titties?

697
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:38,991
Because we had to whisper downstairs and
everybody assumed there would be titties

698
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:42,911
because you are the girl and I'm the guy
and usually the girl takes her titties out

699
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:45,247
and the guy usually touches them.
That's how it goes.

700
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:46,707
Do you want to know
what everybody called me?

701
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,376
- What?
- They called me a slut.

702
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:52,297
Do you remember that? Hello?
Do you remember that or not?

703
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,423
Petra, I'm sorry.

704
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:57,469
It was sixth grade, I didn't know
what I was doing, and I'm sorry.

705
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:01,973
It's fine.

706
00:47:05,226 --> 00:47:07,604
I probably didn't have any titties
to whisper to anyway.

707
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,106
Nobody did.

708
00:47:15,069 --> 00:47:17,155
It was dark in that laundry room,
but I remember something.

709
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,243
So, who are you these days?

710
00:47:22,827 --> 00:47:25,455
I don't know. How do you even answer
a question like that?

711
00:47:26,247 --> 00:47:27,957
- Are you a jock?
- Hardly.

712
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,628
All I know about you
is that you grew six inches one month.

713
00:47:32,337 --> 00:47:34,297
Yeah, that hurt my knees.

714
00:47:36,007 --> 00:47:39,093
- Are you a stoner?
- Not really. That was Lorelei's thing.

715
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,472
Right. Because it must have been
so tough for her to get through the day

716
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:45,517
with her mermaid hair and her gumdrop ass.

717
00:47:45,642 --> 00:47:49,646
Lay off her. You killed her.
Isn't that enough?

718
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:53,274
- You really cared about Lorelei?
- Yeah, I did, actually.

719
00:47:54,484 --> 00:47:57,737
- So, why did you hesitate?
- Hesitate?

720
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,948
On the stairs.
When I grabbed her, you hesitated.

721
00:48:00,031 --> 00:48:04,078
I didn't hesitate. You're thinking about the
moment when I have to process the whole...

722
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:06,747
Look. All I'm saying is that
when you really care about somebody

723
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,707
you don't hesitate or process.

724
00:48:08,791 --> 00:48:09,917
You just jump right in.

725
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,126
Oh, just jump right in?

726
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,891
I guess that's how you made
the genius decision to become a vampire.

727
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:17,008
I don't want to talk about that.

728
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:18,426
Oh, you don't want to talk about that?

729
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,596
I guess we were having a pretty good
conversation, we were really getting it going

730
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,015
and then you just don't want
to talk about it? Okay.

731
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,700
All right. Well, then I'm just
going to talk to the Millers then.

732
00:48:27,477 --> 00:48:28,603
Are you guys doing okay?

733
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:31,856
Can I get you, maybe,
a milkshake or a bowl of cereal?

734
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:41,491
Oh.

735
00:48:50,917 --> 00:48:52,085
Are you seeing this?

736
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:56,172
- You're the worst.
- What?

737
00:49:00,677 --> 00:49:02,554
- Oh!
- No!

738
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:05,307
- Oh, I love this song.
- I hate this song. Please.

739
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:07,726
- You hate this song? Who hates this song?
- Turn this off.

740
00:49:07,851 --> 00:49:09,185
Look. Even Ned loves this song.

741
00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:12,480
No. This song makes me think of my
parents when they go into their bedroom

742
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:14,691
to smoke weed and probably have sex.

743
00:49:14,774 --> 00:49:17,736
Your parents smoke weed?
Wow, that's really cool.

744
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:20,989
It's not cool. You probably only think
it's cool because your parents don't.

745
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:24,409
Yeah, but my parents are
dead, so they can't.

746
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:28,246
Oh, don't sweat it.
It happened a million years ago.

747
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:29,998
Mmm.

748
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:31,374
Parents.

749
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:33,877
- Did he just say "Parents"?
- It's the brains.

750
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:36,311
If he doesn't eat them, he gets smarter.

751
00:49:37,214 --> 00:49:38,799
I took Bio of the Undead last year.

752
00:49:39,717 --> 00:49:41,552
- Stupid parents.
- No, no.

753
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:44,889
His parents are kind of a sore subject.

754
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:47,914
I didn't know you guys were friends.

755
00:49:49,935 --> 00:49:51,437
Oh, I get it.

756
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:54,398
Like you used to be friends, right?

757
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:55,733
What happened?

758
00:49:57,985 --> 00:49:59,904
We just drifted apart.

759
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:01,864
Mmm-hmm.

760
00:50:01,947 --> 00:50:03,467
You got cool and decided to ditch him.

761
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:07,578
That's not what happened.
I wouldn't do that.

762
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:09,997
Well, at least you lucked out
in the parents department.

763
00:50:10,122 --> 00:50:13,084
I didn't luck out. My parents are insane.

764
00:50:13,584 --> 00:50:17,254
They're like perfect parents.
My dad's a child psychologist.

765
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:21,342
My mom's just a parent,
doesn't do anything but care about her son.

766
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:25,179
They do guitar duets and they want me
to sing along to them.

767
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:27,598
We make our own ice cream every Sunday.

768
00:50:27,682 --> 00:50:29,767
- We have to have family yoga on Saturdays.
- Pure hell.

769
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,060
- A lot of families do that.
- Yeah.

770
00:50:31,143 --> 00:50:32,895
- That's super normal.
- Oh.

771
00:50:32,978 --> 00:50:36,566
Boo-hoo.

772
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:40,612
- Oh, it's a joke?
- No. You were just listing beautiful things.

773
00:50:40,696 --> 00:50:43,365
You know something?
My parents are probably dead now, too.

774
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:52,791
I'm sorry.

775
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:56,169
No, I'm sorry.
I'm losing my mind in here a little bit.

776
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:58,338
- I've been in here way too long.
- I know.

777
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:01,592
Can I ask you a personal question?
How long can you go without blood?

778
00:51:01,676 --> 00:51:06,264
I have no idea. But hey, while we're
being honest with each other,

779
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:09,559
I should probably tell you, I keep
wondering why it is I don't just drink you.

780
00:51:09,684 --> 00:51:12,478
- Because I'll spear you in the tits.
- Yeah? He'll eat your brains.

781
00:51:12,645 --> 00:51:14,522
- Brains?
- Chill out! No.

782
00:51:15,064 --> 00:51:19,068
All right, look, we gotta go to my parents'
house and I want to see if they're alive.

783
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:21,654
I can't go anywhere until I eat.

784
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:24,240
Then we'll go to the high school.
It's on the way.

785
00:51:24,323 --> 00:51:26,993
We'll get food and we'll get blood there.
And then we'll go to my house.

786
00:51:27,076 --> 00:51:30,747
Okay, fine, great. So we do that
and your parents are alive. Then what?

787
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:33,750
There's still an alien apocalypse going on.

788
00:51:36,502 --> 00:51:40,214
Ned. Look, if we starve him of brains,
he'll get smarter.

789
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:42,508
So we stay alive long enough
for him to figure out

790
00:51:42,592 --> 00:51:45,595
how to get rid of these aliens
and save everybody's lives.

791
00:51:45,678 --> 00:51:47,263
That's a plan, right?

792
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:50,683
I mean, it's, uh... It's plan-ish.

793
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,401
- What do you see?
- Nothing. I think we're clear.

794
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:07,146
- What did you see?
- It's one of them. It's one of them.

795
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,076
- Okay, did he see you?
- Yeah. No.

796
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:12,538
Back door! Go, go!

797
00:52:13,414 --> 00:52:16,417
- No. Fuck, it's locked!
- Just use your vampire strength.

798
00:52:16,876 --> 00:52:18,961
Are you 12? There's no "vampire strength."

799
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,632
Okay. Go! Ned, come on!

800
00:52:24,425 --> 00:52:25,594
Okay.

801
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:28,055
- What?
- Oh, shit. I'm a vampire.

802
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:29,807
Whoa, whoa!

803
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,476
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

804
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:37,564
Cover your head. Cover up!

805
00:52:39,441 --> 00:52:42,236
Aliens.

806
00:52:42,736 --> 00:52:44,613
Aliens.

807
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:47,658
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

808
00:52:48,909 --> 00:52:51,119
Okay. Don't you wear underwear?

809
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:54,832
- Shut up. It bunches.
- Aliens!

810
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:57,584
Whatever happens, we meet back
at the high school, okay?

811
00:52:57,668 --> 00:52:58,961
Okay. Ned!

812
00:53:18,982 --> 00:53:20,191
Dag?

813
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:22,944
Dag?

814
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:24,988
Shit, he should have been here by now.

815
00:53:26,114 --> 00:53:28,199
Are you okay?

816
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,369
I think I might be having withdrawals.

817
00:53:32,036 --> 00:53:33,955
- Withdrawals from brains?
- Yeah.

818
00:53:34,122 --> 00:53:35,707
Ugh. That's messed up.

819
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:42,297
- Help! Open it!
- Oh, shit.

820
00:53:43,214 --> 00:53:46,009
Damn it. You scared the shit out of us.

821
00:53:46,843 --> 00:53:49,053
It's nice to see you, too.

822
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,640
Can I have my clothes back
before an alien spikes my asshole?

823
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:53,142
Yeah.

824
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,187
Ugh. I wish I would have had this earlier.

825
00:53:57,313 --> 00:54:01,692
So, what happened?
I thought maybe the aliens got you.

826
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:04,486
No, it was weird. They were all around me

827
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:07,907
but they just kept passing me by
like they couldn't see me.

828
00:54:18,042 --> 00:54:22,046
They couldn't see you
because you were naked, dumbass.

829
00:54:22,421 --> 00:54:23,589
What?

830
00:54:29,386 --> 00:54:32,681
It's highly likely their vision
can only detect inorganic matter.

831
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,601
That's my theory, anyway.

832
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:38,020
- Oh, Ned.
- We need to eat.

833
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:42,524
I've got to get me some brains.

834
00:54:43,692 --> 00:54:45,110
Now, what happened to you, Ned?

835
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,863
I mean, how does the smartest kid
in school get bitten by a zombie?

836
00:54:49,031 --> 00:54:51,200
It's pretty easy, actually.

837
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:53,285
You got bitten on purpose?

838
00:54:56,872 --> 00:54:58,707
Why would you do that?

839
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:01,418
You know, I used to worry
about everything, you know?

840
00:55:01,877 --> 00:55:04,129
Getting straight A's, my dad.

841
00:55:05,422 --> 00:55:07,383
Now I just slow my roll, you know?

842
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:10,803
You just threw it all away to space out?
That's weak.

843
00:55:11,553 --> 00:55:13,013
It's funny.

844
00:55:13,097 --> 00:55:17,686
We haven't talked in years.
Suddenly he gives a shit that I'm a zombie.

845
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:20,188
What was I supposed to do,
spend all of high school with you

846
00:55:20,271 --> 00:55:22,941
playing Minecraft
and hacking the school's servers?

847
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:25,276
Oh, as I recall, you thought hacking
was pretty cool!

848
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,904
Yeah, Minecraft
and freaking DoS attacks were cool!

849
00:55:27,988 --> 00:55:29,572
- Yeah, so cool.
- In seventh grade.

850
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:30,865
"We're hackers, Ned."

851
00:55:30,949 --> 00:55:34,744
But I'm not going to spend all of high school
getting my ass kicked in Loserville! All right?

852
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:37,580
Where are you going?

853
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:40,750
- Come on, don't be an asshole.
- You're an asshole!

854
00:55:42,503 --> 00:55:44,505
- I'm an asshole?
- Yeah.

855
00:55:49,093 --> 00:55:50,344
Asshole.

856
00:55:51,429 --> 00:55:52,638
What...

857
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:56,267
Dag?

858
00:55:58,352 --> 00:55:59,854
Dag, are you in here?

859
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:03,607
Hello?

860
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:06,444
Hey.

861
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:09,091
What are you doing in the old boiler?

862
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:11,532
Nothing.

863
00:56:12,658 --> 00:56:13,826
Okay.

864
00:56:16,454 --> 00:56:17,788
No, wait.

865
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:21,292
Great. Now we're both stuck in here.

866
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,294
- Aw.
- Cool.

867
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,631
- Is this funny to you?
- Yeah, a little.

868
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:32,094
I was coming in here to thank you,

869
00:56:32,178 --> 00:56:36,015
you know, for saving my life
back at the Millers'.

870
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:39,644
Well, you're welcome.

871
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:44,524
And...

872
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:49,029
I'm sorry for killing Lorelei.

873
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,452
Thank you.
I mean, what am I supposed to say to that?

874
00:56:55,535 --> 00:56:57,913
I don't know, Dag.
I'm trying my best here, okay?

875
00:56:57,996 --> 00:56:59,081
Okay.

876
00:56:59,164 --> 00:57:04,294
Hey, maybe you could admit that
Lorelei was sort of a raging bitch.

877
00:57:04,377 --> 00:57:07,547
Yeah, I mean, she was a little bit
of a bitch, but I really liked her.

878
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:09,883
I did.

879
00:57:10,342 --> 00:57:11,510
Fuck.

880
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:15,972
You know, while you were busy
really liking her,

881
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:17,933
she was busy really fucking my boyfriend.

882
00:57:21,061 --> 00:57:22,229
But she was a virgin.

883
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:24,898
Wow.

884
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,400
Yeah, that's perfect.

885
00:57:29,528 --> 00:57:32,364
So, Lorelei screws Milan
and ends up the coveted virgin,

886
00:57:32,447 --> 00:57:35,325
but I get bitten and I'm a slut for life.

887
00:57:35,408 --> 00:57:38,036
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.

888
00:57:38,787 --> 00:57:42,374
That's why I bit her, okay?
I saw her and I just snapped.

889
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:45,418
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I did and I'm sorry.

890
00:57:45,544 --> 00:57:46,920
Okay, okay.

891
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:52,884
I can't believe that I'm
that girl for eternity.

892
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:55,053
No, no, no. You're not.

893
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:00,642
You're not.

894
00:58:00,767 --> 00:58:01,977
I am.

895
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,736
It's dark in here.

896
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,159
It reminds me of
Greg Sheffler's laundry room.

897
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,121
So,

898
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,497
the only question is,
are you going to chicken out?

899
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,009
Ow.

900
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,931
- Okay.
- It will be all right.

901
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,102
- Wait, wait.
- What?

902
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,931
I've never done this before.

903
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,982
You mean the Titty Whisperer's a virgin?

904
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,275
So am I.

905
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,528
Don't say, "Really?"

906
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,113
I was going to say, "Really?"

907
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,870
Wait, wait.

908
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:02,122
Shh...

909
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,957
What's happening?

910
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,668
I did it. I did it. Oh, wait.

911
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,173
- Oh.
- Shh...

912
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:14,676
- I get you that excited?
- Yes.

913
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:17,554
Come here.

914
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,982
- Are we continuing?
- Oh, yeah.

915
00:59:30,526 --> 00:59:32,862
- Do you want me to do anything?
- No, just shut up.

916
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:48,211
What?

917
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,005
Did you get me?

918
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,840
No, I don't think I did.

919
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:56,177
No, no. It's okay.
I was scared I might have gotten...

920
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:58,674
- No, I would never do that.
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

921
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:01,182
- No, no. This was a mistake.
- Petra, I'm fine.

922
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:03,476
- No. You are a coward.
- Look, I'm fine.

923
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:04,686
- No!
- I'm fine!

924
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:07,021
Petra! Wait!

925
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,525
You could jump out this whole time?

926
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:14,737
She could jump out this whole time.
I'm such a dick.

927
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:18,116
- I totally agree.
- Ned?

928
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,203
Yeah. Wow. First guess.
Very impressive.

929
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:25,957
How much of that did you hear?

930
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:28,876
Just enough to know you're still a virgin.

931
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:32,046
Have fun being a virgin.

932
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:34,799
- Fuck off!
- All right.

933
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:39,595
Do you need me to get you some
clean underwear while I'm fucking off?

934
01:00:51,275 --> 01:00:53,653
Petra? Petra!

935
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,781
Petra. Hey.

936
01:00:57,824 --> 01:01:00,368
- Listen. Can we please talk?
- Don't touch me.

937
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:01,953
- Please.
- Look.

938
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:04,914
Yeah.
That's what I came to tell you guys.

939
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:08,418
It seems like they're searching
for something. We have to leave town.

940
01:01:08,501 --> 01:01:11,504
No. No, we're going
to my parents' house first.

941
01:01:11,796 --> 01:01:12,964
Wait.

942
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:16,468
The aliens can't find us
if they can't see us.

943
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:18,595
Right?

944
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,015
What?

945
01:01:33,109 --> 01:01:36,780
FYI, my dick is bigger than yours.

946
01:01:37,197 --> 01:01:40,200
- Come on, Ned. You're such a dick.
- Hmm.

947
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:42,285
We said we weren't going to look.

948
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,287
I lied.

949
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,624
Oh, great.

950
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,418
Okay, let's go.

951
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:52,128
Let's go, let's go. Run!

952
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,964
- Ned, come on! Come on!
- You guys, hurry!

953
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:57,717
Go, Petra.

954
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:01,805
Come on, come on.

955
01:02:05,975 --> 01:02:07,060
Mom?

956
01:02:09,187 --> 01:02:10,313
Dad?

957
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:13,983
Mom?

958
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,735
Dad?

959
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:16,987
Ah!

960
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,490
Mom, it's Dag!

961
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:22,410
Are you guys here?

962
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,078
Mom?

963
01:02:24,495 --> 01:02:26,330
Come out. Please come out.

964
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:36,173
- Do you hear that?
- Where?

965
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,342
The basement. Wait.

966
01:02:38,426 --> 01:02:39,885
Dad! Guys.

967
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:44,181
<i>But it appears
as if the alien forcefield,</i>

968
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:46,475
<i>in addition to blocking the town off
from all aid...</i>

969
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:47,685
I'm sure they're alive.

970
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:49,770
They're not. They're not.

971
01:03:09,457 --> 01:03:11,959
No! Ned! No!

972
01:03:26,099 --> 01:03:27,225
Are you all right?

973
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,401
No! Ned!

974
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:38,069
- Get out!
- Ned!

975
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:40,113
Ned!

976
01:03:41,157 --> 01:03:42,408
No!

977
01:03:47,246 --> 01:03:48,623
He's gone.

978
01:04:15,191 --> 01:04:18,277
He tried to save me. That's why he's dead.

979
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:20,446
I don't even have the guts
to talk to him at school

980
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,491
or help him out
when some asshole trips him.

981
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:26,202
Hey, come on. That's not your fault.

982
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,372
That's high school.

983
01:04:30,289 --> 01:04:31,374
No.

984
01:04:32,625 --> 01:04:34,210
You were right.

985
01:04:35,545 --> 01:04:38,297
We didn't just drift apart. I ditched him.

986
01:04:40,466 --> 01:04:43,469
His dad used to force
Ned to be on the team.

987
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:47,640
Back when he was trying
to mold him into a new Chaz Jr.

988
01:04:48,474 --> 01:04:51,477
And so Ned finds himself out there,

989
01:04:52,979 --> 01:04:56,148
deep left, last inning, last game.

990
01:04:56,983 --> 01:05:00,736
And I'm on the mound
and I serve up this meatball.

991
01:05:01,654 --> 01:05:04,031
And the kid hits the snot out of it.

992
01:05:04,156 --> 01:05:07,077
<i>It's like this thing has eyes
for where Ned's standing.</i>

993
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:10,998
<i>And right at the moment of truth,
it's about to hit Ned's glove</i>

994
01:05:11,582 --> 01:05:15,919
and boom, Chaz Jr. just obliterates him

995
01:05:16,587 --> 01:05:19,047
and grabs the ball like it's nothing.

996
01:05:19,172 --> 01:05:21,049
Game over. Mosely Auto wins.

997
01:05:22,593 --> 01:05:24,177
Everybody mobs Chaz Jr.

998
01:05:25,012 --> 01:05:27,556
And I remember looking out
into the outfield grass

999
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,601
and Ned's still there,

1000
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:33,895
just looking for his glasses.

1001
01:05:35,689 --> 01:05:38,025
That's the thing. He didn't...

1002
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:41,361
He never got a chance.

1003
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:44,615
It's not like he dropped it.
He never got a chance.

1004
01:05:44,698 --> 01:05:45,866
Yeah.

1005
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,878
I never really knew Ned
until he was a zombie.

1006
01:05:58,129 --> 01:05:59,797
But he was kind.

1007
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:02,425
And he was brave.

1008
01:06:04,052 --> 01:06:06,054
And he had a huge cock.

1009
01:06:10,308 --> 01:06:11,601
Ashes to ashes.

1010
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,479
We'll miss you, Ned.

1011
01:06:14,562 --> 01:06:17,148
Nice speech, douchebag.
I preferred Petra's.

1012
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:19,442
- Ned!
- Are you okay?

1013
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:21,736
Oh, my God! Sit down, here.

1014
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,989
- Shit. We thought you were dead.
- I wasn't dead.

1015
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:28,409
I was dematerialized and reassembled.

1016
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:30,120
Is everyone alive? Are my parents alive?

1017
01:06:30,245 --> 01:06:33,666
I don't know. You must have killed the alien
before it could send me to the right place.

1018
01:06:33,749 --> 01:06:35,084
So, instead of going
where everyone else went,

1019
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:37,252
I ended up at the Little
Caesars on Lakeview.

1020
01:06:37,336 --> 01:06:38,879
- What?
- What do we do now?

1021
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,757
We give the alien what they came for.

1022
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,759
Think about it.

1023
01:06:45,427 --> 01:06:49,598
Why would they pick Dillford?
What's the one thing our town's known for?

1024
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:51,517
You're around it every day.

1025
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,018
Wait, riblets?

1026
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,437
They flew a billion miles
for a great sandwich?

1027
01:06:55,771 --> 01:06:57,856
They want what's in the riblets.

1028
01:06:58,023 --> 01:07:00,651
- Little ribs?
- Tetrafluoraxipan.

1029
01:07:00,776 --> 01:07:01,777
What the hell is that?

1030
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:06,865
It's the chemical that Malphasta uses to
make horse cartilage taste like real meat.

1031
01:07:06,949 --> 01:07:09,451
- That's what they want.
- What? How are you so sure?

1032
01:07:09,535 --> 01:07:11,203
- Because look.
- Oh, my God.

1033
01:07:12,663 --> 01:07:15,874
Why is that so gross?
My face has been melting for a day.

1034
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,460
- There's pus. Ned!
- Oh, my God, that's horrible.

1035
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:20,170
- Oh, God.
- Ned, please put it away.

1036
01:07:20,295 --> 01:07:22,965
It's an allergic reaction
from when the alien grabbed me.

1037
01:07:23,048 --> 01:07:25,801
- And do you know what I'm allergic to?
- Tree nuts?

1038
01:07:26,135 --> 01:07:27,177
Dairy?

1039
01:07:27,302 --> 01:07:28,470
Ragweed?

1040
01:07:28,554 --> 01:07:29,596
Tarragon?

1041
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,682
Tetrafluoraxipan, guys.

1042
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,741
I thought I was spoon-feeding you, guys.

1043
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,686
- I really thought it was easy.
- Yeah.

1044
01:07:35,811 --> 01:07:39,565
Look, all we gotta do
is give the alien this chemical,

1045
01:07:39,898 --> 01:07:42,067
and they'll leave us alone.

1046
01:07:49,324 --> 01:07:51,702
Come on. Get over here.

1047
01:07:55,749 --> 01:07:58,168
<i>- Rick, are you there?
- Dougie, is that you?</i>

1048
01:07:58,752 --> 01:08:01,755
Yes. Rick, yes, it's Dag. Please let us in.

1049
01:08:01,838 --> 01:08:03,965
<i>How do we know it's not an alien
pretending to be him?</i>

1050
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:08,136
<i>I got it. What happened to you
at the Harvest Carnival five years ago?</i>

1051
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:09,721
Fucking hell.

1052
01:08:12,015 --> 01:08:14,392
I shit myself in the dunk tank.

1053
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:15,685
<i>What?</i>

1054
01:08:18,188 --> 01:08:20,774
I shit myself in the dunk tank!

1055
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:23,067
<i>Oh, it's him. Let him in.</i>

1056
01:08:24,195 --> 01:08:26,197
I thought you shit yourself
at your piano recital.

1057
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,699
It was a bad week, okay? Come on!

1058
01:08:31,619 --> 01:08:34,580
So, let me get this straight.
You're telling me that these aliens

1059
01:08:34,705 --> 01:08:36,791
can't see you if you're naked.

1060
01:08:38,209 --> 01:08:40,795
Then how did you three morons get here?

1061
01:08:40,878 --> 01:08:45,174
Well, these clothes are organic cotton,
so they're no different from our skin.

1062
01:08:45,257 --> 01:08:47,092
Right. I forgot your mom's a filthy hippie.

1063
01:08:47,218 --> 01:08:48,886
Your blood, darling.

1064
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:50,054
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1065
01:08:51,222 --> 01:08:53,222
Thank you. Will you check
on the zombie kid for me?

1066
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:55,693
Mmm-hmm. I will do that.

1067
01:08:56,227 --> 01:09:00,397
So, you ladies would have me believe
that a bunch of aliens packed themselves

1068
01:09:00,481 --> 01:09:04,819
into spaceships and flew a zillion miles
to Earth just to get some riblets.

1069
01:09:05,069 --> 01:09:06,570
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1070
01:09:06,737 --> 01:09:08,572
Did they say how much they would pay?

1071
01:09:08,989 --> 01:09:10,491
Rick, please.

1072
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:13,118
Just give them what they want.

1073
01:09:13,244 --> 01:09:16,789
You'd be a hero.
They'll probably make a statue out of you.

1074
01:09:16,914 --> 01:09:19,334
Do you realize the entire town
is being held captive somewhere?

1075
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:21,670
Probably having probes
shoved up their assholes.

1076
01:09:21,753 --> 01:09:23,797
Right. Statue.

1077
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:25,674
Mmm-hmm.

1078
01:09:25,757 --> 01:09:27,467
And meanwhile, Daisy and I are fine.
I wonder why.

1079
01:09:27,551 --> 01:09:30,470
Oh, that's right. Because we didn't run
into the middle of town with pitchforks,

1080
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:32,138
trying to brain our neighbors.
You know what?

1081
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,384
Those people are maniacs,
and as far as I'm concerned,

1082
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:36,192
the wider and deeper the
probes, the better.

1083
01:09:36,268 --> 01:09:37,853
Hey, those are my parents
you're talking about.

1084
01:09:37,936 --> 01:09:41,273
Well, I guess there's going to be shorter lines
at the Parker family bathroom this year.

1085
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:43,275
- What did you say?
- Oh, I think you heard me.

1086
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:45,026
You motherfucker!

1087
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:46,319
- Daisy!
- Hey!

1088
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:49,823
- Ned!
- Oh, fuck! Ned, no.

1089
01:09:50,657 --> 01:09:53,285
- Wait. No brains.
- You ate my Daisy, you fuck!

1090
01:09:53,618 --> 01:09:55,954
- Oh, dear God in heaven.
- Oh, shit.

1091
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:59,499
- God, we're really sorry, Rick.
- You're sorry? I loved this woman.

1092
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:01,585
Can we just talk? Oh!

1093
01:10:01,668 --> 01:10:03,295
Please! Don't do this!

1094
01:10:04,296 --> 01:10:05,797
We need help.

1095
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,302
- That's it.
- What?

1096
01:10:11,344 --> 01:10:12,512
Yeah.

1097
01:10:13,138 --> 01:10:14,639
I'm having an idea.

1098
01:10:14,973 --> 01:10:18,310
This isn't an idea. This is suicide.

1099
01:10:18,852 --> 01:10:21,646
Look, Ned did it and he's fine. Kind of.

1100
01:10:21,855 --> 01:10:25,358
If we hadn't killed that alien, it would
have sent him where it sent everybody else.

1101
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:26,818
Are you fucking insane?

1102
01:10:26,902 --> 01:10:29,529
The three of us alone can't do shit.

1103
01:10:30,322 --> 01:10:33,325
We need help. Come on, let's do this.

1104
01:10:35,493 --> 01:10:37,579
We're still a team, right?

1105
01:10:39,664 --> 01:10:41,291
Ugh. Let's do it now.

1106
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:46,547
I love you guys.

1107
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:57,267
Come and get it! Come and get it!

1108
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:13,367
Mom?

1109
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:16,912
Dag!

1110
01:11:17,245 --> 01:11:19,873
Petra. Oh, God! You look great.

1111
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,710
Look, let's not beat around the bush.
You've had blood.

1112
01:11:23,919 --> 01:11:26,296
- Hook a vampire up.
- Are you serious?

1113
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:29,424
Petra, please. Now's not the time
to get all periodic on me!

1114
01:11:31,551 --> 01:11:32,719
Thanks.

1115
01:11:34,304 --> 01:11:38,058
Go fuck yourself. And you were right.
Being a vampire isn't that bad.

1116
01:11:40,394 --> 01:11:41,561
Bitch.

1117
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,563
Son!

1118
01:11:45,065 --> 01:11:46,817
Son!

1119
01:11:50,612 --> 01:11:52,239
Dad?

1120
01:11:52,406 --> 01:11:55,993
Yes, Ned. It is I, your father!

1121
01:11:56,743 --> 01:11:58,245
I have been a terrible parent.

1122
01:11:58,745 --> 01:12:00,747
I never paid attention to you.

1123
01:12:00,831 --> 01:12:03,417
I blew your college fund on OxyContin.

1124
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,837
I don't even sell Hyundais. I sell Kias.

1125
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,756
Kias?!

1126
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,591
Shameful, I know.

1127
01:12:11,467 --> 01:12:12,593
Point is,

1128
01:12:13,302 --> 01:12:15,013
I've got major issues.

1129
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:20,184
But I love you. Now and forever.

1130
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:25,106
I love you too, dickwad.

1131
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:29,485
Mom?

1132
01:12:30,111 --> 01:12:31,279
Dad?

1133
01:12:32,321 --> 01:12:35,033
- Dag! Dag. Oh.
- Hey.

1134
01:12:35,116 --> 01:12:37,869
My sweet, little frowny clown.

1135
01:12:37,952 --> 01:12:41,581
Hey! Oh, you got all
that time-slime on you.

1136
01:12:41,664 --> 01:12:42,707
Wow.

1137
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:44,625
Oh, hey, look who we found.

1138
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:46,294
Lorelei.

1139
01:12:46,836 --> 01:12:49,964
Hi.
Oh, what the hell is that thing?

1140
01:12:50,465 --> 01:12:52,633
Ah, it's some kind of alien forcefield.

1141
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:55,678
It separates us from
the vampires and the zombies.

1142
01:12:55,803 --> 01:12:57,764
I call it the firewall.

1143
01:13:00,725 --> 01:13:03,061
At this point, fuck it, right?

1144
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:04,687
- Dag! Hey!
- Hey.

1145
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:06,189
- Petra.
- Oh.

1146
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,232
I haven't seen you since you murdered me.

1147
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,318
Yeah. Um...

1148
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:13,321
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

1149
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:16,991
No, don't apologize. I
mean, look at my tits.

1150
01:13:17,075 --> 01:13:19,660
- They're, like, twice the size now.
- God damn.

1151
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,163
- Ned! Hey, how are you doing, buddy?
- Ned!

1152
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:24,332
- Is that Ned Mosely?
- Oh.

1153
01:13:24,415 --> 01:13:26,918
- Oh, God, he looks terrible.
- Ooh.

1154
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,252
Okay, here's the deal.

1155
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,547
I don't care how messed up
these brains make you,

1156
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:34,511
I need you to think how we can
bring this thing, this forcefield, down.

1157
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,471
Help us get out of here, Ned,

1158
01:13:36,554 --> 01:13:38,765
so we can give them what they want
and get rid of them.

1159
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,892
Come on, Ned.
Come on, you can do it.

1160
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,019
<i>- You can do it, Ned.
- Push through.</i>

1161
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:53,321
Hurry up.

1162
01:13:53,404 --> 01:13:55,448
Just one more line of code.

1163
01:13:55,782 --> 01:13:56,866
Done.

1164
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:58,243
Wait, what just happened?

1165
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:00,370
No, no. Shut it down. Shut it down.

1166
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:02,747
Shut it down now.

1167
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:05,208
- You're awesome, Ned.
- Shut it down.

1168
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:07,418
Shut it down now!

1169
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:18,054
What?

1170
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:23,768
But why do they think he has the brains?

1171
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:26,771
He doesn't even seem like
he has any language skills.

1172
01:14:29,607 --> 01:14:31,484
Oh, that's not a word.

1173
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:37,866
- Sog attack?
- DoS attack!

1174
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:40,952
- DoS attack! DoS attack!
- DoS attack! DoS attack!

1175
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,204
This is what we used to do
back in junior high.

1176
01:14:43,288 --> 01:14:45,456
We used to overload the servers
to bring them down.

1177
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:47,500
We hit this thing together,
we'll short it out.

1178
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:49,502
- Yes!
- Are you nuts?

1179
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:53,006
Let the vampires do it.
They're so goddamn immortal!

1180
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:55,550
Oh, yeah, just like a human.

1181
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:58,762
Put it all on the undead. Pussies!

1182
01:14:58,846 --> 01:15:01,056
You're a pussy, bloodsucker!

1183
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,975
- You know what?
- Hey, hey. Everybody!

1184
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:07,438
What is it going to take for you idiots
to stop fighting and work together?

1185
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:12,026
Mr. Zimmerman, your daughter,
she's a vampire, right? And you love her?

1186
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,987
Yeah, you do. How could you not?

1187
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:18,699
Mrs. Franklin, your son is a zombie.

1188
01:15:18,782 --> 01:15:22,953
We've always known. Not a real doctor.
Let's quit pretending that he is.

1189
01:15:23,287 --> 01:15:25,039
All the aliens want

1190
01:15:26,165 --> 01:15:27,249
are the riblets.

1191
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:31,295
Now, I don't know about you.
I don't want to die in a Palway.

1192
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:34,924
If we just work together,
we can tear this wall down.

1193
01:15:35,007 --> 01:15:38,093
We will get out of here,
we'll convince Rick to open up the gates

1194
01:15:38,177 --> 01:15:40,638
and we'll save our shitty town!

1195
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:43,057
Now, what do you say?

1196
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:59,156
USA! USA!

1197
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,532
Whoo!

1198
01:16:02,244 --> 01:16:03,328
All right!

1199
01:16:04,162 --> 01:16:05,664
Is everyone ready?

1200
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:08,250
Three, two...

1201
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,085
Fuck it, just run!

1202
01:16:23,015 --> 01:16:24,058
Hey!

1203
01:16:24,517 --> 01:16:26,352
Let's get those riblets!

1204
01:16:26,852 --> 01:16:29,021
Come on! Come on, let's go!

1205
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:32,024
Rick! Rick!

1206
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,319
- Oh, shit.
- No, no!

1207
01:16:35,403 --> 01:16:38,197
The next asshole who steps closer
gets one in the chest!

1208
01:16:40,199 --> 01:16:42,910
We need you to give the aliens
the riblets! It's the only way!

1209
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:45,788
Isn't that nice?

1210
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:50,710
You know what? From day one, nobody
in this town ever involved me in anything.

1211
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:53,212
Not the bowling team, not the book club.

1212
01:16:53,296 --> 01:16:55,548
Shit, I paid for the
goddamn baseball field,

1213
01:16:55,631 --> 01:16:59,093
and I still can't get the drink I want
after the game at the bar.

1214
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:00,970
A Rick-itini's not a drink!

1215
01:17:02,054 --> 01:17:03,556
It is to me!

1216
01:17:03,639 --> 01:17:07,226
I deserve to belong, man.
I deserve to belong.

1217
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:09,061
Yes, you're right.

1218
01:17:09,812 --> 01:17:11,355
You do deserve to belong.

1219
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:14,279
I want to believe you, Diggie,
but I think you just want me to save you.

1220
01:17:14,817 --> 01:17:17,653
Do you want the truth? Here's the truth.

1221
01:17:18,571 --> 01:17:20,656
You have been a huge dick!

1222
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:23,743
But I've been one, too.

1223
01:17:26,245 --> 01:17:28,414
And we both deserve
to be a part of this town.

1224
01:17:28,956 --> 01:17:30,499
Rick! Rick!

1225
01:17:30,791 --> 01:17:33,294
Rick! Rick! Rick!

1226
01:17:33,419 --> 01:17:35,504
Rick! Rick! Rick!

1227
01:17:35,588 --> 01:17:36,964
Rick! Rick!

1228
01:17:37,089 --> 01:17:38,841
- Rick.
- Rick! Rick! Rick!

1229
01:17:38,966 --> 01:17:40,968
- Rick! Rick! Rick!
- Rick. Rick.

1230
01:17:41,093 --> 01:17:44,764
Come on, what's it going to be?
They're coming! We need you!

1231
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:47,100
All right.

1232
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:50,187
Bring it, fuckers!

1233
01:17:52,105 --> 01:17:53,106
Come on, come on.

1234
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:56,109
Come on, come on!
Everybody in! Everybody in!

1235
01:17:56,610 --> 01:17:59,112
- Go, go! Go! Come on!
- Run!

1236
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:10,374
Creatures from the great beyond,

1237
01:18:10,457 --> 01:18:12,709
behold the riblet!

1238
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,554
Ugh.

1239
01:18:24,638 --> 01:18:26,807
Jesus, that's what riblets are made of?

1240
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:30,185
How come no one ever told us?

1241
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,512
Oh, my God!

1242
01:19:10,519 --> 01:19:11,520
Ew.

1243
01:19:14,356 --> 01:19:15,732
- Ugh.
- Oh! Oh!

1244
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:24,032
What are you doing, aliens?

1245
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:26,702
Holy shit.

1246
01:19:28,454 --> 01:19:30,038
Wait, what's happening?

1247
01:19:33,876 --> 01:19:35,085
What is going on?

1248
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:38,589
He was wrong!
Your genius zombie friend was wrong!

1249
01:19:38,964 --> 01:19:41,383
They took our riblets
and now they're going to kill us all!

1250
01:19:49,725 --> 01:19:54,229
Beings of Earth, do not
cower in fear. Rise.

1251
01:19:54,938 --> 01:19:56,231
It's...

1252
01:19:56,648 --> 01:19:57,691
beautiful.

1253
01:19:57,774 --> 01:20:00,194
As our planet's ambassador,

1254
01:20:00,277 --> 01:20:03,989
we would like to thank you
for giving us a precious chemical

1255
01:20:04,072 --> 01:20:05,616
that sustains us.

1256
01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:08,952
- Why does it have a German accent?
- I was going to ask the same question.

1257
01:20:09,244 --> 01:20:10,746
But before we go,

1258
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:14,124
we need to talk about what happened here.

1259
01:20:14,249 --> 01:20:18,670
We came all this way
to essentially borrow a stick of butter.

1260
01:20:18,754 --> 01:20:21,840
And before we even got a chance to ask,

1261
01:20:21,924 --> 01:20:23,717
you went bananas.

1262
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,470
We had to lock you all up in the Palway

1263
01:20:26,595 --> 01:20:29,431
just to protect you from yourselves.

1264
01:20:29,765 --> 01:20:34,312
As one of your great philosophers
so eloquently put it,

1265
01:20:35,438 --> 01:20:39,817
"We didn't start the fire."

1266
01:20:41,277 --> 01:20:43,488
"It was always burning."

1267
01:20:43,613 --> 01:20:47,116
"Since the world's been turning."

1268
01:20:47,325 --> 01:20:50,870
"But when we are gone,
will it still burn on,"

1269
01:20:50,954 --> 01:20:53,623
"and on and on?"

1270
01:20:53,706 --> 01:20:54,791
You are fucking kidding me.

1271
01:20:54,874 --> 01:20:57,877
- But that's a song.
- It's a song about burning.

1272
01:20:58,336 --> 01:21:00,672
Here is the point. Look at us.

1273
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:04,175
We are 90 feet of
intergalactic awesomeness.

1274
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,179
- Look at you. You guys are a mess.
- Huh?

1275
01:21:07,304 --> 01:21:10,474
Have some dignity, for shit's sake.

1276
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,142
And you're welcome.

1277
01:21:12,226 --> 01:21:13,811
Hey, wait a second.

1278
01:21:13,894 --> 01:21:15,020
Yes?

1279
01:21:15,729 --> 01:21:16,981
Fuck you.

1280
01:21:17,064 --> 01:21:18,440
- Oh, whoa.
- No, no, no.

1281
01:21:18,524 --> 01:21:20,609
You come here in your ship,

1282
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:22,570
you scare the living piss out of us,

1283
01:21:22,653 --> 01:21:26,031
and then you lecture us
with a Billy Joel song?

1284
01:21:26,156 --> 01:21:31,078
But our research indicated an abiding love
for Billy Joel.

1285
01:21:33,247 --> 01:21:34,290
Freak.

1286
01:21:34,373 --> 01:21:37,167
Please, let's keep this civilized.

1287
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,919
Ow!

1288
01:21:39,003 --> 01:21:41,672
- What the fuck?
- She's right!

1289
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:45,426
Go fuck with somebody else's planet,
you self-righteous douchebag. Fuck you!

1290
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:50,889
Fine. Have it your way, bitches.

1291
01:22:22,088 --> 01:22:23,728
- Are you all right?
- What is that stuff?

1292
01:22:24,883 --> 01:22:26,051
Ammonia!

1293
01:22:26,134 --> 01:22:29,512
The ammonia's melting it!
Ammonia! That's it!

1294
01:22:29,596 --> 01:22:31,973
Mrs. Mosely, the ammonia hose! Quick!

1295
01:22:32,057 --> 01:22:35,268
Way ahead of you, Daggy! Let her rip, boys!

1296
01:22:53,662 --> 01:22:57,415
You uppity little bitch, I've done
a lot of slumming in my life, but you...

1297
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:01,419
You might be my biggest disgrace.

1298
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:02,754
Yeah!

1299
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:12,555
<i>When you really care
about somebody, you don't hesitate.</i>

1300
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:14,015
<i>You just jump right in.</i>

1301
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:15,183
Don't touch her!

1302
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:26,112
Ahh!

1303
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,286
In a way, I envy you.

1304
01:23:34,954 --> 01:23:36,872
About to see a world I'll never know.

1305
01:23:53,974 --> 01:23:56,309
<i>When the change comes, it is...</i>

1306
01:23:57,352 --> 01:24:00,897
<i>- Enormous.
- Enormous. It's a big change.</i>

1307
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:02,399
<i>Wow.</i>

1308
01:24:15,829 --> 01:24:16,997
No.

1309
01:24:31,344 --> 01:24:33,388
I said, "Don't touch her."

1310
01:24:37,517 --> 01:24:39,019
No!

1311
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:49,280
It's sticking out of my back, isn't it?

1312
01:24:49,363 --> 01:24:50,406
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:55,787
Are you okay?

1314
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:01,626
- Did you hear that?
- It's him.

1315
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,128
Our boy is growing up.

1316
01:25:20,728 --> 01:25:22,104
Oh, shit.

1317
01:25:32,657 --> 01:25:33,783
Fuck this.

1318
01:25:56,138 --> 01:25:58,057
What the hell is that?

1319
01:25:58,140 --> 01:26:00,518
Sub-atomic fusion explosive.

1320
01:26:01,018 --> 01:26:03,271
Parting gift, motherfuckers.

1321
01:26:51,404 --> 01:26:52,488
Ned! Ned!

1322
01:26:59,495 --> 01:27:01,414
Give him the high cheese, Diggy!

1323
01:27:10,214 --> 01:27:12,675
Wait, that's not supposed to happen.

1324
01:27:51,215 --> 01:27:57,054
<i>There's a time to remember,
a time to forget.</i>

1325
01:27:57,137 --> 01:28:01,892
<i>The world out there, just shoot her down
No time for the quit.</i>

1326
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,896
- Guess who.
- Lorelei.

1327
01:28:06,563 --> 01:28:08,732
- Yo, Dag, what's up?
- Yo, what's up, man?

1328
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:11,652
Look at you. Hey, you want to eat
at my table today?

1329
01:28:11,944 --> 01:28:14,613
Um, I'd love to,
but I kind of got some other plans.

1330
01:28:15,447 --> 01:28:18,784
Oh, well, that's cool, because maybe
after school, we could hang...

1331
01:28:19,785 --> 01:28:21,620
Uh, nothing. I'll just...

1332
01:28:22,246 --> 01:28:23,580
- Hi.
- Hey.

1333
01:28:24,248 --> 01:28:25,874
Should we go find Ned?

1334
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:28,502
No, it looks like
he's bonding with Chaz Jr. today.

1335
01:28:33,257 --> 01:28:34,425
Oh.

1336
01:28:34,633 --> 01:28:36,343
That is my thigh.

1337
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:50,942
So, what should we do?

1338
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:53,069
I don't know.

1339
01:28:53,153 --> 01:28:54,779
Maybe we should

1340
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:56,281
make out under the bleachers.

1341
01:28:56,614 --> 01:28:57,615
Huh.

1342
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,452
Bring it, fucker.

1343
01:29:01,787 --> 01:29:03,456
I am so into you.

1344
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:12,715
<i>I don't care about tomorrow
when I feel like this today.</i>

1345
01:29:13,966 --> 01:29:15,509
So, who are you these days?

1346
01:29:17,136 --> 01:29:19,555
I'm Nick Braun.

1347
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:23,350
What do they look like?
Is it like Spielberg or more Giger?

1348
01:29:23,476 --> 01:29:24,852
Who the fuck is Giger? I don't know.

1349
01:29:24,977 --> 01:29:27,480
<i>H.R. Giger. He designed
the aliens in Alien.</i>

1350
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:30,441
Who's pitching it to me?

1351
01:29:30,524 --> 01:29:32,401
<i>Did you ever see the
movie Schindler's List?</i>

1352
01:29:32,651 --> 01:29:34,695
You know,
he wanted to save all these people...

1353
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:36,822
Save all these lives
that were worth saving, right?

1354
01:29:37,073 --> 01:29:39,366
Well, you're like my opposite Schindler.

1355
01:29:39,492 --> 01:29:41,494
This is really going to fuck you up.

1356
01:29:42,995 --> 01:29:44,413
I dropped my weapon. Hold on.

1357
01:29:44,497 --> 01:29:46,832
Are you ready to give up yet?

1358
01:29:46,916 --> 01:29:48,417
Say it more like you're choking.

1359
01:29:48,501 --> 01:29:51,837
I am choking, though.
That's why it's hard to say this shit.

1360
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:04,850
- We're "understanding" parents.
- Yeah. Right.

1361
01:30:05,226 --> 01:30:07,603
- You do the other quote.
- Yeah, all right.

1362
01:30:07,686 --> 01:30:09,939
You guys understand too much.

1363
01:30:10,022 --> 01:30:13,834
Maybe a little too much some days.
When we have to drive.

1364
01:30:13,859 --> 01:30:17,162
We should all do it
sometime together or something.

1365
01:30:17,196 --> 01:30:19,698
- Oh, no. Not important to do that.
- No.

1366
01:30:19,782 --> 01:30:21,900
- It's a... Yeah.
- Generational.

1367
01:30:21,951 --> 01:30:24,986
What, did I stutter?

1368
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:26,540
No! - A little bit.

1369
01:30:26,623 --> 01:30:29,608
You did stutter a little bit.

1370
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:33,863
My jaw is half gone.
Way to make fun of me.

1371
01:30:33,922 --> 01:30:38,784
- I didn't mean that. Sorry.
- Class act, this guy.

1372
01:30:38,852 --> 01:30:41,137
It's not going to get better,
so just... - Got it.

1373
01:30:41,138 --> 01:30:44,098
I'm going to take a key.
I'm going to stick it in my mouth,

1374
01:30:44,099 --> 01:30:45,641
and I'm going to turn it
and I'm going to lock it.

1375
01:30:45,642 --> 01:30:47,434
- But you're still talking.
- Yep.

1376
01:30:47,435 --> 01:30:51,063
<i>No-one can stop ya
if you truly believe</i>

1377
01:30:51,064 --> 01:30:56,527
<i>lt just fixiate to cut you
There's no place for the weak.</i>

1378
01:30:56,528 --> 01:31:01,949
<i>People sad collect dodges
Wait for someone to break.</i>

1379
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:07,104
<i>It's all right, it's okay.</i>

1380
01:31:07,105 --> 01:31:13,085
<i>You can be anytime you want to.</i>

1381
01:31:13,086 --> 01:31:18,341
<i>Take your time, walk away.</i>

1382
01:31:18,342 --> 01:31:24,515
<i>You can come back
if you're supposed to.</i>

1383
01:31:59,468 --> 01:32:31,999
<i>It's all right, it's okay.
It's all right, it's okay.</i>

1384
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,300
<i>It's all right...</i>
