1
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,449
What's happening?

2
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,952
- Why are you taking a bath?
- I'm not.

3
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:40,330
Shit.

4
00:01:43,126 --> 00:01:45,753
We got to find a way out.
Everybody, come on.

5
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:49,506
Where are you?

6
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,225
Papa!

7
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,943
It's okay. It's just another earthquake.

8
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm right here.

9
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:55,698
Right here. Okay.

10
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,680
The clocks stopped at 1:17.

11
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:23,518
There was a long shear of bright light,

12
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,771
then a series of low concussions.

13
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:36,823
I think it's October,

14
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:40,577
but I can't be sure.

15
00:03:41,495 --> 00:03:43,955
I haven't kept a calendar for years.

16
00:03:49,753 --> 00:03:52,797
Each day is more gray than the one before.

17
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,178
It is cold and growing colder
as the world slowly dies.

18
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:03,349
No animals have survived,
and all the crops are long gone.

19
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,107
Soon all the trees in the world will fall.

20
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:22,536
The roads are peopled
by refugees towing carts

21
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:24,955
and gangs carrying weapons,

22
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:28,042
looking for fuel and food.

23
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,025
Within a year, there were fires on the ridges

24
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:54,985
and deranged chanting.

25
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:04,245
There has been cannibalism.

26
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,206
Cannibalism is the great fear.

27
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:17,299
Mostly I worry about food, always food.

28
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,095
food and the cold and our shoes.

29
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:40,781
Sometimes I tell the boy old stories
of courage and justice,

30
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,951
difficult as they are to remember.

31
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,497
All I know is the child is my warrant,

32
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:53,253
and if he is not the word of God,
then God never spoke.

33
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:26,995
"...flea, you could land
on Lady Liberty's torch.

34
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:31,708
"If you flicked your tongue like a chameleon,

35
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,502
"you could whip the food off your plate

36
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,379
"without using your hands.

37
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,883
"But what would your mother say?

38
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:42,345
"If you craned your neck like a crane,

39
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:45,765
"you'd have to stretch your arm way up

40
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,267
"to scratch your head.

41
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:55,107
"If you had eagle eyes,
you could spot a running rabbit."

42
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,011
Let's take a look.

43
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:23,697
There could be something here.
Corn or something.

44
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:25,574
No.

45
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,035
They ran out of food.

46
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:40,005
Maybe there's some hayseeds in the hayloft.

47
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,382
I doubt it.

48
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,733
It's not what you think.

49
00:09:00,735 --> 00:09:02,694
They committed suicide.

50
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:04,571
Why?

51
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,073
You know why.

52
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:30,097
Two left. One for you, one for me.

53
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,948
You put it in your mouth
and you point it up,

54
00:09:48,116 --> 00:09:50,076
just like I showed you.

55
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,869
Okay.

56
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,955
- Like this.
- No.

57
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:58,417
Then just pull the trigger.

58
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,002
You got it?

59
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:04,632
Is that okay?

60
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,968
Okay.

61
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,163
Are you hungry?

62
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,041
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

63
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:42,420
- I'm thirsty.
- Thirsty? Some water?

64
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,088
Okay. Hey.

65
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,009
You look pretty.

66
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:01,940
Oh, no.

67
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:10,741
No.

68
00:11:19,709 --> 00:11:21,668
No, we don't have to do this.

69
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:24,546
- I don't want to do this.
- I think we do.

70
00:11:24,922 --> 00:11:26,632
No, I don't want to do this.

71
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,759
What kind of life is this?

72
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:31,136
You got to push.

73
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,512
No.

74
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:33,889
Come on,

75
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:37,809
push.

76
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:25,816
Quick! Get up!

77
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:36,285
We got to run. Go. Stay low. Go, go.

78
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:40,206
- Papa. Papa.
- Let's go.

79
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,690
Check those junkers over there.

80
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,608
Shit.

81
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,370
Where's your head?

82
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:54,363
- Watch the damn cars up ahead.
- Jog along beside them.

83
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:00,745
Damn it.

84
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:06,042
Don't look at them. Look at me.

85
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,086
You call out, you're dead.

86
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:11,214
Where you from?

87
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,174
Does it matter?

88
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:15,510
Where you from?

89
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:19,223
You got ammunition for those rifles?

90
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,851
I told you not to look over there.

91
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,485
What are you eating?

92
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,403
Whatever we can find.

93
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,572
Whatever you can find.

94
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:36,990
Yeah.

95
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,044
You ain't gonna shoot that thing.

96
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:53,298
You ain't got but two shells. Maybe one.

97
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:57,594
- And they'll hear the shot.
- Maybe, but you won't,

98
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:04,184
because it'll be through your skull and
inside your brain before you can hear it.

99
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,395
To hear it, you'll need a frontal lobe

100
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:10,023
and things with names like colliculus
and temporal gyrus,

101
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:13,986
but you won't have them anymore
because they'll just be soup.

102
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,029
You a doctor?

103
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,156
I'm not anything.

104
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:21,410
We got a hurt man. It'd be worth your while.

105
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,039
You look at him again
and I'll shoot you in the head.

106
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:29,376
That boy looks hungry.
Why don't y'all come on to the truck?

107
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,545
Get you something to eat.

108
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:34,965
Ain't no need to be such a hard-ass.

109
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,719
You don't have anything to eat.

110
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:41,638
Come on. Let's go.

111
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,099
I ain't going nowhere.

112
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:46,685
You think I won't kill you?

113
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:50,731
You're wrong.

114
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,816
You know what I think?

115
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:55,819
I think you're chicken-shit.

116
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:58,989
You never killed a man in your life.

117
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:13,546
- Where'd that come from?
- Right there!

118
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:14,839
Who's shooting?

119
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,355
Let's go. Come on.

120
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,858
- At the tree line!
- Come on!

121
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,741
- The two of you, that way.
- Move quicker.

122
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:43,993
- Move!
- I think I see him. Let's go!

123
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,837
Over there!

124
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:19,780
You're okay. I'm right here.

125
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:24,243
Let's go.

126
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:55,275
I try to look like any common traveling killer,

127
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,279
but my heart is hammering.

128
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,324
When it comes to the boy,

129
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,953
I have only one question.

130
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:11,249
Can you do it

131
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,128
when the time comes?

132
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,384
All right?

133
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:26,264
I won't let anything happen to you.

134
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:28,391
I'll take care of you.

135
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:37,817
And I'll kill anyone who touches you,

136
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,655
because that's my job.

137
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,023
You got to stop crying.

138
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,400
We got to go now.

139
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:22,612
We got to go find the cart.

140
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:30,704
Come on.

141
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:33,999
Take the gun.

142
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:29,763
That's all we have left.

143
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,268
I should've done it a long time ago.

144
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:35,936
I should've done it
when we had more bullets.

145
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,606
I don't know why I listened to you.

146
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:44,111
They're gonna catch up with us
and they're going to kill us.

147
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:49,283
They're gonna rape me,
and then they're gonna rape your son

148
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:52,119
and they're gonna kill us and eat us.

149
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:54,413
- Whatever it takes...
- Stop it.

150
00:20:54,497 --> 00:20:56,498
- I told you...
- Stop it!

151
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:01,462
I will do anything. Anything.

152
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:05,132
Like what?

153
00:21:11,974 --> 00:21:15,310
I don't even know why I ask you.
I should just go ahead

154
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:18,939
and empty every goddamn bullet
into my brain and leave you with nothing.

155
00:21:19,023 --> 00:21:23,068
- That's what I should do.
- Please don't talk like that.

156
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:30,450
You're right.
There's nothing left to talk about.

157
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,374
My heart was ripped out of me
the night he was born.

158
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,215
We have to. We will survive this.

159
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,970
We are not gonna quit.
We're not gonna quit.

160
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:55,558
I don't want to just survive.

161
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:58,478
Don't you get it?

162
00:21:59,355 --> 00:22:01,064
I don't want to.

163
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:08,989
Why won't you let me take him with me?

164
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,075
Don't touch it.

165
00:22:14,537 --> 00:22:18,456
I would take him with me
if it weren't for you. You know that.

166
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:20,875
Listen to yourself.

167
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:24,921
You sound

168
00:22:27,758 --> 00:22:29,175
crazy.

169
00:22:51,825 --> 00:22:54,076
Other families are doing it.

170
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:27,401
Let's go take a bath.

171
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:06,107
Listen,

172
00:24:07,109 --> 00:24:08,818
we have to talk.

173
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:13,322
That man back there...

174
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,162
There's not many good guys left, that's all.

175
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:25,000
We have to watch out for the bad guys.
We have to just

176
00:24:26,253 --> 00:24:28,587
keep carrying the fire.

177
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:35,345
What fire?

178
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:38,557
The fire inside you.

179
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,026
Are we still the good guys?

180
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:52,529
Yes, we're still the good guys.

181
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,781
Of course we are.

182
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:57,534
And we always will be?

183
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,579
No matter what happens?

184
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:04,332
Always will be.

185
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,067
What is it?

186
00:25:33,404 --> 00:25:35,238
It's a treat for you.

187
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:48,919
Go ahead.

188
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:13,151
It's really good.

189
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:17,156
- You should have some.
- No, you drink it.

190
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:20,618
I want you to have some.

191
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:24,872
It's bubbly.

192
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:40,763
It's for you.

193
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:52,483
Come on.

194
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,238
I'm coming.

195
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,861
I'm hungry.

196
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,363
I know. So am I.

197
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,370
And we're still heading south?

198
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,623
Of course.

199
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,293
There might be food there.

200
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:54,838
Everything depends
on reaching the coast, okay?

201
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,009
Okay.

202
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,478
I wish I was with my mom.

203
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,862
You mean you wish you were dead?

204
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,615
Yeah.

205
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,748
You mustn't say that. It's a bad thing to say.

206
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,587
I can't help it.

207
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:37,423
You have to stop thinking about her.

208
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,760
We both do.

209
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,100
How do we do that?

210
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,865
You did it right. You did it right.

211
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,167
Aren't you at least
gonna say goodbye to him?

212
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,836
- No.
- No?

213
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,589
No.

214
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:25,009
- Why not?
- I can't.

215
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:29,097
Why can't you stay till morning?

216
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:34,394
Because I can't.

217
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:36,521
Can't you spend one more night with me?

218
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,565
- No, I have to go.
- Why?

219
00:31:40,693 --> 00:31:42,694
Why do you have to go?

220
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:46,281
Why? Why do you have to go?

221
00:31:54,456 --> 00:32:03,882
What am I gonna tell him?

222
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,266
God.

223
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:14,893
You go south.

224
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:16,311
No.

225
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:19,314
You keep him warm and you go south.

226
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,652
You won't survive another winter here.

227
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,330
Why won't you help me?

228
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:39,584
Where are you going?
You can't even see out there.

229
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,337
I don't need to. I don't need to see.

230
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,759
- I'm begging...
- Don't.

231
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,053
- Please.
- No.

232
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,347
Don't.

233
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:01,731
She was gone,

234
00:33:03,276 --> 00:33:06,236
and the coldness of it was her final gift.

235
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:11,367
But she died somewhere in the dark.

236
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:16,664
There is no other tale to tell.

237
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:37,851
Look, there's colors.

238
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,609
You want to go in?

239
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,575
I got you!

240
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,610
Come on.

241
00:34:57,975 --> 00:34:59,142
Papa.

242
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,588
There's a reason this is locked.

243
00:36:02,206 --> 00:36:03,873
Come help me.

244
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:19,556
Nothing's gonna happen.

245
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,907
It's okay.

246
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:55,593
What's that?

247
00:37:04,186 --> 00:37:05,686
Oh, my God.

248
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,232
Help us. Please, will you help us?

249
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:15,988
- Help us.
- Let's go! Let's go!

250
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:18,783
Help me.

251
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,535
Wait! Wait!

252
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:24,122
They're taking us to the smokehouse.

253
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,125
Go, go!

254
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:30,337
- Stop!
- Wait!

255
00:37:36,093 --> 00:37:38,136
No. No. No!

256
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:40,388
No.

257
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,847
Bad guys. Bad men.

258
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:26,060
Bad men. Bad guys.

259
00:38:29,648 --> 00:38:31,607
Who left this window open?

260
00:38:31,692 --> 00:38:34,235
- I leave it open for the smell.
- What smell?

261
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:36,737
- You don't smell it anymore?
- Who wants a drink?

262
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,239
Don't waste the wine.

263
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:48,791
Yeah, it's gonna keep raining.
It's gonna rain all day.

264
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,002
I'm going up to change.

265
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,838
They're bad guys.

266
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:55,548
Bad guys.

267
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,883
- Take it.
- No. No.

268
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,719
- Take it! Take it. Take it.
- No.

269
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,471
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

270
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:09,395
When they get hold of you, you're gonna
have to do it just like everybody else.

271
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:15,234
You have to be brave. You have to!
You know how to do it.

272
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,611
- You know how.
- Be right up.

273
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:19,655
Bad guys. Bad men.

274
00:39:24,786 --> 00:39:26,620
What are you doing?

275
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:30,207
I'm so sorry.

276
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,629
Will I see you again?

277
00:39:36,548 --> 00:39:39,175
When will I see you? No.

278
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,926
What's going on?

279
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,970
What the hell is that?

280
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:44,430
Hey!

281
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,604
Fuck!

282
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:54,358
He was out of the cellar. I pushed it over.

283
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:56,943
God damn it.

284
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:02,574
- Come on!
- Where do you think you're going?

285
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:06,388
- Hey, hold him.
- I got him!

286
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:09,683
You son of a bitch!

287
00:41:28,035 --> 00:41:29,953
Hey, come on. Wake up.

288
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,372
Wake up. Wake up.

289
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,959
We got to get out of here.

290
00:41:35,043 --> 00:41:37,712
- We got to go now. We got to get away.
- Get off me.

291
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,213
Come on.

292
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:42,550
Let's run.

293
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:51,851
Last one.

294
00:42:07,576 --> 00:42:10,411
We would never eat anybody, would we?

295
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,916
No, of course not.

296
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:20,630
No matter how hungry we were?

297
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:25,259
Even if we were starving?

298
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,553
We're starving now.

299
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:31,432
Because we're the good guys.

300
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,519
Yes.

301
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:37,396
And we're carrying the fire.

302
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:43,986
Yes.

303
00:43:01,296 --> 00:43:02,713
This way.

304
00:43:07,803 --> 00:43:09,845
What is this place, Papa?

305
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:14,058
The house where I grew up.

306
00:43:29,993 --> 00:43:31,493
That's me.

307
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:43,422
This is where we used to have
our Christmas tree when I was a boy.

308
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:55,434
And here's where we'd hang our stockings.

309
00:44:00,106 --> 00:44:01,273
It's...

310
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:14,411
I don't think we should be doing this.

311
00:44:26,507 --> 00:44:28,592
You want to wait outside?

312
00:46:08,652 --> 00:46:10,027
No, wait!

313
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:12,113
- Hey!
- Wait!

314
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:15,867
Wait! Come on!

315
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:19,036
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Hey. Hey.

316
00:46:21,373 --> 00:46:22,749
- What are you doing?
- No.

317
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,333
What are you doing?

318
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,377
- What are you doing?
- What?

319
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:29,297
- There's a little boy, Papa!
- What little boy? What are you...

320
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:31,132
- I saw a little boy!
- What the hell are you doing?

321
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:32,800
I saw a little boy.

322
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:36,012
- There's no boy. What boy?
- Get off. There is! Just like me.

323
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:38,556
- Come on.
- No!

324
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:40,433
Hey!

325
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:44,104
- Stop it! You scared the hell out of me.
- No!

326
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:46,982
- Come on, let's go. Stop it.
- I need to see him!

327
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:49,109
Hey! What the hell...

328
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:52,029
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

329
00:46:53,865 --> 00:46:55,199
- I need to!
- Why?

330
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:56,867
I just do!

331
00:46:58,411 --> 00:46:59,578
Stop it.

332
00:46:59,662 --> 00:47:01,288
He's right there.

333
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:03,040
I understand.

334
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,543
- I understand. It's okay.
- Right there.

335
00:47:10,715 --> 00:47:12,382
It's gonna be all right.

336
00:47:25,438 --> 00:47:28,565
He imagines how things will be at the coast,

337
00:47:29,734 --> 00:47:33,029
and that there will be other children there.

338
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:35,907
He asks me what happened to my friends,

339
00:47:35,991 --> 00:47:39,911
and I tell him they died and that I miss them.

340
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,127
When I have nothing else,

341
00:47:48,629 --> 00:47:51,923
I try to dream the dreams
of a child's imaginings.

342
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,696
Are we gonna die now?

343
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,372
What do you think is gonna happen?

344
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:28,460
You think we're just gonna
suddenly keel over and die?

345
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,754
It takes a long time

346
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,757
to die of starvation.

347
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,957
Every day is a lie,

348
00:49:08,043 --> 00:49:10,127
but I am slowly dying.

349
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:12,546
That is not a lie.

350
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,969
I'm trying to prepare him
for the day when I'm gone.

351
00:49:34,027 --> 00:49:36,570
Nothing you haven't seen before.

352
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:53,106
Papa!

353
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:58,903
- What?
- Papa.

354
00:50:59,113 --> 00:51:00,613
What's wrong?

355
00:51:01,615 --> 00:51:02,782
Look.

356
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:06,536
We look skinny.

357
00:51:08,372 --> 00:51:09,956
We are skinny.

358
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,295
Come on. Let's get out of here.

359
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:46,826
Your mother played really well.

360
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,747
I don't remember.

361
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,375
Well, that was

362
00:51:54,086 --> 00:51:55,252
before.

363
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,881
- Don't.
- It's okay.

364
00:52:41,716 --> 00:52:43,300
Please, Papa.

365
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:44,927
Please.

366
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:48,305
It's okay.

367
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,192
Oh, my God.

368
00:53:02,237 --> 00:53:03,821
Come down here.

369
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,450
Come down.

370
00:53:08,535 --> 00:53:10,286
What did you find?

371
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:12,079
Everything.

372
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:14,915
I found everything.

373
00:53:28,013 --> 00:53:29,931
What is all this stuff?

374
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,850
Food.

375
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:34,519
It's food.

376
00:53:35,771 --> 00:53:38,732
Here. See? Can you read the label?

377
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,278
"Pears."

378
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,655
Yes, pears.

379
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:56,374
What do you want for breakfast?

380
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:17,020
What?

381
00:54:17,146 --> 00:54:20,315
Nothing.

382
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:23,318
Is it okay for us to take all this?

383
00:54:25,071 --> 00:54:26,071
Yeah.

384
00:54:26,614 --> 00:54:27,781
They'd want us to.

385
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,621
Shouldn't we thank them?

386
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:36,331
Yeah, go ahead.

387
00:54:43,756 --> 00:54:45,173
Like this?

388
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,887
Thank you for

389
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:53,473
soup

390
00:54:54,016 --> 00:54:56,351
and Cheetas.

391
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,062
Cheetos.

392
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:01,690
And all this stuff,

393
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:03,608
people.

394
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:08,363
That's good.

395
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:10,907
Your turn.

396
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:19,333
Thank you, people.

397
00:56:01,543 --> 00:56:03,044
You like that?

398
00:56:10,135 --> 00:56:12,428
We did good, didn't we, Papa?

399
00:56:14,765 --> 00:56:15,931
Yeah.

400
00:56:26,443 --> 00:56:34,784
Go to sleep.

401
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:00,516
What?

402
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:04,228
Don't...

403
00:59:06,272 --> 00:59:08,106
Don't touch my stuff.

404
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,068
Okay, sorry.

405
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:44,393
Now I'll give you a treat.

406
00:59:44,477 --> 00:59:46,853
- What?
- Keep your eyes closed.

407
00:59:46,938 --> 00:59:48,480
How does that feel?

408
00:59:48,565 --> 00:59:51,316
Shampoo.

409
00:59:54,988 --> 00:59:56,238
Better?

410
00:59:57,156 --> 00:59:58,282
Yep.

411
01:00:26,145 --> 01:00:27,687
How do I look?

412
01:00:33,027 --> 01:00:34,819
What do you think?

413
01:00:57,134 --> 01:00:58,718
Can I try some?

414
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:02,180
- Why?
- You won't like it.

415
01:01:06,185 --> 01:01:08,019
Makes you feel funny.

416
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:18,571
You okay?

417
01:01:27,414 --> 01:01:30,583
You think I come from another world,
don't you?

418
01:01:35,673 --> 01:01:36,923
Sort of.

419
01:01:47,976 --> 01:01:49,519
What was that?

420
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,360
It sounded like a dog.

421
01:02:08,623 --> 01:02:10,290
It's not a dog.

422
01:02:12,335 --> 01:02:13,544
It is.

423
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,630
It is a dog.

424
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:19,466
If it's a dog,

425
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:23,011
it'll be with someone.

426
01:02:23,596 --> 01:02:24,680
But who?

427
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,392
I don't know.

428
01:02:29,436 --> 01:02:31,812
I'm not waiting to find out.

429
01:02:31,896 --> 01:02:33,313
- Come on.
- No, I don't want to go.

430
01:02:33,398 --> 01:02:35,399
It's not safe here anymore.

431
01:02:35,483 --> 01:02:37,443
- But...
- We're going.

432
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:42,781
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

433
01:02:42,866 --> 01:02:45,492
We'll just have to take what we can.

434
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:49,121
You always think bad things
are gonna happen.

435
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:51,248
But we found this place.

436
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,089
Blankets on the cart.

437
01:03:07,974 --> 01:03:09,433
I see him.

438
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:40,589
I don't have anything for you.

439
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:42,758
You can look if you want.

440
01:03:43,344 --> 01:03:45,220
I got nothing.

441
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:46,971
We're not robbers.

442
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:48,223
What?

443
01:03:52,478 --> 01:03:54,646
I said we're not robbers.

444
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:56,481
Well, what are you?

445
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:58,441
We're just like you.

446
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:02,195
- Well, what are you following me for?
- We're not following you.

447
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:06,449
- We've got food we could give him.
- He's not getting any food.

448
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:09,619
- He's scared, Papa.
- Everybody's scared.

449
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:13,164
Please, Papa.

450
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:16,626
All right.

451
01:04:17,545 --> 01:04:18,920
Just one.

452
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:31,933
Here,

453
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:33,726
take it.

454
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:44,904
- What about a spoon?
- He's not getting a spoon.

455
01:04:49,577 --> 01:04:50,660
You

456
01:04:52,371 --> 01:04:53,663
pull it.

457
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:56,791
You got to

458
01:04:58,085 --> 01:04:59,878
eat it. It's good.

459
01:05:17,187 --> 01:05:18,688
He's hungry.

460
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:20,940
I see it.

461
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:25,988
And I know what you're gonna ask me,
and the answer is no.

462
01:05:27,115 --> 01:05:28,908
What's the question?

463
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:32,494
We can't keep him.

464
01:05:48,053 --> 01:05:50,512
You want to have dinner with us?

465
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:55,601
I don't know. What do I have to do?

466
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,354
You don't have to do anything.

467
01:05:58,438 --> 01:06:01,357
- Can you walk okay?
- Yeah, I can.

468
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:04,777
- Help him.
- You help him.

469
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:06,695
I can't.

470
01:06:06,988 --> 01:06:08,405
I can walk.

471
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,532
No, I can walk.

472
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,214
How old are you?

473
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,091
I'm 90.

474
01:06:28,093 --> 01:06:29,843
Ninety, my ass.

475
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,805
Is that what you tell people
so they don't hurt you?

476
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:37,685
- Does it work?
- Nope.

477
01:06:42,357 --> 01:06:44,066
What's your name?

478
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,694
- Ely.
- "Ely"?

479
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,321
What's wrong with Ely?

480
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:51,323
Don't hold his hand.

481
01:07:18,102 --> 01:07:21,396
That little boy, is he your little boy?

482
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,524
Your son?

483
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:27,819
- Yeah.
- What's it look like?

484
01:07:28,195 --> 01:07:30,905
I don't know. I can't see real good.

485
01:07:33,534 --> 01:07:35,535
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

486
01:07:38,205 --> 01:07:39,831
Can you see me?

487
01:07:39,915 --> 01:07:42,625
No, but I can tell somebody's there.

488
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:44,919
Yeah.

489
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:50,050
- Okay.
- Good little boy. Yeah.

490
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,761
- Okay, time for you to go to sleep.
- No.

491
01:07:52,845 --> 01:07:54,012
Yes.

492
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:56,347
- Good night.
- Good night.

493
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:59,393
- Good night.
- Go to sleep.

494
01:07:59,478 --> 01:08:01,270
Good night, son.

495
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:12,406
You can see that, can't you?

496
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:14,617
Yeah.

497
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,585
When I saw that boy,

498
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:30,007
I thought I'd died and he...

499
01:08:30,842 --> 01:08:32,551
He was an angel.

500
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:36,055
I had a boy one time

501
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:38,641
of my own.

502
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:50,779
I never thought I'd see a child again,
never thought that would

503
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,781
happen to me.

504
01:08:53,491 --> 01:08:55,117
He is an angel.

505
01:08:56,786 --> 01:08:58,578
To me, he's a god.

506
01:09:01,415 --> 01:09:03,625
But I hope that's not true.

507
01:09:04,585 --> 01:09:07,921
To be on the road with the last god like that

508
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:11,216
would be nothing

509
01:09:14,011 --> 01:09:16,179
but a dangerous situation.

510
01:09:20,518 --> 01:09:22,644
What happened to your son?

511
01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:31,153
I can't talk about it.

512
01:09:34,824 --> 01:09:37,159
Not with you, anyway.

513
01:09:49,922 --> 01:09:53,383
I knew this was coming,
this or something like it.

514
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:55,802
There were warnings.

515
01:09:57,638 --> 01:10:01,433
Yeah, some people thought it was a con.
I always believed in it.

516
01:10:02,518 --> 01:10:03,518
Yeah.

517
01:10:03,603 --> 01:10:07,022
- Did you try to get ready for it?
- What would you do?

518
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:10,775
Even if you knew what to do,
you wouldn't know what to do.

519
01:10:11,152 --> 01:10:12,819
But supposing

520
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:19,534
you were the last man left alive?

521
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:26,082
How would you know that,
that you were the last man alive?

522
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:29,586
Well, I don't guess you'd know it.
You'd just be it.

523
01:10:36,553 --> 01:10:38,387
Maybe God would know.

524
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:40,973
God wouldn't know what...

525
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:44,477
God wouldn't know what he knows.

526
01:10:44,937 --> 01:10:49,315
If there is a God up there, he would
have turned his back on us by now.

527
01:10:49,775 --> 01:10:53,903
And whoever made humanity
will find no humanity here.

528
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:56,656
No, sir. No, sir.

529
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,741
So beware.

530
01:10:59,576 --> 01:11:00,826
Beware.

531
01:11:02,537 --> 01:11:04,872
Do you ever wish you would die?

532
01:11:05,874 --> 01:11:06,999
No.

533
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:10,795
It's foolish to ask for luxuries
in times like these.

534
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,056
- He's gonna die and you don't care.
- I care enough.

535
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,187
Maybe when we run out of food,
you'll have more time to think about it.

536
01:11:28,605 --> 01:11:32,024
Yeah, well, you always say,
"Watch out for bad guys."

537
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:36,779
That old man wasn't a bad guy.
You can't even tell anymore.

538
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:52,003
That'll keep it safe.

539
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:56,215
- Do you know where we are?
- About 100 miles from the coast,

540
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,050
as the crow flies.

541
01:11:58,844 --> 01:12:00,678
"As the crow flies"?

542
01:12:02,055 --> 01:12:05,349
It means going in a straight line,

543
01:12:05,434 --> 01:12:06,809
which we can't.

544
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:09,312
There aren't any crows, are there?

545
01:12:09,396 --> 01:12:12,481
- Just in books.
- Yep, just in books.

546
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:16,236
Do you think
there could be crows somewhere?

547
01:12:16,321 --> 01:12:18,280
I think it's unlikely.

548
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:21,575
Could they fly to Mars or someplace?

549
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,413
You know what? Let's go back.

550
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:41,595
What is it?

551
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:47,601
Let's go. Let's go. Run. Run.

552
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:56,360
Go! Go!

553
01:12:58,946 --> 01:13:00,989
No. No!

554
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:02,282
Let's go.

555
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:05,035
- No!
- Let's go. Let's go. Run.

556
01:13:38,945 --> 01:13:40,654
Hey! Hey! Hold on!

557
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:42,155
Stop!

558
01:13:45,827 --> 01:13:47,160
In there!

559
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,496
Keep your head down!

560
01:14:08,267 --> 01:14:10,476
It's okay. It's okay.

561
01:14:13,188 --> 01:14:14,647
- It's okay.
- No!

562
01:14:15,357 --> 01:14:16,816
It's okay.

563
01:14:25,367 --> 01:14:26,951
It's gone now.

564
01:15:59,128 --> 01:16:01,004
I had a bad dream.

565
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:16,270
Stop.

566
01:16:21,901 --> 01:16:24,987
I tell him, "When you dream
about bad things happening,

567
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:28,657
"it shows you're still fighting.
You're still alive.

568
01:16:30,451 --> 01:16:33,453
"It's when you start
to dream about good things

569
01:16:33,538 --> 01:16:36,123
"that you should start to worry."

570
01:16:41,504 --> 01:16:42,921
Here?

571
01:16:43,006 --> 01:16:44,047
No,

572
01:16:44,882 --> 01:16:47,050
we're closer than you think.

573
01:16:49,178 --> 01:16:50,554
That's us,

574
01:16:51,764 --> 01:16:53,807
and this is all the sea.

575
01:16:57,854 --> 01:16:59,021
This?

576
01:17:01,941 --> 01:17:03,358
Is it blue?

577
01:17:04,652 --> 01:17:06,028
The sea?

578
01:17:06,904 --> 01:17:08,488
I don't know,

579
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:10,616
used to be.

580
01:17:38,896 --> 01:17:40,021
Wait.

581
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:59,540
I'm sorry it's not blue.

582
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:11,219
We'll be all right.
We'll just keep heading south.

583
01:18:15,517 --> 01:18:17,601
What's on the other side?

584
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:22,606
Nothing.

585
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:27,152
There has to be something.

586
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:30,030
Maybe there's a father

587
01:18:31,282 --> 01:18:34,952
and his little boy,
and they're sitting on a beach, too.

588
01:18:47,632 --> 01:18:49,133
You all right?

589
01:18:49,217 --> 01:18:51,468
- What is it? What is it?
- I don't feel too...

590
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:54,138
Jesus!

591
01:18:56,599 --> 01:18:58,308
You're burning up.

592
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,231
Sorry.

593
01:19:03,315 --> 01:19:05,984
It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.

594
01:19:11,282 --> 01:19:18,913
I'm right here.

595
01:19:26,672 --> 01:19:28,757
Can I ask you a question?

596
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,426
Of course.

597
01:19:36,807 --> 01:19:39,017
What would you do if I died?

598
01:19:45,191 --> 01:19:46,649
If you died,

599
01:19:49,487 --> 01:19:51,446
I'd want to die, too.

600
01:19:53,866 --> 01:19:55,950
So you could be with me?

601
01:19:56,035 --> 01:19:57,160
Yeah,

602
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,121
so I could be with you.

603
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:24,229
What are you doing?

604
01:20:25,564 --> 01:20:27,190
I'm going out to that boat.

605
01:20:27,274 --> 01:20:28,817
What are you gonna do?

606
01:20:28,901 --> 01:20:31,027
See what I can find for us.

607
01:20:33,948 --> 01:20:36,574
Here. You keep a good lookout.

608
01:20:37,952 --> 01:20:39,202
Okay?

609
01:20:40,329 --> 01:20:41,454
Okay.

610
01:20:42,581 --> 01:20:43,915
Stay warm.

611
01:22:01,703 --> 01:22:03,954
Hey! What the hell happened?

612
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:07,625
- I'm sorry!
- They took everything!

613
01:22:08,168 --> 01:22:09,543
Our food,

614
01:22:11,087 --> 01:22:12,463
my shoes.

615
01:22:15,008 --> 01:22:16,634
Son of a bitch!

616
01:22:18,845 --> 01:22:20,930
- It's okay. Listen, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

617
01:22:21,014 --> 01:22:22,348
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to.

618
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:23,599
- It's okay.
- I fell asleep.

619
01:22:23,683 --> 01:22:25,976
Listen, don't lose heart.
We're gonna get it back.

620
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:09,270
Get away from the cart. Put the knife down.

621
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:11,898
Fuck you. I ain't putting down shit.

622
01:23:15,027 --> 01:23:18,238
- God damn you.
- Papa, please don't kill the man!

623
01:23:18,781 --> 01:23:20,073
Please.

624
01:23:28,249 --> 01:23:29,666
All right.

625
01:23:33,379 --> 01:23:35,588
All right, I done what you said.

626
01:23:35,673 --> 01:23:37,841
- Please, Papa.
- Listen to the boy.

627
01:23:37,925 --> 01:23:39,509
- How long you been following us?
- Following you?

628
01:23:39,593 --> 01:23:42,429
- How long?
- Nobody been fucking following you.

629
01:23:42,513 --> 01:23:46,725
I saw the cart in the sand, just took it,
that's all. I ain't touch the boy.

630
01:23:46,809 --> 01:23:48,351
- Take your clothes off.
- No.

631
01:23:48,436 --> 01:23:51,771
- Take them off! Every goddamn stitch.
- You don't want to do this.

632
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:54,649
- Do it.
- All right. All right. All right.

633
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:57,527
- Just take it easy.
- I'll kill you.

634
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:59,612
Right where you stand.

635
01:24:00,281 --> 01:24:02,323
I don't want no trouble.

636
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:12,835
Please, mister.

637
01:24:15,630 --> 01:24:17,715
You ain't got to do this.

638
01:24:24,473 --> 01:24:27,641
And the shoes. Throw them in the cart.

639
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:31,353
Throw them in the cart!

640
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:37,568
Do it.

641
01:24:44,367 --> 01:24:46,577
You ain't got to do this to me, man.

642
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,829
You ain't got to do me like this.

643
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:51,248
- You didn't mind doing it to us.
- I'm begging.

644
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:52,374
- I'm begging, please.
- Papa!

645
01:24:52,459 --> 01:24:54,460
Listen to the boy, man.

646
01:24:54,753 --> 01:24:56,337
I is starving.

647
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:59,590
You'd have done the same thing.

648
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:01,383
I'll die out here.

649
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:05,596
I'm gonna die out here, man.

650
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,682
I'm gonna leave you just the way you left us.

651
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:12,561
Help me pull the cart.

652
01:25:12,646 --> 01:25:14,188
Pull the cart!

653
01:25:16,066 --> 01:25:18,609
What do you think would've happened
if we hadn't caught him?

654
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:20,861
- You've got to learn.
- I don't want to learn!

655
01:25:20,946 --> 01:25:23,656
I'm not gonna be around forever!

656
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,618
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to look after yourself.

657
01:25:27,702 --> 01:25:30,037
Help me with the goddamn cart!

658
01:25:46,763 --> 01:25:48,848
Would you stop sulking?

659
01:25:50,058 --> 01:25:51,433
He's gone.

660
01:25:53,104 --> 01:25:55,147
- He's not gone.
- What do you want me to do?

661
01:25:55,231 --> 01:25:57,065
Just help him, Papa.

662
01:25:58,568 --> 01:26:00,110
Just help him.

663
01:26:00,736 --> 01:26:02,404
He's just hungry.

664
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:05,824
He's gonna die.

665
01:26:05,908 --> 01:26:07,909
He's gonna die anyway.

666
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:10,662
He was so scared.

667
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:13,748
I'm scared. You understand?

668
01:26:14,417 --> 01:26:15,834
I'm scared.

669
01:26:19,088 --> 01:26:22,382
You're not the one that has to worry
about everything.

670
01:26:22,466 --> 01:26:23,758
I am so.

671
01:26:24,385 --> 01:26:26,678
What? What'd you say?

672
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:29,347
Yes, I am!

673
01:26:32,602 --> 01:26:34,227
I am the one!

674
01:26:37,106 --> 01:26:38,273
Okay?

675
01:26:51,871 --> 01:26:53,079
Okay.

676
01:26:53,164 --> 01:26:54,789
Help me push.

677
01:26:58,127 --> 01:27:04,299
Hello?

678
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,537
Papa.

679
01:28:16,707 --> 01:28:19,917
- What? What do you got there?
- Look.

680
01:28:20,669 --> 01:28:23,129
- What is it?
- It's a beetle.

681
01:28:24,756 --> 01:28:25,966
Look.

682
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:33,932
Get down!

683
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,480
Papa!

684
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,232
Son of a bitch!

685
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,370
No. No! Papa!

686
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:22,106
Cock-sucking motherfucker!

687
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:24,817
Who else is here?

688
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:27,028
You piece of shit!

689
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,696
Why are you following us?

690
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:31,115
We weren't following anybody.

691
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,744
You were following us.

692
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:24,043
Right there.

693
01:30:27,256 --> 01:30:29,382
Right there. Right there.

694
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:33,678
Fuck.

695
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:12,759
Wait.

696
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:28,734
No.

697
01:31:37,243 --> 01:31:39,161
We have to leave it.

698
01:31:41,206 --> 01:31:43,123
I can't do it anymore.

699
01:32:15,156 --> 01:32:16,823
jlf jl were God,

700
01:32:18,368 --> 01:32:20,994
I would've made the world just so,

701
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:24,790
and no different.

702
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:31,296
And so I have you.

703
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:39,054
I have you.

704
01:33:43,162 --> 01:33:57,133
You're okay.

705
01:33:57,843 --> 01:34:00,219
Don't get too comfortable here.

706
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:02,930
You need to keep going.

707
01:34:06,935 --> 01:34:09,687
You don't know
what might be down the road.

708
01:34:09,772 --> 01:34:10,980
No.

709
01:34:11,231 --> 01:34:13,650
No, you're gonna be okay, Papa.

710
01:34:13,734 --> 01:34:16,903
- You have to.
- This has been a long time coming.

711
01:34:21,742 --> 01:34:24,370
Just keep... Just keep going south.

712
01:34:27,123 --> 01:34:29,583
Do everything the way we did it.

713
01:34:30,543 --> 01:34:32,044
Keep the gun

714
01:34:32,712 --> 01:34:34,380
with you, always.

715
01:34:35,757 --> 01:34:38,258
Don't let anyone take it from you.

716
01:34:42,222 --> 01:34:46,725
You need to find the good guys,
but you can't take any chances.

717
01:34:47,936 --> 01:34:49,436
You hear me?

718
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:53,607
But I want to be with you.

719
01:34:55,944 --> 01:34:58,112
I want to be with you, too,

720
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:00,197
but I can't.

721
01:35:00,615 --> 01:35:03,283
You have to... You have to let me go.

722
01:35:04,119 --> 01:35:05,244
No.

723
01:35:06,371 --> 01:35:08,580
Just take me with you,

724
01:35:09,332 --> 01:35:10,624
please.

725
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:15,879
I thought I could.

726
01:35:17,632 --> 01:35:19,675
- Please, Papa.
- I can't do it.

727
01:35:19,801 --> 01:35:21,552
What should I do?

728
01:35:21,636 --> 01:35:23,762
Just hold my hand.

729
01:35:28,518 --> 01:35:30,936
You said you wouldn't leave me.

730
01:35:34,274 --> 01:35:35,566
I know.

731
01:35:37,902 --> 01:35:39,361
I'm sorry.

732
01:35:43,908 --> 01:35:45,325
Oh, my boy.

733
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:47,369
My boy.

734
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:53,125
You have my whole heart.

735
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:57,421
You always did.

736
01:36:38,798 --> 01:36:39,923
Papa.

737
01:36:45,304 --> 01:36:46,429
No.

738
01:36:49,517 --> 01:36:56,439
Papa.

739
01:39:23,965 --> 01:39:26,383
Where's that man you were with?

740
01:39:35,477 --> 01:39:37,228
Is he your father?

741
01:39:38,522 --> 01:39:41,023
Yes, he was my papa.

742
01:39:41,566 --> 01:39:44,318
I think maybe you should come with me.

743
01:39:49,574 --> 01:39:51,742
Are you one of the good guys?

744
01:39:51,827 --> 01:39:54,870
Yeah, I'm one of the good guys.
Why don't you put that pistol away?

745
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:59,000
I'm not supposed to let anyone
take it from me, no matter what.

746
01:39:59,084 --> 01:40:03,337
I don't want your pistol,
I just don't want you pointing it at me.

747
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,103
You see, you got two choices here.

748
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:23,774
You can stay here with your papa
or you can go with me.

749
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:28,779
If you stay here,
you need to keep off the road.

750
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:36,245
How do I know you're one of the good guys?

751
01:40:36,329 --> 01:40:39,331
You don't. You'll just have to take a shot.

752
01:40:46,965 --> 01:40:48,841
Do you have any kids?

753
01:40:50,427 --> 01:40:51,886
Yes, we do.

754
01:40:54,556 --> 01:40:56,640
Do you have a little boy?

755
01:40:57,350 --> 01:41:00,144
We have a little boy and a little girl.

756
01:41:00,812 --> 01:41:02,104
How old is he?

757
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:04,940
About your age, maybe a little older.

758
01:41:07,319 --> 01:41:09,403
And you didn't eat them?

759
01:41:09,905 --> 01:41:11,113
No.

760
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:14,367
So, you don't eat people?

761
01:41:14,452 --> 01:41:16,536
No, we don't eat people.

762
01:41:19,832 --> 01:41:20,999
And

763
01:41:22,460 --> 01:41:24,544
are you carrying the fire?

764
01:41:25,338 --> 01:41:26,713
Am I what?

765
01:41:27,173 --> 01:41:28,924
Carrying the fire.

766
01:41:33,137 --> 01:41:35,388
You're kind of weirded out, aren't you, kid?

767
01:41:35,473 --> 01:41:37,349
Well, are you?

768
01:41:38,351 --> 01:41:40,519
Yeah, I'm carrying the fire.

769
01:41:41,521 --> 01:41:43,563
And I can come with you?

770
01:41:44,148 --> 01:41:45,690
Yes, you can.

771
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:08,964
I'll talk to you every day.

772
01:42:13,052 --> 01:42:14,928
And I won't forget,

773
01:42:16,848 --> 01:42:18,515
no matter what.

774
01:42:25,690 --> 01:42:27,607
No matter what, Papa.

775
01:42:57,389 --> 01:42:59,307
I'm so glad to see you.

776
01:43:01,185 --> 01:43:03,936
We were following you. Did you know that?

777
01:43:05,564 --> 01:43:07,690
We saw you with your papa.

778
01:43:10,444 --> 01:43:12,111
I'm so lucky.

779
01:43:17,534 --> 01:43:19,702
I was so worried about you,

780
01:43:20,162 --> 01:43:23,206
and now we don't have to worry
about a thing.

781
01:43:25,167 --> 01:43:27,627
How's that sound? Is that okay?

782
01:43:45,145 --> 01:43:46,479
Okay.
