not because he wanted to, you understand,

Sick Boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher

and was here, he said,
to mix business and pleasure,

So he just uses more smack, for the pain.

And then he has a stroke. A fucking stroke.

and dies three weeks later.

on top of that armed robbery shit,

he was going down for 15 to 20.

he didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.791
So, how much would you like for this?

1021

I don't think it's worth much more than 15.

RENTON: This was a real drag to him.
He didn't need to negotiate.

1025
01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.120
What the fuck were we going to do with it
if he didn't buy it?

1026
01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.914
Sell it on the streets? Fuck that.

1027
01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.915
-Well, 19.
-Terribly sorry, I can't go to 19.

Well, fucking 16 then.

1029
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:53.593
Okay. Well, fucking 16 it is then.

1030
01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.752
These, gentlemen, are £2,000 bundles.

1031
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:03.793
That's two.

1032
01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.712
That's four.

1033
01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.150
RENTON: We settled on £16,000.

1034
01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.557
He had a lot more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.

1036
01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.474
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1037
01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:25.319
I'd just like to say it's been a pleasure
haggling with you.

RENTON: And just for a moment
it felt really great.

1044
01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.310
Like we were all in it together,
like friends, like it meant something.

1045
01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.915
A moment like that,
it can touch you deep inside.

1046
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.152
But it doesn't last long. Not like £16,000.

1047

I'm going to get something for my ma,

-No, man, true love. True love.
