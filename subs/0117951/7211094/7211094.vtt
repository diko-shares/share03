00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.240
<i>Choose life. Choose a job.</i>

2
00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:37.443
<i>Choose a career. Choose a family.</i>

3
00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.245
<i>Choose a fucking big television.</i>

4
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:44.121
<i>Choose washing machines, cars,
compact disc players, electrical tin openers.</i>

5
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.718
<i>Choose good health,
low cholesterol and dental insurance.</i>

6
00:00:57.808 --> 00:01:00.175
<i>Choose fixed-interest mortgage repayments.</i>

7
00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.018
<i>Choose a starter home.</i>

8
00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:03.310
<i>Choose your friends.</i>

9
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:06.852
<i>Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.</i>

10
00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:10.810
<i>Choose a three-piece suite on
hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.</i>

11
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.113
<i>Choose DIY and wondering who the fuck
you are on a Sunday morning.</i>

12
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:15.189
<i>Choose sitting on that couch</i>

13
00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.651
<i>watching mind-numbing,
spirit-crushing game shows</i>

14
00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:20.369
<i>stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.</i>

15
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.086
Tommy, go!

16
00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:31.164
<i>Choose rotting away
at the end of it all,</i>

17
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.044
<i>pissing your last in a miserable home,</i>

18
00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:35.968
<i>nothing more than an embarrassment
to the selfish, fucked-up brats</i>

19
00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.965
<i>that you've spawned to replace yourself.</i>

20
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:40.093
<i>Choose your future. Choose life.</i>

21
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.982
<i>But why would I want to do
a thing like that?</i>

22
00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:58.992
<i>I chose not to choose life.
I chose something else. And the reasons?</i>

23
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.695
<i>There are no reasons.</i>

24
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.948
<i>Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?</i>

25
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.962
<i>Goldfinger</i> is better than <i>Dr. No.</i>

26
00:02:20.724 --> 00:02:23.887
Both of them are a lot better
than <i>Diamonds Are Forever.</i>

27
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.346
A judgement reflected in its relatively
poor showing at the box office.

28
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:34.565
And in which field, of course,
<i>Thunderball</i> was a notable success.

29
00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:40.237
<i>People think it's all about misery
and desperation and death, and all that shite</i>

30
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.909
<i>which is not to be ignored.</i>

31
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.986
Fuck off! Jealous cunt.

32
00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:48.745
<i>But what they forget
is the pleasure of it.</i>

33
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:51.494
They're all dead, right, mate?

34
00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.497
You prick!

35
00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:58.379
<i>Otherwise we wouldn't do it.</i>

36
00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:01.928
- Do you want me to do it?
- Yeah.

37
00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.594
Pure as the driven snow, that shit, Danny.

38
00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:14.355
<i>After all, we're not fucking stupid.
Or at least we're not that fucking stupid.</i>

39
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.124
<i>Take the best orgasm you ever had,
multiply it by a thousand</i>

40
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.747
<i>and you're still nowhere near it.</i>

41
00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.629
It beats any meat injection.

42
00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:42.212
That beats any fucking cock in the world.

43
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:45.886
<i>When you're on junk,
you have only one worry, scoring.</i>

44
00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:50.311
<i>When you're off it, you're suddenly obliged
to worry about all sorts of other shite.</i>

45
00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:53.731
<i>Got no money, can't get drunk.
Got money, drinking too much.</i>

46
00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:57.685
<i>Can't get a girl, no chance of a ride.
Got a girl, too much hassle.</i>

47
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.903
<i>You have to worry about bills, about food,</i>

48
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.106
<i>about some football team
that never fucking wins,</i>

49
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.943
<i>about human relationships, and all
the things that really don't matter</i>

50
00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.372
<i>when you've got
a sincere and truthful junk habit.</i>

51
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.952
I'd say, in those days,
he was a muscular actor.

52
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.295
With all the presence
of someone like Cooper or Lancaster,

53
00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:21.796
but combined with a sly wit

54
00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:26.218
to make him a formidable romantic lead

55
00:04:26.892 --> 00:04:29.850
and closer in that respect to Cary Grant.

56
00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.992
<i>The only drawback,
or at least the principal drawback,</i>

57
00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:56.919
<i>is that you have to endure
all manner of cunts telling you...</i>

58
00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.918
No way would I poison my body
with that shit.

59
00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:03.679
All them fucking chemicals.

60
00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:06.845
No fucking way.

61
00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:13.311
It's a waste of your life, man,
poisoning your body with that shit.

62
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.768
Every chance you've had, Son,
you've blown it.

63
00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.729
Stuffing your veins with that filth.

64
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:23.487
<i>From time to time,
even I have uttered the magic words.</i>

65
00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.490
Never again, Swanney. I'm off the skag.

66
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.279
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:35.909
- No more. I'm finished with that shite.
- Well, that's up to you, man.

68
00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:36.993
Gonna do it right this time,

69
00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.703
gonna get it sorted out, get off it for good.

70
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:42.131
- I'm sure I've heard that one before.
- The Sick Boy method.

71
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:46.631
- It really worked for him, eh?
- He's always been lacking in moral fibre.

72
00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:50.301
- He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
- That's hardly a substitute.

73
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.016
You need one more hit.

74
00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:56.266
- No, I don't think so.
- For the long night that lies ahead.

75
00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:01.350
<i>We called him Mother Superior
on account of the length of his habit.</i>

76
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:04.779
<i>Of course I'd have another shot.
After all, I had work to do.</i>

77
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.506
<i>Relinquishing junk.
Stage one, preparation.</i>

78
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:31.969
<i>For this you will need one room,
which you will not leave.</i>

79
00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:35.643
<i>Soothing music. Tomato soup, ten tins of.</i>

80
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.602
<i>Mushroom soup, eight tins of,
for consumption cold.</i>

81
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:46.525
<i>Ice cream, vanilla, one large tub of.
Magnesia, milk of, one bottle.</i>

82
00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:51.321
<i>Paracetamol, mouthwash,
vitamins, mineral water, Lucozade,</i>

83
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.736
<i>pornography.</i>

84
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.662
<i>One mattress.</i>

85
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.492
<i>One bucket for urine,
one for faeces, and one for vomitus.</i>

86
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.250
<i>One television and one bottle of Valium,</i>

87
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.923
<i>which I've already procured
from my mother, who is,</i>

88
00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.298
<i>in her own domestic and socially
acceptable way, also a drug addict.</i>

89
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.470
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

90
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.302
<i>All I need is one final hit to soothe the pain</i>

91
00:07:18.396 --> 00:07:20.649
<i>while the Valium takes effect.</i>

92
00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:26.276
Mikey. Aye. Yeah, it's Mark Renton.

93
00:07:26.363 --> 00:07:28.775
Look, I wondered, could you help me out?

94
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.482
<i>This was typical of Mikey Forrester.</i>

95
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.076
What the fuck are these?

96
00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.573
<i>Under the normal run of things</i>

97
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:39.282
<i>I'd have nothing to do with the cunt,
but this wasn't the normal run of things.</i>

98
00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:41.117
Opium suppositories.

99
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.082
Ideal for your purposes.

100
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:47.248
Slow release, bring you down gradually.

101
00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:51.131
Custom fucking designed for your needs.

102
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.837
I want a fucking hit.

103
00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.639
That's all I've got, man. Take it or leave it.

104
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.061
Are you feeling better now, then, eh?

105
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:13.115
Oh, aye. For all the good they've done me,
I might as well have stuck them up my arse.

106
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.536
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

107
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:22.037
<i>The heroin from my last hit is fading away,
and the suppositories have yet to melt.</i>

108
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:26.582
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

109
00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:38.432
<i>I fantasise about a massive,
pristine convenience,</i>

110
00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:43.433
<i>brilliant gold taps, virginal white marble,
a seat carved from ebony,</i>

111
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:45.514
<i>a cistern full of Chanel No. 5</i>

112
00:08:45.609 --> 00:08:49.398
<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

113
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:53.439
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

114
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:14.964
Fuck.

115
00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.055
Yes, you fucking dancer!

116
00:11:28.897 --> 00:11:29.978
<i>And now,</i>

117
00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.604
<i>now I'm ready.</i>

118
00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:36.026
<i>The downside of coming off junk
was I knew I'd need</i>

119
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.025
<i>to mix with my friends again
in a state of full consciousness.</i>

120
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.196
<i>It was awful.</i>

121
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:43.776
<i>They reminded me so much of myself,
I could hardly bear to look at them.</i>

122
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:47.371
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.
He came off junk at the same time as me</i>

123
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.540
<i>not because he wanted to, you understand,
but just to annoy me.</i>

124
00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:54.962
<i>Just to show me how easily he could do it,
thereby downgrading my own struggle.</i>

125
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:57.130
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

126
00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.546
<i>And when all I wanted to do was lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>

127
00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:04.301
<i>he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life.</i>

128
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.720
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

129
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:09.472
What do you mean?

130
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:14.975
Well, at one point you've got it,
then you lose it, and it's gone forever,

131
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:16.817
all walks of life.

132
00:12:17.654 --> 00:12:20.646
Georgie Best, for example, had it, lost it.

133
00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.489
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

134
00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.567
Lou Reed, some of his solo stuff
is not bad.

135
00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:28.404
No, it's not bad,
but it's not great either, is it?

136
00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.411
And in your heart, you kind of know
that although it sounds all right,

137
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.742
it's actually just shite.

138
00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:37.996
So, who else?

139
00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:43.256
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

140
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:46.634
Okay, so what's the point
you're trying to make?

141
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:52.846
All I am trying to do, Mark, is to help you
understand that <i>The Name of the Rose</i>

142
00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:57.354
is merely a blip on an otherwise
uninterrupted downward trajectory.

143
00:12:57.527 --> 00:12:59.859
And what about <i>The Untouchables?</i>

144
00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.525
I don't rate that at all.

145
00:13:02.699 --> 00:13:04.815
Despite the Academy award?

146
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.531
That means fuck-all. It's a sympathy vote.

147
00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:15.041
So, we all get old,
we can't hack it any more and that's it?

148
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.618
Yeah.

149
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.499
That's your theory?

150
00:13:19.883 --> 00:13:21.044
Yeah.

151
00:13:22.343 --> 00:13:24.505
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

152
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.678
Give me the gun.

153
00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:30.174
Give me the gun.

154
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.648
Do you see the beast?

155
00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:41.193
Have you got it in your sights?

156
00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.900
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

157
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:47.900
This should present no significant problems.

158
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.504
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

159
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:08.841
<i>Without heroin, I attempted to lead
a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen.</i>

160
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.849
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, cowboy.

161
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.021
- Now remember.
- What?

162
00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:19.973
If they think you're not trying,
you're in trouble, right?

163
00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.602
First hint of that and they'll be on to
the DHSS, "This cunt is not trying."

164
00:14:23.738 --> 00:14:26.105
- And your Giro's fucking finished, right?
- Right.

165
00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:29.404
- But then again, try too hard...
- You might get the fucking job.

166
00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.155
- Exactly.
- Nightmare.

167
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.949
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

168
00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.494
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

169
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:39.584
I get all nervous
and I can't answer any of their questions

170
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.789
like I'm a footballer
and I get nerves on the big occasion.

171
00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:44.085
Try some of this, Spud.

172
00:14:44.175 --> 00:14:46.837
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

173
00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.557
No, I went to Craigie, Craignewton.

174
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.678
I just put down Royal Edinburgh College
to help get the job.

175
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:55.801
There's too much discrimination
in this town, man.

176
00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.101
'Cause they're both schools, right?

177
00:14:57.188 --> 00:14:59.680
We're all in this together,
and I wanted to put across

178
00:14:59.816 --> 00:15:03.354
the general idea rather than the details.
People get all hung up on details.

179
00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:06.148
Like, which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

180
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:08.818
Could be six, could be none.
It's not important.

181
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.658
What is important is that I am, yes?

182
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.912
Mr Murphy, do you mean
that you lied on your application?

183
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:19.833
No! Well, yes.
Only to get my foot in the door.

184
00:15:20.295 --> 00:15:21.911
Showing initiative and that, like.

185
00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.463
But you were referred here
by the Department of Employment.

186
00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:28.008
There was no need for you
to get your "foot in the door" as you put it.

187
00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.961
Yeah, cool. Whatever you say.

188
00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:33.433
Sorry, you're the man, the dude in the chair.

189
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:36.804
I am merely here. Obviously, I'm here.

190
00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:40.808
Mr Murphy, what exactly attracts you
to the leisure industry?

191
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.516
In a word, pleasure.

192
00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:47.520
Like, my pleasure in other people's leisure.

193
00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.987
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

194
00:15:53.036 --> 00:15:56.779
Oh, yes! 'Cause I'm a bit of
a perfectionist, actually. Yes, I am.

195
00:15:56.873 --> 00:15:59.956
See, for me it's got to be the best
or it's nothing at all.

196
00:16:00.043 --> 00:16:03.035
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I just cannot be bothered.

197
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.380
But, hey, I'm getting good vibes about
this interview thing today, though, man.

198
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:09.545
Seems to me like it's going pretty well, eh?

199
00:16:10.678 --> 00:16:12.055
Thank you, Mr Murphy.

200
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.922
We'll let you know.

201
00:16:15.558 --> 00:16:16.798
The pleasure was mine, man.

202
00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:18.884
<i>Spud had done well,
I was proud of him.</i>

203
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.684
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

204
00:16:25.276 --> 00:16:28.143
Picture the scene.
The other fucking week there

205
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:30.695
down the fucking Volley.
Me and Tommy playing pool.

206
00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.114
I'm playing like Paul fucking Newman
by the way.

207
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:35.574
Giving the boy here the tanning of a lifetime.

208
00:16:37.038 --> 00:16:40.656
So it comes to the last shot,
the deciding ball of the whole tournament.

209
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.664
I'm on the black and he's sat in the corner
looking all fucking biscuit-arsed

210
00:16:44.754 --> 00:16:48.918
when this hard cunt comes in,
obviously fucking fancied himself.

211
00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:51.458
Starts staring at me,

212
00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:55.383
looking at me, right fucking at me,
as if to say, "Come ahead, square go."

213
00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.932
You know me. I'm not the type of cunt
that goes looking for fucking bother

214
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.098
but at the end of the day
I'm the cunt with the pool cue

215
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.564
and he can get the fat end in his puss
any time he fucking wanted, like.

216
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.141
So I squares up, casual like.

217
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:10.268
What does the hard cunt do?

218
00:17:10.405 --> 00:17:14.114
Or the so-called hard cunt. Shites it,

219
00:17:14.242 --> 00:17:18.907
puts down his drink, turns and gets
the fuck out of there, and after that,

220
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:22.447
well, the game was mine.

221
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:27.873
<i>And that was it.</i>

222
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:32.003
<i>That was Begbie's story. Or at least
that was Begbie's version of the story.</i>

223
00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:35.343
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

224
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:39.055
<i>You always got the truth from Tommy.
It was one of his major weaknesses.</i>

225
00:17:39.142 --> 00:17:42.851
<i>He never told lies, he never took drugs,
and he never cheated on anyone.</i>

226
00:17:44.272 --> 00:17:48.857
It was Wednesday morning. We were in
the Volley playing pool, that much is true.

227
00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:52.478
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

228
00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:56.155
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the fucking cue,

229
00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:57.653
never mind pot a ball.

230
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.868
I'm doing my best to lose, you know,
trying to humour him, like.

231
00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:02.533
<i>But it's not doing any good.</i>

232
00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:05.282
<i>Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.</i>

233
00:18:05.376 --> 00:18:08.334
<i>Every time Begbie goes near the table,
he fucks it up.</i>

234
00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:09.911
Oh, fuck's sake.

235
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.253
So, he's got the hump, right?

236
00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:19.137
But, finally, I managed to set it up
so all he has to do is to pot the black

237
00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:21.965
to win one game,
to salvage a little bit of pride

238
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.847
and maybe not kick my head in, right?

239
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:28.104
So, he's on the black, pressure shot.

240
00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.860
<i>Then it all goes wrong, big time.</i>

241
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:37.109
Fuck!

242
00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:41.402
<i>He picks on this specky wee gadge
at the bar</i>

243
00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.245
<i>and accuses him of putting him off
by looking at him.</i>

244
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.329
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

245
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.077
<i>The poor wee cunt hasn't even glanced
in our direction.</i>

246
00:18:47.168 --> 00:18:48.124
Fuck off!

247
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:49.872
<i>He was going to chib him, I tell you.</i>

248
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.588
Then I thought he was going to do me.

249
00:18:56.052 --> 00:18:58.714
The beggar is fucking psycho, man.

250
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.764
But he's a mate, you know.
So what can you do?

251
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.762
Can I borrow this?

252
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:07.143
<i>RENTON". What indeed could one do?</i>

253
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.643
<i>Just stand back and watch,
and try not to get involved?</i>

254
00:19:11.943 --> 00:19:13.559
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs either.</i>

255
00:19:13.653 --> 00:19:16.566
<i>He just did people, that's what he got off on.</i>

256
00:19:16.656 --> 00:19:18.146
<i>His own sensory addiction.</i>

257
00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:29.123
That lassie got glassed and no cunt leaves
here till we find out what cunt did it.

258
00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:30.788
Who the fuck are you?

259
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.764
Oh, Tom.

260
00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.944
<i>- Oh, Lizzy, it's so good.
- Oh, Tom, I'm coming.</i>

261
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:06.828
<i>As I sat watching the intimate
and highly personal video</i>

262
00:20:06.956 --> 00:20:10.290
<i>stolen only hours earlier
from one of my best friends,</i>

263
00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:14.290
<i>I realised that something important
was missing from my life.</i>

264
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:03.759
- I read it in <i>Cosmopolitan.</i>
- It's an interesting theory.

265
00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:05.348
Actually, it's a nightmare.

266
00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:07.217
I've been desperate for a shag

267
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.842
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

268
00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:11.771
You should try it with Tommy.

269
00:21:11.854 --> 00:21:15.267
What, and deny myself the only pleasure
I get from him?

270
00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:16.598
Did I tell you about my birthday?

271
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:20.230
- No, what happened?
- He forgot. Useless motherfucker.

272
00:21:37.254 --> 00:21:38.244
Did she go ballistic?

273
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:43.592
Big-time. Absolutely fucking right.
"It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide."

274
00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:49.259
What are you two talking about?

275
00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:51.716
Football.

276
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:53.551
What are you talking about?

277
00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:54.807
Shopping.

278
00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:58.519
<i>The situation
was becoming serious.</i>

279
00:21:58.609 --> 00:22:01.818
<i>Young Renton noticed the haste
with which the successful</i>

280
00:22:01.904 --> 00:22:06.899
<i>in the sexual sphere, as in all others,
segregated themselves from the failures.</i>

281
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:21.417
<i>Heroin had robbed Renton of his sex drive,
but now it returned with a vengeance.</i>

282
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:24.632
<i>And as the impotence of those days
faded into memory,</i>

283
00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:28.178
<i>grim desperation
took a hold in his sex-crazed mind.</i>

284
00:22:28.723 --> 00:22:32.387
<i>His post-junk libido,
fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine</i>

285
00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:36.185
<i>taunted him remorselessly
with his own unsatisfied desire.</i>

286
00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:38.388
<i>Dot, dot, dot.</i>

287
00:23:35.873 --> 00:23:39.491
<i>And with that,
Mark Renton had fallen in love.</i>

288
00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:52.299
Excuse me, excuse me. I don't mean
to harass you, but I was very impressed

289
00:23:52.389 --> 00:23:55.552
with your capable and stylish manner
of dealing with that situation.

290
00:23:55.643 --> 00:23:58.010
I was thinking to myself,
"Now, this girl's special."

291
00:23:58.104 --> 00:23:59.185
Thanks.

292
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.887
- What's your name?
- Diane.

293
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.143
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

294
00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:05.271
- Where's that?
- It's where I live.

295
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:06.442
Great.

296
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:07.610
What?

297
00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:11.109
I'll come back with you if you like,
but I'm not promising anything.

298
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.487
Do you find
that this approach usually works?

299
00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:16.035
Or let me guess, you've never tried it before.

300
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:19.285
In fact, you don't normally approach girls,
am I right?

301
00:24:19.375 --> 00:24:22.163
The truth is that you're a quiet,
sensitive type

302
00:24:22.253 --> 00:24:26.463
but if I'm prepared to take a chance,
I might just get to know the inner you.

303
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:30.918
Witty, adventurous,
passionate, loving, loyal.

304
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.217
Taxi!

305
00:24:32.888 --> 00:24:36.176
A little bit crazy, a little bit bad. But, hey,

306
00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:39.103
don't us girls just love that?

307
00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:41.018
Eh?

308
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:44.890
Well, what's wrong, boy?
Cat got your tongue?

309
00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:46.690
I left something...

310
00:24:48.696 --> 00:24:50.687
Are you getting in or not, pal?

311
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:16.760
Do you understand? I expect you
to be a considerate and thoughtful lover.

312
00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:19.924
- Generous but firm.
- What?

313
00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:23.557
Failure on your part to live up
to these very reasonable expectations

314
00:25:23.647 --> 00:25:27.481
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

315
00:25:28.194 --> 00:25:29.400
Right?

316
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.452
Diane?

317
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:47.118
- What?
- Shut up!

318
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.331
Wake up, Spud.

319
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:31.704
Wake up.

320
00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:33.456
Sex.

321
00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:36.717
Casual sex.

322
00:26:44.353 --> 00:26:46.594
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

323
00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:47.936
Now?

324
00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.526
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

325
00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:53.769
So, let's see what I'm missing.

326
00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.123
Not much.

327
00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:15.249
<i>There's the captain, Archie Gemmill,</i>

328
00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:17.003
<i>picking it up from the outside.</i>

329
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:20.757
<i>I think he wants to go himself.
Is he gonna go?</i>

330
00:27:20.848 --> 00:27:22.759
<i>He's going all the way. And he scores!</i>

331
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.345
<i>What a magnificent goal!</i>

332
00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.935
<i>Gemmill at his very best.</i>

333
00:27:28.022 --> 00:27:30.764
<i>What a penetrating goal that was!</i>

334
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:35.981
I haven't felt that good since Archie
Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.

335
00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:39.863
Right.

336
00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:41.657
You can't sleep here.

337
00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:43.109
- What?
- Out.

338
00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:45.240
Come on.

339
00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:49.624
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa
in the hall or go home, it's up to you.

340
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:53.339
And don't make any noise.

341
00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:55.621
Jesus.

342
00:28:02.473 --> 00:28:05.841
What do you mean, "It's gone"?
Where has it gone, Tommy?

343
00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:07.516
It'll be here somewhere.

344
00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:12.980
- I might have returned it by mistake.
- Returned it?

345
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:16.309
Where? The video shop, Tommy?

346
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:19.062
The fucking video shop?

347
00:28:20.032 --> 00:28:23.741
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

348
00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:27.533
God, Tommy, I feel sick.

349
00:29:01.949 --> 00:29:03.656
- Hi.
- Hello.

350
00:29:11.708 --> 00:29:12.834
Fuck.

351
00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:50.695
Come in and sit down.

352
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.705
Like some coffee?

353
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.031
Aye.

354
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:58.206
- You must be Mark.
- Aye, that's me.

355
00:30:04.178 --> 00:30:07.466
- Are you a friend of Diane's?
- More a friend of a friend, no?

356
00:30:07.556 --> 00:30:08.637
Right.

357
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:13.137
Are you her flatmates, like?

358
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.391
Flatmates?

359
00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:18.981
I must remember that one.

360
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:21.521
Morning.

361
00:30:36.376 --> 00:30:39.038
- Good morning, Spud.
- Morning, Gail.

362
00:30:39.129 --> 00:30:41.336
Mr Houston. Mrs Houston.

363
00:30:41.423 --> 00:30:44.461
Morning, Spud.
Sit down and have some breakfast.

364
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:49.048
Sorry about last night, by the way.

365
00:30:49.139 --> 00:30:51.756
That's all right. I slept fine on the sofa.

366
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:56.973
I had a bit much to drink,
had a bit of an accident.

367
00:30:57.648 --> 00:30:59.855
Don't worry, son. These things happen.

368
00:30:59.942 --> 00:31:02.775
Does a man good
to cut loose once in a while.

369
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:05.649
This one could do with being tied up
once in a while.

370
00:31:05.739 --> 00:31:09.698
- I'll put the sheets in the machine now.
- No, I'll wash them.

371
00:31:09.785 --> 00:31:11.526
- There's no need.
- No, it's no problem.

372
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.031
It's no problem for me, either.

373
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.034
- I'd rather take care of it myself, actually.
- Honestly, it's no problem.

374
00:31:16.124 --> 00:31:18.536
- Really, no!
- Spud, they're my sheets.

375
00:31:31.807 --> 00:31:34.390
- I don't see why not.
- Because it's illegal, that's why not.

376
00:31:34.476 --> 00:31:36.808
- What, holding hands?
- No, not holding hands.

377
00:31:36.937 --> 00:31:38.644
In that case you can do it.

378
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.983
You were quite happy
to do a lot more last night.

379
00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:42.522
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

380
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:44.316
Do you know what they do
to people like me inside?

381
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.861
They cut your balls off
and flush them down the fucking toilet.

382
00:31:46.947 --> 00:31:51.407
- Calm down. You're not going to jail.
- That's very easy for you to say, Diane.

383
00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:54.281
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not.

384
00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:57.742
If you don't see me again, I'll tell the police.

385
00:32:00.294 --> 00:32:02.126
I'll see you around then.

386
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:16.932
Now what?

387
00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:18.926
We go for a walk.

388
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:20.978
- What?
- A walk.

389
00:32:22.816 --> 00:32:24.477
- Where?
- There.

390
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:28.106
Are you serious?

391
00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:04.388
What are you waiting for?

392
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.515
Hey, Tommy.

393
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:10.061
This is not natural, man.

394
00:33:10.864 --> 00:33:12.901
It's the great outdoors.

395
00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:15.073
It's fresh air.

396
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:18.243
Look, Tommy, we know
you're getting a hard time off Lizzy

397
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:21.072
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.

398
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:25.751
- Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
- It's shite being Scottish.

399
00:33:26.588 --> 00:33:30.422
We're the lowest of the low.
The scum of the fucking earth.

400
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:34.669
The most wretched,
miserable, servile, pathetic trash

401
00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:37.346
that was ever shat into civilisation.

402
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:41.096
Some people hate the English, I don't.
They're just wankers.

403
00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:44.437
We, on the other hand,
are colonised by wankers.

404
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.103
Can't even find a decent culture
to be colonised by.

405
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.238
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

406
00:33:51.613 --> 00:33:53.945
It's a shite state of affairs to be in, Tommy.

407
00:33:54.032 --> 00:33:58.447
And all the fresh air in the world
won't make any fucking difference.

408
00:34:07.462 --> 00:34:09.920
Sorry, man. Sorry. No, I'm sorry.

409
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:11.880
I appreciate it, Tommy.

410
00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:13.457
<i>At or around this time,</i>

411
00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:17.131
<i>Spud, Sick Boy and I made a healthy,
informed, democratic decision</i>

412
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.596
<i>to get back on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

413
00:34:19.683 --> 00:34:21.640
<i>Took about 12 hours.</i>

414
00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:28.984
<i>It looks easy this, but it's not.</i>

415
00:34:29.526 --> 00:34:32.359
<i>It looks like a doss, like a soft option</i>

416
00:34:32.654 --> 00:34:36.488
<i>but living like this, it's a full-time business.</i>

417
00:34:55.844 --> 00:35:00.589
Ursula Andress,
the quintessential Bond girl.

418
00:35:01.183 --> 00:35:03.015
That's what everyone says.

419
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:06.435
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

420
00:35:07.355 --> 00:35:10.768
Beautiful, exotic, highly sexual,

421
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:14.944
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

422
00:35:16.198 --> 00:35:19.281
Shite. I mean, let's face it, mate.

423
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.905
She'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,
she'd shag the whole fucking lot of us.

424
00:35:34.883 --> 00:35:37.545
Yep, I knew he was going to do that.

425
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.144
Lizzy's gone, Mark.
She's gone and fucking dumped me.

426
00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.601
It was that videotape.

427
00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:59.731
And that Iggy Pop business
and all other sorts of shit.

428
00:36:00.492 --> 00:36:03.655
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

429
00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:05.994
I said to her, I said,

430
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:08.664
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

431
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.252
But no fucking way.

432
00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:16.164
Honor Blackman, a.k.a. Pussy Galore, right?

433
00:36:16.758 --> 00:36:19.500
What a total fucking misnomer.

434
00:36:21.096 --> 00:36:23.588
I mean, I wouldn't touch her with yours.

435
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.674
I want to try it, Mark.

436
00:36:26.977 --> 00:36:30.390
You're always going on about
how it's like the ultimate hit and that.

437
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.016
Better than sex.

438
00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:40.358
Come on, man, I'm a fucking adult,
I can find out for myself.

439
00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:46.618
I've got the money.

440
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:53.288
Personality, I mean, that's what counts,
right?

441
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:58.543
Personality, I mean, that's what keeps
a relationship going through the years.

442
00:36:59.718 --> 00:37:01.174
Like heroin.

443
00:37:02.137 --> 00:37:03.218
I mean,

444
00:37:04.139 --> 00:37:06.801
heroin's got great fucking personality.

445
00:37:21.364 --> 00:37:24.732
<i>Swanney taught us to adore
and respect the National Health Service,</i>

446
00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:26.942
<i>for it was the source of much of our gear.</i>

447
00:37:27.037 --> 00:37:29.995
<i>We stole drugs,
we stole prescriptions or bought them,</i>

448
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:32.994
<i>sold them, swapped them,
forged them, photocopied them.</i>

449
00:37:33.335 --> 00:37:37.829
<i>Or traded drugs with cancer victims,
alcoholics, old-age pensioners,</i>

450
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:40.839
<i>AIDS patients,
epileptics and bored housewives.</i>

451
00:37:41.176 --> 00:37:45.261
<i>We took morphine, diamorphine,
cyclizine, codeine, temazepam,</i>

452
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.301
<i>nitrezepam, phenobarbitone
and sodium amytal,</i>

453
00:37:48.391 --> 00:37:52.555
<i>dextropropoxyphene, methadone,
nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine,</i>

454
00:37:52.687 --> 00:37:55.770
<i>buprenorphine,
dextromoramide, chlormethiazole.</i>

455
00:37:56.024 --> 00:37:59.642
<i>The streets are awash with drugs
you can have for unhappiness and pain</i>

456
00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.397
<i>and we took them all.</i>

457
00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:06.198
<i>Fuck it, we would have injected vitamin C
if only they'd made it illegal.</i>

458
00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.544
Pardon me,
may I use your bathroom? Thank you.

459
00:38:30.392 --> 00:38:31.553
Stop, psycho.

460
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.607
Rent-boy. No fucking smack.

461
00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:53.491
<i>But the good times
couldn't last forever.</i>

462
00:39:00.672 --> 00:39:05.758
<i>I think Allison had been screaming all day,
but it hadn't really registered before.</i>

463
00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:09.136
<i>She might have been screaming
for a week for all I knew.</i>

464
00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:11.338
<i>It'd been days since I heard anyone speak.</i>

465
00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:14.516
<i>Surely someone must've said something
in all that time.</i>

466
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.060
<i>Surely to fuck someone must have.</i>

467
00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:19.020
- Allison!
- Help me, please!

468
00:39:19.107 --> 00:39:20.222
Calm down.

469
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:23.350
Everyone's going to be just fine.

470
00:39:23.486 --> 00:39:25.818
<i>Nothing could have been further
from the truth.</i>

471
00:39:26.573 --> 00:39:29.315
<i>In point of fact,
nothing was going to be just fine.</i>

472
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:32.151
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

473
00:39:32.245 --> 00:39:37.081
<i>Bad, I mean, everything was going to be
even worse than it already was.</i>

474
00:39:37.375 --> 00:39:40.242
My God! No, my God!

475
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:55.887
Fuck!

476
00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:58.093
Please, please!

477
00:40:04.611 --> 00:40:09.321
<i>It wasn't my baby. She wasn't
my baby. Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.</i>

478
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.693
<i>Spud's, Swanney's, Sick Boy's, I don't know.</i>

479
00:40:14.829 --> 00:40:17.161
<i>Maybe Allison knew, maybe not.</i>

480
00:40:18.124 --> 00:40:22.368
<i>I wished I could think of something to say.
Something sympathetic.</i>

481
00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:23.577
<i>Something human.</i>

482
00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:25.287
Say something, Mark.

483
00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:32.044
Fucking say something, huh?

484
00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:38.474
I'm cooking up.

485
00:40:56.454 --> 00:41:00.322
Cook us up a shot, Rents.
I really need a hit.

486
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:05.290
<i>So she did, I could understand that,</i>

487
00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:07.003
<i>to take the pain away.</i>

488
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:11.003
<i>So I cooked up and she got a hit.</i>

489
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:15.049
<i>But only after me, that went without saying.</i>

490
00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:20.551
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

491
00:41:20.812 --> 00:41:23.349
<i>It wasn't just the baby that died that day.</i>

492
00:41:23.439 --> 00:41:26.773
<i>Something inside Sick Boy was lost
and never returned.</i>

493
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.773
<i>It seemed he had no theory
with which to explain a moment like this.</i>

494
00:41:30.864 --> 00:41:32.070
<i>Nor did I.</i>

495
00:41:33.032 --> 00:41:35.990
<i>Our only response was to keep on going
and fuck everything.</i>

496
00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:40.738
<i>Pile misery upon misery, heap it up on
a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile.</i>

497
00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:44.791
<i>Then squirt it into a stinking, purulent vein
and do it all over again.</i>

498
00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:48.917
<i>Keep on going, getting up, going out,
robbing, stealing, fucking people over.</i>

499
00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:53.046
<i>Propelling ourselves with longing towards
the day that it would all go wrong.</i>

500
00:41:53.136 --> 00:41:55.173
<i>Because no matter how much you stash</i>

501
00:41:55.263 --> 00:41:57.675
<i>or how much you steal,
you never have enough.</i>

502
00:41:57.765 --> 00:42:00.928
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>

503
00:42:01.019 --> 00:42:03.351
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

504
00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:10.942
<i>Sooner or later this kind of thing
was bound to happen.</i>

505
00:42:17.243 --> 00:42:19.860
Because shoplifting is theft,
which is a crime,

506
00:42:19.954 --> 00:42:24.369
and despite what you may believe,
there is no such entity as victimless crime.

507
00:42:24.459 --> 00:42:27.997
Heroin addiction may explain your actions,
but it does not excuse them.

508
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:32.043
Mr Murphy, you are a habitual thief,
devoid of regret and remorse.

509
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:34.500
I'm sentencing you
to six months' imprisonment.

510
00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:38.303
My only worry is that it will not be long
before we meet again.

511
00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:42.724
Mr Renton, I understand that you have
entered into a programme of rehabilitation

512
00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.098
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

513
00:42:46.356 --> 00:42:48.393
The suspension of your sentence

514
00:42:48.483 --> 00:42:51.851
is conditional on your continued
co-operation with this programme.

515
00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:54.107
Should you stand guilty before me again,

516
00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:57.189
I shall not hesitate
to impose a custodial sentence.

517
00:42:57.867 --> 00:42:59.824
Thank you, Your Honour.

518
00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:02.824
With God's help,
I'll conquer this terrible affliction.

519
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:19.836
<i>What can you say?</i>

520
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:22.214
<i>Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

521
00:43:22.392 --> 00:43:26.101
It was fucking obvious
that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.

522
00:43:26.187 --> 00:43:27.928
Hope you've learned your lesson, Son.

523
00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:31.936
My son, I thought
I was going to lose you there.

524
00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:35.360
You're nothing but trouble to me,
but I still love you.

525
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.819
You'd better clean up your fucking act,
sunshine. Cut that shite out forever.

526
00:43:39.909 --> 00:43:42.822
Listen to Francis, Mark.
He's talking sense, kid.

527
00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:46.576
Fucking right I am. See, inside,
you wouldn't last two fucking days.

528
00:43:46.666 --> 00:43:49.784
There are better things than the needle,
Rents. Choose life.

529
00:43:50.044 --> 00:43:52.126
I remember
when you were a wee baby.

530
00:43:52.213 --> 00:43:53.795
<i>Mama's little baby</i>

531
00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:55.747
<i>loves shortening, shortening</i>

532
00:43:55.842 --> 00:43:58.630
<i>Mama's little baby
loves shortening bread</i>

533
00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:13.473
I'm sorry, Mrs Murphy.

534
00:44:14.527 --> 00:44:17.394
It was not fair,
Spud going down and not me.

535
00:44:19.615 --> 00:44:21.481
Well, it's not our fault.

536
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:25.527
Your boy went down
because he was a fucking smack-head.

537
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.238
If that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

538
00:44:30.877 --> 00:44:33.619
I was the fucking cunt
that tried to get him off it.

539
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.790
- I'll get the fucking drinks then, eh?
- Aye.

540
00:44:42.138 --> 00:44:44.880
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.</i>

541
00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:48.509
<i>Here I was, surrounded by my family
and my so-called mates</i>

542
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:51.971
<i>and I've never felt so alone.
Never in all my puff.</i>

543
00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.102
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this programme,</i>

544
00:44:58.196 --> 00:45:00.437
<i>the state-sponsored addiction,</i>

545
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:04.616
<i>three sickly sweet doses
of methadone a day instead of smack.</i>

546
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:06.613
<i>But it's never enough.</i>

547
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:09.533
<i>And at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.</i>

548
00:45:10.833 --> 00:45:14.622
<i>I took all three this morning and now
I've got 18 hours to go till my next shot</i>

549
00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:17.750
<i>and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost.</i>

550
00:45:18.674 --> 00:45:21.757
<i>I need to visit the Mother Superior
for one hit.</i>

551
00:45:22.845 --> 00:45:24.631
<i>One fucking hit</i>

552
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:27.714
<i>to get us over this long, hard day.</i>

553
00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:34.889
- What's on the menu this evening, sir?
- Your favourite dish.

554
00:45:34.982 --> 00:45:36.063
Excellent.

555
00:45:36.609 --> 00:45:38.816
- Usual table, sir?
- Why, thank you.

556
00:45:38.903 --> 00:45:42.066
Would sir care to pay for his bill
in advance?

557
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.822
No, stick it on my tab.

558
00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:45.239
I regret to inform, sir,

559
00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:48.535
credit limit was reached
and breached quite some time ago.

560
00:45:48.621 --> 00:45:50.362
Well, in that case...

561
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.577
Hard currency, that'll do nicely.

562
00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:57.457
Can't be too careful when we're dealing
with your type, can we, sir?

563
00:45:58.506 --> 00:46:01.498
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread, perhaps?

564
00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:06.337
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the
intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.

565
00:46:06.431 --> 00:46:10.015
As you wish, sir. As you wish.

566
00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:11.204
Perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi?

567
00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:21.948
Open your eyes.

568
00:49:22.293 --> 00:49:24.785
Wake up. Come on. Wake up.

569
00:50:56.137 --> 00:51:00.597
<i>I don't feel the sickness yet,
but it's in the mail, that's for sure.</i>

570
00:51:00.808 --> 00:51:03.140
<i>I'm in the junkie limbo at the moment.</i>

571
00:51:03.436 --> 00:51:04.801
<i>Too ill to sleep.</i>

572
00:51:05.146 --> 00:51:07.057
<i>Too tired to stay awake.</i>

573
00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:09.984
<i>But the sickness is on its way.</i>

574
00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:14.820
<i>Sweat, chills, nausea, pain and craving.</i>

575
00:51:15.114 --> 00:51:19.073
<i>A need like nothing else I've ever known
will soon take hold of me.</i>

576
00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.946
<i>It's on its way.</i>

577
00:51:26.792 --> 00:51:30.660
<i>Oh, you've got green eyes
Oh, you've got blue eyes</i>

578
00:51:30.838 --> 00:51:32.670
<i>Oh, you've got gray eyes</i>

579
00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:38.672
<i>And I've never seen anyone
quite like you before</i>

580
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:44.758
<i>No, I've never met anyone
quite like you before</i>

581
00:52:01.702 --> 00:52:03.534
We'll help you, Son.

582
00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:08.122
You'll stay here with us until you get better.

583
00:52:08.209 --> 00:52:09.870
We're going to beat this together.

584
00:52:10.002 --> 00:52:12.619
Maybe I should go back to the clinic.

585
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.544
No! No clinics. No methadone.

586
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.502
That only made you worse,
you said so yourself.

587
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:26.383
You lied to us, Son,
your own mother and father.

588
00:52:26.519 --> 00:52:28.556
- You could bring us some jellies.
- No!

589
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:31.312
You're worse coming off that
than you are with the heroin.

590
00:52:31.398 --> 00:52:34.140
- Nothing at all!
- It's a clean break this time.

591
00:52:34.235 --> 00:52:36.818
You're staying here
where we can keep an eye on you.

592
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:39.066
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
I really do,

593
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:43.400
but I just need one more score.
Just bring me one more hit, please.

594
00:52:44.537 --> 00:52:46.744
I need one more fucking hit!

595
00:52:48.249 --> 00:52:49.580
You fuck!

596
00:52:53.379 --> 00:52:55.370
Hit. Hit.

597
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:12.557
Well, this is a good fucking laugh, ain't it?

598
00:53:14.275 --> 00:53:18.769
You sweat that shite out of your system
because if I come back and it's still here,

599
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.612
I'll fucking kick it out.

600
00:53:22.867 --> 00:53:24.073
Okay.

601
00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:34.455
God!

602
00:53:50.769 --> 00:53:55.309
<i>Question number one.
The human immunodeficiency virus is a...</i>

603
00:53:56.317 --> 00:53:59.480
<i>- Retrovirus?
- Retrovirus is the right answer.</i>

604
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:11.658
<i>It's a mug's game, Mrs Renton.</i>

605
00:54:12.625 --> 00:54:15.959
<i>I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself, far from it, but</i>

606
00:54:17.129 --> 00:54:20.497
<i>there comes a time when you have
to turn your back on that nonsense</i>

607
00:54:20.633 --> 00:54:22.465
<i>and just say no.</i>

608
00:54:26.847 --> 00:54:28.929
<i>Just say no.</i>

609
00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:31.678
<i>Oh, my God, she's dead.</i>

610
00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:01.454
<i>Question number two.</i>

611
00:55:01.548 --> 00:55:06.463
<i>HIV binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?</i>

612
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:08.544
<i>Which receptor is that?</i>

613
00:55:15.396 --> 00:55:16.557
<i>CD4.</i>

614
00:55:16.814 --> 00:55:19.522
<i>CD4 is the right answer.</i>

615
00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:27.150
Better than sex, Rents. Better than sex.

616
00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:30.074
The ultimate hit.

617
00:55:31.495 --> 00:55:34.829
I'm a fucking adult, I can find out for myself.

618
00:55:35.916 --> 00:55:38.408
Well, I'm finding out, all right.

619
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:45.498
Tommy.

620
00:55:47.428 --> 00:55:48.543
No!

621
00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:56.267
<i>Is he guilty? Or not guilty?</i>

622
00:55:59.565 --> 00:56:00.771
<i>He's our son.</i>

623
00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:10.364
Don't! Dawn!

624
00:56:10.451 --> 00:56:14.115
Dawn! Stop!

625
00:56:15.956 --> 00:56:17.071
No!

626
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:19.453
No! Don't do this to me!

627
00:56:19.752 --> 00:56:21.038
Stop!

628
00:56:27.426 --> 00:56:28.587
Mark.

629
00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:31.586
Mark.

630
00:56:32.681 --> 00:56:33.796
Mark.

631
00:56:37.436 --> 00:56:39.598
There's something you need to do.

632
00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:10.925
Come alive, 35.

633
00:57:11.512 --> 00:57:13.423
Box of tricks, 66.

634
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:16.343
MOTHER; Mark!

635
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:17.935
Mark, you've got a house.

636
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:20.009
House, house!

637
00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:22.265
For goodness' sake, Mark.

638
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:26.352
<i>It seems, however, I really am
the luckiest guy in the world.</i>

639
00:57:26.485 --> 00:57:29.352
<i>Several years of addiction
right in the middle of an epidemic,</i>

640
00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:31.437
<i>surrounded by the living dead.</i>

641
00:57:31.824 --> 00:57:34.031
<i>But not me. I'm negative.</i>

642
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:36.158
<i>It's official.</i>

643
00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:39.953
<i>And once the pain goes away,
that's when the real battle starts.</i>

644
00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:41.781
<i>Depression, boredom.</i>

645
00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:45.535
<i>You feel so fucking low,
you want to fucking top yourself.</i>

646
00:57:48.757 --> 00:57:49.747
Tommy.

647
00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:52.208
Tommy!

648
00:57:56.348 --> 00:57:58.214
Tommy, it's Mark, man.

649
00:58:06.859 --> 00:58:08.566
You all right, mate?

650
00:58:31.175 --> 00:58:33.212
- Getting out much, Tommy?
- No.

651
00:58:38.098 --> 00:58:40.556
- Following the game at all?
- No.

652
00:58:43.228 --> 00:58:45.344
No, me neither, really.

653
00:58:56.116 --> 00:58:57.948
You take the test?

654
00:58:59.912 --> 00:59:01.073
Aye.

655
00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:04.955
Clear?

656
00:59:06.043 --> 00:59:07.249
Aye.

657
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.120
That's nice.

658
00:59:14.468 --> 00:59:15.629
I'm sorry, Tommy.

659
00:59:19.097 --> 00:59:20.838
Got any gear on you?

660
00:59:21.642 --> 00:59:23.258
No, I'm clean, man.

661
00:59:24.937 --> 00:59:27.679
Well, sub us then, mate.

662
00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.311
I'm expecting a rent cheque.

663
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.668
Thanks, Mark.

664
00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.825
No bother.

665
00:59:54.508 --> 00:59:58.126
<i>No bother. None at all.
Not for me, anyway.</i>

666
00:59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.795
<i>Still, it's easy to be philosophical</i>

667
01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.177
<i>when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.</i>

668
01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:13.440
What do you want?

669
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.484
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

670
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.699
- Is that a promise then?
- Yes, it is, as a matter of fact.

671
01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:21.027
Calm down, I'm only asking.

672
01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:27.989
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.

673
01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:31.041
- I wouldn't mind a bit if it is.
- Well, it isn't.

674
01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.540
- It smells like it.
- You're too young.

675
01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.663
I'm too young for what?

676
01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.553
You're not getting any younger, Mark.

677
01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:50.887
The world's changing, music's changing,
even drugs are changing.

678
01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:55.691
You can't stay in here all day
dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

679
01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:57.518
It's Iggy Pop.

680
01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:00.070
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

681
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:03.653
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year.
Tommy went to see him.

682
01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:06.611
The point is,
you've got to find something new.

683
01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:12.082
<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

684
01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.459
<i>There was only one thing for it.</i>

685
01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.751
Lifestyle Letting Agency.

686
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.674
Yes. It's a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.

687
01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:06.929
<i>Ideally located in a quiet road
near to the local shops and transport.</i>

688
01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:10.095
<i>This one's two bedrooms
and a kitchen/diner.</i>

689
01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.802
<i>Fully fitted, in excellent decorative order.</i>

690
01:02:12.938 --> 01:02:14.303
<i>Lots of storage space.</i>

691
01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:18.273
<i>All mod cons and it's going at £320 a week.</i>

692
01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:29.277
<i>I settled in not too badly
and kept myself to myself.</i>

693
01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:30.987
<i>Sometimes, of course,
I thought about the guys,</i>

694
01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.038
<i>but mainly I didn't miss them at all.</i>

695
01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:34.668
<i>After all, this was boomtown,</i>

696
01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.368
<i>where any fool could make cash
from chaos, and plenty did.</i>

697
01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.835
<i>Tell you what I've got.</i>

698
01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:42.502
I've got a beautifully converted
Victorian town house.

699
01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:44.629
<i>I quite enjoyed the sound of it all.</i>

700
01:02:44.719 --> 01:02:49.509
<i>Profit, loss, margins, takeovers, lending,
letting, sub-letting, sub-dividing,</i>

701
01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.141
<i>cheating, scamming,
fragmenting, breaking away.</i>

702
01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:54.138
Who's got the keys to Talgarth Road?

703
01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.061
<i>There was no such thing as society.</i>

704
01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:59.523
<i>And even if there was,
I most certainly had nothing to do with it.</i>

705
01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:03.527
<i>For the first time in my adult life
I was almost content.</i>

706
01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:08.532
<i>"Dear Mark, I'm glad you found a job
and somewhere to live.</i>

707
01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:13.529
<i>"School is fine at the moment.
I'm not pregnant, but thanks for asking.</i>

708
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:17.200
<i>"Your friend Sick Boy asked me
last week if I would like to work for him.</i>

709
01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:18.993
<i>"But I told him where to go.</i>

710
01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:23.832
<i>"I met Spud who sends his regards.
Or at least I think that's what he said.</i>

711
01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:28.631
<i>"No one has seen Tommy for ages.</i>

712
01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:32.761
<i>"And finally, Francis Begbie
has been on television a lot this week,</i>

713
01:03:33.018 --> 01:03:36.227
<i>"as he is wanted by the police
in connection with an armed robbery</i>

714
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.186
<i>"in a jeweller's in Corstorphine.</i>

715
01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.856
<i>"Take care. Yours, with love, Diane."</i>

716
01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.614
<i>Francis Begbie.</i>

717
01:03:55.207 --> 01:03:56.538
Oh, no.

718
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.536
Armed robbery?

719
01:03:58.627 --> 01:03:59.708
What, with a replica?

720
01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:03.003
How the fuck can it be armed robbery
with a fucking replica?

721
01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:06.753
Fucking scandal. And the gear... Look.

722
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:13.426
Supposed to be fucking solid silver,
it's fucking garbage.

723
01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:16.847
Those young couples investing
all their fucking hopes in that stuff and all.

724
01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:19.804
- It's a scandal, Franco.
- Too fucking right it is.

725
01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.684
How about one of these Pot Noodles
by the way?

726
01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.766
I'm fucking Lee Marvin.

727
01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.405
Hey, Rents.

728
01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:36.157
<i>Begbie settled in, in no time at all.</i>

729
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.122
I've got no fucking cigarettes.

730
01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.219
Aye, right.

731
01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:12.030
It's me.

732
01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.950
Rents.

733
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.080
<i>Yeah, the guy's a psycho.</i>

734
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.879
<i>But it's true, he's a mate and all,
so what can you do?</i>

735
01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.978
Hey. Pop down the bookies
and put a line on for us.

736
01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:53.238
Can you not go yourself?

737
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:55.198
Well, seeing as how
I'm a fugitive from the law

738
01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:58.198
and I can't even walk
the fucking streets, you go.

739
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:00.620
Here.

740
01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:06.536
Doncaster. 4:40. £5 to win. Bad Boy.

741
01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.847
Buy some fucking beer and all.

742
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.307
Come on, Bad Boy.
Come on, son. Come on, son.

743
01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.392
Come on. Come on. Yeah!

744
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.360
Yeah.

745
01:06:38.745 --> 01:06:41.077
Bad Boy.

746
01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.239
<i>Came in at 16-to-1.</i>

747
01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.413
<i>And with the winnings,
we went out to celebrate.</i>

748
01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.487
<i>Diane was right. The world is changing.</i>

749
01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:23.829
<i>Music is changing, drugs are changing,
even men and women are changing.</i>

750
01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:27.958
<i>1,000 years from now, there?! be no guys
and no girls, just wankers.</i>

751
01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:29.872
<i>Sounds great to me.</i>

752
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.299
<i>It's just a pity no one told Begbie.</i>

753
01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.981
Fuck! Fuck!

754
01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.731
<i>You see, if you ask me,
we're heterosexual by default,</i>

755
01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.236
<i>not by decision.</i>

756
01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:02.579
<i>It's just a question of who you fancy.</i>

757
01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:06.075
<i>It's all about aesthetics
and it's fuck-all to do with morality.</i>

758
01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:07.660
Fuck!

759
01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:11.998
<i>But you try telling Begbie that.</i>

760
01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:15.168
Look, I'm not a fucking buftie
and that's the end of it.

761
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:17.594
Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.

762
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:23.801
Fucking listen to me,
you piece of junkie shit.

763
01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:28.268
A joke's a fucking joke,
you mention that again and I'll cut you up.

764
01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.021
You understand?

765
01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.860
<i>Since I last saw him,</i>

766
01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.939
<i>Sick Boy had reinvented himself
as a pimp and a pusher</i>

767
01:08:41.034 --> 01:08:43.526
<i>and was here, he said,
to mix business and pleasure,</i>

768
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:46.870
<i>setting up contacts,
as he constantly informed me,</i>

769
01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:51.117
<i>for the great smack deal
that was one day going to make him rich.</i>

770
01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.343
Good chips.

771
01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:01.335
I can't believe you did that.

772
01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:06.386
I got a good price for it.

773
01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:08.220
Rents, I need the money.

774
01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:10.348
It was my fucking telly.

775
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:16.184
Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so
humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered.

776
01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.525
Fucking rented anyway.

777
01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.524
Are you going to eat that?

778
01:09:28.998 --> 01:09:32.036
- Have you got a passport?
- Why?

779
01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:36.541
I met this bloke who runs a hotel, brothel.

780
01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.417
Loads of contacts.

781
01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:42.672
He does a nice sideline
in punting British passports to foreigners.

782
01:09:42.762 --> 01:09:44.673
Get you a good price.

783
01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.256
And why would I want to sell my passport?

784
01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.429
It was just an idea.

785
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.932
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>

786
01:09:57.068 --> 01:10:00.186
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal
and he didn't get rich.</i>

787
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.274
<i>Instead, he and Begbie just hung around
my bed-sit looking for things to steal.</i>

788
01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:07.618
<i>I decided to offer them one of London's
most desirable properties.</i>

789
01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.225
<i>But, of course, they weren't paying any rent.</i>

790
01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:39.058
<i>So when my boss found
two desperate suckers who would,</i>

791
01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:41.814
<i>Sick Boy and Begbie
were bound to feel threatened.</i>

792
01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:47.442
Yep. Lots of storage.
All mod cons, 320 quid a week.

793
01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.620
<i>And that was that.</i>

794
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.116
<i>But by then we had another reason
to go back.</i>

795
01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:57.580
<i>Tommy.</i>

796
01:10:57.837 --> 01:11:01.751
<i>Tommy knew he'd got the virus, like,
but he never knew he'd gone full-blown.</i>

797
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.841
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?

798
01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:08.963
No, toxoplasmosis. It's like a stroke.

799
01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:10.971
How's that?

800
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.467
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

801
01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.012
She would not let him near the house.

802
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.852
So he bought her a present.
He brought her this kitten.

803
01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.817
<i>But Lizzy told him
where to fucking stick it?</i>

804
01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.269
<i>Exactly.</i>

805
01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:27.152
<i>"I'm not wanting a cat,"
she says, "Get to fuck, right."</i>

806
01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:31.952
So there's Tommy, stuck with this kitten.
You can imagine what happened.

807
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:34.120
To those of us gathered here today,

808
01:11:34.832 --> 01:11:38.951
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

809
01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:40.623
Thomas was a son...

810
01:11:40.713 --> 01:11:44.547
The thing was neglected,
pissing and shitting all over the place.

811
01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:49.049
Tommy was lying about, fucked out
of his eyeballs on smack or downers.

812
01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:52.723
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

813
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.885
...a loving man
who had a great lust for life.

814
01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:01.852
- Neither did I. What is it?
- Fucking horrible.

815
01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:06.232
- It's like an abscess in your brain.
- Fucking hell!

816
01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.483
Then what happened?

817
01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:12.822
<i>He starts getting these headaches,
so he just uses more smack, for the pain.</i>

818
01:12:13.746 --> 01:12:16.989
<i>And then he has a stroke. A fucking stroke.</i>

819
01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.699
<i>Just like that.</i>

820
01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:23.416
<i>He gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.</i>

821
01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:27.671
<i>He'd been dead for ages before the
neighbours complained about the smell</i>

822
01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.593
<i>and got the police to break down the door.</i>

823
01:12:30.722 --> 01:12:33.009
<i>Tommy was lying face down
in a pool of vomit.</i>

824
01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:37.218
<i>He has gone from us, but we have
many things to remember him by.</i>

825
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:39.435
The kitten was fine.

826
01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:42.602
Would you all please rise now
for the committal?

827
01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:50.443
<i>Did you think I would leave you crying</i>

828
01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:55.202
<i>When there's room on my horse for two</i>

829
01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:00.958
<i>Climb up here, Tommy, don't be dying</i>

830
01:13:01.586 --> 01:13:05.250
<i>I can go just as fast with two</i>

831
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:10.467
<i>When we grow up, we'll both be soldiers</i>

832
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:14.804
<i>And our horses will not be toys</i>

833
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:20.469
<i>And I wonder if we'll remember</i>

834
01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:24.647
<i>When we were two little boys</i>

835
01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:29.815
- Tommy.
- Tommy.

836
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:36.905
Did you tell him yet?

837
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:38.991
On you go.

838
01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.284
What?

839
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.084
There's this mate of Swanney's.
You know the guy, Mikey Forrester.

840
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.331
Aye.

841
01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.840
He's come into some gear.

842
01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.676
- A lot of gear.
- How much gear?

843
01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:59.807
About two kilos. So he tells me.

844
01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:04.187
He got drunk in a pub
down by the docks last week

845
01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:06.480
where he met two Russian sailors.

846
01:14:07.026 --> 01:14:11.111
<i>They're fucking carrying the stuff.
For sale there and then, like.</i>

847
01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:16.033
So, he wakes up next morning,
realises what he's done,

848
01:14:16.119 --> 01:14:19.862
gets very fucking nervous.
He wants rid of this, right?

849
01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.120
So?

850
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.789
So, he met me,

851
01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:26.876
and I offered to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price

852
01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:30.372
with the intention of punting it
on myself to a guy I know in London.

853
01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:33.379
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral

854
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.881
and you're talking about a skag deal?

855
01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:38.718
Aye.

856
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.511
What was your price?

857
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.892
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand.

858
01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:50.062
- We're 2,000 short.
- Well, that's tough.

859
01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:54.654
Look, Mark, every cunt knows
you've been saving up down in London.

860
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.653
I'm sorry, boys, I do not have two grand.

861
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.742
Aye, you fucking do.

862
01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.325
I've seen your bank statement.

863
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.248
For fuck's sake.

864
01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:10.163
£2,133.

865
01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:13.256
Two kilos. What is that, ten years?

866
01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:17.510
Mikey Forrester, Russian sailors,
what the fuck are you boys on?

867
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.341
Spud, you've already been to jail.

868
01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.844
What's the deal?
You like it so much, you want to go back?

869
01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.100
I just want the money, Mark.

870
01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:29.268
If everybody keeps their fucking mouth
shut, there'll be no cunt going to jail.

871
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:36.279
<i>I hadn't told anyone everything
that was running through my mind</i>

872
01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.947
<i>about what might happen in London.</i>

873
01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:41.197
<i>There were a lot of possibilities
I didn't want to talk to anyone about.</i>

874
01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.449
<i>Ideas best kept to myself.</i>

875
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.622
<i>What no one told me
was that when we bought the smack,</i>

876
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:49.622
<i>some lucky punter would have to try it out.</i>

877
01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:57.713
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.
Sick Boy was too careful these days.</i>

878
01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:02.468
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve, I spiked my vein,
and I did what had to be done.</i>

879
01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:10.810
It's good. Oh, it's really fucking good.

880
01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.321
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

881
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.404
<i>I promised myself another one
before we got to London.</i>

882
01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:26.660
<i>Just the one hit, just for old times' sake.
Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

883
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.540
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

884
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:32.502
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams,</i>

885
01:16:32.588 --> 01:16:36.752
<i>being perpetrated with three of the most
useless and unreliable fuckups in town.</i>

886
01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:39.671
<i>I knew what was going on in his mind.</i>

887
01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:42.470
<i>Any trouble in London,
and he would dump us immediately.</i>

888
01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.843
<i>One way or another, he had to.</i>

889
01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:48.969
<i>If he got caught with a bag full of smack
on top of that armed robbery shit,</i>

890
01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.680
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

891
01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:57.019
<i>Begbie was hard. But not so hard that
he didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.</i>

892
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.862
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

893
01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:11.374
<i>But let's be clear about this.
There's final hits and final hits.</i>

894
01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:14.035
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

895
01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:21.759
- Did you bring the cards?
- What?

896
01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.754
The cards, the last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

897
01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:26.885
I've not brought them.

898
01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:31.845
It's fucking boring after a while
without the cards.

899
01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.054
I'm sorry.

900
01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:36.399
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

901
01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:40.228
'Cause I fucking told you to bring them,
you doss cunt!

902
01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.821
Christ.

903
01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.238
These are your friends, right?

904
01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.118
These are the guys
I told you about.

905
01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.324
Okay.

906
01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.743
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

907
01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:38.874
You didn't get followed or nothing, did you?

908
01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:40.955
We didn't get followed.

909
01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.211
Okay.

910
01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.400
- All right.
- Hi.

911
01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:07.110
<i>Straight away he clocked us
for what we were.</i>

912
01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.863
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

913
01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:22.501
Excuse me, gentlemen.

914
01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:19.808
So, how much would you like for this?

915
01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:24.479
20,000.

916
01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:29.777
I don't think it's worth much more than 15.

917
01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:33.447
<i>This was a real drag to him.
He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

918
01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:36.116
<i>What the fuck were we going to do with it
if he didn't buy it?</i>

919
01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.910
<i>Sell it on the streets? Fuck that.</i>

920
01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:42.911
- Well, 19.
- Terribly sorry, I can't go to 19.

921
01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.923
Well, fucking 16 then.

922
01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.596
Okay. Well, fucking 16 it is then.

923
01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.767
These, gentlemen, are £2,000 bundles.

924
01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:03.810
That's two.

925
01:21:04.944 --> 01:21:06.730
That's four.

926
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.152
<i>We settled on £16,000.</i>

927
01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:12.569
<i>He had a lot more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

928
01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:14.825
...make eight.

929
01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:22.451
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

930
01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:25.328
I'd just like to say it's been a pleasure
haggling with you.

931
01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:27.000
Fucking brand new, by the way.

932
01:21:30.177 --> 01:21:31.258
Okay?

933
01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:34.553
Yes!

934
01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.173
Fucking...

935
01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:40.639
<i>And just for a moment
it felt really great.</i>

936
01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:44.309
<i>Like we were all in it together,
like friends, like it meant something.</i>

937
01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:46.895
<i>A moment like that,
it can touch you deep inside.</i>

938
01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:50.149
<i>But it doesn't last long. Not like £16,000.</i>

939
01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.400
So, what about you, Spud?

940
01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.322
Any major investments on the horizon at all?

941
01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.400
Going to buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

942
01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.905
What, for four fucking grand?

943
01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:59.533
One palm tree, a couple of rocks
and a fucking sewage outflow.

944
01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:04.246
I don't know, man.

945
01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:06.589
I'm going to get something for my ma,
I think.

946
01:22:07.172 --> 01:22:10.381
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

947
01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:13.383
Then get a girl, take her out, treat her right.

948
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:17.304
- And shag her senseless?
- No, man, true love. True love.

949
01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:22.142
But I could really handle some hot sex
with a Jewish princess tonight.

950
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:24.345
- You daft cunt.
- Or a Catholic.

951
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:28.104
If you're going to waste it on a bird,
you might as well fucking leave it all to me.

952
01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.321
- Now get the drinks in.
- I got a round already.

953
01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.066
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

954
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:36.282
Okay. Same again?

955
01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.449
Right.

956
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:39.152
I'm off for a piss.

957
01:22:39.246 --> 01:22:41.704
See when I get back
that money's still here, okay?

958
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:44.043
The moment your back's turned
we're out the door.

959
01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:48.120
- Yeah? I'll be right fucking after you.
- You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard.

960
01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.163
By the way, see, when I get back...

961
01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.337
We'll be halfway down the street
with the money.

962
01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:57.091
- I'd fucking kill you.
- I thought you might, Franco.

963
01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.922
Thought you might.

964
01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.935
Are you game for it?

965
01:23:05.356 --> 01:23:06.437
What?

966
01:23:08.692 --> 01:23:09.932
Well?

967
01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.605
Are you serious?

968
01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:23.200
I don't know. What do you think?

969
01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:28.417
- Still here, I see.
- Aye. We wouldn't run out on a mate.

970
01:23:28.962 --> 01:23:30.748
Why not? I know I would.

971
01:23:31.799 --> 01:23:33.381
Where's Franco?

972
01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:39.804
- For fuck's sake!
- Sorry, mate. I'll buy you another one.

973
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:43.258
You've ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiots.

974
01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:44.763
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

975
01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.060
Sorry is not going to dry me off, you cunt.

976
01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:50.014
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

977
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.528
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.

978
01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:53.776
Fuck you.

979
01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:57.321
If you can't hold a pint you shouldn't be
in the pub, mate. Now, fuck off.

980
01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:14.839
No, Frank, not that, man.

981
01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:17.292
Oh, fuck's sake.

982
01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:20.295
- Fucking nice one, Franco.
- Shut it.

983
01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:23.757
- You cut me, man.
- You were in my fucking way.

984
01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.091
Help!

985
01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:30.896
Anybody else want
to get in my fucking way?

986
01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:32.473
You?

987
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.981
You?

988
01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:42.365
Hey, Rent-boy.

989
01:24:43.871 --> 01:24:46.283
You bring me down a fucking smoke.

990
01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:49.616
- I think we'd better go, Franco.
- I've got to go to the hospital, man.

991
01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:52.998
You're not going to any fucking hospital.
You're staying there.

992
01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:58.499
You bring me down a fucking cigarette.

993
01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.556
And the bag.

994
01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:40.430
<i>Now I've justified this to myself
in all sorts of ways.</i>

995
01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:43.232
<i>It wasn't a big deal, just a minor betrayal.</i>

996
01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:47.278
<i>Or we'd outgrown each other,
you know, that sort of thing.</i>

997
01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:51.240
<i>But let's face it, I ripped them off,
my so-called mates.</i>

998
01:28:51.451 --> 01:28:53.738
<i>But, Begbie, I couldn't give a shit about him.</i>

999
01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:58.448
<i>And Sick Boy would have done the same
to me if he'd only thought of it first.</i>

1000
01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:03.502
<i>And Spud, okay, I felt sorry for Spud.
He never hurt anybody.</i>

1001
01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:11.423
Bastard!

1002
01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.269
Bastard!

1003
01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:28.027
Right. Move away, everybody.

1004
01:29:28.113 --> 01:29:30.104
What's going on in there?

1005
01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.782
Open up. Open up now!

1006
01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.452
Bastard!

1007
01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.872
<i>So, why did I do it?</i>

1008
01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:43.826
<i>I could offer a million answers, all false.</i>

1009
01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:46.044
<i>The truth is that I'm a bad person.</i>

1010
01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:49.465
<i>But that is going to change.
I'm going to change.</i>

1011
01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:51.633
<i>This is the last of that sort of thing.</i>

1012
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:55.554
<i>Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on,
going straight and choosing life.</i>

1013
01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:58.011
<i>I'm looking forward to it already.</i>

1014
01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.180
<i>I'm going to be just like you.</i>

1015
01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.724
<i>The job, the family,
the fucking big television.</i>

1016
01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:06.603
<i>The washing machine, the car,
the compact disc, an electrical tin opener,</i>

1017
01:30:06.693 --> 01:30:09.276
<i>good health, low cholesterol,
dental insurance,</i>

1018
01:30:09.362 --> 01:30:12.946
<i>mortgage, starter home, leisure wear,
luggage, three-piece suite,</i>

1019
01:30:13.033 --> 01:30:17.527
<i>DIY, game shows, junk food, children,
walks in the park, 9:00 to 5:00,</i>

1020
01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:21.200
<i>good at golf, washing the car,
choice of sweaters, family Christmas,</i>

1021
01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.950
<i>indexed pension, tax exemption,
clearing gutters,</i>

1022
01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:26.661
<i>getting by, looking ahead, the day you die.</i>
