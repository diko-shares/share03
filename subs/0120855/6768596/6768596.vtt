179
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.120
We got a tiny, little,
itsy-bitsy problem here, okay?

180
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.320
Personally, I'd love
to hang out with you.
You know I would.

181
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.480
But the guys... they need
a little convincing, you know?

182
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.320
- Okay, what do I gotta do?
- Do? What do you gotta do?

183
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.600
- [laughing] It's so stupid.
- What?

184
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.400
Well, you gotta...
you gotta go get a hair.

185
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.400
- A hair?
- [Terk] Yeah, a hair.

186
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.000
- Uh-huh.
- [trumpeting]

187
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.560
An elephant hair.

188
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.320
[angry trumpeting]

189
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.680
An elephant hair?

190
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.440
Like I said,
it's stupid, right?

191
00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.240
Listen, take it from me.
Go home. Okay?

192
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.440
Who needs this aggravation?

193
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.120
You know, I'm probably
gonna leave soon myself.

194
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.160
You go, I'll catch up,
all right?

195
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.400
You see? Leave it to me.
I told you I could...

196
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.920
- Tarzan! Tarzan!
- [Tarzan shouting]

197
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.680
No!

198
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.600
[all] Oooh!

199
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.320
That one hurt him.

200
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.080
Look! Oh! Oh! There he is!

201
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.720
He's alive!

202
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.720
- Hey, guys!
- [all] Hi.

203
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.240
- [laughter]
- [Terk] Oh, no. No, no.

204
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.720
Come back! Come back.

205
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.320
This guy's great.

206
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.240
If he lives, you should
bring him around more often.

207
00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.920
Come on, come on.
Let's go get a better seat.

208
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.600
[elephant] You can never get
enough sleep, let me tell you.

209
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.200
- [elephant 2] I get enough.
- Mom?

210
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.920
[elephant] It burns up
the calories.

211
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.240
Are you sure
this water's sanitary?

212
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.200
It looks questionable to me.

213
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.400
It's fine, honey.

214
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.560
Ick! But what about bacteria?

215
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:08.280
Tantor, can't you see
Mummy's talking?

216
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.400
[gasps]

217
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.240
[elephants chatting]

218
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.320
Huh! Watch out!
There's something swimming!

219
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.880
It's coming right at you!

220
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.120
Honey, Mummy's
losing her patience.

221
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.520
But this time
I really see something.

222
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.640
[mom] Oh, boy.

223
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.440
Piranha! It's a piranha!

224
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.000
Sweetheart, there are no
piranhas in Africa.

225
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.560
Don't tell the kid that.

226
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.520
Of course there are
piranhas in Africa.

227
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.440
No, she's right.
They're native
to South America.

228
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.040
- Get outta here.
- It's true.

229
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.640
- No way.
- Come on, now.

230
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.480
Think I'd be here
if there were?

231
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.600
Ah! It's right behind you!
Run!

232
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.520
For the last time, honey,
there are no piranhas in...

233
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.000
My butt!

234
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.040
Told you!

235
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.280
There's something on my butt!

236
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.040
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

237
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.840
Ah!

238
00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.880
- What is it?
- It's a piranha.

239
00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
[gasping]

240
00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.680
[all] Piranha!

241
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.360
Tantor, where are you?

242
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.840
- He's dead.
- [trumpeting]

243
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.880
We're dead!

244
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.720
We didn't do it!
They're the ones!

245
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.360
[screeching]

246
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.600
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

247
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.880
Tarzan, buddy!
Buddy, come on!

248
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.200
Tarzan, don't die on me!
Don't die on me!

249
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.400
You weren't supposed to do it!

250
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.680
Get away from there.

251
00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.680
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh
in seconds?

252
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:11.040
What? He's not a piranha!
He's...

253
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.280
- [coughing]
- [Terk] He's alive!

254
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.600
He's alive! He's alive!

255
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.640
- He's alive!
- He's...

256
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.080
You idiot!

257
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.080
You nearly gave me a
heart attack! You happy?

258
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.160
Uh-huh.

259
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.560
You...

260
00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.920
I don't believe it.
You got the hair?

261
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.760
Is that what
this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

262
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.720
- [Kala] Tarzan?
- [ape mother] Terkina?

263
00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.240
[Terk] Oh, no.

264
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.920
- Who's that?
- [both] My mom.

265
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.600
- [Kala] Tarzan.
- Hi.

266
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.040
- Hi, Aunt Kala.
- Oh, you scared me!

267
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.320
- What happened?
- Well, I...

268
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.440
Um, it's sort of a long...
It's involved.

269
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.680
Because what happened,
it was a weird...

270
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.720
What happened?

271
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.320
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan.

272
00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.160
We were playing, and...
Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak.

273
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.280
You almost killed someone.

274
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.520
- It was an accident.
- He's only a child.

275
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.080
That's no excuse.
You can't keep defending him.

276
00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.200
But he'll learn.

277
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.120
He will not. You can't
learn to be one of us.

278
00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:14.000
- You never give him a chance.
- Give him a chance?

279
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.120
[Kerchak] Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

280
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.080
[Kala] Kerchak!

281
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.480
Tarzan.

282
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.960
[sighs]

283
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.920
[panting, shouting]

284
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.120
[grunting]

285
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.640
Tarzan,
what are you doing?

286
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.040
Why am I so different?

287
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.280
Because you're covered
with mud, that's why.

288
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.200
No! Kerchak said
I didn't belong in...

289
00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.480
[Kala] Close your mouth.

290
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.840
Kerchak said I don't
belong in the family.

291
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.360
Never mind what Kerchak said.

292
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.320
- Hold still.
- But look at me!

293
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.720
I am, Tarzan.

294
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.520
And do you know what I see?

295
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.000
I see two eyes, like mine,

296
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.520
and a nose, somewhere. Ah!

297
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.040
Here.

298
00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.840
Two ears.

299
00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.360
- And let's see, what else?
- Two hands?

300
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.080
That's right. [laughs]

301
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.120
[sighs]

302
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.000
Close your eyes.

303
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.480
Now, forget what you see.

304
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.480
What do you feel?

305
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.240
My heart.

306
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.200
Come here.

307
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.760
- Your heart.
- See?

308
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.360
We're exactly the same.

309
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.880
Kerchak just can't see that.

310
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.960
I'll make him see it.

311
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.840
I'll be the best ape ever.

- Hey, Auntie K.

351
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.800
You're looking
remarkably groomed today.

352
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.640
- Hello, Terk.
- [roars]

353
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.240
[Terk] Not the neck!
Not the neck there, T.

354
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.680
[Terk] Watch it! Oh! Ow!

355
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.160
Okay, it's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

356
00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.840
[Tantor] Please stop.
Somebody's gonna
get hurt here.

357
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.480
- [Tantor] And it's always me.
- [Terk] Cramp in the calf.

358
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.000
- Please!
- Okay. Okay, you win.

359
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.520
Ow! Okay, okay, you win.
Hello! Down here.
Yo, yo! Let go!

360
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.560
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

361
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.320
You know, I been thinking
lately that maybe Tarzan

362
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.480
could be some
subspecies of elephant.

363
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.520
[Terk] What are you, crazy?
An elephant?

364
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.480
[Tantor] Listen to me.
Think about it. He enjoys
a peanut, I enjoy a peanut.

365
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.360
He looks nothing like you.

366
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.200
[roaring]

367
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.080
[low growling]

368
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.840
- [ferocious roar]
- Ahhhh!

369
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.600
[apes screeching, hooting]

370
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.120
[Tarzan yelps]

371
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.600
[rustling]

372
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.560
[grunting]

373
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.040
[triumphant grunting]

374
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.480
[Tarzan yells]

375
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.800
[Terk] Okay everybody,
move aside. Outta my way.

376
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.040
Best friend coming through.
That would be me.

377
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.240
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

378
00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.840
There are other ways
of getting attention.

379
00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.840
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

380
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.120
I was right behind you
if you needed me.
I had you covered.

381
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.040
[gunshot]

382
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.200
[birds crying]

383
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.240
What was that?

384
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.040
I... It wasn't me, I swear.

385
00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.880
- [Tantor] Okay, maybe it was.
- [Kerchak] Everyone,

386
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.680
let's move.

387
00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.440
[apes grunting]

388
00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.720
[gunshot]

389
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.440
[sniffing]

390
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.200
- [coughing, choking]
- [gunshot]

391
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.320
[Clayton] I was reminded of a
safari I led up the Zambezi.

392
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.520
Marvelous.
Lots of hunting, yes.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

393
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.520
Wildebeest everywhere.

394
00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.800
Two bearers loading
three rifles for me,
blasting away.

395
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.480
That's when I knew
I was born for Africa

396
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.600
and Africa was created for...

397
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.320
[gunshot]

398
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.320
[Porter] Clayton?

399
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.680
[panting] Clayton...
Oh, there you are.

400
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.720
What is it?
What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

401
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.480
I thought I saw something.

402
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.120
Is it a Hippopotamus
amphibious or
a Rhinoceros bihornus?

403
00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.760
[Clayton] Professor,
don't move!

404
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.960
- Oh, right.
- [Jane] Daddy?

405
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.240
Ow, ow, ow!

406
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.720
Daddy, what's all
the hullabaloo about? [grunts]

407
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.920
[Jane] Ow! Ah!

408
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.360
What is it, Daddy?

409
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.480
Mr. Clayton asked me not
to move. He saw something.

410
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.560
Uh... Ooh!

411
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.920
I moved.

412
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.880
Uh, Mr. Clayton?
Sorry, excuse me.

413
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.480
But my father and I came
on this expedition
to study gorillas,

414
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.560
and I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

415
00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:32.040
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter,

416
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.160
and protect you I shall.

417
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.400
And you're doing
a marvelous job of it.

418
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.720
But we only
have a short time

419
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.200
before the ship returns,
you see...

420
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.800
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

421
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.320
- A gorilla's nest!
- [gasps] Daddy!

422
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.800
At last!
Our first sign in days.

423
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.520
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

424
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.720
Could be. Why, I mean,
there's the evidence.

425
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.240
[Porter stammering] They
can't be very far, anyway.

426
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.040
Look! Over there and there...

427
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.760
[Porter] Where?
Yes, more nests!

428
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.720
- I see them!
- Just as you predicted!

429
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.360
Family groups!

430
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.400
Oh, Jane, I love you.

431
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.480
- [laughter]
- Family groups?

432
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.320
[laughing] Excuse me,
but these are wild beasts

433
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.240
that would sooner tear your
head off than look at you.

434
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.400
On the contrary, Mr. Clayton.

435
00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.840
Daddy's theory is that
these are social creatures,
not monsters.

436
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.080
[bird squawking]

437
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.840
Mr. Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

438
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.920
It's no gorilla.

439
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.320
Mmm.
Perhaps we should press on.

440
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.440
Yes, indeed.

441
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480
Now, we should keep
heading west,

442
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.280
following
the Ganoderma ablonatum.

443
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.120
[Clayton]
Excellent, professor.

444
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.160
I could've used your expertise
on my last safari.

445
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.120
I was in the mountainous
region of Zambia.

446
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.440
- [cries out] Oh!
- [Clayton]
Yes, very dangerous.

447
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.360
Oh!

448
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.520
Are you what all
the fuss was about?

449
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.520
[whispering] Daddy!
Daddy, quick!

450
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.720
No, wait. Hold still.

451
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.280
Oh, my good...

452
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.120
You may not be a gorilla,
but you are
one sweet little...

453
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.560
There you go.
What do you think?

454
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.120
[squeals]

455
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.680
What? Oh!

456
00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.400
[Jane] Why, you little...

457
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.560
Well, this is
absolutely peachy.
Come to study gorillas

458
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.160
and get my sketchbook
pinched by a baboon.

459
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.720
[grunting, laughing]

460
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.160
Give me that!

461
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.600
Come on now, enough of this.

462
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.640
I want this paper
on the count of three.

463
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.280
One.

464
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.160
Two.

465
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.440
Oh, look, bananas!

466
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.400
[laughing] I can't believe
you fell for that one.

467
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.920
[crying]

468
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

469
00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.840
What would your parents
have to say?

470
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.120
- [roaring]
- [yelps]

471
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400
You see, I told you
they'd be cross.

472
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.360
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

473
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.560
[Jane] I'm flying!

474
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.120
What on earth am I...
[gasps, screams]

475
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.840
[Jane] Get off! Get off!

476
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.600
Put me down! Put me down!

477
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.080
[Jane] No, pick me up,
pick me up!

478
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.800
[Jane] Help!

479
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.720
Oh, no!

480
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.280
[Jane screaming]

481
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.320
[laughing]

482
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.080
Unhand me, monkey!

483
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.120
Over there!

484
00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.120
[chattering]

485
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.280
[chattering]

486
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.840
[panting]

487
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.320
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

488
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.360
I can't do this. I can't...

489
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.120
Oh! This is good.
This is very good.

490
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.320
I... Oh! Wait.

491
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.600
One, two. [yelps]

492
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.560
It can't get any worse,
can it?

493
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.240
[thunder crashes]

494
00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.240
Obviously it can.

495
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.360
[shrieks]

496
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.720
Stay back. No, don't...
Don't come any closer.

497
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.040
Please, don't.

498
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.760
What are you...
What are you doing?

499
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.080
[laughing] No, please don't.
That tickles.

500
00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.040
No, get off, get off.
Get off!

501
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.640
[Jane] It serves you right.

502
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.200
Stay away from me,
like a very good wild man.

503
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.720
You stay. I'm warning you.

504
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.680
My father won't
take kindly to you...

505
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.000
No. That's...
Now, that's close enough.

506
00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:30.360
How dare you? What...?

507
00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.200
[gasps] Oh! Um...

508
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.280
- [heartbeat]
- Oh...

509
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.160
Oh, dear.

510
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.560
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

511
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.480
Yes, thank you.

512
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.480
That's a lovely heartbeat.
It's very nice.

513
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.680
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

514
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.240
I can't do a thing with it
in this humidity though.
It's...

515
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.720
You do speak!

516
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.240
All this time
I thought you were

517
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.720
a big, wild, quiet,
silent person thing.

518
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.120
Why didn't you tell me?

519
00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.960
I must say I'm rather curious
as to who you are. I'd love...

520
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.880
[grunts] Tarzan.

521
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.120
Tarzan.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.680
Moves like an ape,
but looks like a man.

695
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.720
He could be the missing link.

696
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.000
Or our link to the gorillas.

697
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.840
Ah! Yes, yes.

698
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:35.200
[clears throat]
Where are the gorillas?

699
00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.400
Go-ri-llas!

700
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.400
Go-ri-llas!

701
00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.280
Shouting won't help,
Mr. Clayton.

702
00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.080
He doesn't
understand English.

703
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.040
Then I'll make him understand.

704
00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.880
If I can teach a parrot
to sing God Save the Queen,

705
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.880
I can certainly teach
this savage a thing or two.

706
00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.920
Gorilla.

707
00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.960
Gorilla.

708
00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:01.600
- [chuckles] He's got it!
- Gorilla.

709
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.640
- Go-ril-la.
- Perhaps not.

710
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.920
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, no, no!

711
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:10.520
Gimme that. Leave it.

712
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.800
Mr. Clayton, I think

The boat could arrive any day.
Now, ask him straight out.

744
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.400
Tarzan, will you take us
to the gorillas?

745
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.560
[Jane] Do you understand?

746
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.760
I understand.

747
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.760
- Good work, Jane.
- Well?

748
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.280
- I can't.
- What?

749
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.560

Oh, Terk,
I've never seen him so happy.

756
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.520
Yeah? I give it a week.

757
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.160
- [man 1] Aye, cut her loose!
- [man 2] Come on,
pull it down.

758
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.440
[man 3] All right,
move it, ya bilge rats!

759
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.920
[man 4] Heave ho, lads.

760
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.240
[man 5] Put your back in it.
All right, move it.

761
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.080
[Porter] Please, don't...
I've waited 30 years for this

762
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.680
and I won't leave
until I see a gorilla.

763
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.000
Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?
No! No, no, wait!

764
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.280
[man 6] Pick your barrel up.
Pick it up.

765
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.360
[man 7] Here we go.
Here we go.

766
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:32.960
[Clayton] You're the captain.
Tell them you've
had engine trouble,

767
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:34.520
and give us two more days.

768
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.040
And be late at every port
from here to London?

769
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.640
We'll have come for nothing.

770
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.440
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

771
00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.080
[groans] This is your fault.

772
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.880
I should've
followed my instincts

773
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.640
and set traps for the beasts.

774
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.520
Don't you think
I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

775
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.240
You are absolutely impossible!
[gasps]

776
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:57.880
Tarzan. I was so afraid that
you wouldn't come in time.

777
00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.200
The boat's arrived.

778
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.400
The boat that's come
to take us home, to England.

779
00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:06.880
And Daddy and I were...
Well, I was wondering...

780
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.080
Well, we really hope
that you'll come with us.

781
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.560
Won't you?

782
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:15.880
Go see England today.
Come home tomorrow.

783
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.920
Oh, no.

784
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.240
Well, see, it would be very
difficult to come back...

785
00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.560
...ever.

786
00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.200
Not come back?

787
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.240
I know it sounds awful,
but you belong with us,
with people.

788
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.280
Jane must stay with Tarzan.

789
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.720
Stay here? Oh, no, no, no...
My laundry.

790
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.240
No, I can't stay.
Look, I've got...

791
00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.720
I'm with my father, and...

792
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.520
Jane... stay.

793
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.880
- But...
- Please.

794
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.800
But, I can't.

795
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:53.160
[sobbing]

796
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.240
[Clayton] Women.
[chuckles]

797
00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:58.120
How typical.
Thank you, Jones.

798
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.200
Even if you hadn't grown up
a savage, you'd be lost.

799
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.760
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

800
00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.400
- Jane is going.
- Yes.

801
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:13.600
If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

802
00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.960
She's so disappointed.

803
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.800
Crushed, really.

804
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.880
Sorry, old boy.

805
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:25.360
Oh, well, I'd best get
Jane's things to the ship.

806
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.640
Clayton.

807
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.400
If Jane sees gorillas,
she stays?

808
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.200
Say, that's why she came,
isn't it?

809
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.000
- I'll do it.
- Good man!

810
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.560
- Snipes?
- Sir?

811
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.320
Get the boys together. There's
gonna be a change in plans.

812
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.400
Terk, just get
Kerchak out of the way.

813
00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.440
- What?
- I'd be happy to get...

814
00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.120
Hey! Shut your trunk
and get me out of here.

815
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.520
[Terk]
Can you believe that guy?

816
00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.000
Drops us like a newborn
giraffe, kerplop!

817
00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.520
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

818
00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.200
Terk, I'm asking you
as a friend.

819
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.840
[groans]

820
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:16.720
With the face and the eyes
and the...

821
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:21.360
All right! But don't make me
do anything embarrassing.

822
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.080
I'm gonna kill him!!

823
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.480
I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

824
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.400
Really? I thought it was
a little revealing
and kind of...

825
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.360
- [loud roar]
- [screaming]

826
00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.880
How does she move
in this thing?

827
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.280
[Terk] Look out!

828
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.840
- Look, Daddy!
- [stammering] Where?

829
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.920
Jane. [panting]

830
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.360
[Clayton] Now, be careful,
professor.

831
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.200
[Porter] Mustn't,
mustn't frighten.

832
00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.480
She's beautiful.

833
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.720
She's my mother.

834
00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:26.120
But... This is your...

835
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.120
...mother?

836
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.320
[soft hooting]

837
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.920
- [stammering]
What's happening?
- I don't know, Daddy.

838
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.120
Oh! It's getting away!

839
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.720
No! You'll only
frighten her more.

840
00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.880
[hooting]

841
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.120
Yes, absolutely, my dear.
Good idea.

842
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.360
What are you doing?
Want to frighten them?

843
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.600
Get up. Get...

844
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.920
Don't get up.

845
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:29.160
[stammering] Oh!

846
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:33.840
[grunting]

847
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.320
Hello.

848
00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.840
It's very nice
to meet you, too.

849
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.200
Oh, Your Majesty,
you're such a tease.

850
00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.080
Whoa! Hello. Hello.

851
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.240
Archimedes Q. Porter
at your service.

852
00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.840
Quite a grip you've got.

853
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.160
Oh, thank you, yes.
Is that one of mine?

854
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.640
This is wonderful,
Mr. Clayton!

855
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.360
Look, look! Social grooming.

856
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.640
Congratulations, professor.

857
01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.960
Our dream has come true.

858
01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:21.200
Give me that!

859
01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.720
Hey, what are you doing?
Now, stop that! Stop!

860
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.360
Hold on now. Leave that!

861
01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.640
That is not to be played with!

862
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.880
Can you teach me?

863
01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.240
- Speak gorilla?
- Hmm. Yes.

Good heavens, what did I say?

866
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.440
That Jane stays with Tarzan.

867
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.920
Stay? But I...
I thought we'd already...

868
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.640
- Tarzan, I...
- [Terk] Whoa!

869
01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.320
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

[roaring]

871
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.360
[Jane] Daddy.

872
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.760
Give it to me!

873
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:43.920
Go!

874
01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.480
Go!

875
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.040
Wait, wait! Tarzan!

876
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.320
Go now!

877
01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.640
Jane, quickly! Hurry!
Come along!

878
01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.280
[both panting]

879
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.840
Kerchak, I didn't...
I'm sorry, I...

880
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.520
I asked you
to protect our family.

881
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.680
And you betrayed us all.

882
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.200
I'm so confused.

883
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.400
Come with me.

884
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.760
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

885
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.960
[glass breaking]

886
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.480
Is this me?

887
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.760
And this is my father,

888
01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.360
and...

889
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.240
and my...

890
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.800
Now you know.

891
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.240
Tarzan, I just want you
to be happy,

892
01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.040
whatever you decide.

893
01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.720
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

894

[sobbing]

895
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.720
And you will always be
in my heart.

896

- [Jane] Tarzan!
- [men shouting]

898
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.200
I'm so glad you
found us in time.

Tarzan!

900
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.480
We're too late!
I can't believe it!

901
01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:44.680
If you had pulled over
and asked for directions...

902
01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.800
We didn't get to say goodbye.

903
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.240
Well, good riddance,
all right?
Who needs you, huh?

904
01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.400
Go on, get out of here,
bald boy!

905
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.320
You, you ingrate!
You bald ingrate!

906
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.400
Go on and rot, for all I care!

What are you looking at?

909
01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.200
I'm gonna miss him, too.

910
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.560
[Jane] Tarzan,
you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

911
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.920
You'll see the world.

912
01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.720
Everyone's going
to want to meet you.

913
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.960
Kings, scientists,
famous writers.

914
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:25.320
Yes. Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria!

915
01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.720
I haven't met her,
but I heard she's nice.

916
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.440
And I'll be with Jane?

917
01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.360
Yes, with Jane.
[chuckles]

918
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.600

Clayton! Clayton, help!

926
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.080
Have we met?

927
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:47.240
Ah, yes, the ape man.

928
01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.400
Clayton, you...

929
01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.560
You...

930
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.760
So sorry about the rude
welcome, old boy,

931
01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.880
but I couldn't have you
making a scene

932
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:02.040
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

933
01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.640
Why?

934
01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.400
Why?

935
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.240
For three hundred pounds
sterling a head.

936
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.720
Actually, I have you
to thank, my boy.

937
01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.880
Couldn't have done it
without you.

938
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.240
Lock him up with the others.

939
01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:22.280
No!

940
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.640
That sounded like Tarzan.

941
01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.040
He sounded like
he was in trouble.

942
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.120
Yeah, well, why doesn't
he get his new friends

943
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.680
to help him?
I don't care.

944
01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.080
That's it!

945
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:38.240
I've had it with you
and your emotional
constipation!

946
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.280
Tarzan needs us
and we're gonna help him!

947
01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:45.400
You got that? Now, pipe down
and hang on tight!

948
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:47.600
We've got a boat to catch.

949

Good! 'Cause I'm
gonna kill you!

952
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.960
No time for that now, missy.

Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

956
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.960
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

957
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.160
Clayton betrayed us all.
I'm so sorry, Tarzan.

958
01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.920
No, I did this.

959
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.480
I betrayed my family.
Kerchak was right.

960
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:55.360
Those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages.

961
01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.320
What is this world coming to?

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.520
Oh, by Jove!
Don't know my own strength.

What was that?

- [Terk] You are an animal!
- [trumpets]

966
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:19.520
That sounded
just like an elephant.

967
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.800
Tantor!

968
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.600
Thanks, guys.

969
01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.560
I thought I would never
see you again!

970
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.000
And here you are.

971
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.320

will be better off stuffed.

You there! Take what you can
back to the boat.

982
01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.160
Aye, aye, sir.

983
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.040

I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

987
01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.920
This should do the trick.

- Good!
- Clayton, you...

994
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:49.760

Because after
I get rid of you,

Kerchak, forgive me.

No.

1008
01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.080
Forgive me
for not understanding

1009
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:21.480
that you have always
been one of us.

1010

[Kerchak] Our family
will look to you now.

1011

No, Kerchak.

London will seem so small
compared to all this.

1016

I will miss you, Jane.

1017
01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:18.320
- Miss Porter!
- I know. I'm coming.

1018
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:24.040
Well... I suppose we
should say goodbye.

Goodbye.

Oh, I'm going to
miss that boy.

Jane, dear,
I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

Please don't. We've been
through all of this.

I couldn't possibly...

I belong in England with you,
with people...

1026
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.760
But you love him.
