00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:43.877
Ah!

2
00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:03.522
<i>Put your faith in what
You most believe in</i>

3
00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:07.651
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

4
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:11.697
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

5
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.493
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

6
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:21.164
<i>A paradise untouched by man</i>

7
00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:24.876
<i>Within this world blessed with love</i>

8
00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:29.881
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

9
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:34.303
<i>Softly tread the sand
Below your feet now</i>

10
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:38.015
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

11
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.850
<i>Trust your heart</i>

12
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.311
<i>Let fate decide</i>

13
00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:47.149
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

14
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.737
<i>Beneath the shelter of the trees</i>

15
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.533
<i>Only love can enter here</i>

16
00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:00.662
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

17
00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:04.416
<i>Raise your head up
Lift high the load</i>

18
00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.545
<i>Take strength from those that need you</i>

19
00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:12.924
<i>Build high the walls
Build strong the beams</i>

20
00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:15.052
<i>A new life is waiting</i>

21
00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.847
<i>But danger's no stranger here</i>

22
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:47.584
<i>No words describe a mother's tears</i>

23
00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:51.838
<i>No words can heal a broken heart</i>

24
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.510
<i>A dream is gone
But where there's hope</i>

25
00:02:56.593 --> 00:03:01.264
<i>Somewhere
Something is calling for you</i>

26
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.685
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

27
00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:09.147
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

28
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:13.402
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

29
00:04:53.335 --> 00:04:54.377
Huh?

30
00:04:54.878 --> 00:04:55.879
Huh?

31
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.647
Ah! Ah! Ah!

32
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:55.558
<i>Every moment now
The bond grows stronger</i>

33
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.020
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

34
00:07:59.062 --> 00:08:03.274
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

35
00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:07.904
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

36
00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.667
Mama, look! Look over there!

37
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.627
- Kala!
- She's back.

38
00:08:23.878 --> 00:08:25.755
We looked everywhere for you.

39
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:31.261
- Are you all right, dear?
- I'm fine. No, really, honestly.

40
00:08:31.302 --> 00:08:35.265
It's just that I got a little bit sidetracked.

41
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.185
Well, isn't that, uh...

42
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.939
- Well, it's so...
- Why, it's just so...

43
00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:45.525
It's freaky-lookin', okay?
That's what it is.

44
00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.777
- Terkina!
- Well, it is!

45
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.155
I mean, what the heck is it anyway?

46
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.614
He's a baby.

47
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.658
Well... Ah!

48
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.577
I can't...

49
00:08:58.413 --> 00:08:59.956
So, where's his mama?

50
00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:02.959
Well, I'm going to be his mother now.

51
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:11.801
You know, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.

52
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:14.971
Kala's gonna be its mother now.

53
00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:23.897
Kerchak, I saved him from Sabor.

54
00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:29.819
Kala, it won't replace the one we lost.

55
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:33.823
I know that. But he needs me.

56
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.452
But it...

57
00:09:37.494 --> 00:09:41.748
Kala, look at it. It's not our kind.

58
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:45.001
No, you have to take it back.

59
00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.879
Take him back? But he'll die.

60
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:50.173
- If the jungle wants him...
- I want him.

61
00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.550
Kala, I cannot let you
put our family in danger.

62
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:54.094
Does he look dangerous to you?

63
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:06.272
Was it alone?

64
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.775
Yes. Sabor killed his family.

65
00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:12.946
- Are you sure?
- Yes. There are no others.

66
00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.242
Then you may keep him.

67
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:21.037
Kerchak, I know he'll be a good son.

68
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:22.872
I said he could stay.

69
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.750
That doesn't make him my son.

70
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.839
We will nest here for the night.

71
00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:38.972
So, um, what you gonna call it?

72
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.558
I'm gonna call him...

73
00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:42.892
Tarzan.

74
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:46.187
Tarzan? Okay, he's your baby.

75
00:10:46.229 --> 00:10:49.440
All right, little lady, come on.
It's way past your nest time.

76
00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:50.984
- Oh, Mom.
- No.

77
00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:54.028
Five more minutes?
Two more minutes?

78
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.072
One more minutes?

79
00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:04.539
Oh! Oh, no. Shh. Shh.

80
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:08.918
Don't cry. I'm here. Come on. Come on.

81
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.421
<i>Come, stop your crying</i>

82
00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:13.256
<i>It will be all right</i>

83
00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:19.095
<i>Just take my hand
Hold it tight</i>

84
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:24.017
<i>I will protect you from all around you</i>

85
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:28.771
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

86
00:11:29.272 --> 00:11:34.444
<i>For one so small
You seem so strong</i>

87
00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:38.615
<i>My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm</i>

88
00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:44.078
<i>This bond between us can't be broken</i>

89
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.333
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

90
00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:52.879
<i>'Cause you'll be in my heart</i>

91
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:57.008
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

92
00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.136
<i>From this day on</i>

93
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.390
<i>Now and forever more</i>

94
00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:12.148
<i>You'll be in my heart</i>

95
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.153
<i>No matter what they say</i>

96
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:21.783
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

97
00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:24.369
<i>Always</i>

98
00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.667
Always.

99
00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.109
Tarzan.

100
00:12:57.026 --> 00:12:59.112
Tarzan?

101
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.324
I sure scared you, Mom.

102
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.576
You sure did.

103
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.829
Can't you imitate any quieter animals?

104
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.956
Oh, Mom, they're no fun.

105
00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:13.376
Wanna see me be a leopard?

106
00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.795
Why don't you just come up
with your own sound?

107
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.630
Hmm.

108
00:13:22.969 --> 00:13:24.846
Kala.

109
00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.476
Oops.

110
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.774
Tarzan! Thank goodness
you're all right!

111
00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:40.653
Kala and I have been so worried.

112
00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:43.614
Thank you. Thank you so much
for finding him, Kerchak.

113
00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:46.743
You are such a wise and caring leader.

114
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.995
Run.

115
00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.331
Um. Hmm.

116
00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:54.709
Hello.

117
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.461
- Are you thick in the head?
- What?

118
00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.379
How many times do I have to tell you?

119
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.883
If you want Kerchak to like you,
stay away from him.

120
00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:03.551
Come on, step on it!

121
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:05.261
Last one there is a dung beetle!

122
00:14:05.345 --> 00:14:07.388
Yeah, the first one's gotta eat it.

123
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.681
Terk, can I come?

124
00:14:08.765 --> 00:14:10.767
Well, you could if you could keep up,

125
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.935
but, you know, you can't really keep up.

126
00:14:13.019 --> 00:14:16.814
Wait up, guys!
Wait up! Right behind you!

127
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:26.741
You're standing on my spleen.

128
00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.785
Take that! Stop hitting yourself.

129
00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.079
- Stop hitting yourself.
- Ow! Ow!

130
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.246
Stop hitting yourself.

131
00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.750
<i>The fun has arrived</i>

132
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.461
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, what took you so long?

133
00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:42.465
I had a little pest control problem,
but it's all taken care of. Whoa!

134
00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.510
Hi, guys.

135
00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:48.012
Terk, what is this, some kind of joke?

136
00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:51.057
Tell me I'm not looking
at the hairless wonder.

137
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.227
Well, Terk said I could come
along if I could keep up.

138
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.522
- Oh! No, no.
- Terk. Come on.

139
00:14:57.605 --> 00:15:01.651
I'll handle this, guys, okay?
Listen, buddy. Come here.

140
00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.946
We got a tiny, little,
itsy-bitsy problem here, okay?

141
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:08.157
Personally, I'd love to hang out
with you. You know I would.

142
00:15:08.199 --> 00:15:11.327
But the guys... They need
a little convincing, you know?

143
00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.079
Okay, what do I gotta do?

144
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.164
Do? What do you gotta do?

145
00:15:15.206 --> 00:15:18.418
- It's so stupid.
- What?

146
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:23.256
Well, you gotta...
You gotta go get a hair.

147
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:25.216
- A hair?
- Yeah, a hair.

148
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.552
Uh-huh.

149
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.346
An elephant hair.

150
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.519
An elephant hair?

151
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:39.355
Like I said, it's stupid, right?

152
00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:42.066
Listen, take it from me.
Go home. Okay?

153
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.277
Who needs this aggravation?

154
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.946
You know, I'm probably
gonna leave soon myself.

155
00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.991
You go, I'll catch up, all right?

156
00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:53.244
You see? Leave it to me.
I told you I could...

157
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:55.746
Tarzan! Tarzan!

158
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.498
No!

159
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.381
Ooh!

160
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:07.091
That one hurt him.

161
00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:26.819
Look! Oh! Oh! There he is!

162
00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:28.654
He's alive!

163
00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:31.491
- Hey, guys!
- Hi.

164
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:34.368
Oh, no. No, no.

165
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.455
Come back! Come back.

166
00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:39.081
This guy's great.

167
00:16:39.165 --> 00:16:42.001
If he lives, you should
bring him around more often.

168
00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:44.921
Come on, come on.
Let's go get a better seat.

169
00:16:47.632 --> 00:16:49.926
You can never get
enough sleep, let me tell you.

170
00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:51.969
- I get enough.
- Mom?

171
00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.095
It burns calories.

172
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.057
Are you sure this water's sanitary?

173
00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.935
It looks questionable to me.

174
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.103
It's fine, honey.

175
00:17:01.938 --> 00:17:05.274
Ick! But what about bacteria?

176
00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:08.986
Tantor, can't you see Mummy's talking?

177
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.035
Huh! Watch out!
There's something swimming!

178
00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.578
It's coming right at you!

179
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:19.789
Honey, Mummy's losing her patience.

180
00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.250
But this time I really see something.

181
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:23.292
Oh, boy.

182
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.128
Piranha! It's a piranha!

183
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.715
Sweetheart, there are no
piranhas in Africa.

184
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:31.133
Don't tell the kid that.

185
00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.219
Of course there are piranhas in Africa.

186
00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:36.138
No, she's right.
They're native to South America.

187
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.765
- Get outta here.
- It's true.

188
00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.350
- No way.
- Come on, now.

189
00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.185
Think I'd be here if there were?

190
00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:43.312
Ah! It's right behind you! Run!

191
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:48.234
For the last time, honey,
there are no piranhas in...

192
00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:49.652
My butt!

193
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.989
- Told you!
- There's something on my butt!

194
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.741
- What is it?
- Are there any more of them?

195
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:57.118
Ah!

196
00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:01.414
- What is it?
- It's a piranha.

197
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:07.295
Piranha!

198
00:18:09.505 --> 00:18:11.007
Tantor, where are you?

199
00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.520
He's dead.

200
00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.522
We're dead!

201
00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.614
We didn't do it! They're the ones!

202
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.217
Oh, thank you, Kerchak.

203
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.723
Tarzan, buddy! Buddy, come on!

204
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.850
Tarzan, don't die on me!
Don't die on me!

205
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.561
- You weren't supposed to do it!
- Get away from there.

206
00:19:05.603 --> 00:19:08.481
Don't you know a piranha
can strip your flesh in seconds?

207
00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:11.817
What? He's not a piranha! He's...

208
00:19:11.901 --> 00:19:14.070
He's alive!

209
00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.405
He's alive! He's alive!

210
00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:18.449
- He's alive!
- He's...

211
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:19.992
You idiot!

212
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.870
You nearly gave me
a heart attack! You happy?

213
00:19:22.912 --> 00:19:23.954
Uh-huh.

214
00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:25.414
You...

215
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.750
I don't believe it. You got the hair?

216
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:32.338
Is that what this is all about?
I got a whole tail of them.

217
00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.507
- Tarzan?
- Terkina?

218
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.092
Oh, no.

219
00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.719
- Who's that?
- My mom.

220
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.388
- Tarzan.
- Hi.

221
00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:42.848
- Hi, Aunt Kala.
- Oh, you scared me!

222
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.101
- What happened?
- Well, I...

223
00:19:45.142 --> 00:19:47.228
Um, it's sort of a long... It's involved.

224
00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:49.480
Because what happened,
it was a weird...

225
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:51.524
What happened?

226
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:57.113
- It was my fault, Kerchak.
- Tarzan.

227
00:19:57.196 --> 00:20:01.951
We were playing, and...
Well, I'm sorry, Kerchak.

228
00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:04.120
You almost killed someone.

229
00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.330
- It was an accident.
- He's only a child.

230
00:20:06.414 --> 00:20:08.874
That's no excuse.
You can't keep defending him.

231
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:10.334
- He'll learn.
- He will not.

232
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:11.961
You can't learn to be one of us.

233
00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:14.797
- You never give him a chance.
- Give him a chance?

234
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.968
Kala, look at him.
He will never be one of us.

235
00:20:19.009 --> 00:20:20.886
Kerchak!

236
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.305
Tarzan.

237
00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:16.358
Tarzan, what are you doing?

238
00:21:17.151 --> 00:21:19.028
Why am I so different?

239
00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:21.238
Because you're covered with mud.

240
00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.157
No! Kerchak said I didn't belong in...

241
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:24.575
Close your mouth.

242
00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.786
Kerchak said I don't
belong in the family.

243
00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:28.370
Never mind what Kerchak said.

244
00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:32.291
- Hold still.
- But look at me!

245
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.712
I am, Tarzan.

246
00:21:36.754 --> 00:21:38.547
And do you know what I see?

247
00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:41.967
I see two eyes, like mine,

248
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:46.472
and a nose, somewhere. Ah!

249
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.057
Here.

250
00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:50.810
Two ears.

251
00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:54.313
- And let's see, what else?
- Two hands?

252
00:21:54.396 --> 00:21:56.065
That's right.

253
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.959
Close your eyes.

254
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:17.503
Now, forget what you see.

255
00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:19.380
What do you feel?

256
00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:22.132
My heart.

257
00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:24.093
Come here.

258
00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.638
- Your heart.
- See?

259
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:30.266
They're exactly the same.

260
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.771
Kerchak just can't see that.

261
00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:39.775
I'll make him see it.

262
00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.736
I'll be the best ape ever.

263
00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:45.072
Oh, I bet you will.

264
00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:02.131
<i>Oh, the power to be strong</i>

265
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:05.968
<i>And the wisdom to be wise</i>

266
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:10.890
<i>All these things will come to you in time</i>

267
00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:15.311
<i>On this journey that you're making</i>

268
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:19.106
<i>There'll be answers that you'll seek</i>

269
00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:22.318
<i>And it's you who'll climb the mountain</i>

270
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:26.488
<i>It's you who'll reach the peak</i>

271
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.658
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

272
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.870
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

273
00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:36.332
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

274
00:23:36.373 --> 00:23:40.377
<i>Son of Man, a man in time you'll be</i>

275
00:23:52.806 --> 00:23:55.893
<i>Though there's no one there
To guide you</i>

276
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:59.647
<i>No one to take your hand</i>

277
00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:02.983
<i>But with faith and understanding</i>

278
00:24:03.025 --> 00:24:06.695
<i>You will journey from boy to man</i>

279
00:24:06.779 --> 00:24:10.199
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

280
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.410
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

281
00:24:13.494 --> 00:24:16.914
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

282
00:24:16.997 --> 00:24:21.877
<i>Son of Man, a man in time you'll be</i>

283
00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:29.718
<i>In learning you will teach</i>

284
00:24:30.094 --> 00:24:33.639
<i>And in teaching you will learn</i>

285
00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:38.519
<i>You'll find your place
Beside the ones you love</i>

286
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.732
<i>And all the things you dreamed of</i>

287
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:47.027
<i>The visions that you saw</i>

288
00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:50.572
<i>Well, the time is drawing near now</i>

289
00:24:50.614 --> 00:24:54.201
<i>It's yours to claim it all</i>

290
00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:57.746
<i>Son of Man, look to the sky</i>

291
00:24:57.788 --> 00:25:00.833
<i>Lift your spirit, set it free</i>

292
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:04.586
<i>Someday you'll walk tall with pride</i>

293
00:25:04.628 --> 00:25:09.675
<i>Son of Man, a man in time you'll be</i>

294
00:25:16.557 --> 00:25:18.142
<i>Son of Man</i>

295
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:23.105
<i>Son of Man's a man for all to see</i>

296
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:42.875
Don't even think about it.

297
00:25:44.877 --> 00:25:47.921
- How'd you know it was me?
- I'm your mother. I know everything.

298
00:25:47.963 --> 00:25:50.966
- Where have you been?
- I thought you knew everything.

299
00:25:52.676 --> 00:25:53.802
Hey, Auntie K.

300
00:25:53.844 --> 00:25:55.888
You're looking
remarkably groomed today.

301
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:57.639
Hello, Terk.

302
00:25:57.723 --> 00:26:00.267
Not the neck!
Not the neck there, T.

303
00:26:01.977 --> 00:26:04.646
Oh! Watch it! Oh! Ow! Ow!

304
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.152
Okay, it's all fun and games
till someone loses an eye.

305
00:26:10.194 --> 00:26:12.821
Please stop.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

306
00:26:12.863 --> 00:26:15.574
- It's always me.
- Cramp in the calf.

307
00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:17.993
- Please!
- Ah! Okay. Okay, you win.

308
00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:20.704
Ow! Okay, okay, you win. Hello!
Down here. Yo, yo! Let go!

309
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.501
- Oh, sorry, Terk.
- What kind of animal are you?

310
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:27.836
I been thinking lately that maybe Tarzan

311
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.838
could be some subspecies of elephant.

312
00:26:29.922 --> 00:26:32.549
What are you, crazy?
An elephant?

313
00:26:32.633 --> 00:26:36.512
Listen to me. Think about it.
He enjoys a peanut, I enjoy a peanut.

314
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.305
He looks nothing like you.

315
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.709
Ahhh!

316
00:29:26.223 --> 00:29:28.684
Okay, everybody, move aside.
Outta my way.

317
00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:31.728
Best friend coming through.
That would be me.

318
00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:33.981
And you, don't make
a habit of that, okay?

319
00:29:34.022 --> 00:29:36.483
There are other ways
of getting attention.

320
00:29:36.525 --> 00:29:38.527
- I'll try to remember that.
- All right.

321
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:40.570
I was right behind you
if you needed me.

322
00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:41.863
I had you covered.

323
00:30:19.526 --> 00:30:20.944
What was that?

324
00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:23.739
I... It wasn't me, I swear.

325
00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:26.575
- Okay, maybe it was.
- Everyone,

326
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.410
let's move.

327
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:20.003
I was reminded of
a safari I led up the Zambezi.

328
00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:23.632
Marvelous. Lots of hunting, yes.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

329
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.717
Wildebeest everywhere.

330
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:31.473
Two bearers loading three rifles
for me, blasting away.

331
00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:35.185
That's when I knew I was born for Africa

332
00:31:35.268 --> 00:31:38.313
and Africa was created for...

333
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.989
Clayton?

334
00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:50.325
Clayton... Oh, there you are.

335
00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:53.370
What is it? What is it, Clayton?
Are we in danger?

336
00:31:53.453 --> 00:31:55.163
I thought I saw something.

337
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.667
Is it a <i>Hippopotamus amphibius</i>
or a <i>Rhinoceros bicornis?</i>

338
00:31:58.708 --> 00:32:00.544
Professor, don't move!

339
00:32:00.627 --> 00:32:02.421
- Oh, right.
- Daddy?

340
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:04.714
Ow, ow, ow!

341
00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:07.384
Daddy, what's all the hullabaloo about?

342
00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.388
Ow! Ah!

343
00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:12.973
What is it, Daddy?

344
00:32:13.014 --> 00:32:16.059
Mr. Clayton asked me not to move.
He saw something.

345
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:18.937
Uh... Ooh!

346
00:32:19.229 --> 00:32:20.522
I moved.

347
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.483
Uh, Mr. Clayton? Sorry, excuse me.

348
00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:27.070
But my father and I came on this
expedition to study gorillas,

349
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:30.198
and I believe your shooting
might be scaring them off.

350
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.701
You hired me to protect you,
Miss Porter,

351
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.661
and protect you I shall.

352
00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:37.038
And you're doing a marvelous job of it.

353
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:40.876
But we only have a short time
before the ship returns, you see...

354
00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:44.379
Jane! Jane, do you realize
what you're standing in?

355
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:46.965
- A gorilla's nest!
- Daddy!

356
00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.385
At last! Our first sign in days.

357
00:32:50.469 --> 00:32:52.888
Do you think the beasts
could be nearby?

358
00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.223
Could be. Why, I mean,
there's the evidence.

359
00:32:55.265 --> 00:32:57.893
They can't be very far, anyway.

360
00:32:57.934 --> 00:32:59.728
Look! Over there and there...

361
00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:01.396
Where? Yes, more nests!

362
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.315
- I see them!
- Just as you predicted!

363
00:33:03.398 --> 00:33:04.900
Family groups!

364
00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.943
Oh, Jane, I love you.

365
00:33:08.403 --> 00:33:10.071
Family groups?

366
00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:13.116
Excuse me, but these are wild beasts

367
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.827
that would sooner tear
your head off than look at you.

368
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:17.662
On the contrary, Mr. Clayton.

369
00:33:17.746 --> 00:33:21.082
Daddy's theory is that these are
social creatures, not monsters.

370
00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:29.049
Mr. Clayton, please.
What if it's a gorilla?

371
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.134
It's no gorilla.

372
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.013
Mmm.

373
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:36.556
Perhaps we should press on.

374
00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:37.641
Yes, indeed.

375
00:33:37.724 --> 00:33:39.559
Now, we should keep heading west,

376
00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.520
following the <i>Ganoderma applanatum.</i>

377
00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:43.355
Excellent, Professor.

378
00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:46.274
I could've used your expertise
on my last safari.

379
00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:48.485
I was in the mountainous region
of Zambia.

380
00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:51.655
- Oh!
- Yes, very dangerous.

381
00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:52.948
Oh!

382
00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:56.785
Are you what all the fuss was about?

383
00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:59.788
Daddy! Daddy, quick!

384
00:33:59.829 --> 00:34:01.873
No, wait. Hold still.

385
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:03.458
Oh, my good...

386
00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:08.296
You may not be a gorilla,
but you are one sweet little...

387
00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:14.636
There you go. What do you think?

388
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:20.850
What? Oh!

389
00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:22.561
Why, you little...

390
00:34:22.644 --> 00:34:26.731
Well, this is absolutely peachy.
Come to study gorillas

391
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:30.318
and get my sketchbook
pinched by a baboon.

392
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:39.286
Give me that!

393
00:34:41.288 --> 00:34:42.747
Oh, come on now, enough of this.

394
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:44.916
I want this paper on the count of three.

395
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.459
One.

396
00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.336
Two.

397
00:34:48.378 --> 00:34:50.547
Oh, look, bananas!

398
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:54.759
I can't believe you fell for that one.

399
00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.264
No, no, don't give me
those crocodile tears.

400
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:01.308
What would your parents have to say?

401
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.522
You see, I told you they'd be cross.

402
00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:10.442
Go easy on him.
Children will be children.

403
00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:31.630
Oh, I'm flying!

404
00:35:31.713 --> 00:35:33.632
What on earth am I...

405
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.928
Get off! Get off!

406
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:46.728
Put me down! Put me down!

407
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.147
No, pick me up, pick me up!

408
00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:55.904
Help!

409
00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:57.656
Oh, no!

410
00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:18.093
Unhand me, monkey!

411
00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:40.156
Over there!

412
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:33.668
I'm in a tree with a man
who talks to monkeys.

413
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:36.337
I can't do this. I can't...

414
00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:39.090
Oh! This is good. This is very good.

415
00:37:39.174 --> 00:37:41.259
I... Oh! Wait.

416
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:43.678
One, two.

417
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:46.890
Oh...

418
00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:49.100
It can't get any worse, can it?

419
00:37:52.145 --> 00:37:54.272
Obviously it can.

420
00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:05.617
Stay back. No, don't...
Don't come any closer.

421
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.826
Please, don't.

422
00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.703
What are you... What are you doing?

423
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:12.999
No, please don't. That tickles.

424
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.959
No, get off, get off. Get off!

425
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:17.545
It serves you right.

426
00:38:17.587 --> 00:38:20.256
Stay away from me,
like a very good wild man.

427
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.592
You stay. I'm warning you.

428
00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:24.552
My father won't take kindly to you...

429
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:27.889
No. That's... Now, that's close enough.

430
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:31.226
How dare you! What...

431
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.054
Oh!

432
00:39:09.097 --> 00:39:10.098
Um...

433
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.433
Oh...

434
00:39:16.771 --> 00:39:18.106
Oh, dear.

435
00:39:18.147 --> 00:39:20.483
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear.

436
00:39:21.234 --> 00:39:22.318
Yes, thank you.

437
00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:26.281
That's a lovely heartbeat. It's very nice.

438
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:30.493
- It's very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

439
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:34.080
I can't do a thing with it
in this humidity though. It's...

440
00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.373
You do speak!

441
00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:39.544
All this time I thought you were
a big, wild, quiet, silent person thing.

442
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:40.795
Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:39:40.879 --> 00:39:43.798
I must say I'm rather curious
as to who you are. I'd love...

444
00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:47.635
Tarzan.

445
00:39:51.973 --> 00:39:53.850
Tarzan.

446
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.603
Tarzan?

447
00:39:59.939 --> 00:40:01.733
Oh, I see.

448
00:40:01.816 --> 00:40:03.860
Oh, I see.

449
00:40:03.943 --> 00:40:05.653
Tarzan.

450
00:40:05.737 --> 00:40:07.739
Oh, I see.

451
00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:11.326
No, no, no. No.

452
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:13.494
I'm Jane.

453
00:40:13.536 --> 00:40:18.082
No, no, no. No.
I'm Jane.

454
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:19.876
No, no.

455
00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:23.254
Jane. Tarzan.

456
00:40:23.338 --> 00:40:24.964
Jane.

457
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:26.925
Jane.

458
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:30.136
Exactly.

459
00:40:30.178 --> 00:40:31.471
Clayton!

460
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:36.225
Clayton.

461
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:38.895
Extraordinary.

462
00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:43.232
Please, can you take me to my camp?

463
00:40:44.567 --> 00:40:47.070
Yes, Clayton. Wonderful.

464
00:40:47.612 --> 00:40:49.697
Um...

465
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.699
Can't we walk?

466
00:40:51.783 --> 00:40:54.535
Can't we walk?

467
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:58.748
Tarzan! Tarzan! Where are you?

468
00:40:58.831 --> 00:41:01.084
Let's hope we find him
before Kerchak.

469
00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:02.335
Maybe he's lost.

470
00:41:02.377 --> 00:41:04.253
Or found something
more interesting.

471
00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:06.881
Are you nuts? What could
be more interesting than us?

472
00:41:08.174 --> 00:41:11.302
Hey, what's everybody looking at?

473
00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:18.935
The horror!

474
00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:20.979
It's gruesome. Hide me!

475
00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:23.982
Pull yourself together.
You're embarrassing me.

476
00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:26.567
These things aren't alive.

477
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:28.736
I knew that.

478
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:31.906
Tarzan!

479
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.741
Hello?

480
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:39.706
What kind of primitive beasts
are responsible for this mess?

481
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:42.417
Oh!

482
00:41:47.588 --> 00:41:50.049
Wow! Come here, you guys!
Come here, come here!

483
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:52.010
- Look at this.
- What is that thing?

484
00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:53.970
Funny. Wow.

485
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:56.264
Ooh!

486
00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:01.561
Hey!

487
00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:03.938
Do it again, do it again.

488
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.481
Like this?

489
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:07.942
- Yeah!
- Ooh.

490
00:42:09.402 --> 00:42:11.446
Yeah. Rip it!

491
00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:14.157
Ding! I love that part.

492
00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.869
Let me hear it, big fella.

493
00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:21.497
Now, hit it!

494
00:42:23.041 --> 00:42:24.042
Yeah!

495
00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:28.337
Nice.

496
00:42:30.465 --> 00:42:32.133
What the heck? Bye-bye.

497
00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:34.635
Terk.

498
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:36.387
Yeah, Tant.

499
00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:38.473
Now, hit it.

500
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:41.476
Come on, Tantor.

501
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.519
Oh, I love it.

502
00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:44.979
Stay with me, fellas.

503
00:42:45.063 --> 00:42:47.732
I feel something happening here.

We've been everywhere.

- Yes, yes.

Little baby. Little baby monkey.

533
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.455
- I drew a picture.
- Go on.

534
00:45:49.497 --> 00:45:51.666
- The monkey starts crying.
- Oh, poor baby.

535
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:54.543
But I turned round, and
there's a whole fleet of them!

536
00:45:54.627 --> 00:45:56.254
- Of what?
- An army of monkeys!

537
00:45:56.337 --> 00:45:58.297
- A huge tree full of them...
- Monkeys?

538
00:45:58.339 --> 00:45:59.966
...screaming at me!

539
00:46:00.007 --> 00:46:02.677
<i>Theropithecus baboonus.</i>
She's very good at this.

540
00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:04.387
- Oh, really?
- Terrified, I was.

541
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.848
Suddenly, I was swinging
in the vines, up in the air!

542
00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.600
- With the monkeys?
- Flying.

543
00:46:09.684 --> 00:46:11.727
- In the air.
- And I'm all surrounded.

544
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:14.272
- What did you do?
- And, Daddy, they took my boot!

545
00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:16.607
They took... Those are
the ones I bought you.

546
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:17.692
And I was saved!

547
00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:21.737
I was saved by a flying wild man
in a loincloth.

548
00:46:21.821 --> 00:46:24.490
- Loincloth, good Lord.
- What is she talking about?

549
00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:26.033
I haven't the foggiest idea.

550
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:27.910
Takes after her mother, you know.

551
00:46:27.994 --> 00:46:31.080
She'd come up with stories.
Not about men in loincloths...

552
00:46:31.163 --> 00:46:33.332
- And there were gorillas!
- Gorillas?

553
00:46:33.374 --> 00:46:37.295
- They were doing...
- You saw the gorillas? Where?

554
00:46:37.378 --> 00:46:40.381
- He left with them.
- Who, dear, who?

555
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.717
Tarzan.

556
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.218
Tarzan?

557
00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:46.053
The ape man.

558
00:46:50.016 --> 00:46:52.601
Everyone.
We will avoid the strangers.

559
00:46:52.685 --> 00:46:55.187
Do not let them see you,
and do not seek them out.

560
00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:56.939
They mean us no harm.

561
00:46:57.023 --> 00:46:58.566
Tarzan, I don't know them.

562
00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.067
I do. I've spent time with them.

563
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:02.778
You may be willing to risk
our safety, I'm not.

564
00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:05.531
Why are you threatened
by anyone different from you?

565
00:47:08.159 --> 00:47:12.872
Protect this family,
and stay away from them.

566
00:47:16.334 --> 00:47:18.669
Tarzan, for once, listen to Kerchak.

567
00:47:18.753 --> 00:47:22.214
Why didn't you tell me there
were creatures that look like me?

568
00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:33.392
Well, he didn't stand upright.
He sort of...

569
00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.852
- ...crouched.
- Really?

570
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:37.021
He supported his weight
on his knuckles.

571
00:47:37.104 --> 00:47:40.024
- On the knuckles.
- See? Exactly like a gorilla.

572
00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:42.985
- Extraordinary.
- It was amazing!

573
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:46.447
He'd bend his elbows out like this.
And then he walks, like this.

574
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.617
Oh, I see! Like Aunt Isabel.

575
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:51.494
Ba, ba, ba.

576
00:47:51.577 --> 00:47:53.162
- Capital!
- Hmm.

577
00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:55.623
Oh, Janey-Jane, what a discovery!

578
00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:57.958
A man with no language,
no human behavior...

579
00:47:58.042 --> 00:48:00.461
And no respect
for personal boundaries.

580
00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:02.880
- How do you mean?
- He was this close, Daddy.

581
00:48:02.963 --> 00:48:04.173
Staring at me.

582
00:48:04.256 --> 00:48:07.551
He seemed confused at first,

583
00:48:07.635 --> 00:48:10.179
as if he's never seen
another human before.

584
00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:15.476
And his eyes were intense
and focused, and...

585
00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:19.688
I've never seen such eyes.

586
00:48:21.857 --> 00:48:26.237
Oh, shall I leave you and the
blackboard alone for a moment?

587
00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.198
Daddy, stop it. The point is,

588
00:48:29.281 --> 00:48:32.410
think of what we could learn
from him. We must find him.

589
00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:33.744
Oh!

590
00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:37.623
Professor, you are here to find gorillas,

591
00:48:37.665 --> 00:48:40.251
not indulge some girlish fantasy.

592
00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:43.045
Fantasy? I didn't imagine him.

593
00:48:43.129 --> 00:48:44.338
Tarzan is...

594
00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:47.091
Real.

595
00:48:47.174 --> 00:48:49.677
Ah! It's him!

596
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.512
It's him, it's him. Tarzan!

597
00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:53.514
- Professor, Jane, stand back!
- Wait!

598
00:48:53.556 --> 00:48:55.516
No!

599
00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:57.184
Clayton.

600
00:48:58.269 --> 00:48:59.395
Huh?

601
00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:01.564
- Clayton.
- Ah!

602
00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:03.983
Have we met?

603
00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:06.777
How does he know my name?

604
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:09.363
He thinks it means
the sound of a gunshot.

605
00:49:09.447 --> 00:49:13.576
- Jane.
- Yes. Hello, Tarzan.

606
00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:15.870
I see what you mean about boundaries.

607
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:18.581
What's he doing?

608
00:49:19.582 --> 00:49:21.459
Look at him, Jane.

609
00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:23.586
Moves like an ape, but looks like a man.

610
00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:26.630
He could be the missing link.

611
00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:29.925
Or our link to the gorillas.

612
00:49:30.009 --> 00:49:31.760
Ah! Yes, yes.

613
00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:35.973
Where are the gorillas?

614
00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:39.226
Go-ri-llas!

615
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.228
Go-ri-llas!

616
00:49:41.312 --> 00:49:43.147
Shouting won't help, Mr. Clayton.

617
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:44.899
He doesn't understand English.

618
00:49:44.982 --> 00:49:46.901
Then I'll make him understand.

619
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:49.737
If I can teach a parrot
to sing <i>God Save the Queen,</i>

620
00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:53.741
I can certainly teach
this savage a thing or two.

621
00:49:54.742 --> 00:49:56.785
Gorilla.

622
00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.830
Gorilla.

623
00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:02.458
- He's got it!
- Gorilla.

624
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:05.503
- Go-ri-lla.
- Perhaps not.

625
00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:08.756
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, no, no!

626
00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:11.383
Gimme that. Leave it.

627
00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.637
Mr. Clayton, I think I'll take it from here.

628
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:27.942
<i>Whatever you do
I'll do it too</i>

629
00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:32.196
<i>Show me everything and tell me how</i>

630
00:50:32.279 --> 00:50:34.448
<i>It all means something</i>

631
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.952
<i>And yet nothing to me</i>

632
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:43.958
<i>I can see there's so much to learn</i>

633
00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:48.212
<i>It's all so close and yet so far</i>

634
00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:52.174
<i>I see myself as people see me</i>

635
00:50:52.258 --> 00:50:56.220
<i>Oh, I just know there's
Something bigger out there</i>

636
00:50:56.303 --> 00:51:00.224
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me?</i>

637
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:04.228
<i>I wanna know about
These strangers like me</i>

638
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:08.190
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

639
00:51:08.274 --> 00:51:12.278
<i>Something's familiar
About these strangers like me</i>

640
00:51:20.452 --> 00:51:24.540
<i>Every gesture
Every move that she makes</i>

641
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:28.335
<i>Makes me feel like never before</i>

642
00:51:28.377 --> 00:51:34.133
<i>Why do I have this
Growing need to be beside her?</i>

643
00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:39.680
<i>These emotions I never knew</i>

644
00:51:39.722 --> 00:51:44.184
<i>Of some other world
Far beyond this place</i>

645
00:51:44.226 --> 00:51:47.855
<i>Beyond the trees
Above the clouds</i>

646
00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:52.359
<i>I see before me a new horizon</i>

647
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:56.196
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me?</i>

648
00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.367
<i>I wanna know about
These strangers like me</i>

649
00:52:00.451 --> 00:52:04.038
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

650
00:52:04.121 --> 00:52:08.292
<i>Something's familiar
About these strangers like me</i>

651
00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:13.380
<i>Come with me now to see my world</i>

652
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:17.468
<i>Where there's beauty
Beyond your dreams</i>

653
00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:21.555
<i>Can you feel the things I feel?</i>

654
00:52:21.597 --> 00:52:25.809
<i>Right now, with you</i>

655
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:29.730
<i>Take my hand</i>

656
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:34.234
<i>There's a world I need to know</i>

657
00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:54.254
We've wasted all
this time on what he wants.

658
00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:58.342
The boat could arrive any day.
Now, ask him straight out.

659
00:53:01.428 --> 00:53:05.265
Tarzan, will you take us to the gorillas?

660
00:53:06.058 --> 00:53:07.434
Do you understand?

661
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:09.645
I understand.

662
00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:11.689
- Good work, Jane.
- Well?

663
00:53:12.439 --> 00:53:14.149
- I can't.
- What?

664
00:53:14.233 --> 00:53:17.444
- Why not, Tarzan?
- Kerchak.

665
00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:24.618
<i>I wanna know
Can you show me?</i>

666
00:53:24.702 --> 00:53:28.539
<i>I wanna know about
These strangers like me</i>

667
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:32.376
<i>Tell me more
Please show me</i>

668
00:53:32.459 --> 00:53:37.548
<i>Something's familiar
About these strangers like me</i>

669
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.717
<i>I wanna know</i>

670
00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.280
Oh, Terk, I've never seen him so happy.

671
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.323
Yeah? I give it a week.

672
00:54:06.952 --> 00:54:08.787
- Aye, cut her loose!
- Come on, pull it down.

673
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.166
All right, move it, ya bilge rats!

674
00:54:12.249 --> 00:54:13.417
Heave ho, lads.

675
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.086
Put your back in it.
All right, move it.

676
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:19.006
Please, don't...
I've waited 30 years for this

677
00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:21.508
and I won't leave until I see a gorilla.

678
00:54:21.550 --> 00:54:25.846
Oh! Isn't this dreadful, Tarzan?
No! No, no, wait!

679
00:54:25.888 --> 00:54:28.098
Pick your barrel up. Pick it up.

680
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:30.184
Here we go. Here we go.

681
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:33.729
You're the captain.
Tell them you've had engine trouble

682
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.314
and give us two more days.

683
00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:37.775
And be late at every port
from here to London?

684
00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:39.401
We'll have come for nothing.

685
00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:43.197
I'm sorry, Miss Porter,
but I simply can't do it.

686
00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.866
This is your fault.

687
00:54:45.908 --> 00:54:49.369
I should've followed my instincts
and set traps for the beasts.

688
00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:52.206
Don't you think I'm disappointed
about the gorillas?

689
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.708
You are absolutely impossible!

690
00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:58.629
Tarzan. I was so afraid that
you wouldn't come in time.

691
00:54:58.712 --> 00:55:00.005
The boat's arrived.

692
00:55:00.047 --> 00:55:03.133
The boat that's come
to take us home, to England.

693
00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:07.679
And Daddy and I were...
Well, I was wondering...

694
00:55:07.721 --> 00:55:10.808
Well, we really hope
that you'll come with us.

695
00:55:10.891 --> 00:55:12.309
Won't you?

696
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.647
Go see England today.
Come home tomorrow.

697
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.690
Oh. No.

698
00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:22.027
Well, see, it would be very
difficult to come back...

699
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:23.320
Ever.

700
00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:24.947
Not come back?

701
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.034
I know it sounds awful, but
you belong with us, with people.

702
00:55:29.076 --> 00:55:31.078
Jane must stay with Tarzan.

703
00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:34.414
Stay here? Oh, no, no, no... My laundry.

704
00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:37.918
No, I can't stay. Look, I've got...

705
00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.420
I'm with my father, and...

706
00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:44.216
Jane... Stay.

707
00:55:44.258 --> 00:55:46.593
- But...
- Please.

708
00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.515
But, I can't.

709
00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.936
Women.

710
00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:58.772
How typical. Thank you, Jones.

711
00:55:58.856 --> 00:56:02.901
Even if you hadn't grown up
a savage, you'd be lost.

712
00:56:02.943 --> 00:56:06.446
There are no trails
through a woman's heart.

713
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:10.117
- Jane is going.
- Yes.

714
00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:14.288
If only she could've spent
more time with the gorillas.

715
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:16.623
She's so disappointed.

716
00:56:16.707 --> 00:56:19.501
Crushed, really.

717
00:56:19.585 --> 00:56:22.588
Sorry, old boy.

718
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:26.049
Oh, well, I'd best get
Jane's things to the ship.

719
00:56:30.262 --> 00:56:31.305
Clayton.

720
00:56:33.974 --> 00:56:37.269
If Jane sees gorillas, she stays?

721
00:56:37.311 --> 00:56:41.023
Say, that's why she came, isn't it?

722
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:45.819
- I'll do it.
- Good man!

723
00:56:45.903 --> 00:56:47.446
- Snipes?
- Sir?

724
00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:52.159
Get the boys together. There's
gonna be a change in plans.

725
00:56:52.492 --> 00:56:54.286
Terk, just get Kerchak out of the way.

726
00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.330
- What?
- Oh, I'd be happy to get...

727
00:56:56.371 --> 00:57:00.000
Hey! Shut your trunk
and get me out of here.

728
00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:02.336
Can you believe that guy?

729
00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:05.839
Drops us like a newborn giraffe,
kerplop!

730
00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:09.384
Now waltzes in here
and expects us to just...

731
00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:12.054
Terk, I'm asking you as a friend.

732
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:17.601
With the face and the eyes and the...

733
00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:22.189
Oh! All right! But don't make me
do anything embarrassing.

734
00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:24.942
I'm gonna kill him!

735
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:28.278
I thought that dress
was rather slimming on you.

736
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:31.281
Oh, really? I thought it was
a little revealing and kind of...

737
00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:36.703
How does she move in this thing?

738
00:57:40.165 --> 00:57:42.167
Look out!

739
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:10.696
- Look, Daddy!
- Where?

740
00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.489
Jane.

741
00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:16.076
Now, be careful, Professor.

742
00:58:16.118 --> 00:58:18.078
Mustn't, mustn't frighten.

743
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.497
She's beautiful.

744
00:58:21.415 --> 00:58:23.583
She's my mother.

745
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:27.004
But... This is your...

746
00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:30.007
Mother?

747
00:58:39.558 --> 00:58:42.728
- What's happening?
- I don't know, Daddy.

748
00:58:43.437 --> 00:58:44.896
Oh! It's getting away!

749
00:58:44.938 --> 00:58:47.524
No! You'll only frighten her more.

750
00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:58.952
Yes, absolutely, my dear. Good idea.

751
00:58:58.994 --> 00:59:01.163
What are you doing?
Want to frighten them?

752
00:59:01.246 --> 00:59:03.373
Get up. Get...

753
00:59:03.457 --> 00:59:05.709
Don't get up.

754
00:59:26.563 --> 00:59:28.190
Oh!

755
00:59:36.823 --> 00:59:38.075
Hello.

756
00:59:41.953 --> 00:59:42.996
Ooh!

757
00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:45.582
It's very nice to meet you, too.

758
00:59:49.503 --> 00:59:52.964
Oh, your Majesty, you're such a tease.

759
00:59:53.006 --> 00:59:54.049
Whoa!

760
00:59:54.132 --> 00:59:55.842
Hello. Hello.

761
00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:58.970
Archimedes Q. Porter at your service.
Ah!

762
00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.598
Quite a grip you've got.

763
01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.851
Oh, thank you, yes. Is that one of mine?

764
01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.355
Oh, this is wonderful, Mr. Clayton!

765
01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.107
Look, look! Social grooming.

766
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:13.360
Congratulations, Professor.

767
01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.696
Our dream has come true.

768
01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.910
Give me that!

769
01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.412
Hey, what are you doing?
Now, stop that! Stop!

770
01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:26.123
Hold on now. Leave that!

771
01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:28.375
That is not to be played with!

772
01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.558
Can you teach me?

773
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:47.894
- Speak gorilla?
- Hmm. Yes.

774
01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.836
Good heavens, what did I say?

775
01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:16.089
That Jane stays with Tarzan.

776
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:19.593
Stay? But I... I thought we'd already...

777
01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.304
- Tarzan, I...
- Whoa!

778
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.270
- Is that my dress?
- Oh, no.

779
01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.275
Daddy.

780
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.572
Give it to me!

781
01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.365
Huh?

782
01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:44.826
Go!

783
01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.429
Go!

784
01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.974
Wait, wait! Tarzan!

785
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.226
Go now!

786
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:12.562
Jane, quickly! Hurry! Come along!

787
01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.335
Kerchak, I didn't... I'm sorry, I...

788
01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:38.838
I asked you to protect our family.

789
01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.509
And you betrayed us all.

790
01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:13.164
I'm so confused.

791
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.294
Come with me.

792
01:03:17.377 --> 01:03:20.547
There's something I should've
shown you long ago.

793
01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.170
Is this me?

794
01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:48.468
And this is my father,

795
01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.220
and...

796
01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.930
And my...

797
01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:55.725
Now you know.

798
01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:59.979
Tarzan, I just want you to be happy,

799
01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.774
whatever you decide.

800
01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:54.534
No matter where I go,
you will always be my mother.

801
01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:02.208
And you will always be in my heart.

802
01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.481
Goodbye, Tarzan.

803
01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.524
Tarzan!

804
01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.860
I'm so glad you found us in time.

805
01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.996
Tarzan!

806
01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:43.082
We're too late! I can't believe it!

807
01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:45.919
If you had pulled over
and asked for directions...

808
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:48.087
We didn't get to say goodbye.

809
01:06:48.129 --> 01:06:51.216
Well, good riddance, all right?
Who needs you, huh?

810
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.301
Go on, get out of here, bald boy!

811
01:06:53.384 --> 01:06:56.262
You ingrate! You bald ingrate!

812
01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:58.306
Go on and rot, for all I care!

813
01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:00.099
Go!

814
01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:04.145
What are you looking at?

815
01:07:04.229 --> 01:07:06.105
I'm gonna miss him, too.

816
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:17.492
Oh, Tarzan, you can't imagine
what's in store for you.

817
01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:20.620
You'll see the world.
Everyone's going to want to meet you.

818
01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.914
Kings, scientists, famous writers.

819
01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:26.292
Yes. Darwin and Kipling.
Queen Victoria!

820
01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.628
I haven't met her, but I heard she's nice.

821
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.338
And I'll be with Jane?

822
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.468
Yes, with Jane.

823
01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:38.972
Oh! Slippery.

824
01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.660
Tarzan!

825
01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.996
- Ow!
- Tarzan!

826
01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.038
Get him!

827
01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:11.796
- Tarzan!
- Jane!

828
01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.861
What's going on here?

829
01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:37.155
Clayton! Clayton, help!

830
01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.950
Have we met?

831
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:48.124
Ah, yes, the ape man.

832
01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.294
Clayton, you...

833
01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:52.420
You...

834
01:08:54.088 --> 01:08:56.633
So sorry about the rude welcome,
old boy,

835
01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:58.718
but I couldn't have you making a scene

836
01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:02.930
when we put your furry friends
in their cages.

837
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.515
Why?

838
01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.225
Why?

839
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:09.062
For 300 pounds sterling a head.

840
01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.607
Actually, I have you to thank, my boy.

841
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:15.735
Couldn't have done it without you.

842
01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.989
Lock him up with the others.

843
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:23.159
No!

844
01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.496
That sounded like Tarzan.

845
01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:28.915
He sounded like he was in trouble.

846
01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:31.042
Yeah, why doesn't
he get his new friends

847
01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.543
to help him? I don't care.

848
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.797
That's it!

849
01:09:35.963 --> 01:09:39.092
I've had it with you
and your emotional constipation!

850
01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:42.053
Tarzan needs us
and we're gonna help him!

851
01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:46.182
You got that? Now, pipe down
and hang on tight!

852
01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.434
We've got a boat to catch.

853
01:09:57.110 --> 01:10:00.697
I've never felt so alive!

854
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.491
Good! 'Cause I'm gonna kill you!

855
01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.785
No time for that now, missy.

856
01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.224
Tarzan, it's no use. Don't!

857
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.652
- Clayton.
- Yes, Clayton.

858
01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:43.990
Clayton betrayed us all.
I'm so sorry, Tarzan.

859
01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:46.784
No, I did this.

860
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.162
I betrayed my family.

861
01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.205
Kerchak was right.

862
01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:56.252
Oh, those magnificent creatures,
shivering in cages.

863
01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:59.088
What is this world coming to?

864
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.177
Oh!

865
01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:07.597
Oh, by Jove!
Don't know my own strength.

866
01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.103
What was that?

867
01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:17.023
You are an animal!

868
01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.568
That sounded just like an elephant.

869
01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:21.861
Tantor!

870
01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:24.697
Thanks, guys.

871
01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:27.658
I thought I would never see you again!

872
01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.036
And here you are.

873
01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.372
Sometimes you embarrass me.

874
01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:43.776
Ah! I remember you.

875
01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.989
I think this one will be better off stuffed.

876
01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.804
You came back.

877
01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.389
I came home.

878
01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.197
Fire!

879
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.664
You there! Take what you can
back to the boat.

880
01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:40.041
Aye, aye, sir.

881
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.921
I've got some hunting to do.

882
01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:10.446
Don't worry.

883
01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:12.907
I'm going to have you
out of this in a second.

884
01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.164
This should do the trick.

885
01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.850
No!

886
01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.647
Hiding, are we?

887
01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.108
- Good!
- Clayton, you...

888
01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:50.569
I could use a challenge.
Because after I get rid of you,

889
01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:55.700
rounding up your little ape
family will be all too easy!

890
01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:24.311
Go ahead, shoot me.

891
01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.734
Be a man.

892
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.326
Not a man like you!

893
01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.403
Clayton, don't!

894
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.249
Tarzan.

895
01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:11.460
Kerchak, forgive me.

896
01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:14.505
No.

897
01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:18.217
Forgive me for not understanding

898
01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:22.263
that you have always been one of us.

899
01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:27.309
Our family will look to you now.

900
01:17:29.436 --> 01:17:31.272
No, Kerchak.

901
01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.107
Take care of them...

902
01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:36.777
My son.

903
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.663
Take care of them.

904
01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:12.539
London will seem so small
compared to all this.

905
01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.416
I will miss you, Jane.

906
01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:19.129
- Miss Porter!
- I know. I'm coming.

907
01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:24.843
Well... I suppose we
should say goodbye.

908
01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:38.399
Goodbye.

909
01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.537
Goodbye, Tarzan! Goodbye.

910
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:54.206
Oh, I'm going to miss that boy.

911
01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.720
Jane, dear, I can't help feeling
that you should stay.

912
01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:10.222
Please don't.
We've been through all of this.

913
01:20:10.306 --> 01:20:12.349
I couldn't possibly...

914
01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:16.895
I belong in England with you,
with people...

915
01:20:22.693 --> 01:20:24.403
But you love him.

916
01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.035
Go on.

917
01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.134
Oh!

918
01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:56.352
Uh...

919
01:20:56.769 --> 01:21:00.272
Thank you.
Thanks for getting my glove.

920
01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:02.483
Thank you.

921
01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:21.335
What am I doing?

922
01:21:21.418 --> 01:21:24.671
Captain, tell them
that you never found us, eh?

923
01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:28.384
After all, people get lost
in the jungle every day.

924
01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:29.718
Toodle-pip.

925
01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:54.159
<i>Put your faith in
What you most believe in</i>

926
01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:57.871
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

927
01:21:57.955 --> 01:22:01.667
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

928
01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:03.877
<i>To guide these lives</i>

929
01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:07.381
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

930
01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:14.888
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

931
01:22:31.321 --> 01:22:35.033
<i>Come stop your crying
It will be all right</i>

932
01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:40.581
<i>Just take my hand
Hold it tight</i>

933
01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:45.544
<i>I will protect you
from all around you</i>

934
01:22:46.086 --> 01:22:49.631
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

935
01:22:50.883 --> 01:22:55.220
<i>For one so small
You seem so strong</i>

936
01:22:56.054 --> 01:23:00.017
<i>My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm</i>

937
01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:05.439
<i>This bond between us
can't be broken</i>

938
01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:09.276
<i>I will be here
Don't you cry</i>

939
01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:13.947
<i>'Cause you'll be
in my heart</i>

940
01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:18.911
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

941
01:23:20.329 --> 01:23:22.789
<i>From this day on</i>

942
01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:26.585
<i>Now and forever more</i>

943
01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:34.092
<i>You'll be in my heart</i>

944
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:39.014
<i>No matter what they say</i>

945
01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:43.936
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

946
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:46.730
<i>Always</i>

947
01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:57.115
<i>Why can't they understand
the way we feel</i>

948
01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:02.037
<i>They just don't trust
what they can't explain</i>

949
01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:07.501
<i>Well, I know we're different
But deep inside us</i>

950
01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:10.837
<i>We're not that different at all</i>

951
01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:16.134
<i>And you'll be in my heart</i>

952
01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:21.181
<i>Yes, you'll be in my heart</i>

953
01:24:22.474 --> 01:24:24.434
<i>From this day on</i>

954
01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:28.480
<i>Now and forever more</i>

955
01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:36.822
<i>Don't listen to them
'cause what do they know</i>

956
01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:41.868
<i>We need each other
to have, to hold</i>

957
01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:44.746
<i>They'll see in time</i>

958
01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.834
<i>I know</i>

959
01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:56.508
<i>When destiny calls you
You must be strong</i>

960
01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:01.805
<i>I may not be with you
but you got to hold on</i>

961
01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.725
<i>They'll see in time</i>

962
01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:08.604
<i>I know</i>

963
01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:12.024
<i>We'll show them together</i>

964
01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:15.819
<i>'Cause you'll be
in my heart</i>

965
01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:20.741
<i>Believe me
You'll be in my heart</i>

966
01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:24.244
<i>I'll be there
from this day on</i>

967
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.040
<i>Now and forever more</i>

968
01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:35.380
<i>Oh, you'll be in my heart</i>

969
01:25:35.422 --> 01:25:37.257
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

970
01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:40.510
<i>No matter what they say</i>

971
01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:42.346
<i>I'll be with you</i>

972
01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:45.557
<i>You'll be here in my heart</i>

973
01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:48.852
<i>I'll be there always</i>

974
01:25:51.730 --> 01:25:54.608
<i>Always</i>

975
01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.278
<i>I'll be with you</i>

976
01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:04.326
<i>Well, I'll be there
for you always</i>

977
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.580
<i>Always and always</i>

978
01:26:11.291 --> 01:26:14.169
<i>Just look over your shoulder</i>

979
01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:19.257
<i>Just look over your shoulder</i>

980
01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:24.054
<i>Just look over your shoulder</i>

981
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.809
<i>I'll be there always</i>

982
01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:42.614
<i>Put your faith
in what you most believe in</i>

983
01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.493
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

984
01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:51.081
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

985
01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:54.292
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>

986
01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:59.631
<i>A paradise untouched by man</i>

987
01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:03.927
<i>Within this world
blessed with love</i>

988
01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:09.224
<i>A simple life
They live in peace</i>

989
01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:13.186
<i>Raise your head up
Lift high the load</i>

990
01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:16.648
<i>Take strength
from those that need you</i>

991
01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:21.737
<i>Build high the walls
Build strong the beams</i>

992
01:27:21.987 --> 01:27:24.156
<i>A new life is waiting</i>

993
01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.492
<i>But danger's
no stranger here</i>

994
01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:43.133
<i>No words describe
a mother's tears</i>

995
01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:47.345
<i>No words can heal
a broken heart</i>

996
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.183
<i>A dream is gone</i>

997
01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:53.268
<i>But where there's hope</i>

998
01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.688
<i>Somewhere
Something is calling for you</i>

999
01:27:57.647 --> 01:28:00.817
<i>Two worlds, one family</i>

1000
01:28:01.401 --> 01:28:05.197
<i>Trust your heart
Let fate decide</i>

1001
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.575
<i>To guide these lives we see</i>
