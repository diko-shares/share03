00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:21.355
<i>Now, where to begin?</i>

2
00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.942
<i>How 'bout, "Once upon a time“?</i>

3
00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.739
<i>How many times have you heard
that to begin a story?</i>

4
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.450
<i>Let's do somethin' else.
I got it, I got it,</i>

5
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.410
<i>here we go.
Here's how to open a movie!</i>

6
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.041
<i>No, I don't think so.
It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?</i>

7
00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.085
<i>Oh, no, no, not the book.</i>

8
00:00:43.127 --> 00:00:45.463
<i>How many have seen
"opening the book" before?</i>

9
00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:48.466
<i>Close the book. We 're not doing that.</i>

10
00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.967
<i>Here's what we're gonna do.</i>

11
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.470
<i>Why don't I just go back to the day</i>

12
00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:55.556
<i>things took a turn for the worse?</i>

13
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.148
Run for your lives!
Everyone run for cover!

14
00:01:04.232 --> 00:01:07.151
SOS! Mayday! Mayday!

15
00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.946
Code red! Duck and cover!

16
00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:11.364
You're all in danger!

17
00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:14.700
Ah!

18
00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:20.248
Run for cover!

19
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.710
Run for your lives!

20
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.881
Emergency! Emergency!

21
00:01:41.978 --> 00:01:43.312
Whoa!

22
00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.901
- Whoa!
- Aaah!

23
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:58.369
Look out! Take cover!

24
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.015
Run for cover!

25
00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:23.519
Chicken Little!
What is it? What's going on?

26
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:26.314
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!

27
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:29.567
- The sky is falling?
- Are you crazy?

28
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.569
No, no, no!
It's true! Come with me!

29
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.156
No. Son? What?

30
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.408
It happened under the old oak tree!

31
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.243
I'm not making this up. It's here.

32
00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:42.121
There's a piece
of the sky somewhere...

33
00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:43.664
...somewhere on the ground.

34
00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.916
It was shaped like that!

35
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.085
- It looks like a stop sign?
- Yes!

36
00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:52.006
Only it doesn't say "stop"
and it's blue and it has a cloud on it.

37
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.091
And it hit me on the head!

38
00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:56.719
- It looked like a stop sign.
- Wait! What's that?

39
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.763
- Son, is this what hit you?
- What?

40
00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:01.474
Oh, no, Dad. It was
definitely a piece of the sky!

41
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:03.684
Piece of the sky. It's OK, everyone!

42
00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:06.687
- Dad, no.
- There's been, like, a little mistake.

43
00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:10.358
It was just an acorn that-that
hit my son. A little acorn.

44
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.901
- No! Dad, no.
- Quiet, son.

45
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.111
This is embarrassing enough already.

46
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.322
Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'?

47
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:18.449
Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?

48
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:20.785
How could you mistake
a stop sign for an acorn?

49
00:03:20.868 --> 00:03:24.705
- But it... a big acorn level fluh.
- What did he say?

50
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.958
- A big acorn level fluh...
- It was a big acorn?

51
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.088
- An ape throwing coleslaw?
- A big acorn level fluh...

52
00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.589
Gesundheit!

53
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:36.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just gibberish,

54
00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:39.136
- gibberish of an insane person.
- Come on, Buck!

55
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.639
Your kid went
and scared us all half to death!

56
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.809
Well, what can I tell you,
folks, my son,

57
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:48.979
you know... Kids do crazy stuff.
You have kids. It's...

58
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:52.483
No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn.

59
00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.653
It was... it was a piece of the sky.
Really, it was.

60
00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.781
You gotta believe me.

61
00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.713
A movie. A movie.

62
00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:16.424
They're makin' a movie.

63
00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:20.344
When? When will everybody
forget your big mistake?

64
00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:23.889
First it was all over the papers,
then they wrote a book about it,

65
00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:26.517
then the book on tape,
then the board game,

66
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.854
the spoons with your face on it...

67
00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:32.857
...and the Web site,
the commemorative plates.

68
00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:34.942
- You saw them, right?
- Yeah. I saw them.

69
00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:36.402
Can't eat off 'em.

70
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:39.321
- They're not microwave-safe.
- You saw the billboards?

71
00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:40.865
I saw them.

72
00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.705
Ha! There's a bumper sticker.
I knew it was only a matter of time.

73
00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:51.167
Billboards I could live with.
Posters I could even live with.

74
00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:56.630
But a bumper sticker.
It's... it's like glued on forever.

75
00:04:56.714 --> 00:04:59.884
It doesn't matter. You know why?
Because I've got a plan.

76
00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:03.095
Yeah, about that.
Well, remember how I told you

77
00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.222
it would be better for you to lay low,

78
00:05:05.306 --> 00:05:07.224
don't call attention to yourself?

79
00:05:07.308 --> 00:05:09.393
- Yes, but I...
- See, it's like a game.

80
00:05:09.477 --> 00:05:11.061
Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek,

81
00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:14.607
except the goal
is never to be found, ever!

82
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.150
Great!

83
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.569
Now, we've got a plan, right?

84
00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:25.868
I'll see ya later! Remember, lay low.

85
00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:28.621
Yeah. OK.

86
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.251
Bye.

87
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:38.172
Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!

88
00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:42.009
Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so
smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!

89

- Yeah, unpopular?

Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:04.748
- Your old foe!
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:11:04.832 --> 00:11:07.501
- Incoming on your right.
- Thank you!

176
00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:15.634
Aah!

177
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:21.932
Yeah, I heard about
the movie. Tough break.

178
00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:24.560
- Yeah.
- Maybe it'll just go straight to video.

179
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:26.603
That's the least of my problems.

180
00:11:26.687 --> 00:11:30.524
This morning... this morning my dad
told me I should basically disappear.

181
00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.276
But that's not gonna get me down.

182
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.403
I've got a plan.
You want to hear about it?

183
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.363
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, no! This one's good.

184
00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:39.408
Look, one moment destroyed
my life, right? One moment.

185
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.076
- Warthog at 3:00!
- I see him!

186
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.706
- Yes!
- So I figure all I need is a chance...

187
00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:48.542
All I need is a chance
to do something great

188
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:51.962
to make everyone forget the
"sky falling" thing once and for all.

189
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.923
And then my dad'll finally
have a reason to be proud of me.

190
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:56.341
Time out!

191
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:01.305
Nurse!

192
00:12:04.182 --> 00:12:06.852
- Hi, Tiffany!
- Hey, man, what's goin' on?

193
00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.104
So, what do you think?

194
00:12:09.146 --> 00:12:10.898
OK, listen.

195
00:12:10.981 --> 00:12:12.816
You said the sky was falling.

196
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.152
- Your dad didn't support you.
- I...

197
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:19.156
And you have been hurting
inside ever since, right?

198
00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.783
- It's hurt. It stung. OK?
- It's hurt, but... Yes.

199
00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.869
- That's the nutshell.
- OK. Yes, but...

200
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:25.704
- No. Buh-buh...
- But, it's...

201
00:12:25.787 --> 00:12:29.917
What's got to happen now
is the nut needs to be cracked open.

202
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.669
And not one little chip
at a time, but... bam!

203
00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:36.340
Smash! Bits of emotion flying
everywhere! Anger! Frustration!

204
00:12:36.423 --> 00:12:39.676
Denial! Fear!
Deep depression, in fact!

205
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.178
You see what I'm saying?

206
00:12:42.554 --> 00:12:43.805
Uh...

207
00:12:43.847 --> 00:12:46.892
All right, forget the nut part.
Here's the main thing.

208
00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:50.771
You have got to stop messing around,
and deal with the problem.

209
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:53.106
- OK, yes, but...
- Here's the real solution.

210
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.692
You and your dad
talk-talk-talking... closure!

211
00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:56.902
- Closure?
- Closure,

212
00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.446
talking about something
until it's resolved.

213
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:01.865
Wait! Hold on! See? Look.

214
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:05.327
There's a whole section about it
in this month's <i>Modern Mallard.</i>

215
00:13:05.369 --> 00:13:08.705
- Incredibly appropriate!
- I told you, I have a plan.

216
00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:10.707
Yeah, but according to <i>Cosmo Duck,</i>

217
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:13.543
you should
"stop the squawk and try the talk."

218
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:15.170
<i>Beautiful Duckling</i> says,

219
00:13:15.212 --> 00:13:18.590
"Avoiding closure with your parents
can cause early molting."

220
00:13:18.674 --> 00:13:20.968
See? Closure.

221
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.720
Repeat after me.
You, your dad, talk-talk...

222
00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:26.848
Abby, listen! Talking's a waste of time.

223
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.435
I got to do something great so my dad
doesn't think I'm such a loser.

224
00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:32.562
Come on. You are not a loser.

225
00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:36.483
You're inventive and resourceful
and funny and cute and...

226
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.943
What?

227
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:42.447
Yeah... uh, Runt!

228
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:46.034
Should Chicken Little have a good talk
with his dad and clear the air

229
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.913
or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions
and never deal with the problem?

230
00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:51.957
Band-Aid solutions!

231
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.917
- Runt!
- Well, I'm sorry!

232
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.003
I'm very bad at reading facial cues.

233
00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:57.754
Fish, help me out here.

234
00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.438
Men.

235
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.440
'Twas beauty that killed the beast.

236
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:21.278
I guess only girls are good at
honest communication and sensitivity.

237
00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:26.408
That does it!
We were in a time-out, Foxy!

238
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.786
Prepare to hurt.
And I don't mean emotionally, like I do.

239
00:14:32.956 --> 00:14:34.207
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

240
00:14:36.126 --> 00:14:38.503
Whoa!

241
00:14:45.385 --> 00:14:47.262
We will save you!

242
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.973
Fall back! Mad goose!

243
00:15:06.323 --> 00:15:08.575
Chicken Little!

244
00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:12.245
Not showing up for class,
inappropriate school attire,

245
00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:15.082
picking fights in gym class
and the fire alarm?

246
00:15:15.165 --> 00:15:19.503
Ever since that "sky falling" incident,
he's been nothing but trouble!

247
00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:23.340
Now look, Buck.

248
00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.134
You know I have
the utmost respect for you.

249
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:28.678
I mean, you were Buck "Ace" Cluck,

250
00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:32.224
our school baseball star.

251
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.646
But let's face the facts.

252
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.775
Your kid, he's nothing like you at all.

253
00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:43.985
OK.

254
00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:48.198
Thank you for talking to me.
I'll take care of my son.

255
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.578
I... Dad, it wasn't my fault.

256
00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:56.498
- It was Foxy. She's always...
- All right. It's fine.

257
00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.376
You don't have to explain anything.

258
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.185
Uh...

259
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:21.648
Uh... Hey, Dad?

260
00:16:21.731 --> 00:16:26.695
I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I...?

261
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.488
What if...?

262
00:16:28.572 --> 00:16:30.907
What if I joined the baseball team?

263
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:33.660
Hey, why don't you
watch where you're going?!

264
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.787
Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry.

265
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:39.583
Baseball? Son, we talked about this.

266
00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:42.377
Yeah, right. But, you know,
that was when I was small.

267
00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:46.089
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.

268
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:48.800
Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure?

269
00:16:48.884 --> 00:16:51.803
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean,
you know, hey, why not, right?

270
00:16:51.887 --> 00:16:53.930
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad,

271
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:56.558
you were such a big
baseball star in high school.

272
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.268
You could give me some pointers.

273
00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:00.729
But, son, you know,
I'm just wondering...

274
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.983
Maybe baseball isn't exactly
your thing, you know?

275
00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:08.695
Have you considered
the chess team or the glee club?

276
00:17:08.778 --> 00:17:12.657
And some teenagers, you know, they
get quite a rush from stamp collecting.

277
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:14.784
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'll get some stamps.

278
00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:17.537
- I don't like stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...

279
00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.080
No, I was thinkin' baseball!

280
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:21.124
I can't wait to see
the look on your face

281
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:23.376
when I smack that ball in
for a touchdown!

282
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:29.132
Dad... Um, I'm kidding.

283
00:17:29.216 --> 00:17:30.967
That was a... that was a joke.

284
00:17:33.178 --> 00:17:35.555
Just do me one favor, son.

285
00:17:35.639 --> 00:17:37.849
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.

286
00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:42.103
Just please try not
to get your hopes too high.

287
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.980
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...

288
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.983
I mean, I think I can...

289
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.448
I...

290
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.078

<i>C'mon Acorns
Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!</i>

349
00:21:58.193 --> 00:22:01.613
There's excitement
in the air, ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:22:01.696 --> 00:22:04.574
It's been two decades since
Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals

351
00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.409
the Spud Valley Taters.

352
00:22:06.493 --> 00:22:09.787
Down by only a single run,
and with a player in scoring position,

353
00:22:09.871 --> 00:22:11.915
we finally have a chance again.

354
00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:15.793
This excitement isn't about the fun
of baseball, it's not about the prize.

355
00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:18.463
It's about gloating
and rubbing their noses in it,

356
00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:21.633
the "Nah-nah-na-na-na!
We beat you!" taunting, if you will,

357
00:22:21.716 --> 00:22:24.385
- that comes with the winning.
- Yeah!

358
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:29.849
That's right. Oakey Oaks
and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey

359
00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:33.686
will finally have bragging rights
again for one full year!

360
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:41.945
But this battle has taken
a heavy toll on our hometown heroes.

361
00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:45.907
After nine grueling innings
and several players out with injuries,

362
00:22:45.949 --> 00:22:49.077
the Acorns are scraping
the bottom of the roster.

363
00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:53.456
Hopefully, there's just enough muscle
on the bench to pull out a win.

364
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.335
Up next... Chicken Little.

365
00:23:00.547 --> 00:23:02.632
Clearly a long shot, folks.

366
00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:05.635
Little hasn't been up to bat
once since joining the team.

367
00:23:05.718 --> 00:23:08.388
- He's gonna lose the game for us!
- Wait!

368
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.432
If he can get a walk
and advance to first, that powerhouse

369
00:23:11.474 --> 00:23:15.228
Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all.

370
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:19.607
She's had a terrific game so far.
A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.

371
00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:22.360
OK, kid, listen up.

372
00:23:22.443 --> 00:23:25.154
You have an itty-bitty,
teeny-tiny strike zone.

373
00:23:25.196 --> 00:23:28.533
There's no way he can throw you out!
Take the walk. Don't swing.

374
00:23:28.616 --> 00:23:31.327
- I have a good feeling...
- Look at me. Don't swing.

375
00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:33.746
Take the walk. You hear me?
Just take the walk!

376
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.249
- But, coach, wait!
- Don't swing!

377
00:23:38.334 --> 00:23:41.421
Nervous, gangly,
barely able to hold the pine,

378
00:23:41.504 --> 00:23:44.632
Little advances to the box.
He's going to bat from the right.

379
00:23:44.674 --> 00:23:47.802
Make it the left. No, the right.

380
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:50.096
- The right.
- Easy out!

381
00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:53.182
Left field's
found something better to do,

382
00:23:53.266 --> 00:23:56.019
center field's got a hunger pang
in his second stomach

383
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.022
- and right field's digging for grubs.
- Play ball!

384
00:23:59.856 --> 00:24:01.274
Why him?

385
00:24:01.357 --> 00:24:04.193
Why now?

386
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:09.574
I won't embarrass you, Dad.
Not this time.

387
00:24:09.657 --> 00:24:12.910
Here's the wind-up,
the pitch! It's a high cutter.

388
00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:14.078
Ball!

389
00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:18.249
Uh... Strike one!

390
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:24.547
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes.

391
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.759
The catcher lays down
the signals. Here's the pitch.

392
00:24:27.842 --> 00:24:30.053
Curve ball low and outside, he swings!

393
00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:32.972
Stee-rike two!

394
00:24:33.056 --> 00:24:34.515
Ohh!

395
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:37.894
I said, don't swing!

396
00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:40.438
Don't swing!

397
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.650
- No!
- Batter up!

398
00:24:46.486 --> 00:24:47.987
That's two in the hole!

399
00:24:48.071 --> 00:24:50.156
One more strike,
it's a punch out, folks,

400
00:24:50.239 --> 00:24:52.784
and we're all going home.

401
00:24:55.745 --> 00:24:58.247
Today is a new day.

402
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.758
Don't swing!

403
00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.938
Well, take away my squeaky toy!
It's a hit!

404
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:24.023
-A hit?
-A hit?

405
00:25:24.107 --> 00:25:25.733
A hit?

406
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:31.531
The batter
is unbelievably at home plate.

407
00:25:31.614 --> 00:25:33.866
He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!

408
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.868
Go, son! Run! Run!

409
00:25:37.286 --> 00:25:38.329
Run!

410
00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:43.042
There he goes,
the wrong way.

411
00:25:43.126 --> 00:25:45.253
- Wait, wait, wait!
- No, no! Not that way!

412
00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:48.423
- Run the other way!
- Turn around!

413
00:25:48.464 --> 00:25:51.759
He's turned!
I've never said these words before,

414
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:53.845
but he's actually
rounding home plate!

415
00:25:53.928 --> 00:25:56.848
- Goosey steps on home...
- A new day!

416
00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:59.976
A tie game!
They're scrambling in the alley.

417
00:26:00.017 --> 00:26:03.104
Looks like Rodriguez has it.
Nope, it's the center fielder!

418
00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:06.149
Mayhem in the outfield,
as Rodriguez is fired to second.

419
00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:10.653
Catch is complete, but where's the ball?

420
00:26:10.737 --> 00:26:13.740
Little touches the bag
and keeps going. A hunt for the rock.

421
00:26:13.823 --> 00:26:16.617
The fielders are having trouble.
Commotion out there!

422
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:19.579
- It's stuck! It's stuck!
- Tip the cow!

423
00:26:19.662 --> 00:26:21.914
It's the old
tip-the-cow play.

424
00:26:21.998 --> 00:26:24.459
He heads for the hot corner,
a stand-up triple!

425
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.502
- Yes!
- Hold up! No!

426
00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:28.713
He's going for the whole enchilada!

427
00:26:28.796 --> 00:26:30.715
The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!

428
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:32.925
Go back! You're never gonna make it!

429
00:26:33.009 --> 00:26:36.012
Tries to lighten his load!

430
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:38.514
The outfield behind,
Little's on all cylinders!

431
00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:39.766
He slides for the dish!

432
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:43.811
It's going to be
a photo finish at home!

433
00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:52.779
You're out!

434
00:26:57.283 --> 00:27:00.286
Oh, folks.
Folks, what a heartbreaker.

435
00:27:00.369 --> 00:27:02.246
- Wait!
- Wait!

436
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:05.291
Wait a cotton-picking second.
Hold your horses, here,

437
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:09.170
and horses hold your breath.
This might not be over. He...

438
00:27:09.712 --> 00:27:12.298
He's...

439
00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:15.760
Safe! The runner is safe!

440
00:27:19.347 --> 00:27:21.516
It's all over, folks!

441
00:27:21.557 --> 00:27:24.101
The Acorns have done the impossible!

442
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:26.938
For the first time in 20 years,
we won the pennant!

443
00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:31.692
Mothers, kiss your babies!
You've witnessed a miracle!

444
00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:35.029
Remember where you were at this
moment. The smells! The sounds!

445
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.741
There's a new winner in town
and his name is Chicken Little!

446
00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:40.117
That was just a lucky hit!

447
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:42.870
Yes,
Chicken Little, it's all yours!

448
00:27:42.912 --> 00:27:45.498
The victory, the triumph, the glory!

449
00:27:45.581 --> 00:27:48.918
And getting doused with a sticky drink
that soaks into your undies

450
00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:50.878
and chafes for hours!

451
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.882
This is one memory you'll savor forever!

452
00:27:57.343 --> 00:27:58.803
Yeah!

453
00:28:00.471 --> 00:28:02.348
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

454
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:06.519
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!

455
00:28:06.602 --> 00:28:08.729

Here's the wind-up and the pitch!

465
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.905
- A knuckleball!
- He swings!

466
00:28:58.988 --> 00:29:00.072
- Crack!
- It's going.

467
00:29:00.156 --> 00:29:02.867
- He rounds first, to second!
- Hits high off the wall!

468
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.119
He flies past third
and heads for the plate!

469
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:08.080
It's a scramble for the ball!
It's gonna be close!

470
00:29:08.164 --> 00:29:11.208
He is safe!

471
00:29:11.292 --> 00:29:13.502
- The mighty Acorns win!
- Yes! Acorns win!

472
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.046
The mighty Acorns win!

473
00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:17.089
Yeah!

474
00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:29.852
Jeez, you know,

475
00:29:29.894 --> 00:29:33.230
I guess that puts the whole
"sky is falling" incident

476
00:29:33.314 --> 00:29:36.651
behind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo?

477
00:29:36.692 --> 00:29:38.778
You bet, Dad.

478
00:29:38.861 --> 00:29:42.073
I...

479
00:29:42.156 --> 00:29:46.035
Unless you think we need... closure?

480
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:48.412
Closure? What's to close here?

481
00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:50.331
Unless you think we need to close...

482
00:29:50.373 --> 00:29:51.666
- Not me.
- It's closed!

483
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:53.751
- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!

484
00:29:53.834 --> 00:29:56.921
OK, great, Dad. You... Closure, I dunno.

485
00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:05.638
All right. Enough fun.

486
00:30:05.721 --> 00:30:07.974
Good talk. Good talk, son.

487
00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:13.980
- Here, I'll give you a push.
- Rock me a little. Help me.

488
00:30:14.063 --> 00:30:16.649
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.

489
00:30:19.235 --> 00:30:20.236
Hey.

490
00:30:22.363 --> 00:30:24.573
Good night, Ace.

491
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:29.078
Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!

492
00:30:30.079 --> 00:30:31.330
Whoo-hoo!

493
00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:46.762
Thanks.

494
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:48.848
Thanks for the chance.

495
00:31:16.459 --> 00:31:18.294
Oh...

496
00:31:27.386 --> 00:31:29.263
No!

497
00:31:30.639 --> 00:31:32.016
A piece of the sky?!

498
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.643
Shaped like a stop sign?! Not again!

499
00:31:34.685 --> 00:31:36.979
Hey! Son!
You all right? I'm coming!

500
00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:39.607
I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs!

501
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.275
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

502
00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:43.319
You sure? I thought I heard you yell.

503
00:31:43.402 --> 00:31:44.612
No.

504
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:46.405
Uh, I, uh...

505
00:31:46.489 --> 00:31:48.199
I fell out of bed.

506
00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:51.619
Huh?

507
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.746
- How'd you get over there?
- Over where?

508
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.122
- There. There!
- Where?

509
00:31:55.164 --> 00:31:57.500
How'd you get over there?

510
00:31:57.541 --> 00:31:59.001
Who're we talking about?

511
00:32:01.879 --> 00:32:05.674
Never mind. What's the difference?
Look, the past is behind us, right?

512
00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:08.511
-Mmm.
- Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

513
00:32:12.807 --> 00:32:16.685
Please be gone,

There hasn't been

00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:41.914
- "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
- There was talking.

547
00:34:41.997 --> 00:34:45.584

- Really? What did he say?

All right, that's it.
We are doing an intervention!

00:34:53.175 --> 00:34:56.345
You have got to stop messing around
and deal with the problem!

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:58.013
- She's right!
-Abby, please.

553
00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.474
This is exactly what
fell on me the first time.

554
00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:02.726
There's no way I'm
bringing this up again.

- No, he's not.
- Runt!

556
00:35:04.103 --> 00:35:06.522
Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flapper.

557
00:35:06.605 --> 00:35:10.192
OK. I'm sure there's
a simple, logical explanation.

558
00:35:10.276 --> 00:35:12.611
I mean, it could be
a piece of weather balloon,

559
00:35:12.695 --> 00:35:16.240
or maybe it's part of some
experimental communications satellite.

560
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:18.993
I don't care. I want it
out of my life, gone for good.

562
00:35:22.538 --> 00:35:26.458
Hey, remember when
that icy blue stuff fell from the sky?

563
00:35:26.542 --> 00:35:29.128
Everybody thought it was
from space and stuff?

564
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:33.674
And it just turned out to be
frozen pee from a jet airplane.

565
00:35:33.716 --> 00:35:36.510
Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee.

566
00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:39.888
Yeah. It's frozen pee.
Pee, pee, pee, pee pee.

567
00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:42.433
- Could you stop saying that?
- What? Pee?

568
00:35:42.516 --> 00:35:43.600
- Pee.
- Tinkle?

569
00:35:43.684 --> 00:35:45.019
- Piddle? Wee-wee?
- Whiz?

570
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.603
OK, subject change.

571
00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:50.482
- Make pishee?
- I don't care what it is!

572
00:35:52.568 --> 00:35:55.696
Are you gonna
help me get rid of it or not?

573
00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:17.676

574
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.094

575
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:22.973
- No!

576
00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:35.361
Aaah!

577
00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.446
Come on, come on, come on!

578
00:36:37.488 --> 00:36:40.866
Wait, wait, whoa, son!
Where's the fire here?

579
00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:45.829
Chicken Little has something
to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.

580
00:36:48.123 --> 00:36:49.750
Who're we talkin' about?

581
00:36:49.792 --> 00:36:51.794
Uh...

582
00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:53.212
Gotta go, Dad! Bye!

583
00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:56.840
Ha! You got to be ready
to listen to your children,

584
00:36:56.924 --> 00:36:59.510
even if they have nothing to say.

585
00:37:01.136 --> 00:37:04.807
- Sit tight, Fish!
- Fish! We will try to save you!

586
00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.809
Yeah!

587
00:37:11.188 --> 00:37:13.482
I'm sorry! Wait!

588
00:37:16.527 --> 00:37:17.736
Sorry!

589
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:20.864
- Curb!
- Ay!

592
00:38:58.086 --> 00:38:59.838
Abby! Wake up!

593
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.092
Come on! Let's get outta here!

594
00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:53.433
Oh, poor Fish!

595
00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:57.145
He's probably stuffed and mounted
like an intergalactic trophy or...

596
00:39:57.229 --> 00:39:59.189
...maybe he's a half-living host

597
00:39:59.273 --> 00:40:03.318
implanted with
their face-hugging embryo babies.

598
00:40:03.402 --> 00:40:06.196
One thing's for sure, man. He's gone!

599
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.991
- Gone, man!
- Not yet!

600
00:40:12.953 --> 00:40:15.205
Oh, snap.

601
00:40:38.645 --> 00:40:40.480
Fish.

602
00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:21.563
Hey! What are you doing? Come on!

603
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.117
Fish.

604
00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:36.203
Fish.

605
00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:37.496
Fish.

606
00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:39.081
Fish.

607
00:41:39.164 --> 00:41:42.125
- Where are you, Fish?!
- Shh!

608
00:41:42.209 --> 00:41:44.753
I can't handle the pressure!
Go on without me!

609
00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:46.338
- Runt.
- You're just fine.

610
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:48.882
I'll jeopardize the mission!
Endanger us all!

611
00:41:48.924 --> 00:41:51.551
Throw me overboard
while you still have a chance!

612
00:41:51.593 --> 00:41:54.638

613
00:41:54.721 --> 00:41:56.098

- Everything's OK.

00:49:46.568 --> 00:49:49.279
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

689
00:49:52.073 --> 00:49:55.076
Come on. Come on.
You're about to see it!

690
00:49:57.871 --> 00:49:59.706
Quick! It's taking off!

691
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:02.333
Come on! If you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss it!

692
00:50:02.417 --> 00:50:04.460
Oh, look! A penny!

693
00:50:04.544 --> 00:50:07.547
- Guys!
- Oh, right.

694
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:14.262
Hurry! Hurry!

695
00:50:15.638 --> 00:50:17.557
Come on! Quick! It's taking off!

696
00:50:17.599 --> 00:50:20.268
Come on! Hurry up!
Please! It's right in...

697
00:50:22.103 --> 00:50:23.980
What are we lookin' for?

698
00:50:24.063 --> 00:50:27.317
I don't know.

699
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.652
Uh, yeah. OK.
I know this looks bad,

700
00:50:29.736 --> 00:50:32.614
but there's an invisible
spaceship right there

701
00:50:32.697 --> 00:50:34.866
with aliens
who are here to invade Earth!

702
00:50:34.949 --> 00:50:37.243
Let me show you.

703
00:50:38.578 --> 00:50:39.662
Ooh, bad throw.

704
00:50:39.746 --> 00:50:41.748
OK, let me try again.

705
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:44.500
- Bad throw.
- We all know I don't have a good arm,

706
00:50:44.584 --> 00:50:47.086
but there's these
cloaking panels on the bottom.

707
00:50:47.128 --> 00:50:50.882
They make it disappear. One fell out
of the sky and hit me right on the head.

708
00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:53.718
Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.

709
00:50:53.801 --> 00:50:55.136
Eh, there's no story here.

710
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.889
At least we can sell the video
to <i>Chickens</i> Gone Wild.

711
00:50:57.972 --> 00:51:01.392
- I'm telling ya, it was here!
- No, wait! There were aliens!

712
00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:04.896
It's true! They had eyes...
They're glowing and then tentacles!

713
00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:08.024
And maps with planets
with X's through them! Aah!

714
00:51:08.107 --> 00:51:09.567
Runt, that's enough!

715
00:51:09.651 --> 00:51:12.654
Don't make Mommy take away
your Streisand collection!

716
00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:15.573
Mom? You leave Barbra out of this!

717
00:51:15.657 --> 00:51:19.285
Why can't you keep
that child of yours under control?

718
00:51:19.327 --> 00:51:20.745
What kind of parent are you?

719
00:51:20.828 --> 00:51:22.872
I'm telling the truth.

720
00:51:22.956 --> 00:51:27.669
Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up!

721
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.296
You gotta believe me this time.

722
00:51:39.764 --> 00:51:43.184
No, son. I don't.

723
00:51:45.979 --> 00:51:49.816
I can't tell you
how embarrassed I am, folks.

724
00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:53.111
I'm really sorry about this, everyone.

725
00:51:53.194 --> 00:51:59.200
Looks like this is just
a big, crazy misunderstanding.

726
00:51:59.242 --> 00:52:03.705
Well, other than the penny,
this whole evening was a wash!

727
00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:09.502
Mr. Cluck, don't take it
so hard. No one blames you.

728
00:53:21.783 --> 00:53:24.494
<i>Reports of panic
and mayhem are pouring in</i>

729
00:53:24.577 --> 00:53:27.413
<i>after yet another Chicken Little
incident last night.</i>

730
00:53:27.455 --> 00:53:30.625
<i>In one instance, a family
of lemmings was sent running in fear,</i>

731
00:53:30.708 --> 00:53:34.128
<i>but unable to find a cliff, they
instead began throwing themselves</i>

732
00:53:35.296 --> 00:53:37.757
<i>- From the nearest park bench.</i>
- Hello? <i>I'm</i> sorry.

733
00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:40.009
Hello? I apologize.
Hello? Give me a break!

734
00:53:40.093 --> 00:53:42.804
What? You were trampled?
That's terrible.

735
00:53:42.845 --> 00:53:46.015
I thought rabbits' feet
were supposed to be lucky.

736
00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:49.477
- <i>You have hate mail.</i>
- Sorry. That wasn't very funny.

737
00:53:49.519 --> 00:53:53.106
- <i>You have more hate mail.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i> What <i>are you</i> saying, sir?

738
00:53:53.147 --> 00:53:55.191
<i>Your hate mail box is full.</i>

739
00:53:55.274 --> 00:53:58.611
Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there.

740
00:53:58.653 --> 00:54:02.740
Thank goodness the cloud
blocked the last letter. Hello?

741
00:54:02.824 --> 00:54:05.743
Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah?

742
00:54:05.827 --> 00:54:09.497
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'd like to see you try.

743
00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:12.417
OK, I love you too, Mom. Bye.

744
00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:15.753
Hello? Really. Well...

745
00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:35.690
If there was ever a time
to talk to your dad...

746
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:37.900
...it's now.

747
00:54:40.903 --> 00:54:42.738
It's too late for that.

748
00:54:44.282 --> 00:54:48.286
It's too late, baby, now it's too late.

749
00:54:48.369 --> 00:54:51.289
Though they
really did try to make it.

750
00:54:51.372 --> 00:54:52.999
Runt.

751
00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:55.376
Just think about it.

752
00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.130
Something inside has died
and they just can't hide

753
00:54:59.213 --> 00:55:03.926
and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.

754
00:55:07.555 --> 00:55:10.516
Runt, I really just want
to be alone right now.

755
00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.070
Oh! Abby! Runt! Fish!

756
00:55:23.112 --> 00:55:25.948
Look! There!
Look there! Look there!

757
00:55:26.032 --> 00:55:28.034
- What is that thing?!
- Look at that!

758
00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:39.587
- His name is Kirby?
- They left him behind?

759
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:41.297
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

760
00:55:43.257 --> 00:55:45.426
No, don't...
Come on, come on, don't cry.

761
00:55:45.468 --> 00:55:49.805
We're here for you. We're gonna do
whatever it takes to get you back home.

762
00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:52.517
Here, blow.

763
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.019
OK.

764
00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:05.905
See, guys? He's cool.
He was just freaked out. That's all.

765
00:56:05.947 --> 00:56:07.949
Ah-choo!

766
00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:00.042
Whoa.

767
00:57:00.126 --> 00:57:01.168
Run!

768
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:15.600
Those are your parents?

769
00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:18.352
And they brought the galactic armada?

770
00:57:22.356 --> 00:57:25.943
- Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
- There you are. Get in the car.

771
00:57:26.027 --> 00:57:27.862
- I gotta tell you something.
- What?

772
00:57:27.945 --> 00:57:31.240
I know, I know! You were right!
Alien invasion. I see that now.

773
00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:32.408
Look up! There it is!

774
00:57:32.491 --> 00:57:34.619
Dad, you know, about that...

775
00:57:34.702 --> 00:57:37.371
- It's actually a rescue mission.
- Rescue mission?

776
00:57:37.413 --> 00:57:40.333
This alien kid was left
and they're coming back to get him!

777
00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:43.044
We have to help him,
'cause if we don't, who else will?

778
00:57:43.127 --> 00:57:44.795
What?!

779
00:57:44.879 --> 00:57:45.963
Ugh!

780
00:57:46.047 --> 00:57:49.425
Forget it.
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

781
00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:51.093
Son!

782
00:57:51.177 --> 00:57:55.139
Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!

783
00:57:55.222 --> 00:57:57.808
Mr. Cluck! Wait! He's telling the truth!

784
00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:58.893
He is!

785
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:02.229
Given his track record, we understand
why you don't believe him!

What are you guys doing?
We gotta get outta here!

It's like War of the <i>Worlds</i> out there!

- Stop pulling!
- Just listen to me for one second!

803
00:59:32.236 --> 00:59:34.447
- It's not dangerous!
- We are under attack!

804
00:59:34.488 --> 00:59:38.117
Will you two stop messing around
and deal with the problem?

00:59:40.578 --> 00:59:42.663
- You're never there for me!
- What?

806
00:59:42.705 --> 00:59:44.707
OK, that's not
what I had in mind, but...

807
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:46.667
You're never there for me. I mean,

808
00:59:46.709 --> 00:59:50.004
you were when I won the game,
but not when I thought the sky fell.

809
00:59:50.045 --> 00:59:51.881
And not at the ball field and not now!

810
00:59:51.964 --> 00:59:53.841
This is good! Keep going. Keep going!

811
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:56.177
You've been ashamed
since the acorn thing.

812
00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.346
We have to talk because
<i>Modern Mallard</i> says avoiding closure

813
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.390
can lead to molting. I'm already small

814
01:00:01.474 --> 01:00:04.101
and I don't think
I could handle being bald!

815
01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.646
I...

816
01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:11.150
I... I didn't...

817
01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.944
...realize, son.

818
01:00:14.028 --> 01:00:17.573
I-I never meant to...

819
01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.785
The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole...

820
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:26.499
You're right. You're right.

821
01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:35.716
Y... Your mom, she was...

822
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.804
You know, she was always good
with stuff like this.

823
01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:46.227
Me...

824
01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.521
...I'm gonna need a lot of work.

825
01:00:50.731 --> 01:00:53.400
But you need to know that I love you,

826
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:56.028
no matter what.

827
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:58.489
And I'm sorry I...

828
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:06.622
And I'm sorry if I ever made
you feel like that was something...

829
01:01:07.414 --> 01:01:09.667
...you had to earn.

830
01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.555
Uh... uh...

831
01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:27.768
And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.

832
01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.728
OK, Dad.

833
01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.231
All we gotta do
is return helpless little Kirby.

834
01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:38.904
Return this whatever it is?

835
01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:41.699
This is crazy! Crazy!

836
01:01:41.782 --> 01:01:43.534
Crazy wonderful!

837
01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:45.619
Just tell me what you need me to do.

838
01:01:45.703 --> 01:01:49.206
- Do you really mean it?
- You bet! Anything, son.

839
01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:53.961
Come on, Dad.
We've got a planet to save!

840
01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:59.008
Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh!

841
01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:02.386
This thing likes to nibble,
doesn't it?

842
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.101
By the way, I'd like to say I've
always found you extremely attractive!

843
01:02:17.151 --> 01:02:21.030
Now that's closure.

844
01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:27.077
Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?!

845
01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:34.710
Oh, they've given her
an alien mind-wipe!

846
01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.503
Aaah!

847
01:02:37.338 --> 01:02:39.006
OK, son. What do we do now?

848
01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.925
Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad.

849
01:02:41.008 --> 01:02:44.678
All we have to do is take the kid down
the street to the giant metal alien.

850
01:02:46.805 --> 01:02:50.100
We surrender! Here!
Take the key to the city!

851
01:02:50.184 --> 01:02:52.311
Key to my car?

852
01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:54.980
Tic Tac?

853
01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.817
Forget plan A!

854
01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:03.572
Uh-oh.

855
01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.252
OK, OK, what now, son?

856
01:03:17.336 --> 01:03:19.755
Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.

857
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:23.008
- Uh, plan B?
- Ha-ha! Of course! Plan B!

858
01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.844
What is plan B?

859
01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.555
What? You have to go
to the bathroom? You want juice?

860
01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.683
A snack? Corn dog on a stick?

861
01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.893
Want to play some golf?
What do you want?!

862
01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.229
I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.

863
01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:37.648
No, no, I am.

864
01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.277
Poo-tee-tah.

865
01:03:43.696 --> 01:03:45.239
Oh. Is that your parents?

866
01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.282
Pooteetah, pooteetah.

867
01:03:47.366 --> 01:03:49.201
That's it, Dad! Plan B!

868
01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:52.413
All we have to do is weave
through traffic through town square

869
01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:54.832
while avoiding death rays
from alien robots.

870
01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:57.126
We get to Town Hall,
climb up to the roof

871
01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.086
and give the kid back to its parents.

872
01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:03.298
Yeah!

873
01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.427
Charge!

874
01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:15.436
Wow!

875
01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:29.074
A-ha!

876
01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:32.619
Now that's what I call
takin' out the trash!

877
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.922
OK, son. Now what?

878
01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:45.257
Fire truck!

879
01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:52.014
Plan C!

880
01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:58.103
Runt, no! Turn around!

881
01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:01.190
- Go back to Town Hall!
- But they'll vaporize us!

882
01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:06.111
- You want me to do what?
- Runt, just do it! It'll work!

883
01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:08.155
We'll survive!

884
01:05:09.198 --> 01:05:11.992
I will survive?

885
01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:13.744
Brake, Abby!

886
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.496
<i>OK.</i>

887
01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:18.665
- Floor it!
- Boink.

888
01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:24.463
Deploy ladder, Fish!

889
01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.139
<i>♪ I'll survive</i>

890
01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:37.267
<i>♪ I will survive
Hey, hey ♪</i>

891
01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:44.691
- Plan D.
- Plan D!

892
01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:46.235
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

893
01:05:46.318 --> 01:05:49.822
Thighs hurting.
Drumsticks burning.

894
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:53.075
But loving you!

895
01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:54.535
Full support!

896
01:06:03.502 --> 01:06:06.130
I can't get out! Come back, son!

897
01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:08.257
We can't go out this way!
It's dangerous.

898
01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.592
- No, Dad, I can do this!
- It's too dangerous.

899
01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:12.719
I can do this. I can.

900
01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.140
You gotta believe me this time.

901
01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:17.766
I...

902
01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:22.104
I do, son.

903
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:26.692
OK, hang on tight.

904
01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:38.287
- Yes!
- Here's your kid! Look over here!

905
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.038
Here's your kid!

906
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.790
He's OK!

907
01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:51.633
He's all right!
Stop the invasion!

908
01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:54.636
Son! Son!

909
01:06:57.097 --> 01:06:59.349
Aaaah!

910
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.273
- I'm here, son!
- Dad! Look out!

911
01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:09.276
Get away from my boy! Get away!

912
01:07:15.199 --> 01:07:17.910
The mighty Acorns...

913
01:07:27.461 --> 01:07:29.504
Tic Tac?

914
01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:34.468
Why did you take our child?

915
01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:38.138
Hey, hey! Just...
Just hold on there, buddy!

916
01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:40.432
My son did not take your kid!

917
01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:42.392
You were the one
that left him behind!

918
01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:45.270
That's bad parenting! And I should know!

919
01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:47.481
Silence!

920
01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:50.609
Release the child!

921
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:52.819
-OK.
-OK, OK.

922
01:07:56.448 --> 01:08:00.911
Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby,
I'm so happy to see you! My darling!

923
01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:04.039
- That was close.
- At least they're back together.

924
01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.499
They got their kid.

925
01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:09.628
You have violated
intergalactic law 90210!

926
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:14.716
A charge punishable
by immediate particle disintegration!

927
01:08:18.178 --> 01:08:20.138
Oh, snap.

928
01:08:22.683 --> 01:08:24.977
Hmm? What's that?

929
01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:26.311
Hmm. I...

930
01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:28.647
I don't quite...

931
01:08:28.689 --> 01:08:32.192
Melvin, honey?
He's saying they're telling the truth.

932
01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:34.111
It was just a misunderstanding.

933
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.449
Well, then. This is awkward.

934
01:08:39.533 --> 01:08:41.493
- Yes, it is.
- I suppose I should...

935
01:08:41.535 --> 01:08:44.246
- Put the big guns away?
- Yes, yes.

936
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:47.124
- Now put them down.
- Of course.

937
01:08:49.209 --> 01:08:52.004
- And turn off your big voice.
- But I don't...

938
01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.547
- Turn it off.
- But...

939
01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:56.008
But I don't get to use
the big voice very often!

940
01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:57.551
Melvin.

941
01:08:57.592 --> 01:08:59.845
Yes, dear.

942
01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:08.145
Hi. Uh, anyone want
to try the big voice?

943
01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:15.235
Again,
I cannot tell you how sorry we are

944
01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:17.112
for this whole misunderstanding.

945
01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:19.489
Oh, dear goodness.
We are so very sorry.

946
01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:22.034
We are. And if it hadn't
been for your son there,

947
01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.786
well, we might have
vaporized the whole planet.

948
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:25.996
What?

949
01:09:26.079 --> 01:09:28.373
Goodness! What a shame
that would have been.

950
01:09:28.415 --> 01:09:30.292
Where else would we pick our acorns?

951
01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:33.003
- We stop on the way to the in-laws.
- Every year.

952
01:09:33.086 --> 01:09:36.256
Looked on all the other planets.
You only find them on Earth.

953
01:09:36.298 --> 01:09:39.134
Just as it says here
on your primitive graphic display.

954
01:09:39.217 --> 01:09:41.428
That caught our eyes.

955
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:44.222
OK, everything's been
put back to normal,

956
01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:46.475
except for this one, over here.

957
01:09:46.558 --> 01:09:48.018
Hi, y'all!

958
01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:49.436
Foxy?

959
01:09:49.478 --> 01:09:52.105
<i>♪ Lollipop, lollipop
Oh, lolli lolli lolli</i>

960
01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:53.398
<i>♪ Lollipop...</i>

961
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.943
She got her brainwaves
scrambled during reconstitution.

962
01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:59.404
No worries! We can put
her back the way she was.

963
01:09:59.446 --> 01:10:01.948
No! She's perfect.

964
01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:03.950
<i>♪ Lollipop!

965
01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:06.411

966
01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:09.039
Darling! Look at the time!
We better get a move on.

967
01:10:09.623 --> 01:10:11.958
All right, then.
It was good meetin' ya.

968
01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:14.878
Sorry for the whole
full-scale invasion thing.

969
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:18.423
But, hey, I'm a dad.
You know how it is with your kids.

970
01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:22.594
When they need ya,
you do whatever it takes.

971
01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:28.642
There goes that panel again.

972
01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.852
Every year we come,
this thing falls off.

973
01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:33.522
Someday it's going
to hit somebody on the head.

974
01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:35.315
Nonsense!

975
01:10:35.357 --> 01:10:36.858
You can't return the panel.

976
01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:40.070
- Now that's ridiculous.
- You threw away the receipt again.

977
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:41.613
Silence!

978
01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:44.825
Melvin, did you just try
and use the big voice on me?

979
01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:47.786
Um... uh...

980
01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:49.704
Who we talkin' about?

981
01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:55.710
So I'd like to see the movie
they make about you now.

982
01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.463
I just hope they stay true
to what really happened.

983
01:10:58.505 --> 01:11:01.258
Oh, son, these people
are from Hollywood!

984
01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:03.385
One thing they'll never do

985
01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:06.471
is mess with a good story.

986
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.809
Red alert!
Man your battle stations!

987
01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:13.562
Status report, Mr. Fish.

988
01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:16.022
Commander Little,
the evil Foxloxian Army

989
01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:18.608
has broken through
the planet's atmosphere.

990
01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:21.111
But that means...

991
01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:25.323
Yes, I know. The sky... is falling.

992
01:11:25.365 --> 01:11:27.075
Commander Little! No!

993
01:11:27.159 --> 01:11:30.203
Please... call me...

994
01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:31.496
...Ace.

995
01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.290
Oh, Ace! No!

996
01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:37.669
I never intended to
bring you into this... Abby.

997
01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:40.046
- Runt, <i>do you</i> copy?
<i>- Yes, commander?</i>

998
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:44.217
Runt, my friend, an alien fleet
is about to invade Earth.

999
01:11:44.301 --> 01:11:47.929
Civilization as we know it depends on me

1000
01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:51.683
and, to a lesser extent... you.

1001
01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:55.312
So I've just got one question for you:

1002
01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:57.898
Are you ready to rock?

1003
01:11:57.939 --> 01:12:02.486
Ain't no mountain high enough,
ain't no valley low...

1004
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.575
Raise your pork shield,
Runt. Prepare to engage.

1005
01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:15.332
<i>Stay on target. Stay on target!</i>

1006
01:12:15.415 --> 01:12:18.001
<i>Give 'em a taste
of the other white meat!</i>

1007
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:20.420
Cap 'n! <i>Look out!</i>

1008
01:12:20.462 --> 01:12:21.463
<i>Runt!</i>

1009
01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:23.089
<i>Runt, are you a" right?</i>

1010
01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:27.260
<i>No, no. Ya gotta
go on without me, commander.</i>

1011
01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:33.141
<i>Just leave me some ammo, a little water,</i>

1012
01:12:33.225 --> 01:12:35.185
<i>some chips if you have 'em.</i>

1013
01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:38.104
This is amazingly accurate.

1014
01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:43.944
<i>He was my good friend.</i>

1015
01:12:43.985 --> 01:12:45.695
<i>Oh, Abby.</i>

1016
01:12:45.779 --> 01:12:49.366
<i>At least I still have you... Abby.</i>

1017
01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:51.451
