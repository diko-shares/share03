00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:20,533
Come, Phoenix!
The harvest's good this year!

2
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,001
I'm coming!

3
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,203
Cuz, come quick, it's getting late!

4
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,741
Cuz, come quick, it's getting late!

5
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,852
Heart of green cabbage
Heart of white cabbage

6
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,351
You've got a good heart, cuz!

7
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,548
Green weeds, white weeds
You've got talent, cuz!

8
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,853
Our cuz has great talent
Has great talent

9
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,222
I like you, cuz!

10
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,997
The sun is coming out!

11
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,730
The sun is coming out!

12
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,434
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

13
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,731
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

14
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,104
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

15
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,610
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

16
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,908
The moon is full
The moon is smiling

17
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:07,109
Let's sing to our year
Of good harvest!

18
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,916
Let's dance to our year
Of good harvest!

19
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,815
Breakfast is ready, Dad!

20
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,323
Begin!

21
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,928
One. Two.

22
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,591
Three.

23
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,396
The lyre is finely played, big cuz

24
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,976
The shoes are finely embroidered
Little cuz

25
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,512
It's good fun, so much fun
Real good fun

26
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,981
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

27
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,485
The full moon falls on the 1 5th

28
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,818
But boys and girls fall
For each other tonight

29
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,821
Yeah, yeah, yeah

30
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,012
Here you are!

31
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,161
Good to see you all. Come inside.

32
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,865
My good friends...

33
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,110
...thanks to your faith in me...

34
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,077
...I've been a success in the city.

35
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,576
I'm now recruiting staff
for my factory.

36
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,550
But instead of taking on strangers...

37
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,555
...I'd rather employ people I know.

38
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,625
That's why I'm here...

39
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:03,887
...to see if anyone
wants to come work for me.

40
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,761
I only have 1 0 openings, mind.

41
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,728
But if anyone is interested,
put up your hand.

42
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,737
Really? So many of you?

43
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,273
Let's think of a way to do this fairly.

44
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,547
-Don't want any hard feelings, right?
-Right!

45
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,981
The main thing
is no matter who's chosen...

46
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,484
...we remain friends. Right?

47
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,212
Right!

48
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,484
It's mine! It's mine!

49
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,017
Phoenix!

50
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,828
Got it!

51
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:58,536
The cock is crowing
Rise and shine, and let's get busy

52
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:06,652
The girls are transplanting seedlings
In the field

53
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,052
-Dinner.
-Let's eat.

54
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,362
My darling girl.

55
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,128
Sure you want to move to the city?
All those people. And the traffic!

56
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,564
It's a dangerous world, Dad!

57
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,442
You can come back
anytime you like.

58
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,078
There's no shortage
of good-lookers here.

59
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:39,942
Here's a drumstick. Eat up!

60
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,518
Be my guest.

61
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,257
You take this! I'll help myself!

62
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,952
Eat the butt.

63
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,954
I've had enough!

64
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,266
Do we have to do that stupid routine
every time we eat?

65
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:30,697
It's not stupid.

66
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,804
It's about training your reflexes.

67
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,668
You might need
to defend yourself one day.

68
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,399
Can't you understand that?

69
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,772
Ever since I was small,
all these kung fu moves.

70
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,176
Tai-chi, Wing-tsun,
the One Point Power Finger.

71
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,475
I just can't see the point.
Kung fu's boring.

72
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,015
But you do love to dance.

73
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,852
Dancing's totally different.

74
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,488
No! They walk hand-in-hand.

75
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,392
Dancing and kung fu
come from the same place.

76
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,419
Never mind.

77
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,064
Since your mom died,
I'm the only man in the family.

78
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,630
Kung fu's all I can teach you.

79
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,325
Speaking of Mom,
where's that floral skirt she left me?

80
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,265
It was far too short. I threw it away.

81
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,871
What?

82
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,199
Look into my eyes.

83
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,902
It never fails to work.

84
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,878
No one can fool me
when I look in their eyes.

85
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,387
Dad. Please don't worry.

86
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:17,004
You'll need money when you get
to the city. This is my life's savings.

87
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,474
It's six or seven hundred dollars.
Take it.

88
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,669
It's too much!

89
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,314
Don't fuss about it.
It was meant for your dowry.

90
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,212
Don't throw it away. And don't
blame me if no one will marry you!

91
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,750
Dad!

92
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,582
If you have any worries,
write me at once...

93
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,314
...and I'll come to rescue you.

94
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,482
Write?

95
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,667
This is what they use in the city.

96
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,965
It's a portable cassette tape recorder.
Very high-tech.

97
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,539
And this is a cassette tape.

98
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,236
It works just like the one by your bed.
You put it in and press the button.

99
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,778
This way,
you'll know what I'm up to.

100
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,241
So I can stop worrying now?

101
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,348
Hey, what's the matter?

102
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,283
What's up?

103
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,983
Look! A shooting star!

104
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,459
I'm wishing I'll get rich in the city.

105
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,623
No, wait. I want longer legs...

106
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,769
...smaller waist, bigger boobs.

107
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,702
No, no. I want to find my
perfect man. That's my wish.

108
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,539
Whatever.

109
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,678
I made those wishes.

110
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,904
Really thought they'd come true.

111
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,981
But I'm still stuck here.

112
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,642
If only I could get to the city,
I'd definitely be a success.

113
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,447
I will make it somehow!

114
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,719
Oh, you're pissed
you're not going to the city?

115
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,261
Yeah.

116
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,290
Here. Have this.

117
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,337
Letter of Employment

118
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,338
But what about you?

119
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,344
Forget the work.
I just want to go to the city.

120
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,641
Phoenix, you're a pal!

121
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,910
You're so great!

122
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,752
But how will you live without a job?

123
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,794
No worries.

124
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,898
I'll work hard
on becoming a celebrity.

125
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,035
Then I'll be able to look after you.

126
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,605
Let's go to the city!

127
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,505
City! Here we come!

128
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,373
Snow!

129
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,140
Snow!

130
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,347
Snow!

131
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,814
Snow! Snow!

132
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,952
Snow!

133
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,793
Where were you? What's that?

134
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,007
Of course. Okay.

135
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,204
Just trust me!

136
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,748
Don't mention it. It was my pleasure.

137
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,451
Goodbye!

138
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,955
That's me in the photographs.

139
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,493
Girls wouldn't look at me before...

140
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,688
...but I don't have that problem now.

141
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,257
Now, let's get down to business.

142
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,369
What can I do for you?

143
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:44,476
Breast job. Facelift.
All pretty routine.

144
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:45,871
How much does it cost?

145
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,774
Not much. Around--

146
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,806
Around $200,000.

147
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,711
I don't have that.
Can you do it any cheaper?

148
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,652
I graduated from Harvard.

149
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,689
That's why I charge more
than the others.

150
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,419
I understand your problem.
But I'm worth it.

151
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,166
Is it safe? Are there side effects?

152
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,343
Will it look real? Will things fall off?

153
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,172
No, of course not.

154
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,508
I'm a Harvard man. It'll be fine!

155
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:32,084
Damn! It keeps falling off.

156
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,660
That's it, take it easy. One at a time.

157
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,094
Move down the bus!

158
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,461
Did you catch it off the doctor?

159
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,727
I have no idea.

160
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,268
-Thanks.
-Okay.

161
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,106
Here's the address.
Don't wander too far.

162
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,771
Make sure you get back tonight.

163
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,918
-I understand.
-Be careful!

164
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,782
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

165
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,729
Nice moves!

166
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,736
Well, I am a dancer.
In my village dance group.

167
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,305
I can tell.

168
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,636
Actually, I'm a talent scout.

169
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,534
What's that?

170
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,343
It doesn't matter.

171
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,847
The point is, do you want to be
a great dancer?

172
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,709
Yes, I do!

173
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,554
Then you should enter
the street-dance competition.

174
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,157
How do I do that?

175
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,385
First off, you need a manager.
That's me.

176
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,459
You've got potential.
I guarantee you'll make it!

177
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,231
Why are you staring at me?

178
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,460
Is it because I look rather Eurasian?

179
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,968
I'm trying to tell if you're lying.

180
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,632
Why would I lie?
Do you have $1 000 on you?

181
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:06,902
Nope.

182
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,639
Why would I try to cheat you
out of money you don't have?

183
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,839
How much do you have?

184
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,379
Just over $500.

185
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,489
-Had enough?
-Yes!

186
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,058
About time.

187
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,496
Let me help you enroll
for the competition.

188
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,862
Where's your $500?

189
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,367
I don't have it.

190
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,335
I thought you said you had $500.

191
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,940
I have. My friend's got it.

192
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,872
How are we going to get it?

193
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,602
I'll ask her for it.

194
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,337
Where is your friend?

195
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,713
She's working in a factory
in Song Jiang.

196
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,719
So who's paying for this food?

197
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,282
I haven't any money.

198
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,151
Why don't you go get it from her?

199
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,820
How long does it take
to walk to Song Jiang?

200
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,592
About two days.
What about taking a car?

201
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,125
I haven't any money!

202
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,516
Thank you, sir!

203
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,521
Hey! What do you want?

204
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,059
I'm looking for someone.

205
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,253
Can't you read?

206
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,557
"No visitors during working hours."

207
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,227
But it's after hours now.

208
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,663
"No visitors after working hours."

209
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,735
Please let me in, sir. It's urgent!

210
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,002
Can't do that.

211
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,443
Please, sir! Please!

212
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,284
Who's that?

213
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,855
Why are you so late?

214
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,169
That was a close shave! Running into
a bad guy on her first day in town.

215
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,501
You have to be careful
with these city people.

216
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,972
What do you mean, "bad guy"?

217
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,771
He bought me lunch
and gave me bus money.

218
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,178
Where did you get all the luck?

219
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:35,686
Even if he isn't a real talent scout,
I know I want to--

220
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,750
Why are you standing around
like lame ducks?

221
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,445
Want me to shoot you all
in the ass?

222
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:19,990
Whoa, instant coffee.

223
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,032
You people know how to
treat yourselves. Make me a cup.

224
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,795
-There's no hot water.
-So boil some!

225
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:37,008
It smells like shit in here.
Don't you ever wash your clothes?

226
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,789
Coffee's ready.

227
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,802
I can't hold it in anymore.
I must sing!

228
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,202
We live in the country, yeah

229
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:08,938
We go to town to work, yeah

230
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,517
We make some money
And bring it home, yeah

231
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:19,055
To give it to Dad and Mom, yeah

232
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,954
What's with you crazy peasants?
Singing in the middle of the night!

233
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,961
-ls this what you do in the country?
-Here's your coffee.

234
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,264
Go to bed.

235
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,914
What were you saying?

236
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,217
I just want to dance!

237
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,337
Sure. I'll let him know.

238
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,251
Your girlfriend left her earrings
at your place.

239
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,183
She's not my girlfriend.

240
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,322
Why are you here so often, boss?

241
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,898
You're so busy.
Can't you delegate this?

242
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,695
After all, it's only a dance school.

243
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,999
I agree the dance school
isn't profitable.

244
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,368
But it creates a good image
for our brand.

245
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,011
And it provides important publicity.

246
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,612
We need to expand the business
into the youth market.

247
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,612
So the cost doesn't worry me.

248
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,648
Grace is on the line from Shanghai.

249
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,617
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-Get Samuel on the line.

250
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,286
Samuel. How's it going?

251
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:05,088
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

252
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,823
The Challenge the World street-dance
championship is coming up.

253
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,399
The best of our students are here.

254
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,232
Would you have time to stop by
and say hello? They'd love to see you.

255
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,604
That's all right. You say hello for me.
I have to go now.

256
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,909
Miss Chang has arrived.
She's downstairs. Your keys.

257
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,668
What? Two thousand dollars a month
for dance classes!

258
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,136
And a beginner's session is $1 50.

259
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,467
It's too much!

260
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,167
I shopped around.
They all charge the same.

261
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,813
Hold it right there!

262
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,902
You think this is a hotel?
Do you think I'm blind?

263
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:25,600
Which one of you girls
isn't from the country?

264
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,644
Which one of you isn't poor
as a church mouse?

265
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,305
Which one of you doesn't have a sick
father and a mother in need of surgery?

266
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,647
Which one of you hasn't a dream
with no hope of realizing it?

267
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,482
What makes you any different
from them?

268
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,027
If you want a meal ticket, forget it!

269
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,290
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
You want food, you earn it.

270
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:50,935
Get to bed.
Works starts early tomorrow.

271
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,468
You want me to work for you?

272
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,833
-You want in?
-Yes!

273
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,134
What morons!

274
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,946
Dad! Don't you worry about me.

275
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,247
I've found my dream here.

276
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,014
Everything's fine.

277
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,351
Okay. Till next time.

278
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,391
-Bye!
-Bye!

279
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,995
It's getting cold. Wrap up warm.

280
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,689
And be careful when you go out.

281
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,858
There are bad people out there.

282
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,292
You here for dance lessons too?

283
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,503
You're a man.
What's with the earring?

284
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,484
What kind of a man
wouldn't lift a finger?

285
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:40,766
No help with the coins.
You're not a gentleman.

286
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,343
Thanks.

287
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,338
Boss!

288
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,211
Excuse me, where--?

289
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,376
It's the back door
for the cleaning job.

290
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,579
Don't bother us.

291
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,590
Cleaning job?

292
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,520
What? You're cleaning toilets?

293
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,259
I'll be in charge of everything,
including toilets.

294
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,329
Same thing.

295
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,937
Right! You're cleaning
other people's toilets...

296
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,267
...for only $400 a month.

297
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,708
I can learn to dance
and still have $400 clear.

298
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,371
You have a day job.
You clean toilets at night.

299
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,416
And pick up dance steps along
the way. You'll break your back.

300
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,246
I don't have a problem with that.

301
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:33,185
Aren't you worried what the fat lady
foreman will do if she finds out?

302
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,359
I used to sneak in before.

303
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,395
I don't care! I want to dance.
I want to jump up and touch the stars!

304
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,750
Are you nuts?

305
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,519
Is this for an octopus?

306
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:16,125
Five, six, seven, eight. One....

307
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,937
Left.

308
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,951
How long have you been
learning to dance?

309
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,249
Not now! I'm in a hurry.

310
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,693
No problem!

311
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:56,297
Look! It's the boss again.

312
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:59,696
He's got a nice face, hasn't he?

313
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,429
That's not the point.

314
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,198
He's only 28...

315
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,343
...and he's already in the
"1 00 Most lnfluential" list.

316
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,279
You shouldn't judge people
by their looks.

317
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:14,475
Good looks are just as important
as power.

318
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,779
He's never even glanced at you.

319
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,814
And he's a terrible playboy.

320
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,583
I don't like that about him.

321
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:24,057
I don't like that about him either.

322
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,894
You should watch out.
He might fall for you!

323
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,898
So what?

324
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,561
I'm only a cleaning lady, but if a man
doesn't love me with all his heart...

325
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,436
...then don't bother, even if you're
Tom Cruise. Not to mention him.

326
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,211
It's rare to find a girl of principles.

327
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,507
You'd have a better chance
if you lost the hair on your upper lip.

328
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,047
What?

329
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,093
What are you laughing at?

330
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,925
She thinks one of the most influential
men in the country would fall for her.

331
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,905
Let's call it a day.

332
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,676
Go home and practice
to the music, okay?

333
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,758
What are you doing?
Don't touch my stuff!

334
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,659
I didn't mean to. I have the same thing
back home, exactly the same as yours.

335
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:37,528
This is worth over $1 000.
Do you have that in your village?

336
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:40,637
Wow, a thousand dollars?

337
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,796
Then you got ripped off. Really!

338
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,903
Forget it! Don't mind her.

339
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,943
She's just a peasant.
What does she know?

340
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,137
You got ripped off.

341
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:54,982
Excuse me. I'm in a hurry.

342
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,389
Dad, I haven't talked to you
in a while.

343
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,050
I have a wonderful thing to tell you.

344
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:09,063
I've found a job,
cleaning toilets in a dance school.

345
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,268
And I've taped a very popular song
from school for you.

346
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,171
We'll see about that.

347
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,594
It's only the cleaning lady. Let's go.

348
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,032
Hey! It's time to go.

349
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,071
Hey! It's time to go.

350
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,478
Boss!

351
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:50,088
Awesome! I never knew there were so
many beautiful girls in your company!

352
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,729
Which one do you think
is the most beautiful?

353
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,593
The one in red.

354
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:58,963
I think the one in yellow
is more beautiful.

355
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,330
I think so too.

356
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,870
What do you think, Ron?

357
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,566
-Go on.
-Tell us, Ron.

358
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,234
Which one?

359
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,147
If I really had to choose,
I'd say the one in gray.

360
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,074
Gray?

361
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,186
No one's wearing gray.

362
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,116
The one mopping the floor
is in gray.

363
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,623
But she's only the cleaner.

364
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,587
Well, you did ask me.
Can't a cleaning lady be beautiful?

365
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,946
Look! A peasant girl dancing.

366
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,092
You look so silly!

367
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,395
Where are you going? Come back.

368
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,195
Where are you going?

369
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,928
Dance!

370
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,413
Where have you been?

371
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,275
At dance class.

372
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:44,628
Kids with dreams,
they're a dime a dozen.

373
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:49,098
You should face reality.
You're in no position to dream.

374
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,367
You won't compromise,
you have no money...

375
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,306
...and you're not pretty.

376
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,345
You don't even
do your factory job well.

377
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,279
You peasant girls don't know crap.

378
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:05,081
You need to be practical and
work hard when you come to the city.

379
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:07,986
Dreaming won't put food
on the table.

380
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:20,361
Reality is tough.
Think about what I'm saying.

381
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,474
It's a jungle out there. Take this.

382
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:36,438
You peasant girls don't know crap.

383
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,516
You need to be practical and
work hard when you come to the city.

384
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,881
Dreaming won't put food
on the table.

385
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,695
How are you?

386
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,365
Is this why you're always rushing?

387
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,871
Because you come over here
to dance every day?

388
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,771
That's right.

389
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,606
I haven't seen you dance lately.

390
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,374
You dance well.

391
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,021
I have to go now.

392
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,887
Not everyone has the talent
to dance.

393
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,266
I know I'm not gifted...

394
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,065
...but I love to dance so much
that I just carry on.

395
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,067
You have what it takes.
Don't give up!

396
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,785
Coming!

397
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,645
May l?

398
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,508
Come!

399
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,616
Dad, something bad
happened recently.

400
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,315
It almost made me give up
my dream.

401
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,825
It's so easy to give up.

402
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,158
Having the courage
to carry on is harder.

403
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,199
But I know now what I should do.

404
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,462
Nothing is impossible,
as long as I believe in myself.

405
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:25,301
Dad, I'm not a child anymore.

406
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,239
I'll work hard and do my job well.

407
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:32,348
And I'll fight for my dream.
Talk later.

408
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,817
Phoenix

409
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,661
Thank you!

410
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:17,984
FREESTYLE WORLD
CHAMPlONSHlP BATTLE

411
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,502
What are you doing?

412
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,337
-I didn't do it on purpose!
-Really?

413
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,138
This isn't the first time
I've seen you dancing here.

414
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,338
-I didn't.
-Yes, you did!

415
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,710
-I didn't.
-You did too!

416
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,580
Do you know how much we pay
each month to come here?

417
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,120
You want to dance?
Well, go on! Dance.

418
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,723
Dance!

419
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,552
Come see the village girl dance!

420
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,557
Dance!

421
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:57,064
Dance, village girl!

422
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,640
What's going on?

423
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,852
You people go back upstairs!

424
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,256
The rest of you continue rehearsing!

425
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,127
You are a cleaner.

426
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,031
From now on don't do anything
except cleaning.

427
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,186
You should have been
concentrating on your duties.

428
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,380
I--

429
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,956
Let me finish.

430
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,160
I have to let you go.

431
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,660
-lt wasn't like that--
-But you can take dance class here.

432
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,721
I'll bring Mr. Li up to speed.

433
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:26,239
I have no money.

434
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,408
All fees are exempted.

435
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,581
And the school will give you
an allowance as well.

436
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,848
That's too kind of you!

437
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,357
I don't know how to thank you.
Can I buy you dinner?

438
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,160
You don't have to do that.
You're a natural. Work hard!

439
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:45,165
I'm so grateful. You don't know
how much I love dancing.

440
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,327
-Let me buy you dinner tonight.
-Maybe some other time.

441
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,798
I'm not the type of girl
who has dinner with just anybody.

442
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:53,943
But I really don't know how
to thank you.

443
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,542
Some other time.

444
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,103
So you're not coming?

445
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,939
Then I'll go.

446
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,211
-Hey!
-Yes?

447
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:41,548
Do you have heels?

448
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,965
Mr. Chan.

449
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,932
This lady and I are going out tonight.
Would you please...?

450
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,969
No problem. Come with me.

451
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,974
Your friend is all set, Mr. Chan.

452
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,533
I've never worn backless before.

453
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,836
You look really beautiful.

454
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,102
-Really?
-Sure!

455
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,769
You have potential.
I have faith in you.

456
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,415
Let me enroll you now, miss.

457
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,609
-Give me 500 bucks and I'll--
-Bonkers.

458
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,146
I'll....

459
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:20,980
Here's your money.

460
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:27,119
That's it. You suckers never
pay back what you borrowed.

461
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,503
Your table is ready, Mr. Chan.

462
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:43,407
This way, please.

463
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,860
Have you got a menu with pictures?

464
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:09,966
Why don't you let me order for you?

465
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,301
-ls there anything you don't eat?
-No.

466
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:15,142
Two lobster bisques.

467
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,042
Two sirloin steaks.
Both medium rare.

468
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,076
That's all.

469
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,126
You must be a very good dancer
to own a dance school.

470
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,195
I don't dance.

471
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:35,325
Then why the school?

472
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,998
These days the young
spend more than adults.

473
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,535
So I plan to reach out to them
with dance.

474
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,705
Then they'll buy my other products.

475
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,364
I'm a businessman.

476
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,875
Why do you want to make
all that money?

477
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,672
There would be no quality of life
without money.

478
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:54,544
Wine, sports car, nice house.
They all cost a lot.

479
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:58,486
Tell me how important you think
it is to make money.

480
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,018
When was the happiest day
of your life?

481
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,718
The day when
my company got listed.

482
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:10,896
That is to say, the day my assets
became worth five times as much.

483
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:16,330
The happiest day of my life
was one summer.

484
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:18,531
I went to work in the fields
with my father.

485
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,371
The sun was shining down on us.
And suddenly there was a shower.

486
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,173
And after the shower,
a huge rainbow in the sky.

487
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:28,247
It was so beautiful.

488
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,582
I don't understand
your kind of happiness.

489
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,785
Maybe it's because
I don't have any money.

490
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:43,126
But I believe that the best things in life
don't cost a thing.

491
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,104
I almost forgot.

492
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:51,637
I see you like earrings...

493
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,939
...so I picked these out for you.

494
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,412
Thank you.

495
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,516
I have to go to the washroom.

496
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,766
The sun is coming out!

497
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,707
The lyre is tuned!

498
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:33,550
Hey ho, hey ho, hey ho, hey ho

499
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,248
Here I am.

500
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:50,826
Sometimes the best things in life
can't be bought.

501
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:56,425
I didn't understand that,
but now I do.

502
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,238
Wait.

503
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,335
Look me in the eyes.

504
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,968
And?

505
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,035
Nothing!

506
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,306
Phoenix, you're so lucky!
Don't you forget us!

507
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:51,485
Don't say I didn't warn you.
You're blinded by that cute-looking guy.

508
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:53,485
You'd better watch yourself!

509
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,020
He can tell me lies...

510
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:59,753
...but his eyes can't fool me.

511
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,098
Put me on the line with Samuel.

512
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,308
Hi, Samuel.
The boss wants to talk to you.

513
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,343
-Samuel
-Boss.

514
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,279
I want Phoenix in the school team
for the competition.

515
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,513
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Hear me out.

516
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:30,648
First, I've seen Phoenix dance.
She really is talented.

517
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,418
Second, I'm also running
a business here...

518
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,925
...and the success of a business
depends on publicity.

519
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,663
A peasant girl making it big....

520
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,630
Shanghai would really become
the City of Dreams.

521
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,167
Do you get the gist?

522
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,500
I do.

523
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,946
Dad! I haven't talked to you
for quite a while.

524
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:58,679
Let me tell you a terrific thing
that happened to me.

525
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:02,288
I'm going to participate
in a dance competition!

526
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,620
I don't know how it'll turn out...

527
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,093
...but I think street dance
comes from the heart.

528
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:12,496
It's very instinctive and impromptu.
Just like singing in the fields.

529
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,661
So it's not like the routine kung fu
you taught me...

530
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,999
... that couldn't even catch a fly!

531
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,381
You are now facing
your greatest challenge ever.

532
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,849
As you know, they've been world
champions for three years in a row.

533
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,855
You're coming from behind.

534
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,084
Now you have the chance
to challenge them.

535
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,758
I don't expect you to win.

536
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,300
But I expect you
to do your very best.

537
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:47,860
Failing doesn't matter.

538
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,829
What matters is that you've tried!

539
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,326
This is for you.

540
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,029
Thanks!

541
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,427
How long do you think Phoenix
and the boss will last?

542
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:34,465
Gold digger!
I've seen plenty like her.

543
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,669
They all wind up the same.

544
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,475
Right! The prettiest ones last
three to four months max.

545
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,380
Peasant girl, two months tops.

546
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,984
Oh, poor peasant girl!

547
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:51,285
-Let's go shopping after work.
-Fine.

548
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,860
-Any stores on sale?
-No idea.

549
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,413
This is such a classy place.
Can you afford it?

550
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,449
Don't worry! We've got Ron.

551
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,486
-Mr. Chan.
-Here he is!

552
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:26,358
-Sorry to be so late.
-You're not that late.

553
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,894
Hi! My name is Snow.

554
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,628
Hello!

555
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,493
Something's come up.
I won't be able to dine with you.

556
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,905
Enjoy your dinner.
I've put it on my tab.

557
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,712
Snow, let's order!

558
01:04:49,085 --> 01:04:52,543
Do you think he really loves you?

559
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,158
He's always so busy.

560
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,815
Really?

561
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,393
Why would I lie to you?

562
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,523
That's not what I meant.

563
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,722
I'm afraid you might
be lying to yourself!

564
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:09,201
He's so good-looking and rich.

565
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,465
How could he not be a playboy?

566
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,906
And how could you get so lucky?

567
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,972
Let's order.

568
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,417
Five, six, seven, eight.

569
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,755
Five, six, seven, eight.

570
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:39,963
Stop!

571
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:53,543
I don't care what kind of problems
you've got. You're part of a team.

572
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,480
Make one mistake,
and the whole group tumbles with you.

573
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,716
This competition
is very important for us.

574
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,323
I won't hesitate to kick you out
if you fall behind!

575
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:04,921
Let's carry on.

576
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,395
We'll start from the top.

577
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,904
I understand. But hear me out.

578
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,949
Phoenix is a peasant who doesn't
know shit. She has nothing.

579
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,348
But if she could dance her way
onto the stage...

580
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,318
...isn't that the stuff of Cinderella?

581
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,324
That's the point. Nothing sells
better than this. Let's do it.

582
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,902
You heard what I just said?

583
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,209
Silly girl. It's just publicity.
Don't make too much of it.

584
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:04,179
Are you seeing someone else?

585
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,082
What are you saying?

586
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:15,862
Hello? Okay, I'm on my way.

587
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,265
I've got to rush. I'll call you later.

588
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,530
Snow! Where's Phoenix?
I can't find her.

589
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,067
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

590
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,472
-Are you all right?
-What have you done to her?

591
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,469
-What's happened to Phoenix?
-She's disappeared!

592
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,773
What?

593
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:16,440
I told her it was too good to be true.
But she wouldn't listen!

594
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:17,745
It's all your fault!

595
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,410
Horny bastard!

596
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,185
-Slut!
-What?

597
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:45,763
Besides your first kiss,
was there anything else?

598
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,877
What are you talking about?

599
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:52,408
What I meant was...

600
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:56,608
...after the kiss,
did you do anything with him?

601
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:58,744
Nothing--

602
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,651
Nothing left? He's a dead man!

603
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,486
Let go of me! He's a dead man!

604
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,128
I was trying to say
nothing has happened!

605
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,795
But there goes my first love.

606
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:22,843
Your old man understands.
But that's life!

607
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:28,745
There was a time,
when you first learned to walk.

608
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,714
Your first word.

609
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,786
The first time
you worked in the fields.

610
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:36,220
There are so many first times
in our lives...

611
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,986
...but we forget them very soon...

612
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,264
...whether they're happy
or sad memories.

613
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:46,595
They're gone, gone like the wind.

614
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,176
But it still hurts!

615
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,522
Dad! Don't you worry about me.

616
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,191
I've found my dream here!

617
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:21,768
Everything's fine!

618
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,997
Okay. Till next time. Bye!

619
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,041
Dad, I haven't talked to you
in a while.

620
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,906
I have a wonderful thing to tell you.

621
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:35,911
I've found a job,
cleaning toilets in a dance school.

622
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,578
Dad, something bad
happened recently.

623
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,657
It almost made me give up
my dream.

624
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,724
It's so easy to give up.

625
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:50,058
Having the courage
to carry on is harder.

626
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:52,261
But I know now what I should do.

627
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,232
Nothing is impossible
as long as I believe in myself.

628
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:38,974
Okay! It's nearly time.

629
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,396
-There's Phoenix!
-Really?

630
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,265
-That's not her!
-Where?

631
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,215
It hurts.

632
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,801
Qian, you stand in for her.

633
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,931
Why not let Cindy take her place?

634
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,705
You go!

635
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,103
No, you.

636
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,802
Me? Yes!

637
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,859
Are you a man or a woman?

638
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,263
It takes all kinds.

639
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,370
I'm just a bit special.
What's wrong with that?

640
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,794
Phoenix! It's Phoenix!

641
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:40,201
Yo! What's with the outfit?
I bet she's your daughter!

642
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:57,156
Dancing and kung fu
walk hand-in-hand.

643
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,759
They come from the same place.

644
01:21:28,984 --> 01:21:30,975
Yeah! Yeah!

645
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,333
What are you doing here?

646
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,878
Phoenix! You were great!

647
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,217
Thanks.

648
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:08,186
I never had the chance to introduce
myself. I'm May. Ron's sister.

649
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,122
That was me the other day.
I called Ron from the airport.

650
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:14,956
I wanted to surprise him.

651
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,257
Didn't realize it'd cause a problem.

652
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,427
My brother really loves you.

653
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:22,126
He's been upstairs
cheering you on all night.

654
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,686
Look into my eyes.
