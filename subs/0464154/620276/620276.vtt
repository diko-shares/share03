00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.225
Oh... boy...

2
00:01:54.225 --> 00:01:55.810
That's a fast fish.

3
00:01:56.352 --> 00:01:58.771
C'mon... C'mon! C'mon!

4
00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:00.523
Look at that!

5
00:02:01.107 --> 00:02:02.734
Son of a bitch!

6
00:03:58.057 --> 00:03:59.100
Help...!

7
00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:01.186
Help me...!

8
00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:24.292
PIRANHA

9
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.925
Officer! It was a mistake.

10
00:06:36.925 --> 00:06:38.051
Can't we work something out here?

11
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:40.678
No! Mistake or no mistake.
you just destroyed public property.

12
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.096
And from the smell of your breath!

13
00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:43.556
I suggest you take the ticket.

14
00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:44.891
Maybe get a ride home with your friends.

15
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:47.519
Oh, I don't know, I was kinda
hoping you might drive me home.

16
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.480
Touching a officer's uniform is consider assault?

17
00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:51.814
Are you aware of that?

18
00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:52.757
C'mon...

19
00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:54.234
You look pretty hot in a tan.

20
00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:58.279
It's not tan...

21
00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.322
It's beige.

22
00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.575
Hey, you think you can take it easy on us?

23
00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:04.118
You boys take one more step!

24
00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:05.954
You'll be pissing lightning bolts into next week.

25
00:07:05.995 --> 00:07:07.038
Okay!

26
00:07:23.847 --> 00:07:26.099
Yeah! Pretty much your everyday in college.

27
00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.225
Kelly! Hey! Hmm...

28
00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:28.893
I wasn't sure you were coming back...

29
00:07:29.394 --> 00:07:31.145
for spring break.

30
00:07:31.145 --> 00:07:32.272
Yeah! I'm... I'm here.

31
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.943
I can only assume you're here to
get on one of those boats.

32
00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:38.111
No, no...

33
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.239
I came down here to pick up
my little sister for music lessons.

34
00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:42.323
How bout yourself?

35
00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:44.409
I'm just waiting for my ride.

36
00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.495
Todd and his friends... We're gonna
go check out some music.

37
00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:48.663
Todd Dupree?

38
00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:51.374
Remind me who you going out with again?

39
00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:54.502
Guy have standards alright!
That's all I'm saying.

40
00:07:55.336 --> 00:07:57.714
Look! Todd's a really good DJ.

41
00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:02.218
Kelly!

42
00:08:02.218 --> 00:08:03.636
Let's go! Jump in, we're late!

43
00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:08.333
Listen! He says he's got backstage passes for "Planners".

44
00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:09.142
You should come.

45
00:08:09.976 --> 00:08:10.810
Yeah I would...

46
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.563
But I'm pretty much under house arrest
watching Zana and Laura...

47
00:08:13.563 --> 00:08:14.063
Then too bad.

48
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:16.858
I'll miss ya.

49
00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:18.610
Anyway look! I'd gotta go.

50
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.527
C'mon! Let's go!

51
00:08:19.527 --> 00:08:23.239
Yeah, yeah and hopefully I'll see
you again before you...

52
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:24.574
or you'll leave...

53
00:08:24.824 --> 00:08:26.576
Gonna make a move, Jake.

54
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.996
Hey! Asswipe!

55
00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:31.498

Thanks

60
00:08:48.306 --> 00:08:49.182
I have a training bra...

61
00:08:49.182 --> 00:08:50.433
but I do not like to wear it.

62
00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:51.559
Cos it itches.

63
00:08:52.143 --> 00:08:53.436
Tell me about it.

64
00:08:55.647 --> 00:08:56.898
Who're you waiting for?

65
00:08:57.148 --> 00:08:58.858
My brother Jake. He's 17.

66
00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:00.819
He'll like your boobs too.

67
00:09:00.819 --> 00:09:01.820
They all do.

68
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.946
C'mon Laura, let's go.

69
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:04.364
What happened to you?

70
00:09:04.614 --> 00:09:06.574
Look. I don't want to talk
about it okay. Let's go.

71
00:09:06.783 --> 00:09:07.826
Hi Jake!

72
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.537
Try not to stare at her boobs.

73
00:09:10.537 --> 00:09:11.579
Shut up.

74
00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:14.165
I like your shirt.

75
00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:16.042
Why? You want to throw something at me too?

76
00:09:16.668 --> 00:09:18.753
No! Actually I like The Pixies.

77
00:09:18.753 --> 00:09:19.754
Danni, Danni...

78
00:09:19.754 --> 00:09:21.422
Where the hell is Crystal?

79
00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.298
She's over there with Andrew...

80
00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:23.967
They're gettin sunscreen.

81
00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:24.801
We're just waiting.

82
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:25.760
Sunscreen?

83
00:09:26.052 --> 00:09:27.679
Andrew! Crystal! we don't need sunscreen!

84
00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.097
We need body paint! We need condoms!

85
00:09:29.097 --> 00:09:30.098
We need ready whip!

86
00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:31.182

Make sure those tities are nice and perky!

91
00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:41.568
Who's this?

92
00:09:42.277 --> 00:09:43.611
This is Jake.

93
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:44.654
He's a lifeful.

94
00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:46.906
A sandrat huh?

95
00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:48.658
You know your way around the lake?

96
00:09:48.658 --> 00:09:49.242
Aah... Yeah!

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.719
You wanna job? I pay cash money.

103
00:09:58.001 --> 00:09:59.478

105
00:10:01.754 --> 00:10:03.965

115
00:10:19.564 --> 00:10:21.107
He's the director.

00:10:21.691 --> 00:10:23.234
Oh! So you're like a ...

117
00:10:23.234 --> 00:10:24.694

130
00:10:47.592 --> 00:10:49.677
We're talking life lessons here, Jake.

138
00:11:34.714 --> 00:11:37.717
Why you're gonna knock if
you're just gonna walk in?!

139
00:11:37.892 --> 00:11:39.227
Am I disturbing you?

140
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:40.645
No, I'm just...

141
00:11:40.645 --> 00:11:42.230
doing homework and...

142
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.108
and school work and research for school.

143
00:11:46.693 --> 00:11:47.761
Laura!

144
00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:50.430
Have been telling me that you may have
some other plans...

145
00:11:50.488 --> 00:11:51.447
for tomorrow.

146
00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:53.283
No! What's she talking about...

147
00:11:53.283 --> 00:11:54.434
I'm a 100% baby sitting.

148
00:11:54.492 --> 00:11:57.412
What? No, no... we don't want a babysitter!

149
00:11:57.495 --> 00:11:59.122
Yeah mom! Especially not Jake.

150
00:11:59.914 --> 00:12:00.957
Please...
- especially not Jake...

151
00:12:00.957 --> 00:12:01.791
I'm serious.

152
00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.002
No! We don't need one now!
- Get out, out, out!

153
00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:04.836
Out...

154
00:12:06.171 --> 00:12:07.881
Mom! C'mon... Please! We have to talk about this...

155
00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:08.673
Mom...

156
00:12:08.673 --> 00:12:11.217
Jake, you know I do not have a backup.

157
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.803
Yeah I know mom.

158
00:12:13.803 --> 00:12:16.139
Yeah don't worry. I know how
crazy this week is for you.

159
00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:17.223
And...

160
00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:19.434
I'll take care of the nitwits, okay.

161
00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:22.061
Remember, if you do not fulfill your responsiblity...

162
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:23.714
I have the power to arrest and...

163
00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:25.123
and imprison you.

164
00:12:25.482 --> 00:12:27.066
Mom, I'm not 12 okay.

165
00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:28.894
playing the sheriff card isn't gonna work anymore.

166
00:12:28.902 --> 00:12:31.321
No?
- No.

167
00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:34.282
Like I said, I'll take care of it okay?

168
00:12:34.908 --> 00:12:36.242
Alright.

169
00:12:36.576 --> 00:12:37.619
Better.

170
00:12:37.744 --> 00:12:38.953
Get outta here.

171
00:12:38.953 --> 00:12:41.539
Alright... Well next year I'll try to find another solution.

172
00:12:41.664 --> 00:12:42.665
Alright.
- Alright!

173
00:12:42.665 --> 00:12:43.708
Okay.

174
00:12:51.674 --> 00:12:52.884
Oh! And Jake?

175
00:12:52.884 --> 00:12:53.927
Oh mom! C'mon on!

176
00:12:54.886 --> 00:12:55.529
Really!

177
00:12:55.595 --> 00:12:56.387
It's time for dinner.

178
00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:58.681
Alright, alright... I'll be right there.

179
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.544
I hope I didn't wake the kids.

180
00:13:27.836 --> 00:13:29.387
Oh god! They'll sleep thru anything.

181
00:13:29.462 --> 00:13:32.966
So Maggie said that yesterday was
last time she saw them?

182
00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:34.259
Yeah, just before noon.

183
00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:37.387
She said Matt took the boat out to catch some bass.

184
00:13:37.387 --> 00:13:40.139
She drove around the lake all night looking for him.

185
00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:42.725
Where's the boat?
- Over there.

186
00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:57.407
You feeling like a skinnydip?

187
00:13:57.448 --> 00:13:59.868
Yeah, I think we can make it to the end of the pier.

188
00:13:59.868 --> 00:14:00.535
Meaning what?

189
00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:02.020
I'm too old or I'm too heavy?

190
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.072
I think you're too chickenshit.

191
00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:08.969
By the way, Gordon called last night.

192
00:14:09.043 --> 00:14:09.961
Yeah?

193
00:14:10.086 --> 00:14:14.507
He said the USGS recorded a heavy
seismic activity beneath the lake.

194
00:14:14.632 --> 00:14:15.592
Really?

195
00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:18.678
They're sending in a team of seismologist divers.

196
00:14:18.678 --> 00:14:19.521
Alright!

197
00:14:19.596 --> 00:14:22.599
And he said you will escort them out.

198
00:14:22.932 --> 00:14:25.018
Jesus Christ.

199
00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:26.761
Just been invaded by 20,000 kids...

200
00:14:26.811 --> 00:14:29.230
makes us a little busy at the moment.

201
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.773
You know. That's what I told them.

202
00:14:32.942 --> 00:14:34.777
This doesn't sound too good.

203
00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:52.086
So what time is the divers...

204
00:14:52.086 --> 00:14:53.046
gonna get here?

205
00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:54.380
He said about 10.

206
00:15:13.274 --> 00:15:14.234
Shit.

207
00:15:19.781 --> 00:15:20.949
C'mon just a little more.

208
00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:24.494
Can't get it.

209
00:15:33.336 --> 00:15:34.587
Give me your hand!

210
00:15:42.887 --> 00:15:44.506
You think a propeller could have done it?

211
00:15:44.514 --> 00:15:45.265
I doubt it.

212
00:15:45.265 --> 00:15:47.016
Look at the bones, nothing's broken.

213
00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:49.435
It's like something acidic...

214
00:15:49.435 --> 00:15:50.871
or toxic decomposition.

215
00:15:50.895 --> 00:15:52.897
Well if the body's been in the water for weeks.

216
00:15:55.275 --> 00:15:58.486
What would you say if I was thinking about closing the lake?

217
00:15:59.404 --> 00:16:01.322
You know, just until we get an autopsy report.

218
00:16:01.322 --> 00:16:04.242
The autopsy report is gonna take a couple of days.

219
00:16:04.367 --> 00:16:07.112
It'll be easier to drain this lake then to close it.

220
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.372
It's a big financial week for our town.

221
00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.168
Too old for this.

222
00:17:22.195 --> 00:17:23.279
We're not lying to mom.

223
00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.364
Yeah! We're not lying to mom.

224
00:17:24.364 --> 00:17:25.323
Come on guys...

225
00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:26.574
every year it's the same thing.

226
00:17:26.574 --> 00:17:27.617
I'm stuck here with you guys while...

227
00:17:27.617 --> 00:17:29.869
I miss all spring break fun.

228
00:17:29.869 --> 00:17:31.996
You mean spring break boobies?

229
00:17:32.705 --> 00:17:33.957
What if I give you guys the cash for babysitting?

230
00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:36.042
Sixty dollars and you got a deal.

231
00:17:36.042 --> 00:17:37.219
Sixty! I'm only getting paid forty!

232
00:17:37.252 --> 00:17:40.129
Twenty dollars deception surcharge.

233
00:17:46.094 --> 00:17:47.178
Do not pickup the phone.

234
00:17:47.387 --> 00:17:48.179
Do not answer the door.

235
00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:51.224
And do not leave the house.

236
00:17:51.683 --> 00:17:52.726
Okay? I'm counting on you guys.

237
00:17:52.809 --> 00:17:53.852
Alright?

238
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:25.884
Hi!

239
00:18:26.843 --> 00:18:27.760
After the dive.

240
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.679
Our presence is requested at the Kokamo's.

241
00:18:29.679 --> 00:18:31.514
By the Arizona State Cheerleading team.

242
00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:32.649
Hi! I'm Sherffi Forester.

243
00:18:32.682 --> 00:18:35.310
Bob Gordon asked me to take you out to the site.

244
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.060
Very good to meet you.

245
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.854
I love the welcoming committee around here.

246
00:18:37.854 --> 00:18:39.772
I assume that's technical equipment too?

247
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.066
Yes, Sam! Give those back.
C'mon.

248
00:18:43.193 --> 00:18:44.944
According to the epicentre coordinates...

249
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:47.989
we need to go... here.

250
00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:50.575
Okay.

251
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.994
It's about 20 minutes out.

252
00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:54.162
Ready when you are.

253
00:18:54.162 --> 00:18:55.205
Alright.

254
00:18:57.874 --> 00:19:01.544
So you don't see many women working law
enforcement out here in cowboy country.

255
00:19:01.628 --> 00:19:02.879
You see a lot of cowboys though.

256
00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:04.339
Yeah, Sure.

257
00:20:40.768 --> 00:20:41.394
Kelly!

258
00:20:41.394 --> 00:20:42.020
Jake!

259
00:20:44.314 --> 00:20:46.524
Who exactly are you babysitting here?

260
00:20:47.066 --> 00:20:48.693
Well, it's a ...

261
00:20:48.985 --> 00:20:50.361
It's a funny story actually, I...

262
00:20:50.361 --> 00:20:51.404
I say tit!

263
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:52.572
You say eat!

264
00:20:52.572 --> 00:20:54.032
Tit!
- Eat tit!

265
00:20:56.784 --> 00:20:57.569
Look at those idiots.

266
00:20:57.577 --> 00:20:59.412
It's a... terrible.

267
00:21:00.163 --> 00:21:01.206
Sandrat!

268
00:21:01.873 --> 00:21:02.816
Hey! Sandrat!

269
00:21:02.832 --> 00:21:03.875
I'm talking to you.

270
00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:04.918
SANDRAT!

271
00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:05.260
Hello!

272
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.503
Where the hell have you been?

273
00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:06.845
We got these girls souped up.

274
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.463
We're ready to roll!

275
00:21:08.463 --> 00:21:09.356
I'm docking your paycheck!

276
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.965
C'mon! Let's go.

277
00:21:10.965 --> 00:21:12.008
Okay!

278
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.722
Now I see what you've been
scouting in the last 15 minutes.

279
00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:21.434
Well! Kelly it's nice to see you.
I know you gonna get going.

280
00:21:21.434 --> 00:21:22.268
Kelly! Kelly.

281
00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:24.062
Hi! I'm Derrick Jones.

282
00:21:24.062 --> 00:21:25.104
Hi!

283
00:21:26.022 --> 00:21:27.065
You know this guy?

284
00:21:28.233 --> 00:21:28.608
Jake!

285
00:21:28.608 --> 00:21:30.577
"Jake is my boy"!

286
00:21:30.652 --> 00:21:31.903
Jake is the man with the plan!

287
00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:33.346
The inside, the knowledge!

288
00:21:33.404 --> 00:21:34.656
Yeah wait!

289
00:21:35.156 --> 00:21:37.534
Those girls aren't with you,
are they?

290
00:21:37.659 --> 00:21:40.537
Yeah! why? Are you into girls?

291
00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:42.664
No, I'm just showing him around town...

292
00:21:42.664 --> 00:21:44.332
ya know just all the hot spots.

293
00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:45.375
Jake, jake, jake...

294
00:21:45.375 --> 00:21:47.585
The job is called location scout and...

295
00:21:47.585 --> 00:21:49.420
Kelly you should come with!

296
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:52.006
Today we're gonna be making movie history.

297
00:21:52.757 --> 00:21:54.467
No! She's got other plans already.

298
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.678
Kelly do you like champagne?

299
00:22:01.057 --> 00:22:03.226
I... I love champagne,

300
00:22:03.226 --> 00:22:04.227
actually I love...

301
00:22:04.227 --> 00:22:05.111
No, no, no! Wait a second!

302
00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:08.231
I would love come on your boat Derrick,
thank you.

303
00:22:08.231 --> 00:22:08.982
I mean...

304
00:22:08.982 --> 00:22:10.900
Someone have to keep an eye
on the man with the plan here.

305
00:22:11.151 --> 00:22:12.193
Right! Sand RAT!

306
00:22:12.193 --> 00:22:13.236
C'mon, c'mon...

307
00:22:13.236 --> 00:22:15.155
Let me... let me help you aboard.

308
00:22:15.822 --> 00:22:16.447
Why! Why...

309
00:22:16.447 --> 00:22:19.117
Hey! Todd, That's Kelly.

310
00:22:20.285 --> 00:22:22.203
Hi Kelly! baby.

311
00:22:23.997 --> 00:22:24.789
What happened to...

312
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:26.166
ya know hanging with us today?

313
00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:27.917
Is that your boyfriend or something?
- No, no, no

314
00:22:27.917 --> 00:22:29.210
He's just some guy from the school,

315
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.005
someone whom he said to have
backstage passes when he actually doesn't.

316
00:22:32.005 --> 00:22:34.299
Have a good day Todd!
- C'mon Kelly!

317
00:22:34.465 --> 00:22:35.800
Go on, have a T-shirt.

318
00:22:39.637 --> 00:22:40.680
What the fuck?!

319
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.431
That's Derrick Jones...

320
00:22:41.431 --> 00:22:43.391
Is it Jake Forrester?

321
00:22:45.143 --> 00:22:46.102
Oh... fuck me...

322
00:22:46.102 --> 00:22:48.646
Alright! We are off to shoot some wild porn...

323
00:22:48.646 --> 00:22:53.151
royal like with these "Wild Wild Goddesses" !!

324
00:22:55.403 --> 00:22:56.529
But we will see you all...

325
00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:59.991
4 o'clock Canyon Beach for the Lake Victoria wet t-shirt...

326
00:22:59.991 --> 00:23:03.870
"Wild Extravaganza"!!

327
00:23:04.454 --> 00:23:06.247
We told Dave we would stay in the house.

328
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.957
We told Jack that we'll stay home.

329
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:10.502
I told him I'd fish.

330
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.587
I can't if there aren't any.

331
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:13.963
The lake too busy!.

332
00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:16.049
C'mon! Sand Island is really close.

333
00:23:28.478 --> 00:23:30.021
I should've brought my trombone.

334
00:23:30.396 --> 00:23:34.234
No way! Girl! Sunbath or something.

335
00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:36.402
Well when I become a rock star...

336
00:23:36.402 --> 00:23:39.072
see if I like you be in one of my groupies.

337
00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:41.449
Give me a break dude!

338
00:23:41.783 --> 00:23:44.118
You PLAY the trombone!

339
00:23:55.922 --> 00:23:56.673
Alright ladies here we go...

340
00:23:56.673 --> 00:23:59.050
a little bubbly!
- Thank you.

341
00:23:59.050 --> 00:23:59.801
Here you go!

342
00:24:00.093 --> 00:24:02.971
Finest's your... Shinaz has to offer.

343
00:24:02.971 --> 00:24:03.888
You're kidding.

344
00:24:03.888 --> 00:24:07.058
Here we go... yeah!

345
00:24:07.058 --> 00:24:08.101
Drink up. Crystal.

346
00:24:08.101 --> 00:24:11.020
Yeah!
Join and cheers!

347
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:11.938
Cheers!

348
00:24:11.938 --> 00:24:14.149
To our newest ''Wild Wild" Number.

349
00:24:15.775 --> 00:24:17.443
You are beautiful.

350
00:24:17.735 --> 00:24:20.363
That's why we came here.
Derrick wants to capture innocence.

351
00:24:20.822 --> 00:24:22.365
It's all about innocence.

352
00:24:22.574 --> 00:24:24.117
Just like her.

353
00:24:30.206 --> 00:24:31.916
Alright! Derrick's just making his play.

354
00:24:32.417 --> 00:24:34.335
He might as well ask me out to breathe.

355
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:38.089
Show a girl a camera and she WILL perform.

356
00:24:38.214 --> 00:24:39.841
It's like a law of physics.

357
00:24:40.133 --> 00:24:41.843
I've seen that guy charm the pants off a lot of ladies.

358
00:24:43.595 --> 00:24:45.180
She's not messing up your party! Is she?

359
00:24:46.014 --> 00:24:47.265
Like I care. She's not my girlfriend.

360
00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.308
Oh! And...

361
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.060
I'm.. This is great. I'm having a great time...

362
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.803
We're... going wild...

363
00:24:51.853 --> 00:24:55.064
I'm... going wild.

364
00:24:55.315 --> 00:24:57.066
Hey, Jake! How far is this place?!

365
00:24:57.066 --> 00:24:58.276
C'mon!

366
00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:00.111
Yeah, yeah we're almost there!

367
00:25:02.155 --> 00:25:04.073
So speaking of going wild?

368
00:25:05.074 --> 00:25:07.410
You haven't seen anything yet.

369
00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:30.642
Jake!

370
00:25:31.643 --> 00:25:32.685
Jake.

371
00:25:32.685 --> 00:25:33.728
Yeah?

372
00:25:37.232 --> 00:25:38.274
Jake!

373
00:25:44.989 --> 00:25:47.283
Why don't you put it somewhere...

374
00:25:47.283 --> 00:25:49.202
Anyway you want.

375
00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:54.082
Crystal! He's not even legal.

376
00:26:55.226 --> 00:26:55.894
Hey, what's up guys?

377
00:26:55.894 --> 00:26:58.104
Jake! Close that door! You're ruining our shot!

378
00:26:58.563 --> 00:27:01.441
C'mon sandrat! Get with the program here.

379
00:27:01.816 --> 00:27:02.859
Here they come, here they come!

380
00:27:02.859 --> 00:27:04.611
Here come's my nymphs.

381
00:27:06.863 --> 00:27:08.198
Oh my god!

382
00:27:09.491 --> 00:27:10.533
Here we go!

383
00:27:11.117 --> 00:27:13.495
Check it out!
The fish with boobies.

384
00:27:14.829 --> 00:27:16.331
If fish looked like that! I would fuck fish!

385
00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:18.249
I would only fuck fish!

386
00:27:18.875 --> 00:27:19.918
Here we go...

387
00:27:20.293 --> 00:27:21.586
Looking good ladies.

388
00:27:21.586 --> 00:27:22.921
You like this right? Jake?

389
00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:25.882
You're the one that should be paying us today,
not the other way around.

390
00:27:26.466 --> 00:27:28.593
Zoom in. Zoom, zoom, zoom...

391
00:27:29.677 --> 00:27:30.720
Get that ass.

392
00:27:32.138 --> 00:27:33.765
Look at these Goddess of product...

393
00:27:33.765 --> 00:27:34.974
bitches. This is hot Andy!

394
00:27:35.391 --> 00:27:37.060
This is so hot! This is what it's all about!

395
00:27:37.393 --> 00:27:41.439
Beer, sun and naked honeys making out underwater!

396
00:27:46.569 --> 00:27:49.239
Better than any aquarium YOU been to sandrat!

397
00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:55.119
Uh... mom! Hey! Umm...

398
00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:55.862
Mom?

399
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.580
What... what's going on out over there? Cuz...

400
00:27:58.248 --> 00:27:59.290
Naked fishes!

401
00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:02.001
Well then how come you didn't pickup the home phone?

402
00:28:02.252 --> 00:28:03.753
Ya know! I've been trying to reach you.

403
00:28:04.504 --> 00:28:05.880
Why? I... I...

404
00:28:06.172 --> 00:28:07.298
I'm sorry we've just been outside.

405
00:28:07.298 --> 00:28:10.385
But I... I can get them if you need me to.
- Crystal! spin around!

406
00:28:10.635 --> 00:28:12.303
No, no that's okay.

407
00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:17.142
Oh my god!

408
00:28:17.475 --> 00:28:18.434
What?

409
00:28:20.353 --> 00:28:22.272
Nothing, nothing it's just the...

410
00:28:22.272 --> 00:28:23.982
It just the kids. They're...

411
00:28:24.107 --> 00:28:26.734
Just pushed the tent outside and...

412
00:28:26.734 --> 00:28:27.902
I... I...

413
00:28:29.154 --> 00:28:30.572
It just really nice to see them...

414
00:28:31.281 --> 00:28:32.657
to see them playing with each other.

415
00:28:32.866 --> 00:28:35.201
Put you ass on the glass!

416
00:28:35.201 --> 00:28:35.994
Yeah!

417
00:28:36.119 --> 00:28:36.369
Your...cho...

418
00:28:36.369 --> 00:28:37.412
Choucha!

419
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.330
Jake? Is someone there with you?

420
00:28:40.623 --> 00:28:43.585
No, no, no. It's just the...

421
00:28:43.585 --> 00:28:44.669
It's just the kids on the lake!

422
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:46.379
It's crazy here, you know how it is.

423
00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:49.465
Honey, I do not want to Zane or Laura near the lake today,

424
00:28:49.465 --> 00:28:50.508
Do you hear me?

425
00:28:50.967 --> 00:28:52.677
Alright! Okay. We'll stay in and...

426
00:28:52.677 --> 00:28:55.346
We'll watch some TV. Whatever's on okay!

427
00:28:56.556 --> 00:28:59.184
Alright! I gonna go. Thank you so much for this.

428
00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:01.686
I'll try really hard to be home early, okay?

429
00:29:02.812 --> 00:29:04.022
Yeah. Alright, alright I love you.

430
00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:05.064
Okay I gonna go!

431
00:29:07.358 --> 00:29:08.401
Kelly?

432
00:29:13.448 --> 00:29:15.116
Kelly, where are ya?!

433
00:29:20.914 --> 00:29:22.248
Kelly?

434
00:29:26.377 --> 00:29:27.420
Kelly?

435
00:30:12.382 --> 00:30:14.676
Jake!

436
00:30:14.676 --> 00:30:16.302
You just missed the rest of the big show!

437
00:30:17.178 --> 00:30:19.889
There you go girls! Come on up!
Give 'em some towels!

438
00:30:23.643 --> 00:30:24.769
Wow! Good work!

439
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:25.812
waste time for canoe.

440
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:28.731
I must've gotten my knots mixed up!

441
00:30:28.857 --> 00:30:31.276
So you caught zero fish and you lose our only boat.

442
00:30:31.276 --> 00:30:33.386
This sea is so full of accomplishment!

443
00:30:33.444 --> 00:30:35.363
Jake is gonna kill us.

444
00:30:35.572 --> 00:30:36.739
Somebody will see us.

445
00:30:36.739 --> 00:30:39.033
Look! There's some boats just right over there!

446
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.828
Don't waste your time, they'll never see us.

447
00:30:41.828 --> 00:30:42.871
They're way too far.

448
00:30:45.165 --> 00:30:46.749
Hello!

449
00:30:53.131 --> 00:30:54.632
Hello!

450
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:12.942
We need some help!

451
00:31:13.234 --> 00:31:14.277
Hey!

452
00:31:14.277 --> 00:31:15.820
We're over here!

453
00:31:16.863 --> 00:31:18.531
Somebody please help us!

454
00:32:23.263 --> 00:32:24.347
Look at the size of that!

455
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:26.975
What is it? A... a cavern system?

456
00:32:27.142 --> 00:32:29.185
Looks to me like a subterranean lake.

457
00:32:29.185 --> 00:32:30.520
Probably bigger then the one above.

458
00:32:33.064 --> 00:32:34.357
You see that gap right there?
- Yeah?

459
00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:35.608
Quake open that one up.

460
00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:38.078
Now it's a
connecting passage.

461
00:32:38.111 --> 00:32:39.237
A lake under a lake.

462
00:32:39.237 --> 00:32:39.880
That's right.

463
00:32:39.912 --> 00:32:41.981
Sorry! It's still your jurisdiction.

464
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.367
It's part of an old volcanic ridge all over this area.

465
00:32:45.076 --> 00:32:46.202
That's the beauty of it.

466
00:32:46.661 --> 00:32:48.496
We're gonna be the first ones to explore it.

467
00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:50.248
You got it.

468
00:32:50.248 --> 00:32:52.792
I don't know why you get excited over that crap.

469
00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:55.253
All I ever see is rocks and sand.

470
00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:18.526
You should probably warn them
that it's not pretty down there.

471
00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:21.237
Tourists treat this lake like it's a gabbage can.

472
00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:24.282
How you guys doing?

473
00:33:24.449 --> 00:33:26.576
Sheriff said that  it's a regular treasure trove down there.

474
00:33:27.035 --> 00:33:28.077
So...!

475
00:33:28.828 --> 00:33:30.246
I got debs on these spent bubbles,

476
00:33:30.246 --> 00:33:32.790
bad body sprays and back issues of drugs.

477
00:33:33.291 --> 00:33:35.084
I got debs on home appliances.

478
00:33:35.376 --> 00:33:37.462
I got debs on missing college girls.

479
00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:44.010
Oh my god.

480
00:33:45.386 --> 00:33:47.222
This is the longest one I've ever seen.

481
00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:50.225
Can you keep your mind on the task at hand.

482
00:33:57.482 --> 00:33:59.317
It's at least 100 feet Novak!

483
00:34:05.615 --> 00:34:06.991
Almost full visibility.

484
00:34:07.534 --> 00:34:08.576
Descending fissure!

485
00:34:09.202 --> 00:34:11.496
My PO2 is set at 1. 1.3.

486
00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:14.290
You should see this.

487
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.709
It's unbelievable.

488
00:34:18.753 --> 00:34:19.921
Novak, do you copy?

489
00:34:19.921 --> 00:34:20.964
Yeah! Pretty good.

490
00:34:26.427 --> 00:34:30.306
Okay guys you are about 90 feet to the
entrance of the connecting passage.

491
00:34:34.644 --> 00:34:36.521
Looks like single file time!

492
00:34:36.729 --> 00:34:37.605
I'll go first.

493
00:34:37.605 --> 00:34:39.899
No! I should do the prelim scout.

494
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:41.985
Your fat ass will get us stuck.

495
00:34:42.068 --> 00:34:43.862
Baby! I'm like an eel.

496
00:34:43.862 --> 00:34:44.654
I'm electric eel.

497
00:34:45.446 --> 00:34:46.823
I get into such tight spaces.

498
00:34:46.823 --> 00:34:47.866
It's shocking.

499
00:34:48.908 --> 00:34:50.076
Huh! That's weird?

500
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.288
Here they are... but they're spiltting up.

501
00:34:57.625 --> 00:34:58.251
Guys?

502
00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:02.297
Everything alright? I'm losing you a little bit here.

503
00:35:15.518 --> 00:35:17.187
I'm heading a serious drop in temperature here.

504
00:35:17.187 --> 00:35:18.646
It's at least 30 degrees colder.

505
00:35:19.272 --> 00:35:21.649
You're probably at the mountain near the water lake.

506
00:35:24.277 --> 00:35:25.570
Do you have any visual?

507
00:35:28.031 --> 00:35:30.033
I'm entering the cave.

508
00:35:52.972 --> 00:35:54.724
Jesus!

509
00:35:55.016 --> 00:35:56.810
This thing seems endless.

510
00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:11.374
You gotta see this.

511
00:36:11.407 --> 00:36:12.951
This is incredible.

512
00:37:13.761 --> 00:37:15.930
Sam! What are you seeing down there?

513
00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:19.392
Something bit me!

514
00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:23.938
Oh yeah, right! I thought you always love that kinda stuff.

515
00:37:35.241 --> 00:37:37.744
Sam! Sam!

516
00:37:38.036 --> 00:37:39.078
Sam! Answer me!

517
00:37:39.078 --> 00:37:40.121
SAM!

518
00:37:40.121 --> 00:37:41.164
Sam!

519
00:37:54.636 --> 00:37:55.345
Something's happening.

520
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.222
What? You mean aftershock?
- I don't know...

521
00:37:57.222 --> 00:37:58.264
Give me my flippers.

522
00:38:46.521 --> 00:38:47.939
OH MY GOD!

523
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:17.260
Your body is a temple.

524
00:39:17.302 --> 00:39:20.221
And now it is time to give thanks to the gods.

525
00:39:22.015 --> 00:39:23.766
Andrew, roll camera!

526
00:39:23.892 --> 00:39:24.559
Kelly, you're up! C'mon!

527
00:39:24.559 --> 00:39:26.227
Me! No! no, no...

528
00:39:26.352 --> 00:39:29.022
No, thanks. I think very had to drink too much.

529
00:39:29.022 --> 00:39:30.982
Please! You don't want to worship this beautiful altar?!
- C'mon...

530
00:39:31.024 --> 00:39:33.234
I know you're partial to the champagne,

531
00:39:33.234 --> 00:39:35.653
but believe us you can trust Crystal right?

532
00:39:35.737 --> 00:39:37.822
Hey! C'mon Derrick, she... she said no.

533
00:39:37.822 --> 00:39:38.465
No...

534
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:40.366
She said no thanks...

535
00:39:40.366 --> 00:39:41.242
There's a difference...

536
00:39:41.242 --> 00:39:44.412
She understands gratitude is the right attitude.

537
00:39:44.996 --> 00:39:46.080
Kelly!

538
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:46.915
Trust us!

539
00:39:46.915 --> 00:39:48.550
It... It's never cheating if it's with another chick!

540
00:39:48.666 --> 00:39:50.001
Yeah! C'mon try it!
- C'mon.

541
00:39:50.001 --> 00:39:51.461
Sure!

542
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:52.504
Have fun!

543
00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:55.524
Yeah! Jake! You're not gonna take away the fun now?

544
00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:59.719
Like I said... she's not my girlfriend.

545
00:40:00.887 --> 00:40:03.223
Fine! I'll do it.

546
00:40:03.223 --> 00:40:04.557
Okay!
- Yeah!

547
00:40:04.557 --> 00:40:05.475
Okay!

548
00:40:05.475 --> 00:40:06.218
Here we go!

549
00:40:06.267 --> 00:40:07.977
First, you lick this salt.

550
00:40:07.977 --> 00:40:08.920
Here we go!
- Okay!

551
00:40:08.995 --> 00:40:10.371
C'mon over here!

552
00:40:11.022 --> 00:40:13.149
Then you suck up the tequila.

553
00:40:14.067 --> 00:40:15.902
Here we go! Sorry about that
Crystal!

554
00:40:15.902 --> 00:40:16.945
Here's your vitamin C!

555
00:40:16.945 --> 00:40:18.905
Gonna get your lime!

556
00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:20.949
Kelly! You don't have to do this.

557
00:40:20.949 --> 00:40:23.326
I really don't think I need any
of your babysitting here. Jake!

558
00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:25.870
Rachel!

559
00:40:29.123 --> 00:40:30.625
Okay.

560
00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:31.918
Okay.

561
00:40:42.178 --> 00:40:43.221
Yeah!...

562
00:40:55.984 --> 00:40:57.277
Alright! alright...

563
00:40:57.402 --> 00:40:58.528
Let's switch places!

564
00:40:58.528 --> 00:40:59.571
Good job Kelly!

565
00:40:59.571 --> 00:41:00.029
Jake you're up!

566
00:41:00.029 --> 00:41:01.364
Derrick excuse me! Up a little bit.

567
00:41:01.656 --> 00:41:03.283
How bout we try Jake and Kelly?

568
00:41:03.283 --> 00:41:04.033
What?
- What?

569
00:41:04.033 --> 00:41:05.034
No! I don't think she.
- No! I don't think...

570
00:41:05.034 --> 00:41:06.077
Oh! C'mon Derrick.

571
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.787
C'mon guys, we'll shooting...

572
00:41:07.787 --> 00:41:09.706
porno not a drama. Let's make a decision.

573
00:41:09.706 --> 00:41:10.915
C'mon.

574
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.252
Fuck it! Sandrat...
Let's roll, c'mon!

575
00:41:14.252 --> 00:41:16.045
There you go! Thank you Crystal!

576
00:41:16.462 --> 00:41:18.256
C'mon Kelly. Come on up here.

577
00:41:18.381 --> 00:41:20.425
Come on by the bed!

578
00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:21.467
There we go!

579
00:41:22.343 --> 00:41:24.471
Let's get you some salt!

580
00:41:27.098 --> 00:41:28.808
A little bit of tequila!

581
00:41:29.017 --> 00:41:29.976
Okay!

582
00:41:29.976 --> 00:41:31.019
Yeah!

583
00:41:31.019 --> 00:41:32.979
And... You're live!

584
00:41:33.188 --> 00:41:33.730
Okay! okay!

585
00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:34.564
Roll, roll, roll...

586
00:41:34.564 --> 00:41:35.607
Roll!

587
00:41:43.781 --> 00:41:55.376
Sandrat! Sandrat!...

588
00:42:06.638 --> 00:42:08.389
Mr. Goodman?

589
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:10.433
Mr. Goodman!

590
00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:13.770
I'm coming!

591
00:42:14.521 --> 00:42:16.606
I'm coming, hold your horses!

592
00:42:18.483 --> 00:42:20.568
The store is closed!

593
00:42:28.785 --> 00:42:31.704
I want to know what the hell
this thing is doing in my lake!

594
00:42:33.623 --> 00:42:35.291
Where did you get this?

595
00:42:35.792 --> 00:42:37.085
Oh! In the middle of the lake.

596
00:42:37.544 --> 00:42:39.629
Where they're two people dead!

597
00:42:44.342 --> 00:42:45.385
Oh my...

598
00:42:45.927 --> 00:42:46.761
Oh my! Yeah! That's right...

599
00:42:46.803 --> 00:42:47.887
Oh my, oh my.

600
00:42:47.887 --> 00:42:49.305
Excuse me!

601
00:42:49.472 --> 00:42:50.181
But!

602
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.808
Is that a fucking Piranha?

603
00:42:51.975 --> 00:42:53.685
Carl! Not the only one.

604
00:42:53.685 --> 00:42:54.644
Yeah! here, here, here, look at these...

605
00:42:54.644 --> 00:42:55.687
There are thousands of them.

606
00:42:56.354 --> 00:42:58.014
Thousands! And they're pissed.

607
00:42:58.039 --> 00:42:59.724
You know I have heard of these happening.

608
00:42:59.774 --> 00:43:02.527
It's like those alligators in New Jersey,

609
00:43:02.527 --> 00:43:04.612
Someone leaves them and then they breed!

610
00:43:04.612 --> 00:43:05.989
What?
- No...!

611
00:43:06.573 --> 00:43:08.825
Who release this fish into the lake...

612
00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:10.743
What are you talking about?

613
00:43:11.202 --> 00:43:12.004
THIS!

614
00:43:12.078 --> 00:43:13.997
Particular piranha,

615
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:16.124
Vanished! Off the face of the earth!

616
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:19.752
More than two million years ago!

617
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:23.882
Emm... Where's he going?

618
00:43:29.345 --> 00:43:30.472
Allow me...

619
00:43:31.139 --> 00:43:33.308
to introduce...

620
00:43:37.061 --> 00:43:39.856
The "Pygocentrus Nattereri"

621
00:43:39.856 --> 00:43:42.108
The regional Piranha!

622
00:43:43.234 --> 00:43:45.695
They used to swim the entire Colorado river.

623
00:43:46.529 --> 00:43:49.657
Right until the Piscusus epic .

624
00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:53.703
I still don't understand how you found one.

625
00:43:56.498 --> 00:43:57.540
Alive!

626
00:43:57.957 --> 00:44:00.585
We discovered a subterreanean lake through a rift,

627
00:44:00.585 --> 00:44:02.045
caused by the quake.
- But!

628
00:44:02.712 --> 00:44:06.424
How could it survived for so long,

629
00:44:06.424 --> 00:44:06.925
cut out from the surface?

630
00:44:06.925 --> 00:44:08.468
Cannibalism.

631
00:44:09.677 --> 00:44:12.480
They must have fought each other to survive.

632
00:44:12.514 --> 00:44:13.807
Look!

633
00:44:16.226 --> 00:44:19.270
All those scars, on her scales.

634
00:44:19.562 --> 00:44:22.899
Notice! The eyes.

635
00:44:23.024 --> 00:44:25.485
Jesus. Like he's staring back at you.

636
00:44:25.485 --> 00:44:28.488
No, no, no! Not staring...

637
00:44:28.488 --> 00:44:30.698
sensing!

638
00:44:38.248 --> 00:44:39.499
God! Don't do that!

639
00:44:39.916 --> 00:44:42.919
Piranhas hunt in packs.

640
00:44:43.169 --> 00:44:44.212
Not for protection!

641
00:44:44.879 --> 00:44:46.840
But overwhelming force.

642
00:44:47.757 --> 00:44:50.510
They're organized, methodical...

643
00:44:51.803 --> 00:44:54.430
The first bite draws blood,

644
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.724
more blood draws the pack!

645
00:44:57.475 --> 00:44:59.477
So how are we going to stop them?

646
00:44:59.477 --> 00:45:02.605
Wait. I'm sorry, you're not actually
consider going back out onto the lake?

647
00:45:02.605 --> 00:45:05.191
They are killing machines but they're still fish.

648
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:06.359
You can catch them

649
00:45:06.359 --> 00:45:08.570
or kill them!

650
00:45:09.154 --> 00:45:11.698
If there really are thousands...

651
00:45:11.698 --> 00:45:12.740
Ya?

652
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:16.619
Yesterday would have been a good time to start.

653
00:46:28.358 --> 00:46:29.776
Oh Shit!

654
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.804
It's my little brother and sister!

655
00:46:32.862 --> 00:46:34.364
Are they waving for help?

656
00:46:35.824 --> 00:46:37.492
I don't know. They are supposed to be at home right now.

657
00:46:37.492 --> 00:46:38.535
I'm supposed to be home right now!

658
00:46:38.993 --> 00:46:40.286
Jake, jake, jake.

659
00:46:40.328 --> 00:46:41.821
What are you doing?! You're gonna miss my money shot!

660
00:46:41.871 --> 00:46:43.540
Okay. It's my family! Alright!

661
00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:44.582
They could be in trouble!

662
00:46:45.416 --> 00:46:47.210
You are gonna be the one in trouble,

663
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.171
if I don't get my flying catars right now!

664
00:46:49.212 --> 00:46:52.006
What the hell's wrong with you man?

665
00:46:56.511 --> 00:46:57.637
What's wrong with me?

666
00:47:00.056 --> 00:47:01.474
Oh, God dammit! You're missing it.
You're missing it...

667
00:47:01.474 --> 00:47:03.017
You're missing the shot!

668
00:47:04.894 --> 00:47:05.829
No, no, no...

669
00:47:05.895 --> 00:47:09.149
Wow! You missed it! What is wrong with you?

670
00:47:09.607 --> 00:47:11.376
Listen! They are stranded out there okay!

671
00:47:11.417 --> 00:47:13.836
They might need my help.

672
00:47:14.362 --> 00:47:15.363
Boobies, boobies...

673
00:47:15.363 --> 00:47:15.905
Alright!

674
00:47:15.905 --> 00:47:16.698
Listen to me.

675
00:47:17.282 --> 00:47:19.534
My mom is the Sheriff.

676
00:47:34.883 --> 00:47:36.134
Alright! Let's...

677
00:47:36.801 --> 00:47:37.719
swing by the island!

678
00:47:37.719 --> 00:47:38.761
Throw the minerals in the boat!

679
00:47:39.596 --> 00:47:40.763
It'll be great!

680
00:47:40.805 --> 00:47:41.848
It'll be fun.

681
00:48:07.874 --> 00:48:08.958
Take me up!

682
00:48:21.095 --> 00:48:22.263
Help me!

683
00:48:22.263 --> 00:48:23.306
Take me up!

684
00:48:23.389 --> 00:48:24.641
What the hell is goin on?

685
00:49:06.099 --> 00:49:08.852
Weapons of mass offensive right over here!

686
00:49:09.227 --> 00:49:10.228
Let's see those dance.

687
00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:11.729
Alright girls!

688
00:49:12.939 --> 00:49:14.023
Shake those booties!

689
00:49:14.023 --> 00:49:15.066
Shake those Hoolas!

690
00:49:15.358 --> 00:49:17.235
Willy Wonka and those chocolate factory!

691
00:49:39.215 --> 00:49:40.592
Yes, I need the National Guard...

692
00:49:41.092 --> 00:49:41.885
I need the Coast Guard.

693
00:49:41.885 --> 00:49:44.471
I need all the forces in your power to deploy!

694
00:49:46.473 --> 00:49:48.183
Everybody back to the beach!

695
00:49:49.392 --> 00:49:50.977
Move back to the dock! Everybody!

696
00:49:50.977 --> 00:49:52.020
Move back!

697
00:50:10.663 --> 00:50:12.916
Don't talk about Satan. Just take your boat back.

698
00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:15.126
No more talk about Satan.
Please!

699
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.713
Fuck them!

700
00:50:23.009 --> 00:50:24.093
What the fuck?

701
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:36.314
This is the Lake Victoria sheriff's department.

702
00:50:37.398 --> 00:50:40.735
The Sheriff has declared an emergency.

703
00:50:40.735 --> 00:50:42.862
Don't worry, we got beer over here!

704
00:50:43.947 --> 00:50:45.615
Geronimo!

705
00:50:47.408 --> 00:50:48.743
Hi! Get on out over there.

706
00:50:49.285 --> 00:50:51.496
I need you out of the water now!

707
00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.039
Yeah!

708
00:50:53.039 --> 00:50:54.624
Hit it DJ Chocolate Thunder!

709
00:51:27.949 --> 00:51:30.076
Is that Jake? Why is he here?

710
00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:30.952
I don't know.

711
00:51:31.536 --> 00:51:32.912
We're so busted.
- No!

712
00:51:33.121 --> 00:51:33.663
He is.

713
00:51:33.746 --> 00:51:35.456
I didn't even catch any fish!

714
00:51:35.707 --> 00:51:36.499
Slow down.

715
00:51:36.499 --> 00:51:39.502
Slow down!
Okay! I know what I'm doing... alright!

716
00:51:39.502 --> 00:51:41.504
Careful! It's not that deep!

717
00:51:43.256 --> 00:51:44.340
We're busted.

718
00:51:49.095 --> 00:51:50.847
Okay Jake! I'm not taking the fall for this.

719
00:51:50.847 --> 00:51:51.890
It was all Zane's idea.

720
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:55.143
I paid you $60 bucks to stay home.

721
00:51:55.143 --> 00:51:56.060
What do you mean!

722
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.353
How bout 40 we're call it even.

723
00:51:57.353 --> 00:51:59.522
How bout you get on this boat and we go home!

724
00:51:59.522 --> 00:52:00.690
End of story!

725
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.944
Just get on the boat!

726
00:52:05.528 --> 00:52:06.779
Woah, woah, woah!
- We should've been at Canyon Beach

727
00:52:06.779 --> 00:52:08.540
an hour ago for the mother fucking main event!

728
00:52:08.615 --> 00:52:11.618
C'mon!
- Alright! Go ahead! Speedo!

729
00:52:12.285 --> 00:52:13.328
Be careful getting outta here!

730
00:52:13.328 --> 00:52:15.788
the rocks sometimes circulate the engine!

731
00:52:24.088 --> 00:52:25.590
I want you to rest somehow, okay!

732
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:26.925
And keep Zane and Laura with you

733
00:52:26.925 --> 00:52:28.802
I don't want them anywhere near Derrick.

734
00:52:29.719 --> 00:52:31.763
Wow! The water is just so clear.

735
00:52:36.935 --> 00:52:38.186
What kind of fish was that?

736
00:52:38.561 --> 00:52:39.646
I don't know.

737
00:52:40.104 --> 00:52:41.981
I'm gonna make them take us
home right now okay.

738
00:52:44.818 --> 00:52:45.819
What is that?

739
00:52:46.444 --> 00:52:47.320
What happened?

740
00:52:49.531 --> 00:52:50.698
Are you guys okay?

741
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:53.243
I think we hit something.

742
00:53:01.543 --> 00:53:03.294
Andrew! what hell's going on now?

743
00:53:04.254 --> 00:53:06.172
I don't know! We're stuck on something!

744
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:08.133
Well! Fix it god dammit! Fix it!

745
00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.717
There are rocks everywhere!

746
00:53:09.717 --> 00:53:11.177
Yeah! There're rocks down here!

747
00:53:12.053 --> 00:53:13.096
What happened?

748
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:15.473
God! I think something caught on the prop (rotors).

749
00:53:16.766 --> 00:53:18.226
Okay, stay put!

750
00:53:18.518 --> 00:53:19.561
Alright.

751
00:53:19.769 --> 00:53:21.271
Crystal, get the sandrat up here.

752
00:53:23.106 --> 00:53:24.357
I said get the fucking sandrat up here!

753
00:53:24.357 --> 00:53:25.608
What's wrong with you!
- Hey!

754
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:28.611
Why didn't you go get him yourself?

755
00:53:37.662 --> 00:53:38.930
I just got here thinking...

756
00:53:38.955 --> 00:53:42.125
how this whole fucked up day has been your fault.

757
00:53:43.168 --> 00:53:44.294
Wanna help me with the new bitch?

758
00:53:44.919 --> 00:53:47.130
Don't do a fucking thing I tell you...

759
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.007

760
00:53:50.133 --> 00:53:51.134

00:53:52.343 --> 00:53:53.803
You're, you're new at this.

00:53:53.803 --> 00:53:56.306
I'm, I'm cool with that man. Really!

764
00:53:56.306 --> 00:53:57.348
I am... but, but...

765
00:53:57.599 --> 00:53:58.600
But what you do to me...

766
00:53:59.392 --> 00:54:01.352
What this is...

767
00:54:01.561 --> 00:54:03.396
Aarg! There is a word for it ...

768
00:54:03.396 --> 00:54:05.106
It's a... it's a...

769
00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:05.940
It's a boat word...

770
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.358
What is it? Ah...

771
00:54:08.276 --> 00:54:09.569
Mutiny.

772
00:54:09.569 --> 00:54:10.612
Is that what it is ?

773
00:54:10.945 --> 00:54:12.655
Is this a Mutiny?

774
00:54:13.156 --> 00:54:14.449
Relax Derrick. Okay.

775
00:54:14.449 --> 00:54:15.783
I'm just...

776
00:54:15.825 --> 00:54:16.826
I'm just going a bit wild.

777
00:54:24.459 --> 00:54:25.793
If anyone should down there helping,

00:54:25.793 --> 00:54:27.295

00:54:29.839 --> 00:54:30.632

Mom?

872
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:22.714
I'm sorry, I screwed up. We're on the lake.

01:08:24.215 --> 01:08:25.592
Where's Lauren and Zane?

They're with me on the boat.

876
01:08:27.594 --> 01:08:28.470
Oh my god! Jake.

877
01:08:29.179 --> 01:08:31.014
Whatever you do, do not go into the water!

878
01:08:31.639 --> 01:08:33.892
You do not understand, Mom! Our boat is sinking!

879
01:08:35.018 --> 01:08:36.060

888
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.369
How're gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.

889
01:09:34.869 --> 01:09:36.287
Use the rope.

890
01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:37.330
Here! They gonna reach!

891
01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:38.665

Jake! I'm gonna throw you the rope!

893
01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:42.794
Attach it to the highest railing!

894
01:09:42.836 --> 01:09:43.837
Okay, mom!

895
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:46.965
Back it up.

896
01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:51.636
Back it up this way.

897
01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:56.474
Watch out for rocks!

898
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.977
Yo! Watch out!

899
01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:00.270

I've got my radio.

906
01:10:26.671 --> 01:10:28.173
Okay! Just get there!

907
01:10:40.935 --> 01:10:41.978

Mom, are you okay?

909
01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:52.405
Is this everybody on the boat?

910
01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:55.325
No! Kelly is still stuck down there in the cabin,

911
01:10:55.325 --> 01:10:56.326

912
01:10:56.326 --> 01:10:57.368
We can't get her out!

01:11:04.959 --> 01:11:06.044
Can you grab my arm?

919
01:11:06.252 --> 01:11:08.405
You gonna help me get out of here.
The water's getting higher!

920
01:11:08.421 --> 01:11:11.508
Can you reach the skylight?
- You better hurry! I'm fucking stuck!

921
01:11:11.549 --> 01:11:12.592
Julie!

922
01:11:12.634 --> 01:11:13.885
You think I'd didn't try to pry that thing!

923
01:11:13.885 --> 01:11:14.928
God dammit!

924
01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:16.596
Jake!

925
01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:18.807
You guys! I'm scared!

926
01:11:19.224 --> 01:11:20.600
Please help!

927
01:11:22.393 --> 01:11:23.895
Mom, we have to hurry!

928
01:11:24.187 --> 01:11:25.230
Kelly?

929
01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:26.556
Kelly!

930
01:11:26.648 --> 01:11:27.690
We all gonna die?

931
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:29.484
We're not gonna die. Okay!

932
01:11:36.741 --> 01:11:39.369
I need your help! Please!

933
01:11:39.869 --> 01:11:40.912
Jake!

934
01:11:41.246 --> 01:11:43.248
The only way to get through to her is the bottom of the boat.

935
01:11:43.456 --> 01:11:44.415
Get to the rope.

936
01:11:45.375 --> 01:11:46.167
What are you talking about?

937
01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:47.836
We can't just leave her down there!

938
01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.921
Once I get everyone across on the rope...

939
01:11:49.921 --> 01:11:51.381
I'm gonna come back for her!

940
01:11:51.506 --> 01:11:53.842
No! I'm not gonna leave without! Mom!

941
01:11:53.883 --> 01:11:54.801
Jesus Christ! Jake!

942
01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:56.094
The only way to get to her!

943
01:11:56.094 --> 01:11:58.304
Is for you to get into the water and
I'm not gonna let you do that!

944
01:11:58.304 --> 01:11:59.430
Now! C'mon and get on the boat...

945
01:11:59.472 --> 01:12:01.099
Listen to me! The reason she came on this boat!

946
01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.475
Was because of me! Okay!

947
01:12:02.475 --> 01:12:04.018
It's MY fault!

948
01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:08.898
I'm not coming without her...

949
01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:11.109
Okay! This rope ain't gonna hold much longer!

950
01:12:11.109 --> 01:12:12.152
Let's go!

951
01:12:13.903 --> 01:12:16.698
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across and
I'm coming back!

952
01:12:17.323 --> 01:12:19.159
And we're gonna do it together.

953
01:12:19.617 --> 01:12:20.702
Alright.

954
01:12:21.244 --> 01:12:23.371
Alright! We're gonna keep two of them between us.

955
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:24.831
You gonna go first.

956
01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:26.332
Can you do this?

957
01:12:26.332 --> 01:12:29.711
Better believe it. Got my pull-ons for nothing.

958
01:12:33.047 --> 01:12:35.758
You have a lot of explaining to do.

959
01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:39.262
Okay, ready?

960
01:12:46.769 --> 01:12:49.105
Okay! Be careful! Don't look down! Let's go!

961
01:12:57.572 --> 01:12:59.407
Just like the playground...

962
01:12:59.407 --> 01:13:01.451
Hand over hand.

963
01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:05.288
Don't look down.

964
01:13:06.706 --> 01:13:08.124
Don't look down, alright!

965
01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:11.544
Keep going. C'mon! You can do it.

966
01:13:11.878 --> 01:13:13.046
Hand over hand!

967
01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:14.088
I'm scared!

968
01:13:18.301 --> 01:13:19.177
Keep going!

969
01:13:21.596 --> 01:13:23.181
Careful.

970
01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:25.141
Don't look down.

971
01:13:25.266 --> 01:13:26.309
Okay!

972
01:13:26.309 --> 01:13:27.352
Oh god!

973
01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:32.565
They're biting me!

974
01:13:33.983 --> 01:13:35.026
Oh god!

975
01:13:39.614 --> 01:13:42.867
Get off me!

976
01:13:55.755 --> 01:13:57.298
No! No! NO!

977
01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:04.389
God dammit!

978
01:14:11.688 --> 01:14:12.939
Listen to me! Both of you!

979
01:14:13.606 --> 01:14:14.899
If you move fast!

980
01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:16.109
It will NOT get you.

981
01:14:16.109 --> 01:14:17.986
You have to move NOW!

982
01:14:18.611 --> 01:14:19.571
Come on! MOVE IT!

983
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:20.613
You can do it!

984
01:14:20.864 --> 01:14:21.906
GO!

985
01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:25.285
Keep moving now!

986
01:14:29.706 --> 01:14:30.748
Keep going!

987
01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:32.500
Okay guys!

988
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.836
Good! You're here!

989
01:14:37.422 --> 01:14:39.174
Good going you guys did it!

990
01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:45.805
Dammit!

991
01:14:51.811 --> 01:14:53.897
C'mon mom! Keep moving!

992
01:14:58.568 --> 01:14:59.527
You okay?

993
01:14:59.777 --> 01:15:01.029
Cut the engine!

994
01:15:02.614 --> 01:15:03.406
What are you doing?

995
01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:06.117
Jake! What are you doing?

996
01:15:09.078 --> 01:15:10.205
What are you doing?!

997
01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:11.164
Jake!

998
01:15:11.623 --> 01:15:13.016
Jake! Do not do that!
- Please!

999
01:15:13.049 --> 01:15:15.043
After all they want blood right?

1000
01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.586
Let's give it to them.

1001
01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:29.516
Wet T-shirt...

1002
01:15:30.850 --> 01:15:31.893
Wet T-shirt...

1003
01:16:53.892 --> 01:16:54.058
Jake!

1004
01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:57.437
Oh my god!

1005
01:17:00.565 --> 01:17:01.274
We're getting outta of here. Okay!

1006
01:17:01.274 --> 01:17:02.317
Both of us!

1007
01:17:04.027 --> 01:17:04.736
Okay I'm in!

1008
01:17:04.736 --> 01:17:06.154
I need you guys to pull us out!

1009
01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:07.489
As fast as possible.

1010
01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:08.406
Do you copy?

1011
01:17:08.406 --> 01:17:09.991
Okay! We're ready when you are.

1012
01:17:16.539 --> 01:17:18.458
Jake! What are you doing?
They're gonna come back!

1013
01:17:18.549 --> 01:17:21.085
I gave them a scare okay! That's gonna
hold them off for at least...

1014
01:17:21.085 --> 01:17:22.837
couple of minutes.

1015
01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:29.761
Okay! I need you to tie these together okay!
- Why?

1016
01:17:29.761 --> 01:17:30.970
Just do it!

1017
01:17:31.429 --> 01:17:32.931
Jake! Where are you going?!

1018
01:17:35.016 --> 01:17:36.976
Jake!

1019
01:17:57.872 --> 01:17:59.207
I need to you to hold your breath...

1020
01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:02.460
And we're gonna swim out
of the bottom of the boat. Okay!

1021
01:18:02.877 --> 01:18:04.087
And I need you to hold on tight!

1022
01:18:04.087 --> 01:18:05.547
Can you hold on TIGHT to me?

1023
01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:09.676
Alright...

1024
01:18:11.136 --> 01:18:13.471
Do you clear! Pull us out in 10 seconds! Okay?

1025
01:18:13.471 --> 01:18:14.514
Do you guys copy?!

1026
01:18:14.514 --> 01:18:16.057
Copy that! Ten seconds on your signal.

1027
01:18:16.057 --> 01:18:17.433
Get the kids down.

1028
01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.072
10.

1029
01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:49.757
6 ... 5 ... 4 ...

1030
01:18:50.717 --> 01:18:53.928
... 3 ... 2 ... 1

1031
01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:04.772
Eh...! What's wrong?

1032
01:19:05.732 --> 01:19:06.774
C'mon!

1033
01:19:06.774 --> 01:19:07.817
Stuck!

1034
01:19:08.985 --> 01:19:10.028
Rud clear!

1035
01:19:10.153 --> 01:19:11.196
God dammit!

1036
01:19:11.196 --> 01:19:12.138
Is it in gear?

1037
01:19:12.197 --> 01:19:12.739
No!

1038
01:19:12.739 --> 01:19:13.682
C'mon!

1039
01:19:14.699 --> 01:19:16.534
C'mon! You fucking thing!

1040
01:19:26.377 --> 01:19:28.296
It's gotta work! It's gotta work!

1041
01:19:56.074 --> 01:19:57.200
Oh my god!

1042
01:19:57.951 --> 01:19:59.285
Holy shit!

1043
01:20:19.055 --> 01:20:19.889
You alright?!

1044
01:20:22.016 --> 01:20:24.018
Come!

1045
01:20:24.018 --> 01:20:25.061
C'mon!

1046
01:20:27.313 --> 01:20:28.356
C'mon!

1047
01:20:30.984 --> 01:20:33.069
C'mon! You're alright! You're alright!

1048
01:20:33.736 --> 01:20:34.529
Breathe! You're okay!

1049
01:20:35.113 --> 01:20:36.156
You're okay!

1050
01:20:37.407 --> 01:20:38.449
You're okay!

1051
01:20:38.741 --> 01:20:39.784
You're okay!

1052
01:20:39.909 --> 01:20:40.618
Oh my god!

1053
01:20:40.618 --> 01:20:41.995
Glad to have you on board!

1054
01:20:41.995 --> 01:20:43.037
Jesus Christ!

1055
01:20:44.789 --> 01:20:45.623
Holy shit!

1056
01:20:50.128 --> 01:20:51.921
Look! Mom! Over here!

1057
01:20:53.256 --> 01:20:54.340
They died!

1058
01:20:56.050 --> 01:20:57.051
They're all dead!

1059
01:21:11.774 --> 01:21:13.026
You did it Jake!

1060
01:21:13.276 --> 01:21:14.527
I did!

1061
01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:15.653
It worked!

1062
01:21:15.695 --> 01:21:18.990
Hey! I thought dynamite fishing was
illegal in these parts sheriff?

1063
01:21:20.283 --> 01:21:21.360
Sheriff?

1064
01:21:21.401 --> 01:21:22.443
Sheriff?

1065
01:21:23.328 --> 01:21:24.621
Yeah! This is Julie!

1066
01:21:26.331 --> 01:21:27.624
Julie... this is Carl.

1067
01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:30.043
We have a major problem.

1068
01:21:30.043 --> 01:21:32.837
Well! I am looking out at a school of dead piranhas.

1069
01:21:32.837 --> 01:21:34.856
Not all of them but I think it's a good start.

1070
01:21:34.906 --> 01:21:36.949
You don't understand.

1071
01:21:37.634 --> 01:21:39.886
The specimen you left with me...

1072
01:21:39.886 --> 01:21:43.848
has no mature reproductive organs.

1073
01:21:45.642 --> 01:21:46.100
What?

1074
01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.520
What are you talking about?

1075
01:21:49.187 --> 01:21:52.023
The piranhas that killed those divers...

1076
01:21:52.023 --> 01:21:53.566
the ones you're hurting for...

1077
01:21:54.859 --> 01:21:56.820
They are not fully developed.

1078
01:21:57.195 --> 01:21:59.197
They're the babies!

1079
01:22:02.367 --> 01:22:03.827
Babies?

1080
01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:06.412
huh...

1081
01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:08.248
So?

1082
01:22:08.248 --> 01:22:11.501
Where are the parents?
