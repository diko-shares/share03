- No.

All right. You better.

Get outta here.

168
00:12:39.548 --> 00:12:42.467
- Next year I'll try to find another solution.
- All right.

169
00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:47.468
- All right?
- Okay.

Maggie said that yesterday
was the last time she saw him?

177
00:13:33.018 --> 00:13:34.602
Yeah, just before noon.

178
00:13:34.603 --> 00:13:37.563
She said Matt took the boat out
to catch some bass.

179
00:13:37.564 --> 00:13:40.441
She drove around the lake all night
looking for him.

180
00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:45.442
- Where's the boat?
- Over there.

- MAN: By the way, Gordon called last night.
- Yeah?

187
00:14:10.514 --> 00:14:14.726
He said the USGS recorded heavy
seismic activity beneath the lake.

188
00:14:14.727 --> 00:14:16.144
Really?

189
00:14:16.145 --> 00:14:18.980
They're sending in a team
of seismologist divers.

190
00:14:18.981 --> 00:14:20.648
All right.

191
00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.609
And he told them
that you're gonna escort them out.

192
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.236
Jesus Christ!

193
00:14:25.237 --> 00:14:29.615
I've just been invaded by 20,000 kids -
makes us a little busy at the moment.

194
00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:33.244
- That's what I told him.
- <i>(Pier creaking and cracking)</i>

00:14:33.245 --> 00:14:38.245
This doesn't sound too good.

196

So, what time are the divers
gonna get here?

197
00:14:53.766 --> 00:14:58.766
They said by ten.

Come on, just a little more.

201

could have done this?</i>

207
00:15:44.942 --> 00:15:47.485
I doubt it.
Look at the bones, nothing's broken.

208
00:15:47.486 --> 00:15:51.697
It's like something acidic,
or toxic decomposition,

209
00:15:51.698 --> 00:15:55.159
as if this body's been in the water
for weeks.

210
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.372
What would you say if I told you
that I'm thinking about closing the lake?

211
00:15:59.373 --> 00:16:01.707
Just until we get an autopsy report.

212
00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:04.877
An autopsy report is gonna
take a couple of days.

213
00:16:04.878 --> 00:16:07.713
It'd be easier to drain this lake
than to close it.

214
00:16:07.714 --> 00:16:11.217
It's a big financial week
for our town.

215
00:16:11.218 --> 00:16:16.218
I'm too old for this.

- What if I give you the babysitting cash?

224

to pygocentrus nattereri,

They used to swim the Colorado River

so long cut off from the surface?
