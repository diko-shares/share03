1
00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:27.287
When I hear
people say, "I lost faith,"

2
00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:32.901
I picture them giving up, no
longer able to keep looking.

3
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.383
It wasn't like that for me.

4
00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:40.909
I even thought, selfishly, witnessing
a war would bring me closer to God.

5
00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:44.608
But the more I prayed, the
more empty my prayers seemed.

6
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.708
They were whispers into a void.

7
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.890
I was looking for a sign. Any sign.

8
00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:12.506
But it was quiet.

9
00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:18.425
Yeah, I'm still here.
I'm listening.

10
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.516
How can I help?

11
00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.218
Have you talked to
anyone at the VA?

12
00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:30.872
They have people who...

13
00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.223
No,
I understand.

14
00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:38.009
Thank you for saying that,
but I'm not...

15
00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:40.838
Matt, I'm not,
uh, qualified.

16
00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:44.842
Is there anyone at work?

17
00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:47.976
I mean, the NSA must be full
of other vets. Right?

18
00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:01.424
No, I get it.
Appearances matter.

19
00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.690
Sure.
Anything. Yeah.

20
00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.259
Hey. Sorry.
Give me a minute. I'm sorry. Hold on.

21
00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:12.696
Okay.

22
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.308
Okay.

23
00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:18.441
Let me ask around.
I'll find someone good. I will.

24
00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:23.403
I'll call you
as soon as I...

25
00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:30.236
But I'll be in the office
right after that.

26
00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.760
I'll get you a name. Okay?
I promise.

27
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.769
Hey. Hey. Matt.

28
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860
Hey, hey, come on, man.

29
00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:47.992
Come on.
I was there.

30
00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.907
I get it.

31
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:53.433
We're gonna get you some help.
Okay? I'll call you tomorrow.

32
00:03:53.476 --> 00:03:55.522
Maybe read Psalms
if you get a minute.

33
00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.915
There's some stuff in there
that always helps me.

34
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.744
Love you too, buddy.
Bye.

35
00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:05.096
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.403
You're the one
who wanted to talk.

37
00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.492
Sarah,
he was crying.

38
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:13.453
Sorry. You know, I...
I like Matt.

39
00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:16.325
Is... Is he okay?

40
00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:18.893
I don't know. Uh...

41
00:04:18.936 --> 00:04:20.808
It was bad over there.

42
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:23.593
It's always bad.
It was bad for you too.Yeah.

43
00:04:23.637 --> 00:04:26.509
But I was just there to write, not fight.
Big difference.

44
00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:30.078
Look, I really
have to get to work.

45
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.481
- I got this, uh, interview.
- Interview, yeah. No, I heard.

46
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.041
Hey, I want this... us
to work.

47
00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:40.958
Tell me what to do.
How many times do you want me to apologize?

48
00:04:41.002 --> 00:04:43.110
Stop apologizing. Just tell me the number.
I'll do it.

49
00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:45.746
Things happen. How many times
do I have to live through it?

50
00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.835
Things happen, but I'm here.
Now. I'm back.

51
00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:50.798
It's only been worse since you've been
back, Paul. I can't live like this.

52
00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:53.536
I can change. I can be better.
I want to be better.

53
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.409
Can't we fix this? Fix?

54
00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.804
When trust in a marriage has been broken,
how do you fix that?

55
00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:04.373
You want to throw all this
away because of one mistake?

56
00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.854
It was my fault.
I get in my head sometimes.

57
00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:10.727
Can we at least talk
to someone? Anyone?

58
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:12.555
Hey, hey.

59
00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.819
Can we... Can we talk tonight?
Please? Can we...

60
00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:18.953
I'm not sure I'll be here.
I need to think.

61
00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:21.916
You're gonna be late for your interview,
and I really have to get to work.

62
00:05:25.046 --> 00:05:26.526
Yeah.

63
00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:48.112
Good morning.

64
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:50.506
Morning.

65
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.639
Like clockwork,
you two.

66
00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:28.631
I'll call you later.

67
00:08:12.343 --> 00:08:13.562
Good morning.

68
00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.522
Sorry I'm late.
Uh...

69
00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:19.350
I had to...
Sorry I'm late.

70
00:08:19.394 --> 00:08:21.091
Oh, only five minutes.

71
00:08:21.135 --> 00:08:24.878
Still leaves us 25
minutes as agreed.

72
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.533
Uh, right. Thirty minutes
today, tomorrow, and Friday.

73
00:08:27.576 --> 00:08:29.578
Mm-hmm. Everyone's, uh...

74
00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:32.886
Busy?

75
00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:35.279
That's right.
Everyone's busy.

76
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.152
Are you okay?

77
00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.720
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
I'm great.

78
00:08:40.763 --> 00:08:43.810
Sorry. Uh... Paul Asher.
With The Herald.

79
00:08:43.853 --> 00:08:46.116
Uh, I know
who you are.

80
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.989
I know all your work.
I'm a fan.Thanks.

81
00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:51.165
Oh.

82
00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:52.819
Uh, sorry.
Do you mind?

83
00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.299
Okay.
A few ground rules.

84
00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:57.867
I'm recording this
conversation for accuracy.

85
00:08:57.911 --> 00:09:00.783
Also three sessions...
today, tomorrow, and Friday.

86
00:09:00.827 --> 00:09:04.395
When we're done I'll show you what I wrote,
but I retain editorial control.

87
00:09:04.439 --> 00:09:05.832
Do you agree? Agreed.

88
00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.704
And I expect
great things.

89
00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.619
Okay, but don't
get your hopes up.

90
00:09:10.663 --> 00:09:12.490
I cover religion
for a secular paper,

91
00:09:12.534 --> 00:09:15.058
and the stuff I write usually ends
up in the Lifestyles section.

92
00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:18.235
You're just being modest. Horoscopes
get better placement.

93
00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:21.978
Well, the reporting you did from
Afghanistan was very impressive.

94
00:09:22.022 --> 00:09:25.199
You followed that? Every word.

95
00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:27.157
Christians in combat?

96
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.159
That must have been
a tough assignment.

97
00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:32.075
Tough on you.
Tough on your family.

98
00:09:32.119 --> 00:09:33.903
Tougher for others.

99
00:09:33.947 --> 00:09:35.731
I was just there to write.

100
00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.820
But I met
some amazing people.

101
00:09:37.864 --> 00:09:41.737
Well, I'd love to hear more about
your personal experiences over there.

102
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.826
Yeah.
Maybe some other time.

103
00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.699
So, unless we're here
to play chess,

104
00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:48.439
let's talk about you.

105
00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:50.703
Do you play? Me? No.

106
00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:53.488
Never? When I was a kid.

107
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:55.795
Anyway... But not anymore?

108
00:09:57.492 --> 00:09:59.842
My father used to
bring me here.

109
00:09:59.886 --> 00:10:01.888
I used to play a little back then.
Anyway...

110
00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.065
Shall we?

111
00:10:05.108 --> 00:10:08.416
Okay. Today is June 1. Please
say your name and spell it.

112
00:10:10.548 --> 00:10:13.813
I'm God. G-O-D.

113
00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:18.426
Okay. Great.

114
00:10:18.469 --> 00:10:20.036
Uh, let's start.

115
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.560
Thanks for agreeing
to do this interview.

116
00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:24.388
Well, youagreed.

117
00:10:24.432 --> 00:10:26.173
But you're welcome.Oh.

118
00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:29.132
Can I get
a shot of you? Sure.

119
00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:31.744
So,
no problem you showing up in a photo?

120
00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:34.442
Well, I'm a deity,
not a vampire.

121
00:10:42.406 --> 00:10:44.800
I've gotta say,
you look human enough to me.

122
00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:48.108
And you know,
you look godlike to me.

123
00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:51.589
I get that. Genesis.
In his image.

124
00:10:51.633 --> 00:10:53.983
That's pretty funny. Thank you.

125
00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:57.030
So, uh, why did you agree
to do this interview?

126
00:10:57.073 --> 00:10:59.467
I talk to my children
all the time.

127
00:11:00.816 --> 00:11:03.471
I see.
So I'm one of your children. Of course.

128
00:11:03.514 --> 00:11:07.040
Okay, well, there's a name for people
you usually talk to like this.

129
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.998
"Lucky"?

130
00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:12.001
I think I meant
"prophets." Oh, sure. Yes.

131
00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:16.702
That's what they're called afterI
speak to them, but before that...

132
00:11:16.745 --> 00:11:22.011
Many of them weren't too happy to see me
when I showed up. At least not at first.

133
00:11:22.055 --> 00:11:23.534
Right.

134
00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:26.450
A burning bush, a pillar of fire.
Pretty dramatic stuff.

135
00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:29.845
I'll bet people
freaked out. Oh, they did, they did.

136
00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:32.239
But, uh,
I got their attention.

137
00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:34.589
No burning bush today?

138
00:11:34.632 --> 00:11:36.591
Would you like that?

139
00:11:36.634 --> 00:11:38.462
Is that what you
really want?

140
00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:41.683
Okay.

141
00:11:41.727 --> 00:11:46.209
Um... uh, what exactly would you
like to see burst into flames?

142
00:11:46.253 --> 00:11:48.603
Something in this park
perhaps?

143
00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:51.432
Uh, how about
that pillar?

144
00:11:51.475 --> 00:11:53.477
Or maybe the tree,
huh?

145
00:11:55.392 --> 00:11:56.742
No, of course not.

146
00:11:56.785 --> 00:11:58.787
Well,
it's not necessary.

147
00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:00.920
You're here. I'm here.
We're already talking.

148
00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:08.405
Getting back to my question,
is that why you're here? Am I a prophet?

149
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:10.407
Are you a prophet?

150
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:11.495
Well...

151
00:12:12.714 --> 00:12:14.585
We're...
We're talking. Okay?

152
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:16.022
Th-That's a start.

153
00:12:16.805 --> 00:12:18.285
Okay.

154
00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:21.114
Circle back to that.

155
00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:25.509
Okay, so you're God. The
God.

156
00:12:25.553 --> 00:12:28.599
The one who created everything.
Heaven and earth in six days.

157
00:12:28.643 --> 00:12:31.777
Uh, yep.
But, uh, then I rested.

158
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.475
So, nice work. Thank you.

159
00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:37.347
I try.

160
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.610
But i-is this really
what you wanted to know,

161
00:12:39.654 --> 00:12:42.265
just some biographical
information about my work?

162
00:12:42.309 --> 00:12:45.660
I'm sure you could read all
about it in a book somewhere.

163
00:12:45.703 --> 00:12:48.968
Well, sure, but you know, my readers
expect some fact-checking in my work.

164
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:51.100
Facts. Yes.Mm-hmm.

165
00:12:51.144 --> 00:12:52.798
Yes,
always the facts.

166
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:54.625
Okay. Fine.

167
00:12:54.669 --> 00:12:56.323
Well,
please continue.

168
00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:01.371
Uh... how old are you?

169
00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:03.983
Time is different for me
than it is for you.

170
00:13:04.026 --> 00:13:07.073
I mean, I exist
outside of time.

171
00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:09.249
After all,
I created time.

172
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:11.860
Right.

173
00:13:14.863 --> 00:13:16.691
Where do you come from?

174
00:13:16.734 --> 00:13:19.868
Paul, I think this interview
would be more productive

175
00:13:19.912 --> 00:13:23.872
if we don't waste time on questions to
which you already know the answers.

176
00:13:23.916 --> 00:13:26.135
Okay. Moving on.

177
00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:27.920
Paul, I'm not
being difficult.

178
00:13:27.963 --> 00:13:30.487
I just... I just think
you of all people

179
00:13:30.531 --> 00:13:33.664
should know why my answers
might be confusing.

180
00:13:33.708 --> 00:13:37.320
I mean, if the, uh...
if the nature of God were obvious...

181
00:13:38.974 --> 00:13:41.107
Well, look at the world
around you

182
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.457
and you will see
that it is not.

183
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.374
So we struggle here on earth to know you, but I
assume you know all the questions and answers.

184
00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:48.766
Mm-hmm. Of course.

185
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.768
Does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

186
00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:54.424
But then you know the answer
to that question too, right? Yes.

187
00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.514
But a divine perspective
is not required.

188
00:13:57.558 --> 00:14:00.996
Try to see this from my point of view.
This is not an easy process.

189
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.345
No, I get it.

190
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:04.347
Knowing all the questions
and all the answers

191
00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:07.350
must make human conversation
kind of difficult.

192
00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:10.353
Well, no one likes
a know-it-all.

193
00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:12.138
Right.Mm-hmm.

194
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:15.793
All right, you said,
"you of all people" a few moments ago.

195
00:14:15.837 --> 00:14:20.320
You said, "You of all people should know why
my answers might be a little confusing."

196
00:14:22.148 --> 00:14:25.107
What do you mean by that?
Why me of all people?

197
00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:27.980
Well, you have a degree
in religious studies

198
00:14:28.023 --> 00:14:30.896
and a degree in journalism
from Loyola University,

199
00:14:30.939 --> 00:14:33.246
where you graduated
the top of your class.

200
00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.423
You started working at The
Herald in their online division

201
00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:37.859
right out of college,

202
00:14:37.903 --> 00:14:41.036
where you write about matters
of faith and theology.

203
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.386
So you memorized
my online bio.Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.693
And I also know
about your marriage.

205
00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:48.914
Excuse me?

206
00:14:48.957 --> 00:14:50.959
I know
about your marriage.

207
00:14:54.963 --> 00:14:56.356
Oh.

208
00:14:57.705 --> 00:14:59.620
You had me going
for a second.

209
00:14:59.663 --> 00:15:02.144
Yes, I did,
didn't I?

210
00:15:02.188 --> 00:15:04.973
You're waiting for me
to ask. Ask what?

211
00:15:05.017 --> 00:15:06.801
For proof.Ah.

212
00:15:06.844 --> 00:15:09.586
Proof that you are
who you say you are.

213
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.458
Yeah, proof.

214
00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:12.981
Well, tell me, Paul,

215
00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:18.508
when you pray,
do you ask for proof that God is listening?

216
00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:20.467
No. Of course not.

217
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.383
Then this is
your lucky day. How so?

218
00:15:23.426 --> 00:15:25.863
I'm here, answering
your questions.

219
00:15:25.907 --> 00:15:28.779
I hope
I'm being cooperative.

220
00:15:28.823 --> 00:15:30.303
You are.

221
00:15:34.742 --> 00:15:38.311
So, what do I tell the people
who say you don't exist?

222
00:15:38.354 --> 00:15:41.227
You tell them
that I understand,

223
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.838
but the world they see
is just that.

224
00:15:43.881 --> 00:15:47.494
Sometimes that's
just the way it looks.

225
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.976
That's a good answer.

226
00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:53.021
Good. I'm glad.

227
00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:55.458
You're a very good
interviewer, Paul.Thanks.

228
00:15:55.502 --> 00:15:59.027
Yeah, you've established trust,
established rapport.

229
00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:01.073
Yeah, you're not at all
condescending,

230
00:16:01.116 --> 00:16:03.249
and you want the truth
above all else.

231
00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:06.295
Yeah.
The truth would be cool.

232
00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:08.515
Well,
that's my specialty.

233
00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:14.564
Okay.
Uh, the lightning round and in no order.

234
00:16:14.608 --> 00:16:17.045
Lightning round.
That's cute.

235
00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:18.916
What is the meaning
of life?

236
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.310
To live, to struggle,
to serve God,

237
00:16:21.354 --> 00:16:24.487
and to ask questions like,
"What is the meaning of life?"

238
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:27.577
Are the Torah and the New
Testament the word of God?

239
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:32.887
Of course. But as understood by
man and as translated by man.

240
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.584
There's some
wiggle room there.

241
00:16:34.628 --> 00:16:36.369
No.

242
00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:39.720
Well, everyone has their own journey,
but there is only one path.

243
00:16:39.763 --> 00:16:42.636
Was there ever a time
when God didn't exist?

244
00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:46.074
- Well, I could give you the answer I gave Moses.
- Okay.

245
00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:49.034
I am that I am.

246
00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:50.470
Right.

247
00:16:50.513 --> 00:16:53.081
I should have known that.Yes.

248
00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:56.258
And it's as true today
as it was back then.

249
00:16:56.302 --> 00:16:58.304
Is there a heaven? Oh, yes.

250
00:16:58.347 --> 00:17:01.046
But try not to think of it
as just a place.

251
00:17:01.089 --> 00:17:03.396
So Satan is also real?

252
00:17:04.745 --> 00:17:07.791
Yes, but frankly,
Satan is overrated.

253
00:17:07.835 --> 00:17:10.142
Overrated?
That's a funny way to put it. How so?

254
00:17:10.185 --> 00:17:13.536
Well, he only has power to the
extent that you give it to him.

255
00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:18.237
What happens to us
after we die?

256
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.978
You are reunited
with the everlasting.

257
00:17:21.022 --> 00:17:22.415
So my soul is immortal?

258
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.113
Well, it wouldn't be
much of a soul if it wasn't.

259
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:30.205
Can an atheist
be a moral person? Sure. Sure.

260
00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:34.514
And you can build a home
on no foundation.

261
00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:38.474
But you just better hope
that the earth never shakes.

262
00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:43.827
Is God love?

263
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:48.789
He doesn't boast,
but yes, absolutely.

264
00:17:48.832 --> 00:17:52.923
What's 2,427 times 648?

265
00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:57.276
1,572,696.

266
00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:03.847
For real?

267
00:18:06.154 --> 00:18:08.025
I'm sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.

268
00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:10.376
No, that's all right.
God forgives.

269
00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:13.118
But this is
interesting. What's that?

270
00:18:13.161 --> 00:18:15.120
There's a lot of
good questions here,

271
00:18:15.163 --> 00:18:20.037
but you haven't asked me the one question
I get asked almost more than any other.

272
00:18:20.081 --> 00:18:22.866
No? What's that? Well, take a guess.

273
00:18:25.826 --> 00:18:27.828
Why do bad things happen
to good people?

274
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:30.526
That's the one. No, that's not on my list.

275
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.616
And frankly, I don't like
that question very much. No?

276
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.183
Why not?

277
00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:39.405
Because it's not really a question, is it?
It's a complaint.

278
00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:42.451
What it really means is,
why do bad things happen to me?

279
00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:45.150
And the person asking is
assuming they're a good person,

280
00:18:45.193 --> 00:18:46.934
which seems arrogant to me.

281
00:18:46.977 --> 00:18:49.328
But, Paul,

282
00:18:49.371 --> 00:18:52.679
bad things do happen
to some very good people.

283
00:18:54.942 --> 00:18:56.813
It is
a big question.

284
00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.077
Yes. I know.

285
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:02.254
I'll answer it
if you'd like.

286
00:19:05.257 --> 00:19:06.910
No. Let's move on.

287
00:19:07.998 --> 00:19:09.783
Okay.

288
00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.356
Does free will exist?
And how do we reconcile it with God's will?

289
00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:20.924
Finally.

290
00:19:20.968 --> 00:19:23.144
Finally?
What does that mean?

291
00:19:23.188 --> 00:19:25.494
It's an adverb
meaning "at last."

292
00:19:25.538 --> 00:19:28.671
Cute.
You know what I meant.

293
00:19:28.715 --> 00:19:31.892
No, finally you are asking me
some questions you care about.

294
00:19:31.935 --> 00:19:34.503
I care about
all the questions. Well, maybe.

295
00:19:34.547 --> 00:19:37.941
But you care about some of
the answers more than others.

296
00:19:37.985 --> 00:19:40.117
Look, this is not about me.

297
00:19:40.161 --> 00:19:41.728
Really?

298
00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.558
Does free will exist?

299
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.125
Did I force you
to come to this meeting?

300
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:49.997
Would I know it
if you did?

301
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.827
That reminds me
of an old joke.

302
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.829
A student goes to his rabbi
and says,

303
00:19:55.872 --> 00:19:58.397
"Rabbi, why do you
and the other rabbis

304
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.008
always answer my questions
with another question?"

305
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:04.577
And the rabbi replies,
"So how should we answer?"

306
00:20:05.534 --> 00:20:08.320
Okay. You didn't laugh
at God's joke.

307
00:20:08.363 --> 00:20:11.236
So what does that say
about free will?

308
00:20:11.279 --> 00:20:14.108
Of course
there's free will, Paul,

309
00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:16.066
and everybody knows
this is true.

310
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.680
The entire foundation of human law
depends on the existence of free will.

311
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.378
Try going before a judge

312
00:20:23.422 --> 00:20:25.337
when you've been charged
with a crime.

313
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.382
Blame your actions
on God's will.

314
00:20:27.426 --> 00:20:29.254
See how that
works out for you.Hmm.

315
00:20:29.297 --> 00:20:32.257
Now, does this mean that every
human act is a matter of free will?

316
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.954
Of course not.

317
00:20:33.997 --> 00:20:37.784
No more than you can use free will
to grow back an amputated leg.

318
00:20:37.827 --> 00:20:40.656
So, stuff happens and God says,
"Hey, man, don't look at me."

319
00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.092
No. No.

320
00:20:42.136 --> 00:20:46.271
You have to understand
that my will and human free will

321
00:20:46.314 --> 00:20:47.881
are not contradictory

322
00:20:47.924 --> 00:20:50.405
because they are not two
versions of the same thing,

323
00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:53.060
but they do fit
perfectly together.

324
00:20:53.103 --> 00:20:55.018
I designed it that way.

325
00:20:55.062 --> 00:20:58.239
Yeah, but if I can't tell where
one begins and the other ends...

326
00:20:58.283 --> 00:20:59.980
Do you see my problem?

327
00:21:00.023 --> 00:21:02.417
Hmm.
Yeah, I think I see.

328
00:21:02.461 --> 00:21:03.940
Do you? Yeah.

329
00:21:03.984 --> 00:21:06.552
Is the problem that
you don't trust God's plan,

330
00:21:06.595 --> 00:21:08.597
or that
you don't trust yourself?

331
00:21:08.641 --> 00:21:11.905
Oh, great. So, if God's got
a plan, I'm covered. Right?

332
00:21:11.948 --> 00:21:14.971
I should've just stayed in bed, because
for all I know it's part of his plan.

333
00:21:14.995 --> 00:21:17.650
That's not what I'm
saying and you know it.

334
00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:20.740
All right. Look here.
Chess. Right?

335
00:21:20.783 --> 00:21:22.872
Pieces interact.
There's rules.Mm-hmm.

336
00:21:22.916 --> 00:21:24.526
There's give and take.

337
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.486
But no two pieces can occupy the
same space at the same time.

338
00:21:27.529 --> 00:21:29.879
That's a lot like
you and me.

339
00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:31.620
People make choices,

340
00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:34.057
and those choices
have consequences.

341
00:21:34.101 --> 00:21:37.626
And if knowing my will were
part of every human decision,

342
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.846
how would anything
ever happen, hmm?

343
00:21:40.847 --> 00:21:42.979
You'd be paralyzed
every morning,

344
00:21:43.023 --> 00:21:46.940
trying to decide whether to brush your
teeth vertically or horizontally.

345
00:21:46.983 --> 00:21:50.770
So, trying to know God's will
is, what, a waste of time? No. Not at all.

346
00:21:50.813 --> 00:21:53.381
Paul, I'm only telling you
what you already know.

347
00:21:55.514 --> 00:21:57.820
You have to make
your own choices,

348
00:21:57.864 --> 00:22:00.170
and you have to live
by those choices,

349
00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:02.782
no matter how
you arrived at them.

350
00:22:02.825 --> 00:22:03.913
Hmm.

351
00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:07.003
Tell me, when you
traveled to Afghanistan,

352
00:22:07.047 --> 00:22:09.179
which aspects of my will
did you consider?

353
00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:12.835
Or did you just think it's all my will,
so, hey, anything goes?

354
00:22:12.879 --> 00:22:17.100
Um, I think it was slightly
more complicated than that.

355
00:22:17.144 --> 00:22:20.495
You traveled 7,000 miles
into a war zone, Paul.

356
00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:23.063
War changes people.

357
00:22:23.106 --> 00:22:26.936
You had to have known a trip like
that would have consequences for you,

358
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.982
and for your family.

359
00:22:29.025 --> 00:22:31.985
Or did you think
that you'd be different?

360
00:22:36.206 --> 00:22:39.384
I guess I was hoping God
would look out for me.

361
00:22:39.427 --> 00:22:41.386
"Hoping"?

362
00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:43.039
Praying.

363
00:22:44.258 --> 00:22:45.999
I prayed for my own safety.

364
00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:49.219
I prayed God would watch over the
soldiers I'd met and bring them home.

365
00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:51.918
I prayed my wife would be
okay while I was gone.

366
00:22:51.961 --> 00:22:54.660
I prayed I didn't do anything stupid.
I prayed a lot.

367
00:22:54.703 --> 00:22:56.836
Were your prayers
answered?

368
00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:59.491
I don't know.
Some, yes. Mostly, no.

369
00:23:00.622 --> 00:23:02.972
Would you like to
talk about that?

370
00:23:03.016 --> 00:23:05.410
Are you
the complaint department?

371
00:23:05.453 --> 00:23:08.021
I heard I was needed,
so I came.

372
00:23:08.064 --> 00:23:10.458
So, I think I'm here
to do an interview,

373
00:23:10.502 --> 00:23:13.069
but really what this is
is an intervention.

374
00:23:13.113 --> 00:23:15.637
Yes, but not in the way
you think it is.

375
00:23:15.681 --> 00:23:17.770
How do you know
what I think?

376
00:23:21.774 --> 00:23:23.776
Let's save that
for tomorrow.

377
00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:27.910
This is
a weird interview.Yeah.

378
00:23:27.954 --> 00:23:30.783
Okay, let's just call it a conversation.
Would that be better?

379
00:23:30.826 --> 00:23:33.568
Sorry. That's not
why they pay me.

380
00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:36.441
Oh. And that's why you're here.
For money.

381
00:23:36.484 --> 00:23:38.573
Why are we here?

382
00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.706
I heard I was needed,
so I came.

383
00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:43.099
A simple "thank you"
would suffice.

384
00:23:43.143 --> 00:23:46.276
Why do I deserve
your special attention?

385
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.843
Don't you?

386
00:23:47.887 --> 00:23:50.280
So you're here
to save me.

387
00:23:50.324 --> 00:23:51.978
Do you need saving?

388
00:23:52.021 --> 00:23:53.414
Doesn't everyone?

389
00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:56.112
Yes.

390
00:23:56.156 --> 00:23:58.854
But we're gonna do something
a little different this time.

391
00:23:58.898 --> 00:24:00.595
Oh? I'm gonna help you.

392
00:24:00.639 --> 00:24:02.684
You're gonna help me? Mm-hmm.

393
00:24:03.555 --> 00:24:05.818
I don't understand. I know.

394
00:24:07.297 --> 00:24:09.169
I know.

395
00:24:09.212 --> 00:24:10.953
But, uh, you will.

396
00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:14.261
And so...

397
00:24:14.304 --> 00:24:15.828
We're out of time.

398
00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:18.961
All right.

399
00:24:20.136 --> 00:24:21.964
Uh, see you tomorrow?

400
00:24:22.748 --> 00:24:24.489
Sure.
Same time and place?

401
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:26.839
Well,
to be determined.

402
00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:34.020
Seriously.
What's all this about?

403
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.676
Uh, let's talk tomorrow.

404
00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.958
- Yeah.
- Um... Paul Asher.

405
00:28:37.002 --> 00:28:39.265
Hey, it's me.

406
00:28:39.308 --> 00:28:41.833
Oh, uh, hi.

407
00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:43.791
So, what happened
this morning?

408
00:28:43.835 --> 00:28:45.227
Did she leave?

409
00:28:46.794 --> 00:28:49.710
I don't know.
Um... I don't know.

410
00:28:49.754 --> 00:28:51.799
Oh.

411
00:28:51.843 --> 00:28:54.280
You sound a little, um...
I'm sorry. I had...

412
00:28:54.323 --> 00:28:58.110
I just got into work.
I had a weird, strange morning.

413
00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:01.504
Can I see you later?

414
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.812
Paul?
You there?

415
00:29:08.337 --> 00:29:09.774
Oh. Oh.

416
00:29:09.817 --> 00:29:11.732
Hey, uh,
can I call you later?

417
00:29:11.776 --> 00:29:14.126
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

418
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:16.171
Promise? Yeah. Will do.
Okay.

419
00:29:16.215 --> 00:29:18.260
Paul... Okay. Thanks.
Talk to you soon.

420
00:29:18.304 --> 00:29:19.522
Okay. Bye. Bye.

421
00:29:19.566 --> 00:29:21.611
Hey. Gary.

422
00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:22.961
Yeah, hey.

423
00:29:25.702 --> 00:29:27.574
What are you
doing here?

424
00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:31.099
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, uh...

425
00:29:31.143 --> 00:29:33.275
And yet,
here you are.

426
00:29:33.928 --> 00:29:36.626
You know, paid leave

427
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.803
means we still pay you,
right?

428
00:29:38.846 --> 00:29:41.588
Yes.
HR explained that.

429
00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:45.070
And how much time have you
taken off since you got back?

430
00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:48.116
Mmm...

431
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.771
I think the answer you're looking for is
"none."

432
00:29:50.815 --> 00:29:52.294
Paul.

433
00:29:55.515 --> 00:29:57.169
Hmm.

434
00:29:57.952 --> 00:29:59.867
So, you know

435
00:29:59.911 --> 00:30:02.348
there is no shame
in taking some time.

436
00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:04.916
Right?

437
00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.482
Yeah. Thanks.

438
00:30:06.526 --> 00:30:09.007
Uh, but I needed to...
Did you get my text?

439
00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.531
You trying to
change the subject? Yeah.

440
00:30:11.574 --> 00:30:13.272
It work?

441
00:30:13.315 --> 00:30:15.622
Yeah, I got it.
Everything okay? Yeah, all good.

442
00:30:15.665 --> 00:30:19.060
Just a crazy morning.
I'm working on something.

443
00:30:19.104 --> 00:30:21.541
That's not what I meant.

444
00:30:21.584 --> 00:30:24.587
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm good.
Thanks.

445
00:30:26.372 --> 00:30:27.982
Mm-hmm.

446
00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:31.290
What about Sarah? Family?
What's she up to?

447
00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:33.161
She's good.

448
00:30:33.205 --> 00:30:35.207
Yeah? Yeah.
I'll tell her you asked.

449
00:30:37.209 --> 00:30:39.515
Hey, Gary,
excuse me. Tell her I say hi.

450
00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:41.648
Can you just
sign right here?

451
00:30:41.691 --> 00:30:43.215
Yeah.

452
00:30:44.477 --> 00:30:45.870
And here.Mm-hmm.

453
00:30:45.913 --> 00:30:47.480
Send it out. Thank you.

454
00:30:47.523 --> 00:30:48.916
Yeah.

455
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.397
So, what do you need?

456
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.877
What do you mean?

457
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.575
Yeah... Oh.

458
00:30:55.618 --> 00:30:57.533
Your text
this morning.

459
00:30:57.577 --> 00:30:59.144
Yeah.

460
00:30:59.187 --> 00:31:00.493
Um...

461
00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:04.714
I have this friend
and he needs some help.

462
00:31:04.758 --> 00:31:06.455
Mmm. A friend.
Really?

463
00:31:06.499 --> 00:31:10.416
Wow. No, it's not me.
It's a guy I met overseas.

464
00:31:10.459 --> 00:31:12.940
He's having trouble
since he got back.

465
00:31:12.984 --> 00:31:15.595
- PTSD?
- I think so.

466
00:31:15.638 --> 00:31:17.945
Okay. Yeah.

467
00:31:17.989 --> 00:31:20.817
- Is he gonna be okay?
- I hope so.

468
00:31:20.861 --> 00:31:24.169
I think sometimes it's just
hard to see God's plan

469
00:31:24.212 --> 00:31:26.171
in the middle of a war,
you know.

470
00:31:26.214 --> 00:31:28.390
Yeah.
So, what can I do to help?

471
00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:33.613
He needs to talk to someone right away,
someone professional.

472
00:31:33.656 --> 00:31:35.136
I told him I'd ask around.

473
00:31:36.268 --> 00:31:38.487
He's a good guy.
A war hero.

474
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:39.967
Do you know anyone?

475
00:31:40.011 --> 00:31:42.230
He can't go
to the VA?

476
00:31:42.274 --> 00:31:44.493
Well... I mean, that's
what it's there for.

477
00:31:44.537 --> 00:31:47.975
He's got a classified job now, so it could
be a problem if people think he's...

478
00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:49.977
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Yeah.

479
00:31:50.891 --> 00:31:52.588
Well...

480
00:31:52.632 --> 00:31:56.288
I know somebody over at the
Interfaith Center who's pretty good.

481
00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:59.291
She's really good.
I went to her myself when Ann left me.

482
00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:03.991
- When was this?
- Last year.

483
00:32:06.211 --> 00:32:07.734
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

484
00:32:07.777 --> 00:32:10.302
Ah, well, I didn't advertise,
and you were...

485
00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:13.000
gone for most of it,
so...

486
00:32:13.044 --> 00:32:14.523
You never said anything.

487
00:32:14.567 --> 00:32:16.699
You were fine.
You... You seemed fine.

488
00:32:16.743 --> 00:32:18.266
Yeah, see,
that's the thing.

489
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.661
Sometimes there aren't signs
when someone's in trouble.

490
00:32:21.704 --> 00:32:24.794
So it's really good that your friend,
this, um...

491
00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:26.883
Matt.Matt...

492
00:32:26.927 --> 00:32:28.885
is reaching out
to you like this.

493
00:32:28.929 --> 00:32:30.235
Yeah.

494
00:32:30.278 --> 00:32:33.499
- So I'll ask and get you a name.
- Okay. Thanks.

495
00:32:33.542 --> 00:32:36.458
You know I got your back.
Right? You know that? Yeah. I do.

496
00:32:36.502 --> 00:32:38.025
Okay.

497
00:32:38.069 --> 00:32:39.635
What are you
working on?

498
00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:42.160
Oh. Uh, you're not
gonna believe this.

499
00:32:42.203 --> 00:32:43.813
Um... I'm doing
an interview.

500
00:32:43.857 --> 00:32:46.077
Okay.
With who?

501
00:32:51.821 --> 00:32:53.214
With God.

502
00:32:56.783 --> 00:32:58.654
Really?

503
00:32:58.698 --> 00:33:00.526
Yeah. Yeah.
Really.

504
00:33:02.832 --> 00:33:05.618
I love it.
That's a great idea.

505
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:08.534
You like it? Because I was
starting to have second thoughts.

506
00:33:08.577 --> 00:33:11.450
No, no, no, no, no.
For your blog?

507
00:33:11.493 --> 00:33:14.627
Or maybe this could be
something bigger.

508
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.629
I don't know.
What do you mean, something bigger?

509
00:33:16.672 --> 00:33:20.850
Print edition, column four.
Human interest, every Thursday.

510
00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:23.070
Yes. Yes.

511
00:33:23.114 --> 00:33:26.117
The front page.
Y-Y... You're kidding.

512
00:33:27.074 --> 00:33:28.945
About time God
made the front page.

513
00:33:28.989 --> 00:33:30.730
You disagree?

514
00:33:30.773 --> 00:33:32.036
No, of course not.Okay.

515
00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.646
But what will
the office think?

516
00:33:33.689 --> 00:33:36.692
You don't think it'll cause
some resentment around here?

517
00:33:36.736 --> 00:33:38.216
No, not really.

518
00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:40.479
I think they already
resent you.Okay.

519
00:33:40.522 --> 00:33:42.872
Thank you. How many words?

520
00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:44.918
No idea.

521
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:48.487
Okay, okay, uh... This is gonna be good.
This is great.

522
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.403
Okay, for now,

523
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:53.535
we'll keep this
between us, yeah?

524
00:33:53.579 --> 00:33:55.189
Yeah. No problem. Let me work on it.

525
00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.582
Okay.

526
00:33:57.931 --> 00:33:59.802
Interview with God.

527
00:34:01.369 --> 00:34:03.589
That's very cool.
Very cool.

528
00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:26.916
Hi. This is Sarah.

529
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.310
Leave a message at the beepy thing,
and have a great day.

530
00:34:29.354 --> 00:34:31.834
Hey, Sarah, it's me.

531
00:34:33.009 --> 00:34:35.838
Um... I wanna
finish our talk.

532
00:34:40.016 --> 00:34:41.844
I think
we can fix this.

533
00:34:43.019 --> 00:34:45.109
Please call me back.

534
00:34:45.152 --> 00:34:46.806
Okay. Bye.

535
00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:02.778
Is God love?

536
00:35:05.216 --> 00:35:07.479
He doesn't boast,
but yes, absolutely.

537
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.048
What's 2,427 times 648?

538
00:35:12.092 --> 00:35:17.010
1,572,696.

539
00:35:17.053 --> 00:35:18.968
Six hundred...

540
00:35:21.928 --> 00:35:23.321
For real?

541
00:35:25.888 --> 00:35:29.631
1,572,696.

542
00:35:34.506 --> 00:35:35.637
Huh.

543
00:36:30.562 --> 00:36:31.737
Sarah?

544
00:37:10.819 --> 00:37:13.257
I know who you are.

545
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.171
I know all your work. I'm a fan.

546
00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:19.219
Christians in combat? That must
have been a tough assignment.

547
00:37:19.263 --> 00:37:21.395
Tough on you. Tough on your family.

548
00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:24.746
You traveled 7,000 miles
into a war zone, Paul.

549
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:28.141
War changes people. You're gonna help me?

550
00:37:28.184 --> 00:37:29.751
I don't understand.

551
00:37:29.795 --> 00:37:32.195
Getting back to my question,
is that why you're here?

552
00:37:32.232 --> 00:37:33.799
Am I a prophet? But, Paul...

553
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.411
bad things do happen to
some very good people.

554
00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:40.588
I just think you of all people should
know why my answers might be...

555
00:37:40.632 --> 00:37:42.764
Is the problem that you
don't trust God's plan?

556
00:37:42.808 --> 00:37:46.290
Or is the problem that you
don't trust yourself?

557
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:57.649
I'm God. G-O-D.

558
00:37:57.692 --> 00:37:59.694
That reminds me of an old joke.

559
00:37:59.738 --> 00:38:01.522
Seriously. What's all this about?

560
00:38:01.566 --> 00:38:03.935
What exactly would you like to see
burst into flames? Am I a prophet?

561
00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:06.614
This is not about me. Really?
People make choices.

562
00:38:06.658 --> 00:38:08.790
Why are we here? Those
choices have consequences.

563
00:38:08.834 --> 00:38:10.357
So, you're here to save me?

564
00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:13.404
If knowing my will were
part of every human decision,

565
00:38:13.447 --> 00:38:15.144
how would anything get done?

566
00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:17.209
When you traveled
to Afghanistan... Which aspects...

567
00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:20.236
You of all people should know... And
I also know about your marriage.

568
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.675
So, if God's got a plan, I'm covered,
right? I also know about your marriage.

569
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.981
- Can we talk later tonight, please?
- I'm not sure.

570
00:38:26.025 --> 00:38:28.177
When trust in a marriage has
been broken, how do you fix it?

571
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:30.440
How many times do you want me to apologize?
Stop apologizing.

572
00:38:30.464 --> 00:38:32.510
I don't care about the dishes!

573
00:39:04.455 --> 00:39:06.065
You never know.

574
00:39:15.901 --> 00:39:18.860
Sarah?

575
00:39:26.825 --> 00:39:27.913
Hello?

576
00:39:32.352 --> 00:39:33.571
Who's there?

577
00:39:39.054 --> 00:39:41.013
Hello?

578
00:39:41.056 --> 00:39:42.449
Hello!

579
00:39:44.103 --> 00:39:45.583
Who's there?

580
00:39:45.626 --> 00:39:47.759
Shut up!

581
00:39:58.291 --> 00:40:00.467
Morning.

582
00:40:00.511 --> 00:40:01.903
Morning.

583
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.038
Sarah staying home
today? Yeah.

584
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.997
Under the weather?

585
00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:10.651
Uh, yeah, I think so.

586
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.959
Echinacea.

587
00:40:14.002 --> 00:40:16.048
That's what I use.

588
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:17.528
I'll tell her.

589
00:40:47.427 --> 00:40:49.255
Hello?

590
00:40:53.564 --> 00:40:55.522
Hello?

591
00:41:29.164 --> 00:41:30.296
You work here?

592
00:41:32.385 --> 00:41:33.995
Why do you ask?

593
00:41:37.042 --> 00:41:39.000
My mom worked here.

594
00:41:39.044 --> 00:41:40.175
Long ago.

595
00:41:42.569 --> 00:41:44.571
Should we even
be in here?

596
00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:47.705
Come.
Join me.

597
00:42:05.549 --> 00:42:08.160
Oh, you don't look
so good today, Paul.

598
00:42:09.596 --> 00:42:12.164
Is everything okay? I'm fine.

599
00:42:14.514 --> 00:42:16.734
What happened
to your hand?

600
00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.085
We should get started.

601
00:42:20.128 --> 00:42:24.829
Uh, we can skip today and finish tomorrow,
if that would be better.

602
00:42:24.872 --> 00:42:27.309
No, that's okay.
I'm here. You're here.

603
00:42:27.353 --> 00:42:30.312
Let's just, uh, pick it up
where we left off and...

604
00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.359
make it a good interview.

605
00:42:33.402 --> 00:42:36.841
Actually, you didn't look
so good yesterday either.

606
00:42:36.884 --> 00:42:38.756
I'm, uh...
I'm a little worried.

607
00:42:39.713 --> 00:42:41.628
About yesterday,
we got off track.

608
00:42:41.672 --> 00:42:44.762
I was trying to be professional,
but we got off track. I apologize for that.

609
00:42:44.805 --> 00:42:46.415
No apologies necessary.

610
00:42:46.459 --> 00:42:49.462
You were incredibly professional,
and I said so.

611
00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:51.986
Thank you,
but somehow I became part of the interview,

612
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.510
and that's not
supposed to happen.

613
00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:57.426
So let's get back
to you and, uh...

614
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.341
make it
a good interview.

615
00:43:10.396 --> 00:43:11.789
Shall we?

616
00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:14.618
Okay, recording.

617
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:16.968
June 2. Paul Asher
interviewing God.

618
00:43:22.974 --> 00:43:26.542
So, I think we covered most
of the basics yesterday.

619
00:43:26.586 --> 00:43:29.502
Uh, where did we leave off? You
were asking me why I was here.

620
00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:32.374
Right. Sorry. Uh, so why are you here?
Why an interview?

621
00:43:32.418 --> 00:43:35.682
I'd like to talk to you
about salvation, Paul.

622
00:43:35.726 --> 00:43:38.337
Okay. Good topic.
This is progress.

623
00:43:39.338 --> 00:43:41.557
Salvation.

624
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:45.170
What do you mean by that? What do you think
I mean by that?

625
00:43:47.912 --> 00:43:49.696
I'm not trying
to be difficult,

626
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.004
but we should establish what you
think it is before we can discuss it.

627
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:56.137
Right? Salvation means different
things to different people.

628
00:43:56.181 --> 00:43:57.791
Yes, it does.
It's very personal.

629
00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:59.793
It is the most personal,
and in the end...

630
00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.840
and I mean,
literally in the end,

631
00:44:02.883 --> 00:44:05.407
there's nothing more personal
than salvation.

632
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:07.453
It's just you and your soul.

633
00:44:07.496 --> 00:44:10.064
Can't get more intimate
than that. Hard to argue.

634
00:44:10.108 --> 00:44:12.763
So when I ask you,
what do you think it is,

635
00:44:12.806 --> 00:44:15.461
it's only to help me answer
your questions properly.

636
00:44:15.504 --> 00:44:19.421
That's why we're here. Right?
You ask. I answer.

637
00:44:20.509 --> 00:44:22.163
Okay.

638
00:44:22.207 --> 00:44:25.166
Salvation means different things
to different people.Mm-hmm.

639
00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:28.474
But I'm a Christian,
so let me answer it from that perspective.

640
00:44:28.517 --> 00:44:31.129
Salvation is returning to a state
of perfection with the Almighty

641
00:44:31.172 --> 00:44:32.870
and absolution from sin
forever.

642
00:44:32.913 --> 00:44:35.350
Excellent.
That's a very good definition.

643
00:44:35.394 --> 00:44:38.223
Yes, you got right to
the heart of the matter. Thank you.

644
00:44:38.266 --> 00:44:41.008
But you sidestepped several
thousand years of disagreement

645
00:44:41.052 --> 00:44:43.054
over how
you actually get there.

646
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:45.970
I'm with Jesus,
so I'm covered, thanks.Oh.

647
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:49.625
Are you sure
about that? What does that mean?

648
00:44:49.669 --> 00:44:51.497
Nothing.
I'm... I'm just asking.

649
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.847
As I said,
I'd like this interview to be about you.

650
00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:57.503
I answered your question, so...
salvation.

651
00:44:57.546 --> 00:44:59.026
Salvation. Okay.

652
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.551
So, for the sake of...
for the sake of discussion,

653
00:45:02.595 --> 00:45:07.382
let's pretend that I am a
manufacturer and you are a consumer,

654
00:45:07.426 --> 00:45:11.386
and you tell me,
how would you rate the product.

655
00:45:15.086 --> 00:45:17.175
Salvation
as the product?

656
00:45:18.611 --> 00:45:22.006
You've gotta be
kidding me. No, I'm not kidding.

657
00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:24.399
Just pretend
that it's market research.

658
00:45:24.443 --> 00:45:26.837
You've done this many times before,
I'm sure.

659
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.795
It's just another
online survey.

660
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.972
How do you rate
the product?

661
00:45:35.106 --> 00:45:36.803
Okay.
Let's find out.

662
00:45:38.065 --> 00:45:40.589
On the one hand,
it's the greatest product ever.

663
00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:42.330
Redemption from sin?

664
00:45:42.374 --> 00:45:45.420
Reunification with God for eternity
after a lifetime on earth? Wow!

665
00:45:45.464 --> 00:45:48.530
Who wouldn't want that product? If that
doesn't sell itself, nothing ever will.

666
00:45:48.554 --> 00:45:51.122
Well, I'm glad you approve.

667
00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.994
On the other hand... On the other hand,
what?

668
00:45:54.038 --> 00:45:56.431
On the other hand,
it's the only product I can think of

669
00:45:56.475 --> 00:45:59.260
where proper use involves
returning it to the maker.

670
00:45:59.304 --> 00:46:01.828
And there's really only
one way that can happen.

671
00:46:01.872 --> 00:46:03.569
Everybody wants to
get to heaven...

672
00:46:03.612 --> 00:46:05.789
But no one wants to die.
Exactly.

673
00:46:05.832 --> 00:46:10.445
That slight complication is mitigated
by the fact that everyone will die.

674
00:46:10.489 --> 00:46:13.666
So it's really just about the when...
the product... not the what.

675
00:46:13.709 --> 00:46:15.755
Oh, I knew
you'd be good at this.

676
00:46:15.799 --> 00:46:18.192
Yeah. I should've been
a marketing major.

677
00:46:18.236 --> 00:46:20.978
So, moving on... But, uh, what else?

678
00:46:23.371 --> 00:46:24.808
Really?

679
00:46:24.851 --> 00:46:26.679
There's one aspect
that you left out,

680
00:46:26.722 --> 00:46:29.595
the one that I mentioned
in the first place... the how.

681
00:46:29.638 --> 00:46:32.685
Or we can call it instructions,
just to stay with our metaphor.

682
00:46:32.728 --> 00:46:35.819
Okay, but really, after this,
we have to move on.

683
00:46:35.862 --> 00:46:37.168
Okay.

684
00:46:39.474 --> 00:46:42.173
Okay, well,
uh, the instructions.

685
00:46:43.565 --> 00:46:46.481
The instructions are widely available,
so that's good.

686
00:46:46.525 --> 00:46:50.137
Um, the Bible's a best seller
year after year, but...

687
00:46:50.181 --> 00:46:51.835
But...

688
00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:55.229
I think the instructions
are a little confusing.

689
00:46:55.273 --> 00:46:58.232
Well, no one ever said knowing
my will would be easy. Right.

690
00:46:58.276 --> 00:47:00.539
But knowing God's will isn't
really the problem, is it?

691
00:47:00.582 --> 00:47:03.020
The scriptures
are full of rules. Yes, they are.

692
00:47:03.063 --> 00:47:05.892
I can think of ten
just off the top of my head.

693
00:47:05.936 --> 00:47:07.981
Right, but that's the Old Testament,
the Torah.

694
00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:09.635
The New Testament
is different.

695
00:47:09.678 --> 00:47:12.116
God gave us his son.
That was a game-changer. Indeed it was.

696
00:47:12.159 --> 00:47:14.422
Jesus was super-clear.
John 14:6.

697
00:47:14.466 --> 00:47:17.077
"I am the way.
No one comes to the Father but through me."

698
00:47:17.121 --> 00:47:18.383
Seems very clear to me.

699
00:47:18.426 --> 00:47:19.993
But that
can't be right. No?

700
00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:22.996
Because
everyone's a sinner.Yes.

701
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.870
If we're saved through faith and faith alone,
why would anyone follow all the other rules?

702
00:47:26.913 --> 00:47:28.654
But is faith
all it takes?

703
00:47:28.697 --> 00:47:31.178
You're a murderer. So what?
Liar? No problem.

704
00:47:31.222 --> 00:47:33.180
Philanderer?
Hey, everyone makes mistakes.

705
00:47:33.224 --> 00:47:36.227
So what's the problem? The problem is...

706
00:47:40.144 --> 00:47:41.623
The problem is...

707
00:47:42.798 --> 00:47:44.365
The problem is what,
Paul? Sorry.

708
00:47:44.409 --> 00:47:46.933
This keeps happening.
I'm not the story. We agreed.

709
00:47:46.977 --> 00:47:49.675
Check the record.
I never agreed to that.

710
00:47:51.546 --> 00:47:54.810
What do you want? I mean, really.
What is this all about?

711
00:47:54.854 --> 00:47:58.118
It seems like you want something from me.
I have no idea what it is.

712
00:47:58.162 --> 00:48:01.774
Now you see why the burning bush
worked so well. I talk, people listen.

713
00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:03.428
I agreed to meet with you

714
00:48:03.471 --> 00:48:06.387
because it was an intriguing prospect,
an idea for an interview,

715
00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:08.955
and I think I have given you
the benefit of the doubt.

716
00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:11.958
But it's clear to me now you had
some other hidden agenda for this.

717
00:48:12.002 --> 00:48:15.788
This, whatever this is. Really, give me
something. What do you want from me?

718
00:48:15.831 --> 00:48:17.964
My math skills
didn't impress you?

719
00:48:18.008 --> 00:48:20.793
No, that was impressive,
but there are people who can do that stuff.

720
00:48:20.836 --> 00:48:22.099
Okay. Savants, I guess.

721
00:48:22.142 --> 00:48:25.058
Right. Okay.
I'll give you something.

722
00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:28.627
But you may not like it. Ah, finally.

723
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.629
Okay, hit me. All right.

724
00:48:30.672 --> 00:48:35.764
No offense, but I think you have a
misunderstanding about the nature of faith.

725
00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:39.290
I don't think that's true.
I told you I've always had faith.

726
00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:40.682
There it is.

727
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.208
You see?

728
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:47.733
"I've always had faith."

729
00:48:47.776 --> 00:48:50.127
Paul, do you see
what I mean?

730
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:52.129
No, not really.
What are you saying?

731
00:48:53.043 --> 00:48:55.436
Okay, we'll get back to that.

732
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.440
Paul, do you...
do you ever think

733
00:48:59.484 --> 00:49:02.704
of what the world is like
from my perspective?

734
00:49:05.403 --> 00:49:08.710
From God's
perspective? Mm-hmm.

735
00:49:09.711 --> 00:49:11.235
Frankly, no.

736
00:49:11.278 --> 00:49:13.498
How would I even do that?
How would that be possible?

737
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:15.804
Well, fair enough.

738
00:49:15.848 --> 00:49:20.635
But, uh, try to imagine
knowing every human deed,

739
00:49:20.679 --> 00:49:26.163
every thought, aspiration,
uh, depravity.

740
00:49:27.338 --> 00:49:30.689
But also knowing
all the, uh, isolation

741
00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:34.736
and the... the pain
and the emptiness of life.

742
00:49:36.347 --> 00:49:40.525
Now, multiply that times every
human soul that ever existed.

743
00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:45.051
I wouldn't want that job. Why not?

744
00:49:48.054 --> 00:49:50.535
Because it would
be overwhelming.

745
00:49:50.578 --> 00:49:53.625
The world is full
of such terrible things.

746
00:49:53.668 --> 00:49:56.454
I work for a newspaper.
I see it every day.

747
00:49:56.497 --> 00:49:57.890
Horrible things.

748
00:49:57.933 --> 00:50:01.676
Things that come crashing
down on decent people.

749
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.854
People with dignity who only want
to know why it's happening to them.

750
00:50:05.898 --> 00:50:07.595
What would I say to them?

751
00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:09.684
"Trust me"?

752
00:50:09.728 --> 00:50:11.686
"I have a plan"?

753
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.341
No, thanks.

754
00:50:14.385 --> 00:50:18.867
All that misery in the world
would break my heart.

755
00:50:18.911 --> 00:50:20.826
Mm-hmm.

756
00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:23.089
But tell me,

757
00:50:23.133 --> 00:50:24.786
why would you care?

758
00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:29.095
All right,
what do you mean, why?

759
00:50:29.139 --> 00:50:31.054
Why would it
break your heart?

760
00:50:32.055 --> 00:50:34.100
Because I care.

761
00:50:34.144 --> 00:50:36.581
I have compassion
for my fellow human beings.

762
00:50:36.624 --> 00:50:39.149
And where does
that morality come from?

763
00:50:40.411 --> 00:50:42.804
I'm sure the answer you're
looking for is "from God,"

764
00:50:42.848 --> 00:50:44.980
but, really, I have no idea.

765
00:50:45.024 --> 00:50:49.028
Free will perhaps, Paul?
Hmm?

766
00:50:49.072 --> 00:50:51.770
Free will exists.

767
00:50:51.813 --> 00:50:55.078
And it wouldn't be much of a morality
if I forced you to have it, Paul.

768
00:50:55.121 --> 00:50:57.210
Okay. Good to know.
It's all me.

769
00:50:57.254 --> 00:51:00.561
So, when do we get
to the part I won't like?

770
00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:04.043
Paul, if you think
faith is enough...

771
00:51:04.087 --> 00:51:07.133
I mean, it's not,
but if you do,

772
00:51:07.177 --> 00:51:09.918
would you just start
being an immoral person?

773
00:51:09.962 --> 00:51:12.747
How do you know I'm not an immoral person?
Because you just told me.

774
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:15.141
You said you have compassion,
and I believe you.

775
00:51:16.534 --> 00:51:18.362
So, what could you
possibly do

776
00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:21.278
that would be beyond my
powers to forgive you?

777
00:51:33.464 --> 00:51:36.423
Paul, I just asked you
a very important question.

778
00:51:36.467 --> 00:51:39.296
I, uh... I don't want
to talk about this.

779
00:51:39.339 --> 00:51:41.167
Can we change the subject,
please?

780
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:42.950
Why?

781
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:49.784
Why?
Because it's personal.

782
00:51:49.828 --> 00:51:51.545
But you have
no secrets from me. Yeah, I do.

783
00:51:51.569 --> 00:51:53.962
No, you don't.Yeah, I do.

784
00:51:54.006 --> 00:51:56.139
And my life is not the topic
of this conversation.

785
00:51:56.182 --> 00:51:59.533
But it really is, Paul. I don't know
how many more ways I can say this.

786
00:51:59.577 --> 00:52:01.709
But you need to
start hearing me.Okay.

787
00:52:01.753 --> 00:52:04.190
We've done enough for today.
Thank you. All right, all right.

788
00:52:04.234 --> 00:52:06.149
You can ask me
anything you want.

789
00:52:06.192 --> 00:52:09.500
That's what I've been doing,
but it doesn't really get me anywhere.

790
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:12.024
I've been more than deferential
to your claim of who you are,

791
00:52:12.067 --> 00:52:15.158
but I keep asking questions, and you
keep giving me these evasive answers.

792
00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:16.724
You've been asking
very good questions,

793
00:52:16.768 --> 00:52:18.354
and I'm trying to answer them
as best I can.

794
00:52:18.378 --> 00:52:20.598
Best for who? For you, of course.

795
00:52:20.641 --> 00:52:22.924
If that's what you think,
then we did get to the part I don't like.

796
00:52:22.948 --> 00:52:25.907
Well, it can get a lot worse than that.
I really don't see how.

797
00:52:25.951 --> 00:52:29.998
Well, how about we talk
about your marriage? No!

798
00:52:30.042 --> 00:52:34.220
No, we really can't, and it's inappropriate
you would bring that into the conversation!

799
00:52:34.264 --> 00:52:36.440
My personal life
is off-limits,

800
00:52:36.483 --> 00:52:38.181
and that goes double
for my marriage.

801
00:52:38.224 --> 00:52:40.835
Oh, and you're sure
about that?

802
00:52:40.879 --> 00:52:42.924
Are you...

803
00:52:42.968 --> 00:52:45.188
Did someone put you up to this?
Is that...?

804
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:46.928
Paul, you're just
being paranoid.

805
00:52:46.972 --> 00:52:50.193
- I'm just here to help.
- Thanks, but I can manage my own affairs.

806
00:52:50.236 --> 00:52:52.847
Oh, you can? I can manage!

807
00:52:52.891 --> 00:52:57.330
Why are you doing this?
Is this what you do to people?

808
00:52:57.374 --> 00:53:00.246
Is this what you do?
Go around talking crap?

809
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.162
Why am I here?

810
00:53:03.206 --> 00:53:06.034
Oh, I get that question
too many times. I mean, here.

811
00:53:06.078 --> 00:53:08.123
In this theater.
Why am I here?

812
00:53:08.167 --> 00:53:11.344
'Cause I would like to help
you if you will let me.

813
00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:13.781
Thanks. I've got it covered.
Everything's under control.

814
00:53:13.825 --> 00:53:17.481
Oh, okay then. Yeah.
Well, that's... that's very good to hear

815
00:53:17.524 --> 00:53:20.484
because, uh, you are
about out of time.

816
00:53:20.527 --> 00:53:23.878
Oh, I had five more minutes, but I'm happy
to forfeit that time to the next prophet.

817
00:53:23.922 --> 00:53:27.404
No, Paul. I mean, you
are about out of time.

818
00:53:28.666 --> 00:53:30.842
- What are you saying?
- Just that.

819
00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.281
Out of time. That's cryptic.
What does that even mean?

820
00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:52.733
- You're saying...
- Yes.

821
00:54:02.613 --> 00:54:04.745
- Are you saying...?
- Yes.

822
00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:07.270
I'm very sorry.

823
00:54:10.447 --> 00:54:13.754
- This is a joke.
- No. No joke, Paul.

824
00:54:14.886 --> 00:54:16.017
I'm sorry.

825
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:19.325
Sick joke.

826
00:54:21.327 --> 00:54:22.807
Why would you
tell me that?

827
00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:28.508
Because you said so
yourself, Paul.

828
00:54:28.552 --> 00:54:31.511
Dying is just about
the when.

829
00:54:31.555 --> 00:54:33.774
So why can't the when
be now?

830
00:54:33.818 --> 00:54:36.342
This interview is over. Well, we...
we still have tomorrow.

831
00:54:36.386 --> 00:54:38.083
There is no tomorrow!

832
00:54:38.126 --> 00:54:40.446
I'll let you know where,
just in case you change your mind.

833
00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:44.872
I'm pretty sure I won't.
I don't even know why I agreed to this.

834
00:54:44.916 --> 00:54:47.135
You prayed, Paul.
You asked for help.

835
00:54:47.179 --> 00:54:49.834
That's why I'm here,
and I thought an interview would be a place

836
00:54:49.877 --> 00:54:52.010
where a journalist
would be comfortable.

837
00:54:52.053 --> 00:54:55.187
Well, congratulations.
You got that exactly wrong.

838
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.058
I'm not comfortable
at all with this.

839
00:54:57.102 --> 00:54:59.496
Salvation is real,
Paul,

840
00:54:59.539 --> 00:55:01.454
and it can still
happen for you,

841
00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:05.458
but you need to understand
something very important.

842
00:55:05.502 --> 00:55:07.721
Faith isn't something
that you can just have.

843
00:55:07.765 --> 00:55:09.593
Not in
the conventional sense.

844
00:55:09.636 --> 00:55:13.161
Because faith
isn't the goal.

845
00:55:13.205 --> 00:55:15.555
Faith is the process.

846
00:55:15.599 --> 00:55:17.427
It's a lot like a marriage.

847
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:21.126
The vows you take aren't the end.
They're just the beginning.

848
00:55:22.432 --> 00:55:25.957
It takes time and dedication...
every day.

849
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.439
Wow.

850
00:55:33.399 --> 00:55:34.879
Paul?

851
00:55:36.402 --> 00:55:37.969
Paul!

852
00:55:39.623 --> 00:55:42.582
Would you like to know
when it will happen?

853
00:55:46.369 --> 00:55:47.892
No.

854
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:17.590
Wh-What...
What are you doing here?

855
00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.418
You never called me back.

856
00:57:19.462 --> 00:57:21.289
Uh, yeah.

857
00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:24.945
I'm... I'm sorry.
I had a bad day yesterday, and...

858
00:57:24.989 --> 00:57:26.991
I know.
That's why I called you.

859
00:57:28.471 --> 00:57:31.909
Hey. Hello.
It's nice to see you.

860
00:57:33.258 --> 00:57:34.781
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hi.

861
00:57:34.825 --> 00:57:38.611
Uh, can we...
can we take this...

862
00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:41.048
Okay.

863
00:57:41.092 --> 00:57:43.486
Nobody knew where you were,
and you didn't answer your cell.

864
00:57:43.529 --> 00:57:46.837
I was in a meeting.
I had it turned off. I'm sorry. Uh...

865
00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.412
Do you want to talk
about yesterday?

866
00:57:57.456 --> 00:57:59.806
No, not really.

867
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:01.982
Don't you think we should?

868
00:58:02.722 --> 00:58:04.158
Okay, what's on your mind?

869
00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:07.597
Why are you talking
to me like that?

870
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:10.121
Like I'm other people.
She just left me yesterday.

871
00:58:10.164 --> 00:58:12.689
Can I get a... some breathing room?
Please?

872
00:58:12.732 --> 00:58:15.474
I know. I'm...
I'm just worried about you.

873
00:58:15.518 --> 00:58:18.346
I know. I'm sorry.
I know you are.

874
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:19.870
It's just...

875
00:58:21.611 --> 00:58:23.830
Do you want me to leave?

876
00:58:23.874 --> 00:58:26.485
Paul, you know this
wasn't your fault, right?

877
00:58:26.529 --> 00:58:29.270
It wasn't anyone's fault.

878
00:58:29.314 --> 00:58:31.664
Of course, it's my fault.

879
00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:34.580
Why does it have to
be someone's fault?

880
00:58:34.624 --> 00:58:37.017
Things happen in the universe,
Paul, in life.

881
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:39.672
Well, you know, I have a slightly
different perspective on that.

882
00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:43.981
I know, and it's one of the things
I've always loved about you.

883
00:58:44.024 --> 00:58:47.201
You have a strength and a
certainty that I've never had.

884
00:58:47.245 --> 00:58:49.421
But this...

885
00:58:49.464 --> 00:58:51.162
This was my fault.

886
00:58:51.205 --> 00:58:52.206
How?

887
00:58:53.468 --> 00:58:56.167
I never should have gone away.

888
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.777
Where?
To Afghanistan?

889
00:58:57.821 --> 00:59:00.388
It was stupid. I never thought it through,
what might happen.

890
00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:01.738
I was stupid.

891
00:59:01.781 --> 00:59:04.654
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, it's what I think.

892
00:59:05.568 --> 00:59:07.526
No, Paul.

893
00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:08.745
What?

894
00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:11.617
What?

895
00:59:11.661 --> 00:59:13.750
Sarah had the affair
before you left.

896
00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:28.155
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

897
00:59:28.199 --> 00:59:30.331
I thought you knew.
Give me a minute, please.

898
00:59:30.375 --> 00:59:33.421
Give me a minute.
Just give me some space! Please.

899
00:59:33.465 --> 00:59:35.554
Sorry. Oh!

900
00:59:35.598 --> 00:59:38.035
What's happening here?
Call you back.

901
00:59:38.078 --> 00:59:40.341
Whatever it is, why is it
happening in my office?

902
00:59:40.385 --> 00:59:43.257
I-I'm sorry. Hi.
I'm-I'm Grace.

903
00:59:43.301 --> 00:59:46.783
I'm Paul's sister-in-law.
Uh, Sarah's sister.

904
00:59:48.785 --> 00:59:50.482
Hi.A fan of your sister.

905
00:59:50.525 --> 00:59:53.528
Thanks. Uh, I'm sorry.

906
00:59:53.572 --> 00:59:55.443
We totally stole
your office.

907
00:59:55.487 --> 00:59:57.097
Yes, you did.

908
00:59:57.141 --> 00:59:59.447
Would you mind giving us
a couple of minutes?

909
00:59:59.491 --> 01:00:01.841
I'm sorry. Paul?

910
01:00:01.885 --> 01:00:03.887
Is that all right, Gary?

911
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:07.934
All right.
Hey, I got that name for your friend, okay?

912
01:00:07.978 --> 01:00:10.981
Number's right here.
They'll see him today if he can make it.

913
01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:14.854
- I'll leave it here.
- Thank you.

914
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:21.992
He doesn't know, huh?

915
01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:24.385
No.

916
01:00:24.429 --> 01:00:26.692
It might help if you start
talking to someone.

917
01:00:26.736 --> 01:00:28.476
If not me, someone else.

918
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.307
I want to talk to Sarah about it,
but she's not returning my calls.

919
01:00:33.351 --> 01:00:36.876
I don't even know where she is. For all I
know, she could be with that other guy.

920
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.965
No, she's... she's not.
She's not.

921
01:00:39.009 --> 01:00:41.664
That's over. How do you know?

922
01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:43.361
'Cause she's staying with me.

923
01:00:44.492 --> 01:00:45.755
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

924
01:00:45.798 --> 01:00:47.670
Paul, please.

925
01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:49.497
Could you please get her
to call me back?

926
01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:51.586
I can't. I'm sorry.

927
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:53.850
- You've got to be patient.
- Why?

928
01:00:53.893 --> 01:00:56.635
You just have to
give her time. Give her time?

929
01:00:56.679 --> 01:00:59.899
How much time?
A day? A week? A month?

930
01:00:59.943 --> 01:01:02.336
Paul, come on.
I've known you since I was 18.

931
01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.557
Sarah marrying you was
the best thing she ever did.

932
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.733
And we will always be family.

933
01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:09.866
That's why I'm here today.

934
01:01:09.909 --> 01:01:12.216
I-I don't know why
this happened, but...

935
01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:16.394
You should really
talk to someone.

936
01:01:16.437 --> 01:01:18.004
Yeah, I will.

937
01:01:18.048 --> 01:01:21.355
- Promise?
- I promise. Yeah.

938
01:01:21.399 --> 01:01:24.707
Yeah.
I appreciate you coming by. Thank you.

939
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.145
- Hug?
- Yeah.

940
01:01:44.465 --> 01:01:46.859
Hey, Matt. It's me.

941
01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.861
Yeah, that's why
I'm calling actually.

942
01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.776
You know what?
I'm going to text it to you.

943
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.345
They said if you can make it,
they'll see you right away. Today.

944
01:01:56.564 --> 01:01:58.088
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

945
01:02:00.177 --> 01:02:03.267
Okay. Good luck. Let me know how it goes.
Give me a call after.

946
01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.051
Okay?

947
01:02:05.095 --> 01:02:08.663
Um, can I ask for a favor?
A big favor?

948
01:02:08.707 --> 01:02:11.362
I'm doing this interview,
and it's getting kind of weird.

949
01:02:11.405 --> 01:02:12.929
Um...

950
01:02:12.972 --> 01:02:15.235
Well, that's the thing.
I-I don't know.

951
01:02:15.279 --> 01:02:17.760
If I send you a head shot,
could you check it out,

952
01:02:17.803 --> 01:02:19.544
run it through the database
or something?

953
01:02:19.587 --> 01:02:21.285
Is that possible?

954
01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.679
Really?

955
01:02:24.723 --> 01:02:27.595
No, that's perfect.
Tomorrow's fine.

956
01:02:27.639 --> 01:02:29.206
Okay. Bye.

957
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.427
What's going on?

958
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.996
Look, I'm sorry, Gary. What's wrong?

959
01:02:38.693 --> 01:02:40.521
Is there a problem
with the story?

960
01:02:43.655 --> 01:02:45.439
Talk to me.

961
01:02:46.484 --> 01:02:48.529
Sarah just left me.

962
01:02:48.573 --> 01:02:50.096
Yesterday.

963
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:52.925
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you say something?

964
01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.884
It's been bad
since I got back.

965
01:02:54.927 --> 01:02:57.756
I should have
said something.

966
01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.411
I don't know why.

967
01:03:00.454 --> 01:03:02.456
This about Afghanistan?

968
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.766
I thought so, but now I think it might
be a bigger problem, an older problem.

969
01:03:07.810 --> 01:03:09.637
I'm trying
to figure it out. All right.

970
01:03:09.681 --> 01:03:13.685
Well, maybe it's time you take
that break we talked about, huh?

971
01:03:13.728 --> 01:03:15.905
Yeah.

972
01:03:16.731 --> 01:03:19.169
Yeah. I might. Okay, good.

973
01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:21.475
You think you can
fix things with her?

974
01:03:21.519 --> 01:03:24.696
I don't know. Maybe I think
she's better off without me.

975
01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:26.654
Don't say that.

976
01:03:26.698 --> 01:03:28.569
Never think that.

977
01:03:37.056 --> 01:03:40.320
You know, when Ann left me,
I, uh... I went a little crazy.

978
01:03:40.364 --> 01:03:43.149
I had thoughts
I'd never had before.

979
01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:47.153
Crazy, weird thoughts.

980
01:03:47.197 --> 01:03:49.808
And then, you know,
maybe some of it was from,

981
01:03:49.852 --> 01:03:51.810
like, the body blow,
the hurt feelings.

982
01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:56.771
But the worst part of it for me was...
was this crushing disappointment.

983
01:03:56.815 --> 01:03:58.425
Gary, I don't need you
to-to-to...

984
01:03:58.469 --> 01:04:00.340
No, listen to me.
Listen to this.

985
01:04:01.428 --> 01:04:04.779
I always had all kind
of bad thoughts

986
01:04:04.823 --> 01:04:07.695
about what my life
was gonna be like,

987
01:04:07.739 --> 01:04:09.262
like... like what could happen.

988
01:04:09.306 --> 01:04:12.352
I mean, poverty, horrible illness.
You name it.

989
01:04:12.396 --> 01:04:16.704
But I never once imagined
that my marriage might fail.

990
01:04:16.748 --> 01:04:18.750
What is that, naive?

991
01:04:18.793 --> 01:04:20.186
Is it?

992
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:24.538
I mean, really,
why couldn't it happen to me?

993
01:04:24.582 --> 01:04:26.540
Because I have faith?

994
01:04:26.584 --> 01:04:28.716
Does that make me special?

995
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.980
Well, doesn't it? Yes.

996
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:34.853
That's exactly it.
It does.

997
01:04:34.897 --> 01:04:38.944
And it was faith
that rescued Ann and me.

998
01:04:38.988 --> 01:04:41.947
Sure, we needed help,
and it took time,

999
01:04:41.991 --> 01:04:44.994
but he was there for us
when we needed him.

1000
01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:49.215
So, you've just got
to get right.

1001
01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:51.391
Yeah, I know. I'm trying.

1002
01:04:54.699 --> 01:04:56.919
You still love Sarah?

1003
01:04:56.962 --> 01:04:59.747
You know I do.Okay. Okay.

1004
01:04:59.791 --> 01:05:02.925
Then find your hope
and fix this.

1005
01:05:02.968 --> 01:05:04.578
You can do it.

1006
01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:07.233
What if time were a factor?

1007
01:05:07.277 --> 01:05:10.106
What? What is it?
What are you talking about?

1008
01:05:10.149 --> 01:05:11.934
I'm sorry.
Forget I said that.

1009
01:05:11.977 --> 01:05:14.153
It's just...
Gary, this interview.

1010
01:05:14.197 --> 01:05:16.503
It's... I don't know.

1011
01:05:16.547 --> 01:05:19.158
It's... eating me up.

1012
01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:25.077
Is that where you've been
the past couple days? Yeah. It is.

1013
01:05:25.121 --> 01:05:27.645
It's really an interview?

1014
01:05:27.688 --> 01:05:29.603
Yeah. It is. Yeah.

1015
01:05:30.517 --> 01:05:32.563
With God?

1016
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:46.011
Okay.

1017
01:05:46.055 --> 01:05:48.840
You already pitched it to the
print edition, didn't you?

1018
01:05:48.883 --> 01:05:51.190
Yes.

1019
01:05:51.234 --> 01:05:54.498
- And they loved it.
- Come on, Gary. Look at me.

1020
01:05:54.541 --> 01:05:57.718
My wife just left me.
I'm crying my eyes out in your office.

1021
01:05:57.762 --> 01:06:00.547
It's possible I might need to
deal with some stuff right now.

1022
01:06:00.591 --> 01:06:02.985
Listen, you sort it out.

1023
01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:05.074
You take care of you first.

1024
01:06:05.117 --> 01:06:06.989
And remember what I said.
Get right.

1025
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.514
Thanks, Gary.Yeah.

1026
01:06:39.108 --> 01:06:41.197
Come on, pick up, pick up.

1027
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:48.204
I just nearly picked up.
I wanted to speak to him.

1028
01:06:48.247 --> 01:06:50.380
Then why didn't you?

1029
01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.295
Because I destroyed
my marriage.

1030
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.996
Sarah.

1031
01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.564
Sarah, I'm struggling here, okay?
I have to talk to you.

1032
01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:02.131
Could you call me back
right away?

1033
01:07:02.174 --> 01:07:04.133
It's important.

1034
01:07:04.176 --> 01:07:06.091
Please call me back.

1035
01:07:06.135 --> 01:07:07.527
Okay. Bye.

1036
01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.661
Wait. What the...?

1037
01:07:13.142 --> 01:07:16.232
How many men take back
a wife that cheated?

1038
01:07:17.755 --> 01:07:20.714
He was either working
or at the theological library.

1039
01:07:23.065 --> 01:07:27.112
He stopped going to church and his
men's group because he lost faith.

1040
01:07:27.156 --> 01:07:29.462
I made it about me.

1041
01:07:29.506 --> 01:07:30.855
He was gone.

1042
01:07:30.898 --> 01:07:33.858
- You don't know what I did.
- I know you're human.

1043
01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:49.700
You know me, right?

1044
01:07:49.743 --> 01:07:54.226
You know I don't believe
in all that pray-to-Jesus crap,

1045
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.838
but... maybe you should.

1046
01:07:58.796 --> 01:08:01.277
You're telling me to pray?

1047
01:08:01.929 --> 01:08:04.018
Can't hurt.

1048
01:08:04.062 --> 01:08:05.803
It can't reverse
what I did.

1049
01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.288
There's no going back from
what I've done, ever.

1050
01:08:58.247 --> 01:08:59.900
All right.

1051
01:09:23.185 --> 01:09:27.014
Why is he showing himself rather
than being hidden from me?

1052
01:09:30.801 --> 01:09:33.673
What am I to myself?
No one loved me.

1053
01:09:33.717 --> 01:09:36.198
Who am I?

1054
01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:39.810
Okay.

1055
01:09:40.506 --> 01:09:41.551
Okay.

1056
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:09.274
Can you hear me?

1057
01:10:15.454 --> 01:10:17.369
Why?
Because it's personal.

1058
01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.129
But you
have no secrets from me.

1059
01:10:19.153 --> 01:10:20.807
Yeah, I do. No, you don't.

1060
01:10:20.851 --> 01:10:24.289
Yeah, I do. My life is not the
topic of this conversation.

1061
01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.335
But it really is, Paul.

1062
01:10:26.378 --> 01:10:29.139
I don't know how many more ways I can say
this, but you need to start hearing me.

1063
01:10:29.163 --> 01:10:30.513
Okay.

1064
01:10:30.556 --> 01:10:32.556
We've done enough for today.
Thank you. All right.

1065
01:11:32.444 --> 01:11:34.359
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

1066
01:11:40.409 --> 01:11:43.107
I have
some more questions.

1067
01:11:45.196 --> 01:11:47.981
Today is our last interview,

1068
01:11:48.025 --> 01:11:50.375
and I want to come
to some conclusions.

1069
01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:52.508
Good. So do I.

1070
01:11:54.988 --> 01:11:56.903
I got it. All right.

1071
01:11:56.947 --> 01:11:58.383
Thank you.

1072
01:12:01.778 --> 01:12:03.997
Okay, recording.
Friday, June 3.

1073
01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:05.695
Last interview.

1074
01:12:12.354 --> 01:12:15.400
Your Italian is very good. Loyola Rome,
junior year abroad.

1075
01:12:15.444 --> 01:12:18.011
Well, that's time
well spent.

1076
01:12:18.055 --> 01:12:20.927
You gave me some pretty
disturbing news yesterday.

1077
01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:23.190
Was it news?

1078
01:12:23.234 --> 01:12:26.213
You keep saying that you're here because
I prayed, that you're here to help.

1079
01:12:26.237 --> 01:12:28.413
That's right. And yet you told me
I'm gonna die.

1080
01:12:28.457 --> 01:12:30.981
How does that help me? You're a journalist.

1081
01:12:31.024 --> 01:12:33.723
Surely you appreciate
the value of a deadline.

1082
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.507
Hmm.

1083
01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:39.642
Sorry. I knew it would get you back here.
So it was just manipulation?

1084
01:12:39.685 --> 01:12:43.515
No, motivation is the word I'd use,
and here you are.

1085
01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.082
You were pushing me? Yes, of course.

1086
01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:46.953
Like you've been pushing me
from the start?

1087
01:12:46.997 --> 01:12:50.174
- Well, maybe you needed a push.
- Is that your job?

1088
01:12:50.217 --> 01:12:55.222
Paul, I told you, I play an active
role in the lives of all my children.

1089
01:12:55.266 --> 01:12:58.791
So let's stop wasting time on things
you already know, and let's move on.

1090
01:12:58.835 --> 01:13:00.880
Shall we?

1091
01:13:00.924 --> 01:13:03.492
And you can cross that first
question off your list.

1092
01:13:08.453 --> 01:13:10.890
Is God just a clockmaker?

1093
01:13:10.934 --> 01:13:12.588
Now you know.

1094
01:13:14.677 --> 01:13:16.940
So, this is how it works
when God answers your prayers?

1095
01:13:16.983 --> 01:13:19.508
I never said I was here
to answer your prayers.Right.

1096
01:13:19.551 --> 01:13:22.380
You said you came because I prayed,
so maybe you can see my confusion.

1097
01:13:22.424 --> 01:13:26.297
But apparently it was just
to deliver some bad news, right?

1098
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:28.473
- 'Cause, you know, I feel fine.
- Oh?

1099
01:13:28.517 --> 01:13:30.606
Oh, are you here
to bargain with me?

1100
01:13:31.563 --> 01:13:34.174
No.Well, good.

1101
01:13:34.218 --> 01:13:36.786
Good.
Then let's move on.

1102
01:13:37.526 --> 01:13:39.397
Sure.

1103
01:13:39.441 --> 01:13:42.879
Let's talk about salvation. That's
not on your list for today, is it?

1104
01:13:42.922 --> 01:13:45.447
No.Anyway,
we discussed it yesterday.

1105
01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:48.754
I have more questions. Oh, I
think we covered it pretty well.

1106
01:13:48.798 --> 01:13:50.582
It's a big topic. Oh, I know.

1107
01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.758
A big topic for my readers. Mine too.

1108
01:13:52.802 --> 01:13:55.065
Okay.
So, what's the problem?

1109
01:13:55.108 --> 01:13:57.502
Apparently, we didn't
delve deeply enough.

1110
01:13:57.546 --> 01:14:00.287
Well, you know, now it feels just
a little more personal to me.

1111
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:01.985
I thought it might.

1112
01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:07.207
Really? That's all
you got for me?

1113
01:14:07.251 --> 01:14:09.906
What more do you want? Oh, I don't know.
Some answers.

1114
01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:13.518
What was the question
again?

1115
01:14:13.562 --> 01:14:17.043
Oh, that's just perfect.
See, this is what drives good people nuts.

1116
01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:18.958
We try to be good people,
try to please you,

1117
01:14:19.002 --> 01:14:21.134
and we need some answers,
and where did you go?

1118
01:14:21.178 --> 01:14:24.398
Do you have any idea how that feels...
like you're being judged every single day?

1119
01:14:24.442 --> 01:14:26.357
All we want
is some peace of mind,

1120
01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.553
but it's like you're...
I don't know... some cosmic killjoy.

1121
01:14:28.577 --> 01:14:31.536
Good, good.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

1122
01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.843
Doesn't really
seem like it.

1123
01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.714
Paul, you think salvation
is a burden?

1124
01:14:37.063 --> 01:14:40.110
Yes. But it's not.
It's a gift.

1125
01:14:40.153 --> 01:14:44.984
You and I remember my Sunday school
education a little differently.

1126
01:14:45.028 --> 01:14:47.770
All right. Let me try
to clear it up for you. Please do.

1127
01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:50.033
You're one
of my children. So you said.

1128
01:14:50.076 --> 01:14:52.470
Now, when you're a child,
your parents have rules, right?

1129
01:14:52.514 --> 01:14:54.037
Of course.

1130
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.865
Now, as you grow up,
what happens?

1131
01:14:55.908 --> 01:15:00.565
You mean, with my parents? Yes. What
changes for you, with your parents?

1132
01:15:00.609 --> 01:15:03.655
Uh, I don't know. Less rules, more
responsibilities. Is that what you mean?

1133
01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.788
Yes, and more freedoms too,
right? Sure.

1134
01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:08.442
So...
I mean, do you see?

1135
01:15:08.486 --> 01:15:11.576
No! What do you...
I'm sorry. Are we...

1136
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.578
We're still talking
about salvation or...?

1137
01:15:13.622 --> 01:15:16.059
All right. Let me put it
in a biblical context.

1138
01:15:16.102 --> 01:15:18.104
In the early days,
men were wicked.

1139
01:15:18.148 --> 01:15:20.063
Yes, and that didn't
work out too well for them.

1140
01:15:20.106 --> 01:15:22.718
No, salvation wasn't possible
then like it is now.

1141
01:15:22.761 --> 01:15:25.459
But I gave you another chance.
A new set of rules.

1142
01:15:25.503 --> 01:15:26.852
Moses. That's right.

1143
01:15:26.896 --> 01:15:28.854
Now, the law was clear,

1144
01:15:28.898 --> 01:15:32.031
but still the path to me
was indirect and difficult.

1145
01:15:32.075 --> 01:15:35.034
But all that changed one day
long ago in Bethlehem.

1146
01:15:35.078 --> 01:15:38.255
And it was good news. But it was
also the start of a new covenant.

1147
01:15:38.298 --> 01:15:40.779
A new way.Yes.

1148
01:15:40.823 --> 01:15:43.782
For example, Moses
had ten commandments,

1149
01:15:43.826 --> 01:15:46.002
but later Jesus only mentioned
six on two occasions.

1150
01:15:46.045 --> 01:15:48.221
I know the controversy.Yes.

1151
01:15:48.265 --> 01:15:52.399
Now, when asked how a man can enter heaven,
Jesus said, "You shall not murder.

1152
01:15:52.443 --> 01:15:55.838
You shall not steal.
You shall not commit adultery.

1153
01:15:55.881 --> 01:15:58.057
You shall not bear
false witness.

1154
01:15:58.101 --> 01:16:00.886
Honor thy father and mother.
Love your neighbor as yourself."

1155
01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:03.106
In Matthew and Mark.
Yes, I know.

1156
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:05.978
He left four off the list. The first four.
Yes, I know.

1157
01:16:06.022 --> 01:16:08.894
Yes, the four that deal with
man's relationship to God.

1158
01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:11.941
Now, what does that
tell you?

1159
01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:15.205
I'll assume it's not a typo. Now come on.
Think about it.

1160
01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:19.122
What's more likely... Jesus just
forgot four of the Ten Commandments,

1161
01:16:19.165 --> 01:16:22.255
or Jesus knew the world was changing,
that he was changing it,

1162
01:16:22.299 --> 01:16:24.693
and he didn't feel he needed
to remind his followers

1163
01:16:24.736 --> 01:16:29.001
that the Sabbath Day is holy,
or that there is only one true God?

1164
01:16:29.045 --> 01:16:31.787
And was he right? About what?

1165
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:33.745
God. Well, look around.

1166
01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:36.139
Know many polytheists
these days?

1167
01:16:40.317 --> 01:16:43.799
And you can cross that question
off your list as well.

1168
01:16:45.409 --> 01:16:47.237
Are you
the one true God?

1169
01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.980
Are we clear?

1170
01:16:52.546 --> 01:16:55.767
This is all very interesting,
but I still don't see the me in it.

1171
01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:59.118
Okay. How's this
for a headline?

1172
01:16:59.162 --> 01:17:03.122
Your life is not an audition
for the afterlife,

1173
01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:05.690
and if you can stop
worrying about that,

1174
01:17:05.734 --> 01:17:07.910
you just might have time
for other things.

1175
01:17:07.953 --> 01:17:10.739
Things like loving one
another and living your life.

1176
01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:12.915
However long that is.
Yeah.

1177
01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:15.308
Paul, I've given you
a great gift.

1178
01:17:15.352 --> 01:17:18.485
A new justification,
a new responsibility.

1179
01:17:18.529 --> 01:17:22.707
But it's up to you to receive
my gift before it's too late.

1180
01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:24.535
See, right there.

1181
01:17:24.578 --> 01:17:27.253
You say you're here to help me,
but that kind of sounds like a threat.

1182
01:17:27.277 --> 01:17:29.714
Why can't I do two things
at the same time, hmm?

1183
01:17:31.194 --> 01:17:33.109
For thousands of years,
Paul,

1184
01:17:33.152 --> 01:17:36.155
I have been trying to help
you find your way to me.

1185
01:17:36.199 --> 01:17:39.550
Now, did I always succeed?
Well, ask Noah.

1186
01:17:39.593 --> 01:17:41.987
Was I too vengeful
back then? Maybe.

1187
01:17:42.031 --> 01:17:45.164
But there's never a real threat
without a real consequence.

1188
01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:47.036
So, you are here
to threaten me.

1189
01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:48.733
Is that what
you really think?

1190
01:17:48.777 --> 01:17:51.867
Either way, I'm hoping for a
better outcome than in Noah's day.

1191
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:55.305
Oh, me too. Back then,
it took a flood.

1192
01:17:55.348 --> 01:17:59.396
Now it's just you and me in this
room with that digital recorder.

1193
01:17:59.439 --> 01:18:03.356
Not what comes to mind when you
think divine intervention, is it?

1194
01:18:08.318 --> 01:18:10.233
No, not really.

1195
01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.022
You know,
my editor was worried that I'm in danger.

1196
01:18:17.066 --> 01:18:19.068
I have the same concern.

1197
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:21.984
I think he...
I think he means danger from you.

1198
01:18:23.289 --> 01:18:24.856
Am I in danger?

1199
01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:28.425
What have we been talking about
for the past three days, Paul?

1200
01:18:28.468 --> 01:18:29.426
You.Stop.

1201
01:18:29.469 --> 01:18:30.688
You.Please.

1202
01:18:30.732 --> 01:18:33.082
You're the one... Stop. Please, stop.

1203
01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:36.563
Pardon me? Please stop!

1204
01:18:36.607 --> 01:18:40.132
- You're upset.
- Yes! It's been three days. Of course I'm upset.

1205
01:18:40.176 --> 01:18:42.047
What did you think
my reaction would be?

1206
01:18:42.091 --> 01:18:45.007
- But you knew that, didn't you? Didn't you?
- Yes.

1207
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:48.924
- So you admit it.
- I'm amazed you lasted this long.

1208
01:18:49.794 --> 01:18:52.231
Paul.

1209
01:18:52.275 --> 01:18:55.234
You thought you had an
interview with the Almighty.

1210
01:18:55.278 --> 01:18:57.933
No one in their right mind
would believe that.

1211
01:18:57.976 --> 01:19:01.327
But here you are,
day three, back for more?

1212
01:19:01.371 --> 01:19:04.983
And please, don't hand me, "I thought
it would be a good story," please.

1213
01:19:05.027 --> 01:19:07.116
Yeah, well, I did.Paul.

1214
01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.119
You are clearly in the midst
of a personal crisis.

1215
01:19:10.162 --> 01:19:13.296
So, I come along,
I offer you an interview with God,

1216
01:19:13.339 --> 01:19:15.864
and that's all it takes
for you to bite?

1217
01:19:15.907 --> 01:19:19.128
Really? Paul, what does that
tell you about yourself?

1218
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.260
That's not fair. Fair?

1219
01:19:21.304 --> 01:19:23.872
I've been doing you a favor
these past few days, Paul.

1220
01:19:23.915 --> 01:19:26.918
I've given you something to think
about other than your own life.

1221
01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.181
So what, this is
some big, elaborate con?

1222
01:19:29.225 --> 01:19:31.836
Oh, would that
really surprise you?

1223
01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:33.882
I can't believe this.
You told me you were God.

1224
01:19:33.925 --> 01:19:35.840
That's right.

1225
01:19:35.884 --> 01:19:39.104
And if you didn't want it to be true,
you and I would not be here right now.

1226
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.240
You forgot
to turn off your phone.Yeah.

1227
01:19:44.283 --> 01:19:46.851
And now you're leaving.Yes.

1228
01:20:21.755 --> 01:20:23.279
Oh, excuse me.Hey.

1229
01:20:23.322 --> 01:20:25.107
Hi.Hi. Yes.
What do you need?

1230
01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:28.458
- Uh, I was in this room, 22.
- Uh, sorry. In that room?

1231
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:30.895
Yeah, do you know
whose office this is?

1232
01:20:30.939 --> 01:20:33.332
I thought
that was storage. No?

1233
01:20:34.507 --> 01:20:36.031
Uh...

1234
01:20:39.948 --> 01:20:41.863
What do you know?

1235
01:20:41.906 --> 01:20:43.865
Uh, who are you
looking for?

1236
01:20:43.908 --> 01:20:45.388
Maybe they have the keys.

1237
01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:48.478
Uh, never mind.
Thank you.

1238
01:21:10.674 --> 01:21:13.677
Who are you? Have a seat, Paul.
Let's talk about it.

1239
01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.027
- No. Tell me who you are.
- I really think you should...

1240
01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:18.856
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.

1241
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:22.033
- The prince of lies?
- Think back over the past three days, Paul.

1242
01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:24.993
- Have I told you one lie?
- Yes.

1243
01:21:25.036 --> 01:21:27.256
No. I don't know. Well, which is it?

1244
01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:29.562
I don't know!
Everything you said could have been a lie.

1245
01:21:29.606 --> 01:21:31.869
But every word was true,
and you know it.

1246
01:21:31.913 --> 01:21:33.784
You told me you were God.Yes.

1247
01:21:33.827 --> 01:21:35.394
- TheGod.
- That's right.

1248
01:21:35.438 --> 01:21:38.223
Bad news. According to
my friend, you're dead.

1249
01:21:38.267 --> 01:21:41.052
I understand, but sometimes
that's just how it looks.

1250
01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:43.750
I promise you, God lives.

1251
01:21:43.794 --> 01:21:46.884
I can't believe I agreed to this.
Why did you even contact me?

1252
01:21:46.928 --> 01:21:48.973
You contacted me.

1253
01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:51.106
What are you talking about? You did.

1254
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:54.239
What? You contacted me. Three days,
three interviews, three locations.

1255
01:21:54.283 --> 01:21:57.199
- And how did I do that?
- What? You contacted me!

1256
01:21:57.242 --> 01:21:59.462
And how did I
contact you?

1257
01:21:59.505 --> 01:22:02.552
Did I call you or send you a letter?
Was it an e-mail? Snapchat?

1258
01:22:02.595 --> 01:22:04.119
How?

1259
01:22:05.685 --> 01:22:08.123
You-You... You s...

1260
01:22:09.907 --> 01:22:11.213
I don't know.

1261
01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:13.955
Paul, think about it.

1262
01:22:16.174 --> 01:22:18.872
No, this can't be happening.

1263
01:22:18.916 --> 01:22:20.613
But it is.

1264
01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:23.355
So please, why don't you sit down,
and we can talk about it.

1265
01:22:23.399 --> 01:22:25.575
- I'm just here to help you.
- Help?

1266
01:22:25.618 --> 01:22:28.099
Yes. That's a laugh.
How have you helped?

1267
01:22:28.143 --> 01:22:31.842
By stopping you from making a very
bad decision, by keeping you safe.

1268
01:22:31.885 --> 01:22:33.104
Safe? Yes.

1269
01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.367
You told me I was gonna die.Yes.

1270
01:22:35.411 --> 01:22:37.979
- You were gonna tell me when.
- Yes, but you already knew.

1271
01:22:38.022 --> 01:22:40.862
What are you talking about? How could
I know? How could I possibly know?

1272
01:22:40.894 --> 01:22:43.332
You knew exactly when.
How could I know?

1273
01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:47.336
Because it was going to happen
by your own hand, Paul.

1274
01:22:49.512 --> 01:22:51.601
No.

1275
01:22:53.211 --> 01:22:56.867
No, you don't know that.

1276
01:22:56.910 --> 01:23:00.740
There aren't always signs
when someone is in trouble.

1277
01:23:00.784 --> 01:23:02.525
But you can't hide
from me.

1278
01:23:04.048 --> 01:23:06.007
Why are you doing this to me?

1279
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:08.444
You've just
lost your way.

1280
01:23:08.487 --> 01:23:11.577
No, you let this happen to me. How so?

1281
01:23:11.621 --> 01:23:13.362
I prayed. I prayed.

1282
01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:15.059
I know. I begged you for help.

1283
01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:18.367
And you think bad things happen
to you because I don't care?

1284
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:21.370
You didn't listen. Bad things happen
all the time.

1285
01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:25.591
Every day.
Every minute of every day.

1286
01:23:25.635 --> 01:23:28.203
You know that.
You said it yourself.

1287
01:23:28.246 --> 01:23:30.379
And it's very sad.

1288
01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:33.034
But the truth is,
most people only seem to notice bad things

1289
01:23:33.077 --> 01:23:36.037
when they happen to them.

1290
01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:38.561
And maybe that's
the saddest part of all.

1291
01:23:39.692 --> 01:23:42.086
You really need to sit.

1292
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.175
Why don't you help us?

1293
01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:47.309
I hear you.
I hear it all.

1294
01:23:47.352 --> 01:23:50.225
Why is there war,
starvation, poverty,

1295
01:23:50.268 --> 01:23:52.705
disease, fire, flood,

1296
01:23:52.749 --> 01:23:56.013
a child goes missing,
a man loses hope?

1297
01:23:56.057 --> 01:23:57.710
Do something! Yes, do something.

1298
01:23:57.754 --> 01:24:00.844
You have more power
than you know, Paul.

1299
01:24:00.887 --> 01:24:05.544
Food can be grown.
Diseases can be cured. Wars ended.

1300
01:24:05.588 --> 01:24:07.894
A troubled veteran
can be helped

1301
01:24:07.938 --> 01:24:10.767
and a marriage saved.

1302
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:14.901
So, when you ask me why
all this is happening,

1303
01:24:14.945 --> 01:24:16.860
start by looking
to each other.

1304
01:24:16.903 --> 01:24:20.211
And that's where I'll be.
No, I need a miracle.

1305
01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:22.866
Well, miracles happen
every day. And sometimes...

1306
01:24:22.909 --> 01:24:24.346
Please.

1307
01:24:24.389 --> 01:24:26.826
Sometimes
the miracle is you.

1308
01:24:27.827 --> 01:24:29.438
Wh-What's happening?

1309
01:24:30.308 --> 01:24:31.657
You never know.

1310
01:24:31.701 --> 01:24:33.920
No.

1311
01:24:36.445 --> 01:24:37.533
No.

1312
01:24:37.576 --> 01:24:40.449
My salvation. Give it time.

1313
01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:42.581
I told you,

1314
01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:47.804
sometimes bad things do happen
to some very good people.

1315
01:25:56.612 --> 01:25:59.658
Guess I'm walking.

1316
01:26:31.516 --> 01:26:34.258
Hey, Matt.
What happened today?

1317
01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:38.044
Great.

1318
01:26:38.088 --> 01:26:40.656
Wow, great!

1319
01:26:40.699 --> 01:26:43.441
No, no. It's fine.
Just a phone number.

1320
01:26:44.921 --> 01:26:48.533
Okay.

1321
01:26:48.577 --> 01:26:51.057
Okay.

1322
01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:52.755
It was a miracle.
It was a miracle.

1323
01:26:52.798 --> 01:26:54.974
Who am I to say
it wasn't, right?

1324
01:26:56.324 --> 01:26:58.413
No, you were due.

1325
01:26:59.544 --> 01:27:01.546
Sarah?

1326
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:04.288
Yeah, okay, I'll tell her.

1327
01:27:04.332 --> 01:27:06.464
Yeah, I will tell her.
Yeah. Yeah.

1328
01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:10.425
I'm glad.
I'm very happy for you.

1329
01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:13.950
Of course.

1330
01:27:13.993 --> 01:27:15.778
All right, brother.
Bye.

1331
01:27:15.821 --> 01:27:17.432
See you soon. Bye.

1332
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:44.894
Hi.

1333
01:27:46.156 --> 01:27:48.289
Hi.

1334
01:27:52.118 --> 01:27:54.295
It's good to see you.

1335
01:27:56.122 --> 01:27:58.299
Where's your bike?

1336
01:27:58.342 --> 01:28:00.997
No idea.

1337
01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.521
What happened?

1338
01:28:03.565 --> 01:28:05.654
It's just, uh, gone.

1339
01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:11.573
- You love that bike.
- It's just a bike.

1340
01:28:12.748 --> 01:28:15.316
What happened
to your hand?

1341
01:28:15.359 --> 01:28:19.145
Oh, uh... I broke one
of the jadeite cups.

1342
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:21.583
Are you okay? Yeah, it'll heal.

1343
01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:27.893
Sorry about the cup.

1344
01:28:27.937 --> 01:28:29.852
It was just a cup.

1345
01:28:36.206 --> 01:28:37.686
Are you okay?

1346
01:28:43.866 --> 01:28:45.389
Yeah.

1347
01:28:48.131 --> 01:28:49.611
Listen, I...

1348
01:28:52.483 --> 01:28:54.529
I just came to apologize.

1349
01:28:56.226 --> 01:28:57.706
I'm sorry.

1350
01:29:06.105 --> 01:29:08.020
I'm so ashamed.

1351
01:29:35.831 --> 01:29:37.441
I loved you.

1352
01:29:40.096 --> 01:29:43.142
I still... love you.

1353
01:29:50.933 --> 01:29:52.674
I forgive you.

1354
01:30:12.171 --> 01:30:14.043
I should get going.

1355
01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.962
Bye.Stop.

1356
01:30:26.577 --> 01:30:28.797
May I ask you something?

1357
01:30:33.105 --> 01:30:35.281
Do you think that you
coming back here today

1358
01:30:35.325 --> 01:30:37.588
is a...

1359
01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.808
was some sort of sign?

1360
01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:51.384
Sarah! You're back.
Told ya.

1361
01:30:51.428 --> 01:30:54.518
Echinacea.
Stuff's great.

1362
01:30:54.562 --> 01:30:57.434
Echinacea? Yep.
It's the miracle cure.

1363
01:30:57.478 --> 01:31:01.569
Miracles. Hey,
they happen every day.

1364
01:31:09.446 --> 01:31:11.230
Can we talk?

1365
01:31:12.449 --> 01:31:13.972
Inside?

1366
01:31:15.539 --> 01:31:18.847
Uh... yeah.

1367
01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:21.545
I'd like that.

1368
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.900
Sarah.

1369
01:31:33.426 --> 01:31:35.298
I love you too.

1370
01:32:08.287 --> 01:32:11.856
Having faith isn't
worth much if you don't really believe.

1371
01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.902
I kept praying, sure,

1372
01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:17.558
but I stopped looking or even listening.

1373
01:32:33.704 --> 01:32:37.926
What could you possibly do that
would be beyond my powers to forgive?

1374
01:32:44.585 --> 01:32:47.370
So, yeah, I see it now.

1375
01:32:50.155 --> 01:32:52.027
Definitely a sign.
