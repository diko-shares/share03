1
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.545
Oh, man.

2
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.135
That's it.

3
00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:01.181
Nice grab.

4
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.520
Oh, yeah.

5
00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:12.275
- All right, Danny, your turn.
- What? I didn't get my full turn.

6
00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.778
You did. I counted.
That was 25. That's what we said.

7
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.489
- That's not fair.
- It's exactly fair. Come on, Danny.

8
00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:19.574
Time for your turn,
then I gotta work for an hour.

9
00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:23.370
You know, you're not the only one
who gets a turn.

10
00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:25.455
- "The only one who gets a turn."
- Guys.

11
00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:28.208
All right.

12
00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:33.088
Keep your eye on the ball.
You got it this time. Ready?

13
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:38.260
All right, that's a good try.
It was a bad throw.

14
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:41.305
It's a bad throw. Sorry. My bad.

15
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.935
Okay. Here we go.
You can do this. Here we go.

16
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.104
Ready?

17
00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.026
Okay. A deep fly ball to right field.

18
00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.195
Clemente back,
running on his horse real fast.

19
00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:58.989
Can he get it?

20
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:02.909
And Milton Bradley
with his dive-and-roll catch.

21
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.329
- Dodgers win.
- You're such a dick.

22
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.252
What? It was a great grab.

23
00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.297
Danny?

24
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:19.593
Danny.

25
00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:34.399
Danny, you really should not
be using that kind of language

26
00:04:34.483 --> 00:04:35.609
with your brother.

27
00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.152
But it's true.

28
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:41.531
Listen, kiddo,
when I was six years old...

29
00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.699
Six and three quarters.

30
00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:45.702
When I was six and three quarters,
catching was hard for me too.

31
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:48.622
Well, it's not hard for Walter.

32
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:50.040
Well, Walter's ten.

33
00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.959
So? He's still better than me
at everything.

34
00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.629
No way.
He's not better than you at piano.

35
00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.215
I hate that stupid thing.

36
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:02.719
Someday you're gonna be really happy
I got you that piano.

37
00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.305
You'll be at a party,
there'll be this pretty girl...

38
00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.556
Like you and mom?

39
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:16.900
Look, Danny.
You and Walter are different people.

40
00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.152
He's good at some things,
you're good at other things.

41
00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:23.407
- That's how people are.
- He beats me at everything.

42
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.578
Listen to me, this is important.
You're a very special kid.

43
00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:33.208
That's what people say
when they can't think of anything.

44
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.003
You know how you always make up
games

45
00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:37.754
and pretend to be characters?

46
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.632
You have an incredible imagination.

47
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:46.430
Amazing imagination.
A whole universe of an imagination.

48
00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:49.433
And I use my imagination for a living

49
00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.018
so I know what I'm talking about.

50
00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.187
Is it better than Walter's?

51
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.481
What?

52
00:05:56.565 --> 00:05:59.359
Is my imagination
better than Walter's?

53
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.616
You're different than Walter.

54
00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.126
- Don't do that.
- You wanna play catch?

55
00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.211
- We just played catch.
- No, football catch.

56
00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.880
I have to work for an hour.

57
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.549
- But it's Saturday.
- Tell me about it.

58
00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:28.388
- All you ever do is work.
- Nice try.

59
00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.515
- This is so unfair.
- Hello.

60
00:06:31.058 --> 00:06:33.977
Bill, I am so sorry.
I'll call you back in two minutes.

61
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:35.103
Is that okay?

62
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:36.938
Thanks.

63
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.359
I have a really important meeting
this afternoon, Walter.

64
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:42.361
I really have to be ready for it.

65
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:44.154
- You're going out?
- Yes, I'm going out.

66
00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.781
Well, I'm going to a meeting.

67
00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.491
You're gonna be
at mom's house anyway.

68
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.535
- She's coming to get you at three.
- We go to mom's tomorrow.

69
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:51.662
No, today.

70
00:06:51.745 --> 00:06:53.914
- This is a four-day dad week.
- No. Three-day dad week.

71
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.040
Four-day last week

72
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.625
four-day next week,
three-day this week.

73
00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.210
Four-day mom week this week.

74
00:06:58.627 --> 00:06:59.836
But that's not fair.

75
00:07:00.712 --> 00:07:02.297
- To whom?
- To anyone.

76
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.757
I have to work.

77
00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:06.718
We'd have all the time we wanted
if Danny wasn't around.

78
00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:07.928
Well, Danny is around.

79
00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:13.100
- All right, five throws.
- How do I put this?

80
00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:15.727
Let me think. I have to work.

81
00:07:16.228 --> 00:07:18.146
Dad, I'm ready to play
<i>Smash Brothers.</i>

82
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:20.148
What? You told him you'd play
<i>Smash Brothers</i>?

83
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:22.484
No. I didn't tell him
I was gonna play <i>Smash Brothers.</i>

84
00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.071
- You're playing catch with Walter?
- He might if you weren't around.

85
00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.364
- You're so mean.
- Guys.

86
00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.865
Everybody wants to ruin my life.

87
00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:30.575
- You never keep your promises.
- All you care about is work.

88
00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:32.285
There's only one of me, okay?

89
00:07:32.828 --> 00:07:35.831
I don't like this situation either,
it sucks, is what it does.

90
00:07:36.164 --> 00:07:38.125
But it's the best
I could come up with.

91
00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.543
So climb off my back

92
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.337
and give me about two inches
of space, will you, please?

93
00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:00.731
There are some days, boys

94
00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:03.525
when you gotta grow up all at once.

95
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.778
I need today to be one of those days.

96
00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:17.831
Wanna play <i>Chutes and Ladders</i>?

97
00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.960
- No, you'll cheat.
- <i>Stratego?</i>

98
00:08:23.587 --> 00:08:25.255
No, you cheat at board games.

99
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:27.591
But you can't even cheat at <i>Stratego.</i>

100
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.468
Trust me, you'll find a way.

101
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:31.553
Hey. Sorry about that.

102
00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:33.513
Oh, no, it's fine.

103
00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.224
I'm not meeting him till 3.30,
I can finish by then.

104
00:08:36.683 --> 00:08:40.020
- Walter, look what I found.
- Those belong to me. Put them back.

105
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.857
- But you never play with them.
- So? They're still mine.

106
00:08:44.483 --> 00:08:47.819
- When did you get so mean?
- I'm not mean, Danny.

107
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:50.364
I'm in fourth grade,
I have a girlfriend.

108
00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:52.324
You know how dad said
we have to grow up?

109
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.867
Well, this is what it looks like.

110
00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:56.953
Can we please play <i>Army Men</i>?

111
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.085
Copy that.

112
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:06.880
Sergeant, there is a helicopter
on fire. Let's get it.

113
00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.840
The drawings all match
the foam mock-up.

114
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.342
- Get back here.
- Let me hold it.

115
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.510
- Yes, red.
- You'll break it.

116
00:09:11.593 --> 00:09:12.636
Give me.

117
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.888
Cranberry, right.
It's whatever color they picked.

118
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:16.598
I worked from the chits.

119
00:09:16.682 --> 00:09:19.017
Can I call you back one more time,
real quick?

120
00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:20.811
It's a small domestic emergency here.

121
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:23.230
- Dad!
- I know.

122
00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:25.565
- Dad.
- It's not a problem. Okay, thanks.

123
00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:27.901
- Look what he did.
- I was on the phone.

124
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:30.487
- It was an accident.
- You're such a baby.

125
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.781
- I'm not a baby.
- You break all my stuff.

126
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:33.907
- You can't catch a ball...
- That's enough!

127
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:35.826
...and nobody wants you around!

128
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.035
- Enough!
- You shut up!

129
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.584
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:49.006
It's ten minutes to the office.

131
00:09:49.423 --> 00:09:51.383
I have to run off another copy.
I'll be right back.

132
00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:54.136
You're gonna leave us alone
in this creepy old house?

133
00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:56.430
- It's not creepy, it's old.
- I like mom's better.

134
00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.390
Well, so did she, and now it's hers.

135
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:07.065
Look, this is a very special house.

136
00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:08.984
The reason I'm working so hard
to fix it up

137
00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:11.028
is I wanna make a home for us here.

138
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:14.865
And I know it's not Mom's house,
and I know it's a little creaky

139
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:17.451
but give it some time,
it's gonna grow on you.

140
00:10:17.534 --> 00:10:19.411
I don't wanna stay here alone.

141
00:10:19.494 --> 00:10:22.372
Well, you're not gonna be alone.
I'm going to wake up Lisa.

142
00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:24.082
- No. Don't wake up Lisa.
- What, are you crazy?

143
00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:26.668
- Don't do that.
- She's sleeping. Let her sleep.

144
00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:29.087
Honey.

145
00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:34.634
Lisa. Honey.
Get up. I need to go out.

146
00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:37.304
I need you to look after your two
favorite people in the world.

147
00:10:38.847 --> 00:10:39.890
Come on.

148
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:46.104
- I can't. I have a date tonight.
- What time?

149
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.774
We're hooking up at, like, eight?

150
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:52.361
- It's two.
- So?

151
00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:55.614
- So that's six hours from now.
- What's your point?

152
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.240
My point is I need you
to look after the boys.

153
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.450
By the way, it makes me uncomfortable

154
00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:59.576
when you say "hooking up."

155
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.203
Why?

156
00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:03.330
It's not like it means anything.

157
00:11:03.413 --> 00:11:05.123
- Hope it doesn't.
- It doesn't.

158
00:11:05.207 --> 00:11:06.249
It's just an expression.

159
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.001
- Hope it is.
- It is.

160
00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:10.879
God.
We never should have rented <i>Thirteen</i>.

161
00:11:11.213 --> 00:11:12.381
Just keep your eye on them.

162
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:14.174
Make sure they don't
burn down the house. All right?

163
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:17.552
- Okay?
- I'm not deaf.

164
00:11:18.261 --> 00:11:19.304
I'm not deaf.

165
00:11:19.388 --> 00:11:21.056
- What?
- Dad, okay.

166
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.308
Fifteen minutes, just close the door.

167
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:25.977
Thank you.

168
00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:41.576
Yeah, I am.

169
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:43.662
Yeah, hold on.

170
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:09.730
Hey!

171
00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:13.442
- Dad said no video games.
- He did not.

172
00:12:14.484 --> 00:12:15.694
Fine.

173
00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:22.743
<i>It's a giraffe.</i>

174
00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:31.626
- <i>This is SportsCenter.</i>
- Hey.

175
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.253
I was watching that.

176
00:12:34.004 --> 00:12:37.341
<i>It is Oakland. It is Boston.
It is Manny Ramirez.</i>

177
00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:40.010
- Can't we watch <i>SpongeBob</i>?
- No.

178
00:12:40.093 --> 00:12:43.013
- You used to like it.
- Times change.

179
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.431
Tartar sauce.

180
00:12:45.307 --> 00:12:46.475
I'm hungry.

181
00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.643
So? What do you want me
to do about it?

182
00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.438
- Make me macaroni and cheese?
- I don't know how.

183
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:53.982
I'm hungry.
What do you know how to make?

184
00:12:54.066 --> 00:12:55.108
Water.

185
00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.364
<i>Two-run shot. Are you kidding me?
Next batter, Jason Varitek.</i>

186
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:04.910
<i>In the air to deep right field.
Down the line, towards the pole.</i>

187
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.788
How about if you and me play catch?

188
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:08.955
No.

189
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:15.879
<i>The first guy to give up
walk-off home runs</i>

190
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.882
<i>on consecutive days since 1998.</i>

191
00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:20.926
<i>Bo Sox win it six to five.</i>

192
00:13:29.351 --> 00:13:31.770
<i>History-making moment for...</i>

193
00:13:32.979 --> 00:13:34.022
You're dead!

194
00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:36.650
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:54.626
Danny?

196
00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.172
Where are you?

197
00:14:04.094 --> 00:14:05.178
Danny?

198
00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:09.391
Where are you, Danny?

199
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.858
Danny? Where are you?

200
00:14:20.986 --> 00:14:23.238
- There you are.
- I said I was sorry.

201
00:14:23.864 --> 00:14:25.365
Don't. No.

202
00:14:27.617 --> 00:14:29.286
Don't do that, it's not funny.

203
00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:30.912
You'll be safe in here
till dad gets back.

204
00:14:30.996 --> 00:14:34.249
You're just jealous because
dad thinks I'm smarter than you.

205
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:36.877
I didn't mean that.

206
00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.173
Walter. No.

207
00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:44.176
Pull me up. Don't.

208
00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.510
- What's the matter, Danny?
- Pull me up.

209
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:47.471
Not still scared of the basement,
are you?

210
00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.723
Walter!

211
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.768
No, Walter! It's not funny!

212
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.894
No!

213
00:14:54.936 --> 00:14:56.146
Pull me up!

214
00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:57.939
Walter!

215
00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.275
Three-year-olds are scared
of basements.

216
00:17:19.206 --> 00:17:23.210
- You're really mean.
- Dad said not to play in there.

217
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:28.548
Look what I found in the basement.

218
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.093
Looks dumb and old.

219
00:17:32.427 --> 00:17:35.931
- I like it.
- Yeah, you would, it's for babies.

220
00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:45.232
Walter, this is so cool.
Check this out.

221
00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.951
What's Zathura?

222
00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:12.134
- Will you play with me?
- No.

223
00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:14.678
- I won't cheat.
- Yeah, you will.

224
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.632
- A card came out.
- Fascinating.

225
00:18:56.261 --> 00:19:01.308
<i>Meter... or... shoe...</i>

226
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.479
<i>Meteor... Shoe.</i>

227
00:19:06.563 --> 00:19:07.731
Read this for me.

228
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.110
<i>Meteor shower. Take evasive action.</i>

229
00:19:12.444 --> 00:19:13.945
What's evasive action?

230
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:15.781
It's when you get out of the way
of something.

231
00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:18.992
What exactly am I supposed
to get out of the way of, exactly?

232
00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:21.661
I have no idea.
All it says is <i>Take evasive...</i>

233
00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:48.688
Grandma!

234
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:57.948
It's meteors!

235
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:03.328
Take evasive action!

236
00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:29.354
Danny, in here!

237
00:20:29.438 --> 00:20:30.814
Danny, hurry up, it's safe.

238
00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.357
Danny, come on, hurry!

239
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:33.900
Danny, come on. Hurry up!

240
00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:35.318
Hurry!

241
00:20:35.402 --> 00:20:37.028
Come on. Get in.

242
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.546
<i>This is SportsCenter.</i>

243
00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:58.133
<i>Schilling deals no love...</i>

244
00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.825
I don't think we should play
that game anymore.

245
00:21:42.844 --> 00:21:46.056
That's weird.
It only hit the living room.

246
00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:06.034
Wow, outer space.

247
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.328
No, that's just nighttime.

248
00:22:10.247 --> 00:22:13.959
I don't know, Walter.
Night never looked so close before.

249
00:22:21.299 --> 00:22:22.342
Wait.

250
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.474
Walter, check this out.

251
00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:00.982
- Tell her.
- You tell her.

252
00:24:01.066 --> 00:24:02.609
You should,
she won't freak out as much.

253
00:24:02.692 --> 00:24:04.194
We shouldn't really even be in here.

254
00:24:04.903 --> 00:24:07.072
Dude, we're in outer space.
It doesn't matter anymore.

255
00:24:07.155 --> 00:24:09.449
- Then you wake her.
- Fine.

256
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:12.536
Lisa.

257
00:24:13.537 --> 00:24:15.831
Lisa.

258
00:24:15.914 --> 00:24:18.208
- Go away.
- Lisa, you gotta get up.

259
00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:20.335
What's the rule
about being in my room?

260
00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:21.461
- We're not allowed in...
- We're not allowed in...

261
00:24:21.545 --> 00:24:22.587
- ...unless it's an emergency.
- ...unless it's an emergency.

262
00:24:23.213 --> 00:24:24.506
And what's the emergency?

263
00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:27.259
There was a meteor shower
and everything got wrecked.

264
00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:28.385
We don't know how
to get back to Earth.

265
00:24:28.468 --> 00:24:29.553
Shut up!

266
00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:31.138
- Just look.
- Yeah.

267
00:24:34.683 --> 00:24:35.851
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

268
00:24:35.934 --> 00:24:37.519
- What do we do?
- It's already dark?

269
00:24:37.602 --> 00:24:38.645
I'm gonna be so late.

270
00:24:38.729 --> 00:24:40.480
- It's not dark.
- We're in outer space.

271
00:24:40.564 --> 00:24:42.107
I saw Saturn outside.

272
00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:48.697
- Lisa, open up.
- Shut up and listen to me.

273
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.699
Dad put me in charge
until he got home.

274
00:24:50.782 --> 00:24:52.868
Which means you guys
need to do what I say.

275
00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:55.704
Do me a favor. Go downstairs
and stay out of my face.

276
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:57.205
But it's an emergency.

277
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:59.040
- Is the house on fire?
- No.

278
00:24:59.124 --> 00:25:00.709
- Is anyone hurt?
- No, but...

279
00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:03.420
- Then leave.
- Lisa, please. We're really scared.

280
00:25:03.503 --> 00:25:05.589
Can you just watch
what this game does?

281
00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:11.678
If this is some weird joke you guys
are trying to pull, you're dead.

282
00:25:11.762 --> 00:25:13.472
- No, this is not a joke.
- No, it's not a joke.

283
00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:15.724
Here, watch this. Watch this. Here.

284
00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:19.644
- Okay. So wind the key.
- All right.

285
00:25:19.728 --> 00:25:21.813
- So now I'm winding the key.
- Yeah, see?

286
00:25:21.897 --> 00:25:23.940
- And then push the button.
- So I push it?

287
00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:25.067
- Yeah.
- Pushing the button.

288
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.152
Then the number winds,
and whatever the number is

289
00:25:27.235 --> 00:25:28.278
- like nine.
- Nine!

290
00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:30.197
Then, your ship, the blue ship

291
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.574
because the red ship is mine,
I got a five.

292
00:25:32.908 --> 00:25:36.203
So then it goes to nine,
which would be that thing.

293
00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:38.288
- All right.
- Then the card's gonna pop out.

294
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:39.414
- The card.
- The card.

295
00:25:39.498 --> 00:25:40.665
- The card!
- The card!

296
00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:43.710
- The card.
- Here's the scary part.

297
00:25:44.544 --> 00:25:46.129
<i>You're promoted
to a starship captain.</i>

298
00:25:46.213 --> 00:25:47.881
<i>Move ahead two spaces.</i>

299
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:51.635
Fascinating.

300
00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:54.137
- Lisa, no, no! Lisa!
- No, wait, Lisa!

301
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:56.348
Wait, that one didn't count.
Let me go. Here.

302
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.438
- It's stuck.
- Maybe we have to take turns.

303
00:26:05.065 --> 00:26:06.149
See? It was my turn.

304
00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:09.236
- Four.
- Yeah, four.

305
00:26:13.448 --> 00:26:14.491
Card.

306
00:26:16.868 --> 00:26:20.455
<i>Shipmate enters cryonic
sleep chamber for five turns.</i>

307
00:26:20.997 --> 00:26:22.624
What the heck does that mean?

308
00:26:36.763 --> 00:26:37.848
Lisa?

309
00:26:38.515 --> 00:26:40.726
Does cryonic mean ice?

310
00:26:41.143 --> 00:26:42.227
Lisa.

311
00:26:45.814 --> 00:26:46.857
Help.

312
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:16.636
I killed her.

313
00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:20.432
You didn't kill her.
She's frozen in cryonic sleep.

314
00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:24.478
I gotta melt her.

315
00:27:41.745 --> 00:27:42.954
Are you crazy?

316
00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:45.499
We can't just leave her here
like this.

317
00:27:45.916 --> 00:27:48.335
Maybe we should read
the instructions.

318
00:27:53.423 --> 00:27:55.884
<i>Zathura.
Attention, space adventurers.</i>

319
00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:57.385
<i>Zathura awaits.</i>

320
00:27:57.761 --> 00:28:00.138
<i>Do you have what it takes
to navigate the galaxy?</i>

321
00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.182
<i>It's not for the faint of heart.</i>

322
00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:04.017
<i>For once you embark upon your journey</i>

323
00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:06.770
<i>there's no turning back
until Zathura's reached.</i>

324
00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:08.605
<i>Pieces reset at the end of each game.</i>

325
00:28:09.064 --> 00:28:10.982
<i>Play again and again
for different adventures.</i>

326
00:28:11.775 --> 00:28:13.402
That's it. We gotta keep playing.

327
00:28:14.444 --> 00:28:17.239
- I'm not playing that thing.
- Yes, we are.

328
00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:20.826
- It says we go home if we win.
- It didn't say that.

329
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:21.952
Yes, it did.

330
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:24.204
<i>Pieces reset at the end of each game.</i>

331
00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:25.997
That means we go home
when we're finished.

332
00:28:26.081 --> 00:28:29.835
All I know is that when we play
this game, bad things happen.

333
00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:32.462
All I know is that when I played
that game, I got promoted.

334
00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:34.339
So I'm gonna win this thing
and get us home.

335
00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:36.216
- Wait, can we...
- Don't be a baby.

336
00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:37.509
I'm not a baby.

337
00:28:45.142 --> 00:28:46.810
Look, eight, I'm halfway there.

338
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.493
<i>Your robot is defective.</i>

339
00:29:03.785 --> 00:29:04.953
What does that mean?

340
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.582
- Means my robot's broken.
- But you don't even have a robot.

341
00:29:36.985 --> 00:29:40.322
Emergency.

342
00:29:47.537 --> 00:29:49.206
That's your robot?

343
00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:51.833
- At least I got one.
- Well, what does it do?

344
00:29:51.917 --> 00:29:55.504
Anything I want.
Get me a juice box, biatch.

345
00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:57.923
- Don't do that.
- Why not? It's my robot.

346
00:29:58.006 --> 00:29:59.883
- You might make it mad.
- It's three inches tall.

347
00:29:59.966 --> 00:30:02.511
I'll punt it across the room.
It's my robot, the card says.

348
00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:05.889
I never said it wasn't your robot.
You don't have to be such a jerk.

349
00:30:05.972 --> 00:30:08.475
Dude, you're just jealous
'cause I have a robot and you don't.

350
00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:10.602
- Why would I want...
- Emergency.

351
00:30:12.646 --> 00:30:14.189
Emergency.

352
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:29.204
Alien life form. Must destroy.

353
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:32.541
Walter,
I think he's talking about you.

354
00:31:29.765 --> 00:31:32.976
Alien life form. Must destroy.

355
00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:37.397
Danny, take your turn.

356
00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:49.367
- There's no key.
- Find it!

357
00:32:14.518 --> 00:32:16.019
Take it. Come on, hurry.

358
00:32:40.961 --> 00:32:42.170
Take your turn!

359
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.316
Why didn't you go?
I could have been killed.

360
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.528
I was scared.
But it's okay, he's gone, isn't he?

361
00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:54.993
Danny, take your turn.

362
00:34:06.671 --> 00:34:09.591
- Danny, give me the card.
- It's still moving.

363
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:14.137
Hurry up, Danny.

364
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:17.474
The card.

365
00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:40.038
What did the card say?

366
00:35:08.608 --> 00:35:12.362
<i>You pass too close to Tsouris-3.
Enter gravity field.</i>

367
00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.836
Danny!

368
00:35:53.153 --> 00:35:54.571
Danny!

369
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.199
Walter!

370
00:36:46.957 --> 00:36:48.083
What?

371
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.091
- What happened?
- It's Lisa.

372
00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:04.850
Is she okay?

373
00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:16.736
Walter, do you think she's okay?

374
00:37:17.863 --> 00:37:21.032
I guess. She's still in one piece.

375
00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.618
What happened to the robot?

376
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.221
What are you doing?

377
00:37:43.805 --> 00:37:45.056
I think it's dead.

378
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:54.566
Get up here.

379
00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:48.995
Do you think the door
will hold the robot?

380
00:38:49.287 --> 00:38:50.330
No.

381
00:38:51.623 --> 00:38:52.749
Great.

382
00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:55.377
Yeah, once he fixes himself

383
00:38:56.169 --> 00:38:57.337
we're screwed.

384
00:38:58.213 --> 00:39:01.424
- He's fixing himself?
- How should I know?

385
00:39:12.185 --> 00:39:15.355
- Looks about right.
- You think she's okay?

386
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.190
I don't wanna be here
when she wakes up.

387
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:19.943
Where are you going?

388
00:39:22.946 --> 00:39:25.907
- I'm taking my turn.
- Are you crazy?

389
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:27.742
That thing's messed up.

390
00:39:31.872 --> 00:39:34.833
<i>You're promoted to fleet admiral.
Move ahead four spaces.</i>

391
00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:46.386
- Okay, your turn.
- I'm not playing.

392
00:39:53.935 --> 00:39:56.772
- What are you doing?
- Making mac and cheese.

393
00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.484
There's no water, dummy,
we're in outer space.

394
00:40:06.114 --> 00:40:07.616
Why are you doing that?

395
00:40:08.366 --> 00:40:10.911
Because I'm hungry and I know
you're not gonna take care of me.

396
00:40:11.661 --> 00:40:13.288
Don't bother, the gas won't work.

397
00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:19.419
Any more advice?
You've gotta turn it up more.

398
00:40:24.466 --> 00:40:26.009
Can we at least talk about this?

399
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.678
There's nothing to talk about,
I'm not going.

400
00:40:31.681 --> 00:40:36.019
Danny, I just wanna go home,
and I can't unless you play.

401
00:40:36.853 --> 00:40:38.188
Don't you wanna get home?

402
00:40:39.064 --> 00:40:40.774
What's so great about home, anyway?

403
00:40:40.857 --> 00:40:41.900
What do you mean?

404
00:40:41.983 --> 00:40:43.360
Everything was great
until you came along.

405
00:40:43.443 --> 00:40:46.238
See? You treat me
like everything's my fault.

406
00:40:46.321 --> 00:40:48.573
You're the one who pushed the button
in the first place.

407
00:40:49.282 --> 00:40:51.910
I just wanted to play
a game with you, Walter.

408
00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:54.579
Fine, what do you want?

409
00:40:56.123 --> 00:40:59.376
I want you not to be mean to me,
not ignore me

410
00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:01.336
and I want you
to treat me like your brother.

411
00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:02.504
Fine.

412
00:41:02.587 --> 00:41:05.507
- Do we have an understanding?
- Yeah.

413
00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:08.301
Wasn't that easy?

414
00:41:21.773 --> 00:41:22.899
Six.

415
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:38.665
- <i>You are visited by Zorgons.</i>
- What's a Zorgon?

416
00:41:39.416 --> 00:41:41.710
I don't think it's bad.
Just visitors.

417
00:42:05.984 --> 00:42:07.694
Zorgons!

418
00:42:46.942 --> 00:42:48.193
Maybe they're friendly.

419
00:42:51.905 --> 00:42:53.240
They're not friendly!

420
00:42:56.952 --> 00:42:59.496
The fireplace. Hide in the fireplace.

421
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:22.394
Run!

422
00:43:36.324 --> 00:43:39.202
Told you I didn't wanna go.
You're the one who made me spin.

423
00:43:39.286 --> 00:43:41.079
There's nothing else we could do.

424
00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:53.717
- Are you crazy?
- Got any better ideas?

425
00:44:05.812 --> 00:44:08.356
<i>Reprogram</i>?
What the heck does that mean?

426
00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.150
How am I supposed to know?

427
00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:15.489
Reprogram!

428
00:44:32.672 --> 00:44:33.965
It didn't work.

429
00:44:34.841 --> 00:44:36.092
We'll figure it out later.

430
00:44:43.975 --> 00:44:45.018
Go.

431
00:44:45.727 --> 00:44:47.562
- No.
- Go.

432
00:44:47.646 --> 00:44:49.314
- No!
- Go!

433
00:45:10.585 --> 00:45:14.923
<i>Rest on standing AstroTurf.</i>

434
00:45:15.048 --> 00:45:16.258
What?

435
00:45:16.341 --> 00:45:18.844
Rest on standing AstroTurf.

436
00:45:19.511 --> 00:45:21.263
- Let me read it.
- No, I know how to read.

437
00:45:21.346 --> 00:45:25.475
- I know how to read.
- Let me read it. God.

438
00:45:26.226 --> 00:45:30.021
- <i>Rescue stranded astronaut.</i>
- What stranded astronaut?

439
00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:32.315
I guess there's gonna be
some stranded astronaut or some...

440
00:46:03.722 --> 00:46:05.223
Did you lock the door?

441
00:46:06.725 --> 00:46:07.809
I don't know.

442
00:46:56.691 --> 00:46:58.235
Which one of you spun me?

443
00:47:00.195 --> 00:47:03.323
- Who was it?
- Him.

444
00:47:04.491 --> 00:47:06.618
Don't be so quick
to sell out your brother, kid.

445
00:47:06.701 --> 00:47:07.744
He's all you got.

446
00:47:12.958 --> 00:47:15.377
Looks like you got a pretty serious
Zorgon problem.

447
00:47:16.044 --> 00:47:17.337
Yeah, what do we do?

448
00:47:18.713 --> 00:47:19.756
Hide.

449
00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:23.135
Hide? They'll just explode
the whole house.

450
00:47:23.468 --> 00:47:24.719
We're gonna hide the house.

451
00:47:35.647 --> 00:47:38.066
Turn off all the lights
and electrical appliances.

452
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.318
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Do it.

453
00:47:42.112 --> 00:47:43.155
Okay.

454
00:47:46.116 --> 00:47:48.368
You. Come on,
kill that flame on the stove.

455
00:47:48.451 --> 00:47:49.494
Okay.

456
00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.840
Burning gas. That's probably
what brought them in the first place.

457
00:48:08.263 --> 00:48:09.306
Okay.

458
00:48:09.389 --> 00:48:11.141
Now get the pilot light
on the furnace.

459
00:48:11.766 --> 00:48:12.809
What's a pilot light?

460
00:48:13.518 --> 00:48:16.605
In the basement. Little blue flame
under the big heater.

461
00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:20.775
Blow it out like a candle. Like this.

462
00:49:14.287 --> 00:49:18.250
Walter, the astronaut guy
is wrecking dad's couch.

463
00:49:25.549 --> 00:49:26.716
Come on.

464
00:49:32.639 --> 00:49:34.224
That's dad's nap couch.

465
00:49:48.864 --> 00:49:50.282
You wanna help me
get this out of here?

466
00:50:09.927 --> 00:50:11.136
Hit it.

467
00:50:12.054 --> 00:50:13.222
Hit it.

468
00:50:13.973 --> 00:50:15.724
- What's happening?
- Come on.

469
00:50:16.767 --> 00:50:19.979
Take it. Follow it.

470
00:50:20.813 --> 00:50:22.189
Follow it.

471
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:26.986
There you go.

472
00:50:28.195 --> 00:50:29.238
That's it.

473
00:50:38.414 --> 00:50:39.582
Zorgons.

474
00:50:40.291 --> 00:50:44.837
They're big, gnarly lizards.
Cold-blooded heatseekers.

475
00:50:45.713 --> 00:50:48.966
And the tiniest spark of warmth
will bring them in like moths.

476
00:50:49.634 --> 00:50:50.927
Flying all around the galaxy

477
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:53.429
looking for anything they can find
to burn up.

478
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.765
Why don't they just burn up
their own planet?

479
00:50:55.848 --> 00:50:59.227
Oh, they already did.
That's not even the worst of it.

480
00:50:59.978 --> 00:51:02.355
The real problem
is their ravenous appetite.

481
00:51:03.022 --> 00:51:05.817
- They never stop eating.
- What do they eat?

482
00:51:06.693 --> 00:51:09.612
- Meat.
- That's good.

483
00:51:10.822 --> 00:51:13.324
Dude, you're meat.

484
00:51:43.313 --> 00:51:45.858
Are you doing this
to keep Zorgons away?

485
00:51:47.192 --> 00:51:48.235
Nope.

486
00:51:49.444 --> 00:51:51.113
I'm doing this
because I've been eating paste

487
00:51:51.196 --> 00:51:53.115
out of a tube for 15 years.

488
00:52:12.384 --> 00:52:14.678
- This totally sucks.
- Why?

489
00:52:15.221 --> 00:52:17.556
- He's eating all our food.
- So?

490
00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.350
Lupe just went shopping.

491
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:22.144
How long do you think
we're gonna be out here for?

492
00:52:22.228 --> 00:52:25.606
- It could be weeks. Then what?
- I don't know.

493
00:52:26.107 --> 00:52:27.233
What about air?

494
00:52:27.775 --> 00:52:29.652
How long is it gonna last
before he breathes it all up?

495
00:52:31.529 --> 00:52:34.157
- I guess.
- I'm gonna say something.

496
00:52:34.448 --> 00:52:37.160
No, wait. Walter.

497
00:52:39.245 --> 00:52:40.538
Dude, that's our food.

498
00:52:42.123 --> 00:52:45.168
Yep. And you're running low
on supplies.

499
00:52:46.169 --> 00:52:47.629
Yeah, I know. You're eating it all.

500
00:52:50.298 --> 00:52:53.968
Well, as I recall, the card said,
<i>Rescue stranded astronaut.</i>

501
00:52:54.469 --> 00:52:56.554
Looks to me like I'm the only one
that's doing any rescuing

502
00:52:56.638 --> 00:53:00.308
so I don't think a couple Dagwood
sandwiches is too much to ask for.

503
00:53:01.434 --> 00:53:02.644
Daug, you're eating it all.

504
00:53:05.563 --> 00:53:07.857
I passed through a time sphincter
to get here.

505
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.318
You realize how difficult that is?

506
00:53:10.402 --> 00:53:13.029
- What's a time sphincter?
- A wormhole.

507
00:53:13.738 --> 00:53:15.156
About yay big.

508
00:53:15.907 --> 00:53:17.284
You try squeezing through there

509
00:53:17.367 --> 00:53:19.619
and tell me you're not hungry enough
to eat a carpet shark.

510
00:53:20.996 --> 00:53:22.914
Sounds like you got
a long trip ahead of you.

511
00:53:24.583 --> 00:53:26.001
Oh, you telling me to leave?

512
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.464
Well, I mean,
once you get finished eating, yeah.

513
00:53:31.298 --> 00:53:33.675
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but that's not your call.

514
00:53:33.759 --> 00:53:36.470
He spun me, so it's up to him.

515
00:53:41.308 --> 00:53:43.894
Well, I'm fleet admiral,
and I'm telling you to hit the road.

516
00:53:48.941 --> 00:53:50.442
I apologize, sir.

517
00:53:50.526 --> 00:53:52.569
I didn't realize
you were a fleet admiral.

518
00:53:54.238 --> 00:53:55.364
In fact, I...

519
00:53:56.782 --> 00:53:58.993
I'm a fleet admiral too.

520
00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:01.495
It's just a card, bug nuts.

521
00:54:02.788 --> 00:54:04.081
Well, he wants you to leave too.

522
00:54:05.249 --> 00:54:07.126
That true, Danny?
You want me to split?

523
00:54:07.209 --> 00:54:08.252
Of course, he does.

524
00:54:08.335 --> 00:54:10.254
Hey, mouthpiece,
let him answer, all right?

525
00:54:10.337 --> 00:54:11.672
I need to hear it from the big guy.

526
00:54:13.591 --> 00:54:14.717
Well...

527
00:54:15.593 --> 00:54:17.219
Danny, tell him
you want him to leave.

528
00:54:17.678 --> 00:54:21.390
- Well, he did help out a little.
- Help?

529
00:54:22.099 --> 00:54:23.809
He burned our couch
and now he's eating all our food.

530
00:54:23.893 --> 00:54:24.977
You call that helping?

531
00:54:26.354 --> 00:54:27.480
You know what?

532
00:54:28.564 --> 00:54:29.899
I'm just gonna go.

533
00:54:29.982 --> 00:54:32.026
I feel like a third wheel anyways.

534
00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.530
I mean, you guys are such a tight,
unified team here.

535
00:54:35.613 --> 00:54:36.656
You're doing great too.

536
00:54:36.739 --> 00:54:39.742
I gotta tell you,
the house looks fantastic.

537
00:54:40.994 --> 00:54:42.704
So I'll just get out of your hair

538
00:54:42.787 --> 00:54:46.457
and let you guys whomp some more
Zorgon butt without me.

539
00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:47.584
Wait.

540
00:54:48.793 --> 00:54:50.503
Whose brother are you, his or mine?

541
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:03.725
You can stay.

542
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.688
Orders are orders.

543
00:55:09.856 --> 00:55:11.816
Come on, admiral, your turn.

544
00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:18.657
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

545
00:55:19.658 --> 00:55:20.909
I think he can help.

546
00:55:28.709 --> 00:55:29.751
Okay.

547
00:55:30.002 --> 00:55:33.338
- Why haven't you guys started yet?
- We're waiting for you.

548
00:55:33.422 --> 00:55:36.717
Okay, well, I'm here,
so turn that clockwise...

549
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.303
- Yeah, I know how to play the game.
- Okay.

550
00:55:42.598 --> 00:55:44.224
Hang on a second. Something's wrong.

551
00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:45.351
What?

552
00:55:46.935 --> 00:55:48.145
I was ahead of you.

553
00:55:49.897 --> 00:55:52.441
Somebody must have kicked the board?

554
00:55:52.524 --> 00:55:54.235
No, nobody kicked the board.

555
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.819
- You cheated.
- No, I didn't.

556
00:55:55.903 --> 00:55:57.238
You cheated. I knew you'd cheat.

557
00:55:57.321 --> 00:55:59.448
- Cheater's a strong word.
- I didn't cheat.

558
00:55:59.532 --> 00:56:03.119
- I didn't cheat!
- Guys. Please. Bring it down.

559
00:56:03.202 --> 00:56:06.205
Indoor voices.
Now, did you move the piece?

560
00:56:07.957 --> 00:56:13.045
Maybe I moved the piece
by an accident.

561
00:56:13.129 --> 00:56:14.964
Okay. It was an accident.

562
00:56:15.047 --> 00:56:16.424
How can you move a piece by accident?

563
00:56:16.507 --> 00:56:19.427
It's stuck to the game.
That's impossible. You cheated.

564
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:20.761
- No, let's not use that word.
- You cheated.

565
00:56:20.845 --> 00:56:21.929
- No, stop saying "cheated."
- You cheated.

566
00:56:22.013 --> 00:56:24.557
- You cheated! Cheater!
- I didn't cheat!

567
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.142
Hey. Come on.

568
00:56:26.517 --> 00:56:29.270
Okay? Now, where did you move from?

569
00:56:29.645 --> 00:56:32.690
- I was right here.
- No, you weren't.

570
00:56:32.774 --> 00:56:34.317
- You were back there.
- No.

571
00:56:34.776 --> 00:56:35.818
Okay.

572
00:56:37.195 --> 00:56:38.655
Okay. Here, careful.

573
00:56:40.865 --> 00:56:42.951
- God.
- Okay, it's fixed.

574
00:56:43.034 --> 00:56:44.077
- You're such a baby.
- Okay. Hey.

575
00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.495
- I'm not a baby.
- Slow down.

576
00:56:45.578 --> 00:56:46.996
- Yes, you're a baby.
- I'm not a baby.

577
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.499
- You're a baby.
- Nobody is a baby here.

578
00:56:49.582 --> 00:56:51.584
- I am not a baby!
- You're a little baby!

579
00:56:51.668 --> 00:56:53.420
I'm not a baby!

580
00:56:53.503 --> 00:56:56.548
Jeez, it won't stop! Please.

581
00:56:57.841 --> 00:57:00.385
- Okay, let's play the game.
- Fine.

582
00:57:08.268 --> 00:57:09.478
Won't stop spinning.

583
00:57:12.189 --> 00:57:14.066
- What's wrong with it?
- You broke it.

584
00:57:14.775 --> 00:57:17.611
Oh, look, there's the card.
See? It fixed itself.

585
00:57:19.613 --> 00:57:22.074
<i>Caught cheating. Automatic ejection</i>?

586
00:57:23.909 --> 00:57:26.578
- Does it mean me?
- Well, you did move the piece.

587
00:57:26.662 --> 00:57:27.788
He's the one who cheated.

588
00:57:32.543 --> 00:57:34.753
Walter!

589
00:57:41.635 --> 00:57:43.387
Hang on, Walter!

590
00:57:44.305 --> 00:57:45.639
I'll save you.

591
00:57:47.016 --> 00:57:48.142
Help!

592
00:57:49.351 --> 00:57:51.937
Wait a minute! I got an idea!

593
00:57:59.236 --> 00:58:01.489
I'm gonna swing this lamp up to you

594
00:58:01.572 --> 00:58:04.033
and you grab it,
and I'll pull you down.

595
00:58:04.116 --> 00:58:05.576
I can't hang on any longer!

596
00:58:11.082 --> 00:58:13.918
Don't worry, I'll get another lamp.

597
00:58:16.087 --> 00:58:17.213
Stand back.

598
00:58:36.816 --> 00:58:38.109
Walter?

599
00:58:46.159 --> 00:58:47.285
Walter.

600
00:58:56.419 --> 00:58:57.462
Oh, no.

601
00:59:14.521 --> 00:59:15.564
You okay?

602
00:59:17.983 --> 00:59:19.276
Are you okay?

603
00:59:22.446 --> 00:59:23.530
Get away from me.

604
00:59:27.618 --> 00:59:30.704
- Sorry.
- Don't talk to me till we get home.

605
00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:35.793
That look cool from down here?

606
00:59:36.293 --> 00:59:38.504
Because up there it was,
it was pretty intense.

607
00:59:38.587 --> 00:59:42.299
My heart's pumping pretty good.
That was fun.

608
00:59:42.383 --> 00:59:44.093
Can you just play
so I can get the heck out of here

609
00:59:44.176 --> 00:59:45.219
and get away from you?

610
00:59:45.678 --> 00:59:48.180
- I told him I was sorry.
- Whatever.

611
00:59:48.973 --> 00:59:50.307
Okay, you know what we need to do?

612
00:59:50.933 --> 00:59:52.476
We need to get our heads right, okay?

613
00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.603
Pull it together. As a team.

614
00:59:55.146 --> 00:59:56.230
The three of us.

615
00:59:57.064 --> 00:59:59.150
You're up, big man. Bring us home.

616
01:00:00.067 --> 01:00:02.612
I got you, buddy. I promise.

617
01:00:24.092 --> 01:00:26.052
- What's it say?
- He can't read.

618
01:00:30.682 --> 01:00:33.059
<i>Lose map of galaxy.
Go back two spaces.</i>

619
01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.408
I'm freezing my ass off.

620
01:00:49.117 --> 01:00:50.452
Forty degrees?

621
01:00:50.535 --> 01:00:51.995
Those savages.

622
01:01:08.553 --> 01:01:10.514
Yes. Nine.

623
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:13.475
- Good roll.
- Good roll?

624
01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:17.187
- Nine's a great roll.
- I meant great.

625
01:01:20.149 --> 01:01:21.442
It's gold.

626
01:01:26.655 --> 01:01:29.408
<i>Shooting star.
Make a wish as it passes.</i>

627
01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:32.077
That's gotta be the best card
in the whole game.

628
01:01:32.494 --> 01:01:34.955
I'm almost to the end, look.
A few more and I win.

629
01:01:35.998 --> 01:01:38.334
I hope you win.
I don't care who wins.

630
01:01:38.417 --> 01:01:39.877
Because you never win
at anything, Danny.

631
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.003
- Hey.
- What?

632
01:01:41.086 --> 01:01:42.755
That's why he cheats all the time,
'cause he can never win.

633
01:01:42.838 --> 01:01:44.256
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

634
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:45.841
And you almost got me killed.

635
01:01:45.925 --> 01:01:48.219
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's not your fault?

636
01:01:48.719 --> 01:01:50.179
How is it not your fault?

637
01:01:50.262 --> 01:01:53.015
This is all your fault.
Everything's your fault.

638
01:01:53.099 --> 01:01:54.976
It's your fault mom and dad
got divorced.

639
01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:56.936
- Hey.
- You suck.

640
01:01:58.938 --> 01:02:00.022
Danny.

641
01:02:08.448 --> 01:02:09.907
I get my wish now, don't I?

642
01:02:11.617 --> 01:02:12.785
Yeah.

643
01:02:28.927 --> 01:02:30.095
Don't do it.

644
01:02:32.055 --> 01:02:33.223
Don't do what?

645
01:02:34.224 --> 01:02:37.227
- Don't wish what you're thinking.
- You don't know what I'm thinking.

646
01:02:37.978 --> 01:02:39.938
Yeah, well, I can tell it ain't good.

647
01:02:43.942 --> 01:02:44.985
Listen.

648
01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:47.529
No matter how good an idea
seems like when you're angry

649
01:02:47.612 --> 01:02:48.655
it never is.

650
01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:50.365
You gotta trust me
on this one, Walter.

651
01:03:06.673 --> 01:03:07.716
What'd you wish for?

652
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:10.260
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

653
01:03:11.011 --> 01:03:13.305
You know the rules about wishing.
If I told you, it won't...

654
01:03:13.388 --> 01:03:15.849
- Tell me what you wished for.
- Get off me.

655
01:03:19.687 --> 01:03:20.771
Danny.

656
01:03:22.356 --> 01:03:23.524
Danny.

657
01:03:35.494 --> 01:03:36.745
The card worked.

658
01:03:38.122 --> 01:03:41.167
Yeah. It worked, congratulations.

659
01:03:41.459 --> 01:03:43.544
We're stuck in space now forever.

660
01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.505
Leave him alone.

661
01:03:52.887 --> 01:03:54.096
What did you wish for?

662
01:03:55.765 --> 01:03:58.559
- This.
- You wished for a football?

663
01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:03.147
- Signed by Brett Favre.
- Why'd you wish for a football?

664
01:04:03.856 --> 01:04:05.733
You could have just wished
the game over.

665
01:04:05.817 --> 01:04:07.193
You could have wished us out of here.

666
01:04:07.819 --> 01:04:10.947
I was under a lot of pressure.
He was yelling at me.

667
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.451
Why were you yelling at him?

668
01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:23.585
Okay, guys. Here's the thing.

669
01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:27.547
I've played this game before.

670
01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:30.175
Okay?

671
01:04:30.759 --> 01:04:33.386
I played it with my own brother
15 years ago.

672
01:04:33.845 --> 01:04:37.015
- You're a player?
- Yeah. Just like you guys.

673
01:04:37.766 --> 01:04:39.893
We were fighting a lot back then.

674
01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:43.355
And when the game started,
it got even worse.

675
01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:47.484
Every time we spun, we got madder
and madder at one another.

676
01:04:47.567 --> 01:04:50.112
And then I landed on the star space.

677
01:04:50.195 --> 01:04:52.280
The same one that Walter
just landed on.

678
01:04:53.073 --> 01:04:57.411
Well, I was so mad at him,
that when the star passed...

679
01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.497
I made my wish.

680
01:05:01.957 --> 01:05:03.250
What'd you wish for?

681
01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:06.753
I wished that my brother
had never been born.

682
01:05:07.463 --> 01:05:11.175
- Oh, my god.
- Soon as I did it, I felt horrible.

683
01:05:11.258 --> 01:05:14.094
I thought, you know,
if I could spin again, maybe I...

684
01:05:14.178 --> 01:05:17.598
I could land on another star space
and wish him back.

685
01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:22.228
But the game wouldn't let me
because it wasn't my turn.

686
01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:25.147
Walter.

687
01:05:25.898 --> 01:05:29.151
There are some games
you can't play alone.

688
01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.030
So, what do we do now?

689
01:05:33.489 --> 01:05:37.368
We go back downstairs and we finish
this thing once and for all.

690
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:39.912
No more cheating. No more arguing.

691
01:05:39.996 --> 01:05:42.915
All you guys have to do
is spin a few more times.

692
01:05:42.999 --> 01:05:45.042
I'll help you fight off
whatever comes out.

693
01:05:45.543 --> 01:05:46.586
Deal?

694
01:05:47.628 --> 01:05:49.672
- Deal.
- Deal.

695
01:05:51.799 --> 01:05:52.967
Is it getting hot in here?

696
01:05:55.428 --> 01:05:57.430
You blew out the pilot light
on the furnace, right?

697
01:06:03.895 --> 01:06:04.979
Stay put.

698
01:06:26.001 --> 01:06:27.085
Zorgons.

699
01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.172
My gerbil was in there.

700
01:06:32.132 --> 01:06:33.258
This is bad.

701
01:06:34.509 --> 01:06:35.677
This is very bad.

702
01:06:36.803 --> 01:06:40.474
- Why? We didn't get eaten.
- Where did you leave the game?

703
01:06:43.226 --> 01:06:44.770
In the living room.

704
01:06:46.229 --> 01:06:50.859
Great. The game's our only way home,
and now the Zorgons are burning it.

705
01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:53.737
There is one thing we can do.

706
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:02.162
Waiting for an invitation? Come on.

707
01:07:12.381 --> 01:07:14.216
- Put your back into it.
- Come on.

708
01:07:17.803 --> 01:07:19.221
Why are we doing this?

709
01:07:40.826 --> 01:07:41.911
Walter?

710
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.467
You guys actually
set the house on fire!

711
01:07:56.551 --> 01:07:58.803
- Lisa's back.
- Lisa's unfrozen.

712
01:07:58.886 --> 01:07:59.929
You're okay.

713
01:08:00.013 --> 01:08:02.432
- You're okay, Lisa.
- Get off me!

714
01:08:02.515 --> 01:08:04.851
Get off me!
Try and find the fire extinguisher!

715
01:08:04.934 --> 01:08:06.603
No, Lisa, wait.

716
01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:09.355
- No, Lisa, no.
- Stop! Lisa, don't.

717
01:08:09.439 --> 01:08:11.608
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire.
- Lisa, stop.

718
01:08:11.691 --> 01:08:13.818
No, Lisa, don't do it!

719
01:08:13.902 --> 01:08:15.904
Lisa, don't do that.
We gotta keep the fire.

720
01:08:15.987 --> 01:08:19.783
- The Zorgons are attracted to fire!
- Lisa, wait. No, Lisa, don't do it.

721
01:08:19.866 --> 01:08:21.076
No, Lisa.

722
01:08:24.287 --> 01:08:27.040
- Great.
- Now we'll never get the game back.

723
01:08:27.457 --> 01:08:31.002
Okay. Don't worry. They're back.

724
01:08:31.545 --> 01:08:33.588
- Who the hell are you?
- The astronaut.

725
01:08:34.423 --> 01:08:35.674
From the game we're in.

726
01:08:36.758 --> 01:08:37.968
Danny spun me.

727
01:08:47.644 --> 01:08:50.439
What is that?

728
01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:52.941
What's going on? Where are we?

729
01:08:53.984 --> 01:08:55.986
Somebody please talk to me right now!

730
01:08:57.529 --> 01:08:59.615
All right,
they're arming the harpoons.

731
01:09:00.324 --> 01:09:01.533
They're gonna board us.

732
01:09:01.617 --> 01:09:03.577
- What's gonna board us?
- Guys, look alive, okay.

733
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:05.704
- What's gonna board us?
- The Zorgons.

734
01:09:05.788 --> 01:09:06.872
What's a Zorgon?

735
01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:10.584
They're lizard-men. They eat meat.
We're meat!

736
01:09:16.799 --> 01:09:18.467
Come on you guys,
let's hide downstairs!

737
01:09:18.551 --> 01:09:19.760
Okay, listen, when they dock

738
01:09:19.844 --> 01:09:22.221
I'm gonna sneak on the ship
and steal the game. Got it?

739
01:09:22.304 --> 01:09:23.347
- Hang on.
- What?

740
01:09:23.431 --> 01:09:25.808
- Did she say downstairs?
- Oh, no.

741
01:09:39.071 --> 01:09:40.114
Hey.

742
01:09:40.198 --> 01:09:43.117
Just stay with us,
and everything will be okay.

743
01:09:47.246 --> 01:09:48.539
I'll never leave you.

744
01:09:55.255 --> 01:09:56.881
Move.

745
01:10:00.802 --> 01:10:02.345
Go!

746
01:10:40.676 --> 01:10:43.762
Okay. It's gotten
pretty serious out there.

747
01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:47.349
I need you guys to hide in here.
I'll keep in touch with these.

748
01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:49.476
They're not gonna work.
Danny broke them.

749
01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.937
He pulled off the antenna.
They're completely destroyed.

750
01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:55.858
Testing.

751
01:10:56.942 --> 01:10:57.985
It works.

752
01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.741
Listen, keep the volume low.
Only use that if you need me.

753
01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:08.037
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm gonna go find the game.

754
01:11:19.465 --> 01:11:20.925
He has gorgeous eyes.

755
01:11:24.345 --> 01:11:25.429
What?

756
01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.808
He obviously feels
very protective over me.

757
01:11:30.935 --> 01:11:34.564
I just feel so safe around him.

758
01:11:35.356 --> 01:11:37.859
<i>Zorgons. Oh, my god.</i>

759
01:11:38.234 --> 01:11:41.571
<i>The place is crawling with them.
They're all over the basement.</i>

760
01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:45.074
<i>Wait, I think in the corner
I see the game.</i>

761
01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:47.493
<i>Yeah, the box is right there.</i>

762
01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:50.788
<i>Hang on, I'm gonna get closer.</i>

763
01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:55.418
Did he get the game?

764
01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:04.928
- Hello?
- What's going on?

765
01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:07.263
Are you there? Hello?

766
01:12:07.347 --> 01:12:09.391
- What's happening?
- Hello?

767
01:12:09.474 --> 01:12:10.809
Is he dead?

768
01:12:45.386 --> 01:12:47.012
The game was right there.

769
01:12:48.472 --> 01:12:49.932
It was right across from the furnace.

770
01:12:50.015 --> 01:12:51.058
I couldn't get it.

771
01:12:52.226 --> 01:12:55.521
There's too many of them down there.
They're all over the basement.

772
01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:58.691
- Are there any upstairs?
- Not yet.

773
01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.693
But as soon
as they're done down there...

774
01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:02.486
It's okay. You tried your hardest.

775
01:13:03.154 --> 01:13:05.156
- We believe in you.
- Will you please?

776
01:13:07.324 --> 01:13:08.409
Okay.

777
01:13:08.993 --> 01:13:11.746
- The dumbwaiter.
- What?

778
01:13:11.829 --> 01:13:14.540
The dumbwaiter is across
from the furnace.

779
01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:16.417
It's a little elevator.

780
01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.671
You could sneak right in it,
we'll lower you down

781
01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:25.092
you could grab the game
and we'll pull you right back up.

782
01:13:25.843 --> 01:13:31.224
- So easy. Right, Walter?
- Yeah, but he's too big.

783
01:13:32.225 --> 01:13:35.645
- Yeah.
- It was a good plan, though.

784
01:13:36.062 --> 01:13:37.438
It was a great plan.

785
01:13:38.064 --> 01:13:40.358
- Yeah, it was.
- It was.

786
01:13:40.733 --> 01:13:44.195
- Too bad he wouldn't fit.
- I wouldn't even fit.

787
01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.287
I sure wish we knew someone
that was small enough.

788
01:13:54.247 --> 01:13:56.416
Do we really need the game?

789
01:14:07.636 --> 01:14:08.845
How you doing in there?

790
01:14:11.765 --> 01:14:12.808
Okay.

791
01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.019
Listen to me.
It's gonna be real easy, okay?

792
01:14:16.603 --> 01:14:18.855
Just gonna lower you down there,
grab the game

793
01:14:18.939 --> 01:14:19.981
and we'll pull you up.

794
01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:21.608
Yeah.

795
01:14:21.692 --> 01:14:23.402
Nothing's gonna happen to you, okay?

796
01:14:24.528 --> 01:14:26.613
- Yeah.
- Because I'm your brother.

797
01:14:27.197 --> 01:14:28.782
And that's what being
a brother means.

798
01:14:30.075 --> 01:14:31.869
Means I'll never let
anything happen to you.

799
01:14:32.244 --> 01:14:34.455
- Okay?
- Yeah.

800
01:14:35.747 --> 01:14:38.709
Okay. This is just gonna take
a few seconds, okay?

801
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.420
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

802
01:14:42.671 --> 01:14:46.216
- I'm sorry I cheated.
- I know.

803
01:14:52.389 --> 01:14:54.725
- You ready to do this?
- I'm ready.

804
01:15:52.575 --> 01:15:53.994
He's right there.

805
01:15:54.995 --> 01:15:57.163
<i>Guys, why did you stop?</i>

806
01:16:10.969 --> 01:16:16.099
Guys, come on.
I'm not at the bottom yet.

807
01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.569
Help me. Come on.

808
01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:34.159
That's it. Pull. Come on. Go.

809
01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:42.084
They're back.

810
01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:47.756
- They're coming up the stairs.
- Get out of here. Go on. Go.

811
01:17:34.429 --> 01:17:35.805
Oh, no.

812
01:18:19.141 --> 01:18:22.686
Guys. It was just the box.

813
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.283
Wait.

814
01:18:37.034 --> 01:18:38.369
I see the game.

815
01:18:39.245 --> 01:18:40.871
It's on the Zorgon ship.

816
01:18:46.293 --> 01:18:48.129
But I think I can get it.

817
01:18:50.256 --> 01:18:54.510
<i>Danny, do not get on that ship.
Just stay put.</i>

818
01:18:54.593 --> 01:18:55.636
<i>We'll come and get you.</i>

819
01:19:53.862 --> 01:19:54.905
<i>Danny.</i>

820
01:19:56.406 --> 01:19:59.409
<i>Danny, listen to me.
The Zorgons are up here.</i>

821
01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:02.079
<i>Just stay put. The pulley broke...</i>

822
01:20:02.287 --> 01:20:05.248
<i>Figure out... We got rope...
So just stay put.</i>

823
01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:11.338
<i>Danny, are you there?
Danny, the Zorgons are up here.</i>

824
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.259
<i>If you can hear me, listen.
We're not pulling you up right now.</i>

825
01:20:15.843 --> 01:20:19.555
<i>Stay put. We just saw one.
Hold tight.</i>

826
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:59.679
It's just a goat.

827
01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:07.979
It's not a goat.

828
01:21:10.481 --> 01:21:11.816
It's not a goat.

829
01:22:50.041 --> 01:22:52.335
Guys, pull me up.

830
01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:58.549
They got goats with four eyes.

831
01:23:47.391 --> 01:23:50.519
Guys! Quick! I have the game!

832
01:23:52.771 --> 01:23:53.855
Come on.

833
01:23:55.691 --> 01:23:56.733
Walter.

834
01:23:57.276 --> 01:23:59.987
I told you I wouldn't let anything
happen to you. Come on.

835
01:24:21.759 --> 01:24:23.469
Emergency.

836
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:31.018
Alien life form. Must destroy.

837
01:24:31.852 --> 01:24:33.270
He still wants to kill me.

838
01:24:40.611 --> 01:24:42.655
Use the card. Quick.

839
01:24:43.531 --> 01:24:44.574
Reprogram.

840
01:25:03.801 --> 01:25:05.595
Alien life form.

841
01:25:08.556 --> 01:25:09.849
Must destroy.

842
01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:40.130
Alien life form.

843
01:25:40.213 --> 01:25:41.757
Must destroy.

844
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:49.097
Guess that's what
the reprogram card's for.

845
01:25:50.432 --> 01:25:53.477
- I like that card.
- It's a good card.

846
01:25:55.938 --> 01:25:57.064
Where's Lisa?

847
01:26:03.153 --> 01:26:06.156
Lisa is upstairs.

848
01:26:06.657 --> 01:26:07.741
What fell?

849
01:26:11.704 --> 01:26:14.832
Little excessive, but I like it.
Come on.

850
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.126
Come on.

851
01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.218
Okay, spin it, buddy.

852
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:37.104
Almost there.

853
01:26:41.859 --> 01:26:42.902
I got it.

854
01:26:44.278 --> 01:26:47.407
<i>Flunk space academy.
Go back one space.</i>

855
01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:53.413
I'm not even gonna comment on that.

856
01:26:56.291 --> 01:26:57.417
My turn.

857
01:27:16.186 --> 01:27:18.146
<i>Hit time warp. Go back three spaces.</i>

858
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:19.314
<i>Repeat last turn.</i>

859
01:27:29.574 --> 01:27:30.909
I get another wish.

860
01:27:51.263 --> 01:27:52.473
Thanks for helping us out.

861
01:28:04.276 --> 01:28:06.779
I wish the astronaut
had his brother back.

862
01:28:35.433 --> 01:28:38.853
- You wished for two of me?
- No. I...

863
01:28:38.936 --> 01:28:41.022
I wished the astronaut guy
had his brother back.

864
01:28:48.613 --> 01:28:50.740
- Danny.
- Who are you?

865
01:28:51.908 --> 01:28:52.951
It's me.

866
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:56.830
It's Walter. I'm your brother.

867
01:28:56.913 --> 01:28:59.249
- What?
- What?

868
01:28:59.332 --> 01:29:02.460
No, you're not. He is.

869
01:29:04.003 --> 01:29:07.465
Yes. I'm older, but I'm him.

870
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:10.969
- I came back for you.
- What's going on here?

871
01:29:57.933 --> 01:29:59.602
That was awesome.

872
01:30:08.652 --> 01:30:09.695
Thank you.

873
01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:11.906
I...

874
01:30:12.615 --> 01:30:14.283
- I didn't...
- You did a good job.

875
01:30:15.242 --> 01:30:16.702
You did better than I did.

876
01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:19.622
Thanks.

877
01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:22.458
Now, make sure
he gets home safe, okay?

878
01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:24.168
Okay.

879
01:30:54.073 --> 01:30:56.367
- He was me.
- Yeah.

880
01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:57.494
Oh, my God.

881
01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:58.953
And I wanted to...

882
01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:20.183
- Ten. You need ten to win.
- Need a ten.

883
01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:35.908
One. God, I suck.

884
01:31:45.459 --> 01:31:48.462
<i>Would you like to swing on a star?
Move ahead nine spaces.</i>

885
01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:52.841
- Danny, you won.
- I won?

886
01:31:52.925 --> 01:31:54.802
- He won?
- You won, Danny. You beat the game.

887
01:31:55.344 --> 01:31:57.221
- You won the game.
- We can go home.

888
01:31:57.304 --> 01:31:58.722
I reached Zathura!

889
01:32:40.306 --> 01:32:43.476
<i>Game over. Thank you for playing</i>?

890
01:32:44.644 --> 01:32:47.313
- That's it?
- Now what?

891
01:33:05.499 --> 01:33:06.666
I think we're home.

892
01:33:11.588 --> 01:33:12.672
Walter!

893
01:33:17.969 --> 01:33:19.805
Lisa!

894
01:33:28.981 --> 01:33:30.899
It's a black hole!

895
01:33:31.358 --> 01:33:33.902
Zathura is a black hole!

896
01:34:10.982 --> 01:34:14.068
Danny!

897
01:34:15.236 --> 01:34:20.241
No!

898
01:34:22.452 --> 01:34:26.873
<i>Two-run shot.
Are you kidding me? A's up 5-4.</i>

899
01:34:26.956 --> 01:34:29.042
<i>Keith Foulke leads the bigs
in home runs</i>

900
01:34:29.125 --> 01:34:31.044
<i>given up by a reliever with six.</i>

901
01:34:31.127 --> 01:34:33.296
<i>Bottom nine. Red Sox down, 5-4.</i>

902
01:34:33.379 --> 01:34:37.133
<i>Octavio Dotel in for the save.
He ain't really saving a whole lot.</i>

903
01:34:37.217 --> 01:34:40.011
<i>He walks Big Papi Ortiz
to tie up the inning.</i>

904
01:34:40.094 --> 01:34:42.013
<i>Kevin Millar up next.</i>

905
01:34:43.306 --> 01:34:46.184
<i>After an Ortiz walk, ninth inning...</i>

906
01:34:46.768 --> 01:34:47.811
Walter?

907
01:34:49.145 --> 01:34:50.855
Don't push that button.

908
01:34:50.939 --> 01:34:52.399
<i>Let's get back to the here and now.</i>

909
01:34:52.482 --> 01:34:54.943
<i>No way it's gonna happen again,
is it? No way.</i>

910
01:34:55.026 --> 01:34:58.405
<i>No, it doesn't happen again.
Millar pops out to left field.</i>

911
01:35:10.917 --> 01:35:12.294
Richard's back!

912
01:35:13.211 --> 01:35:14.922
- I did it.
- You won the game.

913
01:35:15.005 --> 01:35:16.673
- I won the game.
- We're home.

914
01:35:16.757 --> 01:35:18.508
- I beat Zathura.
- We're home!

915
01:35:18.592 --> 01:35:19.801
We did it. We're home.

916
01:35:19.885 --> 01:35:23.055
I distinctly remember asking you guys
not to kill each other.

917
01:35:23.138 --> 01:35:24.223
- Dad!
- Dad, it was so awesome.

918
01:35:24.348 --> 01:35:25.390
There was this game,

919
01:35:25.474 --> 01:35:26.725
- it sent us to outer space.
- There is alien.

920
01:35:26.809 --> 01:35:28.018
- There was a black hole.
- Everything go blast.

921
01:35:28.102 --> 01:35:29.228
- We almost had to stay forever.
- And there were these Zorgons.

922
01:35:29.311 --> 01:35:32.189
- I stole the game from the Zorgons.
- And I saw myself older.

923
01:35:34.233 --> 01:35:35.567
Sounds like a lot of fun.

924
01:35:36.402 --> 01:35:38.904
Listen, it's almost 3.00,
and mom's gonna be here any minute.

925
01:35:38.988 --> 01:35:40.197
So, grab all games and books

926
01:35:40.281 --> 01:35:41.574
whatever you wanna take to her house.

927
01:35:41.657 --> 01:35:42.950
Come on, get ready to go.

928
01:35:46.287 --> 01:35:49.248
Good throw.
Right to the chest. Catch this one.

929
01:35:50.708 --> 01:35:52.460
- Caught it.
- Nice.

930
01:35:55.338 --> 01:35:56.797
All right, ready? Here we go.

931
01:35:57.757 --> 01:36:01.302
Brett Favre takes the snap.
He's looking. It's a great pass.

932
01:36:01.928 --> 01:36:03.638
- Touchdown.
- Touchdown.

933
01:36:05.097 --> 01:36:06.390
- Just a second, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

934
01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:11.979
What happened to the football
signed by Brett Favre?

935
01:36:12.063 --> 01:36:14.399
- It's gone.
- What happened to it?

936
01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.484
It never happened.

937
01:36:17.652 --> 01:36:18.736
Oh, right.

938
01:36:21.155 --> 01:36:23.241
We never speak of this. Okay?

939
01:36:24.492 --> 01:36:26.703
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

940
01:36:29.539 --> 01:36:31.416
Still think I have gorgeous eyes?

941
01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:33.585
- Walter.
- What?
