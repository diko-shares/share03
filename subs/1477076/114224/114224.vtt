00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,401
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>And here's what's</i>

2
00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:02,377
<i>been going on</i>
<i>in my life lately.</i>

3
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:04,630
This is a not

4
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:05,670
a real attack, is it?

5
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:06,873
No, this is our competition.

6
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,981
Verbanski Corp took all
of our clients.

7
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,419
Told you.
You put me out there,

8
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:11,656
you don't have
to worry

9
00:00:11,692 --> 00:00:12,827
about what other
companies are doing.

10
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,728
Morgan needs a handler.

11
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:14,562
What? Who, me?

12
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,138
You be my handler. Yeah!

13
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,745
Just because you have
the Intersect in you

14
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,513
doesn't mean you don't have
something to learn still!

15
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:21,914
I have something
I can offer you

16
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:23,049
no one else can.

17
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:36,896
Okay, target acquired.

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,432
Distance to intercept:
100 meters.

19
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,834
This is it. You ready, Casey?

20
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:44,837
Readiness-- like life--

21
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,439
begins at the point
of conception.

22
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:47,807
Where am I headed?

23
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:49,776
Other side of the street.
You should be hitting a one-way.

24
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,878
Head south
to initiate intercept.

25
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,312
Roger that.

26
00:00:53,347 --> 00:00:55,548
You okay? Your blood pressure
just went through the roof.

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,551
I'm fine.

28
00:00:58,585 --> 00:00:59,685
How much time till intercept?

29
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,038
Steady. In five,

30
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:03,923
four, three,

31
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,958
two, one.

32
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:08,411
John!

33
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,079
Gertrude, hey.

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,365
What are the chances?

35
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,533
Her favorite restaurant is

36
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:16,886
a block away,
a raw bar called Cerulean.

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,106
I was just, uh,
going around the corner

38
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,441
to that little oyster bar.

39
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:24,811
Cerulean-- that... that is
my favorite restaurant.

40
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,112
What are the chances?

41
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:28,581
Wow!

42
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,283
You know, I could really go

43
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:32,051
for some Blue Points
right about now.

44
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:34,120
Did you hear that?

45
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:35,238
The target is yours.
Ask her out.

46
00:01:35,272 --> 00:01:36,856
She practically
just asked you out.

47
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,658
Blue Points are delicious.

48
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:40,993
Especially with a little
mignonette sauce.

49
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:43,062
Boy, that's
the best thing

50
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,131
the damn French ever gave us.

51
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:48,501
Come on, Casey.

52
00:01:49,937 --> 00:01:53,773
Well, it was great
talking to you.

53
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:56,309
No, wait! Just give a kiss
on the cheek.

54
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:58,511
Just let her know you're
available and interested!

55
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,347
I guess I'll, uh,

56
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:02,765
see you around?

57
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,433
Come on!

58
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:05,852
Yes...

59
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:13,726
So you froze up.

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,862
It happens
to the best of us.

61
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,597
No, I didn't freeze.

62
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:18,931
Then what do
you call that?

63
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,032
Reconnaissance.

64
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:22,318
Wait. You planted a bug
on Verbanski?

65
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,872
Mm-hmm. Piggybacks off
her cell phone's Wi-Fi.

66
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,473
That's a weird
move, Casey.

67
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:29,575
This way I can find out
everything I need to

68
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,077
before I ask her out.

69
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,379
I'm pretty sure that's why
people go on dates,

70
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:35,581
to get to know one another.
Just do me a favor,

71
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:37,316
don't tell Chuck
and Morgan about it.

72
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:38,551
Lips are sealed.

73
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:46,342
How many triple words are
you gonna leave open, Jeff?

74
00:02:46,393 --> 00:02:47,960
My God, he's dumb.

75
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:48,828
Morgan...

76
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,029
Boom! 87 points, huh?!

77
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,597
It's good to be
the Intersect.

78
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:53,132
Please, buddy,
we're on a mission.

79
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,967
Oh, right. Sorry.

80
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,370
I thought we were just sitting
in some Burbank parking garage.

81
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:59,906
Oh, I'm sorry, you got
somewhere you need to be?

82
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,674
I have a hot date.
No biggie.

83
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,042
If this is how you choose

84
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,851
to use the world's greatest
super-computer. Well...

85
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:08,418
Okay, okay, this is
actually what I needed

86
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,049
Hmm?
to talk to you about.

87
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,118
Um, the attitude.

88
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,020
Am I not the world's
greatest...?

89
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,688
Being the Intersect doesn't mean
you have to constantly talk

90
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:16,856
about being the Intersect.

91
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,192
You did it your way,
I'll do it my way.

92
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,761
- Morgan!
- Chuck!

93
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:23,296
I hate to say it, buddy,

94
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,830
but you're starting
to remind me

95
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:26,499
of seventh-grade Morgan,
and I think

96
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,334
we both know
what happened to him.

97
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,139
Stay here.

98
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,609
Got it, boss.

99
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:44,183
It's good to see you again.

100
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,252
I trust you
and your team are well?

101
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,853
Hanging in there, yeah.

102
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:50,556
Turns out working in
the private sector is...

103
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,892
Look, I think it's better
if we keep this brief.

104
00:03:52,926 --> 00:03:54,927
No offense.

105
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:57,463
You've heard of Mats Zorn?

106
00:03:57,497 --> 00:03:59,398
Yeah, rich guy with
the whistleblower Web site?

107
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:02,134
Makes WikiLeaks look like
child's play.

108
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,370
A number of classified
CIA memos have fallen

109
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,805
into Zorn's hands.

110
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,540
So, you want us to grab Zorn?

111
00:04:07,574 --> 00:04:09,141
And the documents.

112
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:10,543
The drive contains
his itinerary.

113
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,144
Zorn doesn't stay
in one place

114
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:13,646
any longer than
it takes refuel,

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,114
but we have him
passing through L.A.

116
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,882
This is a paying gig, right?

117
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:18,985
There's a sizeable
bounty on Zorn.

118
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,920
I'm outsourcing to your team
to circumvent the leak.

119
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:23,723
My only condition is
that no one breathes my name

120
00:04:23,757 --> 00:04:24,724
in relation
to the mission.

121
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,060
Yo, Becky!

122
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,630
What up, baby girl?

123
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:32,198
I told you to come alone.

124
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,800
You doing Pilates, huh? You are,
don't say you're not. You are.

125
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,669
What the hell is wrong with him?

126
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,838
So many things.

127
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,640
Becky, your core's really tight.

128
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,181
Alex?

129
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:50,182
Oh, hey.

130
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,917
I thought you were Morgan.

131
00:04:51,952 --> 00:04:54,120
No, I just dropped
him off at the Buy More.

132
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,221
What?

133
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,456
Guess he forgot about our plans.

134
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,624
I wouldn't say that.

135
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,693
I mean, he did mention
having a hot date, so...

136
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:04,297
Well, clearly it's
with someone else.

137
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,799
Is there something going on
between you two?

138
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:11,437
You would tell me if Morgan's
seeing someone else, right?

139
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:16,108
Yes. And no, he is not.

140
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:19,178
He's had a lot on his mind
lately, that's all.

141
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:21,447
Let me track him down and talk
some sense into him, okay?

142
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,449
Okay.

143
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:24,317
Chin up.

144
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,785
Thanks.

145
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,659
Oh, hey. How'd it go
with the general?

146
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,177
Piece of cake.

147
00:05:35,228 --> 00:05:37,730
Data drive with the mission's
locked up tight in Castle.

148
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:39,799
- So what's the problem?
- Morgan.

149
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,301
I tried to have
a heart-to-heart with him

150
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,670
about his...
Overblown ego?

151
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,038
Anyway, he went AWOL.

152
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:48,641
Casey, can you can help
with a surveillance detail?

153
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:51,711
Casey, what you looking at?

154
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:52,845
Nothing.
None of your business.

155
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,980
Ooh, you got a wire up on
someone, huh?

156
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:56,282
Who is it?

157
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:57,550
Verbanski.

158
00:05:57,584 --> 00:05:59,318
Corporate espionage.
He's just sizing up

159
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,686
the competition,
that's all.

160
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,987
Perving out on Gertrude.

161
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:03,389
Weird move, Casey.

162
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:04,657
I told you.

163
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,860
So, have you
considered my offer?

164
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:09,661
Gertrude, do me a favor.

165
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,997
What is he doing
in her office?

166
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:13,599
That's a good question.

167
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:16,385
Next time you make me an offer
like that to me,

168
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:18,837
why don't you go ahead and spit
in my face instead?

169
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:19,872
Thank you, Morgan.

170
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,558
Bubala...

171
00:06:22,609 --> 00:06:26,512
I offer you the services
of the world's greatest spy,

172
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,948
and you don't have
the decency,

173
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:31,784
the common courtesy
to offer me my own...

174
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:34,754
personal assistant?

175
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,855
Bush league.

176
00:06:36,873 --> 00:06:39,692
You drive a hard bargain,
Mr. Grimes.

177
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,360
Yeah, I try.

178
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:45,714
Welcome to Verbanski Corp.

179
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,203
You little...

180
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:52,772
...traitor.

181

Hey, what are you doing?
It's so early.

191
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,355
I couldn't really sleep,

192
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,991
so I figured I'd head
into the office early.

Well, why didn't
you wake me?

194
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:53,413
I mean, we could have
talked about it.

195
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:56,917
I know what Morgan
did hurt you.

196
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,669
I'm not, uh... hurt.

197
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,804
I'm just angry.

198
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:02,806
You know, the Intersect
is an integral part

199
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,142
of our business,
and Morgan just sold it

200
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,244
to our number-one rival.

201
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,847
Morgan is also
your best friend.

202
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:13,683
I'm trying not to think
about that right now.

Okay, her bottle is
on the counter.

204
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,307
There's two more in the fridge
that need to be warmed up.

205
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:21,758
Clara eats every two hours,

206
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,944
and, normally, she lets you know
she's full by spitting up.

207
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,112
Oh, that's my girl.

paternity leave,
it's just...

211
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:30,767
It's just feeding, burping
and wiping.

212
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,985
I think
I got it, babe.

213

You know your daddy climbed
Matterhorn,

Okay, I know
you're tough,

216
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,942
but being with a baby all day
is a different kind of tough.

217
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,043
So you pace yourself.

Oh, sure it is.

323
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:13,382
His new powers-- they pushed
him to the Dark Side.

324
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,218
He doesn't have
a dark side.

325
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,088
It's like middle school
all over again.

326
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,058
Like when Morgan grew
his first mustache--

327
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,993
full, thick, manly.

328
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:26,162
Like a miniature Tom Selleck.

329
00:13:26,197 --> 00:13:28,064
Thought he was
cock of the walk.

330
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:30,800
Cool, sarcastic, mean.

331
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:33,253
Made our lives a living hell
for a few weeks.

332
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:35,288
That is, until Meredith Lester
showed up.

333
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,742

334
00:13:39,744 --> 00:13:41,678
No, she did not, no.

335
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,891
One day in gym class, Meredith
snuck up behind Morgan

336
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,516
and pantsed him
in front of everyone.

337
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:48,284
Exposed him
for who he really was.

338
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,587
We went back to being
uncool by fifth period.

That's it!

341
00:13:55,526 --> 00:13:57,727

Morgan's pants?

342
00:13:57,762 --> 00:13:59,329
Metaphorically, yes.

as he thinks he is, and...

346
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,436
And you'll be best friends
by the end of the day?

347
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,954
Exactly.

348
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:14,544

00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:27,623
The little bearded bastard
stole it. He stole our mission.

354
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:29,596
He probably took it with him
to Verbanski Corp.

355
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,828
I can't believe...

356
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:34,786
Morgan just pantsed us!

357
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:38,790
What are you two doing?

358
00:14:38,825 --> 00:14:41,059
We're taking down
our competition.

359
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,848
Anybody work here anymore?

360
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:16,911
Don't worry, Clara, I'm going to
find someone to look after you.

361
00:15:16,946 --> 00:15:19,531
Lester, come here.

362
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:22,500
Guard this child
with your life.

363
00:15:22,535 --> 00:15:24,652
The Chosen One.

364
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,955
Hey...

365
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,378
Come on,
I got you, man.

366
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:35,096
Hey, what's the big idea?

367
00:15:35,131 --> 00:15:36,297
Get up, Jeff.

368
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:37,515
Use your legs.

369
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,035
I am going to take
a knife and fork

370
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,236
and just eat those
chubby little cheeks.

371
00:15:41,237 --> 00:15:43,071
Yes, Uncle Lester...

372
00:15:43,138 --> 00:15:44,906
What are you doing, man?
You're scaring her.

373
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,174
No.

374
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,191
Okay? And what are you doing?

375
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,476
Are you trying to kill yourself?

376
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,311
I'm just taking off
the exhaust pipe,

377
00:15:50,346 --> 00:15:52,046
trying to squeeze

378
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,915
a few more horses
out of the beast.

379
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,833
Ever hear of carbon monoxide,
hmm, guys?

380
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:56,979
Can't leave your engine running.

381
00:15:57,004 --> 00:15:58,304
No, he has to leave
the engine running

382
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,754
or he can't start it up again.

383
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:02,557
And the engine noise
helps me sleep.

384
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,959
Hold up. Are you telling me
that you sleep in your van

385
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:06,060
with the engine running?

386
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,197
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

387
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,849
Jeff, you need to see
a doctor, man.

388
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,101
I'm worried you might

389
00:16:13,135 --> 00:16:14,335
have damaged your brain.

390
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,637
No, Jeffrey doesn't have
a brain, silly-pants.

391
00:16:16,672 --> 00:16:18,523
Listen, just give me a call--
I'll give you a quick consult.

392
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,242
- Really?
- Caught me on a slow week.

393
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:24,212
Okay, Clara, let's go, honey.

394
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,230
- No, five more minutes.
- Come on, Clara. Thanks, though.

395
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,915
Five more minutes.

396
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,400
Come on... yeah.
Thank you.

397
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:33,388
My biological clock
is tick-tocking.

398
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:58,262
You realize this is
breaking and entering.

399
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,481
Verbanski can shoot
us all with impunity.

400
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:02,400
Well, her little goon
Grimes stole our mission.

401
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,918
We're going to
steal it back.

402
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:06,720
So this has nothing to do with revenge
against Gertrude and Morgan?

403
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:07,955
Absolutely not.

404
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,590
If we don't get
the bounty on Zorn,

405
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,992
Carmichael Industries
goes belly up.

406
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:12,994
And if we don't stop Zorn
from posting those files,

407
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:14,996
no telling how many agents
are going to get burned.

408
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,497
Fine. Where are we going?

409
00:17:16,532 --> 00:17:19,417
The zip drive's in
your girlfriend's office, Casey.

410
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:20,620
The only problem is
getting through the door.

411
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:21,845
Roger that.

412
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:24,755
I can infiltrate.
You two take down security.

413
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:32,763
You sure that's a good idea?

414
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,184
Well, I mean, you know,
you and Verbanski.

415
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:37,919
There is no me and Verbanski.

416
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,922
Coming from the guy who put
a surveillance bug on her.

417
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,473
That was before she
poached one of my team.

418
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:43,608
That woman is dead to me.

419
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:46,310
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

420
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:49,931
Come on, let's grab
their uniforms.

421
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,008
Casey, Verbanski's office
is on your right.

422
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:02,210
Don't touch the handle.

423
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,130
What's the holdup?

424
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,548
Just accessing the system.

425
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,250
Okay, go.

426
00:18:27,002 --> 00:18:28,186
Ah...

427
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,076
<i>What is he doing?</i>

428
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,644
I have no idea.

429
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,616
Casey, we are on a bit
of a schedule here.

430
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:47,455
Casey, is everything
okay in there?

431
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:50,675
Yeah, A-OK.

432
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,477
Casey, you've got incoming.

433
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:12,713
Bingo.

434
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:16,534
Let's start with
the Zorn mission briefing.

Scotty, what is this?

436
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:22,540
A tall soy latte
with two Splendas.

437
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,158
Soy? Who said anything
about soy?

438
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,627
What do you want me to do,
start lactating for you?

439
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:28,596
I'm not sure what you mean.

440
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,732
I asked for almond milk.
Al-mond milk.

441
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,902
You megalomaniacal
little bastard.

442
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,537
Okay? Please fix it.

443
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:37,555
Yes, sir.

444
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,307
This is the best
Harvard has to offer?

445
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:43,945
Casey, watch out,
it's Verbanski.

446
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:49,567
Got it. Let's move.

448
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,961
Nothing.

00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,534
Sorry, Morgan.

531
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:25,170
God, I love the Intersect.

532
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:30,225
Oh, really?

533
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,961
That's what
we're going to do here?

534
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,189
Zorn arrives
in L.A. tonight.

535
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,041
Business meeting
downtown.

536
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:47,443
Just enough
time for him

537
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,745
to switch planes
and disappear.

538
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,697
Whoa. Let me see
that last tail number.

539
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:53,866
Helicopter.

540
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,517
I'll pull up satellite
on the address.

541
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,722
Looks like a helipad to me.
That's where we'll grab him.

542
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:02,424
Carmichael Industries will be
seven figures in the black.

543
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,159
Won't be long till we're
the new Verbanski Corp.

544
00:26:04,177 --> 00:26:06,795
Guys, I think we should talk
about Morgan and Gertrude.

545
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:08,347
I told you, Walker,
she's dead to me.

546
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:11,800
Well, then, how do you explain
whatever that was

547
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,886
in her office?

548
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:15,521
Clearly, you still
have feelings for her.

549
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,356
And you-- I know
what Morgan did hurt you,

550
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,841
but you saw the way
he was behaving.

551
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,109
I really think
it's time to admit

552
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:21,510
this is more than just
an ego problem.

553
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:22,728
Pure seventh-grade Morgan.

554
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:24,113
But what if it's not?

555
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,881
What if Morgan needs help?

556
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,416
Sarah, he said that we're
not friends anymore,

557
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,251
so how am I supposed
to help him now?

558
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,323
So, Jeff, when's the last time

559
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,557
you saw a doctor?

560
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,092
Um...

561
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:40,329
when was the last time
I got something stuck up in me?

562
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,600
Okay, just going to ask you
a few questions.

563
00:26:44,634 --> 00:26:45,968
All right, Jeff.

564
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:47,586
Have any trouble
focusing?

565
00:26:47,637 --> 00:26:49,555
Mmm...
Whoa. Yeah.

566
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,708
Ow. Okay.

567
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:54,309
That's a yes.

568
00:26:54,344 --> 00:26:56,378
Any problems with your
short-term memory, Jeff?

569
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:59,081
Uh... hey, Doc.

570
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:02,217
Do you know
I'm cha-cha under here?

571
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:04,086
All right, buddy,
keep the gown down.

572
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,689
Do you have any trouble
performing at work?

573
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:07,890
I got that one.

574
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:09,942
We're going to mark that
as a yes as well.

575
00:27:09,993 --> 00:27:11,777
All right, I'm just
going to write you

576
00:27:11,828 --> 00:27:15,064
a script here, buddy,
and get you on your way.

577
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:17,082
Should take care of
all your problems.

578
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,618
Goody. Pills.

579
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,937
Stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.

580
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:23,205
Okay?

581
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,807
Doctor's orders.

582
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,008
<i>What are you saying?</i>

583
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,242
<i>Is there something wrong</i>
<i>with Morgan?</i>

584
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,944
Well, I just...

585
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,713
I-I feel like he's
losing himself.

586
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:32,114
I mean, why would
the Intersect

587
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:33,716
act so differently
in Morgan's head

588
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,916
versus Chuck's head?

589
00:27:34,934 --> 00:27:36,251
Well, because it's
a different program.

590
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:38,053
Somebody modified
Dad's original.

591
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,055
Look, if you think
that there's something wrong,

592
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,607
you should have
the CIA remove it.

593
00:27:41,641 --> 00:27:43,925
Yeah, I just don't think
he's going to go for that.

594
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:46,428
Like I said, Morgan is not
acting like Morgan at all.

595
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:48,363
Well, you need to try
to get through to him.

596
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:49,865
How?

597
00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:52,301
Well, you could try
to appeal to his memory.

598
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:54,336
You know, I've had
temporal lobe patients

599
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,537
who've responded to stories

600
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:57,072
about who they were
before the injury.

601
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,341
It doesn't
return them to normal,

602
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,610
but it sort of helps them
cut through the fog--

603
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:02,944
in this case, the Intersect.

604
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,447
Gives them a glimpse
of who they used to be.

605

<i>Agent Walker,</i>

606
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:08,484

607
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:10,285
No. This isn't about Zorn;
it's about the Intersect.

608
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:11,787
It's malfunctioning in Morgan.

609
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:14,289
Morgan Grimes has the Intersect?

610
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:15,724
Look, it was a mistake.

611
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,526
Remember the glasses
that you sent to us

612
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,344
after we took down Volkoff?

613
00:28:19,395 --> 00:28:20,763
Listen to me, Walker.

614
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:23,165
I never sent you
Intersect glasses.

615
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:26,635
What? Well, then, who did?

616
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:27,969
Ready, Casey?
Let's go.

617
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:29,304
Where you
been, Walker?

618
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,739
Zorn's not going
to wait for us.

619
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:32,357

It's about Morgan.

620

The Intersect that he uploaded,
it wasn't from her.

What? Then, who?

622
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:37,312
Decker or somebody else
in the CIA. She doesn't know.

623
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:39,348
Why would anyone want
to hurt Morgan?

You.

625
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:43,185
- It was meant for you.
- I spoke to your sister,

626
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,053

is not his fault.

627
00:28:45,088 --> 00:28:46,822

00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:26,425
with the bad-ass tips
and you're the dorky sidekick!

705
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:31,931
Ladies, please stop fighting!

706
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:33,432
Shut up!

707
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:39,205
Can't you see it?

708
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,673
Can't you feel the
Intersect changing you?

709
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,375
That's-That's why you're not
acting like yourself.

710
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:45,078
Why would I want
to act like myself? Huh?

711
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:46,579
Do you even remember
who I was before?

712
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,414
Yes, Morgan!

713
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,516
Do you?

714
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,361
Holy hell! Is that real?

715
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,830
Turn off the engine, Zorn!

716
00:33:07,835 --> 00:33:08,634
Aah.

717
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:13,873
Stop the engine or I will
blow us all to hell!

718
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:20,013
Morgan, you're not a killer.

719
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:21,948
Shut up, Chuck, okay?
How would you know?

720
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:24,484
Because you got
pantsed by

721
00:33:24,518 --> 00:33:26,319
Meredith Lester
in seventh grade.

722
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:27,654
Chuck, you've got to unlock
his memory.

723
00:33:27,688 --> 00:33:30,173
I don't even remember
seventh grade.

724
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,124
Sure you do.

725
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:32,458
Put the gun down, Morgan,

726
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:34,360
and try to remember
what she did to you.

727
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,329
Even if I did remember,
Chuck-- why?

728
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,764
Why would I want to remember

729
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,632
being humiliated
by some stupid girl?

730
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,384
Because then you'd remember
how we got back at her.

731
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,636
What do you mean "we"?
Yeah, "we."

732
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,071
I'm your best friend.
Always have been.

733
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:46,706
Who else would have
helped you stand up

734
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,074
to the queen of eighth grade?

735
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,729
What did we do, exactly?

736
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,348
We stole Meredith's ham sandwich
during homeroom,

737
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,349
and then we...

738
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,683
Did something to it.

739
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:58,985
Yeah...

740
00:33:59,019 --> 00:34:00,519
we spiced it up somehow.

741
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,854
Yes. Yes!

742
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:02,739
You're right, Morgan.

743
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,240
But what did
we put in it?

744
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,326
Something... it was something
really, really awful.

745
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,627
I can see it in my head.

746
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:08,711
I can't, I just,
I can't, it's like a...

747
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,081
gnarly, curly...
like a cockroach leg...

748
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:13,499
my-my mustache!

749
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,334
Yes!

750
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,969
We shaved off my first mustache

751
00:34:16,003 --> 00:34:17,554
and we sprinkled it
on her sandwich!

752
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,704
I remember now.

753
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:21,341
Chuck, I... I remember.

754
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,009
That's who you are.

755
00:34:23,043 --> 00:34:24,911
That's who I am.

756
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:29,349
Please... take me to jail.

757
00:34:30,317 --> 00:34:32,068
You're all a bunch of maniacs.

758
00:34:35,422 --> 00:34:37,223
You cuff him,
I'll grab the case.

759
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,325
Does that mean
we split the bounty?

760
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,997
I'm sure we can
work something out.

761
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:49,035
Gertrude... can I...
can I have a minute?

762
00:34:50,404 --> 00:34:51,738
Oh...

763
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,841
Listen, I just wanted
to say thank you

764
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,175
for the opportunity,

765
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,594
but I don't think
it's gonna work out.

766
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:01,781
Ah, poor kid. That's tough.

767
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:09,589
Morgan!

768
00:35:14,761 --> 00:35:15,612
Oh, God...

769
00:35:21,735 --> 00:35:23,269
The auxiliary tank's gonna blow
the whole roof!

770
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:27,740
Hey, Chuck!

771
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:05,745
I knew you were
into me, John.

772
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:07,246
Shut up, Gertrude.

773
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,669
Thank God.

774
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,960
Still friends.

775
00:36:22,997 --> 00:36:24,063
No.

776
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:26,432
Of course.

777
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:29,402
Thank you.

778
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:30,703
Thanks for pantsing me.

779
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,423
Anytime, buddy.

780
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:35,475
Anytime.

781
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,929
You're gonna be late.

782
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,630
If I take the Smith and Wesson,

783
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:55,200
it'll show her that
I'm rugged and dependable.

784
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,035
Maybe the Sig,

785
00:36:57,069 --> 00:36:58,870
she'll think I'm
cool and sophisticated.

786
00:37:00,206 --> 00:37:01,089
I'll just take 'em both.

787
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,408
So you're taking Verbanski
to the gun range

788
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:06,177
on your first date?

789
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,295
Weird move, huh?

790
00:37:07,346 --> 00:37:09,581
No, I think she's
going to love it.

791
00:37:09,615 --> 00:37:10,682
Well, good luck.

792
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:12,450
Sure you don't want
to tag along,

793
00:37:12,484 --> 00:37:13,585
follow in the van?

794
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,019
I am wired for sound.

795
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:17,422
I think this is
a solo mission.

796
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:19,157
Yeah.

797
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:20,191
Thanks, Walker.

798
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:23,111
Hey.

799
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,481
Is Casey wearing
Morgan's cologne?

800
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:27,966
Unfortunately.

801
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,767
- What's this?
- Courtesy of General Diane Beckman

802
00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:31,269
and the United States
government.

803
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:32,437
Our bounty money
for Zorn.

804
00:37:32,471 --> 00:37:34,172
Wow. That's a lot of zeroes.

805
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:35,439
That's just the
beginning, honey.

806
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:37,542
Carmichael Industries
has a new lease on life.

807
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:38,793
Wonderful.

808
00:38:06,071 --> 00:38:08,773
Dude, quick,
give me five bucks.

809
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:10,241
Why do you need
five dollars?

810
00:38:10,276 --> 00:38:12,343
'Cause Fernando says
that if we give him 20,

811
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:14,279
he's gonna let me
Taser his nads.

812
00:38:15,648 --> 00:38:17,949
Is that a good idea?

813
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,784
What do you care if something's
a good idea of not.

814
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:20,752
Could I have the
money, please?

815
00:38:20,786 --> 00:38:23,821
It just sounds...
really dangerous.

816
00:38:23,856 --> 00:38:25,707
Yeah. I know.
What if we kill him?

817
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:26,791
That's totally
worth 20 bucks.

818
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:28,493
I will not be party

819
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:30,728
to the reckless endangerment
of a coworker.

820
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:34,098
And, if I might add,
a friend.

821
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,883
What is going on with you?

822
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:37,668
Dude... are you high?

823
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:38,736
What'd you take?

824
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:40,071
Far from it, Lester.

825
00:38:40,105 --> 00:38:41,940
In fact, I'm seeing
things clearly

826
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:43,708
for the first time
in a long time.

827
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:44,909
Now, if you'll excuse me,

828
00:38:44,944 --> 00:38:47,278
I have to go put my
quinoa salad in the fridge.

829
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:52,683
Quin...?

830
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:55,036
Good news--
your vitals look fine.

831
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,754
Good.

832
00:38:56,789 --> 00:38:58,456
I don't feel fine, though.

833
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,907
And I certainly haven't been
acting fine.

834
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,025
Don't worry, Morgan.

835
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,660
I know a very good
brain doctor.

836
00:39:02,694 --> 00:39:06,064
Almost... almost lost myself
to this thing in my head,

837
00:39:06,098 --> 00:39:07,532
so I want it out,
you know?

838
00:39:07,566 --> 00:39:10,034
But, uh, to be honest,
I... I don't know.

839
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:11,886
Part of me thinks
I'll kind of miss it.

840
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,639
The Intersect
made me this-this, like,

841
00:39:14,673 --> 00:39:16,808
super cool super-spy, you know?

842
00:39:16,842 --> 00:39:18,309
Now I go back to
being some schmuck

843
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:19,811
who works at the
Buy More, you know?

844
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:21,546
I know how you feel.

845
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,381
- You do?
- Yeah.

846
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,552
You know, when I first
became a stay-at-home dad,

847
00:39:27,586 --> 00:39:29,554
I lost my identity.

848
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:32,023
You mind if I give you
a word of advice, bro?

849
00:39:32,057 --> 00:39:33,558
Of course, dude, yeah.

850
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:34,726
Please. Fire away.

851
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,161
Don't confuse
a job with your life.

852
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,231
Thanks.

853
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:47,772
How'd that date
with my ex-boss go?

854
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:49,007
What do you want?

855
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:52,276
Uh... to apologize.

856
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:54,429
The Intersect made
me a total jerk.

857
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:55,763
Not that it was completely
the Intersect's fault.

858
00:39:55,798 --> 00:39:57,682
I mean, it just kind of
brought out my inner jerk.

859
00:39:57,716 --> 00:39:59,117
Who knew?

860
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:02,520
Anyway, my point is,
I'm sorry, you know?

861
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,222
I'm sorry that I
ever left the team,

862
00:40:04,256 --> 00:40:06,057
I'm sorry that I
took the zip drive,

863
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:07,291
but most importantly,

864
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:11,429
I am really sorry
for what I did to Alex.

865
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,364
I was just a bozo.

866
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:17,035
So what do you say, roomie?
Huh?

867
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,569
Another chance?

868
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:24,876
You know, I'll just...

869
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,445
The couch maybe, or...?

870
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:29,780
Morgan.

871
00:40:29,798 --> 00:40:30,948
Hi. Sorry.

872
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:31,966
Casey kicked me out.

873
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,301
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey.

874
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:34,469
Let me talk to him.

875
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:37,889
No, no, no, no...
I kinda had it coming.

876
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:39,390
So...

877
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:40,825
Well, okay, where are
you gonna live?

878
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,628
I don't know, but that's cool.

879
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:46,564
Jeff said that I could, uh,
crash in his van.

880
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:48,232
You know that he's not
using it now.

881
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,467
You know? So...

882
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:51,402
Yeah, I'll be
all right.

883
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:53,471
You know, just till
I get on my feet.

884
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,774
Absolutely not, Morgan.

885
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,243
You're gonna stay with us.

886
00:40:59,278 --> 00:41:01,612
Guys, I... I mean, after
everything that's...

887
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:02,914
I don't know what to say.

888
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:04,449
Say you're gonna lose
the frosted tips.

889
00:41:04,483 --> 00:41:05,783
Okay, fine.

890
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:09,620
Oh.

891
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:12,173
Well, lookie
who's back in business.

892
00:41:12,207 --> 00:41:13,991
Beckman must have been
so impressed

893
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:15,326
with how we handled Zorn,

894
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,879
she's got a nice, big, juicy
contract waiting for us.

895
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,097
Fantastic, man! Great!

896
00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,331
Can I take Scotty back on?

897
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,299
Mm-mm.

898
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,300
I'm kidding.

899
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,502
He's... I don't even...

900
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,937
But he's kinda...
did you meet him?

901
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:27,572
He's just kind of a...
he's a good kid.

902
00:41:27,606 --> 00:41:28,606
Mm-mm.

903
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:39,717
We have another problem, Chuck.

904
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:40,868
There's something I thought
you should see.

905
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:46,190
This is a kill order.
This has gotta be a mistake.

906
00:41:46,225 --> 00:41:48,993
Morgan told anyone who wanted
to hear he had the Intersect.

907
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:50,928
The CIA does
not like that.

908
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:51,929
It was a mistake.

909
00:41:51,964 --> 00:41:52,830
C-Can't you call it off?

910
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:54,298
This goes way above my head.

911
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,167
Decker...

912
00:41:56,201 --> 00:41:58,503
He wants Morgan dead.

913
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:03,474
Get Morgan off
the street-- now.

914
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:04,342
Protect him.

915
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,393
Protect your friend, Chuck.

916
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,185
<i>Come on, Morgan, pick up.</i>

917
