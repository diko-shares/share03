00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:32.843
Hello, Mr. Hindle,

2
00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:36.324
or as they called you
around the hospital, Zepp.

3
00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:43.524
Game over!

4
00:02:35.296 --> 00:02:36.696
Check it, man.

5
00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:05.019
What the fuck is this?

6
00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.139
What the fuck are you doing here?

7
00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.419
What the fuck are you doing here?

8
00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:10.959
I'm fucking stuck.

9
00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.239
Yeah, me too.

10
00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.899
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

11
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.180
Somebody, help us.

12
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.380
- Hello.
- Come on, help us!

13
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.060
Oh, my God!

14
00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:27.498
Dina.

15
00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:28.778
Brad.

16
00:03:29.278 --> 00:03:32.198
- Ryan?
- Baby, are you okay?

17
00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:34.358
- Get me out of here!
- Baby.

18
00:03:34.478 --> 00:03:36.839
Help us. Somebody help us!

19
00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.599
Hey! Call the police!

20
00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:41.199
Hey, break the glass with your case.

21
00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.399
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

22
00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:44.959
Stay back!

23
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.520
Do it!

24
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.760
- Get me out of here.
- Break it!

25
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.461
Hello, Brad.

26
00:03:57.601 --> 00:04:00.561
Hello, Ryan. I'd like to play a game.

27
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.561
The same woman
has played each of you for a fool,

28
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.642
manipulating your love for her,
and causing nothing but pain.

29
00:04:08.762 --> 00:04:14.962
Her fun and games pushed you both to
break the law to fulfill her material needs.

30
00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:16.123
She is toxic,

31
00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:21.043
and today all of your transgressions
will be made public.

32
00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:22.603
He's fucking lying, Brad.

33
00:04:22.683 --> 00:04:26.524
Now you must choose who
will drop out of this triangle,

34
00:04:26.644 --> 00:04:29.804
for within 60 seconds one of you must die.

35
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.204
If you wish to save her,
then the saws must be pushed

36
00:04:34.284 --> 00:04:36.965
all the way to one side or the other,

37
00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:41.685
sparing her while proving for good
who is indeed the alpha male.

38
00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:44.245
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

39
00:04:44.365 --> 00:04:46.486
- Do something!
- Are you both strong enough

40
00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:49.206
to walk away from what is destroying you,

41
00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:52.886
or will you fight one more time
for the heart that binds?

42
00:04:53.686 --> 00:04:55.766
You have 60 seconds to decide.

43
00:04:56.167 --> 00:04:58.487
Live or die. Make your choice.

44
00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:02.467
Oh, fuck!

45
00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:11.148
One of you save me!

46
00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.349
What the fuck are you doing?

47
00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:23.029
It's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

48
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:36.651
Brad. Brad.

49
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:38.811
Brad, I love you.

50
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.131
I love you too, baby.

51
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:43.251
Do it. You gotta do it.

52
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.091
- What?
- You gotta kill him, Brad.

53
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:47.212
- Do it!
- Stupid bitch!

54
00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:49.652
Do it. Do it! Do it!

55
00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:01.953
Aw, Fuck!

56
00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:05.893
You love him?

57
00:06:06.214 --> 00:06:07.374
No, no.

58
00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:08.854
You love him more than me?

59
00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:11.054
No, I had to say that.

60
00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.054
I've always loved you.

61
00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:15.574
You got to do it for me, please.

62
00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:18.375
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

63
00:06:19.055 --> 00:06:20.815
You lying slut!

64
00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:23.215
What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:06:23.335 --> 00:06:24.375
You don't love anybody!

66
00:06:25.895 --> 00:06:27.656
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

67
00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:28.936
Fuck you!

68
00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.776
Brad! Brad, look at me!

69
00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:36.257
Is the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

70
00:06:36.777 --> 00:06:38.597
She's not worth it,
 man. She's not worth it.

71
00:06:38.657 --> 00:06:40.257
Right?

72
00:06:42.257 --> 00:06:43.297
Yeah!

73
00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:45.657
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

74
00:06:45.937 --> 00:06:47.898
I think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

75
00:06:50.538 --> 00:06:52.698
No! No, stop!

76
00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.379
- Stand aside!
- Move it!

77
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.900
People, get out of the way.

78
00:07:30.828 --> 00:07:32.188
Somebody help her.

79
00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:05.219
Game over.

80
00:08:05.299 --> 00:08:07.620
No! No, you fucking bitch!

81
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.180
No!

82
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.050
Tonight, a house of horrors
has been discovered

83
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.330
at what used to be known
as the Rowan Zoological Institute.

84
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.611
The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified

85
00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:00.011
as one of the several victims
of this grizzly crime scene.

86
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:02.291
However, we have also been
informed that there may be

87
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:05.571
as many as seven survivors
from this deadly event.

88
00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:07.732
Hopefully the many questions
of the local police,

89
00:10:07.852 --> 00:10:11.012
the FBI, and the victims'
family members may be answered

90
00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:13.132
by those seven civilians lucky enough

91
00:10:13.252 --> 00:10:15.412
to walk away from
this unprecedented display

92
00:10:15.532 --> 00:10:17.453
of carnage with their lives.

93
00:10:17.573 --> 00:10:21.813
We now go live to Tony Gabrielson
who is reporting from the scene. Tony.

94
00:10:27.494 --> 00:10:29.414
- Hey, man.
- Hey, what's up?

95
00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:34.214
- What have we got here?
- That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

96
00:10:34.294 --> 00:10:35.374
What does she want?

97
00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:37.355
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBI,

98
00:10:37.975 --> 00:10:40.135
- and she didn't trust homicide.
- Good.

99
00:10:40.935 --> 00:10:42.895
And she just wants to talk to you.

100
00:10:44.255 --> 00:10:46.816
- Why me?
- I don't know. Only you, though.

101
00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.816
Jeez, she looks
crazier than a sack full of cats.

102
00:10:54.816 --> 00:10:57.177
All right, let's get this over with.

103
00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:05.297
Hey. I put cream and sugar in it.

104
00:11:06.218 --> 00:11:08.018
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:11:08.138 --> 00:11:10.458
I'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

106
00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.958
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

107
00:11:12.978 --> 00:11:14.038
Yes.

108
00:11:15.218 --> 00:11:17.219
But I need complete immunity.

109
00:11:19.139 --> 00:11:21.099
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

110
00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.619
Because of what I know.

111
00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:26.660
Which is what?

112
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.700
Do we have a deal?

113
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.300
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

114
00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:39.981
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

115
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:43.501
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

116
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:44.981
Look, don't get me wrong.

117
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:48.942
I'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

118
00:11:50.662 --> 00:11:53.262
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

119
00:11:53.942 --> 00:11:57.303
- You know him and he definitely knows you.
- Is that right?

120
00:11:58.423 --> 00:11:59.983
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

121
00:12:01.823 --> 00:12:03.623
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

122
00:12:04.343 --> 00:12:05.343
Yes.

123
00:12:05.863 --> 00:12:07.064
You swear to be totally open?

124
00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:09.824
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

125
00:12:09.944 --> 00:12:11.004
Yes.

126
00:12:11.464 --> 00:12:13.984
I'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

127
00:12:14.944 --> 00:12:18.625
as long as I have your protection,
and complete immunity.

128
00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:20.945
Do we have a deal?

129
00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.305
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

130
00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.029
Welcome back!

131
00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:04.069
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

132
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:06.870
S.U.R.V.I.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw

133
00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:08.950
rolls into town this weekend.

134
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.190
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

135
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.590
Well, thank you, ma'am.

136
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.431
It's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

137
00:13:17.511 --> 00:13:22.351
And if I can help a few people
along the way, then I'm pleased.

138
00:13:22.431 --> 00:13:26.632
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

139
00:13:26.932 --> 00:13:27.952
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:13:28.032 --> 00:13:31.392
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

141
00:13:33.672 --> 00:13:35.192
Life changing.

142
00:13:35.312 --> 00:13:37.393
It was something I never anticipated

143
00:13:37.473 --> 00:13:39.993
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

144
00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:43.553
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

145
00:13:43.673 --> 00:13:46.474
I actually have no recollection
of how I got there.

146
00:13:47.074 --> 00:13:49.074
I just remember the feeling

147
00:13:49.154 --> 00:13:51.354
of waking up trapped.

148
00:13:52.194 --> 00:13:56.074
And I had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

149
00:13:56.195 --> 00:13:57.595
and hoist myself up to a platform.

150
00:13:57.715 --> 00:13:58.955
You put the hooks in yourself?

151
00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:00.615
I did.

152
00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:03.755
I pretty much realized
that I couldn't hold on much longer,

153
00:14:05.195 --> 00:14:09.316
and I had to accept the fact
that I was going to die.

154
00:14:09.436 --> 00:14:11.516
And then I saw something,

155
00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:13.076
and what I saw was my life.

156
00:14:14.156 --> 00:14:17.277
It was a tragedy. I achieved nothing.

157
00:14:19.197 --> 00:14:23.517
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

158
00:14:24.717 --> 00:14:27.038
something from the bottom of my soul.

159
00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:30.918
And I just... I decided to live.

160
00:14:30.998 --> 00:14:33.758
I found a strength that I thought
had long since expired.

161
00:14:33.878 --> 00:14:36.479
And I just yanked, and I yanked!

162
00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.639
And when I got to the top,
I just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

163
00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:43.359
There was blood everywhere,
and I just screamed.

164
00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:46.880
I just sat there and screamed.

165
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.600
Because I hadn't just survived,

166
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.360
I was reborn.

167
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.320
This was my life.

168
00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:01.281
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

169
00:15:01.961 --> 00:15:04.321
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

170
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.961
This is the moment.

171
00:15:06.402 --> 00:15:08.482
- Where's the big kiss?
- I don't know.

172
00:15:08.602 --> 00:15:10.002
Tickets are still available.

173
00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:11.922
And we're out, folks.

174
00:15:11.942 --> 00:15:14.422
- That's not the way it's supposed to be.
- You need to relax.

175
00:15:14.602 --> 00:15:16.002
No, we
rehearsed it differently.

176
00:15:18.283 --> 00:15:20.163
It's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

177
00:15:21.043 --> 00:15:23.043
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

178
00:15:24.923 --> 00:15:26.764
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

179
00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:28.324
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

180
00:15:28.404 --> 00:15:29.604
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

181
00:15:29.724 --> 00:15:31.204
I just didn't want to push it, all right?

182
00:15:31.324 --> 00:15:33.004
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

183
00:15:33.324 --> 00:15:35.364
She was there for your whole recovery.

184
00:15:35.484 --> 00:15:38.045
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

185
00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:40.325
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

186
00:15:40.445 --> 00:15:41.365
I disagree.

187
00:15:41.485 --> 00:15:43.205
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

188
00:15:43.285 --> 00:15:45.285
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

189
00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:46.446
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

190
00:15:46.566 --> 00:15:49.206
Okay, I get it, Suzanne, all right?
It's my fault.

191
00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:51.566
It wasn't your fault, Bobby.

192
00:15:51.686 --> 00:15:53.086
You were fine.

193
00:15:53.206 --> 00:15:54.986
- Just remember your bullet points
next time. - I will.

194
00:15:55.006 --> 00:15:56.247
These interviews are important.

195
00:15:56.367 --> 00:15:58.047
Nina, relax.

196
00:15:58.127 --> 00:15:59.287
Don't worry about them.

197
00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:00.807
You were great.

198
00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:02.087
Yeah?

199
00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:04.047
Your story's real and people feel that.

200
00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:09.728
I know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

201
00:16:11.888 --> 00:16:13.808
You were meant to do this.

202
00:16:17.529 --> 00:16:19.889
I know. I know, baby.

203
00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:22.849
- Bobby.
- Yeah?

204
00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:24.669
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

205
00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:26.610
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

206
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.410
Yeah, sounds good.

207
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.050
- Nothing more exciting than that.
- No, not much. Let's go.

208
00:17:12.174 --> 00:17:14.454
Oh, God!

209
00:17:14.694 --> 00:17:17.115
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

210
00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:20.135
I can only do it once.

211
00:17:29.776 --> 00:17:30.796
Oh, my God!

212
00:17:41.657 --> 00:17:42.677
No!

213
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.780
Help me! Help me!

214
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.260
Help! Fuck!

215
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.741
Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.

216
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:21.301
The situation you find yourself in
is of your own doing.

217
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:25.661
You, your girlfriend,
and your friends are all racists.

218
00:18:27.102 --> 00:18:28.982
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

219
00:18:29.382 --> 00:18:33.102
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

220
00:18:33.182 --> 00:18:36.343
But today it is you who will run scared.

221
00:18:36.423 --> 00:18:40.343
Your pathetic friends
follow your every word, Evan.

222
00:18:40.463 --> 00:18:46.424
Therefore you will be the only one capable
of saving them and yourself.

223
00:18:48.424 --> 00:18:52.344
In 30 seconds,
the jacks holding up this car will fall,

224
00:18:54.504 --> 00:18:56.785
setting off a deadly chain of events.

225
00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:58.905
In order to stop this from happening,

226
00:18:59.025 --> 00:19:04.145
you must tear yourself away
from the seat to which you are glued.

227
00:19:04.225 --> 00:19:09.746
Then you must pull the red lever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.

228
00:19:09.786 --> 00:19:12.546
You've judged others
by the color of their skin,

229
00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:18.787
and today, Evan, you will learn that
we are all the same color on the inside.

230
00:19:19.187 --> 00:19:22.027
Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.

231
00:19:26.308 --> 00:19:27.468
No!

232
00:19:33.748 --> 00:19:35.788
- Evan, help!
- I can't.

233
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:40.389
- Do it. Fuck!
- Fucking do it!

234
00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:41.909
Just fucking do it!

235
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:43.829
Do it! Do it, man!

236
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:44.949
Here I go!

237
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.590
Evan!

238
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.470
Baby, get me out of here!

239
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.631
Shit! Fuck! Here I go!

240
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.311
Here I go! Come on!

241
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:00.591
Fuck me!

242
00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:06.432
Please!

243
00:20:16.032 --> 00:20:18.593
- God!
- Do it! Fucking do it!

244
00:20:18.713 --> 00:20:20.513
- God!
- Do it!

245
00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:23.953
- Evan!
- You got us into this.

246
00:20:24.073 --> 00:20:25.553
Get us the fuck out!

247
00:20:28.354 --> 00:20:29.634
Do it!

248
00:20:33.394 --> 00:20:34.554
You fucking pussy!

249
00:20:46.235 --> 00:20:47.275
Shit.

250
00:21:15.518 --> 00:21:16.958
Every night.

251
00:21:18.399 --> 00:21:21.919
I keep thinking that things will get better

252
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:25.719
the next morning when I wake up.

253
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:27.199
But it isn't.

254
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.760
Everything I do,

255
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.720
everything I see, I'm surrounded by these

256
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.721
tiny triggers.

257
00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:39.481
They're everywhere,

258
00:21:40.081 --> 00:21:41.801
and they remind me of what I went through,

259
00:21:42.521 --> 00:21:44.121
what Jigsaw did to me.

260
00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:48.882
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

261
00:21:48.962 --> 00:21:51.442
You're in a safe place now.

262
00:21:51.522 --> 00:21:52.922
Tell me what happened next.

263
00:21:54.482 --> 00:21:57.683
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

264
00:22:13.004 --> 00:22:14.284
Sidney, look at me.

265
00:22:16.524 --> 00:22:18.085
You made a decision.

266
00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.485
How did that make you feel?

267
00:22:20.885 --> 00:22:21.885
Free.

268
00:22:23.845 --> 00:22:25.485
He was abusive.

269
00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:28.606
I tried to stop it before,

270
00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:31.166
but it wasn't until that moment

271
00:22:31.846 --> 00:22:33.446
that I really did something.

272
00:22:34.326 --> 00:22:37.246
It was him or me, and I chose to live.

273
00:22:37.367 --> 00:22:39.247
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

274
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:43.847
That's a bunch of bullshit.

275
00:22:44.967 --> 00:22:47.207
He had to die for you to leave him?

276
00:22:49.928 --> 00:22:52.488
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

277
00:22:52.608 --> 00:22:54.728
after having to cut off my own arm?

278
00:22:58.849 --> 00:23:02.049
It's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

279
00:23:06.369 --> 00:23:09.250
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

280
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.650
I am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

281
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.051
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

282
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:20.771
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

283
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:22.691
Yeah? Like what?

284
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:27.372
A new perspective on life. 
Wait, wait, wait.

285
00:23:29.132 --> 00:23:33.132
I know. I understand
that you're not at that place yet.

286
00:23:33.692 --> 00:23:36.292
I understand that and I respect that.

287
00:23:36.372 --> 00:23:38.193
But if you look around at all these people

288
00:23:38.413 --> 00:23:40.173
taking their lives for granted,

289
00:23:40.853 --> 00:23:45.133
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

290
00:23:45.213 --> 00:23:47.534
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

291
00:23:47.654 --> 00:23:50.254
because we are good and we are strong!

292
00:23:52.854 --> 00:23:54.174
You know what?

293
00:23:54.254 --> 00:23:57.735
I'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

294
00:23:58.495 --> 00:24:00.975
These are my scars.

295
00:24:03.535 --> 00:24:05.375
Because our minds will heal,

296
00:24:07.055 --> 00:24:08.496
but these scars will never go away.

297
00:24:09.656 --> 00:24:12.536
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

298
00:24:12.656 --> 00:24:14.456
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

299
00:24:16.856 --> 00:24:18.057
You know, earlier,

300
00:24:18.177 --> 00:24:23.017
I spoke of valuing your loved ones.

301
00:24:24.337 --> 00:24:25.697
But to be perfectly honest,

302
00:24:25.777 --> 00:24:28.618
it's something that I never did
prior to my ordeal.

303
00:24:28.698 --> 00:24:30.138
But since then,

304
00:24:30.898 --> 00:24:34.978
I have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

305
00:24:38.099 --> 00:24:39.219
Joyce, if you could...

306
00:24:40.499 --> 00:24:41.519
Please.

307
00:24:44.339 --> 00:24:46.339
It's my lovely wife Joyce.

308
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.380
- I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

309
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:02.501
Bravo.

310
00:25:03.541 --> 00:25:06.381
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

311
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:10.582
and yet find the positive
in that grizzly act,

312
00:25:11.382 --> 00:25:13.582
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

313
00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:17.943
Remarkable,

314
00:25:19.063 --> 00:25:21.143
if not a little perverse.

315
00:25:23.383 --> 00:25:26.263
I'm sure I speak for everyone
here when I say

316
00:25:26.383 --> 00:25:28.744
how grateful we are

317
00:25:29.424 --> 00:25:34.144
to be part of your promotional DVD.

318
00:25:41.465 --> 00:25:43.545
I appreciate it. Thank you. It's...

319
00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:52.666
- I can take that, sir.
- Thank you very much.

320
00:25:53.186 --> 00:25:54.486
Joyce, can I borrow him for a second?

321
00:25:54.506 --> 00:25:55.746
Sure. I'll be in the car, okay?

322
00:25:55.866 --> 00:25:56.946
Two minutes behind you.

323
00:25:57.066 --> 00:25:58.327
- Great.
- You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

324
00:25:58.347 --> 00:26:00.067
- Of course.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:01.347 --> 00:26:02.467
What's up?

326
00:26:02.587 --> 00:26:04.947
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone I should know about?

327
00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:06.987
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than I have.

328
00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.188
He's fine.

329
00:26:09.468 --> 00:26:10.468
All right.

330
00:26:11.228 --> 00:26:13.068
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

331
00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:15.068
Yeah. Everything's fine.

332
00:26:15.708 --> 00:26:16.748
Great work tonight, Bobby.

333
00:26:16.828 --> 00:26:18.469
- Thank you.
- You're the man.

334
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.470
Joyce?

335
00:26:39.271 --> 00:26:40.511
What happened to him?

336
00:26:42.311 --> 00:26:45.111
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

337
00:26:45.191 --> 00:26:47.872
- This should wrap up the week for you.
- Great.

338
00:26:53.392 --> 00:26:54.412
What's up, man?

339
00:26:55.112 --> 00:26:56.992
I'm at a junkyard on 58th.

340
00:26:57.232 --> 00:26:58.233
Why?

341
00:26:58.353 --> 00:26:59.793
Call came in about a car crash.

342
00:26:59.913 --> 00:27:01.913
Car crash? Why are you there?

343
00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:03.753
It's not just a car crash.

344
00:27:03.873 --> 00:27:05.073
It's a trap.

345
00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:06.673
How many bodies?

346
00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.834
Enough pieces to make four.

347
00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:11.894
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till I get there.

348
00:27:11.914 --> 00:27:13.634
- Even Homicide, you got it?
- Yeah.

349
00:27:13.754 --> 00:27:15.154
All right, I'm on the way.

350
00:27:17.354 --> 00:27:20.235
Hello, Evan.
I want to play a game.

351
00:27:20.675 --> 00:27:23.075
The situation you find yourself in...

352
00:27:24.675 --> 00:27:26.755
You, your girlfriend...

353
00:27:29.676 --> 00:27:34.996
You have intimidated others
based on their physical differences.

354
00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.598
So, what do you think?

355
00:27:54.278 --> 00:27:55.338
Why?

356
00:27:55.878 --> 00:27:57.439
Why this display?

357
00:27:58.439 --> 00:27:59.959
Why them? Why now?

358
00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:02.439
You know he likes to put on a show.

359
00:28:03.079 --> 00:28:05.319
Well, there's gotta be something else.

360
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.860
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

361
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.101
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

362
00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:21.041
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

363
00:28:21.161 --> 00:28:24.161
If that man has a cavity in his tooth,
I want to know about it.

364
00:28:24.281 --> 00:28:25.441
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

365
00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:26.721
Gibson.

366
00:28:27.161 --> 00:28:28.522
Yeah?

367
00:28:28.922 --> 00:28:30.482
Hoffman was expecting you.

368
00:28:33.602 --> 00:28:34.962
God damn.

369
00:28:37.923 --> 00:28:38.923
Would you look at that?

370
00:28:40.243 --> 00:28:41.643
Please get forensics in here.

371
00:28:42.123 --> 00:28:43.683
Tell them to haul ass.

372
00:28:43.963 --> 00:28:45.963
This needs to be dusted for prints.

373
00:28:46.883 --> 00:28:48.164
- All right.
- Okay.

374
00:29:21.327 --> 00:29:22.367
Help!

375
00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:41.189
Hello, Bobby.

376
00:29:42.809 --> 00:29:44.009
I want to play a game.

377
00:29:44.969 --> 00:29:48.450
You have amassed wealth, fame,
and notoriety,

378
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.210
based upon your story of survival.

379
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.930
Many have aided in your cause,
but few know the truth.

380
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.011
You are a liar.

381
00:29:58.131 --> 00:30:00.811
You and I both know
you have never been in a trap,

382
00:30:00.891 --> 00:30:03.171
nor have you ever been tested.

383
00:30:04.651 --> 00:30:08.692
Today these lies will come full circle
and you will learn

384
00:30:09.172 --> 00:30:13.532
if you truly have what it takes
to call yourself a survivor.

385
00:30:14.532 --> 00:30:16.252
The cage you find yourself in

386
00:30:16.372 --> 00:30:18.333
will symbolize your rebirth.

387
00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:22.333
Joyce? No!

388
00:30:23.893 --> 00:30:26.413
Joyce! No!

389
00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:27.814
Please, no.

390
00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:30.174
Within the next 60 minutes,

391
00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:33.174
you must stay upon the path of learning

392
00:30:33.294 --> 00:30:35.654
and traverse a series of obstacles

393
00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:37.775
to obtain access to your wife,

394
00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:39.735
who you have also deceived.

395
00:30:39.975 --> 00:30:42.775
If you fail to reach her
before the clock runs out,

396
00:30:43.255 --> 00:30:44.535
- she will die.
- No.

397
00:30:44.855 --> 00:30:46.135
Live or die, Bobby?

398
00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:47.536
Make your choice.

399
00:31:58.143 --> 00:31:59.223
Bobby!

400
00:32:00.543 --> 00:32:02.263
Help!

401
00:32:02.943 --> 00:32:04.263
Help!

402
00:32:05.663 --> 00:32:07.464
Let me out!

403
00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:18.225
Bobby.

404
00:32:18.305 --> 00:32:22.385
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

405
00:32:23.105 --> 00:32:25.625
Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.

406
00:32:26.585 --> 00:32:29.106
As the city stays crippled in fear
from the Jigsaw killings,

407
00:32:29.626 --> 00:32:32.666
chilling new words from
the latest survivor provide a reminder

408
00:32:32.786 --> 00:32:36.146
of the physical and mental toll
these deadly games can take.

409
00:32:37.186 --> 00:32:40.667
This horrible event was happening to me,

410
00:32:41.067 --> 00:32:43.827
and in that moment,

411
00:32:44.867 --> 00:32:46.907
that moment that this thing

412
00:32:47.588 --> 00:32:49.828
threatened to take everything away,

413
00:32:50.428 --> 00:32:51.908
even the pain,

414
00:32:54.108 --> 00:32:57.068
I realized what I still had left to give.

415
00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:59.989
And I didn't want to let that go.

416
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:03.549
It gave me light.

417
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:09.230
That pure moment
of absolute horror gave me light.

418
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.550
And as wrong as this may seem,

419
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.750
I'm better for enduring it.

420
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.471
I'm stronger.

421
00:33:18.151 --> 00:33:20.591
And, I must admit, I'm grateful for it.

422
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:23.711
I'm grateful it happened to me,

423
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:26.991
and I wish the same for everyone like me.

424
00:33:27.912 --> 00:33:30.112
Joan is but one of a growing
number of citizens...

425
00:33:30.272 --> 00:33:34.112
If something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

426
00:33:34.872 --> 00:33:36.432
I don't know what will.

427
00:33:37.713 --> 00:33:38.753
Yeah.

428
00:33:41.273 --> 00:33:43.593
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

429
00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:45.693
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

430
00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.760
That's a real clever design.

431
00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.080
Yours or your husband's?

432
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.880
- Everything was him.
- Right.

433
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.161
Well, here's my problem,

434
00:34:58.281 --> 00:35:01.641
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

435
00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:04.761
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

436
00:35:04.781 --> 00:35:07.561
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

437
00:35:10.242 --> 00:35:12.042
There's a new game going on.

438
00:35:12.562 --> 00:35:13.682
Does that surprise you?

439
00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:17.322
- No.
- No? No?

440
00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:20.603
You're crazy, you know that?

441
00:35:21.363 --> 00:35:23.563
I knew you were crazy
the minute I laid eyes on you.

442
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:24.723
Crazy.

443
00:35:25.883 --> 00:35:29.644
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

444
00:35:30.604 --> 00:35:33.244
Till I catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

445
00:35:34.004 --> 00:35:35.064
Get comfy.

446
00:35:35.924 --> 00:35:37.665
What makes you think he can't find me here?

447
00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:39.645
Jill, it's a safe house.

448
00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:42.125
Safe house. Safe. House.

449
00:35:42.765 --> 00:35:43.965
You get it?

450
00:35:47.085 --> 00:35:51.005
Gibson, this was sent
here addressed to Jill.

451
00:35:51.006 --> 00:35:52.286
Hoffman knows our location.

452
00:35:52.766 --> 00:35:54.686
God damn it. God damn it!

453
00:35:55.566 --> 00:35:56.586
What?

454
00:35:57.326 --> 00:35:59.927
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

455
00:36:00.047 --> 00:36:01.087
Okay, is anyone hurt?

456
00:36:01.207 --> 00:36:02.447
Holy shit!

457
00:36:10.688 --> 00:36:11.708
Rogers?

458
00:36:11.728 --> 00:36:12.968
Rogers, you okay?

459
00:36:13.048 --> 00:36:14.108
Yeah.

460
00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:16.588
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

461
00:36:16.608 --> 00:36:18.429
Don't touch anything else until it's clean.

462
00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:20.569
- Got it.
- All right.

463
00:36:22.009 --> 00:36:23.089
Play it.

464
00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:30.130
Hello, Gibson.

465
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.370
Been a long time.

466
00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.330
What I want is simple,

467
00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:35.770
give me Jill Tuck.

468
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.011
You're protecting her despite the fact

469
00:36:38.131 --> 00:36:39.811
that she had direct knowledge throughout,

470
00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:43.451
which makes her complicit in every death.

471
00:36:44.411 --> 00:36:45.931
I'll make you a deal.

472
00:36:46.011 --> 00:36:47.452
Give her to me,

473
00:36:48.652 --> 00:36:50.332
the game stops, and no one else dies.

474
00:36:51.452 --> 00:36:54.812
If not, everyone dies
and you'll be to blame.

475
00:36:55.932 --> 00:36:57.773
Make your choice.

476
00:36:57.853 --> 00:36:59.293
The clock is ticking.

477
00:37:02.173 --> 00:37:04.353
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

478
00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:06.893
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

479
00:37:06.973 --> 00:37:08.094
Got it.

480
00:37:25.935 --> 00:37:26.995
Oh, my God.

481
00:37:28.576 --> 00:37:29.596
Oh, God!

482
00:37:29.616 --> 00:37:30.856
No! Please!

483
00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:34.616
No! Please, help! Please!

484
00:37:34.856 --> 00:37:36.216
Please, no!

485
00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:37.537
God damn it!

486
00:37:38.537 --> 00:37:40.497
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

487
00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:42.457
You've got to get me out of here.

488
00:37:43.497 --> 00:37:45.257
I can't move, Bobby.

489
00:37:45.657 --> 00:37:46.817
Please, help me!

490
00:37:46.937 --> 00:37:48.698
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

491
00:37:48.778 --> 00:37:50.698
Ow.

492
00:37:52.698 --> 00:37:53.738
Ow!

493
00:37:53.978 --> 00:37:56.178
Help me! Do something!

494
00:37:58.299 --> 00:37:59.579
Don't leave me.

495
00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:02.579
Hello, Bobby.

496
00:38:02.659 --> 00:38:05.659
Before you
is one of your trusted colleagues.

497
00:38:05.779 --> 00:38:10.300
She has been your publicist for years,
knowing your lies

498
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.700
but choosing to speak no evil.

499
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.700
She has been richly rewarded for her words,

500
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.581
but today she will be rewarded
for her silence.

501
00:38:20.181 --> 00:38:22.461
In the X-ray, you will see a key,

502
00:38:22.541 --> 00:38:27.141
the key to Nina's survival,
which will shut off her device.

503
00:38:27.462 --> 00:38:28.662
But there's a catch.

504
00:38:28.742 --> 00:38:31.662
You have one minute
to pull the fish hook from her stomach,

505
00:38:31.782 --> 00:38:33.222
and unlock her device

506
00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:37.583
or else the four spikes
will penetrate her throat,

507
00:38:37.703 --> 00:38:40.223
- silencing Nina forever.
- Fuck!

508
00:38:40.343 --> 00:38:42.463
Remember, the spikes will also advance

509
00:38:42.583 --> 00:38:47.343
each time the decibel level in this room
rises above a whisper,

510
00:38:47.464 --> 00:38:49.184
killing her even sooner.

511
00:38:49.664 --> 00:38:53.224
Will Nina live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

512
00:38:55.144 --> 00:38:58.105
- Help me. Help!
- No! No!

513
00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:03.145
Just shut up.

514
00:39:04.665 --> 00:39:06.105
Stay with me, okay?

515
00:39:11.906 --> 00:39:12.946
Do it.

516
00:39:20.107 --> 00:39:22.027
No. No. No.

517
00:39:23.147 --> 00:39:25.187
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

518
00:39:25.307 --> 00:39:26.787
It's gonna be okay. Look at me.

519
00:39:26.907 --> 00:39:27.968
Look at me.

520
00:39:40.269 --> 00:39:42.629
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

521
00:39:42.709 --> 00:39:44.189
Please. Please, for me.

522
00:39:44.269 --> 00:39:45.829
Just shut the fuck up.

523
00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:47.990
I'm gonna get this out.

524
00:40:01.391 --> 00:40:02.771
No! No!

525
00:40:02.811 --> 00:40:05.811
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

526
00:40:32.294 --> 00:40:33.314
Bobby!

527
00:40:50.616 --> 00:40:51.856
No!

528
00:40:54.176 --> 00:40:56.336
Why wouldn't
you just shut the fuck up?

529
00:40:58.217 --> 00:41:00.057
You just needed to shut up!

530
00:41:03.657 --> 00:41:06.417
No! Oh, my God!

531
00:41:07.098 --> 00:41:09.778
No! Help!

532
00:41:13.498 --> 00:41:15.778
Help! Help!

533
00:41:46.822 --> 00:41:48.702
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

534
00:41:50.342 --> 00:41:51.862
Ma'am, your name?

535
00:41:51.982 --> 00:41:54.582
Sara, without an "H.' '

536
00:41:56.022 --> 00:41:58.583
I just want to say 
I love your book so much.

537
00:41:59.103 --> 00:42:01.783
I just felt like I could feel everything
that you went through.

538
00:42:02.423 --> 00:42:03.983
I feel like it changed my life.

539
00:42:04.263 --> 00:42:05.823
I appreciate that, ma'am.

540
00:42:06.984 --> 00:42:09.264
I really do. Thank you.

541
00:42:10.584 --> 00:42:12.184
Thank you.

542
00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:21.065
Your name, sir?

543
00:42:21.145 --> 00:42:22.205
John.

544
00:42:23.425 --> 00:42:26.065
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

545
00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:28.466
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

546
00:42:28.586 --> 00:42:31.066
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

547
00:42:31.946 --> 00:42:33.546
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

548
00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:36.787
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

549
00:42:36.907 --> 00:42:38.987
You don't see anything wrong with that?

550
00:42:39.387 --> 00:42:41.587
No.
No, sir, I don't.

551
00:42:45.307 --> 00:42:46.507
You know,

552
00:42:47.868 --> 00:42:49.428
history is a passion for me.

553
00:42:49.948 --> 00:42:52.588
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

554
00:42:52.668 --> 00:42:54.028
you were required to say,

555
00:42:54.108 --> 00:42:58.829
"If I'm lying, take me to the quarries.' '

556
00:43:01.149 --> 00:43:02.989
That mean anything to you?

557
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:05.389
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

558
00:43:05.949 --> 00:43:07.750
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

559
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:11.230
It means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

560
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:14.550
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

561
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.350
What are you implying here, sir?

562
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.951
I'm not implying anything.

563
00:43:18.551 --> 00:43:20.631
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

564
00:43:22.351 --> 00:43:23.991
Thanks for the signature.

565
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:27.312
Nice picture, but I don't need it.

566
00:43:28.352 --> 00:43:29.592
We've met.

567
00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:44.393
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

568
00:43:44.513 --> 00:43:45.593
They're from the junkyard.

569
00:43:50.754 --> 00:43:52.514
Make your choice.

570
00:43:52.994 --> 00:43:54.354
The clock is ticking.

571
00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:56.074
See that?

572
00:43:57.275 --> 00:43:58.295
Yeah.

573
00:43:59.435 --> 00:44:01.115
I know that from somewhere.

574
00:44:02.075 --> 00:44:04.635
Hey, I've got
something over here.

575
00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:09.116
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

576
00:44:09.196 --> 00:44:12.036
It was taken
from a security camera downtown.

577
00:44:12.156 --> 00:44:13.756
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

578
00:44:13.836 --> 00:44:14.916
- Familiar?
- No.

579
00:44:15.036 --> 00:44:18.237
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

580
00:44:18.677 --> 00:44:21.157
His wife and handlers are also missing.

581
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.720
Joyce?

582
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.800
Who is it? Who's there?

583
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.760
- Suzanne.
- Who is that?

584
00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.641
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

585
00:44:57.201 --> 00:44:58.401
Bobby, get me out of here.

586
00:44:58.481 --> 00:44:59.681
Bobby, help me.

587
00:44:59.761 --> 00:45:01.721
- Is Cale here?
- Who the fuck knows?

588
00:45:01.841 --> 00:45:04.801
Get this off of me, Bobby!
Get this off of me!

589
00:45:10.202 --> 00:45:11.202
Hello, Bobby.

590
00:45:11.322 --> 00:45:15.162
That feeling running
through your body is fear,

591
00:45:15.282 --> 00:45:19.083
the fear of not knowing
if you have what it takes to survive.

592
00:45:19.203 --> 00:45:20.963
Before you is your lawyer

593
00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:22.523
who swore an oath of ethics,

594
00:45:22.643 --> 00:45:27.364
but chose to see no evil
in order to benefit herself.

595
00:45:27.484 --> 00:45:29.404
Once her device begins to rotate,

596
00:45:29.524 --> 00:45:31.724
it will pierce her eyes and mouth

597
00:45:31.844 --> 00:45:35.524
if you don't delay its movement
for at least 30 seconds.

598
00:45:35.644 --> 00:45:36.705
To do this,

599
00:45:36.725 --> 00:45:41.445
you must step into the other machine
and lift the bars to the highest position

600
00:45:41.565 --> 00:45:45.925
long enough to close the circuit,
slowing down her device.

601
00:45:46.045 --> 00:45:48.966
If you do nothing,
she will wind to her death

602
00:45:49.086 --> 00:45:50.486
before the clock runs out.

603
00:45:50.886 --> 00:45:53.006
Do you have what it takes to help her?

604
00:45:53.366 --> 00:45:54.366
Make your choice.

605
00:45:54.966 --> 00:45:56.166
Bobby, please!

606
00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:57.967
Bobby, please get me out!

607
00:45:58.327 --> 00:45:59.367
Get me the fuck...

608
00:46:00.887 --> 00:46:01.947
Oh, God!

609
00:46:03.207 --> 00:46:05.127
No, no! Bobby, please!

610
00:46:06.688 --> 00:46:07.968
Please, help me!

611
00:46:09.968 --> 00:46:12.328
Oh, God! Oh, God!

612
00:46:12.448 --> 00:46:14.488
Please, hurry! Hurry!

613
00:46:15.048 --> 00:46:18.129
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

614
00:46:18.249 --> 00:46:20.289
Come on! Bobby, come on!

615
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:24.009
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

616
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.850
Bobby, please, hurry!

617
00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:33.030
Hurry!

618
00:46:38.331 --> 00:46:41.211
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

619
00:46:42.771 --> 00:46:43.931
Come on!

620
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:46.211
Bobby, no.

621
00:46:53.772 --> 00:46:56.853
No! God, no!

622
00:46:56.973 --> 00:46:58.693
No! Bobby!

623
00:46:58.773 --> 00:47:01.533
Please, no! Bobby, no!

624
00:47:02.253 --> 00:47:04.813
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

625
00:47:05.293 --> 00:47:06.353
Come on!

626
00:47:07.574 --> 00:47:08.854
Bobby, please!

627
00:47:09.054 --> 00:47:10.074
No!

628
00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:11.354
Oh, God.

629
00:47:11.574 --> 00:47:13.854
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

630
00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:20.055
Bobby, please, no!

631
00:47:20.375 --> 00:47:21.935
No! No!

632
00:47:26.575 --> 00:47:27.596
No!

633
00:47:30.696 --> 00:47:32.336
Please, please!

634
00:47:32.696 --> 00:47:33.716
No!

635
00:47:35.977 --> 00:47:37.178
Oh, God!

636
00:48:20.302 --> 00:48:21.782
Oh, my God.

637
00:48:24.342 --> 00:48:26.142
No. No.

638
00:48:27.303 --> 00:48:28.343
Help!

639
00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.584
Do you know this guy?

640
00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.265
I've seen him on TV, but I don't know him.

641
00:48:51.425 --> 00:48:52.445
Did your husband?

642
00:48:52.665 --> 00:48:53.825
I don't know.

643
00:48:55.545 --> 00:48:57.506
You sure you don't know him?

644
00:48:59.586 --> 00:49:00.746
Yeah, I'm sure.

645
00:49:01.746 --> 00:49:03.026
All right then.

646
00:49:06.787 --> 00:49:08.067
Lock it up.

647
00:49:08.827 --> 00:49:11.627
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

648
00:49:11.747 --> 00:49:13.907
I'm just searching the IP address.

649
00:49:14.027 --> 00:49:15.467
Can you find out where it came from?

650
00:49:15.587 --> 00:49:19.108
It depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

651
00:49:19.188 --> 00:49:21.668
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

652
00:49:21.788 --> 00:49:22.848
Play it.

653
00:49:24.268 --> 00:49:25.468
Hello, Gibson.

654
00:49:25.868 --> 00:49:28.389
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.

655
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:31.549
I don't blame you
for not giving me Jill Tuck,

656
00:49:31.949 --> 00:49:34.369
but you shouldn't let an old grudge
cloud your judgment.

657
00:49:35.669 --> 00:49:37.390
Look to where you're being led.

658
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.950
Look beyond the crossroad
to the clear dawn.

659
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.150
Do you see it?

660
00:49:47.031 --> 00:49:48.591
I get it. Let's go.

661
00:50:06.373 --> 00:50:07.393
Joyce?

662
00:50:25.414 --> 00:50:26.435
Cale?

663
00:50:26.515 --> 00:50:27.875
Bobby? Bobby?

664
00:50:28.175 --> 00:50:30.495
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, I can see you, okay?

665
00:50:30.855 --> 00:50:32.975
- Cale, don't move.
- Bobby, where the hell are you?

666
00:50:33.055 --> 00:50:35.395
- You got to help me, Bobby.
- Do you know where Joyce is?

667
00:50:35.415 --> 00:50:36.776
What the fuck? I can't see, man.

668
00:50:36.856 --> 00:50:38.576
How the fuck would I know where Joyce is?

669
00:50:38.596 --> 00:50:39.676
I'm about to lose my shit!

670
00:50:39.756 --> 00:50:41.716
Do I know where Joyce is?
I'm fucking blind, man.

671
00:50:41.736 --> 00:50:43.656
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

672
00:50:43.736 --> 00:50:45.756
I got this thing around my fucking neck.
I can't fucking breathe.

673
00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.797
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

674
00:50:47.817 --> 00:50:49.077
A lot of this floor is missing.

675
00:50:49.097 --> 00:50:50.937
Just don't move, okay?

676
00:50:51.097 --> 00:50:52.737
Fuck. You gotta help me.

677
00:50:53.457 --> 00:50:56.878
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

678
00:50:57.098 --> 00:50:58.258
Cale, there's a tape.

679
00:50:58.378 --> 00:51:00.818
- What fucking tape?
- There's a tape.

680
00:51:00.938 --> 00:51:02.418
Shut up. I'm gonna play the tape.

681
00:51:05.978 --> 00:51:10.339
Hello, Bobby.
Across from you is your closest friend.

682
00:51:10.459 --> 00:51:15.899
He knows all your sins,
yet he acts as though he hears no evil.

683
00:51:15.979 --> 00:51:18.020
Today, what he hears

684
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.380
will be the difference
between life and death.

685
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:24.580
Bobby, you must help
Cale walk over the planks,

686
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.781
and get as close to you as possible.

687
00:51:27.341 --> 00:51:30.581
Find your own way across
the beams to the key.

688
00:51:31.181 --> 00:51:34.661
You must get it to him over
the last span between you.

689
00:51:34.741 --> 00:51:39.102
If the noose around Cale's neck
is not removed within 60 seconds,

690
00:51:39.222 --> 00:51:43.462
a winch will be engaged,
and your secret will be left hanging.

691
00:51:43.782 --> 00:51:47.303
Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

692
00:51:47.423 --> 00:51:48.623
Bobby!

693
00:51:48.743 --> 00:51:49.803
Oh, God.

694
00:51:50.223 --> 00:51:52.623
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

695
00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:53.983
Listen to me.

696
00:51:54.063 --> 00:51:56.063
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

697
00:51:56.524 --> 00:51:58.884
Listen, I'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

698
00:51:58.964 --> 00:52:00.444
I'm blind. You fucking come to me.

699
00:52:00.524 --> 00:52:02.644
I'm gonna try to get as close to you
as I can, buddy.

700
00:52:02.664 --> 00:52:05.004
I'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

701
00:52:05.084 --> 00:52:07.225
I want you to shuffle to your right.

702
00:52:07.225 --> 00:52:09.105
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

703
00:52:09.905 --> 00:52:12.145
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

704
00:52:12.265 --> 00:52:15.065
Yes, yes, perfect.
I need you to head out on that plank.

705
00:52:15.185 --> 00:52:16.245
- Oh, fuck.
- Yes.

706
00:52:17.346 --> 00:52:19.066
Okay, I got it. I got it. I got it!

707
00:52:21.146 --> 00:52:22.506
Fuck this.

708
00:52:22.866 --> 00:52:24.426
Okay, Cale, I'm on the way.

709
00:52:25.066 --> 00:52:27.187
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

710
00:52:27.427 --> 00:52:29.387
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

711
00:52:29.707 --> 00:52:31.067
- Okay.
- You're gonna have to go

712
00:52:31.187 --> 00:52:32.587
about 10 degrees to your right.

713
00:52:32.747 --> 00:52:34.107
I got it. I got it.

714
00:52:34.227 --> 00:52:36.688
- Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
- Okay. Okay, Cale.

715
00:52:37.148 --> 00:52:38.908
- Feel where the plank...
- I got it.

716
00:52:39.468 --> 00:52:40.488
Okay.

717
00:52:40.908 --> 00:52:43.348
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

718
00:52:43.468 --> 00:52:45.868
It's okay, Cale. It was a bottle.
It was a bottle.

719
00:52:45.988 --> 00:52:48.549
- What the fuck was that?
- It's okay. It was a bottle.

720
00:52:48.629 --> 00:52:51.029
- You're gonna be fine.
- Okay.

721
00:52:51.629 --> 00:52:53.549
Fuck. Okay.

722
00:52:53.669 --> 00:52:54.789
You got it, buddy.

723
00:52:55.229 --> 00:52:57.870
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

724
00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.910
- You'll feel it with your foot.
- I got it.

725
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:02.210
Feel it with your foot.

726
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.871
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

727
00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:08.291
Step up onto the plank.

728
00:53:11.031 --> 00:53:12.311
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

729
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:14.351
Relax. You're okay.

730
00:53:17.912 --> 00:53:19.512
No! No!

731
00:53:20.192 --> 00:53:21.592
Cale, hang on. Cale.

732
00:53:24.872 --> 00:53:26.072
Fuck. Fuck.

733
00:53:29.833 --> 00:53:31.793
Fuck. Fuck.

734
00:53:45.154 --> 00:53:46.355
Bobby. Bobby.

735
00:53:57.676 --> 00:53:59.236
I got the key but... Cale!

736
00:54:00.396 --> 00:54:01.516
I'm gonna throw you the key.

737
00:54:01.536 --> 00:54:03.576
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

738
00:54:03.596 --> 00:54:05.476
I'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

739
00:54:07.957 --> 00:54:09.317
One,

740
00:54:09.677 --> 00:54:11.037
two,

741
00:54:11.157 --> 00:54:12.177
three.

742
00:54:18.358 --> 00:54:19.378
No.

743
00:54:21.798 --> 00:54:23.158
Oh, fuck me.

744
00:54:27.559 --> 00:54:29.439
No! God damn it, no!

745
00:54:32.159 --> 00:54:33.239
Cale!

746
00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.640
No. Cale.

747
00:54:55.521 --> 00:54:56.562
There's nothing here.

748
00:54:56.682 --> 00:54:58.042
Yes, there is.

749
00:54:58.802 --> 00:55:00.122
Right there.

750
00:55:05.322 --> 00:55:06.963
Why would he want us to come here?

751
00:55:07.043 --> 00:55:09.123
For me to remember.

752
00:55:09.243 --> 00:55:11.563
This is where he saved my life.

753
00:55:12.803 --> 00:55:16.243
When I was in uniform
I responded to a distress call here.

754
00:55:16.764 --> 00:55:20.444
Back when this place was a flophouse
for junkies and homeless people.

755
00:55:37.686 --> 00:55:39.806
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

756
00:55:41.846 --> 00:55:43.206
Drop the gun.

757
00:55:52.727 --> 00:55:53.887
He didn't know what hit him.

758
00:55:54.967 --> 00:55:59.648
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

759
00:56:06.409 --> 00:56:08.689
Next time, you shoot first.

760
00:56:11.289 --> 00:56:14.049
I had no choice
but to report Hoffman for brutality.

761
00:56:14.169 --> 00:56:15.249
You owe me.

762
00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.030
What happened?

763
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:27.411
He got a promotion is what happened.
And I got put on an island.

764
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:30.851
A year later, I transferred to IA,
busted three of his guys.

765
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:34.411
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

766
00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:39.372
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

767
00:56:41.212 --> 00:56:43.292
"Look beyond the crossroads

768
00:56:45.092 --> 00:56:46.693
"to the clear dawn.' '

769
00:56:47.453 --> 00:56:48.893
I don't follow you.

770
00:56:48.973 --> 00:56:52.453
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

771
00:56:52.573 --> 00:56:54.293
when the state shut it down.

772
00:56:54.573 --> 00:56:56.273
That building's been abandoned for years.

773
00:56:57.254 --> 00:56:59.014
That's where the game is being played.

774
00:56:59.094 --> 00:57:01.734
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

775
00:57:01.814 --> 00:57:03.974
Don't let her out of your sight.

776
00:57:21.736 --> 00:57:22.796
Bobby!

777
00:57:24.816 --> 00:57:27.137
- Joyce?
- Bobby. Bobby!

778
00:57:28.177 --> 00:57:29.577
Bobby, I'm here.

779
00:57:30.497 --> 00:57:32.337
- Joyce.
- Bobby, can you hear me?

780
00:57:32.457 --> 00:57:34.177
Joyce, I can hear you. I can see you.

781
00:57:34.257 --> 00:57:35.817
Bobby, I can see you, too.

782
00:57:36.538 --> 00:57:38.018
Yes, baby.

783
00:57:38.658 --> 00:57:41.098
- Get me out of here.
- Baby, I'm on my way.

784
00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.338
Who's doing this? Why?

785
00:57:43.418 --> 00:57:45.978
- Why is this happening?
- Please, baby, I'm on the way.

786
00:57:46.699 --> 00:57:49.339
- Just hang on, okay?
- Hurry. Please hurry.

787
00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:52.019
There's got to be a tape.

788
00:57:53.059 --> 00:57:54.079
Hello, Bobby.

789
00:57:54.979 --> 00:57:57.700
Before you is the door
that leads to your wife.

790
00:57:57.780 --> 00:58:00.980
However, you must first make a choice.

791
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:05.420
As you may have guessed, your decision
will be as difficult as pulling teeth.

792
00:58:07.021 --> 00:58:11.181
The lock before you requires
a four-digit combination to open.

793
00:58:11.301 --> 00:58:14.181
However, if it is access you seek

794
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:17.662
then a true sacrifice will have to be made.

795
00:58:19.222 --> 00:58:20.822
Watch and learn, Bobby.

796
00:58:25.102 --> 00:58:29.263
The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth.

797
00:58:30.983 --> 00:58:34.303
Look to the chart as a reference
for which teeth to pull

798
00:58:34.423 --> 00:58:37.184
and in which order to enter the digits.

799
00:58:38.664 --> 00:58:40.424
Time is ticking down.

800
00:58:40.824 --> 00:58:42.344
You must make your decision quickly.

801
00:58:47.185 --> 00:58:48.265
Bobby!

802
00:58:49.465 --> 00:58:52.425
I don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

803
00:58:52.545 --> 00:58:53.865
Oh, my God.

804
00:58:56.626 --> 00:58:57.826
No.

805
00:59:00.226 --> 00:59:01.286
No!

806
00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:03.706
Left side clear.

807
00:59:04.986 --> 00:59:06.006
Clear.

808
00:59:07.427 --> 00:59:08.447
- Clear.
- Clear.

809
00:59:08.947 --> 00:59:09.967
Change your position.

810
00:59:11.747 --> 00:59:13.067
The game's still on.

811
00:59:23.028 --> 00:59:24.828
- Let's go.
- Move to the second level.

812
00:59:32.229 --> 00:59:33.469
- Clear.
- Clear.

813
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:35.829
Clear.

814
00:59:35.909 --> 00:59:36.970
Go.

815
00:59:52.231 --> 00:59:54.151
- Clear up.
- All clear.

816
00:59:54.431 --> 00:59:55.471
Move, move.

817
00:59:57.792 --> 00:59:59.392
- Moving in.
- Moving in.

818
00:59:59.712 --> 01:00:01.392
- Clear.
- We're clear.

819
01:00:08.993 --> 01:00:10.553
Block it off.

820
01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.693
- What?
- I found where that MPEG came from.

821
01:00:13.813 --> 01:00:15.893
- Where?
- A business called Pete's Auto Body

822
01:00:15.973 --> 01:00:17.174
on 58th Street.

823
01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:19.694
- The junkyard.
- The location of the car trap?

824
01:00:19.814 --> 01:00:21.174
Yeah, that's correct.

825
01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:25.014
Okay,
you guys keep moving.

826
01:00:25.134 --> 01:00:26.415
Where are you going?

827
01:00:26.935 --> 01:00:27.955
To get Hoffman.

828
01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:29.835
Okay, let's move it.

829
01:00:36.255 --> 01:00:37.376
Rogers.

830
01:00:41.896 --> 01:00:42.896
Yeah.

831
01:00:43.576 --> 01:00:45.896
What? What happened?

832
01:00:47.097 --> 01:00:48.737
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

833
01:00:50.577 --> 01:00:52.017
The game isn't over.

834
01:01:05.698 --> 01:01:07.099
Another body.

835
01:01:09.739 --> 01:01:10.739
Hold.

836
01:01:14.659 --> 01:01:15.739
We got a live one.

837
01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:34.141
Can't cross here. Let's go.

838
01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:20.306
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

839
01:02:37.548 --> 01:02:38.608
Give me your gun.

840
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.790
Hoffman, freeze.

841
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:04.310
I want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

842
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:13.951
Joyce.

843
01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:15.051
Bobby.

844
01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:17.592
Bobby, I knew you'd make it.

845
01:03:19.192 --> 01:03:20.232
I knew you'd find me.

846
01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:21.512
I am so sorry.

847
01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.112
I knew you could do it.

848
01:03:23.832 --> 01:03:25.072
I knew you'd come.

849
01:03:25.392 --> 01:03:26.413
Get me out.

850
01:03:30.313 --> 01:03:31.473
Bobby. Oh, my God.

851
01:03:32.633 --> 01:03:33.973
There's gotta be another way.

852
01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:41.554
Hello, Bobby.
You have almost completed your rebirth.

853
01:03:41.674 --> 01:03:45.834
However, your final task
will be your most difficult.

854
01:03:45.954 --> 01:03:49.195
The woman before you
symbolizes your success.

855
01:03:49.315 --> 01:03:50.675
She is your trophy.

856
01:03:50.795 --> 01:03:53.355
And she has seen the good
in your message,

857
01:03:53.435 --> 01:03:55.475
despite its dishonest beginnings.

858
01:03:55.595 --> 01:03:56.916
What's he talking about?

859
01:03:57.036 --> 01:04:00.956
Today, we will see
if you can truly earn her love.

860
01:04:02.636 --> 01:04:04.956
To prove your status as a survivor,

861
01:04:05.036 --> 01:04:09.197
you must overcome a game
that should be all too familiar.

862
01:04:10.277 --> 01:04:12.637
- No.
- You supposedly survived it once already,

863
01:04:12.717 --> 01:04:16.478
so it should be easy to survive once again.

864
01:04:17.198 --> 01:04:19.558
Pierce the hooks
through your chest muscles,

865
01:04:19.638 --> 01:04:21.078
and the game will begin.

866
01:04:21.198 --> 01:04:25.958
In order to free yourself and your wife,
you must hoist yourself with these chains,

867
01:04:26.799 --> 01:04:31.719
and connect the extension cords above you
before the clock expires.

868
01:04:34.799 --> 01:04:37.600
Both hands will be needed
to complete this task.

869
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.480
But that should be simple.

870
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.240
For, as you claim to understand,

871
01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:45.760
the pectoral muscles
can easily support your weight.

872
01:04:46.321 --> 01:04:47.521
So I ask you, Bobby,

873
01:04:47.601 --> 01:04:50.721
when you embrace every day
as if it is your last,

874
01:04:51.281 --> 01:04:53.201
will it be with your wife?

875
01:04:54.201 --> 01:04:55.721
Make your choice.

876
01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:58.562
What's he talking about?

877
01:04:59.122 --> 01:05:00.322
Baby, I'm so sorry.

878
01:05:02.802 --> 01:05:03.822
I lied.

879
01:05:05.962 --> 01:05:07.563
I was never in a trap.

880
01:05:13.523 --> 01:05:14.603
Clear.

881
01:05:38.006 --> 01:05:39.926
How could you let me believe that?

882
01:05:40.446 --> 01:05:42.166
I'm gonna make this right.

883
01:05:42.926 --> 01:05:45.006
You don't deserve to be there.

884
01:05:47.647 --> 01:05:49.007
I'm your wife.

885
01:05:49.687 --> 01:05:51.447
How could you lie to me?

886
01:06:00.568 --> 01:06:01.768
I know that from somewhere.

887
01:06:03.088 --> 01:06:05.088
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

888
01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:18.130
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

889
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.250
What is this, sir?

890
01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:24.890
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

891
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:26.691
He's been watching us the whole time.

892
01:06:55.093 --> 01:06:56.614
Oh, my God.

893
01:07:02.854 --> 01:07:03.974
- This is Palmer.
- Listen.

894
01:07:04.094 --> 01:07:06.154
You get every available officer
back to the station.

895
01:07:06.174 --> 01:07:07.195
I'm sorry, sir?

896
01:07:07.275 --> 01:07:08.555
Right now.

897
01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:10.835
Sir.

898
01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:30.097
Gibson, are you
still there? Gibson.

899
01:08:20.862 --> 01:08:22.302
- Door's locked!
- We're locked in!

900
01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:26.723
Gas! Gas!

901
01:08:27.063 --> 01:08:28.123
Look for an exit.

902
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:50.025
I love you, Joyce.

903
01:08:52.025 --> 01:08:53.745
I never lied about that.

904
01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:56.585
I love you. I love you.

905
01:08:56.586 --> 01:08:58.386
Bobby, I love you.

906
01:09:03.426 --> 01:09:05.106
No! Oh, my God.

907
01:09:07.107 --> 01:09:08.187
No.

908
01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.307
No.

909
01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:21.068
Gibson.

910
01:09:34.109 --> 01:09:35.909
You can do it.
You can do it.

911
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:42.050
Oh, my God.

912
01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:49.511
Bobby, I love you.

913
01:10:05.112 --> 01:10:06.353
You can do it.

914
01:10:10.033 --> 01:10:12.153
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

915
01:10:13.553 --> 01:10:15.833
Pull. Pull, Bobby. I know you can do it.

916
01:10:16.474 --> 01:10:17.514
Pull.

917
01:10:19.194 --> 01:10:20.914
Oh, my God. Keep going.

918
01:10:21.034 --> 01:10:23.794
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

919
01:10:23.874 --> 01:10:24.954
Bobby!

920
01:10:26.074 --> 01:10:27.155
Pull!

921
01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:51.577
What was that?

922
01:10:51.837 --> 01:10:54.037
That's it, pull. Pull!

923
01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:57.038
Pull.

924
01:10:59.398 --> 01:11:00.478
Hurry!

925
01:11:02.758 --> 01:11:03.858
Pull. You're almost there.

926
01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:09.799
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

927
01:11:11.639 --> 01:11:12.719
Someone's out there.

928
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.200
Oh, my God. No!

929
01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.600
Help me! Help me!

930
01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:28.081
Help me! No!

931
01:11:37.162 --> 01:11:38.282
I've been looking for you.

932
01:12:00.124 --> 01:12:01.184
How do I look?

933
01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:09.645
Bitch.

934
01:12:11.965 --> 01:12:13.445
Help me!

935
01:12:17.006 --> 01:12:18.526
Bobby, please, reach.

936
01:12:20.046 --> 01:12:21.066
Go.

937
01:12:22.246 --> 01:12:23.526
Bobby, reach.

938
01:12:24.766 --> 01:12:25.786
Hurry.

939
01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:27.767
Reach. Reach!

940
01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:29.287
You can do it, Bobby.

941
01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.768
Bobby, reach. Reach.

942
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:48.489
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

943
01:12:48.609 --> 01:12:50.009
Bobby, you can do it.

944
01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.230
Bobby!

945
01:14:00.016 --> 01:14:01.076
No!

946
01:14:03.136 --> 01:14:04.336
Bobby!

947
01:14:08.617 --> 01:14:10.537
No. Bobby!

948
01:14:12.137 --> 01:14:13.217
Joyce!

949
01:14:16.658 --> 01:14:17.738
Bobby!

950
01:14:19.138 --> 01:14:20.198
Joyce!

951
01:14:20.278 --> 01:14:21.638
Bobby! Bobby!

952
01:14:25.938 --> 01:14:28.379
Joyce! Joyce!

953
01:14:31.659 --> 01:14:32.739
Bobby!

954
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:48.581
You fucking cunt.

955
01:14:54.501 --> 01:14:55.901
No! Bobby!

956
01:15:02.542 --> 01:15:03.602
Joyce!

957
01:15:05.622 --> 01:15:06.683
No!

958
01:15:18.144 --> 01:15:19.224
Bobby!

959
01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:31.105
Joyce!

960
01:16:51.393 --> 01:16:52.633
Game over.

961
01:17:09.755 --> 01:17:11.035
Over the last two hours,

962
01:17:11.115 --> 01:17:14.155
it seems our entire city
has been shaken to its core.

963
01:17:14.235 --> 01:17:16.916
In addition to the nine police
employees killed tonight,

964
01:17:16.996 --> 01:17:20.356
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.

965
01:17:20.756 --> 01:17:23.676
Citizens are being
advised to report any activity,

966
01:17:23.796 --> 01:17:26.076
even remotely suspicious, at this time,

967
01:17:26.156 --> 01:17:28.797
as blockades are being set up
at major intersections

968
01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:30.397
within a 30-mile radius,

969
01:17:30.517 --> 01:17:33.637
surrounding what will be considered
the largest attack

970
01:17:33.757 --> 01:17:36.357
on this city's police department
in our history.

971
01:17:36.878 --> 01:17:40.398
Any citizens with information
leading to the apprehension...

972
01:18:12.641 --> 01:18:14.041
What the fuck?

973
01:18:31.363 --> 01:18:33.083
Hello, Dr. Gordon.

974
01:18:34.363 --> 01:18:36.804
You are perhaps my greatest asset.

975
01:18:50.485 --> 01:18:53.765
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon.
You survived.

976
01:19:07.287 --> 01:19:13.247
Without you, my work over the last
few years would not have been possible.

977
01:19:21.288 --> 01:19:22.448
Jeff's wife.

978
01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:24.448
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

979
01:19:28.969 --> 01:19:30.009
She'll be perfect.

980
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:38.570
My eyes! I can't see!

981
01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:56.251
That having been said,
I have a request.

982
01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:57.732
Watch over Jill.

983
01:19:59.132 --> 01:20:04.412
And should anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediately on my behalf.

984
01:20:04.972 --> 01:20:09.453
In return for that,
I will keep no more secrets from you.

985
01:20:11.853 --> 01:20:13.693
I've shown you a lot of places.

986
01:20:15.813 --> 01:20:19.614
But there is one that will be, perhaps,
the most meaningful to you.

987
01:20:58.418 --> 01:20:59.538
I don't think so.

988
01:21:10.819 --> 01:21:12.059
What do you think you're doing?

989
01:21:14.099 --> 01:21:16.059
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

990
01:21:26.020 --> 01:21:27.081
No!

991
01:21:28.261 --> 01:21:29.621
You can't fucking do this to me.

992
01:21:30.501 --> 01:21:32.381
Fuck you. No!

993
01:21:32.501 --> 01:21:33.501
Game over.

994
01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:34.741
No!
