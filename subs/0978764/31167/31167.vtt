1
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,532
For your safety and security,

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:12,925
and per our regulations,
we ask that you do not

3
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,406
leave your luggage
unattended at any time.

4
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,541
Do you like Munchers?

5
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,021
My daughter does.

6
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:23,240
I got a free one. Help me out.

7
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:24,502
Sure, thanks.

8
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:25,851
Have a good flight.

9
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:27,505
Hey.

10
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:30,813
Hey.

11
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,858
Um, so...

12
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:37,907
Excuse me.

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,561
Are you sure
you want to interrupt?

14
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,476
She looks like
she can handle herself.

15
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,392
Fake laugh. She's trying
to get rid of him.

16
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:46,481
No, no, no, it's fake
'cause she likes him.

17
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,223
You may know women,
but I know my daughter.

18
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,615
The pre-boarding announcement

19
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,095
for Cartier Air Flight 617...

20
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,814
We're now inviting those
passengers requiring...

21
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,231
Munchers?

22
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,276
I hate Munchers.

23
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:03,846
I found a way to upgrade your
seat so we can sit together.

24
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,675
Do you want me
to do that? I'm fine in economy.

25
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:08,392
I routed my trip
through Chicago specifically

26
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,373
to accompany you to Vancouver.

27
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,202
Dad, I will be 25 feet away.

28
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,247
Don't worry.

29
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,466
I'll come and check on you.

30
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,512
Okay.

31
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,998
She won't even sit with me.

32
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,611
Why didn't you just
sit her with us to begin with?

33
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,221
Her mother booked her tickets,

34
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,702
but then she got pulled to
Hong Kong at the last minute

35
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,660
since our conference
is in Vancouver.

36
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:37,445
Anyway, I figured...

37
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,231
We don't let Evie
travel alone anymore.

38
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,451
Why?

39
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:46,671
Last time she flew alone,
she was kidnapped.

40
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,588
My God. Yeah.

41
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,199
This is the boarding
announcement for.

42
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,810
Cartier Air Flight 617
to Vancouver. That's us.

43
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:58,292
We're inviting all passengers
to begin boarding at this time.

44
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:02,818
Welcome to Cartier Flight 617.Thanks.

45
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,037
Here we are.
Welcome to Cartier...

46
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,561
Do you need help
finding your seat?

47
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,737
Yeah, yes. Right down this aisle.

48
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,001
So you're telling me
that she actually said yes?

49
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:13,263
What?

50
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,830
You're so full of crap.

51
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,851
And she's gonna be in Vancouver
the whole time we're there.

52
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,007
Dude, that's crazy.

53
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,182
Gentlemen.

54
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,184
Not the time, not the place.

55
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:23,317
Excuse me.

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,883
Sure.

57
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,019
So what happened?
Who kidnapped Evie?

58
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:32,630
It's a story for another day.

59
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:34,415
Munchers?

60
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,329
No, thanks.

61
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,200
Okay.

62
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,332
Ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,594
this is the captain speaking.

64
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,378
We'll be departing
in a few moments.

65
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,206
Weather report
shows sunny skies...

66
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,294
Hey.

67
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,991
It's Evie, right?

68
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,124
Looks like
we're sitting together.

69
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,083
This isn't 14F.

70
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,389
Okay, yeah.

71
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:54,826
You caught me.
Switched seats with my teammate.

72
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,524
Well, your transparency
is astounding.

73
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,047
A-And charming?

74
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,136
Little bit.

75
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,836
Tighten your seatbelt.

76
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,751
Bad things happen when I travel.

77
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,164
Flight attendants
prepare for takeoff.

78
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,406
Okay.

79
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,674
Sir, coffee? Something to drink?

80
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,807
Last night, we won,
so we snuck up onto the roof,

81
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,287
and, you know, we were partying,

82
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,464
and, as a joke, um,
some of the guys

83
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,640
locked the three of us
onto the roof all night.

84
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,251
You know,
so we'd missed breakfast,

85
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,360
we missed the bus,
and then we ended up... Having fun, Bower?

86
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,516
No, sir.

87
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:38,174
He okay?

88
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,176
He's a hard-ass.

89
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,787
But he knows how to coach.

90
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,267
I'm just glad

91
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,964
she's spending
more time in Chicago now.

92
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:49,968
She was away from her
grandfather for too long.

93
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,361
Away from me, too.

94
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,580
Why?

95
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,584
Bruno?

96
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:00,588
Bruno, open the door. Come on.

97
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,763
What's going on?

98
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,286
I know you can hear me.
Open the door.

99
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,853
The captain's locked out.

100
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,903
Everything all right?

101
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:15,603
Yes, sir, everything's fine.
Please, return to your seat.

102
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:18,649
Captain.

103
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,782
Just returning
from the washroom.

104
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,697
Copilot's not responding. You try the code?

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,220
He overrode it.

106
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,875
Listen, I'm a
professional negotiator.

107
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,180
Maybe I can help.

108
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,270
Well, you can help
by returning to your seat.

109
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,490
Sir, the captain is busy.

110
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,251
Please take your seat. I
thought cockpit doors

111
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,277
were impossible to open
from the outside.

112
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,236
We have a code in case the pilot
suffers a medical emergency.

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,369
Must just be a
technical issue. All right.

114
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,591
What is going on?

115
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,028
Copilot.

116
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:52,335
I think he just
hijacked the plane.

117
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,628
We need the captain on our side.

118
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:28,066
I agree, but he's definitely
the take charge type.

119
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,590
Maybe he'll listen to a woman.

120
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,505
They rarely do.

121
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:34,072
Right.

122
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,646
That's normal, right?

123
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,691
Captain, I'm sorry.

124
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,867
What-what's going on?

125
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,695
Just some turbulence up ahead.

126
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:50,306
The copilot's diverting,
that's all.

127
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,656
Perhaps the passengers
should be reassured.

128
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,702
Yeah.

129
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,578
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Tremblay.

130
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,382
Due to some turbulence up ahead,
we are making

131
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,929
a slight course correction.

132
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,061
Please, just enjoy

133
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:09,325
the rest of the flight.

134
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,327
Okay, Captain,
what's really going on?

135
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
Or do you always stand
outside the cockpit door

136
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,461
when there's turbulence?

137
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,897
As Eric said,

138
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,247
we're negotiators.
What have you got to lose?

139
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:24,471
The copilot's flying us south.

140
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,037
Is he talking? Made any demands?

141
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,908
No.

142
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,972
Nothing but silence so far.

143
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:29,519
But as long as the Wi-Fi is up,

144
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,956
I can make calls, so I'm
gonna contact flight center

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,958
to find out if they have
any idea why my copilot

146
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,482
isn't responding.

147
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,310
Look, his name is Bruno Lessio.

148
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:44,621
Why would a copilot
divert his own plane? Terrorism?

149
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,449
Or a suicide.

150
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,756
Why not just crash the plane?

151
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,603
Well, jumpers often stand
on a ledge for hours.

152
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,587
I mean, the fact that he's not
sure is to our advantage.

153
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,416
Call Zara. I'm gonna talk to Bruno.
Okay.

154
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,817
It's Cynthia.

155
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,558
Hey.

156
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,082
Hey, Zara.
We have a situation here.

157
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:15,957
Bruno, my name's Eric Beaumont.
I'm a professional negotiator.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
Now, the first rule
of negotiation

159
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:19,221
is to find out
what the person needs,

160
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:21,484
and then find a way
to give it to them, so...

161
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,269
how can I help?

162
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:29,361
You know, if you don't
want to talk to me,

163
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,016
is there anyone out here
that you would like to talk to?

164
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:35,498
Can I hear your voice?

165
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:39,154
Just to know that you're okay.

166
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,243
Please?

167
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,813
We need to find out everything
we can about the copilot,

168
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,510
Bruno Lessio.

169
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:48,642
Okay, I'm on it.

170
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,208
All right, and I'll
contact the FAA.

171
00:07:50,252 --> 00:07:52,341
Let us know if you guys
need anything else.

172
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:53,647
What about some parachutes?

173
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,105
You know,
if you don't want to talk

174
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,696
through the door,
Bruno, let me in.

175
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,569
Then if you change your mind
and want me to leave, I will go.

176
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,528
Progress?

177
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,530
No.

178
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,532
Becky, do you know him?

179
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,709
Not really. We've crewed a
couple of short hauls together.

180
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,538
He's serious. Quiet.

181
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,757
Depressed?

182
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,502
Bruno, you want
some food or a drink?

183
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:26,375
You know, if you don't want
to answer my questions,

184
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,858
maybe you'd like
to ask me something?

185
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:28,943
Yes.

186
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,640
Go ahead.

187
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:33,774
Do you believe in Hell?

188
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:36,211
Becky? Becky?

189
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,343
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Listen to me.God.

190
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,365
Listen to me. I-I need you
to keep it together, okay?

191
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,825
Yeah?

192
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,699
It sounds like
you're a moral person.

193
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,570
That's, that's great to hear.

194
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:51,574
Would you like to talk to
a religious or spiritual leader?

195
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,188
Come on, Bruno. What's going on?
Where are we going?

196
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:58,973
Denver.

197
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,018
Why Denver?

198
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,154
He says we're going to Denver.
How long will that take?

199
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:09,026
90 minutes.

200
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,940
Captain, what are you doing?

201
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,376
Talking to flight center.

202
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,770
We're finding a way in there.
Is that possible?

203
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:16,425
Well, we're gonna
make it possible.

204
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,994
The FAA is gonna instruct

205
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:22,736
the captain to give you and Eric
his full cooperation,

206
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,173
but it's at his discretion.

207
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:28,045
He's hardly discreet.
Any idea why Denver?

208
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,918
No one has a clue.

209
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:33,050
There's nothing that connects
the copilot to Denver,

210
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:35,289
he's never flown there, and
there's nothing going on there.

211
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,314
I'm looking at the guy's

212
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,446
social media page.

213
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,013
He has friends, family.

214
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,493
Bruno Lessio seems
like a pretty happy guy.

215
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:44,627
Bought an apartment
in Montreal six months ago.

216
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,431
Promising career.
He even made plans this weekend.

217
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,848
Yeah, he doesn't sound suicidal.

218
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,458
What is it, then? OLIVER: I don't know.

219
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,460
We're gonna go
check out Bruno's apartment.

220
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,070
Police are on their
way there now.

221
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,158
We'll be in touch.

222
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,464
Hey.

223
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:56,659
Bruno, this is Captain Tremblay.

224
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,423
If you do not open this door,

225
00:09:58,467 --> 00:10:00,643
I am gonna take a crash axe
and pry open a panel

226
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,427
until I get to the avionics bay.

227
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,821
Then I am gonna start pulling
out hydraulic circuit boards

228
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,649
until you can
no longer fly the plane.

229
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:07,781
Do you under...

230
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:10,435
Your threats will not
persuade him, sir.

231
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,916
Well, your talk isn't exactly
persuading him either, is it?

232
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,657
Maybe Bruno will land
the plane in Denver.

233
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,617
No, pilot hijackings
generally mean pilot suicides.

234
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,967
If he attempts to fly us
over downtown Denver,

235
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,665
the Air Force is gonna knock us
out of the sky, do you get that?

236
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,233
If you rip out the electronics,
then who's gonna fly the plane?

237
00:10:25,276 --> 00:10:27,235
I will know which circuits
work and which won't.

238
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,846
I will have ground
operation support, he won't.

239
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,543
But you'd have to get inside.

240
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:32,806
Yes.

241
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:34,634
What about autopilot?

242
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,853
Autopilot does not land
a plane like this.

243
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:40,291
Listen, if we do not open that
door and get inside, we die.

244
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:41,945
Captain.

245
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:43,860
Can you tell us what's
happening, please?

246
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:46,297
Yeah, of-of course I can.
I'm so sorry.

247
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,473
Yo, guys, guys.

248
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,650
Um, did you hear
what's going on up there?

249
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,695
I heard someone said
there's a hijacking.

250
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,175
- No way.
- That's insane.

251
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,831
Would you guys be willing
to give me a hand?

252
00:10:57,874 --> 00:11:01,138
I'm their coach.
What's going on?

253
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,054
Well, we have a situation.

254
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,449
My God, I'm cursed.

255
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,757
Bruno, open the cockpit door, or the
captain's gonna do something rash.

256
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,542
Now, I can come in and broker an
arrangement between the two of you.

257
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:16,806
Whatever the problem is,
we cansolve it.

258
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,199
Okay.

259
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,375
Captain Tremblay can come in.

260
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,419
But no one else.

261
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,639
Eric.

262
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,555
Listen, he's willing
to let you back in,

263
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,339
but everybody else
has to stand back, okay?

264
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,601
Those are his terms.

265
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,734
Okay. Okay. I can take this.

266
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,823
Why is he letting me back in?

267
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,044
Maybe he changed his mind.
Could be a trick.

268
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,002
Maybe. But, Captain,
no pressure on him, okay?

269
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:41,222
Don't threaten.
Just... let him talk.

270
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,702
And listen.

271
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,097
If you're calm,
he's calm, all right?

272
00:11:53,669 --> 00:11:55,845
My eyes! My eyes!

273
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,978
Go, go, go!

274
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,328
Guys, no, stop!
The door is impenetrable!

275
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,764
You're only gonna provoke him!

276
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,026
Open the door! Get back.

277
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,767
Get off! Get back!

278
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,046
Enough, Bruno.
We get the message.

279
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,318
Anybody hurt?

280
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,929
Are you okay?

281
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:38,148
Everybody okay?

282
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,933
Yeah.

283
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:42,457
Yeah, we're okay. You?

284
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,937
Yeah, I'm fine. Evie?

285
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,895
Yeah, I'm okay, except...

286
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,767
now the only person
who can land the plane

287
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,090
is the guy who's gonna crash it.

288
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,901
Yeah.

289
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:18,667
I'm okay, Dad. No, it's okay.

290
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,974
If you need me, just tell the flight...
We got it.

291
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,323
Okay. Just stay in your seat

292
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,455
with your seat belt on.

293
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,805
Both of you.

294
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,328
Is Evie okay?

295
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,243
She's a trouper.
What about the captain?

296
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:31,114
We flushed out as
much as we could.

297
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,421
His vision impairment
is only temporary.

298
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,162
But I'm not an ophthalmologist.

299
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,728
Who are you guys?

300
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,993
We're professional negotiators.

301
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:43,474
The man in the cockpit can still
land the plane, and he will.

302
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,128
We just need to persuade him.

303
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,217
The key here is not to panic.

304
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,021
Outside this plane,
there are thousands of people

305
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,482
figuring out what to do,
so we're not alone.

306
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,224
Good speech.

307
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,313
I just wish I believed it.

308
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,967
Now what?

309
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,752
I saw Bruno earlier
in the boarding area.

310
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,972
What was his mood? Good.

311
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,366
I spoke to him;
He was pleasant, smiling.

312
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,716
He gave me the Munchers, but...

313
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,675
I sensed only fear and
resignation from the cockpit.

314
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,155
Well, what changed?

315
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,983
Exactly.

316
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:26,866
Clear to enter.

317
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:30,695
Police! Police!

318
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,004
Okay, thank you.

319
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,572
Eric. I'm glad you called.

320
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,791
I just had two quick minutes
with Montreal police.

321
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,055
Bruno has no criminal history,
and his doctor says

322
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,405
there's no indication
of drug abuse.

323
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,581
He hasn't been diagnosed
with a mental illness.

324
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,452
He isn't taking antidepressants.

325
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,149
I saw Bruno

326
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,411
before we boarded.

327
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,500
Now, he took a call.
Maybe he got bad news.

328
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,284
Can you check his incoming? We already did.

329
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,592
His last call was from
his ex, a Fiona Stemkowska.

330
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:59,681
She lives across the street.
That's how they met.

331
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:00,745
Well, I want to talk to her.

332
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,944
She's on her way.

333
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,641
In fact...

334
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,123
here she is right now.

335
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,737
Eric, we'll call you right back.

336
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,043
Hi.

337
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,003
Hi.

338
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,964
Bruno, it's Eric Beaumont again.

339
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,184
We met earlier.

340
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,273
You gave me the Munchers,
remember?

341
00:15:28,188 --> 00:15:30,146
You got what you wanted, Bruno.

342
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,800
Captain Tremblay
is incapacitated.

343
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:33,933
You are in full control.

344
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,979
Whatever you think is in Denver,
maybe I can help you find it.

345
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,763
No one can help me.

346
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,940
Why?

347
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,943
Come on, what's gonna happen
if you tell me?

348
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,468
Once we get to Denver

349
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,967
and you've found
what you're looking for,

350
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,124
will you be happy?

351
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:52,821
I'll never be happy.

352
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:56,912
But at least it will stop.

353
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,262
What will stop, Bruno?

354
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,139
Oliver.

355
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:09,620
So, I'm with Fiona Stemkowska.

356
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:11,709
I've briefed her
on the situation.

357
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,929
She said she broke up with
Bruno three weeks ago.

358
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,062
Why'd you break up
with him, Fiona?

359
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:19,935
I-I'm a single mom.
Ethan is my life.

360
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,893
I-I could just tell
Bruno would never commit.

361
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,330
Was the breakup bitter?

362
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,115
No. If anything,
he was relieved.

363
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,377
And the call today?

364
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,292
Friendly.
I-I had left some things

365
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:31,077
at his place,
and I wanted to know

366
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,122
when I could
pick them up. Okay, here's the point.

367
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,733
Fiona said Bruno
would wake up screaming,

368
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:36,952
shaking, sweating.

369
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,606
I tried to talk to him

370
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,956
about it, but... he clams up.

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,827
Classic post-traumatic stress
syndrome.

372
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:44,960
Do you know why he'd have PTSS?

373
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,049
No. We can't figure it out.

374
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,531
Okay. Fiona, do you think
if you talked to Bruno,

375
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:52,837
you could persuade him
to land the plane?

376
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,102
I could give it a try.

377
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,147
So the best way

378
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:00,671
to reach Bruno is
to show him that you care.

379
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:01,977
So try to find a way

380
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,023
to express it. Okay.

381
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:10,725
Okay, we're ready.

382
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:13,945
Bruno, I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

383
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:15,034
Bruno?

384
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,297
Fiona?

385
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,953
I don't know what's going on.

386
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:26,088
You're-you're scaring
a lot of people.

387
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,395
That's not like you.

388
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,962
Open the door.

389
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,095
Land the plane.

390
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,706
You won't be alone.
You'll have me and Ethan.

391
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,709
I want to be alone.

392
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,971
No, Bruno...

393
00:17:40,015 --> 00:17:42,104
I care about you, Fi.

394
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:45,194
I do, I love you, and I...

395
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,240
I love Ethan, too.

396
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:50,460
But you're better off
without me.

397
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:52,114
So is the world.

398
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,637
Bruno.

399
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,945
Bruno, please.

400
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,780
You were in a good mood
earlier, Bruno.

401
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,521
What happened?
Did you talk to someone?

402
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,653
Did you see something?

403
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:15,964
Becky.

404
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,968
Is there a list of
the passengers we can access?

405
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,405
On the airline's Internet.

406
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,843
We can see everything
the flight center sees.

407
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,280
Why?

408
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:29,195
My colleagues on the ground...

409
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,979
I want them to have full access.

410
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,565
It's possible Bruno recognized
one of the passengers

411
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,156
in the waiting area
when he boarded.

412
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,376
Maybe that's what triggered him.

413
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,638
Here.

414
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,770
I'll see what I can do.

415
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,816
Thank you.

416
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,733
Okay, Becky, I'm in. Thanks.

417
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,169
What are you doing?

418
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,432
Flight manifest.
Seeing who's on board.

419
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:52,566
Look, Bruno's passport
from when he was a kid.

420
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:56,439
But the name reads
Bruno Venturi, not Bruno Lessio.

421
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,311
He changed his name.

422
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,748
Looks like it.

423
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,799
He still won't open the door.

424
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,801
God, we're gonna die.

425
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:14,414
No, we're not, okay? My dad
can talk anyone into anything.

426
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:15,589
We shouldn't be here, man.

427
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,132
We should be
with the rest of the team.

428
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,461
None of this would be happening.

429
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,464
Yeah, well, we're not. Are we?
I-I'm sorry, guys.

430
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,814
It's not your fault, man.
Don't worry about it.

431
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:25,052
Yeah, man, don't worry about it.

432
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,513
What are you guys talking about?

433
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:27,620
Is it about the roof party?

434
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,732
What roof party?

435
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,432
Hey.

436
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,868
Hey!

437
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:35,696
This is nobody's fault.
We're a team.

438
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:36,827
We stick together.

439
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,527
Sit down.

440
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,838
Bruno Venturi,
first-round soccer draft pick

441
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,188
and said to be a star.

442
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,842
But then his stats tumbled.

443
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:54,280
Sports articles trashed him.

444
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,325
Soccer social media
started to harass him.

445
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,110
Is that why he changed his
name and got out of the game?

446
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,419
Wait a second. Gord McDougall.

447
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:04,942
Who's Gord McDougall?

448
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,162
It can't be a coincidence.

449
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,250
What? What?

450
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,469
Gord McDougall has

451
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:10,750
one of the best win/loss records

452
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,863
of any Canadian soccer coach
in history.

453
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,170
He's on the flight
with three of his players,

454
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,694
and he was Bruno's old coach.

455
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,566
I got it.

456
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:23,613
What's going on?

457
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,356
The copilot is Bruno Venturi.

458
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,230
He's flying the plane? Bruno?

459
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,275
Yes. You didn't recognize him?

460
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,799
N-No. I... I haven't seen him
in a dozen years.

461
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,801
He was, like, 16
last time I saw him.

462
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:38,976
And you cut him?

463
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,543
Yeah.

464
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,242
But I fought to keep him.
He knows that.

465
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,721
But Bruno being cut
from the team

466
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,027
and now seeing the uniforms...

467
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,246
Let me talk to him.

468
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,596
Look, despite how it
ended, Bruno and I,

469
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,901
we share an unbreakable bond.

470
00:20:50,945 --> 00:20:52,575
I wasn't just his coach,
I was his mentor,

471
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,556
his teacher.

472
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,210
I can get that door open

473
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,168
a lot faster than
that negotiator up there,

474
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,301
that's for sure.

475
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,626
Why'd you change
your name, Bruno?

476
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,869
I didn't.

477
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,697
There's a passport
in your apartment.

478
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,308
And you never even told Fiona
you played soccer.

479
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:07,396
She had no idea.

480
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,137
I never played soccer.

481
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:12,401
Bruno, I'll be right back.

482
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,621
I'm not going anywhere.

483
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,449
His coach wants
to speak with him.

484
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,407
I agree.

485
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,888
But we're running out
of time and strategies.

486
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,281
All right.

487
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,631
Bruno is denying
he ever even played soccer.

488
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:27,024
You can't say anything
that might provoke his anger.

489
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,046
No problem. I know what to say.
Okay, w-what's that?

490
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,550
Just watch me.

491
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,683
Listen, I hear
anything I don't like,

492
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,555
I'm gonna end the conversation.

493
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,992
So you know.

494
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,255
Yeah.

495
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,955
Bruno.

496
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,610
Hi. It's Coach McDougall.

497
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:51,658
I miss you, buddy.

498
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:54,922
Hey, you know, I still remember
that game against Costa Rica.

499
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:56,576
You got the rebound
off the crossbar,

500
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,099
headed it into the corner.

501
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,449
Man, that was
a beautiful finish.

502
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,629
Listen, Bruno, I understand
what it must be like

503
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:09,632
seeing those guys
get on the plane, but...

504
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:12,156
you got to understand,

505
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,378
not everybody can succeed in
the game, and-and that's okay.

506
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:19,338
I mean, you're a pilot.

507
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,949
The point is to succeed at life,

508
00:22:21,992 --> 00:22:23,864
and clearly, Bruno,
you've done that.

509
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,431
Now land the plane,

510
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,562
and then we'll talk.

511
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,085
Whatever you need, man, you...

512
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,305
Hey, check it out. It's a fighter.

513
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,264
They gonna shoot us down?

514
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,396
Look out the window.

515
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,398
No, they're here to help us.

516
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,054
There's a second
fighter on the starboard side.

517
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,447
They're gonna provoke him.

518
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,318
This is NORAD Defense Systems.

519
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,667
Please respond with your status

520
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,540
or we will be forced
to take defensive action.

521
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,629
Is he dumping our fuel?

522
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:53,826
If he doesn't switch it off,
we won't have enough fuel

523
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,505
to land the plane anywhere.

524
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,547
Colonel, we can't negotiate
under the barrel of a gun.

525
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,375
You got to get those
fighter jets away from us.

526
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,575
We cannot allow your plane
to be turned into a weapon.

527
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,794
We're still 30 minutes
from Denver.

528
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:27,101
Sorry, these orders
come straight from the top.

529
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,538
With all due respect, Colonel,
you're full of crap.

530
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:30,907
The White House
wouldn't order a shoot down

531
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:32,541
until the last second.

532
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:35,152
Your orders are to tag and tail,
but you're following too close.

533
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:37,198
You're gonna provoke
the copilot into crashing.

534
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,722
How's that gonna affect
your career, Colonel?

535
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:42,856
I'll pull them back three miles.
That's the best I can do.

536
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,379
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

537
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,989
Well played.Yeah.

538
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,873
"Cover your butt"
always works in the military.

539
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,217
Even if we get close
to downtown, they're gonna

540
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,566
execute the shoot order.

541
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,742
We have to get Bruno
heading away from Denver.

542
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:02,963
If he doesn't turn off that
fuel dump, that won't matter.

543
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:05,444
Take a look, Bruno.
The F-16s are backing off.

544
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,446
Can we talk now?

545
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,580
Come on, Bruno.
I'm doing everything I can.

546
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:14,104
You got to,
you got to meet me halfway.

547
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,194
Hey, guys.

548
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:20,371
Um, Chris and the boys
have been acting kind of weird.

549
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:22,112
I think there's
something going on.

550
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:24,114
What do you mean?

551
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,859
Are we on comms?

552
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,426
Loud and clear.

553
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,168
We need to talk. Privately.

554
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,867
Can we talk? Yes.

555
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,479
Please, have a seat.

556
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,709
Hey.

557
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:56,320
Listen, my name is Eric, okay?

558
00:24:56,364 --> 00:25:00,803
Chris, you have to tell me what
really happened last night.

559
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,805
It might be the difference

560
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:06,026
between this plane
landing or crashing.

561
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,463
Evie, can you give us five?

562
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,421
Yeah.

563
00:25:15,688 --> 00:25:17,646
This is
just like Bruno's behavior

564
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,953
back in the day. He was,
he was always very impulsive.

565
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:23,391
You seemed very moved
when you were talking to him.

566
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:26,525
Of course I was moved.
I love these guys.

567
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,788
And I know that I can
get him to open that door.

568
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,051
You got to give me
another chance.

569
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:33,314
Okay, Cynthia, I think
I got what you're looking for.

570
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,185
A series of legal
settlements and NDAs

571
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:36,665
all associated with the team,

572
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:40,495
Coach Gord McDougall.

573
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,149
Maybe.

574
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:44,344
But first can you tell me about
the nondisclosure agreements?

575
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:47,241
I'm sorry.

576
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,610
I don't know what
you're talking about.

577
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,201
NDA dated July 12, 2008.

578
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,507
A second one dated.

579
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,727
May 29, 2010.May 29, 2010.

580
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,033
July 12, 2008.

581
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,340
What's going on, Coach?

582
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,037
What did you do? Nothing.

583
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,126
Then what's in those agreements?

584
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,476
What can't you talk about?

585
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,348
Physical abuse?

586
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:09,263
Verbal abuse?

587
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,047
Steroids? Okay, look.

588
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,920
These are kids. You know, we
have to protect their privacy.

589
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:17,097
I was drinking last night.

590
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,580
But...

591
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,625
it wasn't 'cause we won.

592
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:29,544
Coach, he...

593
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,982
he called me
into his hotel room,

594
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:36,551
like... like he always does.

595
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:43,602
You really want to hear this?

596
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,779
Yeah, I need to...
I need to know the truth.

597
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,651
I couldn't take it anymore.

598
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:56,223
I went out on my balcony and...

599
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,268
I-I thought about jumping.

600
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:02,533
But then Liam and Sean,
they-they came and...

601
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,100
They-they stopped you.

602
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,672
If I say anything,
no one will believe me.

603
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,806
I-If they say anything,
they'll get kicked off the team.

604
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:18,027
When you've got
a record like Coach's,

605
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,899
no one wants to hear
about that stuff.

606
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:22,684
You weren't just
Bruno's coach, were you?

607
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,033
You did other things with him.

608
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,340
You got some nerve... And
when he tried to speak,

609
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,211
you got rid of him. You are way off base.

610
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:30,039
Let me talk to him. He is dumping fuel.

611
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,694
We don't land
unless you confess.

612
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:36,437
And then maybe,
maybe we all live.

613
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,614
Well, I'll be at
the front waiting. Think.

614
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:44,140
Hey, I've been analyzing
Bruno's flight path

615
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,664
with the guy at the FAA.

616
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,230
He isn't headed
for downtown Denver.

617
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,668
His vector takes him straight
towards Dunvegan College,

618
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,018
30 miles southwest of the city.

619
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,715
That's the Nabilio scandal.

620
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,586
Remind me.

621
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,414
Dunvegan was
the sight of a major

622
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,764
football sex abuse scandal.

623
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,809
Lance Nabilio was the head
coach who covered it up.

624
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:02,178
That's where Bruno's
crashing the plane.

625
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,420
He's making a statement.

626
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:05,727
But there's a problem, Eric.

627
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:08,164
If he's dumping fuel,
the plane's not gonna make it.

628
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,426
Bruno.

629
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,778
Dunvegan College, right?

630
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,170
Small problem.

631
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,216
Check your fuel gauge.

632
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,479
There's not enough fuel,
is there?

633
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,655
It's a bold statement, Bruno.

634
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,178
I understand it,
and what's more...

635
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:25,094
I want to help, so let me.

636
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,619
There is a young man here.

637
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:32,711
His name is Chris. He's 17.

638
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,409
He wants to talk.

639
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,066
Hold down the button.

640
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:45,941
Hi. I'm-I'm Chris.

641
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:49,336
I-I'm a striker with Montreal.

642
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,730
Eric says you used
to play for us.

643
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,864
Keep going.

644
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:58,475
Look, the coach...

645
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,608
same thing happened to me
that happened to you.

646
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:04,525
For me, it started
three weeks in.

647
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:07,702
I-I don't know why
he picked me, but...

648
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,139
but he did.

649
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,756
I'm sorry, Chris.

650
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:22,978
You can save Chris's future
and bring Coach McDougall

651
00:29:23,022 --> 00:29:26,677
to justice, but first you have
to turn off the fuel dump.

652
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,817
Okay.

653
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,699
That's great, Bruno.

654
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,745
Now let's talk about
finding a runway.

655
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,791
Sure.

656
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,260
Okay. No, there's no way
you're talking to him.

657
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:09,740
I know him.
I know how to talk to him.

658
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:11,046
No, he's agreed
to land the plane.

659
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,854
Come on, Bruno.

660
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,769
You know how much
you meant to me.

661
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,423
Don't you remember
how connected we were,

662
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:17,380
how many great times

663
00:30:17,424 --> 00:30:19,426
we had together? Okay, Coach...

664
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:21,297
Open that... Open the...

665
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:23,386
Get off me! Get off!

666
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,304
You're finished. All of you.

667
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:30,916
You'll never play soccer again.

668
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,835
Bruno, it's over.

669
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:38,401
Chris has come forward.

670
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,099
His teammates have taken
the coach away.

671
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,188
It doesn't matter!

672
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,886
Arresting the coach
won't make a difference.

673
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,366
It's everywhere.

674
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,543
Chris is part of the problem.
I'm part of the problem.

675
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,240
It needs to stop now.

676
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:55,854
Danger. Danger. Danger.

677
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,335
Eric.

678
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:02,991
He's going to crash
into the Rockies.

679
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,994
Danger. Danger.

680
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,343
Danger.

681
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:10,390
Danger. Danger.

682
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:11,913
Danger.

683
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,133
Danger. Danger.

684
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,917
What's happening?

685
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,964
He just purged the oxygen.

686
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:21,967
How much air do we have?12
minutes before we run out.

687
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,144
And if he doesn't repressurize
the cabin, what happens?

688
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,146
We're dead.

689
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,463
No, I got it. Get yours.

690
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,552
All right, all right.

691
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,912
Did you call your mom? I
couldn't get through.

692
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,571
You know, we went
hiking once near Oka.

693
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,271
You disappeared.

694
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,274
You were missing for,
like, 45 minutes.

695
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:12,887
When the park rangers found you,

696
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,671
you had already
gathered berries to eat.

697
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:17,283
You found this little shelter
under a fallen tree.

698
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:19,067
And you were singing.

699
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:20,590
To keep the witches away.

700
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,636
That's right. That's right.

701
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,684
I was in awe.

702
00:32:27,728 --> 00:32:29,686
I still am.

703
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,777
We tried everything
we could. Nothing worked.

704
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:37,259
We're gonna run out
of oxygen soon.

705
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,044
Okay, you guys, hang in there.

706
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,436
This is not over.

707
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,352
Can you be more specific?
'Cause that might help.

708
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,618
Dad?

709
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,276
Yeah.

710
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,800
Why did you push me away?

711
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,851
I thought if I kept my distance,

712
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,375
it would keep you safe.

713
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:10,727
It felt like you abandoned me.

714
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,294
No.

715
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:15,210
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

716
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:20,389
I wish I could've
been a better dad.

717
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,391
You were a better dad.

718
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,354
This will give
you ten minutes more

719
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,269
than the rest of us.

720
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,923
You're our only chance.

721
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,274
Try again. Please.

722
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,371
I'm staying with you
till the end, okay?

723
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:49,288
You can't protect me
from everything, Dad.

724
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,551
Go do your job.

725
00:33:56,251 --> 00:34:00,081
I love you so much, Evie.

726
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:04,607
You are the most important
thing in my life.

727
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:07,045
And you always will be.

728
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,570
You always will be.

729
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:26,542
Isn't there anyone
you want to call?

730
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:34,811
Eric.

731
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:36,509
Yeah?

732
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:40,252
Eric, thank you for everything.

733
00:34:40,295 --> 00:34:42,515
Guys...

734
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,606
it ain't over yet.

735
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:14,329
It's just you and me now, Bruno.

736
00:35:20,509 --> 00:35:23,991
Neither one of us
wants to die alone.

737
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,385
Why not open the door?

738
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:33,365
Wow.

739
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,801
That's some view.

740
00:36:58,955 --> 00:37:00,957
Munchers?

741
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,098
Something you said before
has been eating at me.

742
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,883
You said,
"I'm part of the problem."

743
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:16,973
What did you mean by that?

744
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,410
Nothing.

745
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,500
Nothing?

746
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:23,545
I know this isn't
about vengeance.

747
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:25,939
You wouldn't kill a plane
full of people for that.

748
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,723
There's something else going on.

749
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:31,945
What if you've become
the thing you fear the most?

750
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:36,558
What if the abused
becomes the abuser?

751
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,952
That's why you shied away
from Fiona when she tried

752
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:42,347
to bring her son
into your life, isn't it?

753
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,350
Why you think you need
to kill yourself.

754
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:48,440
And the other players
and the coach.

755
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:51,356
You don't know how else to end
this terrible cycle of abuse,

756
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,748
do you?

757
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:54,794
The thing about PTSS

758
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:59,581
is that sometimes it gives rise
to unwanted thoughts.

759
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:03,063
But thoughts are not
the same as urges.

760
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:06,632
Have you ever acted
on your thoughts, Bruno?

761
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,506
No.

762
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,813
Of course not.

763
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:17,860
Coach McDougall had urges,
and he acted on them,

764
00:38:17,904 --> 00:38:19,862
with complete disregard
for his victims.

765
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:21,603
On the other hand,
I mean, you could've

766
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,650
taken this plane into a nosedive
at any point, but you didn't.

767
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,652
You purged the oxygen

768
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:29,045
so that the passengers
fell asleep peacefully.

769
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,265
You did that out of compassion.

770
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,529
You and the coach
are not the same,

771
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:35,748
and you never will be, okay?

772
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,663
You don't know who I am.

773
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,621
Maybe not.

774
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,711
But Fiona does know.

775
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,539
Caution. Terrain.

776
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,934
Go ahead, Fiona.

777
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:51,067
Bruno? Babe?

778
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:53,374
Caution. Terrain.

779
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,941
Fiona.

780
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:58,597
I-I heard everything.
Why didn't you tell me?

781
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,903
I love you.

782
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,123
I'll be there for you.

783
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:04,777
Caution. Terrain.

784
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,169
We'll be there for you.

785
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:08,258
This won't keep us
away from you.

786
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:09,912
Caution. Terrain.

787
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:11,566
Bruno.

788
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,829
She heard the truth,
and she didn't push you away.

789
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:16,745
You tell the world,
and they will listen.

790
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,400
Nobody listened 12 years ago.

791
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:21,533
Yeah, because
Coach McDougall used his power

792
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,404
to shut you up.

793
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,884
Silence was
his weapon of choice,

794
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,713
but there is nothing more silent
than smoldering wreckage

795
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,976
and dead bodies on the
summit of a mountain.

796
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,586
If you crash this plane,
Coach wins.

797
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,631
You understand that?

798
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,768
The only way to stop the cycle
is to speak up.

799
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,030
Bruno!

800
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,032
Bruno, please!

801
00:39:43,076 --> 00:39:44,338
End the silence.

802
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,905
Danger. Pull up.

803
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:48,429
Danger. Pull up.

804
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,778
Danger. Pull up.

805
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,867
Danger. Pull up.
Danger. Pull up.

806
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:25,640
Air traffic control,
this is Cartier Flight 617

807
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,816
requesting emergency landing.

808
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,992
We'll need emergency vehicles
on the ground.

809
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,909
And oxygen, if you don't mind.

810
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,930
Coach is being held by the FBI.

811
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:56,845
And what about Bruno?

812
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,847
I called a criminal
lawyer I know in Denver,

813
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,154
and he's agreed to
represent Bruno pro bono.

814
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,156
So his story will be heard.

815
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,941
That's great news. Amazing.

816
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:08,161
Bruno's gonna need
some counseling.

817
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:10,729
We'll see what we can do
about that.

818
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:14,341
Okay, let's call it a day.

819
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:15,690
Okay. Later.

820
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,736
Bye.

821
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,963
All right, all right, all right.

822
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,669
Thank you. You saved us all.

823
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:40,367
Okay.

824
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,716
She's exaggerating.

825
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,723
Evie, I don't know what
you remember from the plane,

826
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,682
but these past few months,
I've been keeping you

827
00:41:50,725 --> 00:41:52,355
at a distance because I
thought it would be...

828
00:41:52,379 --> 00:41:54,381
It's okay, Dad.

829
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,905
I won't let anyone
get between us anymore.

830
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,690
From now on,

831
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,822
together, okay?-

832
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:03,085
Cool.

833
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:06,088
I'll still never fly
with you again, though.

834
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,916
Your mother will see to that.

835
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:14,575
Maybe I should...

836
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:17,186
Yeah. Go.

837
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,319
And say thanks.

838
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,416
You okay?

839
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:31,461
Good.

840
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,248
We were gonna die today.

841
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:39,644
And there wasn't anyone
you wanted to call.

842
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:43,517
That's a story for another day.
