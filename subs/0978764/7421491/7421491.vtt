1058
01:49:26.882 --> 01:49:31.929
And yet, I lack the one thing
money can't buy.

1059
01:49:33.432 --> 01:49:36.101
- Love?
- Close.

1060
01:49:37.061 --> 01:49:38.438
Truth...

1061
01:49:39.106 --> 01:49:40.440
...is more accurate.

1062
01:49:43.069 --> 01:49:47.490
I seek a true moment,
a moment of truth.

1063
01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.785
In this...

1064
01:49:50.745 --> 01:49:52.580
...world of lies.

1065
01:49:54.375 --> 01:49:57.127
It just so happens that...

1066
01:49:57.295 --> 01:49:59.505
...that moment...

1067
01:49:59.673 --> 01:50:04.428
...that fragile, delicate thing
like a glass egg...

1068
01:50:04.596 --> 01:50:09.225
...or a sand castle,
well, that moment...

1069
01:50:09.727 --> 01:50:13.647
...can only be given
by a non-faker.

1070
01:50:15.234 --> 01:50:16.902
A non-actor.

1071
01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:19.363
That's you.

1072
01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.824
I don't understand.

1073
01:50:23.703 --> 01:50:25.913
Well, I have spent...

1074
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.709
...a small fortune
getting you in this room.

1075
01:50:30.462 --> 01:50:32.796
This golden cage.

1076
01:50:35.092 --> 01:50:39.055
You're supposed to give yourself to me.

1077
01:50:40.182 --> 01:50:41.933
It's completely physical.

1078
01:50:42.977 --> 01:50:46.773
I might have your body...

1079
01:50:46.941 --> 01:50:49.025
...but the real you that...

1080
01:50:50.402 --> 01:50:54.699
...intangible, and indefinable spark
that is you.

1081
01:50:56.744 --> 01:50:58.955
Well, that you I will never know.

1082
01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:03.544
And, yet, that is precisely what I want.

1083
01:51:11.763 --> 01:51:13.389
I'm sorry.

1084
01:51:15.226 --> 01:51:16.893
You seem really nice.

1085
01:51:19.064 --> 01:51:21.065
You want me to lie to you?

1086
01:51:21.692 --> 01:51:23.735
No, I don't.

1087
01:51:24.404 --> 01:51:26.697
All I require from you...

1088
01:51:27.575 --> 01:51:29.701
...is a sliver of a moment.

1089
01:51:31.413 --> 01:51:33.622
To have you not by force...

1090
01:51:34.916 --> 01:51:37.419
...but simply as a man and a woman.

1091
01:51:39.923 --> 01:51:43.760
To see in your eyes
that simple truth...

1092
01:51:45.013 --> 01:51:47.180
...that you give yourself to me freely.

1093
01:51:48.058 --> 01:51:50.268
Not because you have to...

1094
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:53.063
...but because you want to.

1095
01:51:55.776 --> 01:51:59.571
Now, of course, you're such a gem...

1096
01:52:01.742 --> 01:52:03.451
...I will give as well.

1097
01:52:06.289 --> 01:52:08.291
I'm willing to give you freedom.

1098
01:52:10.461 --> 01:52:12.796
Pure and total freedom.

1099
01:52:13.173 --> 01:52:15.799
Freedom from the drudgery
of every day life...

1100
01:52:17.178 --> 01:52:21.390
...freedom as abstract ideal.

1101
01:52:22.893 --> 01:52:24.770
Freedom from pain...

1102
01:52:27.482 --> 01:52:29.817
...freedom from responsibility...

1103
01:52:32.197 --> 01:52:34.073
...freedom from guilt...

1104
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.535
...from regret...

1105
01:52:39.538 --> 01:52:41.374
...freedom from sadness...

1106
01:52:43.919 --> 01:52:46.046
...freedom from loss...

1107
01:52:49.635 --> 01:52:51.678
...the freedom to be happy.

1108
01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:04.026
Don't close your eyes.

1109
01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:07.114
I need you to look at me.

1110
01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:13.455
The freedom to love.

1111
01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:36.066
Jesus.

1112
01:53:40.906 --> 01:53:42.324
Did...?

1113
01:53:43.326 --> 01:53:45.537
Did you see the way she looked at me?

1114
01:53:47.582 --> 01:53:50.835
Just in that last moment. It was like...

1115
01:53:59.597 --> 01:54:01.055
Doctor?

1116
01:54:01.391 --> 01:54:02.433
Is it done?

1117
01:54:02.601 --> 01:54:06.354
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

1118
01:54:06.522 --> 01:54:09.149
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

1119
01:54:09.317 --> 01:54:12.612
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

1120
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:16.658
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

1121
01:54:16.826 --> 01:54:17.952
Poor child.

1122
01:54:18.913 --> 01:54:23.834
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

1123
01:54:24.002 --> 01:54:26.546
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

1124
01:54:26.714 --> 01:54:28.465
Oh, I'm afraid not.

1125
01:54:28.633 --> 01:54:30.968
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

1126
01:54:31.136 --> 01:54:36.016
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

1127
01:54:36.184 --> 01:54:38.812
...and helped another patient to escape.

1128
01:54:41.106 --> 01:54:43.651
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

1129
01:54:43.819 --> 01:54:47.656
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

1130
01:54:47.824 --> 01:54:49.157
Well, I...

1131
01:54:53.163 --> 01:54:54.998
DOCTOR:
That is your signature, is it not?

1132
01:54:55.625 --> 01:54:58.503
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

1133
01:54:58.671 --> 01:55:02.341
...and to be honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

1134
01:55:02.509 --> 01:55:06.972
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

1135
01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.348
But this one...

1136
01:55:09.267 --> 01:55:11.352
Something in her eyes.

1137
01:55:11.687 --> 01:55:13.938
I've never seen anyone that...

1138
01:55:14.858 --> 01:55:16.859
It's the way she looked at me.

1139
01:55:17.026 --> 01:55:19.237
It's like she wanted me to do it.

1140
01:55:23.952 --> 01:55:25.369
I hope it helps her.

1141
01:56:08.799 --> 01:56:10.425
Hi.

1142
01:56:13.889 --> 01:56:15.599
You remember me?

1143
01:56:16.601 --> 01:56:20.063
Listen. Listen, I got a bad feeling, okay?

1144
01:56:20.230 --> 01:56:21.439
These boys do too.

1145
01:56:22.483 --> 01:56:24.526
This is not the way
we should be running this place.

1146
01:56:24.694 --> 01:56:26.820
We don't run the place. I run it.

1147
01:56:26.988 --> 01:56:28.823
In the chair.

1149
01:56:34.122 --> 01:56:35.456
...I'm not...

1150
01:56:36.209 --> 01:56:39.294
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
- I'm not doing this.

1151
01:56:39.462 --> 01:56:42.715
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

1152
01:56:42.883 --> 01:56:44.635
I need her in that chair.

1153
01:56:46.513 --> 01:56:49.307
Put her in the goddamn chair!

1154
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:53.980
Thank you.

1155
01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.528
Close the door, please.

1156
01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.457
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

1157
01:57:09.625 --> 01:57:13.587
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1158
01:57:13.755 --> 01:57:15.464
No, no, no.

1159
01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:20.012
You're still here.

1160
01:57:20.347 --> 01:57:22.515
You're here with me.

1161
01:57:24.059 --> 01:57:26.020
In all this shit.

1162
01:57:27.188 --> 01:57:30.025
And you don't go away unless I say so.

1163
01:57:30.776 --> 01:57:32.193
Okay?

1164
01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.713
That's not right.

1165
01:57:48.173 --> 01:57:50.133
That's not right.

1166
01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:51.843
Come back.

1167
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.519
No! No!

1168
01:57:59.687 --> 01:58:01.564
I said you don't go!

1169
01:58:02.316 --> 01:58:04.442
You come back to me.

[DOOR OPENS]

1171
01:58:07.572 --> 01:58:10.408
- Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
GORSKI: What are you doing?

1172
01:58:10.576 --> 01:58:13.746
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

1173
01:58:13.914 --> 01:58:15.915
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

1174
01:58:16.083 --> 01:58:18.752
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

1175
01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.339
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.

1176
01:58:21.507 --> 01:58:24.550
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

1177
01:58:24.718 --> 01:58:27.262
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

1178
01:58:28.097 --> 01:58:29.849
Tell them!

1179
01:58:30.017 --> 01:58:31.434
Get him out of here.

1180
01:58:31.602 --> 01:58:35.105
- Now.
- Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

1181
01:58:35.273 --> 01:58:37.526
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

1182
01:58:37.693 --> 01:58:41.405

I'll tell you about the money.

1187

<i>The mystery of whose story it will be...</i>

01:59:11.735 --> 01:59:14.196
<i>...of who draws the curtain.</i>

<i>Who is it that chooses our steps

Is there a problem, gentlemen?

02:00:07.013 --> 02:00:09.806
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

1201
02:00:09.974 --> 02:00:12.810
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

1202
02:00:12.978 --> 02:00:14.855
- We understand.
- Do you?

1203
02:00:15.023 --> 02:00:17.524
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

1204
02:00:17.692 --> 02:00:21.905
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

1205
02:00:22.073 --> 02:00:23.240
Is that true, miss?

1206
02:00:23.408 --> 02:00:27.245
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.

- I know. It's okay.
