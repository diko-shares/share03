00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:11.026
<i>Everyone has an angel.</i>

2
00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.931
<i>A guardian who watches over us.</i>

3
00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:18.561
<i>We can't know what form they'll take.</i>

4
00:00:19.355 --> 00:00:21.440
<i>One day, old man.</i>

5
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.695
<i>Next day, little girl.</i>

6
00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:30.034
<i>But don't let appearances fool you.</i>

7
00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.329
<i>They can be as fierce as any dragon.</i>

8
00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:37.626
<i>Yet they're not here
to fight our battles...</i>

9
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:40.839
<i>but to whisper from our heart...</i>

10
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.383
<i>reminding that it's us.</i>

11
00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:48.807
<i>It's every one of us who holds
the power over the worlds we create.</i>

12
00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.379
No!

13
00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:15.507
No.

14
00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:13.637
<i>We can deny our angels exist...</i>

15
00:05:13.805 --> 00:05:16.682
<i>convince ourselves they can't be real.</i>

16
00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.812
<i>But they show up anyway.</i>

17
00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.064
<i>At strange places.</i>

18
00:05:22.232 --> 00:05:24.651
<i>And at strange times.</i>

19
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:28.656
<i>They can speak through any character
we can imagine.</i>

20
00:05:28.824 --> 00:05:31.450
<i>They'll shout through demons
if they have to...</i>

21
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.829
<i>daring us...</i>

22
00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:36.290
<i>challenging us to fight.</i>

23
00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:35.739
Female. Age 20.

24
00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:14.913
- You're the father?
- Stepfather.

25
00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.751
That's right. We talked on the phone.

26
00:07:23.883 --> 00:07:26.427
Okay, come with me.

27
00:07:26.595 --> 00:07:28.805
We're gonna take her into the theater.

28
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:34.187
Dr. Gorski's gonna want to take a look
at her. She likes to see all the new girls.

29
00:07:35.147 --> 00:07:38.192
Don't worry, Dad.
Everything's gonna be fine.

30
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.320
I've got everything under control
around here.

31
00:07:42.365 --> 00:07:44.157
Okay? Come on. Follow me.

32
00:07:58.135 --> 00:08:01.345
So this is what we call the theater.

33
00:08:14.905 --> 00:08:16.281
Liar!

34
00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:19.243
Oh, girls. Yes, go, go.

35
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:21.078
Hey. Come here.

36
00:08:21.246 --> 00:08:23.081
Girls. Behave.

37
00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:25.625
- Break it up. Break it up.
- Will you stop them?

38
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.712
Lynn.

39
00:08:28.922 --> 00:08:30.591
Amy.

40
00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.217
Sit down.

41
00:08:32.385 --> 00:08:33.427
Sit.

42
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:39.769
Anyway.
So the girls use this place to be social.

43
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:44.358
Dr. Gorski, she uses it to help them
deal with their issues.

44
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.820
Polish therapy.

45
00:08:48.572 --> 00:08:52.826
It's quite a show, watching them act out
who touched them or beat them.

46
00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:55.413
Dr. Gorski seems to think it helps.
I'm not so sure.

47
00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:58.416
But whether it does or doesn't
won't matter much to you.

48
00:08:58.585 --> 00:09:01.170
Once we take care of
a little bit of business...

49
00:09:01.338 --> 00:09:03.882
- there won't be any of that for this one.
- Good.

50
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.595
She'll be in paradise,
if you know what I mean.

51
00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:13.268
And all of your troubles will be over.

52
00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:18.650
Now, I know we said 1400
on the phone...

53
00:09:20.946 --> 00:09:22.822
I'm taking a really big risk here...

54
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.617
so it's gonna have to be 2 grand even.

55
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:28.454
What the hell are you talking about?
We had a deal.

56
00:09:28.622 --> 00:09:33.627
Listen, Father,
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

57
00:09:33.795 --> 00:09:36.172
Clearly you're a man that can take
care of himself.

58
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.886
I don't know what you did to this girl.
And, frankly, I don't wanna know.

59
00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:44.141
What are you gonna tell the detectives
when they come around?

60
00:09:44.308 --> 00:09:46.476
They're gonna love her side of the story.

61
00:09:46.644 --> 00:09:48.062
- Yeah.
- Okay.

62
00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:51.065
I'm going to start your music.

63
00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:53.360
You are safe.

64
00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:55.237
It's all safe.

65
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:58.366
Now relax.

66
00:09:58.826 --> 00:09:59.994
And just let go.

67
00:10:02.664 --> 00:10:04.875
Now, here's the other thing:

68
00:10:05.042 --> 00:10:07.920
I don't have a doctor on staff
who does lobotomies.

69
00:10:08.088 --> 00:10:10.506
- What?
- But...

70
00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:14.178
there happens to be one scheduled
to come in in five days.

71
00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:17.265
So I'll just forge her signature.
I've done it a dozen times.

72
00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:18.933
It's like we talk about.

73
00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:21.353
You control this world.

74
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:25.192
I told the police
she lost her mind when her mother died.

75
00:10:25.359 --> 00:10:27.527
The truth is a little more complicated.

76
00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:29.864
Let the pain go.

77
00:10:30.699 --> 00:10:32.618
Let the hurt go.

78
00:10:33.578 --> 00:10:35.954
Let the guilt go.

79
00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:39.334
What you're imagining right now...

80
00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:42.087
that world you control?

81
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:45.342
That place can be as real as any pain.

82
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.511
I don't want her to remember a thing.

83
00:10:47.678 --> 00:10:52.643
Don't worry, she won't even remember
her name when I'm done with her.

84
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.010
Stop.

85
00:12:27.637 --> 00:12:29.722
Get that thing away from me.

86
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.931
Get it away from me.

87
00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:32.975
<i>Where is my mind?</i>

88
00:12:33.143 --> 00:12:35.479
And shut off that damn music.

89
00:12:37.106 --> 00:12:39.108
Undo these straps.

90
00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:42.112
Don't forget my ankles.

91
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:45.199
Hurry.

92
00:12:46.535 --> 00:12:49.162
Is there a problem, Sweet Pea?

93
00:12:49.664 --> 00:12:51.999
This is a joke, right?

94
00:12:54.337 --> 00:12:56.630
Don't you get the point of this?

95
00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:58.549
It's to turn people on.

96
00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:01.260
I get the sexy little schoolgirl.

97
00:13:01.428 --> 00:13:05.140
I even get the helpless mental patient,
right? That can be hot.

98
00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:06.893
But what is this?

99
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.978
Lobotomized vegetable?

100
00:13:10.565 --> 00:13:14.486
How about something a little more
commercial, for God's sakes?

101
00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:17.948
Sweet Pea,
could you come here, please?

102
00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:27.168
You gotta help me.

103
00:13:27.962 --> 00:13:29.879
I'm the star of the show, remember?

104
00:13:30.047 --> 00:13:32.174
I'll figure something out.

105
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:33.968
All right, ladies. Wrap it up.

106
00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:36.888
Sweet Pea, I want you
to meet somebody. This...

107
00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:38.140
Don't tell me.

108
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:42.771
The priest brought you here from the
orphanage to lose your virginity, right?

109
00:13:42.939 --> 00:13:46.066
Oh, let me rephrase that.

110
00:13:46.234 --> 00:13:47.277
To sell it.

111
00:13:47.445 --> 00:13:49.446
Heh, heh, heh. Yeah, that's right.

112
00:13:49.989 --> 00:13:51.782
How original.

113
00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:54.493
The High Roller is coming for her
in five days.

114
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:58.165
He's gonna, you know,
just do a little flower picking.

115
00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:00.543
And he's gonna pay
a lot of money for that.

116
00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:02.086
Mm. Luck you.

117
00:14:02.296 --> 00:14:03.964
Can you do me a favor, honey?

118
00:14:04.132 --> 00:14:07.969
Can you show this little baby doll around,
give her a tour of the establishment?

119
00:14:08.137 --> 00:14:12.975
Blue, you saw the show, okay?
I don't have the time.

120
00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:14.643
Let my sister take her.

121
00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.314
Rocket.

122
00:14:22.988 --> 00:14:25.324
Show her around, will you, sis?

123
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:31.080
All right, come on. Let's go.

124
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.211
Don't worry, I don't bite very hard.

125
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.339
Goodbye, my dear.

126
00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:39.759
- Jesus!
- Oh...

127
00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:41.696
You'll get what you deserve
when the High Roller comes!

128
00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.429
- Calm down.
- I will not calm down.

129
00:14:43.598 --> 00:14:46.266
- You see what she did? I hope you rot!
- I did. I'm sorry.

130
00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:48.102
This way.

131
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:53.859
You're gonna be okay. It just
takes a little while to get used to.

132
00:14:54.402 --> 00:14:57.405
So how'd you become an orphan?

133
00:14:57.573 --> 00:15:01.035
Oh, I get it. It's complicated, right?

134
00:15:01.203 --> 00:15:04.248
Well, we all have our stories in here.
Mine's...

135
00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:05.499
complicated.

136
00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:09.879
These are the rooms
where we take the clients.

137
00:15:10.047 --> 00:15:13.884
There's fresh towels
in all the bathrooms and...

138
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.266
Turn that on.

139
00:15:22.062 --> 00:15:24.481
Blue owns the club.

140
00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:27.484
And we, my dear, heh...

141
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:31.781
are the main attractions. Ta-da.

142
00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:34.702
The club's a front for his business.

143
00:15:34.869 --> 00:15:38.415
Guns, gambling, medications,
special favors.

144
00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:43.713
He brings in his clients,
and we gotta make them feel, you know...

145
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.465
special.

146
00:15:45.967 --> 00:15:47.092
New girl.

147
00:15:48.762 --> 00:15:50.638
This is our backstage.

148
00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:56.437
It's just for us, so don't bring any clients
back here, okay? Or Blue's gonna get pissed.

149
00:15:57.023 --> 00:16:00.150
Uh, cleaning closet.

150
00:16:00.318 --> 00:16:04.698
You'll find all the
mops, brooms, disinfectants.

151
00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:07.618
New girls get cleaning duties.

152
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:10.872
I don't make the rules.

153
00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:15.044
And if you don't do what you're told,
Blue locks us in here...

154
00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:17.964
until we become
a bit more cooperative.

155
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:21.552
Don't worry.
It's not gonna happen to you.

156
00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:26.475
This is the kitchen.

157
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.769
We all work in here.

158
00:16:34.319 --> 00:16:35.861
Time for rehearsal.

159
00:16:37.948 --> 00:16:40.325
- She looked nice.
- She looked stuck-up to me.

160
00:16:40.493 --> 00:16:42.328
No. She's scared.

161
00:16:42.496 --> 00:16:43.579
I feel sorry for her.

162
00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:45.957
Amber, you feel sorry for everyone.

163
00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:50.004
Do you remember when you first got here?
Nobody felt sorry for you.

164
00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:52.799
Well, don't get too attached to her, okay?

165
00:16:52.966 --> 00:16:54.677
Blue's saving her for the High Roller.

166
00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.847
She's no virgin.

167
00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:04.021
Baby doll, that's Amber, Blondie,
and you've met my sister, Sweet Pea.

168
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:06.441
- Watch yourself.
- Come on, just give her a break.

169
00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.777
Yeah, she hasn't done anything
to you guys.

170
00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:10.571
You best friends now?

171
00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:12.990
Will you just let me finish my tour,
please?

172
00:17:15.453 --> 00:17:16.787
Thank you.

173
00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:21.042
Everybody gets a dance, a routine.

174
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.755
We practice, practice, practice,
and the men come and watch us perform.

175
00:17:24.923 --> 00:17:27.926
And if they like what they see...

176
00:17:28.928 --> 00:17:32.640
Well, you'll see tonight.

177
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.481
Good evening, gentlemen.

178
00:17:38.649 --> 00:17:41.443
We've got a great night
in store for you.

179
00:17:41.902 --> 00:17:44.071
I see a lot of new faces out there.

180
00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:46.073
As well as some familiar ones.

181
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:47.993
So I'm not gonna yammer on too long.

182
00:17:48.161 --> 00:17:51.706
I want you all to sit back,
enjoy the service...

183
00:17:51.874 --> 00:17:53.666
the scenery.

184
00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:55.919
But most of all, enjoy the show.

185
00:17:57.505 --> 00:17:58.923
Hit it.

186
00:18:07.268 --> 00:18:09.186

Give me that.

234
00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:03.543
Somebody! Help me!

235
00:24:10.553 --> 00:24:11.721
Shh.

236
00:24:24.154 --> 00:24:26.072
Let her go, pig.

237
00:24:30.745 --> 00:24:32.830
I didn't mean nothing.

238
00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:35.750
Just having a little fun.

239
00:24:50.019 --> 00:24:51.603
Are you okay?

240
00:24:53.649 --> 00:24:54.691
Yeah. Let's just go.

241
00:24:56.695 --> 00:24:58.612
We don't wanna be late.

242
00:24:59.906 --> 00:25:03.952
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

243
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.291
Two, two, three, four,
arms, six, seven, eight. Stop.

244
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.752
Stop.

245
00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:13.965
Where are you right now?

246
00:25:14.466 --> 00:25:16.592
Are you with us or not?

247
00:25:18.013 --> 00:25:19.471
Sweet Pea, take break.

248
00:25:20.181 --> 00:25:21.433
Yeah.

249
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:30.277
Baby doll.

250
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:32.989
Come over here.

251
00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:34.866
Come, come.

252
00:25:40.332 --> 00:25:42.167
Let me look at you.

253
00:25:47.966 --> 00:25:49.343
Hm.

254
00:25:51.637 --> 00:25:53.181
You seem fit enough.

255
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.726
I'm going to play you some music, okay?

256
00:25:56.894 --> 00:26:01.273
I want you to just relax. Feel the music.

257
00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:04.861
Open your heart to it. Let it in.

258
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:06.447
And when you are ready...

259
00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:09.158
I want you to dance.

260
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:42.992
If you do not dance,
you have no purpose.

261
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.207
And we don't keep things here
that have no purpose.

262
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:53.755
You see, your fight for survival
starts right now.

263
00:26:54.174 --> 00:26:57.427
You don't want to be judged?
You won't be.

264
00:26:57.594 --> 00:27:01.306
You don't think you're strong enough?
You are.

265
00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:05.353
You're afraid. Don't be.

266
00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.482
You have all the weapons you need.

267
00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:09.984
Now fight.

268
00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:12.571
Again.

269
00:27:41.649 --> 00:27:43.818
<i>Stand up</i>

270
00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.411
<i>You've got to manage</i>

271
00:28:52.071 --> 00:28:53.655
Hello?

272
00:28:57.536 --> 00:28:59.662
- Excuse me, could you help me? I'm...
- Shoes.

273
00:29:01.457 --> 00:29:03.292
I'm sorry?

274
00:29:03.459 --> 00:29:05.378
Your shoes.

275
00:29:05.629 --> 00:29:08.382
You're tracking snow everywhere.

276
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.468
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I take them off?

277
00:29:11.636 --> 00:29:13.221
That time has passed.

278
00:29:14.473 --> 00:29:16.434
What can I do for you?

279
00:29:17.686 --> 00:29:18.728
Nothing. I just...

280
00:29:18.895 --> 00:29:21.481
Let me ask it another way:

281
00:29:21.941 --> 00:29:23.191
What are you looking for?

282
00:29:24.236 --> 00:29:25.945
A way out, I guess.

283
00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:27.196
You guess?

284
00:29:28.325 --> 00:29:29.783
No, I...

285
00:29:30.952 --> 00:29:32.454
I know.

286
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.540
I need to get out of here.

287
00:29:35.708 --> 00:29:37.710
Freedom.

288
00:29:37.878 --> 00:29:39.295
That wasn't so hard, was it?

289
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.133
I'm going to help you to be free.

290
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:44.510
What do I have to do?

291
00:29:48.307 --> 00:29:51.060
These are your weapons.

292
00:29:55.107 --> 00:29:57.443
When you take them,
you begin your journey.

293
00:29:58.278 --> 00:30:00.529
Your journey to freedom.

294
00:30:14.632 --> 00:30:17.843
You will need five items for this journey.

295
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:20.304
The first is a map.

296
00:30:20.472 --> 00:30:23.392
Then fire, a knife and a key.

297
00:30:24.352 --> 00:30:26.104
You said five things.

298
00:30:26.271 --> 00:30:28.940
The fifth thing is a mystery.

299
00:30:29.192 --> 00:30:32.569
It is the reason. It is the goal.

300
00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:37.618
It will be a deep sacrifice
and a perfect victory.

301
00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:45.127
Only you can find it.

302
00:30:45.754 --> 00:30:47.380
And if you do...

303
00:30:48.924 --> 00:30:51.218
it will set you free.

304
00:30:54.807 --> 00:30:57.183
Oh, and one more thing:

305
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.274
Defend yourself.

306
00:36:05.485 --> 00:36:06.528
What was that?

307
00:36:06.695 --> 00:36:09.489
Seriously, you're gonna have to
teach me how to dance like that.

308
00:36:09.657 --> 00:36:11.033
That was crazy.

309
00:36:11.201 --> 00:36:14.788
That was so amazing. I'm, like, shaking.

310
00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:20.461
I've never seen Madame Gorski
clap like that before.

311
00:36:20.629 --> 00:36:21.879
Well, get over it.

312
00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:23.549
It's nearly lights out.

313
00:36:24.092 --> 00:36:25.926
She's not easily impressed.

314
00:36:26.094 --> 00:36:29.848
She wasn't impressed.
All that gyrating and moaning.

315
00:36:30.015 --> 00:36:32.935
The dance should be
more than just titillation.

316
00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:37.148
Mine's personal. It says who I am.

317
00:36:37.984 --> 00:36:39.610
What the heck does yours say?

318
00:36:39.778 --> 00:36:41.946
It says I'm gonna escape from here.

319
00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:44.157
That I'm gonna be free.

320
00:36:44.784 --> 00:36:47.370
Well, send me a postcard from paradise.

321
00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:51.834
Are you really gonna try to escape?

322
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.171
Yeah. Before the High Roller comes.

323
00:36:55.339 --> 00:36:57.507
- Can I come?
- Me too.

324
00:36:59.678 --> 00:37:02.555
- Yeah, of course.
- You're not going anywhere, Rocket.

325
00:37:02.723 --> 00:37:04.224
I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

326
00:37:04.392 --> 00:37:07.770
No one's ever escaped from here.
You know that.

327
00:37:07.938 --> 00:37:10.857
Yeah. You know, the last three girls
that tried died.

328
00:37:11.526 --> 00:37:13.861
And the same thing'll happen
to the next fool.

329
00:37:14.029 --> 00:37:16.031
Look, why don't you just
listen to my plan?

330
00:37:16.198 --> 00:37:18.366
Don't wanna hear your plan, okay?

331
00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.496
None of us do.

332
00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:40.186
Now, let's get ready, girls.

333
00:37:40.354 --> 00:37:43.064
Rehearsal in 15 minutes.

334
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:07.804
We're not helping Baby.

335
00:38:08.973 --> 00:38:11.474
- Am I clear?
- What if it's a good plan?

336
00:38:11.642 --> 00:38:14.395
Then she can go through with it.

337
00:38:14.688 --> 00:38:16.898
I'm not letting you get hurt.

338
00:38:17.817 --> 00:38:21.946
- I kept us safe through a lot of shit.
- I know you have.

339
00:38:22.447 --> 00:38:24.616
I'm not gonna get hurt.

340
00:38:25.785 --> 00:38:29.622
I just can't be here anymore.

341
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.916
And if it is a good plan,
we're both going.

342
00:38:32.084 --> 00:38:34.294
No, we're not.

343
00:38:35.088 --> 00:38:36.923
You're on your own.

344
00:38:51.567 --> 00:38:54.236
- Well, I've been on my own before.
- Heh.

345
00:38:54.404 --> 00:38:56.238
Sure you have.

346
00:38:57.199 --> 00:38:59.284
Look where that got us.

347
00:39:07.795 --> 00:39:12.425
Baby saved me from the Cook
the other day.

348
00:39:13.011 --> 00:39:14.428
What?

349
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:21.103
I was working in the kitchen
and he comes in behind me.

350
00:39:21.271 --> 00:39:25.108
And he pushes me down
and he gets on top of me...

351
00:39:25.276 --> 00:39:27.444
and I can't even move.

352
00:39:30.532 --> 00:39:33.035
And there she was, just like that.

353
00:39:34.037 --> 00:39:37.040
She had a knife to his throat.

354
00:39:38.042 --> 00:39:39.834
She saved me.

355
00:40:06.327 --> 00:40:08.870
The High Roller comes for me
in three days.

356
00:40:09.623 --> 00:40:11.958
But I'm getting out of here
before he does.

357
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:16.046
So if you guys wanna come with me,
this is how I plan to do it.

358
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.722
Well?

359
00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:25.266
Okay.

360
00:40:26.853 --> 00:40:30.815
If we can collect all four of these items,
we can be free.

361
00:40:30.983 --> 00:40:32.441
Okay.

362
00:40:32.609 --> 00:40:34.111
- How do we use them?
- Wait up.

363
00:40:34.988 --> 00:40:36.822
First things first.

364
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.409
How do you plan on
getting these things?

365
00:40:39.577 --> 00:40:43.414
Well, whoever has the item we need,
we get them to watch me dance.

366
00:40:43.623 --> 00:40:46.209
While we run around
and pick their pockets?

367
00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:49.546
- Yeah, that's right.
- But we'd be taking all the risk.

368
00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:52.550
We'd be doing the work
while you prance around with an alibi.

369
00:40:52.718 --> 00:40:55.804
No. As long as I'm dancing,
they won't even know you're there.

370
00:40:59.393 --> 00:41:02.313
Okay, so the first thing we need
is a map...

371
00:41:03.607 --> 00:41:06.943
to figure out where all the exits are,
where the guards are located.

372
00:41:07.111 --> 00:41:09.905
Blue has that in his office.
It's behind his desk.

373
00:41:10.072 --> 00:41:11.365
Right. Good.

374
00:41:12.242 --> 00:41:14.494
Second thing we need
is something to start a fire with...

375
00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:16.997
as a distraction for when we escape.

376
00:41:17.457 --> 00:41:19.792
<i>Plus, the fire should disable
all the checkpoints.</i>

377
00:41:20.794 --> 00:41:22.755
And the third thing is a knife...

378
00:41:23.423 --> 00:41:24.965
<i>in case we run into trouble.</i>

379
00:41:25.634 --> 00:41:26.676
The Cook.

380
00:41:28.095 --> 00:41:30.555
- We can do it.
- Okay.

381
00:41:30.974 --> 00:41:32.475
And the last thing's a key.

382
00:41:33.894 --> 00:41:35.646
<i>Blue wears a key around his neck.</i>

383
00:41:35.813 --> 00:41:36.980
What door does it open?

384
00:41:37.148 --> 00:41:40.526
It's for all of them, I think.
It's a master key.

385
00:41:40.694 --> 00:41:43.405
This plan is crazy.

386
00:41:43.949 --> 00:41:46.367
There's armed guards everywhere, okay?

387
00:41:46.534 --> 00:41:48.870
And if Blue finds out, we're dead.

388
00:41:49.038 --> 00:41:53.376
It's not gonna be, "Oh, sorry, Blue,
we won't do it again." We'll be dead.

389
00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:56.421
We're already dead.

390
00:42:01.845 --> 00:42:04.306
- I'm in.
- So am I.

391
00:42:04.975 --> 00:42:06.141
Me too.

392
00:42:11.817 --> 00:42:12.942
All right.

393
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:17.948
But I'm only doing this because you
guys'd get caught without me, okay?

394
00:42:18.116 --> 00:42:19.701
And if it gets too hairy...

395
00:42:21.036 --> 00:42:22.829
if I say it's over...

396
00:42:22.997 --> 00:42:24.707
we stop.

397
00:42:24.874 --> 00:42:26.417
Okay.

398
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:29.504
Okay.

399
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:33.551
I'll get the map.

400
00:42:38.933 --> 00:42:41.728
I went for a walk down the railroad track.

401
00:42:41.979 --> 00:42:43.772
Next thing you know, some...

402
00:42:44.691 --> 00:42:47.067
- What do you want?
- She's dancing.

403
00:42:47.485 --> 00:42:48.820
Who is dancing?

404
00:42:49.697 --> 00:42:51.156
Your baby doll.

405
00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:45.015
<i>♪ One pill makes you larger ♪</i>

406
00:43:48.103 --> 00:43:51.689
<i>♪ One pill makes you larger ♪</i>

407
00:43:51.857 --> 00:43:56.320
<i>♪ And one pill makes you small ♪</i>

408
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.215
Baby.

409
00:44:13.969 --> 00:44:15.428
Baby.

410
00:44:16.096 --> 00:44:19.141
He's coming.
He's gonna start the briefing.

411
00:44:43.755 --> 00:44:46.091
All right, here's the drill:

412
00:44:46.259 --> 00:44:49.679
The Germans are preparing a report
for the kaiser. It's a map...

413
00:44:49.847 --> 00:44:52.849
that shows troop locations
and trench layouts.

414
00:44:53.017 --> 00:44:56.395
Their field commander's
sending the map via courier...

415
00:44:56.563 --> 00:44:58.482
back to Germany
on a zeppelin today.

416
00:44:58.691 --> 00:45:00.108
How do we intercept it?

417
00:45:00.276 --> 00:45:03.779
You're gonna cross no man's land,
enter the enemy trenches...

418
00:45:03.947 --> 00:45:06.783
and take the map from
the field commander's bunker...

419
00:45:06.951 --> 00:45:09.119
before the courier
can reach the zeppelin.

420
00:45:09.287 --> 00:45:11.164
Sounds like fun.

421
00:45:11.332 --> 00:45:14.460
Oh, and I've arranged something special
for Amber.

422
00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:16.128
Give you some cover.

423
00:45:16.421 --> 00:45:18.215
Get you out of there when you're done.

424
00:45:20.676 --> 00:45:22.303
Let's go.

425
00:46:20.084 --> 00:46:21.793
What do you think?

426
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:25.590
I like it.

427
00:46:42.612 --> 00:46:44.405
German doctors and engineers...

428
00:46:44.573 --> 00:46:47.868
have worked out how to return
their fallen to the front lines.

429
00:46:48.036 --> 00:46:52.457
They're using steam power and clockworks
to keep them moving.

430
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.212
So don't feel bad about killing them.

431
00:46:59.467 --> 00:47:01.051
They're already dead.

432
00:47:09.145 --> 00:47:10.520
Remember, ladies:

433
00:47:10.855 --> 00:47:12.607
If you don't stand for something...

434
00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:15.276
you'll fall for anything.

435
00:47:16.613 --> 00:47:18.947
Oh, and one last thing:

436
00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:22.494
Try and work together.

437
00:48:33.292 --> 00:48:34.709
Son of a...

438
00:50:25.723 --> 00:50:28.517
Come on, guys. The bunker's this way.

439
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.837
- Cover!
- Rocket!

440
00:50:51.005 --> 00:50:53.548
Sweet Pea! Help!

441
00:51:03.562 --> 00:51:04.896
Unh. Sweet Pea!

442
00:52:16.111 --> 00:52:17.403
Rocket.

443
00:52:21.909 --> 00:52:23.744
Are you okay?

444
00:52:32.005 --> 00:52:33.548
It's right here.

445
00:53:06.381 --> 00:53:09.051
Rocket. That's enough.

446
00:57:49.985 --> 00:57:51.443
Wow.

447
00:57:56.325 --> 00:57:57.660
- Very good.
- Hm.

448
00:57:57.828 --> 00:57:59.537
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

449
00:57:59.705 --> 00:58:00.788
Very good.

450
00:58:04.127 --> 00:58:06.171
Okay, this gives me an idea.

451
00:58:06.338 --> 00:58:10.050
What about a private dance
for the Mayor.

452
00:58:10.218 --> 00:58:11.260
What?

453
00:58:11.428 --> 00:58:14.264
Nothing touchy-feely, just something
to get him wound up.

454
00:58:14.432 --> 00:58:16.099
Get him ready to spend some money.

455
00:58:16.267 --> 00:58:18.394
All she has to do
is do what she did just now.

456
00:58:19.771 --> 00:58:23.525
That is out of the question.
She is not ready. It is too raw.

457
00:58:23.693 --> 00:58:25.235
Did you just say she's not ready?

458
00:58:25.404 --> 00:58:27.530
She doesn't have a costume.
There is no set.

459
00:58:27.698 --> 00:58:31.452
Honey, she doesn't need that bullshit.
She's perfect.

460
00:58:31.661 --> 00:58:35.749
Perhaps. But that is not for you to decide,
that is for me to decide.

461
00:58:35.917 --> 00:58:36.958
Oh.

462
00:58:37.126 --> 00:58:42.257
It's my show, and I say she's not ready.

463
00:58:42.842 --> 00:58:46.596
Clearly, I've offended you,
and I apologize.

464
00:58:46.764 --> 00:58:48.264
Thank you.

465
00:58:48.432 --> 00:58:49.892
Here's the thing:

466
00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.311
This show might be yours...

467
00:58:52.479 --> 00:58:56.858
but the girls and you...

468
00:58:57.945 --> 00:58:59.695
are mine.

469
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:02.824
Right?

470
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.371
You're mine.

471
00:59:07.373 --> 00:59:10.876
And if you need a stronger reminder
of that, you let me know, okay?

472
00:59:12.379 --> 00:59:13.671
That won't be necessary.

473
00:59:13.838 --> 00:59:18.009
So with or without your blessing,
she's gonna be on that stage tomorrow?

474
00:59:20.806 --> 00:59:22.849
- I'll see what I can do.
- Attagirl.

475
00:59:23.017 --> 00:59:24.184
- Mm-hm.
- All right.

476
00:59:24.352 --> 00:59:26.896
You look fantastic, by the way.

477
00:59:28.357 --> 00:59:30.191
Big show, girls.

478
00:59:35.825 --> 00:59:36.866
Thank you.

479
00:59:37.034 --> 00:59:39.412
- For what?
- The Cook.

480
00:59:39.579 --> 00:59:40.913
- It was nothing.
- Shut up.

481
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:45.210
No one takes a risk for anyone in here.

482
00:59:46.129 --> 00:59:47.797
So thank you.

483
00:59:47.965 --> 00:59:49.007
You're welcome.

484
00:59:50.426 --> 00:59:51.677
You got family?

485
00:59:54.222 --> 00:59:55.390
No.

486
00:59:55.808 --> 00:59:57.350
Oh, that's right.

487
00:59:57.518 --> 00:59:59.687
I forgot, you're an orphan.

488
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.064
I ran away from mine.

489
01:00:02.441 --> 01:00:05.569
I thought I was pretty smart
at the time, but...

490
01:00:06.738 --> 01:00:08.239
Sweet Pea followed.

491
01:00:08.824 --> 01:00:13.579
Which is crazy, because she never even
had a real problem with Mom and Dad.

492
01:00:14.622 --> 01:00:17.125
She just cares about you a lot.

493
01:00:19.254 --> 01:00:23.300
Have you just ever wanted
to just take something back?

494
01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:25.761
You know, something you said.

495
01:00:25.928 --> 01:00:27.263
Something you did.

496
01:00:30.809 --> 01:00:32.603
All the time.

497
01:01:27.547 --> 01:01:28.840
<i>Amber?</i>

498
01:01:29.007 --> 01:01:30.550
<i>The Mayor comes tonight.</i>

499
01:01:30.968 --> 01:01:33.679
I've never seen him without
a big stogie in his mouth.

500
01:01:33.847 --> 01:01:37.892
Ugh. I hate those cigars.
I can never get that stink out of my hair.

501
01:01:39.562 --> 01:01:42.523
- What?
- It's you.

502
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:46.194
- You have to get his lighter.
- I'm not doing that.

503
01:01:46.362 --> 01:01:48.322
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

504
01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:50.032
Come on, be reasonable.

505
01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.203
There's got to be another way,
or someone else who can do it.

506
01:01:54.497 --> 01:01:57.000
He's your client.

507
01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.919
Yeah, but what if I screw it up?

508
01:02:00.547 --> 01:02:01.714
You can do this.

509
01:02:03.383 --> 01:02:07.554
Well, he keeps it here, you know.
In his breast pocket.

510
01:02:07.722 --> 01:02:11.392
So then you do the good old
kiss-the-neck...

511
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.103
rub-his-chest...

512
01:02:13.271 --> 01:02:14.521
reach in...

513
01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.106
and bam...

514
01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.984
you're gold.

515
01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.988
Yeah.

516
01:02:21.156 --> 01:02:22.990
Kiss the neck.

517
01:02:23.241 --> 01:02:25.160
- He'll like that.
- Heh, heh.

518
01:02:25.703 --> 01:02:27.787
Don't part with your illusions.

519
01:02:27.955 --> 01:02:32.793
When they are gone, you may still exist,
but you will cease to live.

520
01:02:32.962 --> 01:02:36.256
Who said that? Mark Twain.

521
01:02:36.508 --> 01:02:40.094
Wise man.
You are going to be fine tonight.

522
01:02:40.471 --> 01:02:41.972
All right.

523
01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.766
Now...

524
01:02:44.476 --> 01:02:46.228
showtime.

525
01:04:05.869 --> 01:04:08.663
Gentlemen. Welcome.

526
01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:13.919
We have a new girl for you tonight.
Something extra special.

527
01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:16.965
It is a work-in-progress...

528
01:04:17.133 --> 01:04:21.888
so I apologize in advance
for the raw nature of the performance.

529
01:04:22.056 --> 01:04:23.515
I will say, however...

530
01:04:24.225 --> 01:04:27.187
that is part of the charm.

531
01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:30.691
It is my pleasure to introduce to you...

532
01:04:31.276 --> 01:04:33.611
this little baby doll.

533
01:05:16.582 --> 01:05:18.458
Okay. This is how it's gonna go.

534
01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:21.129
Amber will keep the bird on station.

535
01:05:21.296 --> 01:05:24.633
Blondie, you'll operate the 50 cal here
and the 30 down there.

536
01:05:26.052 --> 01:05:31.099
The rest of you, drop into the courtyard
and kill the creatures in your way.

537
01:05:31.267 --> 01:05:35.564
Now, when you reach the nest,
you'll find the baby.

538
01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:37.482
You'll have to slit its throat.

539
01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:41.487
Down inside its neck are two crystals...

540
01:05:41.655 --> 01:05:46.869
that, when struck together, produce
the most magnificent fire you'll ever see.

541
01:05:49.165 --> 01:05:50.331
Amber...

542
01:05:50.833 --> 01:05:52.126
put us on approach.

543
01:05:52.294 --> 01:05:55.171
Roger that. Starting my run.

544
01:06:16.199 --> 01:06:17.407
Nice.

545
01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:20.203
Remember:

546
01:06:20.537 --> 01:06:24.040
Don't ever write a check with your mouth
you can't cash with your ass.

547
01:06:25.084 --> 01:06:27.503
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.

548
01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:30.924
Don't wake the mother.

549
01:06:50.866 --> 01:06:52.075
<i>Here we go, ladies.</i>

550
01:06:53.245 --> 01:06:57.833
Go! Go! Go!

551
01:07:10.224 --> 01:07:11.933
Go!

552
01:07:15.105 --> 01:07:16.522
Up!

553
01:07:17.817 --> 01:07:19.359
Go!

554
01:07:24.324 --> 01:07:25.826
Up!

555
01:09:35.113 --> 01:09:36.363
Whoa!

556
01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:36.037
<i>I got an idea.</i>

557
01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.164
Hold on!

558
01:13:58.858 --> 01:14:00.359
I got you now!

559
01:14:06.158 --> 01:14:08.035
Take that, you ugly mother.

560
01:14:11.374 --> 01:14:12.749
Amber, where is she?

561
01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:14.417
<i>Check our 6. I don't see her.</i>

562
01:14:20.885 --> 01:14:23.763
<i>Blondie, keep your eyes peeled.</i>

563
01:14:45.833 --> 01:14:47.876
I'll kill yo...

564
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:56.679
<i>She's all yours, Baby.</i>

565
01:16:29.546 --> 01:16:31.004
I can't believe I did it.

566
01:16:31.172 --> 01:16:33.132
Damn, that girl can dance.

567
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.552
See what you can do?

568
01:16:36.262 --> 01:16:38.514
Wow, Amber.

569
01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.766
Check it out.

570
01:16:41.644 --> 01:16:42.894
- Halfway home.
- Yeah.

571
01:16:43.062 --> 01:16:44.479
Let me see it.

572
01:16:47.484 --> 01:16:48.901
- It's just like I said:
- Oh.

573
01:16:49.069 --> 01:16:51.989
You kiss the neck, it works every time.

574
01:16:53.325 --> 01:16:55.702
- Good job.
- How'd we do?

575
01:16:56.537 --> 01:16:58.998
Nice. Here.

576
01:17:00.584 --> 01:17:03.503
- And he didn't even notice.
- No. No idea.

577
01:17:11.723 --> 01:17:13.432
Good work, Amber.

578
01:17:14.685 --> 01:17:16.185
- Thanks, Baby.
- Cheers.

579
01:17:16.353 --> 01:17:18.689
- Cheers.
- Cheers?

580
01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:20.733
What are we celebrating?

581
01:17:21.192 --> 01:17:22.277
Huh?

582
01:17:23.279 --> 01:17:25.155
Who should I be congratulating?

583
01:17:25.323 --> 01:17:28.034
It was just Babydoll's first time
on stage.

584
01:17:28.201 --> 01:17:29.702
You know how scary that can be.

585
01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:31.538
Yeah.

586
01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:34.125
The bond of the theater.

587
01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:37.086
Hm?

588
01:17:38.048 --> 01:17:40.215
I mean, what else could it be?

589
01:17:42.845 --> 01:17:46.974
I mean, it's not like any of you
have anything to hide, is it?

590
01:17:47.351 --> 01:17:48.559
No.

591
01:17:48.894 --> 01:17:51.396
It's not like anyone was in my office...

592
01:17:52.023 --> 01:17:54.525
messing with my shit.

593
01:17:55.235 --> 01:17:58.656
No. It's not like people
are missing things.

594
01:17:58.823 --> 01:18:02.744
You know, small little objects
here and there.

595
01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:07.750
No. No, that would be outrageous.
That would be crazy.

596
01:18:07.918 --> 01:18:09.085
Right?

597
01:18:09.252 --> 01:18:13.715
Because we have such an obvious
explanation for this exuberance.

598
01:18:13.883 --> 01:18:16.386
It's the fraternity of performers.

599
01:18:16.553 --> 01:18:21.475
It's the adrenaline from
the curtain rising.

600
01:18:23.396 --> 01:18:24.688
Maybe this is my fault.

601
01:18:24.855 --> 01:18:28.275
You know, maybe I've just become
too familiar with you girls.

602
01:18:28.443 --> 01:18:30.611
Maybe I need to make an example
of someone.

603
01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:34.199
Re-establish the parameters
of our relationship. What do you think?

604
01:18:34.367 --> 01:18:37.161
Blondie, girls?

605
01:18:40.875 --> 01:18:42.543
And what about you?

606
01:18:43.129 --> 01:18:44.462
Huh?

607
01:18:45.464 --> 01:18:47.216
Oh.

608
01:18:48.343 --> 01:18:50.052
You think you're special, don't you?

609
01:18:51.097 --> 01:18:54.349
Well, I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

610
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:59.690
If I was not about to make a small fortune
on you with the High Roller...

611
01:19:01.818 --> 01:19:07.115
I would take you right now
and I would pop that little smile...

612
01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:09.493
right off of your face.

613
01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:17.628
It saddens me that I have to
resort to threats with you girls.

614
01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:19.757
I thought we were past that.

615
01:19:20.508 --> 01:19:24.137
I just... I need this bullshit to stop!

616
01:19:25.681 --> 01:19:27.808
Out of mutual respect.

617
01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:32.606
Let's get things back to how they were.

618
01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.830
Well...

619
01:19:48.043 --> 01:19:49.710
So much for that little experiment.

620
01:19:52.548 --> 01:19:53.632
What are you saying?

621
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.550
I'm saying it's over.

622
01:19:56.386 --> 01:19:58.137
Right, Baby?

623
01:19:58.889 --> 01:19:59.931
I don't know.

624
01:20:00.433 --> 01:20:02.267
What do you mean, you don't know?

625
01:20:03.228 --> 01:20:04.437
Blue's onto us.

626
01:20:04.772 --> 01:20:05.897
We had a deal.

627
01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:08.275
If I say it's over, it's over.

628
01:20:08.443 --> 01:20:10.611
We're this close, though.
We can't just stop.

629
01:20:10.779 --> 01:20:14.741
Did you not hear Blue?
He knows we're up to something.

630
01:20:14.909 --> 01:20:16.159
He knows what we're doing.

631
01:20:16.328 --> 01:20:19.580
If he catches us for real,
it won't be a lecture. You saw him.

632
01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:23.585
Sweet Pea. Rocket is right.
The High Roller comes tomorrow.

633
01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:27.173
- If we can just stick with the plan till then...
- No! You're screwed.

634
01:20:29.803 --> 01:20:31.428
We're out.

635
01:20:33.516 --> 01:20:34.766
Rocket...

636
01:20:36.227 --> 01:20:37.478
we're out.

637
01:20:39.064 --> 01:20:40.774
I'm finishing this.

638
01:20:41.693 --> 01:20:43.694
We are all finishing this.

639
01:20:43.862 --> 01:20:47.031
You know it's the only way
we can get out of here.

640
01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:53.123
You're gonna choose her...

641
01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:56.126
someone you barely know...

642
01:20:56.294 --> 01:20:58.045
over me?

643
01:20:58.338 --> 01:21:00.506
After all I've sacrificed for you.

644
01:21:03.386 --> 01:21:04.803
I'm sorry.

645
01:21:50.654 --> 01:21:51.904
Blondie?

646
01:21:52.072 --> 01:21:54.699
What are you doing down there?
Are you all right?

647
01:21:54.867 --> 01:21:56.076
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

648
01:21:56.243 --> 01:21:58.454
What? What's wrong?
Did someone hurt you?

649
01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:02.376
- No, it's not like that. It's really nothing.
- Clearly...

650
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:05.045
it is not nothing.

651
01:22:06.048 --> 01:22:07.465
Hey.

652
01:22:08.384 --> 01:22:12.137
You can tell me. I am good listener.

653
01:22:13.139 --> 01:22:15.058
Madame Gorski...

654
01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:16.851
please.

655
01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:18.896
I know that look.

656
01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:23.026
You think you're all alone,
and that no one can help you.

657
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:26.364
There is a way to fix anything.

658
01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:28.658
Now...

659
01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:31.662
tell me what is wrong, child.

660
01:22:35.418 --> 01:22:36.459
Okay.

661
01:22:39.506 --> 01:22:41.549
Promise you can keep a secret?

662
01:22:41.717 --> 01:22:43.218
- Yes.
- Yes.

663
01:23:02.284 --> 01:23:04.494
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know.

664
01:23:04.662 --> 01:23:06.748
We need your music.

665
01:23:09.293 --> 01:23:13.756
You know what, forget it.
No, it's too late. Sweet Pea was right.

666
01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:18.011
What are you talking about?
The three of us, we can...

667
01:23:18.179 --> 01:23:19.805
I don't think we can do this.

668
01:23:20.682 --> 01:23:24.144
I don't wanna do something stupid
that's gonna put you guys in danger.

669
01:23:25.104 --> 01:23:26.146
I'm sorry.

670
01:23:28.358 --> 01:23:30.526
Hey, we got this far, right?

671
01:23:30.736 --> 01:23:33.530
I mean, that's something
not a lot of people could have done.

672
01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.787
How bad can the High Roller be,
anyway?

673
01:23:45.129 --> 01:23:48.341
Don't you girls have some work
you should be doing?

674
01:23:49.551 --> 01:23:51.177
- You came to help us.
- No.

675
01:23:52.263 --> 01:23:54.306
I came to keep you
from getting killed.

676
01:23:54.808 --> 01:23:55.934
Thank you.

677
01:23:56.102 --> 01:23:57.644
We don't have a lot of time.

678
01:23:57.812 --> 01:24:00.731
If you're done with the pleasantries,
you got a dance to do.

679
01:24:00.899 --> 01:24:03.568
Amber, radio.

680
01:24:29.685 --> 01:24:31.854
What the hell are you doing?

681
01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:50.209
You're gonna wanna watch this.

682
01:25:04.186 --> 01:25:05.729

690
01:25:39.897 --> 01:25:43.943
Ladies, this is what's on
our dance card for tonight.

691
01:25:44.110 --> 01:25:48.073
The bomb, code-named "Kitchen Knife,"
is on a hijacked train.

692
01:25:48.241 --> 01:25:51.077
It is protected by a couple dozen
mechanized gunmen.

693
01:25:51.662 --> 01:25:52.870
The idea is simple:

694
01:25:53.039 --> 01:25:57.835
Take care of the gunmen,
deactivate the bomb, then steal it.

695
01:25:58.003 --> 01:26:02.341
The code numbers for the bomb and the jet
packs for your escape are in that duffel.

696
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:03.842
Got it.

697
01:26:04.177 --> 01:26:06.054
Sweet Pea.

698
01:26:06.222 --> 01:26:08.348
I'm glad you changed your mind.

699
01:26:14.774 --> 01:26:17.359
Well, there you have it.

700
01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:21.490
You know, for those who fight for it...

701
01:26:21.658 --> 01:26:26.079
life has a flavor the sheltered
will never know.

702
01:26:26.622 --> 01:26:29.541
Oh, yeah. One last thing.

703
01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:34.131
The bomb's timer is set to detonate
when it reaches the city.

704
01:26:34.299 --> 01:26:38.428
So if I were you, I'd hurry!

705
01:27:15.224 --> 01:27:16.391
Weapons hot, ladies.

706
01:27:17.268 --> 01:27:18.311
Hot.

707
01:27:18.479 --> 01:27:20.229
- Hot.
- Hot.

708
01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:29.616
I've got a lock.

709
01:27:40.047 --> 01:27:41.381
Good luck.

710
01:27:54.022 --> 01:27:56.650
- We're down.
- Copy that.

Whoa!

721
01:31:33.003 --> 01:31:36.673
Hurry, Amber.
We gotta get this thing out of here.

722
01:31:37.008 --> 01:31:38.551

727
01:32:07.672 --> 01:32:09.339
<i>Guys, it's caught on something.</i>

728
01:32:09.966 --> 01:32:12.760

Whoa!

737
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:53.844
- Rocket, let's go.
<i>- Warning:</i>

<i>Weapon will activate in 25 seconds.</i>

739

It's broke. It's not gonna work.

740
01:34:00.019 --> 01:34:02.313
I'm on full burn. We'll go together.

741
01:34:02.481 --> 01:34:04.441
It's not gonna carry the both of us.

742
01:34:04.609 --> 01:34:07.361
- We have to try.
- Okay, we'll try.

743
01:34:07.529 --> 01:34:09.531
But you've gotta promise me two things.

744
01:34:09.699 --> 01:34:11.116
Rocket, let's go.

745
01:34:11.284 --> 01:34:14.120
- The first thing is...
- <i>Weapon will activate in 15 seconds.</i>

746
01:34:14.288 --> 01:34:15.621
don't get mad about this.

747
01:34:15.789 --> 01:34:17.457
About what?

748
01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:20.420
This.

749
01:34:23.507 --> 01:34:25.175
Rocket!

750
01:34:38.026 --> 01:34:42.947
<i>Weapon will activate in 10, nine...</i>

751
01:34:43.115 --> 01:34:47.911
<i>eight, seven, six...</i>

752
01:34:48.079 --> 01:34:51.207
<i>five, four...</i>

753
01:34:51.375 --> 01:34:56.130
<i>three, two, one.</i>

754
01:35:32.718 --> 01:35:34.261
The second thing is...

755
01:35:37.057 --> 01:35:38.892
when you get home...

756
01:35:41.062 --> 01:35:42.563
when you get free...

757
01:35:46.069 --> 01:35:48.612
you tell Mom I love her.

758
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:52.701
- I'll tell her.
- Mom.

759
01:35:52.868 --> 01:35:54.495
I promise.

760
01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:14.145
Oh, my.

761
01:36:14.312 --> 01:36:17.982
You, what did you do?
You simple, inbred idiot.

762
01:36:18.151 --> 01:36:20.444
Sir, don't know what happened. I just...

763
01:36:20.611 --> 01:36:22.447
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

764
01:36:22.614 --> 01:36:24.949
Get her up. Get her up, CJ!

765
01:36:27.287 --> 01:36:28.996
Yes. Yeah, look.

766
01:36:29.164 --> 01:36:31.207
I want you to look at what you did.

767
01:36:31.375 --> 01:36:34.545
Look at what you did, you bitch!

768
01:36:35.297 --> 01:36:36.630
Amber, sweetheart.

769
01:36:36.798 --> 01:36:40.218
You've got Sweet Pea's slot
in tonight's show. Go get ready.

770
01:36:41.637 --> 01:36:44.807
Go get ready.

771
01:36:46.226 --> 01:36:47.561
Go!

772
01:36:50.566 --> 01:36:52.650
Take her to the closet.

773
01:36:56.865 --> 01:36:58.909
As for you...

774
01:37:01.162 --> 01:37:02.204
it's showtime.

775
01:37:22.271 --> 01:37:26.150
The High Roller is here.
I need you to focus for me.

776
01:37:26.318 --> 01:37:28.445
Ah. Thank you.

777
01:37:30.824 --> 01:37:32.242
Girls?

778
01:37:32.409 --> 01:37:37.373
Can you just gather around for a second?
I wanna say a few words.

779
01:37:39.293 --> 01:37:42.337
That's all right.
You can just finish getting her dressed.

780
01:37:42.964 --> 01:37:45.258
Okay. There we go.

781
01:37:45.425 --> 01:37:47.260
Very nice.

782
01:37:48.972 --> 01:37:50.556
All right.

783
01:37:53.060 --> 01:37:56.939
I try to give you all...

784
01:37:57.607 --> 01:37:59.233
a good life.

785
01:38:00.152 --> 01:38:02.612
I try. I do.

786
01:38:03.574 --> 01:38:07.243
And all I ask for in return is just for...

787
01:38:07.745 --> 01:38:09.413
respect...

788
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:12.125
honesty.

789
01:38:12.293 --> 01:38:14.043
You know... Oh, that's okay, Margaret.

790
01:38:14.211 --> 01:38:17.131
A give-and-take relationship.

791
01:38:17.757 --> 01:38:20.594
But it's come to my attention...
It's come to our attention...

792
01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:24.140
that a few bad eggs...

793
01:38:24.308 --> 01:38:26.225
led by one little egg in particular...

794
01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:31.523
have spit in the face
of that generosity...

795
01:38:31.691 --> 01:38:35.445
and are plotting against me.

796
01:38:36.239 --> 01:38:37.698
Me.

797
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:40.201
Your father.

798
01:38:41.037 --> 01:38:42.787
Your lover.

799
01:38:43.539 --> 01:38:45.875
Your employer.

800
01:38:47.419 --> 01:38:51.048
Plotting to take from me
my most precious possessions.

801
01:38:51.215 --> 01:38:52.383
Your very selves.

802
01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:53.927
Blue, what you doing?

803
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:57.640
- Hm?
- You got the information. You have won.

804
01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.852
This little fantasy of freedom
is all they have.

805
01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:06.484
No, no, no. No one's buying that,
honey. No one's buying that, Vera.

806
01:39:07.444 --> 01:39:10.864
There is nothing you can do to me
that you haven't already done.

807
01:39:11.074 --> 01:39:14.327
- Unh.
- You listen to me, you old whore.

808
01:39:14.495 --> 01:39:19.166
It's too late to play the good guy.
It's far too late.

809
01:39:19.334 --> 01:39:23.630
You're suddenly not aware
of what it is we do here?

810
01:39:23.798 --> 01:39:28.887
I teach them to survive you.

811
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:34.894
- All right.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean to say anything.

812
01:39:35.062 --> 01:39:36.104
I'm sorry.

813
01:39:36.271 --> 01:39:37.940
No, Blondie.

814
01:39:38.108 --> 01:39:40.359
I didn't mean to.

815
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:42.278
He said everything would be okay.

816
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:45.324
Blue, this is a mistake.

817
01:39:45.492 --> 01:39:46.867
Please don't do this, okay?

818
01:39:47.035 --> 01:39:50.747
That's right.
Our dear Blondie came to us...

819
01:39:50.915 --> 01:39:54.293
desperately trying to help her sisters
off this most dangerous path.

820
01:39:54.461 --> 01:39:56.295
At first, we didn't even believe her.

821
01:39:56.463 --> 01:40:01.553
But after hearing who was involved,
frankly, it started to make sense.

822
01:40:02.138 --> 01:40:04.222
- Right here?
- Blue.

823
01:40:06.727 --> 01:40:09.855
Uh-huh. "Map. Fire."

824
01:40:11.733 --> 01:40:16.237
Looks like that chicken was counted
a little before it hatched.

825
01:40:17.741 --> 01:40:19.992
Ain't that right, Amber?

826
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:26.292
You have anything to say? Anything?

827
01:40:27.335 --> 01:40:30.297
Blue, we didn't... We were still...

828
01:40:30.465 --> 01:40:32.090
You know what, sweetheart?

829
01:40:32.258 --> 01:40:33.801
It's okay.

830
01:40:34.219 --> 01:40:35.762
It's okay.

831
01:40:39.476 --> 01:40:40.517
No!

832
01:40:40.685 --> 01:40:42.312
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, calm down.

833
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.192
This will all be over soon
and we can get back to business as usual.

834
01:40:46.359 --> 01:40:48.944
Blondie, I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

835
01:40:49.112 --> 01:40:50.405
I am so sorry.

836
01:40:50.573 --> 01:40:53.784
The thing is, we hate snitches, so...

837
01:40:57.331 --> 01:40:58.874
No!

838
01:41:04.173 --> 01:41:06.383
Okay. Here.

839
01:41:06.551 --> 01:41:08.094
I hate guns.

840
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:10.972
I hope everyone's learned
a valuable lesson here.

841
01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:15.061
Especially you, Madame Gorski.
Get her out of here.

842
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:17.313
Let's get these bodies out of here, please.

843
01:41:17.564 --> 01:41:21.026
And the rest of you, you got a show to do.
So go on, go get them, girls.

844
01:41:21.194 --> 01:41:23.113
Make it count.

845
01:41:39.175 --> 01:41:41.635
I've been thinking a lot...

846
01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:46.391
about all that money
you're gonna make me.

847
01:41:46.893 --> 01:41:50.897
I've been thinking a lot about the
High Roller and his hands all over you.

848
01:41:51.065 --> 01:41:54.401
I've been thinking about
all those people out there...

849
01:41:55.445 --> 01:41:57.655
just watching you
and lusting after you.

850
01:41:57.823 --> 01:41:59.783
And you'd think that would
give me pleasure.

851
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:03.037
I mean, I'm in the business of pleasure.

852
01:42:03.998 --> 01:42:06.291
But you know what
it makes me feel like?

853
01:42:06.458 --> 01:42:10.421
I'm gonna be honest with you. It
makes me feel like I'm this little boy...

854
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:12.716
sitting in the corner of the sandbox...

855
01:42:12.884 --> 01:42:16.429
while everybody
gets to play with my toys...

856
01:42:17.848 --> 01:42:19.308
but me.

857
01:42:20.226 --> 01:42:21.727
So you know what I'm gonna do?

858
01:42:22.478 --> 01:42:25.857
I'm gonna take my toys
and I'm gonna go home.

859
01:42:28.236 --> 01:42:30.905
I'm going home now...
Oh, that's good! That's it.

860
01:42:31.114 --> 01:42:33.491
Oh, is that it?!
That's my little bitch.

861
01:42:36.914 --> 01:42:38.372
This what you like?

862
01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:40.375
Come here!

863
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:43.588
What? No, no, no.

864
01:42:43.756 --> 01:42:46.216
Come on. Come on!

865
01:42:47.051 --> 01:42:50.095
Did you lose your fight? Huh?

866
01:42:50.639 --> 01:42:52.015
No.

867
01:42:53.726 --> 01:42:54.935
I just found it.

868
01:43:06.533 --> 01:43:08.577
You'll never have me.

869
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.080
Ever.

870
01:43:11.331 --> 01:43:12.331
Ever.

871
01:43:20.468 --> 01:43:22.928
- Sweet Pea.
- Where's Amber and Blondie?

872
01:43:23.846 --> 01:43:25.181
It's just us now.

873
01:43:26.308 --> 01:43:28.811
We have to go, Sweet Pea. Come on.

874
01:44:07.026 --> 01:44:08.526
- That's it.
- Okay.

875
01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:35.852
- Now what?
- Wait for it.

876
01:44:46.742 --> 01:44:48.076
<i>Come on.</i>

877
01:45:11.356 --> 01:45:12.940
Damn it.

878
01:45:14.401 --> 01:45:16.069
This can't be.

879
01:45:16.612 --> 01:45:17.905
We did everything right.

880
01:45:18.782 --> 01:45:23.286
A map, fire, a knife, a key,
and one thing more.

881
01:45:23.788 --> 01:45:25.247
One thing more.

882
01:45:30.588 --> 01:45:32.131
It's me.

883
01:45:32.632 --> 01:45:34.092
What?

884
01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:37.053
Oh, it's me. Of course it's me.

885
01:45:37.721 --> 01:45:40.057
It's the only way
this ever could have ended.

886
01:45:40.225 --> 01:45:41.809
What do you mean?

887
01:45:45.148 --> 01:45:46.649
I'm saying you go home.

888
01:45:47.484 --> 01:45:49.569
Go home to your family.

889
01:45:50.488 --> 01:45:52.948
You tell your mom what Rocket said.

890
01:45:53.199 --> 01:45:54.993
Make her happy.

891
01:45:56.662 --> 01:45:58.956
Go out and live a normal life...

892
01:45:59.166 --> 01:46:00.624
love...

893
01:46:01.168 --> 01:46:02.752
be free.

894
01:46:04.172 --> 01:46:06.256
You have to live for all of us now.

895
01:46:06.758 --> 01:46:09.969
- Baby, no. You can't do that.
- Yes, Sweet Pea.

896
01:46:10.137 --> 01:46:12.014
You're the strongest.

897
01:46:12.182 --> 01:46:15.185
You're the only one of us
that ever had a chance out there.

898
01:46:15.352 --> 01:46:17.812
You going home and living,
that's how we win.

899
01:46:18.397 --> 01:46:20.858
It's okay. It's okay. It's better this way.

900
01:46:23.029 --> 01:46:24.571
Now listen.

901
01:46:25.281 --> 01:46:26.991
I'm gonna walk out there...

902
01:46:28.035 --> 01:46:30.786
and when they come after me,
you go, okay?

903
01:46:31.539 --> 01:46:33.248
There's gotta be another way.

904
01:46:34.042 --> 01:46:35.501
No.

905
01:46:36.670 --> 01:46:38.213
This is right.

906
01:46:41.176 --> 01:46:43.345
This was never my story.

907
01:46:44.138 --> 01:46:45.680
It's yours.

908
01:46:46.098 --> 01:46:47.850
Now, don't screw it up, okay?

909
01:46:53.024 --> 01:46:55.902
You stay off the roads
and you find a bus station, all right?

910
01:46:57.071 --> 01:46:58.780
You're gonna be fine.

911
01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.647
Where you going, sweetheart?

912
01:47:36.412 --> 01:47:39.497
I said, where you going?

913
01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:41.950
There you are.

914
01:48:43.078 --> 01:48:45.455
You gave us quite a scare, you know?

915
01:48:47.291 --> 01:48:48.792
Where am I?

916
01:48:49.211 --> 01:48:51.879
You're safe for now.

917
01:48:54.717 --> 01:48:59.347
I don't know how to put this delicately so I
will spare you the insult of being vague...

918
01:49:00.891 --> 01:49:03.310
that you and I are supposed
to screw.

919
01:49:04.187 --> 01:49:06.731
I hope you'll forgive my language...

920
01:49:06.899 --> 01:49:10.236
but I think you'll find it is in keeping
with the spirit of the arrangement.

921
01:49:10.946 --> 01:49:15.951
Now I have absolutely no intention
of simply taking you.

922
01:49:17.036 --> 01:49:18.454
In fact...

923
01:49:19.623 --> 01:49:21.375
I can think of nothing more offensive.

924
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:26.005
You see, I am what you might call
a man who has everything.

925
01:49:26.882 --> 01:49:31.929
And yet, I lack the one thing
money can't buy.

926
01:49:33.432 --> 01:49:36.101
- Love?
- Close.

927
01:49:37.061 --> 01:49:38.438
Truth...

928
01:49:39.106 --> 01:49:40.440
is more accurate.

929
01:49:43.069 --> 01:49:47.490
I seek a true moment,
a moment of truth.

930
01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:49.785
In this...

931
01:49:50.745 --> 01:49:52.580
world of lies.

932
01:49:54.375 --> 01:49:57.127
It just so happens that...

933
01:49:57.295 --> 01:49:59.505
that moment...

934
01:49:59.673 --> 01:50:04.428
that fragile, delicate thing
like a glass egg...

935
01:50:04.596 --> 01:50:09.225
or a sand castle,
well, that moment...

936
01:50:09.727 --> 01:50:13.647
can only be given
by a non-faker.

937
01:50:15.234 --> 01:50:16.902
A non-actor.

938
01:50:17.778 --> 01:50:19.363
That's you.

939
01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.824
I don't understand.

940
01:50:23.703 --> 01:50:25.913
Well, I have spent...

941
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:29.709
a small fortune
getting you in this room.

942
01:50:30.462 --> 01:50:32.796
This golden cage.

943
01:50:35.092 --> 01:50:39.055
You're supposed to give yourself to me.

944
01:50:40.182 --> 01:50:41.933
It's completely physical.

945
01:50:42.977 --> 01:50:46.773
I might have your body...

946
01:50:46.941 --> 01:50:49.025
but the real you that...

947
01:50:50.402 --> 01:50:54.699
intangible, and indefinable spark
that is you.

948
01:50:56.744 --> 01:50:58.955
Well, that you I will never know.

949
01:51:01.166 --> 01:51:03.544
And, yet, that is precisely what I want.

950
01:51:11.763 --> 01:51:13.389
I'm sorry.

951
01:51:15.226 --> 01:51:16.893
You seem really nice.

952
01:51:19.064 --> 01:51:21.065
You want me to lie to you?

953
01:51:21.692 --> 01:51:23.735
No, I don't.

954
01:51:24.404 --> 01:51:26.697
All I require from you...

955
01:51:27.575 --> 01:51:29.701
is a sliver of a moment.

956
01:51:31.413 --> 01:51:33.622
To have you not by force...

957
01:51:34.916 --> 01:51:37.419
but simply as a man and a woman.

958
01:51:39.923 --> 01:51:43.760
To see in your eyes
that simple truth...

959
01:51:45.013 --> 01:51:47.180
that you give yourself to me freely.

960
01:51:48.058 --> 01:51:50.268
Not because you have to...

961
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:53.063
but because you want to.

962
01:51:55.776 --> 01:51:59.571
Now, of course, you're such a gem...

963
01:52:01.742 --> 01:52:03.451
I will give as well.

964
01:52:06.289 --> 01:52:08.291
I'm willing to give you freedom.

965
01:52:10.461 --> 01:52:12.796
Pure and total freedom.

966
01:52:13.173 --> 01:52:15.799
Freedom from the drudgery
of every day life...

967
01:52:17.178 --> 01:52:21.390
freedom as abstract ideal.

968
01:52:22.893 --> 01:52:24.770
Freedom from pain...

969
01:52:27.482 --> 01:52:29.817
freedom from responsibility...

970
01:52:32.197 --> 01:52:34.073
freedom from guilt...

971
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.535
from regret...

972
01:52:39.538 --> 01:52:41.374
freedom from sadness...

973
01:52:43.919 --> 01:52:46.046
freedom from loss...

974
01:52:49.635 --> 01:52:51.678
the freedom to be happy.

975
01:53:02.192 --> 01:53:04.026
Don't close your eyes.

976
01:53:05.488 --> 01:53:07.114
I need you to look at me.

977
01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:13.455
The freedom to love.

978
01:53:34.441 --> 01:53:36.066
Jesus.

979
01:53:40.906 --> 01:53:42.324
Did...?

980
01:53:43.326 --> 01:53:45.537
Did you see the way she looked at me?

981
01:53:47.582 --> 01:53:50.835
Just in that last moment. It was like...

982
01:53:59.597 --> 01:54:01.055
Doctor?

983
01:54:01.391 --> 01:54:02.433
Is it done?

984
01:54:02.601 --> 01:54:06.354
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

985
01:54:06.522 --> 01:54:09.149
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

986
01:54:09.317 --> 01:54:12.612
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

987
01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:16.658
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

988
01:54:16.826 --> 01:54:17.952
Poor child.

989
01:54:18.913 --> 01:54:23.834
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

990
01:54:24.002 --> 01:54:26.546
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

991
01:54:26.714 --> 01:54:28.465
Oh, I'm afraid not.

992
01:54:28.633 --> 01:54:30.968
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

993
01:54:31.136 --> 01:54:36.016
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

994
01:54:36.184 --> 01:54:38.812
and helped another patient to escape.

995
01:54:41.106 --> 01:54:43.651
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

996
01:54:43.819 --> 01:54:47.656
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

997
01:54:47.824 --> 01:54:49.157
Well, I...

998
01:54:53.163 --> 01:54:54.998
That is your signature, is it not?

999
01:54:55.625 --> 01:54:58.503
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

1000
01:54:58.671 --> 01:55:02.341
and to be honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

1001
01:55:02.509 --> 01:55:06.972
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

1002
01:55:07.139 --> 01:55:08.348
But this one...

1003
01:55:09.267 --> 01:55:11.352
Something in her eyes.

1004
01:55:11.687 --> 01:55:13.938
I've never seen anyone that...

1005
01:55:14.858 --> 01:55:16.859
It's the way she looked at me.

1006
01:55:17.026 --> 01:55:19.237
It's like she wanted me to do it.

1007
01:55:23.952 --> 01:55:25.369
I hope it helps her.

1008
01:56:08.799 --> 01:56:10.425
Hi.

1009
01:56:13.889 --> 01:56:15.599
You remember me?

1010
01:56:16.601 --> 01:56:20.063
Listen. Listen, I got a bad feeling, okay?

1011
01:56:20.230 --> 01:56:21.439
These boys do too.

1012
01:56:22.483 --> 01:56:24.526
This is not the way
we should be running this place.

1013
01:56:24.694 --> 01:56:26.820
We don't run the place. I run it.

1014
01:56:26.988 --> 01:56:28.823
In the chair.

1015
01:56:31.118 --> 01:56:32.453
Look...

1016
01:56:34.122 --> 01:56:35.456
I'm not...

1017
01:56:36.209 --> 01:56:39.294
- I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
- I'm not doing this.

1018
01:56:39.462 --> 01:56:42.715
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

1019
01:56:42.883 --> 01:56:44.635
I need her in that chair.

1020
01:56:46.513 --> 01:56:49.307
Put her in the goddamn chair!

1021
01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:53.980
Thank you.

1022
01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:59.528
Close the door, please.

1023
01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.457
What? What is it, you're not here? Huh?

1024
01:57:09.625 --> 01:57:13.587
You're not here, you're in paradise?
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1025
01:57:13.755 --> 01:57:15.464
No, no, no.

1026
01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:20.012
You're still here.

1027
01:57:20.347 --> 01:57:22.515
You're here with me.

1028
01:57:24.059 --> 01:57:26.020
In all this shit.

1029
01:57:27.188 --> 01:57:30.025
And you don't go away unless I say so.

1030
01:57:30.776 --> 01:57:32.193
Okay?

1031
01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:47.713
That's not right.

1032
01:57:48.173 --> 01:57:50.133
That's not right.

1033
01:57:50.551 --> 01:57:51.843
Come back.

1034
01:57:57.060 --> 01:57:59.519
No! No!

1035
01:57:59.687 --> 01:58:01.564
I said you don't go!

1036
01:58:02.316 --> 01:58:04.442
You come back to me.

1037
01:58:07.572 --> 01:58:10.408
- Stop right there. Move away from the girl.
- What are you doing?

1038
01:58:10.576 --> 01:58:13.746
Aah! Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Aah!

1039
01:58:13.914 --> 01:58:15.915
What in God's name
have you been doing up here?

1040
01:58:16.083 --> 01:58:18.752
I wasn't doing anything. Look at her.

1041
01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.339
She's gone. Look at her face!
She's not here.

1042
01:58:21.507 --> 01:58:24.550
What do you think I wanna do?
I take care of these girls.

1043
01:58:24.718 --> 01:58:27.262
I look out for them.
These are my girls. Tell them.

1044
01:58:28.097 --> 01:58:29.849
Tell them!

1045
01:58:30.017 --> 01:58:31.434
Get him out of here.

1046
01:58:31.602 --> 01:58:35.105
- Now.
- Aah! Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Wait.

1047
01:58:35.273 --> 01:58:37.526
It's not me you want, it's her stepfather.

1048
01:58:37.693 --> 01:58:41.405
I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you...
I'll tell you about the money.

1049
01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:43.991
Just keep going down the hall.

1050
01:58:45.202 --> 01:58:46.954
You all right, miss?

1051
01:58:51.168 --> 01:58:52.627
Miss?

1052
01:59:03.392 --> 01:59:07.521
<i>And finally, this question:</i>

1053
01:59:07.981 --> 01:59:11.276
<i>The mystery of whose story it will be...</i>

1054
01:59:11.735 --> 01:59:14.196
<i>of who draws the curtain.</i>

1055
01:59:15.031 --> 01:59:18.535
<i>Who is it that chooses our steps
in the dance?</i>

1056
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:21.663
<i>Who drives us mad...</i>

1057
01:59:22.207 --> 01:59:23.583
<i>lashes us with whips...</i>

1058
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:27.838
<i>and crowns us with victory
when we survive the impossible?</i>

1059
01:59:28.798 --> 01:59:30.258
<i>Who is it...</i>

1060
01:59:31.427 --> 01:59:33.928
<i>that does all these things?</i>

1061
01:59:35.432 --> 01:59:38.810
<i>Bus 22 southbound
to Fort Wayne will now begin loading.</i>

1062
01:59:38.978 --> 01:59:42.063
<i>Please have your tickets ready
to show the driver.</i>

1063
01:59:56.875 --> 01:59:58.125
Excuse me, miss?

1064
02:00:02.381 --> 02:00:04.216
Miss, can we have a word?

1065
02:00:04.468 --> 02:00:06.845
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

1066
02:00:07.013 --> 02:00:09.806
This doesn't concern you.
I have questions for the lady.

1067
02:00:09.974 --> 02:00:12.810
Well, could you make it snappy?
I need to stay on schedule.

1068
02:00:12.978 --> 02:00:14.855
- We understand.
- Do you?

1069
02:00:15.023 --> 02:00:17.524
That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

1070
02:00:17.692 --> 02:00:21.905
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

1071
02:00:22.073 --> 02:00:23.240
Is that true, miss?

1072
02:00:23.408 --> 02:00:27.245
I just let her off to use the restroom.
Mine's not working.

1073
02:00:30.917 --> 02:00:34.337
- All right.
- Oh, and one more thing.

1074
02:00:34.922 --> 02:00:38.759
- She's been a joy the entire journey.
- Yes, I said, all right.

1075
02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:44.684
Sorry about the inconvenience, miss.
You have yourself a nice trip now.

1076
02:00:44.851 --> 02:00:46.185
It's no problem.

1077
02:00:56.157 --> 02:00:59.744
- I don't have a ticket.
- I know. It's okay.

1078
02:00:59.912 --> 02:01:03.373
Go find a seat in the back.
Try and get some sleep.

1079
02:01:04.084 --> 02:01:06.460
We got a long way to go.

1080
02:01:08.006 --> 02:01:09.256
Thank you.

1081
02:01:17.308 --> 02:01:21.146
<i>Who honors those we love
with the very life we live?</i>

1082
02:01:22.148 --> 02:01:24.900
<i>Who sends monsters to kill us...</i>

1083
02:01:25.318 --> 02:01:28.947
<i>and at the same time
sings that we'll never die?</i>

1084
02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:34.912
<i>Who teaches us what's real
and how to laugh at lies?</i>

1085
02:01:35.831 --> 02:01:39.961
<i>Who decides why we live
and what we'll die to defend?</i>

1086
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:42.589
<i>Who chains us?</i>

1087
02:01:42.798 --> 02:01:46.302
<i>And who holds the key
that can set us free?</i>

1088
02:01:48.181 --> 02:01:49.681
<i>It's you.</i>

1089
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:52.935
<i>You have all the weapons you need.</i>

1090
02:01:53.103 --> 02:01:54.145
<i>Now fight.</i>
