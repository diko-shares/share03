1
00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:03,464
Mr. Beaumont, why would you hire me

2
00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,882
if you knew who my mother was?

3
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:06,484
The question isn't why I hired you.

4
00:00:06,486 --> 00:00:07,852
It's why you'd want to work for the man

5
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:09,320
who got her killed.

6
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:12,990
Damien Delaine

7
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:14,559
wanted to become a martyr that day,

8
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,195
and he will never forgive me.

9
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:18,396
Never.

10
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,813
Didn't you promise Evie

11
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,014
you wouldn't track her anymore?

12
00:00:23,016 --> 00:00:24,682
It's for her own safety.

13
00:00:24,684 --> 00:00:26,818
She's your daughter.
You have to trust her.

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,453
- I'm back.
- Hello, sweetie.

15
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,254
You gate-crashing our shopping trip?

16
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:32,824
- Your mom's caught me working again.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,125
This isn't over, Maxine.

18
00:00:34,127 --> 00:00:35,259
It is over.

19
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,463
Delaine lost.

20
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:38,083
He's not gonna accept defeat.

21
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,767
- Eric.
- Nathalie, what's wrong?

22
00:00:41,769 --> 00:00:44,335
I put Evie on the plane
back to Montreal myself.

23
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:46,137
The driver's waiting at arrivals.

24
00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:47,305
She never showed.

25
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,040
I know something's wrong, Eric.

26
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,911
Delaine's taken my daughter.

27
00:00:59,303 --> 00:01:01,303
_

28
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:06,654
_

29
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,611
You're Eric Beaumont?

30
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:28,980
- That's right.
- He disabled the elevator.

31
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:30,515
Oh, great.

32
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,246
He says he'll jump if we go out there.

33
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,871
He'll jump if we don't.

34
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,214
Okay.

35
00:01:56,342 --> 00:01:58,109
Mr. Faber?

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,415
You don't want to do this, Mr. Faber.

37
00:02:11,658 --> 00:02:14,458
- I said no cops.
- See, I'm not a cop.

38
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,060
My name's Eric Beaumont.

39
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm a negotiator.

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,097
I got nothing to negotiate.

41
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,365
My life is over.

42
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:23,067
That is not true. I just ran eight blocks

43
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,335
from your work. I talked to your boss.

44
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:26,296
He says he's gonna find you another job.

45
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:30,074
- You're lying.
- I don't lie, Jacob.

46
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,977
That voice in your head,

47
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,514
the one telling you to give up?

48
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,216
Don't listen.

49
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:40,051
Sorry.

50
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:43,387
I just can't.

51
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:48,059
Go, go.

52
00:02:52,332 --> 00:02:54,131
Come on.

53
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:57,401
Let go.

54
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm not gonna do that.

55
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,679
I'll take you with me.

56
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,449
I can't leave your son without a father.

57
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,885
And he needs you.

58
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:01,183
That was really brave, Mr. Beaumont.

59
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,901
Nathalie Denard.

60
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,504
My company insures this hotel.

61
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,641
That a-a French accent?

62
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,122
I'm from Paris.

63
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:14,178
People really eat snails over there?

64
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,280
And we talk like this, and...

65
00:04:16,282 --> 00:04:18,316
- Make great fries, though, right?
- Mmm.

66
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:19,731
You're ex-FBI?

67
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,519
Yeah, I just started my own firm.

68
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,774
Um, Crisis Resolution.

69
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:25,240
Must be good at reading people.

70
00:04:25,242 --> 00:04:27,342
Absolutely, the best.
I'm reading you right now,

71
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:29,377
- as a matter of fact. Mm-hmm.
- Are you?

72
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:30,941
You're wondering if I

73
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,048
- find you attractive.
- Oh.

74
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,183
- How are you getting that?
- Microexpressions,

75
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:37,452
voice latency, the way the vein
in your neck is throbbing.

76
00:04:37,454 --> 00:04:39,521
But mostly because I'm thinking that,

77
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:41,389
and I thought it would
be nice if that's what...

78
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,991
you were also thinking.

79
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,823
_

80
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,750
I never should have left Evie

81
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,886
to fly home without me.
You couldn't know.

82
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:12,888
If I had just stayed with her,
she wouldn't be kidnapped.

83
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,623
Hey, hey. Neither of us
knew this would happen.

84
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,658
You can't blame yourself, okay?

85
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,827
We got something.

86
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:29,571
CCTV footage from the airport
seven hours ago.

87
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:32,240
It's Damien Delaine
posing as her limo driver.

88
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,310
That's proof that he violated his parole.

89
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,479
And Delaine never said
anything to you about this?

90
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,414
You think I wouldn't have told you that?

91
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:44,753
She didn't even know that
she was being kidnapped.

92
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,190
Well, she knows now.

93
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,558
What's he done with her?

94
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:02,437
Crisis Resolution.

95
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,848
Maxine.

96
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,941
Lovely to hear your voice.

97
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,777
We know you took Evie, Damien.

98
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,146
Of course I did.

99
00:06:11,148 --> 00:06:14,816
I've just sent proof she's alive
to Mr. Yates.

100
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,022
Evie.

101
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:22,691
I will negotiate with Eric

102
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:24,025
and only Eric.

103
00:06:24,027 --> 00:06:26,795
Breathe a word of this to the police,

104
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,864
and the girl dies.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,067
Oh, baby.

106
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:33,768
At least he's willing to negotiate.

107
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,136
Eric.

108
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:37,205
He doesn't care about Evie.

109
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,608
She's just a way to get what he wants.

110
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,109
Which is what?

111
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:44,212
Damien Delaine wants to destroy Eric.

112
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:46,414
He won't stop until he has.

113
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:20,293
Delaine skirted CCTV

114
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,227
at the airport.

115
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,729
There's no way to track his vehicle

116
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:24,464
- without the police.
- And he said no police.

117
00:07:24,466 --> 00:07:26,032
Well, maybe we should call them anyway.

118
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,301
We do that, we'll never see Evie again.

119
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,103
Delaine doesn't bluff.

120
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:32,305
There must be something we can do.

121
00:07:32,307 --> 00:07:33,740
Zara stayed behind in Virginia

122
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:35,642
to see if Delaine dropped
any bread crumbs.

123
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:37,143
Mobile phones, credit cards...

124
00:07:37,145 --> 00:07:39,212
Well, the man is a master
of digital manipulation.

125
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,647
He'll have covered his tracks.

126
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,615
- She's checking anyway.
- Profile's up.

127
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,369
We know Delaine's profile.

128
00:07:45,806 --> 00:07:48,521
This is our protocol, Eric, remember?

129
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:49,989
We don't need to talk. We need to act.

130
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,257
He has taken my daughter.

131
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,893
All the more reason
to follow the protocol.

132
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:01,631
Go ahead.

133
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,272
Delaine was an outspoken critic

134
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,274
of digital technology.

135
00:08:08,276 --> 00:08:09,716
Back in 2000, he argued

136
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,442
that the world would be
taken over by the Internet,

137
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,247
robbing people
of their privacy and freedom.

138
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,682
This is what the cult at Shiloh

139
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:18,218
was trying to stop
until the FBI moved in.

140
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,522
37 people were killed,

141
00:08:22,524 --> 00:08:23,957
including...

142
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,391
Maxine's mother.

143
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,400
Delaine was released last week

144
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:37,237
on parole after serving
17 years in prison.

145
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:39,339
Well, he wasted no time coming after you.

146
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,940
Well, not directly.

147
00:08:40,942 --> 00:08:42,275
Not at first.

148
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:43,943
He brainwashed a former student,

149
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:45,278
Victoria Locke,

150
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,413
with the aim to destroy Eric

151
00:08:47,415 --> 00:08:49,382
by tricking him into killing her.

152
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:50,683
He thought Maxine would turn
against us when she learned

153
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:52,852
that Eric killed her
mother, but she didn't.

154
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,957
I know you were just doing
what you had to do.

155
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,626
I don't blame you.

156
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:02,395
So taking Evie was what?

157
00:09:02,397 --> 00:09:04,197
A backup plan
because his trick didn't work?

158
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,165
Possibly.

159
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,566
If it was improvised,

160
00:09:06,568 --> 00:09:07,500
maybe he made a mistake.

161
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,469
Delaine doesn't make mistakes.

162
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,672
Like Maxine said, he won't stop
until he destroys me.

163
00:09:12,674 --> 00:09:15,475
Which is why this is a toxic negotiation.

164
00:09:15,477 --> 00:09:16,674
Why toxic?

165
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,245
Eric's perspective will be blurred

166
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,347
because he's negotiating
for the life of a loved one.

167
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:23,183
He should recuse himself,

168
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:24,517
but since Delaine insists

169
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,219
on negotiating with him,

170
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,921
he's gonna need a whisperer.

171
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:30,256
- A shadow.
- I'll monitor his every decision,

172
00:09:30,258 --> 00:09:31,302
make sure he doesn't act out

173
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,050
- of emotion.
- No, no, Maxine.

174
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:36,429
This is toxic for you, too,

175
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,144
given his history with your mother.

176
00:09:38,973 --> 00:09:40,740
Oliver will be my whisperer.

177
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,611
Hello, Cri/Res.

178
00:09:53,835 --> 00:09:55,535
Okay.

179
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,291
It's Delaine. He's downstairs.

180
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:03,142
He wants to come up.

181
00:10:18,173 --> 00:10:19,602
Mr. Yates.

182
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:23,176
Very nice place you have, Eric.

183
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,745
Must have made a lot of money
off other people's misery

184
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:28,848
while I was rotting in jail.

185
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,284
You'll rot there again soon enough.

186
00:10:31,286 --> 00:10:32,907
You think?

187
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,690
You're very lovely, Nathalie.

188
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,693
I can see why Eric prizes you so much.

189
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:43,062
I know you think I'm a
monster, but believe me,

190
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:46,299
any evil I've done is nothing
compared to your husband.

191
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:47,678
Evil?

192
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,331
He prevented my martyrdom

193
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,170
and brought about the world we live in.

194
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,939
And what world is that?

195
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,700
Endless cyber warfare,

196
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:58,437
digital chaos, people addicted

197
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,999
to their devices,

198
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,632
entertaining themselves to death,

199
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:04,802
while corporations and
government monitor and control

200
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,571
the way we vote and think.

201
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,873
I should make a martyr of you right now.

202
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,209
And never see your daughter
again? I don't think so.

203
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,544
You are a monster.

204
00:11:13,546 --> 00:11:15,212
You tried to get me to betray Eric

205
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:17,214
by twisting the truth about my mother.

206
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:20,417
You disappointed me in the end, Maxine.

207
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:22,519
Just like she did.

208
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,788
- Go to hell, Damien.
- What do you want?

209
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:28,125
To talk, of course.

210
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,173
That's what you people
are good at, isn't it?

211
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:32,663
We're listening.

212
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:35,099
I'm gonna ask some questions.

213
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:37,334
If you fail to answer truthfully,

214
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,269
the girl dies.

215
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,972
What kind of questions?

216
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:43,707
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Yates.

217
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:46,810
Eric won't need a whisperer for this.

218
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:00,724
It's difficult getting the truth

219
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:03,694
from a silver-tongued liar
like yourself, Eric.

220
00:12:03,696 --> 00:12:05,929
Hurt Evie, and I break your neck.

221
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:08,298
How's that for truth?

222
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,467
Such violence.

223
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,936
Are you ready, Mr. Yates?

224
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:14,138
Ready.

225
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,307
First, the obvious question.

226
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:20,644
You admit to being in love
with Maxine's mother,

227
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,646
Jessica Ford?

228
00:12:22,648 --> 00:12:23,981
I admit it.

229
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:28,385
And despite the official FBI account,

230
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,387
you confess to killing her

231
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,955
in cold blood?

232
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,991
To stop her from detonating

233
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:35,959
an explosive vest, yes.

234
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:37,861
I ask the questions, Eric.

235
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:40,130
You answer yes or no.

236
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:42,132
Yes, I killed her.

237
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,334
Though I wish I would have killed you.

238
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,636
Go ahead,

239
00:12:45,638 --> 00:12:47,771
check your graph.

240
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,408
On to happier topics. There's a member

241
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,678
of your team that I've often
wondered about... Zara Hallam.

242
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:57,014
What about her?

243
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:58,582
She's so loyal.

244
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:01,218
Working endless hours,
traveling the world with you,

245
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,320
while her husband
and children languish at home.

246
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:05,355
Her relationship with you strikes me

247
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:08,358
- as more than professional.
- You don't have to listen to this.

248
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,660
He can't hurt me.

249
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:10,827
Your pretty wife has no idea,

250
00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:13,797
but you two have slept together,
have you not?

251
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,834
No.

252
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,744
Go figure.

253
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,414
Oliver Yates.

254
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,616
He told you he wants you to give him

255
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,518
his own team.

256
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,852
Did you tell him that?

257
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:37,554
Yeah.

258
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,223
Yes, he did.

259
00:13:39,225 --> 00:13:41,058
You said you'd consider it.

260
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,493
But you have no intention
of doing so, do you?

261
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,530
No, I don't.

262
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:51,735
I'm fine.

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,274
One more question, Eric.

264
00:13:57,276 --> 00:13:59,810
And remember, no lying.

265
00:14:01,146 --> 00:14:03,547
The risks you take saving lives,

266
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,784
most people see it as heroism,
but we know it's not.

267
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,201
Do we?

268
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,188
You're racked with guilt
over Jessica's death.

269
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,835
You're blazing with self-loathing.

270
00:14:12,837 --> 00:14:14,308
You dare not kill yourself,

271
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,926
but if someone was to take your life

272
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:18,662
in the line of duty, that would be...

273
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,397
a relief.

274
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:23,600
That's why you're always
so happy to play the hero.

275
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:25,102
Always the hero.

276
00:14:25,104 --> 00:14:26,937
Isn't that right, Eric?

277
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,379
I don't know.

278
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:42,019
You don't know?

279
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:45,952
Well, maybe now you do.

280
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,307
Follow me or have me tracked,
and you'll never find her.

281
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,027
- He's answered your questions.
- Tell us where she is.

282
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,434
I've got three wishes.

283
00:14:57,436 --> 00:14:59,836
Answering the questions was my first.

284
00:14:59,838 --> 00:15:01,467
What are the others?

285
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:05,542
I have a plane to catch at 1:30 tomorrow.

286
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,344
I'm seeing my parole officer in New York.

287
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:08,378
Grant my wishes

288
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,280
by then, she lives.

289
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:11,481
What are they?

290
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:13,383
All in good time.

291
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,888
You really are very lovely, Nathalie.

292
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,846
She's scared and alone.

293
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,748
Knowing that psychopath

294
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,150
- could kill her at any moment.
- You'll stop him.

295
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,719
You're smarter than he is.

296
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:07,320
Am I?

297
00:16:07,322 --> 00:16:09,689
Delaine's a genius.

298
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:15,895
He preys on people's
weaknesses to hurt them.

299
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,932
Whatever your demons are,

300
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,900
you're a good man, Eric.

301
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,103
You still believe in me.

302
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,472
I always will.

303
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:28,932
What?

304
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,435
You said Delaine preys
on people's weaknesses.

305
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,882
How did he know ours?

306
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:39,953
Sit rep?

307
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:42,389
Intonation and latency
are flat, colorless.

308
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,990
Delaine gave us nothing.

309
00:16:43,992 --> 00:16:45,358
Except the questions he asked.

310
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,160
His questions were
insightful and required

311
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:49,763
intimate knowledge of my
relationships with each of you.

312
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,364
How did he get that knowledge?

313
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,366
By compromising our computer systems,

314
00:16:53,368 --> 00:16:56,369
accessing our confidential
e-mails and personal records.

315
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:59,105
That would be consistent with
his expertise with computers.

316
00:16:59,107 --> 00:17:00,874
But he wouldn't have had access

317
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:03,728
- to computers in prison.
- His pal Victoria Locke would have.

318
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,381
I can check. If there's a breach

319
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:06,980
in the files,
I should be able to locate it.

320
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:09,482
- And how would that help us?
- Well, Delaine is a game player.

321
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:11,217
Right now he's holding
all the cards... we need

322
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,752
someone who can help us improve our odds.

323
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:13,887
Someone like Victoria Locke.

324
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:15,021
Well, Delaine brainwashed

325
00:17:15,023 --> 00:17:16,456
Victoria Locke for over a decade.

326
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,024
She's not being brainwashed now.

327
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,726
Yeah, but she was institutionalized

328
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:20,994
in Virginia yesterday.

329
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,029
Deprogramming her could take weeks,

330
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:24,297
months even.

331
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,899
We only have...

332
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,101
12 hours until Delaine's deadline.

333
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,590
I'll call Zara.
She can try talking to her.

334
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,405
Nathalie?

335
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:34,507
Delaine wants to destroy you,

336
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,676
and he won't stop until he has.

337
00:17:36,678 --> 00:17:38,645
So why not just kill Evie, then?

338
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,780
What's worse than that?

339
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:06,072
Please don't fear me, Evie.

340
00:18:06,946 --> 00:18:08,741
I just want to help you.

341
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:12,178
I've got nothing to say to you.

342
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:16,416
Your father prepared you
for an event like this.

343
00:18:16,418 --> 00:18:18,751
He would have told you to stay calm,

344
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:22,822
not to engage with your kidnapper.

345
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,461
Oh, Evie, you just...

346
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,563
want to go home, don't you?

347
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,832
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

348
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,501
Evie,

349
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,806
where is home?

350
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:40,061
You're in boarding school
ten months out of the year,

351
00:18:41,145 --> 00:18:44,677
while your parents gallivant
across the world.

352
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,813
My parents are working.

353
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:47,881
Yes.

354
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,682
Yes, they are.

355
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:51,684
But...

356
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:54,020
you're their only child, Evie.

357
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,244
Shouldn't you come first?

358
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:02,662
I never had any children.

359
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:06,432
Your father put me in prison,
so I never led a normal life.

360
00:19:06,434 --> 00:19:08,201
You should still be there.

361
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,737
Perhaps.

362
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:14,941
But I paid for my crimes.

363
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:17,210
And your father didn't.

364
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:21,477
Evie...

365
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:24,851
I took the SIM card out.

366
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,719
But...

367
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:29,389
there's still music and games.

368
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,453
_

369
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,893
Hey, Max.

370
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,628
Hey. You're at St. Agatha's?

371
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,796
Yeah. I just got here.

372
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:11,364
I'm on my way to see Victoria now.

373
00:20:11,366 --> 00:20:12,932
Everything okay?

374
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,667
Listen, Zara, I...

375
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,336
I need to apologize.

376
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,804
For what?

377
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:20,106
I lied when I said
I hadn't been in contact

378
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,241
- with Damien Delaine.
- You thought Delaine could answer

379
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:23,910
questions about your mother.

380
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:25,745
I just... want you to know

381
00:20:25,747 --> 00:20:29,115
that as soon as we find Evie,
I'm resigning.

382
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:32,352
Delaine thought he
could use you to destroy Eric,

383
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:35,822
and instead, you saved him...
you saved all of us.

384
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:38,825
- Ma'am?
- Look, you are like a sister to me.

385
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:41,661
Delaine is still out there, and
we need to stick together, Max.

386
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:43,529
Now more than ever.

387
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:45,298
Okay?

388
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,855
I'll call you as soon as I'm done.

389
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:58,077
She prefers to stay in the dark.

390
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,701
She thinks that way Delaine
won't be able to find her.

391
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,049
Victoria?

392
00:21:03,051 --> 00:21:04,951
Can you see me?

393
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:07,082
Yes.

394
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,390
Thank you for speaking with me.

395
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,191
Does he know you're here?

396
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:15,261
Damien Delaine? No.

397
00:21:15,263 --> 00:21:18,798
He sees everything, you know.

398
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,802
You might think you're safe,
but you're not, anywhere, ever.

399
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:25,171
You are safe, Victoria.

400
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,673
No one's gonna hurt you here.

401
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:29,008
He got inside my head.

402
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,106
But he is out of your head now.

403
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,880
And I need your help.

404
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:38,364
For what?

405
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,354
Delaine has kidnapped
Eric Beaumont's daughter.

406
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:44,190
Oh, no. No, no.

407
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:46,659
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Victoria.

408
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:49,529
No. It's my fault, you see?

409
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,464
He had me hack into your files.

410
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:53,232
If she's in danger, it's because of me.

411
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:56,199
If you can tell us anything,
anything at all.

412
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,871
Don't you see? He's going to kill me.

413
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:00,773
He's going to kill everyone.

414
00:22:00,775 --> 00:22:03,042
We are not gonna let that happen.

415
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:05,227
You can't stop him, no one can.

416
00:22:05,229 --> 00:22:07,513
I'm sorry. I-I don't know anything.

417
00:22:07,515 --> 00:22:09,716
Please, please go.

418
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:11,855
Victoria, I have come all this way.

419
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,455
Your colleague, Maxine,

420
00:22:15,457 --> 00:22:17,457
she was Jessica's daughter.

421
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:18,691
That's right.

422
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:21,527
Jessica had fire in her eyes.

423
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:23,596
And then Damien got inside her head,

424
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,298
just like he got inside mine.

425
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,334
He took her to hell and back.

426
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,471
You understand?

427
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,642
I hope you find Evie.

428
00:22:42,218 --> 00:22:43,751
I just spoke to Zara.

429
00:22:43,753 --> 00:22:45,119
She confirmed Victoria Locke

430
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,754
breached our firewall two months ago.

431
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,456
Without our even knowing it.

432
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,098
Pretty damn slick.

433
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,793
Delaine said digital technology
would become a weapon.

434
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:54,529
Now he's the one using it.

435
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,974
This is Eric.

436
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:08,976
Not even a “hello”?

437
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:11,185
Where are your manners?

438
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:14,315
Hello, Maxine, Mr. Yates, Ms. Denard.

439
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:15,616
Where is our daughter?

440
00:23:15,618 --> 00:23:16,933
First things first.

441
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,886
You wanted to know my second wish.

442
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:21,789
Eric will meet me at
2000 St. Alexander Street

443
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,024
in 30 minutes.

444
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,458
He'll come alone.

445
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,329
It's an office building.

446
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:32,500
Tenants include property
developers, investment brokers.

447
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,438
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

448
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:39,548
Except... Viktor Volynets.

449
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,941
A Russian oligarch,

450
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:43,077
immigrated from Moscow in 2014.

451
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,581
Assassinated dozens of his enemies.

452
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:51,552
What does a Russian
oligarch have to do with Damien Delaine?

453
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:52,753
You're not gonna play his game?

454
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,755
Send those files to my phone, will you?

455
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,346
I thought you might be hungry.

456
00:24:21,818 --> 00:24:24,051
It's my favorite.

457
00:24:24,053 --> 00:24:25,553
Who told you that?

458
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:28,033
The wonders of social media.

459
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,359
I am so sorry
I couldn't take you somewhere

460
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:34,862
more comfortable.

461
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:39,133
Still Daddy's good little girl.

462
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,509
Do you know who your father is?

463
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:51,212
I know he's a good man and you're not.

464
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:52,446
I'm sorry, Evie,

465
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:54,315
but your father is a narcissist

466
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:56,217
and a manipulator, who will say

467
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,786
and do anything to get what he wants.

468
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,088
The truth

469
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,525
is hard to hear; believe me, I know.

470
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:08,829
But the truth will set you free.

471
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,855
When am I getting out of here?!

472
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:17,305
Soon, Evie. Very soon.

473
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:27,648
Is that better?

474
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,843
_

475
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:21,335
I see you're wearing your button cam.

476
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:23,739
Hello, everyone.

477
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,073
When I was in prison,

478
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:30,511
they paid me $1.75
to make metal cabinets.

479
00:26:30,513 --> 00:26:33,881
Now that I'm a free man,
I find myself in need

480
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,384
- of more substantial remuneration.
- How much?

481
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,520
I don't want to be greedy,
but $100 million should do it.

482
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,822
Well, obviously, I don't
have anywhere near that.

483
00:26:41,824 --> 00:26:44,797
I know, Eric. I've seen
your finances, remember?

484
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,727
But you can get it.

485
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,029
From the oligarch.

486
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,832
Yeah. It seems crime does pay.

487
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:54,201
The murderous Mr. Volynets

488
00:26:54,203 --> 00:26:57,371
has assets in excess of $2 billion.

489
00:26:57,373 --> 00:27:00,141
This is a self-executing program.

490
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:01,976
Once inserted into the computer

491
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:03,844
in his private office,
it will transfer $100 million

492
00:27:03,846 --> 00:27:07,014
from his criminal activities
into my offshore accounts.

493
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,653
How do you expect me to get
into his private office?

494
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:14,054
Well, talking your way in
shouldn't be a problem

495
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:15,456
for a liar like you, Eric.

496
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:19,493
Look at it this way: if you die trying,

497
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:21,498
all your problems will be over.

498
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:24,293
But you better hurry.

499
00:27:25,168 --> 00:27:27,754
I have a flight to catch in two hours.

500
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:47,955
Eric, you can't do this.

501
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,223
Of course I can.

502
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,524
No. You'll be committing a felony.

503
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:51,926
Are you kidding me?

504
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:53,727
I won't live to face charges.

505
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:55,830
And $100 million to
a criminal psychopath.

506
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:57,498
What do you think Delaine's
gonna do with the money?

507
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,066
Well, I guess I'll just
have to wait and see.

508
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,302
Eric, you chose Oliver

509
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,703
as your whisperer for a reason.

510
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,941
I don't do this and Delaine kills Evie.

511
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:10,578
He's walking into a trap.

512
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,046
- We have to find Evie.
- Yeah, we're trying.

513
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,448
In 120 minutes, Delaine boards
a plane back to New York.

514
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,685
That's 120 minutes to save Evie and Eric.

515
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:32,819
Hi, Elena.

516
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:34,548
Mr. Volynets, please.

517
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:36,303
Do you have an appointment?

518
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,805
My name is Damien Delaine.

519
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,340
I was released
from federal prison last week,

520
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,542
and I have urgent information
for Mr. Volynets

521
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,410
regarding an FBI investigation.

522
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:45,346
What did you say your name was? Delaine.

523
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,481
D-E-L-A-I-N-E.

524
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:52,786
Mr. Volynets.

525
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:55,723
There's a gentleman here
that would like to see you.

526
00:28:57,427 --> 00:28:58,659
Damien Delaine.

527
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,534
You got any ideas, I'm all ears.

528
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,866
This is a negotiation, right?

529
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:08,035
One where Delaine calculated
every decision point

530
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,770
to make sure Eric does what he wants.

531
00:29:09,772 --> 00:29:11,472
Delaine always thinks ten steps ahead.

532
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,641
And every step is the right one.

533
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:15,009
What if it's not?

534
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:18,045
Right this way, Mr. Delaine.

535
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,647
Thank you so much, Elena.

536
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,582
Delaine knew we'd send Zara

537
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:23,450
to talk to Victoria Locke.

538
00:29:23,452 --> 00:29:25,419
But she didn't say anything to Zara.

539
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:26,954
- Maybe she did.
- Zara just got on a flight

540
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:28,289
out of Dulles an hour ago.

541
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:30,291
Can you play the recording she sent you?

542
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,867
Thank you so much, Elena.

543
00:29:42,772 --> 00:29:44,338
Mr. Delaine.

544
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,839
What's this about?

545
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:47,541
I just got out of Ossining, New York,

546
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:49,743
where I befriended
a former associate of yours,

547
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:51,545
Chokan Dushimov.

548
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,776
And what about him?

549
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,885
Chokan Dushimov has become
a federal informant.

550
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:59,887
- You're lying.
- The American government

551
00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:01,488
is building a case against you based

552
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,119
on his testimony, Mr. Volynets.

553
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,261
There's no evidence against me.

554
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,596
Oh, on the contrary.

555
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:13,000
Mr. Dushimov has names, numbers,

556
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:14,902
balances for all
of your offshore accounts,

557
00:30:14,904 --> 00:30:18,731
but he is willing to destroy them,

558
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,774
if you make it worth his while.

559
00:30:21,303 --> 00:30:23,410
You think you can shake me down?

560
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,648
A man's got to eat.

561
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:37,319
You'll need to get it decrypted.

562
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:41,095
Wait here.

563
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:43,909
Sure.

564
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:06,420
He sees everything, you know.

565
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:10,367
You might think you're safe,
but you're not, anywhere, ever.

566
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,965
You are safe, Victoria.

567
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,494
No one's gonna hurt you here.

568
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:14,928
Don't you see?

569
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,597
He's going to kill me.

570
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,065
He's going to kill everyone.

571
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,967
We are not gonna let that happen.

572
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:21,012
Oh, excuse me.

573
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:22,062
You can't stop it. No one can.

574
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:23,103
- I'm sorry.
- Hello.

575
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,371
I don't know anything.

576
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:26,607
Don't act surprised.

577
00:31:26,609 --> 00:31:29,043
Just walk away from the others.

578
00:31:31,847 --> 00:31:34,048
Okay.

579
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,253
What do you want?

580
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:41,055
My third wish.

581
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:44,758
You got to do exactly as I say,
lovely Nathalie, to the word,

582
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,529
or you'll never see your husband
or daughter again.

583
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:59,139
Delaine!

584
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,343
Open this door now!

585
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,773
Open this door now!

586
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,699
He took her to hell

587
00:32:14,701 --> 00:32:17,268
and back. You understand?

588
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,270
- Play it again.
- Which part?

589
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:20,704
- The whole thing.
- There's nothing there, Maxine.

590
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,508
We've missed something. I know it.

591
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:27,011
I'm going out for a smoke.

592
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:28,613
Thought you quit.

593
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,141
I did. I'll be back.

594
00:32:31,476 --> 00:32:33,251
He got inside my head.

595
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:34,719
I don't know how.

596
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,201
You, check the room.

597
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,434
He took her to hell and back.

598
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,538
You understand? I hope you find Evie.

599
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,807
That's five times, Max.

600
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:37,087
_

601
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,653
“To hell and back.”

602
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,131
Maybe she wasn't talking about
my mother when she said that.

603
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:49,327
She wanted to make sure
that we understood.

604
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:51,462
She was telling us where Delaine

605
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:52,864
took Evie.

606
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:55,934
She didn't mean “hell and back”"

607
00:33:55,936 --> 00:33:57,449
She meant “Hallenback”"

608
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,103
It's an abandoned power plant.

609
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:01,372
I'll call you from the car.

610
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,657
- I'm here.
- The place is abandoned.

611
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,526
You shouldn't have too much
trouble getting into it.

612
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:24,295
Just try to find an entrance somewhere.

613
00:34:52,392 --> 00:34:54,559
Nathalie?

614
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:56,244
Eric...

615
00:34:56,796 --> 00:34:58,963
What are you doing here?

616
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,626
Delaine's third wish.

617
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:15,246
Oliver, she could be anywhere.

618
00:35:15,248 --> 00:35:17,081
Pick a direction.

619
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,284
Okay, okay.

620
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:23,438
Evie?

621
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,626
Nathalie, it's gonna be okay.

622
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,895
It's gonna be okay.

623
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,667
Eric, what the hell is that?

624
00:35:35,669 --> 00:35:37,243
Eric, talk to me.

625
00:35:37,671 --> 00:35:39,370
Evie?

626
00:35:42,108 --> 00:35:43,975
Evie?!

627
00:35:51,705 --> 00:35:53,605
Give me to Eric.

628
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,178
He wants to talk to you.

629
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,792
Where are you?

630
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:03,094
I ask the questions and you answer.

631
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:04,604
Remember?

632
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,432
That's more like it.

633
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,485
Evie?

634
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,074
I got your money.

635
00:36:16,076 --> 00:36:17,275
You did, indeed.

636
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:19,277
And I'm prepared to release
your daughter,

637
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,278
as promised.

638
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,213
- Then you do it.
- Uh-uh.

639
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:23,881
Not so fast.

640
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,550
First, to say farewell,

641
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,219
I'll leave you
with what I believe you call

642
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:30,555
an oriented dilemma.

643
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:33,925
An impossible choice.

644
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,526
In plain English, yes.

645
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,195
Evie?

646
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,135
If I let you disarm Nathalie...

647
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:40,798
Evie?

648
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,667
...Evie dies.

649
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:43,974
Evie?!

650
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:46,637
If I release Evie,
then the lovely Nathalie

651
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,131
goes up in smoke,

652
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,174
just like poor Jessica.

653
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,710
You can save one or the other, Eric.

654
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,245
But not both.

655
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:56,748
 Evie?

656
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:01,278
- Max.
- Oliver, this place is huge.

657
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,388
- I'm still looking.
- Delaine's gonna kill either Nathalie

658
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,655
or Evie. Eric has to choose.

659
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,999
What?

660
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:09,427
Well, Eric, what's it gonna be?

661
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:11,729
Mother or daughter?

662
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:14,932
I am the one you want.

663
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,134
You just kill me.

664
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,335
It would be my pleasure,

665
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:19,837
but we established
you're not afraid to die.

666
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,340
In fact, it would be a relief.

667
00:37:22,342 --> 00:37:24,876
So why should I do you the favor?

668
00:37:24,878 --> 00:37:26,850
Let him kill me.

669
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:29,080
- Maxine, come on.
- Evie?

670
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:35,820
Evie.

671
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,224
Evie?

672
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,212
Evie, are you in there?

673
00:37:43,214 --> 00:37:44,620
Evie?

674
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,231
Evie, are you in there?!

675
00:37:55,312 --> 00:37:56,808
Got to move this along, Eric.

676
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,009
No.

677
00:37:58,011 --> 00:37:59,410
It's me you want.

678
00:37:59,412 --> 00:38:00,745
Count of ten.

679
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:02,280
Don't decide,

680
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,082
I kill 'em both. Ten,

681
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,117
nine,

682
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,820
eight,

683
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:10,421
- seven,
- I can't let Evie die for me.

684
00:38:10,423 --> 00:38:12,156
- Six,
- You have to let me die.

685
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,925
- Five...
- Please.

686
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:15,193
Five seconds, Maxine!

687
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,928
- ...four,
- Come on!

688
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,362
Three,

689
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,497
two,

690
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:20,498
and...

691
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:23,601
...one.

692
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:24,702
Evie!

693
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:26,370
- Time's up.
- Max.

694
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:28,072
- I need a decision.
- Oliver, I've got her.

695
00:38:28,074 --> 00:38:29,941
Eric, Max has got her.

696
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,876
She's got Evie. Wife or daughter, Eric?

697
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:33,544
Who's gonna live? Nathalie.

698
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:35,680
- I choose Nathalie.
- Eric, no!

699
00:38:35,682 --> 00:38:37,315
Pretty wife over pretty daughter.

700
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:38,583
Surprising.

701
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:39,817
She's safe.

702
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:41,050
Maxine's got her.

703
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,426
But then again,

704
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:45,306
you can always have another daughter.

705
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:52,463
Max?

706
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:54,465
Max?

707
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:56,934
We're fine. We're fine.

708
00:38:56,936 --> 00:39:00,004
Go.

709
00:39:38,645 --> 00:39:40,236
Thank you.

710
00:39:41,881 --> 00:39:43,681
Delaine?

711
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:46,717
He checked in with
his parole officer on schedule.

712
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,252
So that's it?

713
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:49,487
We just all

714
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,910
walk away like nothing happened?

715
00:39:50,912 --> 00:39:51,958
Well, Delaine lost.

716
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,155
If you consider $100 million losing.

717
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:56,427
He wanted a lot more than that.

718
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,862
He wanted to destroy Eric.

719
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,430
He won't stop trying.

720
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:00,565
He'll be watching us.

721
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,599
All of us.

722
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,428
And we'll be watching him.

723
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,335
I don't know how to thank you all.

724
00:40:05,337 --> 00:40:07,096
Yeah, neither of us do.

725
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:09,006
You just did.

726
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:20,885
Listen, I'm gonna drop both
of you back at the house,

727
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,279
and then I'll be leaving.

728
00:40:23,823 --> 00:40:25,356
Don't be silly.

729
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:27,158
At least stay the night.

730
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,361
Evie would like you to.

731
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,961
I can't.

732
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:31,537
I mean...

733
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:36,133
I can't be with you anymore.

734
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:37,468
With either of you.

735
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,469
It's not safe.

736
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:41,305
But Delaine could still come after us.

737
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:42,465
He won't.

738
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:45,443
Not if he thinks
he's driven me away from you.

739
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:50,994
You...

740
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:53,317
you wanted me to move on.

741
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:54,285
No.

742
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,320
Not like this.

743
00:40:56,322 --> 00:40:58,147
Hey.

744
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,395
I'm a mess.

745
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:06,397
Yeah.

746
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,299
A beautiful mess.

747
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,535
Let's go.

748
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:15,506
I could use a drink.

749
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:18,276
I'm not drinking, but I'll join you.

750
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,244
Yeah.

751
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:22,079
Sure. If you're buying.

752
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,465
Then you're staying.

753
00:41:25,718 --> 00:41:27,652
What are we talking about?

754
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:29,387
I...

755
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:32,456
I told Zara I was gonna resign
after all this was done.

756
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:33,958
Are you kidding me?

757
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,627
Listen, you even think about quitting,

758
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:39,130
you and I are gonna have
some serious problems.

759
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,666
I didn't know you cared.

760
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,534
Now you do.

761
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:50,775
One thing is still bothering me though.

762
00:41:50,777 --> 00:41:53,978
That a man like Delaine
could lose and walk away?

763
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,647
He told you he couldn't
violate his parole.

764
00:41:56,649 --> 00:41:59,583
Eric said Delaine's a game player.

765
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:02,461
What if the game isn't over?
