1
00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:44.057
How is it downstairs, Father?

2
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.061
As above, so below.

3
00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.567
Busy and bloody, my child.

4
00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.470
Just how I like it father.

5
00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:00.958
"Fifty year old well-hung bear

6
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.500
plays blank
to make you unload."

7
00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.844
- What's this game again?
- "Fill my hole."

8
00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:15.019
I read a blurb from the phone sex
line in this erotic literature.

9
00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:16.789
Phone sex line still exist?

10
00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:18.728
Yeah. I know.
It's so 80's.

11
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.601
So would you want
me to do again?

12
00:04:23.804 --> 00:04:25.172
Guess the missing word.

13
00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:27.879
"Filling my hole"
in the sentence?

14
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.514
And the joke works
on two levels.

15
00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:31.920
Barely works on one.

16
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.831
So?

17
00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:41.874
Well-hung bear plays...

18
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:46.650
Um... keytar?

19
00:04:55.768 --> 00:04:59.676
- A keytar?
- It's a keyboard you play like a guitar.

20
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:02.213
- That a euphemism.
- No, it's an instrument.

21
00:05:03.783 --> 00:05:06.589
- Why a keytar?
- Well, you said it was 80's.

22
00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:10.330
No... I feel like I'm chairing
an Alzheimer's Anonymous meeting

23
00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:12.956
surely that would just be
an Anonymous, Anonymous meeting.

Nigel, clear
the arena, pronto. Pronto.

67
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:36.508
Sorry, I had to get my bucket...

68
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:38.211
It's been a busy night.

69
00:08:38.244 --> 00:08:39.715
You've 20 bodies to cut and bag.

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:41.385

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:43.555

you're on glass duty.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.360
Jeremiah out.

73
00:08:45.393 --> 00:08:48.430
- But you said...
- Not now Nigel!

74
00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:04.063

Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, can you...?

77
00:09:47.549 --> 00:09:50.422
Just get her in there.
That's it. There she is.

78
00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:53.295
No, no. Hold on.

The blonde stays.

104
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:54.438
- Put the moose pig back in its cage.
- No.

105
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.079
"No," as my father taught me,

106
00:11:59.112 --> 00:12:01.084
is the last word
I hear from dead men.

107
00:12:01.117 --> 00:12:02.687
Yes, Mr. Requin.

108
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.159
No is a word I imagine
people want

109
00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:08.498
to say to you
a great deal, Junior.

110
00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:12.139
It's just you don't
want to hear it.

111
00:12:14.109 --> 00:12:16.881
No, I don't want to touch you.

112
00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:19.054
No.

113
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:22.527
Jeremiah's not a moose pig.

114
00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:24.496
How dare you?

115
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.733
How dare you??

116
00:12:27.837 --> 00:12:29.474
Listen carefully.

117
00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:32.612
You'll probably hear this
truth once from a woman.

118
00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:35.619
I'm only interested
in you for the money.

119
00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:38.858
Expendability
against expenditure.

120
00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:43.234
You give us disposable men
to fight to their deaths,

121
00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:45.706
I give you disposable income

122
00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:48.913
to pay for the women who'd
rather be dead than touch you.

123
00:12:52.852 --> 00:12:55.759
I can give men, women,
boys, and girls.

124
00:12:57.195 --> 00:12:58.931
I need fighting age men.

125
00:12:58.964 --> 00:13:00.702
Military background a plus

126
00:13:00.735 --> 00:13:03.242
and nobody who will miss
them when they're gone.

127
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.046
You have balls.

128
00:13:06.079 --> 00:13:08.117
Balls break. I don't.

129
00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:12.226
Your anonymity is guaranteed.

130
00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:15.729
Nobody knows the names of
the clients but me and my boss.

131
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:18.672
Nobody knows the password
to get to the names but me.

132
00:13:24.616 --> 00:13:25.719
Zero kills.

133
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.293
Hard Eight has
a code of conduct.

134
00:13:29.327 --> 00:13:31.864
How will a man who can't
kill on request,

135
00:13:31.897 --> 00:13:34.103
die on request? Hmm?

136
00:13:34.904 --> 00:13:36.241
We have leverage.

137
00:13:37.676 --> 00:13:39.847
He'll go down on the third.

138
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.685
If he lasts that long.

139
00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:45.024
Rawbone does not hold back.

140
00:13:45.057 --> 00:13:48.264
So Hard Eight has to cling
on for three long rounds.

141
00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:51.604
Where did you find Rawbone?

142
00:13:55.712 --> 00:13:57.283
My father.

143
00:13:57.316 --> 00:13:59.888
He won him in a game of cards
and loaned him to me.

144
00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:04.229
I told father I would bring
him back in one piece.

145
00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:07.035

You're a good man.

154
00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:47.268
Everything you do,
it's much appreciated, Nige.

155
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.274
Means a lot coming
from you, mate.

156
00:16:16.627 --> 00:16:19.868
Remember, down in the third.
Not before or after.

157
00:16:22.138 --> 00:16:23.574
I know that hurts you,

158
00:16:23.607 --> 00:16:25.579
you hate to lose.

159
00:16:25.612 --> 00:16:29.119

You hurt our business,
we hurt her.

Chrissy.

162
00:16:40.007 --> 00:16:42.144
We have eyes
and ears everywhere.

163
00:16:43.414 --> 00:16:46.421
In the beginning
I asked you a question.

164
00:16:46.453 --> 00:16:49.124
Is there anyone who would
miss you if you went missing?

165
00:16:49.157 --> 00:16:50.929
You said no.

166
00:16:52.698 --> 00:16:54.503
You made a decision to lie,

167
00:16:56.071 --> 00:16:58.344
and now you get to make
one last decision.

168
00:17:00.347 --> 00:17:01.617
You die...

169
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:03.721
or she dies.

170
00:17:52.217 --> 00:17:55.157
These names,
all people I killed.

171
00:17:56.494 --> 00:18:00.101
I have a place for
your name right here.

172
00:18:02.137 --> 00:18:03.541
Oh yeah,

173
00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:05.379
need me to spell it for you?

174
00:18:06.614 --> 00:18:09.251
Yeah!

175
00:18:31.764 --> 00:18:33.333
Don't kill the guests.

176
00:18:42.419 --> 00:18:44.890
Father Arkancide,
my lips to God's ears,

177
00:18:44.922 --> 00:18:46.661
Hard Eight dies by your hand.

178
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.731
Ow, you...

179
00:19:05.765 --> 00:19:07.834

Eight's secret call now, huh?

180
00:19:07.836 --> 00:19:09.607
Payback's a beautiful bitch.

181
00:19:09.639 --> 00:19:12.378
- Who is it?
- Police, open up.

182
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.747
We've heard reports of screams
coming from your flat.

183
00:19:14.749 --> 00:19:17.387
Screams? Haven't heard
any screams.

184
00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:19.994
- But you will.
- P-Please.

185
00:19:30.581 --> 00:19:33.420
Please don't.

186
00:19:33.453 --> 00:19:35.356
No, no, please.

187
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.861
Please don't shoot.

188
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:44.542
Is the bitch dead?

189
00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:50.755
All right. I thought
you were happy.

190
00:19:50.787 --> 00:19:52.492
No, I understand.
You're not happy.

191
00:19:53.961 --> 00:19:55.898
Hard Eight isn't getting past...

192
00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.571
What?

193
00:20:02.111 --> 00:20:05.351
We have men waiting for him.
Don't worry. I'll fix this.

194
00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:07.556
I love you.

195
00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.097
Mm-hmm, I want my money back.

196
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:14.569
Money I bet,
money I should have won.

197
00:20:14.603 --> 00:20:17.709
- Please, Mr. Requin...
- Shut your mouth.

198
00:20:17.742 --> 00:20:20.447
You made me break
my promise to my father

199
00:20:20.479 --> 00:20:22.484
that I would bring
him back in one piece.

200
00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:24.623
Well technically,
that's still true.

201
00:20:24.655 --> 00:20:26.927
I'll have to pay for a funeral.

202
00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:30.433
You know what a coffin
this size costs? Hmm?

203
00:20:30.467 --> 00:20:33.140
You steal my money,
you make me a liar.

204
00:20:33.173 --> 00:20:35.712
Give me one good reason why

205
00:20:35.744 --> 00:20:39.051
I shouldn't have Tick Tock here
rip your fucking heart out.

206
00:20:43.927 --> 00:20:45.163
There's two.

207
00:20:46.465 --> 00:20:47.835
My knees ache.

208
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.108
The cramps churn.

209
00:20:51.142 --> 00:20:53.480
I just want to crawl up
into a ball and...

210
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:56.620
Now you're getting it.

211
00:20:56.652 --> 00:20:58.690
The bleeding seems never-ending.

212
00:20:58.724 --> 00:21:02.899
The dull pain in the lower
back is constant.

213
00:21:02.932 --> 00:21:04.502
Every once in a while...

214
00:21:08.576 --> 00:21:10.615
Shooting pains.

215
00:21:11.983 --> 00:21:14.956
And the headaches,
brutal, right?

216
00:21:16.592 --> 00:21:20.034
I recommend a painkiller
and a good, long sleep.

217
00:21:26.746 --> 00:21:27.982
Sweet dreams.

218
00:21:33.827 --> 00:21:35.698
Now what do we do with you?

219
00:21:41.274 --> 00:21:42.711
Fuck.

220
00:21:42.744 --> 00:21:45.016
I'd like to reopen
the negotiations.

221
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:05.558
I know the business.

222
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:09.599
I know what you need.

223
00:22:11.301 --> 00:22:13.072
Settle your spurs a mo, cowboy.

224
00:22:17.949 --> 00:22:19.752
It's Hard Eight dead?

225
00:22:19.786 --> 00:22:22.224
No, but your boys are.

226
00:22:22.256 --> 00:22:24.060
And you'll be joining them soon.

227
00:22:24.093 --> 00:22:25.931
You shouldn't have
killed Chrissy.

228
00:22:26.866 --> 00:22:28.737
See you soon, Serena.

229
00:22:29.973 --> 00:22:31.776
Jeremiah, tell everybody
to be cocked,

230
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.680
locked and ready to rock.

231
00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:35.050
Hard Eight's on his way back.

232
00:22:36.384 --> 00:22:38.056
It's gonna be a fun night.

233
00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:03.472
Ass!

234
00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:06.846
Ugh, through the...

235
00:23:10.052 --> 00:23:12.692
Stop fucking jiggling.

236
00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:18.403
Muppet.

237
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.777
Now I can't sit in the front.

238
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.748
Win for me.

239
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.151
Nice, looks like we're
the first ones on the scene.

240
00:23:26.184 --> 00:23:27.789
How can we be here first?

241
00:23:27.821 --> 00:23:30.092
Redmond told us
to join her here.

242
00:23:30.126 --> 00:23:32.395
Hooper, I know you've
only been with us a month, mate.

243
00:23:32.397 --> 00:23:34.265
But if you're going to
go out in the field with me

244
00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:36.404
you have to expect
the unexpected, all right?

245
00:23:36.437 --> 00:23:40.146
Watch me. Soak in my experience.

246
00:23:40.179 --> 00:23:42.217
You'll go far in
this world, son.

247
00:23:42.249 --> 00:23:44.018
Your wife will have to sit
in the back now as well.

248
00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.824
Another win.

249
00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:47.424
Been married two years, Hooper,
you know what that means?

250
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.331
Third time lucky, she's the one.

251
00:23:49.363 --> 00:23:53.138
It means if I'm lucky, I get one
chance at sex once, once a week.

252
00:23:53.171 --> 00:23:55.811
Guess which night I get dragged
out on a last-minute raid?

253
00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:57.481
Tonight. Was your wife annoyed?

254
00:23:57.513 --> 00:23:59.886
I don't know. She's at her
cooking class tonight.

255
00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:08.268
All right Redmond?

256
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:10.239
This is a fucking raid,
you Muppets.

257
00:24:10.273 --> 00:24:12.544
Me and the SWAT unit are
parked on the corner,

258
00:24:12.576 --> 00:24:14.112
not realizing that
you two knobbers

259
00:24:14.114 --> 00:24:15.416
were announcing our arrival.

260
00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.987
Fucking move!

261
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.870
I liked her a lot better
before she quit smoking.

262
00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:28.307
Detective MacCready,
didn't hear you arrived.

263
00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:30.080
Comedy Bob, comedy.

264
00:24:30.112 --> 00:24:32.284
Right, on one we ran the door.

265
00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:34.588
Three, two, one.

266
00:24:35.925 --> 00:24:37.995
Three, two, one.

267
00:24:39.197 --> 00:24:40.499
One.

268
00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:42.570
One!

269
00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:44.275
Where's the fucking ram?

270
00:24:44.308 --> 00:24:46.244
We didn't bring the fucking ram.

271
00:24:46.278 --> 00:24:49.251
- You forgot the ram?
- We didn't bring the ram, Mam, Ma'am.

272
00:24:49.284 --> 00:24:51.589
- Ram mam.
- Stop saying fucking ram.

273
00:24:51.622 --> 00:24:54.127
We didn't bring the metal,
pushy, door-open device.

274
00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:56.165
- Just say ram.
- He said don't say ram.

275
00:24:56.197 --> 00:24:57.500
I'm ram you, you fucking...

276
00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:00.640
You didn't say you
had bolt cutters.

277
00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:03.045
You can ask for bolt cutters.
You asked for a ram.

278
00:25:03.078 --> 00:25:06.518
It's super specific man.
Ran the fucking door.

279
00:25:25.122 --> 00:25:28.362
There is CCTV, Redmond,
but it's fried.

280
00:25:28.395 --> 00:25:30.599
Need Hooper to
come work his magic.

281
00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:33.436
But before I can do that, he wants me
to come back up to the fifth floor.

282
00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:35.343
He thinks he's found something.

283
00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:45.195
Police! Please freeze!

284
00:25:45.228 --> 00:25:47.133
You have the right
to remain silent

285
00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:49.068
anything you say can
and will be used against

286
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.639
you in a court of law.

287
00:25:50.673 --> 00:25:52.610
Did you say "please freeze"?

288
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.431
I'll be back.

289
00:26:03.532 --> 00:26:04.635
Mug.

290
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:11.415
Not a word.

291
00:26:11.447 --> 00:26:13.549
And I need him talking before
Keaton hears about this raid.

292
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.255
The Chief Inspector's very late.

293
00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:17.158
- Oh, have you not seen the news tonight?
- No.

294
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.866
The mayor's given
her another award.

295
00:26:19.898 --> 00:26:22.603
- ...revered for her work.
- Woman of the year or some shit.

296
00:26:22.637 --> 00:26:26.378
Please be upstanding for
my old school friend.

297
00:26:26.411 --> 00:26:30.252
Woman of the Year, Chief
Inspector Katherine Keaton.

298
00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:31.756
I made an
important breakthrough.

299
00:26:32.756 --> 00:26:34.794
Hm, what's that on his arm?

300
00:26:38.736 --> 00:26:41.442
I know what that is.

301
00:26:41.474 --> 00:26:43.812
Saying nothing,
sometimes says the most.

302
00:26:44.949 --> 00:26:46.652
Hooper, in with me.

303
00:26:46.684 --> 00:26:48.522
Me, in? No. Why?

304
00:26:48.556 --> 00:26:49.558
I need a bad cop.

305
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.227
Am I a bad cop?

306
00:26:51.261 --> 00:26:53.166
Yes.

307
00:26:53.198 --> 00:26:55.382
- Redmond, grab me his evidence bag.
- Of course.

308
00:26:58.308 --> 00:27:01.215
This silence is gonna make you
a very popular boy on D Wing.

309
00:27:01.247 --> 00:27:02.617
What are you doing?

310
00:27:05.288 --> 00:27:07.493
You can see from his attempt
at interrogation

311
00:27:07.527 --> 00:27:10.465
my colleague is not here
to intimidate you physically.

312
00:27:10.499 --> 00:27:13.239
He cannot kick seven bells
of shit out of you.

313
00:27:13.272 --> 00:27:15.476
Not like I could.

314
00:27:15.508 --> 00:27:17.580
Not like they will inside.

315
00:27:17.614 --> 00:27:21.355
He won't outsmart you,
he has no wit, zero charm.

316
00:27:21.388 --> 00:27:23.426
He will never get
the girl at party.

317
00:27:23.458 --> 00:27:26.265
He will never get invited to
a party where there are girls.

318
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.973
What he understands
is computers.

319
00:27:31.274 --> 00:27:32.375
Loves 'em.

320
00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.020
He's going to retrieve
the footage that proves you

321
00:27:37.052 --> 00:27:38.922
created tonight's corpses.

322
00:27:38.956 --> 00:27:40.958
Actually that's what
I came in to tell you, Mac.

323
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.634
I've recovered fragments
of the CCTV feed.

324
00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:45.971
Bro.

325
00:27:48.708 --> 00:27:49.809
What's with all the banging?

326
00:27:49.811 --> 00:27:51.748
I'm being the bad cop.

327
00:27:51.782 --> 00:27:53.319
At least you're consistent.

328
00:27:54.653 --> 00:27:55.957
Just trying to...

329
00:28:14.661 --> 00:28:16.765
- Congratulations, Ma'am.
- Fuck off.

330
00:28:16.798 --> 00:28:18.735
Why didn't you call me?

331
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:20.440
I was taking initiative, ma'am.

332
00:28:20.473 --> 00:28:22.844
You're taking
the piss, Sergeant.

333
00:28:22.876 --> 00:28:24.580
Give me the run down.

334
00:28:24.614 --> 00:28:26.518
A 999 call gave us the address,

335
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.052
the place we've
been searching for.

336
00:28:28.054 --> 00:28:30.025
By the time we got there,
everyone was dead.

337
00:28:30.058 --> 00:28:31.661
All except one.

338
00:28:31.695 --> 00:28:33.933
No name, no prints
in the system.

339
00:28:33.966 --> 00:28:36.438
- Just carrying a door key and...
- Who called it in?

340
00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:38.676
A Serena Marcos.

341
00:28:38.708 --> 00:28:40.679
Serena Marcos?

342
00:28:40.712 --> 00:28:41.948
She here too?

343
00:28:43.484 --> 00:28:45.589
Not yet, but we're
still sifting bodies.

344
00:28:49.197 --> 00:28:50.833
Walk with me.

345
00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:56.878
I brought numb
nuts in here to show you,

346
00:28:56.911 --> 00:28:59.733
I'm not worried about getting you to talk.
I don't need you to.

347
00:29:00.952 --> 00:29:02.624
That tattoo removal scar,

348
00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:04.160
it's an interesting shape.

349
00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:07.067
Why did you serve, Marine?

350
00:29:08.468 --> 00:29:10.472
You requested to join
my task force,

351
00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:13.112
I wanted to help a female
officer climb the ladder.

352
00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:15.916
I'm not your enemy,
I'm not your friend.

353
00:29:15.949 --> 00:29:18.588
I'm your boss.
Respect that Sergeant.

354
00:29:19.189 --> 00:29:20.860
Sorry Ma'am.

355
00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:23.832
Disrespect me again,
you will be.

356
00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:27.474
I don't tolerate liars,
never have, never will.

357
00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:30.078
Now go get me something
I can use from the CCTV.

358
00:29:30.112 --> 00:29:32.549
Speak, don't speak,

359
00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:35.189
I got what I need to put
you in a prison cell.

360
00:29:35.222 --> 00:29:37.997
Cell's nothing compared to the
seven levels of hell I escaped.

361
00:29:39.096 --> 00:29:41.234
And that's if I go to prison.

362
00:29:41.268 --> 00:29:43.204
Oh you're going.

363
00:29:43.238 --> 00:29:45.610
I know all I need
to know about you.

364
00:29:45.642 --> 00:29:48.515
I know more about you
than you know about me.

365
00:29:48.548 --> 00:29:49.917
- Right-handed.
- Yeah

366
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.155
- Wanker.
- Yeah.

367
00:29:52.188 --> 00:29:53.725
Wife's cheating on you.

368
00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.597
Yeah. How the fuck
did you know...

369
00:30:02.309 --> 00:30:03.879
Pricks.

370
00:30:07.887 --> 00:30:09.691
Get out.

371
00:30:20.913 --> 00:30:22.817
I await your explanation.

372
00:30:22.849 --> 00:30:24.588
He wasn't talking.

373
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:26.891
- He wasn't talking?
- He wasn't talking.

374
00:30:26.924 --> 00:30:29.229
Did the claret get him chatting?

375
00:30:29.262 --> 00:30:31.898
Oh, he was talking before that,
just not about what we needed.

376
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.207
So you pulled a pencil on him.

377
00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:36.177
I did that because
he tricked Mac.

378
00:30:38.949 --> 00:30:41.221
Did you glean any useful info?

379
00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:43.756
He's a wanker.
We're both pricks,

380
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:46.297
Max's wife is cheating on him.

381
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:49.270
The tattoo he had scrubbed is,
it's military.

382
00:30:49.302 --> 00:30:51.807
If I can get a regiment
I can get a name.

383
00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.879
Off you fuck then.

384
00:30:56.151 --> 00:30:59.022
I knew she'd been
cheating with that chef prick.

385
00:30:59.056 --> 00:31:03.698
Two years she's been to that
cooking class and she's still shit.

386
00:31:21.467 --> 00:31:24.073
Good evening, Mr...

387
00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:29.250
Always worth a try.

388
00:31:29.282 --> 00:31:31.287
I'm Chief Inspector
Catherine Keaton

389
00:31:31.321 --> 00:31:34.294
and I'll be conducting
your interview now.

390
00:31:34.326 --> 00:31:36.364
Since you Houdini'ed out
so easily

391
00:31:36.396 --> 00:31:38.901
I see no reason
to cuff you again.

392
00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:40.740
No dramas.

393
00:31:42.074 --> 00:31:45.147
We can have a civilized
conversation, can't we?

394
00:31:45.181 --> 00:31:47.386
Civility ain't what
it used to be.

395
00:31:49.189 --> 00:31:52.429
Fuck off, Hooper!
Pull up his scar!

396
00:31:53.297 --> 00:31:55.201
So what is it?

397
00:31:55.234 --> 00:31:57.371
I'd bet Hooper's virginity
our boy's ex-military.

398
00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:59.310
Well, how do you know?

399
00:31:59.342 --> 00:32:01.043
He'd spunk his
shorts if a bird held his hand.

400
00:32:01.045 --> 00:32:02.549
Yeah, not Hooper, the scar.

401
00:32:02.583 --> 00:32:04.152
"R.M."

402
00:32:04.186 --> 00:32:06.123
Royal Marines Commando.

403
00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:08.227
Check military records
for those kicked out.

404
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:11.267
Proud Marines don't
remove their tats.

405
00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:13.440
My dad showed is off
enough for me to know that.

406
00:32:15.208 --> 00:32:18.882
It probably doesn't seem this
way, but I'm here to help.

407
00:32:18.915 --> 00:32:21.153
So it's your turn to try
and connect with me?

408
00:32:23.225 --> 00:32:26.063
Patience is a virtue
I hold dear.

409
00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:30.339
Was Serena Marcos
a patient person?

410
00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:36.116
Now, look what else I recovered.

411
00:32:41.661 --> 00:32:44.334
Welcome back, Judas.

412
00:32:44.366 --> 00:32:48.073
I would have run, but then traitors
are never remembered for their smarts.

413
00:32:49.944 --> 00:32:53.084
You know, when Guy Fawkes
failed to assassinate James 1st,

414
00:32:53.116 --> 00:32:55.221
he was to be
punished for treason.

415
00:32:55.254 --> 00:32:57.325
Hung from the gallows,

416
00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:00.198
balls severed, guts spilled.

417
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:04.173
After tonight,
what you've done...

418
00:33:06.076 --> 00:33:07.379
That's too polite.

419
00:33:08.614 --> 00:33:11.052
But Fawkes was smart,
unlike you.

420
00:33:11.085 --> 00:33:13.190
Before he could be eviscerated,

421
00:33:13.222 --> 00:33:14.961
he threw himself off
the scaffold,

422
00:33:14.993 --> 00:33:16.630
breaking his own neck.

423
00:33:16.664 --> 00:33:20.472
I suggest you take a leaf
out of his yellow-bellied book.

424
00:33:20.505 --> 00:33:24.212
Put that metal in your mouth and
squeeze till you feel a breeze.

425
00:33:24.244 --> 00:33:27.119
You shouldn't have killed her.

426
00:33:29.022 --> 00:33:31.227
She had nothing
to do with this world.

427
00:33:32.161 --> 00:33:33.732
This is my world.

428
00:33:33.764 --> 00:33:35.702
You brought her into it.

429
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.641
This is all on you.

430
00:33:38.675 --> 00:33:41.180
You die or she dies.

431
00:33:41.212 --> 00:33:43.319
That's the deal we made.

432
00:33:45.388 --> 00:33:47.459
You broke another promise.

433
00:33:47.493 --> 00:33:51.735
And now, you both die tonight.

434
00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.270
Serena?

435
00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:56.142
Serena?!

436
00:34:07.766 --> 00:34:09.603
I have an ear for guns.

437
00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:12.208
They whisper to me.

438
00:34:14.412 --> 00:34:18.086
Do you want to know what
they are saying right now?

439
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.290
"You're talking to a gun,
seek medical help."

440
00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:24.768
"Shoot me, I'm full."

441
00:34:26.636 --> 00:34:29.676
- What if I kill you first?
- He kills you.

442
00:34:31.345 --> 00:34:32.649
Okay.

443
00:34:37.692 --> 00:34:42.234
I promised Miss Serena
60 seconds of pugilism.

444
00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:45.741
So drop your weapon
and raise your fists.

445
00:34:45.775 --> 00:34:48.347
I guarantee when time is up,

446
00:34:49.214 --> 00:34:51.186
you'll beg for a bullet.

447
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.498
Even I know never trust a man who
thinks 60 seconds is impressive.

We have money.

468
00:36:53.797 --> 00:36:55.467
Make him dead.

469
00:36:57.838 --> 00:37:00.511
Serena Marcos a friend of yours?

470
00:37:00.544 --> 00:37:03.116
Do I seem like someone who
has a lot of friends to you?

471
00:37:03.885 --> 00:37:06.123
Is she dead?

472
00:37:06.155 --> 00:37:10.599
You know, I've always had trouble
putting names to faces. Faces the bodies.

473
00:37:10.632 --> 00:37:14.840
Ah, I'd kill to find some faces.

474
00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:16.102
We just seem to find limbs,

475
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:20.017
torsos, skulls,

476
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:24.192
bagged up buried like
a macabre pick 'n mix.

477
00:37:24.224 --> 00:37:27.866
Serena Marcos and her
associates at Club Knuckledust

478
00:37:27.899 --> 00:37:30.103
don't let us find a body

479
00:37:30.136 --> 00:37:33.076
to give the families who've
lost a loved one some peace.

480
00:37:33.877 --> 00:37:35.948
She, they,

481
00:37:35.981 --> 00:37:37.686
maybe even you,

482
00:37:37.718 --> 00:37:40.691
slice and dice
the bodies of the dead

483
00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:42.895
up into tiny teeny pieces.

484
00:37:42.928 --> 00:37:45.001
Smash the teeth.

485
00:37:45.869 --> 00:37:47.840
Burn off fingertips.

486
00:37:49.208 --> 00:37:51.680
I mean, I should be in
that interrogation room.

487
00:37:51.714 --> 00:37:53.984
I mean, I took the call.
I broke this case.

488
00:37:54.017 --> 00:37:55.487
I was first on scene.

489
00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.190
What have you done?

490
00:37:57.223 --> 00:37:59.696
I was running his prints
through a military database.

491
00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:04.740
Whoa, this is, this is
way above my pay grade.

492
00:38:04.772 --> 00:38:07.544
- Hooper, can you get in?
- I'm not allowed.

493
00:38:07.578 --> 00:38:08.914
That's not why I asked.

494
00:38:12.889 --> 00:38:14.694
Oh, okay, baby.

495
00:38:15.695 --> 00:38:16.998
Let's get this party...

496
00:38:17.031 --> 00:38:18.701
started!

497
00:38:18.734 --> 00:38:21.239
Swipe left, swipe left,
hello, swipe right.

498
00:38:21.272 --> 00:38:22.643
Match! Nice pic. Really?

499
00:38:22.676 --> 00:38:24.747
My mum took mine too.

500
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.684
Mm, fancy meeting up?
Cool, cool beans.

501
00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:28.588
I'll pick you
up at 6:00 p.m.

502
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:30.791
Wow, how old's your
profile picture?

503
00:38:30.824 --> 00:38:32.929
Yeah sunlight's a bitch.

504
00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:35.668
Hey, ho, hop on.
Mountain bike, five speed.

505
00:38:35.702 --> 00:38:37.338
Let's get romantical
and hit dinner.

506
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.109
Who needs candle light
when you have strip light?

507
00:38:40.143 --> 00:38:42.581
Every morsel of vegan chicken
in that bucket

508
00:38:42.615 --> 00:38:45.219
is un-caged tofu.

509
00:38:45.253 --> 00:38:46.891
Mmm. Fancy coming to mine?

510
00:38:46.923 --> 00:38:48.593
My mum's in hospital, cataracts.

511
00:38:48.628 --> 00:38:50.664
We have the basement
to ourselves.

512
00:38:50.697 --> 00:38:52.601
Oh, you like that?

513
00:38:52.636 --> 00:38:54.238
Oh, yeah,
slip off your firewalls.

514
00:38:54.271 --> 00:38:56.108
Your main frame is so soft.

515
00:38:56.142 --> 00:38:59.717
Oh, your password protected
security is so tight!

516
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:02.121
Oh, yeah,
oh, not the right spot?

517
00:39:02.154 --> 00:39:03.991
Guide me, baby, that's it.

518
00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:05.394
Oh, come on, that's it, baby,

519
00:39:05.427 --> 00:39:07.799
that's it, give it to me.
Yeah, oh, yeah!

520
00:39:07.832 --> 00:39:10.938
Mum! You're home early,
don't look, I can't stop.

521
00:39:10.971 --> 00:39:12.307
Keep going, that's it.

522
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:14.679
Come on, right there!

523
00:39:24.766 --> 00:39:26.938
Now, who looks like a virgin?

524
00:39:27.805 --> 00:39:28.808
- You.
- Always.

525
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.010
Forever.

526
00:39:31.078 --> 00:39:33.315
He was a war hero.

527
00:39:33.348 --> 00:39:35.788
Yeah, "was" being
the operative word.

528
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.737
Hickshill Police.

529
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:45.709
Okay, Mr...

530
00:39:52.086 --> 00:39:54.926
A very angry and loud
Colonel Vaughn is on his way

531
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.999
to pick up Brodie
in exactly 60 minutes.

532
00:39:58.032 --> 00:40:01.239
Why would a war hero work
somewhere that killed veterans?

533
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:04.044
Hooper send all
the evidence to my phone.

534
00:40:04.078 --> 00:40:06.490
I'm headed back to the scene.
We're missing something.

535
00:40:07.518 --> 00:40:09.255
Print Brodie's file.

536
00:40:09.288 --> 00:40:11.458
Oh, we need to warn Keaton.

537
00:40:11.491 --> 00:40:15.466
A few months back, Mac found
a forearm with a tattoo.

538
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.475
The name Siobhan embedded
in the hilt of a Gaelic blade

539
00:40:19.508 --> 00:40:21.947
above a military
regiment number.

540
00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.220
It led us to a sergeant
Jimmy James. Heard of him?

541
00:40:25.253 --> 00:40:28.426
Names, faces. No.

542
00:40:28.459 --> 00:40:32.200
Became homeless after losing
his wife Siobhan to cancer.

543
00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:35.206
Depression creeped
in the back door

544
00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:38.212
that the PTSD had snuck
in and left unlocked.

545
00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:43.523
Surprises us all at some point.

546
00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:46.896
His identity led us to the fact
that the homeless,

547
00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:48.332
many of them veterans,

548
00:40:48.365 --> 00:40:50.436
were disappearing
from our streets.

549
00:40:51.974 --> 00:40:53.878
I don't like it.

550
00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:56.215
These men deserve better.

551
00:40:56.248 --> 00:40:59.555
That's why I want Serena.
That's why you should help me.

552
00:41:00.489 --> 00:41:02.093
They my sympathies,

553
00:41:02.127 --> 00:41:05.400
but sympathy is not
Serena's strong point.

554
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:07.170
I'll tell you that for nothing.

555
00:41:16.454 --> 00:41:19.897
Everything on Captain
Roy Brodie.

556
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:29.582
This isn't everything.

557
00:41:29.614 --> 00:41:31.385
I found out who he is.

558
00:41:31.419 --> 00:41:33.256
You found out who he was.

559
00:41:33.288 --> 00:41:36.228
This tells me absolutely
nothing about right now.

560
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:38.466
We have him killing on camera.

561
00:41:38.498 --> 00:41:40.437
Well that's better.

562
00:41:41.338 --> 00:41:42.674
Any news on Serena?

563
00:41:42.707 --> 00:41:44.577
She was alive last we saw.

564
00:41:44.611 --> 00:41:48.019
Oh and Brodie's
Commanding Officer,

565
00:41:48.052 --> 00:41:51.024
Colonel Vaughn, will be in
60 minutes to collect him.

566
00:41:51.058 --> 00:41:53.330
How did he find out we had him?

567
00:41:53.363 --> 00:41:55.434
Brodie was flagged in
the military database.

568
00:41:55.466 --> 00:41:57.470
Hooper messed up, ma'am.

569
00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:04.351
Anything else?

570
00:42:04.385 --> 00:42:06.122
No ma'am.

571
00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:08.325
Oh, we need to warn Keaton.

572
00:42:08.358 --> 00:42:11.331
Vaughn said as this is a
military matter out-ranking us,

573
00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:13.569
anyone interviewing
his soldier when he arrives

574
00:42:13.602 --> 00:42:15.975
will be terminated
with immediate effect.

575
00:42:24.826 --> 00:42:27.230
No more excuses.
I give you one job tonight.

576
00:42:27.263 --> 00:42:29.234
Just man up. Put him down.

577
00:42:39.487 --> 00:42:42.627
I told you this is my world.

578
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:45.133
And I control everything in it.

579
00:42:52.313 --> 00:42:54.051
Fuck me.

580
00:42:56.388 --> 00:42:58.192
Nobody takes that literally.

581
00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:17.430
Let's start again.

582
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.805
I'm Chief Inspector
Catherine Keaton.

583
00:43:21.838 --> 00:43:27.417
Good evening Chief Inspector.
I'm captain Roy Brodie.

584
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.190
AWOL.

585
00:43:30.222 --> 00:43:31.792
Why'd you run?

586
00:43:31.825 --> 00:43:33.830
Oh, I didn't.

587
00:43:33.863 --> 00:43:35.767
Couldn't handle the pressure?

588
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.239
Pressure?

589
00:43:38.272 --> 00:43:40.743
You have no idea.

590
00:43:40.776 --> 00:43:45.219
You see corpses after
the fact. Not us.

591
00:43:45.252 --> 00:43:47.958
Must be hard in the mind.

592
00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:50.730
What you want me
to say? I'm broken?

593
00:43:50.762 --> 00:43:53.635
I can't talk about it?

594
00:43:53.669 --> 00:43:55.407
Nah.

595
00:43:55.439 --> 00:43:57.277
Oh, I'll talk about it freely.

596
00:43:58.278 --> 00:44:00.849
I'm proud to be a bootneck.

597
00:44:00.883 --> 00:44:03.556
I wore the blues With pride.

598
00:44:04.724 --> 00:44:06.895
Some of us come home

599
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.436
and they don't fit
back in that easy.

600
00:44:10.469 --> 00:44:12.404
Makes us think that
we should have rode home

601
00:44:12.406 --> 00:44:13.876
in a body bag after all.

602
00:44:15.746 --> 00:44:18.585
It's if we even
have a home anymore.

603
00:44:18.618 --> 00:44:21.725
AWOL meant I couldn't
work under my own name.

604
00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:25.000
But of cash in hand,
volunteering, stuff like that.

605
00:44:26.534 --> 00:44:28.605
Some of us.

606
00:44:28.639 --> 00:44:32.014
The streets we went away
to protect became our homes.

607
00:44:32.047 --> 00:44:34.518
Ceasing to exist anymore.
But in our...

608
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.926
Their own heads.

609
00:44:43.368 --> 00:44:44.572
It's hard.

610
00:44:46.608 --> 00:44:48.046
Hard to give orders.

611
00:44:50.016 --> 00:44:54.458
Even to yourself. When you're
so used to taking them.

612
00:44:54.491 --> 00:44:56.761
Surely you gave orders, Captain

613
00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:57.964
Many.

614
00:45:00.403 --> 00:45:03.343
And the one time I refuse
to someone dies.

615
00:45:03.375 --> 00:45:06.648
But I can't help thinking
it was his fault.

616
00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:09.088
Whose fault?

617
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:10.757
Major Vaughn.

618
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.396
You mean Colonel Vaughn.

619
00:45:13.429 --> 00:45:14.598
Promoted?

620
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:17.804
Doesn't surprise me.

621
00:45:17.837 --> 00:45:20.677
You know my name
he knows I'm here.

622
00:45:20.709 --> 00:45:23.482
He stopped me doing my job.
He'll stop you doing yours.

623
00:45:23.515 --> 00:45:25.119
He didn't stop you killing.

624
00:45:25.153 --> 00:45:27.057
My job wasn't to kill.

625
00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.762
It was to protect.

626
00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:31.999
The innocents.

627
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.974
My regiment.

628
00:45:36.007 --> 00:45:37.777
My soldiers.

629
00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.547
My country.

630
00:45:41.685 --> 00:45:43.390
A country I love.

631
00:45:46.795 --> 00:45:49.935
That didn't seem to love me when I
washed back, weary on its shores.

632
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.208
It's war.

633
00:45:53.242 --> 00:45:55.046
Men are supposed to die.

634
00:45:56.113 --> 00:45:57.214
Men.

635
00:45:58.586 --> 00:45:59.687
Yes.

636
00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.427
Boys...

637
00:46:07.503 --> 00:46:08.939
No.

638
00:46:08.973 --> 00:46:11.178
My queen, I fucking miss ya.

639
00:46:11.211 --> 00:46:14.184
And I'm gonna love the
fuck out of you when I get home.

640
00:46:14.216 --> 00:46:17.122
Tell my boy that Daddy
will be home soon.

641
00:46:17.156 --> 00:46:19.995
Tell him I miss him so
fucking much.

642
00:46:20.027 --> 00:46:22.766
Give him a squeeze for me.

643
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.644
And, er, tell that little pea in your belly
that I can't fucking wait to meet her.

644
00:46:27.677 --> 00:46:31.017
You always get me
through the days here.

645
00:46:31.049 --> 00:46:33.790
I miss the fuck out of you all.
So fucking much.

646
00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:37.028
Benchy.

647
00:46:40.101 --> 00:46:41.771
Is that all right, Cap?

648
00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:46.248
You love her, Private?

649
00:46:46.281 --> 00:46:49.053
Yeah, I fucking love her, Cap.

650
00:46:51.358 --> 00:46:54.899
Love, Benchy.

651
00:47:00.809 --> 00:47:02.947
Took out all the 'fucks' again.

652
00:47:04.918 --> 00:47:06.054
Thanks, Cap.

653
00:47:06.086 --> 00:47:07.924
Now fuck off, will ya?

654
00:47:16.374 --> 00:47:18.111
Major.

655
00:47:18.144 --> 00:47:21.385
Vaughn.
Promoted since birth.

656
00:47:21.417 --> 00:47:23.122
Make yourself scarce, son.

657
00:47:23.155 --> 00:47:24.924
He didn't learn names.

658
00:47:24.958 --> 00:47:26.862
We were already bodies
on a block to him.

659
00:47:26.895 --> 00:47:28.232
Skin statistics.

660
00:47:28.265 --> 00:47:29.968
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Major?

661
00:47:30.001 --> 00:47:31.402
Seeing out boys
out there without fear

662
00:47:31.404 --> 00:47:33.041
played well with the public.

663
00:47:33.073 --> 00:47:34.677
Who did you poll?
The enemy?

664
00:47:37.783 --> 00:47:39.754
Now that's a setup.

665
00:47:39.787 --> 00:47:42.257
No soldier with a brain,
or wants a brain in their skull,

666
00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.962
would walk around waiting to get
zapped without a bone dome on.

667
00:47:44.964 --> 00:47:47.804
The public saw no fear on
his face, neither did the enemy.

668
00:47:47.836 --> 00:47:49.741
We're trained
not to look scared,

669
00:47:49.773 --> 00:47:51.378
doesn't mean we're not.

670
00:47:52.914 --> 00:47:54.751
The Prime Minister
has made it a priority

671
00:47:54.784 --> 00:47:56.720
to get more of these
pictures out to the public.

672
00:47:56.722 --> 00:47:58.124
Then let her wander out there

673
00:47:58.157 --> 00:48:00.127
wearing just factor
forty and a smile.

674
00:48:00.161 --> 00:48:02.266
The PM wants to show
that we're winning.

675
00:48:02.299 --> 00:48:04.003
By losing soldiers?

676
00:48:04.035 --> 00:48:06.039
This is an order from up high.

677
00:48:06.072 --> 00:48:08.411
No, this is an order
from someone who is high.

678
00:48:08.444 --> 00:48:11.282
I won't tell my soldiers to act
in a way that'll get them killed,

679
00:48:11.284 --> 00:48:14.791
so as a condescending prick,
who's sacrificed nothing in their lives,

680
00:48:14.823 --> 00:48:17.393
only other people's children,
can prove to mummy and daddy

681
00:48:17.395 --> 00:48:20.436
they're king of a kingdom they
never deserved nor earned. Sir.

682
00:48:21.838 --> 00:48:24.077
I'm giving you
an order, Captain.

683
00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:28.017
And I'm disobeying it, Major.

684
00:48:42.913 --> 00:48:46.052
He ordered Bench
to go outside the compound,

685
00:48:46.086 --> 00:48:49.160
kick a ball around with
some kids for a photo-op.

686
00:48:49.193 --> 00:48:52.901
And he told them I gave the order
to go out there without his kit.

687
00:48:55.406 --> 00:48:57.944
He trusted me.

688
00:49:03.053 --> 00:49:05.392
And his last thoughts
were that I okayed that.

689
00:49:06.328 --> 00:49:08.466
That I killed him.

690
00:49:09.433 --> 00:49:11.070
He was just a boy.

691
00:49:12.505 --> 00:49:14.276
A kid.

692
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:16.514
But Vaughn won't forget either.

693
00:49:18.149 --> 00:49:20.555
When he looks in the mirror,
he'll remember me.

694
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:24.364
And he'll remember
Private Lee Bench.

695
00:49:24.397 --> 00:49:26.134
An eye for a lie.

696
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.608
He can never un-see that.

697
00:49:41.965 --> 00:49:44.135
Where did that come from now?

698
00:49:44.168 --> 00:49:46.471
I don't know. I don't want to see
where anything else comes from.

699
00:49:46.473 --> 00:49:48.546
I don't want to see
where anything else goes.

700
00:49:50.516 --> 00:49:51.652
Oh, no.

701
00:49:51.685 --> 00:49:53.088
It's not over.

702
00:52:22.885 --> 00:52:25.792
Well, he's not
getting past my kill squad

703
00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:28.699
with just a dildo in a smile.

704
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:31.872
He literally just got past the kill
squad with a dildo and a smile.

705
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:35.277
Touché.

706
00:52:38.651 --> 00:52:40.655
How old was Private Bench?

707
00:52:41.958 --> 00:52:44.429
Seventeen.

708
00:52:44.463 --> 00:52:48.304
My son, Noah, was the same age
on his first tour of Afghanistan.

709
00:52:49.005 --> 00:52:51.310
Is this where we bond?

710
00:52:51.342 --> 00:52:54.048
This is where I talk
to someone who understands

711
00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:57.321
why I want to help the men
your employer has you kill.

712
00:53:03.734 --> 00:53:05.371
Where's he stationed now?

713
00:53:05.971 --> 00:53:07.609
Bromley Cemetery.

714
00:53:08.811 --> 00:53:11.985
Roadside IED
on a routine patrol.

715
00:53:13.386 --> 00:53:15.525
No such thing as
routine out there.

716
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.067
Where was he stationed?

717
00:53:20.101 --> 00:53:22.472
Afghanistan.

718
00:53:22.505 --> 00:53:23.741
Where?

719
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:26.715
Kandahar.

720
00:53:26.748 --> 00:53:29.018
When did he die?

721
00:53:29.052 --> 00:53:31.491
Two years ago.

722
00:53:31.523 --> 00:53:33.460
I was there around then.

723
00:53:34.796 --> 00:53:37.635
He was only there a month.

724
00:53:37.668 --> 00:53:39.640
A month's enough.

725
00:53:41.777 --> 00:53:46.419
These soldiers' deaths
remind me of him every day.

726
00:53:46.453 --> 00:53:49.627
I couldn't save him but...

727
00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.933
maybe I can save them. Or you.

728
00:53:52.966 --> 00:53:54.671
I'm long past saving.

729
00:54:01.215 --> 00:54:04.422
Creating a dead son's
a bit fucking dark.

730
00:54:04.455 --> 00:54:07.094
Wow. He's still going.

731
00:54:07.128 --> 00:54:10.134
Wonder if Brodie
makes it out alive.

732
00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:13.073
- What?
- Wonder if he lives.

733
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:17.448
It's...

734
00:54:17.481 --> 00:54:18.584
What?

735
00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.591
Fuck's sake.

736
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.529
I'm getting worried.

737
00:54:24.563 --> 00:54:26.533
I got this covered.

738
00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:28.772
Kill squad in position.

739
00:54:28.804 --> 00:54:30.609
Jeremiah...

740
00:54:30.642 --> 00:54:31.775
do I have time
for a toilet break?

741
00:54:31.777 --> 00:54:34.049
Not now, Nigel.

742
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:36.118
He's coming.

743
00:54:36.152 --> 00:54:38.691
You can go for a piss after
you kill him, all right?

744
00:54:38.724 --> 00:54:40.895
You're a kill squad,
for fuck's sake.

745
00:54:44.068 --> 00:54:46.272
Would you care for
a cheeky bump Nigel?

746
00:54:46.305 --> 00:54:49.713
Not for me, mate.
Never touched the stuff.

747
00:54:50.582 --> 00:54:52.085
Surprise, cockface!

748
00:54:55.024 --> 00:54:56.995
Oh boy.

749
00:54:57.028 --> 00:54:59.062
- And what have you done now?
- I don't know, nothing.

750
00:54:59.064 --> 00:55:01.570
I pressed something.
Maybe. It was an accident.

751
00:55:01.604 --> 00:55:03.906
- You were an accident?
- You been talking to my mom?

752
00:55:03.908 --> 00:55:06.046
Just get it back, fuckstick.

753
00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:07.950
18 months.

754
00:55:07.983 --> 00:55:10.121
Yes, I am surprised.

755
00:55:10.153 --> 00:55:12.324
Because mathematically
you've been

756
00:55:12.358 --> 00:55:14.997
banging another bloke
for 75% of our marriage.

757
00:55:18.871 --> 00:55:21.043
You're breaking up.

758
00:55:21.076 --> 00:55:24.082
No not we're breaking up
there's bad signal down here,

759
00:55:24.115 --> 00:55:26.019
I'm just...

760
00:55:26.052 --> 00:55:30.094
What. No. No, I'm probably not
going to let this one go either.

761
00:55:31.095 --> 00:55:33.233
Detective. I'm SOCO Ellen Shaw.

762
00:55:33.265 --> 00:55:35.301
I've been told you're
looking for a dead woman.

763
00:55:35.303 --> 00:55:37.810
I can't afford to be picky.

764
00:55:40.413 --> 00:55:43.921
The suspect you have in custody
you think killed

765
00:55:43.954 --> 00:55:46.025
this Serena Marcos
you're looking for?

766
00:55:46.059 --> 00:55:48.193
Well, maybe. I mean,
he's a mean-looking bastard.

767
00:55:48.195 --> 00:55:50.635
I could take him. Probably.

768
00:55:51.236 --> 00:55:53.040
You're married.

769
00:55:53.073 --> 00:55:55.144
Married, dead inside,

770
00:55:55.177 --> 00:55:56.881
potato. potahto.

771
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.856
I've just seen
a mug shot of your suspect

772
00:56:00.889 --> 00:56:03.794
and it matches someone that
I've already seen tonight

773
00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:05.363
murder scene before this one.

774
00:56:05.397 --> 00:56:08.269
Multiple GSW.
Looks like a pro hit.

775
00:56:08.302 --> 00:56:09.973
- Can I borrow this?
- Mm.

776
00:56:12.879 --> 00:56:15.686
Redmond, I think
I found Brodie's trigger.

777
00:56:15.719 --> 00:56:17.690
I'm sending details now.

778
00:56:26.906 --> 00:56:31.048
We all lie, Roy. Every day.

779
00:56:31.082 --> 00:56:34.255
To hurt others, to keep
from hurting others,

780
00:56:34.288 --> 00:56:36.426
to keep from hurting ourselves.

781
00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:39.800
Who we are what we are.

782
00:56:39.832 --> 00:56:42.370
I think you've been
lying for so long.

783
00:56:42.403 --> 00:56:45.443
You don't even recognize
yourself anymore.

784
00:56:45.477 --> 00:56:49.753
I think the proud
Soldier you describe

785
00:56:49.786 --> 00:56:55.264
yourself as would be disgusted
with civilian Roy Brodie, hm?

786
00:57:01.843 --> 00:57:03.379
Is that what you're into?

787
00:57:03.413 --> 00:57:06.019
Multiple gunshots, close range.

788
00:57:08.222 --> 00:57:10.460
Let her go, Brodie!

789
00:57:10.494 --> 00:57:12.933
I'm fine, we're fine,

790
00:57:12.965 --> 00:57:15.036
lower your weapon

791
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.442
or it will be the last
time you raise it, Sergeant.

792
00:57:18.075 --> 00:57:19.212
Do it.

793
00:57:29.164 --> 00:57:30.902
Talk to me, Roy.

794
00:57:32.571 --> 00:57:34.542
Hmm? What happened?

795
00:57:34.575 --> 00:57:37.347
I didn't kill Chrissy.

796
00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.988
I'm a killer, yeah.

797
00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:45.064
But I'm not a murderer.
This is all my fault.

798
00:57:45.096 --> 00:57:48.603
If I'd just gone down
on the third, died tonight,

799
00:57:48.636 --> 00:57:52.344
taken my punishment,
maybe she'd still be alive.

800
00:57:52.377 --> 00:57:55.217
No. I thought that...

801
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.533
No, I thought that Hot Lips
heard me on the phone with

802
00:58:03.565 --> 00:58:05.337
Chrissy two nights ago.

803
00:58:08.076 --> 00:58:12.485
Oh, he told Serena, so she
knew I'd broken the fourth rule.

804
00:58:12.518 --> 00:58:14.222
Don't lie to them.

805
00:58:16.225 --> 00:58:20.067
And by lying,
I also broke their second rule.

806
00:58:20.099 --> 00:58:23.239
Can't be anybody waiting
for me when I get home.

807
00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:27.647
Hi.

808
00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.318
Hey.

809
00:58:32.424 --> 00:58:35.933
So... last night?

810
00:58:36.466 --> 00:58:37.970
Last night.

811
00:58:39.437 --> 00:58:42.311
Didn't we agree not
to say "I love you."

812
00:58:43.212 --> 00:58:44.416
Yet.

813
00:58:45.182 --> 00:58:47.020
Yet?

814
00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:49.324
I definitely think we
shouldn't buckle

815
00:58:49.358 --> 00:58:51.595
under peer pressure
to be one of those couples.

816
00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.599
We're... are a couple?

817
00:58:53.632 --> 00:58:56.339
Um, well, I mean...

818
00:58:58.309 --> 00:59:00.314
I like the sound of that.

819
00:59:00.347 --> 00:59:04.222
But you're right,
we won't be one of those

820
00:59:04.255 --> 00:59:06.459
couples who say I love
you at every opportunity.

821
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:08.062
That's just sickening.

822
00:59:08.096 --> 00:59:12.038
Yuck! They're the worst.

823
00:59:12.071 --> 00:59:15.244
I hope this chat has cleared up
all this "I love you" business.

824
00:59:15.277 --> 00:59:18.584
So, I never ever say

825
00:59:19.518 --> 00:59:20.787
"I love you."

826
00:59:21.522 --> 00:59:23.027
Cheater.

827
00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:25.765
Never. I Promise.

828
00:59:28.770 --> 00:59:31.175
I wish I never met Serena.

829
00:59:32.144 --> 00:59:34.448
It was all by chance, you know.

830
00:59:35.852 --> 00:59:37.585
I was bouncing at night,
was volunteering

831
00:59:37.587 --> 00:59:40.259
at a shelter in the day.

832
00:59:40.293 --> 00:59:42.630
Happy and Hot Lips
came a visiting one morning

833
00:59:42.663 --> 00:59:44.734
hunting for new meat to mince.

834
00:59:44.768 --> 00:59:46.272
I asked them to leave.

835
00:59:46.304 --> 00:59:48.310
I was nice, they didn't listen.

836
00:59:48.343 --> 00:59:51.116
So, it was time to not be nice.

837
00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:55.356
They ran home
and cried to Serena.

838
00:59:55.389 --> 00:59:58.295
She wanted to meet
the man who messed them up.

839
00:59:58.329 --> 01:00:01.368
Jeremiah begrudgingly
offered me a job and...

840
01:00:03.205 --> 01:00:05.443
I needed the money.

841
01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:10.153
Going up?

842
01:00:10.687 --> 01:00:12.492
Not now, Nigel.

843
01:00:16.831 --> 01:00:18.136
Wankstain.

844
01:00:20.574 --> 01:00:22.344
Can I grab a gum?

845
01:00:22.377 --> 01:00:23.911
Don't think you're
gonna like this flavor.

846
01:00:23.913 --> 01:00:25.817
It's spicy.
Blow the head off ya.

847
01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.496
Hot Lips,
Happy, head back upstairs.

848
01:00:31.529 --> 01:00:33.567
You, follow me.

849
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.703
Where's this Serena I'm meeting?

850
01:00:35.737 --> 01:00:38.577
That's Miss Serena
to you, Palooka.

851
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.181
She's waiting for you in there.

852
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:43.452
Barry.

853
01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:48.863
This is the final stop
on the Knuckledust tour.

854
01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:52.271
It's not pretty but
it's where the magic happens.

855
01:00:53.473 --> 01:00:55.578
What magic happens
through there?

856
01:00:57.346 --> 01:00:58.916
That's my office.

857
01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.222
Nobody goes in there
without an invitation.

858
01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.831
Bulletproof.

859
01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.601
Put it in myself.

860
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:09.973
Bulletproof?

861
01:01:10.006 --> 01:01:12.011
I'm protected.

862
01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.548
And as long as you work
with me, so are you.

863
01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:17.354
All I ask is that
you don't lie to me.

864
01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:21.796
It's the one rule we all live
by in the Knuckledust family.

865
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:24.935
Do you have kids,
parents, siblings, pets,

866
01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:27.007
a partner, coffee?

867
01:01:27.039 --> 01:01:29.878
Why? Er, yes, please,
black, no sugar.

868
01:01:31.014 --> 01:01:32.885
Hey. Coffee.

869
01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:39.865
Because that complicates things.

870
01:01:39.897 --> 01:01:42.837
You lose a fight
or God forbid, you die.

871
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.076
We have to make you disappear.

872
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.383
We can't have people at home
missing you looking for you.

873
01:01:48.415 --> 01:01:49.652
Complicates the business

874
01:01:49.685 --> 01:01:51.656
I got nothin', got nobody.

875
01:01:52.523 --> 01:01:53.727
You'll fit right in.

876
01:01:56.965 --> 01:01:59.705
He's deaf. And dumb.

877
01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:05.050
Good thing he's strong
or he'd be a dead dodo.

878
01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:08.522
Then he would just be a dodo.
They're already extinct, so.

879
01:02:08.555 --> 01:02:11.129
Oh, clever.

880
01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:13.065
Clever, clever science.

881
01:02:13.866 --> 01:02:15.471
Man, dick.

882
01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.574
First fight is Friday night,

883
01:02:34.608 --> 01:02:36.579
the bigger the betting
the more you earn,

884
01:02:36.612 --> 01:02:38.146
the more you win
the more they bet.

885
01:02:38.148 --> 01:02:39.584
Circle of death.

886
01:02:39.617 --> 01:02:40.754
I don't kill.

887
01:02:40.786 --> 01:02:43.192
Break bones, bleed blood.

888
01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.962
Spill less than the other guys,

889
01:02:44.995 --> 01:02:46.952
just keep it entertaining
that's all we ask.

890
01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:50.506
We?

891
01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:52.042
Sorry?

892
01:02:52.077 --> 01:02:54.013
You said "we."

893
01:02:54.046 --> 01:02:56.152
Oh, I meant the royal "we."

894
01:02:57.153 --> 01:02:59.492
Any problems, contact Jeremiah.

895
01:02:59.957 --> 01:03:01.528
Anytime.

896
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:05.069
My number's 0800 blow me.

897
01:03:05.103 --> 01:03:07.507
You still live at home?

898
01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.611
- What?
- That's your mother's work number.

899
01:03:10.947 --> 01:03:13.620
It's your mom's landline number.

900
01:03:13.653 --> 01:03:16.993
Listen, I don't want to get
pig-lifted by the boys in blue.

901
01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:19.231
Won't happen, can't happen.

902
01:03:19.264 --> 01:03:21.802
You see we have friends
in not just high places,

903
01:03:21.835 --> 01:03:23.139
but the highest of places.

904
01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:27.581
Now...

905
01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:30.687
let's give you a name.

906
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.126
Something to get
gamblers gambling.

907
01:03:33.158 --> 01:03:35.696
You're implying they have
a copper in their pocket?

908
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:36.998
One of my team?

909
01:03:37.031 --> 01:03:39.904
Just one?
They have deep pockets.

910
01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:43.679
None of my team of crooked.

911
01:03:43.712 --> 01:03:46.585
If they are all still your team.

912
01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.344
We have to stop meeting
like this.

913
01:04:00.145 --> 01:04:01.715
Ah, fucking hell.

914
01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.689
Which floor is this?

915
01:04:08.729 --> 01:04:09.865
Weird.

916
01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:15.644
Don't Pinter pause me.
What's weird?

917
01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:18.616
This time stamp,
it's not from tonight. It's old.

918
01:04:19.885 --> 01:04:21.389
That is weird.

919
01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:22.758
Where's Ellen?

920
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.894
Ellen? Don't know.

921
01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:28.202
But I'm going to follow her suit
by leaving and not coming back.

922
01:04:28.235 --> 01:04:31.242
Bit like your first wife.

923
01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:33.145
Fucking hell,
kick me when I'm down.

924
01:04:33.178 --> 01:04:35.784
You're lucky I don't
kick seven bells of shit...

925
01:04:36.884 --> 01:04:39.757
Seven bells.

926
01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:43.733
A cell's nothing compared to the
seven levels of hell I escaped.

927
01:06:47.279 --> 01:06:49.718
You don't just want Serena.

928
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:54.428
You want the other half,
the royal "we."

929
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:57.265
I'm gonna find them.

930
01:06:57.299 --> 01:07:00.004
Burn down everything
someone loves and wait.

931
01:07:01.574 --> 01:07:04.681
They'll come looking
for you in the flames.

932
01:07:04.713 --> 01:07:08.287
Where do you start looking for
someone you know nothing about?

933
01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.967
There were whispers of a butcher
and his blades on a horse and cart.

934
01:07:15.536 --> 01:07:17.708
Whispers echoed loudly
from Serena.

935
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:23.084
She took pride in regaling me
of how she learned to

936
01:07:23.117 --> 01:07:25.021
disappear the bodies
of dead fighters

937
01:07:25.054 --> 01:07:26.658
like a backdoor butcher.

938
01:07:27.593 --> 01:07:29.765
So I dug a little deeper.

939
01:07:31.735 --> 01:07:33.338
The irony.

940
01:07:39.282 --> 01:07:41.488
A walk the cobbles
working class man,

941
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.594
his kid went
everywhere with him.

942
01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.498
Piss poor.

943
01:07:46.531 --> 01:07:49.303
But as many has
instilled in them back then,

944
01:07:49.335 --> 01:07:51.574
they had a true work ethic.

945
01:07:51.608 --> 01:07:54.381
Their faces got known
amongst the ruling class,

946
01:07:54.414 --> 01:07:57.853
most of whom live without
rules and die without class.

947
01:07:57.886 --> 01:08:01.260
At those windows salivating
for scraps.

948
01:08:02.663 --> 01:08:04.699
At least that's what
the elite eaters thought.

949
01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:07.506
You see, this guy and his kid,

950
01:08:07.539 --> 01:08:11.815
they provided a very
unique service.

951
01:08:11.847 --> 01:08:16.390
On the face of it you saw a normal
and respectable family business.

952
01:08:16.423 --> 01:08:19.497
But it was all just
a song and dance.

953
01:08:19.531 --> 01:08:21.602
Kid never stood a chance.

954
01:08:21.635 --> 01:08:24.741
When you're locked into
a life of secrets and lies,

955
01:08:24.774 --> 01:08:28.483
how can you ever know what
the truth truly looks like?

956
01:08:30.251 --> 01:08:32.457
They were putting on a show.

957
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:41.474
Disappear those
who had wronged the wrong man.

958
01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:45.450
He taught the kid well.
No teeth, no dental records,

959
01:08:46.282 --> 01:08:48.154
no identification.

960
01:08:54.365 --> 01:08:56.871
Slice and dice
with skill and precision.

961
01:08:58.508 --> 01:09:00.646
Choice cuts, sound familiar?

962
01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:02.750
Forearms with tattoos.

963
01:09:06.691 --> 01:09:09.464
The final act was the reveal.

964
01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:12.769
And the audience applauds.

965
01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:15.342
But the tale ended
as they all do.

966
01:09:17.846 --> 01:09:19.618
Grimly.

967
01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:22.857
They served up someone
that they shouldn't have.

968
01:09:22.890 --> 01:09:25.830
- And the kid?
- Well, the kid grew up.

969
01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:29.671
Years later,

970
01:09:29.704 --> 01:09:32.711
everyone connected to
the Rag and Bone man's death

971
01:09:33.678 --> 01:09:34.914
Was wiped out.

972
01:09:37.085 --> 01:09:38.589
Rats ratted.

973
01:09:38.621 --> 01:09:40.859
Businesses burned. Arrests made.

974
01:09:44.634 --> 01:09:46.304
You walked into prison,

975
01:09:46.337 --> 01:09:48.475
you were body bagged back out.

976
01:09:48.508 --> 01:09:50.579
Think it has something
to do with the kid?

977
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:57.358
Each of the dead bodies had
a chunk cut out and left behind.

978
01:09:57.392 --> 01:10:00.332
Indicating who was dead.

979
01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:03.738
A tattoo, a ring finger.

980
01:10:05.408 --> 01:10:08.649
Wrapped in brown paper,
tied with string

981
01:10:09.584 --> 01:10:11.354
and left beside the body.

982
01:10:13.056 --> 01:10:15.696
Just like Daddy did.

983
01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:22.810
You're a hell of a storyteller.

984
01:10:22.842 --> 01:10:25.515
I really hope some
of them are true.

985
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.856
So do I.

986
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.502
You better have
washed your hands.

987
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.651
Get in!

988
01:10:47.893 --> 01:10:49.029
What happened to you?

989
01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:50.566
Cocaine.

990
01:10:50.999 --> 01:10:52.637
No shit!

991
01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:53.872
No, just piss.

992
01:10:53.905 --> 01:10:55.008
I couldn't hold it.

993
01:10:57.913 --> 01:11:00.051
How are you in here?

994
01:11:00.084 --> 01:11:01.688
I played dead.

995
01:11:01.721 --> 01:11:03.522
And then when Brodie
went to the bathroom,

996
01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:06.197
lucky bastard, I just snuck
past them and escaped.

997
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:08.099
- Escaped?
- Mm-hm.

998
01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:10.806
You realize you could
have gotten out of here alive

999
01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:13.044
if you'd run the other way?

1000
01:11:13.076 --> 01:11:14.847
Oh, yeah.

1001
01:11:14.881 --> 01:11:16.685
Never thought about that.

1002
01:11:16.718 --> 01:11:18.756
Not now, Nigel, just change.

1003
01:11:19.757 --> 01:11:21.060
You reek.

1004
01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:22.863
Go.

1005
01:11:48.647 --> 01:11:50.551
Dumbnuts better not
let him get to you

1006
01:11:50.586 --> 01:11:52.723
or I'll kill him myself.

1007
01:11:52.755 --> 01:11:55.713
If Hard Eight gets to me that means
you're already dead, Jeremiah.

1008
01:11:57.130 --> 01:11:59.202
Gun up. Kill him!

1009
01:12:01.373 --> 01:12:03.044
I'm going for a cigarette.

1010
01:12:03.076 --> 01:12:04.176
I thought you quit.

1011
01:12:04.179 --> 01:12:05.850

now my birthday Berettas.

1039
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.206
My Nan's gonna go mental.

1040
01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.341
Not now, Nigel.

1041
01:15:20.170 --> 01:15:21.707
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1042
01:15:25.213 --> 01:15:27.718
Tombstone was sat here,
right in front of them.

1043
01:16:20.723 --> 01:16:22.394
Where's Serena?

1044
01:16:22.428 --> 01:16:23.964
She's in her fucking office.

1045
01:16:27.837 --> 01:16:29.676
Don't look at me like that.

1046
01:16:29.708 --> 01:16:32.347
You were the one that said
look in the lost and found.

1047
01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:35.287
I was pointing at
the protective gear.

1048
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.227
I'm not some fucking fuckboy
fucker you can just laugh at.

1049
01:16:38.259 --> 01:16:41.166
"Oh, look at Nigel, he's pissed
himself again."

1050
01:16:41.198 --> 01:16:43.203
Unbelievable!

1051
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.316
I come in here every day

1052
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.288
for a paycheck
that my Nan laughs at.

1053
01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:54.826
I can barely afford
to rent her basement.

1054
01:16:54.858 --> 01:16:56.795
I go to the cafe for my lunch.

1055
01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:58.600
I never get
reimbursed for petrol.

1056
01:16:58.632 --> 01:17:00.771
Not now, Nigel!

1057
01:17:00.803 --> 01:17:04.546
All I would like to be is respected
for my achievements in here!

1058
01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.450
What do you want,
Thug of the Month?

1059
01:17:07.483 --> 01:17:09.288
A kiss from the Queen?

1060
01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:10.724
You're a hired goon.

1061
01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:13.463
We all are.

1062
01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:16.938
There's no award for a man
who defecates his own pants.

1063
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:18.907
Dick of the day,

1064
01:17:18.941 --> 01:17:20.810
every day, you can have that.

1065
01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.417
I'm a self-employed dick!

1066
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:25.321
I know what I'll do.
Fuck this place.

1067
01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:26.823
I'll fucking unionize. I just...

1068
01:17:26.855 --> 01:17:29.328
Not now, Nigel. It's all right.

1069
01:17:30.363 --> 01:17:31.499
It's all right.

1070
01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.279
What's he playing at?

1071
01:17:38.813 --> 01:17:40.684
It's disgusting.

1072
01:17:40.717 --> 01:17:44.258
He's always gobbling out of his
gob and sticking it in things.

1073
01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.796
There's loads of it
under that coffee table.

1074
01:17:52.006 --> 01:17:53.376
Bulletproof?

1075
01:17:54.744 --> 01:17:56.349
That's not chewing gum.

1076
01:17:57.784 --> 01:17:58.885
Bollocks.

1077
01:18:29.848 --> 01:18:34.458
Is this where you deliver
a cool yet comical one liner?

1078
01:18:34.491 --> 01:18:35.628
Nope.

1079
01:18:39.602 --> 01:18:41.973
I didn't know I was going to do

1080
01:18:42.007 --> 01:18:44.645
when I finally had
her in my grasp.

1081
01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.115
I was just so...

1082
01:18:48.553 --> 01:18:51.126
I could feel the bubbling
under my skin.

1083
01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:56.036
My veins coursing
with vengeance.

1084
01:19:00.877 --> 01:19:03.517
I just wanted her to feel
the pain I felt,

1085
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:04.819
that Chrissy felt.

1086
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.091
In that moment.

1087
01:19:07.124 --> 01:19:09.061
What did you do, Brodie?

1088
01:19:17.944 --> 01:19:19.516
I got lost again.

1089
01:19:21.117 --> 01:19:22.889
She had that ability.

1090
01:19:24.758 --> 01:19:28.667
Her siren call luring me into
the depths of hell once more.

1091
01:19:32.006 --> 01:19:35.480
I pulled her hair tightly
around my fingers.

1092
01:19:38.051 --> 01:19:39.855
A little harder each time.

1093
01:19:41.758 --> 01:19:43.129
It felt wrong,

1094
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:44.731
it was wrong.

1095
01:19:45.967 --> 01:19:48.005
Then again, she never
liked it right.

1096
01:19:51.946 --> 01:19:54.519
I loved Chrissy, but that world,

1097
01:19:55.253 --> 01:19:57.291
it was a different life.

1098
01:19:57.323 --> 01:19:59.261
Different me.

1099
01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.734
Like being back in battle.

1100
01:20:02.768 --> 01:20:05.941
That man couldn't possibly exist
in the real world.

1101
01:20:05.974 --> 01:20:08.213
In Chrissy's world.

1102
01:20:08.245 --> 01:20:10.183
I could pass off
the cuts and bruises,

1103
01:20:10.215 --> 01:20:12.620
but I couldn't lie next to her.

1104
01:20:12.654 --> 01:20:14.859
Touch her with blood
under my fingernails.

1105
01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:18.165
She could never understand.

1106
01:20:18.198 --> 01:20:20.001
If I'm honest,

1107
01:20:20.035 --> 01:20:21.705
I never wanted her to.

1108
01:20:23.175 --> 01:20:24.978
Serena understood.

1109
01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:28.620
Serena loved that side of me.

1110
01:20:28.653 --> 01:20:31.225
She loved peeling
the blood dust from my knuckles

1111
01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:33.730
as we lay in bed.

1112
01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:35.299
When did this start?

1113
01:20:35.333 --> 01:20:37.605
I want the boss to know.

1114
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.210
Every time they was with Serena.

1115
01:20:41.277 --> 01:20:43.649
I'd been there an hour before.

1116
01:20:43.682 --> 01:20:46.590
Inside her, on her, over her.

1117
01:20:48.993 --> 01:20:50.296
She loved the danger.

1118
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:52.868
She loved it,
every second of it.

1119
01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.708
And she was open to everything,
men, women.

1120
01:20:56.742 --> 01:20:58.111
Why would she do this?

1121
01:20:58.146 --> 01:21:00.049
Serena was the face.

1122
01:21:01.718 --> 01:21:02.887
If the hammer fell,

1123
01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.291
she went down.

1124
01:21:04.323 --> 01:21:07.096
She felt taken advantage of.
Unprotected.

1125
01:21:08.098 --> 01:21:10.036
She hated the boss for that.

1126
01:21:10.069 --> 01:21:11.906
She tell you who the boss was?

1127
01:21:11.938 --> 01:21:13.376
No, not yet.

1128
01:21:14.944 --> 01:21:16.749
She was protecting me.

1129
01:21:18.018 --> 01:21:19.222
Why?

1130
01:21:20.122 --> 01:21:22.161
Because she loves me.

1131
01:21:24.062 --> 01:21:28.205
And I love her.
I love, loved them both.

1132
01:21:29.942 --> 01:21:32.347
I couldn't kill her.

1133
01:21:32.379 --> 01:21:34.418
She's called the police on you.

1134
01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:42.901
She's playing you,
you can't save her.

1135
01:21:42.933 --> 01:21:45.340
You're going away,
Roy, for a long time.

1136
01:21:45.373 --> 01:21:46.943
She deserves to do the same.

1137
01:21:46.976 --> 01:21:49.449
Help me talk to me please.

1138
01:21:51.285 --> 01:21:53.155
She called the police on me?

1139
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:54.292
Yeah.

1140
01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:03.042
I want to talk to you,
only you, but...

1141
01:22:41.285 --> 01:22:43.389
Colonel Vaughn, I presume?

1142
01:22:43.422 --> 01:22:45.193
Let me show you to your soldier.

1143
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.002
Serena's playing you.

1144
01:22:50.035 --> 01:22:53.610
There were no orders to
kill Chrissy except from her.

1145
01:22:53.642 --> 01:22:57.048
Think. She recruited you.

1146
01:22:57.082 --> 01:23:00.323
She's the face of the business
because she is the business.

1147
01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:02.193
She ordered the hit.

1148
01:23:02.225 --> 01:23:03.929
She's going to get
me out of here.

1149
01:23:03.963 --> 01:23:07.471
She promised.
We're taking the money.

1150
01:23:07.504 --> 01:23:09.675
And we're disappearing.

1151
01:23:09.707 --> 01:23:11.945
If she's waiting for you,

1152
01:23:11.978 --> 01:23:15.085
it's to make sure the evidence
is gone and finish the job.

1153
01:23:15.118 --> 01:23:17.991
That's why she called
us to come get you.

1154
01:23:18.023 --> 01:23:21.665
You're the last witness,
the last piece of evidence.

1155
01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:58.238
Be a hero.

1156
01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:01.111
Like Noah, Bench, Jimmy.

1157
01:24:02.111 --> 01:24:04.016
Don't let them die in vain.

1158
01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:07.623
She doesn't love you.
She doesn't love anyone.

1159
01:24:07.657 --> 01:24:10.228
She called us, set you up.

1160
01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:12.166
She send us to find you, Roy.

1161
01:24:14.538 --> 01:24:16.542
She told me
to destroy the hard drives,

1162
01:24:16.574 --> 01:24:20.081
the CCTV, then come back.

1163
01:24:20.115 --> 01:24:22.654
I was supposed to have ages,
but then...

1164
01:24:24.089 --> 01:24:25.624
I wasn't expecting her
to call you.

1165
01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:27.464
Where is Serena?

1166
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.238
At the flat I shared
with Chrissy.

1167
01:24:35.244 --> 01:24:36.816
I tried to stop him, Ma'am.

1168
01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.757
On your feet, soldier.

1169
01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.937
Surely you haven't forgotten how
to salute a superior officer.

1170
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.636
You haven't changed.
But you will.

1171
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:05.773
I've got my eye on you, boy.

1172
01:25:05.805 --> 01:25:08.310
He's our lead suspect.

1173
01:25:08.343 --> 01:25:10.617
He's your last suspect.

1174
01:25:10.649 --> 01:25:15.425
A letter of resignation will
be on your desk by 9:00 a.m.

1175
01:25:15.458 --> 01:25:20.537
I told your chimp that anyone
I find interviewing my soldier,

1176
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:22.608
terminated with
immediate effect.

1177
01:25:23.742 --> 01:25:25.580
Is there any paperwork?

1178
01:25:25.612 --> 01:25:27.583
You can sign him
out at the front desk.

1179
01:25:27.617 --> 01:25:29.888
You have no jurisdiction here.

1180
01:25:29.921 --> 01:25:31.626
I have jurisdiction everywhere.

1181
01:25:39.574 --> 01:25:42.780
Did you, um, get any leads
from Brodie, ma'am?

1182
01:25:42.814 --> 01:25:46.588
I did. They were
always one step ahead.

1183
01:25:46.622 --> 01:25:49.393
We finally managed
to get a break

1184
01:25:49.426 --> 01:25:52.767
and my team do their
damndest to fuck it up.

1185
01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:54.837
I'm the only person
I can trust now.

1186
01:25:54.871 --> 01:25:58.411
I have one night
left in this job,

1187
01:25:58.444 --> 01:26:01.217
and I intend on
closing the case.

1188
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:11.572
Put him down. Now.

1189
01:26:48.778 --> 01:26:50.849
Now it's Keaton's turn to burn.

1190
01:26:52.819 --> 01:26:55.860
The mobile you have
dialed has been disconnected.

1191
01:26:55.893 --> 01:26:57.063
Fuck!

1192
01:26:59.566 --> 01:27:02.038
Come on, come on, come on.

1193
01:27:02.072 --> 01:27:04.644
This is Keaton, leave a message.

1194
01:27:05.144 --> 01:27:06.981
Fuck!

1195
01:27:11.925 --> 01:27:13.829
Hello?

1196
01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.696
Keaton's in trouble.
She's not answering her phone.

1197
01:27:15.698 --> 01:27:17.065
She said she was
following up on a lead.

1198
01:27:17.067 --> 01:27:18.906
Get Hooper to track her.

1199
01:27:18.938 --> 01:27:21.712
Hooper's gone.
Phone disconnected, evidence gone.

1200
01:27:21.744 --> 01:27:25.418
I think, I think he just blew up a
jeep with Brodie and two soldiers.

1201
01:27:25.452 --> 01:27:27.456
Hooper? That bellend?

1202
01:27:27.489 --> 01:27:29.761
He's watched every step we make.

1203
01:27:29.793 --> 01:27:31.964
Acting the fool, tripping us up.

1204
01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:34.069
Now he's just tying
up his loose ends.

1205
01:27:34.101 --> 01:27:36.238
Well, we've got a few more
swimmers in their witness pool,

1206
01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.979
so maybe one of these lads
can give us some info on him.

1207
01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:41.818
Until they do,
Keaton's on her own.

1208
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:08.004
Brodie?

1209
01:28:10.074 --> 01:28:11.912
I've missed you baby.

1210
01:28:12.679 --> 01:28:14.215
Katherine?

1211
01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:15.551
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:28:16.688 --> 01:28:19.527
I'm sorry.

1213
01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.769
Sorry I ever loved you.

1214
01:28:31.584 --> 01:28:32.954
I have to applaud you.

1215
01:28:34.991 --> 01:28:37.897
Setting up a task force
to take down yourself.

1216
01:28:39.066 --> 01:28:41.905
You, you're under arrest.

1217
01:28:41.937 --> 01:28:43.942
Serena was on the run.

1218
01:28:43.975 --> 01:28:46.247
She needed protection.

1219
01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.919
A mentor. A partner.

1220
01:28:50.288 --> 01:28:52.794
Some would say a royal "we."

1221
01:28:54.061 --> 01:28:56.032
You can't connect me to Serena.

1222
01:28:56.066 --> 01:28:57.704
I don't need to.

1223
01:28:58.939 --> 01:29:00.609
Serena will.

1224
01:29:01.877 --> 01:29:03.982
Cameras get everywhere
these days.

1225
01:29:09.826 --> 01:29:12.332
Katherine?
I'm so sorry, I...

1226
01:29:14.871 --> 01:29:16.274
I'm sorry.

1227
01:29:19.045 --> 01:29:21.117
Sorry I ever loved you.

1228
01:29:22.252 --> 01:29:23.789
She killed me.

1229
01:29:24.924 --> 01:29:26.728
I don't believe it.

1230
01:29:30.769 --> 01:29:32.138
Password.

1231
01:29:33.708 --> 01:29:36.312
Do you understand
how high up this goes?

1232
01:29:36.346 --> 01:29:38.786
They'll kill me before
I drop a single name.

1233
01:29:38.819 --> 01:29:41.390
I'll kill you now if you don't.

1234
01:29:41.423 --> 01:29:43.763
Password to
your accounts, please.

1235
01:29:49.472 --> 01:29:51.443
You want their money?

1236
01:29:51.477 --> 01:29:55.285
We don't need their money,
but we know it hurts them.

1237
01:29:55.317 --> 01:29:57.823
Sunlight is
the best disinfectant.

1238
01:29:57.856 --> 01:30:00.461
Names in the open, they'll be
too busy with damage control

1239
01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.899
to worry about you.

1240
01:30:09.545 --> 01:30:11.851
Police station's that way.

1241
01:30:11.884 --> 01:30:14.523
Don't think about running.

1242
01:30:14.555 --> 01:30:17.228
Ask for Redmond or MacCready.

1243
01:30:17.262 --> 01:30:19.166
Good cops in bad times.

1244
01:30:31.557 --> 01:30:32.860
I see you.

1245
01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:35.933
Now we all see you.

1246
01:30:37.135 --> 01:30:39.473
What did I ever do to you?

1247
01:30:39.505 --> 01:30:41.845
You have a good memory.

1248
01:30:41.877 --> 01:30:43.446
You remember Ben?

1249
01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.018
Ben?

1250
01:30:46.185 --> 01:30:48.223
Torn in half at your club.

1251
01:30:48.257 --> 01:30:50.461
Eye popped out of its socket.

1252
01:30:50.493 --> 01:30:52.866
Dead. Discarded.

1253
01:30:53.601 --> 01:30:55.972
No funeral. No family.

1254
01:30:56.006 --> 01:30:57.308
Club rules.

1255
01:30:57.342 --> 01:30:59.445
He was my little brother!

1256
01:31:00.915 --> 01:31:03.321
I don't remember.

1257
01:31:05.992 --> 01:31:10.101
I'm fucking messing.
I'm messing.

1258
01:31:10.133 --> 01:31:13.541
I always wanted to do a "Murder She
Wrote" this is why I did it ending.

1259
01:31:17.148 --> 01:31:18.886
Oh, you people.

1260
01:31:18.919 --> 01:31:22.158
Always think it's personal.

1261
01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:25.899
Making it personal
is how you got caught.

1262
01:31:27.435 --> 01:31:28.972
When your friends

1263
01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:32.279
have done bad things
to good people.

1264
01:31:33.313 --> 01:31:35.217
Feeding with one hand,

1265
01:31:35.251 --> 01:31:38.157
slitting throats
with the other. Well...

1266
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:39.961
Me and my pals,

1267
01:31:40.963 --> 01:31:43.668
we do bad things to bad people.

1268
01:31:45.003 --> 01:31:46.306
Like you.

1269
01:31:47.575 --> 01:31:49.178
How noble,

1270
01:31:49.212 --> 01:31:51.617
but the people
I work for are untouchable.

1271
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:53.955
We just released
their names online.

1272
01:31:53.989 --> 01:31:56.126
Consider them touched.

1273
01:31:56.158 --> 01:31:58.196
Why not just blow them
all up at the club?

1274
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:00.134
Kill everyone.

1275
01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:02.305
Dead men walk, money talks.

1276
01:32:02.337 --> 01:32:05.510
Alive, the money trail,
the panic,

1277
01:32:05.544 --> 01:32:07.983
leads us to friends
in higher places.

1278
01:32:09.585 --> 01:32:11.389
How did you pull this off?

1279
01:32:11.422 --> 01:32:13.327
Doesn't matter.

1280
01:32:15.331 --> 01:32:18.973
Found out you were skimming
homeless veterans from shelters.

1281
01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.080
So I volunteered in one.

1282
01:32:23.112 --> 01:32:25.551
And I waited for your
boys to come shopping.

1283
01:32:26.786 --> 01:32:30.227
After the bruising
I gave his ego,

1284
01:32:30.261 --> 01:32:32.098
I knew Hot Lips would
run to Serena

1285
01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:34.502
at the first
opportunity of revenge.

1286
01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:39.679
Hot or not, those loose
lips sink ships.

1287
01:32:39.712 --> 01:32:42.552
He overheard a private chat
with me and Chrissy.

1288
01:32:42.585 --> 01:32:45.691
I knew Serena would
do what you taught her.

1289
01:32:45.724 --> 01:32:48.431
I don't tolerate liars
never have never will.

1290
01:32:48.463 --> 01:32:50.734
All I ask is
you don't lie to me.

1291
01:32:50.768 --> 01:32:54.242
It's the one rule we all live
by at the Knuckledust family.

1292
01:32:54.274 --> 01:32:58.283
Don't break that first
rule or we break you, then...

1293
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:06.532
We have eyes
and ears everywhere.

1294
01:33:12.511 --> 01:33:14.423
...my old school friend,
Woman of the Year,

1295
01:33:14.449 --> 01:33:16.453
Chief Inspector
Katherine Keaton.

1296
01:33:19.526 --> 01:33:21.463
Chrissy's death
gives me a plausible reason

1297
01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:22.699
to go on a rampage.

1298
01:33:23.901 --> 01:33:27.341
I kill the CCTV
and everyone inside.

1299
01:33:28.543 --> 01:33:29.879
Except for Serena.

1300
01:33:29.913 --> 01:33:31.550
Hickshill Police Department.

1301
01:33:31.582 --> 01:33:33.154
My name is Serena Marcos.

1302
01:33:33.187 --> 01:33:34.723
I run Club Knuckledust with...

1303
01:33:34.755 --> 01:33:36.425
he's here.

1304
01:33:39.498 --> 01:33:41.669
One of my pals keeps
his good eye on Serena,

1305
01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:44.910
whilst another pal
puts all eyes on me.

1306
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:54.296
Police! Please, freeze!

1307
01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:57.701
- Drop MacCready clues using his two Achilles heels.
- R.M.

1308
01:33:57.734 --> 01:33:59.705
The pride of his father's
military service

1309
01:33:59.739 --> 01:34:01.945
and any pretty woman.

1310
01:34:05.017 --> 01:34:06.853
We feed Redmond info,

1311
01:34:06.885 --> 01:34:10.227
which bolsters the truth
of my story.

1312
01:34:12.431 --> 01:34:13.867
To you.

1313
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:16.975
So really believe
every lie that leaves my lips.

1314
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.451
But people have seen you.

1315
01:34:22.485 --> 01:34:23.955
You all exist.

1316
01:34:23.988 --> 01:34:25.558
They'll look for you.

1317
01:34:26.558 --> 01:34:28.965
Oh, we're dead.

1318
01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:31.669
It's amazing what
you can achieve with a jeep,

1319
01:34:31.703 --> 01:34:34.943
semtex and three dead bodies
slipped out an S&M gear.

1320
01:34:34.977 --> 01:34:36.847
People will remember you.

1321
01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.051
Police chief
runs human trafficking

1322
01:34:39.084 --> 01:34:41.389
and drug dealing fight club.

1323
01:34:41.423 --> 01:34:43.793
Bigger story than dead soldier.

1324
01:34:43.827 --> 01:34:46.967
They die every day.
Nobody cares.

1325
01:34:48.102 --> 01:34:49.639
They should.

1326
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:52.445
But they don't.

1327
01:34:53.879 --> 01:34:57.021
My dad always said never
mix business and pleasure.

1328
01:34:59.892 --> 01:35:02.031
I was an old fool.

1329
01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:05.404
Thinking something
so beautiful could love...

1330
01:35:06.606 --> 01:35:07.909
This.

1331
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:11.683
Oh, she loved you.

1332
01:35:11.715 --> 01:35:14.890
She only turned when she saw how
easy it was for you to kill her.

1333
01:35:28.417 --> 01:35:29.953
This accent.

1334
01:35:31.890 --> 01:35:33.928
Like a cigarette after quitting.

1335
01:35:35.764 --> 01:35:40.141
You know it's gonna kill you,
but I feel so damn good.

1336
01:35:42.844 --> 01:35:44.683
When did you know it was me?

1337
01:35:46.186 --> 01:35:48.724
Hooper went in knowing
it was someone in your unit.

1338
01:35:48.756 --> 01:35:50.794
He linked you to Serena.

1339
01:35:51.929 --> 01:35:53.966
We had to turn
you against each other.

1340
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.905
What was the relationship?

1341
01:35:55.937 --> 01:35:58.644
Mother-daughter? That's hard.

1342
01:35:59.678 --> 01:36:01.482
Purely business, it's easier.

1343
01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:03.853
Lovers?

1344
01:36:03.886 --> 01:36:05.424
We went old school.

1345
01:36:06.125 --> 01:36:07.729
Jealousy always plays.

1346
01:36:09.499 --> 01:36:12.172
I promised myself I wouldn't
let emotions rule over me.

1347
01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:18.717
My dad moved us to East London

1348
01:36:18.749 --> 01:36:21.689
from East Kilbride
after Mom left.

1349
01:36:21.722 --> 01:36:24.563
He promised me
it was for a better life.

1350
01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:28.035
But he always broke
his promises.

1351
01:36:30.641 --> 01:36:33.547
My dad was just
trying to protect me

1352
01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:36.620
by hiding in plain sight.

1353
01:36:36.652 --> 01:36:38.754
Which was a technique
that stood me in good stead

1354
01:36:38.756 --> 01:36:40.160
for what was to come.

1355
01:36:42.864 --> 01:36:45.204
A wolf in cop's clothing.

1356
01:36:48.610 --> 01:36:52.050
A bit like me, my dad had
an eye for the ladies.

1357
01:36:58.228 --> 01:37:01.101
And Eleanor Smythe-Keaton
was a lady.

1358
01:37:01.135 --> 01:37:04.309
I would wait outside while
he paid her visits

1359
01:37:04.341 --> 01:37:06.879
to fix her plumbing.

1360
01:37:06.913 --> 01:37:10.654
She was only one of his girls
that took the time to speak to me.

1361
01:37:10.686 --> 01:37:12.724
Couldn't have kids of her own.

1362
01:37:13.359 --> 01:37:15.797
So she took me in.

1363
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:19.771
I took my opportunity
to reinvent myself.

1364
01:37:19.805 --> 01:37:22.077
Learn the ways
of the prim and proper

1365
01:37:22.110 --> 01:37:24.382
at private school.

1366
01:37:24.414 --> 01:37:28.923
I came into contact with more
criminals inside those hallowed walls

1367
01:37:28.957 --> 01:37:30.995
than I ever did with my Dad.

1368
01:37:32.797 --> 01:37:35.737
To those who have everything,
more will be given.

1369
01:37:35.771 --> 01:37:39.078
From those who have nothing,
everything will be taken.

1370
01:37:40.079 --> 01:37:41.850
My school motto.

1371
01:37:42.851 --> 01:37:44.689
Why a copper?

1372
01:37:46.726 --> 01:37:48.764
I wasn't dirty
enough for politics.

1373
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:55.143
So you and Serena never...

1374
01:37:57.313 --> 01:37:59.685
Never.

1375
01:37:59.719 --> 01:38:02.858
That story with the sex, the...

1376
01:38:02.890 --> 01:38:06.999
Believe half of what you see,
and none of what you hear, ma'am.

1377
01:38:07.032 --> 01:38:10.406
You've taken everything
from me, Brodie.

1378
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.713
Is your real name even Brodie?

1379
01:38:17.453 --> 01:38:20.326
Now I'll never learn
what your real name is.

1380
01:38:22.864 --> 01:38:26.472
I can't believe you
came up here without a weapon.

1381
01:38:27.841 --> 01:38:28.943
Oh, I didn't.

1382
01:38:31.882 --> 01:38:33.219
What the...

1383
01:38:49.351 --> 01:38:51.188
Who are you? Hmm?

1384
01:39:01.309 --> 01:39:02.912
Wake up.

1385
01:39:04.881 --> 01:39:06.117
Wake up!

1386
01:39:07.588 --> 01:39:09.259
You're famous.

1387
01:39:11.094 --> 01:39:12.195
So sorry.

1388
01:39:13.097 --> 01:39:14.935
You're fucked.

1389
01:39:14.969 --> 01:39:16.204
Sorry I ever loved you.

1390
01:39:29.162 --> 01:39:30.566
I'll deal with the paperwork.

1391
01:39:30.599 --> 01:39:33.005
Go home to your wife
and I'll sort things out.

1392
01:39:33.037 --> 01:39:34.975
Nah,
I'll head back to the station,

1393
01:39:35.008 --> 01:39:36.979
have a little chat
with our former boss.

1394
01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:39.384
It's a big case,
I wanna get to the bottom of it.

1395
01:39:39.418 --> 01:39:42.859
Besides, Donna's always telling me
I can't let go of the little things.

1396
01:39:46.031 --> 01:39:47.401
Guess she's wrong again.

1397
01:39:56.184 --> 01:39:57.588
Is it done?

1398
01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:59.958
He's down. Finally.

1399
01:39:59.992 --> 01:40:01.227
Listen, I'm,

1400
01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:03.198
I'm sorry
I've been harsh tonight.

1401
01:40:03.231 --> 01:40:04.903
Do you forgive me, Big Trouble?

1402
01:40:06.104 --> 01:40:07.707
Of course, Little China.

1403
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:09.412
As Old Jack always says...

1404
01:40:12.583 --> 01:40:14.388
What the hell?

1405
01:40:27.046 --> 01:40:28.750
Their names are out in the open.

1406
01:40:28.782 --> 01:40:30.386
They've nowhere left to hide.

1407
01:40:34.394 --> 01:40:36.399
Now the real hunt begins.

1408
01:40:55.469 --> 01:40:59.209
♪ Princes watch paupers
ding ding in the ring ♪

1409
01:40:59.243 --> 01:41:00.814
♪ Shackled wrists
