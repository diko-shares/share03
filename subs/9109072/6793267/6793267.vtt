1
00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:45.015
How is it downstairs, Father?

2
00:03:45.098 --> 00:03:47.017
As above, so below.

3
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.394
Busy and bloody, my child.

4
00:03:49.478 --> 00:03:51.313
Just how I like it father.

5
00:03:59.404 --> 00:04:01.907
"Fifty year old
well-hung bear

6
00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:06.328
plays blank
to make you unload."

7
00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:11.709
- What's this game again?
- "Fill my hole."

8
00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:15.921
I read a blurb from
the phone sex line in
this erotic literature.

9
00:04:16.004 --> 00:04:17.631
Phone sex line still exist?

10
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:19.592
Yeah. I know.
It's so 80's.

11
00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:23.428
So would you want
me to do again?

12
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.139
Guess the missing word.

13
00:04:26.223 --> 00:04:28.809
"Filling my hole"
in the sentence?

14
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.269
And the joke works
on two levels.

15
00:04:31.353 --> 00:04:32.855
Barely works on one.

16
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.652
So?

17
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.781
Well-hung bear plays...

18
00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.494
Um... keytar?

19
00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.465
-A keytar?
-It's a keyboard
you play like a guitar.

20
00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:03.176
-That a euphemism.
-No, it's an instrument.

21
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.389
-Why a keytar?
-Well, you said it was 80's.

22
00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:11.309
No... I feel like I'm chairing
an Alzheimer's Anonymous meeting

23
00:05:11.393 --> 00:05:13.812
surely that would just be
an Anonymous, Anonymous meeting.

"No," as my father taught me,

104
00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:02.012
is the last word
I hear from dead men.

00:12:02.095 --> 00:12:03.513
Yes, Mr. Requin.

106
00:12:03.596 --> 00:12:06.141
No is a word I imagine
people want

107
00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:09.352
to say to you
a great deal, Junior.

108
00:12:10.645 --> 00:12:13.148
It's just you don't
want to hear it.

00:12:25.368 --> 00:12:26.619

truth once from a woman.

00:12:33.501 --> 00:12:36.463
I'm only interested
in you for the money.

117
00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:39.757

against expenditure.

118
00:12:41.384 --> 00:12:44.179
You give us disposable men
to fight to their deaths,

119
00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:46.514
I give you disposable income

120
00:12:46.598 --> 00:12:49.809
to pay for the women who'd
rather be dead than touch you.

121
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:56.649
I can give men, women,
boys, and girls.

122
00:12:58.193 --> 00:12:59.819
I need fighting age men.

123
00:12:59.902 --> 00:13:01.529
Military background a plus

124
00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:04.241
and nobody who will miss
them when they're gone.

125
00:13:05.575 --> 00:13:06.951
You have balls.

126
00:13:07.035 --> 00:13:09.037
Balls break. I don't.

127
00:13:11.248 --> 00:13:13.166
Your anonymity is guaranteed.

128
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.503
Nobody knows the names of
the clients but me and my boss.

129
00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:19.506
Nobody knows the password
to get to the names but me.

a code of conduct.

132
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.727
How will a man who can't
kill on request,

133
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.063
die on request? Hmm?

134
00:13:35.813 --> 00:13:37.232
We have leverage.

135
00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:40.693
He'll go down on the third.

136
00:13:40.777 --> 00:13:42.529
If he lasts that long.

137
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.907
Rawbone does not hold back.

138
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.244
So Hard Eight has to cling
on for three long rounds.

139
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.372
Where did you find Rawbone?

140
00:13:56.543 --> 00:13:58.211
My father.

141
00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:00.755
He won him in a game of cards
and loaned him to me.

142
00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:05.177
I told father I would bring
him back in one piece.

143
00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:07.929

We have eyes
and ears everywhere.

161
00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:47.297
In the beginning
I asked you a question.

162
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.924
Is there anyone who would
miss you if you went missing?

163
00:16:50.007 --> 00:16:51.718
You said no.

164
00:16:53.678 --> 00:16:55.430
You made a decision to lie,

165
00:16:56.889 --> 00:16:59.225
and now you get to make
one last decision.

166
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:02.604
You die...

167
00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:04.731
or she dies.

168
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.990
These names,
all people I killed.

169
00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.912
I have a place for
your name right here.

170
00:18:02.955 --> 00:18:04.416
Oh yeah,

171
00:18:04.499 --> 00:18:06.250
need me to spell it for you?

172
00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.087
Yeah!

173
00:18:32.735 --> 00:18:34.195
Don't kill the guests.

174
00:18:43.287 --> 00:18:45.832

00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:47.584
Hard Eight dies by your hand.

176
00:19:04.266 --> 00:19:06.644
Ow, you--

177
00:19:06.728 --> 00:19:08.730

-Police, open up.

00:19:13.275 --> 00:19:15.612
We've heard reports of screams
coming from your flat.

181
00:19:15.695 --> 00:19:18.239
Screams? Haven't heard
any screams.

182
00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.992
-But you will.
-P-Please.

183
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.213
Please don't.

184
00:19:34.296 --> 00:19:36.132
No, no, please.

185
00:19:36.215 --> 00:19:37.800
Please don't shoot.

186
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:45.391
Is the bitch dead?

187
00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:51.648
All right. I thought
you were happy.

188
00:19:51.731 --> 00:19:53.357
No, I understand.
You're not happy.

189
00:19:54.942 --> 00:19:56.861
Hard Eight isn't getting past...

190
00:19:58.112 --> 00:19:59.447
What?

191
00:20:03.117 --> 00:20:06.162
We have men waiting for him.
Don't worry. I'll fix this.

192
00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:08.414
I love you.

193
00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:13.044
Mm-hmm, I want my money back.

194
00:20:13.127 --> 00:20:15.379
Money I bet,
money I should have won.

195
00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:18.550
-Please, Mr. Requin--
-Shut your mouth.

196
00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:21.218
You made me break
my promise to my father

197
00:20:21.302 --> 00:20:23.262
that I would bring
him back in one piece.

198
00:20:23.345 --> 00:20:25.431
Well technically,
that's still true.

199
00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:27.809
I'll have to pay for a funeral.

200
00:20:27.892 --> 00:20:31.228
You know what a coffin
this size costs? Hmm?

201
00:20:31.312 --> 00:20:34.106
You steal my money,
you make me a liar.

202
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.568
Give me one good reason why

203
00:20:36.651 --> 00:20:39.987
I shouldn't have Tick Tock here
rip your fucking heart out.

204
00:20:44.867 --> 00:20:46.160
There's two.

205
00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:48.746
My knees ache.

206
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:52.041
The cramps churn.

207
00:20:52.124 --> 00:20:54.251
I just want to crawl up
into a ball and...

208
00:20:55.377 --> 00:20:57.421
Now you're getting it.

209
00:20:57.505 --> 00:20:59.507
The bleeding seems never-ending.

210
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:03.761
The dull pain in the lower
back is constant.

211
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.304
Every once in a while...

212
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:11.435
Shooting pains.

213
00:21:12.937 --> 00:21:15.898
And the headaches,
brutal, right?

214
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.987
I recommend a painkiller
and a good, long sleep.

215
00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:28.911
Sweet dreams.

216
00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:36.544
Now what do we do with you?

217
00:21:42.258 --> 00:21:43.509
Fuck.

218
00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:45.928
I'd like to reopen
the negotiations.

219
00:22:04.781 --> 00:22:06.365
I know the business.

220
00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:10.411
I know what you need.

221
00:22:12.288 --> 00:22:13.956
Settle your spurs a mo, cowboy.

222
00:22:18.836 --> 00:22:20.546
It's Hard Eight dead?

223
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.132
No, but your boys are.

224
00:22:23.215 --> 00:22:24.926
And you'll be joining them soon.

225
00:22:25.009 --> 00:22:26.803
You shouldn't have
killed Chrissy.

226
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.555
See you soon, Serena.

227
00:22:30.848 --> 00:22:32.558
Jeremiah, tell everybody
to be cocked,

228
00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:34.476
locked and ready
to rock.

229
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.937
Hard Eight's on his way back.

230
00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:38.940
It's gonna be
a fun night.

231
00:23:03.089 --> 00:23:04.423
Ass!

232
00:23:04.506 --> 00:23:07.677
Ugh, through the...

233
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.474
Stop fucking jiggling.

234
00:23:18.229 --> 00:23:19.396
Muppet.

235
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.566
Now I can't sit in the front.

236
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.526
Win for me.

237
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.029
Nice, looks like we're
the first ones on the scene.

238
00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:28.572
How can we be here first?

239
00:23:28.656 --> 00:23:30.950
Redmond told us
to join her here.

240
00:23:31.033 --> 00:23:33.285
Hooper, I know you've
only been with us a month, mate.

241
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:35.121
But if you're going to
go out in the field with me

242
00:23:35.204 --> 00:23:37.331
you have to expect
the unexpected, all right?

243
00:23:37.414 --> 00:23:41.002
Watch me. Soak in my experience.

244
00:23:41.085 --> 00:23:43.087
You'll go far in
this world, son.

245
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.797
Your wife will have to sit
in the back now as well.

246
00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:46.590
Another win.

247
00:23:46.674 --> 00:23:48.300
Been married two years, Hooper,
you know what that means?

248
00:23:48.384 --> 00:23:50.219
Third time lucky, she's the one.

249
00:23:50.302 --> 00:23:53.973
It means if I'm lucky, I get one
chance at sex once, once a week.

250
00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:56.558
Guess which night I get dragged
out on a last-minute raid?

251
00:23:56.642 --> 00:23:58.435
Tonight. Was your wife annoyed?

252
00:23:58.519 --> 00:24:00.730
I don't know. She's at her
cooking class tonight.

253
00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:09.155
All right Redmond?

254
00:24:09.238 --> 00:24:11.115
This is a fucking raid,
you Muppets.

255
00:24:11.198 --> 00:24:13.492
Me and the SWAT unit are
parked on the corner,

256
00:24:13.575 --> 00:24:14.911
not realizing that
you two knobbers

257
00:24:14.994 --> 00:24:16.328
were announcing our arrival.

258
00:24:16.412 --> 00:24:17.830
Fucking move!

259
00:24:23.002 --> 00:24:25.629
I liked her a lot better
before she quit smoking.

260
00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:29.133
Detective MacCready,
didn't hear you arrived.

261
00:24:29.216 --> 00:24:30.885
Comedy Bob, comedy.

262
00:24:30.968 --> 00:24:33.179
Right, on one we ran the door.

263
00:24:36.724 --> 00:24:38.810
Three, two, one.

264
00:24:40.102 --> 00:24:41.478
One.

265
00:24:42.188 --> 00:24:43.522
One!

266
00:24:43.605 --> 00:24:45.149
Where's the fucking ram?

267
00:24:45.232 --> 00:24:47.109
We didn't bring the fucking ram.

268
00:24:47.193 --> 00:24:50.112
-You forgot the ram?
-We didn't bring the ram,
Mam, Ma'am.

269
00:24:50.196 --> 00:24:52.531
- Ram mam.
- Stop saying fucking ram.

270
00:24:52.614 --> 00:24:54.951
We didn't bring the metal,
pushy, door-open device.

271
00:24:55.034 --> 00:24:56.994
-Just say ram.
-He said don't say ram.

272
00:24:57.078 --> 00:24:58.454
I'm ram you, you fucking...

273
00:24:59.747 --> 00:25:01.582
You didn't say you
had bolt cutters.

274
00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:03.835
You can ask for bolt cutters.
You asked for a ram.

275
00:25:03.918 --> 00:25:07.463
It's super specific man.
Ran the fucking door.

276
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:29.235
There is CCTV, Redmond,
but it's fried.

277
00:25:29.318 --> 00:25:31.528
Need Hooper to
come work his magic.

278
00:25:31.612 --> 00:25:34.281
But before I can do that,
he wants me to come back
up to the fifth floor.

279
00:25:34.365 --> 00:25:36.242
He thinks he's found something.

280
00:25:44.458 --> 00:25:46.002
Police! Please freeze!

281
00:25:46.085 --> 00:25:47.920
You have the right
to remain silent

282
00:25:48.004 --> 00:25:49.797
anything you say can
and will be used against

283
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.548
you in a court of law.

284
00:25:51.632 --> 00:25:53.509
Did you say "please freeze"?

285
00:26:01.558 --> 00:26:03.310
I'll be back.

286
00:26:04.478 --> 00:26:05.604
Mug.

287
00:26:10.442 --> 00:26:12.278
Not a word.

288
00:26:12.361 --> 00:26:14.405
And I need him talking before
Keaton hears about this raid.

289
00:26:14.488 --> 00:26:16.073
The Chief Inspector's very late.

290
00:26:16.157 --> 00:26:17.909
-Oh, have you not seen
the news tonight?
-No.

291
00:26:17.992 --> 00:26:20.828
The mayor's given
her another award.

292
00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.497
- ...revered for her work.
- Woman of the year or some shit.

293
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.209
Please be upstanding for
my old school friend.

294
00:26:27.293 --> 00:26:31.047
Woman of the Year, Chief
Inspector Katherine Keaton.

295
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.714
I made an
important breakthrough.

296
00:26:33.715 --> 00:26:35.759
Hm, what's that on his arm?

297
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.266
I know what that is.

298
00:26:42.349 --> 00:26:44.768
Saying nothing,
sometimes says the most.

299
00:26:45.978 --> 00:26:47.563
Hooper, in with me.

300
00:26:47.646 --> 00:26:49.398
Me, in? No. Why?

301
00:26:49.481 --> 00:26:50.441
I need a bad cop.

302
00:26:50.524 --> 00:26:52.026
Am I a bad cop?

303
00:26:52.109 --> 00:26:53.945
Yes.

304
00:26:54.028 --> 00:26:56.197
-Redmond, grab me
his evidence bag.
-Of course.

305
00:26:59.158 --> 00:27:01.994
This silence is gonna make you
a very popular boy on D Wing.

306
00:27:02.078 --> 00:27:03.537
What are you doing?

307
00:27:06.123 --> 00:27:08.334
You can see from his attempt
at interrogation

308
00:27:08.417 --> 00:27:11.295
my colleague is not here
to intimidate you physically.

309
00:27:11.378 --> 00:27:14.006
He cannot kick seven bells
of shit out of you.

310
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.300
Not like I could.

311
00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:18.427
Not like they will inside.

312
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.139
He won't outsmart you,
he has no wit, zero charm.

313
00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:24.225
He will never get
the girl at party.

314
00:27:24.308 --> 00:27:27.061
He will never get invited to
a party where there are girls.

315
00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:30.982
What he understands
is computers.

316
00:27:32.108 --> 00:27:33.150
Loves 'em.

317
00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:37.989
He's going to retrieve
the footage that proves you

318
00:27:38.072 --> 00:27:39.865
created tonight's corpses.

319
00:27:39.949 --> 00:27:41.867
Actually that's what
I came in to tell you, Mac.

320
00:27:41.951 --> 00:27:45.496
I've recovered fragments
of the CCTV feed.

321
00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:46.956
Bro.

322
00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:50.667
What's with all the banging?

323
00:27:50.751 --> 00:27:52.628
I'm being the bad cop.

324
00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:54.130
At least you're consistent.

325
00:27:55.547 --> 00:27:56.924
Just trying to...

326
00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:17.653
-Congratulations, Ma'am.
-Fuck off.

327
00:28:17.736 --> 00:28:19.613
Why didn't you call me?

328
00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:21.240
I was taking initiative, ma'am.

329
00:28:21.323 --> 00:28:23.742
You're taking
the piss, Sergeant.

330
00:28:23.825 --> 00:28:25.411
Give me the run down.

331
00:28:25.494 --> 00:28:27.329
A 999 call gave us
the address,

332
00:28:27.413 --> 00:28:28.956
the place we've
been searching for.

333
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.958
By the time we got there,
everyone was dead.

334
00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:32.501
All except one.

335
00:28:32.584 --> 00:28:34.836
No name, no prints
in the system.

336
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.214
-Just carrying a door key and--
-Who called it in?

337
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:39.508
A Serena Marcos.

338
00:28:39.591 --> 00:28:41.510
Serena Marcos?

339
00:28:41.593 --> 00:28:42.886
She here too?

340
00:28:44.305 --> 00:28:46.432
Not yet, but we're
still sifting bodies.

341
00:28:50.186 --> 00:28:51.728
Walk with me.

342
00:28:55.566 --> 00:28:57.776
I brought numb nuts
in here to show you,

343
00:28:57.859 --> 00:28:59.945
I'm not worried about
getting you to talk.
I don't need you to.

344
00:29:01.905 --> 00:29:03.449
That tattoo removal scar,

345
00:29:03.532 --> 00:29:05.159
it's an interesting shape.

346
00:29:06.368 --> 00:29:08.037
Why did you serve, Marine?

347
00:29:09.288 --> 00:29:11.248
You requested to join
my task force,

348
00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:14.043
I wanted to help a female
officer climb the ladder.

349
00:29:14.126 --> 00:29:16.795
I'm not your enemy,
I'm not your friend.

350
00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:19.423
I'm your boss.
Respect that Sergeant.

351
00:29:20.174 --> 00:29:21.717
Sorry Ma'am.

352
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.678
Disrespect me again,
you will be.

353
00:29:24.761 --> 00:29:28.224
I don't tolerate liars,
never have, never will.

354
00:29:28.307 --> 00:29:30.976
Now go get me something
I can use from the CCTV.

355
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.354
Speak, don't speak,

356
00:29:33.437 --> 00:29:36.148
I got what I need to put
you in a prison cell.

357
00:29:36.232 --> 00:29:38.775
Cell's nothing compared to the
seven levels of hell I escaped.

358
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:42.196
And that's if I go to prison.

359
00:29:42.279 --> 00:29:44.156
Oh you're going.

360
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.408
I know all I need
to know about you.

361
00:29:46.492 --> 00:29:49.286
I know more about you
than you know about me.

362
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.787
-Right-handed.
-Yeah

363
00:29:50.871 --> 00:29:53.082
-Wanker.
-Yeah.

364
00:29:53.165 --> 00:29:54.541
Wife's cheating on you.

365
00:29:54.625 --> 00:29:56.418
Yeah. How the fuck
did you know--

366
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.760
Pricks.

367
00:30:08.764 --> 00:30:10.516
Get out.

368
00:30:21.818 --> 00:30:23.654
I await your explanation.

369
00:30:23.737 --> 00:30:25.364
He wasn't talking.

370
00:30:25.447 --> 00:30:27.741
-He wasn't talking?
-He wasn't talking.

371
00:30:27.824 --> 00:30:30.161
Did the claret get him chatting?

372
00:30:30.244 --> 00:30:32.704
Oh, he was talking before that,
just not about what we needed.

373
00:30:32.788 --> 00:30:35.124
So you pulled a pencil on him.

374
00:30:35.207 --> 00:30:37.126
I did that because
he tricked Mac.

375
00:30:39.836 --> 00:30:42.173
Did you glean any useful info?

376
00:30:43.424 --> 00:30:44.508
He's a wanker.
We're both pricks,

377
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:47.219
Max wife is cheating on him.

378
00:30:47.303 --> 00:30:50.181
The tattoo he had scrubbed is,
it's military.

379
00:30:50.264 --> 00:30:52.599
If I can get a regiment
I can get a name.

380
00:30:52.683 --> 00:30:54.726
Off you fuck then.

381
00:30:57.104 --> 00:30:59.898
I knew she'd been cheating
with that chef prick.

382
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:04.528
Two years she's been
to that cooking class
and she's still shit.

383
00:31:22.463 --> 00:31:24.965
Good evening, Mr...

384
00:31:28.302 --> 00:31:30.137
Always worth a try.

385
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.181
I'm Chief Inspector
Catherine Keaton

386
00:31:32.264 --> 00:31:35.184
and I'll be conducting
your interview now.

387
00:31:35.267 --> 00:31:37.269
Since you Houdini'ed out
so easily

388
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.730
I see no reason
to cuff you again.

389
00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:41.565
No dramas.

390
00:31:42.983 --> 00:31:46.027
We can have a civilized
conversation, can't we?

391
00:31:46.111 --> 00:31:48.364
Civility ain't what
it used to be.

392
00:31:50.115 --> 00:31:53.410
Fuck off, Hooper!
Pull up his scar!

393
00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:56.079
So what is it?

394
00:31:56.163 --> 00:31:58.249
I'd bet Hooper's virginity
our boy's ex-military.

395
00:31:58.332 --> 00:32:00.209
Well, how do you know?

396
00:32:00.292 --> 00:32:01.835
He'd spunk his shorts if
a bird held his hand.

397
00:32:01.918 --> 00:32:03.504
Yeah, not Hooper, the scar.

398
00:32:03.587 --> 00:32:05.005
"R.M."

399
00:32:05.088 --> 00:32:06.965
Royal Marines Commando.

400
00:32:07.048 --> 00:32:09.092
Check military records
for those kicked out.

401
00:32:09.176 --> 00:32:12.137
Proud Marines don't
remove their tats.

402
00:32:12.221 --> 00:32:14.348
My dad showed is off
enough for me to know that.

403
00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:19.645
It probably doesn't seem this
way, but I'm here to help.

404
00:32:19.728 --> 00:32:22.022
So it's your turn to try
and connect with me?

405
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:26.943
Patience is a virtue
I hold dear.

406
00:32:28.695 --> 00:32:31.240
Was Serena Marcos
a patient person?

407
00:32:33.867 --> 00:32:36.995
Now, look what else I recovered.

408
00:32:42.668 --> 00:32:45.212
Welcome back, Judas.

409
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:48.924
I would have run,
but then traitors are never
remembered for their smarts.

410
00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:53.887
You know, when Guy Fawkes
failed to assassinate James 1st,

411
00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:56.056
he was to be
punished for treason.

412
00:32:56.139 --> 00:32:58.183
Hung from the gallows,

413
00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:01.061
balls severed, guts spilled.

414
00:33:02.354 --> 00:33:05.065
After tonight,
what you've done...

415
00:33:06.942 --> 00:33:08.319
That's too polite.

416
00:33:09.611 --> 00:33:11.863
But Fawkes was smart,
unlike you.

417
00:33:11.947 --> 00:33:14.032
Before he could be eviscerated,

418
00:33:14.115 --> 00:33:15.742
he threw himself off
the scaffold,

419
00:33:15.826 --> 00:33:17.578
breaking his own neck.

420
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:21.373
I suggest you take a leaf
out of his yellow-bellied book.

421
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:25.043
Put that metal in your
mouth and squeeze till
you feel a breeze.

422
00:33:25.126 --> 00:33:27.963
You shouldn't have killed her.

423
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.092
She had nothing
to do with this world.

424
00:33:33.009 --> 00:33:34.678
This is my world.

425
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:36.680
You brought her into it.

426
00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:39.558
This is all on you.

427
00:33:39.641 --> 00:33:41.977
You die or she dies.

428
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.187
That's the deal we made.

429
00:33:46.315 --> 00:33:48.359
You broke another promise.

430
00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:52.696
And now, you both die tonight.

431
00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:54.155
Serena?

432
00:33:55.699 --> 00:33:56.992
Serena?!

433
00:34:08.754 --> 00:34:10.547
I have an ear for guns.

434
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.049
They whisper to me.

435
00:34:15.302 --> 00:34:18.847
Do you want to know what
they are saying right now?

436
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.141
"You're talking to a gun,
seek medical help."

437
00:34:22.225 --> 00:34:25.729
"Shoot me, I'm full."

438
00:34:27.606 --> 00:34:30.651
-What if I kill you first?
-He kills you.

439
00:34:32.235 --> 00:34:33.612
Okay.

440
00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:43.038
I promised Miss Serena
60 seconds of pugilism.

441
00:34:43.121 --> 00:34:46.667
So drop your weapon
and raise your fists.

442
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.210
I guarantee when time is up,

443
00:34:50.045 --> 00:34:52.005
you'll beg for a bullet.

444
00:34:54.257 --> 00:34:57.386
Even I know never
trust a man who thinks
60 seconds is impressive.

We have money.

465
00:36:54.711 --> 00:36:56.296
Make him dead.

466
00:36:58.757 --> 00:37:01.301
Serena Marcos a friend of yours?

467
00:37:01.384 --> 00:37:04.095
Do I seem like someone who
has a lot of friends to you?

468
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:07.057
Is she dead?

469
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.394
You know, I've always
had trouble putting names
to faces. Faces the bodies.

470
00:37:11.478 --> 00:37:15.732
Ah, I'd kill to find some faces.

471
00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:17.025
We just seem to find limbs,

472
00:37:17.108 --> 00:37:20.946
torsos, skulls,

473
00:37:21.029 --> 00:37:25.158
bagged up buried like
a macabre pick 'n mix.

474
00:37:25.241 --> 00:37:28.745
Serena Marcos and her
associates at Club Knuckledust

475
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:31.039
don't let us find a body

476
00:37:31.122 --> 00:37:34.042
to give the families who've
lost a loved one some peace.

477
00:37:34.793 --> 00:37:36.837
She, they,

478
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.505
maybe even you,

479
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:41.508
slice and dice
the bodies of the dead

480
00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.760
up into tiny teeny pieces.

481
00:37:43.844 --> 00:37:45.929
Smash the teeth.

482
00:37:46.763 --> 00:37:48.724
Burn off fingertips.

483
00:37:50.183 --> 00:37:52.477
I mean, I should be in
that interrogation room.

484
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.896
I mean, I took the call.
I broke this case.

485
00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.272
I was first on scene.

486
00:37:56.356 --> 00:37:58.149
What have you done?

487
00:37:58.233 --> 00:38:00.569
I was running his prints
through a military database.

488
00:38:01.945 --> 00:38:05.574
Whoa, this is, this is
way above my pay grade.

489
00:38:05.657 --> 00:38:08.326
Hooper, can you get in?
-I'm not allowed.

490
00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:09.828
That's not why I asked.

491
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.542
Oh, okay, baby.

492
00:38:16.543 --> 00:38:17.878
Let's get this party...

493
00:38:17.961 --> 00:38:19.504
started!

494
00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:22.173
Swipe left, swipe left,
hello, swipe right.

495
00:38:22.257 --> 00:38:23.424
Match! Nice pic. Really?

496
00:38:23.508 --> 00:38:25.552
My mum took mine too.

497
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.470
Mm, fancy meeting up?
Cool, cool beans.

498
00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:29.347
I'll pick you
up at 6:00 p.m.

499
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.600
Wow, how old's your
profile picture?

500
00:38:31.683 --> 00:38:33.769
Yeah sunlight's a bitch.

501
00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:36.437
Hey, ho, hop on.
Mountain bike, five speed.

502
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:38.314
Let's get romantical
and hit dinner.

503
00:38:38.398 --> 00:38:41.026
Who needs candle light
when you have strip light?

504
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:43.361
Every morsel of vegan chicken
in that bucket

505
00:38:43.444 --> 00:38:46.156
is un-caged tofu.

506
00:38:46.239 --> 00:38:47.741
Mmm. Fancy coming to mine?

507
00:38:47.824 --> 00:38:49.367
My mum's in hospital, cataracts.

508
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.452
We have the basement
to ourselves.

509
00:38:51.536 --> 00:38:53.371
Oh, you like that?

510
00:38:53.454 --> 00:38:55.165
Oh, yeah,
slip off your firewalls.

511
00:38:55.248 --> 00:38:57.000
Your main frame is so soft.

512
00:38:57.083 --> 00:39:00.503
Oh, your password protected
security is so tight!

513
00:39:00.587 --> 00:39:03.006
Oh, yeah,
oh, not the right spot?

514
00:39:03.089 --> 00:39:04.841
Guide me, baby, that's it.

515
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:06.342
Oh, come on, that's it, baby,

516
00:39:06.426 --> 00:39:08.595
that's it, give it to me.
Yeah, oh, yeah!

517
00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:11.765
Mum! You're home early,
don't look, I can't stop.

518
00:39:11.848 --> 00:39:13.224
Keep going, that's it.

519
00:39:13.308 --> 00:39:15.476
Come on, right there!

520
00:39:25.612 --> 00:39:27.823
Now, who looks like a virgin?

521
00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:29.616
-You.
-Always.

522
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.909
Forever.

523
00:39:31.993 --> 00:39:34.245
He was a war hero.

524
00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:36.581
Yeah, "was" being
the operative word.

525
00:39:42.879 --> 00:39:44.547
Hickshill Police.

526
00:39:45.215 --> 00:39:46.507
Okay, Mr.--

527
00:39:52.973 --> 00:39:55.726
A very angry and loud
Colonel Vaughn is on his way

528
00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:58.812
to pick up Brodie
in exactly 60 minutes.

529
00:39:58.895 --> 00:40:02.148
Why would a war hero work
somewhere that killed veterans?

530
00:40:02.232 --> 00:40:04.901
Hooper send all
the evidence to my phone.

531
00:40:04.985 --> 00:40:07.445
I'm headed back to the scene.
We're missing something.

532
00:40:08.529 --> 00:40:10.156
Print Brodie's file.

533
00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:12.408
Oh, we need to warn Keaton.

534
00:40:12.492 --> 00:40:16.412
A few months back, Mac found
a forearm with a tattoo.

535
00:40:16.496 --> 00:40:20.416
the name Siobhan embedded
in the hilt of a Gaelic blade

536
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.753
above a military
regiment number.

537
00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:26.089
It led us to a sergeant
Jimmy James. Heard of him?

538
00:40:26.172 --> 00:40:29.342
Names, faces. No.

539
00:40:29.425 --> 00:40:33.054
Became homeless
after losing his wife
Siobhan to cancer.

540
00:40:33.138 --> 00:40:36.057
Depression creeped
in the back door

541
00:40:36.141 --> 00:40:39.102
that the PTSD had snuck
in and left unlocked.

542
00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:44.482
Surprises us all at some point.

543
00:40:44.565 --> 00:40:47.694
His identity led us to the fact
that the homeless,

544
00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.237
many of them veterans,

545
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.406
were disappearing
from our streets.

546
00:40:52.824 --> 00:40:54.659
I don't like it.

547
00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:57.078
These men deserve better.

548
00:40:57.162 --> 00:41:00.540
That's why I want Serena.
That's why you should help me.

549
00:41:01.457 --> 00:41:02.918
They my sympathies,

550
00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:06.296
but sympathy is not
Serena's strong point.

551
00:41:06.379 --> 00:41:08.006
I'll tell you that for nothing.

552
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:20.685
Everything on Captain
Roy Brodie.

553
00:41:28.985 --> 00:41:30.528
This isn't everything.

554
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:32.280
I found out who he is.

555
00:41:32.363 --> 00:41:34.115
You found out who he was.

556
00:41:34.199 --> 00:41:37.077
This tells me absolutely
nothing about right now.

557
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.370
We have him killing
on camera.

558
00:41:39.454 --> 00:41:41.372
Well that's better.

559
00:41:42.248 --> 00:41:43.624
Any news on Serena?

560
00:41:43.708 --> 00:41:45.501
She was alive last we saw.

561
00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:48.797
Oh and Brodie's
Commanding Officer,

562
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.800
Colonel Vaughn, will be in
60 minutes to collect him.

563
00:41:51.883 --> 00:41:54.177
How did he find
out we had him?

564
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.304
Brodie was flagged in
the military database.

565
00:41:56.387 --> 00:41:58.389
Hooper messed up, ma'am.

566
00:42:03.644 --> 00:42:05.188
Anything else?

567
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:06.940
No ma'am.

568
00:42:07.023 --> 00:42:09.192
Oh, we need to warn Keaton.

569
00:42:09.275 --> 00:42:12.195
Vaughn said as this
is a military matter
out-ranking us,

570
00:42:12.278 --> 00:42:14.489
anyone interviewing
his soldier when he arrives

571
00:42:14.572 --> 00:42:16.783
will be terminated
with immediate effect.

572
00:42:25.834 --> 00:42:28.044
No more excuses.
I give you one job tonight.

573
00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:30.088
Just man up. Put him down.

574
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.518
I told you this is my world.

575
00:42:43.601 --> 00:42:45.937
And I control everything in it.

576
00:42:53.194 --> 00:42:54.863
Fuck me.

577
00:42:57.282 --> 00:42:59.034
Nobody takes that literally.

578
00:43:16.759 --> 00:43:18.303
Let's start again.

579
00:43:19.888 --> 00:43:22.723
I'm Chief Inspector
Catherine Keaton.

580
00:43:22.807 --> 00:43:28.229
Good evening Chief Inspector.
I'm captain Roy Brodie.

581
00:43:28.313 --> 00:43:30.982
AWOL.

582
00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:32.733
Why'd you run?

583
00:43:32.817 --> 00:43:34.777
Oh, I didn't.

584
00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:36.696
Couldn't handle the pressure?

585
00:43:36.779 --> 00:43:39.032
Pressure?

586
00:43:39.115 --> 00:43:41.659
You have no idea.

587
00:43:41.742 --> 00:43:45.997
You see corpses after
the fact. Not us.

588
00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:48.917
Must be hard in the mind.

589
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.627
What you want me
to say? I'm broken?

590
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:54.505
I can't talk about it?

591
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:56.216
Nah.

592
00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:58.093
Oh, I'll talk about it freely.

593
00:43:59.094 --> 00:44:01.762
I'm proud to be a bootneck.

594
00:44:01.846 --> 00:44:04.432
I wore the blues With pride.

595
00:44:05.641 --> 00:44:07.810
Some of us come home

596
00:44:07.894 --> 00:44:11.231
and they don't fit
back in that easy.

597
00:44:11.314 --> 00:44:13.191
Makes us think that
we should have rode home

598
00:44:13.274 --> 00:44:14.859
in a body bag after all.

599
00:44:16.694 --> 00:44:19.447
It's if we even
have a home anymore.

600
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.617
AWOL meant I couldn't
work under my own name.

601
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.996
But of cash in hand,
volunteering, stuff like that.

602
00:44:27.413 --> 00:44:29.457
Some of us.

603
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.961
The streets we went away
to protect became our homes.

604
00:44:33.044 --> 00:44:35.380
Ceasing to exist anymore.
But in our...

605
00:44:38.466 --> 00:44:39.884
Their own heads.

606
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.431
It's hard.

607
00:44:47.475 --> 00:44:49.019
Hard to give orders.

608
00:44:50.979 --> 00:44:55.275
Even to yourself. When you're
so used to taking them.

609
00:44:55.358 --> 00:44:57.652
Surely you gave orders, Captain

610
00:44:57.735 --> 00:44:58.945
Many.

611
00:45:01.239 --> 00:45:04.117
And the one time I refuse
to someone dies.

612
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.537
But I can't help thinking
it was his fault.

613
00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:10.040
Whose fault?

614
00:45:10.123 --> 00:45:11.624
Major Vaughn.

615
00:45:11.707 --> 00:45:14.169
You mean Colonel Vaughn.

616
00:45:14.252 --> 00:45:15.420
Promoted?

617
00:45:16.837 --> 00:45:18.673
Doesn't surprise me.

618
00:45:18.756 --> 00:45:21.509
You know my name
he knows I'm here.

619
00:45:21.592 --> 00:45:24.262
He stopped me doing my job.
He'll stop you doing yours.

620
00:45:24.345 --> 00:45:26.056
He didn't stop you killing.

621
00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:28.016
My job wasn't to kill.

622
00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.643
It was to protect.

623
00:45:31.602 --> 00:45:32.937
The innocents.

624
00:45:34.272 --> 00:45:36.899
My regiment.

625
00:45:36.983 --> 00:45:38.651
My soldiers.

626
00:45:38.734 --> 00:45:40.403
My country.

627
00:45:42.572 --> 00:45:44.199
A country I love.

628
00:45:47.702 --> 00:45:50.871
That didn't seem to love
me when I washed back,
weary on its shores.

629
00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.167
It's war.

630
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.002
Men are supposed to die.

631
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.129
Men.

632
00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:00.465
Yes.

633
00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:03.218
Boys...

634
00:46:08.306 --> 00:46:09.807
No.

635
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.102
My queen, I fucking miss ya.

636
00:46:12.185 --> 00:46:15.105
And I'm gonna love the
fuck out of you when I get home.

637
00:46:15.188 --> 00:46:18.066
Tell my boy that Daddy
will be home soon.

638
00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:20.901
Tell him I miss him so
fucking much.

639
00:46:20.985 --> 00:46:23.613
Give him a squeeze for me.

640
00:46:23.696 --> 00:46:28.451
And, er, tell that little pea
in your belly that I can't
fucking wait to meet her.

641
00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:31.912
You always get me
through the days here.

642
00:46:31.996 --> 00:46:34.665
I miss the fuck out of you all.
So fucking much.

643
00:46:36.834 --> 00:46:37.877
Benchy.

644
00:46:41.047 --> 00:46:42.632
Is that all right, Cap?

645
00:46:44.967 --> 00:46:47.178
You love her, Private?

646
00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:49.972
Yeah, I fucking love her, Cap.

647
00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:55.770
Love, Benchy.

648
00:47:01.692 --> 00:47:03.861
Took out all the 'fucks' again.

649
00:47:05.821 --> 00:47:06.947
Thanks, Cap.

650
00:47:07.031 --> 00:47:08.824
Now fuck off, will ya?

651
00:47:17.375 --> 00:47:19.001
Major.

652
00:47:19.085 --> 00:47:22.338
Vaughn.
Promoted since birth.

653
00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:24.006
Make yourself scarce, son.

654
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.758
He didn't learn names.

655
00:47:25.841 --> 00:47:27.677
We were already bodies
on a block to him.

656
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.137
Skin statistics.

657
00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.805
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Major?

658
00:47:30.888 --> 00:47:32.307
Seeing out boys
out there without fear

659
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.891
played well with the public.

660
00:47:33.974 --> 00:47:35.476
Who did you poll?
The enemy?

661
00:47:38.604 --> 00:47:40.523
Now that's a setup.

662
00:47:40.606 --> 00:47:43.151
No soldier with a brain,
or wants a brain in their skull,

663
00:47:43.234 --> 00:47:45.778
would walk around waiting to get
zapped without a bone dome on.

664
00:47:45.861 --> 00:47:48.614
The public saw no fear on
his face, neither did the enemy.

665
00:47:48.698 --> 00:47:50.533
We're trained
not to look scared,

666
00:47:50.616 --> 00:47:52.368
doesn't mean we're not.

667
00:47:53.786 --> 00:47:55.538
The Prime Minister
has made it a priority

668
00:47:55.621 --> 00:47:57.457
to get more of these
pictures out to the public.

669
00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:58.999
Then let
her wander out there

670
00:47:59.083 --> 00:48:01.001
wearing just factor
forty and a smile.

671
00:48:01.085 --> 00:48:03.171
The PM wants to show
that we're winning.

672
00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:04.839
By losing soldiers?

673
00:48:04.922 --> 00:48:06.882
This is an order from up high.

674
00:48:06.966 --> 00:48:09.344
No, this is an order
from someone who is high.

675
00:48:09.427 --> 00:48:12.138
I won't tell my soldiers
to act in a way that'll
get them killed,

676
00:48:12.222 --> 00:48:15.558
so as a condescending prick,
who's sacrificed nothing
in their lives,

677
00:48:15.641 --> 00:48:18.269
only other people's children,
can prove to mummy and daddy

678
00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:21.397
they're king of a kingdom they
never deserved nor earned. Sir.

679
00:48:22.648 --> 00:48:24.942
I'm giving you
an order, Captain.

680
00:48:26.944 --> 00:48:28.904
And I'm disobeying it, Major.

681
00:48:43.753 --> 00:48:46.881
He ordered Bench
to go outside the compound,

682
00:48:46.964 --> 00:48:50.009
kick a ball around with
some kids for a photo-op.

683
00:48:50.092 --> 00:48:53.721
And he told them I gave
the order to go out
there without his kit.

684
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:58.726
He trusted me.

685
00:49:03.898 --> 00:49:06.317
And his last thoughts
were that I okayed that.

686
00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:09.445
That I killed him.

687
00:49:10.405 --> 00:49:11.947
He was just a boy.

688
00:49:13.491 --> 00:49:15.159
A kid.

689
00:49:15.243 --> 00:49:17.495
But Vaughn won't forget either.

690
00:49:19.038 --> 00:49:21.499
When he looks in the mirror,
he'll remember me.

691
00:49:21.582 --> 00:49:25.253
And he'll remember
Private Lee Bench.

692
00:49:25.336 --> 00:49:27.004
An eye for a lie.

693
00:49:28.673 --> 00:49:30.591
He can never un-see that.

694
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.939
Where did that come from now?

695
00:49:45.022 --> 00:49:47.358
I don't know.
I don't want to see where
anything else comes from.

696
00:49:47.442 --> 00:49:49.527
I don't want to see
where anything else goes.

697
00:49:51.487 --> 00:49:52.613
Oh, no.

698
00:49:52.697 --> 00:49:53.948
It's not over.

699
00:52:23.848 --> 00:52:26.684
Well, he's not
getting past my kill squad

700
00:52:26.767 --> 00:52:29.562
with just a dildo in a smile.

701
00:52:29.645 --> 00:52:32.815
He literally just got
past the kill squad with
a dildo and a smile.

702
00:52:35.067 --> 00:52:36.110
Touché.

703
00:52:39.572 --> 00:52:41.574
How old was Private Bench?

704
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:45.244
Seventeen.

705
00:52:45.327 --> 00:52:49.123
My son, Noah, was the
same age on his first
tour of Afghanistan.

706
00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:52.084
Is this where we bond?

707
00:52:52.167 --> 00:52:55.004
This is where I talk
to someone who understands

708
00:52:55.087 --> 00:52:58.132
why I want to help the men
your employer has you kill.

709
00:53:04.639 --> 00:53:06.181
Where's he stationed now?

710
00:53:06.932 --> 00:53:08.476
Bromley Cemetery.

711
00:53:09.727 --> 00:53:12.938
Roadside IED
on a routine patrol.

712
00:53:14.189 --> 00:53:16.358
No such thing as
routine out there.

713
00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:21.030
Where was he stationed?

714
00:53:21.113 --> 00:53:23.282
Afghanistan.

715
00:53:23.365 --> 00:53:24.659
Where?

716
00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:27.578
Kandahar.

717
00:53:27.662 --> 00:53:29.955
When did he die?

718
00:53:30.039 --> 00:53:32.291
Two years ago.

719
00:53:32.374 --> 00:53:34.293
I was there around then.

720
00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:38.464
He was only there a month.

721
00:53:38.548 --> 00:53:40.508
A month's enough.

722
00:53:42.677 --> 00:53:47.181
These soldiers' deaths
remind me of him every day.

723
00:53:47.264 --> 00:53:50.434
I couldn't save him but...

724
00:53:50.518 --> 00:53:53.813
maybe I can save them. Or you.

725
00:53:53.896 --> 00:53:55.523
I'm long past saving.

726
00:54:02.237 --> 00:54:05.199
Creating a dead son's
a bit fucking dark.

727
00:54:05.282 --> 00:54:08.035
Wow. He's still going.

728
00:54:08.118 --> 00:54:11.080
Wonder if Brodie
makes it out alive.

729
00:54:11.163 --> 00:54:14.041
-What?
-Wonder if he lives.

730
00:54:16.085 --> 00:54:18.212
It's...

731
00:54:18.295 --> 00:54:19.421
What?

732
00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.424
Fuck's sake.

733
00:54:23.759 --> 00:54:25.302
I'm getting worried.

734
00:54:25.385 --> 00:54:27.346
I got this covered.

735
00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.599
Kill squad in position.

736
00:54:29.682 --> 00:54:31.391
Jeremiah...

737
00:54:31.475 --> 00:54:32.560
do I have time
for a toilet break?

738
00:54:32.643 --> 00:54:34.937
Not now, Nigel.

739
00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.022
He's coming.

740
00:54:37.106 --> 00:54:39.483
You can go for a piss after
you kill him, all right?

741
00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:41.777
You're a kill squad,
for fuck's sake.

742
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:47.241
Would you care for
a cheeky bump Nigel?

743
00:54:47.324 --> 00:54:50.578
Not for me, mate.
Never touched the stuff.

744
00:54:51.411 --> 00:54:53.038
Surprise, cockface!

745
00:54:55.958 --> 00:54:57.877
Oh boy.

746
00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.920
-And what have you done now?
-I don't know, nothing.

747
00:55:00.004 --> 00:55:02.339
I pressed something.
Maybe. It was an accident.

748
00:55:02.422 --> 00:55:04.717
-You were an accident?
-You been talking to my mom?

749
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.927
Just get it back, fuckstick.

750
00:55:07.011 --> 00:55:08.804
18 months.

751
00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:11.015
Yes, I am surprised.

752
00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:13.267
Because mathematically
you've been

753
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:15.895
banging another bloke
for 75% of our marriage.

754
00:55:19.732 --> 00:55:21.942
You're breaking up.

755
00:55:22.026 --> 00:55:24.987
No not we're breaking up
there's bad signal down here,

756
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:26.906
I'm just--

757
00:55:26.989 --> 00:55:31.035
What. No. No, I'm probably not
going to let this one go either.

758
00:55:32.036 --> 00:55:34.163
Detective. I'm SOCO Ellen Shaw.

759
00:55:34.246 --> 00:55:36.206
I've been told you're
looking for a dead woman.

760
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:38.668
I can't
afford to be picky.

761
00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.757
The suspect you have in custody
you think killed

762
00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.884
this Serena Marcos
you're looking for?

763
00:55:46.967 --> 00:55:49.053
Well, maybe. I mean,
he's a mean-looking bastard.

764
00:55:49.136 --> 00:55:51.430
I could take him. Probably.

765
00:55:52.181 --> 00:55:53.891
You're married.

766
00:55:53.974 --> 00:55:56.018
Married, dead inside,

767
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:57.728
potato. potahto.

768
00:55:59.188 --> 00:56:01.649
I've just seen
a mug shot of your suspect

769
00:56:01.732 --> 00:56:04.610
and it matches someone that
I've already seen tonight

770
00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.320
murder scene before this one.

771
00:56:06.403 --> 00:56:09.198
Multiple GSW.
Looks like a pro hit.

772
00:56:09.281 --> 00:56:10.866
-Can I borrow this?
-Mm.

773
00:56:13.744 --> 00:56:16.455
Redmond, I think
I found Brodie's trigger.

774
00:56:16.538 --> 00:56:18.498
I'm sending details now.

775
00:56:27.758 --> 00:56:31.887
We all lie, Roy. Every day.

776
00:56:31.971 --> 00:56:35.140
To hurt others, to keep
from hurting others,

777
00:56:35.224 --> 00:56:37.351
to keep from hurting ourselves.

778
00:56:37.434 --> 00:56:40.562
Who we are what we are.

779
00:56:40.646 --> 00:56:43.273
I think you've been
lying for so long.

780
00:56:43.357 --> 00:56:46.401
You don't even recognize
yourself anymore.

781
00:56:46.485 --> 00:56:50.530
I think the proud
Soldier you describe

782
00:56:50.614 --> 00:56:56.203
yourself as would be disgusted
with civilian Roy Brodie, hm?

783
00:57:02.668 --> 00:57:04.294
Is that what you're into?

784
00:57:04.378 --> 00:57:06.881
Multiple gunshots, close range.

785
00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:11.385
Let her go, Brodie!

786
00:57:11.468 --> 00:57:13.721
I'm fine, we're fine,

787
00:57:13.804 --> 00:57:15.848
lower your weapon

788
00:57:15.931 --> 00:57:18.392
or it will be the last
time you raise it, Sergeant.

789
00:57:18.934 --> 00:57:20.102
Do it.

790
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.739
Talk to me, Roy.

791
00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:35.492
Hmm? What happened?

792
00:57:35.575 --> 00:57:38.245
I didn't kill Chrissy.

793
00:57:38.328 --> 00:57:41.791
I'm a killer, yeah.

794
00:57:41.874 --> 00:57:45.878
But I'm not a murderer.
This is all my fault.

795
00:57:45.961 --> 00:57:49.548
If I'd just gone down
on the third, died tonight,

796
00:57:49.631 --> 00:57:53.218
taken my punishment,
maybe she'd still be alive.

797
00:57:53.302 --> 00:57:56.096
No. I thought that...

798
00:58:01.018 --> 00:58:04.438
No, I thought that Hot Lips
heard me on the phone with

799
00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:06.231
Chrissy two nights ago.

800
00:58:08.901 --> 00:58:13.405
Oh, he told Serena, so she
knew I'd broken the fourth rule.

801
00:58:13.488 --> 00:58:15.115
Don't lie to them.

802
00:58:17.117 --> 00:58:20.871
And by lying,
I also broke their second rule.

803
00:58:20.955 --> 00:58:24.124
Can't be anybody waiting
for me when I get home.

804
00:58:27.294 --> 00:58:28.587
Hi.

805
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:30.214
Hey.

806
00:58:33.342 --> 00:58:36.720
So... last night?

807
00:58:37.387 --> 00:58:38.764
Last night.

808
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:43.185
Didn't we agree not
to say "I love you."

809
00:58:44.061 --> 00:58:45.312
Yet.

810
00:58:46.021 --> 00:58:47.773
Yet?

811
00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:50.150
I definitely think we
shouldn't buckle

812
00:58:50.234 --> 00:58:52.527
under peer pressure
to be one of those couples.

813
00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:54.529
We're... are a couple?

814
00:58:54.613 --> 00:58:57.241
Um, well, I mean...

815
00:58:59.201 --> 00:59:01.161
I like the sound of that.

816
00:59:01.245 --> 00:59:05.040
But you're right,
we won't be one of those

817
00:59:05.124 --> 00:59:07.334
couples who say I love
you at every opportunity.

818
00:59:07.417 --> 00:59:08.836
That's just sickening.

819
00:59:08.919 --> 00:59:12.798
Yuck! They're the worst.

820
00:59:12.882 --> 00:59:16.051
I hope this chat has cleared up
all this "I love you" business.

821
00:59:16.135 --> 00:59:19.513
So, I never ever say

822
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.765
"I love you."

823
00:59:22.432 --> 00:59:23.809
Cheater.

824
00:59:24.559 --> 00:59:26.728
Never. I Promise.

825
00:59:29.731 --> 00:59:31.984
I wish I never met Serena.

826
00:59:32.985 --> 00:59:35.362
It was all by chance, you know.

827
00:59:36.864 --> 00:59:38.448
I was bouncing at night,
was volunteering

828
00:59:38.532 --> 00:59:41.076
at a shelter in the day.

829
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.537
Happy and Hot Lips
came a visiting one morning

830
00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.664
hunting for new meat to mince.

831
00:59:45.747 --> 00:59:47.082
I asked them to leave.

832
00:59:47.166 --> 00:59:49.126
I was nice, they didn't listen.

833
00:59:49.209 --> 00:59:51.921
So, it was time to not be nice.

834
00:59:53.338 --> 00:59:56.175
They ran home
and cried to Serena.

835
00:59:56.258 --> 00:59:59.094
She wanted to meet
the man who messed them up.

836
00:59:59.178 --> 01:00:02.222
Jeremiah begrudgingly
offered me a job and...

837
01:00:04.016 --> 01:00:06.310
I needed the money.

838
01:00:09.563 --> 01:00:10.940
Going up?

839
01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:13.358
Not now, Nigel.

840
01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:18.948
Wankstain.

841
01:00:21.491 --> 01:00:23.160
Can I grab a gum?

842
01:00:23.243 --> 01:00:24.828
Don't think you're
gonna like this flavor.

843
01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:26.788
It's spicy.
Blow the head off ya.

844
01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:32.336
Hot Lips, Happy,
head back upstairs.

845
01:00:32.419 --> 01:00:34.421
You, follow me.

846
01:00:34.504 --> 01:00:36.590
Where's this Serena I'm meeting?

847
01:00:36.673 --> 01:00:39.426
That's Miss Serena
to you, Palooka.

848
01:00:39.509 --> 01:00:40.970
She's waiting for you in there.

849
01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.223
Barry.

850
01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.769
This is the final stop
on the Knuckledust tour.

851
01:00:49.853 --> 01:00:53.065
It's not pretty but
it's where the magic happens.

852
01:00:54.316 --> 01:00:56.443
What magic happens
through there?

853
01:00:58.195 --> 01:00:59.863
That's my office.

854
01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:02.032
Nobody goes in there
without an invitation.

855
01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:06.745
Bulletproof.

856
01:01:06.828 --> 01:01:08.497
Put it in myself.

857
01:01:09.456 --> 01:01:10.916
Bulletproof?

858
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.960
I'm protected.

859
01:01:13.043 --> 01:01:15.379
And as long as you work
with me, so are you.

860
01:01:15.462 --> 01:01:18.132
All I ask is that
you don't lie to me.

861
01:01:18.215 --> 01:01:22.677
It's the one rule we all live
by in the Knuckledust family.

862
01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.847
Do you have kids,
parents, siblings, pets,

863
01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:27.933
a partner, coffee?

864
01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:30.810
Why? Er, yes, please,
black, no sugar.

865
01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.813
Hey. Coffee.

866
01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:40.779
Because that complicates things.

867
01:01:40.862 --> 01:01:43.740
You lose a fight
or God forbid, you die.

868
01:01:43.823 --> 01:01:46.035
We have to make you disappear.

869
01:01:46.118 --> 01:01:49.163
We can't have people at home
missing you looking for you.

870
01:01:49.246 --> 01:01:50.497
Complicates the business

871
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.541
I got nothin', got nobody.

872
01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.626
You'll fit right in.

873
01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.590
He's deaf. And dumb.

874
01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:05.971
Good thing he's strong
or he'd be a dead dodo.

875
01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:09.308
Then he would just be a dodo.
They're already extinct, so.

876
01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:12.061
Oh, clever.

877
01:02:12.144 --> 01:02:14.021
Clever, clever science.

878
01:02:14.771 --> 01:02:16.273
Man, dick.

879
01:02:33.415 --> 01:02:35.375
First fight is Friday night,

880
01:02:35.459 --> 01:02:37.377
the bigger the betting
the more you earn,

881
01:02:37.461 --> 01:02:39.046
the more you win
the more they bet.

882
01:02:39.129 --> 01:02:40.380
Circle of death.

883
01:02:40.464 --> 01:02:41.590
I don't kill.

884
01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:44.134
Break bones, bleed blood.

885
01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.844
Spill less than the other guys,

886
01:02:45.927 --> 01:02:47.512
just keep it entertaining
that's all we ask.

887
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.266
We?

888
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:52.934
Sorry?

889
01:02:53.018 --> 01:02:54.894
You said "we."

890
01:02:54.978 --> 01:02:57.106
Oh, I meant the royal "we."

891
01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.275
Any problems, contact Jeremiah.

892
01:03:00.859 --> 01:03:02.319
Anytime.

893
01:03:02.402 --> 01:03:05.989
My number's 0800 blow me.

894
01:03:06.073 --> 01:03:08.283
You still live at home?

895
01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:10.452
-What?
-That's your mother's
work number.

896
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:14.414
It's your mom's landline number.

897
01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:17.876
Listen, I don't want
to get pig-lifted by
the boys in blue.

898
01:03:17.959 --> 01:03:20.170
Won't happen, can't happen.

899
01:03:20.254 --> 01:03:22.631
You see we have friends
in not just high places,

900
01:03:22.714 --> 01:03:24.049
but the highest of places.

901
01:03:27.344 --> 01:03:28.387
Now...

902
01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:31.473
let's give you a name.

903
01:03:31.556 --> 01:03:34.017
Something to get
gamblers gambling.

904
01:03:34.101 --> 01:03:36.478
You're implying they have
a copper in their pocket?

905
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:37.854
One of my team?

906
01:03:37.937 --> 01:03:40.732
Just one?
They have deep pockets.

907
01:03:42.817 --> 01:03:44.486
None of my team of crooked.

908
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:47.406
If they are
all still your team.

909
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:00.335
We have to stop meeting
like this.

910
01:04:01.086 --> 01:04:02.546
Ah, fucking hell.

911
01:04:04.047 --> 01:04:05.507
Which floor is this?

912
01:04:09.553 --> 01:04:10.720
Weird.

913
01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:16.393
Don't Pinter pause me.
What's weird?

914
01:04:16.476 --> 01:04:19.396
This time stamp,
it's not from tonight. It's old.

915
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:22.316
That is weird.

916
01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:23.525
Where's Ellen?

917
01:04:23.608 --> 01:04:25.694
Ellen? Don't know.

918
01:04:25.777 --> 01:04:29.114
But I'm going to follow
her suit by leaving
and not coming back.

919
01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:32.159
Bit like your first wife.

920
01:04:32.242 --> 01:04:34.035
Fucking hell,
kick me when I'm down.

921
01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:36.621
You're lucky I don't
kick seven bells of shit...

922
01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:40.542
Seven bells.

923
01:04:40.625 --> 01:04:44.504
A cell's nothing compared
to the seven levels
of hell I escaped.

924
01:06:48.169 --> 01:06:50.672
You don't just want Serena.

925
01:06:50.755 --> 01:06:55.302
You want the other half,
the royal "we."

926
01:06:55.385 --> 01:06:58.096
I'm gonna find them.

927
01:06:58.179 --> 01:07:00.807
Burn down everything
someone loves and wait.

928
01:07:02.517 --> 01:07:05.604
They'll come looking
for you in the flames.

929
01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:09.148
Where do you start
looking for someone
you know nothing about?

930
01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:14.738
There were whispers
of a butcher and his blades
on a horse and cart.

931
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:18.700
Whispers echoed loudly
from Serena.

932
01:07:20.452 --> 01:07:23.872
She took pride in regaling me
of how she learned to

933
01:07:23.955 --> 01:07:25.790
disappear the bodies
of dead fighters

934
01:07:25.874 --> 01:07:27.626
like a backdoor butcher.

935
01:07:28.543 --> 01:07:30.712
So I dug a little deeper.

936
01:07:32.714 --> 01:07:34.215
The irony.

937
01:07:40.138 --> 01:07:42.391
A walk the cobbles
working class man,

938
01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:45.477
his kid went
everywhere with him.

939
01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.354
Piss poor.

940
01:07:47.437 --> 01:07:50.106
But as many has
instilled in them back then,

941
01:07:50.189 --> 01:07:52.442
they had a true work ethic.

942
01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:55.236
Their faces got known
amongst the ruling class,

943
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.823
most of whom live without
rules and die without class.

944
01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:02.118
At those windows salivating
for scraps.

945
01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.580
At least that's what
the elite eaters thought.

946
01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:08.375
You see, this guy and his kid,

947
01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:12.754
they provided a very
unique service.

948
01:08:12.837 --> 01:08:17.216
On the face of it you saw
a normal and respectable
family business.

949
01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.345
But it was all just
a song and dance.

950
01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.472
Kid never stood a chance.

951
01:08:22.556 --> 01:08:25.642
When you're locked into
a life of secrets and lies,

952
01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:29.354
how can you ever know what
the truth truly looks like?

953
01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.316
They were putting on a show.

954
01:08:37.904 --> 01:08:39.448
Act One:

955
01:08:39.531 --> 01:08:42.325
disappear those
who had wronged the wrong man.

956
01:08:42.409 --> 01:08:46.329
He taught the kid well.
No teeth, no dental records,

957
01:08:47.121 --> 01:08:48.957
no identification.

958
01:08:53.545 --> 01:08:55.129
Act Two:

959
01:08:55.213 --> 01:08:57.841
slice and dice
with skill and precision.

960
01:08:59.384 --> 01:09:01.511
Choice cuts, sound familiar?

961
01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.680
Forearms with tattoos.

962
01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:10.311
The final act was the reveal.

963
01:09:12.021 --> 01:09:13.648
And the audience applauds.

964
01:09:13.732 --> 01:09:16.150
But the tale ended
as they all do.

965
01:09:18.778 --> 01:09:20.489
Grimly.

966
01:09:20.572 --> 01:09:23.783
They served up someone
that they shouldn't have.

967
01:09:23.867 --> 01:09:26.786
- And the kid?
- Well, the kid grew up.

968
01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:30.540
Years later,

969
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:33.627
everyone connected to
the Rag and Bone man's death

970
01:09:34.586 --> 01:09:35.879
Was wiped out.

971
01:09:38.089 --> 01:09:39.424
Rats ratted.

972
01:09:39.508 --> 01:09:41.801
Businesses burned. Arrests made.

973
01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.056
You walked into prison,

974
01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.267
you were body bagged back out.

975
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.436
Think it has something
to do with the kid?

976
01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:58.109
Each of the dead bodies had
a chunk cut out and left behind.

977
01:09:58.192 --> 01:10:01.112
Indicating who was dead.

978
01:10:01.195 --> 01:10:04.658
A tattoo, a ring finger.

979
01:10:06.242 --> 01:10:09.538
Wrapped in brown paper,
tied with string

980
01:10:10.455 --> 01:10:12.165
and left beside the body.

981
01:10:14.042 --> 01:10:16.586
Just like Daddy did.

982
01:10:21.257 --> 01:10:23.677
You're a hell of a storyteller.

983
01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.345
I really hope some
of them are true.

984
01:10:28.473 --> 01:10:29.766
So do I.

985
01:10:34.228 --> 01:10:36.272
You better have
washed your hands.

986
01:10:43.404 --> 01:10:44.447
Get in!

987
01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:49.953
What happened to you?

988
01:10:50.036 --> 01:10:51.412
Cocaine.

989
01:10:51.955 --> 01:10:53.456
No shit!

990
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.749
No, just piss.

991
01:10:54.833 --> 01:10:55.959
I couldn't hold it.

992
01:10:58.837 --> 01:11:00.964
How are you in here?

993
01:11:01.047 --> 01:11:02.507
I played dead.

994
01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.258
And then when Brodie
went to the bathroom,

995
01:11:04.342 --> 01:11:07.136
lucky bastard, I just snuck
past them and escaped.

996
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.013
-Escaped?
-Mm-hm.

997
01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:11.641
You realize you could
have gotten out of here alive

998
01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:13.935
if you'd run the other way?

999
01:11:14.018 --> 01:11:15.687
Oh, yeah.

1000
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:17.480
Never thought about that.

1001
01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:19.608
Not now, Nigel, just change.

1002
01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:21.985
You reek.

1003
01:11:22.485 --> 01:11:23.737
Go.

1004
01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:51.305
Dumbnuts better not
let him get to you

1005
01:11:51.389 --> 01:11:53.516
or I'll kill him myself.

1006
01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.394
If Hard Eight gets
to me that means you're
already dead, Jeremiah.

1007
01:11:58.062 --> 01:12:00.148
Gun up. Kill him!

1008
01:12:02.358 --> 01:12:03.902
I'm going for a cigarette.

1009
01:12:03.985 --> 01:12:05.028
I thought you quit.

1010
01:12:05.111 --> 01:12:06.696

now my birthday Berettas.

1038
01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:06.042
My Nan's gonna go mental.

1039
01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:07.043
Not now, Nigel.

1040
01:15:21.015 --> 01:15:22.683
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1041
01:15:26.062 --> 01:15:28.689
Tombstone was sat here,
right in front of them.

1042
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.244
Where's Serena?

1043
01:16:23.327 --> 01:16:24.996
She's in her fucking office.

1044
01:16:28.833 --> 01:16:30.584
Don't look at me like that.

1045
01:16:30.668 --> 01:16:33.171
You were the one that said
look in the lost and found.

1046
01:16:33.254 --> 01:16:36.090
I was pointing at
the protective gear.

1047
01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:39.010
I'm not some fucking fuckboy
fucker you can just laugh at.

1048
01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:41.930
"Oh, look at Nigel, he's pissed
himself again."

1049
01:16:42.013 --> 01:16:44.015
Unbelievable!

1050
01:16:49.103 --> 01:16:51.105
I come in here every day

1051
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:53.066
for a paycheck
that my Nan laughs at.

1052
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:55.734
I can barely afford
to rent her basement.

1053
01:16:55.818 --> 01:16:57.695
I go to the cafe for my lunch.

1054
01:16:57.778 --> 01:16:59.447
I never get
reimbursed for petrol.

1055
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:01.699
Not now, Nigel!

1056
01:17:01.782 --> 01:17:05.453
All I would like to be
is respected for my
achievements in here!

1057
01:17:06.745 --> 01:17:08.289
What do you want,
Thug of the Month?

1058
01:17:08.372 --> 01:17:10.083
A kiss from the Queen?

1059
01:17:10.166 --> 01:17:11.667
You're a hired goon.

1060
01:17:12.418 --> 01:17:14.295
We all are.

1061
01:17:14.378 --> 01:17:17.882
There's no award for a man
who defecates his own pants.

1062
01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.842
Dick of the day,

1063
01:17:19.926 --> 01:17:21.719
every day, you can have that.

1064
01:17:21.802 --> 01:17:24.222
I'm a self-employed dick!

1065
01:17:24.305 --> 01:17:26.099
I know what I'll do.
Fuck this place.

1066
01:17:26.182 --> 01:17:27.725
I'll fucking unionize. I just--

1067
01:17:27.808 --> 01:17:30.144
Not now, Nigel. It's all right.

1068
01:17:31.187 --> 01:17:32.355
It's all right.

1069
01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.070
What's he playing at?

1070
01:17:39.737 --> 01:17:41.572
It's disgusting.

1071
01:17:41.655 --> 01:17:45.034
He's always gobbling out of his
gob and sticking it in things.

1072
01:17:45.118 --> 01:17:47.745
There's loads of it
under that coffee table.

1073
01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.210
Bulletproof?

1074
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:57.171
That's not chewing gum.

1075
01:17:58.714 --> 01:17:59.757
Bollocks.

1076
01:18:30.788 --> 01:18:35.251
Is this where you deliver
a cool yet comical one liner?

1077
01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.502
Nope.

1078
01:18:40.464 --> 01:18:42.883
I didn't know I was going to do

1079
01:18:42.967 --> 01:18:45.469
when I finally had
her in my grasp.

1080
01:18:45.553 --> 01:18:47.096
I was just so...

1081
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:52.101
I could feel the bubbling
under my skin.

1082
01:18:54.645 --> 01:18:56.981
My veins coursing
with vengeance.

1083
01:19:01.777 --> 01:19:04.280
I just wanted her to feel
the pain I felt,

1084
01:19:04.363 --> 01:19:05.698
that Chrissy felt.

1085
01:19:06.365 --> 01:19:08.034
In that moment.

1086
01:19:08.117 --> 01:19:10.036
What did you do, Brodie?

1087
01:19:18.877 --> 01:19:20.338
I got lost again.

1088
01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.799
She had that ability.

1089
01:19:25.634 --> 01:19:29.513
Her siren call luring me into
the depths of hell once more.

1090
01:19:32.933 --> 01:19:36.270
I pulled her hair tightly
around my fingers.

1091
01:19:38.981 --> 01:19:40.733
A little harder each time.

1092
01:19:42.610 --> 01:19:44.028
It felt wrong,

1093
01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:45.571
it was wrong.

1094
01:19:46.864 --> 01:19:48.907
Then again, she never
liked it right.

1095
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:55.331
I loved Chrissy, but that world,

1096
01:19:56.249 --> 01:19:58.251
it was a different life.

1097
01:19:58.334 --> 01:20:00.211
Different me.

1098
01:20:00.294 --> 01:20:03.547
Like being back in battle.

1099
01:20:03.631 --> 01:20:06.800
That man couldn't possibly exist
in the real world.

1100
01:20:06.884 --> 01:20:09.137
In Chrissy's world.

1101
01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.097
I could pass off
the cuts and bruises,

1102
01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.391
but I couldn't lie next to her.

1103
01:20:13.474 --> 01:20:15.726
Touch her with blood
under my fingernails.

1104
01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.063
She could never understand.

1105
01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.856
If I'm honest,

1106
01:20:20.939 --> 01:20:22.525
I never wanted her to.

1107
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:25.861
Serena understood.

1108
01:20:26.904 --> 01:20:29.407
Serena loved that side of me.

1109
01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.160
She loved peeling
the blood dust from my knuckles

1110
01:20:32.243 --> 01:20:34.537
as we lay in bed.

1111
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.247
When did this start?

1112
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.416
I want the boss to know.

1113
01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:41.169
Every time they was with Serena.

1114
01:20:42.253 --> 01:20:44.422
I'd been there an hour before.

1115
01:20:44.505 --> 01:20:47.383
Inside her, on her, over her.

1116
01:20:49.885 --> 01:20:51.220
She loved the danger.

1117
01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.681
She loved it,
every second of it.

1118
01:20:53.764 --> 01:20:57.476
And she was open to everything,
men, women.

1119
01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:58.977
Why would she do this?

1120
01:20:59.061 --> 01:21:00.938
Serena was the face.

1121
01:21:02.523 --> 01:21:03.691
If the hammer fell,

1122
01:21:03.774 --> 01:21:05.193
she went down.

1123
01:21:05.276 --> 01:21:07.986
She felt taken advantage of.
Unprotected.

1124
01:21:08.987 --> 01:21:10.906
She hated the boss for that.

1125
01:21:10.989 --> 01:21:12.741
She tell you who the boss was?

1126
01:21:12.825 --> 01:21:14.368
No, not yet.

1127
01:21:15.828 --> 01:21:17.580
She was protecting me.

1128
01:21:18.914 --> 01:21:20.166
Why?

1129
01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:23.085
Because she loves me.

1130
01:21:24.962 --> 01:21:29.133
And I love her.
I love, loved them both.

1131
01:21:30.801 --> 01:21:33.262
I couldn't kill her.

1132
01:21:33.346 --> 01:21:35.348
She's called the police on you.

1133
01:21:40.769 --> 01:21:43.689
She's playing you,
you can't save her.

1134
01:21:43.772 --> 01:21:46.234
You're going away,
Roy, for a long time.

1135
01:21:46.317 --> 01:21:47.735
She deserves to do the same.

1136
01:21:47.818 --> 01:21:50.404
Help me talk to me please.

1137
01:21:52.198 --> 01:21:54.032
She called the police on me?

1138
01:21:54.116 --> 01:21:55.243
Yeah.

1139
01:22:00.873 --> 01:22:03.917
I want to talk to you,
only you, but...

1140
01:22:42.206 --> 01:22:44.292
Colonel Vaughn, I presume?

1141
01:22:44.375 --> 01:22:46.084
Let me show you to your soldier.

1142
01:22:48.754 --> 01:22:50.798
Serena's playing you.

1143
01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:54.552
There were no orders to
kill Chrissy except from her.

1144
01:22:54.635 --> 01:22:57.846
Think. She recruited you.

1145
01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:01.183
She's the face of the business
because she is the business.

1146
01:23:01.267 --> 01:23:03.018
She ordered the hit.

1147
01:23:03.101 --> 01:23:04.687
She's going to get
me out of here.

1148
01:23:04.770 --> 01:23:08.357
She promised.
We're taking the money.

1149
01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:10.609
and we're disappearing.

1150
01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:12.695
If she's waiting for you,

1151
01:23:12.778 --> 01:23:15.864
it's to make sure the evidence
is gone and finish the job.

1152
01:23:15.948 --> 01:23:18.784
That's why she called
us to come get you.

1153
01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:22.663
You're the last witness,
the last piece of evidence.

1154
01:23:56.989 --> 01:23:59.074
Be a hero.

1155
01:23:59.157 --> 01:24:01.952
Like Noah, Bench, Jimmy.

1156
01:24:02.953 --> 01:24:04.788
Don't let them die in vain.

1157
01:24:04.872 --> 01:24:08.542
She doesn't love you.
She doesn't love anyone.

1158
01:24:08.626 --> 01:24:11.044
She called us, set you up.

1159
01:24:11.128 --> 01:24:13.005
She send us to find you, Roy.

1160
01:24:15.466 --> 01:24:17.426
She told me
to destroy the hard drives,

1161
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:20.846
the CCTV, then come back.

1162
01:24:20.929 --> 01:24:23.599
I was supposed to have ages,
but then...

1163
01:24:24.892 --> 01:24:26.477
I wasn't expecting her
to call you.

1164
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.354
Where is Serena?

1165
01:24:30.022 --> 01:24:32.065
At the flat I shared
with Chrissy.

1166
01:24:36.069 --> 01:24:37.780
I tried to stop him, Ma'am.

1167
01:24:39.657 --> 01:24:41.700
On your feet, soldier.

1168
01:24:43.994 --> 01:24:46.664
Surely you haven't
forgotten how to salute
a superior officer.

1169
01:25:02.304 --> 01:25:04.515
You haven't changed.
But you will.

1170
01:25:04.598 --> 01:25:06.684
I've got my eye on you, boy.

1171
01:25:06.767 --> 01:25:09.102
He's our lead suspect.

1172
01:25:09.186 --> 01:25:11.480
He's your last suspect.

1173
01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:16.234
A letter of resignation will
be on your desk by 9:00 a.m.

1174
01:25:16.318 --> 01:25:21.365
I told your chimp that anyone
I find interviewing my soldier,

1175
01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:23.492
terminated with
immediate effect.

1176
01:25:24.702 --> 01:25:26.454
Is there any paperwork?

1177
01:25:26.537 --> 01:25:28.456
You can sign him
out at the front desk.

1178
01:25:28.539 --> 01:25:30.833
You have no jurisdiction here.

1179
01:25:30.916 --> 01:25:32.543
I have jurisdiction everywhere.

1180
01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:43.679
Did you, um, get any leads
from Brodie, ma'am?

1181
01:25:43.762 --> 01:25:47.433
I did. They were
always one step ahead.

1182
01:25:47.516 --> 01:25:50.185
We finally managed
to get a break

1183
01:25:50.268 --> 01:25:53.647
and my team do their
damndest to fuck it up.

1184
01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:55.733
I'm the only person
I can trust now.

1185
01:25:55.816 --> 01:25:59.194
I have one night
left in this job,

1186
01:25:59.277 --> 01:26:01.989
and I intend on
closing the case.

1187
01:26:10.748 --> 01:26:12.458
Put him down. Now.

1188
01:26:49.703 --> 01:26:51.789
Now it's Keaton's turn to burn.

1189
01:26:53.749 --> 01:26:56.752
The mobile you have dialed
has been disconnected.

1190
01:26:56.835 --> 01:26:58.045
Fuck!

1191
01:27:00.422 --> 01:27:02.966
Come on, come on, come on.

1192
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.511
This is Keaton,
leave a message.

1193
01:27:06.136 --> 01:27:07.930
Fuck!

1194
01:27:12.851 --> 01:27:14.687
Hello?

1195
01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:16.480
Keaton's in trouble.
She's not answering her phone.

1196
01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.940
She said she was
following up on a lead.

1197
01:27:18.023 --> 01:27:19.775
Get Hooper to track her.

1198
01:27:19.858 --> 01:27:22.528
Hooper's gone.
Phone disconnected,
evidence gone.

1199
01:27:22.611 --> 01:27:26.156
I think, I think he just
blew up a jeep with Brodie
and two soldiers.

1200
01:27:26.239 --> 01:27:28.241
Hooper? That bellend?

1201
01:27:28.325 --> 01:27:30.619
He's watched every step we make.

1202
01:27:30.703 --> 01:27:32.871
Acting the fool, tripping us up.

1203
01:27:32.955 --> 01:27:34.998
Now he's just tying
up his loose ends.

1204
01:27:35.082 --> 01:27:37.167
Well, we've got a few more
swimmers in their witness pool,

1205
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:39.878
so maybe one of these lads
can give us some info on him.

1206
01:27:39.962 --> 01:27:42.715
Until they do,
Keaton's on her own.

1207
01:28:07.656 --> 01:28:08.907
Brodie?

1208
01:28:11.034 --> 01:28:12.828
I've missed you baby.

1209
01:28:13.537 --> 01:28:15.163
Katherine?

1210
01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:16.373
I'm so sorry.

1211
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.335
I'm sorry.

1212
01:28:22.462 --> 01:28:24.632
Sorry I ever loved you.

1213
01:28:32.389 --> 01:28:33.849
I have to applaud you.

1214
01:28:35.893 --> 01:28:38.729
Setting up a task force
to take down yourself.

1215
01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:42.733
You, you're under arrest.

1216
01:28:42.816 --> 01:28:44.777
Serena was on the run.

1217
01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:47.154
She needed protection.

1218
01:28:47.237 --> 01:28:49.782
A mentor. A partner.

1219
01:28:51.241 --> 01:28:53.619
Some would say a royal "we."

1220
01:28:54.995 --> 01:28:56.914
You can't connect me to Serena.

1221
01:28:56.997 --> 01:28:58.540
I don't need to.

1222
01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:01.418
Serena will.

1223
01:29:02.753 --> 01:29:04.880
Cameras get everywhere
these days.

1224
01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:13.305
Katherine?
I'm so sorry, I--

1225
01:29:15.724 --> 01:29:17.225
I'm sorry.

1226
01:29:19.937 --> 01:29:22.022
Sorry I ever loved you.

1227
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:24.608
She killed me.

1228
01:29:25.776 --> 01:29:27.527
I don't believe it.

1229
01:29:31.573 --> 01:29:33.033
Password.

1230
01:29:34.534 --> 01:29:37.245
Do you understand
how high up this goes?

1231
01:29:37.329 --> 01:29:39.581
They'll kill me before
I drop a single name.

1232
01:29:39.665 --> 01:29:42.334
I'll kill you now if you don't.

1233
01:29:42.417 --> 01:29:44.586
Password to
your accounts, please.

1234
01:29:50.467 --> 01:29:52.385
You want their money?

1235
01:29:52.469 --> 01:29:56.181
We don't need their money,
but we know it hurts them.

1236
01:29:56.264 --> 01:29:58.600
Sunlight is
the best disinfectant.

1237
01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:01.394
Names in the open, they'll be
too busy with damage control

1238
01:30:01.478 --> 01:30:02.730
to worry about you.

1239
01:30:10.528 --> 01:30:12.614
Police station's that way.

1240
01:30:12.698 --> 01:30:15.492
Don't think about running.

1241
01:30:15.575 --> 01:30:18.120
Ask for Redmond or MacCready.

1242
01:30:18.203 --> 01:30:20.080
Good cops in bad times.

1243
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:33.677
I see you.

1244
01:30:35.262 --> 01:30:36.764
Now we all see you.

1245
01:30:38.015 --> 01:30:40.392
What did I ever do to you?

1246
01:30:40.475 --> 01:30:42.602
You have a good memory.

1247
01:30:42.686 --> 01:30:44.354
You remember Ben?

1248
01:30:44.437 --> 01:30:45.856
Ben?

1249
01:30:47.065 --> 01:30:49.067
Torn in half at your club.

1250
01:30:49.151 --> 01:30:51.361
Eye popped out of its socket.

1251
01:30:51.444 --> 01:30:53.655
Dead. Discarded.

1252
01:30:54.572 --> 01:30:56.742
No funeral. No family.

1253
01:30:56.825 --> 01:30:58.201
Club rules.

1254
01:30:58.285 --> 01:31:00.412
He was my little brother!

1255
01:31:01.747 --> 01:31:04.207
I don't remember.

1256
01:31:06.835 --> 01:31:10.923
I'm fucking messing.
I'm messing.

1257
01:31:11.006 --> 01:31:14.467
I always wanted to do
a "Murder She Wrote"
this is why I did it ending.

1258
01:31:18.013 --> 01:31:19.639
Oh, you people.

1259
01:31:19.723 --> 01:31:22.976
Always think it's personal.

1260
01:31:23.060 --> 01:31:26.688
Making it personal
is how you got caught.

1261
01:31:28.356 --> 01:31:29.733
When your friends

1262
01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:33.153
have done bad things
to good people.

1263
01:31:34.196 --> 01:31:36.031
Feeding with one hand,

1264
01:31:36.114 --> 01:31:38.992
slitting throats
with the other. Well...

1265
01:31:39.076 --> 01:31:40.786
Me and my pals,

1266
01:31:41.787 --> 01:31:44.664
we do bad things to bad people.

1267
01:31:45.833 --> 01:31:47.209
Like you.

1268
01:31:48.543 --> 01:31:50.003
How noble,

1269
01:31:50.087 --> 01:31:52.547
but the people
I work for are untouchable.

1270
01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:54.716
We just released
their names online.

1271
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.927
Consider them touched.

1272
01:31:57.010 --> 01:31:59.012
Why not just blow them
all up at the club?

1273
01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:00.931
Kill everyone.

1274
01:32:01.014 --> 01:32:03.141
Dead men walk, money talks.

1275
01:32:03.225 --> 01:32:06.394
Alive, the money trail,
the panic,

1276
01:32:06.478 --> 01:32:08.772
leads us to friends
in higher places.

1277
01:32:10.523 --> 01:32:12.234
How did you pull this off?

1278
01:32:12.317 --> 01:32:14.194
Doesn't matter.

1279
01:32:16.196 --> 01:32:19.741
Found out you were skimming
homeless veterans from shelters.

1280
01:32:21.118 --> 01:32:23.871
So I volunteered in one.

1281
01:32:23.954 --> 01:32:26.498
And I waited for your
boys to come shopping.

1282
01:32:27.791 --> 01:32:31.044
After the bruising
I gave his ego,

1283
01:32:31.128 --> 01:32:32.880
I knew Hot Lips would
run to Serena

1284
01:32:32.963 --> 01:32:35.423
at the first
opportunity of revenge.

1285
01:32:36.758 --> 01:32:40.595
Hot or not, those loose
lips sink ships.

1286
01:32:40.678 --> 01:32:43.431
He overheard a private chat
with me and Chrissy.

1287
01:32:43.515 --> 01:32:46.601
I knew Serena would
do what you taught her.

1288
01:32:46.684 --> 01:32:49.271
I don't tolerate liars
never have never will.

1289
01:32:49.354 --> 01:32:51.648
All I ask is
you don't lie to me.

1290
01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:55.027
It's the one rule we all live
by at the Knuckledust family.

1291
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:59.114
Don't break that first
rule or we break you, then...

1292
01:33:05.078 --> 01:33:07.414
We have eyes
and ears everywhere.

1293
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:15.255
...my old school friend,
Woman of the Year,

1294
01:33:15.338 --> 01:33:17.299
Chief Inspector
Katherine Keaton.

1295
01:33:20.427 --> 01:33:22.304
Chrissy's death
gives me a plausible reason

1296
01:33:22.387 --> 01:33:23.638
to go on a rampage.

1297
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:28.185
I kill the CCTV
and everyone inside.

1298
01:33:29.436 --> 01:33:30.812
Except for Serena.

1299
01:33:30.896 --> 01:33:32.397
Hickshill Police Department.

1300
01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.899
My name is Serena Marcos.

1301
01:33:33.982 --> 01:33:35.608
I run Club Knuckledust with...

1302
01:33:35.692 --> 01:33:37.235
he's here.

1303
01:33:40.363 --> 01:33:42.532
One of my pals keeps
his good eye on Serena,

1304
01:33:42.615 --> 01:33:45.869
whilst another pal
puts all eyes on me.

1305
01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:55.087
Police! Please, freeze!

1306
01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:58.590
- Drop MacCready clues
using his two Achilles heels.
- R.M.

1307
01:33:58.673 --> 01:34:00.592
The pride of his father's
military service

1308
01:34:00.675 --> 01:34:02.928
and any pretty woman.

1309
01:34:06.014 --> 01:34:07.765
We feed Redmond info,

1310
01:34:07.849 --> 01:34:11.019
which bolsters the truth
of my story.

1311
01:34:13.271 --> 01:34:14.772
To you.

1312
01:34:14.856 --> 01:34:17.943
So really believe
every lie that leaves my lips.

1313
01:34:21.321 --> 01:34:23.240
But people have seen you.

1314
01:34:23.323 --> 01:34:24.866
You all exist.

1315
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:26.409
They'll look for you.

1316
01:34:27.452 --> 01:34:29.913
Oh, we're dead.

1317
01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.540
It's amazing what
you can achieve with a jeep,

1318
01:34:32.624 --> 01:34:35.877
semtex and three dead bodies
slipped out an S&M gear.

1319
01:34:35.961 --> 01:34:37.754
People will remember you.

1320
01:34:37.837 --> 01:34:40.007
Police chief
runs human trafficking

1321
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.175
and drug dealing fight club.

1322
01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:44.677
Bigger story than dead soldier.

1323
01:34:44.761 --> 01:34:47.931
They die every day.
Nobody cares.

1324
01:34:49.099 --> 01:34:50.517
They should.

1325
01:34:52.102 --> 01:34:53.270
But they don't.

1326
01:34:54.812 --> 01:34:57.983
My dad always said never
mix business and pleasure.

1327
01:35:00.818 --> 01:35:02.946
I was an old fool.

1328
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:06.199
Thinking something
so beautiful could love...

1329
01:35:07.450 --> 01:35:08.826
This.

1330
01:35:09.869 --> 01:35:12.539
Oh, she loved you.

1331
01:35:12.622 --> 01:35:15.833
She only turned when she saw how
easy it was for you to kill her.

1332
01:35:29.222 --> 01:35:30.890
This accent.

1333
01:35:32.809 --> 01:35:34.852
Like a cigarette after quitting.

1334
01:35:36.646 --> 01:35:41.109
You know it's gonna kill you,
but I feel so damn good.

1335
01:35:43.736 --> 01:35:45.530
When did you know it was me?

1336
01:35:47.157 --> 01:35:49.534
Hooper went in knowing
it was someone in your unit.

1337
01:35:49.617 --> 01:35:51.661
He linked you to Serena.

1338
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:54.872
We had to turn
you against each other.

1339
01:35:54.956 --> 01:35:56.791
What was the relationship?

1340
01:35:56.874 --> 01:35:59.502
Mother-daughter? That's hard.

1341
01:36:00.545 --> 01:36:02.297
Purely business, it's easier.

1342
01:36:03.006 --> 01:36:04.716
Lovers?

1343
01:36:04.799 --> 01:36:06.218
We went old school.

1344
01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:08.595
Jealousy always plays.

1345
01:36:10.305 --> 01:36:13.141
I promised myself I wouldn't
let emotions rule over me.

1346
01:36:16.894 --> 01:36:19.522
My dad moved us to East London

1347
01:36:19.606 --> 01:36:22.484
from East Kilbride
after Mom left.

1348
01:36:22.567 --> 01:36:25.362
He promised me
it was for a better life.

1349
01:36:26.821 --> 01:36:28.948
But he always broke
his promises.

1350
01:36:31.451 --> 01:36:34.329
My dad was just
trying to protect me

1351
01:36:34.412 --> 01:36:37.415
by hiding in plain sight.

1352
01:36:37.499 --> 01:36:39.542
Which was a technique
that stood me in good stead

1353
01:36:39.626 --> 01:36:41.128
for what was to come.

1354
01:36:43.755 --> 01:36:46.174
A wolf in cop's clothing.

1355
01:36:49.427 --> 01:36:52.972
A bit like me, my dad had
an eye for the ladies.

1356
01:36:59.187 --> 01:37:01.981
And Eleanor Smythe-Keaton
was a lady.

1357
01:37:02.065 --> 01:37:05.235
I would wait outside while
he paid her visits

1358
01:37:05.318 --> 01:37:07.695
to fix her plumbing.

1359
01:37:07.779 --> 01:37:11.408
She was only one of
his girls that took
the time to speak to me.

1360
01:37:11.491 --> 01:37:13.535
Couldn't have kids of her own.

1361
01:37:14.369 --> 01:37:16.621
So she took me in.

1362
01:37:16.704 --> 01:37:20.583
I took my opportunity
to reinvent myself.

1363
01:37:20.667 --> 01:37:22.960
Learn the ways
of the prim and proper

1364
01:37:23.044 --> 01:37:25.338
at private school.

1365
01:37:25.422 --> 01:37:29.759
I came into contact
with more criminals inside
those hallowed walls

1366
01:37:29.842 --> 01:37:31.886
than I ever did with my Dad.

1367
01:37:33.638 --> 01:37:36.516
To those who have everything,
more will be given.

1368
01:37:36.599 --> 01:37:39.977
From those who have nothing,
everything will be taken.

1369
01:37:40.978 --> 01:37:42.689
My school motto.

1370
01:37:43.690 --> 01:37:45.483
Why a copper?

1371
01:37:47.527 --> 01:37:49.571
I wasn't dirty
enough for politics.

1372
01:37:52.949 --> 01:37:56.035
So you and Serena never...

1373
01:37:58.288 --> 01:38:00.457
Never.

1374
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.668
That story with the sex, the...

1375
01:38:03.751 --> 01:38:07.839
Believe half of what you
see, and none of what
you hear, ma'am.

1376
01:38:07.922 --> 01:38:11.343
You've taken everything
from me, Brodie.

1377
01:38:11.426 --> 01:38:14.512
Is your real name even Brodie?

1378
01:38:18.433 --> 01:38:21.269
Now I'll never learn
what your real name is.

1379
01:38:23.688 --> 01:38:27.442
I can't believe you
came up here without a weapon.

1380
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:29.736
Oh, I didn't.

1381
01:38:32.697 --> 01:38:34.115
What the...

1382
01:38:50.298 --> 01:38:52.091
Who are you? Hmm?

1383
01:39:02.227 --> 01:39:03.728
Wake up.

1384
01:39:05.688 --> 01:39:06.981
Wake up!

1385
01:39:08.566 --> 01:39:10.151
You're famous.

1386
01:39:11.944 --> 01:39:12.987
So sorry.

1387
01:39:13.946 --> 01:39:15.698
You're fucked.

1388
01:39:15.782 --> 01:39:17.074
Sorry I ever loved you.

1389
01:39:30.046 --> 01:39:31.506
I'll deal with the paperwork.

1390
01:39:31.589 --> 01:39:33.800
Go home to your wife
and I'll sort things out.

1391
01:39:33.883 --> 01:39:35.760
Nah,
I'll head back to the station,

1392
01:39:35.843 --> 01:39:37.762
have a little chat
with our former boss.

1393
01:39:37.845 --> 01:39:40.265
It's a big case,
I wanna get to the bottom of it.

1394
01:39:40.348 --> 01:39:43.643
Besides, Donna's always
telling me I can't let go
of the little things.

1395
01:39:46.854 --> 01:39:48.315
Guess she's wrong again.

1396
01:39:57.031 --> 01:39:58.491
Is it done?

1397
01:39:58.575 --> 01:40:00.702
He's down. Finally.

1398
01:40:00.785 --> 01:40:02.078
Listen, I'm,

1399
01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:04.038
I'm sorry
I've been harsh tonight.

1400
01:40:04.121 --> 01:40:05.707
Do you forgive me, Big Trouble?

1401
01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:08.668
Of course, Little China.

1402
01:40:08.751 --> 01:40:10.295
As Old Jack always says...

1403
01:40:13.548 --> 01:40:15.300
What the hell?

1404
01:40:27.854 --> 01:40:29.689
Their names are out in the open.

1405
01:40:29.772 --> 01:40:31.274
They've nowhere left to hide.

1406
01:40:35.278 --> 01:40:37.280
Now the real hunt begins.

1407
01:40:56.383 --> 01:41:00.011
♪ Princes watch paupers
ding ding in the ring ♪

1408
01:41:00.094 --> 01:41:01.763
♪ Shackled wrists
bloodied fists ♪

1409
01:41:01.846 --> 01:41:03.973
♪ It's all a show
for those in the know ♪

1410
