Try? I did! I had a suggestion
that we go to the police.

500
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.686
But you didn't like that,
so frankly, Louise, I'm out of ideas.

501
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.229
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?

502
00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:18.316

- Sorry.

- Darling, you all right?
- Yeah.

665
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.007
- Are you okay? Did I cause that?
- No, I'm sorry.

666
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.926
- No? You're okay?
- Uh-huh.

667
00:39:47.009 --> 00:39:49.220
All right.
Is there something I can do for you?

668
00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:50.763
- No, it's okay.
- Hmm?

Excuse me, ma'am.

673
00:40:42.356 --> 00:40:44.316
Uh, may I ask
which direction you're heading?

674
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.778
See, I'm trying to get back to school,
my ride fell through,

675
00:40:47.861 --> 00:40:50.281
and, well, I'm kind of stuck here
like stink on stink.

676
00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:52.283
So I was thinkin' that, uh,

677
00:40:52.366 --> 00:40:55.619
if you're goin' my way
or if I'm going your way...

678
00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:58.247
- I think we're going to Oklahoma City...
- Perfect.

679
00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.456
...but I'm not sure.

680
00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:02.126
Yeah, well, I'd appreciate it much.

681
00:41:02.209 --> 00:41:03.836
Um...

682
00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:08.632
Well, see, it's really not up to me.
It's not my car. Um...

683
00:41:08.716 --> 00:41:10.301
We'd have to ask my friend.

684
00:41:11.343 --> 00:41:14.680
But I... She would probably say no.
She's a little bit uptight.

685
00:41:14.763 --> 00:41:16.765
Maybe it's not such a good idea.

686
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.310
But I tell you what.
I thank you for your time.

687
00:41:19.393 --> 00:41:22.229
But, I mean, I can ask, you know.
It wouldn't hurt nothing.

688
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:24.648
Well, no, it wouldn't hurt.

689
00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:26.692

691
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:32.615
Uh, this young man here
is on his way back to school,

692
00:41:32.698 --> 00:41:35.284
and I thought since
we're going the same direction,

693
00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.745
you know, we could give him a ride, huh?

694
00:41:41.498 --> 00:41:43.250
It's probably not a good idea.

695

- <i>(Thelma)</i> Louise.
- No, probably not.

What'd Darryl have to say?

710
00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:29.838
Oh, he said, "Okay, Thelma, I just wanted
to make sure you was all right.

711
00:42:29.922 --> 00:42:31.757
I sure hope you're havin' fun.
You deserve it.

to give somebody a ride.

Darryl don't have a cute butt.

I need you to find all the secondary roads
to Mexico from Oklahoma City.

724
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:33.235
I think we should stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

<i>(Train horn blaring)</i>

726
00:43:34.611 --> 00:43:39.074
Uh, looks like we could get
on this Road 81 here

go through there.

Wait. What?

731
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:54.548
You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma,
but you don't wanna go through Texas?

732

Thelma, you know how I feel about Texas!
We're not goin' that way!

I mean, look at this map!

736
00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:09.688
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas. Look!

Thelma, I'm not gonna talk about this!

738
00:44:11.607 --> 00:44:14.943
Now, you either find another way
or give me the goddamn map and I will!

- You understand?
- No, Louise, I don't.

740
00:44:18.363 --> 00:44:21.033
Now, how come you never told me
what happened to you there?

you wanna get caught.

It looks like she maybe planned
on being gone a while.

803
00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:04.584
The strange thing is, her husband said
she would never touch that gun.

804
00:50:05.585 --> 00:50:08.421
He got it for her
'cause he's out late a lot,

but he said she'd never touch it,
wouldn't learn to shoot it.

Mr. John fucking Law.

1316
01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:43.685
Son, I got a feeling about something and...

1317
01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:46.354
- Yeah?
- ...I just wanna ask your opinion.

1318
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.651
Do you think Thelma Dickinson
would have committed armed robbery

1319
01:23:51.734 --> 01:23:53.736
if you hadn't taken all their money?

1320
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:57.699
Get your foot off that table.

1321
01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.497

No. No, I...

How you know they didn't...

1324

Don't you fucking lie to me!

1325
01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:16.885
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.

1326
01:24:16.968 --> 01:24:18.636
They had a chance.

1327
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.014
- And now you've screwed it up for them.
- No.

1328
01:24:21.097 --> 01:24:22.932
And now they're in some serious trouble.

1329
01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:25.185
And I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible

1330
01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:27.395
for at least part of it
if anything happens to them.

1331
01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:30.106
I got no feelin' for you.

1332
01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:33.234
Now, you're either gonna tell me
every damn thing you know,

1333
01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.237
so there's a small chance
that I can actually do them some good,

1334
01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.157
or I'm gonna be all over you
like a fly on shit
