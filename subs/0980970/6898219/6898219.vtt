(birds chirping)

3
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.885
(airplane engine rumbling)

4
00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.480
All right, that's it.

5
00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:06.483
(men grunting with effort)

6
00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.152
One, two, three.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:12.531
(bicycle bell rings)

8
00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.250
(low, indistinct conversation)

9
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.046
Are you sure you're 18?

10
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.590
Why? Do I look older?

11
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.516
Alberta Scrubb?

12
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.809
That's a typographical error.

13
00:01:40.893 --> 00:01:43.478
It's supposed to be Albert A. Scrubb.

14
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.232
Edmund, you're supposed to be
helping me with the groceries.

15
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:48.609
(chuckling)

16
00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:53.947
Better luck next time, eh, squirt?

17
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.039
Squirt?

18
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.499
He barely had two years on me.

19
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.876
I'm a king.

20
00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.296
I've fought wars, and...
and I've led armies.

21
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.797
Not in this world.

22
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.009
Yeah. Instead, I'm stuck here doing battle

23
00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.470
with Eustace Clarence Scrubb.

24
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.764
If anyone so deserved a name.

25
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:22.684
What are you doing?

26
00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:24.645
Nothing.

27
00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:27.147
Come on, then.

28
00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.658
<i>EUSTACE:</i>
<i>Dear diary, it is now day 253</i>

29
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.245

30
00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.539
<i>I'm not sure how much longer</i>
<i>I can cope living with them,</i>

31
00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:45.082
<i>having to share my things.</i>

32
00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.753
<i>If only one could treat relatives</i>

33
00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.672

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:55.384
<i>I could simply put them in a jar</i>

LUCY: I'm home.

36
00:02:57.469 --> 00:02:58.971

<i>MAN (on radio): That concludes</i>

40
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.484
Hello, Uncle Harold.
I tried to find some carrots,

41
00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:14.570
but all they had were turnips again.

42
00:03:14.653 --> 00:03:16.488
Shall I start making soup?

43
00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:18.657
Aunt Alberta's on her way home.

44
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.325
(coughing)

45
00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.786
Uncle Harold.

46
00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.497
EUSTACE: Father!

47
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:27.374
Edmund's making faces at you.

48
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.169
-(spits)
-Why, you little...

49
00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.880
-Father, he's gonna hit me.
-LUCY: Edmund, look.

50
00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:34.715
It's from Susan.

51
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.301
<i>SUSAN: I do wish</i>
<i>you were here with us.</i>

52
00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.804
<i>It's been such an adventure,</i>
<i>but nothing like our times in Narnia.</i>

53
00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:45.767
<i>America is very exciting,</i>
<i>except we never see Father.</i>

54
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:48.562
<i>He works so very hard.</i>
<i>I was invited...</i>

55
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.982
"To the British consul's tea party
this week by a naval officer,

56
00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.984
<i>who happens to be very handsome.</i>

57
00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:57.029
I think he fancies me." Hmm.

58
00:03:57.112 --> 00:04:00.282
"It seems the Germans have made
the crossing difficult right now.

59
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.617
Times are hard.

60
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.078
Mother hopes you both won't mind
another few months in Cambridge."

61
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:09.333
Another few months?
How will we survive?

62
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.126
You're lucky.

63
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.630
At least you've got your own room.
I'm stuck with mullet mouth.

64
00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.257
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.

65
00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:19.092
Off on adventures.

66
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.678
Yeah, they're the eldest,
and we're the youngest.

67
00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:23.889
We don't matter as much.

68
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.142
Do you think I look anything like Susan?

69
00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:29.102
(sighs)

70
00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:32.648
Lucy, have you seen this ship before?

71
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.358
Yes.

72
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.360
It's very Narnian-looking, isn't it?

73
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:38.237
Yeah.

74
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.073
Well, just another reminder
that we're here and not there.

75
00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:45.118
There once were two orphans,
who wasted their time

76
00:04:45.202 --> 00:04:47.120
believing in Narnian nursery rhymes.

77
00:04:47.204 --> 00:04:48.956
-Please let me hit him.
-No!

78
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.083
-Don't you ever knock?
-It's my house.

79
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.293
I'll do as I please.
You're just guests.

80
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.922
What's so fascinating
about that picture anyway?

81
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.924
It's hideous.

82
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.634
You won't see it from
the other side of the door.

83
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.054
Edmund, it looks like the
water's actually moving.

84
00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:07.432
What rubbish. See?
That's what happens when you read

85
00:05:07.516 --> 00:05:09.852
all those fanciful novels
and fairy tales of yours.

86
00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:11.979
There once was a boy called Eustace,

87
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:14.690
who read books full of facts
that were useless.

88
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:17.359
People who read fairy tales
are always the sort

89
00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.820
who become a hideous burden
to people like me,

90
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:21.822
who read books of real information.

91
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:23.031
Hideous burden?!

92
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:26.827
I haven't seen you lift a finger since
we've been here.

93
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:29.663
I have a right mind to tell your father

94
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.248
it was you who stole
Aunt Alberta's sweets.

95
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.833
-EUSTACE: Liar.
-EDMUND: Oh, really?

96
00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.585
Edmund, the painting.

97
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:36.378
EDMUND: I found them under your bed,

98
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.881
and you know what?
I licked every one of them.

99
00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:41.717
EUSTACE: Ooh! I'm infected!
With you!

100
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.010
(gasps)

101
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.514
What's going on here?

102
00:05:47.598 --> 00:05:49.766
-EDMUND: Lucy, do you think--
-EUSTACE: It's some kind of trick.

103
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.351
Stop it or I'll tell mother.

104
00:05:51.435 --> 00:05:54.188
Mother! Mother!

105
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.275
I'll just smash the rotten thing.

106
00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.610
No, Eustace!

107
00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.196
-No! No! No!
-Eustace, please stop it.

108
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.281
-Get off me! Get off!
-LUCY: Let go of it, Eustace!

109
00:06:04.364 --> 00:06:07.492
Put it down! Let go!

110
00:06:10.078 --> 00:06:11.830
-(grunting)
-(Lucy screams)

111
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:16.710
(gasps)

112
00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:24.301
(muffled groaning)

113
00:06:32.976 --> 00:06:34.895
(gasps)

114
00:06:34.978 --> 00:06:37.439
-Edmund!
-(gasps)

115
00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:39.149
Aah! What's happening?
What's happening?

116
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.692
(deep rumbling, creaking)

117
00:06:40.776 --> 00:06:42.110
EUSTACE:
Where are we?

118
00:06:44.488 --> 00:06:45.822
Eustace, swim!

119
00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:47.491
EUSTACE: What's going on?

120
00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:49.409
LUCY: Eustace, come on!

121
00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:50.994
EDMUND: Come on, move!

122
00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:53.247
LUCY: Keep swimming!

123
00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:56.583
EUSTACE: Edmund!

124
00:07:01.755 --> 00:07:04.216
It's all right. I've got you.

125
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:06.718
Caspian!

126
00:07:06.802 --> 00:07:09.555
-Lucy.
-Edmund, it's Caspian!

127
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:12.558
It's all right, boys. You're safe now.

128
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.269
-EDMUND: We in Narnia?
-CASPIAN: Yes, you're in Narnia.

129
00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:17.062
I don't want to go!

130
00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:19.064
I want to go back to England!

131
00:07:19.147 --> 00:07:21.191
I'm going back to England!

132
00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:22.693
Hold on.

133
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:44.339
That was thrilling. (giggles)

134
00:07:44.423 --> 00:07:46.216
How in the world did you end up here?

135
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.051
I have no idea.

136
00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:49.761
EDMUND: Caspian.

137
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:51.930
Edmund.

138
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:53.891
-It's great to see you.
-Good to see you.

139
00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.559
Didn't you call for us?

140
00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:57.895
No. Not this time.

141
00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:01.064
Well, whatever the case,
I'm just glad to be here.

142
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:02.691
(Eustace screaming)

143
00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:04.860
Don't touch me!

144
00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.196
Get that thing off me!

145
00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:09.907
(grunting, panting)

146
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.408
Reepicheep!

147
00:08:12.743 --> 00:08:15.037
Oh. Your Majesties.

148
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.206
Hello, Reep. What a pleasure.

149
00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:19.124
The pleasure is all mine, sir.

150
00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:23.295
But first, what to do about this...
this... hysterical interloper?

151
00:08:23.378 --> 00:08:26.715
(coughing) That giant rat thing
just tried to claw my face off!

152
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.928
I was merely trying to expel
the water from your lungs, sir.

153
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.388
It talked! Did you see...
anyone just hear that?

154
00:08:33.472 --> 00:08:35.807
-It... it just talked!
-He always talks.

155
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:37.392
Actually, it's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

156
00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:39.728
The moment there is nothing
to be said, Your Highness,

157
00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:42.231
I promise you, I will not say it.

158
00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:43.982
Look, I don't know
what kind of prank this is,

159
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:46.193
but I want to wake up right now!

160
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:48.570
Perhaps we could throw him back.

161
00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.739
EUSTACE: ...and kidnapped
by some sort of seafaring carnival!

162
00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:53.659
-Edmund!
-(crewmen chuckling)

163
00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:56.328
I demand to know!
Just where in the blazes am I?

164
00:08:56.411 --> 00:09:00.040
You're on the<i> Dawn Treader,</i>
the finest ship in Narnia's navy.

165
00:09:00.123 --> 00:09:02.918
-(swooning)
-(men laughing)

166
00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:07.756
Was it something I said?

167
00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.133
See to him, will you?

168
00:09:10.217 --> 00:09:11.635
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:14.513
Aw... (chuckles)

170
00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:15.764
Men...

171
00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:19.643
Behold our castaways...

172
00:09:20.936 --> 00:09:23.856
...Edmund the Just
and Lucy the Valiant,

173
00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:27.526
High King and Queen of Narnia.

174
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.348
Aslan.

175
00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:08.942
Look. Susan's bow and arrows.

176
00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:10.819
Lucy.

177
00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:15.157
My healing cordial.
And dagger.

178
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.326
Oh. May I?

179
00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.827
Of course. They're yours.

180
00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:21.038
-Peter's sword.
-Yes.

181
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.582
I looked after it as promised.

182
00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:27.836
Here. Hold it if you wish.

183
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.671
No, no. It's yours.

184
00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:31.882
Peter gave it to you.

185
00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.302
I did save this for you, though.

186
00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:42.059
Thanks.

187
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.146
CASPIAN: Since you left us,
the Giants of the North

188
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.773
have surrendered unconditionally.

189
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.025
And we defeated the Calormen
armies at the Great Desert.

190
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.569
There's peace across all of Narnia.

191
00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:55.322
-Peace?
-In just three years.

192
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.408
And have you found yourself
a queen in those three years?

193
00:10:59.284 --> 00:11:02.287
No. Not one to compare
with your sister.

194
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.373
EDMUND: Hang on.
So if there are no wars to fight

195
00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:07.751
and no one's in trouble,
then why are we here?

196
00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.671
That's a good question.
I've been asking myself the same thing.

197
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.506
So where are we sailing to?

198
00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:15.008
Before I took back the
throne from my uncle,

199
00:11:15.092 --> 00:11:19.012
he tried to kill my father's closest
friends and most loyal supporters--

200
00:11:19.096 --> 00:11:21.181
the seven lords of Telmar.

201
00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:27.187
They fled to the Lone Islands.

202
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.190
No one's heard from them since.

203
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.027
So you think something's
happened to them?

204
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:37.823
Well, if it has,
it's my duty to find out.

205
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.910
LUCY: Well, what's east
of the Lone Islands?

206
00:11:41.994 --> 00:11:43.871
DRINIAN:
Uncharted waters.

207
00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.498
Things you could barely imagine.

208
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.793
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

209
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.422
Sea serpents?

210
00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:56.466
All right, Captain.
That's enough of your tall tales.

211
00:12:01.847 --> 00:12:03.724
(crewmen shouting commands)

212
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:10.397
REEPICHEEP:<i> ♪ Where sky and water meet ♪</i>

213
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.275
<i>♪ Where the waves grow ever sweet ♪</i>

214
00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:17.446
<i>♪ Doubt not, you, Reepicheep ♪</i>

215
00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:20.574
<i>♪ To find all that you seek ♪</i>

216
00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:23.076
<i>♪ There is the utter East ♪</i>

217
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.411
<i>-♪ Doubt not... ♪</i>
-LUCY: That's pretty.

218
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.331
Aah! Ooh! Oh! Thank you.

219
00:12:27.414 --> 00:12:30.417
A dryad sung it to me
when I was just a mouseling.

220
00:12:31.293 --> 00:12:34.588
I can't divine the meaning, but, uh,
I've never forgotten the words.

221
00:12:34.671 --> 00:12:36.882
What do you think is past
the Lone Islands, Reep?

222
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.885
Well, I've been told
the furthest east one can sail

223
00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:42.596
is to the end of the world--
Aslan's country.

224
00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:44.848
Do you really believe
there's such a place?

225
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:47.893
Well, we have nothing, if not belief.

226
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:52.981
So you think you
could actually sail there?

227
00:12:53.065 --> 00:12:55.776
Well, there is only one way
of finding that out.

228
00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.862
I can only hope I will one day
earn the right to see it.

229
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:01.114
(chuckles)
Your Majesty.

230
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.023
(swords clanging)

231
00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:37.860
(jovial shouting)

232
00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:40.779
Come on.

233
00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.741
(onlookers shouting)

234
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.412
(grunting)

235
00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:59.214
(Edmund laughs)

236
00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:01.508
(crew cheers, applauds)

237
00:14:01.592 --> 00:14:03.051
You've grown stronger, my friend.

238
00:14:03.969 --> 00:14:05.470
Seems I have.

239
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.224
All right! Back to work!

240
00:14:11.602 --> 00:14:12.811
-Your Highness.
-Oh, thank you.

241
00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:14.688
(bell clanging)

242
00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:22.070
Edmund, do you think if we keep sailing
to the end of the world, we'll just...

243
00:14:23.197 --> 00:14:24.698
...tip off the edge?

244
00:14:24.781 --> 00:14:27.659
EDMUND: Don't worry, Lu,
we're a long way from there.

245
00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:30.370
I see you're still talking nonsense,
the two of you.

246
00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:35.250
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, no thanks to you.

247
00:14:35.334 --> 00:14:37.085
It's lucky I have an iron constitution.

248
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:38.587
REEPICHEEP: As effervescent
as ever, I see.

249
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.172
Find your sea legs?

250
00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:41.548
Never lost them.

251
00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:43.634
Simply dealing with the shock of things.

252
00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:47.554
Mother says I have an acute disposition,
due to my intelligence.

253
00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:50.182
I don't think he has "a cute" anything.

254
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.351
I'll have you know, as soon as we
find civilization,

255
00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:56.230
I'm contacting the British Consul.
Have you all arrested for kidnapping.

256
00:14:56.313 --> 00:14:57.940
Kidnapping, is it?

257
00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.275
That's funny.
I thought we saved your life.

258
00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:01.735
You held me against my will!

259
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.946
-Ha!
-Did I?

260
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.989
In, what I must say, are the
most unhygienic quarters.

261
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:07.658
It's like a, it's like a zoo down there!

262
00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:09.493
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?

263
00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:10.994
He's just warming up.

264
00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:12.996
Land ho!

265
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.957
(crew shouting orders)

266
00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.104
The Lone Islands.

267
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.064
The port of Narrowhaven.

268
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:42.150
Strange, not a Narnian flag in sight.

269
00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:46.071
But the Lone Islands
have always been Narnia's.

270
00:15:47.322 --> 00:15:48.699
(birds calling)

271
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.242
DRINIAN: Seems suspicious.

272
00:15:52.786 --> 00:15:54.079
I say we prepare a landing party.

273
00:15:54.162 --> 00:15:55.789
EDMUND: Drinian?

274
00:15:56.874 --> 00:15:58.917
Forgive me, Your Majesty,

275
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:02.087
but the chain of command starts
with King Caspian on this ship.

276
00:16:04.006 --> 00:16:06.383
-Right.
-CASPIAN: We'll use longboats.

277
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:08.343
Drinian, pick some men and come ashore.

278
00:16:08.427 --> 00:16:09.928
-Aye.
-Tavros.

279
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:15.309
Man the longboats, furl the sail
and prepare to drop anchor.

280
00:16:15.392 --> 00:16:16.685
(crew shouting)

281
00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.734
(men grunting)

282
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.658
REEPICHEEP: Onward!

283
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:33.785
The thrill of the unknown lies ahead.

284
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.163
Couldn't this have
waited till the morning?

285
00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:39.791
There is no honor in turning
away from adventure, lad.

286
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.418
LUCY: Listen.

287
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:43.712
Where is everyone?

288
00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:46.340
Come on, jelly legs.

289
00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:48.175
I'm capable of doing it myself.

290
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:50.969
-Oh! Aah...
-(sighs)

291
00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.055
And you're certain he's related by blood?

292
00:17:04.191 --> 00:17:06.026
(bell tolls)

293
00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.946
(birds fluttering, twittering)

294
00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:20.207
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men
and secure the place.

295
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:22.376
We'll head on.

296
00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.587
If we don't come back by dawn,
send a party.

297
00:17:25.671 --> 00:17:27.297
Yes, Your Majesty.

298
00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:44.731
Yeah, looks like nobody's in,
so do you think we should head back?

299
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.405
Do you want to come here
and guard... something?

300
00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:52.698
Ah, yes.

301
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:57.870
Good idea, cousin.
Very, um... logical.

302
00:18:08.297 --> 00:18:10.007
I've got it. I've got it.
Don't worry.

303
00:18:15.554 --> 00:18:17.598
(door rumbles, creaks)

304
00:18:30.235 --> 00:18:31.862
Uh, I'm ready to go when you are.

305
00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:44.208
LUCY: Who are all these people?

306
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:46.001
Why have they been crossed out?

307
00:18:47.794 --> 00:18:50.881
LUCY: It looks like some kind of fee.

308
00:18:50.964 --> 00:18:52.508
Slave traders.

309
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:54.259
(bell ringing, man yelling)

310
00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.138
Look out!

311
00:18:58.764 --> 00:18:59.681
(groans)

312
00:18:59.765 --> 00:19:01.725
(swords clanging)

313
00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:11.026
(Eustace screams)

314
00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:18.784
Unless you want to hear this
one squeal like a girl again,

315
00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:22.120
I'd say you should drop
your weapons.

316
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:23.747
-Like a girl?!
-Now!

317
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.332
(sword clatters onto ground)

318
00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:26.708
MAN: Put it down.

319
00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:28.752
Eustace.

320
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.754
Put them in irons.

321
00:19:30.838 --> 00:19:32.464
-Come on.
-Come here, you.

322
00:19:32.548 --> 00:19:34.716
(groans) Get your hands off me!

323
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.552
Let's take these two to market.

324
00:19:36.635 --> 00:19:37.636
LUCY: Let go!

325
00:19:37.719 --> 00:19:39.137
Send those two to the dungeons.

326
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:41.056
Listen to me, you insolent fool!

327
00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:42.474
I am your king!

328
00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:46.061
You're gonna pay for that.

329
00:19:46.144 --> 00:19:47.396
Actually...

330
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.274
...someone else is going to pay.

331
00:19:52.109 --> 00:19:53.610
For all of you.

332
00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:56.822
-LUCY: No! Edmund! Edmund!
-Lucy!

333
00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.324
LUCY (in distance): No! Edmund!

334
00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:06.957
(grunts)

335
00:20:08.584 --> 00:20:09.793
You all right?

336
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:12.254
Y-Yeah.

337
00:20:13.964 --> 00:20:15.382
(grunting)

338
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.177
MAN: It's hopeless.

339
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:21.138
You'll never get out.

340
00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:24.266
CASPIAN: Who's there?

341
00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:25.642
Nobody.

342
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.353
Just a voice in my head.

343
00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:40.657
Lord Bern?

344
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.370
Perhaps once.

345
00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:48.665
But I'm no longer
deserving of that title.

346
00:20:50.501 --> 00:20:51.710
Is he one of the seven?

347
00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:00.636
Your face.

348
00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:04.306
You remind me of a king
I once loved well.

349
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:06.308
That man was my father.

350
00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.603
(voice trembling) Oh, my Lord.

351
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.188
Please forgive me.

352
00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:13.690
No, please. Please.

353
00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:16.151
(horse neighs in distance)

354
00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:18.529
WOMAN: No!

355
00:21:18.612 --> 00:21:20.447
(people shouting)

356
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:22.449
(screaming, shouting)

357
00:21:24.535 --> 00:21:25.827
GIRL: Mummy!

358
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:27.412
Please!

359
00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:30.082
Mummy!

360
00:21:30.165 --> 00:21:31.875
Get back!

361
00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:34.002
-No!
-Mummy!

362
00:21:34.086 --> 00:21:35.254
Stay with Daddy!

363
00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:37.631
Don't worry! I'll find you!

364
00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:39.216
Mummy!

365
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:44.137
(screaming, shouting in distance)

366
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:51.728
WOMAN: No!

367
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.272
Where are they taking them?

368
00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:55.399
Keep watching.

369
00:21:58.277 --> 00:22:00.612
(thunder rumbling)

370
00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:11.665
(eerie voices moaning, whispering)

371
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.674
(people screaming)

372
00:22:24.803 --> 00:22:26.555
CASPIAN: What happened?

373
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:28.640
BERN: It's a sacrifice.

374
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:32.060
-Where did they go?
-No one knows.

375
00:22:32.936 --> 00:22:36.356
The mist was first seen in the East.

376
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.152
Reports of fishermen and sailors
disappearing out at sea.

377
00:22:40.611 --> 00:22:42.738
We lords made a pact

378
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:45.574
to find the source
of the mist to destroy it.

379
00:22:46.366 --> 00:22:47.534
They each set sail...

380
00:22:48.827 --> 00:22:50.245
...but none came back.

381
00:22:55.292 --> 00:22:58.837
You see, if they don't sell
you to the slave traders,

382
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:01.215
you're likely to be fed to the mist.

383
00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:02.883
EDMUND: We have to find Lucy.

384
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.010
Before it's too late.

385
00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:07.137
-MAN: I bid 60!
-MAN 2: I bid 80!

386
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:08.847
One hundred for the little lady!

387
00:23:08.931 --> 00:23:10.390
One hundred and twenty!

388
00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:12.142
On hundred fifty!

389
00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:14.061
MAN: Any more bids?

390
00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:15.771
(men murmuring)

391
00:23:17.523 --> 00:23:18.607
Sold!

392
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.067
(screams)

393
00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.237
Come on, move! Move!

394
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.115
MAN: And now, for this fine specimen,

395
00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:29.159
who'll kick off the bidding?

396
00:23:29.868 --> 00:23:31.954
Come on, now.

397
00:23:32.037 --> 00:23:35.541
He may not look like much,
but, uh, he's strong.

398
00:23:35.624 --> 00:23:38.252
RYNELF: Yeah, he's strong all right.
Smells like the rear end of a Minotaur.

399
00:23:38.335 --> 00:23:40.045
(laughter)

400
00:23:40.128 --> 00:23:42.005
That is an outrageous lie!

401
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:45.509
I won the school hygiene award
two years running.

402
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:46.802
-(laughter)
-Mm!

403
00:23:46.885 --> 00:23:49.179
Come on, someone make a bid!

404
00:23:49.263 --> 00:23:51.265
REEPICHEEP:
I'll take them off your hands.

405
00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:53.183
I'll take them all off your hands!

406
00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:54.518
For Narnia!

407
00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:55.727
-Narnia!
-Narnia!

408
00:23:55.811 --> 00:23:57.229
(men yelling, shouting)

409
00:23:59.064 --> 00:24:00.774
Guards! Guards!

410
00:24:00.858 --> 00:24:02.109
(swords clanging)

411
00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:06.071
(groaning, yelling)

412
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.283
(screams)

413
00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:13.453
(grunting, yelling)

414
00:24:17.416 --> 00:24:19.334
Thanks, Reep. I knew you'd come.

415
00:24:19.418 --> 00:24:20.711
Your Highness. Yah!

416
00:24:25.924 --> 00:24:26.925
(screams)

417
00:24:27.968 --> 00:24:29.428
Get the keys!

418
00:24:31.889 --> 00:24:33.098
(roars)

419
00:24:33.182 --> 00:24:34.308
(screams)

420
00:24:37.186 --> 00:24:38.478
Keys!

421
00:24:38.562 --> 00:24:39.771
(screams)

422
00:24:46.111 --> 00:24:48.155
(yelling)

423
00:24:48.238 --> 00:24:49.364
(gasps)

424
00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:52.659
(grunting)

425
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.704
(screams)

426
00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:57.414
(clamoring)

427
00:25:14.598 --> 00:25:17.935
Oh, you're a boat in a magical land.
Can't you row yourself?

428
00:25:31.073 --> 00:25:32.658
Whoa...

429
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:35.327
(grunting)

430
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.120
(gasps)

431
00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.915
Oh, God.
I hope that wasn't the British Consul.

432
00:25:39.998 --> 00:25:41.792
(cheering, applause)

433
00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:44.586
-Your Majesty. Your Majesty!
-Hold it!

434
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.713
My wife was taken just this morning.

435
00:25:46.797 --> 00:25:48.006
-Daddy!
-It's all right, Drinian.

436
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.508
I beg you, take me with you.

437
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:50.968
WOMAN: Gael!

438
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:53.846
-I want to come.
-No, Gael, stay with your aunt.

439
00:25:53.929 --> 00:25:55.389
I'm a fine sailor.

440
00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.432
Been on the seas my whole life.

441
00:25:57.516 --> 00:25:59.059
Of course, you must.

442
00:25:59.142 --> 00:26:00.686
-Thank you.
-But Daddy...

443
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:02.312
Have I ever not come back?

444
00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:05.482
Now, be good.

445
00:26:06.608 --> 00:26:08.318
(cheering, applause continues)

446
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:14.449
My king! My king!

447
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:21.623
This was given to me by your father.

448
00:26:21.707 --> 00:26:23.959
I hid it safely in a cave all these years.

449
00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:25.836
That's an old Narnian sword.

450
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.588
It's from your Golden Age.

451
00:26:27.671 --> 00:26:32.676
There are seven such swords,
gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

452
00:26:33.927 --> 00:26:36.388
Your father entrusted them to us.

453
00:26:37.264 --> 00:26:38.974
Here, take it.

454
00:26:42.436 --> 00:26:44.062
And may it protect you.

455
00:26:51.069 --> 00:26:53.280
(crowd cheering)

456
00:26:53.947 --> 00:26:55.115
CASPIAN: Thank you, my lord.

457
00:26:56.325 --> 00:26:57.993
And we shall find your lost citizens.

458
00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:03.707
Edmund.

459
00:27:13.258 --> 00:27:15.260

460

<i>EUSTACE: Dear diary,</i>

461
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.644
<i>there has been</i>
<i>an extraordinary turn of events.</i>

462
00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:27.231
<i>I've been abducted by my cousins</i>
<i>and set adrift in uncharted waters</i>

463
00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:29.525
<i>in some ridiculous-looking boat.</i>

464
00:27:29.608 --> 00:27:33.779
<i>What is worse is I share quarters</i>
<i>with an obnoxious mouse thing.</i>

465
00:27:33.862 --> 00:27:36.907
<i>And I thought bunking</i>
<i>with my cousin was bad enough.</i>

466
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:40.285
<i>So far, every person I've met</i>
<i>in this strange place</i>

467
00:27:40.369 --> 00:27:42.621
<i>suffers from the most florid delusions.</i>

468
00:27:42.704 --> 00:27:47.417
<i>Chasing green mists</i>
<i>and looking for lost lords.</i>

469
00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:50.379
<i>I can only assume that</i>
<i>this is the result of poor diet.</i>

470
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.507
<i>Or they're all just barking mad.</i>

471
00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.970
<i>Cousin Edmund is no exception.</i>

472
00:27:58.053 --> 00:28:01.265
<i>He spends every spare second</i>
<i>rubbing that tin sword of his</i>

473
00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:03.267
<i>like it's some magic lantern.</i>

474
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.810
<i>Poor fool</i>
<i>clearly needs a hobby.</i>

475
00:28:04.893 --> 00:28:06.478
It's going to be magnificent.

476
00:28:06.562 --> 00:28:07.980
Do they come in a smaller size?

477
00:28:08.063 --> 00:28:09.189
(chuckles)

478
00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:10.941

480
00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:15.821
(squawks)

481
00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:19.491
In England, we have mouse
traps for that sort of thing.

482
00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:24.746
Speaking of food, you don't know
where I could get any, do you?

483
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.206
(cheeps)

484
00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:28.876
TAVROS: Uh, why are you
talking to that bird?

485
00:28:30.002 --> 00:28:31.712
I just naturally
assumed he can...

486
00:28:31.795 --> 00:28:35.632
(guffawing) He's talking to birds!

487
00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:37.342
He's mad as a loon, that one.

488
00:28:37.426 --> 00:28:40.053
-Yeah! (laughing)
-(grunts)

489
00:28:40.137 --> 00:28:41.305
Shoo! Go on, get off!

490
00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:42.514
(squawks)

491
00:28:46.518 --> 00:28:48.478
(crewmen chatting in distance)

492
00:28:55.444 --> 00:28:57.446
CREWMAN: ...found a maggot
in one last week.

493
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.207
REEPICHEEP: Are you aware...

494
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.084
stealing rations
is a capital offense at sea?

495
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:13.962
Up here.

496
00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:16.548
Oh, you.

497
00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:19.676
Men have been keelhauled for less.

498
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.428
-For what?
-For treason and...

499
00:29:21.512 --> 00:29:23.805
and sneakiness
and general nuisancery.

500
00:29:23.889 --> 00:29:26.433
Look, just hand over the orange,
and we'll let the matter pass.

501
00:29:26.517 --> 00:29:28.310
I don't know what
you're talking about.

502
00:29:28.393 --> 00:29:30.145
Allow me to clar... (gasps)

503
00:29:30.229 --> 00:29:31.813
Look, I've had quite enough of you.

504
00:29:31.897 --> 00:29:33.899
Unhand the tail.

505
00:29:33.982 --> 00:29:37.110
The great Aslan himself gave me this tail.

506
00:29:37.194 --> 00:29:40.405
No one-- repeat, no one--
touches the tail.

507
00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:42.699
Period, exclamation mark.

508
00:29:42.783 --> 00:29:44.284
Sorry.

509
00:29:44.368 --> 00:29:47.996
Now, I will have the orange.
Then I will have satisfaction.

510
00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.123
(stammering):
Please. I'm a pacifist.

511
00:29:50.207 --> 00:29:51.208
En garde!

512
00:29:56.755 --> 00:29:58.465
-Oh! Sorry.
-Watch it.

513
00:30:00.175 --> 00:30:01.468
(clattering)

514
00:30:02.594 --> 00:30:03.804
Trying to run away?

515
00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:05.806
We're on a boat, you know.

516
00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:07.516
Look, can't we just discuss this?

517
00:30:08.225 --> 00:30:09.560
That was for stealing,

518
00:30:09.643 --> 00:30:11.186
that was for lying,

519
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.438
and that was for good measure.

520
00:30:14.231 --> 00:30:15.899
(hearty laughter)

521
00:30:15.983 --> 00:30:17.568
That's the spirit!

522
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:20.529
We have ourselves a duel.
Catch!

523
00:30:20.612 --> 00:30:23.782
Now, come on.
Take your best shot.

524
00:30:24.533 --> 00:30:26.368
Is that it? Come on, boy.

525
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:29.621
Focus. Focus. Yes!

526
00:30:29.705 --> 00:30:33.041
Now, stop flapping your wings
like a drunken pelican.

527
00:30:33.125 --> 00:30:34.501
Poise!

528
00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:37.212
Keep your blade up.
Up, up! That's it.

529
00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:39.506
-Now...
-(grunting)

530
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.969
(Reepicheep grunting and laughing)

531
00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:46.889
Yoo-hoo! Over here!

532
00:30:46.972 --> 00:30:48.640
Now, lunge with your foot.

533
00:30:48.724 --> 00:30:50.767
Not your left; your right.

534
00:30:50.851 --> 00:30:52.144
Got it? Come on.

535
00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:53.645
Be nimble. Be nimble.

536
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:55.689
It's a dance, boy-- a dance.
Come on.

537
00:30:55.772 --> 00:30:57.649
Now, again and again.

538
00:30:57.733 --> 00:30:59.067
That's right. That's right.

539
00:30:59.151 --> 00:31:00.611
That's... (whimpers)

540
00:31:00.694 --> 00:31:02.070
Oh, no!

541
00:31:08.535 --> 00:31:12.039
And that... is that.

542
00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:13.832
-(girl screams)
-(laughter and applause)

543
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.129
Look.

544
00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:22.508
Gael?

545
00:31:23.425 --> 00:31:24.635
What are you doing here?

546
00:31:31.767 --> 00:31:33.060
Here.

547
00:31:43.612 --> 00:31:45.822
Looks like we have an extra crew member.

548
00:31:54.331 --> 00:31:56.750
-Welcome aboard.
-Your Majesty.

549
00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:59.336
Call me Lucy. Come on.

550
00:32:00.128 --> 00:32:02.840
DRINIAN: Come on, look lively.
Back to work.

551
00:32:04.007 --> 00:32:05.300
(men shouting commands)

552
00:32:05.384 --> 00:32:06.802
REEPICHEEP: Good match.

553
00:32:06.885 --> 00:32:08.929
I'll make a swordsman of you yet.

554
00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:15.018
Yes, well, if the playing field
were a little more even,

555
00:32:15.102 --> 00:32:16.812
would have been
an entirely different result.

556
00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:19.439
(laughs) Indeed.

557
00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:23.694
(crewmen shouting commands)

558
00:32:31.743 --> 00:32:33.287
CASPIAN: It looks uninhabited.

559
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.332
But if the lords followed the mist East,
they would have stopped here.

560
00:32:37.958 --> 00:32:39.668
Could be a trap.

561
00:32:40.586 --> 00:32:42.713
EDMUND: Or it could hold some answers.

562
00:32:42.796 --> 00:32:44.006
Caspian?

563
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:49.678
We'll spend the night on shore,
scour the island in the morning.

564
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:51.305
Aye, Your Majesty.

565
00:33:01.565 --> 00:33:04.067
(snoring)

566
00:33:05.485 --> 00:33:07.196
(heavy footsteps thudding)

567
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.368
VOICE (whispering):
Seems they've brought a pig.

568
00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:15.495
(snoring)

569
00:33:17.581 --> 00:33:20.209
VOICE 2: This one-- it's female.

570
00:33:22.127 --> 00:33:23.712
VOICE 3: So's this one.

571
00:33:25.506 --> 00:33:28.675
VOICE 1: This one reads.

572
00:33:28.759 --> 00:33:30.302
VOICE 4: Let's take her.

573
00:33:30.385 --> 00:33:32.304
(gasps)

574
00:33:37.142 --> 00:33:39.394
(muffled shouting)

575
00:33:43.565 --> 00:33:45.984
(muffled grunting)

576
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.873
(panting)

577
00:33:59.957 --> 00:34:02.376
(voice grunts)

578
00:34:02.459 --> 00:34:03.710
(thump)

579
00:34:03.794 --> 00:34:05.754
(voices laughing)

580
00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:07.881
VOICE 4: There is no escape.

581
00:34:07.965 --> 00:34:09.758
-VOICE 1: Well put.
-VOICE 2: Scary.

582
00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:11.385
-VOICE 3: Yeah.
-What are you?

583
00:34:11.468 --> 00:34:13.887
VOICE 1: We are terrifying
invisible beasts.

584
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.640
VOICE 4: If you could see us,
you would be really intimidated.

585
00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:18.100
-VOICE 2: Yeah.
-VOICE 3: Yeah.

586
00:34:18.183 --> 00:34:20.978
VOICE 1: Uh, you forgot to
mention that we are very large!

587
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:23.063
-Well, what do you want?
-VOICE 4: You.

588
00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:24.356
You'll do what we ask.

589
00:34:24.439 --> 00:34:26.149
-VOICE 1: She will.
-VOICE 3: Very clear.

590
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:27.734
-VOICE 2: Well put.
-VOICE 3: Yeah.

591
00:34:29.027 --> 00:34:31.446
-Or what?
-VOICE 4: Or death.

592
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.115
ALL: Death? Death?! Death?

593
00:34:33.198 --> 00:34:35.701
(chanting) Death! Death! Death! Death!

594
00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.661
Death! Death! Death!

595
00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:41.039
Well, I wouldn't be much use
to you dead, now, would I?

596
00:34:41.123 --> 00:34:42.916
VOICE 4: I hadn't thought of that.

597
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.252
-VOICE 2: No, you hadn't.
-VOICE 3: Fair point.

598
00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:48.547
VOICE 1: All right.
Then we'll just kill your friends.

599
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.008
(voices oohing)

600
00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:52.593
-VOICE 2: Good idea.
-VOICE 3: Yeah.

601
00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:54.344
What do you want with me?

602
00:34:54.428 --> 00:34:58.515
VOICE 4: You will enter
the house of the Oppressor.

603
00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:00.309
What house?

604
00:35:00.392 --> 00:35:01.602
VOICE 4: This one.

605
00:35:01.685 --> 00:35:03.729
(latch rattles, door thuds)

606
00:35:08.901 --> 00:35:12.988
VOICE 4: Upstairs, you'll find
the Book of Incantations.

607
00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:16.158
Recite the spell
that makes the unseen seen.

608
00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:18.076
VOICE 3: Well put, Chief. Well put.

609
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.412

00:35:20.495 --> 00:35:22.080
(birds chirping)

611
00:35:22.164 --> 00:35:24.249

We haven't got all day.

612
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.126

will happen to your friends.

613
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.961
VOICE 1: You've been warned.

614
00:35:28.045 --> 00:35:29.254
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

615
00:35:29.338 --> 00:35:32.174
-Right.
-Right.

616
00:35:32.257 --> 00:35:33.425
Yeah.

617
00:35:33.509 --> 00:35:34.927
Why don't you do it yourselves?

618
00:35:35.886 --> 00:35:37.429
VOICE 4: We can't read.

619
00:35:37.513 --> 00:35:39.556
VOICE 1: Can't write, either,
as a matter of fact.

620
00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:42.351
-VOICE 2: Or add.
-VOICE 3: Yeah.

621
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:46.104
Why didn't you just say so?

622
00:35:46.772 --> 00:35:48.565
VOICE 4: Beware the Oppressor.

623
00:35:48.649 --> 00:35:50.442
VOICE 1: He's very oppressive.

624
00:35:50.526 --> 00:35:54.238
VOICE 4: What makes
the unseen seen-- got it?

625
00:35:54.321 --> 00:35:55.989

-VOICE 2: Don't forget that.

626

628
00:36:09.044 --> 00:36:10.170
Ed.

629
00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.131
-Ed, wake up.
-Huh?

630
00:36:13.215 --> 00:36:14.758
Wake up. Look.

631
00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:25.227
Where's Lucy?

632
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.854
Lucy?

633
00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:29.314
-Lucy!
-CASPIAN: Everybody up!

634
00:36:29.982 --> 00:36:31.900
Get up. Get up, I said!

635
00:36:33.944 --> 00:36:35.529
-This way.
-DRINIAN: Look lively.

636
00:36:35.612 --> 00:36:36.947
Move, you blaggards!

637
00:36:40.576 --> 00:36:42.494

"With these words your tongue must sew

643
00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:46.808

(eerie, overlapping voices
whispering indistinctly)

647
00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:40.404
"An infallible spell to make you she,

648
00:38:40.487 --> 00:38:42.656
the beauty you've always wanted to be."

649
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.043
Susan, what's going...

650
00:38:56.795 --> 00:38:57.963
...on?

651
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.636
I'm beautiful.

652
00:39:16.899 --> 00:39:18.275
No! Wait.

653
00:39:20.485 --> 00:39:22.154
"Make me she, whom I'd agree..."

654
00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:28.952
(roaring)

-Lucy.
-Aslan?

657
00:39:37.794 --> 00:39:38.962
Aslan.

658
00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:49.389
(eerie voices whispering)

659
00:39:53.977 --> 00:39:56.855
"A spell to make the unseen seen.

660
00:39:58.565 --> 00:40:01.318
Like the 'P' in psychology,

661
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:03.570
the 'H' in psychiatry,

662
00:40:03.654 --> 00:40:06.406
invisible ink and the truth
in theology..."

-What sort of creatures are you?
-VOICE 4: Big ones,

00:40:52.327 --> 00:40:54.621
with the head
of a tiger and a body of a...

674
00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:56.707
-VOICE 2: Different tiger.
-Yeah.

675

VOICE 4: You don't want
to mess with us.

676

Or what?

677
00:41:00.377 --> 00:41:02.629
Or I'll claw you to death!

678
00:41:02.713 --> 00:41:04.089
(others murmuring in agreement)

679
00:41:04.173 --> 00:41:07.509
And I'll ram my tusks
right through you.

680
00:41:07.593 --> 00:41:10.053
And I'll gnash you with my teeth.

681
00:41:10.137 --> 00:41:12.472
And I'll bite you
with my fangs. (growls)

682
00:41:12.556 --> 00:41:15.267
EDMUND: You mean squash us
with your fat bellies?

683
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.477
-Yes!
-Fat bellies? Huh?

684
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:18.604
CASPIAN: Tickle us with your toes?

-Whoa! (grunts)
-(laughs)

686
00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:24.067
What have you done with my sister,
you little pipsqueak?

687
00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:27.738
-Now, calm down.
-Where is she?

688
00:41:27.821 --> 00:41:29.573
-You better tell him.
-Tell him, Chief.

689
00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:31.366
-Tell him.
-In the mansion.

690
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.618
What mansion?

691
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.080
(rumbling, liquid rippling)

692
00:41:41.877 --> 00:41:44.463
Oh. That mansion.

693
00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:47.424
You know, I'm really getting tired of you
all leaving me behi--

694
00:41:47.508 --> 00:41:50.594
-It's the pig.
-The pig's come back.

695
00:41:50.677 --> 00:41:53.055
This place just gets weirder
and weirder.

696
00:41:53.138 --> 00:41:55.140
Weird?
Him calling us weird?

697
00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.643
The Oppressor!
The Oppressor!

698
00:41:57.726 --> 00:41:59.686
-(clamoring, gasping)
-The Oppressor! Oppressor!

699
00:42:00.854 --> 00:42:02.022
Lucy.

700
00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:04.566
Your Majesty.

701
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.443
Caspian and Edmund.

702
00:42:07.236 --> 00:42:09.947
This is Coriakin. It's his island.

703
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:13.534
That's what he thinks.
You have wronged us, magician.

704
00:42:13.617 --> 00:42:15.953
I have not wronged you.

705
00:42:16.036 --> 00:42:18.830
I made you invisible
for your own protection.

706
00:42:18.914 --> 00:42:20.707
-Protection?
-That's oppressive!

707
00:42:20.791 --> 00:42:23.752
-Oppressor!
-I have not oppressed you.

708
00:42:23.836 --> 00:42:26.129
But you could've... if you'd wanted to.

709
00:42:26.213 --> 00:42:27.422
Begone.

710
00:42:27.506 --> 00:42:29.967
-It's a spell!
-(anxious shouting)

711
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.261
What was that?

712
00:42:32.344 --> 00:42:34.847
Lint. But don't tell them.

713
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.598
(frantic chattering)

714
00:42:38.016 --> 00:42:40.561
-What were those things?
-Dufflepuds.

715
00:42:41.687 --> 00:42:43.063
Right. Of course. Silly me.

716
00:42:43.146 --> 00:42:44.690
DUFFLEPUD: Get out of here!

717
00:42:46.233 --> 00:42:47.734
What did you mean when you said

718
00:42:47.818 --> 00:42:50.070
you made them invisible
for their own good?

719
00:42:50.153 --> 00:42:54.116
It seemed the easiest way
to protect them from the evil.

720
00:42:55.576 --> 00:42:56.869
You mean the mist?

721
00:42:58.495 --> 00:43:00.622
I mean what lies behind the mist.

722
00:43:19.808 --> 00:43:21.268
That's quite beautiful.

723
00:43:23.645 --> 00:43:25.355
(horses neighing)

724
00:43:26.064 --> 00:43:28.734
-(dogs barking)
-(lion roaring)

725
00:43:29.776 --> 00:43:32.321
I mean, for a make-believe
map of a make-believe world.

726
00:43:33.322 --> 00:43:34.907
There is the source of your troubles.

727
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:37.993
Dark Island.

728
00:43:39.328 --> 00:43:41.163
A place where evil lurks.

729
00:43:43.457 --> 00:43:46.084
It can take any form.

730
00:43:46.168 --> 00:43:48.712
It can make your
darkest dreams come true.

731
00:43:49.963 --> 00:43:52.633
It seeks to corrupt all goodness...

732
00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:56.428
...to steal the light from this world.

733
00:43:56.512 --> 00:43:57.888
How do we stop it?

734
00:43:58.639 --> 00:44:00.432
You must break its spell.

735
00:44:01.642 --> 00:44:03.727
That sword you carry--

736
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.521
there are six others.

737
00:44:05.604 --> 00:44:07.231
-Have you seen them?
-Yes.

738
00:44:07.314 --> 00:44:09.942
The six lords--
they passed through here?

739
00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:11.568
Indeed.

740
00:44:11.652 --> 00:44:12.736
Where were they headed?

741
00:44:12.819 --> 00:44:14.196
Where I sent them.

742
00:44:18.367 --> 00:44:19.826
To break the spell...

743
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:22.871
you must follow the Blue Star...

744
00:44:24.373 --> 00:44:25.958
...to Ramandu's Island.

745
00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:30.087
There the seven swords must be
laid at Aslan's table.

746
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.132
Only then can their true
magical power be released.

747
00:44:37.177 --> 00:44:38.554
But beware.

748
00:44:38.637 --> 00:44:41.682
You are all about to be tested.

749
00:44:41.765 --> 00:44:42.933
Tested?

750
00:44:45.644 --> 00:44:50.148
Until you lay down the seventh sword,
evil has the upper hand.

751
00:44:51.358 --> 00:44:55.696
It will do everything
in its power to tempt you.

752
00:45:02.327 --> 00:45:03.620
Be strong.

753
00:45:05.247 --> 00:45:07.833
Don't fall to temptation.

754
00:45:09.084 --> 00:45:11.211
To defeat the darkness out there...

755
00:45:12.629 --> 00:45:14.798
...you must defeat the darkness
inside yourself.

756
00:45:24.099 --> 00:45:26.059
(whooshing)

757
00:45:26.143 --> 00:45:27.853
(thunder rumbling)

758
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:36.570
-(crewmen shouting)
-(thunder crashing)

759
00:45:44.912 --> 00:45:47.039
<i>EUSTACE: For reasons</i>
<i>beyond my comprehension,</i>

760
00:45:47.122 --> 00:45:49.708
<i>we've taken the advice</i>
<i>of a senile, old coot</i>

761
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.710
<i>who doesn't possess a razor</i>

762
00:45:51.793 --> 00:45:54.046
<i>and dawdles around</i>
<i>in a dressing gown.</i>

763
00:45:54.129 --> 00:45:57.883
<i>So we're back in this tub</i>
<i>and lost in a tempest.</i>

764
00:45:57.966 --> 00:45:59.218
<i>Brilliant.</i>

765
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:00.594
-Hold!
-(crewman shouting)

766
00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:02.513
(ship creaking)

767
00:46:02.596 --> 00:46:05.641
-Three spokes to starboard!
-Aye, aye, sir!

768
00:46:05.724 --> 00:46:07.935
-More pails here!
-Pass it down!

769
00:46:08.018 --> 00:46:11.313
-(crewmen shouting)
-Heave!

770
00:46:11.396 --> 00:46:13.899
<i>EUSTACE: Fourteen days</i>
<i>of being tossed like a pancake</i>

771
00:46:13.982 --> 00:46:16.318
<i>and not the slightest sign of land.</i>

772

(crewmen shouting)

773
00:46:20.572 --> 00:46:24.618
<i>The only consolation is everyone</i>
<i>is finally as miserable as I am.</i>

774
00:46:27.329 --> 00:46:30.082
<i>Except for that show-off talking rat.</i>

775
00:46:30.624 --> 00:46:34.169
<i>He's one of those annoying</i>
<i>glass-is-always-half-full types.</i>

776
00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.759
So, we're stuck here.

777
00:46:42.386 --> 00:46:46.306
At half rations, with food and water
for two more weeks, maximum.

778
00:46:48.267 --> 00:46:50.853
This is your last chance
to turn back, Your Majesties.

779
00:46:51.895 --> 00:46:54.857
There's no guarantee we'll spot
the Blue Star anytime soon.

780
00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.316
Not in this storm.

781
00:46:57.109 --> 00:47:00.362
Needle in a haystack,
trying to find this Ramandu place.

782
00:47:00.445 --> 00:47:03.031
We could sail right past it
and off the edge of the world.

783
00:47:03.115 --> 00:47:04.992
Or get eaten by a sea serpent.

784
00:47:05.075 --> 00:47:06.952
(thunder rumbling)

785
00:47:07.786 --> 00:47:09.955
I'm just saying,
the men are getting nervous.

786
00:47:10.998 --> 00:47:15.669
These are strange seas we're sailing,
the likes of which I've never seen before.

787
00:47:16.503 --> 00:47:19.965
Then perhaps, Captain, you would like
to be the one to explain to Mr. Rhince

788
00:47:20.048 --> 00:47:21.842
that we're abandoning the search
for his family.

789
00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:26.138
I'll get back to it.

790
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.185
Just a word of warning.

791
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.064
The sea can play nasty tricks
on a crew's mind.

792
00:47:37.482 --> 00:47:39.026
Very nasty.

793
00:47:43.071 --> 00:47:45.199
(crewmen shouting commands)

794
00:47:50.913 --> 00:47:52.289
(lamp squeaking)

795
00:48:11.517 --> 00:48:13.268
"Transform my reflection,

796
00:48:13.352 --> 00:48:17.356
cast into perfection,
lashes, lips and complexion.

797
00:48:17.439 --> 00:48:20.776
Make me she whom I'd agree

798
00:48:20.859 --> 00:48:22.819
holds more beauty over me."

799
00:48:35.582 --> 00:48:37.501
(thunder stops)

800
00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:21.211
(jazz band playing "In the Mood")

801
00:49:24.506 --> 00:49:26.216
(people conversing, laughing)

802
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.639
Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Pevensie.

803
00:49:33.307 --> 00:49:35.684
(applause)

804
00:49:35.767 --> 00:49:37.102
She's quite a looker.

805
00:49:37.186 --> 00:49:38.770
Swell.

806
00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:40.105
Edmund!

807
00:49:40.189 --> 00:49:41.732
You look beautiful, sister.

808
00:49:41.815 --> 00:49:43.066
As always.

809
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:44.276
Peter!

810
00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:47.112
Excuse me, miss,
can I get a photo?

811
00:49:47.196 --> 00:49:49.198
Mother is going to love this.

812
00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:51.200
All her children in one picture.

813
00:49:51.283 --> 00:49:52.534
Smile.

814
00:49:52.618 --> 00:49:54.328
Hang on, where am I?

815
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:56.413
I mean, where's Lucy?

816
00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:58.999
Lucy? Who's Lucy?

817
00:49:59.625 --> 00:50:01.502
Susan, what's wrong?

818
00:50:01.585 --> 00:50:04.296
Come on now, miss.
Nice, big smile.

819
00:50:04.379 --> 00:50:07.090
Edmund, I'm not sure about all this.
I think I want to go back.

820
00:50:07.174 --> 00:50:10.093
-Go back where?
-To Narnia.

821
00:50:10.177 --> 00:50:11.595
What on earth is Narnia?

822
00:50:12.179 --> 00:50:14.681
What's going on? Stop this!

823
00:50:18.143 --> 00:50:19.478
(gasps)

824
00:50:22.147 --> 00:50:23.315
Lucy.

825
00:50:24.608 --> 00:50:25.776
Aslan?

826
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.657
What have you
done, child?

827
00:50:33.367 --> 00:50:34.576
I don't know.

828
00:50:35.619 --> 00:50:36.870
That was awful.

829
00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.665
But you chose it, Lucy.

830
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.126
I didn't mean to choose all of that.

831
00:50:44.419 --> 00:50:46.755
I just wanted to be beautiful like Susan.

832
00:50:48.131 --> 00:50:49.174
That's all.

833
00:50:50.259 --> 00:50:54.388
You wished yourself away
and with it, much more.

834
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:58.559
Your brothers and sister
wouldn't know Narnia without you, Lucy.

835
00:50:59.142 --> 00:51:01.353
You discovered it first, remember?

836
00:51:04.356 --> 00:51:05.774
I'm so sorry.

837
00:51:06.984 --> 00:51:08.569
You doubt your value.

838
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.822
Don't run from who you are.

839
00:51:13.657 --> 00:51:15.784
-(thunder cracks)
-Aslan!

840
00:51:15.868 --> 00:51:17.786
(ship creaking)

841
00:51:27.713 --> 00:51:29.423
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

842
00:51:39.391 --> 00:51:41.101
(roaring)

843
00:51:43.478 --> 00:51:46.857
(eerie voices whispering)

844
00:52:06.752 --> 00:52:07.878
Father...

845
00:52:09.505 --> 00:52:11.256
Father... (groans)

846
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.635
FEMALE VOICE:
Edmund... Edmund...

847
00:52:16.553 --> 00:52:18.722
Come with me.

848
00:52:18.805 --> 00:52:19.932
Join me.

849
00:52:23.644 --> 00:52:24.895
-LUCY: Edmund.
-(gasps)

850
00:52:29.358 --> 00:52:30.609
Oh, Lucy.

851
00:52:32.027 --> 00:52:33.362
(gasps)

852
00:52:33.445 --> 00:52:34.947
I can't sleep.

853
00:52:35.989 --> 00:52:38.534
Let me guess. Bad dreams.

854
00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:42.204
So either we're all going mad...

855
00:52:44.373 --> 00:52:46.083
...or something's playing
with our minds.

856
00:53:08.564 --> 00:53:10.482
I doubt the lords
stopped here, my liege.

857
00:53:10.566 --> 00:53:12.234
There's no sign of anything living.

858
00:53:12.317 --> 00:53:14.444
Right.
Well, once we get ashore,

859
00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:16.697
take your men and search
for food and water.

860
00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.824
The three of us will look for clues.

861
00:53:18.907 --> 00:53:20.534
Hang on, you mean the four of us.

862
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:25.455
Come on, please don't
send me back to the rat.

863
00:53:25.539 --> 00:53:27.374
I heard that.

864
00:53:28.709 --> 00:53:29.960
(quietly) Big ears.

865
00:53:30.043 --> 00:53:31.962
I heard that, too.

866
00:53:32.045 --> 00:53:33.964
(chuckling)

867
00:53:37.426 --> 00:53:39.428
Go on, unload it all.

868
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:41.430
(distant rumbling)

869
00:53:43.599 --> 00:53:45.642
(rumbling continues)

870
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.316
CASPIAN: Look, we're not
the first ones on this island.

871
00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:53.859
The lords?

872
00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:55.402
Could be.

873
00:53:59.823 --> 00:54:01.825
What do you think could be down there?

874
00:54:03.452 --> 00:54:04.536
EDMUND: Let's find out.

875
00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:14.546
(rumbling continues)

876
00:54:41.698 --> 00:54:43.325
CASPIAN: What's that?

877
00:54:43.408 --> 00:54:44.743
I don't know.

878
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:46.578
Looks like some sort of gold statue.

879
00:54:48.997 --> 00:54:50.374
(cracks, snaps)

880
00:55:01.343 --> 00:55:03.053
(wood crackling)

881
00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:07.558
(yells)

882
00:55:18.026 --> 00:55:19.862
He must have fallen in.

883
00:55:21.572 --> 00:55:22.739
Poor man.

884
00:55:22.823 --> 00:55:24.449
EDMUND: You mean, "poor lord."

885
00:55:24.533 --> 00:55:27.119
-The crest of Lord Restimar.
-And his sword.

886
00:55:27.202 --> 00:55:28.579
CASPIAN: We need it.

887
00:55:28.662 --> 00:55:31.582
(eerie voices murmuring)

888
00:55:31.665 --> 00:55:33.000
Be careful.

889
00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:39.756
LUCY: Your sword hasn't turned to gold.

890
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.258
CASPIAN: Both the swords
are magical.

891
00:55:42.843 --> 00:55:43.886
Here.

892
00:55:47.264 --> 00:55:48.724
He mustn't have known what hit him.

893
00:55:49.766 --> 00:55:50.809
EDMUND: Maybe.

894
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:53.604
Or maybe he was onto something.

895
00:55:55.731 --> 00:55:56.982
What are you talking about?

896
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.295
What are you staring at?

897
00:56:20.339 --> 00:56:22.466
Whoever has access
to this pool...

898
00:56:24.259 --> 00:56:26.595
...could be the most powerful
person in the world.

899
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:33.435
Lucy... we'd be so rich.

900
00:56:34.144 --> 00:56:36.063
No one could tell us what to do.

901
00:56:36.146 --> 00:56:37.814
Or who to live with.

902
00:56:37.898 --> 00:56:40.234
You can't take anything
out of Narnia, Edmund.

903
00:56:40.317 --> 00:56:42.236
Says who?

904
00:56:43.195 --> 00:56:44.279
I do.

905
00:56:51.995 --> 00:56:53.413
I'm not your subject.

906
00:56:54.122 --> 00:56:56.124
You've been waiting for this, haven't you?

907
00:56:56.208 --> 00:56:58.252
To challenge me.
You doubt my leadership.

908
00:56:58.335 --> 00:56:59.670
You doubt yourself.

909
00:56:59.753 --> 00:57:02.005
-You're a child!
-And you're a spineless sap!

910
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:04.925
-Edmund.
-I'm tired of playing second fiddle.

911
00:57:05.008 --> 00:57:07.427
First it was Peter, and now it's you.

912
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:10.013
You know I'm braver
than both of you.

913
00:57:10.097 --> 00:57:12.140
Why do you get Peter's sword?

914
00:57:12.224 --> 00:57:14.476
I deserve a kingdom of my own.

915
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.978
I deserve to rule!

916
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:18.397
If you think you're so brave, prove it!

917
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.232
(yells)

918
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.902
No! Stop it!

919
00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.363
Both of you!

920
00:57:27.322 --> 00:57:28.740
Look at yourselves.

921
00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:31.326
Can't you see what's happening?

922
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.996
This place has tempted you.

923
00:57:35.038 --> 00:57:36.373
It's bewitching you.

924
00:57:37.165 --> 00:57:39.418
This is exactly what Coriakin
was talking about.

925
00:57:40.836 --> 00:57:42.212
Let's just get out of here.

926
00:57:59.563 --> 00:58:01.315
(eerie voices murmuring)

927
00:58:06.153 --> 00:58:09.406
Oh, yes, follow the imaginary Blue Star

928
00:58:09.489 --> 00:58:11.450
to the island of Ramandoodoo.

929
00:58:11.533 --> 00:58:13.118
(steam whooshing)

930
00:58:13.202 --> 00:58:15.454
Lay the seven steak knives
at the table of the talking lion.

931
00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:18.290
(snorts) Ninnies.

932
00:58:20.501 --> 00:58:22.211
(steam whooshes, hisses)

933
00:58:29.468 --> 00:58:31.887
What is th-- (grunting)

934
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:45.943
I must be dead.

935
00:59:09.842 --> 00:59:11.176
(startled shout)

936
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.055
You're definitely dead.

937
00:59:21.895 --> 00:59:23.397
Won't be needing that then, will you?

938
00:59:30.112 --> 00:59:32.906
(eerie growl echoes from distance )

939
00:59:39.788 --> 00:59:43.000
Finally, a favorable turn of events.

940
00:59:43.083 --> 00:59:45.169
(eerie voices murmuring)

941
00:59:52.885 --> 00:59:54.052
What food did you find?

942
00:59:56.555 --> 00:59:58.473
It's volcanic, Your Majesty.

943
00:59:58.557 --> 01:00:00.142
Not much grows.

944
01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:02.728
Where's Eustace?

945
01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:07.608
I believe he's out,
not helping us load the boats.

946
01:00:07.691 --> 01:00:08.901
LUCY: Eustace!

947
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:11.195
Eustace!

948
01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:12.988
(steam hisses)

949
01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:16.325
Edmund, I've got a bad feeling.

950
01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:18.243
I'll go find him.

951
01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:20.078
I'll come with you.

952
01:00:20.162 --> 01:00:23.040
(rumbling continues in distance)

953
01:00:30.631 --> 01:00:31.798
CASPIAN: Eustace!

954
01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:34.718
EDMUND: Eustace!

955
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:41.558
EDMUND: Treasure.

956
01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:45.395
Trouble.

957
01:00:54.655 --> 01:00:56.031
Eustace.

958
01:01:00.661 --> 01:01:01.828
No.

959
01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:08.627
Oh, cousin.

960
01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.631
I'm sorry.

961
01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.174
He was just a boy.

962
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.136
I never should have left him.

963
01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:24.560
What could have happened to him?

964
01:01:25.686 --> 01:01:28.272
In this place? Anything.

965
01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:31.066
And he wasn't the first.

966
01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:35.237
It's Lord Octesian.

967
01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:39.867
We should find his...

968
01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:43.579
...sword.

969
01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:52.504
(crewmen conversing)

970
01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:54.548
(screeching roar)

971
01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:03.640
What was that?

972
01:02:03.724 --> 01:02:06.476
(screeching roar)

973
01:02:08.187 --> 01:02:09.688
Is it the volcano?

974
01:02:11.565 --> 01:02:14.610
Oh, no... that's no volcano.

975
01:02:14.693 --> 01:02:16.445
All hands on deck there!

976
01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:21.074
(screeching roar)

977
01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.827
Archers, arm yourselves!

978
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:25.829
(wings flapping)

979
01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:30.167
CREWMAN: Here, here.

980
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:32.002
FIRST MATE: Take one and pass them on.

981
01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:33.587
(deep grunt)

982
01:02:36.089 --> 01:02:37.591
(screeches)

983
01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:42.638
(men shouting)

984
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:45.432
Take your positions
and wait for my command!

985
01:02:45.516 --> 01:02:46.850
(dragon roars)

986
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.644
(grunts)

987
01:02:52.606 --> 01:02:54.691
What's it doing?!

988
01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:56.318
Fire!

989
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:58.695
-Fire!
-Fire!

990
01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:00.781
(dragon roars)

991
01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.908
He'll break the mast.

992
01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:07.704
(all shouting)

993
01:03:07.788 --> 01:03:09.039
Right!

994
01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.751
DRINIAN: Hold your positions!

995
01:03:12.835 --> 01:03:13.877
(growls)

996
01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:17.172
-Fire!
-Fire!

997
01:03:17.256 --> 01:03:19.341
(roaring)

998
01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:24.888
Take... that!

999
01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:26.890
(roaring)

1000
01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.270
(crewmen cheering)

1001
01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:47.828
-Edmund! Ed!
-(grunts)

1002
01:03:52.374 --> 01:03:54.835
-Edmund!
-Lucy!

1003
01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:00.632
(Edmund grunts)

1004
01:04:05.596 --> 01:04:08.473
(grunting, gasping)

1005
01:04:12.394 --> 01:04:13.770
(gasping)

1006
01:04:22.196 --> 01:04:23.822
You have got to be joking.

1007
01:04:30.162 --> 01:04:31.955
(Eustace growls)

1008
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.835
He must have been tempted
by the treasure.

1009
01:04:38.128 --> 01:04:40.631
CASPIAN: Well, anyone knows
a dragon's treasure is enchanted.

1010
01:04:40.714 --> 01:04:41.715
(snarls)

1011
01:04:41.798 --> 01:04:43.425
Well, anyone from here.

1012
01:04:55.479 --> 01:04:56.939
(pained roar)

1013
01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:00.984
Is there any way to change him back?

1014
01:05:01.068 --> 01:05:02.069
Not that I know of.

1015
01:05:03.737 --> 01:05:05.864
(low growl)

1016
01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:08.992
-Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.
-(huffs)

1017
01:05:09.076 --> 01:05:11.286
REEPICHEEP: Sorry about the hand, old boy.

1018
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.038
I can be a little overzealous at times.

1019
01:05:13.121 --> 01:05:14.414
(low growl)

1020
01:05:14.498 --> 01:05:16.083
TAVROS: The boats are ready, sire.

1021
01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:17.543
We can't leave him alone.

1022
01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:20.254
Well, we can't bring him on board,
Your Majesty.

1023
01:05:20.337 --> 01:05:22.339
Drinian, you and the others
take one boat back.

1024
01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:24.216
The rest of us will stay
here till morning and...

1025
01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:25.884
work out what to do.

1026
01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.719
But you've no provisions

1027
01:05:27.803 --> 01:05:30.097
and no means of staying warm,
Your Majesty.

1028
01:05:34.226 --> 01:05:35.310
You were saying?

1029
01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:37.855
(laughter, chuckling)

1030
01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.947
EDMUND: I've never seen
these constellations before.

1031
01:05:48.073 --> 01:05:49.575
Me neither.

1032
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:52.661
We're a long way from home.

1033
01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:57.082
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing
to the end of the world...

1034
01:05:59.209 --> 01:06:00.544
...finding my father there.

1035
01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.299
Maybe you will.

1036
01:06:12.264 --> 01:06:13.640
(snoring)

1037
01:06:19.563 --> 01:06:21.565
I miss my mummy.

1038
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.529
I miss mine, too.

1039
01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:30.782
Don't worry, you'll see her again.

1040
01:06:30.866 --> 01:06:32.201
How do you know?

1041
01:06:32.284 --> 01:06:34.369
You just have to have faith
about these things.

1042
01:06:35.746 --> 01:06:37.247
Aslan will help us.

1043
01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.419
(sighs)

1044
01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.341
But Aslan couldn't stop
her from being taken.

1045
01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.344
We'll find her, I promise.

1046
01:06:51.803 --> 01:06:53.347
Somehow.

1047
01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:04.024
(waves breaking)

1048
01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:10.405
(breathing, growling)

1049
01:07:10.489 --> 01:07:11.949
Hmm...

1050
01:07:14.451 --> 01:07:17.371
(crying)

1051
01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:21.542
Trouble sleeping?

1052
01:07:22.876 --> 01:07:24.962
Now, now.

1053
01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:27.548
All is not as lost as it seems.

1054
01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:32.469
I'll stay up with you if you wish,
keep you company.

1055
01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:37.182
I'll wager you didn't even
believe in dragons this morning.

1056
01:07:37.266 --> 01:07:39.142
(chuckles)

1057
01:07:39.226 --> 01:07:40.310
Yes.

1058
01:07:41.645 --> 01:07:47.150
You know, extraordinary things
only happen to extraordinary people.

1059
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:50.279
Maybe it's a sign.

1060
01:07:51.655 --> 01:07:53.824
That you've got an extraordinary destiny.

1061
01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:56.785
Something...

1062
01:07:56.869 --> 01:07:59.538
something greater
than you could've imagined.

1063
01:07:59.621 --> 01:08:02.082
(chuckles)

1064
01:08:02.165 --> 01:08:05.627
I could tell you one or two
of my adventures, if you like,

1065
01:08:05.711 --> 01:08:07.921
just to pass the time.

1066
01:08:08.005 --> 01:08:11.758
Believe it or not, you're not
the first dragon I've encountered.

1067
01:08:11.842 --> 01:08:14.511
Many years ago--
too many than I care to mention--

1068
01:08:14.595 --> 01:08:16.430
I was with a band of pirates.

1069
01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:19.224
I met another dragon,
much fiercer than you...

1070
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:23.896
(Eustace snores deeply)

1071
01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:29.902
(gasps)

1072
01:08:29.985 --> 01:08:33.655
Lucy. Lucy, wake up.

1073
01:08:33.739 --> 01:08:35.824
-(Lucy gasps)
-Look!

1074
01:08:37.492 --> 01:08:38.827
The Blue Star.

1075
01:08:39.703 --> 01:08:41.830
-Everybody!
-What, what, what is it?

1076
01:08:41.914 --> 01:08:45.542
Everybody, wake up.
It's the Blue Star.

1077
01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:47.336
Come on, old boy, wake up.

1078
01:08:47.419 --> 01:08:48.504
(snorts)

1079
01:09:09.066 --> 01:09:10.817
(laughing)

1080
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:20.327
(mouthing)

1081
01:09:24.915 --> 01:09:27.292
-MAN: Pull!
-(rowers grunting

1082
01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:29.127
Mind your strokes there, lads.

1083
01:09:29.211 --> 01:09:30.921
Pull!

1084
01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:34.007
DRINIAN: The wind has left us.

1085
01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:36.677
So how do we get to
Ramandu's Island now then?

1086
01:09:38.679 --> 01:09:40.973
My guess is something
doesn't want us to get there.

1087
01:09:42.933 --> 01:09:45.018
-MAN: Pull!
-(rowers grunting)

1088
01:09:45.102 --> 01:09:46.520
All together!

1089
01:09:46.603 --> 01:09:50.357
If I get any hungrier,
I'm going to eat that dragon!

1090
01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:55.237
Don't worry, Eustace,
they'll have to deal with me first.

1091
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.738
-(Eustace growls)
-REEPICHEEP: Oh! Careful!

1092
01:09:56.822 --> 01:10:00.075
If we don't find land by tonight,
they may well eat that dragon.

1093
01:10:00.158 --> 01:10:02.035
(crewmen yelling)

1094
01:10:03.745 --> 01:10:05.247
(glass shatters)

1095
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.832
What did we hit?

1096
01:10:06.915 --> 01:10:08.876
(crew shouting)

1097
01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:13.463
Eustace, that's brilliant.

1098
01:10:15.257 --> 01:10:16.967
(Eustace grunts)

1099
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:22.848
Onward, ho!

1100
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:26.018
(cheering and applause)

1101
01:10:44.745 --> 01:10:47.915
We can't be sure the other lords
even made it to Ramandu's Island.

1102
01:10:59.593 --> 01:11:02.554
You got us there.
What did I tell you, Eustace?

1103
01:11:02.638 --> 01:11:04.431
Extraordinary. (laughs)

1104
01:11:04.515 --> 01:11:06.225
Extraordinary!

1105
01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:10.687
(birds squawking)

1106
01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:20.030
(creatures chittering)

1107
01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:33.085
(chittering, chirping,
squawking continue)

1108
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:00.779
Mmm, food.

1109
01:12:00.863 --> 01:12:02.072
Wait.

1110
01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:03.156
Huh?

1111
01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:15.836
(gasping)

1112
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.568
Lord Revilian.

1113
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:46.033
Lord Mavramorn.

1114
01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:52.080
Lord Argoz.

1115
01:12:53.248 --> 01:12:54.291
(breathing faintly)

1116
01:12:54.374 --> 01:12:55.542
(startled gasp)

1117
01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:02.132
He's breathing.

1118
01:13:08.722 --> 01:13:09.932
So are they.

1119
01:13:12.809 --> 01:13:14.269
They're under a spell.

1120
01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:18.065
-It's the food!
-Huh?

1121
01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:20.275
Oh!

1122
01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:22.736
Hey, it's the stone knife.

1123
01:13:23.654 --> 01:13:24.738
This is Aslan's table.

1124
01:13:25.906 --> 01:13:27.157
Their swords.

1125
01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:37.417
On the table.

1126
01:13:46.885 --> 01:13:48.387
That's six.

1127
01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:51.682
Still missing one.

1128
01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:57.771
Look!

1129
01:14:00.107 --> 01:14:01.733
(gentle whooshing)

1130
01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:27.801
Travelers of Narnia, welcome.

1131
01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:31.722
Arise.

1132
01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:36.143
Are you not hungry?

1133
01:14:36.727 --> 01:14:38.103
Who are you?

1134
01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:41.440
I'm Liliandil,
daughter of Ramandu.

1135
01:14:42.191 --> 01:14:43.817
I am your guide.

1136
01:14:47.738 --> 01:14:48.864
You're a star?

1137
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.165
You are most beautiful.

1138
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:02.085
I-If it is a distraction for you,
I-I can change form.

1139
01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:03.504
-No.
-No.

1140
01:15:05.047 --> 01:15:06.298
LILIANDIL: Please.

1141
01:15:08.467 --> 01:15:09.885
The food is for you.

1142
01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:14.348
There is enough for all who are
welcome at Aslan's table.

1143
01:15:15.599 --> 01:15:18.101
Always.
H-Help yourselves.

1144
01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.648
Wait! What happened to them?

1145
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:27.444
LILIANDIL: These poor men were half-mad
by the time they reached our shores.

1146
01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:29.905
They were threatening violence
upon each other.

1147
01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:33.200
Violence is forbidden
at the table of Aslan,

1148
01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:35.202
so they were sent to sleep.

1149
01:15:35.953 --> 01:15:37.412
Will they ever wake?

1150
01:15:38.372 --> 01:15:40.082
When all is put right.

1151
01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:42.501
Come, there is little time.

1152
01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:03.313
The magician, Coriakin,
told you of Dark Island?

1153
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:05.774
Yes.

1154
01:16:10.946 --> 01:16:13.198
Before long, the evil will be unstoppable.

1155
01:16:14.199 --> 01:16:15.826
Coriakin said to break its spell,

1156
01:16:15.909 --> 01:16:17.703
we lay the seven swords
at Aslan's table.

1157
01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:20.163
He speaks the truth.

1158
01:16:20.247 --> 01:16:21.748
But we only found six.

1159
01:16:22.583 --> 01:16:24.168
Do you know
where the seventh is?

1160
01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:27.754
In there.

1161
01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:29.715
You will need great courage.

1162
01:16:36.597 --> 01:16:37.806
Now, waste no time.

1163
01:16:41.101 --> 01:16:42.603
I hope we meet again.

1164
01:16:45.272 --> 01:16:46.565
Goodbye.

1165
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:57.993
(whooshing)

1166
01:17:01.663 --> 01:17:04.583
(rumbling)

1167
01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:15.093
So, what do you think is in there?

1168
01:17:16.136 --> 01:17:17.513
Our worst nightmares.

1169
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.140
Our darkest wishes.

1170
01:17:21.433 --> 01:17:22.935
Pure evil.

1171
01:17:26.188 --> 01:17:29.191
Tavros, unlock the armory.

1172
01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:30.484
My lord.

1173
01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:32.903
Archers, prepare yourselves.

1174
01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:34.196
CREWMAN: Aye, Captain.

1175
01:17:34.279 --> 01:17:35.906
Light the lanterns.

1176
01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:38.116
Let's get ready.

1177
01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:47.543
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you.

1178
01:17:55.634 --> 01:17:56.760
When you grow up...

1179
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.890
...you should be just like you.

1180
01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:14.528
In case we don't get through...
whatever this is...

1181
01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:18.699
...I want you to know I think
of you as my brother, Ed.

1182
01:18:19.324 --> 01:18:20.450
Me, too.

1183
01:18:25.956 --> 01:18:27.165
You gave up your sword.

1184
01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:29.835
It wasn't mine to keep.

1185
01:18:34.339 --> 01:18:35.549
Use this.

1186
01:18:36.967 --> 01:18:39.678
-But it's...
-Peter would want you to have it.

1187
01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:51.231
REEPICHEEP: There it is, my friend.

1188
01:18:51.315 --> 01:18:53.275
Our battle awaits.

1189
01:18:54.359 --> 01:18:57.696
Aah! Eustace, no! Halt!

1190
01:18:57.779 --> 01:18:59.740
Eustace, stop! Stop!

1191
01:18:59.823 --> 01:19:01.575
(yells)

1192
01:19:01.658 --> 01:19:04.494
I will not accept surrender.

1193
01:19:04.578 --> 01:19:07.289
A noble warrior does not run from fear.

1194
01:19:07.372 --> 01:19:10.209
Look at me!
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

1195
01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:14.838
I am a mouse.

1196
01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:16.840
You... you're a dragon.

1197
01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:19.801
You've got skin like chain mail.

1198
01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.512
You breathe fire.

1199
01:19:21.595 --> 01:19:23.764
Come on, let's meet our destiny.

1200
01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:33.857
CASPIAN: No matter what happens here,

1201
01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:36.443
every soul who stands before me
has earned their place

1202
01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:38.904
on the crew of the<i> Dawn Treader.</i>

1203
01:19:39.655 --> 01:19:42.115
Together we have traveled far.

1204
01:19:42.199 --> 01:19:43.992
Together we have faced adversity.

1205
01:19:44.076 --> 01:19:46.995
Together we can do it again.

1206
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:50.999
So now is not the time to fall
to fear's temptations.

1207
01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:53.627
Be strong. Never give in.

1208
01:19:54.753 --> 01:19:56.839
Our world--

1209
01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:59.091
our Narnian lives-- depend on it.

1210
01:20:00.467 --> 01:20:02.135
Think of the lost souls
we're here to save.

1211
01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:08.016
Think of Aslan.

1212
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:11.186
Think of Narnia.

1213
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:13.021
CREWMAN: For Narnia!

1214
01:20:13.105 --> 01:20:15.899
CREW: For Narnia! For Narnia!

1215
01:20:15.983 --> 01:20:17.609
For Narnia!

1216
01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:19.278
(crew shouting heartily)

1217
01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:22.322
For Narnia! For Narnia!

1218
01:20:27.703 --> 01:20:29.913
(rumbling)

1219
01:20:39.464 --> 01:20:42.301
(eerie voices whispering)

1220
01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:55.189
(whispering continues)

1221
01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:12.414
(woman laughing)

1222
01:21:13.582 --> 01:21:14.791
Helaine.

1223
01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:17.544
(echoing) Wait for me.

1224
01:21:25.886 --> 01:21:28.138
I can't see a thing.

1225
01:21:28.222 --> 01:21:29.890
This fog's too thick.

1226
01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:39.399
MAN: You are a great
disappointment to me.

1227
01:21:39.483 --> 01:21:41.818
You call yourself my son.

1228
01:21:42.569 --> 01:21:44.404
Then act like a king.

1229
01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:51.745
Edmund, come with me.

1230
01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:54.581
Be my king.

1231
01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:58.794
I'll let you rule.

1232
01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:01.755
Go away. You're dead.

1233
01:22:01.839 --> 01:22:03.632
You can never kill me.

1234
01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:09.805
I'll always be alive...
in your mind, silly boy.

1235
01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:12.182
-No!
-LUCY: Edmund.

1236
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:15.769
Are you all right?

1237
01:22:16.895 --> 01:22:17.896
Yeah.

1238
01:22:18.897 --> 01:22:21.024
(loud moaning in distance)

1239
01:22:27.197 --> 01:22:30.075
MAN: Keep away!

1240
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.246
Keep away!

1241
01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:35.664
EDMUND: Who's there?

1242
01:22:35.747 --> 01:22:37.207
CASPIAN: We do not fear you.

1243
01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:39.251
MAN: Nor I you!

1244
01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:50.888
Keep away!

1245
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:52.556
We will not leave.

1246
01:22:52.639 --> 01:22:54.850
You will not defeat me.

1247
01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:57.686
Caspian. Caspian, his sword.

1248
01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:01.565
Lord Rhoop.

1249
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:06.153
You do not own me!

1250
01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:08.155
Stand down.

1251
01:23:08.238 --> 01:23:09.907
Let's get him on board, quickly.

1252
01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:13.076
(roaring)

1253
01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:15.495
(screaming)

1254
01:23:19.917 --> 01:23:21.543
CASPIAN: Be calm, my lord.

1255
01:23:21.627 --> 01:23:23.629
Off me, demon!

1256
01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:25.005
No, my lord.

1257
01:23:25.088 --> 01:23:26.840
We are not here to hurt you.

1258
01:23:26.924 --> 01:23:29.259
I am your king, Caspian.

1259
01:23:30.427 --> 01:23:31.887
Caspian?

1260
01:23:34.056 --> 01:23:35.265
(gasps)

1261
01:23:35.891 --> 01:23:37.226
My lord!

1262
01:23:38.852 --> 01:23:41.772
You should not have come.
There's no way out of here.

1263
01:23:41.855 --> 01:23:45.442
Quickly, turn this ship about
before it's too late!

1264
01:23:45.526 --> 01:23:46.985
We have the sword. Let's go.

1265
01:23:47.069 --> 01:23:49.029
Let's turn her about, Drinian.

1266
01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:50.447
Aye, aye, Your Majesty.

1267
01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:51.657
Do not think.

1268
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:56.828
Do not let it know your fears,
or it will become them.

1269
01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:00.123
Oh, no.

1270
01:24:00.207 --> 01:24:03.335
Edmund, what did you just think of?

1271
01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:05.087
Oh, I'm sorry.

1272
01:24:14.096 --> 01:24:16.431
(banging, rumbling)

1273
01:24:16.515 --> 01:24:19.893
-(screams)
-(crew shouting)

1274
01:24:19.977 --> 01:24:21.144
Look!

1275
01:24:21.228 --> 01:24:22.771
What is that?

1276
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:26.733
It's too late.
It's too late!

1277
01:24:29.903 --> 01:24:31.738
It's gone under the boat.
It's gone under the boat!

1278
01:24:31.822 --> 01:24:34.783
-Gael!
-(Gael screams)

1279
01:24:36.952 --> 01:24:39.538
(shrieking)

1280
01:24:41.957 --> 01:24:44.418
Come here! Run!

1281
01:24:45.711 --> 01:24:48.839
Don't let me down!
No fear, no retreat!

1282
01:24:48.922 --> 01:24:51.133
(shrieking)

1283
01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:54.553
(Eustace roars)

1284
01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:00.726
-(roaring)
-For Narnia!

1285
01:25:00.809 --> 01:25:03.645
-Take that and that!
-(creature shrieking)

1286
01:25:03.729 --> 01:25:05.480
And... (grunts)

1287
01:25:05.564 --> 01:25:07.816
Eustace, hang on!

1288
01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:21.705
(roaring)

1289
01:25:31.715 --> 01:25:33.634
(creature shrieking)

1290
01:25:36.303 --> 01:25:38.013
Out, creature!

1291
01:25:38.096 --> 01:25:39.640
CASPIAN: No! The sword! The sword!

1292
01:25:39.723 --> 01:25:40.974
Eustace!

1293
01:25:42.351 --> 01:25:43.936
No! Come back!

1294
01:25:44.019 --> 01:25:45.938
RHOOP: We're all doomed! Doomed!

1295
01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:47.981
Turn this ship about!

1296
01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:50.359
Stop him! Someone stop him!

1297
01:25:50.442 --> 01:25:53.612
(ship rumbling, crew shouting)

1298
01:25:55.447 --> 01:25:57.157
(groans)

1299
01:25:57.241 --> 01:26:00.911
DRINIAN: Aft crew...
to your rowing positions.

1300
01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:03.288
Oars at double speed!

1301
01:26:03.372 --> 01:26:05.707
<i>LUCY: Aslan, please help us.</i>

1302
01:26:05.791 --> 01:26:07.918
(gull calling)

1303
01:26:12.548 --> 01:26:16.385
Pull! Pull!

1304
01:26:28.856 --> 01:26:30.357
(shrieking)

1305
01:26:35.487 --> 01:26:38.073
Pull! Put your back into it! Pull!

1306
01:26:39.157 --> 01:26:41.201
(crewman screams)

1307
01:26:41.285 --> 01:26:42.828
Gael, come on!

1308
01:26:42.911 --> 01:26:44.371
This way!

1309
01:26:44.454 --> 01:26:46.206
(crew yelling)

1310
01:26:51.003 --> 01:26:52.963
-(banging)
-(screaming)

1311
01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:57.718
(screams)

1312
01:26:59.678 --> 01:27:03.098
Now, you must stay here until someone
comes and gets you, Okay?

1313
01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:09.897
Ed! Ed.

1314
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.192
We ram the serpent--
smash him on the rocks.

1315
01:27:13.275 --> 01:27:16.236
Steer her to port!
I'll keep it on the prow!

1316
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.781
Look out!

1317
01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:26.455
Pull! Come on! Pull!

1318
01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:34.880
Try and kill me. Come on!

1319
01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:36.215
Come on. I'm here!

1320
01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:41.678
-No!
-Edmund!

1321
01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:45.265
(grunting)

1322
01:27:54.566 --> 01:27:57.861
DRINIAN: Archers, ready yourselves!

1323
01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:01.573
I'm still here!

1324
01:28:01.657 --> 01:28:03.450
(creature shrieks)

1325
01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:08.121
(shrieking)

1326
01:28:08.956 --> 01:28:11.333
CASPIAN: Brace yourselves!

1327
01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:13.126
(yelling)

1328
01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:14.962
(shrieks)

1329
01:28:16.004 --> 01:28:18.715
(grunting)

1330
01:28:20.133 --> 01:28:22.261
(creature shrieking)

1331
01:28:40.362 --> 01:28:41.780
(groans)

1332
01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.835
(roars)

1333
01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:10.142
(shrieking)

1334
01:29:14.688 --> 01:29:17.482
(creature shrieking)

1335
01:29:19.359 --> 01:29:21.278
(roars)

1336
01:29:24.948 --> 01:29:25.991
Move!

1337
01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:27.534
(shrieks)

1338
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.002
(shrieking)

1339
01:29:41.173 --> 01:29:42.633
We can beat this.

1340
01:30:00.817 --> 01:30:02.277
We have to get it closer.

1341
01:30:02.361 --> 01:30:05.781
-All hands to the main deck!
-Ready the harpoons!

1342
01:30:10.869 --> 01:30:13.413
DRINIAN: I want everybody up here!

1343
01:30:17.751 --> 01:30:19.628
-Ready?
-Aye, sir!

1344
01:30:19.711 --> 01:30:21.296
Now!

1345
01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:23.382
(all grunt)

1346
01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:25.509
(shrieking)

1347
01:30:27.052 --> 01:30:28.470
Pull its head down!

1348
01:30:34.685 --> 01:30:36.687
(blades ringing, clinking)

1349
01:30:39.398 --> 01:30:40.691
(ringing grows louder)

1350
01:30:42.359 --> 01:30:44.444
(grunts)

1351
01:30:44.528 --> 01:30:46.989
(shrieking)

1352
01:30:47.072 --> 01:30:49.575
(clattering)

1353
01:30:49.658 --> 01:30:51.702
-(shrieking)
-Heave!

1354
01:30:56.748 --> 01:30:58.709
(clattering continues)

1355
01:30:58.792 --> 01:31:00.544
(grunts)

1356
01:31:00.627 --> 01:31:02.421
WHITE WITCH (whispering): Edmund.

1357
01:31:07.676 --> 01:31:09.761
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?

1358
01:31:10.971 --> 01:31:12.264
That you're a man?

1359
01:31:13.974 --> 01:31:16.852
(swords clattering)

1360
01:31:18.437 --> 01:31:22.316
(muffled shouting)

1361
01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:27.821
I can make you that.
I can make you my king.

1362
01:31:30.490 --> 01:31:32.409
Just take my hand.

1363
01:31:32.492 --> 01:31:34.328
(snapping, cracking)

1364
01:31:34.411 --> 01:31:36.455
(yelling)

1365
01:31:46.548 --> 01:31:47.758
Just give in.

1366
01:31:56.934 --> 01:31:58.477
CASPIAN: Do it!

1367
01:31:59.269 --> 01:32:01.146
Come on!

1368
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:06.818
No!

1369
01:32:06.902 --> 01:32:09.071
-(crackling)
-(yelling)

1370
01:32:09.154 --> 01:32:12.866
(rumbling, crackling)

1371
01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:24.962
(deep rumbling)

1372
01:32:30.676 --> 01:32:32.386
(thunder rumbling)

1373
01:32:39.226 --> 01:32:42.729
The spell... it's lifting.

1374
01:32:46.441 --> 01:32:47.484
Edmund!

1375
01:32:49.444 --> 01:32:51.238
LUCY: Caspian!

1376
01:32:51.321 --> 01:32:52.614
Look!

1377
01:33:07.421 --> 01:33:08.964
(blades ringing)

1378
01:33:15.679 --> 01:33:17.389
(ringing stops)

1379
01:33:21.476 --> 01:33:25.105
-CASPIAN: Narnians! Narnians!
-(cheering and applause)

1380
01:33:39.494 --> 01:33:41.997
-Mummy!
-Helaine!

1381
01:33:50.756 --> 01:33:53.425
Rhince! Gael!

1382
01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:54.927
GAEL: Mummy!

1383
01:33:55.719 --> 01:33:57.179
Mummy.

1384
01:33:59.723 --> 01:34:00.766
Mummy!

1385
01:34:06.688 --> 01:34:09.024
Let's help them on board!
Clear the decks!

1386
01:34:12.152 --> 01:34:14.071
We did it.

1387
01:34:14.154 --> 01:34:16.073
I knew we would.

1388
01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:17.491
It wasn't just us, though.

1389
01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.494
-You mean...
-EUSTACE: Hey!

1390
01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:22.871
Hey! I'm down here, Lucy!

1391
01:34:22.955 --> 01:34:24.414
Over here!

1392
01:34:24.498 --> 01:34:26.708
Hey, Lucy, I'm in the water! Lucy!

1393
01:34:26.792 --> 01:34:28.460
Eustace.

1394
01:34:28.544 --> 01:34:31.463
I'm a boy again. I'm a boy!

1395
01:34:31.547 --> 01:34:34.466
Eustace! I see your wings
have been clipped.

1396
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:35.884
(laughs)

1397
01:34:38.262 --> 01:34:40.597
<i>♪ Where sky and water meet ♪</i>

1398
01:34:40.681 --> 01:34:42.516
<i>♪ Where the waves</i>
<i>grow ever sweet... ♪</i>

1399
01:34:43.851 --> 01:34:45.894
It is sweet. It's sweet!

1400
01:34:45.978 --> 01:34:47.688
(chuckling)

1401
01:34:48.438 --> 01:34:50.524
Look! Look!

1402
01:34:57.948 --> 01:34:59.157
Aslan's country.

1403
01:35:00.242 --> 01:35:01.702
We must be close.

1404
01:35:02.619 --> 01:35:04.705
Well, we've come this far.

1405
01:35:17.134 --> 01:35:20.220
EDMUND: So what was it like
when Aslan changed you back?

1406
01:35:21.722 --> 01:35:25.809
EUSTACE: No matter how hard I tried,
I just couldn't do it myself.

1407
01:35:25.893 --> 01:35:27.603
Then he came towards me.

1408
01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:30.814
It sort of hurt, but it was a good pain.

1409
01:35:31.899 --> 01:35:34.735
You know, like when you pull
a thorn from your foot.

1410
01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:38.530
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.

1411
01:35:38.614 --> 01:35:41.742
I mean, I think I was a better dragon
than I was a boy, really.

1412
01:35:43.076 --> 01:35:44.870
I'm so sorry for being such a sop.

1413
01:35:45.537 --> 01:35:46.955
It's okay, Eustace.

1414
01:35:47.998 --> 01:35:49.416
You are a pretty good dragon.

1415
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:56.757
My friends, we have arrived.

1416
01:36:34.419 --> 01:36:35.462
Aslan.

1417
01:36:36.964 --> 01:36:39.675
Welcome, children.
You have done well.

1418
01:36:39.758 --> 01:36:41.844
Very well indeed.

1419
01:36:41.927 --> 01:36:46.306
You have come far,
and now your journey is at its end.

1420
01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.308
Is this your country?

1421
01:36:48.392 --> 01:36:50.978
No, my country lies beyond.

1422
01:36:54.231 --> 01:36:56.024
Is my father in your country?

1423
01:36:56.108 --> 01:36:59.444
You can only find that out
for yourself, my son.

1424
01:37:00.404 --> 01:37:02.823
But you should know
that if you continue,

1425
01:37:02.906 --> 01:37:04.408
there is no return.

1426
01:37:37.191 --> 01:37:38.734
You're not going?

1427
01:37:38.817 --> 01:37:40.736
I can't imagine my father
would be very proud

1428
01:37:40.819 --> 01:37:42.905
that I gave up what he died for.

1429
01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:49.369
I spent too long wanting what was
taken from me and not what was given.

1430
01:37:50.704 --> 01:37:52.372
I was given a kingdom.

1431
01:37:53.957 --> 01:37:55.125
A people.

1432
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:03.717
I promise to be a better king.

1433
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.802
You already are.

1434
01:38:07.429 --> 01:38:08.722
Children.

1435
01:38:09.598 --> 01:38:12.518
I think perhaps it's time
we went home, actually, Lu.

1436
01:38:15.103 --> 01:38:16.855
But I thought you loved it here.

1437
01:38:16.939 --> 01:38:18.774
I do.

1438
01:38:18.857 --> 01:38:22.152
But I love home and our family as well.

1439
01:38:24.821 --> 01:38:26.406
They need us.

1440
01:38:28.659 --> 01:38:30.202
(Reepicheep clears his throat)

1441
01:38:34.498 --> 01:38:37.751
Your Eminence,
ever since I can remember,

1442
01:38:37.835 --> 01:38:40.212
I have dreamt of seeing your country.

1443
01:38:40.295 --> 01:38:43.298
I've had many great adventures
in this world,

1444
01:38:43.382 --> 01:38:46.426
but nothing has dampened
that yearning.

1445
01:38:47.135 --> 01:38:48.887
I know I am hardly worthy,

1446
01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:52.975
but with your permission,
I would lay down my sword

1447
01:38:53.058 --> 01:38:57.646
for the joy of seeing
your country with my own eyes.

1448
01:39:01.108 --> 01:39:05.404
My country was made for
noble hearts such as yours,

1449
01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:08.240
no matter how small
their bearers be.

1450
01:39:08.949 --> 01:39:09.950
Your Majesty.

1451
01:39:10.033 --> 01:39:11.660
No one could be more deserving.

1452
01:39:11.743 --> 01:39:13.453
-Well, I...
-EDMUND: It's true.

1453
01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:28.510
May I?

1454
01:39:29.469 --> 01:39:32.723
Well, I suppose.
Just this... ooh!

1455
01:39:32.806 --> 01:39:34.516
(anxious chuckle)

1456
01:39:38.187 --> 01:39:39.438
Goodbye, Lucy.

1457
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:57.331
Don't cry.

1458
01:39:57.414 --> 01:39:59.333
I don't understand.

1459
01:40:01.919 --> 01:40:03.795
Will I not see you again?

1460
01:40:03.879 --> 01:40:05.255
Ever?

1461
01:40:05.339 --> 01:40:08.342
What a magnificent puzzle you are...

1462
01:40:08.425 --> 01:40:10.010
and a true hero.

1463
01:40:10.093 --> 01:40:14.139
It has been my honor to fight
beside such a brave warrior...

1464
01:40:14.223 --> 01:40:15.891
and a great friend.

1465
01:40:28.195 --> 01:40:29.947
I won't be needing this.

1466
01:40:57.766 --> 01:41:00.060
This is our last time here, isn't it?

1467
01:41:00.143 --> 01:41:04.064
Yes. You have grown up, my dear one.

1468
01:41:05.023 --> 01:41:07.234
Just like Peter and Susan.

1469
01:41:07.317 --> 01:41:09.361
Will you visit us in our world?

1470
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.990
I shall be watching you, always.

1471
01:41:15.701 --> 01:41:16.994
How?

1472
01:41:17.494 --> 01:41:20.747
In your world, I have another name.

1473
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:23.125
You must learn to know me by it.

1474
01:41:23.208 --> 01:41:26.503
That was the very reason
you were brought to Narnia.

1475
01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:29.298
That by knowing me here for a little,

1476
01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:31.717
you may know me better there.

1477
01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:34.469
Will we meet again?

1478
01:41:34.553 --> 01:41:37.431
Mm... yes, dear one.

1479
01:41:37.514 --> 01:41:39.224
One day.

1480
01:41:40.851 --> 01:41:42.603
(roars)

1481
01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:56.575
You're the closest thing I have to family.

1482
01:41:58.869 --> 01:42:01.205
And that includes you, Eustace.

1483
01:42:01.288 --> 01:42:02.748
(quiet laugh)

1484
01:42:02.831 --> 01:42:04.333
Thank you.

1485
01:42:18.931 --> 01:42:20.599
(sobbing softly)

1486
01:42:32.653 --> 01:42:34.029
Will I come back?

1487
01:42:34.112 --> 01:42:37.324
Narnia may yet have need of you.

1488
01:43:34.298 --> 01:43:35.757
ALBERTA: Eustace?

1489
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.762
Eustace, what are you doing up there?

1490
01:43:40.846 --> 01:43:43.724
Jill Pole's dropped in for a visit.

1491
01:43:55.152 --> 01:43:58.071
<i>EUSTACE: We spoke often of Narnia</i>

1492
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:04.661

1493
01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:09.082

1494
01:44:10.959 --> 01:44:13.504
<i>As I know all Narnians will miss them...</i>

1495
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:16.006
