PETER: All right. I'm gonna
turn over the next card.

8
00:02:36.648 --> 00:02:38.595
I want you to concentrate.

9
00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:41.572
I want you to tell me
what you think it is.

10
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.447
Square.

11
00:02:48.513 --> 00:02:50.832

Clear your head.

14
00:03:04.112 --> 00:03:07.512
All right. Tell me
what you think it is.

15
00:03:08.783 --> 00:03:10.476
Is it a star?

16
00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:15.308
It is a star. Very good.
That's great.

17
00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:18.226
Okay. All right.

18
00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:22.402
Think hard. What is it?

19
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:25.066
Circle.

20
00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:29.158
Close. But definitely wrong.

22
00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.957
Okay.

23
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:36.874
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:36.937 --> 00:03:38.414
All right.

25
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:41.754
What is it?

26
00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:45.470
Come on.

27
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:48.598
Figure eight.

28
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:54.851
Incredible. That's 5 for 5.
You can't see these, can you?

29
00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:58.984
- You're not cheating me, are you?
- No, I swear they're just coming to me.

30
00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.277
Okay.

31
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.901
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

32
00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:12.324
You only have 75 more to
go, okay? What's this one?

33
00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:17.827
It's a couple of wavy lines.

34
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:21.794
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

35
00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:23.959
Um...

36
00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:26.385
Wait... Um...

(MUMBLING)

38
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:31.849
I'm getting a little tired of this!

39
00:04:31.908 --> 00:04:34.511
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying you, aren't we?

40
00:04:34.577 --> 00:04:37.931
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna be giving me electric shocks!

41
00:04:37.998 --> 00:04:40.146
What are you trying to
prove here, anyway?

42
00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:44.279
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

43
00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:47.907
The effect? I'll tell you what the
effect is. It's pissing me off!

44
00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:49.909
Well, then maybe my
theory is correct!

45
00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:53.868
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister!

46
00:04:57.726 --> 00:05:00.545
You may as well get used to that.

47
00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:05.463
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability is going to provoke in some people.

48
00:05:05.692 --> 00:05:08.887
Do you think I have it,
Dr. Venkman?

49
00:05:10.113 --> 00:05:12.682
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

50
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:15.310
This is it. This is definitely it!

51
00:05:15.368 --> 00:05:17.846
Did those UV lenses come
in for the video camera?

52
00:05:17.912 --> 00:05:21.562
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

53
00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:24.853
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

54
00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:29.532
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

55
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:31.411
I need a little more
time with this subject.

56
00:05:31.426 --> 00:05:34.029
Could you come back in an
hour, hour and a half?

57
00:05:34.095 --> 00:05:36.197
Peter, at 1:40 p.m.

58
00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:39.789
at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue,

59
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:44.673
ten people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

60
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:47.004
It blew books off shelves
from 20 feet away

61
00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:49.545
and scared the socks off
some poor librarian.

62
00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.930
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

63
00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:56.013
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

64
00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:59.020
No, Peter, you're coming with us on
this one. Spengler went down there.

65
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.228
He took PKE valences, went right
off the top of the scale.

66
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.736
Buried the needle. We're close
on this one. I can feel it.

67
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:13.327
I can feel it. We're
very, very close.

68
00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:18.532
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

69
00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:20.871
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say at...?

70
00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.411
Eight o'clock?

71
00:06:22.477 --> 00:06:27.458
I was just going to say, "8:00?"
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

72
00:06:30.402 --> 00:06:31.845
As a friend, I have to tell you,

73
00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.730
you've finally gone around the
bend on this ghost business.

74
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:36.339
You guys have been
running your ass off,

75
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.500
meeting and greeting every
schizo in the five boroughs

76
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.705
who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

77
00:06:41.746 --> 00:06:42.989
Of course, you forget, Peter,

78
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.543
I was present at an undersea,
unexplained mass sponge migration.

79
00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:51.857
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

- Oh, you're here.
- Yeah, what have you got?

83
00:06:59.848 --> 00:07:03.168
This is big, Peter, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

84
00:07:03.226 --> 00:07:07.081
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

85
00:07:07.147 --> 00:07:09.295
- Remember that?
- That would've worked if...

86
00:07:09.357 --> 00:07:12.381
I'm Roger Delacorte. Are you
the men from the university?

87
00:07:12.444 --> 00:07:16.139
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

88
00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:20.302
Thank you for coming. I hope we can
clear this up quickly and quietly.

89
00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:24.814
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

90
00:07:25.415 --> 00:07:27.313
I don't remember seeing any legs,

91
00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:30.649
but it definitely had arms,
because it reached out for me.

92
00:07:30.712 --> 00:07:32.940
Arms? I can't wait to get
a look at this thing.

93
00:07:33.006 --> 00:07:35.905
Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

94
00:07:36.301 --> 00:07:38.403
Have you or any
member of your family

95
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.666
ever been diagnosed schizophrenic,
mentally incompetent?

96
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.586
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

97
00:07:47.645 --> 00:07:50.544
I'd call that a big yes.

98
00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:55.008
Uh, are you habitually using
drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

99
00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:58.469
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

100
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.140
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

101
00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:07.479
- What has that got to do with it?
- Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

102
00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:10.773

Look!

106
00:08:42.784 --> 00:08:46.730
- This is hot, Ray.
- Symmetrical book-stacking.

107
00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:50.813
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

108
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.230
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

RAY: Ectoplasmic residue.

113
00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:21.097
- Venkman, get a sample of this.
- It's the real thing.

114
00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:23.599
Somebody blows their nose,
and you wanna keep it?

115
00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:25.431
I'd like to analyze it.

00:11:04.592 --> 00:11:07.866

- It was scientific.
- I just got overexcited.

153
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:27.776
But wasn't it incredible, Pete? I mean,
we actually touched the etheric plane.

154
00:12:27.842 --> 00:12:30.036
You know what this could
mean to the university?

155
00:12:30.094 --> 00:12:32.538
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the
microchip. Ray, I'm very excited.

156

I wouldn't say the experience
was completely wasted.

157
00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:37.418
According to these new readings,
I think we have an excellent chance

158
00:12:37.477 --> 00:12:39.250
of actually catching a ghost
and holding it indefinitely.

159
00:12:39.312 --> 00:12:43.417
Well, this is great. If the ionization rate
is constant for all ectoplasmic entities,

160
00:12:43.483 --> 00:12:46.803
we could really bust some heads.
In a spiritual sense, of course.

this catching a ghost?

No, you're being moved off campus.

168

The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

169
00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:21.336
You are to vacate these

I demand an explanation.

00:13:24.565 --> 00:13:27.669
Fine. This university
will no longer continue

172
00:13:27.735 --> 00:13:31.180
any funding of any kind for
your group's activities.

173
00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.012
But the kids love us.

174
00:13:33.074 --> 00:13:39.307
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

175
00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:44.023
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

176
00:13:44.126 --> 00:13:46.604
Your theories are the worst
kind of popular tripe.

177
00:13:46.671 --> 00:13:50.116
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

178
00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:53.744
You are a poor scientist,
Dr. Venkman.

179
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.367
I see.

180
00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.377
And you have no place in this
department or in this university.

181
00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:04.793
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

182
00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:07.379
They wouldn't touch us with
a 10-meter cattle prod.

183
00:14:07.441 --> 00:14:09.885
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

184
00:14:09.944 --> 00:14:12.888
Einstein did his best stuff when
he was working as a patent clerk.

185
00:14:12.947 --> 00:14:14.890
- You know how much a patent clerk earns?
- No

186
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:17.401
Personally, I like the university.
They gave us money and facilities.

187
00:14:17.402 --> 00:14:18.749
We didn't have to produce anything.

188
00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:21.838
You've never been out of college. You
don't know what it's like out there.

189
00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:25.364
I've worked in the private
sector. They expect results.

190
00:14:25.626 --> 00:14:27.569
For whatever reasons, Ray,

191
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:32.822
call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma,

192
00:14:32.884 --> 00:14:35.828
I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

193
00:14:35.887 --> 00:14:40.083
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

194
00:14:40.182 --> 00:14:45.254
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

195
00:14:49.108 --> 00:14:51.664
This ecto-containment system that
Spengler and I have in mind is gonna

196
00:14:51.665 --> 00:14:55.786
require a load of bread to capitalize.
Where are we gonna get the money?

197
00:14:57.325 --> 00:15:01.100
I don't know. I don't know.

198
00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:05.350
You're never gonna
regret this, Ray.

199
00:15:05.416 --> 00:15:08.110
My parents left me that
house. I was born there.

200
00:15:08.169 --> 00:15:11.523
You're not gonna lose the house.
Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

201
00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:14.363
But at 19 percent? You didn't
even bargain with the guy.

202
00:15:14.425 --> 00:15:17.028
Ray, for your information,
the interest rate alone

203
00:15:17.094 --> 00:15:19.947
for the first five years
comes to 95,000 dollars.

204
00:15:20.014 --> 00:15:23.118
Will you guys relax? We are on
the threshold of establishing

205
00:15:23.225 --> 00:15:26.374
the indispensable defense
science of the next decade:

206
00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:30.132
Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

207
00:15:30.232 --> 00:15:34.963
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

208

quarters and showers on the next floor

209

on the top level.

210
00:15:40.117 --> 00:15:45.144
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

211
00:15:45.247 --> 00:15:47.145
What do you think, Egon?

212
00:15:47.249 --> 00:15:49.568
I think this building
should be condemned.

213
00:15:49.627 --> 00:15:52.276
There's serious metal fatigue in
all the load-bearing members.

214
00:15:52.338 --> 00:15:56.068
The wiring is substandard. It's completely
inadequate for our power needs.

215
00:15:56.133 --> 00:15:59.157
And the neighborhood is
like a demilitarized zone.

You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

219

No, no, I'm fine. I feel great.

I taped <i>20-Minute Workout</i> on my
machine and played it back at high speed

229
00:17:26.242 --> 00:17:28.515
so it only took 10 minutes.
I got a great workout.

to go to rehearsal now. Excuse me.

No sweat. I'll take a

return, which you shouldn't do,

239
00:17:49.265 --> 00:17:51.225
I'd like you to stop by, being
that you're my neighbor and all.

Well, thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

That's strange. I didn't
realize I left it on.

244
00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:04.305
Oh, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on
the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable

245
00:18:04.364 --> 00:18:07.889
but I couldn't get in, so you know what
I did? I turned up my TV real loud too

TVs had something wrong with them.

00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:46.428
I see.

332
00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:52.560
That's the bedroom. But nothing
ever happened in there.

333
00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:57.645
What a crime.

334
00:24:59.462 --> 00:25:02.566

act like a scientist.

- You're more like a game-show host.

336
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.162
That's the kitchen, huh?

337
00:25:28.366 --> 00:25:30.560
- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

338
00:25:30.618 --> 00:25:33.892
See I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells

339
00:25:33.955 --> 00:25:36.649
- and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

340
00:25:36.708 --> 00:25:40.938
And that's when I started to hear that
awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

341
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.451
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?

342
00:25:47.802 --> 00:25:51.281
Better check the fridge. Good call.

- No. Goddamn it! This wasn't...
- You actually eat this stuff?

346
00:26:04.861 --> 00:26:06.838
Look, this wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

347
00:26:06.905 --> 00:26:10.635
There was a space and there was a building
or something with flames coming out of it.

348
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.521
And there were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

349
00:26:14.621 --> 00:26:17.474
And there were flames, and I
heard a voice say, "Zuul."

350
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.983
It was right here.

351

getting any reading.

Well, are you sure you're
using that thing correctly?

353
00:26:24.255 --> 00:26:28.360
I think so. But I'm sure there
are no animals in there.

354
00:26:28.426 --> 00:26:29.869
Well, that's great.

355
00:26:29.928 --> 00:26:33.623
Either I have a monster in my
kitchen, or I'm completely crazy.

I don't think you're crazy.

357

Oh, good. That makes
me feel so much better.

358
00:26:41.898 --> 00:26:43.671
Let me tell you
something about myself.

359
00:26:43.733 --> 00:26:46.962
I come home from work to my
place, and all I have is my work.

360
00:26:47.028 --> 00:26:48.675
- There's nothing else in my life.
- Dr. Venkman.

361
00:26:48.738 --> 00:26:53.139
I meet you, and I say, "My God, there's
someone with the same problem I have."

362
00:26:53.201 --> 00:26:56.145
Yes, we both have the
same problem. You.

363
00:26:59.749 --> 00:27:02.022
I'm gonna go for broke.

364
00:27:04.587 --> 00:27:07.566
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

365
00:27:07.674 --> 00:27:10.323
Will you please leave?

366
00:27:10.468 --> 00:27:13.868
And then she threw me out of her
life. She thought I was a creep.

367
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.034
She thought I was a geek, and
she probably wasn't the first.

368

369

- No.
- I've got it!

- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
- Okay.

373
00:27:33.783 --> 00:27:37.558
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done."

374
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.722
- "I wonder what makes him tick."
- I wonder.

in knowing what makes me tick."

cross the stream.

500
00:37:08.107 --> 00:37:12.383
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

501
00:37:12.445 --> 00:37:15.924
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

502
00:37:16.031 --> 00:37:19.135
All right, I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

503
00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:21.892
I looked at the trap, Ray.

504
00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:26.480
Turn your streams off as soon as I close
the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

505
00:37:26.542 --> 00:37:28.565
Now!

506
00:37:46.979 --> 00:37:48.422
It's in there.

507
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:50.208
Hey.

508
00:37:51.609 --> 00:37:53.962
Well, that wasn't such
a chore, now, was it?

509
00:37:56.014 --> 00:37:58.412
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

510
00:37:58.474 --> 00:38:00.372
Donald, stand over there.

511
00:38:00.894 --> 00:38:03.747
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

512
00:38:03.813 --> 00:38:05.335
Did you see it? What is it?

513
00:38:05.398 --> 00:38:06.841
We got it.

514
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.002
What is it? Will there
be any more of them?

515
00:38:09.068 --> 00:38:12.092
Sir, what you had there was
what we refer to as a focused,

516
00:38:12.155 --> 00:38:16.010
non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

517
00:38:16.075 --> 00:38:17.893
Real nasty one too.

518
00:38:17.952 --> 00:38:19.895
And now,

519
00:38:19.954 --> 00:38:22.678
let's talk seriously. Now,
for the entrapment...

520
00:38:22.704 --> 00:38:25.961
we're gonna have to ask you for
four big ones, $4000 for that.

521
00:38:26.002 --> 00:38:30.782
But we are having a special this week on
proton charging and storage of the beast.

522
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.443
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

523
00:38:33.509 --> 00:38:37.204
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

524
00:38:37.263 --> 00:38:39.598
That's all right. We can just
put it right back in there.

525
00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:41.576
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

526
00:38:41.643 --> 00:38:45.293
No! All right! Anything.

527
00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:46.798
Thanks so much.

528
00:38:46.856 --> 00:38:48.754
Thank you. Hope we
can help you again.

529
00:38:48.858 --> 00:38:51.757
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

530
00:38:51.861 --> 00:38:55.056
<i>Good Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today the entire Eastern seaboard</i>

531
00:38:55.114 --> 00:38:58.263
<i>is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.</i>

532

<i>have been reported across
the entire tri-state area.</i>

534
00:39:04.207 --> 00:39:06.856
Everybody has heard ghost
stories around the campfire.

535
00:39:06.918 --> 00:39:10.192
Heck, my grandma used to spin
yarns about a spectral locomotive

536
00:39:10.254 --> 00:39:12.857
that would rocket past the
farm where she grew up.

537
00:39:12.924 --> 00:39:15.118
But now, as if some
unforeseen authority...

538
00:39:15.426 --> 00:39:17.199

Stand aside, please!

541
00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:40.260
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic today, ghosts and ghostbusting.

542
00:39:40.326 --> 00:39:42.975
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

543
00:39:43.037 --> 00:39:44.639
Some maintain that these

544
00:39:44.706 --> 00:39:48.527
professional paranormal eliminators
in New York are the cause of it all.

545
00:39:53.923 --> 00:39:55.320
I got it! I got it!

546
00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:58.323
Pete! Ray!

547
00:40:07.145 --> 00:40:09.565
<i>CASEY KASEM: Still making

Twenty-four hours a day,

554
00:40:26.956 --> 00:40:29.730
No job is too big.
No fee is too big.

555
00:40:31.085 --> 00:40:33.688
Is it just a mist, or does
it have arms and legs?

556
00:40:33.755 --> 00:40:36.483
<i>As they say in TV, I'm sure

560
00:41:29.811 --> 00:41:32.380
mental telepathy,
ESP, clairvoyance,

561

spirit photography,
telekinetic movement,

562
00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:40.631
full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

563
00:41:40.696 --> 00:41:44.926
Uh, if there's a steady paycheck in
it, I'll believe anything you say.

564
00:41:46.035 --> 00:41:49.105
RAY:
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

565
00:41:49.163 --> 00:41:50.685
You don't look good.

566
00:41:50.748 --> 00:41:52.771
- I don't?
- Well, you've looked better.

567
00:41:52.834 --> 00:41:54.607
You didn't used to look like this.

568
00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:56.692
Can you hold, please?

569
00:41:56.754 --> 00:41:59.448
Here's the paper on the
Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.

570
00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:01.743
Here's tonight's worksheet.

571
00:42:01.801 --> 00:42:03.574
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

572
00:42:03.636 --> 00:42:06.740
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

573
00:42:06.806 --> 00:42:09.785
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

574
00:42:09.851 --> 00:42:13.251
- Congratulations.
- Can you help me, please?

575
00:42:16.566 --> 00:42:18.168
Welcome aboard.

576
00:42:19.277 --> 00:42:22.274
I don't know where they get these
guest conductors. I mean...

577
00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.941
someone should tell him it's not gonna
do much good to scream at us in German.

578
00:42:24.982 --> 00:42:28.261
Well, I don't think that the
man is competent to conduct

579
00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:29.895
a major symphony orchestra.

580
00:42:30.121 --> 00:42:36.228
- Um, could you wait here a minute?
- Huh? Uh, sure.

581
00:42:41.507 --> 00:42:43.780
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

582
00:42:43.843 --> 00:42:46.287
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.
- You heard that?

583
00:42:46.345 --> 00:42:48.368
Yes. You're the best
one in your row.

584
00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:49.999
Oh, thank you.

585
00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:53.703
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

586
00:42:53.769 --> 00:42:55.604
Ah, I don't have to take
this abuse from you.

587
00:42:55.605 --> 00:42:57.958
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

588
00:42:58.024 --> 00:43:00.172
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

589
00:43:00.234 --> 00:43:03.554
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

590
00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:09.552
Who's the stiff?

591
00:43:09.952 --> 00:43:13.272
The stiff happens to be one of the
finest musicians in the world.

592
00:43:13.331 --> 00:43:15.274
Do you have some information
for me, please?

593
00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:17.982
PETER: Well, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

594
00:43:18.044 --> 00:43:21.489
- DANA: Why don't you tell me now?
- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

595
00:43:21.547 --> 00:43:27.154
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

596
00:43:27.428 --> 00:43:29.530
What's that word?

597
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.286
- "Hittites."
- Hittites,

598
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:34.544
the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

599
00:43:35.353 --> 00:43:37.922
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

600
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.299
What's Gozer?

601
00:43:40.358 --> 00:43:44.679
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

602
00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:47.841
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night,

603
00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:51.352
I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

604
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.752
- I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.
- Miss Barrett...

605
00:43:55.778 --> 00:43:59.298
you seem to think there is something
wrong up here that says, in your mind:

606
00:43:59.335 --> 00:44:02.735
"He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

607
00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:07.573
No. I'm making a special exception
in your case because...

608
00:44:07.802 --> 00:44:09.245
I respect you.

609
00:44:09.303 --> 00:44:12.592
It's corny, but I respect you as
an artist. And as a dresser too.

610
00:44:12.618 --> 00:44:15.602
This is a magnificent coordination
you have going here today.

611
00:44:15.685 --> 00:44:17.028
I'll see you Thursday.

612
00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:20.356
I'll bring the <i>Roylance Guide
</i> and we'll eat and read.

613
00:44:27.196 --> 00:44:29.515
- So who the hell is that?
- He's just a friend.

614
00:44:29.573 --> 00:44:31.095
- A friend?
- An old friend.

615
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.927
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

616
00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:36.815
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

617
00:44:36.872 --> 00:44:39.851
You're still very pale,
though. A little sun.

618
00:44:39.917 --> 00:44:42.691
- Well, what does he do?
- He's a scientist.

619
00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:58.207
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

620
00:44:58.269 --> 00:45:03.751
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

621
00:45:03.816 --> 00:45:05.259
Insert the trap.

622
00:45:07.028 --> 00:45:09.096
Release.

623
00:45:09.864 --> 00:45:13.639
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

624
00:45:13.743 --> 00:45:15.265
Neutronize your field.

625
00:45:15.494 --> 00:45:17.392
And...

626
00:45:17.455 --> 00:45:20.183
when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

627
00:45:20.249 --> 00:45:23.319
The ghost is incarcerated here in
our custom-made storage facility.

628
00:45:23.377 --> 00:45:27.072
There's a man from the EPA here to
see you. He's waiting in your office.

629
00:45:27.131 --> 00:45:29.859
- EPA? What's he want?
- I don't know.

630
00:45:29.925 --> 00:45:33.029
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break,

631
00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:35.914
and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

632
00:45:35.973 --> 00:45:38.417
Janine, someone with
your qualifications

633
00:45:38.476 --> 00:45:42.456
would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either

634
00:45:42.521 --> 00:45:45.465
the food service or
housekeeping industries.

635
00:45:46.108 --> 00:45:50.304
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit better jobs than this.

636
00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:52.928
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

637
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.684
- Can I help you?
- I'm Walter Peck.

638
00:45:55.785 --> 00:45:59.515
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

639
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.183
Great. How's it going down there?

640
00:46:04.335 --> 00:46:06.403
Are you Peter Venkman?

641
00:46:07.296 --> 00:46:08.989
Yes, I'm...

642
00:46:09.048 --> 00:46:10.491
Dr. Venkman.

643
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:13.448
Exactly what are you a
doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

644
00:46:13.511 --> 00:46:17.036
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in
parapsychology and psychology.

645
00:46:17.681 --> 00:46:19.624
I see.

646
00:46:19.683 --> 00:46:22.662
And now you catch ghosts.

647
00:46:22.728 --> 00:46:24.830
Yeah. You could say that.

648
00:46:25.189 --> 00:46:27.838
And how many ghosts have
you caught, Mr. Venkman?

649
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.674
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put

650
00:46:30.736 --> 00:46:33.715
these ghosts once you catch them?

651
00:46:33.823 --> 00:46:36.346
Into a storage facility.

652
00:46:36.617 --> 00:46:39.846
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

653
00:46:39.912 --> 00:46:44.688
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

654
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.229
No. And why not, Mr. Venkman?

655
00:46:49.672 --> 00:46:53.026
Because you did not
use the magic word.

656
00:46:55.177 --> 00:46:58.952
What is the magic
word, Mr. Venkman?

657
00:47:00.182 --> 00:47:01.625
"Please."

658
00:47:02.893 --> 00:47:06.748
May I please see the storage
facility, Mr. Venkman?

659
00:47:06.856 --> 00:47:08.624
Why do you want to see
the storage facility?

660
00:47:08.682 --> 00:47:10.880
Well, because I'm curious.

661
00:47:11.068 --> 00:47:13.466
I want to know more
about what you do here.

662
00:47:13.946 --> 00:47:16.469
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media

663
00:47:16.532 --> 00:47:21.061
and we want to assess any possible
environmental impact from your operation.

For instance, the
presence of noxious,

665

chemicals in your basement.

there, or I come back with a court order.

something big on the horizon.

01:00:18.422 --> 01:00:20.650
Are you the Gatekeeper?

834
01:00:23.552 --> 01:00:25.996
You better bring him inside.

835
01:00:27.014 --> 01:00:29.617
You are so kind to
take care of that man.

836
01:00:29.683 --> 01:00:31.660
You know, you are a
real humanitarian.

837
01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:34.296
I don't think he's human.

838
01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:43.801
What did you say your name was?

839
01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.013
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

840
01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:49.349
According to this, his
name's Louis Tully.

841
01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:51.934
Lives on Central Park West.

842
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.109
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

843
01:00:56.251 --> 01:00:58.319
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

844
01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.818
Yes, have some.

845
01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:05.198
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

846
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:08.113
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

847
01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.533
He will come in one of
the pre-chosen forms.

848
01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:14.954
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large Torb.

849
01:01:15.437 --> 01:01:18.882
Then, during the third reconciliation of
the last of the Meketrex supplicants,

850
01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:22.386
they chose a new form for
him, that of a giant Sloar!

851
01:01:22.444 --> 01:01:25.047
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew
what it was to be roasted

852
01:01:25.155 --> 01:01:27.883
in the depths of the Sloar
that day, I can tell you.

853
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:31.395
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

854
01:01:33.288 --> 01:01:36.562
There's something very
strange about that man.

855
01:01:38.669 --> 01:01:41.522
Listen, I'm usually very psychic,
and I have a terrible feeling

856
01:01:41.588 --> 01:01:44.783
that something awful is
gonna happen to you.

857
01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:48.279
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

858
01:01:48.721 --> 01:01:50.073
(PHONE RINGS)

859
01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.866
I'll get it.

860
01:01:54.476 --> 01:01:56.829
- Hello?
<i>- PETER: Egon, it's Peter.</i>

861
01:01:56.895 --> 01:02:00.249
- Thanks, I've got it.
- I have news from the world of Gozer.

862
01:02:00.315 --> 01:02:03.589
<i>- What is it, Peter?</i>
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.

863
01:02:03.652 --> 01:02:06.380
It seems the Goz has
been putting some moves

864
01:02:06.447 --> 01:02:09.596
- on my would-be girlfriend.
<i>- How is she?</i>

865
01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:13.262
I think we can get her a
guest shot on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

866
01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:16.398
I just whacked her up with
about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

867
01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:20.687
She's gonna take a little nap now,
but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

868
01:02:20.753 --> 01:02:23.276
- Does that make any sense to you?
<i>- Some.</i>

869
01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:26.032
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

870
01:02:26.091 --> 01:02:28.944
Oh, wonderful. We have to
get these two together.

871
01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:33.869
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

872
01:02:33.932 --> 01:02:37.377
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

873
01:02:37.436 --> 01:02:39.755
Good.

874
01:02:39.813 --> 01:02:44.840
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find
Ray. I need him here immediately.

875
01:02:49.281 --> 01:02:52.806
Bad news, honey,
I gotta go to work.

876
01:02:52.868 --> 01:02:55.847
Hey, will you stay here
in bed until I get back?

877
01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:05.773

878
01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:08.658
WINSTON:
Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?

879
01:03:08.717 --> 01:03:09.818
RAY: Never met him.

880
01:03:09.885 --> 01:03:14.491
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

881
01:03:14.556 --> 01:03:18.627
This roof cap is made of a
magnesium-tungsten alloy.

882
01:03:18.685 --> 01:03:21.129
What are you so
involved with there?

883
01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:23.447
These are the blueprints for
the structural ironwork

884
01:03:23.473 --> 01:03:27.415
in Dana Barrett's apartment building,
and they're very, very strange.

885
01:03:27.653 --> 01:03:31.303
Hey, Ray, do you remember
something in the Bible about

886
01:03:31.365 --> 01:03:35.470
the last days, when the dead
would rise from the grave?

887
01:03:35.786 --> 01:03:38.685
I remember Revelations 7:12.

888
01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:41.309
And I looked as he
opened the sixth seal.

889
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:43.443
And behold, there was
a great earthquake.

890
01:03:43.502 --> 01:03:46.025
And the sun became as
black as sackcloth.

891
01:03:46.296 --> 01:03:47.943
And the moon became as blood.

892
01:03:48.006 --> 01:03:51.030
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

893
01:03:52.719 --> 01:03:55.698
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

894
01:03:55.764 --> 01:03:58.868
Every ancient religion has its own
myth about the end of the world.

895
01:03:58.934 --> 01:04:02.709
Myth? Ray, has it
ever occurred to you

896
01:04:02.813 --> 01:04:05.041
that maybe the reason
we've been so busy lately

897
01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:08.336
is because the dead have
been rising from the grave?

898
01:04:13.323 --> 01:04:17.929
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

899
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.018

01:04:56.742 --> 01:04:58.389
This way.

901
01:05:06.835 --> 01:05:08.149
Excuse me.

902
01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:11.431
Excuse me. Just where do
you think you're going?

903
01:05:11.465 --> 01:05:14.739
Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested
for interfering with the police...

904
01:05:14.801 --> 01:05:17.450
Oh, no. Hold on. I've seen TV.
I know you can't come in here

905
01:05:17.512 --> 01:05:19.180
without a warrant or
a writ or something.

906
01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:22.410
Cease and Desist All Commerce order.
Seizure of Premises and Chattels.

907

Ban on the use of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers

908

and a federal Entry
and Inspection order.

909
01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:31.551
Vinz, there's one more
test I'd like to perform.

910
01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:35.965
JANINE: Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

911
01:05:36.031 --> 01:05:39.806
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

912
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:42.729
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines would be extremely hazardous.

913
01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:45.448
I'll tell you what's hazardous.
You're facing federal prosecution

914
01:05:45.457 --> 01:05:47.776
for at least a half a dozen
environmental violations.

915
01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:50.534
Now, either you shut off these
beams, or we shut them off for you.

916
01:05:55.133 --> 01:05:58.077
Try to understand, this is a
high-voltage laser containment system.

917
01:05:58.136 --> 01:06:00.989
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

918
01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:04.501
Don't patronize me. I'm not grotesquely
stupid, like the people you bilk.

919
01:06:04.559 --> 01:06:06.233
At ease, officer.
I'm Peter Venkman.

920
01:06:06.259 --> 01:06:08.145
I think there's just been a
slight misunderstanding,

921
01:06:08.146 --> 01:06:10.340
and I want to cooperate
in any way that I can.

922
01:06:10.399 --> 01:06:12.922
Forget it, Venkman. You had
your chance to cooperate,

923
01:06:12.985 --> 01:06:16.840
but you thought it'd be more fun to
insult me. Now it is my turn, wiseass.

924
01:06:16.905 --> 01:06:19.007
He wants to shut down the
protection grid, Peter.

925
01:06:19.074 --> 01:06:21.895
You shut that thing down, and we are
not gonna be held responsible...

926
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:25.765
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off.
- No, we won't be held responsible.

927
01:06:25.831 --> 01:06:28.935
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

928
01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.688
I've never seen anything like
this before. I don't know...

929
01:06:32.754 --> 01:06:36.358
Yeah, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

930

- My friend, don't be a jerk.
- Step aside.

931

you can shoot him.

Don't tell me how to do mine.

No. Nobody ever
made them like this.

You never studied.

The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna

968
01:11:19.457 --> 01:11:21.980
that was designed and built
expressly for the purpose

01:11:22.043 --> 01:11:25.317
of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

She's not my girlfriend.
I find her interesting because

972
01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.852
she's a client and because
she sleeps above her covers.

973
01:11:38.893 --> 01:11:42.998
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

Something terrible is
about to enter our world,

976
01:11:47.756 --> 01:11:51.972
and this building is obviously the door.
The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.

977
01:11:52.032 --> 01:11:55.762
I found it in <i>Tobin's Spirit Guide.</i>
He was also a doctor.

978
01:11:55.827 --> 01:11:58.430
He performed a lot of
unnecessary surgery.

979
01:11:58.496 --> 01:12:01.475
And then, in 1920, he
started a secret society.

01:12:01.541 --> 01:12:05.441
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

No studying.

982
01:12:07.881 --> 01:12:13.533
After the first World War, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

983
01:12:16.931 --> 01:12:20.205
And he wasn't alone. He had close to
a thousand followers when he died.

984
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.333
They conducted rituals
up on the roof,

985
01:12:22.395 --> 01:12:26.045
bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

986
01:12:26.107 --> 01:12:29.211
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

01:12:44.793 --> 01:12:48.147
that some moldy Babylonian god is
gonna drop in on Central Park West

993
01:12:48.213 --> 01:12:51.408
- and start tearing up the city?
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.

994
01:12:51.466 --> 01:12:54.240
- Yeah, big difference.
- No offense,

995
01:12:54.344 --> 01:12:56.071
but I gotta get my own lawyer.

996
01:12:56.137 --> 01:12:58.865
Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor
wants to see you guys.

997
01:12:58.932 --> 01:13:00.955
The whole island's
going crazy. Let's go.

998
01:13:01.142 --> 01:13:04.246
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

1001
01:13:28.169 --> 01:13:31.944
- I am the Keymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

1002
01:14:14.374 --> 01:14:19.025
- Back. Back. Stay back.
- Stay back. Stay back.

1003
01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:29.139
I've got a city blowing up, and you
guys are not giving me any answers.

1004
01:14:29.239 --> 01:14:32.309
We're blocking the
bridges, the roads...

1005
01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:33.969
The Ghostbusters are
here, Mr. Mayor.

1006
01:14:34.035 --> 01:14:36.888
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

1007
01:14:36.955 --> 01:14:38.648
Hey, and where's this Peck?

1008
01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:42.903
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I'm prepared to make a full report.

1009
01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:45.439
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

1010
01:14:45.505 --> 01:14:48.404
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

1011
01:14:48.466 --> 01:14:51.911
People think they're seeing ghosts,
and they call these bozos,

1012
01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:54.493
who conveniently show up
to deal with the problem

1013
01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.499
with a fake electronic light show.

1014
01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:59.502
Everything was fine with our
system until the power grid

1015
01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:03.291
- was shut off by dickless here.
- They caused an explosion.

1016
01:15:03.356 --> 01:15:08.587
- Is this true?
- Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

1017
01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:14.142
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up!

1018
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.143
- All right.
- Well, that's what I heard.

1019
01:15:16.202 --> 01:15:17.770
MAYOR: This is City Hall.

1020
01:15:17.829 --> 01:15:20.978
Now, what am I gonna do
here, John? What is this?

1021
01:15:21.041 --> 01:15:23.860
All I know is that was no light
show we saw this morning.

1022
01:15:23.918 --> 01:15:27.943
I've seen every form of
combustion known to man,

1023
01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:29.983
but this beats the hell out of me.

1024
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:32.619
The walls in the 53rd
Precinct were bleeding.

1025
01:15:32.677 --> 01:15:35.280
- How do you explain that?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1026
01:15:35.347 --> 01:15:37.040
Oh, Your Eminence.

1027
01:15:42.896 --> 01:15:45.624
- How are you, Lenny?
- You're looking good, Mike.

1028
01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.385
We're in a real fix here. What
do you think I should do?

1029
01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:52.468
Lenny, officially, the church
will not take any position

1030
01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:56.009
on the religious implications
of these phenomena.

1031
01:15:56.076 --> 01:15:57.678
Personally, Lenny...

1032
01:15:58.036 --> 01:16:02.061
I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

1033
01:16:02.332 --> 01:16:03.957
PETER:
I think that's a smart move, Mike.

1034
01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:05.731
I'm not gonna call
a press conference

1035
01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:08.734
and tell everyone to start praying.

1036
01:16:08.838 --> 01:16:10.360
Uh...

1037
01:16:10.632 --> 01:16:13.531
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

1038
01:16:13.593 --> 01:16:16.071
Look, I've only been with the
company for a couple weeks.

1039
01:16:16.137 --> 01:16:18.911
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

1040
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:23.086
Since I joined these men, I have
seen shit that'll turn you white.

1041
01:16:23.853 --> 01:16:25.580
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

1042
01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:28.250
- My name is Peck.
- Or you could accept the fact

1043
01:16:28.358 --> 01:16:31.837
that this city is headed for a
disaster of biblical proportions.

1044
01:16:31.903 --> 01:16:35.724
- Well, what do you mean, "biblical"?
- What he means is Old Testament.

1045
01:16:35.782 --> 01:16:38.010
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
- Exactly.

1046
01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:41.601
Fire and brimstone coming down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

1047
01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:44.232
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

Dead rising from the grave.

1049
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:46.942
Human sacrifice.

1050
01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:49.945
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

1051
01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:52.277
Enough! I get the point.

1052
01:16:54.008 --> 01:16:55.451
But what if you're wrong?

1053
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.955
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

1054
01:16:59.013 --> 01:17:02.617
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right,

1055
01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:05.958
and we can stop this thing...

1056
01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:11.547
Lenny, you will have
saved the lives

of millions of registered voters.

1058
01:17:21.327 --> 01:17:25.307
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

1059
01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:35.150
Get him out of here.

1060
01:17:35.216 --> 01:17:37.944
- Bye.
- I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

1061
01:17:38.011 --> 01:17:40.955
I'm gonna get you a nice fruit
basket. I'm going to miss him.

01:17:41.014 --> 01:17:42.536
All right. All right.

1063
01:17:42.974 --> 01:17:46.453

what do you need from me?

Oh, very cute.

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:53.018
(ROARING)

1161
01:30:59.921 --> 01:31:02.115
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

1162
01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:22.710
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1163
01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.720
I tried to think of the
most harmless thing.

1164
01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.881
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1165
01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:31.895
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1166
01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:34.055
Nice thinking, Ray.

1167
01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:37.058
We used to roast Stay
Puft marshmallows

1168
01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:39.068
by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1169
01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:45.074
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1170
01:31:45.299 --> 01:31:50.576
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1171
01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:03.585
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

1172
01:32:08.239 --> 01:32:10.888
Nobody steps on a
church in my town.

1173
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:14.020
One, two, three, roast him.

1174
01:32:33.723 --> 01:32:35.450
Funny, us going out like this.

1175
01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.960
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1176
01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:41.320
We've been going about this all wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is okay. He's a sailor.

1177
01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:45.301
He's in New York. We get this guy
laid, we won't have any trouble.

1178
01:32:49.113 --> 01:32:52.262
I have a radical idea. The
door swings both ways.

1179
01:32:52.325 --> 01:32:54.928
We could reverse the particle
flow through the gate.

1180
01:32:54.994 --> 01:32:56.937
RAY: How?

1181
01:32:56.996 --> 01:32:59.315
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1182
01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:01.271
You said crossing the
streams was bad.

1183
01:33:01.334 --> 01:33:04.563
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1184
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:06.481
You're gonna endanger our client,

1185
01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:09.651
the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1186
01:33:09.759 --> 01:33:13.955
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1187
01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:23.415
I love this plan. I'm excited to
be a part of it. Let's do it.

1188
01:33:23.481 --> 01:33:27.302
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1189
01:33:30.822 --> 01:33:32.424
Hurry.

1190
01:33:34.283 --> 01:33:36.761
See you on the other side, Ray.

1191
01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:41.687
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1192
01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.697
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1193
01:33:54.846 --> 01:33:57.199
Now, Spengler!

1194
01:34:02.395 --> 01:34:04.372
Get out of here!

1195
01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:56.557
(GROANING)

1196
01:34:57.450 --> 01:34:59.848
- RAY: Winston.
- WINSTON: Yeah.

1197
01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:01.763
- RAY: Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1198
01:35:06.876 --> 01:35:08.444
Venkman?

1199
01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:09.945
Spengler!

1200
01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:12.440
Venkman!

1201
01:35:15.676 --> 01:35:17.278
Spengler.

1202
01:35:18.596 --> 01:35:21.540
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1203
01:35:21.599 --> 01:35:23.793
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1204
01:35:23.893 --> 01:35:26.121
- Venky!
- PETER: Yeah, where are you?

1205
01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:28.631
Oh, thank God.

1206
01:35:29.649 --> 01:35:31.467
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1207
01:35:31.525 --> 01:35:33.093
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1208
01:35:33.152 --> 01:35:35.550
- You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?

1209
01:35:35.613 --> 01:35:37.215
Fine.

1210
01:35:44.288 --> 01:35:48.484
RAY: Oh, it smells like
barbecued dog hair.

1211
01:35:48.876 --> 01:35:50.944
Oh, Venkman.

1212
01:35:51.003 --> 01:35:53.322
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1213
01:35:53.923 --> 01:35:56.947
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

1214
01:36:11.232 --> 01:36:12.925
Look!

1215
01:36:13.985 --> 01:36:16.087
(♪♪)

1216
01:36:39.969 --> 01:36:42.868
Somebody turn on the lights!

1217
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.159
- Help! Somebody!
- Go check on that little guy.

1218
01:36:51.564 --> 01:36:53.587
What happened?

1219
01:37:00.114 --> 01:37:04.560
Oh. Oh. Where am I?

1220
01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:09.516
Oh, hi.

1221
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.733
EGON: You'll be all right.

1222
01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:15.730
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1223
01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.154
Are you okay?

1224
01:37:19.717 --> 01:37:21.694
Who are you guys?

1225
01:37:21.761 --> 01:37:23.909
We're the Ghostbusters.

1226
01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.162
Who does your taxes?

1227
01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:32.038
RAY: You know, Mr. Tully, you are
a most fortunate individual.

1228
01:37:32.104 --> 01:37:34.502
- I know.
- You have been a participant in

1229
01:37:34.565 --> 01:37:38.260
the biggest interdimensional cross rip
since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1230
01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:40.592
- Felt great.
- We'd like to get a sample

1231
01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:43.633
- of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1232
01:37:46.577 --> 01:37:49.396
