00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:44.586
<i>All right.</i>

2
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.029
<i>I'm gonna turn over the next card.</i>

3
00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:50.073
<i>I want you to concentrate.</i>

4
00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:53.370
<i>I want you to tell me
what you think it is.</i>

5
00:02:58.793 --> 00:03:00.036
Square.

6
00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:02.251
Good guess.
But wrong.

7
00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:13.560
Clear your head.

8
00:03:15.613 --> 00:03:18.712
All right.
Tell me what you think it is.

9
00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:22.230
Is it a star?

10
00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:26.487
It is a star.
Very good. That's great.

11
00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:29.725
Okay. All right.

12
00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.026
Think hard.
What is it?

13
00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:36.579
Circle.

14
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:40.305
Close.
But definitely wrong.

15
00:03:42.843 --> 00:03:44.552
Okay.

16
00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:48.271
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

17
00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:49.851
All right.

18
00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:53.316
What is it?

19
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:57.119
Come on.

20
00:03:58.295 --> 00:04:00.169
Figure eight.

21
00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:04.747
Incredible.
That's 5 for 5.

22
00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.642
- You can't see these, can you?
- No, no.

23
00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:09.906
- You're not cheating me, are you?
- No, I swear they're just coming to me.

24
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:12.700
Okay.

25
00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:18.621
- Nervous?
- Yes. I don't like this.

26
00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:23.387
You only have 75 more to go.
Okay? What's this one?

27
00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:29.428
It's a couple of wavy lines?

28
00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:32.797
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day.
- I know.

29
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.266
Wait, I...
Um...

30
00:04:41.938 --> 00:04:43.242
Getting a little tired of this.

31
00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:45.912
You volunteered, didn't you?
We're paying, aren't we?

32
00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:49.332
Yeah, but I didn't know you were
gonna give me electric shocks.

33
00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.684
What are you trying
to prove here, anyway?

34
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.855
I'm studying the effect of negative
reinforcement on ESP ability.

35
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.535
The effect? I'll tell you what
the effect is. It's pissing me off.

36
00:04:59.723 --> 00:05:01.302
Well, then maybe
my theory is correct.

37
00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:04.312
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it.
- I will, mister.

38
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.637
You may as well get
used to that.

39
00:05:12.494 --> 00:05:16.293
It's the kind of resentment that your
ability is gonna provoke in some people.

40
00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.694
Do you think I have it,
Dr. Venkman?

41
00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:23.630
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

42
00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:27.233
This is it.
This is definitely it.

43
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.498
Did those UV lenses come in
for the video camera?

44
00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:32.361
And that blank tape, I need it,
the one you erased yesterday.

45
00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:36.097
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Sure.

46
00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:40.475
I'm right in the middle
of something, Ray.

47
00:05:41.283 --> 00:05:45.604
Uh, I need more time with this subject.
Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half?

48
00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:47.782
Peter, at 1:40 p.m...

49
00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:51.370
...at the main branch of The New York
Public Library on Fifth Avenue...

50
00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:56.358
...10 people witnessed a free-floating,
full-torso, vaporous apparition.

51
00:05:56.406 --> 00:06:00.659
It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away
and scared the socks off some poor librarian.

52
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.584
I'm very excited.
I'm very pleased.

53
00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:07.076
I want you to get right down there,
check it out, and get back to me.

54
00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:08.326
- No, no...
- Get right back to me.

55
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:10.603
Peter, you're coming with us on this one.
Spengler went down there.

56
00:06:10.638 --> 00:06:13.659
He took PKE valences,
went right off the top of the scale.

57
00:06:13.837 --> 00:06:17.713
Buried the needle.
We're close on this one. I can feel it.

58
00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:24.384
I can feel it.
We're very, very close.

59
00:06:26.922 --> 00:06:29.932
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd
like to work with you some more.

60
00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:32.382
Perhaps you could come back
this evening, say, at...

61
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:33.802
Eight o'clock?

62
00:06:33.978 --> 00:06:37.101
I was just going to say,
eight o'clock?

63
00:06:37.317 --> 00:06:39.261
You are a legitimate phenomenon.

64
00:06:42.241 --> 00:06:46.329
As a friend, I must say you've finally gone
around the bend on this ghost business.

65
00:06:46.332 --> 00:06:50.335
You guys been ruining your ass off meeting
and greeting every schizo in the five boroughs...

66
00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.064
...who says he has a paranormal
experience. What have you seen?

67
00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:57.793
Of course, you forget, Peter. I was there at an
undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.

68
00:06:58.377 --> 00:07:02.990
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated
about a foot and a half.

69
00:07:09.507 --> 00:07:11.203
- Oh, you're here.
- Yeah, what have you got?

70
00:07:11.349 --> 00:07:14.660
This is big, Peter, this is very big.
There's definitely something here.

71
00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:18.481
Egon, this reminds me of the time you
tried to drill a hole through your head.

72
00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:20.596
- Remember that?
- That would've worked if you hadn't stopped me.

73
00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.778
Oh, hi, I'm Roger Delacorte.
Are you the men from the university?

74
00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:27.899
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Stantz. Egon.

75
00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:31.705
Thank you for coming. I hope we
can clear this up quickly and quietly.

76
00:07:31.904 --> 00:07:35.617
Let's not rush things. We don't
even know what you have yet.

77
00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:42.046
I don't remember seeing any legs, but it definitely
had arms, because it reached out for me.

78
00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:44.515
Arms? I can't wait
to get a look at this thing.

79
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.746
Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple
of standard questions, okay?

80
00:07:47.802 --> 00:07:53.796
Have you or any member of your family ever been
diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?

81
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.670
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:59.343 --> 00:08:01.411
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:08:03.109 --> 00:08:06.585
Are you habitually using drugs,
stimulants, alcohol?

84
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.239
- No.
- No, no. Just asking.

85
00:08:10.465 --> 00:08:13.411
Are you, Alice,
menstruating right now?

86
00:08:13.703 --> 00:08:15.965
What has that
got to do with it?

87
00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:19.229
Back off, man.
I'm a scientist.

88
00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:21.707
Ray, it's moving.
Come on.

89
00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:38.707
Correction & Arrangement by BANQUO
(alacayel@gmail.com)

90
00:08:47.465 --> 00:08:48.783
Look.

91
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:58.150
- This is hot, Ray.
- Symmetrical book-stacking.

92
00:08:58.289 --> 00:09:01.494
Just like the Philadelphia
mass turbulence of 1947.

93
00:09:02.619 --> 00:09:06.422
You're right. No human being
would stack books like this.

94
00:09:07.355 --> 00:09:10.626
Listen.
Do you smell something?

95
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:22.313
Talk about telekinetic activity.
Look at this mess.

96
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.073
Raymond, look at this.

97
00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.064
Ectoplasmic residue.

98
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:30.435
Venkman, get a sample of this.

99
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:32.615
It's the real thing.

100
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:36.443
- Somebody blows their nose, and you wanna keep it?
- I'd like to analyze it.

101
00:09:36.894 --> 00:09:40.039
- There's more over here.
- I'm getting stronger readings here.

102
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:48.649
This way.

103
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.213
Come on.

104
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:04.322
Egon, your mucus.

105
00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:13.855
This happen to you before?

106
00:10:15.962 --> 00:10:17.527
First time?

107
00:10:42.964 --> 00:10:44.478
It's here.

108
00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:49.395
A full torso apparition.
And it's real.

109
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:56.321
So, what do we do?

110
00:11:01.489 --> 00:11:04.267
Could you come over here
and talk to me for a second, please?

111
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:06.542
Could you just come here
for a second, please?

112
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:09.638
Right over here.
Come here, Francine. Come here.

113
00:11:10.947 --> 00:11:13.359
- What do we do?
- I don't know. What do you think?

114
00:11:14.088 --> 00:11:15.791
Stop that.

115
00:11:16.423 --> 00:11:19.463
We've gotta make contact.
One of us should actually try to speak to it.

116
00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:21.103
Good idea.

117
00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:31.295
Hello.

118
00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.668
I'm Peter.

119
00:11:34.153 --> 00:11:37.111
Where are you from?
Originally.

120
00:11:42.521 --> 00:11:45.530
All right. Okay.
The usual stuff isn't working.

121
00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:49.332
<i>Okay, I have a plan.
I know exactly what to do.</i>

122
00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:53.831
Now, stay close.

123
00:11:54.499 --> 00:11:56.300
Stay close.

124
00:11:56.823 --> 00:11:59.646
I know.
Do exactly as I say.

125
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:02.115
Get ready.
Ready?

126
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.323
Get her.

127
00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:15.152
- Did you see it? What was it?
- We'll get back to you.

128
00:12:15.365 --> 00:12:16.726
What?

129
00:12:25.923 --> 00:12:29.509
Get her. That was your whole plan.
Get her.

130
00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:34.709
- It was scientific.
- I just got overexcited.

131
00:12:35.343 --> 00:12:39.342
But wasn't it incredible, Pete? I mean,
we actually touched the etheric plane.

132
00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:40.929
You know what this could mean
in the university?

133
00:12:40.944 --> 00:12:43.873
Yeah, that'd be bigger than microchip.
Ray, I'm very excited.

134
00:12:43.876 --> 00:12:45.995
I wouldn't say the experience
was completely wasted.

135
00:12:46.037 --> 00:12:48.389
According to these new readings,
I think we have an excellent chance...

136
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.842
...of actually catching a ghost
and holding it indefinitely.

137
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:52.136
Well, this is great.

138
00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:55.180
If the ionization rate is
constant for all ectoplasmic entities...

139
00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:56.739
...we could really bust some heads.

140
00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.557
In a spiritual sense,
of course.

141
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.045
Spengs, you serious
about this catching a ghost?

142
00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:03.203
I'm always serious.

143
00:13:04.198 --> 00:13:07.071
Egon, I'm gonna take back some
of the things I've said about you.

144
00:13:09.755 --> 00:13:12.225
You... You've earned it.

145
00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:16.192
<i>The possibilities are limitless.</i>

146
00:13:16.748 --> 00:13:18.461
Hey, Dean Yeager.

147
00:13:22.255 --> 00:13:24.638
I trust you're moving us
to better quarters on campus.

148
00:13:24.775 --> 00:13:26.970
No, you're being moved off campus.

149
00:13:27.057 --> 00:13:29.827
The Board of Regents has decided
to terminate your grant.

150
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:32.640
You are to vacate
these premises immediately.

151
00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:36.091
This is preposterous.
I demand an explanation.

152
00:13:36.126 --> 00:13:37.291
Fine.

153
00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:42.466
This university will no longer continue any
funding of any kind for your group's activities.

154
00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:44.081
But the kids love us.

155
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:50.760
Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose
of science is to serve mankind.

156
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:55.185
You, however, seem to regard science
as some kind of dodge or hustle.

157
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.169
Your theories are the worst kind
of popular tripe.

158
00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:01.509
Your methods are sloppy, and your
conclusions are highly questionable.

159
00:14:01.515 --> 00:14:04.794
You are a poor scientist,
Dr. Venkman.

160
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:07.767
I see.

161
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:12.233
And you have no place in this
department, or in this university.

162
00:14:13.112 --> 00:14:16.735
This is a major disgrace.
Forget MIT or Stanford now.

163
00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:18.776
They wouldn't touch us
with a 10-meter cattle prod.

164
00:14:18.843 --> 00:14:21.342
You're always so concerned
about your reputation.

165
00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:24.396
Einstein did his best stuff
when he was a patent clerk.

166
00:14:24.448 --> 00:14:26.412
- You know how much a patent clerk earns?
- No.

167
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.279
Personally, I like the university.
They gave us money and facilities.

168
00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:30.656
We didn't have to produce anything.

169
00:14:30.659 --> 00:14:33.220
You've never been out of college.
You don't know what it's like out there.

170
00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:36.899
I've worked in the private sector.
They expect results.

171
00:14:37.156 --> 00:14:38.963
For whatever reasons, Ray...

172
00:14:39.171 --> 00:14:44.383
...call it fate, call it luck,
call it karma...

173
00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:47.417
...I believe that everything
happens for a reason.

174
00:14:47.452 --> 00:14:51.704
I believe that we were destined
to get thrown out of this dump.

175
00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:56.416
- For what purpose?
- To go into business for ourselves.

176
00:15:00.745 --> 00:15:05.184
This ecto-containment system Spengler and I have
in mind is gonna require a load of bread to capitalize.

177
00:15:05.219 --> 00:15:06.749
Where are we gonna
get the money?

178
00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:10.689
I don't know.

179
00:15:11.224 --> 00:15:12.687
I don't know.

180
00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:16.841
You're never gonna
regret this, Ray.

181
00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.720
My parents left me that house.
I was born there.

182
00:15:19.755 --> 00:15:23.223
You're not gonna lose the house.
Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

183
00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:25.973
But at 19 percent?
You didn't even bargain with the guy.

184
00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:31.612
Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone
for the first five years comes to 95,000 dollars.

185
00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:34.665
Will you guys relax? We are
on the threshold of establishing...

186
00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:37.918
...the indispensable defense science
of the next decade:..

187
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:41.828
...Professional paranormal
investigations and eliminations.

188
00:15:41.893 --> 00:15:46.497
The franchise rights alone will make
us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

189
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.809
<i>There's office space, sleeping quarters
and showers on the next floor...</i>

190
00:15:49.867 --> 00:15:51.652
<i>...and there's a full kitchen
on the top level.</i>

191
00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:56.525
It just seems a little pricey for a unique
fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

192
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:58.529
What do you think, Egon?

193
00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:01.183
I think this building
should be condemned.

194
00:16:01.218 --> 00:16:03.836
There's serious metal fatigue
in all the load-bearing members.

195
00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:07.673
The wiring is substandard. It's completely
inadequate for our power needs.

196
00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:10.581
And the neighborhood
is like a demilitarized zone.

197
00:16:10.721 --> 00:16:13.409
Hey, does this pole still work?

198
00:16:16.602 --> 00:16:20.875
Wow, this place is great.
When can we move in?

199
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:24.382
You gotta try this pole.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

200
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.805
Hey, we should stay here, tonight,
sleep here.

201
00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:33.824
You know, to try it out.

202
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:45.588
- I think we'll take it.
- Good.

203
00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:21.681
Oh, hi.

204
00:17:27.113 --> 00:17:29.383
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Oh, hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

205
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.060
- I thought it was the drugstore.
- Oh, are you sick?

206
00:17:32.094 --> 00:17:34.070
Oh, no, no, I'm fine.
I feel great.

207
00:17:34.105 --> 00:17:37.422
Just ordered some more vitamins
and stuff. I was just exercising.

208
00:17:37.457 --> 00:17:41.343
I taped 20-Minute Workout on my machine and played
it back at high speed, so it only took 10 minutes.

209
00:17:41.346 --> 00:17:42.759
- I got a great workout.
- Good.

210
00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:44.131
Want to come in
for a mineral water?

211
00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:47.851
Oh, I'd really like to... um... Louis, but I have
to go to rehearsal now. Excuse me.

212
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.193
No sweat.

213
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:50.236
I'll take a rain check on that.

214
00:17:50.301 --> 00:17:53.779
I always have plenty of low-sodium mineral
water and other nutritious foods in the house.

215
00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:55.913
- But you already know that.
- Yeah, I know that.

216
00:17:55.948 --> 00:17:59.139
Listen, that reminds me, I'm having
a big party for all my clients.

217
00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:00.914
It's my fourth anniversary
as an accountant, you know.

218
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.164
And even though you do your own
tax return, which you shouldn't do...

219
00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.070
...I'd like you to stop by, being
that you're my neighbor and all.

220
00:18:05.075 --> 00:18:07.581
Well, thank you, Louis.
I'll really try to stop by.

221
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.541
Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't
leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

222
00:18:10.544 --> 00:18:12.703
The creep down the hall
phoned the manager.

223
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.089
That's strange.
I didn't realize I left it on.

224
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:18.247
Oh, yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on
the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable...

225
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:19.990
...but I couldn't get in,
so you know what I did?

226
00:18:20.035 --> 00:18:21.891
I turned up my TV real loud too...

227
00:18:21.894 --> 00:18:25.322
...so everyone would think that both our
TVs had something wrong with them.

228
00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:28.351
Okay, so I'll see you later, huh?
I'll give you a call.

229
00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:31.999
I gotta have a shower.

230
00:18:36.391 --> 00:18:39.095
Are you troubled by strange noises
in the middle of the night?

231
00:18:39.699 --> 00:18:42.657
Do you experience feelings of dread
in your basement or attic?

232
00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:46.183
Have you or any of your family ever
seen a spook, specter or ghost?

233
00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:48.286
If the answer is yes,
then don't wait another minute.

234
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:50.218
Pick up your phone
and call the professionals.

235
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:51.624
Ghostbusters.

236
00:18:51.627 --> 00:18:54.180
<i>Our courteous and efficient
staff is on call 24 hours a day...</i>

237
00:18:54.218 --> 00:18:56.638
...to serve all your
supernatural-elimination needs.

238
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:59.493
We're ready to believe you.

239
00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:14.124
Zuul.

240
00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:18.836
<i>You don't think
it's too subtle, Marty?</i>

241
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:22.686
<i>You don't think people are gonna
drive down and not see the sign?</i>

242
00:20:31.178 --> 00:20:32.955
You can't park that here.

243
00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:39.792
Everybody can relax,
I found the car.

244
00:20:39.973 --> 00:20:42.472
Needs some suspension work
and shocks...

245
00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:46.705
...and brakes, brake pads, linings,
steering box, transmission, rear end.

246
00:20:46.708 --> 00:20:48.565
- How much?
- Only 4800.

247
00:20:48.639 --> 00:20:51.383
Maybe new rings, also mufflers,
a little wiring.

248
00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.612
- Janine, any calls?
- No.

249
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.763
- Any messages?
- No.

250
00:21:01.673 --> 00:21:04.966
- Any customers?
- No, Dr. Venkman.

251
00:21:06.297 --> 00:21:08.001
It's a good job, isn't it?

252
00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:11.042
Type something, will you?
We're paying for this stuff.

253
00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.910
Don't stare at me.
You've got the bug eyes.

254
00:21:16.086 --> 00:21:17.507
Janine.

255
00:21:17.803 --> 00:21:20.631
Sorry about the bug eyes thing.
I'll be in my office.

256
00:21:24.247 --> 00:21:27.002
You're very handy.
I can tell.

257
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.388
- I bet you like to read a lot too.
- Print is dead.

258
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.886
Oh, that's very fascinating to me.
I read a lot myself.

259
00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:41.730
Some people think I'm too intellectual, but I think
it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time.

260
00:21:41.765 --> 00:21:45.406
I also play racquetball.
Do you have any hobbies?

261
00:21:47.428 --> 00:21:49.741
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

262
00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:56.630
Hello?

263
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.684
Oh, excuse me. Is this...
This is the Ghostbusters' office?

264
00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:20.520
Yes, it is.
Can I help you?

265
00:22:20.757 --> 00:22:24.097
I don't have an appointment.
I'd like to talk to someone, please.

266
00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:30.075
I'm Peter Venkman.
May I help you?

267
00:22:30.239 --> 00:22:35.218
Well, I don't know. What I have
to say may sound a little unusual.

268
00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:38.483
Oh, that's all we get, day in,
day out, around this place.

269
00:22:38.592 --> 00:22:41.845
- Come into my office, Miss...
- Oh, Barrett. Dana Barrett.

270
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.716
And this voice said, "Zuul," and then I
slammed the refrigerator door and left.

271
00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:50.067
That was two days ago, and I haven't
been back to my apartment.

272
00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:53.265
Generally, you don't see that kind
of behavior in a major appliance.

273
00:22:53.454 --> 00:22:54.666
What do you think it was?

274
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:57.194
Well, if I knew what it was,
I wouldn't be here.

275
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.103
Egon, what do you think?

276
00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:01.672
She's telling the truth.
At least she thinks she is.

277
00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:07.445
Well, of course I'm telling the truth.
Who would make up a story like that?

278
00:23:07.448 --> 00:23:09.014
Some are people
who just want attention.

279
00:23:09.122 --> 00:23:11.408
Others are just nutballs
who come in off the street.

280
00:23:11.454 --> 00:23:15.775
You know what it could be? Past life
experience intruding on present time.

281
00:23:16.224 --> 00:23:18.512
Could be erased memory stored
in the collective unconscious.

282
00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:21.904
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance
or telepathic contact either.

283
00:23:22.027 --> 00:23:24.779
I'm sorry, I don't believe
in any of those things.

284
00:23:24.782 --> 00:23:29.801
Well, that's all right. I don't either.
But there are some things we do...

285
00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:33.423
...standard procedures in a case
like this, which often bring us results.

286
00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:36.878
Well, I could go to Hall of Records and could
check out the structural details in the building.

287
00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:39.410
Maybe the building itself has
a history of psychic turbulence.

288
00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:40.412
Right.
Good idea.

289
00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:42.941
I could look for the name Zuul
in the usual literature.

290
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.014
Spates Catalog.

291
00:23:44.017 --> 00:23:45.447
- Tobin's Spirit Guide.
- Yeah.

292
00:23:45.552 --> 00:23:48.914
Tell you what. I'll take Miss Barrett back
to her apartment and check her out.

293
00:23:49.737 --> 00:23:53.115
I'll go check out
Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

294
00:23:54.361 --> 00:23:55.650
Okay.

295
00:23:57.113 --> 00:23:59.182
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

296
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:08.971
Please, let me.

297
00:24:09.045 --> 00:24:12.920
If something's gonna happen here,
I want it to happen to me first.

298
00:24:17.684 --> 00:24:19.417
That's the closet.

299
00:24:26.595 --> 00:24:28.170
They hate this.

300
00:24:29.254 --> 00:24:30.964
I like to torture 'em.

301
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:34.323
That's right, boys.
It's Dr. Venkman.

302
00:24:40.578 --> 00:24:42.457
It's a lot of space.

303
00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:46.555
- Just you?
- Yes.

304
00:24:47.187 --> 00:24:48.672
Good.

305
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.588
What is that thing
you're doing?

306
00:24:55.903 --> 00:24:58.866
It's technical.
It's one of our little toys.

307
00:24:59.237 --> 00:25:00.601
I see.

308
00:25:03.026 --> 00:25:06.362
That's the bedroom.
But nothing ever happened in there.

309
00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:12.105
What a crime.

310
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:16.390
You know, you don't act
like a scientist.

311
00:25:16.989 --> 00:25:21.514
- They're usually pretty stiff.
- You're more like a game-show host.

312
00:25:28.534 --> 00:25:30.118
That's the kitchen, huh?

313
00:25:42.922 --> 00:25:45.091
- Dana, are these the eggs?
- Yes.

314
00:25:45.156 --> 00:25:48.253
See, I was over there, and these eggs
just jumped right out of their shells...

315
00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:50.900
- ...and started to cook on the counter.
- That is weird.

316
00:25:50.903 --> 00:25:54.761
And that's when I started to hear that
awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

317
00:25:56.449 --> 00:26:00.278
Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way.
Would you like to check the refrigerator?

318
00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:05.311
Better check the fridge.
Good call.

319
00:26:10.783 --> 00:26:12.980
Oh, my God.

320
00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:15.935
Look at all the junk food.

321
00:26:16.223 --> 00:26:19.241
- No. Goddamn it. This wasn't...
- You actually eat this stuff?

322
00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:21.390
Look, this wasn't here.
There was nothing here.

323
00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:25.135
There was a space and there was a building
or something with flames coming out of it.

324
00:26:25.138 --> 00:26:28.901
And there were creatures writhing around,
and they were growling and snarling.

325
00:26:28.922 --> 00:26:31.831
And there were flames,
and I heard a voice say Zuul.

326
00:26:32.017 --> 00:26:33.338
It was right here.

327
00:26:33.382 --> 00:26:35.300
I'm sorry, I'm just not
getting any reading.

328
00:26:35.303 --> 00:26:37.947
Well, are you sure
you're using that thing correctly?

329
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:42.560
There's no... I think so. But I'm sure
there are no animals in there.

330
00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:44.118
Well, that's great.

331
00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:47.267
Either I have a monster in my kitchen,
or I'm completely crazy.

332
00:26:48.195 --> 00:26:50.283
I don't think you're crazy.

333
00:26:51.063 --> 00:26:53.754
Oh, good. That makes me
feel so much better.

334
00:26:56.467 --> 00:26:57.867
Let me tell you
something about myself.

335
00:26:57.956 --> 00:27:01.299
I come home from work to my place,
and all I have is my work.

336
00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:03.007
- There's nothing else in my life.
- Dr. Venkman.

337
00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:07.403
I meet you, and I say, "My God, there's
someone with the same problem I have."

338
00:27:07.406 --> 00:27:09.969
Yes, we both have
the same problem. You.

339
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.966
I'm gonna go for broke.

340
00:27:19.069 --> 00:27:21.952
- I am madly in love with you.
- I don't believe this.

341
00:27:21.975 --> 00:27:24.296
Will you please leave?

342
00:27:25.034 --> 00:27:28.339
And then she threw me out of her life.
She thought I was a creep.

343
00:27:28.374 --> 00:27:31.313
She thought I was a geek,
and she probably wasn't the first.

344
00:27:31.401 --> 00:27:33.484
You are so odd.

345
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.821
- No.
- I've got it.

346
00:27:39.939 --> 00:27:43.451
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'll prove myself to you.

347
00:27:43.517 --> 00:27:44.822
That's not necessary.

348
00:27:45.123 --> 00:27:48.102
- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem.
- Okay.

349
00:27:48.184 --> 00:27:51.655
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's
a guy who can get things done."

350
00:27:51.658 --> 00:27:52.119
Right.

351
00:27:52.122 --> 00:27:54.095
- "I wonder what makes him tick."
- I wonder.

352
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.754
"I wonder if he'd be interested
in knowing what makes me tick."

353
00:27:56.757 --> 00:27:57.423
Right.

354
00:27:57.426 --> 00:27:59.399
- I'll bet you're gonna be thinking about me...
- Yes.

355
00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:01.731
- ...after I'm gone.
- I bet I am.

356
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.041
No kiss?

357
00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:16.696
To our first customer.

358
00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:19.962
To our first and only customer.

359
00:28:21.611 --> 00:28:22.994
I'm gonna need to
draw some petty cash.

360
00:28:23.342 --> 00:28:25.756
I should take her out to dinner.
We don't want to lose her.

361
00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:31.027
This magnificent feast here
represents the last of the petty cash.

362
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.744
Hey, slow down.
Chew your food.

363
00:28:37.225 --> 00:28:39.439
Hello, Ghostbusters.

364
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.827
Yes, of course they're serious.

365
00:28:44.972 --> 00:28:46.297
You do?

366
00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:48.892
You have?

367
00:28:49.056 --> 00:28:50.633
No kidding.

368
00:28:51.672 --> 00:28:54.861
Well, just... uh...
just give me the address.

369
00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:59.244
Yes, of course.
Oh, they'll be totally discreet.

370
00:29:00.768 --> 00:29:02.404
Thank you.

371
00:29:03.056 --> 00:29:05.718
We got one.

372
00:29:10.118 --> 00:29:11.900
It's a call.

373
00:29:19.134 --> 00:29:20.510
Come on.

374
00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:57.218
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

375
00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:04.844
- Uh... Thank you for coming so quickly.
- Jesus.

376
00:30:05.615 --> 00:30:08.293
The guests are starting to ask questions,
and I'm running out of excuses.

377
00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:09.574
Has it happened before?

378
00:30:09.584 --> 00:30:12.481
Well, most of the original staff
knows about the 12th floor.

379
00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:14.212
- The disturbances, I mean.
- Yeah.

380
00:30:14.307 --> 00:30:17.254
But it's been quiet for years,
up until two weeks ago.

381
00:30:17.289 --> 00:30:19.255
It was never, ever this bad, though.

382
00:30:19.258 --> 00:30:21.852
- Did you ever report it to anyone?
- No. Heavens, no.

383
00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:23.320
- No.
- Oh.

384
00:30:23.323 --> 00:30:25.151
- Carry.
- The owners don't like us to even talk about it.

385
00:30:25.154 --> 00:30:26.249
No.

386
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.615
I hope we could take care
of this quietly.

387
00:30:28.649 --> 00:30:29.721
- It's done.
- Tonight.

388
00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:31.519
Yes, sir.
Don't worry.

389
00:30:31.677 --> 00:30:33.618
We handle this kind of thing
all the time.

390
00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:45.325
What are you supposed to be,
some kind of a cosmonaut?

391
00:30:45.915 --> 00:30:49.413
No, we're exterminators. Somebody
saw a cockroach up on 12th.

392
00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:54.160
- That's gotta be some cockroach.
- Bite your head off, man.

393
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.215
- Going up?
- I'll take the next one.

394
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.289
You know, it just occurred to me we really haven't had
a completely successful test of this equipment.

395
00:31:08.324 --> 00:31:10.554
- I blame myself.
- So do I.

396
00:31:10.643 --> 00:31:13.856
- Well, no sense worrying about it now.
- Why worry?

397
00:31:13.891 --> 00:31:17.706
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed
nuclear accelerator on his back.

398
00:31:18.715 --> 00:31:22.685
Yep. Well, let's get ready.
Switch me on.

399
00:31:59.158 --> 00:32:01.780
What the hell are you doing?

400
00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:05.550
- Sorry.
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

401
00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:07.316
We thought you were someone else.

402
00:32:10.186 --> 00:32:11.931
Successful test.

403
00:32:12.262 --> 00:32:14.212
I guess so.
Uh...

404
00:32:14.746 --> 00:32:17.011
- I think we'd better split up.
- Good idea.

405
00:32:17.046 --> 00:32:19.080
Yeah, we can do
more damage that way.

406
00:32:47.303 --> 00:32:49.713
Venkman?
Venkman.

407
00:32:57.623 --> 00:32:59.828
Disgusting blob.

408
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.501
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

409
00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.545
Come in, Ray.

410
00:33:47.995 --> 00:33:50.772
Venkman.
I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.

411
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.857
It's right here, Ray.
It's looking at me.

412
00:33:54.892 --> 00:33:56.816
<i>He's an ugly little spud,
isn't he?</i>

413
00:33:56.942 --> 00:33:58.545
I think he can hear you, Ray.

414
00:33:58.625 --> 00:34:01.179
Don't move.
It won't hurt you.

415
00:34:08.307 --> 00:34:09.566
Venkman.

416
00:34:11.992 --> 00:34:13.220
Venkman.

417
00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:14.877
Pete.

418
00:34:17.257 --> 00:34:19.413
Venkman, what happened?
Are you okay?

419
00:34:19.448 --> 00:34:20.727
He slimed me.

420
00:34:20.762 --> 00:34:24.323
That's great.
Actual physical contact.

421
00:34:24.358 --> 00:34:26.982
- Can you move?
<i>- Ray, Ray. Come in, please.</i>

422
00:34:26.986 --> 00:34:28.379
I feel so funky.

423
00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:30.590
Spengler.
I'm with Venkman.

424
00:34:31.218 --> 00:34:32.798
He got slimed.

425
00:34:32.833 --> 00:34:34.843
<i>That's great, Ray.
Save some for me.</i>

426
00:34:35.183 --> 00:34:37.344
<i>Get down here, right away.
It just went into a ballroom.</i>

427
00:34:37.858 --> 00:34:38.945
Okay, we'll be right there.

428
00:34:42.007 --> 00:34:44.693
Okay, sir, if you and your staff
could please wait out here...

429
00:34:44.723 --> 00:34:46.470
...we'll take care of everything.

430
00:35:05.653 --> 00:35:07.443
There it is.
On the ceiling.

431
00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:12.257
That's the one that got me.

432
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:21.886
All right, boys.

433
00:35:21.908 --> 00:35:23.246
Ready?

434
00:35:23.833 --> 00:35:25.098
Throw it.

435
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.085
I did that.
I did that.

436
00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:39.130
- That's my fault.
- It's okay. The table broke the fall.

437
00:35:39.546 --> 00:35:41.838
There's something very important
I forgot to tell you.

438
00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:44.733
- What?
- Don't cross the streams.

439
00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:47.549
- Why?
- It would be bad.

440
00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:51.289
I'm fuzzy on the whole good bad thing.
What do you mean, bad?

441
00:35:51.324 --> 00:35:54.437
Try to imagine all life as you
know it stopping instantaneously...

442
00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:57.881
...and every molecule in your body
exploding at the speed of light.

443
00:35:58.257 --> 00:35:59.811
Total protonic reversal.

444
00:35:59.846 --> 00:36:03.965
Right, that's bad. Okay,
important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

445
00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:07.902
All right, Ray, take the left.
Egon, take the right.

446
00:36:15.221 --> 00:36:17.678
Okay, Ray, just give me
one high and outside.

447
00:36:17.887 --> 00:36:19.082
Ray.

448
00:36:22.173 --> 00:36:23.622
Egon.

449
00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:34.058
Okay, all right.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

450
00:36:36.933 --> 00:36:38.429
Nice shooting, Tex.

451
00:36:38.489 --> 00:36:41.023
I assure you, Mrs. Van Houten,
there is no problem with the room.

452
00:36:41.026 --> 00:36:43.386
It'll be ready promptly on time
as soon as your guests are with us.

453
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:45.497
The last throw took something
out of him, but he's gonna move.

454
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.301
I need some... I need some room to
put the trap down. Give me some room.

455
00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:51.297
You'll excuse me, please.

456
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:01.278
- Gotta get this in the clear.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

457
00:37:01.549 --> 00:37:03.558
I've always wanted to do this.

458
00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:05.853
And...

459
00:37:05.888 --> 00:37:08.963
- The flowers are still standing.
- Okay, on my go-signal.

460
00:37:09.098 --> 00:37:12.694
Spengler, I want a confinement stream
from you, okay? Go.

461
00:37:13.037 --> 00:37:15.338
Okay, hold him up there.
He's gonna move. Hold him up.

462
00:37:15.632 --> 00:37:16.912
Go.

463
00:37:18.413 --> 00:37:19.581
It's working, Ray.

464
00:37:19.584 --> 00:37:21.042
Start bringing him down.
Start bringing him down.

465
00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.443
You got him.
Don't cross the stream.

466
00:37:22.478 --> 00:37:26.183
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy
with a positron collider, huh?

467
00:37:26.848 --> 00:37:29.443
Venkman, shorten your stream.
I don't want my face burned off.

468
00:37:30.388 --> 00:37:33.216
All right, I'm opening the trap now.
Don't look directly into the trap.

469
00:37:34.653 --> 00:37:36.295
I looked at the trap, Ray.

470
00:37:36.377 --> 00:37:38.517
Turn your streams off
as soon as I close the trap.

471
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.869
Get ready. I'm closing it.

472
00:37:41.156 --> 00:37:42.429
Now.

473
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:02.837
It's in there.

474
00:38:06.195 --> 00:38:08.644
Well, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

475
00:38:11.246 --> 00:38:13.371
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now.

476
00:38:13.617 --> 00:38:15.188
Donald, stand over there.

477
00:38:16.164 --> 00:38:18.547
We came, we saw,
we kicked its ass.

478
00:38:18.591 --> 00:38:19.901
Did you see it?
What is it?

479
00:38:19.904 --> 00:38:21.129
We got it.

480
00:38:21.911 --> 00:38:23.814
What is it?
Will there be any more of them?

481
00:38:24.127 --> 00:38:27.269
Sir, what you had there
was what we refer to as a focused...

482
00:38:27.272 --> 00:38:31.224
...non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

483
00:38:31.259 --> 00:38:32.976
Real nasty one too.

484
00:38:33.172 --> 00:38:34.695
And now...

485
00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:36.290
...let's talk seriously.

486
00:38:36.357 --> 00:38:41.165
Now, for the entrapment, we're gonna have
to ask you for four big ones, $4000 for that.

487
00:38:41.168 --> 00:38:45.838
But we are having a special this week
on proton charging and storage of the beast.

488
00:38:46.129 --> 00:38:48.527
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

489
00:38:48.562 --> 00:38:52.379
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea
it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

490
00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:54.447
Well, that's all right.
We can just put it right back in there.

491
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.287
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

492
00:38:56.344 --> 00:39:00.447
No, no. All right.
Anything.

493
00:39:00.603 --> 00:39:01.864
Thanks so much.

494
00:39:02.012 --> 00:39:03.751
Thank you.
Hope we can help you again.

495
00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:06.554
Coming through. One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

496
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:10.068
<i>Good morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...</i>

497
00:39:10.071 --> 00:39:13.321
<i>...is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.</i>

498
00:39:13.447 --> 00:39:19.141
<i>Alleged ghost-sightings and supernatural occurrences
have been reported across the entire tri-state area.</i>

499
00:39:19.285 --> 00:39:22.052
<i>Well, everybody has heard
ghost stories around the campfire.</i>

500
00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:24.989
Heck, my grandma used to spin yarns
about a spectral locomotive...

501
00:39:25.156 --> 00:39:27.867
...that would rocket past the farm
where she grew up.

502
00:39:27.902 --> 00:39:30.871
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority...

503
00:39:50.612 --> 00:39:51.640
Stand aside, please.

504
00:39:51.712 --> 00:39:55.454
<i>Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic today, ghosts and ghostbusting.</i>

505
00:39:55.489 --> 00:39:58.113
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

506
00:39:58.181 --> 00:40:03.667
Some maintain that these professional paranormal
eliminators in New York are the cause of it all.

507
00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:11.281
I got it.
I got it.

508
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:13.595
Pete. Ray.

509
00:40:22.488 --> 00:40:26.536
<i>Still making headlines all across the country,
the Ghostbusters are at it again.</i>

510
00:40:26.616 --> 00:40:29.255
<i>This time at the fashionable
dance club, The Rose.</i>

511
00:40:29.373 --> 00:40:32.504
<i>The boys in gray slugged it out
with a pretty pesky poltergeist...</i>

512
00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:36.443
<i>...then stayed on to dance the night away with some
of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance.</i>

513
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:39.521
<i>This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.</i>

514
00:40:39.522 --> 00:40:41.813
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

515
00:40:41.931 --> 00:40:44.706
No job is too big,
no fee is too big.

516
00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:48.589
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and legs?

517
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:52.729
<i>As they say in TV, I'm sure there's
one big question on everybody's mind...</i>

518
00:40:52.732 --> 00:40:54.662
<i>...and I imagine you are
the man to answer that.</i>

519
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.553
<i>How is Elvis,
and have you seen him lately?</i>

520
00:41:42.334 --> 00:41:44.955
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections...

521
00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:47.728
...mental telepathy, ESP,
clairvoyance...

522
00:41:47.731 --> 00:41:50.467
...spirit photography,
telekinetic movement...

523
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:55.431
...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

524
00:41:55.555 --> 00:41:59.980
Uh, if there's a steady paycheck in it,
I'll believe anything you say.

525
00:42:01.115 --> 00:42:03.139
I gotta get some sleep.
I'm dying.

526
00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:05.717
You don't look good.

527
00:42:05.891 --> 00:42:07.664
- I don't?
- Well, you've looked better.

528
00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:09.403
You didn't used to look like this.

529
00:42:09.808 --> 00:42:11.355
Can you hold, please?

530
00:42:11.895 --> 00:42:14.504
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn.
She paid with Visa.

531
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.516
Here's tonight's worksheet.

532
00:42:16.602 --> 00:42:18.470
Oh, great.
Two more free repeaters.

533
00:42:18.763 --> 00:42:21.794
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

534
00:42:21.889 --> 00:42:24.749
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

535
00:42:25.004 --> 00:42:26.983
- Congratulations.
- Can you help me, please?

536
00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:33.572
Welcome aboard.

537
00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:37.032
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

538
00:42:37.067 --> 00:42:40.016
I mean someone should tell him it's not gonna
do much good to scream at us in German.

539
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.880
Well, I don't think that the man is competent
to conduct a major symphony orchestra.

540
00:42:46.209 --> 00:42:50.163
- Could you wait here a minute?
- Huh? Uh... Sure.

541
00:42:56.682 --> 00:42:59.101
Dr. Venkman.
This is a surprise.

542
00:42:59.136 --> 00:43:01.339
- That was a wonderful rehearsal.
- You heard that?

543
00:43:01.515 --> 00:43:03.551
Yes, you're the best
one in your row.

544
00:43:03.586 --> 00:43:04.933
Oh, thank you.

545
00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:08.386
You're good. Most people can't hear
me with the whole orchestra playing.

546
00:43:08.389 --> 00:43:10.497
Ah, I don't have to take
this abuse from you.

547
00:43:10.657 --> 00:43:12.858
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

548
00:43:13.162 --> 00:43:15.241
I know.
You're a big celebrity now.

549
00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:17.821
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

550
00:43:22.953 --> 00:43:24.565
Who's the stiff?

551
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.541
The stiff happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the world.

552
00:43:28.576 --> 00:43:30.567
Do you have some information
for me, please?

553
00:43:30.581 --> 00:43:32.778
Well, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

554
00:43:33.036 --> 00:43:36.502
- Why don't you tell me now?
- Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

555
00:43:36.746 --> 00:43:42.315
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod
worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the...

556
00:43:42.543 --> 00:43:44.165
What's that word?

557
00:43:44.867 --> 00:43:46.600
- Hittites.
- Hittites...

558
00:43:46.637 --> 00:43:48.725
...Mesopotamians
and Sumerians.

559
00:43:50.619 --> 00:43:52.976
Zuul was the minion of Gozer.

560
00:43:53.229 --> 00:43:54.739
What's Gozer?

561
00:43:55.557 --> 00:43:59.437
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria. Big guy.
- Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

562
00:44:00.041 --> 00:44:03.041
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night...

563
00:44:03.049 --> 00:44:06.545
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

564
00:44:06.631 --> 00:44:10.027
I can't see you Thursday.
I'm... I'm... I'm busy.

565
00:44:10.058 --> 00:44:14.426
Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is
something wrong up here that says in your mind:..

566
00:44:14.461 --> 00:44:17.888
..."He enjoys taking his evenings off
and spending it with his clients."

567
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:20.862
No, I'm making a special exception
in your case...

568
00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:22.555
...because...

569
00:44:23.092 --> 00:44:24.302
...I respect you.

570
00:44:24.387 --> 00:44:26.540
It's corny, but I respect you
as an artist.

571
00:44:26.811 --> 00:44:27.718
And as a dresser too.

572
00:44:27.721 --> 00:44:30.613
- This is a magnificent coordination you have going here today.
- Oh, okay. Oh...

573
00:44:31.096 --> 00:44:32.133
I'll see you Thursday.

574
00:44:32.136 --> 00:44:34.734
I'll bring the Roylance Guide,
and we'll eat and read.

575
00:44:42.305 --> 00:44:44.665
- So who the hell is that?
- He's just a friend.

576
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.211
- A friend?
- An old friend.

577
00:44:46.346 --> 00:44:48.011
Bye.
Well, I'll see you Thursday.

578
00:44:48.256 --> 00:44:51.930
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

579
00:44:52.099 --> 00:44:55.120
You're still very pale, though.
A little sun.

580
00:44:55.174 --> 00:44:57.758
- Well, what does he do?
- He's a... scientist.

581
00:45:09.145 --> 00:45:13.324
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

582
00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:18.286
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system...

583
00:45:19.113 --> 00:45:20.691
...insert the trap...

584
00:45:22.237 --> 00:45:23.974
...release...

585
00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:28.515
...close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

586
00:45:28.961 --> 00:45:30.723
Neutronize your field.

587
00:45:30.758 --> 00:45:31.698
And...

588
00:45:32.676 --> 00:45:35.080
...the light is green,
the trap is clean.

589
00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:38.507
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom-made storage facility.

590
00:45:38.727 --> 00:45:42.154
There's a man from the EPA here
to see you. He's waiting in your office.

591
00:45:42.311 --> 00:45:44.923
- EPA? What's he want?
- I don't know.

592
00:45:45.197 --> 00:45:48.237
All I do know is I've been working
two weeks without a break...

593
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.831
...and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

594
00:45:51.206 --> 00:45:53.471
Janine, someone
with your qualifications...

595
00:45:53.681 --> 00:45:56.495
...would have no trouble finding
a topflight job...

596
00:45:56.557 --> 00:46:00.321
...in either the food service or
housekeeping industries.

597
00:46:01.304 --> 00:46:04.657
- Are you gonna answer that?
- I've quit better jobs than this.

598
00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:07.956
Ghostbusters.
What do you want?

599
00:46:07.991 --> 00:46:10.773
- Can I help you?
- I'm Walter Peck.

600
00:46:10.948 --> 00:46:14.814
I represent the Environmental
Protection Agency, the third district.

601
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.652
Great.
How's it going down there?

602
00:46:19.601 --> 00:46:21.356
Are you Peter Venkman?

603
00:46:22.477 --> 00:46:23.635
Yes, I'm...

604
00:46:24.445 --> 00:46:25.642
...Dr. Venkman.

605
00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:28.623
Exactly what are you a doctor of,
Mr. Venkman?

606
00:46:28.704 --> 00:46:32.176
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology
and psychology.

607
00:46:32.948 --> 00:46:34.690
I see.

608
00:46:34.943 --> 00:46:37.657
And now you catch ghosts.

609
00:46:37.991 --> 00:46:39.438
<i>Yeah, you could say that.</i>

610
00:46:40.403 --> 00:46:42.779
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

611
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:47.310
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- And where do you put these ghosts...

612
00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:48.865
...once you catch them?

613
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.752
Into a storage facility.

614
00:46:51.908 --> 00:46:54.993
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

615
00:46:55.194 --> 00:46:59.631
- Yes.
- And may I see this storage facility?

616
00:46:59.957 --> 00:47:03.164
- No.
- And why not, Mr. Venkman?

617
00:47:04.906 --> 00:47:07.351
Because you did not use
the magic word.

618
00:47:10.423 --> 00:47:14.096
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

619
00:47:15.574 --> 00:47:17.227
Please.

620
00:47:18.133 --> 00:47:21.836
May I please see the storage facility,
Mr. Venkman?

621
00:47:22.064 --> 00:47:25.589
- Why do you want to see the storage facility?
- Well, because I'm curious.

622
00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:28.748
I want to know more about
what you do here.

623
00:47:29.183 --> 00:47:31.906
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media...

624
00:47:31.914 --> 00:47:36.169
...and we want to assess any possible
environmental impact from your operation.

625
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:41.702
For instance, the presence of noxious, possibly
hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.

626
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:46.459
Now, you either show me what is down there,
or I come back with a court order.

627
00:47:47.206 --> 00:47:51.594
You go get a court order, and I'll sue
your ass for wrongful prosecution.

628
00:47:51.988 --> 00:47:54.735
You can have it your way,
Mr. Venkman.

629
00:47:55.415 --> 00:48:00.083
I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there, and all
my recent data points to something big on the horizon.

630
00:48:00.993 --> 00:48:02.510
What do you mean big?

631
00:48:03.614 --> 00:48:10.439
Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal
amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area.

632
00:48:10.914 --> 00:48:14.046
According to this morning's sample,
it would be a Twinkie...

633
00:48:14.788 --> 00:48:18.498
...35 feet long, weighing
approximately 600 pounds.

634
00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:21.036
That's a big Twinkie.

635
00:48:21.674 --> 00:48:23.735
We could be on the verge
of a fourfold cross rip...

636
00:48:23.792 --> 00:48:27.239
...a PKE surge of incredible,
even dangerous, proportions.

637
00:48:28.139 --> 00:48:31.275
We just had a visit from the
Environmental Protection Agency.

638
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:34.019
- How's the grid holding up?
- Not good.

639
00:48:34.054 --> 00:48:35.858
Tell him about the Twinkie.

640
00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:38.438
What about the Twinkie?

641
00:49:33.733 --> 00:49:36.131
- Oh, Dana, it's you.
- Hello, Louis.

642
00:49:36.166 --> 00:49:38.877
You gotta come in here.
You're missing a classic party.

643
00:49:39.071 --> 00:49:42.634
Yes, well, I would, Louis,
but I have a date coming.

644
00:49:46.575 --> 00:49:48.135
You made a date...

645
00:49:48.433 --> 00:49:53.240
- ...tonight?
- Well, I... I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

646
00:49:55.629 --> 00:49:58.767
Oh, that's okay.
You can bring him along.

647
00:49:59.751 --> 00:50:02.707
All right.
Maybe we'll stop by, okay?

648
00:50:03.422 --> 00:50:05.170
That's great.
I'll tell everybody you're coming.

649
00:50:05.195 --> 00:50:08.043
We're gonna play Twister,
we're gonna do some break dancing...

650
00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:09.516
Hey, ev...

651
00:50:10.405 --> 00:50:14.801
<i>Hey, let me in. It's Louis.
Somebody let me in.</i>

652
00:50:39.675 --> 00:50:41.042
Hello?

653
00:50:41.106 --> 00:50:43.147
Oh, hi, Mom.
Um...

654
00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:45.344
I've been busy.

655
00:50:45.509 --> 00:50:47.961
Well, uh...
No, everything is fine.

656
00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:51.284
Yeah. No, just that, um...
that one time.

657
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.039
Oh, I am.

658
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:55.969
I will.

659
00:50:57.605 --> 00:51:01.303
I won't. Mom, um... I have to go.
I have a date.

660
00:51:02.452 --> 00:51:05.881
Yes. No, no one you know.
It's... uh...

661
00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:10.054
Well, he's a...
he's a Ghostbuster.

662
00:51:10.932 --> 00:51:12.904
Those guys on TV.

663
00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:15.972
Yes, well, I'll have
to let you know.

664
00:51:16.137 --> 00:51:18.379
Okay.
Love to Dad.

665
00:51:18.664 --> 00:51:21.187
Right. Bye. Bye.

666
00:51:42.529 --> 00:51:44.036
Oh, shit.

667
00:52:16.206 --> 00:52:19.410
Do you have any Excedrin
or Extra Strength Tylenol?

668
00:52:19.586 --> 00:52:22.908
Gee, I think all I got is
acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

669
00:52:22.912 --> 00:52:26.897
See, I can get 600 tablets of that for the
same price as 300 of the name brand.

670
00:52:27.005 --> 00:52:29.316
That makes good financial sense.
Good advice.

671
00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:31.917
Hey, this is real smoked salmon
from Nova Scotia, Canada...

672
00:52:31.983 --> 00:52:33.553
...24.95 a pound.

673
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:36.032
It only cost me 14.12
after tax, though.

674
00:52:36.067 --> 00:52:37.956
I'm giving this whole thing as
a promotional expense.

675
00:52:38.093 --> 00:52:41.789
That's why I invited clients instead
of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

676
00:52:42.027 --> 00:52:44.679
How you doing? Why don't you have some
of the Brie? It's at room temperature.

677
00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:46.796
You think it's too warm
in here for the Brie?

678
00:52:46.863 --> 00:52:49.065
Louis, I'm going home.

679
00:52:49.211 --> 00:52:50.319
Don't leave yet.

680
00:52:50.322 --> 00:52:53.629
And listen, maybe if we start
dancing, other people will join in.

681
00:52:54.151 --> 00:52:55.597
Okay.

682
00:52:58.697 --> 00:53:00.998
Oh, don't move.
I just gotta get the door.

683
00:53:03.155 --> 00:53:04.858
- Ted. Annette.
- Hi.

684
00:53:04.861 --> 00:53:07.462
I'm glad you could come.
How you doing? Give me your coats.

685
00:53:07.497 --> 00:53:10.056
Everybody, this is Ted
and Annette Fleming.

686
00:53:10.124 --> 00:53:11.431
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

687
00:53:11.519 --> 00:53:14.616
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning
business in receivership.

688
00:53:14.676 --> 00:53:17.998
Annette's drawing a salary from
a deferred bonus from two years ago.

689
00:53:18.037 --> 00:53:21.249
They got 15,000 left
on the house at 8 percent.

690
00:53:22.311 --> 00:53:23.935
So they're okay.

691
00:53:24.327 --> 00:53:25.325
So...

692
00:53:25.352 --> 00:53:27.711
...does anybody want
to play Parcheesi?

693
00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:32.154
Okay, who brought the dog?

694
00:53:53.648 --> 00:53:57.375
Help. There's a bear loose
in my apartment. Help. Help.

695
00:54:01.362 --> 00:54:02.549
Help.

696
00:54:02.616 --> 00:54:05.050
- What?
- A bear in his apartment.

697
00:54:10.276 --> 00:54:12.375
I'm gonna bring this up
at the next tenants' meeting.

698
00:54:12.428 --> 00:54:14.950
There's not supposed to be
any pets in the building.

699
00:54:30.939 --> 00:54:32.174
Let me in.

700
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.922
There's gotta be a way
in here. I gotta get...

701
00:54:38.969 --> 00:54:42.018
Somebody, let me in.

702
00:54:48.196 --> 00:54:49.559
Nice doggy.

703
00:54:49.639 --> 00:54:51.395
Cute little pooch.

704
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:54.062
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

705
00:55:14.303 --> 00:55:15.339
Hey, what happened?

706
00:55:15.342 --> 00:55:18.403
Some moron brought a cougar
to a party, and it went berserk.

707
00:55:21.312 --> 00:55:24.185
Hi, I'm going up to
Dana Barrett's. Okay?

708
00:55:43.869 --> 00:55:45.320
Hello.

709
00:55:48.374 --> 00:55:50.557
That's a different look for you,
isn't it?

710
00:55:51.069 --> 00:55:53.230
Are you the Keymaster?

711
00:55:54.889 --> 00:55:56.632
Not that I know of.

712
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:11.092
Are you the Keymaster?

713
00:56:11.272 --> 00:56:12.883
Yes.

714
00:56:12.886 --> 00:56:15.365
I'm a friend of his.
He told me to meet him here.

715
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.086
- I didn't get your name.
- I am Zuul.

716
00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.057
I am the Gatekeeper.

717
00:56:27.204 --> 00:56:31.694
- What are we doing today, Zuul?
- Must prepare for the coming of Gozer.

718
00:56:32.787 --> 00:56:34.399
Gozer, huh?

719
00:56:35.464 --> 00:56:37.564
The Destructor.

720
00:56:45.442 --> 00:56:47.012
Are we still going out?

721
00:56:49.846 --> 00:56:52.666
You know, you could pick up the place
if you're expecting someone.

722
00:56:54.095 --> 00:56:56.668
Do you want this body?

723
00:56:57.666 --> 00:56:59.430
Is this a trick question?

724
00:57:02.672 --> 00:57:04.954
I guess the roses worked, huh?

725
00:57:05.203 --> 00:57:07.035
Take me now...

726
00:57:07.426 --> 00:57:08.914
...sub-creature.

727
00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:10.680
We never talk anymore.

728
00:57:11.784 --> 00:57:16.503
Easy. I make it a rule never to get
involved with possessed people.

729
00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:21.247
Actually, it's more of
a guideline than a rule.

730
00:57:21.328 --> 00:57:22.573
You know, I can...

731
00:57:22.821 --> 00:57:24.977
I want you inside me.

732
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.387
Go ahead.
No, I can't.

733
00:57:28.472 --> 00:57:30.824
Sounds like you got at least
two people in there already.

734
00:57:31.365 --> 00:57:32.919
Might be a little crowded.

735
00:57:33.249 --> 00:57:35.629
Come on, I... I... why don't you
just quit trying to...

736
00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:38.677
...upset and disturb Dr. Venkman
and just relax?

737
00:57:38.706 --> 00:57:42.444
Lie down there. Relax.
Put your hands on your chest.

738
00:57:42.723 --> 00:57:45.255
What I'd really like to do
is talk to Dana.

739
00:57:45.421 --> 00:57:47.057
I want to talk to Dana.

740
00:57:47.777 --> 00:57:49.183
Dana, it's Peter.

741
00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:52.996
There is no Dana.
There is only Zuul.

742
00:57:53.097 --> 00:57:55.549
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on.

743
00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.089
Come on, I want to talk
to Dana. Dana.

744
00:57:58.124 --> 00:58:00.453
Just relax.
Come on. Dana.

745
00:58:00.545 --> 00:58:02.499
Dana.
Can I talk to Dana?

746
00:58:03.001 --> 00:58:06.717
There is no Dana,
only Zuul.

747
00:58:06.935 --> 00:58:09.444
What a lovely singing voice
you must have.

748
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:11.239
Now, I'm gonna count
to three, Zuulie.

749
00:58:11.722 --> 00:58:13.493
And if I don't get
to talk to Dana...

750
00:58:14.152 --> 00:58:16.870
...there's gonna be some real trouble
in this apartment, I think.

751
00:58:17.428 --> 00:58:18.817
One...

752
00:58:21.223 --> 00:58:22.657
...two...

753
00:58:24.174 --> 00:58:25.673
...two and a half...

754
00:59:09.893 --> 00:59:11.603
Please come down.

755
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:15.049
I am the Keymaster.

756
00:59:15.957 --> 00:59:17.852
The Destructor is coming.

757
00:59:19.092 --> 00:59:21.165
The Traveler.
The Destroyer.

758
00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:29.658
Gatekeeper.

759
00:59:35.634 --> 00:59:36.804
I am Vinz.

760
00:59:37.047 --> 00:59:39.386
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

761
00:59:39.636 --> 00:59:43.009
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the
Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

762
00:59:43.343 --> 00:59:46.471
Hey, he pulls the wagon, I make
the deals. You want a ride?

763
00:59:55.595 --> 00:59:58.495
Wait for the sign.
Then all prisoners will be released.

764
00:59:59.357 --> 01:00:02.932
You will perish in flame,
you and all your kind. Gatekeeper.

765
01:00:03.341 --> 01:00:04.887
What an asshole.

766
01:00:11.035 --> 01:00:13.795
- Dropping off or picking up?
- Dropping off.

767
01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:15.748
Just a moment.

768
01:00:19.554 --> 01:00:21.182
- You a Ghostbuster?
- Yes.

769
01:00:21.655 --> 01:00:23.786
We picked up this guy. Now we
don't know what to do with him.

770
01:00:23.861 --> 01:00:26.204
Bellevue doesn't want him,
and I'm afraid to put him in the lock up.

771
01:00:26.207 --> 01:00:29.350
And I know you guys are into this stuff,
so I figured we'd check with you.

772
01:00:29.385 --> 01:00:30.635
All right.

773
01:00:34.169 --> 01:00:35.954
Are you the Gatekeeper?

774
01:00:39.365 --> 01:00:41.103
You better bring him inside.

775
01:00:42.761 --> 01:00:45.343
You are so kind to take
care of that man.

776
01:00:45.378 --> 01:00:47.489
You know, you are
a real humanitarian.

777
01:00:47.524 --> 01:00:49.389
I don't think he's human.

778
01:00:58.019 --> 01:00:59.746
What did you say your name was?

779
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:02.778
Vinz Clortho,
Keymaster of Gozer.

780
01:01:02.813 --> 01:01:05.088
According to this,
his name's Louis Tully.

781
01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:07.139
Lives on Central Park West.

782
01:01:09.284 --> 01:01:11.903
Do you want some coffee,
Mr. Tully?

783
01:01:12.129 --> 01:01:14.013
- Do I?
- Yes, have some.

784
01:01:14.048 --> 01:01:15.603
Yes, have some.

785
01:01:17.782 --> 01:01:20.939
Vinz, you said before you
were waiting for a sign.

786
01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:23.763
- What sign are you waiting for?
- Gozer the Traveler.

787
01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:26.135
He will come in one
of the pre-chosen forms.

788
01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:30.971
During the rectification of the Vuldronaii,
the Traveler came as a large moving Torb.

789
01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:34.698
Then, during the third reconciliation
of the last of the Meketrex supplicants...

790
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:38.117
...they chose a new form for him,
that of a giant Sloar.

791
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:43.182
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted
in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you.

792
01:01:43.451 --> 01:01:46.329
- Egon.
- Excuse me.

793
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.570
There's something very strange
about that man.

794
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:59.605
Listen, I'm usually very psychic, and I have a terrible
feeling that something awful is gonna happen to you.

795
01:02:01.294 --> 01:02:03.279
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

796
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:07.062
I'll get it.

797
01:02:10.199 --> 01:02:12.506
- Hello?
<i>- Egon, it's Peter.</i>

798
01:02:12.509 --> 01:02:15.756
- Thanks, I've got it.
<i>- I have some news from the world of Gozer.</i>

799
01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:18.791
<i>- What is it, Peter?
- I'm here with Dana Barrett.</i>

800
01:02:19.313 --> 01:02:24.013
<i>It seems the Goz has been putting
some moves on my would-be girlfriend.</i>

801
01:02:24.295 --> 01:02:25.267
<i>How is she?</i>

802
01:02:25.419 --> 01:02:28.380
<i>I think we can get her
a guest-shot on Wild Kingdom.</i>

803
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.791
<i>I just whacked her up
with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.</i>

804
01:02:32.126 --> 01:02:36.451
She's gonna take a little nap now, but...
uh... she says she's the Gatekeeper.

805
01:02:36.573 --> 01:02:38.673
- Does that make any sense to you?
<i>- Some.</i>

806
01:02:38.716 --> 01:02:41.965
I just met the Keymaster.
He's here with me now.

807
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.713
Wonderful. We have
to get these two together.

808
01:02:47.117 --> 01:02:49.601
I think that would be
extraordinarily dangerous.

809
01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:52.831
Okay, well, hold onto him.
I'll be there in a little while.

810
01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:54.206
Good.

811
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:59.684
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray.
I need him here immediately.

812
01:03:05.011 --> 01:03:08.032
Bad news, honey,
I gotta go to work.

813
01:03:08.586 --> 01:03:10.907
Hey, will you stay here in bed
until I get back?

814
01:03:21.639 --> 01:03:25.573
<i>- Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?
- Never met him.</i>

815
01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:29.946
Yeah, well, I do. And I love
Jesus' style, you know?

816
01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:33.575
This roof cap is made of
a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

817
01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:36.295
What are you so involved
with there?

818
01:03:37.009 --> 01:03:40.526
These are blueprints for the structural ironwork
in Dana Barrett's apartment building...

819
01:03:40.531 --> 01:03:43.169
...and they're very, very strange.

820
01:03:43.413 --> 01:03:51.238
Hey, Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about
the last days when the dead would rise from the grave?

821
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:53.973
I remember Revelations 7:12.

822
01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:59.075
And I looked as he opened the sixth seal.
And behold, there was a great earthquake.

823
01:03:59.247 --> 01:04:01.904
And the sun became
as black as sackcloth.

824
01:04:01.994 --> 01:04:03.638
And the moon became as blood.

825
01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.942
And the seas boiled.
And the skies fell.

826
01:04:08.506 --> 01:04:10.744
- Judgment day.
- Judgment day.

827
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.392
Every ancient religion has its own
myth about the end of the world.

828
01:04:14.405 --> 01:04:15.843
Myth?

829
01:04:16.603 --> 01:04:18.516
Ray, has it ever occurred to you...

830
01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:24.340
...that maybe the reason we've been so busy lately is
because the dead have been rising from the grave?

831
01:04:29.163 --> 01:04:32.747
- How about a little music?
- Yeah.

832
01:05:12.318 --> 01:05:13.819
This way.

833
01:05:22.579 --> 01:05:24.044
Excuse me.

834
01:05:24.857 --> 01:05:27.237
Excuse me. Just where
do you think you're going?

835
01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.136
Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested
for interfering with the police...

836
01:05:30.303 --> 01:05:32.246
Oh, no. Hold on.
I've seen TV.

837
01:05:32.249 --> 01:05:34.880
I know you can't come in here without
a warrant or a writ or something.

838
01:05:34.926 --> 01:05:38.101
Cease and Desist All Commerce order,
Seizure of Premises and Chattels...

839
01:05:38.165 --> 01:05:41.098
...ban on the use of Public Utilities
for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers...

840
01:05:41.133 --> 01:05:43.447
...and a federal
Entry and Inspection order.

841
01:05:44.609 --> 01:05:46.918
Vinz, there's one more test
I'd like to perform.

842
01:05:46.921 --> 01:05:51.565
Egon. I tried to stop them.
He says they have a warrant.

843
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:55.528
- Excuse me, this is private property.
- Shut this off. Shut these all off.

844
01:05:55.709 --> 01:05:58.678
I'm warning you. Turning off these
machines would be extremely hazardous.

845
01:05:58.713 --> 01:06:03.626
I'll tell you what's hazardous. You're facing federal prosecution
for at least a half a dozen environmental violations.

846
01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:06.260
Now, either you shut off these beams,
or we shut them off for you.

847
01:06:10.635 --> 01:06:13.783
Try to understand, this is a high-voltage
laser containment system.

848
01:06:13.818 --> 01:06:16.515
Simply turning it off would be
like dropping a bomb in the city.

849
01:06:16.557 --> 01:06:20.094
Don't patronize me. I'm not grotesquely
stupid, like the people you bilk.

850
01:06:20.258 --> 01:06:22.059
At ease, officer.
I'm Peter Venkman.

851
01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:25.833
I think there's just been a misunderstanding,
and I want to cooperate in any way that I can.

852
01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:27.317
Forget it, Venkman.

853
01:06:27.463 --> 01:06:30.669
You had your chance to cooperate, but
you thought it'd be more fun to insult me.

854
01:06:30.824 --> 01:06:32.370
Well, now it is my turn,
wise-ass.

855
01:06:32.443 --> 01:06:34.582
He wants to shut down
the protection grid, Peter.

856
01:06:34.701 --> 01:06:37.444
You shut that thing down,
we are not gonna be held responsible...

857
01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:38.770
- ...whatever happens.
- You'll be responsible.

858
01:06:38.773 --> 01:06:41.110
- No, we won't be held responsible.
- Shut it off.

859
01:06:41.584 --> 01:06:44.721
Don't shut it off.
I'm warning you.

860
01:06:45.751 --> 01:06:48.166
I've never seen anything like this before.
I don't know...

861
01:06:48.169 --> 01:06:51.399
Hey, I'm not interested in
your opinion. Just shut it off.

862
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:55.380
My friend, don't be a jerk.

863
01:06:55.384 --> 01:06:58.055
- Step aside.
- If he does that again, you can shoot him.

864
01:06:58.057 --> 01:07:00.592
You do your job, pencil-neck.
Don't tell me how to do mine.

865
01:07:00.595 --> 01:07:02.534
- Thank you, officer.
- Shut it off.

866
01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.882
Oh, shit.

867
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:44.386
Clear the building.

868
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:17.147
This is it.
This is the sign.

869
01:08:17.346 --> 01:08:21.181
Yeah, it's a sign, all right.
We're going out of business.

870
01:08:31.195 --> 01:08:33.310
- Hey, aim up there.
- Hey, officer. What's going on?

871
01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.763
- What happened?
- Storage facility blew.

872
01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:38.508
- He shut off the protection grid.
- Oh, great.

873
01:08:38.513 --> 01:08:40.344
- That's bad, isn't it?
- Yeah.

874
01:08:40.544 --> 01:08:43.083
- Where's the Keymaster?
- Shit.

875
01:08:43.218 --> 01:08:44.982
- Who's the Keymaster?
- Oh, come on.

876
01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:48.502
Hold it.
I want this man arrested.

877
01:08:48.608 --> 01:08:52.269
Captain, these men are in criminal violation
of the Environmental Protection Act.

878
01:08:52.458 --> 01:08:54.982
- And this explosion is a direct result of it.
- Your mother...

879
01:08:55.278 --> 01:08:57.428
Come on, hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

880
01:09:41.998 --> 01:09:46.726
Columbia Building, 57th Street.
I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

881
01:10:42.198 --> 01:10:43.557
Hey, guard.

882
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.576
I want to make a phone call.

883
01:10:46.634 --> 01:10:49.286
Yeah, I just work with these guys.
I mean I wasn't even there.

884
01:10:49.534 --> 01:10:53.063
The structure of this roof cap is exactly
like the kind of telemetry tracker...

885
01:10:53.076 --> 01:10:56.466
...that NASA uses to identify
dead pulsars in deep space.

886
01:10:57.219 --> 01:11:02.525
Cold-riveted girders
with cores of pure selenium.

887
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:05.091
Everybody getting this so far?

888
01:11:05.827 --> 01:11:09.012
So what? I guess they just don't
make them like they used to, huh?

889
01:11:09.142 --> 01:11:11.310
No. Nobody ever made
them like this.

890
01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:15.777
I mean the architect was either a certified
genius or an authentic wacko.

891
01:11:16.614 --> 01:11:19.483
Ray.
For a moment...

892
01:11:19.803 --> 01:11:25.228
...pretend that I don't know anything
about metallurgy, engineering or physics...

893
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:28.160
...and just tell me what
the hell is going on.

894
01:11:28.647 --> 01:11:30.347
You never studied.

895
01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:35.019
The whole building is a huge
superconductive antenna...

896
01:11:35.194 --> 01:11:37.693
...that was designed and
built expressly for the purpose...

897
01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:41.107
...of pulling in and concentrating
spiritual turbulence.

898
01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:46.799
Your girlfriend lives in the
corner penthouse of spook central.

899
01:11:48.262 --> 01:11:49.938
She's not my girlfriend.

900
01:11:50.961 --> 01:11:54.602
I find her interesting because she's a client
and because sleeps above her covers.

901
01:11:54.637 --> 01:11:58.729
Four feet above her covers.
She barks. She drools. She claws.

902
01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:00.961
It's not the girl, Peter,
it's the building.

903
01:12:01.397 --> 01:12:05.528
Something terrible is about to enter our world,
and this building is obviously the door.

904
01:12:05.563 --> 01:12:07.622
The architect's name
was Ivo Shandor.

905
01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:11.393
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
He was also a doctor.

906
01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:14.014
Performed a lot
of unnecessary surgery.

907
01:12:14.202 --> 01:12:17.243
And then, in 1920,
he started a secret society.

908
01:12:17.278 --> 01:12:20.953
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
- Right.

909
01:12:21.926 --> 01:12:23.363
No studying.

910
01:12:23.574 --> 01:12:28.524
After the first World War, Shandor decided
that society was too sick to survive.

911
01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.923
And he wasn't alone. He had close
to a thousand followers when he died.

912
01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:38.075
They conducted rituals
up on the roof...

913
01:12:38.169 --> 01:12:41.808
...bizarre rituals intended to bring
about the end of the world.

914
01:12:41.843 --> 01:12:45.100
And now it looks like
it may actually happen.

915
01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:49.411
<i>So be good...
For goodness' sake...</i>

916
01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:53.003
<i>- Whoa, somebody's coming...</i>
- We have to get out of here.

917
01:12:53.075 --> 01:12:54.465
- We gotta find a judge or something.
<i>- Somebody's coming...</i>

918
01:12:54.468 --> 01:12:57.087
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

919
01:12:57.478 --> 01:12:58.488
Hold it.

920
01:12:58.493 --> 01:13:00.301
Are we actually going to go
before a federal judge...

921
01:13:00.304 --> 01:13:05.673
...and say that some moldy Babylonian god is gonna drop
in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city?

922
01:13:05.676 --> 01:13:08.451
- Sumerian, not Babylonian.
- Yeah, big difference.

923
01:13:08.605 --> 01:13:11.461
No offense,
but I gotta get my own lawyer.

924
01:13:11.575 --> 01:13:14.619
Okay, Ghostbusters.
The mayor wants to see you guys.

925
01:13:14.654 --> 01:13:16.614
The whole island's going crazy.
Let's go.

926
01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:19.868
I gotta split. The mayor wants to
rap with me about some things.

927
01:13:43.901 --> 01:13:47.688
- I am the Keymaster.
- I am the Gatekeeper.

928
01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:34.221
- Back. Back. Stay back.
- Stay back. Stay back.

929
01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.656
I've got a city blowing up,
and you guys are not giving me answers.

930
01:14:44.659 --> 01:14:47.901
We're blocking the bridges,
the roads...

931
01:14:48.303 --> 01:14:49.762
The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor.

932
01:14:49.834 --> 01:14:52.380
The Ghostbusters.
Okay, the Ghostbusters.

933
01:14:52.677 --> 01:14:54.441
Hey, and where's this Peck?

934
01:14:54.665 --> 01:14:55.421
<i>Peck.</i>

935
01:14:55.425 --> 01:14:58.811
I am Walter Peck, sir, and
I am prepared to make a full report.

936
01:14:58.814 --> 01:15:01.248
These men are consummate
snowball artists.

937
01:15:01.328 --> 01:15:04.306
They use sense and nerve gases
to induce hallucinations.

938
01:15:04.341 --> 01:15:06.414
People think they're seeing ghosts...

939
01:15:06.556 --> 01:15:12.092
...and they call these bozos who conveniently show up to
deal with the problem with a fake electronic light show.

940
01:15:12.313 --> 01:15:16.639
Everything was fine with our system until
the power grid was shut off by dickless here.

941
01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.838
They caused an explosion.

942
01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:24.455
- Is this true?
- Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

943
01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:29.735
Hey, come on. Knock it off.
Hey, break it up.

944
01:15:29.945 --> 01:15:31.701
- All right, all right, all right.
- Well, that's what I heard.

945
01:15:31.704 --> 01:15:33.291
This is City Hall.

946
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.593
Now, what am I gonna do here, John?
What is this?

947
01:15:36.884 --> 01:15:39.769
All I know is that was no light show
we saw this morning.

948
01:15:39.804 --> 01:15:42.877
I've seen every form
of combustion known to man...

949
01:15:43.959 --> 01:15:45.484
...but this beats the hell out of me.

950
01:15:45.551 --> 01:15:48.308
The walls in the 53rd Precinct
were bleeding.

951
01:15:48.573 --> 01:15:51.094
- How do you explain that?
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

952
01:15:51.244 --> 01:15:52.917
Oh, Your Eminence.

953
01:15:58.729 --> 01:16:01.581
- How are you, Lenny?
- You're looking good, Mike.

954
01:16:01.616 --> 01:16:05.209
We're in a real fix here.
What do you think I should do?

955
01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:11.798
Lenny, officially, the church will not take any position
on the religious implications of these phenomena.

956
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:13.453
Personally, Lenny...

957
01:16:13.913 --> 01:16:18.018
...I think it's a sign from God.
But don't quote me on that.

958
01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:19.805
Oh, I think that's
a smart move, Mike.

959
01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:23.892
I'm not gonna call a press conference
and tell everyone to start praying.

960
01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.141
I'm... uh...
Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

961
01:16:29.555 --> 01:16:31.924
Look, I've only been with the company
for a couple weeks.

962
01:16:31.959 --> 01:16:34.943
But I gotta tell you,
these things are real.

963
01:16:34.978 --> 01:16:39.043
Since I joined these men,
I have seen shit that'll turn you white.

964
01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.381
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

965
01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:42.950
My name is Peck.

966
01:16:42.954 --> 01:16:47.659
Or you could accept the fact that this city is
headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.

967
01:16:47.694 --> 01:16:49.292
What do you mean, biblical?

968
01:16:49.295 --> 01:16:51.680
- What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor.
- Yes.

969
01:16:51.683 --> 01:16:53.850
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff.
- Exactly.

970
01:16:53.885 --> 01:16:57.579
Fire and brimstone coming down from
the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

971
01:16:57.582 --> 01:16:59.919
Forty years of darkness.
Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

972
01:16:59.922 --> 01:17:02.683
- Dead rising from the grave.
- Human sacrifice.

973
01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:05.624
Dogs and cats living together.
Mass hysteria.

974
01:17:05.627 --> 01:17:07.452
Enough.
I get the point.

975
01:17:10.029 --> 01:17:11.231
But what if you're wrong?

976
01:17:11.321 --> 01:17:14.807
If I'm wrong, nothing happens.
We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

977
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:17.649
We'll enjoy it.
But if I'm right...

978
01:17:18.627 --> 01:17:20.647
...and we can stop this thing...

979
01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:27.154
...Lenny, you will have
saved the lives...

980
01:17:27.508 --> 01:17:31.415
...of millions of registered voters.

981
01:17:37.227 --> 01:17:40.582
I don't believe you're seriously
considering listening to these men.

982
01:17:48.477 --> 01:17:50.656
Get him out of here.

983
01:17:51.047 --> 01:17:53.945
- Bye.
- I'll fix you, Venkman. I'm gonna fix you.

984
01:17:53.979 --> 01:17:56.717
I'm gonna get you a nice fruit basket.
I'm gonna miss him.

985
01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.133
All right, all right.

986
01:17:58.824 --> 01:18:02.086
We got work to do.
Now, what do you need from me?

987
01:18:16.253 --> 01:18:18.288
Come on,
let's run some red lights.

988
01:19:21.043 --> 01:19:22.432
Hello, New York.

989
01:19:29.089 --> 01:19:30.723
Hello, everybody.

990
01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:35.479
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please?
The heart of the Ghostbusters.

991
01:19:35.514 --> 01:19:38.839
Thank you. They love you.
They love you here.

992
01:19:39.288 --> 01:19:43.285
- I like that shirt, friend.
- Ghostbusters. All right.

993
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:49.026
Gotta run.
Got a date with a ghost.

994
01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.192
Okay, whatever happens,
let's be professional.

995
01:20:24.303 --> 01:20:27.313
We might have to put a little
overtime in on this one.

996
01:21:22.254 --> 01:21:25.283
<i>There they are.
There they are.</i>

997
01:21:31.888 --> 01:21:34.121
I was in no way prepared for that.

998
01:21:35.608 --> 01:21:38.748
It's all right. Don't worry.
We're fine. We can handle it.

999
01:21:38.751 --> 01:21:40.987
We can take it.
They want to play rough.

1000
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:43.807
Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters.
Ghostbusters.

1001
01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:47.523
Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters.
Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters.

1002
01:21:47.558 --> 01:21:49.155
- You wanna play rough?
- Yeah.

1003
01:21:49.190 --> 01:21:50.865
Let's do it.

1004
01:22:16.104 --> 01:22:17.548
Where are we?

1005
01:22:18.299 --> 01:22:21.372
It looks like we're
in the teens...

1006
01:22:21.375 --> 01:22:22.601
- ...somewhere.
- Okay.

1007
01:22:22.616 --> 01:22:26.295
Well, when we get to 20, tell me.
I'm gonna throw up.

1008
01:22:58.446 --> 01:23:02.573
- Twenty-two. Is this it?
- Yep.

1009
01:23:12.002 --> 01:23:14.102
Art deco.
Very nice.

1010
01:23:14.887 --> 01:23:17.157
- Where is it?
- It's at the end of the hall.

1011
01:23:58.142 --> 01:24:00.017
Hey, where do these stairs go?

1012
01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:04.627
They go up.

1013
01:24:09.591 --> 01:24:11.722
Okay, go ahead.
Come on. Go ahead.

1014
01:24:13.339 --> 01:24:14.812
Watch it.
Go ahead.

1015
01:24:54.424 --> 01:24:55.702
Dana.

1016
01:25:10.365 --> 01:25:13.702
Okay, so... she's a dog.

1017
01:25:53.805 --> 01:25:55.379
It's a girl.

1018
01:26:00.819 --> 01:26:03.322
- It's Gozer.
- I thought Gozer was a man.

1019
01:26:03.357 --> 01:26:07.082
- It's whatever it wants to be.
- Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1020
01:26:07.455 --> 01:26:08.937
Right.

1021
01:26:09.577 --> 01:26:11.283
Go get her, Ray.

1022
01:26:23.984 --> 01:26:26.020
Gozer the Gozerian?

1023
01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:29.819
Good evening.

1024
01:26:30.314 --> 01:26:35.374
As a duly designated representative
of the city, county and state of New York...

1025
01:26:35.377 --> 01:26:40.066
...I order you to cease any and all supernatural
activity and return forthwith to your place of origin...

1026
01:26:40.135 --> 01:26:43.102
...or to the nearest convenient
parallel dimension.

1027
01:26:43.308 --> 01:26:45.351
That ought to do it.
Thanks very much, Ray.

1028
01:26:45.952 --> 01:26:49.364
Are you a god?

1029
01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:58.322
- No.
- Then...

1030
01:26:58.942 --> 01:27:01.763
...die.

1031
01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:30.147
Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1032
01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:35.539
All right.
This chick is toast.

1033
01:27:48.275 --> 01:27:51.330
- Got your stick?
- Holding it.

1034
01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:53.898
Heat them up.

1035
01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:55.973
Smoking.

1036
01:27:56.936 --> 01:27:59.669
- Make them hard.
- Ready.

1037
01:27:59.855 --> 01:28:03.387
Let's show this prehistoric bitch
how we do things downtown.

1038
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:07.419
Throw it.

1039
01:28:16.107 --> 01:28:19.115
- Nimble little minx, isn't she?
- We better go full stream.

1040
01:28:20.119 --> 01:28:21.758
Aim for the flattop.

1041
01:28:32.207 --> 01:28:33.833
Wasn't so hard.

1042
01:28:40.293 --> 01:28:41.955
We neutronized it.

1043
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:44.446
You know what that means?
A complete particle reversal.

1044
01:28:44.672 --> 01:28:47.588
And we had the tools.
We had the talent.

1045
01:28:47.807 --> 01:28:49.407
It's Miller time.

1046
01:28:50.193 --> 01:28:54.736
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad.
- Oh, no.

1047
01:28:55.158 --> 01:28:56.731
What?

1048
01:29:06.021 --> 01:29:07.685
Look out.

1049
01:29:30.375 --> 01:29:36.504
<i>Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian,
Gozer the Destructor...</i>

1050
01:29:36.579 --> 01:29:41.469
<i>...Volguus Zildrohar
the Traveler has come.</i>

1051
01:29:41.504 --> 01:29:44.103
<i>Choose and perish.</i>

1052
01:29:44.477 --> 01:29:47.826
What do you mean, choose?
We don't understand.

1053
01:29:48.112 --> 01:29:53.639
<i>Choose. Choose the form
of the Destructor.</i>

1054
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.087
Oh, I get it. I get it, oh.
Very cute.

1055
01:29:59.156 --> 01:30:02.056
Whatever we think of.
If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1056
01:30:02.136 --> 01:30:05.443
...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and
destroy us, okay? So empty your heads.

1057
01:30:05.615 --> 01:30:08.631
Empty your heads. Don't think of anything.
We've only got one shot at this.

1058
01:30:08.749 --> 01:30:11.365
<i>The choice is made.</i>

1059
01:30:12.563 --> 01:30:14.844
<i>The Traveler has come.</i>

1060
01:30:14.849 --> 01:30:17.100
Nobody choosed anything.

1061
01:30:17.163 --> 01:30:18.693
- Did you choose anything?
- No.

1062
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:20.124
- Did you?
- My mind is totally blank.

1063
01:30:20.441 --> 01:30:22.370
I didn't choose anything.

1064
01:30:32.515 --> 01:30:34.414
I couldn't help it.

1065
01:30:35.365 --> 01:30:37.283
It just popped in there.

1066
01:30:38.302 --> 01:30:41.985
What?
What just popped in there?

1067
01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:45.167
- I... I... I tried to think...
- Look.

1068
01:30:45.826 --> 01:30:48.152
- No. It can't be.
- What is it?

1069
01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.229
- It can't be.
- What did you do, Ray?

1070
01:30:50.361 --> 01:30:52.062
Oh, shit.

1071
01:31:03.513 --> 01:31:05.646
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1072
01:31:16.646 --> 01:31:26.646
Correction & Arrangement by BANQUO
(alacayel@gmail.com)

1073
01:31:37.093 --> 01:31:38.911
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1074
01:31:39.077 --> 01:31:41.121
I tried to think of
the most harmless thing.

1075
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:43.178
Something I loved
from my childhood.

1076
01:31:43.408 --> 01:31:47.701
Something that could never, ever
possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1077
01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:50.099
Nice thinking, Ray.

1078
01:31:51.257 --> 01:31:53.384
We used to roast
Stay Puft marshmallows...

1079
01:31:53.678 --> 01:31:55.405
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1080
01:31:57.231 --> 01:32:01.433
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1081
01:32:01.841 --> 01:32:06.338
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond
the capacity for rational thought.

1082
01:32:16.976 --> 01:32:19.972
- Oh, no.
- Mother pus bucket.

1083
01:32:24.685 --> 01:32:27.184
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1084
01:32:27.301 --> 01:32:30.655
One, two, three, roast him.

1085
01:32:50.223 --> 01:32:52.020
Funny, us going out like this.

1086
01:32:52.029 --> 01:32:54.542
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1087
01:32:54.646 --> 01:32:57.295
We've been going about this wrong.
This Mr. Stay Puft is okay.

1088
01:32:57.306 --> 01:32:58.999
He's a sailor.
He's in New York.

1089
01:32:59.083 --> 01:33:01.494
We get this guy laid,
we won't have any trouble.

1090
01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:06.927
I have a radical idea.

1091
01:33:07.569 --> 01:33:11.293
The door swings both ways. We could
reverse the particle flow through the gate.

1092
01:33:11.295 --> 01:33:12.408
<i>How?</i>

1093
01:33:13.602 --> 01:33:15.843
- We'll cross the streams.
- Excuse me, Egon.

1094
01:33:15.878 --> 01:33:17.468
You said crossing the streams
was bad.

1095
01:33:17.635 --> 01:33:20.937
- Cross the streams.
- You're gonna endanger us.

1096
01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:22.941
You're gonna endanger our client...

1097
01:33:22.991 --> 01:33:26.166
...the nice lady who paid us in
advance before she became a dog.

1098
01:33:26.201 --> 01:33:30.472
Not necessarily. There's definitely
a very slim chance we'll survive.

1099
01:33:36.015 --> 01:33:39.887
I love this plan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1100
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:43.048
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1101
01:33:47.386 --> 01:33:48.809
Hurry.

1102
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.474
See you on the other side, Ray.

1103
01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:57.798
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1104
01:34:06.275 --> 01:34:08.313
Let's turn them on, Spengler.

1105
01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:14.181
Now, Spengler.

1106
01:34:18.848 --> 01:34:20.379
Get out of here.

1107
01:35:13.976 --> 01:35:15.369
Winston.

1108
01:35:16.352 --> 01:35:17.705
Are you all right?

1109
01:35:23.387 --> 01:35:24.663
Venkman.

1110
01:35:25.076 --> 01:35:26.342
Spengler.

1111
01:35:27.331 --> 01:35:28.807
Venkman.

1112
01:35:32.104 --> 01:35:33.608
Spengler.

1113
01:35:35.083 --> 01:35:37.971
Oh, Spengler.
Oh, are you okay?

1114
01:35:38.204 --> 01:35:40.382
I feel like the floor
of a taxicab.

1115
01:35:40.385 --> 01:35:42.403
- Venky.
- Yeah, where are you?

1116
01:35:42.705 --> 01:35:44.438
Oh, thank God.

1117
01:35:46.169 --> 01:35:47.932
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

1118
01:35:48.232 --> 01:35:49.212
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

1119
01:35:49.215 --> 01:35:51.830
- You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?

1120
01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:53.339
Fine.

1121
01:36:00.955 --> 01:36:04.432
Oh, it smells like
barbecued dog hair.

1122
01:36:05.409 --> 01:36:07.447
Oh, Venkman.

1123
01:36:07.529 --> 01:36:09.555
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1124
01:36:10.368 --> 01:36:13.415
I'm sorry. I... I...
I just... I just forgot.

1125
01:36:27.836 --> 01:36:29.158
Look.

1126
01:36:56.498 --> 01:36:59.060
Somebody turn on the lights.

1127
01:36:59.559 --> 01:37:01.922
- Help, somebody.
- Go check on that little guy.

1128
01:37:08.089 --> 01:37:09.529
What happened?

1129
01:37:19.213 --> 01:37:20.752
Where am I?

1130
01:37:22.909 --> 01:37:25.510
Oh. Hi.

1131
01:37:26.427 --> 01:37:27.832
You'll be all right.

1132
01:37:28.655 --> 01:37:31.782
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1133
01:37:33.549 --> 01:37:35.088
Are you okay?

1134
01:37:36.133 --> 01:37:37.868
Who are you guys?

1135
01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.279
We're the Ghostbusters.

1136
01:37:43.181 --> 01:37:44.885
Who does your taxes?

1137
01:37:45.248 --> 01:37:48.379
You know, Mr. Tully,
you are a most fortunate individual.

1138
01:37:48.555 --> 01:37:49.581
I know.

1139
01:37:49.715 --> 01:37:54.944
You have been a participant in the biggest
interdimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1140
01:37:54.947 --> 01:37:56.235
Felt great.

1141
01:37:56.256 --> 01:37:59.649
- We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue.
- Okay.

1142
01:38:03.007 --> 01:38:05.916
I love this town.

1143
01:38:49.462 --> 01:38:50.907
Egon.

1144
01:38:58.539 --> 01:39:00.121
What's going on?

1145
01:39:01.479 --> 01:39:03.817
Does anybody want to interview me?

1146
01:39:03.897 --> 01:39:06.914
I'm an eyewitness.
I was up there.

1147
01:39:07.997 --> 01:39:10.248
I want to go with them
in the car.
