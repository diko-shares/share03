WEBVTT

1
00:00:55.097 --> 00:00:57.516
Po" Lazarus.

2
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.019
Well, the high sheriff

3
00:01:00.102 --> 00:01:02.897
He told the deputy

4
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.319
Won't you go out and bring me Lazarus

5
00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.616
Well, the high sheriff

6
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:16.410
He told the deputy

7
00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:22.208
Won't you go out and bring me Lazarus

8
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.922
Bring him dead or alive

9
00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.091
O Lord

10
00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.177
Bring him dead or alive

11
00:01:35.513 --> 00:01:37.848
Well, the deputy

12
00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:40.726
He told the high sheriff

13
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.773
Well, I ain't gonna mess with Lazarus

14
00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:51.195
Well, the deputy

15
00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.030
told the high sheriff

16
00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:59.704
Said I ain't gonna mess with Lazarus

17
00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:01.387
Pick up that hammer there, boy.

18
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:03.416
Thank you, boss.

19
00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.296
He's a dangerous man

20
00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.172
Oh, Lord

21
00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:13.592
He's a dangerous man

22
00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:18.431
Come on, get it. Let's go.

23
00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:17.818
Say,

24
00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:19.987
any of you boys smithies?

25
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.658
Or if not smithies, per se,

26
00:05:24.742 --> 00:05:26.702
were you otherwise trained
in the metallurgic arts

27
00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:28.054
- before straitened circumstances...

28
00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:29.958
forced you into a life
of aimless wanderin'?

29
00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.511
Jesus! Can't I count on you people?

30
00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.137
Sorry, Everett.

31
00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:48.349
Well, all right.

32
00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:52.019
- If we take off through that bayou...
Wait a minute.

33
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:54.855
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

34
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.360
Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one
with the capacity for abstract thought.

35
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:02.323
But if that ain't the consensus view,
then hell, let's put her to a vote.

36
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:05.074
Suits me. I'm votin' for yours truly.

37
00:06:05.157 --> 00:06:07.451
I'm votin' for yours truly, too.

38
00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:15.334
Okay, I'm with you fellas.

39
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.070
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

40
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:46.657
Join me, my sons. Join me.

41
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:52.913
You work
for the railroad, Grandpa?

42
00:06:52.997 --> 00:06:55.416
I work for no man.

43
00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.042
Got a name, do ya?

44
00:06:57.126 --> 00:06:59.587
I have no name.

45
00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:02.673
Well, that right there may be the reason

46
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.651
you've had difficulty
findin' gainful employment.

47
00:07:04.675 --> 00:07:07.177
You see, in the mart
of competitive commerce...

48
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.263
You seek a great fortune,

49
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.974
you three who are nigh in chains.

50
00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.435
You will find a fortune,

51
00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:17.855
though it will not be the fortune you seek.

52
00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.024
But first,

53
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:23.360
first, you must travel

54
00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:27.031
a long and difficult road.

55
00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:31.035
A road fraught with peril, mmm-hmm.

56
00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.330
You shall see things

57
00:07:35.414 --> 00:07:37.750
wonderful to tell.

58
00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:41.211
You shall see a cow

59
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:46.216
on the roof of a cotton house.

60
00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.678
And, oh, so many startlements.

61
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:54.308
I cannot tell you how
long this road shall be,

62
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.770
but fear not the obstacles in your path,

63
00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:02.149
for fate has vouchsafed your reward.

64
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.110
Though the road may wind,

65
00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:08.572
and yea, your hearts grow weary,

66
00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.450
still shall ye follow the road,

67
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:14.912
even unto your salvation.

68
00:08:29.802 --> 00:08:32.402
The treasure's
still there, boys. Believe me.

69
00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.015
But how'd he know
about the treasure?

70
00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.684
I don't know, Delmar.

71
00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:39.019
The blind are reputed
to possess sensitivities

72
00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:41.021
compensatin' for their lack of sight,

73
00:08:41.105 --> 00:08:44.441
even to the point of developin'
paranormal psychic powers.

74
00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:47.861
Now, clearly, seeing in the future
would fall neatly into that category.

75
00:08:47.945 --> 00:08:49.613
It's not so surprising then

76
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:52.074
that an organism
deprived of its earthly vision...

77
00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.536
He said we wouldn't
get the treasure we seek

78
00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:57.538
on account of our obstacles.

79
00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:00.249
What the hell does he know?
He's an ignorant old man.

80
00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:02.960
Jesus, Pete. I told ya I buried it myself.

81
00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.671
If your cousin still has
this here horse farm,

82
00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.834
and a forge and some shoein' impediments
to restore our liberty of movement...

83
00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:11.927
Hold it right there!

84
00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.100
- You men from the bank?
You Wash's boy?

85
00:09:18.183 --> 00:09:21.812
Yes, sir. Daddy told me
I'm to shoot whoever's from the bank.

86
00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:24.440
Well, we ain't from the bank,
young feller.

87
00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:27.693
Yes, sir. I'm also supposed
to shoot folks servin' papers.

88
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.670
We ain't got no papers neither.

89
00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:31.739
I nicked the census man.

90
00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:33.365
Now, there's a good boy.

91
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.326
Is your daddy about?

92
00:09:49.757 --> 00:09:52.843
Hello, Pete. Who are your friends?

93
00:09:54.553 --> 00:09:56.889
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr Hogwallop.

94
00:09:56.972 --> 00:09:59.975
- My name's Ulysses Everett McGill.
- And I'm Delmar O'Donnell.

95
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:04.104
How you been, Wash?

96
00:10:04.188 --> 00:10:06.982
Been what, 12, 13 years?

97
00:10:09.902 --> 00:10:11.695
Yep.

98
00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:14.698
I expect you want them chains knocked off.

99
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.535
They foreclosed on Cousin Vester.

100
00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:21.538
He hanged himself a year come May.

101
00:10:22.164 --> 00:10:23.874
And Uncle Ratliff?

102
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:28.378
The anthrax took most of his cows.
The rest don't milk.

103
00:10:29.004 --> 00:10:31.089
And he lost a boy to mumps.

104
00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.383
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

105
00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:40.140
Couldn't say.

106
00:10:42.226 --> 00:10:43.685
Mrs Hogwallop up and

107
00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:47.231
R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

108
00:10:49.775 --> 00:10:51.360
She must've been lookin' for answers.

109
00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:53.111
Possibly.

110
00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:56.490
Good riddance, as far as I'm concerned.

111
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.492
I do miss her cookin' though.

112
00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.245
- This stew's awful good.
You think so?

113
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:05.332
I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

114
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.335
I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

115
00:11:13.799 --> 00:11:16.635
You are my sunshine

116
00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:19.054
My only sunshine

117
00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.682
You make me happy

118
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:24.476
when skies are grey

119
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.062
You'll never know, dear

120
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:29.898
how much I love you

121
00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:34.945
Please don't take my sunshine away

122
00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:37.865
Well, that winds up tonight's

123
00:11:37.948 --> 00:11:40.617
Pass the Biscuits Pappy
O'Daniel Flour Hour.

124
00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:43.787
This is Pappy O'Daniel,
hopin' you folks been enjoyin'

125
00:11:43.871 --> 00:11:46.039
that good, old-timey music.

126
00:11:46.123 --> 00:11:49.209
And remember,
when you're fixin' to fry up some flapjacks

127
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:50.878
or bake a mess of biscuits,

128
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:53.088
use cool, clear water

129
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:55.924
and good, pure Pappy O'Daniel flour.

130
00:11:57.509 --> 00:12:00.137
Well, guess I'll be turnin'in.

131
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.598
Say, Cousin Wash,

132
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:07.185
I suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness
to inquire if you had a hairnet.

133
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:10.147
Got a bunch in yon bureau.

134
00:12:11.023 --> 00:12:13.442
Mrs Hogwallop's, matter of fact.

135
00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:15.861
Help yourself.

136
00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.738
I won't be needin' them.

137
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.501
All right, boys!

138
00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:35.255
- How's my hair?
It's the authorities!

139
00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:38.008
We got ya surrounded!

140
00:12:38.216 --> 00:12:40.052
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

141
00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:42.554
Just come on out a-grabbin' air!

142
00:12:43.055 --> 00:12:45.182
And don't try nothin' fancy!

143
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:48.518
Your situation is purt nigh hopeless!

144
00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.146
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

145
00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.606
What in the Sam Hill...

146
00:12:52.689 --> 00:12:54.608
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty.

147
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:56.360
The hell you say!

148
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.321
- Wash is kin!
Sorry, Pete!

149
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:03.200
I know we're Kin,
but they got this Depression on.

150
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.202
I got to do for me and mine.

151
00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:09.748
I'm gonna Kill you,
Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!

152
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.584
- You miserable, horse-eatin', son of a...

153
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:16.296
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

154
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.048
Damn his eyes!

155
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.051
Pa always said, "Never trust a Hogwallop".

156
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.554
Come and get us, coppers!

157
00:13:26.264 --> 00:13:30.310
You boys are leavin' us no choice
but to smoke you out!

158
00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:31.874
Damn! We're in a tight spot.

159
00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:34.398
Light 'er up!
Hold up, boys!

160
00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.942
Ain't you never heard of negotiatin'?

161
00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.277
Maybe we can talk this out! I hate fire!

162
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:43.115
You lousy, low-down,
yellow-bellied skunks!

163
00:13:43.198 --> 00:13:45.998
We gotta speak with one voice, here.
Careful with that fire, now, boys!

164
00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.455
That's enough, sir.

165
00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.542
I hate fire!

166
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:57.212
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

167
00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:02.509
Holy Saint Christopher!

168
00:14:02.718 --> 00:14:05.846
Get away from that vehicle, chaps!
She's lickin' fire!

169
00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:11.476
Take cover, boys! That ain't popcorn!

170
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.112
Scatter, boys!

171
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.916
Get in, boys. I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

172
00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:38.962
- Come on, boss! Come on! Come on!

173
00:14:39.963 --> 00:14:43.300
What are you doin' here?
You oughta be in bed, crumbsnatcher.

174
00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:45.469
You ain't the boss of me!

175
00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:56.855
You candy-butted, car-thievin' so-and-sos!

176
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.857
I curse yer names!

177
00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.568
Go back home and mind your pa.

178
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.699
What's the damn problem?

179
00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:12.913
I can get the part from Bristol.
It'll take two weeks.

180
00:15:12.996 --> 00:15:14.998
- Here's your pomade.
Two weeks?

181
00:15:15.082 --> 00:15:19.169
- That don't do me no good.
- Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

182
00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.881
Hold on, now. I don't want this pomade.
I want Dapper Dan.

183
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:26.093
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.

184
00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:29.763
Well, I don't want Fop, God damn it!
I'm a Dapper Dan man.

185
00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:32.599
Watch your language, young fella.
This is a public market.

186
00:15:32.682 --> 00:15:35.102
Now, if you want Dapper Dan,
I can order it for you,

187
00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:36.603
have it in a couple of weeks.

188
00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:39.648
Well, ain't this place
a geographical oddity.

189
00:15:39.815 --> 00:15:42.359
Two weeks from everywhere. Forget it.

190
00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.403
A dozen hairnets.

191
00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:50.242
Well, it didn't look like a one-horse town.

192
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:53.995
- But try finding a decent hair jelly.
- Gopher, Everett?

193
00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.706
And no transmission belt
for two weeks neither.

194
00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:00.293
They dam that river on the 21st.

195
00:16:00.377 --> 00:16:02.629
- Today's the 17th.
- Don't I know it.

196
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.549
We got but four days
to get to that treasure.

197
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.968
After that, it'll be at
the bottom of a lake.

198
00:16:09.136 --> 00:16:10.720
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

199
00:16:10.804 --> 00:16:12.973
That's right.
- Gopher, Everett?

200
00:16:13.056 --> 00:16:15.559
But the old tactician's got a plan.

201
00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:17.370
For the transportation, that is.

202
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:19.563
I don't know how
I'm gonna keep my coiffure in order.

203
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:23.024
How's this a plan? How we gonna get a car?

204
00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:27.571
Sell that. I figure it can only have
painful association for Wash.

205
00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:32.200
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop,

206
00:16:32.868 --> 00:16:34.911
"from his lovin' Cora".

207
00:16:39.291 --> 00:16:42.169
It was in his bureau.
I reckon it'll fetch us enough cash

208
00:16:42.252 --> 00:16:44.671
for a good used autovoiture
and a little left over besides.

209
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:48.008
Hoo! You got some light fingers, Everett.

210
00:16:48.091 --> 00:16:49.134
Gopher?

211
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.012
You miserable, little sneak.

212
00:16:52.095 --> 00:16:54.055
You stole from my kin!

213
00:16:55.432 --> 00:16:59.102
- Who was fixin' to betray us.
- You didn't know that at the time!

214
00:16:59.186 --> 00:17:01.271
So I borrowed it till I did know.

215
00:17:01.396 --> 00:17:03.523
That don't make no sense!

216
00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:06.651
Pete, it's a fool who looks for logic
in the chambers of the human heart.

217
00:17:06.735 --> 00:17:09.154
- What the hell is that singing?

218
00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.285
Appears to be some kind of a

219
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:17.954
congregation.

220
00:17:18.747 --> 00:17:20.707
Care for some gopher?

221
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:25.754
No, thank you, Delmar.

222
00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.049
A third of a gopher
would only arouse my appetite

223
00:17:29.132 --> 00:17:31.301
without beddin' her back down.

224
00:17:31.676 --> 00:17:33.803
You can have the whole thing.

225
00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.640
Me and Pete already had one.

226
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.851
We ran across

227
00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:44.314
a whole gopher village.

228
00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:52.906
O brothers, let's go down

229
00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:56.743
Let's go down. Come on down

230
00:17:56.826 --> 00:18:00.455
Come on, brothers, let's go down

231
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:04.751
Down in the river to pray

232
00:18:05.126 --> 00:18:09.005
As I went down in the river to pray

233
00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:12.259
Studying about that good old way

234
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:15.845
And who shall wear the starry crown

235
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:19.432
Good Lord, show me the way

236
00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:24.104
O fathers, let's go down

237
00:18:24.187 --> 00:18:27.774
Let's go down. Come on down

238
00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.486
O fathers, let's go down

239
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:34.864
Down in the river to pray

240
00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:40.161
As I went down in the river to pray

241
00:18:40.245 --> 00:18:43.498
Studying about that good old way

242
00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:47.043
And who shall wear the robe and crown

243
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:50.964
Good Lord, show me the way

244
00:18:52.173 --> 00:18:55.635
O mothers, let's go down

245
00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:59.264
Come on down. Don't you wanna go down?

246
00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:02.892
Come on, mothers, let's go down

247
00:19:02.976 --> 00:19:06.438
Well, I guess hard times flush the chumps.

248
00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:08.606
Everybody's lookin' for answers.
There's always...

249
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:13.903
Where the hell's he goin'?

250
00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:27.250
Thank you.

251
00:19:27.334 --> 00:19:29.502
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

252
00:19:30.086 --> 00:19:31.755
Delmar's been saved.

253
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.633
Well, that's it, boys. I've been redeemed.

254
00:19:35.717 --> 00:19:40.055
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

255
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.849
It's the straight and
narrow from here on out,

256
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.560
and heaven everlastin's my reward.

257
00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.897
Delmar, what are you talkin' about?
We got bigger fish to fry.

258
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.400
The preacher said all my sins
is washed away,

259
00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:55.487
includin' that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

260
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.650
I thought you said
you was innocent of those charges.

261
00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.617
Well, I was lyin'.

262
00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:04.245
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

263
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.832
Neither God nor man's
got nothin' on me now.

264
00:20:07.916 --> 00:20:11.252
Come on in, boys. The water is fine.

265
00:20:18.927 --> 00:20:21.471
Come on, boy.
That a boy. Good dog.

266
00:20:25.183 --> 00:20:26.810
We got the scent!

267
00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.399
The preacher said it absolved us.

268
00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:34.567
For him, not for the law.

269
00:20:34.818 --> 00:20:37.630
I'm surprised at you, Pete. I gave
you credit for more brains than Delmar.

270
00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:40.240
But there was witnesses seen us redeemed.

271
00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:41.908
That's not the issue, Delmar.

272
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.636
Even if it did put you
square with the Lord,

273
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.700
the State of Mississippi's
a little more hard-nosed.

274
00:20:45.745 --> 00:20:48.873
You should've joined us, Everett.
It couldn't have hurt none.

275
00:20:48.957 --> 00:20:52.919
Hell, at least it would've washed away
the stink of that pomade.

276
00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:55.755
Join you two ignorant fools
in a ridiculous superstition?

277
00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:58.425
Thank you, anyway.
And I like the smell of my hair treatment.

278
00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:00.552
The pleasin' odour's half the point.

279
00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:04.013
Baptism.

280
00:21:04.556 --> 00:21:06.933
You two are just dumber
than a bag of hammers.

281
00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.810
Well, I guess you're just my cross to bear.

282
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:12.230
Pull over, Everett.
Let's give that coloured boy a lift.

283
00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:22.031
You folks goin' past Tishomingo?

284
00:21:22.365 --> 00:21:23.825
Sure. Hop in.

285
00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.253
How ya doin', son? Name's Everett.

286
00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:38.381
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

287
00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.383
Keep your fingers away from Pete's mouth.

288
00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.135
He ain't had nothin' to eat for 13 years,

289
00:21:42.218 --> 00:21:44.846
except prison food, gopher
and a little greasy horse.

290
00:21:45.054 --> 00:21:49.392
Thanks for the lift, sir.
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

291
00:21:49.476 --> 00:21:51.269
How ya doin', Tommy?

292
00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:54.898
Say, I haven't seen
a house out here for miles.

293
00:21:54.981 --> 00:21:57.400
What are you doin'
out in the middle of nowhere?

294
00:21:57.484 --> 00:22:00.320
Well, I had to be at
that there crossroads last midnight

295
00:22:00.403 --> 00:22:01.946
to sell my soul to the devil.

296
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:05.325
Well, ain't it a small world,
spiritually speakin'?

297
00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:07.911
Pete and Delmar
just been baptized and saved.

298
00:22:07.994 --> 00:22:10.205
I guess I'm the only one
that remains unaffiliated.

299
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:12.099
This ain't
no laughin' matter, Everett.

300
00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:13.963
What'd the devil give you
for your soul, Tommy?

301
00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.504
He taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

302
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:18.922
Oh, son.

303
00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:21.966
For that, you traded your everlastin' soul?

304
00:22:22.383 --> 00:22:23.968
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

305
00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:28.515
I've always wondered...
What's the devil look like?

306
00:22:28.598 --> 00:22:32.227
Well, of course, there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons, Pete,

307
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.979
but the great Satan
hisself is red and scaly

308
00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:37.190
with a bifurcated tail,
and he carries a hay fork.

309
00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:39.651
Oh, no. No, sir.

310
00:22:39.943 --> 00:22:41.319
He's white.

311
00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:43.071
He's white as you folks

312
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.658
with empty eyes and a big, hollow voice.

313
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:50.370
He love to travel around
with a mean, old hound, that's right.

314
00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:52.580
And he told you to go to Tishomingo?

315
00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:55.833
Well, no, sir. Why, that was my idea.

316
00:22:55.917 --> 00:22:57.835
I heard there's a man down there,

317
00:22:57.919 --> 00:23:00.338
he pays folks money to sing into his can.

318
00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:04.175
They say he pays extra
if'n you play real good.

319
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.427
Tishomingo, huh?

320
00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.096
How much he pay?

321
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:27.574
All right, boys, follow my lead.

322
00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:34.998
Hello?

323
00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:38.459
Who's the honcho around here?

324
00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:41.254
I am. Who are you?

325
00:23:41.337 --> 00:23:43.256
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers,

326
00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:47.594
and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys
out of Cottonelia, Mississippi.

327
00:23:47.677 --> 00:23:50.722
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

328
00:23:51.055 --> 00:23:54.434
We hear that you pay good money
to sing into a can.

329
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:57.562
Well, that all depends.
You boys do negro songs?

330
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.481
Uh...

331
00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:03.276
Well, sir, we are negroes,

332
00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:07.280
all except for our...
The fellow that plays the guitar.

333
00:24:07.488 --> 00:24:09.532
Well, I don't record nigger songs.

334
00:24:10.491 --> 00:24:13.453
No, I'm lookin' for
some old-timey material.

335
00:24:13.536 --> 00:24:15.872
People can't seem to get enough of it

336
00:24:15.955 --> 00:24:19.667
since we started broadcastin' it on
the Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.

337
00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:21.878
So, thank you for stoppin' by.

338
00:24:21.961 --> 00:24:24.088
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys

339
00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:27.008
have been steeped in old-timey material.

340
00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:29.010
Heck, we're silly with it, ain't we, boys?

341
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:30.637
- That's right.
- That's right.

342
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.057
- We ain't really negroes.
- All except for our accompanist.

343
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.354
/

344
00:24:39.437 --> 00:24:41.606
Am a man

345
00:24:41.689 --> 00:24:44.734
of constant sorrow

346
00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.403
I've seen trouble

347
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:49.572
all my days

348
00:24:51.074 --> 00:24:53.034
/

349
00:24:53.201 --> 00:24:55.620
Bid farewell

350
00:24:55.703 --> 00:24:58.414
to old Kentucky

351
00:24:58.498 --> 00:25:01.084
The place where I

352
00:25:01.167 --> 00:25:03.961
was born and raised

353
00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:06.798
The place where he

354
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:09.550
was born and raised

355
00:25:10.677 --> 00:25:12.679
For

356
00:25:12.762 --> 00:25:15.098
six long years

357
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:18.017
I've been in trouble

358
00:25:18.101 --> 00:25:20.770
No pleasure here

359
00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.980
on earth I found

360
00:25:24.607 --> 00:25:26.526
For

361
00:25:26.609 --> 00:25:28.986
in this world

362
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.197
I'm bound to ramble

363
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.659
I have no friends

364
00:25:34.742 --> 00:25:37.537
to help me now

365
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.248
He has no friends

366
00:25:40.331 --> 00:25:42.834
to help him now

367
00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:46.045
Maybe

368
00:25:46.129 --> 00:25:48.464
your friends think

369
00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:51.467
I'm just a stranger

370
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:55.304
My face you'll never see no more

371
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:02.979
But there is one promise

372
00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:05.523
that is given

373
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:08.192
I'll meet you on

374
00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:11.154
God's golden shore

375
00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:13.906
He'll meet you on

376
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.325
God's golden shore

377
00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:23.939
Hot damn, son! I believe you
did sell your soul to the devil!

378
00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:29.172
Boys, that was some mighty fine
pickin' and a-singin'.

379
00:26:29.547 --> 00:26:31.007
I tell you what.

380
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.178
You come on in here,
and you sign these papers here,

381
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:38.055
I'm gonna give ya $10 apiece.

382
00:26:40.183 --> 00:26:44.771
Okay, sir, but Mert and Aloysius
will have to just sign "X's".

383
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:46.856
Only four of us can write.

384
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.441
That'll be fine.

385
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:55.406
Hey, mister, I don't mean to be
tellin' tales out of school,

386
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.825
but there's a feller in
there who'll pay you $10

387
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:59.619
if you sing into his can.

388
00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:02.413
I'm not here to make a record,
ya dumb cracker.

389
00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:04.874
They broadcast me out on the radio.

390
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:08.669
That's Governor Menelaus
"Pass the Biscuits, Pappy" O'Daniel.

391
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:12.590
And he'd sure appreciate it if you ate
his farina and voted him a second term.

392
00:27:12.673 --> 00:27:14.592
Finest governor we ever had in Mississippi.

393
00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:16.069
In any state.
Lord, yes.

394
00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:18.930
- Every parish or precinct.
He was makin' the bigger point.

395
00:27:19.013 --> 00:27:21.808
Ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy?
Do a little politickin'?

396
00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:24.101
I'll press your flesh,
you dimwitted sumbitch.

397
00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:26.646
You don't tell your pappy
how to court the electorate!

398
00:27:26.729 --> 00:27:30.191
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here.
We're mass communicatin'!

399
00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:33.152
Oh, yes. That's
a powerful new force.

400
00:27:33.236 --> 00:27:36.864
Shake a leg, Junior.
Thank God your mama died givin' birth.

401
00:27:36.948 --> 00:27:39.158
If she'd a-seen ya, she'd a-died of shame.

402
00:27:39.242 --> 00:27:40.827
Hi, there. How you doin'?

403
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:46.332
Oh, damn you, Lily

404
00:27:46.415 --> 00:27:49.085
Where you goin'?

405
00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:52.797
Ain't it harder
than it's ever been before

406
00:28:00.012 --> 00:28:02.807
And the people are drifting

407
00:28:03.432 --> 00:28:05.434
Door to door

408
00:28:05.852 --> 00:28:09.897
Can't find no heaven
I don't care where they go

409
00:28:21.868 --> 00:28:24.036
Said you had money

410
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:26.581
You better be sure

411
00:28:26.956 --> 00:28:31.335
These hard times will drive you
from door to door

412
00:28:43.806 --> 00:28:45.892
Let's bed down here for the night.

413
00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:49.645
Yeah. It stinks in that old barn.

414
00:28:50.396 --> 00:28:51.939
Suits me.

415
00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.567
Pretty soon, it'll be nothin'

416
00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.486
but feather beds and silk sheets.

417
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:02.408
$1 million.

418
00:29:02.992 --> 00:29:04.493
$1.2 million.

419
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:08.080
$500,000 each.

420
00:29:08.289 --> 00:29:09.707
$400,000, Delmar.

421
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:15.504
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure?

422
00:29:17.298 --> 00:29:19.508
Go out west somewhere,

423
00:29:19.926 --> 00:29:22.053
open a fine restaurant.

424
00:29:23.763 --> 00:29:25.723
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

425
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.268
Greet all the swells,

426
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:34.732
go to work everyday in a bow tie, tuxedo.

427
00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:41.405
And all the staff'll say,
"Yes, sir", and "No, sir"

428
00:29:41.489 --> 00:29:43.407
and "In a jiffy, Pete."

429
00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:47.370
And all my meals for free.

430
00:29:52.208 --> 00:29:53.376
What about you, Delmar?

431
00:29:54.001 --> 00:29:56.754
What are you gonna do
with your share of that dough?

432
00:29:57.797 --> 00:30:01.467
Gonna visit them foreclosin' son of a guns

433
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:04.679
down at the Indianola Savings and Loan,

434
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:07.682
slap that money on the barrelhead

435
00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:09.976
and buy back the family farm.

436
00:30:11.852 --> 00:30:15.231
You ain't no kind of man
if you ain't got land.

437
00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:18.401
What about you, Everett?

438
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.071
What'd you have in mind
when you stole it in the first place?

439
00:30:23.406 --> 00:30:24.407
Uh...

440
00:30:26.575 --> 00:30:28.744
I didn't have no plan.

441
00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:31.664
Well, that hardly sounds like you.

442
00:30:32.581 --> 00:30:35.626
All right, boys,
it's the authorities!

443
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.546
Your situation is purt nigh hopeless!

444
00:30:38.629 --> 00:30:41.048
- Damn! They found our car!

445
00:30:41.132 --> 00:30:43.050
We ain't got the time

446
00:30:43.134 --> 00:30:47.179
and nary inclination
to gentle you boys any further!

447
00:30:47.263 --> 00:30:49.557
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!

448
00:30:50.558 --> 00:30:54.020
I left my pomade in the car.
Maybe I can creep up.

449
00:30:54.103 --> 00:30:55.896
Don't be a fool, Everett.

450
00:30:56.147 --> 00:30:58.315
We gotta R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

451
00:30:59.817 --> 00:31:01.777
Where's Tommy?
- Already lit out.

452
00:31:02.278 --> 00:31:04.113
He's scared out of his wits.

453
00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:08.325
Let's go!

454
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:12.163
The hell it ain't square one.

455
00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:16.625
Ain't no one gonna pick up
three filthy, unshaved hitchhikers,

456
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:20.337
and one of 'em a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

457
00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:23.049
Pete, the personal rancour
reflected in that remark,

458
00:31:23.132 --> 00:31:25.468
I don't intend to dignify with comment.

459
00:31:25.551 --> 00:31:27.762
But I would like to address
your general attitude

460
00:31:27.845 --> 00:31:29.263
of hopeless negativism.

461
00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:32.475
Consider the lilies of the goddamn field.

462
00:31:32.975 --> 00:31:35.728
Or hell, take a look at Delmar here
as your paradigm of hope.

463
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.980
Yeah, look at me.

464
00:31:38.064 --> 00:31:40.566
Now, you may call it
an unreasoning optimism.

465
00:31:40.649 --> 00:31:43.486
You may call it obtuse,
but the plain and simple fact is

466
00:31:43.569 --> 00:31:47.323
that we got close to three days before they

467
00:31:53.037 --> 00:31:54.622
dam that river.

468
00:32:19.605 --> 00:32:21.190
Is this the road to Itta Bena?

469
00:32:23.359 --> 00:32:24.360
Uh...

470
00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:26.862
Itta Bena?

471
00:32:28.114 --> 00:32:31.617
- Isn't it...
Stay on this road...

472
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.370
No, that ain't
right. I was thinkin' of...

473
00:32:34.453 --> 00:32:36.914
- Take this road...
- No, that ain't right.

474
00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.333
It seems to me there's a road,

475
00:32:39.416 --> 00:32:42.294
a cow road that used to lead all the way,

476
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:45.131
well, most of the way to...

477
00:32:45.214 --> 00:32:47.883
- That ain't right either.
- Hop on in while you give it a think.

478
00:32:49.552 --> 00:32:50.553
Delmar.

479
00:32:59.645 --> 00:33:03.315
Any of you boys know your way
around a Walther PPK?

480
00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:05.401
Well, see, that's where we can't help ya.

481
00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:07.194
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

482
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.825
Friend, some of your foldin' money
has come unstowed.

483
00:33:12.908 --> 00:33:15.828
Just stuff it
down that sack there, will ya?

484
00:33:15.911 --> 00:33:18.164
You boys aren't bad men, I take it?

485
00:33:18.247 --> 00:33:20.666
Well, it's funny you should ask.

486
00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:24.920
I was bad till yesterday,
but me and Pete here been saved.

487
00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:28.007
I'm Delmar, and that there's Everett.

488
00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.843
George Nelson. It's a pleasure.

489
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:34.430
Grab the tiller, will ya, buddy?

490
00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:42.688
Hand me that chopper.

491
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.900
Say, what line of work are you in, George?

492
00:33:48.444 --> 00:33:50.029
Come and get me, coppers!

493
00:33:50.446 --> 00:33:54.408
You flat-footed, lame brained,
soft-assed sons of bitches!

494
00:33:56.202 --> 00:33:59.371
No one can catch me! I'm George Nelson!

495
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:02.291
I'm bigger than any John Law ever lived!

496
00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:08.380
I'm 10 and a half feet tall
and ain't yet full growed!

497
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.091
Cows.

498
00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:14.136
I hate cows worse than coppers!

499
00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.308
Oh, George, not the livestock.

500
00:34:19.892 --> 00:34:24.271
Come on, you miserable, salaried
sons of bitches! Come and get me!

501
00:34:41.497 --> 00:34:44.875
Come on, boys. We're goin' for the record.
Three banks in two hours.

502
00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:56.011
Okay, folks, hold the applause
and drop yer drawers!

503
00:34:56.095 --> 00:35:00.015
I'm George Nelson, and I'm
here to sack the city of Itta Benal!

504
00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:03.269
He's a live wire though, ain't he?

505
00:35:03.352 --> 00:35:06.522
All the money in a bag!
What are you lookin' at, grandpa?

506
00:35:07.398 --> 00:35:10.025
Pardon me, George.
You got a plan for gettin' out of here?

507
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:11.527
Sure, boys.

508
00:35:12.528 --> 00:35:13.988
Here's my plan.

509
00:35:15.197 --> 00:35:17.950
They ain't never seen ordnance like this.

510
00:35:18.033 --> 00:35:20.494
Thank you, folks. And remember,

511
00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:24.081
Jesus saves, but George Nelson withdraws.

512
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.750
Go fetch the autovoiture, Pete.

513
00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:29.211
That's Babyface Nelson.

514
00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:31.380
Who said that?

515
00:35:33.549 --> 00:35:36.176
What ignorant, lowdown,

516
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.138
slanderizing son of a bitch said that?

517
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.809
My name is George Nelson!

518
00:35:43.892 --> 00:35:45.144
- Get me?
- Mmm-hmm.

519
00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.647
She didn't mean nothin' by it, George.

520
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:52.985
George Nelson, not Babyface!

521
00:35:53.652 --> 00:35:56.572
You remember, and you tell your friends!

522
00:35:57.573 --> 00:36:00.909
I'm George Nelson, born to raise hell!

523
00:36:20.054 --> 00:36:22.931
Well, that was some fun though,
wasn't it, George?

524
00:36:23.307 --> 00:36:24.350
Yeah.

525
00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:27.227
Almost makes me wish I hadn't been saved.

526
00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:29.063
Jackin' up banks...

527
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:30.356
I can see how a fella

528
00:36:30.439 --> 00:36:33.859
could derive a whole lot of pleasure
and satisfaction out of it.

529
00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:37.821
- It's okay.
Hoo, doggies!

530
00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:43.702
Well,

531
00:36:45.954 --> 00:36:47.498
I'm takin' off.

532
00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:53.462
You boys might as well

533
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:57.174
keep my share of the riches.

534
00:36:59.510 --> 00:37:01.470
Well, where are you goin', George?

535
00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:06.100
I don't know. Who cares?

536
00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:11.939
Now, what do you suppose is eatin' George?

537
00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:15.484
Well, Delmar, they say that

538
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.987
with a thrill-seekin' personality,
what goes up must come down.

539
00:37:19.363 --> 00:37:22.324
Top of the world one minute,
haunted by megrims the next.

540
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:27.496
Yes, sir, it's as if our old friend
George is an alley cat,

541
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.332
and his own damn humour's
swingin' him by the tail.

542
00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:34.294
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.
He'll be back on top again.

543
00:37:35.087 --> 00:37:38.799
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

544
00:37:59.069 --> 00:38:01.530
Don't be saps for Pappy.

545
00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:04.241
Homer Stokes for governor.

546
00:38:04.324 --> 00:38:06.535
Let's sweep this state clean.

547
00:38:07.035 --> 00:38:08.954
Vote for Stokes, bubba.

548
00:38:22.926 --> 00:38:26.346
Shh. Hang on. I'm gonna slap one on here.

549
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:31.059
Folks, here's my cousin Ezzard's niece,
Eudora, from out of Greenwood,

550
00:38:31.143 --> 00:38:34.438
doin' a little number
with her cousin Tom-Tom,

551
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:38.066
which I predict you gonna enjoy thoroughly.

552
00:38:42.029 --> 00:38:46.283
Now, what can I do you for, Mr French?

553
00:38:46.575 --> 00:38:49.620
How can I lay a hold of them
Soggy Bottom Boys?

554
00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:53.332
Soggy Bottom.
I don't precisely recollect them.

555
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.709
They cut a record in here a few days ago.

556
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:59.546
It was an old-timey harmony thing
with a guitar...

557
00:38:59.713 --> 00:39:03.008
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember them!

558
00:39:03.717 --> 00:39:05.236
- Coloured fellas, I believe.
- Uh-huh.

559
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.222
Yes, sir, they're a fine bunch of boys.

560
00:39:08.305 --> 00:39:11.391
They sang into yonder can and skedaddled.

561
00:39:11.475 --> 00:39:15.354
That record is just goin' through
the goddamn roof.

562
00:39:15.437 --> 00:39:18.023
They're playin' it as far away as Mobile.

563
00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.025
Whole damn state's goin' ape.

564
00:39:20.943 --> 00:39:23.195
Well, it was a powerful air.

565
00:39:23.695 --> 00:39:27.449
Hot damn, we gotta find them boys
and sign 'em to a big, fat contract.

566
00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:31.495
Hells bells, Mr Lunn. If we don't,
the goddamn competition will.

567
00:39:31.578 --> 00:39:34.957
Oh, mercy, yes.
We got to beat that competition.

568
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.458
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

569
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:19.728
Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys
performing Man of Constant Sorrow?

570
00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:22.522
No, ma'am.
We got a new shipment in yesterday.

571
00:41:22.606 --> 00:41:24.900
Sorry, but we just
can't keep it on our shelves.

572
00:42:45.647 --> 00:42:47.274
Shut up, Delmar.

573
00:42:56.158 --> 00:42:58.618
Pull over! Pull over!

574
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.003
I guess ol' Pete's got the itch.

575
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.426
Go to sleep, you little baby

576
00:43:15.635 --> 00:43:19.181
Go to sleep, you little baby

577
00:43:19.264 --> 00:43:23.101
Your mama's gone away
and your daddy's gone to stay

578
00:43:23.185 --> 00:43:25.228
Didn't leave nobody

579
00:43:25.312 --> 00:43:28.732
But the baby

580
00:43:30.525 --> 00:43:33.320
Howdy do, ladies. Name of Pete.

581
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.949
Go to sleep, you little baby

582
00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:41.661
Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn

583
00:43:41.745 --> 00:43:43.830
Didn't leave nobody

584
00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:47.000
but the baby

585
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:49.711
- Ain't you gonna introduce us, Pete?
- I don't know their names.

586
00:43:49.795 --> 00:43:51.213
I seen 'em first!

587
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:56.009
You sweet, little baby

588
00:43:56.384 --> 00:44:00.472
Honey in the rock
and the sugar don't stop

589
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:06.102
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

590
00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:10.482
Don't you weep, pretty baby

591
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:14.778
Don't you weep, pretty baby

592
00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:19.449
She's long gone
with her red shoes on

593
00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:24.996
Gonna meet another lovin' baby

594
00:44:27.415 --> 00:44:31.169
Ladies, my name is Ulysses Everett McGill.

595
00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:35.423
Well, you three ladies
are about the prettiest...

596
00:44:35.507 --> 00:44:38.510
You and me
and the devil makes three

597
00:44:38.593 --> 00:44:43.932
Don't need no other lovin' baby

598
00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:48.436
water lilies I've ever...

599
00:44:49.354 --> 00:44:50.355
Corn liquor.

600
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:53.942
Go to sleep, you little baby

601
00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:57.863
You and me
and the devil makes three

602
00:44:57.946 --> 00:45:03.368
Don't need no other lovin' baby

603
00:45:04.286 --> 00:45:08.915
Go to sleep, you little baby

604
00:45:08.999 --> 00:45:12.502
Go to sleep, you little baby

605
00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:16.423
Your mama's gone away
and your daddy's gone to stay

606
00:45:16.506 --> 00:45:22.262
Didn't leave nobody but the baby

607
00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:26.349
Go to sleep, you little baby

608
00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:30.270
Go to sleep, you little baby

609
00:45:31.605 --> 00:45:35.567
Come, lay your bones
on the alabaster stones

610
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:41.364
And be my ever-lovin' baby

611
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.741
Everett.

612
00:46:26.868 --> 00:46:27.869
Everett!

613
00:46:27.953 --> 00:46:29.371
My hair!

614
00:46:31.289 --> 00:46:32.707
Look at this.

615
00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:50.308
Pete, where the heck are ya?

616
00:46:51.059 --> 00:46:52.060
Pete!

617
00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:55.522
We ain't got time for hide-and-seek!

618
00:46:58.358 --> 00:47:00.652
We ain't got time for your shenanigans!

619
00:47:00.735 --> 00:47:02.570
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

620
00:47:04.072 --> 00:47:05.991
They left his heart.

621
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:32.642
Delmar, what the heck's got into you?

622
00:47:32.726 --> 00:47:34.102
Can't you see it, Everett?

623
00:47:35.145 --> 00:47:38.064
Them sirens did this to Pete.

624
00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:41.901
They loved him up
and turned him into a horny toad.

625
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:50.702
Pele! Pele!

626
00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:53.038
Pele! Pele!

627
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:56.916
Pele! Pele!

628
00:47:58.293 --> 00:47:59.335
Pete!

629
00:48:06.885 --> 00:48:10.638
Pete, it's me, Delmar.

630
00:48:11.514 --> 00:48:14.017
It's me, Delmar.

631
00:48:15.185 --> 00:48:16.186
Everett.

632
00:48:19.147 --> 00:48:20.565
What are we gonna do?

633
00:48:32.118 --> 00:48:35.121
- I'm not sure that's Pete.
- Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

634
00:48:36.706 --> 00:48:41.002
We gotta find some kind of wizard
can change him back.

635
00:48:45.006 --> 00:48:47.217
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

636
00:48:50.887 --> 00:48:53.598
You can't display a toad
in a fine restaurant like this.

637
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:56.309
Why, the good folks here
would go right off their feed.

638
00:48:57.685 --> 00:49:01.439
I just don't think it's right keepin' him
under wraps like we's ashamed of him.

639
00:49:01.523 --> 00:49:03.691
Well, if it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

640
00:49:03.858 --> 00:49:05.652
The way I see it, he got what he deserved,

641
00:49:05.735 --> 00:49:08.363
fornicatin' with some whore of Babylon.

642
00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:10.406
These things don't happen
for no reason, Delmar.

643
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:12.784
It's obviously some kind of judgement
on Pete's character.

644
00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:15.662
Well, the two of us
was fixin' to fornicate.

645
00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:20.834
You're gonna have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

646
00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:23.711
unaccustomed as he is to city manners.

647
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:27.799
I guess we'll have ourselves

648
00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:30.969
a couple of steaks
and some gratineed potatoes,

649
00:49:31.052 --> 00:49:33.092
and we'll wash it down with
your finest bubbly wine.

650
00:49:33.638 --> 00:49:36.099
And I don't suppose you have

651
00:49:36.182 --> 00:49:38.059
any nits or grubs back there.

652
00:49:41.771 --> 00:49:44.607
No, just bring us a couple leaves
of raw cabbage.

653
00:49:44.691 --> 00:49:47.610
- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you. That kind of barnyard...

654
00:49:47.694 --> 00:49:49.672
I don't believe I've seen
you boys around here before.

655
00:49:49.696 --> 00:49:52.740
Allow me to introduce myself.
Name of Daniel Teague.

656
00:49:52.824 --> 00:49:55.201
Known in these precincts as Big Dan Teague,

657
00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:58.746
or to those who are pressed for time,
Big Dan toot cort.

658
00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:01.166
How you doin', Big Dan?
My name's Ulysses Everett McGill.

659
00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:03.293
This is my associate, Delmar O'Donnell.

660
00:50:03.585 --> 00:50:06.754
I detect, like me,
you are endowed with the gift of gab.

661
00:50:06.838 --> 00:50:08.756
I flatter myself that such is the case.

662
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:10.884
In my line of work, it's plumb necessary.

663
00:50:10.967 --> 00:50:13.136
The one thing you don't want

664
00:50:14.888 --> 00:50:16.723
is air in the conversation.

665
00:50:17.265 --> 00:50:19.350
Once again, we find ourselves in agreement.

666
00:50:19.434 --> 00:50:22.187
- What kind of work you do, Big Dan?
- Sales, Mr McGill, sales.

667
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:25.481
And what do I sell?
The truth, every blessed word of it,

668
00:50:25.565 --> 00:50:27.984
from Genesis on down to Revelations.

669
00:50:28.067 --> 00:50:30.653
That's right, the word of God,
which, let me tell you,

670
00:50:30.737 --> 00:50:34.741
there is damn good money in
during these times of woe and want.

671
00:50:34.866 --> 00:50:36.451
People are lookin' for answers,

672
00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:39.704
and Big Dan sells
the only book that's got 'em.

673
00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:43.917
And what do you do,
you and your tongue-tied friend?

674
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:45.293
We...

675
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:48.296
We're adventurers, sir,

676
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.383
currently pursuin' a certain opportunity,
but we're open to others as well.

677
00:50:52.467 --> 00:50:55.720
I like your style, young man,
so I'm gonna propose you a proposition.

678
00:50:55.803 --> 00:50:58.223
You cover my bill so I don't have
to run back upstairs,

679
00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:00.433
get your waitress to wrap
your dinner picnic style,

680
00:51:00.516 --> 00:51:03.603
and we shall retire to
more private environs,

681
00:51:03.686 --> 00:51:06.397
where I will tell you how
there are vast amounts of money

682
00:51:06.481 --> 00:51:08.733
to be made in the service of God Almighty.

683
00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:12.779
Why not? Nothin' else,
I could use some civilised conversation.

684
00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:16.074
- Don't forget your shoe box, friend.
- Languishin'!

685
00:51:16.157 --> 00:51:18.660
Goddamn campaign is languishin'!

686
00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:21.246
We need a shot in the arm.
Ya hear me, boys?

687
00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:23.039
In the goddamn arm!

688
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:26.751
Election held tomorrow, that
sumbitch Stokes would win it in a walk!

689
00:51:26.834 --> 00:51:30.338
Well, he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

690
00:51:30.797 --> 00:51:34.300
- Yeah?
- People like that reform.

691
00:51:35.009 --> 00:51:36.427
Maybe we should get us some.

692
00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:39.597
I'll reform you, you soft-headed sumbitch!

693
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:42.267
How are we gonna run reform
when we're the damn incumbent?

694
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:46.271
Is that the best idea
you boys can come up with? Reform?

695
00:51:46.354 --> 00:51:49.732
Weepin' Jesus on the cross. Eckard!

696
00:51:50.024 --> 00:51:53.695
You may as well start draftin'
my concession speech right now.

697
00:51:54.028 --> 00:51:55.196
Okay, Pappy.

698
00:51:55.488 --> 00:51:57.949
I'm just makin' a point,
you stupid sumbitch!

699
00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:00.118
Give me back that hat! Hurry up!

700
00:52:00.201 --> 00:52:02.370
- Pappy's just makin' a point.
- Shut up!

701
00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.699
Thank you, boys,
for throwin' in that fricassee.

702
00:52:21.723 --> 00:52:24.434
I'm a man of large appetite,
and even with lunch under my belt,

703
00:52:24.517 --> 00:52:26.060
I was feelin' a might peckish.

704
00:52:26.394 --> 00:52:27.478
Our pleasure, Big Dan.

705
00:52:28.604 --> 00:52:31.232
Thank you as well
for the conversational hiatus.

706
00:52:31.482 --> 00:52:34.360
I generally refrain from speech
during gustation.

707
00:52:34.444 --> 00:52:36.988
There are those who attempt both
at the same time.

708
00:52:38.406 --> 00:52:41.200
I find it coarse and vulgar. Where were we?

709
00:52:41.284 --> 00:52:42.994
Makin' money in the Lord's service.

710
00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:44.972
You don't say much, friend,
but when you do,

711
00:52:44.996 --> 00:52:46.914
it's to the point, and I salute you for it.

712
00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:48.583
Yes, Bible sales.

713
00:52:49.208 --> 00:52:52.837
Now, the trade is not a complicated one.
There are but two things to learn.

714
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.133
One being where to find the wholesaler,
the word of God in bulk, as it were.

715
00:52:57.216 --> 00:53:01.012
Two, how to recognise your customer.
Who are you dealin' with?

716
00:53:01.262 --> 00:53:04.599
It's an exercise in
psychology, so to speak.

717
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:07.769
And it is that which I propose

718
00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:09.771
to give you a lesson in

719
00:53:09.979 --> 00:53:10.980
right now.

720
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:16.361
Why, I like to think I'm a pretty astute
observer of the human scene, too, Big Dan.

721
00:53:16.444 --> 00:53:19.655
No doubt, brother.
I figured as much back at the restaurant.

722
00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:24.660
That's why I invited y'all out here
for this advanced tutorial.

723
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.516
- What's goin' on, Big Dan?
- It's all about the money, boys!

724
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.250
That's the answer!

725
00:53:31.626 --> 00:53:33.002
Dough,

726
00:53:33.086 --> 00:53:34.128
re,

727
00:53:34.462 --> 00:53:35.463
mil

728
00:53:36.339 --> 00:53:38.633
- I don't get it, Big Dan.

729
00:53:40.635 --> 00:53:42.804
I'll just take your show cards

730
00:53:53.106 --> 00:53:55.274
And whatever you got in the hole.

731
00:53:59.779 --> 00:54:00.780
What the...

732
00:54:02.115 --> 00:54:03.699
It ain't nothin' but a damn toad.

733
00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.994
No, you don't understand.

734
00:54:07.453 --> 00:54:08.996
That's Pete.

735
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.963
You know these things give you warts?

736
00:54:26.055 --> 00:54:27.098
End of the lesson.

737
00:54:29.767 --> 00:54:30.768
So long, boys.

738
00:54:32.478 --> 00:54:34.230
See ya in the funny papers.

739
00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:37.358
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

740
00:55:00.506 --> 00:55:02.133
Where are they?

741
00:55:02.633 --> 00:55:06.095
Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a whore!

742
00:55:06.554 --> 00:55:08.181
Where they headed?

743
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.893
Your screams ain't gonna save your flesh.

744
00:55:12.477 --> 00:55:14.645
Only your tongue is, boy.

745
00:55:14.729 --> 00:55:16.314
Where they headed?

746
00:55:29.577 --> 00:55:30.912
Lump, 1.O.

747
00:55:38.961 --> 00:55:41.339
Sweet summer rain.

748
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.802
Like God's own mercy.

749
00:55:48.596 --> 00:55:50.973
Your two friends have abandoned you, Pete.

750
00:55:51.807 --> 00:55:54.519
They don't seem to care about your hide.

751
00:55:59.815 --> 00:56:00.900
Okay.

752
00:56:06.364 --> 00:56:08.950
Stairway to heaven, Pete.

753
00:56:12.245 --> 00:56:13.829
We shall all meet, by and by.

754
00:56:14.455 --> 00:56:16.749
God damn it!

755
00:56:18.918 --> 00:56:20.336
God, forgive me!

756
00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:37.895
Believe me, he would've wanted us
to press on.

757
00:56:38.104 --> 00:56:40.147
Pete, rest his soul,

758
00:56:40.815 --> 00:56:42.733
was one sour-assed son of a bitch
and not given

759
00:56:42.817 --> 00:56:45.403
to acts of pointless sentimentality.

760
00:56:45.653 --> 00:56:48.614
It just don't seem right
diggin' up that treasure without him.

761
00:56:48.906 --> 00:56:50.866
Maybe it's for the best he was squished.

762
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.118
Why,

763
00:56:53.077 --> 00:56:55.746
- he was barely a sentient bein'.

764
00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:59.458
As soon as we get ourselves cleaned up
and get a little smell'um in our hair,

765
00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:03.004
we're gonna feel 100% better
about ourselves and about

766
00:57:04.046 --> 00:57:05.673
life in general.

767
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:09.385
Must be near Parchman Farm.

768
00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:12.680
Sorry sons of bitches.

769
00:57:13.848 --> 00:57:15.933
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

770
00:57:26.235 --> 00:57:27.486
Pete got a brother?

771
00:57:28.654 --> 00:57:29.989
Not that I'm aware.

772
00:57:34.035 --> 00:57:35.369
Heat must be gettin' to me.

773
00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:48.466
Oh, the storm
and its furies rage today

774
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:52.887
Crushing hope that we cherish so dear

775
00:57:53.095 --> 00:57:58.517
The cloud and storm
will, in time, pass away

776
00:57:58.601 --> 00:58:03.105
And the sun again will
shine bright and clear

777
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.734
Keep on the sunny side

778
00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.320
Always on the sunny side

779
00:58:09.403 --> 00:58:13.574
Keep on the sunny side of life

780
00:58:13.658 --> 00:58:16.118
It will help us everyday

781
00:58:16.202 --> 00:58:18.537
It will brighten all the way

782
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:23.459
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

783
00:58:23.542 --> 00:58:28.589
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

784
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:32.093
That was wonderful.

785
00:58:34.595 --> 00:58:37.515
Now, I know the Sunnysiders
would agree with me

786
00:58:37.598 --> 00:58:40.309
when I say that the
great state of Mississippi

787
00:58:40.393 --> 00:58:44.271
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel,

788
00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:47.233
four more years of cronyism,

789
00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:50.611
nepotism, rascalism

790
00:58:50.695 --> 00:58:52.530
and service to the interests.

791
00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:57.785
Now, the choice, she's a clear 'un.

792
00:58:58.077 --> 00:59:02.123
You have Pappy O'Daniel,
slave of the interests,

793
00:59:02.206 --> 00:59:05.376
Homer Stokes, servant of the little man.

794
00:59:05.459 --> 00:59:07.837
- Ain't that right, little fella?
- He ain't yin'!

795
00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.049
And, ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

796
00:59:12.133 --> 00:59:14.510
to grasp the broom of reform

797
00:59:14.593 --> 00:59:17.263
and sweep this state clean!

798
00:59:17.805 --> 00:59:21.225
It's gonna be back to
the flour mill, Pappy!

799
00:59:21.308 --> 00:59:23.394
The interests can take care of theirselves.

800
00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:25.062
Come Tuesday,

801
00:59:25.146 --> 00:59:27.606
we gon' sweep the rascals out.

802
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.987
Clean government is yours for the askin'.

803
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.659
Folks, now the little Wharvey gals.

804
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:41.662
Wharvey gals?

805
00:59:42.121 --> 00:59:44.081
Did he just say "little Wharvey gals"?

806
00:59:45.583 --> 00:59:47.251
Come here, girls.

807
00:59:47.334 --> 00:59:50.671
- What y'all gonna sing for us?
- In The Highways.

808
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.383
- God damn it all.
- You know them gals, Everett?

809
00:59:54.467 --> 00:59:58.012
In the highways, in the hedges

810
00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:02.141
In the highways, in the hedges

811
01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:06.604
In the highways, in the hedges

812
01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:10.775
I'll be somewhere a-workin' for my Lord

813
01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:15.112
I'll be somewhere a-workin'
I'll be somewhere a-workin'

814
01:00:15.196 --> 01:00:19.450
I'll be somewhere a-workin' for my Lord

815
01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:23.704
I'll be somewhere a-workin'
I'll be somewhere a-workin'

816
01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:27.958
I'll be somewhere a-workin' for my Lord

817
01:00:30.294 --> 01:00:33.798
- Hey, girls.
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

818
01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.719
Daddy? He ain't our daddy.

819
01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:41.514
The hell I ain't. What's this Wharvey gals?
Your name's McGill.

820
01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:44.099
No, sir, not since you
got hit by that train.

821
01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.369
What are you talking about?
I wasn't hit by any train.

822
01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.771
- Mama says you was hit by a train.
- Bloomey!

823
01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:49.855
Nothing left.

824
01:00:49.939 --> 01:00:52.191
Just a grease spot on the L&N.

825
01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.485
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train.

826
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:56.946
That's right.
Now, Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

827
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:58.447
That's her maiden name.

828
01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.157
You got a maiden name, Daddy?

829
01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:03.452
- No, Daddy don't have a maiden
name. See... That's your misfortune.

830
01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:06.288
That's right,
and now Mama's got a new beau.

831
01:01:06.372 --> 01:01:07.832
He's a suitor.

832
01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:09.834
Yeah, I heard about that.

833
01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:12.419
Mama says that he's bona fide.

834
01:01:13.546 --> 01:01:17.466
- Hmm. He give her a ring?
- Yes, sir. A big 'un.

835
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:19.802
Got a gem.
Mama checked it.

836
01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.137
- It's bona fide.
- He's a suitor.

837
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:23.222
What's his name?

838
01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:25.850
- Vernon T. Waldrip.
- Uncle Vernon.

839
01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:29.103
- Till tomorrow.
- Then he's gonna be Daddy.

840
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.606
I am the only daddy you got.
I am the damn paterfamilias.

841
01:01:32.815 --> 01:01:34.608
But you ain't bona fide.

842
01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.655
Where's your mama?

843
01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:42.449
- She's at the five and dime.
- Bu yin' nipples.

844
01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.954
Angels wait

845
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:50.624
to take me home

846
01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:55.337
Kiss me, Mother

847
01:01:59.592 --> 01:02:01.886
- Daddy!
- Hello, sugar!

848
01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.097
How's my little girl?

849
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.768
- Who the hell's that?
- Starla Wharvey.

850
01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:12.229
Starla McGill, you mean.

851
01:02:12.313 --> 01:02:15.125
- How come you never told me about her?
- 'Cause you was hit by a train.

852
01:02:15.149 --> 01:02:18.193
That's another thing. Why are you tellin'
our gals I was hit by a train?

853
01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:20.362
Lots of respectable
people been hit by trains.

854
01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:23.198
Judge Hobby over in Cookeville
was hit by a train.

855
01:02:23.282 --> 01:02:24.551
What was I supposed to tell 'em?

856
01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:27.703
That you were sent to the penal farm,
and I divorced you from shame?

857
01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:31.040
I take your point, but it does put me
in a damned awkward position,

858
01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:32.583
vis-a-vis my progeny.

859
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.667
Hello, Penny.

860
01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:37.421
This gentleman botherin' you?

861
01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.216
You Waldrip?

862
01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:43.636
Uh-huh. That's right.

863
01:02:57.983 --> 01:02:59.902
You been using my hair treatment?

864
01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:02.071
Your hair treatment?

865
01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.364
Excuse me.

866
01:03:07.201 --> 01:03:11.330
I got news for you. In case you hadn't
noticed, I wasn't hit by a train.

867
01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:14.541
And I have travelled many a weary mile

868
01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:17.086
to be back with my wife

869
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.796
and my six daughters.

870
01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.965
Seven, Daddy!

871
01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:23.801
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle.
Your daddy was hit by a train.

872
01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.303
- Penny, you stop that.
- No, you stop it.

873
01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:28.973
Vernon here's got a job.
Vernon's got prospects.

874
01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.975
He's bona fide. What are you?

875
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:34.687
I'll tell you what I am.
I'm the paterfamilias.

876
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:39.024
- You can't marry him.
- I can, I am and I will. Tomorrow.

877
01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:42.778
I gotta think about the little Wharvey
gals. They look to me for answers.

878
01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:45.698
Vernon can support 'em
and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet.

879
01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:48.704
The only good thing you ever did
for the gals was get hit by that train.

880
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:54.331
Why, you lyin' unconstant succubus.

881
01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:56.083
Whoa, whoa, whoal!

882
01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.502
You can't swear at my fiancée.

883
01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.670
Oh, yeah?

884
01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.464
Well, you can't marry my wife.

885
01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:26.947
Who is that man?

886
01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.242
He's not my husband.

887
01:04:31.118 --> 01:04:32.786
Just a drifter, I guess.

888
01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.830
Just some no account drifter.

889
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.754
And stay out of the Woolworths.

890
01:04:47.593 --> 01:04:49.845
I'll bet she does imitations, too.

891
01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:53.140
Deceitful, two-faced she-woman.

892
01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.435
Never trust a female, Delmar.

893
01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:57.853
Remember that one simple precept

894
01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:00.564
and your time with me
will not have been ill-spent.

895
01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:01.982
Okay, Everett.

896
01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:03.567
Hit by a train.

897
01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:08.072
The truth means nothin' to a woman, Delmar.
Triumph of the subjective.

898
01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.199
You ever been with a woman?

899
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:11.533
Well, I...

900
01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:17.081
I gotta get the family farm back
before I can start thinkin' about that.

901
01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:18.832
That's right. If then.

902
01:05:19.333 --> 01:05:22.920
Believe me, Delmar, woman is the most
fiendish instrument of torture

903
01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:25.297
ever devised to bedevil the days of man.

904
01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:30.177
Everett, I never figured you
for a paterfamilias.

905
01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.263
Oh, yes. I have spread my seed.

906
01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:35.808
And look what it's...

907
01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.605
What the hell's...

908
01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:44.334
Okay, boys, enjoy your picture show.

909
01:06:50.799 --> 01:06:53.468
I have no money, honey.

910
01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:56.847
How can I change?

911
01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:00.851
Do not seek the treasure.

912
01:07:04.188 --> 01:07:08.775
Do not seek the treasure.

913
01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:12.404
It's a bushwhack.

914
01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:15.866
They're fixin' an ambush.

915
01:07:15.949 --> 01:07:19.703
Do not seek the treasure.

916
01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.295
We thought you was

917
01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:30.672
a toad.

918
01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:37.888
We thought

919
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.682
you was

920
01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:42.684
a toad!

921
01:07:44.645 --> 01:07:48.732
Do not seek the treasure!

922
01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:51.151
Quiet there! Watch the picture!

923
01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:01.954
I signed that bill.
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

924
01:08:02.246 --> 01:08:04.831
Everyone knows I'm a friend of the farmer.

925
01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:08.168
What I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?

926
01:08:08.252 --> 01:08:11.755
We can't do that, Daddy.
We might offend our constituency.

927
01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:13.840
We ain't got a constituency.

928
01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.634
Stokes got a constituency!

929
01:08:17.427 --> 01:08:20.013
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

930
01:08:20.097 --> 01:08:22.015
Midget and broom and whatnot.

931
01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:24.726
- Devil his due.
- Hell of an organisation.

932
01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:27.479
Say, I got an idea.

933
01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:28.682
What's that, Junior?

934
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.067
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

935
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.070
You slump-shouldered sack of guts!

936
01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:37.906
Why, we'd look like a bunch
of Johnny-Come-Latelys

937
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.908
braggin' on our own midget.

938
01:08:39.992 --> 01:08:41.660
Don't matter how stumpy.

939
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.707
That's the goddamn problem right there.
People think Stokes got fresh ideas.

940
01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.293
He's au courant, and we the past.

941
01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:51.503
- It's a problem of...
- Perception.

942
01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:52.671
That's right.

943
01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.440
The reason why he's pullin' our pants down.

944
01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.734
- Gonna paddle our little behinds.
- Ain't gon' paddle it.

945
01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.302
Gon' kick it real hard.

946
01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:00.345
No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.

947
01:09:00.429 --> 01:09:02.365
I don't believe
that's a proper description.

948
01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:04.766
Well, that's how I'd characterise it.

949
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:07.185
I believe
it's more of a kickin' situation.

950
01:09:26.747 --> 01:09:28.582
God, forgive me.

951
01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:32.794
I could not gaze upon that far shore.

952
01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:35.213
- Pete.

953
01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:37.883
Hold still!

954
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.927
Can't stand much longer.

955
01:09:42.721 --> 01:09:44.890
It was a moment of weakness.

956
01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:46.975
Quit your babblin', Pete.
We gotta skedaddle.

957
01:09:47.059 --> 01:09:48.935
That's all I got.

958
01:09:49.436 --> 01:09:51.480
They lured me out for a bathe,

959
01:09:51.563 --> 01:09:54.691
and then they dunked me,
and trussed me up like a hog

960
01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:56.651
and turned me in for the bounty.

961
01:09:56.735 --> 01:09:59.237
Should've guessed it.
Typical womanly behaviour.

962
01:09:59.321 --> 01:10:01.907
Just lucky we left
before they came back for us.

963
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:06.203
We didn't abandon you, Pete.
We just thought you was a toad.

964
01:10:06.286 --> 01:10:08.914
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

965
01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.208
Well, that was our mistake, then.

966
01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:16.713
And we was beat up by a Bible salesman
and banished from Woolworths.

967
01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:20.634
I don't know, Everett,
was it the one branch or all of 'em?

968
01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.720
Well, I ain't had it easy either, boys.

969
01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:26.056
Frankly...

970
01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.557
Well, I...

971
01:10:29.101 --> 01:10:31.645
I spilled my guts about the treasure.

972
01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:33.730
Huh?

973
01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:38.151
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you fellas.

974
01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.238
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

975
01:10:43.824 --> 01:10:45.826
That's all right, Pete.

976
01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:49.246
It's awful white of you
to take it like that, Everett.

977
01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.665
I feel wretched,

978
01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:55.127
spoilin' your play for $1.2 million.

979
01:10:56.086 --> 01:10:58.296
It's been eatin' out my guts.

980
01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.133
That's all right.

981
01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.512
You boys are true friends.

982
01:11:07.973 --> 01:11:10.517
You're my boon companions.

983
01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:15.439
Pete, I don't want you
to beat yourself up about this thing.

984
01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:20.944
I can't help it,
but that's a wonderful thing to say.

985
01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:27.534
Pete,

986
01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.165
the fact of the matter is,

987
01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:37.544
damn it,

988
01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:39.754
there ain't no treasure.

989
01:11:43.383 --> 01:11:45.385
Fact of the matter is, there never was.

990
01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:51.725
So, where's all the money
from the armoured car job?

991
01:11:53.435 --> 01:11:56.062
I never knocked over no armoured car.

992
01:11:57.147 --> 01:11:59.608
I was sent up for practisin' law
without a licence.

993
01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.234
But...

994
01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:03.069
Damn it, I had to bust out.

995
01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:05.739
My wife wrote me she was gettin' married,
I gotta stop it.

996
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.577
I had two weeks left on my sentence.

997
01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:13.317
I couldn't wait two weeks.
She's gettin' married tomorrow.

998
01:12:13.413 --> 01:12:16.374
With my added time for the escape,

999
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:21.296
I don't get out now until 1987.

1000
01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:23.256
Now, I am sorry about that.

1001
01:12:23.924 --> 01:12:25.383
I'll be

1002
01:12:26.218 --> 01:12:28.136
84 years old.

1003
01:12:29.471 --> 01:12:33.058
I guess they'll tack on
50 years for me, too.

1004
01:12:33.308 --> 01:12:36.353
Boys, we was chained together.

1005
01:12:36.436 --> 01:12:40.023
I had to tell you somethin'.
Bustin' out alone was not an option.

1006
01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:42.651
I'm sorry.

1007
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.529
Eighty-four years old.

1008
01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:49.282
Well, I'll only be 82.

1009
01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:51.451
You!

1010
01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:53.703
You ruined my life!

1011
01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.540
You ruined my life!

1012
01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:58.708
I do apologise about that, Pete.

1013
01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:00.919
Eighty-four years old!

1014
01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.463
I'll be gummin' pabulum!

1015
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:11.471
Now, boys, boys...

1016
01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:16.703
O Death

1017
01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:22.083
O Death

1018
01:14:22.167 --> 01:14:27.213
Won't you spare me over to another year

1019
01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:35.430
Well I am Death. None can excel

1020
01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:39.934
I'll open the door to heaven or hell

1021
01:14:40.018 --> 01:14:42.937
O Death, someone would pray

1022
01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:46.941
Could you wait to call me another day?

1023
01:14:49.069 --> 01:14:50.987
It's Tommy. They got Tommy.

1024
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:52.322
Oh, my Lord.

1025
01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:55.992
A noose.

1026
01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:02.248
Sweet Jesus, we gotta save him.

1027
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.128
I'll fix your feet till you can't walk

1028
01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:11.341
I'll lock your jaw till you can't talk

1029
01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:14.344
I'll close your eyes

1030
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.970
SO you can't see

1031
01:15:16.054 --> 01:15:17.514
This very hour, come and go with me

1032
01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:18.765
The colour guard.

1033
01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:24.646
And if I come to take the soul

1034
01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:28.233
Leave the body and leave it cold

1035
01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:32.946
O Death

1036
01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:37.575
O Death

1037
01:15:37.659 --> 01:15:41.996
Won't you spare me over to another year

1038
01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:46.876
Brothers!

1039
01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.755
Oh, brothers!

1040
01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:54.050
We are forgathered here

1041
01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:59.222
to preserve our hallowed
culture and heritage

1042
01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:03.518
from intrusion, inclusion

1043
01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:05.562
and dilution

1044
01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:08.481
of colour, of creed

1045
01:16:08.565 --> 01:16:10.900
and of our old-time religion!

1046
01:16:10.984 --> 01:16:15.613
We aim to pull evil up by the root

1047
01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:21.244
before it chokes out the flower
of our culture and heritage.

1048
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:25.915
And our women!
Let's not forget those ladies, y'all!

1049
01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:29.002
Lookin' to us for protection,

1050
01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.921
from darkies, from Jews,

1051
01:16:32.005 --> 01:16:33.923
from papists

1052
01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:40.096
and from all those smart-ass folks
say we come descended from monkeys.

1053
01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.099
- That's not my culture and heritage.
Yes!

1054
01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:47.228
- Is that your culture and heritage?
No!

1055
01:16:48.271 --> 01:16:50.190
And so,

1056
01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.567
we gonna hang us a negro.

1057
01:17:06.331 --> 01:17:09.459
I ain't never harmed you,
neither of you gentlemen.

1058
01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:35.068
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1059
01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.074
Hey! Hey, Tommy!
- Huh?

1060
01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.243
It's us. We come to rescue you.

1061
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.829
That's mighty kind of you boys,

1062
01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:48.748
but I don't think
nothin's gonna save me now.

1063
01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:51.876
The devil's come to collect his due.

1064
01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.338
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1065
01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:57.173
You don't wanna get hanged.

1066
01:17:57.966 --> 01:18:02.512
No, I don't reckon I do, but that's
the way it seems to be working out.

1067
01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:07.016
Listen, Tommy, I got a plan.

1068
01:18:17.485 --> 01:18:19.279
The colour guard is coloured.

1069
01:18:20.989 --> 01:18:22.907
Who made them the colour guard?

1070
01:18:25.994 --> 01:18:27.453
Run, boys!

1071
01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:35.712
No, no, son!

1072
01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:40.842
Can't let that flag touch the ground!

1073
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.641
Ooh!

1074
01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:11.748
Take your hands off me.
I can do this myself. Get away from me.

1075
01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.667
I'm saying we should hire this man away.

1076
01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:16.878
- That's a good idea, Pappy.
- Hell of an idea.

1077
01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:18.880
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- Have him join us.

1078
01:19:18.963 --> 01:19:20.882
Run our campaign. Steal that egghead's.

1079
01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.092
Enticements of power, wealth, et cetera.

1080
01:19:23.176 --> 01:19:26.512
- No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
- Oh, gracious, no.

1081
01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:28.932
- Not with his blandishments.
- Powers of persuasion.

1082
01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:30.725
What's his name again?

1083
01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.518
- Campaign manager?
- Yes.

1084
01:19:32.602 --> 01:19:34.437
- Waldrip.
- Vernon Waldrip.

1085
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.314
- Vernon T. Waldrip.
- Hmm.

1086
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:46.115
It's an invitation-only affair.

1087
01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:47.927
We'll have to sneak in
through the service entrance.

1088
01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:49.243
Hold on.

1089
01:19:49.327 --> 01:19:50.327
Wait a minute.

1090
01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:52.830
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

1091
01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:55.124
Since we been followin' your lead,

1092
01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.126
we got nothin' but trouble.

1093
01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:00.046
I got this close to bein' strung up,

1094
01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:03.299
and consumed in a fire,
and whipped no end,

1095
01:20:03.383 --> 01:20:05.426
and sunstroked and soggied...

1096
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:08.721
- Turned into a frog.
- He wasn't turned into a frog.

1097
01:20:09.847 --> 01:20:11.724
Almost loved up, though.

1098
01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:15.520
So you're against me now, too?

1099
01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:18.606
Is that how it is, boys?

1100
01:20:21.693 --> 01:20:25.113
The whole world, God Almighty,

1101
01:20:25.196 --> 01:20:26.239
and now you.

1102
01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:32.161
Guess I deserve it.

1103
01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:38.626
Boys, I know that I made
some tactical mistakes.

1104
01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.922
But if you just stick
with me, I got a plan.

1105
01:20:43.006 --> 01:20:45.675
Believe me, boys, we can fix this thing.

1106
01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:48.511
I can get my wife back,
and we can get out of here.

1107
01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.518
Goddamn disgrace!

1108
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.271
Made a travesty of the entire evening.

1109
01:20:59.272 --> 01:21:02.233
What I wouldn't give
to get a hold of those agitators.

1110
01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:06.112
I mean, whoever heard of such behaviour,
even amongst the coloured?

1111
01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:09.699
Well, mulattoes, maybe. I suspect
some miscegenation in their heritage.

1112
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:13.494
How else you gonna explain it?
Usin' the Confederate flag as a missile!

1113
01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:17.707
This is crazy. No one's ever
gonna believe we're a real band.

1114
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.710
It's gonna work. I just gotta
get close enough to talk to her.

1115
01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:23.796
Takin' off with us has got more future
than marryin' some guy named Waldrip.

1116
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.548
I'm goddamn bona fide.

1117
01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:29.052
- I've got the answers.
Everett, my beard itches.

1118
01:21:41.689 --> 01:21:44.067
In The Jailhouse Now, fellers.

1119
01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:45.610
Neighbourhood of B.

1120
01:21:52.784 --> 01:21:53.785
Psst.

1121
01:21:58.664 --> 01:21:59.665
It's me.

1122
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.126
No.

1123
01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:09.217
I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob

1124
01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.136
He used to steal, gamble and rob

1125
01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.849
He thought he was the smartest guy around

1126
01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:22.188
We're leavin' the state,

1127
01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.774
pursuin' opportunities in another venue.

1128
01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:26.025
I got big plans.

1129
01:22:26.109 --> 01:22:29.237
Not minstrels. This here's just a dodge.
I'm gonna be a dentist.

1130
01:22:30.029 --> 01:22:32.115
I know this guy who'll
print me up a licence.

1131
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:37.286
He's in the jailhouse now

1132
01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:41.582
-Well I told him once or twice

1133
01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:45.878
To stop playin' cards and a-shootin' dice

1134
01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.464
He's in the jailhouse now

1135
01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:11.988
Bob liked to play his poker

1136
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.325
Well, that is an improper suggestion.

1137
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:21.164
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign,

1138
01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:25.376
especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fibre.

1139
01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.838
Moral fibre? Why, you pasty-faced sumbitch.

1140
01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.715
I invented moral fibre.

1141
01:23:30.798 --> 01:23:33.509
Pappy O'Daniel was displaying
rectitude and high-mindedness

1142
01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:36.888
when that egghead you work for
was still messin' his drawers.

1143
01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:39.891
Honey.
- Go away.

1144
01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:44.228
I want to be what you want me to be.
I want you and the gals to come with me.

1145
01:23:44.312 --> 01:23:46.564
[ told him once or twice

1146
01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:50.276
to stop playin' cards and a-shootin' dice

1147
01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.279
What are you doing here, Pappy?

1148
01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:56.728
I guess someone let on
we were givin' out liquor.

1149
01:23:57.033 --> 01:23:59.869
You'll be laughin' out the other side
of your face come November.

1150
01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:01.871
Pappy O'Daniel
will be laughin' then.

1151
01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:03.873
Not out the other side of his face, though.

1152
01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.541
Oh, no, just the regular side.

1153
01:24:19.305 --> 01:24:20.765
They're my daughters too, Penny.

1154
01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:24.310
Ain't you ever heard of...

1155
01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.897
In constant sorrow

1156
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.066
All through his days

1157
01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:45.164
/

1158
01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:47.416
Am a man

1159
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.419
of constant sorrow

1160
01:24:50.503 --> 01:24:52.922
I've seen trouble

1161
01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:56.008
Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!

1162
01:24:56.592 --> 01:25:00.846
I bid farewell

1163
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:03.599
to old Kentucky

1164
01:25:03.683 --> 01:25:06.227
The place where |

1165
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.354
was born and raised

1166
01:25:09.021 --> 01:25:11.607
The place where he

1167
01:25:11.691 --> 01:25:14.402
was born and raised

1168
01:25:35.506 --> 01:25:38.009
Holy moley! These boys are a hit!

1169
01:25:38.092 --> 01:25:40.386
But Pappy, they's integrated.

1170
01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:42.972
Wait a minute.

1171
01:25:43.389 --> 01:25:45.725
Well, I guess folks don't mind
they's integrated.

1172
01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.935
You's miscegenated.

1173
01:25:48.019 --> 01:25:50.438
All you boys is miscegenated!

1174
01:25:50.521 --> 01:25:52.982
Give me a microphone!
Give me a microphone!

1175
01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.483
Give me a microphone!

1176
01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:57.069
These boys is not white.

1177
01:25:57.361 --> 01:26:00.698
These boys is not white.
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1178
01:26:01.282 --> 01:26:03.451
Look, I happen to know,
ladies and gentlemen,

1179
01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:05.494
that this band of miscreants here,

1180
01:26:05.578 --> 01:26:08.581
this very evening
interfered with a lynch mob

1181
01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.708
in the performance of its duties.

1182
01:26:12.209 --> 01:26:13.586
It's true!

1183
01:26:13.878 --> 01:26:16.672
See, I belong to a certain secret society.

1184
01:26:16.756 --> 01:26:19.842
I don't believe I gotta mention
its name, you know.

1185
01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.678
Let 'em play!
Hush him up!

1186
01:26:23.971 --> 01:26:25.723
And these boys here,

1187
01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:29.477
they trampled all over
our venerated observances and rituals.

1188
01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:33.356
Now, this here music is over. All right?

1189
01:26:36.442 --> 01:26:37.443
Boo!

1190
01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.612
Folks, listen to me.

1191
01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:43.491
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

1192
01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:46.952
Y'all having a good time?

1193
01:26:47.036 --> 01:26:51.248
And they's convicts, folks!
Fugitives escaped off the farm!

1194
01:26:51.332 --> 01:26:55.211
Now, folks, these boys gotta be
remanded to the authorities!

1195
01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:56.420
Criminals!

1196
01:26:56.504 --> 01:26:59.215
And I have it from the highest authority

1197
01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:02.885
that that negro sold his soul to the devil!

1198
01:27:03.344 --> 01:27:04.678
- Oh!

1199
01:27:04.762 --> 01:27:07.390
Wait a minute,
now, folks. It's true!

1200
01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:10.059
It's true!

1201
01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:11.477
Wait a minute, folks.

1202
01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.647
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?

1203
01:27:15.898 --> 01:27:19.110
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?

1204
01:27:25.366 --> 01:27:28.744
Is you is or is you ain't my constituency?

1205
01:27:28.828 --> 01:27:31.414
- Oh! Come on, folks!
Shut up!

1206
01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:35.292
It's Homer, now! Come on.
I'm the friend of the little man!

1207
01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:07.950
It's fare thee well

1208
01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:10.536
My own true lover

1209
01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:13.372
I never expect

1210
01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:16.375
to see you again

1211
01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.211
For

1212
01:28:19.295 --> 01:28:21.881
I'm bound to ride

1213
01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:24.550
that northern railroad

1214
01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.595
Perhaps I'll die

1215
01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:30.139
upon that train

1216
01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:33.309
Perhaps he'll die

1217
01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:35.769
upon that train

1218
01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:38.772
Goddamn! Opportunity knocks!

1219
01:28:39.732 --> 01:28:41.400
Get out of my way!

1220
01:28:42.276 --> 01:28:44.987
I'm just a stranger

1221
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:50.242
My face you'll never see no more

1222
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:56.457
But there is one promise

1223
01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:58.834
that is given

1224
01:28:58.918 --> 01:29:01.545
I'll meet you on

1225
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:04.048
God's golden shore

1226
01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:07.384
He'll meet you on

1227
01:29:07.468 --> 01:29:09.678
God's golden shore

1228
01:29:10.221 --> 01:29:12.556
That's fine! That's fine!

1229
01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:19.480
Ladies and gentlemens,

1230
01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:22.191
here and listenin' at home,

1231
01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:25.528
the great state of Mississippi,

1232
01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:27.696
Pappy O'Daniel, governor,

1233
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.034
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys
for that wonderful performance.

1234
01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:40.543
Now, it looks like the only man
in this great state

1235
01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:42.378
who ain't a music lover

1236
01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:46.799
is my esteemed opponent
in the upcomin', Homer Stokes.

1237
01:29:48.467 --> 01:29:50.278
Yeah, well, there ain't
no accountin' for taste.

1238
01:29:50.302 --> 01:29:53.597
Sounded to me like he was harbourin'
some kind of hateful grudge

1239
01:29:53.681 --> 01:29:55.599
against the Soggy Bottom Boys,

1240
01:29:55.683 --> 01:29:57.810
on account of their rough and rowdy past.

1241
01:30:00.396 --> 01:30:03.399
Looks like Homer
Stokes is the kind of fella

1242
01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:05.651
wants to cast the first stone.

1243
01:30:06.777 --> 01:30:08.904
Well, I'm with you folks.

1244
01:30:08.988 --> 01:30:12.491
I'm a forgive and forget
Christian, and I say

1245
01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:16.996
if their rambunctiousness
and misdemeanorin' is behind 'em...

1246
01:30:18.038 --> 01:30:19.665
It is, ain't it, boys?

1247
01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:21.417
Yes, sir, it is.

1248
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:26.130
Well, then I say, by
the power vested in me,

1249
01:30:26.213 --> 01:30:29.008
these boys is hereby pardoned!

1250
01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:34.638
And furthermore,

1251
01:30:35.848 --> 01:30:38.851
in the second Pappy
O'Daniel administration,

1252
01:30:38.934 --> 01:30:42.730
these boys is gonna be my brain trust.

1253
01:30:47.234 --> 01:30:48.694
What's that mean, Everett?

1254
01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:52.489
Well, Delmar, it means
that you and me and Pete and Tommy

1255
01:30:52.573 --> 01:30:56.076
are gonna be the power
behind the throne, so to speak.

1256
01:30:56.744 --> 01:30:58.162
Oh. Okay.

1257
01:30:58.245 --> 01:31:00.164
So, without further ado,

1258
01:31:00.247 --> 01:31:03.375
and by way of endorsin' my candidacy,

1259
01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:07.588
the Soggy Bottom Boys
is gonna lead us all in a chorus of

1260
01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:09.590
You Are My Sunshine.

1261
01:31:10.466 --> 01:31:11.800
Ain't ya, boys?

1262
01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.803
Governor, it's one of our favourites.

1263
01:31:14.887 --> 01:31:16.472
Son,

1264
01:31:16.555 --> 01:31:18.432
you're gonna go far.

1265
01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:22.269
You are my sunshine

1266
01:31:22.353 --> 01:31:24.980
My only sunshine

1267
01:31:25.064 --> 01:31:27.816
You make me happy

1268
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.235
when skies are grey

1269
01:31:30.319 --> 01:31:32.946
You'll never know, dear

1270
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.824
how much I love you

1271
01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:40.746
Please don't take my sunshine away

1272
01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:48.379
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip
is gonna be goin' on relief.

1273
01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:51.382
Maybe I can throw a
little patronage his way.

1274
01:31:51.465 --> 01:31:54.677
Get him a job diggin' ditches
or roundin' up stray dogs.

1275
01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:57.262
So, is the marriage off then, Miss Wharvey?

1276
01:31:57.346 --> 01:31:58.681
McGill.

1277
01:31:58.764 --> 01:32:01.350
No, the marriage will
take place as planned.

1278
01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:03.435
Little change of cast.

1279
01:32:03.519 --> 01:32:06.980
Me and the little lady are gonna
pick up the pieces and retie the knot,

1280
01:32:07.064 --> 01:32:09.024
mixaphorically speaking.

1281
01:32:09.108 --> 01:32:11.360
You boys are invited, of course.

1282
01:32:11.610 --> 01:32:13.445
Hell, you're the best men.

1283
01:32:13.779 --> 01:32:14.947
Already got the rings.

1284
01:32:16.115 --> 01:32:17.241
Where's your ring, honey?

1285
01:32:17.324 --> 01:32:20.035
I ain't worn it
since our divorce came through.

1286
01:32:20.119 --> 01:32:23.747
Must still be in the roll-top in the
old cabin. Never thought I'd need it.

1287
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:25.749
Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.

1288
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:28.168
Now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

1289
01:32:30.129 --> 01:32:33.132
We ain't gettin' married with his ring.
You said you'd changed.

1290
01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:36.427
- Honey, yours is just an old pewter thing.
- Ain't gon' be no weddin'.

1291
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:38.554
- It's just a symbol, honey.
- No weddin'.

1292
01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:40.889
We'll go fetch it with you, Everett.

1293
01:32:40.973 --> 01:32:43.600
Shut up, Delmar. It's just a symbol.

1294
01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.311
I've spoken my piece and counted to three.

1295
01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:48.647
She counted to three.

1296
01:32:49.481 --> 01:32:52.901
God damn it. She counted to three.

1297
01:32:52.985 --> 01:32:54.403
Son of a bitch!

1298
01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:56.613
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

1299
01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.424
George?

1300
01:33:15.507 --> 01:33:17.259
Hello, boys!

1301
01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:21.764
Well, these little men finally caught up
with the criminal of the century!

1302
01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:24.141
Looks like the chair for George Nelson!

1303
01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:26.977
Yup! Gonna electrify me!

1304
01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:29.563
I'm gonna go off like a Roman candle!

1305
01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:34.568
Twenty-thousand volts
chasin' a rabbit through yours truly.

1306
01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:38.447
Goddamn! Gonna suck all the power
right out of the state!

1307
01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.116
Gonna shoot sparks out the top of my head

1308
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.410
and lightning from my fingertips!

1309
01:33:43.494 --> 01:33:47.873
I'm George Nelson,
and I'm feelin' 10 feet tall!

1310
01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:51.460
Looks like George is
right back on top again.

1311
01:33:52.878 --> 01:33:54.505
Cow Killer!

1312
01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:11.396
At least you boys
get to see the ancestral manse,

1313
01:34:11.480 --> 01:34:14.399
the home where I spent so many a happy day

1314
01:34:14.483 --> 01:34:16.401
in the bosom of my family.

1315
01:34:16.485 --> 01:34:19.822
A refugium, if you will,
with a mighty oak tree out front

1316
01:34:19.905 --> 01:34:22.366
and a happy little tyre swing kinda...

1317
01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:30.082
Where's the happy little tyre swing?

1318
01:34:33.085 --> 01:34:35.546
End of the road, boys.

1319
01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:38.590
- Now, wait a minute.
- Let's go, boys.

1320
01:34:38.674 --> 01:34:41.510
- It's had its twists and turns.
- Wait a minute, now.

1321
01:34:41.593 --> 01:34:43.220
Now, it deposits you here.

1322
01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:45.138
Wait a minute.

1323
01:34:45.222 --> 01:34:48.684
You have eluded fate
and you have eluded me

1324
01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:50.352
for the last time.

1325
01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:52.521
Tie their hands, boys.

1326
01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.064
You can't do this now.

1327
01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:56.942
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.

1328
01:34:57.025 --> 01:34:59.236
He'll just have to wait his turn.

1329
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:01.446
Share one of your graves.

1330
01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:04.867
You can't do this. We just got
pardoned by the governor hisself.

1331
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:06.869
It went out on the radio.

1332
01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.288
Is that right?

1333
01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:14.126
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1334
01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.047
God have mercy.

1335
01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:27.139
You

1336
01:35:27.222 --> 01:35:28.974
got to go

1337
01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:32.144
to that lonesome valley

1338
01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:36.106
You

1339
01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:43.989
It ain't fit.

1340
01:35:44.615 --> 01:35:45.824
It ain't the law.

1341
01:35:45.908 --> 01:35:47.326
The law?

1342
01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:52.164
The law is a human institution.

1343
01:35:52.831 --> 01:35:56.460
Nobody else

1344
01:35:56.543 --> 01:36:00.339
can go there for you, no

1345
01:36:00.422 --> 01:36:03.258
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1346
01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:14.353
Got

1347
01:36:14.436 --> 01:36:16.355
to go

1348
01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:18.106
Oh, my God.

1349
01:36:18.190 --> 01:36:19.650
Everett.

1350
01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:24.029
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

1351
01:36:24.237 --> 01:36:26.365
Good Lord,

1352
01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:28.325
what do we do?

1353
01:36:28.784 --> 01:36:31.745
By

1354
01:36:31.828 --> 01:36:34.373
Yourself

1355
01:36:38.585 --> 01:36:40.045
Lord,

1356
01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:44.633
please look down
and recognise us poor sinners.

1357
01:36:48.053 --> 01:36:49.721
Please, Lord,

1358
01:36:50.389 --> 01:36:52.891
I just wanna see my daughters again.

1359
01:36:54.476 --> 01:36:57.396
I been separated from
my family for so long.

1360
01:36:58.814 --> 01:37:02.109
I know I been guilty
of pride and sharp dealin'.

1361
01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:04.069
I'm sorry that I turned my back on you.

1362
01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:07.155
Forgive me

1363
01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:09.950
and help us, Lord.

1364
01:37:10.867 --> 01:37:14.579
For the sake of my family.
For Tommy's sake.

1365
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:16.832
For Delmar's and Pete's.

1366
01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.045
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

1367
01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:25.757
Help us.

1368
01:37:25.841 --> 01:37:27.259
Please.

1369
01:37:42.941 --> 01:37:45.193
You

1370
01:37:45.277 --> 01:37:46.987
got to go

1371
01:37:47.070 --> 01:37:50.699
to the lonesome valley

1372
01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:51.783
Yes, sir!

1373
01:37:51.867 --> 01:37:53.452
You

1374
01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:02.461
got

1375
01:38:05.630 --> 01:38:10.385
to go

1376
01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:15.557
there

1377
01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.562
by

1378
01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:22.439
Yourself

1379
01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:26.401
Nobody else

1380
01:38:26.485 --> 01:38:30.405
Nobody else can go for you

1381
01:38:30.489 --> 01:38:33.492
You

1382
01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:45.420
got

1383
01:38:45.504 --> 01:38:49.966

1384
01:38:50.050 --> 01:38:52.844
there

1385
01:38:56.098 --> 01:39:01.269

1386
01:39:01.353 --> 01:39:04.397
Yourself

1387
01:39:42.435 --> 01:39:45.188
A miracle! It was a miracle!

1388
01:39:45.272 --> 01:39:48.525
Delmar, don't be ignorant.
I told you they was floodin' this valley.

1389
01:39:48.608 --> 01:39:52.112
- No, that ain't it.
- We prayed to God, and he pitied us.

1390
01:39:52.195 --> 01:39:53.864
Well, it never fails.

1391
01:39:53.947 --> 01:39:57.450
Once again, you two hayseeds are
showin' how much you want for intellect.

1392
01:39:57.576 --> 01:40:00.328
There's a perfectly scientific explanation
for what just happened.

1393
01:40:00.412 --> 01:40:03.874
That ain't the tune you was singin'
back at the gallows.

1394
01:40:04.124 --> 01:40:07.502
Well, any human being will cast about
in @ moment of stress.

1395
01:40:07.586 --> 01:40:10.255
No, the fact is, they're
floodin' this valley

1396
01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:13.091
so they can hydroelectric up
the whole durn state.

1397
01:40:13.175 --> 01:40:16.094
Yes, sir, the South is gonna change.

1398
01:40:16.178 --> 01:40:19.681
Everything's gonna be put on electricity
and run on a pa yin' basis.

1399
01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:24.060
Out with the old spiritual mumbo jumbo,
the superstitions and the backward ways.

1400
01:40:24.144 --> 01:40:27.314
We're gonna see a brave new world
where they run everybody a wire

1401
01:40:27.397 --> 01:40:29.524
and hook us all up to a grid.

1402
01:40:29.608 --> 01:40:33.486
Yes, sir, a veritable age of reason,
like the one they had in France.

1403
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:35.488
Not a moment too soon.

1404
01:40:40.911 --> 01:40:42.829
Not a moment too soon.

1405
01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:46.374
Hey, there's Tommy.

1406
01:40:46.458 --> 01:40:48.501
Tommy, what you ridin' there?

1407
01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:51.838
Whoa.

1408
01:40:52.797 --> 01:40:54.507
Roll-top desk.

1409
01:40:54.591 --> 01:40:59.554
My latest sun is sinking fast

1410
01:40:59.638 --> 01:41:03.558
My race is nearly run

1411
01:41:03.642 --> 01:41:06.519
All's well that ends
well, so the poet said.

1412
01:41:06.603 --> 01:41:08.021
That's right, honey.

1413
01:41:08.104 --> 01:41:10.899
I don't mind tellin' you I'm awful pleased

1414
01:41:10.982 --> 01:41:13.860
my adventurin' days have come to an end.

1415
01:41:13.944 --> 01:41:16.738
It's time for this ol' boy
to enjoy some repose.

1416
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:20.408
- That's good.
- You were right about that ring, too.

1417
01:41:20.617 --> 01:41:23.995
Any other weddin' band wouldn't do.

1418
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:25.830
This here were foreordained.

1419
01:41:25.956 --> 01:41:27.934
Fate was a-smilin' on me,
you just have to have confidence...

1420
01:41:27.958 --> 01:41:29.918
- That's not my ring.
- What?

1421
01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:31.586
That's not my ring.

1422
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:33.797
- Not your ring?
- That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

1423
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.068
- You said it was in the roll-top desk.
- I said I thought it was in the roll-top desk.

1424
01:41:37.092 --> 01:41:39.094
- No, you said...
- Or under the mattress.

1425
01:41:39.177 --> 01:41:41.429
Maybe my chiffo-robe. I don't know.

1426
01:41:41.513 --> 01:41:44.307
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1427
01:41:44.391 --> 01:41:45.934
We need that ring.

1428
01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:48.603
Well, that ring is at the bottom
of a pretty durn big lake.

1429
01:41:48.687 --> 01:41:49.771
Uh-uh.

1430
01:41:49.854 --> 01:41:53.275
- A 9,000-hectare lake.
- I don't care if it's 90,000.

1431
01:41:53.358 --> 01:41:55.277
- That lake was not my doing.
- Of course not.

1432
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:58.571
- I counted to three, honey.
- No, wait, honey.

1433
01:41:58.655 --> 01:42:02.826
Finding one little ring in the middle of
all that water is one hell of a heroic task.

1434
01:42:02.909 --> 01:42:08.039
And gives me victory

1435
01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:10.750
Oh, come

1436
01:42:10.917 --> 01:42:13.503
Angel band

1437
01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:18.300
Come and around me stand

1438
01:42:18.383 --> 01:42:23.471
Oh, bear me away
on your snow white wings

1439
01:42:23.555 --> 01:42:28.810
to my immortal home

1440
01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:34.274
Oh, bear me away
on your snow white wings

1441
01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:40.030
to my immortal home
