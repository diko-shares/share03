00:00:01,366 --> 00:00:02,683
Previously
on "The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,687
Does Elena
enjoy having both of you

3
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:06,836
worship at her altar?
I love you.

4
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:11,464
But look me in the eye and tell me
that you don't feel something for him.

5
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:13,850
To break the sire bond,
you've got make yourself turn.

6
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:17,988
I just turned about a hundred
times in the appalachian mountains.

7
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,740
Won't know if it's broken
for sure until I test it.

8
00:00:19,742 --> 00:00:21,825
If you are to kill
all of my children,

9
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:24,477
I will need to bind
your ring to the stake,

10
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,747
rendering the white oak
indestructible.

11
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:28,332
What are you doing
with him?

12
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:29,700
I'm going to remake him.

13
00:00:29,702 --> 00:00:31,618
Make him strong, fast.

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,453
A true hunter.

15
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,005
Aaah! Oh!

16
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:36,757
I'm not going to complete
the transition.

17
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,525
We're just going to lock
you in here and let you die?

18
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:40,544
I can't be a vampire.

19
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,146
What do you mean,
you're ditching

20
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:35,148
my clean-up committee?
Klaus called.

21
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,684
He's leaving town and wants
me to pack up his house.

22
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:40,153
Well, since when does sire
bond equal mover slave?

23
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:43,240
Since he realized you're not
going to dump me for him.

24
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:45,409
He's being petty.

25
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,027
And he still thinks
I'm sired to him.

26
00:01:47,029 --> 00:01:48,995
It's fine.
I'll keep up the act

27
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:51,982
and it will all be over soon.

28
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm late. I've got to go.
I love you.

29
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,420
I love you, too.

30
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,043
Hello?

31
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:12,419
Where's Matt?

32
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,104
He bailed.

33
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:16,106
Got called into work
at the last minute.

34
00:02:16,108 --> 00:02:17,607
Are you kidding me?

35
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:19,609
So it's just us?

36
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:20,894
Yes, and you're late.

37
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,096
Clean-up committee
started at 8:00.

38
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:25,132
It's like 8:02.
Exactly.

39
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:26,566
I managed
to turn up on time

40
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:27,818
and I didn't even get
to attend the dance

41
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,237
<i>that I organized.</i>

42
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:39,779
I'm sorry
about your mom.

43
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:43,133
I mean, I know you,
like, you hated her

44
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:47,137
and everything,
but still.

45
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,505
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:53,126
Sorry about your teacher.

47
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:55,979
He seemed like a nice guy.

48
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,082
Yeah. He was.

49
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:04,821
I'm going to get
started on the gym.

50
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:17,667
You're supposed to be dead.
I am.

51
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:56,076

52
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:08,535
Going darker, huh?

53
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:11,037
It's the only color we had.

54
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,139
That's what happens when you decide
to paint your dead guardian's room

55
00:04:13,141 --> 00:04:15,308
in the middle
of the night.

56
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,726
I don't suppose anyone
tried to talk you guys

57
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:18,562
out of doing this...
So soon.

58
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,380
We have to keep moving.

59
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,182
Otherwise we'll start thinking,

60
00:04:22,184 --> 00:04:24,684
and we don't want to think.
You want a hand?

61
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:27,487
So are you two, like,
back together or something?

62
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,523
What? No, jerm,
we're just...

63
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,658
I was just checking up on you guys,
seeing how you were doing.

64
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,345
After, uh...
After everything.

65
00:04:35,347 --> 00:04:38,899
We're fine. But, if you are
trying to be the good guy again,

66
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:41,734
why don't you do the right
thing and give us one day.

67
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:44,421
Just one day without
any vampires in it.

68
00:04:51,796 --> 00:04:54,747
He didn't mean that.

69
00:04:54,749 --> 00:04:57,551
Yeah... Yeah, he did.

70
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,221
I'll get that.

71
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,948
We have a problem.

72
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,884
Alaric Saltzman
just tried to kill me.

73
00:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,036
Alaric Saltzman
is supposed to be dead.

74
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:19,105
Well, he's not! And he's
a vampire thanks to mother's spell.

75
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,541
With a white oak stake
that can't kill him.

76
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:24,160
He's stronger, Nick.
Too strong.

77
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,795
Where is he now?

78
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,414
Stuck at the school
without a daylight ring,

79
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,799
but as soon as night falls,
he'll come after us.

80
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,067
We need to leave now.

81
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:33,253
Fine.

82
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:35,889
I'll collect Elena
and we'll be on our way.

83
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,292
Forget Elena! You don't need
any more stupid hybrids!

84
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:43,463
What I need is protection from
Esther's continued assaults against us.

85
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,615
We'll protect each other,

86
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:47,684
like we always have.

87
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:53,256
Always and forever, Nik.

88
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,859
I'm not leaving
without her.

89
00:05:57,111 --> 00:06:00,947
I'm leaving now.

90
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,749
You can either walk
out that door with me

91
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,668
or you are
on your own.

92
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,990
Fine.

93
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:13,927
Trust your hybrids
over your family.

94
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:17,547
Let your spite be the death of you.
See if I care.

95
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:20,684
Move it, sire boy.

96
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,386
What's her deal?

97
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:27,691
What do you mean,
he turned?

98
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,225
I thought you were
standing guard.

99
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,344
Don't blame me!
Blame Bonnie the blood bank.

100
00:06:31,346 --> 00:06:32,812
She fed him.

101
00:06:32,814 --> 00:06:35,181
I had no idea
what was happening.

102
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,516
OK, the witches led me there.

103
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,351
They wanted him to feed
so he'd turn.

104
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:39,486
So where's the stake now?

105
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,137
Oh, you mean
the white oak one?

106
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,455
The one that can
kill an original

107
00:06:42,457 --> 00:06:43,990
and wipe out an entire
line of vampires?

108
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,209
We don't know.
If you are so upset with me,

109
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,628
why did you feed me
your blood to save my life?

110
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,380
Because I do stupid
things, Bonnie.

111
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:52,132
I do things,
like let my friend

112
00:06:52,134 --> 00:06:55,034
die with dignity when
I should have just killed him.

113
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,388
All right, so how
do we kill him now?

114
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,323
I've been trying
to figure that out.

115
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,392
A witch can't truly
make an immortal creature.

116
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:05,878
There's always a way
to undo a spell.

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,063
So?

118
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,898
What's the witchy
workaround?

119
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,434
That's the problem.

120
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,021
I don't know.

121
00:07:22,747 --> 00:07:25,865
Whoever this is,
it's not funny.

122
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:29,035
Who else would it be?

123
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,271
Ric?

124
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:34,257
Listen closely.
I'm at the school.

125
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,342
I have Caroline.

126
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:38,678
And if you want
to keep her alive,

127
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
I need you
to get into your car

128
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:42,382
and come down here
right away.

129
00:07:42,384 --> 00:07:46,219
If you tell anyone
where you are going,

130
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:48,805
I will kill her.

131
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,066
What the hell
do you want?

132
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,118
Now is that any way
to treat a guest?

133
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,204
What are you doing
here, Klaus?

134
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:06,790
Well, for starters, young Jeremy
here could show some manners

135
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:08,074
and invite me inside.

136
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:10,794
Why don't you go up
to your room.

137
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:14,247
Now.

138
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:20,220
Hmm. Poor lad.

139
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,755
Loses one questionable
father figure

140
00:08:21,757 --> 00:08:23,923
only to be replaced by
the likes of the two of you.

141
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:27,010
Yeah, about that.
Something happened.

142
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:29,295
Oh, I know all about my mother's
invulnerable little creation.

143
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:31,631
That's why I'm here.
I'm leaving town.

144
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,250
I just need to pick up
a few road trip necessities.

145
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,936
Spare tire, flashlight...

146
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:38,938
Doppelganger.

147
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,024
Can't
help you there.

148
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,198
Elena!

149
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:09,502
Where is she?

150
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,472
I don't know. She was just
here a few minutes ago.

151
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,676
Where is she?

152
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:17,944
She's not here.

153
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,779
What do you mean,
she's not here?

154
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:23,349
Where did she go?!
What's going on?

155
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:25,068
Klaus wants in.

156
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:29,205
We have to keep him out.

157
00:09:29,207 --> 00:09:31,574
Duck!

158
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:44,277
Right on time.

159
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:07,166
Caroline!

160
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,503
Let her go, Alaric.

161
00:10:10,505 --> 00:10:12,805
Free her yourself.

162
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:24,400
Hey.

163
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,713
You said that
you would let her go!

164
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,198
How many times do I have
to tell you, Elena?

165
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,834
Stop trusting vampires!

166
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:51,661
Think you're probably
going to want to let me in.

167
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,668
Elena's car is gone.

168
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,070
Why wouldn't she tell
anyone where she was going?

169
00:11:24,378 --> 00:11:27,580
Get down!
Missed me!

170
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,889
Missed me again!

171
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:41,310
Alaric.

172
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,032
Put it out.

173
00:11:46,034 --> 00:11:48,100
Come outside
and make me.

174
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,937
Elena's not here.
Alaric has her and Caroline.

175
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:55,625
He's going to kill them both unless
you turn yourself over to him.

176
00:12:04,536 --> 00:12:06,469
Now I know
you're not asking me

177
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:07,970
to walk into
a certain death.

178
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:10,640
I really wish we could.

179
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,625
But unfortunately,
if Alaric kills you,

180
00:12:12,627 --> 00:12:14,627
there's a one in four chance
that we die, too.

181
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,978
I'll take those odds.

182
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,346
And a hundred percent
chance that Tyler dies.

183
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:19,565
I'm good with that, too.

184
00:12:19,567 --> 00:12:24,821
Why don't we just figure out
a way to put Alaric down, hmm?

185
00:12:29,243 --> 00:12:32,111
OK. How about Damon sneaks
in and distracts Alaric

186
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:34,697
while Stefan grabs Elena
and carries her to safety.

187
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:37,950
Oh, that's a great idea. What's to
stop me from being killed instantly?

188
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:40,119
Nothing.
Caroline's in there.

189
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,921
Don't you have
a thing for her,

190
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,423
or did she just reject you
too many times?

191
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:46,342
This isn't really, uh,
helping too much.

192
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:48,511
I might have an idea.

193
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:50,796
My mom used
a desiccation spell

194
00:12:50,798 --> 00:12:53,349
on mikael that immobilized
him for over 15 years.

195
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:56,001
If I can get it, I might be
able to use it on Alaric.

196
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,938
If and might. Your words
inspire such confidence.

197
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,973
I'll get it.
But even with the spell,

198
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,826
we'll need a lot of vampire
muscle to take him down.

199
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,845
Including yours.

200
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:10,816
Just so we're clear,

201
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,035
the sun sets
in about eight hours.

202
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:15,321
We don't succeed
before then,

203
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:17,123
Elena will be dead,
I'll be gone,

204
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:20,272
and the rest of you will be
left to fend for yourselves.

205
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,750
No, don't, please don't.

206
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,335
Alaric, stop!

207
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,036
Sit down!

208
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:36,041
This keeps the vervain
in her system.

209
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:39,228
It's like inhaling razor
blades with every breath.

210
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,351
Why are you doing this?

211
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:48,738
To make it easier on you when
you put her out of her misery.

212
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,941
What? No!

213
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:54,226
Isn't this what you wanted, Elena?
For me to teach you

214
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,861
how to kill
a vampire?

215
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,247
Well, here's
a vampire, Elena.

216
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,567
Kill her.

217
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:03,953
This isn't what I want.
Of course it is.

218
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:07,089
All those hours you spent training,
getting stronger...

219
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:09,875
You could be
a hunter, Elena.

220
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:12,094
But you've never
actually staked

221
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:13,912
a vampire
through the heart.

222
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:28,394
Well,
this is promising.

223
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,846
Relax.

224
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:32,448
Abby will be here.

225
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,617
I'm sorry. I forgot
about her stellar track record

226
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:37,053
in the dependability
department.

227
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,656
Jamie said
she was coming, OK?

228
00:14:39,658 --> 00:14:42,242
Just... Give her time.

229
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:47,330
Don't get your hopes up.
Might be a girl scout.

230
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:52,502
Hello, Bonnie.

231
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:56,038
Thanks for coming.

232
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,207
Jamie's worried about you.

233
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:00,760
He said it was urgent.

234
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:04,681
I just didn't think you'd
ever want to see me again.

235
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:07,850
Like Jamie said...

236
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,236
It's urgent.

237
00:15:21,732 --> 00:15:24,900
Abby just showed up.

238
00:15:24,902 --> 00:15:29,656
Good. Perhaps this plan won't be
an epic failure after all.

239
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:32,425
You know,
if this does go off

240
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:34,360
and we drop the history
teacher in the Atlantic,

241
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:37,113
I'm still leaving with Elena.

242
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:39,565
I'll go with you.

243
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:40,934
Really?

244
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:43,386
What's the catch?

245
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:44,854
There's no catch.

246
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,190
I turn my back
on everything here

247
00:15:47,192 --> 00:15:49,058
to make sure
Elena's safe.

248
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,463
And that is what makes you
her better option.

249
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,732
It's a shame it's not
easier for Elena to see that.

250
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,117
I mean, personally, I think she's
wasting her time with Damon.

251
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,071
You know, all this time
and energy you spend

252
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,074
trying to get me and my brother
to hate each other...

253
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:06,793
It's actually had
the opposite effect.

254
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:10,046
- Has it?
- Has it really?

255
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:12,248
Well, then perhaps
I should let Elena decide

256
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,033
which Salvatore joins us.

257
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:17,003
I mean, if you and Damon
are so close.

258
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,172
Ah, go for it.

259
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:22,625
Damon and I have been through
a hell of a lot worse than you.

260
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,697
Why didn't I have to be
invited in?

261
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,399
Only vampires live here.

262
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,567
We had signed over
the deed to Elena,

263
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:34,303
but she died
and the seal broke.

264
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,806
And... It's
a very long story.

265
00:16:36,808 --> 00:16:38,691
Blood?

266
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:42,195
Oh, come on.

267
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:43,997
Think of it
as a peace offering.

268
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,867
Fine.

269
00:16:47,869 --> 00:16:49,985
More for me.

270
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:57,627
We called you here because
I need help with a spell.

271
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:01,264
Esther created a vampire
that can't be killed.

272
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:04,400
I want to desiccate him
like you did to mikael.

273
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,452
Bonnie... It's too dangerous.

274
00:17:06,454 --> 00:17:10,005
Your magic comes
from the earth.

275
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,357
It's pure.

276
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,460
This spell asks you
to tap into dark places.

277
00:17:14,462 --> 00:17:17,196
Places of temptation.

278
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,815
Places you can't handle.

279
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:22,902
You turned your back
on me for 16 years.

280
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:25,805
You have no idea
what I can handle.

281
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:29,075
Got to say I'm team
Bonnie on this one.

282
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:31,778
How hard can it be
to parch a vampire?

283
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,998
The spell allows you
to stop a vampire's heart.

284
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The blood will stop flowing,

285
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,535
and his body will dissociate.

286
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,203
That's exactly what
we want to do.

287
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,989
To stop a vampire's heart,

288
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:46,175
you need to find a balance
among the living.

289
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:51,297
Can you handle that?

290
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:55,718
What? What does that mean?
Bonnie, I don't speak witch.

291
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,906
I have to stop
a human heart.

292
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:08,564
I just got this.

293
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,701
It connects me to Caroline
and Elena through our phones.

294
00:18:13,287 --> 00:18:14,921
They're in Alaric's classroom.

295
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:17,924
You should go in
from the South entrance.

296
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:19,408
Digital locator spell.

297
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,377
Why the hell do
we need you, then?

298
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:22,879
Hand it over.

299
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:25,348
I'm not giving you my ring.
Let me do this.

300
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,717
By my math, you've already
bit it once, possibly twice,

301
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:29,485
wearing that thing,
and if for some reason

302
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:32,038
Bonnie can't restore your heart
and you do indeed die,

303
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,690
then before you know it,
we have another

304
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,526
psycho alter ego
case on our hands.

305
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,111
Which is bad.
So give me the ring.

306
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:40,262
This is my ring,
Elena's my sister.

307
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:42,932
No one's going to fight
harder for her than me.

308
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:45,618
Fine. Stubborn.

309
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,820
Try not to kill him.

310
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,040
Look at this.

311
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,075
One big happy
family.

312
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,994
Drink this.

313
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:57,213
It's my blood.
It Bridges us all together

314
00:18:57,215 --> 00:18:59,382
so that when I stop
Jeremy's heart,

315
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,050
you'll have the power
to stop Alaric's.

316
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,118
You need to make a physical
connection to his bloodstream...

317
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,421
a vein, artery,

318
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:07,223
something connected
to his heart.

319
00:19:07,225 --> 00:19:09,926
One of us gets a clean shot,
take it, the other two

320
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,578
hold him down.

321
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,430
Before we all walk
through these doors,

322
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,766
let's get on the same page,
shall we?

323
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,051
I was the one who created
your vampire bloodline,

324
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:21,904
therefore I am responsible
for your lives.

325
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:24,440
And Tyler's life,
Caroline's life,

326
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:26,626
and, of course,
Abby's life.

327
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,444
Should anything
go wrong.

328
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,145
Or you're just lying
to save your ass.

329
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,415
I'm not lying.
Go ahead, call my bluff.

330
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:35,668
Let the teacher kill me.
You'll all be dead soon thereafter.

331
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,621
Let's just get this
over with, shall we?

332
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,212
Why are you doing this?

333
00:19:46,214 --> 00:19:49,182
Because you need me.

334
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:50,516
Because you're an
18-year-old girl

335
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:52,768
without parents
or guidance or any sense

336
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,504
of right and wrong anymore.
Look at you.

337
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:56,806
How is this right?

338
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:58,608
She's a murderer.

339
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,360
She told me she killed
someone and liked it.

340
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:04,197
Now how is
that right?

341
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,282
See, Elena...

342
00:20:06,284 --> 00:20:09,452
Your parents
led the council.

343
00:20:09,454 --> 00:20:12,989
It was their life's mission
to keep this town safe.

344
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:16,492
They weren't dead six months
before you undid it all.

345
00:20:16,494 --> 00:20:18,044
You don't know
anything about them.

346
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:20,329
Why, am I wrong?
Do you actually think...

347
00:20:20,331 --> 00:20:23,099
That they'd be
proud of you?

348
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:30,006
If you don't side
with the humans...

349
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:35,094
You're just
as bad as them.

350
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:40,549
Now kill her.

351
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,068
Or I'll do it for you.

352
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,237
And I'll make it hurt.

353
00:20:55,365 --> 00:20:57,583
I thought I taught you
better than that.

354
00:20:57,585 --> 00:20:59,585
You did.

355
00:21:06,877 --> 00:21:09,378
Get help!

356
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:18,587
It's OK,
it's OK.

357
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:21,607
It's me. It's OK.
You're safe.

358
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,643
We'll save Elena.

359
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:27,947
You go straight home,
you stay inside, you understand?

360
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:31,484
Do you understand me?

361
00:21:32,602 --> 00:21:34,620
Thank you.

362
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:47,717
I should kill you.

363
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,284
I should gut you
like Brian Walters,

364
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:51,286
Bill Forbes
and all the other cowards

365
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:54,590
I plan on ripping apart. You're the
worst offender of them all, Elena.

366
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,925
You don't deserve to live.

367
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:58,561
So then why am I
still alive?

368
00:21:58,563 --> 00:22:00,963
There's obviously
no humanity left in you.

369
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,899
So what's stopping you,
Alaric?

370
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:06,468
If you want me dead,
then kill me!

371
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:08,470
Do it! Kill me!

372
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:22,785
Do it now!

373
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,963
They made contact.

374
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,350
It's happening.

375
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,399
Aaah!

376
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:57,803
What's wrong?

377
00:22:57,805 --> 00:23:00,339
Something happened.
The connection broke.

378
00:23:09,716 --> 00:23:13,869
Stop! Let him go
or I'll kill myself.

379
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,139
Put it down, Elena.
Why?

380
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:19,425
Because you still
need me alive?

381
00:23:19,427 --> 00:23:22,511
There's a reason why Esther used
me to make you, isn't there?

382
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:25,314
She didn't want you
to be immortal.

383
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:29,218
So she tied your life
to a human one... mine.

384
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,320
That way, you have
only one lifespan

385
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:34,490
to kill all vampires,
and then you'll be gone.

386
00:23:34,492 --> 00:23:37,943
So when I die, you die, too.
That's it!

387
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,745
It has to be.

388
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:42,397
You're wrong.

389
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,733
Am I?

390
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:51,540
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

391
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,568
Oh, be careful.

392
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,387
Moving only
makes it hurt more.

393
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:20,557
What are you doing?

394
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,610
Draining you
of all your blood.

395
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,903
Elena?

396
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,239
Tyler! Help me!

397
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:37,658
He can't.

398
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,211
He needs to go fetch me
more empty blood bags.

399
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:42,096
About three liters
worth, please, Tyler.

400
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:43,464
Tyler, please...

401
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:45,299
Get Stefan.

402
00:24:45,301 --> 00:24:46,750
Please.

403
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:50,721
No, Tyler,
get the bags.

404
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:03,267
Forget the girl
and get the bags.

405
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,935
Now.

406
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:20,918
So that's it?

407
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,620
You're just going
to bleed me dry?

408
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,457
Yes. But don't worry.

409
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,276
It'll be completely painless.

410
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,263
As the last drop is drawn,

411
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,982
you'll simply fall asleep.

412
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:50,448
Ugh, why am I
still alive?

413
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,785
Get up.

414
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,010
I said get up!

415
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:06,130
Klaus is going
to kill Elena.

416
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,831
What?

417
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:11,385
What are you
talking about?

418
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:14,438
Klaus needs Elena's
blood to make hybrids.

419
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,673
She's the last person
that he'd kill.

420
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,393
The witch bound
my life to Elena's.

421
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:22,679
If she dies, I die.

422
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,866
Klaus figured that out,
and now he's taken her.

423
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:29,019
Now I'm trapped here
until the sun goes down,

424
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,988
so you two better
get to what you do best...

425
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,991
saving Elena's life.

426
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,801
What about your hybrids?

427
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,221
You'll need more than this
to create your army.

428
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,847
These last few liters
will have to suffice.

429
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,349
You see...

430
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:00,434
By attempting
to kill us,

431
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:03,687
my mother strengthened
the bond between my siblings and I.

432
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:07,057
I don't need hybrids.

433
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,559
I have my family.

434
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:12,847
If you believe that,
then why take my blood at all?

435
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:16,433
You want a back-up family.

436
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:20,904
You know that your siblings
will never trust you again.

437
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:25,359
You know Stefan blames me for
trying to tear him from his brother?

438
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:29,430
But I think we both know
who really came between them.

439
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,515
You.

440
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,435
That's why
you won't choose.

441
00:27:34,437 --> 00:27:36,270
You know once
you pick a Salvatore,

442
00:27:36,272 --> 00:27:38,722
you'll destroy
their bond.

443
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,861
Consider this me
doing you a favor.

444
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:48,265
Once you're dead,
you won't have to choose.

445
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,767
No broken hearts.

446
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,103
Their family
stays intact.

447
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,207
But just
between us girls,

448
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,743
who would you
have picked?

449
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:05,082
Rot in hell.

450
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:06,250
Hmm.

451
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:09,336
You're welcome.

452
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,492
Sweet dreams, Elena.

453
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,478
It's been fun.

454
00:28:50,677 --> 00:28:54,146
What are you doing?
Shh.

455
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:01,587
Tyler...

456
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:08,144
So much for that
sire bond.

457
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,196
I'm not
your little bitch anymore.

458
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,919
How did you break
the sire bond?

459
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,840
By breaking every bone in my body a
hundred times for the girl I love.

460
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,808
That's impossible.

461
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:27,897
Is it? Or maybe real love
is stronger than fake loyalty.

462
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,648
But what would you know
about that?

463
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,050
You know,
you should be thanking me.

464
00:29:32,052 --> 00:29:34,737
I gave you a gift,
I took away your misery.

465
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,156
You didn't give
a crap about me!

466
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:39,441
You just didn't want
to be alone.

467
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:50,402
Good-bye, Tyler.

468
00:30:44,123 --> 00:30:47,309
Hey. Are you OK?

469
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:51,347
Come on.

470
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,538
Oh, my God! Jeremy!

471
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,242
Jeremy!

472
00:32:18,885 --> 00:32:22,521
We should get her home
before the sun sets.

473
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:52,090
Heh. You two are really
going to walk me

474
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:54,008
all the way to the door,
aren't you?

475
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,843
You lost a lot
of blood today.

476
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:57,828
Yeah, I know,
but I told you, I'm fine.

477
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,297
I just... I have
a little headache.

478
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:01,165
Yeah, but the sun's
about to go down

479
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:02,833
and Ric's going to be able to
terrorize the streets any minute.

480
00:33:02,835 --> 00:33:04,719
Yeah, but he can't hurt me.

481
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:07,021
It's you two we should
be worrying about.

482
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,857
He won't be able
to find us.

483
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:16,030
I'll, uh...

484
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:18,149
I'll call you
when we get back.

485
00:33:20,652 --> 00:33:23,488
I know it's selfish.

486
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:29,911
I- I know that it seems like
I'm stringing you both along,

487
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:34,365
but I don't... I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

488
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,667
I mean...

489
00:33:38,036 --> 00:33:41,055
If I choose one of you,
then I lose the other.

490
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:47,145
And I've lost so many
people, I just...

491
00:33:47,147 --> 00:33:50,264
I can't bear the thought
of losing one of you.

492
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:02,710
Ah, it's, uh...

493
00:34:02,712 --> 00:34:05,930
It's been a long day.

494
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,402
We'll call you from the road.

495
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:13,704
After we dump
Klaus' body in the lake.

496
00:34:13,706 --> 00:34:17,575
Just... Be careful.

497
00:34:17,577 --> 00:34:21,763
Both of you.

498
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:50,458
What are you guys
doing here?

499
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
Welcome to our
victory party!

500
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:54,145
What victory?

501
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:56,497
We failed.
Alaric's still out there.

502
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:59,116
We know. But we've been trying
to get rid of Klaus forever

503
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:02,053
and Caroline convinced us
to enjoy it... for a night.

504
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:04,055
Got to be honest...
I'm a little pissed

505
00:35:04,057 --> 00:35:06,924
none of you let me take down
original brother number two.

506
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:09,727
Yeah, he would have taken you
right down to the hospital, bro.

507
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:11,479
Please, I'm more stealth
than that. I'm like a ninja.

508
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:12,930
You wish.
Here.

509
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:16,150
You need this.

510
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:19,970
I heard. And you know
that sooner or later,

511
00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:22,973
you're going to have
to choose, right?

512
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:25,142
I know.

513
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:31,282
Hey. Give me your hand.

514
00:35:32,584 --> 00:35:35,002
Thank you for standing up
to Klaus like that.

515
00:35:35,004 --> 00:35:37,455
Let's just say it's
been a long time coming.

516
00:35:37,457 --> 00:35:40,007
Way too long.

517
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,459
All right, let's drink.

518
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:43,794
I do not condone this,
by the way.

519
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:46,514
You survived Klaus.
All right, make an exception.

520
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:49,267
You can go back to being
responsible tomorrow.

521
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:51,969
OK.
Hang on.

522
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:55,389
Do you guys hear that?

523
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,677
That is the sound
of a Klaus-free life.

524
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:06,484
To a Klaus-free life.

525
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:08,219
And to all of you.

526
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,905
- My family.
- Cheers!

527
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:20,831
Carol. What's so urgent you called
an emergency council meeting

528
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,333
at this hour?

529
00:36:22,335 --> 00:36:25,753
I didn't call
the meeting, Liz.

530
00:36:25,755 --> 00:36:27,388
He did.

531
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,790
Join us, sheriff.

532
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,710
I was just telling the council
about our vampire problem.

533
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,896
Or should I say,
your problem.

534
00:36:34,898 --> 00:36:36,347
What do you think
you're doing?

535
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:37,665
Well, perhaps you
and the mayor can

536
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,567
enlighten the group.
On the strides

537
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,969
you've taken to
eliminate the issue.

538
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:44,572
Oh, that's right...
you haven't.

539
00:36:44,574 --> 00:36:47,191
You see, the sheriff,
the woman we elected

540
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:50,511
to keep our families
safe and town secure

541
00:36:50,513 --> 00:36:53,230
has a vampire
for a daughter.

542
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:57,168
And our lovely mayor,

543
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,105
a son who is
half-vampire,

544
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:02,790
half-werewolf.

545
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,842
Why are you doing this?

546
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:06,060
These women
are hypocrites.

547
00:37:06,062 --> 00:37:07,695
They claim
to spearhead our defense

548
00:37:07,697 --> 00:37:08,863
against a supernatural
presence,

549
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:10,698
then cover up
the violent attacks

550
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,633
committed by their
own children.

551
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:16,420
That's enough. We're done here.
It's time to go.

552
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:18,255
Sit down, Liz.

553
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:23,260
We're just getting started.

554
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:31,702
What?

555
00:37:31,704 --> 00:37:35,573
How many desiccated hybrids does
it take to screw in a light bulb?

556
00:37:37,292 --> 00:37:38,609
You're in a good mood.

557
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,611
Yeah, I'm in a good mood.

558
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:43,781
Klaus is dead,
my brother's halfway sane...

559
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,333
again.

560
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:48,636
Give or take an immortal
hunter that wants to kill us.

561
00:37:48,638 --> 00:37:51,622
We won, Stefan.

562
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:52,956
Come on, say it.

563
00:37:52,958 --> 00:37:54,759
Say it!
We won.

564
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:57,979
Once more, with feeling!

565
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:59,296
We won.

566
00:37:59,298 --> 00:38:02,433
Thank you.

567
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:04,635
No, you know what,
thank you.

568
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:09,073
Turns out we make
a pretty good team, huh?

569
00:38:09,075 --> 00:38:11,492
It only took
a century and a half.

570
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:18,082
What happens when, uh...

571
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:21,151
Elena makes
her decision?

572
00:38:22,671 --> 00:38:26,123
You know how these things
pan out, Stefan.

573
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,626
She'll probably make
a list of pros and cons

574
00:38:28,628 --> 00:38:31,846
and at the end of the day,
dump both our asses.

575
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:35,883
What if she doesn't?

576
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,338
Then she'll pick one of us.

577
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:47,728
Well, if she chooses you...

578
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,365
I'll leave town and let you two be
happy and not be bothered by me.

579
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:58,823
And in 60 years,
we'll go back to being brothers

580
00:38:58,825 --> 00:39:02,359
and none of this will
have mattered, right?

581
00:39:02,361 --> 00:39:04,045
Yeah.

582
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:07,965
Fine.

583
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:12,336
If she chooses you,
I'll... Leave town, too.

584
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:21,562
All this over one girl.

585
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:27,601
She's a pretty
special girl.

586
00:39:27,603 --> 00:39:30,721
Yes, she is.

587
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,251
Hey. Everyone gone?

588
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,921
It's just us.

589
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:51,942
I hate this room.

590
00:39:51,944 --> 00:39:55,262
Me, too.

591
00:39:56,465 --> 00:39:58,883
Mom and dad were right.

592
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:02,520
Alaric should just
kill all the vampires

593
00:40:02,522 --> 00:40:04,638
and put an end
to all of this.

594
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:10,561
But then that means
that Caroline dies.

595
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:13,948
And Bonnie
loses her mom.

596
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,383
The mayor loses her son,

597
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:19,203
and I lose Stefan
and Damon.

598
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:22,957
So if it makes me the bad guy for
wanting to keep those people alive,

599
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:26,710
then fine.
I'll be the bad guy.

600
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:30,381
You forget that Alaric
never wanted any of this.

601
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:32,449
Once he carries out his plans,
what if he decides

602
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:34,752
he doesn't want
to live anymore?

603
00:40:34,754 --> 00:40:38,305
And he kills his human
connection to end his life.

604
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:41,442
That would mean
I would lose you.

605
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:47,148
I'm not going
to let that happen.

606
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:58,141
I'm going to shower
and get some sleep.

607
00:40:58,143 --> 00:40:59,827
Good night, Elena.

608
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,446
Good night.

609
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:46,135
