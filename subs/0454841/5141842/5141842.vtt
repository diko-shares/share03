COMMENTARY:
Hi, I'm Alex Aja, the director.

2
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:10.176
Hi, I'm Greg Levasseur. I'm the
cowriter and I did the art direction.

3
00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.261
This is Marianne Maddalena,
the producer.

4
00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:16.015
One of the three producers,
with Wes Craven and Peter Locke.

5
00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.810
And I'm gonna start by saying that,
you know, it's--

6
00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:22.021
We are so proud to have that logo
in the beginning of the movie.

7
00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.399
It's like, you know, we are coming
from the low-budget world with--

8
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.693
You know, <i>High Tension</i>
was very low budget...

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.490
...and to make a movie
with Fox is amazing. It's great.

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:38.913
So the main idea of remaking
<i>The Hills Have Eyes</i> was to bring...

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.126
...that nuclear-testing background based
on the real facts in New Mexico...

12
00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.294
...and Nevada desert.

13
00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:48.631
So that scene was like....

14
00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:53.970
That didn't came with the first draft
of the script. It came, like, later...

15
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.681
...because were thinking about--
We need--

16
00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.642
As Wes showed
in a few of his movies...

17
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.021
...we need to start the movie
very strongly and very...

18
00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:09.318
...violent and brutal.
And the idea of that sand is like...

19
00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.280
...you know, like walking
the area with Geiger counter...

20
00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:16.075
...and being attacked and
massacred by someone like--

21
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.164
By, like, a ominous silhouette
was pretty exciting.

22
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.249
And unfortunately...

23
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:27.461
...because of the schedule
and because of budget and stuff...

24
00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:29.380
...we were forced...

25
00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:32.425
...to separate ourselves,
and Greg directed the scene.

26
00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.010
Unfortunately for Alex...

27
00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:37.513
...he was very disappointed
when I came back and showed him...

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.893
...the dailies of this scene. And he was
a little bit pissed off to not participate.

29
00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:43.227
[COMMENTATORS CHUCKLING]

30
00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:46.147
Yeah, it was great, because we--

31
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:49.650
We... On that picture,
there was a big second unit...

32
00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:51.694
...and Greg directed
like three weeks.

33
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:55.656
And that scene is the big one,
and it's also the opening one.

34
00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:58.284
And the guy on the screen,
it's also another funny fact...

35
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.786
...is one of our best friends,
he's a French guy.

36
00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:05.666
The first victim, the guy covered with
blood that you saw is, like-- Yeah, it's--

37
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.877
He's our location manager
on the movie.

38
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.712
- Yeah, yeah.
- And your good friend.

39
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.048
And it's-- Yeah, and a very,
very good friend.

40
00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.384
So in this scene, you have to
imagine that there is a big crane...

41
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:20.431
...above the scientist and a cable which
allowed them to be swept into the--

42
00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:25.102
Everything was made with wire and--
So the guy can be hit...

43
00:02:25.436 --> 00:02:27.772
...against the rocks like a rag doll.

44
00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.107
It was very funny.
And you have to imagine...

45
00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:33.736
...the stuntmen who did that,
they had been, like...

46
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:37.657
-...smashed during all the day.
- Yeah, under like 120 degrees.

47
00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.493
With a combination--
I mean, the suit of the scientist--

48
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.746
Yeah, with the scientist suit,
which was, like, so hot.

49
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:51.504
That image, that's a commercial from
the '50s. In fact, it's a short film...

50
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.632
...that I heard David Lynch
is a big fan of that short film...

51
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.468
...because it shows exactly
the kitchen of the future...

52
00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:01.889
...and the idea of how the family...

53
00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:06.686
...was in the U.S. at that time.
And we used the song...

54
00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:09.522
..."More and More."
"More and more I forget my past"...

55
00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.067
...mixing with the nuclear-testing
image and footage.

56
00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:17.613
And that brings the movie
in a kind of nostalgic way...

57
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.285
...but in the same time, you see
some awful stuff coming, like flashes...

58
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.578
...inside the opening-title scene.

59
00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:28.708
I went to Paris to see the movie,
the first cut of the movie.

60
00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:31.919
Alex and Greg came up with
this sequence totally on their own...

61
00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:35.006
...with our editor, Baxter.
We were gonna hire a main title--

62
00:03:35.172 --> 00:03:37.842
People to do the main titles,
and they came up with this...

63
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.427
...and found this footage.

64
00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:45.099
Yeah, and all the pictures that you are
watching in the middle of the--

65
00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:47.852
Of the nuclear-testing footage
are from...

66
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.483
...real footage of all the fallout
and all the nuclear fallout.

67
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.694
And the radioactive fallout can--

68
00:03:56.902 --> 00:04:00.031
Can have a big, big influence
on the genetic and the human being.

69
00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:04.660
Everything is real. Everything is based
on Chernobyl kids...

70
00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.455
...or Hiroshima kids and also some...

71
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:11.334
...which is not radioactive,
like Agent Orange effect in Vietnam.

72
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.837
And we based all the makeup
and all the design of the hills dweller...

73
00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:19.342
...based on those pictures
that you can see in the opening title...

74
00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:21.510
-...which are real.
- All the deformities...

75
00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:24.305
...were based on real mutants.

76
00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:29.101
The good thing with
this opening credit, it's...

77
00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:33.105
It's a way to... Not to teach,
but to say to the audience...

78
00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:39.028
...what's really happened and to make,
like, a really short story about...

79
00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:41.155
...the 30 years of testing and stuff.

80
00:04:41.697 --> 00:04:44.784
It's a way to not, like,
giving too much information...

81
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.913
...but in the same time to be sure
that everyone can understand...

82
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.956
...what is the background
of that movie.

83
00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:55.211
And what were the testing
in the desert in the U.S.

84
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:59.632
And here, it's our tribute to
<i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i>.

85
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.676
I mean, I remember talking
from the beginning...

86
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:07.848
...with Joseph Nemec, the production
designer, and we bring him a lot...

87
00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:11.894
...of reference picture
and reference images...

88
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:14.605
...of gas stations in the desert
and all the details.

89
00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.900
And we bring, like, tons of details
that we wanted to see.

90
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:22.696
And he managed to bring everything
and to build, like, this...

91
00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:25.533
...gas station in the middle
of the desert in Morocco...

92
00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.202
...because we shot the movie
in Morocco. Ouarzazate.

93
00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.206
And the action is supposedly
to take place in New Mexico.

94
00:05:32.373 --> 00:05:38.337
And he managed to build
that exactly American location.

95
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:42.258
And it's not a Western,
but it's open like a Western.

96
00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:47.430
It opens, like, very silent with the
"crink-cronk" of the water wheel.

97
00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:51.892
And there is a kind of mystery.
It was like nobody--

98
00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.187
I mean, everyone wasn't convinced
that that scene...

99
00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:57.898
...was necessary in the movie.

100
00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.902
But for us, it was a way to enter.
Even if we're not following the lead actor...

101
00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:03.988
...or the lead character of the movie...

102
00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:08.826
...it's a way to enter the world
of <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>.

103
00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:13.622
And it has him walking around the gas
station and walking towards the fence.

104
00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.586
Behind which
there is the radioactive...

105
00:06:18.752 --> 00:06:20.629
...testing area.

106
00:06:23.507 --> 00:06:27.011
We went-- First unit
went to do that shot...

107
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:31.474
...and the wind was, like, so strong
and the crane was not working...

108
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.311
...and second unit came back and
did that amazing, amazing shot.

109
00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.189
It's one of my favorite shots
of the movie that Greg did.

110
00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:41.484
- I mean, it's amazing.
- Yeah, but it was easier to do it...

111
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.904
...after-- When you got the reference
of the first shot.

112
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.948
After you know what you
can improve on the shot.

113
00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:50.242
Yeah, and to manage
to have that scorpion...

114
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.994
...like, walking on the rocks...

115
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.871
You have to imagine
there is a guy...

116
00:06:54.038 --> 00:06:58.501
...you know, hidden behind the rock
who frees the scorpion.

117
00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:01.879
And that place is not built.
In fact, we found that location...

118
00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:05.549
...that exact mine-entrance location,
in Morocco.

119
00:07:05.716 --> 00:07:09.762
With even, like--
What's the name of the little chariot--?

120
00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:13.265
- Not the mine shaft, but the--
- Yeah, everything was really here.

121
00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.393
It was all found. Everything--
We found everything just there.

122
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.940
And it's so real. It's exactly the kind of
mine that you can find in New Mexico.

123
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.068
Now, this gas station
still stands in Morocco.

124
00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.903
Yeah, I think they didn't touch it.

125
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.822
And it's on the road of Agadir,
which is another town.

126
00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:32.409
You know, we went really all around
the world to find...

127
00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:37.540
...the best location possible because,
once again, it's <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>.

128
00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:39.959
So the hills are like
one of the lead actor...

129
00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.628
...even like one of the lead
character of the movie.

130
00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.922
Even maybe, like, the lead bad guy.

131
00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:49.134
And everywhere, like--
It were, like, nice places...

132
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:52.763
...but nothing compared to
what Morocco can provide.

133
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.475
What Morocco provides, it's exactly
what you can find in New Mexico...

134
00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.978
...but bigger and...

135
00:07:59.144 --> 00:08:02.189
...even, like, more ominous
and more jagged and more....

136
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:05.818
More original.
Nobody shot where we shot.

137
00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:08.404
And it's funny because
during the prep, we mixed...

138
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.365
...some picture of New Mexico
and Morocco and nobody...

139
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:14.535
...could be able to make
the difference between the--

140
00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:17.121
- Both of them.
- Yeah, both of them.

141
00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.918
So it was a big challenge for Joseph
Nemec, the production designer, to....

142
00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:27.089
To bring that feeling of....

143
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:32.303
That so strong feeling of U.S. here
in the desert in Morocco, of course.

144
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:35.431
And, you know, I think it's....

145
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.059
After that scene, you don't
even wonder where it's taking place.

146
00:08:39.226 --> 00:08:41.979
It's taking place in New Mexico
around, like, Santa Fe.

147
00:08:42.146 --> 00:08:43.480
It's true, you can--

148
00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:46.233
Around Santa Fe,
you can find the same kind of colors...

149
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.362
...the same kind of vegetation, exactly
the same kind of hills, mountain...

150
00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:54.867
...canyon. It's the same geology, exactly.

151
00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:57.870
And when we were
writing the script...

152
00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:01.790
...we decided to keep that idea of
starting with a character...

153
00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:07.254
...like the gas-station attendant
and then having the Carter family...

154
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:10.341
...stop by to pour some gas.

155
00:09:10.507 --> 00:09:12.635
And that's very interesting
because in--

156
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:16.347
The obvious way to make
that kind of movie is to start...

157
00:09:16.513 --> 00:09:19.975
...the story with them in the car
and following them to the gas station.

158
00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:24.813
Here it's the opposite.
You present all the character...

159
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.524
...in one scene,
which is not so easy to do.

160
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.402
And it's another way to tell the story.

161
00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:34.156
And it's very interesting because nobody
knows who is going to follow them.

162
00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:35.491
That was a tricky part...

163
00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:39.203
...because you have to present
very quickly seven characters...

164
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.914
...in the same time and so....

165
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:46.251
Yeah, and all the relationships
between them, you know?

166
00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:49.630
Because the idea was to try
to develop all the characters...

167
00:09:49.838 --> 00:09:52.174
...and to make them exist
and to understand them.

168
00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:55.678
Because the more you feel for them,
the more you will scare for them also.

169
00:09:55.844 --> 00:09:59.848
DOUG: Your parents can't stand me.
- No, you're wrong. They love you.

170
00:10:00.015 --> 00:10:01.850
I could have taken them on a cruise.

171
00:10:02.059 --> 00:10:03.102
You know what? Stop.

172
00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:06.980
COMMENTARY: So shooting in
a trailer is pretty, pretty hard.

173
00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:10.150
So the only way, because--
Even an Airstream is very small.

174
00:10:10.317 --> 00:10:15.531
So we rebuilt the trailer,
the Airstream trailer, on-stage...

175
00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:20.077
...and we asked Joseph Nemec
to build the same exact trailer...

176
00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:22.496
...but, like, 30 percent bigger.

177
00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:27.084
So it was more easy for us to move
with the camera and shoot inside.

178
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:32.089
At the same time, you have to take care
to not show that the trailer is bigger...

179
00:10:32.297 --> 00:10:34.550
...so that was also a little bit tricky.

180
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:38.595
Yeah, but even me, like, you know,
after making the movie...

181
00:10:38.762 --> 00:10:42.307
...I just forgot that everything
wasn't made in the same time.

182
00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:45.436
For me, they are inside,
like, trying to fix the a.c.

183
00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:47.813
Well, also, the air conditioning
on the stage...

184
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.190
...and inside the trailer
wasn't working.

185
00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.443
So it was hotter inside than outside.

186
00:10:52.609 --> 00:10:54.737
It was about 130 degrees
inside that trailer.

187
00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:57.531
Yeah, even when we were on-stage,
it was, like, so hot.

188
00:10:57.698 --> 00:11:01.034
I mean, you know, it's common sense.
You don't shoot in the desert...

189
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:03.120
...during July-August.

190
00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:06.123
And because of production reasons,
and many reasons...

191
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.837
...the shooting was delayed to exactly
July-August in the Sahara desert.

192
00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:14.339
Which is pretty hot.

193
00:11:14.506 --> 00:11:17.718
Pretty hot, and sandstorm every day.

194
00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:20.137
- Every day at the same time.
- Three o'clock.

195
00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:22.765
Yeah, 3:00, sandstorm.

196
00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:24.767
- So that was--
- It was brutal. Hot.

197
00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:28.187
- It was really hot and brutal, yeah.
- Six days a week.

198
00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:31.064
The other tricky part,
and it's the same in New Mexico...

199
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:35.861
...is the color of the hills. It's so
different. You can find pink, red...

200
00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:39.823
...yellow, ochre. I mean, you can really
find all the different kind of colors.

201
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.992
And for the DP, it's a big challenge.

202
00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:45.037
And I think Maxime Alexandre,
our DP...

203
00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.706
...did, like, an amazing job,
because he managed...

204
00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:51.251
...to make everything look not the same,
but belong to the same place...

205
00:11:51.418 --> 00:11:54.671
...even if we are not shooting
exactly in the same place each time.

206
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:01.929
And behind the trailer,
you can see in the distance...

207
00:12:02.095 --> 00:12:07.351
...some remains of another location
built for another movie.

208
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.853
For, like, an Italian TV show...

209
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.232
...like, years ago, they didn't touch
also on the road to Morocco.

210
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.735
So I guess in a few years,
in Ouarzazate, on that road...

211
00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.737
...coming from Ouarzazate to Agadir...

212
00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.532
...you'll find different location
from different movie.

213
00:12:21.698 --> 00:12:25.244
It's going to be like
a little Hollywood in the desert.

214
00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:28.038
BOBBY:
Thanks, Brenda.

215
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:31.625
COMMENTARY:
That's, like, some chicken meat with fly...

216
00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:33.043
...and everything was real.

217
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.504
So you have to imagine
after two days--

218
00:12:35.712 --> 00:12:38.006
Yeah, the smell. The smell was awful.

219
00:12:38.173 --> 00:12:41.552
It was just impossible to come, like...

220
00:12:41.718 --> 00:12:45.556
- That was so disgusting.
-...less than 5 meters from the outhouse.

221
00:12:45.722 --> 00:12:47.266
Yeah.

222
00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:50.686
Talk about this baby.
How did we find her?

223
00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:51.979
The baby save us.

224
00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:56.024
Without Maisie, the baby,
the little girl, we'd be dead.

225
00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:59.611
Maisie comes from Malta. We searched
everywhere for the right baby.

226
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.115
We couldn't find a baby that
matched the family in Morocco.

227
00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:06.994
Yeah, it was impossible. And it was very
hard, also, to bring a baby from U.S.

228
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.997
And because of the heat, the desert,
the condition...

229
00:13:10.163 --> 00:13:16.128
...it was so, so difficult.
So we were lucky that...

230
00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:20.340
...one crew member have, like, her best
friend coming on vacation in Morocco...

231
00:13:20.507 --> 00:13:24.761
...and bring the baby and the parents--
The parents accept--

232
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.015
Agree on letting their daughter,
which was like...

233
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:30.642
-...she was 6 months old--
- Yeah, 6 months old...

234
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:34.730
-...work in the desert.
- Yeah, usually on movie, they--

235
00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.398
Usually on movies, they....

236
00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.400
- You find twins.
- Yeah, you find twins.

237
00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:42.362
And that was the case.
And she was so good. Maisie is--

238
00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:45.073
- She is amazing.
- She was just a doll. She was a gem.

239
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.951
She was so good,
her acting was wonderful...

240
00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:50.120
...she was never grouchy,
she never cried.

241
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.788
Exactly. It was, like, amazing.

242
00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:54.583
And everyone was
so in love with her on set.

243
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.878
She was like-- She really
brings something to the movie.

244
00:13:58.045 --> 00:14:01.089
She brings a very strong reason
for the quest at the end.

245
00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:04.593
You really care for her.
It's-- She's amazing.

246
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.013
She's amazing. I'm really looking
forward to the day where...

247
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.308
...a young girl is going to come and say,
"You know what? I was the baby...

248
00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:14.895
...in <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>."
I'm sure it's going to happen.

249
00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:19.650
We had a great time with her parents.
They were really good troupers.

250
00:14:19.816 --> 00:14:22.569
- And we all had a great time on the set.
- Yeah.

251
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.531
But, I mean, the baby is one thing...

252
00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:29.076
...but all the cast
on that movie were, like....

253
00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:31.411
It was very-- It was a long run...

254
00:14:31.578 --> 00:14:34.748
...it was a long process to find
everyone and to be sure...

255
00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:38.168
...that everyone was able
to play so extreme situation.

256
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:42.172
But, you know, being in Morocco
with them and being in...

257
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:46.551
...a kind of survival condition,
as they are in the movie...

258
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.846
...showed that we
were exactly correct.

259
00:14:50.013 --> 00:14:51.723
I mean, everyone's great.

260
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.850
We were stuck
in the middle of nowhere.

261
00:14:54.017 --> 00:14:56.728
And we worked six days a week
and we had one hotel.

262
00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:59.523
And we basically hung out
with each other all the time.

263
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.483
- And we survived.
- And we survived.

264
00:15:03.568 --> 00:15:05.070
- Ted Levine.
- Yeah.

265
00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:07.864
- Kathleen.
- Kathleen Quinlan.

266
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:10.158
And we got Vinessa Shaw.

267
00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:14.454
And I mean, you know,
Aaron and Dan are, like, amazing.

268
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:18.917
I mean, you know, everyone is great.
And all the hills dweller also...

269
00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:22.879
...are very, very impressive because
they are, like, also acting...

270
00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:24.589
...with prosthetics and makeup.

271
00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:28.844
And they're like, 100 degrees
and 120 degrees sometimes...

272
00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:32.139
...which is, like--
Make the makeup melt.

273
00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:35.684
BOB: Yeah?
- You know...

274
00:15:35.934 --> 00:15:36.977
...it's not on--

275
00:15:37.144 --> 00:15:38.895
COMMENTARY: This is Tom Bower.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:42.524
Great job as the gas-station attendant.
Wonderful actor.

277
00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.944
And also, the heat of the place
where we were shooting...

278
00:15:46.111 --> 00:15:47.946
...is also not so easy
for the light...

279
00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:52.492
...because the heat changed the light.
When it's too hot, it became, like...

280
00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:56.747
...impossible to see the horizon
or to see-- It become very hazy.

281
00:15:56.955 --> 00:15:59.875
So that's why also we decided
to do a lot of split days...

282
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.668
...which was not so easy.

283
00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:04.629
Because we were, like,
shooting afternoon and then night.

284
00:16:04.796 --> 00:16:07.591
Going against the continuity
of the movie and the script--

285
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.303
So that was a big challenge. Everything
was a big challenge on that movie.

286
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.139
Particularly on this shot,
because this shot, we got--

287
00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:16.767
So once again, the crane broke...

288
00:16:16.933 --> 00:16:19.603
...so we were supposed to have
a big crane shot, like...

289
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.480
...leading to that point of view...

290
00:16:21.646 --> 00:16:24.941
...and then crane down
on the gas-station guy...

291
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.610
...watching them go and--

292
00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:31.114
Just broken, and the sun was, like,
setting behind the hill, so it was like....

293
00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:34.367
We were, like, 15 minutes
before night...

294
00:16:34.534 --> 00:16:37.621
...and the next day we have
to move to another place.

295
00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:42.876
So we did that traveling shot,
that pulling on him--

296
00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:44.544
That pushing on him.

297
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.171
--And it was only one take.

298
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.380
Yeah, only one take...

299
00:16:47.547 --> 00:16:50.801
...because it was very difficult
for the trailer to make a U-turn...

300
00:16:50.967 --> 00:16:53.470
-...so they need, like, 20 minutes to--
- To get back.

301
00:16:53.637 --> 00:16:56.807
So it was really, like, one shot,
one opportunity.

302
00:17:00.602 --> 00:17:04.606
That was supposed to be
the first binoculars POV...

303
00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:08.860
...from the hills on the trailer arriving.

304
00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:12.739
And in the editing room,
we decided to stay....

305
00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:15.200
You know, to not imply
the binoculars yet.

306
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.411
But, in fact, we got a lot of shots
of the trailer passing by...

307
00:17:18.578 --> 00:17:22.415
...and going to this pass.
And during the editing...

308
00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:25.127
...we realized that it was impossible
to have this--

309
00:17:25.293 --> 00:17:28.130
- To use everything.
- To use everything of this long trip.

310
00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:33.927
That-- All that scene
was made in different--

311
00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:36.847
Like, in one hand,
we used the poor-man process...

312
00:17:37.013 --> 00:17:42.894
...which is like, basically, some grips
moving the car with a wind machine.

313
00:17:43.103 --> 00:17:46.898
But that specific part of the scene,
when they're on the road...

314
00:17:47.107 --> 00:17:52.654
...and Ted was really driving the car
with the genny on the hood of the car...

315
00:17:52.821 --> 00:17:56.658
...and he was also doing the....
Slight?

316
00:17:57.033 --> 00:17:59.661
- The slate? Yeah, the slate.
- The clacker, the slate.

317
00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:01.163
Himself, with two cameras.

318
00:18:01.329 --> 00:18:03.707
But on each side of the road,
there is a canyon...

319
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.835
...so it was, like, pretty dangerous,
and he was so good.

320
00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.254
And we are lucky.
And if you watch carefully...

321
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.716
...it's funny because the sun is setting
on both sides of the car.

322
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:17.470
So it's funny. You don't feel that,
but you can really see it.

323
00:18:17.637 --> 00:18:22.267
Here it's a good example of
how to shoot on-stage...

324
00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:26.229
...and feeling that you are also outside.
Of course, we are on-stage here...

325
00:18:26.396 --> 00:18:29.232
...and what you saw by the window
was made by second unit...

326
00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:33.528
...and then add in CGI
by Jamison Goei.

327
00:18:34.487 --> 00:18:37.449
And so you have the feeling that
you are, like, on the road...

328
00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:43.246
...and it sold the idea of
the trailer being the real trailer.

329
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:48.001
BOBBY:
There. It's just the thermostat.

330
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:51.755
- It was disconnected.
- Anyway...

331
00:18:51.922 --> 00:18:54.007
...at least we can breathe now.

332
00:18:58.345 --> 00:19:01.223
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

333
00:19:01.431 --> 00:19:02.849
Does my sister know?

334
00:19:03.016 --> 00:19:06.895
COMMENTARY: I love the dynamic
between Doug and Bobby.

335
00:19:07.103 --> 00:19:13.026
You really feel that Bobby is torn
between his vision of his father...

336
00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:16.154
...which is like the....
You know, the patriarchal figure...

337
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.990
...the father figure,
the Republican figure...

338
00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:22.869
...and his brother-in-law, which is
the cool guy, a little bit coward.

339
00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:27.457
And he really doesn't know yet
who's going to-- Who he wants to be.

340
00:19:27.624 --> 00:19:29.584
DOUG:
--would cut my nuts off if you started.

341
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:32.629
I think she did that a long time ago.

342
00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.464
I think you're right.

343
00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:37.342
COMMENTARY:
The place.

344
00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.928
I mean, I remember the first time
we arrived on that road...

345
00:19:40.095 --> 00:19:44.891
...which is an old mining road
closed for years now in Morocco.

346
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:47.560
And we found the place
and we had the feeling...

347
00:19:47.727 --> 00:19:50.230
-...that it was waiting for us.
- The funny thing...

348
00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:52.732
...that the first place,
in fact, that we found.

349
00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:54.609
We came from Marrakech...

350
00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.820
...and 50 kilometers
before Ouarzazate...

351
00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:00.532
...we say, "Now we can start to scout."
And that's the place that we found.

352
00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.910
Yeah, and nobody shot before here,
and it's so perfect.

353
00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:08.873
It's 360 degrees of nothing,
no civilization, no town...

354
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.628
...nothing built, just hills
and rocks and canyon.

355
00:20:13.795 --> 00:20:15.839
And it's amazing.
And when we came back...

356
00:20:16.006 --> 00:20:21.136
...like, for the following scouting,
we found all the canyon behind...

357
00:20:21.303 --> 00:20:24.014
...and we found, like,
places that we use in the movie...

358
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:28.018
...when he's looking for the dog
and when they are fighting at the end.

359
00:20:28.184 --> 00:20:30.520
And everything was there,
really waiting for us.

360
00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:35.567
Like, you can walk from a set
to the other one.

361
00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.361
It's amazing.
It's full of rattlesnakes.

362
00:20:38.528 --> 00:20:42.866
Not rattlesnakes, but full of
scorpions and desert snakes.

363
00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:44.868
Cedric did a great job with that stunt.

364
00:20:45.035 --> 00:20:47.120
- Our stunt coordinator.
- Yeah, yeah, Cedric.

365
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.955
- First time.
- First time, exactly.

366
00:20:49.122 --> 00:20:51.541
- First-time stunt coordinator.
- Going way too fast.

367
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.543
- But that's great.
- Exactly, it worked.

368
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.878
On-screen, it's amazing.

369
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:57.088
And what he did
with all the fight stuff...

370
00:20:57.255 --> 00:20:58.673
- Incredible.
-...it's amazing.

371
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.385
It was his first, really, job
as a supervisor...

372
00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:04.721
...and he did, like, something
which is...

373
00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:08.350
...beyond everything we can have
with an old guy.

374
00:21:08.516 --> 00:21:10.935
Most of the time,
we didn't have a lot of time...

375
00:21:11.102 --> 00:21:14.189
...so it's always working, like,
almost with one take.

376
00:21:14.356 --> 00:21:15.857
Yeah, he really nailed it.

377
00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:18.777
On this scene, by example,
he didn't have a lot of choice.

378
00:21:18.943 --> 00:21:22.113
- We got just one car, so....
- Exactly, you've got one shot at it.

379
00:21:22.322 --> 00:21:27.702
Yeah, we came from-- And we bring,
like, two SUVs from France, that's it.

380
00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:32.040
And the two SUVs were, like,
not working so well either.

381
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:35.710
A lot of disasters with that one.
The gas tank was on the wrong side.

382
00:21:35.877 --> 00:21:38.421
Yeah, more and more,
you forget your past...

383
00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:41.966
-...like the song in the opening title.
- Exactly.

384
00:21:42.133 --> 00:21:46.012
You just keep the good memories and
forget that everything was not so easy.

385
00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:48.431
- Everything was a challenge.
- Yeah, everything.

386
00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:52.644
Everything become more difficult in the
desert because of the wind, the sand.

387
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.481
I mean, for all the equipment,
camera and stuff, light...

388
00:21:56.689 --> 00:21:58.191
...it's very, very hard.

389
00:21:58.358 --> 00:22:01.694
It's incredible how the actors
just were so good with all the weather.

390
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:04.656
- We never had any problems.
- I have a theory that--

391
00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:08.243
I think the fact
that they were so in hard condition...

392
00:22:08.827 --> 00:22:13.748
...that really helped them to find all
the good behavior for their characters...

393
00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:18.628
...because they were in
the same exact condition...

394
00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.880
-...as the character in the story.
- Exactly.

395
00:22:21.047 --> 00:22:23.716
They were, like, stuck
in the middle of the desert...

396
00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:27.679
...with, like, you know, like,
little bit of water and heat.

397
00:22:27.887 --> 00:22:31.099
And so they were, like,
just living as they are.

398
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.143
Yeah, it was perfect.

399
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.939
They all had a great time. All the actors
talk about what a great time they had.

400
00:22:38.106 --> 00:22:41.025
Yeah, and that was-- You know,
because it was very intense...

401
00:22:41.192 --> 00:22:45.238
...and we were all living together in
the same hotel in the same place...

402
00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:46.948
...and with the crew members--

403
00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:49.117
Because it was not only
an American crew...

404
00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:51.786
...it was people coming
from all around the world...

405
00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.914
...from South Africa, from Romania,
from Italy, from France...

406
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:56.666
...from Thailand, from England...

407
00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:59.461
-...from Australia.
- I think we had 18 different nationalities.

408
00:22:59.627 --> 00:23:03.298
Yeah, it was just amazing.
And everyone, like, really bonded.

409
00:23:03.506 --> 00:23:04.841
Yeah, really bonded.

410
00:23:05.008 --> 00:23:07.552
- It was amazing.
- We actually had a great time.

411
00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:11.306
There was another movie
staying at the hotel.

412
00:23:11.473 --> 00:23:14.142
Another shoot was at the hotel,
for <i>The Ten Commandments</i>.

413
00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.436
- And then the Brad Pitt movie earlier.
- Yeah.

414
00:23:16.603 --> 00:23:18.563
It was fun,
like a small little world.

415
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.233
The only thing which was....
Everything was quite hard...

416
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.612
-...but the dogs were like a nightmare.
- The dogs were a challenge.

417
00:23:25.778 --> 00:23:28.406
The dogs were a nightmare
because, of course...

418
00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.618
...you can't make the dog work all day.
They have to work very--

419
00:23:31.784 --> 00:23:35.288
Like, a short time because it's so hot
that it's very hard for them.

420
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:39.375
So even with the heat,
to have trained dogs, it's very hard...

421
00:23:39.542 --> 00:23:42.921
...because, you know,
they just care about, you know, heat.

422
00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:46.382
Yeah, you can still ask to an actor
to make some effort.

423
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:49.594
The dog, it's impossible. After
two takes, he doesn't want to do it.

424
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:50.803
[COMMENTATOR CHUCKLING]

425
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.307
That song, "California Dreamin',"
was a long one.

426
00:23:54.474 --> 00:23:57.810
Was a big, big fight
also to get that.

427
00:23:57.977 --> 00:24:01.898
Because we wanted a song that
everyone in the family can listen to...

428
00:24:02.065 --> 00:24:04.609
...and just make the scene like
everything is fine.

429
00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:08.446
You know, it's only an accident, you are
stuck in the middle of the desert...

430
00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:12.200
...but you're still in U.S. It's not
a problem, they're used to do that.

431
00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:16.913
They can spend the night here,
they have water, they have food.

432
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.668
So everything is fine, you know. It's not
like, "Okay, we are starting to panic.

433
00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:25.046
And we are trying
to count the bullets we have...

434
00:24:25.213 --> 00:24:26.923
...and we're going to--" You know.

435
00:24:28.258 --> 00:24:30.718
Right now, it's okay.
Everything's fine.

436
00:24:30.885 --> 00:24:33.555
Even if you know that
it wasn't an accident.

437
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.474
BOB: it makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

438
00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:39.519
I don't think so.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

439
00:24:39.727 --> 00:24:41.312
You know, he's right.

440
00:24:41.854 --> 00:24:44.148
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

441
00:24:46.192 --> 00:24:48.945
COMMENTARY:
That scene, where he's looking at...

442
00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:50.154
Brenda.

443
00:24:50.321 --> 00:24:55.368
Yes, Brenda, and his wife is
watching him looking at her...

444
00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:58.580
...was like--
We were really, like, asking...

445
00:24:58.746 --> 00:25:01.749
...wondering if we have to
keep that scene in the editing...

446
00:25:01.916 --> 00:25:06.421
...because we cut one scene where she
was talking about that later on by night.

447
00:25:06.588 --> 00:25:09.591
Lynn was asking her husband
if he still found her attractive.

448
00:25:09.799 --> 00:25:12.594
Yeah, and we cut that for a reason...

449
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.638
...because the scene was
a little bit too long.

450
00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:19.684
But we kept that look between--
And it's very funny because people--

451
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.353
- They love that moment.
- Yeah, they love that moment.

452
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.189
- People disagree on that.
- They relate to it.

453
00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:27.525
They are expecting something else,
you know...

454
00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:30.403
-...that something is coming after.
- You know, I mean...

455
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.280
- You never know.
- His wife is dead...

456
00:25:32.447 --> 00:25:34.365
-...he has to start a new life.
- Exactly.

457
00:25:34.532 --> 00:25:36.576
Maybe with his wife's sister.

458
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:41.080
- You know, I never thought about it.
- Yeah, but that's a good ending.

459
00:25:41.247 --> 00:25:43.958
They have the baby
and they can be together.

460
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:46.252
I think she's 18,
so I think they'll be okay.

461
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:47.670
Yeah.

462
00:25:48.212 --> 00:25:49.964
He can wait.

463
00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:55.136
That's the only scene that we shot
in the trailer, in location, in fact.

464
00:25:55.303 --> 00:25:58.890
Yeah, some of the point of view
from inside, outside, also--

465
00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:01.559
- When you see the trailer...
- When you see, exactly--

466
00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:04.937
-...inside and outside, it was very--
- You can feel in that shot...

467
00:26:05.104 --> 00:26:10.693
...that it's not the same scale
than the other scene.

468
00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.904
That's an easy jump.
That worked very well.

469
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.491
- But it's very, like--
- It's very easy, but it's good.

470
00:26:16.658 --> 00:26:18.951
What is funny,
they used that for the trailer...

471
00:26:19.118 --> 00:26:22.080
...as the start of the attack.
And that works very well.

472
00:26:22.246 --> 00:26:25.583
And her looking through the shade
looks great too. It's very scary.

473
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:29.087
And there is no window. You can see
that there is no window, in fact.

474
00:26:29.253 --> 00:26:31.381
- So it's totally fake.
- A big cheat.

475
00:26:31.547 --> 00:26:34.175
Yeah, but that's good.
That worked very well.

476
00:26:34.342 --> 00:26:36.010
Everything is about cheat. I mean--

477
00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:39.514
What is funny is,
even when you are, like--

478
00:26:39.722 --> 00:26:42.475
When you are guilty
because you did the cheat...

479
00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:45.520
...and you are watching the movie,
and you just forgot that.

480

You're just watching the movie
as everything was made...

481
00:26:48.564 --> 00:26:50.608
...exactly as it is on-screen.

- You need the hat.

483

- It gives me hat head.

I love that moment where, like...

486
00:27:02.453 --> 00:27:05.248
...he stopped him
to kissing his daughter.

487
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:08.501
You really feel that he's, like,
the jealous father.

488
00:27:08.668 --> 00:27:12.380
Ted Levine is great because he brings
so much detail like this...

489
00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:14.382
...in the movie for his character.

COMMENTARY: He's amazing. He's
amazing. He really brings something...

493
00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:24.934
...to Big Bob Carter.
It wasn't so easy to play...

494
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:28.312
...because Big Bob can be a clichÃ©,
and he's never a clichÃ©.

495
00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:32.483
And he can be also a big asshole, and
Ted brings sympathy to the character.

496
00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.820
Yeah, you really care for him.
You really have the feeling that...

497
00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:41.117
...he's going to-- The one who's going to
save the day and to make them survive.

498
00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:42.952
And it's not the case.

499
00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.329
Another detail for Ted.

500
00:27:45.496 --> 00:27:48.958
Yeah. This is great because
Doug Bukowski, his son-in-law...

501
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:53.421
...is not Christian. He's, like, Jewish.

502
00:27:53.588 --> 00:27:57.592
And he's taking the hat off his head
when they start making the prayer.

503
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.261
Which, you know, is really
something that you can--

504
00:28:00.428 --> 00:28:04.056
You have to watch the movie
a few times to get that detail.

505
00:28:04.223 --> 00:28:07.059
But that's what is great.
From the beginning, the idea was to...

506
00:28:07.226 --> 00:28:10.563
...try to make
the most real survival possible.

507
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:15.401
Even if we are dealing with, you know,
radioactive cannibal mutants.

508
00:28:15.568 --> 00:28:20.031
It's not that. It's about, like, this family
stuck in the middle of desert...

509
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.450
...facing something
unknown in the hills.

510
00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:24.786
And the idea was really
to make that...

511
00:28:25.119 --> 00:28:28.790
...as real as we can.
So every scene was, like....

512
00:28:28.956 --> 00:28:32.168
You know, like, feelers
in that direction.

because they are picnicking outside...

...and everything looks fine...

519
00:28:49.727 --> 00:28:53.231
...and everyone looks very happy,
and even the baby is breastfeeding.

520
00:28:53.397 --> 00:28:58.611
Which is-- It's not the baby.
It's, like, a fake baby...

521
00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:01.405
...moving. You know, like,
with battery.

522
00:29:01.572 --> 00:29:03.741
- Animatronic doll.
- Yeah, animatronic doll.

523
00:29:03.908 --> 00:29:06.118
- Broke, like--
- Broke every five minutes.

524
00:29:06.285 --> 00:29:08.704
Every five minutes, with someone
with the remote...

525
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:11.207
...making the movement of her head.

526

"You know, everything is good.

527
00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:16.754
We are, like, having lunch."

528
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.550
But this scene was shot with, like,
I don't know...

529
00:29:20.716 --> 00:29:27.056
...like, 50 miles wind by hours.
It was like a huge sandstorm.

530
00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:32.270
- It looks like a small breeze here, but--
- It's really big. It's really big. It's really--

531
00:29:32.436 --> 00:29:35.273
We almost thought we couldn't shoot.
We almost had to stop.

532
00:29:35.439 --> 00:29:37.608
- We managed--
- A lot of times, it looked like--

533
00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:39.485
But we never did, and it looks fine.

534
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:41.654
We'd only stop when there was really...

535
00:29:41.821 --> 00:29:45.408
...like, a dust devil on top of us,
and we'd all stop for about 10 minutes.

536
00:29:45.575 --> 00:29:51.581
No, no. Except for the story
of when we built the test village--

537
00:29:51.747 --> 00:29:53.416
- The construction crew.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:56.836
- When they--
- Yes, it was sandstorm, very hard one...

539
00:29:57.003 --> 00:30:01.632
...but never, never, like....
You know, strong enough for us--

540
00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.718
To stop shooting
other than just to wait.

541
00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.720

- We're tough.

I'm sorry. I apologize to the table.

LYNN:
Well, thank you.

546
00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:17.732
I'm really glad that we all came
on this trip together.

547
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:20.318
Well, that makes one of us.

548
00:30:23.529 --> 00:30:25.907
COMMENTARY: And all the scenes
were a big challenge...

549
00:30:26.073 --> 00:30:27.658
...because I wanted to keep time...

550
00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:31.370
...to build the tension
and to make all the suspense...

551
00:30:31.537 --> 00:30:35.666
...and all the scary scene more,
you know, like....

552
00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:38.878
You know, more elaborate
in the directing point of view.

553
00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:43.007
So we decide to really make
all the dialogue scenes, like...

554
00:30:43.174 --> 00:30:46.677
...five, six, eight pages a day
of dialogue.

555
00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:48.971
And that was a big challenge also.

556
00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:52.308
Just to.... And a lot of film stock.

557
00:30:52.475 --> 00:30:55.519
A lot. We shot double
what we thought we'd shoot.

558
00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:58.648
Yeah, and you freaked out.
I mean, everyone freaked out.

559
00:30:58.814 --> 00:31:01.984
Because I gave, at the beginning,
like, an average of film stock.

560
00:31:02.151 --> 00:31:05.655
And, of course, because we are doing
all the dialogue in a short time...

561
00:31:05.821 --> 00:31:09.033
-...we were like double the average.
- Yeah.

562
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.869
- It's worth it. It's worth it.
- Yeah, and at the end...

563
00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.205
...we came back to the average.

564
00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:18.751
- At the end, we came back to average?
- Yeah, first unit came back on average.

565
00:31:18.918 --> 00:31:20.753
- Oh, it was second unit's fault.
- Yeah.

566
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.505
Sorry for that.

567
00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:24.840
I have to deal with animals.
It's not so easy.

568
00:31:25.007 --> 00:31:28.052
I do think we used double the amount
of any Disney director.

569
00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:29.887
Someone told me that statistic.

570
00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.807
I'm proud of that statistic.

571
00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.643
That was also a big challenge
because that crane shot...

572
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.020
...is made, really,
in the middle of desert.

573
00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:40.606
So Greg was shooting all that scene.

574
00:31:40.773 --> 00:31:43.943
And that's two different locations.
That's the crash site...

575
00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:46.404
...but just the labyrinth of rock before...

576
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.824
...and the labyrinth of rock
you are going to see after was made--

577
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:54.036
Two different locations
with, you know, camera crew...

578
00:31:54.203 --> 00:31:57.039
...and grips bringing the crane.

579
00:31:57.206 --> 00:32:00.960
Because it was very important that
even in desert, even in the rocks...

580
00:32:01.127 --> 00:32:03.879
...we wanted to keep the....

581
00:32:04.046 --> 00:32:06.507
You know, like, not high-class,
I would say...

582
00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:09.802
...like, big movement.
Big aerial movement.

583
00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:12.680
It was meant to be done
by the first unit...

584
00:32:12.847 --> 00:32:15.975
...but because of schedule time,
we have to do it on second unit.

585
00:32:16.142 --> 00:32:17.727
And I think it was...

586
00:32:17.893 --> 00:32:19.603
- It was good.
-...a good solution...

587
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.065
...because with the second unit,
it's really a small crew, so it's--

588
00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.401
- You're able to move very fast and--
- Yeah.

589
00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:29.530
And you have, like,
a day and a half to do that scene.

590
00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:32.742
And first unit was supposed to do it
with half a day, which is--

591
00:32:32.908 --> 00:32:34.702
You know, it's a big difference.

592
00:32:41.834 --> 00:32:46.172
And unfortunately we had to cut
part of the scene...

593
00:32:46.338 --> 00:32:51.218
...where, like, Bobby was supposed to
meet Ruby, the little girl from the hills.

594
00:32:51.385 --> 00:32:54.013
And we cut that because it was
another day of shooting.

595
00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.140
It was very hard.

596
00:32:56.307 --> 00:32:57.850
But that works better like that.

597
00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.935
- More mysterious.
- She's more mysterious.

598
00:33:00.102 --> 00:33:02.021
And it wasn't really believable...

599
00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:05.524
...that Bobby don't talk about
this meeting with Ruby with his family.

600
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:09.028
- In the hills, that's true.
- So at the end we cut it, at the editing.

601
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.530
We kept it until the very last minute,
didn't we?

602
00:33:11.697 --> 00:33:14.742
- Yeah, very last minute.
- We lost that scene at the last minute.

603
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:17.536
- For time.
- Yeah, Laura Ortiz, Ruby's character...

604
00:33:17.703 --> 00:33:20.414
...was disappointed because
that was her really awesome--

605
00:33:20.581 --> 00:33:22.416
That's a great, great lighting moment.

606
00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:25.294
You have the shadow in the background,
but then you can--

607
00:33:25.461 --> 00:33:27.963
You still have the backlit
of the sun behind him.

608
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.051
It's really, like--
It's detail, but it's very nice.

609
00:33:34.929 --> 00:33:38.724
We were so lucky with the stunt.
Here is another example.

610
00:33:38.933 --> 00:33:43.187
You know, Cedric, the stunt coordinator,
did a so amazing job.

611
00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:46.357
And that stunt was made, like,
in 20 minutes.

- Yeah, Florian.

613
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:52.947
He's Doug--
How do you say, body double?

614
00:33:53.114 --> 00:33:54.990
- Body double.
- Yeah. Doug's body double.

615
00:33:55.157 --> 00:33:58.369
- He was injured, as well, on that.
- Yeah. He was Bobby, Doug....

616
00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:00.704
- Yeah, exactly.
- He was Big Bob on the tree.

617
00:34:00.871 --> 00:34:02.998
- That's right.
- Was a scientist also.

618
00:34:03.165 --> 00:34:06.085
He was injured in the big jump
at the end of the movie.

619
00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:08.754
- But he still did this stunt for us.
- Yeah.

620
00:34:08.921 --> 00:34:11.215
And here it's, like--
It's also interesting.

621
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:15.344
It's the first time that you see Ruby,
which is a very specific character...

622
00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:18.347
...because she's the only one
made in CG, and not--

623
00:34:18.514 --> 00:34:22.685
With the disformation of her face made
in CG and not with prosthetics makeup.

624
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:25.312
That was a big challenge
because nobody did that before.

625
00:34:28.732 --> 00:34:32.486
It's another challenge because in the scene
you see another hills dweller...

626
00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:35.489
...like, you know, crouching
on top of the rock.

627
00:34:35.656 --> 00:34:39.285
And he's backlit, so you don't see him,
but you have to see...

628
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:43.164
...little glimpses of his face.
So, yeah....

...in ADR he sung, like,
10 different songs...

637
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.938
...like, from the gospel to the....

638
00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.941
We didn't know if we could
afford it, but finally we could.

639
00:35:11.108 --> 00:35:13.527
To "the bottle of beer on the wall,"
and all stuff.

640
00:35:13.694 --> 00:35:17.865
It would be funny to present
all the scene with different songs.

641
00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:21.368
And that came from, like....

642
00:35:21.535 --> 00:35:24.079
The first production designer
that can be available...

643
00:35:24.246 --> 00:35:25.748
...because of schedule reason.

644
00:35:25.915 --> 00:35:29.084
We find half of a canyon
and the guy said:

645
00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:33.088
"With just half of the canyon,
you can do the real crater.

646
00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:36.675
It's very easy, and it's
much more doable for the CGI."

647
00:35:36.842 --> 00:35:40.095
And that's exactly what we found.
We found just half of the crater.

648
00:35:40.262 --> 00:35:44.433
And then Jamison Goei,
with Rez-illusion, built the other side.

649
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.604
But that was a big deal also,
to find vehicles from U.S.

650
00:35:48.771 --> 00:35:54.109
From, like, the....
Let's say the '70s to until today.

651
00:35:54.276 --> 00:35:57.321
And all the cars were found
in Morocco, Casablanca.

652
00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:01.533
And everything came by, you know,
truck and stuff.

653
00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.869
And they were actually
very expensive to rent.

654
00:36:04.036 --> 00:36:05.913
- It was very expensive.
- Very expensive.

655
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.082
It was maybe
only one day of shooting...

656
00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:10.668
...and it's maybe one of the most
expensive sets...

657
00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.169
-...on the film.
- Definitely.

658
00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:15.589
But that was good because
that location bring, really, something....

659
00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:18.592
Like a <i>Twilight Zone</i> feeling
to the movie.

660
00:36:18.759 --> 00:36:21.262
- Absolutely.
- They are talking about that scene...

661
00:36:21.428 --> 00:36:24.223
...in the original film,
but they are not showing it.

662
00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:27.434
And at the end,
we asked Jamison...

663
00:36:27.601 --> 00:36:30.771
...to add some blood
on the other side of the door also.

664
00:36:30.938 --> 00:36:32.022
Just to make it, like--

665
00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:34.942
He can't see the blood,
but there is something wrong here.

666
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:38.612
As the barbed wire
around the wheel on the left.

667
00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:41.699
- And I remember the--
- And here you can see...

668
00:36:41.865 --> 00:36:45.411
...the fishing pole in the boat.
The one that he's going to pick up...

669
00:36:45.577 --> 00:36:47.538
...and bring back to his family.

670
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.581
One of the first meetings
that we got...

671
00:36:49.748 --> 00:36:52.126
...with Marianne Maddalena
and Wes Craven...

672
00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:55.379
...was to talk about ideas
for this remake.

673
00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:57.548
And the crater was one of the ideas.

674
00:36:57.715 --> 00:37:01.218
I mean, as soon as we found the idea
of the nuclear-testing background...

675
00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:03.929
...everything came very easy,
like the test village...

676
00:37:04.096 --> 00:37:08.684
...the look of the people from the hills
and the crater and everything.

677
00:37:09.351 --> 00:37:12.813
And I remember I had the idea
of bringing the crow and the raven--

678
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.775
Like, it was during prep.
It wasn't before in the script...

679
00:37:16.942 --> 00:37:22.865
...to bring, like, the crow as
another element of something....

680
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:24.366
- Ominous.
- Yeah, ominous.

681
00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:27.202
- Something is going wrong here.
- Deadly, yeah.

682
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.165
That shot was, for CGI,
the most hard one to do.

683
00:37:31.332 --> 00:37:33.834
I don't know why, you know.
There is always one shot.

684
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:37.171
And I think we tried
like 15 different times.

685
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:40.049
At the end it's good.
It's not, like, really perfect...

686
00:37:40.215 --> 00:37:43.344
...but it's working very well.
The idea where we enter...

687
00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:46.513
...and then making the transition
to the night.

688
00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:53.270
That's-- That's a shot that we did
on the roof of the hotel during prep.

689
00:37:53.437 --> 00:37:57.024
That's exactly--
The moon shot was made...

690
00:37:57.191 --> 00:37:59.860
...during prep before everything.
That's the first shot.

691
00:38:00.027 --> 00:38:02.363
We were, like, at the pool
and we saw the moon...

692
00:38:02.529 --> 00:38:05.157
...and we said, "Yeah, we have
to pick up the camera...

693
00:38:05.324 --> 00:38:08.494
...and come back and go on the roof
and shot that." And we did it.

694
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.996
It was two days
before we started the main shoot.

695
00:38:11.163 --> 00:38:13.082
I remember you guys
going up with Maxime.

696
00:38:13.248 --> 00:38:15.542
- It was even before, like a week.
- Yeah, a week.

697
00:38:15.709 --> 00:38:17.711
Just when we received
the camera, in fact.

698
00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:18.921
- Yeah, yeah.
- Exactly.

699
00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:20.756
The camera just arrived and we...

700
00:38:20.923 --> 00:38:24.385
- You ran out and got--
- Like a toy. Like the day after Christmas.

701
00:38:24.551 --> 00:38:27.638
-"Let's go."
- Yeah, "Let's play."

702
00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.434
David Franco,
the music supervisor...

703
00:38:32.601 --> 00:38:36.271
...found that song,
"In the Valley of the Sun"...

704
00:38:36.438 --> 00:38:38.857
...which is amazing,
that we use at the end.

705
00:38:39.024 --> 00:38:42.277
Because of Mark,
our editor assistant...

706
00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.988
...put that in the editing
and it was great.

707
00:38:45.155 --> 00:38:47.491
It brings something.
It's like "More and More."

708
00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:52.204
It's like a reminder of that country music
that just, you know...

709
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:54.998
Talk about, like, another time,
another...

710
00:38:55.165 --> 00:38:57.626
- Things were more positive.
- Yeah.

711
00:38:57.793 --> 00:39:00.087
- But almost too positive.
- Too positive.

712
00:39:00.254 --> 00:39:01.855
- Too good to be true.
- Yeah, exactly.

713
00:39:01.922 --> 00:39:04.508
BOB: I got some water, all right?

714
00:39:13.475 --> 00:39:15.978
COMMENTARY: And everything here,
all that scene, was shot...

715
00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:18.230
...the two last days of the shooting
by night.

716
00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:21.233
So we already did that.

717
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.527
And here we were, like,
in the middle of the night.

718
00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:26.572
At the end of the night,
and the sun was coming.

719
00:39:26.738 --> 00:39:30.659
And it was just, like, half an hour,
one hour to do it.

720
00:39:30.826 --> 00:39:33.245
So the only solution...

721
00:39:33.412 --> 00:39:38.792
...was to separate. So I was, like--
I'm operating the camera here.

722
00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:43.547
And in the other room,
Maxime is doing the other camera.

723
00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:45.215
And we are shooting
in the same time.

724
00:39:45.382 --> 00:39:48.427
It's only, like, one-take shots.

725
00:39:48.594 --> 00:39:53.390
So, in fact, we are following him
from one room to the other room.

726
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:55.434
And it's funny.

727
00:39:55.601 --> 00:39:58.228
It was the only way,
because you already can see...

728
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.315
...the daylight coming outside
by the window.

729
00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:03.442
Those were the last shots
of the movie.

730
00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:07.738
- In Ouarzazate, yeah.
- In Ouarzazate, exactly.

731
00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:18.582
What I like is, like, Maxime Alexandre,
our DP, did something...

732
00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:22.211
...which is he developed really what he
did on <i>High Tension</i>, our previous movie.

733
00:40:22.377 --> 00:40:28.509
He really built around the contrast
between warm and cold light.

734
00:40:28.675 --> 00:40:32.221
In every shot by night,
you can really feel the very heat...

735
00:40:32.387 --> 00:40:35.557
...of, like, yellow, orange, red light.

736
00:40:35.724 --> 00:40:41.855
And in the other hand, you have, like,
the blue, cyan, green light of the night.

737
00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:44.775
And everything is always
in the opposition...

738
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.735
...and backlit. It's never flat.

739
00:40:46.902 --> 00:40:48.445
He really works with the contrast.

740
00:40:48.612 --> 00:40:52.407
And I think that's what makes
an horror movie a good horror movie.

741
00:40:52.574 --> 00:40:54.493
It's when you really
play with the contrast.

742
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.247
Contrasts in silence and sound,
contrasts in between emotions.

743
00:40:58.413 --> 00:41:01.208
Contrast between light, of course.

744
00:41:01.375 --> 00:41:05.128
And everything.
Everything is about the contrast.

745
00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:08.131
There's Alix Taylor in that photograph.

746
00:41:08.298 --> 00:41:12.511
- Yeah, Alix Taylor, exactly.
- Who's our exec in charge of production.

747
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:14.513
She volunteered
to be the mutants' mother...

748
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.015
...and then volunteered her daughter
to be a baby mutant.

749
00:41:17.182 --> 00:41:18.976
Exactly.

750
00:41:28.443 --> 00:41:29.778
BOB:
Yeah.

751
00:41:32.864 --> 00:41:33.991
[ENGINE STALLS]

752
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:37.369
ATTENDANT:
Jupiter.

753
00:41:39.788 --> 00:41:43.667
I got a buckshot, you hear?

754
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:45.794
Hey, mister.

755
00:41:49.214 --> 00:41:52.217
COMMENTARY: This was a controversial
scene with the MPAA, wasn't it?

756
00:41:52.926 --> 00:41:54.761
- That scene, yeah.
- The scene coming up?

757
00:41:54.928 --> 00:41:57.931
- Didn't we get a lot--?
- Yeah, yeah, the committing suicide.

758
00:41:58.098 --> 00:41:59.474
The MPAA was...

759
00:41:59.641 --> 00:42:01.852
As the audience were, like,
very shocked...

760
00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.104
...of the way we show--

761
00:42:04.271 --> 00:42:06.315
The gas-station attendant
blowing his head off.

762
00:42:06.481 --> 00:42:10.402
Exactly. It was so real.
And we are very proud of that effect.

763
00:42:10.569 --> 00:42:13.947
Because, in fact, it's not so simple.

764
00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:16.450
On one hand, you have the actors
playing the scene...

765
00:42:16.617 --> 00:42:18.160
...and putting the gun under his chin.

766
00:42:18.327 --> 00:42:22.164
And then you have a puppet
of the actors very close.

767
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:24.333
And you have to lock the position
of the camera...

768
00:42:24.499 --> 00:42:26.543
...and then you do
just a simple morphing...

769
00:42:27.127 --> 00:42:30.797
...between the real actor
and the dummy.

770
00:42:30.964 --> 00:42:32.299
And the result is fantastic.

771
00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:35.177
You really have the feeling
that he's, like, shooting himself.

772
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:37.846
JUPITER:
Daddy.

773
00:42:38.472 --> 00:42:40.891
COMMENTARY: I love that shot.
You really have the feeling...

774
00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.976
...that he is, like, shooting
to the audience.

775
00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:44.811
Shooting towards the audience.

776
00:42:44.978 --> 00:42:46.313
And all the voices, of course...

777
00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.815
...like, all the actors,
were not here when we did that.

778
00:42:48.982 --> 00:42:51.526
And so it was, like,
PA doing the voices.

779
00:42:51.693 --> 00:42:53.695
That was very funny.

780
00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:55.906
That was very funny.

781
00:42:56.365 --> 00:42:57.866
JUPITER:
Daddy.

782
00:42:59.284 --> 00:43:02.829
COMMENTARY: This is a really scary
scene because Big Bob is so scared.

783
00:43:03.288 --> 00:43:06.708
Yeah, and he is the guy
who's not supposed to be scared.

784
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.086
And that shot of Jupiter
in the rear-view mirror...

785
00:43:09.252 --> 00:43:11.963
...was made by second unit,
like, two weeks before.

786
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.174
- Without the car.
- Without the car.

787
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:17.010
Just, like, two pieces of glass
in the back and the front...

788
00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:19.680
-...and the rear mirror. That's it.
- Yeah, and all the dummy--

789
00:43:19.846 --> 00:43:22.265
Because we did the scene
with Ted Levine...

790
00:43:22.432 --> 00:43:23.975
...being smashed against the window.

791
00:43:24.142 --> 00:43:29.856
But also with, like, a very good dummy
by K.N.B. against the windshield.

792
00:43:30.023 --> 00:43:33.485
And that second unit did that
the next day or the following day.

793
00:43:33.652 --> 00:43:36.822
- Yeah, the following day.
- The following day, yeah, on-stage.

794
00:43:36.988 --> 00:43:38.323
That's also second unit.

795
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.160
On-stage, Joseph Nemec
built, like, a part of the mine.

796
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:51.336
And the lamp, the gas lamp
that they're using...

797
00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:53.547
...I found that in a souk...

798
00:43:53.714 --> 00:43:57.968
...in a market over there in Morocco.
It's a really miner sodium lamp.

799
00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:01.972
- Amazing. Did you keep it?
- No, the guy refused to sell it.

800
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.850
- Oh, so you just borrowed it?
- Yeah, yeah. Just for the scene.

801
00:44:05.475 --> 00:44:08.311
BRENDA: Wait, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

00:44:11.857 --> 00:44:13.817
COMMENTARY:
Everyone thought that I was crazy...

803
00:44:13.984 --> 00:44:15.902
...to think about that shot here...

804
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:18.280
...because it was very hard to access.

805
00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:20.991
And I wanted to have a crane shot
starting on the landscape...

806
00:44:21.158 --> 00:44:24.494
...and then craning down in the canyon
where they were.

807
00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:27.289
And that was not only
impossible to do...

808
00:44:27.456 --> 00:44:30.792
...it was impossible
just to reach the place with the crane.

809
00:44:30.959 --> 00:44:34.713
So for one whole day,
grips were, like...

810
00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:39.426
...bringing the crane on their shoulder
to the place...

811
00:44:39.593 --> 00:44:42.596
...just to make that shot possible.

812
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:44.681
- But it works very well.
- Yeah, it's great.

813
00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:46.600
You get this feeling of vertigo.

814
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.778
ETHEL: Okay, let me just--
Oh, honey, the hair.

815
00:44:58.111 --> 00:44:59.237
BOBBY:
Just....

816
00:44:59.404 --> 00:45:02.532
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

817
00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:06.870
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

818
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.164
COMMENTARY:
Here you can feel that the trailer--

819
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:11.416
Even if you put, like, everyone
in the same frame...

820
00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:13.835
...just to make the trailer
a little bit more small...

821
00:45:14.002 --> 00:45:18.006
...but you can see that the trailer
is very big. You can really feel that.

822
00:45:19.382 --> 00:45:21.802
LYNN: But we heard something.

823
00:45:21.968 --> 00:45:23.678
Some sort of breathing.

824
00:45:23.845 --> 00:45:25.680
What breathing?

825
00:45:27.307 --> 00:45:28.850
COMMENTARY:
This scene was shot also...

826
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:31.728
...but we decide to cut it
during the editing room.

827
00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.039
- Yeah, yeah.
- The scene where she's talking about--

828
00:45:34.105 --> 00:45:37.192
They are talking about the CB
and what they heard on the CB.

829
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:39.402
And we cut the scene
because, I mean...

830
00:45:39.569 --> 00:45:42.155
...we are talking about what's happened,
and we don't need that.

831
00:45:42.322 --> 00:45:46.368
We were with Bobby
and with Big Bob, so...

832
00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:51.456
So, you know, it was not very
helpful to understand.

833
00:45:51.623 --> 00:45:54.000
I think we get exactly
what's going on.

834
00:45:56.795 --> 00:45:59.381
We also decided to apply
what we did on <i>High Tension</i> here...

835
00:45:59.548 --> 00:46:02.509
...which is according to the level
of fear of what we are filming...

836
00:46:02.676 --> 00:46:05.554
...you change the way
you are filming, you know.

837
00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:08.014
It's more hand-held
when you are really scared.

838
00:46:08.181 --> 00:46:12.561
And it's more, like, high aerial and steady
when it's, you know, just about...

839
00:46:12.727 --> 00:46:15.355
...like, confident, and when you
are with the bad guy...

840
00:46:15.522 --> 00:46:19.067
...or when it's just about, like,
tension and suspense.

841
00:46:24.155 --> 00:46:26.157
BOBBY:
Beast!

842
00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:27.534
- Beast!
DOUG: Hey, Bobby.

843
00:46:27.701 --> 00:46:29.661
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey, whoa!

844
00:46:30.036 --> 00:46:32.914
Stop pointing the gun at me. Please.

845
00:46:33.623 --> 00:46:36.585
- Jesus, Bobby.
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

846
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:38.587
It's me.

847
00:46:39.546 --> 00:46:41.840
COMMENTARY: I love the look of Doug
with his hat...

848
00:46:42.007 --> 00:46:43.675
...and his, like, you know, jacket.

849
00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:46.761
He looks so, like, not the hero.

850
00:46:46.928 --> 00:46:49.764
You really can't-- You know,
you can't bet on him.

851
00:46:49.931 --> 00:46:53.143
- Yeah.
- He won't-- He won't survive.

852
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.937
He's going to die.
He's not going to be the hero.

853
00:46:56.104 --> 00:46:59.649
Also, I think it's--
What is great with Aaron Stanford...

854
00:46:59.816 --> 00:47:02.569
He's really, like-- You know,
people during the test screening...

855
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:06.615
...were, like, giving who is
their favorite character in the movie.

856
00:47:06.781 --> 00:47:08.783
And they were all saying,
"Doug at the end."

857
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.578
And the least favorite was
"Doug at the beginning."

858
00:47:11.745 --> 00:47:13.079
- Exactly.
- That was great.

859
00:47:13.246 --> 00:47:15.498
- That show that the arc is here.
- They loved it--

860
00:47:15.665 --> 00:47:17.834
What they said is they loved it
when Doug "manned up."

861
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.336
- Remember?
- Yeah.

862
00:47:19.502 --> 00:47:22.088
That's really about--
We were looking, like...

863
00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:25.258
...the new Dustin Hoffman
in <i>Straw Dogs</i> for that movie.

864
00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:27.844
And Aaron Stanford is just perfect.

865
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:30.221
Yeah, he was great.
He understand very quickly.

866
00:47:30.388 --> 00:47:35.226
And he was very open to do this
coward character at the beginning.

867
00:47:35.393 --> 00:47:37.228
To play the antihero.

868
00:47:37.395 --> 00:47:40.607
And to go very deep in that process.
So that was great.

869
00:47:40.774 --> 00:47:43.026
Here you can really see also the....

870
00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:45.070
You know, Maxime, an excellent job.

871
00:47:45.236 --> 00:47:49.866
Because in one hand, you have
really, like, the heat of the campfire...

872
00:47:50.033 --> 00:47:51.868
...and in the other hand
you have the night...

873
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:56.790
...and the opposition between
heat and cold light.

874
00:47:56.957 --> 00:48:00.460
That's a day-for-night.
That's the only one we did.

875
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:05.966
It was at the end of the day
of the labyrinth scene with Bobby.

876
00:48:06.132 --> 00:48:08.510
We did that with the dog.
It was just one take.

877
00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:11.930
And did it perfectly
for the first time in the shooting.

878
00:48:12.597 --> 00:48:15.517
DOUG: No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

879
00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:18.436
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

880
00:48:18.603 --> 00:48:20.480
Because I'll sleep on the floor.

881
00:48:20.647 --> 00:48:23.316
Mom and Brenda will be up front,
you and Lynn in back.

882
00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:25.568
We got extra sleeping bags
and stuff too.

883
00:48:25.735 --> 00:48:30.031
Bobby, you got six people sleeping in a
three-person trailer. It's not comfortable.

884
00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:32.659
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

885
00:48:32.826 --> 00:48:34.411
Honey, you gonna bring the water?

886
00:48:34.577 --> 00:48:37.247
COMMENTARY: We also did a lot
of rehearsal before the shooting...

887
00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:41.084
...with all the actors,
just to be sure of the blocking.

888
00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:44.713
DOUG: Baby, you coming?
LYNN: I'm almost ready.

889
00:48:45.296 --> 00:48:47.215
What's going on?

890
00:48:48.883 --> 00:48:52.637
COMMENTARY: And Bobby's character
was one of the....

891
00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:56.182
Hard character to find.

892
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:58.560
I mean, Dan Byrd came in the room
and really showed...

893
00:48:58.727 --> 00:49:00.353
...that he was really the character.

894
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.272
But with all the Bobby
that we saw before...

895
00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.649
-...it wasn't so....
- So easy.

896
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:07.819
He has to be young, but in
the same time he needs to be, like...

897
00:49:07.986 --> 00:49:12.574
Big strength inside him.
Even if he can cry...

898
00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:16.536
...even if he can be very, you know,
emotive and sensitive...

899
00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:20.331
...he needs to be the one
that gets out for revenge first.

900
00:49:20.498 --> 00:49:26.713
He is the one that's going to
motivate Doug to become the hero.

901
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.965
And he has also to express
his feelings...

902
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:33.178
...that he knows that something
is going wrong here.

903
00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:38.058
And he can't tell to the people,
and he really managed to express that.

904
00:49:38.224 --> 00:49:40.602
Oh, Emilie. We haven't really
talked at all about Emilie.

905
00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:42.203
- Yeah, Emilie--
- She was amazing.

906
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:46.066
She was amazing. And, you know,
we met a lot of young actresses...

907
00:49:46.232 --> 00:49:48.026
...but she came very early...

908
00:49:48.193 --> 00:49:51.696
...and she became, like,
the only possibility.

909
00:49:51.863 --> 00:49:53.114
She came in the room...

910
00:49:53.281 --> 00:49:55.325
...and played back to back
three different scenes...

911
00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.535
...without even, like,
a pause or break.

912
00:49:57.702 --> 00:50:01.623
And it was, like, you know,
normal life, screaming and crying.

913
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.459
And back to back,
it was just super real...

914
00:50:04.626 --> 00:50:10.340
...to see her go in such extreme emotion
in so short of time.

915
00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:15.887
She's one of the best young actresses.

916
00:50:16.054 --> 00:50:19.224
Even, maybe, the best.
I mean, she's amazing.

917
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.813
And we put her through it.
She really got bloody, got out up....

918
00:50:24.979 --> 00:50:27.148
Yeah, she got cut up.
She got, like, a-- Well, yeah--

919
00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:29.359
She went through the story for real.

920
00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.653
- She was seriously-- Yeah.
- For real.

921
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:37.659
Because some of the hills dweller
are, like, really violent in life.

922
00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:45.208
I think she had about 200 little cuts
at one point on her arm...

923
00:50:45.375 --> 00:50:47.252
-...from the candy glass.
- Yeah, maybe not 200.

924
00:50:47.418 --> 00:50:49.420
No, little teeny-tiny--
She was a trouper, though.

925
00:50:49.587 --> 00:50:50.922
Yeah.

926
00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:53.716
I remember here
we put some silhouettes...

927
00:50:53.883 --> 00:50:58.513
...of Doug and Lynn inside the SUV.

928
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.348
But you can't see them at all.

929
00:51:00.515 --> 00:51:03.143
Like, pretending to make love
or something like that.

930
00:51:03.309 --> 00:51:06.855
They are here. They're, like, you know,
the PA, pretending to make love.

931
00:51:07.021 --> 00:51:09.649
Who was that?
That was Olivier and Miriam.

932
00:51:09.816 --> 00:51:12.944
- Exactly.
- Exactly. Olivier got all the good jobs.

933
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:15.446
Our second assistant director.

934
00:51:15.613 --> 00:51:18.074
He held the umbrella
over Brenda as well...

935
00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.076
-...when she was in her bra top.
- Yeah.

936
00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.370
- Exactly.
- He had the hard jobs.

937
00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:29.043
This shot is funny.
It remembers, like, <i>High Tension</i>.

938
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.422
Yeah, it's really like a tribute
to <i>High Tension</i>. Same shot.

939
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:35.425
With the hand coming in the frame,
with the same:

940
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.221
"Whoosh." Like, "boom."

941
00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:42.265
Exactly the same.

942
00:51:44.559 --> 00:51:46.060
It was a hard decision to take.

943
00:51:46.227 --> 00:51:48.605
When we're going to show,
for the first time...

944
00:51:48.771 --> 00:51:51.232
...the face of Pluto.
Are we waiting her to wake up?

945
00:51:51.399 --> 00:51:53.484
Or are we, like, showing him, like...

946
00:51:53.651 --> 00:51:57.739
...enjoying the vision of her, like,
naked body, under the sheets?

947
00:51:58.406 --> 00:52:00.617
In the original movie,
we can see Pluto, you know...

948
00:52:00.783 --> 00:52:05.205
-...taking out the gas from the car.
- Siphoning the gas.

949
00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:08.499
- And we shot that.
- We shot that...

950
00:52:08.666 --> 00:52:12.003
...but we decided to cut it off because
it was more scary...

951
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.589
...to have Pluto's face here...

952
00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:16.758
-...for the first time.
- For the first time, yeah.

COMMENTARY: And that's also
one of the reasons I remember...

956
00:52:25.767 --> 00:52:28.144
...we were talking
with the line producer about.

957
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:31.898
Like, why we wanted to shoot the movie
outside by night...

958
00:52:32.065 --> 00:52:33.608
...for real and not on-stage.

959
00:52:33.775 --> 00:52:38.696
It's because, even by night,
we refuse to not see....

960
00:52:38.863 --> 00:52:41.699
To not only see the trailer,
but see also the landscape.

961
00:52:41.866 --> 00:52:44.118
It was very important
to keep the landscape...

962
00:52:44.285 --> 00:52:47.538
...part of the location all the time.

963
00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:51.668
So everything was made
on location by night.

964
00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:54.337
Which is not the case
in the usual films.

965
00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:57.257
You know, it's not very easy
to go into the desert by night...

966
00:52:57.423 --> 00:53:01.261
...with, like, 100 people and shoot.

967
00:53:01.928 --> 00:53:06.474
And once again, scorpions and snakes
are, like, everywhere.

968
00:53:06.641 --> 00:53:10.228
And nighttime is when
they really live their life.

969
00:53:10.395 --> 00:53:13.273
So we told everyone that,
you know:

970
00:53:13.439 --> 00:53:14.941
"If you have to give a phone call...

971
00:53:15.108 --> 00:53:18.111
...or if you have to rest,
or I don't know what...

972
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:20.613
...don't go out of the light,
because...."

973
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:23.866
"Don't sit on a rock."  There were
rocks everywhere and it was really dark.

974
00:53:24.033 --> 00:53:26.202
- It's amazing no one fell over.
- Yeah.

975
00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:29.080
- It was definitely....
- It was cool to shoot during night.

976
00:53:29.247 --> 00:53:31.457
That was the only moment
we can breathe a little bit.

977
00:53:31.624 --> 00:53:34.002
- And to have the temperature go down.
- Exactly.

978
00:53:34.168 --> 00:53:37.547
And it was so beautiful,
all the stars in the sky.

979
00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:41.175
I mean, I'm going to have
my romantic moment.

980
00:53:41.342 --> 00:53:43.094
- It was really amazing.
- It was gorgeous.

981
00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:47.849
So that shot is made on production.
It's a Steadicam shot...

982
00:53:48.016 --> 00:53:51.436
...that we then apply
a variation speed on it.

983
00:53:51.602 --> 00:53:56.482
And Ted Levine was really on the tree,
like, yelling and screaming.

984
00:53:56.649 --> 00:53:59.944
And we add then the flames
and the fire.

985
00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:01.821
But because of the variation speed...

986
00:54:01.988 --> 00:54:06.367
...we had to have him play slow motion.
Like, six-time slow motion.

987
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:07.869
And he did it perfectly.

988
00:54:08.036 --> 00:54:10.997
You have to imagine also
the Steadicam operator...

989
00:54:11.164 --> 00:54:13.333
...who walked during, like, two minutes
to reach him.

990
00:54:13.499 --> 00:54:16.544
Yeah, it's-- The whole shot in real time,
it's, like, two minutes' walk.

991
00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:18.046
Two minutes' and a half walk.

992
00:54:18.212 --> 00:54:21.549
Which is a big, big, big deal
for a Steadicamer.

993
00:54:24.969 --> 00:54:28.848
It's funny how that guy is, like,
enjoying by dressing him in a skirt.

994
00:54:29.932 --> 00:54:34.479
- It's the first time we see Lizard.
- And so-- Yeah, and Big Bob on fire...

995
00:54:34.645 --> 00:54:38.066
...was made from all the different
kind of processes you can have.

996
00:54:38.274 --> 00:54:41.569
In one hand, you have, like,
really Ted Levine on the tree...

997
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:44.947
...like, pretending to burn.
And then you add, like, the CGI.

998
00:54:45.114 --> 00:54:48.117
You have, like, part of his body,
like here.

999
00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.620
That's really him with CGI.

1000
00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:53.915
- And then you have, like, a dummy.
- CG and makeup also.

1001
00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:57.585
CG and makeup, yeah,
because you see the skin bubbling.

1002
00:54:57.752 --> 00:55:00.046
- A moving dummy, articulated dummy.
- And a moving...

1003
00:55:00.213 --> 00:55:02.173
...articulated dummy
that we put fire on it.

1004
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:04.050
- Yeah.
- So it was just one take.

1005
00:55:04.217 --> 00:55:07.887
Because after, like,
20 seconds of fire...

1006
00:55:08.054 --> 00:55:11.057
...the dummy stopped working.
Of course, because it's burning.

1007
00:55:11.224 --> 00:55:14.852
And two close-up shots of
Big Bob burning, the arm and the head.

1008
00:55:15.019 --> 00:55:18.398
That's one of the shot that the MPAA
asked us to cut because it was--

1009
00:55:18.564 --> 00:55:21.275
- It was pretty intense.
- Pretty intense, and....

1010
00:55:21.442 --> 00:55:24.904
So the bird, the same. The bird was,
like, of course, a fake bird.

1011
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:26.155
Yes, of course it was.

1012
00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:28.491
Yeah, and the actor refused
to eat a real one.

[COMMENTATOR CHUCKLES]

1014
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.578
And so it was, like, really one take...

1015
00:55:32.745 --> 00:55:36.374
...and, like, three cameras,
like, running everywhere.

1016
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:37.917
And it was like, "Okay, guys.

1017
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:41.796
Do exactly how you feel
the shot with different lenses."

1018
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.132
And we have some great material.

1019
00:55:44.298 --> 00:55:47.051
Because it looks real, it looks
really like a guy burning...

1020

like, freaking out around him.

COMMENTARY: Michael Bailey Smith,
who's playing Pluto...

1023
00:55:57.145 --> 00:55:58.771
...is amazing because....

1024
00:55:59.313 --> 00:56:04.735
The job of Greg Nicotero and K.N.B.
is one of the best jobs they have made.

1025
00:56:04.902 --> 00:56:08.531
It's amazing how the makeup
looks real on them.

1026
00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:10.283
But the way he acts...

1027
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:14.829
...and the way he brought, like, his own
interpretation of the character...

1028
00:56:14.996 --> 00:56:17.039
...to Pluto is amazing.

1029
00:56:17.206 --> 00:56:18.958
It's very strong.

1030
00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:21.794
It was a big challenge
because everyone remembers...

1031
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:25.256
...Michael Berryman in the original film
in the part of Pluto.

1032
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:31.429
So it was a big deal to make it, like,
you know, like, different...

1033
00:56:31.596 --> 00:56:34.765
...and in the same time as strong
as it was in the original film.

1034
00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:40.271
And Michael did, like, something that--
I mean, beyond all the expectation.

1035
00:56:41.063 --> 00:56:45.443
And he became really
our favorite hills mutant.

1036
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.617
Yeah, that's my assistant's hand
out the window, like...

1037
00:56:53.117 --> 00:56:54.952
...touching the--
You know, the blinds.

1038
00:56:55.119 --> 00:56:57.705
That was shot like a week before.

1039
00:56:57.872 --> 00:57:00.583
- She's doing very well, the raping.
- Oh, my God.

1040
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:02.835
- I mean, it's--
- She does. She does a great job.

1041
00:57:03.002 --> 00:57:05.922
Now, all this wardrobe was--
The big story about the wardrobe:

1042
00:57:06.088 --> 00:57:08.132
That all of the key mutant wardrobe
was lost...

1043
00:57:08.299 --> 00:57:10.760
...three days before
we were about to shoot.

1044
00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:13.763
The shipment from L.A.
never arrived...

1045
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.766
...so we had to re-create everything
within three days.

1046
00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.267
- And we did.
- Yeah.

1047
00:57:18.434 --> 00:57:20.311
It was the worst day--
The second-worst day...

1048
00:57:20.478 --> 00:57:22.939
...of my producing career
when I realized that--

1049
00:57:23.105 --> 00:57:24.440
- It really was.
- Yeah, I mean--

1050
00:57:24.607 --> 00:57:26.317
I just couldn't believe it happened.

1051
00:57:26.484 --> 00:57:28.903
I couldn't believe I had to tell
Alex and Greg it happened.

1052
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.239
Luckily someone told you
before I had to.

1053
00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:33.741
But we did it.
We got it together...

Anna Lombardi in Ouarzazate...

COMMENTARY:
All the hills' costumes, in fact...

1060
00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.470
...because all the Carter family
arrived, in fact.

1061
00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:57.139
Yeah, it was all the Hills--
it was all the mutants.

1062
00:57:59.433 --> 00:58:03.271
Which had taken months to design,
build and age. Months.

1063
00:58:03.437 --> 00:58:06.482
- It's amazing what she did.
- Yeah, it was incredible.

1064
00:58:06.649 --> 00:58:09.652
That's another shot
that the MPAA asked us to change.

1065
00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:12.196
Change our focus on the baby
and the gun.

1066
00:58:12.697 --> 00:58:17.243
But what is funny is, like, if you look
at all the dailies of that scene...

1067
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:20.955
...you know, you see that the baby
is really enjoying the gun.

1068
00:58:21.122 --> 00:58:22.790
You know, she just doesn't care.

1069
00:58:22.957 --> 00:58:25.001
Nothing--
Blood didn't bother that baby.

1070
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:29.755
And what's funny is, like, you can't
do a fake Magnum, silver...

1071
00:58:29.922 --> 00:58:32.216
...because it's very hard
and it looks fake.

1072
00:58:32.383 --> 00:58:35.303
And so before each shot
you have the mother of the baby here...

1073
00:58:35.469 --> 00:58:37.888
- Checking the gun.
-...and you have to present the gun...

1074
00:58:38.055 --> 00:58:40.808
...and so she's opening the gun,
looking inside, there is no bullet:

1075
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.519
"Okay, you can play
with my baby and the gun."

1076
00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:45.021
- It was crazy.
- Oh, my gosh.

1077
00:58:45.187 --> 00:58:49.358
Yeah, and it was very hard because
we did in first unit some of the shots...

1078
00:58:49.525 --> 00:58:52.361
...but second unit was mandated
to come back...

1079
00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:55.031
...and do some other shots
of the gun on the baby...

1080
00:58:55.197 --> 00:58:56.824
...and that's not so easy to do.

1081
00:58:56.991 --> 00:59:00.369
Because even if there is no bullet
and there is no risk...

1082
00:59:01.203 --> 00:59:03.664
...you still have the feeling
of, like, putting a baby--

1083
00:59:03.831 --> 00:59:05.750
Aiming a baby--
Aiming a gun on the baby.

1084
00:59:05.916 --> 00:59:07.768
- Something feels very wrong about it.
- Yeah.

1085
00:59:07.835 --> 00:59:10.963
At the same time, there was a lot
of shots of the baby, you know, enjoys--

1086
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:14.759
- The gun, it becomes like a toy.
- So she's touching it, it's shiny.

1087
00:59:14.925 --> 00:59:16.927
So we have to wait
that the baby cries, you know.

1088
00:59:17.094 --> 00:59:18.804
And that's the worst moment...

1089
00:59:18.971 --> 00:59:23.851
...you know, when you film the baby's
crying, and it's really awful.

1090
00:59:24.018 --> 00:59:25.186
That's also a big stunt.

1091
00:59:25.353 --> 00:59:27.146
We wanted to have, like...

1092
00:59:27.313 --> 00:59:31.442
...a very grotesque, dramatic
scene for Ethel's death.

1093
00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:34.487
And so it's, once again,
Cedric Proust...

1094
00:59:34.654 --> 00:59:37.782
...who did an amazing job
with this stunt double.

1095
00:59:37.948 --> 00:59:42.328
And what is funny was when we were,
like, editing in Paris with Baxter...

1096
00:59:42.495 --> 00:59:46.123
...at the end, he said, "You know,
you are lucky to have so many actors...

1097
00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:47.583
...that agree on playing...

1098
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.710
-...you know, all the stunt stuff."
- Exactly.

1099
00:59:53.964 --> 00:59:58.344
That's a scene that the MPAA
was also very hard to convince.

1100
00:59:58.511 --> 01:00:01.722
Because you are not used to see,
like, a gunshot on-screen...

1101
01:00:02.348 --> 01:00:05.393
...on the head of,
like, young actresses.

1102
01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:08.270
And that was very, very intense
and violent.

1103
01:00:08.437 --> 01:00:11.357
And all that scene was, like,
pretty problematic for the MPAA...

1104
01:00:11.524 --> 01:00:15.695
...and that's why they ask us to cut,
like, almost one minute...

for Robert Joy, who was playing Lizard.

1115
01:00:49.353 --> 01:00:52.273
- And that was not so easy.
- No.

1116
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.525
Yeah.

1117
01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:02.742
That's also something, like,
which reminds a lot of <i>High Tension</i>...

the same kind of...

Don't move, honey. Don't move.

more emotional, of course, here.

DOUG:
You're gonna be okay.

1125
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.846
Sweetheart. Okay.

Honey?

1127
01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:29.727
COMMENTARY: And dealing with blood
is always, like...

1128
01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:32.021
Always very hard
because blood is sticky...

1129
01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:37.318
...blood is, you know, like, dry
and then stuck everything.

1130
01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:42.406
For actress, it's, like, very,
very hard. And under the heat--

1131
01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:45.451
Fake blood is made often with sugar...

1132
01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:48.829
...and so flies are, like, everywhere,
like, around you.

1133
01:01:48.996 --> 01:01:50.331
So we were, like...

1134
01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:52.917
...not only trying to find
the best color for the blood...

1135
01:01:53.083 --> 01:01:55.419
...which is always
also a big challenge...

1136
01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:58.422
...because if you took blood
which is too orange or too red...

1137
01:01:58.589 --> 01:02:01.634
...it looks like ketchup and fake
and you don't believe in it.

1138
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:06.472
So you have to find exactly the perfect
color for night light and also for daylight.

1139
01:02:06.639 --> 01:02:08.474
But here it was also...

1140
01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:11.477
...find some fake blood
which is not based on sugar...

1141
01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:16.565
...so you don't have, like, too much
insects around you during the time.

1142
01:02:16.732 --> 01:02:18.484
It was just disgusting.
It was so sticky.

1143
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.903
And they were covered in blood
for most of the movie.

Ezra Buzzington,
who's playing Goggle...

1145
01:02:23.405 --> 01:02:28.702
...came for one day of shooting,
and it was one day of only second unit.

1146
01:02:28.869 --> 01:02:34.750
And he did all his stuff in, like,
half a day and half a night.

1147
01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:38.546
And it was a nightmare, I mean,
you can tell, for second unit...

1148
01:02:38.712 --> 01:02:40.965
...because everything broke that night.

1149
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:44.844
- The genny broke.
- Yeah. The light broke, everything broke.

1150
01:02:46.011 --> 01:02:49.807
And it was, like, a big deal
because it was a lot of prosthetics...

1151
01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:55.354
...and a lot of stuff for K.N.B.
and it was like middle of the shooting.

1152
01:02:55.521 --> 01:02:58.607
And at the beginning,
the scene was supposed to be...

1153
01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:02.820
...I mean, a little bit bigger.
We have to....

1154
01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:06.907
Okay, but that works,
and people are really cheering...

1155
01:03:07.074 --> 01:03:08.993
...with the dog's attacking
and getting revenge.

1156
01:03:09.159 --> 01:03:13.581
He's the first one of the Carter family
to get, you know, like--

1157
01:03:13.747 --> 01:03:16.041
- Yeah.
- To get revenge...

1158
01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:20.504
...and to fight for them
and stop being a victim.

1159
01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:25.134
That scene was very emotional,
even on set.

1160
01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:29.221
Kathleen asked me at the beginning
just to shoot, like, just a few takes...

1161
01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:33.350
...because she wanted to give a lot,
you know, up front, so....

1162
01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:34.852
And she's amazing.

1163
01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:39.023
I think, yeah, we did only two takes.
And it was great, it was really moving.

1164
01:03:39.189 --> 01:03:41.483
She's wonderful.

1165
01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:46.405
I think you are not using,
in this kind of film...

1166
01:03:46.572 --> 01:03:49.950
...in this kind of horror movie,
to have, like....

1167
01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:55.080
To let the acting be as real as that...

1168
01:03:55.247 --> 01:03:58.042
...and become very emotional.

1169
01:03:58.208 --> 01:04:01.295
You know, as usual, a horror movie
doesn't care about, like--

1170
01:04:01.462 --> 01:04:03.881
They don't care about, like, actors.

1171
01:04:04.048 --> 01:04:08.594
They just want to have violence
and brutal and effects and stuff.

1172
01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:11.555
And I really believe the acting
makes the scare...

1173
01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:13.641
...really much more intense.

1174
01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:16.810
It's so emotional. I remember when
we started doing the violent scenes...

1175
01:04:16.977 --> 01:04:20.189
...it was awful because we'd gotten
to know the family as the Carter family.

1176
01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:22.232
And it seemed like we were
all having fun...

1177
01:04:22.399 --> 01:04:24.860
...then all of a sudden,
we had to start killing them.

- Yeah, it was, like, very--

I mean, I was very sad
when Kathleen dies.

1180
01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:33.494
It was like, "Wow."

1181
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:36.121
You know, that means
that she's not in the movie anymore...

1182
01:04:36.288 --> 01:04:39.625

to collaborate with her.

and do nothing?!

1185
01:04:43.879 --> 01:04:46.607
COMMENTARY: And here, again,
we are, like, dealing with the contrast.

1186
01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:50.886
Contrast between the silence
and the emotion of her death.

1187
01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:55.140
And then they start fighting
and then they keep silent again...

1188
01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:57.309
...because they heard a noise outside.

1189
01:04:57.476 --> 01:05:00.771
And everything is like that, you know.
You play with the opposite...

1190
01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:06.151
...and with the alternates of,
you know, crazy energy...

1191
01:05:06.318 --> 01:05:10.531
...and then very silent fear
and suspenseful scene.

1192
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:15.911
That's, I think, the last shot
of Emilie in the film.

1193
01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:18.831

Yeah. Oh, my God.

1197
01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:28.048
That was probably the longest days
we had, 18-hour days.

1198
01:05:28.215 --> 01:05:29.883
- Yeah.
- A couple.

1199
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.369
- Mainly only 12-hour days because the crew...
- Yeah.

1200
01:05:32.469 --> 01:05:34.930
...would really refuse to work
over 12 hours.

1201
01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:38.684
Not that I blame them.

1202
01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:40.936

but tomandandy really, really...

1207

like, improved the movie...

1208
01:06:05.085 --> 01:06:08.589
...and improved the fear
and the emotion by their score.

1209
01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:10.966
I mean, it's amazing.
It's so different.

1210
01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:13.093
Sometimes it's really big
and orchestral...

1211
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:18.474
...sometimes it's very soft
and orchestral too, but also electronical.

1212
01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.060
I mean, they really bring
something to the movie...

1213
01:06:21.226 --> 01:06:25.397
...which is another layer
and another, like....

1214
01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:30.152
It's a kind of voice-over
to the film that really--

1215
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.738
I think they created sounds
I'd never heard before too.

1216
01:06:32.905 --> 01:06:37.534
Yeah, and they managed to be
not too present, to not--

1217
01:06:37.701 --> 01:06:41.413
You know, they are not eclipsing
the story and the Carters...

1218
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.373
...they're just here to underline...

1219
01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.959
...all the different emotions
the Carters are going through.

1220
01:06:46.126 --> 01:06:49.338
And as you say, it's great how they start
the movie with something ominous...

1221
01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:54.009
...and after, they slide very softly...

1222
01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.137
...onto something much more
orchestral and much more epic.

1223
01:06:57.304 --> 01:06:58.806
Yeah, and epic at the end.

1224
01:06:58.972 --> 01:07:01.892
The music at the end is really huge.
It's like--

1225
01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:05.521
It became like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>,
how you said. And it's very good.

1226
01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:09.024
But it's cool because it expresses
really the dark journeys, in fact.

1227
01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:13.403
Yeah, it's following what Doug Bukowski
is going through, you know, from--

1228
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:15.405
- His emotional journey.
- Yeah.

1229
01:07:15.572 --> 01:07:19.076
But tomandandy are wonderful.
Did a great job.

1230

That's my hands.

1233
01:07:31.672 --> 01:07:35.008
I was shooting, like, Big Bob
coming back to the gas station...

1234
01:07:35.175 --> 01:07:37.469
...and second unit was on
the other side of the road.

1235
01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:40.139
That was amazing, I got the chance
to shoot with the director.

1236
01:07:40.305 --> 01:07:44.017
Yeah, and I ran from the first set
because Aaron wasn't here.

1237
01:07:44.184 --> 01:07:46.270
I ran from the first set
to give my hand...

1238
01:07:46.436 --> 01:07:49.940
...because we are looking
quite the same, Aaron and I.

1239
01:07:50.107 --> 01:07:52.484
Which wasn't meant on purpose,
by the way.

1240
01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.821
And I did his hand,
and I was very proud...

1241
01:07:56.155 --> 01:07:58.740
...to be able to play
the Aaron Stanford hand.

1242
01:07:58.907 --> 01:08:02.119
Sometimes on set
we would confuse Aaron and Alex.

1243
01:08:02.536 --> 01:08:05.581
We'd walk up behind Alex
and say "Aaron" and vice versa.

1244
01:08:05.747 --> 01:08:09.835
Well, we just saw the dissolve between
his close-up and the sun rising.

1245
01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:13.755
It's nice also because you saw
the light on the side of his face.

1246
01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:18.552
And the sun is coming and the light of
the sun becomes the light on his face...

1247
01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:22.848
...which isn't real. The light of
the campfire, it's the same color.

1248

And that's the last shot of the film.

- Oh, my God.

The close-up of the ants
on the blood.

1251

It's the last, last shot
on the film in Marrakech.

1252
01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:37.070
It's funny, because all this part
was shot close to Marrakech...

1253
01:08:37.237 --> 01:08:38.780
...the three last days
of the shooting.

1254
01:08:38.947 --> 01:08:42.659
But it's funny because all
the locations are very remote.

1255

The first location where you see
dogs running through the hills...

1256
01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:52.211
...another location where you see
the vulture and also the mine.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.396
- Nothing is linked, yeah.
- Nothing is linked...

1258
01:08:54.463 --> 01:08:58.467
-...but it works very, very well.
- Yeah, you felt a continuity in the site.

1259
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:02.763
That mine is a salt mine
just like 50 minutes...

1260

...one hour out Marrakech.

1261
01:09:06.099 --> 01:09:10.646
And it's a place-- Nobody shot here
before, and it's amazing, it's huge.

1262
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:15.317
It's exactly the place.
We didn't touch the location.

1263
01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:22.366
The only thing is Joseph, like, prepared
for us the graveyard of the miner.

1264
01:09:22.532 --> 01:09:24.034
The first cut we did,
it was funny...

1265
01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:28.622
...because we open the door and we see
this corridor, as you see right now...

1266
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:32.000
...but we didn't have light.
Nothing, so we couldn't go further.

1267
01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:34.962
- It's right after when--
- We came back that we discovered that.

1268
01:09:35.128 --> 01:09:38.090
We discovered what we got inside
this huge cave.

1269
01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:40.759
- To me, it looks like a huge set.
- It really does.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:44.930
Yeah, and it's amazing
because it's so real. And it's so--

1271
01:09:45.097 --> 01:09:46.890
In fact, it's very easy to shoot inside.

1272
01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:48.767
- It was fine.
- Yeah, it was great.

1273
01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:50.811
- There were a lot of bats.
- Yeah, millions.

1274
01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.146
Millions of bats. And bat droppings.

1275
01:09:54.147 --> 01:09:56.984
But this was cool. This was so
much cooler than being outside.

1276
01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:59.903
Yeah, but you felt the salt in the air.

1277
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:02.990
- You could pick salt off the wall.
- Yeah.

1278
01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.870
It's a working salt mine.

1279
01:10:09.037 --> 01:10:10.831
That was a great find.

1280
01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:13.917
Oh, I'm happy that shot is back.

1281
01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:17.212
I forgot that we bring back that shot.
I'm very happy.

1282
01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:20.716
You know, we cut that for questions
of rhythm in the movie...

1283
01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:22.968
...and we bring it back for the DVD.

1284
01:10:23.135 --> 01:10:25.470
I think it's a good shot
to establish a little bit more...

1285
01:10:25.637 --> 01:10:27.639
...the graveyard of the miner.

1286
01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.990
And also that location
is really a blessing...

1287
01:10:45.157 --> 01:10:50.495
...because it's quite easy to access,
so it's quite easy to bring a crane in.

1288
01:10:50.662 --> 01:10:53.707
And here, like, to do,
like, a shot like that...

1289
01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:58.337
...in this kind of mine, it's not so easy.
It's, like, almost impossible as usual.

1290
01:10:58.503 --> 01:11:03.467
And here, I mean, you know,
everything was waiting for us, in fact.

1291
01:11:03.633 --> 01:11:07.387
It was really the perfect location and
the perfect place to make that movie.

1292
01:11:07.554 --> 01:11:10.766
And that's really, like--
You know, I don't know...

1293
01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:15.312
...like three hours
from the place we just left.

1294
01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:17.856
It's funny, that's three hours
from the place we left...

1295
01:11:18.023 --> 01:11:20.859
...that's where they fight at the end,
that's another location.

1296
01:11:21.026 --> 01:11:25.072
And that, his POV,
is gonna be other location.

1297
01:11:25.238 --> 01:11:28.742
So everything is removed by,
like, at least 200 kilometers.

[COMMENTATOR CHUCKLES]

1299
01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:36.541
Once again, Jamison Goei,
who supervised all the CG...

1300
01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:41.004
...made an amazing job for the town
that we can see here.

1301
01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:44.841
Jamison and Laura did a wonderful job
on the visual effects.

1302
01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:52.265
What we decide also for-- With Maxime,
the DP, is to start the movie...

1303
01:11:52.432 --> 01:11:59.272
...using 100 ASA film stock
and then, by night, using, like, 500 ASA.

1304
01:11:59.439 --> 01:12:04.277
And then for the third act, for all
the next day, in fact, using 250...

1305
01:12:04.444 --> 01:12:10.575
...but also doing
the 45-degrees shutter effect...

1306
01:12:10.742 --> 01:12:14.830
...which makes everything
look a little bit, like, strange.

1307
01:12:14.996 --> 01:12:18.083
All the movements
are a little bit different, a little bit off.

1308
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:22.671
I remember we didn't tell
to the editor that and he was in Paris...

1309
01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:24.673
...and as I said, he freaks out.

1310
01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.217
He calls and he says,
"Hey, there is something wrong.

1311
01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:30.429
Everything is, like, faster or slower,
I don't know.

1312
01:12:30.595 --> 01:12:33.932
There is, like, a kind of strange effect
on all the frames, you know?"

1313
01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:38.437
As soon as you see some particle
or fire or element fly in the wind...

1314
01:12:38.603 --> 01:12:42.190
...you can feel the difference
of the 45-degree shutter effect.

1315
01:12:42.357 --> 01:12:45.026
- And you forgot to tell Baxter?
- Yeah.

1316
01:12:45.193 --> 01:12:47.154
But it's funny
because when he told us that...

1317
01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.781
...you know, we forgot also
that we used that.

1318
01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:52.451
We don't forget, but we didn't
understand what he was saying.

1319
01:12:52.617 --> 01:12:54.411
He didn't know that, so it was like:

1320
01:12:54.578 --> 01:12:56.413
"Okay, something's wrong,
something's wrong."

1321
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.957
So it was, like, a huge crisis on set.

1322
01:12:59.124 --> 01:13:01.793
We did have a crisis, though, with it.
What was the crisis we had?

1323
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.670
No, the crisis was with the light.

1324
01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:05.964
- Some light reflecting.
- That was it.

1325
01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:08.008
Which you couldn't see
by the naked eye.

1326
01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:10.135
Yeah, that was a big deal.

1327
01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:12.345
That was a bit of a crisis,
we had to reshoot.

1328
01:13:12.512 --> 01:13:14.222
Yeah, that we didn't use.

1329
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:15.599

- I mean, that's good. That's life.
- Okay.

1332
01:13:19.644 --> 01:13:22.147
We didn't have to reshoot as much
as we thought we'd have to.

1333
01:13:22.314 --> 01:13:24.107
No, we didn't reshoot-- I mean....

1334
01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:27.110
There is, well, like,
principal photography, and that's it.

1335
01:13:27.277 --> 01:13:32.115
I remember being in-- Before prep,
with all of you guys saying:

1336
01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:35.076
"You know, in Hollywood,
you have to reshoot, that's the rule."

1337
01:13:35.243 --> 01:13:37.120
- That's true.
- Everyone reshoots.

01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:39.289
- Everyone do some--
- Absolutely.

1339
01:13:39.456 --> 01:13:40.499
And we didn't.

1340
01:13:40.665 --> 01:13:43.376
I don't know that I've worked
on a movie where we didn't reshoot...

1341
01:13:43.543 --> 01:13:44.794
...I think, other than <i>Scream</i>.

1342
01:13:44.961 --> 01:13:47.797
I think I've had to go back and reshoot
on every movie I've worked on.

1343
01:13:47.964 --> 01:13:50.759
Yeah, and we were pretty--
Not "sure," I won't say that.

1344
01:13:50.926 --> 01:13:52.511
But we were pretty, like, confident...

1345
01:13:52.677 --> 01:13:55.472
...that we would have enough material
to do the movie.

1346
01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:57.641
I guess the American version is
that you test it.

1347
01:13:57.807 --> 01:13:59.684
And if you need to reshoot,
you reshoot.

1348
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:02.437
Luckily we did, we tested it,
and we didn't need to reshoot.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.648
- It was great.
- That was great, yeah.

...because you're really the one that
trusted us about the size of that town.

1361
01:14:32.175 --> 01:14:35.554

to build all the different houses...

1362
01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.933
...with all that mannequins coming from
U.S. with all the furniture to build.

1363
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.562
- It was, like, so expensive as a set.
- Yeah, all this furniture was built.

1364
01:14:43.728 --> 01:14:46.314
Because in Morocco
they couldn't find '50s furniture...

1365
01:14:46.481 --> 01:14:49.192
...so the set-decorating department
built all of this furniture.

1366
01:14:49.359 --> 01:14:51.570
Everything was built.

1367
01:14:51.736 --> 01:14:55.574

the movie which is not in the original...

...all that third act
which is not in the original film...

...were, like, being the center and
the climax of our new <i>Hills Have Eyes</i>.

The details are amazing,
like that wallpaper.

1371
01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:08.378
All the wallpaper Joseph chose
is vintage wallpaper.

1372
01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:10.380
I mean, he really looked
long and hard...

1373
01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:12.215
...to make sure every detail
was perfect.

1374
01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:14.551
And the mannequins
were made for us...

1375
01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:18.179
...according to mannequins from the
'50s that they used in this test village.

1376
01:15:18.346 --> 01:15:23.018
And all the car from the '50s are coming,
like, from different places in Morocco.

1377
01:15:23.184 --> 01:15:27.230
You know, like, special shipment
to Ouarzazate.

01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:28.732
Just to find all that wardrobe...

1379
01:15:28.898 --> 01:15:32.694
...and, you know, age all that wardrobe.
And the detail is amazing.

1380
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:34.404
Joseph really did a great job.

1381
01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:39.117
And the music here also reminds the
feeling of the Sergio Leone Western...

1382
01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:42.537
...with the electric guitar and stuff.
Tomandandy were great here...

1383
01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.415
...because they really get
what we tried to do behind.

his heroic journey.

1385
01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:52.297
This set is the biggest set in our movie,
and it was just behind the studio.

1386
01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:54.633
Like one kilometer
behind the studio.

1387
01:15:54.799 --> 01:15:59.971
And it was funny for us, coming from
the low budget, to have this huge set...

1388
01:16:00.138 --> 01:16:02.891
...where we'd shot, like, just
two days and a half, or three days.

1389
01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.993
- No, more, more. Three days.
- For the outside.

1390
01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.228
For the outside is three days.

1391
01:16:07.395 --> 01:16:10.440
Inside the Big Brain house
is like four, five days.

1392
01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:13.276
And Big Mama house was the--

1393
01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:16.488
Was including the three days
because it's on set.

1394
01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:20.283
But it's-- You know, it's like--
Joseph did a so amazing job.

1395
01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:25.163
Joseph Nemec, the production designer.
He was really tough with all his crew.

1396
01:16:25.622 --> 01:16:27.582
- Oh, man.
- He was really, like, behind them...

1397
01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.918
...all the time,
but you can really feel--

1398
01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:33.963
And I think it's one
of the best craftwork he did ever.

1399
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:36.841
I do too. I think it's beautiful.
And he did an amazing job.

1400
01:16:37.008 --> 01:16:38.385
And he had so many challenges.

1401
01:16:38.551 --> 01:16:42.347
The language, just finding props
and things, you know, in Morocco. He--

1402
01:16:42.514 --> 01:16:44.115
- He never give up.
- He never gave up.

1403
01:16:44.182 --> 01:16:47.143
And the colors are so beautiful
in the movie.

1404
01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.788
- His color theme is amazing.
- Here also you can see...

1405
01:16:49.854 --> 01:16:53.066
...the hills on the back of the shot,
not on the frame.

1406
01:16:53.233 --> 01:16:56.611
All the hills are, like,
added by Jamison in CGI.

1407
01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:59.280
Yeah, all the hills were added.

1408
01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:02.742
CGI picked them out.

1409
01:17:02.909 --> 01:17:05.328
Joseph had a blast here
designing these different houses.

1410
01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:09.249
Yeah, and everything, also, you feel
the wind and you feel the dust...

1411
01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.000
...but it's always like that.

1412
01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:14.421
You know, when you need the dust and
we need the wind, you don't have it.

1413
01:17:14.587 --> 01:17:18.007
So we were on set
with two huge wind machines...

1414
01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:20.260
...and everything was shot
with the wind machines...

1415
01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:24.264
...which make like 100-decibel sound
all the time...

1416
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:27.225
...so it was almost impossible
to communicate with the actors...

1417
01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:30.228
...and with, you know, Aaron Stanford
when we were shooting...

1418
01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:32.647
...because the wind was so strong...

1419
01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:35.984
...and the sound was so strong
that you were just like....

1420
01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.694
It was nightmare
because of the heat...

1421
01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:41.781
...but not only that. Because also of
the sound of the wind machines all day.

1422
01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:50.582
All that part of the film where he's going
inside the house to take the baby...

1423
01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:57.213
...and then be knocked off
by Big Mama was added during prep.

1424

I come back to the average
of film stock.

1582
01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:37.900
I said the average
and the number of shooting days.

1583
01:26:41.237 --> 01:26:44.365
So many gags back together,
you know. It's like he--

1584
01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:47.159
When you are shooting that,
you get very excited on writing...

1585
01:26:47.326 --> 01:26:48.786
...so you add and add and add.

1586
01:26:49.203 --> 01:26:51.831
And then when you are shooting,
you say, "Oh, that's too much."

1587
01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:55.501
I mean, we're, like, just hearing
the story about it and we need to go--

1588
01:26:55.668 --> 01:27:01.007
We have like 100 pages to come.
It's never end. Never end.

1589
01:27:01.173 --> 01:27:03.467
I think that's--
I never had that feeling before.

1590
01:27:03.634 --> 01:27:05.094
Like, to be in the scene...

1591
01:27:05.261 --> 01:27:07.638
...and feeling that you will
never finish the scene...

1592
01:27:07.805 --> 01:27:09.473
...because it's so big,
it's so ambitious.

1593
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.892
- So much ahead.
- Yeah.

1594
01:27:12.059 --> 01:27:16.439
Because we are using prosthetics,
we are using a little bit CG...

1595
01:27:16.605 --> 01:27:19.900
...we are using wire for the stunts.
We are using-- I mean--

1596
01:27:20.067 --> 01:27:22.778
- Dogs.
- Dogs. I mean, it's...

1597
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:27.575
So here, once again,
I'm thinking about the stuntman...

1598
01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:32.621
...because you have to imagine Michael
Bailey Smith was an ex-Dallas Cowboy...

1599
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:34.999
- Football player.
-...football player.

1600
01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:38.502
So you have to imagine,
when he goes through the wall--

1601
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:42.340
- And against him.
- Against him, it's like...

1602
01:27:42.548 --> 01:27:44.633
- It's real. It's not fake.
- He's huge.

1603
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.554
And here, I mean, the cut fingers were
also a big deal with the MPAA...

1604
01:27:48.721 --> 01:27:50.806
...because it was made in
a very real way.

1605
01:27:52.141 --> 01:27:53.893
The first shot is made
with prosthetics...

1606
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:57.521
...and the other shot is made with
green finger, which, you know, like...

1607
01:27:58.356 --> 01:28:00.149
...then you erase.
So he can turn his hand...

1608
01:28:00.316 --> 01:28:03.861
...and you really have a feeling
that his fingers are cut.

1609
01:28:09.575 --> 01:28:13.287
Of course, one of our main influence
here is the <i>True  Romance</i> scene...

1610
01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:16.332
...between Patricia Arquette
and the Mob guy...

1611
01:28:16.499 --> 01:28:21.504
...you know, like, fighting. It's really,
like, one of the best scenes ever made.

1612
01:28:21.670 --> 01:28:24.173
And we used that scene
a lot in <i>High Tension</i>.

1613
01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:30.137
And here it wasn't even like,
you know, like, a conscious reference.

1614
01:28:30.304 --> 01:28:33.182
It was, like, already inside us.

And all the-- I'm looking at the ax
and I'm thinking about, you know...

1616
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:40.022

1617

for the bad guys in Ouarzazate.

he doesn't know anything about movies.

the sketches from Joseph...

- Right. Yeah.

1625

That was a very hard effect.

1626
01:29:14.473 --> 01:29:19.311
That was the most ambitious effect
in the film for prosthetics makeup.

1627
01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:21.647
And we are using, like, a dummy...

1628

...and we are using the real actor,
and we are using--

1629

and parameters...

-...that make the scene possible.
- Also a challenge for the MPAA.

1631

And also a huge challenge
for the MPAA...

1632
01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:36.370
...because, once again,
I think what disturbed the MPAA...

1633
01:29:36.537 --> 01:29:38.998
...was the fact that everything
looks so real.

1634

And this shot, it's our tribute
to <i>Straw Dogs</i>, in fact.

1635
01:29:42.751 --> 01:29:47.965

to make the movie.

...using Michael Berryman
for that part.

1643
01:30:08.861 --> 01:30:13.699
And Greg came at the end
and did Cyst.

1644
01:30:13.866 --> 01:30:17.077

first time of his life where it's, what...

...came during prep with Aaron,

1651
01:30:35.262 --> 01:30:37.264
We saw the ax and we were,
like, thinking:

1652
01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.767
"That wasn't planned like that."
And we're, "Okay."

1653
01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:42.478
So at that point, Doug mans up...

1654
01:30:42.645 --> 01:30:47.066
...and he's really, like, ready
to become almost vicious.

1655
01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:50.653
So he has to use the pick
of the ax to kill him in the eye.

you know--

We were thinking about,
"Oh, make the scene efficient...

1662
01:31:06.585 --> 01:31:10.130
...without seeing too much of the dog."
Because the dog was a nightmare.

1663

And it's not the dog
that we used before.

1664
01:31:12.341 --> 01:31:16.136
In fact, it was funny because it was
impossible to have the dogs growling.

1665
01:31:16.303 --> 01:31:21.850
So we asked to the production
to send some dogs from Casablanca...

...dogs from the military department.

1667
01:31:24.436 --> 01:31:27.064

just to do this shot.

he came just for his close-up.

some mannequins put in orgy positions.

1675
01:31:58.095 --> 01:32:00.472

- Yeah, that was a big deal.

Because we're outside on location...

I think that's the only crane shot
that you can find in the movie--

1765
01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:56.977
I mean, in the trailer in the movie.

- The explosion.
- They were so far away.

1767
01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:04.651
- It doesn't look that way.
- It looks like they are 50 meters away...

In real life, they needed
like 20 minutes to climb.

the shot makes the trailer...

- Yeah. It looks perfect.

it looks like it was made in CG.

Like you had the explosion behind.
But it's not the case.

1774

That was really made on set,
on production.

1775
01:37:29.885 --> 01:37:33.263
And it's not so easy to create
a so big explosion with the Airstream...

1776
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:35.766
...because the Airstream are solid.
You have to precut...

...all the Airstream in different parts...

1778
01:37:38.977 --> 01:37:43.065
...so everything blow. But you also
have to tie all the pieces with wire...

1779

very far away and hurt someone.

We were so lucky also
with the Airstream...

1782

...because shooting the movie with the
Airstream was one of the first ideas--

Carter family in the original film.

that we needed to Morocco...

01:44:31.723 --> 01:44:33.975
With "In the Valley of the Sun,"
is very positive music.

1891
01:44:34.142 --> 01:44:35.769
With the red...

1892
01:44:35.935 --> 01:44:40.440
And the red crawl, which is like
a reminder of the original picture...

1893
01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:43.485
...and a lot of, you know, like,
films in the '70s.

1894
01:44:43.651 --> 01:44:46.863
You know, we wanted
these very specific, like, things.

1895
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:50.241
It's funny because right now
they don't do this kind of--

1896
01:44:50.408 --> 01:44:52.427
- End credit. End crawl.
- How they crawling or--

1897
01:44:52.494 --> 01:44:54.704
Yeah, because for TV, they said that--

1898
01:44:54.871 --> 01:44:56.414
- You can't read it.
-"We don't care."

1899
01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:59.292
And we really wanted that.

1900
01:44:59.459 --> 01:45:02.212
- It looks so cool.
- Yeah, yeah, it's really funny.

1901
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.839
- Thanks. I hope you enjoyed this.
- Thanks for joining us.

1902
01:45:05.048 --> 01:45:07.342
I think you enjoyed the film
and you're not too scared.

1903
01:45:07.509 --> 01:45:09.719
- And you understand what we say.
- Enjoy the DVD.

1904
01:45:09.886 --> 01:45:13.848
Yeah, thanks for your patience
with the French accents.
