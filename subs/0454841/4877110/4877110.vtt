00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260
Help me! Help me. Help me.

2
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.380
My cake is ready.

3
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.180
Time for the show. Everybody on stage.

4
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.440
Ruby?

5
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.490
Is that you?

6
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.740
Goddamn it.

7
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.880
Ruby?

8
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.310
Ruby?

9
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.190
Ruby?

10
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.800
Ruby?

11
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.220
If that's you,Jupiter,
I got some buckshot for you.

12
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.270
Ya hear me?

13
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.160
I told you, it's over!

14
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.740
I'm out! Ya hear me?

15
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.420
You're on your own now!

16
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.330
I-

17
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.460
I'm sorry,
I can't do this anymore.

18
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.410
Oh.

19
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.400
Huh?

20
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.570
Hello.!

21
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.910
Hey!

22
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.040
- Ah! It's hot out here.
- Honey,you ought to stay
in the car out of the wind.

23
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.790
- Well, honey, I have to stretch my legs.
- Where the hell is everybody?

24
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.050
- Hello?
- Hey.

25
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.550
- Get up,jackass.
- Bobby!

26
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.310
Oh. Hey.

27
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.850
- Fill her up and check the fluids, my friend.
- Oh, yeah. Right away, sir.

28
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.770
Hey!

29
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:42.190
- Beauty, Beast, stop it!
- Ah! Ah! Damn it!

30
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.780
You okay?

31
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.030
Tell me again why we couldn't fly
like normal people? Oh, that's right.

32
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.540
- They wouldn't let your dad drive the plane.
- Doug, relax, please.

33
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.460
It's their silver anniversary,
and they're so happy you came.

34
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:01.460
- Your parents can't stand me.
- Nope, you're wrong. They love you.

35
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.500
I could have taken them
on a cruise.

36
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.340
Hey, you know what?
Stop. I never ask you for anything, okay?

37
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.050
Just think how happy you'll be when
Catherine comes along on our 25th, huh?

38
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.510
Huh?

39
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.730
Aw, it's okay.

40
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.520
It's not gonna be
in a fucking trailer home.

41
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.440
Don't see too many travelers around here.
Where y'all headed?

42
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.740
- San Diego.
- California?

43
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.660
- Uh-huh.
- Sure didn't take the fastest road.

44
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.870
Oh, no. We absolutely
had to see the desert.

45
00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.330
- Didn't we, Bob?
- Absolutely.

46
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.160
There ain't nothin'
to see in the desert.

47
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.210
Really?
Did you hear that, honey?

48
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.840
Yeah.

49
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.880
Don't you know it's illegal
to smoke around a gas pump?

50
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.760
Yeah.

51
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.180
- Come here. Come on.
He's a good little piggy.

52
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.100
Little baby piggy.
Little baby piggy.

53
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.230
Hey, Bobby, come over here.
Look at this.

54
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.940
Oh, my God.
That's so random.

55
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.230
You two make a perfect pair.

56
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.480
- Hey.

57
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.740
You're sweet.

58
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.530
Yeah.

59
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.490
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't pee there.

60
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.410
What the hell do you care?
Just turn around for a second.

61
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.380
Uh, hello.
Don't you see that?

62
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.630
Geez.

63
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.970
[ Older Woman ] She's so uncomfortable
in this heat. I told you to use cloth diapers.

64
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.100
- Mom, the doctor said these were fine.
- Look at those little cheeks.

65
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.350
- I know, sweetheart.
- Yes, she is. It's okay.

66
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.440
I think she's getting hungry again.

67
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.900
Uh, excuse me. Do you have a phone I can use?
I can't get a signal out here.

68
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:06.360
No, I don't.

69
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.280
Hey, Bukowski.
Give the cell phone a rest.

70
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.330
Sorry, Bob. Duty calls.

71
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:14.870
Honey,you've been on the phone
since we left, really.

72
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.380
Well, sweetheart,
I've been gone two days.

73
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.170
I have to make sure that
my store's not burning to the ground.

74
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.590
Oh, God.

75
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.180
What the hell, Brenda?

76
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.230
Damn it!

77
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.690
Damn it!
Got it all over my hand.

78
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.730
How far are we from I-88?

79
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.740
- Freaking perv.
- What?

80
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.910
- You're at least five or six hours.
- You hungry, sweetie?

81
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.660
- Why couldn't we
have gone through Santa Fe?
- It's nasty out here.

82
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:58.200
- Honey, could you put a cork in it for a minute?
- Well, if I do say so myself...

83
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.290
ma'am, your husband here's
quite right.

84
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.790
This is the only southbound road
going to I-88. From there...

85
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.420
you can take the 40 to California,
but it's a long, old drive.

86
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.300
That doesn't bother me a bit.
I like to drive at night.

87
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.840
I used to work the night patrol
for 1 5 years.

88
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.890
Is that right? You a cop?

89
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.810
- Well, detective.
- Not anymore, thank God.

90
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.680
- I'm starting my own, uh, security firm.
- Uh-huh.

91
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.560
You a cop too, mister?

92
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.730
No. I'm in telecommunications.
I sell cell phones.

93
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.320
- You won't find any customers around here.
- Yeah, no kidding.

94
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.320
Everything's fine. Oil's okay.

95
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.320
Beauty, come back here.!

96
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.040
Hey, buddy.
What do I owe you?

97
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.370
Uh, $46 even.

98
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.790
Oh, hey, Bob, here.
Let me take care of that.

99
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.630
I can still afford the gas, Bukowski.
Keep the change, my friend.

100
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.590
That's not what I meant.

101
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.300
Beauty?

102
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.470
Beauty?

103
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.140
Beauty?

104
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.680
Beauty? Come on, girl.

105
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.400
Beauty?

106
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.230
Beauty? Come on, girl.

107
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.410
Hello?

108
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.660
Is anyone there?

109
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.500
Beauty!

110
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.220
- Can I help you, miss?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

111
00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.350
It's just our dog. She just-
She got out, and she won't stay put.

112
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.390
- Lynn, we're leaving.!
- Come on, girl. Let's go.

113
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.780
Bobby, she keeps getting out.

114
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.950
- It's all right. I got her.
- Okay.

115
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.790
Oh, honey? Honey?
Could you, uh, tell him to take it easy?

116
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.420
- The heat's making me nauseous.
- Let's go!

117
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.460
Do you need something?

118
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.090
No, thanks.

119
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.300
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.!

120
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.300
Honey, we're on vacation.

121
00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.600
Yeah?

122
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.180
You know, uh...

123
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.690
it's not on the map,
but if you...

124
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.070
take a left at the dirt road,
couple miles from here...

125
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.070
- Uh-huh.
- it'll lead you through the hills.

126
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.320
Probably save you
a couple ofhours.

127
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:56.030
Can't miss it.
Uh, there's an old fence right in front.

128
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.450
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

129
00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.750
Old fence, dirt road,
two miles.

130
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.830
Mm-hmm.
You have a safe trip.

131
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.880
Thank you.

132
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.940
Dad, I hate your singing.

133
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.940
Guys, no.

134
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.320
- Stop.!
- Imagine the first people
to cross this desert.

135
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.370
They didn't know
where they were.

136
00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.620
- Yeah, I can, because neither do we.
- Brenda, the road is here.

137
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.290
It exists.
It's got to go somewhere.

138
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.670
Besides, look how beautiful it is.
Look at the light on the rocks.

139
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.670
It's gorgeous.

140
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.380
- This is so fucked!
- Excuse me?

141
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.630
Watch your language, young lady.

142
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720
I would like
a little backup here.

143
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.800
- This is such bullshit.
- Hey, watch your fucking mouth!

144
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:54.480
Can we just calm down here?
We're all a little tired, okay?

145
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.400
Yeah, Mom. Didn't you grow up in the '60s?
Why are you so uptight?

146
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.150
Your mom didn't
used to be uptight.

147
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.570
- She was a little hippie chick.
- No.

148
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.110
You should have seen her when she was
your age. She was a little hottie.

149
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.620
- Dad.
- Stop that.

150
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.580
Driving through the New Mexico desert
in the middle of summer...

151
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.420
with a broken air conditioner.

152
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.420
Great vacation.

153
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:29.550
I'm glad you came because
I would have been so fucking bored otherwise.

154
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.470
Yeah. So bored.

155
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.600
Oh. Give up on that, man.

156
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.730
I tried for an hour and a half.
Thing's ancient.

157
00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.770
Wiring's medieval.
Needs to be replaced.

158
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.520
There.

159
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.780
There.
It's just the, uh, thermostat.

160
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.780
It's disconnected.

161
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.030
Anyway, at least
we can breathe now.

162
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.000
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

163
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.330
- Does my sister know?
- Hey, man.

164
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.670
Fuck your sister.

165
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.670
You know, uh, Big Bob'd
get pretty pissed off...

166
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.880
if he found out you were smoking
in his newly renovated '88 Airstream.

167
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.930
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.060
Well, fuck Big Bob too.

169
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:24.560
Here. Want one?
Go ahead.

170
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.900
Uh-uh.

171
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.480
Your sister would cut my nuts off
if you start smoking.

172
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.150
I think she did that
a long time ago.

173
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.240
I think you're right.

174
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.240
I think we're somewhere
on this blue road.

175
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.120
Mom, we're not on the blue road
or any other road.

176
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.330
The guy said it wasn't
on the map, remember?

177
00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.330
Oh, my God.!

178
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.010
Jesus.! Hang on.!

179
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.050
Watch the baby!

180
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.520
Honey? Where's the baby?

181
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.570
- She's right here.
- Is she okay?

182
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.610
- She's fine. She's fine.
- What the hell happened?

183
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.280
- The heat must have caused a blowout.
- Are you okay?

184
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.240
Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just a little scared.

185
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:32.290
Where's Bobby? Bobby.
Are you all right, honey? Are you okay?

186
00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.330
He's all right.

187
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.670
I knew this wasn't going
to be safe for the baby.

188
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.130
- You okay?
- Yeah, we're okay. We're fine.

189
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.630
Son of a bitch!

190
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.090
- Okay, okay, we're all right.
- Oh, my God. The whole trailer.

191
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.260
Come here, guys.
Come here.

192
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.100
Beauty.!

193
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.140
Beast.!

194
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.650
We are so fucked.

195
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.200
- Did you find a signal?
- No. Nothing.

196
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.210
Ninety-seven percent nationwide coverage,
and we find ourselves in that three percent.

197
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.750
- Yeah.
- Well, your dad wanted to see the desert.

198
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.830
I hope he's enjoying himself.

199
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.420
Doug, don't start.

200
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.130
- Maybe somebody will need
a rent-a-cop around here.
- Doug!

201
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.090
- What?
- Come on.

202
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.010
Every chance the guy gets, he takes me
down a peg. Can't snap back at him?

203
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.680
- Yeah, well, don't stoop to his level.
- It's my fault?

204
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.560
200 degrees out here!
It's everybody's fault.

205
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.060
- Don't listen to him.
- Get off my back.

206
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.810
General, what's the damage?

207
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.860
The axle is broken,
and it's... totaled.

208
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.400
Can we fix it?

209
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.280
What?

210
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.740
No, the frame is twisted to hell.
We can't-

211
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.370
- With what? I mean-
- There she is.

212
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.830
Give me your damn cell phone.
I'm gonna call a tow truck.

213
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
No signal. I tried.

214
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.050
- Well, we can use the C.B.
- You can try it, but I doubt
you're gonna get anybody.

215
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.180
The freeway's way the hell on the other side
of those hills. You won't get a signal.

216
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.430
So, what are we gonna do?

217
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.560
Excuse me.

218
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.150
Bob? What are we doing?

219
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.110
We walk.

220
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.950
- We walk?
- Yep. You and me.

221
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.540
We're in the middle of the desert.
We're miles from anywhere.

222
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:55.500
It's either that, or we sit here
and wait for somebody to drive by.

223
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.300
Have you seen anybody drive by
since we got off the freeway?

224
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.340
I haven't seen anyone drive by since
you decided to take the shortcut.

225
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:05.140
- Honey. Honey, let's go for a walk. Okay?
- Okay.

226
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.220
There's nothing there,
you shitheads.

227
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.770
There you go. Ah, good boy.

228
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.030
I'm sure this desert is full of rattlesnakes.
Is that locked?

229
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.160
- Bobby, come here.
- I think that's locked.

230
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.790
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.750
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.

232
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.960
- You know, I saw- Mom?
- What?

233
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.800
- Safety's on, boy.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.880
- I saw a documentary on desert snakes-
- Uh-huh.

235
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.680
On the Discovery Channel-
And there's some species...

236
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.550
if you get bit, you can die
within like 25 minutes.

237
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.930
Really? I'd like to see
how they stack up against this one.

238
00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.520
I thought those were gonna
stay locked up, honey.

239
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.850
- I thought you weren't talking to me, honey.
- You're right.

240
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.820
Relax, honey. I'm a licensed professional.

241
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.230
Besides, I'd take my bullets
over your prayers any day.

242
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.240
Well, some things never change.

243
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.860
So, what about, like, uh, scorpions
and coyotes and stuff?

244
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.490
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.

245
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.580
Hey, Doug. You wanna try?

246
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.500
- Hey, don't point that at me!
- Don't worry, man. The safety's on.

247
00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.790
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

248
00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.260
Leave Doug alone. He's a Democrat.
He doesn't believe in guns.

249
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.720
Oh. Come on, Dougy.
Come here.Just one shot.

250
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.260
It makes you feel kind of powerful.
You might like it.

251
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.390
I don't think so, Bobby.
I'd probably just shoot my foot off.

252
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.730
You know, he's right.

253
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.230
He'd probably shoot his foot off.

254
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.080
- Hey, ""B.''
- Hey.

255
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.910
How you holding up?

256
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.290
I am thrilled.

257
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.420
Yeah. This is a total drag.

258
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.800
Yeah, well, you know,
I really don't care what they say.

259
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.260
Next year, I am going
to Cancun with my friends.

260
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.760
Not going on any more
of these little family trips.

261
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:24.180
Well, we're not gonna have
many more of them, you know?

262
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.770
And if you want to go to Cancun,
you know you're gonna have to get a job.

263
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.270
Oh, yeah. What, you mean
like your job?

264
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.900
Brenda, I help Doug out
at the store, okay?

265
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.440
Oh, yeah.

266
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.030
Honey? Can you bring me myjacket?

267
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.780
I'll be right there, honey.

268
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.020
Bobby!

269
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.890
Fucker!

270
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.230
- Could you get me a Twinkie?
- No!

271
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:19.520
Aw.

272
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.120
-Just keep walking this direction.
- Yeah, fine.

273
00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.290
You find out where the road leads,
and I'll head back the way we came.

274
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.920
- Stay away from me.
- All right.

275
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.840
It's gotta lead somewhere.
Maybe back to the freeway.

276
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.260
- Are you taking a gun too?
- No, honey, I'm not.

277
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.470
I don't need a gun
to find help.

278
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.060
- I don't want this.
- You need the hat.

279
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.560
- It gives me hat head. I don't like it.
- Who cares?

280
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.060
- It's not about fashion.
- All right. Thank you.

281
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.270
Hey, listen. Uh, if you don't find help
within five or six miles,just come back.

282
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.730
All right?

283
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.490
- Here, honey.
- I'm gonna go to the gas station.

284
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.910
You're just never gonna make it back
by sunset is the only problem.

285
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.320
Honey, it's only about eight miles.
I'll borrow the old man's car.

286
00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:20.620
Use his phone, if he's got one. I'll be back
with a tow truck before nightfall.

287
00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.750
- Can I go with Doug?
- No. Nope.

288
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.460
You stay here with your mother
and your sisters. Now, hey, uh, Brenda?

289
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.000
Listen up. Your brother is
in charge, all right?

290
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.510
- So don't tease him.
- I think we should pray before you go.

291
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.550
- Oh, Mom!
- Brenda, is it really so much to ask?

292
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.840
- Yes.
- Come on.

293
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.850
Damn it.

294
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.930
We're waiting.

295
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.100
Thank God no one's watching us.

296
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.350
- Bobby.
- Stop it, Bobby.

297
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.020
- Stop.
- Thanks.

298
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.190
Please bless us at this time...

299
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.700
and send your guardian angels...

300
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.910
to help us to walk through
this valley in our faith...

301
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.370
this, yeah, with the help
of thy dear Lord.

302
00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.410
-  Amen.
-  Amen.

303
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.000
- Okay.
- Bye, Doug. Be careful.

304
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.130
- See you later.
- See you guys in a few hours.

305
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.170
Honey? Keep the hat on, okay?

306
00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.840
- Am I wearing it?
- Don't give me that look.

307
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.220
- Do you see it on my head?
- I love you.

308
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.510
I love you too. Bye.

309
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:34.600
Hi.

310
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.570
Hi, sweetness. Hello.

311
00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.860
Who doesn't want
to sleep anymore?

312
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.900
Are you hungry?

313
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.820
Please take your feet
off the table. Honestly.

314
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.620
Just because we're camping
doesn't mean you get to act like a pig.

315
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.120
You know, honey, really...

316
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.920
you shouldn't go
from the breast to the bottle.

317
00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.880
At her age, she should
get used to one or the other.

318
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.880
Mom, thanks for the advice,
but she's my baby.

319
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.640
I can't believe that we're stranded
in the middle of nowhere on your anniversary.

320
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.720
- Hmm.
- You know, if we just stayed on the main road...

321
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.890
we'd be in California right now.

322
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.900
What I'd give for a hot shower
and a cold margarita.

323
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.360
- The beach.
- A massage.

324
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.820
- I'll take a real bed.
- Yeah.

325
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.150
- The chronic.
- The what?

326
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.530
Brenda.!

327
00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.120
What?

328
00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.160
The chronic.
It's pot, Mom.

329
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.080
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who smokes pot?
- Yes, exactly.

330
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.540
- Who smokes pot?
- Hey, has anybody seen my red sweatshirt?

331
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.420
You know, the hoodie thing
in the backseat? Brenda?

332
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.840
- Weren't you sleeping on it?
- I haven't touched your smelly sweatshirt, okay?

333
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.340
Why are the dogs so excited?

334
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.510
- There's probably some
rattlesnakes somewhere around.
- Ew.

335
00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.180
You know how Freud would have interpreted
your obsession with rattlesnakes, Mom?

336
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.480
Bobby!

337
00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.600
So bad.

338
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.190
- Bobby Carter.! Stop that.!
- That's gross!

339
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.900
- That's so wrong.
- That was a little gross. I'm sorry.

340
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.780
- I apologize to the entire table.
- Well, thank you.

341
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.070
I'm really glad that
we all came on this trip together.

342
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.620
Ah, well, that makes one of us.

343
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.620
- Where is the, uh, fruit?
- Does anyone need anything?

344
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:30.540
No.

345
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.300
- Hey. Hey. Brenda!
- Wonderful.

346
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.510
- Are you kidding me? Do you know how long-
- Bobby.

347
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.550
- Bobby?
- Sorry.

348
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.640
Bobby, it's dinnertime.

349
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.760
- I'll get him, Mom. Bobby!
- This always happens.

350
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.770
Bobby, I don't want you going
away from the trailer right now.

351
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.100
Beauty!

352
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:01.450
Beauty!

353
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.260
Beauty!

354
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.840
Beauty!

355
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.480
Fuck!

356
00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.910
What the hell?

357
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.250
Look at that. Huh.

358
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.790
Hello?

359
00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.590
Hello?

360
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.970
Hey, buddy.

361
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:28.020
Hello?

362
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.490
Hello!

363
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.920
Hey, uh, I had a bit of a wreck
out on your, uh, shortcut.

364
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.680
Yo!

365
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.310
I grabbed some water, all right?

366
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.940
Uh-

367
00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.730
It's dead. Damn it.

368
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.030
Yo, my friend! Hey!

369
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.490
You here?

370
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.700
You home?

371
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.020
Hello?

372
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.820
Hello?

373
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.260
Weird son of a bitch.

374
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.650
Yeah.

375
00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320
Jupiter!

376
00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.950
I got buckshot, ya hear?

377
00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:47.580
Hey, mister.

378
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.920
You don't understand
what's going on here.

379
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.010
Hey!

380
00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.340
The kids...

381
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:04.720
grew up in the mines
like wild animals.

382
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.810
Open the door, slowly!

383
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.400
What kind of place
is that for children?

384
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.530
What kind of a place is that?

385
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.490
Okay. Put the weapon down.
Put it down, easy. Put it down.

386
00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.450
I did the best I could.
I'm sorry.

387
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.290
Hey!

388
00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.460
Daddy.

389
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.500
Daddy.

390
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.760
Daddy.

391
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.350
Daddy. Daddy.

392
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.850
Daddy. Oh, Daddy.

393
00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.310
Daddy. Daddy.

394
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.940
Daddy. Daddy.

395
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.020
Daddy. Daddy.

396
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.700
Daddy.

397
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.430
Would you give me that gun, Pluto.!

398
00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:35.600
- Give me the gosh darn gun.!
- Get on over here.!

399
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.720
That's right. Come on.
You oughtn't have a gun.

400
00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.160
Brenda?

401
00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.790
Brenda.!

402
00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.250
Hey, I'm here!
I'll be back in a minute!

403
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.670
Bobby!

404
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.010
Bobby!

405
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.350
Bobby.!

406
00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:30.730
Bobby.!

407
00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.420
Bobby.!

408
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.880
Okay, let me just-
Oh, honey, the hair.

409
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.090
It's just-

410
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:04.050
You know, you really are so lucky
that Brenda found you.

411
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.810
I mean, what if you'd had to spend
the whole night out there in the cold?

412
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:15.350
Hey, Bobby. Don't worry. Beauty will
come back when she's hungry, okay?

413
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.400
- Did you- Did you try the radio?
- It doesn't work.

414
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.910
But we heard something.
Some sort of breathing.

415
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.780
What breathing?

416
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.160
It was weird.
Right, Mom? I-

417
00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.540
I'm sure it was just static.

418
00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:38.580
Mom! It sounded like
a perverted call.

419
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:42.590
Only Mom would get
an obscene phone call out here.

420
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:46.590
Bobby! What-

421
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.430
- Honey?
- No, no, no, no! I want you guys to stay here.

422
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.600
What is wrong with him?

423
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.190
What's he doing?

424
00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.540
Shit.

425
00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.840
Beast.! Beast.!

426
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.840
- Hey, Bobby.
-Jesus Christ!

427
00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:35.220
Hey! Whoa, whoa!
Stop pointing the gun at me! Please!

428
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.760
-Jesus, Bobby!
- Doug, I'm sorry, man.

429
00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.390
It's me! You okay?

430
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.100
- Yeah.
- God!

431
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.400
- Didn't mean to startle you, man.
- Yeah, I know. I just-

432
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:52.690
Look, I found this place out here.
You wouldn't believe it. It's like the Twilight Zone.

433
00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.700
- Hey.
- Is that Bob?

434
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.700
- It's Doug. It's okay.
- Ta-da!

435
00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:01.160
Honey! Oh, my God! Thank God you're okay.
I was so worried about you.

436
00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:04.790
- No, I'm fine.Just exhausted. Look.
- Yeah.

437
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.790
Look at all this stuff
I found.

438
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.250
There's a huge crater out there.

439
00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:13.170
People must use it as a dump site.
I've never seen anything like it in my life.

440
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.170
- What are-
- Look at this stuff. It's brand new.

441
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.430
What are we gonna do with
a fishing pole in the desert?

442
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.260
- I thought you went to go find somebody.
- Road dead-ends in five miles.

443
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.890
That's where the crater is.
It's not a shortcut. It's just desert.

444
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.930
- It dead-ends?
- Dead end.

445
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.850
- I knew that old man was full of shit.
- Hope your dad did better.

446
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:30.900
Maybe wejust missed a turn.

447
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.940
- Honey, did you guys cook
any dinner? I'm starving.
- Yeah. Come on inside.

448
00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.110
- Great. Thanks. Brenda?
- Yeah?

449
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.200
Do you have that lip balm?
My lips are really dry.

450
00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.320
Are you serious? That's gross.
I'm not letting you use my lip balm.

451
00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.280
Do you use it
without telling me?

452
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.100
Wait. Bobby. Don't close that door.
We're leaving in a second.

453
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.180
- What?
- Get some rest for Daddy.

454
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:14.190
You guys aren't gonna wait
till Dad gets back?

455
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:18.190
No, Bobby, I'm exhausted.
I need to get some sleep.

456
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.280
No, no, no. It's fine.
You'll be more comfortable here.

457
00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:24.110
I'll sleep on the floor, and Mom and Brenda
are gonna be up front.

458
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.570
And you and Lynn can take the back.
We got extra sleeping bags.

459
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.370
Bobby, you got six people sleeping
in a three-person trailer.

460
00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:34.790
It's not comfortable.
It's a little bit weird. Okay?

461
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:38.040
- Honey, you gonna bring the water?
- Yeah.

462
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:43.380
- Hey, hey, hey. Doug, Doug. Can I talk to you?
- What's up?

463
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.720
- Baby, you coming?
- I'm almost ready.

464
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.220
- See, uh-
- What's going on?

465
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.390
- Uh, when I-
- Bobby.

466
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.810
- No, no, no, no. It's-
- Bobby, hey.

467
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.680
I'm sure your dad's gonna
be back soon. Okay?

468
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.440
I mean, come on.
He's Big Bob, all right?

469
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.610
I'm sure it's gonna take more than snakes
and scorpions in the night to stop him.

470
00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.990
- Okay?
- Excuse me.

471
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:11.400
- Sorry.
- Did you get pillows?

472
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.950
They're in the S.U.V.

473
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.790
Hey, hey, listen.

474
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:22.250
If he's not back by midnight,
we'll both go looking for him. Deal?

475
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:24.580
- Yeah. Deal.
- Okay.

476
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.000
- Get some rest, man.
- Good night, Bobby.

477
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:29.750
Good night.

478
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.010
What are you doing?
There's no mosquitoes in the desert.

479
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:35.180
Honey, there's
mosquitoes everywhere.

480
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.310
Hi.

481
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.540
Beast.

482
00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.580
Beast?

483
00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.020
Beast?

484
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.610
Beast?

485
00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:24.690
Beast?

486
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.490
Beast?

487
00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.800
Beast?

488
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.600
Beast?

489
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.480
Beast? Come here, boy.

490
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.860
Beast?

491
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.350
Hey. Guys! Guys!

492
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:42.890
- Oh, good God. What-
- Jesus!

493
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.770
- Bobby.
- What is it, Bobby?

494
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:49.940
- Guys, something- something
is going on around here, okay?
- What is it?

495
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.690
There-There are, like, people
or something living in those hills.

496
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:55.150
- People? Bobby.
- No, no, no, no. Doug.

497
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:57.950
- Doug. Doug. Please.
- Bobby. Bobby, listen to me!

498
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.240
We're in the middle of nowhere, okay?
Nobody lives in those hills.

499
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.530
- Beauty's dead.
- What?

500
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.750
I found her,
and, uh, she was, like-

501
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:12.420
- It looked like somebody cut her open, you know?
- Cut her open?

502
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.340
Yeah, and I-I didn't want
to say anything...

503
00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:19.380
because I didn't want to scare everyone
and I didn't want to get Mom upset.

504
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:24.800
But I'm telling you, there is something
going on, okay? And Dad's not even back yet.

505
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:28.970
Okay. All right. Stay right there.
I'll come check this out.

506
00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.480
- We're not alone.
- All right, Lynn.

507
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:35.980
You stay here,
you lock the car, okay?

508
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.820
Calm down, man. We're gonna check this out.
Now where did you see this?

509
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.860
Now!

510
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:51.950
It's Bob.

511
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.620
- Wait. We don't know what that is.
- It's Bob!

512
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:57.170
- We don't know what that is!
- Bob!

513
00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:00.500
Dad? Dad!

514
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:02.750
Brenda. Watch the baby!

515
00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.490
No!

516
00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.890
Hey, little birdie.
Hey, little birdie.

517
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:29.670
Get off!. Get your mother out of here!
Get your mother out of here!

518
00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:33.300
Doug.! Do something.!

519
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.310
Move! You gotta be
a man to do that!

520
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.860
I told you to move!
So, move!

521
00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:03.030
Now, get! Get!

522
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:11.540
Whoo!

523
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.750
What you got under there?
That's it. Give it to me. Whoo.! Whoo.!

524
00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.880
Fuck off!.

525
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:22.380
Come on. Yeah!

526
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.760
Whoo!

527
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.850
Whoo.

528
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.480
It's not my Bob.!
It's not my Bob.!

529
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.020
Come on, Mom. No! Let's go.
No,just come on.

530
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.190
It's not my Bob.

531
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.860
What was that?

532
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.160
Mom,just stay here, okay?

533
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:41.460
Help.! Help.! Help.!

534
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.630
Oh, you fat.

535
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.300
Oh. Big, fat...

536
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:54.840
and juicy.

537
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.570
No. No, please!

538
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.960
Bobby!
Bobby, where you going?

539
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:37.050
Fucking kill those motherfuckers!

540
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:40.680
Get back here.! Don't do something stupid.!

541
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.600
No. No.

542
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:41.650
Get back to the trailer!

543
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.630
Come on.!
Get out the door.!

544
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.970
Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!

545
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:11.720
- Brenda!
- Bobby!

546
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.970
Come on, now.
Look at me. Look at me.

547
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:18.270
That's it. Look at me.

548
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:22.480
Shit! I'll come back for ya.

549
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.940
Brenda!

550
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:28.190
Bitch stuck me like a pig!

551
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:46.370
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

552
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.310
No.

553
01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.730
Oh, God!

554
01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.400
Don't move! Don't move, honey. Don't move.

555
01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:19.950
Okay. Okay. All right.
You're gonna be okay.

556
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.620
You're gonna be okay. S-Sweetheart?

557
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.950
Okay.

558
01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.410
Honey? Sweetheart?

559
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.250
Lynn, come on!

560
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.170
Lynn!

561
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:40.220
Come on!

562
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.020
Oh!

563
01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.010
Hmm.

564
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:49.240
Okay.

565
01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.070
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

566
01:02:51.070 --> 01:02:52.160
What are we gonna do? Huh?
What are we-

567
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.870
What are we gonna do
if they come back, Doug?

568
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.540
This trailer is so small.
I clean and clean.

569
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:07.550
- It's still a mess.
- Shh.

570
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.710
It's a mess.

571
01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.100
- Is Big Bob home?
- Not yet.

572
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:22.310
Every- Everybody went to bed?

573
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.310
- Yes?
- Yeah.

574
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:27.650
Brenda's right here,
and Bobby's in the back.

575
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.610
Is Lynny sleeping? Hmm?

576
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.660
You need anything?

577
01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.910
- A blanket.
- Okay.

578
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.950
- It's cold.
- Okay.

579
01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.580
- It's cold.
- Shh. Shh. Nice and warm, huh? Nice and warm.

580
01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.220
You're so sweet, Doug.

581
01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:06.600
I understand why Lynny
loves you so much.

582
01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.770
So-

583
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.320
I'm not gonna take this shit.

584
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:25.990
- Hey, we're not going anywhere!
You wanna die too?
- I don't fucking care!

585
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.080
You wanna die, huh?
Look what they did to your mother!

586
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.830
Look what they did to your sister!
Huh? You stop and think!

587
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.000
You're not a fucking child anymore!
You won't make it three feet out there.

588
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.250
We need a plan.
We need to think.

589
01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:40.340
- We need-We need to think.
- Think about what?

590
01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.300
Think about what, Doug?
They have Catherine!

591
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.340
They have your daughter.
And you're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

592
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.680
That's 'cause you're a fucking pussy
just like my dad said!

593
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.060
- Shut the fuck up! You shut up! Shut your mouth!
- Fuck you.

594
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.020
No.! Turn the lights on.

595
01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:00.570
Turn the lights on.
Turn the lights on.

596
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:04.820
- He said he's coming back.!
- Shh! Quiet!

597
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:07.570
He said he's coming back
for me. Please.

598
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.870
It's them! It's them!
It's them!

599
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:23.750
Goggle? Goggle?

600
01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:13.470
Goggle? You copy, Goggle?

601
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:18.430
Where's Goggle?

602
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.100
He stayed back there.
He's keeping an eye on them.

603
01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.650
- I told you.
- What?

604
01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:31.940
I told you,
you've gotta kill them all.!

605
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:53.540
Beast! Beast! You're alive!

606
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:57.670
Oh, good boy.
Good boy. Good boy.

607
01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:00.800
- Good boy.
- Oh, my God.

608
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.510
Jupiter's going to finish them off.

609
01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.680
Why are you doing this to us?

610
01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:10.980
Why are you doing this?
You hear me?

611
01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.980
Give me back my baby!

612
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:18.980
What the fuck
do you want from us?

613
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:22.530
What do you want?

614
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.870
You give me back my little girl.
You hear me?

615
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:44.340
- Bobby?
- Hmm?

616
01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:46.340
How many bullets
do you have left?

617
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.800
A clip and a half.

618
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.220
What are we doing?

619
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.570
Which way, Beast? Which way?
Come on. Follow the trail.

620
01:08:55.410 --> 01:08:57.620
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

621
01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.330
Come on, big guy.
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

622
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.110
Where are they, boy?

623
01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.680
Which way, Beast?

624
01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.150
Good boy.

625
01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.440
Bobby?

626
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.190
Bobby, I followed the blood trail.

627
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:53.400
It leads to a town or something
out here. Bobby?

628
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.830
Who knows?
Maybe someone heard our calls.

629
01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.670
Nobody's gonna hear
the fucking calls, Brenda!

630
01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.210
Nobody's gonna see the goddamn smoke
in this goddamn desert!

631
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.680
We're in the middle of freakin'-
Ah, shit!

632
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.140
God.!

633
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.980
I'm sorry.

634
01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.950
I'm so scared.

635
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:30.160
Who are these people?

636
01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:58.600
Good dog. Stay.

637
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.660
- Did you push her?
- Yes

638
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.790
- Did you destroy the furniture?
- No.

639
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.870
Did you call her
trailer park trash?

640
01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:19.510
- So, now,you're saying you still-
- I'm still in love with her.

641
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:21.930
Okay, but-So,you said
you treasured the marriage...

642
01:18:22.050 --> 01:18:25.260
and you wanted to end it
two weeks after you got into it?

643
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:27.350
I wanted to end it
because I have-

644
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:29.930
I had a feeling that things
weren't gonna work together.

645
01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:33.640
She wasn't working as a team player
with me, and I tried coaching her-

646
01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:35.860
- What were you doing coaching her?
- Well, I tried to show-

647
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:38.400
- Is she your child?
- No, she's not my child, but she-

648
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.900
Shh, shh, shh.

649
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:45.070
She wanted me
to eat dinner-spaghetti-

650
01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.530
and I wanted to do it
before it got cold.

651
01:19:51.090 --> 01:19:53.300
Watch her head, Bobby.

652
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.810
Come on.

653
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:45.640
Where's my daughter?
Where is she?

654
01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.890
Answer me.!

655
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:52.440
I don't know where she is.

656
01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.770
I never leave this place.

657
01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:04.070
Your people asked our families...

658
01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:06.240
to leave their town...

659
01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.000
and you destroyed our homes.

660
01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:15.880
We went into the mines.

661
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.460
You set off your bombs...

662
01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:23.340
and turned everything to ashes.

663
01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:29.930
You made us what we've become.

664
01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.600
Boom. Boom. Boom.!

665
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:38.230
Where's my baby?

666
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:41.320
What's so funny?

667
01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.110
It's breakfast time!

668
01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:53.550
Please don't kill me.

669
01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:57.050
"Please don't kill me."

670
01:28:57.130 --> 01:29:01.180
- Please don't kill me.
- "Please don't kill me. "

671
01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:35.560
Lizard.

672
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:37.600
Kill the baby.

673
01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.950
Baby. Baby.

674
01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.380
Get out of the way, Ruby.

675
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:04.390
I said get. Now, get!

676
01:32:16.690 --> 01:32:20.240
Mister, would you play with us?

677
01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.470
Ruby!

678
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:56.890
Catherine!

679
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:03.980
It's okay.

680
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:14.490
It's okay.
