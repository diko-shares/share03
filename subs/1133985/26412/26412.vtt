{850}{960}I'll tell you, Carol, it's quite a sight|up here. All those stars, the blue water.
{961}{1013}Reminds me of that night in Cabo.|Remember?
{1014}{1045}Hal, stay on the flight.
{1046}{1084}A lot of sangria that night.
{1085}{1140}- Boy, could you put it away.|- Hal.
{1141}{1198}I don't know how|we made it to the hotel...
{1199}{1240}Hal, you're at 91,400 feet.
{1241}{1312}Ten feet higher, the window cracks|and you're tapioca.
{1313}{1388}Just pushing it a little.|Maybe we'll set a record for the company.
{1389}{1540}Please, Hal. For once in your life,|no stunts, no surprises.
{1541}{1620}No surprises.
{2683}{2753}Find him.
{2783}{2856}Make this landing and we'll have|a perfect flight, Mr. Jordan.
{2857}{3073}So does this mean I get a gold star,|or just an incredible simulation?
{3415}{3471}What happened to the power?
{3472}{3513}Hello?
{3514}{3580}Carol? Anybody?
{3581}{3746}If I have to fly|this freaking park ride again...
{3869}{3929}Okay.
{4235}{4300}My God.
{4365}{4403}No.
{4404}{4458}It's all right.
{4459}{4502}My time has come.
{4503}{4532}You speak English.
{4533}{4580}No.
{4581}{4663}It's the ring.
{4677}{4790}It has chosen you. Take it.
{5516}{5615}You are now a Green Lantern...
{5616}{5694}...one of the protectors of the universe.
{5695}{5796}The Guardians will send for you.
{5797}{5839}Use...
{5840}{5888}...the ring...
{5889}{5961}...wisely.
{6620}{6702}What the hell?
{9773}{9958}...and when that weird|glow cleared, the simulator was...
{10590}{10695}Was there an earthquake?
{10749}{10827}I guess it's okay,|but a whole week?
{10828}{10859}Where are you going?
{10860}{10939}I don't know. I thought I'd do|some exploring. See some new sights.
{10940}{11006}Not much else to do|until we get word on the prototype.
{11007}{11083}Well, at least the simulator|wasn't damaged too badly.
{11084}{11140}Hey, Carol, gotta run.|I'll call you from...
{11141}{11218}...wherever.
{11547}{11579}So it's true.
{11580}{11668}Abin Sur really is dead.
{11669}{11736}Where is his body?
{11737}{11838}- I said, where is...?|- It was blown up with the spacecraft.
{11839}{11880}I want it off.
{11881}{11923}Hey!
{11924}{12044}The poozer's not even trained.
{12239}{12295}Someone's been practicing.
{12296}{12339}And without a manual.
{12340}{12433}Let's all power down for a moment,|shall we?
{12434}{12532}I don't think|we've been properly introduced.
{12533}{12571}My name is Sinestro.
{12572}{12628}This is Boodikka, Tomar Re...
{12629}{12743}- ...and you've met our charming Kilowog.|- Heh.
{12744}{12812}- And you?.|- Hal Jordan.
{12813}{12856}Well, Hal Jordan...
{12857}{12919}...we are members|of the Green Lantern Corps...
{12920}{13000}...an elite, intergalactic force|from the planet Oa.
{13001}{13095}Our superiors are a group of immortals|known as the Guardians.
{13096}{13169}- Yeah. They're supposed to send for me.|- That's right.
{13170}{13227}We're to bring you back for a little chat.
{13228}{13271}And in case you're wondering...
{13272}{13331}...this is not a request.
{13332}{13411}The ring isn't yours|until the Guardians have decided.
{13412}{13457}- Okay.|- Very good.
{13458}{13580}Tomar, would you do the honors?
{14050}{14185}We thought the trip might be easier|for you in a more earthly construct.
{14186}{14260}Uh, thanks.
{15000}{15058}You must understand, earthling...
{15059}{15144}...the Green Lantern Corps|is a privileged organization.
{15145}{15195}Not just anyone can join.
{15196}{15247}There are tremendous commitments.
{15248}{15300}Each Lantern is responsible...
{15301}{15408}...for patrolling one of 3600 sectors|of the universe.
{15409}{15460}- But...|- Sort of like one cop per precinct.
{15461}{15528}Uh, yes. I... I suppose.
{15529}{15578}My uncle was a cop.
{15579}{15601}Yes, but...
{15602}{15647}Thirty years on the|Coast City police force.
{15648}{15733}He used to let me|turn on the siren. Nice guy.
{15734}{15857}But more than that,|the Green Lantern ring is a complex tool.
{15858}{15935}It takes someone|with fierce concentration.
{15936}{15982}I think I got the hang of it.
{15983}{16030}He's got the hang of it.
{16031}{16059}Ranakar.
{16060}{16138}Why are we even entertaining this?|He's a human.
{16139}{16222}Yes, hard to get past that.
{16223}{16370}I'm afraid the human race of Earth|does not have the most stellar reputation.
{16371}{16510}The fact is humans are crude,|base, fearful and untrustworthy.
{16511}{16578}Then there's the smell.
{16579}{16639}You can't condemn an entire species.
{16640}{16682}You've said it yourself, Ganthet.
{16683}{16739}It's a wonder they've lasted this long.
{16740}{16803}Maybe you'd like me|to list their atrocities.
{16804}{16847}Maybe our human can help us.
{16848}{16947}Maybe he has a few of his own.
{16948}{17001}Listen, buddy, I didn't ask for this ring.
{17002}{17119}You want it back, take it,|because I've had enough of this crap.
{17120}{17219}Well, it appears we can add impertinence|to their many qualities.
{17220}{17260}The human has a point.
{17261}{17318}If he were as unworthy|as everyone says...
{17319}{17405}...no power in the galaxy|could have forced that ring on his finger.
{17406}{17533}Yet there it is, at one with him.
{17545}{17609}Guardian Council, if I may speak.
{17610}{17647}Please, Sinestro.
{17648}{17740}The Lantern of Sector 1417|is recognized.
{17741}{17783}Thank you, Appa Ali Apsa.
{17784}{17824}I'd like to make a proposal.
{17825}{17911}Allow me to take the human|under my wing, test him out...
{17912}{17959}...see what he's made of.
{17960}{17991}That's my job.
{17992}{18065}People can surprise you|if you give them a little incentive.
{18066}{18137}You have more important things|on your agenda, Sinestro.
{18138}{18204}We have a deepening crisis at hand.
{18205}{18296}I understand, sir, but I thought|the human could be of assistance.
{18297}{18345}It's a bit out of the ordinary...
{18346}{18407}...but I'd be interested|in Sinestro's evaluation.
{18408}{18460}Shall we put it to a vote?
{18461}{18540}All in favor.
{18815}{18902}So be it. The human falls|under your command, Sinestro.
{18903}{18975}Good luck.
{18979}{19021}I'm the trainer around here.
{19022}{19077}I know, I know.
{19078}{19191}- So, what now?|- Now, I own your ass.
{19192}{19259}Come on.
{19411}{19458}What's the crisis|they were talking about?
{19459}{19527}A small matter|of who's gonna control the universe.
{19528}{19671}Not that it's in the best hands as it is.
{19672}{19708}But first things first.
{19709}{19772}You are on sacred ground, Earth boy.
{19773}{19820}We're at the center of the universe.
{19821}{19903}This lantern contains the battery|that powers all the rings.
{19904}{20063}It also contains|all the known information of the cosmos.
{20064}{20141}A sort of atlas|and who's who of space.
{20142}{20208}We're going to be playing|in Sector 1215.
{20209}{20332}You need to be brought up to speed.
{20333}{20558}Stick your ring in the light, think|1215 and the battery will do the rest.
{20994}{21055}Unbelievable.
{21056}{21161}This isn't a travelogue.
{21689}{21795}Not bad.|The last rookie fried his antennas off.
{21796}{21848}Glad I could impress you.
{21849}{21879}But you do.
{21880}{21944}Unlike the others, I like humans.
{21945}{22043}I admire their spirit|and their natural contempt for authority.
{22044}{22095}It's well-founded here.
{22096}{22127}You mean the Guardians?
{22128}{22219}They were a power at one time,|but now they've grown soft.
{22220}{22278}They've no idea|what it's like on the front line.
{22279}{22335}But don't you worry, Earth boy.
{22336}{22423}They'll be taking notice of you.|I need to know if you've got the stuff...
{22424}{22479}- ... for what's ahead.|- What's that?
{22480}{22650}We're going to get the butcher|who killed Abin Sur.
{22784}{22843}Cadmendoh is a pustule of a planet.
{22844}{22903}A breeding ground of criminal scum.
{22904}{22980}One time I suggested we clean it out|with a meteor shower.
{22981}{23025}The Guardians thought I was kidding.
{23026}{23090}- Who we after?|- A squidman named Cuch.
{23091}{23124}He killed Abin Sur?
{23125}{23204}With a smile.
{23325}{23374}I don't have this place in my files.
{23375}{23409}It's called Labella's.
{23410}{23535}It changes addresses frequently.
{23596}{23628}Is he Labella?
{23629}{23676}He's the bouncer.
{23677}{23818}Watch my back|and keep your mouth shut.
{23832}{23890}Aah!
{23956}{23984}Boolywatt.
{23985}{24016}Sinestro.
{24017}{24053}Looks like a busy night.
{24054}{24096}Any chance Cuch has shown up?
{24097}{24132}Don't know no Cuch.
{24133}{24236}Booly, Booly, Booly. Look at you.
{24237}{24287}Like a big rubber Booly ball.
{24288}{24371}Bet I could bounce you off the wall.
{24372}{24454}I... I haven't seen him. I swear!
{24455}{24508}You know who to come to when you do.
{24509}{24569}Yeah.
{25404}{25455}Maybe we should have come undercover.
{25456}{25559}What's the fun in that?
{25668}{25710}Labella.
{25711}{25744}S... man.
{25745}{25807}You should've let me know|you were coming, baby.
{25808}{25851}Always surprising me.
{25852}{25884}Why you do that?
{25885}{25939}Could've made some cozy time.
{25940}{25998}I'm in a bit of a hurry, my dear.
{25999}{26039}I'm looking for Cuch.
{26040}{26072}Cuch?
{26073}{26107}Don't ask me.
{26108}{26142}I'm not his mother.
{26143}{26175}I heard he was in town.
{26176}{26239}Cuch left with the bug man, baby.
{26240}{26291}Long time ago.
{26292}{26340}Never come back to old Labella.
{26341}{26403}How come I don't believe you?
{26404}{26538}How come these suits got no zippers?
{26568}{26666}Aw, honey, you're not gonna|slam Labella for a little moon ball.
{26667}{26733}I can't control all the shank|that gets in here.
{26734}{26771}- Take it.|- What?
{26772}{26804}A little incentive.
{26805}{26849}Maybe it will jog your memory.
{26850}{26920}Go ahead.
{27202}{27266}You're a bad boy, S-man.
{27267}{27299}What about Cuch?
{27300}{27374}I told you.
{27396}{27431}No.
{27432}{27502}One more.
{27643}{27684}Sinestro, come on.
{27685}{27805}- Where is he?|- I don't know.
{27830}{27867}Honey, I beg you.
{27868}{27913}Where's Cuch?
{27914}{27993}I don't know.
{28153}{28183}End this.
{28184}{28240}I know what I'm doing.
{28241}{28296}He always comes back to you after a job.
{28297}{28328}Please...
{28329}{28463}And he's here. He's close, isn't he?
{28564}{28665}Just tell me, Labella.
{28790}{28836}What do you mean? Where is she?
{28837}{28904}Labella!
{28927}{28989}Shoot.
{29320}{29399}I'm going up.
{29947}{30052}- It's a fragger!|- Aah!
{31297}{31355}Aah!
{33588}{33638}I got lucky.
{33639}{33674}Unh!
{33675}{33708}You defied me.
{33709}{33758}You could've killed her.
{33759}{33802}Let me tell you, friend.
{33803}{33858}The only way to operate out here|is by fear.
{33859}{33898}They hit, I hit harder.
{33899}{33950}They attack, I annihilate.
{33951}{34038}I am the one constant, unassailable force|against their chaos...
{34039}{34102}...and you made them forget that.
{34103}{34148}You think I enjoy this?
{34149}{34206}Look at the universe|the Guardians have created.
{34207}{34286}We have the greatest power in the cosmos|and what have they made us?
{34287}{34325}Garbage collectors!
{34326}{34370}We pick up the trash.
{34371}{34422}A thief here, a killer there.
{34423}{34486}Scum, dirt, filth!
{34487}{34566}There's no end to it,|but there could be.
{34567}{34659}It's my dream that one day|all this rot will be wiped away.
{34660}{34744}A new order will prevail,|one that will end the chaos...
{34745}{34798}...but it won't be built|by the faint of heart.
{34799}{34982}You got soft on me back there,|Earth boy, and that I will not tolerate.
{34983}{35062}Everything okay?|We heard there was a disturbance.
{35063}{35098}We're fine.
{35099}{35143}Hey, you got Cuchie.
{35144}{35183}Don't he look peaceful.
{35184}{35383}I'm taking him to the nearest substation.|I want everyone with me.
{35384}{35451}- You all right?|- Yeah.
{35452}{35514}Swell.
{35875}{35933}Ugh.
{35949}{35989}Mind if I join you?
{35990}{36103}Might hurt your reputation.
{36118}{36148}Give them time.
{36149}{36187}You have to understand...
{36188}{36257}...Abin Sur, everyone loved him.
{36258}{36303}He had family, friends.
{36304}{36374}He was irreplaceable.
{36375}{36410}Any news on Cuch?
{36411}{36482}- They took him to interrogation.|- Who's asking the questions?
{36483}{36572}Who do you think?
{36645}{36782}- Ouch.|- I know. Sinestro can be difficult.
{36783}{36842}All right, he can be pretty damn arrogant.
{36843}{36932}Some of us are starting to worry about him,|but he's under a lot of pressure.
{36933}{37006}- Yeah, saving the universe or something.|- That's right.
{37007}{37044}Cuch is just a bit player.
{37045}{37123}The one we're really after|is his boss, Kanjar Ro.
{37124}{37156}He's just a warlord.
{37157}{37185}Not anymore.
{37186}{37287}- Not since he found the yellow element.|- Should I be taking notes?
{37288}{37354}This story goes back as far|as time itself...
{37355}{37471}...when the only sentient beings|were the Guardians.
{37472}{37518}They built the lantern battery...
{37519}{37616}...long before the creation|of the Corps.
{37617}{37694}The battery would power all the rings|with the green element...
{37695}{37752}...the greatest energy source|in the universe.
{37753}{37814}Where it comes from|only the Guardians know.
{37815}{37892}But once it was installed,|the Guardians had the ultimate weapon...
{37893}{37968}...to maintain peace and promote justice|in the galaxies.
{37969}{38067}Unfortunately, the battery|had one vulnerability, the color yellow.
{38068}{38142}It's one part of the light spectrum|that can resist the green...
{38143}{38208}...and the most concentrated source|of yellow energy...
{38209}{38240}...is the yellow element.
{38241}{38362}For eons, the Guardians had it hidden|underground in another dimension...
{38363}{38432}...until Kanjar Ro found out.
{38433}{38482}When the Guardians|discovered the theft...
{38483}{38563}...they called for an emergency meeting|with the senior Lanterns.
{38564}{38646}Abin Sur offered to go undercover.
{38647}{38702}Within days, he had infiltrated|Ro's ship...
{38703}{38758}...but there was no sign|of the yellow element.
{38759}{38829}Kanjar Ro had taken it somewhere.
{38830}{39053}Abin Sur was about to report back|to the Guardians when he was found out.
{39901}{39944}That's the way I heard it.
{39945}{39998}From there,|Abin Sur made his way to Earth.
{39999}{40102}- And now you're here.|- Jeez.
{40103}{40182}- You captured Cuch by yourself.|- He tell you that?
{40183}{40246}No. I was in your head.
{40247}{40306}Interesting.
{40307}{40379}As you know, Kanjar Ro|was forced to abandon his ship...
{40380}{40426}...after Abin Sur's escape.
{40427}{40461}Now he's on the move again.
{40462}{40498}I just found out from Cuch...
{40499}{40597}...that Ro and his men are meeting at|the Kadian Space Terminal at 1700 hours.
{40598}{40707}That's it? That's all you got?
{40708}{40745}Not that it isn't significant.
{40746}{40862}No. It's good to know.|Needed. Necessary even.
{40863}{40936}I want everyone back here|at 1600 hours.
{40937}{40995}We'll leave together.|Are there any questions?
{40996}{41080}If not, then...
{41175}{41247}Excuse me.
{41302}{41402}This is not the first time|we've had to reprimand you, Sinestro.
{41403}{41470}This cruelty is hardly the Guardian way.
{41471}{41500}He was resistant.
{41501}{41538}It made the process difficult.
{41539}{41599}- I did my best.|- We should have been called.
{41600}{41670}We might have been able|to use our telepathy to draw him out.
{41671}{41706}Time is running out.
{41707}{41780}And we're facing a foe|who is hell-bent on destroying us.
{41781}{41846}The Green Lantern Corps|is an ideal, Sinestro.
{41847}{41926}You don't save it|by ignoring what it stands for.
{41927}{41996}This must not happen to Kanjar Ro.
{41997}{42074}The moment he is captured,|he is to be brought to us.
{42075}{42114}We'll do the questioning.
{42115}{42158}Is that understood?
{42159}{42229}Yes, sir.
{42321}{42422}They will doom us all.
{42899}{42966}I'll need someone|to watch this outer perimeter. Ch'p?
{42967}{43001}I always get the stink jobs.
{43002}{43051}- Let the new guy do it.|- Whatever.
{43052}{43130}Fine. Let's go.
{43131}{43246}Don't trip over the luggage.
{43517}{43555}Attention, travelers.
{43556}{43620}We apologize|for this interruption in service.
{43621}{43717}The Green Lantern Corps has requested|a routine scan of the spaceport.
{43718}{43946}There is nothing to be concerned about.|Operations will resume momentarily.
{44053}{44120}That red-faced swine|wants to flush me out.
{44121}{44197}What should we do?
{44198}{44260}Leave.
{44287}{44374}The room. Get out.
{44375}{44500}I'll let you know when I'm done.
{44773}{44822}I am here.
{44823}{44889}Make yourself present.
{44890}{44962}Sinestro, I'm calling.
{44963}{45071}Make your presence known.
{45180}{45218}I'm here.
{45219}{45268}What kind of stunt|are you trying to pull?
{45269}{45306}You're a hard man to reach.
{45307}{45350}What do you want, a daily briefing?
{45351}{45438}It's dangerous to talk, even like this,|especially with Abin Sur dead.
{45439}{45514}Communication, Ro. It goes two ways.
{45515}{45564}I swear I'm not squeezing you out.
{45565}{45624}- Where's the yellow element?|- With the Weaponers.
{45625}{45686}The weapon is ready for pickup.|We don't have long.
{45687}{45727}- Where?|- I'm gonna tell you...
{45728}{45767}...surrounded by your pack dogs?
{45768}{45811}Don't try me, Ro.
{45812}{45916}I've put everything on the line for this:|the Corps, the future, my life.
{45917}{45970}I am not going|to be given the runaround.
{45971}{46050}Tell you what, we go to the Weaponers|together, just you and me.
{46051}{46110}You get rid of your boys,|I'll get rid of mine.
{46111}{46162}- Where are you?|- In a waiting room.
{46163}{46213}I'll meet you at Station|50 in half an hour.
{46214}{46255}But if I see one|ring anywhere...
{46256}{46338}Just be there.
{46384}{46511}Tomar, we have a change of plans.
{46517}{46554}Come on. We're leaving.
{46555}{46582}But the rings...
{46583}{46669}Use your faders.
{46919}{46954}Jordan?
{46955}{47020}- Tell me you got him.|- Not yet. How are you doing?
{47021}{47112}So far I've seen 10 shooting stars,|one supernova and a baggage handler.
{47113}{47230}Tomar says Sinestro wants|to re-deploy most of us to the next port.
{47231}{47323}Get over to the south perimeter.|Tomar is meeting us there.
{47324}{47389}Uh-huh.
{47443}{47484}You okay?
{47485}{47588}Yeah. Something hit me.
{47628}{47700}Stay here.
{48512}{48601}Hold it, bug boy.
{49351}{49421}Aah!|Aah!
{49892}{49954}Jordan, where are you?
{49955}{50084}Got a little pest-control problem.
{50533}{50593}Where is Kanjar Ro?
{50594}{50654}Sinestro.|He's heading for the west gates.
{50655}{50796}Do whatever it takes.|I need him alive.
{50938}{51000}Rings!
{52880}{52971}- Nice move.|- Hm.
{53052}{53160}All right, one at a time.
{53169}{53210}What are you doing? Where's Ro?
{53211}{53279}- Sinestro, these people...|- These people are irrelevant.
{53280}{53343}The Corps is on the line.|Get that through your heads.
{53344}{53407}None of us,|and therefore none of them are safe...
{53408}{53444}...until we get Kanjar Ro.
{53445}{53651}I don't care if we have to tear|this place apart girder by girder.
{53689}{53747}It's him.
{53748}{53839}- Unh. Ooh!|- Ugh!
{53965}{54032}Push it.
{55040}{55157}- Huh? Yeah.|- You all right?
{55373}{55414}Good shot.
{55415}{55597}- They're going to reach us.|- Time to lighten the load.
{55832}{55904}Holy crap!
{55944}{56047}We have to get through.
{56177}{56338}There's a rift ahead.|We can get out home free.
{56722}{56760}It's that guy from the port.
{56761}{56876}So why are you sitting here?
{58791}{58849}Unh!
{59355}{59413}Ugh.
{59434}{59513}One bug left.
{60212}{60313}I'd power down if I were you.
{60314}{60379}I'm the only one who knows|where the Weaponers are.
{60380}{60512}Without me, you'll never find them.
{60533}{60665}Take me in, and I'll implicate you,|I swear.
{60666}{60858}Come on, Sinestro. Put the ring down.|We can still work this out.
{60859}{60922}- Sinestro?|- I'm thinking.
{60923}{60962}What's there to think about?
{60963}{61064}Plan B. It could work.
{61184}{61216}Sinestro.
{61217}{61275}Yes.
{61535}{61607}Down here.
{61830}{61903}You entered the pilot's cabin on your own.
{61904}{61932}Yes, sir.
{61933}{62012}- And you did not see Kanjar Ro?|- No, sir.
{62013}{62074}And you have no recollection|of killing him?
{62075}{62108}I did not kill him.
{62109}{62186}Someone did,|and he wore a Green Lantern ring.
{62187}{62229}You were the first ones there.
{62230}{62309}Actually, Tomar Re and Boodikka|arrived on the scene first...
{62310}{62352}...but I was there soon after.
{62353}{62406}We followed the ship's|vapor trail separately.
{62407}{62462}- And no one else was on the ship?|- No.
{62463}{62528}But I think it's perfectly|understandable what happened.
{62529}{62586}The human was attacked|by Kanjar Ro...
{62587}{62672}...and in his last moments|of consciousness, he struck back.
{62673}{62726}A clear case of self-defense.
{62727}{62789}He should never have put himself|in that situation.
{62790}{62830}If he hadn't played hero...
{62831}{62914}...you might have caught up with the ship|and taken Kanjar Ro alive.
{62915}{63001}Now there's no telling into whose hands|the yellow element might fall.
{63002}{63046}Perhaps you'd like to say something?
{63047}{63094}I didn't kill him.
{63095}{63127}Then who did?
{63128}{63201}Whoever took his Energi-Rod.|I sure as hell don't have it.
{63202}{63241}By your brash actions...
{63242}{63317}...you have placed the universe|in absolute turmoil.
{63318}{63373}Excuse me, but the turmoil began...
{63374}{63463}...when the yellow element was stolen|under your watch.
{63464}{63519}We've heard enough.|Indeed.
{63520}{63645}Hal Jordan, it greatly disappoints me|that in the judgment of this tribunal...
{63646}{63715}...you have been found|of insufficient discipline...
{63716}{63784}...to carry on the duties|of a Green Lantern.
{63785}{63906}Will the sergeant-at-arms|please come forth?
{63907}{64077}You shall hand your ring over|to Commander Kilowog.
{64312}{64446}Kilowog, you will keep the ring|until the Guardians choose its successor.
{64447}{64486}And what of the yellow element?
{64487}{64573}I suggest we call a special session|with our honor guard...
{64574}{64627}...to devise our next strategy.
{64628}{64663}I can arrange that, sir.
{64664}{64827}If there is nothing more,|this tribunal is over.
{65424}{65453}Are you my ride home?
{65454}{65563}We both volunteered.|Kilowog has something to say to you.
{65564}{65629}I'm sorry I said the things|I said about you.
{65630}{65719}You saved my life. You are a brave|and bold Green Lantern.
{65720}{65806}Thanks, Kilowog.
{65811}{65940}- You gonna eat that?|- Go for it.
{66090}{66153}- Quite a day, huh?|- I'm sorry.
{66154}{66215}- Did you notice how calm he was?|- Who?
{66216}{66299}Sinestro. He even defended me,|in a half-assed way.
{66300}{66333}He's always been political.
{66334}{66408}Would he have known where|the Guardians hid the yellow element?
{66409}{66471}- They trust him.|- He hates them, you know.
{66472}{66516}He's critical.
{66517}{66605}Uh-uh. No, no. He can't stand them.
{66606}{66695}What did the Guardian mean when he said|the Energi-Rod might be helpful?
{66696}{66748}Kanjar Ro controlled|it through his thoughts.
{66749}{66801}It might contain some|psionic information.
{66802}{66849}Like where he put the yellow element?
{66850}{66961}Ranakar doesn't know his butt|from his poozer.
{66962}{66994}Even if you had the rod...
{66995}{67063}...you can't use it|without Kanjar Ro's brainwaves...
{67064}{67181}...and that transmitter|has been shut off for good.
{67182}{67319}- Are you ready?|- Are we in a hurry?
{67697}{67774}This is him.
{68272}{68325}I know it's cold, Kanjar Ro.
{68326}{68388}I'm sorry about that.
{68389}{68419}Where...?
{68420}{68472}You're in the morgue. You're dead.
{68473}{68532}- Dead?|- I killed you.
{68533}{68640}I'm reconnecting synapses for some|information. This shouldn't take long.
{68641}{68696}You remember the yellow element, right?
{68697}{68728}Yellow.
{68729}{68821}You left it with the Weaponers.|Where are they?
{68822}{68868}Qwar...
{68869}{68923}One more time.
{68924}{68974}Qwar-
{68975}{69138}Perhaps you can show me.|Let's sit up, shall we?
{69188}{69401}All right, now. Where are the Weaponers?|Where is the yellow element?
{69528}{69615}Sector 324. Very good.
{69616}{69724}Can you be more specific?
{69848}{69907}- Qward.|- Wow.
{69908}{70045}Can you find the nearest pizza joint too?
{70046}{70125}Well, well, this is a surprise.
{70126}{70177}What's going on, Sinestro?
{70178}{70218}It's fairly evident, Kilowog.
{70219}{70291}I've been working behind the scenes|to find the yellow element.
{70292}{70337}You killed Kanjar Ro.
{70338}{70427}To save his hide.
{70452}{70522}Careful now.|You don't want to damage the Energi-Rod.
{70523}{70595}The core is quite unstable,|I've been told.
{70596}{70633}You lied to the Guardians.
{70634}{70679}I've lied to everyone. I've had to.
{70680}{70719}- Why?|- Think about it.
{70720}{70803}How did Kanjar Ro know exactly|where to find the yellow element?
{70804}{70893}How was Abin Sur killed so quickly?
{70894}{70953}- Are you saying there's a traitor?|- Of course.
{70954}{71017}Why do you think|I wanted to work with Earth boy?
{71018}{71069}At least I could be sure he was clean.
{71070}{71117}You should've told the Guardians.
{71118}{71150}In due time.
{71151}{71219}Let's get the yellow element|first, Kilowog.
{71220}{71307}Then we'll all be heroes.
{71308}{71397}Take off your ring.
{71398}{71459}Don't be ridiculous. Boodikka?
{71460}{71567}Sorry, Sinestro. I don't think|you can talk your way out of this one.
{71568}{71650}- Ugh!|- Jeez.
{71952}{71980}He's still alive.
{71981}{72063}If she had killed him, his ring|would have flown to the Guardians.
{72064}{72131}And we'd rather not have that happen|just yet.
{72132}{72219}It was Jordan's idea to come here.|I was hoping you'd be gone by now.
{72220}{72283}I told you he was bright.
{72284}{72315}You played me.
{72316}{72394}I needed to get inside your head,|see if you should join our club.
{72395}{72429}But you're not easy to read.
{72430}{72501}We really need to talk|about personal space.
{72502}{72545}It's not too late, Jordan.
{72546}{72627}Boodikka believes in my vision.|Others will too.
{72628}{72729}But I could use someone like you|who has the stones to get things done.
{72730}{72778}While the gnomes banish you...
{72779}{72887}...I offer you power,|more power than you can imagine.
{72888}{72973}All I ask is for is your loyalty.
{72974}{73082}Now, you see, you had me.|Right up until that last part.
{73083}{73143}And I thought humans were different.
{73144}{73233}Take care of him.
{73279}{73454}You can hide his body with Ro's.|I shouldn't be long.
{73939}{74042}Knock me out, will you?
{75423}{75488}Humans.
{76283}{76353}Good God.
{77096}{77164}You're a Weaponer.
{77165}{77231}I'm here for the yellow element.
{77232}{77328}You are not the one.
{77337}{77406}Kanjar Ro is dead. I was his partner.
{77407}{77484}He told me to come to Qward|to pick the weapon up here.
{77485}{77612}He paid for it and now it's mine.
{77711}{77855}Listen, I don't have time for this. I...
{78106}{78145}Your friend...
{78146}{78175}...is late.
{78176}{78275}The weapon is now in forfeiture.
{78276}{78372}It is yours to take.
{79125}{79223}This is your control.
{80145}{80225}Our work is done.
{80226}{80372}We leave this world to return to our own.
{80382}{80469}The weapon is a mighty force.
{80470}{80633}The most powerful and absolute|in your universe.
{80635}{80691}With one exception.
{80692}{80723}One...
{80724}{80754}...slight...
{80755}{80831}...imperfection.
{80832}{80861}What?
{80862}{80933}The imperfection...
{80934}{81030}...every weapon has.
{81046}{81116}Its user.
{81629}{81682}So they got Boodikka.
{81683}{81796}I start alone, I end alone.
{81840}{81881}The Guardians want to see you.
{81882}{81922}And I them.
{81923}{81965}What are you doing, Sinestro?
{81966}{82049}Only what's necessary, Tomar.
{82050}{82268}Oh, don't look so glum. The universe|has become too big for the gnomes.
{82416}{82481}There's a new day dawning.
{82482}{82571}A new sun rising.
{82733}{82849}He was our most brilliant|Lantern. A paragon of duty and service.
{82850}{82896}The cleverest of them all.
{82897}{82985}Perhaps too clever, Ranakar.|We should have seen the signs.
{82986}{83108}Until Sinestro gets an opportunity|to explain himself, I remain skeptical.
{83109}{83188}One thing's for sure,|you took the ring off the wrong guy.
{83189}{83316}You ask me, you should give it back.
{83317}{83408}When you're ready.
{83695}{83769}It's lost its power.
{83770}{83832}Tomar.
{83847}{83941}He killed them all.
{84699}{84751}So it is true.
{84752}{84829}Yes, Ganthet.|A new command is at hand.
{84830}{84906}- A new authority.|- How dare you?
{84907}{85010}- It's an affront to-|- Shut your mouth, you stupid little troll!
{85011}{85079}You're nothing but a clutch|of bickering old biddies,
{85080}{85123}ineffectual and|obstructionist.
{85124}{85217}In a galaxy screaming for order,|you have cast a deaf ear...
{85218}{85289}...but all that ends now.
{85290}{85349}As demigods bound by your word...
{85350}{85475}...all of you are going to pledge|your undying allegiance to me.
{85476}{85507}Like hell!
{85508}{85623}For once, Ranakar, we agree.
{85846}{85949}Give this up, Sinestro.
{86135}{86193}Unh!
{86219}{86285}It must be difficult to relinquish power.
{86286}{86408}Let me give you some incentive.
{86824}{87004}You will have nothing.|Not even your lives, in the end.
{87168}{87250}Gotta go, guy.
{88335}{88409}Stand back.
{89350}{89420}Good man.
{89886}{89968}What the hell?
{89997}{90081}Happy landings.
{90208}{90280}It's dead.
{92129}{92189}The Lanterns.
{92190}{92295}Yes, all the ones in space,|with no power and no protection.
{92296}{92390}You are generals without an army,|in a war you cannot win.
{92391}{92436}How many more have to die?
{92437}{92508}Enough, Sinestro. Please.
{92509}{92631}We will accede to your demands.
{92867}{92961}Come on, get green!
{93031}{93115}Oh, son of a...
{93195}{93253}Aah!
{93777}{93861}The rings. Now.
{94503}{94667}Frankly, Kilowog, you weren't going|to survive this anyway.
{94668}{94726}Huh?
{95695}{95779}I'll be damned.
{95835}{95897}And you thought I was green before.
{95898}{95963}Jordan.
{97537}{97582}- Do you see him?|- I...
{97583}{97662}I can't tell.
{99200}{99317}The bastard's here somewhere.
{100789}{100833}It's over, Sinestro.
{100834}{100913}I still have plenty of|juice left in this ring.
{100914}{101046}Enough to take|yours for insurance.
{101206}{101241}You're not strong enough.
{101242}{101362}Just takes a little incentive.
{103518}{103609}Excuse me, poozer.
{103764}{103797}Jordan, can you hear me?
{103798}{103850}Come in, Jordan.
{103851}{103909}Where are you?
{103910}{104023}Falling. I forgot my chute.
{104485}{104517}Very creative.
{104518}{104633}Hey, I got a few tricks too.
{104757}{104823}Though we continue|to mourn those who have fallen...
{104824}{104899}...during the tragic betrayal|of recent days...
{104900}{104997}...we also celebrate our resiliency.
{104998}{105093}Our battery is repaired,|our rings replenished...
{105094}{105176}...and our battle|against the dark forces continues.
{105177}{105257}If we have learned anything|from our last battle...
{105258}{105380}...it is that great evil can arise|from the most unexpected sources...
{105381}{105527}...but, most thankfully,|so can great heroism.
{105528}{105608}I've asked Ganthet|to lead us in our pledge.
{105609}{105665}If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...
{105666}{105813}...I'd like to give that privilege|to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.
{105814}{105886}Hear, hear.
{105887}{105921}What's the matter?
{105922}{106061}I just learned the thing this morning.
{106099}{106145}In brightest day...
{106146}{106273}In blackest night,|no evil shall escape my sight.
{106274}{106348}Let those who worship evil's might...
{106349}{106498}...beware my power,|Green Lantern's light!
{106636}{106664}I'm off.
{106665}{106700}Where are you going?
{106701}{106777}I've gotta go punch a clock|with my other boss.
{106778}{106941}I can see where this is gonna be|a long commute.
