I SPIT ON YOU.

366
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:19.681
[grunts]

367
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:24.363
NEXT TIME YOU PRESENT ME

368
00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:26.654
WITH ONE OF YOUR
LITTLE SLUTS, MOTHER DEAR,

369
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.073
I'LL SQUASH YOU LIKE A BUG.

370
00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:35.371
(Nekron)
GET THAT GARBAGE OUT OF HERE.

371
00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:41.786
[screams]

372
00:56:04.153 --> 00:56:06.019
[all howling]

373
00:56:23.964 --> 00:56:25.296
[screaming]

374
00:56:30.345 --> 00:56:31.677
DON'T LOOK UP.

375
00:56:31.764 --> 00:56:33.426
WE ARE RIDERS OF FIRE KEEP.

376
00:56:33.515 --> 00:56:35.177
WE PAY NO HEED TO SUCH TRASH.

377
00:57:51.552 --> 00:57:53.965
WE HAVE COME, LORD NEKRON,

378
00:57:54.054 --> 00:57:56.546
TO NEGOTIATE
BETWEEN OUR 2 PEOPLES.

379
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.428
AND THE RETURN TO FIRE KEEP
OF MY SISTER, TEEGRA,

380
00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:02.306
WHOM YOUR WARRIORS
BASELY KIDNAPPED.

381
00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:05.980
(Taro)
MY FATHER, KING JAROL,
HAS EMPOWERED ME

382
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.438
TO OFFER A PEACE
BETWEEN OUR KINGDOMS

383
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:13.404
IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS
CONTINUED SOVEREIGNTY

384
00:58:13.824 --> 00:58:15.440
AND MY SISTER'S FREEDOM.

385
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:17.867
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT MY ENVOYS MADE

386
00:58:17.953 --> 00:58:20.240
A SIMILAR OFFER NOT LONG SINCE

387
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.534
AND THAT IT WAS SPURNED
BY YOUR ILLUSTRIOUS SIRE.

388
00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:28.119
YOU KNOW FULL WELL, NEKRON,
THAT OFFER WAS MADE

389
00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:30.296
BEFORE YOUR MINIONS
KIDNAPPED MY SISTER.

390
00:58:30.382 --> 00:58:31.884
(Nekron)
I FEAR, GOOD PRINCE,

391
00:58:31.967 --> 00:58:33.754
I CANNOT OFFER
PEACE TO A PEOPLE

392
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:37.633
WHO HAVE REFUSED TO PROCLAIM ME
THEIR RIGHTFUL OVERLORD.

393
00:58:40.893 --> 00:58:43.010
AS TO YOUR SISTER...

394
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:46.812
WELL, I MUST ADMIT
THAT UNTIL THIS MOMENT

395
00:58:46.899 --> 00:58:51.109
THE IDEA OF MATING WITH HER
FILLED ME WITH LOATHING.

396
00:58:51.195 --> 00:58:53.152
PERHAPS I SHOULD RECONSIDER.

397
00:58:54.448 --> 00:58:57.566
YOUR SISTER, AFTER ALL,
IS NOT WHOLLY UNATTRACTIVE.

398
00:58:57.659 --> 00:58:58.649
HMM?

399
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.327
AS LESSER BEASTS GO.

400

402
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:20.797
PIG YOU ARE.

403
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.808
AND LIKE A PIG SHALL YOU DIE.

404
00:59:41.161 --> 00:59:42.697

405
00:59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.295
[groans]

406
01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.911
[screaming]
NO!

407
01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.351
[grunts]

408
01:00:58.363 --> 01:01:00.104
OH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

409
01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.709
YOU INTEREST ME.

410
01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.378
GUARDS!

411
01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.956
BRING HIM TO ME.

412
01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.262
RELEASE HIM.

413
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:27.719
[metallic rattling]

414
01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.391
WHY HAVE YOU COME SEEKING ME?

415
01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.022
YOU KILLED MY PEOPLE.

416
01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:43.155
WE'VE HAD TO DISPOSE OF
SO MANY UNDESIRABLES OF LATE.

417
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.335

418

[Nekron laughs]

420
01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:15.748
(Nekron)
LET HIM REST.
THERE IS STILL FIGHT IN HIM.

421
01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:48.864
[Larn grunting]

422
01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:07.716

423
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.430
LARN. LARN!

424
01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:15.970
LARN. LARN.

425
01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.178
TEEGRA, IS THAT YOU?

426
01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:20.262
SHH.

427
01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:21.771
TEEGRA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

428
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.690
YES. I'M TRYING
TO UNLOCK THE DOOR.

429
01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.439
NEVER MIND THE DOOR,
YOU'VE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

430
01:04:25.529 --> 01:04:26.895
I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT YOU.

431
01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:28.490
MAYBE I CAN GET
A KEY SOMEHOW.

432
01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:29.984
NO, TEEGRA, DON'T.

433
01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:41.618
[speaking gibberish]

434
01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.963

[growls]

440
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.196
IS HE CERTAIN?

441
01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.740
IT WAS MY SON YOU SAW?

442
01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:23.742
THEY CALLED HIM PRINCE TARO.

443
01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.956
HE DIED.

444
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.083
OH.

445
01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.161
(Darkwolf)
WHAT ABOUT TEEGRA?

446
01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:31.791
HE'S GOT HER, TOO.

447
01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.668
MAYBE SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

448
01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:34.839
IT'S A CHANCE.

449
01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:38.294
BELIEVE WHAT YOU WANT,
BUT THAT GLACIER IS A FACT.

450
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:44.100
FOR 3 DAYS AND NIGHTS
IT'S BEEN PUSHING SOUTH.

451
01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:48.562
A THOUSAND SOULS LOST
BECAUSE OF NEKRON'S RAGE.

452
01:07:48.648 --> 01:07:52.312
FIRE KEEP IS NEXT.
WE MUST ATTACK.

453
01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.314
I NEED THE DRAGONHAWKS.

454
01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.111
THE DRAGONHAWKS ARE TOO FEW.

455
01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.859
ENOUGH TO GET IN WITH.

456
01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:01.658
ONE US MIGHT GET
THROUGH AND DESTROY HIM.

457
01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.616
BUT IF THAT GLACIER
PASSES BEYOND THE RIVER,

458
01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.493
I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE.

459
01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:09.659
(Jarol)
I WILL HAVE TO
RELEASE THE LAVA.
