1
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.390
And her ambition was to extend her realm...

2
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.690
to all the regions of the known world.

3
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.860
To this end, she gathered an army.

4
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.830
And she bore a son and named him Nekron.

5
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.600
And him she tutored in the black arts
and in the powers of the mind.

6
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.800
And when Nekron came of age...

7
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.610
and attained mastery of those powers...

8
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.380
together they seized control
of the region of Ice.

9
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.880
And from their castle called Ice Peak...

10
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.920
they sent a giant glacier
rumbling southward.

11
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.690
No village or people could stand
against its relentless onslaught.

12
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.560
And so the remnants of humanity
fled south...

13
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.600
and huddled for warmth
among the volcanoes...

14
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.300
of a mountain region
ruled by a generous king named Jarol...

15
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.000
from his fortress,
which men called Fire Keep.

16
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.240
And still Nekron
pushed the Ice ever southward...

17
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.220
into the temperate zone toward Fire Keep.

18
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.690
And no one dared guess at the outcome...

19
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.810
of a meeting on the field of battle...

20
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.050
between Fire and Ice.

21
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.860
Hold your positions, men. Steady.

22
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.180
Lam, it cannot be stopped.
Join your brother.

23
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.210
You have done well, my son.

24
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.580
The North Village has fallen. We have won.

25
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.250
I want to thank you, Mother.

26
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.850
The Great Plain is all that stands
between ourselves and Fire Keep.

27
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.480
That is a long distance.

28
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.890
A distance we may not have to travel.

29
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.430
I am sending our envoys to Jarol
with our new demands.

30
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.470
- He will not submit.
- Perhaps.

31
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.630
You will present our demands to King Jarol
at Fire Keep and...

32
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.470
give our royal regards
to his lovely daughter.

33
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.440
But, Father, I want to be with you
when you meet Nekron's men.

34
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.810
You will serve your people better here
with your studies, my daughter.

35
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.280
Give me your love.

36
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.440
You have it always, Father.

37
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.590
All matter in our world
is from the natural bases...

38
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.070
which are earth, air, fire and water.

39
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.940
The four elements
from which all things are created.

40
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.110
How can you talk about elements
when the war draws nearer to us ever hour?

41
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.810
Princess Teegra, we all have our duty.

42
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.510
Your father's duty is to be king and lead.

43
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.720
Your brother's duty is to soldier.
And your duty is to learn.

44
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.190
You mean my duty is to stay shut up...

45
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.630
while all the men do the fighting
and share all the glory.

46
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.360
We think that stinks.

47
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.830
Don't we, Shaitan?

48
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.910
If you peacefully surrender, my lord Nekron
will cease the destruction of...

49
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.570
This is your message of peace?

50
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.710
A demand for our total
and unconditional surrender?

51
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.450
We call it an offer of alliance, Your Majesty.

52
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.450
I call it blackmail.

53
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.390
My lord Nekron's offer...

54
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.830
To hell with Nekron and his offer.
We are free men, not slaves.

55
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.460
King Jarol, be reasonable.

56
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.700
My son, Taro, speaks more with his heart
than with his head.

57
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.600
But he speaks for all of us.

58
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.570
There can be no alliance.

59
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.010
We will fight you to the death.

60
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.510
Perhaps, you will soon change your mind.

61
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.860
No!

62
00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:08.560
Teegra!

63
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.490
Guards!

64
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.440
Make for the glacier. Man the Dragonhawks.

65
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.540
Hurry!

66
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.600
The Dragonhawks will find her, Father.
They've got to.

67
00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:58.270
The night's so dark, the jungle so thick.
A bird couldn't find its own nest.

68
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.550
- What do we do then, Father?
- We wait.

69
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:08.280
- For Nekron's new demands?
- For his siege!

70
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.900
What is your report?
Have you done as I commanded?

71
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.000
Have you captured the girl, Teegra,
Jarol's daughter?

72
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.470
Where is she?

73
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.510
Bring her forth that I may see her.

74
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.410
- Gone.
- Gone?

75
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.890
Gone!

76
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.520
Escaped? You filth-spawned scum!

77
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.200
What punishment does failure demand?

78
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.030
Death.

79
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:35.680
Find the girl.
Find her, or his punishment shall be yours.

80
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.840
Gods of my father.

81
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.760
What do you want?

82
00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.840
If you want it, take it.

83
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.750
I am not a thief.

84
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.520
Not so close, you'll burn it.

85
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.090
I've always lived close to a fire.

86
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.800
Sometimes in the night, I'm so afraid.

87
00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.020
It's getting colder.

88
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.560
- Cold comes from Nekron.
- I know.

89
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:21.110
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home to my people.

90
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.420
- Where is home?
- Far away, to the south.

91
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.630
- I'm going south, too.
- Yeah?

92
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.720
You can come along if you behave yourself.

93
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.770
If I behave myself?

94
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:40.700
No.

95
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:25.680
Larn.

96
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.730
You've caught me,
but you'll never hand me over to Nekron.

97
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.700
You'll have to kill me first.

98
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.060
Don't hunt for death, boy.

99
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.470
It finds us all soon enough.

100
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:38.810
The travois was to keep you
from killing yourself till you're all healed.

101
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:42.120
You need rest and food.

102
00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.900
If you're gonna kill the Ice Lord, boy,
you better learn to live with pain.

103
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.860
Ice Lord? You mean you're fighting Nekron?

104
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.760
Him and his mother.

105
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.270
That wolf bitch, Juliana.

106
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.990
Teegra!

107
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.450
They were here.

108
00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.260
Nekron's dogs, they got the girl.

109
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.130
They took her west.

110
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.970
Guard Teegra.

111
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.650
They camped less than two miles from here.

112
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.880
Come.

113
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.740
I saw the girl before.
She is on the far side of the big tree.

114
00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.180
You go get her out,
and I'll distract the others.

115
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.310
- There must be 50 of them.
- That sounds about right.

116
00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.700
- Where's the girl?
- I couldn't find her.

117
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.130
- No!
- The horses!

118
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.030
No, they'd be on our heels
before we could reach them.

119
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.340
- But Teegra's still back there.
- Then we'll come back for her.

120
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:12.040
First, we lead the Nekron's dogs
on a wild chase.

121
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.170
Come.

122
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.560
We'll take our stand up there. Come.

123
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.000
Enough!

124
00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:19.680
I want you to go to Nekron,
to his mother, Juliana.

125
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.310
- We must negotiate.
- With the enemy?

126
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.780
No man is wholly evil.

127
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.080
Surely there is some way
to appeal to Nekron.

128
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.750
You expect his mercy?

129
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.020
Father, do you know what he will do
if I enter his land under a flag of truce?

130
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:36.750
We have no choice!

131
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.220
We must take that risk.

132
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.030
You must take that risk, my son,
for the sake of Fire Keep.

133
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.070
For the sake of your sister.

134
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.300
Go, ride swiftly.

135
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.360
Welcome to my hearth.

136
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.700
I am Roliel and these woods are my home.

137
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.110
You've had a trying journey.

138
00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.840
Please let me give you some food and drink.

139
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:30.780
First, you shall rest. Then we will talk.

140
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.550
Poor, poor darling.

141
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.390
Did Great Otwa frighten you?

142
00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:42.790
You mustn't be afraid.
He's as gentle as a child.

143
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.960
I saw him twist a chain apart
with his bare hands.

144
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.030
Yes, he is strong, my sweet.

145
00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:00.040
But he means well, my darling.
He brought you to me, did he not?

146
00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.310
I'm so tired.

147
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.980
Yes, my poor, poor darling.

148
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.060
Yes, you're so tired...

149
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.350
and so beautiful.

150
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.190
You must...

151
00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.420
Tell me your secrets.

152
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:47.710
Nekron?

153
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.730
The girl is wanted by Nekron? The bitch!

154
00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.660
She brings danger into my house!

155
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.870
Perhaps I can turn this to my advantage.

156
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.780
Otwa, my son.

157
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.750
Go and bring the subhumans,
Nekron's dogs.

158
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.620
Tell them we have the girl that he wants.

159
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.920
Tell them he can have her, for a price.

160
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.650
Kill.

161
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.160
Get out of here.

162
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.830
- No.
- The hell you won't.

163
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.370
Go find the girl.

164
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.670
Enter, my son. It is not barred.

165
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.550
What's wrong with you?
Where are the dogs?

166
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.990
You would do this...

167
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:58.810
Why do the living...

168
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.010
disturb the sleep of the dead?

169
00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:08.850
I followed a trail. I seek a girl, Teegra.

170
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:11.260
A girl?

171
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:16.490
Yes. She did this to me.

172
00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.970
She and Nekron.

173
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.800
Cursed Nekron.

174
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:25.930
Where can I find her?

175
00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:33.450
- Why should I answer?
- For revenge against Nekron.

176
00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.320
Nekron?

177
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:43.990
Akatar. They take her to Akatar.

178
00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.260
And from there to the Icy King's realm.

179
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.630
Avenge me.

180
00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:54.600
Avenge me!

181
00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:57.970
Akatar.

182
00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.960
Teegra!

183
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:39.380
My Prince, all is arranged.

184
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.380
I've hired a ship. It waits for us at the dock.

185
00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:44.680
Nekron waits at Ice Peak.

186
00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.260
Get the gangplanks aboard.
Move, you scum!

187
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.330
We must be well on our way before sunrise.

188
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.310
Why have you brought me this?

189
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.180
This is your bride, my son.

190
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.190
She will be mother to your sons.

191
00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.890
How thoughtful, Mother.

192
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.600
I need no bride, and no sons.

193
00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:36.040
- But you need heirs.
- I need nothing!

194
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:37.530
Nekron?

195
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.240
Nekron, you're a great power in the world.

196
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:52.080
You have all that any man ever wants
or needed.

197
00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.350
And yet you despair.

198
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:58.750
For there is one thing you lack.

199
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.460
One gift that only you can bestow
between our people.

200
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:07.230
Peace.

201
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:11.170
This is the gift that heals the heart
of the giver.

202
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:15.810
Nekron, I extend my hand in friendship.

203
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:19.070
I offer peace between our people.

204
00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.450
Will you not take my hand?

205
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:27.920
Will you not call me friend?

206
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:09.020
Woman...

207
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.570
I spit on peace.

208
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:17.200
I spit on you.

209
00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:27.210
Next time you present me
with one of your little sluts, Mother dear...

210
00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.650
I'll squash you like a bug.

211
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:35.920
Get that garbage out of here.

212
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:32.680
Don't look up.

213
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.190
We are riders of Fire Keep.
We pay no heed to such trash.

214
00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:57.230
We have come, Lord Nekron,
to negotiate between our two peoples.

215
00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.370
And the return to Fire Keep
of my sister, Teegra...

216
00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:03.000
whom your warriors basely kidnapped.

217
00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:06.670
My father, King Jarol, has empowered me...

218
00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.750
to offer a peace between our kingdoms...

219
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:14.110
in exchange for his continued sovereignty...

220
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.210
and my sister's freedom.

221
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:21.190
It seems to me that my envoys made
a similar offer not long since...

222
00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:26.090
and that it was spurned
by your illustrious sire.

223
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.790
You know full well, Nekron,
that offer was made...

224
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:31.270
before your minions kidnapped my sister.

225
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.800
I fear, Good Prince,
I cannot offer peace to a people...

226
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:38.670
who have refused to proclaim me
their rightful overlord.

227
00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.810
As to your sister...

228
00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.610
I must admit that until this moment...

229
00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.640
the idea of mating with her
filled me with loathing.

230
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.860
Perhaps I should reconsider.

231
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:58.320
Your sister, after all,
is not wholly unattractive.

232
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.030
As lesser beasts go.

233
00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.480
Pig you are.

234
00:59:22.290 --> 00:59:24.520
And like a pig shall you die.

235
01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:34.090
No!

236
01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.280
No, I don't think so.

237
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:13.860
You interest me.

238
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:15.530
Guards!

239
01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.130
Bring him to me.

240
01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:24.970
Release him.

241
01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:39.520
- Why have you come seeking me?
- You killed my people.

242
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.650
We've had to dispose of
so many undesirables of late.

243
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:16.480
Let him rest. There is still fight in him.

244
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.010
Larn.

245
01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.580
Teegra, is that you?

246
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:24.050
- Teegra, are you all right?
- Yes. I'm trying to unlock the door.

247
01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.150
Never mind the door,
you've to get out of here.

248
01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:29.020
I'm not leaving without you.
Maybe I can get a key somehow.

249
01:04:29.090 --> 01:04:30.530
No, Teegra, don't.

250
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.920
Is he certain?

251
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:24.460
- It was my son you saw?
- They called him Prince Taro.

252
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.490
He died.

253
01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:32.310
- What about Teegra?
- He's got her, too.

254
01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.140
Maybe she's still alive.

255
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:35.540
It's a chance.

256
01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:39.050
Believe what you want,
but that glacier is a fact.

257
01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:44.720
For three days and nights
it's been pushing south.

258
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:48.890
A thousand souls lost
because of Nekron's rage.

259
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:52.620
Fire Keep is next. We must attack.

260
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.990
I need the Dragonhawks.

261
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.660
- The Dragonhawks are too few.
- Enough to get in with.

262
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.940
One us might get through and destroy him.

263
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:07.000
But if that glacier passes beyond the river,
I will have no choice.

264
01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:09.900
I will have to release the lava.

265
01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.640
Teegra.

266
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:03.400
Larn.

267
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.480
Nekron!

268
01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:58.730
Die! Die! Why don't you die?

269
01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.190
No, Larn! No, it's over, don't you see?
We have to start over.
