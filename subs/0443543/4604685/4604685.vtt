00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.426
It's her! I know it's her!
She wants to tell us something!

2
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:55.968
<i>- We must do something!
- Sit down!</i>

3
00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:58.937
<i>- Please!
- Hey!</i>

4
00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:15.477
In the name of His Imperial Majesty
and the city of Vienna...

5
00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:18.956
<i>I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz...</i>

6
00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.926
Also known as Eisenheim
the Illusionist...

7
00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.192
<i>on charges of disturbing public order...</i>

8
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:28.757
<i>Charlatanism and threats
against the empire!</i>

9
00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.032
Leave him alone!

10
00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.604
They're arresting him!
They're arresting Eisenheim!

11
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.236
Chief Inspector Uhl.

12
00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:19.643
- You're late.
- My apologies, Your Highness.

13
00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.688
I was attending to
the loose ends of the case.

14
00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:26.589
- Are there still loose ends?
- Very few.

15
00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.650
Did he do it again?

16
00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:33.292
How does he do it?

17
00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:35.857
<i>I'm afraid I still don't know.</i>

18
00:05:37.604 --> 00:05:39.538
Did you ask him?

19
00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:42.040
He's not talking at this point.

20
00:05:42.108 --> 00:05:45.600
Well, I'm sure
you have... methods...

21
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.340
<i>for that kind of thing.</i>

22
00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.784
I want you to put an end to it.

23
00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:54.945
Surely you have something on him.

24
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.456
<i>Something from his past?</i>

25
00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.928
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

26
00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.470
<i>In fact, we know all about his life.</i>

27
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.533
<i>We've spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him.</i>

28
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.975
<i>As a boy, I'm told
he had a chance encounter...</i>

29
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.920
<i>with a traveling magician.</i>

30
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.658
<i>Boy.</i>

31
00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:11.996
<i>One version
of the story was that the man himself...</i>

32
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.795
<i>then vanished...</i>

33
00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:17.995
<i>along with the tree.</i>

34
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:20.130
<i>Who knows what actually happened?</i>

35
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:39.050
<i>People began to think he had
some kind of special power...</i>

36
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.788
<i>or at least that
he was a bit different.</i>

37
00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:49.725
<i>And then he met her.</i>

38
00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.577
<i>- Don't drop it.
- Careful, you're going to trip.</i>

39
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:06.676
<i>- Drop it, you muck snipe.
- Oh! Watch out for that hole, alley rat!</i>

40
00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.744
- Drop it!
- Come on.

41
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.631
<i>Pick a card.</i>

42
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.867
<i>Put it back in the deck.</i>

43
00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.104
Now, watch.

44
00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:52.455
<i>Duchess von Teschen, you can't be
in a place like this. They're peasants.</i>

45
00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:56.124
Remember who you are.

46
00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:27.291
<i>She was brought back to the castle...</i>

47
00:09:27.367 --> 00:09:29.392
<i>and they were forbidden
to see each other.</i>

48
00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:33.337
<i>But soon, they were doing just that.</i>

49
00:09:33.406 --> 00:09:36.773
<i>Over the next few years, they could
always find a way to be together.</i>

50
00:09:36.843 --> 00:09:40.279
Quick, come on.

51
00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:48.016
<i>In China there's a magician
that could make anything disappear-</i>

52
00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:50.487
<i>a house, a wagon, anything.</i>

53
00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:55.050
<i>We'll go visit him. They can't stop us
if we want to be together.</i>

54
00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:57.494
They'll never find us.

55
00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:00.691
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?

56
00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.201
One day I will.

57
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.966
One day we'll run away together.

58
00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.030
We'll disappear.

59
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.249
There's a secret way to open it.

60
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.588
I wanted a picture.

61
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.074
Sophie, are you there?

62
00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:32.618
<i>- We must hurry! They're coming!
- Duchess von Teschen!</i>

63
00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:37.823
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

64
00:11:37.897 --> 00:11:42.095
<i>- Duchess von Teschen!
- Duchess von Teschen!</i>

65
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:48.270
<i>Make us disappear.
Make us disappear.</i>

66
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:50.775
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

67
00:11:55.515 --> 00:11:57.449
Stop. Stop.

68
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.417
- Don't do this.
- Let go!

69
00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:09.427
- Let me go. Let go!
- Your father's waiting for you.

70
00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:12.828
<i>- Let go!
- No!</i>

71
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.299
- Eduard!
- Please, let go!

72
00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:17.598
- No!
- Let me go!

73
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:21.572
Let her go, please!

74
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:24.337
<i>- Let go! Stop it!
- Sophie!</i>

75
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.344
Eduard!

76
00:12:26.412 --> 00:12:28.312
<i>- Sophie!
- Eduard!</i>

77
00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.941
Sophie.

78
00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:33.110
<i>Stay away from her, or next time...</i>

79
00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:36.018
<i>we'll arrest you and your family.</i>

80
00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:48.966
<i>What happened next remains a mystery.</i>

81
00:12:49.035 --> 00:12:51.902
<i>We do know that
he traveled the world...</i>

82
00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:54.838
<i>that he began to perform
his magic in public...</i>

83
00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:57.637
<i>that he changed his name
to Eisenheim.</i>

84
00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:03.146
<i>And then almost 15 years later...</i>

85
00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.206
<i>he appeared in Vienna.</i>

86
00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.556
<i>Life and death...</i>

87
00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.063
space and time...

88
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.190
fate and chance.

89
00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:24.828
These are the forces
of the universe.

90
00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:27.668
Tonight, ladies and gentleman...

91
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:33.474
I present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries.

92
00:13:33.546 --> 00:13:35.605
From the furthest corners
of the world...

93
00:13:35.681 --> 00:13:39.447
where the dark arts
still hold sway...

94
00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:42.385
he returns to us to demonstrate...

95
00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:46.585
how nature's laws may be bent.

96
00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.686
I give you... Eisenheim.

97
00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:03.071
Might I borrow a handkerchief
from someone?

98
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.902
You, madam.

99
00:14:22.828 --> 00:14:24.796
Thank you.

100
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.890
Ah, be patient.

101
00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.992
Now, if you please.

102
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:36.069
<i>I would like to continue
with an examination of time.</i>

103
00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:40.602
From the moment we enter this life,
we are in the flow of it.

104
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.379
We measure it and we mark it,
but we cannot defy it.

105
00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:48.887
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.

106
00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:53.348
Or can we?

107
00:14:54.627 --> 00:14:56.959
Have we not each
experienced the sensation...

108
00:14:57.029 --> 00:15:00.692
that a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly...

109
00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:03.496
and wished that
we could make it linger?

110
00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:09.375
Or felt time slow on a dull day...

111
00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:13.069
<i>and wished that we could
speed things up a bit?</i>

112
00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:22.242
I assure you, they're quite real.

113
00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.475
Is it real? Let's see.

114
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.951
And you, madam,
where is your handkerchief?

115
00:16:58.317 --> 00:17:01.013
Bravo!

116
00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:03.077
Very good.

117
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.225
<i>Give us something, please.</i>

118
00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:12.059
- Please, give us something. Please.
- What's all this?

119
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.394
We're poor.

120
00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:17.367
- Do you think you're poor?
- Yes.

121
00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:21.167
I want to show you something.

122
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.174
You're not poor.

123
00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:27.269
You have everything
that you need right here.

124
00:17:27.346 --> 00:17:29.337
Thank you.

125
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.707
Thank you.

126
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.711
Thank you.

127
00:17:36.788 --> 00:17:38.779
And that's yours.

128
00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:43.258
And this too.

129
00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:50.133
I've got the magic one!

130
00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:04.607
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:18:04.683 --> 00:18:06.674
- Coffee?
- No.

132
00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:09.983
- Strudel? I have two.
- Nothing, thank you.

133
00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:16.487
You look very pleased with yourself.
How are the receipts?

134
00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:18.689
<i>- Not bad. A three-quarter house.
- Well done.</i>

135
00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:21.164
But we're going to do better
than that. Listen to this.

136
00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:24.999
Listen. "There is no argument
that his uncanny displays...

137
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.666
"separate him from the ranks
of garden-variety stage wizards.

138
00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:32.608
"Some of his effects
transcend mere illusion...

139
00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:35.738
"and approach the realm of art.

140
00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:38.942
He is very young
to be so masterful. "

141
00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:42.953
<i>Do you see?
We'll pack the house with this review.</i>

142
00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:45.455
We are going to make more money
than you ever dreamed of.

143
00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:48.118
<i>But if it was mechanical.</i>

144
00:18:48.193 --> 00:18:50.388
<i>Maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark?</i>

145
00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.521
Oh, I know, of course
I thought of that.

146
00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:54.793
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.

147
00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:57.357
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Invisible wire.

148
00:18:57.436 --> 00:19:00.371
Too obvious. How many men
have you detailed for tonight?

149
00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:03.033
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

150
00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:05.474
<i>Perhaps you'll get another look
at your butterflies.</i>

151
00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.034
Mmm.

152
00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:15.685
<i>- Come on in.
- Check the last 10 rows there.</i>

153
00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.409
<i>You! Don't touch that!</i>

154
00:19:38.477 --> 00:19:40.411
- Put that down!
- Ah, Herr Eisenheim.

155
00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:42.709
Who are you and what do you
think you're doing?

156
00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:46.239
I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.

157
00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.253
I've seen you perform.
Very impressive.

158
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:53.018
<i>- Very impressive.
- How can we help you, Inspector?</i>

159
00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.651
You will be honored to know
the crown prince...

160
00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:57.718
plans to attend
your performance tonight.

161
00:19:57.796 --> 00:19:59.889
<i>- The crown prince?
- Yes!</i>

162
00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.399
<i>So, obviously we have
to inspect the theater.</i>

163
00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:04.662
I think that one's small
for an assassin, don't you?

164
00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:08.399
Yes, the orange tree.

165
00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.805
You know, I have seen things
like this before...

166
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:14.437
but never one like that.

167
00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:16.447
- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.

168
00:20:16.515 --> 00:20:19.484
I have been puzzling
over how it works...

169
00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:23.078
especially how the butterflies fly.

170
00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:27.458
I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.

171
00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:31.622
I'm an officer of the law after all,
and a bit of an amateur conjurer.

172
00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.995
- Are you really?
- Yes.

173
00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:38.196
Well, card tricks, coins,
uh, sleight of hand, yes.

174
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.760
Hmm.

175
00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:44.002
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.

176
00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:48.202
Yes, all right.

177
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.908
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
Are you a gambling man?

178
00:20:50.982 --> 00:20:54.577
- On occasion, yes.
- I will bet you the secret of the orange tree...

179
00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:57.850
that I can guess which hand
you place this in every time.

180
00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:00.585
Excellent.

181
00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:04.356
Put it in your fist, raise your hand
against your forehead...

182
00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:07.421
<i>concentrate on it,
form a mental picture.</i>

183
00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:09.433
<i>- Yes.
- Have you got it?</i>

184
00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:12.163
<i>- Yes.
- Put your hands in front of you.</i>

185
00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:18.106
It's in your left.

186
00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:20.110
- Well-
- A lucky guess, perhaps.

187
00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:22.373
You have a confederate
who signals you.

188
00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:25.439
- No. It's more primitive than that.
- Uh-huh.

189
00:21:25.517 --> 00:21:29.715
When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

190
00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:31.779
It will be paler every time.

191
00:21:35.827 --> 00:21:40.662
Oh. Oh, I like that very much.

192
00:21:40.732 --> 00:21:43.166
Please take it with my compliments.

193
00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:46.170
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

194
00:21:46.238 --> 00:21:49.833
Now, Inspector...

195
00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:52.638
If you don't mind, I've got to prepare
for tonight's performance.

196
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:56.010
Ah.

197
00:22:05.023 --> 00:22:07.924
<i>Please stand for His Imperial Highness...</i>

198
00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.894
<i>Crown Prince Leopold.</i>

199
00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:42.552
I thought we might end this evening
with a discussion of the soul.

200
00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:45.187
All of the greatest religions...

201
00:22:45.263 --> 00:22:49.461
speak of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.

202
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:54.198
So, what then
does it mean... to die?

203
00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:58.103
<i>I need a volunteer
from the audience.</i>

204
00:22:58.176 --> 00:23:01.111
Someone not afraid of death.

205
00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:05.475
Please, someone?

206
00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.916
I assure you,
no tragedy will befall you.

207
00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.942
It's an honor, Duchess von Teschen.

208
00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:55.189
Do you know me?

209
00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:58.099
No.

210
00:24:00.305 --> 00:24:02.865
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?

211
00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.670
Yes, of course.

212
00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:22.323
Now please gaze
directly into my eyes.

213
00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:24.453
Look nowhere else.

214
00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:02.489
Wave to yourself.

215
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.168
Turn in a circle.

216
00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:16.840
Now bow to yourself.

217
00:25:59.591 --> 00:26:01.821
Away.

218
00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:08.621
They must have liked you. They've
waited for you nearly five minutes.

219
00:27:08.693 --> 00:27:13.062
Your Highness, may I introduce
Eisenheim the Illusionist?

220
00:27:17.402 --> 00:27:20.894
- Well done.
- Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoyed it.

221
00:27:20.972 --> 00:27:23.770
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

222
00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:26.606
Stimulated great debate
amongst us, hasn't it?

223
00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:29.078
Except of course for your assistant,
Duchess von Teschen.

224
00:27:29.147 --> 00:27:31.911
You seemed to have struck her
quite speechless. A feat in itself.

225
00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:35.749
- Did you hypnotize her?
- In a fashion.

226
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.880
<i>I'd like to learn that trick.</i>

227
00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:44.259
<i>Rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers.</i>

228
00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.490
Do you claim supernatural powers?

229
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:50.233
I've never said anything
of that kind.

230
00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:53.202
- Then you won't mind a question or two.
- Now let's not ruin it.

231
00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:56.604
<i>You needn't divulge
anything I can't guess.</i>

232
00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.369
As you wish.

233
00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:00.536
Your assistants
are behind the mirror...

234
00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:04.241
somewhere in robes obviously.

235
00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:07.842
Lights in the frame perhaps
to illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

236
00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:10.888
That would be one way to do it.

237
00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:13.651
I think I understand it all
except the ghost.

238
00:28:13.725 --> 00:28:15.784
That was very, very good.

239
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.761
Another viewing perhaps?

240
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.924
You must come to the Hofburg next time.
We'll make an evening of it.

241
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.628
That will be my pleasure.

242
00:28:24.702 --> 00:28:27.102
<i>So be it.</i>

243
00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.538
Sophie?

244
00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:39.378
<i>And we'll gather
our best minds next time.</i>

245
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.418
You'll really have a challenge then.

246
00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:44.353
Then I'll prepare something special.

247
00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.481
Perhaps I'll make you disappear.

248
00:28:58.903 --> 00:29:01.770
My God.
When he volunteered her...

249
00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:05.935
I heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles.

250
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.002
Every lady of means in Vienna will
want to get up there with you now.

251
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.014
- Mmm.
- What a show-off.

252
00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:13.744
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.

253
00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:17.345
- She didn't seem too happy about it either.
- She'd better get used to it.

254
00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.823
- How's that?
- Word is she'll marry him soon.

255
00:29:20.892 --> 00:29:24.419
- Really?
- Taking her chances if you ask me.

256
00:29:24.495 --> 00:29:27.157
- Why?
- He likes to give his lady friends...

257
00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:29.700
a good thrashing now and again.

258
00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.826
People say he pushed one of them
off a balcony...

259
00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.770
just to cover
the beating he'd given her.

260
00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:05.301
For Herr Eisenheim.

261
00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:48.909
Hello, Sophie.

262
00:30:53.682 --> 00:30:57.914
<i>When I was on the stage,
you knew me right away.</i>

263
00:30:57.986 --> 00:31:00.682
It took me a moment...

264
00:31:00.756 --> 00:31:03.224
but, yes, I knew.

265
00:31:03.292 --> 00:31:05.726
You could have said something.

266
00:31:05.794 --> 00:31:07.887
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.

267
00:31:07.963 --> 00:31:10.124
Yes, I would have.

268
00:31:10.199 --> 00:31:12.690
I would have come another night,
volunteered...

269
00:31:12.768 --> 00:31:14.759
walked right on stage
and said, "Hello. "

270
00:31:14.837 --> 00:31:17.203
<i>And then you'd really
have had to move quickly.</i>

271
00:31:17.272 --> 00:31:19.536
I suspect you would have.

272
00:31:22.044 --> 00:31:24.035
I don't understand why.

273
00:31:28.217 --> 00:31:32.244
Perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage.

274
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:35.722
It's just a game
I have to play with them.

275
00:31:37.459 --> 00:31:42.055
I'm followed everywhere. It's-
It's supposed to be for my protection.

276
00:31:44.233 --> 00:31:46.258
Yes.

277
00:31:46.335 --> 00:31:50.863
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

278
00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:53.533
<i>What for?</i>

279
00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:55.941
They say you'll be the princess.

280
00:31:56.011 --> 00:31:59.344
- It's not decided at all.
- Ah.

281
00:32:00.682 --> 00:32:03.378
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.

282
00:32:03.452 --> 00:32:07.013
We've known each other for years,
and of course, our families.

283
00:32:07.089 --> 00:32:09.614
He's very intelligent.

284
00:32:09.691 --> 00:32:13.183
<i>A little too intelligent
for his own good.</i>

285
00:32:16.932 --> 00:32:19.924
You're lucky, you know...

286
00:32:20.002 --> 00:32:22.800
to have broken free as you did.

287
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.604
I often wish that I had-

288
00:32:30.746 --> 00:32:32.680
Wished what?

289
00:32:36.018 --> 00:32:38.612
Wished that I would see you again.

290
00:32:43.392 --> 00:32:45.451
And now you have.

291
00:32:47.596 --> 00:32:51.191
Yes, now I have.

292
00:32:58.207 --> 00:33:01.005
I look forward to seeing you
again at the Hofburg.

293
00:33:01.076 --> 00:33:03.408
Until then.

294
00:33:27.336 --> 00:33:29.361
Here's the report
on Duchess von Teschen.

295
00:33:29.438 --> 00:33:31.804
Mmm. Anything interesting?

296
00:33:31.874 --> 00:33:33.865
See for yourself.

297
00:33:40.983 --> 00:33:43.543
The magician?

298
00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.553
<i>They drove around for half an hour.</i>

299
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:48.454
<i>Then he got out near the theater.</i>

300
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.527
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

301
00:34:11.914 --> 00:34:14.906
Join us for a drink?

302
00:34:20.522 --> 00:34:22.820
Please.

303
00:34:33.168 --> 00:34:35.762
You like something to eat,
something to drink, hmm?

304
00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:38.101
- No, thank you.
- Herr Eisenheim...

305
00:34:38.173 --> 00:34:41.904
I'm going to ask you a question...

306
00:34:41.977 --> 00:34:43.968
that may not seem friendly...

307
00:34:44.046 --> 00:34:47.607
but I assure you, in fact, is.

308
00:34:49.518 --> 00:34:53.682
What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?

309
00:34:53.755 --> 00:34:56.485
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

310
00:34:56.558 --> 00:34:59.026
Oh, but that is precisely my point.

311
00:34:59.094 --> 00:35:02.791
For, you see,
where others might judge...

312
00:35:02.864 --> 00:35:07.665
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...

313
00:35:07.736 --> 00:35:11.331
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

314
00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:15.805
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

315
00:35:15.877 --> 00:35:18.277
Acquaintances?

316
00:35:18.347 --> 00:35:20.645
Childhood friends.

317
00:35:20.716 --> 00:35:22.877
My father was a cabinetmaker.

318
00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:26.580
<i>He made the furniture
for her family's house.</i>

319
00:35:26.655 --> 00:35:29.988
I see, the cabinetmaker's son
friends with a-

320
00:35:30.058 --> 00:35:34.961
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...

321
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.522
well, we'd be having a very, uh,
different sort of conversation.

322
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:44.531
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

323
00:35:44.606 --> 00:35:47.541
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

324
00:35:47.609 --> 00:35:49.668
That's not what I hear.

325
00:35:49.745 --> 00:35:53.408
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.

326
00:35:53.482 --> 00:35:58.010
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.

327
00:35:58.086 --> 00:36:01.146
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

328
00:36:01.223 --> 00:36:05.683
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.

329
00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:09.527
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

330
00:36:09.598 --> 00:36:15.400
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

331
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:20.601
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

332
00:36:20.676 --> 00:36:24.737
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?

333
00:36:24.813 --> 00:36:28.579
<i>Hmm? Do you see my point?</i>

334
00:36:32.954 --> 00:36:36.185
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

335
00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.994
I've served on the edge of it...

336
00:36:40.062 --> 00:36:44.055
for... many, many years...

337
00:36:44.132 --> 00:36:46.225
and I can tell you with certainty...

338
00:36:46.301 --> 00:36:49.600
<i>there's no trick they haven't seen.</i>

339
00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:56.142
It's not worth it.

340
00:37:00.315 --> 00:37:02.977
<i>My guest tonight...</i>

341
00:37:03.051 --> 00:37:08.284
is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...

342
00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:11.883
<i>who has sold his soul
to the devil...</i>

343
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.396
<i>in return for unholy powers.</i>

344
00:37:15.464 --> 00:37:18.433
Or so at least some of our friends here
would have us believe.

345
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.934
<i>But fear not.</i>

346
00:37:21.002 --> 00:37:26.201
Everything can
and will be explained.

347
00:37:26.274 --> 00:37:30.802
<i>- All mysteries penetrated.
- Hear! Hear!</i>

348
00:37:30.879 --> 00:37:33.939
<i>Well said! Well said!</i>

349
00:37:59.574 --> 00:38:02.304
<i>- Is that the emperor?
- Ah, yes, your father.</i>

350
00:38:02.377 --> 00:38:05.676
I didn't think he was invited.

351
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:09.943
<i>Bravo.</i>

352
00:38:15.957 --> 00:38:19.358
A fair likeness of the old man.

353
00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:22.794
<i>Too modern a style for him, of course.</i>

354
00:38:22.864 --> 00:38:24.991
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

355
00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:28.331
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.

356
00:38:28.403 --> 00:38:31.804
I can see that clearly.

357
00:38:31.873 --> 00:38:33.807
So to achieve the color...

358
00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:37.709
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

359
00:38:37.779 --> 00:38:40.680
<i>Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?</i>

360
00:38:40.749 --> 00:38:44.014
- May I?
- If you feel you must.

361
00:38:45.687 --> 00:38:49.384
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

362
00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:52.517
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

363
00:38:52.594 --> 00:38:54.926
I do.

364
00:38:54.996 --> 00:38:57.658
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

365
00:38:57.732 --> 00:39:00.064
Which is the more noble pursuit?

366
00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:02.069
May we have the lights, please...

367
00:39:02.137 --> 00:39:04.435
so His Highness can better see?

368
00:39:04.506 --> 00:39:08.237
- See here, Leopold, let's have the show.
- Hear! Hear!

369
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.676
- Come on, Leopold.
- Get on with it.

370
00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:13.578
Very well. I propose a challenge.

371
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.583
<i>Why don't you astonish us...</i>

372
00:39:18.653 --> 00:39:20.985
if you can...

373
00:39:21.056 --> 00:39:25.459
without all the... gadgetry?

374
00:39:25.527 --> 00:39:28.087
As you wish.

375
00:39:29.965 --> 00:39:32.297
<i>Your sword is very beautiful.</i>

376
00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:34.096
Might I see it?

377
00:39:34.169 --> 00:39:36.160
Certainly.

378
00:39:38.807 --> 00:39:40.798
May I?

379
00:39:47.148 --> 00:39:49.776
Where does power flow from?

380
00:39:51.786 --> 00:39:55.483
Skill or destiny, or divine right?

381
00:39:57.659 --> 00:40:01.459
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

382
00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:06.662
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone...

383
00:40:10.272 --> 00:40:12.832
and there it stayed.

384
00:40:14.976 --> 00:40:19.572
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.

385
00:40:19.648 --> 00:40:22.412
Only Arthur succeeded...

386
00:40:22.484 --> 00:40:24.452
proving his right to rule.

387
00:40:24.519 --> 00:40:27.352
<i>Who can take this sword?</i>

388
00:40:27.422 --> 00:40:31.586
You, sir, can you take the sword?

389
00:40:52.614 --> 00:40:54.775
No surprise there.

390
00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:57.340
<i>Perhaps you, sir.</i>

391
00:40:59.287 --> 00:41:02.620
<i>Not so eager, cousin.</i>

392
00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:07.654
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>

393
00:41:07.729 --> 00:41:11.221
<i>- Do it! Do it!
- Come on!</i>

394
00:41:18.473 --> 00:41:21.909
You shall live a long life.

395
00:41:21.977 --> 00:41:24.878
Thank you for your indulgence.

396
00:41:37.625 --> 00:41:40.389
Come now. If you can't pull it out,
you'll never be emperor.

397
00:41:40.462 --> 00:41:43.863
<i>Your father will live to be a hundred.</i>

398
00:41:55.777 --> 00:41:58.541
The sword to its rightful owner!

399
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:12.553
That's enough light entertainment
for this evening.

400
00:42:12.627 --> 00:42:16.791
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.

401
00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:31.645
Shut him down.

402
00:42:31.713 --> 00:42:34.113
Well, he's very popular,
Your Highness.

403
00:42:34.182 --> 00:42:36.844
I'm sure you'll find a way.

404
00:42:43.224 --> 00:42:48.355
- What did you do to him?
- I gave him what he asked for.

405
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:50.898
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?

406
00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:55.868
<i>Duchess von Teschen,
you must come along, my dear.</i>

407
00:42:55.937 --> 00:42:58.997
We don't want to keep
the prince waiting.

408
00:42:59.074 --> 00:43:01.702
- Did you enjoy the show?
- It was wonderful, wasn't it?

409
00:43:01.776 --> 00:43:04.301
It was amusing.

410
00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:44.044
Who told you where to find me?

411
00:43:44.119 --> 00:43:48.647
Your manager. I told him if he wants
to stay in Vienna, you need my help.

412
00:43:48.723 --> 00:43:51.283
Ah, so I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?

413
00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:54.487
- Good. I shall relish it.
- Stop it!

414
00:43:56.231 --> 00:43:58.358
<i>I came here to try to help you.</i>

415
00:43:58.433 --> 00:44:02.130
Why? Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?

416
00:44:02.203 --> 00:44:04.637
<i>You were my friend.
I am your friend.</i>

417
00:44:04.706 --> 00:44:09.643
We knew each other very briefly
a long time ago. You don't know me at all.

418
00:44:09.711 --> 00:44:14.614
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking-

419
00:45:30.525 --> 00:45:32.993
And you kept it all this time.

420
00:45:34.696 --> 00:45:38.359
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...

421
00:45:38.433 --> 00:45:40.924
trying to imagine where you were.

422
00:45:42.471 --> 00:45:47.306
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you...

423
00:45:47.376 --> 00:45:51.107
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

424
00:45:58.587 --> 00:46:02.284
But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.

425
00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:14.057
Where did you go when you left?

426
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:18.871
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

427
00:46:20.142 --> 00:46:22.133
How exotic.

428
00:46:25.447 --> 00:46:28.416
I went to Russia...

429
00:46:28.483 --> 00:46:30.417
then Asia Minor...

430
00:46:30.485 --> 00:46:33.079
and then the Orient for many years.

431
00:46:33.155 --> 00:46:35.487
So long.

432
00:46:35.557 --> 00:46:38.048
I always meant to return.

433
00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:44.598
I just- I kept thinking I'd find it
around the next corner.

434
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.691
What?

435
00:46:49.304 --> 00:46:51.238
A real mystery.

436
00:46:54.075 --> 00:46:56.202
I saw remarkable things...

437
00:46:56.278 --> 00:46:59.611
but the only mystery
I never solved was...

438
00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:02.741
why my heart couldn't let go of you.

439
00:47:23.839 --> 00:47:26.433
He wants me to go to Budapest...

440
00:47:26.508 --> 00:47:28.942
with him next week
to announce our engagement.

441
00:47:31.146 --> 00:47:34.912
He wants the Hungarians behind him.

442
00:47:34.983 --> 00:47:37.247
They're going to crown him king.

443
00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:40.083
I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.

444
00:47:40.155 --> 00:47:42.385
He plans to overthrow his father.

445
00:47:43.658 --> 00:47:46.889
That could go very badly for him...

446
00:47:46.962 --> 00:47:48.896
and for you.

447
00:47:48.964 --> 00:47:50.932
<i>You shouldn't be involved.</i>

448
00:47:50.999 --> 00:47:54.594
I am part of his plan.

449
00:47:54.669 --> 00:47:57.433
He only gets Hungary by
aligning himself with my family.

450
00:47:57.506 --> 00:48:01.738
- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.

451
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.576
Call it off and come away with me.

452
00:48:05.647 --> 00:48:11.279
<i>Or don't say anything
and we'll just go.</i>

453
00:48:11.353 --> 00:48:14.686
As long as we're alive...

454
00:48:14.756 --> 00:48:16.690
he'll hunt us.

455
00:48:16.758 --> 00:48:18.919
And when he finds us, he'll kill us.

456
00:48:32.374 --> 00:48:34.308
Look at me.

457
00:48:36.645 --> 00:48:39.944
<i>Do you truly want to leave with me?</i>

458
00:48:43.919 --> 00:48:47.480
Yes, I do.

459
00:49:23.758 --> 00:49:27.660
There you are. As I predicted,
they've shut us down.

460
00:49:27.729 --> 00:49:31.790
<i>Are you happy now, hmm?
You made your point.</i>

461
00:49:31.866 --> 00:49:34.630
<i>It doesn't matter that we were
sold out for the whole run!</i>

462
00:49:34.703 --> 00:49:38.764
No, look. You got it off your chest.

463
00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.831
<i>- Do we have money?
- What?</i>

464
00:49:40.909 --> 00:49:43.810
- Do we have any money saved?
- Yes, we have some.

465
00:49:43.878 --> 00:49:46.210
But we could have had
much, much more.

466
00:49:46.281 --> 00:49:49.648
Mmm, it will have to do.

467
00:49:51.353 --> 00:49:53.514
And the second account, all of it.

468
00:49:53.588 --> 00:49:56.580
<i>Of course, Herr Eisenheim.</i>

469
00:50:00.762 --> 00:50:02.889
Thank you.

470
00:50:56.484 --> 00:50:59.385
And you have no doubt
it was Duchess von Teschen?

471
00:50:59.454 --> 00:51:02.855
I'd stake my life on it.

472
00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:05.290
What was in this suitcase?

473
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.351
I don't know.

474
00:51:17.605 --> 00:51:20.073
He's by the first car.

475
00:51:44.766 --> 00:51:47.530
<i>The map will show you where to meet.</i>

476
00:51:47.602 --> 00:51:51.800
<i>When it's done, you'll travel ahead
with her and I shall follow.</i>

477
00:51:51.873 --> 00:51:54.535
<i>And she understands
everything this entails?</i>

478
00:51:54.609 --> 00:51:59.137
<i>Completely. There's not a lot of time.</i>

479
00:52:29.711 --> 00:52:32.976
As you know, we sometimes follow...

480
00:52:33.047 --> 00:52:36.210
Duchess von Teschen
for her protection.

481
00:52:37.752 --> 00:52:40.585
Yesterday she was seen
in the company of another man.

482
00:52:40.655 --> 00:52:42.316
What man?

483
00:52:43.558 --> 00:52:46.049
Eisenheim the Illusionist.

484
00:52:46.127 --> 00:52:49.028
What were they doing?

485
00:52:49.097 --> 00:52:53.534
<i>- Well, they were meeting and, uh-
- Touching? Kissing?</i>

486
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:55.262
Fornicating?

487
00:52:55.336 --> 00:52:58.863
Not that we observed, no.

488
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.273
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.

489
00:53:03.778 --> 00:53:05.939
<i>It's possible they may be leaving.</i>

490
00:53:06.014 --> 00:53:08.676
I'm not certain of anything yet,
Your Highness.

491
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:10.911
Thank you, Inspector.

492
00:53:10.985 --> 00:53:14.182
<i>We can, of course, acquire more information-</i>

493
00:53:45.386 --> 00:53:48.355
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.

494
00:53:48.423 --> 00:53:50.891
He's expected shortly.

495
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.288
What a surprise.

496
00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.454
<i>I thought you didn't like it here.</i>

497
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.930
I suppose you think
you're very clever...

498
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:41.030
and very democratic
in your friendships.

499
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:43.669
<i>- Aren't you?
- What are you talking about?</i>

500
00:54:43.745 --> 00:54:46.805
Your magician friend.

501
00:54:46.881 --> 00:54:49.179
I know you've been with him.

502
00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:54.819
It's true. We've been
friends since childhood.

503
00:54:54.889 --> 00:54:57.517
You sleep with all
your childhood friends?

504
00:54:57.592 --> 00:54:59.787
I will not be spoken to this way.

505
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:03.353
- You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you!
- You're drunk.

506
00:55:03.431 --> 00:55:06.798
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?

507
00:55:06.868 --> 00:55:10.201
<i>You know, my mother was 16 years old
when she married my father.</i>

508
00:55:10.271 --> 00:55:14.002
And you? Can you even bear children?
Are you any use at all?

509
00:55:14.075 --> 00:55:17.511
- Are you trying to embarrass me?
- It has nothing to do with you.

510
00:55:17.578 --> 00:55:21.105
It has everything to do with me!

511
00:55:21.182 --> 00:55:24.481
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!

512
00:55:26.321 --> 00:55:28.915
You don't understand.

513
00:55:30.058 --> 00:55:32.424
I'm not going to share
your bed at all.

514
00:55:34.696 --> 00:55:38.564
I'm not going to Budapest with you.

515
00:55:38.633 --> 00:55:41.761
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.

516
00:55:41.836 --> 00:55:44.031
And I will not marry you.

517
00:55:47.608 --> 00:55:51.203
<i>I assume you haven't been so stupid
as to tell him anything.</i>

518
00:55:51.279 --> 00:55:55.375
<i>'Cause if you disrupt my plans, I will have
no further use for you. Do you understand?</i>

519
00:56:02.457 --> 00:56:06.086
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.

520
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.256
I recommend that you are here early,
packed and ready to go.

521
00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:13.027
<i>Do nothing more to embarrass me.</i>

522
00:56:14.268 --> 00:56:16.202
Good-bye.

523
00:56:19.507 --> 00:56:23.136
What do you mean, "Good-bye"?
Come back here.

524
00:56:27.648 --> 00:56:29.843
Come back here!

525
00:56:43.164 --> 00:56:46.827
<i>Don't disobey me again.
Whore!</i>

526
00:56:54.242 --> 00:56:56.437
<i>Out of my way.</i>

527
00:56:56.511 --> 00:57:00.242
<i>Please, don't.</i>

528
00:57:26.674 --> 00:57:30.007
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.

529
00:58:36.276 --> 00:58:40.804
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

530
00:58:40.881 --> 00:58:43.349
<i>Duchess von Teschen!</i>

531
00:58:52.325 --> 00:58:55.783
<i>Maybe look on that side!</i>

532
00:58:57.964 --> 00:59:00.797
<i>Over here!</i>

533
00:59:52.852 --> 00:59:56.151
Whoa. Whoa.

534
01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:05.393
I thought you saw her
get on the train with him.

535
01:00:05.465 --> 01:00:09.595
No, sir. We were waiting in Vienna
for them, but they left from Baden.

536
01:00:09.669 --> 01:00:12.001
<i>We assumed she was with him.</i>

537
01:00:12.072 --> 01:00:14.097
<i>Should I wire
the crown prince in Budapest?</i>

538
01:00:14.174 --> 01:00:16.642
<i>It's been done.</i>

539
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:19.770
- Who are you?
- I'm the family's doctor.

540
01:00:19.846 --> 01:00:21.973
Are you the chief inspector?

541
01:00:22.048 --> 01:00:25.882
Yes, I am. You understand
this is a police matter now?

542
01:00:25.952 --> 01:00:29.547
- Of course I understand.
- Good, good.

543
01:00:29.623 --> 01:00:32.888
<i>- You have determined the cause of death?
- She bled to death.</i>

544
01:00:32.959 --> 01:00:35.894
There's a wound on her throat...

545
01:00:35.962 --> 01:00:38.760
just above the left collarbone.

546
01:00:38.832 --> 01:00:41.232
Perhaps from a knife or a sword.

547
01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:43.565
May I take a look?

548
01:01:06.292 --> 01:01:08.760
Inspector, I-I will
not stand for it.

549
01:01:08.828 --> 01:01:11.456
The crown prince
will not stand for it.

550
01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:14.796
This is not some circus sideshow.

551
01:01:16.102 --> 01:01:18.832
My apologies, of course.

552
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:25.703
Thank you, Doctor.

553
01:01:29.382 --> 01:01:33.045
Probably robbed.
Gypsies, maybe.

554
01:01:33.119 --> 01:01:35.610
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.

555
01:01:35.689 --> 01:01:40.251
Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.

556
01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:43.625
<i>- Yes, what is that?
- In the folds of her dress...</i>

557
01:01:43.697 --> 01:01:47.428
I found this small gemstone.

558
01:02:04.350 --> 01:02:07.376
Seen last Thursday at 7:30 p. m.,
riding without an escort...

559
01:02:07.454 --> 01:02:09.388
toward the Imperial Hunting Lodge.

560
01:02:09.456 --> 01:02:13.051
Groomsman said
she arrived about 8:30.

561
01:02:13.126 --> 01:02:15.060
What was she doing riding alone?

562
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:21.022
He did this.
You know he did.

563
01:02:21.101 --> 01:02:23.092
- I know who did what?
- The crown prince!

564
01:02:23.169 --> 01:02:25.399
He killed her. He's done it
before, and you know it.

565
01:02:25.472 --> 01:02:28.305
No, I don't know that. In fact,
I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

566
01:02:28.374 --> 01:02:31.832
- He killed her before he left!
- I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.

567
01:02:34.447 --> 01:02:37.280
- She was leaving him.
- For who? You?

568
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.648
- Yes!
- Don't be absurd, Herr Eisenheim.

569
01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:42.916
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.

570
01:02:42.989 --> 01:02:45.981
- She knew his secret.
- What secret?

571
01:02:46.059 --> 01:02:48.027
- Ask your inspector. He knows-
- Stop this right now!

572
01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:52.360
Are you completely corrupt?

573
01:02:52.432 --> 01:02:56.528
No, not completely. No.

574
01:02:56.603 --> 01:03:01.631
Which is why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone, especially His Imperial Highness.

575
01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:03.699
Or you will end up in jail yourself.

576
01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.826
- Where's the guard who let her out of the gate?
- Gone with the crown prince.

577
01:03:29.903 --> 01:03:31.996
- Did any of the servants see her leave?
- All asleep.

578
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:34.801
Ah-ha.
What about him?

579
01:03:34.874 --> 01:03:37.809
He, uh, he put her horse
in the first stall when she arrived.

580
01:03:37.877 --> 01:03:39.868
Ah.

581
01:03:43.449 --> 01:03:45.713
Was it this one?

582
01:03:55.061 --> 01:03:58.622
We don't have jurisdiction
on Imperial property.

583
01:03:58.698 --> 01:04:00.689
Thank you.
I know.

584
01:04:02.535 --> 01:04:05.060
So what are you doing?

585
01:04:07.106 --> 01:04:09.597
Investigating.

586
01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:12.042
Listening to that magician, are you?

587
01:04:15.114 --> 01:04:17.639
<i>For all we know, he did it.</i>

588
01:04:17.717 --> 01:04:20.049
No, I think not.

589
01:04:20.119 --> 01:04:22.519
<i>The crown prince is back.</i>

590
01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:33.363
<i>Chief Inspector.</i>

591
01:04:33.433 --> 01:04:37.369
<i>We should go. Now.</i>

592
01:04:41.241 --> 01:04:43.175
What have you found out?

593
01:04:43.243 --> 01:04:45.438
- She was last seen riding here, alone.
- Yes.

594
01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:49.003
And based on your information,
I then threw her out.

595
01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:52.813
- Did she commit suicide?
- No. It was surely murder.

596
01:04:52.886 --> 01:04:55.946
- Do you have a suspect?
- We will soon, Your Highness.

597
01:05:03.863 --> 01:05:07.924
<i>Later that week, we arrested
a man and charged him with murder...</i>

598
01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:12.097
<i>but I knew that
that wouldn't satisfy Eisenheim.</i>

599
01:05:17.277 --> 01:05:20.542
<i>I had my men continue to watch him.</i>

600
01:05:35.762 --> 01:05:39.596
<i>He finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater.</i>

601
01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.600
It's perfect.

602
01:05:47.941 --> 01:05:49.875
<i>He fired his manager...</i>

603
01:05:49.943 --> 01:05:53.743
<i>and began preparing
for a new kind of show.</i>

604
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:59.261
<i>Who is he?</i>

605
01:08:01.107 --> 01:08:03.098
My name is Frankel.

606
01:08:05.411 --> 01:08:09.347
- Where did you come from?
- I come from Brunn.

607
01:08:09.415 --> 01:08:11.508
My father is a lens grinder there.

608
01:08:11.584 --> 01:08:14.519
How have you come
to be here tonight?

609
01:08:18.925 --> 01:08:22.088
<i>- I don't know.
- Are you alive?</i>

610
01:08:25.565 --> 01:08:27.829
<i>What can you tell us
about the other side?</i>

611
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.868
<i>- What's it like?
- Yes, tell us.</i>

612
01:08:29.936 --> 01:08:33.269
<i>You must know things. Secret things.</i>

613
01:08:33.339 --> 01:08:35.773
<i>Say something spiritual.</i>

614
01:08:57.096 --> 01:09:00.395
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.

615
01:09:00.466 --> 01:09:02.991
<i>Eisenheim! Come out and talk to us!</i>

616
01:09:08.741 --> 01:09:12.177
<i>Eisenheim's audience
had always been enthusiastic...</i>

617
01:09:12.245 --> 01:09:17.080
<i>but now he was attracting a more...
impassioned following.</i>

618
01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:48.346
<i>Madame. Please?</i>

619
01:09:57.190 --> 01:10:01.824
<i>With these spirits,
these manifestations...</i>

620
01:10:01.927 --> 01:10:04.828
Eisenheim has given us hard proof...

621
01:10:04.897 --> 01:10:07.365
of the soul's immortality.

622
01:10:07.433 --> 01:10:10.402
The spirit has been reaffirmed...

623
01:10:10.469 --> 01:10:13.734
<i>in the face of modern,
scientific materialism.</i>

624
01:10:13.806 --> 01:10:17.139
<i>The work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity...</i>

625
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:19.734
to a new, moral earnestness.

626
01:10:19.812 --> 01:10:23.908
"It is a revolutionary movement,
and we will turn the empire...

627
01:10:23.983 --> 01:10:26.645
into a spiritual republic. "

628
01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:30.815
Do you think Eisenheim's behind all this?

629
01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:42.092
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?

630
01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:45.898
He is proving to be more
than a magician, Your Highness.

631
01:10:45.971 --> 01:10:49.566
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.

632
01:10:49.642 --> 01:10:53.738
He pretends to have
supernatural powers-

633
01:10:55.247 --> 01:10:57.647
Put him on trial for fraud.

634
01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:01.749
- First, we have to show it is fraud.
- Then do it.

635
01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:04.118
Find out how the trick is done,
and then arrest him.

636
01:11:13.432 --> 01:11:15.923
This is just a rough demonstration,
Inspector.

637
01:11:16.001 --> 01:11:17.992
But you can see how it could work.

638
01:11:25.844 --> 01:11:28.938
Yes, I see.
Not bad, not bad.

639
01:11:32.952 --> 01:11:35.352
We need a spy in Eisenheim's troupe.

640
01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.015
- Those Orientals, they won't give us anything.
- Mm.

641
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:41.116
- I already tried.
- Yeah. Then try something else.

642
01:13:00.072 --> 01:13:02.006
What has happened here?

643
01:13:02.074 --> 01:13:04.372
One of those ghosts from
the theater down the street.

644
01:13:04.443 --> 01:13:06.604
- Yes. Up there.
- Where?

645
01:13:06.679 --> 01:13:09.705
- There.
- Right there. And it's a boy.

646
01:13:09.782 --> 01:13:12.444
- Yes. Look, look.
- Sick!

647
01:13:15.654 --> 01:13:18.145
- Where is this thing?
- Right there.

648
01:13:18.223 --> 01:13:20.316
- Over there.
- Uh-huh. Did you see it?

649
01:13:20.392 --> 01:13:22.383
Mm!

650
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:29.467
<i>God. An apparition. I saw it. I swear.</i>

651
01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:33.335
<i>- Yes!
- Right over there.</i>

652
01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:26.414
<i>Where are you taking him?</i>

653
01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:35.223
<i>I want to know how it's done.</i>

654
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.962
First the orange tree, now this.

655
01:14:38.036 --> 01:14:40.630
Do I have to share all my professional
secrets with the police?

656
01:14:40.706 --> 01:14:43.504
Well, in this case, yes,
or I'll be forced to arrest you.

657
01:14:43.575 --> 01:14:45.736
- On what charge?
- Oh, well, we'll start with fraud.

658
01:14:47.813 --> 01:14:49.838
- Excuse me, Chief Inspector-
- What?

659
01:14:49.915 --> 01:14:52.577
I think you should look
outside the window.

660
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:08.393
- Who are they?
- They are here for him.

661
01:15:09.434 --> 01:15:11.766
<i>Oh!</i>

662
01:15:11.837 --> 01:15:15.000
My goodness, you have
a devoted following.

663
01:15:15.073 --> 01:15:18.668
- What is it they expect of you?
- I have no idea.

664
01:15:18.744 --> 01:15:21.144
What do your spies tell you?

665
01:15:21.213 --> 01:15:24.341
That you plan to subvert
the monarchy, perhaps.

666
01:15:24.416 --> 01:15:28.546
Why? Just because
the crown prince is a murderer?

667
01:15:30.055 --> 01:15:32.990
He's not a murderer.
We have the real murderer in prison.

668
01:15:33.058 --> 01:15:35.356
- He pleaded guilty.
- You've got the wrong man.

669
01:15:35.427 --> 01:15:38.760
- You don't know that.
- No, but you do.

670
01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:42.759
Hmm.

671
01:15:45.137 --> 01:15:48.004
Herr Eisenheim, you will
also go to prison...

672
01:15:48.073 --> 01:15:51.474
if you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.

673
01:15:51.543 --> 01:15:55.377
<i>- Let him go!
- Or we will!</i>

674
01:15:55.447 --> 01:15:59.440
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.

675
01:15:59.518 --> 01:16:02.419
<i>Eisenheim! Eisenheim! Eisenheim!</i>

676
01:16:02.487 --> 01:16:06.082
<i>Well?</i>

677
01:16:08.026 --> 01:16:10.460
<i>What are you doing?
Stop!</i>

678
01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:12.724
<i>- Stop!
- Eisenheim!</i>

679
01:16:12.798 --> 01:16:15.096
<i>There he is!</i>

680
01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:17.397
<i>Listen to me, please!</i>

681
01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:21.132
<i>You must listen to me, please!</i>

682
01:16:23.508 --> 01:16:28.070
Thank you all for coming. I have been
speaking with the chief inspector.

683
01:16:28.146 --> 01:16:32.810
<i>And I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.</i>

684
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.945
I want you all to know...

685
01:16:37.022 --> 01:16:41.083
that everything that you have seen
in my theater is an illusion.

686
01:16:41.159 --> 01:16:44.094
<i>It's a trick.</i>

687
01:16:44.162 --> 01:16:46.392
<i>It's not real.</i>

688
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:53.301
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.

689
01:16:53.372 --> 01:16:56.341
I can't receive messages
from the other side.

690
01:16:57.776 --> 01:17:00.609
I apologize if I've given
you any false hope.

691
01:17:00.679 --> 01:17:06.618
My intention has only been
to entertain, nothing more.

692
01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:12.519
<i>Now I appreciate your support.</i>

693
01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.821
<i>But you must go home.</i>

694
01:17:14.893 --> 01:17:17.828
Please, you must go.

695
01:17:29.875 --> 01:17:33.675
There, now. I've explained it,
so it can't be fraud.

696
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.772
May I go?

697
01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:01.205
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?

698
01:18:02.874 --> 01:18:04.808
<i>No, Your Highness.</i>

699
01:18:04.876 --> 01:18:07.640
Then why are you failing me?

700
01:18:11.516 --> 01:18:13.814
I thought I could trust you.

701
01:18:15.487 --> 01:18:19.924
I thought you were a man I could bring
with me when I took the throne.

702
01:18:22.461 --> 01:18:25.624
- Am I wrong about you?
- No. You're not wrong, Your Highness, no.

703
01:18:25.697 --> 01:18:30.862
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!

704
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:40.910
Instead, I'm surrounded by fools.

705
01:18:40.979 --> 01:18:44.881
<i>In the end, I must
do everything myself.</i>

706
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:47.976
- I can see this case will be no different.
- Mm.

707
01:19:07.205 --> 01:19:11.642
- How do I look?
- Ordinary, Your Highness.

708
01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:13.644
Very ordinary.

709
01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:20.182
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

710
01:19:40.672 --> 01:19:45.405
- They don't recognize you.
- Good.

711
01:19:45.477 --> 01:19:49.538
And keep your distance. I don't want
to be seen with a policeman.

712
01:21:09.027 --> 01:21:11.928
<i>Who are you?</i>

713
01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:14.557
<i>Are you Duchess von Teschen?</i>

714
01:21:14.633 --> 01:21:16.567
Yes.

715
01:21:16.635 --> 01:21:18.694
<i>What's happened to you?</i>

716
01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:21.534
<i>She was murdered.
Were you murdered?</i>

717
01:21:24.376 --> 01:21:27.038
<i>By who?</i>

718
01:21:27.112 --> 01:21:29.046
<i>Did they arrest the right man?</i>

719
01:21:29.114 --> 01:21:32.242
<i>Tell us, please. Who murdered you?</i>

720
01:21:32.317 --> 01:21:35.252
<i>- Tell us.
- Someone. Here.</i>

721
01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.050
<i>Tell us, and point him out.</i>

722
01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:40.114
<i>Was it the crown prince?</i>

723
01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:42.422
<i>He's killed a woman before!</i>

724
01:21:42.494 --> 01:21:44.655
<i>Hey! The crown prince isn't even here.</i>

725
01:21:44.729 --> 01:21:48.096
<i>The crown prince
killed her! Something must be done!</i>

726
01:22:14.926 --> 01:22:17.087
Chief Inspector, are you sure
you have the right man?

727
01:22:17.162 --> 01:22:20.063
- Quite sure. Excuse me.
- Did you investigate the crown prince?

728
01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:22.065
He cannot continue if this is true.

729
01:22:22.133 --> 01:22:24.067
- He must be brought to justice.
- It's not true.

730
01:22:24.135 --> 01:22:26.831
The magic trick is not evidence.
What is your name?

731
01:22:26.905 --> 01:22:30.466
- I don't see how that matters.
- I advise you to watch what you say, sir.

732
01:22:36.915 --> 01:22:40.112
That actress didn't even
look like Sophie.

733
01:22:40.185 --> 01:22:42.346
But the audience is
stupid and he knows it.

734
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:46.618
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.

735
01:22:46.691 --> 01:22:48.625
His actress said nothing
inflammatory.

736
01:22:48.693 --> 01:22:50.957
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.

737
01:22:51.029 --> 01:22:53.429
All plants paid for
by him, of course.

738
01:22:55.233 --> 01:22:57.360
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people?

739
01:22:57.435 --> 01:22:59.665
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.

740
01:22:59.738 --> 01:23:02.798
<i>At the next performance,
I want them all arrested.</i>

741
01:23:02.874 --> 01:23:06.275
Every one of them.
Eisenheim, the whole troupe.

742
01:23:06.344 --> 01:23:09.575
I want to have an example
made of him...

743
01:23:09.648 --> 01:23:12.310
in front of all his followers.

744
01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:18.119
That was very foolish last night.

745
01:23:22.193 --> 01:23:24.753
You can't destroy him, you know.

746
01:23:24.829 --> 01:23:27.992
<i>- You can't bring down the monarchy.
- Oh, I know I can't.</i>

747
01:23:28.066 --> 01:23:30.330
Then don't raise her again.

748
01:23:30.402 --> 01:23:32.836
Don't provoke those questions.

749
01:23:37.509 --> 01:23:40.171
Eisenheim, I don't
want to arrest you.

750
01:23:43.048 --> 01:23:45.107
I'm a cynical man, God knows...

751
01:23:45.183 --> 01:23:48.175
but if your manifestations
are somehow real...

752
01:23:48.253 --> 01:23:51.279
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're a very special person.

753
01:23:51.356 --> 01:23:54.291
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.

754
01:23:54.359 --> 01:23:56.884
Either way, you have a gift.

755
01:23:56.961 --> 01:24:00.328
So don't make me put you in jail!

756
01:24:00.398 --> 01:24:02.628
Promise me you won't do it again.

757
01:24:02.701 --> 01:24:05.966
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.

758
01:24:07.072 --> 01:24:09.973
What do you want?

759
01:24:10.041 --> 01:24:14.410
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?

760
01:24:16.381 --> 01:24:18.372
Just to be with her.

761
01:24:21.152 --> 01:24:23.086
To be with her.

762
01:24:32.897 --> 01:24:34.831
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:24:34.899 --> 01:24:38.096
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.

764
01:24:38.169 --> 01:24:40.729
- I want guards at every door and window!
- Sir.

765
01:24:48.413 --> 01:24:51.083
<i>I want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late.</i>

766
01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:54.117
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.

767
01:24:54.186 --> 01:24:57.451
- Well, I don't know.
- I'll make it worth your while, Josef.

768
01:24:57.522 --> 01:25:00.821
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.

769
01:25:00.892 --> 01:25:02.883
No. No, of course.

770
01:25:07.332 --> 01:25:10.859
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.

771
01:25:10.936 --> 01:25:13.370
And my assets.

772
01:25:13.438 --> 01:25:16.066
- Everything.
- Everything?

773
01:25:16.141 --> 01:25:19.304
Yes. Including this theater...

774
01:25:19.377 --> 01:25:21.311
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance...

775
01:25:21.379 --> 01:25:24.314
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.

776
01:25:27.819 --> 01:25:32.188
- What do you say?
- All right.

777
01:25:32.257 --> 01:25:35.283
- I'll do it.
- Good. Good.

778
01:25:36.461 --> 01:25:39.589
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

779
01:25:39.664 --> 01:25:42.497
No. Tonight, just enjoy the show.

780
01:26:04.956 --> 01:26:08.255
Excuse me, Chief Inspector.
I'm Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager.

781
01:26:08.326 --> 01:26:10.692
Yes, I remember.

782
01:26:10.762 --> 01:26:13.629
- What's going on? Why all the police?
- Precautions, Herr Fischer.

783
01:26:13.698 --> 01:26:16.394
- Precautions.
- Are you planning to arrest Eisenheim?

784
01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:19.403
Oh, that's entirely up to him.

785
01:26:58.109 --> 01:27:01.078
<i>There! There!</i>

786
01:27:03.215 --> 01:27:05.206
<i>It's Duchess von Teschen!</i>

787
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:21.065
Why were you murdered?

788
01:27:21.132 --> 01:27:23.657
<i>- I was leaving him.
- Leaving who?</i>

789
01:27:23.735 --> 01:27:26.602
<i>- The crown prince?
- Of course it was.</i>

790
01:27:26.671 --> 01:27:29.469
<i>- We won't stand for it!
- I tried to get away.</i>

791
01:27:34.312 --> 01:27:36.337
I was wearing my locket when I died.

792
01:27:36.414 --> 01:27:39.542
<i>But now it's gone.
It's lost.</i>

793
01:27:39.618 --> 01:27:42.451
<i>- Tell us, please. Who murdered you?
- Was it the crown prince?</i>

794
01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:44.988
We must do something!

795
01:27:45.056 --> 01:27:47.524
<i>- Come along.
- We must help her!</i>

796
01:27:53.064 --> 01:27:55.055
<i>To the front!</i>

797
01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:58.665
<i>Step out!</i>

798
01:28:01.806 --> 01:28:04.639
<i>In the name of
His Imperial Majesty...</i>

799
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:09.976
and the City of Vienna,
I hereby arrest Eduard Abramovicz-

800
01:28:10.048 --> 01:28:12.949
also known as
Eisenheim the Illusionist-

801
01:28:13.018 --> 01:28:16.385
<i>on charges of
disturbing public order...</i>

802
01:28:16.454 --> 01:28:19.719
charlatanism and
threats against the empire!

803
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:22.624
<i>- No!
- Get back, get back!</i>

804
01:28:26.298 --> 01:28:29.665
<i>Stop it! Stop it, all of you!</i>

805
01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:27.515
- He disappeared.
- Where is he?

806
01:29:30.995 --> 01:29:33.225
Find him!

807
01:29:43.308 --> 01:29:45.833
- Where is he?
- He was right there.

808
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:48.105
- How was his trick done?
- No trick.

809
01:29:48.179 --> 01:29:50.647
- How is it done?
- I don't know. Nobody know.

810
01:29:58.423 --> 01:30:00.789
<i>Damn it!</i>

811
01:33:47.018 --> 01:33:50.715
<i>I had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters.</i>

812
01:33:53.324 --> 01:33:56.521
<i>My men will examine it and see
if it matches the gemstone...</i>

813
01:33:56.594 --> 01:33:59.563
<i>found on Duchess von Teschen's body-
I have no doubt that it will.</i>

814
01:34:03.735 --> 01:34:07.227
And after that, I came in here...

815
01:34:07.305 --> 01:34:10.502
and you asked me why I was late.

816
01:34:11.576 --> 01:34:13.544
You've stolen Imperial property.

817
01:34:13.611 --> 01:34:15.841
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

818
01:34:15.913 --> 01:34:18.313
Even if that were true, you have
no jurisdiction here.

819
01:34:18.383 --> 01:34:22.820
<i>That's right. You may do as you wish here,
without consequence.</i>

820
01:34:24.022 --> 01:34:27.753
Nobody can punish you.

821
01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:29.918
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

822
01:34:29.994 --> 01:34:32.861
The emperor.

823
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:35.899
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?

824
01:34:39.037 --> 01:34:42.370
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

825
01:34:43.675 --> 01:34:46.473
Hmm.

826
01:34:46.544 --> 01:34:48.671
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...

827
01:34:48.746 --> 01:34:52.113
<i>telling them... everything.</i>

828
01:34:52.183 --> 01:34:55.448
<i>Including your plan
to overthrow the emperor.</i>

829
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:58.717
I know they'll listen to that.

830
01:34:58.790 --> 01:35:01.384
<i>You'll not take the throne-
not with my help.</i>

831
01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:05.953
You no longer want to be chief of police?
Mayor of Vienna?

832
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:09.659
<i>You don't want to be
a baron, an aristocrat?</i>

833
01:35:10.968 --> 01:35:13.732
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

834
01:35:19.177 --> 01:35:21.111
You fool.
He's tricking you.

835
01:35:21.179 --> 01:35:24.671
He's manipulating you. He had the sword
at a command performance.

836
01:35:24.749 --> 01:35:27.240
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.

837
01:35:27.318 --> 01:35:29.252
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.

838
01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:33.984
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

839
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:38.725
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

840
01:35:51.809 --> 01:35:54.107
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

841
01:35:54.178 --> 01:35:58.012
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

842
01:35:58.082 --> 01:36:01.574
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.

843
01:36:01.652 --> 01:36:03.586
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

844
01:36:03.654 --> 01:36:07.317
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

845
01:36:23.441 --> 01:36:28.936
<i>Ah. Some officers
of the general staff, I'd guess.</i>

846
01:36:29.013 --> 01:36:31.004
They must have received my letter.

847
01:36:40.291 --> 01:36:44.057
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

848
01:36:44.128 --> 01:36:48.861
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.

849
01:36:57.041 --> 01:37:00.943
- Gentlemen-
- The situation is so obvious.

850
01:37:01.012 --> 01:37:03.981
Everyone's completely incompetent.

851
01:37:04.048 --> 01:37:06.482
My father runs the empire
into the ground...

852
01:37:06.551 --> 01:37:08.610
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.

853
01:37:08.686 --> 01:37:11.018
I propose to clean up
the mess, and you betray me!

854
01:37:11.088 --> 01:37:13.716
You're all becoming irrelevant.
You will be replaced.

855
01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:18.125
The country will be run by mongrels!

856
01:37:18.196 --> 01:37:22.155
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!

857
01:37:22.233 --> 01:37:26.192
Nothing!
I've done everything I can.

858
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:29.239
Too much!

859
01:37:31.442 --> 01:37:33.433
<i>Far too much.</i>

860
01:37:33.511 --> 01:37:36.742
<i>Your Highness!
Are you in there?</i>

861
01:37:36.814 --> 01:37:39.374
<i>Your Highness, open the door.</i>

862
01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:41.441
<i>Please. Open the door.</i>

863
01:37:41.519 --> 01:37:44.386
<i>By your father's authority...</i>

864
01:37:44.455 --> 01:37:47.447
<i>I insist you open the door!</i>

865
01:37:47.525 --> 01:37:49.652
<i>You must open the door!</i>

866
01:37:49.727 --> 01:37:52.389
You're all fools.

867
01:37:52.463 --> 01:37:55.762
<i>- Please, Your Highness!
- I can't stand it.</i>

868
01:37:55.833 --> 01:37:59.735
<i>I won't stand it.</i>

869
01:37:59.804 --> 01:38:02.295
<i>Break down the door. Break it down!</i>

870
01:38:07.178 --> 01:38:10.978
- What happened?
- The crown prince just shot himself.

871
01:38:56.928 --> 01:38:59.294
<i>Are you Chief Inspector Uhl?</i>

872
01:38:59.363 --> 01:39:01.763
I used to be.

873
01:39:26.357 --> 01:39:29.724
You!
Who gave you this?

874
01:39:31.963 --> 01:39:34.693
<i>- Who gave you this?
- Herr Eisenheim!</i>

875
01:39:35.766 --> 01:39:37.757
When?

876
01:39:59.623 --> 01:40:01.614
<i>Look out!</i>

877
01:41:05.289 --> 01:41:07.223
<i>All aboard!</i>

878
01:41:07.291 --> 01:41:09.816
Tickets and papers.

879
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:15.323
<i>All aboard!</i>

880
01:41:43.594 --> 01:41:45.528
<i>When it's done...</i>

881
01:41:45.596 --> 01:41:47.962
you'll travel ahead
with her, and I will follow.

882
01:41:48.031 --> 01:41:51.432
<i>- And she understands everything this entails?
- Completely.</i>

883
01:41:51.502 --> 01:41:54.027
<i>Do you think that
Eisenheim's behind all this?</i>

884
01:41:57.574 --> 01:42:01.476
<i>So, what does it mean, to die?</i>

885
01:42:03.914 --> 01:42:07.873
<i>- What do you want?
- To be with her.</i>

886
01:42:07.951 --> 01:42:10.977
<i>To be with her.</i>

887
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:18.684
<i>Chief Inspector,
there's one thing you should know.</i>

888
01:42:21.899 --> 01:42:24.629
<i>Your sword
is very beautiful. Might I see it?</i>

889
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:27.067
<i>- You're drunk.
- You were drunk.</i>

890
01:42:41.552 --> 01:42:43.884
<i>He's a charlatan. He's a faker.</i>

891
01:42:43.954 --> 01:42:46.514
<i>He's planted everything.</i>

892
01:42:57.568 --> 01:43:00.162
<i>Everything
you have seen is an illusion.</i>

893
01:43:00.237 --> 01:43:02.569
<i>It's a trick.</i>
