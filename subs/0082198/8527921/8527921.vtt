1
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:58.934
<i>Between the time
when the oceans drank Atlantis</i>

2
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:02.771
<i>and the rise of the sons of Aryas,</i>

3
00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:06.525
<i>there was an age undreamed of.</i>

4
00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:09.528
<i>And unto this, Conan,</i>

5
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:16.201
<i>destined to bear the jeweled crown
of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow.</i>

6
00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:21.498
<i>It is I, his chronicler, who alone
can tell thee of his saga.</i>

7
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:27.087
<i>Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.</i>

8
00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.378
Fire and wind
come from the sky,

9
00:04:13.575 --> 00:04:16.131
from the gods of the sky.

10
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:20.719
But Crom is your god.
Crom, and he lives in the earth.

11
00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:25.515
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.

12
00:04:26.307 --> 00:04:30.729
And in the darkness of chaos,
they fooled Crom,

13
00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.898
and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

14
00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:37.902
Crom was angered,
and the earth shook.

15
00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:40.280
And fire and wind
struck down these giants,

16
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.788
and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

17
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:48.329
But in their rage,
the gods forgot the secret of steel,

18
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.712
and left it on the battlefield.

19
00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.175
And we who found it...

20
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.546
...are just men.

21
00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.592
Not gods, not giants.

22
00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:03.386
Just men.

23
00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:08.808
And the secret of steel has always
carried with it a mystery.

24
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:13.410
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

25
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.824
For no one, no one in this world,
can you trust.

26
00:05:19.003 --> 00:05:22.155
Not men, not women, not beasts.

27
00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:28.089
This you can trust.

28
00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.264
Hyah!

29
00:08:26.652 --> 00:08:28.355
Kill that one!

30
00:08:51.794 --> 00:08:53.966
Kill them!
Crush them!

31
00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:33.246
<i>The ashes
were trampled into the earth,</i>

32
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.440
<i>and the blood became as snow.</i>

33
00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:39.050
<i>Who knows what they came for?</i>

34
00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:42.572
<i>Weapons of steel or murder?</i>

35
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.167
<i>It was never known,
for their leader rode to the south,</i>

36
00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:52.415
<i>while children went north
with the Vanir.</i>

37
00:13:53.497 --> 00:13:58.919
<i>No one would ever know
that my lord's people had lived at all.</i>

38
00:14:01.324 --> 00:14:05.094
<i>His was a tale of sorrow.</i>

39
00:17:35.995 --> 00:17:37.471
Sit here.

40
00:17:39.612 --> 00:17:41.252
Sit here!

41
00:19:55.177 --> 00:19:58.781
<i>He did not care anymore.</i>

42
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:04.119
<i>Life and death... the same.</i>

43
00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:09.228
<i>Only that the crowd
would be there to greet him</i>

44
00:20:09.253 --> 00:20:13.087
<i>with howls of lust and fury.</i>

45
00:20:14.582 --> 00:20:18.634
<i>He began to realize his sense of worth.</i>

46
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:21.470
<i>He mattered.</i>

47
00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.801
<i>In time, his victories
could not easily be counted.</i>

48
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:05.931
<i>He was taken to the east,
a great prize,</i>

49
00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:11.770
<i>where the war masters would teach him
the deepest secrets.</i>

50
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.173
<i>Language and writing
were made available.</i>

51
00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:44.053
<i>The poetry of Khitai,
the philosophy of Sung.</i>

52
00:21:51.374 --> 00:21:55.897
<i>And he also came to know
the pleasures of women,</i>

53
00:21:56.077 --> 00:22:00.194
<i>when he was bred to the finest stock.</i>

54
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:15.727
<i>But always there remained
the discipline of steel.</i>

55
00:23:26.243 --> 00:23:29.950
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

56
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:35.237
We've won again!

57
00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:39.854
This is good.
But what is best in life?

58
00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:42.182
The open steppe,

59
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.948
fleet horse,

60
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:48.779
falcons at your wrist,
and the wind in your hair.

61
00:23:48.841 --> 00:23:53.365
Wrong!
Conan, what is best in life?

62
00:23:53.654 --> 00:23:56.984
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you

63
00:23:57.109 --> 00:23:59.188
and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

64
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.570
That is good!

65
00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:02.437
That is good.

66
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.899
Go. Go, you're free!

67
00:24:48.612 --> 00:24:49.316
Go!

68
00:24:50.371 --> 00:24:53.700
<i>It has been surmised
that perhaps my lord</i>

69
00:24:53.784 --> 00:24:58.080
<i>was like a wild animal
that had been kept too long.</i>

70
00:24:58.191 --> 00:24:59.082
<i>Perhaps.</i>

71
00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:06.171
<i>But whatever freedom, so long
an unremembered dream, was his.</i>

72
00:25:36.268 --> 00:25:38.453
Aargh!

73
00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:08.995
Crom.

74
00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:36.009
There's warmth and fire.

75
00:30:40.046 --> 00:30:44.079
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

76
00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.519
They said you would come.

77
00:31:39.749 --> 00:31:44.069
<i>"From the north, a man of great strength.</i>

78
00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:48.698
<i>"A conqueror.</i>

79
00:31:50.825 --> 00:31:54.371
<i>"A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.</i>

80
00:31:56.253 --> 00:31:58.667
<i>"One who would crush the snakes
of the earth..."</i>

81
00:31:58.733 --> 00:32:01.086
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

82
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:10.720
- What is it you seek?
- A standard.

83
00:32:11.761 --> 00:32:13.386
A symbol.

84
00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:15.642
Perhaps on a shield.

85
00:32:16.546 --> 00:32:18.978
Two snakes coming together.

86
00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:24.567
Facing each other, but they're one.

87
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.698
With... with a sun and a moon below.

88
00:32:30.403 --> 00:32:34.341
Black sun... black moon.

89
00:32:34.403 --> 00:32:35.870
Yes.

90
00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.368
There's a price, barbarian.

91
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.467
Zamora!

92
00:32:52.617 --> 00:32:57.100
Crossroads of the world!

93
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.936
You will...

94
00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:07.563
...find what you want

95
00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:12.055
in Zamora!

96
00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:18.266
Crom!

97
00:34:41.534 --> 00:34:42.823
Food!

98
00:34:44.393 --> 00:34:45.526
Food!

99
00:34:51.003 --> 00:34:53.229
I have not eaten for days.

100
00:34:57.668 --> 00:34:59.528
And who says you will?

101
00:35:02.016 --> 00:35:05.770
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

102
00:35:07.407 --> 00:35:09.774
Let me die not in hunger...

103
00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:12.875
...but in combat.

104
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.040
Who are you?

105
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:22.036
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

106
00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:26.500
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

107
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.219
So, what are you doing here?

108
00:35:30.415 --> 00:35:32.110
Dinner for wolves.

109
00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.721
What gods do you pray to?

110
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.307
I pray to the four winds.

111
00:35:46.986 --> 00:35:50.273
- And you?
- To Crom.

112
00:35:55.643 --> 00:35:59.416
But I seldom pray to him.
He doesn't listen.

113
00:36:01.723 --> 00:36:03.828
What good is he, then?

114
00:36:04.511 --> 00:36:07.206
Eh, it's just as I've always said.

115
00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:08.917
He is strong.

116
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:11.433
If I die, I have to go before him,

117
00:36:12.237 --> 00:36:15.381
and he will ask me,
<i>"What is the riddle of steel?"</i>

118
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:18.716
If I don't know it, he will cast me
out of Valhalla and laugh at me.

119
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.073
That's Crom,
strong on his mountain.

120
00:36:23.674 --> 00:36:26.846
- Eh, my god is greater.
- Ha-ha!

121
00:36:26.909 --> 00:36:30.563
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.

122
00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:32.398
My god is stronger.

123
00:36:33.976 --> 00:36:36.611
He is the everlasting sky.

124
00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:40.415
Your god lives underneath him.

125
00:37:22.331 --> 00:37:25.448
Civilization, ancient and wicked.

126
00:37:25.682 --> 00:37:28.026
Have you ever seen this before?

127
00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:30.675
No. Let's waste no time.

128
00:37:50.325 --> 00:37:51.286
It's good.

129
00:37:51.458 --> 00:37:53.661
You have no idea
how long it's been there.

130
00:37:56.067 --> 00:37:58.609
What a stink!

131
00:37:59.973 --> 00:38:03.600
Does it always smell like this?
How does the wind ever get in here?

132
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:44.296
How about two snakes
coming together over a black sun?

133
00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:46.475
A magnificent standard.

134
00:38:46.655 --> 00:38:50.702
The only snakes I know of are those
of Set, in those cursed towers.

135
00:38:50.905 --> 00:38:52.796
They have spread to every city.

136
00:38:53.124 --> 00:38:55.491
Two, three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.

137
00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:57.225
Now, everywhere.

138
00:38:57.522 --> 00:39:01.669
It is said that they are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.

139
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.943
I know nothing.

140
00:39:05.138 --> 00:39:06.068
Hey...

141
00:39:11.474 --> 00:39:14.107
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

142
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:16.951
This better not be Haga.

143
00:39:17.068 --> 00:39:19.982
I would sell Haga to a slayer
such as you?

144
00:39:20.646 --> 00:39:24.935
- A pittance to protect you from evil.
- I am evil!

145
00:39:25.076 --> 00:39:26.989
They're all sluts.

146
00:39:29.219 --> 00:39:30.969
He's dead already.

147
00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:38.292
Can you believe that? Huh?

148
00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:40.795
- Ah.
- Can you bel...?

149
00:39:47.337 --> 00:39:50.072
You're too big to be a thief.

150
00:39:55.784 --> 00:39:57.770
Come. Let's leave this place.

151
00:40:03.754 --> 00:40:06.027
You're looking for snakes?

152
00:40:06.129 --> 00:40:08.582
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

153
00:40:08.668 --> 00:40:13.199
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all,

154
00:40:13.293 --> 00:40:15.621
the Eye of the Serpent.

155
00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.000
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

156
00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:03.457
- You are not a guard.
- Neither are you.

157
00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:07.106
We're thieves, huh, like yourself.

158
00:41:08.879 --> 00:41:11.988
- Come to climb the tower.
- You don't even have a rope.

159
00:41:14.463 --> 00:41:17.016
Two fools who laugh at death.

160
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.620
Do you know what horrors lie
beyond that wall?

161
00:41:21.698 --> 00:41:22.604
No.

162
00:41:25.752 --> 00:41:27.541
Then, you go first.

163
00:42:14.145 --> 00:42:16.466
What on earth could smell so bad?

164
00:42:16.591 --> 00:42:18.575
Do you want to live forever?

165
00:43:00.282 --> 00:43:04.473
That one. He's the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

166
00:43:05.027 --> 00:43:07.473
They say Thulsa Doom
is a thousand years old.

167
00:43:12.402 --> 00:43:14.611
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

168
00:47:35.047 --> 00:47:36.024
Infidels!

169
00:47:50.844 --> 00:47:52.141
Infidels!

170
00:48:15.663 --> 00:48:17.866
Ah! Kill them!

171
00:48:22.664 --> 00:48:26.166
Do you want to live forever?
Aargh! Ha-ha!

172
00:52:24.218 --> 00:52:29.521
<i>All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.</i>

173
00:52:30.679 --> 00:52:33.442
<i>Wealth can be wonderful.</i>

174
00:52:35.162 --> 00:52:39.662
<i>But you know,
success can test one's mettle</i>

175
00:52:39.732 --> 00:52:43.577
<i>as surely as the strongest adversary.</i>

176
00:53:08.265 --> 00:53:13.899
<i>They were taken
to the hall of King Osric, the Usurper.</i>

177
00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:17.986
<i>Once a powerful Northman like my lord,</i>

178
00:53:18.158 --> 00:53:21.531
<i>but now old and sotted.</i>

179
00:53:26.509 --> 00:53:28.720
These are the thieves
you have requested, sire.

180
00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:30.931
I thought there were three.

181
00:53:31.249 --> 00:53:36.103
Uh, our companion,
he died in the gardens. Lions ate him.

182
00:53:36.743 --> 00:53:37.900
Lions ate him?

183
00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.808
Lions ate him!

184
00:53:58.527 --> 00:53:59.795
You know what you've done?

185
00:54:02.256 --> 00:54:07.119
Why, Rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king!

186
00:54:07.935 --> 00:54:13.138
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!

187
00:54:20.996 --> 00:54:22.843
I salute you.

188
00:54:29.696 --> 00:54:31.743
Thulsa Doom...

189
00:54:32.243 --> 00:54:35.579
I've chafed for years at this demigod.

190
00:54:35.758 --> 00:54:38.525
Snakes in my beautiful city.

191
00:54:39.446 --> 00:54:44.579
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

192
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:48.422
Snakes!
Everywhere, these evil towers.

193
00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:52.622
You alone have stood up
to their guards. And what are you?

194
00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:54.891
Thieves!

195
00:55:01.926 --> 00:55:03.395
You see this?

196
00:55:04.473 --> 00:55:07.929
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

197
00:55:08.623 --> 00:55:12.686
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart

198
00:55:12.944 --> 00:55:15.103
by his very son.

199
00:55:16.342 --> 00:55:21.735
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

200
00:55:24.123 --> 00:55:28.408
Is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

201
00:55:31.318 --> 00:55:33.435
She follows him as a slave,

202
00:55:33.951 --> 00:55:37.123
seeking for the truth of her soul,

203
00:55:37.427 --> 00:55:40.099
as if I could not give it to her!

204
00:55:47.049 --> 00:55:52.252
As we speak,
my daughter travels east

205
00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:56.228
to Thulsa Doom
and his Mountain of Power.

206
00:55:57.752 --> 00:56:00.440
She is to be his!

207
00:56:09.607 --> 00:56:11.717
Steal my daughter back!

208
00:56:11.865 --> 00:56:13.795
Take all you can carry.

209
00:56:18.672 --> 00:56:23.213
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourselves.

210
00:56:28.453 --> 00:56:34.554
There comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle,

211
00:56:34.808 --> 00:56:38.037
when the gold loses its luster,

212
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.314
when the throne room
becomes a prison...

213
00:56:43.037 --> 00:56:47.988
...and all that is left
is a father's love for his child.

214
00:56:55.036 --> 00:56:58.116
To the hellfires with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.

215
00:56:58.171 --> 00:57:00.625
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

216
00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:05.964
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

217
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.010
Thousands of them.

218
00:57:10.822 --> 00:57:14.723
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

219
00:57:17.243 --> 00:57:20.187
I have talked to Subotai,
and he agrees.

220
00:57:21.104 --> 00:57:23.940
Let's take what we have while we live.

221
00:57:33.329 --> 00:57:36.286
I have never had so much as now.

222
00:57:37.861 --> 00:57:40.332
All my life, I've been alone.

223
00:57:43.072 --> 00:57:46.796
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

224
00:57:49.572 --> 00:57:53.548
I would look into the huts and the tents
of others in the coldest dark,

225
00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:57.432
and I would see figures
holding each other in the night.

226
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.770
But I always passed by.

227
00:58:05.663 --> 00:58:09.444
You and I, we have warmth.

228
00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:13.615
That's so hard to find in this world.

229
00:58:15.405 --> 00:58:20.080
Please, let someone else
pass by in the night.

230
00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:26.753
Let us take the world by the throat
and make it give us what we desire.

231
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:55.360
<i>The children of Doom.
Doom's children.</i>

232
01:00:55.443 --> 01:01:00.198
<i>They told my lord
the way to the Mountain of Power.</i>

233
01:01:00.281 --> 01:01:05.578
<i>They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.</i>

234
01:01:09.476 --> 01:01:12.961
<i>"Time enough for the earth in the grave."</i>

235
01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:25.308
<i>Oh...
Once, great men lived here.</i>

236
01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:30.079
<i>Giants, gods.
Once, but long ago.</i>

237
01:02:38.034 --> 01:02:41.112
<i>It was here that I met my master.</i>

238
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:43.878
<i>It was no accident.</i>

239
01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:49.849
<i>Nor is it mere chance
that I am the teller of his tale.</i>

240
01:02:52.448 --> 01:02:53.370
Hey!

241
01:02:56.769 --> 01:02:58.917
I'm a wizard, mind you!

242
01:02:59.495 --> 01:03:05.114
This place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.

243
01:03:05.331 --> 01:03:09.261
Harm my flesh, and you will have
to deal with the dead!

244
01:03:10.144 --> 01:03:12.058
Can you summon demons, Wizard?

245
01:03:12.566 --> 01:03:15.667
Yes! I strike at you.

246
01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:19.644
I would summon a demon
more ferocious than all in hell!

247
01:03:37.763 --> 01:03:41.146
Mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

248
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.405
Kings buried in them, great kings.

249
01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:50.493
Domains once glittered like the light
on a windy sea.

250
01:03:51.783 --> 01:03:56.275
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

251
01:03:56.471 --> 01:03:59.252
That's why I live down here in the wind.

252
01:04:00.775 --> 01:04:02.425
Do you care for these places?

253
01:04:02.852 --> 01:04:07.168
I sing to them on nights when they wish.

254
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:13.029
I sing of the tales of battles,
heroes, witches and women.

255
01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:15.826
Nobody bothers me down here.

256
01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.489
Not even... Thulsa Doom.

257
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:25.295
Do flowers grow around here?

258
01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:27.966
Flowers?

259
01:04:36.642 --> 01:04:37.915
Flowers...

260
01:04:39.548 --> 01:04:42.352
You've not come here as a pilgrim,
have you?

261
01:04:42.704 --> 01:04:45.485
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

262
01:04:46.063 --> 01:04:49.218
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

263
01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:52.142
No!

264
01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:59.177
Warrior, what are the flowers for?!

265
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.060
For a girl!

266
01:05:25.303 --> 01:05:28.694
Doom, Doom, Doom...

267
01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:42.021
Doom!

268
01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.526
Doom!

269
01:05:49.586 --> 01:05:51.739
Doom!

270
01:07:00.004 --> 01:07:01.926
Where do you think you're going,
brother?

271
01:07:02.676 --> 01:07:04.247
I am afraid.

272
01:07:04.543 --> 01:07:08.399
Afraid? To bare yourself? Why?

273
01:07:09.356 --> 01:07:11.700
You're so big and so well grown.

274
01:07:12.215 --> 01:07:14.340
You should be proud of your body.

275
01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:19.410
How do you expect to reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?

276
01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:25.082
Could we talk over there,
where the others cannot see?

277
01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:29.879
Why, yes, brother.
Of course.

278
01:07:43.695 --> 01:07:46.145
I am afraid and I am shy.

279
01:07:48.687 --> 01:07:50.900
Is this, uh, your robe?

280
01:07:52.276 --> 01:07:53.690
A priest's robe?

281
01:07:54.096 --> 01:07:56.280
Yes, it's all I have.

282
01:07:57.487 --> 01:07:58.667
Good.

283
01:08:02.448 --> 01:08:04.705
That's all you'll ever need.

284
01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.253
Brother.

285
01:09:55.469 --> 01:09:57.282
What do you see?

286
01:09:58.102 --> 01:10:00.112
Uh, infinity.

287
01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:02.899
Good.

288
01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:15.865
<i>I see you!</i>

289
01:11:18.677 --> 01:11:21.279
<i>I have watched you.</i>

290
01:11:21.434 --> 01:11:25.694
<i>For a thousand years,
I have watched you.</i>

291
01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.658
Doom!

292
01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.413
Doom!

293
01:11:34.405 --> 01:11:36.500
Doom!

294
01:11:38.451 --> 01:11:41.088
Doom!

295
01:11:52.451 --> 01:11:55.644
Who among you
still fears death?

296
01:11:57.164 --> 01:12:00.773
Who will not face emptiness?

297
01:12:01.437 --> 01:12:03.384
- Infidel!
- Infidel!

298
01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:12.828
Infidel!

299
01:13:02.745 --> 01:13:04.855
I wish to speak to you now.

300
01:13:13.748 --> 01:13:16.267
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?

301
01:13:19.913 --> 01:13:22.898
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.

302
01:13:24.022 --> 01:13:27.570
Probably for a mere
night's pleasure, hmm?

303
01:13:28.725 --> 01:13:30.389
What a loss.

304
01:13:32.123 --> 01:13:35.244
People have no grasp of what they do.

305
01:13:37.092 --> 01:13:41.209
You broke into my house,
stole my property,

306
01:13:41.608 --> 01:13:44.436
murdered my servants and my pets.

307
01:13:44.663 --> 01:13:47.938
And that is what grieves me the most.

308
01:13:48.829 --> 01:13:50.926
You killed my snake...

309
01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:55.139
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.

310
01:13:57.478 --> 01:14:01.478
He raised that snake
from the time it was born.

311
01:14:06.205 --> 01:14:08.314
You killed my mother...

312
01:14:08.775 --> 01:14:11.845
You killed my father!
You killed my people!

313
01:14:12.017 --> 01:14:14.241
You took my father's sword!

314
01:14:19.126 --> 01:14:21.498
It must have been
when I was younger.

315
01:14:22.532 --> 01:14:25.938
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel.

316
01:14:26.423 --> 01:14:30.382
When steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

317
01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.399
The riddle of steel.

318
01:14:36.298 --> 01:14:40.601
Yes. You know what it is,
don't you, boy?

319
01:14:41.532 --> 01:14:45.581
Shall I tell you?
It's the least I can do.

320
01:14:47.409 --> 01:14:52.886
Steel isn't strong, boy.
Flesh is stronger.

321
01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.172
Look around you.

322
01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.787
There, on the rocks.

323
01:15:01.532 --> 01:15:03.680
That beautiful girl...

324
01:15:04.805 --> 01:15:06.196
Come to me, my child.

325
01:15:16.899 --> 01:15:19.610
That is strength, boy.

326
01:15:19.837 --> 01:15:21.946
That is power.

327
01:15:22.133 --> 01:15:24.603
The strength and power of flesh.

328
01:15:25.712 --> 01:15:29.587
What is steel compared
to the hand that wields it?

329
01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:34.266
Look at the strength of your body,
the desire in your heart.

330
01:15:34.643 --> 01:15:36.699
I gave you this.

331
01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.785
Such a waste.

332
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.015
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.

333
01:15:52.378 --> 01:15:53.847
Crucify him.

334
01:18:55.582 --> 01:18:56.918
He said you were a wizard.

335
01:18:58.949 --> 01:19:00.832
Do the gods owe you any favors?

336
01:19:04.847 --> 01:19:09.425
There are dangers,
but I see you care little for those.

337
01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.961
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

338
01:19:13.039 --> 01:19:14.430
Then I will pay them!

339
01:20:10.641 --> 01:20:11.821
Drink.

340
01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:25.134
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.

341
01:20:25.376 --> 01:20:29.241
- And if they succeed...
- If they succeed, you'll follow.

342
01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.919
No! No!

343
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.933
Ah! No!

344
01:22:29.535 --> 01:22:32.280
Stop! Stop!

345
01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:03.329
They're gone.

346
01:23:06.446 --> 01:23:07.626
They're gone!

347
01:24:02.039 --> 01:24:04.727
All the gods, they cannot sever us.

348
01:24:05.008 --> 01:24:07.961
If I were dead
and you still fighting for life,

349
01:24:07.986 --> 01:24:10.094
I'd come back from the darkness,

350
01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:14.925
back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.

351
01:25:29.476 --> 01:25:32.437
The old man says
the Mountain of Power is hollow.

352
01:25:33.765 --> 01:25:36.023
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.

353
01:25:37.319 --> 01:25:39.108
What else does he say?

354
01:25:39.733 --> 01:25:44.616
That in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge. Many caves.

355
01:25:46.108 --> 01:25:48.974
A good thief could get in there,
steal the princess and be off,

356
01:25:48.999 --> 01:25:50.741
before she's missed in the darkness.

357
01:25:51.796 --> 01:25:55.374
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

358
01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:03.033
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

359
01:26:07.812 --> 01:26:08.960
Agreed?

360
01:26:11.655 --> 01:26:12.983
Conan?

361
01:31:05.008 --> 01:31:07.063
So, this is paradise...

362
01:31:13.767 --> 01:31:15.783
The princess...

363
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.741
Get them!

364
01:35:34.142 --> 01:35:35.080
Come on!

365
01:35:44.496 --> 01:35:45.871
You...

366
01:38:00.363 --> 01:38:01.598
Help him.

367
01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:11.191
The infidel defilers...

368
01:38:12.363 --> 01:38:15.246
...they shall all drown in lakes of blood.

369
01:38:15.855 --> 01:38:19.417
Now they will know
why they are afraid of the dark.

370
01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:23.564
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

371
01:38:58.085 --> 01:38:59.850
Seek.

372
01:39:50.475 --> 01:39:55.030
The wizard...
I told him I would pay the gods.

373
01:40:12.375 --> 01:40:13.924
Hold me.

374
01:40:17.031 --> 01:40:18.375
Kiss me.

375
01:40:19.477 --> 01:40:21.056
Kiss me.

376
01:40:26.774 --> 01:40:30.065
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

377
01:40:32.088 --> 01:40:34.153
I'm so cold...

378
01:40:40.096 --> 01:40:41.827
So... cold...

379
01:40:45.432 --> 01:40:47.416
Keep... me...

380
01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:51.921
...warm...

381
01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.759
Keep...

382
01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:00.638
...me...

383
01:41:58.763 --> 01:42:03.158
Hey, fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.

384
01:42:41.134 --> 01:42:43.157
Why do you cry?

385
01:42:44.399 --> 01:42:47.286
He is Conan, Cimmerian.

386
01:42:48.665 --> 01:42:50.391
He won't cry.

387
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.627
So, I cry for him.

388
01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:23.617
He will kill you.
He has seen your fires.

389
01:44:23.695 --> 01:44:26.805
He will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you!

390
01:44:42.426 --> 01:44:46.462
I remember days like this,
when my father took me to the forest...

391
01:44:47.692 --> 01:44:50.367
...and we ate wild blueberries.

392
01:44:50.833 --> 01:44:52.989
More than twenty years ago...

393
01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:56.582
I was just a boy of four or five...

394
01:44:58.505 --> 01:45:01.587
The leaves were so dark and green then.

395
01:45:02.723 --> 01:45:06.133
The grass smelt sweet with the spring wind.

396
01:45:10.653 --> 01:45:13.640
Almost twenty years of pitiless combat!

397
01:45:13.944 --> 01:45:16.852
No rest, no sleep like other men.

398
01:45:17.835 --> 01:45:20.577
And yet the spring wind blows, Subotai.

399
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.984
Have you ever felt such a wind?

400
01:45:24.999 --> 01:45:27.404
They blow where I live, too.

401
01:45:29.845 --> 01:45:32.451
In the north of every man's heart.

402
01:45:34.813 --> 01:45:37.017
It's never too late, Subotai.

403
01:45:37.884 --> 01:45:39.017
No...

404
01:45:41.993 --> 01:45:45.089
It would only lead me back here,
another day...

405
01:45:47.751 --> 01:45:49.401
In even worse company!

406
01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:59.686
For us, there is no spring.

407
01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:04.316
Just the wind that smells fresh,
before the storm.

408
01:46:53.292 --> 01:46:56.042
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get this stuff?

409
01:46:56.285 --> 01:46:57.339
The dead.

410
01:46:57.565 --> 01:47:02.176
The gods are pleased with you.
They will watch the battle. Heh!

411
01:47:02.374 --> 01:47:05.114
- Are they going to help?
- No! Ha-ha!

412
01:47:05.153 --> 01:47:08.130
Well, then, tell them
to stay out of the way!

413
01:48:35.759 --> 01:48:37.177
Crom...

414
01:48:38.339 --> 01:48:43.339
...I have never prayed to you before.
I have no tongue for it.

415
01:48:44.113 --> 01:48:49.231
<i>No one, not even you, will remember
if we were good men or bad.</i>

416
01:48:49.925 --> 01:48:54.278
<i>Why we fought
or why we died. No.</i>

417
01:48:54.558 --> 01:48:57.691
<i>All that matters is that
two stood against many.</i>

418
01:48:57.917 --> 01:49:00.381
<i>That's what's important.</i>

419
01:49:00.784 --> 01:49:06.003
<i>Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.</i>

420
01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:09.293
Grant me revenge.

421
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:14.715
And if you do not listen,
then to hell with you!

422
01:51:45.114 --> 01:51:45.797
Hyah!

423
01:52:39.932 --> 01:52:44.151
- That's how we do it.
- I did it. With my spear!

424
01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:56.098
Do you want to live forever?

425
01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:52.313
Doom!

426
01:54:52.508 --> 01:54:55.657
Don't leave me! My lord!

427
01:55:03.925 --> 01:55:06.246
No! Don't kill me!

428
01:55:12.507 --> 01:55:14.157
Father!

429
01:55:20.733 --> 01:55:21.260
Ah...!

430
01:55:32.412 --> 01:55:34.271
Hey!

431
01:57:39.062 --> 01:57:41.874
The purging is at last at hand.

432
01:57:42.273 --> 01:57:44.781
The day of doom is here!

433
01:57:49.912 --> 01:57:53.459
<i>All that is evil, all their lies...</i>

434
01:57:53.755 --> 01:57:56.318
<i>your parents, your leaders,</i>

435
01:57:56.521 --> 01:58:00.380
<i>those who would call themselves
your judges!</i>

436
01:58:00.795 --> 01:58:03.474
Those who have lied

437
01:58:03.771 --> 01:58:06.214
and corrupted the earth!

438
01:58:06.605 --> 01:58:08.456
They shall all be cleansed.

439
01:58:13.558 --> 01:58:16.183
<i>You, my children, are the water...</i>

440
01:58:16.917 --> 01:58:20.552
<i>...that will wash away
all that has gone before.</i>

441
01:58:21.287 --> 01:58:24.810
<i>In your hand, you hold my light.</i>

442
01:58:25.209 --> 01:58:27.990
<i>The gleam in the eye of Set.</i>

443
01:58:28.357 --> 01:58:32.286
This flame will burn away the darkness,

444
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:37.130
burn you the way to paradise!

445
01:59:13.395 --> 01:59:15.635
My child...

446
01:59:16.128 --> 01:59:18.693
You have come to me, my son...

447
01:59:20.635 --> 01:59:23.957
For who now is your father,
if it is not me?

448
01:59:25.581 --> 01:59:27.926
Who gave you the will to live?

449
01:59:30.142 --> 01:59:34.009
I am the well spring from which you flow.

450
01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:38.129
When I am gone...

451
01:59:39.051 --> 01:59:41.653
...you will have never been.

452
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:47.430
What will your world be... without me?

453
01:59:51.444 --> 01:59:53.694
My son.

454
01:59:56.764 --> 01:59:58.691
My son.
