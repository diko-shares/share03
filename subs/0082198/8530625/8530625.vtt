1
00:00:54.306 --> 00:00:58.976
Between the time when
the oceans drank Atlantis

2
00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:02.772
and the rise of the sons of Aryas,

3
00:01:02.773 --> 00:01:06.526
there was an age undreamed of.

4
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:09.529
And unto this, Conan,

5
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.324
destined to bear
the jeweled crown of Aquilonia

6
00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:16.118
upon a troubled brow.

7
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.621
It is I, his chronicler,

8
00:01:18.622 --> 00:01:21.624
who alone can tell thee of his saga.

9
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:27.589
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

10
00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:13.587
Fire and wind come from the sky,

11
00:04:13.588 --> 00:04:16.008
from the gods of the sky.

12
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:18.509
But Crom is your god.

13
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.221
Crom, and he lives in the earth.

14
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:25.434
Once, giants lived in the earth, Conan.

15
00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:30.730
And in the darkness of chaos,
they fooled Crom,

16
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.983
and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

17
00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:37.945
Crom was angered, and the earth shook.

18
00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:40.531
And fire and wind struck down these giants

19
00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:42.868
and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

20
00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:48.456
But in their rage, the gods
forgot the secret of steel

21
00:04:48.457 --> 00:04:50.792
and left it on the battlefield.

22
00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.919
And we who found it

23
00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:56.006
are just men.

24
00:04:57.549 --> 00:05:00.469
Not gods, not giants.

25
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.804
Just men.

26
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.768
The secret of steel has always
carried with it a mystery.

27
00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:13.482
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

28
00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:18.986
For no one, no one in
this world can you trust.

29
00:05:18.987 --> 00:05:22.074
Not men, not women, not beasts.

30
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:28.163
This you can trust.

31
00:08:26.675 --> 00:08:29.552
Kill that one first!

32
00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:54.035
Over there! Crush them!

33
00:08:59.916 --> 00:09:02.460
You! Get him!

34
00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:33.480
The ashes were
trampled into the earth,

35
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:36.358
and the blood became as snow.

36
00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:39.152
Who knows what they came for?

37
00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:42.365
Weapons of steel or murder?

38
00:13:43.491 --> 00:13:48.370
It was never known,
for their leader rode to the south

39
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:52.125
while children went north with the Vanir.

40
00:13:53.543 --> 00:13:58.923
No one would ever know that
my lord's people had lived at all.

41
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:04.887
His was a tale of sorrow.

42
00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:37.266
Sit here.

43
00:17:39.644 --> 00:17:40.770
Sit here!

44
00:19:55.112 --> 00:19:58.782
He did not care anymore.

45
00:19:58.783 --> 00:20:01.577
Life and death,

46
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.330
the same.

47
00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:07.082
Only that the crowd

48
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:12.922
would be there to greet him
with howls of lust and fury.

49
00:20:14.674 --> 00:20:18.552
He began to realize his sense of worth.

50
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.347
He mattered.

51
00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:56.423
In time,

52
00:20:56.424 --> 00:21:00.844
his victories could not easily be counted.

53
00:21:00.845 --> 00:21:05.807
He was taken to the East, a great prize,

54
00:21:05.808 --> 00:21:10.813
where the war masters would teach him
the deepest secrets.

55
00:21:35.337 --> 00:21:39.049
Language and writing
were made available.

56
00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.217
The poetry of Khitai.

57
00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:43.929
The philosophy of Sung.

58
00:21:51.395 --> 00:21:56.024
And he also came to know
the pleasures of women

59
00:21:56.025 --> 00:22:00.196
when he was bred to the finest stock.

60
00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:15.646
But always there remained
the discipline of steel.

61
00:23:26.282 --> 00:23:29.243
My fear is that
my sons will never understand me.

62
00:23:33.622 --> 00:23:34.873
We've won again.

63
00:23:34.874 --> 00:23:37.834
This is good.

64
00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:39.920
But what is best in life?

65
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.839
The open steppe,

66
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:44.048
fleet horse,

67
00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:46.384
falcons at your wrist,

68
00:23:46.385 --> 00:23:48.845
and the wind in your hair.

69
00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:49.930
Wrong!

70
00:23:50.681 --> 00:23:53.433
Conan, what is best in life?

71
00:23:53.434 --> 00:23:57.020
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you,

72
00:23:57.021 --> 00:23:58.938
and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

73
00:23:58.939 --> 00:24:00.149
That is good.

74
00:24:01.525 --> 00:24:03.068
That is good.

75
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.734
Go. Go. You're free.

76
00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:50.240
Go.

77
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:51.950
It has been surmised

78
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:55.453
that perhaps my lord
was like a wild animal

79
00:24:55.454 --> 00:24:58.164
that had been kept too long.

80
00:24:58.165 --> 00:25:00.500
Perhaps, but whatever.

81
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:06.090
Freedom, so long
an unremembered dream, was his.

82
00:29:06.622 --> 00:29:08.457
Crom.

83
00:30:34.293 --> 00:30:36.086
There's warmth and fire.

84
00:30:40.132 --> 00:30:43.552
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

85
00:31:34.144 --> 00:31:35.354
They said you would come.

86
00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:43.987
From the north, a man of great strength.

87
00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:48.575
A conqueror.

88
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:54.373
A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.

89
00:31:56.291 --> 00:31:58.584
One who would crush
the snakes of the earth...

90
00:31:58.585 --> 00:32:00.962
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

91
00:32:07.427 --> 00:32:09.178
What is it you seek?

92
00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:10.639
A standard.

93
00:32:11.765 --> 00:32:12.891
A symbol.

94
00:32:13.809 --> 00:32:15.394
Perhaps on a shield.

95
00:32:16.603 --> 00:32:18.772
Two snakes coming together.

96
00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:22.234
Facing each other.

97
00:32:23.402 --> 00:32:24.444
But they're one.

98
00:32:25.237 --> 00:32:29.574
With... With a sun and a moon below.

99
00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.286
Black sun, black moon.

100
00:32:34.287 --> 00:32:36.123
Yes.

101
00:32:38.792 --> 00:32:41.211
There's a price, barbarian.

102
00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:49.386
Zamora.

103
00:32:52.681 --> 00:32:57.476
Crossroads of the world.

104
00:32:57.477 --> 00:33:00.772
You will...

105
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:07.737
...find what you want

106
00:33:07.738 --> 00:33:12.075
in Zamora.

107
00:34:17.182 --> 00:34:18.350
Crom.

108
00:34:41.623 --> 00:34:42.749
Food.

109
00:34:44.459 --> 00:34:45.544
Food.

110
00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:53.552
I have not eaten for days.

111
00:34:57.681 --> 00:34:59.224
And who says you will?

112
00:35:02.143 --> 00:35:05.689
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

113
00:35:07.524 --> 00:35:09.276
Let me die not in hunger

114
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.946
but in combat.

115
00:35:13.947 --> 00:35:15.115
Who are you?

116
00:35:18.243 --> 00:35:21.913
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

117
00:35:23.373 --> 00:35:24.457
I am Hyrkanian.

118
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.792
The great order of Kurlit.

119
00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:28.295
So, what are you doing here?

120
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:31.965
Dinner for wolves.

121
00:35:37.637 --> 00:35:39.180
What gods do you pray to?

122
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.145
I pray to the four winds.

123
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.898
And you?

124
00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.858
To Crom.

125
00:35:55.739 --> 00:35:57.157
But I seldom pray to him.

126
00:35:58.241 --> 00:35:59.492
He doesn't listen.

127
00:36:01.745 --> 00:36:03.330
What good is he, then?

128
00:36:04.623 --> 00:36:06.750
It's just as I've always said.

129
00:36:07.542 --> 00:36:08.543
He is strong.

130
00:36:09.669 --> 00:36:11.504
If I die, I have to go before him,

131
00:36:12.339 --> 00:36:15.466
and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"

132
00:36:15.467 --> 00:36:18.886
If I don't know it, he will cast me
out of Valhalla and laugh at me.

133
00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:22.140
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.

134
00:36:23.808 --> 00:36:25.894
My god is greater.

135
00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:30.522
Crom laughs at your four winds.
Laughs from his mountain.

136
00:36:30.523 --> 00:36:32.359
My god is stronger.

137
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:36.446
He is the everlasting sky.

138
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:40.492
Your god lives underneath him.

139
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.661
Civilization, ancient and wicked.

140
00:37:25.662 --> 00:37:27.539
Have you ever seen this before?

141
00:37:28.289 --> 00:37:30.583
No. Let's waste no time.

142
00:37:49.644 --> 00:37:51.437
It's good.

143
00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.565
You have no idea how long it's been there.

144
00:37:55.984 --> 00:37:58.445
So much meat. Stink.

145
00:38:00.071 --> 00:38:01.989
Does it always smell like this?

146
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.700
How does the wind ever get in here?

147
00:38:39.277 --> 00:38:44.323
How about two snakes coming
together over a black sun?

148
00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:46.700
A magnificent standard.

149
00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:48.702
The only snakes I know of
are those of Set,

150
00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:50.913
in those cursed towers.

151
00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:52.873
They have spread to every city.

152
00:38:52.874 --> 00:38:55.542
Two, three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.

153
00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:57.294
Now, everywhere.

154
00:38:57.295 --> 00:38:59.922
It is said that they are deceivers.

155
00:38:59.923 --> 00:39:01.882
They murder people in the night.

156
00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:03.134
I know nothing.

157
00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:06.137
Hey.

158
00:39:11.476 --> 00:39:14.187
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

159
00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:17.064
This better not be Haga.

160
00:39:17.065 --> 00:39:19.442
I would sell Haga to a slayer such as you?

161
00:39:20.735 --> 00:39:23.320
A pittance to protect you from evil.

162
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:25.114
I am evil.

163
00:39:25.115 --> 00:39:26.533
They're all sluts.

164
00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:30.703
He's dead already.

165
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.502
Can you believe that?

166
00:39:38.503 --> 00:39:40.213
Can you be...?

167
00:39:47.387 --> 00:39:49.556
You're too big to be a thief.

168
00:39:55.895 --> 00:39:57.689
Come. Let's leave this place.

169
00:40:03.903 --> 00:40:05.572
You looking for snakes?

170
00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:08.699
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

171
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.287
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...

172
00:40:13.288 --> 00:40:15.706
The Eye of the Serpent.

173
00:40:15.707 --> 00:40:18.918
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

174
00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:01.836
You are not a guard.

175
00:41:02.462 --> 00:41:04.129
Neither are you.

176
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.175
We're thieves. Like yourself.

177
00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:10.177
Come to climb the tower.

178
00:41:10.178 --> 00:41:12.055
You don't even have a rope.

179
00:41:14.515 --> 00:41:17.060
Two fools who laugh at death.

180
00:41:18.353 --> 00:41:20.688
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

181
00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:22.357
No.

182
00:41:25.693 --> 00:41:27.612
Then you go first.

183
00:42:14.075 --> 00:42:16.493
What on earth could smell so bad?

184
00:42:16.494 --> 00:42:18.162
Do you want to live forever?

185
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.497
That one.

186
00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:04.542
He's the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

187
00:43:05.043 --> 00:43:07.545
They say Thulsa Doom's
a thousand years old.

188
00:43:12.508 --> 00:43:14.677
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

189
00:47:35.146 --> 00:47:36.479
Infidels!

190
00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.317
Infidels!

191
00:47:50.745 --> 00:47:53.122
Infidels!

192
00:48:16.812 --> 00:48:19.815
Kill them!

193
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:24.111
Do you wanna live forever?

194
00:52:05.666 --> 00:52:06.709
Sold.

195
00:52:24.268 --> 00:52:29.398
All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.

196
00:52:30.649 --> 00:52:33.235
Wealth can be wonderful.

197
00:52:34.987 --> 00:52:39.574
But, you know,
success can test one's mettle

198
00:52:39.575 --> 00:52:43.621
as surely as the strongest adversary.

199
00:53:08.354 --> 00:53:13.317
They were taken to the hall
of King Osric the Usurper,

200
00:53:13.984 --> 00:53:18.154
once a powerful Northman like my lord,

201
00:53:18.155 --> 00:53:21.408
but now old and sotted.

202
00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:28.791
These are the thieves
you have requested, sire.

203
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.000
I thought there were three.

204
00:53:31.001 --> 00:53:34.545
Our companion, he died in the gardens.

205
00:53:34.546 --> 00:53:36.173
Lions ate him.

206
00:53:36.799 --> 00:53:37.967
Lions ate him?

207
00:53:45.683 --> 00:53:47.685
Lions ate him.

208
00:53:58.612 --> 00:53:59.863
You know what you've done?

209
00:54:02.324 --> 00:54:04.534
Why, Rexor himself has come before me,

210
00:54:04.535 --> 00:54:07.037
threatened me, the king.

211
00:54:07.871 --> 00:54:11.082
What daring! What outrageousness!

212
00:54:11.083 --> 00:54:13.210
What insolence! What arrogance!

213
00:54:21.051 --> 00:54:22.428
I salute you.

214
00:54:29.768 --> 00:54:31.687
Thulsa Doom.

215
00:54:32.312 --> 00:54:35.732
I've chafed for years at this demigod.

216
00:54:35.733 --> 00:54:38.527
Snakes in my beautiful city.

217
00:54:39.528 --> 00:54:44.699
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

218
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:45.908
Snakes.

219
00:54:45.909 --> 00:54:48.870
Everywhere, these evil towers.

220
00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:51.164
You alone have stood up to their guards.

221
00:54:51.165 --> 00:54:52.750
And what are you?

222
00:54:53.584 --> 00:54:54.960
Thieves.

223
00:55:01.925 --> 00:55:03.469
You see this?

224
00:55:04.553 --> 00:55:08.389
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

225
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:12.894
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart

226
00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:14.772
by his very son.

227
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.737
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

228
00:55:24.198 --> 00:55:28.452
Is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

229
00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:33.207
She follows him as a slave

230
00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:37.460
seeking for the truth of her soul,

231
00:55:37.461 --> 00:55:40.172
as if I could not give it to her.

232
00:55:47.137 --> 00:55:48.263
As we speak,

233
00:55:49.181 --> 00:55:52.101
my daughter travels east

234
00:55:52.684 --> 00:55:56.313
to Thulsa Doom and his Mountain of Power.

235
00:55:57.898 --> 00:56:00.400
She is to be his.

236
00:56:09.701 --> 00:56:13.872
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.

237
00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.962
There's more. There's much more.

238
00:56:20.963 --> 00:56:23.132
Enough to become kings yourselves.

239
00:56:28.512 --> 00:56:30.597
There comes a time, thief,

240
00:56:31.515 --> 00:56:34.101
when the jewels cease to sparkle,

241
00:56:34.977 --> 00:56:37.479
when the gold loses its luster,

242
00:56:38.355 --> 00:56:41.066
when the throne room becomes a prison,

243
00:56:43.152 --> 00:56:44.736
and all that is left

244
00:56:45.237 --> 00:56:47.865
is a father's love for his child.

245
00:56:55.038 --> 00:56:57.081
To the hell fires with Thulsa Doom.

246
00:56:57.082 --> 00:56:58.166
He's evil.

247
00:56:58.167 --> 00:57:00.586
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

248
00:57:02.004 --> 00:57:05.924
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

249
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:09.469
Thousands of them.

250
00:57:10.846 --> 00:57:14.349
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

251
00:57:17.269 --> 00:57:20.063
I have talked to Subotai and he agrees.

252
00:57:20.981 --> 00:57:23.317
Let's take what we have while we live.

253
00:57:33.327 --> 00:57:35.787
I have never had so much as now.

254
00:57:37.915 --> 00:57:40.083
All my life, I've been alone.

255
00:57:42.961 --> 00:57:46.381
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

256
00:57:49.676 --> 00:57:53.387
I would look into the huts and the tents
of others in the coldest dark

257
00:57:53.388 --> 00:57:56.642
and I would see figures
holding each other in the night.

258
00:57:59.478 --> 00:58:01.438
But I always passed by.

259
00:58:05.692 --> 00:58:07.110
You and I,

260
00:58:07.903 --> 00:58:09.238
we have warmth.

261
00:58:10.447 --> 00:58:12.699
That's so hard to find in this world.

262
00:58:15.202 --> 00:58:19.915
Please, let someone else
pass by in the night.

263
00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:23.918
Let us take the world by the throat

264
00:58:23.919 --> 00:58:25.879
and make it give us what we desire.

265
01:00:49.648 --> 01:00:55.277
The children of Doom.
Doom's children.

266
01:00:55.278 --> 01:01:00.157
They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.

267
01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:05.580
They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.

268
01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:12.796
Time enough for the earth in the grave.

269
01:02:22.365 --> 01:02:25.284
Once, great men lived here.

270
01:02:25.285 --> 01:02:28.078
Giants, gods.

271
01:02:28.079 --> 01:02:29.998
Once, but long ago.

272
01:02:38.089 --> 01:02:41.342
It was here that I met my master.

273
01:02:41.343 --> 01:02:43.969
It was no accident,

274
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:49.809
nor is it mere chance
that I am the teller of his tale.

275
01:02:52.437 --> 01:02:53.438
Hey!

276
01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.610
I'm a wizard, mind you.

277
01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:02.655
This place is kept by powerful gods

278
01:03:02.656 --> 01:03:04.990
and spirits of kings.

279
01:03:04.991 --> 01:03:09.329
Harm my flesh
and you will have to deal with the dead.

280
01:03:10.163 --> 01:03:12.122
Can you summon demons, wizard?

281
01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:15.751
Yes! I strike at you.

282
01:03:15.752 --> 01:03:19.714
I would summon a demon
more ferocious than all in Hell.

283
01:03:37.774 --> 01:03:41.194
Mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

284
01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.240
Kings buried in them, great kings.

285
01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:50.328
Domains once glittered like
the light on the windy sea.

286
01:03:51.830 --> 01:03:56.292
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

287
01:03:56.293 --> 01:03:58.837
That's why I live down here in the wind.

288
01:04:00.755 --> 01:04:02.215
Do you care for these places?

289
01:04:02.924 --> 01:04:07.344
I sing to them on nights when they wish.

290
01:04:07.345 --> 01:04:13.101
I sing of the tales of battles,
heroes, witches, and women.

291
01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:15.978
Nobody bothers me down here.

292
01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:19.566
Not even Thulsa Doom.

293
01:04:23.737 --> 01:04:25.363
Do flowers grow around here?

294
01:04:26.406 --> 01:04:27.532
Flowers?

295
01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.917
Flowers.

296
01:04:39.628 --> 01:04:42.671
You've not come here
as a pilgrim, have you?

297
01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:45.258
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

298
01:04:46.092 --> 01:04:48.762
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

299
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.057
No!

300
01:04:55.143 --> 01:04:59.064
Warrior, what are the flowers for?

301
01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:00.982
For a girl.

302
01:05:24.839 --> 01:05:28.510
Doom, Doom, Doom...

303
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:41.773
Doom.

304
01:05:44.359 --> 01:05:47.445
Doom.

305
01:05:49.489 --> 01:05:52.826
Doom.

306
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:39.748
Doom! Doom!

307
01:07:00.018 --> 01:07:01.811
Where do you think you're going, brother?

308
01:07:02.771 --> 01:07:03.897
I am afraid.

309
01:07:04.647 --> 01:07:08.109
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?

310
01:07:09.402 --> 01:07:11.529
You're so big and so well-grown.

311
01:07:12.238 --> 01:07:13.990
You should be proud of your body.

312
01:07:14.908 --> 01:07:17.367
How do you expect to reach emptiness

313
01:07:17.368 --> 01:07:19.204
without knowing your own body?

314
01:07:20.538 --> 01:07:22.290
Could we talk over there

315
01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:25.126
where the others cannot see?

316
01:07:25.877 --> 01:07:29.756
Why, yes, brother. Of course.

317
01:07:43.686 --> 01:07:45.980
I am afraid and I am shy.

318
01:07:48.775 --> 01:07:50.735
Is this... your robe?

319
01:07:52.445 --> 01:07:53.488
Priest's robe?

320
01:07:54.197 --> 01:07:55.949
Yes, it's all I have.

321
01:07:57.534 --> 01:07:58.576
Good.

322
01:08:02.497 --> 01:08:04.374
That's all you'll ever need.

323
01:08:08.336 --> 01:08:09.295
Brother.

324
01:09:55.526 --> 01:09:56.861
What do you see?

325
01:09:58.154 --> 01:09:59.906
Infinity.

326
01:10:01.741 --> 01:10:02.784
Good.

327
01:11:13.813 --> 01:11:15.773
I see you.

328
01:11:18.735 --> 01:11:21.528
I have watched you.

329
01:11:21.529 --> 01:11:25.657
For a thousand years, I have watched you.

330
01:11:25.658 --> 01:11:28.619
Doom.

331
01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:33.082
Doom.

332
01:11:34.459 --> 01:11:37.128
Doom.

333
01:11:38.212 --> 01:11:41.424
Doom.

334
01:11:52.477 --> 01:11:55.521
Who among you still fears death?

335
01:11:57.190 --> 01:12:00.359
Who will not face emptiness?

336
01:12:01.444 --> 01:12:03.946
- Infidel!
- Infidel!

337
01:13:02.839 --> 01:13:04.507
I wish to speak to you now.

338
01:13:13.808 --> 01:13:16.144
Where is the Eye of the Serpent?

339
01:13:20.022 --> 01:13:22.692
Rexor says that you gave it to a girl.

340
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.363
Probably for a mere night's pleasure.

341
01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:29.949
What a loss.

342
01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:34.704
People have no grasp of what they do.

343
01:13:37.165 --> 01:13:40.918
You broke into my house,
stole my property,

344
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:44.671
murdered my servants and my pets.

345
01:13:44.672 --> 01:13:47.633
And that is what grieves me the most.

346
01:13:48.843 --> 01:13:50.720
You killed my snake.

347
01:13:51.846 --> 01:13:54.891
Thorgrim is beside himself with grief.

348
01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.439
He raised that snake
from the time it was born.

349
01:14:06.277 --> 01:14:07.653
You killed my mother.

350
01:14:08.863 --> 01:14:11.907
You killed my father.
You killed my people!

351
01:14:11.908 --> 01:14:14.076
You took my father's sword.

352
01:14:19.165 --> 01:14:20.958
It must have been when I was younger.

353
01:14:22.585 --> 01:14:25.630
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel.

354
01:14:26.589 --> 01:14:30.259
When steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

355
01:14:32.553 --> 01:14:35.473
The riddle of steel.

356
01:14:36.349 --> 01:14:37.600
Yes.

357
01:14:38.184 --> 01:14:40.478
You know what it is, don't you, boy?

358
01:14:41.646 --> 01:14:44.982
Shall I tell you? It's the least I can do.

359
01:14:47.485 --> 01:14:52.490
Steel isn't strong, boy.
Flesh is stronger.

360
01:14:53.282 --> 01:14:54.283
Look around you.

361
01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.664
There, on the rocks.

362
01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:03.042
That beautiful girl.

363
01:15:04.877 --> 01:15:06.420
Come to me, my child.

364
01:15:16.806 --> 01:15:19.808
That is strength, boy.

365
01:15:19.809 --> 01:15:22.018
That is power.

366
01:15:22.019 --> 01:15:24.689
The strength and power of flesh.

367
01:15:25.523 --> 01:15:29.652
What is steel
compared to the hand that wields it?

368
01:15:30.319 --> 01:15:32.362
Look at the strength of your body.

369
01:15:32.363 --> 01:15:34.240
The desire in your heart.

370
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.534
I gave you this.

371
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:39.287
Such a waste.

372
01:15:42.999 --> 01:15:46.085
Contemplate this on the Tree of Woe.

373
01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:53.843
Crucify him.

374
01:18:55.566 --> 01:18:56.984
He said you were a wizard.

375
01:18:59.028 --> 01:19:00.905
Do the gods owe you any favors?

376
01:19:04.909 --> 01:19:06.243
There are dangers,

377
01:19:06.994 --> 01:19:09.537
but I see you care little for those.

378
01:19:09.538 --> 01:19:13.333
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

379
01:19:13.334 --> 01:19:14.502
Then I will pay them.

380
01:20:10.641 --> 01:20:11.850
Drink.

381
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:25.321
Sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.

382
01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:26.864
And if they succeed...

383
01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:29.159
If they succeed, you'll follow.

384
01:22:01.752 --> 01:22:03.796
No! No!

385
01:22:16.725 --> 01:22:17.851
No!

386
01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:32.282
Stop! Stop!

387
01:23:02.396 --> 01:23:03.397
They're gone.

388
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.693
They're gone!

389
01:24:02.039 --> 01:24:04.791
All the gods, they cannot sever us.

390
01:24:04.792 --> 01:24:07.960
If I were dead
and you still fighting for life,

391
01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:09.713
I'd come back from the darkness,

392
01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:14.760
back from the pit of Hell
to fight at your side.

393
01:25:29.585 --> 01:25:32.379
The old man says
the Mountain of Power is hollow.

394
01:25:33.797 --> 01:25:35.632
Thulsa Doom lives in the mountain.

395
01:25:37.426 --> 01:25:39.177
What else does he say?

396
01:25:39.803 --> 01:25:42.180
That in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge.

397
01:25:43.682 --> 01:25:44.683
Many caves.

398
01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:48.436
A good thief could get in there,
steal the princess

399
01:25:48.437 --> 01:25:50.814
and be off before she's missed
in the darkness.

400
01:25:51.857 --> 01:25:54.985
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

401
01:25:59.031 --> 01:26:00.406
Only the girl.

402
01:26:00.407 --> 01:26:02.868
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

403
01:26:07.873 --> 01:26:09.041
Agreed?

404
01:26:11.752 --> 01:26:12.794
Conan?

405
01:31:04.753 --> 01:31:07.130
So, this is paradise.

406
01:31:13.929 --> 01:31:15.180
Princess.

407
01:35:16.713 --> 01:35:17.714
Get them!

408
01:35:34.022 --> 01:35:35.106
Come on!

409
01:35:44.532 --> 01:35:45.950
You.

410
01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:01.628
Help him.

411
01:38:08.718 --> 01:38:11.262
The infidel defilers,

412
01:38:12.347 --> 01:38:14.891
they shall all drown in lakes of blood.

413
01:38:15.892 --> 01:38:19.437
Now they will know
why they are afraid of the dark.

414
01:38:20.021 --> 01:38:23.399
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

415
01:38:58.101 --> 01:38:59.519
Seek.

416
01:39:50.528 --> 01:39:55.116
The wizard.
I told him I would pay the gods.

417
01:40:12.425 --> 01:40:13.593
Hold me.

418
01:40:16.888 --> 01:40:18.181
Kiss me.

419
01:40:19.515 --> 01:40:20.641
Kiss me.

420
01:40:26.814 --> 01:40:30.193
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

421
01:40:32.195 --> 01:40:33.654
I'm so cold.

422
01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:41.704
So cold.

423
01:40:45.541 --> 01:40:47.251
Keep me...

424
01:40:50.171 --> 01:40:51.631
warm.

425
01:40:55.218 --> 01:40:56.385
Keep...

426
01:40:58.387 --> 01:41:00.515
me...

427
01:41:58.823 --> 01:42:03.119
Hey. Fire won't burn up there.
No fire at all.

428
01:42:41.115 --> 01:42:42.450
Why do you cry?

429
01:42:44.493 --> 01:42:47.079
He is Conan, Cimmerian.

430
01:42:48.706 --> 01:42:49.874
He won't cry.

431
01:42:52.668 --> 01:42:54.045
So, I cry for him.

432
01:44:20.297 --> 01:44:23.675
He will kill you!
He has seen your fires!

433
01:44:23.676 --> 01:44:26.971
He will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you!

434
01:45:30.159 --> 01:45:32.952
Hey, old man. Where'd you get this stuff?

435
01:45:32.953 --> 01:45:34.621
The dead.

436
01:45:34.622 --> 01:45:36.664
The gods are pleased with you.

437
01:45:36.665 --> 01:45:39.375
They will watch the battle.

438
01:45:39.376 --> 01:45:42.003
- Are they going to help?
- No.

439
01:45:42.004 --> 01:45:44.047
Well, then tell them to stay
out of the way.

440
01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:14.013
Crom...

441
01:47:15.306 --> 01:47:17.266
I have never prayed to you before.

442
01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:20.436
I have no tongue for it.

443
01:47:21.145 --> 01:47:23.897
No one, not even you, will remember

444
01:47:23.898 --> 01:47:26.108
if we were good men or bad.

445
01:47:26.859 --> 01:47:29.777
Why we fought or why we died.

446
01:47:29.778 --> 01:47:31.154
No.

447
01:47:31.155 --> 01:47:34.782
All that matters
is that two stood against many.

448
01:47:34.783 --> 01:47:36.535
That's what's important.

449
01:47:37.786 --> 01:47:43.083
Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.

450
01:47:44.084 --> 01:47:46.128
Grant me revenge!

451
01:47:47.630 --> 01:47:51.842
And if you do not listen,
then to Hell with you.

452
01:51:17.256 --> 01:51:20.843
- That's how we do it.
- I did it. With my spear.

453
01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:33.165
Do you want to live forever?

454
01:53:27.344 --> 01:53:29.428
Doom!

455
01:53:29.429 --> 01:53:32.724
Don't leave me! My lord!

456
01:53:41.066 --> 01:53:43.318
No, don't kill me!

457
01:53:49.408 --> 01:53:51.118
Father!

458
01:54:59.311 --> 01:55:05.567
Doom.

459
01:55:07.027 --> 01:55:09.488
Doom.

460
01:55:11.323 --> 01:55:14.368
Doom.

461
01:55:15.994 --> 01:55:18.747
Doom.

462
01:55:20.374 --> 01:55:22.959
Doom.

463
01:56:16.179 --> 01:56:18.807
The purging is at last at hand.

464
01:56:19.474 --> 01:56:21.852
The day of doom is here.

465
01:56:26.982 --> 01:56:30.735
All that is evil,
all that have eyes,

466
01:56:30.736 --> 01:56:33.446
your parents, your leaders,

467
01:56:33.447 --> 01:56:37.451
those who would call themselves
your judges!

468
01:56:37.909 --> 01:56:40.078
Those who have lied

469
01:56:40.829 --> 01:56:43.414
and corrupted the earth!

470
01:56:43.415 --> 01:56:46.125
They shall all be cleansed!

471
01:56:46.126 --> 01:56:49.588
Doom.

472
01:56:50.547 --> 01:56:53.258
You, my children, are the water

473
01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:57.345
that will wash away
all that has gone before.

474
01:56:58.305 --> 01:57:01.641
In your hand, you hold my light.

475
01:57:02.225 --> 01:57:05.060
A gleam in the eye of Set.

476
01:57:05.061 --> 01:57:09.357
This flame will burn away the darkness.

477
01:57:10.025 --> 01:57:14.528
Burn you away to paradise!

478
01:57:14.529 --> 01:57:16.448
Doom.

479
01:57:18.366 --> 01:57:21.286
Doom.

480
01:57:22.496 --> 01:57:25.332
Doom.

481
01:57:27.459 --> 01:57:29.294
Doom.

482
01:57:31.546 --> 01:57:33.840
Doom.

483
01:57:50.482 --> 01:57:51.650
My child.

484
01:57:53.235 --> 01:57:55.153
You have come to me, my son.

485
01:57:57.697 --> 01:58:01.034
For who now is your father
if it is not me?

486
01:58:02.619 --> 01:58:04.496
Who gave you the will to live?

487
01:58:07.123 --> 01:58:10.836
I am the wellspring from which you flow.

488
01:58:13.129 --> 01:58:14.464
When I am gone,

489
01:58:16.132 --> 01:58:17.676
you will have never been.

490
01:58:20.011 --> 01:58:22.013
What will your world be

491
01:58:22.931 --> 01:58:24.182
without me?

492
01:58:28.436 --> 01:58:29.646
My son.

493
01:58:33.608 --> 01:58:35.193
My son.
