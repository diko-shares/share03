<i>October 7, 2007.</i>

2
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:16.271
<i>Four days till we deploy.</i>

3
00:01:17.573 --> 00:01:20.565
<i>Grace knows I would do anything
to get back to her.</i>

4
00:01:21.277 --> 00:01:22.471
<i>Anything.</i>

5
00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.139
<i>Today I wrote her a letter.</i>

6
00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:42.423
Good afternoon, sir. I have the briefing
papers from the colonel's office.

7
00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:44.294
Put them on the desk.

8
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.033
Thank you, Corporal.

9
00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.443
Major. Hey.

10
00:01:59.882 --> 00:02:01.782
Hope you don't have to deliver it.

11
00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:04.476
Copy that.

12
00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:06.616
- Be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

13
00:02:06.756 --> 00:02:08.986
- See you when you get back.
- All right.

14
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.396
How's this?

15
00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:19.592
Warm.

16
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:24.870
- Hello.
- Dad!

17
00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:27.066
Hey! Hey, baby.

18
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.370
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing?

19
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:30.172
- How was school?
- Great.

20
00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:34.375
They gave me Noodles the dog.
She's in my room.

21
00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:37.315
Izzie?

22
00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:40.185
Hey.

23
00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:43.218
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.894
What's wrong, honey?

25
00:02:46.028 --> 00:02:47.757
You're leaving again.

26
00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:50.359
Come give your daddy a hug.

27
00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:51.999
No.

28
00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.900
Come on. Give me a kiss, honey.

29
00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:56.197
Just go.

30
00:02:56.772 --> 00:02:59.104
- Two kisses?
- No.

31
00:03:00.076 --> 00:03:01.475
Three kisses?

32
00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:04.009
I wanna read my book.

33
00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:06.080
You wanna read your book?

34
00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:08.945
Oh, yeah?

35
00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:15.924
I see a smile coming. There it is! There it is!
Now, you're getting 100 kisses!

36
00:03:16.092 --> 00:03:19.493
- Behind you! Right behind you!
- What? What? What? Who? Who?

37
00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:24.665
Wait a second! Two against one.
That is no fair!

38
00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:26.324
Daddy, put me down!

39
00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:27.401
Girls.

40
00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:31.432
- Come on. Daddy's gotta go.
- Okay.

41
00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:35.010
Please stay. Please let him stay.

42
00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:38.705
- Yeah. Can't you stay?
- It's my brother.

43
00:03:38.848 --> 00:03:40.679
He doesn't deserve you.

44
00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:44.412
Go rob another bank, Tommy!

45
00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:47.185
Bring that money back to me, brother!

46
00:03:56.332 --> 00:03:57.765
See you later.

47
00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:24.083
What happened to my little brother?

48
00:04:35.304 --> 00:04:36.566
No fucking way.

49
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.891
You ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

50
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.862
It's green.

51
00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:07.896
I got it.

52
00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.240
So, what are you gonna do?

53
00:05:22.385 --> 00:05:27.687
I don't know. I'm just gonna
cash this check, and then who knows.

54
00:05:28.224 --> 00:05:30.059
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

55
00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.719
- Don't rob the place.
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

56
00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:49.543
No hot water in this place?

57
00:05:51.447 --> 00:05:53.347
Fucking hot water is missing.

58
00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:02.349
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:02.525 --> 00:06:04.652
How do you stand this kitchen?

60
00:06:05.227 --> 00:06:07.661
He didn't expect to be deploying again
so soon.

61
00:06:07.797 --> 00:06:09.526
Yeah. Well, are you ripping your hair out?

62
00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:11.963
What are you gonna do?
They call, you answer.

63
00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:13.693
- Don't tell her. Oh, no.
- Yes!

64
00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:15.736
- I won.
- She got you, Granddad.

65
00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:17.771
You're raising a real hustler here, Grace.

66
00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:19.238
I know.

67
00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:25.940
My birthday's this spring.

68
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.515
It is, isn't it?
What is it, March 10th, something like that?

69
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:34.747
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:37.449
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie.

71
00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:39.116
Isabelle's big.

72
00:06:40.362 --> 00:06:41.886
I'm Tommy.

73
00:06:42.064 --> 00:06:43.554
Mom doesn't like you.

74
00:06:43.732 --> 00:06:44.824
Maggie!

75
00:06:44.967 --> 00:06:47.333
What? That's what you said to Dad.

76
00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:50.402
These are for your mom.

77
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:53.431
Mom, they're for you.

78
00:06:53.576 --> 00:06:54.838
Thank you.

79
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:56.771
Come in.

80
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.012
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

81
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.674
Come here.

82
00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:04.676
Hi.

83
00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:06.453
You made it.

84
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:08.779
Yeah.

85
00:07:12.361 --> 00:07:13.623
- Son.
- Sir.

86
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.494
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:07:19.635 --> 00:07:22.502
Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts
which we are about to receive

88
00:07:22.638 --> 00:07:24.572
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

89
00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:25.935
- Amen.
- Amen.

90
00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:30.444
And this is a very special meal for us
because we are welcoming one son home,

91
00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:33.446
and we're sending another one off.

92
00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:37.848
And we ask you, Lord, to keep him safe
and bring him back really soon. Right?

93
00:07:37.987 --> 00:07:38.976
- Yeah.
- Amen.

94
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:40.452
- Amen.
- Amen.

95
00:07:41.123 --> 00:07:42.613
Here. You can do it.

96
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:44.554
- You wanna try?
- Thank you, Mom.

97
00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:47.161
- Here, let me.
- Thanks, Mama.

98
00:07:48.964 --> 00:07:50.226
Carrots are delicious.

99
00:07:57.706 --> 00:08:00.766
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

100
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:03.673
I do, too.

101
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.705
Honey, eat your peas.

102
00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:07.781
Okay, Dad.

103
00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:09.248
I like peas.

104
00:08:10.085 --> 00:08:11.518
So do I.

105
00:08:11.654 --> 00:08:13.884
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

106
00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:19.217
You love it over there, huh?

107
00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:22.194
It's my job.

108
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:24.458
They only shoot the bad guys.

109
00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.796
Who are the bad guys?

110
00:08:29.038 --> 00:08:30.505
The ones with the beards.

111
00:08:34.376 --> 00:08:36.241
Your brother's a hero.

112
00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:40.271
He's serving his country,
and don't you ever forget that.

113
00:08:42.985 --> 00:08:45.317
Will you be here for my birthday?

114
00:08:46.155 --> 00:08:48.089
You know I will, sweetie.

115
00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:51.645
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't there
for her birthday.

116
00:08:51.894 --> 00:08:54.226
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

117
00:08:54.363 --> 00:08:56.923
She had to bring him a cake in prison.

118
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.532
It's not just military families.

119
00:09:00.669 --> 00:09:03.263
There's a lot of folks under pressure
these days.

120
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:06.969
They got problems in all walks of life.

121
00:09:08.444 --> 00:09:11.311
Every family's got
their own set of problems.

122
00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:15.315
They sure do.

123
00:09:19.188 --> 00:09:21.315
What is that supposed to mean?

124
00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:27.852
Every family has their own set of problems.

125
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:30.260
You sound like a damn parrot.

126
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.661
Like a what?

127
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.564
Why don't you try mimicking your brother
for a change?

128
00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:35.931
Dad.

129
00:09:37.573 --> 00:09:40.098
This food is great, Elsie. Thank you.

130
00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:43.535
Compared to what?

131
00:09:48.617 --> 00:09:49.982
Other food.

132
00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:51.643
Prison food?

133
00:09:51.787 --> 00:09:52.879
Tommy!

134
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:00.723
Excuse me.

135
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.060
It's okay, honey.

136
00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:09.295
- No. No.
- It's his first night out.

137
00:10:09.438 --> 00:10:13.704
He comes waltzing in here
with no regard for anybody else.

138
00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:15.901
Doesn't even bother to apologize...

139
00:10:31.226 --> 00:10:32.887
Stay out of trouble.

140
00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:36.826
All right.

141
00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:43.803
You be safe over there. All right?

142
00:10:56.385 --> 00:10:58.080
This thing's not coming off.

143
00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.615
- Try more soap.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.223
Almost got it.

145
00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:08.996
There we go.

146
00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:13.894
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

147
00:11:14.036 --> 00:11:15.230
Okay.

148
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.071
- Take a lot of pictures when I'm gone.
- I always do.

149
00:11:25.781 --> 00:11:27.078
I love you.

150
00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:29.440
I love you, too.

151
00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:00.105
Sam?

152
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:03.909
Take me with you.

153
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:06.645
Sure.

154
00:12:10.692 --> 00:12:13.490
How about I go and you stay with the kids?

155
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:17.257
Okay.

156
00:12:21.403 --> 00:12:22.836
Don't go.

157
00:12:29.178 --> 00:12:30.873
<i>October 12, 2007.</i>

158
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.180
<i>Back in Afghanistan with my men.</i>

159
00:12:37.486 --> 00:12:40.853
<i>Weird. It almost feels like home.</i>

160
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.390
Hi, Cassie. Joe Jr. is so big.

161
00:13:43.652 --> 00:13:45.119
What's the distance to the LZ?

162
00:13:45.254 --> 00:13:48.280
We're three minutes out.
Clear to detach to the LZ.

163
00:13:48.457 --> 00:13:49.481
Roger that.

164
00:13:56.498 --> 00:13:58.932
<i>Clear to engage. Weapons hot.</i>

165
00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:02.431
<i>Target took cover in the valley.</i>

166
00:14:02.571 --> 00:14:03.765
Little bastards...

167
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.800
Who is it?

168
00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:46.005
It's Captain Sanderson and Chaplain Davis.

169
00:14:49.551 --> 00:14:50.483
Hi.

170
00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:55.150
- Hi. Is your mother home?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:57.326 --> 00:14:58.725
Where is she?

172
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:00.760
In the bath.

173
00:15:03.332 --> 00:15:05.459
Would you call her for us, please?

174
00:15:09.905 --> 00:15:11.338
What's wrong?

175
00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:15.270
Izzie.

176
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:18.076
- Okay.
- Bye.

177
00:15:32.694 --> 00:15:34.161
Come in.

178
00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:12.325
<i>You've reached Captain Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.</i>

179
00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:23.102
<i>You've reached Captain Sam Cahill.
Please leave a message.</i>

180
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:40.594
Grace.

181
00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:44.865
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

182
00:16:47.002 --> 00:16:48.282
I was just dropping off the car.

183
00:16:48.403 --> 00:16:51.804
Sam told me I could borrow it
whenever I wanted, so...

184
00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:57.137
The taillight's a little busted.
Some asshole...

185
00:17:02.617 --> 00:17:04.312
Look, you know...

186
00:17:06.054 --> 00:17:07.489
Just say it, you know what I mean?
All right.

187
00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.422
He told me I could borrow the car
whenever I wanted, Grace.

188
00:17:10.592 --> 00:17:12.060
You look at me with this pissed-off look.

189
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.593
Sam's dead.

190
00:17:16.998 --> 00:17:18.397
They crashed.

191
00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:22.760
- What are you talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

192
00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:25.202
Come in, come in.

193
00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:33.774
I don't wanna fucking come in.

194
00:17:35.684 --> 00:17:37.948
I just came here to drop off...

195
00:17:38.787 --> 00:17:42.052
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

196
00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:46.126
- Why didn't anybody call me?
- We've all been trying, Tommy.

197
00:17:47.829 --> 00:17:49.057
Okay.

198
00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:54.727
- Why'd you let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy.

199
00:17:58.006 --> 00:18:00.065
For what now, huh?

200
00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:18.952
Tommy, come inside.

201
00:18:20.962 --> 00:18:23.396
I just had to sit down for a second.

202
00:18:31.106 --> 00:18:33.939
He's with your mama now. They're together.

203
00:19:06.041 --> 00:19:07.201
Drink?

204
00:19:10.078 --> 00:19:11.067
No.

205
00:19:42.777 --> 00:19:44.802
Girls? You ready?

206
00:19:45.914 --> 00:19:48.439
Yeah, in about just one minute.

207
00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:53.415
- Why'd you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

208
00:19:54.823 --> 00:19:57.792
We're going to put it on, okay?
We have to go.

209
00:19:58.193 --> 00:19:59.683
I don't want to.

210
00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:04.065
I don't want to wear mine either. It's itchy.

211
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.511
Okay, come here. Okay.

212
00:20:21.383 --> 00:20:22.816
Come here.

213
00:20:27.889 --> 00:20:30.983
- Okay.
- Is Dad really dead like your mom and dad?

214
00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:22.767
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it.

215
00:21:31.853 --> 00:21:34.447
- I'm so sorry, dear.
- Thanks for coming.

216
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.924
Sir, your son's the best damn Marine
I ever commanded.

217
00:21:38.093 --> 00:21:39.526
I appreciate it.

218
00:21:42.931 --> 00:21:44.398
- Come on, girls.
- Coming, Grandpa.

219
00:21:44.566 --> 00:21:46.431
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Maggie.

220
00:21:46.568 --> 00:21:49.093
- Elsie, I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'll watch them.

221
00:21:49.237 --> 00:21:50.329
Okay.

222
00:21:50.472 --> 00:21:55.409
Grace, Sam wrote this for you before he left.
He never wanted me to have to deliver it.

223
00:22:01.616 --> 00:22:03.584
I don't believe it, John.

224
00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:06.010
I can't feel it.

225
00:22:07.722 --> 00:22:09.952
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

226
00:22:10.925 --> 00:22:14.827
It's hard to accept.
He was a good friend, a good Marine.

227
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:19.498
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

228
00:22:19.634 --> 00:22:22.000
- Come on, girls.
- Coming.

229
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:25.135
Hey, why don't you give me the keys, Dad?

230
00:22:25.273 --> 00:22:27.073
What makes you so responsible
all of a sudden?

231
00:22:29.144 --> 00:22:30.702
Let Tommy drive.

232
00:22:30.845 --> 00:22:33.177
"Let Tommy drive." Look, I'll tell you what.

233
00:22:33.314 --> 00:22:35.544
Why don't you get a job
and earn some money,

234
00:22:35.683 --> 00:22:36.809
buy yourself a car,

235
00:22:36.951 --> 00:22:39.920
and then you can drive it
wherever the hell you want.

236
00:22:40.054 --> 00:22:41.544
Give me the keys.

237
00:22:44.125 --> 00:22:47.754
Did you hear those Marines in there today
talking about your brother?

238
00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:49.123
Did you?

239
00:22:50.165 --> 00:22:54.534
Who is gonna stand up and testify for you
once you're dead?

240
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.401
Yeah, it's my fault Sam's dead. Right?
That's what you think.

241
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:03.434
It's got nothing to do with you. Right?

242
00:23:04.379 --> 00:23:07.177
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

243
00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:11.717
Forget it.

244
00:23:12.787 --> 00:23:14.584
You never had any guts.

245
00:23:14.722 --> 00:23:16.314
And you did.

246
00:23:16.958 --> 00:23:18.860
That's why you screamed at Mom
every fucking night.

247
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.554
That's why you drove us drunk, huh?
"Hang in there, Marines."

248
00:23:21.729 --> 00:23:25.062
- Don't. Come on.
- Why you put all that shit in his head.

249
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.327
- You could never fill his shoes.
- I know that.

250
00:23:27.469 --> 00:23:29.994
- Never could make me proud.
- For Lord's sake.

251
00:23:30.138 --> 00:23:31.765
That is a sin.

252
00:23:31.906 --> 00:23:35.342
- Stop it. Give me the keys.
- Here you go. I'm walking.

253
00:25:07.168 --> 00:25:08.897
This is a nightmare.

254
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:11.895
What's going on?

255
00:25:12.473 --> 00:25:14.703
What are they gonna do with us?

256
00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:18.410
That yours?

257
00:25:19.347 --> 00:25:20.371
Yeah.

258
00:25:21.082 --> 00:25:22.549
That your wife?

259
00:25:23.284 --> 00:25:24.683
Cassie, yeah.

260
00:25:26.387 --> 00:25:27.820
No, she's not.

261
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.953
You don't have a wife.

262
00:25:31.392 --> 00:25:33.189
You don't have a family.

263
00:25:34.295 --> 00:25:36.456
I'm the only person you know.

264
00:25:36.998 --> 00:25:41.765
It's Private Willis and Captain Cahill.
You know nothing else.

265
00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.131
Yes, sir.

266
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.851
- Hello?
- Grace.

267
00:26:05.026 --> 00:26:05.958
<i>Tommy?</i>

268
00:26:07.028 --> 00:26:10.691
- Hi. I know it's like 1:00 in the morning.
- Yeah. It's 3:00.

269
00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:12.994
It's 3:00 in the morning.

270
00:26:13.134 --> 00:26:14.624
Okay. I had...

271
00:26:15.737 --> 00:26:18.171
I had a couple of drinks and, apparently,

272
00:26:18.306 --> 00:26:21.798
they're the most expensive drinks
in the world. And...

273
00:26:23.244 --> 00:26:25.269
Now I owe, like, $47.

274
00:26:27.382 --> 00:26:29.145
I was gonna just walk out, but then

275
00:26:29.283 --> 00:26:32.377
this guy says that
he was gonna nick me on a disorderly.

276
00:26:33.354 --> 00:26:35.584
<i>And then I'd lose my parole, so...</i>

277
00:26:38.026 --> 00:26:39.288
Which bar?

278
00:26:50.772 --> 00:26:53.240
Your nose is like the lunar eclipse.

279
00:26:54.509 --> 00:26:57.011
- Come on, let me touch it. Let me just...
- Get your hands off me, Tommy.

280
00:26:57.111 --> 00:27:00.205
- Let me just touch it for a sec.
- Tommy, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you.

281
00:27:00.348 --> 00:27:01.474
Don't get so upset with me.

282
00:27:01.616 --> 00:27:03.311
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

283
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:05.078
See. Nothing to it. Right?

284
00:27:05.219 --> 00:27:07.278
- Big deal.
- That thing's huge, man.

285
00:27:07.422 --> 00:27:09.014
- Hi.
- Great.

286
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.091
- How much does he owe you?
- $47 and two broken glasses.

287
00:27:12.226 --> 00:27:14.194
- Well, how about we say...
- Ready?

288
00:27:14.362 --> 00:27:16.592
- Come on, Cyrano.
- Get your hands off the bar.

289
00:27:16.731 --> 00:27:20.189
- Don't try to ignore it. That thing's huge.
- How about we say $50. Okay?

290
00:27:20.334 --> 00:27:21.869
- I don't care about the money...
- That thing's huge.

291
00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:23.938
...just get him out of here.
I'm gonna call the cops. I'm done.

292
00:27:24.038 --> 00:27:27.872
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at 3:00 in the morning.

293
00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:29.840
You think you're funny?

294
00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:34.642
Go home.

295
00:27:49.263 --> 00:27:50.628
Oh, God.

296
00:27:54.235 --> 00:27:56.601
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

297
00:27:56.738 --> 00:28:00.265
- I don't think I should be carrying a child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay?

298
00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:01.773
Oh, my God.

299
00:28:09.484 --> 00:28:11.349
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

300
00:28:11.486 --> 00:28:13.386
Uncle Tommy, wake up.

301
00:28:16.157 --> 00:28:17.920
Can you stop that?

302
00:28:18.092 --> 00:28:21.789
I'm making pancakes for Mom.
I can't stop. My sister said.

303
00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:27.398
Stop it.

304
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:29.395
No.

305
00:28:40.982 --> 00:28:42.973
What are you doing here?

306
00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:45.950
You want me to whisk in your face, too?

307
00:28:46.087 --> 00:28:49.545
This is not your house,
and you're not the boss of me.

308
00:28:56.197 --> 00:28:57.357
Come on.

309
00:29:03.171 --> 00:29:05.833
We're making pancakes for Mom,
so she won't be sad.

310
00:29:05.973 --> 00:29:08.908
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

311
00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:10.442
I know that.

312
00:29:10.578 --> 00:29:13.479
No drinking out of the carton! It's gross!

313
00:29:15.216 --> 00:29:17.013
Shut up. You're gross.

314
00:29:17.785 --> 00:29:19.776
- No!
- You want a pancake?

315
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:21.946
No, I don't like pancakes.

316
00:29:22.623 --> 00:29:26.286
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, all right?

317
00:29:26.994 --> 00:29:29.224
Mom! You're supposed to be upstairs.

318
00:29:29.363 --> 00:29:31.456
- What are you doing awake?
- It's a surprise!

319
00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:34.796
I am surprised. Thank you.

320
00:29:34.936 --> 00:29:38.372
The nicest little girls in the world.

321
00:29:41.209 --> 00:29:42.233
Who's that?

322
00:29:44.378 --> 00:29:46.039
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

323
00:29:46.814 --> 00:29:48.247
- Hey, babies.
- Hi!

324
00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:51.078
- What have you got in your hair?
- Pancake batter.

325
00:29:51.219 --> 00:29:53.414
- Pancake batter.
- Hi, sweetie.

326
00:29:54.655 --> 00:29:57.488
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

327
00:29:58.226 --> 00:30:00.387
- I'll get the syrup.
- What a mess.

328
00:30:00.561 --> 00:30:03.826
- Bye, Tommy.
- We'll clean this up later.

329
00:30:17.678 --> 00:30:19.009
Morning.

330
00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:23.908
Pancakes, huh?

331
00:30:25.786 --> 00:30:29.153
Yeah, actually there's one on the floor
if you want it.

332
00:30:37.798 --> 00:30:41.632
- What are they doing in here?
- They were making pancakes.

333
00:30:48.342 --> 00:30:49.274
Look...

334
00:30:51.178 --> 00:30:54.272
- I was a little stupid the other day.
- Yeah, hey.

335
00:30:55.917 --> 00:31:00.047
- I was okay to drive, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

336
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.700
I know Sam was always smarter than me.

337
00:31:26.514 --> 00:31:30.848
Well, I don't know about smarter.
He was a damn good athlete.

338
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:36.715
Remember that game against Easton?

339
00:31:36.891 --> 00:31:38.916
Cool as ice.

340
00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:48.727
You had some talent, too, you know.
I mean...

341
00:31:50.671 --> 00:31:52.468
You just quit all the time.

342
00:31:52.606 --> 00:31:55.734
Now, that was the difference
between you and him.

343
00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.410
Sam had no quit in him.

344
00:32:22.636 --> 00:32:25.469
I'd cut my throat to bring him back, Dad.

345
00:32:32.847 --> 00:32:34.576
God damn it.

346
00:32:34.715 --> 00:32:39.345
I don't know how she lives
with this kitchen the way it is.

347
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:52.891
Private, come here. Fucking help me.

348
00:32:53.034 --> 00:32:54.763
I can't see anything.

349
00:32:57.138 --> 00:32:58.628
They're looking for us.

350
00:33:00.975 --> 00:33:02.306
All right.

351
00:33:21.295 --> 00:33:23.991
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

352
00:33:45.286 --> 00:33:48.255
Come on, man. Just put it where you got it.

353
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:50.016
Grace. Hey.

354
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:54.025
You remember, A.J., Owen.

355
00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:01.333
Sweeney... I don't remember
your first name.

356
00:34:01.469 --> 00:34:02.834
There's a reason for that.

357
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.165
- It's nice to meet you, Grace.
- You, too.

358
00:34:06.107 --> 00:34:07.631
What's going on?

359
00:34:10.711 --> 00:34:12.804
We're just fixing up the kitchen for you.

360
00:34:14.415 --> 00:34:15.541
Tommy.

361
00:34:19.787 --> 00:34:21.414
Were you ever going to run this by me?

362
00:34:21.555 --> 00:34:24.023
- Can you believe it? She's gorgeous.
- It's my house.

363
00:34:24.158 --> 00:34:25.693
- Somebody's all growed up.
- It's not funny.

364
00:34:25.793 --> 00:34:28.956
What the hell is wrong with you guys?
She's been...

365
00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:31.121
You have to run this by me.

366
00:34:35.803 --> 00:34:37.031
I was...

367
00:34:41.742 --> 00:34:45.234
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

368
00:34:46.413 --> 00:34:49.576
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer, too.

369
00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:52.080
Don't tell them anything.

370
00:34:52.219 --> 00:34:54.119
Don't you tell them anything, Private.

371
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:57.080
They're not asking me anything.

372
00:34:58.159 --> 00:34:59.592
They're just starving us.

373
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.352
Stay calm, Private.

374
00:35:02.763 --> 00:35:06.199
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

375
00:35:06.367 --> 00:35:10.201
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

376
00:35:10.337 --> 00:35:13.773
What the fuck did you save me for?
Why did you come after me?

377
00:35:15.042 --> 00:35:18.205
I should've drowned in that lake.
We'd both be better off dead.

378
00:35:20.948 --> 00:35:22.438
What day is it?

379
00:35:34.762 --> 00:35:36.024
Saturday.

380
00:35:38.432 --> 00:35:39.990
What time is it?

381
00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:49.237
About noon.

382
00:36:20.241 --> 00:36:22.004
You remember what I told you.

383
00:36:22.176 --> 00:36:26.374
No information. You give them nothing.
You give them nothing, Private.

384
00:36:26.513 --> 00:36:27.502
Yeah.

385
00:36:36.857 --> 00:36:39.849
- Where are they taking us?
- Don't speak. Don't speak!

386
00:36:45.165 --> 00:36:48.225
- Are they gonna cut our heads off?
- Not another fucking word!

387
00:37:28.842 --> 00:37:30.036
Welcome.

388
00:37:42.022 --> 00:37:44.252
I used the satellite phone to call my wife.

389
00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:46.652
She's pregnant.

390
00:37:47.695 --> 00:37:50.721
I jeopardized your location
and your mission.

391
00:37:52.933 --> 00:37:53.853
We have the same blood.

392
00:37:55.736 --> 00:37:57.727
Syed is my nephew.

393
00:38:21.795 --> 00:38:23.092
Fuck them.

394
00:38:32.439 --> 00:38:33.736
This is our country.

395
00:38:35.709 --> 00:38:37.540
You should not be here.

396
00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:43.806
Tell this message to America.

397
00:38:44.985 --> 00:38:45.917
You say it,

398
00:38:48.288 --> 00:38:50.188
or I'll force you to say it.

399
00:39:38.839 --> 00:39:40.500
The girls are back.

400
00:39:40.941 --> 00:39:43.068
It's a good thing downstairs.

401
00:39:48.982 --> 00:39:50.813
I'll see you tomorrow.

402
00:39:52.519 --> 00:39:53.781
Thanks, Elsie.

403
00:39:55.022 --> 00:39:55.954
Okay.

404
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:06.060
- Who is painting the kitchen?
- I am.

405
00:40:08.902 --> 00:40:09.903
Get that spot right there.

406
00:40:10.003 --> 00:40:12.801
You know, your dad
was a great football player in high school.

407
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.305
- Really?
- Yeah.

408
00:40:15.075 --> 00:40:18.044
He was small,
but he was a great quarterback.

409
00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:23.446
Me and A.J. and Owen used to go
to the games just to watch him play.

410
00:40:25.519 --> 00:40:26.854
Did you ever have a chance
to see him play?

411
00:40:26.954 --> 00:40:27.921
No.

412
00:40:28.055 --> 00:40:30.615
- Izzie, you're so tall.
- Thanks.

413
00:40:34.194 --> 00:40:36.992
- Good job, Mag.
- Thanks, Mom.

414
00:40:44.137 --> 00:40:46.002
Do they need to
do their homework or something?

415
00:40:46.139 --> 00:40:48.403
No. She's having fun.

416
00:40:50.444 --> 00:40:51.638
Get these real good.

417
00:40:53.046 --> 00:40:54.104
Shit the bed!

418
00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:59.080
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

419
00:41:03.023 --> 00:41:04.786
These are brand new pants.

420
00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:07.186
- Hey, man...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:09.430
Chill out, man. She said she was sorry.

422
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.363
It's okay, Maggie.
I think I have something for you, okay?

423
00:41:12.499 --> 00:41:13.634
- Just wait here.
- Do you have a bathroom...

424
00:41:13.734 --> 00:41:16.396
No. Please don't bring the paint in, okay?

425
00:41:16.537 --> 00:41:19.506
- It's not that bad, man.
- Take it easy, man.

426
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.165
There's almost nothing on you, man.
You look fine.

427
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:25.836
That will come out.
I mean, the real major cleanup is the floor.

428
00:41:25.979 --> 00:41:27.071
You're such a dick.

429
00:41:27.214 --> 00:41:29.910
- Looks like it just grazed you.
- It doesn't look that bad.

430
00:41:33.887 --> 00:41:34.785
You're right.

431
00:41:35.923 --> 00:41:37.151
Let's hug it out.

432
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:39.111
- Hugs?
- What's he talking about?

433
00:41:39.226 --> 00:41:40.659
- Hugs.
- What?

434
00:41:42.362 --> 00:41:45.354
Stay away from the kid.
Stay away from the kid.

435
00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:47.193
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

436
00:42:23.637 --> 00:42:25.571
You have a lovely body, Owen.

437
00:42:29.009 --> 00:42:29.998
Fuck me.

438
00:42:31.712 --> 00:42:33.236
Do you work out?

439
00:42:36.883 --> 00:42:38.352
Can I ask you
where you got your underwear?

440
00:42:38.452 --> 00:42:40.283
Because they fit. They fit perfectly like...

441
00:42:40.887 --> 00:42:42.821
You guys are so fucking funny.

442
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.958
I'm asking you a serious question, that's all.

443
00:42:45.158 --> 00:42:46.489
These should all fit you.

444
00:42:46.627 --> 00:42:49.653
All I need is a T-shirt and some pants.

445
00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.161
Take it all.

446
00:42:51.798 --> 00:42:53.629
I don't need all this.

447
00:42:59.773 --> 00:43:02.298
She didn't have to give me all this.

448
00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:05.736
Just take it all, man.

449
00:43:07.981 --> 00:43:10.817
- I don't have to bring it back?
- Jesus. Are you listening? Take the clothes.

450
00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:13.511
- I was just fucking asking.
- Take them.

451
00:43:42.416 --> 00:43:44.748
Do you want to help your friend?

452
00:43:48.655 --> 00:43:50.213
Now it's his turn.

453
00:43:54.961 --> 00:43:57.293
- Stay strong, Private.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:02.960
Fuck!

455
00:44:05.772 --> 00:44:07.637
Don't give them anything!

456
00:44:08.375 --> 00:44:09.535
Private!

457
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:12.845
Your life depends on it!

458
00:44:12.979 --> 00:44:13.911
Please.

459
00:44:18.485 --> 00:44:22.421
Fuck! Motherfuckers!
I will fucking kill you!

460
00:44:24.024 --> 00:44:25.457
Christ!

461
00:44:26.526 --> 00:44:30.485
<i>My name is Private Joe Willis.
I'm with the United States Marine Corps.</i>

462
00:44:30.664 --> 00:44:33.963
I was told I was coming here
to fight for my country.

463
00:44:35.268 --> 00:44:39.170
But now I realize that Afghanistan
belongs to its people.

464
00:44:40.207 --> 00:44:42.573
<i>And we have no business being here.</i>

465
00:44:44.111 --> 00:44:45.840
<i>I love you, Cassie.</i>

466
00:44:47.748 --> 00:44:50.114
<i>Joe Jr., your daddy always loves you.</i>

467
00:44:55.789 --> 00:44:57.620
You have two daughters.

468
00:45:01.361 --> 00:45:03.329
Okay. Dad, get down.

469
00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:04.429
- How's this?
- Perfect.

470
00:45:04.598 --> 00:45:07.226
- Great. Great.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

471
00:45:39.332 --> 00:45:41.493
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

472
00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:43.527
Happy birthday!

473
00:45:44.838 --> 00:45:46.829
- You like the kitchen?
- I love it.

474
00:45:46.973 --> 00:45:48.497
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

475
00:45:48.642 --> 00:45:49.574
You're welcome.

476
00:45:50.076 --> 00:45:51.771
Mom, this is from Deedee.

477
00:45:51.912 --> 00:45:53.846
- Thank you, Deedee.
- You're welcome.

478
00:45:54.281 --> 00:45:56.647
- Can I help you open it?
- Yes, please.

479
00:45:57.918 --> 00:45:59.186
- She looking now?
- No, she's opening the presents.

480
00:45:59.286 --> 00:46:00.753
Good job on the kitchen.

481
00:46:01.388 --> 00:46:02.456
What did he just say to me?

482
00:46:02.556 --> 00:46:04.581
He said you did a good job on the kitchen.

483
00:46:05.025 --> 00:46:05.957
Okay. Go, go.

484
00:46:26.746 --> 00:46:29.010
Blow out the candles. Come on, come on.

485
00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:31.943
Do it.

486
00:46:38.391 --> 00:46:39.751
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

487
00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.420
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Thank you.

488
00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:49.567
Maggie? Maggie.

489
00:46:50.136 --> 00:46:51.660
- No!
- Maggie, slow down.

490
00:46:51.805 --> 00:46:53.568
Maggie, be careful.

491
00:46:57.711 --> 00:46:58.735
What are you doing?

492
00:46:58.879 --> 00:47:00.938
I want to get to the ice before my mama.

493
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:03.481
Well, you better wait for her,
don't you think?

494
00:47:04.184 --> 00:47:05.947
Everybody loves Maggie.

495
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.447
- Why do you say that?
- Because she's lovable.

496
00:47:17.964 --> 00:47:19.693
You know, your dad saved me

497
00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:22.301
in that water, right there,
when we were both kids.

498
00:47:24.771 --> 00:47:26.500
You know, you're like your dad.

499
00:47:27.207 --> 00:47:28.265
Am I?

500
00:47:32.445 --> 00:47:34.072
Am I like my mom?

501
00:47:36.116 --> 00:47:37.913
A spitting image, yeah.

502
00:47:39.586 --> 00:47:43.215
Except you're yourself, Isabelle.
And everybody loves you.

503
00:47:43.957 --> 00:47:45.151
Come on.

504
00:48:11.084 --> 00:48:12.312
I did it!

505
00:49:18.084 --> 00:49:20.484
I talked to her for over an hour.

506
00:49:22.288 --> 00:49:26.247
She said to me that she hadn't slept right
in over three years.

507
00:49:27.394 --> 00:49:31.592
She kept having these nightmares
that I would come back and shoot her.

508
00:49:35.468 --> 00:49:36.799
I don't know.

509
00:49:39.439 --> 00:49:42.465
I told her it was all right,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

510
00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.010
She just started to cry.

511
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:52.518
Right there in the bank,
she just started to cry.

512
00:49:57.223 --> 00:49:58.918
And she thanked me.

513
00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:05.758
She said that she felt like...

514
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.824
What did she say?

515
00:50:11.104 --> 00:50:13.072
Like she could breathe again.

516
00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:18.338
And then she asked
if I wanted to open up a bank account.

517
00:50:18.478 --> 00:50:19.410
No.

518
00:50:20.013 --> 00:50:21.241
I swear to God.

519
00:50:21.381 --> 00:50:23.440
- What did you do?
- I opened an account.

520
00:50:28.321 --> 00:50:29.879
I'm proud of you.

521
00:50:31.991 --> 00:50:34.425
I can't wait to start bouncing checks.

522
00:50:48.174 --> 00:50:52.907
When I was like 17 or 18,

523
00:50:59.919 --> 00:51:04.413
I used to listen to this song,
like, over and over again.

524
00:51:04.591 --> 00:51:05.785
Me, too.

525
00:51:08.428 --> 00:51:09.725
Really?

526
00:51:09.863 --> 00:51:11.797
Why is that so surprising?

527
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.200
I don't know. I just...

528
00:51:19.305 --> 00:51:21.773
I took you more for, like, an 'NSync fan.

529
00:51:21.941 --> 00:51:23.067
Fuck you.

530
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:25.143
Give me that.

531
00:51:25.778 --> 00:51:27.473
- Really?
- Really.

532
00:51:41.127 --> 00:51:43.152
You think I'm such a square.

533
00:51:43.997 --> 00:51:46.329
I'm starting to reassess, Snoop Dogg.

534
00:51:52.972 --> 00:51:55.497
Just because I was a cheerleader,
it doesn't...

535
00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:59.801
Yeah, and you dated a football player.

536
00:51:59.946 --> 00:52:01.607
I am such a cliché.

537
00:52:08.588 --> 00:52:10.869
You were kind of a pain in the ass.
You got to admit that.

538
00:52:11.024 --> 00:52:12.651
No, I wasn't.

539
00:52:13.526 --> 00:52:16.984
Guys always say that girls are stuck up
if they won't talk to them.

540
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.461
I just didn't like you.

541
00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:22.159
You were always drunk and fighting...

542
00:53:01.341 --> 00:53:03.502
I have to get some air.

543
00:54:53.086 --> 00:54:54.246
Captain!

544
00:54:56.255 --> 00:54:57.620
Captain!

545
00:55:39.599 --> 00:55:40.759
Take it.

546
00:56:01.454 --> 00:56:02.819
What do we do?

547
00:56:05.024 --> 00:56:07.015
He has no value for us.

548
00:56:09.429 --> 00:56:11.590
Just a weight on our shoulder.

549
00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.668
Waste of food and water.

550
00:56:18.905 --> 00:56:20.031
Kill him.

551
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.222
Pick it up.

552
00:56:44.764 --> 00:56:46.026
You have family?

553
00:56:48.901 --> 00:56:50.391
Do you want to see them again?

554
00:56:52.038 --> 00:56:53.903
Pick up the pipe!

555
00:56:59.879 --> 00:57:01.904
- Captain...
- It's you or him.

556
00:57:03.382 --> 00:57:05.179
Kill him or I will kill you.

557
00:57:06.986 --> 00:57:10.820
Kill him! Kill him or I will cut his head off!

558
00:57:11.057 --> 00:57:12.456
Kill him! Kill him!

559
00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:15.820
Kill him!

560
00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:18.788
Kill him!

561
00:58:15.087 --> 00:58:16.076
Shit.

562
00:58:28.501 --> 00:58:30.560
I brought you some molding.

563
00:58:46.752 --> 00:58:48.421
Hey, look,
I don't want to ruin anything, all right.

564
00:58:48.521 --> 00:58:51.581
I just want to be able to come over
and see the girls.

565
00:58:51.757 --> 00:58:54.555
Please, I would love
you to come see the girls.

566
00:58:59.565 --> 00:59:01.192
We just miss Sam.

567
00:59:03.769 --> 00:59:04.827
Yeah.

568
00:59:10.009 --> 00:59:11.374
That's Hank.

569
00:59:21.153 --> 00:59:22.916
You still at it, huh?

570
00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.388
Where did you ever learn to be so handy?

571
01:00:14.974 --> 01:00:16.066
Cover there!

572
01:00:20.112 --> 01:00:22.171
Move forward. Moving forward!

573
01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:23.611
Come on. Let's go.

574
01:00:27.119 --> 01:00:28.211
Straight ahead!

575
01:00:28.754 --> 01:00:30.256
- Stop right there!
- Get your hands up.

576
01:00:30.356 --> 01:00:32.085
Come to me. Come to me.

577
01:00:33.025 --> 01:00:34.617
Come on. Get your hands up.

578
01:00:35.294 --> 01:00:37.956
Get your hands up. Right here. Get down.

579
01:00:42.368 --> 01:00:43.699
You a Marine?

580
01:00:47.406 --> 01:00:49.374
Cahill, is that your name?

581
01:00:49.508 --> 01:00:51.442
Was there anyone else with you?

582
01:00:53.779 --> 01:00:55.371
- Come on. Ready?
- Come on.

583
01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:02.116
Get it on. Get it on.

584
01:01:02.822 --> 01:01:04.084
We need a nose.

585
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.715
- Mom, nose.
- Nose.

586
01:01:07.326 --> 01:01:08.623
- Nose!
- Here.

587
01:01:08.761 --> 01:01:10.956
Get the nose. Get the nose.

588
01:01:13.432 --> 01:01:15.297
He is looking hot, you guys.

589
01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:18.743
Can you teach them
how to throw snowballs?

590
01:01:18.871 --> 01:01:20.532
Because they can't even hit me.

591
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.536
That one hit you.

592
01:01:26.512 --> 01:01:29.037
Maybe I should hit you
with a massive snowball.

593
01:01:30.449 --> 01:01:31.643
Come on.

594
01:01:32.685 --> 01:01:33.982
Izzie, Izzie, are you okay?

595
01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.247
Izzie, Izzie. Hey, hey, hey.

596
01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:38.288
- Are you okay?
- Grace.

597
01:01:38.457 --> 01:01:40.891
Sucker! Sucker.

598
01:01:41.327 --> 01:01:42.589
Get him! Get him!

599
01:01:46.165 --> 01:01:47.598
Get him. Try and get him.

600
01:01:48.701 --> 01:01:49.725
Hello?

601
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:51.930
Yes, this is she.

602
01:01:53.472 --> 01:01:55.440
See this cheater-pants over here.

603
01:01:56.242 --> 01:01:57.903
Come on. You freaked me out.

604
01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:11.852
- What?
- Not me.

605
01:02:12.892 --> 01:02:15.087
It was him! Get up.

606
01:02:32.578 --> 01:02:34.443
Hey. What's going on?

607
01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:37.646
- Uncle Tommy, she grabbed my hair.
- Okay.

608
01:02:37.783 --> 01:02:39.910
I'm sorry. I want to keep playing.

609
01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:41.246
Okay. What?

610
01:02:57.369 --> 01:02:59.337
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

611
01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:02.929
- Why?
- Because we have to be patient. Okay?

612
01:03:05.878 --> 01:03:08.312
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

613
01:03:08.447 --> 01:03:09.573
Thanks.

614
01:03:18.424 --> 01:03:19.652
Daddy!

615
01:03:21.026 --> 01:03:23.893
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

616
01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:26.494
My babies.

617
01:03:59.098 --> 01:04:00.759
I love you, honey.

618
01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.407
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Sure.

619
01:04:20.986 --> 01:04:22.578
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

620
01:04:23.289 --> 01:04:25.450
Do you like it? Do you like it?

621
01:04:25.624 --> 01:04:28.422
Wow. It's amazing.

622
01:04:29.295 --> 01:04:30.421
I think he likes it.

623
01:04:31.664 --> 01:04:33.154
- Who did it?
- Me.

624
01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:35.391
- You did?
- And Uncle Tommy.

625
01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:37.660
Uncle Tommy and 'three amigos'.

626
01:05:04.296 --> 01:05:05.957
Are you tired, honey?

627
01:05:07.433 --> 01:05:09.492
Come, get in bed. Everyone.

628
01:05:11.103 --> 01:05:12.536
This is fun.

629
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.900
- I missed you, Daddy.
- Me, too.

630
01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:19.072
My girls.

631
01:05:20.913 --> 01:05:22.278
That's us, all right.

632
01:05:33.859 --> 01:05:35.417
Can I get up, Mom?

633
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:38.826
Dad, it's not bedtime.

634
01:05:53.212 --> 01:05:54.873
I locked that door.

635
01:05:56.448 --> 01:05:57.813
It's broken.

636
01:06:16.535 --> 01:06:18.730
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

637
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.468
- Banged up well, huh?
- Yeah.

638
01:06:55.908 --> 01:06:58.638
Can't you take that down to the mechanic?

639
01:07:00.946 --> 01:07:02.174
I got it.

640
01:07:03.382 --> 01:07:05.009
Nothing else to do.

641
01:07:07.986 --> 01:07:09.180
You okay?

642
01:07:10.956 --> 01:07:11.980
Yeah.

643
01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:24.193
'Cause after I got back from Nam,
I couldn't talk to your mother.

644
01:07:26.772 --> 01:07:31.209
I guess I took it out on you and Tommy,
you know, I...

645
01:07:32.077 --> 01:07:33.601
I don't know why.

646
01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:41.241
Look, if you ever wanna talk, let me know.
All right?

647
01:08:06.411 --> 01:08:07.503
You okay?

648
01:08:11.517 --> 01:08:12.848
You're good.

649
01:08:14.353 --> 01:08:16.412
Better than I thought, yeah.

650
01:08:17.923 --> 01:08:20.391
You look good out there with them.

651
01:08:29.668 --> 01:08:31.898
Thanks for taking care of them.

652
01:08:32.771 --> 01:08:34.136
I didn't expect that.

653
01:08:34.273 --> 01:08:36.639
It just comes naturally, you know.

654
01:08:41.947 --> 01:08:44.472
It makes me start to think, you know.

655
01:08:52.658 --> 01:08:54.558
Grace is something, huh?

656
01:08:58.497 --> 01:09:00.021
Did you fuck her?

657
01:09:03.302 --> 01:09:04.022
What? You kidding?

658
01:09:06.705 --> 01:09:08.172
I'd understand.

659
01:09:10.642 --> 01:09:13.008
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

660
01:09:14.646 --> 01:09:15.908
Tommy,

661
01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:18.643
I could forgive you.

662
01:09:29.228 --> 01:09:31.321
What's going on in your head?

663
01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:35.092
What's making you think that?

664
01:09:39.338 --> 01:09:43.900
You guys just look like
two teenagers in love out there.

665
01:09:45.677 --> 01:09:46.939
All right.

666
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.775
I mean, you know?

667
01:09:51.016 --> 01:09:52.711
You can't deny that.

668
01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.124
You can tell me.

669
01:10:11.803 --> 01:10:13.668
You gotta tell me. You understand?

670
01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:16.970
- I know you slept in my house.
- Sam. Sam...

671
01:10:17.109 --> 01:10:20.044
Hey, don't bullshit me.

672
01:10:37.162 --> 01:10:38.857
Joe Jr., come back.

673
01:10:40.699 --> 01:10:42.291
Cassie, he's fine.

674
01:10:44.202 --> 01:10:47.694
Ever since his dad died,
I can't let him out of my sight.

675
01:10:48.807 --> 01:10:51.469
Look at him. He's got a mind of his own.

676
01:10:52.477 --> 01:10:56.538
I have this nightmare
where Joe is looking up at me,

677
01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.717
and he's trying to tell me something.

678
01:10:58.817 --> 01:11:01.615
He's trying to talk to me, but the teeth,

679
01:11:01.753 --> 01:11:05.621
his teeth just fall out of his mouth
and there is blood,

680
01:11:07.826 --> 01:11:11.159
and I'm scrabbling around picking them up.

681
01:11:12.431 --> 01:11:15.798
And then last night,
your husband was there.

682
01:11:17.235 --> 01:11:18.971
And he looks at my hand,
and he takes my hand,

683
01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:21.505
and he looks at my wedding ring
and he just smiles at me.

684
01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.906
- Did he say anything?
- No. He just smiled.

685
01:11:30.716 --> 01:11:33.480
In the dream, I hated him for being alive.

686
01:11:35.087 --> 01:11:38.113
That's why I came over to apologize.
I'm sorry.

687
01:11:39.524 --> 01:11:43.620
I'm sick of feeling like this all the time.
I want to forgive them.

688
01:11:43.795 --> 01:11:46.161
I want to be able to forgive them.

689
01:11:51.203 --> 01:11:52.534
Poor Joe Jr.

690
01:11:54.106 --> 01:11:55.232
He knows.

691
01:11:56.441 --> 01:12:00.172
He's just like his daddy.
He knows exactly what I'm thinking.

692
01:12:06.184 --> 01:12:08.084
Where are you going, huh?

693
01:12:11.523 --> 01:12:13.047
- Sam.
- Hi.

694
01:12:15.227 --> 01:12:16.956
Did you see him die?

695
01:12:20.932 --> 01:12:21.864
No.

696
01:12:22.934 --> 01:12:24.731
Did you hear anything?

697
01:12:25.704 --> 01:12:27.672
I mean, was he on his own?

698
01:12:29.374 --> 01:12:31.501
He was brave. I know that.

699
01:12:34.346 --> 01:12:36.177
That's Captain Cahill.

700
01:12:37.115 --> 01:12:39.515
He was friends with your daddy.

701
01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:42.984
Wave. Are you gonna wave?
Are you gonna wave?

702
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:46.548
You're a good man.

703
01:12:47.626 --> 01:12:50.220
Baby, where are you going? Come here.

704
01:14:22.621 --> 01:14:25.454
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Send him in.

705
01:14:26.858 --> 01:14:28.689
I want to go back, sir.

706
01:14:29.794 --> 01:14:31.921
I'm ready. Need to see my men.

707
01:14:33.098 --> 01:14:35.123
How's the counseling going?

708
01:14:35.567 --> 01:14:37.296
Yeah. I saw Thompson.

709
01:14:38.537 --> 01:14:43.736
Everything pretty good there
and, you know, just thinking about my men

710
01:14:43.875 --> 01:14:46.901
and want to get back.

711
01:14:47.045 --> 01:14:48.342
That's good.

712
01:14:49.814 --> 01:14:51.441
How's the family?

713
01:14:55.053 --> 01:14:56.884
I can't be there, sir.

714
01:14:57.422 --> 01:14:58.446
Yeah?

715
01:15:00.492 --> 01:15:02.289
They don't understand.

716
01:15:04.796 --> 01:15:07.287
You know, I mean, nobody understands.

717
01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:11.835
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.

718
01:15:12.837 --> 01:15:14.702
You've been through a lot of shit.

719
01:15:16.241 --> 01:15:18.141
So has your family.

720
01:15:18.276 --> 01:15:19.937
I don't mind Brian.

721
01:15:21.046 --> 01:15:24.812
He never hits people,
only the boys, but not the girls.

722
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:26.645
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

723
01:15:27.252 --> 01:15:31.655
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name, though.

724
01:15:31.823 --> 01:15:33.017
Elephant?

725
01:15:37.562 --> 01:15:39.291
An elephant's not a dog.

726
01:15:39.698 --> 01:15:41.893
I know an elephant's not a dog.

727
01:15:42.033 --> 01:15:43.295
Then why did you say it?

728
01:15:43.435 --> 01:15:47.701
Because elephants have big ears
and so does his dog.

729
01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:53.334
So, big ears, get it?

730
01:15:53.812 --> 01:15:56.474
It's really funny if you think about it, Dad.

731
01:15:56.715 --> 01:15:57.773
Sam, relax.

732
01:15:57.916 --> 01:15:59.611
But how is it funny?

733
01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:01.879
Big ears.

734
01:16:16.768 --> 01:16:21.831
- Is Dad okay, Mom?
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

735
01:16:23.608 --> 01:16:25.235
When is Uncle Tommy coming?

736
01:16:25.377 --> 01:16:27.242
- He's coming soon, sweetie, okay?
- Okay.

737
01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:29.347
He wants to play with you.

738
01:16:30.548 --> 01:16:31.879
- Okay?
- Okay.

739
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:35.510
- I'm gonna go check on Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

740
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.529
Sammy, what happened?

741
01:16:51.836 --> 01:16:53.394
What's going on?

742
01:16:54.472 --> 01:16:55.803
Talk to me.

743
01:16:57.642 --> 01:16:59.075
What happened?

744
01:17:00.712 --> 01:17:02.612
What did they do to you?

745
01:17:04.649 --> 01:17:06.947
What happened with you and Tommy?

746
01:17:20.565 --> 01:17:22.294
We kissed. That's it.

747
01:17:25.203 --> 01:17:26.602
I missed you.

748
01:17:27.772 --> 01:17:29.672
I thought you were dead.

749
01:17:31.209 --> 01:17:33.177
I couldn't get out of bed.

750
01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.377
That's it.

751
01:17:44.589 --> 01:17:48.150
- You told me the truth?
- You know.

752
01:17:53.965 --> 01:17:55.296
Now tell me.

753
01:18:13.885 --> 01:18:16.012
I think you're fucking Tommy.

754
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:17.947
Sam...

755
01:19:05.904 --> 01:19:08.600
Come on, come on. Faster. Faster.

756
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.600
Why did you stop pulling?

757
01:19:16.181 --> 01:19:17.170
Hey.

758
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:20.742
You girls playing?

759
01:19:25.757 --> 01:19:27.190
What's wrong?

760
01:19:33.932 --> 01:19:35.194
It's okay.

761
01:19:40.138 --> 01:19:41.833
I was just confused.

762
01:19:45.076 --> 01:19:46.737
It's gonna be okay.

763
01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:50.875
Come here. Give me a hug.

764
01:19:52.116 --> 01:19:55.813
Now. Those are my girls.

765
01:20:03.928 --> 01:20:07.329
Why did the girl blush
when she opened the refrigerator?

766
01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:10.990
- She saw the salad dressing.
- She saw the salad dressing.

767
01:20:11.536 --> 01:20:12.901
I told you guys that one?

768
01:20:14.272 --> 01:20:15.864
A thousand times.

769
01:20:16.007 --> 01:20:17.941
It's still funny, though.

770
01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:23.714
Have fun.

771
01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:51.169
Where have you been?

772
01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:55.308
I was outside

773
01:20:56.447 --> 01:21:02.909
just thinking and...

774
01:21:10.428 --> 01:21:13.886
I was just thinking about you and the kids

775
01:21:14.065 --> 01:21:18.934
and the sun came up and I thought,

776
01:21:20.905 --> 01:21:22.839
I'm so lucky to be alive.

777
01:21:43.995 --> 01:21:46.793
We're gonna be late. Come on.

778
01:21:46.931 --> 01:21:48.364
Do you have a spelling test today?

779
01:21:48.499 --> 01:21:52.333
Come on, Grandpa. It's my birthday.
It's my birthday!

780
01:21:57.275 --> 01:22:00.142
Can I open my presents now? Please.

781
01:22:00.278 --> 01:22:01.870
I think we should wait.

782
01:22:02.013 --> 01:22:03.037
Wait for Uncle Tommy.

783
01:22:03.181 --> 01:22:07.811
- Pretty please.
- Well, let her open just one. It won't hurt.

784
01:22:08.419 --> 01:22:11.547
- You can open Grandpa's.
- Thank you.

785
01:22:11.723 --> 01:22:12.985
Just one.

786
01:22:13.157 --> 01:22:15.421
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

787
01:22:15.593 --> 01:22:17.151
Is it the big one?

788
01:22:18.129 --> 01:22:19.153
It's Uncle Tommy!

789
01:22:19.330 --> 01:22:20.354
Let's guess.

790
01:22:26.971 --> 01:22:27.995
Izzie.

791
01:22:28.139 --> 01:22:29.436
- Hey.
- Hey.

792
01:22:32.143 --> 01:22:33.735
What's the matter?

793
01:22:35.079 --> 01:22:36.603
Is she okay?

794
01:22:37.382 --> 01:22:40.215
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Tina.

795
01:22:40.351 --> 01:22:41.750
- I'm Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

796
01:22:41.886 --> 01:22:43.821
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

797
01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:46.048
We're all in the dining room.

798
01:22:48.192 --> 01:22:50.683
Oh, my God. She's so pretty.

799
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:01.795
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

800
01:23:02.607 --> 01:23:04.040
This is Tina.

801
01:23:05.843 --> 01:23:07.572
She's an old friend.

802
01:23:08.546 --> 01:23:11.572
Actually, we just met an hour ago.

803
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:15.041
Yeah. It was like an hour and a half.

804
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.281
You got quite a charmer here.

805
01:23:19.724 --> 01:23:22.852
It hides inside its shell

806
01:23:23.027 --> 01:23:27.589
putting its head in the shell
and its arms and legs

807
01:23:28.566 --> 01:23:30.500
and its little tiny tail.

808
01:23:31.069 --> 01:23:34.630
And when the thing that's scaring him
goes like this,

809
01:23:35.773 --> 01:23:37.638
the turtle doesn't come out.

810
01:23:37.775 --> 01:23:42.906
So, the thing that scares the turtle
goes away

811
01:23:43.047 --> 01:23:44.810
'cause it thinks it's a rock.

812
01:23:44.949 --> 01:23:46.746
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy birthday.

813
01:23:46.884 --> 01:23:48.283
Yes, you are.

814
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:53.749
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

815
01:23:53.925 --> 01:23:55.415
Everyone's different, Dad, you know.

816
01:23:55.593 --> 01:23:57.618
- Stop playing with your cake.
- What do you mean?

817
01:23:57.795 --> 01:24:03.062
I just think it's necessary that
everybody has someone to listen to them.

818
01:24:03.201 --> 01:24:07.695
Right, you know, these days
they need therapy if they stub their toe.

819
01:24:08.339 --> 01:24:11.331
These guys are Marines.
They're trained for it.

820
01:24:12.143 --> 01:24:15.340
They're Marines, but they're still people,

821
01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.385
and I don't think that anybody is trained
to shoot somebody.

822
01:24:21.519 --> 01:24:22.720
What do you think they are trained for?

823
01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:27.814
I think that they're... What?
They're trained to use deadly force...

824
01:24:28.259 --> 01:24:30.294
- Trained to kill.
- ...but nobody can really be trained

825
01:24:30.394 --> 01:24:31.759
to watch someone die.

826
01:24:31.896 --> 01:24:35.593
That's just something
that you're not taught.

827
01:24:35.733 --> 01:24:36.722
Hey.

828
01:24:39.837 --> 01:24:43.773
Isabelle, let it go.

829
01:24:43.908 --> 01:24:45.739
Please. Thank you.

830
01:24:46.744 --> 01:24:48.405
So, what do you do?

831
01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:52.074
- I'm going to be a nurse.
- Hey!

832
01:24:52.216 --> 01:24:55.185
- I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

833
01:24:55.319 --> 01:24:57.116
- Dad?
- Isabelle.

834
01:24:58.389 --> 01:24:59.913
That's my kitty.

835
01:25:00.091 --> 01:25:02.491
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a nurse, sir.

836
01:25:03.194 --> 01:25:05.628
- Need a nurse?
- Let you know if I do.

837
01:25:05.763 --> 01:25:07.594
Maggie gets everything.

838
01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:11.300
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

839
01:25:11.435 --> 01:25:14.563
I didn't get anything that I wanted
on my birthday.

840
01:25:15.973 --> 01:25:18.407
And you were in stupid Afghanistan.

841
01:25:23.748 --> 01:25:26.216
Nursing. How's nursing been for you, Tina?

842
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:28.147
It's been a challenge.

843
01:25:28.653 --> 01:25:32.214
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

844
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:34.952
Where did you grow up, Tina?

845
01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.961
Just 20 miles south.
Actually, I've never really left.

846
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:41.758
So... I'm gonna change that, though.

847
01:25:42.133 --> 01:25:43.930
I'm living at home right now which...

848
01:25:44.068 --> 01:25:47.504
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time,

849
01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.803
which is good, it helps me save money
for school and stuff.

850
01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:55.276
- RN?
- An RN, yeah.

851
01:25:56.747 --> 01:25:59.409
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

852
01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:01.652
Isabelle, we're trying to listen
to our guest, all right?

853
01:26:01.752 --> 01:26:03.777
So you're in eight-hour shifts, 12-hour...

854
01:26:03.921 --> 01:26:08.756
Now I am praying for 12-hour shifts.
I have to get...

855
01:26:08.893 --> 01:26:11.726
Student loans are killing me.

856
01:26:12.230 --> 01:26:14.460
I don't know how anyone does it.
How did you do it?

857
01:26:14.599 --> 01:26:15.793
Isabelle.

858
01:26:19.971 --> 01:26:21.029
Stop it.

859
01:26:21.172 --> 01:26:22.935
What got you into it?

860
01:26:23.441 --> 01:26:27.468
I genuinely like people and I love...

861
01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:29.871
I might as well like it.

862
01:26:30.047 --> 01:26:31.139
Enough!

863
01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:35.311
Couldn't you just stay dead?

864
01:26:35.453 --> 01:26:36.420
Isabelle!

865
01:26:36.554 --> 01:26:39.489
You're just mad 'cause Mom would rather
sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

866
01:26:39.657 --> 01:26:41.557
Isabelle! Why would you say that?

867
01:26:41.692 --> 01:26:43.990
Mom and Uncle Tommy had sex all the time.

868
01:26:44.128 --> 01:26:45.254
Enough!

869
01:27:12.023 --> 01:27:13.615
Can I go home now?

870
01:27:14.925 --> 01:27:16.517
I wanna go to bed.

871
01:27:36.647 --> 01:27:37.978
Sorry, Mom.

872
01:27:44.822 --> 01:27:47.689
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

873
01:27:50.995 --> 01:27:52.553
I don't like Dad.

874
01:27:55.099 --> 01:27:59.331
I'd rather have Uncle Tommy around
instead of Dad.

875
01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:02.131
Me, too.

876
01:28:06.043 --> 01:28:08.204
Daddy's gonna be better, okay?

877
01:28:09.613 --> 01:28:11.774
- Really?
- Yeah.

878
01:28:14.552 --> 01:28:15.883
Thanks, Mom.

879
01:28:19.457 --> 01:28:23.018
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

880
01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:51.149
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

881
01:28:54.558 --> 01:28:56.219
Where are you going?

882
01:28:58.896 --> 01:29:00.887
It's none of your damn business, you know.

883
01:29:03.367 --> 01:29:05.562
Just stay the hell out of it.

884
01:29:06.971 --> 01:29:09.030
You gotta call the police, Hank.

885
01:29:20.684 --> 01:29:22.117
What is that?

886
01:29:26.123 --> 01:29:28.717
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

887
01:29:32.129 --> 01:29:34.063
- They all tucked in?
- Yeah.

888
01:29:36.133 --> 01:29:37.725
Say their prayers?

889
01:29:40.871 --> 01:29:41.803
Good.

890
01:29:46.811 --> 01:29:47.835
Sam?

891
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.469
Sam?

892
01:29:52.883 --> 01:29:55.317
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

893
01:30:16.340 --> 01:30:20.640
- You know what I did to get back to you?
- No.

894
01:30:20.778 --> 01:30:24.236
You know what I did
to fucking get back to you?

895
01:30:24.748 --> 01:30:26.807
You fucking bitch!

896
01:30:29.019 --> 01:30:31.351
You know how he fucking suffered?

897
01:30:31.489 --> 01:30:33.821
He fucking suffered because of you!

898
01:30:33.991 --> 01:30:38.394
And what have you done to my
fucking house and my fucking kids, Grace?

899
01:30:38.562 --> 01:30:40.894
- You're fucking my brother.
- Sam, you know I didn't.

900
01:30:41.131 --> 01:30:43.895
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

901
01:30:44.034 --> 01:30:45.797
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

902
01:30:45.936 --> 01:30:48.905
- Please, our girls, please.
- You know how much I love you?

903
01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.209
You know what I...
Grace, do you know what I fucking...

904
01:30:55.079 --> 01:30:58.981
You know what I had to do
with these fucking hands, Grace?

905
01:30:59.416 --> 01:31:01.316
You... Fuck!

906
01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:06.750
God, fuck!

907
01:31:10.895 --> 01:31:12.795
What are you doing here?

908
01:31:28.345 --> 01:31:29.573
Come on, man.

909
01:31:45.729 --> 01:31:49.961
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
- What are you fucking doing?

910
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:51.192
Go to your room.

911
01:31:51.335 --> 01:31:53.360
- Fuck. What are you doing, Tommy?
- Okay.

912
01:31:53.504 --> 01:31:56.200
- What the fuck are you doing to me?
- Girls, lock the door.

913
01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:58.240
Behind my fucking back!

914
01:32:00.144 --> 01:32:02.044
- Did you call the cops?
- Hold on.

915
01:32:02.179 --> 01:32:04.943
- Did you call the fucking cops?
- All right. All right. All right.

916
01:32:18.929 --> 01:32:20.794
Is there a disturbance?

917
01:32:24.501 --> 01:32:25.900
Hold back.

918
01:32:26.036 --> 01:32:27.298
What are you doing here?

919
01:32:27.438 --> 01:32:28.973
- Drop your weapon.
- What are you doing?

920
01:32:29.073 --> 01:32:31.871
- Hold on. Put your gun down.
- Tommy, go back in the house.

921
01:32:32.009 --> 01:32:35.206
- What are you doing, huh?
- Put your weapon down, Captain.

922
01:32:35.346 --> 01:32:36.278
You know me?

923
01:32:36.413 --> 01:32:37.715
- Just shut up for a second, okay?
- You know me, huh?

924
01:32:37.815 --> 01:32:40.010
- I know your father, sir.
- Stay back!

925
01:32:40.150 --> 01:32:42.380
- Stay back!
- All right. All right. All right.

926
01:32:42.519 --> 01:32:45.010
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero!

927
01:32:45.155 --> 01:32:47.623
I'm no fucking hero!
You know what I've done?

928
01:32:47.791 --> 01:32:50.089
- Hey, it's all right. Sam!
- Just relax.

929
01:32:50.227 --> 01:32:51.427
- Sam!
- Put the gun down, Sam.

930
01:32:51.528 --> 01:32:53.519
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

931
01:32:53.697 --> 01:32:54.994
You gonna shoot me?

932
01:32:55.132 --> 01:32:56.360
- Put the gun down!
- Sam!

933
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.264
- Fucking shoot me! Shoot me!
- Hold your fire. Nobody shoot!

934
01:32:59.403 --> 01:33:00.927
Shoot me! Come on!

935
01:33:01.071 --> 01:33:04.905
Jesus, shut the fuck up!
This is a family matter. Shut up!

936
01:33:05.042 --> 01:33:06.441
Shut up. He's my brother.

937
01:33:06.577 --> 01:33:08.178
- Just stop for a second.
- Put the gun down, sir.

938
01:33:08.278 --> 01:33:11.270
- Just let me talk to him. He's my brother.
- Give him a minute.

939
01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.152
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

940
01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:22.114
Sam!

941
01:33:31.702 --> 01:33:35.900
You're my brother. You're my family.

942
01:33:40.244 --> 01:33:41.711
Do you hear me?

943
01:33:44.348 --> 01:33:45.542
Sam!

944
01:34:03.367 --> 01:34:05.164
What's going on, Sam?

945
01:34:07.304 --> 01:34:08.999
I'm drowning, Tommy.

946
01:34:15.412 --> 01:34:17.437
Go. Go, go. Get on the ground!

947
01:34:17.881 --> 01:34:19.683
- Gun clear. Get down.
- Get on the ground now!

948
01:34:19.783 --> 01:34:20.977
Get down!

949
01:34:21.118 --> 01:34:23.086
- Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

950
01:34:25.723 --> 01:34:27.884
On your knees. On your knees.

951
01:34:30.594 --> 01:34:31.891
Get him up.

952
01:36:11.495 --> 01:36:13.087
<i>My darling Grace,</i>

953
01:36:15.032 --> 01:36:19.401
<i>if you're reading this,
it means I didn't make it back.</i>

954
01:36:21.605 --> 01:36:23.869
<i>Nothing is certain in this life.</i>

955
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:31.147
<i>The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you and our girls.</i>

956
01:36:33.517 --> 01:36:35.644
<i>That is the only thing I know.</i>

957
01:36:45.128 --> 01:36:49.030
- Hello?
- Hey, Tommy. It's Sam.

958
01:36:49.666 --> 01:36:50.690
Hey.

959
01:36:55.372 --> 01:37:00.776
I was just thinking about you.

960
01:37:01.879 --> 01:37:04.905
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

961
01:37:05.916 --> 01:37:09.079
Just calling. Yeah.

962
01:37:13.724 --> 01:37:15.658
You're my brother, Tommy.

963
01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:32.408
When is your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

964
01:37:55.365 --> 01:37:58.698
Okay, sir. You know the drill.
We'll see you in about 30 minutes.

965
01:38:31.802 --> 01:38:33.531
Sam, tell me what happened.

966
01:38:41.745 --> 01:38:46.045
Sam, what happened?

967
01:38:49.853 --> 01:38:52.117
Why are you punishing yourself?

968
01:39:07.137 --> 01:39:09.799
I've loved you since I was 16 years old.

969
01:39:10.807 --> 01:39:12.240
You know that?

970
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:16.702
If you don't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

971
01:39:41.738 --> 01:39:43.137
I killed him.

972
01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:52.175
I killed Joe Willis.

973
01:40:05.529 --> 01:40:09.431
<i>I don't know who said,
"Only the dead have seen the end of war."</i>

974
01:40:11.835 --> 01:40:13.860
<i>I have seen the end of war.</i>

975
01:40:16.573 --> 01:40:22.034
<i>The question is, can I live again?</i>
