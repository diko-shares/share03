00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.359
October 7, 2007.

2
00:01:15.437 --> 00:01:17.371
Four days till we deploy.

3
00:01:18.673 --> 00:01:21.665
Grace knows I would do
anything to get back to her.

4
00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:23.571
Anything.

5
00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:28.239
Today I wrote her a letter.

6
00:01:39.894 --> 00:01:43.523
Good afternoon, sir. I have the briefing
papers from the colonel's office.

7
00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:45.394
Put them on the desk.

8
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:51.133
Thank you, Corporal.

9
00:01:57.746 --> 00:01:59.543
Major. Hey.

10
00:02:00.982 --> 00:02:02.882
Hope you don't have to deliver it.

11
00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:05.576
Copy that.

12
00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:07.716
- Be safe out there, Sam.
- Thanks, sir.

13
00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.086
- See you when you get back.
- All right.

14
00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:19.496
How's this?

15
00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:20.692
Warm.

16
00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.970
- Hello.
- Dad!

17
00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:28.166
Hey! Hey, baby.

18
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.470
- Hi, Daddy.
- How you doing?

19
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:31.272
- How was school?
- Great.

20
00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:35.475
They gave me Noodles the
dog. She's in my room.

21
00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:38.415
Izzie?

22
00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:41.285
Hey.

23
00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:44.318
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.994
What's wrong, honey?

25
00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:48.857
You're leaving again.

26
00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:51.459
Come give your daddy a hug.

27
00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:53.099
No.

28
00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.000
Come on. Give me a kiss, honey.

29
00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.297
Just go.

30
00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:00.204
- Two kisses?
- No.

31
00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:02.575
Three kisses?

32
00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.109
I wanna read my book.

33
00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:07.180
You wanna read your book?

34
00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:10.045
Oh, yeah?

35
00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:17.024
I see a smile coming. There it is! There
it is! Now, you're getting 100 kisses!

36
00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:20.593
- Behind you! Right behind you!
- What? What? What? Who? Who?

37
00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:25.765
Wait a second! Two against
one. That is no fair!

38
00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:27.424
Daddy, put me down!

39
00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.501
Girls.

40
00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:32.532
- Come on. Daddy's gotta go.
- Okay.

41
00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:36.110
Please stay. Please let him stay.

42
00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:39.805
- Yeah. Can't you stay?
- It's my brother.

43
00:03:39.948 --> 00:03:41.779
He doesn't deserve you.

44
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:45.512
Go rob another bank, Tommy!

45
00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:48.285
Bring that money back to me, brother!

46
00:03:57.432 --> 00:03:58.865
See you later.

47
00:04:23.124 --> 00:04:25.183
What happened to my little brother?

48
00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:37.666
No fucking way.

49
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:02.991
You ever think of
apologizing to that woman?

50
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.962
It's green.

51
00:05:07.802 --> 00:05:08.996
I got it.

52
00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.340
So, what are you gonna do?

53
00:05:23.485 --> 00:05:28.787
I don't know. I'm just gonna cash
this check, and then who knows.

54
00:05:29.324 --> 00:05:31.087
- I'll see you later?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

55
00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.819
- Don't rob the place.
- Yeah. Get the fuck out of here.

56
00:05:48.743 --> 00:05:50.643
No hot water in this place?

57
00:05:52.547 --> 00:05:54.447
Fucking hot water is missing.

58
00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:03.449
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:05.752
How do you stand this kitchen?

60
00:06:06.327 --> 00:06:08.761
He didn't expect to be
deploying again so soon.

61
00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:10.626
Yeah. Well, are you
ripping your hair out?

62
00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:13.063
What are you gonna do?
They call, you answer.

63
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:14.793
- Don't tell her. Oh, no.
- Yes!

64
00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:16.836
- I won.
- She got you, Granddad.

65
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.871
You're raising a real
hustler here, Grace.

66
00:06:19.007 --> 00:06:20.338
I know.

67
00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:27.040
My birthday's this spring.

68
00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:29.615
It is, isn't it? What is it,
March 10th, something like that?

69
00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:35.847
- Hi.
- Hi.

70
00:06:36.024 --> 00:06:38.549
- Are you Isabelle?
- No, I'm Maggie.

71
00:06:38.726 --> 00:06:40.216
Isabelle's big.

72
00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:42.986
I'm Tommy.

73
00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:44.654
Mom doesn't like you.

74
00:06:44.832 --> 00:06:45.924
Maggie!

75
00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:48.433
What? That's what you said to Dad.

76
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:51.502
These are for your mom.

77
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:54.531
Mom, they're for you.

78
00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:55.938
Thank you.

79
00:06:56.711 --> 00:06:57.871
Come in.

80
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:02.112
- Hey. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

81
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.774
Come here.

82
00:07:04.752 --> 00:07:05.776
Hi.

83
00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:07.553
You made it.

84
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.879
Yeah.

85
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.723
- Son.
- Sir.

86
00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.594
- What? Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:23.602
Bless us, O Lord, in these thy
gifts which we are about to receive

88
00:07:23.738 --> 00:07:25.672
from thy bounty through
Christ, our Lord. Amen.

89
00:07:25.807 --> 00:07:27.035
- Amen.
- Amen.

90
00:07:27.175 --> 00:07:31.544
And this is a very special meal for us
because we are welcoming one son home,

91
00:07:31.679 --> 00:07:34.546
and we're sending another one off.

92
00:07:34.682 --> 00:07:38.948
And we ask you, Lord, to keep him safe
and bring him back really soon. Right?

93
00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:40.076
- Yeah.
- Amen.

94
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.552
- Amen.
- Amen.

95
00:07:42.223 --> 00:07:43.713
Here. You can do it.

96
00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:45.654
- You wanna try?
- Thank you, Mom.

97
00:07:45.827 --> 00:07:48.261
- Here, let me.
- Thanks, Mama.

98
00:07:50.064 --> 00:07:51.326
Carrots are delicious.

99
00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:01.866
- Why aren't you eating your peas?
- I hate peas.

100
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:04.773
I do, too.

101
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.805
Honey, eat your peas.

102
00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:08.881
Okay, Dad.

103
00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:10.348
I like peas.

104
00:08:11.185 --> 00:08:12.618
So do I.

105
00:08:12.754 --> 00:08:14.984
- When are you leaving?
- Tuesday.

106
00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:20.317
You love it over there, huh?

107
00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:23.294
It's my job.

108
00:08:23.431 --> 00:08:25.558
They only shoot the bad guys.

109
00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.896
Who are the bad guys?

110
00:08:30.138 --> 00:08:31.605
The ones with the beards.

111
00:08:35.476 --> 00:08:37.341
Your brother's a hero.

112
00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:41.371
He's serving his country, and
don't you ever forget that.

113
00:08:44.085 --> 00:08:46.417
Will you be here for my birthday?

114
00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:49.189
You know I will, sweetie.

115
00:08:50.825 --> 00:08:52.588
Sarah Miller's dad wasn't
there for her birthday.

116
00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:55.326
- Isabelle.
- It's true.

117
00:08:55.463 --> 00:08:58.023
She had to bring him a cake in prison.

118
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.632
It's not just military families.

119
00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:04.363
There's a lot of folks
under pressure these days.

120
00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:08.069
They got problems in all walks of life.

121
00:09:09.544 --> 00:09:12.411
Every family's got their
own set of problems.

122
00:09:15.016 --> 00:09:16.415
They sure do.

123
00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:22.415
What is that supposed to mean?

124
00:09:26.427 --> 00:09:28.952
Every family has their
own set of problems.

125
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.360
You sound like a damn parrot.

126
00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:32.761
Like a what?

127
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.664
Why don't you try mimicking
your brother for a change?

128
00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:37.031
Dad.

129
00:09:38.673 --> 00:09:41.198
This food is great, Elsie. Thank you.

130
00:09:43.077 --> 00:09:44.635
Compared to what?

131
00:09:49.717 --> 00:09:51.082
Other food.

132
00:09:51.219 --> 00:09:52.743
Prison food?

133
00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:53.979
Tommy!

134
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:01.823
Excuse me.

135
00:10:07.034 --> 00:10:08.160
It's okay, honey.

136
00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:10.395
- No. No.
- It's his first night out.

137
00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:14.804
He comes waltzing in here with
no regard for anybody else.

138
00:10:14.942 --> 00:10:17.001
Doesn't even bother to apologize...

139
00:10:32.326 --> 00:10:33.987
Stay out of trouble.

140
00:10:36.664 --> 00:10:37.926
All right.

141
00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:44.903
You be safe over there. All right?

142
00:10:57.485 --> 00:10:59.180
This thing's not coming off.

143
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:02.715
- Try more soap.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:04.323
Almost got it.

145
00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:10.096
There we go.

146
00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:14.994
- Don't lose that.
- I'll do my best.

147
00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:16.330
Okay.

148
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:22.171
- Take a lot of pictures when I'm gone.
- I always do.

149
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:28.178
I love you.

150
00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:30.540
I love you, too.

151
00:12:00.147 --> 00:12:01.205
Sam?

152
00:12:03.451 --> 00:12:05.009
Take me with you.

153
00:12:06.721 --> 00:12:07.745
Sure.

154
00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:14.590
How about I go and
you stay with the kids?

155
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:18.357
Okay.

156
00:12:22.503 --> 00:12:23.936
Don't go.

157
00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:31.973
October 12, 2007.

158
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.280
Back in Afghanistan with my men.

159
00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:41.953
Weird. It almost feels like home.

160
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.490
Hi, Cassie. Joe Jr. is so big.

161
00:13:44.752 --> 00:13:46.219
What's the distance to the LZ?

162
00:13:46.354 --> 00:13:49.380
We're three minutes out.
Clear to detach to the LZ.

163
00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:50.581
Roger that.

164
00:13:57.598 --> 00:14:00.032
Clear to engage. Weapons hot.

165
00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:03.531
Target took cover in the valley.

166
00:14:03.671 --> 00:14:04.865
Little bastards...

167
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.900
Who is it?

168
00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:47.105
It's Captain Sanderson
and Chaplain Davis.

169
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:51.583
Hi.

170
00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:56.250
- Hi. Is your mother home?
- Yeah.

171
00:14:58.426 --> 00:14:59.825
Where is she?

172
00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:01.860
In the bath.

173
00:15:04.432 --> 00:15:06.559
Would you call her for us, please?

174
00:15:11.005 --> 00:15:12.438
What's wrong?

175
00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:16.370
Izzie.

176
00:15:17.311 --> 00:15:19.176
- Okay.
- Bye.

177
00:15:33.794 --> 00:15:35.261
Come in.

178
00:16:09.864 --> 00:16:13.425
You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.

179
00:16:20.641 --> 00:16:24.202
You've reached Captain Sam
Cahill. Please leave a message.

180
00:16:40.261 --> 00:16:41.694
Grace.

181
00:16:43.531 --> 00:16:45.965
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

182
00:16:48.102 --> 00:16:49.364
I was just dropping off the car.

183
00:16:49.503 --> 00:16:52.904
Sam told me I could borrow
it whenever I wanted, so...

184
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:58.237
The taillight's a little
busted. Some asshole...

185
00:17:03.717 --> 00:17:05.412
Look, you know...

186
00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:08.553
Just say it, you know
what I mean? All right.

187
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:11.522
He told me I could borrow the
car whenever I wanted, Grace.

188
00:17:11.692 --> 00:17:13.125
You look at me with
this pissed-off look.

189
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.693
Sam's dead.

190
00:17:18.098 --> 00:17:19.497
They crashed.

191
00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:23.860
- What are you talking about?
- He's dead, Tommy.

192
00:17:24.471 --> 00:17:26.302
Come in, come in.

193
00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:34.874
I don't wanna fucking come in.

194
00:17:36.784 --> 00:17:39.048
I just came here to drop off...

195
00:17:39.887 --> 00:17:43.152
- Why didn't you call me?
- I've been trying to call you all night.

196
00:17:43.324 --> 00:17:47.226
- Why didn't anybody call me?
- We've all been trying, Tommy.

197
00:17:48.929 --> 00:17:50.157
Okay.

198
00:17:53.867 --> 00:17:54.094
- Why'd you let him go over there, Grace?
- Tommy.

199
00:17:59.106 --> 00:18:01.165
For what now, huh?

200
00:18:18.425 --> 00:18:20.052
Tommy, come inside.

201
00:18:22.062 --> 00:18:24.496
I just had to sit down for a second.

202
00:18:32.206 --> 00:18:35.039
He's with your mama
now. They're together.

203
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:08.301
Drink?

204
00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:12.167
No.

205
00:19:43.877 --> 00:19:45.902
Girls? You ready?

206
00:19:47.014 --> 00:19:49.539
Yeah, in about just one minute.

207
00:19:51.318 --> 00:19:54.515
- Why'd you take your dress off?
- I hate it.

208
00:19:55.923 --> 00:19:58.892
We're going to put it
on, okay? We have to go.

209
00:19:59.293 --> 00:20:00.783
I don't want to.

210
00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:05.165
I don't want to wear
mine either. It's itchy.

211
00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.611
Okay, come here. Okay.

212
00:20:22.483 --> 00:20:23.916
Come here.

213
00:20:28.989 --> 00:20:32.083
- Okay.
- Is Dad really dead like your mom and dad?

214
00:21:21.842 --> 00:21:23.867
- I'm sorry.
- I appreciate it.

215
00:21:32.953 --> 00:21:35.547
- I'm so sorry, dear.
- Thanks for coming.

216
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.024
Sir, your son's the best
damn Marine I ever commanded.

217
00:21:39.193 --> 00:21:40.626
I appreciate it.

218
00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:45.498
- Come on, girls.
- Coming, Grandpa.

219
00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:47.531
- Get in the car.
- Come on, Maggie.

220
00:21:47.668 --> 00:21:50.193
- Elsie, I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'll watch them.

221
00:21:50.337 --> 00:21:51.429
Okay.

222
00:21:51.572 --> 00:21:56.509
Grace, Sam wrote this for you before he left.
He never wanted me to have to deliver it.

223
00:22:02.716 --> 00:22:04.684
I don't believe it, John.

224
00:22:05.552 --> 00:22:07.110
I can't feel it.

225
00:22:08.822 --> 00:22:11.052
Shouldn't I be able to feel it?

226
00:22:12.025 --> 00:22:15.927
It's hard to accept. He was
a good friend, a good Marine.

227
00:22:17.731 --> 00:22:20.598
- Why don't you let me drive?
- What are you talking about?

228
00:22:20.734 --> 00:22:23.100
- Come on, girls.
- Coming.

229
00:22:23.971 --> 00:22:26.235
Hey, why don't you
give me the keys, Dad?

230
00:22:26.373 --> 00:22:27.897
What makes you so
responsible all of a sudden?

231
00:22:30.244 --> 00:22:31.802
Let Tommy drive.

232
00:22:31.945 --> 00:22:34.277
"Let Tommy drive."
Look, I'll tell you what.

233
00:22:34.414 --> 00:22:36.644
Why don't you get a
job and earn some money,

234
00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:37.909
buy yourself a car,

235
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:41.020
and then you can drive it
wherever the hell you want.

236
00:22:41.154 --> 00:22:42.644
Give me the keys.

237
00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:48.854
Did you hear those Marines in there
today talking about your brother?

238
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:50.223
Did you?

239
00:22:51.265 --> 00:22:55.634
Who is gonna stand up and
testify for you once you're dead?

240
00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.501
Yeah, it's my fault Sam's dead.
Right? That's what you think.

241
00:23:02.009 --> 00:23:04.534
It's got nothing to do with you. Right?

242
00:23:05.479 --> 00:23:08.277
- What are you saying to me?
- Hank.

243
00:23:11.885 --> 00:23:12.817
Forget it.

244
00:23:13.887 --> 00:23:15.684
You never had any guts.

245
00:23:15.822 --> 00:23:17.414
And you did.

246
00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:19.923
That's why you screamed
at Mom every fucking night.

247
00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.654
That's why you drove us drunk,
huh? "Hang in there, Marines."

248
00:23:22.829 --> 00:23:26.162
- Don't. Come on.
- Why you put all that shit in his head.

249
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.427
- You could never fill his shoes.
- I know that.

250
00:23:28.569 --> 00:23:31.094
- Never could make me proud.
- For Lord's sake.

251
00:23:31.238 --> 00:23:32.865
That is a sin.

252
00:23:33.006 --> 00:23:36.442
- Stop it. Give me the keys.
- Here you go. I'm walking.

253
00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:09.997
This is a nightmare.

254
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:12.995
What's going on?

255
00:25:13.573 --> 00:25:15.803
What are they gonna do with us?

256
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:19.510
That yours?

257
00:25:20.447 --> 00:25:21.471
Yeah.

258
00:25:22.182 --> 00:25:23.649
That your wife?

259
00:25:24.384 --> 00:25:25.783
Cassie, yeah.

260
00:25:27.487 --> 00:25:28.920
No, she's not.

261
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.053
You don't have a wife.

262
00:25:32.492 --> 00:25:34.289
You don't have a family.

263
00:25:35.395 --> 00:25:37.556
I'm the only person you know.

264
00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:42.865
It's Private Willis and Captain
Cahill. You know nothing else.

265
00:25:44.037 --> 00:25:45.231
Yes, sir.

266
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.951
- Hello?
- Grace.

267
00:26:06.126 --> 00:26:07.058
Tommy?

268
00:26:08.128 --> 00:26:11.791
- Hi. I know it's like 1:00 in the morning.
- Yeah. It's 3:00.

269
00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:14.094
It's 3:00 in the morning.

270
00:26:14.234 --> 00:26:15.724
Okay. I had...

271
00:26:16.837 --> 00:26:19.271
I had a couple of
drinks and, apparently,

272
00:26:19.406 --> 00:26:22.898
they're the most expensive
drinks in the world. And...

273
00:26:24.344 --> 00:26:26.369
Now I owe, like, $47.

274
00:26:28.482 --> 00:26:30.245
I was gonna just walk out, but then

275
00:26:30.383 --> 00:26:33.477
this guy says that he was
gonna nick me on a disorderly.

276
00:26:34.454 --> 00:26:36.684
And then I'd lose my parole, so...

277
00:26:39.126 --> 00:26:40.388
Which bar?

278
00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:54.340
Your nose is like the lunar eclipse.

279
00:26:55.609 --> 00:26:58.077
- Come on, let me touch it. Let me just...
- Get your hands off me, Tommy.

280
00:26:58.211 --> 00:27:01.305
- Let me just touch it for a sec.
- Tommy, I'm sick of you. I'm sick of you.

281
00:27:01.448 --> 00:27:02.574
Don't get so upset with me.

282
00:27:02.716 --> 00:27:04.411
- All right. Go ahead.
- Thanks.

283
00:27:04.551 --> 00:27:06.178
See. Nothing to it. Right?

284
00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:08.378
- Big deal.
- That thing's huge, man.

285
00:27:08.522 --> 00:27:10.114
- Hi.
- Great.

286
00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.191
- How much does he owe you?
- $47 and two broken glasses.

287
00:27:13.326 --> 00:27:15.294
- Well, how about we say...
- Ready?

288
00:27:15.462 --> 00:27:17.692
- Come on, Cyrano.
- Get your hands off the bar.

289
00:27:17.831 --> 00:27:21.289
- Don't try to ignore it. That thing's huge.
- How about we say $50. Okay?

290
00:27:21.434 --> 00:27:22.924
- I don't care about the money...
- That thing's huge.

291
00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:25.003
...just get him out of here. I'm
gonna call the cops. I'm done.

292
00:27:25.138 --> 00:27:28.972
Tommy, I have two little girls sleeping
in a parking lot at 3:00 in the morning.

293
00:27:29.109 --> 00:27:30.940
You think you're funny?

294
00:27:34.514 --> 00:27:35.742
Go home.

295
00:27:50.363 --> 00:27:51.728
Oh, God.

296
00:27:55.335 --> 00:27:57.701
- My head's spinning.
- Be careful.

297
00:27:57.838 --> 00:28:01.365
- I don't think I should be carrying a child.
- Just put her in her bed, okay?

298
00:28:01.508 --> 00:28:02.873
Oh, my God.

299
00:28:10.584 --> 00:28:12.449
- Uncle Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

300
00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:14.486
Uncle Tommy, wake up.

301
00:28:17.257 --> 00:28:19.020
Can you stop that?

302
00:28:19.192 --> 00:28:22.889
I'm making pancakes for Mom.
I can't stop. My sister said.

303
00:28:27.133 --> 00:28:28.498
Stop it.

304
00:28:29.369 --> 00:28:30.495
No.

305
00:28:42.082 --> 00:28:44.073
What are you doing here?

306
00:28:44.217 --> 00:28:47.050
You want me to whisk in your face, too?

307
00:28:47.187 --> 00:28:50.645
This is not your house, and
you're not the boss of me.

308
00:28:57.297 --> 00:28:58.457
Come on.

309
00:29:04.271 --> 00:29:06.933
We're making pancakes for
Mom, so she won't be sad.

310
00:29:07.073 --> 00:29:10.008
- Our dad's dead.
- He knows. He's his brother.

311
00:29:10.143 --> 00:29:11.542
I know that.

312
00:29:11.678 --> 00:29:14.579
No drinking out of
the carton! It's gross!

313
00:29:16.316 --> 00:29:18.113
Shut up. You're gross.

314
00:29:18.885 --> 00:29:20.876
- No!
- You want a pancake?

315
00:29:21.021 --> 00:29:23.046
No, I don't like pancakes.

316
00:29:23.723 --> 00:29:27.386
- Our pancakes are the best.
- Eat your own crap, all right?

317
00:29:28.094 --> 00:29:30.324
Mom! You're supposed to be upstairs.

318
00:29:30.463 --> 00:29:32.556
- What are you doing awake?
- It's a surprise!

319
00:29:32.699 --> 00:29:35.896
I am surprised. Thank you.

320
00:29:36.036 --> 00:29:39.472
The nicest little girls in the world.

321
00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:43.333
Who's that?

322
00:29:45.478 --> 00:29:47.139
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

323
00:29:47.914 --> 00:29:49.347
- Hey, babies.
- Hi!

324
00:29:49.482 --> 00:29:52.178
- What have you got in your hair?
- Pancake batter.

325
00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:54.514
- Pancake batter.
- Hi, sweetie.

326
00:29:55.755 --> 00:29:58.588
- Hey, let's go watch TV.
- Come on, girls.

327
00:29:59.326 --> 00:30:01.487
- I'll get the syrup.
- What a mess.

328
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:04.926
- Bye, Tommy.
- We'll clean this up later.

329
00:30:18.778 --> 00:30:20.109
Morning.

330
00:30:23.416 --> 00:30:25.008
Pancakes, huh?

331
00:30:26.886 --> 00:30:30.253
Yeah, actually there's one
on the floor if you want it.

332
00:30:38.898 --> 00:30:42.732
- What are they doing in here?
- They were making pancakes.

333
00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:50.374
Look...

334
00:30:52.278 --> 00:30:55.372
- I was a little stupid the other day.
- Yeah, hey.

335
00:30:57.017 --> 00:31:01.147
- I was okay to drive, though.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. I know.

336
00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:22.800
I know Sam was always smarter than me.

337
00:31:27.614 --> 00:31:31.948
Well, I don't know about smarter.
He was a damn good athlete.

338
00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:37.815
Remember that game against Easton?

339
00:31:37.991 --> 00:31:40.016
Cool as ice.

340
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:49.827
You had some talent,
too, you know. I mean...

341
00:31:51.771 --> 00:31:53.568
You just quit all the time.

342
00:31:53.706 --> 00:31:56.834
Now, that was the difference
between you and him.

343
00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.510
Sam had no quit in him.

344
00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:26.569
I'd cut my throat to
bring him back, Dad.

345
00:32:33.947 --> 00:32:35.676
God damn it.

346
00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:40.445
I don't know how she lives
with this kitchen the way it is.

347
00:32:51.431 --> 00:32:53.991
Private, come here. Fucking help me.

348
00:32:54.134 --> 00:32:55.863
I can't see anything.

349
00:32:58.238 --> 00:32:59.728
They're looking for us.

350
00:33:02.075 --> 00:33:03.406
All right.

351
00:33:22.395 --> 00:33:25.091
- Should we try again?
- Not right now.

352
00:33:46.386 --> 00:33:49.355
Come on, man. Just put
it where you got it.

353
00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:51.116
Grace. Hey.

354
00:33:52.725 --> 00:33:55.125
You remember, A.J., Owen.

355
00:33:59.566 --> 00:34:02.433
Sweeney... I don't
remember your first name.

356
00:34:02.569 --> 00:34:03.934
There's a reason for that.

357
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.265
- It's nice to meet you, Grace.
- You, too.

358
00:34:07.207 --> 00:34:08.731
What's going on?

359
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:13.904
We're just fixing up
the kitchen for you.

360
00:34:15.515 --> 00:34:16.641
Tommy.

361
00:34:20.887 --> 00:34:22.514
Were you ever going to run this by me?

362
00:34:22.655 --> 00:34:25.123
- Can you believe it? She's gorgeous.
- It's my house.

363
00:34:25.258 --> 00:34:26.725
- Somebody's all growed up.
- It's not funny.

364
00:34:26.893 --> 00:34:30.056
What the hell is wrong
with you guys? She's been...

365
00:34:30.196 --> 00:34:32.221
You have to run this by me.

366
00:34:36.903 --> 00:34:38.131
I was...

367
00:34:42.842 --> 00:34:46.334
- Can I get you guys coffee, something?
- No, thanks.

368
00:34:47.513 --> 00:34:50.676
- Maybe a beer.
- I would like a beer, too.

369
00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:53.180
Don't tell them anything.

370
00:34:53.319 --> 00:34:55.219
Don't you tell them anything, Private.

371
00:34:56.189 --> 00:34:58.180
They're not asking me anything.

372
00:34:59.259 --> 00:35:00.692
They're just starving us.

373
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.452
Stay calm, Private.

374
00:35:03.863 --> 00:35:07.299
- Be present.
- I am fucking present.

375
00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:11.301
I'm fucking present. I've been present
in this shithole for two fucking months.

376
00:35:11.437 --> 00:35:14.873
What the fuck did you save me
for? Why did you come after me?

377
00:35:16.142 --> 00:35:19.305
I should've drowned in that lake.
We'd both be better off dead.

378
00:35:22.048 --> 00:35:23.538
What day is it?

379
00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:37.124
Saturday.

380
00:35:39.532 --> 00:35:41.090
What time is it?

381
00:35:49.075 --> 00:35:50.337
About noon.

382
00:36:21.341 --> 00:36:23.104
You remember what I told you.

383
00:36:23.276 --> 00:36:27.474
No information. You give them nothing.
You give them nothing, Private.

384
00:36:27.613 --> 00:36:28.602
Yeah.

385
00:36:37.957 --> 00:36:40.949
- Where are they taking us?
- Don't speak. Don't speak!

386
00:36:46.265 --> 00:36:49.325
- Are they gonna cut our heads off?
- Not another fucking word!

387
00:37:29.942 --> 00:37:31.136
Welcome.

388
00:37:43.122 --> 00:37:45.352
I used the satellite
phone to call my wife.

389
00:37:46.626 --> 00:37:47.752
She's pregnant.

390
00:37:48.795 --> 00:37:51.821
I jeopardized your
location and your mission.

391
00:37:54.033 --> 00:37:54.499
We have the same blood.

392
00:37:56.836 --> 00:37:58.827
Syed is my nephew.

393
00:38:22.895 --> 00:38:24.192
Fuck them.

394
00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:34.836
This is our country.

395
00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:38.640
You should not be here.

396
00:38:42.915 --> 00:38:44.906
Tell this message to America.

397
00:38:46.085 --> 00:38:47.017
You say it,

398
00:38:49.388 --> 00:38:51.288
or I'll force you to say it.

399
00:39:39.939 --> 00:39:41.600
The girls are back.

400
00:39:42.041 --> 00:39:44.168
It's a good thing downstairs.

401
00:39:50.082 --> 00:39:51.913
I'll see you tomorrow.

402
00:39:53.619 --> 00:39:54.881
Thanks, Elsie.

403
00:39:56.122 --> 00:39:57.054
Okay.

404
00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:07.160
- Who is painting the kitchen?
- I am.

405
00:40:10.002 --> 00:40:10.969
Get that spot right there.

406
00:40:11.103 --> 00:40:13.901
You know, your dad was a great
football player in high school.

407
00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.405
- Really?
- Yeah.

408
00:40:16.175 --> 00:40:19.144
He was small, but he
was a great quarterback.

409
00:40:20.212 --> 00:40:24.546
Me and A.J. and Owen used to go to
the games just to watch him play.

410
00:40:26.619 --> 00:40:27.950
Did you ever have a
chance to see him play?

411
00:40:28.054 --> 00:40:29.021
No.

412
00:40:29.155 --> 00:40:31.715
- Izzie, you're so tall.
- Thanks.

413
00:40:35.294 --> 00:40:38.092
- Good job, Mag.
- Thanks, Mom.

414
00:40:45.237 --> 00:40:47.102
Do they need to do their
homework or something?

415
00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:49.503
No. She's having fun.

416
00:40:51.544 --> 00:40:52.738
Get these real good.

417
00:40:54.146 --> 00:40:55.204
Shit the bed!

418
00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:00.180
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

419
00:41:04.123 --> 00:41:05.886
These are brand new pants.

420
00:41:06.659 --> 00:41:08.286
- Hey, man...
- I'm sorry.

421
00:41:09.128 --> 00:41:10.493
Chill out, man. She said she was sorry.

422
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.463
It's okay, Maggie. I think I
have something for you, okay?

423
00:41:13.599 --> 00:41:14.691
- Just wait here.
- Do you have a bathroom...

424
00:41:14.834 --> 00:41:17.496
No. Please don't bring
the paint in, okay?

425
00:41:17.637 --> 00:41:20.606
- It's not that bad, man.
- Take it easy, man.

426
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.265
There's almost nothing on
you, man. You look fine.

427
00:41:23.409 --> 00:41:26.936
That will come out. I mean, the
real major cleanup is the floor.

428
00:41:27.079 --> 00:41:28.171
You're such a dick.

429
00:41:28.314 --> 00:41:31.010
- Looks like it just grazed you.
- It doesn't look that bad.

430
00:41:34.987 --> 00:41:35.885
You're right.

431
00:41:37.023 --> 00:41:38.251
Let's hug it out.

432
00:41:38.891 --> 00:41:40.153
- Hugs?
- What's he talking about?

433
00:41:40.326 --> 00:41:41.759
- Hugs.
- What?

434
00:41:43.462 --> 00:41:46.454
Stay away from the kid.
Stay away from the kid.

435
00:41:46.632 --> 00:41:48.293
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

436
00:42:24.737 --> 00:42:26.671
You have a lovely body, Owen.

437
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:31.098
Fuck me.

438
00:42:32.812 --> 00:42:34.336
Do you work out?

439
00:42:37.983 --> 00:42:39.416
Can I ask you where
you got your underwear?

440
00:42:39.552 --> 00:42:41.383
Because they fit. They
fit perfectly like...

441
00:42:41.987 --> 00:42:43.921
You guys are so fucking funny.

442
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.058
I'm asking you a serious
question, that's all.

443
00:42:46.258 --> 00:42:47.589
These should all fit you.

444
00:42:47.727 --> 00:42:50.753
All I need is a T-shirt and some pants.

445
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.261
Take it all.

446
00:42:52.898 --> 00:42:54.729
I don't need all this.

447
00:43:00.873 --> 00:43:03.398
She didn't have to give me all this.

448
00:43:05.244 --> 00:43:06.836
Just take it all, man.

449
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:11.879
- I don't have to bring it back?
- Jesus. Are you listening? Take the clothes.

450
00:43:12.017 --> 00:43:14.611
- I was just fucking asking.
- Take them.

451
00:43:43.516 --> 00:43:45.848
Do you want to help your friend?

452
00:43:49.755 --> 00:43:51.313
Now it's his turn.

453
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:58.393
- Stay strong, Private.
- Yes, sir.

454
00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:04.060
Fuck!

455
00:44:06.872 --> 00:44:08.737
Don't give them anything!

456
00:44:09.475 --> 00:44:10.635
Private!

457
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:13.945
Your life depends on it!

458
00:44:14.079 --> 00:44:15.011
Please.

459
00:44:19.585 --> 00:44:23.521
Fuck! Motherfuckers! I
will fucking kill you!

460
00:44:25.124 --> 00:44:26.557
Christ!

461
00:44:27.626 --> 00:44:31.585
My name is Private Joe Willis. I'm
with the United States Marine Corps.

462
00:44:31.764 --> 00:44:35.063
I was told I was coming
here to fight for my country.

463
00:44:36.368 --> 00:44:40.270
But now I realize that
Afghanistan belongs to its people.

464
00:44:41.307 --> 00:44:43.673
And we have no business being here.

465
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:46.940
I love you, Cassie.

466
00:44:48.848 --> 00:44:51.214
Joe Jr., your daddy always loves you.

467
00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:58.720
You have two daughters.

468
00:45:02.461 --> 00:45:04.429
Okay. Dad, get down.

469
00:45:04.597 --> 00:45:05.529
- How's this?
- Perfect.

470
00:45:05.698 --> 00:45:08.326
- Great. Great.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

471
00:45:40.432 --> 00:45:42.593
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

472
00:45:43.535 --> 00:45:44.627
Happy birthday!

473
00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:47.929
- You like the kitchen?
- I love it.

474
00:45:48.073 --> 00:45:49.597
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

475
00:45:49.742 --> 00:45:50.674
You're welcome.

476
00:45:51.176 --> 00:45:52.871
Mom, this is from Deedee.

477
00:45:53.012 --> 00:45:54.946
- Thank you, Deedee.
- You're welcome.

478
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:57.747
- Can I help you open it?
- Yes, please.

479
00:45:59.018 --> 00:46:00.246
- She looking now?
- No, she's opening the presents.

480
00:46:00.386 --> 00:46:01.853
Good job on the kitchen.

481
00:46:02.488 --> 00:46:03.512
What did he just say to me?

482
00:46:03.656 --> 00:46:05.681
He said you did a good
job on the kitchen.

483
00:46:06.125 --> 00:46:07.057
Okay. Go, go.

484
00:46:27.846 --> 00:46:30.110
Blow out the candles. Come on, come on.

485
00:46:31.917 --> 00:46:33.043
Do it.

486
00:46:39.491 --> 00:46:40.788
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

487
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.520
- Happy birthday, Mama.
- Thank you.

488
00:46:48.767 --> 00:46:50.667
Maggie? Maggie.

489
00:46:51.236 --> 00:46:52.760
- No!
- Maggie, slow down.

490
00:46:52.905 --> 00:46:54.668
Maggie, be careful.

491
00:46:58.811 --> 00:46:59.835
What are you doing?

492
00:46:59.979 --> 00:47:02.038
I want to get to the ice before my mama.

493
00:47:02.181 --> 00:47:04.581
Well, you better wait
for her, don't you think?

494
00:47:05.284 --> 00:47:07.047
Everybody loves Maggie.

495
00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.547
- Why do you say that?
- Because she's lovable.

496
00:47:19.064 --> 00:47:20.793
You know, your dad saved me

497
00:47:20.933 --> 00:47:23.401
in that water, right there,
when we were both kids.

498
00:47:25.871 --> 00:47:27.600
You know, you're like your dad.

499
00:47:28.307 --> 00:47:29.365
Am I?

500
00:47:33.545 --> 00:47:35.172
Am I like my mom?

501
00:47:37.216 --> 00:47:39.013
A spitting image, yeah.

502
00:47:40.686 --> 00:47:44.315
Except you're yourself,
Isabelle. And everybody loves you.

503
00:47:45.057 --> 00:47:46.251
Come on.

504
00:48:12.184 --> 00:48:13.412
I did it!

505
00:49:19.184 --> 00:49:21.584
I talked to her for over an hour.

506
00:49:23.388 --> 00:49:27.347
She said to me that she hadn't
slept right in over three years.

507
00:49:28.494 --> 00:49:32.692
She kept having these nightmares
that I would come back and shoot her.

508
00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:37.899
I don't know.

509
00:49:40.539 --> 00:49:43.565
I told her it was all right,
that I wasn't gonna hurt her.

510
00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.110
She just started to cry.

511
00:49:50.649 --> 00:49:53.618
Right there in the bank,
she just started to cry.

512
00:49:58.323 --> 00:50:00.018
And she thanked me.

513
00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:06.858
She said that she felt like...

514
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.924
What did she say?

515
00:50:12.204 --> 00:50:14.172
Like she could breathe again.

516
00:50:16.275 --> 00:50:19.438
And then she asked if I wanted
to open up a bank account.

517
00:50:19.578 --> 00:50:20.510
No.

518
00:50:21.113 --> 00:50:22.341
I swear to God.

519
00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:24.540
- What did you do?
- I opened an account.

520
00:50:29.421 --> 00:50:30.979
I'm proud of you.

521
00:50:33.091 --> 00:50:35.525
I can't wait to start bouncing checks.

522
00:50:49.274 --> 00:50:54.007
When I was like 17 or 18,

523
00:51:01.019 --> 00:51:05.513
I used to listen to this song,
like, over and over again.

524
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:06.885
Me, too.

525
00:51:09.528 --> 00:51:10.825
Really?

526
00:51:10.963 --> 00:51:12.897
Why is that so surprising?

527
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.300
I don't know. I just...

528
00:51:20.405 --> 00:51:22.873
I took you more for,
like, an 'NSync fan.

529
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:24.167
Fuck you.

530
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:26.243
Give me that.

531
00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:28.573
- Really?
- Really.

532
00:51:42.227 --> 00:51:44.252
You think I'm such a square.

533
00:51:45.097 --> 00:51:47.429
I'm starting to reassess, Snoop Dogg.

534
00:51:54.072 --> 00:51:56.597
Just because I was a
cheerleader, it doesn't...

535
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.901
Yeah, and you dated a football player.

536
00:52:01.046 --> 00:52:02.707
I am such a cliché.

537
00:52:09.688 --> 00:52:11.952
You were kind of a pain in
the ass. You got to admit that.

538
00:52:12.124 --> 00:52:13.751
No, I wasn't.

539
00:52:14.626 --> 00:52:18.084
Guys always say that girls are
stuck up if they won't talk to them.

540
00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.561
I just didn't like you.

541
00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:23.259
You were always drunk and fighting...

542
00:53:02.441 --> 00:53:04.602
I have to get some air.

543
00:54:54.186 --> 00:54:55.346
Captain!

544
00:54:57.355 --> 00:54:58.720
Captain!

545
00:55:40.699 --> 00:55:41.859
Take it.

546
00:56:02.554 --> 00:56:03.919
What do we do?

547
00:56:06.124 --> 00:56:08.115
He has no value for us.

548
00:56:10.529 --> 00:56:12.690
Just a weight on our shoulder.

549
00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.768
Waste of food and water.

550
00:56:20.005 --> 00:56:21.131
Kill him.

551
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.322
Pick it up.

552
00:56:45.864 --> 00:56:47.126
You have family?

553
00:56:50.001 --> 00:56:51.491
Do you want to see them again?

554
00:56:53.138 --> 00:56:55.003
Pick up the pipe!

555
00:57:00.979 --> 00:57:03.004
- Captain...
- It's you or him.

556
00:57:04.482 --> 00:57:06.279
Kill him or I will kill you.

557
00:57:08.086 --> 00:57:11.920
Kill him! Kill him or
I will cut his head off!

558
00:57:12.157 --> 00:57:13.556
Kill him! Kill him!

559
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.920
Kill him!

560
00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:19.888
Kill him!

561
00:58:16.187 --> 00:58:17.176
Shit.

562
00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:31.660
I brought you some molding.

563
00:58:47.852 --> 00:58:49.479
Hey, look, I don't want to
ruin anything, all right.

564
00:58:49.621 --> 00:58:52.681
I just want to be able to
come over and see the girls.

565
00:58:52.857 --> 00:58:55.655
Please, I would love you
to come see the girls.

566
00:59:00.665 --> 00:59:02.292
We just miss Sam.

567
00:59:04.869 --> 00:59:05.927
Yeah.

568
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:12.474
That's Hank.

569
00:59:22.253 --> 00:59:24.016
You still at it, huh?

570
00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:31.488
Where did you ever learn to be so handy?

571
01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:17.166
Cover there!

572
01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:23.271
Move forward. Moving forward!

573
01:00:23.414 --> 01:00:24.711
Come on. Let's go.

574
01:00:28.219 --> 01:00:29.311
Straight ahead!

575
01:00:29.854 --> 01:00:31.321
- Stop right there!
- Get your hands up.

576
01:00:31.456 --> 01:00:33.185
Come to me. Come to me.

577
01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:35.717
Come on. Get your hands up.

578
01:00:36.394 --> 01:00:39.056
Get your hands up. Right here. Get down.

579
01:00:43.468 --> 01:00:44.799
You a Marine?

580
01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:50.474
Cahill, is that your name?

581
01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:52.542
Was there anyone else with you?

582
01:00:54.879 --> 01:00:56.471
- Come on. Ready?
- Come on.

583
01:01:01.419 --> 01:01:03.216
Get it on. Get it on.

584
01:01:03.922 --> 01:01:05.184
We need a nose.

585
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.815
- Mom, nose.
- Nose.

586
01:01:08.426 --> 01:01:09.723
- Nose!
- Here.

587
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:12.056
Get the nose. Get the nose.

588
01:01:14.532 --> 01:01:16.397
He is looking hot, you guys.

589
01:01:18.203 --> 01:01:19.830
Can you teach them
how to throw snowballs?

590
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.632
Because they can't even hit me.

591
01:01:25.476 --> 01:01:26.636
That one hit you.

592
01:01:27.612 --> 01:01:30.137
Maybe I should hit you
with a massive snowball.

593
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:32.743
Come on.

594
01:01:33.785 --> 01:01:35.082
Izzie, Izzie, are you okay?

595
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.347
Izzie, Izzie. Hey, hey, hey.

596
01:01:37.488 --> 01:01:39.388
- Are you okay?
- Grace.

597
01:01:39.557 --> 01:01:41.991
Sucker! Sucker.

598
01:01:42.427 --> 01:01:43.689
Get him! Get him!

599
01:01:47.265 --> 01:01:48.698
Get him. Try and get him.

600
01:01:49.801 --> 01:01:50.825
Hello?

601
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:53.030
Yes, this is she.

602
01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.540
See this cheater-pants over here.

603
01:01:57.342 --> 01:01:59.003
Come on. You freaked me out.

604
01:02:11.189 --> 01:02:12.952
- What?
- Not me.

605
01:02:13.992 --> 01:02:16.187
It was him! Get up.

606
01:02:33.678 --> 01:02:35.543
Hey. What's going on?

607
01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:38.746
- Uncle Tommy, she grabbed my hair.
- Okay.

608
01:02:38.883 --> 01:02:41.010
I'm sorry. I want to keep playing.

609
01:02:41.152 --> 01:02:42.346
Okay. What?

610
01:02:58.469 --> 01:03:00.437
- Can I go out?
- Not yet.

611
01:03:00.571 --> 01:03:04.029
- Why?
- Because we have to be patient. Okay?

612
01:03:06.978 --> 01:03:09.412
- Sir.
- Welcome home, Sam.

613
01:03:09.547 --> 01:03:10.673
Thanks.

614
01:03:19.524 --> 01:03:20.752
Daddy!

615
01:03:22.126 --> 01:03:24.993
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

616
01:03:26.297 --> 01:03:27.594
My babies.

617
01:04:00.198 --> 01:04:01.859
I love you, honey.

618
01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.507
- Here, let me take your bag.
- Sure.

619
01:04:22.086 --> 01:04:23.678
Come on. Come on. Hurry.

620
01:04:24.389 --> 01:04:26.550
Do you like it? Do you like it?

621
01:04:26.724 --> 01:04:29.522
Wow. It's amazing.

622
01:04:30.395 --> 01:04:31.521
I think he likes it.

623
01:04:32.764 --> 01:04:34.254
- Who did it?
- Me.

624
01:04:34.432 --> 01:04:36.491
- You did?
- And Uncle Tommy.

625
01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:38.760
Uncle Tommy and 'three amigos'.

626
01:05:05.396 --> 01:05:07.057
Are you tired, honey?

627
01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:10.592
Come, get in bed. Everyone.

628
01:05:12.203 --> 01:05:13.636
This is fun.

629
01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.000
- I missed you, Daddy.
- Me, too.

630
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:20.172
My girls.

631
01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:23.378
That's us, all right.

632
01:05:34.959 --> 01:05:36.517
Can I get up, Mom?

633
01:05:38.129 --> 01:05:39.926
Dad, it's not bedtime.

634
01:05:54.312 --> 01:05:55.973
I locked that door.

635
01:05:57.548 --> 01:05:58.913
It's broken.

636
01:06:17.635 --> 01:06:19.830
I'm just gonna finish shaving.

637
01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.568
- Banged up well, huh?
- Yeah.

638
01:06:57.008 --> 01:06:59.738
Can't you take that
down to the mechanic?

639
01:07:02.046 --> 01:07:03.274
I got it.

640
01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:06.109
Nothing else to do.

641
01:07:09.086 --> 01:07:10.280
You okay?

642
01:07:12.056 --> 01:07:13.080
Yeah.

643
01:07:18.763 --> 01:07:25.293
'Cause after I got back from Nam,
I couldn't talk to your mother.

644
01:07:27.872 --> 01:07:32.309
I guess I took it out on
you and Tommy, you know, I...

645
01:07:33.177 --> 01:07:34.701
I don't know why.

646
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:42.341
Look, if you ever wanna
talk, let me know. All right?

647
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:08.603
You okay?

648
01:08:12.617 --> 01:08:13.948
You're good.

649
01:08:15.453 --> 01:08:17.512
Better than I thought, yeah.

650
01:08:19.023 --> 01:08:21.491
You look good out there with them.

651
01:08:30.768 --> 01:08:32.998
Thanks for taking care of them.

652
01:08:33.871 --> 01:08:35.236
I didn't expect that.

653
01:08:35.373 --> 01:08:37.739
It just comes naturally, you know.

654
01:08:43.047 --> 01:08:45.572
It makes me start to think, you know.

655
01:08:53.758 --> 01:08:55.658
Grace is something, huh?

656
01:08:59.597 --> 01:09:01.121
Did you fuck her?

657
01:09:04.402 --> 01:09:05.027
What? You kidding?

658
01:09:07.805 --> 01:09:09.272
I'd understand.

659
01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:14.108
- You thought I was dead.
- Stop it.

660
01:09:15.746 --> 01:09:17.008
Tommy,

661
01:09:18.549 --> 01:09:19.743
I could forgive you.

662
01:09:30.328 --> 01:09:32.421
What's going on in your head?

663
01:09:34.065 --> 01:09:36.192
What's making you think that?

664
01:09:40.438 --> 01:09:45.000
You guys just look like two
teenagers in love out there.

665
01:09:46.777 --> 01:09:48.039
All right.

666
01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.875
I mean, you know?

667
01:09:52.116 --> 01:09:53.811
You can't deny that.

668
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.224
You can tell me.

669
01:10:12.903 --> 01:10:14.768
You gotta tell me. You understand?

670
01:10:15.806 --> 01:10:18.070
- I know you slept in my house.
- Sam. Sam...

671
01:10:18.209 --> 01:10:21.144
Hey, don't bullshit me.

672
01:10:38.262 --> 01:10:39.957
Joe Jr., come back.

673
01:10:41.799 --> 01:10:43.391
Cassie, he's fine.

674
01:10:45.302 --> 01:10:48.794
Ever since his dad died, I
can't let him out of my sight.

675
01:10:49.907 --> 01:10:52.569
Look at him. He's got a mind of his own.

676
01:10:53.577 --> 01:10:57.638
I have this nightmare where
Joe is looking up at me,

677
01:10:58.516 --> 01:10:59.778
and he's trying to tell me something.

678
01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:02.715
He's trying to talk
to me, but the teeth,

679
01:11:02.853 --> 01:11:06.721
his teeth just fall out of
his mouth and there is blood,

680
01:11:08.926 --> 01:11:12.259
and I'm scrabbling
around picking them up.

681
01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:16.898
And then last night,
your husband was there.

682
01:11:18.335 --> 01:11:20.030
And he looks at my hand,
and he takes my hand,

683
01:11:20.171 --> 01:11:22.605
and he looks at my wedding
ring and he just smiles at me.

684
01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:27.006
- Did he say anything?
- No. He just smiled.

685
01:11:31.816 --> 01:11:34.580
In the dream, I hated
him for being alive.

686
01:11:36.187 --> 01:11:39.213
That's why I came over
to apologize. I'm sorry.

687
01:11:40.624 --> 01:11:44.720
I'm sick of feeling like this all
the time. I want to forgive them.

688
01:11:44.895 --> 01:11:47.261
I want to be able to forgive them.

689
01:11:52.303 --> 01:11:53.634
Poor Joe Jr.

690
01:11:55.206 --> 01:11:56.332
He knows.

691
01:11:57.541 --> 01:12:01.272
He's just like his daddy. He
knows exactly what I'm thinking.

692
01:12:07.284 --> 01:12:09.184
Where are you going, huh?

693
01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:14.147
- Sam.
- Hi.

694
01:12:16.327 --> 01:12:18.056
Did you see him die?

695
01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:22.964
No.

696
01:12:24.034 --> 01:12:25.831
Did you hear anything?

697
01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:28.772
I mean, was he on his own?

698
01:12:30.474 --> 01:12:32.601
He was brave. I know that.

699
01:12:35.446 --> 01:12:37.277
That's Captain Cahill.

700
01:12:38.215 --> 01:12:40.615
He was friends with your daddy.

701
01:12:40.751 --> 01:12:44.084
Wave. Are you gonna
wave? Are you gonna wave?

702
01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.648
You're a good man.

703
01:12:48.726 --> 01:12:51.320
Baby, where are you going? Come here.

704
01:14:23.721 --> 01:14:26.554
- Sir, Captain Cahill.
- Send him in.

705
01:14:27.958 --> 01:14:29.789
I want to go back, sir.

706
01:14:30.894 --> 01:14:33.021
I'm ready. Need to see my men.

707
01:14:34.198 --> 01:14:36.223
How's the counseling going?

708
01:14:36.667 --> 01:14:38.396
Yeah. I saw Thompson.

709
01:14:39.637 --> 01:14:44.836
Everything pretty good there and,
you know, just thinking about my men

710
01:14:44.975 --> 01:14:48.001
and want to get back.

711
01:14:48.145 --> 01:14:49.442
That's good.

712
01:14:50.914 --> 01:14:52.541
How's the family?

713
01:14:56.153 --> 01:14:57.984
I can't be there, sir.

714
01:14:58.522 --> 01:14:59.546
Yeah?

715
01:15:01.592 --> 01:15:03.389
They don't understand.

716
01:15:05.896 --> 01:15:08.387
You know, I mean, nobody understands.

717
01:15:10.501 --> 01:15:12.935
It's gonna take a little time, Sam.

718
01:15:13.937 --> 01:15:15.802
You've been through a lot of shit.

719
01:15:17.341 --> 01:15:19.241
So has your family.

720
01:15:19.376 --> 01:15:21.037
I don't mind Brian.

721
01:15:22.146 --> 01:15:25.912
He never hits people, only
the boys, but not the girls.

722
01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:27.745
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

723
01:15:28.352 --> 01:15:32.755
And he has a dog with really big ears.
I can't remember his name, though.

724
01:15:32.923 --> 01:15:34.117
Elephant?

725
01:15:38.662 --> 01:15:40.391
An elephant's not a dog.

726
01:15:40.798 --> 01:15:42.993
I know an elephant's not a dog.

727
01:15:43.133 --> 01:15:44.395
Then why did you say it?

728
01:15:44.535 --> 01:15:48.801
Because elephants have big
ears and so does his dog.

729
01:15:48.939 --> 01:15:54.434
So, big ears, get it?

730
01:15:54.912 --> 01:15:57.574
It's really funny if
you think about it, Dad.

731
01:15:57.815 --> 01:15:58.873
Sam, relax.

732
01:15:59.016 --> 01:16:00.711
But how is it funny?

733
01:16:01.785 --> 01:16:02.979
Big ears.

734
01:16:17.868 --> 01:16:22.931
- Is Dad okay, Mom?
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

735
01:16:24.708 --> 01:16:26.335
When is Uncle Tommy coming?

736
01:16:26.477 --> 01:16:28.342
- He's coming soon, sweetie, okay?
- Okay.

737
01:16:28.479 --> 01:16:30.447
He wants to play with you.

738
01:16:31.648 --> 01:16:32.979
- Okay?
- Okay.

739
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:36.610
- I'm gonna go check on Daddy, okay?
- Okay.

740
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.629
Sammy, what happened?

741
01:16:52.936 --> 01:16:54.494
What's going on?

742
01:16:55.572 --> 01:16:56.903
Talk to me.

743
01:16:58.742 --> 01:17:00.175
What happened?

744
01:17:01.812 --> 01:17:03.712
What did they do to you?

745
01:17:05.749 --> 01:17:08.047
What happened with you and Tommy?

746
01:17:21.665 --> 01:17:23.394
We kissed. That's it.

747
01:17:26.303 --> 01:17:27.702
I missed you.

748
01:17:28.872 --> 01:17:30.772
I thought you were dead.

749
01:17:32.309 --> 01:17:34.277
I couldn't get out of bed.

750
01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.477
That's it.

751
01:17:45.689 --> 01:17:49.250
- You told me the truth?
- You know.

752
01:17:55.065 --> 01:17:56.396
Now tell me.

753
01:18:14.985 --> 01:18:17.112
I think you're fucking Tommy.

754
01:18:17.921 --> 01:18:19.047
Sam...

755
01:19:07.004 --> 01:19:09.700
Come on, come on. Faster. Faster.

756
01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:14.700
Why did you stop pulling?

757
01:19:17.281 --> 01:19:18.270
Hey.

758
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:21.842
You girls playing?

759
01:19:26.857 --> 01:19:28.290
What's wrong?

760
01:19:35.032 --> 01:19:36.294
It's okay.

761
01:19:41.238 --> 01:19:42.933
I was just confused.

762
01:19:46.176 --> 01:19:47.837
It's gonna be okay.

763
01:19:49.313 --> 01:19:51.975
Come here. Give me a hug.

764
01:19:53.216 --> 01:19:56.913
Now. Those are my girls.

765
01:20:05.028 --> 01:20:08.429
Why did the girl blush when
she opened the refrigerator?

766
01:20:08.598 --> 01:20:12.090
- She saw the salad dressing.
- She saw the salad dressing.

767
01:20:12.636 --> 01:20:14.001
I told you guys that one?

768
01:20:15.372 --> 01:20:16.964
A thousand times.

769
01:20:17.107 --> 01:20:19.041
It's still funny, though.

770
01:20:24.114 --> 01:20:24.341
Have fun.

771
01:20:50.574 --> 01:20:52.269
Where have you been?

772
01:20:52.642 --> 01:20:56.408
I was outside

773
01:20:57.547 --> 01:21:04.009
just thinking and...

774
01:21:11.528 --> 01:21:14.986
I was just thinking
about you and the kids

775
01:21:15.165 --> 01:21:20.034
and the sun came up and I thought,

776
01:21:22.005 --> 01:21:23.939
I'm so lucky to be alive.

777
01:21:45.095 --> 01:21:47.893
We're gonna be late. Come on.

778
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:49.464
Do you have a spelling test today?

779
01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:53.433
Come on, Grandpa. It's my
birthday. It's my birthday!

780
01:21:58.375 --> 01:22:01.242
Can I open my presents now? Please.

781
01:22:01.378 --> 01:22:02.970
I think we should wait.

782
01:22:03.113 --> 01:22:04.137
Wait for Uncle Tommy.

783
01:22:04.281 --> 01:22:08.911
- Pretty please.
- Well, let her open just one. It won't hurt.

784
01:22:09.519 --> 01:22:12.647
- You can open Grandpa's.
- Thank you.

785
01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:14.085
Just one.

786
01:22:14.257 --> 01:22:16.521
- Okay, Mom.
- Let me show you which it is.

787
01:22:16.693 --> 01:22:18.251
Is it the big one?

788
01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:20.253
It's Uncle Tommy!

789
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:21.454
Let's guess.

790
01:22:28.071 --> 01:22:29.095
Izzie.

791
01:22:29.239 --> 01:22:30.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

792
01:22:33.243 --> 01:22:34.835
What's the matter?

793
01:22:36.179 --> 01:22:37.703
Is she okay?

794
01:22:38.482 --> 01:22:41.315
- Hi.
- Grace, this is Tina.

795
01:22:41.451 --> 01:22:42.850
- I'm Tina.
- Nice to meet you.

796
01:22:42.986 --> 01:22:44.886
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my brother's wife, Grace.

797
01:22:45.021 --> 01:22:47.148
We're all in the dining room.

798
01:22:49.292 --> 01:22:51.783
Oh, my God. She's so pretty.

799
01:23:01.371 --> 01:23:02.895
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

800
01:23:03.707 --> 01:23:05.140
This is Tina.

801
01:23:06.943 --> 01:23:08.672
She's an old friend.

802
01:23:09.646 --> 01:23:12.672
Actually, we just met an hour ago.

803
01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:16.141
Yeah. It was like an hour and a half.

804
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.381
You got quite a charmer here.

805
01:23:20.824 --> 01:23:23.952
It hides inside its shell

806
01:23:24.127 --> 01:23:28.689
putting its head in the
shell and its arms and legs

807
01:23:29.666 --> 01:23:31.600
and its little tiny tail.

808
01:23:32.169 --> 01:23:35.730
And when the thing that's
scaring him goes like this,

809
01:23:36.873 --> 01:23:38.738
the turtle doesn't come out.

810
01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:44.006
So, the thing that scares
the turtle goes away

811
01:23:44.147 --> 01:23:45.910
'cause it thinks it's a rock.

812
01:23:46.049 --> 01:23:47.846
- You are a smart girl.
- Happy birthday.

813
01:23:47.984 --> 01:23:49.383
Yes, you are.

814
01:23:52.289 --> 01:23:54.849
- Be careful.
- Everyone needs some reassurance.

815
01:23:55.025 --> 01:23:56.515
Everyone's different, Dad, you know.

816
01:23:56.693 --> 01:23:58.718
- Stop playing with your cake.
- What do you mean?

817
01:23:58.895 --> 01:24:04.162
I just think it's necessary that
everybody has someone to listen to them.

818
01:24:04.301 --> 01:24:08.795
Right, you know, these days they
need therapy if they stub their toe.

819
01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:12.431
These guys are Marines.
They're trained for it.

820
01:24:13.243 --> 01:24:16.440
They're Marines, but
they're still people,

821
01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:22.485
and I don't think that anybody
is trained to shoot somebody.

822
01:24:22.619 --> 01:24:23.779
What do you think they are trained for?

823
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.914
I think that they're... What?
They're trained to use deadly force...

824
01:24:29.359 --> 01:24:31.327
- Trained to kill.... but
nobody can really be trained

825
01:24:31.494 --> 01:24:32.859
to watch someone die.

826
01:24:32.996 --> 01:24:36.693
That's just something
that you're not taught.

827
01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:37.822
Hey.

828
01:24:40.937 --> 01:24:44.873
Isabelle, let it go.

829
01:24:45.008 --> 01:24:46.839
Please. Thank you.

830
01:24:47.844 --> 01:24:49.505
So, what do you do?

831
01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:53.174
- I'm going to be a nurse.
- Hey!

832
01:24:53.316 --> 01:24:56.285
- I'm in nursing school.
- Give it. Give it.

833
01:24:56.419 --> 01:24:58.216
- Dad?
- Isabelle.

834
01:24:59.489 --> 01:25:01.013
That's my kitty.

835
01:25:01.191 --> 01:25:03.591
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a nurse, sir.

836
01:25:04.294 --> 01:25:06.728
- Need a nurse?
- Let you know if I do.

837
01:25:06.863 --> 01:25:08.694
Maggie gets everything.

838
01:25:09.499 --> 01:25:12.400
- She got the best doll.
- It's her birthday, honey.

839
01:25:12.535 --> 01:25:15.663
I didn't get anything that
I wanted on my birthday.

840
01:25:17.073 --> 01:25:19.507
And you were in stupid Afghanistan.

841
01:25:24.848 --> 01:25:27.316
Nursing. How's nursing
been for you, Tina?

842
01:25:27.450 --> 01:25:29.247
It's been a challenge.

843
01:25:29.753 --> 01:25:33.314
My stepfather actually encouraged me.

844
01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:36.052
Where did you grow up, Tina?

845
01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:40.061
Just 20 miles south. Actually,
I've never really left.

846
01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:42.858
So... I'm gonna change that, though.

847
01:25:43.233 --> 01:25:45.030
I'm living at home right now which...

848
01:25:45.168 --> 01:25:48.604
It's kind of my home because nobody
else is really there most of the time,

849
01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:53.903
which is good, it helps me
save money for school and stuff.

850
01:25:54.044 --> 01:25:56.376
- RN?
- An RN, yeah.

851
01:25:57.847 --> 01:26:00.509
I have another year to go,
but hopefully my grades...

852
01:26:00.650 --> 01:26:02.709
Isabelle, we're trying to
listen to our guest, all right?

853
01:26:02.852 --> 01:26:04.877
So you're in eight-hour
shifts, 12-hour...

854
01:26:05.021 --> 01:26:09.856
Now I am praying for 12-hour
shifts. I have to get...

855
01:26:09.993 --> 01:26:12.826
Student loans are killing me.

856
01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:15.560
I don't know how anyone
does it. How did you do it?

857
01:26:15.699 --> 01:26:16.893
Isabelle.

858
01:26:21.071 --> 01:26:22.129
Stop it.

859
01:26:22.272 --> 01:26:24.035
What got you into it?

860
01:26:24.541 --> 01:26:28.568
I genuinely like people and I love...

861
01:26:28.878 --> 01:26:30.971
I might as well like it.

862
01:26:31.147 --> 01:26:32.239
Enough!

863
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.411
Couldn't you just stay dead?

864
01:26:36.553 --> 01:26:37.520
Isabelle!

865
01:26:37.654 --> 01:26:40.589
You're just mad 'cause Mom would
rather sleep with Uncle Tommy than you.

866
01:26:40.757 --> 01:26:42.657
Isabelle! Why would you say that?

867
01:26:42.792 --> 01:26:45.090
Mom and Uncle Tommy
had sex all the time.

868
01:26:45.228 --> 01:26:46.354
Enough!

869
01:27:13.123 --> 01:27:14.715
Can I go home now?

870
01:27:16.025 --> 01:27:17.617
I wanna go to bed.

871
01:27:37.747 --> 01:27:39.078
Sorry, Mom.

872
01:27:45.922 --> 01:27:48.789
Why did you say that?
You know it's not true.

873
01:27:52.095 --> 01:27:53.653
I don't like Dad.

874
01:27:56.199 --> 01:28:00.431
I'd rather have Uncle
Tommy around instead of Dad.

875
01:28:02.071 --> 01:28:03.231
Me, too.

876
01:28:07.143 --> 01:28:09.304
Daddy's gonna be better, okay?

877
01:28:10.713 --> 01:28:12.874
- Really?
- Yeah.

878
01:28:15.652 --> 01:28:16.983
Thanks, Mom.

879
01:28:20.557 --> 01:28:24.118
- Mom, I love you.
- I love you, baby.

880
01:28:49.018 --> 01:28:52.249
Elsie, I don't know what he's gonna do.

881
01:28:55.658 --> 01:28:57.319
Where are you going?

882
01:28:59.996 --> 01:29:01.987
It's none of your damn
business, you know.

883
01:29:04.467 --> 01:29:06.662
Just stay the hell out of it.

884
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:10.130
You gotta call the police, Hank.

885
01:29:21.784 --> 01:29:23.217
What is that?

886
01:29:27.223 --> 01:29:29.817
- Where are the kids?
- In bed.

887
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:35.163
- They all tucked in?
- Yeah.

888
01:29:37.233 --> 01:29:38.825
Say their prayers?

889
01:29:41.971 --> 01:29:42.903
Good.

890
01:29:47.911 --> 01:29:48.935
Sam?

891
01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.569
Sam?

892
01:29:53.983 --> 01:29:56.417
What am I supposed to do now, Grace?

893
01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.740
- You know what I did to get back to you?
- No.

894
01:30:21.878 --> 01:30:25.336
You know what I did to
fucking get back to you?

895
01:30:25.848 --> 01:30:27.907
You fucking bitch!

896
01:30:30.119 --> 01:30:32.451
You know how he fucking suffered?

897
01:30:32.589 --> 01:30:34.921
He fucking suffered because of you!

898
01:30:35.091 --> 01:30:39.494
And what have you done to my fucking
house and my fucking kids, Grace?

899
01:30:39.662 --> 01:30:41.994
- You're fucking my brother.
- Sam, you know I didn't.

900
01:30:42.231 --> 01:30:44.995
You're fucking my brother
in my fucking house!

901
01:30:45.134 --> 01:30:46.897
- Sam, please.
- I love you, Grace!

902
01:30:47.036 --> 01:30:50.005
- Please, our girls, please.
- You know how much I love you?

903
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:55.309
You know what I... Grace,
do you know what I fucking...

904
01:30:56.179 --> 01:31:00.081
You know what I had to do with
these fucking hands, Grace?

905
01:31:00.516 --> 01:31:02.416
You... Fuck!

906
01:31:05.655 --> 01:31:07.850
God, fuck!

907
01:31:11.995 --> 01:31:13.895
What are you doing here?

908
01:31:29.445 --> 01:31:30.673
Come on, man.

909
01:31:46.829 --> 01:31:51.061
- Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.
- What are you fucking doing?

910
01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:52.292
Go to your room.

911
01:31:52.435 --> 01:31:54.460
- Fuck. What are you doing, Tommy?
- Okay.

912
01:31:54.604 --> 01:31:57.300
- What the fuck are you doing to me?
- Girls, lock the door.

913
01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:59.340
Behind my fucking back!

914
01:32:01.244 --> 01:32:03.144
- Did you call the cops?
- Hold on.

915
01:32:03.279 --> 01:32:06.043
- Did you call the fucking cops?
- All right. All right. All right.

916
01:32:20.029 --> 01:32:21.894
Is there a disturbance?

917
01:32:25.601 --> 01:32:27.000
Hold back.

918
01:32:27.136 --> 01:32:28.398
What are you doing here?

919
01:32:28.538 --> 01:32:30.028
- Drop your weapon.
- What are you doing?

920
01:32:30.173 --> 01:32:32.971
- Hold on. Put your gun down.
- Tommy, go back in the house.

921
01:32:33.109 --> 01:32:36.306
- What are you doing, huh?
- Put your weapon down, Captain.

922
01:32:36.446 --> 01:32:37.378
You know me?

923
01:32:37.513 --> 01:32:38.775
- Just shut up for a second, okay?
- You know me, huh?

924
01:32:38.915 --> 01:32:41.110
- I know your father, sir.
- Stay back!

925
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:43.480
- Stay back!
- All right. All right. All right.

926
01:32:43.619 --> 01:32:46.110
- You're a war hero, sir.
- I'm no fucking hero!

927
01:32:46.255 --> 01:32:48.723
I'm no fucking hero!
You know what I've done?

928
01:32:48.891 --> 01:32:51.189
- Hey, it's all right. Sam!
- Just relax.

929
01:32:51.327 --> 01:32:52.453
- Sam!
- Put the gun down, Sam.

930
01:32:52.628 --> 01:32:54.619
- Put the gun down.
- What are you gonna do?

931
01:32:54.797 --> 01:32:56.094
You gonna shoot me?

932
01:32:56.232 --> 01:32:57.460
- Put the gun down!
- Sam!

933
01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.364
- Fucking shoot me! Shoot me!
- Hold your fire. Nobody shoot!

934
01:33:00.503 --> 01:33:02.027
Shoot me! Come on!

935
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:06.005
Jesus, shut the fuck up! This
is a family matter. Shut up!

936
01:33:06.142 --> 01:33:07.541
Shut up. He's my brother.

937
01:33:07.677 --> 01:33:09.235
- Just stop for a second.
- Put the gun down, sir.

938
01:33:09.378 --> 01:33:12.370
- Just let me talk to him. He's my brother.
- Give him a minute.

939
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.252
- Sam!
- You are my brother, Sam!

940
01:33:22.225 --> 01:33:23.214
Sam!

941
01:33:32.802 --> 01:33:37.000
You're my brother. You're my family.

942
01:33:41.344 --> 01:33:42.811
Do you hear me?

943
01:33:45.448 --> 01:33:46.642
Sam!

944
01:34:04.467 --> 01:34:06.264
What's going on, Sam?

945
01:34:08.404 --> 01:34:10.099
I'm drowning, Tommy.

946
01:34:16.512 --> 01:34:18.537
Go. Go, go. Get on the ground!

947
01:34:18.981 --> 01:34:20.744
- Gun clear. Get down.
- Get on the ground now!

948
01:34:20.883 --> 01:34:22.077
Get down!

949
01:34:22.218 --> 01:34:24.186
- Give me your hand.
- Give me your hand.

950
01:34:26.823 --> 01:34:28.984
On your knees. On your knees.

951
01:34:31.694 --> 01:34:32.991
Get him up.

952
01:36:12.595 --> 01:36:14.187
My darling Grace,

953
01:36:16.132 --> 01:36:20.501
if you're reading this, it
means I didn't make it back.

954
01:36:22.705 --> 01:36:24.969
Nothing is certain in this life.

955
01:36:26.809 --> 01:36:32.247
The only thing I know for sure
is that I love you and our girls.

956
01:36:34.617 --> 01:36:36.744
That is the only thing I know.

957
01:36:46.228 --> 01:36:50.130
- Hello?
- Hey, Tommy. It's Sam.

958
01:36:50.766 --> 01:36:51.790
Hey.

959
01:36:56.472 --> 01:37:01.876
I was just thinking about you.

960
01:37:02.979 --> 01:37:06.005
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm good.

961
01:37:07.016 --> 01:37:10.179
Just calling. Yeah.

962
01:37:14.824 --> 01:37:16.758
You're my brother, Tommy.

963
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.508
When is your birthday, Uncle Tommy?

964
01:37:56.465 --> 01:37:59.798
Okay, sir. You know the drill.
We'll see you in about 30 minutes.

965
01:38:32.902 --> 01:38:34.631
Sam, tell me what happened.

966
01:38:42.845 --> 01:38:47.145
Sam, what happened?

967
01:38:50.953 --> 01:38:53.217
Why are you punishing yourself?

968
01:39:08.237 --> 01:39:10.899
I've loved you since I was 16 years old.

969
01:39:11.907 --> 01:39:13.340
You know that?

970
01:39:13.809 --> 01:39:17.802
If you don't tell me what happened,
you're not gonna see me again.

971
01:39:42.838 --> 01:39:44.237
I killed him.

972
01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:53.275
I killed Joe Willis.

973
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:10.531
I don't know who said, "Only the
dead have seen the end of war."

974
01:40:12.935 --> 01:40:14.960
I have seen the end of war.

975
01:40:17.673 --> 01:40:23.134
The question is, can I live again?
