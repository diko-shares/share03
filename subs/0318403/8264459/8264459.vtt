00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.578
<i>What's on the menu?</i>

2
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:42.833
<i>It could be ceviche, stinky-oo
It's Pumbaa</i>

3
00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:49.214
I gotta tell you, Timon.
That song always gets me right here.

4
00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:53.844
Yeah, Pumbaa.
Well, enough of that.

5
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.181
Timon, what are you doing?

6
00:00:57.265 --> 00:00:59.767
I'm fast-forwarding to where we come in.

7
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.394
But you can't go out of order.

8
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.482
Au contraire, my porcine pal.
I've got the remote.

9
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.651
But everyone's gonna get confused.

10
00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.821
We gotta go back
to the beginning of the story.

11
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.657
We're not in the beginning.

12
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.827
Yes, we were. The whole time.

13
00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.455
They don't know that.

14
00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.707
Why don't we tell them <i>our</i> story?

15
00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:30.005
I've got an idea.
Why don't we tell them our story?

16
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.382
I like the sound of that.

17
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.510
A little backstage tour.

18
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:40.057
Take them behind the scenes for a look
at the story within the story.

19
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.228
They don't know how we were there,
even though they didn't know.

20
00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:46.313
Couldn't have said it better.

21
00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.149
So we're going back to the beginning?

22
00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.195
No, Pumbaa, we're going way back

23
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.614
to before the beginning.

24
00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.754
Pride Rock.

25
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.091
So majestic.

26
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.969
So powerful.

27
00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.264
So bizarrely named.

28
00:02:20.348 --> 00:02:23.725
How can a rock be proud?
It's a rock.

29
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.354
It's because a pride
is what they call a group of lions.

30
00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:31.942
Sure, the lions get Pride Rock.
What about us meerkats?

31
00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:35.320
Where I come from,
we had nothing to be proud of.

32
00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.742
<i>When I was a young meerkat</i>

33
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:45.038
<i>When he was a young meerkat</i>

34
00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:48.625
Thanks.

35
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.962
Maybe it'd be safer
if I show them where I came from.

36
00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:54.548
Oh, boy. Do we get to see
where you grew up?

37
00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:57.134
Yeah, but it ain't pretty.

38
00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:00.846
Please remain seated
while the camera is in motion.

39
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.566
Here we are.

40
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.987
From Pride Rock to the pit of shame.

41
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:20.157
We're so low on the food chain,
we're underground.

42
00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:24.912
But don't take my word for it. I'll just
let my fellow meerkats do the talking.

Timon.

70
00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:37.150
Excuse me, have you seen my son?
Has he been here?

71
00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.319
Timon.

72
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.200
Uncle Max?
Relax. Have you seen Timon?

73
00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.578
No, I haven't, and what a day it's been.

74
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:53.542
No fractures, lacerations, concussions,
contusions, or injuries of any sort.

75
00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:58.171
As a matter of fact, there's no sign
of Timon's handiwork anywhere.

76
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.432
That would be...

77
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.600
Timon!

78
00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:18.358
- Hey, everybody.
- Nice work, Timon.

79
00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.527
Way to go, Tunnel Klutz.

80
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.323
- Who else could break a hole?
- Four in one week. A new record.

81
00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.991
Not again.

82
00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.660
What? It's called a skylight.

83
00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:39.254
Isn't that creative?
A skylight.

84
00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:44.009
I'll just have a word with him.

85
00:05:44.093 --> 00:05:48.221
I was just trying to shed a little light
on our pathetic existence.

86
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:51.933
Timon, this can't go on.

87
00:05:52.018 --> 00:05:57.356
Just this month, you've pulled down four
walls and collapsed two tunnel exits.

88
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.860
We have to look after each other.
Our survival depends on it.

89
00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:06.573
What's the point? All we do is dig
so we can hide, and hide so we can dig.

90
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.411
I want to be where
we don't have to dig tunnels

91
00:06:11.496 --> 00:06:14.039
and live with our heads
stuck in the sand.

92
00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:17.292
What's so bad about
dreaming of a better home?

93
00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:21.588
I want to show you something.
Look, Timon.

94
00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.675
Go on, look.

95
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.804
Look out to the horizon.

96
00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.390
Past the trees.

97
00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:34.643
Over the grasslands.

98
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.229
Everything the light touches

99
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.442
belongs to someone else.

100
00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:46.113
I thought you were going
a different direction with this.

101
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:50.450
- What can I say? It's nature's design.
- We're other animals' food.

102
00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:54.329
A moveable feast,
feared by no one and eaten by all.

103
00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:59.584
But when they die, they become
the grass, and we eat the grass, right?

104
00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.838
No. We can't digest grass.
We're grass-intolerant.

105
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.966
OK, Max. Thank you.
You've been a big help.

106
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.554
- Meerkat, it's what's for dinner.
- Thank you, Uncle Max.

107
00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:15.809
I think Uncle Max dislodged
one too many rocks with his skull.

108
00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:23.316
But he's right, Timon. I just know
there's a way for you to fit in here.

109
00:07:27.738 --> 00:07:30.240
All right, who's on sentry duty?

110
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.619
That's it. My son, on sentry duty.

111
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.330
"Timon, the Sentry."

112
00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:41.835
Timon the sentry? Why not save
the hyenas the trouble and kill me now?

113
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.713
- Kill me now.
- He has a point.

114
00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:48.633
All you have to do is watch for hyenas,
and yell if you see one.

115
00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.427
Look at Iron Joe.

116
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:52.554
Don't close your eyes.

117
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:56.683
Somebody's gotta guard us.
Somebody's gotta protect us.

118
00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.437
Now I'm convinced.

119
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:04.733
It's outside, up in the breeze,
under the wide open sky.

120
00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:09.196
Isn't that what you want? Maybe you'd
rather have him on the digging crew?

121
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.781
No.

122
00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:17.162
Good. Then we all agree.
Timon, listen to Uncle Max.

123
00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:22.125
He'll teach you what you need to know.
Honey, try to make this one work.

124
00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:30.926
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

125
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.972
Good.
What do we do if we see a hyena?

126
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:37.641
Scream, "Mommy."

127
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.269
That's right, mister.
The world is fraught with danger.

128
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:45.023
- Fraught, I tell you.
- Oh, boy. It's the fraught-fest.

129
00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:47.901
- ...rip us limb from limb.
- Bravo, Uncle Max.

130
00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:49.986
Way to sell it to the cheap seats.

131
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:54.324
Applaud now, but try clapping
when you don't have any hands.

132
00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:00.747
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

133
00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.345

This is no time for horseplay. You're
supposed to be up there looking for...

Hyenas.

164
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.174

165
00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:20.178

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.347
Scrambled.

167
00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.308
And a little bit runny.

168
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.239
Get in here.
What are you, a meshuggeneh?

169
00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:48.665
- Stumpy? Flinchy? Swifty?
- Here.

170
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:53.086
What a relief. Everybody's...
Where's Uncle Max?

171
00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:01.469
- Run for your life.
- Play dead.

172
00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.555
You're almost there.

173
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:06.182
Suede is the look for this fall...

174
00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:09.686
What's going on?
Pumbaa, you're sitting on the remote.

175
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.398
Sorry, I thought it was a brownie.

176
00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:15.942
You've got it, Max.

177
00:12:24.535 --> 00:12:27.370
I flinched when I should've scurried.

178
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.458
It just never gets old, does it?

179
00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:33.752
The classics never do, honey.

180
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:44.512
I guess I owe everyone an apology.

181
00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.433
All right, so I made a teensy mistake.

182
00:12:48.517 --> 00:12:52.145
Like we all haven't broken into song
on sentry duty before.

183
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.148
Let me have a show of hands.

184
00:12:56.066 --> 00:12:58.151
OK.

185
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:06.868
Maybe it's a little too soon, but I'm
sure we'll all laugh about this someday.

186
00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:09.454
Trust me.

187
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:11.706
I did trust you.

188
00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:17.086
But...

189
00:13:56.627 --> 00:13:58.378
Sweetie...

190
00:13:58.462 --> 00:14:03.049
I'm never gonna fit in here.
Nobody even likes me.

191
00:14:03.133 --> 00:14:07.220
- Sure they do, honey.
- Besides you, Ma.

192
00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:09.848
Besides me. There's...

193
00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:13.101
I have to find my place,
but it isn't here.

194
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:16.187
Yes, it is.
We just haven't found it yet.

195
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:20.191
- But we will. Here's an idea...
- Stop with the hair already.

196
00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.527
My place is out there, Ma.

197
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:27.740
I may not know exactly where
or how far, but I gotta go.

198
00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.118
- No, wait. If we just...
- Ma.

199
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.300
I hope you find
what you're looking for, honey.

200
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.265
I love you.

201
00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:03.985
My Timmy.

202
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:08.823
Mom. Choking. Not breathing.

203
00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.747
And people wonder why I have issues.

204
00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:19.083
I'll be OK.

205
00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.544
I know you will.

206
00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:40.229
- Be careful.
- I will.

207
00:15:42.024 --> 00:15:46.277
- Don't talk to strangers.
- I know.

208
00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:50.531
Remember, wash behind your ears.

209
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.242
Ma, I'm not a kid anymore.

210
00:15:54.578 --> 00:15:57.997
- Never go swimming without a buddy.
- Got it.

211
00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:10.635
- What?
- I said...

212
00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:13.221
Goodbye, Ma.

213
00:16:36.453 --> 00:16:41.290
And so, with high spirits,
I boldly ventured off

214
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:44.836
where no meerkat had dared to go before.

215
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.298
I put my past behind me,
and never looked back.

216
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.516
Mommy.

217
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:03.271
What am I doing?

218
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.150
Which way should I go?

219
00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.569
That depends on what you seek.

220
00:17:09.653 --> 00:17:13.448
How convenient.
Enter omniscient monkey, right on cue.

221
00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.491
You know what they say.

222
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:18.745
When the student is ready,
the teacher appears.

223
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.998
That's it.
No more fortune cookies for you.

224
00:17:22.082 --> 00:17:24.000
Where'd you come from?

225
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.420
The better question is,
where are you going?

226
00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:33.259
Someplace wonderful, mister.
Where...

227
00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:36.345
You didn't catch the song
I sang a few minutes ago?

228
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.972
I didn't have the pleasure.

229
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:42.518
To recap, I want to live
in some beautiful place, outside.

230
00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:45.772
A carefree place where
I don't have to hide or worry.

231
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.068
A life without worry.

232
00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.153
You seek <i>Hakuna Matata</i>.

233
00:17:52.237 --> 00:17:56.407
- Harpoon a tomata?
- <i>Hakuna Matata</i>. It means "no worries."

234
00:17:56.492 --> 00:18:00.411
Perfect. Mind taking that stick of yours
and drawing me a map?

235
00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.835
To find it, you must look
beyond what you see.

236
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:14.008
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means look beyond what you see.

237
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.762
Beyond what I see.

238
00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:21.641
Get a load of the monkey
getting all existential on me.

239
00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:24.685
Beyond what I see.

240
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:45.456
It's kind of hard to think
with all this music.

241
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.127
Beyond what I see.

242
00:18:50.212 --> 00:18:53.381
Wait a second.
It's coming to me.

243
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.718
It's that slug I ate
or I'm having an epiphany.

244
00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:04.725
I'm going to the Big Pointy Rock.

245
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.894
Right?

246
00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:10.565
Who was that strange monkey?

247
00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:14.610
Dream home, here I come.

248
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.917
Hello?
Strange but wise monkey?

249
00:19:58.405 --> 00:20:01.449
You know, first impressions
are very important.

250
00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:03.659
I thought you were a scream.

251
00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:10.041
Just eat me now. Please make it fast.
I got a low threshold for pain.

252
00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:14.003
Easy there, little guy.
I'm not going to eat you.

253
00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:16.547
What?
You're not?

254
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.883
Then why were you stalking me?

255
00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:24.263
I saw you go by and I figured a little
fella like you shouldn't be out alone.

256
00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:27.099
What about you?
You're all alone.

257
00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:30.269
You are all alone, aren't you?

258
00:20:30.354 --> 00:20:34.482
Yeah. Most animals give me
a pretty wide berth.

259
00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:37.526
They do?
Even the hungry ones?

260
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.238
Yeah. I drive almost everyone away.

261
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.032
People see me coming
and they run for cover.

262
00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.618
They can't get out
of the way fast enough.

263
00:20:45.702 --> 00:20:47.703
You don't say.

264
00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:52.667
Must be the gleam on those vicious
tusks. Strikes fear into their hearts.

265
00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:56.087
Actually, they say
I wreck their appetite.

266
00:20:56.171 --> 00:21:00.174
It's like you have this
special power.

267
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:05.846
Special power?
It's pretty powerful, all right.

268
00:21:05.931 --> 00:21:09.850
- Perfect. You're hired.
- Great. For what?

269
00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:15.898
To get me to a little worry-free haven
out by that big, pointy rock.

270
00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:18.943
And you want me to come with you?

271
00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:22.947
Do you see any other big loveable
chunk of warthog here

272
00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:27.118
who also has razor-sharp tusks
and the ability to repel predators?

273
00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:32.206
- I'm your pig.
- I can tell we see eye to eye.

274
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:34.917
You mean, like friends?

275
00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:40.631
Easy there, big fella.
I'd say more like acquaintances.

276
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.261
- Well, it's a start.
- Put her there, acquaintance.

277
00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:47.805
- I'm Timon.
- Pumbaa.

278
00:21:47.889 --> 00:21:49.974
No, really.

279
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.562
All right, then.
Let's hit the road.

280
00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:59.066
You got it, acquaintance.

281
00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.152
So, clear up one thing for me.

282
00:22:01.236 --> 00:22:05.197
If you weren't going to eat me,
what kind of a wacky pig are you?

283
00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.200
I'm an insectivore.

284
00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:13.039
A bug eater. Me, too.
I just never had a name for it.

285
00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:16.917
I'm partial to the crawly critters.
How about you, big boy?

286
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.795
I prefer the ones with wings.

287
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.383
This could be the start
of a beautiful acquaintanceship.

288
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:42.818
So, now we're back at the beginning.
Right, Timon?

289
00:22:42.903 --> 00:22:44.987
You got that right, pally.

290
00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.617
At last, things were looking up.

291
00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:54.955
I had the sun on my shoulders, the wind
at my heels, a song in my heart.

292
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:05.424
And to protect me,
a great big fat guy.

293
00:23:06.093 --> 00:23:08.803
You really think I look fat?

294
00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:12.515
Pumbaa. You're a pig.
It's a compliment.

295
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:15.101
Thank you.

296
00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:23.734
<i>♪ It's the circle of life ♪</i>

297
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.446
<i>♪ And it moves us all ♪</i>

298
00:23:27.531 --> 00:23:29.907
There it is. The Big Pointy Rock.

299
00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:33.244
We're almost there.

300
00:23:36.081 --> 00:23:39.250
- I think we're a little late.
- It's a land rush.

301
00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:43.587
That loudmouth monkey. He must've
blabbed it to the whole world.

302
00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:48.259
- What exactly did he say?
- "Look beyond what you see."

303
00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:50.928
Maybe you should
look beyond the rock.

304
00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:55.474
Maybe I should
look beyond the rock.

305
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:59.770
Let's have a little look, shall we?
Beyond what I see.

306
00:24:07.487 --> 00:24:11.323
What do you know? The monkey's got
an eagle eye for real estate.

307
00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:13.617
Timon, look.

308
00:24:13.702 --> 00:24:16.620
- It's the monkey.
- What's he holding up?

309
00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:21.500
Who cares? It's not important.
Come on. My dream home awaits.

310
00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:29.550
I don't do so well in crowds.
Maybe we better go around.

311
00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:34.138
The shortest distance between me
and my dream home is a straight line.

312
00:24:34.222 --> 00:24:36.432
Follow me.

313
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:39.768
- Excuse me.
- Goodness.

314
00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:41.854
Make room.

315
00:24:41.938 --> 00:24:43.814
Watch it, Twiggy.

316
00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:45.983
I'm walkin' here.

317
00:24:57.871 --> 00:25:01.874
Timon.
There's something I gotta tell you.

318
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:06.462
Pumbaa. We'll have plenty of time
to chat once we settle in.

319
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.924
I could really use a rest stop.

320
00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:12.551
Don't worry.
You'll get your second wind.

321
00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:16.472
I got a really bad feeling.

322
00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:19.600
It'll pass.
Trust me. It'll pass.

323
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:32.655
- Look, the rhinos are bowing.
- We'd better bow, too.

324
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:45.793
Look, sire, how they kneel
before the royal son.

325
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:58.597
That's your special power?
What a weapon.

326
00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:01.016
You mean, you don't mind?

327
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:04.019
Are you kidding?
It was a gas.

328
00:26:05.772 --> 00:26:08.399
I don't like to toot my own horn.

329
00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:10.901
That's probably for the best.

330
00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:15.281
- Let's go, Pumbaa.
- Lead the way.

331
00:26:24.374 --> 00:26:28.294
This is it, buddy boy.
Home, sweet home.

332
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:33.549
- I don't got to share it with anybody.
- Don't you get lonely out here?

333
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:36.010
Lonely? Try "commitment free".

334
00:26:36.094 --> 00:26:39.847
The elbow-to-elbow life
reminds me a little too much of home.

335
00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:44.226
This place has everything.
Cool refreshments, cozy little hammock,

336
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:48.022
a lovely water feature,
and it's all mine.

337
00:26:51.443 --> 00:26:55.571
It's really coming together,
Timon, so...

338
00:26:55.655 --> 00:26:58.616
So I guess I'll just be going.

339
00:27:03.079 --> 00:27:05.414
Wait a minute now.

340
00:27:05.498 --> 00:27:08.250
There's no law that says you have to go.

341
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:12.004
- I mean, if you want...
- Great. I already made up two beds.

342
00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:15.924
One for you, and one for me.

343
00:27:25.393 --> 00:27:28.354
All this construction work
has me bushed.

344
00:27:28.438 --> 00:27:30.564
Think I'll turn in early.

345
00:27:54.422 --> 00:27:56.882
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

346
00:27:56.966 --> 00:27:59.051
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

347
00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:08.102
Home, sweet home indeed.

348
00:28:32.085 --> 00:28:34.503
Hey, keep it down up there.

349
00:28:34.587 --> 00:28:37.047
We have neighbors?
We should say hello.

350
00:28:37.132 --> 00:28:40.467
Noisy neighbors.
There go the property values.

351
00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:45.222
<i>♪ Let's hear it in the herd ♪

354
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:58.736
Perfect. We moved to the theatre
district. Get a load of these guys.

355
00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:00.904
Knock it off.

356
00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:04.158
<i>♪ Just can't wait... ♪</i>

357
00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:06.243
Look out.

358
00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:10.497
<i>♪ To be king ♪</i>

359
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.711
I'm OK.

360
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:19.047
Show people.

361
00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:24.428
Chin up, Pumbaa. Our dream home's
around here somewhere.

362
00:29:24.512 --> 00:29:29.099
I once came across a place that might be
just what you're looking for.

363
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:34.855
Spectacular waterfalls, set in a lush
tropical oasis, a scrumptious array...

364
00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:39.860
Forget it. I'm a realist, and I'm not
gonna go chasing after some fantasy.

365
00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.029
I'm going beyond what I see.

366
00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:45.741
If you go beyond what you see,
how do you know when you're there?

367
00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:48.494
I'll tell you how I know.
We're there.

368
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:58.670
This is a lovely spot.
Rustic, picturesque.

369
00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:00.839
Home, sweet home.

370
00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:12.059
Sure, it needs a little work,
but it's got good bones.

371
00:30:12.936 --> 00:30:19.024
This is an elephant graveyard. Who'd
ever come to an elephant graveyard?

372
00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:23.654
Sire, the hyenas are after the children.

373
00:30:27.158 --> 00:30:29.284
I see carnivores.

374
00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:33.330
Beyond what you see.

375
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:39.711
Would this be a bad time to bring up
that little place I told you about?

376
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:42.923
This is home, sweet home, baby.

377
00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:45.467
Home...

378
00:30:45.552 --> 00:30:48.470
Steam. Steam is good.

379
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:54.142
Steam is water. Gotta have water.
You know, for the dream home.

380
00:30:54.227 --> 00:30:57.396
Steam home, dream home.

381
00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:01.149
I am perfectly happy right here.

382
00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:04.987
It's remote, private,
no unexpected visitors.

383
00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:16.373
Something tells me this ain't
the travelling company of "Riverdance".

384
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:23.714
Beyond what you see.

385
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.512
How am I supposed to look beyond
what I see beyond that?

386
00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.224
Sorry.

387
00:31:39.939 --> 00:31:42.316
What this place lacks
in water and shade,

388
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.652
it makes up for with searing heat
and blinding sunshine.

389
00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:47.863
Home, sweet home, Pumbaa.

390
00:31:55.163 --> 00:31:58.373
- Shall we run for our lives?
- Oh, yes, let's.

391
00:32:17.018 --> 00:32:19.102
Hang on, Timon.

392
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:22.773
This is it.
Goodbye, cruel world.

393
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:37.120
That's it? That wasn't so bad.

394
00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:40.499
You can't knock old Timon down
that easy.

395
00:32:40.583 --> 00:32:42.876
Yeah, bring it on.

396
00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:48.382
Pumbaa? Question.

397
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:51.301
Is it possible to fall off
the edge of the Earth?

398
00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:57.557
Technically, no. The Earth is round like
a sphere, so it doesn't have an edge.

399
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:09.111
- Mind if I pause it for a second?
- Go ahead.

400
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.279
Be right back.

401

405
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.861
I got the jumbo so we could share.

406
00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:56.658
- Were you just picking your nose?
- No, I had an itch on the inside.

407
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:30.484
- Timon, you OK?
- I give up.

408
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:34.321
But you can't give up.
We still haven't found our dream home.

409
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.573
Forget it, Pumbaa.

410
00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:39.534
I've been dragging you down long enough.

411
00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:43.413
I'm going home,
and I suggest you do the same.

412
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:47.918
I would if I could, but I can't.

413
00:34:48.002 --> 00:34:50.837
Sure you can, buddy.
I won't stop you.

414
00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:53.673
No, I mean I don't have a home.

415
00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:57.010
You don't? What happened?
Are you lost?

416
00:34:58.012 --> 00:35:01.098
No place good enough for you?

417
00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:04.476
You're all alone
in this big empty world?

418
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:21.284
Truth is,
I'm all alone, too.

419
00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.209
Pumbaa, you're the only friend
I've ever had.

420
00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:32.379
- You mean...
- Yeah, Pumbaa.

421
00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:34.923
And friends stick together to the end.

422
00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.523
Timon, are you crying?

423
00:35:51.607 --> 00:35:54.025
I'm fine.

424
00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:57.988
I just have something in my eye.

425
00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:00.157
Here, blow.

426
00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:07.247
- Here, Pumbaa.
- Thanks!

427
00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:09.624
OK, I'm better.

428
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:40.614
Too bad we never found
that perfect place.

429
00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:46.912
- Why'd we listen to that stupid monkey?
- Maybe you're giving up too soon.

430
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:49.080
Beyond what you see.

431
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.461
Remember that place I told you about?

432
00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:58.340
Forget about your place.
Get a load of what I found.

433
00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:02.093
Talk about "beyond what you see".

434
00:37:02.178 --> 00:37:04.471
This is our dream home.

435
00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.349
Dramatic views.

436
00:37:08.184 --> 00:37:10.310
Your very own porch swing.

437
00:37:10.937 --> 00:37:12.646
Hot tub and spa.

438
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.398
Well-stocked cupboard.

439
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:17.609
Let's celebrate.

440
00:37:17.693 --> 00:37:22.948
The monkey was right.
We found it. The perfect life.

441
00:37:23.032 --> 00:37:26.284
I'll just whip up a little something.

442
00:37:26.369 --> 00:37:28.787
He had the perfect name for it, too.

443
00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:30.705
Come and get it.

444
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.458
Such a wonderful phrase.
It had this rhythm.

445
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.796
Try this, hot tuna frittata.

446
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.298
- That's not it.
- The spinach armada.

447
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:43.260
- Quiet, I'm thinking.
- A spoon of ricotta.

448
00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.804
- Two words.
- Hookwormy piccata.

449
00:37:45.888 --> 00:37:48.431
- Six syllables.
- Kahuna colada.

450
00:37:48.516 --> 00:37:51.142
- 12 letters.
- A blue enchilada.

451
00:37:51.227 --> 00:37:53.395
- Rhymes with...
- Legumes on a platter.

452
00:37:53.479 --> 00:37:57.315
This oughta be hotter.
I got to lambada.

453
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.112
How can you dance at a time like this?
I'm dying here.

454
00:38:03.364 --> 00:38:07.284
- Sorry about that, pal.
- <i>Hakuna Matata</i>.

455
00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:11.705
- Come again?
- <i>Hakuna Matata</i>. It means "no worries."

456
00:38:19.588 --> 00:38:23.466
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's do a sing-along.

457
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:28.096
You tease.
I love karaoke. I'm there.

Pumbaa, where's the grub?

466
00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:55.999
You just can't help yourself, can you?

467
00:38:56.083 --> 00:38:58.043
Sorry.

468
00:38:58.127 --> 00:39:01.087

00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:42.462
- It means "no worries."
- I see.

478
00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:46.424
So, I told the boy
"To find <i>Hakuna Matata</i>,

479
00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:49.386
you must look beyond what you see."

480
00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:54.766
- A metaphor.
- Actually, it's not a...

481
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.560
You used a metaphor on Timon?

482
00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.979
He takes things literally.

483
00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:03.483
That's it. He's starving out there.
I just know it.

484
00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:08.154
Max, Timon's out there chasing
metaphors. I've got to go find him.

485
00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:11.950
- Are you nuts?
- Nice to have a supportive family.

486
00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:13.993
Well, here I go.

487
00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:18.748
Remember, the journey of a thousand
miles begins with the first step.

488
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.167
Thanks. Here's my first step.

489
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:31.094
Guess bowling for porcupines
wasn't the best idea.

490
00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:35.765
Yeah. Got to be right up there
with bobbing for snapping turtles.

491
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.476
That's going to leave a mark.

492
00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.148
Look, Timon, buzzards.
What do you say, one more round?

493
00:40:43.232 --> 00:40:46.443
There must be some part of me
we haven't injured yet.

494
00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:48.611
Please.

495
00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:52.949
No, I'm beat. You go ahead.
I'm calling it a day.

496
00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:56.369
But it's no fun alone.

497
00:41:02.835 --> 00:41:07.213
Why not?
One more run won't change our lives.

498
00:41:09.592 --> 00:41:13.261
Who knows why fate led us
to little Simba that day?

499
00:41:13.345 --> 00:41:15.763
Maybe it was just
my love of adventure,

500
00:41:15.848 --> 00:41:19.976
or my innate courage,
my valiant and fearless way of...

501
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.770
OK, who's in charge
of the freeze frames?

502
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:25.190
- Sorry.
- Any who...

503
00:41:25.983 --> 00:41:28.193
Rescuing Simba was a cinch.

504
00:41:28.277 --> 00:41:31.112
Then came the really scary part.

505
00:41:33.616 --> 00:41:35.700
Parenthood.

506
00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.921
Timon.

507
00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:53.968
- I got to go.
- Go? Go where?

508
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:58.848
- You know. Go. Bad.
- Why didn't you say so? Let's go.

509
00:41:58.933 --> 00:42:01.434
When you got to go,
you got to go.

510
00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:04.020
Young lion, get down from there.

511
00:42:05.648 --> 00:42:08.900
All right.
You guys look like ants down there.

512
00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:10.944
I'm counting to three.

513
00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:18.785
One, two...

514
00:42:19.787 --> 00:42:21.663
Three.

515
00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:26.000
- Timon.
- Again?

516
00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:27.919
No. I'm thirsty.

517
00:42:28.003 --> 00:42:31.506
This means you'll be up again
about two hours from now.

518
00:42:36.011 --> 00:42:39.264
Hang on, Simba. I'll save you.

519
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.938
Timon?

520
00:42:47.022 --> 00:42:49.941
I'm going to get old
walking across this thing.

521
00:42:54.613 --> 00:42:56.281
Timon?

522
00:42:56.365 --> 00:43:00.702
What have you got against the concept
of a good night's sleep?

523
00:43:00.786 --> 00:43:05.206
Actually, I had a bad dream.

524
00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:08.251
Oh, well...

525
00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:13.298
- It wasn't me.
- Junior had a bad dream.

526
00:43:15.801 --> 00:43:18.469
Why don't you sleep over here with us?

527
00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.888
Mi Pumbaa, su Pumbaa.

528
00:43:20.973 --> 00:43:22.348
All right!

529
00:43:25.561 --> 00:43:27.645
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

530
00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.148
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

531
00:44:48.727 --> 00:44:53.731
Watch where you aim that morning breath.
It should come with a warning label.

532
00:44:53.816 --> 00:44:55.817
What a wake-up call.

533
00:44:55.901 --> 00:44:59.112
Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the warthog.

534
00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:03.157
What's the matter, Pops?
Had a little too much <i>Hakuna Matata</i>?

535
00:45:03.242 --> 00:45:06.494
Sonny boy, I invented <i>Hakuna Matata</i>.

536
00:45:06.578 --> 00:45:09.080
Oh, yeah? Well, I perfected it.

537
00:45:09.164 --> 00:45:11.332
Sure you did.

538
00:45:11.417 --> 00:45:16.003
Pumbaa, who holds the record
for the world's longest bug belch?

539
00:45:16.088 --> 00:45:18.548
That would be Simba.

540
00:45:18.632 --> 00:45:21.843
All right, who's the champion
at slug swallowing?

541
00:45:21.927 --> 00:45:25.763
- Simba again.
- Cricket crunching? Grub gulping?

542
00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:28.266
Maggot munching?
Snail slurping?

543
00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:32.603
Nobody. We never had
a snail-eating contest before.

544
00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:50.037
I don't think this is such a good idea.

545
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.132
I told you this wasn't
such a good idea.

546
00:47:04.279 --> 00:47:07.990
Thus did the pupil surpass the teacher.

547
00:47:08.075 --> 00:47:12.745
You've been hanging around with
the monkey again, haven't you?

548
00:47:20.295 --> 00:47:22.839
Our Simba is growing up.

549
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:32.807
<i>♪ Is this the little boy ♪

550

558

So, that's why
they call it a dung beetle.

559
00:48:20.647 --> 00:48:23.065
You don't say.
And yet still so tasty.

560
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.985
Yeah, and they're my favorite, too.

561
00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.956
Just what the doctor ordered.

562
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:43.628
After a long day of doing nothing,
it's good to kick back.

563
00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:48.007
Three pals and no worries.
What more could you want?

564
00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.938
I'm bushed.

565
00:49:02.022 --> 00:49:04.732
Think I'll turn in for the night.

566
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.618
- I'm out.
- Right behind you.

567
00:49:18.914 --> 00:49:21.248
You're killing me.

568
00:49:23.877 --> 00:49:27.213
Timon, it's your turn
to say good night.

569
00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.966
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

570
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:32.093
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

571
00:49:57.369 --> 00:50:01.414
You got to admit, we had a pretty
good thing going there.

572
00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.417
We could've gone on like that forever.

573
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:09.005
Except for one teeny-weeny little thing
we forgot to count on.

574
00:50:12.009 --> 00:50:14.677
Nala?

575
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:17.805
How did you...

576
00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:21.559
This is a disaster, Pumbaa.
A disaster, I tell you.

577
00:50:21.643 --> 00:50:24.228
Because they've finally
found each other,

578
00:50:24.312 --> 00:50:28.399
like two soul mates joined across
the years by the bonds of true love?

579
00:50:28.483 --> 00:50:30.484
Sweet, innocent little Pumbaa.

580
00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:34.864
She'll put a stake right through
the heart of our <i>Hakuna Matata</i>.

581
00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:37.575
Then I guess we ought to do something.

582
00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:39.994
And I know just what it is.

583
00:50:40.078 --> 00:50:44.582
Pumbaa, we can't let them
feel the love tonight.

584
00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:35.341
<i>♪ Can you feel ♪
♪ The love tonight? ♪</i>

585
00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.510

00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:33.858

590
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:37.903
Sarcasm is a foreign language
to you, isn't it? Look.

00:52:39.823 --> 00:52:41.907
<i>♪ Can you feel ♪</i>

592
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.243
She's making those eyes.

00:52:44.327 --> 00:52:46.579
He's smiling that smile.

594
00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.831
They're laughing.

595
00:52:48.915 --> 00:52:53.085

600
00:53:53.647 --> 00:53:58.400
That's it, buddy. We gave it
our best shot, but he's a goner.

601
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.029
Maybe not.

602
00:54:02.113 --> 00:54:05.741
- You never give up, do you?
- Look.

603
00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:09.036
- You don't know what I've been through.
- Then tell me.

604
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.372
- Forget it.
- Fine.

605
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:16.669
Pumbaa, do you know
what this means?

606
00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:20.339
He can't express his feelings
and she has commitment issues?

607
00:54:20.423 --> 00:54:23.008
We won. We split them up.

608
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:26.220
And that's a good thing?

609
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:34.061
He seems to be taking it kind of hard.

610
00:54:34.145 --> 00:54:36.438
I know. Poor guy.

611
00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:40.067
But it's the best thing for us.
I mean, for him.

612
00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:43.821
Let's go.
I think this storm's coming to a head.

613
00:54:45.782 --> 00:54:49.034
<i>Hakuna Matata</i> is safe at last, pal,

614
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:52.037
because nothing's going
to take our boy away now.

615
00:54:52.872 --> 00:54:55.207
He's gone?
What do you mean, he's gone?

616
00:54:55.292 --> 00:54:59.628
It's just like the baboon said:
"The king has returned."

617
00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:08.304
You want me to go over it again?

618
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:11.890
Yes, please, but be a dear
and skip to the part about Simba.

619
00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:14.643
Not that your childhood
wasn't fascinating.

620
00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:18.355
Simba's the rightful king,
but after he disappeared,

621
00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:22.067
Scar proclaimed himself king
and allied himself with the hyenas.

622
00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:27.906
Poor Simba. The treachery, the villainy,
the sheer indescribable horror.

623
00:55:29.576 --> 00:55:33.329
Why is she toying with us?
This crazy chick is going to eat us.

624
00:55:33.413 --> 00:55:38.417
Simba has to go home to challenge
his uncle and reclaim his place as king.

625
00:55:43.506 --> 00:55:45.507
Don't you get it?

626
00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:48.344
Simba needs us. Now.

627
00:55:49.512 --> 00:55:52.931
He needs us?
Then he shouldn't have left us.

628
00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:56.101
If he wants to run off
to be "His Highness",

629
00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:59.938
I say, "Don't let the branches hit you
on the way out."

630
00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:03.359
Leave <i>Hakuna Matata</i>
to someone who appreciates it.

631
00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:07.613
But it's not really <i>Hakuna Matata</i>
without Simba.

632
00:56:07.697 --> 00:56:10.366
What's gotten into you?
Not <i>Hakuna Matata</i>?

633
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:14.244
That's crazy talk, I tell you.
Nothing's changed here.

634
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:18.540
We had <i>Hakuna Matata</i> before Simba,
and we've still got it now.

635
00:56:18.625 --> 00:56:20.918
We got to go help our friend, Timon.

636
00:56:21.002 --> 00:56:22.920
Et tu, Рumbaa?

637
00:56:23.004 --> 00:56:26.090
You're just going to walk away,
give up on all this?

638
00:56:26.174 --> 00:56:29.885
What happened to
friends stick together to the end?

639
00:56:29.969 --> 00:56:33.639
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

640
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:45.234
I got everything
I ever wanted right here.

641
00:57:06.297 --> 00:57:09.591
This is more like it.
Elbow room.

642
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.234

You. No. Don't say a word.
I know what you're going to say.

"Did you find <i>Hakuna Matata</i>?"

651
00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:12.738
Yes, I did,
thank you very much.

652
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.907

653
00:58:16.075 --> 00:58:18.160
Deliriously happy.

"I see.
Happy, is it?"

655
00:58:21.706 --> 00:58:24.917
"If you're so happy,
why do you look so miserable?"

656
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:27.836
Miserable, you say?
Why should I be miserable?

657
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:32.341
I don't know. Maybe my two best pals
in the world deserted me.

658
00:58:32.425 --> 00:58:36.053
They've headed off
on some heroic mission.

659
00:58:37.138 --> 00:58:39.932
My friends are gone.

660
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:48.690
And my <i>Hakuna Matata</i> went with them.

661
00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:52.945
Would you mind?

662
00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:57.574
Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk.

663
00:58:59.911 --> 00:59:02.454
My work here is done.

664
00:59:41.869 --> 00:59:44.413

665
00:59:54.966 --> 00:59:58.010
What was with the running?
If you can call it that.

666
00:59:58.094 --> 01:00:01.221
I was giving you time to catch up.

667
01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.390
You big lug.

668
01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.187
Hop on, buddy.
We got a fight to catch.

669
01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.024
Let's whip some grass.

670
01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.985
This is the stuff of legends.

671
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:19.573
An epic struggle,
the place where heroes are born.

672
01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:22.743
Pumbaa, this could be our finest hour.

673
01:00:24.203 --> 01:00:25.329
<i>♪ Luau. ♪</i>

674
01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:29.583
<i>♪ Hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat? ♪
♪ Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because... ♪</i>

675
01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:32.669
- Let's just cut to the chase, shall we?
- Sure.

676
01:00:41.054 --> 01:00:43.138
What the...

677
01:00:52.857 --> 01:00:56.818
I love the smell of Pumbaa
in the morning.

678
01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.404
Move your tush, honey.

679
01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:02.199
- Ma? Uncle Max?
- Timmy.

680
01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:03.950
Timon?

681
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:07.204
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

682
01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:09.373
Mommy's here.

683
01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:13.168
Let me introduce my best friend.

684
01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:17.673
Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max.
Ma, Uncle Max, Pumbaa.

685
01:01:17.757 --> 01:01:21.510
Look, there's Simba,
and that must be his Uncle Scar.

686
01:01:21.594 --> 01:01:25.681
Good, they're talking things out,
which is how it should be.

687
01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.059
I have a feeling everything's
going to be just fine.

688
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:31.812
On the other hand...

689
01:01:31.896 --> 01:01:35.607
The hyenas are up there
protecting Scar. What do we do?

690
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:39.069
- Well, I've got a plan.
- How can we help?

691
01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:41.655
Ma, Uncle Max,
you're going to dig a trap.

692
01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:48.245
We're going to need,
dare I say it, tunnels. Lots of tunnels.

693
01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:52.416
Pumbaa, we've got to get
those hyenas away from Simba.

694
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.626
And lure them into the trap?

695
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.712
Nothing gets past you.

696
01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.964
Come on, Pumbaa, let's ride.

697
01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:05.637
Something's different about Timon.

698
01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:09.141
You think?
He's wearing a dress.

699
01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:21.319
Hey, Pumbaa.

700
01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:25.073
What do you call a hyena
with half a brain?

701
01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:27.159
Beats me, Timon. What?

702
01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.327
Gifted.

703
01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.456
They're talking about us.

704
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:36.501
For your last meal,
you're going to eat those words.

705
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.052
Ma, I think we got their attention.

706
01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.973
Not yet. Keep stalling.

707
01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:52.142
OK.

708
01:02:54.061 --> 01:02:56.396
You got to be kidding.

709
01:02:58.399 --> 01:03:01.485
- Now, Ma?
- Need more time, honey.

710
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:09.785
Freestyle.

711
01:03:13.372 --> 01:03:14.998
Encore, encore.

712
01:03:15.082 --> 01:03:18.877
- No, you mean "entree, entree".
- Right. Let's just eat them.

713
01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.921
Is it ready yet, Ma?

714
01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:23.882
Not yet. Keep stalling.

715
01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:32.057
Wait. Hold on a second.

716
01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:34.810
Timon? What are you doing?

717
01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:39.523
Shenzi-Marie-Predatora-
Veldetta-Jackalina-Hyena,

718
01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:44.236
would you do me the honor
of becoming my bride?

719
01:03:47.532 --> 01:03:49.199
I don't think so.

720
01:03:49.283 --> 01:03:51.827
Please.
I know what you're thinking.

721
01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:56.998
We're too different. It'll never work.
What will the children look like?

722
01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.167
That violates the laws of nature.

723
01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.295
Listen. The problems
of a couple of wacky kids like us

724
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:06.007
don't amount to a hill of termites
in this nutty circle of life.

725
01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:09.970
And so I ask you, if not now, when?

726
01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:12.889
If not me, who?

727
01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.891
I'm lonely.

728
01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:16.977
Can I be your best man?

729
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:21.273
I say we skip the wedding
and go straight to the buffet.

730
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:24.401
- Now?
- Sure, if you're ready.

731
01:04:24.485 --> 01:04:28.154
- Now, Max, now.
- Hyenas in the hole.

732
01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:44.921
I need help. It didn't work.

733
01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.467
What are we going to do?

734
01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:01.438
- What?
- Timon, no.

735
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:07.736
Let's get 'em.

736
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.305
- I'd say Scar is down and out.
- We did it.

737
01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:37.349
Where's Timon?
Where's my baby?

738
01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:41.519
He's hurt.
He's dead. Or worse.

739
01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.023
- We've got to find him.
- It's OK, Ma.

740
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:49.402
Please. It is not OK.
Don't you tell me it's OK.

741
01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.740
Timmy.

742
01:05:57.244 --> 01:06:00.580
My son, the hero.

743
01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:07.253
You missed a spot.

744
01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:14.886
That's so beautiful.

745
01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.931
Choking. Not breathing.

746
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.877
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

747
01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.016
That's our boy.

748
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.269
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.

749
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:31.421
You've really come a long way, Timon.

750
01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:34.507
Did you find what you were looking for?

751
01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:39.179
I found a place that was
beyond my wildest dreams,

752
01:07:39.263 --> 01:07:41.181
but it still wasn't home.

753
01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.601
Let's go home, Ma.

754
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:55.945
Welcome to our new home.
A predator-free environment.

755
01:07:56.030 --> 01:08:00.408
I got to hand it to you, Timon,
this place has everything.

756
01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:03.161
Now that we're all here, it does.

757
01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.218
Crane spreads its wings,

758
01:08:18.302 --> 01:08:21.971
turns with dainty hands.

The big wrap-up, the happy ending,
the grand finale.

773
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:12.772
It's over already?

774
01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:17.152
That's the thing about endings.
They come at the end.

775
01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:19.821
- Can we watch it again?
- We just saw it.

776
01:09:19.905 --> 01:09:23.032
- Maybe tomorrow.
- What are you guys doing?

777
01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:28.371
You didn't tell me you were watching
the movie. I want to watch it.

778
01:09:28.455 --> 01:09:31.082
Ma, we just finished.
Show's over.

779
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.793
- You'll just have to rewind it.
- Ma.

780
01:09:33.878 --> 01:09:38.548
- Uncle Max, we're watching the movie.
- Oh, no.

781
01:09:38.632 --> 01:09:43.261
- I brought extra butter.
- You guys are watching the movie?

782
01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.931
Any story worth telling
is worth telling twice.

783
01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:50.101
- What the...
- Excuse me.

784
01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:52.395
Excuse me.

785
01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.900
- Get out of the way.
- Who is this crowd? Down in front.

786
01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.613
<i>Aloha.</i>

787
01:10:06.493 --> 01:10:08.578
Watch it.

788
01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:16.961
- OK, buddy, you win.
- Sure you don't mind?

789
01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.006
- <i>Hakuna Matata</i>.
- Sorry.

790
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:24.594
Timon.
I still don't do so well in crowds.
