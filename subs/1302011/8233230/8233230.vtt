00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:24.274
<i>Long ago, in ancient China,</i>

2
00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:27.647
<i>the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.</i>

3
00:00:28.447 --> 00:00:32.280
<i>They brought great joy
and prosperity to the city</i>

4
00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:35.785
<i>for they had invented fireworks.</i>

5
00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.919
<i>But their son, Lord Shen,</i>

6
00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:45.503
<i>saw darker power in the fireworks.</i>

7
00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:49.208
<i>What had brought colour and joy</i>

8
00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:53.764
<i>could also bring darkness
and destruction.</i>

9
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.717
<i>Shen's troubled parents
consulted a soothsayer.</i>

10
00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:03.187
<i>She foretold that if Shen
continued down this dark path,</i>

11
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.355
<i>he would be defeated
by a warrior of black and white.</i>

12
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:13.110
<i>The young lord
set out to change his fate.</i>

13
00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:18.115
<i>But what he did next only sealed it.</i>

14
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.999
<i>Shen returned to his parents
full of pride.</i>

15
00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:31.306
<i>But in their faces, he saw only horror.</i>

16
00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.894
<i>He was banished from the city forever.</i>

17
00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:39.265
<i>But Shen swore revenge.</i>

18
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.276
<i>Someday he would return</i>

19
00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:46.311
<i>and all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

20
00:02:17.773 --> 00:02:20.691
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:26.775
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

22
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.824
China will be mine.

23
00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:42.166
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

24
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:45.212
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:47.213
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:48.473 --> 00:02:49.552
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:52.050
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

28
00:02:52.227 --> 00:02:53.638
Thirty-three. Stop him!

29
00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:55.057
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

30
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.556
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

31
00:02:57.733 --> 00:02:59.393
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

32
00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:02.024
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.363
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08.536 --> 00:03:11.074
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:13.536
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.915
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:17.201
Do it.

38
00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.790
No problem!

39
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.544
Yeah!

40
00:03:24.678 --> 00:03:26.089
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27.348 --> 00:03:28.759
Yeah!

42
00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.974
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:34.974
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36.274 --> 00:03:38.350
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:41.442
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:49.872 --> 00:03:51.283
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:03.505
Inner peace.

48
00:04:06.515 --> 00:04:09.006
Inner peace.

49
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:14.098
Inner peace.

50
00:04:14.273 --> 00:04:15.684
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:18.560
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:21.654
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:25.868
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

54
00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:28.444
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

55
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:31.619
What are you doing?

56
00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:35.208
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:07.486
Awesome!

58
00:05:07.664 --> 00:05:10.582
How did you do that?

59
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.749
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

60
00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:19.256
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:19.427 --> 00:05:25.263
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

62
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:29.597
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.768
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

64
00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:37.608
Or?

65
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.231
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.778
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

67
00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:46.781
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:50.204
By far.
Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:54.754
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:54.923 --> 00:05:57.379
- OK.
...I have ever experienced.

71
00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.469
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

72
00:06:05.643 --> 00:06:11.230
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.937
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:06:14.111 --> 00:06:16.234
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:19.821
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:21.949
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:23.911
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.159
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.332
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:28.501 --> 00:06:29.580
Danger.

81
00:06:29.752 --> 00:06:33.667
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.212
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:36.384 --> 00:06:38.009
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:39.012 --> 00:06:40.886
Snack stops.

85
00:06:41.056 --> 00:06:42.764
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:57.398
Get all the metal you can find!

87
00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:02.734
Grab the metal!

88
00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:10.577
Help, help, help, help. Help!

89
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.042
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

90
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.335
Oh, no.

91
00:07:23.685 --> 00:07:25.678
Wings of Justice!

92
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:45.864
The Dragon Warrior!

93
00:07:46.043 --> 00:07:48.332
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:50.413
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:51.632 --> 00:07:53.292
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:53.467 --> 00:07:55.793
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

97
00:08:19.036 --> 00:08:20.365
Take that!

98
00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:32.382
Po! Incoming!

99
00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.378
Thanks, Mantis!

100
00:08:52.823 --> 00:08:54.650
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

101
00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:04.490
Feet of Fury!

102
00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:11.337
Tigress! Monkey!

103
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.467
Viper! Mantis!

104
00:09:13.637 --> 00:09:15.464
Bunny! What?

105
00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:17.463
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:23.522 --> 00:09:24.554
Help!

107
00:09:25.691 --> 00:09:27.649
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

108
00:09:46.797 --> 00:09:48.375
Is everyone OK?

109
00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:50.964
That was awesome!

110
00:09:53.722 --> 00:09:54.753
I got this.

111
00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:07.349
Po!

112
00:10:13.618 --> 00:10:15.160
Chew on that, tubby!

113
00:10:21.293 --> 00:10:22.668
Help.

114
00:10:24.755 --> 00:10:27.080
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

115
00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:30.426
I think I saw...

116
00:10:30.594 --> 00:10:32.920
I think...

117
00:10:33.097 --> 00:10:34.508
I gotta go.

118
00:10:36.851 --> 00:10:42.094
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.017
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:46.944
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:47.863 --> 00:10:50.817
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

122
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:55.452
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

123
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.951
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

124
00:10:59.584 --> 00:11:01.458
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

125
00:11:01.628 --> 00:11:05.542
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:11:05.716 --> 00:11:08.041
He doesn't work here any more.

127
00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:11.718
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

128
00:11:11.889 --> 00:11:13.383
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

129
00:11:13.557 --> 00:11:14.589
Po!

130
00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:19.219
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

131
00:11:19.397 --> 00:11:21.639
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:24.058
I would have saved you
some stinky tofu.

133
00:11:25.737 --> 00:11:28.738
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:35.078
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

135
00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:37.121
With purchases.

136
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:40.910
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:41.087 --> 00:11:44.705
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:44.883 --> 00:11:46.543
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:50.550
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:50.722 --> 00:11:52.300
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

141
00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:55.144
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:55.311 --> 00:11:57.268
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

143
00:11:57.438 --> 00:11:59.763
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.191
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:06.315
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:12:06.489 --> 00:12:08.197
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:12:08.366 --> 00:12:12.150
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

148
00:12:12.663 --> 00:12:14.951
Mom? A baby?

149
00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:18.493
- Dad?
- What...?

150
00:12:19.628 --> 00:12:21.668
How do I say this?

151
00:12:23.174 --> 00:12:25.167
Where did I come from?

152
00:12:29.055 --> 00:12:34.845
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:35.228 --> 00:12:39.689
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:41.026 --> 00:12:43.066
I know it's not.

155
00:12:43.237 --> 00:12:48.528
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:49.327 --> 00:12:50.490
OK.

157
00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:54.494
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:58.003 --> 00:12:59.663
...adopted.

159
00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:01.665
- I knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.795
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:04.969 --> 00:13:07.804
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:07.972 --> 00:13:09.846
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:12.185 --> 00:13:14.854
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

164
00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:20.016
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:13:23.947 --> 00:13:26.783
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

166
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:28.575
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.866
<i>I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.</i>

168
00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:36.747
<i>There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i>

169
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:40.542
<i>Only there were no radishes.</i>

170
00:13:40.715 --> 00:13:44.132
<i>Just a very hungry baby panda.</i>

171
00:13:46.972 --> 00:13:48.716
<i>There was no note.</i>

172
00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:50.931
<i>Of course, you could have eaten it.</i>

173
00:13:51.102 --> 00:13:56.097
<i>I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.</i>

174
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:22.084
<i>I brought you inside.</i>

175
00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:25.970
<i>Fed you.</i>

176
00:14:27.641 --> 00:14:29.135
<i>Gave you a bath.</i>

177
00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:34.139
<i>And fed you again.</i>

178
00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:38.234
<i>And again.</i>

179
00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:43.116
<i>And tried to put some pants on you.</i>

180
00:14:51.708 --> 00:14:55.659
<i>And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.</i>

181
00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.960
<i>To make my soup without radishes.</i>

182
00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:05.382
<i>And to raise you as my own son.</i>

183
00:15:05.557 --> 00:15:09.768
<i>Xiao Po, my little panda.</i>

184
00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:15.309
<i>And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life</i>

185
00:15:15.484 --> 00:15:17.643
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:18.696 --> 00:15:21.816
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:26.160
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:30.825
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:35.212
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.373
It was imported, too.

191
00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:40.718
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:49.926
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.605
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:51.773 --> 00:15:55.522
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

195
00:15:55.694 --> 00:15:58.363
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.938
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:01.116 --> 00:16:02.776
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:07.113
And who am I?

199
00:16:14.255 --> 00:16:16.213
Good. Watch your form.

200
00:16:18.927 --> 00:16:20.386
Good.

201
00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:24.759
Better. Elbow.

202
00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:26.926
Straighten it out!

203
00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:54.920
Shen?

204
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:58.045
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:02.965
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:05.264
- Your house?
- Yes.

207
00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:07.927
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

208
00:17:09.899 --> 00:17:12.057
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:12.652 --> 00:17:17.397
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:17.574 --> 00:17:21.572
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:21.745 --> 00:17:24.283
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24.456 --> 00:17:28.952
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:29.128 --> 00:17:31.797
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

214
00:17:31.964 --> 00:17:35.796
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:36.969 --> 00:17:40.220
I'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:43.225
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

217
00:17:43.393 --> 00:17:45.433
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:45.604 --> 00:17:49.139
You want to see? It's a gift.

219
00:17:49.316 --> 00:17:53.100
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

220
00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:54.821
Part of you here, part of you there

221
00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:58.939
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

222
00:17:59.118 --> 00:18:01.111
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:18.848 --> 00:18:21.635
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:24.645
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:26.770
I agree.

226
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.648
But this is.

227
00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:45.375
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:45.543 --> 00:18:46.872
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:47.045 --> 00:18:49.618
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:49.798 --> 00:18:52.752
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:52.926 --> 00:18:54.966
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:55.137 --> 00:18:56.335
That's impossible.

233
00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:58.969
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:02.641
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:02.812 --> 00:19:05.219
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:10.733
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:11.404 --> 00:19:15.272
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.365
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:19.538 --> 00:19:21.365
OK, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:22.625 --> 00:19:25.246
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

241
00:19:25.419 --> 00:19:28.041
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:28.214 --> 00:19:30.123
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:30.299 --> 00:19:33.669
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:42.098
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:19:42.938 --> 00:19:44.017
Peace on.

246
00:19:44.189 --> 00:19:46.229
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

247
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.523
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

248
00:19:48.694 --> 00:19:51.779
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:51.948 --> 00:19:55.198
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:58.288 --> 00:20:01.574
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.624
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:03.794 --> 00:20:06.665
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

253
00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:09.377
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.382
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:15.962
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:20.388
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:20.562 --> 00:20:24.430
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:20:24.608 --> 00:20:27.775
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:31.646
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:31.824 --> 00:20:35.573
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

261
00:20:35.745 --> 00:20:38.318
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

262
00:20:38.498 --> 00:20:41.784
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.914
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:20:45.088 --> 00:20:47.544
You're my son.

265
00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:51.333
Right?

266
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.764
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:57.852 --> 00:20:59.263
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59.437 --> 00:21:01.809
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

269
00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:09.522
Noodles.

270
00:21:15.996 --> 00:21:17.788
Come on, guys, let's go!

271
00:21:17.957 --> 00:21:19.155
Yeah!

272
00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:23.539
Yeah...

273
00:21:23.713 --> 00:21:26.465
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:22:46.052 --> 00:22:47.297
Mama?

275
00:22:52.767 --> 00:22:55.602
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.096
Mom! Dad!

277
00:22:59.983 --> 00:23:02.355
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:03.987 --> 00:23:05.814
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:07.021
But I thought...

280
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:10.117
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:11.204 --> 00:23:14.324
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14.499 --> 00:23:16.373
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:17.043 --> 00:23:18.751
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:23.831
Wait!

285
00:23:30.057 --> 00:23:31.088
No.

286
00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:42.320
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:52.698
Inner pea...

288
00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:56.580
Pea...

289
00:23:59.047 --> 00:24:00.624
Inner peace.

290
00:24:16.983 --> 00:24:21.811
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

291
00:24:27.744 --> 00:24:29.737
I'm... training.

292
00:24:29.913 --> 00:24:32.202
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.245
- I am ready.
- OK.

294
00:24:38.422 --> 00:24:40.415
So serious.

295
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:50.217
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:24:50.393 --> 00:24:55.103
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:55.274 --> 00:24:56.602
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:59.649
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:02.573 --> 00:25:03.605
Again!

300
00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:10.532
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:10.707 --> 00:25:13.459
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:14.378 --> 00:25:16.620
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:16.797 --> 00:25:19.502
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

304
00:25:19.675 --> 00:25:21.632
No. Besides...

305
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.641
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:33.148 --> 00:25:35.769
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:40.480
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:44.366
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:46.996 --> 00:25:49.238
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.791
Yeah.

311
00:25:50.959 --> 00:25:54.328
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:57.505
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:57.674 --> 00:25:59.631
Souls of platinum.

314
00:25:59.801 --> 00:26:01.000
Like you.

315
00:26:01.178 --> 00:26:03.135
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:07.643 --> 00:26:09.683
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

317
00:26:10.605 --> 00:26:12.348
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:12.523 --> 00:26:14.647
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:17.938
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:18.113 --> 00:26:20.485
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

321
00:26:20.657 --> 00:26:23.492
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.700
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:28.030
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:26:28.207 --> 00:26:30.413
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

325
00:26:30.584 --> 00:26:33.254
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:26:33.421 --> 00:26:35.378
Gongmen City.

327
00:26:51.732 --> 00:26:54.270
My father's throne.

328
00:26:54.443 --> 00:26:57.480
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:57.655 --> 00:27:02.152
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:08.279
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.582
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:10.753 --> 00:27:14.038
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

333
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:17.714
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

334
00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:21.586
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

335
00:27:22.515 --> 00:27:23.796
Perfect!

336
00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:27.179
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

337
00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:35.110
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.939
We move out in three days,

339
00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:40.947
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

340
00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.740
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:45.915 --> 00:27:46.947
Fortune?

342
00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:50.835
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:27:51.797 --> 00:27:55.380
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:57.094 --> 00:28:00.629
If you continue on your current path...

345
00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:06.973
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:09.608 --> 00:28:11.481
I see...

347
00:28:12.277 --> 00:28:14.270
I see...

348
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.482
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:21.660
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:22.860
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:23.039 --> 00:28:25.660
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

352
00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:27.826
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:28:29.504 --> 00:28:32.173
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33.425 --> 00:28:35.833
But if you really want
to see the future...

355
00:28:38.722 --> 00:28:40.382
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:46.314 --> 00:28:48.141
A peacock...

357
00:28:49.442 --> 00:28:53.522
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

358
00:28:54.739 --> 00:28:56.732
Nothing has changed.

359
00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.828
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:06.002 --> 00:29:09.205
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.661
Who?

362
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.841
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

363
00:29:16.096 --> 00:29:18.385
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

364
00:29:18.557 --> 00:29:20.181
Big and furry.

365
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.517
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:24.104 --> 00:29:27.308
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27.483 --> 00:29:30.817
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

368
00:29:30.987 --> 00:29:33.857
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:34.782 --> 00:29:37.902
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.821
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:43.829
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

372
00:29:44.001 --> 00:29:47.833
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:52.372
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:54.387 --> 00:29:56.380
Will you stop that!

375
00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:11.653
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:11.822 --> 00:30:14.360
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

377
00:30:14.533 --> 00:30:16.573
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:16.744 --> 00:30:18.737
and we are here
to bring you to justice"!

379
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.835
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30.426 --> 00:30:32.917
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.968
I do not like that guy.

382
00:30:38.142 --> 00:30:41.761
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:41.938 --> 00:30:44.429
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:07.882 --> 00:31:10.089
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

385
00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:13.929
Now, where'd those noodles go?

386
00:31:20.187 --> 00:31:22.264
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:31:23.065 --> 00:31:25.354
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:28.526
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:33.440
OK.

390
00:31:40.042 --> 00:31:41.951
Guys! Guys?

391
00:31:42.128 --> 00:31:43.836
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:31:44.005 --> 00:31:45.499
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:31:45.673 --> 00:31:48.129
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:31:48.301 --> 00:31:50.709
...gold in there, come on!

395
00:31:52.055 --> 00:31:53.335
This rice is raw!

396
00:31:53.515 --> 00:31:56.053
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

397
00:31:56.226 --> 00:31:59.393
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

398
00:31:59.563 --> 00:32:02.315
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

399
00:32:02.483 --> 00:32:04.974
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

400
00:32:05.152 --> 00:32:07.192
- Wait, I have a better idea.
...two...

401
00:32:07.363 --> 00:32:08.561
...one.

402
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.364
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.078
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:32:24.256 --> 00:32:25.964
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:32:26.133 --> 00:32:27.592
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

406
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.927
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

407
00:32:31.097 --> 00:32:32.556
Right.

408
00:32:34.934 --> 00:32:37.426
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:32:37.604 --> 00:32:40.973
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:42.774
What? They're still alive?

411
00:32:42.943 --> 00:32:44.936
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

412
00:32:45.112 --> 00:32:47.817
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

413
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.650
OK, let's go!

414
00:32:49.825 --> 00:32:52.910
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

415
00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:54.359
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

416
00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.783
- Get them!
- Sorry!

417
00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:59.120
Take that!

418
00:32:59.294 --> 00:33:00.872
- Keep going!
- Faster!

419
00:33:01.922 --> 00:33:02.953
Hey, stop!

420
00:33:23.153 --> 00:33:25.146
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

421
00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:26.401
Surround him.

422
00:33:28.826 --> 00:33:30.320
Now!

423
00:33:30.494 --> 00:33:32.238
Gotcha!

424
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:34.534
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:33:34.707 --> 00:33:37.494
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

426
00:33:37.668 --> 00:33:41.619
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

427
00:33:41.798 --> 00:33:43.257
Then search there!

428
00:33:48.263 --> 00:33:51.679
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.843
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

430
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.013
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:02.443
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.905
Cute, huh?

433
00:34:14.166 --> 00:34:15.744
Nice work, Po.

434
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:19.833
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

435
00:34:21.382 --> 00:34:23.174
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:23.343 --> 00:34:25.715
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:34:26.554 --> 00:34:28.843
Master Ox! Master!

438
00:34:31.143 --> 00:34:32.553
The ferocious Master Croc!

439
00:34:34.521 --> 00:34:36.894
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:40.729
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:34:40.903 --> 00:34:42.896
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:34:43.072 --> 00:34:45.694
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:49.953
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

444
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:52.114
We're coming for you, Shen!

445
00:34:57.713 --> 00:35:00.833
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:35:01.008 --> 00:35:02.752
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

447
00:35:02.927 --> 00:35:04.635
Of course we do.

448
00:35:04.804 --> 00:35:08.636
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:35:08.808 --> 00:35:10.600
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

450
00:35:10.769 --> 00:35:12.560
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:35:12.729 --> 00:35:17.356
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:35:17.526 --> 00:35:21.275
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

453
00:35:21.447 --> 00:35:24.020
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.780
...by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:35:28.955 --> 00:35:31.280
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

456
00:35:31.457 --> 00:35:33.949
from telling me
something's unstoppable!

457
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.182
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:49.223
I'd like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:54.816 --> 00:35:57.188
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

460
00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.234
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

461
00:35:59.404 --> 00:36:02.156
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

462
00:36:06.745 --> 00:36:10.446
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

463
00:36:13.211 --> 00:36:14.919
Yes!

464
00:36:15.088 --> 00:36:17.080
All right, let's go!

465
00:36:17.924 --> 00:36:19.169
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:21.344 --> 00:36:25.508
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

467
00:36:25.682 --> 00:36:27.177
I...

468
00:36:30.312 --> 00:36:31.392
You...

469
00:36:31.564 --> 00:36:34.731
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

470
00:36:34.901 --> 00:36:38.352
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

471
00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:41.733
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

472
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.533
With despair for dessert.

473
00:36:43.702 --> 00:36:46.869
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

474
00:36:47.039 --> 00:36:50.953
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

475
00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:52.502
Yeah!

476
00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:56.746
Monkey?!

477
00:36:58.301 --> 00:36:59.629
You! You're mine!

478
00:36:59.802 --> 00:37:01.760
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

479
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.847
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

480
00:37:07.477 --> 00:37:08.888
Get him!

481
00:37:09.438 --> 00:37:11.146
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

482
00:37:11.982 --> 00:37:13.358
Stop him!

483
00:37:16.362 --> 00:37:17.642
Faster!

484
00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:23.233
Yeah! Go, go!

485
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.910
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

486
00:37:27.916 --> 00:37:29.909
- Viper!
- Hang on!

487
00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:42.097
- What?
- Watch out!

488
00:37:44.684 --> 00:37:46.760
Uncool! Very uncool!

489
00:37:47.145 --> 00:37:48.853
Try this!

490
00:37:50.106 --> 00:37:51.269
Guys, guys, guys!

491
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.108
Maybe something smaller!

492
00:37:58.657 --> 00:38:00.780
No, no! Oh, no, no.

493
00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:08.083
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

494
00:38:17.719 --> 00:38:19.428
Fire!

495
00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:21.639
We've lost them.

496
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.607
Again! Again!

497
00:38:33.737 --> 00:38:34.982
Crane, catch!

498
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:39.481
Gotcha!

499
00:38:48.794 --> 00:38:50.787
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

500
00:38:51.547 --> 00:38:53.505
Mantis, now!

501
00:39:06.939 --> 00:39:10.771
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

502
00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:13.185
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

503
00:39:16.407 --> 00:39:17.522
Your turn!

504
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:23.196
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

505
00:39:39.015 --> 00:39:41.341
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

506
00:39:42.644 --> 00:39:46.013
Yes! Taste the defeat!

507
00:39:46.189 --> 00:39:47.565
Let me tell you something.

508
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:50.734
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

509
00:40:00.538 --> 00:40:02.330
Guess nobody told you,

510
00:40:02.499 --> 00:40:05.416
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

511
00:40:05.919 --> 00:40:09.787
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

512
00:40:12.718 --> 00:40:14.627
We surrender!

513
00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:22.394
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

514
00:40:22.562 --> 00:40:25.053
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

515
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:28.398
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

516
00:40:29.945 --> 00:40:32.946
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

517
00:40:33.115 --> 00:40:36.365
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

518
00:40:37.119 --> 00:40:39.278
These are the best cuffs!

519
00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:44.460
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

520
00:40:45.837 --> 00:40:47.664
No, no, no...

521
00:40:50.967 --> 00:40:54.965
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

522
00:40:55.139 --> 00:40:57.630
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

523
00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:02.892
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

524
00:41:03.064 --> 00:41:05.816
He is coming to me in chains.

525
00:41:05.984 --> 00:41:08.475
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

526
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.982
Don't even think about it.

527
00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:30.092
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

528
00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.585
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

529
00:41:32.762 --> 00:41:34.839
This plan's nothing like that plan.

530
00:41:35.015 --> 00:41:37.138
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

531
00:41:49.697 --> 00:41:51.690
Keep moving.

532
00:41:57.372 --> 00:41:59.946
Ah, my old enemy...

533
00:42:04.463 --> 00:42:06.539
...stairs.

534
00:42:34.871 --> 00:42:38.074
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

535
00:42:38.249 --> 00:42:40.657
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

536
00:42:40.836 --> 00:42:42.246
Someone might want to clean that up.

537
00:42:42.421 --> 00:42:45.090
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

538
00:42:45.257 --> 00:42:46.835
Greetings, panda.

539
00:42:47.009 --> 00:42:49.334
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

540
00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:52.466
Hey.

541
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.641
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

542
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.515
Hey... enough with the poking around.

543
00:42:58.688 --> 00:43:01.440
Strong. Healthy.

544
00:43:01.608 --> 00:43:04.277
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

545
00:43:04.444 --> 00:43:06.900
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

546
00:43:07.072 --> 00:43:09.777
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

547
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.035
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

548
00:43:13.204 --> 00:43:14.864
Bring the prisoners to me.

549
00:43:15.039 --> 00:43:16.664
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

550
00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:19.371
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

551
00:43:23.798 --> 00:43:24.997
Sparrow kick!

552
00:43:27.052 --> 00:43:30.219
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

553
00:43:39.398 --> 00:43:42.649
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

554
00:43:42.819 --> 00:43:45.986
I do not. I know he is.

555
00:43:47.282 --> 00:43:50.734
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

556
00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:54.410
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

557
00:43:54.581 --> 00:43:55.827
I did not have a lifetime.

558
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.957
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

559
00:43:58.127 --> 00:44:02.836
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

560
00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:05.498
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

561
00:44:05.677 --> 00:44:08.084
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

562
00:44:08.263 --> 00:44:10.836
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

563
00:44:11.016 --> 00:44:13.139
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

564
00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.552
Know what? What's so funny?

565
00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:18.849
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

566
00:44:19.024 --> 00:44:22.939
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

567
00:44:23.112 --> 00:44:26.446
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

568
00:44:26.616 --> 00:44:29.617
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

569
00:44:30.954 --> 00:44:33.492
The only reason you are still alive

570
00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:38.458
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

571
00:44:38.629 --> 00:44:41.963
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

572
00:44:42.133 --> 00:44:44.006
Who do you think you are, panda?

573
00:44:44.176 --> 00:44:46.881
Who do you think I am, peacock?

574
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.639
Why are we laughing?

575
00:44:58.692 --> 00:44:59.855
Take aim.

576
00:45:11.539 --> 00:45:12.950
Fire.

577
00:45:17.087 --> 00:45:19.792
Well, light the... thing!

578
00:45:19.965 --> 00:45:21.590
I did!

579
00:45:26.347 --> 00:45:28.221
Fear the bug!

580
00:45:37.275 --> 00:45:38.734
Get the weapon!

581
00:45:40.737 --> 00:45:42.611
Tigress!

582
00:46:15.441 --> 00:46:16.852
You... You were there.

583
00:46:17.026 --> 00:46:19.980
Yes. Yes, I was.

584
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:30.996
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

585
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.040
Fire!

586
00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:41.836
Oh. No, he's got way more.

587
00:46:48.185 --> 00:46:49.560
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

588
00:46:49.728 --> 00:46:51.139
Coming!

589
00:46:52.022 --> 00:46:54.430
- Watch out!
- Po!

590
00:46:57.737 --> 00:47:00.607
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

591
00:47:00.782 --> 00:47:02.324
Use the ropes.

592
00:47:11.209 --> 00:47:13.286
Run, run, little panda!

593
00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:27.642
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

594
00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.435
Bring it down!

595
00:47:32.899 --> 00:47:35.188
- We're trapped!
- This way!

596
00:47:39.573 --> 00:47:41.068
Goodbye!

597
00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.448
Fire!

598
00:47:46.914 --> 00:47:48.325
Get back!

599
00:47:56.383 --> 00:47:58.376
The only way out is up.

600
00:47:59.094 --> 00:48:00.505
What?

601
00:48:11.524 --> 00:48:13.980
Follow me! Come on!

602
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:15.898
Where are they going?

603
00:48:16.071 --> 00:48:18.906
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

604
00:48:26.165 --> 00:48:27.707
Here we go!

605
00:48:46.395 --> 00:48:49.729
- You idiot!
- My nose!

606
00:48:49.899 --> 00:48:54.312
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

607
00:48:54.487 --> 00:48:58.106
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

608
00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:01.154
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

609
00:49:01.328 --> 00:49:03.997
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

610
00:49:05.791 --> 00:49:08.911
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

611
00:49:09.086 --> 00:49:11.079
Happy New Year, sir.

612
00:49:14.926 --> 00:49:19.173
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

613
00:49:19.347 --> 00:49:20.426
Now!

614
00:49:20.598 --> 00:49:22.508
Now, now, now, now, now!

615
00:49:22.684 --> 00:49:25.471
Move! Move, move, move, move!

616
00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:43.496
This way.

617
00:49:47.878 --> 00:49:49.705
Let's go.

618
00:49:55.052 --> 00:49:55.966
Oh, you!

619
00:49:56.303 --> 00:49:58.380
What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

620
00:49:58.556 --> 00:50:00.216
What happened to stopping Shen?

621
00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:03.309
Yeah.

622
00:50:04.729 --> 00:50:06.888
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

623
00:50:07.065 --> 00:50:09.188
I meant for him to get away.

624
00:50:09.359 --> 00:50:12.313
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

625
00:50:12.488 --> 00:50:17.399
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

626
00:50:18.077 --> 00:50:20.070
That makes no sense.

627
00:50:20.246 --> 00:50:21.906
What do you mean? Sure it does.

628
00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:25.415
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

629
00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:27.625
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

630
00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:30.334
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

631
00:50:31.049 --> 00:50:32.294
The truth.

632
00:50:35.679 --> 00:50:39.428
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

633
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.138
- Real far.
- What?

634
00:50:42.311 --> 00:50:44.434
You're staying here.

635
00:50:44.939 --> 00:50:47.347
Wait! I have to go ba...

636
00:50:52.739 --> 00:50:54.566
You're staying here!

637
00:50:55.117 --> 00:50:57.275
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

638
00:51:00.581 --> 00:51:02.823
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

639
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.708
Guys? Don't.

640
00:51:04.877 --> 00:51:05.956
Ready.

641
00:51:06.587 --> 00:51:07.619
Look!

642
00:51:20.185 --> 00:51:21.561
Stay down.

643
00:51:23.189 --> 00:51:26.273
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

644
00:51:28.653 --> 00:51:30.978
He was there! OK?

645
00:51:31.155 --> 00:51:34.359
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

646
00:51:34.534 --> 00:51:38.153
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

647
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.786
Who I am.

648
00:51:44.336 --> 00:51:46.459
Look, I'm going.

649
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:49.497
I have to know.

650
00:51:49.675 --> 00:51:51.715
The hard core can't understand.

651
00:51:51.886 --> 00:51:53.594
Tigress, no!

652
00:51:57.767 --> 00:51:59.760
The hard core do understand.

653
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.101
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

654
00:52:05.526 --> 00:52:09.606
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

655
00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.698
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

656
00:52:14.369 --> 00:52:16.527
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

657
00:52:16.704 --> 00:52:18.496
You're better off here.

658
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:32.546
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

659
00:52:33.389 --> 00:52:35.714
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

660
00:52:35.892 --> 00:52:38.846
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

661
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.392
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

662
00:52:41.564 --> 00:52:46.903
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

663
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.526
Then will you finally be satisfied?

664
00:52:49.698 --> 00:52:53.910
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

665
00:52:54.453 --> 00:52:58.451
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

666
00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:04.082
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

667
00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:07.257
It is time to stop this madness.

668
00:53:08.301 --> 00:53:10.211
Why on earth would I do that?

669
00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.594
So your parents can rest in peace.

670
00:53:13.432 --> 00:53:16.386
My parents hated me.

671
00:53:17.603 --> 00:53:20.474
Do you understand?

672
00:53:20.648 --> 00:53:26.023
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

673
00:53:26.196 --> 00:53:27.476
They loved you.

674
00:53:27.656 --> 00:53:32.401
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

675
00:53:34.997 --> 00:53:40.786
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

676
00:53:45.633 --> 00:53:49.678
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

677
00:53:49.846 --> 00:53:53.465
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

678
00:53:53.642 --> 00:53:56.347
Happiness must be taken.

679
00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.352
And I will take mine.

680
00:54:22.256 --> 00:54:25.008
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

681
00:54:26.135 --> 00:54:29.255
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

682
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:33.725
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

683
00:54:36.354 --> 00:54:38.513
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

684
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.185
I can't feel my face.

685
00:54:55.667 --> 00:54:58.621
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

686
00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:01.037
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:02.757
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

688
00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:05.332
You! Where are you going?

689
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:10.881
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

690
00:55:24.323 --> 00:55:28.107
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

691
00:55:38.421 --> 00:55:40.414
Greetings, panda.

692
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:47.012
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

693
00:55:47.181 --> 00:55:50.182
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

694
00:55:50.351 --> 00:55:53.352
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

695
00:55:54.272 --> 00:55:58.056
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

696
00:55:58.234 --> 00:56:02.813
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

697
00:56:12.958 --> 00:56:14.417
Here's your New Year's gift.

698
00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:16.744
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

699
00:56:18.631 --> 00:56:21.003
Po? What's he doing here?

700
00:56:21.926 --> 00:56:23.171
Return it! Return it!

701
00:56:35.232 --> 00:56:37.770
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

702
00:56:37.943 --> 00:56:41.526
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

703
00:57:04.305 --> 00:57:06.013
We got them. Go!

704
00:57:27.747 --> 00:57:29.241
You looking for me?

705
00:57:36.256 --> 00:57:38.048
I said that too soon, didn't I?

706
00:57:46.475 --> 00:57:47.638
Po!

707
00:57:52.398 --> 00:57:53.941
Po, get away from him.

708
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:56.066
I'll get up. Here we go.

709
00:57:58.864 --> 00:58:01.533
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

710
00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.693
Now... answers.

711
00:58:03.869 --> 00:58:06.621
Oh, you want to know so badly.

712
00:58:07.248 --> 00:58:10.451
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

713
00:58:10.626 --> 00:58:14.671
Fill some crater in your soul?

714
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:16.998
Well, here's your answer.

715
00:58:17.175 --> 00:58:20.260
Your parents didn't love you.

716
00:58:21.305 --> 00:58:23.178
But here...

717
00:58:23.348 --> 00:58:26.018
...let me heal you!

718
00:58:32.024 --> 00:58:33.816
No!

719
00:59:48.398 --> 00:59:50.889
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

720
00:59:55.155 --> 00:59:59.403
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

721
00:59:59.577 --> 01:00:03.527
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

722
01:00:03.706 --> 01:00:06.910
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

723
01:00:09.212 --> 01:00:10.754
What is this place?

724
01:00:10.922 --> 01:00:14.920
I'm surprised you remember so little.

725
01:00:15.093 --> 01:00:18.545
But you were so little when it happened.

726
01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:26.391
Perhaps you do remember.

727
01:00:26.564 --> 01:00:28.557
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

728
01:00:28.733 --> 01:00:30.809
Nightmare? Or memory?

729
01:01:01.769 --> 01:01:04.390
This was a thriving village.

730
01:01:04.563 --> 01:01:08.098
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

731
01:01:08.276 --> 01:01:10.103
But he wanted more.

732
01:01:10.278 --> 01:01:16.032
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

733
01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:20.151
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

734
01:01:33.344 --> 01:01:34.755
Get them all!

735
01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.806
Take our son and run away! Go!

736
01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:01.990
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

737
01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:10.005
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

738
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:13.299
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

739
01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:16.013
It is the rest of your story.

740
01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:19.012
Who you choose to be.

741
01:04:51.182 --> 01:04:54.551
So, who are you, panda?

742
01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:04.230
I am Po.

743
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:07.988
And I'm gonna need a hat.

744
01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:20.373
Such sad, sad faces.

745
01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:23.253
But now is a time only for joy.

746
01:05:23.425 --> 01:05:27.470
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

747
01:05:29.723 --> 01:05:33.721
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

748
01:05:33.894 --> 01:05:38.058
you and your precious kung fu will die.

749
01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:45.146
Then China will know to bow before me.

750
01:05:45.323 --> 01:05:46.983
Set sail!

751
01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.665
What is that?

752
01:06:20.152 --> 01:06:23.319
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

753
01:06:23.489 --> 01:06:26.491
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

754
01:06:26.659 --> 01:06:28.403
...then she'd eat my head.

755
01:06:28.578 --> 01:06:30.986
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

756
01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:35.708
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

757
01:06:43.678 --> 01:06:47.628
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

758
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:49.548
Fire!

759
01:06:58.819 --> 01:07:00.646
You coward!

760
01:07:10.582 --> 01:07:11.661
Po?

761
01:07:14.085 --> 01:07:15.117
Po?

762
01:07:17.214 --> 01:07:22.339
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

763
01:07:31.938 --> 01:07:33.349
Shen!

764
01:07:33.523 --> 01:07:37.568
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

765
01:07:38.278 --> 01:07:39.309
What?

766
01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:43.486
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

767
01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:45.319
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

768
01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:48.745
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

769
01:07:48.915 --> 01:07:50.991
Disc of Destruction!

770
01:08:02.095 --> 01:08:05.013
OK. Take aim!

771
01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:17.944
Ready?

772
01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:40.842
You can't follow me.

773
01:08:41.012 --> 01:08:42.091
Just get him!

774
01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:49.138
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

775
01:08:56.404 --> 01:08:57.779
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

776
01:08:57.947 --> 01:08:58.978
No, don't shoot!

777
01:08:59.157 --> 01:09:01.564
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

778
01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:04.151
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

779
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:07.571
Yeah!

780
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:10.620
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

781
01:09:16.801 --> 01:09:19.256
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

782
01:09:24.601 --> 01:09:26.807
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

783
01:09:26.978 --> 01:09:29.137
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

784
01:09:29.314 --> 01:09:31.058
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

785
01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.264
Po!

786
01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:34.566
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

787
01:09:40.117 --> 01:09:41.149
Nice!

788
01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:45.075
Viper, Puppet of Death!

789
01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:46.821
Tigress!

790
01:09:55.509 --> 01:09:57.502
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

791
01:09:57.678 --> 01:10:00.169
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

792
01:10:00.347 --> 01:10:03.183
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

793
01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:12.015
Master Shifu!

794
01:10:14.362 --> 01:10:16.688
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

795
01:10:27.502 --> 01:10:28.533
Crane!

796
01:10:29.504 --> 01:10:31.413
Wings of Justice!

797
01:10:33.508 --> 01:10:34.706
Yeah!

798
01:10:40.849 --> 01:10:41.881
What?

799
01:10:51.903 --> 01:10:55.983
I love you guys.

800
01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.577
Why aren't we firing?

801
01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:10.168
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

802
01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:14.920
Fire! Fire at them!

803
01:11:15.595 --> 01:11:19.178
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

804
01:11:19.349 --> 01:11:20.380
Fire!

805
01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.051
No.

806
01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:32.976
Po!

807
01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:09.683
Tigress?

808
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.248
As you wish.

809
01:13:01.417 --> 01:13:03.042
Let's finish this.

810
01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:27.934
Fire!

811
01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:34.820
<i>Inner peace.</i>

812
01:14:02.274 --> 01:14:03.305
Again!

813
01:14:10.616 --> 01:14:11.648
Yeah!

814
01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:15.906
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

815
01:14:38.104 --> 01:14:40.512
What? No. No!

816
01:14:47.156 --> 01:14:50.157
Keep firing! Keep firing!

817
01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:12.300
Skadoosh.

818
01:15:42.549 --> 01:15:43.877
How did you...?

819
01:15:45.301 --> 01:15:46.926
How did you do it?

820
01:15:50.766 --> 01:15:53.387
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

821
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.727
Not that. How did you find peace?

822
01:15:56.897 --> 01:16:00.563
I took away your parents. Everything.

823
01:16:00.735 --> 01:16:03.107
I scarred you for life.

824
01:16:03.738 --> 01:16:07.238
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

825
01:16:07.409 --> 01:16:11.407
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

826
01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.988
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

827
01:16:14.166 --> 01:16:18.579
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

828
01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:22.669
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

829
01:16:22.842 --> 01:16:27.338
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

830
01:16:27.514 --> 01:16:28.924
You're right.

831
01:16:29.099 --> 01:16:31.471
Then I choose... this!

832
01:17:24.283 --> 01:17:26.489
That was pretty hard-core.

833
01:17:35.837 --> 01:17:36.916
- Po!
- You did it!

834
01:17:37.088 --> 01:17:40.173
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

835
01:17:40.342 --> 01:17:44.007
It seems you have found inner peace.

836
01:17:44.179 --> 01:17:46.505
And at such a young age.

837
01:17:46.682 --> 01:17:48.556
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

838
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:13.205
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

839
01:18:13.377 --> 01:18:15.750
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

840
01:18:15.922 --> 01:18:18.674
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

841
01:18:18.841 --> 01:18:21.677
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

842
01:18:21.845 --> 01:18:23.220
When do you think he'll be back?

843
01:18:26.183 --> 01:18:30.181
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

844
01:18:30.354 --> 01:18:33.688
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

845
01:18:33.858 --> 01:18:36.064
At least, I was his dad.

846
01:18:36.235 --> 01:18:39.854
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

847
01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:43.732
But why? He's just one little panda.

848
01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:03.044
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

849
01:19:04.057 --> 01:19:05.432
Yep.

850
01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.889
Well, I knew you would.

851
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:09.805
That's why I had new signs made.

852
01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:12.222
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

853
01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.890
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

854
01:19:15.069 --> 01:19:16.444
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

855
01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:19.281
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

856
01:19:22.076 --> 01:19:24.152
There's something I should tell you.

857
01:19:26.956 --> 01:19:31.369
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

858
01:19:33.088 --> 01:19:36.457
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

859
01:19:36.633 --> 01:19:38.258
You did?

860
01:19:39.094 --> 01:19:43.009
- I know who I am.
- You do?

861
01:19:45.017 --> 01:19:46.642
I'm your son.

862
01:19:52.776 --> 01:19:54.400
I love you, Dad.

863
01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:57.319
I love you, too, son.

864
01:20:01.368 --> 01:20:03.408
Delicious, fat radishes!

865
01:20:03.579 --> 01:20:05.702
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

866
01:20:05.873 --> 01:20:07.617
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

867
01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.203
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

868
01:20:09.377 --> 01:20:11.500
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

869
01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:13.960
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

870
01:20:14.132 --> 01:20:15.163
- Po.
- Dad.

871
01:20:15.342 --> 01:20:16.801
- Po!
