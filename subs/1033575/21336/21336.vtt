00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,381
What's wrong with you?

2
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,013
You haven 't answered my emails.

3
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,265
I can't tell you now.

4
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,025
Yes, you can.

5
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,528
Who is the caveman?

6
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,777
The man Grandfather wanted me to find.

7
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,164
You can't bring him in like that.

8
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,923
Lord Shingen, your father is asking for you.

9
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,926
It is time.

10
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,643
I need to speak with my father...

11
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,147
before he speaks to Grandfather.

12
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,323
He ' I l tal k to you later, Mari ko.

13
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,988
Father! I need to see you now!

14
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:08,944
Not now, Mariko!

15
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,233
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

16
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,148
I ' m sti I l dyi ng.

17
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,169
There is no easy way to say this.

18
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,959
But then, it's never been easy for us, has it?

19
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,258
I have tried, father.

20
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,840
You 've done the best you can.

21
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,014
That will never happen.

22
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,290
I pledge to you...

23
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,376
Master Yashida...

24
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,550
to be vigilant...

25
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,680
and to dedicate my life...

26
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,887
to protect Mariko.

27
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,906
This cowardly attack was...

28
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,030
the work of Yakuza thugs.

29
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:16,364
A violent response to my efforts...

30
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,708
to crack down on organized crime.

31
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,713
They exited the North Gate.

32
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,754
She was with the stranger --

33
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,474
Kill him already!

34
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:19,180
Our island is long and thin.

35
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,845
Trains only run in two directions.

36
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,847
I assure you Lord Shingen...

37
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,887
my officers are making every effort--

38
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,976
Then they' re idiots.

39
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,065
You've wasted enough of my time.

40
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,020
I have my father's affairs to attend to.

41
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,065
Get out and find her

42
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,854
If the Yakuza got into the funeral...

43
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,484
they had someone inside.

44
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:16,153
They' ll never find me here.

45
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,990
You're not safe.

46
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:21,901
I 'm coming down there.

47
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,528
They' ll follow you.

48
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,071
Please.

49
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,741
Wait a few days.

50
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:29,292
Please. I'm fine.

51
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:31,164
Logan's here.

52
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,413
He's wounded, Mariko.

53
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,291
Someone's here.

54
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:37,959
I have to go.

55
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,391
A tree fell on the road.

56
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,603
The men could use some help.

57
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:07,670
Did you know I stud ied biology i n col lege?

58
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,014
Genetics.

59
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,478
There are genes that skip generations.

60
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,769
Recessive genes.

61
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:23,351
Eyes.

62
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,478
Eyes. Hai r.

63
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,151
Talent.

64
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,033
Temperament.

65
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:35,410
N ot every chi ld gets the same.

66
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,329
My father saw I ittle of hi mself i n me.

67
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:40,999
But i n you...

68
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,747
he faced a mirror.

69
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,814
How d id you convi nce my father...

70
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:06,478
to award you control...

71
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,105
of Asia's largest corporation?

72
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,023
You've gone insane.

73
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,322
I ' m just waking up.

74
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,617
If you kill me, you will lose...

75
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:18,740
what little honor you have left.

76
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:23,666
Fear not Mariko.

77
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:26,297
I don't want to hurt you.

78
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:27,791
I want to help you.

79
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:29,668
Help you end your pain...

80
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,136
what that mUTAnt stopped you...

81
01:28:31,348 --> 01:28:32,633
from doing last week.

82
01:28:32,849 --> 01:28:35,056
I never wanted to die, Father.

83
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,862
It's alright, Mariko.

84
01:28:59,084 --> 01:28:59,823
Come with me.

85
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,824
What is happening?!

86
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,334
More than you can i magi ne.

87
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:35,072
Why have you brought me here?

88
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:36,949
What are you hiding?

89
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:38,822
You will soon find out.

90
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,852
I know you care for him.

91
01:50:54,314 --> 01:50:55,804
You need to let go of that.

92
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,144
You are a Yashida.

93
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:00,316
She betrayed my grandfather...

94
01:51:00,779 --> 01:51:02,064
and so have you.

95
01:51:02,739 --> 01:51:03,478
No Mariko.

96
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,697
We grEW up together.

97
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:07,403
You need to trust me.

98
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:10,368
Let me go to him!

99
01:51:10,539 --> 01:51:12,996
He saved my life!

100
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:15,540
Let him go, Mariko!

101
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:16,999
This isn 't easy for me but...

102
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:20,249
I 'm following Grandfather's wishes.

103
01:51:30,058 --> 01:51:31,514
The Viper woman is evil...

104
01:51:31,685 --> 01:51:33,471
we both know that.

105
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,432
But she's a means to an end...

106
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,606
an end your grandfather wanted.

107
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:08,259
You need to trust me.

108
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:10,220
Is that hard?

109
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:13,507
We were meant to be together.

110
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:16,010
We still can be.

111
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:18,432
Perhaps.

112
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:55,553
This is madness.

113
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:52,854
I ' m sorry.

114
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,732
You are a monster.

115
02:05:28,354 --> 02:05:31,221
You are my only fam i ly.

116
02:05:32,817 --> 02:05:35,149
Be well, sister.
