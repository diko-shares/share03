1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,877
My name is Peyton Westlake.

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,007
I WAS a scientist on the verge
of an amazing liquid skin discovery,

3
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,551
until they took it all away.

4
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:59,400
They smashed my life
into a million pieces.

5
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:04,238
Everything was destroyed -
my work, my dreams...everything.

6
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,622
They burned away my identity -
leaving me for dead.

7
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:16,083
Take him to the burn unit.

8
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:19,253
Stat. Just hold on, pal.
I'm with you.

9
00:01:20,963 --> 00:01:23,507
But I wasn't truly dead.

10
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,926
Driven by uncontrollable surges
of adrenaline,

11
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,803
I had the strength of ten men.

12
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:33,767
I became a monster,
left to lurk in the shadows.

13
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,229
Now science is my only hope.

14
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:44,611
My synthetic skin formula
gave me back my face...

15
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:48,573
but only for 99 minutes.

16
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,367
99 minutes...

17
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:56,164
As I try to rebuild myself, I fight
for those who have no defender.

18
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,840
Now crime has a new enemy.

19
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:09,218
And justice has a brand new face.

20
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,907
Show time.

21
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,675
Come on, let's move.

22
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:44,036
So this is yours?
Are you going ecological, Rooker?

23
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:48,040
Demolition and reclamation,
Johnny Lee. That's where it's at.

24
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:50,709
Intact, pigeons wouldn't live
in this dump.

25
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,545
In pieces, it's worth millions.

26
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,924
A good businessman follows the money,
Johnny Lee. That's why I diversify...

27
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:01,094
property, businesses...you.

28
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,306
Nico.

29
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,271
Guys...

30
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,731
I don't get it.

31
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,943
Your organisation handles
coke, weed, crack...

32
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:22,031
But you... You show up to supervise
a two-bit shipment of steroids.

33
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:24,408
I'm not into drugs.

34
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,165
- What the fuck is this shit?
- Strength.

35
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,796
Thank you. Get the rest, Adam.

36
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,723
Hey, good-looking.

37
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,434
Hmm?

38
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,025
Game, set and match.

39
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,403
Always a pleasure doing business
with you, Rooker.

40
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,781
- How's he doing?
- Er, Peter?

41
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:09,869
The light should've turned this
as blue as a bruise. Shit's been cut.

42
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,798
Are you shorting me?

43
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,385
Fuck. It ain't happenin' on my end.

44
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,512
Of course it's not.

45
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,891
How long have we been
doing business? Five years?

46
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,686
- At least four.
- We've had drinks, swapped jokes...

47
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,780
Did you really think
you could cheat me, Johnny?

48
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,866
Like the taste of that, Rooker?

49
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,245
I pissed in it.

50
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,466
Put that in the car, Adam... ADAM!

51
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,844
You flipped, man?

52
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,765
- What the fuck is wrong with you?!
- Jesus, somebody cold clocked me.

53
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,602
What the fuck?!

54
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:23,066
Get him! He's got the money,
the son of a bitch!

55
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:27,403
Come back here, you asshole! Hey!

56
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,572
Come here!

57
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:31,658
God damn you!

58
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,535
God damn you!

59
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,706
Hey!

60
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,044
So it's true.

61
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,254
Get him! Get him!

62
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,965
Jesus!

63
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,720
- I'm gonna get him!
- Who is this guy?

64
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:03,647
Going down.

65
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:10,863
Shit!

66
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,109
- You made me look real bad.
- You could do worse.

67
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,367
Run, coward, run.

68
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,390
'Medicom Laboratories
is now closing.

69
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,643
'All exits will be locked
in 15 minutes.

70
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,989
- How you doing, Doc?
- What have you got?

71
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,408
The portacom and the gene splicer.

72
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,036
- DNA sequencer?
- I'll work on it.

73
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:47,040
Is that enough?

74
00:09:47,123 --> 00:09:49,375
That ought to cover it.

75
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,296
I've got a slightly dinged-up
microscope I'll let you have cheap.

76
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:57,342
- No, I need that sequencer.
- OK, OK. Get back to me.

77
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,058
Yeah, yeah. He was just here.

78
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,269
Yeah, it's on there.

79
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:11,856
OK, and remember,
you fuckin' owe me. OK.

80
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,406
I know you're out there.

81
00:11:16,127 --> 00:11:18,462
Welcome back, Dr Westlake.

82
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,096
All systems running smoothly.

83
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,899
Lab access update - clear
through tunnels four, five, eight.

84
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:41,109
Tunnel 12, train in transit.

85
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,487
Sensors clear.

86
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,953
Lab perimeter secure. No irregular
activity in monitored areas.

87
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,054
Good night, Dr Westlake.

88
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,599
Home, sweet home.

89
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:56,892
Status report -
lab control systems: static.

90
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:01,980
Liquid-skin system,
cryogenic storage: active capacity.

91
00:13:02,063 --> 00:13:06,443
Hypo-tube processors: idling at 12%.

92
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:17,704
Systems await your command, Doctor.
Next status report in 30 minutes.

93
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:23,126
Hello, kitty. Hello, kitty.

94
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,505
You think I brought you some milk,
don't you? I'm afraid not, my friend.

95
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,841
No, no, no.

96
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:37,640
Well, back to work.

97
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,915
You handsome devil.

98
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:17,178
Initiating digital scan
of subject photograph.

99
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,558
Digitisation complete.

100
00:14:23,101 --> 00:14:27,063
Beginning three-dimensional
photographic imaging.

101
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:35,988
Completed.

102
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:47,583
Implementing skin matrix formula,
number 3,714.

103
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,989
Maybe this will be the one.

104
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:23,743
Estimated
photosensitivity index: unknown.

105
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,291
Begin countdown.

106
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,267
99 minutes, plus...

107
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:36,273
They're holding! They're holding!

108
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:44,531
We did it! We did it!
We broke the 99-minute barrier!

109
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,160
We did it! We did it! We did it!

110
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:00,922
Unfortunately,
time does march on.

111
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,549
Photosensitivity reaction.

112
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:07,136
Skin matrix breakdown at 99 minutes.

113
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:11,265
Failure, 99 minutes. Failure.

114
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:14,351
I hate the way I look,
but what can I do?

115
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:17,855
Introducing Sudden Youth,
a breakthrough for everyone with...

116
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,129
Let us review, shall we, gentlemen?

117
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:47,133
We need a replacement for Mr Lee.

118
00:17:47,217 --> 00:17:50,512
I'm down $100,000.

119
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:58,061
And an open casket is definitely out
for Adam's funeral.

120
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:03,191
- Nico?
- The drugs were ruined.

121
00:18:03,274 --> 00:18:04,275
Ah!

122
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,616
My merchandise, my money and poor
Adam, all lost because of one man.

123
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,995
What could we do? He was tossing us
around like we were nothing.

124
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:19,206
You're less than nothing.
You're pathetic.

125
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:28,924
Give me five men as strong as him
and I could own this town.

126
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,010
Peter?

127
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:35,055
.. Diane Platts
at the high school. Diane?

128
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,140
Thanks, Bill.

129
00:18:36,223 --> 00:18:39,935
I'm at a local high school
where another student,

130
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:44,022
a football player, has died
from the abuse of illegal steroids.

131
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:48,610
It's another tragic case in
what is now being called Roid Rage.

132
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,320
For more, here's Paul Raney.

133
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:54,449
With Tuesday's race for district
attorney beginning to heat up,

134
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:58,703
showing a commanding lead,
Ryan Mitchell seems certain to win.

135
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:01,956
Earlier today he outlined
his proposed war on drugs.

136
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,292
The FBI has traced the drugs

137
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,670
to an organised crime ring
working in our city.

138
00:19:07,754 --> 00:19:09,714
Elect me your new district attorney

139
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:12,967
and I will see
that this dangerous element

140
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,553
leaking this insidious drug
onto the streets,

141
00:19:15,636 --> 00:19:16,763
that these animals...

142
00:19:16,846 --> 00:19:20,850
Animals?!
Who's he calling an animal?.!

143
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:22,351
Nico.

144
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:29,608
The election's a week away
and he behaves as if he's already in.

145
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,111
Well, he's got balls,
I'll give him that.

146
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:37,283
The polls give him ten points over
our man. He says he has big plans...

147
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:42,621
- Governor, senator...
- I've got my own plans for Mitchell.

148
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:44,540
Daddy, look, my new dress!

149
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:48,001
- Not now, Jenny!
- Peter?!

150
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:53,090
I thought I told you not to interrupt
me when I was discussing business.

151
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:56,718
- Sorry, I thought...
- Don't think, Angela, please.

152
00:19:56,802 --> 00:19:59,971
It just gets you in trouble.
What's that she's wearing?

153
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:02,516
That's her costume
for the school play.

154
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,770
If you ever spent more than five
minutes with her, you'd know that.

155
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:11,399
Now, gentlemen.

156
00:20:12,233 --> 00:20:14,277
Mr Mitchell.

157
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,995
Dissolution at 99 minutes...

158
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:25,621
Perimeter violation.

159
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:29,417
- Alert, intruder in passage.
- What have we here?

160
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:33,045
Alert! Intruder! Intruder!

161
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,714
Let's find out.

162
00:20:43,973 --> 00:20:46,433
- You scared me.
- How did you find me?

163
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:49,978
- With this.
- Ah! A tracking device.

164
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:53,232
I planted it in the crate
you took from Medicom.

165
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:56,193
I've been trying
to find you for months.

166
00:20:59,821 --> 00:21:01,490
You're very smart.

167
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:04,826
I hope you're smart enough
to find your way back.

168
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,661
Please! Dr Westlake!

169
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:09,748
Just hear me out.

170
00:21:09,831 --> 00:21:12,292
My name is Bridget Thorne.

171
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,294
Dr Bridget Thorne.

172
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,630
I attended you at County Medical.

173
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:20,508
Attended?

174
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:23,261
Should I thank you or kill you?

175
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:26,598
You were nearly dead
when they brought you in.

176
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,349
In terrible pain.

177
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:30,268
We had no choice.

178
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,812
We had to sever your thalamic nerve.

179
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:36,399
I know you can't feel anything
any more.

180
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:40,069
- But now your burns have healed...
- Healed?!

181
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:43,572
Does this look healed, Doctor?

182
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:47,368
I've already seen what's
beneath the mask, but go ahead.

183
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:55,209
I believe I can repair
your nervous system.

184
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:58,003
- Impossible. It's never been done.
- Not yet.

185
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:02,758
But I've developed a new micro
surgery procedure. My own design.

186
00:22:04,718 --> 00:22:08,805
- All I need is a subject.
- You mean a human lab rat.

187
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,849
- Right?
- I won't lie.

188
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,268
Go home, Doctor.
You're wasting your time.

189
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:17,773
But if we can repair your nerves,
you'll be able to feel again.

190
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,066
Think about the contribution
we'll make

191
00:22:20,192 --> 00:22:23,111
in the study of the nervous system.

192
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:26,197
Nobody will ever have
to go through this again.

193
00:22:26,281 --> 00:22:30,827
Let me tell you something,
Doctor Bridget Thorne.

194
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:36,082
It's been a while since I've cared
for anybody and I'm not starting now.

195
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40,795
- Just trust me.
- Why? Because you're a doctor?

196
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,964
No. Because I care.

197
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:48,761
- Your facility is fully equipped?
- The best, I promise.

198
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:52,807
I'm not interested in your promises,
I'm interested in your lab.

199
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,519
I need a DNA sequencer for research.

200
00:22:56,602 --> 00:22:58,896
I have a Pace Tower 9000.
Top of the line.

201
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:01,482
As much log-time as I want?

202
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:03,776
Yes.
And we can be there in 20 minutes.

203
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:18,665
It's quiet, it's private,

204
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:22,336
and you won't believe
the deal I got on the rent.

205
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:25,338
Well, it certainly is spacious.

206
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:31,720
Who pays for this?

207
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:36,391
I wish I could say it was university
money or a genius grant.

208
00:23:36,474 --> 00:23:39,394
Truth is Daddy pays for everything.

209
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:41,271
That must be nice.

210
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,941
He's always believed in my work.

211
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,283
Synthetic skin? Wow!

212
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:58,621
- This is really quite brilliant.
- Yeah, for 99 minutes.

213
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:00,498
Then it's a total failure.

214
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,421
Why?

215
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:11,425
Light waves break down the cells.
That's why I need your sequencer.

216
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,720
To find a formula
that will be permanent.

217
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:18,974
I don't need your pity.

218
00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:22,519
I don't pity you, Peyton.

219
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:29,109
I just want you to know...that you
don't have to wear a mask for me.

220
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:39,619
Comparative study of DNA matrix
test formula 101, 102 and 106.

221
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,371
Mark.

222
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,209
You sure don't waste any time,
do you?

223
00:24:49,129 --> 00:24:50,839
What's on the disk?

224
00:24:50,964 --> 00:24:54,050
My work - study, research.

225
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:56,261
Somehow this survived the fire.

226
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,598
Maybe you should make a back up.

227
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:06,270
Maybe I should pass it around town,
let everybody have a crack at it.

228
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:10,191
Hey, I'm on your side, remember?

229
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:14,362
I'm sorry.

230
00:25:15,946 --> 00:25:17,948
It's all right.

231
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:21,994
Come on, time for your check-up.

232
00:25:39,636 --> 00:25:42,139
Just hold on, pal. I'm with you.

233
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:50,855
So you want to feel again?

234
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:56,945
You're a freak!
Nothing but a freak!

235
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:17,798
Bridget?

236
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:22,178
Bridget? Where are you?

237
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:25,598
Let's get to work.

238
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:34,648
DNA sequencing - stable.

239
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,446
3-2-1-6-1.

240
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:45,659
Molecular balance
and structure - holding.

241
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,332
Matrix alignment appears coherent.

242
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:01,216
- Peyton!
- Huh?

243
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:04,844
- You're awake!
- Bridget, it worked!

244
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:06,429
It what?!

245
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:09,599
You shouldn't feel sensation
for at least a week.

246
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:15,396
Not that. Come, take a look at this.

247
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,608
I must've been almost there
when my lab was destroyed.

248
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:20,526
With the data on disk

249
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,906
the DNA sequencer was able to arrange
the cells in the correct pattern.

250
00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:26,532
I don't understand.

251
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:32,913
Voila! Liquid skin cells.

252
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:37,626
- How long have they lasted?
- 300 minutes and counting.

253
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:45,467
I've been synthesising a sample and
I've got almost enough for my face.

254
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:51,348
- Have you tested it?
- Watch. Hold this.

255
00:27:58,522 --> 00:27:59,982
Cheers, Doctor.

256
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:04,361
Now watch closely.

257
00:28:08,365 --> 00:28:09,533
Yes.

258
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:14,954
Ah!

259
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:21,252
You've perfected liquid skin.

260
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:24,172
I don't even know
how it works, Bridget,

261
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:27,508
but by tomorrow,
I'll have the secret...

262
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,762
and the skin.

263
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:34,932
I was wrong to doubt you.

264
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,144
I had a nightmare.

265
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:42,398
I dreamt you were laughing at me,
trying to hurt me.

266
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:46,652
- But now I know the truth...
- The truth is it was no dream!

267
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:48,154
What?!

268
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,573
Say hello to Daddy.

269
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:51,782
No!

270
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:07,256
Good job.
You'll make a believer out of me yet.

271
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:11,051
- What did you do to me?
- The operation was a great success.

272
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:14,096
I reconnected your thalamic nerve,
all right.

273
00:29:15,138 --> 00:29:17,849
Reconnected it to this.

274
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,351
What do you want?

275
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:22,312
I want my $100,000 dollars you stole.

276
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:26,691
But since I can't have it,
I'll take you in trade.

277
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:29,402
No! Not my work! No!

278
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,074
I reconnected
your thalamic nerve, all right.

279
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:19,743
Nothing but a freak!

280
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,956
No! No! No!

281
00:30:38,845 --> 00:30:40,388
Gotta get out.

282
00:30:45,518 --> 00:30:46,728
He's out.

283
00:31:15,089 --> 00:31:17,674
Learn to shoot, you bunch of gummers!

284
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,572
Hello!

285
00:31:44,034 --> 00:31:47,245
- Hey, French fry!
- Ah, no.

286
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:51,416
Do it.

287
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:18,734
He made it!

288
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:24,615
- What do you want from me?
- Your strength.

289
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:28,786
- And if I don't give it?
- I destroy your research.

290
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,498
And you'll always look
like the bottom of a shoe.

291
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:34,416
I'll kill you!

292
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:41,590
You see,
it goes something like this...

293
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:47,846
you can either be a good boy, or...

294
00:32:49,306 --> 00:32:53,601
I can give you more of this.
Personally, I'd be a good boy.

295
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,479
His strength increases with stress.

296
00:32:56,563 --> 00:33:00,275
With luck, the obstacle course
pushed him to a ten.

297
00:33:01,943 --> 00:33:06,948
Get him on the table. I want a blood
sample while he's still amped up.

298
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:10,576
I trusted you!

299
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,121
Life's a bitch...and so am I.

300
00:33:15,581 --> 00:33:18,709
- Ah, women.
- Never touch them.

301
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,171
Shh!

302
00:33:33,015 --> 00:33:35,642
You! Why me?

303
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:41,231
No ID, no face, no prints.

304
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,109
You were the perfect subject...

305
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:47,487
until you disappeared
from the hospital.

306
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:52,117
Rooker thought I was scamming him,
till you appeared at his steroid buy.

307
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,245
You are a doctor! A healer!

308
00:33:55,328 --> 00:34:01,042
By using your adrenal samples,
I can synthesise a black market drug

309
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:05,213
that'll make Rooker's steroids
look like rat piss.

310
00:34:07,298 --> 00:34:10,343
- You're selling it?
- Just think. Football, boxing...

311
00:34:10,426 --> 00:34:13,721
Almost any sport.
Do you know what that's worth?

312
00:34:13,805 --> 00:34:17,100
I can fund
a dozen research facilities.

313
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:21,104
- Creating more of me?
- Oh, no...

314
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,189
Better than you.

315
00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:32,907
I'm nobody's lab rat,
do you understand?

316
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:40,122
I have successfully replicated
Dr Westlake's strength and stamina

317
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,292
in each of my control animals.

318
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:49,131
The subjects show
radically increased strength.

319
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,432
What's he doing to that cat?

320
00:35:02,853 --> 00:35:05,188
Now, that's a rat.

321
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,244
I trusted you!

322
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,836
Yes.

323
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:41,932
Yeah...

324
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,030
Now I've got you.

325
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,783
So it's all there?

326
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,287
Chemical matrix,
metabolic rate, DNA spool...

327
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:08,500
Give that to any half decent lab and
we'll have a synthetic on the street

328
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,919
by the end of the week.

329
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,883
EK, waste the freak, please.

330
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
Thank you.

331
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,477
I need my boys ready by Tuesday.

332
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,647
Not a problem.

333
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:39,405
You guarantee they'll be
as strong as Westlake?

334
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,407
I guarantee they'll make you happy.

335
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,952
And happy as they make you,
I'll make you happier.

336
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,416
You want to do it in the lab?

337
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,092
Yes, please.

338
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:02,136
I love when you say please.

339
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,973
Son of a bitch.

340
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,232
Hey, man! Where are you?

341
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,069
You can hide from me...

342
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,738
but you can't...

343
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:24,199
hide from this.

344
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,270
- You ain't so tough.
- Tough enough.

345
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:00,985
You've got an eyeful!

346
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,375
Peter?

347
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:02,253
Angela.

348
00:39:03,296 --> 00:39:09,385
You know Dr Thorne. She's
in the industrial reclamation field.

349
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,637
I'm sure she knows all about thrash.

350
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,391
Actually, I have a PhD in it.

351
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:18,310
Thank you, Doctor.

352
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,279
You have some, um...L ipstick.

353
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,537
How many times have you promised me
no more affairs?

354
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:39,498
And I keep believing you.

355
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,542
- What is it you want?
- Jenny.

356
00:39:43,668 --> 00:39:46,379
She loves you, Peter.
You hardly see her any more.

357
00:39:46,463 --> 00:39:50,675
- She NEEDS you...
- Peter... Peter, we have a problem.

358
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,930
Go home, Angela.
We'll discuss this later.

359
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:03,479
Put him out, please.

360
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:21,080
This Westlake
is beginning to piss me off.

361
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:31,799
So this is where you hide, Rooker.

362
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:50,400
'Where's Mr Bunny?
Oh, he was hiding, huh?'

363
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:55,155
- Why does he hide, huh?
- Will Daddy kiss me good night?

364
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:56,740
Not tonight, honey, OK?

365
00:40:56,823 --> 00:41:00,744
Daddy doesn't love us any more.
Does he, Mom?

366
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:03,580
Oh, honey.

367
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:06,958
It's not that...

368
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:12,213
Daddy has just been very distracted
by his work lately.

369
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:16,467
But things will get better.
I promise, OK?

370
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:25,226
- What about tomorrow night?
- Don't worry. He'll be here, OK?

371
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,819
- Damn!
- You hear something?

372
00:41:37,238 --> 00:41:40,491
Yeah...your mouth.

373
00:41:40,574 --> 00:41:42,618
Shut up.

374
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:52,669
Hello,
Peter Rooker's residence.

375
00:41:52,794 --> 00:41:57,507
He what?
I don't give a shit about Mitchell.

376
00:41:57,632 --> 00:42:00,469
We'll deal with him.
Just do it.

377
00:42:02,262 --> 00:42:04,723
This election's got everybody crazy.

378
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:07,767
I want you to clear my schedule,
everything.

379
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:09,561
Bridget's doing it tomorrow night.

380
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,440
Everything, Peter?

381
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,400
Tomorrow?

382
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,653
What about the other thing
here at the house?

383
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:21,698
- Cancel it.
- That might cause complications.

384
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,950
Just do it.

385
00:42:24,826 --> 00:42:27,745
Peter, it wouldn't be wise.

386
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,914
My skin.

387
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,544
Can you stall them till I get here?

388
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,672
- Of course.
- Thank you, Nico.

389
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:41,550
Gotcha!

390
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:45,971
Cancel it.

391
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:48,223
That might cause complications.

392
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:50,059
Just do it.

393
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:54,062
Do you think you can stall them
till I get here?

394
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:55,272
Of course.

395
00:42:55,397 --> 00:42:59,151
Thank you, Nico. I want you
to clear my schedule, everything.

396
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,820
- Bridget's doing it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

397
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:05,699
Initiating digital scan
of subject photograph.

398
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:09,161
Digitisation complete.

399
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,914
Do you think
you can stall them till I get here?

400
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:15,584
- Of course.
- Thank you, Nico.

401
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,545
I want you to clear
my schedule, everything.

402
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,132
- Bridget's doing it tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? What about...?

403
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:25,552
Do you think
you can stall them...? No!

404
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,435
Do you think
you can stall them...?

405
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,773
Do you think
you can stall them...? No!

406
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:45,237
Do you think you can stall...?

407
00:43:45,363 --> 00:43:49,075
Do you think you can stall them...?

408
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,536
Yes.

409
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:56,373
Beginning three
dimensional photographic imaging.

410
00:43:59,043 --> 00:44:02,379
It's time to meet your match, Rooker.

411
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:07,092
Completed.

412
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,940
Massive perimeter violation.

413
00:44:22,023 --> 00:44:28,405
Multiple intruders in Quadrant B.
Alert. Intruder alert.

414
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:31,908
You've come for me.

415
00:44:31,991 --> 00:44:35,078
Subject mask
synthesis complete.

416
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:40,958
Implementing skin matrix formula
number 2,714.

417
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:49,258
Alert. Inner perimeter violated.

418
00:44:55,097 --> 00:44:58,517
- What's that noise?
- It's coming right at us.

419
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:03,898
- Incoming. Look out!
- Out of the way!

420
00:45:07,026 --> 00:45:08,319
Son of a bitch!

421
00:45:21,248 --> 00:45:22,249
Whoa!

422
00:45:38,723 --> 00:45:42,102
- You missed!
- I'll make it up, Mr Rooker.

423
00:45:43,228 --> 00:45:46,189
Yes, you will.

424
00:45:46,272 --> 00:45:49,442
The serum appears to replicate
Westlake's condition...

425
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,529
by re-aligning
the central nervous system...

426
00:45:56,657 --> 00:46:02,371
causing augmented strength...
fomenting rapid healing.

427
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:07,376
It remains to be seen

428
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,714
if the synthetic
causes the same psychological trauma

429
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:13,966
as seen in subject Westlake.

430
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:01,346
Daddy? Oh, I'm sorry, Daddy.
Don't get mad.

431
00:47:01,429 --> 00:47:04,682
- Why would I?
- You're sleeping at your office.

432
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:07,768
- Right, Daddy?
- Yeah, that's...

433
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:11,147
That's right, Jenny.

434
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,983
Why don't you go back to bed?

435
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:16,652
Yes, Daddy.

436
00:47:17,445 --> 00:47:21,073
Daddy, may I have some
hot chocolate, please?

437
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:24,076
- You know where it is.
- But it's dark.

438
00:47:25,578 --> 00:47:29,331
Haven't you ever been afraid
of the dark?

439
00:47:29,415 --> 00:47:32,751
OK, Jenny,
but Daddy doesn't have much time.

440
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:37,589
Surprise!

441
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:40,258
♪ Happy birthday to you

442
00:47:40,342 --> 00:47:43,679
♪ Happy birthday to you

443
00:47:43,762 --> 00:47:46,056
♪ Happy birthday, dear Peter... ♪

444
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,268
Didn't expect you so soon.
Everything all right?

445
00:47:50,393 --> 00:47:52,145
Yes.

446
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:54,064
Thanks for showing up.

447
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:57,525
Peter, please. Everybody's watching.

448
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,236
Sorry. Would you like a drink?

449
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:05,950
Doesn't that song remind you
of our wedding?

450
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:07,994
We danced all night.

451
00:48:08,077 --> 00:48:11,497
I couldn't find you all night.
You and my maid of honour.

452
00:48:11,581 --> 00:48:14,417
And you forgot
your wedding ring again.

453
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,753
At least you had the sense
to leave her there, too.

454
00:48:17,837 --> 00:48:20,631
- Peter, are you all right?
- Yes...yes.

455
00:48:20,715 --> 00:48:22,341
Attention, everybody.

456
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:26,929
I propose a toast to the guest
of honour, my nephew Peter.

457
00:48:29,682 --> 00:48:32,851
Rooker is fixated
on taking out Mitchell

458
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:35,396
and selling the drug on the street.

459
00:48:37,898 --> 00:48:40,818
But the more I think about it...

460
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:48,492
legitimate medicine offers
a virtually unlimited profit.

461
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:56,792
The underground's peanuts compared
to international pharmaceuticals.

462
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:05,258
Well, I'll just have to
talk him into it.

463
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,219
Like I've talked him
into everything else.

464
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:15,143
Note - call my sources in the drug
industry and get ball park...

465
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:19,605
You scared me.

466
00:49:20,732 --> 00:49:22,817
How long have you been here?

467
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,819
Is there a problem?

468
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:27,989
No, no.

469
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:32,159
Shall we begin?

470
00:49:33,661 --> 00:49:34,954
Let's.

471
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:11,156
Wonderful party, Peter.

472
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:15,827
It's time, Peter.
Everybody wants to hear you play.

473
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,454
- Play?
- For sure.

474
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:19,247
There's never been a celebration

475
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,126
at which my nephew
has not insisted on playing a sonata

476
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:26,754
on his treasured baby grand,
and there never will be, right?

477
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:28,298
Right, yeah.

478
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,508
Play.

479
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:32,802
Come on, Daddy. Play.

480
00:50:42,937 --> 00:50:44,480
Go on, Peter.

481
00:50:45,398 --> 00:50:47,483
Come on, Peter. Play.

482
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:49,193
Play.

483
00:50:52,446 --> 00:50:55,032
Oh, here he goes.

484
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,251
- Uh-huh.
- OK.

485
00:51:24,102 --> 00:51:25,979
So, this shot...

486
00:51:26,062 --> 00:51:28,106
It's going to make us strong, right?

487
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:32,485
As an ox - to match your IQ.

488
00:51:33,778 --> 00:51:36,155
She wants to match my IQ.

489
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,616
Joey, Joey, Joey...

490
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,661
I'm worried the serum may have
psychological side effects.

491
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:44,539
- Meaning?
- We're talking about a new science.

492
00:51:45,122 --> 00:51:47,416
Westlake's nervous system
is different.

493
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,004
They may become belligerent. You
might not be able to control them.

494
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:57,134
Let me worry about that -
just make them strong.

495
00:52:06,352 --> 00:52:09,229
- Warrant?
- Read it and weep, big mouth.

496
00:52:09,313 --> 00:52:11,398
Everybody stay where they are.

497
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:14,151
Take this. Peter?

498
00:52:16,153 --> 00:52:17,696
What's Mitchell doing here?

499
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:21,283
He's here as a civilian observer
until Tuesday's election,

500
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:24,578
when he officially goes to work
smashing your boss's operation.

501
00:52:24,661 --> 00:52:26,705
Tear this place apart.

502
00:52:26,788 --> 00:52:28,790
What's going on, Peter?

503
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:32,419
I'll be in the kitchen. Excuse me.

504
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,105
I gave them a sedative
to keep them quiet

505
00:52:52,188 --> 00:52:55,066
while their nervous systems
adjust to the drug.

506
00:52:57,026 --> 00:52:59,320
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

507
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:07,495
I'll bring you a piece of cake.

508
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,043
It's an intimidation thing.

509
00:53:14,126 --> 00:53:18,839
They're trying to make you look weak
in front of everyone. Stay strong.

510
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:25,512
Look, Mitchell,
I don't want any trouble.

511
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:29,099
That's something you should have
thought of a long time ago.

512
00:53:29,182 --> 00:53:30,517
I'm bringing you down.

513
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,853
Let's not make a big thing.

514
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:35,063
For a good deal,

515
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:38,316
I'll name every criminal operation
in town, how's that?

516
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,696
- Peter? What are you doing?
- I'm not going to jail for anyone.

517
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:47,117
It looks like our informant
was mistaken.

518
00:53:47,784 --> 00:53:50,787
The house is clean.
I apologise for any inconvenience.

519
00:53:52,914 --> 00:53:55,208
Thank you. OK, fellas, let's go.

520
00:53:56,292 --> 00:54:01,005
- I'll call after the election.
- I think we can do business.

521
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:08,554
Jenny, it's your bedtime.

522
00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:14,727
Come on, Daddy.
I've got something for you.

523
00:54:18,564 --> 00:54:22,318
For your birthday. Come on,
Daddy, open it. It's for you.

524
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:43,505
- It's beautiful.
- I made it myself.

525
00:54:43,588 --> 00:54:44,589
You did?

526
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:51,721
Good night, Daddy.

527
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:54,724
I love you. Happy birthday.

528
00:54:57,977 --> 00:54:59,437
Thank you.

529
00:55:13,284 --> 00:55:15,286
Where's my disk?

530
00:55:24,837 --> 00:55:28,340
What is it you want, Peter?
Tucking Jenny in?

531
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:32,511
Playing duets, when you'd never let
her near that piano?

532
00:55:35,597 --> 00:55:37,850
You finally want a divorce,
don't you?

533
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:43,897
You want everyone to see you're a
great father so you'll get custody?

534
00:55:44,982 --> 00:55:47,192
Damn it, look at me.

535
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:50,278
You are not taking Jenny
away from me.

536
00:55:50,362 --> 00:55:51,655
No!

537
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:55,367
- Peter?
- I gotta go.

538
00:55:57,994 --> 00:56:02,415
Is it too much to ask for you
to come see Jenny's play tomorrow?

539
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:22,351
Where's everybody going?
It's my birthday.

540
00:56:22,435 --> 00:56:24,187
See you in hell, Rooker.

541
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:26,063
What? Someone burn the cake?

542
00:56:26,147 --> 00:56:28,983
You'll be lucky
if that's all we burn, Rooker.

543
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:35,281
Nico, what's going on?

544
00:56:35,364 --> 00:56:39,618
Peter, I know you know what you're
doing but this is serious shit.

545
00:56:39,702 --> 00:56:40,869
What?

546
00:56:40,953 --> 00:56:44,289
You just told Mitchell you'd give up
all our people if he cut you a deal.

547
00:56:44,373 --> 00:56:46,667
- Mitchell?.!
- And the whole police force!

548
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,710
- Peter?
- WHAT!?

549
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:50,379
Good night.

550
00:56:50,963 --> 00:56:53,340
I closed up the safe.

551
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:54,841
The safe?!

552
00:56:55,884 --> 00:56:58,428
It's Westlake, you idiot!

553
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:01,223
Westlake?!

554
00:57:06,937 --> 00:57:08,188
Come on!

555
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:11,816
- Man, I feel fucking great!
- Yeah!

556
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,527
You are losing!

557
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:18,406
Not any more, Joey!

558
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:26,789
They're every bit as strong as
Westlake on only half the dose.

559
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:32,753
- Imagine them at full strength.
- I am.

560
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:40,219
Street punks. They think guns make
them strong. Well, they're wrong.

561
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:43,973
You want to make a point stick,
you use your fists.

562
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:51,313
That's enough, children.

563
00:57:54,191 --> 00:57:57,861
Westlake, that son of a bitch
was in my home.

564
00:57:57,986 --> 00:58:00,697
Sold me out
to Mitchell and the cops.

565
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:05,577
No matter what, I'll be there
tomorrow, when he takes that stage

566
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:10,665
and opens his fat mouth to thank
those people for electing him DA.

567
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:18,673
I'll stand and watch these hopped-up
punks rip him limb from limb.

568
00:58:26,848 --> 00:58:31,477
How could the beast tell her?
For the first time he was frightened.

569
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:41,362
Sorry I'm late.

570
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:46,284
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid of anything.

571
00:58:46,367 --> 00:58:50,204
- You dance well.
- As do you, sir.

572
00:58:56,085 --> 00:58:58,379
Get out!

573
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:01,590
Get OUT!

574
00:59:04,343 --> 00:59:08,972
For how could a monstrous creature
ever hope for the love of a woman?

575
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:13,310
Much less one so beautiful? How could
the beast tell her the truth?

576
00:59:34,998 --> 00:59:38,960
- I think you were just wonderful!
- Thank you, Mommy.

577
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:43,006
I didn't think you'd make it.

578
00:59:44,132 --> 00:59:46,009
I came for you and Jenny.

579
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:49,804
That's all we ever wanted, Peter.

580
00:59:49,929 --> 00:59:53,850
I don't believe it, Jenny's play,
dinner at Chez Royale.

581
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:58,646
My God!
What has come over you, Peter?

582
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:01,816
- Hi, Angela!
- Hi!

583
01:00:02,358 --> 01:00:05,444
Jimmy, you were so good!

584
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:06,529
So was Jenny.

585
01:00:06,654 --> 01:00:08,614
I want to introduce you
to my husband.

586
01:00:09,657 --> 01:00:10,950
Peter?

587
01:00:14,703 --> 01:00:17,539
- Another time.
- Yeah, sure.

588
01:00:17,664 --> 01:00:20,334
Bye, Jimmy.

589
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,836
Mom, where did Dad go?

590
01:00:22,961 --> 01:00:24,921
I don't know, honey.

591
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:27,632
Come on, let's go home.

592
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:33,930
I don't care about them. I can't
care. I want my disk back, my work.

593
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,850
It's my life.

594
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,235
Ah, Jenny.

595
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:52,323
God help me.

596
01:00:55,493 --> 01:00:56,869
The whole week before

597
01:00:56,994 --> 01:01:00,540
she couldn't eat, she couldn't sleep,
she was so excited.

598
01:01:02,124 --> 01:01:04,085
Mrs Rooker?

599
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:07,046
Can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

600
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:10,216
Phyllis, I'll talk to you later. Yes?

601
01:01:12,593 --> 01:01:16,222
It's you and Jenny, you have to
get away from your husband.

602
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,599
Excuse me?

603
01:01:18,724 --> 01:01:21,935
I know you don't recognise me,
but I've been to your home.

604
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:26,148
Let me explain.
My name is Peyton Westlake.

605
01:01:26,273 --> 01:01:28,734
- Westlake?
- Yes.

606
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,777
I'm a scientist.

607
01:01:30,944 --> 01:01:33,071
- I know your husband...
- Jenny!

608
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:37,200
- I've been perfecting a liquid skin.
- Get in, honey.

609
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:40,370
I can make masks
to make me look like other people.

610
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:41,872
Is this a joke?

611
01:01:41,997 --> 01:01:43,373
You're not listening.

612
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:47,252
It was me that held your hand
at Jenny's play.

613
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:49,045
You're crazy.

614
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:54,509
The beast was lucky to have
such a beauty.

615
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:56,261
Mommy, who's this?

616
01:01:56,386 --> 01:01:58,054
Honey, be quiet.

617
01:01:58,179 --> 01:02:01,933
- I was with my husband.
- No. You were with me.

618
01:02:03,101 --> 01:02:04,686
Oh, my God!

619
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:06,938
Search your heart, Angela.

620
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:11,317
Angela, please! Take Jenny and get
away from him while you still can.

621
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:13,444
He's dangerous!

622
01:02:15,154 --> 01:02:18,407
- Who was that?
- I don't know, honey.

623
01:02:19,825 --> 01:02:21,535
I don't know.

624
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:36,258
- Honey, go up and do your homework.
- OK, Mom.

625
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:37,759
Peter?

626
01:02:39,386 --> 01:02:40,804
Peter!

627
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:46,393
Nico, ah...where's Peter?
I have to talk to him.

628
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:48,437
He sent me to pick you up.

629
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,482
You're meeting him for dinner,
remember? Chez Royale.

630
01:02:52,566 --> 01:02:54,401
Right.

631
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,873
I found Westlake
and synthesised the drug.

632
01:03:08,957 --> 01:03:12,085
Now that I've given you everything
you wanted...

633
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:15,463
I want what's mine.

634
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:18,299
- I remember.
- Tell me again.

635
01:03:19,133 --> 01:03:23,387
I take my wife to her favourite
restaurant, Chez Royale.

636
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:24,555
And then?

637
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,932
I order her favourite Burgundy.

638
01:03:27,058 --> 01:03:33,063
I don't care about Angela, I can't.
I don't care about anybody else.

639
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,858
I don't give a damn
about anybody else.

640
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,568
'He brings the Burgundy.

641
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,363
I make a heartfelt toast.

642
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,408
- Something goes wrong?
- Something terrible.

643
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,828
But it looks like
a retribution hit.

644
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,247
NO!

645
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:52,082
Retribution hit.

646
01:04:00,966 --> 01:04:02,717
Peyton!

647
01:04:45,134 --> 01:04:46,260
Angela!

648
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:56,311
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

649
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,487
They're beautiful.

650
01:05:07,322 --> 01:05:11,493
Angela. I've been wanting
to do this for a long time.

651
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:17,123
I'm sorry I missed Jenny's play.
I got tied up in a meeting.

652
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:20,668
- I'll make it up to her.
- But...you were late...

653
01:05:20,752 --> 01:05:23,338
I'll make it up to you, too,
I promise.

654
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:27,091
Merango, we'll have the burgundy now,
thank you.

655
01:05:31,304 --> 01:05:34,015
Dr Peyton Westlake
came to see me today.

656
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:38,519
Hmm... Now, isn't that interesting?

657
01:05:39,687 --> 01:05:42,899
So it's all true, isn't it, Peter?
Isn't it?

658
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:45,359
Maximum acceleration achieved.

659
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,365
Peter, I'm leaving you.

660
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:55,244
You and your affairs
and your dirty business deals.

661
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:57,955
And I'm taking Jenny with me.

662
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,749
I don't think so, Angela.

663
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,937
That woman, she... she...

664
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,105
She was my mistress.

665
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,732
You had her killed in front of me.

666
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:30,695
I did it for you, Angela.
I want us to make a new start.

667
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,281
- Please!
- You're insane!

668
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,035
Go!

669
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,667
She's going to get Jenny. Follow her
and bring them both to the site.

670
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:48,171
I have to go and vote now.

671
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,847
Bridget. Where has he taken her?

672
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:04,520
I guess he knew all along
I was using him.

673
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,896
Where is Rooker?

674
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,649
Mitchell's...hit...

675
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:29,002
- Shall we get pumped up?
- Yeah, gimme that.

676
01:07:30,837 --> 01:07:32,172
OK.

677
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:36,968
Come on, come on. Mack, move it.

678
01:07:54,736 --> 01:07:58,281
Rooker. What the hell
are you doing here?

679
01:07:58,364 --> 01:08:01,450
I'm here to celebrate the victory.

680
01:08:01,534 --> 01:08:05,830
I don't know what you're up to, but
until you testify, we still got you.

681
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:08,165
Yes, you do.

682
01:08:12,503 --> 01:08:14,463
Keep an eye on him.

683
01:08:14,547 --> 01:08:17,758
Confidence is running high tonight
in the Mitchell camp.

684
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:20,344
Early results point
towards a landslide win.

685
01:08:20,427 --> 01:08:22,012
Mitchell's strong-man image

686
01:08:22,096 --> 01:08:25,808
seems to have hit a responsive chord
among the voters.

687
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:29,811
Security check, sir.
Sorry, but we have to check everyone.

688
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:46,703
Better than expected.

689
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:49,789
Cool off.

690
01:08:49,914 --> 01:08:54,210
We are ready, Mr Rooker.
I will not fail you again.

691
01:08:54,294 --> 01:08:57,005
Of course not. You know what to do.

692
01:08:57,088 --> 01:09:01,259
Wait till Mitchell is centre stage,
the cameras rolling,

693
01:09:01,342 --> 01:09:03,594
then rip his fucking head off.

694
01:09:06,639 --> 01:09:08,266
Exactly.

695
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:11,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

696
01:09:11,769 --> 01:09:18,484
Candidates Truste and Vans have just
conceded the race to Ryan Mitchell!

697
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,864
It's been a long road.

698
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:27,368
A lot of people worked
very hard for this.

699
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:31,538
Ryan will be here shortly,
so hold on.

700
01:09:31,622 --> 01:09:34,082
This party's just getting started.

701
01:09:37,961 --> 01:09:43,258
Mr Mitchell would like a moment.
He's interested in cutting that deal.

702
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:45,010
He is?

703
01:09:45,093 --> 01:09:47,721
He'd like to see you now.

704
01:10:00,525 --> 01:10:02,902
I want my disk.

705
01:10:07,991 --> 01:10:09,075
Westlake.

706
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:16,290
No more games.
I want my disk and the skin.

707
01:10:16,374 --> 01:10:20,419
And what will you do
if I refuse? Kill me?

708
01:10:20,503 --> 01:10:22,713
I don't think so.
You're not a killer.

709
01:10:22,797 --> 01:10:27,176
- I don't know what I am any more.
- No, you don't.

710
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:29,845
- They're at the site.
- Tell me where.

711
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:33,641
I'll do better than tell you,
I'll show you, my friend.

712
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,645
All right. All right.

713
01:10:39,146 --> 01:10:41,106
You've all been waiting patiently.

714
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:45,194
Here he is, your new DA,
Ryan Mitchell!

715
01:11:02,669 --> 01:11:06,172
- Mitchell.
- Yes, live on television...

716
01:11:06,256 --> 01:11:08,383
with their bare hands.

717
01:11:10,593 --> 01:11:12,595
Nothing like a show of strength

718
01:11:12,679 --> 01:11:16,307
to put the fear of God
in the hearts of children.

719
01:11:16,391 --> 01:11:17,392
With Mitchell gone,

720
01:11:17,475 --> 01:11:22,230
I'll be able to sell that serum on
the open market and make millions.

721
01:11:22,355 --> 01:11:24,273
Thanks to Bridget.

722
01:11:31,155 --> 01:11:34,200
You don't care about Mitchell
any more than I do.

723
01:11:35,076 --> 01:11:37,369
Let's hear it for Mr Mitchell!

724
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:41,040
The people have spoken.
This is your victory.

725
01:11:41,123 --> 01:11:45,044
If you want the disk,
you'll have to come after me.

726
01:11:45,127 --> 01:11:46,837
Offer of a lifetime?

727
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,431
My friends...

728
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:05,397
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

729
01:12:06,148 --> 01:12:09,484
- Keep it moving.
- Get back up.

730
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:13,863
Come on!

731
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,326
Moving on track seven,
approaching transfer.

732
01:13:28,978 --> 01:13:32,190
- Stay still. Everything's OK.
- Please, Jenny shouldn't be here.

733
01:13:32,273 --> 01:13:34,317
Please, don't hurt her.

734
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,946
She has to stay, understand,
Mrs Rooker? She has to stay.

735
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:43,451
I won't hurt her, Mrs Rooker,
just stand still.

736
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:45,953
Everything will be perfectly OK.

737
01:13:57,506 --> 01:13:59,091
- Angela!
- Peyton!

738
01:13:59,175 --> 01:14:01,635
No need to shout, French fry.

739
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:08,392
Angela! Jenny! Hold on!

740
01:14:08,475 --> 01:14:10,978
You've been a bad boy!

741
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,232
He's mine, Mack.

742
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:21,863
Again! You getting too much sun.

743
01:14:32,999 --> 01:14:35,335
Joey!

744
01:14:36,461 --> 01:14:38,505
What's happening?

745
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:42,300
Fight me, you bastard!

746
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,984
Need a lift, tough guy?

747
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:26,510
Gotcha!

748
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:33,475
What the...?

749
01:15:34,434 --> 01:15:35,519
Whoa!

750
01:15:42,317 --> 01:15:44,194
Angela!

751
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:47,238
Hold it right there, Doc!

752
01:15:47,322 --> 01:15:53,036
A gun? Tough guy like you? I thought
you'd want to do this man to man.

753
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:55,997
Since when were you considered a man?

754
01:15:56,706 --> 01:16:00,209
Freak!
I suppose you're looking for this?

755
01:16:01,711 --> 01:16:03,671
No!

756
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:08,384
Pretty good shooting, huh? Step back.

757
01:16:11,721 --> 01:16:14,724
And I know you're looking for this.

758
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:20,771
The only sample.
Just enough for your ugly face.

759
01:16:22,147 --> 01:16:25,651
But I don't think you'll be needing
that any longer, Doc.

760
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:39,831
Angela.

761
01:16:39,956 --> 01:16:41,750
I couldn't let him hurt you.

762
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,710
Let's get Jenny and go.

763
01:16:43,877 --> 01:16:45,128
NO!

764
01:16:46,963 --> 01:16:51,343
Let me be, Angela. I'm a new man now.
Stronger than ever!

765
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:56,181
You tried to kill me. My own wife.

766
01:16:56,306 --> 01:16:59,476
That was not nice!

767
01:17:07,317 --> 01:17:09,777
It's your wake-up call, Doc!

768
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:19,036
Peter, God, no!

769
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:28,212
Ride 'em, cowboy!

770
01:17:30,214 --> 01:17:33,384
- Daddy, don't!
- Jenny, get back! Get back!

771
01:17:33,509 --> 01:17:35,636
Don't hurt him, Daddy!

772
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:49,816
Jenny, please! God, no! God!

773
01:17:58,033 --> 01:18:01,620
It's OK. It's OK, baby. Just hold on.

774
01:18:15,883 --> 01:18:20,263
God, no! Please...please, honey!

775
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:56,423
Welcome to Rooker World!

776
01:19:02,846 --> 01:19:03,972
My skin!

777
01:19:07,934 --> 01:19:09,227
Gotcha!

778
01:19:27,203 --> 01:19:32,375
You always talk about strength,
but a strong man loves his wife...

779
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,293
takes care of his children.

780
01:19:34,418 --> 01:19:36,295
Come on. Come on.

781
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:50,809
Gotcha, you bastard!

782
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:55,147
Peyton!

783
01:20:01,028 --> 01:20:02,404
Good.

784
01:20:08,327 --> 01:20:12,414
Angela, we've gotta get out of here.
It's going to explode!

785
01:20:16,042 --> 01:20:18,628
Come. Come. Let's go.

786
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,590
Let's go. Run!

787
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:25,468
Run!

788
01:20:39,023 --> 01:20:43,277
This is a code three. Burn unit
ready. This is a code three.

789
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:46,364
- Vital signs OK?
- Yes, Doctor.

790
01:20:46,447 --> 01:20:47,949
Get her to ER.

791
01:20:48,074 --> 01:20:51,619
We'll get the best graft
from here, here and here.

792
01:20:51,702 --> 01:20:53,537
We're not using skin grafts.

793
01:20:53,621 --> 01:20:56,624
- Who the hell are you?
- Dr Westlake, burn specialist.

794
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:09,386
Everything's going to be OK, Jenny.

795
01:21:47,632 --> 01:21:50,134
- Dr Westlake?
- I have to go.

796
01:21:54,055 --> 01:21:55,431
Wait.

797
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:14,867
Peyton!

798
01:22:40,684 --> 01:22:42,519
Angela!

799
01:22:44,771 --> 01:22:47,107
Please, don't follow me.

800
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:51,319
I just want to see you...
the way you really are.

801
01:22:52,528 --> 01:22:55,657
- Why?
- I need to see the man...

802
01:22:57,158 --> 01:22:59,202
the man who saved my child.

803
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:05,291
Please.

804
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,322
Thank you.

805
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:46,957
As close as she came,
she was still miles away.

806
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:50,085
So I continued my journeys alone -
into the darkness.
