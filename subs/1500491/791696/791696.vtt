1
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.397
Hey, are you gooks almost done?

2
00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:52.821
Faggot.

3
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:06.126
- You are big motherfucker, yes?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:30.150
Just moments ago, a full-scale riot broke out
at Terminal Island Penitentiary.

5
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.986
As far as I can tell,
there has been no action taken

6
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.155
<i>by Terminal Island Prison
correction officers.</i>

7
00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:36.990
Lock down the bridge,
keep the tower guards.

8
00:02:37.074 --> 00:02:39.493
I want everyone else down here now.

9
00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:45.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.258
Of course I'm serious!
Patch me live right fucking now!

11
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.845
Either you take me live
or I tell your wife everything.

12
00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.355
You got that, right?

13
00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.072
What a shit match.

14
00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.868
I would never have bet
if I knew Spiro was injured.

15
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.121
- But you did, huh?
- Yeah. Take your winnings.

16
00:04:07.247 --> 00:04:10.709
The whole world's falling apart,
and Manchester United with it.

17
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.505
When I came over here,

18
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:19.050
that clip was the first thing I ever bought
with my own money, you know?

19
00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:23.013
So, you take care of it. You look after it.

20
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:28.310
Look at you, profiting off football.
He's never watched a match in his life.

21
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.978
That's 'cause it's fucking boring, that's why.

22
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.521
The world's greatest game.

23
00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.440
I think it's the third
world's greatest game, right?

24
00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.069
What the fuck are you laughing at?

25
00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.531
Excuse us, please.

26
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:48.830
About the bank,

27
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:51.541
it's important to me.

28
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.044
I know it is.

29
00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.630
That's why I want to handle it my way,
with my guys.

30
00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.591
Well, Vinnie brought me this score.

31
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.179
My stipulation is that you're in charge,
which is the way I want it.

32
00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:07.557
- Can I count on you?
- What do you think?

33
00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:10.477
Yeah.

34
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.522
I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green,

35
00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:17.025
but what my nephew lacks in experience,
he makes up for with enthusiasm.

36
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.318
Exactly what I'm worried about.

37
00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.364
Look, he fucks up, Mr. Kane,
he answers to me, okay?

38
00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.285
It's going to be all right, Luke. Trust me.

39
00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:28.578
Always do.

40
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:32.749
I know you do.

41
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.918
Come on. I've got something to show you.

42
00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:46.221
What do you think?

43
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.348
This is for me?

44
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.852
- You don't like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

45
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:53.979
I just think, maybe, you know,
based on the kind of work I do,

46
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.565
you don't think it's a bit orange?

47
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:59.317
- You don't fucking like it.
- Are you kidding me?

48
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.735
She's stunning.

49
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:05.866
I just wonder, you think I might
stand out in this thing?

50
00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.493
No, the more obvious you are,
the less suspicious you appear.

51
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.829
So, like, hiding in plain sight kind of thing.

52
00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:12.581
Precisely.

53
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:15.542
Okay.

54
00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.134
Don't fuck it up.

55
00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:08.803
Thank you both for coming.

56
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:12.223
Mr. Weyland, I'm not exactly sure
why she's here,

57
00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.810
but I know why I am, sir. I've failed you
and I've disgraced the corporation.

58
00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.312
Relax.

59
00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:21.149
I'm surprised those animals
don't kill each other with more regularity.

60
00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:23.318
You're both here
because this incident has created

61
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.070
a public relations nightmare for me.

62
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.324
Was something I said funny?

63
00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.079
Well, you had a 48 share.

64
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:38.458
Your network's previous high was a seven.

65
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:42.462
What you call a nightmare
I'd call a wet dream.

66
00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:49.678
Mr. Weyland, I know that the network
isn't your prime moneymaker.

67
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.766
But I can't believe that you don't realise
what a gold mine you're sitting on.

68
00:07:55.684 --> 00:07:57.644
Humour me, Miss Jones.

69
00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.021
People are tired of fake violence

70
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:03.775
and fights staged by Vegas promoters.

71
00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:06.611
The hatred that your inmates have

72
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:11.032
is pure. Can't be duplicated.

73
00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:14.619
You're calling what happened today
entertainment?

74
00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:15.954
Ah!

75
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.834
What exactly do you have in mind?

76
00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.714
No, seriously, I gotta tell you,

77
00:08:25.797 --> 00:08:29.300
this motherfucker's never carried a gun
in 20 years working for my uncle.

78
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.302
- That right, Luke?
- Vinnie, pay attention.

79
00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:33.888
You got 60 seconds. You get in, you get out.

80
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.016
- No one gets hurt.
- We know. Don't worry.

81
00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.341
We got company. Get out of there.

82
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.593
Vinnie, you copy?

83
00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.095
<i>Don't worry about it, man.
Don't stress out.</i>

84
00:09:15.096 --> 00:09:17.140
- Look, abort. Get out of there.
<i>- Chill, man.</i>

85
00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:19.809
Jonesy, abort. Abort. Get out of there.

86
00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:21.561
<i>- It's under control.</i>
- Fuck.

87
00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:32.989
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!

88
00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:34.657
Freeze!

89
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.452
- Freeze!
- What the fuck?

90
00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:39.412
Hey!

91
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.925
Fucking idiot!

92
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.805
Twenty years and nobody got hurt.

93
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.681
You. Dumb fuck.

94
00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.308
We're leaving now! Move!

95
00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:03.353
- Shit!
- Fuck!

96
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.022
- Shit! God damn it!
- Go, go, go, man!

97
00:10:06.523 --> 00:10:07.690
Come on, let's move!

98
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:09.692
Fuck this, then.

99
00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.282
What are you looking at? Stop!

100
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.159
You're crazy!

101
00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:20.370
- Move!
- Freeze!

102
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:06.583
Let's get the fuck out of here!

103
00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:25.852
Go. Go, go, go, go!

104
00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:27.729
- Get in the fucking car, Vinnie.
- Right.

105
00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:29.230
- Move!
- Gotta go!

106
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:40.783
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

107
00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:42.911
You're going to get us fucking killed,
like Terry.

108
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.750
The only motherfucker that got Terry killed
was you. Fucking relax!

109
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:34.796
We're gonna blast our way through.

110
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.714
No one's getting blasted,
you fucking understand me?

111
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.428
They're gaining on us.
Luke, fuck, I ain't getting pinched.

112
00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.389
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

113
00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.296
What the fuck was that for?

114
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.256
- Fuck you.
- Drop the fucking gun.

115
00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:20.842
- Make a choice.
- Fuck.

116
00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:23.303
Your uncle is family.

117
00:13:23.386 --> 00:13:26.014
It's the only fucking reason
you guys are walking from this. Get out.

118
00:13:26.681 --> 00:13:27.932
Get out the fucking car!

119
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.120
<i>Chefs from Season 1
are back for redemption.</i>

120
00:13:49.203 --> 00:13:50.830
<i>...and it appears there's even more...</i>

121
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.041
<i>...bank robbery suspect
is caught red-handed...</i>

122
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.793
<i>Well, that's still
yet to be confirmed, I'm afraid, Ron,</i>

123
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:59.047
<i>as busy King Street
is starting to get back to normal right now.</i>

124
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:03.718
<i>Just a few hours ago, it was the scene
of high tension as gunfire rang...</i>

125
00:14:23.905 --> 00:14:26.366
<i>Of the four suspects,
one has been identified</i>

126
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.534
<i>as Carl Lucas, who is a known associate</i>

127
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.745
<i>- of alleged crime boss Markus Kane.</i>
- Fuck!

128
00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:35.208
<i>- We will now take you live downtown...</i>
- Fucking hell!

129
00:15:31.722 --> 00:15:33.099
Stay where you are!

130
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:41.232
Hands up!

131
00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:49.532
Take a last look at the mainland, boys.

132
00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.368
You ain't gonna see her again
once we cross this bridge.

133
00:15:52.452 --> 00:15:55.455
Bridges.
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest,

134
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.498
38-and-a-half kilometres long,

135
00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.169
followed by Donghai Bridge,
32-and-a-half kilometres long.

136
00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:05.339
- The King Fahd Causeway comes in third.
- Fucking mumbling, stuttering bastard.

137
00:16:06.257 --> 00:16:08.718
- Could you shut the fuck up?
- Leave him alone.

138
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:10.928
Prattling on every 10 minutes.

139
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.973
- I'm getting sick and fucking tired of you.
- He's scared.

140
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:16.559
What do you care?

141
00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.187
I don't.

142
00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.197
All right! Let's move!

143
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.242
Get out! Get out!

144
00:16:34.202 --> 00:16:37.497
Move! Come on, move!
Get out here! Get out here!

145
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.208
Get the fuck off me.

146
00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:42.251
Come on, get out. Come on now.

147
00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.624
<i>I will not testify. Never.</i>

148
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:05.710
<i>The DA's gonna pull his offer, Luke.</i>

149
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.171
<i>Kane'll walk away scot-free,
and you'll go away for life.</i>

150
00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.259
<i>You see, I'm not gonna testify
against Markus Kane.</i>

151
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:16.345
<i>Not for immunity, not for money,</i>

152
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.766
<i>not for anything.</i>

153
00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.694
We have some good news, Mr. Kane.
We found Luke.

154
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:35.323
- He's on the Island.
- That is good news.

155
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:38.200
Always knew I could trust that guy.

156
00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:41.871
I told you. No way would he betray me.

157
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:49.712
Have him taken out.

158
00:18:50.463 --> 00:18:52.048
You're joking, right?

159
00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.175
So far, he hasn't played ball with the feds.

160
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.429
He's in for life. What happens
after a month of hard time, eh?

161
00:18:59.055 --> 00:19:01.557
After a couple of them African apes
have a go at him.

162
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.727
How long do you think
he's gonna stay loyal then?

163
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.355
You know, it's a shame,

164
00:19:08.981 --> 00:19:11.067
'cause I love that guy like a brother.

165
00:19:16.072 --> 00:19:17.490
Anything else?

166
00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:19.116
No, sir.

167
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:24.038
- What else do you want on this?
- It's perfect.

168
00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:26.207
- Yeah? Here, then.
- Thank you.

169
00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:09.166
Fuck you!

170
00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:25.015
The average <i>Death Match</i> fight
garners a 50 share.

171
00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:28.769
It peaked two months ago at 62,
but has been on the decline since.

172
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.356
The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill,
with a death count of 19,

173
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.691
followed by 14K,

174
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.902
- who, coincidentally, has 14 kills.
- Great, man.

175
00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:38.529
Someone did their homework, right?

176
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.531
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

177
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.911
That's September Jones.
Former Miss Universe.

178
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:50.458
Was stripped of her crown after allegations
of a sexual relationship with all five judges.

179
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.918
Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting
as a weather girl,

180
00:20:53.127 --> 00:20:55.713
is now the host and executive producer
of <i>Death Match.</i>

181
00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.423
She grew a...

182
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:01.385
You have a list pretty much ready to go
on anything, don't you?

183
00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:07.892
<i>Live from Terminal Island,
television's most violent, most disturbing,</i>

184
00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.478
<i>and most watched programme
in human history.</i>

185
00:21:11.312 --> 00:21:13.314
<i>Welcome to</i> Death Match.

186
00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:19.153
<i>Our first fighter, a murderer serving
four consecutive life sentences,</i>

187
00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.239
<i>Xander Grady!</i>

188
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:26.327
<i>Xander,
11 kills, one submission.</i>

189
00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:30.080
<i>6'4", 220 pounds.</i>

190
00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:35.795
<i>His opponent,
leader of the Terminal Island Triads,</i>

191
00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:38.422
<i>he currently ranks second on the kill board,</i>

192
00:21:38.506 --> 00:21:42.927
<i>he was Interpol's third most wanted
until his arrest in Los Angeles last year,</i>

193
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:44.845
<i>14K!</i>

194
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:50.434
<i>14K, one submission, 14 kills.</i>

195
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.104
<i>5'11", 159 pounds.</i>

196
00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:58.818
<i>The combatants are picked by lottery
randomly each week.</i>

197
00:21:59.276 --> 00:22:03.280
<i>There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.</i>

198
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:06.200
<i>There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,</i>

199
00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:09.286
<i>can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.</i>

200
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.498
<i>But they only have 10 seconds
to access them.</i>

201
00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:15.459
<i>If no fighter has won,
both fighters are killed.</i>

202
00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:18.712
<i>Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.</i>

203
00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.472
You're number one!

204
00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:30.558
You're number one!

205
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:33.185
Yo, baby, you're my number one!

206
00:22:34.895 --> 00:22:36.313
Chinese bastard!

207
00:23:08.596 --> 00:23:09.597
Something's not right.

208
00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:12.558
What're you talking about?

209
00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:18.063
Die!

210
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:12.117
14K! 14K! 14K! 14K!

211
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:18.123
You want it? Huh?

212
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:24.630
Let go, man!

213
00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.800
I will never give up!

214
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.979
- He quit!
- No!

215
00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:43.148
Another fucking submission!

216
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:44.984
He quit!

217
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:48.862
- 14K! 14K!
<i>- Tonight's winner,</i>

218
00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:52.324
<i>14K!</i>

219
00:24:56.829 --> 00:24:59.957
Death Match <i>is a trademark
of Weyland International.</i>

220
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.461
<i>Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.</i>

221
00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.805
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you are doing?

222
00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.517
You are done.
Done!

223
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:36.994
Lights out!

224
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.511
Hey, baby.

225
00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:56.930
The numbers from the overnights are in.

226
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.393
What do I pay you for?

227
00:26:01.894 --> 00:26:04.605
The ratings are down again. This time, 20%.

228
00:26:05.856 --> 00:26:09.276
Now, you better reverse the trend,
or I'll find someone who can.

229
00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:11.612
Are you sure?

230
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:19.578
Yes, I'm sure. Now, you make my
motherfucking money. You understand me?

231
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:31.423
It's a strict Triad code.

232
00:26:31.882 --> 00:26:35.761
Whoever spills the blood of a Triad,
they're sworn to take that person's life.

233
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.805
Xander killed a Triad last match.

234
00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:40.307
It defies logic why he wouldn't kill him
if he had the chance.

235
00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:42.559
Hey, kid,
I'm not looking for a best friend, okay?

236
00:26:42.643 --> 00:26:44.144
So, just leave me alone.

237
00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:17.594
Carl Lucas.

238
00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:20.430
- Chill. Chill, man.
- Relax.

239
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:23.517
You've been assigned to our work detail.

240
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.810
That's Rocco,

241
00:27:25.352 --> 00:27:26.395
I'm Goldberg.

242
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.356
- Goldberg, huh?
- Yeah.

243
00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:32.025
What are you, like, the...
You, like, the last Mexican Jew, or what?

244
00:27:33.235 --> 00:27:35.362
Yeah. I killed all the rest.

245
00:27:37.239 --> 00:27:40.159
Okay. So, this work detail,
what are we looking at?

246
00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:42.369
And don't tell me we're washing underwear.

247
00:27:42.995 --> 00:27:44.913
- No.
- I don't care what you're into.

248
00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:47.040
I'm not washing anybody's underwear.

249
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:51.545
On your feet, Lucas. Warden wants you.

250
00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:23.410
That'll be all.

251
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:29.833
Carl Lucas, arrested 22 times
over a span of 20 years.

252
00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:32.711
But nothing ever stuck,
not a single damn one.

253
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:35.547
You just slipped through the cracks.

254
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:38.842
Well, I shot a cop.

255
00:28:39.801 --> 00:28:41.803
Those cracks, they fill up pretty fast.

256
00:28:42.221 --> 00:28:43.639
They sure do. Yeah.

257
00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:47.100
Now, at first I didn't realise who you were.

258
00:28:47.434 --> 00:28:49.937
Really? So, who am I?

259
00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:52.856
Well, an idiot, and soon a dead man.

260
00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:56.526
DA offers you a talk-and-walk,
and you turn him down?

261
00:28:57.194 --> 00:28:58.695
Is that why you got me here?

262
00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:00.948
No, it's not. I'm here to warn you.

263
00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:03.700
- Save your breath.
- Oh, don't get smart with me.

264
00:29:03.784 --> 00:29:05.619
I don't know how many others know
who you are,

265
00:29:05.827 --> 00:29:07.120
but when the word gets out,

266
00:29:07.579 --> 00:29:09.581
the killers are gonna be
coming out of the woodwork.

267
00:29:10.374 --> 00:29:11.416
Is that right?

268
00:29:13.377 --> 00:29:14.419
And mark my words,

269
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:17.506
Markus Kane will not show you the
same type of loyalty that you've shown him.

270
00:29:32.646 --> 00:29:36.358
Look, 14K kills Xander,

271
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:38.568
he makes him a martyr. That's like an honour.

272
00:29:39.194 --> 00:29:42.990
Xander quits,
shames himself and the entire brotherhood.

273
00:29:43.573 --> 00:29:46.118
That makes him like a pussy.

274
00:29:47.035 --> 00:29:48.203
You got him, guys?

275
00:29:49.162 --> 00:29:50.205
Yeah.

276
00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:52.040
Oh, man.

277
00:29:52.291 --> 00:29:55.085
I got a question. All these cars, man,
it's not exactly prison norm.

278
00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:56.253
What's the deal?

279
00:29:56.586 --> 00:30:00.215
Hey, Terminal Island is not
about rehabilitation. You know what I mean?

280
00:30:01.049 --> 00:30:04.928
It's a business.
All these cars, we melt them down,

281
00:30:05.012 --> 00:30:07.681
make weapons, guns, shells.

282
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:10.434
If it kills, we make it.

283
00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.188
Hey, are you telling me the government's
paying top dollar for this recycled shit?

284
00:30:15.272 --> 00:30:17.899
Top dollar?
Who said anything about top dollar?

285
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:20.819
Weyland International sells this stuff
dirt-cheap.

286
00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.237
Yeah, when you're not paying for labour,

287
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:24.531
your prices can afford to be a little lower,
you know what I mean?

288
00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:27.117
They're making money off our blood.

289
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.704
- What do you know about these wheels?
- A little bit.

290
00:30:32.122 --> 00:30:34.708
- How does she run?
- Why don't you see what she's got?

291
00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:42.716
- For real?
- For real.

292
00:30:43.717 --> 00:30:44.885
Why not?

293
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.083
Someone's been driving a getaway car!

294
00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.711
God damn,
you put some magic in this thing.

295
00:32:02.504 --> 00:32:04.965
- How does she handle?
- Just the way she's supposed to.

296
00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:06.591
Who was driving that car?

297
00:32:07.634 --> 00:32:08.885
- What car?
- What car?

298
00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.356
Hey, Luke, you a fighter?

299
00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:23.608
I got no reason to fight anyone.

300
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:26.820
Hey, reasons don't mean shit in this place.

301
00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.489
The Calendar's always looking
for new blood,

302
00:32:29.573 --> 00:32:31.533
and you look like just her type.

303
00:32:31.992 --> 00:32:33.243
Good to know.

304
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:46.715
Some advice, blend in.
Don't give her no reason to fixate on you.

305
00:32:47.007 --> 00:32:49.759
Hey, Goldberg, I'm the last guy
looking for a fucking spotlight.

306
00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:54.139
- Hey!
- Hey!

307
00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:57.309
Stay back! Stay back!

308
00:32:57.726 --> 00:32:58.852
Everybody else stay back!

309
00:33:01.313 --> 00:33:02.564
I don't want you in there. Move back.

310
00:33:03.106 --> 00:33:05.984
All of you, stay back! Let's go! Move back!

311
00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.836
- What's going on here?
- Big guy tripped.

312
00:33:25.003 --> 00:33:27.756
- That so, Bill?
- Yeah, I tripped.

313
00:33:29.257 --> 00:33:30.425
That's what he says.

314
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.260
All right, let's go! Keep it moving!

315
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:33.970
- Come on, move!
- Get moving! Move! Move!

316
00:33:35.055 --> 00:33:36.139
Who's the little guy?

317
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:38.433
- His name's Lists.
- Lists?

318
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.895
You'll work it out.

319
00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:48.068
You ever hear of a computer?
You're, like, a century behind everyone.

320
00:33:48.276 --> 00:33:50.362
I'm surprised I don't find an abacus in here.

321
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:52.906
- What are you doing in my office?
- I'm here for him.

322
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:55.951
Carl Lucas.
Even the name gives me a hard-on.

323
00:33:56.785 --> 00:34:00.872
The judge called him a monster at his trial.
He's perfect.

324
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:03.375
- I can sell him.
- You can't have him.

325
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:06.294
- I wasn't asking your permission.
- Wait. There's more to it.

326
00:34:06.628 --> 00:34:08.129
DA thinks there's a chance

327
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:12.259
that he could turn state witness
against Markus Kane.

328
00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:15.762
Now, you put him on your TV show,

329
00:34:15.845 --> 00:34:17.347
not only could those animals kill him,

330
00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:22.644
but basically, he just advertises to Kane
where the chief witness against him sleeps,

331
00:34:23.395 --> 00:34:24.854
and then he's a dead man.

332
00:34:26.439 --> 00:34:28.108
Mr. Lucas' problem, not mine.

333
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.987
Warden Parks, you and your prison
exist for one reason,

334
00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:35.031
to facilitate <i>Death Match.</i>

335
00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:39.160
And here I thought we were here
to protect society and punish criminals.

336
00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.289
Then you're dumber than I thought.

337
00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:32.797
Give us a minute.

338
00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:38.845
Would you like a towel?

339
00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:42.432
I'm fine.

340
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:44.601
Yeah, I'll say.

341
00:35:46.436 --> 00:35:48.188
Very impressive.

342
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:52.108
And your fight with Big Bill yesterday,

343
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.028
also impressive.

344
00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:58.948
- I don't think we've met. I'm...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

345
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:02.410
Save the sales pitch, huh?

346
00:36:02.744 --> 00:36:03.828
I'm not fighting.

347
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:08.291
If I want you to fight, you fight.

348
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:09.751
- Is that right?
- Yes.

349
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:13.463
I can't do anything about the life sentences,

350
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:16.049
but you participate,

351
00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:19.719
and I will make your life here
much more tolerable.

352
00:36:22.305 --> 00:36:24.724
Your own cell, no work detail,

353
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:27.686
real food,

354
00:36:29.979 --> 00:36:31.398
as well as plenty of

355
00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.155
- perks.
- Okay.

356
00:36:41.324 --> 00:36:42.617
So, I...

357
00:36:47.914 --> 00:36:50.125
I win some fights for you,

358
00:36:51.501 --> 00:36:53.878
you need another guy to beat me.

359
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.007
I mean, that's...

360
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:00.677
That's how it works, right?

361
00:37:03.138 --> 00:37:04.222
Yeah.

362
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.101
Okay.

363
00:37:10.854 --> 00:37:11.938
Hey,

364
00:37:13.273 --> 00:37:15.400
go sell sleazy someplace else,

365
00:37:18.278 --> 00:37:19.487
'cause I ain't buying.

366
00:37:21.281 --> 00:37:24.159
- You won't leave me any choice.
- Do what you gotta do.

367
00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:26.494
I'm not gonna be a part of your freak show.

368
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.164
We'll see.

369
00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:34.294
Hey.

370
00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.130
You don't hear the word "no" so often,
do you?

371
00:37:38.006 --> 00:37:39.674
Only when I say it.

372
00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:48.016
<i>Dim the lights,
the carnage is about to begin.</i>

373
00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:51.478
<i>Good evening,
and welcome to</i> Death Match.

374
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:57.275
<i>Two men will be randomly selected live,
right before your eyes.</i>

375
00:37:57.525 --> 00:37:59.402
Only the winner walks out alive.

376
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.906
Are there any fighters in here tonight?

377
00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:20.507
I need one more.

378
00:38:31.226 --> 00:38:33.019
No! No!

379
00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:34.354
This is fucking bullshit.

380
00:38:34.938 --> 00:38:36.564
<i>Welcome to</i> Death Match.

381
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:41.319
Hey! Hey, lady. Okay, you made your point.

382
00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:44.155
- Switch us up.
- Oh, so now you wanna fight?

383
00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:46.449
Fucking right. They're gonna kill him
in there, you know that.

384
00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:48.952
Yeah, I certainly hope so.
The name of the game is <i>Death Match.</i>

385
00:38:49.077 --> 00:38:50.328
What the fuck is wrong with you?

386
00:38:50.411 --> 00:38:52.872
Hey! Get your fucking hands...

387
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:57.293
<i>There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.</i>

388
00:38:57.794 --> 00:39:00.129
<i>There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,</i>

389
00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:02.924
<i>can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.</i>

390
00:39:03.424 --> 00:39:07.470
<i>And this week, we have a new weapon
that will blow your mind.</i>

391
00:39:11.391 --> 00:39:12.475
Come on!

392
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.442
Fuck him up, Bill!

393
00:39:25.488 --> 00:39:27.073
Come on! Come on!

394
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.872
Mother...

395
00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.798
Motherfucker's crazy!

396
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.258
But cool.

397
00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.022
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I want on the floor. Can you help?

398
00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:10.700
Get him, Luke!

399
00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:37.977
Watch out!

400
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:40.104
Watch out!

401
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:53.660
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

402
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.706
Don't look good for our boy.

403
00:41:04.462 --> 00:41:06.547
This way! This way! Come on!

404
00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:12.595
The door, Luke! The door!

405
00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:16.265
This is some bullshit! This game is rigged!

406
00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:21.104
- Barbecue his white ass!
- Yo, the white boy's cheating!

407
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:24.148
- Fucking cracker's cheating!
- Fuck you, you nigger!

408
00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.942
- You piece of shit!
- Watch out!

409
00:41:37.578 --> 00:41:38.621
Come on!

410
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.506
Come on! Let's get in there!

411
00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:54.220
Come on, come on! Go, go! Get out there!

412
00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:55.972
I told you.

413
00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.022
Switch!

414
00:42:25.543 --> 00:42:26.586
Go, go, go!

415
00:42:36.929 --> 00:42:39.724
Get the fuck over here!
Come on! Come on!

416
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:40.933
Get back.

417
00:42:46.022 --> 00:42:47.065
Watch out, Luke!

418
00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:13.591
Get ready to scream, bitch!

419
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:23.017
- Fuck you!
- Who's screaming now, bitch?

420
00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:24.769
Code red, arena stage.

421
00:43:25.228 --> 00:43:27.772
- End transmission now.
- Are you fucking crazy?

422
00:43:27.855 --> 00:43:30.316
- Shut it down.
- No way. This is my show.

423
00:43:30.399 --> 00:43:33.111
And this is my prison.
End this broadcast now

424
00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.488
or you're gonna be one of the cons
instead of just filming them.

425
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:36.697
Got it.

426
00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:39.158
Death Match <i>is a trademark
of Weyland International.</i>

427
00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:42.161
<i>Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.</i>

428
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:46.874
Get on the ground!

429
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:50.086
Luke!

430
00:43:52.505 --> 00:43:53.631
Come on, get on the bus!

431
00:43:57.176 --> 00:43:58.845
You wanna live? Stay down.

432
00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.213
Wasn't that Luke?

433
00:44:36.257 --> 00:44:37.300
What?

434
00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.428
Fuck!

435
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:42.346
Get me the phone!

436
00:44:43.055 --> 00:44:44.098
Fuck.

437
00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:47.560
Just relax, huh? Just relax.
Won't hurt a bit. Relax.

438
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.063
Any closer, buddy...

439
00:44:51.147 --> 00:44:53.733
You're really lucky,
or this would have hit the femoral artery.

440
00:44:54.108 --> 00:44:57.778
- Yeah, that's me. Lucky.
- Yeah. You can say that.

441
00:44:59.155 --> 00:45:02.408
- Man!
- Just relax. Relax.

442
00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:08.873
It's a minor setback.
A few rapists and murderers died. Boo-hoo.

443
00:45:09.081 --> 00:45:10.499
No. This is the end.

444
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.711
You messed it up by pulling the plug.
We would've won the night.

445
00:45:15.338 --> 00:45:17.632
You're not good enough in bed
to win this one.

446
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:22.136
Sweet dreams.

447
00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:33.897
Come on, over here.

448
00:45:35.107 --> 00:45:36.150
Fuck.

449
00:45:36.734 --> 00:45:38.444
Sit down there and shut up.

450
00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:42.865
- Quiet down.
- Hey.

451
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.700
What happened?

452
00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.662
You're not the only one
that got in some good shots.

453
00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:51.666
- I know.
- All right, ladies! Line it up!

454
00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:54.543
The bus is leaving.
Don't make me tell you twice!

455
00:45:59.298 --> 00:46:00.466
- Hey.
- Let's go.

456
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:02.969
- Thanks, huh?
- Step through, ladies!

457
00:46:03.511 --> 00:46:05.096
Yeah. I don't know why I did it.

458
00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:07.640
Probably get thrown in the hole for that.

459
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:11.686
Then why?

460
00:46:12.561 --> 00:46:14.063
Why did you help that con?

461
00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:17.942
Wasn't gonna let the man fight my fight.

462
00:46:19.235 --> 00:46:20.987
Right this way. Let's go.

463
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:27.159
You got a name?

464
00:46:27.493 --> 00:46:29.954
Uh-huh. Yeah. Of course I do.

465
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.626
Come on, man.

466
00:46:37.503 --> 00:46:38.838
There he is.

467
00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:46.220
How the fuck is he still alive?

468
00:46:46.304 --> 00:46:47.888
Boss, we've been assured it's happening.

469
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:49.598
It's been happening for weeks now.

470
00:46:49.974 --> 00:46:51.976
How much longer
do you think he's gonna stay silent?

471
00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.061
He's a tough guy, and he's been loyal...

472
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:56.022
I want him dead!

473
00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:58.357
We have someone on the inside,
a total psycho.

474
00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:00.526
- It won't take long now.
- Joey. Joey.

475
00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.282
The box, with its implications
of rigidity and squareness,

476
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:11.329
symbolises unimaginative thinking
and painful frustration.

477
00:47:19.545 --> 00:47:21.839
<i>Sometimes we just have to step back,</i>

478
00:47:21.922 --> 00:47:24.884
<i>see if the solutions to our problem
lies outside the box.</i>

479
00:47:26.802 --> 00:47:27.845
Call a meeting.

480
00:47:29.889 --> 00:47:31.682
- With who?
- Everyone!

481
00:47:33.893 --> 00:47:36.896
- You didn't return my calls.
- I don't return a lot of calls.

482
00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:39.231
I wanna discuss <i>Death Match.</i>
I think that we should pull the plug.

483
00:47:39.565 --> 00:47:42.443
When a real-life riot doesn't generate
a second-hour boost,

484
00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:46.614
- I'd say it's time to cut your loss.
- Exactly. We need to evolve.

485
00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:49.617
We've developed a strong base,
we have legitimate TV stars...

486
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.328
The board's decision is final, Miss Jones.

487
00:47:55.956 --> 00:47:58.959
In the past six months, I'm the only
profitable thing about this company.

488
00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.963
Unless you want a sexual harassment suit
crammed down your throat,

489
00:48:03.047 --> 00:48:05.049
you will listen to what I have to say.

490
00:48:16.018 --> 00:48:17.061
Fine.

491
00:48:18.521 --> 00:48:20.147
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

492
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.759
I'm troubled.

493
00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:54.557
What seemed to be a very simple task
has taken the most perplexing of turns.

494
00:48:57.184 --> 00:48:58.436
So I'm gonna speak slowly,

495
00:48:59.395 --> 00:49:00.521
clearly,

496
00:49:01.856 --> 00:49:05.025
so my message is not lost, or ignored,
or misinterpreted.

497
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:10.948
One million dollars to the man
who kills Carl Lucas.

498
00:49:13.159 --> 00:49:15.995
This offer expires in 48 hours,
and if that happens,

499
00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:19.582
I will consider you all enemies,

500
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:23.043
and I will bring war on your fucking head.

501
00:49:24.837 --> 00:49:26.172
Understand?

502
00:49:31.719 --> 00:49:33.220
Ninety percent of Terminal Island,

503
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:36.265
your grand investment, is dead space.

504
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.851
<i>Death Match</i> merely stayed your execution.

505
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:42.021
If you wanna get a breath of fresh air,
you need a bold initiative.

506
00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:43.856
I propose a race.

507
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:45.983
Wicked. Epic.

508
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:49.236
Something like no one has ever seen before.

509
00:49:52.281 --> 00:49:54.366
The track will run the length
of Terminal Island

510
00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:56.744
along some of the narrowest
and most harrowing paths

511
00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:58.078
that the racing world has to offer.

512
00:49:58.746 --> 00:50:02.583
The best part of it, everything that we need
is right in our own backyard.

513
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:04.919
We're gonna modify each vehicle,

514
00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:08.214
adding reinforced steel plating,
bulletproof glass, and roll cages

515
00:50:08.297 --> 00:50:10.549
to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.

516
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:12.551
We'll take everything
that made <i>Death Match</i> a hit,

517
00:50:13.135 --> 00:50:15.221
combine it with everything
we have at our disposal.

518
00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:17.097
Such as?

519
00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:18.516
Heavy fucking artillery.

520
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:26.398
<i>Every car will hold as many
guns and as much ammunition as it can.</i>

521
00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:31.195
So, you're going to arm the prisoners.

522
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:35.157
Precautions will be made to make sure
they can only shoot at people on the track.

523
00:50:37.076 --> 00:50:40.746
Nine cars, three days,
20,000 rounds of ammunition.

524
00:50:45.084 --> 00:50:47.419
Going from fighting to racing,
that's a big leap.

525
00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:52.716
We need a hook.
Something that incorporates the two better.

526
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.639
Now, in a game show, no one cares
about the game. The game's arbitrary.

527
00:50:59.098 --> 00:51:01.892
People care about the risk and the money.

528
00:51:02.226 --> 00:51:06.272
Now, we've been concentrating on the game,
not the risk.

529
00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:08.274
That's why our audience is bored.

530
00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:10.526
Let's concentrate on the prize.

531
00:51:10.859 --> 00:51:13.821
A prize more valuable than money.

532
00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:17.449
Okay. What's more valuable than money?

533
00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:21.078
Life

534
00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:24.123
is a more valuable prize than money.

535
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:27.293
In our deal with the state,
we control sentencing.

536
00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:29.545
That means we control their life.

537
00:51:29.628 --> 00:51:32.798
So if a prisoner wins five races,
he gets his freedom.

538
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:37.052
No matter what he's in for,
robbery, rape, homicide, whatever,

539
00:51:38.137 --> 00:51:39.763
he wins his freedom.

540
00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:41.974
He wins his life.

541
00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:44.101
You have life,

542
00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:47.146
freedom.

543
00:51:50.399 --> 00:51:51.442
Stop.

544
00:51:56.447 --> 00:51:57.823
<i>Death Race.</i>

545
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:07.916
You know what?
That's fucking bullshit, Rocco.

546
00:52:08.334 --> 00:52:10.002
Well, how do you know, man?
Maybe it's for real.

547
00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:11.086
Are you kidding me?

548
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:14.340
You think they're gonna let murderers
and rapists out of this place, ever?

549
00:52:14.423 --> 00:52:16.091
Hey, Luke's right.

550
00:52:16.175 --> 00:52:19.094
And besides that, homes,
you don't drive worth a shit.

551
00:52:19.178 --> 00:52:21.347
You know what? Fucking blow me.

552
00:52:25.184 --> 00:52:26.518
Fucking faggot.

553
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.190
That would be the only chance I have
of getting out.

554
00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.985
And what would you do, Lists,
if you got out?

555
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:40.199
Start over.

556
00:52:47.539 --> 00:52:49.792
<i>Welcome to</i> Death Race.

557

<i>Dim the lights.

Welcome to day one of <i>Death Race.</i>

564
00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:32.543
Before you, 18 cons vie for their freedom.

565
00:53:33.419 --> 00:53:37.089
They must survive all three laps
in order to proceed to day two.

566
00:53:37.756 --> 00:53:39.091
Their first challenge?

567
00:53:39.717 --> 00:53:41.719
There are only nine cars.

568
00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:45.097
That's right, gentlemen. Nine cars!

569
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:49.435
Three, two, one,

570
00:53:50.769 --> 00:53:51.770
go!

571
00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.634
This is what I'm talking about!

572

Mine!

573
00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.145
This just keeps getting better and better!

574
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:36.148
- Hey, baby.
- How about a bit <i>v rodet?</i>

575
00:54:55.584 --> 00:54:57.002
Oh, baby, yeah!

576
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.470
Don't think so!

577
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.517
Why did you let that con beat you?

578
00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:15.604
- Shit!
- Hang on!

579
00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:24.446
- Fuck!
- Hey, why do I need this?

580
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.865
- You mind helping me out with this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Who am I talking to?

581
00:55:27.032 --> 00:55:29.034
- To talk to your pit team.
- Pit team?

582
00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.994
Luke! Good to have you, man.

583
00:55:31.537 --> 00:55:35.207
So, you got your guns, your oil, your smoke,
and your napalm here.

584
00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:38.710
- Get your eyes on the road.
- Let's race.

585
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.394
<i>Luke! Goldberg.</i>

586
00:55:55.727 --> 00:55:59.231
Yeah. The Mexican Jew's here
to save your bony white ass.

587
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:02.192
Now, swords and shields don't play
until the second lap.

588
00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:06.321
<i>You've got the fastest car out there,
except the Porsche.</i>

589
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:09.241
And don't go head-to-head with that Ram,
or he'll have you for lunch.

590
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:11.702
Son of a bitch!

591
00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:19.167
Looks like we're already on the menu.

592
00:56:22.671 --> 00:56:23.714
Eat this.

593
00:56:26.091 --> 00:56:27.092

594
00:56:30.262 --> 00:56:32.931
- Now I got you, baby!
- Is that all you got, pretty boy?

595
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.266
Careful of the one on the right!

596
00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.101
Good to know.

597
00:56:45.277 --> 00:56:47.446
- Yeah! That's my man!
- Yes!

598
00:56:53.118 --> 00:56:55.287

- To the left.

00:57:18.977 --> 00:57:19.978
Motherfucker!

604
00:57:28.654 --> 00:57:32.324
That was a great lap, Luke, but now
you need to get to a sword plate, and fast.

605
00:57:32.658 --> 00:57:33.742
Activate swords, shields and death heads.

606
00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:35.327
<i>Sword pressure plates activated.</i>

607
00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:36.995
<i>Shield pressure plates activated.</i>

608
00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:41.249
You gotta find a sword, Luke.
You gotta find a sword plate.

609
00:57:41.833 --> 00:57:44.002
<i>That's right. Get back to work.</i>

610
00:57:44.503 --> 00:57:45.587
There's one!

611
00:57:46.088 --> 00:57:47.506
- I see it.
- Go for it. Go for it!

Yeah!
How do you like that one, boy?

614
00:57:58.016 --> 00:57:59.017
What the hell is he doing?

615
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:00.852
<i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

616
00:58:02.187 --> 00:58:03.313
- Oh, jeez!
- Guns! Guns!

617
00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:07.317
Eat my lead, boy! Eat my lead!

618
00:58:11.697 --> 00:58:12.864
Get down! Now!

619
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.616

621
00:58:19.037 --> 00:58:20.205
You gotta turn here!

622
00:58:23.375 --> 00:58:24.501
I'm working on it.

623
00:58:28.839 --> 00:58:30.007
Hang on.

624
00:58:36.722 --> 00:58:39.057
God! Oh, God, no!

625
00:58:43.478 --> 00:58:44.730
Yeah!

626
00:58:45.564 --> 00:58:47.774
<i>- Ooh, yeah!</i>
<i>- That was close.</i>

627
00:58:49.234 --> 00:58:51.486
Stock car racing
got its start during Prohibition

628
00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:54.322
with moonshine runners
fleeing federal agents.

629
00:58:54.823 --> 00:59:00.078
Bill France Sr. conceived NASCAR in 1947
during a meeting in Daytona, Florida.

630
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:04.041
"Lists." I get it now.

- Get a close-up on that.
- Camera two, move to your left.

Where did he go?

636
01:00:13.151 --> 01:00:14.444
You ain't escaping me now.

637
01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:18.824
A million dollars. It's gonna be mine.

638
01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.283

639
01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:21.993

<i>A million dollars.
It's gonna be mine.</i>

641
01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.499
I'll take care of it.

642
01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:41.680
Take the wheel.

643
01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.444
Take that, bitch.
Think you're special?

644
01:00:58.613 --> 01:00:59.656

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.218
Hey, where'd you learn that?

689
01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:09.721
- I was a Girl Scout.
- Really?

690
01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:13.892
- I'm gonna get you, fucker!
- Is that right?

691
01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.643
You don't mess with somebody
in this motherfucking race!

692
01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:16.811
- Is that a fucking date?
- Yeah!

693
01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:19.230
- Yeah? Come on! Fucking pretty boy!
- Gonna fucking blow up your ass!

694
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:20.899
Come on, suck my dick, bitch!

695
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.902
Hey, Lists, go kick his ass. Come on.

696
01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.996
Tomorrow, you die.

697
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:46.091
Katrina! Let's go.

698
01:04:51.596 --> 01:04:56.059
- Hey, so I get to see you tomorrow, or what?
- If you're lucky.

699
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:08.780
Damn.

700
01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.700
Hey, come on, snap out of it, guys.

701
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.412
Hey, Lists, you gotta fix it up there
under here.

702
01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.914
Right here. Right in here.

703
01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.551
Come on, Lucas, let's go.

704
01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.929
- You heard him. Move.
- Hey, what did I do?

705
01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:37.934
Go to sleep!

706
01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.319
Hey, this is bullshit!

707
01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.411
Okay, what did I do?

708
01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:57.912
You won!

709
01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.666
To the victor belongs the spoils.

710
01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:03.835
Okay, so what does that mean?

711
01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.173
What is this?

712
01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:13.803
In ancient Rome, the winning gladiator
was the recipient of gifts.

713
01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.807
A show of gratitude from the powers that be

714
01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.477
for a job well done.

715
01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.353
She's yours.

716
01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.026
Mmm-hmm.

717
01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.487
Do with her what you please.

718
01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:32.530
Is that right?

719
01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:34.199
And who the fuck are you?

720
01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:37.869
I'm Caesar.

721
01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:54.385
You know, they're probably watching.

722
01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:56.387
Mmm-hmm.

723
01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.556
Listening, too, I guess.

724
01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:01.017
Some kind of game they're playing.

725
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.479
Yeah, probably betting
on what we'll do next.

726
01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:07.232
Option A, they're trying to get us closer

727
01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:10.902
so they can use one of us against the other.

728
01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.237
Uh-huh.

729
01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:16.699
Option B being, maybe, put a wedge
between us, so we fuck up on the track?

730
01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:19.911
I guess we do what they want,

731
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.581
and leave the bullshit for later.

732
01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:28.503
You playing me?

733
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:32.840
Does it matter?

734
01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.095
No.

735
01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.498
Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas,

736
01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.959
and all the bangers are going for it.

737
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:57.592
Put Mr. Lucas in solitary.

738
01:08:57.675 --> 01:09:01.429
I thought this was a prison thing, but this is
too big for even the guards to resist.

739
01:09:01.512 --> 01:09:03.973
- You still gonna let him race?
- Oh, yeah.

740
01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.185
They're free to kill him on the track,
just not off camera.

741
01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.353
What about him?

742
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.033
Wait! Wait!

743
01:09:35.713 --> 01:09:36.798
Come on. Let's go.

744
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:39.217
You had your fun. Move.

745
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:42.553
- Where are we going?
- Shut up.

746
01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.975
What the fuck is this?

747
01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:59.987
Beautiful view of freedom from here, Katrina.

748
01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:01.864
Okay.

749
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.533
But who are you?

750
01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.914
You're much more attractive in person.

751
01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.668
I'm flattered. What do you want?

752
01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:18.089
Carl Lucas. I want him dead.

753
01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:22.093
And in return, I offer you freedom.

754
01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:26.764
A chance of life outside these walls

755
01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.851
for one simple task.

756
01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:34.731
You've got 48 hours.
You kill him or I kill you.

757
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.906
Let me make these walls disappear.

758
01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:48.453
Let me make you part of the view
from outside, Katrina.

759
01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:49.620
Freedom.

760
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:56.127
Forty-eight hours.

761
01:10:58.463 --> 01:10:59.630
Tick-tock.

762
01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:22.987
- Yeah?
<i>- Sixty-five share.</i>

763
01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:24.822
<i>Well done, young lady.</i>

764
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.624
It's truly for the best.

765
01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.836
You weren't happy, the board wasn't happy.

766
01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.340
We need someone for this institution
that shares the common vision.

767
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.300
Just wasn't you.

768
01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:49.347
Warden Parks,
we're here to escort you from the premises.

769
01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.853
"Whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein."

770
01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:58.981
Proverb 26:27.

771
01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:01.734
Is that supposed to be deep?

772
01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.153
Hopefully deep enough that, when you fall,

773
01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:06.239
you'll break your fucking neck.

774
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.886
- What do you want?
- Time to race.

775
01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:03.421
<i>You got a big fucking bulls-eye
on your back, Luke.</i>

776
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:05.882
<i>You feel all those eyes on you?</i>

777
01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:09.093
<i>Ain't 'cause you're pretty,
or because you're in first place.</i>

778
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.722
<i>Markus Kane put a million dollars
on your head.</i>

779
01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:16.267
It's a monster fucking bounty, Lucas.

780
01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:17.935
It's as plain as day.

781
01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:19.770
I don't believe it.

782
01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:21.606
Why would I lie?

783
01:13:22.273 --> 01:13:23.983
It makes no fucking sense.

784
01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.778
What're you gonna do?

785
01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:51.177
Two, one, and we're in.

786
01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.971
<i>Welcome to</i> Death Race.

787
01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:58.434
<i>Eighteen men started. Only six remain.</i>

788
01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:02.813
<i>An estimated 50 million people
watched Carl Lucas win day one.</i>

789
01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:04.649
<i>Can he do it again?</i>

790
01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:08.319
<i>Five other racers will have something to say
about that.</i>

791
01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.822
<i>Welcome to day two of</i> Death Race.

792
01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.994
<i>Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.</i>

793
01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:26.504
<i>Hey! Aren't you two just
bubbling over with sunshine this morning?</i>

794
01:14:27.004 --> 01:14:29.173
<i>Come on. We got a race to win.</i>

795
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.513
What is it?

796
01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.016
Nothing.

797
01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:41.686
Let's race.

798
01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:58.035
I've got you now, motherfucker!

799
01:14:58.202 --> 01:14:59.203
Coming up behind you!

800
01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:01.205
Watch out!

801
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:05.501
Yeah! I just fucked your ass!

802
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.046
Activate swords and shields.

803
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:15.886
<i>- Sword plate activated.</i>
- Damn!

804
01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:18.764
- Watch your back!
- Careful.

805
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.391
Here comes the guns.

806
01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:24.979
You gotta find a shield, man.

807
01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.105
<i>You gotta find a shield!</i>

808
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.356
- There's one!
- I see it.

809
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.733
Go for it. Go for it!

810
01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.029
<i>Shield pressure plate activated.</i>

811
01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.575
- Throw the smoke!
- No, not yet.

812
01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.494
Luke, what're you waiting for?

813
01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:41.620
Okay, ready?

814
01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:42.747
Pull it now!

815
01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:45.249
Smoke, now.

816
01:16:08.898 --> 01:16:09.940
Let's get this car back in the race.

817
01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.115
Fuck!

818
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.287
Yeah! Great shit!

819
01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:33.839
Okay, baby, now we come.

820
01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:35.633
<i>Sword plate activated.</i>

821
01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:37.510
Go, go! Get gun! Get gun!

822
01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.597
- Watch your back!
- Get your ass out of there, Luke.

823
01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:44.934
Bounty is mine, motherfucker!

824
01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:48.145
I'm tired of this asshole.

825
01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:49.688
Time to lose.

826
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.483
Oh, my God.

827
01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:53.859
Hang on.

828
01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.192
Dig that!

829
01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:56.463
Still taking it, huh?

830
01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.424
- You die!
- Come on!

831
01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.426
Today! Today you die!

832
01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.720
What do you got, huh?

833
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.027
Beautiful.

834
01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:43.010
All right, it's clear sailing
to the finish line now.

835
01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.431
What are you doing?

836
01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:54.438
- The enemy of my enemy.
- What's happening?

837
01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:56.690
You die.

838
01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.797
You wanna tell me why
you just risked our lives to save that banger?

839
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.716
They're Triads. The only people
Markus would not deal with.

840
01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:25.803
That's why they're not after us.
They have no clue about the hit.

841
01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:32.142
Look, it's a Triad kill thing.
It's a life for a life.

842
01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.812
I save his, he owes me a favour.

843
01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:58.377
- Well, I saved your life.
- Really? How so?

844
01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:02.840
Because your Markus Kane offered
to buy my freedom if I would kill you.

845
01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.342
Jesus! They all want me dead, now you, too?

846
01:20:08.846 --> 01:20:12.016
- I guess you owe me a favour, too.
- I can't wait.

847
01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:16.603
- Hey! I want a favour, too, huh?
- Fuck off, Goldberg.

848
01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:22.776
Yeah, I got you, baby.

849
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.862
<i>Sword pressure plates activated.</i>

850
01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:27.448
Shield ahead.

<i>Shield pressure plate activated.</i>

852
01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:31.535
Okay, ready?

853
01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:33.203
Activate the napalm on my signal.

854
01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:37.458
Now.

855
01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.755
- What's this?
- It's not working!

856
01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:44.798
What's wrong?

857
01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:46.967
- This is not good, Luke.
- It's a setup.

858
01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.388
Yeah. I'm coming, baby!

859
01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:57.102
Hey, Goldberg.
Someone had a play date with this car.

860
01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:00.105
I got nothing. No guns, no smoke, nothing.

861
01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:01.899
Come on, hit it, you dumbass bitch!

862
01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.609
<i>Swerve! Swerve!</i>

863
01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:05.569
- You, motherfucker!
- Turn!

864
01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:06.904
What can I do?

865
01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:09.239
- Brace yourself.
- No! What are you doing?

866
01:21:09.782 --> 01:21:11.283
<i>Get the fuck out of there!</i>

867
01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:14.244
Come on! You need to get out of there!

868
01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:17.456
This is my fight.

869
01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.000
No choice. Hang on.

870
01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:29.593
Here I come!

871
01:21:31.428 --> 01:21:33.180
Motherfucker won't stop firing!

872
01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.976
<i>Heat-seeking missile has been activated.</i>

873
01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:48.028
- Come on!
- Hey! Get out of there!

874
01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.330
Come on.

875
01:22:18.058 --> 01:22:19.643
- Yeah! Shit!
- Yeah!

876
01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:28.986
You just killed your own pit crew.

877
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.530
Bitch, you shut the fuck up.

878
01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.386
- Goldberg.
- Hey, get out of there!

879
01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:01.268
Get in that car! I want a close-up.

880
01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:03.145
Get me out of here!

881
01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:04.980
Oh, God!

882
01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:20.746
No!

883
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.459
Oh, my God, no!

884
01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.927
Somebody help!

885
01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.726
Goldberg, get him out! Get him out!

886
01:23:58.325 --> 01:23:59.535
No.

887
01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:32.985
Rest in peace, Luke.

888
01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:39.366
Rocco!

889
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:44.204
- You gotta answer for Luke.
- What the fuck you talking about?

890
01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.332
Katrina said it was rigged from the inside.

891
01:24:47.416 --> 01:24:49.960
And you're the only motherfucker
that could have got to it.

892
01:24:50.043 --> 01:24:51.545
You killed him?

893
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:56.091
Get away from me. Fuck you both.

894
01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.474
- I need to talk to him.
- No.

895
01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:05.892
He saved your life!

896
01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.190
You owe him.

897
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:14.818
A life for a life.

898
01:25:16.486 --> 01:25:17.863
I know what to do.

899
01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:31.209
<i>We've induced coma.
Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised,</i>

900
01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:35.422
<i>but he should be moved to a facility
more suited to his needs.</i>

901
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.633
<i>Out of the question.</i>

902
01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:41.470
<i>Doctor, someone from the outside
tried to kill him.</i>

903
01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:45.515
<i>Unless they think he's dead,
they'll come back to finish the job.</i>

904
01:25:46.391 --> 01:25:49.394
Yeah, well, I can't pronounce a man dead
while he's still alive.

905
01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:51.605
Can't you?

906
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:03.867
How are we doing
with finding a replacement for Parks?

907
01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:05.869
She comes highly recommended
from Halliburton.

908
01:26:06.370 --> 01:26:08.872
She ran their maximum security
detention centre.

909
01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:11.708
She's strong. She's smart.
Ruthlessly ambitious.

910
01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:14.628
I think if I weren't around, she'd tell people
that <i>Death Race</i> was her idea

911
01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.546
and she'd convince them that it was.

912
01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.548
How's the switchover to the Internet?

913
01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:19.883
Transition's complete.

914
01:26:20.467 --> 01:26:22.511
We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow.

915
01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:25.305
The numbers have
already surpassed pay-per-view,

916
01:26:25.389 --> 01:26:26.807
thanks to the Frankenstein commercial.

917
01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.058
Hold on. Wait.

918
01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:31.561
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this Frankenstein.

919
01:26:37.484 --> 01:26:39.236
Did you make him up?

920
01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:42.906
Frankenstein most certainly exists,

921
01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.908
and he will be in the race tomorrow.

922
01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:47.911
He better be.

923
01:26:49.246 --> 01:26:53.083
And he better come as good as advertised.

924
01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:06.596
<i>The procedure's experimental and dangerous.</i>

925
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:09.099
<i>We're talking about placing
electrodes into the brain.</i>

926
01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:10.767
<i>You told me he was a perfect candidate.</i>

927
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:11.935
<i>Oh, he is.</i>

928
01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:13.562
<i>But there are no guarantees.</i>

929
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:15.939
<i>Let's wake him up.</i>

930
01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:30.287
<i>Mr. Lucas.</i>

931
01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:35.125
<i>You've got second-degree burns
over 85% of your body.</i>

932
01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.422
<i>Now, you're lucky that you suffered
no significant injuries.</i>

933
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:42.924
<i>Not a broken bone or damaged organ,</i>

934
01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:47.637
<i>which is remarkable
considering the intensity of the fire.</i>

935
01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.729
<i>So, this is hell?</i>

936
01:27:58.648 --> 01:27:59.775
<i>Why?</i>

937
01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.987
<i>Where else would you be?</i>

938
01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.865
<i>You do remember me.</i>

939
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.702
<i>You win five races and you're free.</i>

940
01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.830
<i>You're out of your fucking mind.</i>

941
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.334
<i>No more Markus Kane
trying to track you down.</i>

942
01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:19.669
Like a second chance.

943
01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:22.839
Look at me.

944
01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:25.175
Really. Look at me.

945
01:28:31.681 --> 01:28:33.975
<i>What kind of second chance would I have?</i>

946
01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:38.230
<i>You're either
Frankenstein or you're nobody.</i>

947
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.233
You're certainly not Carl Lucas any more.

948
01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.236
<i>The entire world watched him incinerate.</i>

949
01:28:45.362 --> 01:28:47.322
<i>There's even a death certificate.</i>

950
01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:49.533
<i>I pity you.</i>

951
01:28:50.075 --> 01:28:52.536
<i>Okay.
If you don't do it for your life,</i>

952
01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.038
<i>then you do it for Katrina.</i>

953
01:28:56.039 --> 01:29:00.168
<i>I'll furlough five of my worst sodomites
for a play date with sweet Katrina.</i>

954
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:04.756
<i>By the time they're finished with her,
she'll be lucky if she has a pulse.</i>

955
01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.149
How do you feel, Mr. Lucas?

956
01:30:07.277 --> 01:30:08.278
The name

957
01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:10.947
is Frankenstein.

958
01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:53.323
Sorry to disappoint you.

959
01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:56.159
You're gonna have to settle
for the Mexican Jew.

960
01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:01.206
Three, two, one, and we're in.

961
01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:05.335
Good evening, and welcome to <i>Death Race.</i>

962
01:31:05.752 --> 01:31:09.923
We're streaming live worldwide
for over 20 million viewers. This week...

963
01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:11.049
Yada, yada, yada.

964
01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.051
Cut in promos of the drivers
as soon as the light hits green,

965
01:31:13.176 --> 01:31:15.929
cut back to me, crane up,
chase out after Frankenstein. Got it?

966
01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:17.180
<i>Yeah. It'll look good.</i>

967
01:31:17.263 --> 01:31:18.765
Yeah, I know it's a great shot.

968
01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.684
<i>It will be. We're live in five.</i>

969
01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:22.185
Okay, time for one more.

970
01:31:22.686 --> 01:31:23.687
Go.

971
01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:24.938
Go!

972
01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:30.443
Where's Lists?

973
01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:33.071
Said he had some business to take care of.

974
01:32:14.487 --> 01:32:15.905
Climb aboard.

975
01:32:46.603 --> 01:32:47.729
What?

976
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:50.023
You expecting another pretty boy?

977
01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:28.645
<i>Good evening,

978

979

<i>This week, 14K attempts
to repeat as champion.</i>

980
01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:38.279
<i>But he'll have fierce competition
from several new drivers,</i>

981
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.199
<i>including Frankenstein.</i>

982
01:34:33.459 --> 01:34:34.502
What are you doing?

983
01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.809
Tell me who sent you.

984
01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:03.031
Good for you, Luke.

985
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:12.373
Payback for Lucas.

986
01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.886
Oh, my God!

987
01:35:58.628 --> 01:36:00.797
Yes! The drinks are on me!

988
01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:02.465
Yes!

989
01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:07.470
Move my tee-off time
from 9:00 to 10:00.

990
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:10.139
You see that?

991
01:36:11.641 --> 01:36:13.142
That's a stupid bitch.

992
01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.984
Take care of your business?

993
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.666
I'm only sorry Luke didn't live to see this.

994
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.502
I'm not so sure he didn't.

995
01:36:45.174 --> 01:36:46.634
Frankenstein, huh?

996
01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:48.970
You got a real name?

997
01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:55.184
Uh-huh.

998
01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:57.270
Yeah, of course, I do.
