you didn't appear to be a politician.

340
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:40,457
It's certainly not something I wanted to do 
when I was younger.

341
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,159
I thought most student politicians 
were complete nerds.

342
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:46,499
Well, I'm with you there. 
So, what turned you on to politics?

343
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,629
(CHUCKLES)

344
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,802
Turned me on, indeed.

345
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:57,141
Let's see, I was 23, something like that, 
a couple of years out of Cambridge.

346
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,811
And I remember it was a Sunday afternoon, 
it was raining.

347
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:05,583
I was still in bed. 
And someone starts knocking at the door.

348
00:26:06,846 --> 00:26:09,520
And, you know, 
I'd been out the night before

349
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:12,119
and had a few drinks and what have you.

350
00:26:12,184 --> 00:26:14,994
So, I get the pillow and I put It 
over my head, and it starts up again.

351
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:16,590
Knock, knock, knock, knock!

352
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:20,627
And I get up, I'm swearing, 
I go to the door and there's this girl.

353
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:24,607
She's soaking wet, but she just launches 
into this speech about the local elections.

354
00:26:24,664 --> 00:26:26,200
And that's it.

355
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:30,209
-I'm in love. 
-And this is Ruth?

356
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,608
This is Ruth.

357
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:37,253
And the only way I can see her again 
is to join the party and hand out leaflets.

358
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:38,788
This is great.

359
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:40,849

Cambridge?

390
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,346
It was such a long time ago, 
I can hardly remember.

391
00:29:57,409 --> 00:29:58,979
You did a lot of acting?

392
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:00,749
Some.

393
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:04,423
It must have been good training 
for politics, acting?

394
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,861
It was a good way to meet girls.

395
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:09,422
Let's not put that in, by the way, okay?

396
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:12,196
Still, acting must have been 
very important to you.

397
00:30:12,257 --> 00:30:13,634
Okay, let's say I enjoyed it.

398
00:30:13,692 --> 00:30:15,694
You know, you go on the stage, 
pretend to be somebody else,

399
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:18,435
and people actually applaud you for it.

400
00:30:18,497 --> 00:30:19,976
Good, that's more like it. Let's put that in.

-No. 
-Why not?

402
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,010
Because these are the memoirs 
of a Prime Minister.

And whenever my opponents were stuck 
with something to hit me with,

404
00:30:25,371 --> 00:30:27,442
they always said I was a bloody actor!

405
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:30,851
Do you know what the Times of London 
said the day I resigned?

01:01:39,243 --> 01:01:41,746
-Adam, good to see you. 
-ADAM: Thank you.

839
01:01:41,812 --> 01:01:44,053
Thank you very much, indeed. 
It's good to see you.

840
01:01:44,114 --> 01:01:45,491
Don't grin.

841
01:01:46,317 --> 01:01:47,728
MALE NEWS READER: 
In Iraq, a suicide bomber...

842
01:01:47,785 --> 01:01:49,025
For God's sake!

843
01:01:49,086 --> 01:01:50,326

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

846
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:03,303
Adam.

847
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:07,978
Calling to find out how I think it went.

848
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,713
-Let him sweat. 
-Does he always ask for your advice?

849
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:13,254
Yes,

850
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:16,454
and always usually takes it.

851
01:02:17,514 --> 01:02:19,016
Until lately.

852
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:23,527
-Are you married? 
-Certainly not.

853
01:02:23,587 --> 01:02:25,624
-Gay? 
-No.

854
01:02:26,457 --> 01:02:29,233
-Did you have a... 
-l had a... Um...

855
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:32,433
-What? Girlfriend? 
-Well, a bit more than that.

856
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:33,839
Partner?

857
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,008
A bit less than that.

858
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:37,909
I don't know, 
40,000 years of human language

859
01:02:37,968 --> 01:02:40,141
and there's no word 
to describe our relationship.

860
01:02:40,204 --> 01:02:41,410
It was doomed.

861
01:02:41,471 --> 01:02:42,472
(CHUCKLES)

862
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,245
Come on. Let's eat.

863
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,357
-How's it going? 
-The book?

864
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,789
-Well, it's not, to be honest. 
-Sit there.

865
01:02:58,121 --> 01:03:00,795
-Can I ask you something? 
-Of course.

866
01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:05,398
I find it difficult 
to understand certain things.

867
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:07,965
-What things? 
-Well...

868
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:12,675
I can't understand 
why this good-looking lad

869
01:03:12,736 --> 01:03:16,741
who goes to Cambridge 
without the slightest interest in politics

870
01:03:17,174 --> 01:03:20,587
and who spends his time acting 
and chasing girls,

871
01:03:21,345 --> 01:03:23,154
-suddenly ends up... 
-Married to me?

872
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:26,126
Oh, no, not that. No, not that, at all.

873
01:03:27,684 --> 01:03:29,891
No, what I don't get

874
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:33,332
is why, at 22, 
he's suddenly a political activist.

875
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,132
-l mean, where does that come from? 
-Didn't you ask him?

876
01:03:36,193 --> 01:03:38,867
He said he joined the party because of you.

877
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:41,739
Told me a great story about you 
turning up at his place in the rain.

878
01:03:41,799 --> 01:03:44,643
-l was gonna start the whole book with it. 
-And now you're not?

879
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:47,739
No, I can't. it's not true.

880
01:03:49,006 --> 01:03:51,612
-Isn't it? 
-Well, you know it's not.

881
01:03:52,076 --> 01:03:54,113
He'd been a member for two years 
before he met you.

882
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:56,021
How do you know that?

883
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:59,816
I've got a copy 
of his original party membership card.

884
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:03,889
Mike McAra found it in the archives.

885
01:04:03,954 --> 01:04:07,731
Typical Mike, to ruin a good story 
with too much research.

886
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,793
Did he find anything else?

887
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:12,306
Not much. Cambridge stuff mainly.

888
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,768
You were more political than he was.

889
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:21,304
I was certainly a change 
from his Cambridge girlfriends.

890
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:24,011
All those Jocastas and Pandoras.

891
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:27,021
And so his marriage to you 
must have been pretty vital,

892
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:29,648
your knowledge 
and your contacts in the party.

893
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:32,523
And I thought he married me for my body.

894
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:39,366
Did you ever want to be 
a proper politician in your own right?

895
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,632
Of course. 
Didn't you want to be a proper writer?

896
01:04:44,127 --> 01:04:45,128
Ouch.

897
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:50,544
I'm sorry. I've hurt your feelings.

898
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:54,612
I suppose even ghosts must have feelings.

899
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:57,211
We are sensitive spirits.

900
01:04:59,343 --> 01:05:02,085
Talking of spirits, could you...

901
01:05:02,946 --> 01:05:04,425
Let me get you a proper drink.

902
01:05:13,557 --> 01:05:16,561
White wine, 
never really seen the point of it.

903
01:05:17,194 --> 01:05:19,470
That's the sort of thing Mike used to say.

904
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:22,135
Ah! At last, something in common.

905
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:28,249
Do you know the coroner reckoned 
he'd drunk nearly half a bottle?

906
01:05:28,305 --> 01:05:29,978
That's convenient.

907
01:05:30,774 --> 01:05:33,254
-What do you mean? 
-Nothing.

908
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:41,055
-You think his death was suspicious? 
-Don't you?

909
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:42,256
Yes.

910
01:05:44,388 --> 01:05:45,765
Yes, I do.

911
01:05:50,394 --> 01:05:52,101
Today at the beach,

912
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:56,033
I met a man, an old timer 
who was familiar with the currents.

913
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:57,874
And he said that there was no way

914
01:05:57,934 --> 01:06:01,279
that a body from the ferry 
could have washed ashore on that spot.

915
01:06:01,338 --> 01:06:02,373
You're kidding.

916
01:06:02,439 --> 01:06:06,649
He also said that there was a woman who 
saw flashlights on the beach that night.

917
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:10,590
And then she fell down the stairs, 
and now she's in a coma. That's all I know.

918
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:13,594
That's all you know? Jesus.

919
01:06:19,189 --> 01:06:21,169
-Can I borrow your phone? 
-Why?

920
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,634
I need to call Adam.

921
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,071
-What? 
-Nothing.

922
01:06:32,135 --> 01:06:35,548
-Aren't you gonna call him? 
-Later. I'm going out for a walk.

923
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:38,211
But it's pitch black. it's pouring with rain.

924
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:40,312
-It'll clear my head. 
-Well, I'll come with you.

925
01:06:40,377 --> 01:06:44,120
No. Thanks, but I need to work this one 
through on my own.

926
01:06:44,181 --> 01:06:47,162
Stay here. Have another drink. 
Don't wait up.

927
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:04,905
(DOOR OPENING)

928
01:07:08,839 --> 01:07:10,341
Are you awake?

929
01:07:12,242 --> 01:07:14,381
-Well, I am now. 
-I'm sorry.

930
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:18,389
It's all right. Hang on.

931
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:25,860
-What time is it? 
-l don't know.

932
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:29,727
I called Adam.

933
01:07:31,728 --> 01:07:34,174
-And? 
-Can I come in?

934
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:50,719
The day before Mike died,

935
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:53,619
he and Adam had a terrible row.

936
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,788
I've never told anyone this before, 
not even the police.

937
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:57,889
-What about? 
-l don't know.

938
01:07:58,622 --> 01:08:02,297
But it was furious. They never spoke again.

939
01:08:02,526 --> 01:08:03,937
(DISTANT THUNDERING)

940
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:09,242
When I asked Adam about it, 
he refused to discuss it.

941
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:14,807
After what you just said, 
I felt I should ask him again.

942
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:17,181
And what did he say?

943
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:20,082
He was having dinner 
with the Vice President.

944
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:23,647
That bloody Bly woman 
wouldn't even give him the phone.

945
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:27,591
(SOBBING) 
Oh, God. Oh, dear God.

946
01:08:29,085 --> 01:08:31,326
What's he got himself mixed up in?

947
01:08:31,388 --> 01:08:35,268
It's all right. Everything'll be all right.

948
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:38,771
I'm scared.

949
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:43,603
I've never been scared in my life before, 
but I am now.

950
01:08:44,067 --> 01:08:45,171
(CRYING)

951
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:49,576
Your hair's all wet, you're drenched. 
Let me get you a towel.

952
01:09:06,223 --> 01:09:07,224
(SOFTLY) Bad idea.

953
01:09:09,192 --> 01:09:10,637
Do you mind?

954
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:12,872
Course not.

955
01:10:12,522 --> 01:10:15,059
The modesty of the morning after?

956
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,866
I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep.

957
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,099
You mean you thought I'd be gone?

958
01:10:34,444 --> 01:10:38,620
You've taken out the family tree. 
He's very proud of the Langs.

959
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:42,892
You know, if you want a family tree, 
goto a garden center.

960
01:10:44,888 --> 01:10:47,300
Why have you underlined my name 
every time?

961
01:10:47,357 --> 01:10:49,667
I was surprised 
there wasn't more about you.

962
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:52,263
Why? I'm just the wife.

963
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:55,473
Yeah, even so. 
You ought not to be written out of history.

964
01:10:55,532 --> 01:10:57,307
Why not? Most women are.

965
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:59,438
Then I'll reinstate you.

966
01:11:00,103 --> 01:11:01,844
I'll put in all the occasions 
that he's forgotten.

967
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:06,320
How kind. Like the boss's secretary 
that remembers his wife's birthday for him?

968
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:10,722
Something like that. But then, 
like you say, I'm not a proper writer.

969
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:13,351
-What are you planning to do? 
-Leave.

970
01:11:15,218 --> 01:11:17,198
It's not necessary, as far as I'm concerned.

971
01:11:17,254 --> 01:11:19,757
I'm afraid it is, as far as I am.

972
01:11:19,823 --> 01:11:22,531
-Where will you go? 
-Back to the hotel.

973
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:26,267
Look, I'm sorry. I should never have stayed 
in a client's house.

974
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:30,106
-It always ends up with... 
-With you screwing the client's wife?

975
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:32,147
No, not always.

976
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:34,943
But it does make it hard 
to maintain a professional distance.

977
01:11:35,005 --> 01:11:39,681
And the thing we discussed last night? 
What do you propose to do about that?

978
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:43,486
-That's none of my business. 
-Well, you can't just ignore it.

979
01:11:43,547 --> 01:11:47,723
Look, I'm his ghostwriter. 
I'm not an investigative reporter.

980
01:11:47,784 --> 01:11:51,459
-What are you gonna do about it? 
-Perhaps I'll write my own memoirs.

981
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:53,432
Ex-Prime Minister's Wife Tells All.

982
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:55,197
Well, if you ever decide to do that, 
give me a call.

983
01:11:55,258 --> 01:11:57,704
You think I need someone like you 
to produce my book?

984
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:00,674
I don't want to be in his bloody memoirs.

985
01:12:01,364 --> 01:12:04,038
He's on his own. I'll get a divorce.

986
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:06,938
And she can do the prison visits.

987
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:43,245
Morning, sir.

988
01:12:43,306 --> 01:12:46,412
-Finished for the night, have we? 
-Why don't you just piss off?

(AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE) 
BMW ConnectedDrive.

990
01:13:40,497 --> 01:13:42,568
Traffic is clear to your destination.

991
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:02,354
Join the road when possible.

992
01:14:20,670 --> 01:14:23,412
In 200 yards, turn left.

993
01:14:23,974 --> 01:14:26,477
Sorry, lady, but the hotel is right.

994
01:14:30,947 --> 01:14:32,688
Turn around when possible.

995
01:14:32,749 --> 01:14:34,888
This is getting ridiculous.

996
01:14:55,905 --> 01:14:57,646
Turn around when possible.

997
01:14:57,707 --> 01:14:59,482
All right, you win.

998
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:16,736
In 50 yards, turn left.

01:15:24,267 --> 01:15:25,769
Turn left.

01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:29,007
You've got to be joking.

1001
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:45,062
Single or return?

1002
01:15:45,121 --> 01:15:47,067
Return. I hope.

1003
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:50,032
Forty bucks, please.

1004
01:15:51,027 --> 01:15:52,768

-Ta.

Okay, come on. Come on, keep coming.

1006
01:16:19,689 --> 01:16:21,669

1023

-ls that Mrs. Emmett? 
-Who is this?

1024
01:19:51,968 --> 01:19:54,244
I wondered if I might have a word 
with Professor Emmett.

1025
01:19:54,304 --> 01:19:55,647
Do you have an appointment?

1026
01:19:55,705 --> 01:19:59,346
It's about Adam Lang. 
I'm assisting him with his memoirs.

1027
01:19:59,809 --> 01:20:01,755
Just a moment, please.

1028
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:08,360
PAUL: This is Paul Emmett. 
I think you must have made a mistake.

1029
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:10,694
But you were at Cambridge with Mr. Lang?

1030
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:14,895
We were contemporaries, yes, 
but I can't claim to know him.

1031
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:17,528
I have a photograph of you together.

1032
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,568
Come on up to the house.

1033
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:53,436
I make it a rule never to see anyone 
without an appointment.

1034
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,742
But your mention of a photograph 
rather tickled my curiosity.

1035
01:20:59,435 --> 01:21:03,178
-Please, come in. 
-Thank you.

1036
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:05,777
Yes, he's here now.

1037
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,083
-May I? 
-Sure.

1038
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:11,891
NANCY: Yes. Yes, he's on his own.

1039
01:21:12,748 --> 01:21:14,284
He didn't say.

1040
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:16,826
British, about 40.

1041
01:21:16,886 --> 01:21:20,800
Well, well. 
I literally have no recollection of this.

1042
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:22,828
-But that is you? 
-Yes, it is.

1043
01:21:22,892 --> 01:21:26,101
I was on the board of the Dramat. 
I had quite a time of it, as you can imagine.

1044
01:21:26,162 --> 01:21:30,304
-The Dramat? 
-I'm sorry. The Yale Dramatic Association.

1045
01:21:30,366 --> 01:21:32,346
I maintained my theatrical interests

1046
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:35,712
when I went to Cambridge 
for my doctoral research.

1047
01:21:38,341 --> 01:21:40,116
-Could I keep this? 
-No, I'm afraid not.

1048
01:21:40,176 --> 01:21:44,283
-I'm sure I could get you a copy. 
-Would you? That would be kind.

1049
01:21:45,881 --> 01:21:47,724
Maybe you could tell me 
how you came by it.

1050
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:49,456
I'd be happy to.

1051
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:54,097
Come into my study.

01:22:21,217 --> 01:22:23,219
I've been working with Adam Lang 
on his memoirs.

1059
01:22:23,286 --> 01:22:25,357
Yes, I know, you told me.

1060
01:22:25,922 --> 01:22:30,268
Yes, poor Lang. it's bad business, 
this posturing by The Hague.

1061
01:22:30,827 --> 01:22:34,172
As for Rycart, the worst 
British Foreign Secretary since the war.

1062
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,368
Lang was right to fire him.

1063
01:22:35,431 --> 01:22:38,310
-How well do you know Lang? 
-Hardly at all.

1064
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:42,813
-You seem surprised. 
-He mentions you in his memoirs.

1065
01:22:42,872 --> 01:22:44,146
Oh, really?

1066
01:22:45,174 --> 01:22:49,589
Well, now it's my turn to be surprised. 
What does he say?

That's very decent of him.

1070
01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:13,444
As Prime Minister, 
he always had good instincts.

1071

-But that doesn't mean I know him. 
-But the...

1072

That. That was taken at a reception 
in London

1073
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:21,815
to mark the 10-year anniversary 
of the Arcadia.

1074
01:23:21,878 --> 01:23:24,324
-Arcadia? 
-Yeah, it's a little organization that I ran.

1075
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:27,156
Very highbrow. 
No reason why you should have heard of it.

1076
01:23:27,216 --> 01:23:30,322
The Prime Minister graced us 
with his presence.

1077
01:23:30,486 --> 01:23:34,059
What can you remember of him 
from Cambridge?

1078
01:23:35,491 --> 01:23:38,335
-I'm sorry, you don't mind, do you? 
-No, not at all. Go ahead.

1079
01:23:38,394 --> 01:23:40,897
It's just that I'm rather bewildered.

1080
01:23:40,963 --> 01:23:44,342
No one's mentioned the Cambridge 
connection between us in all these years.

1081
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,041
-But you performed together? 
-In one production.

1082
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:52,414
It was the summer revue. 
I can't even remember what it was called.

1083
01:23:52,475 --> 01:23:56,048
-Can I show you something else? 
-If you must.

Let's hope he didn't inhale.

1089
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:13,437
But that is you standing behind him, 
isn't it?

1090
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:14,998
I do believe it is.

1091
01:24:15,064 --> 01:24:18,170
And I do believe I'm on the point 
of issuing a stern warning to him

1092
01:24:18,234 --> 01:24:20,475
on the perils of drug abuse.

1093
01:24:20,536 --> 01:24:25,485
Is Mr. Lang really going to use 
these pictures in his memoirs?

1094

If so, I would prefer it if I weren't named.

-No, I'm afraid not.

The whole summer is a blur, 
a very happy blur.

1099

Now, you were going to tell me 
about these pictures.

1100
01:24:46,362 --> 01:24:48,603
I got them from Michael McAra.

1101
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:52,071
And he is whom, exactly?

1102
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:54,614
My predecessor on Lang's memoirs.

-No, he died.

I'm sorry to hear that.

1105
01:25:00,343 --> 01:25:03,984
Yes, a couple of weeks ago. 
He drove up here to see you.

1106
01:25:04,313 --> 01:25:05,951
And he died a few hours afterwards.

1107
01:25:06,015 --> 01:25:09,485
He drove up to see me? 
No, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

1108

-How did he die? 
-He drowned.

Poor fellow.

1110

I've never really believed the myth that 
death by drowning is painless, have you?

1111
01:25:20,696 --> 01:25:23,199
Seems to me it must be agonizing.

1112
01:25:23,799 --> 01:25:25,745
And the police never said anything to you 
about this?

1113

No. Before we go any further, 
there's a few things I'd like to know first.

Such as, 
why did Mike McAra have your number?

1246
01:42:09,538 --> 01:42:10,915
Okay. Sure.

Mc Ara? How?

1249
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:18,849
Mike found the documents linking Lang 
to the torture flights.

who gave you the documents?

-Yeah, Mike McAra. The loyalest of the loyal. 
-But why?

He didn't like discovering 
he was working for a war criminal.

Oh, I forgot. You are.

1255
01:42:34,996 --> 01:42:36,236

01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,439
Well, don't tell me 
you're gonna read it now.

1257
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:09,907
Not all of it. Just the beginning.

Mike said he'd discovered something new. 
it's the last time he called me.

1263
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:32,553
He said it explained everything that had 
gone wrong when we were in government.

1264
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,328
-What was it? 
-He wouldn't say over the phone.

1265
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:40,237
He just kept saying if anything happened 
to him, the truth was in Lang's memoirs.

1266
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:42,268
"it's all there in the beginning."

1267
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:43,866
The beginning?

1268
01:43:44,966 --> 01:43:46,946
Then he means Cambridge.

1269

What the hell's this?

1270
01:44:00,181 --> 01:44:02,991
That is Lang, and that is Paul Emmett.

1271
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:06,355
Emmett? The Arcadia guy. So what?

1272
01:44:06,421 --> 01:44:10,096
On the day that Mike McAra died, 
he drove up to see Emmett,

1273
01:44:10,525 --> 01:44:12,436
and I think he was murdered 
on his way home.

1274
01:44:12,494 --> 01:44:13,871
-What? 
-l went to see Emmett today,

1275
01:44:13,928 --> 01:44:17,171
and two guys followed me from his house. 
That's why I called you.

At the time that this photograph was taken,

1277
01:44:21,436 --> 01:44:25,384
Paul Emmett was an officer in the CIA.

1278
01:44:25,873 --> 01:44:26,908
Emmett?

-Foreign Resources Division. 
-Oh, my God.

You realize how important this is, 
don't you?

1281
01:44:34,716 --> 01:44:37,595
This explains why Lang went into politics.

1282

Everyone knows he didn't have 
a political thought in his pretty little head.

1283
01:44:42,456 --> 01:44:47,166
This is why he rose so quickly, 
with a little help from his friends.

1284

You have no choice.

that I'd been to see him.

1316

Then you'll be subpoenaed 
and forced to repeat this whole story.

You're serious, aren't you?

1371
01:49:58,373 --> 01:50:02,082
When McAra found this, 
he went to Boston to show it to Emmett,

1372
01:50:02,143 --> 01:50:05,716
and he died on the way home, 
and I think he was murdered.

of those already.

you to go into politics in the first place.

-Emmett? I barely knew the man.

1379
01:50:22,997 --> 01:50:25,136

about Emmett being in the CIA...

He was too clever. Too loyal.

1383

Mike betrayed you to Rycart.

of the photograph, it's Rycart's.

-Mike, Mike. 
-And you knew he was disillusioned.

You had a big row with him 
just before he died.

-Paul Emmett? 
-What's he doing here?

1500
01:59:09,256 --> 01:59:11,964
Well, he was Ruth's tutor at Harvard 
when she was a Fulbright scholar.

1501
01:59:12,025 --> 01:59:13,629
Why shouldn't he be here?

1502
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:21,574
Do you mind if I have that back a second?

1503

if I could have your attention, please.

Thank you. 
I'd like to ask Ruth Lang to say a few words.

I miss Adam all the time.

1512
02:00:29,769 --> 02:00:31,544
But never more than tonight.

1513
02:00:32,005 --> 02:00:34,952
Not just 'cause we're meeting 
to launch his wonderful new book

1514
02:00:35,008 --> 02:00:38,615
and he should be here to share 
the joy of his life story with us,

1515
02:00:39,413 --> 02:00:43,384
but because he was so brilliant 
at making speeches

1516
02:00:44,317 --> 02:00:45,796
and I'm so terrible.

RUTH: Well, you'll be relieved to hear 
I'm not making a speech this evening.

1526
02:01:21,989 --> 02:01:24,128
I just want to thank 
our wonderful publishers,

1527

Marty Rhinehart and John Maddox,

1528
02:01:26,827 --> 02:01:30,036

02:01:31,098 --> 02:01:36,912
And finally, but especially, Mike McAra.

1530
02:01:37,104 --> 02:01:39,641
Mike, our thoughts are with you.

1531
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:45,253
In these very difficult few months, 
I've drawn great comfort from this book,

1532
02:01:45,312 --> 02:01:50,159
from knowing that, despite the terrible 
double tragedy of losing both of them,

1533
02:01:50,651 --> 02:01:54,497
Mike and Adam did at least live long 
enough to complete it.

1534
02:01:55,322 --> 02:01:59,270
And I really believe that, 
as people read these pages,

1535
02:01:59,326 --> 02:02:03,365
Adam's voice will keep on coming through 
for generations to come,

1536
02:02:03,463 --> 02:02:06,069
eloquent, strong and full of hope.

1537
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:10,338
Thanks to his words, he is with us still.

1538
02:02:11,805 --> 02:02:15,810
If I've left out anyone's name, 
I hope you'll forgive me.

1539
02:02:19,179 --> 02:02:21,284
But now I must make a toast.

1540
02:02:21,748 --> 02:02:24,592
To the memory of a great man

1541
02:02:25,919 --> 02:02:28,399
and a great patriot,

1542
02:02:28,455 --> 02:02:31,231
a wonderful husband and a devoted father.

1543
02:02:31,291 --> 02:02:32,292
To Adam!

1544
02:02:32,359 --> 02:02:33,838
