Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

509
00:28:44.561 --> 00:28:47.105
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut, Tommy.

510
00:28:47.188 --> 00:28:48.148
You did.

511
00:28:51.734 --> 00:28:52.861
You said get a good deal.

512
00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:55.572
I fail to recognise the correlation

513
00:28:55.655 --> 00:28:58.992
between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous,

514
00:28:59.075 --> 00:29:00.535
and a good deal.

515
00:29:01.161 --> 00:29:02.954
How're we gonna explain this to Brick Top?

516
00:29:03.037 --> 00:29:05.039
That his fight isn't gonna happen?

517
00:29:05.748 --> 00:29:07.000
We replace the fighter.

518
00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:09.127
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

519
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.212
And who the fuck
are we gonna replace him with?

520
00:29:11.796 --> 00:29:13.798
What about John The Gun?

521
00:29:14.257 --> 00:29:16.050
Or Mad Fist Willy?

522
00:29:16.134 --> 00:29:18.386
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you, Tommy?

523
00:29:18.928 --> 00:29:20.638
Mad Fist went mad,

524
00:29:20.722 --> 00:29:23.516
- and The Gun shot himself.
- [gunshot]

- What?
- Let's use the fucking pikey.

527
00:29:38.448 --> 00:29:40.617
- How much you gonna pay us?
- Ten K.

I'll do it for a caravan.

532

A what?

533
00:29:58.593 --> 00:29:59.969
[all] A caravan.

534
00:30:00.053 --> 00:30:03.306
- [Mickey] Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

535
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.476
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

536
00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.853
It's not for me. It's for me ma.

537
00:30:10.855 --> 00:30:11.689

538
00:30:11.773 --> 00:30:13.066

<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,

552

Shits himself
when you put him in the ring.

553
00:31:22.802 --> 00:31:25.054
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

554
00:31:26.514 --> 00:31:28.349
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

555
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.436
We've lost Gorgeous George.

Shh.

557
00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:37.442
You're gonna have to repeat that.

We've lost Gorgeous George.

559
00:31:41.237 --> 00:31:42.447
Well, where'd you lose him?

560
00:31:43.197 --> 00:31:45.783
He ain't a set of fucking car keys, is he?

561
00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:48.745
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, now is it?

562

We're not backing out.

563
00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:53.082
You bet your bollocks to a barn dance

We're changing the fighter.

Oh, fuck me, your lady friend got a voice?

And who might you be changing him to,

- Look, you've still got your fight.
- No.

572
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.440
I lose all bets at the bookies. You can't
change fighters at the last minute.

573
00:32:17.523 --> 00:32:21.444
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

574
00:32:21.527 --> 00:32:23.404
You can take bets at the fight.

575
00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:26.324
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

576

And you don't want to get bitten,
now do you, sweethearts?

577
00:32:34.457 --> 00:32:36.918
Make sure your man goes down

588

[Doug] I don't know, Avi. I'm not
his mother. But I'm seeing him later.

589
00:33:12.203 --> 00:33:15.081
- [Avi] When later?
- Well, he said he wanted cash.

590
00:33:15.164 --> 00:33:17.500
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

591
00:33:24.674 --> 00:33:25.675
A fight?

592
00:33:26.426 --> 00:33:29.804
What do you mean? What do you mean,
a fight? A boxing match?

593
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:35.643
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

594
00:33:35.726 --> 00:33:38.438
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

595
00:33:38.521 --> 00:33:40.440
And this schmuck is gambling?

596
00:33:40.523 --> 00:33:45.236
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

597
00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:47.071
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

598

Well, you're plenty fucking stupid,
I'll give you that.

599
00:33:49.532 --> 00:33:52.285
Do you have any idea
why they call him Franky Four Fingers?

600
00:33:52.368 --> 00:33:53.494
No, I have no idea.

601
00:33:54.036 --> 00:33:57.290
Well, because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

602
00:33:57.373 --> 00:34:00.042
And when he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop, Doug.

603
00:34:00.126 --> 00:34:02.462
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin either.

604
00:34:02.545 --> 00:34:04.505
Avi, I'm sure he can pay.

605
00:34:04.589 --> 00:34:08.301
Not with my goods, he isn't. You got
a toothbrush? We're going to London.

I don't like leaving my own country, Doug,

609

the concern I have for my friend Franky.

I'm gonna find him, Doug,
and you're gonna help me find him.

And why's that?

626
00:35:02.813 --> 00:35:07.860
Because the deal is, the Russian gets
the case, we get the money.

677
00:37:40.721 --> 00:37:41.931
You've got five fingers.

678
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:46.268
God! Copper coins.

679
00:37:47.144 --> 00:37:50.147
What do you mean, copper fucking coins?

00:37:53.943 --> 00:37:56.278
[alarm wailing]

681
00:37:58.781 --> 00:38:02.785
It won't open
because it's a security door.

682
00:38:02.868 --> 00:38:04.120
Hold that.

683
00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:10.084
[Vincent groans]

684
00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:11.460
Fuck.

685
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.255
My leg.

686
00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:20.219
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

687
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:30.521
We're fucked.

688
00:38:38.112 --> 00:38:39.530
What the fuck are you two doing?

689
00:38:39.613 --> 00:38:41.615
[jazzy music playing]

690
00:38:44.785 --> 00:38:45.911
[Sol] Get us out of here, Tyrone.

[tyres screech]

692
00:38:52.293 --> 00:38:54.628
- Tyrone, what are you doing?
- [both] Get us out of here!

693
00:39:02.094 --> 00:39:04.346
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

694
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:10.728
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

[dog squeaking and whimpering]

696

In the red corner,

697
00:39:15.649 --> 00:39:18.110
we have the young and unchallenged...

698
00:39:18.194 --> 00:39:22.698
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

699
00:39:22.782 --> 00:39:25.117
Just make sure he doesn't kill me
before the fourth.

700
00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:28.579
So give it up for the bone-crunching,

701
00:39:28.662 --> 00:39:31.290

702
00:39:31.373 --> 00:39:32.666

And in the other corner...

705
00:39:41.634 --> 00:39:43.928
Now, I know he looks like a fat fucker...

706
00:39:44.011 --> 00:39:46.972
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

707
00:39:47.056 --> 00:39:51.685
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

708
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.941
Now, try and look like a fighter.

709
00:39:57.024 --> 00:39:59.568
Let's get ready

Do you realise I've just dumped
fucking 40 grand down you?

714
00:40:39.316 --> 00:40:40.651
What's the fucking crack?

715
00:40:40.734 --> 00:40:43.487
- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't fucking happy.

716
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:46.490
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

717
00:40:47.408 --> 00:40:49.952
Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it.

718
00:40:51.912 --> 00:40:53.747
Well, thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

719
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.793
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone,

720
00:40:57.877 --> 00:40:59.670
I don't want to know if it tastes good.

721
00:40:59.753 --> 00:41:04.008
You stop me again whilst I'm walking
and I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

722
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:05.634

[traditional Russian music playing]

724
00:41:26.405 --> 00:41:28.657
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

725
00:41:36.498 --> 00:41:39.335
- What you doing with him?
- The case was attached to his arm.

726
00:41:39.418 --> 00:41:40.920
So why didn't you chop it off?

727
00:41:41.003 --> 00:41:43.756
Why? We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

728
00:41:44.465 --> 00:41:45.633
But he has the case.

729
00:41:46.342 --> 00:41:48.969
Look, we... Well, you have a problem.

730
00:41:49.053 --> 00:41:50.012
What?

731
00:41:50.095 --> 00:41:51.847
There weren't much cash at the bookies.

732
00:41:51.931 --> 00:41:53.724
Ah. Okay.

733
00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:57.227
- Here is the 10 grand.
- No.

734
00:41:57.311 --> 00:42:00.648
No. Keep it. We want this.

735
00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:03.025
Well, at least half of this.

736
00:42:03.943 --> 00:42:06.612
What was in the case was mine.

737
00:42:06.695 --> 00:42:09.406
What was in the bookies was yours. Okay?

738
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.286
Well, it wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

739
00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.372
No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.

740
00:42:16.455 --> 00:42:20.042
We want half of this,
and that's 'cause we're being generous.

741
00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:23.629
I mean, we could, by all rights,
keep the whole fucking stone, Boris.

742
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:35.182
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

743
00:42:37.977 --> 00:42:39.561
Drop the gun, fat boy.

744
00:42:43.273 --> 00:42:47.069
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

745
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.196
Give me the stone.

746
00:42:50.864 --> 00:42:52.700
- It's in the case.
- What?

747
00:42:54.785 --> 00:42:55.869
It's in the case.

748
00:42:55.953 --> 00:42:57.705
You put the stone in the case?

749
00:42:58.872 --> 00:43:00.749
Then open it and give me the stone.

750
00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:05.879
The only man who knew the combination,
you just shot.

Oink, oink.

Shit.

762
00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:06.690
So that's where you keep the sugar.

763
00:44:08.442 --> 00:44:11.528
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

764
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.948
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it, John?

765
00:44:15.032 --> 00:44:17.451
And we don't like hostility, do we, Errol?

766
00:44:18.327 --> 00:44:19.787
No, we don't, John.

767

Hey.

768
00:44:31.757 --> 00:44:33.509
I just had them polished.

769
00:44:39.389 --> 00:44:41.016
Go and put the kettle on.

770
00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:47.606
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

Okay?

775
00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:16.552
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body,

776
00:45:16.635 --> 00:45:20.013
but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

Well, look at him.

00:45:31.692 --> 00:45:34.862
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

780
00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:39.324
All right. Of course.

00:45:39.408 --> 00:45:41.201
Of course, fucking of course.

784
00:45:47.416 --> 00:45:51.336
I do want him to go down in the fourth.

785
00:45:52.129 --> 00:45:55.674
And I do mean it, this time.

786
00:46:05.267 --> 00:46:09.146
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

787
00:46:12.107 --> 00:46:13.609
So now you can open it.

788
00:46:14.735 --> 00:46:17.196
He's been a busy little bastard,
that Turkish.

789
00:46:17.279 --> 00:46:19.323
I think you've let him get away
with enough already, governor.

790
00:46:19.406 --> 00:46:21.783
It can get you
in a lot of trouble, thinking, Errol.

791
00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:23.535
I shouldn't do so much of it.

792
00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:25.704
Right. That takes care
of one little piggy.

793
00:46:25.787 --> 00:46:28.874
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

794
00:46:28.957 --> 00:46:30.250

You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you, Tommy? Where'd they come from?

800
00:46:58.445 --> 00:47:00.030
You're looking for my boy, are you?

801
00:47:00.864 --> 00:47:02.324
[Turkish] Do you know
where I can find him?

802
00:47:02.407 --> 00:47:03.408
Yeah.

803
00:47:04.576 --> 00:47:06.703
Don't suppose you'd like to share
that information with me, would you?

804
00:47:06.787 --> 00:47:09.373
I don't want you getting my boy
into any trouble. Do you hear me?

805
00:47:10.457 --> 00:47:13.168
He's my only boy. And he's a good boy.

806
00:47:15.337 --> 00:47:16.797
He's coursing.

807
00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:21.593
- What's coursing?
- Hare coursing.

808
00:47:22.803 --> 00:47:26.848
They set two lurchers...
They're dogs, before you ask.

On a hare.

810
00:47:29.685 --> 00:47:33.063
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

811
00:47:33.146 --> 00:47:34.564
So, what if it doesn't?

812
00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:39.319
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

813

00:47:45.909 --> 00:47:46.952

[Errol] I know a lot of tits, governor,

as fucking stupid as these two.

- On what?

825
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.067
On you buying this caravan.

826
00:48:19.818 --> 00:48:22.321
Ah, not the rouge one. The rose.

827
00:48:22.904 --> 00:48:25.115
- It's not the same caravan.
- It's not the same fight.

828
00:48:25.198 --> 00:48:27.326
It's twice the size of the last one.

829
00:48:27.409 --> 00:48:28.952
Turkish, the fight is twice the size.

830
00:48:29.036 --> 00:48:30.495
And me ma still needs a caravan.

831
00:48:30.579 --> 00:48:33.749

It's a fair deal. Take it.

Eh, save your breath
for cooling your porridge.

837

Have I made myself clear, boys?

842

Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.
Yeah.

is cut up a corpse into six pieces

Then I hear the best thing to do
is feed them to pigs.

919
00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:51.042
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days,

You could do this afterwards, of course,

925

You need at least 16 pigs

who keeps a pig farm.

00:55:25.702 --> 00:55:27.704
That means that a single pig

1183
01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:10.419
The human digestive system hasn't got used
to any dairy products yet.

1184
01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:13.547
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1185
01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:15.132
Let me do you a favour.

1186
01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.676
[tyres screeching]

1187
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.053
[car crashes]

1188
01:10:20.721 --> 01:10:21.805
[both] Whoops.

1189
01:10:21.889 --> 01:10:23.515
You. Want a knife?

1190
01:10:23.599 --> 01:10:26.477
Me? Oh, no, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

1191
01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.270
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1192
01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:30.731
What have you used to keep
your fork company all these years?

1193
01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:34.401
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1194
01:10:34.485 --> 01:10:36.403
[tyres screeching]

1195
01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:44.578
[Boris grunting]

1196
01:10:46.372 --> 01:10:47.790
[Boris speaking in Russian]

1197
01:10:56.632 --> 01:10:57.883
Is that Boris?

1198
01:10:59.968 --> 01:11:01.970
[traditional Russian music playing]

1199
01:11:10.938 --> 01:11:13.565
- [Tyrone screaming]
- [tyres screeching]

1200
01:11:15.734 --> 01:11:17.945
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1201
01:11:19.697 --> 01:11:21.281
What about Rosebud?

1202
01:11:21.365 --> 01:11:23.784
Well, you can bring him with you
if you like.

1203
01:11:25.619 --> 01:11:27.121
But which bit would you like to bring?

1204
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:33.544
- [Vincent] They're getting out.
- [Sol] Hold on.

1205
01:11:33.627 --> 01:11:36.046
Get down and follow them.

1206
01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:37.673
[Tony] Cover yourself up, Avi.

1207
01:11:38.257 --> 01:11:39.883
You're making a scene.

1208
01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:42.010
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1209
01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:46.181
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1210
01:11:46.265 --> 01:11:47.850
Well, I can't leave him in here, can I?

1211
01:11:54.815 --> 01:11:56.525
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1212
01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:01.780
I thought you wanted to get cleaned up.
Bathroom's back there.

1213
01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:05.909
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1214
01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:07.578
Should we go in?

1215
01:12:08.162 --> 01:12:11.331
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1216
01:12:11.957 --> 01:12:15.461
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1217
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:18.756
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1218
01:12:19.965 --> 01:12:22.926
I don't care
if he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1219
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.013
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1220
01:12:27.306 --> 01:12:30.434
My God, Tommy,
you certainly got those minerals.

1221
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:34.354
Well, come on, then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1222
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:36.940
You just tell him who's in charge.

1223
01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:39.693
[Boris speaking in Russian]

1224
01:12:39.777 --> 01:12:41.779
[traditional Russian music playing]

1225
01:12:43.322 --> 01:12:46.033
Uh, Boris... [grunting]

1226
01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:49.745
Fucking hell.

1227
01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:51.330
You certainly told him, Tommy.

1228
01:12:53.415 --> 01:12:54.583
[chuckles]

1229
01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:56.210
[speaking in Russian]

1230
01:12:58.253 --> 01:12:59.671
The Drowning Trout.

1231
01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:03.342
Come and pick us up.

1232
01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:04.968
And, Doug...

1233
01:13:05.886 --> 01:13:06.970
sharpish.

1234
01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:30.953
I don't want a fuss and I don't want
to put a bullet in your face,

1235
01:13:31.036 --> 01:13:33.163
but unless you give me exactly
what I want,

1236
01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:34.873
there will be fucking murders.

1237
01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:38.627
What's your name?

1238
01:13:39.628 --> 01:13:40.462
Shoot him.

1239
01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:41.713
Ooh.

1240
01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:50.931
Let go of the gun.

1241
01:13:57.479 --> 01:14:00.774
So you're obviously the big dick

1242
01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.944
and on either side of you are your balls.

1243
01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:06.822
There are two types of balls:

1244
01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:12.244
There are big brave balls,
and there are little, mincy faggot balls.

1245
01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:15.038
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1246
01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:17.791
Your dicks have drive
and clarity of vision,

1247
01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:20.002
but they're not clever.

1248
01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:24.172
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1249
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.509
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy

1250
01:14:28.427 --> 01:14:31.263
and have brought your two little,
mincy faggot balls along

1251
01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:32.723
for a good old time.

1252
01:14:33.891 --> 01:14:35.559
But you've got your parties muddled up.

1253
01:14:37.269 --> 01:14:38.896
There's no pussy here,

1254
01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:42.232
just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1255
01:14:43.942 --> 01:14:45.152
Like a prick,

1256
01:14:46.653 --> 01:14:48.322
you're having second thoughts.

1257
01:14:49.197 --> 01:14:50.407
You're shrinking.

1258
01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:54.036
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1259
01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:59.291
And the fact that you've got "Replica"
written down the side of your gun...

1260
01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:09.051
...and the fact
that I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...

1261
01:15:11.511 --> 01:15:12.846
...written on the side of mine...

1262
01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:19.853
...should precipitate...

1263
01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:24.483
your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1264
01:15:27.361 --> 01:15:28.236
Now...

1265
01:15:31.365 --> 01:15:32.699
fuck off.

1266
01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:39.331
["Ghost Town" playing]

1267
01:15:48.131 --> 01:15:49.132
Lock the door.

1268
01:15:49.758 --> 01:15:50.717
Lock it!

1269
01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:53.428
[Vincent grunts]

1270
01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.350
Give me the case.

1271
01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.102
Fuck you.

1272
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:02.729
Shoot me.

1273
01:16:02.813 --> 01:16:04.523
I will. I'll shoot you.

1274
01:16:06.441 --> 01:16:09.194
[men arguing indistinctly]

1275
01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.245
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1276
01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.122
You know what?

1277
01:16:20.914 --> 01:16:22.040
Fuck you too.

1278
01:16:22.666 --> 01:16:26.003
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing me
a favour, you Russian fuck. Go ahead!

1279
01:16:26.086 --> 01:16:28.088
You! Drop guns.

1280
01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:30.465
Fuck you!

1281
01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:32.134
You drop the gun!

1282
01:16:33.844 --> 01:16:35.262
[Boris] Okay.

1283
01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:37.347
[Tony] Avi...

1284
01:16:37.431 --> 01:16:38.682
pull your socks up!

1285
01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:54.614
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1286
01:16:56.575 --> 01:16:57.826
[Boris] Give me the case.

1287
01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:04.458
[jazzy music playing]

1288
01:17:10.797 --> 01:17:11.715
Avi...

1289
01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:15.385
- where's the case?
- [Avi] Put the gun away.

1290
01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:18.055
[Tony] What's Boris doing here?

1291
01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:21.725
Boris, what are you doing here?

1292
01:17:21.808 --> 01:17:23.143
[Boris] Fuck you!

1293
01:17:32.486 --> 01:17:33.612
Where's the case?

1294
01:17:34.738 --> 01:17:38.033
- [Boris grunts] You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1295
01:17:38.116 --> 01:17:40.160
[Boris] I'll show you now.

1296
01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:44.998
Fuck you!

1297
01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:51.129
Almost had it.

1298
01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:53.006
For fuck's sake.

1299
01:17:57.928 --> 01:17:59.679
- Fuck you and all.
- [gun clicks]

1300
01:18:01.348 --> 01:18:03.558
You lucky bastard.

1301
01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:05.644
[door opens]

1302
01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:08.480
[door closes]

1303
01:18:10.065 --> 01:18:11.942
Jeez, it's flawless.

1304
01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:15.195
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1305
01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:17.239
Leave the dog here.

1306
01:18:17.322 --> 01:18:22.577
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent,

1307
01:18:22.661 --> 01:18:25.497
and it'll get a lot fucking shorter
if Brick Top wishes it to be.

1308
01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:28.917
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1309
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.335
Don't worry about it!

1310
01:18:30.418 --> 01:18:33.880
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1311

[dog whimpering]

1312
01:18:35.799 --> 01:18:36.967
It's okay.

1313
01:18:37.759 --> 01:18:39.219
Sit down. Down.

1314
01:18:41.513 --> 01:18:42.597
[squeaks]

1315
01:18:44.474 --> 01:18:47.644
[Vincent] I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1316
01:18:47.727 --> 01:18:49.521
[Sol] Well, we won't if you don't.

1317
01:18:50.939 --> 01:18:53.066
All right, you give me the stone,

1318
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:55.986
and I will give it to Brick Top. Yeah?

1319
01:18:57.154 --> 01:19:00.490
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1320
01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:06.621
What is it doing down there?

1321
01:19:07.497 --> 01:19:09.875
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1322
01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:12.669
You ain't from this planet,
are you, Vincent?

1323
01:19:12.752 --> 01:19:16.756
Who is gonna mug
two Black fellas holding pistols,

1324
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.801
sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1325
01:19:23.555 --> 01:19:27.434
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1326
01:19:27.517 --> 01:19:29.477
What have they got to do with anything?

1327
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:32.105
They're both staring straight at me.

1328
01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:39.279
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1329
01:19:40.113 --> 01:19:41.489
Now out of the car.

1330
01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:43.408
And leave your water pistols behind.

1331
01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:48.163
Look, just... Just tell him
the stone's back at the office.

1332
01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:49.915
I'll think of something.

1333
01:19:55.086 --> 01:19:58.298
- [Turkish] Why's he sweating, Gorgeous?
- [grunting]

1334
01:19:58.381 --> 01:19:59.716
Oh, never mind.

1335
01:19:59.799 --> 01:20:02.427
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1336
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:06.306
- I'm a little worried, actually, Turkish.
- Worried about what?

1337
01:20:07.265 --> 01:20:10.560
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1338
01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:13.480
I mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?

1339
01:20:13.563 --> 01:20:15.523
We get murdered
before we leave the building,

1340
01:20:15.607 --> 01:20:17.776
and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.

1341
01:20:18.693 --> 01:20:22.030
Well, I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1342
01:20:24.115 --> 01:20:28.078
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1343
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:30.163
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one, Tommy.

1344
01:20:30.997 --> 01:20:33.959
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1345
01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:39.547
[Turkish] <i>You know those gypsies like
a drink at a wake.</i>

1346
01:20:40.465 --> 01:20:42.968
I'm not worried about whether
Mickey knocks the other man out.

1347
01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:47.389
I'm worried about whether Mickey makes it
to the fourth fucking round.

1348
01:20:47.472 --> 01:20:50.308
[Tommy] <i>Well, what if he doesn't
make it to the fourth round?</i>

1349
01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:52.769
We get murdered
before leaving the building,

1350
01:20:52.852 --> 01:20:55.689
and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.

1351
01:20:58.441 --> 01:20:59.985
So why are you so calm?

1352
01:21:01.236 --> 01:21:03.697
- I said...
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1353
01:21:04.322 --> 01:21:06.533
It's not as though
we've got a choice, now, is it?

1354
01:21:07.242 --> 01:21:09.911
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy

1355
01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:14.332
and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1356
01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:17.961
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

Oh, that fucking dog.

1360

Go on, get the dog.

1361
01:22:04.174 --> 01:22:06.593

- Open a window.

You people live like animals.

1364
01:22:18.396 --> 01:22:19.564
Now, where's the stone?

1365
01:22:20.315 --> 01:22:22.442
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1366
01:22:22.525 --> 01:22:26.112
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1367

It's empty.

1368

I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1369
01:22:36.498 --> 01:22:38.083
No, I'm being serious.

1370
01:22:38.792 --> 01:22:41.461

Now, then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1373
01:22:49.677 --> 01:22:51.679
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1374
01:22:53.973 --> 01:22:55.558
What do you mean, "look in the dog"?

1375
01:22:55.642 --> 01:22:56.893
I mean, open him up.

1376
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:04.567
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1377

You know what I mean.

1378
01:23:09.197 --> 01:23:10.365
That's a bit strong, isn't it?

1379
01:23:12.325 --> 01:23:13.410
I don't know about this.

It's fucking squeaking!

1383

What's the matter?
You never heard a dog squeak before?

1384
01:23:23.044 --> 01:23:24.504

Tony, come on!

1397
01:24:32.572 --> 01:24:33.448
Tony?

1398
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.880
- [man] Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1399
01:24:51.424 --> 01:24:53.635
[Vincent] That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite, Sol.

1400
01:24:53.718 --> 01:24:55.428
I'm telling you. It always does.

1401
01:24:55.512 --> 01:24:57.847
How's the dog gonna find
the campsite, Vin?

1402
01:24:57.931 --> 01:25:00.141
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1403
01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:03.311
All right. But we're gonna have
to wait until it gets light.

1404
01:25:03.394 --> 01:25:05.647
And we have to get rid of these bodies.

1405
01:25:05.730 --> 01:25:08.608
That one over there with the tea cosy
on his head's starting to stink.

1406
01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:13.738
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1407
01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:19.077
[echoing] Mickey.

1408
01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:22.330
Oi, Mickey!

1409

[groaning]

1411

Need a drink.

1412
01:25:33.466 --> 01:25:35.051
You can't give him a drink!

1413
01:25:35.134 --> 01:25:36.636
It's not for him. It's for me.

1414
01:25:42.684 --> 01:25:44.978
Ah, mates. Amen.

1415
01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:54.195
He's a hard bastard,
this Good Night Anderson,

1416
01:25:54.279 --> 01:25:56.281
so pay attention to what you're doing.

1417
01:25:57.156 --> 01:25:59.242
- All right, Mickey?
- [snoring]

1418

Mickey!

Need to have a shite!

1420
01:26:08.084 --> 01:26:12.046
If you see the pikey, Turkish
or his girlfriend come out before me,

1421
01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.465
shoot the bastards.

1422
01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.095
Well, come on. We got a fight to go to.

1423

[indistinct chatter]

1424
01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.021
All right, Tom.

1425
01:26:29.147 --> 01:26:31.357
Hope we're gonna get
a better show this time.

1426
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:33.234
This will make up for it.

1427
01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:36.154
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1428
01:26:36.237 --> 01:26:38.573
Now, Terry over there is
in charge of the bets.

1429
01:26:39.115 --> 01:26:40.742
Now, you have to forgive me.

1430
01:26:40.825 --> 01:26:42.952
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1431
01:26:46.956 --> 01:26:49.917
- Are our lads down at the campsite?
- They're over there now, governor.

1432
01:26:53.046 --> 01:26:54.922
[man 1] I fucking hate pikeys.

1433
01:26:57.300 --> 01:26:58.676
[man 2] How long have we gotta stay here?

1434
01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.762
As long as it takes. Now shut up.

1435
01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:04.015
Fucking hate pikeys.

1436
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:07.018
Is he fucking stoned?

1437
01:27:07.977 --> 01:27:09.520
He's like that before a fight.

1438
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:12.023
Do you know when you're going down?

1439
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:15.360
Of course he knows when he's going down.

1440
01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:19.197
Oi, fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1441
01:27:20.073 --> 01:27:23.201
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1442
01:27:23.284 --> 01:27:25.703
I'll remember that next time
I'm climbing off your mum.

1443
01:27:25.787 --> 01:27:29.207
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1444
01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:32.251
Be a nice one. Nice one.
Hell of a way to be a war.

1445
01:27:32.335 --> 01:27:33.711
And there none of yours.

[laughing]

1447
01:27:35.254 --> 01:27:39.050
There's a campsite full of pikeys that
might not think you're so fucking funny.

1448
01:27:39.133 --> 01:27:41.886
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1449

No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

Talk about saved by the bell.

Do you understand the consequences
of what would happen

1461
01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:14.038
