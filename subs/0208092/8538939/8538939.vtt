You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut, Tommy.

511
00:29:08.308 --> 00:29:09.267
You did.

512
00:29:12.854 --> 00:29:13.980
You said get a good deal.

513
00:29:14.064 --> 00:29:16.691

hospitalizing Gorgeous,

How're we gonna explain this to Brick Top?

517

518

We replace the fighter.

Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

520

are we gonna replace him with?

-[Avi] When later?
-Well, he said he wanted cash.

-It's a boxing match, Avi.

-Yes, he had a case.

why they call him Franky Four Fingers?

No, I have no idea.

602
00:34:15.156 --> 00:34:18.409
Well, because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

603
00:34:18.493 --> 00:34:21.162
And when he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop, Doug.

his fucking foreskin either.

What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

688
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.641
We're fucked.

So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

700
00:39:43.902 --> 00:39:46.237
Just make sure he doesn't kill me
before the fourth.

701
00:39:46.321 --> 00:39:49.699

I don't want to know if it tastes good.

Why? We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

What?

732
00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:12.966
There weren't much cash at the bookies.

Ah. Okay.

734
00:42:16.721 --> 00:42:18.347
-Here is the 10 grand.
-No.

735
00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:21.767
No. Keep it. We want this.

736
00:42:21.851 --> 00:42:24.144
Well, at least half of this.

737
00:42:25.063 --> 00:42:27.732
What was in the case was mine.

738
00:42:27.815 --> 00:42:30.526
What was in the bookies was yours. Okay?

739
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.405
Well, it wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

740

No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.

741
00:42:37.575 --> 00:42:41.161
We want half of this,
and that's 'cause we're being generous.

742
00:42:41.245 --> 00:42:44.748
I mean, we could, by all rights,
keep the whole fucking stone, Boris.

He could not know my name.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.316
Give me the stone.

-It's in the case.
-What?

00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:16.989
It's in the case.

749
00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:18.824
You put the stone in the case?

750
00:43:19.992 --> 00:43:21.868
Then open it and give me the stone.

Yeah.

804
00:47:25.696 --> 00:47:27.823
Don't suppose you'd like to share
that information with me, would you?

into any trouble. Do you hear me?

-It's not the same fight.

Then I hear the best thing to do
is feed them to pigs.

920
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.162
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days,

You could do this afterwards, of course,

01:10:24.615 --> 01:10:27.242
Before that, they were running around
as mad as lorries.

1184
01:10:27.326 --> 01:10:31.538
The human digestive system hasn't got used
to any dairy products yet.

1185
01:10:31.622 --> 01:10:34.666
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1186
01:10:34.751 --> 01:10:36.252
Let me do you a favor.

1187
01:10:37.211 --> 01:10:38.795
[tires screeching]

1188
01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.172
[car crashes]

1189
01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:42.925
[both] Whoops.

1190
01:10:43.009 --> 01:10:44.635
You. Want a knife?

1191
01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:47.596
Me? Oh, no, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

1192
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.390
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1193
01:10:49.474 --> 01:10:51.851
What have you used to keep
your fork company all these years?

1194
01:10:51.934 --> 01:10:55.520
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1195
01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:57.523
[tires screeching]

1196
01:11:03.696 --> 01:11:05.698
[Boris grunting]

1197
01:11:07.492 --> 01:11:08.910
[Boris speaking in Russian]

1198
01:11:17.752 --> 01:11:19.003
Is that Boris?

1199
01:11:21.088 --> 01:11:23.090
[traditional Russian music playing]

1200
01:11:32.058 --> 01:11:34.685
-[Tyrone screaming]
-[tires screeching]

1201
01:11:36.854 --> 01:11:39.064
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1202
01:11:40.817 --> 01:11:42.401
What about Rosebud?

1203
01:11:42.485 --> 01:11:44.904
Well, you can bring him with you
if you like.

1204
01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:48.240
But which bit would you like to bring?

1205
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.663
-[Vincent] They're getting out.
-[Sol] Hold on.

1206
01:11:54.747 --> 01:11:57.166
Get down and follow them.

1207
01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:58.793
[Tony] Cover yourself up, Avi.

1208
01:11:59.377 --> 01:12:01.003
You're making a scene.

1209
01:12:01.087 --> 01:12:03.130
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1210
01:12:04.257 --> 01:12:07.301
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1211
01:12:07.385 --> 01:12:08.969
Well, I can't leave him in here, can I?

1212
01:12:15.935 --> 01:12:17.645
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1213
01:12:19.605 --> 01:12:22.899
I thought you wanted to get cleaned up.
Bathroom's back there.

1214
01:12:23.693 --> 01:12:27.029
-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1215
01:12:27.655 --> 01:12:28.697
Should we go in?

1216
01:12:29.282 --> 01:12:32.451
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1217
01:12:33.077 --> 01:12:36.580
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1218
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:39.875
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1219
01:12:41.085 --> 01:12:44.046
I don't care
if he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1220
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.133
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1221
01:12:48.426 --> 01:12:51.554
My God, Tommy,
you certainly got those minerals.

1222
01:12:52.471 --> 01:12:55.474
Well, come on, then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1223
01:12:56.309 --> 01:12:58.060
You just tell him who's in charge.

1224
01:12:58.978 --> 01:13:00.813
[Boris speaking in Russian]

01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:02.899
[traditional Russian music playing]

1226
01:13:04.442 --> 01:13:07.153
Uh, Boris-- [grunting]

1227
01:13:08.946 --> 01:13:10.864
Fucking hell.

1228
01:13:10.948 --> 01:13:12.449
You certainly told him, Tommy.

1229
01:13:14.535 --> 01:13:15.702
[chuckles]

1230
01:13:15.786 --> 01:13:17.329
[speaking in Russian]

1231
01:13:19.373 --> 01:13:20.791
The Drowning Trout.

1232
01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:24.462
Come and pick us up.

1233
01:13:25.129 --> 01:13:26.088
And, Doug...

1234
01:13:27.006 --> 01:13:28.090
sharpish.

1235
01:13:49.153 --> 01:13:52.072
I don't want a fuss and I don't want
to put a bullet in your face,

1236
01:13:52.156 --> 01:13:54.283
but unless you give me exactly
what I want,

1237
01:13:54.367 --> 01:13:55.993
there will be fucking murders.

1238
01:13:58.663 --> 01:13:59.747
What's your name?

1239
01:14:00.748 --> 01:14:01.582
Shoot him.

1240
01:14:01.666 --> 01:14:02.833
Ooh.

1241
01:14:09.048 --> 01:14:12.051
Let go of the gun.

1242
01:14:18.599 --> 01:14:21.893
So you're obviously the big dick

1243
01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:25.063
and on either side of you are your balls.

1244
01:14:26.315 --> 01:14:27.941
There are two types of balls:

1245
01:14:29.485 --> 01:14:33.363
There are big brave balls,
and there are little, mincy faggot balls.

1246
01:14:33.447 --> 01:14:36.158
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1247
01:14:36.742 --> 01:14:38.910
Your dicks have drive
and clarity of vision,

1248
01:14:40.037 --> 01:14:41.121
but they're not clever.

1249
01:14:42.039 --> 01:14:45.292
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1250
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:48.629
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy

1251
01:14:49.547 --> 01:14:52.383
and have brought your two little,
mincy faggot balls along

1252
01:14:52.466 --> 01:14:53.842
for a good old time.

1253
01:14:55.011 --> 01:14:56.679
But you've got your parties muddled up.

1254
01:14:58.389 --> 01:15:00.015
There's no pussy here,

1255
01:15:00.891 --> 01:15:03.351
just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1256
01:15:05.062 --> 01:15:06.271
Like a prick,

1257
01:15:07.773 --> 01:15:09.441
you're having second thoughts.

1258
01:15:10.317 --> 01:15:11.526
You're shrinking.

1259
01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:15.156
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1260
01:15:16.907 --> 01:15:20.410
And the fact that you've got "Replica"
written down the side of your gun...

1261
01:15:25.458 --> 01:15:29.958
...and the fact
that I've got "Desert Eagle .50"...

1262
01:15:32.631 --> 01:15:33.965
...written on the side of mine...

1263
01:15:39.472 --> 01:15:40.973
...should precipitate...

1264
01:15:42.475 --> 01:15:45.603
your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1265
01:15:48.481 --> 01:15:49.356
Now...

1266
01:15:52.485 --> 01:15:53.819
fuck off.

Look it!

1271

Fuck you.

1273
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:23.849
Shoot me.

1274
01:16:23.933 --> 01:16:25.643
I will. I'll shoot you.

You know what?

01:16:42.034 --> 01:16:43.160
Fuck you too.

1279
01:16:43.786 --> 01:16:47.122
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be doing me
a favor, you Russian fuck. Go ahead!

Jeez, it's flawless.

Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

Leave the dog here.

-Because life's too short, Vincent,

if Brick Top wishes it to be.

All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

are you, Vincent?

than your shirt?

Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

What have they got to do with anything?

They're both staring straight at me.

You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1330
01:20:01.233 --> 01:20:02.609
Now out of the car.

1331
01:20:02.693 --> 01:20:04.528
And leave your water pistols behind.

Look, just-- Just tell him
the stone's back at the office.

1333

Oh, never mind.

-I'm a little worried, actually, Turkish.
-Worried about what?

1338
01:20:28.385 --> 01:20:31.679
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1339
01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:34.599
I mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?

1340
01:20:34.683 --> 01:20:36.643
We get murdered
before we leave the building,

1341
01:20:36.727 --> 01:20:38.895
and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.

1342
01:20:39.813 --> 01:20:43.149
Well, I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1343
01:20:45.235 --> 01:20:49.197
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1344
01:20:49.281 --> 01:20:51.283
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one, Tommy.

I'm not worried about whether
Mickey knocks the other man out.

1348
01:21:05.214 --> 01:21:08.508
I'm worried about whether Mickey makes it
to the fourth fucking round.

1349
01:21:08.592 --> 01:21:11.428
[Tommy] <i>Well, what if he doesn't
make it to the fourth round?</i>

1350
01:21:11.512 --> 01:21:13.889
We get murdered
before leaving the building,

Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1404
01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:24.431
All right. But we're gonna have
to wait until it gets light.

1405
01:25:24.514 --> 01:25:26.766
And we have to get rid of these bodies.

1406

That one over there with the tea cozy
on his head's starting to stink.

Hope we're gonna get
a better show this time.

This will make up for it.

Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1429
01:26:57.357 --> 01:26:59.692
Now, Terry over there is
in charge of the bets.

1430

Now, you have to forgive me.

1431
01:27:01.945 --> 01:27:04.072
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

-They're over there now, governor.

1440

Of course he knows when he's going down.
