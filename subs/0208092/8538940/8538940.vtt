00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.430
<i>My name is Turkish.</i>

2
00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:37.807
<i>Funny name for an Englishman,
I know.</i>

3
00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:42.437
<i>My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.</i>

4
00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.064
<i>They named me after the plane.</i>

5
00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.859
<i>Not many people are
named after a plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:48.443 --> 00:00:50.069
<i>That's Tommy.</i>

7
00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:52.489
<i>He tells people
he was named after a gun.</i>

8
00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:57.198
<i>But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.</i>

9
00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.039
<i>Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.</i>

10
00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.708
<i>Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.</i>

11
00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:08.417
<i>It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.</i>

12
00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:12.049
<i>I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.</i>

13
00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.345
<i>But really, he's like my brother.</i>

14
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:19.098
<i>What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.</i>

15
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:23.228
<i>I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:</i>

16
00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.064
<i>What do I know about diamonds?</i>

17
00:01:26.273 --> 00:01:28.400
<i>Don't they come from Antwerp?</i>

18
00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.654
<i>-Himy, would you listen to this?
-Do we have a choice?</i>

19
00:01:32.904 --> 00:01:35.656
<i>It wasn't meant to be taken
literally.</i>

20
00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:38.701
<i>It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.</i>

21
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.872
<i>It's bound with moral fiber,</i>

22
00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.709
<i>but asking a grown man to believe it?</i>

23
00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:48.252
<i>What is it?</i>

24
00:01:50.464 --> 00:01:52.007
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

25
00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:56.636
<i>What you want I should do,
drop my pants?</i>

26
00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:58.596
<i>Okay, go through.</i>

27
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.058
<i>It's a nice story.</i>

28
00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:05.686
<i>It's just that. Just a story.</i>

29
00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:09.398
<i>Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.</i>

30
00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:11.901
<i>Enough already.
Ruben, say something.</i>

31
00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:14.904
<i>Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.</i>

32
00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:19.367
<i>The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"</i>

33
00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:21.786
<i>into the Greek word for "virgin."</i>

34
00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.456
<i>it was an easy mistake to make</i>

35
00:02:24.706 --> 00:02:29.206
<i>because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.</i>

36
00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:41.598
<i>So, they came up with a prophecy:</i>

37
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.019
<i>"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son."</i>

38
00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:50.023
<i>You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.</i>

39
00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:53.860
<i>It's not every day a virgin conceives
and bears a son.</i>

40
00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:15.131
<i>But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew,</i>

41
00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.927
<i>and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.</i>

42
00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:22.346
<i>Oy way, what are you saying?</i>

43
00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:25.141
<i>I'm saying, just because
it's written</i>

44
00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:26.935
<i>doesn't make it so.</i>

45
00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:31.105
<i>Gives them hope. it's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.</i>

46
00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:33.816
<i>-People like to believe.
-I don't want to hear any more.</i>

47
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:37.278
<i>Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?</i>

48
00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:39.614
<i>-Michael.
-Hello?</i>

49
00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:42.533
<i>Mutti.</i>

50
00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:46.496
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:49.207 --> 00:03:52.627
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:53.795
-Michael.
-Mutti.

53
00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:58.796
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:06.474
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:10.061
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:12.606
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:12.773 --> 00:04:14.149
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:17.651
-Get down!
-Get fucking down!

59
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.113
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.739
On the ground!

61
00:04:26.077 --> 00:04:27.745
Get down! Get down, I say!

62
00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:30.039
-Time.
-Seven minutes!

63
00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:35.378
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:40.675
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.929
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:51.560
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:17.772 --> 00:06:19.899
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.151
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:24.487
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:38.001
When you get to London,

71
00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:40.127
if you want a gun,

72
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:42.172
call this number.

73
00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:48.969
-Boris.
-Boris.

74
00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:52.473
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:06:59.397 --> 00:07:01.524
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:07:01.816 --> 00:07:06.028
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:07:06.488 --> 00:07:08.323
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:07:09.282 --> 00:07:11.200
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

79
00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:12.786
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:14.454 --> 00:07:18.249
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:19.959
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.171
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:23.463 --> 00:07:25.006
Why me?

84
00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:27.633
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:29.301
How's that?

86
00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:33.014
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:33.223 --> 00:07:36.559
And I don't wanna have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:38.060
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:41.606
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:43.691
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.735
I'm just not sure about the color.

92
00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:50.114
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.158
Here's an address.

94
00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.328
It's a campsite.

95
00:07:56.162 --> 00:07:59.915
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.878
-What's happening with them sausages?
-Five minutes.

97
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:08.716
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:10.551
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:13.555
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:16.390
You're a sensitive boy, aren't you, Tommy.

101
00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:21.187
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:21.688 --> 00:08:24.273
-What's that?
-It's me belt, Turkish.

103
00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:26.859
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.279
-What's a gun doing in your trousers?
-It's for protection.

105
00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:31.698
Protection from what?

106
00:08:31.948 --> 00:08:33.783
"Zee" Germans?

107
00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:37.203
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off every time you sit down?

108
00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:40.665
-Where did you get it?
-Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.418
You mean Boris the sneaky
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.669
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:48.840
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:48.923 --> 00:08:51.050
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:53.928
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:54.179 --> 00:08:57.265
<i>Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.</i>

115
00:08:57.515 --> 00:09:01.810
<i>Bent as the Soviet sickle and
as hard as the hammer that crosses it.</i>

116
00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:05.773
<i>Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.</i>

117
00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:09.068
<i>Back to my partner, Tommy.</i>

118
00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:12.863
<i>Tommy runs the other business,
slot machines,</i>

119
00:09:12.947 --> 00:09:16.825
<i>which keeps rain off our heads
and the gloves on Gorgeous' hands.</i>

120
00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:21.493
<i>However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.</i>

121
00:09:22.373 --> 00:09:23.874
All right, I'll take it.

122
00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:28.045
<i>There's a reason for Tommy's
newfound enthusiasm for firearms.</i>

123
00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:32.838
<i>Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:</i>

124
00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:34.260
<i>Brick Top.</i>

125
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.180
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

126
00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:40.516
-He doesn't look bad, does he?
-No, he looks great.

127
00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.143
He'll do you proud.

128
00:09:42.352 --> 00:09:46.522
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

129
00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:47.773
It's what you deserve.

130
00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:50.401
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

131
00:09:51.444 --> 00:09:52.695
Dogs do that.

132
00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:55.197
You're not a dog, are you?

133
00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:56.866
No. No, I'm not.

134
00:09:57.242 --> 00:09:58.534
However...

135
00:09:59.536 --> 00:10:03.039
you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

136
00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:04.540
All except loyalty.

137
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.920
<i>It's rumored that his favorite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun,</i>

138
00:10:09.003 --> 00:10:13.503
<i>a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.</i>

139
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.221
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

140
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:23.225
But I got no time for grouses.

141
00:10:25.228 --> 00:10:27.396
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

142
00:10:28.898 --> 00:10:31.108
What the fuck are you two looking at?

143
00:10:33.987 --> 00:10:38.408
<i>If you got to deal with him, just make
sure you don't end up owing him.</i>

144
00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:39.826
<i>Then you're in his debt.</i>

145
00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:42.203
<i>Which means, you're in his pocket.</i>

146
00:10:42.287 --> 00:10:45.290
<i>And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.</i>

147
00:10:46.207 --> 00:10:49.668
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'm gonna use him.

148
00:10:49.752 --> 00:10:52.129
I'll be doing you a favor, boy.

149
00:10:52.338 --> 00:10:55.382
<i>What he means is,
I'm doing him a favor.</i>

150
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.050
<i>Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights, unlike his.</i>

151
00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:03.558
Here, Errol, I don't think he likes me.

152
00:11:04.309 --> 00:11:05.643
You don't like me, do you?

153
00:11:05.852 --> 00:11:07.103
Don't know what you mean.

154
00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:11.274
<i>I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.</i>

155
00:11:11.357 --> 00:11:15.857
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

156
00:11:16.237 --> 00:11:18.489
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

157
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.283
<i>You can sort me out
by showing me out.</i>

158
00:11:21.492 --> 00:11:24.328
<i>It's hard enough to make a living
in boxing, so now and then,</i>

159
00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:27.665
<i>you do something against your principles.</i>

160
00:11:27.749 --> 00:11:30.376
<i>Basically, you have to forget you got any.</i>

161
00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:32.044
Are they Lancashire pigs?

162
00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:33.837
Who the fuck is talking to you, boy?

163
00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:38.176
<i>Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.</i>

164
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.886
Don't let me down.

165
00:11:41.095 --> 00:11:43.472
You don't want to let me down, do you?

166
00:11:45.642 --> 00:11:47.644
See you ringside.

167
00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:54.483
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers

168
00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:57.236
has a diamond the size of a fist.

169
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.240
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

170
00:12:01.324 --> 00:12:03.909
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

171
00:12:03.993 --> 00:12:06.745
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

172
00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:09.373
But don't you hit him either.

173
00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:12.710
Americans can't know
it was Russian.

174
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:14.629
It will come back to me.

175
00:12:16.839 --> 00:12:20.717
Boris, you're my brother,
so think like my brother.

176
00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:23.095
Get somebody else
to steal that stone!

177
00:12:23.304 --> 00:12:25.431
I don't want it getting back to me.

178
00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:28.559
And don't you have him killed, Boris.
It will raise suspicion.

179
00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:30.561
So don't use idiots for the job.

180
00:12:30.812 --> 00:12:34.440
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York,

181
00:12:34.524 --> 00:12:36.359
so move quick. Okay?

182
00:12:40.947 --> 00:12:42.406
One more thing.

183
00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:44.200
It might help.

184
00:12:44.742 --> 00:12:46.368
He loves to gamble.

185
00:12:48.329 --> 00:12:49.913
Eighty-six karats?

186
00:12:50.123 --> 00:12:52.125
<i>Brilliant cut, beautiful make.</i>

187
00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:55.378
A beautiful stone.

188
00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:56.670
<i>You're a good boy, Franky.</i>

189
00:12:56.879 --> 00:13:00.007
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

190
00:13:00.216 --> 00:13:04.716
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

191
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:06.972
-Talk to my cousin Dougie.
-Doug The Head?

192
00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:07.890
<i>Yeah, Doug.</i>

193
00:13:12.145 --> 00:13:13.855
-And Franky?
-And what?

194
00:13:13.938 --> 00:13:15.397
<i>Stay out of those casinos.</i>

195
00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.445
<i>You did a good job, bubbe.</i>

196
00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:23.739
-Don't go screwing it up, all right?
<i>-I hear you, Avi.</i>

197
00:13:24.198 --> 00:13:25.866
I'll see you, Avi.

198
00:13:29.495 --> 00:13:30.871
Eighty-six karats.

199
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.790
-Where?
-London.

200
00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:34.625
-London?
-London.

201
00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:36.836
-London?
-Yes, London.

202
00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:40.381
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea,

203
00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:43.843
bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

204
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:46.845
It ain't for me.

205
00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:49.848
<i>That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.</i>

206
00:13:49.932 --> 00:13:52.935
<i>If it's stones and it's stolen,
Doug's the man to speak to.</i>

207
00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:56.397
<i>Pretends he's Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.</i>

208
00:13:56.606 --> 00:13:58.774
<i>Even tells his family they're Jewish,</i>

209
00:13:58.858 --> 00:14:02.361
<i>but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.</i>

210
00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:05.448
<i>He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business,</i>

211
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:06.698
-Yeah?
<i>-Doug The Head?</i>

212
00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:09.202
<i>-it is good for business.</i>
-Avi!

213
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.453
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

214
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:14.415
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

215
00:14:14.624 --> 00:14:17.251
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

216
00:14:17.418 --> 00:14:19.628
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

217
00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:21.672
<i>We play by the rules.</i>

218
00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:23.256
Listen to me.

219
00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:26.802
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

220
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:30.973
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

221
00:14:36.854 --> 00:14:38.438
What are you doing here?

222
00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:40.566
It's a free country, isn't it?

223
00:14:41.275 --> 00:14:43.652
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

224
00:14:43.736 --> 00:14:45.112
So fuck off.

225
00:14:56.374 --> 00:14:59.043
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

226
00:14:59.627 --> 00:15:01.420
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

227
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:04.256
-You got to go see him.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

228
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.968
-He's a big mucker in New York.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:15:08.177 --> 00:15:10.679
I want to see you girls up in my office.

230
00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:13.390
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.
-Yeah, Dad. You told us.

231
00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:21.482
The weight is sign of reliability.

232
00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:24.318
I always go for reliability.

233
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.536
I'll take it.

234
00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:35.997
How much do you want for it?

235
00:15:36.205 --> 00:15:37.414
Nothing.

236
00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:42.252
Okay, so what do you want for it?

237
00:15:42.462 --> 00:15:44.088
I want you to do something for me.

238
00:15:46.132 --> 00:15:48.008
There is a fight in couple of days.

239
00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:50.803
What kind of a fight?

240
00:15:51.012 --> 00:15:52.722
Unlicensed boxing.

241
00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:57.100
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

242
00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:01.897
If you place one down for me,

243
00:16:02.523 --> 00:16:04.024
we will call it quits.

244
00:16:04.192 --> 00:16:06.569
-Why don't you put it down yourself?
-Well...

245
00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:12.241
there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

246
00:16:13.034 --> 00:16:16.620
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

247
00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:21.416
I know something most don't.

248
00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.753
So, <i>nu?</i>

249
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:26.464
What do you know?

250
00:16:31.093 --> 00:16:33.970
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

251
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.224
-Ten points.
-What are we doing here?

252
00:16:38.017 --> 00:16:41.311
-We're buying a caravan.
-Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

253
00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:44.232
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

254
00:16:44.398 --> 00:16:45.524
Not if you're here.

255
00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:47.568
Oh, you bastard.

256
00:16:47.777 --> 00:16:50.070
I fucking hate pikeys.

257
00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:54.825
That's a flash car, mister.

258
00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:56.493
Not as flash as your bike.

259
00:16:56.744 --> 00:16:58.662
Who are you looking for?

260
00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:00.205
Mr. O'Neil.

261
00:17:00.915 --> 00:17:03.125
-Want me to get him?
-That's a good lad.

262
00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.127
Piss off.

263
00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:08.672
-Are you going to go get him for me?
-Yeah.

264
00:17:09.632 --> 00:17:12.718
-What are you waiting for?
-The five quid you'll pay me.

265
00:17:12.927 --> 00:17:14.553
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

266
00:17:14.762 --> 00:17:17.139
-Two fifty.
-You can have a quid.

267
00:17:17.348 --> 00:17:18.974
You're a real tight fucker.

268
00:17:19.141 --> 00:17:21.059
<i>There was a problem
with pikeys or gypsies.</i>

269
00:17:21.227 --> 00:17:23.187
What're you doing?
Get out of the way, man.

270
00:17:23.354 --> 00:17:25.272
<i>You really can't understand
what's being said.</i>

271
00:17:25.481 --> 00:17:27.065
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

272
00:17:27.316 --> 00:17:29.568
-Mr. O'Neil.
-Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

273
00:17:29.777 --> 00:17:31.403
<i>It's not Irish, not English.</i>

274
00:17:31.612 --> 00:17:33.864
-How are you?
-Weather's been kind.

275
00:17:34.115 --> 00:17:35.825
<i>It's just-- Well, it's just Pikey.</i>

276
00:17:36.576 --> 00:17:38.202
Would you look at the size of him?

277
00:17:38.786 --> 00:17:40.287
How big are you?

278
00:17:40.496 --> 00:17:42.456
-Kids, how big is he?
-Big, for sure.

279
00:17:42.665 --> 00:17:45.417
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

280
00:17:46.335 --> 00:17:50.835
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

281
00:17:51.132 --> 00:17:53.717
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

282
00:17:53.926 --> 00:17:55.302
I could murder one.

283
00:17:55.511 --> 00:17:58.555
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

284
00:17:58.764 --> 00:18:00.807
Get your hands out of there.

285
00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:02.684
Cup of tea for the big fella?

286
00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:06.021
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

287
00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:08.733
You little bugger.

288
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.152
-Is the big fella not coming with us?
-He's minding the car.

289
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:16.198
-What does he think we are, thieves?
-No, nothing like that.

290
00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:19.534
-He just likes looking after cars.
-Good dags. Do you like dags?

291
00:18:20.328 --> 00:18:21.579
-Dags?
-What?

292
00:18:21.829 --> 00:18:23.497
-Yeah, dags.
-Dags. You like dags?

293
00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:25.791
Oh, dogs.

294
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.127
Sure, I like dags.

295
00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:31.172
-I like caravans more.
-You're very welcome.

296
00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:45.811
<i>Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.</i>

297
00:18:46.062 --> 00:18:48.064
<i>It's probably why they talk like that,</i>

298
00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:50.441
<i>so you can't follow what's being said.</i>

299
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.653
<i>But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked,</i>

300
00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:56.697
<i>on his return,
there will be ice cream waiting.</i>

301
00:18:56.781 --> 00:18:59.283
Good dog, good family.

302
00:18:59.492 --> 00:19:02.244
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

303
00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:05.372
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

304
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:07.791
All right, Mickey. Laters.

305
00:19:09.085 --> 00:19:10.753
I don't see what the fuss is about.

306
00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:12.754
They aren't bad fellas.

307
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.183
The deal was,
you bought it how you saw it.

308
00:19:25.393 --> 00:19:28.521
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

309
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:30.606
See that car? Use it.

310
00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:34.485
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

311
00:19:36.112 --> 00:19:37.696
Nobody brings you

312
00:19:37.905 --> 00:19:40.824
unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

313
00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:44.745
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

314
00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:47.998
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

315
00:19:48.207 --> 00:19:51.376
-You want to settle this with a fight?
-Over my dead body.

316
00:19:51.627 --> 00:19:52.961
Now, go on! Go on!

317
00:19:53.212 --> 00:19:57.174
I'll not have you fighting! You know
what happens when you fight!

318
00:19:57.758 --> 00:19:59.176
Get her to sit down.

319
00:19:59.885 --> 00:20:01.511
For fuck's sake!

320
00:20:07.643 --> 00:20:09.436
Want the money? I ain't fucked you.

321
00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:12.230
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

322
00:20:25.327 --> 00:20:27.579
So that's the kind of fight it's gonna be.

323
00:20:28.122 --> 00:20:29.998
You want to stay down.

324
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.463
You want to stay down!

325
00:20:39.592 --> 00:20:42.011
Get back down
and fucking stay down.

326
00:20:42.094 --> 00:20:44.679
I promise you,
you want to stay down.

327
00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:47.016
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

328
00:20:47.266 --> 00:20:49.268
Cheeky bastard.

329
00:20:56.275 --> 00:20:58.026
-Okay, lads.
-Get him on his feet.

330
00:20:59.487 --> 00:21:00.571
Get back down,

331
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.615
or you will not be coming up next time.

332
00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:08.037
Bollocks to you.

333
00:21:08.621 --> 00:21:10.497
This is sick. I'm out of here.

334
00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:13.250
You're not going anywhere, you thick lump.

335
00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:18.505
You stay until the job's done.

336
00:21:51.664 --> 00:21:55.250
<i>It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey</i>

337
00:21:55.417 --> 00:21:58.253
<i>was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.</i>

338
00:21:58.462 --> 00:22:01.214
<i>Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.</i>

339
00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:05.761
<i>Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.</i>

340
00:22:05.928 --> 00:22:08.680
<i>If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes,</i>

341
00:22:08.764 --> 00:22:11.183
<i>Tommy knows he'll be buried with him.</i>

342
00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:14.478
<i>Why would the gypsies want to explain</i>

343
00:22:14.562 --> 00:22:16.939
<i>why a man died in their campsite?</i>

344
00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:20.358
<i>Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.</i>

345
00:22:20.442 --> 00:22:23.445
<i>It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?</i>

346
00:22:24.446 --> 00:22:28.616
<i>Tommy, "The Tit,“ is praying.</i>

347
00:22:28.784 --> 00:22:30.118
<i>And if he isn't,</i>

348
00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:32.412
<i>he fucking should be.</i>

349
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.399
Bad Boy.

350
00:23:01.942 --> 00:23:03.652
-Sol.
-Easy.

351
00:23:03.944 --> 00:23:06.655
No, it's a moissanite.

352
00:23:06.822 --> 00:23:07.823
A what?

353
00:23:08.407 --> 00:23:11.493
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

354
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.786
It's Mickey Mouse.

355
00:23:13.662 --> 00:23:14.788
Spurious.

356
00:23:15.497 --> 00:23:16.998
Not genuine.

357
00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:19.167
And it's worth...

358
00:23:19.668 --> 00:23:20.669
fuck-all.

359
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:23.964
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

360
00:23:24.173 --> 00:23:26.008
Leave this game to me and Sol.

361
00:23:27.468 --> 00:23:28.677
Late rs .

362
00:23:32.473 --> 00:23:33.599
What is that, Vince?

363
00:23:33.807 --> 00:23:35.517
This is a dog, Sol.

364
00:23:35.768 --> 00:23:37.978
You are not bringing that thing in here.

365
00:23:38.187 --> 00:23:39.855
It's only a fucking dog.

366
00:23:40.105 --> 00:23:41.689
-Where'd you get it?
-The gyppos.

367
00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:43.024
Here.

368
00:23:44.526 --> 00:23:46.277
They threw it in with the moody gold.

369
00:23:47.363 --> 00:23:51.033
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

370
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.659
It better not be dangerous.

371
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.663
What do you think you're doing now?

372
00:23:57.122 --> 00:23:59.916
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

373
00:24:02.086 --> 00:24:03.545
Stop the dog!

374
00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:04.963
Come back here!

375
00:24:05.714 --> 00:24:07.048
All right, Boris?

376
00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:11.052
-Don't worry about the dog.
-I'm not.

377
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:13.930
What can I do for you?

378
00:24:14.848 --> 00:24:16.432
I have a job for you.

379
00:24:16.642 --> 00:24:18.393
I already have a job.

380
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:22.105
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

381
00:24:23.399 --> 00:24:24.483
Go on.

382
00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:28.028
I want you to hold up a bookies.

383
00:24:32.908 --> 00:24:34.576
From Russia with love, eh?

384
00:24:35.411 --> 00:24:37.704
I have stones to sell,

385
00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:41.041
fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks,

386
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.834
so if I am not rushing you...

387
00:24:43.544 --> 00:24:46.880
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

388
00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:50.425
I am not in Rome, Doug.

389
00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:52.385
I am in a rush.

390
00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:54.262
I got to make the bookies.

391
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.597
Bookies?

392
00:24:56.849 --> 00:24:58.934
-What are you betting on?
-Bomber Harris.

393
00:25:00.477 --> 00:25:02.103
The unlicensed boxer?

394
00:25:04.857 --> 00:25:06.859
Do you know something that I don't?

395
00:25:07.568 --> 00:25:12.030
Bubbe, I probably know a lot you don't.

396
00:25:13.615 --> 00:25:15.950
He's bad to the bone, ain't you, Tyrone?

397
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.411
Of course I am.

398
00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:21.456
Tyrone will drive for us.
He's done a rally driving course.

399
00:25:21.665 --> 00:25:22.916
Of course I have.

400
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:28.505
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

401
00:25:28.714 --> 00:25:30.257
Your seats?

402
00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:32.759
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

403
00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:34.928
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car,

404
00:25:35.012 --> 00:25:39.512
so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

405
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:42.686
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

406
00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:44.646
It went back to the gyppos.

407
00:25:44.855 --> 00:25:47.607
Shut up. And how could it find them?

408
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.111
Well, I don't know. I'm not a dog, Sol.

409
00:25:51.612 --> 00:25:52.988
Ask him.

410
00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:55.949
It's like he's a fucking homing beacon.

411
00:25:57.785 --> 00:25:59.036
Steady on the brakes.

412
00:25:59.745 --> 00:26:01.538
I thought you said he could drive, Sol.

413
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:05.626
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

414
00:26:05.834 --> 00:26:07.335
All right?

415
00:26:28.023 --> 00:26:29.149
What?

416
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.236
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

417
00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:36.322
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

418
00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:38.157
Worry about getting us a gun.

419
00:26:38.242 --> 00:26:39.451
Yeah?

420
00:26:43.247 --> 00:26:44.665
What's that?

421
00:26:45.415 --> 00:26:48.000
This is a shotgun, Sol.

422
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.046
It's a fucking anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

423
00:26:51.296 --> 00:26:55.300
-I want to raise pulses, don't I?
-You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

424
00:27:12.401 --> 00:27:15.987
That does not look like a bookies.

425
00:27:16.238 --> 00:27:20.450
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter
with that space over there?

426
00:27:20.784 --> 00:27:22.619
It's too tight.

427
00:27:23.287 --> 00:27:24.746
Too tight?

428
00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:27.874
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

429
00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:32.337
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

430
00:27:32.588 --> 00:27:34.214
Of course I am.

431
00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:48.353
A natural fucking idiot,
Tyrone, what've you done?

432
00:27:48.645 --> 00:27:50.605
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

433
00:27:50.689 --> 00:27:53.692
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

434
00:27:53.942 --> 00:27:56.361
It's all right. No, don't move it now.

435
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.239
People will see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

436
00:27:59.448 --> 00:28:00.490
I didn't see it.

437
00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:04.661
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

438
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.580
It was at a funny angle.

439
00:28:09.082 --> 00:28:10.625
It's behind you, Tyrone.

440
00:28:10.834 --> 00:28:13.294
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

441
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:16.256
Control that dog as well.

442
00:28:16.965 --> 00:28:19.300
-Get that dog off him.
-Get it off me.

443
00:28:20.844 --> 00:28:24.138
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

444
00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:29.018
Don't snatch.

445
00:28:31.271 --> 00:28:32.897
He can't swallow the whole ball.

446
00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:36.943
Yeah.

447
00:28:39.947 --> 00:28:41.490
Why the fuck

448
00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.117
did you put Gorgeous George

449
00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:46.995
into a bare-knuckle boxing match

450
00:28:47.204 --> 00:28:49.539
two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

451
00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:53.084
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

452
00:28:53.168 --> 00:28:56.838
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

453
00:28:57.965 --> 00:29:00.175
What the fuck did you expect?

454
00:29:00.259 --> 00:29:02.761
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

455
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.430
Who took the jam out of your doughnut?

456
00:29:05.681 --> 00:29:08.141
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut, Tommy.

457
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.768
You did.

458
00:29:12.771 --> 00:29:13.980
You said get a good deal.

459
00:29:14.189 --> 00:29:16.691
I fail to recognize the correlation

460
00:29:16.858 --> 00:29:20.111
between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous

461
00:29:20.279 --> 00:29:21.655
and a good deal.

462
00:29:22.155 --> 00:29:24.031
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

463
00:29:24.199 --> 00:29:26.159
That his fight won't happen?

464
00:29:26.868 --> 00:29:28.077
We replace the fighter.

465
00:29:28.287 --> 00:29:30.163
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

466
00:29:30.372 --> 00:29:32.290
And who the fuck will we replace him with?

467
00:29:32.916 --> 00:29:34.292
What about John The Gun?

468
00:29:35.502 --> 00:29:37.003
Or Mad Fist Willy?

469
00:29:37.337 --> 00:29:39.464
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you. Tommy?

470
00:29:40.048 --> 00:29:41.716
Mad Fist went mad

471
00:29:41.883 --> 00:29:44.635
and The Gun shot himself.

472
00:29:49.558 --> 00:29:50.850
Jesus.

473
00:29:54.896 --> 00:29:57.940
-What?
-Let's use the fucking pikey.

474
00:29:59.609 --> 00:30:01.736
-How much you gonna pay us?
-Ten K.

475
00:30:01.903 --> 00:30:05.281
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

476
00:30:13.498 --> 00:30:14.624
All right.

477
00:30:15.917 --> 00:30:17.835
I'll do it for a caravan.

478
00:30:19.004 --> 00:30:21.006
-A what?
-A caravan.

479
00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:24.842
-Top of the range and all that.
-It was us that wanted a caravan.

480
00:30:25.427 --> 00:30:27.512
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

481
00:30:27.763 --> 00:30:29.931
It's not for me. It's for me ma.

482
00:30:31.767 --> 00:30:32.768
Your what?

483
00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:34.185
His ma.

484
00:31:01.338 --> 00:31:03.798
<i>Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.</i>

485
00:31:03.965 --> 00:31:07.551
<i>They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.</i>

486
00:31:07.636 --> 00:31:09.137
<i>Now I'm changing fighters,</i>

487
00:31:09.846 --> 00:31:12.849
<i>and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.</i>

488
00:31:12.933 --> 00:31:15.727
<i>He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up</i>

489
00:31:15.977 --> 00:31:18.312
<i>and aim for penetration.</i>

490
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.690
<i>If I didn't have the replacement pikey,</i>

491
00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:23.234
<i>he'd want to split me in half.</i>

492
00:31:26.988 --> 00:31:29.365
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

493
00:31:37.332 --> 00:31:39.751
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

494
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.839
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

495
00:31:44.005 --> 00:31:46.590
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

496
00:31:47.551 --> 00:31:49.427
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

497
00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:52.514
We've lost Gorgeous George.

498
00:31:56.518 --> 00:31:58.520
You're gonna have to repeat that.

499
00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:01.690
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:04.066
Well, where'd you lose him?

501
00:32:04.276 --> 00:32:06.861
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

502
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.864
And it's not as if he's
in-con-fucking-spicuous, is it?

503
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:11.073
We're not backing out.

504
00:32:11.241 --> 00:32:14.202
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

505
00:32:14.369 --> 00:32:15.870
We're changing the fighter.

506
00:32:17.956 --> 00:32:20.708
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

507
00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:23.127
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

508
00:32:23.378 --> 00:32:25.713
You won't know him, but he's mustard.

509
00:32:25.881 --> 00:32:27.132
Mustard?

510
00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:30.969
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee,

511
00:32:31.052 --> 00:32:32.636
you can't change fighters.

512
00:32:32.846 --> 00:32:35.056
-You've still got your fight.
-No.

513
00:32:35.223 --> 00:32:38.476
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

514
00:32:38.685 --> 00:32:42.563
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

515
00:32:42.731 --> 00:32:44.524
You can take bets at the fight.

516
00:32:44.983 --> 00:32:47.402
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

517
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.988
Do you want to get bitten,
do you, sweetheart?

518
00:32:55.577 --> 00:32:58.037
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

519
00:32:58.538 --> 00:33:01.624
You understand me now, don't you, Turkish?

520
00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:05.420
<i>This is the one place I didn't want to be.</i>

521
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:06.921
<i>In his debt.</i>

522
00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:09.757
<i>Which now means I'm in his pocket.</i>

523
00:33:09.925 --> 00:33:12.844
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

524
00:33:13.428 --> 00:33:15.763
And I shall be under it when it breaks.

525
00:33:16.973 --> 00:33:18.265
Now, fuck off.

526
00:33:26.816 --> 00:33:29.777
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

527
00:33:29.945 --> 00:33:33.156
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

528
00:33:33.365 --> 00:33:35.992
-When later?
-He said he wanted cash.

529
00:33:36.284 --> 00:33:39.245
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

530
00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:47.212
A fight?

531
00:33:47.546 --> 00:33:51.800
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

532
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.679
-Is there gambling involved?
-It's a boxing match, Avi. A boxing match.

533
00:33:56.888 --> 00:33:59.473
-Did he have a case with him?
-Yes, he had a case.

534
00:33:59.683 --> 00:34:01.393
And this schmuck is gambling?

535
00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:06.143
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

536
00:34:06.481 --> 00:34:08.149
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

537
00:34:08.316 --> 00:34:10.484
You're plenty stupid, I'll give you that.

538
00:34:10.569 --> 00:34:13.321
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

539
00:34:13.405 --> 00:34:14.906
I have no idea.

540
00:34:15.156 --> 00:34:18.325
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

541
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:21.037
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

542
00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:23.414
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

543
00:34:23.498 --> 00:34:25.416
I'm sure he can pay.

544
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.378
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

545
00:34:29.462 --> 00:34:31.672
Do you hear that? I'm coming to London!

546
00:34:36.386 --> 00:34:39.430
-Avi!
-Shut up and sit down, you big bald fuck!

547
00:34:42.058 --> 00:34:44.268
I don't like leaving my own country,

548
00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:48.689
especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches,

549
00:34:48.898 --> 00:34:51.442
and cocktails with little straw hats.

550
00:34:52.193 --> 00:34:53.986
We've got sandy beaches.

551
00:34:54.195 --> 00:34:56.071
So who the fuck wants to see them?

552
00:34:56.281 --> 00:35:00.243
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

553
00:35:00.452 --> 00:35:02.787
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

554
00:35:03.038 --> 00:35:05.040
And we'll start at that fight.

555
00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:09.043
How am I gonna get it out?

556
00:35:09.544 --> 00:35:11.045
It will probably cough it up.

557
00:35:11.212 --> 00:35:12.546
Will he be all right?

558
00:35:12.797 --> 00:35:14.048
I hope not.

559
00:35:14.257 --> 00:35:17.510
-Are we gonna rob this bookies?
-Yes, big man.

560
00:35:17.677 --> 00:35:18.886
Why are we waiting?

561
00:35:19.054 --> 00:35:22.599
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

562
00:35:22.766 --> 00:35:23.767
And why's that?

563
00:35:23.975 --> 00:35:28.475
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

564
00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:30.606
What's in the case?

565
00:35:30.815 --> 00:35:35.110
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

566
00:35:36.821 --> 00:35:37.905
Jesus.

567
00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:41.409
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-I'm well aware of that, my son.

568
00:35:41.576 --> 00:35:43.327
That's why we're here.

569
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:46.331
Well done. This is the back way in.

570
00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:49.584
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

571
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.629
-Private night tonight, chaps.
-We know. That's why we're here.

572
00:35:54.297 --> 00:35:55.423
Tickets.

573
00:35:55.757 --> 00:35:58.092
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

574
00:35:58.301 --> 00:36:01.178
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

575
00:36:01.429 --> 00:36:04.265
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

576
00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:07.351
I'm not looking for Vegas or for legal.

577
00:36:07.435 --> 00:36:09.520
I'm looking for
Franky fucking Four Fingers.

578
00:36:09.646 --> 00:36:13.107
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

579
00:36:13.274 --> 00:36:16.193
-If there's gambling, he'll be here.
-Let's not have a fuck-up.

580
00:36:16.444 --> 00:36:17.778
You won't let us down.

581
00:36:18.029 --> 00:36:21.949
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that. Peter.

582
00:36:26.162 --> 00:36:27.913
-Is that him?
-I don't know.

583
00:36:27.997 --> 00:36:29.123
How many fingers he have?

584
00:36:29.207 --> 00:36:31.459
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

585
00:36:31.668 --> 00:36:34.462
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

586
00:36:50.645 --> 00:36:52.480
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

587
00:36:52.647 --> 00:36:55.566
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything--

588
00:37:01.197 --> 00:37:02.656
What are you doing up there?

589
00:37:02.866 --> 00:37:05.326
What does it look like I'm doing up here?

590
00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:10.372
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

591
00:37:10.665 --> 00:37:12.875
Drop the screen now.

592
00:37:16.045 --> 00:37:17.296
How you doing, Vince?

593
00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:19.924
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

594
00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:22.176
-Fill that bag.
-All bets are off.

595
00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:26.180
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

596
00:37:26.389 --> 00:37:27.598
Appreciated,

597
00:37:27.807 --> 00:37:29.725
but all bets...

598
00:37:31.227 --> 00:37:32.686
are...

599
00:37:32.896 --> 00:37:34.063
off.

600
00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:38.442
If all bets are off, there can't be
any money, can there?

601
00:37:40.153 --> 00:37:42.321
I ain't fucking buying that.

602
00:37:42.572 --> 00:37:46.033
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

603
00:37:47.035 --> 00:37:48.411
What have you got?

604
00:37:50.205 --> 00:37:51.789
Nothing, really.

605
00:37:53.833 --> 00:37:55.376
A few coins, but no notes.

606
00:37:58.213 --> 00:37:59.214
Show me your hands.

607
00:38:01.841 --> 00:38:03.050
You've got five fingers.

608
00:38:06.387 --> 00:38:07.388
Copper coins.

609
00:38:08.348 --> 00:38:11.267
What do you mean,
copper fucking coins?

610
00:38:19.984 --> 00:38:23.904
It won't open
because it's a security door.

611
00:38:24.072 --> 00:38:25.239
Hold that.

612
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.708
My leg.

613
00:38:38.419 --> 00:38:42.172
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

614
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.100
We're fucked.

615
00:38:59.232 --> 00:39:01.484
What the fuck are you two doing?

616
00:39:05.905 --> 00:39:07.031
Get us out of here.

617
00:39:13.037 --> 00:39:15.664
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

618
00:39:23.339 --> 00:39:26.133
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

619
00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:32.765
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

620
00:39:34.934 --> 00:39:36.477
In the red corner,

621
00:39:36.769 --> 00:39:39.229
we have the young and unchallenged...

622
00:39:39.439 --> 00:39:43.734
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

623
00:39:44.027 --> 00:39:45.653
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

624
00:39:46.279 --> 00:39:49.740
So give it up for the bone-crunching,

625
00:39:49.824 --> 00:39:52.117
one-punch machine gun

626
00:39:52.368 --> 00:39:54.244
Mickey!

627
00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:02.670
And in the other corner...

628
00:40:02.837 --> 00:40:04.964
Now, I know he looks like a fat fucker--

629
00:40:05.173 --> 00:40:08.092
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

630
00:40:08.301 --> 00:40:12.801
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

631
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.977
Now, try and look like a fighter.

632
00:40:18.186 --> 00:40:20.688
Let's get ready

633
00:40:20.855 --> 00:40:24.984
to rumble!

634
00:40:56.724 --> 00:41:00.269
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

635
00:41:00.478 --> 00:41:01.687
What's the fucking crack?

636
00:41:01.771 --> 00:41:04.565
-I'll make it up to you.
-I ain't happy.

637
00:41:04.649 --> 00:41:08.277
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

638
00:41:08.486 --> 00:41:11.614
Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it.

639
00:41:13.366 --> 00:41:15.493
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

640
00:41:15.702 --> 00:41:18.663
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone,

641
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.790
I don't want to know if it tastes good.

642
00:41:20.957 --> 00:41:25.457
Stop me again whilst I'm walking
and I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

643
00:41:47.442 --> 00:41:50.403
-He's here.
-Well, you explain it to him.

644
00:41:57.618 --> 00:42:00.329
-What you doing?
-The case was attached to his arm.

645
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:02.956
So why didn't you chop it off?

646
00:42:03.041 --> 00:42:05.376
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

647
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.086
But he has the case.

648
00:42:07.295 --> 00:42:09.964
Look, we-- Well, you have a problem.

649
00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:13.467
There weren't much cash at the bookies.

650
00:42:14.343 --> 00:42:15.594
Okay.

651
00:42:16.554 --> 00:42:18.472
Here is the 10 grand.

652
00:42:18.556 --> 00:42:21.767
No. Keep it. We want this.

653
00:42:21.934 --> 00:42:24.603
Well, at least half of this.

654
00:42:25.104 --> 00:42:27.648
What was in the case was mine.

655
00:42:27.857 --> 00:42:31.193
What was in the bookies was yours. Okay?

656
00:42:31.277 --> 00:42:35.322
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

657
00:42:35.406 --> 00:42:37.324
No, I'm afraid it's too late for that.

658
00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:41.037
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

659
00:42:41.287 --> 00:42:45.124
We could, by all rights, keep
the Whole fucking stone, Boris.

660
00:42:55.676 --> 00:42:56.760
Watch out!

661
00:42:58.846 --> 00:43:00.556
Drop the gun, fat boy.

662
00:43:04.393 --> 00:43:08.146
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

663
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:10.900
Give me the stone.

664
00:43:11.984 --> 00:43:14.486
-It's in the case.
-What?

665
00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:16.989
It's in the case.

666
00:43:17.073 --> 00:43:18.741
You put the stone in the case?

667
00:43:20.159 --> 00:43:21.743
Open the case and give me the stone.

668
00:43:22.995 --> 00:43:26.999
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

669
00:43:56.571 --> 00:44:00.408
Now, <i>it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.</i>

670
00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:05.116
<i>Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.</i>

671
00:44:05.872 --> 00:44:09.542
<i>I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

672
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:14.171
<i>I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.</i>

673
00:44:14.255 --> 00:44:18.425
<i>But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.</i>

674
00:44:18.634 --> 00:44:20.469
<i>Once I have that, it's--</i>

675
00:44:20.553 --> 00:44:21.762
Oink, oink.

676
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.597
Shit.

677
00:44:25.892 --> 00:44:27.727
So that's where you keep the sugar.

678
00:44:29.562 --> 00:44:32.606
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

679
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.068
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it, John?

680
00:44:36.235 --> 00:44:38.570
And we don't like hostility, do we, Errol?

681
00:44:39.447 --> 00:44:40.906
No, we don't, John.

682
00:44:52.877 --> 00:44:55.337
I just had them polished.

683
00:45:00.509 --> 00:45:02.469
Go and put the kettle on.

684
00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:09.310
-You take sugar?
-No, thank you, Turkish.

685
00:45:10.144 --> 00:45:11.979
I'm sweet enough.

686
00:45:20.696 --> 00:45:22.781
He is now your problem.

687
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.451
Okay?

688
00:45:33.417 --> 00:45:37.671
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body,

689
00:45:37.838 --> 00:45:41.132
but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

690
00:45:42.677 --> 00:45:45.680
Well, look at him.

691
00:45:52.853 --> 00:45:55.897
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

692
00:45:56.107 --> 00:45:57.483
I want to use the pikey.

693
00:45:59.026 --> 00:46:00.444
All right. Of course.

694
00:46:00.528 --> 00:46:02.905
Of course, fucking of course.

695
00:46:03.155 --> 00:46:04.990
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

696
00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:07.827
But this time,

697
00:46:08.577 --> 00:46:12.455
I do want him to go down in the fourth.

698
00:46:13.207 --> 00:46:17.419
And I do mean it, this time.

699
00:46:26.387 --> 00:46:30.682
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

700
00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:35.646
So now you can open it.

701
00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.315
He's been a busy little bastard,
that Turkish.

702
00:46:38.399 --> 00:46:40.359
I think he's got away with enough already.

703
00:46:40.443 --> 00:46:44.613
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. You shouldn't do so much of it.

704
00:46:44.697 --> 00:46:46.782
Right, that takes care
of one little piggy.

705
00:46:47.033 --> 00:46:49.869
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

706
00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:51.370
Find them today.

707
00:47:10.389 --> 00:47:12.849
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

708
00:47:13.642 --> 00:47:14.768
Tommy.

709
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:19.315
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you, Tommy? Where'd they come from?

710
00:47:19.523 --> 00:47:21.816
You're looking for my boy, are you?

711
00:47:22.026 --> 00:47:24.528
-Do you know where I can find him?
-Yeah.

712
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.782
Would you like
to share that information?

713
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:30.492
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble. You hear me?

714
00:47:31.619 --> 00:47:34.705
He's my only boy. And he's a good boy.

715
00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.874
He's coursing.

716
00:47:40.127 --> 00:47:41.920
What's coursing?

717
00:47:42.004 --> 00:47:43.171
Hare coursing.

718
00:47:44.006 --> 00:47:47.968
<i>They set two lurchers--
They're dogs, before you ask.</i>

719
00:47:48.636 --> 00:47:50.137
On a hare.

720
00:47:51.055 --> 00:47:54.141
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

721
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.018
So, what if it doesn't?

722
00:47:57.728 --> 00:48:00.981
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

723
00:48:04.777 --> 00:48:06.278
Proper fucked?

724
00:48:07.113 --> 00:48:08.531
Yeah, Tommy.

725
00:48:08.739 --> 00:48:11.116
Before "zee" Germans get there.

726
00:48:13.327 --> 00:48:15.162
Do you know these tits, Errol?

727
00:48:15.413 --> 00:48:16.831
I know a lot of tits,

728
00:48:16.997 --> 00:48:20.000
but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

729
00:48:20.251 --> 00:48:21.418
John?

730
00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:23.921
I can't help, guv.

731
00:48:28.759 --> 00:48:30.093
Tyrone.

732
00:48:30.302 --> 00:48:32.721
You silly, fat bastard.

733
00:48:34.682 --> 00:48:36.517
-Do you want to do it?
-That depends.

734
00:48:36.684 --> 00:48:37.685
On what?

735
00:48:37.852 --> 00:48:40.813
On you buying this caravan.

736
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:43.440
Not the rouge one. The rose.

737
00:48:43.983 --> 00:48:46.193
-It's not the same caravan.
-Not the same fight.

738
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.362
It's twice the size of the last one.

739
00:48:48.612 --> 00:48:51.615
Turkish, the fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

740
00:48:51.824 --> 00:48:54.827
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

741
00:48:55.035 --> 00:48:59.122
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

742
00:48:59.415 --> 00:49:02.584
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

743
00:49:05.421 --> 00:49:08.465
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

744
00:49:08.674 --> 00:49:11.009
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

745
00:49:18.976 --> 00:49:22.479
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

746
00:49:25.357 --> 00:49:26.858
Have I made myself clear?

747
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:31.280
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

748
00:49:31.572 --> 00:49:34.157
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

749
00:49:39.413 --> 00:49:41.706
Did you understand a single word
of what he just said?

750
00:49:44.543 --> 00:49:45.835
I'll tell you What.

751
00:49:47.505 --> 00:49:48.714
Fucker.

752
00:49:49.215 --> 00:49:50.799
I'll bet you for it.

753
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.342
You'll what?

754
00:49:52.551 --> 00:49:53.927
He'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:54.386 --> 00:49:57.389
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favor?

756
00:49:57.598 --> 00:49:59.099
I'll do you a favor.

757
00:49:59.308 --> 00:50:02.019
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan,

758
00:50:02.102 --> 00:50:04.354
and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

759
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:07.649
If I lose...

760
00:50:10.402 --> 00:50:12.987
fuck it, I'll do the fight for free.

761
00:50:15.324 --> 00:50:18.243
<i>The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.</i>

762
00:50:18.452 --> 00:50:20.620
<i>However, I don't really
have much of a choice.</i>

763
00:50:21.247 --> 00:50:24.500
<i>Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose,</i>

764
00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:27.961
<i>well, I don't even want
to think about losing.</i>

765
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.090
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

766
00:50:32.299 --> 00:50:34.301
What? Proper fucked?

767
00:50:36.595 --> 00:50:38.263
You got that, London?

768
00:50:38.472 --> 00:50:39.514
We're on!

769
00:51:51.712 --> 00:51:54.631
Okay! I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

770
00:51:55.215 --> 00:51:57.008
I'll tell you who robbed your bookies.

771
00:52:13.984 --> 00:52:16.361
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

772
00:52:18.364 --> 00:52:20.574
Who's proper fucked now, then?

773
00:52:22.743 --> 00:52:24.911
There's something very wrong with this.

774
00:52:24.995 --> 00:52:27.747
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

775
00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:33.170
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

776
00:52:34.171 --> 00:52:37.257
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

777
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:40.260
What? You saying I can't shoot?

778
00:52:40.469 --> 00:52:44.055
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

779
00:52:44.306 --> 00:52:46.141
I know you can't shoot.

780
00:52:46.225 --> 00:52:50.562
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers

781
00:52:50.729 --> 00:52:52.939
would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

782
00:52:53.148 --> 00:52:54.691
You saying the gun don't work?

783
00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:56.276
You tried it?

784
00:53:05.035 --> 00:53:08.121
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

785
00:53:08.539 --> 00:53:11.083
Why's he got a tea cozy on his head?

786
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:13.209
To keep his head warm.

787
00:53:13.419 --> 00:53:15.796
-What happened to him?
-He got shot in the face.

788
00:53:15.879 --> 00:53:17.547
I thought that was obvious.

789
00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:20.216
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

790
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.885
-What do you want me to do?
-Sort it out.

791
00:53:23.095 --> 00:53:25.806
-I'm not a witch doctor.
-But you are a bad boy yardie,

792
00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:29.392
and bad boy yardies should
know how to get rid of bodies.

793
00:53:29.476 --> 00:53:32.061
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

794
00:53:38.861 --> 00:53:40.195
We're in, governor.

795
00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:43.365
Goody gumdrops.

796
00:53:44.199 --> 00:53:46.492
Get us a cup of tea, would you, Errol?

797
00:53:48.454 --> 00:53:49.538
Grab hold of his legs.

798
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.665
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

799
00:54:03.051 --> 00:54:05.053
Hope this is not a bad moment.

800
00:54:10.768 --> 00:54:12.019
Do you know who I am?

801
00:54:14.521 --> 00:54:15.605
I do.

802
00:54:22.863 --> 00:54:25.448
Good. That will save me some time, then.

803
00:54:27.534 --> 00:54:29.118
Well, I don't.

804
00:54:36.794 --> 00:54:40.839
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

805
00:54:41.507 --> 00:54:43.675
Apparently, the best thing to do

806
00:54:43.759 --> 00:54:48.138
is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

807
00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:52.183
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

808
00:54:52.392 --> 00:54:55.436
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

809
00:54:55.646 --> 00:54:59.149
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover now, is it?

810
00:55:04.822 --> 00:55:08.492
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

811
00:55:09.993 --> 00:55:12.161
You gotta starve the pigs for a few days,

812
00:55:12.371 --> 00:55:15.624
then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

813
00:55:17.167 --> 00:55:20.670
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out

814
00:55:20.754 --> 00:55:22.589
for the piggies' digestion.

815
00:55:22.673 --> 00:55:25.175
You could do this afterwards, of course,

816
00:55:25.259 --> 00:55:27.719
but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

817
00:55:28.679 --> 00:55:32.015
They will go through bone like butter.

818
00:55:32.808 --> 00:55:36.686
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting,

819
00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:40.774
so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

820
00:55:41.358 --> 00:55:44.402
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds

821
00:55:44.486 --> 00:55:46.738
in about eight minutes.

822
00:55:46.947 --> 00:55:48.615
That means that a single pig

823
00:55:48.699 --> 00:55:52.536
can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh

824
00:55:52.619 --> 00:55:54.912
every minute.

825
00:55:55.122 --> 00:55:57.374
Hence the expression:

826
00:55:57.624 --> 00:56:00.293
"as greedy as a pig."

827
00:56:04.631 --> 00:56:08.968
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

828
00:56:09.052 --> 00:56:12.472
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are,

829
00:56:12.681 --> 00:56:15.642
apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

830
00:56:19.855 --> 00:56:21.815
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

831
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:29.489
"A righteous infliction of retribution

832
00:56:29.573 --> 00:56:32.784
manifested by an appropriate agent."

833
00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:38.081
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

834
00:56:39.583 --> 00:56:40.667
Me.

835
00:56:48.508 --> 00:56:49.842
Gentlemen...

836
00:57:20.958 --> 00:57:23.126
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

837
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:28.005
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

838
00:57:30.175 --> 00:57:31.384
What about Tony?

839
00:57:31.551 --> 00:57:32.843
<i>Bullet-Tooth Tony.</i>

840
00:57:33.011 --> 00:57:34.012
Who's Bullet-Tooth--?

841
00:57:34.179 --> 00:57:36.306
-Tony!
-You silly fuck.

842
00:57:36.473 --> 00:57:37.557
He's a liability.

843
00:57:37.724 --> 00:57:39.976
He'd find Moses
and the burning bush if you pay him.

844
00:57:40.185 --> 00:57:41.644
You are gonna die, Tony!

845
00:57:41.728 --> 00:57:44.731
He got shot six times,
had the bullets molded into gold.

846
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:47.734
I shoot you, you go down!

847
00:57:47.901 --> 00:57:50.612
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

848
00:57:51.822 --> 00:57:53.698
Why don't you fucking die?

849
00:57:53.865 --> 00:57:56.617
-He's the best chance you got.
-Six times?

850
00:57:58.161 --> 00:57:59.579
In one sitting.

851
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.123
You're in trouble now.

852
00:58:03.667 --> 00:58:06.002
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

853
00:58:18.557 --> 00:58:19.599
<i>Bonjour.</i>

854
00:58:23.103 --> 00:58:25.188
What's so fucking important?

855
00:58:25.272 --> 00:58:27.899
Why do you think we've got a dead man

856
00:58:27.983 --> 00:58:30.944
-missing an arm in our office?
-Talk to me, tell me.

857
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:32.946
You give us four days,

858
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:36.867
I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

859
00:58:37.034 --> 00:58:38.285
What do you think, Errol?

860
00:58:38.452 --> 00:58:41.788
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

861
00:58:41.997 --> 00:58:44.249
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

862
00:58:44.541 --> 00:58:46.543
What have I told you about thinking?

863
00:58:47.753 --> 00:58:49.921
-You got 48 hours.
-Yeah.

864
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:53.466
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

865
00:58:53.675 --> 00:58:54.967
Forty-eight hours.

866
00:58:55.052 --> 00:58:56.553
After that it's your family,

867
00:58:56.636 --> 00:58:59.180
and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

868
00:59:02.017 --> 00:59:06.104
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

869
00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:07.981
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

870
00:59:08.148 --> 00:59:11.651
Tony, there is a man I'd like you to find.

871
00:59:11.902 --> 00:59:15.572
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

872
00:59:15.655 --> 00:59:16.656
Forty thousand.

873
00:59:19.701 --> 00:59:20.910
Where was he last seen?

874
00:59:22.245 --> 00:59:23.246
At a bookies.

875
00:59:23.747 --> 00:59:25.165
Bookies?

876
00:59:27.417 --> 00:59:29.293
Pass us the blower, Susi.

877
00:59:33.298 --> 00:59:36.426
-Bookies got blagged last night.
-Blagged? Speak English.

878
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:41.010
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

879
00:59:41.348 --> 00:59:42.474
Blagged, robbed.

880
00:59:43.141 --> 00:59:45.518
We'll see a man that may know something.

881
00:59:45.602 --> 00:59:46.811
I need a gun.

882
00:59:47.854 --> 00:59:50.189
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

883
00:59:53.443 --> 00:59:55.820
I got fucking black ink all over fuck boy.

884
00:59:56.071 --> 00:59:58.156
He's stained for fucking life.

885
00:59:58.281 --> 01:00:01.117
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell--

886
01:00:01.201 --> 01:00:02.702
All right, Mullet?

887
01:00:07.624 --> 01:00:09.417
How you doing? You all right, mate?

888
01:00:10.127 --> 01:00:11.545
Nice tie.

889
01:00:11.711 --> 01:00:13.504
I heard you weren't about that much.

890
01:00:13.672 --> 01:00:16.925
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

891
01:00:17.551 --> 01:00:19.344
Unlike yours, Mullet.

892
01:00:20.053 --> 01:00:21.679
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

893
01:00:21.847 --> 01:00:25.225
-Do me a favor, Tone.
-I will do you a favor, Mullet.

894
01:00:25.308 --> 01:00:28.144
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

895
01:00:30.063 --> 01:00:33.691
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

896
01:00:37.654 --> 01:00:38.988
Comfortable, Mullet?

897
01:00:39.906 --> 01:00:42.867
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

898
01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:45.912
Now, you take all the time you want, mate.

899
01:00:45.996 --> 01:00:48.206
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

900
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:51.042
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

901
01:00:51.877 --> 01:00:55.297
-What you think I'm doing?
-Well, don't, Tone.

902
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:58.382
You been using dog shit for toothpaste?

903
01:00:58.466 --> 01:00:59.884
Slow down, Tony.

904
01:00:59.968 --> 01:01:01.844
Slow down, Tony!

905
01:01:02.095 --> 01:01:05.014
I don't think I'll slow down.
I think I'll speed up.

906
01:01:06.474 --> 01:01:08.142
Play some music if you like.

907
01:01:10.437 --> 01:01:11.813
I love this track.

908
01:01:13.064 --> 01:01:15.149
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

909
01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:17.401
Yes, Mullet?

910
01:01:17.694 --> 01:01:22.194
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawnshop in Smith Street.

911
01:01:23.074 --> 01:01:24.950
Better not be telling me porky pies.

912
01:01:25.118 --> 01:01:29.618
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

913
01:01:31.249 --> 01:01:32.708
It's very effective, Tony.

914
01:01:33.335 --> 01:01:35.670
It's not too subtle, but effective.

915
01:01:37.297 --> 01:01:38.715
Are we taking him with us?

916
01:01:48.016 --> 01:01:49.142
<i>It's the Russian.</i>

917
01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:51.311
A Russian?

918
01:01:51.394 --> 01:01:54.146
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

919
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:58.276
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

920
01:01:59.819 --> 01:02:01.445
-Give me a name.
-Yurinov.

921
01:02:01.529 --> 01:02:03.072
Boris.

922
01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:05.158
-Boris The Blade?
-Yeah.

923
01:02:05.242 --> 01:02:07.702
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

924
01:02:09.788 --> 01:02:12.248
Why do they call him The Bullet-Dodger?

925
01:02:13.166 --> 01:02:15.334
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

926
01:02:17.462 --> 01:02:20.465
<i>He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan,</i>

927
01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:22.258
<i>and you nicked all our savings.</i>

928
01:02:22.342 --> 01:02:26.804
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

929
01:02:27.722 --> 01:02:31.642
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

930
01:02:31.851 --> 01:02:34.228
-Are you taking a piss?
<i>-What can I do?</i>

931
01:02:34.437 --> 01:02:36.647
I can't make him do it, can I?

932
01:02:36.856 --> 01:02:39.400
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

933
01:02:45.073 --> 01:02:49.077
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

934
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:52.163
I want that pikey to fight.

935
01:03:17.188 --> 01:03:20.316
<i>Brick Top thought smashing up our arcade</i>

936
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.443
<i>might help me to persuade Mickey to fight.</i>

937
01:03:24.821 --> 01:03:26.614
<i>And if that wasn't enough,</i>

938
01:03:26.781 --> 01:03:28.824
<i>he thought it would be a good idea</i>

939
01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.537
<i>to burn Mickey's mum's caravan...</i>

940
01:03:33.955 --> 01:03:35.748
<i>while she was asleep in it.</i>

941
01:04:32.931 --> 01:04:35.058
Turkish, get your arse up.

942
01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.601
You lot,

943
01:04:37.268 --> 01:04:39.812
follow me and I'll fucking shoot you.

944
01:04:40.814 --> 01:04:43.733
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

945
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:47.945
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

946
01:04:48.405 --> 01:04:49.656
What?

947
01:04:49.989 --> 01:04:52.783
You want to see if I've got the minerals?

948
01:05:11.344 --> 01:05:12.720
Jesus.

949
01:05:12.887 --> 01:05:14.555
I'm sorry, Mickey.

950
01:05:15.598 --> 01:05:17.057
Did you do it?

951
01:05:22.439 --> 01:05:23.857
Then what are you sorry for?

952
01:05:25.108 --> 01:05:27.568
-What are you two doing here?
-Come back!

953
01:05:27.652 --> 01:05:30.279
-You got some tars on you.
-Fuck off, Darren.

954
01:05:31.364 --> 01:05:32.948
Fuck off!

955
01:05:39.956 --> 01:05:41.582
<i>How silly do I feel?</i>

956
01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.752
<i>His mum is still smoking next to us,</i>

957
01:05:45.253 --> 01:05:47.088
<i>and I'm asking him to fight.</i>

958
01:05:48.465 --> 01:05:51.634
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

959
01:05:52.177 --> 01:05:53.970
<i>And if he'd said no,</i>

960
01:05:54.137 --> 01:05:56.556
<i>it could've been a shite sight worse.</i>

961
01:06:02.562 --> 01:06:04.146
Russians.

962
01:06:09.569 --> 01:06:11.028
Russians.

963
01:06:11.237 --> 01:06:12.738
I should've known.

964
01:06:12.906 --> 01:06:16.868
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

965
01:06:17.076 --> 01:06:19.161
What do you know about this goyim?

966
01:06:19.746 --> 01:06:21.414
Ex-KGB cancer.

967
01:06:22.081 --> 01:06:24.374
He was a highly trained undercover agent.

968
01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:26.836
He'll be impossible to track down.

969
01:06:27.837 --> 01:06:28.879
Yeah.

970
01:06:29.088 --> 01:06:32.508
<i>There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-karat stone.</i>

971
01:06:32.717 --> 01:06:35.261
-Where's he from?
<i>-I don't know. Hard to tell.</i>

972
01:06:35.428 --> 01:06:37.054
<i>He's got a thick Russian accent.</i>

973
01:06:49.567 --> 01:06:53.654
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

974
01:06:54.739 --> 01:06:58.075
That sneaky Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

975
01:06:58.159 --> 01:07:00.494
First things first. One of us--

976
01:07:01.162 --> 01:07:05.541
Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, give us a call.

977
01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:07.752
Now.

978
01:07:13.883 --> 01:07:16.802
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

979
01:07:17.387 --> 01:07:20.598
I hate Russians. I'll take care of him.

980
01:07:20.765 --> 01:07:22.475
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

981
01:07:23.476 --> 01:07:24.810
Not a problem.

982
01:07:27.105 --> 01:07:28.773
Get me to a doctor.

983
01:07:28.856 --> 01:07:31.817
Shoot that fuck! Then, get me to a doctor.

984
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:33.986
Okay, but first we get the stone.

985
01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.405
First the stone. Then a doctor.

986
01:07:36.489 --> 01:07:39.492
And not just any doctor, <i>boychik.</i>
A nice Jewish doctor.

987
01:07:39.742 --> 01:07:41.827
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

988
01:07:45.957 --> 01:07:48.584
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

989
01:07:48.668 --> 01:07:52.672
-I think you got something to tell us.
-Take it easy, Rosebud.

990
01:07:53.464 --> 01:07:55.757
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

991
01:07:55.967 --> 01:07:58.386
What the fuck do you mean replicas?

992
01:07:58.595 --> 01:08:02.265
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

993
01:08:02.348 --> 01:08:04.933
I've got extra loud blanks, just in case.

994
01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:08.395
In case we have to deafen them to death?

995
01:08:14.444 --> 01:08:16.779
-Yeah.
-Boris is here.

996
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:20.116
-We're coming over. Hold him there.
<i>-Hold on!</i>

997
01:08:20.366 --> 01:08:21.450
He's not on his own!

998
01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:28.916
We're off.

999
01:08:33.504 --> 01:08:35.881
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1000
01:08:44.474 --> 01:08:46.767
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1001
01:08:50.772 --> 01:08:51.814
So, where is he?

1002
01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:54.734
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1003
01:08:54.901 --> 01:08:57.945
-They looked Boris in the car.
-Why didn't you tell us that?

1004
01:08:59.572 --> 01:09:00.739
Did they look hard?

1005
01:09:00.907 --> 01:09:02.241
They looked messy.

1006
01:09:02.408 --> 01:09:05.244
-Let's get out of here.
-What about the Russian?

1007
01:09:05.495 --> 01:09:07.205
I want you to bury him.

1008
01:09:07.872 --> 01:09:08.914
All right.

1009
01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:12.835
I think we should get you a new gun.

1010
01:09:12.919 --> 01:09:14.754
But this time, try it.

1011
01:09:14.837 --> 01:09:17.214
How far to the Russian's?

1012
01:09:17.298 --> 01:09:19.008
Be there in a minute.

1013
01:09:24.889 --> 01:09:27.391
-Come on, then.
-No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1014
01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.561
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1015
01:09:32.230 --> 01:09:34.732
You shouldn't drink that stuff, anyway.

1016
01:09:34.816 --> 01:09:36.567
Why? What's wrong with it?

1017
01:09:36.651 --> 01:09:39.737
-It's not in sync with evolution.
-Shut up.

1018
01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:41.364
How do we get rid of him?

1019
01:09:41.572 --> 01:09:44.032
-Do you want to shoot him?
-It's a little noisy.

1020
01:09:44.242 --> 01:09:47.286
-Do you want to stab him?
-That's a little cold-blooded.

1021
01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:50.956
-Do you want to kill him or not?
-I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1022
01:09:51.165 --> 01:09:52.583
Yeah, that's the spirit.

1023
01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:54.293
Do they fire?

1024
01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.794
Of course they fire.

1025
01:09:55.962 --> 01:09:58.214
But how do you know? They're replicas.

1026
01:09:58.381 --> 01:10:00.299
What do you know about replicas?

1027
01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.681
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1028
01:10:06.848 --> 01:10:09.100
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1029
01:10:09.267 --> 01:10:13.767
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1030
01:10:14.397 --> 01:10:16.982
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1031
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:20.903
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1032
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:24.490
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8,000 years.

1033
01:10:24.699 --> 01:10:27.201
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1034
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:31.372
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1035
01:10:31.581 --> 01:10:34.667
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1036
01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:36.418
Let me do you a favor.

1037
01:10:43.092 --> 01:10:44.593
You. Want a knife?

1038
01:10:44.802 --> 01:10:46.970
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1039
01:10:47.221 --> 01:10:49.389
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1040
01:10:49.599 --> 01:10:51.684
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1041
01:10:51.768 --> 01:10:55.480
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1042
01:11:17.835 --> 01:11:19.002
Is that Boris?

1043
01:11:36.813 --> 01:11:39.148
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1044
01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.401
What about Rosebud?

1045
01:11:42.568 --> 01:11:45.404
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1046
01:11:46.781 --> 01:11:48.240
But which bit would you like?

1047
01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:53.829
They're getting out.

1048
01:11:54.872 --> 01:11:57.040
Get down and follow them.

1049
01:11:57.291 --> 01:11:59.293
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1050
01:11:59.377 --> 01:12:00.878
You're making a scene.

1051
01:12:00.962 --> 01:12:03.714
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1052
01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:07.051
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1053
01:12:07.218 --> 01:12:08.928
Well, I can't leave him in here, can I?

1054
01:12:16.018 --> 01:12:18.020
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1055
01:12:19.564 --> 01:12:23.568
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1056
01:12:23.776 --> 01:12:27.529
-He's left the door open.
-Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1057
01:12:27.738 --> 01:12:29.197
Should we go in?

1058
01:12:29.407 --> 01:12:32.868
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1059
01:12:33.119 --> 01:12:37.164
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1060
01:12:37.248 --> 01:12:39.917
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1061
01:12:41.127 --> 01:12:43.963
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1062
01:12:44.046 --> 01:12:47.466
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1063
01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:51.845
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1064
01:12:52.555 --> 01:12:56.225
Well, come on then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1065
01:12:56.434 --> 01:12:58.727
You just tell him who's in charge.

1066
01:13:04.692 --> 01:13:05.943
Boris--

1067
01:13:10.948 --> 01:13:12.449
You certainly told him.

1068
01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:21.500
The Drowning Trout.

1069
01:13:23.377 --> 01:13:26.254
Come and pick us up. And Doug...

1070
01:13:27.048 --> 01:13:28.382
sharpish.

1071
01:13:49.195 --> 01:13:51.989
I don't want a fuss and I don't want
to put a bullet in your face,

1072
01:13:52.073 --> 01:13:55.951
but unless you give me what
I want, there will be fucking murders.

1073
01:13:58.704 --> 01:13:59.705
What's your name?

1074
01:14:00.581 --> 01:14:01.582
Shoot him.

1075
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:12.634
Let go of the gun!

1076
01:14:18.474 --> 01:14:21.894
So, you're obviously the big dick,

1077
01:14:22.687 --> 01:14:25.523
and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1078
01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:28.150
There are two types of balls.

1079
01:14:29.402 --> 01:14:33.364
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1080
01:14:33.572 --> 01:14:36.074
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1081
01:14:36.659 --> 01:14:38.911
Dicks have drive and clarity of vision,

1082
01:14:40.079 --> 01:14:41.663
but they're not clever.

1083
01:14:42.123 --> 01:14:45.251
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1084
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:49.421
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy

1085
01:14:49.714 --> 01:14:52.341
and have brought your
two little faggot balls along

1086
01:14:52.425 --> 01:14:56.679
for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1087
01:14:58.347 --> 01:15:00.015
There's no pussy here.

1088
01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:03.769
Just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1089
01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:06.855
Like a prick...

1090
01:15:07.815 --> 01:15:09.399
you're having second thoughts.

1091
01:15:10.192 --> 01:15:11.651
You're shrinking.

1092
01:15:13.112 --> 01:15:15.405
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1093
01:15:16.949 --> 01:15:20.410
The fact that you've got "replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1094
01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:30.083
and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle .50"

1095
01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:34.591
written on the side of mine...

1096
01:15:39.388 --> 01:15:41.264
should precipitate...

1097
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.936
your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1098
01:15:48.397 --> 01:15:49.648
Now...

1099
01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:53.818
fuck off.

1100
01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:10.669
Look the door.

1101
01:16:10.961 --> 01:16:12.045
Look it!

1102
01:16:18.135 --> 01:16:19.427
Give me the case.

1103
01:16:20.221 --> 01:16:21.805
Fuck you.

1104
01:16:22.807 --> 01:16:23.808
Shoot me.

1105
01:16:24.016 --> 01:16:26.268
I will. I'll shoot you.

1106
01:16:36.403 --> 01:16:39.364
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1107
01:16:40.282 --> 01:16:41.825
You know what?

1108
01:16:42.034 --> 01:16:43.160
Fuck you too.

1109
01:16:43.327 --> 01:16:47.039
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be
doing me a favor, you Russian fuck.

1110
01:16:47.248 --> 01:16:49.333
You! Drop guns.

1111
01:16:50.918 --> 01:16:53.754
Fuck you! You drop your gun!

1112
01:16:55.047 --> 01:16:56.381
Okay.

1113
01:16:57.299 --> 01:16:58.466
Avi...

1114
01:16:58.634 --> 01:16:59.801
pull your socks up!

1115
01:17:12.982 --> 01:17:16.026
-Tyrone?
-Fuck it. We're out of here.

1116
01:17:17.736 --> 01:17:19.112
Give me case.

1117
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.252
Avi...

1118
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:36.505
-where's the case?
-Put the gun away.

1119
01:17:37.965 --> 01:17:39.758
What's Boris doing here?

1120
01:17:40.759 --> 01:17:42.844
Boris, what are you doing here?

1121
01:17:43.053 --> 01:17:44.637
Fuck you!

1122
01:17:53.647 --> 01:17:55.065
Where's the case?

1123
01:17:56.483 --> 01:17:59.152
-You piece of crap.
-Don't take the piss, Boris.

1124
01:17:59.236 --> 01:18:00.737
I'll show you.

1125
01:18:05.075 --> 01:18:06.242
Fuck you!

1126
01:18:10.372 --> 01:18:12.499
Almost had it.

1127
01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:14.543
For fuck's sake.

1128
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:20.882
Fuck you and all.

1129
01:18:22.384 --> 01:18:24.677
You lucky bastard.

1130
01:18:30.976 --> 01:18:33.103
Jeez, it's flawless.

1131
01:18:34.063 --> 01:18:36.857
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1132
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:38.316
Leave the dog here.

1133
01:18:38.525 --> 01:18:43.025
-Sol, why don't we just leave?
-Because life's too short, Vincent,

1134
01:18:43.656 --> 01:18:46.492
and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1135
01:18:46.742 --> 01:18:49.995
-Now leave that dog here.
-I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1136
01:18:50.162 --> 01:18:51.329
Don't worry about it!

1137
01:18:51.497 --> 01:18:55.209
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1138
01:18:57.002 --> 01:18:58.086
It's okay.

1139
01:18:58.837 --> 01:19:00.672
Sit down. Down.

1140
01:19:05.678 --> 01:19:08.722
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1141
01:19:08.973 --> 01:19:10.766
Well, we won't if you don't.

1142
01:19:12.017 --> 01:19:14.269
All right, you give me the stone

1143
01:19:14.353 --> 01:19:17.439
and I will give it to Brick Top. Yeah?

1144
01:19:18.357 --> 01:19:21.860
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1145
01:19:26.407 --> 01:19:27.699
Why is it down there?

1146
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:31.036
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1147
01:19:32.037 --> 01:19:33.788
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1148
01:19:33.956 --> 01:19:37.876
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols

1149
01:19:38.043 --> 01:19:41.129
sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1150
01:19:44.508 --> 01:19:48.512
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle .50.

1151
01:19:48.721 --> 01:19:51.223
What have they got to do
with anything?

1152
01:19:51.432 --> 01:19:53.434
They're both staring straight at me.

1153
01:19:56.729 --> 01:20:01.066
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1154
01:20:01.233 --> 01:20:02.567
Now, out of the car.

1155
01:20:02.735 --> 01:20:05.070
And leave your water pistols behind.

1156
01:20:05.904 --> 01:20:09.616
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1157
01:20:09.908 --> 01:20:11.409
I'll think of something.

1158
01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.332
Why's he sweating?

1159
01:20:19.543 --> 01:20:20.585
Oh, never mind.

1160
01:20:20.794 --> 01:20:23.546
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1161
01:20:23.714 --> 01:20:27.884
-I'm a little worried, actually, Turkish.
-Worried about what?

1162
01:20:28.427 --> 01:20:32.305
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1163
01:20:32.389 --> 01:20:34.599
I mean, he's done it before, hasn't he?

1164
01:20:34.767 --> 01:20:38.896
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1165
01:20:39.646 --> 01:20:43.566
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1166
01:20:45.277 --> 01:20:49.364
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1167
01:20:49.448 --> 01:20:51.908
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1168
01:20:52.117 --> 01:20:55.537
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1169
01:20:58.457 --> 01:21:01.460
<i>You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.</i>

1170
01:21:01.627 --> 01:21:05.130
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1171
01:21:05.297 --> 01:21:08.466
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1172
01:21:08.634 --> 01:21:11.428
<i>What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?</i>

1173
01:21:11.637 --> 01:21:13.889
We get murdered before
we leave the building,

1174
01:21:14.098 --> 01:21:17.309
and I imagine we get fed to the pigs.

1175
01:21:19.478 --> 01:21:21.480
So why are you so calm?

1176
01:21:22.439 --> 01:21:24.816
-I said--
-I heard what you said, Tommy!

1177
01:21:25.442 --> 01:21:28.278
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1178
01:21:28.445 --> 01:21:31.448
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy,

1179
01:21:31.698 --> 01:21:35.535
and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1180
01:21:37.329 --> 01:21:39.372
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1181
01:22:19.872 --> 01:22:21.540
Oh, that fucking dog!

1182
01:22:22.875 --> 01:22:24.501
Go on, get the dog.

1183
01:22:25.377 --> 01:22:27.962
-It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
-Open a window.

1184
01:22:36.847 --> 01:22:38.682
You people live like animals.

1185
01:22:39.558 --> 01:22:41.268
Now, where's the stone?

1186
01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.603
-Come on, where is it?
-It's over here.

1187
01:22:43.687 --> 01:22:47.065
-Where? Where?
-I left it in a box.

1188
01:22:52.362 --> 01:22:53.404
It's empty.

1189
01:22:53.572 --> 01:22:56.700
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1190
01:22:57.576 --> 01:22:59.744
No, I'm being serious!

1191
01:22:59.912 --> 01:23:02.581
The dog. The dog must have ate it.

1192
01:23:06.126 --> 01:23:09.587
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1193
01:23:10.839 --> 01:23:12.966
-What?
-Look in the dog.

1194
01:23:15.052 --> 01:23:18.013
-What you mean, "look in the dog"?
-I mean, open him up.

1195
01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:25.603
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, "open him up"?

1196
01:23:25.771 --> 01:23:27.814
You know what I mean.

1197
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:31.442
That's a bit strong.

1198
01:23:33.403 --> 01:23:34.529
I don't know about this.

1199
01:23:35.989 --> 01:23:37.740
No, you can't do this.

1200
01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:41.911
It's fucking squeaking!

1201
01:23:42.079 --> 01:23:44.956
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1202
01:23:48.752 --> 01:23:50.420
I'm shooting the dog!

1203
01:23:58.679 --> 01:24:00.430
Shoot the fucking dog!

1204
01:24:11.108 --> 01:24:13.944
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1205
01:24:25.872 --> 01:24:26.956
Thank God for that.

1206
01:24:37.342 --> 01:24:40.303
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1207
01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.974
Tony, come on!

1208
01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:54.901
Tony?

1209
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.999
-Anything to declare?
-Yeah. Don't go to England.

1210
01:25:12.502 --> 01:25:16.380
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1211
01:25:16.465 --> 01:25:19.050
How's the dog
gonna find the campsite?

1212
01:25:19.134 --> 01:25:21.469
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1213
01:25:21.553 --> 01:25:24.430
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1214
01:25:24.514 --> 01:25:27.016
And we have to get rid of these bodies.

1215
01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.228
That one with the tea cozy
on his head's starting to stink.

1216
01:25:30.437 --> 01:25:34.937
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1217
01:25:38.779 --> 01:25:40.113
Mickey.

1218
01:25:42.199 --> 01:25:43.366
Mickey!

1219
01:25:46.036 --> 01:25:47.620
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1220
01:25:50.707 --> 01:25:51.874
Need a drink.

1221
01:25:54.544 --> 01:25:55.962
You can't give him a drink!

1222
01:25:56.254 --> 01:25:58.256
It's not for him. It's for me.

1223
01:26:03.804 --> 01:26:05.889
Oh, mates. Amen.

1224
01:26:12.771 --> 01:26:17.271
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1225
01:26:18.276 --> 01:26:19.652
All right, Mickey?

1226
01:26:20.404 --> 01:26:21.780
Mickey!

1227
01:26:26.326 --> 01:26:28.077
Need to have a shite!

1228
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:33.621
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me,

1229
01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:35.752
shoot the bastards.

1230
01:26:38.130 --> 01:26:41.091
Well, come on. We got a fight to go to.

1231
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.349
All right, Tom.

1232
01:26:50.225 --> 01:26:54.229
-Hope we get a better show this time.
-This will make up for it.

1233
01:26:54.438 --> 01:26:57.149
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1234
01:26:57.357 --> 01:26:59.942
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1235
01:27:00.193 --> 01:27:01.736
Now, you have to forgive me.

1236
01:27:01.945 --> 01:27:04.697
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1237
01:27:07.951 --> 01:27:10.954
-Our lads at the campsite?
-They're over there now.

1238
01:27:14.166 --> 01:27:16.501
I fucking hate pikeys.

1239
01:27:18.295 --> 01:27:22.340
-How long have we gotta stay here?
-As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1240
01:27:23.383 --> 01:27:25.385
Fucking hate pikeys.

1241
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:28.513
Is he fucking stoned?

1242
01:27:29.014 --> 01:27:31.016
He's like that before a fight.

1243
01:27:31.349 --> 01:27:33.684
Do you know
when you're going down?

1244
01:27:33.852 --> 01:27:36.479
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1245
01:27:36.688 --> 01:27:40.983
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1246
01:27:41.193 --> 01:27:43.820
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1247
01:27:44.029 --> 01:27:46.740
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1248
01:27:46.823 --> 01:27:50.034
-Not now.
-Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1249
01:27:50.243 --> 01:27:53.162
Be a nice one. Hell of a way to war.

1250
01:27:53.371 --> 01:27:54.872
And they're none of yours.

1251
01:27:56.208 --> 01:28:00.045
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1252
01:28:00.253 --> 01:28:03.673
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1253
01:28:05.091 --> 01:28:07.051
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1254
01:28:13.058 --> 01:28:16.561
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1255
01:29:06.987 --> 01:29:10.365
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1256
01:29:10.448 --> 01:29:11.949
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1257
01:29:43.982 --> 01:29:47.026
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1258
01:30:29.402 --> 01:30:31.028
Talk about saved by the bell.

1259
01:30:31.571 --> 01:30:35.116
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1260
01:30:35.325 --> 01:30:37.618
<i>Do not knock him out, Mickey.</i>

1261
01:30:44.209 --> 01:30:45.960
All right, let's break it up.

1262
01:31:19.953 --> 01:31:21.412
What, is he fucking deaf?

1263
01:31:22.831 --> 01:31:24.624
What is he doing?

1264
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:41.474
Come on and sit.

1265
01:31:44.519 --> 01:31:46.521
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1266
01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:48.857
You're dancing like a fairy.

1267
01:31:49.107 --> 01:31:51.776
<i>They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.</i>

1268
01:31:52.527 --> 01:31:54.695
Get out there and hurt him.

1269
01:31:56.072 --> 01:32:00.572
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1270
01:33:21.282 --> 01:33:24.201
<i>All he's got to do is stay down.</i>

1271
01:33:28.748 --> 01:33:30.958
<i>Now we are fucked.</i>

1272
01:33:39.217 --> 01:33:40.218
He can't stand up.

1273
01:33:40.426 --> 01:33:41.427
We're out of here.

1274
01:33:41.594 --> 01:33:46.094
<i>Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns</i>

1275
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:49.060
<i>sitting outside his campsite.</i>

1276
01:33:49.269 --> 01:33:53.106
<i>Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.</i>

1277
01:33:57.068 --> 01:33:59.028
<i>Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?</i>

1278
01:33:59.237 --> 01:34:00.696
Give me that fucking shooter!

1279
01:34:00.905 --> 01:34:03.449
<i>And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.</i>

1280
01:34:03.658 --> 01:34:04.825
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1281
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.495
<i>Something very silly.</i>

1282
01:34:07.871 --> 01:34:10.748
<i>You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you</i>

1283
01:34:10.999 --> 01:34:13.584
<i>because you're too scared to think.</i>

1284
01:34:13.751 --> 01:34:16.920
<i>You just freeze and pull a stupid face.</i>

1285
01:34:17.088 --> 01:34:19.381
<i>But the pikey didn't. Why?</i>

1286
01:34:19.591 --> 01:34:22.427
<i>Because he had plans
on running the car over.</i>

1287
01:34:24.762 --> 01:34:26.930
<i>It had previously occurred to me</i>

1288
01:34:27.223 --> 01:34:30.142
<i>that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.</i>

1289
01:34:33.897 --> 01:34:36.691
<i>For every action, there is a reaction.</i>

1290
01:34:37.275 --> 01:34:38.818
<i>And a pikey reaction...</i>

1291
01:34:39.485 --> 01:34:40.861
<i>is quite a fucking thing.</i>

1292
01:35:22.862 --> 01:35:24.947
Pete, talk to me.

1293
01:35:25.156 --> 01:35:28.784
If you want your friend to hear you,
you'll have to talk louder than that.

1294
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:40.713
-Give me that fucking shooter.
-I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1295
01:35:49.305 --> 01:35:53.017
<i>That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.</i>

1296
01:35:53.935 --> 01:35:57.521
<i>That's the reason the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.</i>

1297
01:35:59.315 --> 01:36:01.025
<i>We've been tucked up...</i>

1298
01:36:02.694 --> 01:36:04.362
<i>while he's been cleaning up.</i>

1299
01:36:06.406 --> 01:36:09.033
<i>We're worse off now than when we started.</i>

1300
01:36:14.539 --> 01:36:17.041
<i>The next day we went to the campsite,</i>

1301
01:36:17.208 --> 01:36:20.377
<i>but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.</i>

1302
01:36:20.586 --> 01:36:22.588
<i>Which was probably a good thing,</i>

1303
01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.092
<i>considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.</i>

1304
01:36:27.302 --> 01:36:28.928
Where is he?

1305
01:36:29.137 --> 01:36:31.389
He ain't fucking here, that's for sure.

1306
01:36:32.098 --> 01:36:35.643
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1307
01:36:35.852 --> 01:36:39.188
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1308
01:36:41.065 --> 01:36:44.318
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1309
01:36:45.903 --> 01:36:47.738
Bollocks! Come on.

1310
01:36:52.994 --> 01:36:56.163
-What you doing here?
-What's it got to do with you?

1311
01:36:59.667 --> 01:37:01.835
So, what you doing here?

1312
01:37:09.427 --> 01:37:12.680
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1313
01:37:14.223 --> 01:37:15.265
What's in the car?

1314
01:37:15.767 --> 01:37:17.393
Seats and a steering wheel.

1315
01:37:18.227 --> 01:37:20.062
What do you know about gypsies?

1316
01:37:21.814 --> 01:37:23.816
I know they're not to be trusted.

1317
01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.612
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1318
01:37:29.405 --> 01:37:30.948
Get the dog, Tommy.

1319
01:37:33.034 --> 01:37:34.326
The dog.

1320
01:37:35.620 --> 01:37:40.120
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1321
01:37:41.125 --> 01:37:42.960
He loves that dog.

1322
01:37:43.127 --> 01:37:44.962
Always playing silly games.

1323
01:37:45.129 --> 01:37:48.632
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1324
01:37:51.219 --> 01:37:55.181
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1325
01:38:05.983 --> 01:38:07.484
Could you tell me

1326
01:38:07.652 --> 01:38:10.988
why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1327
01:38:11.656 --> 01:38:12.657
Hey, George...

1328
01:38:13.991 --> 01:38:16.201
is that a tea cozy on his head?

1329
01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:22.082
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1330
01:38:31.926 --> 01:38:34.511
<i>Tommy persuaded me to keep the dog.</i>

1331
01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.014
<i>I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.</i>

1332
01:38:38.182 --> 01:38:41.101
<i>I couldn't stand that squeaking anymore.</i>

1333
01:38:41.352 --> 01:38:44.772
<i>The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy,</i>

1334
01:38:45.022 --> 01:38:48.358
<i>and an 84-karat diamond
lodged in its stomach.</i>

1335
01:38:48.526 --> 01:38:51.403
<i>It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.</i>

1336
01:38:51.779 --> 01:38:53.781
<i>Still didn't shut it up, though.</i>

1337
01:38:54.699 --> 01:38:56.367
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

1338
01:38:56.534 --> 01:38:59.662
<i>You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.</i>

1339
01:38:59.871 --> 01:39:01.539
So, what do you think?

1340
01:39:03.166 --> 01:39:05.459
Do you know anyone Who'd be interested?

1341
01:39:10.256 --> 01:39:11.257
I might.
