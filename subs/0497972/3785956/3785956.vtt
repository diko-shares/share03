1
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.877
Who the hell's Roderick Blank?

2
00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.046
That would be me.

3
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.840
You ever see a guy
walking down the street

4
00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:47.176
looking so happy and content
you wanna find the nearest brick

5
00:02:47.258 --> 00:02:49.844
and turn his face
into hamburger meat?

6
00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:52.555
I'm sorry. That April morning,
I was that guy.

7
00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:53.847
I couldn't help it.

8
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:55.849
I had what I thought
at the time to be it all:

9
00:02:55.932 --> 00:02:58.142
excellent job,
excellent soon-to-be wife,

10
00:02:58.225 --> 00:02:59.851
excellent life.

11
00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:02.187
If only I hadn't let Trixie
open that last e-mail.

12
00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.772
What would you say if I broke out
into song right now?

13
00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:07.858
You know how this good mood thing
of yours is killing me, Rod.

14
00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:10.860
And yet... you persist.

15
00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:12.861
Stop.

16
00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.989
Stop! Or we're never gonna
get through these e-mails.

17
00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.450
Oh. Here's a beauty from Lester.

18
00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.869
"'Re: Bachelor Party Stripper Crisis."

19
00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:25.120
Have I told you how grateful I am
that I'm a lesbian?

20
00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:27.039
Delete! Delete!
My God.

21
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:29.874
Men like Lester are the reason
Death Nell was invented.

22
00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:32.877
I was a man above temptation.

23
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.337
Other woman had lost all appeal.

24
00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.713
One in particular.

25
00:03:37.797 --> 00:03:39.882
They called her Death Nell,

26
00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:42.425
even though, technically,
she hadn't killed anyone.

27
00:03:42.508 --> 00:03:44.593
Different hairstyles,
different outfits,

28
00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:47.054
different spray-painted messages.

29
00:03:50.806 --> 00:03:53.559
The same comatose result.

30
00:03:54.892 --> 00:03:57.144
It was all we could
talk about that spring.

31
00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.897
Five dates leading
to subversive seduction

32
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.899
and ending in endless slumber.

33
00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:04.316
She was the worst thing
to happen to men,

34
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.860
and the best thing
to happen to media

35
00:04:05.943 --> 00:04:08.529
in quite some time.

36
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.905
Needless to say, I had
picked the perfect moment

37
00:04:10.988 --> 00:04:12.781
to be getting out of the game.

38
00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:16.742
For every guy or gal,
there comes a time

39
00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:19.495
when you say, it’s time.

40
00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:24.374
Meet Fiona Wormwood,
my wife-to-be.

41
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:26.625
Stop staring, perv.

42
00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:29.919
It's funny, looking back.

43
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.920
She was not the sweetest girl in the world.

44
00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.380
Just, I-I like-okay.

45
00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:34.923
But when it comes to
the person you're spending

46
00:04:35.006 --> 00:04:37.925
the rest of your life with,
you want a bit of a sting.

47
00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:39.426
There.

48
00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.887
Your married friends
call you up for a barbecue.

49
00:04:44.013 --> 00:04:46.348
- They tell you...
- It's time.

50
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:47.932
Your parents tell you...

51
00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.351
Son, it's time.

52
00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:53.562
The whole damn universe tells you.

53
00:04:57.982 --> 00:04:59.692
Don't make me the villain.

54
00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:00.817
I told your sister

55
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.944
exactly how many pounds
she had to drop

56
00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:05.529
to fit into that bridesmaid's dress.

57
00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:09.408
Enough.
Let's talk about orchids. Orchids.

58
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.950
Yep. It was time.

59
00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:12.993
Okay, if you can
tear yourself back to work...

60
00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:14.953
Thank you.
I've downloaded the Big Mac.

61
00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.955
I mean The Matador!
I don't know.

62
00:05:18.038 --> 00:05:19.998
It looks like two all-beef patties,
special sauce,

63
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.959
lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame seed bun to me.

64
00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:23.959
Boss.

65
00:05:24.043 --> 00:05:25.961
Hey, that's very special sauce-

66
00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:29.422
As for the "excellent job" part of my life,

67
00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:30.965
I like to tell reporters,

68
00:05:31.048 --> 00:05:32.591
"It's always been
my dream to work

69
00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:34.259
in a fast-food restaurant."

70
00:05:34.342 --> 00:05:35.635
I was being cute.

71
00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:38.179
Our place was different.
You know... classy.

72
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.721
The plan was simple.

73
00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:41.807
Swallow up the food names,
sleek the uniforms,

74
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.183
Starbuck the decor.

75
00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:45.267
Welcome to Swallows.

76
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:46.811
One Swallow Cornucopia to go!

77
00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:50.480
Have a startling and unique day.

78
00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:51.980
You, too.

79
00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:54.900
Please, Trixie, tell me that was
the last goddamn e-mail.

80
00:05:54.982 --> 00:05:56.818
No, there's one more.

81
00:05:56.901 --> 00:05:58.277
Hold on.

82
00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.820
Doesn't say who it's from.

83
00:06:01.404 --> 00:06:02.489
I don't know.

84
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.740
I'm getting, like, a virus vibe here.

85
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.076
Okay! It's your life.

86
00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:11.078
Oh, that's weird.

87
00:06:13.163 --> 00:06:14.498
It's a list of names.

88
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.998
Must be more wedding bullshit.

89
00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, they're all women's names.

90
00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:20.961
Number one-does the name
Patricia Francini ring a bell?

91
00:06:21.044 --> 00:06:22.504
Patricia Francini?

92
00:06:22.586 --> 00:06:24.463
Whoa, I haven't heard that name in...

93
00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:27.591
Patty and I were co-captains
of my high school debate team,

94
00:06:27.674 --> 00:06:29.217
her main claim
to fame being that,

95
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.010
in classic backseat drive-in fashion,

96
00:06:31.093 --> 00:06:33.011
she took my virginity.

97
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:35.722
Clan of the Cave Bear
was the movie.

98
00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:37.140
Drive-in's now a Staples.

99
00:06:37.223 --> 00:06:38.724
What did you say this list was?

100
00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:40.475
I didn't, unless Allison Bradbury

101
00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.019
is the second girl
you ever had sex with.

102
00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.062
- Whoa.
- No way.

103
00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:48.023
Are you saying this is a list of
everyone you ever had sex with?

104
00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:49.774
Who's number three?

105
00:06:49.858 --> 00:06:51.067
Well, that would be Debbie Roberts.

106
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.317
No, wait. She was four.

107
00:06:54.694 --> 00:06:57.447
Who was the spooky
drunk girl at the 4-H fair?

108
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.158
I had to drive her home,
'cause her brother was, uh-

109
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.576
Daisy Milos Ross?

110
00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:04.034
Yes! Crazy Daisy!

111
00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:06.912
Milos-what? Ross?

112
00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:07.912
Who sent this?

113
00:07:07.996 --> 00:07:09.038
Is this some...

114
00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:10.122
pre-bachelor party trick,

115
00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:12.291
of all the girls I've loved before?

116
00:07:12.374 --> 00:07:15.461
But who would know
about Daisy Milos Ross?

117
00:07:15.543 --> 00:07:17.962
Damn, Roderick, this is
an insane amount of pussy.

118
00:07:18.044 --> 00:07:19.588
Well, thanks.

119
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.048
I don't know if I'd
call 29 women insane.

120
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.633
I guess some guys might be impressed
by the big two-nine,

121
00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:27.136
but I racked up most of those numbers
as an undergrad.

122
00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:28.887
Uh, Sparky?

123
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.098
There's more than 29 wild oats
on this list, a lot more.

124
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:35.767
Trix. T. Now, it's not like
I'm one of those silly guys

125
00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.185
that keeps track
of how many, uh-

126
00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:38.352
All right. Fine.

127
00:07:38.435 --> 00:07:40.061
Every guy is one
of those silly guys-

128
00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:42.397
Stop! The ever-delightful
Fiona Wormwood,

129
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.149
soon to be Fiona Blank,
is indeed numero 29.

130
00:07:45.232 --> 00:07:47.568
But, dude, the list keeps going.

131
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.069
Closing out at...

132
00:07:50.152 --> 00:07:51.111
a hundred and one.

133
00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:52.946
That's impossible.

134
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.823
Wait. April Fool's Day today, isn't it?

135
00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:57.241
That was yesterday.
Today's the second.

136
00:07:57.325 --> 00:07:58.826
Hmm...

137
00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.076
One of the guys.

138
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.078
Zack, Chico, Lester-
no, Lester.

139
00:08:02.161 --> 00:08:03.204
Especially Lester.

140
00:08:03.287 --> 00:08:04.789
What better way to mess with me

141
00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:06.123
than by sending me the names of

142
00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:08.124
all the women I've had sex with?

143
00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.877
Teasing me
with an obviously made-up roster.

144
00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.086
72 more tantalizing
female names to, uh-

145
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.172
Symbolize all the fine
trim you'll be sacrificing

146
00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:16.172
once you get married.

147
00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:17.799
Exactly. Yes.

148
00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:18.800
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:20.425
Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:23.178
You sure you don't have
a Carlotta Valdes shacked up somewhere?

151
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.387
I mean, according to the list,
she's next up.

152
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.891
Carlotta Valdes.

153
00:08:28.973 --> 00:08:32.685
Followed by Cynthia Rose.

154
00:08:32.768 --> 00:08:33.977
Followed by-

155
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.104
Well, whoever did this
sure put in the hours.

156
00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:37.146
Print it.

157
00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:41.066
Sayonara!

158
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:44.068
So, now you know.

159
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.737
The last goddamn e-mail.

160
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.613
The list.

161
00:08:48.696 --> 00:08:52.033
Every woman I ever,
followed by every woman I-

162
00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:54.910
You're not still staring at that list.

163
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.286
No comment.

164
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.247
Oh, did I remember to warn you

165
00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:01.889
that you're gonna be kidnapped
from work for your bachelor party?

166
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.255
Whoa!

167
00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:12.506
Hey, Roderick.
How are you doing?

168
00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:16.134
- Ready to party, Rod?
- Oh, no, no.

169
00:09:16.217 --> 00:09:18.386
No one said anything about
this going down at my house.

170
00:09:18.468 --> 00:09:19.386
- Lester.
- What?

171
00:09:19.469 --> 00:09:20.762
This is my house.

172
00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:22.472
Fiona gave us permission.

173
00:09:22.555 --> 00:09:25.099
Oh, you're insane.

174
00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:27.351
- Interesting e-mail today.
- Mmm!

175
00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.144
Worry not.
I found a new stripper.

176
00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:30.395
Oh, no. Not the stripper crisis.

177
00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:33.522
The, uh, kooky one. The list.

178
00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.315
- What list?
- The list of-

179
00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:36.649
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:36.732 --> 00:09:39.235
- Names.
- Well, our fair lady's here, gentlemen!

181
00:09:39.317 --> 00:09:40.652
Turn that up!

182
00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:42.404
Rule six.

183
00:09:42.486 --> 00:09:45.156
No ham radio operating.

184
00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:47.158
- Get it? Breasts?
- Aww...

185
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.325
No ham radio operating.

186
00:09:49.409 --> 00:09:51.870
Rule seven.
No checking the oil.

187
00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:53.829
- Checking the oil?
- Get it?

188
00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:55.164
Vagina!

189
00:09:55.246 --> 00:09:57.039
No checking the oil.

190
00:09:57.165 --> 00:10:01.043
- And I loved the touch of adding to the list
- Rule eight...

191
00:10:01.126 --> 00:10:02.886
the names of women
I've yet to have sex with.

192
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.463
- No cotton candy.
- What do you mean, man? What list?

193
00:10:05.546 --> 00:10:06.714
Oh. Yeah. "What list?"

194
00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:09.257
Hey! You two jokers
in the back!

195
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.967
Show Precious some respect!

196
00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:12.176
This is a bachelor party.

197
00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:13.886
It ain't fun and games.

198
00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:16.180
Who wants to play
musical lap dances?

199
00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:18.181
♪♪

200
00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:43.200
Aw! Too bad!

201
00:10:44.784 --> 00:10:45.701
Goodbye!

202
00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:48.287
♪♪

203
00:10:58.293 --> 00:11:01.213
Mm. You call this decadence?

204
00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:03.215
Bro, it was you!

205
00:11:03.297 --> 00:11:05.216
If only women knew.
The bachelor party.

206
00:11:05.299 --> 00:11:07.385
The best commercial for marriage.

207
00:11:08.802 --> 00:11:10.136
Cream for your coffee?

208
00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:13.305
Mm! Uh, no thanks. Carbs.

209
00:11:17.308 --> 00:11:18.226
You laughing at the old coot?

210
00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:20.185
Yeah, I'm sorry. I am.

211
00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:21.228
Hey, what about you?

212
00:11:21.311 --> 00:11:22.991
You're walking around
your own party, here,

213
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.231
obsessing about
your former conquests.

214
00:11:25.314 --> 00:11:26.690
Well, it's actually
a little more complicated.

215
00:11:26.773 --> 00:11:27.857
I was fine until this morning.

216
00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:29.567
I got this crazy list of women-

217
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:31.945
No! No! No!
I don't wanna see it.

218
00:11:32.027 --> 00:11:33.404
You don't wanna see it.

219
00:11:33.487 --> 00:11:35.656
Hell, you probably sent it
to yourself when you were drunk.

220
00:11:35.738 --> 00:11:38.157
If you're looking for a way out...

221
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.242
Rod, you'll find it.

222
00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:42.244
No, it-it's nothing like that.

223
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.661
Stop looking.

224
00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:45.204
Hang in here for another hour.

225
00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:46.747
Get married next week.
Have a kid.

226
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.270
Reinvent the tater tot! Make a lot
of money! Have another kid.

227
00:11:49.332 --> 00:11:51.751
- Say, "Thanks, Zack."
- Okay. Thanks, Zack.

228
00:11:51.834 --> 00:11:53.627
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe you're right.

229
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.296
Yo! Groom.

230
00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:58.256
Grand finale.

231
00:11:58.338 --> 00:12:00.924
Don't worry.
Lester's paid for it.

232
00:12:02.008 --> 00:12:03.135
Yikes.

233
00:12:03.217 --> 00:12:05.678
How's that for
ham radio, buddy?

234
00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:07.471
Yeah!

235
00:12:07.554 --> 00:12:09.889
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

236
00:12:09.973 --> 00:12:12.058
Give it to me, big boy!

237
00:12:12.141 --> 00:12:13.434
Oh, that's the way you like it?

238
00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:15.978
Oh, yeah! Harder!

239
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.271
This is my oldest. He's four.

240
00:12:18.353 --> 00:12:20.605
- Fuck me!
- This is your oldest?

241
00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:22.065
Wow. He's a good-looking kid.

242
00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:23.469
He's gonna break a lot of hearts.

243
00:12:23.524 --> 00:12:25.735
Yes! Yes!

244
00:12:25.818 --> 00:12:28.279
- Yes!
- Goddammit! Harder!

245
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:30.113
So are you planning on
having kids with your wife?

246
00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.196
Well, definitely. Yeah.

247
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.490
But you know, right now, we can't even
agree on what kind of dog to-

248
00:12:33.574 --> 00:12:35.242
Whoa! Precious,
I told you I don't want

249
00:12:35.324 --> 00:12:36.659
to cross the line of-

250
00:12:36.743 --> 00:12:38.286
Whoa!

251
00:12:38.368 --> 00:12:39.745
Oh, gosh.

252
00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:41.329
I'm so sorry.

253
00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:43.165
I honestly thought
you were kidding about

254
00:12:43.247 --> 00:12:45.124
all that "men can be feminists, too" stuff.

255
00:12:46.374 --> 00:12:48.168
Can you blame me for the confusion?

256
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:49.377
Well, just because I'm giving you

257
00:12:49.461 --> 00:12:50.962
a standing ovation, my darling,

258
00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:53.380
doesn't mean that we
have to, you know-I-

259
00:12:53.464 --> 00:12:55.424
- I think we better-
- Got it.

260
00:12:55.506 --> 00:12:57.300
That's what I'm talking about.
Doin' it-

261
00:12:57.383 --> 00:13:00.094
Hey, I don't want you to take
any of this personally.

262
00:13:00.177 --> 00:13:01.428
I just-you know.

263
00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.306
Goddamn, what kind
of condom is this?

264
00:13:04.388 --> 00:13:05.556
Your fiancée is lucky.

265
00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.266
She's got one of the good ones.

266
00:13:07.348 --> 00:13:09.149
I wish I was more into
successful white dudes,

267
00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:10.393
but, um-

268
00:13:10.476 --> 00:13:12.353
two broke Latin husbands, and-

269
00:13:12.436 --> 00:13:13.771
Jesus, stop me.

270
00:13:13.854 --> 00:13:16.398
Anyway, man, gracias.
Seriously.

271
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:17.815
Gracias?

272
00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:20.943
Um, Precious, your real name

273
00:13:21.026 --> 00:13:23.779
wouldn't happen to be Carlotta...

274
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:26.781
Valdes?

275
00:13:26.863 --> 00:13:28.031
How did y-

276
00:13:28.114 --> 00:13:29.908
Who told you that?

277
00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:33.078
Um, I think your bodyguard
might have mentioned it.

278
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.330
Like that asshole
knows my real name.

279
00:13:36.412 --> 00:13:39.749
So, you staying back there, or...

280
00:13:41.124 --> 00:13:42.584
Why is it so quiet in there?

281
00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:46.420
Carlotta Valdes.

282
00:13:46.503 --> 00:13:48.088
Number 30.

283
00:13:48.171 --> 00:13:51.341
This was more than
a bachelor party trick,

284
00:13:51.423 --> 00:13:54.051
more than a loyalty test.

285
00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:55.927
This was sex.

286
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.012
And I had a print-out.

287
00:13:59.554 --> 00:14:02.140
I was in the throes of
a sacrilegious epiphany,

288
00:14:02.223 --> 00:14:04.767
in possession of
a magical document

289
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.728
that promised
an embarrassment of bitches.

290
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.562
And yet, did it
void my earlier,

291
00:14:09.646 --> 00:14:12.232
rather impassioned soliloquy
about how it's time?

292
00:14:12.314 --> 00:14:14.358
To settle down?
To marry Fiona?

293
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.901
Right then, I nobly revowed

294
00:14:16.984 --> 00:14:18.695
my eternal resistance
to other women.

295
00:14:18.777 --> 00:14:20.779
Remember how freaked out you were
when you first noticed

296
00:14:20.862 --> 00:14:23.532
the centerfold was
younger than you?

297
00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:26.367
Ah, yes, the...

298
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.119
central trauma of
every American male.

299
00:14:30.452 --> 00:14:32.121
Look at this baby.

300
00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:34.373
And I mean baby.

301
00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:38.918
Born in 1984. 1984.

302
00:14:39.001 --> 00:14:41.378
My life was, like, done by '84.

303
00:14:41.461 --> 00:14:44.840
- What are her turn-ons?
- Mmm...

304
00:14:44.922 --> 00:14:47.717
Pudding, air hockey,
and pudding.

305
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:50.802
Bimbo said "pudding" twice.

306
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.638
I do like air hockey.

307
00:14:54.721 --> 00:14:57.390
"Cynthia Rose is
looking for a man

308
00:14:57.473 --> 00:15:01.394
who's confident, successful,
with a nice set of abs."

309
00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:03.895
Well, zero out of three ain't bad.

310
00:15:03.978 --> 00:15:06.022
What did you say her name was?

311
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.567
Cynthia Rose.

312
00:15:10.649 --> 00:15:11.775
Nice.

313
00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:16.363
Oh...

314
00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:17.655
Thank you.

315
00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:20.408
Dude, you're not
gonna buy the issue?

316
00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:30.081
You look like a Carl.
Can I call you Carl?

317
00:15:30.164 --> 00:15:31.832
You talking to me?

318
00:15:31.957 --> 00:15:35.419
You ever fantasize
about escaping, Carl?

319
00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:37.337
Escaping this land,

320
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.922
this magical land
of the newsstand,

321
00:15:40.005 --> 00:15:43.008
where all the girls
are right about

322
00:15:43.132 --> 00:15:46.510
to pull off their panties,
but they never quite do.

323
00:15:48.094 --> 00:15:50.430
Must be kind of frustrating.

324
00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:52.431
Look, if you don't like
the merchandise, babe,

325
00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:53.766
pssht!

326
00:15:56.184 --> 00:15:58.311
Found this on your dashboard.

327
00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:01.605
It's a unique color.

328
00:16:01.688 --> 00:16:05.025
Kinda like the one
the Parkside Peeper wears.

329
00:16:06.191 --> 00:16:08.026
Wait. Uh...

330
00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:09.944
Look, I have a disease.

331
00:16:10.027 --> 00:16:11.445
- Okay?
- Okay.

332
00:16:11.528 --> 00:16:13.447
And you could say that
I, too, am a victim,

333
00:16:13.572 --> 00:16:15.240
- because-
- Hey! No. Carl.

334
00:16:15.323 --> 00:16:17.200
Don't get me wrong.

335
00:16:17.283 --> 00:16:18.576
I think it's kinda hot.

336
00:16:20.285 --> 00:16:22.537
I mean, how would I know
you were watching

337
00:16:22.662 --> 00:16:25.706
if I wasn't watching you?

338
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.502
Wha-You've been
peeping on me peeping?

339
00:16:29.584 --> 00:16:31.378
Mm-hmm.

340
00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.629
Oh. That is hot.

341
00:16:33.754 --> 00:16:35.506
Wait, I c-

342
00:16:35.588 --> 00:16:36.788
I can't tell if you're playing

343
00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:39.425
some feminazi mindfuck game on me

344
00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:42.302
or if you're really trying to seduce me.

345
00:16:42.385 --> 00:16:47.598
Well, Carl, why don't we go back
to my hotel and find out?

346
00:16:48.848 --> 00:16:51.601
Pussy is da' bomb. No?

347
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:55.104
This is a joke, right?

348
00:16:56.771 --> 00:16:59.732
Ten seconds on
the shot clock, Kobe.

349
00:17:02.191 --> 00:17:04.527
Come on! I-

350
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.904
- This stuff only happens in the movies-
- Five-

351
00:17:06.987 --> 00:17:09.698
I'm the only one
working this shift, I-

352
00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:11.282
Get out of here.

353
00:17:11.365 --> 00:17:13.534
Are you gay?

354
00:17:13.617 --> 00:17:16.745
Are you impotent?

355
00:17:16.828 --> 00:17:19.205
Or are you just chicken?

356
00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.383
Honey?

357
00:17:35.466 --> 00:17:36.551
Sweetie, look.

358
00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:38.553
Your tuxedo.

359
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:46.767
- Rod?
- Perhaps it wasn't

360
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.977
time after all.

361
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.354
Don't worry, I didn't cancel
the wedding or anything.

362
00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.063
I'm not an asshole.

363
00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:56.108
I needed to figure things out.

364
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.443
Of course, I didn't
bring up number 31,

365
00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:00.777
Cynthia "Miss April" Rose.

366
00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:03.572
I stuck to the basics.

367
00:18:03.654 --> 00:18:06.574
"It's not you, it's me."

368
00:18:06.656 --> 00:18:08.700
"I don't want to get married
just to get married."

369
00:18:08.783 --> 00:18:12.162
I think I even threw in
a "things have been crazy at work."

370
00:18:12.244 --> 00:18:15.414
Fiona took it well... too well.

371
00:18:16.664 --> 00:18:20.168
I think my sweetie has
a little case of cold feet.

372
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.585
You're nervous.

373
00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:23.045
I'd be scared if you weren't.

374
00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:24.462
It's more than that, Fi.

375
00:18:24.545 --> 00:18:28.591
I said, I think my sweetie
has a little case of cold feet.

376
00:18:28.673 --> 00:18:29.799
You're nervous.

377
00:18:29.883 --> 00:18:31.343
I'd be scared if you weren't.

378
00:18:31.425 --> 00:18:32.593
I'm being honest.

379
00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:34.011
We're getting married
in 11 days, Roderick.

380
00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:36.596
We are past the point of honesty.

381
00:18:36.679 --> 00:18:38.598
We have a goddamn church booked.

382
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.183
Deposits...

383
00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:42.559
orchids.

384
00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:43.922
And you drop this
on me right now

385
00:18:43.976 --> 00:18:45.561
before I'm about
to get on a plane

386
00:18:45.645 --> 00:18:48.356
to go away with the girls
to a spa for the weekend,

387
00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:50.231
you goddamn son of a-

388
00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:53.734
Orchids...

389
00:18:56.694 --> 00:18:59.697
It was one thing to upheave my own life,

390
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.823
but to break the heart of another

391
00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:04.076
was too much for me.

392
00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:07.411
I told Fiona what
she needed to hear

393
00:19:07.494 --> 00:19:10.789
and provided
the requisite snuggles.

394
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:12.915
That's when I saw it.

395
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:16.626
No, not that.

396
00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:18.294
This.

397
00:19:18.377 --> 00:19:20.587
Pardon my fucking French,

398
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:23.090
but we're talking about
a fucking centerfold here.

399
00:19:23.172 --> 00:19:25.841
Fucking a fucking
centerfold, if you will.

400
00:19:25.925 --> 00:19:28.052
And believe me, I will.

401
00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:32.264
Last fling like this, I'll never have
to look at another woman again, right?

402
00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:33.514
Right?

403
00:19:47.524 --> 00:19:49.484
Back of the line, bro.

404
00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:56.739
Okay, gentlemen, don't rush.

405
00:20:00.325 --> 00:20:02.327
Get out of the way, will you?

406
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:06.584
- Don't push! Get out of my way!
- Come on, man!

407
00:20:09.416 --> 00:20:10.456
Hey, stay in line, please.

408
00:20:10.499 --> 00:20:11.750
I know how to play air hockey!

409
00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:13.210
You each get a chance.

410
00:20:27.554 --> 00:20:29.681
Fiona.

411
00:20:31.432 --> 00:20:33.058
Hey, Fi...

412
00:20:33.142 --> 00:20:34.582
you're probably
already on the plane.

413
00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:37.687
I just wanted to apologize
again for this morning.

414
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.273
I don't know what's
going through my head.

415
00:20:40.355 --> 00:20:41.857
- I just-
- Is that your car?

416
00:20:43.274 --> 00:20:45.359
Bad connection. Yeah.

417
00:20:46.776 --> 00:20:49.154
The geeks are revolting.
Like, literally.

418
00:20:49.237 --> 00:20:50.655
My name's Cynthia Rose.

419
00:20:50.738 --> 00:20:52.489
- You can call me Cyn.
- Okay.

420
00:20:56.492 --> 00:20:57.785
The guy was so serious.

421
00:20:57.869 --> 00:20:59.412
"You must be
so proud of those."

422
00:20:59.494 --> 00:21:01.496
I was like,
"Dude, they're my breasts,

423
00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.820
they're not my S.A.T. scores."

424
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.333
So, I thought if I flashed him
he'd shut up,

425
00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:07.710
but who knew the whole store
would flip out?

426
00:21:07.792 --> 00:21:08.960
I'm sorry, I forgot.

427
00:21:09.044 --> 00:21:11.205
How long did you say
you've been living on this planet?

428
00:21:13.422 --> 00:21:15.007
Coffee became cocktails,

429
00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:18.801
cocktails became dinner,
and dinner became...

430
00:21:20.177 --> 00:21:21.470
You guessed it.

431
00:21:22.762 --> 00:21:23.930
Air hockey.

432
00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:26.307
Darn it!

433
00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:27.599
I thought your centerfold

434
00:21:27.682 --> 00:21:29.309
said air hockey was your game.

435
00:21:29.392 --> 00:21:31.978
Are you always this
suave and arrogant?

436
00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:35.397
Well, it's only two
of my many adjectives.

437
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.981
I can't believe
I'm talking like this.

438
00:21:37.065 --> 00:21:39.484
I'm getting married
in less than two weeks.

439
00:21:39.566 --> 00:21:43.737
My fiancée is doing this
bachelorette spa thing this weekend-

440
00:21:43.819 --> 00:21:44.737
Wait a minute,
you're getting married?

441
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.863
Yep.

442
00:21:45.947 --> 00:21:47.740
Well, why didn't you say so?

443
00:21:47.822 --> 00:21:50.700
That changes everything!

444
00:21:50.783 --> 00:21:52.076
How would you like
to do me a favor?

445
00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:54.245
A favor?
What kind of fav-

446
00:21:55.828 --> 00:21:58.498
Don't worry.
It'll end in sex.

447
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.750
Yes, number 31, Cynthia Rose.

448
00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:04.127
You know this is the most
maniacal shit ever, right?

449
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.463
Trix, I'm sure there's some
logical explanation for all this.

450
00:22:09.214 --> 00:22:10.614
I'm not going to
wait around for it.

451
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:11.840
Keys?

452
00:22:13.592 --> 00:22:14.969
Cynthia Rose wanted to bring

453
00:22:15.051 --> 00:22:17.554
a presentable man
home to Daddy.

454
00:22:17.637 --> 00:22:21.099
The favor would last
another 24 hours.

455
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.559
Meeting another father
under the guise of boyfriend

456
00:22:23.641 --> 00:22:26.060
felt more like cheating
than the cheating.

457
00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:30.438
But as paper beats rock,
desire beats guilt.

458
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:32.439
Desire beats everything.

459
00:22:32.523 --> 00:22:34.066
I just said that I like baking,

460
00:22:34.148 --> 00:22:36.776
and the next day, the centerfold
family came up with this concept.

461
00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:38.778
It was like
a built-in kitchen set

462
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.778
with this apron that-

463
00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:41.780
Don't abuse the word "family. ”

464
00:22:41.863 --> 00:22:43.156
You know as well as I do,

465
00:22:43.239 --> 00:22:44.574
they're just making you
an accomplice

466
00:22:44.657 --> 00:22:46.242
in your own exploitation.

467
00:22:46.324 --> 00:22:47.784
Well, that's better than
not being an accomplice

468
00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:49.786
in my own exploitation.

469
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.747
You asked me what makes a man,
Roderick, and I'm going to tell you.

470
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.958
Actually, I hadn't asked.

471
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.585
But there was no stopping Victor Rose III.

472
00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:01.336
Yes, her father
was the Victor Rose,

473
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.797
entrepreneur extraordinaire.

474
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.797
Getting to have sex tonight

475
00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:06.215
was going to be more complicated

476
00:23:06.298 --> 00:23:07.382
than I could ever imagine.

477
00:23:07.465 --> 00:23:09.259
My parents believed in tradition,

478
00:23:09.342 --> 00:23:12.262
honor, dignity, faith, and free trade,

479
00:23:12.344 --> 00:23:15.639
and separate bedrooms for couples
that are not married.

480
00:23:17.348 --> 00:23:20.059
A toast to the fiery Rose family.

481
00:23:20.142 --> 00:23:21.810
May you-

482
00:23:21.894 --> 00:23:23.687
Sorry, Roderick.

483
00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.688
Every family has
a sick grandmother,

484
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.565
and Granny C just happens to be

485
00:23:27.647 --> 00:23:29.524
really old and really scary.

486
00:23:29.608 --> 00:23:31.818
Stop! Mother deserves
some respect,

487
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:33.360
not to be treated like a leper.

488
00:23:33.444 --> 00:23:36.614
Despite her grotesque skin disease.

489
00:23:40.365 --> 00:23:42.659
Dessert, Roderick?

490
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:44.827
Are you decent?

491
00:23:44.911 --> 00:23:46.913
Absolutely!

492
00:23:49.956 --> 00:23:51.666
Dessert, Roderick?

493
00:23:53.375 --> 00:23:56.253
Oh. Uh...

494
00:23:56.336 --> 00:23:58.096
You asked if I was decent.
You didn't ask if-

495
00:23:58.128 --> 00:24:01.548
Yes, my roommate in college
always used to do that gag.

496
00:24:01.632 --> 00:24:02.841
It plays better with you.

497
00:24:02.924 --> 00:24:03.841
Lots.

498
00:24:03.925 --> 00:24:06.594
Believe it or not,
you did pretty good tonight.

499
00:24:06.676 --> 00:24:07.886
Great.

500
00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:09.679
That old bear down the hall

501
00:24:09.763 --> 00:24:11.932
is going to be simply crushed
when we break up.

502
00:24:12.014 --> 00:24:14.141
You know, your father
seems pretty serious

503
00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:16.601
about the separate bedroom edict.

504
00:24:16.684 --> 00:24:20.104
The greater the danger,
the greater the thrill.

505
00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:22.272
That's what I say.

506
00:24:22.355 --> 00:24:24.065
Give me five minutes.

507
00:24:24.148 --> 00:24:26.609
I'm two doors down to the left.

508
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:29.277
Some guys have this annoying habit
of stopping to ask me

509
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:31.863
if they're boinking me too hard.

510
00:24:31.946 --> 00:24:34.573
Don't ask and don't stop.

511
00:24:35.573 --> 00:24:37.742
Foreplay's for losers.

512
00:24:39.451 --> 00:24:40.577
Hmm.

513
00:24:40.661 --> 00:24:42.704
Better make that three minutes.

514
00:24:42.787 --> 00:24:44.372
Yeah.

515
00:25:27.445 --> 00:25:29.990
Oh... yes.

516
00:25:32.867 --> 00:25:33.993
What's going on in there?

517
00:25:46.293 --> 00:25:48.503
Ooh, who died?

518
00:25:48.587 --> 00:25:51.339
It's all right, Roderick.

519
00:25:51.422 --> 00:25:53.966
Mother prayed for
this day many times.

520
00:25:54.048 --> 00:25:56.551
She's at peace now.

521
00:25:56.634 --> 00:25:58.928
She can keep my son company.

522
00:25:59.011 --> 00:26:01.096
Say hello to Vic, Jr., Mommy!

523
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.809
Cyn. Sir, I'm so sorry.

524
00:26:05.892 --> 00:26:08.019
- You must really-
- Yeah, whatever.

525
00:26:08.101 --> 00:26:10.353
She was ancient
and my brother was a jerk.

526
00:26:10.436 --> 00:26:12.354
What was with you last night?

527
00:26:12.438 --> 00:26:13.564
Why didn't you come?

528
00:26:13.647 --> 00:26:14.940
Come?

529
00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:16.357
With your father
barging in like that,

530
00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:17.762
didn't really leave a lot of time

531
00:26:17.775 --> 00:26:19.819
for either one of us
to hit the jackpot.

532
00:26:19.902 --> 00:26:21.612
You know, as they say,

533
00:26:21.695 --> 00:26:22.895
if at first you don't succeed,

534
00:26:22.904 --> 00:26:24.947
try, try again.

535
00:26:25.031 --> 00:26:25.865
What are you talking about?

536
00:26:25.948 --> 00:26:27.241
Why didn't you come to my room?

537
00:26:27.324 --> 00:26:28.450
I didn't see you at all.

538
00:26:28.533 --> 00:26:29.784
I guess it was
pretty dark, but-

539
00:26:29.868 --> 00:26:31.161
Mother had the strangest,

540
00:26:31.243 --> 00:26:33.204
sweetest, little smile on her face.

541
00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:35.289
I'm convinced that her last moments

542
00:26:35.371 --> 00:26:38.082
on this mortal coil
were ones of pleasure.

543
00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:40.959
When you said
two doors to the left,

544
00:26:41.043 --> 00:26:42.878
did you mean
your left or my left?

545
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.545
What are you talking-

546
00:26:44.629 --> 00:26:47.632
I don't know, I guess
it was my left. Why?

547
00:26:50.966 --> 00:26:53.928
Granny C happens to be
really old and...

548
00:26:54.011 --> 00:26:57.097
C. as in Cynthia,
as in Cynthia Rose,

549
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.973
as in number 31 on your list,

550
00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:02.017
as in there's more than one, dipshit!

551
00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.185
You fucked my mother!

552
00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:23.492
And if you were to put
your hand on the bun...

553
00:27:25.368 --> 00:27:27.954
I raced home to tell Fiona everything.

554
00:27:28.036 --> 00:27:29.329
Okay, not everything.

555
00:27:29.412 --> 00:27:30.705
Not anything.

556
00:27:30.788 --> 00:27:32.331
What woman, a week
before her wedding,

557
00:27:32.414 --> 00:27:34.583
wants to hear about
some crazy list of women?

558
00:27:34.666 --> 00:27:36.751
Not to mention, I mean
really not to mention,

559
00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:38.169
her future husband's involvement

560
00:27:38.252 --> 00:27:40.295
with an 88-year-old leper.

561
00:27:40.379 --> 00:27:43.006
I was sure Fiona would
take me into her arms.

562
00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:46.175
- Honey, I'm home!
- Instead, she just took.

563
00:27:46.258 --> 00:27:48.218
I never liked this couch.

564
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:49.970
Fi?

565
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.268
Fiona, what have you done?

566
00:27:58.392 --> 00:28:01.270
- Why are you-
- You're getting off easy and you know it.

567
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.982
I don't understand.
I adore you.

568
00:28:06.064 --> 00:28:07.607
I want to make you my wife.

569
00:28:07.691 --> 00:28:11.945
It's like you've got
this lost, far-away look,

570
00:28:12.027 --> 00:28:14.238
like you're thinking about
the hundreds of other women

571
00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.197
you plan to sleep with
before you die.

572
00:28:16.281 --> 00:28:18.032
Hundreds?

573
00:28:18.115 --> 00:28:19.283
70 at most.

574
00:28:19.366 --> 00:28:20.576
Keep going.

575
00:28:21.743 --> 00:28:24.913
You're the guy
who notices haircuts.

576
00:28:24.996 --> 00:28:27.915
- You never forget Valentine's Day.
- No.

577
00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:30.667
You always have the right,
supportive thing to say,

578
00:28:30.749 --> 00:28:33.085
even if you don't mean it.

579
00:28:36.087 --> 00:28:39.007
You're not some evil,
sexist jerk, Rod.

580
00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:41.884
So who are you?

581
00:28:41.967 --> 00:28:43.719
I am someone that will
love and support you-

582
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:45.344
Oh.

583
00:28:47.304 --> 00:28:49.055
It's not an oral exam.

584
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:54.602
I'm going to get up
off this couch now.

585
00:28:55.977 --> 00:28:57.937
I'm going to walk to the door.

586
00:29:00.898 --> 00:29:03.400
Do I want you to stop me?

587
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.486
Yes.

588
00:29:06.568 --> 00:29:12.491
Just as my hand is on the knob,

589
00:29:12.573 --> 00:29:15.242
I want you to tackle me

590
00:29:15.325 --> 00:29:19.996
and hold me and tell me
that you can never let me go,

591
00:29:20.078 --> 00:29:22.289
while tears stream
down both our faces.

592
00:29:23.456 --> 00:29:26.417
But you better mean it, Rod.

593
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.669
Because right now,

594
00:29:29.753 --> 00:29:30.962
you're just one
of the bigger mistakes

595
00:29:31.045 --> 00:29:32.963
I've ever made.

596
00:29:34.006 --> 00:29:36.592
But if you convince me to stay,

597
00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:42.597
and you can't back it up
with every inch of your soul,

598
00:29:42.678 --> 00:29:44.972
then you will be a true villain.

599
00:29:56.064 --> 00:29:57.774
- Good call, buddy!
- Ah!

600
00:29:57.857 --> 00:29:59.275
You made the right
decision, Mr. Blank,

601
00:29:59.358 --> 00:30:01.151
but it's not like
you had much of a choice.

602
00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:02.694
Whoo!

603
00:30:06.822 --> 00:30:08.198
Okay, what's happening?

604
00:30:09.616 --> 00:30:12.327
Where am I?

605
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:14.161
Who are you people?

606
00:30:14.244 --> 00:30:15.620
Hello, Mr. Blank.

607
00:30:15.703 --> 00:30:18.248
I'm Alpha, he's Beta,

608
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.957
and that's Fred.

609
00:30:20.082 --> 00:30:22.918
We're here to tell you
everything, Mr. Blank.

610
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.168
This isn't a dream,

611
00:30:24.252 --> 00:30:26.546
and it isn't a dream
within a dream, either.

612
00:30:26.628 --> 00:30:28.148
You're not going
to wake up at the end,

613
00:30:28.213 --> 00:30:31.007
and I'm your gardener
and these are your pool boys.

614
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.175
This is about the list, isn't it?

615
00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:35.553
Of course it's about the list!

616
00:30:35.635 --> 00:30:37.429
You must be freaking out.

617
00:30:37.512 --> 00:30:39.848
Seriously, what number
are you at right now-

618
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.265
Down, Fred.

619
00:30:43.057 --> 00:30:46.144
Mr. Blank...

620
00:30:46.226 --> 00:30:47.853
some people you don't know

621
00:30:47.936 --> 00:30:49.020
found some things you don't know

622
00:30:49.104 --> 00:30:51.273
in a place you don't know.

623
00:30:51.355 --> 00:30:54.650
And these things have been
very useful in making a new thing.

624
00:30:54.732 --> 00:30:56.776
One that apparently
knows everything.

625
00:30:57.777 --> 00:30:59.279
A thing that knows everything,

626
00:30:59.361 --> 00:31:04.658
like a computer, a supercomputer.

627
00:31:05.658 --> 00:31:08.327
I prefer the word "machine."

628
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.371
Now, this machine will take
a few lifetimes to figure out,

629
00:31:11.454 --> 00:31:14.123
and I wouldn't go as far
as to call it an oracle,

630
00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:17.709
but it is... oraclesque.

631
00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:21.337
Last week, it sent out
about 2,900 e-mails,

632
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.547
answers to questions nobody asked-

633
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:27.008
not us, not the e-mail recipients.

634
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.635
Almost everyone received nothing more
than an individual date-

635
00:31:30.718 --> 00:31:34.680
day, month, year.

636
00:31:34.763 --> 00:31:36.843
You're very lucky you didn't
get that one, Mr. Blank.

637
00:31:36.848 --> 00:31:39.768
It was the day
of the recipient's death.

638
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:42.227
But then there's you.

639
00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:44.979
Yes, a few of the e-mails

640
00:31:45.063 --> 00:31:47.190
drew an unnatural
attention to themselves.

641
00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:51.568
Well, yeah, but yours
is the best, far and away.

642
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.321
A list of everyone you're
going to have sex with?

643
00:31:55.403 --> 00:31:58.073
Oh man, this other poor dick
got the same list.

644
00:31:58.155 --> 00:31:59.323
One name!

645
00:31:59.406 --> 00:32:02.701
The wife that he lost
his virginity to.

646
00:32:02.784 --> 00:32:03.701
What a sap!

647
00:32:03.785 --> 00:32:04.827
- Fred-
- I mean, can you imagine?

648
00:32:04.911 --> 00:32:06.788
Fred!

649
00:32:08.121 --> 00:32:11.374
Mr. Blank, I think you know
where I'm going with this.

650
00:32:13.042 --> 00:32:15.127
If people were to find out
about the machine,

651
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.212
it would cause panic
and confusion and-

652
00:32:17.295 --> 00:32:18.922
You're threatening me?

653
00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:23.383
Not to be a smart-ass.

654
00:32:23.466 --> 00:32:27.220
If your little oracle is for real,

655
00:32:27.302 --> 00:32:29.054
then I can't die
before bedding down

656
00:32:29.137 --> 00:32:31.348
the last lady on the list.

657
00:32:32.765 --> 00:32:35.059
Grand to finally
meet you, Mr. Blank.

658
00:32:35.141 --> 00:32:37.102
The door is at
the end of the hall.

659
00:32:37.185 --> 00:32:39.729
Yeah, and if you
have any questions,

660
00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:41.939
drop in any time, bro.

661
00:32:43.523 --> 00:32:45.817
Can't believe
I believe all this.

662
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.486
But you do,
and we appreciate it.

663
00:32:48.568 --> 00:32:51.613
You've been guaranteed
a robust sex life, Mr. Blank.

664
00:32:51.695 --> 00:32:53.447
That should be enough for you.

665
00:32:53.531 --> 00:32:54.949
Lose the list.

666
00:32:55.031 --> 00:32:57.909
Burn it, bury it,
whatever you need to do.

667
00:32:57.992 --> 00:32:59.661
If you let the list in your life,

668
00:32:59.743 --> 00:33:03.622
it will infect
every fiber of your being.

669
00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:06.290
Bye-bye.

670
00:33:22.844 --> 00:33:25.138
I like him.

671
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:27.306
He seems sensible.

672
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:30.767
Hey, hey, uh, almighty, all-knowing guys?

673
00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:35.730
You just confirmed the validity
of a list of 101 sure things.

674
00:33:35.812 --> 00:33:40.525
Okay? So, a list like that,
doesn't get burned or buried.

675
00:33:40.607 --> 00:33:41.984
It gets used.

676
00:33:42.066 --> 00:33:46.571
And I mean, it gets, like,
crazy-montage-sequence used.

677
00:33:46.653 --> 00:33:49.281
"French-New Wave,
learning Gymkata,

678
00:33:49.364 --> 00:33:51.700
I can't believe they could afford
that song" montage.

679
00:33:51.782 --> 00:33:54.035
It's gonna be fucking nuts!

680
00:33:54.117 --> 00:33:55.368
He's just-

681
00:33:55.452 --> 00:34:00.749
He's going to fuck a lot.

But if you have to say
that stuff out loud,

741

it can't possibly be true.

742
00:37:20.522 --> 00:37:22.900
I thought I was above
all the hot chicks,

743
00:37:22.982 --> 00:37:25.568
high-five,
beer-commercial bullshit.

744
00:37:25.652 --> 00:37:28.029
I was above nothing.

745

The list was life.

746
00:37:32.073 --> 00:37:33.783
Have a startling and unique day,

747
00:37:33.866 --> 00:37:36.535
- Mr. Blank.
- Thank you.

748
00:37:38.118 --> 00:37:40.579
Wait a second,
how did you know my name?

749
00:37:40.663 --> 00:37:43.499
Swallows is the case study
in my business class.

750
00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:45.341
I thought I'd get some
first-hand experience

751
00:37:45.416 --> 00:37:47.017
and make a little money
at the same time.

752
00:37:47.042 --> 00:37:47.959
Very little money.

753
00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:50.837
That's fascinating...

754
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.338
Alexis.

755
00:37:52.421 --> 00:37:54.423
Alexis de Large.

756
00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:55.840
Wait a minute.

757
00:37:55.924 --> 00:37:57.258
How did you know my last name?

758
00:37:57.342 --> 00:37:59.386
Yeah, yeah!

759
00:37:59.468 --> 00:38:00.803
That's the way you like it.

760
00:38:00.886 --> 00:38:03.180
Well, yes, I find
the honey mustard sauce

761
00:38:03.262 --> 00:38:05.765
really brings out the flavor.

762
00:38:05.848 --> 00:38:06.933
Pull my hair.

763
00:38:07.015 --> 00:38:08.016
What?

764
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.434
Up to the window.

765
00:38:10.518 --> 00:38:15.356
Have a startling
and u-u-u-

766
00:38:15.438 --> 00:38:17.482
Is it too late
to squeeze in a cherry pie?

767
00:38:23.403 --> 00:38:24.570
April to August,

768
00:38:24.654 --> 00:38:27.657
I went from number 29
to number 62.

769
00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:30.033
Maybe I was moving too fast.

770
00:38:30.116 --> 00:38:32.368
But then, I guess
I was supposed to.

771
00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:36.205
I crossed out the names,
but remembered the faces.

772
00:38:36.287 --> 00:38:39.499
Their stare, my stare.

773
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:42.334
We think if we exchange
the meaningful stare,

774
00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:44.502
the meaning will kick in later.

775
00:38:44.585 --> 00:38:46.296
But does it?

776
00:38:46.378 --> 00:38:48.547
One or both of you
try to say something like,

777
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.257
"It's just sex."

778
00:38:50.339 --> 00:38:51.340
But is it?

779
00:38:52.842 --> 00:38:54.510
You think sending me
a bunch of roses

780
00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:56.303
is going to make me-

781
00:38:56.386 --> 00:38:58.054
You think paying my car insurance

782
00:38:58.178 --> 00:39:00.222
is going to make me forget that you cheat-

783
00:39:00.306 --> 00:39:01.724
A stuffed animal?

784
00:39:01.807 --> 00:39:04.018
I overheard a waitress say
you paid off her car ins-

785
00:39:05.435 --> 00:39:06.561
Earth to Roderick Blank!

786
00:39:06.643 --> 00:39:08.186
Stop having hot sex.

787
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.522
Get your ass up to the house
for a barbeque.

788
00:39:10.604 --> 00:39:12.481
It is my boy Max's birthday.

789
00:39:12.565 --> 00:39:14.775
Or my son Kyle. Be here!

790
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.783
When my wedding was canceled,

791
00:39:25.867 --> 00:39:29.162
there had been a chill
among the married folk.

792
00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:31.455
You'd have thought
I'd left them at the altar.

793
00:39:31.537 --> 00:39:35.666
But now they kind of
like having me around.

794
00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.961
The ladies' man.

795
00:39:43.129 --> 00:39:46.507
Lizzie is an amazing
woman, Zack.

796
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.884
I mean, what she's done with that clinic.

797
00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.218
The way she's raised
your two kids.

798
00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:52.261
Yeah, yeah, my wife's
a goddamn saint.

799
00:39:52.345 --> 00:39:54.138
Now, this stewardess,
did she say,

800
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.557
"Come on my ass"
or "Come in my ass?"

801
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:59.559
Oh, Roderick's definition
of having children

802
00:39:59.642 --> 00:40:01.560
is a little different than ours.

803
00:40:01.644 --> 00:40:03.312
Why raise them
when you can pork them?

804
00:40:03.394 --> 00:40:04.562
Ooh!

805
00:40:04.646 --> 00:40:06.406
Lizzie, how many times
do I have to tell you?

806
00:40:06.438 --> 00:40:07.981
I didn't know
she was your niece.

807
00:40:08.065 --> 00:40:12.110
Besides, she's 19- and a half.

808
00:40:12.193 --> 00:40:14.779
And I found her to be
very mature for her age.

809
00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.614
- Rod!
- So bad.

810
00:40:18.697 --> 00:40:21.200
Husbands, wives,

811
00:40:21.283 --> 00:40:23.786
kids, families.

812
00:40:23.868 --> 00:40:26.162
It was not just a world
I was supposed to want,

813
00:40:26.244 --> 00:40:28.705
it was a world
I genuinely wanted.

814
00:40:28.789 --> 00:40:30.374
What's life without experiencing

815
00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:32.458
the wonder of a child?

816
00:40:33.793 --> 00:40:36.712
- I named my hamster Dog.
- Oh.

817
00:40:36.795 --> 00:40:40.340
And when I get a dog, I'm going
to name him after you.

818
00:40:40.422 --> 00:40:43.968
Mr. Butt.

819
00:40:49.638 --> 00:40:51.348
You about ready?

820
00:40:53.224 --> 00:40:55.518
Yeah.

821
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.720
You know, maybe they're right.

822
00:40:59.728 --> 00:41:01.647
I should lower the old periscope
for a while,

823
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.148
hold out for someone special.

824
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:04.315
Special?

825
00:41:04.399 --> 00:41:06.567
If the subject is
cooking or crab grass,

826
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.318
then you can listen
to married people.

827
00:41:08.402 --> 00:41:09.736
Come on.

828
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.863
You're hitting baskets
from everywhere on the court.

829
00:41:11.946 --> 00:41:14.115
This is no time
to go back to the bench.

830
00:41:14.197 --> 00:41:15.865
Hey. I'm Bob.

831
00:41:15.949 --> 00:41:17.575
- Rod, is it?
- Yeah.

832
00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:20.787
My apologies, I just-
I couldn't help overhearing

833
00:41:20.869 --> 00:41:23.163
your good fortune with
the female of the species.

834
00:41:23.246 --> 00:41:24.622
I'm hoping it'll rub off.

835
00:41:24.706 --> 00:41:26.457
And why is that, kind sir?

836
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.750
Oh, funny story.

837
00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:30.711
One morning
about five months ago,

838
00:41:30.751 --> 00:41:33.254
I came to work, and right there
on my computer screen,

839
00:41:33.337 --> 00:41:35.506
a day, a month and a year.

840
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:38.133
A date. Today's date.

841
00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:40.676
I'm utterly convinced
that it's a sign.

842
00:41:40.759 --> 00:41:43.220
The night that
I'm to meet my soul mate.

843
00:41:43.261 --> 00:41:44.846
- You had to ask him.
- I've gone as far

844
00:41:44.929 --> 00:41:46.264
as to procure lodgings
down the street

845
00:41:46.346 --> 00:41:48.223
at the Hotel Taboo.

846
00:41:49.683 --> 00:41:51.018
Kind of spicy.

847
00:41:51.058 --> 00:41:53.519
Wait.

848
00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:56.606
You received an unexplained date
as an e-mail?

849
00:41:56.688 --> 00:41:57.814
Yeah.

850
00:41:57.856 --> 00:42:00.525
Your next drink's on me.

851
00:42:00.649 --> 00:42:03.110

The daily streaming video.

873
00:43:12.036 --> 00:43:14.830
They are the Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

874
00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:16.539
They go from town to town,

875
00:43:16.623 --> 00:43:19.251
mm, raising awareness
on important issues

876
00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:21.168
by empowering young women...

877
00:43:21.252 --> 00:43:23.003
and then seducing them.

878
00:43:23.086 --> 00:43:24.712
I'm hoping for an autograph.

879
00:43:26.505 --> 00:43:28.799

880

Oh, back off,
they're looking over here.

881
00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:35.054
My friends,
it's not about buying them flowers.

882
00:43:35.136 --> 00:43:38.515
It's not about pretending
to ignore them.

883
00:43:38.597 --> 00:43:41.892
It's all about just knowing.

884
00:43:41.976 --> 00:43:45.271
I know, easy for me to say.

885
00:43:46.436 --> 00:43:49.481

886
00:43:51.649 --> 00:43:54.360
Bambi and Thumper.

887

W- Why are they staring at you?

888
00:43:57.821 --> 00:43:59.030
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

889
00:43:59.113 --> 00:44:01.073
Don't tell me one of them
is on that fucking list.

890
00:44:01.156 --> 00:44:05.828
- That list of fucking-
- No, one of them is not on the list.

891
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.418
But you see, even before the list,

892
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:17.878
I always knew just knowing

893
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:21.673
beats any gift, tactic,
or opening line,

894
00:44:21.755 --> 00:44:23.883
no matter what
the sexual orientation.

895
00:44:23.965 --> 00:44:27.468
♪ If I can't have you ♪

896
00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:30.804
♪ One that I can love ♪

897
00:44:30.887 --> 00:44:32.763
♪ To have and to hold ♪

898
00:44:32.847 --> 00:44:33.806
♪ One for at the club ♪

899
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.726
Wish me luck.

900
00:44:36.808 --> 00:44:39.978
I may be coming in late tomorrow.

901
00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.061
Rod?

902
00:44:49.151 --> 00:44:51.528
Hey, Rod! Hey!

903
00:44:51.611 --> 00:44:53.779
Hey, I found her!

904
00:44:53.863 --> 00:44:55.114
She's the one!

905
00:44:55.197 --> 00:44:57.199
Can you-What a night!

906
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.077
What a night, indeed.

907
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.538
Hey, have you thought any more
about my offer, my love?

908
00:45:05.622 --> 00:45:07.790
I mean, yours are nice,
don't get me wrong.

909
00:45:07.873 --> 00:45:09.583
Really, really nice,

910
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:12.085
but is there really
such a thing as too big?

911
00:45:12.168 --> 00:45:16.172
- Let's just enjoy this moment.
- All right.

912
00:45:16.254 --> 00:45:18.381
Just, you know, with my position
at the company,

913
00:45:18.464 --> 00:45:20.966
I get a 40% discount on
whatever kind of implant you want.

914
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.967
Hey, Bob.

915
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.594
Seriously, enjoy the moment.

916
00:45:24.677 --> 00:45:26.512
Okay. You win.

917
00:45:28.388 --> 00:45:31.975
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

918
00:45:32.058 --> 00:45:36.020
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

919
00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:40.065
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

920
00:45:40.147 --> 00:45:43.943
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

921
00:45:45.193 --> 00:45:46.110
Drink?

922
00:45:48.195 --> 00:45:50.155
Don't mind if I do.

923
00:45:53.908 --> 00:45:56.953
Is the gentleman surprised
that he's here?

924
00:45:57.035 --> 00:45:58.245
No, the gentleman is not.

925
00:45:58.327 --> 00:46:00.704
Oh! Did you hear that,
Miss Kidd?

926
00:46:00.788 --> 00:46:02.665
He's very cocky.

927
00:46:02.747 --> 00:46:05.625
Accent on the cock, Miss Wint.

928
00:46:09.378 --> 00:46:10.963
Boy, my assistant
is gonna kill me-

929
00:46:11.045 --> 00:46:13.881
That is so sweet.
He is trying to talk to us.

930
00:46:13.965 --> 00:46:18.511
Man-guy, just sign the confidentiality
agreement on the table.

931
00:46:18.592 --> 00:46:19.510
Now.

932
00:46:19.593 --> 00:46:22.513
The kind sir does understand

933
00:46:22.595 --> 00:46:25.223
a vegan doesn't tell her friends

934
00:46:25.306 --> 00:46:28.268
that she just wolfed down
a greasy cheeseburger.

935
00:46:30.977 --> 00:46:34.188
Yes, the kind sir
understands... kind of.

936
00:46:35.355 --> 00:46:36.898
Bottoms up.

937
00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:27.686
Whoa!

938
00:47:27.769 --> 00:47:31.023
Looks like everyone's having
a good time tonight, huh?

939
00:47:31.105 --> 00:47:32.607
So what do you say
about round two?

940
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.066
I may need a little
in about 30 minutes.

941
00:47:34.149 --> 00:47:36.151
And I'd like you to meet
my family, if that's okay.

942
00:47:36.234 --> 00:47:38.111
I was thinking, I'm from, uh-

943
00:47:40.696 --> 00:47:42.615
Oh, my God!
Is that paint?

944
00:47:42.697 --> 00:47:44.240
Does that come off?

945
00:47:44.324 --> 00:47:45.450
Wh-why would you do that?

946
00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:46.993
I put this room
on my credit card.

947
00:47:47.075 --> 00:47:49.119
What are you trying to do,
imitate that disturbed woman

948
00:47:49.203 --> 00:47:50.412
who's going around...

949
00:47:52.205 --> 00:47:53.122
Oh, dear.

950
00:47:54.831 --> 00:47:56.875
What can I say, Bob?

951
00:47:56.958 --> 00:48:00.086
Some dreams are
too true to be good.

952
00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.963
Well, I must say,
you're being a real cun-

953
00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.923
uh-I didn't say it-

954
00:48:05.006 --> 00:48:07.383
cunning woman, you are.

955
00:48:07.466 --> 00:48:09.718
That's what I was-
I was g-help?

956
00:48:09.801 --> 00:48:11.803
Ow! I was faking it!

957
00:48:11.886 --> 00:48:13.679
Don't tell me you
were faking it, Miss Kidd.

958
00:48:13.763 --> 00:48:16.098
I know when you're faking it,
and you did that thing with your toes!

959
00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:19.434
- No...
- Bambi, Thumper, please, don't fight.

960
00:48:19.517 --> 00:48:21.277
You said you wouldn't
get jealous, Miss Wint!

961
00:48:23.102 --> 00:48:24.938
Okay. Maybe fight
a little more.

962
00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:28.024
This is not about sex!
This is about intimacy!

963
00:48:28.106 --> 00:48:29.233
Real intimacy!

964
00:48:29.316 --> 00:48:30.556
That's it.
Turn the cameras off.

965
00:48:30.566 --> 00:48:32.151
Keep the camera rolling!

966
00:48:32.235 --> 00:48:34.070
Cameras? Rolling?

967
00:48:34.152 --> 00:48:36.988
Oh, no, no. No, this is crazy.
You can't film this!

968
00:48:37.072 --> 00:48:39.991
Well, you did know the confidentiality
agreement's really a release form.

969
00:48:40.074 --> 00:48:41.242
Haven't you seen our show?

970
00:48:41.325 --> 00:48:44.453
Don't you change
the subject, Star Whore.

971
00:48:50.122 --> 00:48:52.333
Help me, somebody!
It's her! She's here!

972
00:48:52.416 --> 00:48:54.085
I think they're kind of having

973
00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:56.586
some problems of
their own there, Bob.

974
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.921
Please! Just tell me
what you want from me!

975
00:48:58.004 --> 00:48:59.798
Why don't you sleep on it, Bob?

976
00:49:00.714 --> 00:49:02.883
Take forever, if you have to.

977
00:49:02.966 --> 00:49:04.008
Don't. Please. Please.

978
00:49:04.092 --> 00:49:05.635
Please wait. Just wait. Wait.

979
00:49:05.718 --> 00:49:06.928
I- This is not fair.

980
00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.846
It's not like I hit you,
or roofied you,

981
00:49:08.929 --> 00:49:11.306
or openly exploited you in-

982
00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:13.683
Oh, this is the breast
implant thing? Okay.

983
00:49:13.766 --> 00:49:15.017
Look, I'm just
the company accountant.

984
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.561
I keep the books! Please!

985
00:49:17.644 --> 00:49:20.522
All I need to know is, why?
I deserve a good reason-

986
00:49:20.604 --> 00:49:22.523
Why do men always
get to have reasons?

987
00:49:22.605 --> 00:49:25.900
Did you think women get to have
reasons when they get attacked?

988
00:49:25.984 --> 00:49:28.027
I want everyone on red alert here.

989
00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:31.321
Although you do bring up
a legitimate point.

990
00:49:31.404 --> 00:49:33.322
I mean, you're not
Master Bitchslap

991
00:49:33.406 --> 00:49:35.575
or the Parkside Peeper.

992
00:49:35.657 --> 00:49:38.076
Or even that captain
of the lacrosse team, who-

993
00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:39.326
Whoap!

994
00:49:42.328 --> 00:49:43.246
Bob?

995
00:49:43.329 --> 00:49:45.623
Oh... Bob.

996
00:49:47.583 --> 00:49:50.669
Aw, pilgrim.

997
00:49:52.628 --> 00:49:54.380
Guess it was just your time.

998
00:50:01.844 --> 00:50:03.971
Oh, yeah...

999
00:50:04.053 --> 00:50:05.722
What a night.

1000
00:50:16.104 --> 00:50:18.231
What time do you have to
be down at the new location?

1001
00:50:18.314 --> 00:50:20.357
Trixie?

1002
00:50:20.441 --> 00:50:22.359
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

1003
00:50:22.442 --> 00:50:23.722
If it makes you feel any better,

1004
00:50:23.777 --> 00:50:26.321
it was the most
traumatic night of my-

1005
00:50:26.403 --> 00:50:28.155
Okay, well, it wasn't all bad, but...

1006
00:50:28.238 --> 00:50:30.879
I'm sorry. It's always been a fantasy
to be with two women at once.

1007
00:50:30.948 --> 00:50:34.577
You know, lesbians,
rock stars, astronauts.

1008
00:50:34.659 --> 00:50:35.786
Okay, maybe not astronauts.

1009
00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.455
But you know, sexy female
space travelers.

1010
00:50:38.537 --> 00:50:40.247
You're giving the finger
to the intercom box, aren't you?

1011
00:50:40.331 --> 00:50:42.625
I know. I know.

1012
00:50:42.707 --> 00:50:44.209
I lied about 'em
being on the list.

1013
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.461
The list. Damn it!

1014
00:50:46.752 --> 00:50:48.504
Don't get me wrong,
a piece of paper that tells me

1015
00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:49.948
whether or not
I'm gonna get lucky,

1016
00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:51.965
you're not gonna say
anything bad about, but...

1017
00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:54.383
it's-it's like...

1018
00:50:54.466 --> 00:50:56.218
watching a tape
of a football game,

1019
00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:57.177
and you know your team wins.

1020
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.804
It's not unenjoyable,

1021
00:50:58.886 --> 00:51:01.180
but can it really compare
to watching the game live,

1022
00:51:01.263 --> 00:51:02.807
and they're going for it
on the fourth down?

1023
00:51:02.889 --> 00:51:04.766
- And you don't know if-
- Sports metaphors...

1024
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:06.309
aren't my thing.

1025
00:51:06.391 --> 00:51:08.185
But it sounds like you're going for

1026
00:51:08.268 --> 00:51:09.311
"The thrill of the pursuit

1027
00:51:09.394 --> 00:51:11.188
is more exciting than the conquest."

1028
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.188
I can't help it!

1029
00:51:12.271 --> 00:51:13.356
I mean, I see the name,

1030
00:51:13.439 --> 00:51:15.274
I want to find her and meet her,

1031
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:18.068
so I can cross her out,
and I can get to the next name.

1032
00:51:18.901 --> 00:51:20.694
I'm not in control
of my own destiny.

1033
00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:22.113
That may be true.

1034
00:51:22.195 --> 00:51:24.030
But you're not
supposed to know that!

1035
00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:27.617
You're meddling with
the primal forces of nature.

1036
00:51:27.699 --> 00:51:31.245
I mean, my God.
Am I on the list, too?

1037
00:51:31.327 --> 00:51:33.121
I mean-

1038
00:51:38.332 --> 00:51:39.875
Ah. Whew.

1039
00:51:41.293 --> 00:51:43.254
You got scared
there a little, didn't you?

1040
00:51:43.336 --> 00:51:45.463
- Oh, you were more scared.
- Yes.

1041
00:51:46.255 --> 00:51:48.048
Trixie?

1042
00:51:48.132 --> 00:51:49.852
What if I were meant
to be with these women,

1043
00:51:49.925 --> 00:51:51.218
no matter what?

1044
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.761
What if you were meant
to bury the list,

1045
00:51:53.845 --> 00:51:55.972
and calm the heck down?

1046
00:51:56.054 --> 00:51:57.472
You know...

1047
00:51:57.556 --> 00:52:01.268
if we bury the list, guess what?

1048
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:04.186
You were meant to bury the list.

1049
00:52:04.269 --> 00:52:05.562
Live your life.

1050
00:52:05.645 --> 00:52:08.898
Whatever happens, happens.

1051
00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:13.443
You know, it's a sheet
of paper, not a body.

1052
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.778
Sheet of paper, not a body!

1053
00:52:19.447 --> 00:52:20.489
Yeah. It's time.

1054
00:52:22.449 --> 00:52:24.200
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Breathe.

1055
00:52:24.284 --> 00:52:25.368
Breathe, Roderick!

1056
00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:28.121
Yeah! Breathe!

1057
00:52:28.203 --> 00:52:30.330
Yes, I have deleted
all remnants of the list

1058
00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.956
on my hard drive.

1059
00:52:32.039 --> 00:52:34.720
But remember, oh weak one, we are
putting a tulip to mark this spot.

1060
00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:36.960
If you wuss out, we will dig it up.

1061
00:52:37.043 --> 00:52:38.587
- Wait. One more name?
- Oh, Rod!

1062
00:52:38.669 --> 00:52:40.337
Please?

1063
00:52:41.505 --> 00:52:43.466
Couple of letters
I'm gonna give ya.

1064
00:52:44.466 --> 00:52:45.383
Dr. Mir-

1065
00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.594
Please, one more letter.

1066
00:52:48.677 --> 00:52:50.846
What's that gonna make?
One letter-no!

1067
00:52:52.889 --> 00:52:54.974
Don't grab it!

1068
00:52:55.056 --> 00:52:56.016
Mir-Mir-

1069
00:52:56.099 --> 00:52:57.142
- One more letter!
- That's it!

1070
00:52:57.225 --> 00:52:58.977
We're ready!

1071
00:53:01.353 --> 00:53:03.355
I'm starting to take
a liking to Trixie.

1072
00:53:03.438 --> 00:53:05.064
I think she's
a very good influence.

1073
00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:06.900
It's not gonna happen, Beta.

1074
00:53:06.982 --> 00:53:09.735
You can't bury
something that precious.

1075
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:14.947
Death Nell took
her tenth victim last night.

1076
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:16.281
- Hm?
- That double-digit rule.

1077
00:53:16.364 --> 00:53:18.909
When a serial killer
hits ten, we get called.

1078
00:53:18.991 --> 00:53:21.160
We-Like we don't have
enough on our plate?

1079
00:53:21.243 --> 00:53:22.870
I thought she only did comas!

1080
00:53:22.952 --> 00:53:24.704
Not last night.

1081
00:53:24.788 --> 00:53:26.039
But on the side of the bright,

1082
00:53:26.121 --> 00:53:28.207
home base says the machine
has taken an interest.

1083
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:31.001
No way he's really doing it!

1084
00:53:31.084 --> 00:53:32.919
- Ready?
- Quick. Before I change my mind.

1085
00:53:33.002 --> 00:53:36.130
Way to go, Roderick.

1086
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:37.923
Way to go.

1087
00:53:41.759 --> 00:53:42.968
Rod, you're missing this.

1088
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:44.385
They crossed into our territory.

1089
00:53:44.469 --> 00:53:45.845
We could lose this.

1090
00:53:45.929 --> 00:53:48.181
I know. Isn't it exciting?

1091
00:53:48.263 --> 00:53:50.182
If we blow it again in their red zone,

1092
00:53:50.264 --> 00:53:51.891
it's gonna leave a bad
taste in my mouth.

1093
00:53:51.974 --> 00:53:53.184
That's what your boyfriend
said last night.

1094
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:55.937
- Hey...
- Lester, what are you feeding your turtle?

1095
00:53:56.019 --> 00:53:58.230
Ugh. Anything that
will make him sick.

1096
00:53:58.312 --> 00:53:59.814
I'm sorry, Skippy.

1097
00:53:59.897 --> 00:54:02.233
But Daddy's gotta see
that veterinarian.

1098
00:54:02.315 --> 00:54:03.900
What?
This is nothing!

1099
00:54:03.983 --> 00:54:05.777
I saw this freak in a parking lot

1100
00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:07.946
try to shove a bottle opener
in a Great Dane's ass,

1101
00:54:08.028 --> 00:54:09.196
just to get an
emergency appointment.

1102
00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:11.073
Are you talking about
the vet over on Vera Donna?

1103
00:54:11.197 --> 00:54:13.449
- Oh...
- Lizzie threatened to put Mr. Whiskers to sleep

1104
00:54:13.533 --> 00:54:14.813
if I went near that place again.

1105
00:54:14.866 --> 00:54:17.077
- She is so pretty.
- Mmm.

1106
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.662
But not in like a, "I'm a model,

1107
00:54:18.744 --> 00:54:19.954
don't fucking look at me" way.

1108
00:54:20.037 --> 00:54:22.915
- And she's just so smart and funny.
- Yes.

1109
00:54:22.997 --> 00:54:25.166
And you know what I love about her?
My favorite thing.

1110
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:26.501
- The way she cracks her neck.
- Mmm-mm-mm.

1111
00:54:26.583 --> 00:54:29.128
- What about that silver anklet of hers?
- Ohh...

1112
00:54:29.211 --> 00:54:30.971
You know, if you can't
make it to the clinic,

1113
00:54:31.003 --> 00:54:32.403
you should try the gym
on Wednesday,

1114
00:54:32.422 --> 00:54:34.132
or Trader Joe's on Thursday.

1115
00:54:34.214 --> 00:54:35.799
- Well, I do like Trader Joe's.
- Yeah.

1116
00:54:35.882 --> 00:54:37.259
It's all on the
Dr. Miranda Storm website.

1117
00:54:37.342 --> 00:54:38.593
Yeah, it's a website.
I've been there.

1118
00:54:38.676 --> 00:54:41.887
It's put together by one of these
real stalker geek types.

1119
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:44.181
Oh, thank God
you're not one of those.

1120
00:54:44.264 --> 00:54:46.224
Ladies, we've got
a football game going on here.

1121
00:54:46.306 --> 00:54:48.267
Enough talking about
the X chromosome.

1122
00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:51.478
Especially the almighty
Dr. Miranda-

1123
00:54:53.563 --> 00:54:55.106
Dr. Mir-

1124
00:54:58.065 --> 00:54:59.191
Is he smirking?

1125
00:54:59.275 --> 00:55:00.276
You're smirking.
Why is Rod smirking?

1126
00:55:00.359 --> 00:55:01.819
Interception!

1127
00:55:01.902 --> 00:55:03.237
You see it?

1128
00:55:04.904 --> 00:55:06.281
I told you!
I told you!

1129
00:55:06.363 --> 00:55:08.782
Yes! Oh, yes!

1130
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.120
Phew. Perfecto.

1131
00:55:14.202 --> 00:55:16.747
I can still make Miranda's
4:20 Starbucks appearance.

1132
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:17.873
She orders a...

1133
00:55:17.956 --> 00:55:19.416
Macchiato with extra foam.

1134
00:55:19.498 --> 00:55:21.667
I could use some caffeine myself.
I'll come with.

1135
00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:24.211
No, you're not getting anywhere
near her, Midas Dick.

1136
00:55:24.294 --> 00:55:25.462
Fine. I'll go to Deitrich's, then.

1137
00:55:25.545 --> 00:55:26.671
I got work to do, anyway.

1138
00:55:26.754 --> 00:55:28.005
Please, Rod.

1139
00:55:28.088 --> 00:55:29.923
Just this one time,
don't seduce this-

1140
00:55:31.382 --> 00:55:34.343
Oh, diarrhea! Yes!

1141
00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:16.666
You always carry
a bottle opener?

1142
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:20.128
This little guy?
He's been through a lot.

1143
00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:23.047
I quit my job today because
of this bottle opener.

1144
00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:25.965
Not-so-great day.
Long story.

1145
00:56:29.134 --> 00:56:30.677
Why were you staring at me?

1146
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.054
Oh, don't worry, Doc.
I'm not one of your stalkers.

1147
00:56:33.137 --> 00:56:36.391
If I were, I'd be at Starbucks
about now, wouldn't I?

1148
00:56:36.473 --> 00:56:38.892
You've seen the website.

1149
00:56:38.974 --> 00:56:40.476
No. I've-
I've heard about it.

1150
00:56:40.559 --> 00:56:41.977
I've heard about you.

1151
00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.813
Really. Well, you missed out.

1152
00:56:44.896 --> 00:56:46.272
It's quite good.

1153
00:56:46.355 --> 00:56:49.900
It's got great graphics,
challenging quizzes.

1154
00:56:49.983 --> 00:56:53.904
It's obviously caused me
to rearrange my rituals.

1155
00:56:57.823 --> 00:56:59.700
You're not gonna use
your spoon, are you?

1156
00:57:15.794 --> 00:57:18.046
Okay. The bottle opener,
I'm gonna let slide.

1157
00:57:18.129 --> 00:57:20.923
But the spoon?
Start talking.

1158
00:57:21.048 --> 00:57:23.217
A place like this,
it gives you a knife,

1159
00:57:23.299 --> 00:57:25.635
a fork, a spoon,
wrapped in a napkin.

1160
00:57:25.719 --> 00:57:27.262
Now the knife,
the fork, the napkin,

1161
00:57:27.344 --> 00:57:28.762
they all get used.

1162
00:57:28.846 --> 00:57:31.515
Most cafe items,
they don't call for a spoon.

1163
00:57:31.597 --> 00:57:34.225
But that little guy, he gets thrown
in the washing machine,

1164
00:57:34.307 --> 00:57:37.060
over and over,
time and time again.

1165
00:57:37.144 --> 00:57:39.146
Without a sense of worth.

1166
00:57:40.438 --> 00:57:42.148
Not only compassionate
to furry creatures,

1167
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:43.940
but inanimate objects as well.

1168
00:57:44.024 --> 00:57:47.569
There's gonna be some fun
in the chat room tonight.

1169
00:57:48.902 --> 00:57:51.238
You're doing it again.

1170
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.908
That funny, charming
staring thing.

1171
00:57:58.534 --> 00:57:59.869
It's not unpleasant.

1172
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.750
But you should know that I...
recently got out

1173
00:58:05.832 --> 00:58:08.001
of a very bad relationship, so I'm-

1174
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:11.837
Yeah, I just got out of
a lot of bad relationships.

1175
00:58:11.919 --> 00:58:13.504
I promise I won't
fall in love with you

1176
00:58:13.588 --> 00:58:16.341
as long as you promise you won't
fall in love with me.

1177
00:58:19.675 --> 00:58:21.093
Oh, I promise.

1178
00:58:27.222 --> 00:58:29.600
Favorite Vonnegut.
One, two, three.

1179
00:58:29.683 --> 00:58:31.018
Cat's Cradle.

1180
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.394
Favorite Dylan.
One, two, three.

1181
00:58:33.478 --> 00:58:35.688
Nashville Skyline.

1182
00:58:37.564 --> 00:58:40.859
Funniest movie ever made.
One, two, three.

1183
00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:42.485
- Some Like It Hot.
- Caddyshack.

1184
00:58:42.567 --> 00:58:43.818
Oh. Guys in dresses.

1185
00:58:43.902 --> 00:58:46.404
That's really reinventing
the wheel there, Roderick.

1186
00:58:46.487 --> 00:58:48.364
A woman who likes Caddyshack.

1187
00:58:48.447 --> 00:58:49.607
Who wouldn't like Caddyshack?

1188
00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:51.617
Favorite porno? One, two, three.

1189
00:58:53.576 --> 00:58:55.703
All those tingling thrill-of-the-pursuit

1190
00:58:55.786 --> 00:58:57.329
feelings came flooding back.

1191
00:58:57.412 --> 00:58:59.748
So then came wish three.

1192
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.582
I said I wanted
a pumpkin as a head.

1193
00:59:03.917 --> 00:59:06.169
Sure, I had the whole
"Dr. Mir" thing,

1194
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.046
from my peek at the list, to clue me
into where Miranda and I were heading.

1195
00:59:09.129 --> 00:59:11.465
But this would be
more than a romance.

1196
00:59:11.547 --> 00:59:14.509
More than a mere
checking-off of a name.

1197
00:59:15.509 --> 00:59:17.636
This would be love.

1198
00:59:17.719 --> 00:59:19.471
Why rush the sex?

1199
00:59:19.553 --> 00:59:21.639
- Okay.
- All day, people wheel

1200
00:59:21.722 --> 00:59:23.474
and take back
the carts in the front.

1201
00:59:23.556 --> 00:59:25.308
And this poor bastard
in the middle

1202
00:59:25.433 --> 00:59:27.560
- probably hasn't been pushed in months.
- Tragic.

1203
00:59:27.643 --> 00:59:29.228
It's tr-you know what?
It is. Help.

1204
00:59:29.311 --> 00:59:31.647
You know, you say you've been looking
for an idea for a children's book.

1205
00:59:31.729 --> 00:59:33.773
How about all these
inanimate objects of yours?

1206
00:59:33.856 --> 00:59:36.526
The spoon that never gets used.

1207
00:59:36.608 --> 00:59:39.528
The missing sock that
reunites with his twin.

1208
00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:42.738
The multi-CD player that
tragically gets turned off

1209
00:59:42.821 --> 00:59:44.864
seconds before proudly finishing

1210
00:59:44.948 --> 00:59:47.033
a five-disc shuffle.

1211
00:59:49.493 --> 00:59:50.828
That's so it.

1212
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:52.370
Yes, it is.

1213
00:59:53.621 --> 00:59:54.622
Roderick...

1214
00:59:57.082 --> 00:59:59.501
I've been looking
for you all my life.

1215
01:00:06.839 --> 01:00:08.507
You're the best!

1216
01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.302
Come on. Get out.

1217
01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:14.429
Okay. The cheek thing had thrown me a bit.

1218
01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.680
But there's nothing
like a warm kiss

1219
01:00:16.763 --> 01:00:18.765
coming after a delicious
home-cooked meal.

1220
01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:21.017
Compliments to the chef.

1221
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:21.600
Hmm.

1222
01:00:25.228 --> 01:00:27.981
- Yup. I was back in the kitchen.
- Yeah?

1223
01:00:28.063 --> 01:00:30.816
And the chef thinks
you're pretty great, too.

1224
01:00:32.692 --> 01:00:34.694
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just-just not-

1225
01:00:34.776 --> 01:00:36.445
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.
- I'm just feeling-

1226
01:00:36.528 --> 01:00:37.654
Just relax. It's okay-

1227
01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:40.073
- No, Roderick.
- It's all right.

1228
01:00:42.782 --> 01:00:44.701
I adore you.

1229
01:00:44.784 --> 01:00:46.828
I do.

1230
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:48.621
I'm just...

1231
01:00:48.704 --> 01:00:50.039
screwed up about sex.

1232
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:51.331
Ah, it's okay-

1233
01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.499
I mean, you're handsome.

1234
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.335
Devilishly so,
if you must know.

1235
01:00:56.501 --> 01:01:00.964
It's just... you so remind me

1236
01:01:01.047 --> 01:01:02.715
of the guy my mom went out with,

1237
01:01:02.797 --> 01:01:04.507
after the divorce, Rockin' Randy.

1238
01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:05.550
He ran the surf shop.

1239
01:01:05.634 --> 01:01:09.470
And he was a cross
between you and Bam-Bam

1240
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.680
from The Flintstones.

1241
01:01:11.763 --> 01:01:13.181
Listen, okay, look.

1242
01:01:13.264 --> 01:01:15.183
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1243
01:01:15.265 --> 01:01:17.184
I'm not saying that. I'm just-

1244
01:01:19.352 --> 01:01:21.187
I'm just saying
if it's gonna happen...

1245
01:01:22.604 --> 01:01:23.855
it's just gonna happen.

1246
01:01:23.939 --> 01:01:25.899
- Yeah.
- Right?

1247
01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.359
Yeah.

1248
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:28.901
Really, why worry about it?

1249
01:01:31.402 --> 01:01:32.445
You're the best.

1250
01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.365
I'm gonna clean up.

1251
01:01:36.615 --> 01:01:39.117
You can pick out another DVD.

1252
01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.660
Something funny.

1253
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.085
I guess you could say

1254
01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:53.836
that's when the madness set in.

1255
01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.880
Thanks.

1256
01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.757
So Miranda and I went to
the Fellini retrospective yesterday.

1257
01:01:58.839 --> 01:02:01.717
Oh, she said the coolest thing.

1258
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.303
- If Marcelo were alive-
- Have you fucked her yet?

1259
01:02:06.512 --> 01:02:08.013
What is with that question?

1260
01:02:08.097 --> 01:02:09.723
Have you fucked her yet?

1261
01:02:09.807 --> 01:02:11.100
Have you fucked her yet?

1262
01:02:11.182 --> 01:02:13.226
Son...

1263
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:14.602
have you fucked her yet?

1264
01:02:14.685 --> 01:02:15.845
Yo, Rod, have you fucked her-

1265
01:02:15.894 --> 01:02:17.104
Hey, have you-

1266
01:02:24.484 --> 01:02:25.694
Let me tell you something.

1267
01:02:25.777 --> 01:02:29.072
Miranda and I are building
a bond of trust and respect.

1268
01:02:29.154 --> 01:02:31.657
Excuse me for still believing
that love is something

1269
01:02:31.739 --> 01:02:34.909
more than a sloppy
fusion of genitalia.

1270
01:02:34.992 --> 01:02:37.244
Miranda, we need
to discuss something.

1271
01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:40.247
- I-
- Oh, shit.

1272
01:02:40.329 --> 01:02:42.248
- Shit, shit, shit.
- You okay?

1273
01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:43.915
Hide me.
No, just hide me.

1274
01:02:43.999 --> 01:02:45.000
Sure.

1275
01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.919
There's
a Frida Kahlo-looking dude.

1276
01:02:48.002 --> 01:02:48.919
No, no, right-

1277
01:02:49.003 --> 01:02:50.129
Oh, no, I got it.

1278
01:02:50.211 --> 01:02:54.090
I met him at this Halloween
Poe poetry reading thing.

1279
01:02:54.172 --> 01:02:55.799
I can't believe
I slept with him.

1280
01:02:55.882 --> 01:02:56.883
I was wasted.

1281
01:02:56.967 --> 01:02:59.177
Halloween, two weeks
ago Halloween?

1282
01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.512
I told you,
I'm totally screwed up about sex.

1283
01:03:01.596 --> 01:03:04.056
Screwed up about sex?
Screwed up about sex?

1284
01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:05.765
It's more like you're screwing.

1285
01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:07.267
That's funny.

1286
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:08.642
Come on, let's go
somewhere else.

1287
01:03:10.184 --> 01:03:11.394
Bam-Bam.

1288
01:03:16.315 --> 01:03:17.816
Back in the day,

1289
01:03:17.899 --> 01:03:21.445
if a woman didn't have
sex with you it was okay,

1290
01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:25.406
because it wasn't like she was having sex
with anyone else.

1291
01:03:25.488 --> 01:03:28.033
Where is that whore-bitch
Jane Austen when you need her?

1292
01:03:28.115 --> 01:03:30.951
I chose to remember
the good times.

1293
01:03:31.034 --> 01:03:32.201
The way Miranda made you feel

1294
01:03:32.285 --> 01:03:34.913
like you were the only
one in the world.

1295
01:03:34.995 --> 01:03:37.623
That time she read
my slaughterhouse reform bill.

1296
01:03:41.042 --> 01:03:44.295
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

1297
01:03:46.295 --> 01:03:48.714
But then there was
that next day at lunch.

1298
01:03:48.797 --> 01:03:50.049
How was that salad for you?

1299
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:51.049
Oh...

1300
01:03:53.927 --> 01:03:56.721
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1301
01:04:03.934 --> 01:04:07.354
And in conclusion, yeah,
go ahead, crucify me,

1302
01:04:07.436 --> 01:04:09.230
but I refuse to live in a society

1303
01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.982
that has reduced the world
to the question,

1304
01:04:12.065 --> 01:04:13.566
"Have you fucked her yet?"

1305
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.069
That would be a no.

1306
01:04:17.945 --> 01:04:19.465
I don't even think
he's seen her naked.

1307
01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.993
Oh...

1308
01:04:28.077 --> 01:04:31.455
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1309
01:04:31.537 --> 01:04:32.705
What the fuck?

1310
01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:41.213
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1311
01:04:53.388 --> 01:04:55.014
Doctor...

1312
01:04:55.097 --> 01:04:56.807
Mir-hah!

1313
01:04:56.890 --> 01:04:58.392
That's what I'm talking about.

1314
01:04:58.474 --> 01:05:01.269
Yes, Dr. Mirabella Stone!

1315
01:05:01.352 --> 01:05:04.772
No! No!

1316
01:05:04.854 --> 01:05:05.354
No!

1317
01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:18.490
Don't mock me.

1318
01:05:18.573 --> 01:05:20.032
Miranda told me
she was coming out

1319
01:05:20.116 --> 01:05:21.284
of a bad relationship.

1320
01:05:21.367 --> 01:05:24.245
And no one has ever had sex
coming out of a bad relationship.

1321
01:05:24.327 --> 01:05:27.122
Oh, we're moving way too fast,

1322
01:05:27.204 --> 01:05:30.124
I'm not feeling well.

1323
01:05:30.206 --> 01:05:31.708
If someone wants
to have sex with you,

1324
01:05:31.791 --> 01:05:33.293
they'll have sex with you.

1325
01:05:33.376 --> 01:05:35.128
The rest is just dinner theater.

1326
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:38.380
So that's it. The machine.

1327
01:05:38.462 --> 01:05:40.798
Oh, no, the machine is much-

1328
01:05:40.882 --> 01:05:43.926
Sure. The wall has a connection.

1329
01:05:44.009 --> 01:05:45.719
Thing's going to be
the death of me.

1330
01:05:45.802 --> 01:05:48.972
Oh, come on, cheer up,
droopy drawers.

1331
01:05:49.054 --> 01:05:50.764
I mean, look on the side
of the bright.

1332
01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:54.601
Even if you went down
to a tropical island, all right?

1333
01:05:54.683 --> 01:05:57.519
The remaining 34 chicks
on this list

1334
01:05:57.603 --> 01:06:00.147
would be renting jet skis
to zoom down there

1335
01:06:00.229 --> 01:06:02.648
and party with you
whether you liked it or not.

1336
01:06:02.731 --> 01:06:05.108
I don't like it.
I don't want other women.

1337
01:06:05.191 --> 01:06:06.318
I want Miranda!

1338
01:06:07.568 --> 01:06:08.986
I've been a good
sport with this thing.

1339
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:10.487
There was a little weirdness
at the beginning,

1340
01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.572
but I went with the flow.

1341
01:06:12.655 --> 01:06:14.866
I sabotaged a wedding,
I lost deposits,

1342
01:06:14.948 --> 01:06:16.408
I toyed with a lot
of people's feelings,

1343
01:06:16.491 --> 01:06:20.204
including my own,
but I didn't care.

1344
01:06:20.286 --> 01:06:22.205
I care now.

1345
01:06:22.287 --> 01:06:24.748
I have found someone
that touches me

1346
01:06:24.831 --> 01:06:26.166
down to my marrow.

1347
01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.918
And if you think that
some contraption is gonna-

1348
01:06:29.001 --> 01:06:30.044
You know, you know-

1349
01:06:30.126 --> 01:06:32.378
sometimes love is stronger than-

1350
01:06:32.462 --> 01:06:33.796
No, it's not!

1351
01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:45.805
I was so proud of you when you...

1352
01:06:45.889 --> 01:06:47.724
were burying the list in the backyard.

1353
01:06:47.806 --> 01:06:51.310
Horoscopes, psychics,
Tarot cards,

1354
01:06:51.392 --> 01:06:54.562
coming attractions that
give away the whole movie.

1355
01:06:54.645 --> 01:06:57.731
Why must you people
know everything?

1356
01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.441
That's a good point, Alpha, sir.

1357
01:06:59.524 --> 01:07:01.526
Remember when you said
the machine was a mystery?

1358
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:04.111
That could mean that there's
some kind of kink or flaw,

1359
01:07:04.194 --> 01:07:05.237
something that
we don't know about-

1360
01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.113
Stop thinking about
the machine, Mr. Blank.

1361
01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:08.364
It's progress.

1362
01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:11.158
There's nothing
you can do about it.

1363
01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:14.536
Science and technology
don't care whether we live or die.

1364
01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:17.538
Excuse me.

1365
01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:23.167
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1366
01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.544
The solution's been right
in front of us the whole time!

1367
01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:27.045
What, what is it?

1368
01:07:27.127 --> 01:07:28.045
Blow jobs.

1369
01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:30.256
Blow jobs!
Oh, man, what a loophole.

1370
01:07:30.338 --> 01:07:33.091
All right, sex is work.

1371
01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.176
Is she having a good time?
Am I meeting her needs?

1372
01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:36.885
You got to think
about her feelings,

1373
01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:39.847
but with a blow job,
you just lie back,

1374
01:07:39.929 --> 01:07:41.689
every now and then touch
the back of her head

1375
01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:43.057
if you think she's getting tentative.

1376
01:07:43.139 --> 01:07:45.934
I mean, seriously, if someone
gives me an intercourse buffet,

1377
01:07:46.017 --> 01:07:48.103
or just a blow job on a stick,

1378
01:07:48.185 --> 01:07:49.770
I'll take blow job
on a stick, dude.

1379
01:07:49.812 --> 01:07:52.314
No, you people-
you people are sick.

1380
01:07:52.397 --> 01:07:54.607
I've given my heart to Miranda.

1381
01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.108
I want to cradle her
in my arms,

1382
01:07:56.191 --> 01:07:57.992
I want to make the kind of love
where you feel

1383
01:07:58.068 --> 01:08:00.612
as though you're one
living, breathing...

1384
01:08:00.695 --> 01:08:02.296
You really think
she might go down on me?

1385
01:08:03.113 --> 01:08:06.908
Death Nell has just put to sleep

1386
01:08:06.991 --> 01:08:09.285
an entire fraternity in Fresno.

1387
01:08:09.368 --> 01:08:10.369
Eight members.

1388
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:12.078
Death Nell?

1389
01:08:12.203 --> 01:08:13.746
What do you guys do
for a living again?

1390
01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:15.123
It's the double-digit rule.

1391
01:08:15.205 --> 01:08:17.624
When a serial killer hits ten victims,
we get called.

1392
01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:20.294
No, I'm still getting details.

1393
01:08:20.376 --> 01:08:22.128
Apparently...

1394
01:08:23.628 --> 01:08:25.630
Well, apparently it was
the same frat house

1395
01:08:25.714 --> 01:08:26.715
that was acquitted last year

1396
01:08:26.797 --> 01:08:28.632
for manufacturing
the date rape drug.

1397
01:08:39.724 --> 01:08:42.894
D.N. put her own drug in the keg.

1398
01:08:45.395 --> 01:08:46.716
Is that amusing to you, Roderick?

1399
01:08:46.812 --> 01:08:48.480
No, I'm just checking
my messages.

1400
01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:51.150
The almighty machine's rep's
about to take another hit.

1401
01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:54.944
They love the concepts,
they love the drawings,

1402
01:08:54.985 --> 01:08:57.821
they-they're going
to publish the book!

1403
01:08:57.946 --> 01:09:01.241
Rod, I owe you so, so, much!

1404
01:09:01.324 --> 01:09:03.242
There's no way
we are not celebrating tonight.

1405
01:09:03.325 --> 01:09:05.118
Okay? So I'm going
to be at your place,

1406
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.079
8:00 sharp, ready for action.

1407
01:09:09.079 --> 01:09:10.581
I so love you.

1408
01:09:12.332 --> 01:09:15.418
You're a very lucky man to have
found such a soulmate, Mr. Blank,

1409
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:16.627
but unfortunately-

1410
01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:18.420
It's in her voice!

1411
01:09:18.503 --> 01:09:20.171
You don't even need
the bizarro list.

1412
01:09:20.254 --> 01:09:22.173
She doesn't think of you in-

1413
01:09:22.255 --> 01:09:24.257
Roderick...

1414
01:09:25.634 --> 01:09:28.261
I'm certain that some
very interesting things

1415
01:09:28.344 --> 01:09:30.554
will occur this evening.

1416
01:09:30.637 --> 01:09:33.097
Your penis going into her vagina
will not be one them.

1417
01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:37.809
But have a lovely evening.

1418
01:09:39.143 --> 01:09:40.728
Gentlemen, I'd love
to stay and chat,

1419
01:09:40.812 --> 01:09:44.190
but I got a date with a lady.

1420
01:09:55.155 --> 01:09:57.616
I don't think he's even seen her naked.

1421
01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:06.373
Hey!

1422
01:10:06.455 --> 01:10:07.581
Author!

1423
01:10:07.665 --> 01:10:08.999
Author!

1424
01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:11.001
Thank you.
J.K. Rowling, eat shit.

1425
01:10:11.084 --> 01:10:14.587
I'm so sorry I'm late,
it's just-

1426
01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.213
It's been crazy.

1427
01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:17.923
But I told everyone that
we'd meet them at the bar.

1428
01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:19.633
- It's my treat, for once.
- Everyone?

1429
01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.300
I thought tonight
was between you and-

1430
01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:23.344
I made pesto.

1431
01:10:25.595 --> 01:10:27.139
You did.

1432
01:10:27.221 --> 01:10:30.015
That's so sweet,
but Rod, we gotta go out.

1433
01:10:30.098 --> 01:10:31.766
We're celebrating!

1434
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:33.685
My brother and the two Jessicas,
they're already there,

1435
01:10:33.768 --> 01:10:35.270
but you know what,
it's no big deal.

1436
01:10:35.352 --> 01:10:37.062
- Hey, hey, just relax.
- Listen, if you-what?

1437
01:10:37.146 --> 01:10:38.564
Let's just hang for a bit,

1438
01:10:38.646 --> 01:10:41.399
you know, a little pre-party.

1439
01:10:41.482 --> 01:10:44.986
Dude, I thought
we were past this.

1440
01:10:47.153 --> 01:10:48.362
No?

1441
01:10:51.906 --> 01:10:54.534
Miranda, I know you once said
you weren't attracted to me,

1442
01:10:54.616 --> 01:10:57.119
but that was before
we went on the camping trip.

1443
01:10:57.202 --> 01:11:00.205
That was before I loaded
the graphics program into your laptop.

1444
01:11:00.288 --> 01:11:03.082
- Before-
- Why is it that men think that women-

1445
01:11:03.165 --> 01:11:08.837
women are like these giant
thermometers at those telethons,

1446
01:11:08.919 --> 01:11:10.588
where every time you do
something nice for them,

1447
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:13.089
they get a little redder,
and a little redder,

1448
01:11:13.173 --> 01:11:14.841
and a little redder,
and a little redder,

1449
01:11:14.923 --> 01:11:16.633
and when you hit the top,
we have to fuck you?

1450
01:11:16.717 --> 01:11:18.427
That is not funny!

1451
01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:19.802
Shit!

1452
01:11:19.886 --> 01:11:20.845
Okay, I'm sorry.

1453
01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:23.014
All right, just slip on down here,

1454
01:11:23.096 --> 01:11:24.931
just do a little clean-up.

1455
01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:31.687
Hey, what are the five
scariest words a woman can say?

1456
01:11:31.769 --> 01:11:34.147
- I wanna be-
- Just friends.

1457
01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:43.946
You know, it's like
some bad stand-up routine.

1458
01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:47.240
Just? Just.

1459
01:11:47.323 --> 01:11:50.117
Do you know how
important it was for me

1460
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.118
to make one real friend
in this city?

1461
01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:58.040
I would die for you.

1462
01:11:58.122 --> 01:12:00.958
Who do you think
I'm dedicating my book to?

1463
01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:02.960
My insane parents?

1464
01:12:04.461 --> 01:12:09.800
"To Roderick Blank, my friend."

1465
01:12:17.054 --> 01:12:19.306
Nice celebration.

1466
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:33.858
Oh, Miranda.

1467
01:12:34.067 --> 01:12:35.652
Man, that is one tough break.

1468
01:12:35.734 --> 01:12:37.778
Girlfriend finds out her little book's

1469
01:12:37.861 --> 01:12:40.280
getting published and then...

1470
01:12:40.363 --> 01:12:41.364
It's terrible.

1471
01:12:44.116 --> 01:12:47.035
Not my girlfriend.

1472
01:12:48.327 --> 01:12:50.037
For what it's worth, from our end,

1473
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.163
we're satisfied the death
was just an accident.

1474
01:12:52.247 --> 01:12:53.873
Just-

1475
01:12:53.957 --> 01:12:54.916
Excuse me, officer,

1476
01:12:54.998 --> 01:12:57.626
I wanted to give
Mr. Blank the opportunity

1477
01:12:57.709 --> 01:13:00.587
- to say goodbye to his girlfriend.
- Not my-

1478
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:02.088
Can I be alone with her?

1479
01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.510
Miranda.

1480
01:13:09.593 --> 01:13:12.096
Oh, precious Miranda.

1481
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:17.057
You know, I never wanted this.

1482
01:13:17.141 --> 01:13:20.227
I- I only wanted-

1483
01:13:20.309 --> 01:13:22.311
They said that we could never,

1484
01:13:22.394 --> 01:13:24.312
never ever be together.

1485
01:13:26.647 --> 01:13:28.899
But hey,

1486
01:13:28.983 --> 01:13:31.068
we're gonna have the last laugh,

1487
01:13:31.151 --> 01:13:32.485
are we not, my love?

1488
01:13:43.493 --> 01:13:46.913
Okay, now that I think about it,

1489
01:13:46.996 --> 01:13:49.039
maybe this is where
the madness set in.

1490
01:13:49.123 --> 01:13:52.084
Yes, I know,
my beacon of light.

1491
01:13:52.167 --> 01:13:55.462
This is sad, this is desperate,

1492
01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:58.172
this is disgusting,

1493
01:13:58.254 --> 01:14:01.090
but aren't all revolutions?

1494
01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:04.843
We have to stand up to the list.

1495
01:14:04.926 --> 01:14:07.804
Stand up to the machine.

1496
01:14:07.887 --> 01:14:11.056
Stand up to fate.

1497
01:14:11.139 --> 01:14:13.308
Stand up, soldier.

1498
01:14:13.391 --> 01:14:15.310
Oh, come on, stand up.

1499
01:14:57.007 --> 01:15:00.219
Oh, let it out, Mr. Blank.

1500
01:15:00.301 --> 01:15:02.720
It's okay. Let it out.

1501
01:15:04.137 --> 01:15:07.015
You poor, sweet man.

1502
01:15:07.098 --> 01:15:11.185
You poor, sweet, handsome man.

1503
01:15:21.234 --> 01:15:24.237
Oh, shh...

1504
01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.571
It's okay.

1505
01:15:45.627 --> 01:15:47.212
Sorry.

1506
01:15:47.294 --> 01:15:50.673
Believe me, I'd hoped it was
a dream sequence, too.

1507
01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.299
If it makes you feel any better,

1508
01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:56.678
my tale has a satisfying ending.

1509
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.179
But this isn't it.

1510
01:15:59.262 --> 01:16:01.931
It's only number 67.

1511
01:16:54.428 --> 01:16:57.264
Six, five, four,

1512
01:16:57.347 --> 01:17:02.394
three, two, one,
Happy New Year!

1513
01:17:12.358 --> 01:17:14.235
Nobody has said
"Happy New Year" to you.

1514
01:17:14.318 --> 01:17:16.278
Thank you. Roderick Blank.

1515
01:17:16.362 --> 01:17:18.322
Ester Fenchel.

1516
01:17:18.404 --> 01:17:20.114
But your friends call you Terry.

1517
01:17:20.198 --> 01:17:22.075
No, but that's strange

1518
01:17:22.157 --> 01:17:25.494
because that's
my husband's name, Terry.

1519
01:17:25.577 --> 01:17:27.079
Nice tie.

1520
01:17:31.873 --> 01:17:34.125
Just leave the bottle.

1521
01:17:35.459 --> 01:17:38.545
Gentlemen, I give you the Matador.

1522
01:17:41.547 --> 01:17:43.758
Oh! No!
Not the prototype!

1523
01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.343
Eating and starving,

1524
01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:48.803
and eating and starving.

1525
01:17:48.886 --> 01:17:51.847
I was told to take some time off,

1526
01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.516
to get away from it all for a while.

1527
01:17:54.598 --> 01:17:57.226
But there was no escape.

1528
01:17:57.309 --> 01:17:59.395
I had noticed a lot
of French, German,

1529
01:17:59.477 --> 01:18:01.270
and Italian names on the list,

1530
01:18:01.354 --> 01:18:03.648
so I dutifully booked
passage to Europe.

1531
01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.982
Hearing of all
the magnifique women,

1532
01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:07.427
my friends concluded
that I had had

1533
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:10.861
the greatest vacation
of all time.

1534
01:18:10.944 --> 01:18:12.654
I'm glad they enjoyed it.

1535
01:18:33.962 --> 01:18:35.004
Good evening.

1536
01:18:35.087 --> 01:18:38.507
You have to fuck me,
so come over and fuck me.

1537
01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.009
No dinner.
Do you have a pen?

1538
01:18:41.092 --> 01:18:42.343
Let me give you directions.

1539
01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:43.677
Ew!

1540
01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:51.599
Hello.

1541
01:18:51.683 --> 01:18:55.228
Oh, star 69.
Yes, it was a crank.

1542
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:57.354
I'm sorry.

1543
01:18:57.438 --> 01:18:59.148
Your mother picked up?
Fainted?

1544
01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.524
- Yes.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1545
01:19:03.483 --> 01:19:05.152
Why are you laughing?

1546
01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:07.612
In my own feeble way,

1547
01:19:07.695 --> 01:19:09.572
I had tried to defy the list.

1548
01:19:09.655 --> 01:19:10.740
But once again,

1549
01:19:10.822 --> 01:19:12.782
the list knew what it was doing,

1550
01:19:12.866 --> 01:19:14.868
what I was doing.

1551
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.285
But guess what.

1552
01:19:16.368 --> 01:19:17.494
I was about to meet a woman

1553
01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:20.914
that was the answer
to all my problems.

1554
01:19:20.997 --> 01:19:23.499
- Hope?
- Amber Anne.

1555
01:19:23.582 --> 01:19:25.125
Roderick?

1556
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:33.424
I've been trying for years
to get a rise out of my mother.

1557
01:19:33.506 --> 01:19:36.009
You did it in five seconds.

1558
01:19:37.551 --> 01:19:39.386
Name your poison.

1559
01:19:39.469 --> 01:19:41.012
Hope Hartlight was the author

1560
01:19:41.095 --> 01:19:43.181
of a best-selling self-help book.

1561
01:19:43.263 --> 01:19:46.433
I found her to be
warm, compassionate,

1562
01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.142
and a little old.

1563
01:19:48.225 --> 01:19:50.519
So I wasn't attracted
to Hope Hartlight.

1564
01:19:50.602 --> 01:19:53.104
It's not like I was going to get out
of having sex with her.

1565
01:19:53.188 --> 01:19:56.358
So, to her surprise,
I asked her out again,

1566
01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.026
figuring we'd eventually
accidentally end up having sex,

1567
01:19:59.108 --> 01:20:01.527
and I could move on.

1568
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:04.656
But a funny thing happened.

1569
01:20:04.738 --> 01:20:06.573
Hope listened.

1570
01:20:06.656 --> 01:20:08.991
Hope guided.

1571
01:20:09.075 --> 01:20:12.578
Hope was literature
after ten months of pop-up books,

1572
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:14.954
chess after ten months
of checkers.

1573
01:20:15.037 --> 01:20:17.081
You're a chapter 17.

1574
01:20:17.164 --> 01:20:18.707
May she spring eternal-

1575
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:21.417
As for my friends,
what do you think?

1576
01:20:21.501 --> 01:20:23.461
Hope was an Earth-mother goddess,

1577
01:20:23.543 --> 01:20:25.712
put down here to save
the sinner's soul.

1578
01:20:25.796 --> 01:20:28.215
If you let her go,
I'll bring her back.

1579
01:20:28.297 --> 01:20:30.383
You know, you strike me
as the kind of guy

1580
01:20:30.465 --> 01:20:32.509
who would make fun
of a one-month

1581
01:20:32.592 --> 01:20:34.844
anniversary celebration.

1582
01:20:34.927 --> 01:20:37.471
You've changed me.

1583
01:20:37.554 --> 01:20:39.223
You've healed me.

1584
01:20:44.643 --> 01:20:46.687
That's a really
beautiful thing to say.

1585
01:20:46.769 --> 01:20:48.479
Thank you.

1586
01:20:48.562 --> 01:20:50.940
You know, I've got
that book signing

1587
01:20:51.022 --> 01:20:53.108
next week in Vermont.

1588
01:20:53.191 --> 01:20:55.652
I'm thinking maybe
you should come with me.

1589
01:20:55.734 --> 01:20:58.028
They've got a terrific
bed and breakfast up there.

1590
01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:59.070
Oh, my God.

1591
01:20:59.153 --> 01:21:00.530
We could just sleep late,

1592
01:21:00.613 --> 01:21:03.449
on the day I don't
have to work, of course.

1593
01:21:03.532 --> 01:21:05.742
But you could just
hang out all day.

1594
01:21:05.826 --> 01:21:07.703
You can walk around naked
in the backyard.

1595
01:21:07.785 --> 01:21:09.745
There's nobody there,
it's off-season.

1596
01:21:11.538 --> 01:21:12.998
Hope Hartlight didn't really vanish

1597
01:21:13.081 --> 01:21:15.375
into thin air like that.

1598
01:21:15.457 --> 01:21:16.917
It took a couple of weeks.

1599
01:21:17.001 --> 01:21:18.627
How could being the answer
to all my problems

1600
01:21:18.710 --> 01:21:20.003
not be enough?

1601
01:21:20.086 --> 01:21:22.171
If a friend of mine had
been going out with Hope,

1602
01:21:22.254 --> 01:21:23.880
I'd be so proud of him.

1603
01:21:23.964 --> 01:21:25.424
Guess that's the problem.

1604
01:21:25.507 --> 01:21:27.509
I'd be proud,
but I wouldn’t be jealous.

1605
01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:29.427
And a man would rather have
another man's jealousy

1606
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.470
than another man's respect.

1607
01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.931
Man, hate to say
that one out loud.

1608
01:21:36.724 --> 01:21:38.183
Okay.

1609
01:21:38.266 --> 01:21:40.810
So, maybe Hope wasn't
the hottest piece of pie

1610
01:21:40.893 --> 01:21:42.312
you've ever been with,

1611
01:21:42.394 --> 01:21:44.646
but Roderick,
I was so proud of you.

1612
01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.250
Us married guys are taking a lot
of heat over this one, big guy.

1613
01:21:47.606 --> 01:21:49.150
It seems that you broke some

1614
01:21:49.233 --> 01:21:51.694
"messing with the feelings
of a woman over 35" covenant.

1615
01:21:51.776 --> 01:21:54.863
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to do an intervention.

1616
01:21:54.945 --> 01:21:57.531
No, we agreed we wouldn't use
the word "intervention."

1617
01:21:57.614 --> 01:21:59.950
- Of course it's an intervention.
- Okay.

1618
01:22:00.033 --> 01:22:01.576
Poor Rod, still under the illusion

1619
01:22:01.659 --> 01:22:03.119
that out there walking around

1620
01:22:03.201 --> 01:22:05.370
is the perfect girl, just for him.

1621
01:22:05.537 --> 01:22:07.748
News break! This just in.

1622
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:09.582
The woman known to
the world as Death Nell

1623
01:22:09.665 --> 01:22:11.667
has apparently left
her driver's license

1624
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.877
at the site of her latest attack.

1625
01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.041
It is the break in the case

1626
01:22:15.085 --> 01:22:18.213
investigators have been hoping
and praying for all year.

1627
01:22:18.296 --> 01:22:21.299
And now, Channel Nine gives you
an exclusive first look

1628
01:22:21.382 --> 01:22:24.052
at this dramatic license.

1629
01:22:24.134 --> 01:22:25.385
If you're just joining us,

1630
01:22:25.469 --> 01:22:27.596
Death Nell seduced and sedated

1631
01:22:27.678 --> 01:22:30.640
misogynist shock jock D.J. Harry Hunt

1632
01:22:30.722 --> 01:22:31.931
during a commercial break

1633
01:22:32.015 --> 01:22:33.376
on his morning drive-time program.

1634
01:22:33.433 --> 01:22:35.769
I appreciate everyone's
concern here.

1635
01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.395
I, um...

1636
01:22:38.478 --> 01:22:39.395
Hello?

1637
01:22:39.479 --> 01:22:40.938
Hey, Trixie, turn that up.

1638
01:22:41.022 --> 01:22:43.941
Did they really catch
that satanic succubus?

1639
01:22:44.024 --> 01:22:47.277
No, and the word's
"freedom fighter."

1640
01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.695
- Can we go in closer on that license-
- Let me guess.

1641
01:22:49.779 --> 01:22:52.114
I'm gonna bet that
her real name is not Death Nell!

1642
01:22:52.197 --> 01:22:54.950
This is some intervention.

1643
01:22:55.032 --> 01:22:56.700
Gillian De Raisx.

1644
01:22:56.784 --> 01:23:00.412
That name again, folks,
Gillian De Raisx.

1645
01:23:00.495 --> 01:23:03.790
Death Nell is Gillian De Raisx.

1646
01:23:03.872 --> 01:23:07.584
Gillian De Raisx. The X is silent.

1647
01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:09.627
It was a name that sounded familiar.

1648
01:23:09.710 --> 01:23:12.755
And when a name sounded
familiar, it usually meant...

1649
01:23:15.214 --> 01:23:18.926
Okay, this wasn't happening.

1650
01:23:19.008 --> 01:23:20.677
I know what you're thinking.

1651
01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.346
Surely I would have memorized
the last name on the list.

1652
01:23:23.428 --> 01:23:26.807
Not to put too fine
a point on it, but why?

1653
01:23:26.889 --> 01:23:29.392
No one wants to think about
the last name on the list,

1654
01:23:29.475 --> 01:23:32.728
because the last name
on the list means...

1655
01:23:34.311 --> 01:23:36.313
What did you say to him?
Where's he going?

1656
01:23:49.532 --> 01:23:50.491
Fred!

1657
01:23:50.573 --> 01:23:52.409
Oh, man, it's kind of funny.

1658
01:23:52.492 --> 01:23:54.619
It's not like she's the next one.

1659
01:23:54.702 --> 01:23:56.036
She may not be the next one,

1660
01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.371
but she sure as hell is the last one.

1661
01:23:57.454 --> 01:23:59.832
Hey, there's got to be
another woman on the planet

1662
01:23:59.914 --> 01:24:01.666
whose name is Gillian De aisx.

1663
01:24:01.749 --> 01:24:03.793
With her last name
spelled with a silent X?

1664
01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:05.585
- I don't think so.
- Calm down.

1665
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:09.923
Gillian de Raisx may not be
the Gillian de Raisx.

1666
01:24:10.006 --> 01:24:12.383
As you can see,
the machine is closing in

1667
01:24:12.465 --> 01:24:14.342
on the one known as Death Nell.

1668
01:24:14.425 --> 01:24:16.343
The timelines have been
just a little off, but-

1669
01:24:16.427 --> 01:24:17.428
Oh, great.

1670
01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:25.601
More coordinates.

1671
01:24:25.684 --> 01:24:28.395
At this rate, I'd say
a couple of weeks from now

1672
01:24:28.477 --> 01:24:30.396
by the end of March,
the Oracle will tell us

1673
01:24:30.478 --> 01:24:31.688
where Gillian de Raisx is staying

1674
01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:33.607
at the precise moment
she's staying there.

1675
01:24:33.690 --> 01:24:36.234
Now, I'm assuming,
Mr. Blank,

1676
01:24:36.317 --> 01:24:38.235
that you can hold off from
having sex with how many?

1677
01:24:38.318 --> 01:24:39.485
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

1678
01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:41.654
Twenty different women
in the next two weeks.

1679
01:24:41.738 --> 01:24:44.324
Hey, I've had sex with three women
in my entire life-

1680
01:24:44.406 --> 01:24:46.658
none if you don't count paying for it.

1681
01:24:46.741 --> 01:24:48.200
I could live off 20 women.

1682
01:24:48.284 --> 01:24:50.870
Now, we can tell you
not to have sex,

1683
01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:53.830
but you have to go beyond that now.

1684
01:24:53.914 --> 01:24:57.792
You have to take your mind
to a whole other realm.

1685
01:24:57.875 --> 01:24:59.877
Read a book you've
always wanted to read.

1686
01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:02.086
I find model airplanes
can be an exacting

1687
01:25:02.169 --> 01:25:03.337
but ultimately rewarding-

1688
01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.463
Model airplanes are great,

1689
01:25:04.546 --> 01:25:05.881
but I got to go back
to the blow jobs.

1690
01:25:05.964 --> 01:25:08.800
Fred. Not constructive.

1691
01:25:08.883 --> 01:25:10.885
How do you feel about biking?

1692
01:25:12.469 --> 01:25:14.596
I can't believe these are
the kind of conversations

1693
01:25:14.678 --> 01:25:16.805
I've become a part of.

1694
01:25:16.889 --> 01:25:18.289
He's still in torment.
Give him one.

1695
01:25:18.348 --> 01:25:19.599
One what?

1696
01:25:19.682 --> 01:25:21.476
Ah, yes, yes.

1697
01:25:21.559 --> 01:25:24.062
Our aforementioned Oracle,

1698
01:25:24.144 --> 01:25:28.065
while rather erratic
in capturing criminals,

1699
01:25:28.147 --> 01:25:30.650
has come up with the answers

1700
01:25:30.732 --> 01:25:33.944
to some of our culture's
most significant mysteries.

1701
01:25:34.027 --> 01:25:36.196
And I think we can
give you one of them.

1702
01:25:36.278 --> 01:25:37.905
Any of the biggies?

1703
01:25:37.988 --> 01:25:41.492
Okay, uh, who killed
Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman?

1704
01:25:41.574 --> 01:25:43.054
- You're kidding.
- Yeah, I'm kidding.

1705
01:25:43.116 --> 01:25:44.243
Let me see.
Let me see.

1706
01:25:44.326 --> 01:25:46.161
How about who really shot JFK?

1707
01:25:46.244 --> 01:25:47.119
Oh, pick another one.

1708
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:48.996
It takes, like, 20 minutes to print out.

1709
01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.081
Okay, life on other planets.

1710
01:25:50.163 --> 01:25:51.498
How many planets
in the universe have-

1711
01:25:51.581 --> 01:25:53.833
- Eleven.
- Eleven? That's it?

1712
01:25:53.917 --> 01:25:55.961
That's it. How many
more do you want?

1713
01:25:56.043 --> 01:25:57.920
Wait a sec.
Does God exist?

1714
01:25:58.003 --> 01:25:59.755
Cut it out. You only get one.

1715
01:25:59.837 --> 01:26:01.965
Please.
You guys are mean.

1716
01:26:02.048 --> 01:26:04.050
You don't want to be in L.A.
on July 4th weekend.

1717
01:26:04.132 --> 01:26:06.843
Beta, enough.

1718
01:26:12.097 --> 01:26:14.849
There are 20 human shields
between you and Miss de Raisx.

1719
01:26:14.932 --> 01:26:17.017
Be conservative.

1720
01:26:17.101 --> 01:26:20.813
Don't use up any of them
until we catch the villainess.

1721
01:26:22.604 --> 01:26:23.772
And remember...

1722
01:26:25.649 --> 01:26:28.026
a new realm of existence.

1723
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:30.695
A new realm of existence.

1724
01:26:30.777 --> 01:26:33.863
No sex...

1725
01:26:33.947 --> 01:26:35.073
no death.

1726
01:26:36.073 --> 01:26:37.783
Good luck.

1750
01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:07.768
"Instead, they helped themselves.

1751
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.602
"Among the girls of the bus,

1752
01:28:09.685 --> 01:28:11.854
"there had been much talk
of the albatross

1753
01:28:11.937 --> 01:28:14.856
"of not having lost one's virginity.

1754
01:28:14.939 --> 01:28:16.398
"My friend's appearance
on the road

1755
01:28:16.482 --> 01:28:18.526
"was taken as a sign.

1756
01:28:18.608 --> 01:28:20.443
"A pact was made.

1757
01:28:20.527 --> 01:28:22.445
"Everyone's virginity must go,

1758
01:28:22.528 --> 01:28:25.072
"and he would be the chosen vessel.

1759
01:28:25.155 --> 01:28:27.074
"All virgins.

1760
01:28:27.156 --> 01:28:29.575
"All 18-year-olds.

1761
01:28:29.659 --> 01:28:31.077
"Uniforms.

1762
01:28:31.159 --> 01:28:35.830
"Nineteen 18-year-old
virgins in uniforms.

1763
01:28:35.913 --> 01:28:38.874
Straws were drawn,
and first up was Mona Farlow."

1764
01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:44.003
Fuck. Fuck!

1765
01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:46.046
Fuck.

1766
01:28:48.839 --> 01:28:52.593
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1767
01:28:52.676 --> 01:28:56.137
Fuck, fuckity,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

1768
01:28:58.013 --> 01:29:00.349
Fuck.

1769
01:29:00.431 --> 01:29:03.810
Fuck. Fuck!

1770
01:29:03.892 --> 01:29:08.188
"It was a day my friend
would never forget."

1771
01:29:08.271 --> 01:29:09.939
Any changes
before we mail it in?

1772
01:29:10.022 --> 01:29:12.316
Please stop. I can't take it.

1773
01:29:13.942 --> 01:29:15.610
I'm curious.
Was there a lot of blood?

1774
01:29:19.112 --> 01:29:20.446
Sorry. Never mind. Wow!

1775
01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:22.407
- The ultimate male perversion.
- God!

1776
01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:23.824
You can die now.

1777
01:29:23.907 --> 01:29:25.868
Well, that seems
to be the problem.

1778
01:29:36.584 --> 01:29:38.794
Have I told you all
the good news?

1779
01:29:38.877 --> 01:29:40.336
I'm getting married.

1780
01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.505
The lucky gal's name
is Ethel Walters.

1781
01:29:42.588 --> 01:29:44.047
I hope you can all
make the wedding.

1782
01:29:44.131 --> 01:29:45.716
Ethel Walters?

1783
01:29:45.799 --> 01:29:46.800
Do we know her?

1784
01:29:46.883 --> 01:29:48.467
I don't know. Do you?

1785
01:29:48.551 --> 01:29:50.678
I really need to get in touch
with her right away.

1786
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.971
Does the name ring a bell
with anyone?

1787
01:29:53.054 --> 01:29:55.348
Maybe you should lie back down.

1788
01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:56.849
Hey, you know what?

1789
01:29:56.932 --> 01:29:58.809
Where was the driver
in all this?

1790
01:29:58.892 --> 01:30:00.476
Because I get that
the church group chaperone

1791
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.854
was on another bus,
but you can't tell me

1792
01:30:02.936 --> 01:30:04.479
they let the second group of girls
just transport themselves.

1793
01:30:04.563 --> 01:30:07.024
The driver, yeah.

1794
01:30:07.106 --> 01:30:09.901
I don't seem to r-

1795
01:30:09.984 --> 01:30:12.528
That's funny. The driver...

1796
01:30:12.611 --> 01:30:14.779
There's a whole lot of action
going on back here.

1797
01:30:14.862 --> 01:30:16.739
Figure I'd get myself a piece.

1798
01:30:16.822 --> 01:30:18.199
Now, now, you relax.

1799
01:30:18.281 --> 01:30:20.909
You skinny little white girls
ain't tattling on nobody.

1800
01:30:20.992 --> 01:30:21.492
Fuck!

1801
01:30:28.748 --> 01:30:30.124
You can't have sex with me!

1802
01:30:30.207 --> 01:30:32.542
Roderick, it's me, Trixie.

1803
01:30:32.626 --> 01:30:33.960
I'm not going to rape you.

1804
01:30:34.044 --> 01:30:35.921
- You know that.
- Just leave me alone.

1805
01:30:36.003 --> 01:30:38.130
Get up, you big baby.

1806
01:30:39.088 --> 01:30:40.882
Got one word for you:
Qantas.

1807
01:30:40.965 --> 01:30:42.509
You are going to Australia.

1808
01:30:42.591 --> 01:30:45.010
Your flight leaves in the morning,
so start packing.

1809
01:30:45.093 --> 01:30:47.429
You don't get it. I can't escape.

1810
01:30:47.512 --> 01:30:50.139
She'll rent a jet ski,
and she'll track me down.

1811
01:30:50.222 --> 01:30:51.848
I was on the Net all night.

1812
01:30:51.932 --> 01:30:53.391
I found another Gillian de Raisx.

1813
01:30:53.475 --> 01:30:55.310
Oh, yeah, that spells
her last name with a-

1814
01:30:55.392 --> 01:30:57.144
Yes, with a silent X.

1815
01:30:58.228 --> 01:31:01.022
She's a marine biologist
based outside of Sydney.

1816
01:31:05.067 --> 01:31:06.151
Oh, this picture.

1817
01:31:06.234 --> 01:31:08.027
Which one's the walrus?

1818
01:31:09.153 --> 01:31:10.446
She's big-boned

1819
01:31:10.529 --> 01:31:12.781
with a healthy appetite
for life, asshole.

1820
01:31:12.948 --> 01:31:14.908
What is-What is that
on her face?

1821
01:31:15.074 --> 01:31:16.157
It's a rash

1822
01:31:16.158 --> 01:31:18.702
from her exploration
of the Barrier Reef.

1823
01:31:18.785 --> 01:31:20.453
- Ooh.
- Oh, God!

1824
01:31:20.537 --> 01:31:22.163
Roderick,

1825
01:31:22.246 --> 01:31:23.580
you'd rather die than have sex

1826
01:31:23.664 --> 01:31:26.792
with an overweight woman
with a slight skin condition?

1827
01:31:26.874 --> 01:31:28.209
But it's-

1828
01:31:28.292 --> 01:31:29.585
it's not that slight.

1829
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:33.005
Trixie, I'm sure she's a great-

1830
01:31:33.088 --> 01:31:35.006
I got you some books
to read on the plane.

1831
01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:37.925
I have underlined some
very good conversation starters.

1832
01:31:38.008 --> 01:31:39.885
So help me, if you
do not go Down Under

1833
01:31:39.968 --> 01:31:41.302
and seduce this Sheila-

1834
01:31:41.386 --> 01:31:43.680
Well, I do like dolphins.

1835
01:31:43.762 --> 01:31:45.055
Trixie.

1836
01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:49.475
No matter what happens,

1837
01:31:49.559 --> 01:31:50.977
thank you for being there.

1838
01:31:51.059 --> 01:31:52.727
You're a true pal.

1839
01:31:55.104 --> 01:31:57.189
It's good to be a lesbian, isn't it?

1840
01:31:57.273 --> 01:31:59.400
Send me a postcard, jerk.

1841
01:32:01.067 --> 01:32:02.735
With a koala on it.

Hey, if you insist, hot rod.

1852
01:32:57.776 --> 01:33:01.655
Listen, the Almighty Oracle
has come through.

1853
01:33:01.738 --> 01:33:03.615
We have confirmation

1854
01:33:03.697 --> 01:33:06.116
that Death Nell
is going to be down here

1855
01:33:06.199 --> 01:33:08.075
at the Mayfair Hotel.

1856
01:33:09.452 --> 01:33:10.495
I've entered her room.

1857
01:33:10.577 --> 01:33:12.788
Mr. A's not here
at this precise moment,

1858
01:33:12.871 --> 01:33:14.873
but her things
most certainly are.

1859
01:33:14.955 --> 01:33:17.708
Friends, I've got chills.

1860
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.377
Fred, Beta, you guys-

1861
01:33:21.461 --> 01:33:23.296
Wait. It's April Fool's Day,
isn't it?

1862
01:33:23.378 --> 01:33:24.463
It's 10 after midnight,

1863
01:33:24.546 --> 01:33:27.007
- officially April 2.
- Ha.

1864
01:33:27.089 --> 01:33:28.382
Yes, Roderick.

1865
01:33:28.466 --> 01:33:30.593
We have quite a welcoming party

1866
01:33:30.675 --> 01:33:32.093
planned for the nasty minx.

1867
01:33:32.177 --> 01:33:33.720
Oh.

1868
01:33:33.804 --> 01:33:37.015
Oh, this is-
this is amazing.

1869
01:33:37.097 --> 01:33:40.893
You don't know
what it's been like.

1870
01:33:40.975 --> 01:33:43.311
And I have found the loophole

1871
01:33:43.393 --> 01:33:44.520
of all loopholes.

1872
01:33:44.603 --> 01:33:45.896
It's not blow jobs,

1873
01:33:45.979 --> 01:33:47.356
and it's not hand jobs.

1874
01:33:47.438 --> 01:33:48.773
It's exes.

1875
01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:51.692
It's ex,
as in ex-girlfriends, all right?

1876
01:33:51.775 --> 01:33:53.151
I want-just-listen.

1877
01:33:53.235 --> 01:33:55.070
Check the names on the list.

1878
01:33:55.152 --> 01:33:57.113
Do any names appear twice?

1879
01:33:57.196 --> 01:33:59.115
Any doubles? All right, no.

1880
01:33:59.197 --> 01:34:00.990
Then don't tell me...

1881
01:34:01.074 --> 01:34:03.576
that you've never hooked up
with some ex-girlfriend

1882
01:34:03.659 --> 01:34:06.328
for a little, uh, you know,
"remember when" sex.

1883
01:34:06.410 --> 01:34:09.038
No, you're right.
I had sex with Laura Baxter

1884
01:34:09.122 --> 01:34:11.207
every time I came
home for Christmas.

1885
01:34:11.289 --> 01:34:12.791
And she's only listed once.

1886
01:34:12.874 --> 01:34:14.709
And whenever I travel
through St. Louis,

1887
01:34:14.792 --> 01:34:16.836
I always stop in on Diana Scott.

1888
01:34:16.919 --> 01:34:19.296
We're going to get you
some reelection sex, all right?

1889
01:34:19.379 --> 01:34:21.840
I'm talking about
Grover Cleveland poontang.

1890
01:34:21.923 --> 01:34:24.134
Go back to Hope, number 80.

1891
01:34:24.216 --> 01:34:26.218
What you had was real.
She'll take you back.

1892
01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:28.136
Yes. There's Hope.

1893
01:34:28.219 --> 01:34:30.596
I've had so many wonderful,
fascinating women in my life.

1894
01:34:30.679 --> 01:34:32.722
I've never really been
worthy of any of them.

1895
01:34:32.764 --> 01:34:34.683
Uhh! Don't listen to Beta.

1896
01:34:34.765 --> 01:34:36.016
Do not listen to him.

1897
01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:38.310
He hates boners
and fun, all right?

1898
01:34:38.351 --> 01:34:41.438
What you have to do is you got
to find that school bus,

1899
01:34:41.563 --> 01:34:44.023
and you got to hook up
with those little Bible brats

1900
01:34:44.148 --> 01:34:46.233
numbers 81 through 99,

1901
01:34:46.315 --> 01:34:49.318
and maybe give 84 a pass
with the back zits.

1902
01:34:49.402 --> 01:34:52.321
- And you just get-get-
- Sir?

1903
01:34:52.404 --> 01:34:55.782
Yes. It's right there.

1904
01:34:55.865 --> 01:34:59.160
Get one of them to change
her name to Gillian de Raisx.

1905
01:34:59.242 --> 01:35:00.410
And you perfect-

1906
01:35:00.452 --> 01:35:02.078
Stop it.

1907
01:35:03.745 --> 01:35:05.956
The theories
on the table are adorable.

1908
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:08.000
But Roderick, be cool.

1909
01:35:08.082 --> 01:35:10.168
Gillian will be
at the hotel any minute,

1910
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:12.002
and our organization-

1911
01:35:12.043 --> 01:35:15.756
well, we don't believe
in trials and arrests.

1912
01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:17.339
So I want you to hang tight,

1913
01:35:17.381 --> 01:35:19.258
and do not, I repeat,

1914
01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.676
do not leave your house.

1915
01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.011
Okay.

1916
01:35:23.093 --> 01:35:24.178
Call you when she's dead.

1917
01:35:24.303 --> 01:35:26.597
All right. I'll be here.

1918
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.431
Thank you. Good-bye.

1919
01:35:30.057 --> 01:35:31.434
Ohh...

1920
01:36:46.197 --> 01:36:49.409
Did you really think
I was gonna get off easy?

1921
01:36:49.492 --> 01:36:52.120
Did you want me to?

1922
01:36:52.202 --> 01:36:54.246
I know I promised you
a satisfying ending,

1923
01:36:54.328 --> 01:36:55.579
but there will be
no triumphant return

1924
01:36:55.663 --> 01:36:58.332
to Fiona, Hope,
or anybody else.

1925
01:36:58.415 --> 01:37:00.959
There will be no chasing a cab,

1926
01:37:01.042 --> 01:37:02.377
no stopping a wedding,

1927
01:37:02.459 --> 01:37:06.380
no tearful reconciliations
on a train platform,

1928
01:37:06.462 --> 01:37:10.675
and no morning flights
to Australia.

1929
01:37:10.757 --> 01:37:14.845
To escape the sins of
my April 2nd to April 2nd saga

1930
01:37:14.927 --> 01:37:18.264
would feel so, so wrong.

1931
01:37:18.346 --> 01:37:19.931
Yes, my true destiny

1932
01:37:20.014 --> 01:37:23.226
was staying in a hotel downtown.

1933
01:37:23.308 --> 01:37:27.146
I was going out with
a lady called Death.

1934
01:37:27.228 --> 01:37:29.605
No God or Machine
could help me now.

1935
01:37:31.481 --> 01:37:33.275
And that felt so,

1936
01:37:33.358 --> 01:37:34.526
so right.

1937
01:37:41.448 --> 01:37:45.827
You live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

1938
01:37:45.909 --> 01:37:48.829
One sexual position left.

1939
01:37:48.911 --> 01:37:50.830
Call it the karma sutra.

1940
01:37:53.206 --> 01:37:55.083
The end is coming.

1941
01:37:55.166 --> 01:37:57.585
And coming is the end.

1942
01:37:57.752 --> 01:37:59.462
We've checked all
the sectors, Fred.

1943
01:37:59.544 --> 01:38:00.587
Okay, you know what?

1944
01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:03.465
My name is not Fred.
It's Commander Delta.

1945
01:38:03.547 --> 01:38:05.632
- It-just go. In.
- Move.

1946
01:38:11.386 --> 01:38:12.471
Excuse me.

1947
01:38:12.554 --> 01:38:14.681
Miss Death? Nell?

1948
01:38:14.764 --> 01:38:17.183
Or do you prefer Gillian?

1949
01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:19.018
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

1950
01:38:21.603 --> 01:38:23.772
Death Nell's alive
and inside us.

1951
01:38:25.147 --> 01:38:26.607
Look at him!
He's so scared!

1952
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:29.692
Aww!

1953
01:38:32.486 --> 01:38:35.363
Oh, where you going?
Come back, ladies' man!

1954
01:38:48.831 --> 01:38:50.375
Whew...

1955
01:38:50.457 --> 01:38:53.668
Well, you caused
quite a commotion out there.

1956
01:38:53.752 --> 01:38:55.962
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

1957
01:38:56.045 --> 01:38:58.089
Tell you? No. I, uh-

1958
01:39:01.841 --> 01:39:02.926
Oh.

1959
01:39:04.176 --> 01:39:05.469
Hi.

1960
01:39:07.178 --> 01:39:08.346
Agents.

1961
01:39:08.429 --> 01:39:11.766
There's agents staked out
at your hotel.

1962
01:39:11.848 --> 01:39:14.351
In your room.

1963
01:39:14.433 --> 01:39:15.601
Thanks.

1964
01:39:17.895 --> 01:39:19.522
You know I'm not innocent, right?

1965
01:39:19.604 --> 01:39:21.314
Yeah.

1966
01:39:24.817 --> 01:39:27.152
Can I-Can I join...

1967
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:50.795
Wow.

1968
01:39:51.837 --> 01:39:54.214
This, uh, place is amazing.

1969
01:39:54.296 --> 01:39:55.548
You know, I'm kind of
in the business.

1970
01:39:55.631 --> 01:39:57.466
I've never heard of it.

1971
01:39:57.550 --> 01:40:00.177
Yeah, I just discovered it
the other night.

1972
01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.263
There are not a lot of places
in this town that stay open late.

1973
01:40:03.345 --> 01:40:05.389
Yeah.

1974
01:40:05.472 --> 01:40:07.933
- Do-You know, I-
- I-Well-

1975
01:40:08.016 --> 01:40:09.058
Sorry.

1976
01:40:09.142 --> 01:40:11.477
- You go.
- No, you go.

1977
01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.480
You know, this is-
this is strange for me.

1978
01:40:15.563 --> 01:40:17.440
I've never had
a volunteer before.

1979
01:40:18.773 --> 01:40:20.775
Some guys will do
anything to get laid.

1980
01:40:24.987 --> 01:40:26.196
Uh-oh.

1981
01:40:33.869 --> 01:40:35.203
This has a...

1982
01:40:35.286 --> 01:40:37.455
a grape aftertaste.

1983
01:40:38.538 --> 01:40:40.457
And you do realize that

1984
01:40:40.540 --> 01:40:43.585
I can't guarantee when or-

1985
01:40:43.667 --> 01:40:46.462
or even if you'll wake up.

1986
01:40:46.544 --> 01:40:48.963
Yeah. No, I understand.

1987
01:40:56.552 --> 01:40:57.678
You mind if I ask you-

1988
01:40:57.762 --> 01:40:59.472
you tell me
if this is too personal,

1989
01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:04.059
but, uh...
how did you get here?

1990
01:41:04.141 --> 01:41:07.394
You know, in the larger sense?

1991
01:41:07.477 --> 01:41:09.078
It's not like I'm gonna
be telling anyone

1992
01:41:09.145 --> 01:41:11.314
for an indefinitely
long period of time.

1993
01:41:15.232 --> 01:41:16.525
I don't know.

1994
01:41:16.609 --> 01:41:18.652
I don't-

1995
01:41:18.735 --> 01:41:20.737
I'm not gonna talk
about my childhood.

1996
01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.990
You know?
'Cause that's not what-

1997
01:41:24.073 --> 01:41:27.576
My childhood wasn't any better
or worse than anyone else-

1998
01:41:27.659 --> 01:41:30.078
Oh, well, okay.
It was a little worse.

1999
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.663
But, uh-but I escaped.

2000
01:41:34.246 --> 01:41:37.375
That's where I studied
poetry and chemistry.

2001
01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:40.336
Obviously better
at the latter than the former.

2002
01:41:40.418 --> 01:41:41.711
No, I wouldn't say that.

2003
01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:43.421
I really enjoy your writing.

2004
01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:52.011
You're right,
these spices do look amazing.

2005
01:41:52.094 --> 01:41:54.221
I mean, I've only read the stuff
that gets printed in the paper,

2006
01:41:54.303 --> 01:41:55.596
after each incident.

2007
01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.016
But what was it you spray-painted
after Number Seven?

2008
01:41:59.099 --> 01:42:01.059
"My ecstasy, your annihilation."

2009
01:42:01.142 --> 01:42:05.063
"Our mess, nothing left to transgress."

2010
01:42:05.145 --> 01:42:07.064
That's good.

2011
01:42:07.146 --> 01:42:10.108
But where was I?
Oh! Yes, of course.

2012
01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:15.612
Before I could graduate,
I was swept off my feet.

2013
01:42:15.695 --> 01:42:17.947
My husband was this, uh-

2014
01:42:19.739 --> 01:42:21.783
everything a girl's
supposed to want, right?

2015
01:42:21.866 --> 01:42:25.036
You know. I was his-
his princess.

2016
01:42:25.119 --> 01:42:28.664
He was my Prince Charming.

2017
01:42:29.664 --> 01:42:31.749
Can I try some of your kale?

2018
01:42:31.832 --> 01:42:35.794
- Trade you for that cherry tomato.
- All right.

2019
01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:46.051
You don't have to go on
if you don't want to.

2020
01:42:46.134 --> 01:42:47.760
No...

2021
01:42:47.844 --> 01:42:51.973
It actually feels good
to say the bad out loud.

2022
01:42:53.682 --> 01:42:57.686
But when I said
I was his princess,

2023
01:42:57.768 --> 01:43:00.313
I wasn't being metaphorical.

2024
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:02.731
Every week,

2025
01:43:02.813 --> 01:43:05.566
a new princess costume
and a new wig.

2026
01:43:05.649 --> 01:43:07.026
"This way, I won't cheat,"

2027
01:43:07.108 --> 01:43:09.610
was the charming way he put it.

2028
01:43:09.694 --> 01:43:12.405
At first, it was... fun?

2029
01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:14.573
But then it wasn't.

2030
01:43:14.655 --> 01:43:16.157
It got rough, and I-

2031
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:32.628
Did he hit you?

2032
01:43:32.711 --> 01:43:34.421
Aw...

2033
01:43:34.503 --> 01:43:37.715
You know, I've put
over 20 men into a coma.

2034
01:43:37.798 --> 01:43:40.801
When you're handing out
that kind of punishment-

2035
01:43:40.884 --> 01:43:42.927
The short answer is yes.

2036
01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:45.054
Yeah, he hit me.

2037
01:43:45.137 --> 01:43:46.972
And pretty much
every other verb

2038
01:43:47.055 --> 01:43:48.890
you could come up with.

2039
01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:50.850
But nothing above the neck.

2040
01:43:50.932 --> 01:43:52.976
The Princess and the Pirate.

2041
01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:55.228
The Princess and the Viking.

2042
01:43:55.311 --> 01:43:58.731
The Princess and
the Mongol Warlord.

2043
01:43:58.813 --> 01:44:00.273
Occasionally, he'd mix it up

2044
01:44:00.357 --> 01:44:02.942
and we'd do The Sound of Music,

2045
01:44:03.025 --> 01:44:05.944
as if the Nazis won.

2046
01:44:06.028 --> 01:44:07.529
You know,
it couldn't be a crime.

2047
01:44:07.612 --> 01:44:08.947
He was my husband.

2048
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:12.659
I did not complain.
I did not ask questions.

2049
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:15.661
Although, why anyone
would want to treat

2050
01:44:15.743 --> 01:44:17.870
Julie Andrews
as a human ashtray...

2051
01:44:17.954 --> 01:44:21.082
As far as questions go,
that's a pretty good one.

2052
01:44:22.539 --> 01:44:24.625
It did improve my poetry, though.

2053
01:44:24.708 --> 01:44:27.461
It gave me a lot of good
material to work with.

2054
01:44:27.543 --> 01:44:29.921
God, you're a good listener, man.

2055
01:44:30.004 --> 01:44:31.881
You really are.

2056
01:44:32.881 --> 01:44:34.383
Oh, God-oh.

2057
01:44:34.465 --> 01:44:37.259
Then came Valentine's Day.

2058
01:44:37.343 --> 01:44:40.596
Oh, that was on a good one.

2059
01:44:40.679 --> 01:44:44.099
My hopeless situation,
my inability to change.

2060
01:44:44.181 --> 01:44:47.726
But all in iambic
pentameter, of course.

2061
01:44:50.519 --> 01:44:53.397
And then...

2062
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:55.774
F-

2063
01:45:11.743 --> 01:45:13.870
I should have
been happy, right?

2064
01:45:13.954 --> 01:45:17.207
They tried everything.
They couldn't wake me up.

2065
01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:19.583
They thought I was in a coma.

2066
01:45:19.666 --> 01:45:21.710
And that's when
I had the vision.

2067
01:45:52.107 --> 01:45:54.860
I had become my own
Prince Charming.

2068
01:45:54.942 --> 01:45:58.237
But there was much work
to be done in my kingdom.

2069
01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.363
Battles to be fought,

2070
01:46:00.447 --> 01:46:02.699
wars to be won.

2071
01:46:04.908 --> 01:46:07.995
You can pretty much
connect the dots from there.

2072
01:46:08.077 --> 01:46:11.372
Costumes, chemistry, poetry,

2073
01:46:11.455 --> 01:46:13.916
mutually degrading sexuality,

2074
01:46:13.999 --> 01:46:16.668
comas, "men suck."

2075
01:46:16.751 --> 01:46:19.311
I don't know how much longer
I can keep running around like this.

2076
01:46:19.377 --> 01:46:20.754
It's not like I can't afford it.

2077
01:46:20.837 --> 01:46:23.757
I mean, my husband
was Victor Rose IV.

2078
01:46:23.839 --> 01:46:25.966
Victor R-wow.

2079
01:46:26.050 --> 01:46:27.259
Small world.

2080
01:46:27.342 --> 01:46:29.802
I kind of had a one-night stand
with his grandma.

2081
01:46:29.886 --> 01:46:31.804
Granny C?

2082
01:46:31.887 --> 01:46:33.931
My story's not
as compelling as yours,

2083
01:46:34.014 --> 01:46:35.599
but, uh, exactly a year ago,

2084
01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:38.225
I received a list of everyone
I'd ever had sex with

2085
01:46:38.308 --> 01:46:40.143
and ever would have sex with.

2086
01:46:40.226 --> 01:46:43.021
I find that very compelling.

2087
01:46:43.103 --> 01:46:45.940
I- I think we should
order dessert.

2088
01:46:46.023 --> 01:46:48.484
Raspberry tart?
Two forks?

2089
01:46:49.901 --> 01:46:52.403
You think I'm lying?

2090
01:46:52.486 --> 01:46:53.862
- You think I'm insane.
- No!

2091
01:46:53.946 --> 01:46:55.656
No. I-

2092
01:46:55.738 --> 01:46:57.907
And believe me,
I am an expert on both.

2093
01:46:58.823 --> 01:47:02.744
But Bambi and Thumper.
Seriously.

2094
01:47:02.826 --> 01:47:04.870
The Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

2095
01:47:04.954 --> 01:47:07.289
Yes. What a night.

2096
01:47:09.249 --> 01:47:12.001
Ohhh, fuck.

2097
01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:14.878
Fuck.

2098
01:47:18.922 --> 01:47:20.715
You know, uh-

2099
01:47:20.799 --> 01:47:22.592
I'd like to think that I-

2100
01:47:22.675 --> 01:47:24.426
I put something
interesting out there

2101
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:26.303
into the atmosphere.

2102
01:47:26.386 --> 01:47:28.471
You know?

2103
01:47:28.554 --> 01:47:31.057
Just the whole idea of a...

2104
01:47:31.139 --> 01:47:34.601
a woman being able
to put a man down like a dog

2105
01:47:34.684 --> 01:47:36.477
for being bad, or...

2106
01:47:38.353 --> 01:47:41.398
for no reason at all.

2107
01:47:41.481 --> 01:47:43.149
I mean, well...

2108
01:47:43.232 --> 01:47:45.109
well, women have
had to deal with

2109
01:47:45.192 --> 01:47:49.154
the anytime, anywhere
dark impulses of men

2110
01:47:49.237 --> 01:47:50.697
forever, so...

2111
01:47:50.779 --> 01:47:53.615
God, I thought...

2112
01:47:53.699 --> 01:47:54.908
it was time to make the men

2113
01:47:54.991 --> 01:47:57.952
shake in their boots
for a while, you know?

2114
01:47:58.035 --> 01:48:00.955
I guess...

2115
01:48:01.037 --> 01:48:03.957
that's how I-
I rationalized it.

2116
01:48:04.039 --> 01:48:06.375
I- I am gone-

2117
01:48:06.457 --> 01:48:08.710
No, that's okay.

2118
01:48:08.793 --> 01:48:10.461
We're all gone.
You know, it's-

2119
01:48:11.503 --> 01:48:15.465
So many games, names.

2120
01:48:15.548 --> 01:48:16.883
Who did you love?

2121
01:48:16.966 --> 01:48:19.677
And who did you really love?

2122
01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:22.095
Did you break their heart?

2123
01:48:22.177 --> 01:48:25.139
Or did they break yours? Or-

2124
01:48:25.222 --> 01:48:28.726
You know there's some
real bliss in there somewhere.

2125
01:48:28.808 --> 01:48:31.811
And all you're left with is...

2126
01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.771
exhaustion.

2127
01:48:39.524 --> 01:48:40.901
I always liked that word.

2128
01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:47.698
Oh, and "depleted,"

2129
01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:51.618
"dissipated," and "spent."

2130
01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:53.952
Those are good ones.

2131
01:48:54.036 --> 01:48:57.289
But "exhaustion..."

2132
01:48:57.371 --> 01:48:59.290
sounds like what it is.

2133
01:49:01.541 --> 01:49:03.960
And what better cure than sleep?

2134
01:49:05.211 --> 01:49:07.213
Lots of sleep.

2135
01:49:10.297 --> 01:49:11.882
I'll get this.

2136
01:49:11.965 --> 01:49:13.884
I insist.

2137
01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.553
Roderick.

2138
01:49:23.349 --> 01:49:24.391
Do you mind?

2139
01:49:26.060 --> 01:49:27.561
What, do you want me
to take two,

2140
01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:29.562
in case the first one
doesn't do the trick?

2141
01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:30.647
No!

2142
01:49:33.607 --> 01:49:37.027
I was just thinking,
since we're together...

2143
01:49:38.985 --> 01:49:42.239
while I'm putting one
in your mouth, you could...

2144
01:49:42.321 --> 01:49:44.031
put one...

2145
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:47.910
Oh.

2146
01:49:47.992 --> 01:49:50.703
You-
You sure about this?

2147
01:49:50.786 --> 01:49:51.912
Yeah.

2148
01:49:51.995 --> 01:49:52.996
You know, I'm not gonna lie.

2149
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.873
I'm a little flattered.

2150
01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:59.835
You should be.

2151
01:50:01.044 --> 01:50:02.045
Go back to my room?

2152
01:50:03.087 --> 01:50:04.171
Oh, no, no, no.

2153
01:50:04.255 --> 01:50:06.131
Not that room.

2154
01:50:07.131 --> 01:50:08.675
A different room.

2155
01:50:12.427 --> 01:50:13.887
Yeah.

2156
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:00.213
So that's it.

2157
01:51:00.297 --> 01:51:02.591
The end of my story.

2158
01:51:02.673 --> 01:51:05.676
Well, one of my stories.

2159
01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:06.677
Mommy! Daddy!

2160
01:51:06.759 --> 01:51:09.429
I found a totato for the picnic!

2161
01:51:09.512 --> 01:51:11.848
- A totato!
- Totat-

2162
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:14.892
Boy, you really are
the farmer in the family.

2163
01:51:14.974 --> 01:51:17.059
- That's-
- Let's see that.

2164
01:51:17.143 --> 01:51:19.437
I think I know what
we're having for the picnic!

2165
01:51:19.519 --> 01:51:21.104
Make some totato soup!

2166
01:51:21.188 --> 01:51:23.356
Buddy, what do you think?
That sound good?

2167
01:51:23.439 --> 01:51:25.941
The story of how I settled down,

2168
01:51:26.025 --> 01:51:27.193
how I met my wife.

2169
01:51:30.028 --> 01:51:31.571
Of how I learned that sometimes,

2170
01:51:31.653 --> 01:51:35.032
what seem to be answers
are really questions in disguise.

2171
01:51:36.365 --> 01:51:37.909
The Machine's list
taught me the who,

2172
01:51:37.992 --> 01:51:40.745
the what, the where,
and the when

2173
01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:43.455
is never as important as the why.

2174
01:51:43.537 --> 01:51:46.123
And the why's not all
that important, either.

2175
01:51:46.206 --> 01:51:50.960
♪ I want to unmake every bed ♪

2176
01:51:51.043 --> 01:51:55.464

♪ That my eyes laid on ♪

2183

If it really is all a game,

2184
01:52:23.609 --> 01:52:25.236
sometimes the best
thing you can do

2185
01:52:25.319 --> 01:52:27.196
is press the reset button.

2186
01:52:28.363 --> 01:52:33.117

For the first time in my life, I am.

2189
01:52:41.081 --> 01:52:43.083
I dare not add an adjective-

2190
01:52:43.165 --> 01:52:46.585
mature, content, happy.

2191
01:52:46.668 --> 01:52:49.170
"I am" is good enough for now.

2192
01:52:50.379 --> 01:52:53.298
Life is a lot like death.

2193
01:52:53.382 --> 01:52:57.135
It happens to everyone,
whether they like it or not.

2194
01:52:57.218 --> 01:52:59.095
The meaning of it all?

2195
01:52:59.177 --> 01:53:01.179
Honestly?

2196
01:53:01.263 --> 01:53:02.639
