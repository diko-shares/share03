1
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:38.074
Who the hell's Roderick Blank?

2
00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.244
That would be me.

3
00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.039
You ever see a guy
walking down the street

4
00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:47.375
looking so happy and content
you wanna find the nearest brick

5
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.044
and turn his face
into hamburger meat?

6
00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.755
I'm sorry. That April morning,
I was that guy.

7
00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.048
I couldn't help it.

8
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:56.050
I had what I thought
at the time to be it all:

9
00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.344
excellent job,
excellent soon-to-be wife,

10
00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.054
excellent life.

11
00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.390
If only I hadn't let Trixie
open that last e-mail.

12
00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:04.976
What would you say if I broke out
into song right now?

13
00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.062
You know how this good mood thing
of yours is killing me, Rod.

14
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.065
And yet... you persist.

15
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:13.067
Stop.

16
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.196
Stop! Or we're never gonna
get through these e-mails.

17
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.657
Oh. Here's a beauty from Lester.

18
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.077
"'Re: Bachelor Party Stripper Crisis."

19
00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.330
Have I told you how grateful I am
that I'm a lesbian?

20
00:03:25.413 --> 00:03:27.248
Delete! Delete!
My God.

21
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.084
Men like Lester are the reason
Death Nell was invented.

22
00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.087
I was a man above temptation.

23
00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.548
Other woman had lost all appeal.

24
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.926
One in particular.

25
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:40.094
They called her Death Nell,

26
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.639
even though, technically,
she hadn't killed anyone.

27
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.807
Different hairstyles,
different outfits,

28
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.268
different spray-painted messages.

29
00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.775
The same comatose result.

30
00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.362
It was all we could
talk about that spring.

31
00:03:57.445 --> 00:04:00.114
Five dates leading
to subversive seduction

32
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:03.117
and ending in endless slumber.

33
00:04:03.201 --> 00:04:04.535
She was the worst thing
to happen to men,

34
00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.079
and the best thing
to happen to media

35
00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.748
in quite some time.

36
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.125
Needless to say, I had
picked the perfect moment

37
00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.002
to be getting out of the game.

38
00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.965
For every guy or gal,
there comes a time

39
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.717
when you say, it's time.

40
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:24.597
Meet Fiona Wormwood,
my wife-to-be.

41
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.849
Stop staring, perv.

42
00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:30.144
It's funny, looking back.

43
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.146
She was not the sweetest girl in the world.

44
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.606
Just, I-- I like-- okay.

45
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.149
But when it comes to
the person you're spending

46
00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:38.152
the rest of your life with,
you want a bit of a sting.

47
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.654
There.

48
00:04:39.737 --> 00:04:42.115
Your married friends
call you up for a barbecue.

49
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:46.577
-They tell you...
- It's time.

50
00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.162
Your parents tell you...

51
00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.581
Son, it's time.

52
00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.793
The whole damn universe tells you.

53
00:04:58.214 --> 00:04:59.924
Don't make me the villain.

54
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.050
I told your sister

55
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.177
exactly how many pounds
she had to drop

56
00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:05.763
to fit into that bridesmaid's dress.

57
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:09.642
Enough.
Let's talk about orchids. Orchids.

58
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.185
Yep. It was time.

59
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.229
Okay, if you can
tear yourself back to work...

60
00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.189
Thank you.
I've downloaded the Big Mac.

61
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:18.192
I mean The Matador!
I don't know.

62
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.236
It looks like two all-beef patties,
special sauce,

63
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.197
lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame seed bun to me.

64
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:24.198
Boss.

65
00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:26.200
Hey, that's very special sauce--

66
00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.662
As for the "excellent job" part of my life,

67
00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.205
I like to tell reporters,

68
00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.832
"It's always been
my dream to work

69
00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.500
in a fast-food restaurant."

70
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:35.877
I was being cute.

71
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.421
Our place was different.
You know...classy.

72
00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:39.964
The plan was simple.

73
00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:42.050
Swallow up the food names,
sleek the uniforms,

74
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.426
Starbuck the decor.

75
00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.511
Welcome to Swallows.

76
00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:47.055
One Swallow Cornucopia to go!

77
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.725
Have a startling and unique day.

78
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:52.226
You, too.

79
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.146
Please, Trixie, tell me that was
the last goddamn e-mail.

80
00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.065
No, there's one more.

81
00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:58.524
Hold on.

82
00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:00.068
Doesn't say who it's from.

83
00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:02.737
I don't know.

84
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.989
I'm getting, like, a virus vibe here.

85
00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.325
Okay! It's your life.

86
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:11.329
Oh, that's weird.

87
00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:14.749
It's a list of names.

88
00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:16.250
Must be more wedding bullshit.

89
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:18.252
Well, they're all women's names.

90
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.214
Number one-- does the name
Patricia Francini ring a bell?

91
00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.757
Patricia Francini?

92
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.717
Whoa, I haven't heard that name in...

93
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.845
Patty and I were co-captains
of my high school debate team,

94
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:29.472
her main claim
to fame being that,

95
00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:31.265
in classic backseat drive-in fashion,

96
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.267
she took my virginity.

97
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.978
Clan of the Cave Bear
was the movie.

98
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.397
Drive-in's now a Staples.

99
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.981
What did you say this list was?

100
00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.733
I didn't, unless Allison Bradbury

101
00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.277
is the second girl
you ever had sex with.

102
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.321
- Whoa.
- No way.

103
00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:48.282
Are you saying this is a list of
everyone you ever had sex with?

104
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:50.034
Who's number three?

105
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.327
Well, that would be Debbie Roberts.

106
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.578
No, wait. She was four.

107
00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.708
Who was the spooky
drunk girl at the 4-H fair?

108
00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.420
I had to drive her home,
'cause her brother was, uh--

109
00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.839
Daisy Milos Ross?

110
00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:04.298
Yes! Crazy Daisy!

111
00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.176
Milos-- what? Ross?

112
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.177
Who sent this?

113
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:09.303
Is this some...

114
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:10.304
pre-bachelor party trick,

115
00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:12.557
of all the girls I've loved before?

116
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.726
But who would know
about Daisy Milos Ross?

117
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.229
Damn, Roderick, this is
an insane amount of pussy.

118
00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.856
Well, thanks.

119
00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.316
I don't know if I'd
call 29 women insane.

120
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.902
I guess some guys might be impressed
by the big two-nine,

121
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.405
but I racked up most of those numbers
as an undergrad.

122
00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.157
Uh, Sparky?

123
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.368
There's more than 29 wild oats
on this list, a lot more.

124
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:36.038
Trix. T. Now, it's not like
I'm one of those silly guys

125
00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:37.457
that keeps track
of how many, uh--

126
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.624
[laughs]
All right. Fine.

127
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.334
Every guy is one
of those silly guys--

128
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.670
Stop! The ever-delightful
Fiona Wormwood,

129
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:45.423
soon to be Fiona Blank,
is indeed numero 29.

130
00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.842
But, dude, the list keeps going.

131
00:07:47.925 --> 00:07:50.344
Closing out at...

132
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.387
a hundred and one.

133
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.222
That's impossible.

134
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.099
Wait. April Fool's Day today, isn't it?

135
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.518
That was yesterday.
Today's the second.

136
00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:59.103
Hmm...

137
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.354
One of the guys.

138
00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:02.356
Zack, Chico, Lester--
no, Lester.

139
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.483
Especially Lester.

140
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:05.067
What better way to mess with me

141
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.402
than by sending me the names of

142
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.404
all the women I've had sex with?

143
00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.157
Teasing me
with an obviously made-up roster.

144
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.367
72 more tantalizing
female names to, uh--

145
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.453
Symbolize all the fine trim you'll be sacrificing

146
00:08:15.536 --> 00:08:16.454
once you get married.

147
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:18.080
Exactly. Yes.

148
00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.081
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.708
Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.461
You sure you don't have
a Carlotta Valdes shacked up somewhere?

151
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.671
I mean, according to the list,
she's next up.

152
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:29.175
Carlotta Valdes.

153
00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:32.970
Followed by Cynthia Rose.

154
00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.263
Followed by--

155
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.390
Well, whoever did this
sure put in the hours.

156
00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:37.433
Print it.

157
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:41.354
Sayonara!

158
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.357
So, now you know.

159
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.026
The last goddamn e-mail.

160
00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:48.903
The list.

161
00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:52.323
Every woman I ever,
followed by every woman I--

162
00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:55.201
You're not still staring at that list.

163
00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.578
No comment.

164
00:08:57.662 --> 00:08:59.539
Oh, did I remember to warn you

165
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:01.832
that you're gonna be kidnapped
from work for your bachelor party?

166
00:09:09.465 --> 00:09:10.550
Whoa!

167
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.802
Hey, Roderick.
How are you doing?

168
00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:16.430
- Ready to party, Rod?
- Oh, no, no.

169
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.683
No one said anything about
this going down at my house.

170
00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:19.684
- Lester.
- What?

171
00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.060
This is my house.

172
00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:22.770
Fiona gave us permission.

173
00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:25.398
Oh, you're insane.

174
00:09:25.481 --> 00:09:27.650
- Interesting e-mail today.
- Mmm!

175
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.443
Worry not.
I found a new stripper.

176
00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:30.695
Oh, no. Not the stripper crisis.

177
00:09:30.778 --> 00:09:33.823
The, uh, kooky one. The list.

178
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.616
- What list?
- The list of--

179
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.951
What are you talking about?

180
00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:39.537
- Names.
- Well, our fair lady's here, gentlemen!

181
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.955
Turn that up!

182
00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:42.707
Rule six.

183
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.459
No ham radio operating.

184
00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:47.461
- Get it? Breasts?
- Aww...

185
00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:49.630
No ham radio operating.

186
00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:52.174
Rule seven.
No checking the oil.

187
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:54.135
- Checking the oil?
- Get it?

188
00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.469
Vagina!

189
00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:57.346
No checking the oil.

190
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:01.350
- And I loved the touch of adding to the list
- Rule eight...

191
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.185
the names of women
I've yet to have sex with.

192
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.771
- No cotton candy.
- What do you mean, man? What list?

193
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.023
Oh. Yeah. "What list?"

194
00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.567
Hey! You two jokers
in the back!

195
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.277
Show Precious some respect!

196
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.486
This is a bachelor party.

197
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.196
It ain't fun and games.

198
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.490
Who wants to play
musical lap dances?

199
00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.517
Aw! Too bad!

200
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:46.020
Goodbye!

201
00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:01.535
Mm. You call this decadence?

202
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.537
Bro, it was you!

203
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.539
If only women knew.
The bachelor party.

204
00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:07.708
The best commercial for marriage.

205
00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.461
Cream for your coffee?

206
00:11:10.544 --> 00:11:13.631
Mm! Uh, no thanks. Carbs.

207
00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:18.552
You laughing at the old coot?

208
00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.513
Yeah, I'm sorry. I am.

209
00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:21.555
Hey, what about you?

210
00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:23.265
You're walking around
your own party, here,

211
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.559
obsessing about
your former conquests.

212
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:27.019
Well, it's actually
a little more complicated.

213
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.187
I was fine until this morning.

214
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.897
I got this crazy list of women--

215
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.274
No! No! No!
I don't wanna see it.

216
00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:33.734
You don't wanna see it.

217
00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.986
Hell, you probably sent it
to yourself when you were drunk.

218
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.489
If you're looking for a way out...

219
00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:40.574
Rod, you'll find it.

220
00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.576
No, it-- it's nothing like that.

221
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.994
Stop looking.

222
00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:45.538
Hang in here for another hour.

223
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.081
Get married next week.
Have a kid.

224
00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:49.583
Reinvent the tater tot! Make a lot
of money! Have another kid.

225
00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:52.086
- Say, "Thanks, Zack."
- Okay. Thanks, Zack.

226
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.963
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe you're right.

227
00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:56.632
Yo! Groom.

228
00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.592
Grand finale.

229
00:11:58.676 --> 00:12:01.262
Don't worry.
Lester's paid for it.

230
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:03.472
Yikes.

231
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.016
How's that for
ham radio, buddy?

232
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.810
Yeah!

233
00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.229
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

234
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:12.398
Give it to me, big boy!

235
00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:13.774
Oh, that's the way you like it?

236
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.318
Oh, yeah! Harder!

237
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.612
This is my oldest. He's four.

238
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.948
- Fuck me!
- This is your oldest?

239
00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.408
Wow. He's a good-looking kid.

240
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.784
He's gonna break a lot of hearts.

241
00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:26.078
Yes! Yes!

242
00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:28.622
- Yes!
- Goddammit! Harder!

243
00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:30.458
So are you planning on
having kids with your wife?

244
00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:31.542
Well, definitely. Yeah.

245
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.836
But you know, right now, we can't even
agree on what kind of dog to--

246
00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.588
Whoa! Precious,
I told you I don't want

247
00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:37.006
to cross the line of--

248
00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.632
Whoa!

249
00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.092
Oh, gosh.

250
00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.677
I'm so sorry.

251
00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.512
I honestly thought
you were kidding about

252
00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:45.473
all that "men can be feminists, too" stuff.

253
00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.517
Can you blame me for the confusion?

254
00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:49.727
Well, just because I'm giving you

255
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.312
a standing ovation, my darling,

256
00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:53.731
doesn't mean that we
have to, you know-- I--

257
00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.775
- I think we better--
- Got it.

258
00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.651
That's what I'm talking about.
Doin' it--

259
00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.446
Hey, I don't want you to take
any of this personally.

260
00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:01.781
I just-- you know.

261
00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.658
Goddamn, what kind
of condom is this?

262
00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:05.910
Your fiancée is lucky.

263
00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.620
She's got one of the good ones.

264
00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:09.497
I wish I was more into
successful white dudes,

265
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.748
but, um--

266
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.708
two broke Latin husbands, and--

267
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.126
Jesus, stop me.

268
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.754
Anyway, man, gracias.
Seriously.

269
00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.172
Gracias?

270
00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:21.300
Um, Precious, your real name

271
00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:24.136
wouldn't happen to be Carlotta...

272
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.139
Valdes?

273
00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:28.390
How did y--

274
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.267
Who told you that?

275
00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.437
Um, I think your bodyguard
might have mentioned it.

276
00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.690
Like that asshole
knows my real name.

277
00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:40.110
So, you staying back there, or...

278
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:42.947
Why is it so quiet in there?

279
00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:46.784
Carlotta Valdes.

280
00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.452
Number 30.

281
00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:51.705
This was more than
a bachelor party trick,

282
00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:54.416
more than a loyalty test.

283
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.293
This was sex.

284
00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.379
And I had a print-out.

285
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:02.508
I was in the throes of
a sacrilegious epiphany,

286
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:05.135
in possession of
a magical document

287
00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.097
that promised
an embarrassment of bitches.

288
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.932
And yet, did it
void my earlier,

289
00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.601
rather impassioned soliloquy
about how it's time?

290
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.728
To settle down?
To marry Fiona?

291
00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:17.273
Right then, I nobly revowed

292
00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.066
my eternal resistance
to other women.

293
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.151
Remember how freaked out you were
when you first noticed

294
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:23.904
the centerfold was
younger than you?

295
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.740
Ah, yes, the...

296
00:14:26.824 --> 00:14:29.493
central trauma of
every American male.

297
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:32.496
Look at this baby.

298
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.748
And I mean baby.

299
00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:39.295
Born in 1984. 1984.

300
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.755
My life was, like, done by '84.

301
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:45.217
- What are her turn-ons?
- Mmm....

302
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:48.095
Pudding, air hockey,
and pudding.

303
00:14:48.178 --> 00:14:51.181
Bimbo said "pudding" twice.

304
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:55.019
I do like air hockey.

305
00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.771
"Cynthia Rose is
looking for a man

306
00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:01.775
who's confident, successful,
with a nice set of abs."

307
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:04.278
Well, zero out of three ain't bad.

308
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.405
What did you say her name was?

309
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.951
Cynthia Rose.

310
00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.161
Nice.

311
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.749
Oh...

312
00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.042
Thank you.

313
00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:20.794
Dude, you're not
gonna buy the issue?

314
00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.471
You look like a Carl.
Can I call you Carl?

315
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:32.222
You talking to me?

316
00:15:32.306 --> 00:15:35.809
You ever fantasize
about escaping, Carl?

317
00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:37.728
Escaping this land,

318
00:15:37.811 --> 00:15:40.314
this magical land
of the newsstand,

319
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:43.400
where all the girls
are right about

320
00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:46.904
to pull off their panties,
but they never quite do.

321
00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.824
Must be kind of frustrating.

322
00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.826
Look, if you don't like
the merchandise, babe,

323
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:54.119
pssht!

324
00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.666
Found this on
your dashboard.

325
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.002
It's a unique color.

326
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:05.381
Kinda like the one
the Parkside Peeper wears.

327
00:16:06.548 --> 00:16:08.384
Wait. Uh...

328
00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:10.302
Look, I have a disease.

329
00:16:10.386 --> 00:16:11.804
- Okay?
- Okay.

330
00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.847
And you could say that
I, too, am a victim,

331
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:15.599
- because--
- Hey! No. Carl.

332
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:17.559
Don't get me wrong.

333
00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:18.936
I think it's kinda hot.

334
00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:22.940
I mean, how would I know
you were watching

335
00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:26.068
if I wasn't watching you?

336
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.863
Wha-- You've been
peeping on me peeping?

337
00:16:29.947 --> 00:16:31.740
Mm-hmm.

338
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.034
Oh. That is hot.

339
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.869
Wait, I c--

340
00:16:35.953 --> 00:16:37.079
I can't tell if you're playing

341
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.790
some feminazi mindfuck game on me

342
00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:42.668
or if you're really trying to seduce me.

343
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:47.965
Well, Carl, why don't we go back
to my hotel and find out?

344
00:16:49.216 --> 00:16:51.969
Pussy is da' bomb. No?

345
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.472
This is a joke, right?

346
00:16:57.141 --> 00:17:00.102
Ten seconds on
the shot clock, Kobe.

347
00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.898
Come on! I--

348
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.276
- This stuff only happens in the movies--
- Five--

349
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.070
I'm the only one
working this shift, I--

350
00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:11.655
Get out of here.

351
00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:13.907
Are you gay?

352
00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.119
Are you impotent?

353
00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:19.580
Or are you just chicken?

354
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.763
Honey?

355
00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:36.930
Sweetie, look.

356
00:17:37.014 --> 00:17:38.932
Your tuxedo.

357
00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.149
- Rod?
- Perhaps it wasn't

358
00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.359
time after all.

359
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.737
Don't worry, I didn't cancel
the wedding or anything.

360
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.447
I'm not an asshole.

361
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.492
I needed to figure things out.

362
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.827
Of course, I didn't
bring up number 31,

363
00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:01.163
Cynthia "Miss April" Rose.

364
00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.957
I stuck to the basics.

365
00:18:04.041 --> 00:18:06.960
"It's not you, it's me."

366
00:18:07.044 --> 00:18:09.088
"I don't want to get married
just to get married."

367
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:12.549
I think I even threw in
a "things have been crazy at work."

368
00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.803
Fiona took it well... too well.

369
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:20.557
I think my sweetie has
a little case of cold feet.

370
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.975
You're nervous.

371
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.435
I'd be scared if you weren't.

372
00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.853
It's more than that, Fi.

373
00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.982
I said, I think my sweetie
has a little case of cold feet.

374
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.192
You're nervous.

375
00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.735
I'd be scared if you weren't.

376
00:18:31.819 --> 00:18:32.986
I'm being honest.

377
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.404
We're getting married
in 11 days, Roderick.

378
00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.990
We are past the point of honesty.

379
00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:38.992
We have a goddamn church booked.

380
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.578
Deposits...

381
00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:42.955
orchids.

382
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:44.289
And you drop this
on me right now

383
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:45.958
before I'm about
to get on a plane

384
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:48.752
to go away with the girls
to a spa for the weekend,

385
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:50.629
you goddamn son of a--

386
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.133
Orchids...

387
00:18:57.094 --> 00:19:00.097
It was one thing to upheave my own life,

388
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.224
but to break the heart of another

389
00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.476
was too much for me.

390
00:19:05.811 --> 00:19:07.813
I told Fiona what
she needed to hear

391
00:19:07.896 --> 00:19:11.191
and provided
the requisite snuggles.

392
00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:13.318
That's when I saw it.

393
00:19:15.195 --> 00:19:17.030
No, not that.

394
00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.699
This.

395
00:19:18.782 --> 00:19:20.993
Pardon my fucking French,

396
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:23.495
but we're talking about
a fucking centerfold here.

397
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:26.248
Fucking a fucking
centerfold, if you will.

398
00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:28.458
And believe me, I will.

399
00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:32.671
Last fling like this, I'll never have to look
at another woman again, right?

400
00:19:32.754 --> 00:19:33.922
Right?

401
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.897
Back of the line, bro.

402
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.154
Okay, gentlemen, don't rush.

403
00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:02.743
Get out of the way,
will you?

404
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.914
- Don't push! Get out of my way!
- Come on, man!

405
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:10.834
Hey, stay in line, please.

406
00:20:10.918 --> 00:20:12.169
I know how to play air hockey!

407
00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:13.629
You each get a chance.

408
00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:30.103
Fiona.

409
00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:33.482
Hey, Fi...

410
00:20:33.565 --> 00:20:34.942
you're probably
already on the plane.

411
00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.111
I just wanted to apologize
again for this morning.

412
00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.697
I don't know what's
going through my head.

413
00:20:40.781 --> 00:20:42.282
- I just--
- Is that your car?

414
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.786
Bad connection. Yeah.

415
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.581
The geeks are revolting.
Like, literally.

416
00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.083
My name's Cynthia Rose.

417
00:20:51.166 --> 00:20:52.918
- You can call me Cyn.
- Okay.

418
00:20:56.922 --> 00:20:58.215
The guy was so serious.

419
00:20:58.298 --> 00:20:59.841
"You must be
so proud of those."

420
00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:01.927
I was like,
"Dude, they're my breasts,

421
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.178
they're not my S.A.T. scores."

422
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.764
So, I thought if I flashed him
he'd shut up,

423
00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:08.141
but who knew the whole store
would flip out?

424
00:21:08.225 --> 00:21:09.393
I'm sorry, I forgot.

425
00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.395
How long did you say
you've been living on this planet?

426
00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:15.440
Coffee became cocktails,

427
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:19.236
cocktails became dinner,
and dinner became...

428
00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:21.905
You guessed it.

429
00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:24.366
Air hockey.

430
00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.743
Darn it!

431
00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:28.036
I thought your centerfold

432
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.746
said air hockey was your game.

433
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.416
Are you always this
suave and arrogant?

434
00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:35.836
Well, it's only two
of my many adjectives.

435
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.421
I can't believe
I'm talking like this.

436
00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:39.923
I'm getting married
in less than two weeks.

437
00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:44.177
My fiance is doing this
bachelorette spa thing this weekend--

438
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.178
Wait a minute,
you're getting married?

439
00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:46.305
Yep.

440
00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.181
Well, why didn't you say so?

441
00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:51.143
That changes everything!

442
00:21:51.226 --> 00:21:52.519
How would you like
to do me a favor?

443
00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:54.688
A favor?
What kind of fav--

444
00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:58.942
Don't worry.
It'll end in sex.

445
00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:02.195
Yes, number 31, Cynthia Rose.

446
00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:04.573
You know this is the most
maniacal shit ever, right?

447
00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.909
Trix, I'm sure there's some
logical explanation for all this.

448
00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:10.996
I'm not going to
wait around for it.

449
00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.289
Keys?

450
00:22:14.041 --> 00:22:15.417
Cynthia Rose wanted to bring

451
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.003
a presentable man
home to Daddy.

452
00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:21.548
The favor would last
another 24 hours.

453
00:22:21.631 --> 00:22:24.009
Meeting another father
under the guise of boyfriend

454
00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:26.511
felt more like cheating
than the cheating.

455
00:22:26.595 --> 00:22:30.891
But as paper beats rock,
desire beats guilt.

456
00:22:30.974 --> 00:22:32.893
Desire beats everything.

457
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.519
I just said that I like baking,

458
00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:37.230
and the next day, the centerfold
family came up with this concept.

459
00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.232
It was like
a built-in kitchen set

460
00:22:39.316 --> 00:22:40.233
with this apron that--

461
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:42.235
Don't abuse the word "family".

462
00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.612
You know as well as I do,

463
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.030
they're just making you
an accomplice

464
00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:46.698
in your own exploitation.

465
00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.241
Well, that's better than
not being an accomplice

466
00:22:48.325 --> 00:22:50.243
in my own exploitation.

467
00:22:50.327 --> 00:22:53.205
You asked me what makes a man,
Roderick, and I'm going to tell you.

468
00:22:53.288 --> 00:22:56.416
Actually, I hadn't asked.

469
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.044
But there was no stopping Victor Rose III.

470
00:22:59.127 --> 00:23:01.797
Yes, her father
was the Victor Rose,

471
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.257
entrepreneur extraordinaire.

472
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.258
Getting to have sex tonight

473
00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:06.676
was going to be more complicated

474
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.844
than I could ever imagine.

475
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:09.721
My parents believed in tradition,

476
00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:12.724
honor, dignity, faith, and free trade,

477
00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:16.103
and separate bedrooms for couples
that are not married.

478
00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:20.524
A toast to the fiery Rose family.

479
00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:22.275
May you--

480
00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.152
Sorry, Roderick.

481
00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:26.154
Every family has
a sick grandmother,

482
00:23:26.238 --> 00:23:28.031
and Granny C just happens to be

483
00:23:28.115 --> 00:23:29.991
really old and really scary.

484
00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.285
Stop! Mother deserves
some respect,

485
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:33.829
not to be treated like a leper.

486
00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:37.082
Despite her grotesque skin disease.

487
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:43.130
Dessert, Roderick?

488
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:45.298
Are you decent?

489
00:23:45.382 --> 00:23:47.384
Absolutely!

490
00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:52.139
Dessert, Roderick?

491
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:56.726
Oh. Uh...

492
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.520
You asked if I was decent.
You didn't ask if--

493
00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:02.023
Yes, my roommate in college
always used to do that gag.

494
00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:03.316
It plays better with you.

495
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.317
Lots.

496
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:07.070
Believe it or not,
you did pretty good tonight.

497
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.363
Great.

498
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.157
That old bear down the hall

499
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.409
is going to be simply crushed
when we break up.

500
00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:14.619
You know, your father
seems pretty serious

501
00:24:14.703 --> 00:24:17.080
about the separate bedroom edict.

502
00:24:17.164 --> 00:24:20.584
The greater the danger,
the greater the thrill.

503
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.752
That's what I say.

504
00:24:22.836 --> 00:24:24.546
Give me five minutes.

505
00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.090
I'm two doors down to the left.

506
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:29.759
Some guys have this annoying habit
of stopping to ask me

507
00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:32.345
if they're boinking me too hard.

508
00:24:32.429 --> 00:24:35.056
Don't ask and don't stop.

509
00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:38.226
Foreplay's for losers.

510
00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.062
Hmm.

511
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:43.190
Better make that three minutes.

512
00:24:43.273 --> 00:24:44.858
Yeah.

513
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:30.487
Oh...yes.

514
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:34.491
What's going on in there?

515
00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:49.005
Ooh, who died?

516
00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:51.841
It's all right, Roderick.

517
00:25:51.925 --> 00:25:54.469
Mother prayed for
this day many times.

518
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:57.055
She's at peace now.

519
00:25:57.138 --> 00:25:59.432
She can keep my son company.

520
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.601
Say hello to Vic, Jr., Mommy!

521
00:26:01.685 --> 00:26:06.314
Cyn. Sir, I'm so sorry.

522
00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:08.525
- You must really--
- Yeah, whatever.

523
00:26:08.608 --> 00:26:10.860
She was ancient
and my brother was a jerk.

524
00:26:10.944 --> 00:26:12.862
What was with you last night?

525
00:26:12.946 --> 00:26:14.072
Why didn't you come?

526
00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:15.448
Come?

527
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.866
With your father
barging in like that,

528
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:18.201
didn't really leave a lot of time

529
00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:20.328
for either one of us
to hit the jackpot.

530
00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.122
You know, as they say,

531
00:26:22.205 --> 00:26:23.331
if at first you don't succeed,

532
00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.458
try, try again.

533
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:26.376
What are you talking about?

534
00:26:26.459 --> 00:26:27.752
Why didn't you come to my room?

535
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:28.962
I didn't see you at all.

536
00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:30.297
I guess it was
pretty dark, but--

537
00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.673
Mother had the strangest,

538
00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.717
sweetest, little smile on her face.

539
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.802
I'm convinced that her last moments

540
00:26:35.885 --> 00:26:38.597
on this mortal coil
were ones of pleasure.

541
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.474
When you said
two doors to the left,

542
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:43.393
did you mean
your left or my left?

543
00:26:43.476 --> 00:26:45.061
What are you talking--

544
00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:48.148
I don't know, I guess
it was my left. Why?

545
00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:54.446
Granny C happens to be
really old and...

546
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:57.616
C. as in Cynthia,
as in Cynthia Rose,

547
00:26:57.699 --> 00:26:59.492
as in number 31 on your list,

548
00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:02.537
as in there's more than one, dipshit!

549
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.706
You fucked my mother!

550
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:24.017
And if you were to put
your hand on the bun...

551
00:27:25.894 --> 00:27:28.480
I raced home to tell Fiona everything.

552
00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:29.856
Okay, not everything.

553
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:31.232
Not anything.

554
00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:32.859
What woman, a week
before her wedding,

555
00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:35.111
wants to hear about
some crazy list of women?

556
00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:37.280
Not to mention, I mean
really not to mention,

557
00:27:37.364 --> 00:27:38.698
her future husband's involvement

558
00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:40.825
with an 88-year-old leper.

559
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:43.536
I was sure Fiona would
take me into her arms.

560
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.706
- Honey, I'm home!
- Instead, she just took.

561
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.750
I never liked this couch.

562
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.502
Fi?

563
00:27:57.384 --> 00:27:58.802
Fiona, what have you done?

564
00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:01.805
- Why are you--
- You're getting off easy and you know it.

565
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.518
I don't understand.
I adore you.

566
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:08.144
I want to make you my wife.

567
00:28:08.228 --> 00:28:12.482
It's like you've got
this lost, far-away look,

568
00:28:12.565 --> 00:28:14.776
like you're thinking about
the hundreds of other women

569
00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:16.736
you plan to sleep with
before you die.

570
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.571
Hundreds?

571
00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:19.823
70 at most.

572
00:28:19.906 --> 00:28:21.116
Keep going.

573
00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:25.453
You're the guy
who notices haircuts.

574
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.456
- You never forget Valentine's Day.
- No.

575
00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.209
You always have the right,
supportive thing to say,

576
00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:33.628
even if you don't mean it.

577
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:39.551
You're not some evil,
sexist jerk, Rod.

578
00:28:39.634 --> 00:28:42.429
So who are you?

579
00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:44.264
I am someone that will
love and support you--

580
00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:45.890
Oh.

581
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.602
It's not an oral exam.

582
00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:55.150
I'm going to get up
off this couch now.

583
00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:58.486
I'm going to walk to the door.

584
00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:03.950
Do I want you to stop me?

585
00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:07.036
Yes.

586
00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:13.042
Just as my hand is on the knob,

587
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:15.795
I want you to tackle me

588
00:29:15.879 --> 00:29:20.550
and hold me and tell me
that you can never let me go,

589
00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.844
while tears stream
down both our faces.

590
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:26.973
But you better mean it, Rod.

591
00:29:27.056 --> 00:29:30.226
Because right now,

592
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.519
you're just one
of the bigger mistakes

593
00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.521
I've ever made.

594
00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:37.150
But if you convince me to stay,

595
00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:43.156
and you can't back it up
with every inch of your soul,

596
00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:45.533
then you will be a true villain.

597
00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.338
- Good call, buddy!
- Ah!

598
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:59.839
You made the right
decision, Mr. Blank,

599
00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:01.716
but it's not like
you had much of a choice.

600
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.259
Whoo!

601
00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:08.765
Okay, what's happening?

602
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:12.894
Where am I?

603
00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.729
Who are you people?

604
00:30:14.813 --> 00:30:16.189
Hello, Mr. Blank.

605
00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:18.817
I'm Alpha, he's Beta,

606
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.527
and that's Fred.

607
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:23.488
We're here to tell you everything, Mr. Blank.

608
00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:24.739
This isn't a dream,

609
00:30:24.823 --> 00:30:27.116
and it isn't a dream
within a dream, either.

610
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.701
You're not going
to wake up at the end,

611
00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:31.579
and I'm your gardener
and these are your pool boys.

612
00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.748
This is about the list, isn't it?

613
00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.125
Of course it's about the list!

614
00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:38.002
You must be freaking out.

615
00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:40.421
Seriously, what number
are you at right now--

616
00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.840
Down, Fred.

617
00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:46.719
Mr. Blank...

618
00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:48.429
some people you don't know

619
00:30:48.513 --> 00:30:49.597
found some things you don't know

620
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.850
in a place you don't know.

621
00:30:51.933 --> 00:30:55.228
And these things have been
very useful in making a new thing.

622
00:30:55.311 --> 00:30:57.355
One that apparently
knows everything.

623
00:30:58.356 --> 00:30:59.858
A thing that knows everything,

624
00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:05.238
like a computer, a supercomputer.

625
00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:08.908
I prefer the word "machine."

626
00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:11.953
Now, this machine will take
a few lifetimes to figure out,

627
00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:14.706
and I wouldn't go as far
as to call it an oracle,

628
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:18.293
but it is...oraclesque.

629
00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:21.921
Last week, it sent out
about 2,900 e-mails,

630
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:24.132
answers to questions nobody asked--

631
00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:27.594
not us, not the e-mail recipients.

632
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:31.222
Almost everyone received nothing more
than an individual date--

633
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:35.268
day, month, year.

634
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:37.353
You're very lucky you didn't
get that one, Mr. Blank.

635
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:40.356
It was the day
of the recipient's death.

636
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.817
But then there's you.

637
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.570
Yes, a few of the e-mails

638
00:31:45.653 --> 00:31:47.780
drew an unnatural
attention to themselves.

639
00:31:47.864 --> 00:31:52.160
Well, yeah, but yours
is the best, far and away.

640
00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:55.914
A list of everyone you're
going to have sex with?

641
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:58.666
Oh man, this other poor dick
got the same list.

642
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.918
One name!

643
00:32:00.001 --> 00:32:03.296
The wife that he lost
his virginity to.

644
00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:04.297
What a sap!

645
00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.423
- Fred--
- I mean, can you imagine?

646
00:32:05.506 --> 00:32:07.383
Fred!

647
00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:11.971
Mr. Blank, I think you know
where I'm going with this.

648
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.725
If people were to find out
about the machine,

649
00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:17.810
it would cause panic
and confusion and--

650
00:32:17.894 --> 00:32:19.520
You're threatening me?

651
00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:23.983
Not to be a smart-ass.

652
00:32:24.067 --> 00:32:27.820
If your little oracle is for real,

653
00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:29.656
then I can't die
before bedding down

654
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.950
the last lady on the list.

655
00:32:33.368 --> 00:32:35.662
Grand to finally
meet you, Mr. Blank.

656
00:32:35.745 --> 00:32:37.705
The door is at
the end of the hall.

657
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:40.333
Yeah, and if you
have any questions,

658
00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.543
drop in any time, bro.

659
00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.422
Can't believe
I believe all this.

660
00:32:46.506 --> 00:32:49.092
But you do,
and we appreciate it.

661
00:32:49.175 --> 00:32:52.220
You've been guaranteed
a robust sex life, Mr. Blank.

662
00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.055
That should be enough for you.

663
00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.556
Lose the list.

664
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.518
Burn it, bury it,
whatever you need to do.

665
00:32:58.601 --> 00:33:00.269
If you let the list in your life,

666
00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:04.232
it will infect
every fiber of your being.

667
00:33:05.942 --> 00:33:06.901
Bye-bye.

668
00:33:23.459 --> 00:33:25.753
I like him.

669
00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:27.922
He seems sensible.

670
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:31.384
Hey, hey, uh, almighty, all-knowing guys?

671
00:33:31.467 --> 00:33:36.347
You just confirmed the validity
of a list of 101 sure things.

672
00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:41.144
Okay? So, a list like that,
doesn't get burned or buried.

673
00:33:41.227 --> 00:33:42.603
It gets used.

674
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:47.191
And I mean, it gets, like,
crazy-montage-sequence used.

675
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:49.902
"French-New Wave,
learning Gymkata,

676
00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:52.321
I can't believe they could afford
that song" montage.

677
00:33:52.405 --> 00:33:54.657
It's gonna be fucking nuts!

678
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:55.992
He's just--

679
00:33:56.075 --> 00:34:01.372
He's going to fuck a lot.

680
00:34:26.689 --> 00:34:30.860
* I'm surrounded softly *

681
00:34:30.943 --> 00:34:33.362
* By the beat *

682
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:36.824
* Still dumbfounded *

683
00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:42.830
* By the intolerable heat *

684
00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:46.918
* You came close to me *

685
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:49.837
* And you danced *

686
00:34:51.297 --> 00:34:54.801
* It came close to *

687
00:34:54.884 --> 00:34:59.555
* Being my last *

688
00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:02.225
* I'll take what's mine *

689
00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:06.979
* Before I regret it *

690
00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:09.357
I'm saving that seat
for a friend.

691
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.399
What's your name?

692
00:35:10.483 --> 00:35:13.361
Kathleen, Mr. Manners.

693
00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.863
- That's a shame.
- What did you say?

694
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.366
Oh, I said, it's a nice name.

695
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:19.992
Roderick Blank.

696
00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:22.453
Ooh, first and last names,
how formal.

697
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:24.747
- Well...
- Ah.

698
00:35:24.831 --> 00:35:29.043
Here's my standing up friend
and colleague Greta Sampsa.

699
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.003
This is the guy who took your seat.

700
00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:34.215
Greta Sampsa, now that's
a fantastic name.

701
00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.341
What would you like?

702
00:35:35.424 --> 00:35:37.510
A slow, nasty fuck
on the coffee table.

703
00:35:37.593 --> 00:35:39.470
Would you like that
with Bacardi or Myer's?

704
00:35:39.554 --> 00:35:42.014
Bacardi.

705
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:44.976
Did you know I was
talking about a drink?

706
00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:47.061
Maybe, maybe not.

707
00:35:49.772 --> 00:35:53.943
* I'll take what's mine before I... *

708
00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:55.862
This your only piece of ID?

709
00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:56.988
You swear you're
not named after

710
00:35:57.071 --> 00:35:58.656
anyone else in your family?

711
00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:00.700
Listen, you're cute and I'm drunk,

712
00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:02.618
and my plane is grounded
until tomorrow,

713
00:36:02.702 --> 00:36:03.828
but if you want to--

714
00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:06.581
* I'll take what's mine *

715
00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:09.417
* Before I... *

716
00:36:15.715 --> 00:36:17.758
Noreen!

717
00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:25.057
Leslie and Yuca!

718
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:28.269
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Bill.

719
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.438
Enjoy.

720
00:36:32.064 --> 00:36:33.274
Julie!

721
00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.859
* You're having my sex *

722
00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:36.527
* You're sleeping with my wife *

723
00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:40.072
* You're having my kids
and the time of my life *

724
00:36:40.156 --> 00:36:41.532
* You're writing my book *

725
00:36:41.616 --> 00:36:43.367
* You're starring in my film *

726
00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:47.246
* You have the number one
and my number ten *

727
00:36:49.582 --> 00:36:52.793
* We could be such
very good friends *

728
00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.129
* If you let me in *

729
00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:59.508
* The higher the gates,
the longer the wait *

730
00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:02.595
* Please let this poor boy sin *

731
00:37:02.678 --> 00:37:04.347
* You're having my sex *

732
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:06.015
* You're sleeping with my wife *

733
00:37:06.098 --> 00:37:09.143
* You're having my kids
and the time of my life *

734
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.229
* You're writing my book *

735
00:37:11.312 --> 00:37:13.773
* You're starring in my film *

736
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:17.109
I'd say that
I was mature and content.

737
00:37:17.193 --> 00:37:19.278
But if you have to say
that stuff out loud,

738
00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:21.113
it can't possibly be true.

739
00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:23.574
I thought I was above
all the hot chicks,

740
00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:26.244
high-five,
beer-commercial bullshit.

741
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:28.704
I was above nothing.

742
00:37:30.957 --> 00:37:32.667
The list was life.

743
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.460
Have a startling and unique day,

744
00:37:34.543 --> 00:37:37.213
- Mr. Blank.
- Thank you.

745
00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:41.259
Wait a second,
how did you know my name?

746
00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:44.178
Swallows is the case study
in my business class.

747
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.013
I thought I'd get some first-hand experience

748
00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.640
and make a little money
at the same time.

749
00:37:47.723 --> 00:37:48.641
Very little money.

750
00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:51.519
That's fascinating...

751
00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:53.020
Alexis.

752
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.106
Alexis de Large.

753
00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:56.524
Wait a minute.

754
00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:57.942
How did you know my last name?

755
00:37:58.025 --> 00:38:00.069
Yeah, yeah!

756
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.487
That's the way you like it.

757
00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.864
Well, yes, I find
the honey mustard sauce

758
00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.450
really brings out the flavor.

759
00:38:06.534 --> 00:38:07.618
Pull my hair.

760
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.703
What?

761
00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.121
Up to the window.

762
00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:16.043
Have a startling
and u-- u-- u--

763
00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:18.170
Is it too late
to squeeze in a cherry pie?

764
00:38:24.093 --> 00:38:25.261
April to August,

765
00:38:25.344 --> 00:38:28.347
I went from number 29
to number 62.

766
00:38:28.431 --> 00:38:30.725
Maybe I was moving too fast.

767
00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:33.060
But then, I guess
I was supposed to.

768
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.897
I crossed out the names,
but remembered the faces.

769
00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:40.192
Their stare, my stare.

770
00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:43.029
We think if we exchange
the meaningful stare,

771
00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:45.197
the meaning will kick in later.

772
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.991
But does it?

773
00:38:47.074 --> 00:38:49.243
One or both of you
try to say something like,

774
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.953
"It's just sex."

775
00:38:51.037 --> 00:38:52.038
But is it?

776
00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:55.207
You think sending me
a bunch of roses

777
00:38:55.291 --> 00:38:57.001
is going to make me--

778
00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:58.753
You think paying my car insurance

779
00:38:58.878 --> 00:39:00.921
is going to make me forget that you cheat--

780
00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.423
A stuffed animal?

781
00:39:02.506 --> 00:39:04.717
I overheard a waitress say
you paid off her car ins--

782
00:39:06.135 --> 00:39:07.261
Earth to Roderick Blank!

783
00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.888
Stop having hot sex.

784
00:39:08.971 --> 00:39:11.223
Get your ass up to the house
for a barbeque.

785
00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:13.184
It is my boy Max's birthday.

786
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:15.478
Or my son Kyle. Be here!

787
00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:26.489
When my wedding was canceled,

788
00:39:26.572 --> 00:39:29.867
there had been a chill
among the married folk.

789
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.161
You'd have thought
I'd left them at the altar.

790
00:39:32.244 --> 00:39:36.374
But now they kind of
like having me around.

791
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.670
The ladies' man.

792
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:47.218
Lizzie is an amazing
woman, Zack.

793
00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:49.595
I mean, what she's done with that clinic.

794
00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:50.930
The way she's raised
your two kids.

795
00:39:51.013 --> 00:39:52.973
Yeah, yeah, my wife's
a goddamn saint.

796
00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.850
Now, this stewardess,
did she say,

797
00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:58.270
"Come on my ass"
or "Come in my ass?"

798
00:39:58.354 --> 00:40:00.272
Oh, Roderick's definition
of having children

799
00:40:00.356 --> 00:40:02.274
is a little different than ours.

800
00:40:02.358 --> 00:40:04.026
Why raise them
when you can pork them?

801
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.277
Ooh!

802
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.071
Lizzie, how many times
do I have to tell you?

803
00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:08.697
I didn't know
she was your niece.

804
00:40:08.781 --> 00:40:12.827
Besides, she's 19-- and a half.

805
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.496
And I found her to be
very mature for her age.

806
00:40:16.664 --> 00:40:18.332
- Rod!
- So bad.

807
00:40:19.417 --> 00:40:21.919
Husbands, wives,

808
00:40:22.002 --> 00:40:24.505
kids, families.

809
00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.882
It was not just a world
I was supposed to want,

810
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:29.427
it was a world
I genuinely wanted.

811
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.095
What's life without experiencing

812
00:40:31.178 --> 00:40:33.180
the wonder of a child?

813
00:40:34.515 --> 00:40:37.435
- I named my hamster Dog.
- Oh.

814
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:41.063
And when I get a dog, I'm going
to name him after you.

815
00:40:41.147 --> 00:40:44.692
Mr. Butt.

816
00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:52.074
You about ready?

817
00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:56.245
Yeah.

818
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.374
You know,
maybe they're right.

819
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.376
I should lower the old periscope
for a while,

820
00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.878
hold out for someone special.

821
00:41:03.961 --> 00:41:05.045
Special?

822
00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:07.298
If the subject is
cooking or crab grass,

823
00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.049
then you can listen
to married people.

824
00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.468
Come on.

825
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:12.595
You're hitting baskets
from everywhere on the court.

826
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:14.847
This is no time
to go back to the bench.

827
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.599
Hey. I'm Bob.

828
00:41:16.682 --> 00:41:18.309
- Rod, is it?
- Yeah.

829
00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:21.520
My apologies, I just--
I couldn't help overhearing

830
00:41:21.604 --> 00:41:23.898
your good fortune with
the female of the species.

831
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.357
I'm hoping it'll rub off.

832
00:41:25.441 --> 00:41:27.193
And why is that, kind sir?

833
00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:29.487
Oh, funny story.

834
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.405
One morning
about five months ago,

835
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.991
I came to work, and right there
on my computer screen,

836
00:41:34.074 --> 00:41:36.243
a day, a month and a year.

837
00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:38.871
A date. Today's date.

838
00:41:38.954 --> 00:41:41.415
I'm utterly convinced
that it's a sign.

839
00:41:41.499 --> 00:41:43.918
The night that
I'm to meet my soul mate.

840
00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.586
- You had to ask him.
- I've gone as far

841
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.004
as to procure lodgings
down the street

842
00:41:47.087 --> 00:41:48.964
at the Hotel Taboo.

843
00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:51.717
Kind of spicy.

844
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.261
Wait.

845
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.348
You received an unexplained date
as an e-mail?

846
00:41:57.431 --> 00:41:58.516
Yeah.

847
00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:01.268
Your next drink's on me.

848
00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.854
Oh, how very kind of you.

849
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.164
Oh...

850
00:42:30.839 --> 00:42:33.884
I'd like to be the meat
in that fairy sandwich.

851
00:42:33.968 --> 00:42:37.596
So out of your league
in so many ways.

852
00:42:40.015 --> 00:42:43.394
* I need two girls *

853
00:42:43.477 --> 00:42:45.437
* If I can't have you *

854
00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:47.439
Holy lesbo.

855
00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:49.358
Is that Bambi and Thumper?

856
00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:50.985
* I need two girls *

857
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.237
* If I can't have you *

858
00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.322
All right, Trix, they're all yours.

859
00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.323
I'm out.

860
00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:57.950
Where's he--

861
00:42:58.033 --> 00:42:59.577
What league are we
talking about here?

862
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.371
You don't know Bambi Kidd
and Thumper Wint?

863
00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:04.248
The Euro-Prague rock superstar

864
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:06.208
and the British astronaut?

865
00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.377
Rod! The Blog!

866
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.920
The reality show.

867
00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:12.673
The daily streaming video.

868
00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.551
They are the Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

869
00:43:15.634 --> 00:43:17.261
They go from town to town,

870
00:43:17.344 --> 00:43:19.972
mm, raising awareness
on important issues

871
00:43:20.055 --> 00:43:21.890
by empowering young women...

872
00:43:21.974 --> 00:43:23.726
and then seducing them.

873
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:25.436
I'm hoping for an autograph.

874
00:43:27.229 --> 00:43:29.523
Or a three-way.

875
00:43:29.607 --> 00:43:31.567
Oh, back off,
they're looking over here.

876
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:35.779
My friends,
it's not about buying them flowers.

877
00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:39.241
It's not about pretending
to ignore them.

878
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:42.620
It's all about just knowing.

879
00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:45.998
I know, easy for me to say.

880
00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:50.210
Bambi and Thumper, was it?

881
00:43:52.379 --> 00:43:55.090
Bambi and Thumper.

882
00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.469
W-Why are they staring at you?

883
00:43:58.552 --> 00:43:59.762
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

884
00:43:59.845 --> 00:44:01.805
Don't tell me one of them
is on that fucking list.

885
00:44:01.889 --> 00:44:06.560
- That list of fucking--
- No, one of them is not on the list.

886
00:44:13.025 --> 00:44:16.153
But you see, even before the list,

887
00:44:16.236 --> 00:44:18.614
I always knew just knowing

888
00:44:18.697 --> 00:44:22.409
beats any gift, tactic,
or opening line,

889
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.620
no matter what
the sexual orientation.

890
00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:28.207
* If I can't have you *

891
00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:31.543
* One that I can love *

892
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.504
* To have and to hold *

893
00:44:33.587 --> 00:44:34.546
* One for at the club *

894
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:37.466
Wish me luck.

895
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:40.719
I may be coming in late tomorrow.

896
00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:41.804
Rod?

897
00:44:49.895 --> 00:44:52.272
Hey, Rod! Hey!

898
00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:54.525
Hey, I found her!

899
00:44:54.608 --> 00:44:55.859
She's the one!

900
00:44:55.943 --> 00:44:57.945
Can you-- What a night!

901
00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:02.825
What a night, indeed.

902
00:45:02.908 --> 00:45:06.286
Hey, have you thought any more
about my offer, my love?

903
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.539
I mean, yours are nice,
don't get me wrong.

904
00:45:08.622 --> 00:45:10.332
Really, really nice,

905
00:45:10.416 --> 00:45:12.835
but is there really
such a thing as too big?

906
00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:16.922
- Let's just enjoy this moment.
- All right.

907
00:45:17.005 --> 00:45:19.133
Just, you know, with my position
at the company,

908
00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.719
I get a 40% discount on
whatever kind of implant you want.

909
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:22.720
Hey, Bob.

910
00:45:22.803 --> 00:45:25.347
Seriously, enjoy the moment.

911
00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:27.266
Okay. You win.

912
00:45:29.143 --> 00:45:32.730
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

913
00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:36.775
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

914
00:45:36.859 --> 00:45:40.821
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

915
00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:44.700
"My wounds are deeper
than your desires."

916
00:45:45.951 --> 00:45:46.869
Drink?

917
00:45:48.954 --> 00:45:50.914
Don't mind if I do.

918
00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:57.713
Is the gentleman surprised
that he's here?

919
00:45:57.796 --> 00:45:59.006
No, the gentleman is not.

920
00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:01.467
Oh! Did you hear that,
Miss Kidd?

921
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.427
He's very cocky.

922
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.388
Accent on the cock, Miss Wint.

923
00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:11.727
Boy, my assistant
is gonna kill me--

924
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.646
That is so sweet.
He is trying to talk to us.

925
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:19.276
Man-guy, just sign the confidentiality
agreement on the table.

926
00:46:19.359 --> 00:46:20.277
Now.

927
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.280
The kind sir does understand

928
00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:25.991
a vegan doesn't tell her friends

929
00:46:26.074 --> 00:46:29.036
that she just wolfed down
a greasy cheeseburger.

930
00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:34.958
Yes, the kind sir
understands... kind of.

931
00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.669
Bottoms up.

932
00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:28.470
Whoa!

933
00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:31.807
Looks like everyone's having
a good time tonight, huh?

934
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.392
So what do you say
about round two?

935
00:47:33.475 --> 00:47:34.852
I may need a little
in about 30 minutes.

936
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:36.937
And I'd like you to meet
my family, if that's okay.

937
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:38.897
I was thinking, I'm from, uh--

938
00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:43.402
Oh, my God!
Is that paint?

939
00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:45.028
Does that come off?

940
00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:46.238
Wh-- why would you do that?

941
00:47:46.321 --> 00:47:47.781
I put this room
on my credit card.

942
00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:49.908
What are you trying to do,
imitate that disturbed woman

943
00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:51.201
who's going around...

944
00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:53.912
Oh, dear.

945
00:47:55.622 --> 00:47:57.666
What can I say, Bob?

946
00:47:57.749 --> 00:48:00.878
Some dreams are
too true to be good.

947
00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:03.755
Well, I must say,
you're being a real cun--

948
00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:05.716
uh-- I didn't say it--

949
00:48:05.799 --> 00:48:08.176
cunning woman, you are.

950
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.512
That's what I was--
I was g-- help?

951
00:48:10.596 --> 00:48:12.598
Ow! I was faking it!

952
00:48:12.681 --> 00:48:14.474
Don't tell me you
were faking it, Miss Kidd.

953
00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:16.894
I know when you're faking it,
and you did that thing with your toes!

954
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:20.230
- No...
- Bambi, Thumper, please, don't fight.

955
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:21.982
You said you wouldn't
get jealous, Miss Wint!

956
00:48:23.901 --> 00:48:25.736
Okay. Maybe fight
a little more.

957
00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:28.822
This is not about sex!
This is about intimacy!

958
00:48:28.906 --> 00:48:30.032
Real intimacy!

959
00:48:30.115 --> 00:48:31.283
That's it.
Turn the cameras off.

960
00:48:31.366 --> 00:48:32.951
Keep the camera rolling!

961
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:34.870
Cameras? Rolling?

962
00:48:34.953 --> 00:48:37.789
Oh, no, no. No, this is crazy.
You can't film this!

963
00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:40.792
Well, you did know the confidentiality
agreement's really a release form.

964
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:42.044
Haven't you seen our show?

965
00:48:42.127 --> 00:48:45.255
Don't you change
the subject, Star Whore.

966
00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.138
Help me, somebody!
It's her! She's here!

967
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:54.890
I think they're kind of having

968
00:48:54.973 --> 00:48:57.392
some problems of
their own there, Bob.

969
00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:58.727
Please! Just tell me
what you want from me!

970
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:00.604
Why don't you sleep on it, Bob?

971
00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:03.690
Take forever, if you have to.

972
00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:04.816
Don't. Please. Please.

973
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.443
Please wait. Just wait. Wait.

974
00:49:06.526 --> 00:49:07.736
I-- This is not fair.

975
00:49:07.819 --> 00:49:09.655
It's not like I hit you,
or roofied you,

976
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.115
or openly exploited you in--

977
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.493
Oh, this is the breast
implant thing? Okay.

978
00:49:14.576 --> 00:49:15.827
Look, I'm just
the company accountant.

979
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:18.372
I keep the books! Please!

980
00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:21.333
All I need to know is, why?
I deserve a good reason--

981
00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:23.335
Why do men always
get to have reasons?

982
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:26.713
Did you think women get to have
reasons when they get attacked?

983
00:49:26.797 --> 00:49:28.840
I want everyone on red alert here.

984
00:49:28.924 --> 00:49:32.135
Although you do bring up
a legitimate point.

985
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.137
I mean, you're not
Master Bitchslap

986
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:36.390
or the Parkside Peeper.

987
00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.892
Or even that captain
of the lacrosse team, who--

988
00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.143
Whoap!

989
00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.064
Bob?

990
00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:46.441
Oh...Bob.

991
00:49:48.402 --> 00:49:51.488
Aw, pilgrim.

992
00:49:53.448 --> 00:49:55.200
Guess it was just your time.

993
00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.793
Oh, yeah...

994
00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:06.545
What a night.

995
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.057
What time do you have to
be down at the new location?

996
00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:21.184
Trixie?

997
00:50:21.268 --> 00:50:23.186
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

998
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.521
If it makes you feel any better,

999
00:50:24.604 --> 00:50:27.149
it was the most
traumatic night of my--

1000
00:50:27.232 --> 00:50:28.984
Okay, well, it wasn't all bad, but...

1001
00:50:29.067 --> 00:50:31.695
I'm sorry. It's always been a fantasy
to be with two women at once.

1002
00:50:31.778 --> 00:50:35.407
You know, lesbians,
rock stars, astronauts.

1003
00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:36.616
Okay, maybe not astronauts.

1004
00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:39.286
But you know, sexy female
space travelers.

1005
00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:41.079
You're giving the finger
to the intercom box, aren't you?

1006
00:50:41.163 --> 00:50:43.457
I know. I know.

1007
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.042
I lied about 'em
being on the list.

1008
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:47.294
The list. Damn it!

1009
00:50:47.586 --> 00:50:49.337
Don't get me wrong,
a piece of paper that tells me

1010
00:50:49.421 --> 00:50:50.756
whether or not
I'm gonna get lucky,

1011
00:50:50.839 --> 00:50:52.799
you're not gonna say
anything bad about, but...

1012
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:55.218
it's-- it's like...

1013
00:50:55.302 --> 00:50:57.054
watching a tape
of a football game,

1014
00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.013
and you know your team wins.

1015
00:50:58.096 --> 00:50:59.639
It's not unenjoyable,

1016
00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:02.017
but can it really compare
to watching the game live,

1017
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.643
and they're going for it
on the fourth down?

1018
00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:05.604
- And you don't know if--
- Sports metaphors...

1019
00:51:05.687 --> 00:51:07.147
aren't my thing.

1020
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.024
But it sounds like you're going for

1021
00:51:09.107 --> 00:51:10.150
"The thrill of the pursuit

1022
00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:12.027
is more exciting than the conquest."

1023
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:13.028
I can't help it!

1024
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.196
I mean, I see the name,

1025
00:51:14.279 --> 00:51:16.114
I want to find her and meet her,

1026
00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:18.909
so I can cross her out,
and I can get to the next name.

1027
00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.536
I'm not in control
of my own destiny.

1028
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.954
That may be true.

1029
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:24.873
But you're not
supposed to know that!

1030
00:51:24.956 --> 00:51:28.460
You're meddling with
the primal forces of nature.

1031
00:51:28.543 --> 00:51:32.089
I mean, my God.
Am I on the list, too?

1032
00:51:32.172 --> 00:51:33.965
I mean--

1033
00:51:39.179 --> 00:51:40.722
Ah. Whew.

1034
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.101
You got scared
there a little, didn't you?

1035
00:51:44.184 --> 00:51:46.311
- Oh, you were more scared.
- Yes.

1036
00:51:47.104 --> 00:51:48.897
Trixie?

1037
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.690
What if I were meant
to be with these women,

1038
00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.067
no matter what?

1039
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.611
What if you were meant
to bury the list,

1040
00:51:54.694 --> 00:51:56.822
and calm the heck down?

1041
00:51:56.905 --> 00:51:58.323
You know...

1042
00:51:58.406 --> 00:52:02.119
if we bury the list, guess what?

1043
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:05.038
You were meant to bury the list.

1044
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.414
Live your life.

1045
00:52:06.498 --> 00:52:09.751
Whatever happens, happens.

1046
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.297
You know, it's a sheet
of paper, not a body.

1047
00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.634
Sheet of paper, not a body!

1048
00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.346
Yeah. It's time.

1049
00:52:23.306 --> 00:52:25.058
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
- Breathe.

1050
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:26.226
Breathe, Roderick!

1051
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.979
Yeah! Breathe!

1052
00:52:29.062 --> 00:52:31.189
Yes, I have deleted
all remnants of the list

1053
00:52:31.273 --> 00:52:32.816
on my hard drive.

1054
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.569
But remember, oh weak one, we are
putting a tulip to mark this spot.

1055
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.821
If you wuss out, we will dig it up.

1056
00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:39.447
- Wait. One more name?
- Oh, Rod!

1057
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:41.199
Please?

1058
00:52:42.367 --> 00:52:44.327
Couple of letters
I'm gonna give ya.

1059
00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:46.246
Dr. Mir--

1060
00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:49.457
Please, one more letter.

1061
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.710
What's that gonna make?
One letter-- no!

1062
00:52:53.753 --> 00:52:55.839
Don't grab it!

1063
00:52:55.922 --> 00:52:56.882
Mir-- Mir--

1064
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.008
- One more letter!
- That's it!

1065
00:52:58.091 --> 00:52:59.843
We're ready!

1066
00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.222
I'm starting to take
a liking to Trixie.

1067
00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:05.932
I think she's
a very good influence.

1068
00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:07.767
It's not gonna happen, Beta.

1069
00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.604
You can't bury
something that precious.

1070
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:15.817
Death Nell took
her tenth victim last night.

1071
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.152
- Hm?
- That double-digit rule.

1072
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:19.779
When a serial killer
hits ten, we get called.

1073
00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:22.032
We-- Like we don't have
enough on our plate?

1074
00:53:22.115 --> 00:53:23.742
I thought she only did comas!

1075
00:53:23.825 --> 00:53:25.577
Not last night.

1076
00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.912
But on the side of the bright,

1077
00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:29.080
home base says the machine
has taken an interest.

1078
00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:31.875
No way he's really doing it!

1079
00:53:31.958 --> 00:53:33.793
-Ready?
- Quick. Before I change my mind.

1080
00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:37.005
Way to go, Roderick.

1081
00:53:37.088 --> 00:53:38.798
Way to go.

1082
00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:43.845
Rod, you're missing this.

1083
00:53:43.929 --> 00:53:45.263
They crossed into our territory.

1084
00:53:45.347 --> 00:53:46.723
We could lose this.

1085
00:53:46.806 --> 00:53:49.059
I know. Isn't it exciting?

1086
00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:51.061
If we blow it again in their red zone,

1087
00:53:51.144 --> 00:53:52.771
it's gonna leave a bad
taste in my mouth.

1088
00:53:52.854 --> 00:53:54.064
That's what your boyfriend
said last night.

1089
00:53:54.189 --> 00:53:56.816
- Hey...
- Lester, what are you feeding your turtle?

1090
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.110
Ugh. Anything that
will make him sick.

1091
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:00.695
I'm sorry, Skippy.

1092
00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:03.114
But Daddy's gotta see
that veterinarian.

1093
00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:04.783
What?
This is nothing!

1094
00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:06.660
I saw this freak in a parking lot

1095
00:54:06.743 --> 00:54:08.828
try to shove a bottle opener
in a Great Dane's ass,

1096
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.080
just to get an
emergency appointment.

1097
00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:11.957
Are you talking about
the vet over on Vera Donna?

1098
00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:14.334
- Oh...
- Lizzie threatened to put Mr. Whiskers to sleep

1099
00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:15.669
if I went near that place again.

1100
00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.963
- She is so pretty.
- Mmm.

1101
00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:19.547
But not in like a, "I'm a model,

1102
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:20.840
don't fucking look at me" way.

1103
00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.802
- And she's just so smart and funny.
- Yes.

1104
00:54:23.885 --> 00:54:26.054
And you know what I love about her?
My favorite thing.

1105
00:54:26.137 --> 00:54:27.389
- The way she cracks her neck.
- Mmm-mm-mm.

1106
00:54:27.472 --> 00:54:30.016
- What about that silver anklet of hers?
- Ohh...

1107
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.810
You know, if you can't
make it to the clinic,

1108
00:54:31.893 --> 00:54:33.228
you should try the gym
on Wednesday,

1109
00:54:33.311 --> 00:54:35.021
or Trader Joe's on Thursday.

1110
00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:36.690
- Well, I do like Trader Joe's.
- Yeah.

1111
00:54:36.773 --> 00:54:38.149
It's all on the
Dr. Miranda Storm website.

1112
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.484
Yeah, it's a website.
I've been there.

1113
00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:42.779
It's put together by one of these
real stalker geek types.

1114
00:54:42.862 --> 00:54:45.073
Oh, thank God
you're not one of those.

1115
00:54:45.156 --> 00:54:47.117
Ladies, we've got
a football game going on here.

1116
00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.160
Enough talking about
the X chromosome.

1117
00:54:49.244 --> 00:54:52.372
Especially the almighty
Dr. Miranda--

1118
00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.001
Dr. Mir--

1119
00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.088
Is he smirking?

1120
00:55:00.171 --> 00:55:01.172
You're smirking.
Why is Rod smirking?

1121
00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:02.716
Interception!

1122
00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:04.134
You see it?

1123
00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.178
I told you!
I told you!

1124
00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:09.681
Yes! Oh, yes!

1125
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.020
Phew. Perfecto.

1126
00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:17.647
I can still make Miranda's
4:20 Starbucks appearance.

1127
00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:18.773
She orders a...

1128
00:55:18.857 --> 00:55:20.317
Macchiato with extra foam.

1129
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.569
I could use some caffeine myself.
I'll come with.

1130
00:55:22.652 --> 00:55:25.113
No, you're not getting anywhere
near her, Midas Dick.

1131
00:55:25.196 --> 00:55:26.364
Fine. I'll go to Deitrich's, then.

1132
00:55:26.448 --> 00:55:27.574
I got work to do, anyway.

1133
00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:28.908
Please, Rod.

1134
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.827
Just this one time,
don't seduce this--

1135
00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:35.248
Oh, diarrhea! Yes!

1136
00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:17.581
You always carry
a bottle opener?

1137
00:56:17.582 --> 00:56:21.044
This little guy?
He's been through a lot.

1138
00:56:21.127 --> 00:56:23.963
I quit my job today because
of this bottle opener.

1139
00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:26.883
Not-so-great day.
Long story.

1140
00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.596
Why were you staring at me?

1141
00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.973
Oh, don't worry, Doc.
I'm not one of your stalkers.

1142
00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:37.310
If I were, I'd be at Starbucks
about now, wouldn't I?

1143
00:56:37.394 --> 00:56:39.813
You've seen the website.

1144
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:41.398
No. I've--
I've heard about it.

1145
00:56:41.481 --> 00:56:42.899
I've heard about you.

1146
00:56:42.982 --> 00:56:45.735
Really. Well, you missed out.

1147
00:56:45.819 --> 00:56:47.195
It's quite good.

1148
00:56:47.278 --> 00:56:50.824
It's got great graphics,
challenging quizzes.

1149
00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:54.828
It's obviously caused me
to rearrange my rituals.

1150
00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.625
You're not gonna use
your spoon, are you?

1151
00:57:16.724 --> 00:57:18.977
Okay. The bottle opener,
I'm gonna let slide.

1152
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.855
But the spoon?
Start talking.

1153
00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:24.107
A place like this,
it gives you a knife,

1154
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.526
a fork, a spoon,
wrapped in a napkin.

1155
00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.153
Now the knife,
the fork, the napkin,

1156
00:57:28.236 --> 00:57:29.654
they all get used.

1157
00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:32.407
Most cafe items,
they don't call for a spoon.

1158
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.118
But that little guy, he gets thrown
in the washing machine,

1159
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:37.954
over and over,
time and time again.

1160
00:57:38.037 --> 00:57:40.039
Without a sense of worth.

1161
00:57:41.332 --> 00:57:43.042
Not only compassionate
to furry creatures,

1162
00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:44.836
but inanimate objects as well.

1163
00:57:44.919 --> 00:57:48.465
There's gonna be some fun
in the chat room tonight.

1164
00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:52.135
You're doing it again.

1165
00:57:52.218 --> 00:57:56.806
That funny, charming
staring thing.

1166
00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:00.768
It's not unpleasant.

1167
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:06.649
But you should know that I...recently got out

1168
00:58:06.733 --> 00:58:08.902
of a very bad relationship, so I'm--

1169
00:58:08.985 --> 00:58:12.739
Yeah, I just got out of
a lot of bad relationships.

1170
00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.407
I promise I won't
fall in love with you

1171
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:17.243
as long as you promise you won't
fall in love with me.

1172
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:21.998
Oh, I promise.

1173
00:58:28.129 --> 00:58:30.507
Favorite Vonnegut.
One, two, three.

1174
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:31.925
Cat's Cradle.

1175
00:58:32.008 --> 00:58:34.302
Favorite Dylan.
One, two, three.

1176
00:58:34.385 --> 00:58:36.596
Nashville Skyline.

1177
00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:41.768
Funniest movie ever made.
One, two, three.

1178
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:43.394
- Some Like It Hot.
- Caddyshack.

1179
00:58:43.478 --> 00:58:44.729
Oh. Guys in dresses.

1180
00:58:44.812 --> 00:58:47.315
That's really reinventing
the wheel there, Roderick.

1181
00:58:47.398 --> 00:58:49.275
A woman who likes
Caddyshack.

1182
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:50.485
Who wouldn't like Caddyshack?

1183
00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:52.529
Favorite porno? One, two, three.

1184
00:58:54.489 --> 00:58:56.616
All those tingling thrill-of-the-pursuit

1185
00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:58.243
feelings came flooding back.

1186
00:58:58.326 --> 00:59:00.662
So then came wish three.

1187
00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:02.497
I said I wanted
a pumpkin as a head.

1188
00:59:04.832 --> 00:59:07.085
Sure, I had the whole
"Dr. Mir" thing,

1189
00:59:07.168 --> 00:59:09.963
from my peek at the list, to clue me
into where Miranda and I were heading.

1190
00:59:10.046 --> 00:59:12.382
But this would be
more than a romance.

1191
00:59:12.465 --> 00:59:15.426
More than a mere
checking-off of a name.

1192
00:59:16.427 --> 00:59:18.555
This would be love.

1193
00:59:18.638 --> 00:59:20.390
Why rush the sex?

1194
00:59:20.473 --> 00:59:22.559
- Okay.
- All day, people wheel

1195
00:59:22.642 --> 00:59:24.394
and take back
the carts in the front.

1196
00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:26.229
And this poor bastard
in the middle

1197
00:59:26.354 --> 00:59:28.481
- probably hasn't been pushed in months.
- Tragic.

1198
00:59:28.565 --> 00:59:30.149
It's tr-- you know what?
It is. Help.

1199
00:59:30.233 --> 00:59:32.569
You know, you say you've been looking
for an idea for a children's book.

1200
00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:34.696
How about all these
inanimate objects of yours?

1201
00:59:34.779 --> 00:59:37.448
The spoon that never gets used.

1202
00:59:37.532 --> 00:59:40.451
The missing sock that
reunites with his twin.

1203
00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:43.663
The multi-CD player that
tragically gets turned off

1204
00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.790
seconds before proudly finishing

1205
00:59:45.873 --> 00:59:47.959
a five-disc shuffle.

1206
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.754
That's so it.

1207
00:59:51.838 --> 00:59:53.298
Yes, it is.

1208
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:55.550
Roderick...

1209
00:59:58.011 --> 01:00:00.430
I've been looking
for you all my life.

1210
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:09.439
You're the best!

1211
01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.233
Come on. Get out.

1212
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.361
Okay. The cheek thing had thrown me a bit.

1213
01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.614
But there's nothing
like a warm kiss

1214
01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.699
coming after a delicious
home-cooked meal.

1215
01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:21.951
Compliments to the chef.

1216
01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:26.080
Hmm.

1217
01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:28.916
- Yup. I was back in the kitchen.
- Yeah?

1218
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.753
And the chef thinks
you're pretty great, too.

1219
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.632
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just-- just not--

1220
01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.383
- No, no, no, no. It's okay.
- I'm just feeling--

1221
01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.593
Just relax. It's okay--

1222
01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:41.012
- No, Roderick.
- It's all right.

1223
01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.642
I adore you.

1224
01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.769
I do.

1225
01:00:47.852 --> 01:00:49.562
I'm just...

1226
01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:50.980
screwed up about sex.

1227
01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.273
Ah, it's okay--

1228
01:00:52.357 --> 01:00:54.442
I mean, you're handsome.

1229
01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:56.277
Devilishly so,
if you must know.

1230
01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:01.908
It's just... you so remind me

1231
01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:03.660
of the guy my mom went out with,

1232
01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.453
after the divorce, Rockin' Randy.

1233
01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:06.496
He ran the surf shop.

1234
01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:10.415
And he was a cross
between you and Bam-Bam

1235
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.627
from The Flintstones.

1236
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.128
Listen, okay, look.

1237
01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.130
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1238
01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.132
I'm not saying that. I'm just--

1239
01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:22.136
I'm just saying
if it's gonna happen...

1240
01:01:23.554 --> 01:01:24.806
it's just gonna happen.

1241
01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:26.849
- Yeah.
- Right?

1242
01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:28.309
Yeah.

1243
01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.852
Really, why worry about it?

1244
01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:33.398
You're the best.

1245
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.317
I'm gonna clean up.

1246
01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:40.071
You can pick out another DVD.

1247
01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:41.614
Something funny.

1248
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.041
I guess you could say

1249
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.794
that's when the madness set in.

1250
01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.838
Thanks.

1251
01:01:56.921 --> 01:01:59.716
So Miranda and I went to
the Fellini retrospective yesterday.

1252
01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.677
Oh, she said the coolest thing.

1253
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.263
- If Marcelo were alive--
- Have you fucked her yet?

1254
01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:08.975
What is with that question?

1255
01:02:09.058 --> 01:02:10.685
Have you fucked her yet?

1256
01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:12.061
Have you fucked her yet?

1257
01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:14.188
Son...

1258
01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.565
have you fucked her yet?

1259
01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:16.774
Yo, Rod, have you fucked her--

1260
01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:18.067
Hey, have you--

1261
01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:26.659
Let me tell you something.

1262
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:30.037
Miranda and I are building
a bond of trust and respect.

1263
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:32.623
Excuse me for still believing
that love is something

1264
01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.877
more than a sloppy
fusion of genitalia.

1265
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.212
Miranda, we need
to discuss something.

1266
01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:41.215
- I--
- Oh, shit.

1267
01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:43.217
- Shit, shit, shit.
- You okay?

1268
01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.886
Hide me.
No, just hide me.

1269
01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:45.970
Sure.

1270
01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:48.890
There's
a Frida Kahlo-looking dude.

1271
01:02:48.973 --> 01:02:49.891
No, no, right--

1272
01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:51.100
Oh, no, I got it.

1273
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:55.062
I met him at this Halloween
Poe poetry reading thing.

1274
01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:56.773
I can't believe
I slept with him.

1275
01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:57.857
I was wasted.

1276
01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.151
Halloween, two weeks
ago Halloween?

1277
01:03:00.234 --> 01:03:02.487
I told you,
I'm totally screwed up about sex.

1278
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:05.031
Screwed up about sex?
Screwed up about sex?

1279
01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.741
It's more like you're screwing.

1280
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:08.242
That's funny.

1281
01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:09.619
Come on, let's go
somewhere else.

1282
01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.371
Bam-Bam.

1283
01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.795
Back in the day,

1284
01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:22.423
if a woman didn't have
sex with you it was okay,

1285
01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:26.385
because it wasn't like she was having sex
with anyone else.

1286
01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.013
Where is that whore-bitch
Jane Austen when you need her?

1287
01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:31.933
I chose to remember
the good times.

1288
01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:33.184
The way Miranda
made you feel

1289
01:03:33.267 --> 01:03:35.895
like you were the only
one in the world.

1290
01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.606
That time she read
my slaughterhouse reform bill.

1291
01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:45.279
It's wonderful, just wonderful.

1292
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:49.700
But then there was
that next day at lunch.

1293
01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.035
How was that salad for you?

1294
01:03:51.118 --> 01:03:52.036
Oh...

1295
01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.708
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1296
01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:08.344
And in conclusion, yeah,
go ahead, crucify me,

1297
01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:10.221
but I refuse to live in a society

1298
01:04:10.304 --> 01:04:12.974
that has reduced the world
to the question,

1299
01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.559
"Have you fucked her yet?"

1300
01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:17.061
That would be a no.

1301
01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.064
I don't even think
he's seen her naked.

1302
01:04:27.071 --> 01:04:28.990
Oh...

1303
01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:32.451
Wonderful, just wonderful.

1304
01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:33.703
What the fuck?

1305
01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:42.211
I'm not saying nothing's
ever gonna happen between us.

1306
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.017
Doctor...

1307
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.810
Mir-- hah!

1308
01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.395
That's what I'm talking about.

1309
01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:02.273
Yes, Dr. Mirabella Stone!

1310
01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:05.776
No! No!

1311
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.156
No!

1312
01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.498
Don't mock me.

1313
01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.042
Miranda told me
she was coming out

1314
01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:22.293
of a bad relationship.

1315
01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:25.254
And no one has ever had sex
coming out of a bad relationship.

1316
01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.132
Oh, we're moving way too fast,

1317
01:05:28.215 --> 01:05:31.135
I'm not feeling well.

1318
01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:32.720
If someone wants
to have sex with you,

1319
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:34.305
they'll have sex with you.

1320
01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:36.140
The rest is just dinner theater.

1321
01:05:36.223 --> 01:05:39.393
So that's it. The machine.

1322
01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.812
Oh, no, the machine is much--

1323
01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.941
Sure. The wall has a connection.

1324
01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.734
Thing's going to be
the death of me.

1325
01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:49.987
Oh, come on, cheer up,
droopy drawers.

1326
01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.781
I mean, look on the side
of the bright.

1327
01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:55.618
Even if you went down
to a tropical island, all right?

1328
01:05:55.701 --> 01:05:58.537
The remaining 34 chicks
on this list

1329
01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.165
would be renting jet skis
to zoom down there

1330
01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:03.668
and party with you
whether you liked it or not.

1331
01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.128
I don't like it.
I don't want other women.

1332
01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.338
I want Miranda!

1333
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:10.007
I've been a good
sport with this thing.

1334
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.509
There was a little weirdness
at the beginning,

1335
01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:13.594
but I went with the flow.

1336
01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.888
I sabotaged a wedding,
I lost deposits,

1337
01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.431
I toyed with a lot
of people's feelings,

1338
01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:21.227
including my own,
but I didn't care.

1339
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:23.229
I care now.

1340
01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.773
I have found someone
that touches me

1341
01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.191
down to my marrow.

1342
01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:29.944
And if you think that
some contraption is gonna--

1343
01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:31.070
You know, you know--

1344
01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.406
sometimes love is stronger than--

1345
01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.824
No, it's not!

1346
01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.836
I was so proud of you when you...

1347
01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.754
were burying the list in the backyard.

1348
01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:52.341
Horoscopes, psychics,
Tarot cards,

1349
01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.594
coming attractions that
give away the whole movie.

1350
01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.764
Why must you people
know everything?

1351
01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.474
That's a good point, Alpha, sir.

1352
01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.560
Remember when you said
the machine was a mystery?

1353
01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.146
That could mean that there's
some kind of kink or flaw,

1354
01:07:05.229 --> 01:07:06.272
something that
we don't know about--

1355
01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.149
Stop thinking about
the machine, Mr. Blank.

1356
01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:09.400
It's progress.

1357
01:07:09.483 --> 01:07:12.194
There's nothing
you can do about it.

1358
01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:15.573
Science and technology
don't care whether we live or die.

1359
01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:18.576
Excuse me.

1360
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:24.206
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1361
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:26.584
The solution's been right
in front of us the whole time!

1362
01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:28.085
What, what is it?

1363
01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.086
Blow jobs.

1364
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.297
Blow jobs!
Oh, man, what a loophole.

1365
01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.133
All right, sex is work.

1366
01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:36.218
Is she having a good time?
Am I meeting her needs?

1367
01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.928
You got to think
about her feelings,

1368
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:40.890
but with a blow job,
you just lie back,

1369
01:07:40.973 --> 01:07:42.641
every now and then touch
the back of her head

1370
01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:44.101
if you think she's getting tentative.

1371
01:07:44.185 --> 01:07:46.979
I mean, seriously, if someone
gives me an intercourse buffet,

1372
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.148
or just a blow job on a stick,

1373
01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.775
I'll take blow job
on a stick, dude.

1374
01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:53.360
No, you people--
you people are sick.

1375
01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:55.654
I've given my heart to Miranda.

1376
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.156
I want to cradle her
in my arms,

1377
01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.033
I want to make the kind of love
where you feel

1378
01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:01.660
as though you're one
living, breathing...

1379
01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.079
You really think
she might go down on me?

1380
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:07.958
Death Nell has just put to sleep

1381
01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:10.336
an entire fraternity in Fresno.

1382
01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:11.420
Eight members.

1383
01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.130
Death Nell?

1384
01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:14.799
What do you guys do
for a living again?

1385
01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.175
It's the double-digit rule.

1386
01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.677
When a serial killer hits ten victims,
we get called.

1387
01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.347
No, I'm still getting details.

1388
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.182
Apparently...

1389
01:08:24.683 --> 01:08:26.685
Well, apparently it was
the same frat house

1390
01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:27.728
that was acquitted last year

1391
01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.647
for manufacturing
the date rape drug.

1392
01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:43.911
D.N. put her own drug in the keg.

1393
01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:47.748
Is that amusing to you, Roderick?

1394
01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:49.500
No, I'm just checking
my messages.

1395
01:08:49.583 --> 01:08:52.211
The almighty machine's rep's
about to take another hit.

1396
01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.965
They love the concepts,
they love the drawings,

1397
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.884
they-- they're going
to publish the book!

1398
01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:02.263
Rod, I owe you so, so, much!

1399
01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:04.265
There's no way
we are not celebrating tonight.

1400
01:09:04.348 --> 01:09:06.142
Okay? So I'm going
to be at your place,

1401
01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:09.103
8:00 sharp, ready for action.

1402
01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.647
I so love you.

1403
01:09:13.357 --> 01:09:16.443
You're a very lucky man to have
found such a soulmate, Mr. Blank,

1404
01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.653
but unfortunately--

1405
01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.446
It's in her voice!

1406
01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.198
You don't even need
the bizarro list.

1407
01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.200
She doesn't think of you in--

1408
01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:25.327
Roderick...

1409
01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.290
I'm certain that some
very interesting things

1410
01:09:29.373 --> 01:09:31.584
will occur this evening.

1411
01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.128
Your penis going into her vagina
will not be one them.

1412
01:09:37.464 --> 01:09:38.841
But have a lovely evening.

1413
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.760
Gentlemen, I'd love
to stay and chat,

1414
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:45.222
but I got a date with a lady.

1415
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.652
I don't think he's even seen her naked.

1416
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:07.411
Hey!

1417
01:10:07.494 --> 01:10:08.621
Author!

1418
01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.039
Author!

1419
01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:12.041
Thank you.
J.K. Rowling, eat shit.

1420
01:10:12.124 --> 01:10:15.628
I'm so sorry I'm late,
it's just--

1421
01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.254
It's been crazy.

1422
01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:18.964
But I told everyone that
we'd meet them at the bar.

1423
01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.674
- It's my treat, for once.
- Everyone?

1424
01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.343
I thought tonight
was between you and--

1425
01:10:22.426 --> 01:10:24.386
I made pesto.

1426
01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.182
You did.

1427
01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:31.060
That's so sweet,
but Rod, we gotta go out.

1428
01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:32.811
We're celebrating!

1429
01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.730
My brother and the two Jessicas,
they're already there,

1430
01:10:34.813 --> 01:10:36.315
but you know what,
it's no big deal.

1431
01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.108
- Hey, hey, just relax.
- Listen, if you-- what?

1432
01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.610
Let's just hang for a bit,

1433
01:10:39.693 --> 01:10:42.446
you know, a little pre-party.

1434
01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:46.033
Dude, I thought
we were past this.

1435
01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.411
No?

1436
01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.584
Miranda, I know you once said
you weren't attracted to me,

1437
01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:58.170
but that was before
we went on the camping trip.

1438
01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:01.257
That was before I loaded
the graphics program into your laptop.

1439
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.134
- Before--
- Why is it that men think that women--

1440
01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:09.890
women are like these giant
thermometers at those telethons,

1441
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.642
where every time you do
something nice for them,

1442
01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:14.144
they get a little redder,
and a little redder,

1443
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:15.896
and a little redder,
and a little redder,

1444
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:17.690
and when you hit the top,
we have to fuck you?

1445
01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.483
That is not funny!

1446
01:11:19.566 --> 01:11:20.859
Shit!

1447
01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:21.902
Okay, I'm sorry.

1448
01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:24.071
All right, just slip on down here,

1449
01:11:24.154 --> 01:11:25.990
just do a little clean-up.

1450
01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.746
Hey, what are the five
scariest words a woman can say?

1451
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:35.207
- I wanna be--
- Just friends.

1452
01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:45.009
You know, it's like
some bad stand-up routine.

1453
01:11:45.092 --> 01:11:48.304
Just? Just.

1454
01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:51.181
Do you know how
important it was for me

1455
01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.183
to make one real friend
in this city?

1456
01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:59.106
I would die for you.

1457
01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:02.026
Who do you think
I'm dedicating my book to?

1458
01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.028
My insane parents?

1459
01:12:05.529 --> 01:12:10.868
"To Roderick Blank, my friend."

1460
01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.377
Nice celebration.

1461
01:12:32.264 --> 01:12:34.933
Oh, Miranda.

1462
01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.727
Man, that is one tough break.

1463
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.854
Girlfriend finds out her little book's

1464
01:12:38.937 --> 01:12:41.357
getting published and then...

1465
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.441
It's terrible.

1466
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:48.113
Not my girlfriend.

1467
01:12:49.406 --> 01:12:51.116
For what it's worth, from our end,

1468
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.243
we're satisfied the death
was just an accident.

1469
01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:54.953
Just--

1470
01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:55.996
Excuse me, officer,

1471
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.707
I wanted to give
Mr. Blank the opportunity

1472
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:01.668
- to say goodbye to his girlfriend.
- Not my--

1473
01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.170
Can I be alone with her?

1474
01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.594
Miranda.

1475
01:13:10.677 --> 01:13:13.180
Oh, precious Miranda.

1476
01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.143
You know, I never wanted this.

1477
01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:21.313
I-I only wanted--

1478
01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.399
They said that we could never,

1479
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.401
never ever be together.

1480
01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.988
But hey,

1481
01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.157
we're gonna have the last laugh,

1482
01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.575
are we not, my love?

1483
01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:48.006
Okay, now that I think about it,

1484
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.134
maybe this is where
the madness set in.

1485
01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:53.178
Yes, I know,
my beacon of light.

1486
01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:56.557
This is sad,
this is desperate,

1487
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.268
this is disgusting,

1488
01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:02.187
but aren't all revolutions?

1489
01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.941
We have to stand up to the list.

1490
01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:08.902
Stand up to the machine.

1491
01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:12.156
Stand up to fate.

1492
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.408
Stand up, soldier.

1493
01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.410
Oh, come on, stand up.

1494
01:14:58.118 --> 01:15:01.330
Oh, let it out, Mr. Blank.

1495
01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:03.832
It's okay. Let it out.

1496
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.128
You poor, sweet man.

1497
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:12.299
You poor, sweet, handsome man.

1498
01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:25.354
Oh, shh...

1499
01:15:25.437 --> 01:15:27.689
It's okay.

1500
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:48.335
Sorry.

1501
01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:51.797
Believe me, I'd hoped it was
a dream sequence, too.

1502
01:15:53.006 --> 01:15:54.424
If it makes you feel any better,

1503
01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:57.803
my tale has a satisfying ending.

1504
01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:00.305
But this isn't it.

1505
01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.058
It's only number 67.

1506
01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.405
Six, five, four,

1507
01:16:58.488 --> 01:17:03.535
three, two, one,
Happy New Year!

1508
01:17:13.503 --> 01:17:15.380
Nobody has said
"Happy New Year" to you.

1509
01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.424
Thank you. Roderick Blank.

1510
01:17:17.507 --> 01:17:19.468
Ester Fenchel.

1511
01:17:19.551 --> 01:17:21.261
But your friends call you Terry.

1512
01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.221
No, but that's strange

1513
01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.642
because that's
my husband's name, Terry.

1514
01:17:26.725 --> 01:17:28.226
Nice tie.

1515
01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:35.275
Just leave the bottle.

1516
01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.696
Gentlemen, I give you the Matador.

1517
01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:44.910
Oh! No!
Not the prototype!

1518
01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:47.496
Eating and starving,

1519
01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:49.956
and eating and starving.

1520
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:53.001
I was told to take some time off,

1521
01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:55.671
to get away from it all for a while.

1522
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:58.382
But there was no escape.

1523
01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:00.550
I had noticed a lot
of French, German,

1524
01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.427
and Italian names on the list,

1525
01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.805
so I dutifully booked
passage to Europe.

1526
01:18:04.888 --> 01:18:07.140
Hearing of all
the magnifique women,

1527
01:18:07.224 --> 01:18:08.558
my friends concluded
that I had had

1528
01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:12.020
the greatest vacation
of all time.

1529
01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.814
I'm glad they enjoyed it.

1530
01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.169
Good evening.

1531
01:18:36.253 --> 01:18:39.673
You have to fuck me,
so come over and fuck me.

1532
01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:42.175
No dinner.
Do you have a pen?

1533
01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:43.510
Let me give you directions.

1534
01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:44.845
Ew!

1535
01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:52.769
Hello.

1536
01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:56.398
Oh, star 69.
Yes, it was a crank.

1537
01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:58.525
I'm sorry.

1538
01:18:58.608 --> 01:19:00.318
Your mother picked up?
Fainted?

1539
01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.696
-Yes.
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

1540
01:19:04.656 --> 01:19:06.324
Why are you laughing?

1541
01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.785
In my own feeble way,

1542
01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.746
I had tried to defy the list.

1543
01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:11.913
But once again,

1544
01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:13.957
the list knew what it was doing,

1545
01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:16.042
what I was doing.

1546
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.461
But guess what.

1547
01:19:17.544 --> 01:19:18.670
I was about to meet a woman

1548
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.090
that was the answer
to all my problems.

1549
01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:24.676
- Hope?
- Amber Anne.

1550
01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.303
Roderick?

1551
01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:34.603
I've been trying for years
to get a rise out of my mother.

1552
01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:37.189
You did it in five seconds.

1553
01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.567
Name your poison.

1554
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:42.194
[Narrating]
Hope Hartlight was the author

1555
01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:44.362
of a best-selling self-help book.

1556
01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:47.616
I found her to be
warm, compassionate,

1557
01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:49.326
and a little old.

1558
01:19:49.409 --> 01:19:51.703
So I wasn't attracted
to Hope Hartlight.

1559
01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:54.289
It's not like I was going to get out
of having sex with her.

1560
01:19:54.372 --> 01:19:57.542
So, to her surprise,
I asked her out again,

1561
01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.212
figuring we'd eventually
accidentally end up having sex,

1562
01:20:00.295 --> 01:20:02.714
and I could move on.

1563
01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.842
But a funny thing happened.

1564
01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:07.761
Hope listened.

1565
01:20:07.844 --> 01:20:10.180
Hope guided.

1566
01:20:10.263 --> 01:20:13.767
Hope was literature
after ten months of pop-up books,

1567
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:16.144
chess after ten months
of checkers.

1568
01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.271
You're a chapter 17.

1569
01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:19.898
May she spring eternal--

1570
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.609
As for my friends,
what do you think?

1571
01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:24.653
Hope was an Earth-mother goddess,

1572
01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:26.905
put down here to save
the sinner's soul.

1573
01:20:26.988 --> 01:20:29.407
If you let her go,
I'll bring her back.

1574
01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:31.576
You know, you strike me
as the kind of guy

1575
01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.703
who would make fun
of a one-month

1576
01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:36.039
anniversary celebration.

1577
01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:38.667
You've changed me.

1578
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:40.418
You've healed me.

1579
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.884
That's a really
beautiful thing to say.

1580
01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:49.678
Thank you.

1581
01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:52.138
You know, I've got
that book signing

1582
01:20:52.222 --> 01:20:54.307
next week in Vermont.

1583
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.852
I'm thinking maybe
you should come with me.

1584
01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.229
They've got a terrific
bed and breakfast up there.

1585
01:20:59.312 --> 01:21:00.272
Oh, my God.

1586
01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.731
We could just sleep late,

1587
01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:04.651
on the day I don't
have to work, of course.

1588
01:21:04.734 --> 01:21:06.945
But you could just
hang out all day.

1589
01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.905
You can walk around naked
in the backyard.

1590
01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.949
There's nobody there,
it's off-season.

1591
01:21:12.742 --> 01:21:14.202
Hope Hartlight didn't really vanish

1592
01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:16.580
into thin air like that.

1593
01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:18.123
It took a couple of weeks.

1594
01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.833
How could being the answer
to all my problems

1595
01:21:19.916 --> 01:21:21.209
not be enough?

1596
01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.378
If a friend of mine had
been going out with Hope,

1597
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:25.088
I'd be so proud of him.

1598
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.631
Guess that's the problem.

1599
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.717
I'd be proud,
but I wouldn’t be jealous.

1600
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.635
And a man would rather have
another man's jealousy

1601
01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.679
than another man's respect.

1602
01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:36.141
Man, hate to say
that one out loud.

1603
01:21:37.934 --> 01:21:39.394
Okay.

1604
01:21:39.477 --> 01:21:42.022
So, maybe Hope wasn't
the hottest piece of pie

1605
01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:43.523
you've ever been with,

1606
01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:45.859
but Roderick,
I was so proud of you.

1607
01:21:45.942 --> 01:21:48.111
Us married guys are taking a lot
of heat over this one, big guy.

1608
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:50.363
It seems that you broke some

1609
01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.908
"messing with the feelings
of a woman over 35" covenant.

1610
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:56.077
I thought we agreed we weren't
going to do an intervention.

1611
01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:58.747
No, we agreed we wouldn't use
the word "intervention."

1612
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:01.166
- Of course it's an intervention.
- Okay.

1613
01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:02.792
Poor Rod, still under the illusion

1614
01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:04.336
that out there walking around

1615
01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.588
is the perfect girl, just for him.

1616
01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.965
News break! This just in.

1617
01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:10.800
The woman known to
the world as Death Nell

1618
01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.886
has apparently left
her driver's license

1619
01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:15.096
at the site of her latest attack.

1620
01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.222
It is the break in the case

1621
01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:19.434
investigators have been hoping
and praying for all year.

1622
01:22:19.517 --> 01:22:22.520
And now, Channel Nine gives you
an exclusive first look

1623
01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:25.273
at this dramatic license.

1624
01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:26.608
If you're just joining us,

1625
01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:28.818
Death Nell seduced and sedated

1626
01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.863
misogynist shock jock D.J. Harry Hunt

1627
01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.156
during a commercial break

1628
01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:34.574
on his morning drive-time program.

1629
01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.993
I appreciate everyone's
concern here.

1630
01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:39.621
I, um...

1631
01:22:39.704 --> 01:22:40.622
Hello?

1632
01:22:40.705 --> 01:22:42.165
Hey, Trixie, turn that up.

1633
01:22:42.248 --> 01:22:45.168
Did they really catch
that satanic succubus?

1634
01:22:45.251 --> 01:22:48.505
No, and the word's
"freedom fighter."

1635
01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:50.924
- Can we go in closer on that license--
- Let me guess.

1636
01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:53.343
I'm gonna bet that
her real name is not Death Nell!

1637
01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:56.179
This is some intervention.

1638
01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:57.931
Gillian De Raisx.

1639
01:22:58.014 --> 01:23:01.643
That name again, folks,
Gillian De Raisx.

1640
01:23:01.726 --> 01:23:05.021
Death Nell is Gillian De Raisx.

1641
01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:08.817
Gillian De Raisx. The X is silent.

1642
01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.860
It was a name that sounded familiar.

1643
01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:13.989
And when a name sounded
familiar, it usually meant...

1644
01:23:16.449 --> 01:23:20.161
Okay, this wasn't happening.

1645
01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:21.913
I know what you're thinking.

1646
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.582
Surely I would have memorized
the last name on the list.

1647
01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.044
Not to put too fine
a point on it, but why?

1648
01:23:28.128 --> 01:23:30.630
No one wants to think about
the last name on the list,

1649
01:23:30.714 --> 01:23:33.967
because the last name
on the list means...

1650
01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:37.554
What did you say to him?
Where's he going?

1651
01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:51.735
Fred!

1652
01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:53.653
Oh, man, it's kind of funny.

1653
01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:55.864
It's not like she's the next one.

1654
01:23:55.947 --> 01:23:57.282
She may not be the next one,

1655
01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:58.616
but she sure as hell is the last one.

1656
01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.077
Hey, there's got to be
another woman on the planet

1657
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.912
whose name is Gillian De aisx.

1658
01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.040
With her last name
spelled with a silent X?

1659
01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:06.833
- I don't think so.
- Calm down.

1660
01:24:06.916 --> 01:24:11.171
Gillian de Raisx may not be
the Gillian de Raisx.

1661
01:24:11.254 --> 01:24:13.631
As you can see,
the machine is closing in

1662
01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.592
on the one known as Death Nell.

1663
01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:17.594
The timelines have been
just a little off, but--

1664
01:24:17.677 --> 01:24:18.678
Oh, great.

1665
01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.853
More coordinates.

1666
01:24:26.936 --> 01:24:29.647
At this rate, I'd say
a couple of weeks from now

1667
01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:31.649
by the end of March,
the Oracle will tell us

1668
01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.942
where Gillian de Raisx is staying

1669
01:24:33.026 --> 01:24:34.861
at the precise moment
she's staying there.

1670
01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:37.489
Now, I'm assuming,
Mr. Blank,

1671
01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.491
that you can hold off from
having sex with how many?

1672
01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.742
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

1673
01:24:40.825 --> 01:24:42.911
Twenty different women
in the next two weeks.

1674
01:24:42.994 --> 01:24:45.580
Hey, I've had sex with three women
in my entire life--

1675
01:24:45.663 --> 01:24:47.916
none if you don't count paying for it.

1676
01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:49.459
I could live off 20 women.

1677
01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:52.128
Now, we can tell you
not to have sex,

1678
01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:55.090
but you have to go beyond that now.

1679
01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:59.052
You have to take your mind
to a whole other realm.

1680
01:24:59.135 --> 01:25:01.137
Read a book you've
always wanted to read.

1681
01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:03.348
I find model airplanes
can be an exacting

1682
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.599
but ultimately rewarding--

1683
01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:05.725
Model airplanes are great,

1684
01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.143
but I got to go back
to the blow jobs.

1685
01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:10.063
Fred. Not constructive.

1686
01:25:10.146 --> 01:25:12.148
How do you feel about biking?

1687
01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:15.860
I can't believe these are
the kind of conversations

1688
01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.071
I've become a part of.

1689
01:25:18.154 --> 01:25:19.531
He's still in torment.
Give him one.

1690
01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.865
One what?

1691
01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.742
Ah, yes, yes.

1692
01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:25.328
Our aforementioned Oracle,

1693
01:25:25.411 --> 01:25:29.332
while rather erratic
in capturing criminals,

1694
01:25:29.415 --> 01:25:31.918
has come up with the answers

1695
01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:35.213
to some of our culture's
most significant mysteries.

1696
01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.465
And I think we can
give you one of them.

1697
01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.175
Any of the biggies?

1698
01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:42.762
Okay, uh, who killed
Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman?

1699
01:25:42.846 --> 01:25:44.305
- You're kidding.
- Yeah, I'm kidding.

1700
01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:45.515
Let me see.
Let me see.

1701
01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:47.433
How about who really shot JFK?

1702
01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:48.393
Oh, pick another one.

1703
01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:50.270
It takes, like, 20 minutes to print out.

1704
01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.354
Okay, life on other planets.

1705
01:25:51.437 --> 01:25:52.772
How many planets
in the universe have--

1706
01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.108
- Eleven.
- Eleven? That's it?

1707
01:25:55.191 --> 01:25:57.235
That's it. How many
more do you want?

1708
01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.195
Wait a sec.
Does God exist?

1709
01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.030
Cut it out. You only get one.

1710
01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:03.241
Please.
You guys are mean.

1711
01:26:03.324 --> 01:26:05.326
You don't want to be in L.A.
on July 4th weekend.

1712
01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:08.121
Beta, enough.

1713
01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:16.129
There are 20 human shields
between you and Miss de Raisx.

1714
01:26:16.212 --> 01:26:18.298
Be conservative.

1715
01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:22.093
Don't use up any of them
until we catch the villainess.

1716
01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:25.054
And remember...

1717
01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:29.309
a new realm of existence.

1718
01:26:29.392 --> 01:26:31.978
A new realm of existence.

1719
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:35.148
No sex...

1720
01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:36.357
no death.

1721
01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.068
Good luck.

1722
01:26:56.127 --> 01:26:59.297
* On my own again *

1723
01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:00.798
* Oh, oh *

1724
01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.801
* On my own again *

1725
01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.094
* Oh, oh *

1726
01:27:05.178 --> 01:27:08.181
* On the move again *

1727
01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.990
* I need to be *

1728
01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.576
* On my own again *

1729
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.703
* I want to be *

1730
01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.872
* On my own again *

1731
01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:33.873
Yay!

1732
01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:35.124
Whoo!

1733
01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:40.088
"I never believed the wild and lascivious

1734
01:27:40.171 --> 01:27:43.758
letters in your magazine
were true until now."

1735
01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:47.220
"My best friend was cycling upstate

1736
01:27:47.303 --> 01:27:49.138

01:28:16.249 --> 01:28:17.709
"My friend's appearance
on the road

1749
01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.836
"was taken as a sign.

1750
01:28:19.919 --> 01:28:21.754
"A pact was made.

1751
01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:23.756
"Everyone's virginity must go,

1752
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.384
"and he would be the chosen vessel.

1753
01:28:26.467 --> 01:28:28.386
"All virgins.

1754
01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.888
"All 18-year-olds.

1755
01:28:30.972 --> 01:28:32.390
"Uniforms.

1756
01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:37.145
"Nineteen 18-year-old
virgins in uniforms.

1757
01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:40.189
Straws were drawn,
and first up was Mona Farlow."

1758
01:28:42.233 --> 01:28:45.320
Fuck. Fuck!

1759
01:28:45.403 --> 01:28:47.363
Fuck.

1760
01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.911
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1761
01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:57.457
Fuck, fuckity,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

1762
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.669
Fuck.

1763
01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:05.131
Fuck. Fuck!

1764
01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:09.510
"It was a day my friend
would never forget."

1765
01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:11.262
Any changes
before we mail it in?

1766
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.639
Please stop. I can't take it.

1767
01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:16.934
I'm curious.
Was there a lot of blood?

1768
01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:21.773
Sorry. Never mind. Wow!

1769
01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:23.733
- The ultimate male perversion.
- God!

1770
01:29:23.816 --> 01:29:25.151
You can die now.

1771
01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:27.195
Well, that seems
to be the problem.

1772
01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:40.124
Have I told you all
the good news?

1773
01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.667
I'm getting married.

1774
01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:43.836
The lucky gal's name
is Ethel Walters.

1775
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.380
I hope you can all
make the wedding.

1776
01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:47.048
Ethel Walters?

1777
01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:48.132
Do we know her?

1778
01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.801
I don't know. Do you?

1779
01:29:49.884 --> 01:29:52.011
I really need to get in touch
with her right away.

1780
01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.305
Does the name ring a bell
with anyone?

1781
01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.682
Maybe you should
lie back down.

1782
01:29:56.766 --> 01:29:58.184
Hey, you know what?

1783
01:29:58.267 --> 01:30:00.144
Where was the driver
in all this?

1784
01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.813
Because I get that
the church group chaperone

1785
01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.190
was on another bus,
but you can't tell me

1786
01:30:04.273 --> 01:30:05.817
they let the second group of girls
just transport themselves.

1787
01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.361
The driver, yeah.

1788
01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:11.239
I don't seem to r--

1789
01:30:11.322 --> 01:30:13.866
That's funny. The driver...

1790
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:16.119
There's a whole lot of action
going on back here.

1791
01:30:16.202 --> 01:30:18.079
Figure I'd get myself a piece.

1792
01:30:18.162 --> 01:30:19.539
Now, now, you relax.

1793
01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:22.250
You skinny little white girls
ain't tattling on nobody.

1794
01:30:22.333 --> 01:30:26.337
Fuck!

1795
01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.467
You can't have sex with me!

1796
01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:33.886
Roderick, it's me, Trixie.

1797
01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.304
I'm not going to rape you.

1798
01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:37.265
- You know that.
- Just leave me alone.

1799
01:30:37.348 --> 01:30:39.475
Get up, you big baby.

1800
01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.228
Got one word for you:
Qantas.

1801
01:30:42.311 --> 01:30:43.855
You are going to Australia.

1802
01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:46.357
Your flight leaves in the morning,
so start packing.

1803
01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:48.776
You don't get it. I can't escape.

1804
01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:51.487
She'll rent a jet ski,
and she'll track me down.

1805
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.197
I was on the Net all night.

1806
01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.740
I found another Gillian de Raisx.

1807
01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:56.659
Oh, yeah, that spells
her last name with a--

1808
01:30:56.742 --> 01:30:58.494
Yes, with a silent X.

1809
01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:02.373
She's a marine biologist
based outside of Sydney.

1810
01:31:06.419 --> 01:31:07.503
Oh, this picture.

1811
01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:09.380
Which one's the walrus?

1812
01:31:10.506 --> 01:31:11.799
She's big-boned

1813
01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:14.135
with a healthy appetite
for life, asshole.

1814
01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.262
What is-- What is that
on her face?

1815
01:31:16.429 --> 01:31:17.512
It's a rash

1816
01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:20.057
from her exploration
of the Barrier Reef.

1817
01:31:20.141 --> 01:31:21.809
- Ooh.
- Oh, God!

1818
01:31:21.893 --> 01:31:23.519
Roderick,

1819
01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:24.937
you'd rather die than have sex

1820
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:28.149
with an overweight woman
with a slight skin condition?

1821
01:31:28.232 --> 01:31:29.567
But it's--

1822
01:31:29.650 --> 01:31:30.943
it's not that slight.

1823
01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:34.363
Trixie, I'm sure she's a great--

1824
01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:36.365
I got you some books
to read on the plane.

1825
01:31:36.449 --> 01:31:39.285
I have underlined some
very good conversation starters.

1826
01:31:39.368 --> 01:31:41.245
So help me, if you
do not go Down Under

1827
01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:42.663
and seduce this Sheila--

1828
01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:45.041
Well, I do like dolphins.

1829
01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:46.417
Trixie.

1830
01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.838
No matter what happens,

1831
01:31:50.922 --> 01:31:52.340
thank you for being there.

1832
01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:54.091
You're a true pal.

1833
01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:58.554
It's good to be a lesbian, isn't it?

1834
01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.765
Send me a postcard, jerk.

1835
01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:04.101
With a koala on it.

1836
01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:24.789
* Doot-doo doot-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo *

1837
01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:27.583
* Doot-doo doot-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo *

1838
01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:30.503
* Doot-doo doot-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo *

1839
01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:33.422
* Doo-doo-doo-doo
doot-doo-doo doo-doo-doo *

1840
01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:36.300
* Doot-doo doot-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo *

1841
01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.053
* Doo-doo-doo-doo *

1842
01:32:39.136 --> 01:32:41.430
* Doot-doo doot-doo
doo-doo-doo-doo *

1843
01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:42.515
* Doo-doo-doo-doo *

1844
01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:56.070
Please don't pork me.

1845
01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:59.073
Hey, if you insist, hot rod.

1846
01:32:59.156 --> 01:33:03.035
Listen, the Almighty Oracle
has come through.

1847
01:33:03.119 --> 01:33:04.996
We have confirmation

1848
01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:07.498
that Death Nell
is going to be down here

1849
01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:09.458
at the Mayfair Hotel.

1850
01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:11.877
I've entered her room.

1851
01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:14.171
Mr. A's not here
at this precise moment,

1852
01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.257
but her things
most certainly are.

1853
01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.093
Friends, I've got chills.

1854
01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:22.763
Fred, Beta, you guys--

1855
01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:24.682
Wait. It's April Fool's Day,
isn't it?

1856
01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:25.850
It's 10 after midnight,

1857
01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:28.394
- officially April 2.
- Ha.

1858
01:33:28.477 --> 01:33:29.770
Yes, Roderick.

1859
01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:31.981
We have quite
a welcoming party

1860
01:33:32.064 --> 01:33:33.482
planned for the nasty minx.

1861
01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:35.109
Oh.

1862
01:33:35.192 --> 01:33:38.404
Oh, this is--
this is amazing.

1863
01:33:38.487 --> 01:33:42.283
You don't know
what it's been like.

1864
01:33:42.366 --> 01:33:44.702
And I have found the loophole

1865
01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:45.911
of all loopholes.

1866
01:33:45.995 --> 01:33:47.288
It's not blow jobs,

1867
01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:48.748
and it's not hand jobs.

1868
01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:50.166
It's exes.

1869
01:33:50.249 --> 01:33:53.085
It's ex,
as in ex-girlfriends, all right?

1870
01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:54.545
I want-- just-- listen.

1871
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.464
Check the names on the list.

1872
01:33:56.547 --> 01:33:58.507
Do any names appear twice?

1873
01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.509
Any doubles? All right, no.

1874
01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:02.386
Then don't tell me...

1875
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.972
that you've never hooked up
with some ex-girlfriend

1876
01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:07.725
for a little, uh, you know,
"remember when" sex.

1877
01:34:07.808 --> 01:34:10.436
No, you're right.
I had sex with Laura Baxter

1878
01:34:10.519 --> 01:34:12.605
every time I came
home for Christmas.

1879
01:34:12.688 --> 01:34:14.190
And she's only listed once.

1880
01:34:14.273 --> 01:34:16.108
And whenever I travel
through St. Louis,

1881
01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:18.235
I always stop in on Diana Scott.

1882
01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:20.696
We're going to get you
some reelection sex, all right?

1883
01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:23.240
I'm talking about
Grover Cleveland poontang.

1884
01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:25.534
Go back to Hope, number 80.

1885
01:34:25.618 --> 01:34:27.620
What you had was real.
She'll take you back.

1886
01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:29.538
Yes. There's Hope.

1887
01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.999
I've had so many wonderful,
fascinating women in my life.

1888
01:34:32.083 --> 01:34:34.085
I've never really been
worthy of any of them.

1889
01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:36.087
Uhh! Don't listen to Beta.

1890
01:34:36.170 --> 01:34:37.421
Do not listen to him.

1891
01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:39.674
He hates boners
and fun, all right?

1892
01:34:39.757 --> 01:34:42.843
What you have to do is you got
to find that school bus,

1893
01:34:42.927 --> 01:34:45.429
and you got to hook up
with those little Bible brats

1894
01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:47.640
numbers 81 through 99,

1895
01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:50.685
and maybe give 84 a pass
with the back zits.

1896
01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:53.729
- And you just get-- get--
- Sir?

1897
01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:57.191
Yes. It's right there.

1898
01:34:57.274 --> 01:35:00.569
Get one of them to change
her name to Gillian de Raisx.

1899
01:35:00.653 --> 01:35:01.779
And you perfect--

1900
01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.489
Stop it.

1901
01:35:05.157 --> 01:35:07.368
The theories
on the table are adorable.

1902
01:35:07.451 --> 01:35:09.412
But Roderick, be cool.

1903
01:35:09.495 --> 01:35:11.580
Gillian will be
at the hotel any minute,

1904
01:35:11.664 --> 01:35:13.374
and our organization--

1905
01:35:13.457 --> 01:35:17.169
well, we don't believe
in trials and arrests.

1906
01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:18.713
So I want you
to hang tight,

1907
01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:20.631
and do not, I repeat,

1908
01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:23.050
do not leave your house.

1909
01:35:23.134 --> 01:35:24.427
Okay.

1910
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:25.594
Call you when she's dead.

1911
01:35:25.678 --> 01:35:28.013
All right. I'll be here.

1912
01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:29.849
Thank you. Good-bye.

1913
01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:32.810
Ohh...

1914
01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:50.805
Did you really think
I was gonna get off easy?

1915
01:36:50.888 --> 01:36:53.516
Did you want me to?

1916
01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:55.643
I know I promised you
a satisfying ending,

1917
01:36:55.726 --> 01:36:56.977
but there will be
no triumphant return

1918
01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:59.730
to Fiona, Hope,
or anybody else.

1919
01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:02.358
There will be no chasing a cab,

1920
01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:03.776
no stopping a wedding,

1921
01:37:03.859 --> 01:37:07.780
no tearful reconciliations
on a train platform,

1922
01:37:07.863 --> 01:37:12.076
and no morning flights
to Australia.

1923
01:37:12.159 --> 01:37:16.247
To escape the sins of
my April 2nd to April 2nd saga

1924
01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:19.667
would feel so, so wrong.

1925
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.335
Yes, my true destiny

1926
01:37:21.418 --> 01:37:24.630
was staying in a hotel downtown.

1927
01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:28.551
I was going out with
a lady called Death.

1928
01:37:28.634 --> 01:37:31.011
No God or Machine
could help me now.

1929
01:37:32.888 --> 01:37:34.682
And that felt so,

1930
01:37:34.765 --> 01:37:35.933
so right.

1931
01:37:42.857 --> 01:37:47.236
You live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

1932
01:37:47.319 --> 01:37:50.239
One sexual position left.

1933
01:37:50.322 --> 01:37:52.241
Call it the karma sutra.

1934
01:37:54.618 --> 01:37:56.495
The end is coming.

1935
01:37:56.579 --> 01:37:58.998
And coming is the end.

1936
01:37:59.164 --> 01:38:00.875
We've checked all
the sectors, Fred.

1937
01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.001
Okay, you know what?

1938
01:38:02.084 --> 01:38:04.879
My name is not Fred.
It's Commander Delta.

1939
01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:07.047
- It-- just go. In.
- Move.

1940
01:38:12.803 --> 01:38:13.888
Excuse me.

1941
01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:16.098
Miss Death? Nell?

1942
01:38:16.181 --> 01:38:18.601
Or do you prefer Gillian?

1943
01:38:18.684 --> 01:38:20.436
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

1944
01:38:23.022 --> 01:38:25.190
Death Nell's alive
and inside us.

1945
01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.027
Look at him!
He's so scared!

1946
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.113
Aww!

1947
01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.785
Oh, where you going?
Come back, ladies' man!

1948
01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.800
Whew...

1949
01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:55.095
Well, you caused
quite a commotion out there.

1950
01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.389
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

1951
01:38:57.473 --> 01:38:59.516
Tell you? No. I, uh--

1952
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.355
Oh.

1953
01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.899
Hi.

1954
01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:09.777
Agents.

1955
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:13.197
There's agents staked out
at your hotel.

1956
01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.783
In your room.

1957
01:39:15.866 --> 01:39:17.034
Thanks.

1958
01:39:19.328 --> 01:39:20.955
You know I'm not innocent, right?

1959
01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.748
Yeah.

1960
01:39:26.251 --> 01:39:28.587
Can I-- Can I join...

1961
01:39:51.110 --> 01:39:52.236
Wow.

1962
01:39:53.278 --> 01:39:55.656
This, uh, place is amazing.

1963
01:39:55.739 --> 01:39:56.991
You know, I'm kind of
in the business.

1964
01:39:57.074 --> 01:39:58.909
I've never heard of it.

1965
01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:01.620
Yeah, I just discovered it
the other night.

1966
01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:04.707
There are not a lot of places
in this town that stay open late.

1967
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:06.834
Yeah.

1968
01:40:06.917 --> 01:40:09.378
- Do-- You know, I--
- I-- Well--

1969
01:40:09.461 --> 01:40:10.504
Sorry.

1970
01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.923
- You go.
- No, you go.

1971
01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:16.927
You know, this is--
this is strange for me.

1972
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:18.887
I've never had
a volunteer before.

1973
01:40:20.222 --> 01:40:22.224
Some guys will do
anything to get laid.

1974
01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:27.646
Uh-oh.

1975
01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.655
This has a...

1976
01:40:36.739 --> 01:40:38.907
a grape aftertaste.

1977
01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:41.910
And you do realize that

1978
01:40:41.994 --> 01:40:45.039
I can't guarantee when or--

1979
01:40:45.122 --> 01:40:47.916
or even if you'll wake up.

1980
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.419
Yeah. No, I understand.

1981
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:59.136
You mind if I ask you--

1982
01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.929
you tell me
if this is too personal,

1983
01:41:01.013 --> 01:41:05.517
but, uh...
how did you get here?

1984
01:41:05.601 --> 01:41:08.854
You know, in the larger sense?

1985
01:41:08.937 --> 01:41:10.522
It's not like I'm gonna
be telling anyone

1986
01:41:10.606 --> 01:41:12.775
for an indefinitely
long period of time.

1987
01:41:16.695 --> 01:41:17.988
I don't know.

1988
01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:20.115
I don't--

1989
01:41:20.199 --> 01:41:22.201
I'm not gonna talk
about my childhood.

1990
01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:25.454
You know?
'Cause that's not what--

1991
01:41:25.537 --> 01:41:29.041
My childhood wasn't any better
or worse than anyone else--

1992
01:41:29.124 --> 01:41:31.543
Oh, well, okay.
It was a little worse.

1993
01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:34.129
But, uh-- but I escaped.

1994
01:41:35.714 --> 01:41:38.842
That's where I studied
poetry and chemistry.

1995
01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.804
Obviously better
at the latter than the former.

1996
01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:43.180
No, I wouldn't say that.

1997
01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.890
I really enjoy your writing.

1998
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.482
You're right,
these spices do look amazing.

1999
01:41:53.565 --> 01:41:55.692
I mean, I've only read the stuff
that gets printed in the paper,

2000
01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.069
after each incident.

2001
01:41:57.152 --> 01:42:00.489
But what was it you spray-painted
after Number Seven?

2002
01:42:00.572 --> 01:42:02.533
"My ecstasy, your annihilation."

2003
01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:06.537
"Our mess, nothing left to transgress."

2004
01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.539
That's good.

2005
01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:11.583
But where was I?
Oh! Yes, of course.

2006
01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:17.089
Before I could graduate,
I was swept off my feet.

2007
01:42:17.172 --> 01:42:19.424
My husband was this, uh--

2008
01:42:21.218 --> 01:42:23.262
everything a girl's
supposed to want, right?

2009
01:42:23.345 --> 01:42:26.515
You know. I was his--
his princess.

2010
01:42:26.598 --> 01:42:30.144
He was my Prince Charming.

2011
01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.230
Can I try some of your kale?

2012
01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:37.276
- Trade you for that cherry tomato.
- All right.

2013
01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:47.536
You don't have to go on
if you don't want to.

2014
01:42:47.619 --> 01:42:49.246
No...

2015
01:42:49.329 --> 01:42:53.458
It actually feels good
to say the bad out loud.

2016
01:42:55.169 --> 01:42:59.173
But when I said
I was his princess,

2017
01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:01.800
I wasn't being metaphorical.

2018
01:43:03.218 --> 01:43:04.219
Every week,

2019
01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:07.055
a new princess costume
and a new wig.

2020
01:43:07.139 --> 01:43:08.515
"This way, I won't cheat,"

2021
01:43:08.599 --> 01:43:11.101
was the charming way he put it.

2022
01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:13.896
At first, it was...fun?

2023
01:43:13.979 --> 01:43:16.064
But then it wasn't.

2024
01:43:16.148 --> 01:43:17.649
It got rough, and I--

2025
01:43:32.497 --> 01:43:34.124
Did he hit you?

2026
01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:35.918
Aw...

2027
01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:39.213
You know, I've put
over 20 men into a coma.

2028
01:43:39.296 --> 01:43:42.299
When you're handing out
that kind of punishment--

2029
01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:44.426
The short answer is yes.

2030
01:43:44.509 --> 01:43:46.553
Yeah, he hit me.

2031
01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:48.472
And pretty much
every other verb

2032
01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:50.390
you could come up with.

2033
01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:52.351
But nothing above the neck.

2034
01:43:52.434 --> 01:43:54.478
The Princess and the Pirate.

2035
01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.730
The Princess and the Viking.

2036
01:43:56.813 --> 01:44:00.234
The Princess and
the Mongol Warlord.

2037
01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:01.777
Occasionally, he'd mix it up

2038
01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:04.446
and we'd do
The Sound of Music,

2039
01:44:04.529 --> 01:44:07.449
as if the Nazis won.

2040
01:44:07.532 --> 01:44:09.034
You know,
it couldn't be a crime.

2041
01:44:09.117 --> 01:44:10.452
He was my husband.

2042
01:44:10.535 --> 01:44:14.164
I did not complain.
I did not ask questions.

2043
01:44:14.248 --> 01:44:17.167
Although, why anyone
would want to treat

2044
01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:19.378
Julie Andrews
as a human ashtray...

2045
01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:22.589
As far as questions go,
that's a pretty good one.

2046
01:44:24.049 --> 01:44:26.134
It did improve my poetry, though.

2047
01:44:26.218 --> 01:44:28.971
It gave me a lot of good
material to work with.

2048
01:44:29.054 --> 01:44:31.431
God, you're a good listener, man.

2049
01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:33.392
You really are.

2050
01:44:34.393 --> 01:44:35.894
Oh, God-- oh.

2051
01:44:35.978 --> 01:44:38.772
Then came Valentine's Day.

2052
01:44:38.855 --> 01:44:42.109
Oh, that was on a good one.

2053
01:44:42.192 --> 01:44:45.612
My hopeless situation,
my inability to change.

2054
01:44:45.696 --> 01:44:49.241
But all in iambic
pentameter, of course.

2055
01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:54.913
And then...

2056
01:44:55.205 --> 01:44:57.291
F--

2057
01:45:13.265 --> 01:45:15.392
I should have
been happy, right?

2058
01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:18.729
They tried everything.
They couldn't wake me up.

2059
01:45:18.812 --> 01:45:21.106
They thought
I was in a coma.

2060
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:23.233
And that's when
I had the vision.

2061
01:45:53.638 --> 01:45:56.391
I had become my own
Prince Charming.

2062
01:45:56.475 --> 01:45:59.770
But there was much work
to be done in my kingdom.

2063
01:45:59.853 --> 01:46:01.897
Battles to be fought,

2064
01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.232
wars to be won.

2065
01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:09.529
You can pretty much
connect the dots from there.

2066
01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:12.908
Costumes, chemistry, poetry,

2067
01:46:12.991 --> 01:46:15.452
mutually degrading sexuality,

2068
01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:18.205
comas, "men suck."

2069
01:46:18.288 --> 01:46:20.832
I don't know how much longer
I can keep running around like this.

2070
01:46:20.916 --> 01:46:22.292
It's not like I can't afford it.

2071
01:46:22.376 --> 01:46:25.295
I mean, my husband
was Victor Rose IV.

2072
01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:27.506
Victor R-- wow.

2073
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:28.799
Small world.

2074
01:46:28.882 --> 01:46:31.343
I kind of had a one-night stand
with his grandma.

2075
01:46:31.426 --> 01:46:33.345
Granny C?

2076
01:46:33.428 --> 01:46:35.472
My story's not
as compelling as yours,

2077
01:46:35.555 --> 01:46:37.140
but, uh, exactly a year ago,

2078
01:46:37.224 --> 01:46:39.768
I received a list of everyone
I'd ever had sex with

2079
01:46:39.851 --> 01:46:41.686
and ever would have sex with.

2080
01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:44.564
I find that very compelling.

2081
01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:47.484
I-- I think we should
order dessert.

2082
01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:50.028
Raspberry tart?
Two forks?

2083
01:46:51.446 --> 01:46:53.949
You think I'm lying?

2084
01:46:54.032 --> 01:46:55.409
- You think I'm insane.
- No!

2085
01:46:55.492 --> 01:46:57.202
No. I--

2086
01:46:57.285 --> 01:46:59.454
And believe me,
I am an expert on both.

2087
01:47:00.372 --> 01:47:04.292
But Bambi and Thumper.
Seriously.

2088
01:47:04.376 --> 01:47:06.420
The Beyond-Ultimate
Lesbian Power Couple.

2089
01:47:06.503 --> 01:47:08.839
Yes. What a night.

2090
01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:13.552
Ohhh, fuck.

2091
01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:16.430
Fuck.

2092
01:47:20.475 --> 01:47:22.269
You know, uh--

2093
01:47:22.352 --> 01:47:24.146
I'd like to think that I--

2094
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:25.981
I put something
interesting out there

2095
01:47:26.064 --> 01:47:27.858
into the atmosphere.

2096
01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:30.026
You know?

2097
01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:32.612
Just the whole idea of a...

2098
01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:36.158
a woman being able
to put a man down like a dog

2099
01:47:36.241 --> 01:47:38.034
for being bad, or...

2100
01:47:39.911 --> 01:47:42.956
for no reason at all.

2101
01:47:43.039 --> 01:47:44.708
I mean, well...

2102
01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:46.668
well, women have
had to deal with

2103
01:47:46.751 --> 01:47:50.714
the anytime, anywhere
dark impulses of men

2104
01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.257
forever, so...

2105
01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:55.177
God, I thought...

2106
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:56.470
it was time to make the men

2107
01:47:56.553 --> 01:47:59.514
shake in their boots
for a while, you know?

2108
01:47:59.598 --> 01:48:02.517
I guess...

2109
01:48:02.601 --> 01:48:05.520
that's how I--
I rationalized it.

2110
01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:07.939
I-- I am gone--

2111
01:48:08.023 --> 01:48:10.275
No, that's okay.

2112
01:48:10.358 --> 01:48:12.027
We're all gone.
You know, it's--

2113
01:48:13.069 --> 01:48:17.032
So many games, names.

2114
01:48:17.115 --> 01:48:18.450
Who did you love?

2115
01:48:18.533 --> 01:48:21.244
And who did you really love?

2116
01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:23.663
Did you break their heart?

2117
01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:26.708
Or did they break yours? Or--

2118
01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:30.295
You know there's some
real bliss in there somewhere.

2119
01:48:30.378 --> 01:48:33.381
And all you're left with is...

2120
01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:36.343
exhaustion.

2121
01:48:41.097 --> 01:48:42.474
I always liked that word.

2122
01:48:46.394 --> 01:48:49.272
Oh, and "depleted,"

2123
01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:53.193
"dissipated," and "spent."

2124
01:48:53.276 --> 01:48:55.529
Those are good ones.

2125
01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:58.865
But "exhaustion..."

2126
01:48:58.949 --> 01:49:00.867
sounds like what it is.

2127
01:49:03.119 --> 01:49:05.539
And what better cure than sleep?

2128
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:08.792
Lots of sleep.

2129
01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.463
I'll get this.

2130
01:49:13.547 --> 01:49:15.465
I insist.

2131
01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:19.135
Roderick.

2132
01:49:24.933 --> 01:49:25.976
Do you mind?

2133
01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:29.145
What, do you want me
to take two,

2134
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:31.147
in case the first one
doesn't do the trick?

2135
01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:32.232
No!

2136
01:49:35.193 --> 01:49:38.613
I was just thinking,
since we're together...

2137
01:49:40.574 --> 01:49:43.827
while I'm putting one
in your mouth, you could...

2138
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.620
put one...

2139
01:49:47.539 --> 01:49:49.499
Oh.

2140
01:49:49.583 --> 01:49:52.294
You--
You sure about this?

2141
01:49:52.377 --> 01:49:53.503
Yeah.

2142
01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:54.588
You know, I'm not gonna lie.

2143
01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:56.464
I'm a little flattered.

2144
01:49:58.842 --> 01:50:01.428
You should be.

2145
01:50:02.637 --> 01:50:03.638
Go back to my room?

2146
01:50:04.681 --> 01:50:05.765
Oh, no, no, no.

2147
01:50:05.849 --> 01:50:07.726
Not that room.

2148
01:50:08.727 --> 01:50:10.270
A different room.

2149
01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:15.483
Yeah.

2150
01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:01.821
So that's it.

2151
01:51:01.905 --> 01:51:04.199
The end of my story.

2152
01:51:04.282 --> 01:51:07.285
Well, one of my stories.

2153
01:51:07.369 --> 01:51:08.286
Mommy! Daddy!

2154
01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:11.039
I found a totato for the picnic!

2155
01:51:11.122 --> 01:51:13.458
- A totato!
- Totat-- [chuckles]

2156
01:51:13.541 --> 01:51:16.503
Boy, you really are
the farmer in the family.

2157
01:51:16.586 --> 01:51:18.672
- That's--
- Let's see that.

2158
01:51:18.755 --> 01:51:21.049
I think I know what
we're having for the picnic!

2159
01:51:21.132 --> 01:51:22.717
- Make some totato soup!

2160
01:51:22.801 --> 01:51:24.969
Buddy, what do you think?
That sound good?

2161
01:51:25.053 --> 01:51:27.555
The story of how I settled down,

2162
01:51:27.639 --> 01:51:28.807
how I met my wife.

2163
01:51:31.643 --> 01:51:33.186
Of how I learned that sometimes,

2164
01:51:33.269 --> 01:51:36.648
what seem to be answers
are really questions in disguise.

2165
01:51:37.982 --> 01:51:39.526
The Machine's list
taught me the who,

2166
01:51:39.609 --> 01:51:42.362
the what, the where,
and the when

2167
01:51:42.445 --> 01:51:45.073
is never as important as the why.

2168
01:51:45.156 --> 01:51:47.742
And the why's not all
that important, either.

2169
01:51:47.826 --> 01:51:52.580
* I want to unmake every bed *

2170
01:51:52.664 --> 01:51:57.085
* That I laid down on *

2171
01:51:57.168 --> 01:52:02.382
* Give back everything I've won *

2172
01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.470
* Good days *

2173
01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:09.597
* There'll be *

2174
01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:12.684
* Bad days *

2175
01:52:14.018 --> 01:52:18.815
* I want to unread every book *

2176
01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:22.861
* That my eyes laid on *

2177
01:52:22.944 --> 01:52:25.155
If it really is all a game,

2178
01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:26.865
sometimes the best
thing you can do

2179
01:52:26.948 --> 01:52:28.825
is press the reset button.

2180
01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:34.748
* I want to unsing every song *

2181
01:52:34.831 --> 01:52:39.335
* Unwrite every line *

2182
01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:42.630
For the first time in my life, I am.

2183
01:52:42.714 --> 01:52:44.716
I dare not add an adjective--

2184
01:52:44.799 --> 01:52:48.219
mature, content, happy.

2185
01:52:48.303 --> 01:52:50.805
"I am" is good enough for now.

2186
01:52:52.015 --> 01:52:54.934
Life is a lot like death.

2187
01:52:55.018 --> 01:52:58.772
It happens to everyone,
whether they like it or not.

2188
01:52:58.855 --> 01:53:00.732
The meaning of it all?

2189
01:53:00.815 --> 01:53:02.817
Honestly?

2190
01:53:02.901 --> 01:53:04.277
Who gives a fuck?

2191
01:53:24.881 --> 01:53:29.636
* I want to unsew every seam *

2192
01:53:29.719 --> 01:53:34.057
* Unwind every clock *

2193
01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:39.395
* Unbreathe every
breath I've made *

2194
01:53:43.191 --> 01:53:47.695
* I want to unset every sun *

2195
01:53:47.779 --> 01:53:52.492
* That my eyes fell on *

2196
01:53:52.575 --> 01:53:57.831
* Till I give back all I've won *

2197
01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.878
* Good days *

2198
01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:05.880
* There'll be *

2199
01:54:05.964 --> 01:54:08.800
* Bad days *

2200
01:54:10.844 --> 01:54:12.971
* Good days *

2201
01:54:13.054 --> 01:54:15.139
* There'll be *

2202
01:54:15.223 --> 01:54:18.101
* Bad days *

2203
01:54:19.894 --> 01:54:22.105
* Good days *

2204
01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:24.315
* There'll be *

2205
01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:26.985
* Bad days *

2206
01:54:29.028 --> 01:54:31.322
* Good days *

2207
01:54:31.406 --> 01:54:33.700
* There'll be *

2208
01:54:33.783 --> 01:54:36.703
* Bad days *
