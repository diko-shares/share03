All we can do now is wait...

1244
01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:21.100
...and hope.

1246
01:56:34.739 --> 01:56:36.115
POISON IVY:
He loves me.

1247
01:56:36.741 --> 01:56:38.493
He loves me not.

1248
01:56:40.036 --> 01:56:41.621
He loves me.

1249
01:56:42.914 --> 01:56:44.916
He loves me not.

1250
01:56:47.293 --> 01:56:49.128
He loves me.

1251
01:56:50.755 --> 01:56:52.590
He loves me not.

1252
01:56:55.092 --> 01:56:56.511
He loves me.

1253
01:56:58.429 --> 01:56:59.639
MR. FREEZE:
Not!

1254
01:57:01.599 --> 01:57:03.100
Surprise.

1255
01:57:03.267 --> 01:57:05.269
I'm your new cellmate.

1256
01:57:07.522 --> 01:57:11.150
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1257
01:57:11.651 --> 01:57:14.654
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1258
01:57:18.616 --> 01:57:21.953
Winter has come at last.

1260
01:58:03.077 --> 01:58:04.620
Alfred.

1261
01:58:07.498 --> 01:58:08.541
Are you...?

1262
01:58:08.708 --> 01:58:13.337
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1263
01:58:13.838 --> 01:58:15.881
And quite well, it seems!

1264
01:58:16.090 --> 01:58:17.466
Thanks to you, son.

1265
01:58:17.675 --> 01:58:19.844
Thanks to you all.

1266
01:58:20.094 --> 01:58:21.679
Well done, Bruce.

1267
01:58:22.013 --> 01:58:24.098
You too. Well done.

1268
01:58:25.516 --> 01:58:27.018
I got one question.

1269
01:58:27.351 --> 01:58:31.022
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1270
01:58:31.188 --> 01:58:33.524
It's the first time I fell
and you weren't there.

1271
01:58:34.025 --> 01:58:35.526
I figured you could handle it.

1272
01:58:35.693 --> 01:58:40.406
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1273
01:58:43.117 --> 01:58:46.537
Excuse me. I'm the one
who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1274
01:58:46.704 --> 01:58:48.039
Yeah, that was me.

1275
01:58:48.205 --> 01:58:50.708
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1276
01:58:50.875 --> 01:58:53.210
You are going back to school.

1277
01:58:53.377 --> 01:58:55.046
You'll never win this argument.

1278
01:59:00.051 --> 01:59:01.385
Partners?

1279
01:59:06.349 --> 01:59:07.933
Partners.

1280
01:59:16.734 --> 01:59:18.444
Partners.

1281
01:59:21.906 --> 01:59:24.075
We're going to need a bigger cave.
