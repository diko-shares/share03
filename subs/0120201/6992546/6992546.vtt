73
00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:34.191

182
00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:24.101

Perry, fake left. Bertolli, you go long.

184
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:31.859
Rico, flip six, three hole. Got it?
Hey, Rico?

185
00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:33.861
-Hey!
-What?

186
00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:37.614
You're drifting!
Flip six, three hole, on one! Got it?

187
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.825
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

188
00:11:40.117 --> 00:11:41.159

He's in there. It's over.

200
00:12:32.336 --> 00:12:34.671
Who said you could grow up
so fast, huh?

201
00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.798
Mom, don't get mushy.

202
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:40.844
This came for you today.

203
00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:43.013
I presume at your request.

204
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.685
A lot of my friends
are doing Federal Service.

205
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:51.271
Well, you're not thinking of applying?

206
00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:53.190
Have you lost your mind?

207
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.108
I'd rather take ten lashes
in Public Square

208
00:12:55.192 --> 00:12:56.860
than see you ruin your life.

209
00:12:56.902 --> 00:12:58.820
It's a term of service.

210
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.948
It's not a career.

211
00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:03.909
I just want to get out on my own

212
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:07.204
see the galaxy for a couple of years.

213
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:09.706
Johnny, people get killed in
the Federal Service.

214
00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:13.043
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?

215
00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:16.880
What's his name?
You know the one I'm talking about.

216
00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:20.676
-Mr. Rasczak.
-Rasczak?

217

(SCOFFS)

218
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:24.304
Silly name.

219
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.891
There should be a law against
using a school as a recruiting station.

220
00:13:27.933 --> 00:13:30.811
No, Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

221
00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:34.064
He sort of discourages you.

222
00:13:34.231 --> 00:13:35.899
Well, that's good.

223
00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:39.152
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

224
00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:41.321
It's my decision, not yours.

225
00:13:41.613 --> 00:13:44.616
-Oh, is that how it is, huh?
-Wait, you two.

226
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.995
Dad and I have a surprise for you
that will settle this.

227
00:13:48.078 --> 00:13:50.080
Can you guess what it is?

228
00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:51.415
No.

229
00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.085
You want to see the galaxy?

230
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.380
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

231
00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:01.466
Zegema Beach. Huh?

232
00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:06.096
I've always wanted to go there.

233
00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.598
Good, good. Then it's all settled.

234
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:14.896

237
00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:34.124
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

238
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:35.959
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...

239
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:38.962
Come on.
Too bad for her if she's not around.

240
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.424
You know, it's sad,

241
00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:46.303
after tonight, most of us
probably won't see each other again.

242
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.309
So, you still gonna play for Rio?

243
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:56.813
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

244
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:59.691
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

245
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:02.736
Johnny, how come
we never got together?

246
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:09.493
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

247
00:15:11.495 --> 00:15:12.621
Sure.

248
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:18.502
-MAN: Thank you.
-Good night.

249
00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:21.963
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.

250
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.885
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

251
00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:28.553
You're the best.

252
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:44.236
-Mr. Rasczak!
-What is it, Rico?

253
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.446
I want to thank you.

254
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.949
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

255
00:15:49.032 --> 00:15:51.785
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

256
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.662
Well, I want to join up.

257
00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.539
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

258
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.624
Good for you. Go find out.

259
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.043
Well, my parents are against it.

260
00:16:00.085 --> 00:16:01.545
And I know it's my choice.

261
00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.171
I was wondering...

262
00:16:03.672 --> 00:16:06.049
What would you do if you were me?

263
00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.594
Figuring things out for yourself
is the only freedom anyone really has.

264
00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:11.263
Use that freedom.

265
00:16:11.346 --> 00:16:13.473
Make up your own mind, Rico.

266
00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:36.913
CARMEN: Don't exaggerate.

267
00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:40.458
I'm serious.
I think you have really beautiful eyes.

268
00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.377
Johnny.

269
00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.506
This is Zander.

270
00:16:46.756 --> 00:16:49.426
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

271
00:16:49.843 --> 00:16:51.344
No hard feelings?

272
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.430
No, none at all. We won.

273
00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:57.225
Come on, Carmen. It's the last dance.

274
00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:00.437
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the Academy.

275
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.189
Yeah. Who knows?

276
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:05.442
Good luck.

277
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:09.446
Zander's going for pilot too.

278
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.324
You two have so much in common.

279
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:15.285
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

280
00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:18.121
Well, maybe.

281
00:17:18.455 --> 00:17:20.916
You don't have to be jealous.

282
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:29.466
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.
There's a place for that sort of thing.

283
00:17:32.344 --> 00:17:35.513
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

284
00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.475
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.

285
00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.227
That's great.

286
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:43.647
Carl and l are signing up tomorrow.
Come with us.

287
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.981
I will.

288
00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.948
My father's not home tonight.

289
00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:18.014
-...my own free will
-...my own free will

290
00:18:18.098 --> 00:18:20.850
after having been
duly advised and warned

291
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:24.521
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath

292
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.148
enroll in the Federal Service

293
00:18:27.274 --> 00:18:29.359
for not less than two years

294
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.237
and as much longer
as may be required

295
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:34.906
by the needs of the Federation.

296
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:44.791
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh?

297
00:18:46.293 --> 00:18:47.877
So, how'd you kids do?

298
00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:49.587
I'm gonna be a pilot.

299
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.550
(CHUCKLING) Good for you!
We need all the pilots we can get.

300
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.555
-Hey, did you get starside R and D?
-No.

301
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.891
-I don't believe it.
-I got Games and Theory.

302
00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:03.768
Games and Theory?

303
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:07.147
-That's military intelligence.
-Yeah.

304
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.815
Way to go, Carl.

305
00:19:09.357 --> 00:19:12.652
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

306
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:16.948
How about you, son?

307
00:19:17.282 --> 00:19:19.492
-Infantry, sir.
-Good for you.

308
00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:22.787
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

309

00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:32.630
<i>Welcome to the adventure

312
00:19:32.714 --> 00:19:34.341
Let's make a vow.

313
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.927
No matter what,
we'll always be friends.

314
00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.221
(CHUCKLING)

315
00:19:40.263 --> 00:19:41.931
I'll go for that.

316
00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:46.394
Well, chances are
we'll never see each other again.

317
00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:50.440
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

318
00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:52.734
But, yeah, sure. Why not?

319
00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.447
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.

320
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:59.407
It may look bad,
but if that's the worst you suffer,

321
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:00.492
then that's fine.

322
00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:03.370
-I won't quit!
-I'm telling you, you will.

323
00:20:03.453 --> 00:20:05.497
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

324
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.624
I am not going on vacation!

325
00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:11.169
I want to be a citizen.
It's my decision. I made it.

326
00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.171
You walk out that door,
you are cutoff, young man.

327
00:20:13.254 --> 00:20:14.631
You understand me?

328
00:20:14.672 --> 00:20:17.133
All right, that's it! You are cutoff!

329
00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:19.177
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?

330
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.888
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?

331
00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.140
Yeah, sure.

332
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:26.226
I hope so.

333
00:20:26.476 --> 00:20:29.104
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl

334
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.022
who wants you to look handsome
in a uniform.

335
00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:33.650
-Don't talk about Carmen that way!
-Johnny.

Great.

CARMEN: Johnny.

341
00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:55.296
-RICO: You're late.
-My dad had to help me pack.

342
00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:58.258
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

343
00:20:58.341 --> 00:21:00.844
It was sweet, but it took forever.

344
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.848
Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

345
00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.435
Yeah, me too.
I'm wearing everything I own.

346
00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:13.815
I'm sorry your parents were mad.

347
00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:16.568
Who cares? The Federation
will give me everything I need

348
00:21:16.651 --> 00:21:18.862

What's it thinking, Colonel?

1563
01:56:55.759 --> 01:56:57.178
It's afraid.

1564
01:56:58.596 --> 01:57:00.014
It's afraid!

Carl! Carl! Hey!

1570
01:57:09.857 --> 01:57:12.776
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

1571
01:57:12.860 --> 01:57:16.280
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

1572
01:57:16.488 --> 01:57:18.449
Well, that's classified.

1573
01:57:20.201 --> 01:57:22.828
You know, whenever the three
of us are together,

1574
01:57:22.912 --> 01:57:25.539
I feel like things might just work out.

1575
01:57:25.623 --> 01:57:27.541
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1576
01:57:27.625 --> 01:57:30.502
We've got one of their brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1577
01:57:30.586 --> 01:57:33.172
And then we'll know how to beat them.

1578
01:57:33.297 --> 01:57:35.382
One day it will all be over

1579

that this was the moment,

1580
01:57:38.552 --> 01:57:40.471
this is when it turned.

1581
01:57:41.513 --> 01:57:45.559
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1582
01:57:49.230 --> 01:57:52.733
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

1583

Come on! Who am I?

1584

-Yeah!
-Zim?

1585
01:57:57.655 --> 01:57:59.490
He got him! Yeah!

1586
01:58:00.449 --> 01:58:02.243
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1587
01:58:02.576 --> 01:58:04.370
Zim got the bug, man!

1588
01:58:04.703 --> 01:58:07.456
-Good job, Sergeant.
-Thank you, sir.

1589
01:58:07.665 --> 01:58:10.834
That would be private, sir.
