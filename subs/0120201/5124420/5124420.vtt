00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:40.335
<i>Young people from all over the globe,</i>

2
00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:42.320
<i>are joining up to fight for the future.</i>

3
00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:43.942
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

4
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.324
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

5
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:46.563
<i>I'm doing my part.</i>

6
00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:48.938
<i>I'm doing my part too.</i>

7
00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:52.844
<i>They're doing their part, are you?</i>

8
00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:55.431
<i>Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.</i>

9
00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:57.818
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>

10
00:01:01.882 --> 00:01:04.883
<i>The bugs send another meteor our way,</i>

11
00:01:05.368 --> 00:01:07.203
<i>but this time we're ready.</i>

12
00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:09.907
<i>Planetary defences are better than ever.</i>

13
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.825
<i>Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks,</i>

14
00:01:17.908 --> 00:01:21.273
<i>orbits a twin star system whose brutal
gravitational forces...</i>

15
00:01:21.457 --> 00:01:24.460
<i>produce an unlimited supply
of bug meteorites...</i>

16
00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.971
<i>in the form of this asteroid belt.</i>

17
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.407
<i>To ensure the safety of our solar system...</i>

18
00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:32.093
<i>Klendathu must be eliminated.</i>

19
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:36.449
<i>We break net now
and take you live to Klendathu...</i>

20
00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:38.687
<i>where the invasion has begun.</i>

21
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.670
<i>EXQ uplink on, two, one.</i>

22
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:42.457
<i>You're on.</i>

23
00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:45.562
We've just landed here on
what cap troopers

24
00:01:45.846 --> 00:01:47.531
are calling Big K.

25
00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:50.202
With the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!

26
00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.239
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet!

27
00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:55.936
A planet hostile to life as we know it!

28
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:00.816
Help me!

29
00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:14.625
Come on! Go, go, go!
Keep moving!

30
00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.336
Get out of here now!

31
00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:27.311
Kitten, no!

32
00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.285
Oh, God!

33
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:41.496
Oh, God!

34
00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:57.609
Rico.

35
00:02:58.634 --> 00:02:59.673
Rico.

36
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.144
Rico!

37
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.213
Pay attention.

38
00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:09.207
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

39
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.134
Let's sum up.

40
00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:14.714
This year we explored
the failure of democracy,

41
00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:16.875
how the social scientists
brought our world

42
00:03:16.876 --> 00:03:18.409
to the brink of chaos.

43
00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.547
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control,

44
00:03:22.013 --> 00:03:25.728
and imposed the stability that has lasted
for generations since.

45
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.546
You know these facts,

46
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.124
but have I taught you
anything of value this year?

47
00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:33.738
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

48
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:35.581
It's a reward,

49
00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:38.120
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

50
00:03:38.403 --> 00:03:39.303
No.

51
00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:40.455
No!

52
00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:43.662
Something given has no value.

53
00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:47.539
Look, when you vote,
you are exercising political authority.

54
00:03:47.622 --> 00:03:48.967
You're using force.

55
00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.186
And force my friends is violence,

56
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.107
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.

57
00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.478
My mother always said violence
never solves anything.

58
00:03:58.761 --> 00:03:59.866
Really?

59
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:03.410
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

60
00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:05.329
You.

61
00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.828
They probably wouldn't say anything.

62
00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:09.517
Hiroshima was destroyed.

63
00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:10.913
Correct.

64
00:04:10.996 --> 00:04:13.366
Naked force has resolved more issues,

65
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.794
throughout history than any other factor.

66
00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:19.341
The contrary opinion,
that violence never solves anything,

67
00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.719
is wishful thinking at its worst.

68
00:04:21.802 --> 00:04:24.773
People who forget that always pay.

69
00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:28.487
Rico, what's the moral difference, if any...

70
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:30.729
between a civilian and a citizen?

71
00:04:31.512 --> 00:04:35.298
A citizen accepts personal responsibility
for the safety of the body politic,

72
00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:36.921
defending it with his life.

73
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:38.816
A civilian does not.

74
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:40.593
The exact words of the text.

75
00:04:41.452 --> 00:04:42.904
But do you understand it?

76
00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:44.370
Do you believe it?

77
00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:46.642
I don't know.

78
00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.428
Of course you don't.

79
00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.955
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue,

80
00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:53.053
if it reached up and bit you in the ass.

81
00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:11.893
Not here.

82
00:05:12.576 --> 00:05:14.662
Come on, let's see
if they posted the maths final.

83
00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:18.002
Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
We're gonna kill them.

84
00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:23.716
<i>Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.</i>

85
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.178
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your maths scores.

86
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:27.638
Wish me luck.

87
00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:37.069
Good job.

88
00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:39.237
Your turn.

89
00:05:39.662 --> 00:05:42.650
Hold on. I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

90
00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:44.910
Marco.
Hi, Carmen.

91
00:05:45.035 --> 00:05:47.498
What do you hear about Roxy?
She made pilot.

92
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.543
She did?
Oh, yeah.

93
00:05:50.627 --> 00:05:53.330
Thirty-five percent.
Very nice.

94
00:05:54.882 --> 00:05:56.051
Look at that.

95
00:05:57.576 --> 00:05:59.881
Thirty-five percent,
ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:01.134
Big numbers.

97
00:06:01.217 --> 00:06:02.851
Carl.
Sorry.

98
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.570
So, you haven't done it yet, have you?

99
00:06:11.695 --> 00:06:12.530
Don't lie.

100
00:06:12.573 --> 00:06:14.243
I'm not in any hurry.

101
00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:17.496
Others are waiting and...

102
00:06:18.956 --> 00:06:20.791
Did you read her mind?
Don't have to.

103
00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.044
It's pretty clear what she wants.

104
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.588
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

105
00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:27.443
You got it bad.

106
00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:29.304
Hey, don't forget about this afternoon.

107
00:06:29.588 --> 00:06:32.116
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

108
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:33.502
Get out of here.

109
00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.273
Marco's sister made pilot.

110
00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:37.521
So will you.

111
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.312
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

112
00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:43.323
You gotta have nerves of steel.

113
00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:46.050
Yeah, you do.
Let's see how yours hold up.

114
00:06:46.534 --> 00:06:47.744
You may begin.

115
00:06:58.808 --> 00:07:00.013
Come on, it's just a bug.

116
00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:01.304
You better put your goggles on.

117
00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:02.447
Just a bug.

118
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.977
We humans like to think
we are nature's finest achievement.

119
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.314
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

120
00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:13.762
This Arkellian sand beetle is superior
in many ways.

121
00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:16.960
It reproduces in vast numbers,

122
00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:18.685
has no ego,

123
00:07:18.986 --> 00:07:20.231
has no fear,

124
00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:22.433
doesn't now about death,

125
00:07:22.916 --> 00:07:26.795
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

126
00:07:26.836 --> 00:07:29.341
But humans have created art,
mathematics,

127
00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:30.837
and interstellar travel.

128
00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:35.081
True. But before you let that go
to your head,

129
00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:37.459
take the example of the Arachnids,

130
00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:40.897
a highly evolved insect society.

131
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.585
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid,

132
00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:48.115
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years,

133
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.702
and now...
Here, take this.

134
00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:53.006
They can colonize planets,

135
00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.210
by hurling their spore into space.

136
00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:57.846
Okay, I think we got it.

137
00:07:58.713 --> 00:07:59.964
That's the heart.

138
00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:03.385
And here's the stomach.

139
00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:10.461
Nerves of steel?

140
00:08:15.443 --> 00:08:18.239
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

141
00:08:18.322 --> 00:08:19.757
Try to visualize it.

142
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:37.015
I see the ace of spades.

143
00:08:41.436 --> 00:08:42.645
You know, statistically speaking,

144
00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:45.207
you should have accidentally guessed
right by now.

145
00:08:45.649 --> 00:08:46.859
Try another.

146
00:08:46.884 --> 00:08:49.714
So my psychic abilities
are zero and I'm unlucky.

147
00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:52.157
No, luck's not a factor.

148
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:55.321
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

149
00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.793
Who knows?
Maybe it's a new stage of human evolution.

150
00:08:58.876 --> 00:09:00.754
That's why they do these kind
of Federal studies.

151
00:09:01.837 --> 00:09:04.842
What... Cyrano...
Oh, shit. Time out.

152
00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:06.301
Oh, he just wants some attention.

153
00:09:06.384 --> 00:09:08.013
You don't play with him any more.

154
00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:09.506
Cyrano.

155
00:09:11.726 --> 00:09:13.821
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

156
00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:25.703
How do you make him do that?

157
00:09:26.286 --> 00:09:29.366
Oh, I gave him the impression there's a grub
crawling up my mom's leg.

158
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.502
He's on a mission to go eat it.

159
00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:34.628
Oh! Get out! Get off my leg!

160
00:09:35.553 --> 00:09:36.742
Oh! Carl!

161
00:09:39.387 --> 00:09:41.432
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

162
00:09:41.557 --> 00:09:42.947
Don't be afraid.

163
00:09:43.172 --> 00:09:44.227
Can't do human.

164
00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:46.369
Yet.

165
00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:55.225
All right!

166
00:10:04.301 --> 00:10:05.596
<i>Touchdown Tigers.</i>

167
00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:08.217
<i>And the score is now 41-38.</i>

168
00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:10.427
<i>Tigers lead with 2.:46 remaining,</i>

169
00:10:10.511 --> 00:10:12.681
<i>here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.</i>

170
00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:14.185
<i>Time out Giants.</i>

171
00:10:14.268 --> 00:10:16.008
Are you all right?

172
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:17.519
Much better.

173
00:10:17.979 --> 00:10:19.058
Now good.

174
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.568
All right!
Way to go, team!

175
00:10:22.151 --> 00:10:23.864
Hey!
Your helmet.

176
00:10:25.739 --> 00:10:27.534
So, what are you doing after the game?

177
00:10:29.453 --> 00:10:32.331
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?

178
00:10:33.016 --> 00:10:35.260
I don't know.
It's my last night as a civilian.

179
00:10:36.343 --> 00:10:37.932
Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

180
00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:40.169
You're going to the Fleet Academy?

181
00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:40.852
Yeah.

182
00:10:41.553 --> 00:10:42.888
That's where I want to go!

183
00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:44.841
<i>Come on, number 12! Let's play ball!</i>

184
00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:47.394
Don't get any ideas about my girlfriend!

185
00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:53.077
All is fair in love and war.

186
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.473
Johnny! Yeah!

187
00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:58.952
Hut! Hut!

188
00:11:11.216 --> 00:11:12.602
Hey, yeah!

189
00:11:12.885 --> 00:11:16.640
<i>Giants leading 43-41.
Just over 42 seconds remaining.</i>

190
00:11:20.438 --> 00:11:21.772
Yeah!
All right, let's go.

191
00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:23.774
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

192
00:11:23.858 --> 00:11:26.863
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

193
00:11:26.946 --> 00:11:29.432
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it?

194
00:11:30.257 --> 00:11:31.851
Hey, Rico?

195
00:11:32.252 --> 00:11:33.589
Hey!
What?

196
00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:34.909
You're drifting!

197
00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:37.326
Flip six, three hole, on one!
Got it?

198
00:11:37.585 --> 00:11:39.505
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

199
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.864
Ready? Break!

200
00:11:40.923 --> 00:11:41.723
Break!

201
00:11:43.592 --> 00:11:44.392
Down.

202
00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:45.885
Set.

203
00:11:46.086 --> 00:11:46.895
Tight left.

204
00:11:47.255 --> 00:11:48.259
Screen!

205
00:11:48.383 --> 00:11:49.183
Hut!

206
00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:03.536
Go, go, go!

207
00:12:06.122 --> 00:12:07.326
All right!

208
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.852
He's in there.
It's over.

209
00:12:32.198 --> 00:12:34.135
Who said you could grow up so fast.

210
00:12:34.618 --> 00:12:36.364
Mom, don't get mushy.

211
00:12:38.624 --> 00:12:40.184
This came for you today.

212
00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:42.545
I presume, at your request.

213
00:12:46.302 --> 00:12:48.329
A lot of my friends
are doing Federal Service.

214
00:12:48.512 --> 00:12:50.415
Well, you're not thinking of applying?

215
00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:52.902
Have you lost your mind?

216
00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:56.395
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square
than see you ruin your life.

217
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.234
It's a term of service.

218
00:12:58.817 --> 00:13:00.435
It's not a career.

219
00:13:00.818 --> 00:13:02.947
I just want to get out on my own...

220
00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:06.412
see the galaxy for a couple years.

221
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:09.415
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

222
00:13:09.498 --> 00:13:10.928
Who gave you this idea?

223
00:13:11.153 --> 00:13:12.677
It's that teacher, isn't it?

224
00:13:13.336 --> 00:13:14.192
What's his name?

225
00:13:14.617 --> 00:13:16.096
You know the one I'm talking about.

226
00:13:17.383 --> 00:13:18.723
Mr Rasczak.

227
00:13:19.748 --> 00:13:20.837
Rasczak?

228
00:13:22.555 --> 00:13:23.708
Silly name.

229
00:13:24.233 --> 00:13:25.629
There should be a law against
using a school

230
00:13:25.654 --> 00:13:27.045
as a recruiting station.

231
00:13:27.504 --> 00:13:28.499
No,

232
00:13:29.124 --> 00:13:30.684
Rasczak doesn't do that at all.

233
00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:33.394
He sort of discourages you.

234
00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.332
Well, that's good.

235
00:13:35.658 --> 00:13:37.660
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

236
00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:40.948
It's my decision, not yours.

237
00:13:41.331 --> 00:13:42.577
Oh, is that how it is?

238
00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:44.025
Wait, you two.

239
00:13:44.384 --> 00:13:47.407
Dad and I have a surprise for you
that will settle this.

240
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.193
Can you guess what it is?

241
00:13:50.177 --> 00:13:51.269
No.

242
00:13:52.637 --> 00:13:54.149
You wanted to see the galaxy?

243
00:13:55.642 --> 00:13:57.845
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

244
00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:00.550
Zegema Beach.

245
00:14:04.237 --> 00:14:05.779
I've always wanted to go there.

246
00:14:05.863 --> 00:14:07.750
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.

247
00:14:25.431 --> 00:14:27.767
Sure.
Don't go away.

248
00:14:27.893 --> 00:14:29.770
I'm just gonna go see Mr Rasczak.

249
00:14:31.858 --> 00:14:33.300
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

250
00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:35.527
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen.

251
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.372
Come on.
Too bad for her if she's not around.

252
00:14:41.327 --> 00:14:43.422
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...

253
00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:45.983
probably won't see each other again.

254
00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:51.516
So, you still gonna play for Rio?

255
00:14:53.761 --> 00:14:56.164
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

256
00:14:56.348 --> 00:14:58.559
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

257
00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:01.505
Johnny, how come we never got together?

258
00:15:06.653 --> 00:15:08.512
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

259
00:15:11.282 --> 00:15:12.502
Sure.

260
00:15:16.372 --> 00:15:18.291
Thank you. Good night.

261
00:15:18.374 --> 00:15:21.990
Look, Diz, I want to talk to Mr Rasczak.

262
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:26.229
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

263
00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:28.347
You're the best.

264
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.660
Mr Rasczak!

265
00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:44.534
What is it, Rico?

266
00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:46.228
I want to thank you.

267
00:15:46.287 --> 00:15:48.132
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

268
00:15:48.915 --> 00:15:51.502
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

269
00:15:51.585 --> 00:15:53.139
Well, I want to join up.

270
00:15:53.463 --> 00:15:55.341
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

271
00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:57.203
Good for you.
Go find out.

272
00:15:57.887 --> 00:15:59.804
Well, my parents are against it.

273
00:15:59.888 --> 00:16:01.316
And I know it's my choice.

274
00:16:01.599 --> 00:16:02.794
I was wondering...

275
00:16:03.478 --> 00:16:04.799
what would you do if you were me?

276
00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:07.191
Figuring things out for yourself

277
00:16:07.275 --> 00:16:09.369
is the only freedom anyone really has.

278
00:16:09.652 --> 00:16:10.929
Use that freedom.

279
00:16:11.112 --> 00:16:12.722
Make up your own mind, Rico.

280
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.476
I'm serious.
I think you have really beautiful eyes.

281
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.293
You know?
Johnny.

282
00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:46.092
This is Zander.

283
00:16:46.617 --> 00:16:48.112
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

284
00:16:49.495 --> 00:16:51.042
No hard feelings?

285
00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:53.345
No, none at all. We won.

286
00:16:54.204 --> 00:16:55.549
Come on, Carmen.

287
00:16:56.074 --> 00:16:57.198
It's the last dance.

288
00:16:58.341 --> 00:17:00.344
Well, maybe I'll see you at the Academy.

289
00:17:00.427 --> 00:17:01.621
Yeah. Who knows?

290
00:17:03.972 --> 00:17:05.009
Good luck.

291
00:17:06.434 --> 00:17:08.145
Zander's going for pilot too.

292
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.801
You two have so much in common.

293
00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:15.273
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

294
00:17:16.098 --> 00:17:17.627
Well, maybe.

295
00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:20.080
You don't have to be jealous.

296
00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.504
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

297
00:17:26.587 --> 00:17:28.690
There's a place for that sort of thing.

298
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.850
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

299
00:17:35.932 --> 00:17:37.709
I'm gonna go for Federal Service.

300
00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:39.929
That's great.

301
00:17:40.312 --> 00:17:43.033
Carl and I are signing up tomorrow.
Come with us.

302
00:17:43.317 --> 00:17:44.611
I will.

303
00:17:50.493 --> 00:17:53.065
My father's not home tonight.

304
00:18:14.107 --> 00:18:17.653
I do now, of my own free will,

305
00:18:17.778 --> 00:18:21.057
after having been duly advised
and warned,

306
00:18:21.242 --> 00:18:24.497
of the meaning
and consequences of this oath.,

307
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.833
enrol in the Federal Service,

308
00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:29.169
for not less than two years,

309
00:18:29.296 --> 00:18:32.382
and as much longer as may be required,

310
00:18:32.465 --> 00:18:34.592
by the needs of the Federation.

311
00:18:35.718 --> 00:18:37.764
All set?
Thank you.

312
00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:43.731
Fresh meat for the grinder?

313
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:47.667
So, how'd you kids do?

314
00:18:48.092 --> 00:18:49.953
I'm gonna be a pilot.

315
00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:53.460
Well, good for you.
We need all the pilots we can get.

316
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.791
Hey, did you get star side R and D?
No.

317
00:18:58.874 --> 00:19:01.339
I don't believe it.
I got Games and Theory.

318
00:19:02.422 --> 00:19:03.765
Games and Theory?

319
00:19:04.633 --> 00:19:06.895
That's military intelligence.
Yeah.

320
00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:08.572
Way to go, Carl.

321
00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:12.168
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

322
00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.405
How about you, son?

323
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:19.053
Infantry, sir.
Good for you.

324
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:22.581
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

325
00:19:32.427 --> 00:19:33.722
Let's make a vow.

326
00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.104
No matter what,

327
00:19:36.429 --> 00:19:37.892
we'll always be friends.

328
00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:41.190
I'll go for that.

329
00:19:42.858 --> 00:19:45.235
Well, chances are we'll never
see each other again.

330
00:19:46.946 --> 00:19:49.475
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

331
00:19:50.116 --> 00:19:52.620
But... yeah, sure. Why not?

332
00:19:55.165 --> 00:19:57.084
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it.

333
00:19:57.168 --> 00:20:00.046
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

334
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.050
I won't quit!
I'm telling you, you will.

335
00:20:03.133 --> 00:20:05.221
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

336
00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:07.223
I am not going on vacation!

337
00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.100
I want to be a citizen.

338
00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:10.687
It's my decision.
I made it.

339
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.770
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

340
00:20:12.773 --> 00:20:14.115
You understand me?

341
00:20:14.399 --> 00:20:16.661
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!

342
00:20:16.945 --> 00:20:18.864
Johnny, why won't you change your mind?

343
00:20:18.948 --> 00:20:21.075
Does citizenship mean that much to you?

344
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:24.038
Well, yeah, sure.

345
00:20:24.163 --> 00:20:25.882
Well, I hope so.

346
00:20:26.207 --> 00:20:28.667
I hope you don't ruin your life over
some silly little girl,

347
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.711
who wants to look handsome in a uniform.

348
00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:33.075
Don't talk about Carmen that way!
Johnny.

349
00:20:39.598 --> 00:20:40.810
Do you have everything?

350
00:20:41.394 --> 00:20:42.394
Great.

351
00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:49.779
Johnny.

352
00:20:52.242 --> 00:20:54.953
You're late.
My dad had to help me pack.

353
00:20:55.036 --> 00:20:57.832
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

354
00:20:57.914 --> 00:21:00.378
It was sweet, but it took forever.

355
00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:04.316
Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.

356
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.202
Yeah, me too.
I'm wearing everything I own.

357
00:21:11.182 --> 00:21:13.059
I'm sorry your parents were mad.

358
00:21:13.684 --> 00:21:14.692
Who cares?

359
00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:17.440
The Federation will give me everything
I need for the next two years, right?

360
00:21:19.527 --> 00:21:20.800
You talk to Carl?

361
00:21:20.925 --> 00:21:22.665
Yeah, he left this morning.

362
00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:24.796
Couldn't say where.

363
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:27.228
Oh, it's exciting, going away.

364
00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:29.742
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

365
00:21:35.006 --> 00:21:36.425
I'm gonna miss you.

366
00:21:38.428 --> 00:21:39.895
I'm gonna miss you too.

367
00:21:41.555 --> 00:21:43.000
I love you.

368
00:21:46.854 --> 00:21:48.147
That's me.

369
00:21:50.984 --> 00:21:54.949
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

370
00:21:58.662 --> 00:22:00.040
I love you.

371
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:10.020
Don't forget to write.

372
00:22:10.803 --> 00:22:12.120
I won't.

373
00:22:27.533 --> 00:22:30.077
<i>Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?</i>

374
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.454
<i>Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!</i>

375
00:22:31.496 --> 00:22:35.194
<i>Citizen rule.
People making a better tomorrow.</i>

376
00:22:44.096 --> 00:22:47.143
<i>A murderer was captured this morning
and trial today.</i>

377
00:22:47.227 --> 00:22:48.446
<i>Guilty.</i>

378
00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:52.050
<i>Sentence.: death.</i>

379
00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:55.446
<i>Execution tonight at 6:00.
All net. All channels.</i>

380
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:05.501
<i>If you think you're psychic,</i>

381
00:23:06.584 --> 00:23:07.794
<i>maybe you are.</i>

382
00:23:10.132 --> 00:23:13.177
<i>Federal studies are being conducted
in your community.</i>

383
00:23:16.515 --> 00:23:20.520
<i>Every school kid knows that Arachnids
are dangerous.</i>

384
00:23:26.109 --> 00:23:29.114
<i>However, Mormon extremists disregarded
Federal warnings,</i>

385
00:23:29.198 --> 00:23:33.495
<i>and established Fort Joe Smith deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.</i>

386
00:23:33.579 --> 00:23:37.709
<i>Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists.:</i>

387
00:23:37.835 --> 00:23:39.711
<i>Arachnids.</i>

388
00:23:45.136 --> 00:23:47.765
One, two, three, four!
Ten-hut!

389
00:23:47.848 --> 00:23:50.853
One, two, three, four!
Most of you will not,

390
00:23:50.936 --> 00:23:53.105
live to be in the Mobile Infantry.

391
00:23:53.689 --> 00:23:56.359
The trouble is,
you are not good enough the way you are.

392
00:23:56.484 --> 00:23:57.869
Hands at your side!

393
00:23:58.653 --> 00:23:59.874
Chin up.

394
00:24:00.157 --> 00:24:02.951
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!

395
00:24:03.035 --> 00:24:04.474
Suck in that gut!

396
00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:06.253
Feet together!

397
00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:10.843
To think this had to happen to me.

398
00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:13.465
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!

399
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:14.884
You don't rate that good.

400
00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:17.011
Never in my life have I seen...

401
00:24:19.765 --> 00:24:20.896
Do you think I'm funny?

402
00:24:21.321 --> 00:24:22.159
Do I make you laugh?

403
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.271
Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
I'm sorry.

404
00:24:24.813 --> 00:24:28.944
The first words and the last words
out of your stinking holes will be Sir!

405
00:24:29.028 --> 00:24:31.155
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!

406
00:24:31.238 --> 00:24:33.542
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

407
00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:36.121
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

408
00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:38.205
Bronski, keep pace!
Move! Move!

409
00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:40.792
Now, any time you think I'm being too tough...

410
00:24:40.918 --> 00:24:42.796
any time you think I'm being unfair...

411
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.340
any time you miss your mummy, quit!

412
00:24:46.424 --> 00:24:48.886
You sign form 1240-A, you grab your gear...

413
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.472
you take a stroll down Washout Lane!

414
00:24:51.555 --> 00:24:53.308
Do you get me?

415
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.444
Sir, yes, sir!
Pathetic!

416
00:24:55.729 --> 00:24:59.327
I wonder if there's a handful
of guts in the whole bunch of you.

417
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.857
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

418
00:25:05.241 --> 00:25:07.895
Sir!
I guess maybe I do, sir!

419
00:25:23.223 --> 00:25:25.476
You all right, son?
Sir, yes, sir!

420
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.514
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.

421
00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:30.819
Medic!
God.

422
00:25:31.902 --> 00:25:33.821
Pain is in your mind!

423
00:25:34.905 --> 00:25:36.325
Who's next?
Sir!

424
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:38.946
Recruit Flores reporting for duty, sir!

425
00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:52.720
You specifically requested transfer
from Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

426
00:25:52.804 --> 00:25:54.515
Sir, I heard it was the best, sir!

427
00:25:54.597 --> 00:25:56.426
It is the best.

428
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.774
What makes you think you're good enough?

429
00:26:07.657 --> 00:26:09.701
Now that's the kind of gal who makes squad leader.

430
00:26:09.784 --> 00:26:12.038
That's my job you're talking about.

431
00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:41.042
You know, I'd like to kill that Sergeant Zim.

432
00:26:41.117 --> 00:26:43.580
Whoa, improper attitude!
Watch it.

433
00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:45.790
They'll kick you out for talking like that.
Bye-bye.

434
00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:48.002
There you go down Washout Lane.

435
00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:50.464
Yup, you either got what it takes,
or you don't.

436
00:26:50.548 --> 00:26:52.757
Hey, there is a line.
Wait your turn, Ace.

437
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.313
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

438
00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:58.224
Get in line like everyone else.

439
00:27:08.361 --> 00:27:10.399
You got some guts for a rich kid.

440
00:27:11.282 --> 00:27:13.785
I guess you and me could be buddies.
What do you say?

441
00:27:15.454 --> 00:27:17.051
I'm honoured.
Hey, Hey!

442
00:27:17.176 --> 00:27:18.650
Of course you are.

443
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.836
Everybody should have a friend like me.

444
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.132
Come on, Ace back of the line now!
Back of the line!

445
00:27:23.216 --> 00:27:24.509
Back, back, back, back!

446
00:27:25.233 --> 00:27:26.278
Sir.

447
00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:29.866
Hey, Rico, want to sit together?

448
00:27:30.349 --> 00:27:31.767
No thanks, Diz.

449
00:27:34.103 --> 00:27:35.523
What's your malfunction, Rico?

450
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.861
You are.

451
00:27:39.445 --> 00:27:42.239
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

452
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.705
You think I joined the Mobile Infantry
because of you?

453
00:27:46.788 --> 00:27:48.705
You saying you didn't?

454
00:27:55.175 --> 00:27:56.325
Hi.

455
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.054
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

456
00:27:59.138 --> 00:28:02.016
What makes you even think,
you're gonna make squad leader, Rico?

457
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.668
Something I got, you don't.

458
00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:06.689
You rich kids are all the same.
It isn't about that.

459
00:28:06.773 --> 00:28:08.260
It's about who's the best.
Hey!

460
00:28:20.206 --> 00:28:21.750
Third squad!

461
00:28:28.508 --> 00:28:30.671
Sir, I don't understand.

462
00:28:31.513 --> 00:28:33.807
Who needs a knife in a nuke fight, anyway?

463
00:28:33.933 --> 00:28:35.856
All you gotta do is push a button,

464
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:37.588
sir.

465
00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:38.611
Cease fire.

466
00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:42.111
Put your hand on that wall, trooper.

467
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.658
Put your hand on that wall!

468
00:28:57.463 --> 00:28:58.800
Damn it.

469
00:29:03.806 --> 00:29:07.878
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

470
00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:12.944
Medic!

471
00:29:14.109 --> 00:29:15.780
Hand me that towel, will you?

472
00:29:15.863 --> 00:29:18.324
Ah, well, we all have one thing in common.

473
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:21.327
We were all stupid enough to sign up
for Mobile Infantry.

474
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:24.499
Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
Oh, my family's all farmers.

475
00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:26.503
I hate farming.
I mean, Mobile Infantry,

476
00:29:26.586 --> 00:29:28.503
It's like pure picnic by comparison.

477
00:29:28.587 --> 00:29:32.051
All right, so they grow them big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?

478
00:29:32.093 --> 00:29:34.071
And pretty!
I like big!

479
00:29:34.555 --> 00:29:35.780
Djana'D, what about you?

480
00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:38.164
Oh, I'm going in for politics and you know,

481
00:29:38.189 --> 00:29:39.709
you gotta be a citizen for that.

482
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:40.705
So here I am.

483
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.880
You want some responsibility.

484
00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.889
Yeah.

485
00:29:44.013 --> 00:29:46.162
Shujimi, come on, let's keep it going.

486
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.781
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.

487
00:29:48.782 --> 00:29:50.233
It's gonna cost an arm and a leg,
you know?

488
00:29:50.358 --> 00:29:53.282
So, if I serve,
Federation pays my way.

489
00:29:54.665 --> 00:29:56.042
I want to have babies.

490
00:29:56.123 --> 00:29:58.961
You know, it's a lot easier to get
a license if you've served. So...

491
00:29:59.186 --> 00:30:00.237
I'm going career.

492
00:30:00.297 --> 00:30:02.009
Officer's training.
All the way.

493
00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:04.101
Future Sky Marshal.

494
00:30:04.626 --> 00:30:05.811
Hey Rico, your turn.

495
00:30:08.014 --> 00:30:09.392
Who asked you to be so nosy?

496
00:30:09.576 --> 00:30:11.661
What? I'm the-the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

497
00:30:11.686 --> 00:30:13.299
A writer's got a right to be nosy.

498
00:30:14.482 --> 00:30:17.278
Hey, Flores, you know Rico
from Buenos Aires.

499
00:30:17.362 --> 00:30:18.376
What's his story?

500
00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:23.261
He's here because of a girl.

501
00:30:25.494 --> 00:30:27.683
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

502
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:30.993
He's getting me excited.

503
00:30:31.218 --> 00:30:32.486
He's gonna blow.

504
00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:37.179
Is it you?

505
00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:45.040
<i>This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.</i>

506
00:30:46.022 --> 00:30:48.937
<i>Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.</i>

507
00:30:51.198 --> 00:30:52.783
<i>Boot's pretty tough.</i>

508
00:30:52.907 --> 00:30:54.836
<i>Sometimes I think I won't make it.</i>

509
00:30:55.619 --> 00:30:57.739
<i>But then I think about what you're doing,
and I try harder.</i>

510
00:31:08.594 --> 00:31:09.606
<i>Who knows?</i>

511
00:31:09.631 --> 00:31:11.567
<i>They might even make
me squad leader.</i>

512
00:31:13.668 --> 00:31:14.777
<i>I better pack it in.</i>

513
00:31:18.274 --> 00:31:20.245
<i>Write me!
I love you so much</i>

514
00:31:22.028 --> 00:31:24.458
<i>I'm gonna kill you guys!
I love you so much</i>

515
00:31:27.579 --> 00:31:28.788
<i>Bye! Write me. Bye!</i>

516
00:31:30.667 --> 00:31:31.953
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

517
00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:34.672
First one there gets to fly.

518
00:31:50.357 --> 00:31:52.368
Locking it down.
Wait! Wait!

519
00:31:54.613 --> 00:31:56.250
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.

520
00:31:56.275 --> 00:31:57.291
She's crazy!

521
00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.895
Ready, go!

522
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.761
Deploying wings.

523
00:32:54.901 --> 00:32:56.680
How come you're in such a good mood?

524
00:32:57.363 --> 00:32:59.242
'Cause today I get to fly that.

525
00:33:22.687 --> 00:33:25.066
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.

526
00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:26.985
Take the number two chair, Ibanez.

527
00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:28.363
Yes, ma'am.

528
00:33:32.701 --> 00:33:33.731
Identify.

529
00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:37.699
<i>Ibanez, T-325-A, clear.</i>

530
00:33:42.966 --> 00:33:44.952
What are you doing here?

531
00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:49.016
I'm the guy whose gonna teach you
to fly this crate.

532
00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:51.893
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

533
00:33:52.979 --> 00:33:54.339
Should I call you sir?

534
00:33:55.523 --> 00:33:58.485
Only when I give you an order.
Prepare for departure.

535
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:02.476
It's amazing,
us running into each other like this.

536
00:34:03.659 --> 00:34:04.956
Maybe it's fate.

537
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.353
Maybe not.

538
00:34:06.496 --> 00:34:09.466
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

539
00:34:09.749 --> 00:34:10.867
Solid maths,

540
00:34:10.892 --> 00:34:12.598
a little wild on the stick,

541
00:34:12.622 --> 00:34:13.870
but a natural.

542
00:34:14.506 --> 00:34:15.925
And when it turned out to be you,

543
00:34:16.009 --> 00:34:18.262
I just made sure that we would run
into each other.

544
00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:21.016
<i>Rodger Young cleared
for undocking and departure.</i>

545
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.534
All right, Ibanez.

546
00:34:22.818 --> 00:34:24.008
Take her out.

547
00:34:24.233 --> 00:34:25.322
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:34:26.688 --> 00:34:28.009
<i>All systems go.</i>

549
00:34:52.515 --> 00:34:55.644
In simulation,
my supervisors could never keep up.

550
00:34:56.228 --> 00:34:58.023
Well, this isn't simulation any more,

551
00:34:58.106 --> 00:35:00.194
so take her out easy, cadet.

552
00:35:00.777 --> 00:35:02.111
Yes, sir.

553
00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:12.709
<i>Five metres from object.</i>

554
00:35:15.837 --> 00:35:17.421
<i>Three metres from object.</i>

555
00:35:22.138 --> 00:35:23.313
<i>Clear.</i>

556
00:35:26.517 --> 00:35:28.009
Don't exceed port speed.

557
00:35:28.234 --> 00:35:29.305
Or what?

558
00:35:29.565 --> 00:35:31.901
Or they revoke your flight status,

559
00:35:32.926 --> 00:35:34.104
and mine.

560
00:35:35.932 --> 00:35:37.767
Your career is in my hands.

561
00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:46.962
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

562
00:35:47.003 --> 00:35:48.080
Prepare for warp.

563
00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:49.180
Yes, ma'am.

564
00:35:49.281 --> 00:35:51.194
Number One, design for Jupiter orbit.

565
00:35:52.677 --> 00:35:56.516
<i>All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.</i>

566
00:35:56.558 --> 00:35:57.978
Star drive in...

567
00:35:58.503 --> 00:36:00.122
five... four...

568
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.301
ready... steady... go!

569
00:36:28.391 --> 00:36:30.028
We're going in! Move!

570
00:36:39.323 --> 00:36:40.741
Man, they're defended no way in.

571
00:36:43.204 --> 00:36:44.839
Flip six, three hole.
What?

572
00:36:45.623 --> 00:36:47.818
You run a flip six three hole play,
and you can score.

573
00:36:48.501 --> 00:36:49.736
Cover me.
Got it.

574
00:36:58.348 --> 00:36:59.432
Now!

575
00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:07.566
Thanks, buddy.

576
00:37:07.991 --> 00:37:09.153
Bastard!

577
00:37:25.075 --> 00:37:26.519
Kid's got some moves.

578
00:37:27.103 --> 00:37:28.981
Give him a squad, see what he can do.

579
00:37:34.029 --> 00:37:35.123
Kitty, Kitty.

580
00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:38.166
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

581
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:40.979
Look at him.

582
00:37:41.162 --> 00:37:43.517
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

583
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.429
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brown-nose.

584
00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:50.091
All right, where were we?

585
00:37:53.762 --> 00:37:55.498
I couldn't have done it without you, Diz.

586
00:37:57.519 --> 00:37:58.612
Friends?

587
00:38:01.648 --> 00:38:02.709
Friends.

588
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.803
Mail call! Levy!
Yeah, that's me.

589
00:38:07.029 --> 00:38:08.675
Shujimi!
Here.

590
00:38:09.701 --> 00:38:10.877
Rico.
Here.

591
00:38:11.203 --> 00:38:13.245
Breckinridge!
Yeah, right here.

592
00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:15.959
Niler. Yeah, here I am.
Ah, great, my dad.

593
00:38:16.542 --> 00:38:17.804
That's all, folks.

594
00:38:26.013 --> 00:38:27.273
<i>Hi, Johnny.</i>

595
00:38:27.556 --> 00:38:29.901
<i>I'm sorry I haven't written you sooner, but...</i>

596
00:38:30.185 --> 00:38:32.815
Oh, Rico, you don't deserve that!
<i>It's been really busy.</i>

597
00:38:32.898 --> 00:38:34.758
<i>They've really got us going here.</i>

598
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:37.145
<i>They must have made you squad leader by now.</i>

599
00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:39.990
<i>And if they haven't, tell them to talk to me.</i>

600
00:38:40.074 --> 00:38:42.284
See?
All it takes is the love of a good woman.

601
00:38:42.409 --> 00:38:44.830
Yeah. That is a woman.

602
00:38:44.913 --> 00:38:46.527
<i>Look at that.</i>

603
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:49.626
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

604
00:38:49.711 --> 00:38:51.239
<i>I love it out here.</i>

605
00:38:54.093 --> 00:38:55.678
<i>That's also the problem.</i>

606
00:38:56.563 --> 00:38:57.643
<i>Because...</i>

607
00:38:58.468 --> 00:39:00.700
<i>I think I'm gonna go career.</i>

608
00:39:02.353 --> 00:39:05.691
<i>I want to command,
a ship of my own you know...</i>

609
00:39:08.445 --> 00:39:11.192
<i>I don't think that's gonna leave a lot
for you and me Johnny.</i>

610
00:39:15.496 --> 00:39:17.800
<i>I know that's not what you wanted to hear.</i>

611
00:39:19.085 --> 00:39:20.136
<i>But...</i>

612
00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:23.898
<i>I have to follow my heart.</i>

613
00:39:26.123 --> 00:39:27.192
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

614
00:39:29.013 --> 00:39:30.558
<i>Write me, all right?</i>

615
00:39:31.941 --> 00:39:34.428
<i>Write me so that I know we'll
always be friends.</i>

616
00:39:53.169 --> 00:39:54.505
Funny how they always want to be friends

617
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.025
after they rip your guts out?

618
00:39:57.508 --> 00:40:00.103
Yeah. Well, it's what I deserve.

619
00:40:01.807 --> 00:40:03.483
What are you talking about?

620
00:40:05.562 --> 00:40:07.438
Oh, I joined up for her.

621
00:40:08.816 --> 00:40:11.026
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

622
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.605
What are you talking about?
You made squad leader on your own.

623
00:40:16.742 --> 00:40:19.089
And, hey, you still got me to kick around.

624
00:40:24.003 --> 00:40:25.422
Fun and games are over, children.

625
00:40:25.505 --> 00:40:27.549
You will be firing live ammunition,

626
00:40:27.633 --> 00:40:29.827
in a simulated combat environment.

627
00:40:29.851 --> 00:40:34.275
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

628
00:40:34.276 --> 00:40:37.029
Do you get me?
Sir, yes, sir!

629
00:40:37.312 --> 00:40:39.146
Rico, take them out!

630
00:40:40.366 --> 00:40:43.536
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

631
00:40:43.619 --> 00:40:46.357
Maximum score has been 280.

632
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:48.682
I expect you to do better!

633
00:40:49.507 --> 00:40:50.486
Go!

634
00:40:58.724 --> 00:41:00.177
Shujimi, stay down!

635
00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:12.867
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

636
00:41:12.992 --> 00:41:14.854
It's my helmet! It's all screwed up!

637
00:41:15.037 --> 00:41:16.790
You're gonna blow the score!

638
00:41:16.873 --> 00:41:18.415
Damn! Dumb shit!

639
00:41:18.499 --> 00:41:19.918
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?

640
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.795
Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
Give it to me.

641
00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.133
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

642
00:41:24.216 --> 00:41:25.674
It must be 'cause I'm big and dumb!

643
00:41:25.758 --> 00:41:27.344
Yeah, right!

644
00:41:33.394 --> 00:41:35.314
Medic!

645
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:41.497
Rico, you are relieved of squad command!

646
00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:46.644
Rico, did you give the recruit permission
to remove his helmet?

647
00:41:46.827 --> 00:41:47.868
Sir, yes, sir.

648
00:41:48.093 --> 00:41:50.190
Breckinridge reported
a helmet malfunction,

649
00:41:50.198 --> 00:41:51.769
and I asked him to show it to me, sir.

650
00:41:51.844 --> 00:41:55.598
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

651
00:41:56.966 --> 00:41:58.269
Sir, no, sir!

652
00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:00.553
Then why did you order your
man to remove his helmet,

653
00:42:00.554 --> 00:42:03.099
during a live fire exercise?

654
00:42:03.224 --> 00:42:06.439
Sir, I needed everyone
in my squad operational, sir!

655
00:42:07.939 --> 00:42:09.817
I wanted to win, sir!

656
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.661
Carry on.

657
00:42:25.087 --> 00:42:28.318
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

658
00:42:29.801 --> 00:42:32.690
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

659
00:42:34.683 --> 00:42:36.059
Yes, sir, I do.

660
00:42:37.395 --> 00:42:38.529
All right.

661
00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:42.111
We'll try administrative punishment.

662
00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:49.787
Prisoner, halt!

663
00:43:07.684 --> 00:43:09.305
Bite down on this, son.

664
00:43:09.688 --> 00:43:12.190
It helps. I know.

665
00:43:22.539 --> 00:43:25.583
<i>For incompetence of command,</i>

666
00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:28.336
<i>for failure to abide by safety regulations</i>

667
00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.860
<i>during a live fire exercise,</i>

668
00:43:31.927 --> 00:43:35.254
<i>for negligence which contributed

00:43:36.039 --> 00:43:38.092
<i>recruit trainee John Rico,</i>

670
00:43:38.117 --> 00:43:40.202
<i>is sentenced to administrative punishment.</i>

671
00:43:41.731 --> 00:43:42.897
<i>Ten lashes.</i>

672
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.719
<i>You may carry out the sentence.</i>

673
00:43:54.079 --> 00:43:55.166
One!

674
00:43:57.751 --> 00:43:58.896
Two!

675
00:44:01.588 --> 00:44:02.666
Three!

676
00:44:04.969 --> 00:44:06.289
Four!

677
00:44:08.889 --> 00:44:09.975
Five!

678
00:44:13.062 --> 00:44:14.148
Six!

679
00:44:16.066 --> 00:44:17.135
Seven!

680
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:20.116
Eight!

681
00:44:21.783 --> 00:44:22.875
Nine!

682
00:44:24.703 --> 00:44:25.722
Ten!

683
00:44:38.471 --> 00:44:41.517
<i>All sections secure.
EBS is high normal.</i>

684
00:44:41.601 --> 00:44:44.419
<i>Switching to slave on my mark. Mark.</i>

685
00:44:48.442 --> 00:44:50.321
Thanks. You read my mind.

686
00:44:52.114 --> 00:44:54.944
Oh, third watch always seems to last forever.

687
00:44:55.369 --> 00:44:56.896
I don't know.

688
00:44:57.121 --> 00:44:59.283
It depends on who you're spending it with.

689
00:45:02.336 --> 00:45:03.673
Something's wrong.

690
00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:09.680
There.

691
00:45:09.705 --> 00:45:12.082
No, I replotted the course.

692
00:45:12.724 --> 00:45:14.196
It's more efficient this way.

693
00:45:14.396 --> 00:45:18.076
Three weeks aboard a starship
and you think that you can lick my navs?

694
00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:19.566
Check it.

695
00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:27.227
You know, I was talking with Captain Deladier,

696
00:45:27.911 --> 00:45:29.413
and she said...

697
00:45:29.496 --> 00:45:33.218
Don't change the subject.
Am I right?

698
00:45:40.845 --> 00:45:41.636
Yeah.

699
00:45:42.661 --> 00:45:43.774
You're right.

700
00:45:44.333 --> 00:45:46.027
So, what did the captain say?

701
00:45:47.687 --> 00:45:50.441
She thinks to team up officially...

702
00:45:52.485 --> 00:45:53.838
and crew for her.

703
00:45:55.322 --> 00:45:56.274
You and me?

704
00:45:56.799 --> 00:45:58.494
We're good together, Carmen.

705
00:45:58.953 --> 00:46:01.548
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

706
00:46:02.331 --> 00:46:04.735
I can anticipate you.

707
00:46:05.418 --> 00:46:07.815
You know what I want.

708
00:46:09.883 --> 00:46:10.697
No.

709
00:46:11.722 --> 00:46:13.263
What do you want?

710
00:46:20.981 --> 00:46:22.818
There's a gravity field out there.

711
00:46:25.113 --> 00:46:27.908
Run a scan. Sensors on. There.

712
00:46:30.036 --> 00:46:33.331
Gravity at 225 and rising.
<i>Report.</i>

713
00:46:33.456 --> 00:46:35.375
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object,

714
00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.128
moving toward us at high speed.

715
00:46:37.252 --> 00:46:39.248
Profile suggests an asteroid, ma'am.

716
00:46:51.813 --> 00:46:54.484
Impact, six seconds!
<i>Emergency evasion!</i>

717
00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.036
Three, two,

718
00:47:05.124 --> 00:47:06.131
fire!

719
00:47:21.310 --> 00:47:22.663
Close compartment 21!

720
00:47:37.165 --> 00:47:38.626
Where'd it come from?

721
00:47:38.709 --> 00:47:41.544
It came out of the
Arachnid Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

722
00:47:43.507 --> 00:47:46.385
Number Four, contact Fleet.
Tell them there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

723
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:48.638
Communications are down, ma'am.
They're gone.

724
00:47:50.307 --> 00:47:53.068
Damage assessment.
Hull's compromised.

725
00:47:53.353 --> 00:47:54.855
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

726
00:47:54.939 --> 00:47:56.815
Luck didn't have anything to do with it.

727
00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.887
We have a hell of a flight team.

728
00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:16.918
It really stinks, you going.

729
00:48:17.843 --> 00:48:20.681
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry will just have
to get along without me.

730
00:48:24.895 --> 00:48:26.280
I don't get it, Rico.

731
00:48:26.505 --> 00:48:27.755
You took your licks.

732
00:48:27.814 --> 00:48:29.484
They would have kicked you out.

733
00:48:29.768 --> 00:48:30.944
Hey!

734
00:48:32.445 --> 00:48:34.565
I joined up for the wrong reasons,
I got a guy killed.

735
00:48:34.574 --> 00:48:36.911
I figure that kind of proves,
I don't have what it takes.

736
00:48:36.995 --> 00:48:40.441
Rico, your call's going through.

737
00:48:40.624 --> 00:48:41.902
Take it there.

738
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:49.551
<i>Hello?</i>

739
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:51.850
<i>Oh, Johnny!</i>

740
00:48:52.075 --> 00:48:53.114
Hi, Mom.

741
00:48:53.172 --> 00:48:55.017
<i>Bill, pick it up. It's Johnny!</i>

742
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.695
<i>Johnny?</i>
Dad.

743
00:48:56.978 --> 00:48:58.357
<i>Where's your uniform?
Bill.</i>

744
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:02.009
<i>It's just good to hear from you.</i>

745
00:49:02.193 --> 00:49:03.788
<i>How are you, son?</i>

746
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:06.782
It's not really working
out here for me, Dad.

747
00:49:06.866 --> 00:49:08.010
I was thinking...

748
00:49:08.536 --> 00:49:10.213
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

749
00:49:10.497 --> 00:49:13.542
<i>Well, of-of course.
You should come home immediately.</i>

750
00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:17.215
I'm sorry. I've been an idiot.

751
00:49:17.298 --> 00:49:19.392
<i>Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...</i>

752
00:49:19.676 --> 00:49:20.843
<i>talk things out.</i>

753
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.806
<i>We love you, son.</i>

754
00:49:25.308 --> 00:49:27.851
<i>My, what's that?
Looks like rain.</i>

755
00:49:27.977 --> 00:49:30.448
<i>This time of year?
Sure is dark.</i>

756
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:32.442
<i>Your transmission has been terminated,</i>

757
00:49:32.524 --> 00:49:34.870
<i>due to atmospheric interference.</i>

758
00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:36.613
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

759
00:49:43.331 --> 00:49:44.717
Well, see ya.

760
00:49:45.001 --> 00:49:45.857
Hey,

761
00:49:46.882 --> 00:49:48.548
you take that stroll
down Washout Lane,

762
00:49:48.606 --> 00:49:50.040
you're only proving one thing, Johnny.

763
00:49:50.424 --> 00:49:51.718
What's that, Diz?

764
00:49:55.348 --> 00:49:57.686
That you don't have
what it takes to be a citizen.

765
00:50:27.056 --> 00:50:28.558
What's happening?

766
00:50:34.232 --> 00:50:35.650
Hey, hey, what's going on?

767
00:50:35.734 --> 00:50:37.045
What's going on?

768
00:50:37.529 --> 00:50:41.057
Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
It's war! We're going to war!

769
00:50:45.539 --> 00:50:49.110
<i>The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.</i>

770
00:50:49.293 --> 00:50:54.174
<i>Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.</i>

771
00:50:54.257 --> 00:50:55.744
Is that Geneva?

772
00:50:56.428 --> 00:50:58.264
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

773
00:50:58.348 --> 00:51:01.685
<i>The meteor was shot out
of orbit by bug plasma...</i>

774
00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:05.190
<i>that derived from Klendathu,
the Arachnids home planet.</i>

775
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:17.455
<i>Nothing lives in what was once
called the Latin Paradise.</i>

776
00:51:17.539 --> 00:51:18.874
Oh, Johnny, it's us.

777
00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:22.462
<i>Buenos Aires has been wiped off the Earth.</i>

778
00:51:27.218 --> 00:51:28.803
That's home.

779
00:51:31.306 --> 00:51:34.312
<i>The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...</i>

780
00:51:34.395 --> 00:51:38.275
<i>for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.</i>

781
00:51:45.034 --> 00:51:47.162
I'm serious. I'll go anywhere. Forget it, Zim.
We need you here.

782
00:51:47.245 --> 00:51:50.164
I want combat, sir.
The only way you're gonna see combat,

783
00:51:50.247 --> 00:51:52.168
is if you bust yourself to private!

784
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.656
Get me?
Yes, sir, I get you.

785
00:51:55.339 --> 00:51:56.321
Sir!

786
00:51:57.646 --> 00:51:58.791
What do you want, Rico?

787
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.197
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

788
00:52:01.679 --> 00:52:03.767
You already signed your 1240-A, son.

789
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.192
It wouldn't be legal.

790
00:52:05.417 --> 00:52:07.245
Major, I know it was wrong.

791
00:52:07.604 --> 00:52:09.960
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.

792
00:52:10.443 --> 00:52:12.161
You made your decision, son.

793
00:52:12.444 --> 00:52:14.145
Sir, my family,

794
00:52:14.446 --> 00:52:16.699
my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

795
00:52:20.039 --> 00:52:21.825
Is this your signature, Rico?

796
00:52:23.208 --> 00:52:24.679
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

797
00:52:29.551 --> 00:52:31.605
Doesn't look like it to me.

798
00:52:35.057 --> 00:52:36.693
Carry on, Private!

799
00:52:36.718 --> 00:52:38.105
Yes, sir!

800
00:52:50.816 --> 00:52:54.963
<i>Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow,</i>

801
00:52:55.988 --> 00:52:57.616
<i>then anger.</i>

802
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.363
<i>The only good bug is a dead bug.</i>

803
00:53:00.746 --> 00:53:03.532
<i>In Geneva, the Federal Council convenes.</i>

804
00:53:03.916 --> 00:53:06.302
<i>We must meet the threat
with our valour,</i>

805
00:53:06.727 --> 00:53:07.655
<i>our blood,</i>

806
00:53:07.664 --> 00:53:09.673
<i>indeed, with our very lives,</i>

807
00:53:10.007 --> 00:53:12.953
<i>to ensure that human civilization,</i>

808
00:53:13.378 --> 00:53:14.520
<i>not insect,</i>

809
00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.559
<i>dominates this galaxy, now and always!</i>

810
00:53:19.853 --> 00:53:21.440
<i>Sky Marshal Dienes announces plans,</i>

811
00:53:21.523 --> 00:53:23.382
<i>for an offensive against Klendathu,</i>

812
00:53:23.566 --> 00:53:26.946
<i>source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.</i>

813
00:53:29.534 --> 00:53:33.397
<i>Every day, Federal scientists are looking
for new ways to kill bugs.</i>

814
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:36.418
<i>Your basic Arachnid warrior isn't too smart,</i>

815
00:53:36.501 --> 00:53:37.876
<i>but you can blow off a limb...</i>

816
00:53:40.672 --> 00:53:43.302
<i>and it's still 86 percent combat effective.</i>

817
00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.424
<i>Here's a tip.</i>

818
00:53:44.449 --> 00:53:47.262
<i>Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.</i>

819
00:53:53.857 --> 00:53:56.687
<i>Everyone's doing their part. Are you?</i>

820
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:01.659
<i>Die! Die!
The war effort needs your effort...</i>

821
00:54:01.743 --> 00:54:03.995
<i>at work, at home, in your community.</i>

822
00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:09.670
<i>We now break net and take you live,</i>

823
00:54:09.753 --> 00:54:12.091
<i>to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga,</i>

824
00:54:12.132 --> 00:54:14.675
<i>deep inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone,</i>

825
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.866
<i>where the men and women
of the Federal Armed Services,</i>

826
00:54:18.091 --> 00:54:19.232
<i>prepare to attack.</i>

827
00:54:19.391 --> 00:54:22.503
<i>D XQ uplink on two, one.</i>

828
00:54:22.604 --> 00:54:23.635
<i>You're on.</i>

829
00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:25.890
No one here in the AQZ knows exactly

830
00:54:25.894 --> 00:54:28.104
when the invasion of Klendathu will occur.

831
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:29.862
But everyone's talking about it,

832
00:54:29.946 --> 00:54:31.864
and the talk says tomorrow.

833
00:54:31.948 --> 00:54:34.869
Here's a bunch of MI kids that look like
they could eat bugs for lunch.

834
00:54:34.952 --> 00:54:36.371
Yum, yum, yum.

835
00:54:36.555 --> 00:54:38.667
So, trooper, you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

836
00:54:38.749 --> 00:54:41.460
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.

837
00:54:41.543 --> 00:54:44.532
Am I right?
I just hope it's not over before we get some.

838
00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:46.552
Okay, come on.
Some say the bugs were provoked

839
00:54:46.635 --> 00:54:49.303
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat,

840
00:54:49.387 --> 00:54:53.394
that a live and let live policy
is preferable to war with the bugs.

841
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.754
Let me tell you something.

842
00:54:54.938 --> 00:54:57.023
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!

843
00:54:57.106 --> 00:54:58.483
Yeah! Go on, trooper!
Yeah!

844
00:54:58.566 --> 00:54:59.743
Yeah!
Oh, yeah!

845
00:55:00.067 --> 00:55:01.547
Big bad bugs?

846
00:55:02.072 --> 00:55:04.073
Hey, guys, we ought to get tattoos.

847
00:55:04.199 --> 00:55:05.576
Hey, let's all get cut together.
Yeah.

848
00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:06.995
What do I want a tattoo for?
Oh, what?

849
00:55:07.079 --> 00:55:08.665
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.

850
00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:09.981
Hey, Johnny!

851
00:55:12.376 --> 00:55:13.955
Johnny Rico.

852
00:55:16.091 --> 00:55:17.382
Carmen?

853
00:55:21.788 --> 00:55:23.083
At ease.

854
00:55:23.267 --> 00:55:25.312
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.

855
00:55:26.295 --> 00:55:27.798
Hi, Diz.

856
00:55:28.323 --> 00:55:29.476
Carmen.

857
00:55:32.403 --> 00:55:33.732
My mother was right about you.

858
00:55:35.114 --> 00:55:36.751
You look great in a uniform.

859
00:55:37.035 --> 00:55:38.953
You look pretty good yourself.

860
00:55:40.788 --> 00:55:42.208
So, what do you hear?

861
00:55:42.833 --> 00:55:45.753
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?

862
00:55:45.878 --> 00:55:47.967
Most of the time I don't think about it.

863
00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:50.177
Like it happened to someone else.

864
00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.954
Then it hits me, and I...

865
00:55:52.278 --> 00:55:53.873
can't stop crying.

866
00:55:54.557 --> 00:55:57.255
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.

867
00:55:58.397 --> 00:56:00.291
You don't look very happy to see me.

868
00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:03.010
Should I be?

869
00:56:04.235 --> 00:56:05.324
Johnny,

870
00:56:05.849 --> 00:56:07.642
it's different now.

871
00:56:08.367 --> 00:56:10.689
We're at war, I mean,
I think what I did was probably

872
00:56:10.713 --> 00:56:12.348
the best thing for both of us.

873
00:56:13.249 --> 00:56:15.377
Everything copacetic, Lieutenant?

874
00:56:16.418 --> 00:56:18.540
Zander, you remember Johnny.

875
00:56:18.924 --> 00:56:20.975
Zander and I are a flight team now.

876
00:56:21.258 --> 00:56:23.012
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

877
00:56:24.431 --> 00:56:25.799
I get it.

878
00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.119
This is the part that's best for both of us.

879
00:56:29.144 --> 00:56:30.660
Don't do me any more favours.

880
00:56:30.885 --> 00:56:31.831
Johnny, wait.

881
00:56:31.832 --> 00:56:33.928
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.

882
00:56:34.111 --> 00:56:36.028
See, when you're trained to kill,

883
00:56:36.111 --> 00:56:37.632
it just doesn't pay to be polite.

884
00:56:38.615 --> 00:56:40.828
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

885
00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:42.689
I think you heard me.

886
00:56:43.915 --> 00:56:45.467
You want to make something of it,

887
00:56:45.892 --> 00:56:46.842
Private?

888
00:56:48.754 --> 00:56:50.666
Not with an officer. No, sir.

889
00:56:51.091 --> 00:56:52.928
The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers.

890
00:56:53.253 --> 00:56:54.869
Well, let's disregard rank.

891
00:56:54.929 --> 00:56:55.683
Zander, please.

892
00:56:55.708 --> 00:56:57.164
Let it go, Rico. Let it go.

893
00:56:57.224 --> 00:56:58.584
Everybody hear that?

894
00:56:58.709 --> 00:57:00.753
Rank is not an issue here.

895
00:57:00.811 --> 00:57:01.767
Don't do this.

896
00:57:01.792 --> 00:57:03.539
Come on. What's he gonna do?

897
00:57:17.749 --> 00:57:20.294
Come on, jarheads!

898
00:57:20.378 --> 00:57:22.213
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!

899
00:57:23.884 --> 00:57:27.805
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

900
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.516
Guys! Guys! Quit it!
Come on! Come on!

901
00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.919
He's not worth it!
Come on! Come on!

902
00:57:31.102 --> 00:57:32.770
Let's get... Come on!

903
00:57:32.854 --> 00:57:33.818
Forget it, Rico!

904
00:57:34.043 --> 00:57:36.775
Mobile Infantry and Fleet don't mix.
Come on.

905
00:57:38.903 --> 00:57:40.372
Come on, let's go.

906
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:43.936
Jarheads.

907
00:57:46.537 --> 00:57:48.950
Mobile Infantry rules!
Yeah!

908
00:57:49.375 --> 00:57:51.420
Oh, God, that hurts.

909
00:57:51.504 --> 00:57:54.590
Hey, well, I got something that might hurt
just a little bit more, buddy.

910
00:57:56.217 --> 00:57:57.073
Oh, yeah!

911
00:57:57.098 --> 00:57:59.464
We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!

912
00:58:17.454 --> 00:58:19.064
<i>This is the captain speaking.</i>

913
00:58:19.088 --> 00:58:21.058
<i>All personnel prepare for drop.</i>

914
00:58:21.541 --> 00:58:23.762
<i>We are at D-minus three and counting.</i>

915
00:58:35.436 --> 00:58:37.724
We are going in with first wave.

916
00:58:38.608 --> 00:58:40.035
Means more bugs for us to kill.

917
00:58:40.776 --> 00:58:42.321
You smash the entire area.

918
00:58:42.405 --> 00:58:44.490
You kill anything that
has more than two legs.

919
00:58:44.573 --> 00:58:45.507
You get me?

920
00:58:45.532 --> 00:58:46.860
We get you, sir!

921
00:59:35.139 --> 00:59:36.612
Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.

922
00:59:36.837 --> 00:59:37.802
Bug batteries.

923
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:40.697
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

924
00:59:42.266 --> 00:59:43.539
Drop status?

925
00:59:43.564 --> 00:59:44.835
Drop is...

926
00:59:44.936 --> 00:59:46.980
35 percent complete, ma'am.

927
00:59:52.531 --> 00:59:53.948
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

928
01:00:06.382 --> 01:00:11.137
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

929
01:00:28.994 --> 01:00:30.489
This isn't random or light.

930
01:00:30.514 --> 01:00:31.898
Someone made a mistake.

931
01:00:31.958 --> 01:00:33.792
That's it. We're empty, ma'am.

932
01:00:43.887 --> 01:00:45.683
Someone made a big goddam mistake!

933
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.311
Break for high orbit!

934
01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:34.915
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

935
01:01:40.129 --> 01:01:41.416
Johnny!

936
01:02:03.118 --> 01:02:05.912
Rockets up!
Rocket crew, move up!

937
01:02:29.861 --> 01:02:32.825
Nuke them! Levy!
Rico! Heat them up!

938
01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:39.517
Set. Fire!

939
01:02:41.169 --> 01:02:42.295
Down!

940
01:02:47.135 --> 01:02:49.389
Follow me! Let's go!

941
01:02:52.475 --> 01:02:55.281
First platoon, left flank!

942
01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:56.607
Split up!

943
01:02:57.032 --> 01:02:59.359
First and second squads, follow me.

944
01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:02.072
Two, cover! One, with me!

945
01:03:03.533 --> 01:03:05.449
Along side! Side to side!

946
01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.330
Fire!

947
01:03:26.728 --> 01:03:28.166
Here they come!

948
01:03:31.903 --> 01:03:33.273
Ace, what are we doing?

949
01:03:33.998 --> 01:03:35.128
I don't know.

950
01:03:39.729 --> 01:03:40.807
I don't know.

951
01:03:41.832 --> 01:03:43.500
Kill them! Kill them all!

952
01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:51.878
Come on!

953
01:03:54.307 --> 01:03:57.227
Come on! Come on!
You want some?

954
01:03:58.145 --> 01:04:00.232
Here's some! Yeah!

955
01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:01.692
Here's some of this!

956
01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:07.241
Oh, my God!

957
01:04:07.424 --> 01:04:08.901
Shujimi!

958
01:04:09.826 --> 01:04:11.871
No, no, no!

959
01:04:14.124 --> 01:04:15.836
Help! Help! Help!

960
01:04:18.298 --> 01:04:19.258
No!

961
01:04:19.783 --> 01:04:20.716
God!

962
01:04:25.972 --> 01:04:27.299
Let's get out of here!

963
01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:32.466
Fall back!

964
01:04:58.215 --> 01:04:59.334
<i>Mayday!</i>

965
01:04:59.517 --> 01:05:01.602
<i>All units, fall back to retrieval.</i>
What's going on?

966
01:05:01.686 --> 01:05:03.106
<i>Repeat. All units...</i>
You got com?

967
01:05:03.189 --> 01:05:04.900
<i>Fall back to retrieval.</i>
It's a general retreat!

968
01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.152
Back to the boats!
Come on!

969
01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:08.529
Come on, let's go!

970
01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.119
We've just landed here on what cap troopers...

971
01:05:12.202 --> 01:05:14.287
are calling Big K...

972
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.874
with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division.

973
01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:19.962
It's an ugly planet, a bug planet.

974
01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:22.090
A planet hostile to life as we...

975
01:05:27.636 --> 01:05:29.140
Help me!

976
01:05:33.313 --> 01:05:34.647
Squad right!

977
01:05:46.663 --> 01:05:48.516
Come on! Go, go, go!

978
01:05:49.501 --> 01:05:51.169
Get out of here now!

979
01:05:52.714 --> 01:05:54.925
Watch your step!
Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

980
01:05:55.009 --> 01:05:56.801
<i>GXR, we're being overrun.</i>

981
01:06:06.773 --> 01:06:08.985
Kitten, no!

982
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.527
Oh, God!

983
01:06:41.652 --> 01:06:42.698
Oh, God!

984
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:16.698
<i>Crisis for humankind.</i>

985
01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:19.119
<i>Fleet officials admit they underestimated...</i>

986
01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:22.622
<i>the Arachnids' defensive capability.</i>

987
01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.251
<i>Accepting responsibility for Klendathu,</i>

988
01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:27.962
<i>Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.</i>

989
01:07:28.046 --> 01:07:30.592
<i>His successor, Sky Marshal Tahat Meru,</i>

990
01:07:30.717 --> 01:07:33.004
<i>outlines her new strategy.</i>

991
01:07:33.388 --> 01:07:35.306
<i>To fight the bug,</i>

992
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:37.810
<i>we must understand the bug.</i>

993
01:07:37.893 --> 01:07:41.022
<i>We can ill afford another Klendathu.</i>

994
01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:45.611
<i>Federal scientists struggle to explain,</i>

995
01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:48.575
<i>the intelligent military actions of the Arachnids.</i>

996
01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:50.700
<i>When a colony reaches a certain size,</i>

997
01:07:50.784 --> 01:07:53.498
<i>300 generations or something, it gets smarter.</i>

998
01:07:53.581 --> 01:07:54.957
<i>Insects with intelligence?</i>

999
01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:56.792
<i>Have you ever met one?
I can't believe,</i>

1000
01:07:56.876 --> 01:07:58.795
<i>I am hearing this nonsense.
Would you just wait a moment?</i>

1001
01:07:58.879 --> 01:08:01.842
<i>This is the most ridiculous conversation
I have ever had. Maybe-Maybe,</i>

1002
01:08:01.925 --> 01:08:05.639
<i>there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet.</i>

1003
01:08:05.722 --> 01:08:08.100
<i>a leadership caste, a hive brain.</i>

1004
01:08:08.224 --> 01:08:12.898
<i>Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find
the idea of a bug that thinks offensive!</i>

1005
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:30.588
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

1006
01:08:30.672 --> 01:08:32.506
<i>Affirmative, Rodger Young.</i>

1007
01:08:32.589 --> 01:08:35.385
<i>One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.</i>

1008
01:08:35.469 --> 01:08:36.635
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1009
01:08:38.932 --> 01:08:40.267
My God.

1010
01:08:42.186 --> 01:08:43.972
How could this happen?

1011
01:08:44.357 --> 01:08:46.733
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.

1012
01:09:04.048 --> 01:09:05.726
Give me something, please!

1013
01:09:07.053 --> 01:09:08.387
It hurts!

1014
01:09:13.728 --> 01:09:15.103
Be right with you.

1015
01:09:17.608 --> 01:09:18.743
Help me.

1016
01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:28.498
It's strange.
There's almost no wounded at all.

1017
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.626
Bugs don't take prisoners.

1018
01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.097
Oh, no.

1019
01:09:42.558 --> 01:09:43.692
Look.

1020
01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:49.567
Carmen,

1021
01:10:12.262 --> 01:10:14.117
There he is.

1022
01:10:15.142 --> 01:10:16.323
Hey, Johnny! Hey!

1023
01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:20.840
Hey, Rico!

1024
01:10:20.865 --> 01:10:22.568
Hey, Johnny!

1025
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:24.530
Hey, Rico! Wake up!
How you doing, fish boy?

1026
01:10:24.614 --> 01:10:26.898
Hey, look.
You're dead!

1027
01:10:27.283 --> 01:10:29.379
Killed in action!

1028
01:10:31.998 --> 01:10:33.834
Three more days.
Three days.

1029
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.920
And you're out. Good as new.
See you later.

1030
01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.279
Bye.

1031
01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:08.136
So what do you hear about our new unit?

1032
01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.841
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

1033
01:11:10.924 --> 01:11:13.761
Yeah, well, I hear their lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.

1034
01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.234
Who's top kick?

1035
01:11:20.938 --> 01:11:22.205
You want the job, huh?

1036
01:11:22.688 --> 01:11:24.023
I wouldn't mind.

1037
01:11:24.108 --> 01:11:25.685
I would.

1038
01:11:27.445 --> 01:11:28.782
Just doing my part.

1039
01:11:28.865 --> 01:11:30.124
Orders.

1040
01:11:32.952 --> 01:11:34.070
Yours?

1041
01:11:34.454 --> 01:11:36.107
Where you been besides Big K?

1042
01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:38.025
Outer rings, Zegema Beach.

1043
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.153
Zegema Beach?

1044
01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.834
I always wanted to go there.
Good luck.

1045
01:11:42.717 --> 01:11:44.314
It's not there any more.

1046
01:11:44.338 --> 01:11:47.531
So, I hear your lieutenant's
a real nutbuster.

1047
01:11:50.892 --> 01:11:53.246
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

1048
01:11:53.729 --> 01:11:56.193
He saved my life.
Mine too.

1049
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:59.345
Same for me.
Me too.

1050
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.962
Well, sounds like he's quite a guy.

1051
01:12:04.245 --> 01:12:05.912
Who do you think saved your ass?

1052
01:12:07.082 --> 01:12:08.156
Stand by.

1053
01:12:08.481 --> 01:12:10.068
Attention on deck!

1054
01:12:22.978 --> 01:12:24.922
This is for you new people.

1055
01:12:25.105 --> 01:12:27.148
I only have one rule

1056
01:12:27.231 --> 01:12:29.613
Everyone fights. No one quits.

1057
01:12:30.696 --> 01:12:32.899
You don't do your job, I'll shoot you.

1058
01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.033
Do you get me?

1059
01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.979
We get you, sir!

1060
01:12:38.832 --> 01:12:41.209
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rasczak's Roughnecks!

1061
01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:44.089
At ease. Listen up.

1062
01:12:44.672 --> 01:12:47.660
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.

1063
01:12:48.343 --> 01:12:50.764
We're gonna clean out the systems
outlying Klendathu,

1064
01:12:50.847 --> 01:12:53.018
one planet at a time.

1065
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:55.269
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

1066
01:12:55.353 --> 01:12:57.242
After Fleet glasses the planet,

1067
01:12:57.266 --> 01:12:58.801
MI mops up.

1068
01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:01.112
Carry on.

1069
01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:53.671
All right. Spread out!

1070
01:13:53.954 --> 01:13:54.972
Fire teams!

1071
01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:57.451
You locate a bug hole, nuke it.

1072
01:14:05.614 --> 01:14:07.490
Watkins, shake out Flores and Rico.

1073
01:14:07.574 --> 01:14:08.969
Copy that. Move out!

1074
01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:11.829
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.

1075
01:14:12.613 --> 01:14:14.560
Levy, you're with me.
No, I'm in A Squad.

1076
01:14:14.585 --> 01:14:15.558
I'm going with Rico.

1077
01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:17.120
Shut up and follow me!

1078
01:14:55.586 --> 01:14:57.381
Hey, you like that?

1079
01:14:57.465 --> 01:14:59.468
Fungus-sucking sack of maggot puke!

1080
01:14:59.593 --> 01:15:01.137
It's dead, Watkins! It's dead!

1081
01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:08.547
Ain't much to look at after you scrape
them off your boot.

1082
01:15:10.064 --> 01:15:11.337
Bug hole.

1083
01:15:11.562 --> 01:15:12.784
There.

1084
01:15:27.588 --> 01:15:28.756
Nuke them, Rico!

1085
01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:36.266
Fire in the hole!

1086
01:15:47.948 --> 01:15:50.327
<i>Watkins, we're under heavy attack.
Position M-4.</i>

1087
01:15:50.494 --> 01:15:51.667
<i>Get over here!</i>

1088
01:15:51.992 --> 01:15:52.927
Move!

1089
01:16:02.801 --> 01:16:04.477
You got a bug problem, ma'am?

1090
01:16:04.502 --> 01:16:05.830
Ah, stow it, trooper!

1091
01:16:27.376 --> 01:16:28.861
Tanker!

1092
01:16:29.545 --> 01:16:31.733
Oh, shit!
Come on! Move!

1093
01:16:41.353 --> 01:16:42.569
Get down!

1094
01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:52.615
Come on!

1095
01:18:00.998 --> 01:18:03.042
Stay down, sucker!

1096
01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:05.045
Gillespie. Well done!

1097
01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:06.714
Call for retrieval.

1098
01:18:06.797 --> 01:18:09.884
Medic!
Nice moves.

1099
01:18:09.968 --> 01:18:12.221
Where'd you learn
how to do that, soldier?

1100
01:18:12.306 --> 01:18:15.092
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

1101
01:18:15.475 --> 01:18:16.980
I was captain of the team.

1102
01:18:18.505 --> 01:18:19.506
Rico?

1103
01:18:19.764 --> 01:18:20.463
Sir.

1104
01:18:21.088 --> 01:18:22.359
I need a corporal.

1105
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:25.589
You're it until you're dead or till
I find somebody better.

1106
01:18:26.908 --> 01:18:28.108
Thank you, sir.

1107
01:18:28.991 --> 01:18:31.664
All right, saddle up! Show's over.
Way to go, Corporal.

1108
01:18:32.247 --> 01:18:33.937
Hey, I need a squad leader.

1109
01:18:34.362 --> 01:18:36.287
Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it.

1110
01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:38.589
I'm just here to fight.

1111
01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:41.352
What about it, Diz?

1112
01:18:42.136 --> 01:18:44.089
First sergeant, get your gear in section,

1113
01:18:44.473 --> 01:18:46.099
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

1114
01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:52.450
Catch you later.
All right.

1115
01:18:58.658 --> 01:19:00.176
Listen up!

1116
01:19:00.618 --> 01:19:03.830
I expect the best, and I give the best!

1117
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:09.089
Here's the beer!

1118
01:19:13.052 --> 01:19:15.012
Here's the entertainment!

1119
01:19:19.517 --> 01:19:21.521
Have fun! That's an order!

1120
01:19:22.606 --> 01:19:24.192
This one's for me!

1121
01:19:25.609 --> 01:19:27.197
Thank you, Lieutenant!

1122
01:19:30.909 --> 01:19:32.043
Rico!

1123
01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:35.090
You kill bugs good.

1124
01:19:35.873 --> 01:19:37.107
Thanks.

1125
01:19:39.045 --> 01:19:41.381
You knew the lieutenant before the war.

1126
01:19:41.465 --> 01:19:43.383
What was he like?

1127
01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:46.553
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

1128
01:19:46.636 --> 01:19:48.324
He always had this little smile.

1129
01:19:48.848 --> 01:19:51.028
Yeah, well, he don't smile much any more.

1130
01:19:52.311 --> 01:19:53.250
Yeah, well,

1131
01:19:53.275 --> 01:19:56.090
I guess your bottle fills up real
quick when your kids get smeared.

1132
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:58.612
Come on, Corporal.
Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

1133
01:19:58.695 --> 01:20:01.197
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

1134
01:20:01.281 --> 01:20:02.602
Do I have to pull rank?

1135
01:20:05.495 --> 01:20:07.040
Excuse me, sir.

1136
01:20:15.842 --> 01:20:17.115
Rico.

1137
01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.958
You once asked me for advice.
Want some now?

1138
01:20:21.117 --> 01:20:23.627
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

1139
01:20:26.190 --> 01:20:28.034
Never pass up a good thing.

1140
01:20:37.162 --> 01:20:39.833
Watkins. Beer?

1141
01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:53.250
Ace.

1142
01:21:02.361 --> 01:21:05.047
So, Rico, what are you doing after the dance?

1143
01:21:52.637 --> 01:21:53.973
What's so funny?

1144
01:21:55.515 --> 01:21:57.485
You know, just the way things work out.

1145
01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:17.113
We finally got together, Diz.

1146
01:22:20.883 --> 01:22:22.386
I love you, Johnny.

1147
01:22:33.023 --> 01:22:34.134
Rico!

1148
01:22:37.027 --> 01:22:39.823
We're moving out. There's been a distress call
from General Owen on Planet P.

1149
01:22:39.908 --> 01:22:42.076
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

1150
01:22:42.202 --> 01:22:43.421
Yes, sir.

1151
01:22:43.663 --> 01:22:45.165
Who's that with you?

1152
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:49.938
Flores, sir.

1153
01:22:52.005 --> 01:22:53.493
Make it 20 minutes.

1154
01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:55.345
Yes, sir.

1155
01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:57.732
Twenty minutes?

1156
01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:00.436
We can do it.

1157
01:23:38.819 --> 01:23:40.488
Whiskey Outpost, do you copy?

1158
01:23:40.572 --> 01:23:43.616
This is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three.
Come in, please.

1159
01:23:44.911 --> 01:23:46.329
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost,

1160
01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:48.663
this is Roughneck 2-0 on tac three.

1161
01:23:48.747 --> 01:23:51.001
Any contact with General Owen?
No, sir.

1162
01:23:51.084 --> 01:23:52.503
Not even the transponder signal.

1163
01:23:52.587 --> 01:23:55.007
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

1164
01:24:01.974 --> 01:24:03.850
Whiskey Outpost, Whiskey Outpost,

1165
01:24:03.934 --> 01:24:05.770
this is Roughneck 2-0 on,

1166
01:24:09.109 --> 01:24:10.360
Look out!

1167
01:24:17.911 --> 01:24:19.397
Sugar, your weapon.

1168
01:24:26.297 --> 01:24:28.509
Help me! Help me!

1169
01:24:38.814 --> 01:24:41.901
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

1170
01:24:43.781 --> 01:24:45.330
Rico.
Sir.

1171
01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:47.617
You're acting sergeant.
Move them out.

1172
01:24:48.996 --> 01:24:51.572
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!

1173
01:25:43.692 --> 01:25:46.171
Jeez, someone really humped the bunk.

1174
01:25:47.154 --> 01:25:48.805
Watkins.
Sir.

1175
01:25:49.489 --> 01:25:51.786
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

1176
01:25:51.869 --> 01:25:52.662
Yes, sir.

1177
01:25:52.987 --> 01:25:55.165
Give me three up on the tower, now!

1178
01:25:55.324 --> 01:25:57.184
OP there! OP there!

1179
01:25:57.267 --> 01:25:59.839
Number Two, police up these bodies!

1180
01:25:59.922 --> 01:26:01.083
Stinks in there.

1181
01:26:01.967 --> 01:26:02.670
Rico!

1182
01:26:03.595 --> 01:26:04.242
Yes, sir.

1183
01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:05.788
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.

1184
01:26:05.971 --> 01:26:08.224
Get somebody in the communications
tent and get me an uplink.

1185
01:26:08.308 --> 01:26:10.183
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.

1186
01:26:10.267 --> 01:26:11.586
Roger.
Command group with me.

1187
01:26:16.319 --> 01:26:17.568
Ah, shit.

1188
01:26:17.652 --> 01:26:19.072
Lieutenant!

1189
01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:24.403
Dirty bugs came in right while
they were having chow.

1190
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.557
Yeah, this is where they got in.

1191
01:26:34.843 --> 01:26:36.395
Lieutenant.

1192
01:26:37.178 --> 01:26:39.089
I think you're gonna want to see this.

1193
01:26:39.973 --> 01:26:41.559
What do you got, Flores?

1194
01:26:41.643 --> 01:26:43.479
God, I hate this place.

1195
01:26:58.456 --> 01:27:00.959
What does that look like to you, Rico?

1196
01:27:03.671 --> 01:27:05.508
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.

1197
01:27:15.353 --> 01:27:17.941
They sucked his brains out.

1198
01:27:27.112 --> 01:27:28.404
Open that.

1199
01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:34.045
Officer on the deck!

1200
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:36.631
Pick up the general.
Gone?

1201
01:27:36.756 --> 01:27:38.257
Is it safe?
We've got to get out of here!

1202
01:27:38.326 --> 01:27:39.385
General!
We've gotta...

1203
01:27:39.409 --> 01:27:40.362
Sir!

1204
01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.062
Thank God for you,

1205
01:27:46.087 --> 01:27:47.321
all of you.

1206
01:27:47.681 --> 01:27:49.204
You're all gonna be heroes.

1207
01:27:49.429 --> 01:27:50.959
Every last one of you.

1208
01:27:51.018 --> 01:27:52.821
Close that hole.
Yes, sir.

1209
01:27:53.646 --> 01:27:56.774
I had to evade capture.
The security of the Federation was at stake.

1210
01:27:56.858 --> 01:27:58.193
Fire in the hole!

1211
01:28:00.739 --> 01:28:03.450
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

1212
01:28:03.575 --> 01:28:05.953
Flores, I need that uplink.
Working on it, sir.

1213
01:28:06.037 --> 01:28:07.081
Damn it.

1214
01:28:07.105 --> 01:28:08.105
See?

1215
01:28:08.122 --> 01:28:09.793
They get in your mind.

1216
01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:11.402
Look, they did it to Farley.

1217
01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:13.131
They got in his mind.

1218
01:28:13.756 --> 01:28:14.971
They make you do things.

1219
01:28:15.196 --> 01:28:17.068
They made Farley call headquarters.

1220
01:28:17.228 --> 01:28:18.638
The distress call was a trap.

1221
01:28:18.721 --> 01:28:19.919
They're just like us.

1222
01:28:20.344 --> 01:28:22.343
They want to know
what makes us tick.

1223
01:28:22.485 --> 01:28:24.246
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.

1224
01:28:24.271 --> 01:28:26.147
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.

1225
01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:28.567
I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
Where's the retrieval boat?

1226
01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:31.572
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1227
01:28:31.614 --> 01:28:33.091
Oh, God!

1228
01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:36.493
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?

1229
01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:37.914
We're all gonna die!

1230
01:28:39.497 --> 01:28:40.917
Second squad, follow me!

1231
01:28:41.501 --> 01:28:43.140
Control yourself, General.

1232
01:28:43.365 --> 01:28:44.187
I can't.

1233
01:28:44.345 --> 01:28:45.390
I can't.

1234
01:28:45.673 --> 01:28:47.342
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1235
01:28:49.678 --> 01:28:50.533
Lieutenant!

1236
01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.923
He's just a little out of his mind, sir.

1237
01:28:54.351 --> 01:28:56.272
Bugs! Bugs!

1238
01:28:56.355 --> 01:28:57.907
Die!
All right.

1239
01:28:58.732 --> 01:28:59.885
Warm it all up!

1240
01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:01.776
Everything you've got!

1241
01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:03.480
Move!
Come on, you apes!

1242
01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:05.451
You want to live forever?

1243
01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.121
Here! I got bugs!

1244
01:29:39.577 --> 01:29:40.871
Fire at will!

1245
01:30:21.341 --> 01:30:22.718
Incoming!

1246
01:30:40.574 --> 01:30:41.786
Down!

1247
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.749
No! Hey!

1248
01:30:51.757 --> 01:30:53.817
Watch your fire!
Watch casualties!

1249
01:30:54.801 --> 01:30:56.971
Rico, where's my communication?

1250
01:30:57.054 --> 01:30:59.141
Diz, status on the uplink!
<i>Give me a minute.</i>

1251
01:30:59.225 --> 01:31:00.702
We don't have a minute!

1252
01:31:10.406 --> 01:31:12.492
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.
We are under...

1253
01:31:12.575 --> 01:31:13.756
<i>This is Rodger Young.
Go ahead.</i>

1254
01:31:13.781 --> 01:31:15.686
We are under attack, sir.
We need retrieval now!

1255
01:31:15.745 --> 01:31:17.208
<i>We have Planet Pas clear.</i>

1256
01:31:17.291 --> 01:31:19.336
This place crawls, sir.
We need pick-up now!

1257
01:31:19.461 --> 01:31:21.671
<i>What's your position?</i>
Come down on this transmission.

1258
01:31:21.754 --> 01:31:23.339
<i>Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!</i>

1259
01:31:23.464 --> 01:31:25.342
Well, I hope you have a crazy pilot.
Out!

1260
01:31:57.926 --> 01:31:59.012
Lieutenant!

1261
01:31:59.596 --> 01:32:01.082
Boat coming down, sir!

1262
01:32:01.264 --> 01:32:04.470
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!

1263
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:32.139
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!

1264
01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:44.154
Running low!

1265
01:32:45.448 --> 01:32:46.709
I'm out!

1266
01:32:47.034 --> 01:32:48.744
Here! Make them count!

1267
01:33:08.687 --> 01:33:10.606
Make cover fire! Fall back!

1268
01:33:26.751 --> 01:33:28.504
Move, move, move!

1269
01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:33.185
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!

1270
01:33:47.153 --> 01:33:48.456
Oh, my God!

1271
01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:55.416
Get him outta there!
Pull! Come on!

1272
01:34:01.589 --> 01:34:02.556
Rico!

1273
01:34:03.281 --> 01:34:04.287
Rico!

1274
01:34:05.095 --> 01:34:06.621
You know what to do!

1275
01:34:07.146 --> 01:34:08.214
Yes, sir!

1276
01:34:13.104 --> 01:34:14.733
Do it, Rico!

1277
01:34:40.015 --> 01:34:42.559
Yeah! Dizzy!

1278
01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:06.174
No!

1279
01:35:06.299 --> 01:35:07.534
Ace, help me!

1280
01:35:07.759 --> 01:35:09.279
Hold her down!

1281
01:35:14.019 --> 01:35:15.888
Move!
Get her into the boat!

1282
01:35:17.815 --> 01:35:19.608
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!

1283
01:35:19.693 --> 01:35:21.173
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!

1284
01:35:27.370 --> 01:35:29.080
Let's go! Get aboard!

1285
01:35:30.749 --> 01:35:32.584
Tower, let's go!

1286
01:35:38.716 --> 01:35:40.558
Let's move it, tower!

1287
01:35:41.683 --> 01:35:42.663
Run!

1288
01:35:48.688 --> 01:35:50.007
Lift off!

1289
01:36:20.731 --> 01:36:22.948
Johnny, I'm dying, dying.

1290
01:36:24.073 --> 01:36:25.178
No.

1291
01:36:25.237 --> 01:36:26.808
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

1292
01:36:27.449 --> 01:36:29.161
It's all right,

1293
01:36:30.745 --> 01:36:33.007
because I got to have you.

1294
01:36:40.675 --> 01:36:42.317
Johnny, don't let me go!

1295
01:36:42.801 --> 01:36:44.254
Joh, Joh...

1296
01:37:05.039 --> 01:37:09.087
<i>This is traffic control.
Proceed on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.</i>

1297
01:37:11.214 --> 01:37:12.926
I think you should know,

1298
01:37:14.177 --> 01:37:16.473
your friend Rico is back there.

1299
01:37:25.733 --> 01:37:29.487
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.

1300
01:37:29.572 --> 01:37:31.284
On whose authority, Corporal?

1301
01:37:31.367 --> 01:37:34.452
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

1302
01:37:35.872 --> 01:37:38.334
Rodger Young, we have an official request,

1303
01:37:38.459 --> 01:37:41.545
by the Mobile Infantry to commence
bombardment of Planet P.

1304
01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.103
I thought you were dead.

1305
01:37:45.428 --> 01:37:48.114
I'm not, but a lot of my troopers are.

1306
01:37:48.597 --> 01:37:50.557
<i>Negative on your request, DeRuyter.</i>

1307
01:37:50.641 --> 01:37:52.411
<i>The Sky Marshal has other plans for Planet P.</i>

1308
01:37:52.894 --> 01:37:54.146
<i>Welcome back.</i>

1309
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:57.318
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.

1310
01:37:57.443 --> 01:37:59.221
Hold on. Something's up.

1311
01:37:59.447 --> 01:38:01.706
Fleet's mobilized for a big operation.

1312
01:38:30.945 --> 01:38:32.622
Attention on deck!

1313
01:38:39.874 --> 01:38:41.793
Once somebody asked me,

1314
01:38:41.876 --> 01:38:44.037
if I knew the difference between a citizen,

1315
01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:45.739
and a civilian.

1316
01:38:46.422 --> 01:38:47.967
I can tell you now.

1317
01:38:48.051 --> 01:38:50.135
A citizen has the courage,

1318
01:38:50.218 --> 01:38:54.025
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

1319
01:38:58.942 --> 01:39:01.119
Dizzy was my friend.

1320
01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:03.130
She was a soldier.

1321
01:39:03.655 --> 01:39:04.889
But more than that,

1322
01:39:05.573 --> 01:39:07.995
she was a citizen of the Federation.

1323
01:39:10.415 --> 01:39:12.332
Present arms!

1324
01:39:30.858 --> 01:39:33.152
Order arms!

1325
01:39:37.032 --> 01:39:38.785
Left face!

1326
01:39:52.929 --> 01:39:54.771
Officer on deck!
Carry on.

1327
01:39:56.598 --> 01:39:58.869
Burial detail, dismissed.

1328
01:40:06.179 --> 01:40:07.489
At ease.

1329
01:40:08.572 --> 01:40:10.770
How are you, Carl?
Carmen, good.

1330
01:40:11.954 --> 01:40:14.832
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.

1331
01:40:14.956 --> 01:40:17.077
That mission had
a very low survival probability.

1332
01:40:17.459 --> 01:40:19.505
The bugs laid a trap for us, didn't they?

1333
01:40:20.924 --> 01:40:23.042
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it?

1334
01:40:23.467 --> 01:40:25.488
We thought there might be a Brain Bug on P.

1335
01:40:25.971 --> 01:40:27.891
You knew, and you sent them anyway?

1336
01:40:27.974 --> 01:40:31.395
We couldn't afford to launch an operation
if there wasn't one.

1337
01:40:33.314 --> 01:40:36.692
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.

1338
01:40:36.776 --> 01:40:38.696
We're in this for the species, boys and girls.

1339
01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:41.157
It's simple numbers.
They have more.

1340
01:40:41.181 --> 01:40:42.995
And every day I have to make decisions,

1341
01:40:43.078 --> 01:40:45.914
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.

1342
01:40:45.997 --> 01:40:47.576
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

1343
01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:50.695
That's what the Mobile Infantry is good for.

1344
01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.417
I hope you're ready for more.

1345
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:57.055
We're going back to P to capture that Brain.

1346
01:40:59.139 --> 01:41:00.694
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.

1347
01:41:01.977 --> 01:41:04.564
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

1348
01:41:04.648 --> 01:41:08.651
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.

1349
01:41:10.865 --> 01:41:13.777
<i>Attention.
All personnel report to your stations.</i>

1350
01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:14.661
Well...

1351
01:41:14.686 --> 01:41:17.264
<i>Prepare for drop in 75 minutes.</i>

1352
01:41:17.623 --> 01:41:19.458
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

1353
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:21.037
I'll see you again.

1354
01:41:34.519 --> 01:41:36.147
Officer on deck!

1355
01:41:53.588 --> 01:41:56.375
Who are all these kids?
We got reinforced.

1356
01:41:57.258 --> 01:41:59.270
Most of them are fresh out of boot.

1357
01:41:59.553 --> 01:42:01.389
We're the old men, Ace.

1358
01:42:03.767 --> 01:42:05.662
This is for all you new people.

1359
01:42:06.146 --> 01:42:08.057
I only have one rule.

1360
01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.527
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1361
01:42:11.568 --> 01:42:14.699
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

1362
01:42:14.741 --> 01:42:16.074
Do you get me?

1363
01:42:16.199 --> 01:42:17.843
We get you, sir!

1364
01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:22.958
Welcome to the Roughnecks.
Rico's Roughnecks!

1365
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:27.575
Today we're gonna pay a visit to Bug City.

1366
01:42:28.258 --> 01:42:30.595
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.

1367
01:42:31.079 --> 01:42:32.815
Some kind of smart bug.

1368
01:42:39.397 --> 01:42:41.359
And it probably knows we're coming.

1369
01:42:41.442 --> 01:42:42.494
Saddle up!

1370
01:42:42.919 --> 01:42:44.586
Saddle up now!

1371
01:42:45.446 --> 01:42:47.324
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

1372
01:42:58.796 --> 01:43:00.758
Evasive action.

1373
01:43:24.123 --> 01:43:25.659
Get us clear for warp, Number Two.

1374
01:43:26.001 --> 01:43:28.461
Clear in five, four,

1375
01:43:28.545 --> 01:43:30.505
Initiating star drive, three, in five.

1376
01:43:54.664 --> 01:43:57.125
This is Rodger Young.
We're going down Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

1377
01:43:57.209 --> 01:44:00.588
Get out! We're going down.
Abandon ship! Come on!

1378
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:03.233
Carmen!

1379
01:44:04.175 --> 01:44:06.229
Zander!
Here!

1380
01:44:07.012 --> 01:44:09.541
We've got to get to the rescue deck!
Come on!

1381
01:44:26.747 --> 01:44:27.941
Captain!

1382
01:44:31.043 --> 01:44:33.965
Abandon ship.
That's an...

1383
01:44:35.382 --> 01:44:37.870
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!

1384
01:44:55.369 --> 01:44:57.806
Go! Here!

1385
01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:14.777
Follow me!

1386
01:45:26.744 --> 01:45:27.810
Ready?

1387
01:45:34.337 --> 01:45:35.754
Hit it!

1388
01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.656
Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1389
01:46:03.291 --> 01:46:05.038
Scanning for a landing zone!

1390
01:46:05.663 --> 01:46:07.447
Checking terrain. Here!

1391
01:46:08.548 --> 01:46:10.633
Can you handle that?
Piece of cake.

1392
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:16.935
<i>We've lost the Rodger Young!
What is your position?</i>

1393
01:46:17.018 --> 01:46:20.446
<i>Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.</i>

1394
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:22.441
Oh. Johnny!
<i>This is Flight Command.</i>

1395
01:46:24.736 --> 01:46:25.781
Johnny!

1396
01:46:28.366 --> 01:46:29.930
Rodger Young just burned up.

1397
01:46:30.755 --> 01:46:32.050
It's on the rescue net.

1398
01:46:34.815 --> 01:46:36.194
Any survivors?

1399
01:46:36.919 --> 01:46:39.204
Well, they're getting tarred up
there pretty bad.

1400
01:46:39.588 --> 01:46:41.007
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1401
01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:42.536
Is anyone receiving?

1402
01:46:42.719 --> 01:46:44.036
<i>Is anyone receiving?</i>
Affirmative.

1403
01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.679
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1404
01:46:45.763 --> 01:46:47.349
You're breaking up.
Say again.

1405
01:46:47.533 --> 01:46:48.694
Carmen?

1406
01:46:49.619 --> 01:46:50.754
Carmen?

1407
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:56.528
Prepare for landing.

1408
01:46:56.611 --> 01:46:58.447
Retros in three,

1409
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:00.392
two, one, fire!

1410
01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:18.890
Carmen. Carmen.

1411
01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:20.602
Hey, are you okay?

1412
01:47:21.184 --> 01:47:22.603
Get out. Get out.

1413
01:47:32.283 --> 01:47:34.376
<i>This is Roughneck 2-0.
Are you receiving? Over.</i>

1414
01:47:35.101 --> 01:47:36.214
<i>This is Roughneck 2-0.</i>

1415
01:47:36.297 --> 01:47:37.750
<i>Carmen, are you receiving?</i>

1416
01:47:38.375 --> 01:47:39.542
Johnny, is that you?

1417
01:47:39.566 --> 01:47:40.577
Yes It's me!

1418
01:47:40.678 --> 01:47:42.237
What's your position and situation?

1419
01:47:42.796 --> 01:47:44.947
We're in Bug City, 20 metres
underground, position:

1420
01:47:45.972 --> 01:47:48.789
South 42, East 118, situation is.

1421
01:47:49.973 --> 01:47:51.769
<i>I repeat. South 42, East 118.</i>

1422
01:47:51.852 --> 01:47:54.012
<i>What's your situation?
Over.</i>

1423
01:47:54.395 --> 01:47:55.474
<i>Carmen.</i>

1424
01:47:57.983 --> 01:47:59.903
Situation is extremely hostile.

1425
01:48:04.867 --> 01:48:06.828
I need a squad to pull them out!

1426
01:48:06.912 --> 01:48:09.082
Direction?
Three clicks, south by south-west.

1427
01:48:15.548 --> 01:48:17.260
Look out!

1428
01:48:35.943 --> 01:48:37.320
What do you wanna do?

1429
01:48:37.345 --> 01:48:38.729
You heard the lieutenant.

1430
01:48:39.288 --> 01:48:40.663
Rescue party!

1431
01:48:40.688 --> 01:48:42.826
Third squad, come with me!

1432
01:48:43.051 --> 01:48:44.173
Cancel that!

1433
01:48:45.556 --> 01:48:47.709
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.

1434
01:48:51.689 --> 01:48:53.023
Sorry, buddy.

1435
01:48:55.025 --> 01:48:56.262
Roughnecks,

1436
01:48:56.887 --> 01:48:58.380
let's move.

1437
01:48:58.740 --> 01:48:59.883
All right.

1438
01:49:15.594 --> 01:49:17.171
Why didn't they kill us?

1439
01:49:17.555 --> 01:49:19.666
They want us alive.

1440
01:50:13.756 --> 01:50:15.450
We should go this way.

1441
01:50:17.385 --> 01:50:19.145
A Company's that way.

1442
01:50:19.929 --> 01:50:23.085
Yeah, but Carmen's down there.

1443
01:50:24.269 --> 01:50:27.665
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.

1444
01:50:29.108 --> 01:50:30.359
She's still alive.

1445
01:50:30.442 --> 01:50:32.056
How do you know?

1446
01:50:32.738 --> 01:50:34.649
I don't know how I know, but I know.
Listen.

1447
01:50:35.574 --> 01:50:37.952
You got command,
but going off mission,

1448
01:50:38.035 --> 01:50:40.255
That's a serious offence.
Yeah.

1449
01:50:40.539 --> 01:50:42.300
I think they hang you for that.

1450
01:50:44.711 --> 01:50:46.292
Roughneck 2-0,

1451
01:50:46.617 --> 01:50:48.574
proceed on mission.

1452
01:50:48.634 --> 01:50:50.522
I need two volunteers.

1453
01:52:01.456 --> 01:52:02.716
One day,

1454
01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:05.218
someone like me,

1455
01:52:05.301 --> 01:52:07.098
is gonna kill you,

1456
01:52:07.581 --> 01:52:09.709
and your whole fucking race.

1457
01:53:09.287 --> 01:53:10.411
You know what this is?

1458
01:53:13.459 --> 01:53:14.750
Sure you do.

1459
01:53:16.379 --> 01:53:18.924
You're some kind of big, fat, smart bug,

1460
01:53:19.007 --> 01:53:20.384
aren't you?

1461
01:53:22.596 --> 01:53:23.654
Come on.

1462
01:53:35.986 --> 01:53:37.581
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1463
01:53:37.865 --> 01:53:40.995
Brain Bug sighted moving west of grid five.

1464
01:53:43.748 --> 01:53:44.926
Run!

1465
01:54:15.288 --> 01:54:17.709
Go! Go!

1466
01:54:17.792 --> 01:54:21.097
Give me the nuke!
You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

1467
01:54:23.467 --> 01:54:25.705
I'm trying to kill some bugs, sir!

1468
01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:27.745
Get outta here!

1469
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:30.084
Get outta here!

1470
01:54:31.644 --> 01:54:32.836
Move!

1471
01:54:37.651 --> 01:54:40.907
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!

1472
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:42.282
You want a little more?

1473
01:54:45.746 --> 01:54:48.034
You like that? You like that?
You like that? You like that?

1474
01:54:48.059 --> 01:54:49.011
You want a little more?

1475
01:54:55.051 --> 01:54:56.219
Come on! Come on!

1476
01:55:01.559 --> 01:55:02.894
Come on, come on, come on!

1477
01:55:27.468 --> 01:55:28.677
Come on, Carmen.

1478
01:55:40.986 --> 01:55:43.489
We did it! We won!

1479
01:55:48.829 --> 01:55:50.581
What's going on?
They got it!

1480
01:55:51.164 --> 01:55:52.335
Come on!

1481
01:56:05.769 --> 01:56:09.857
Pull! Pull! Pull!

1482
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:23.834
Quiet!

1483
01:56:35.349 --> 01:56:36.901
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1484
01:56:55.668 --> 01:56:56.962
It's afraid.

1485
01:56:58.462 --> 01:56:59.714
It's afraid!

1486
01:57:03.804 --> 01:57:07.181
Come on.
Yeah!

1487
01:57:07.306 --> 01:57:09.686
Carl! Carl! Hey!

1488
01:57:09.811 --> 01:57:12.731
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

1489
01:57:12.814 --> 01:57:15.769
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

1490
01:57:16.152 --> 01:57:17.698
Well, that's classified.

1491
01:57:19.824 --> 01:57:22.579
You know, whenever the three of us are together,

1492
01:57:22.663 --> 01:57:24.640
I feel like things might just work out.

1493
01:57:25.665 --> 01:57:27.042
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1494
01:57:27.668 --> 01:57:30.548
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1495
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:32.015
And then we'll know how to beat them.

1496
01:57:33.299 --> 01:57:34.886
One day it will all be over,

1497
01:57:35.428 --> 01:57:37.391
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

1498
01:57:38.474 --> 01:57:40.235
This is when it turned.

1499
01:57:41.518 --> 01:57:44.967
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1500
01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:52.618
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

1501
01:57:52.701 --> 01:57:54.286
Come on! Who am I?

1502
01:57:54.370 --> 01:57:55.698
Yeah!
Zim?

1503
01:57:57.875 --> 01:57:59.153
He got him!
Yeah!

1504
01:58:00.136 --> 01:58:02.088
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1505
01:58:02.172 --> 01:58:03.716
Zim got the bug, man!

1506
01:58:04.341 --> 01:58:06.539
Good job, Sergeant.
Thank you, sir.

1507
01:58:07.322 --> 01:58:09.602
That would be private, sir.

1508
01:58:11.027 --> 01:58:12.285
Carry on, Private.

1509
01:58:12.486 --> 01:58:13.631
Yes, sir!

1510
01:58:19.694 --> 01:58:22.781
<i>What mysteries will the Brain Bug reveal?</i>

1511
01:58:22.864 --> 01:58:27.789
<i>Federal scientists are working around
the clock to probe its secrets.</i>

1512
01:58:27.873 --> 01:58:31.336
<i>Once we understand the bug, we will defeat it.</i>

1513
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:39.054
<i>We have the ships.</i>

1514
01:58:39.137 --> 01:58:40.431
<i>We have the weapons.</i>

1515
01:58:41.975 --> 01:58:43.334
<i>We need soldiers.</i>

1516
01:58:44.059 --> 01:58:46.212
<i>Soldiers like Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.</i>

1517
01:58:46.396 --> 01:58:47.982
<i>We're over the target area now, Captain.</i>

1518
01:58:48.565 --> 01:58:51.436
<i>And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
This is the captain speaking.</i>

1519
01:58:51.819 --> 01:58:53.488
<i>All personnel prepare for drop.</i>

1520
01:58:53.572 --> 01:58:56.226
<i>Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.</i>

1521
01:58:56.250 --> 01:58:59.072
<i>Come on, you apes! You
wanna live forever?</i>

1522
01:58:59.956 --> 01:59:01.258
<i>We need you all.</i>

1523
01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:04.363
<i>Service guarantees citizenship.</i>
