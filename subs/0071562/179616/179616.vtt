REBA: Okay, here we go.

687
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,149
So, what do you need the lR for?

688
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,918
It's for the zoo.

689
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,719
They want to photograph
the nocturnal animals.

690
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,032
That's great. I love animals.
I got to warn you, though.

691
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,711
This stuff is pretty sensitive.
It can be mean to handle.

692
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,073
But I guess
I don't need to tell you that.

693
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,150
Hey, Reba. Oh, Mr. D. Whoa!

694
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:17,195
I'm not interrupting anything,
am l?

695
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,395
No, Ralph.

696
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,756
It's starting to spritz outside.

697
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,829
I'll give you a lift home?

698
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,478
You ride a motorcycle.

699
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,676
How's that gonna help me
with the rain?

700
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,320
I thought maybe
we'd stop off someplace...

701
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,351
have ourselves
a little sundowner.

702
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,159
-I've already got a ride.
-It's cool.

703
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,916
That's cool. No problemo.

704
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,309
If there's anything I hate worse
than pity, it's fake pity.

705
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,676
Especially from a walking
hard-on like Ralph Mandy.

706
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,752
-Sorry.
-I have no pity.

707
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,073
Ride with me!

708
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,673
Thanks, but I take the bus
all the time.

709
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,552
Mandy is a fool. Ride with me...

710
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,592
for my pleasure.

711
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,753
You want to come in?
I'll fix us a drink.

712
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,077
-Maybe another time.
-I will come in.

713
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,956
When is the zoo project?

714
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,434
-Maybe next week. They'll call.
-I love zoos.

715
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,312
In fact one of my earliest
memories is seeing a cougar...

716
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,717
when I was about five.

717
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,758
I didn't lose my sight
till I was seven. Diphtheria.

718
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,035
Could you hand me that knife?

719
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,478
I've always tried to hang on
to what that cougar looked like.

720
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,194
But by now, to tell the truth,
what I see in my head...

721
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,356
is probably not in the least bit
like a cougar.

722
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,476
It's more like
a donkey or a goat.

723
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,239
You know, sometimes I'm not
so sure I really saw him.

724
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,033
Maybe he's just
something I dreamed up.

725
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,434
You okay?

726
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,750
You don't say much, do you?

727
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,792
No, I guess not.

728
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,031
Let's talk about something
and get it out of the way, okay?

729
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,670
I can hear that you've had...

730
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,995
some kind of soft palate repair.

731
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,510
But I understand you fine
because you speak very well.

732
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,517
If you don't want to talk to me,
that's cool.

733
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,034
But I hope that you will,
because...

734
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,276
I know what it's like
to have people...

735
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,914
always thinking
that you're different.

736
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,759
That's good.

737
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,437
May I touch your face?

738
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,558
I want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

739
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,956
I want to know whether I should
just shut up or not.

740
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,350
Take my word that I'm smiling.

741
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,793
I have to go.

742
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,916
If I offended you,
I didn't mean to.

743
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,150
No.

748

I sure do. I mean, other than...

749
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,154
one or two little keepsakes
Niles Jacobi got.

750
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,637
That would be Mr. Jacobi's
surviving son by his first wife?

751
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,957
Yes. As their executor, I keep
all that stuff in the office...

along with some of the smaller
valuables, till after probate.

been all through it.

Could you pack those things
and ship them up to me?

Hey, thanks, Mr. Metcalf.

by the Tooth Fairy.

He's asking questions.

we have the note?

a routine cleanup.

CRAWFORD: No. But he's been there
almost half an hour.

773
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,713
He'll soon start to wonder
what's wrong.

I wanted to tell you...

792
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,315
I'm delighted...

793
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,356
that you've taken an interest in me.

correspondence, I thought:

"Dare I?" Of course I do.

796
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,070
I don't believe
you'll tell them who I am.

Besides, what particular body
I currently occupy is trivial.

01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,237
Baltimore postmark
on the envelope.

855
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,117
It's set to run this afternoon.

856
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,556
Chicago field office is sending
the text through now.

857
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,317
-"Dear Pilgrim."
-That's it.

858
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,596
Lecter called him a pilgrim
when we talked.

859
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,956
"You honour me.
You're very beautiful." Christ!

860
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,476
"l offer 100 prayers
for your safety.

861
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,393
"Find help in John 6:22, 8:16...

862
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,993
"9:1, Luke 1 :7 "

863
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,758
-Code.
-Has to be.

864
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,154
We've got 19 minutes to get in
a message if we can break this.

865
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,475
The Tattler can't hold
its presses any longer.

866
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,470
It's simple.

867
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,074
They only needed cover
against casual readers.

868
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,918
-I'm thinking it's a book code.
-Code?

869
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,228
The first numeral...

870
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,719
"100 prayers,"
may be the page number.

871
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,559
The numbers after could be
line and letter. But what book?

872
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,790
-Bible?
-No, he's got "Galatians 15:2"

873
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,279
It has only six chapters.

874
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,436
Same with "Jonah 6:8"
It has four chapters.

875
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,953
He wasn't using a Bible.

876
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,594
Then the Tooth Fairy
named the book to use.

877
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,478
He specified it in his note,
in the part Lecter tore out.

878
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,278
BOWMAN: It would appear so.

879
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,278
What about sweating Lecter?
In a mental hospital...

880
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,793
-I would think drugs--
-No.

881
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,832
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago, to find out...

882
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,552
where he buried
the Princeton student.

883
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,517
He gave them a recipe for dip.

884
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,596
If we sweat him,
we lose the connection.

885
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,517
If the Tooth Fairy
picked the book...

886
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,915
he knew Lecter would have it
in his cell.

887
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,918
-Can we get a list of his books?
-From Chilton, maybe.

888
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,833
No! Wait! Rankin and Willingham,
when they tossed his cell...

889
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,713
took Polaroids so they could put
everything back in place.
