2
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.900
They've killed your son Paolo!

3
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.400
Murderers! Murderers!

4
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.700
My son...

5
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.500
All my respect, Don Ciccio.

6
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.700
You killed my husband because
he wouldn't give in to you.

7
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.600
And his oldest son Paolo...

8
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.900
...because he swore revenge.

9
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.700
But Vito is only nine.
And dumb-witted.

10
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.200
He never speaks.

11
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.700
It's not his words I'm afraid of.

12
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
He's weak. He couldn't hurt anyone.

13
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.600
But when he grows, he'll grow strong.

14
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.700
Don't worry. This little boy
can't do a thing to you.

15
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.600
When he's a man, he'll
come for revenge.

16
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.500
I beg you, Don Ciccio,
spare my only son.

17
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.500
He's all I have left.

18
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.900
I swear to God he'll never do
you any harm. Spare him!

19
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.100
Vito, run!

20
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.400
Move and I'll kill him!

21
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.900
Run, Vito!

22
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.800
Kill him!

23
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.700
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

24
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.300
You understand?

25
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.600
Anybody who hides the boy
Vito Andolini is in for trouble!

26
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.700
Vito, we're praying for you!

27
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.100
If anyone is hiding the boy
Vito Andolini...

28
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.000
...turn him over to us.

29
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.500
Don Ciccio will thank you for it!

30
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.800
It'll be better for the boy,
and better for you!

31
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.500
Any family who hides the boy
Vito Andolini will regret it!

32
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.600
Nurse.

33
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.300
Money?

34
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Interpreter!

35
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.300
Where are you from?

36
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.800
-What is your name?
-Maria.

37
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.300
What is your name?

38
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.700
Come on, son. What is your name?

39
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.800
Vito Andolini from Corleone.

40
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.200
Corleone. Vito Corleone.

41
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.400
Okay, over there.

42
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.500
Next.

43
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.300
Tell him he has smallpox.
Quarantine three months.

44
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.800
Vito Corleone!

45
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.700
Vito Corleone!

46
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.900
Here he is. This is him.

47
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.600
Did you bring the car keys?

48
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.400
Laurie! Laurie!

49
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.800
Mama!

50
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.600
Mama!

51
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.500
-Look who's here.
-Father Carmelo.

52
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.900
-This is Father Carmelo.
-I'm Merle Johnson.

53
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.400
Mama!

54
00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.500
-Here I am.
-Constanzia, after one week?

55
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.700
I sent the car to the airport last week
to pick you up.

56
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:10.700
It was chaos. Anyway, here I am, just
one week late. This is for my mama!

57
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.000
-What is this?
-You remember Merle?

58
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.800
Hello. How are you? Thank you.

59
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.500
Where's Michael? I've got to talk to him
and I can't wait on line.

60
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.900
You go see your children first.

61
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.700
Then you worry about waiting on line to
see your brother. Like everybody else.

62
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

63
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.400
<i>A most distinguished guest
would like to say a few words.</i>

64
00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.600
<i>Please welcome Senator Pat Geary
of the State of Nevada.</i>

65
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.400
<i>And there is Mrs. Geary.</i>

66
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.000
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

67
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:08.900
<i>This is a very, very happy day
for me and my wife Mrs. Geary.</i>

68
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.600
<i>We see Nevada far too seldom.</i>

69
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.600
<i>But today we can join with old friends,
we can make new friends</i>

70
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.700
<i>and we help celebrate
a young man's first Communion.</i>

71
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:29.200
<i>And also to thank that boy's family for
a magnificent contribution to the State.</i>

72
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.100
<i>I have here in my hand a check
made out to the university</i>

73
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.000
<i>and it is a magnificent endowment
in the name of</i>

74
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.200
<i>Anthony Vito Corleone.</i>

75
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.400
<i>The check is signed by
that young man's parents</i>

76
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.300
<i>whom I think we should recognize.</i>

77
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.800
<i>Mike, Pat, Kay, stand up, please.
Let the folks see you!</i>

78
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.000
<i>Folks, I want you to join me</i>

79
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:03.800
<i>in giving a real Nevada thank you
to Mr. and Mrs. Michael Corleone!</i>

80
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:15.000
<i>We also have, as a special added
attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir</i>

81
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.500
<i>who have chosen a certain special song
and a special arrangement</i>

82
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.600
<i>to honor their host,
Mr. Michael Corleone.</i>

83
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.300
<i>Boys.</i>

84
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.000
The plaque.

85
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.700
Okay, fellows, did you get that one?

86
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.700
Okay, that's good.

87
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.900
Now, Senator,
just you and Mrs. Corleone.

88
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.400
My lawyer Tom Hagen. Senator Geary.

89
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.600
He arranged everything
through your man Turnbull.

90
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.800
-Yes, yes.
-Sit down.

91
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.400
I thought that you and
I would talk alone.

92
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.700
I trust these men with my life, Senator.
To ask them to leave would be an insult.

93
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.800
Well, it's perfectly all right with me

94
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.500
but I am a blunt man and I intend
to speak very frankly to you.

95
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.700
Maybe more frankly

96
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.100
than anyone in my position
has ever talked to you before.

97
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.300
The Corleone family
has done well in Nevada.

98
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.600
You own, or control,
two major hotels in Vegas

99
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:07.200
and one in Reno.
The licenses were grandfathered in

100
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.700
so there was no problem
with the Gaming Commission.

101
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.700
Now my sources tell me

102
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.900
that you plan to make a move
against the Tropigala.

103
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
They tell me that within a week,
you're going to move Klingman out.

104
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.900
Quite an expansion. However, it will
leave you with a little technical problem.

105
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.300
The license will still be
in Klingman's name.

106
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.100
-Turnbull is a good man.
-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit.

107
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.400
I don't want to spend
more time here than I have to.

108
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.900
You can have the license.

109
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.900
The price is 250,000 dollars.

110
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.600
Plus five per cent of the gross monthly

111
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.200
of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone.

112
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.700
The price for the license
is less than 20,000 dollars, right?

113
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.200
That's right.

114
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.800
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.

115
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.600
I don't like your kind of people.

116
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:23.200
I don't like to see you come out
to this clean country in oily hair

117
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.600
dressed up in those silk suits

118
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.600
and try to pass yourselves off
as decent Americans.

119
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.400
I'll do business with you, but the fact is
that I despise your masquerade,

120
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:41.000
the dishonest way you pose yourself
and your whole fucking family.

121
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.300
Senator,

122
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.500
we're both part of the same hypocrisy.

123
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.500
But never think it applies to my family.

124
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.600
All right, all right.

125
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.600
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.

126
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.800
Let's say that you'll pay me
because it's in your interest.

127
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.900
I want your answer and the money
by noon tomorrow. One more thing.

128
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.600
Don't you contact me again, ever.

129
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.500
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
Open that door, son.

130
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.900
Senator, you can have my answer now
if you like.

131
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.300
My offer is this...

132
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.000
Nothing.

133
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:46.400
Not even the fee for the gaming license,
which I would like you to put up.

134
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.100
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

135
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.500
Ladies! I didn't know you were out here.

136
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.700
-Honey, we have to go.
-Really? I'm sorry.

137
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.200
-It's been delightful.
-It was our pleasure.

138
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.900
It was wonderful talking to you.

139
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.600
Fredo! Fredo, you son-of-a-bitch,
you look great!

140
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.700
Frank Pentangeli!

141
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.900
I thought you was
never coming out west, you big bum!

142
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.700
I've got to check on my boys.

143
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.800
-What's with the food here?
-What's the matter?

144
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.800
A kid gives me a Ritz cracker
with chopped liver and says, "canapés".

145
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:22.200
I said, "Can of peas, my ass. That's
a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!"

146
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.600
Bring out the peppers and sardines!

147
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.500
Seeing you reminds me of New York
in the old days!

148
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:39.200
You remember Willi Cicci, who was
with old man Clemenza in Brooklyn?

149
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.900
We were all upset about that.
Heart attack, huh?

150
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.100
No, that was no heart attack.

151
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.400
That's what I'm here to see
your brother Mike about.

152
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.500
-But what's with him?
-What do you mean?

153
00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.000
Do I have to get a letter of introduction
to get a sit-down?

154
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.700
-You can't get in to see Mike?
-He's got me waiting in a lobby!

155
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.500
-Johnny Ola.
-Al Neri.

156
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.300
-Do you know my lawyer Tom Hagen?
-I remember Tom from the old days.

157
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.000
Rocco.

158
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.100
-What's this?
-It's an orange from Miami.

159
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.200
Take care of Johnny's men.
They look like they might be hungry.

160
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.300
Johnny?

161
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.600
Tom won't stay. He only handles
specific areas of the business.

162
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.500
Sure, Mike.

163
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.800
-What are you drinking, Johnny?
-Anisette.

164
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.400
-If you need anything, I'll be outside.
-Just tell Rocco we're waiting, Tom.

165
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.800
-I just left Mr. Roth in Miami.
-How is his health?

166
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.800
It's not good.

167
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.500
Can I do anything or send anything?

168
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:21.400
He appreciates your concern, Michael,
and your respect.

169
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.400
That casino...

170
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:28.200
Registered owners. Jacob Lawrence,
Allan Barclay. Beverly Hills attorneys.

171
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.900
The real owners are
the old Lakeville Road group

172
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.200
and our friend in Miami.

173
00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:40.700
Klingman runs it and owns a piece of
it too, but I've been instructed to tell you

174
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.800
that if you move him out,
our friend in Miami will go along.

175
00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.800
It's very kind of him.
Tell him it's greatly appreciated.

176
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.800
Hyman Roth always makes money
for his partners.

177
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.000
One by one, our old friends are gone.

178
00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.800
Death, natural or not,

179
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.700
prison, deported...

180
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.200
Only Hyman Roth is left, because he
always made money for his partners.

181
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.700
I can't believe it! Out of 30 professional
musicians there isn't one Italian!

182
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.500
Let's have a tarantella!

183
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.300
You! Up, up, up!

184
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.400
<i>Questa mano!</i>

185
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.600
<i>Questa mano!</i>

186
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.400
What the hell have we here?

187
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:13.000
-I'll see my sister alone.
-It concerns me too. May I stay?

188
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.300
How are you, honey? You've met
Merle, he was with me in Vegas.

189
00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.600
-I saw him with you.
-Could I have a drink?

190
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.500
Al, please get him a drink!

191
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.600
We're going to Europe. I'd like to book
passage on The Queen.

192
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.500
Why don't you go to a travel agent?

193
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.600
We're getting married first.

194
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:51.500
The ink on your divorce isn't dry yet,
and you're getting married?

195
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.100
You see your children on weekends.

196
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.300
Your oldest boy was picked up in Reno
for a theft you don't even know about.

197
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.800
You fly around the world
with men who use you!

198
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.400
-You're not my father!
-So why come to me?

199
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.900
I need money.

200
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.100
Connie, Connie, Connie...

201
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.100
I want to be reasonable with you.

202
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.100
Why don't you stay with the family?

203
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.900
You can live on the estate
with your kids.

204
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.700
You won't be deprived of anything.

205
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.600
I don't know this Merle. I don't know
what he does or what he lives on.

206
00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.200
Tell him marriage is out of the question
and you don't want to see him anymore.

207
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.500
He'll understand, believe me.

208
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500
Connie.

209
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.200
If you don't listen to me
and marry this man,

210
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.400
you'll disappoint me.

211
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.200
<i>-Famiglia!
-Cent' anni!</i>

212
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.000
What's "Chen dannay"?

213
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.000
"Cent' anni". It means 100 years.

214
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.400
It means we should all live happily
for 100 years. The family.

215
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.500
-It would be true if my father were alive.
-Connie.

216
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.200
Hey...

217
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.100
Merle, you've met my sister-in-law,
Deanna.

218
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.900
-Fredo's wife.
-My pleasure.

219
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.400
With all respect, I didn't
come here to eat dinner!

220
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.700
I know, I know.

221
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.100
-I just want to dance!
-You're falling all over the floor.

222
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.000
You're justjealous
because he's a real man!

223
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.900
-I'm going to belt you right in the teeth.
-You couldn't belt your mama!

224
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.000
These Dagos are crazy
when it comes to their wives.

225
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.000
Michael says that if you can't
take care of this, I have to.

226
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.000
-I think you'd better.
-Never marry a Wop.

227
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.700
They treat their wives like shit!
I didn't mean to say Wop. Don't!

228
00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:50.000
What are you doing to me,
you big slob? Help!

229
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.200
Fredo!

230
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.200
-I can't control her, Mikey.
-You're my brother, don't apologize.

231
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.200
Clemenza promised the Rosato
brothers three territories after he died.

232
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.800
You took over and didn't give it to them.

233
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.100
I welched.

234
00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:11.600
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.

235
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.400
-He hated them more than I do.
-Frankie, they feel cheated.

236
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.400
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains
and you're drinking...

237
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.900
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.

238
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:30.000
Champagne cocktails, and passing
judgment on how I run my family.

239
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.000
Your family's still called Corleone.

240
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.300
And you'll run it like a Corleone.

241
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.400
My family doesn't eat here,
doesn't eat in Las Vegas...

242
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.500
...and doesn't eat in Miami...

243
00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.700
...with Hyman Roth!

244
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.600
You're a good old man and I like you.

245
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.100
You were loyal to my father for years.

246
00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.700
The Rosato brothers
are taking hostages.

247
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.800
They spit right in my face, all because
they're backed up by that Jew in Miami.

248
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.800
I know. That's why
I don't want them touched.

249
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.700
-Not touched?
-No, I want you to be fair with them.

250
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.800
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?

251
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.100
Tom, listen. They recruit spics,
they recruit niggers.

252
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.000
They do violence in their grandmothers'
neighborhoods!

253
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:41.600
And everything with them is whores!
Andjunk, dope!

254
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.300
And they leave the gambling to last.

255
00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.700
I want to run my family without you
on my back. I want those Rosatos dead!

256
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.600
<i>-No.
-Morte.</i>

257
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.900
I have business that's important with
Hyman Roth. I don't want it disturbed.

258
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.100
Then you give your loyalty to a Jew
before your own blood.

259
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.100
You know my father did business
with Hyman Roth. He respected him.

260
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:21.000
Your father did business with
Hyman Roth, he respected Hyman Roth,

261
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.400
but he never trusted Hyman Roth

262
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.000
or his Sicilian messenger boy,
Johnny Ola.

263
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.600
You'll have to excuse me. I'm tired,
and I'm a little drunk!

264
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.700
I want everybody here to know, there's
not going to be no trouble from me!

265
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.000
Don Corleone.

266
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.200
Cicci, the door...

267
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.800
You want him to leave now?

268
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.900
Let him go back to New York.
I've already made my plans.

269
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.500
The old man had too much wine.

270
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.000
It's late.

271
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.700
How's the baby?

272
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.200
-Sleeping inside me.
-Does it feel like a boy?

273
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.400
Yes, it does, Michael.

274
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.500
Kay?

275
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.100
I'm sorry about all the people today.
Bad timing.

276
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:45.600
It couldn't be helped, though.

277
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.900
It made me think
of what you once told me.

278
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.000
" In five years the Corleone family
will be completely legitimate. "

279
00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.000
That was seven years ago.

280
00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.200
I know. I'm trying, darling.

281
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.000
Did you see this?

282
00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.700
Why are the drapes open?

283
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.300
Kay, are you all right?

284
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.000
-Are you hit?
-No.

285
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.700
It's all right.

286
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.500
Stop! Stop!

287
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.700
Halt!

288
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.500
They're still on the property.
Please stay inside.

289
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.800
-Keep them alive.
-We'll try.

290
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.400
Alive!

291
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.600
Stay by the door.

292
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Yeah, come in.

293
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.000
-Mike, are you all right?
-Yeah.

294
00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:11.100
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.

295
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.200
And I know that's upset you in the past.

296
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.500
You felt it was because of
some lack of trust or confidence.

297
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.600
But it's because I admire you
and love you

298
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.600
that I kept things secret from you.

299
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.200
Now you're the only one I can trust.

300
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.900
Fredo?

301
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.500
Well, he's got a good heart.

302
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:47.200
But he's weak and he's stupid,
and this is life and death.

303
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.200
Tom, you're my brother.

304
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.100
I always wanted to be thought of as
a brother by you, Mikey. A real brother.

305
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.600
I know that.

306
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.000
You're going to take over.

307
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.300
You're going to be the Don.

308
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.700
If what I think has happened,
has happened, I'm leaving here tonight.

309
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:33.600
I give you complete power. Over Fredo
and his men. Rocco, Neri, everyone.

310
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.000
I'm trusting you
with the lives of my wife

311
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.100
and my children,
the future of this family.

312
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.400
-If we catch them, will we find out...
-We won't catch them.

313
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.900
Unless I'm very wrong,
they're dead already.

314
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.700
They were killed by somebody
close to us.

315
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.400
Inside. Very, very frightened
that they botched it.

316
00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.100
You don't think that Rocco and Neri
had something to do with this?

317
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.700
See... All our people are businessmen.

318
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.500
Their loyalty is based on that.

319
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.500
One thing I learned from Pop

320
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.300
was to try to think
as people around you think.

321
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.300
On that basis, anything is possible.

322
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.000
Mike, they're dead!
Right outside my window!

323
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.300
I want to get out of here.
They're lying there dead!

324
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.200
Over here! There's two of them.

325
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:04.500
Looks like they were hired
out of New York. I don't recognize them.

326
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:07.900
Won't get anything out of them now.

327
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.200
Fish them out.

328
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.000
Get rid of the bodies.

329
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.000
-Where's Mike?
-Rocco.

330
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.500
Anthony, everything is going to be
all right. Try to sleep.

331
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.200
-Did you like your party?
-I got lots of presents.

332
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.700
I know. Did you like them?

333
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.200
Yeah. I didn't know the people
who gave them to me.

334
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.500
Well, they were friends.

335
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.800
-Did you see my present for you?
-It was on my pillow.

336
00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:58.400
I'm going to be leaving
very early tomorrow.

337
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.600
-Will you take me?
-No, I can't, Anthony.

338
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:08.600
-Why do you have to go?
-I have to do business.

339
00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.400
I could help you.

340
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.900
I know. Some day you will.

341
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.300
Get some sleep.

342
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.800
She's really beautiful.
You've got to see her.

343
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:05.700
Wait till you see her.
Words can't describe her.

344
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.000
I left Naples. I left Mama.

345
00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.100
For a no-good tramp!

346
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.500
Now here I am in America,
in New York.

347
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.900
Alone! Thinking of my mother.

348
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.100
Without news from home.

349
00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.100
Finally, a letter from Naples!

350
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.000
Vito, how do you like my little angel?
Isn't she beautiful?

351
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.900
She's very beautiful.

352
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:03.400
To you, she's beautiful. For me,
there's only my wife and son.

353
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.000
Our dear mother -

354
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:10.300
...is dead!

355
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.900
We'll go backstage later
and take her to eat.

356
00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.300
Sit down, you bum!

357
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Oh, excuse me, Don Fanucci.

358
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.200
We'll go see her backstage.

359
00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:39.800
Who was that?

360
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.300
The Black Hand.

361
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.300
That's Fanucci...the Black Hand.

362
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.800
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

363
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.000
Tomorrow! Always tomorrow!

364
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.700
You'll pay me today!

365
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.600
Let's go.

366
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.000
Not my daughter! Let her go!

367
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.600
Here, take all my money!

368
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.300
Vito, come on.

369
00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.000
I know what you're thinking. But
you don't know how things are.

370
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.000
Fanucci's with the Black Hand.
The whole neighborhood pays him.

371
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.500
Even my father, in the grocery store.

372
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.000
If he's Italian...

373
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.500
...why does he bother other Italians?

374
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.000
He knows they have nobody
to protect them.

375
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.300
Forget that. Did you like my angel?

376
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.200
If you're happy, I'm happy.

377
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.300
Don't you feel well?

378
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.200
Is your boss treating you all right?

379
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.900
Forget it.

380
00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.900
Hey, you speak Italian?

381
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.000
Hide this for me!

382
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.600
Next week I'll come and get it!

383
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.600
Abbandando, meet my nephew!

384
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.600
How's business?

385
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.900
It's good, it's good.

386
00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.900
Fanucci's mad. Says the
neighborhood's getting sloppy.

387
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.100
People don't pay on time,
don't pay the full amount.

388
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.500
Says he's been too nice to everyone.

389
00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.600
So Fanucci's changing?

390
00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.500
Sure. He wants double
from everybody.

391
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.700
Even from my father.

392
00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.800
I'm a friend, right? So you'll
let him work here?

393
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.100
I've got some bad news.

394
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.900
I feel rotten about telling you this...

395
00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.700
But Fanucci...he's got a nephew...

396
00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.400
And you have to give him my job.

397
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.600
You've always been good to me,
ever since I came here.

398
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.000
You looked after me like a father.

399
00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.800
I thank you.

400
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.400
And I won't forget it.

401
00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.800
Vito!

402
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.700
Oh, no!

403
00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.200
Take this to your family.

404
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.900
Thanks anyway. But please,
I can't accept.

405
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.000
What a nice pear!

406
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.100
I'm Clemenza, you still
have my goods?

407
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:13.200
Did you look inside?

408
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.600
I'm not interested in things
that don't concern me.

409
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:33.200
A friend of mine has a nice rug.
Maybe your wife would like it.

410
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.800
Sure she would. But who has
money for a rug?

411
00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:49.300
It would be a present.
I know how to return a favor.

412
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.500
Yeah, sure.

413
00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.600
My wife would like it.

414
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.500
That son of a bitch! He isn't home!

415
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.400
Damn, he didn't even leave the key.

416
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:41.100
Well, he won't mind.

417
00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:53.800
Come on in.

418
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:58.000
Hey, Vito, come on in!

419
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.000
This is your friend's place?

420
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.700
This is a real palace.

421
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.900
One of the best.

422
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:37.500
Vito, give me a hand, will you?

423
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.000
Look how pretty it is, Santino!

424
01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.900
Come on in.

425
01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.300
It's all right. Hyman's in there.

426
01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.300
-Would you like a tuna sandwich?
-No, thank you.

427
01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.300
<i>...pick up of two by Holden.
Second and eight for S.C...</i>

428
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.200
-Mr. Roth?
-Come in, Michael.

429
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.700
Sit down, make yourself comfortable.

430
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.600
It's almost over.

431
01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:47.200
-Do you follow the football game?
-Not for a while I haven't.

432
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.900
I enjoy watching football
in the afternoon.

433
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.100
One of the things I love
about this country. Baseball too.

434
01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:03.400
Ever since Arnold Rothstein
fixed the World Series in 1919.

435
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.300
I heard you had some trouble.

436
01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.900
Stupid.

437
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
People behaving like that with guns.

438
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.700
The important thing is you're all right.

439
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.900
Good health is the most important thing.

440
01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.800
More than success, more than money.

441
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.000
More than power.

442
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.300
I came here because
there's going to be more bloodshed.

443
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.500
I wanted you to know,
so another war won't start.

444
01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.700
Nobody wants another war.

445
01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.600
Frank Pentangeli asked my permission
to get rid of the Rosato brothers.

446
01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.500
When I refused he tried to have me
killed. He was stupid, I was lucky.

447
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.600
I'll visit him soon.

448
01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:17.500
The important thing is that nothing
interferes with our plans for the future.

449
01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.100
Nothing is more important.

450
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:28.000
-You're a wise and considerate man.
-And you're a great man, Mr. Roth.

451
01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:34.000
-There's much I can learn from you.
-Whatever I can do to help, Michael.

452
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.900
-Excuse me. Lunch.
-Come in.

453
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.800
-Thank you, my dear.
-You're going to break your eardrums.

454
01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.300
-Enjoy it.
-Thank you.

455
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.700
You're young, I'm old and sick.

456
01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.800
What we'll do in the next few months
will make history.

457
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.900
It's never been done before.

458
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.700
Not even your father would dream
that such a thing could be possible.

459
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.200
Frank Pentangeli is a dead man.
You don't object?

460
01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.600
He's small potatoes.

461
01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.800
What's up?

462
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.600
We got company?

463
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.700
What's going on?

464
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.800
Michael Corleone is here.

465
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200
Where is he?

466
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.200
He's in your den. You better hurry.

467
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.900
He's been waiting a half hour.

468
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.300
Is something wrong?

469
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.200
I wish you would have let me know
you were coming.

470
01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:24.200
-I could have prepared something.
-I didn't want you to know.

471
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:35.800
-You heard what happened?
-I almost died. We were so relieved...

472
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.000
In my home!

473
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.000
In my bedroom where my wife sleeps!

474
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.100
Where my children come to play.

475
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.800
In my home.

476
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.800
I want you to help me take my revenge.

477
01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:16.500
Michael, anything. What can I do?

478
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:23.000
Settle these troubles
with the Rosato brothers.

479
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.700
I don't understand. I don't...

480
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:30.800
I don't have your brain for big deals.
But this is a street thing.

481
01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:35.600
That Hyman Roth in Miami.
He's backing up those sons-of-bitches.

482
01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:40.500
-I know he is.
-So why ask me to lay down to them?

483
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.700
It was Hyman Roth
that tried to have me killed.

484
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.000
I know it was him.

485
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.200
Jesus Christ, Mike.

486
01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.000
Jesus Christ, let's get them all.
Now while we've got the muscle.

487
01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.000
This used to be my father's old study.

488
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.500
It's changed.

489
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.600
I remember there used to be
a big desk here.

490
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:27.000
I remember when I was a kid. We had
to be quiet when we played near here.

491
01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.300
I was very happy that this house
never went to strangers.

492
01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.400
First Clemenza took it over. Now you.

493
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:49.700
My father taught me many things here.
He taught me in this room.

494
01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:00.200
He taught me, "Keep your friends close,
but your enemies closer. "

495
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:06.400
If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
in this, in the Rosato brothers' favor,

496
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.000
he'll think his relationship with me
is still good.

497
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.200
That's what I want him to think.

498
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.100
I want him relaxed and confident
in our friendship.

499
01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.700
Then I'll be able to find out
who the traitor in my family was.

500
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.700
<i>-Yeah?
-Fredo, this is Johnny Ola.</i>

501
01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.200
<i>-We need some more help.
-Johnny?</i>

502
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.200
Jesus Christ, what the hell time is it?

503
01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.100
<i>-Who's that, honey?
-Listen good, Fredo.</i>

504
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.500
Why are you calling me?
I don't want to talk to you.

505
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.000
<i>Pentangeli is going to accept
the Rosato brothers' deal.</i>

506
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.300
<i>-Oh, God.
-Will he come alone?</i>

507
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.600
I don't know. You've got me in
deep enough already.

508
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.900
<i>Everything will be all right. Pentangeli
says he's willing to make a deal.</i>

509
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:29.500
<i>All we want to know is if he's on
the level, or if he'll bring his boys.</i>

510
01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.800
You lied to me. I don't want you
to call me anymore.

511
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.900
<i>-Your brother won't find out we talked.
-I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

512
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:52.300
-Who was that?
-Wrong number.

513
01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.700
-Frankie, I've got nobody here.
-Wait in the car, Cicc'.

514
01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.500
-Frankie.
-That's okay, Cicc'.

515
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.800
-What's this?
-A lucky C note for our new deal.

516
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.300
Ritchie. Give us a taste.

517
01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.500
We were all real happy
about your decision, Frankie.

518
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.800
-You won't regret it.
-I don't like the C note, Rosato.

519
01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.600
I take that as an insult.

520
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.700
Michael Corleone says hello!

521
01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:01.200
Close the door!

522
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:03.300
Your friend the cop...

523
01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.000
Hey, Ritch. It's dark in here.
Are you open or closed?

524
01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.900
I just came in to clean up a little,
you know?

525
01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.300
What's the matter?

526
01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.500
-Is that something on the floor?
-Carmine, not here!

527
01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.100
Anthony!

528
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:28.100
You open this bar
and I'll blow your head in!

529
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.200
Freddy, it's good to see you.

530
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:23.400
-How is he?
-He's okay. He's in the back.

531
01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:29.600
Girls, take a hike.

532
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.800
In this room here.

533
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.200
-I want to talk to him alone first.
-Come on.

534
01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:52.600
I thought I could help you, Senator.

535
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.300
Hagen?

536
01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.600
-Listen, I did not...
-It's all right.

537
01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:08.600
-I didn't do anything.
-It's okay. You're very lucky.

538
01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:14.000
My brother Fredo operates this place.
He was called before anyone.

539
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.200
Had this happened some place else,
we couldn't have helped you.

540
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.400
When I woke up, I was on the floor.

541
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:30.800
-And I don't know how it happened.
-You can't remember?

542
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.200
I passed out.

543
01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.400
Just a game. Jesus.

544
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.400
Jesus, Jesus!

545
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.100
Jesus God!

546
01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.800
God!

547
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.500
I don't know, and I don't understand
why I can't remember.

548
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.800
Doesn't matter, just do as I say.

549
01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:32.400
Put in a call to your office.
Explain that you'll be there tomorrow.

550
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.100
You decided to spend the night at
Michael Corleone's house in Tahoe.

551
01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.800
-As his guest.
-I do remember that she was laughing.

552
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:50.600
We'd done it before, and I know
that I could not have hurt that girl.

553
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:55.500
This girl has no family.
Nobody knows that she worked here.

554
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.600
It'll be as though she never existed.

555
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:03.900
All that's left is our friendship.

556
01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.200
-Yes?
-Sorry, but we're not to let you through.

557
01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:27.500
-I'm just going to the market.
-We'll pick up anything you want.

558
01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.700
-Whose orders are these?
-Mr. Hagen's. He's coming.

559
01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:33.300
I'll speak to him.

560
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.600
I wanted to explain,
but I had business in Carson City.

561
01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.100
It's Michael's request for your safety.
We'll get anything you need.

562
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:52.600
-So I'm supposed to stay in my house?
-No, within the compound will be fine.

563
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.600
-We were going to New England.
-That's off.

564
01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.600
-Am I a prisoner?
-That's not how we see it, Kay.

565
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:03.800
Come on, kids.
We're going back to the house.

566
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:07.200
Joe.

567
01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.700
Cuba, Cuba!

568
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.800
Most respected gentlemen.

569
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:41.100
Welcome to Havana.

570
01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.400
I want to thank this distinguished group
of American industrialists

571
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.100
for continuing to work with Cuba

572
01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.900
for the greatest period of prosperity

573
01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.600
in her entire history.

574
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Mr. William Shaw,

575
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.900
representing
the General Fruit Company.

576
01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.000
Messrs. Corngold and Dant,

577
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:12.800
of United Telephone
and Telegraph Company.

578
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.600
Mr. Petty,

579
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.600
Regional Vice President of
the Pan American Mining Corporation.

580
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.300
Mr. Robert Allen
of South American Sugar.

581
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.500
Mr. Michael Corleone of Nevada,

582
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:34.700
representing our associates
in tourism and leisure activities.

583
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.400
And my old friend and associate
from Florida,

584
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.900
Mr. Hyman Roth.

585
01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:47.300
I would like to thank United Telephone
and Telegraph for their Christmas gift.

586
01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.800
A solid gold telephone.

587
01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:00.700
Perhaps you gentlemen
would like to look at it.

588
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.300
-Mr. President?
-Yes?

589
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:09.100
Could you discuss the rebel activity and
what this can mean to our businesses?

590
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.800
-Of course.
-Heavy stuff.

591
01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:16.600
I assure you that, although the rebels
have started a campaign in Las Villas,

592
01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:29.000
my staff indicates, with assurance,
that we'll drive them out of Santa Clara

593
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.100
before the New Year.

594
01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.900
I want to put you all at ease.

595
01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.000
We will tolerate no guerrillas
in the casinos or the swimming pools.

596
01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.500
He said that they're making an arrest,

597
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.300
and in a few minutes
he'll let us through.

598
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.500
Johnny...

599
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.600
It's nothing.

600
01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.100
Just some lousy bandits.
The police are cleaning them up.

601
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.600
<i>Viva Fidel!</i>

602
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:34.300
I hope my age is correct.
I'm always accurate about my age.

603
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.300
Make sure that everybody
sees the cake before we cut it.

604
01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.000
I'm very pleased

605
01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:49.700
you're all able to come from
such distances to be with me today.

606
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.100
When a man comes
to this point in his life,

607
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.900
he wants to turn over
the things he's been blessed with.

608
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:04.100
Turn them over to friends,
as a reward for the friends he's had

609
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:10.600
and to make sure that everything
goes well after he's gone.

610
01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:13.300
-Not for years.
-Hear, hear!

611
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.600
We'll see. The doctors would disagree,
but what do they know?

612
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.900
These are wonderful things
that we've achieved in Havana

613
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.100
and there's no limit
to where we can go from here.

614
01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.900
This kind of government knows
how to help business, to encourage it.

615
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
The hotels here are bigger
and swankier

616
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:38.500
than any of the joints in Vegas.

617
01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:42.100
We can thank our friends
in the Cuban government

618
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.900
which has put up half the cash with the
Teamsters, on a dollar for dollar basis

619
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.800
and has relaxed restrictions on imports.

620
01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:54.400
What I'm saying is that we have now
what we have always needed...

621
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:57.300
Real partnership with a government.

622
01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.300
Smaller piece.

623
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:05.000
You all know Michael Corleone
and we all remember his father.

624
01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.800
At the time of my retirement, or death,

625
01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:14.800
I turn over all my interests
in the Havana operation to his control.

626
01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:18.700
But, all of you will share.

627
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.700
The Nacionale will go
to the Lakeville Road Boys,

628
01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:26.100
the Capri to the Corleone family,

629
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.600
the Sevilla Biltmore also,

630
01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:32.300
but Eddie Levine will bring in the
Pennino brothers,

631
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.600
Dino and Eddie, for a piece

632
01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:37.500
and to handle the casino operations.

633
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.000
We've saved a piece
for some friends in Nevada

634
01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.900
to make sure that things go smoothly
back home.

635
01:23:47.100 --> 01:23:52.000
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
So, enjoy!

636
01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.500
<i>-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!</i>

637
01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:58.500
I saw an interesting thing happen today.

638
01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.000
A rebel was being arrested
by the military police.

639
01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:07.500
Rather than be taken alive, he exploded
a grenade he had in his jacket.

640
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:11.200
He killed himself and took a captain
of the command with him.

641
01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.100
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.

642
01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:21.700
But it occurred to me, that the soldiers
are paid to fight, the rebels aren't.

643
01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.600
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.

644
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:31.600
This country has had rebels
for 50 years. It's in their blood.

645
01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:35.500
I know, I've been coming here
since the Twenties.

646
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.400
We were running molasses
from Havana when you were a baby.

647
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.000
The trucks were owned by your father.

648
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.700
Michael.

649
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.000
I'd rather we talked about this
when we're alone.

650
01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.700
The two million never got to the island.

651
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.500
It mustn't be known
that you held back the money

652
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.100
because you worried about the rebels.

653
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.200
Sit down, Michael. Sit down.

654
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.600
If I could only live to see it,
to be there with you.

655
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.300
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.

656
01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:46.400
Here we are, protected. Free to make
our profits without Kefauver,

657
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:50.300
the goddamn Justice Department
and the FBI.

658
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.500
90 miles away, in partnership
with a friendly government.

659
01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:59.200
90 miles. It's nothing.

660
01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:05.400
Just one small step for a man looking
to be President of the United States

661
01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:09.000
and having the cash
to make it possible.

662
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.000
Michael,

663
01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.300
we're bigger than U.S. Steel.

664
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.100
Mikey, how are you? Okay?

665
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.100
<i>-Hi! Freddy Corleone.
-Mio frati.</i>

666
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.400
Jesus Christ, what a trip!

667
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.100
I thought, "What if somebody knows
what I've got in here".

668
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:03.000
Can you imagine that? Two million
dollars on the seat next to me.

669
01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:09.100
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.

670
01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:12.900
You want to count it?

671
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:20.900
What's going on? I'm totally in the dark.

672
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.800
The family is making an investment in
Havana. This is a gift for the President.

673
01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:30.300
That's great! Havana's great.

674
01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.000
It's my kind of town.

675
01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:40.000
-Anybody I know in Havana?
-Don't know. Hyman Roth, Johnny Ola?

676
01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:45.600
No. I've never met them.

677
01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:53.200
Listen, Mikey, I'm kind of...

678
01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:01.700
Kind of nervous from the trip.
Can I get a drink or something?

679
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.000
I thought maybe we'd go out together.

680
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:09.200
I know a place where
we can spend some time together.

681
01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.800
Sometimes I think I should have
married a woman like you did. Like Kay.

682
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.800
Have kids. Have a family.

683
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.800
For once in my life, be more like

684
01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:28.400
Pop.

685
01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:35.300
It's not easy to be a son, Fredo.
It's not easy.

686
01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.600
Mama used to say,
"You don't belong to me. "

687
01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:42.200
"You were left on the doorstep
by gypsies. "

688
01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.400
Sometimes I think it's true.

689
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.500
You're no gypsy, Fredo.

690
01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:52.700
Mikey, I was mad at you.

691
01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.000
Why didn't we spend time
like this before?

692
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.700
You want a drink, right? Waiter!

693
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:13.000
<i>Por favor...</i>

694
01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.200
-How do you say Banana Daiquiri?
-Banana Daiquiri.

695
01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.700
-That's it?
-That's it.

696
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.900
Uno Banana Daiquiri

697
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:25.200
and a club soda.

698
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.700
Senator Geary flies in from Washington
tomorrow

699
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.300
with some government people.

700
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.000
I want you to show them
a good time in Havana.

701
01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:48.000
-That's my specialty, right?
-Can I trust you with something?

702
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.300
Of course, Mike.

703
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.200
Later in the evening we're all invited
to the Presidential Palace

704
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.000
to bring in the New Year.

705
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:05.200
After it's over they'll take me home
in a military car, alone.

706
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.000
For my protection.

707
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:11.700
Before I reach my hotel,
I'll be assassinated.

708
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.600
-Who?
-Roth.

709
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.300
It was Roth who tried to kill me
in my home.

710
01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.600
It was Roth all along.

711
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:49.700
He acts like I'm his son, his successor.

712
01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:53.900
But he thinks he'll live forever
and wants me out.

713
01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:03.400
-How can I help?
-Just go along, as if you know nothing.

714
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.200
-I've already made my move.
-What move?

715
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.800
Hyman Roth won't see the New Year.

716
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:31.300
You're to take it easy,
he'll be back tomorrow.

717
01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:33.700
Fly in my own doctor from Miami.

718
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:36.200
I don't trust a doctor
who can't speak English.

719
01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:40.600
<i>-Gracias, señor.
-Buenas noches.</i>

720
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:46.200
-Honey, go to the casino.
-If you're feeling better.

721
01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.000
Feel fine.

722
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:54.000
-Play the bingo game.
-Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Paul.

723
01:31:56.500 --> 01:32:01.500
My sixth sense tells me Fredo brought
a bag full of money. Where is it?

724
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.600
-You're pulling out?
-Just want to... Just want to wait.

725
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.700
-How do you feel?
-Terrible.

726
01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.400
I'd give four million to be able to take
a painless piss.

727
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.800
-Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
-The Rosato brothers.

728
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.100
I know, but who gave the go-ahead?

729
01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.700
I know I didn't.

730
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:46.700
There was this kid I grew up with.
He was younger than me.

731
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:53.300
Sort of looked up to me, you know.
We did our first work together.

732
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:57.200
Worked our way out of the street.
Things were good.

733
01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:03.100
During Prohibition
we ran molasses into Canada.

734
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.300
Made a fortune. Your father, too.

735
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:14.000
As much as anyone,
I loved him and trusted him.

736
01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:22.600
Later on he had an idea to build a city

737
01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:26.500
out of a desert stop-over
for G. I.s going to the West Coast.

738
01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:32.100
That kid's name was Moe Greene

739
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:35.900
and the city he invented was Las Vegas.

740
01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.700
This was a great man.

741
01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.200
A man of vision and guts.

742
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:48.600
And there isn't even a plaque,
signpost or statue of him in that town.

743
01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.200
Someone put a bullet through his eye.

744
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:57.800
No one knows who gave the order.

745
01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:02.100
When I heard it, I wasn't angry.

746
01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:08.100
I knew Moe, I knew he was headstrong.
Talking loud, saying stupid things.

747
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.000
So when he turned up dead, I let it go.

748
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.900
And I said to myself,

749
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
"This is the business we've chosen. "

750
01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.400
I didn't ask

751
01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:30.100
who gave the order, because it had
nothing to do with business.

752
01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:43.200
That two million in a bag in your room...

753
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.100
I'm going in to take a nap.

754
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:55.000
When I wake, if the money
is on the table, I know I have a partner.

755
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:58.700
If it isn't, I know I don't.

756
01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:57.900
Does everybody know everybody?
You know Senator Geary.

757
01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:01.300
Good to see you, Mike.
I'm glad we spend this time together.

758
01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.300
Senator Payton from Florida...

759
01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.800
Judge DeMalco from New York...

760
01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:10.800
Senator Ream from Maryland...

761
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:13.400
Fred Corngold from UTT.

762
01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:17.400
-That Fred does a mean cha-cha-cha!
-He does?

763
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.900
Gentlemen, it's refill time!

764
01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:24.400
You might try some of the local drinks.
Cuba Libre, Piña Colada...

765
01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:28.400
I think I'll try
one of those redheaded Yolandas.

766
01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.300
-That you got! Con gusto...
-Johnny!

767
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:36.000
You don't know my brother Fredo.
Johnny Ola, Fredo.

768
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.800
-We never met. Johnny Ola.
-Pleasure.

769
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.500
Gentlemen, to a night in Havana!

770
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:45.300
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

771
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:48.400
<i>-Feliz Año Nuevo!
-Happy New Year.</i>

772
01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:04.200
-Hey, Freddy, why are we standing?
-Everybody stands.

773
01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:08.900
-It's worth it. You won't believe this.
-I don't believe it already.

774
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.200
-50 dollars, right?
-You've got a bet, mister.

775
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.900
That's Superman.

776
01:37:55.900 --> 01:37:58.100
Did I tell you or did I tell you?

777
01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.500
-I don't believe it!
-It's got to be fake.

778
01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.900
It's real. That's why
he's called Superman.

779
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.500
Hey, Freddy, where did you find
this place?

780
01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.000
Johnny Ola brought me here. I didn't
believe it, but seeing is believing!

781
01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.500
-I see it, but still don't believe it!
-50 bucks, Pat.

782
01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.200
Roth won't go here,
but Johnny knows these places!

783
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:28.100
-Watch, he'll break a cracker with it.
-I want to see him break a brick!

784
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.400
Relax, we're taking you to the hospital.

785
01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:45.000
...and you'll continue to get those.

786
01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:49.500
I don't believe that President
Eisenhower would ever pull out of Cuba

787
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.300
as we have over one billion dollars
invested in this country.

788
01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:00.100
The American public
believe in non-intervention...

789
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.100
Fredo! Where are you going?

790
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.900
I'm getting a real drink,
because I can't...

791
01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:06.000
What kept Mr. Roth?
I understood he was coming.

792
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.600
Reeves, what's the protocol?
How long should we stay?

793
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:15.900
I think a half hour ought to do it. Just
long enough to bring in the New Year.

794
01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.700
It's New Year's Eve. Come on,
just for a minute.

795
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.800
There's a plane waiting to take us
to Miami in an hour.

796
01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.600
Don't make a big thing about it.

797
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.800
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.

798
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:07.100
You broke my heart!

799
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.800
Due to serious setbacks to our
troops in Guantanamo and Santiago...

800
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.100
...my position in Cuba is untenable.

801
01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:01.600
I am resigning from office
to avoid further bloodshed.

802
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.500
And I shall leave the city immediately.

803
01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:12.800
I wish all of you good luck.

804
01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:23.200
<i>Salud!</i>

805
01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.800
<i>Viva la revolución! Viva Fidel!</i>

806
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:51.200
Fredo!

807
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:55.900
Come on. Come with me.
It's the only way out of here tonight.

808
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.400
Roth is dead.

809
01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.400
Fredo, come with me!
You're still my brother.

810
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.000
Fredo!

811
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.500
I'm Pat Geary, United States Senator.

812
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.500
Fidel! Fidel! Fidel!

813
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.300
Al. Get me a wet towel.

814
01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:59.700
Does Kay know I'm back?

815
01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.900
My boy? Did you get him
something for Christmas?

816
01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:10.400
-I took care of it.
-What was it, so I'll know.

817
01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:15.600
It was a little car with an electric motor
that he can ride in. It's nice.

818
01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:20.200
Thank you, Al.

819
01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:24.800
Fellows, could you step outside
for a minute?

820
01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:43.600
Where's my brother?

821
01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.800
Roth got out on a private boat.
He's in a hospital in Miami.

822
01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:52.500
He had a stroke, but recovered okay.
Your bodyguard is dead.

823
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:54.500
I asked about Fredo.

824
01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:58.900
I think he got out.
He must be somewhere in New York.

825
01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.300
All right.

826
01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:07.400
I want you to get in touch with him.

827
01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:10.300
I know he's scared.
Tell him everything is all right.

828
01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.800
Tell him I know Roth misled him. That
he didn't know they would try to kill me.

829
01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:20.900
-They can come in now.
-There was something else.

830
01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.400
What?

831
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.200
What? Come on.

832
01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:36.600
Kay had a miscarriage.

833
01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.900
-Was it a boy?
-At three and a half months...

834
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.900
Can't you give me a straight answer?
Was it a boy?

835
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.600
I really don't know.

836
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:19.800
Poor little Fredo, he's got pneumonia.

837
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.900
Young man, I hear you and
your friends are stealing goods.

838
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:13.000
But you don't even send a
dress to my house. No respect!

839
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.700
You know I've got three daughters.

840
01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:17.800
This is my neighborhood.

841
01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:22.100
You and your friends should
show me some respect.

842
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.900
You should let me wet
my beak a little.

843
01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:32.900
I hear you and your friends
cleared $600 each.

844
01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:38.100
Give me $200 each, for your own
protection. And I'll forget the insult.

845
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.500
You young punks have to learn
to respect a man like me!

846
01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:48.200
Otherwise the cops will
come to your house.

847
01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.200
And your family will be ruined.

848
01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:57.800
Of course if I'm wrong about how much
you stole - I'll take a little less.

849
01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.400
And by less, I only mean -
a hundred bucks less.

850
01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:04.600
Now don't refuse me.

851
01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:08.300
Understand, paisan?

852
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.200
I understand.

853
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:23.300
My friends and I share all the money.
So first, I have to talk to them.

854
01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:29.100
Tell your friends I don't want a lot.
Just enough to wet my beak.

855
01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:35.600
Don't be afraid to tell them!

856
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.800
600 bucks...

857
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.300
Suppose we don't pay?

858
01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:46.900
You know his gang, Tessio.
Real animals.

859
01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:51.100
Maranzalla himself let Fanucci
work this neighborhood.

860
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.500
He's got connections with the cops, too.
We have to pay him.

861
01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:58.100
$200 each...everybody agreed?

862
01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:04.200
Why do we have to pay him?

863
01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:07.100
Vito, leave this to us.

864
01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:11.200
He's one person, we're three.

865
01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:14.100
He's got guns, we've got guns.

866
01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:18.000
Why should we give him the
money we sweated for?

867
01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:20.500
This is his neighborhood!

868
01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.700
I know two bookies who don't give
anything to Fanucci.

869
01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.700
Who?

870
01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:33.100
Joe The Greek and Frank Pignattaro.

871
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.700
They don't pay Fanucci.

872
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:41.400
If they don't pay Fanucci, then
somebody else collects for Maranzalla!

873
01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:46.500
We'll all be better off if we
pay him. Don't worry.

874
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.900
Now what I say stays in this room.

875
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:09.900
If you both like, why not give me
$50 each to pay Fanucci?

876
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:16.400
I guarantee he'll accept
what I give him.

877
01:54:19.100 --> 01:54:21.400
If Fanucci says $200...

878
01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:22.900
...he means it, Vito!

879
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.400
I'll reason with him.

880
01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500
Leave everything to me.

881
01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:33.200
I'll take care of everything.

882
01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:37.400
I never lie to my friends.

883
01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:41.200
Tomorrow you both go talk to Fanucci.

884
01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.000
He'll ask for the money.

885
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.600
Tell him you'll pay whatever
he wants. Don't argue with him.

886
01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:53.400
Then I'll go and get him to agree.

887
01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:58.400
Don't argue with him, since
he's so tough.

888
01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.800
How can you get him to take less?

889
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.600
That's my business.

890
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.400
Just remember that I did you a favor.

891
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:14.400
Is it a deal?

892
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.500
Yes.

893
01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.700
His family's out of the house.

894
01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.400
Fanucci's alone in the cafe.

895
01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:18.000
<i>Vito, here's my 50 dollars.
Buona fortuna.</i>

896
01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.700
Are you sure he's going to go for it?

897
01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:39.400
I'll make an offer he don't refuse.
Don't worry.

898
01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:17.100
It looks like there's -
$ 100 under my hat.

899
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.200
I was right.

900
01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:34.400
Only $ 100...

901
01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.000
I'm short of money right now.

902
01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:46.500
I've been out of work...so just
give me a little time.

903
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.600
You understand, don't you?

904
01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.400
You've got balls, young man!

905
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.500
How come I never heard
of you before?

906
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.400
You've got a lot of guts.

907
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:21.300
I'll find you some work
for good money.

908
01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:36.900
No hard feelings, right? If I can
help you, let me know.

909
01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:42.200
You've done well for yourself.

910
01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:48.200
Enjoy the festa!

911
02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.800
Oh, this is too violent for me!

912
02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:23.300
What've you got there?

913
02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:05.900
Michael, your father loves you
very much.

914
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.600
<i>Mr. Cicci, from the year 1942
to the present time,</i>

915
02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:38.200
<i>you were an employee
of the Genco Olive Oil Company?</i>

916
02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:40.300
<i>That's right.</i>

917
02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:45.400
<i>But in actuality you were a member
of the Corleone crime organization.</i>

918
02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:52.200
<i>No, we called it
the Corleone family, Senator.</i>

919
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:55.000
<i>What was your position?</i>

920
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.200
<i>At first, like everybody else,
I was a soldier.</i>

921
02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:02.200
<i>-What is that?
-A button, you know, Senator.</i>

922
02:10:02.300 --> 02:10:04.700
<i>No, I don't know. Tell me.</i>

923
02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:11.800
<i>When the boss says "push a button" on
a guy, I push a button. See, Senator?</i>

924
02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:13.300
<i>Mr. Questadt.</i>

925
02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:16.000
<i>-You mean you kill people?
-What?</i>

926
02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:21.200
<i>You kill people at
the behest of your superiors.</i>

927
02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.500
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

928
02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:32.000
<i>And the head of your family
is Michael Corleone?</i>

929
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.200
<i>Yeah, Counselor. Michael Corleone.</i>

930
02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.100
<i>Did you ever get such an order
directly from Michael Corleone?</i>

931
02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:42.000
<i>No, I never talked to him.</i>

932
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.000
<i>Mr. Cicci, could you amplify
your answer a bit?</i>

933
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.400
<i>-Do what?
-Could you expand on your answer?</i>

934
02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:55.300
<i>I'm particularly interested in knowing,
was there always a buffer involved?</i>

935
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:59.900
<i>Someone in between you
and your superiors who gave the order.</i>

936
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.500
<i>Right, a buffer.
The family had a lot of buffers!</i>

937
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:10.500
<i>You may find this very amusing, but
the members of this committee do not.</i>

938
02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.900
Tell me something, Ma.

939
02:11:45.100 --> 02:11:48.700
What did Papa think...
deep in his heart?

940
02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:57.200
He was being strong...

941
02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:05.300
Strong for his family.

942
02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:17.800
But by being strong for his family...

943
02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:21.100
...could he...

944
02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:24.300
...lose it?

945
02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:31.700
You're thinking about your wife...
about the baby you lost.

946
02:12:33.500 --> 02:12:36.800
But you and your wife can
always have another baby.

947
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.300
No, I meant...lose his family

948
02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:48.200
But you can never lose your family.

949
02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:59.500
Times are changing.

950
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.500
It's my pleasure.
I don't want money.

951
02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.000
Take it as a gift.

952
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:34.100
If there's something I can do for you,
you come, we talk.

953
02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:53.600
Signora Colombo, why did you
come to see me?

954
02:13:56.600 --> 02:14:00.100
Your wife told me to ask
if you could help me.

955
02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.700
She's in bad trouble.

956
02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.400
Her neighbors complained to the
landlord about her dog.

957
02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:13.100
He told her to get rid of the animal.

958
02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:18.900
But her little boy loves that dog.
So she hid it.

959
02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:23.400
When the landlord found out, he
got mad and told her to leave.

960
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:29.100
Now she can't stay even if she
gets rid of it.

961
02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:31.400
I'm so ashamed!

962
02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:36.200
He said he'd get the police to
throw us out on the street.

963
02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:40.700
I'm sorry, but...

964
02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:46.100
I could give you a couple dollars
to help you move.

965
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.400
I can't move!

966
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:51.700
I want you to talk to him!

967
02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:55.000
Tell him I want to stay here!

968
02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:04.300
What's your landlord's name?

969
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:06.900
His name is Signor Roberto.

970
02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.900
He lives on Fourth Street, near here.

971
02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:13.400
They break the windows,
they dirty the floors...

972
02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:16.000
A real pig-sty, eh?

973
02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:39.100
My name is Vito Corleone.
Signora Colombo is a friend of my wife.

974
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.300
She says she's been evicted
for no good reason.

975
02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:48.100
She's a poor widow, she has nobody
to take care of her.

976
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:52.400
She has no relatives, no money.
All she has is this neighborhood.

977
02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:56.400
I already rented the place
to another family.

978
02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:06.600
I told her that I'd talk to you.
That you're a reasonable man.

979
02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:11.700
She got rid of the animal that
caused all the trouble.

980
02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:14.200
So let her stay.

981
02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:15.900
Impossible.

982
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:18.100
Are you Sicilian?

983
02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:20.200
No, I'm Calabrese.

984
02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:24.100
We're practically paisan,
do me this favor.

985
02:16:24.700 --> 02:16:27.400
I already rented it!
I'll look like an idiot.

986
02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.700
Besides, the new tenants
pay more rent.

987
02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:33.600
How much more a month?

988
02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.900
Five bucks.

989
02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:43.800
Here's six months increase in advance.

990
02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:47.700
But don't tell her about it.
She's very proud.

991
02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:50.800
Come see me in another six months.

992
02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.300
Of course, the dog stays. Right?

993
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.200
The dog stays.

994
02:17:01.800 --> 02:17:05.100
Who the hell are you
to come give me orders?

995
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:09.500
Watch out or I'll kick your Sicilian ass
right into the street!

996
02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.700
Do me this favor.

997
02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:16.700
I won't forget it.

998
02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.800
Ask your friends in the
neighborhood about me.

999
02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:24.600
They'll tell you I know how
to return a favor.

1000
02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:33.400
What a character!

1001
02:17:41.300 --> 02:17:46.200
That landlord is here... Roberto,
the one who owns those ratholes.

1002
02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.100
He's been asking all around
the neighborhood about you.

1003
02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:07.900
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
Don Vito.

1004
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.300
What can I do for you, Don Roberto?

1005
02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:15.300
What a misunderstanding! Holy Mary!

1006
02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:19.500
Of course Signora Colombo can stay!

1007
02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.700
I'm giving back the money you gave me.

1008
02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:36.100
Un, due, three, four, five, six, tutt'!

1009
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:41.800
Because after all, Don Vito,
money isn't everything.

1010
02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:52.100
Can I sit down?

1011
02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:58.200
Your kindness to that widow
made me ashamed of myself.

1012
02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:02.200
The rent stays like before!

1013
02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:13.300
I'll even lower it.

1014
02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:17.400
I'll lower it $5.

1015
02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:23.300
I'll lower it $ 10!

1016
02:19:29.700 --> 02:19:31.800
Can I offer you some coffee?

1017
02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:38.800
I'm late for an appointment! I can't
this time! Ask me another time!

1018
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.700
You'll have to excuse me for now.

1019
02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:54.200
I wish I could stay longer!

1020
02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:02.600
Just call me and I'll be here!

1021
02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:16.500
He won't be back. He'll hide out
in the Bronx!

1022
02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:37.000
-Vito, what do you think?
-We'll make a big business!

1023
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.200
<i>-New York City.
-Would you speak up, please?</i>

1024
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:49.500
<i>New York City.</i>

1025
02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:53.200
<i>-Are you the son of Vito CorIeone?
-Yes, I am.</i>

1026
02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:57.000
<i>-Where was he born?
-CorIeone, SiciIy.</i>

1027
02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:03.100
<i>Did he at times use an aIias that was
known in certain circIes as Godfather?</i>

1028
02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:10.000
<i>Godfather is a term used by his friends.
One of affection and respect.</i>

1029
02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:15.300
<i>Mr. Chairman, I wouId Iike to verify
the witness' statement.</i>

1030
02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.500
<i>For years many of my constituents
have been of ItaIian descent.</i>

1031
02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:23.300
<i>I've come to know them weII.</i>

1032
02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:27.600
<i>They have honored me
with their support and their friendship.</i>

1033
02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:32.900
<i>I can proudly say that some of my
very best friends are ItaIian-Americans.</i>

1034
02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:39.200
<i>However, Mr. Chairman, unfortunateIy
I have to Ieave these proceedings</i>

1035
02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:43.600
<i>in order to preside over a very important
meeting of my own committee.</i>

1036
02:21:44.700 --> 02:21:47.700
<i>Before I Ieave, I do want to say this,</i>

1037
02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:52.100
<i>that these hearings on the Mafia
are in no way whatsoever</i>

1038
02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:54.800
<i>a sIur upon the great ItaIian peopIe.</i>

1039
02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:58.100
<i>I can state from my own knowIedge
and experience</i>

1040
02:21:58.100 --> 02:22:03.300
<i>that ItaIian-Americans are among
the most IoyaI, most Iaw-abiding,</i>

1041
02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:06.900
<i>patriotic, hard-working
American citizens in this Iand.</i>

1042
02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
<i>It wouId be a shame, Mr. Chairman,
if we aIIowed a few rotten appIes</i>

1043
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.300
<i>to give a bad name to the whoIe barreI.</i>

1044
02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:21.000
<i>Because from the time of Christopher
CoIumbus to the time of Enrico Fermi</i>

1045
02:22:21.100 --> 02:22:23.200
<i>to the present day,</i>

1046
02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:27.600
<i>ItaIian-Americans have been pioneers
in buiIding and defending our nation.</i>

1047
02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:33.300
<i>They are the saIt of the earth, and
one of the backbones of this country.</i>

1048
02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.200
<i>I'm sure we aII agree
with our esteemed coIIeague.</i>

1049
02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:47.600
<i>Mr. CorIeone, you have been advised
as to your IegaI rights.</i>

1050
02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:53.100
<i>We have testimony from
a previous witness, one WiIIi Cicci.</i>

1051
02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:58.500
<i>He stated that you are head of the most
powerfuI Mafia famiIy in the country.</i>

1052
02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:00.900
<i>-Are you?
-No, I'm not.</i>

1053
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.300
<i>He testified that you are
personaIIy responsibIe</i>

1054
02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:08.400
<i>for the murder of a New York
poIice captain in 1947</i>

1055
02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:12.000
<i>and with him a man
named VirgiI SoIIozzo.</i>

1056
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:14.700
<i>-Do you deny this?
-Yes, I do.</i>

1057
02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:18.000
<i>Is it true that in the year 1950</i>

1058
02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:23.400
<i>you devised the murder of the heads
of "the Five FamiIies" in New York</i>

1059
02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:27.100
<i>to assume and consoIidate
your nefarious power?</i>

1060
02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:30.500
<i>-It's a compIete faIsehood.
-Mr. Questadt.</i>

1061
02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:35.400
<i>Is it true you have a controIIing interest
in three major hoteIs in Las Vegas?</i>

1062
02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:41.700
<i>No, it's not true. I own some stock in
some of the hoteIs there, but very IittIe.</i>

1063
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:48.500
<i>I aIso have stock in IBM and IT&T.</i>

1064
02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:55.900
<i>Do you have any controI over gambIing
and narcotics in New York State?</i>

1065
02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.500
<i>No, I do not.</i>

1066
02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:01.200
<i>Senator, my cIient
wouId Iike to read a statement.</i>

1067
02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:06.900
<i>Mr. Chairman, I think this statement
is totaIIy out of order at this time.</i>

1068
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:12.900
<i>Sir, my cIient has answered this
committee's questions with sincerity.</i>

1069
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.900
<i>He hasn't taken the Fifth Amendment,
so this statement shouId be heard!</i>

1070
02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:25.800
<i>No, I'll allow Mr. Corleone to read
his statement. I'II put it in the record.</i>

1071
02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:30.800
<i>In the hopes of cIearing
my famiIy name</i>

1072
02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:34.800
<i>to give my chiIdren their share
of the American way of Iife</i>

1073
02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:38.000
<i>without a bIemish on their name
and background,</i>

1074
02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:43.300
<i>I have appeared before this committee
and given it aII my cooperation.</i>

1075
02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:50.200
<i>I consider it a great personaI dishonor
to have to deny that I am a criminaI.</i>

1076
02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:54.600
<i>I wish to have the foIIowing noted
for the record...</i>

1077
02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:58.800
<i>That I served my country faithfully
in WorId War Two</i>

1078
02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:04.100
<i>and was awarded the Navy Cross
for actions in defense of my country.</i>

1079
02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:09.200
<i>That I have never been arrested
or indicted for any crime.</i>

1080
02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:13.300
<i>That no proof Iinking me to any
criminaI conspiracy</i>

1081
02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.300
<i>whether it is caIIed Mafia
or Cosa Nostra or any other name</i>

1082
02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:20.700
<i>has ever been made pubIic.</i>

1083
02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:22.800
<i>I have not taken refuge
behind the Fifth Amendment,</i>

1084
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:26.100
<i>aIthough it's my right to do so.</i>

1085
02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:34.500
<i>I chaIIenge this committee to produce
any witness or evidence against me</i>

1086
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:40.600
<i>and if they do not, I hope they wiII have
the decency to cIear my name</i>

1087
02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:44.300
<i>with the same pubIicity
with which they have besmirched it.</i>

1088
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:51.200
<i>I'm sure we're impressed. ParticuIarIy
with your Iove for our country.</i>

1089
02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:54.100
<i>We'II be in recess
untiI 10:00 a.m. Monday</i>

1090
02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:59.000
<i>when we wiII produce a witness who'II
corroborate the charges against you.</i>

1091
02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:04.200
<i>At which time you may very well
be subject to indictment for perjury.</i>

1092
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:08.800
<i>I remind you that you're stiII
under subpoena. Adjourned!</i>

1093
02:26:13.900 --> 02:26:15.600
Ten-to-one shot, you said.

1094
02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:20.400
A ten-to-one shot
he would take the Fifth, and I'd lose!

1095
02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:25.200
You sound like my bookie.
I owe that monkey my life.

1096
02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:29.800
-Well, just get a good night's sleep.
-Yeah.

1097
02:26:29.900 --> 02:26:32.000
You've got a big day tomorrow.

1098
02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:35.700
I've got you a new suit,
new shirt, new tie.

1099
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:39.700
I'll shave you myself in the morning.

1100
02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:43.900
You'll look respectable for 50 million
of your fellow Americans.

1101
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.200
Tomorrow... My life won't be worth
a nickel after tomorrow.

1102
02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.900
Come on! I saw this 19 times.

1103
02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:58.700
You've got a great home here,
for the rest of your life.

1104
02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:02.000
Nobody gets near you,
you're not going anywhere.

1105
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:07.100
That's great. Beautiful.
Some deal I made.

1106
02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:10.000
You'll live like a king. You'll be a hero.

1107
02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:12.900
You'll live better here
than most people outside.

1108
02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.400
Some deal!

1109
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.800
Alive. Pentangeli is alive.

1110
02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.900
-How did they get their hands on him?
-Roth. He engineered it, Michael.

1111
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.100
When Frankie went to make a deal with
the Rosato brothers

1112
02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:34.300
they tried to kill him.

1113
02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:36.600
He thought you double-crossed him.

1114
02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:41.000
Our people with the detectives
said he was half dead, scared

1115
02:27:41.100 --> 02:27:43.800
and shouted that you'd turned on him.

1116
02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:48.200
They already had him on possession,
bookmaking, murder one and more.

1117
02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:55.800
The FBI has him airtight.
He's on an army base, 24 hour guards.

1118
02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.600
We can't get to him. You've opened
yourself to five counts of perjury.

1119
02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:06.300
What about Fredo?
What does he know?

1120
02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:10.100
He says he doesn't know anything,
and I believe him.

1121
02:28:10.300 --> 02:28:14.600
Roth, he played this one beautifully.

1122
02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:24.600
I'm going to talk to Fredo.

1123
02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:06.600
I haven't got a lot to say, Mike.

1124
02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:10.700
We have time.

1125
02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:14.000
I was kept pretty much in the dark.

1126
02:29:15.300 --> 02:29:17.500
I didn't know all that much.

1127
02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.200
What about now? Is there anything
you can help me out with?

1128
02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:26.000
Anything you can tell me now?

1129
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.700
They've got Pentangeli.

1130
02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:49.000
I didn't know
it was going to be a hit, Mike.

1131
02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.500
I swear to God I didn't know.

1132
02:29:54.200 --> 02:29:58.600
Johnny Ola bumped into me
in Beverly Hills.

1133
02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:03.500
He said that he wanted to talk.

1134
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:11.200
He said that you and Roth
were in on a big deal together.

1135
02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:18.100
And that there was something in it
for me if I could help him out.

1136
02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.100
He said that you were being tough
on the negotiations

1137
02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:26.600
but if they could get a little help
and close the deal fast,

1138
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:30.700
it would be good for the family.

1139
02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:36.700
And you believed that story?
You believed that?

1140
02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:41.000
He said there was something in it
for me, on my own!

1141
02:30:41.100 --> 02:30:45.200
-I've always taken care of you, Fredo.
-Taken care of me?

1142
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:49.300
You're my kid brother!
You take care of me?

1143
02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:54.400
Did you ever think about that?
Did you ever once think about that?

1144
02:30:55.500 --> 02:30:59.700
"Send Fredo off to do this,
send Fredo off to do that!"

1145
02:31:00.300 --> 02:31:04.900
"Let Fredo take care of some
Mickey Mouse nightclub somewhere. "

1146
02:31:04.900 --> 02:31:08.000
"Let Fredo fetch somebody
at the airport!"

1147
02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:11.200
I'm your older brother,
but was stepped over!

1148
02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:15.100
-It's the way Pop wanted it.
-It's not the way I wanted it!

1149
02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:20.800
I can handle things, I'm smart!
Not like everybody says.

1150
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.900
Like dumb. I'm smart
and I want respect!

1151
02:31:32.500 --> 02:31:37.800
Is there anything you can tell me about
this investigation? Anything more?

1152
02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:51.800
The Senate lawyer, Questadt.
He belongs to Roth.

1153
02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:03.200
Fredo,

1154
02:32:05.700 --> 02:32:08.300
you're nothing to me now.

1155
02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:12.600
Not a brother, not a friend.

1156
02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:17.400
I don't want to know you,
or what you do.

1157
02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:21.500
I don't want to see you at the hotels.

1158
02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:24.200
I don't want you near my house.

1159
02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:30.800
When you see our mother, I want
to know in advance, so I won't be there.

1160
02:32:32.400 --> 02:32:34.000
You understand?

1161
02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:45.800
Mikey.

1162
02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.200
I don't want anything to happen to him
while my mother's alive.

1163
02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:49.600
There's more people
than at a ballgame in here.

1164
02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.900
-Hey, there's Willi Cicci!
-Frankie Five-Angels...

1165
02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:15.900
<i>This committee wiII come to order!</i>

1166
02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:21.500
<i>-State your name, pIease.
-Frank PentangeIi.</i>

1167
02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:25.300
<i>-Where were you born?
-Partinico, it's outside of Palermo.</i>

1168
02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.500
<i>Where do you Iive now?</i>

1169
02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:32.900
<i>I Iive in an army barracks
with the FBI guys.</i>

1170
02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:38.400
<i>We have here a witness
that wiII further testify</i>

1171
02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:44.900
<i>to MichaeI CorIeone's ruIe of a criminaI
empire that controIs aII gambIing.</i>

1172
02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:50.100
<i>This witness has had no buffer
between himseIf and MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1173
02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:53.400
<i>He can corroborate enough charges</i>

1174
02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:58.100
<i>for us to recommend a charge
of perjury against MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1175
02:34:58.300 --> 02:35:00.300
-Senator.
-Thank you, Chairman.

1176
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.200
<i>Mr. PentangeIi.</i>

1177
02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:10.100
<i>Mr. PentangeIi. Were you a member
of the CorIeone famiIy?</i>

1178
02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:15.300
<i>Did you serve under Caporegime,
Peter Clemenza,</i>

1179
02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.900
<i>and under Vito Corleone,
aIso known as the Godfather?</i>

1180
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:28.200
<i>I never knew any Godfather.</i>

1181
02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:32.900
<i>I have my own famiIy.</i>

1182
02:35:36.300 --> 02:35:38.900
<i>Mr. PentangeIi, you...</i>

1183
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.400
<i>You are contradicting
your own sworn statement.</i>

1184
02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:47.300
<i>I ask you again, sir,
here and now under oath...</i>

1185
02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:51.600
<i>were you at any time a member of
a crime organization</i>

1186
02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:53.600
<i>Ied by MichaeI CorIeone?</i>

1187
02:35:53.700 --> 02:35:56.700
I don't know nothing about that!

1188
02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:03.700
I was in the olive oil business
with his father

1189
02:36:03.700 --> 02:36:06.400
but that was a long time ago.

1190
02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:10.500
<i>We have a sworn affidavit.</i>

1191
02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:16.900
<i>Your sworn affidavit, that you murdered
on the orders of MichaeI CorIeone.</i>

1192
02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:21.500
<i>Do you deny this confession, and do
you reaIize what wiII happen if you do?</i>

1193
02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:24.800
<i>The FBI guys promised me a deaI</i>

1194
02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:30.600
<i>so I made up a Iot of stuff about
MichaeI CorIeone, just to pIease them.</i>

1195
02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:34.800
<i>But it was aII Iies. Everything!</i>

1196
02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.600
<i>They kept saying,</i>

1197
02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:42.700
<i>"MichaeI CorIeone did this"
and "MichaeI CorIeone did that".</i>

1198
02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:48.300
<i>So I said, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"</i>

1199
02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:54.700
<i>Mr. Corleone, would you kindly identify
the gentIeman sitting to your left?</i>

1200
02:36:54.700 --> 02:36:57.000
I can answer that.

1201
02:36:57.100 --> 02:36:59.500
His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.

1202
02:37:00.500 --> 02:37:04.800
<i>-Is he reIated to the witness?
-He is, I believe, his brother.</i>

1203
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:09.800
<i>-WiII he come forward and be sworn?
-He doesn't understand EngIish.</i>

1204
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
He came at his own expense
to aid his brother.

1205
02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:17.600
He's not under subpoena
and has an impeccable reputation.

1206
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:21.400
<i>-He knows nothing about this?
-To my knowledge, nothing.</i>

1207
02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:25.800
<i>I'm going to find out what happened!
This committee is now adjourned.</i>

1208
02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:28.600
<i>-The witness is excused.
-Senator!</i>

1209
02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:33.300
Senator! This committee
owes an apology!

1210
02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:37.800
This committee owes an apology.
Apology, Senator!

1211
02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:09.400
-Michael, excuse me.
-Hello, darling.

1212
02:38:09.900 --> 02:38:13.400
The children are outside. We're going.

1213
02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:17.400
What do you mean?
We're leaving tomorrow.

1214
02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.600
Rocco?

1215
02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:24.200
I'll be in my room, Mike.

1216
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.100
Michael, I'm not going back to Nevada.

1217
02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:33.600
I brought the children
to say goodbye to you.

1218
02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:39.200
I'm very happy for you.

1219
02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:43.900
I always knew you were too smart
to let any of them beat you.

1220
02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:49.900
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, I'm not going to stay long.

1221
02:38:50.100 --> 02:38:53.900
There are some things
I'd like to talk to you about.

1222
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.100
Things that have been on my mind,
changes I want to make.

1223
02:38:59.200 --> 02:39:02.300
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.

1224
02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:08.200
-I wasn't going to say anything...
-What do you mean, "too late"?

1225
02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:16.300
What really happened with Pentangeli?

1226
02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:27.300
-His brother came and helped him.
-I didn't even know he had a brother.

1227
02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.200
Where is he now?

1228
02:39:30.600 --> 02:39:33.200
He's on a plane, back to Sicily.

1229
02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:36.400
All he had to do was show his face.

1230
02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:43.000
It was between the brothers, Kay.
I had nothing to do with it.

1231
02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:54.700
I don't want you going!
Not you, not the kids. No.

1232
02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:59.800
You're my wife and my children.
I love you and won't allow it.

1233
02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:04.900
You say you love me,
but talk about allowing me to leave!

1234
02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:08.800
Things between men and women
will not change.

1235
02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:12.900
You've become blind!
Look what's happened to us.

1236
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.200
-Look what's happened to our son!
-Nothing's happened to him. He's fine!

1237
02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:21.600
-Anthony is not fine!
-I don't want to hear about it.

1238
02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:25.700
-Anthony is...
-I don't want to hear about it!

1239
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Over!

1240
02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:44.700
At this moment
I feel no love for you at all.

1241
02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:50.800
I never thought that would ever happen,
but it has.

1242
02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:07.200
Kay...

1243
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.200
We're leaving tomorrow.

1244
02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:16.100
Why don't you take the kids
back to their room?

1245
02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:22.000
-Michael, you haven't heard me.
-Kay, what do you want from me?

1246
02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:28.600
Do you expect me to let you go,
to let you take my children from me?

1247
02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:35.000
Don't you know me? Don't you know
that that's an impossibility?

1248
02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:39.000
That I'd use all my power
to keep that from happening?

1249
02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:42.200
Don't you know that?

1250
02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:45.800
Kay...

1251
02:41:48.700 --> 02:41:53.300
In time, you'll feel differently.

1252
02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:57.800
You'll be glad I stopped you now.

1253
02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:01.700
I know that.

1254
02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:07.100
I know you blame me
for losing the baby.

1255
02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:10.100
Yes.

1256
02:42:11.300 --> 02:42:14.100
I know what that meant to you.

1257
02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:18.200
I'll make it up to you, Kay.

1258
02:42:19.100 --> 02:42:21.900
I swear I'll make it up to you. I'll...

1259
02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:25.200
I'm going to change.

1260
02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:30.800
I'll change. I've learned that I have
the strength to change.

1261
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Then you'll forget about
this miscarriage

1262
02:42:36.800 --> 02:42:41.700
and we'll have another child.
And we'll go on, you and I.

1263
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:47.200
-We'll go on.
-Oh, Michael!

1264
02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:50.700
Michael, you are blind.

1265
02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:54.900
It wasn't a miscarriage.

1266
02:42:56.900 --> 02:42:58.400
It was an abortion.

1267
02:43:00.300 --> 02:43:05.500
An abortion, Michael.
Just like our marriage is an abortion.

1268
02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:09.900
Something that's unholy and evil!

1269
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.800
I didn't want your son, Michael!

1270
02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:18.500
I wouldn't bring another one
of your sons into this world!

1271
02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:22.900
It was an abortion, Michael.

1272
02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:28.700
It was a son and I had it killed
because this must all end!

1273
02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:34.400
I know now that it's over. I knew it then.

1274
02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:40.700
There would be no way, Michael,
no way you could ever forgive me.

1275
02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:45.900
Not with this Sicilian thing
that's been going on for 2,000...

1276
02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:56.700
-You won't take my children.
-I will.

1277
02:43:56.700 --> 02:44:01.100
-You won't take my children!
-They're my children too.

1278
02:45:30.900 --> 02:45:34.500
Fredo, give this to Grandmother.

1279
02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:51.300
Don Ciccio, it's Tommasino.

1280
02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:58.200
Allow me the honor of
introducing someone.

1281
02:47:58.600 --> 02:48:01.400
My partner in America, in New York.

1282
02:48:02.100 --> 02:48:03.900
His name is Vito Corleone.

1283
02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:07.200
We'll send him olive oil from here.

1284
02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:09.400
To his company in America.

1285
02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:17.500
They're olive oil importers, Don Ciccio.

1286
02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:32.800
We'd like your blessing, and your
permission to start work.

1287
02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:36.800
Where is this young man
from New York?

1288
02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.300
Have him come closer.

1289
02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:47.200
I can't see him so good.

1290
02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:57.800
My respects, Don Ciccio.
Give me your blessing.

1291
02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:02.100
Bless you!

1292
02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:05.500
What's your name?

1293
02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:14.100
You took the name of this town!

1294
02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.400
And what's your father's name?

1295
02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:20.200
His name was...Antonio Andolini.

1296
02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:24.200
Louder, I don't hear so good.

1297
02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:30.900
My father's name was
Antonio Andolini...

1298
02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.900
...and this is for you!

1299
02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:58.500
Michael, say goodbye.

1300
02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:03.100
Hi, Al.

1301
02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.200
Can I speak with you
for a second, Tom?

1302
02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:27.800
Tom, where's Mike?

1303
02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:31.100
Waiting for you to leave.

1304
02:52:33.700 --> 02:52:38.200
-Can I talk with him?
-Sorry, Fredo. No chance.

1305
02:52:38.800 --> 02:52:42.100
-Can I see him?
-He's in the boathouse.

1306
02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:57.600
Michael, it's Connie.

1307
02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:20.400
Michael...

1308
02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:26.900
I'd like to stay close to home now,
if it's all right.

1309
02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:37.700
Is Kay coming?

1310
02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:41.800
No.

1311
02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.800
Fredo's in the house with Mama.

1312
02:53:52.900 --> 02:53:56.800
He asked for you
and Tom said you wouldn't see him.

1313
02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:02.300
That's right.

1314
02:54:05.100 --> 02:54:08.500
Kids, why don't you go outside
for a while?

1315
02:54:12.100 --> 02:54:14.500
Please, I want to talk to you.

1316
02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Michael, I hated you for so many years.

1317
02:54:30.500 --> 02:54:35.800
I think I did things to myself,
to hurt myself, so that you'd know

1318
02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.100
that I could hurt you.

1319
02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:51.700
You were just being strong for all of us,
the way Papa was.

1320
02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:54.100
And I forgive you.

1321
02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:00.700
Can't you forgive Fredo?

1322
02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:06.400
He's so sweet,
and helpless without you.

1323
02:55:12.800 --> 02:55:16.600
You need me.
I want to take care of you now.

1324
02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.000
Connie.

1325
02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:12.800
Tom, sit down.

1326
02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:28.300
Our friend and business partner,
Hyman Roth, is in the news.

1327
02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:34.300
-Did you hear about it?
-I hear that he's in Israel.

1328
02:57:34.900 --> 02:57:39.500
The High Court in Israel
turned down his request to live there.

1329
02:57:39.700 --> 02:57:43.200
His passport's been invalidated,
except to return here.

1330
02:57:43.300 --> 02:57:46.100
He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday.

1331
02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:50.300
He offered them a million dollars
if they'd let him live there.

1332
02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:55.300
-They turned him down.
-He's going to try Panama.

1333
02:57:55.400 --> 02:58:00.100
Panama won't take him.
Not for a million, not for ten million.

1334
02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:05.100
His condition is reported as terminal.
He's only got six months left.

1335
02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:08.300
He's had the same heart attack
for 20 years.

1336
02:58:08.500 --> 02:58:12.600
-That plane goes to Miami.
-That's right. That's where I want it met.

1337
02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:19.200
Impossible. They'll turn him over to the
Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI.

1338
02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:22.500
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.

1339
02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:24.100
It would be
like trying to kill the President.

1340
02:58:24.200 --> 02:58:28.700
-There's no way we can get to him!
-Tom, you surprise me.

1341
02:58:31.500 --> 02:58:35.100
If anything in this life is certain,

1342
02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:38.400
if history has taught us anything,

1343
02:58:38.500 --> 02:58:41.100
it's that you can kill anyone.

1344
02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:51.400
-Rocco?
-Difficult. Not impossible.

1345
02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:53.400
Good.

1346
02:58:55.900 --> 02:58:59.400
Why did you ask me if something
was wrong when I came in?

1347
02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:09.000
I thought you were going to tell me that
you were moving your family to Vegas

1348
02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:14.300
and that you'd been offered the Vice
Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.

1349
02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:21.300
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?

1350
02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:28.300
-Let's do business.
-All right.

1351
02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:33.100
Just consider this, Michael.
Just consider it.

1352
02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:36.500
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.

1353
02:59:36.600 --> 02:59:39.100
Are they worth it,
are they strong enough?

1354
02:59:39.600 --> 02:59:44.500
Is it worth it? You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?

1355
02:59:44.600 --> 02:59:50.000
I don't feel I have to wipe everybody
out, Tom. Just my enemies, that's all.

1356
02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:00.300
Are you with me in these things,
or what?

1357
03:00:02.500 --> 03:00:07.900
Because if not, you can take your wife,
your family and your mistress

1358
03:00:08.100 --> 03:00:11.200
and move them all to Las Vegas.

1359
03:00:14.300 --> 03:00:19.400
Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've
always been loyal to you. What is this?

1360
03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:25.600
So...you're staying?

1361
03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:30.000
Yes, I'm staying.

1362
03:00:32.600 --> 03:00:34.700
What do you want me to do?

1363
03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:37.200
Hey, Anthony.

1364
03:00:37.700 --> 03:00:42.400
How would you like it if I taught you
how to catch the really big fish?

1365
03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:45.000
-Would you like that?
-Okay.

1366
03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:47.800
You know, when I was your age,

1367
03:00:48.200 --> 03:00:55.100
I went out fishing with all my brothers
and my father. Everybody.

1368
03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.800
I was the only one that caught a fish.

1369
03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:04.800
Nobody else could catch one.
Do you know how I did it?

1370
03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:10.200
Every time I put the line in the water
I said a Hail Mary

1371
03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:14.000
and every time I said a Hail Mary,
I caught a fish.

1372
03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:20.600
Do you believe that? It's true.
That's the secret.

1373
03:01:22.700 --> 03:01:26.500
-Do you want to try it out on the lake?
-Okay.

1374
03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:29.600
What else have you got?

1375
03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:58.800
Everything will be okay.

1376
03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:02.900
-Did my brother go back?
-Yeah, don't worry.

1377
03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:08.000
He's ten times tougher than me,
my brother. He's old-fashioned.

1378
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:12.300
He didn't want dinner,
just wanted to go home.

1379
03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:17.400
That's my brother! Nothing could get
him away from that two-mule town.

1380
03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.400
He could have been big here.
He could have had his own family.

1381
03:02:26.700 --> 03:02:28.600
Tom,

1382
03:02:29.300 --> 03:02:31.900
what do I do now?

1383
03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:34.600
Frankie.

1384
03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:43.200
You were always interested
in politics and history.

1385
03:02:44.700 --> 03:02:48.100
I remember you talking about Hitler
back in '33.

1386
03:02:48.300 --> 03:02:51.900
Yeah, I still read a lot.
I get good stuff in there.

1387
03:02:54.500 --> 03:03:00.200
You were around the old-timers, who
built the organization of the families,

1388
03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:05.800
basing them on the old Roman legions,
with "regimes," "capos" and "soldiers".

1389
03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:11.000
-And it worked.
-Yeah, it worked.

1390
03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:15.300
Those were the great old days,
you know.

1391
03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:18.600
We was like the Roman Empire.

1392
03:03:18.700 --> 03:03:22.200
The Corleone family
was like the Roman Empire.

1393
03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:26.500
Yeah,

1394
03:03:26.700 --> 03:03:29.100
it was once.

1395
03:03:33.500 --> 03:03:35.100
Frankie.

1396
03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:49.100
When a plot
against the Emperor failed

1397
03:03:50.300 --> 03:03:53.800
the plotters were always
given a chance

1398
03:03:55.700 --> 03:03:59.300
to let their families keep their fortunes.
Right?

1399
03:03:59.400 --> 03:04:01.500
Only the rich guys.

1400
03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:06.600
The little guys got knocked off and all
their estates went to the Emperors.

1401
03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:12.000
Unless they went home and killed
themselves, then nothing happened.

1402
03:04:13.200 --> 03:04:17.500
And their families were taken care of.

1403
03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:22.500
That was a good break, a nice deal.

1404
03:04:23.100 --> 03:04:24.600
Yeah.

1405
03:04:25.500 --> 03:04:27.600
They went home

1406
03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:31.800
and sat in a hot bath

1407
03:04:31.900 --> 03:04:34.500
opened up their veins

1408
03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:37.400
and bled to death.

1409
03:04:38.500 --> 03:04:42.700
And sometimes they had a little party
before they did it.

1410
03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.400
Don't worry about anything,
Frankie Five-Angels.

1411
03:04:51.800 --> 03:04:55.100
Thanks, Tom. Thanks.

1412
03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:16.700
-See you, Tom.
-Addio, Frankie.

1413
03:05:27.700 --> 03:05:30.800
Kay. You have to go.

1414
03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:35.900
-So pretty...
-Kay, please hurry. He's coming.

1415
03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:48.500
Anthony. Kiss Mama goodbye.

1416
03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:53.900
Anthony, kiss your mother goodbye!

1417
03:05:54.100 --> 03:05:59.200
Anthony, say goodbye to Mama.
Anthony. I love you, Anthony.

1418
03:06:00.300 --> 03:06:02.700
Kay, please.

1419
03:06:05.600 --> 03:06:07.600
All right.

1420
03:06:20.800 --> 03:06:23.200
Mary, come here.

1421
03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:32.000
Anthony.

1422
03:06:32.100 --> 03:06:35.100
Anthony, please. Kiss me once.

1423
03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:16.200
Easy.

1424
03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:25.100
Anthony! Anthony!

1425
03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:28.200
-He's here, we're going fishing.
-No!

1426
03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:31.700
Michael wants to take him to Reno now.

1427
03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:33.800
Shit!

1428
03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:38.500
Okay, kid, you have to go to Reno
with your pop.

1429
03:08:39.400 --> 03:08:43.400
-I'll take you fishing tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.

1430
03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.600
Hey, Anthony.

1431
03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:53.000
Listen, I'll catch one for you in secret.

1432
03:08:57.100 --> 03:08:58.500
Let's go.

1433
03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:41.800
-Mr. Roth, I must take you into custody.
-I understand.

1434
03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:45.100
What's your reaction
to the Israeli High Court ruling?

1435
03:09:45.300 --> 03:09:48.100
I'm a retired investor on a pension.

1436
03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:53.100
I went to Israel to live there as a Jew,
in the twilight of my life.

1437
03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:03.100
Hey, Frankie! Come on out,
let's play some Hearts.

1438
03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:12.900
Frankie!

1439
03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:31.700
Is it true you're worth
over 300 million dollars?

1440
03:10:31.900 --> 03:10:35.500
I'm a retired investor,
living on a pension.

1441
03:10:35.700 --> 03:10:39.200
I came home to vote
in the presidential election

1442
03:10:39.400 --> 03:10:42.800
because they wouldn't give me
an absentee ballot.

1443
03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:57.600
Jesus Christ.

1444
03:10:58.600 --> 03:11:03.300
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1445
03:11:04.700 --> 03:11:07.300
Blessed art thou amongst women.

1446
03:11:08.100 --> 03:11:11.300
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

1447
03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:16.700
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1448
03:11:58.600 --> 03:12:03.700
Hey! Everybody, pay attention.
This is my friend Carlo Rizzi.

1449
03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:07.300
-You know my brother Fredo.
-Sure.

1450
03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:12.200
This is my stepbrother Tom,
and that's his girl Theresa.

1451
03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:15.600
This cute little thing is my sister Connie.

1452
03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:18.500
Say hello to Carlo.
He's good-looking, isn't he?

1453
03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:20.200
Yes.

1454
03:12:20.400 --> 03:12:24.400
The droopy thing is Mike.
We call him Joe College.

1455
03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:28.800
Sit down. Talk to each other.

1456
03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.200
Hey, Mr. Einstein...

1457
03:12:34.500 --> 03:12:37.100
-The cake.
-Sally, get in here!

1458
03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:39.300
-I was scared.
-Come on.

1459
03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:43.400
-Where's your father?
-Christmas shopping.

1460
03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:45.900
Let's see that thing.

1461
03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:49.500
That's nice!

1462
03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:53.400
-Should I put the candles on now?
-Yeah. You help her, Carlo.

1463
03:12:54.600 --> 03:12:57.700
-What is that? Rum?
-Yeah.

1464
03:13:02.700 --> 03:13:06.000
Don't touch the antipasto
until Pop sees it.

1465
03:13:06.100 --> 03:13:08.800
He's not ugly...

1466
03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:20.600
What do you think of the nerve of those
Japs? Bombing us on Pop's birthday.

1467
03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:24.100
They didn't know it was Pop's birthday.

1468
03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:26.800
Not surprising after the oil embargo.

1469
03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:31.400
They've got no right dropping bombs!
Are you a Jap-lover?

1470
03:13:31.600 --> 03:13:35.300
-30,000 enlisted this morning.
-Bunch of saps...

1471
03:13:35.500 --> 03:13:39.000
-Why are they saps?
-Let's not talk about the war.

1472
03:13:40.100 --> 03:13:42.000
You talk to Carlo.

1473
03:13:43.900 --> 03:13:47.500
Only saps risk their lives for strangers.

1474
03:13:47.600 --> 03:13:51.000
-That's Pop talking.
-You're right, that's Pop talking!

1475
03:13:51.200 --> 03:13:55.000
-They risk their lives for their country.
-Country isn't your blood.

1476
03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.000
-I don't feel that way.
-Then quit college andjoin the army!

1477
03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:02.600
I did.

1478
03:14:03.500 --> 03:14:06.500
I've enlisted in the Marines.

1479
03:14:08.700 --> 03:14:11.900
-Why didn't you come to us?
-What do you mean?

1480
03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:16.300
-Pop managed to get you a deferment.
-I didn't ask for it.

1481
03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.100
I didn't want it.

1482
03:14:20.300 --> 03:14:22.700
Come on! Knock it off!

1483
03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:26.600
-Punk!
-Sonny, sit down.

1484
03:14:29.600 --> 03:14:33.100
Mommy, Daddy's fighting again!

1485
03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:39.000
Go and show Carlo the tree.

1486
03:14:49.300 --> 03:14:50.900
Nice.

1487
03:14:52.700 --> 03:14:54.300
Nice.

1488
03:14:54.900 --> 03:14:57.600
Break your father's heart
on his birthday.

1489
03:14:58.700 --> 03:15:01.400
That's swell, Mike. Congratulations.

1490
03:15:01.500 --> 03:15:03.700
Don't encourage him!

1491
03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:06.400
Get me a drink. Go on!

1492
03:15:10.300 --> 03:15:13.800
You don't understand.
Your father has plans for you.

1493
03:15:13.900 --> 03:15:18.100
Many times he and I have talked
about your future.

1494
03:15:19.900 --> 03:15:23.800
You've talked to my father
about my future?

1495
03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:29.300
-My future.
-Mikey, he has high hopes for you.

1496
03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:35.000
-I have my own plans for my future.
-Did you go to college to get stupid?

1497
03:15:35.100 --> 03:15:36.900
He's here!

1498
03:15:38.900 --> 03:15:40.900
Come on.

1499
03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:45.100
Stupid!

1500
03:16:02.300 --> 03:16:04.700
Surprise!

1501
03:16:07.800 --> 03:16:13.500
<i>For he's a joIIy good feIIow
For he's a joIIy good feIIow</i>

1502
03:16:13.700 --> 03:16:17.500
<i>That nobody can deny
Nobody can deny...</i>
