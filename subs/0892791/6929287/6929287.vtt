<i>[man] Once upon a time,
a long time ago,</i>

beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

3
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:51.094
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

4

<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

5

<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

6
00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:03.147

guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

7

<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

8

<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

9
00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.947

were forced to resort</i>

10
00:01:11.114 --> 00:01:12.657

It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.

And the other half
locked away in a tower.

is for things to go back

217

to the way they used to be!
Back when villagers

218
00:13:40.112 --> 00:13:43.240
were afraid of me, and I
could take a mud bath in peace.

"Ah! Get away! It's Shrek!
I'm so scared of him!"

How about the day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

A day some meddling oaf stuck
his nose where it didn't belong

[gasps] I know. What about a
day you wouldn't even remember?

297
00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:35.991
Like a day when you were a baby.

your childhood it is.

00:33:43.022 --> 00:33:45.107
You need to calm down!

505
00:33:45.274 --> 00:33:47.401
- I'm your friend.
- [mumbling]

506
00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:49.111
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

507
00:33:49.278 --> 00:33:52.114
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good. I'm gonna let go...

508
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:54.742
...right... now.

509
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:57.453
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

510
00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.081
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

511
00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:02.875
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

512
00:34:03.042 --> 00:34:05.086
Because... uh...

513
00:34:08.756 --> 00:34:10.091
OK.

514
00:34:14.262 --> 00:34:18.099

515
00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:22.478

517
00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:30.945

518
00:34:43.249 --> 00:34:45.501
[screaming]

519
00:34:47.962 --> 00:34:52.174
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

520
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:02.727
[toy squeaks]

521
00:35:13.654 --> 00:35:15.448
[toy squeaks]

522
00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:28.377
[Donkey] I've never seen an ogre cry.

523
00:35:33.841 --> 00:35:35.635
I'm not crying.

524
00:35:35.801 --> 00:35:37.803
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

525
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.890
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

526
00:35:41.057 --> 00:35:45.269
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

527
00:35:45.436 --> 00:35:49.690
- [sobs] That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

528
00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:51.734
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

529
00:35:51.942 --> 00:35:54.320
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

530
00:35:54.487 --> 00:35:56.072
By the way, why are you upset?

531
00:35:56.238 --> 00:35:59.116
I was tricked into signing
something I shouldn't have.

532
00:35:59.283 --> 00:36:01.577
You signed up for one
of them time-shares, huh?

533
00:36:01.744 --> 00:36:04.246
No. I signed this.

534
00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:07.583
[gasps] You should never sign
a contract with Rumpelstiltskin!

535
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.085
Yeah, I got that.

536
00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:11.295
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

537
00:36:11.462 --> 00:36:14.423
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

538
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.051
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

539
00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:18.386
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

540
00:36:18.552 --> 00:36:20.513
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

541
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.264
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

542
00:36:22.431 --> 00:36:24.767
There's nothing about
an exit clause in here.

543
00:36:24.934 --> 00:36:26.852
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

544
00:36:27.019 --> 00:36:29.271
Here, let me show you how it's done.

545
00:36:29.438 --> 00:36:30.940
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

546
00:36:31.107 --> 00:36:32.775
without picking up a few tricks.

547
00:36:32.942 --> 00:36:35.152
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

548
00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:37.613
the complexity of my
polygonic foldability skills.

549
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.073
What are you doing?

550
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.284
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

551
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:44.286
Thank you. OK,
here's what you gotta do.

552
00:36:44.453 --> 00:36:45.746
You fold this piece here,

553
00:36:45.913 --> 00:36:48.290
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

554
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:52.628
and if you do it just right, it
will show you what to do. There!

555
00:36:52.795 --> 00:36:55.089
"Try Lou's Bliss."

556
00:36:58.134 --> 00:37:01.137
- Who's Lou?
- Give me that!

557
00:37:06.475 --> 00:37:08.477
"True Love's Kiss."

558
00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:13.149
You have to take me to dinner first.

559
00:37:13.315 --> 00:37:17.319
[sighs] "According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

560
00:37:17.486 --> 00:37:20.990
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void."

561
00:37:21.198 --> 00:37:24.660
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

562
00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:29.623
If Fiona and I share true love's
kiss, I will get my life back!

563
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.668
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

564
00:37:34.336 --> 00:37:35.713
Well, that's just it, you see.

565
00:37:36.464 --> 00:37:37.840
I don't know.

566
00:37:38.007 --> 00:37:40.176
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

567
00:37:40.342 --> 00:37:43.179
So... where did you leave her last?

568
00:37:43.345 --> 00:37:48.350
The last time I saw her, I told her
I wished I'd never rescued her.

569
00:37:50.352 --> 00:37:53.481
- Oh, no.
- [Donkey] Shrek?

570
00:37:53.647 --> 00:37:56.233
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

571
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.527
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

572
00:37:58.694 --> 00:38:00.613
They keep dragons in there!

573
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.949
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

574
00:38:04.116 --> 00:38:06.994
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

575
00:38:14.168 --> 00:38:15.377
[panting]

576
00:38:17.797 --> 00:38:19.048
Fiona!

577
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:55.918
Oh, no.

578
00:39:06.846 --> 00:39:09.139
If I didn't save Fiona...

579
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:13.769
...then who did?

580
00:39:24.363 --> 00:39:27.366
This is the favor Fiona
was supposed to give me

581
00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:32.872
on the day we met.
It's a symbol of our love.

582
00:39:33.664 --> 00:39:34.790
Now smell it!

583
00:39:34.957 --> 00:39:36.834
Hey, man, get that dirty
favor out of my face!

584
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:40.546
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

585
00:39:40.713 --> 00:39:43.299
so stop complaining and start smelling.

586
00:39:43.465 --> 00:39:44.925
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

587
00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:46.802
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

588
00:39:46.969 --> 00:39:49.388
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

589
00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:52.308
If I was a dog, they'd
call me Dog, not Donkey!

590
00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:56.812
And another thing...
[sniffing] Wait a minute.

591
00:39:56.979 --> 00:39:58.814
I think I got something.

592
00:39:58.981 --> 00:40:01.275
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

593
00:40:01.442 --> 00:40:03.068
Luscious and tasty.

594
00:40:03.235 --> 00:40:05.821
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

595
00:40:07.406 --> 00:40:08.490
Donkey!

596
00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:10.701
[sniffing]

597
00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:14.580
Yeah! Waffles!

598
00:40:14.747 --> 00:40:18.083
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

599
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.837
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

600
00:40:22.004 --> 00:40:24.173
- Donkey! Don't eat that!
- [groans]

601
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:28.427
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

602
00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:30.346
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

603
00:40:30.554 --> 00:40:32.264
- Mmm-hmm...
- Oh, you...

604
00:40:32.431 --> 00:40:35.517
I'm just... What are you...?
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

605
00:40:35.726 --> 00:40:40.481
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

606
00:40:40.648 --> 00:40:42.316
- You did.
- Mmm... Ah!

607
00:40:42.483 --> 00:40:44.068
Uh-oh.

608
00:40:44.234 --> 00:40:45.444
- Oh!
- [creaking]

609
00:40:48.864 --> 00:40:49.990
Look out!

610
00:40:51.617 --> 00:40:52.868
[screaming]

611
00:40:53.035 --> 00:40:54.119
- Donkey!
- [Donkey] Ow!

612
00:40:54.286 --> 00:40:57.539
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. Ah!

613
00:40:58.874 --> 00:40:59.959
Donkey.

614
00:41:02.461 --> 00:41:04.046
[Donkey] Help! Help me!

615
00:41:04.213 --> 00:41:06.966
Help, Shrek! Help!

616
00:41:16.308 --> 00:41:20.104
[indistinct chattering]

617
00:41:30.781 --> 00:41:31.991
[man] Watch your head.

618
00:41:32.157 --> 00:41:33.492
Hey, it's a new guy!

619
00:41:33.659 --> 00:41:35.786
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

620
00:41:35.953 --> 00:41:37.663
He's really tiny, isn't he?

621
00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.915
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

622
00:41:40.082 --> 00:41:41.750
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

623
00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:43.669
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

624
00:41:43.836 --> 00:41:45.629
[grunts, groans]

625
00:41:48.007 --> 00:41:50.676
- Oh! Hey!
- Here you go.

626
00:41:53.846 --> 00:41:55.764
- [grunts]
- [cheering]

627
00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:58.767
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

628
00:41:58.934 --> 00:42:02.312
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

629
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:04.648
[nose trumpets]

630
00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:13.615
- [cheering]
- I didn't know we could do that.

631
00:42:13.824 --> 00:42:16.243
Help! You can't eat me!
I got the mange!

632
00:42:16.452 --> 00:42:20.831
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

633
00:42:20.998 --> 00:42:23.542
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

634
00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:25.794
Trust me, you don't
want to eat this one.

635
00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:28.005
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

636
00:42:28.172 --> 00:42:30.257
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

637
00:42:30.424 --> 00:42:32.342
- Your dinner is my friend!
- Come on, guys!

638
00:42:32.509 --> 00:42:33.844
- [trumpeting]
- I got to get the giblets out!

639
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:35.971
- She's back.
- [man] There she is.

640
00:42:53.822 --> 00:42:54.865
Fiona!

641
00:42:57.076 --> 00:42:59.661
I'm so happy I found you!

642
00:42:59.828 --> 00:43:03.290
[slow-motion shout]

643
00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:07.127
- [laughter]
- [groans]

644
00:43:07.336 --> 00:43:10.047
Maybe you missed orientation,
but for future reference,

645
00:43:10.214 --> 00:43:12.341
personal space is very important to me.

646
00:43:13.592 --> 00:43:15.469
You don't know who I am, do you?

647
00:43:15.636 --> 00:43:19.264
No. Brogan, I have news
from Far Far Away.

648
00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:21.642
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

649
00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:24.269
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

650
00:43:24.436 --> 00:43:26.438
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

651
00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:31.110
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

652
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.403
...we're married. Hear me out.

653
00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:36.323
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

654
00:43:36.532 --> 00:43:37.908
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

655
00:43:38.075 --> 00:43:40.119
and this boy kept saying, "Do the roar".

656
00:43:40.285 --> 00:43:42.704
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

657
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.207
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

658
00:43:47.709 --> 00:43:50.254
Right? Who's with me?

659
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.633
Whoa! I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

660
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.927
- [laughter]
- Fiona, I need to...

661
00:43:57.094 --> 00:43:59.054
- [bird calls]
- Witches!

662
00:43:59.221 --> 00:44:01.056
All right, everyone, you know the drill!

663
00:44:01.223 --> 00:44:03.016
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

664
00:44:03.183 --> 00:44:05.227
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

665
00:44:18.323 --> 00:44:19.658
[muffled protest]

666
00:44:34.173 --> 00:44:36.967
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

667
00:44:37.134 --> 00:44:40.679
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

668
00:44:42.347 --> 00:44:45.809
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

669
00:44:45.976 --> 00:44:49.062
Well, I see who wears the
chain mail in your family!

670
00:44:50.439 --> 00:44:52.065
[sighs]

671
00:44:52.232 --> 00:44:57.196
Some people like to look at
the goblet as... as half empty.

672
00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:02.034
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

673
00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:05.329
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

674
00:45:05.495 --> 00:45:08.999
But we're not just an empire.

675
00:45:09.166 --> 00:45:11.293
- We're a family.
- Oh!

676
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:12.794
Everyone has got their cupcake?

677
00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:15.214
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

678
00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.760
Good. Yeah, you know,
we have put away a lot of ogres.

679
00:45:19.927 --> 00:45:24.389
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

680
00:45:24.556 --> 00:45:26.642
It doesn't matter to me.

681
00:45:26.808 --> 00:45:29.561
It's not like it's the end of the world.

682
00:45:30.729 --> 00:45:33.649
Except... funny thing.

683
00:45:33.815 --> 00:45:37.319
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

684
00:45:37.486 --> 00:45:40.322
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

685
00:45:40.489 --> 00:45:43.659
it is the end of the world! Our world!

686
00:45:43.825 --> 00:45:47.496
- My empire!
- [squawks]

687
00:45:47.663 --> 00:45:51.708
[exhales deeply] But, as I was saying,

688
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:55.796
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

689
00:45:55.963 --> 00:45:59.383
- [witches moan]
- Yelling makes me so parched.

690
00:45:59.549 --> 00:46:01.885
Would anyone care for some water?

691
00:46:02.052 --> 00:46:03.387
- Wet your whistle?
- [shudders]

692
00:46:03.553 --> 00:46:06.431
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

693
00:46:06.598 --> 00:46:09.768
- ...of <i>agua purificada</i>?
- [grunts]

694
00:46:09.977 --> 00:46:12.521
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

695
00:46:12.688 --> 00:46:15.274
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

696
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.068
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

697
00:46:18.235 --> 00:46:19.361
Faster brooms?

698
00:46:19.528 --> 00:46:21.154
- No!
- Pointier hats?

699
00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:22.906
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

700
00:46:23.073 --> 00:46:25.659
- a professional bounty hunter?
- [grunts]

701
00:46:25.826 --> 00:46:28.662
What a world! What a world!

702
00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.208
Hmm! You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

703
00:46:33.375 --> 00:46:35.544
- [moans]
- I need a bounty hunter.

704
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:38.922
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

705
00:46:39.089 --> 00:46:42.342
...then I think I might know
just the person!

706
00:46:44.636 --> 00:46:48.890
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

707
00:46:49.057 --> 00:46:52.227
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

708
00:46:52.394 --> 00:46:54.062
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

709
00:46:54.229 --> 00:46:56.064
- I bet that's because of us.
- Shh!

710
00:46:56.231 --> 00:46:57.983
If that cupcake-eating clown

711
00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:01.820
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

712
00:47:01.987 --> 00:47:04.406
- ...he'll be vulnerable.
- The plan's simple.

713
00:47:04.573 --> 00:47:08.910
If they follow the usual patrol route,
they'll reach the river by midnight.

714
00:47:09.077 --> 00:47:12.581
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

715
00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:16.084
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

716
00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:18.086
And then we attack!

717
00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:27.137
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

718
00:47:27.304 --> 00:47:29.056
That's my chimichanga stand.

719
00:47:29.222 --> 00:47:31.850
Um... No, Cookie.
We won't be needing that.

720
00:47:32.017 --> 00:47:35.771
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

721
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.398
Go and finish your little speech.

722
00:47:39.107 --> 00:47:42.611
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

723
00:47:42.778 --> 00:47:46.448
Rumpelstiltskin is gone and
the chimichangas have been eaten.

724
00:47:46.615 --> 00:47:49.284
Far Far Away will finally be free.

725
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:51.203
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

726
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.414
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

727
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:56.792
[indistinct chattering]

728
00:47:56.958 --> 00:47:59.127
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

729
00:47:59.336 --> 00:48:01.922
How am I ever gonna get her
to kiss me before sunrise?

730
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:03.632
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

731
00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:05.258
Revolution?

732
00:48:05.425 --> 00:48:07.302
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

733
00:48:07.469 --> 00:48:10.180
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

734
00:48:10.347 --> 00:48:12.099
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

735
00:48:12.265 --> 00:48:14.309
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

736
00:48:14.476 --> 00:48:17.479
and you have little mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

737
00:48:17.979 --> 00:48:19.147
I do?!

738
00:48:19.356 --> 00:48:21.483
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

739
00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.610
- [croaks]
- I'm a daddy?

740
00:48:23.777 --> 00:48:27.197
You know what? If I got
Fiona to kiss me once...

741
00:48:29.199 --> 00:48:31.284
...then I can do it again.

742
00:48:31.618 --> 00:48:34.079
[Donkey] Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

743
00:48:34.246 --> 00:48:35.831
[Shrek] Donkey, shh...!

744
00:48:35.997 --> 00:48:37.416
Hello?

745
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:40.043
Fiona?

746
00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:49.094
You should not be here, <i>señor.</i>

747
00:48:49.261 --> 00:48:53.265
- Puss?
- [struggling]

748
00:48:54.307 --> 00:48:57.894
- [gasps]
- You've gotta be kidding me.

749
00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:04.734
Oof! [straining]

750
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.202
Feed me, if you dare.

751
00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:17.664
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

752
00:49:19.082 --> 00:49:22.085
- ...fancy.
- Do I know you?

753
00:49:22.252 --> 00:49:24.838
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

754
00:49:25.005 --> 00:49:29.342
- Your wee little boots?
- Boots? For a cat? Ha!

755
00:49:29.509 --> 00:49:32.637
But you're Puss in Boots.

756
00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.848
Maybe once.

757
00:49:35.015 --> 00:49:36.558
But that is a name I have outgrown.

758
00:49:36.725 --> 00:49:38.351
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

759
00:49:38.518 --> 00:49:42.647
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

760
00:49:42.814 --> 00:49:45.358
but hanging up my sword was
the best decision of my life.

761
00:49:45.525 --> 00:49:48.612
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

762
00:49:49.404 --> 00:49:51.573
Eh, I'll get him later.

763
00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.201
Oh, Puss, what have I done to you?

764
00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:56.411
- You've gone soft.
- [sighs]

765
00:49:56.578 --> 00:50:00.749
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

766
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:03.585
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

767
00:50:03.752 --> 00:50:06.004
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

768
00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:08.048
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

769
00:50:08.215 --> 00:50:09.674
Can I help you with something?

770
00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:12.385
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

771
00:50:12.552 --> 00:50:14.554
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

772
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:18.391
so I brought you a little
something to ease the tension.

773
00:50:18.558 --> 00:50:20.101
A gift basket?

774
00:50:20.268 --> 00:50:22.938
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

775
00:50:23.104 --> 00:50:25.941
Heart-shaped box of slugs. Ooh!

776
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.693
Skunk-scented candle. [sniffs] Mmm.

777
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.114
- Look, this really isn't the...
- Ooh! What's this? Coupons!

778
00:50:33.323 --> 00:50:35.325
Let's see, "Good for
one free foot massage".

779
00:50:35.492 --> 00:50:37.869
"A mud facial!" Oh, and here's one...

780
00:50:38.036 --> 00:50:41.540
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.

781
00:50:41.706 --> 00:50:43.708
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

782
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:45.460
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

783
00:50:45.627 --> 00:50:47.837
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

784
00:50:48.004 --> 00:50:50.090
I suggest you take your gift basket,

785
00:50:50.257 --> 00:50:53.885
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

786
00:50:54.636 --> 00:50:58.974
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

787
00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:02.143
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

788
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.813
An apologetic hug?

789
00:51:05.981 --> 00:51:07.232
And a quick kiss goodbye.

790
00:51:07.399 --> 00:51:10.277
Ow! Hey!

00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:12.612
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

792
00:51:14.364 --> 00:51:17.742
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

793
00:51:17.909 --> 00:51:21.037
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

794
00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:25.417
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

795
00:51:25.584 --> 00:51:28.503
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:30.463

- Fiona's garbage.

Just another gift from
some clueless lover boy.

That's a good one, Cookie!

Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

843
00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:08.371
Works on me.

844
00:54:08.538 --> 00:54:11.332
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

845
00:54:11.541 --> 00:54:12.792
You in trouble, Romeo.

846
00:54:12.959 --> 00:54:14.919
The only thing Fiona
cares about is her cause.

847
00:54:15.086 --> 00:54:17.922
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

What does it look like? I'm
getting ready for ambush action.

855
00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:56.711
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

856
00:54:56.878 --> 00:55:01.049
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

857
00:55:01.216 --> 00:55:04.219
- This one taken?
- We use that to clean the toilets.

858
00:55:04.385 --> 00:55:07.847
- Aah...
- And we use that one to clean the thing

859
00:55:08.014 --> 00:55:10.767
- we clean the toilets with.
- I knew that.

860
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:12.977
There you go, chief.

861
00:55:19.067 --> 00:55:20.151

- My name is Shrek, actually.

864
00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:37.669
You're going to get yourself
killed at the ambush tonight.

865
00:55:37.836 --> 00:55:41.756
I'll be fine. I think
I can take care of myself...

866
00:55:41.923 --> 00:55:43.424
Well, let's see about that.

Fiona?

871
00:56:25.925 --> 00:56:28.803
I got it. Give me your hand.

through the loop and finally...

Wow.

875
00:56:48.698 --> 00:56:53.202
OK. Good.
It seems like you can handle yourself.

876
00:56:53.369 --> 00:56:55.330
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

877
00:56:55.496 --> 00:56:58.499

- That's an order!

Whoo! Just give me a minute.

885
00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:29.364
Look, Puss,
I'm a little pressed for time.

886
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:32.742
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

Back there, you and Fiona.

888
00:57:34.744 --> 00:57:37.372
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

889
00:57:37.538 --> 00:57:39.207
I thought was long extinguished.

890
00:57:39.374 --> 00:57:43.836
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

891
00:57:44.003 --> 00:57:47.715
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

892
00:57:47.882 --> 00:57:49.717
You know of her curse?

- How?
- Convince her!

900
00:58:12.949 --> 00:58:14.409
Go to her when she is alone

901
00:58:14.575 --> 00:58:18.079
and tell her something that
only her true love would know.

902

Get back in position!

I'm gonna fix everything...

OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

920

I can explain everything.

- What's she waiting for?

find out I'm...

I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

932

- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

933
01:00:48.563 --> 01:00:51.190
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

I know that when
you see a shooting star,

935

you cross your fingers on both hands,

and you make a wish.

937

I know that you don't like the
covers wrapped around your feet,

938
01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:04.412
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

939
01:01:04.579 --> 01:01:07.415
because every time
you close your eyes...

940
01:01:07.582 --> 01:01:10.585

wake up back in that tower.

...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

943

never been kissed...

Did you grow up locked away

Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

1012
01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:27.401
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

1013
01:06:27.568 --> 01:06:31.322
- ...shepherd of your dreams.
- [coughing]

1014
01:06:31.489 --> 01:06:34.492
Recently, a certain somebody

1015
01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.995
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

1016
01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:43.918
And that somebody is the
rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

1017
01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:46.337
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

1018
01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:49.048
For whomever brings me this ogre,

1019
01:06:49.215 --> 01:06:53.719
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

1020
01:06:53.886 --> 01:06:55.304
Just think of it! Total and

1021
01:06:55.471 --> 01:06:57.181
- complete happiness.
<i>- Ja</i>!

1022
01:06:57.348 --> 01:07:00.768
Dazzling, radiant fulfillment!
All your greatest wishes.

1023
01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:02.937
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

1024
01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:05.022
Anything you could ever want!

1025
01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:07.858
<i>- No strings attached!</i>
- Oh!

1026
01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:11.111
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

1027
01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:17.451
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

1028
01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:20.663

1029
01:07:24.917 --> 01:07:26.961

It seems that we are safe.

1031
01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:34.760
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

1032
01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:39.056
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

1033
01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:42.142
Look, Shrek, I know things might seem
a little bleak right now,

1034
01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:44.812
but things always work themselves out
in the end, you'll see.

- Don't you understand?

1036

There is no tomorrow.

1037

There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

1038
01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:56.949
My life was perfect and
I'm never going to get it back!

1039
01:07:57.116 --> 01:08:00.744
If your life was so perfect, why'd
you sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

1040
01:08:00.911 --> 01:08:04.290
Because I didn't know what I had
until it was gone! All right?

1041
01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:11.171
I didn't know what I had.

1042
01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:16.677
[yelling] Surrender now!
I'm taking you in!

1043
01:08:16.844 --> 01:08:21.140
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

1044

Gingy?

1045
01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.519

- What are you doing?

01:08:25.686 --> 01:08:26.979
Collecting my bounty!

1047
01:08:27.146 --> 01:08:29.023
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

1048
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:32.359
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

1049
01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:35.571
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

1050

Where all your wishes come true.

1051
01:08:40.451 --> 01:08:42.369
Wait a minute.

1052
01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:45.289
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

1053
01:08:45.456 --> 01:08:47.708
You know what?
I'm gonna give Rumpelstiltskin

1054
01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:52.046
exactly what he wants.
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

[indistinct chattering]

1058

[Rumpelstiltskin] Not Shrek.
That is not Shrek. Also not Shrek.

1059
01:09:03.891 --> 01:09:07.144
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

1060
01:09:07.311 --> 01:09:08.354
- And that...
- Roar.

1061
01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.563
...is just sad.

1062
01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:14.026
- And what is that supposed to be?
- I'm just a frightened old man.

1063
01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:17.154
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

1064

That is your father painted green.

1065
01:09:19.114 --> 01:09:23.702
- No, it's Shrek! Honest!
- [screams] Ow! Take them away!

1066
01:09:23.869 --> 01:09:26.747
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

1067
01:09:26.914 --> 01:09:30.000
How hard can it be?! I want him!
I want him! I want him!

1068
01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:31.585
- [Shrek] Stiltskin!
- [gasps]

1069
01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:37.549
- I hear you're looking for me.
- [cackling] All right! Finally!

1070
01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:41.178
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

1071
01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:43.180
- I do.
- What? But...

1072
01:09:43.347 --> 01:09:47.267
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

1073

[squawks]

1074
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:54.024
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

1075
01:09:54.191 --> 01:09:56.777
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

1076

So if you thought you
were just gonna... [hums]

1077
01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:04.034
- ...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

1078
01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:07.079
Then what do you want?

1079
01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.463
[screeches]

1080
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:22.052
- The ogres. They are all free.
- But where is Shrek?

1081
01:10:27.182 --> 01:10:30.477
This is not good.

1082
01:10:30.644 --> 01:10:34.148
I don't know. Not much
of a storybook ending.

1083

The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

1084

All that matters
is that they're free...

1085

...and Fiona is safe.

1086
01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:50.330

really touched to hear that.

1087

1088
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:55.169

you did, Shrek. Thank you.

No, you were right.

1099

And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

Don't be a fool, mule!

1106
01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:06.990
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

1107
01:12:07.157 --> 01:12:08.784
than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.

1108
01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:10.410
And that cupboard wasn't guarded

1109
01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:13.622
