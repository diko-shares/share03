Yee-haw! Giddyap!

156
00:10:29.437 --> 00:10:30.771
- Ah, Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

157
00:10:30.938 --> 00:10:32.982
Your cake<i>. Voilà</i>!

158
00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:37.111
- Oh, what is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

159
00:10:37.278 --> 00:10:39.655
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

160
00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:42.116
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

161
00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:43.826
I'm in a great mood, actually.

162

- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

165
00:10:50.082 --> 00:10:52.585
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

166
00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:55.296
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

167

You don't want to see me angry, do you?

168
00:10:57.673 --> 00:10:58.966
Do it.

Trust me. It's an improvement.

- Ugh! You licked it!
- No.

doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

It's not like you're a real ogre.
You spent half your life in a palace.

- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

and ogres everywhere!

Trust me, you don't
want to eat this one.

I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

Maybe you missed orientation,
but for future reference,

645
00:43:11.105 --> 00:43:13.232
personal space is very important to me.

646

You don't know who I am, do you?

647
00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:20.155
No. Brogan, I have news
from Far Far Away.

648
00:43:20.322 --> 00:43:22.533
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

649

Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

650
00:43:25.327 --> 00:43:27.329
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

651
00:43:27.496 --> 00:43:32.001
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

652
00:43:32.167 --> 00:43:34.294
...we're married. Hear me out.

653
00:43:34.461 --> 00:43:37.214
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

654
00:43:37.423 --> 00:43:38.799
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

655
00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:41.010
and this boy kept saying, "Do the roar".

656
00:43:41.176 --> 00:43:43.595
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

657
00:43:43.762 --> 00:43:46.098
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

658
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.145
Right? Who's with me?

00:43:51.311 --> 00:43:55.524

harder than I thought.

After tonight, we won't have to.

Some people like to look at

Me, I like to look at it as half full.

We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

But we're not just an empire.

675
00:45:10.057 --> 00:45:12.184
- We're a family.
- Oh!

676
00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:13.685
Everyone has got their cupcake?

00:45:13.852 --> 00:45:16.105
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

678
00:45:16.271 --> 00:45:20.651
Good. Yeah, you know,
we have put away a lot of ogres.

679
00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:25.280
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

680
00:45:25.447 --> 00:45:27.533
It doesn't matter to me.

681
00:45:27.699 --> 00:45:30.452
It's not like it's the end of the world.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:34.540
Except... funny thing.

683
00:45:34.706 --> 00:45:38.210
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

684
00:45:38.377 --> 00:45:41.213
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

685
00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.550
it is the end of the world! Our world!

704

And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

705
00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.233
...then I think I might know
just the person!

706

Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

707
00:46:49.948 --> 00:46:53.118
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

708
00:46:53.285 --> 00:46:54.953
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

709
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.955
- I bet that's because of us.
- Shh!

710
00:46:57.122 --> 00:46:58.874
If that cupcake-eating clown

711
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:02.711
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

712
00:47:02.878 --> 00:47:05.297
- ...he'll be vulnerable.
- The plan's simple.

713
00:47:05.464 --> 00:47:09.801
If they follow the usual patrol route,
they'll reach the river by midnight.

714
00:47:09.968 --> 00:47:13.472
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

715
00:47:13.639 --> 00:47:16.975
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

716
00:47:17.142 --> 00:47:18.977
And then we attack!

717
00:47:24.816 --> 00:47:28.028
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

718
00:47:28.195 --> 00:47:29.947
That's my chimichanga stand.

Um... No, Cookie.
We won't be needing that.

really hungry after this ambush, OK?

Go and finish your little speech.

when the smoke clears,

Rumpelstiltskin is gone and
the chimichangas have been eaten.

About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

Well...

1103
01:11:57.538 --> 01:11:59.164
...you're here now.

1104

Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

1105

Don't be a fool, mule!

1106
01:12:05.379 --> 01:12:07.881
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

1107
01:12:08.048 --> 01:12:09.675
than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.

1108
01:12:09.842 --> 01:12:11.301
And that cupboard wasn't guarded

1109
01:12:11.468 --> 01:12:14.513
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

1110
01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:17.558
Hey! We can hear you!

1111
01:12:18.308 --> 01:12:19.893
Sorry!

1112
01:12:21.311 --> 01:12:23.147
We must get into the palace.

1113
01:12:23.313 --> 01:12:25.441
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

1114
01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:27.151
But how?

1115
01:12:28.402 --> 01:12:31.321
The same way we're gonna bust in.

1116
01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:39.913

Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

1117
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.665
I guess it'll have to do.

1118
01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:51.842
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1119
01:12:52.009 --> 01:12:54.803
The main event of the evening!

1120
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:58.182
I present Shrek and Fiona!

1121
01:13:03.187 --> 01:13:07.274
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

1122
01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:11.195
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

1123
