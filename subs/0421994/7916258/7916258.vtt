( screaming in excitement )

7
00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:29.480
WOMAN: I want something that
says I'm sorry he's dead,

8
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.048
but not that sorry.

9
00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.616
He was just a dog,

10
00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:35.219
and you shouldn't have
loved him more than me.

11
00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.022
Can you do me a bunch
that says that?

12
00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:40.691
( Sighs )

13
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:41.992
Rachel, darling,

14
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.760
tell your father he
can't wear that suit.

15
00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.429
RACHEL: He looks nice.

16
00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:47.831
You look nice.

17
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:49.032
Thank you, puppet.

18
00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:50.501
I've seen better-dressed crab.

19
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:52.670
I have a question. Oh,
God, would somebody please

20
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.338
put a gag on my daughter?

21
00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:56.274
Why's the alphabet
in that order?

22
00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:57.675
Nobody knows. Nobody cares.

23
00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.578
For once in your life
would you just...

24
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.914
What do you think?

25
00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:06.484
Holy wow.

26
00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:08.051
Oh, darling.

27
00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:09.953
You look like meringue.

28
00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:12.656
Good.

29
00:02:12.756 --> 00:02:14.825
You're late.

30
00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:16.327
Balls. What's the job?

31
00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:18.205
Wedding. You always pull.

32
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.063
One of us has to. Nice people?

33
00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:22.466
Haven't met them. All
about the mother.

34
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.367
Isn't it always?

35
00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.303
Come out with us first? Sure.

36
00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:27.471
You will? Absolutely.

37
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:28.672
Oh, cool.

38
00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:30.274
Well, we'll go together.

39
00:02:30.374 --> 00:02:31.942
I'll meet you there.

40
00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.211
You're not coming.

41
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:34.745
My favorite advert's on TV.

42
00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:35.913
You need a love life.

43
00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:38.349
I have a like life.
It suits me fine.

44
00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.351
No, I feel good, actually.

45
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.785
Bizarrely good, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:42.786
No nerves at all.

47
00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:43.887
None whatsoever. Thanks.

48
00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:45.022
Thank you very much. Hi.

49
00:02:45.122 --> 00:02:46.290
Thank you. Hi.

50
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.825
You're Hector, right? The groom?

51
00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:49.927
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call me Heck.

52
00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.962
Um, well, I did your flowers.

53
00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:53.764
Oh, did you? Oh, well,
then, then fabulous.

54
00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:54.864
Aren't they, Coop?

55
00:02:54.898 --> 00:02:56.434
Fabulous, yeah.

56
00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:59.403
I wouldn't know a nice flower
from a poke in the eye.

57
00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:01.505
But they're fabulous,
aren't they, Coop?

58
00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:06.577
So, Ned, how long have you
guys been married, then?

59
00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:08.746
30 years. Oh.

60
00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:09.913
If I had killed her

61
00:03:10.013 --> 00:03:11.213
when I first thought about it,

62
00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.516
I could be out by now.

63
00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.585
A free man.

64
00:03:15.753 --> 00:03:17.388
I remember all the
way to the church,

65
00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:21.124
I just wanted to
shout "Stop the car!

66
00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.362
This is a horrible mistake!"

67
00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:27.698
But I mean, you can't, can you?

68
00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:30.934
So you just sit there,

69
00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:32.135
say nothing,

70
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.772
as the wheels keep turning,

71
00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:36.907
leading you on to the
longest sentence...

72
00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:38.609
Stop the car!

73
00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.943
I forgot to pee.

74
00:03:49.553 --> 00:03:51.154
All right, panic over.

75
00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:52.290
They're here now.

76
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.624
Good luck, chum.

77
00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:55.759
All right, is it?
You're all right.

78
00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.094
Hi, Heck. Hi, babe.

79
00:03:57.194 --> 00:03:58.562
LUCE: You want some
help with this?

80
00:03:58.662 --> 00:03:59.830
Yes.

81
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.832
I do work out, yes.

82
00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:03.601
I don't have a six-pack.

83
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:04.402
No?

84
00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:06.670
No, a 12-pack on this puppy.

85
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.639
I don't really like
men with muscles.

86
00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.841
The bonus is, though,
I'm very, uh...

87
00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:12.576
I'm very sensitive, too.

88
00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:14.978
Heck, I've got a question.
Not now.

89
00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:16.614
What's the question?

90
00:04:16.714 --> 00:04:18.325
What happens when an
unstoppable force

91
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.318
meets an immovable object?

92
00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.021
I haven't got a blasted clue.

93
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:26.757
There you are, you see? Now we can
let them get married in peace.

94
00:04:26.857 --> 00:04:28.368
Uh, it never happens.

95
00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.992
If there's a thing
that can't be stopped,

96
00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:32.062
it's not possible for there
to be something else

97
00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:34.865
which can't be moved,
and vice versa.

98
00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:36.133
They can't both exist.

99
00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:38.378
You see, it's a trick question.

100
00:04:38.402 --> 00:04:39.437
That's the answer.

101
00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:41.839
Can she sit with me?

102
00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:44.342
What am I doing in here?

103
00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:45.909
When do fish sleep?

104
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.112

105
00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:50.548
( indistinct chatter )

106
00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:52.149
HECK: She's coming, right?
Isn't she?

107
00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.117
She's coming.

108
00:04:54.217 --> 00:04:56.720
Oh, she is. Yeah.

109
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:59.823
When, when's she coming?

110
00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:01.191
What's your name, anyway?

111
00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:02.526
Everyone calls me H.

112
00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:04.227
They tell me it's
short for Henrietta,

113
00:05:04.362 --> 00:05:05.529
but it's not.

114
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.498
It's short for Jesus H. Christ.

115
00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:08.766
That's what my mummy said

116
00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:10.586
when she found out she
was pregnant with me.

117
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.070
Isn't Heck handsome?

118
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.638
I fancy that flower girl.

119
00:05:14.738 --> 00:05:16.407
Yeah, yeah, I know you did.

120
00:05:16.507 --> 00:05:17.808
She likes me.

121
00:05:17.908 --> 00:05:20.844
Right? I got, I got a
vibe that she likes me.

122
00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:22.245
Coop, it's my wedding day.

123
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.514
Can we talk about me?

124
00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:25.082
Sure.

125
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.390
( Whispering ): Did you get
a vibe that she likes me?

126
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.394
( Muted organ music playing )

127
00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:39.430
Great.

128
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.899
Last one to the
altar, as they say.

129
00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:48.005
Well, this is it.

130
00:05:48.105 --> 00:05:49.907
Wish me luck.

131
00:05:50.007 --> 00:05:51.475
Wish you luck?

132
00:05:51.575 --> 00:05:52.676
It's a wedding.

133
00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.745
Bridesmaids always
pull at weddings.

134
00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:55.846
Wish me luck.

135
00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:57.080
Good luck.

136

Okay, you sort it.

139

149

look beautiful.

00:08:23.727 --> 00:08:25.829
Off and in there.

188
00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:27.464
My wedding ring is in there.

189
00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:29.399
And you tried the ladle?

190
00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:30.601
Nothing.

191
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:32.870
And you can't empty it, no.
Stupid.

192
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.437
Um... right.

193
00:08:34.572 --> 00:08:36.239
Only one thing to do.

194
00:08:36.339 --> 00:08:37.675
Cover me. What?

195
00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:39.242
Use the dress. I'm going in.

196

They say white's the
color of virgins.

the best, aren't they?

underneath me,

I've just met a cracking filly.

00:09:04.702 --> 00:09:06.870
Thought I'd grease the
passage, so to speak.

Some say the reason it's taken
him this long to get married,

is his fear of making just this
speech, but he's making it now.

and I know I'll know him
for the rest of it.

He's my best friend.

305
00:13:20.858 --> 00:13:24.862
They say fairy tales
have happy endings,

even though the
passage can be rough.

307
00:13:26.864 --> 00:13:31.168
But Heck and I were
mates and then lovers,

308
00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:35.873
and it's been
smooth all the way.

309
00:13:35.973 --> 00:13:39.742
Maybe that's a better
kind of fairy tale.

310
00:13:39.877 --> 00:13:42.880
So a toast shmoast
won't do all that,

311
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.500
but if you could all
just wish us luck,

312
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:46.884
Heck and I would
appreciate it very much.

313

Hello.

Only the right
flower can save me.

326
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.664
What about a rose? A red rose.

327
00:14:34.764 --> 00:14:36.533
What would that say? Love.

328
00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:37.633
Love's nice. That works.

329
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.700
And fidelity.

330
00:14:38.768 --> 00:14:40.737
Not a red rose, then.

331
00:14:40.837 --> 00:14:42.397
No, not a rose at all.
It's too obvious.

332

your last chance,

What's out here?

341
00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:02.559

Okay, stop talking.

My last chance flower.

368
00:15:53.176 --> 00:15:56.013
Wish me luck. Good luck.

369
00:15:57.747 --> 00:15:59.916
MAN: Next item: lot 48:

370
00:16:00.017 --> 00:16:02.519
a 1930s American
oak mantle clock

371
00:16:02.619 --> 00:16:04.621
here at 48 pounds.

372
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:05.788
I have 48 pounds.

373
00:16:05.888 --> 00:16:07.066
Fifty.

374
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.192
The lady bid 50.
The lady bid 50.

375
00:16:09.292 --> 00:16:10.693
Okay, baby, now
you've got to glare.

376
00:16:10.793 --> 00:16:12.229
Give out the red eye.

377
00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:14.164
I'd do it, but you're a
lot more frightening.

378
00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.699
No, I'm not. Who
am I glaring at?

379
00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:18.068
Anyone who wants that sofa.

380
00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:19.602
They can't have it. It's mine.

381
00:16:19.702 --> 00:16:21.204
Ours. Ours?

382
00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:22.905
If it's under the
limit, 200 pounds.

383
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.307
I didn't know we need a limit.

384
00:16:24.407 --> 00:16:26.476
I like limits. Otherwise,
you'll go mad.

385
00:16:26.576 --> 00:16:28.178
Damn right I will.
That thing is mine.

386
00:16:28.278 --> 00:16:29.579
( Bell rings ) Ours.

387
00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:32.682
( Whispers ): If it's
under the limit.

388
00:16:32.782 --> 00:16:35.585
75 pounds? 75?

389
00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:39.098
I invited somebody to dinner,
Friday, that florist, Luce...

390
00:16:39.122 --> 00:16:40.357
Lucy, whatever.

391
00:16:40.457 --> 00:16:42.292
Oh, great, I'll cook.
Please, don't.

392
00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:43.872
Moving right along.
Lot number nine...

393
00:16:43.896 --> 00:16:45.228
Okay, baby, this is us.

394
00:16:45.328 --> 00:16:48.098
This very attractive
leather sofa over there.

395
00:16:48.198 --> 00:16:49.732
Brown leather Chesterfield.

396
00:16:49.832 --> 00:16:51.168
Brass-style decoration

397
00:16:51.268 --> 00:16:53.870
in slightly distressed
condition at 90 pounds.

398
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:54.970
I asked because...

399
00:16:55.072 --> 00:16:56.339
This is my plan. Oh, no.

400
00:16:56.439 --> 00:16:57.774
I thought we'd get Coop along.

401
00:16:57.874 --> 00:16:59.109
Great idea. Excellent,

402
00:16:59.209 --> 00:17:00.969
but it would be better
if you didn't do that.

403
00:17:00.993 --> 00:17:02.479
90... Do I hear 90 pounds?

404
00:17:02.579 --> 00:17:03.946
Not from us.

405
00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:05.721
Come in late, psyche
them all the way out.

406
00:17:05.748 --> 00:17:07.450
I think they'd be
perfect for each other.

407
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.870
Don't you think
they'd be perfect?

408
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:10.129
100, 100 pounds?

409
00:17:10.153 --> 00:17:11.821
110, thank you.

410
00:17:11.921 --> 00:17:13.490
Red eye, still the red eye.

411
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:15.725
Who? Luce and Cooper. I
think they'd be perfect.

412
00:17:15.825 --> 00:17:17.794
120.

413
00:17:17.894 --> 00:17:19.129
130, thank you.

414
00:17:19.229 --> 00:17:21.564
He did say he was on to a
promise at the wedding

415
00:17:21.664 --> 00:17:22.699
before she bailed.

416
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:23.700
There you go. It's totally on.

417
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.235
150 at the back.

418
00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:26.169
Okay.

419
00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:27.804
Any more? It's funny.

420
00:17:27.904 --> 00:17:29.172
I went round to say thank you

421
00:17:29.272 --> 00:17:30.907
for what she did at our wedding.

422
00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:32.775
Not yet.

423
00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:35.545
You know when you've just met
someone, but straightaway,

424
00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:37.780
you feel as if they're
going to be your friend?

425
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.125
170? 180?

426
00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:40.583
Nearly there.

427
00:17:40.683 --> 00:17:42.128
Who knows why.

428
00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:44.020
Past life, physiognomy.

429
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:47.624
190? But for some reason,
you just kind of click.

430
00:17:47.724 --> 00:17:48.825
Here we go.

431
00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:49.925
210?

432
00:17:49.992 --> 00:17:52.262
210?

433
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.164
Bollocks. I don't
know what I'm saying,

434
00:17:54.264 --> 00:17:55.832
but do you know what I mean?

435
00:17:55.932 --> 00:17:58.768
Baby, we lost it... the sofa.

436
00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:00.002
What?

437
00:18:00.137 --> 00:18:01.904
210 pounds... Over our limit.

438
00:18:02.004 --> 00:18:04.507
400.

439
00:18:04.607 --> 00:18:06.243
400?

440
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:22.325
What are you doing?

441
00:18:22.425 --> 00:18:24.170
I live here. What are you doing?

442
00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:26.996
I came to tidy.

443
00:18:27.164 --> 00:18:28.398
You should be dressed, Mum.

444
00:18:28.498 --> 00:18:29.332
Well, I was.

445
00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:32.001
I'm settling in for the evening.

446
00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:33.336
It's 5:00.

447
00:18:33.436 --> 00:18:36.206
You said you were
going out later.

448
00:18:36.306 --> 00:18:38.575
No, you said I was
going out later.

449
00:18:38.675 --> 00:18:40.577
Have you finished work

450
00:18:40.677 --> 00:18:41.878
already?

451
00:18:41.978 --> 00:18:42.978
I'm busy tonight.

452
00:18:43.045 --> 00:18:45.315
Got a date?

453
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:46.816
Does my daughter have a date?

454
00:18:46.916 --> 00:18:49.018
No,

455
00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:51.721
but you could have.

456
00:18:56.926 --> 00:18:59.061
Oh, tea dances.

457
00:18:59.196 --> 00:19:00.330
Reading groups.

458
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.033
Bridge clubs. Tragic attempts

459
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:07.337
by lonely old coffin-dodgers
to meet someone

460
00:19:07.437 --> 00:19:09.239
before they give up and peg out.

461
00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:12.409
Everybody looking for love.

462
00:19:12.509 --> 00:19:13.876
Well, they won't find it.

463
00:19:13.976 --> 00:19:15.256
And they certainly
won't get sex.

464
00:19:15.345 --> 00:19:16.979
All those men are so old,

465
00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:18.948
it'd be like playing
snooker with a rope.

466
00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:21.318
( Chuckles )

467
00:19:21.418 --> 00:19:23.220
You know those people are sad.

468
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.231
You're sad. No.

469
00:19:25.255 --> 00:19:26.923
I'm depressed.

470
00:19:27.023 --> 00:19:28.023
There's a difference.

471
00:19:28.057 --> 00:19:30.860
I wish you'd get a life.

472
00:19:32.362 --> 00:19:34.897
I wish you would.

473
00:19:34.997 --> 00:19:37.634
Yes, I know you do.

474
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.280
Toby, I'm telling you
that's the number!

475
00:19:41.304 --> 00:19:42.505
You've got to believe me.

476
00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:44.374
Oh, come on, Toby. Don't
play that with me.

477
00:19:44.474 --> 00:19:46.075
We're friends.
Aren't we friends?

478
00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:47.510
Well, I like you.

479
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.846
Look, would you believe
it if Heck told you?

480
00:19:49.946 --> 00:19:51.248
You would?

481
00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:53.450
Thank you very much.

482
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.485
Hey, Toby.

483
00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:59.256
Yeah, I know, weird,
but believe him, okay?

484
00:19:59.356 --> 00:20:01.724
Okay, speak soon.

485
00:20:01.824 --> 00:20:03.460
All good.

486
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.363
You see, the truth never fails.

487
00:20:06.463 --> 00:20:09.366
Yeah, except we were lying.

488
00:20:11.568 --> 00:20:12.869
Hmm.

489
00:20:15.338 --> 00:20:19.276
Oh, sorry I'm late,
beautiful person.

490
00:20:19.376 --> 00:20:20.610
You look spectacular.

491
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.178
How was work?

492
00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:24.414
Shite. I'm quitting.

493
00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:26.416
You always say that.

494
00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.685
Just watch me. One
day I'll do it.

495
00:20:28.785 --> 00:20:31.888
Tell them I don't like
them or their cash.

496
00:20:31.988 --> 00:20:33.690
Although I do like their cash.

497
00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:34.857
Whatever.

498
00:20:34.957 --> 00:20:37.560
A little something to walk out.

499
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.030
I'll be waiting with champagne.

500
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.433
How much do I wish it
was just us tonight.

501
00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.468
He'll definitely be
into her, right?

502
00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:47.304
Coop? He'll fancy Luce.

503
00:20:47.404 --> 00:20:48.838
She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

504
00:20:48.938 --> 00:20:51.140
No, but I mean, you do.

505
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.609
You would?

506
00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:55.177
Well, she's not really my
bag of chips, darling,

507
00:20:55.278 --> 00:20:57.447
but yeah, I suppose.

508
00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.849
Oh, what do you think?

509
00:20:59.949 --> 00:21:02.151
Of her? I haven't really.

510
00:21:02.251 --> 00:21:04.120
No, no, the shirt.

511
00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:07.223
Oh, uh, it's gorgeous.

512
00:21:07.324 --> 00:21:08.791
You're gorgeous.

513
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:10.126
Yeah?

514
00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:12.194
Want to, uh, fool around?

515
00:21:12.329 --> 00:21:14.163
( Doorbell rings )
Saved by the bell,

516
00:21:14.331 --> 00:21:17.434
but you're in a lot
of trouble later.

517
00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:22.138
Hey. Hey.

518
00:21:22.238 --> 00:21:23.238
Come in.

519
00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.074
You look fab. Thank you.

520
00:21:25.174 --> 00:21:26.175
Guess what I brought.

521
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320
Bless you.

522
00:21:27.344 --> 00:21:28.210
Rach will flip.

523
00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:29.388
Sweetheart.

524
00:21:29.412 --> 00:21:31.681
Here I am.

525
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:34.083
Hey. Hi.

526
00:21:34.183 --> 00:21:36.986
So come check out our new sofa.

527
00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:38.154
Our expensive new sofa.

528
00:21:38.254 --> 00:21:39.534
You can't put a
price on comfort.

529
00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.358
You see? Woman after
my own heart.

530
00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:42.959
Do you believe in reincarnation?

531
00:21:43.059 --> 00:21:45.099
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

532
00:21:45.123 --> 00:21:47.897
That's not quite what I...

533
00:21:47.997 --> 00:21:51.133
I'd have remembered, I think.

534
00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:52.433
Well, let's hang these flowers

535
00:21:52.469 --> 00:21:54.036
and get that jacket
in some water.

536
00:21:54.136 --> 00:21:55.872
I'll do it. Ta.

537
00:21:57.206 --> 00:21:58.808
Thanks. Thank you, darling.

538
00:21:58.908 --> 00:22:01.387
HECK: So, basically, the
book I've wanted to write

539
00:22:01.411 --> 00:22:03.846
is a guide to wherever
is the coolest place

540
00:22:03.946 --> 00:22:05.515
on the planet at the time.

541
00:22:05.615 --> 00:22:08.284
If it's February, it's
the Rio Carnival,

542
00:22:08.385 --> 00:22:10.987
and if it's, I don't know, May,

543
00:22:11.087 --> 00:22:12.254
it's bulls in Pamplona.

544
00:22:12.389 --> 00:22:15.758
So if you want a holiday/party,

545
00:22:15.858 --> 00:22:17.727
then, uh, you know,
you open the book

546
00:22:17.827 --> 00:22:19.896
and there's me telling
you where to go.

547
00:22:19.996 --> 00:22:21.230
'Cause you've been there?

548
00:22:21.398 --> 00:22:25.101
Yeah, that was the plan,
but, uh, you know...

549
00:22:25.201 --> 00:22:28.270
Rach, life, work.

550
00:22:28.405 --> 00:22:30.006
Rach.

551
00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:31.106
Well, someday.

552
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.475
Yeah, maybe.

553
00:22:34.176 --> 00:22:37.246
Anyway, how about you? Married?

554
00:22:37.414 --> 00:22:39.014
Ever been married?
Ever gonna be married?

555
00:22:39.038 --> 00:22:42.251
Uh, no, no, and maybe now
the laws have changed.

556
00:22:42.419 --> 00:22:43.886
How do you mean? I'm gay.

557
00:22:43.986 --> 00:22:47.123
( Chuckles )

558
00:22:47.223 --> 00:22:49.025
Hmm.

559
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.292
Lovely.

560
00:22:50.427 --> 00:22:51.528
Well done.

561
00:22:51.628 --> 00:22:53.663
( Doorbell rings )

562
00:22:56.866 --> 00:22:58.968
That'll be Cooper.

563
00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:00.670
Cooper's coming?

564
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.972
Yeah.

565
00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:10.112
Mm.

566
00:23:10.212 --> 00:23:11.213
Heck?

567
00:23:11.448 --> 00:23:12.214
Hmm?

568
00:23:12.314 --> 00:23:13.474
This is absolutely revolting.

569
00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.851
You think so?

570
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:16.586
It is, sweetheart.
It's atrocious.

571
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.456
Anyway, more
importantly, listen,

572
00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:21.658
it's been three weeks now.
Let's have it.

573
00:23:21.758 --> 00:23:23.292
How much better is
sex after marriage?

574
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.661
Please.

575
00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:26.629
Because when I've
had sex with people

576
00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:28.130
after they were married,

577
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.590
they have said that
it's fantastic.

578
00:23:29.614 --> 00:23:30.299
Rach?

579
00:23:30.467 --> 00:23:32.334
Get wed and find out yourself.

580
00:23:32.469 --> 00:23:34.149
HECK: Cooper couldn't
make that commitment.

581
00:23:34.249 --> 00:23:35.927
We're talking about two or
three years of his life.

582
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:37.339
I'm not a one-person person.

583
00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:39.274
You really think your
other half is out there?

584
00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:41.544
Or, you know, in here?
Actually, Rach...

585
00:23:41.644 --> 00:23:43.244
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

586
00:23:43.268 --> 00:23:44.514
COOPER: Yes, there are.

587
00:23:44.614 --> 00:23:46.549
And I'm trying to sleep
with as many as I can.

588
00:23:46.649 --> 00:23:47.950
And you never fail, do you?

589
00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.821
You know they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

590
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:54.557
It'll all change when
you meet Miss Right.

591
00:23:54.657 --> 00:23:56.577
And how am I suppose to
know when I do that? Hmm?

592
00:23:56.626 --> 00:23:58.828
You don't know,
not straightaway.

593
00:23:58.928 --> 00:24:02.364
It just feels warm

594
00:24:02.499 --> 00:24:03.633
and comfortable

595
00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:05.544
and you hang in there
and give it a chance.

596
00:24:05.568 --> 00:24:06.569
Before you know it,

597
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:09.872
you're like, yeah, this is it.

598
00:24:09.972 --> 00:24:11.240
Must be love.

599
00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.142
Yeah, I'm with you.
I'm with her, too.

600
00:24:13.242 --> 00:24:14.711
Give me that.

601
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:17.647
I don't agree. I think
you know immediately.

602
00:24:17.747 --> 00:24:21.050
As soon as your eyes...

603
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.020
Then everything that happens
from then on just proves

604
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.656
that you had been right
in that first moment.

605
00:24:26.756 --> 00:24:28.756
When you suddenly realized
you had been incomplete,

606
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.248
and now you are whole.

607
00:24:31.794 --> 00:24:33.930
Actually, I'm with her instead.

608
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.164
I'm with her, too.

609
00:24:35.264 --> 00:24:36.933
Sordid. So who's for pudding?

610
00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:38.434
Yes. No.

611
00:24:38.535 --> 00:24:40.870
No? No, if you think that,

612
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.772
you think that everyone
that doesn't have

613
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:46.643
all that business is
settling for less...

614
00:24:46.743 --> 00:24:48.277
No, that's not what I'm saying.

615
00:24:48.377 --> 00:24:49.737
That kind of is
what you're saying.

616
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:51.180
I think she said it a bit nicer.

617
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.584
Trifle?

618
00:24:54.684 --> 00:24:56.418
You look tired, Chief.

619
00:24:56.553 --> 00:24:58.120
You have a good day at work?

620
00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.355
Shite. I'm quitting.

621
00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:01.123
Did you check out
flower girl back there?

622
00:25:01.223 --> 00:25:02.725
Made that speech for me.

623
00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:04.827
Later on tonight, we're
going to fall madly in bed.

624
00:25:04.927 --> 00:25:06.629
Oh, it's going well
for you guys, eh?

625
00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:10.567
It's going very well. Hmm.

626
00:25:10.667 --> 00:25:12.201
She's a lesbian.

627
00:25:13.402 --> 00:25:15.705
Is that right?

628
00:25:15.805 --> 00:25:17.439
Cool.

629
00:25:17.574 --> 00:25:19.014
You don't think that
slightly impedes

630
00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:21.210
your plans for seduction?

631
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.580
Anyone can change teams.

632
00:25:24.714 --> 00:25:26.148
Not anyone. I wouldn't,

633
00:25:26.248 --> 00:25:30.119
'cause, well, you know,
but anyone, I mean...

634
00:25:40.663 --> 00:25:42.732
What are you doing?

635
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.935
It's gorgeous!

636
00:25:46.035 --> 00:25:48.004
It's raining.

637
00:25:50.372 --> 00:25:52.408
Heck won't come up here.

638
00:25:52.508 --> 00:25:55.612
They say it's a subconscious
fear you'll throw yourself off,

639
00:25:55.712 --> 00:26:00.116
but he freaks when I
go near the edge, too.

640
00:26:00.216 --> 00:26:02.051
Sorry about dinner.

641
00:26:03.252 --> 00:26:05.054
I've eaten worse.

642
00:26:07.456 --> 00:26:08.991
I kind of went off.

643
00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:11.637
You didn't go off.

644
00:26:11.661 --> 00:26:14.797
Hmm, you went a little way off.

645
00:26:17.266 --> 00:26:18.266
You're wet.

646
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.300
I'm fine.

647
00:26:19.368 --> 00:26:20.368
And you're cold.

648
00:26:20.402 --> 00:26:22.038
I'm fine.

649
00:26:22.138 --> 00:26:24.218
You can have it. Really, you can have it.
I'm so fine.

650
00:26:24.242 --> 00:26:25.341
It's fine. Now you're cold.

651
00:26:25.441 --> 00:26:27.243
HECK: Hey, what are
you guys up to?

652
00:26:27.343 --> 00:26:28.510
Nothing.

653
00:26:28.645 --> 00:26:30.546
Well, Coop wants to
play strip poker

654
00:26:30.647 --> 00:26:31.781
or strip Cooper,

655
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:34.183
and I really want
him to go home.

656
00:26:34.283 --> 00:26:35.184
Good night.

657
00:26:35.284 --> 00:26:36.185
See you soon.

658
00:26:36.285 --> 00:26:37.386
One... oh, two.

659
00:26:37.486 --> 00:26:38.387
Thanks for dinner.

660
00:26:38.487 --> 00:26:39.822
Bye.

661
00:26:41.758 --> 00:26:43.960
Cheers, Coop.

662
00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:51.100
LUCE: Next left.

663
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.120
COOPER: That's one option, yes.
How about instead,

664
00:26:53.169 --> 00:26:55.404
we just go straight
back to my place?

665
00:26:55.504 --> 00:26:57.206
Coop, take the next left.

666
00:26:57.306 --> 00:26:59.842
You all right, Luce?

667
00:26:59.942 --> 00:27:01.711
Why, because I don't
want to shag you?

668
00:27:01.811 --> 00:27:04.080
You're welcome not to shag me.

669
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.550
Just don't sit in my car
all bored like that. Hmm?

670
00:27:08.685 --> 00:27:12.288
I'm sorry.

671
00:27:12.388 --> 00:27:13.890
Really.

672
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.327
You got something on your
mind; that's obvious.

673
00:27:18.427 --> 00:27:20.763
You know what you should do?

674
00:27:20.863 --> 00:27:23.733
You should share with me.

675
00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:26.535
Because beneath this
rugged exterior

676
00:27:26.703 --> 00:27:29.038
beats a sensitive soul.

677
00:27:29.138 --> 00:27:30.539
No, there doesn't.

678
00:27:30.707 --> 00:27:32.842
No, there doesn't,
but tell me anyway.

679
00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:35.311
It's a girl thing,
though, right?

680
00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:37.313
I mean, it's got to be.

681
00:27:37.413 --> 00:27:38.881
It's a hot and horny scene.

682
00:27:38.981 --> 00:27:42.318
It's you and another
Sagittarian.

683
00:27:42.418 --> 00:27:43.729
Come on.

684
00:27:43.753 --> 00:27:45.254
Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.

685
00:27:45.354 --> 00:27:46.522
Spare me no detail.

686
00:27:46.622 --> 00:27:51.193
Have you ever... met
someone and just...

687
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.098
but they're with
someone else already?

688
00:27:56.198 --> 00:27:57.599
Yeah, sure.

689
00:27:57.734 --> 00:27:59.301
The hot ones are always taken.

690
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:00.401
So what do you do?

691
00:28:00.436 --> 00:28:01.938
What do I do?

692
00:28:04.206 --> 00:28:05.341
I shag 'em.

693
00:28:05.441 --> 00:28:07.509
The partner is their problem.

694
00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:08.878
It's not mine.

695
00:28:11.213 --> 00:28:13.816
Yeah, I think you don't
mess with other couples.

696
00:28:13.916 --> 00:28:16.652
Don't cause that pain ever.

697
00:28:16.753 --> 00:28:19.621
You just face facts
that it can't happen.

698
00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:21.357
Walk away.

699
00:28:21.457 --> 00:28:22.759
Hook up

700
00:28:22.859 --> 00:28:24.099
with someone available instead.

701
00:28:24.123 --> 00:28:25.762
Well, your place or mine?

702
00:28:25.862 --> 00:28:26.763
Come on, let's.

703
00:28:26.863 --> 00:28:28.865
I'm so good in bed.

704
00:28:30.566 --> 00:28:31.810
So you promise me

705
00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:33.669
the whole matchmaking
thing is over, right?

706
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.604
Last night was a big success.

707
00:28:35.772 --> 00:28:37.039
They left together.

708
00:28:37.139 --> 00:28:40.609
That distant sound you
hear is wedding bells.

709
00:28:40.777 --> 00:28:42.011
Wait, you didn't twig?

710
00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:44.613
Oh, damn, you're so uncool.

711
00:28:44.781 --> 00:28:46.048
What? Twig what?

712
00:28:46.148 --> 00:28:47.748
Well, the thing you
don't know about Luce

713
00:28:47.784 --> 00:28:48.785
is the fact that she's...

714
00:28:48.885 --> 00:28:51.087
Right here. Hey, hey.

715
00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:52.989
Hey, hi. Hello.

716
00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:54.929
Weirdest thing. We were
just talking about you.

717
00:28:54.957 --> 00:28:57.526
Oh, all nice, I hope.

718
00:28:57.626 --> 00:29:00.296
Oh, sorry, Heck. This is Edie.

719
00:29:00.396 --> 00:29:01.697
Edie. Heck.

720
00:29:01.798 --> 00:29:03.065
And Rachel.

721
00:29:03.165 --> 00:29:04.233
Rachel.

722
00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:05.534
Edie.

723
00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:07.636
Luce?

724
00:29:07.781 --> 00:29:08.781
Good.

725
00:29:08.805 --> 00:29:10.406
So, um... Saturday shopping?

726
00:29:10.506 --> 00:29:11.607
Is right.

727
00:29:11.808 --> 00:29:12.809
Great.

728
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:14.977
Enjoy it, and listen,
thanks for dinner.

729
00:29:15.077 --> 00:29:16.578
We should definitely...

730
00:29:16.678 --> 00:29:17.847
Definitely. We will.

731
00:29:17.947 --> 00:29:20.549
Okay, well, have a
nice rest of shop.

732
00:29:20.649 --> 00:29:22.051
You, too.

733
00:29:24.153 --> 00:29:26.434
So you're going tonight? Because
I was thinking maybe I...

734
00:29:26.488 --> 00:29:27.623
Whoa, pussycat.

735
00:29:27.723 --> 00:29:29.725
What the hell was
going on there?

736
00:29:29.826 --> 00:29:31.327
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

737
00:29:31.427 --> 00:29:32.929
Luce is gay.

738
00:29:35.264 --> 00:29:36.365
She's gay?

739
00:29:36.465 --> 00:29:37.876
As a tennis player.

740
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.701
Hey, you recognize
the girlfriend?

741
00:29:39.836 --> 00:29:42.038
She's not just heterosexual.

742
00:29:42.138 --> 00:29:44.974
She's, like, Barbie
heterosexual.

743
00:29:45.074 --> 00:29:46.943
Whoa-whoa, hey! How
are you doing?

744
00:29:47.043 --> 00:29:48.854
We were just talking
about you this time.

745
00:29:48.878 --> 00:29:50.913
We'll be late for kickoff.
Oh, there's hours yet.

746
00:29:51.013 --> 00:29:52.333
We support the same
football team.

747
00:29:52.381 --> 00:29:54.616
Oh, how darling.
Isn't that darling?

748
00:29:54.716 --> 00:29:55.918
Good. Well, hope you win.

749
00:29:56.018 --> 00:29:57.519
Edie, are you gay?

750
00:29:57.619 --> 00:29:58.620
Oh, God.

751
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:01.523
Am I gay?

752
00:30:01.623 --> 00:30:02.868
I'm ecstatic.

753
00:30:02.892 --> 00:30:04.193
And you two...? No, no.

754
00:30:04.293 --> 00:30:07.363
We're not. I've
tried and I tried,

755
00:30:07.463 --> 00:30:08.497
but she loves another.

756
00:30:08.597 --> 00:30:10.499
Huh. So I'll call you.

757
00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:12.010
Do, 'cause we should definitely.
Definitely.

758
00:30:12.034 --> 00:30:13.235
We will. We're going that way.

759
00:30:13.335 --> 00:30:14.236
Yep, bye again.

760
00:30:14.336 --> 00:30:16.906
Bye.

761
00:30:19.008 --> 00:30:22.244
So I found out they
are not an item.

762
00:30:22.344 --> 00:30:24.813
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.

763
00:30:25.747 --> 00:30:27.283
Hi!

764
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:29.361
Are you stalking us?

765
00:30:29.385 --> 00:30:31.187
And why would we do
a thing like that?

766
00:30:31.287 --> 00:30:33.322
We'll be at this till... Waving.

767
00:30:33.422 --> 00:30:34.422
We'll wave back.

768
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.225
And do. Oh, we must.

769
00:30:36.325 --> 00:30:38.160
Definitely.

00:30:41.263 --> 00:30:44.166

Can you hand me the

779
00:31:16.465 --> 00:31:17.465
Hmm.

780
00:31:17.499 --> 00:31:19.268
I like this jam.

781
00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:23.705
It's really good jam.

782
00:31:23.805 --> 00:31:25.107
I should make jam.

783
00:31:25.207 --> 00:31:26.642
I could make it, you know.

784
00:31:26.742 --> 00:31:29.345
Of course you could.

785
00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:31.513
You don't think I could.

786
00:31:31.613 --> 00:31:32.814
Not for a second.

787
00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:34.960
Anyway, I was talking
to Rob yesterday.

788
00:31:34.984 --> 00:31:36.385
That man's an arse.

789
00:31:36.485 --> 00:31:37.954
That man is an arse.

790
00:31:38.054 --> 00:31:39.755
But he's got this really
sweet girlfriend.

791
00:31:39.855 --> 00:31:42.324
God knows what she's found to
love about him, but she does.

792
00:31:42.424 --> 00:31:44.961
And he cheats on
her like a nutter.

793
00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.429
Oh, come back to bed.

794
00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:49.298
I'm up now.

795
00:31:49.398 --> 00:31:50.532
Does she know?

796
00:31:50.632 --> 00:31:53.235
Well, I'm like, "If you
want to leave, tell her."

797
00:31:54.803 --> 00:31:56.405
Are you really up?

798
00:31:56.505 --> 00:31:58.174
I really am.

799
00:31:58.274 --> 00:32:01.410
Maybe he doesn't want to leave.

800
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.179
Maybe he doesn't
know what he wants.

801
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:05.681
Anyway, he should figure it
out before someone gets hurt.

802
00:32:07.783 --> 00:32:09.986
Why are you looking at me?

803
00:32:10.086 --> 00:32:13.689
Because you're the person.

804
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:15.157
You wait till I make jam.

805
00:32:15.257 --> 00:32:18.060
That'll rock your world.

806
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.529
LUCY: What about a bit
more color in there?

807
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:21.763
I've got some lovely lilac.

808
00:32:21.863 --> 00:32:24.133
Oh, why not?

809
00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:27.003
They're, uh, for my boyfriend.

810
00:32:27.103 --> 00:32:29.038
I'm going to tell him
we're having a baby.

811
00:32:29.138 --> 00:32:30.306
That's great.

812
00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:32.274
I think so.

813
00:32:32.374 --> 00:32:35.111
Uh... He will too.
He definitely will.

814
00:32:35.211 --> 00:32:37.279
He's a bit of a control freak.

815
00:32:37.379 --> 00:32:42.318
I'm surprised he doesn't
wear the diaphragm.

816
00:32:42.418 --> 00:32:43.752
He's, uh...

817
00:32:43.852 --> 00:32:45.721
He's gonna hate me.

818
00:32:45.821 --> 00:32:49.125
( Sobbing )

819
00:32:49.225 --> 00:32:50.926
He's gonna hate me.

820
00:32:51.027 --> 00:32:52.228
( Sobbing )

821
00:32:52.328 --> 00:32:56.074
I-I-I love him so much!

822
00:32:56.098 --> 00:32:57.098
Yeah, I'm surprised.

823
00:32:57.133 --> 00:32:58.133
He sounds wonderful.

824
00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.902
I-I didn't I, I...

825
00:33:01.037 --> 00:33:02.104
( phone ringing )

826
00:33:02.204 --> 00:33:03.872
Um, I should...
Tell me what to do.

827
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.741
Whatever it is...
Just let me, um...

828
00:33:08.044 --> 00:33:10.079
Flowered Up.

829
00:33:10.179 --> 00:33:12.381
Yes, I can do a delivery.

830
00:33:12.481 --> 00:33:14.683
Right now? No, it's no problem.

831
00:33:14.783 --> 00:33:16.418
Hi.

832
00:33:16.518 --> 00:33:18.720
I was told to deliver
these to table 7?

833
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.257
Oh, certainly. It's
through there.

834
00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:34.635
Cute, huh?

835
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.672
Very cute.

836
00:33:36.772 --> 00:33:37.806
Fuck me if I'm wrong,

837
00:33:37.906 --> 00:33:39.608
but I think you want to kiss me.

838
00:33:39.708 --> 00:33:42.178
Coop, you and me.

839
00:33:43.245 --> 00:33:44.513
It's not going to happen.

840
00:33:44.613 --> 00:33:46.215
It's not?

841
00:33:47.649 --> 00:33:48.950
I'll be your friend.

842
00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:51.253
Well, that'll do.

843
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:55.257
For now.

844
00:34:02.098 --> 00:34:03.265
MOTHER: Really?

845
00:34:03.365 --> 00:34:04.833
My daughter's school
presentation?

846
00:34:04.933 --> 00:34:07.369
You should have let
them get T-shirts made.

847
00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:09.147
RACHEL: It's not really
that kind of deal.

848
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:10.372
Probably a blessing.

849
00:34:10.472 --> 00:34:12.174
Your father doesn't
have the body for them.

850
00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:13.942
Of course, I'm just
speaking from memory.

851
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:15.144
Hi.

852
00:34:15.244 --> 00:34:16.764
Lucy, darling, what
are you doing here?

853
00:34:16.788 --> 00:34:19.181
I helped H with her, um,
well, she invited me.

854
00:34:19.281 --> 00:34:21.350
Henrietta is ready to start now.

855
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:23.119
HENRIETTA: This is space.

856
00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:25.654
Space is many light-years away.

857
00:34:25.754 --> 00:34:29.825
Light-years are not made in days
or months, but in kilometers.

858
00:34:29.925 --> 00:34:31.793
There is a good reason for this,

859
00:34:31.893 --> 00:34:33.995
but I don't quite
understand it yet.

860
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.832
This picture is the Milky Way.

861
00:34:36.932 --> 00:34:38.300
It's made up of lots of stars

862
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.470
and there's a
celestial phenoma...

863
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.639
phe-nom-enon.

864
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:48.410
One of the best constellations
is Ursus Major, which is

865
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.746
Latin American for "Big Bear."

866
00:34:50.846 --> 00:34:52.548
It's called that because one day

867
00:34:52.648 --> 00:34:55.193
in the olden times that
never really happened,

868
00:34:55.217 --> 00:34:56.685
a naughty god called Zeus

869
00:34:56.785 --> 00:34:59.155
wanted to go to bed with
someone he wasn't married to.

870
00:34:59.255 --> 00:35:01.323
His wife was about
to catch him...

871
00:35:01.423 --> 00:35:03.859
( Henrietta's voice fades )

872
00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:22.744
and that's everything you
need to know about space.

873
00:35:29.084 --> 00:35:30.352
( Bell ringing )

874
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.688
So, good.

875
00:35:32.788 --> 00:35:34.022
Very good.

876
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.192
You have to go, right?

877
00:35:36.292 --> 00:35:37.559
Um... but I don't.

878
00:35:37.659 --> 00:35:39.661
I'm okay.

879
00:35:39.761 --> 00:35:42.298
Luce, I, uh...

880
00:35:46.101 --> 00:35:47.101
I think that we should

881
00:35:47.203 --> 00:35:49.838
talk about something.

882
00:35:49.938 --> 00:35:52.274
It's just, I don't know.

883
00:35:52.374 --> 00:35:54.014
When I'm with... Yeah,
uh, I do have to go.

884
00:35:54.038 --> 00:35:55.644
Oh. Actually, I just realized

885
00:35:55.744 --> 00:35:57.746
I've, um, got a delivery.

886
00:35:57.846 --> 00:36:00.115
Oh, yeah, right.

887
00:36:00.216 --> 00:36:02.451
You go.

888
00:36:02.551 --> 00:36:03.852
Yeah.

889
00:36:06.855 --> 00:36:08.324
Listen to this.

890
00:36:08.424 --> 00:36:10.544
"In her acceptance speech,
the distinguished scientist

891
00:36:10.592 --> 00:36:13.495
"paid tribute to her husband, Dr.
Chris Davis." Spelt wrong.

892
00:36:13.595 --> 00:36:16.265
"Tomorrow the pair celebrate
their 42nd wedding anniversary

893
00:36:16.365 --> 00:36:18.667
"after eloping together
on the day they met.

894
00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:20.567
"When asked how they could

895
00:36:20.667 --> 00:36:22.427
"it would all work out,

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:26.308

897
00:36:26.408 --> 00:36:28.377
"'You don't know. You

898
00:36:28.477 --> 00:36:30.812
"'But you take the

899
00:36:30.912 --> 00:36:33.315
'Sure works for people
who don't love enough.'"

900
00:36:33.415 --> 00:36:35.651
Oh... Oh...

901
00:36:35.751 --> 00:36:37.853
Do you guys believe in
love at first sight?

902
00:36:37.953 --> 00:36:40.256
Well, it saves time.

903
00:36:42.391 --> 00:36:44.360
No, really, that you could

904
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:49.064
meet someone, or just...
cross a room,

905
00:36:49.164 --> 00:36:50.532
and with that one glance

906
00:36:50.632 --> 00:36:53.335
you could look in their
eyes and see their soul.

907
00:36:53.435 --> 00:36:57.373
Do you believe
that could happen?

908
00:36:57.473 --> 00:36:58.707
No.

909
00:36:58.807 --> 00:37:00.576
Absolutely not.

910
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.645
No, me, neither.

911
00:37:08.317 --> 00:37:11.329
WOMAN: These are
due back Thursday.

912
00:37:11.353 --> 00:37:13.489
If we're closed, just put
them through the door.

913
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:14.290
Enjoy.

914
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.624
MAN: Thanks a lot.

915
00:37:15.724 --> 00:37:17.326
WOMAN: Thanks.

916
00:37:18.394 --> 00:37:19.995
Hi. These, please.

917
00:37:36.345 --> 00:37:37.813
And this as well.

918
00:37:44.185 --> 00:37:45.185
It's just...

919
00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:46.988
It's for research.

920
00:37:47.088 --> 00:37:49.425
Call it what you want, darling.

921
00:37:49.525 --> 00:37:51.336
It's actually out.

922
00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.228
Oh, that's okay. It
doesn't interest...

923
00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:55.089
Although it's due back.
I'll give him a call.

924
00:37:55.113 --> 00:37:56.113
Oh, no, honestly.

925
00:37:56.197 --> 00:37:57.433
Hey, trust me:

926
00:37:57.533 --> 00:37:59.234
this one you want to see.

927
00:37:59.335 --> 00:38:01.370
Hello, Cass?

928
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.038
Yes, Terri from the vid shop.

929
00:38:04.039 --> 00:38:05.641
I thought it was you.

930
00:38:05.741 --> 00:38:07.409
Mum!

931
00:38:07.509 --> 00:38:09.578
I was just dropping by
with the wedding snaps.

932
00:38:09.678 --> 00:38:11.947
Oh, I tell you, that
photographer should be sacked.

933
00:38:12.047 --> 00:38:13.349
He made me look like a thug.

934
00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:14.983
A thug in lilac.

935
00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:16.084
Anything good?

936
00:38:16.184 --> 00:38:18.387
N-no. N-no.

937
00:38:18.487 --> 00:38:20.389
TERRI: There's a lady
here needs your copy

938
00:38:20.489 --> 00:38:21.489
of Georgie's Bush.

939
00:38:21.523 --> 00:38:23.892
Georgie's Bush?

940
00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:25.727
It's for research.

941
00:38:25.827 --> 00:38:26.828
Oh.

942
00:38:26.928 --> 00:38:28.163
It's for Heck.

943
00:38:28.263 --> 00:38:30.632
He's very interested
in American politics.

944
00:38:30.732 --> 00:38:32.100
TERRI: She's bringing it 'round.

945
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.835
Well, I call that very sexy.

946
00:38:33.935 --> 00:38:36.171
Hmm?

947
00:38:36.271 --> 00:38:39.575
I wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers, would you?

948
00:38:42.678 --> 00:38:44.158
WOMAN ( on video ): Oh, Georgie!
Oh...

949
00:38:44.182 --> 00:38:45.747
WOMAN 2: Call me Mrs. Prejudice.

950
00:38:45.847 --> 00:38:47.182
( Women moaning )

951
00:38:47.282 --> 00:38:48.617
HECK: Babe, are you home?

952
00:38:48.717 --> 00:38:50.852
"You have won a share
of one million pounds."

953
00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:55.090
Oh, you are home.

954
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:56.892
Hi! Oh, God.

955
00:38:56.992 --> 00:38:59.828
Am I glad to see you.

956
00:38:59.928 --> 00:39:01.463
The morning I've had,

957
00:39:01.563 --> 00:39:03.865
I just had to get
away, you know?

958
00:39:05.901 --> 00:39:06.901
Shall I burn some lunch?

959
00:39:06.968 --> 00:39:09.037
Please.

960
00:39:09.137 --> 00:39:10.305
Hey, you got some vids.

961
00:39:10.406 --> 00:39:12.774
Yeah, don't bother looking.
I just got...

962
00:39:12.874 --> 00:39:13.775
This one's great.

963
00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:15.711
This one got pans, but whatever.

964
00:39:17.913 --> 00:39:20.849
And here's one that I
haven't seen before.

965
00:39:20.949 --> 00:39:22.884
Which? Are you... um...?

966
00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:23.984
( Snickers )

967
00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:25.463
Oh...

968
00:39:25.487 --> 00:39:27.756
They gave me the wrong one.

969
00:39:27.856 --> 00:39:28.590
Oh, my God. That...

970
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.026
The woman at the video store.

971
00:39:31.126 --> 00:39:33.028
I'll take it back.

972
00:39:33.128 --> 00:39:35.063
Yeah, take it back. Yeah,
that's excellent, yeah.

973
00:39:35.163 --> 00:39:36.465
I mean, what, it's porn?

974
00:39:36.565 --> 00:39:38.467
Right? It's degrading.

975
00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:40.478
It's offensive. God, yes.

976
00:39:40.502 --> 00:39:41.903
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.

977
00:39:42.003 --> 00:39:43.939
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting

978
00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:46.842
a big slack in that
department recently.

979
00:39:46.942 --> 00:39:49.210
I know it's my fault and it's all...
Yeah.

980
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.447
No, it's mine. I, um...

981
00:39:51.547 --> 00:39:53.882
But I don't want to watch this.

982
00:39:53.982 --> 00:39:55.250
Why?

983
00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:56.885
It doesn't turn me on.

984
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.059
Well, that's one of us.

985
00:40:04.159 --> 00:40:06.562
( People clamoring )

986
00:40:12.834 --> 00:40:16.204
I love the smell of hot
dog in the evening.

987
00:40:16.304 --> 00:40:19.675
It smells like...

988
00:40:19.775 --> 00:40:21.209
hot dog.

989
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:22.578
Yeah.

990
00:40:22.678 --> 00:40:24.880
Thing is, Ned, what I
wanted to ask was...

991
00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.515
Um, turkey.

992
00:40:26.615 --> 00:40:28.850
I was just wondering if
it was just a bit odd,

993
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.219
for you guys, you know,
after you got married...

994
00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:35.056
if, uh, the interplay
between you two

995
00:40:35.156 --> 00:40:37.358
got a bit... clutchy.

996
00:40:37.459 --> 00:40:38.359
Some onions?

997
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:40.161
No. Thanks.

998
00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:41.381
Because, what I'm finding...

999
00:40:41.463 --> 00:40:42.631
Mustard? Ketchup?

1000
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:46.468
I'm trying to talk to you here.

1001
00:40:46.568 --> 00:40:48.236
Oh, what about, dear boy?

1002
00:40:48.336 --> 00:40:51.006
Why, i-it's just,
I'm just, well...

1003
00:40:51.106 --> 00:40:53.475
I'm finding it a bit tricky
at the moment with Rachel.

1004
00:40:53.575 --> 00:40:55.877
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.

1005
00:40:55.977 --> 00:40:57.713
Sorry? Well, that's
our problem, you see.

1006
00:40:57.813 --> 00:41:01.850
The two of us, we could be
most pleasant to each other,

1007
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.786
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.

1008
00:41:04.886 --> 00:41:06.054
Yeah. Yeah.

1009
00:41:06.154 --> 00:41:07.723
Never mention relations.

1010
00:41:07.823 --> 00:41:09.758
As soon as you do, the
only concrete thought

1011
00:41:09.858 --> 00:41:11.627
running through my mind is...

1012
00:41:11.727 --> 00:41:15.163
that hound is putting
it up my daughter.

1013
00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:21.537
Rach!

1014
00:41:21.637 --> 00:41:25.707
( Crowd oohing and ahhing )

1015
00:41:31.847 --> 00:41:34.015
Darling, I don't know what
to do about your father.

1016
00:41:34.115 --> 00:41:35.316
He's never been

1017
00:41:35.416 --> 00:41:36.685
the last of the red-hot lovers

1018
00:41:36.785 --> 00:41:38.419
but, recently, it's
got to the point

1019
00:41:38.554 --> 00:41:40.565
where he's jealous
of a stiff wind.

1020
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:41.990
Hey, you guys.

1021
00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.124
Thank God you're here.

1022
00:41:43.224 --> 00:41:44.259
You have no idea.

1023
00:41:44.359 --> 00:41:45.661
Good. I've got you both.

1024
00:41:45.761 --> 00:41:47.929
Now, how are my
grandchildren coming along?

1025
00:41:48.029 --> 00:41:49.698
Could you get me away
from her, please?

1026
00:41:49.798 --> 00:41:51.032
Just hinting, darling.

1027
00:41:51.132 --> 00:41:52.568
One wants to have them

1028
00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:55.571
while one's still young
enough to pick them up.

1029
00:41:57.172 --> 00:41:58.907
Ooh!

1030
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:07.592
What I do with your parents
is remind myself that,

1031
00:42:07.616 --> 00:42:10.218
if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.

1032
00:42:19.595 --> 00:42:21.162
What's up, baby?

1033
00:42:22.363 --> 00:42:23.899
Let's go home.

1034
00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:27.645
Now, remember, try not to look
like you're my child, okay?

1035
00:42:27.669 --> 00:42:29.204
Because it... it...
it puts men off.

1036
00:42:29.304 --> 00:42:30.438
But keep you eyes peeled,

1037
00:42:30.606 --> 00:42:32.440
and, if you spot
anyone you think,

1038
00:42:32.608 --> 00:42:34.175
you know, well, he looks nice...

1039
00:42:34.275 --> 00:42:35.611
Hi. Luce!

1040
00:42:35.711 --> 00:42:37.478
Hey! Hey! How you doing?

1041
00:42:37.613 --> 00:42:39.147
This is my friend Beth.

1042
00:42:39.247 --> 00:42:40.658
She's on the roam.

1043
00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:42.618
Now you found a friend.
Can I go home?

1044
00:42:42.718 --> 00:42:44.986
No. I'm trying to
find her a man.

1045
00:42:45.086 --> 00:42:47.222
There aren't any. Trust me.
I've looked.

1046
00:42:47.322 --> 00:42:48.489
Oh, careful!

1047
00:42:48.624 --> 00:42:49.658
Sorry, Missus.

1048
00:42:49.758 --> 00:42:51.693
Don't call me Missus.

1049
00:42:53.862 --> 00:42:55.330
Hello.

1050
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.833
All right.

1051
00:43:04.472 --> 00:43:07.042
Brilliant.

1052
00:43:07.142 --> 00:43:09.811
( Singsongy ): You've
got a boyfriend.

1053
00:43:09.911 --> 00:43:11.689
You've got a boyfriend.

1054
00:43:11.713 --> 00:43:14.515
No, I haven't. Not yet.

1055
00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.286
I can't wait till you
get a boyfriend.

1056
00:43:18.386 --> 00:43:20.221
You probably can, actually.

1057
00:43:20.321 --> 00:43:21.923
You could even get a husband.

1058
00:43:22.023 --> 00:43:23.959
You're old enough, and
I don't like Heck.

1059
00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:27.495
H, I should explain
something to you.

1060
00:43:27.663 --> 00:43:31.399
I do believe I will be with one
person for the rest of my life,

1061
00:43:31.499 --> 00:43:34.269
but that person will be a woman.

1062
00:43:34.369 --> 00:43:36.204
I understand.

1063
00:43:36.304 --> 00:43:37.673
You do?

1064
00:43:37.773 --> 00:43:40.141
My best friend is
Natalie Curtis.

1065
00:43:40.241 --> 00:43:43.278
I'd rather spend the rest of
my life with her than any boy.

1066
00:43:43.378 --> 00:43:46.214
There you go.

1067
00:43:46.314 --> 00:43:49.250
It doesn't mean you're
a lesbian or anything.

1068
00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.920
Come on! Let's go!

1069
00:43:56.692 --> 00:43:58.426
I'll put the kettle on, babe.

1070
00:43:58.526 --> 00:44:00.228
I'll have a beer instead.

1071
00:44:00.328 --> 00:44:02.097
Really?

1072
00:44:03.198 --> 00:44:05.233
I was going to ask
you, but, um...

1073
00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:06.401
But what?

1074
00:44:07.736 --> 00:44:09.237
Rach, are you pregnant?

1075
00:44:13.474 --> 00:44:14.976
No. No, I'm not. No.

1076
00:44:15.076 --> 00:44:18.346
I just thought it might
explain your recent...

1077
00:44:20.248 --> 00:44:21.482
whatever.

1078
00:44:21.582 --> 00:44:22.984
It doesn't matter.

1079
00:44:27.823 --> 00:44:29.424
Unless, um...

1080
00:44:30.726 --> 00:44:32.327
Unless what?

1081
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:38.599
Umm... Do you want
to get pregnant?

1082
00:44:38.734 --> 00:44:41.779
You and my mum.

1083
00:44:41.803 --> 00:44:44.239
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait,

1084
00:44:44.339 --> 00:44:46.007
but until what?

1085
00:44:46.107 --> 00:44:48.910
We're even more settled?

1086

Rob, hey, what's up?

1090
00:45:04.559 --> 00:45:05.994
No. I'm good, man.

1091
00:45:06.094 --> 00:45:08.263
Yeah, yeah, they're
in my briefcase.

1092
00:45:08.363 --> 00:45:09.397

Hello.

Hello?

1097
00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:40.838
Hey, gorgeous. That was Rob.

1098
00:45:40.862 --> 00:45:44.099
Look, I'm really sorry
about this, but, um...

1099
00:45:46.935 --> 00:45:48.669
Of course you should still go.

1100
00:45:48.804 --> 00:45:50.244
I wouldn't put you
through my evening

1101
00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:52.340
for all the coke in Colombia.

1102
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.040
You know, there'll be
the usual bollocks;

1103
00:45:54.064 --> 00:45:55.064
everyone will get pissed.

1104
00:45:55.143 --> 00:45:56.543
( Phone ringing )
I'll get pissed...

1105
00:45:56.611 --> 00:45:59.280
and start singing country
and Western songs badly,

1106
00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.548
like I always do.

1107
00:46:00.648 --> 00:46:01.648
Hello.

1108

Heck. It's Luce.

Hey, Luce. How's it going?

1110
00:46:06.054 --> 00:46:08.156
It's Luce. What's up?

1111
00:46:08.256 --> 00:46:11.059
Nothing. My phone
just rang, and...

1112
00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:13.594
Say, are you busy Tuesday night?

1113
00:46:13.694 --> 00:46:15.931
Do you mind escorting
my wife somewhere?

1114
00:46:16.031 --> 00:46:17.431
It's just, like,
I've got this wanky

1115
00:46:17.455 --> 00:46:18.834
bug thing which I
can't get out of,

1116
00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:20.268
and it would be really great

1117
00:46:20.368 --> 00:46:22.703
if you'd look after Rach for me?
Go on, say yes.

1118
00:46:22.838 --> 00:46:24.305
Go on. Then, yes.

1119
00:46:24.405 --> 00:46:25.850
Brilliant. Brilliant.

1120
00:46:25.874 --> 00:46:28.709
Well, Rach will ring
you with the details

1121
00:46:28.844 --> 00:46:31.579
and, um... be safe.

1122
00:46:31.679 --> 00:46:33.481
You, too.

1123
00:46:35.884 --> 00:46:38.186
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.

1124
00:46:38.286 --> 00:46:41.589
But she's your "soul mate
for life" -type, then.

1125
00:46:41.689 --> 00:46:44.860
Never belt her. Beer.

1126
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:49.907
Does she know where we're going?

Chop him!

kind of shrill.

When you shout.

1133

You want them to hear
your abuse better,

1134
00:47:06.447 --> 00:47:08.893
you've got to project it.

1135
00:47:08.917 --> 00:47:10.151
Teach me.

1136
00:47:10.251 --> 00:47:13.554
Okay. First off, tighten
your stomach muscles.

1137
00:47:13.654 --> 00:47:15.490
I don't think I've got any.

1138
00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.625
Yeah, you do. You really do.

They're right here.

1140
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.361
There? Uh-huh.

1141
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:22.230
Tighten. Tighten.

1142
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:23.498
Tense them.

1143
00:47:23.598 --> 00:47:24.765
They're pretty tense.

1144
00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.911
Okay. Next, broaden
your diaphragm.

1145
00:47:26.935 --> 00:47:28.369
My what?

1146
00:47:29.604 --> 00:47:30.638
It's here.

1147

Oh.

1148
00:47:32.607 --> 00:47:35.210
Okay, push it out
against my hand.

You feel my hand?

1150
00:47:38.746 --> 00:47:42.450
Maybe if you put
them both there.

1151
00:47:48.089 --> 00:47:53.161
Okay, and now for the big one.

1152

mouth as a cathedral.

No. You've lost me. Come on.

00:48:00.435 --> 00:48:02.737
No. The muscles, the diaphragm...
I'm there, but...

1155
00:48:02.837 --> 00:48:03.939
It's a space thing.

1156
00:48:04.039 --> 00:48:05.319
All right? Your
mouth is that big

1157
00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:07.608
that you have to
fill it with sound,

1158
00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:09.945
deep from inside,
filling the space,

1159
00:48:10.045 --> 00:48:11.712
then throwing it out.

1160
00:48:11.812 --> 00:48:13.991

00:52:47.588 --> 00:52:49.023
WOMAN: Milly! Milly, darling!

1264
00:52:49.123 --> 00:52:50.603
I mean, it's always,
always, isn't it?

1265
00:52:50.627 --> 00:52:51.259
WOMAN: Sorry...

1266
00:52:51.359 --> 00:52:52.360
WOMAN ♪2: That's okay...

1267
00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.861
Okay? Don't move.

1268
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:55.563
What?

1269
00:52:55.663 --> 00:52:58.966
I notice a-a girl back there
that I never called back.

1270
00:52:59.066 --> 00:53:01.269
Just stay perfectly still, okay?

1271
00:53:01.369 --> 00:53:03.271
We'll get through this.

1272
00:53:10.811 --> 00:53:12.847
Did you ever...

1273
00:53:12.947 --> 00:53:15.149
you know, cross the street?

1274
00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.017
Back to Patty's?

1275
00:53:17.117 --> 00:53:18.386
And what?

1276
00:53:18.486 --> 00:53:21.121
And what the hell are
you talking about?

1277
00:53:21.256 --> 00:53:22.790
Drink after work tonight?

1278
00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.124
Dinner with Heck.

1279
00:53:24.259 --> 00:53:27.304
I mean, did you ever,

1280
00:53:27.328 --> 00:53:29.430
fancy or think you might have...

1281
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:33.601
Briefly, before you realized you didn't...
another... woman?

1282
00:53:33.701 --> 00:53:35.169
Why?

1283
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:37.472
I'm trying to find
someone for Beth,

1284
00:53:37.572 --> 00:53:39.574
and I thought I'd
double my chances.

1285
00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:40.808
( Gargling )

1286
00:53:40.908 --> 00:53:43.678
Already tried it,
didn't happen for me.

1287
00:53:43.778 --> 00:53:44.979
I like men.

1288
00:53:45.079 --> 00:53:47.615
I mean, I hate
men, but you know.

1289
00:53:47.715 --> 00:53:50.327
Oh, I always hoped to do a woman

1290
00:53:50.351 --> 00:53:51.952
before I died, but
it's kind of like,

1291
00:53:52.052 --> 00:53:53.821
I want to go to Norway sometime.

1292
00:53:53.921 --> 00:53:55.155
Do you know what I mean?

1293
00:53:55.290 --> 00:53:56.757
Probably never gonna happen.

1294
00:53:59.093 --> 00:54:00.828
Is Heck taking you to dinner?

1295
00:54:00.928 --> 00:54:01.996
I'm taking him.

1296
00:54:03.631 --> 00:54:05.666
How perfect.

1297
00:54:07.335 --> 00:54:09.404
( Horn blaring )

1298
00:54:14.742 --> 00:54:16.677
That was fun.

1299
00:54:16.777 --> 00:54:19.179
Wasn't it fun?

1300
00:54:19.314 --> 00:54:21.582
I had a good time.

1301
00:54:23.017 --> 00:54:24.685
You know, Rach, I think maybe...

1302
00:54:24.785 --> 00:54:26.321
Hey, the Heath...

1303
00:54:26.421 --> 00:54:28.501
Do you remember that night
you took me in the bushes?

1304
00:54:28.525 --> 00:54:29.857
I never took you in the bushes.

1305
00:54:29.957 --> 00:54:31.492
Sorry. Wrong guy.

1306
00:54:31.592 --> 00:54:32.960
I took you up against the tree.

1307
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.338
Can't be dealing with bushes,

1308
00:54:34.362 --> 00:54:36.340
nettles and deadly nightshade.

1309
00:54:36.364 --> 00:54:37.498
Let's do it.

1310
00:54:37.598 --> 00:54:38.399
What?

1311
00:54:38.499 --> 00:54:39.834
Let's go. Let's do it now.

1312
00:54:39.934 --> 00:54:41.345
No.

1313
00:54:41.369 --> 00:54:44.339
Rach, no.

1314
00:54:45.973 --> 00:54:48.385
Rach?

1315
00:54:48.409 --> 00:54:50.678
Rach, where are you?

1316
00:54:50.778 --> 00:54:52.780
Come on, darling.
( snide chuckle )

1317
00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.982
Rachel!

1318
00:54:55.082 --> 00:54:56.417
I just, I just don't understand

1319
00:54:56.517 --> 00:54:58.357
why we have to do this
stuff anymore, you know?

1320
00:54:58.453 --> 00:54:59.887
We've got a flat.

1321
00:54:59.987 --> 00:55:01.689
It's a good one!

1322
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:03.309
And I've confiscated
your mother's keys

1323
00:55:03.358 --> 00:55:04.792
so she can't sneak
up on us anymore

1324
00:55:04.892 --> 00:55:07.595
and I swear that woman's
got a sex radar.

1325
00:55:07.695 --> 00:55:09.129
We've got a bed! You know, warm;

1326
00:55:09.229 --> 00:55:10.765
it's welcoming; it smells nice;

1327
00:55:10.865 --> 00:55:12.905
and it's a damn sight better
than this arsing place.

1328
00:55:12.929 --> 00:55:14.902
Ah! Jesus Christ!

1329
00:55:15.002 --> 00:55:16.437
Let's go.

1330
00:55:16.537 --> 00:55:19.106
No, nettles everywhere.
What are you doing?

1331
00:55:19.206 --> 00:55:20.541
Taking off your clothes.

1332
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:22.610
That's one of the good
things about being a man.

1333
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:23.711
Hmm?

1334
00:55:23.811 --> 00:55:25.221
You can do these things
without stripping off.

1335
00:55:25.245 --> 00:55:26.885
Just a zip, a simple
zip, is all you need.

1336
00:55:26.947 --> 00:55:29.393
Give it a yank, and you're
well away, darling.

1337
00:55:29.417 --> 00:55:31.519
Are you going to talk
all through this?

1338
00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:33.788
Did I mention we have a bed?

1339
00:55:35.155 --> 00:55:36.657
( Rustling )

1340
00:55:36.757 --> 00:55:38.025
What was that?

1341
00:55:38.125 --> 00:55:39.436
What?

1342
00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.797
Nothing. Nothing.

1343
00:55:44.565 --> 00:55:47.402
( Branch snaps )

1344
00:55:47.502 --> 00:55:48.903
All right, whoever's
behind there,

1345
00:55:49.003 --> 00:55:51.672
come out before we beat
the crap out of you.

1346
00:55:51.772 --> 00:55:53.608
Yeah, damn it.

1347
00:55:55.876 --> 00:55:56.876
Terribly sorry.

1348
00:55:56.911 --> 00:55:57.945
Sorry. Sorry.

1349
00:55:58.045 --> 00:55:59.847
Oh, God.

1350
00:55:59.947 --> 00:56:01.749
We were trying not
to disturb you.

1351
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:03.217
That's fine, really.

1352
00:56:03.317 --> 00:56:05.019
Disturb us? No, no, you
didn't disturb us.

1353
00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:06.887
We were just...

1354
00:56:06.987 --> 00:56:08.432
So were we.

1355
00:56:08.456 --> 00:56:10.825
I see. You think we were...

1356
00:56:10.925 --> 00:56:12.960
No, and we're married.

1357
00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.438
And we have a bed.

1358
00:56:14.462 --> 00:56:15.696
I'm Heck, by the way.

1359
00:56:15.796 --> 00:56:16.564
Michael.

1360
00:56:16.664 --> 00:56:18.499
How do you do? Michael, too.

1361
00:56:18.599 --> 00:56:19.700
Oh, really. Rachel.

1362
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.445
( Giggling )

1363
00:56:21.469 --> 00:56:24.839
It's lovely to meet
you two chaps.

1364
00:56:24.939 --> 00:56:25.740
( Sighs )

1365
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.509
Must be very nice to be married.

1366
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:30.911
We only just met this evening.

1367
00:56:31.011 --> 00:56:35.115
Yes, sometimes I feel
like we did, too.

1368
00:56:58.906 --> 00:57:00.307
Hi. No, no.

1369
00:57:00.475 --> 00:57:02.115
You're not your happy to see...
You can't.

1370
00:57:02.215 --> 00:57:03.735
I don't want you to
be happy to see me.

1371
00:57:03.782 --> 00:57:04.579
Okay.

1372
00:57:04.679 --> 00:57:06.581
Okay, so, so I'm here

1373
00:57:06.681 --> 00:57:08.121
because I don't know
what's going on.

1374
00:57:08.148 --> 00:57:09.148
I don't...

1375
00:57:09.216 --> 00:57:10.350
You make me feel something.

1376
00:57:10.485 --> 00:57:12.720
Something I absolutely
cannot feel.

1377
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.789
I'm married. I'm married,
for Christ's sake.

1378
00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:17.758
I have a husband.
This man that I...

1379
00:57:17.858 --> 00:57:20.628
This lovely guy. He's
done nothing wrong.

1380
00:57:20.728 --> 00:57:23.363
Ah, I was wondering
if you could help me.

1381
00:57:23.498 --> 00:57:25.509
I'm hoping to start
a herb garden.

1382
00:57:25.533 --> 00:57:27.401
A little corner space.

1383
00:57:27.502 --> 00:57:29.303
Not much light. These, these,

1384
00:57:29.403 --> 00:57:31.506
on the house, go.

1385
00:57:33.974 --> 00:57:36.010
Okay, so do you see?

1386
00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.311
You have to see.

1387
00:57:37.411 --> 00:57:38.813
I can't do this.

1388
00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:40.557
I can't actually do this.

1389
00:57:40.581 --> 00:57:42.583
So whatever it is, or
was, it's got to stop

1390
00:57:42.683 --> 00:57:45.052
and it's got to stop now.
Do you understand?

1391
00:57:45.152 --> 00:57:46.521
It's over.

1392
00:58:26.426 --> 00:58:27.728
Ow! What, what, what?

1393
00:58:27.828 --> 00:58:29.363
Thorns. Thorns in my bum.

1394
00:58:29.463 --> 00:58:31.365
Ow. Ow.

1395
00:58:31.465 --> 00:58:33.200
( Iaughing )

1396
00:58:34.902 --> 00:58:36.737
I'm sorry.

1397
00:58:36.837 --> 00:58:37.614
Ah!

1398
00:58:37.638 --> 00:58:40.975
( Door shuts )

1399
00:58:41.075 --> 00:58:42.442
( bell rings )

1400
00:58:42.577 --> 00:58:44.378
It's another customer.

1401
00:58:44.478 --> 00:58:45.478
( Iaughing )

1402
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:47.247
HECK: Hello?

1403
00:58:51.251 --> 00:58:53.487
Luce?

1404
00:58:53.588 --> 00:58:55.255
( Footsteps approaching )

1405
00:58:55.355 --> 00:58:57.091
Luce, are you in the back?

1406
00:58:57.191 --> 00:58:59.359
Um, don't come in, Heck.

1407
00:58:59.459 --> 00:59:00.928
I...

1408
00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.766
I was, um...

1409
00:59:05.866 --> 00:59:09.336
I was sorting, you know,
counting the, uh...

1410
00:59:09.436 --> 00:59:11.038
Hey.

1411
00:59:11.138 --> 00:59:12.339
Hey, yourself.

1412
00:59:12.439 --> 00:59:14.875
What do you want, Heck?

1413
00:59:14.975 --> 00:59:19.213
To buy some flowers. What else?

1414
00:59:19.313 --> 00:59:20.948
Flowers, of course.

1415
00:59:21.048 --> 00:59:23.951
Not for me, for my wife Rachel.

1416
00:59:24.051 --> 00:59:28.055
Recently, she's just been
a bit, I don't know...

1417
00:59:28.155 --> 00:59:29.256
You know what they say,

1418
00:59:29.356 --> 00:59:30.636
there's nothing
quite as cheering

1419
00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:31.692
as a well-timed bloom.

1420
00:59:31.792 --> 00:59:33.637
So I thought one of your
finest arrangements.

1421
00:59:33.661 --> 00:59:34.662
Absolutely.

1422
00:59:34.762 --> 00:59:36.731
What does she like?

1423
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:40.677
Well, you know what she likes.

1424
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:43.771
Lilies. She likes lilies.

1425
00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:47.207
Lilies, right. Well,
that's simple.

1426
00:59:47.307 --> 00:59:48.943
Yeah.

1427
00:59:49.043 --> 00:59:50.878
So did you enjoy the
football the other night?

1428
00:59:50.978 --> 00:59:53.347
Um, it was an experience.

1429
00:59:53.447 --> 00:59:58.318
And how did you find Rachel?

1430
00:59:58.418 --> 00:59:59.418
Fine.

1431
00:59:59.486 --> 01:00:01.388
I mean, I wouldn't...

1432
01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:03.691
Fine.

1433
01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:06.827
I don't suppose she, um... no.

1434
01:00:06.927 --> 01:00:08.796
Well, I was just wondering

1435
01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:16.136
if she said anything
about me, or, um...

1436
01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:21.575
I just think I'm doing
something wrong is all.

1437
01:00:21.676 --> 01:00:23.377
I mean, that's what I think.

1438
01:00:23.477 --> 01:00:29.149
And if she said what it is
that I'm doing or not doing,

1439
01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:30.785
then I can stop it,

1440
01:00:30.885 --> 01:00:33.754
or start or whatever, you see?

1441
01:00:33.854 --> 01:00:35.990
And then we can...

1442
01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.092
like before.

1443
01:00:38.192 --> 01:00:41.361
We can get back to
being like before.

1444
01:00:43.297 --> 01:00:44.799
She didn't say anything.

1445
01:00:44.899 --> 01:00:47.201
No?

1446
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:49.136
I've embarrassed you,

1447
01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:52.372
and myself, which is
normal, very normal.

1448
01:00:52.472 --> 01:00:53.472
Um, these are beautiful.

1449
01:00:53.507 --> 01:00:54.574
How much do I owe you?

1450
01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:56.410
No, they're on the house.

1451
01:00:58.278 --> 01:00:59.313
Thanks.

1452
01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:02.349
You should ask her, you know?

1453
01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:04.218
Not me.

1454
01:01:04.318 --> 01:01:07.755
Bless you, but, um...

1455
01:01:07.855 --> 01:01:09.857
I can't ask Rachel if
there's anything wrong.

1456
01:01:09.957 --> 01:01:12.960
I mean, that's way too scary.

1457
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.729
Why?

1458
01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:18.332
What if there is?

1459
01:01:20.735 --> 01:01:21.936
Thanks.

1460
01:01:40.387 --> 01:01:41.655
Rachel!

1461
01:01:41.756 --> 01:01:42.757
Rachel, wait!

1462
01:01:42.857 --> 01:01:44.792
Luce, please. Just talk to me.

1463
01:01:44.892 --> 01:01:46.426
What do you want me to say?

1464
01:01:46.526 --> 01:01:47.762
I heard him! Jesus!

1465
01:01:47.862 --> 01:01:49.773
I'm lying there,
and I heard him,

1466
01:01:49.797 --> 01:01:50.865
and he's blaming himself!

1467
01:01:50.965 --> 01:01:52.466
You can put an end to this.

1468
01:01:52.566 --> 01:01:53.566
How?

1469
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.835
Tell me to go.

1470
01:01:57.838 --> 01:02:00.507
Tell me that's what you
want and I will walk away,

1471
01:02:00.607 --> 01:02:02.877
and you will never see me again.

1472
01:02:05.012 --> 01:02:07.147
Is that what you want?

1473
01:02:09.483 --> 01:02:12.219
I want you.

1474
01:02:16.791 --> 01:02:18.158
Luce...

1475
01:02:18.258 --> 01:02:21.328
I know.

1476
01:02:21.428 --> 01:02:24.464
I can't...

1477
01:02:24.564 --> 01:02:26.000
I know.

1478
01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.474
We'll be okay.

1479
01:02:39.579 --> 01:02:41.481
Don't forget me.

1480
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.820
I won't remember anything else.

1481
01:03:27.127 --> 01:03:29.429
Come on, Jeff. You
scratch my back,

1482
01:03:29.529 --> 01:03:31.765
and I'll kiss your ass.

1483
01:03:31.866 --> 01:03:33.600
Okay, can you repeat
that, please?

1484
01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.170
We'll go 41 flat.

1485
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.948
Okay, well, let me just fax
it over on his computer

1486
01:03:37.972 --> 01:03:39.239
and crunch some numbers.

1487
01:03:39.339 --> 01:03:41.175
He can't go any higher.
He hasn't got it.

1488
01:03:41.275 --> 01:03:43.978
Yeah, screen's flashing
red at me here, Jeff.

1489
01:03:44.078 --> 01:03:45.445
It's not going to cut it.

1490
01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:47.714
In fact, the figure
that I'm reading is...

1491
01:03:47.882 --> 01:03:49.549
Yeah, well, the
figure I'm reading

1492
01:03:49.649 --> 01:03:51.485
is 41 and a half, that's 41.5,

1493
01:03:51.585 --> 01:03:53.487
Any lower just can't be a go.

1494
01:03:53.587 --> 01:03:55.155
That's way too much.

1495
01:03:55.255 --> 01:03:57.457
It's too much.

1496
01:03:57.557 --> 01:03:59.459
So let's do it, Jeff.
Let's work our web.

1497
01:03:59.559 --> 01:04:00.904
Give me 41.1, give me that.

1498
01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:02.096
We're feeling no pain there.

1499
01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:04.531
You know what? If we're up .1,

1500
01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:05.831
let's, uh, let's have some fun.

1501
01:04:05.855 --> 01:04:06.855
Let's double down.

1502
01:04:06.901 --> 01:04:09.469
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

1503
01:04:12.806 --> 01:04:14.208
All right, keep on coming.

1504
01:04:14.308 --> 01:04:16.148
Keep on coming. Give me three.
Three's willing.

1505
01:04:16.172 --> 01:04:17.611
Give me that right now.
You will?

1506
01:04:17.711 --> 01:04:20.047
Well, then go one more.
Go to four.

1507
01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:22.983
I really, really, really
don't want to do it.

1508
01:04:26.053 --> 01:04:27.964
Jeff, you know, don't
take that tone with me.

1509
01:04:27.988 --> 01:04:29.508
You know, I've given
you a chance here.

1510
01:04:29.556 --> 01:04:30.991
Now do you want to be a big dog,

1511
01:04:31.091 --> 01:04:33.171
or do you want to play on
the porch with the puppies?

1512
01:04:33.195 --> 01:04:35.029
Yeah. Yeah, I feel that.

1513
01:04:35.129 --> 01:04:37.097
Okay, last one, my friend.
Over the cliff.

1514
01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:38.997
I'm holding your hand.
I'm cupping your balls.

1515
01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:40.698
I'm there with you and
I'm there for you.

1516
01:04:40.732 --> 01:04:43.537
And you've got to ask yourself,
Jeffrey: do you trust me?

1517
01:04:43.637 --> 01:04:47.641
Do you trust me?

1518
01:04:47.741 --> 01:04:50.577
Congratulations. We can deal.

1519
01:04:52.379 --> 01:04:54.949
My boy, for that you get a
bonus as big as my knob.

1520
01:04:55.049 --> 01:04:56.483
Screw your bonus.

1521
01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.743
I wish I could. Now where do
you want to go for a drink?

1522
01:04:58.767 --> 01:05:00.554
Screw you, too, Rob.

1523
01:05:00.654 --> 01:05:03.523
Hecky, what is it?

1524
01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:04.824
It makes me sick, you know?

1525
01:05:04.959 --> 01:05:07.461
You lie. You just lie.

1526
01:05:10.998 --> 01:05:12.499
Well, so do you.

1527
01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:14.668
Not anymore.

1528
01:05:18.973 --> 01:05:20.707
Heck... Hecky?

1529
01:05:20.807 --> 01:05:22.576
Hecky, come back.

1530
01:05:28.215 --> 01:05:29.216
Hi.

1531
01:05:29.316 --> 01:05:31.585
Afternoon.

1532
01:05:31.685 --> 01:05:33.287
Looking for a breakup plant.

1533
01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:34.388
A what?

1534
01:05:34.488 --> 01:05:35.822
A breakup plant.

1535
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:37.024
Explain.

1536
01:05:37.124 --> 01:05:38.725
Well, I don't like
my girlfriend.

1537
01:05:38.825 --> 01:05:40.427
I want to break up with her

1538
01:05:40.527 --> 01:05:41.895
via the means of plant.

1539
01:05:41.996 --> 01:05:43.663
Well, it should be
a breakup bouquet,

1540
01:05:43.763 --> 01:05:45.132
and it should be hydrangeas.

1541
01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:47.734
They mean "It's over,
but think well of me."

1542
01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:48.834
Perfect.

1543
01:05:48.902 --> 01:05:50.013
I'll take one.

1544
01:05:50.037 --> 01:05:51.037
One bouquet?

1545
01:05:51.105 --> 01:05:52.506
One pair of what's it.

1546
01:05:52.606 --> 01:05:54.108
Well, that's not a lot.

1547
01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:56.510
Well, I don't care if
she thinks well of me.

1548
01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:59.279
Do you know what? Piss off.

1549
01:05:59.379 --> 01:06:01.515
Pardon me? Out. Get
out of my shop.

1550
01:06:01.615 --> 01:06:04.284
She's well rid of
your fat ass anyway.

1551
01:06:22.902 --> 01:06:24.638
Mum?

1552
01:06:24.738 --> 01:06:27.474
I'll be right out!

1553
01:06:27.574 --> 01:06:29.409
Take your time.

1554
01:06:44.091 --> 01:06:46.293
Well, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?

1555
01:06:46.393 --> 01:06:50.130
Blow your nose, then explain.

1556
01:06:54.534 --> 01:06:56.203
I met this girl.

1557
01:06:58.672 --> 01:07:00.140
She's with someone else.

1558
01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.509
Does she love you?

1559
01:07:04.078 --> 01:07:06.246
I don't know.

1560
01:07:06.346 --> 01:07:08.115
No.

1561
01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:12.652
Yes.

1562
01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:17.191
But it doesn't matter.

1563
01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:21.095
Oh, it's all that matters.

1564
01:07:21.195 --> 01:07:22.729
She's with someone else.

1565
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:24.231
She can't...

1566
01:07:28.602 --> 01:07:30.737
When Dad left you,
he broke your heart.

1567
01:07:33.006 --> 01:07:34.641
It mends again.

1568
01:07:39.279 --> 01:07:41.014
Look at you. You look fantastic.

1569
01:07:41.115 --> 01:07:42.549
( Chuckles )

1570
01:07:42.649 --> 01:07:45.585
I may be older than God, but
I can still make an effort.

1571
01:07:45.685 --> 01:07:46.920
A date?

1572
01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:47.921
Does my mother

1573
01:07:48.021 --> 01:07:49.223
have a date?

1574
01:07:49.323 --> 01:07:51.825
I'm going to eat food
with a man, yes.

1575
01:07:51.925 --> 01:07:54.194
How do you feel?

1576
01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:57.497
Oh, um, well, you know,

1577
01:07:57.597 --> 01:08:00.467
when you're holding
a hot cup of coffee

1578
01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.636
and you realize you're
going to sneeze?

1579
01:08:02.736 --> 01:08:04.838
That's how I feel.

1580
01:08:04.938 --> 01:08:06.940
Come here.

1581
01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.776
( Chuckles ): Oh, baby.

1582
01:08:14.748 --> 01:08:16.049

Shoot.

I-I wanted to talk to

1601
01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:10.370
I have to talk to you because
this thing happened.

1602
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:14.641
I wasn't looking for it.

I went crazy, Heck.

1610
01:09:49.343 --> 01:09:53.413
I went crazy for someone,
and it wasn't you.

1611
01:09:58.252 --> 01:10:00.254
I'm sorry.

01:10:27.146 --> 01:10:29.583
I'm staying.

1619
01:10:32.652 --> 01:10:36.390
I couldn't, wouldn't leave you.

1620
01:10:38.325 --> 01:10:40.594
You're my best friend.

1621
01:10:41.395 --> 01:10:44.097
And that was enough before.

1622
01:10:44.197 --> 01:10:47.367
It'll be enough again, so...

1623
01:11:12.326 --> 01:11:14.894
( birds chirping )

1624
01:11:21.335 --> 01:11:24.638
( footsteps approaching )

1625
01:11:27.106 --> 01:11:29.676
Coop.

1626
01:11:29.776 --> 01:11:31.077
It is you, then.

1627
01:11:31.177 --> 01:11:32.746
Is it?

1628
01:11:32.846 --> 01:11:34.814
Is what? I don't...

1629
01:11:34.914 --> 01:11:36.215
Heck doesn't know.

1630
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:39.453
He said that she
didn't tell who.

1631
01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:42.722
But, um, I figured it out.

1632
01:11:43.857 --> 01:11:45.258
What'd he say?

1633
01:11:45.359 --> 01:11:47.927
Just tell me I'm wrong, girl.

1634
01:11:48.027 --> 01:11:50.597
Hmm? Tell me.

1635
01:11:53.433 --> 01:11:55.034
You dumb slut.

1636
01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:57.003
Don't start, Coop.

1637
01:11:57.103 --> 01:11:58.271
Don't start?

1638
01:11:58.372 --> 01:12:01.174
Her husband, her
flippin' husband

1639
01:12:01.274 --> 01:12:02.674
calls me in the
middle of the night.

1640
01:12:02.742 --> 01:12:04.511
You want to know how he was?

1641
01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:06.380
He was busted.
Just-just get out.

1642
01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:09.182
What was that thing that you said?
What was that?

1643
01:12:09.282 --> 01:12:11.184
Never wreck another couple.

1644
01:12:11.284 --> 01:12:14.388
You really stuck to that
one good, didn't you?

1645
01:12:20.126 --> 01:12:22.529
( Bell dings )

1646
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:25.164
( door closes )

1647
01:12:25.264 --> 01:12:26.900
Okay, then.

1648
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.444
Okay. Yeah.

1649
01:12:28.468 --> 01:12:30.970
See you. Bye.

1650
01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:40.780
It's wonderful. Thank you.

1651
01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.017
There's a lovely section on
cooking with your children.

1652
01:12:44.117 --> 01:12:45.985
Who was on the phone, honey?

1653
01:12:46.085 --> 01:12:47.320
HENRIETTA: Luce.

1654
01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:49.288
She was supposed to take
me and my boyfriend

1655
01:12:49.423 --> 01:12:50.703
to the museum, but
now we're not.

1656
01:12:50.727 --> 01:12:53.860
Oh, uh... maybe some other time.

1657
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.194
Not for a while.

1658
01:12:55.294 --> 01:12:56.996
She's going on a
very long holiday.

1659
01:12:58.031 --> 01:12:59.442
She is?

1660
01:12:59.466 --> 01:13:02.168
When was the last time
you took me on holiday?

1661
01:13:02.268 --> 01:13:03.570
The summer of '94.

1662
01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.171
Great Barrier Reef.

1663
01:13:05.271 --> 01:13:07.173
You scared all the sharks away.

1664
01:13:07.273 --> 01:13:08.608
( Chuckles )

1665
01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:11.344
She didn't mention
that the other night.

1666
01:13:11.445 --> 01:13:13.456
No, yes, she did say
something, I remember now.

1667
01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.080
HENRIETTA: Will you
take me to the museum?

1668
01:13:15.104 --> 01:13:16.349
And can Heck come, too?

1669
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:17.884
Of course he can.

1670
01:13:17.984 --> 01:13:20.119
Do penguins have knees?

1671
01:13:20.219 --> 01:13:21.821
Well, this is fun, isn't it?

1672
01:13:21.921 --> 01:13:24.624
Shame it's only once a year.

I can't do it.

I thought I could,
but I can't do it.

1680

Blow out the candles, darling.
What's happening?

1681
01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.523
I'm going. It's good cake.

1682
01:13:47.547 --> 01:13:49.282
Your mother got the
recipe from this book

1683
01:13:49.382 --> 01:13:50.526
before she wrapped it.

1684
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:52.118
I'm not gonna leave you.

1685

that's exactly what you will do.

Will you kindly tell me
what you're talking about?

1688
01:13:56.623 --> 01:13:57.724
Why's Heck being sad?

1689
01:13:57.824 --> 01:13:59.058
HECK: It's not you leaving

1690
01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:00.494
that's gonna kill me.

1691
01:14:00.594 --> 01:14:03.129
It's you loving someone more.

1692
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:04.397
Sorry to interrupt.

1693
01:14:04.498 --> 01:14:06.299
Those candles are dripping wax

1694
01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:07.867
all over your mother's creation.

1695
01:14:07.967 --> 01:14:10.369
Will you fuck off with
the fucking candles!

1696
01:14:10.504 --> 01:14:12.138
( Iaughs )

1697
01:14:12.238 --> 01:14:14.574
Yeah. Yeah.

1698
01:14:16.643 --> 01:14:18.277
No, you're not walking away.

1699
01:14:18.377 --> 01:14:20.614
Don't-don't walk away from me.
Yeah, keep saying that.

1700
01:14:20.714 --> 01:14:22.525
Let me pretend
this is my choice.

1701
01:14:22.549 --> 01:14:24.560
What do you mean?
Oh, come on, Rach,

1702
01:14:24.584 --> 01:14:27.153
you both know you left
me in the end anyway.

1703
01:14:27.253 --> 01:14:31.157
That's not true. Yes, it is!

1704
01:14:33.527 --> 01:14:35.629
Yes, it is.

1705
01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:39.065
I want you to be happy.

1706
01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:44.838
More than anything else, I wanted to
be the cause of happiness in you.

1707
01:14:44.938 --> 01:14:46.439
But if I'm not,

1708
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:49.042
then...

1709
01:14:49.142 --> 01:14:51.377
I can't stand in the way.

1710
01:14:51.545 --> 01:14:54.047
Do you see?

1711
01:14:54.147 --> 01:14:58.618
Because what you're feeling now...
Rachel,

1712
01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:03.222
is the unstoppable force.

1713
01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:08.695
Which means that
I've got to move.

1714
01:15:24.377 --> 01:15:27.213
Darling, what did Heck mean

1715
01:15:27.313 --> 01:15:30.817
when he said you're in
love with someone else?

1716
01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:33.587
I am in love with someone else.

1717
01:15:33.687 --> 01:15:36.322
Cooper. That trollop.

1718
01:15:36.422 --> 01:15:38.291
He'd shag an open wound.

1719
01:15:38.391 --> 01:15:41.260
Not him.

1720
01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.638
Who, then?

1721
01:15:42.662 --> 01:15:44.330
Well, out with it.

1722
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:47.133
What's his name? Who
is the lucky chap?

1723
01:15:50.804 --> 01:15:54.608
Her name... is Luce.

1724
01:15:55.441 --> 01:15:57.777
Luce?

1725
01:15:57.877 --> 01:15:59.312
Yes.

1726
01:15:59.412 --> 01:16:02.515
Who's a woman.

1727
01:16:02.616 --> 01:16:05.151
As are you a woman.

1728
01:16:05.251 --> 01:16:07.186
That's right.

1729
01:16:07.286 --> 01:16:10.123
So the two of you are...

1730
01:16:10.223 --> 01:16:12.258
"lesbie" friends?

1731
01:16:12.358 --> 01:16:13.760
It doesn't matter
what you call it,

1732
01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:15.461
it's not going to happen.

1733
01:16:15.629 --> 01:16:17.263
Not after all this.

1734
01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:18.932
Quite bloody right.

1735
01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:20.499
Could I...

1736
01:16:20.634 --> 01:16:21.835
say something here?

1737
01:16:27.707 --> 01:16:31.110
When I first met your mother...

1738
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.312
back in the Trojan War...

1739
01:16:36.415 --> 01:16:38.484
I fell for her...

1740
01:16:38.652 --> 01:16:41.921
right off the bat.

1741
01:16:42.021 --> 01:16:47.293
And although she loved me
back, she married me...

1742
01:16:47.393 --> 01:16:52.708
somehow I always knew I was...

1743
01:16:52.732 --> 01:16:55.702
never quite up to snuff.

1744
01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.839
We muddled along,

1745
01:16:59.939 --> 01:17:03.109
got through the years,

1746
01:17:03.209 --> 01:17:08.014
but I never doubted that if she ever
met anyone she really fell for,

1747
01:17:08.114 --> 01:17:11.818
who made her realize
what true love is...

1748
01:17:13.753 --> 01:17:16.690
she'd leave me like a shot.

1749
01:17:17.757 --> 01:17:19.793
And how could I argue?

1750
01:17:22.228 --> 01:17:25.598
Whatever you choose
to do from here,

1751
01:17:25.699 --> 01:17:28.802
we'll support you;
we always will.

1752
01:17:28.902 --> 01:17:32.739
But please, my darling...

1753
01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:35.141
follow your heart.

1754
01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.576
Can I borrow your car?

1755
01:17:37.711 --> 01:17:39.045
I'll drive you.

1756
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.316
( Quietly ): Nothing
happens without me there.

1757
01:17:47.586 --> 01:17:49.288
You coming?

1758
01:17:51.725 --> 01:17:54.060
When we come back,
we'll talk about this

1759
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.594
if you want to.

1760
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:57.563
Yeah.

1761
01:17:57.731 --> 01:18:00.533
Do you know what I wish?

1762
01:18:00.633 --> 01:18:02.869
You wouldn't grow up so fast.

1763
01:18:08.541 --> 01:18:11.945
( Engine idling nearby )

1764
01:18:14.513 --> 01:18:15.749
You take care, then.

1765
01:18:15.849 --> 01:18:17.316
You take care.

1766
01:18:17.416 --> 01:18:18.584
I'm going to enjoy myself.

1767
01:18:18.752 --> 01:18:21.187
( Chuckles )

1768
01:18:21.287 --> 01:18:22.488
Hey.

1769
01:18:22.588 --> 01:18:24.323
You did nothing wrong.

1770
01:18:24.423 --> 01:18:27.593
I did.

1771
01:18:27.761 --> 01:18:29.763
Truth is, I'd do it again.

1772
01:19:09.068 --> 01:19:11.971
HENRIETTA: Why don't you have
pudding after breakfast?

1773
01:19:12.071 --> 01:19:14.040
You have it after
lunch and dinner,

1774
01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:16.109
so why not in the
morning, as well?

1775
01:19:16.209 --> 01:19:19.645
I think it weird.

1776
01:19:19.813 --> 01:19:22.816
You're still sad, aren't you?

1777
01:19:24.017 --> 01:19:26.652
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1778
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.521
I knew you would be.

1779
01:19:28.621 --> 01:19:31.424
I bought you sweets.

1780
01:19:31.524 --> 01:19:33.526
Thank you.

1781
01:19:33.626 --> 01:19:35.829
Great.

1782
01:19:35.929 --> 01:19:37.840
I didn't know which
is your favorite,

1783
01:19:37.864 --> 01:19:39.498
so I bought pick mix.

1784
01:19:41.835 --> 01:19:44.037
( Sobbing )

1785
01:19:45.638 --> 01:19:50.143
Oh, sorry, H. Sorry.

1786
01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:52.011
It's just, um...

1787
01:19:52.111 --> 01:19:54.981
I'm trying to do the
right thing, and, um...

1788
01:19:56.749 --> 01:19:59.218
and now I think I
should have not.

1789
01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.057
'Cause... if she'd stayed
with me out of guilt,

1790
01:20:04.157 --> 01:20:06.592
that would have been
fine, wouldn't it?

1791
01:20:06.692 --> 01:20:07.726
I mean, wouldn't it?

1792
01:20:07.861 --> 01:20:11.364
My math teacher, Mrs. Latracy,

1793
01:20:11.464 --> 01:20:14.834
has something she always
says when people are sad.

1794
01:20:14.934 --> 01:20:16.702
She says no problem
isn't soluble

1798
01:20:24.043 --> 01:20:25.544
( Iaughing ): I don't know.

1799
01:20:25.644 --> 01:20:27.546
She's a bit unusual.

1800
01:20:28.714 --> 01:20:30.549
I should have married you.

1801
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:32.118
Maybe in ten years.

1802
01:20:32.218 --> 01:20:34.954
If you're still lonely, we
could get married then.

1803

1804
01:20:36.455 --> 01:20:38.925
You know, it's funny.

1805
01:20:39.025 --> 01:20:41.227
Ever since we first
met, I was...

1806
01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:43.429
scared that she was
going to leave me.

1807
01:20:43.529 --> 01:20:45.731
You shouldn't be afraid, Heck.

1808
01:20:45.831 --> 01:20:48.167
You can do anything.

1813

there must be other
fish in the sea.

1814

1815
01:21:04.417 --> 01:21:06.619
Is it straight on? Yes.

1816
01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:07.720
It's rather exciting.

1817
01:21:07.820 --> 01:21:08.940

1818
01:21:09.022 --> 01:21:10.289
Who will be providing them?

1819
01:21:10.389 --> 01:21:12.258

marvelous new invention,

1820
01:21:12.358 --> 01:21:13.726
somewhat akin to
the turkey baster.

1821

01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:19.565
Hey, where did you two meet?

1823

At my wedding.

1824

happening that fast.

Hello.

I left him.

1840
01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.039
