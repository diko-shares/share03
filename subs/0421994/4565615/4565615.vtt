1
00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:29.985
I want something that says,
"I'm sorry he's dead..."

2
00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:31.988
"but not that sorry."

3
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.117
"He was just a dog and you shouldn't
have loved him more than me."

4
00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:38.987
Can you do me a bunch that says that?

5
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.795
Rachel, darling,
tell your father he can't wear that suit.

6
00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:46.335
He looks nice.

7
00:01:47.238 --> 00:01:49.729
- You look nice.
- Thank you, poppet.

8
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:51.206
Seen better-dressed crab.

9
00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:52.435
I have a question.

10
00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:54.807
Oh, God, will somebody please put
a gag on my daughter?

11
00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:56.607
Why is the alphabet in that order?

12
00:01:56.714 --> 00:02:01.014
Nobody knows, nobody cares. So, for once
in your little life, would you just...

13
00:02:03.388 --> 00:02:04.719
What do you think?

14
00:02:05.156 --> 00:02:08.648
- Holy wow.
- Oh, darling.

15
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.318
You look like a meringue.

16
00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:13.021
Good.

17
00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.532
- You're late.
- Balls.

18
00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:17.999
- What's the job?
- Wedding.

19
00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:20.002
- You always pull.
- One of us has to.

20
00:02:20.104 --> 00:02:21.696
- Nice couple?
- Haven't met them.

21
00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:24.498
- All about the mother.
- Isn't it always?

22
00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:26.603
- Come out with me afterwards.
- Sure.

23
00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:28.474
- You will?
- Absolutely.

24
00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.140
- Oh, cool. Well, we'll go together.
- I'll meet you there.

25
00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:35.352
- You're not coming.
- My favorite advert's on TV.

26
00:02:35.453 --> 00:02:38.684
- You need a love life.
- I have a "like" life. It suits me fine.

27
00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:41.787
No, I feel good, actually, bizarrely good.

28
00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:44.691
Yeah, yeah, no nerves at all.
None whatsoever. Thanks.

29
00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:46.553
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Hi.

30
00:02:46.898 --> 00:02:48.593
- Hi.
- You're Hector, right, the groom?

31
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.668
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call me Heck.

32
00:02:50.768 --> 00:02:53.236
- Well, I did your flowers.
- Oh, did you?

33
00:02:53.438 --> 00:02:55.804
Oh, well, they're fabulous.
Aren't they, Coop?

34
00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:59.934
Fabulous, yeah. Although, I wouldn't know
a nice flower from a poke in the eye.

35
00:03:00.044 --> 00:03:01.644
But they're fabulous, aren't they, Coop?

36
00:03:04.115 --> 00:03:07.243
So, Ned, how long
have you guys been married, then?

37
00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:08.452
Thirty years.

38
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:12.888
If I'd killed her when I first thought
about it, I'd be out by now.

39
00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:15.017
A free man.

40
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:20.563
I remember all the way to the church
I just wanted to shout...

41
00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:24.567
"Stop the car! This is a horrible mistake."

42
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.762
But you can't, can you?

43
00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:32.742
So, you just sit there, say nothing...

44
00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:37.679
as the wheels keep turning,
leading you on to the longest sentence...

45
00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:40.444
Stop the car! I forgot to pee.

46
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:52.058
All right, panic over.

47
00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:53.221
They're here now.

48
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:56.095
- Good luck, chum.
- All right, Tessa? You all right?

49
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:57.895
- Hi, Heck.
- Hi, babe.

50
00:03:58.002 --> 00:03:59.402
You want some help with this thing?

51
00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:00.797
Yes.

52
00:04:01.305 --> 00:04:02.897
I do work out, yes.

53
00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:05.235
- Don't have a six-pack.
- No?

54
00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:09.677
- No, 12-pack on this puppy.
- I don't really like men with muscles.

55
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:13.273
The bonus is, though, I'm very...
I'm very sensitive, too.

56
00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:14.812
Heck, I've got a question.

57
00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.919
Not now.

58
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.020
What's the question, H?

59
00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:20.489
What happens when an unstoppable force
meets a immovable object?

60
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:25.001
I haven't got a bastard clue, I'm afraid.

61
00:04:25.329 --> 00:04:27.741
There you are, you see.
Now we can let him get married in peace.

62
00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:30.495
It never happens.
If there's a thing that can't be stopped...

63
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:35.163
it's not possible for there to be something
else which can't be moved, and vice versa.

64
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.739
They can't both exist.
You see, it's a trick question...

65
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.210
is the answer.

66
00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:42.277
Can she sit with me?

67
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.580
- So what am I doing here?
- When do fish sleep?

68
00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:54.223
- She's coming round, is she?
- She is coming.

69
00:04:54.725 --> 00:04:56.488
Of course she is.

70
00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:57.627
Yep.

71
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.429
When? When's she coming?

72
00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:03.125
- What's your name, anyway?
- Everyone calls me "H."

73
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.733
They tell me it's short for Henrietta,
but it's not.

74
00:05:05.837 --> 00:05:08.032
It's short for Jesus "H" Christ.

75
00:05:08.573 --> 00:05:11.474
That's what my mummy said when she
found out she was pregnant with me.

76
00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:13.568
Isn't Heck handsome?

77
00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:17.212
- I fancy that flower girl.
- Yeah, yeah, I know you do.

78
00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:21.412
She likes me, right?
I got a vibe that she likes me.

79
00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.983
Coop, it's my wedding day.
Can we talk about me?

80
00:05:24.088 --> 00:05:25.316
Sure, yes.

81
00:05:29.694 --> 00:05:31.491
Did you get the vibe
that she likes me?

82
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.134
Right, last one to the altar's a sissy.

83
00:05:46.677 --> 00:05:50.408
- Well, this is it.
- Wish me luck.

84
00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.375
Wish you luck?

85
00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:55.316
It's a wedding.
Bridesmaids always blow weddings.

86
00:05:55.453 --> 00:05:57.284
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

87
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.850
She's here.

88
00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:06.922
Okay, you're sorted.
I'm gonna set up the reception.

89
00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:08.763
Excuse me.

90
00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:50.169
- All good?
- Always.

91
00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:56.043
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

92
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.142
and in the face of this congregation...

93
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.481
You look beautiful.
To join together this man...

94
00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:05.920
and this woman in holy matrimony.

95
00:07:08.092 --> 00:07:09.821
Congratulations!

96
00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:36.477
Please keep your arms by your side.
It's like dancing with a gibbon.

97
00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:38.248
Nothing.

98
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.220
Nothing.

99
00:07:45.262 --> 00:07:46.524
Over here!

100
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:55.798
- Hi.
- Hi.

101
00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:00.909
- We haven't met. I'm Luce.
- Rachel.

102
00:08:01.746 --> 00:08:05.705
- I did your flowers.
- You did? My flowers are nice.

103
00:08:06.317 --> 00:08:07.557
Anyway, I was just gonna get...

104
00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:10.681
a drink.

105
00:08:11.989 --> 00:08:12.989
I wouldn't.

106
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:17.222
What, is there something wrong?
I'm here to help.

107
00:08:18.863 --> 00:08:21.957
My ring. I was getting some
of this punch crap and...

108
00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:24.567
- Your wedding ring?
- It fell off.

109
00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:28.199
Off and in there.
My wedding ring is in there.

110
00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:30.937
- And you tried the ladle?
- Nothing.

111
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:32.532
- And you can't empty...
- No.

112
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:34.270
No, it's too big.

113
00:08:34.378 --> 00:08:38.314
- Right. Only one thing to do. Cover me.
- What?

114
00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.642
Use the dress. I'm going in.

115
00:08:40.785 --> 00:08:43.447
You can't just... Oh, yes, really, you can.

116
00:08:46.257 --> 00:08:47.257
Hi.

117
00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:49.688
They say white's the color of virgins.

118
00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:52.474
If I know Hector, the only thing virgin
round here is the olive oil.

119
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.230
The old jokes really are the best,
aren't they?

120
00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:58.301
I'm Rob. Hector works underneath me,
but not in the biblical sense.

121
00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:00.603
You're just like he described.

122
00:09:01.439 --> 00:09:04.840
Now, I need booze.
I've just met a cracking filly...

123
00:09:04.942 --> 00:09:06.933
thought I'd grease the passage,
so to speak.

124
00:09:07.511 --> 00:09:09.342
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:09:09.447 --> 00:09:13.008
- This is Luce. She's a florist.
- Name's Rob.

126
00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:15.915
- But you can call me anything you'd like.
- And I'm sure I will.

127
00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:31.866
Mac, can you do me a favor and give me
something that's soft and smooth, yeah?

128
00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:55.556
Hey, H, H. Why don't you go visit with
your friends, they all miss you.

129
00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:56.785
Okay.

130
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.689
Our turn for this dance, I think.

131
00:10:07.004 --> 00:10:09.529
- We fit nice, don't we, together?
- Yes.

132
00:10:09.807 --> 00:10:12.742
Let me just come... Oh, that's...

133
00:10:13.377 --> 00:10:16.346
- You okay?
- Yep. Bit tight there, Coop.

134
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.675
I lost my virginity to this song.

135
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:27.750
I love dancing with you.

136
00:10:29.293 --> 00:10:30.817
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

137
00:10:32.263 --> 00:10:35.130
<i>Is this... Is this thing...
Is this thing on?</i>

138
00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:37.593
Cooper, there you are.

139
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:40.261
Get this berk off the microphone
and make a proper speech.

140
00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:42.235
<i>Unaccustomed...</i>

141
00:10:42.573 --> 00:10:46.009
What are you doing?
<i>As I am, to public speaking.</i>

142
00:10:46.744 --> 00:10:48.211
Problem now.

143
00:10:48.746 --> 00:10:51.715
<i>Anyway, these guys are in love...</i>

144
00:10:51.816 --> 00:10:55.217
<i>and I think that that's boring.</i>

145
00:10:57.354 --> 00:11:00.152
<i>They've been in love for years, years!</i>

146
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:04.186
<i>Years that have seen endless amounts
of drugs consumed...</i>

147
00:11:04.495 --> 00:11:08.693
<i>and meaningless sex
thoroughly enjoyed by me!</i>

148
00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:11.290
<i>They just stayed at home, as they do.</i>

149
00:11:11.402 --> 00:11:13.563
<i>They've been like a married couple
for so many years...</i>

150
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:15.662
<i>it's a relief that they're finally married.</i>

151
00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:19.869
<i>So, before I do my duty as best man
and shag a bridesmaid...</i>

152
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.409
<i>you know who you are...</i>

153
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:25.742
<i>I would like to raise a glass
to Rachel and Hector.</i>

154
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.647
<i>May they grow old together
sharing the same pillow.</i>

155
00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:31.279
<i>Rachel and Hector.</i>

156
00:11:31.388 --> 00:11:33.583
Rachel and Hector.

157
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:38.652
<i>Oh, and, now, this is a very big deal.</i>

158
00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:42.091
<i>Some say the reason it's taken him
this long to get married is his fear...</i>

159
00:11:42.199 --> 00:11:44.963
<i>of making just this speech,
but he's making it now!</i>

160
00:11:45.069 --> 00:11:47.697
<i>He's not sure he can do it,
I know he can do it.</i>

161
00:11:47.805 --> 00:11:51.798
<i>Please put it together repeatedly,
here's Hecky!</i>

162
00:12:15.065 --> 00:12:18.796
I know something that helps, Hector.
Imagine everybody naked.

163
00:12:24.942 --> 00:12:27.410
<i>Hi, everyone. I'm Heck...</i>

164
00:12:28.512 --> 00:12:30.480
<i>and welcome to my wedding.</i>

165
00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:35.251
<i>So, I'm glad you're all here
looking at me because...</i>

166
00:12:36.153 --> 00:12:39.611
<i>'cause I want to tell you
how much I love Rachel.</i>

167
00:12:40.557 --> 00:12:45.051
<i>What an amazing, wonderful,
uniquely fantastic person she is.</i>

168
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:50.431
- Do you want to keep going?
- No, no, I think you're doing great.

169
00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.497
<i>Okay, so this is me now.</i>

170
00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:57.766
<i>I've been looking forward
to this day all my life.</i>

171
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.812
<i>And I'm glad to share it
with so many people I love...</i>

172
00:13:04.782 --> 00:13:06.342
<i>and a few people I've never met before.</i>

173
00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:09.209
<i>But I'm sure you're all great, too.</i>

174
00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:17.894
<i>I feel like I've known Heck all my life. And
I know I'll know him for the rest of it.</i>

175
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.092
<i>He's my best friend.</i>

176
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.737
<i>They say fairytales have happy endings,
even though the passage can be rough.</i>

177
00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:31.971
<i>But Heck and I were mates
and then lovers.</i>

178
00:13:33.143 --> 00:13:34.633
<i>And it's been smooth all the way.</i>

179
00:13:37.915 --> 00:13:39.883
<i>Maybe that's a better kind of fairytale.</i>

180
00:13:40.217 --> 00:13:41.650
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear!

181
00:13:41.752 --> 00:13:43.720
<i>Sort of, toast-schmoast won't do all that.</i>

182
00:13:43.821 --> 00:13:47.587
<i>But if you could all just wish us luck,
Heck and I would appreciate it very much.</i>

183
00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:48.988
<i>All ready?</i>

184
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.657
<i>One, two, three.</i>

185
00:13:52.796 --> 00:13:54.058
<i>Good luck!</i>

186
00:14:19.823 --> 00:14:21.120
- Hello.
- Hi.

187
00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:25.161
You gotta help me. I need a flower.
Just one. A good one. The best.

188
00:14:25.262 --> 00:14:27.457
- Okay.
- This is my last chance.

189
00:14:27.564 --> 00:14:29.794
- My last-chance flower.
- Your last chance?

190
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.663
I really twatted up.

191
00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:34.499
Only the right flower can save me.
What about a rose?

192
00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:36.402
- A red rose, what would that say?
- Love.

193
00:14:36.507 --> 00:14:38.839
- Love's nice, that works.
- And fidelity.

194
00:14:38.942 --> 00:14:41.103
- Not a red rose, then.
- No.

195
00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:42.940
Not a rose at all. It's too obvious.

196
00:14:43.047 --> 00:14:46.574
If this really is your last chance, we need
to find you something spectacular.

197
00:14:49.119 --> 00:14:51.144
- Be right with you.
- That's fine.

198
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:54.380
- Hi.
- Hey.

199
00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:56.419
- How you doing?
- Good.

200
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.920
Great. I just...

201
00:14:58.028 --> 00:14:59.461
See what's out here.

202
00:15:01.331 --> 00:15:04.164
- Came by to say thanks.
- It was a total pleasure.

203
00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:09.272
- Listen, sorry, I'm just dealing with...
- Oh, God, of course. Go right ahead.

204
00:15:09.373 --> 00:15:10.567
What's your favorite flower?

205
00:15:12.242 --> 00:15:14.301
I don't know. I think I like lilies.

206
00:15:15.112 --> 00:15:16.340
They're wrong.

207
00:15:18.315 --> 00:15:22.752
- How about this? Bird of paradise.
- Keep talking.

208
00:15:22.853 --> 00:15:25.981
Real name's Strelitzia,
named after Charlotte of Strelitz.

209
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.924
She married King George III, had 15 kids.
They never spent more than an hour apart.

210
00:15:30.027 --> 00:15:31.517
- Okay, stop talking.
- He actually...

211
00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:34.463
- Do you want to come to dinner?
- Sorry?

212
00:15:34.898 --> 00:15:37.196
Dinner with us, Heck and me.

213
00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:40.109
- I mean, you don't...
- I'd love to.

214
00:15:40.604 --> 00:15:45.371
- Really? This Friday?
- Yeah, Friday. Why not?

215
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.570
Great, I'll just write down the...

216
00:15:47.644 --> 00:15:49.134
Perfect.

217
00:15:49.847 --> 00:15:53.749
This is the one. My last-chance flower.

218
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:55.978
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

219
00:15:58.455 --> 00:16:03.290
<i>Next item, lot 48,
the 1930s American oak mantle clock.</i>

220
00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:07.090
<i>Here at £48. At £48.</i>

221
00:16:07.397 --> 00:16:09.957
<i>£50. Thank you. Lady bid £50.
Lady bid £50.</i>

222
00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:12.763
Okay, baby, now you got to glare,
give out the red eye.

223
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.647
I'd do it, it's just that you're
a lot more frightening.

224
00:16:14.671 --> 00:16:15.729
No, I'm not.

225
00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:18.706
- Who am I glaring at?
- Anyone who wants that sofa.

226
00:16:18.842 --> 00:16:20.673
- They can't have it, it's mine.
- Ours.

227
00:16:20.777 --> 00:16:23.575
- Ours?
- If it's under the limit, £200.

228
00:16:23.847 --> 00:16:27.749
- I don't see how we need a limit.
- I like limits, otherwise, you'll go mad.

229
00:16:27.851 --> 00:16:29.371
Damn right I will. That thing is mine.

230
00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:30.987
Ours.

231
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:33.709
Do you think
they'll have a limit?

232
00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:36.456
<i>£75. £75...</i>

233
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.825
I invited someone to dinner, Friday.
That florist, Luce.

234
00:16:39.997 --> 00:16:41.897
- Lucy, whatever.
- Oh, great, I'll cook.

235
00:16:42.032 --> 00:16:43.056
Please don't.

236
00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:45.692
<i>- Moving right along. Lot 49.</i>
- Okay, baby, this is us.

237
00:16:45.802 --> 00:16:48.464
<i>The very attractive leather sofa, there.</i>

238
00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:51.703
<i>Brown leather chesterfield,
brass stud decoration...</i>

239
00:16:51.808 --> 00:16:54.333
<i>in slightly distressed condition at £90.</i>

240
00:16:54.444 --> 00:16:56.435
I asked because... And this is my plan.

241
00:16:56.547 --> 00:16:58.606
- Oh, no.
- I thought we'd get Coop along.

242
00:16:58.715 --> 00:17:01.394
Great idea. Excellent. But what would be
better is if we didn't do that.

243
00:17:01.418 --> 00:17:03.283
<i>£90. Do I hear £90?</i>

244
00:17:03.387 --> 00:17:06.049
Not from us. Come in late.
Psych them on the way out.

245
00:17:06.156 --> 00:17:09.523
I think they'd be perfect for each other.
Don't you think they'd be perfect?

246
00:17:09.626 --> 00:17:12.288
<i>£100, £100. £110, thank you.</i>

247
00:17:12.396 --> 00:17:14.227
Red eye, baby. Still the red eye. Who?

248
00:17:14.331 --> 00:17:16.265
Luce and Coop. I think they'd be perfect.

249
00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:19.824
<i>£120. £130, thank you.</i>

250
00:17:19.937 --> 00:17:22.415
He did say that he was onto a
promise at the wedding before she bailed.

251
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:24.304
There you go. It's totally on.

252
00:17:24.408 --> 00:17:26.603
<i>- £150 at the back.</i>
- Okay.

253
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.102
It's funny.

254
00:17:28.412 --> 00:17:31.973
I went round to say thank you
for what she did at our wedding.

255
00:17:32.082 --> 00:17:33.276
Not yet.

256
00:17:33.383 --> 00:17:35.783
You know when you've just met someone
but straight away...

257
00:17:35.886 --> 00:17:38.286
you feel as if they're going
to be your friend?

258
00:17:38.388 --> 00:17:40.822
<i>- £170, £180.</i>
- Nearly there.

259
00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:44.290
Who knows why? Past life, physiognomy.

260
00:17:44.394 --> 00:17:45.622
<i>£190.</i>

261
00:17:46.163 --> 00:17:48.324
But for some reason, you
just kind of click.

262
00:17:48.432 --> 00:17:49.432
Here we go.

263
00:17:49.533 --> 00:17:51.899
<i>£210? £210.</i>

264
00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:54.536
<i>- £210.</i>
- Bollocks.

265
00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:56.449
I don't know what I'm saying.
But do you know what I mean?

266
00:17:56.473 --> 00:17:57.684
<i>Are we there at £210, all done at £210?</i>

267
00:17:57.708 --> 00:17:59.642
Baby, we lost it. The sofa.

268
00:18:00.143 --> 00:18:02.236
- What?
- Over our limit.

269
00:18:02.346 --> 00:18:03.608
£400!

270
00:18:05.916 --> 00:18:07.110
<i>£400?</i>

271
00:18:21.431 --> 00:18:24.798
- What are you doing?
- I live here. What are you doing?

272
00:18:25.402 --> 00:18:26.960
Came to tidy.

273
00:18:27.704 --> 00:18:29.262
You should be dressed, Mum.

274
00:18:29.373 --> 00:18:32.536
Well, I was.
I'm just settling in for the evening.

275
00:18:32.643 --> 00:18:35.942
It's 5:00.
You said you were going out later.

276
00:18:36.046 --> 00:18:38.674
No, you said I was going out later.

277
00:18:40.617 --> 00:18:43.677
- Have you finished work already?
- I'm busy tonight.

278
00:18:44.855 --> 00:18:48.621
What, a date?
Does my daughter have a date?

279
00:18:49.326 --> 00:18:51.988
No. But you could have.

280
00:18:57.934 --> 00:19:02.871
"Tea dances, reading groups,
bridge clubs."

281
00:19:04.274 --> 00:19:07.038
Tragic attempts
by lonely old coffin dodgers...

282
00:19:07.144 --> 00:19:10.341
to meet someone before they give up
and peg out.

283
00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:12.572
Everybody looking for love.

284
00:19:12.683 --> 00:19:15.584
Well, they won't find it,
and they certainly won't get sex.

285
00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:19.588
All those men are so old,
it'd be like playing snooker with a rope.

286
00:19:22.492 --> 00:19:23.857
You know, those people are sad.

287
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.587
- You're sad.
- No.

288
00:19:26.129 --> 00:19:28.461
I'm depressed. There's a difference.

289
00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:30.926
I wish you'd get a life.

290
00:19:33.603 --> 00:19:34.603
I wish you would.

291
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.934
Yes, I know you do.

292
00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:42.410
Toby, I'm telling you, that's the number.
You've gotta believe me.

293
00:19:42.512 --> 00:19:46.107
Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that.
We're friends. Aren't we friends?

294
00:19:46.216 --> 00:19:50.380
Well, I like you. Look,
would you believe it if Heck told you?

295
00:19:50.487 --> 00:19:52.887
You would? Thank you very much.

296
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.280
Hey, Toby.

297
00:19:55.959 --> 00:19:59.087
Yeah, I know.
Weird, but believe him, okay?

298
00:19:59.596 --> 00:20:01.496
Okay. Speak to you soon.

299
00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:04.026
All good.

300
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:09.063
- You see, the truth never fails.
- Yeah, except we were lying.

301
00:20:12.342 --> 00:20:13.342
Hmm.

302
00:20:16.246 --> 00:20:18.043
Sorry I'm late, beautiful person.

303
00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:21.881
- You look spectacular.
- How was work?

304
00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:24.484
Shite. Quitting.

305
00:20:25.088 --> 00:20:26.180
You always say that.

306
00:20:26.289 --> 00:20:28.655
Just watch me. One day, I'll do it.

307
00:20:29.192 --> 00:20:33.822
Tell them I don't like them or their cash.
Although I do like their cash.

308
00:20:34.164 --> 00:20:38.260
Whatever. I'll think of something
and then walk out.

309
00:20:39.503 --> 00:20:41.095
I'll be waiting with champagne.

310
00:20:42.072 --> 00:20:43.752
How much do I wish it was just us tonight.

311
00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.899
He'll definitely be into her, right?

312
00:20:46.009 --> 00:20:49.172
- Coop? He'll fancy Luce?
- She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

313
00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:53.215
No, but, I mean... You do. You would?

314
00:20:53.316 --> 00:20:57.343
Well, she's not really my bag of chips,
darling, but, yeah, I suppose.

315
00:20:58.488 --> 00:21:02.322
- Oh, what do you think?
- Of her? I haven't really...

316
00:21:02.426 --> 00:21:04.121
Oh, no, no. The shirt?

317
00:21:05.429 --> 00:21:06.429
Oh, uh...

318
00:21:06.863 --> 00:21:09.957
- It's gorgeous. You're gorgeous.
- Yeah?

319
00:21:10.534 --> 00:21:12.399
Want to fool around?

320
00:21:14.304 --> 00:21:17.330
Saved by the bell.
But you're in a lot of trouble later.

321
00:21:20.444 --> 00:21:21.638
- Hey.
- Hey.

322
00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:25.506
- Come in. You look fab.
- Thank you.

323
00:21:25.615 --> 00:21:29.016
- Guess what I brought?
- Oh, bless you. Rachel will flip.

324
00:21:29.219 --> 00:21:31.244
- Sweetheart.
- Here I am.

325
00:21:32.189 --> 00:21:33.622
- Hey.
- Hi.

326
00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:38.687
- So, come check out our new sofa.
- Our expensive new sofa.

327
00:21:38.795 --> 00:21:42.231
- You can't put a price on comfort.
- You see, a woman after my own heart.

328
00:21:42.332 --> 00:21:43.932
Listen, do you believe in reincarnation?

329
00:21:44.034 --> 00:21:47.162
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

330
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:51.036
- That's not quite what I...
- I'd have remembered, I think.

331
00:21:51.908 --> 00:21:54.934
Well, let's hang these flowers
and get that jacket in some water.

332
00:21:55.045 --> 00:21:56.307
- I'll do it.
- Ta.

333
00:21:58.515 --> 00:21:59.715
- Thanks.
- Thank you, darling.

334
00:21:59.749 --> 00:22:02.582
Well, so, basically,
the book I've wanted to write is...

335
00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:06.315
a guide to wherever is the coolest place
on the planet at the time.

336
00:22:06.423 --> 00:22:08.550
If it's February, it's the Rio Carnival.

337
00:22:08.658 --> 00:22:12.594
And if it's, I don't know, May,
it's bulls in Pamplona.

338
00:22:12.696 --> 00:22:14.323
So, if you...

339
00:22:14.431 --> 00:22:18.925
want a holiday /party, then,
you know, you open the book...

340
00:22:19.035 --> 00:22:20.595
and there's me telling you where to go.

341
00:22:20.637 --> 00:22:22.195
'Cause you've been there.

342
00:22:22.305 --> 00:22:25.331
Yeah, that was the plan, but, you know...

343
00:22:25.642 --> 00:22:28.941
Rach, life, work.

344
00:22:29.813 --> 00:22:31.474
- Rach.
- Some day.

345
00:22:31.882 --> 00:22:33.315
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

346
00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:37.612
Anyway, how about you? Married?

347
00:22:38.054 --> 00:22:39.851
Ever been married,
ever gonna be married?

348
00:22:39.956 --> 00:22:42.982
No. No.
Maybe now the laws have changed.

349
00:22:43.193 --> 00:22:44.553
- How do you mean?
- Well, I'm gay.

350
00:22:47.964 --> 00:22:49.056
Mmm.

351
00:22:49.699 --> 00:22:52.224
Lovely. Well done.

352
00:22:58.208 --> 00:23:01.302
- That'll be Cooper.
- Cooper's coming.

353
00:23:02.679 --> 00:23:03.805
Yeah.

354
00:23:09.653 --> 00:23:10.745
Mmm.

355
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:12.221
Heck?

356
00:23:12.622 --> 00:23:15.614
- This is absolutely revolting.
- You think so?

357
00:23:15.725 --> 00:23:18.057
It is, sweetheart. It's atrocious.

358
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:21.392
Anyway, more importantly, listen.
It's been three weeks now.

359
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:24.495
Let's have it.
How much better is sex after marriage?

360
00:23:24.601 --> 00:23:26.364
- Please.
- Because, when I've had sex...

361
00:23:26.469 --> 00:23:30.132
with people after they were married,
they have said that it's fantastic.

362
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.107
- Rach?
- Get wed and find out yourself.

363
00:23:33.209 --> 00:23:34.620
Come on, Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.

364
00:23:34.644 --> 00:23:36.422
We're talking about two or three years
of his life.

365
00:23:36.446 --> 00:23:37.936
Well, not a one-person person.

366
00:23:38.048 --> 00:23:39.592
You really don't think
your other half's out there?

367
00:23:39.616 --> 00:23:42.312
- Or, you know, in here?
- Actually, Rach...

368
00:23:42.419 --> 00:23:43.863
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

369
00:23:43.887 --> 00:23:47.288
Yes, there are, and I'm trying to
sleep with as many as I can.

370
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.823
And you never fail, do you?

371
00:23:48.925 --> 00:23:51.005
You know, they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

372
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.461
It'll all change when you meet Miss Right.

373
00:23:55.565 --> 00:23:57.362
And how am I supposed to know
when I do that?

374
00:23:57.467 --> 00:24:00.163
You don't know, not straight away.
It just feels...

375
00:24:02.238 --> 00:24:04.365
warm and comfortable...

376
00:24:04.474 --> 00:24:08.604
and you hang in there and give it a chance,
before you know it, you're like...

377
00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:11.476
"Yeah, this is it. Must be love."

378
00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:14.915
- Yeah, I'm with her.
- I'm with her, too. Give me that.

379
00:24:15.318 --> 00:24:17.047
I don't agree.

380
00:24:17.354 --> 00:24:20.482
I think you know immediately.
You know, as soon as your eyes...

381
00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:24.518
Then everything that happens
from then on, just proves...

382
00:24:24.628 --> 00:24:26.994
that you had been right
in that first moment.

383
00:24:27.097 --> 00:24:30.294
When you suddenly realized you had
been incomplete and now you are whole.

384
00:24:32.836 --> 00:24:35.236
- Actually, I'm with her, I'd say.
- I'm with her, too.

385
00:24:35.338 --> 00:24:37.704
Sorted. So, who's for pudding?

386
00:24:37.807 --> 00:24:39.104
- Yes.
- No.

387
00:24:39.209 --> 00:24:40.301
- No?
- No.

388
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.902
If you think that, you think that
everyone that doesn't have all that...

389
00:24:45.448 --> 00:24:47.211
business is settling for less.

390
00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:50.411
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That kind of is what you're saying.

391
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.800
I think she said it a bit nicer.

392
00:24:53.289 --> 00:24:54.449
Trifle?

393
00:24:55.859 --> 00:24:58.384
You look tired, chief.
You have a good day at work?

394
00:24:58.495 --> 00:25:01.589
- Shite. I'm quitting.
- Did you check out flower girl back there?

395
00:25:01.698 --> 00:25:02.960
Made that speech for me.

396
00:25:03.066 --> 00:25:05.534
Later on tonight,
we're gonna fall madly in bed.

397
00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:08.195
- Oh, it's going well for you guys?
- It's going very well.

398
00:25:11.174 --> 00:25:12.436
She's a lesbian.

399
00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:17.573
Is that right? Cool.

400
00:25:17.681 --> 00:25:20.445
You don't think that slightly impedes
your plans for seduction?

401
00:25:21.317 --> 00:25:22.477
Anyone can change teams.

402
00:25:25.722 --> 00:25:28.919
Not anyone. I wouldn't...
'Cause, you know... But anyone, I mean...

403
00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:43.028
What are you doing?

404
00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:48.469
- It's gorgeous.
- It's raining.

405
00:25:51.114 --> 00:25:52.706
Heck won't come up here.

406
00:25:53.083 --> 00:25:55.261
They say it's subconscious fear
you'll throw yourself off...

407
00:25:55.285 --> 00:25:58.152
but he freaks when I go near the edge, too.

408
00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:02.391
Sorry about dinner.

409
00:26:04.427 --> 00:26:05.951
I've eaten worse.

410
00:26:07.964 --> 00:26:11.400
- Kind of went off.
- You didn't go off.

411
00:26:13.002 --> 00:26:14.936
You went a little way off.

412
00:26:18.007 --> 00:26:19.634
- You're wet.
- I'm fine.

413
00:26:19.743 --> 00:26:21.438
- And you're cold.
- I'm fine!

414
00:26:21.544 --> 00:26:23.944
- You can have it. Really, you can have it.
- I'm so fine.

415
00:26:24.047 --> 00:26:25.458
- It's fine. Well...
- Okay, now you're cold.

416
00:26:25.482 --> 00:26:27.143
Hey, what are you guys up to?

417
00:26:28.284 --> 00:26:29.376
Nothing.

418
00:26:29.586 --> 00:26:32.316
Well, Coop wants to play
strip poker or strip Cooper...

419
00:26:32.422 --> 00:26:34.322
and I really want him to go home.

420
00:26:35.058 --> 00:26:36.821
- Good night.
- See you soon.

421
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.121
- Two.
- Thanks for dinner.

422
00:26:39.696 --> 00:26:40.696
Bye.

423
00:26:42.432 --> 00:26:43.456
Cheers, Coop.

424
00:26:50.673 --> 00:26:53.005
- Next left.
- It's one option, yes.

425
00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:55.407
How about instead, we just go
straight back to my place?

426
00:26:55.512 --> 00:26:57.036
Coop, take the next left.

427
00:26:58.515 --> 00:27:01.814
- You all right, Luce?
- Why, 'cause I don't want to shag you?

428
00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:07.380
You're welcome not to shag me, just don't
sit in my car all bored like that.

429
00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:11.723
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:12.862 --> 00:27:13.920
Really.

431
00:27:15.431 --> 00:27:17.763
You've got something on your mind,
that's obvious.

432
00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:23.396
You know what you should do?
You should share with me.

433
00:27:24.607 --> 00:27:27.405
Because beneath this rugged exterior...

434
00:27:28.278 --> 00:27:29.745
there beats a sensitive soul.

435
00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:33.145
- No, there doesn't.
- No, there doesn't, but tell me anyway.

436
00:27:34.584 --> 00:27:37.781
Bet it's a girl thing, no, right?
I mean, it's got to be.

437
00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:42.688
It's a hot and horny scene.
It's you and another vegetarian.

438
00:27:43.059 --> 00:27:46.927
Come on. Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.
Spare me no detail.

439
00:27:47.463 --> 00:27:51.661
Have you ever met someone and just...

440
00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:57.934
- But there was someone else already?
- Yeah, sure.

441
00:27:58.408 --> 00:27:59.773
Hot ones are always taken.

442
00:28:00.143 --> 00:28:01.804
- So, what do you do?
- What do I do?

443
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:05.841
I shag them.

444
00:28:07.283 --> 00:28:08.910
Partner is their problem, it's not mine.

445
00:28:12.055 --> 00:28:13.935
Yeah, I think you don't mess
with other couples.

446
00:28:14.924 --> 00:28:16.357
Don't cause that pain, ever.

447
00:28:17.493 --> 00:28:19.393
You just face facts that it can't happen...

448
00:28:21.431 --> 00:28:24.559
walk away.
Hook up with someone available instead.

449
00:28:25.034 --> 00:28:28.697
Well, your place or mine? Come on, let's...
I'm so good in bed.

450
00:28:31.374 --> 00:28:34.400
So, you promise me the whole
matchmaking thing is over, right?

451
00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:37.570
Last night was a big success.
They left together.

452
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.945
That distant sound you hear
is wedding bells.

453
00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.347
What, you didn't twig?

454
00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:47.052
- Oh, damn, you are so uncool.
- What? Twig what?

455
00:28:47.156 --> 00:28:51.058
Well, the thing you didn't know about
Luce is the fact that she's... right here.

456
00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.957
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hi!

457
00:28:53.062 --> 00:28:54.154
- Hello.
- Hi.

458
00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:56.008
Weirdest thing,
we were just talking about you.

459
00:28:56.032 --> 00:28:57.624
Oh, all nice, I hope.

460
00:28:58.668 --> 00:29:01.865
- Oh, sorry. Heck, this is Edie.
- Edie.

461
00:29:02.038 --> 00:29:03.767
- Heck.
- And Rachel.

462
00:29:03.973 --> 00:29:05.964
- Rachel.
- Edie.

463
00:29:06.643 --> 00:29:08.975
- Luce?
- Good.

464
00:29:09.345 --> 00:29:11.643
- So, Saturday shopping?
- Is right.

465
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:13.307
Great.

466
00:29:13.616 --> 00:29:17.416
Enjoy it. And listen, thanks for dinner.
We should definitely...

467
00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.680
- Definitely.
- We will.

468
00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:21.916
- Okay. Well, have a nice rest of shop.
- You, too.

469
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:26.772
So, are you going out tonight,
'cause I was thinking...

470
00:29:26.796 --> 00:29:29.856
Whoa, pussycat.
What the hell was going on there?

471
00:29:30.633 --> 00:29:32.999
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Luce is gay.

472
00:29:36.172 --> 00:29:38.436
- She's gay.
- As a tennis player.

473
00:29:39.075 --> 00:29:40.702
Hey, you reckon that's the girlfriend?

474
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.144
She's not just heterosexual.
She's, like, Barbie heterosexual.

475
00:29:45.682 --> 00:29:47.912
Oh, hey. How you doing?

476
00:29:48.017 --> 00:29:49.528
We were just talking about you this time.

477
00:29:49.552 --> 00:29:51.952
- Baby, we'll be late for kickoff.
- Oh, there's hours yet.

478
00:29:52.055 --> 00:29:53.135
Sport thing, football team.

479
00:29:53.222 --> 00:29:56.623
- Oh, how darling. Isn't that darling?
- Good, well, I hope you win.

480
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.225
- Edie, are you gay?
- Oh, God.

481
00:29:59.696 --> 00:30:03.530
Am I gay? I'm ecstatic.

482
00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:05.794
- And are you two...
- No. We're not.

483
00:30:05.902 --> 00:30:09.360
I tried and I tried, but she loves another.

484
00:30:10.239 --> 00:30:11.467
So, I... I'll call you.

485
00:30:11.574 --> 00:30:12.818
- Do, 'cause we should definitely...
- Definitely.

486
00:30:12.842 --> 00:30:13.405
- We will.
- We're going that way.

487
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:13.969
- We will.
- We're going that way.

488
00:30:14.077 --> 00:30:16.602
- Yep. Bye again.
- Bye.

489
00:30:19.716 --> 00:30:23.015
So, I found out they are not an item.

490
00:30:23.119 --> 00:30:24.210
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.

491
00:30:24.234 --> 00:30:25.434
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.

492
00:30:26.456 --> 00:30:27.616
Hi.

493
00:30:29.158 --> 00:30:32.218
- Are you stalking us?
- And why would we do a thing like that?

494
00:30:32.328 --> 00:30:34.193
- We'll be at this till.
- Waving.

495
00:30:34.297 --> 00:30:35.696
- We'll wave back.
- And do.

496
00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:36.856
- Yes.
- Well, we must.

497
00:30:36.966 --> 00:30:38.126
Definitely.

498
00:31:12.668 --> 00:31:14.388
You know if there's a travel section, babe?

499
00:31:18.608 --> 00:31:20.166
I like this jam.

500
00:31:21.411 --> 00:31:22.810
It's really good jam.

501
00:31:24.347 --> 00:31:25.541
I should make jam.

502
00:31:26.249 --> 00:31:29.275
- I could make it, you know.
- 'Course you could.

503
00:31:29.986 --> 00:31:33.615
- You don't think I could.
- Not for a second.

504
00:31:33.723 --> 00:31:35.588
Anyway, I was talking to Rob yesterday.

505
00:31:35.725 --> 00:31:38.523
- That man's an arse.
- That man is an arse.

506
00:31:38.628 --> 00:31:41.119
But he's got this really sweet girlfriend.

507
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.494
God knows what she found
to love about him, but she does.

508
00:31:43.599 --> 00:31:45.123
He cheats on her like a nutter.

509
00:31:46.836 --> 00:31:49.327
- Oh, come back to bed.
- I'm up now.

510
00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.131
Does she know?

511
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.174
Well, I'm like,
"If you wanna leave, tell her."

512
00:31:55.678 --> 00:31:58.511
- You're really up?
- I really am.

513
00:31:59.949 --> 00:32:01.189
Maybe he doesn't want to leave.

514
00:32:02.452 --> 00:32:03.892
Maybe he doesn't know what he wants.

515
00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:06.293
Anyway, he should figure it out
before someone gets hurt.

516
00:32:09.092 --> 00:32:10.286
Why are you looking at me?

517
00:32:11.961 --> 00:32:13.553
'Cause you're a good person.

518
00:32:14.464 --> 00:32:16.955
You wait till I make jam,
then I'll rock your world.

519
00:32:19.869 --> 00:32:22.414
What about a bit more color
in there? I've got some lovely lilac.

520
00:32:22.438 --> 00:32:23.996
Oh, why not?

521
00:32:24.674 --> 00:32:27.074
They're for my boyfriend.

522
00:32:27.844 --> 00:32:31.405
- I'm gonna tell him we're having a baby.
- That's great.

523
00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:34.972
I think so.
He will, too. He definitely will.

524
00:32:35.952 --> 00:32:38.182
He's a bit of a control freak.

525
00:32:38.287 --> 00:32:40.050
I'm surprised he doesn't wear
the diaphragm.

526
00:32:42.658 --> 00:32:43.784
He's...

527
00:32:44.494 --> 00:32:45.494
He's gonna hate me.

528
00:32:49.999 --> 00:32:51.557
He's gonna hate me.

529
00:32:53.202 --> 00:32:56.569
I love him so much.

530
00:32:56.672 --> 00:32:58.606
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
He sounds wonderful.

531
00:32:58.708 --> 00:33:00.039
I didn't...

532
00:33:02.478 --> 00:33:05.447
- I don't know what to do.
- I should...

533
00:33:05.581 --> 00:33:07.606
If you'll just let me...

534
00:33:08.851 --> 00:33:10.148
Flowered Up.

535
00:33:10.853 --> 00:33:12.980
Yes, I can do delivery.

536
00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:15.216
Right now? No, it's no problem.

537
00:33:16.292 --> 00:33:17.292
Hi.

538
00:33:17.393 --> 00:33:18.985
I was told to deliver these to Table 7.

539
00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:20.995
Oh, certainly. It's through there.

540
00:33:34.644 --> 00:33:36.942
- Cute, huh?
- Very cute.

541
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.912
Fuck me if I'm wrong,
but I think you want to kiss me.

542
00:33:40.516 --> 00:33:42.575
Coop, you and me...

543
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.120
it's not gonna happen.

544
00:33:45.922 --> 00:33:46.922
It's not?

545
00:33:48.024 --> 00:33:49.024
I'll be your friend.

546
00:33:50.493 --> 00:33:51.551
Well, that'll do...

547
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.730
for now.

548
00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:05.671
Really.
My daughter's school presentation.

549
00:34:05.775 --> 00:34:07.868
You should've let me get T-shirts made.

550
00:34:07.977 --> 00:34:09.877
It's not really that kind of deal.

551
00:34:09.979 --> 00:34:12.777
Probably a blessing. Your father
doesn't have the body for them.

552
00:34:12.882 --> 00:34:14.816
'Course I'm just speaking from memory.

553
00:34:14.917 --> 00:34:17.351
- Hi.
- Lucy, darling, what are you doing here?

554
00:34:17.453 --> 00:34:18.886
I helped H with her...

555
00:34:18.988 --> 00:34:21.980
- Well, she invited me, so...
- Henrietta's ready to start now.

556
00:34:22.558 --> 00:34:25.959
This is space.
Space is many light years away.

557
00:34:26.529 --> 00:34:30.260
Light years are not measured in days
or months, but in kilometers.

558
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.126
There's a good reason for this,
but I don't quite understand it yet.

559
00:34:35.204 --> 00:34:36.831
This bit is the Milky Way.

560
00:34:37.173 --> 00:34:40.631
It's made up of lots of stars
and lots of celestial phenona...

561
00:34:41.143 --> 00:34:44.271
Phenona... Phenonema.

562
00:34:46.148 --> 00:34:48.639
One of the best constellations
is Ursa Major...

563
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:50.719
which is Latin American for Big Bear.

564
00:34:52.088 --> 00:34:54.556
It's called that
because one day in the olden times...

565
00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:56.215
that never really happened...

566
00:34:56.325 --> 00:34:59.726
a naughty god called Zeus wanted to go to
bed with someone he wasn't married to.

567
00:35:00.896 --> 00:35:03.091
His wife was about to catch him
and be very cross...

568
00:35:03.199 --> 00:35:05.963
so Zeus turned his girlfriend into a bear.

569
00:35:06.068 --> 00:35:08.764
But Mrs. Zeus...

570
00:35:21.284 --> 00:35:23.377
And that's everything
you need to know about space.

571
00:35:31.727 --> 00:35:34.218
- So good.
- Very good.

572
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.830
You have to go, right?

573
00:35:37.466 --> 00:35:39.764
But I don't. I'm okay.

574
00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:42.636
Luce, I...

575
00:35:46.976 --> 00:35:49.774
I think that we should talk
about something that...

576
00:35:51.414 --> 00:35:55.077
- It's just, I don't know. When I'm with...
- Yeah, I do have to go.

577
00:35:55.484 --> 00:35:58.317
Actually, I've just realized
I've got a delivery.

578
00:35:58.421 --> 00:35:59.547
Oh, yeah, right.

579
00:36:00.723 --> 00:36:01.723
You go.

580
00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:04.183
Yeah.

581
00:36:07.463 --> 00:36:08.521
Listen to this.

582
00:36:09.198 --> 00:36:11.276
"In her acceptance speech,
the distinguished scientist...

583
00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.235
"paid tribute to her husband,
Dr. Chris Davis." Spelled wrong.

584
00:36:14.337 --> 00:36:16.828
"Tomorrow the pair celebrate
their 42nd wedding anniversary...

585
00:36:16.939 --> 00:36:19.499
"after eloping together
on the day they met.

586
00:36:19.608 --> 00:36:22.087
"When asked how they could possibly
have known it would all work out...

587
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:24.306
"Professor Harrison... Professor...

588
00:36:24.413 --> 00:36:26.938
"replied in true scientific fashion...

589
00:36:27.049 --> 00:36:31.383
"'You don't know. You can never be sure.
But you take the plunge anyway.

590
00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:33.514
"'Sure is for people
who don't love enough."'

591
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.684
Aw.

592
00:36:36.625 --> 00:36:39.958
- Do you guys believe in love at first sight?
- Well, it saves time.

593
00:36:43.165 --> 00:36:47.158
No. Really, that you could meet
someone, or just...

594
00:36:48.037 --> 00:36:49.095
across a room...

595
00:36:50.539 --> 00:36:53.419
and with that one glance you could
look in their eyes and see their soul.

596
00:36:54.143 --> 00:36:55.463
Do you believe that could happen?

597
00:36:58.581 --> 00:37:00.845
- No.
- Absolutely not.

598
00:37:02.585 --> 00:37:03.711
No. Me, neither.

599
00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:12.093
These are due back Thursday.

600
00:37:12.194 --> 00:37:14.822
If we're closed,
just pop them through the door. Enjoy.

601
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.955
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks.

602
00:37:19.168 --> 00:37:21.193
Hi. These, please.

603
00:37:37.253 --> 00:37:38.253
And this as well.

604
00:37:45.327 --> 00:37:47.454
It's just... It's for research.

605
00:37:48.164 --> 00:37:49.404
Call it what you want, darling.

606
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.600
- It's actually out.
- Oh, that's okay.

607
00:37:53.702 --> 00:37:55.147
- It doesn't matter...
- Although, it's due back.

608
00:37:55.171 --> 00:37:56.882
- I'll give them a call.
- Oh, no, honestly...

609
00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:59.340
Babe, trust me. This one you wanna see.

610
00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:03.640
Hello, Cas?
Yeah, it's Terri from the vid shop.

611
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:07.344
Thought it was you.

612
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.849
- Mum.
- I was just dropping by...

613
00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:10.179
with the wedding snaps.

614
00:38:10.286 --> 00:38:12.584
Though, I tell you,
that photographer should be sacked.

615
00:38:12.688 --> 00:38:16.180
He made me look like a thug.
A thug in lilac.

616
00:38:16.292 --> 00:38:19.659
- Anything good?
- No, no.

617
00:38:19.762 --> 00:38:22.390
There's a lady here needs your copy
of <i>Georgie's Bush.</i>

618
00:38:23.332 --> 00:38:26.301
<i>- Georgie's Bush?</i>
- It's for research.

619
00:38:27.403 --> 00:38:28.700
It's for Heck.

620
00:38:29.205 --> 00:38:31.105
He's very interested in American politics.

621
00:38:31.207 --> 00:38:32.333
She's bringing it round.

622
00:38:32.441 --> 00:38:34.807
Well, I call that very sexy.

623
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:35.910
Hmm?

624
00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:40.206
Wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers, would you?

625
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:41.509
Whoa.

626
00:38:43.319 --> 00:38:46.311
<i>- Oh, Georgie! Oh!
- Call me Mrs. President.</i>

627
00:38:47.523 --> 00:38:48.854
Babe, are you home?

628
00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:51.552
"You have won a share of £1 million."

629
00:38:52.094 --> 00:38:53.220
Excellent.

630
00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.761
- Oh, you are home.
- Hi.

631
00:38:56.866 --> 00:39:00.324
Oh, God. Am I glad to see you.

632
00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:04.161
The morning I've had.
I just had to get away, you know?

633
00:39:06.642 --> 00:39:08.974
- Shall I burn some lunch?
- Please.

634
00:39:09.645 --> 00:39:11.306
Hey, you got some vids.

635
00:39:11.447 --> 00:39:13.792
- Yeah, don't bother looking. I just got...
- This one's great.

636
00:39:13.816 --> 00:39:16.216
This one's pants, but whatever.

637
00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:20.979
And here's one I haven't seen before.

638
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:23.749
Which, are you...

639
00:39:26.762 --> 00:39:29.754
They gave me the wrong one. That...
Oh, my God! That...

640
00:39:29.865 --> 00:39:32.197
The woman at the video store.

641
00:39:32.968 --> 00:39:35.835
- I'll take it back.
- Yeah, take it back. That's excellent, yeah.

642
00:39:35.938 --> 00:39:39.396
I mean, what, it's porn, right?
It's degrading.

643
00:39:39.508 --> 00:39:40.736
- It's offensive.
- God, yes.

644
00:39:40.843 --> 00:39:42.834
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.

645
00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:44.556
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting...

646
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.572
a bit slack in that department recently.

647
00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:51.141
- I know it's my fault and it's... Yeah.
- No, it's mine. I...

648
00:39:52.054 --> 00:39:53.282
But I don't wanna watch this.

649
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.890
- Why?
- It doesn't turn me on.

650
00:40:02.898 --> 00:40:04.229
Makes one of us.

651
00:40:14.443 --> 00:40:16.707
I love the smell of hot dog in the evening.

652
00:40:17.513 --> 00:40:18.537
Smells like...

653
00:40:20.249 --> 00:40:22.717
- hot dog.
- Yeah.

654
00:40:23.218 --> 00:40:25.584
The thing is, Ned,
what I wanted to ask was...

655
00:40:25.688 --> 00:40:29.021
- Two, please.
- I was just wondering if it was a bit...

656
00:40:29.124 --> 00:40:31.991
odd for you guys,
you know, after you got married?

657
00:40:32.094 --> 00:40:35.552
If the interplay between you two...

658
00:40:35.664 --> 00:40:37.655
got a bit...

659
00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:39.256
- clutchy?
- Do you want onions?

660
00:40:39.368 --> 00:40:40.767
No, thanks.

661
00:40:40.869 --> 00:40:43.565
- Because what I'm finding...
- Mustard? Ketchup?

662
00:40:43.672 --> 00:40:47.073
- I can recommend both.
- No, I'm trying to talk to you here.

663
00:40:47.176 --> 00:40:51.135
- Oh? What about, dear boy?
- Well, it's just... I'm just... Well...

664
00:40:51.714 --> 00:40:54.444
I'm finding it a bit tricky at the moment
with Rachel...

665
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:56.882
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.

666
00:40:56.986 --> 00:40:58.746
- Sorry?
- Well, that's our problem, you see.

667
00:40:59.588 --> 00:41:02.523
Two of us,
we can be most pleasant to each other...

668
00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:05.390
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.

669
00:41:05.494 --> 00:41:07.621
- Yeah, yeah.
- Never mention Rachel.

670
00:41:08.631 --> 00:41:10.375
As soon as you do,
the only concrete thought...

671
00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:11.627
running through my mind is...

672
00:41:12.801 --> 00:41:14.666
that hound is putting it up my daughter.

673
00:41:20.342 --> 00:41:21.342
Rach.

674
00:41:32.955 --> 00:41:35.549
Darling, I don't know
what to do about your father.

675
00:41:35.658 --> 00:41:37.578
He's never been
the last of the red hot lovers...

676
00:41:37.626 --> 00:41:41.528
but, recently, it's got to the point
where he's jealous of stiff wind.

677
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:42.654
Hey, you guys.

678
00:41:42.765 --> 00:41:45.256
- Thank God you're here.
- You have no idea.

679
00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:46.425
Good. Got you both.

680
00:41:46.535 --> 00:41:48.696
Now, how are my grandchildren
coming along?

681
00:41:48.804 --> 00:41:50.148
Could you get me away from her, please?

682
00:41:50.172 --> 00:41:51.639
Just hinting, darling.

683
00:41:52.307 --> 00:41:55.743
One wants to have them while
one's still young enough to pick them up.

684
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.121
You know, what I do with your parents
is remind myself...

685
00:42:08.223 --> 00:42:10.817
that if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.

686
00:42:20.169 --> 00:42:21.295
What's up, baby?

687
00:42:23.072 --> 00:42:24.072
Let's go home.

688
00:42:25.274 --> 00:42:28.334
Now, remember,
try not to look like you're my child, okay?

689
00:42:28.444 --> 00:42:30.378
Because it puts men off.

690
00:42:30.479 --> 00:42:33.175
But keep your eyes peeled,
and if you spot anyone, you think...

691
00:42:33.282 --> 00:42:35.216
- you know, "Well, he looks nice..."
- Hi.

692
00:42:35.317 --> 00:42:37.444
- Luce!
- Hey, hey.

693
00:42:37.553 --> 00:42:40.989
- How you doing?
- This is my friend, Beth. She's on her own.

694
00:42:41.557 --> 00:42:43.286
Now you've found a friend, can I go home?

695
00:42:43.392 --> 00:42:44.552
No.

696
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.787
- Trying to find her a man.
- There aren't any.

697
00:42:46.895 --> 00:42:49.261
Trust me, I've looked. Oh, careful.

698
00:42:49.364 --> 00:42:52.231
- Sorry, Mrs...
- Don't call me "Mrs."

699
00:42:55.237 --> 00:42:56.795
Hello.

700
00:42:56.905 --> 00:42:58.099
All right?

701
00:43:05.247 --> 00:43:06.247
Brilliant.

702
00:43:08.584 --> 00:43:12.543
<i>You've got a boyfriend
You've got a boyfriend.</i>

703
00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:14.747
No, I haven't. Not yet.

704
00:43:16.725 --> 00:43:19.023
I can't wait till you get a boyfriend.

705
00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:22.495
- You probably can, actually.
- You could even get a husband.

706
00:43:22.598 --> 00:43:24.498
You're old enough. Find one like Heck.

707
00:43:26.135 --> 00:43:28.501
H, I should explain something to you.

708
00:43:28.604 --> 00:43:32.165
I do believe I will be with one person
for the rest of my life...

709
00:43:32.274 --> 00:43:34.708
but that person will be a woman.

710
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:36.569
I understand.

711
00:43:37.513 --> 00:43:38.513
You do?

712
00:43:38.847 --> 00:43:40.872
My best friend is Natalie Curtis.

713
00:43:40.983 --> 00:43:43.747
I'd rather spend the rest of my life
with her than any boy.

714
00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:45.419
There you go.

715
00:43:47.389 --> 00:43:49.482
It doesn't mean
that you're a lesbian or anything.

716
00:43:50.526 --> 00:43:51.891
Come on, let's go.

717
00:43:57.499 --> 00:44:00.229
- I'll put the kettle on, babe.
- I'll have a beer instead.

718
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:02.093
Really?

719
00:44:04.173 --> 00:44:06.971
- I was gonna offer, but...
- But what?

720
00:44:08.544 --> 00:44:09.568
Rach, are you pregnant?

721
00:44:14.049 --> 00:44:15.516
No. No, I'm not, no.

722
00:44:16.652 --> 00:44:18.452
I just thought
it might explain your recent...

723
00:44:21.089 --> 00:44:22.920
Whatever. Nothing.

724
00:44:28.697 --> 00:44:29.959
Unless...

725
00:44:31.567 --> 00:44:32.567
Unless what?

726
00:44:36.038 --> 00:44:37.198
Mmm.

727
00:44:38.207 --> 00:44:39.327
Do you want to get pregnant?

728
00:44:41.076 --> 00:44:42.407
You and my mum.

729
00:44:43.412 --> 00:44:46.245
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait...

730
00:44:46.348 --> 00:44:49.010
but until what,
you know, we're even more settled?

731
00:44:49.952 --> 00:44:51.032
Come on, what do you think?

732
00:44:59.494 --> 00:45:00.494
I got to take it.

733
00:45:02.097 --> 00:45:03.257
Rob, hey, what's up?

734
00:45:05.267 --> 00:45:06.495
No, I've a minute.

735
00:45:07.269 --> 00:45:09.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They're in my briefcase, hang on.

736
00:45:27.389 --> 00:45:28.651
Hello.

737
00:45:31.093 --> 00:45:32.185
<i>Hello.</i>

738
00:45:38.867 --> 00:45:40.300
Hey, gorgeous.

739
00:45:40.402 --> 00:45:44.361
That was Rob.
Look, I'm really sorry about this but...

740
00:45:47.509 --> 00:45:49.340
No, of course you should still go.

741
00:45:49.444 --> 00:45:53.175
You know, I wouldn't put you through
my evening for all the coke in Colombia.

742
00:45:53.282 --> 00:45:56.115
You know, it'll be the usual bollocks,
everyone will get pissed.

743
00:45:56.218 --> 00:45:57.242
I'll get pissed...

744
00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.932
And start singing country and western
songs badly like I always do.

745
00:46:00.956 --> 00:46:02.048
Hello?

746
00:46:02.591 --> 00:46:06.459
- Heck, it's Luce.
<i>- Hey, Luce. How's it going?</i>

747
00:46:07.362 --> 00:46:08.761
It's Luce. What's up?

748
00:46:09.197 --> 00:46:11.461
Nothing. My phone just rang and...

749
00:46:11.566 --> 00:46:14.535
Sorry, you busy Tuesday night?

750
00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.547
Do you fancy
escorting my wife somewhere?

751
00:46:16.571 --> 00:46:20.063
It's just, like, I've got this
wanky work thing which I can't get out of.

752
00:46:20.175 --> 00:46:22.553
You know, it'll be really great
if you could look after Rach for me.

753
00:46:22.577 --> 00:46:23.771
Go on, say yes. Go on.

754
00:46:23.879 --> 00:46:26.370
- Then, yes.
<i>- Brilliant. Brilliant.</i>

755
00:46:26.982 --> 00:46:29.917
Well, Rach will ring you
with the details...

756
00:46:30.018 --> 00:46:32.009
and be safe.

757
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:33.521
You, too.

758
00:46:36.758 --> 00:46:39.226
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.

759
00:46:39.328 --> 00:46:40.920
Yeah, but she's your...

760
00:46:41.163 --> 00:46:44.621
soul-mate-for-life type thing.
You'll have a belter.

761
00:46:44.733 --> 00:46:45.733
Beer.

762
00:46:48.904 --> 00:46:50.269
Does she know where we're going?

763
00:46:51.606 --> 00:46:55.064
Go on, hound him!
Hound his legs, chop him!

764
00:46:55.877 --> 00:46:58.744
- Over there!
- On the left side!

765
00:47:00.816 --> 00:47:03.307
- You know, you're kind of shrill.
- What?

766
00:47:03.418 --> 00:47:05.147
When you shout.

767
00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:07.853
You want them to hear your abuse better,
you've got to project it.

768
00:47:10.492 --> 00:47:12.323
- Teach me.
- Okay.

769
00:47:12.427 --> 00:47:14.895
First off, tighten your stomach muscles.

770
00:47:14.997 --> 00:47:17.625
- I don't think I've got any.
- Yeah, you do.

771
00:47:17.733 --> 00:47:19.963
- You really do. They're right here.
- There?

772
00:47:20.068 --> 00:47:21.068
Mmm-hmm.

773
00:47:21.169 --> 00:47:22.830
- Tighten.
- Tighten.

774
00:47:23.271 --> 00:47:24.795
- Tense them.
- They're pretty tense.

775
00:47:24.906 --> 00:47:27.431
Okay, next, broaden your diaphragm.

776
00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.701
- My what?
- It's here.

777
00:47:31.947 --> 00:47:32.947
Oh.

778
00:47:33.348 --> 00:47:35.612
Okay, push it out against my hand.

779
00:47:37.552 --> 00:47:39.179
You feel my hand?

780
00:47:40.922 --> 00:47:42.981
Maybe if you put them both there.

781
00:47:49.164 --> 00:47:50.563
Okay.

782
00:47:52.034 --> 00:47:53.831
And now, for the big one.

783
00:47:54.336 --> 00:47:57.203
Imagine the roof of your mouth
is a cathedral.

784
00:47:59.107 --> 00:48:01.541
- No, you've lost me.
- Oh, come on.

785
00:48:01.643 --> 00:48:03.634
No, the muscles,
the diaphragm, I'm there, but...

786
00:48:03.745 --> 00:48:04.905
It's a space thing.

787
00:48:05.013 --> 00:48:08.847
All right, your mouth is that big
that you have to fill it with sound.

788
00:48:09.051 --> 00:48:10.792
Deep from inside, filling the space,
then throwing it out.

789
00:48:10.816 --> 00:48:13.097
Deep from inside, filling the space,
then throwing it out.

790
00:48:13.822 --> 00:48:15.050
Like how?

791
00:48:16.825 --> 00:48:18.019
Like this.

792
00:48:18.794 --> 00:48:23.697
You're a wanker, Number 9!

793
00:48:25.534 --> 00:48:27.331
- That's not bad, is it?
- No.

794
00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:33.205
All right, so your turn.
Where do you want to go?

795
00:48:33.308 --> 00:48:35.242
I don't care where we go.

796
00:48:35.343 --> 00:48:37.368
Good. I'll decide again.

797
00:48:37.546 --> 00:48:38.808
Okay.

798
00:48:38.947 --> 00:48:40.414
I feel like dancing.

799
00:48:41.149 --> 00:48:43.709
Boom. Hold that thought.

800
00:48:43.952 --> 00:48:46.420
What? What, you know somewhere
we should go?

801
00:48:46.521 --> 00:48:47.545
Got an idea.

802
00:48:48.023 --> 00:48:50.287
<i>Let's begin the dancing.</i>

803
00:48:57.065 --> 00:48:59.260
<i>Disco, disco, disco.</i>

804
00:49:02.471 --> 00:49:04.666
<i>Okay, do the dog kick.</i>

805
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.538
<i>Now we are talking boogie.</i>

806
00:49:18.987 --> 00:49:22.445
<i>Yeah, that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh.</i>

807
00:49:27.229 --> 00:49:30.892
<i>I know what I like,
and I am liking what I see.</i>

808
00:49:36.738 --> 00:49:38.035
<i>You guys rule!</i>

809
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:42.606
- All right, more.
- Tell me about the lily.

810
00:49:42.777 --> 00:49:46.235
- You don't want to know about the lily.
- It's my favorite.

811
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.150
Ask me about the azalea.

812
00:49:52.754 --> 00:49:55.746
All right. What about the azalea?

813
00:49:55.991 --> 00:49:59.154
The azalea means,
"May you achieve financial security."

814
00:49:59.661 --> 00:50:01.128
- Bah.
- See?

815
00:50:02.898 --> 00:50:05.867
Lovely. Now, tell me about the lily.

816
00:50:08.136 --> 00:50:10.195
The lily means...

817
00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.840
The lily means, "I dare you to love me."

818
00:50:21.917 --> 00:50:23.145
Well, thanks for this evening.

819
00:50:24.619 --> 00:50:26.814
- Thank you.
- It was my birthday.

820
00:50:27.756 --> 00:50:31.214
No, today? You should've said.

821
00:50:31.326 --> 00:50:34.625
- It's mine coming up.
- We're practically twins.

822
00:50:37.032 --> 00:50:38.590
This is me.

823
00:50:44.105 --> 00:50:45.265
I...

824
00:50:46.274 --> 00:50:47.832
Okay, good night.

825
00:50:48.743 --> 00:50:49.835
Yeah.

826
00:50:50.612 --> 00:50:51.943
Night.

827
00:51:13.168 --> 00:51:14.567
Your feet.

828
00:51:15.937 --> 00:51:18.997
- Are they cold?
- No, stinking.

829
00:51:21.009 --> 00:51:23.034
Yes, of course, they're cold.

830
00:51:23.812 --> 00:51:25.245
Come here.

831
00:51:37.225 --> 00:51:40.353
You fancy coming round mine
tonight, or are you too married?

832
00:51:40.462 --> 00:51:42.102
Actually, Rach wants to
take me to dinner.

833
00:51:42.731 --> 00:51:45.199
Just phoned me up
and wants to take me to dinner...

834
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.632
- which is sweet.
- Very sweet.

835
00:51:47.736 --> 00:51:48.964
Yeah.

836
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.265
Blow her off. Come round mine for pizza.

837
00:51:51.373 --> 00:51:54.274
Really, no, I want you to meet
the Italian girl that delivers it.

838
00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:57.470
What about that flower girl, Luce?
I thought you had plans there.

839
00:51:57.579 --> 00:51:59.547
There's another one
that won't let me get it wet.

840
00:51:59.648 --> 00:52:00.648
She's gay.

841
00:52:00.715 --> 00:52:03.195
- I'm a cure for lesbianism.
- No, you're a deeply shallow man.

842
00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:04.513
Yes, I am.

843
00:52:04.619 --> 00:52:05.779
When's it gonna stop?

844
00:52:06.388 --> 00:52:08.913
- Never, I hope.
- God bless you.

845
00:52:11.693 --> 00:52:14.389
Really, though, you know, I'm 29 years old.

846
00:52:14.496 --> 00:52:17.056
- You're 31.
- Precisely my point. I'm getting older.

847
00:52:19.234 --> 00:52:20.963
And I see you...

848
00:52:21.403 --> 00:52:22.893
I see what you've got with...

849
00:52:24.506 --> 00:52:25.996
I can see that stability.

850
00:52:27.442 --> 00:52:30.206
And the trust, and permanence.

851
00:52:31.746 --> 00:52:32.804
And I think...

852
00:52:33.748 --> 00:52:35.511
"God, I'm glad I'm not you."

853
00:52:37.585 --> 00:52:40.679
Actually things don't feel
totally 100% stable at the moment.

854
00:52:40.922 --> 00:52:42.184
You got trouble in paradise?

855
00:52:43.925 --> 00:52:44.983
No, no, no.

856
00:52:46.461 --> 00:52:48.221
How could there be?
We only just got married.

857
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:49.840
That's all it... All it is, isn't it?

858
00:52:49.864 --> 00:52:51.422
Millie! Millie, darling.

859
00:52:51.533 --> 00:52:53.626
I'm sorry I'm late.

860
00:52:53.735 --> 00:52:55.327
- Coop.
- Don't move.

861
00:52:56.071 --> 00:52:58.005
- What?
- No, there's just...

862
00:52:58.106 --> 00:53:01.872
a girl back there that I never called back.
Just stay perfectly still, okay?

863
00:53:02.377 --> 00:53:03.867
We'll get through this.

864
00:53:12.087 --> 00:53:14.851
Did you ever, you know...

865
00:53:14.956 --> 00:53:16.184
cross the street?

866
00:53:16.291 --> 00:53:17.349
That depends.

867
00:53:17.859 --> 00:53:20.953
- On what?
- On what the hell you're talking about.

868
00:53:21.896 --> 00:53:24.057
- Drink after work tonight?
- Dinner with Heck.

869
00:53:25.967 --> 00:53:28.299
I mean, did you ever...

870
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:31.962
fancy, or think you might've briefly
before you realized you didn't...

871
00:53:32.073 --> 00:53:35.531
- another woman?
- Why?

872
00:53:37.178 --> 00:53:40.058
I'm trying to find someone for Beth,
and I thought I'd double my chances.

873
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:44.414
Already tried it. It didn't happen for me.

874
00:53:44.953 --> 00:53:45.953
I like men.

875
00:53:46.287 --> 00:53:48.619
I mean, I hate men, but, you know.

876
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:51.115
I always hoped to do a woman
before I died.

877
00:53:51.626 --> 00:53:52.820
But it's kind of like...

878
00:53:52.927 --> 00:53:55.167
I want to go to Norway sometime.
Do you know what I mean?

879
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.161
Probably never gonna happen.

880
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:02.534
- So Heck's taking you to dinner?
- I'm taking him.

881
00:54:04.606 --> 00:54:05.937
How perfect.

882
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:16.750
That was fun.

883
00:54:18.386 --> 00:54:19.386
Wasn't it fun?

884
00:54:20.455 --> 00:54:21.752
Had a good time.

885
00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:26.623
- You know, Rach, I think...
- Hey, the heath!

886
00:54:27.195 --> 00:54:29.155
You remember that night
you took me in the bushes?

887
00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:31.999
- I never took you in the bushes.
- Sorry, wrong guy.

888
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.068
I took you up against a tree.

889
00:54:34.169 --> 00:54:37.104
I can't be dealing with bushes, nettles,
and deadly nightshade.

890
00:54:37.205 --> 00:54:39.332
- Let's do it.
- What?

891
00:54:39.441 --> 00:54:41.705
- Let's go. Let's do it now.
- No.

892
00:54:43.011 --> 00:54:44.376
Rach, no.

893
00:54:46.948 --> 00:54:47.972
Rach.

894
00:54:49.217 --> 00:54:50.844
Rach, where are you?

895
00:54:51.786 --> 00:54:52.786
Come on, darling.

896
00:54:54.022 --> 00:54:55.022
Rachel!

897
00:54:55.924 --> 00:54:58.791
I just, I just don't understand
why we have to do this stuff anymore.

898
00:54:58.893 --> 00:55:01.987
You know, we've got a flat.
It's a good one.

899
00:55:02.464 --> 00:55:05.797
And I've confiscated your mother's key,
so she can't sneak up on us anymore.

900
00:55:06.434 --> 00:55:08.459
And I swear that woman's got a sex radar.

901
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.697
We've got a bed, you know.
Warm, it's welcoming...

902
00:55:10.805 --> 00:55:13.325
it smells nice, it's a damn sight better
than this arsing place.

903
00:55:14.142 --> 00:55:15.268
Jesus Christ.

904
00:55:16.211 --> 00:55:19.237
- Did I scare you?
- No. Nettles everywhere.

905
00:55:19.347 --> 00:55:21.372
- What are you doing?
- Taking off your clothes.

906
00:55:21.483 --> 00:55:23.494
Actually, it's one of the great things
about being a man.

907
00:55:23.518 --> 00:55:25.062
You can do these things
without stripping off.

908
00:55:25.086 --> 00:55:28.078
Just a zip. Simple zip is all you need.

909
00:55:28.189 --> 00:55:30.453
Give it a yank,
and you're well away, darling.

910
00:55:30.558 --> 00:55:34.016
- You gonna talk all through this?
- Did I mention we have a bed?

911
00:55:37.332 --> 00:55:39.095
- What was that?
- What?

912
00:55:41.102 --> 00:55:42.797
Nothing. Nothing.

913
00:55:48.776 --> 00:55:50.087
All right, whoever is behind there...

914
00:55:50.111 --> 00:55:52.045
come out before we beat
the crap out of you.

915
00:55:52.146 --> 00:55:53.841
Yeah, damn it.

916
00:55:56.384 --> 00:55:57.612
Terribly sorry.

917
00:55:57.719 --> 00:55:58.879
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

918
00:55:58.987 --> 00:56:00.386
Oh, God.

919
00:56:00.688 --> 00:56:03.657
- We were trying not to disturb you.
- That's fine, really.

920
00:56:03.758 --> 00:56:06.022
Disturb us? No. No, you didn't disturb us.

921
00:56:06.127 --> 00:56:08.994
- We, we... We were just, you know.
- So were we.

922
00:56:10.198 --> 00:56:13.031
So, you think we were...
No, and we're married.

923
00:56:13.635 --> 00:56:14.932
And we have a bed.

924
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.463
- I'm Heck, by the way.
- Michael.

925
00:56:17.572 --> 00:56:18.816
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

926
00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.569
- Michael, too.
- Oh, really.

927
00:56:20.675 --> 00:56:22.074
I'm Rachel.

928
00:56:22.176 --> 00:56:23.837
It was lovely to meet you two chaps.

929
00:56:27.582 --> 00:56:30.881
- Must be very nice to be married.
- We only just met this evening.

930
00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.320
Yeah, sometimes I feel like we did, too.

931
00:56:59.647 --> 00:57:02.275
- Hi.
- No, no, you're not happy to see...

932
00:57:02.383 --> 00:57:04.351
You can't.
I don't want you to be happy to see me.

933
00:57:04.452 --> 00:57:05.783
- Okay.
- Okay.

934
00:57:05.887 --> 00:57:08.583
So, I'm here because
I don't know what's going on.

935
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:09.748
I don't.

936
00:57:09.857 --> 00:57:13.384
You make me feel something.
Something I absolutely cannot feel.

937
00:57:13.494 --> 00:57:14.859
I'm married.

938
00:57:14.963 --> 00:57:18.091
I'm married, for Christ's sake.
I have a husband, this...

939
00:57:18.232 --> 00:57:22.225
man that I... This lovely guy.
He's done nothing wrong.

940
00:57:22.337 --> 00:57:24.066
I was wondering if you could help me?

941
00:57:24.172 --> 00:57:26.197
I'm hoping to start a herb garden.

942
00:57:26.307 --> 00:57:28.241
It's a pretty little corner space...

943
00:57:28.343 --> 00:57:31.073
- north, right?
- These, these. On the house. Go.

944
00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:38.444
Okay, so do you see? You have to see.

945
00:57:38.553 --> 00:57:41.113
I can't do this. I can't actually do this.

946
00:57:41.222 --> 00:57:44.123
So whatever it is or was,
it's got to stop, and it's got to stop now.

947
00:57:44.225 --> 00:57:45.225
Do you understand?

948
00:57:45.927 --> 00:57:46.985
It's over.

949
00:58:26.934 --> 00:58:27.958
Ow!

950
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:30.537
- What, what?
- Thorns in my bum.

951
00:58:36.644 --> 00:58:37.668
I'm sorry.

952
00:58:42.984 --> 00:58:44.110
It's another customer.

953
00:58:47.088 --> 00:58:48.282
Hello?

954
00:58:52.627 --> 00:58:53.821
Luce?

955
00:58:56.431 --> 00:58:57.921
Luce, you in the back?

956
00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.360
Don't come in, Heck, I...

957
00:59:05.273 --> 00:59:08.003
I was stock taking.

958
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:09.201
You know, counting the...

959
00:59:10.745 --> 00:59:12.804
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

960
00:59:14.782 --> 00:59:15.976
What do you want, Heck?

961
00:59:16.918 --> 00:59:19.182
Buy some flowers. What else?

962
00:59:20.588 --> 00:59:24.354
- Flowers, of course.
- Not for me, for my wife, Rachel.

963
00:59:25.259 --> 00:59:26.817
Recently, she's just been a bit...

964
00:59:27.695 --> 00:59:28.695
I don't know.

965
00:59:28.896 --> 00:59:29.940
But you know what they say...

966
00:59:29.964 --> 00:59:32.142
there's nothing quite so cheering
as a well-timed bloom.

967
00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:34.259
So, I thought
one of your finest arrangements.

968
00:59:34.368 --> 00:59:35.368
Absolutely.

969
00:59:35.937 --> 00:59:38.462
- What does she like?
- You know what she likes.

970
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:43.209
Lilies. She likes lilies.

971
00:59:45.012 --> 00:59:48.413
- Lilies? Right, well, that's simple.
- Yeah.

972
00:59:49.784 --> 00:59:51.328
So, did you enjoy the football
the other night?

973
00:59:51.352 --> 00:59:53.183
It was an experience.

974
00:59:54.989 --> 00:59:57.355
How did you find Rachel?

975
00:59:59.193 --> 01:00:01.320
Fine. I mean, I wouldn't...

976
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.492
Fine.

977
01:00:04.332 --> 01:00:05.890
I don't suppose she...

978
01:00:06.701 --> 01:00:08.532
No. Well...

979
01:00:08.636 --> 01:00:12.197
I was just wondering
if she said anything about...

980
01:00:12.306 --> 01:00:13.188
me or...

981
01:00:13.223 --> 01:00:14.223
me or...

982
01:00:19.714 --> 01:00:22.581
I just think I'm doing something wrong,
is all.

983
01:00:22.683 --> 01:00:23.803
I mean, that's what I think.

984
01:00:24.452 --> 01:00:26.511
And if she said what it is...

985
01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:30.889
that I'm doing, or not doing,
then I can stop it.

986
01:00:31.859 --> 01:00:34.259
Or start, or whatever, you see.

987
01:00:34.595 --> 01:00:35.687
And then we can...

988
01:00:37.298 --> 01:00:38.298
Like before.

989
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.192
We can get back to being like before.

990
01:00:43.738 --> 01:00:45.933
- She didn't say anything.
- No.

991
01:00:48.075 --> 01:00:49.075
And I've embarrassed you.

992
01:00:49.977 --> 01:00:53.674
And myself, which is normal, very normal.

993
01:00:53.948 --> 01:00:56.644
- These are beautiful. How much do I...
- No, they're on the house.

994
01:00:58.486 --> 01:00:59.646
Thanks.

995
01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:04.682
You should ask her, you know. Not me.

996
01:01:06.427 --> 01:01:08.019
Bless you, but...

997
01:01:08.629 --> 01:01:10.620
I can't ask Rachel
if there's anything wrong.

998
01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:12.926
I mean, that's way too scary.

999
01:01:13.768 --> 01:01:14.826
Why?

1000
01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:18.471
What if there is?

1001
01:01:21.909 --> 01:01:23.069
Thanks.

1002
01:01:41.295 --> 01:01:42.455
Rachel!

1003
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.630
- Rachel, wait!
- Luce, please!

1004
01:01:44.732 --> 01:01:47.064
- Just talk to me.
- What do you want me to say?

1005
01:01:47.168 --> 01:01:50.365
I heard him.
Jesus, I'm lying there, and I heard him...

1006
01:01:50.471 --> 01:01:51.904
and he's blaming himself.

1007
01:01:52.506 --> 01:01:53.598
You can put an end to this.

1008
01:01:53.708 --> 01:01:55.039
- How?
- Tell me to go.

1009
01:01:59.046 --> 01:02:01.378
Tell me that's what you want,
and I will walk away...

1010
01:02:01.482 --> 01:02:02.762
and you will never see me again.

1011
01:02:05.953 --> 01:02:06.953
Is that what you want?

1012
01:02:09.991 --> 01:02:10.991
I want you.

1013
01:02:17.598 --> 01:02:18.690
Luce.

1014
01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:20.695
I know.

1015
01:02:22.536 --> 01:02:23.536
I can't...

1016
01:02:24.972 --> 01:02:26.132
I know.

1017
01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:34.971
We'll be okay.

1018
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:41.579
Don't forget me.

1019
01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:46.085
I won't remember anything else.

1020
01:03:28.169 --> 01:03:31.263
Come on, Jeff, you scratch my back
and I'll kiss your arse.

1021
01:03:32.473 --> 01:03:33.833
Okay, can you repeat that, please?

1022
01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:36.574
Okay, 41 flat.

1023
01:03:36.677 --> 01:03:39.656
Okay, well, let me just factor that into
the computer and crunch some numbers.

1024
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.205
He can't go any higher.
I mean, he hasn't got it. He can't.

1025
01:03:43.517 --> 01:03:45.508
Yeah, the screen's flashing red
at me here, Jeff.

1026
01:03:45.619 --> 01:03:48.179
It's not gonna cut it.
In fact, the figure that I'm reading is...

1027
01:03:49.256 --> 01:03:51.468
Yeah, but the figure I'm reading
is forty-one and a half.

1028
01:03:51.492 --> 01:03:54.222
That's 41.5. Any lower just can't be a go.

1029
01:03:54.328 --> 01:03:56.353
That's way too much. It's too much.

1030
01:03:58.766 --> 01:04:01.860
So let's do it, Jeff. Let's work our
way up. Give me 41.1. Give me that.

1031
01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:03.834
We're feeling no pain there,
and you know what?

1032
01:04:03.938 --> 01:04:07.066
If we're at 0.1, let's have some fun.
Let's double down.

1033
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:09.542
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

1034
01:04:13.814 --> 01:04:14.854
All right, keep on coming.

1035
01:04:14.949 --> 01:04:18.077
Keep on coming. Give me three, three is
well in. You give me that right now...

1036
01:04:18.185 --> 01:04:20.881
You will?
Well, then go one more. Go to four.

1037
01:04:20.988 --> 01:04:23.582
I really, really, really don't wanna do it.

1038
01:04:27.294 --> 01:04:29.439
Yeah, yeah. Jeff, you know,
don't take that tone with me.

1039
01:04:29.463 --> 01:04:32.309
You know, I'm giving you a chance here.
Now, do you wanna be a big dog...

1040
01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.011
or do you wanna play on the porch
with the puppies?

1041
01:04:34.035 --> 01:04:36.936
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I feel that.
Okay, last one, my friend.

1042
01:04:37.038 --> 01:04:39.836
Over the cliff. I'm holding your hand,
I'm cupping your balls.

1043
01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:43.103
I'm there with you, and I'm there for you.
You've gotta ask yourself, Jeffrey...

1044
01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.838
do you trust me? Do you trust me?

1045
01:04:48.649 --> 01:04:50.207
Congratulations. We can deal.

1046
01:04:53.621 --> 01:04:56.488
My boy, for that,
you get a bonus as big as my knob.

1047
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:57.590
Well, screw your bonus.

1048
01:04:57.691 --> 01:04:59.703
I wish I could.
Now, where'd you wanna go for a drink?

1049
01:04:59.727 --> 01:05:00.955
Screw you, too, Rob.

1050
01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:04.227
Hecky, what is it?

1051
01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:07.832
It just... It makes me sick, you know.
You lie. You just lie.

1052
01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:12.496
Well, so do you.

1053
01:05:13.874 --> 01:05:14.874
Not anymore.

1054
01:05:19.747 --> 01:05:22.773
Heck. Hecky. Hecky, come back!

1055
01:05:28.856 --> 01:05:30.551
- Hi.
- Afternoon.

1056
01:05:32.293 --> 01:05:34.090
I'm looking for a breakup plant.

1057
01:05:34.195 --> 01:05:36.527
- A what?
- A breakup plant.

1058
01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:37.857
Explain.

1059
01:05:37.998 --> 01:05:40.831
Well, I don't like my girlfriend.
I wanna break up with her...

1060
01:05:40.935 --> 01:05:42.800
via the means of plant.

1061
01:05:42.903 --> 01:05:46.134
Well, it should be a breakup bouquet,
and it should be hydrangeas.

1062
01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.708
They mean,
"It's over, but think well of me."

1063
01:05:48.809 --> 01:05:50.504
Perfect. I'll take one.

1064
01:05:50.611 --> 01:05:53.171
- One bouquet?
- One hyer-whatsit.

1065
01:05:53.414 --> 01:05:55.143
But that's not a lot.

1066
01:05:55.249 --> 01:05:57.012
Well, I don't care if
she thinks well of me.

1067
01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.086
D'you know what? Piss off!

1068
01:06:00.187 --> 01:06:02.212
- Pardon?
- Out! Get out of my shop.

1069
01:06:02.323 --> 01:06:04.985
She's well rid of your fat arse, anyway.

1070
01:06:23.844 --> 01:06:25.675
Mum?

1071
01:06:25.779 --> 01:06:27.110
I'll be right out.

1072
01:06:28.415 --> 01:06:29.973
Take your time.

1073
01:06:43.864 --> 01:06:47.027
Oh, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?

1074
01:06:48.302 --> 01:06:50.634
Blow your nose, then explain.

1075
01:06:55.142 --> 01:06:56.142
I met this girl.

1076
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.508
She's with someone else.

1077
01:07:01.782 --> 01:07:02.874
And does she love you?

1078
01:07:04.985 --> 01:07:05.985
I don't know.

1079
01:07:07.221 --> 01:07:08.221
No.

1080
01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:13.251
Yes.

1081
01:07:16.263 --> 01:07:17.423
But it doesn't matter.

1082
01:07:18.499 --> 01:07:20.831
Oh, it's all that matters.

1083
01:07:22.102 --> 01:07:23.899
She's with someone else. She can't...

1084
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:31.173
When Dad left you, he broke your heart.

1085
01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:34.774
It mends again.

1086
01:07:40.187 --> 01:07:41.814
Look at you, you look fantastic.

1087
01:07:43.457 --> 01:07:46.085
I may be older than God,
but I can still make an effort.

1088
01:07:46.527 --> 01:07:49.462
A date? Does my mother have a date?

1089
01:07:50.297 --> 01:07:52.231
I'm going to eat food with a man, yes.

1090
01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:54.534
And how do you feel?

1091
01:07:55.302 --> 01:07:56.428
Oh.

1092
01:07:57.705 --> 01:08:01.163
Well, you know,
when you're holding a hot cup of coffee...

1093
01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:02.867
and you realize you're going to sneeze?

1094
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:05.337
That's how I feel.

1095
01:08:06.981 --> 01:08:08.278
Come here.

1096
01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:10.283
Well, yippee.

1097
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:25.797
Oh, shit. Heck, where have you...

1098
01:08:32.206 --> 01:08:33.673
Never fails.

1099
01:08:33.774 --> 01:08:37.676
Eight pints of water before bed,
and next day, you feel no pain.

1100
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.375
Are you well, my gorgeous darling?

1101
01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:45.446
- I want to talk to you.
- I want to talk to you, too.

1102
01:08:45.552 --> 01:08:49.545
Just three more of these
and I'm quite literally all ears.

1103
01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:51.291
I'll be waiting.

1104
01:08:51.525 --> 01:08:52.719
Mmm-hmm.

1105
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:58.191
Very listening.

1106
01:09:02.069 --> 01:09:03.195
Shoot.

1107
01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:06.231
I wanted to talk to you because...

1108
01:09:07.074 --> 01:09:09.042
I have to talk to you
because this thing happened.

1109
01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:16.346
I wasn't looking for it, it just...

1110
01:09:17.084 --> 01:09:19.484
It just happened, and although...

1111
01:09:21.288 --> 01:09:22.721
it's over...

1112
01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:28.954
you've a right to know.

1113
01:09:42.876 --> 01:09:44.639
I went crazy, Heck.

1114
01:09:50.551 --> 01:09:52.985
I went crazy for someone,
and it wasn't you.

1115
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.657
I'm sorry.

1116
01:10:05.966 --> 01:10:08.093
I'm so very sorry, so...

1117
01:10:12.506 --> 01:10:13.632
please believe me.

1118
01:10:15.008 --> 01:10:16.066
Heck?

1119
01:10:18.746 --> 01:10:21.874
No, no, no. Don't sleep. Wake up, Heck.

1120
01:10:22.816 --> 01:10:25.080
I can't say this more than once.

1121
01:10:28.288 --> 01:10:29.653
I'm staying.

1122
01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:36.262
I couldn't, wouldn't leave you.

1123
01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:40.897
You are my best friend.

1124
01:10:43.504 --> 01:10:47.565
And that was enough before.
It'll be enough again, so...

1125
01:11:28.015 --> 01:11:29.107
Coop.

1126
01:11:30.517 --> 01:11:32.985
It is you, then, is it?

1127
01:11:34.188 --> 01:11:36.986
- Is what? I don't...
- Heck doesn't know.

1128
01:11:37.724 --> 01:11:40.158
He said that she didn't tell who...

1129
01:11:40.461 --> 01:11:42.429
but I figured it out.

1130
01:11:44.898 --> 01:11:45.898
What did he say?

1131
01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:48.596
Just tell me I'm wrong, girl.

1132
01:11:50.037 --> 01:11:51.037
Tell me.

1133
01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:55.482
- You dumb slut.
- Don't start, Coop.

1134
01:11:55.506 --> 01:11:56.946
- You dumb slut.
- Don't start, Coop.

1135
01:11:57.678 --> 01:11:58.804
"Don't start"?

1136
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:03.778
Her husband, her flipping husband
calls me in the middle of the night.

1137
01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.216
And you wanna know how he was?
He was busted!

1138
01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.320
You know, just get out.

1139
01:12:07.421 --> 01:12:09.719
What was that thing that you said?
What was that?

1140
01:12:09.823 --> 01:12:11.347
"Never wreck another couple."

1141
01:12:12.526 --> 01:12:14.326
You really stuck to that one good,
didn't you?

1142
01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:28.939
Okay, then. Okay. Yeah.

1143
01:12:29.543 --> 01:12:31.010
See you. Bye.

1144
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.784
It's wonderful. Thank you.

1145
01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:44.483
There's a lovely section
on cooking with your children.

1146
01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:47.589
- Who was on the phone, honey?
- Luce.

1147
01:12:48.262 --> 01:12:50.890
She was supposed to take
me and my boyfriend to the museum...

1148
01:12:50.998 --> 01:12:51.998
but now we're not.

1149
01:12:52.199 --> 01:12:53.223
Oh.

1150
01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:54.459
Maybe some other time.

1151
01:12:54.568 --> 01:12:57.366
Not for a while.
She's going on a very long holiday.

1152
01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:00.439
She is?

1153
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.341
When was the last time
you took me on holiday?

1154
01:13:02.976 --> 01:13:05.809
The summer of '94. Great Barrier Reef.

1155
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.107
You scared all the sharks away.

1156
01:13:09.783 --> 01:13:11.383
She didn't mention that the other night.

1157
01:13:12.486 --> 01:13:14.297
No, yes, she did say something,
I remember now.

1158
01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:17.552
Will you take us to the museum?
And can Heck come, too?

1159
01:13:17.658 --> 01:13:19.216
Of course he can.

1160
01:13:19.326 --> 01:13:20.657
Do penguins have knees?

1161
01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:24.719
Well, this is fun, isn't it?
Shame it's only once a year.

1162
01:13:37.044 --> 01:13:38.739
- I can't handle this.
- Heck.

1163
01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:43.860
I can't do it, Rachel, I can't do it.
I thought I could, but I can't.

1164
01:13:43.884 --> 01:13:45.084
Blow out the candles, darling.

1165
01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:47.311
- What's happening?
- I'm going.

1166
01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:48.547
But it's, it's good cake.

1167
01:13:48.655 --> 01:13:51.317
Your mother got the recipe from the book
before she wrapped it.

1168
01:13:51.425 --> 01:13:52.892
I'm not gonna leave you.

1169
01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:55.791
If you respect me at all,
that's exactly what you will do.

1170
01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.340
Will you kindly tell me
what you're talking about?

1171
01:13:57.364 --> 01:13:58.695
Why is Heck being sad?

1172
01:13:58.799 --> 01:14:00.926
It's not you leaving that's gonna kill me.

1173
01:14:01.735 --> 01:14:03.635
It's you loving someone more.

1174
01:14:04.104 --> 01:14:05.435
Sorry to interrupt you.

1175
01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:08.702
Those candles are dripping wax
all over your mother's creation.

1176
01:14:08.809 --> 01:14:10.868
Will you fuck off with the fucking candles?

1177
01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.645
Yeah. Yeah.

1178
01:14:18.485 --> 01:14:21.010
No, you're not walking away.
Don't walk away from me.

1179
01:14:21.121 --> 01:14:23.715
Yeah, keep saying that.
Let me pretend this is my choice.

1180
01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:25.348
What do you mean?

1181
01:14:25.459 --> 01:14:27.837
Oh, come on, Rach, we both know
you'd have left me in the end anyway.

1182
01:14:27.861 --> 01:14:29.658
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!

1183
01:14:34.434 --> 01:14:35.434
Yes, it is.

1184
01:14:38.271 --> 01:14:39.591
You know, I want you to be happy.

1185
01:14:40.607 --> 01:14:43.440
More than anything else, I wanted
to be the cause of happiness in you.

1186
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.913
But if I'm not, then...

1187
01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:51.315
I can't stand in the way.

1188
01:14:52.319 --> 01:14:53.319
Do you see?

1189
01:14:55.355 --> 01:14:58.415
Because what you're feeling now, Rachel...

1190
01:15:01.061 --> 01:15:03.052
is the unstoppable force.

1191
01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.024
Which means that I've got to move.

1192
01:15:25.419 --> 01:15:26.419
Darling...

1193
01:15:27.054 --> 01:15:30.717
what did Heck mean when he said
you're in love with someone else?

1194
01:15:32.726 --> 01:15:34.091
I am in love with someone else.

1195
01:15:35.162 --> 01:15:38.757
Cooper. That trollop.
He'd shag an open wound.

1196
01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:41.395
Not him.

1197
01:15:42.235 --> 01:15:43.566
Who, then?

1198
01:15:43.937 --> 01:15:46.132
Well, out with it. What's his name?

1199
01:15:46.239 --> 01:15:47.263
Who is the lucky chap?

1200
01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:54.711
Her name is Luce.

1201
01:15:57.017 --> 01:15:59.542
- Luce?
- Yes.

1202
01:16:01.054 --> 01:16:02.054
Who's a woman.

1203
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:05.184
As are you a woman.

1204
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
That's right.

1205
01:16:08.862 --> 01:16:12.354
So the two of you are lesbi-friends.

1206
01:16:13.533 --> 01:16:15.933
It doesn't matter what you call it,
it's not going to happen.

1207
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.630
- Not after all this.
- Quite bloody right.

1208
01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.300
Could I say something here?

1209
01:16:29.082 --> 01:16:30.549
When I first met your mother...

1210
01:16:32.319 --> 01:16:33.650
back in the Trojan War...

1211
01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:40.421
I fell for her right off the bat.

1212
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:46.092
And although she loved me back,
she married me...

1213
01:16:48.568 --> 01:16:51.435
somehow I always knew I was...

1214
01:16:54.207 --> 01:16:56.141
never quite up to snuff.

1215
01:16:58.845 --> 01:17:02.372
We muddled along,
got through the years...

1216
01:17:04.017 --> 01:17:08.420
but I've never doubted that if she
ever met anyone she really fell for...

1217
01:17:09.856 --> 01:17:12.654
who made her realize what true love is...

1218
01:17:14.594 --> 01:17:16.858
she'd leave me like a shot...

1219
01:17:18.732 --> 01:17:20.563
and how could I argue?

1220
01:17:23.203 --> 01:17:25.865
Whatever you choose to do from here...

1221
01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.065
we'll support you, we always will.

1222
01:17:30.076 --> 01:17:32.067
But please, my darling...

1223
01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.177
follow your heart.

1224
01:17:36.716 --> 01:17:39.514
- Could I borrow your car?
- I'll drive you.

1225
01:17:42.088 --> 01:17:43.715
Nothing happens without me there.

1226
01:17:48.595 --> 01:17:49.926
You coming?

1227
01:17:52.699 --> 01:17:56.157
When we come back,
we'll talk about this if you want to.

1228
01:17:56.403 --> 01:17:57.495
Yeah.

1229
01:17:59.372 --> 01:18:01.272
Do you know what I wish?

1230
01:18:01.808 --> 01:18:03.275
That you won't grow up so fast.

1231
01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:16.880
You take care, then.

1232
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:19.185
You take care. I'm going to enjoy myself.

1233
01:18:22.062 --> 01:18:24.929
Hey. You did nothing wrong.

1234
01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:29.765
I did. Truth is, I'd do it again.

1235
01:19:09.843 --> 01:19:12.539
Why don't you have pudding
after breakfast?

1236
01:19:13.213 --> 01:19:16.774
You have it after lunch and dinner,
so why not in the morning as well?

1237
01:19:16.883 --> 01:19:18.180
I think it weird.

1238
01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:22.811
You're still sad, aren't you?

1239
01:19:25.091 --> 01:19:26.752
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1240
01:19:27.661 --> 01:19:30.892
I knew you would be. I bought you sweets.

1241
01:19:32.732 --> 01:19:35.701
Thank you. Great.

1242
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.705
I didn't know which is your favorite,
so I bought pick-and-mix.

1243
01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.748
Oh, sorry, H, sorry.

1244
01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:52.484
It's just...

1245
01:19:53.219 --> 01:19:55.244
I'm trying to do the right thing...

1246
01:19:57.657 --> 01:19:59.488
and now I think I should have not...

1247
01:20:01.661 --> 01:20:02.923
'cause...

1248
01:20:03.129 --> 01:20:06.530
if she'd stayed with me out of guilt,
that would have been fine, wouldn't it?

1249
01:20:08.001 --> 01:20:09.764
I mean, wouldn't it?

1250
01:20:10.136 --> 01:20:12.502
My math teacher, Mrs. O'Casey...

1251
01:20:12.605 --> 01:20:15.768
has something she always says
when people are sad.

1252
01:20:15.875 --> 01:20:20.039
She says, "No problem is insoluble,
given a big enough plastic bag."

1253
01:20:24.284 --> 01:20:27.776
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. She's very unusual.

1254
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:31.648
I should have married you.

1255
01:20:31.758 --> 01:20:32.952
Maybe in 10 years.

1256
01:20:33.059 --> 01:20:35.687
If you're still lonely,
we could get married then.

1257
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:39.227
You know, it's funny.

1258
01:20:40.300 --> 01:20:43.963
Ever since we first met,
I was scared that she was gonna leave me.

1259
01:20:45.071 --> 01:20:48.438
You shouldn't be afraid, Heck.
You can do anything.

1260
01:20:57.183 --> 01:20:59.845
Hurry. Hurry, please.
Take a left here.

1261
01:21:00.553 --> 01:21:03.784
I just think, if not Heck,
there must be other fish in the sea.

1262
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:04.914
Male fish.

1263
01:21:05.025 --> 01:21:06.993
- Is it straight on?
- Yes.

1264
01:21:07.293 --> 01:21:08.385
Rather exciting.

1265
01:21:08.495 --> 01:21:11.055
And what about my grandchildren?
Who'll be providing them?

1266
01:21:11.164 --> 01:21:13.257
I believe
there's a marvelous new invention...

1267
01:21:13.366 --> 01:21:15.698
- somewhat akin to the turkey baster.
- Just up here.

1268
01:21:19.406 --> 01:21:21.806
- And where did you two meet?
- At my wedding.

1269
01:21:21.908 --> 01:21:24.672
But it's such a short time.
How can you be sure?

1270
01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:26.678
I knew after three seconds.

1271
01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:30.939
I've heard of love happening that fast.
The French call it <i>Le flash.</i>

1272
01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:32.780
They would, bloody perverts.

1273
01:21:35.321 --> 01:21:37.312
Where's Luce? Is she here?

1274
01:21:37.724 --> 01:21:39.453
Would you like to try that entrance again?

1275
01:21:41.261 --> 01:21:44.025
Hello. Please, I'm looking for Luce.

1276
01:21:46.166 --> 01:21:47.656
You're her, aren't you?

1277
01:21:48.668 --> 01:21:49.794
You're the girl.

1278
01:21:52.005 --> 01:21:53.005
Yes, I am.

1279
01:21:53.706 --> 01:21:54.798
You have a husband.

1280
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:57.810
I left him.

1281
01:21:59.245 --> 01:22:00.245
He left me.

1282
01:22:01.681 --> 01:22:03.046
It doesn't matter. It's over.

1283
01:22:04.884 --> 01:22:07.478
So you're free?

1284
01:22:09.556 --> 01:22:11.751
And you love my daughter?

1285
01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:15.153
Golly.

1286
01:22:19.599 --> 01:22:21.999
Have you ever sold flowers before?

1287
01:22:28.308 --> 01:22:29.832
Watch it!

1288
01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:33.672
And what would you be wearing?

1289
01:22:33.913 --> 01:22:36.211
Oh, yeah, I like that.

1290
01:22:36.316 --> 01:22:38.648
Oh, yeah, I like that very much.

1291
01:22:39.152 --> 01:22:40.881
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

1292
01:22:40.987 --> 01:22:43.148
- Excuse me.
- Do you mind? I'm talking here.

1293
01:22:43.256 --> 01:22:45.201
Are you sure this is the best way?
'Cause the traffic's...

1294
01:22:45.225 --> 01:22:49.559
I'll meet you at home, angel.
And will you be waiting downstairs...

1295
01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:51.688
or upstairs?

1296
01:22:57.403 --> 01:23:01.134
You're quite wrong, you know.
You've always been enough for me.

1297
01:23:01.407 --> 01:23:02.407
Not recently.

1298
01:23:06.579 --> 01:23:07.876
There are pills one can take.

1299
01:23:10.183 --> 01:23:11.582
I could buy some...

1300
01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:17.048
if you could perhaps...

1301
01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:19.982
be a little kinder.

1302
01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:22.994
Yes, I could.

1303
01:23:27.133 --> 01:23:30.398
Darling, try a left up here.
It's generally quicker.

1304
01:23:31.104 --> 01:23:32.401
Well done.

1305
01:23:43.816 --> 01:23:45.010
Hang on.

1306
01:23:47.687 --> 01:23:51.646
Three cheers for my husband.
As much use as a fart in a jam jar.

1307
01:23:51.824 --> 01:23:54.224
Well, that was
the shortest honeymoon in history.

1308
01:24:09.876 --> 01:24:11.776
- Hello?
- Luce, it's me. Listen.

1309
01:24:11.878 --> 01:24:15.177
<i>- We have to talk. Everything's changed.</i>
- There's nothing to say.

1310
01:24:15.281 --> 01:24:17.647
<i>You can't do it. Bye.</i>

1311
01:24:20.486 --> 01:24:22.317
How did that go, then?

1312
01:24:22.522 --> 01:24:24.922
She'll be back.
She'll be back soon, and then you can...

1313
01:24:25.024 --> 01:24:26.616
- It's over.
- Good.

1314
01:24:28.828 --> 01:24:30.295
Well, you know what I mean.

1315
01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:38.737
That singing.

1316
01:24:44.877 --> 01:24:47.004
I heard that singing before.

1317
01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.290
What're you talking about?

1318
01:24:48.314 --> 01:24:49.354
What're you talking about?

1319
01:24:49.916 --> 01:24:51.008
Where?

1320
01:24:52.752 --> 01:24:54.811
Mind the car.

1321
01:24:54.921 --> 01:24:57.355
Yes, but... Oh, forget the car.

1322
01:25:07.433 --> 01:25:08.525
Luce!

1323
01:25:09.736 --> 01:25:10.760
Luce!

1324
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:12.235
Oh, my God.

1325
01:25:12.772 --> 01:25:13.864
Luce!

1326
01:25:14.774 --> 01:25:16.639
Luce, where are you?

1327
01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:19.271
This couldn't possibly get
more embarrassing.

1328
01:25:19.379 --> 01:25:20.437
Luce!

1329
01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:23.077
Luce, please!

1330
01:25:24.484 --> 01:25:25.542
Luce!

1331
01:25:38.931 --> 01:25:43.664
You're a wanker, Number 9!

1332
01:25:58.351 --> 01:26:00.251
Luce, I can do this!

1333
01:26:01.287 --> 01:26:03.050
I can do this!

1334
01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:18.569
Let's go and talk to her. Let's go.

1335
01:27:39.452 --> 01:27:40.646
- Hey.
- Hi.

1336
01:27:58.337 --> 01:28:00.703
Hey. Come here. Hi.

1337
01:28:01.307 --> 01:28:03.207
Hi. What're you doing?

1338
01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:05.505
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

1339
01:28:05.878 --> 01:28:07.038
Thanks.

1340
01:28:20.693 --> 01:28:23.924
Just making some notes
for this book that I'm writing.

1341
01:28:24.030 --> 01:28:26.157
- Oh, you're writing a book?
- Yeah.

1342
01:28:26.265 --> 01:28:27.357
Great.

1343
01:28:28.401 --> 01:28:30.096
Because I can read.

1344
01:28:37.443 --> 01:28:38.443
Hi.

1345
01:28:43.816 --> 01:28:45.113
It's cold.

1346
01:28:45.284 --> 01:28:46.581
