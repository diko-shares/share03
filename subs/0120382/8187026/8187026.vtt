1
00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:22.940
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phony emotions.

2
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.402
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:32.783
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit,

4
00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.662
there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.

5
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.957
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.794
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine.

7
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.963
It's a life.

8
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.760
I'm not going to make it.

9
00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:54.972
You're going to have to go on
without me.

10
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.812
No way, mister.

11
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.483
You're going to the top of this mountain,
broken legs and all.

12
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:14.157
We find many viewers leave him on
all night for comfort.

13
00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:18.161
You're crazy, you know that?

14
00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:25.627
For me, there is no difference
between a private life and a public life.

15
00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.006
My life, is my life, is The Truman Show.

16
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.425
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

17
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.844
It's a noble life. It is

18
00:01:36.722 --> 00:01:38.348
a truly blessed life.

19
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.018
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

20
00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:45.147
All right. Promise me one thing, though.

21
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:48.442
If I die before I reach the summit,

22
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.487
you'll use me
as an alternative source of food.

23
00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:54.656
Gross.

24
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.370
It's all true. It's all real.

25
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.291
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

26
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.043
It's merely controlled.

27
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.262
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.

28
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.392
Maybe just your love handles.

29
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.938
I have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.

30
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.691
Truman. You're going to be late.

31
00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:31.943
Okay!

32
00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.918
-Good morning.
-Morning.

33
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.211
Good morning.

34
00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:53.548
In case I don't see you, good afternoon,
good evening, and good night.

35
00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:55.801
Yeah.

36
00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:57.803
-Morning, Truman.
-Morning, Spencer.

37
00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.721
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.

38
00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.556
-He won't hurt you.
-Get down.

39
00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.141
I know.

40
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.519
-It's just me.
-Come on, Pluto.

41
00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:29.084
What is it?

42
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.484
Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft
in trouble began shedding parts

43
00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.654
as it flew over Seahaven
just a few moments ago.

44
00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.489
Luckily, no one was hurt.

45
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.658
But, hey, how do you feel today?

46
00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.035
That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?

47
00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:05.662
-Nope.
-No? Good.

48
00:04:05.746 --> 00:04:07.831
This is Classical Clive
with Classical Drive

49
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.292
So why don't you forget
about the perils of flying,

50
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.336
settle back,
and let this music calm you down?

51
00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.177
-Dog Fancy, please.
-Dog Fancy.

52
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:23.054
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

53
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:26.016
Give me a paper there, will you, Errol?

54
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:29.019
And one of these for the wife.

55
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.896
Loves her fashion mags.

56
00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.522
Will that be all for you, Truman?

57
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.025
-That's the whole kit and caboodle.
-Catch you later.

58
00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.110
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.619
Good morning.

60
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.789
-Hank.
-Morning, Truman.

61
00:04:49.456 --> 00:04:52.375
-Good morning, Truman.
-How are you guys?

62
00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.711
-Beautiful day, isn't it?
-Always.

63
00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.213
And how's your lovely wife?

64
00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.382
Good. How about yours?

65
00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.010
-Couldn't be better.
-Fine.

66
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.887
-Nice talking to you, Truman.
-You, too.

67
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.138
We must go now.

68
00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:08.850
Think about that policy. Okay,
that's two for one. That's a good deal.

69
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.144
-Doppelganger special.
-Right.

70
00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:12.354
Hi.

71
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.567
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.

72
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.946
-Go ahead.
-No, you first, please.

73
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.240
I'm not that anxious to get there.

74
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.381
Yes, hello.

75
00:05:39.422 --> 00:05:42.968
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.

76
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:44.886
Truman, did you see this?

77
00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:48.431
I'm sorry, ma'am.

78
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.518
If he's in a coma,
he's probably uninsurable.

79
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.647
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.

80
00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.817
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?

81
00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:01.570
Nothing listed?

82
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:05.740
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?

83
00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.450
"S" for Sylvia.

84
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.120
Nothing?

85
00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:13.707
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:51.494
-Lawrence.
-Hey, Burbank.

87
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:54.998
Got a prospect in Wells Park
I need you to close.

88
00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.793
Wells Park?

89
00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.966
-On Harbor Island?
-You know another one?

90
00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:08.845
I can't do it.
I have an appointment. Dentist.

91
00:07:11.222 --> 00:07:15.018
You're going to lose a lot more than
your teeth if you don't meet your quota.

92
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:16.686
Look, Truman,

93
00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.397
they're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

94
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:22.025
-Cutbacks?
-Yeah. Now, you need this.

95
00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:27.113
Besides, a half-hour across the bay,
a little sea air would do you good.

96
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.699
Thanks.

97
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.377
Hello.

98
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.630
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.

99
00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:45.632
One-way or return?

100
00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:47.926
Return.

101
00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:52.097
There you go, sir.

102
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:53.450
-Do you need any help, sir?
-You go ahead. I'll be fine.

103
00:08:55.035 --> 00:08:56.244
Yeah.

104
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.134
Hi, honey.

105
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.263
Look what I got free at the checkout.

106
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:20.060
It's a Chef's Pal.
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.

107
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.854
Never needs sharpening,
dishwasher-safe.

108
00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:23.938
Wow!

109
00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.608
That's amazing.

110
00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:29.027
Truman,

111
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.238
you missed a spot.

112
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.004
That is a beer.

113
00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:52.675
You know, I'm thinking
about getting out, Marlon.

114
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.677
Yeah? Out of what?

115
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.305
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.

116
00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.266
-Off this island. Out.
-Out of your job?

117
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.394
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.

118
00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:06.898
You have a desk job.
I'd kill for a desk job.

119
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:10.985
Here you go.

120
00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.488
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

121
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.157
-No, thanks.
-Now there's excitement.

122
00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.452
Don't you ever get antsy? Itchy feet?

123
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:22.789
Where's there to go?

124
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:25.750
Fiji.

125
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:29.796
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?

126
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.761
-See here?
-Yeah.

127
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.304
This is us,

128
00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.559
and all the way around here,

129
00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:44.227
Fiji.

130
00:10:45.103 --> 00:10:48.857
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

131
00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.860
You know, there are still islands in Fiji

132
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.945
where no human being
has ever set foot.

133
00:10:57.115 --> 00:10:59.325
So when are you going to go?

134
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:03.746
It's not that simple.

135
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.916
It takes money,

136
00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.169
planning.

137
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.588
I can't just up and go.

138
00:11:12.422 --> 00:11:13.590
Right.

139
00:11:14.257 --> 00:11:17.177
I'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.

140
00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:20.471
Bonus time is just around the corner.

141
00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:28.438
-You coming for a drink?
-No, I can't tonight.

142
00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.419
I don't like the look of that weather, son.
I think we should head back.

143
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:54.047
-No, Dad. Not yet.
-No, come on. We should go back.

144
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.633
-A bit farther, please?
-Son, listen.

145
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.927
-Okay.
-Yes.

146
00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:02.805
Daddy!

147
00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:20.383
You're soaked. Where have you been?

148
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.677
I figure we can
scrape together $8,000...

149
00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:24.095
Every time you and Marlon
get together...

150
00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.306
We can bum around the world
for a year on that.

151
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:30.101
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.

152
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.647
-You're talking like a teenager.
-Maybe I feel like a teenager.

153
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:37.692
We have mortgage payments, Truman.

154
00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:39.402
We have car payments.

155
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:42.572
What, we're just going to walk away
from our financial obligations?

156
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.657
It would be an adventure.

157
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:49.787
I thought we were going to try for a
baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?

158
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:53.249
That can wait. I want to get away.

159
00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:56.085
See some of the world, explore.

160
00:13:56.127 --> 00:13:59.047
Honey, you want to be an explorer?

161
00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:01.924
This'll pass.

162
00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.511
We all think like this now and then.

163
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.767
Let's get you out of these wet clothes,

164
00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:12.643
come to bed.

165
00:14:13.978 --> 00:14:16.939
You never see anything anyway.
They always

166
00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:19.942
turn the camera and play music and,

167
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.196
you know, the wind blows in,
and the curtains move

168
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.655
and you don't see anything.

169
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.913
-Dog Fancy, please.
-Dog Fancy.

170
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:34.499
Thank you.

171
00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:38.544
-Paper, Errol, please.
-Paper.

172
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:43.508
I might as well pick one of these up
while I'm at it.

173
00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:46.260
-For the wife?
-She's got to have them.

174
00:14:46.886 --> 00:14:49.972
-Anything else, Truman?
-That's the whole ball of wax.

175
00:14:50.473 --> 00:14:52.350
-Catch you later.
-Okay.

176
00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.288
Dad?

177
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.335
What are you doing?

178
00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:22.672
What the... Get out of the way!

179
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.340
Stop them!

180
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:28.469
Stop those people!

181
00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:34.934
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!

182
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:38.187
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!

183
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.232
Somebody, stop the bus!

184
00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:57.623
And wasn't it funny...

185
00:16:03.588 --> 00:16:06.299
It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.

186
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:10.261
I see him 10 times a week
in 100 different faces.

187
00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:14.265
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon last Thursday.

188
00:16:14.348 --> 00:16:17.935
It was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.

189
00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.979
And you know what else was strange?

190
00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.064
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

191
00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.734
came out of nowhere
and forced him onto a bus.

192
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.612
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown

193
00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.406
before we become
just like the rest of the country.

194
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.075
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...

195
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:34.160
God!

196
00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:37.497
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him,
it was his twin.

197
00:16:38.956 --> 00:16:43.002
-Did Dad have a brother?
-Truman, you know perfectly well

198
00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:47.757
that your father was an only child,
just like you.

199
00:16:50.468 --> 00:16:52.011
Now, sweetie,

200
00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.848
you're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

201
00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:00.061
You, sailing off into that storm.

202
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.775
But I've never blamed you, Truman,

203
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.903
and I don't blame you now.

204
00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.367
Truman?

205
00:18:00.413 --> 00:18:02.623
What are you doing down here?

206
00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.751
Fixing the mower.

207
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:11.632
-Saw my father today.
-I know.

208
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.721
Your mother called.

209
00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:21.350
You really shouldn't upset her like that.

210
00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.020
Did you want... What did you want?

211
00:18:24.395 --> 00:18:26.022
I made macaroni.

212
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.190
I'm not hungry.

213
00:18:28.983 --> 00:18:32.612
You know, you really ought to throw out
that mower.

214
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.198
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

215
00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.403
What's he doing?

216
00:19:14.487 --> 00:19:17.490
See, they got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

217
00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:19.241
The memory of who?

218
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.296
-You okay? You all right?
-Excuse me. Hi.

219
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.632
-Hi.
-I'm so sorry I fell on you like that.

220
00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:19.802
-It's okay.
-I've just been such a klutz all day.

221
00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:21.429
It's all right.

222
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.515
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

223
00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:28.477
-I'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
-That's all right. Don't worry about it.

224
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:30.980
-I'm Meryl.
-Hi, I'm Truman.

225
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.481
Hey, nice to meet you.

226
00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:02.488
-Truman, you've studied enough.
-No. I got to commit this to memory.

227
00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:04.573
Come on, Truman,
one ice-cold brewski.

228
00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:05.908
Come on.

229
00:22:06.408 --> 00:22:09.703
You're going to have to copy off me,
so be careful.

230
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.375
You're a better person than I am.

231
00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:15.709
-See you later.
-Okay.

232
00:22:15.751 --> 00:22:17.127
-Bye.
-Bye.

233
00:22:17.962 --> 00:22:19.755
See you later, loser.

234
00:23:20.524 --> 00:23:21.567
Hi.

235
00:23:26.488 --> 00:23:29.366
-Konnichi-wa.
-What?

236
00:23:29.992 --> 00:23:31.660
You take Japanese.

237
00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.163
Yes.

238
00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:38.709
Lauren, right?

239
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:40.419
It's on the...

240
00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:43.631
Lauren. Right.

241
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:46.800
I'm Truman Burbank.

242
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:49.511
Yeah, I know.

243
00:23:50.471 --> 00:23:53.098
You know, Truman,
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

244
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:54.350
Really?

245
00:23:57.144 --> 00:24:00.814
Yeah. I can understand that.
I'm a pretty dangerous character.

246
00:24:00.856 --> 00:24:03.067
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

247
00:24:03.943 --> 00:24:06.028
A girl's got to be careful.

248
00:24:08.864 --> 00:24:12.034
-You have a boyfriend, right?
-No, it's not that.

249
00:24:12.076 --> 00:24:15.621
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...

250
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:18.165
We're just friends.

251
00:24:18.207 --> 00:24:20.876
-It's nothing like that.
-It's how I look?

252
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.461
Not your type?

253
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.505
No.

254
00:24:26.507 --> 00:24:27.508
I like your pin.

255
00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:30.886
I was wondering that myself.

256
00:24:32.388 --> 00:24:34.890
Would you want to maybe, possibly,

257
00:24:35.391 --> 00:24:38.894
sometime go out
for some pizza or something?

258
00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.604
Like, Friday?

259
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.065
-Saturday?
-I can't.

260
00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:45.109
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

261
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.241
-We have finals tomorrow.
-Yeah, I know.

262
00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:55.911
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

263
00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:00.416
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?

264
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.578
Please keep your hands inside the car!

265
00:25:54.887 --> 00:25:57.389
This is my favorite pizza place.

266
00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.474
Tony!

267
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.642
One large, extra plankton.

268
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:04.730
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.

269
00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:07.816
-Who are?
-They don't want me talking to you.

270
00:26:08.275 --> 00:26:09.902
Then don't talk.

271
00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:25.626
They're here.

272
00:26:26.919 --> 00:26:28.504
-Truman.
-What do they want?

273
00:26:28.545 --> 00:26:30.672
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

274
00:26:30.756 --> 00:26:32.508
Everybody knows everything you do.

275
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:34.551
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?

276
00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.220
-Everybody's pretending.
-I don't know.

277
00:26:36.303 --> 00:26:38.222
No, my name's not Lauren. It's Sylvia.

278
00:26:38.305 --> 00:26:39.640
-My name's Sylvia.
-Sylvia?

279
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:42.059
-Yeah.
-Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

280
00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:45.062
-Wait a minute. Who are you?
-I'm her father.

281
00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:48.065
-I've never even seen him before.
-We weren't doing anything.

282
00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.943
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.

283
00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:55.781
Everything I've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. It's all for you.

284
00:26:55.864 --> 00:26:58.700
-I don't understand.
-The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.

285
00:26:58.742 --> 00:26:59.785
It's a show.

286
00:26:59.868 --> 00:27:02.204
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

287
00:27:02.287 --> 00:27:04.456
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.

288
00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.543
-I want to know what's going on.
-Schizophrenia. She has episodes.

289
00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:08.919
We've tried everything.

290
00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:12.381
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.

291
00:27:12.422 --> 00:27:14.508
-Truman!
-You're not the first.

292
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.928
You're not the first. She brings
all her boyfriends down here.

293
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:20.597
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.

294
00:27:21.515 --> 00:27:23.892
-Get out of here. Come and find me.
-Don't worry.

295
00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:27.396
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.

296
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.564
Fiji?

297
00:27:40.576 --> 00:27:41.743
Sylvia!

298
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:42.828
Hey!

299
00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:54.923
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

300
00:27:54.965 --> 00:27:59.428
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.

301
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.263
Maybe he's too kind.

302
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:04.516
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

303
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.934
Excuse me.

304
00:28:06.018 --> 00:28:07.269
Come on, Sal.

305
00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:10.439
We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

306
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.565
Can I borrow that?

307
00:28:58.654 --> 00:29:00.530
Close, but no cigar.

308
00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:31.561
And it's another beautiful day
in paradise, folks,

309
00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:34.398
but don't forget to buckle up
out there in radioland.

310
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.608
Remember, a good driver...

311
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.077
...wait for the cue.

312
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.372
Stand by, one.

313
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:52.791
Countdown to action.

314
00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:54.418
Stand by, one.

315
00:29:57.421 --> 00:30:00.507
He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.

316
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:04.886
He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.

317
00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.931
Okay, he's making his turn
onto Lancaster Square.

318
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:12.561
Oh, my Goa! He nearly hit her.

319
00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:14.730
Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.

320
00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:21.903
Sorry about that, folks.

321
00:30:21.945 --> 00:30:24.323
I guess we picked up
a police frequency or something.

322
00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:27.284
It sometimes happens,
and it can drive you crazy.

323
00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:29.536
Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here

324
00:30:29.578 --> 00:30:32.164
and we've still got
some great music up ahead,

325
00:30:32.247 --> 00:30:33.498
but don't forget to buckle up.

326
00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:36.209
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

327
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:38.378
A safe driver is what? Yes...

328
00:30:54.353 --> 00:30:55.896
Morning, ma'am.

329
00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:37.998
-I love that idea.
-It's pretty cool, isn't it?

330
00:33:42.521 --> 00:33:43.772
Can I help?

331
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:46.233
Yeah. I have an appointment
at Gable Enterprises.

332
00:33:46.274 --> 00:33:47.776
They went bust.

333
00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.950
-What's happening?
-Nothing.

334
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:58.203
-Just tell me what's happening.
-Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.

335
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:00.288
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?

336
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.082
It's none of your business!

337
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:04.626
If you don't tell me what's happening,
I'll report you!

338
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:06.461
You're trespassing.

339
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:38.910
Marlon.

340
00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:42.247
-Truman. What are you doing here?
-I got to talk to you.

341
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.165
It's a bad time, okay? I'm way behind.

342
00:34:44.249 --> 00:34:46.793
I'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.

343
00:34:46.918 --> 00:34:50.005
-You okay? You look like shit.
-I think I'm mixed up in something.

344
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:51.131
Mixed up in what?

345
00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:52.966
There's no point trying to explain it,

346
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:56.136
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

347
00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:03.268
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.

348
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:05.854
I looked out. There was people there.

349
00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:09.190
And on the radio on the way to work,
it starts following me along,

350
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:10.984
talking about everything that I'm doing.

351
00:35:11.026 --> 00:35:13.695
-Know what I mean?
-Truman, this is one of your fantasies...

352
00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:15.196
I think this is about my dad.

353
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.532
-Your dad?
-I think he's alive.

354
00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:22.370
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
I'm definitely being followed.

355
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:23.872
Who?

356
00:35:25.707 --> 00:35:29.127
It's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.

357
00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:36.051
-How about those two?
-I don't know. Could be.

358
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:40.889
It's when I'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.

359
00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.643
-Did anything happen?
-No.

360
00:35:45.101 --> 00:35:46.936
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?

361
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.897
-No. I just came here.
-Come on.

362
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.732
I told you I can't.

363
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:56.905
You're going to get both our asses fired,
you know that?

364
00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:59.157
-Okay, man, let's do it.
-What?

365
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.368
Whatever you say, I'm game.

366
00:36:01.409 --> 00:36:03.912
-What are you talking about?
-Yes, sirree.

367
00:36:04.037 --> 00:36:06.581
Your birthday comes but once a year.

368
00:36:09.626 --> 00:36:12.253
Maybe I'm being set up for something.

369
00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:14.464
You ever think about that, Marlon?

370
00:36:14.547 --> 00:36:17.634
Like your whole life
has been building toward something?

371
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:18.760
No.

372
00:36:21.137 --> 00:36:23.765
When you were hauling chickens
in the summer for Kaiser,

373
00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.434
what was the furthest
you ever got off the island?

374
00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:29.938
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.

375
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:34.275
Look at that sunset, Truman.
It's perfect.

376
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:36.277
Yeah.

377
00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:38.947
That's the big guy.

378
00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:42.867
-Quite a paintbrush he's got.
-Yep.

379
00:36:46.996 --> 00:36:49.457
Just between you and me, Marlon,

380
00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:53.086
I'm going away for a while.

381
00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.589
-Really?
-Yeah.

382
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.051
Little angel.

383
00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:08.143
My little clown.

384
00:37:10.353 --> 00:37:11.855
Old carrot top.

385
00:37:12.605 --> 00:37:14.274
The best of both of us.

386
00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.653
We should be
getting you home, Mother.

387
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:22.157
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

388
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.576
Do you remember, Truman,
when Dad was still with us?

389
00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:28.079
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.

390
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.498
It looks so small.

391
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.834
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

392
00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:34.335
Look, Truman.

393
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:37.213
The happiest day of our lives. Look.

394
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:42.093
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.

395
00:37:42.177 --> 00:37:44.679
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?

396
00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.182
She still does.

397
00:37:47.265 --> 00:37:50.018
And there's lots of pages left over
for baby photos.

398
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:53.605
I would like to hold a grandchild
in my arms before I go.

399
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:56.441
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

400
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:59.027
-I'll take her.
-No. You stay, relax.

401
00:37:59.068 --> 00:38:00.820
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.

402
00:38:00.862 --> 00:38:01.905
You sure?

403
00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:03.907
Besides, we have something
to discuss.

404
00:38:04.866 --> 00:38:08.536
-A certain person's birthday.
-I see.

405
00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.625
And there'll be another episode of
I Love Lucy same time tomorrow.

406
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:16.544
But right now,
it's time for Golden Oldies.

407
00:38:16.586 --> 00:38:19.255
Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic,

408
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:21.424
Show Me the Way to Go Home.

409
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:23.718
A hymn of praise to small-town life,

410
00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:26.095
where we learn
that you don't have to leave home

411
00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:30.809
to discover what the world's all about,
and that no one is poor who has friends.

412
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:35.855
Full of laughter and love, pain and
sadness, but ultimately redemption,

413
00:38:35.897 --> 00:38:38.608
we share the trials and tribulations
of the Abbott family.

414
00:38:38.691 --> 00:38:41.611
Note the touching performance
of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.

415
00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:44.322
That scene with the bowl of cherries
is going to have you

416
00:38:44.405 --> 00:38:47.283
splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.

417
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:51.371
And there'll be tears, too,
when David and Jennifer are reunited.

418
00:38:51.412 --> 00:38:55.250
But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.

419
00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.362
Thank you, sweetie.

420
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:31.619
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

421
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:36.416
-Sweetie, I'd love to, but I'm really late.
-What's your rush?

422
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:38.877
surgery.

423
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.422
There was that elevator disaster
downtown. It was on the news last night.

424
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.173
This cable just snapped.

425
00:39:44.257 --> 00:39:46.801
This elevator,
it just plummeted down 10 flights.

426
00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:49.387
The non-union workers. Just monsters.

427
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.098
That building, it's right next door
to where you work.

428
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.142
Can you imagine
if you had been in there?

429
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.810
It's not even worth thinking about.

430
00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:58.813
Anyway, I have an amputation
on one of the young women

431
00:39:58.855 --> 00:40:02.400
who was in that elevator.
She's very young. It's very sad.

432
00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:05.904
-Anyway, wish me luck.
-I'll cross my fingers for you.

433
00:40:48.196 --> 00:40:51.366
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?

434
00:40:53.034 --> 00:40:57.205
Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

435
00:40:57.246 --> 00:41:00.625
I'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

436
00:41:01.417 --> 00:41:04.045
Sure. Okay, fine.

437
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.131
-Can you pass along a message?
-I'll try.

438
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:10.927
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji,
and that I'll call her when I get there?

439
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.722
-When you get to Fiji?
-You got it.

440
00:41:14.764 --> 00:41:18.226
-Fine. I'll tell her.
-Thank you so much.

441
00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:46.921
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

442
00:41:48.131 --> 00:41:50.466
Here, let me help you with that.

443
00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.139
He's here.

444
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.559
I know.

445
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:01.811
Scalpel.

446
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:12.155
I'm now making my primary incision

447
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.825
just above the right knee.

448
00:42:18.828 --> 00:42:19.829
Hold her.

449
00:42:20.913 --> 00:42:22.290
Nicely done.

450
00:42:22.832 --> 00:42:25.668
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family...

451
00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.254
It's just beautiful. Beautiful job.

452
00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:32.633
I'll just let someone else tidy up here.

453
00:42:57.283 --> 00:42:59.827
-I'm sorry to keep you.
-That's okay.

454
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:05.666
-How can I help?
-I would like to book a flight to Fiji.

455
00:43:07.835 --> 00:43:10.004
When would you like to leave?

456
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:12.131
Today.

457
00:43:29.899 --> 00:43:33.528
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

458
00:43:33.986 --> 00:43:36.531
-A month?
-It's the busy season.

459
00:43:38.783 --> 00:43:40.910
You want to book the flight?

460
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:45.456
It doesn't matter.
I'll make other arrangements, okay?

461
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.587
Last call for Chicago!

462
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:54.340
All aboard!

463
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.805
Thank you.

464
00:44:03.724 --> 00:44:05.726
Windy city, here we come.

465
00:44:07.812 --> 00:44:09.063
-Hi.
-Hi.

466
00:44:12.567 --> 00:44:14.360
Hello. Hi.

467
00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:17.405
Sisters.

468
00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:21.200
-Mom, isn't that...
-Face the front.

469
00:44:48.644 --> 00:44:51.147
Everybody off. We've got a problem.

470
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:12.251
I'm sorry, son.

471
00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.809
His father was from Chicago,
wasn't he?

472
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:32.813
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.

473
00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:34.982
But how come he wants to go
to Chicago?

474
00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:37.652
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

475
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.820
He has to have it out with Meryl.

476
00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:57.004
Truman?

477
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:05.513
-Honey, are you okay?
-Get in.

478
00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:10.351
Truman.

479
00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:12.770
Look.

480
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:17.525
What?

481
00:46:18.693 --> 00:46:21.362
I predict that in just a moment,

482
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:27.159
we will see a lady on a red bike,
followed by a man with flowers

483
00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.205
and a Volkswagen Beetle
with a dented fender.

484
00:46:31.497 --> 00:46:33.582
-Truman, please.
-Look.

485
00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.589
Lady,

486
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:43.426
flowers,

487
00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:46.721
and...

488
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:52.143
-Truman, this is silly.
-There it is!

489
00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:54.562
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

490
00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:04.572
Don't you want to know how I did that?
I'll tell you.

491
00:47:04.613 --> 00:47:07.074
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.

492
00:47:07.116 --> 00:47:10.953
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.

493
00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:12.413
Round and round.

494
00:47:12.496 --> 00:47:14.874
I invited Rita and Marlon
for a barbecue on Sunday.

495
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:17.418
-I'm gonna make my potato salad.
-I won't be here Sunday.

496
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.420
I need you to remind me
we need more charcoal.

497
00:47:19.503 --> 00:47:22.381
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

498
00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:27.928
You're upset because
you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?

499
00:47:30.348 --> 00:47:31.766
Okay, go.

500
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:37.772
I think you should save for
a few months, and then go.

501
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.608
There. Are you happy now?

502
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.443
I'm going to go take a shower.

503
00:47:45.279 --> 00:47:46.822
Let's go now.

504
00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:49.950
I'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.

505
00:47:50.034 --> 00:47:52.661
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?

506
00:47:54.497 --> 00:47:56.832
Truman, what are you doing?

507
00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.171
Truman!

508
00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:06.092
Where shall we go?

509
00:48:07.468 --> 00:48:09.720
-Truman, where are we going?
-I don't really know.

510
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:12.014
I guess I'm being spontaneous.

511
00:48:12.598 --> 00:48:15.976
Somebody, help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

512
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:18.562
Forget Fiji.

513
00:48:18.646 --> 00:48:21.524
-Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
-No.

514
00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:27.822
-What about Atlantic City?
-No, you hate to gamble.

515
00:48:27.905 --> 00:48:30.950
-That's right, I do, don't I?
-So why would you want to go there?

516
00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:35.204
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?

517
00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:39.792
-Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
-Me, too.

518
00:48:48.217 --> 00:48:50.594
Blocked at every turn.

519
00:48:51.762 --> 00:48:53.639
Beautifully synchronized,
don't you agree?

520
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:56.684
-You're blaming me for the traffic?
-Should I?

521
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:07.069
Truman, let's go home.

522
00:49:07.987 --> 00:49:11.198
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

523
00:49:11.282 --> 00:49:13.659
It could be like this
all the way to Atlantic City.

524
00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:15.202
Let's go back.

525
00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:19.248
I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

526
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.962
Can you please slow down?

527
00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.256
Yes, I can.

528
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:32.553
-Truman, that's our turnoff.
-I changed my mind again.

529
00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:36.056
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardi Gras!

530
00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:46.317
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.

531
00:49:46.442 --> 00:49:47.818
It's magic.

532
00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:51.447
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.

533
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:53.866
You want to destroy yourself,
you do it on your own.

534
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:56.076
I think I'd like a little company.

535
00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:06.795
Truman, you knew this would happen.

536
00:50:08.047 --> 00:50:10.925
You know you can't drive over water.

537
00:50:11.258 --> 00:50:13.844
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.

538
00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.557
-Give me your hand.
-Sweetie.

539
00:50:19.433 --> 00:50:20.601
Drive.

540
00:50:21.185 --> 00:50:22.394
Truman!

541
00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:25.940
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!

542
00:50:26.148 --> 00:50:27.733
-Oh, my!
-You can do it.

543
00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:29.818
-Please, don't!
-You can make it.

544
00:50:30.194 --> 00:50:31.445
Truman.

545
00:50:32.363 --> 00:50:33.489
We're over.

546
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:36.909
-We're over the bridge.
-We're over?

547
00:50:37.493 --> 00:50:39.537
-We're over the bridge.
-We're over.

548
00:50:45.417 --> 00:50:47.211
Truman, what about that sign?

549
00:50:47.294 --> 00:50:49.922
I'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

550
00:50:51.507 --> 00:50:53.968
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

551
00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:55.970
-Truman, let's go back!
-Can't go back!

552
00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:58.681
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

553
00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:00.224
-It's okay.
-We're on fire!

554
00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:02.226
It's okay. It's just smoke.

555
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:03.811
-You okay?
-Yes.

556
00:51:04.019 --> 00:51:05.980
-Want to do it again?
-No!

557
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:10.317
Truman, stop! Oh, God!

558
00:51:12.278 --> 00:51:16.282
So what are we going to do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

559
00:51:17.116 --> 00:51:19.326
I have my Seahaven bank card.

560
00:51:20.035 --> 00:51:23.747
So what? We're just gonna eat
into our savings, is that it?

561
00:51:24.331 --> 00:51:26.875
I'm going to have to call your mother
when we get there.

562
00:51:26.959 --> 00:51:31.463
She's going to be worried sick. I don't
know how she's going to take this.

563
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:44.435
What now?

564
00:51:45.853 --> 00:51:47.479
This is a red alert.

565
00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:53.193
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.

566
00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:55.446
Back up. Leak at the plant.

567
00:51:55.529 --> 00:51:57.948
-We had to shut her down.
-Is there any way around?

568
00:51:58.032 --> 00:52:00.701
-Whole area's being evacuated.
-Is there anything I can do?

569
00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.786
-No, ma'am.
-Thank you for your help.

570
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.538
You're welcome, Truman.

571
00:52:05.914 --> 00:52:07.291
Truman.

572
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:11.670
Truman!

573
00:52:12.087 --> 00:52:13.756
Truman, come back!

574
00:52:16.258 --> 00:52:17.676
Stop him!

575
00:52:19.053 --> 00:52:20.387
Truman!

576
00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:22.514
Catch him on the left!

577
00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.407
Stay away!

578
00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:47.831
No.

579
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.378
...now in custody.

580
00:52:55.756 --> 00:52:59.593
Thank you both so much for your help.
I really appreciate it.

581
00:52:59.927 --> 00:53:03.597
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

582
00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:05.099
I understand.

583
00:53:05.432 --> 00:53:07.601
-Thanks again.
-Good night.

584
00:53:25.411 --> 00:53:27.996
Let me get you some help, Truman.

585
00:53:28.747 --> 00:53:30.332
You're not well.

586
00:53:32.793 --> 00:53:35.504
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

587
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.340
You can't stand me.

588
00:53:38.799 --> 00:53:40.384
That's not true.

589
00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:47.808
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

590
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.145
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

591
00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:52.980
No artificial sweeteners.

592
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:55.566
What the hell are you talking about?

593
00:53:56.108 --> 00:53:57.985
Who are you talking to?

594
00:53:58.026 --> 00:54:01.071
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

595
00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:04.950
What the hell does this have to do
with anything?

596
00:54:05.743 --> 00:54:07.745
Tell me what's happening!

597
00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:11.415
You're having a nervous breakdown,
that's what's happening.

598
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:13.667
You're part of this, aren't you?

599
00:54:15.878 --> 00:54:17.838
-Truman.
-Meryl!

600
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:20.966
You are scaring me.

601
00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:23.635
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

602
00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:27.848
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

603
00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:30.350
There are so many choices!

604
00:54:31.185 --> 00:54:32.770
Do something!

605
00:54:34.062 --> 00:54:35.189
What?

606
00:54:35.981 --> 00:54:37.816
What did you say?

607
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.320
-Who were you talking to?
-Nothing. I didn't say anything.

608
00:54:41.361 --> 00:54:43.030
I didn't say anything.

609
00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:46.450
-You said "do something."
-No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.

610
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:49.870
-Talk to me!
-I don't know anything. Please stop.

611
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.538
Stay where you are.

612
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:54.208
Truman?

613
00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:56.919
Truman.

614
00:54:57.544 --> 00:55:01.215
Oh, thank God!

615
00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:09.139
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions?

616
00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:11.433
It's unprofessional.

617
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:13.685
It's okay.

618
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:20.818
Everything's going to be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

619
00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.532
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

620
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:32.913
Maybe I'm losing my mind, but...

621
00:55:37.209 --> 00:55:40.587
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

622
00:55:42.965 --> 00:55:45.634
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

623
00:55:47.803 --> 00:55:49.930
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

624
00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:53.350
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

625
00:55:54.226 --> 00:55:56.436
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

626
00:55:56.478 --> 00:55:59.189
had an imaginary interview
on Seahaven Tonight?

627
00:55:59.648 --> 00:56:02.526
-Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
-This is different.

628
00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:04.611
Everybody seems to be in on it.

629
00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:12.452
I've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

630
00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:14.746
The only way you and I
ever made it through school

631
00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:17.457
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

632
00:56:18.458 --> 00:56:20.335
Jesus, they were identical.

633
00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:24.840
But I always felt safe knowing that.

634
00:56:25.841 --> 00:56:28.886
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

635
00:56:29.136 --> 00:56:30.971
and we were wrong together.

636
00:56:32.598 --> 00:56:35.642
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

637
00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.020
because you wanted to play North Pole?

638
00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:40.188
And I got pneumonia?

639
00:56:42.232 --> 00:56:43.650
You remember that?

640
00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:46.987
You were out of school for
about a month.

641
00:56:53.327 --> 00:56:56.163
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

642
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:04.254
I know that things

643
00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:09.509
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

644
00:57:10.469 --> 00:57:14.306
I know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

645
00:57:15.557 --> 00:57:17.684
and you don't want to believe it,

646
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.979
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

647
00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:29.029
The point is,

648
00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:32.366
I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

649
00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:42.209
The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.

650
00:57:43.377 --> 00:57:46.630
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

651
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:51.635
And the last thing that I would ever do

652
00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:55.764
is lie to you.

653
00:57:59.059 --> 00:58:01.061
I mean, think about it, Truman.

654
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.313
If everybody is in on it,

655
00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:07.985
I'd have to be in on it, too.

656
00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:19.246
I'm not in on it, Truman, because

657
00:58:20.622 --> 00:58:21.999
there is no "it."

658
00:58:26.128 --> 00:58:28.505
You were right about one thing, though.

659
00:58:29.256 --> 00:58:30.549
What's that?

660
00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:34.302
The thing that started all this.

661
00:58:49.776 --> 00:58:52.529
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

662
00:58:52.946 --> 00:58:54.823
That's why I came by tonight.

663
00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:58.118
I'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.

664
00:59:01.955 --> 00:59:03.290
Go to him.

665
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.423
Easy on the fog.

666
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.135
Stand by, crane cam.

667
00:59:16.595 --> 00:59:17.971
Crane cam.

668
00:59:25.979 --> 00:59:27.314
Button cam 3.

669
00:59:39.826 --> 00:59:41.912
I never stopped believing.

670
00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.001
And wide, curb cam 8.

671
00:59:48.668 --> 00:59:49.836
My son.

672
00:59:51.671 --> 00:59:53.632
-Move in for a close-up?
-No.

673
00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:57.052
Move back

674
00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.679
and fade up music.

675
01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.104
And now go in close.

676
01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:10.273
All those years wasted.

677
01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:15.821
I'll make it up to you, son. I swear.

678
01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.161
Dad.

679
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.705
Yes!

680
01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.633
Bravo.

681
01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.219
That will win the ratings period.

682
01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.054
Congratulations.

683
01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:43.223
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

684
01:00:43.265 --> 01:00:45.058
-Great television.
-That was good work.

685
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.936
Let's get some champagne up here.

686
01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:49.479
Congratulations.

687
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:54.484
-Well done, Christof.
-It was brilliant. It just broke my heart.

688
01:00:58.196 --> 01:00:59.865
-Well done, everyone!
-Bravo!

689
01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.199
Congratulations.

690
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.554
1.7 billion were there for his birth.

691
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:29.686
220 countries tuned in for his first step.

692
01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:33.565
The world stood still for that stolen kiss.

693
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.276
And as he grew, so did the technology.

694
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.111
An entire human life

695
01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.323
recorded on an intricate network
of hidden cameras

696
01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:45.285
and broadcast live and unedited,
24 hours a day,

697
01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:48.496
seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.

698
01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:52.125
Coming to you now
from Seahaven island,

699
01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:55.587
enclosed in the largest studio
ever constructed,

700
01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:57.923
and along with the Great Wall of China,

701
01:01:57.964 --> 01:02:01.301
one of only two manmade structures
visible from space,

702
01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.222
now in its 30th great year,

703
01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.349
it's The Truman Show.

704
01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.813
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you,

705
01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:15.857
I was on pins and needles
the entire time.

706
01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:19.152
Hello and good evening.
I'm your host Mike Michaelson,

707
01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:20.612
and welcome to Trutalk.

708
01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:23.156
Our forum for issues growing
out of the show.

709
01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.825
But tonight,
something very special indeed.

710
01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:30.205
A rare and exclusive interview
with the show's conceiver and creator.

711
01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:34.292
So come with us now as we go live
to the lunar room

712
01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.754
on the 221st floor
of the omni-cam ecosphere.

713
01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:41.424
That's where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary.

714
01:02:41.675 --> 01:02:44.594
The designer and architect
of the world within a world

715
01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.763
that is Seahaven Island: Christof.

716
01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:51.101
Before we begin, I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our audience,

717
01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.019
for granting this exclusive interview.

718
01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:55.355
We know how demanding
your schedule is

719
01:02:55.397 --> 01:02:58.316
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.

720
01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.652
This, sir, is indeed an honor.

721
01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:02.195
Don't mention it.

722
01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:05.198
The catalyst for the recent
dramatic events on the show

723
01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.367
has been Truman's father, Kirk,

724
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.870
and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that,

725
01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:13.623
I think it's worth noting
this is not the first time

726
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:17.043
someone from the outside
has attempted to reach Truman, is it?

727
01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:19.004
We have had our close calls in the past.

728
01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:22.132
Truman! It's television! Yes!

729
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:26.052
Yes! I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

730
01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.888
But there's never been anything
to compare with

731
01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:30.974
this most recent breach in security.

732
01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:34.185
The first intruder
to be a former cast member.

733
01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:35.979
A dead one at that.

734
01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:39.607
Got to say, writing Kirk back in,
masterstroke.

735
01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.569
Since Kirk started this whole crisis
in Truman's life,

736
01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:45.989
I came to the conclusion that he was
the only one who could end it.

737
01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:47.198
Truman!

738
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.533
Truman, nol!

739
01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:50.744
That's off-limits.

740
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:54.497
-Why? What's over there?
-Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.

741
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.000
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

742
01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:01.171
But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.

743
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:04.674
As Truman grew up,
we were forced to manufacture ways

744
01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.468
to keep him on the island.

745
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.471
I'd like to be an explorer,
like the great Magellan.

746
01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.056
You're too late.

747
01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.516
There's really nothing left to explore.

748
01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.690
Finally, I came up with the concept
of Kirk's drowning.

749
01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.902
Most effective. Truman's been
terrified of the water ever since.

750
01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:26.780
When Kirk read the synopsis
for the Death At Sea episode,

751
01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:30.325
he was disappointed, to say the least.

752
01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:34.037
I'm sure that's what caused him
to break back onto the set.

753
01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.457
But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?

754
01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.628
-Amnesia.
-Brilliant.

755
01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.297
Let's take some viewer phone calls.

756
01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:47.300
Charlotte, North Carolina,
you're on with Christof.

757
01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:49.803
Yeah, hi, Christof.

758
01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:53.640
I was just wondering how many
cameras you got there in that town.

759
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.184
Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.

760
01:04:56.601 --> 01:05:01.314
-That's a lot of cameras.
-Remember, we started with just one.

761
01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.110
He was curious from birth.

762
01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.781
Premature by two weeks. It was almost
as if he couldn't wait to get started.

763
01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.158
And his eagerness to leave
his mother's womb

764
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.702
was the very reason he was the one
who was selected.

765
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.497
In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies,

766
01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.375
the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,

767
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.836
Truman was the one who
arrived on cue.

768
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.510
Incidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child

769
01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.054
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.

770
01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.305
That's correct.

771
01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:36.766
The show has generated
enormous revenues,

772
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.103
now equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.

773
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.354
People forget it takes

774
01:05:41.396 --> 01:05:44.149
the population of an entire country
to keep the show running.

775
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:47.861
Since the show is on 24 hours a day
without commercial interruption,

776
01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:51.531
all those staggering revenues
are generated by product placement.

777
01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:54.242
That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.

778
01:05:54.325 --> 01:05:57.662
From the actors' wardrobe, food
products, to the very homes they live in.

779
01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.039
All of it available
in the Truman catalog

780
01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.541
and operators are standing by.

781
01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.334
Christof, let me ask you.

782
01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:07.046
Why do you think
that Truman has never come close

783
01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:10.633
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?

784
01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:14.179
We accept the reality of the world
with which we are presented.

785
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.889
It's as simple as that.

786
01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.141
The Hague for Christof.

787
01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.393
Hello? The Hague?

788
01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.523
All right, we've lost that call. Let's go
to Hollywood. You're on Trutalk.

789
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:28.193
Hi, I'd just like to say one thing.

790
01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:29.944
You're a liar and a manipulator.

791
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:32.322
And what you've done to Truman
IS Sick.

792
01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.992
We remember this voice, don't we?

793
01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.746
-How could we forget?
-Let's go to another call.

794
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:43.124
No. It's fine, Mike.

795
01:06:43.583 --> 01:06:46.461
I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.

796
01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:48.963
Sylvia,

797
01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.759
as you announced
so melodramatically to the world,

798
01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:57.305
you think because you batted your eyes
at Truman once,

799
01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.141
flirted with him,

800
01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.769
stole a few minutes of airtime with him

801
01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:06.064
to thrust yourself and your politics
into the limelight,

802
01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:09.734
that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?

803
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.737
You really think you're in a position
to judge him?

804
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.989
What right do you have to take a baby

805
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.951
and turn his life
into some kind of mockery?

806
01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.537
Don't you ever feel guilty?

807
01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.959
I have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.

808
01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:30.338
The world, the place you live in,

809
01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:32.840
is the sick place.

810
01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.053
Seahaven is the way
the world should be.

811
01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:40.807
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!

812
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.642
He could leave at any time.

813
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:45.353
If his was more than
just a vague ambition,

814
01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:49.023
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,

815
01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:52.443
there's no way we could prevent him.

816
01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.405
I think what distresses you,

817
01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:59.659
really, caller, is that ultimately

818
01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.497
Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.

819
01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.666
That's where you're wrong.

820
01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:09.877
You're so wrong,
and he'll prove you wrong.

821
01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:14.507
Aside from the heated comments
of a very vocal minority,

822
01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:17.427
it's been
an overwhelmingly positive experience.

823
01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:20.013
Yes. For Truman
and for the viewing public.

824
01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.015
Christof, I can't thank you enough

825
01:08:22.056 --> 01:08:24.517
for giving so generously
of your time tonight.

826
01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:27.520
I think it's safe to say that
now that this crisis is behind us

827
01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.230
and that Truman's back to his old self,

828
01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:32.692
we can look forward
to some exciting new developments.

829
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.070
Mike, the big news is
that Meryl will be leaving Truman

830
01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:37.739
in an upcoming episode.

831
01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:40.533
And a new romantic interest
will be introduced.

832
01:08:41.159 --> 01:08:45.496
I'm determined that television's first
on-air conception will still take place.

833
01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:49.959
Another television milestone
Straight ahead. You heard it here first.

834
01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:52.795
It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure, sir.

835
01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.423
-Christof, thank you.
-Thank you, Mike.

836
01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:15.503
-Simeon.
-What?

837
01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.467
Is he looking at us?

838
01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.845
Jesus, do you think he knows?

839
01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.264
Hello?

840
01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:28.307
Better call Christof.

841
01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.435
Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.

842
01:10:42.613 --> 01:10:43.614
Jesus.

843
01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:50.872
-He's back to his old self.
-Thank God.

844
01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:01.174
That's an unusual cat, my man.

845
01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:09.307
I hereby proclaim this planet...

846
01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.856
Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.

847
01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.694
-Is he gonna go?
-Okay, hallway camera ready.

848
01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:24.906
That one's for free.

849
01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:26.991
Keep up with him,
‘cause he'll move fast.

850
01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:29.160
Stand by, all house cameras.

851
01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.413
-Morning!
-Good morning.

852
01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.248
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

853
01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.042
In case I don't see you...

854
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.628
Good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

855
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.466
-Good afternoon...
-Good morning.

856
01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.635
...evening and good night.

857
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.471
-Morning, Truman.
-Morning, Spencer.

858
01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.807
-How's it going?
-Let me check.

859
01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.142
Vital signs are good.

860
01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.771
Pluto!

861
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.981
Good morning, Truman.

862
01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:01.776
-Look who's here.
-Beautiful day, isn't it?

863
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.236
Every single day.

864
01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:06.239
The policy, we've thought about it
and we're gonna take it.

865
01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:07.573
-You're kidding?
-No!

866
01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.409
Why don't we go up to my office
right now and we'll sign the papers?

867
01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:13.120
Next week would be much better.

868
01:12:13.204 --> 01:12:16.415
-All right. See you guys.
-Okay, bye now. See you next week.

869
01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.210
-Give me something to look forward to.
-You got it.

870
01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.962
See, this isn't about insurance.

871
01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.550
This is about the great variable:
when will death occur?

872
01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.969
Could be a week, a month, a year.

873
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.263
Could be today.

874
01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.809
"Sunbather, minding his own business,

875
01:12:35.643 --> 01:12:38.729
"stabbed in the heart by the tip
of a runaway beach umbrella."

876
01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:41.357
No way to guard against
that kind of thing.

877
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:44.986
Sorry, excuse me.

878
01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.530
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.

879
01:12:47.613 --> 01:12:49.907
The two of you
are gonna be neighbors.

880
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:57.707
I guess what I'm saying is that life is

881
01:12:58.499 --> 01:12:59.750
fragile.

882
01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.129
-Vivien, your office.
-Sorry.

883
01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:06.257
What's that? I'm sorry.

884
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.426
You do?

885
01:13:09.302 --> 01:13:12.305
Great. Let me take your information.

886
01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:30.197
Ready, 2. Go to 2.

887
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:36.162
And back to medium.

888
01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.540
And wide.

889
01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:50.343
I was just trying to train the kid to...

890
01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:52.553
Never mind.

891
01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.808
What's he doing in the basement?

892
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.645
He moved down there
after Meryl packed up and left.

893
01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.063
Why wasn't I told?

894
01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.857
Any unpredictable behavior
has to be reported.

895
01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.152
He's just sleeping, I thought.

896
01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.780
-This the best shot we've got?
-What's to see?

897
01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.450
-What's on the clock cam?
-It's an obstruction.

898
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:18.704
-What happened down there?
-He was just tidying up his garbage.

899
01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:23.709
I was gonna call you, but halfway
through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.

900
01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:27.213
I wanna check on the setups
for the insurance convention tomorrow.

901
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.673
-Yes.
-Yeah.

902
01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.008
Nice move.

903
01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.394
There you go.

904
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.698
Isolate the audio.

905
01:14:55.032 --> 01:14:57.034
Give me a close-up on his torso.

906
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:01.414
He's still breathing.

907
01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:05.251
Where's Chloe? Call him.

908
01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.754
-What do you want me to say?
-Tell him it's a wrong number.

909
01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.759
What took you so long?

910
01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.762
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.

911
01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.099
Here. What's going on?

912
01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:22.685
I don't know. They're...

913
01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.855
He came down into the room. He did
nothing but stand around for a while.

914
01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:27.398
Shut up and watch it.

915
01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.109
Then we went to night vision.

916
01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.319
He's asleep.

917
01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.197
-There!
-What?

918
01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.366
-Zoom in.
-On which?

919
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.285
Under the chair there.

920
01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.080
Enhance it.

921
01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.127
-Is it...
-My God.

922
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.090
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.

923
01:15:53.132 --> 01:15:54.759
-Get Marlon over there.
-Right away.

924
01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:11.650
Truman!

925
01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:13.819
Surprise party!

926
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.156
Come on, buddy.

927
01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:20.493
I got a six-pack of cold brewskis
with our name on them.

928
01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.912
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.

929
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.000
Shit.

930
01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:33.798
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.

931
01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:40.137
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

932
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.014
That's good. Keep it light.

933
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:45.351
I know you're in here.
I'm gonna find you.

934
01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.523
Check under the table.

935
01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.567
The closet, behind you.

936
01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:58.572
Huh.

937
01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:01.367
Gee.

938
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:04.453
I wonder where he could possibly be.

939
01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.630
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.

940
01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:25.015
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.

941
01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:26.183
He's gone.

942
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.561
-Cut transmission!
-Cut transmission?

943
01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:29.895
Cut it!

944
01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.108
Jesus! God in heaven!

945
01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:38.028
-Everything's black.
-Give me the phone.

946
01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.085
I don't know where he is, but he's gone.

947
01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:02.595
All right. We've got
every available extra looking for him.

948
01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:06.932
The principals are helping out. The
crew, too. So every sector's covered.

949
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.352
-What about prop cars?
-Yes, they've been accounted for.

950
01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:11.854
He has to be on foot.

951
01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.815
He has the world's most
recognizable face. He can't disappear.

952
01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:51.810
Go.

953
01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:56.273
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.

954
01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.108
Good dog!

955
01:18:58.150 --> 01:18:59.401
All this fuss.

956
01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:02.238
If he could just hear my voice.

957
01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:04.406
Truman!

958
01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.828
Let me try. Truman!

959
01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:12.957
It's me, Dad!

960
01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.502
Let's talk.

961
01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.672
Yeah, I know.

962
01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.300
Just about done with the square.

963
01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:25.970
Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

964
01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.222
-He's got to be in there.
-Barrymore.

965
01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.808
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

966
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:31.850
I don't know.

967
01:19:31.934 --> 01:19:34.270
-Send somebody over there, okay?
-All right.

968
01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.901
Take another man
and get down there now, all right?

969
01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:43.237
I don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.

970
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.321
Get some batteries.

971
01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:47.116
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.

972
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.868
I don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.

973
01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.163
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

974
01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.837
What time is it?

975
01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:02.464
It's way too early for that.

976
01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.389
Cue the sun.

977
01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:18.314
What time is it?

978
01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.066
Christof, what's going on?

979
01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:24.570
Did you know there's a rumor
circulating that he's dead?

980
01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.779
You hear me?

981
01:20:25.863 --> 01:20:28.198
The media is having a feeding frenzy
over this.

982
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.034
All the phone lines are jammed,

983
01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.702
and every network has a pirated shot

984
01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:34.038
of Marlon making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

985
01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.290
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

986
01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:37.791
Why? We're getting higher ratings
with this graphic

987
01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.961
than we've ever had on this show.

988
01:20:43.881 --> 01:20:45.174
No sign of him.

989
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.135
Marlon, why don't you head back to town
and join the others?

990
01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:51.180
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.

991
01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:54.933
Everyone's at first positions, right?

992
01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:13.827
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.

993
01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.332
We're not watching the sea.

994
01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.959
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

995
01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:22.961
Sweep the harbor.

996
01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:24.630
Bring up the harbor cameras.

997
01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.091
Shift all harbor cameras to computer,
please.

998
01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:28.801
Some of those are out, aren't they?

999
01:21:28.842 --> 01:21:32.304
Yeah. We have four of them down,
but we have the lighthouse cameras up.

1000
01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.807
-All buoy cams, please.
-What's happening?

1001
01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.601
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.

1002
01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:39.686
-Why are we looking at the water?
-Good.

1003
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.605
Pan and zoom please.

1004
01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.318
Truman,

1005
01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.947
where are you going?

1006
01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.826
How can he sail? He's in insurance.

1007
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:56.370
-Isn't he terrified of the water?
-Resume transmission.

1008
01:21:56.453 --> 01:21:58.038
Resuming transmission.

1009
01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:06.422
-I got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
-I want a piece of that.

1010
01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.549
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.

1011
01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.678
Just leave them in the car.

1012
01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:29.570
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't
see his face. Go to the cabin cam.

1013
01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.116
There. Perfect.

1014
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.618
That's our hero shot.

1015
01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.062
Let's get another boat out there.

1016
01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:07.399
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk
to the guys on the ferry.

1017
01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:09.985
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1018
01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:13.489
Come on.

1019
01:23:14.072 --> 01:23:17.701
-I'm usually the bus driver.
-Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.

1020
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:19.244
They're actors.

1021
01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.125
How do we stop him?

1022
01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:36.762
Okay.

1023
01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:42.893
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1024
01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.813
So hold onto your hats. You got that?

1025
01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:51.944
No. I think we're gonna want to localize
the storm over the boat.

1026
01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:56.990
You can get the coordinates for that.

1027
01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:59.743
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1028
01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:02.079
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.

1029
01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:06.875
Thar she blows.

1030
01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.888
Come on.

1031
01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.122
Give me some lightning.

1032
01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:47.374
Again.

1033
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.167
Hit him again!

1034
01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:03.181
For God's sake,
the whole world is watching.

1035
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.392
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1036
01:25:05.475 --> 01:25:07.311
He was born in front of a live audience.

1037
01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:37.758
Come on, Truman!

1038
01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.680
You can do it! Hold on!

1039
01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:11.041
Is that the best you can do?

1040
01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:15.712
You're gonna have to kill me!

1041
01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:19.132
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?

1042
01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:21.802
-I demand that you cease transmission.
-Keep running.

1043
01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:26.223
What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?

1044
01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:28.975
Increase the wind.

1045
01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:33.897
-I'm telling you for the last time.
-How close is he?

1046
01:26:33.939 --> 01:26:35.399
-Very close.
-Capsize him. Tip him over.

1047
01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:38.360
-Damn you, Christof!
-You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!

1048
01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:39.444
Shut up!

1049
01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:41.279
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1050
01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:42.531
-Do it.
-No.

1051
01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:43.615
Do it!

1052
01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:39.504
That's enough.

1053
01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:52.090
I want to talk to him.

1054
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:12.277
Truman.

1055
01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:15.363
You can speak.

1056
01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.783
I can hear you.

1057
01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:24.456
Who are you?

1058
01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:27.125
I am the creator of a television show

1059
01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:30.170
that gives hope and joy and inspiration
to millions.

1060
01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:36.342
Then who am I?

1061
01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:38.136
You're the star.

1062
01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:45.602
Was nothing real?

1063
01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.479
You were real.

1064
01:32:48.938 --> 01:32:51.232
That's what made you so good to watch.

1065
01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:53.485
Listen to me, Truman.

1066
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:55.779
There's no more truth out there

1067
01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:59.491
than there is in the world
I created for you.

1068
01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:02.994
The same lies,

1069
01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:06.039
the same deceit.

1070
01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.416
But in my world

1071
01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:12.003
you have nothing to fear.

1072
01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.884
I know you better than
you know yourself.

1073
01:33:17.967 --> 01:33:20.095
You never had a camera in my head.

1074
01:33:21.888 --> 01:33:23.139
You're afraid.

1075
01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.226
That's why you can't leave.

1076
01:33:30.897 --> 01:33:32.315
It's okay, Truman.

1077
01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.692
I understand.

1078
01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:38.988
I have been watching you
your whole life.

1079
01:33:41.783 --> 01:33:43.910
I was watching when you were born.

1080
01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.873
I was watching
when you took your first step.

1081
01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:55.672
I watched you on your first day
of school.

1082
01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:01.094
The episode when you lost
your first tooth.

1083
01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:07.267
You can't leave, Truman.

1084
01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:10.311
Please, God.

1085
01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:11.855
You belong here...

1086
01:34:12.063 --> 01:34:13.273
You can do it.

1087
01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:16.401
...with me.

1088
01:34:18.903 --> 01:34:20.238
Talk to me.

1089
01:34:21.573 --> 01:34:22.824
Say something.

1090
01:34:27.245 --> 01:34:30.373
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.

1091
01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:32.750
You're live to the whole world.

1092
01:34:50.435 --> 01:34:52.228
In case I don't see you,

1093
01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.940
good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

1094
01:34:59.152 --> 01:35:00.195
Yeah.

1095
01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:24.719
Yeah!

1096
01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:37.482
-He made it! Yeah!
-All right, Truman!

1097
01:35:47.325 --> 01:35:49.827
-Cease transmission.
-Ceasing transmission.

1098
01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:56.834
-You want another slice?
-No. I'm okay.

1099
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:59.545
What else is on?
Where's the TV Guide?
