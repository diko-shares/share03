Truman himself.

5
00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:40.958
No scripts, no cue cards.

00:52:56.799 --> 00:53:00.594
Thank you both so much for your help.
I really appreciate it.

692
00:53:00.928 --> 00:53:04.598
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

693
00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:06.141
I understand.

694
00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:08.602
-Thanks again.
-Good night.

Let me get you some help, Truman.

696
00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:31.375
You're not well.

697
00:53:33.836 --> 00:53:36.547
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

698
00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.383
You can't stand me.

699
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.427
That's not true.

700
00:53:46.098 --> 00:53:48.809
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

701
00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:52.146
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

702
00:53:52.229 --> 00:53:53.981
No artificial sweeteners.

703

704
00:53:57.151 --> 00:53:58.986
Who are you talking to?

705
00:53:59.069 --> 00:54:02.197
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

706
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.993

-Meryl!

You are scaring me.

712
00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:24.678
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

713
00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:28.891
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

714
00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:30.809

I don't know what to think, Marlon.

Maybe I'm losing my mind, but...

736
00:55:38.252 --> 00:55:41.588
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:46.677
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

738
00:55:48.846 --> 00:55:50.931
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

739
00:55:51.348 --> 00:55:54.393
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

740
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:57.437
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

741
00:55:57.521 --> 00:56:00.232
had an imaginary interview
on <i>Seahaven Tonight?</i>

742
00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:03.527
-Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
-This is different.

743

Everybody seems to be in on it.

744
00:56:09.992 --> 00:56:13.453
I've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

745
00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.622
The only way you and I
ever made it through school

746
00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:18.333
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

747
00:56:19.501 --> 00:56:21.378
Jesus, they were identical.

748
00:56:23.672 --> 00:56:25.883
But I always felt safe knowing that.

749
00:56:26.884 --> 00:56:29.928
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

750
00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:31.972
and we were wrong together.

751
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:36.685
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

752
00:56:36.768 --> 00:56:39.062
because you wanted to play North Pole?

753
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.231
And I got pneumonia?

754
00:56:43.275 --> 00:56:44.651
You remember that?

755
00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:47.988
You were out of school for
about a month.

756
00:56:54.369 --> 00:56:57.164
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

757
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.297
I know that things

758
00:57:06.465 --> 00:57:10.552
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

759
00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:15.349
I know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

760
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.727
and you don't want to believe it,

761
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:22.064
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

762

CHRISTOF: The point is,

763
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.408
I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

<i>The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.</i>

765
00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:47.673
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

766
00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:52.678

767

768
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.062
I mean, think about it, Truman.

If everybody is in on it,

770
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:09.027
I'd have to be in on it, too.

(SIGHING)

772
00:58:18.078 --> 00:58:20.247
I'm not in on it, Truman, because

773
00:58:21.665 --> 00:58:23.041
there is no "it."

774
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.548
You were right about one thing, though.

775
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:31.591
What's that?

776
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:35.345

777
00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:53.572
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

779
00:58:56.742 --> 00:58:59.119

780
00:59:02.956 --> 00:59:04.291
Go to him.

864

<i>MIKE: Most effective. Truman’s been
terrified of the water ever since.</i>
