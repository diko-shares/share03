There is no year
for sherry, 007.

108
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:09.466
I was referring to
the original vintage

109
00:09:09.476 --> 00:09:10.892
on which
the sherry is based, sir.

110
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:13.892

111
00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:17.424

00:09:17.434 --> 00:09:18.507
Precisely.

113
00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:20.341
Tell me, Commander,

114
00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:22.674
how far does your
expertise extend

115
00:09:22.684 --> 00:09:26.091
into the field of diamonds?

116
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:28.549
Well, hardest substance
found in nature.

117
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:30.466
They cut glass,
suggest marriage.

118
00:09:30.476 --> 00:09:34.424
I suppose they've replaced
a dog as a girl's best friend.
And that's about it.

119
00:09:34.434 --> 00:09:37.382
Refreshing to hear
there's one subject
you're not an expert on.

120
00:09:37.392 --> 00:09:39.299
Yes, well, perhaps
I'd better give you

121
00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:42.674
a brief background
into our problem.

122
00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:44.716
Eighty percent
of the world's diamonds

123
00:09:44.726 --> 00:09:46.882
come from mines
in South Africa.

124
00:09:46.892 --> 00:09:47.841
Most are dug out
of shafts

125
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:50.674
of diamond-bearing clay

126
00:09:50.684 --> 00:09:53.132
at depths of
up to 3,000 feet.

127
00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:55.382
The whole process
from start to finish

128
00:09:55.392 --> 00:09:57.799
operates under
an airtight
security system.

129
00:09:57.809 --> 00:09:59.549
It's an essential
precaution,

130
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:02.341
even though
the industry
prides itself

131
00:10:02.351 --> 00:10:04.559
on the loyalty
and devotion
of its workers.

132
00:10:06.392 --> 00:10:10.049
Naturally, the security
measures tend to
ensure that loyalty,

133
00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.591
as do the
extensive amenities

134
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.757
and social services
we provide.

135
00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:18.257
There's a permanent staff
of doctors, nurses,
even dentists

136
00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:20.632
and the whole process,
from start to finish,

137
00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:24.091
operates under
an airtight
security system.

138
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:25.257
It's a necessary
precaution,

139
00:10:25.267 --> 00:10:28.007
even though the
industry prides itself

140
00:10:28.017 --> 00:10:29.257
on the loyalty
and devotion
of its workers.

Dr. Tynan.
Good evening.

146
00:11:11.684 --> 00:11:13.716
Who are you
and where is Joe?

147
00:11:13.726 --> 00:11:15.007
Joe couldn't
make it tonight.

148
00:11:15.017 --> 00:11:19.184
I'm Mr. Wint.
This is Mr. Kidd.

149
00:11:22.392 --> 00:11:23.559
Oh, I see.

151
00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:41.382
What's the matter
with him?

152
00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:44.049
It's my wisdom teeth.
I haven't had them
out yet.

153
00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:47.257
Would you mind
having a look, Doctor?

154
00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:48.924
Of course.
I'm not going
to hurt you.

155
00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:50.934
Just open.
No, no, no. Open wide.

(SCREAMS)

157
00:12:05.142 --> 00:12:10.007
Curious how everyone
who touches
those diamonds

158
00:12:10.017 --> 00:12:10.892
seems to die.

159
00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:26.799
PILOT: Stop right there!
Who are you?

160
00:12:26.809 --> 00:12:27.882
Dr. Tynan sent us.

161
00:12:27.892 --> 00:12:29.632
Why didn't he
come himself?

162
00:12:29.642 --> 00:12:30.591
He was taken sick.

163
00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.591
Bitten by the bug.

164
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:35.017
He sent this
for you.

165
00:12:46.976 --> 00:12:49.549
If God had wanted
man to fly...

166
00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:52.809
He would have
given him wings,
Mr. Kidd.

167
00:13:03.934 --> 00:13:05.382
Of course,
no security system is perfect.

168
00:13:05.392 --> 00:13:09.716
We've always accepted
a percentage of smuggling.

169
00:13:09.726 --> 00:13:10.757
But over the past
two years,

170
00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:11.799
despite all
our precautions,

171
00:13:11.809 --> 00:13:14.049
it's gone up
alarmingly.

172
00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:15.382
Even more alarming
is the fact

173
00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:17.299
that none of the stones
have reached the market.

174
00:13:17.309 --> 00:13:18.674
Sir Donald thinks
someone's stockpiling.

175
00:13:18.684 --> 00:13:21.591
What concerns us
is the possibility
of someone

176
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:25.007
either dumping the stones
on the market

Making you
agree to
perpetual blackmail.

178
00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:28.726
Exactly.

179
00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:34.716
What we need
to know is who

180
00:13:34.726 --> 00:13:36.132
the stockpilers are.

181
00:13:36.142 --> 00:13:41.174
The letter "u"
is for "umbrella".

182
00:13:41.184 --> 00:13:42.466
We take it lest it rain.

183
00:13:42.476 --> 00:13:46.684
We hope we shan't want it
till we're home again.

184
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:48.934

to see you, Missy.

185
00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:52.799
Gentlemen?
I shan't be long,
children.

186
00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:53.976
Joshua's going
to read you a story.

187
00:13:55.809 --> 00:13:59.716
How nice to see you again.

188
00:13:59.726 --> 00:14:01.174
Where to this time?

189
00:14:01.184 --> 00:14:02.466
Amsterdam.

190
00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:04.799
Amsterdam! Oh, how lovely.

191
00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:06.882
I shall have to bring
back some pictures
of the canals

192
00:14:06.892 --> 00:14:08.007
for the children.

shall receive,
Mrs. Whistler.

194
00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:16.267
Thus endeth
the lesson
for today, gentlemen.

195
00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:22.299
Several recent murders
in South Africa
have complicated matters.

196
00:14:22.309 --> 00:14:24.924
If they shut down
operations before
we discover them...

197
00:14:24.934 --> 00:14:28.132
It would be
catastrophic for us

198
00:14:28.142 --> 00:14:29.716
and for the government.

199
00:14:29.726 --> 00:14:32.674
Well, I've always
rather fancied a trip
to South Africa.

200
00:14:32.684 --> 00:14:34.642
You're going to Holland.

201
00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.341
For some time now

202
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:38.632
we've had our eyes
on a professional smuggler

203
00:14:38.642 --> 00:14:39.841
called Peter Franks.

204
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:41.757
He's due to leave
for Amsterdam.

205
00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:43.757
Do we know who
his contacts are?

206
00:14:43.767 --> 00:14:46.226
We do function
in your absence, Commander.

207
00:14:50.892 --> 00:14:51.851
A passport, sir.

208
00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.841
Ah, Mr. Franks.
There's a message for you
at Passport Control.

209
00:14:58.851 --> 00:14:59.757
Now, that door
over there.

210
00:14:59.767 --> 00:15:02.049

your car outside.

Mr. Franks. Your passport
is quite in order.

215
00:15:35.142 --> 00:15:36.716
Well, anyone seeing you
in that outfit, Moneypenny,

216
00:15:36.726 --> 00:15:41.049
would most certainly
be discouraged
from leaving the country.

217
00:15:41.059 --> 00:15:43.007
What can I bring you back
from Holland?

218
00:15:43.017 --> 00:15:44.851
A diamond. In a ring.

219
00:15:50.017 --> 00:15:51.684

for a tulip?

Yes.

Ahead is one of the
oldest bridges in Amsterdam.

The Skinny Bridge.

223
00:16:20.642 --> 00:16:25.341
It was built over
300 years ago by two sisters

224
00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:26.757
who wanted to visit
each other every day.

225
00:16:26.767 --> 00:16:28.841
Unfortunately,
they ran out of money,

226
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:32.382
so that is why it is called
the Skinny Bridge.

227
00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:34.257
On your right,
those beautiful old houses

228
00:16:34.267 --> 00:16:38.799
can be seen
in the paintings of our
famous painter Rembrandt.

229
00:16:38.809 --> 00:16:40.549
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:43.591
if you will look to your left
as we down the Amstel,

231
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:45.757
you can see...

232
00:16:45.767 --> 00:16:46.851
Oh!

233
00:16:56.142 --> 00:16:58.257
Mrs. Whistler did want
some pictures
of the canals

234
00:16:58.267 --> 00:16:59.299
for the children.

235
00:16:59.309 --> 00:17:01.559
How kind of you,
Mr. Kidd.

236
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:04.976
The children
will be so thrilled.

237
00:17:30.184 --> 00:17:33.591

247
00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:15.507
Definitely distinctive.

248
00:18:15.517 --> 00:18:18.132
I was born there
on the first floor

249

was looking
for a wedding ring.

Well, I'm glad
for your sake

it wasn't

252
00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:31.466
Weren't you a blond
when I came in?

253
00:18:31.476 --> 00:18:33.299
Could be.

254
00:18:33.309 --> 00:18:35.632
I tend to notice
little things like that,

00:18:35.642 --> 00:18:38.174
whether a girl is
a blond or a brunette.

256
00:18:38.184 --> 00:18:39.017
And which
do you prefer?

257
00:18:40.392 --> 00:18:45.007
Well, providing the collars
and the cuffs match...

about that later.

That's quite a nice
little nothing
you're almost wearing.

262
00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:23.424
I approve.

263
00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:25.924
I don't dress
for the hired help.

264
00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:27.976

isn't it?

273
00:20:29.226 --> 00:20:31.174
But it is in need
of some soft lighting,

274
00:20:31.184 --> 00:20:33.007
and I know
a little restaurant
quite close...

275
00:20:33.017 --> 00:20:35.299
I never mix business
with pleasure.

276
00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:36.632
Well, neither do I.

277
00:20:36.642 --> 00:20:40.257

by saving the cute remarks

283

Fifty thousand carats.

284
00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:53.507
Well, 142 carats
an ounce.

285
00:20:53.517 --> 00:20:54.924

of ice.

286

it was going to be,

I'm looking

I haven't got anything
in Baja.

1222
01:38:06.851 --> 01:38:09.674
MAN ON RADIO:
There is still no official
government explanation

1223
01:38:09.684 --> 01:38:12.132
of the apparent simultaneous
nuclear accidents

1224
01:38:12.142 --> 01:38:13.424
in North Dakota and Russia.

1225
01:38:13.434 --> 01:38:15.091
Presidential News Secretary
John Fenner

1226
01:38:15.101 --> 01:38:18.424
has refused comment
on an unconfirmed report

1227
01:38:18.434 --> 01:38:20.049
that an emergency meeting
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1228
01:38:20.059 --> 01:38:22.632
is in session
at this very moment.

1229
01:38:22.642 --> 01:38:24.549
It is believed
that the United States
and the Soviet Union

1230
01:38:24.559 --> 01:38:26.549
have assured each other
over the hotline

1231
01:38:26.559 --> 01:38:29.882
that no offensive action
has been taken
by either nation.

1232
01:38:29.892 --> 01:38:32.049
Reports of another nuclear
accident in Red China

1233
01:38:32.059 --> 01:38:34.799
are as yet unconfirmed.

1234
01:38:34.809 --> 01:38:36.466
We will bring you
further reports...

1235
01:38:36.476 --> 01:38:38.591
Two more submarines
have taken up position
not 10 miles away.

1236
01:38:38.601 --> 01:38:39.924
Are those
military aircraft

1237
01:38:39.934 --> 01:38:41.049
going to
stand off forever?

1238
01:38:41.059 --> 01:38:42.966
What if they won't
accept our ultimatum?

1239
01:38:42.976 --> 01:38:44.841
What if they decide
to attack?

1240
01:38:44.851 --> 01:38:46.799
Calm yourself, Metz.

1241
01:38:46.809 --> 01:38:48.757
This farcical show of force
was only to be expected.

1242
01:38:48.767 --> 01:38:51.216
Yes...
The great powers

1243
01:38:51.226 --> 01:38:52.674
flexing their
military muscles

1244
01:38:52.684 --> 01:38:54.757
like so many
impotent beach boys.

1245
01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:58.007
I deeply regret my threat
to destroy a major city

1246
01:38:58.017 --> 01:39:00.924
unless they give in,
but there it is.

1247
01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.341
The nuclear powers,
like all bullies,

1248
01:39:02.351 --> 01:39:04.757
can only be
intimidated by force.

1249
01:39:04.767 --> 01:39:08.507
But how can you...
There's still an hour
left for them to reply.

1250
01:39:08.517 --> 01:39:09.924
One hour
for both of us

1251
01:39:09.934 --> 01:39:11.091
to achieve
our common dream.

1252
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:14.184
Total disarmament
and peace for the world.

1253
01:39:16.809 --> 01:39:18.132
Sir, there's
a single plane
approaching.

1254
01:39:18.142 --> 01:39:19.841

1255
01:39:19.851 --> 01:39:21.642
Two miles,
and closing.

1256
01:39:24.267 --> 01:39:26.674
Stage one alert, please.

1257

The Acme Pollution Inspection.

1267
01:40:39.226 --> 01:40:40.549
We're cleaning up the world.

1268
01:40:40.559 --> 01:40:42.809
We thought this was
a suitable starting point.

1269
01:41:14.642 --> 01:41:16.174
How disappointing.

1270
01:41:16.184 --> 01:41:18.216
I was expecting
one Head of State
at the very least.

1271
01:41:18.226 --> 01:41:20.466
Surely you haven't come
to negotiate, Mr. Bond.

1272
01:41:20.476 --> 01:41:24.591
Your pitiful little island
hasn't even been threatened.

1273
01:41:24.601 --> 01:41:27.841
Search him from his
toenails to the last
follicle on his head

1274
01:41:27.851 --> 01:41:29.684
and then bring him to me.

(MARCH PLAYING)

1276
01:41:54.767 --> 01:41:56.892
I do so hate martial music.

1277
01:41:59.892 --> 01:42:03.007
And as usual, Mr. Bond,
you were absolutely right.

1278
01:42:03.017 --> 01:42:06.091
You guessed correctly
that box contained

1279
01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:08.257
the master satellite
control tape

1280
01:42:08.267 --> 01:42:12.132
and you came aboard
presumably hoping
to substitute this

1281
01:42:12.142 --> 01:42:13.726
for the real thing.

1282
01:42:16.642 --> 01:42:19.382
I'm so sorry
to have ruined the line
of your suit

1283
01:42:19.392 --> 01:42:20.267
for nothing.

1284
01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:25.216
BOND: Talking about lines,
which one did you use
on Miss Case?

1285
01:42:25.226 --> 01:42:28.507
Miss Case has taken
a terribly reasonable
attitude about all this.

1286
01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:29.716
Like any sensible animal,

1287
01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:32.101
she's only threatening
when she's threatened.

1288
01:42:33.309 --> 01:42:36.049
It appears that you're holding
all the aces,

1289
01:42:36.059 --> 01:42:38.132

to the dragon lady over here.

1290
01:42:38.142 --> 01:42:40.382
BLOFELD: Jealousy? From you,
Mr. Bond?

1291
01:42:40.392 --> 01:42:41.767
I'm flattered.

1292
01:42:42.976 --> 01:42:44.216
As La Rochefoucauld
observed,

1293
01:42:44.226 --> 01:42:49.091
"Humility is the worst
form of conceit."

1294
01:42:49.101 --> 01:42:50.799
I do hold a winning hand.

1295
01:42:50.809 --> 01:42:52.424
Why don't you
let me take you

1296
01:42:52.434 --> 01:42:54.767
on a little tour
of our facilities.

1297
01:42:56.267 --> 01:42:58.601
Your chance
to see the real tape
once again.

1298
01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:00.892
TIFFANY: Can I
tag along, Ernst?

1299
01:43:03.392 --> 01:43:07.017
I'd put something on
over that bikini first,
my dear.

1300
01:43:08.142 --> 01:43:09.341
I've come too far
to have the aim
of my crew

1301
01:43:09.351 --> 01:43:11.809
affected by the sight
of a pretty body.

1302
01:43:13.017 --> 01:43:13.892
No word yet
from anyone.

1303
01:43:16.309 --> 01:43:18.591
Only 12 minutes left.

1304
01:43:18.601 --> 01:43:21.017
Oh, well, I suppose
a little gentle prodding
is called for.

1305
01:43:23.351 --> 01:43:26.007
As you see, Mr. Bond,

1306
01:43:26.017 --> 01:43:29.101
the satellite
is at present over Kansas.

1307
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:32.757
Well, if we destroy Kansas,

1308
01:43:32.767 --> 01:43:35.507
the world may not hear
about it for years.

1309
01:43:35.517 --> 01:43:38.674
Perhaps New York.
All that smut and traffic.

1310
01:43:38.684 --> 01:43:41.424
Would give them a chance
for a fresh start.

1311
01:43:41.434 --> 01:43:44.174
Washington, D.C. Perfect.

1312
01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.882
Since we have not
heard from them,

1313
01:43:45.892 --> 01:43:47.549
they will hear from us.

1314
01:43:47.559 --> 01:43:49.966
See to it, Metz.
Washington?

1315
01:43:49.976 --> 01:43:51.632
Right.

1316
01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:56.341
And this presumably
is the control bank
with the coded tape.

1317
01:43:56.351 --> 01:43:58.841
Right again, Mr. Bond.

1318
01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:01.174
All satellites
are controlled by
a coded tape.

1319
01:44:01.184 --> 01:44:03.174
The trick is, of course,
to have the code.

1320
01:44:03.184 --> 01:44:07.299
Obviously. It all seems
so perfectly simple.

1321
01:44:07.309 --> 01:44:10.267
I suppose
one just presses that
and out it pops.

1322
01:44:14.517 --> 01:44:15.424
Put it back, Mr. Bond.

1323
01:44:15.434 --> 01:44:16.892
Immediately.

1324
01:44:25.226 --> 01:44:26.966
Hi, Ernst!

1325
01:44:26.976 --> 01:44:28.966
Is Superman giving you
any trouble?

1326
01:44:28.976 --> 01:44:30.851
Put it back
very carefully.

1327
01:44:37.476 --> 01:44:38.799
You've certainly become
tiresome, Mr. Bond.

just to make sure.

I'll wire M you're on
your way home.

Don't tell him which
direction we've taken.

If you're having

let the captain know,

1430

There's something
very important

1433
01:54:57.559 --> 01:55:00.642
I've been meaning
to ask you about us.

1434
01:55:01.601 --> 01:55:02.757
Oh?

the girl's not
supposed to be
the one to ask,

1437
01:55:07.017 --> 01:55:08.476
but I can't help it.

1438
01:55:09.601 --> 01:55:11.892

before answering.

01:55:13.601 --> 01:55:15.726

1457
01:56:12.309 --> 01:56:13.716
But then there
would be no surprise,

1458
01:56:13.726 --> 01:56:15.716
would there, madam?

to be seated?

1460
01:56:16.309 --> 01:56:17.882

This will just take
a moment

1462
01:56:20.476 --> 01:56:22.101
and then we will
leave you in peace.

Wine, sir?

1464
01:56:25.226 --> 01:56:26.934
Mouton Rothschild, '55.

1467
01:56:43.934 --> 01:56:47.257
A happy selection,
if I may say.

1468
01:56:47.267 --> 01:56:48.341
I'll be the judge of that.

1469
01:56:48.351 --> 01:56:49.841
That's rather potent.

1470
01:56:49.851 --> 01:56:52.091
Not the cork, your aftershave.

1471
01:56:52.101 --> 01:56:52.851
Strong enough
to bury anything.

1472
01:56:59.267 --> 01:56:59.934

is quite excellent.

Although, for such
a grand meal,

1474
01:57:02.892 --> 01:57:04.934
I had rather
expected a claret.

1475
01:57:06.142 --> 01:57:08.007
WINT: Of course.

1476
01:57:08.017 --> 01:57:11.601
Unfortunately, our cellar
is rather poorly stocked
with clarets.

1477
01:57:13.392 --> 01:57:15.476
Mouton Rothschild is a claret.

1478
01:57:17.059 --> 01:57:20.091
And I've smelled
that aftershave before.

1479
01:57:20.101 --> 01:57:21.059
And both times,
I've smelled a rat.
