1
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:17,272
l am Arwen - l've come to help you.

2
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,852
Hear my voice...

3
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,636
Come back to the light.

4
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,589
Stay with the Hobbits -
l'll send horses for you.

5
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,920
l'm the faster rider - l'll take him

6
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:01,519
The Road is too dangerous.

7
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,876
lf l can get across the river...

8
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,348
...the power of my people
will protect him.

9
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,509
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.

10
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,916
Not over you... not over me.

11
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:06,912
Do you remember when we first met?

12
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,977
l thought l had strayed into a dream.

13
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,289
Long years have passed.

14
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,871
You did not have the cares you carry now.

15
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:27,836
Do you remember what l told you?

16
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:46,639
Sit down, Legolas.

17
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,435
She wanted to protect her child...

18
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:20,230
she thought in Rivendell
you would be safe.

19
02:31:13,709 --> 02:31:15,919
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.

20
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:20,270
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.

21
02:31:22,948 --> 02:31:24,888
Aragorn of the Dunedain...

22
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:26,541
you are known to us.

23
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:56,777
You are being tracked.

24
02:50:49,164 --> 02:50:50,951
For her love,

25
02:50:50,952 --> 02:50:56,724
l fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar
will diminish.

26
02:50:57,984 --> 02:51:01,436
l would have her leave these shores,

27
02:51:01,925 --> 02:51:04,723
and be with her people.

28
02:51:07,044 --> 02:51:13,118
l would have her take the ship to Valinor.

29
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:39,337
Farewell.

30
02:51:43,569 --> 02:51:46,200
There is much you have yet to do.

31
02:51:53,051 --> 02:51:54,850
We shall not meet again...

32
02:51:54,850 --> 02:51:56,644
Elessar.
