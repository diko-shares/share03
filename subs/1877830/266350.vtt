3
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:12,571
- Last place of employment?
- Denver, Colorado.

4
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:17,196
I worked there for ten years...
but then things just dried up.

5
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:22,536
They lost 14 banks in one week.

6
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:32,367
There's nothing available for you,
right now.

7
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:47,319
They use their tongues to
deceive you. Venom is on their lips.

8
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:53,782
Their mouths are full
of bitterness and curses.

9
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:58,319
The fear of God
is not before their eyes.

10
00:03:58,536 --> 00:04:06,617
They have taken
the hearts and minds of our leaders.

11
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:09,943
They have blinded us to the truth.

12
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:16,239
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?

13
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:22,400
Outside the limit of our sight
they're feeding off us.

14
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:29,443
Perched on top of us
from birth to death, are our owners.

15
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:34,529
They have us. They control us.
They are our masters.

16
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:38,653
Wake up.
They're all around you.

17
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:10,859
<i>Sometimes when I watch TV</i>
<i>I stop being myself. I'm a star. </i>

18
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:16,941
<i>I have my own talk show. Or I'm</i>
<i>on the news getting out of a limo. </i>

19
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:22,311
<i>All I ever have to do is be famous. </i>
<i>People watch me. </i>

20
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:26,028
<i>And they love me. </i>

21
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,858
<i>I never grow old, and I never die. </i>

22
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,897
Excuse me,
do you need anybody?

23
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:59,441
- Maybe.
- I've got my own tools.

24
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:04,404
This is a union job.

25
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:17,142
May I please speak
with the shop steward, sir?

26
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:58,605
There's no sleeping on this site.
Sleep somewhere else tonight.

27
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,979
Excuse me, when do I get paid?

28
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:05,728
Thursday.

29
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:20,981
Do you need a place to stay?

30
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:27,899
There's a place over on 4th street.
They've got hot food and showers.

31
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,474
I don't like being followed
unless I know why.

32
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:06,473
I don't turn up with anybody
until I see where he's going.

33
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:32,558
They'll be serving food up soon.

34
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:50,676
This is Gilbert. Anything you need,
he knows where to find it.

35
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:55,137
- What's in the pack, tools?
- Yes, sir.

36
00:08:55,354 --> 00:09:01,136
If you can use them,
you can fix the shower over there.

37
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:04,684
Let's get something to eat.

38
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:27,341
- More?
- Yeah.

39
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:39,803
I've got a wife and two kids
back in Detroit.

40
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,260
I haven't seen them in six months.

41
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:50,556
The steel mills were laying people off.
They finally went under.

42
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:59,558
We gave the steel companies a break.
They gave themselves pay raises.

43
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:06,517
The golden rule: He who has the gold
makes the rules.

44
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:15,848
If they close one more factory, we
should take a sledge to their foreign cars.

45
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:21,130
- You should have more patience.
- I'm all out.

46
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:26,883
The whole deal
is some kind of crazy game.

47
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,840
The name of the game is:
Make it through life.

48
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:38,669
Only everyone is out for themselves
and looking to do you in.

49
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,598
You do what you can, but I'm going
to do my best to blow your ass away.

50
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:57,889
- So how are you going to make it?
- My chance will come.

51
00:10:58,099 --> 00:11:02,471
I believe in America.
I follow the rules.

52
00:11:03,557 --> 00:11:08,463
Everybody has got
their own hard times, these days.

53
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:36,919
<i>You thought press-on nails would</i>
<i>impede all the active things you do. </i>

54
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:42,589
<i>We've got beautiful, natural-looking, </i>
<i>easy-to-apply nails. </i>

55
00:11:42,805 --> 00:11:46,880
<i>There's seven different colors... </i>

56
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:51,303
<i>Our impulses are being redirected. </i>

57
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:57,010
<i>We live in an artificially-induced</i>
<i>state of consciousness. </i>

58
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,291
Goddamn hacker. That's the second
time tonight that asshole has cut in.

59
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:07,252
<i>The movement began eight months ago</i>
<i>by a group of scientists. </i>

60
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,625
<i>They accidentally discovered</i>
<i>these signals being sent... </i>

61
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:18,961
That thing's giving me a headache.

62
00:12:19,178 --> 00:12:22,957
It must have taken him months
to figure out how to do this.

63
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:29,707
<i>The under-class is growing. </i>
<i>Human rights are non-existent. </i>

64
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:37,795
<i>In their repressive society, we</i>
<i>are their unwitting accomplices. </i>

65
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:44,675
<i>Their intention to rule rests with</i>
<i>the annihilation of consciousness. </i>

66
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:51,839
<i>We have been lulled into a trance. </i>
<i>They have made us indifferent. </i>

67
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:57,585
<i>We are focused</i>
<i>only on our own gain... </i>

68
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,211
<i>They are safe</i>
<i>as long as they are not discovered. </i>

69
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:16,006
<i>That is their method of survival. </i>
<i>Keep us asleep. Keep us selfish. </i>

70
00:13:16,217 --> 00:13:21,834
<i>- Keep us sedated. </i>
- Blow it out of your ass.

71
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:53,742
- Choir practice was late last night.
- The church lets us use their kitchen.

72
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,208
- Till four in the morning?
- We care for a lot of people here.

73
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:16,870
<i>The sleeping middle-class</i>
<i>is suddenly becoming poor. </i>

74
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:23,247
<i>We are their cattle. </i>
<i>We are being bred for slavery. </i>

75
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:29,749
- Not again.
<i>- We cannot break their signal. </i>

76
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,493
<i>The signal must be shut off</i>
<i>at the source. </i>

77
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,743
- I have a headache.
- Me too, honey.

78
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:48,248
- What was that all about?
- That idiot's licking his nuts again.

79
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:25,326
THEY LIVE WE SLEEP

80
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,618
There's nothing wrong with it.

81
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,697
Only a few seconds got on the air.

82
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:53,734
Forget about breaking their signal.
They justjam us out again.

83
00:17:53,954 --> 00:18:00,564
- Put the shipment out on the street.
- It won't work. We've discussed this.

84
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,783
We have no other choice.

85
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:18,325
Robbing banks. Making our own lenses.
We just can't reach enough people.

86
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:30,110
We've got to find strong people
who'll work with us.

87
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:05,067
I'm just leaving. Your door was open.
I just thought I'd close it.

88
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:10,816
- Neighborhood watch.
- Let me touch your face.

89
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:14,279
Now your hands.

90
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,146
You're a working man.
The revolution...

91
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:24,945
- Let me show you.
- Maybe some other time.

92
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:31,234
This world may have blinded me,
but the Lord let me see.

93
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:34,730
You'll be back.

94
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:56,979
I've been hearing stuff on the street.
Weird stuff.

95
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,692
An epidemic of violence
is what they're saying.

96
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:04,601
I was talking
to one old boy from San Anselmo.

97
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:11,149
He says up there they're talking
end-of-the-world kind of stuff.

98
00:20:26,362 --> 00:20:30,735
- What are they doing?
- Shooting people, robbing banks.

99
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:37,984
A whole lot of people going crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

100
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:45,974
The truth is, this kind of shit
happens at the end of every century.

101
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:50,436
It's just people
afraid to face the future.

102
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,103
What's happening?

103
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:08,681
I was inside there. It's full of boxes
and some kind of lab setup.

104
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:13,190
- What do you mean?
- The singing is a tape recording.

105
00:21:15,735 --> 00:21:20,557
Leave it alone, man.
It's none of our business.

106
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:24,437
Gilbert is in there helping them.

107
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:34,851
I've got ajob now.
I just keep walking the white line.

108
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:40,684
I don't bother nobody. Nobody bothers
me. You should do the same.

109
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:53,977
The line in the middle of the road.
That's the worst place to drive.

110
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:02,102
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

111
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:53,726
Step down. Easy. This way.

112
00:22:58,187 --> 00:23:02,476
Now we cross the road.
It's dirt here.

113
00:23:42,644 --> 00:23:44,385
Go, go!

114
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:29,586
Frank!

115
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:21,509
Leave us alone.
We know you.

"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil. "

117
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:15,125
- Come and join the party.
- You go with them.

118
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,791

- Did you go to Mary Ellen's?
- She served tortillas! So dated!

- I'm so depressed. What do I do?
- Go for it, man.

Excuse me.

00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:59,971
You look like your head
fell in the cheese dip back in 1957.

You're okay.
This one, real fucking ugly.

154

I take these glasses off,
she looks like a regular person.

155
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:20,681
- I put them on, formaldehyde face.
- That's enough, or I call the cops.

156
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:25,299
The cops?
You need a Brazilian plastic surgeon.

157

I've got one that can see.

158
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:44,634
He's a tall, Caucasian male.
Unarmed, wearing sunglasses.

I don't like this one bit.

160
00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:51,717
Not one bit.

161
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,844
That's like pouring perfume on a pig.

Settle down.
Where did you get those glasses?

163
00:39:28,016 --> 00:39:31,926
- The tooth fairy.
- I'll bet.

00:39:34,016 --> 00:39:38,138
- We've got him.
- Cut yourself shaving?

165
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:42,591
You look as shitty to us
as we do to you.

166
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:48,173
- Impossible.
- Don't make us splatter your brains.

167
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:57,176
You stumbled onto something here,
but maybe we can all benefit from it.

168
00:39:59,013 --> 00:40:03,469
Let's go someplace quiet
so we can talk this over.

169
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:28,002
You bastards die just like we do.

170
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,250
I have come here to chew bubblegum
and kick ass.

171
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:27,839
And I'm all out of bubblegum.

172
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:48,917
Near the entrance. Has a shotgun.
White male. 30s. Long hair.

173
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:54,205
- Momma don't like tattletales.
- Wearing sunglasses.

174
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:23,788
And who are you?

175
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,661
Come to show them where I am.

176
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:42,296
Drop it.

177
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:46,126
Drop it.

178
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,212
Beat it.

179
00:43:31,837 --> 00:43:37,074
Take it easy.
We're just going on a little ride.

180
00:43:40,794 --> 00:43:43,791
Close the door.

181
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:53,450
Drive.

182
00:43:55,294 --> 00:43:58,161
Not too fast.

183
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:27,332
They're gone.

184
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:36,119
- Just keep driving.
- Where am I going?

185
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,698
- Are you married?
- Yes.

186
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:46,905
- Please, don't lie to me.
- No.

187
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:51,499
Live alone?

188
00:44:53,082 --> 00:44:56,945
- Your place.
- I'd rather not.

189
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:01,573
I'm afraid I must insist.

190
00:45:34,539 --> 00:45:36,659
Hi, Holly!

191
00:46:09,662 --> 00:46:15,776
- I don't know what you want.
- Just quiet.

192
00:46:17,453 --> 00:46:22,323
It's like a drug. Wearing
these glasses makes you high...

193
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:25,070
... but you come down hard.

194
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:31,400
- Things didn't turn out well today.
- You're not the only one.

195
00:46:32,536 --> 00:46:38,116
I'm sorry,
but I needed you to get away.

196
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:46,409
You have two guns.
You're not sorry, you're in charge.

197
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:56,112
We're in trouble. They're everywhere.
You can see them with these glasses.

198
00:46:56,327 --> 00:47:01,611
We're being controlled by these things
and we've got to stop them.

199
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:09,363
I'll do whatever you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

200
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:13,521
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

201
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:22,154
You're fighting the forces of evil...
that can only be seen with sunglasses.

202
00:47:25,033 --> 00:47:30,781
- Take a look.
- I'll wear your glasses, if you want.

203
00:47:30,992 --> 00:47:36,276
If I don't see what you see,
I'm going to see it anyway.

204
00:47:41,116 --> 00:47:49,019
- You have it your way.
- It's not my way... It's your way.

205
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:35,525
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm thirsty.

206
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:42,565
Go ahead.

207
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:09,067
I'm sorry I have to be here.

208
00:49:22,027 --> 00:49:27,856
- So your name's Holly?
- Holly Thompson.

209
00:49:30,443 --> 00:49:35,184
That's a pretty name.
What do you do?

210
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:42,102
Assistant program director. Cable 54.

211
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:48,847
A TV station? They're sending
signals out of TV sets.

212
00:50:03,151 --> 00:50:07,724
No, I'm all right.

213
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:21,850
Holly Thompson.
8634 Circle View Drive.

214
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,852
Yes, I'll hold.

215
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:47,433
Frank?

216
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:54,098
- Don't let anybody see you.
- I've had a rough couple of days.

217
00:52:54,308 --> 00:52:58,088
I want nothing to do with you.
How many people did you kill?

218
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:01,887
- They're not people.
- You crazy son-of-a-bitch.

219
00:53:02,101 --> 00:53:04,849
You ain't showing me nothing.

220
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:09,265
I've got a wife and kids.
Leave me alone.

221
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:14,179
Get out of here.

222
00:54:35,302 --> 00:54:37,756
No!

223
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:18,091
One week's pay.
It's the best I could do.

224
00:55:22,843 --> 00:55:25,330
Wait!

225
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:28,916
You'd better find someplace to hide.

226
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:32,416
- Try these on.
- You crazy mother!

227
00:55:32,634 --> 00:55:37,125
- Put these on.
- Stay away from me.

228
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:47,208
I'm trying to save you
and your family's life.

229
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:51,833
You can't even save yourself.

230
00:55:53,466 --> 00:56:00,754
I'm giving you a choice. Put these on
or start eating that trash can.

231
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:05,536
- Not this year.
- Okay.

232
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:12,704
Come on.

233
00:56:31,506 --> 00:56:36,293
I don't want to fight you.
Stop it.

234
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:44,249
Put on the glasses.

235
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:05,536
I told you
I didn't want to be involved.

236
00:57:13,879 --> 00:57:16,627
Dirty motherfucker.

237
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:35,418
Take a look. Put them on.

238
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,082
No!

239
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:23,788
I'm sorry.

240
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:44,284
Put the glasses on. Put them on!

241
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:09,904
Fuck you!

242
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,654
Look! They're everywhere.

243
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:12,149
They can see us.
They're at 5th and Spring.

244
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:19,283
Hold on. You aren't the first one
to wake up out of a dream.

245
01:01:19,492 --> 01:01:21,944
What's that?

246
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,728
Brother, life's a bitch...
and she's back in heat.

247
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:18,940
I want a room.

248
01:03:06,153 --> 01:03:09,601
Ain't love grand?

249
01:03:15,153 --> 01:03:18,066
CONFORM

250
01:03:30,278 --> 01:03:36,475
Don't wear those glasses too long.
It's like a knife in your skull.

251
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:46,436
- How long have they been there?
- Who knows?

252
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:51,307
- Where do they come from?
- They ain't from Cleveland.

253
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:56,063
I don't need that shit!
What are we going to do?

254
01:03:57,067 --> 01:04:01,937
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

255
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:07,979
When you get your master plan,
you let me know.

256
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:20,688
If we can see, we've got to find
the people who made these.

257
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:26,555
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

258
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:47,851
A long time ago,
things were different.

259
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:56,470
Daddy took me down to the river and
told me about the power and the glory.

260
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:59,438
I was saved.

261
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:07,267
He changed when I was little.
He turned mean.

262
01:05:09,064 --> 01:05:13,437
I ran away when I was 13.

263
01:05:14,688 --> 01:05:20,885
He tried to cut me once
with a big old razor.

264
01:05:21,105 --> 01:05:28,262
He held it up against my throat.
I said: "Daddy, please. "

265
01:05:28,478 --> 01:05:36,051
He kept moving back and forth,
like he was sawing down a tree.

266
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:46,227
Maybe they've always been with us,
those things out there.

267
01:05:46,437 --> 01:05:51,971
Maybe they love it,
seeing us hate each other.

268
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:57,601
Watching us kill each other off.
Feeding on our own cold hearts.

269
01:06:01,186 --> 01:06:04,183
I've got news for him.

270
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:08,258
There's going to be hell to pay.

271
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:13,679
I ain't Daddy's little boy no more.

272
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:40,172
Frank?

273
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:59,426
There's a meeting tonight at 11.
Watch out no one follows you.

274
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,048
The world needs a wake-up call.

275
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,714
We're going to phone it in.

276
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:30,094
Hey brothers...

277
01:07:31,807 --> 01:07:35,338
There's something new going down.

278
01:08:02,264 --> 01:08:09,136
They're using candyfloss packaging
to cover up a toxic waste dump.

279
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:27,129
Frank, glad you made it. Take your
glasses off. We're all human in here.

280
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:41,301
They're brand new.
We got the first shipment today.

281
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:46,256
They won't hurt.
There's less interference.

282
01:08:48,053 --> 01:08:50,801
Go ahead.

283
01:09:11,677 --> 01:09:14,959
- Any trouble getting here?
- No.

284
01:09:15,177 --> 01:09:19,418
The city is crawling with cops.
Most of them are human.

285
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:27,004
They've been told we're Commies.
Some of them have been recruited.

286
01:09:27,218 --> 01:09:31,128
- People are joining up with them?
- They sell out.

287
01:09:31,342 --> 01:09:38,168
Promotions, bank accounts,
new houses, cars.

288
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:43,798
Perfect, isn't it?
We'll do anything to be rich.

289
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:53,172
<i>Fluorocarbons have increased since</i>
<i>1958. Earth is being acclimatised. </i>

290
01:09:53,383 --> 01:09:57,756
<i>They are turning our atmosphere</i>
<i>into their atmosphere. </i>

291
01:09:57,966 --> 01:10:02,918
- What do these things want?
- They're free-enterprisers.

292
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:09,329
The earth is just another developing
planet. Their third world.

293
01:10:09,549 --> 01:10:13,589
<i>... deplete the planet, </i>
<i>move on to another. </i>

294
01:10:13,799 --> 01:10:21,038
<i>They want benign indifference. </i>
<i>We could be pets or food. </i>

295
01:10:21,256 --> 01:10:24,586
<i>But all we really are is livestock. </i>

296
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:32,826
We need an assault unit.
Someone to hit them hard.

297
01:10:33,048 --> 01:10:38,463
- You've got it.
- Ever seen their disappearing act?

298
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:41,505
Once.

299
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:45,873
- What's that?
- One of their watches.

300
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:51,290
Two-way radios.
You can listen to their broadcasts.

301
01:10:55,755 --> 01:11:01,372
They've got secret code.
They push a button...

302
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:07,667
All of a sudden they're gone.
I've been trying to figure it out.

303
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:14,159
Listen up. We're obviously
not getting to enough people.

304
01:11:14,378 --> 01:11:20,410
There should be twice as many people
here. We're getting too sloppy.

305
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:26,791
Their detection
is becoming more effective.

306
01:11:27,004 --> 01:11:33,331
Stay aware. Go to work.
Do what's expected of you.

307
01:11:33,545 --> 01:11:37,158
We've become reckless.
The movement is suffering.

308
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:44,866
Stop talking about it. It's time
we started spilling some blood.

309
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:51,911
Wait a minute! We don't stand a chance
with a few guns and grenades.

310
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:56,073
- What are we supposed to do?
- We bide our time.

311
01:11:56,293 --> 01:12:01,162
We locate their signal
and shut it off.

312
01:12:01,376 --> 01:12:08,498
Dave works at <i>K</i>RDA.
He may have located the signal.

313
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:11,576
<i>K</i>RDA is clear.

314
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:16,533
The transmission is going out clean.
The signal is from somewhere else.

315
01:12:22,876 --> 01:12:29,155
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal is coming from.

316
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:33,285
I've got to talk to someone.

317
01:12:46,082 --> 01:12:52,327
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

318
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:57,446
- I thought I'd killed you.
- I thought so, too.

319
01:13:00,666 --> 01:13:06,116
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

320
01:13:15,332 --> 01:13:18,579
I just want to...

321
01:13:19,414 --> 01:13:21,203
Can we... ?

322
01:13:26,622 --> 01:13:30,152
Get out!

323
01:15:18,784 --> 01:15:23,690
- They're killing everybody.
- I've got to find her.

324
01:15:24,534 --> 01:15:28,657
There's nothing you can do out there.

325
01:15:31,366 --> 01:15:35,655
If I can get this working,
I can listen in.

326
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:44,186
- Frank...
- What?

327
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:47,654
- Get set.
- Shit!

328
01:15:53,824 --> 01:15:56,655
- What was that?
- I don't know.

329
01:16:01,448 --> 01:16:07,729
Your wristwatch has malfunctioned.
This entryway will disappear...

330
01:16:07,947 --> 01:16:11,775
Move! Down there!

331
01:16:12,824 --> 01:16:15,904
Seven seconds.
Six seconds.

332
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:23,196
Two seconds.
One second.

333
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:30,068
If you need assistance
in finding your destination, -

334
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:35,351
- bilingual instructions
are posted in each corridor.

335
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:41,226
- What language is that?
- I don't know.

336
01:16:41,446 --> 01:16:45,521
- Where are we?
- I think we're under the city.

337
01:16:45,738 --> 01:16:49,730
Some kind of underground base.

338
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:55,774
- There's got to be a way out.
- I hope nobody saw us drop in.

339
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:09,690
Operation Steelfist is a success.
We have eliminated the terrorists.

340
01:17:10,612 --> 01:17:13,562
We got 'em!
We wiped 'em out!

341
01:17:13,778 --> 01:17:17,984
It's a win, man.
They got to meet the A-Team.

342
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:30,901
I'm hearing something.

343
01:17:47,818 --> 01:17:53,436
By the year 2025,
America and the entire planet -

344
01:17:53,652 --> 01:17:58,474
- will be under the protection
of this power alliance.

345
01:17:58,693 --> 01:18:05,897
The gains have been substantial for us
and for you, the human power-elite.

346
01:18:16,982 --> 01:18:22,516
You have given us the resources
we need for our expansion.

347
01:18:22,732 --> 01:18:26,891
In return, the per-capita income
of each of you has grown.

348
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:32,178
This year alone,
it's an average 39%.

349
01:18:40,898 --> 01:18:44,643
I've received word that our forces
have won a major victory.

350
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:50,888
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed.

351
01:18:51,107 --> 01:18:55,182
The situation is normal again.

352
01:18:57,148 --> 01:19:02,218
Hi boys, I didn't know
you'd been recruited.

353
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:07,261
You should have dressed
for the party now you can afford it.

354
01:19:09,688 --> 01:19:15,103
I'm proud to be here.
Have you seen the whole place?

355
01:19:15,313 --> 01:19:20,432
- I haven't had a chance to.
- I'll show you around.

356
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:29,095
I knew we had a lot in common
the first time we met.

357
01:19:36,645 --> 01:19:42,475
- Where the hell are we?
- Backstage of the show.

358
01:19:42,687 --> 01:19:49,642
This place serves its purpose.
Did you get here using one of these?

359
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:55,884
I know it's only for emergency,
but they're so much fun.

360
01:19:57,602 --> 01:20:03,302
You think that's something,
take a look at this.

361
01:20:03,519 --> 01:20:06,800
- Take a closer look.
<i>- Attention, commuters. </i>

362
01:20:07,019 --> 01:20:12,305
<i>Flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda</i>
<i>is now ready. </i>

363
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:16,050
That's where they come from.

364
01:20:36,559 --> 01:20:42,224
I don't know how it works.
It's a gravitational lens.

365
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:48,513
It puts a bend in the light and
you move from place to place.

366
01:20:48,724 --> 01:20:53,381
The whole thing
works like one big airport.

367
01:20:55,266 --> 01:21:02,009
They've got their act together,
believe you me.

368
01:21:12,599 --> 01:21:16,011
Evening, boys. Looking sharp.

369
01:21:16,224 --> 01:21:19,885
Wait till you see
what I'm going to show you now.

370
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:32,797
Here's the brains of the operation.

371
01:21:33,015 --> 01:21:37,505
The signal goes out through
the satellite all over the world.

372
01:21:37,722 --> 01:21:42,592
Pretty fancy.
I'm not too familiar with it.

373
01:21:59,223 --> 01:22:02,918
This is as far as we go.

374
01:22:08,347 --> 01:22:15,006
Can you get us inside? I've never
seen the inside of a TV studio.

375
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:21,335
- You look like the one to ask.
- I guess it wouldn't be a problem.

376
01:22:21,554 --> 01:22:25,677
Those boys over there
are friends of mine.

377
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:32,131
My buddies would like the grand tour.
Can we go inside?

378
01:22:32,345 --> 01:22:36,883
Be serious.
Do you have authorization cards?

379
01:22:37,095 --> 01:22:39,547
Right here.

380
01:22:42,137 --> 01:22:43,878
Watch the door.

381
01:22:47,887 --> 01:22:53,089
- Soundproof. Where's that signal?
- Up on the roof.

382
01:22:53,970 --> 01:23:01,790
- If Holly made it, she could help us.
- You're making a big mistake.

383
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,292
- We made the mistake?
- No, listen.

384
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:10,747
I thought you understood.
It's business, that's all it is.

385
01:23:10,968 --> 01:23:17,379
You still don't get it.
There ain't no countries anymore.

386
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:21,632
They're running the whole show.
They own the whole planet.

387
01:23:21,842 --> 01:23:26,499
They can do whatever they want.
We can have it good for a change.

388
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:31,706
If we help them, they'll leave us
alone to make some money.

389
01:23:31,926 --> 01:23:37,424
You can have a taste of the good life.
It's what everybody wants.

390
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:41,959
- You'd do it to your own kind?
- What's the threat?

391
01:23:42,176 --> 01:23:47,294
We all sell out every day,
might as well be on the winning team.

392
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:52,169
See you, boys.

393
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:55,086
Let's go.

394
01:23:57,507 --> 01:24:04,084
Was that the two minute break?
We must be running long.

395
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:18,376
What the hell is going on?

396
01:24:33,798 --> 01:24:35,954
Down!

397
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:50,502
- Now what?
- Find out where the hell we are.

398
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:58,251
Excuse me!
Do you know Holly Thompson?

399
01:24:58,462 --> 01:25:02,538
Holly Thompson.
Assistant program... something.

400
01:25:02,755 --> 01:25:08,287
Security alert. Sections Delta
and X-ray report to the fourth floor.

401
01:25:08,504 --> 01:25:10,957
Who's Holly?

402
01:25:12,837 --> 01:25:15,076
Shit!

403
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:23,875
I hate to interrupt. Could you
tell me how to get to the roof?

404
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:30,000
- How do I get to the roof?
- Turn left at the end of the hall.

405
01:25:43,877 --> 01:25:48,949
There's got to be more than one way
to get up there.

406
01:25:51,003 --> 01:25:55,494
Security 950. They're on the move.

407
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:42,283
- I hear them on the 19th floor.
- We're on the 21st. We've got them.

408
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:06,198
Holly!

409
01:27:24,915 --> 01:27:27,153
Come on!

410
01:27:27,539 --> 01:27:32,528
Security alert.
Intruders heading for the roof.

411
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:09,572
Frank! Are you and Holly clear?

412
01:28:09,786 --> 01:28:14,443
I'm clear, are you?

413
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,786
Don't do it.

414
01:28:25,328 --> 01:28:28,278
Don't interfere. You can't win.

415
01:28:37,994 --> 01:28:40,481
Drop your weapon.

416
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:46,733
Stand away from the dish
or we'll open fire.

417
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:53,481
- Come inside with me.
- You have ten seconds. Nine...

418
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:56,651
Eight. Seven.

419
01:28:58,035 --> 01:29:00,522
Six.

420
01:29:42,824 --> 01:29:46,734
<i>The Oscar winners</i>
<i>give a press conference... </i>

421
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:52,648
<i>- Gloria, you look like shit. </i>
<i>- What happened?</i>

422
01:29:53,114 --> 01:29:57,771
<i>All the sex and violence on the</i>
<i>screen has gone too far for me. </i>

423
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:04,899
<i>I'm fed up with it. Film makers</i>
<i>have to show some restraint... </i>

424
01:30:18,698 --> 01:30:20,734
<i>What's wrong, baby?</i>
