00:00:57,008 --> 00:01:01,468
<i>Between the time
when the oceans drank Atlantis...</i>

2
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,548
<i>... and the rise of the sons of Aryus...</i>

3
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:08,948
<i>... there was an age undreamed-of.</i>

4
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:11,678
<i>And unto this, Conan...</i>

5
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:16,019
<i>... destined to bear
the jeweled crown of Aquilonia...</i>

6
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:18,628
<i>... upon a troubled brow.</i>

7
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:23,892
<i>It is I, his chronicler,
who alone can tell thee of his saga.</i>

8
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,029
<i>Let me tell you of the days...</i>

9
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:30,105
<i>... of high adventure.</i>

10
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:16,033
Fire and wind come from the sky...

11
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:21,041
... from the gods of the sky,
but Crom is your god.

12
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:23,977
Crom lives in the earth.

13
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,178
Once giants lived in the earth, Conan.

14
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,488
And in the darkness of chaos...

15
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,559
... they fooled Crom and took
from him the enigma of steel.

16
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:40,389
Crom was angered
and the earth shook.

17
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:45,595
Fire and wind struck down the giants
and threw their bodies in the water.

18
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:50,804
But in their rage, the gods forgot
the secret of steel...

19
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:53,477
... and left it on the battlefield.

20
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,879
And we who found it...

21
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,112
... are just men.

22
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:03,484
Not gods. Not giants.

23
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:06,052
Just men.

24
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:11,193
The secret of steel has always
carried with it a mystery.

25
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:16,127
You must learn it, little Conan.
You must learn its discipline.

26
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:21,230
For no one,
no one in this world can you trust.

27
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,232
Not men, not women, not beasts.

28
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:30,906
This you can trust.

29
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,185
Kill that one!

30
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:05,219
You. Kill him!

31
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,724
<i>The ashes were trampled
into the earth...</i>

32
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,936
<i>... and the blood became as snow.</i>

33
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,764
<i>Who knows what they came for?</i>

34
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:45,737
<i>Weapons of steel or murder?</i>

35
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:51,139
<i>It was never known,
for their leader rode to the south...</i>

36
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,476
<i>... while children went north
with the Vanir.</i>

37
00:13:56,354 --> 00:14:01,951
<i>No one would ever know that my lord's
people had lived at all.</i>

38
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:07,689
<i>His was a tale of sorrow.</i>

39
00:17:38,676 --> 00:17:40,507
Sit here.

40
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:44,343
Sit here!

41
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:01,310
<i>He did not care anymore.</i>

42
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:04,347
<i>Life and death...</i>

43
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:07,119
<i>... the same.</i>

44
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:12,359
<i>Only that the crowd would
be there to greet him...</i>

45
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:16,294
<i>... with howls of lust and fury.</i>

46
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:21,334
<i>He began to realize
his sense of worth.</i>

47
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,137
<i>He mattered.</i>

48
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:03,044
<i>In time, his victories
could not easily be counted.</i>

49
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:05,908
<i>He was taken to the East...</i>

50
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:10,080
<i>... a great prize,
where the war masters...</i>

51
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:14,451
<i>... would teach him
the deepest secrets.</i>

52
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:41,751
<i>Language and writing
were made available...</i>

53
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:46,651
<i>... the poetry of Khitai,
the philosophy of Sung.</i>

54
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:58,663
<i>And he also came to know
the pleasures of women...</i>

55
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:03,668
<i>... when he was bred
to the finest stock.</i>

56
00:23:12,743 --> 00:23:18,306
<i>But always there remained the
discipline of steel.</i>

57
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,152
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

58
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,363
We won again!

59
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:40,536
This is good.

60
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:42,671
But what is best in life?

61
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,597
The open steppe.

62
00:23:45,242 --> 00:23:46,504
Fleet horse.

63
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:51,172
Falcons at your wrist.
And the wind in your hair.

64
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:56,216
Wrong!
Conan, what is best in life?

65
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:59,583
To crush your enemies, see them
driven before you...

66
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:02,725
... and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

67
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:05,559
That is good.

68
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,793
Go. Go. You're free.

69
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:53,098
Go.

70
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,304
<i>It has been surmised that perhaps
my lord was like a wild animal...</i>

71
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,915
<i>... that had been kept too long.</i>

72
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:04,519
<i>Perhaps.
But whatever, freedom...</i>

73
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:08,919
<i>... so long an
unremembered dream, was his.</i>

74
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,730
Crom.

75
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,812
There's warmth and fire.

76
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:46,860
Do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?

77
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,012
They said you would come.

78
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:46,748
From the north,
a man of great strength.

79
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,384
A conqueror.

80
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,826
A man who would someday be king
by his own hand.

81
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:01,330
Who would crush the snakes
of the earth...

82
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:04,165
Snakes? Did you say snakes?

83
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:11,971
What is it you seek?

84
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:14,011
A standard.

85
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,413
A symbol.

86
00:32:16,753 --> 00:32:18,744
Perhaps on a shield.

87
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,150
Two snakes, coming together.

88
00:32:23,827 --> 00:32:25,818
Facing each other...

89
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,329
... but they're one.

90
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:33,027
With a sun and a moon below.

91
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:37,034
Black sun, black moon.

92
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,275
Yes.

93
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:44,203
There's a price, barbarian.

94
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,118
Zamora.

95
00:32:55,625 --> 00:33:00,187
The crossroads of the world.

96
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:05,897
You will find...

97
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:09,970
... what you want...

98
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:14,803
... in Zamora!

99
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,044
Crom!

100
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:45,965
Food.

101
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:48,927
Food!

102
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,676
I have not eaten for days.

103
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,346
And who says you will?

104
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:09,081
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

105
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:13,055
Let me die not in hunger...

106
00:35:14,264 --> 00:35:15,731
... but in combat.

107
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:17,927
Who are you?

108
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:25,369
I am Subotai, thief and archer.

109
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:29,474
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

110
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,111
Why are you here?

111
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:35,577
Dinner for wolves.

112
00:35:40,456 --> 00:35:42,720
What gods do you pray to?

113
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,795
I pray to the Four Winds.

114
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,332
And you?

115
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,292
To Crom.

116
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:02,237
But I seldom pray to him.
He doesn't listen.

117
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:06,846
What good is he then?

118
00:36:07,684 --> 00:36:09,845
It's just as I've always said.

119
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,288
He's strong. If I die,
I have to go before him...

120
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:18,260
... and he will ask,
what's the rule of steel?

121
00:36:18,795 --> 00:36:21,628
If I don't know it,
he will cast me away.

122
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,925
That's Crom, strong on his mountain.

123
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,669
My god is greater.

124
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:33,369
Crom laughs from his mountain
at your Four Winds.

125
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,840
My god is stronger.

126
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,143
He is the everlasting sky.

127
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:43,277
Crom lives underneath him.

128
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:30,722
Civilization, ancient and wicked.
Have you ever seen this before?

129
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:34,068
No. Let's waste no time.

130
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:56,919
- It's good.
- We don't know how long it was there.

131
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:01,696
Stink!

132
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:06,629
Does it always smell?
How does the wind get in?

133
00:38:42,138 --> 00:38:44,129
How about two snakes...

134
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:49,340
... coming together over a black sun?
A magnificent standard.

135
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,413
The only ones I know are Set's
in those cursed towers.

136
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:55,675
They've spread to every city.

137
00:38:56,152 --> 00:39:00,088
Two years ago, it was a snake cult.
Now, everywhere.

138
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:04,756
They are deceivers.
They murder people in the night.

139
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,825
I know nothing.

140
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,938
Black lotus. Stygian. The best.

141
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,835
It better not be Haga.

142
00:39:20,043 --> 00:39:22,705
I would sell Haga to a slayer?

143
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:27,810
- A pittance to protect you from evil.
- I am evil.

144
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,178
They're all sluts.

145
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:34,189
He's dead already.

146
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:41,657
Can you believe that? Huh?

147
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:52,903
You're too big to be a thief.

148
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,809
Come. Let's leave this place.

149
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,423
Looking for snakes?
They live in the Tower of the Serpent.

150
00:40:11,694 --> 00:40:16,097
Said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...

151
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,425
... the Eye of the Serpent.

152
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:22,263
Chew it slowly. It's the good stuff.

153
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,871
- You are not a guard.
- Neither are you.

154
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,051
We're thieves like yourself.

155
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:15,781
- Come to climb the tower.
- You don't even have a rope.

156
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,327
Two fools who laugh at death.

157
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:24,590
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

158
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,131
No.

159
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:30,467
Then you go first.

160
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,852
- What could smell so bad?
- Do you want to live forever?

161
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:07,393
That one is the high priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

162
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:11,234
They say Thulsa Doom's
1000 years old.

163
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:18,346
I'll see what's here. Look below.

164
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:21,812
Kill them!

165
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,815
Do you want to live forever?

166
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:32,768
<i>All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.</i>

167
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,262
<i>Wealth can be wonderful.</i>

168
00:52:38,308 --> 00:52:42,677
<i>But you know, success can
test one's mettle...</i>

169
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:47,246
<i>... as surely as
the strongest adversary.</i>

170
00:53:11,374 --> 00:53:16,812
<i>They were taken to the hall
of King Osric, the Usurper.</i>

171
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:21,048
<i>Once a powerful Northman
like my lord...</i>

172
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:25,378
<i>... but now old and sotted.</i>

173
00:53:29,592 --> 00:53:32,390
These are the thieves
you requested.

174
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:34,620
I thought there were three.

175
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:39,097
Our companion died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.

176
00:53:39,836 --> 00:53:41,633
Lions ate him?

177
00:53:48,511 --> 00:53:51,412
The lions ate him!

178
00:54:01,357 --> 00:54:03,484
You know what you've done?

179
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:10,732
Rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king.

180
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,165
What daring! What outrageousness!
What insolence! What arrogance!

181
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,412
I salute you.

182
00:54:32,755 --> 00:54:38,193
Thulsa Doom. I've chafed for years
at this demi-god.

183
00:54:38,928 --> 00:54:41,920
Snakes in my beautiful city.

184
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:47,629
To the west, Nemedia, Aquilonia.
To the south, Koth, Stygia.

185
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:51,772
Snakes! Everywhere these evil towers.

186
00:54:51,974 --> 00:54:56,308
You alone have stood up to
their guards. And what are you?

187
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:57,944
Thieves!

188
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,448
You see this?

189
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:11,323
They call it the Fangs of the Serpent.

190
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:15,925
And this one was thrust
into a father's heart...

191
00:55:16,165 --> 00:55:18,224
... by his very son.

192
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:24,806
And my own daughter has fallen
under this Thulsa Doom's spell.

193
00:55:27,176 --> 00:55:31,977
Is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?

194
00:55:34,517 --> 00:55:36,610
She follows him as a slave...

195
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:40,418
... seeking for the truth of her soul...

196
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:43,158
... as if I couldn't give it to her.

197
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:55,365
As we speak,
my daughter travels east...

198
00:55:55,805 --> 00:55:59,707
... to Thulsa Doom and
his Mountain of Power.

199
00:56:00,877 --> 00:56:04,108
She is to be his!

200
00:56:12,688 --> 00:56:16,818
Steal my daughter back!
Take all you can carry.

201
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:26,666
There's more. There's much more.
Enough to become kings yourself.

202
00:56:31,507 --> 00:56:36,911
There comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle...

203
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,006
... when the gold loses its luster...

204
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:44,547
... when the throne room
becomes a prison...

205
00:56:46,189 --> 00:56:51,422
... and all that is left is
a father's love for his child.

206
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:01,102
To hell with Thulsa Doom.
He's evil.

207
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,362
A sorcerer who can summon demons.

208
00:57:05,107 --> 00:57:09,567
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

209
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,111
Thousands of them.

210
00:57:13,783 --> 00:57:18,117
This Mountain of Power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.

211
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:24,020
I have talked to Subotai
and he agrees.

212
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:27,093
Let's take what we have
while we live.

213
00:57:36,472 --> 00:57:39,635
I have never had so much as now.

214
00:57:41,043 --> 00:57:43,773
All my life I've been alone.

215
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:50,082
Many times I've faced my death
with no one to know.

216
00:57:52,755 --> 00:57:56,555
I would look into tents
of others in the dark...

217
00:57:56,792 --> 00:58:00,250
... and I would see figures
holding each other.

218
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:05,056
But I always passed by.

219
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:13,173
You and I, we have warmth.

220
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:16,510
That's so hard to find in this world.

221
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:23,612
Please. Let someone else pass by
in the night.

222
00:58:24,854 --> 00:58:29,689
Let's take the world by the throat,
and get what we desire.

223
01:00:52,835 --> 01:00:58,273
<i>The children of Doom.
Doom's children.</i>

224
01:00:58,507 --> 01:01:03,069
<i>They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.</i>

225
01:01:03,279 --> 01:01:08,683
<i>They told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.</i>

226
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:16,079
<i>Time enough for the earth
in the grave.</i>

227
01:02:25,427 --> 01:02:31,161
<i>Once, great men lived here.
Giants, gods.</i>

228
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,062
<i>Once, but long ago.</i>

229
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:44,168
<i>It was here that I met my master.</i>

230
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:46,937
<i>It was no accident.</i>

231
01:02:47,216 --> 01:02:52,586
<i>Nor is it mere chance that
I am the teller of his tale.</i>

232
01:02:55,624 --> 01:02:56,556
Hey!

233
01:02:59,895 --> 01:03:02,227
I'm a wizard, mind you.

234
01:03:02,698 --> 01:03:08,068
This place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.

235
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:12,405
Harm my flesh and you will have
to kill the dead.

236
01:03:13,242 --> 01:03:15,210
Can you summon demons?

237
01:03:15,644 --> 01:03:18,943
Yes! I strike at you!

238
01:03:19,214 --> 01:03:22,775
I summon demons more ferocious
than all in hell!

239
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:44,770
Mounds have been here since the time
of the Titans.

240
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:49,077
Kings buried in them, great kings.

241
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:54,147
Domains once glittered like
the light on the windy sea.

242
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:59,354
Fire won't burn there. No fire at all.

243
01:03:59,622 --> 01:04:02,682
That's why I live down here
in the wind.

244
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:05,827
You care for these places?

245
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:10,465
I sing to them,
on nights when they wish.

246
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:14,466
I sing of the tales
of battles, heroes...

247
01:04:14,703 --> 01:04:16,170
... witches and women.

248
01:04:16,872 --> 01:04:19,102
Nobody bothers me down here.

249
01:04:19,308 --> 01:04:22,607
Not even Thulsa Doom.

250
01:04:26,682 --> 01:04:28,445
Do flowers grow here?

251
01:04:29,485 --> 01:04:31,077
Flowers?

252
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:41,458
Flowers.

253
01:04:42,698 --> 01:04:45,667
You're not a pilgrim, are you?

254
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,994
Oil the sword and feed the horse.

255
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:52,502
Have you ever ridden
one of those before?

256
01:04:54,176 --> 01:04:55,609
No!

257
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,646
Warrior, what are the flowers for?

258
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:04,614
For a girl.

259
01:07:03,005 --> 01:07:07,442
- Where are you going, brother?
- I'm afraid.

260
01:07:07,643 --> 01:07:11,841
Afraid to bare yourself? Why?

261
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:17,441
You're so big and well-grown.
You should be proud of your body.

262
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:22,650
How can you reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?

263
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:28,528
Could we talk over there
where the others cannot see?

264
01:07:29,097 --> 01:07:33,500
Why, yes, brother. Of course.

265
01:07:46,615 --> 01:07:49,607
I'm afraid and I'm shy.

266
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:56,953
Is this your robe, your priest's robe?

267
01:07:57,159 --> 01:07:59,559
Yes, it's all I have.

268
01:08:00,529 --> 01:08:02,121
Good.

269
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,128
That's all you'll ever need.
