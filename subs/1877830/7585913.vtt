00:01:28.865 --> 00:01:29.866
Hey!

2
00:01:56.976 --> 00:01:59.562
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

3
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.569
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

4
00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:08.196
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

5
00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:10.615
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

6
00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:14.535
<i>And 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Re√°l in a dead heat.</i>

7
00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:16.120
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

8
00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:19.666
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

9
00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.795
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

10
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.630
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

11
00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:28.466
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

12
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.069
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

13
00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:34.264
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

14
00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:37.141
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

15
00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:38.661
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

16
00:02:38.685 --> 00:02:39.602
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

17
00:02:39.686 --> 00:02:41.938
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

18
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:43.064
<i>Under my administration,</i>

19
00:02:43.147 --> 00:02:46.943
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

20
00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:50.530
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

21
00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:52.907
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

22
00:02:52.991 --> 00:02:53.991
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

23
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:55.386
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

24
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.428
<i>But listen...</i>

25
00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:57.930
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

26
00:02:57.954 --> 00:02:59.414
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

27
00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:04.919
Hey.

28
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.090
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

29
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.972
Why is she still tied?

30
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.563
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

31
00:03:30.653 --> 00:03:33.072
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

32
00:03:33.156 --> 00:03:35.033
Just call me in the morning, okay?

33
00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:40.723
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

34
00:03:40.747 --> 00:03:43.291
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

35
00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.044
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

36
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.833
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

37
00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:23.432
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

38
00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:28.270
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

39
00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:35.235
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

40
00:05:36.153 --> 00:05:38.238
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

41
00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.241
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

42
00:05:42.284 --> 00:05:43.994
<i>Watching.</i>

43
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:50.000
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

44
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.175
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

45
00:06:11.813 --> 00:06:13.791
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

46
00:06:13.815 --> 00:06:16.443
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

47
00:06:16.526 --> 00:06:18.028
<i>It's a big city.</i>

48
00:06:22.658 --> 00:06:24.368
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

49
00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:36.880
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

50
00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:43.804
Look at this guy, man.

51
00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.142
Boom!

52
00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:51.311
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

53
00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:56.960
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

54
00:06:56.984 --> 00:06:58.584
Yo, let's see your hits.

55
00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:00.612
That's you.

56
00:07:21.091 --> 00:07:25.012
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

57
00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:28.974
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

58
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.852
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

59
00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:34.980
<i>It's a warning.</i>

60
00:07:36.773 --> 00:07:37.774
<i>To them.</i>

61
00:07:47.492 --> 00:07:48.702
<i>Fear...</i>

62
00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:53.832
<i>Is a tool.</i>

63
00:08:04.927 --> 00:08:08.096
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drop head!

64
00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:22.486
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

65
00:08:25.447 --> 00:08:26.448
Come on!

66
00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:36.791
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

67
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.720
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

68
00:08:58.521 --> 00:08:59.665
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

69
00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.148
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

70
00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.359
Help!

71
00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.652
Somebody help me!

72
00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.446
Help, help!

73
00:09:14.328 --> 00:09:15.722
Where you goin', huh?

74
00:09:20.334 --> 00:09:21.334
Come on.

75
00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:23.045
Come on, man. Break it.

76
00:09:25.214 --> 00:09:26.632
You can't move, huh?

77
00:09:27.008 --> 00:09:28.718
Now knock his ass out.

78
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.511
Showtime. Showtime, man.

79
00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:32.138
Come on, man.

80
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:33.472
Come on. Do it, man.

81
00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:10.426
You see this guy?

82
00:10:17.642 --> 00:10:19.268
The hell are you supposed to be?

83
00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:37.578
I'm vengeance.

84
00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:40.623
Holy shit. It's him.

85
00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:07.441
Hey, man. No, no, no!

86
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:50.568
Please don't hurt me.

87
00:12:26.604 --> 00:12:28.189
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

88
00:12:29.565 --> 00:12:30.983
Police action.

89
00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:33.236
He's with me, Officer.

90
00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.073
Are you kidding me, sir?

91
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.742
You're gonna let him in here?

92
00:12:40.409 --> 00:12:43.204
Martinez, let him through.

93
00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.594
Goddamn freak.

94
00:13:14.484 --> 00:13:15.569
What do we know?

95
00:13:26.413 --> 00:13:27.789
Detective?

96
00:13:27.872 --> 00:13:29.499
Sorry, Lieutenant.

97
00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:34.880
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

98
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.800
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

99
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.597
All this blood is from his head?

100
00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:45.056
No.

101
00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:50.604
Excuse me.

102
00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.774
Most of it's from his hand.

103
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:01.281
Thumb was severed.

104
00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.118
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

105
00:14:05.493 --> 00:14:07.412
He was alive when it was cut off.

106
00:14:08.705 --> 00:14:10.123
Ecchymosis...

107
00:14:11.374 --> 00:14:12.918
around the wound.

108
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:29.851
Security detail downstairs

109
00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:32.145
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

110
00:14:33.647 --> 00:14:35.857
The mayor was up here alone.

111
00:14:38.276 --> 00:14:40.987
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

112
00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:49.162
You said there was a card.

113
00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:50.830
Yeah.

114
00:15:00.966 --> 00:15:04.010
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

115
00:15:05.303 --> 00:15:07.013
Haven't a clue?

116
00:15:07.097 --> 00:15:09.474
Let's play a game, just me and you.

117
00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:13.061
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

118
00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:16.481
There's a cipher too.

119
00:15:23.238 --> 00:15:25.115
Any of this mean anything to you?

120
00:15:27.659 --> 00:15:28.868
What's going on here?

121
00:15:31.955 --> 00:15:33.373
I asked him to come, Pete.

122
00:15:33.456 --> 00:15:35.125
This is a crime scene.

123
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:37.544
It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!

124
00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:39.629
I got the press downstairs.

125
00:15:39.713 --> 00:15:42.465
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

126
00:15:42.549 --> 00:15:44.384
But this is way over the line.

127
00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:49.139
Wait.

128
00:15:49.222 --> 00:15:50.992
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

129
00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:52.142
How do you know?

130
00:15:52.225 --> 00:15:55.228
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

131
00:15:55.312 --> 00:15:57.123
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

132
00:15:57.147 --> 00:15:58.833
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

133
00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.400
He lies still.

134
00:16:01.902 --> 00:16:02.903
Excuse me?

135
00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:05.530
The riddle.

136
00:16:06.114 --> 00:16:09.534
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

137
00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:20.170
Oh, Jesus.

138
00:16:23.423 --> 00:16:26.218
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

139
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.054
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

140
00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:31.473
Excuse me, Commissioner.

141
00:16:32.557 --> 00:16:34.226
They're ready for your statement.

142
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.981
I want him outta here.

143
00:16:40.607 --> 00:16:41.691
Now!

144
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:49.491
Come on.

145
00:17:02.295 --> 00:17:03.505
Yeah.

146
00:17:04.756 --> 00:17:06.174
The kid found him.

147
00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:14.182
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

148
00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:32.784
We really gotta go, man.

149
00:17:38.373 --> 00:17:42.085
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

150
00:17:42.544 --> 00:17:44.379
A wife lost a husband.

151
00:17:45.589 --> 00:17:47.132
And I lost a friend.

152
00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:50.759
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

153
00:17:50.843 --> 00:17:53.929
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

154
00:17:54.388 --> 00:17:56.557
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

155
00:17:57.308 --> 00:18:00.728
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

156
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:04.899
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

157
00:18:04.982 --> 00:18:06.233
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

158
00:18:06.317 --> 00:18:09.153
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

159
00:18:09.236 --> 00:18:10.821
<i>but I don't know.</i>

160
00:18:16.744 --> 00:18:19.622
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

161
00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:21.790
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

162
00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:23.876
<i>And now this.</i>

163
00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:27.630
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

164
00:18:30.341 --> 00:18:31.592
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

165
00:18:33.677 --> 00:18:35.971
<i>But I have to try.</i>

166
00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:38.015
<i>Push myself.</i>

167
00:19:24.103 --> 00:19:26.605
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

168
00:19:27.565 --> 00:19:29.483
<i>behind the mask.</i>

169
00:19:33.988 --> 00:19:36.282
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

170
00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:40.244
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

171
00:19:42.621 --> 00:19:44.206
<i>everything that happened.</i>

172
00:19:58.762 --> 00:20:00.407
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

173
00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:04.310
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

174
00:20:04.393 --> 00:20:07.229
<i>Was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

175
00:20:07.313 --> 00:20:09.064
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

176
00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:10.816
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

177
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.401
<i>still have not been released,</i>

178
00:20:12.484 --> 00:20:15.362
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

179
00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:18.699
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

180
00:20:18.824 --> 00:20:20.618
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

181
00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:23.245
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

182
00:20:23.329 --> 00:20:27.583
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

183
00:20:27.666 --> 00:20:29.418
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

184
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:31.462
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

185
00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:34.381
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

186
00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:38.302
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

187
00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:40.179
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

188
00:20:40.262 --> 00:20:42.932
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

189
00:20:43.015 --> 00:20:46.268
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

190
00:20:46.352 --> 00:20:50.314
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

191
00:20:50.397 --> 00:20:54.568
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

192
00:20:54.652 --> 00:20:56.070
I assume you heard about this.

193
00:20:57.947 --> 00:20:59.227
Yeah.

194
00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:07.539
Oh, I see.

195
00:21:08.374 --> 00:21:10.334
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

196
00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:12.044
Dear God.

197
00:21:20.803 --> 00:21:22.846
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

198
00:21:30.854 --> 00:21:33.148
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

199
00:21:36.318 --> 00:21:38.112
The killer left this for the Batman?

200
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.198
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

201
00:21:41.282 --> 00:21:42.283
Apparently.

202
00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:44.451
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

203
00:21:46.495 --> 00:21:47.830
Why is he writing to you?

204
00:21:47.913 --> 00:21:49.391
<i>It's Mitchell, for Christ sakes!</i>

205
00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:50.457
I don't know yet.

206
00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:52.084
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

207
00:21:53.961 --> 00:21:55.379
Have a shower.

208
00:21:56.839 --> 00:21:58.519
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

209
00:21:58.591 --> 00:21:59.508
are coming for breakfast.

210
00:21:59.592 --> 00:22:01.594
Here? Why?

211
00:22:01.677 --> 00:22:02.821
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

212
00:22:02.845 --> 00:22:03.965
I haven't got time for this.

213
00:22:04.013 --> 00:22:05.681
It's getting serious, Bruce.

214
00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:08.851
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

215
00:22:08.934 --> 00:22:10.519
I don't care about that.

216
00:22:11.437 --> 00:22:12.313
Any of that.

217
00:22:12.396 --> 00:22:14.036
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

218
00:22:16.275 --> 00:22:19.403
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

219
00:22:19.486 --> 00:22:21.655
If I can't change things here,

220
00:22:22.197 --> 00:22:24.116
if I can't have an effect,

221
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.827
then I don't care what happens to me.

222
00:22:26.911 --> 00:22:28.037
That's what I'm afraid of.

223
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.746
Alfred, stop.

224
00:22:31.122 --> 00:22:32.582
You're not my father.

225
00:22:35.376 --> 00:22:36.794
I'm well aware.

226
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.373
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

227
00:23:39.023 --> 00:23:40.608
Some fresh berries there.

228
00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:48.908
What are you doing?

229
00:23:49.284 --> 00:23:52.954
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

230
00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:57.250
This is actually quite elusive.

231
00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:01.921
Where'd you get those O's?

232
00:24:03.464 --> 00:24:06.259
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

233
00:24:06.342 --> 00:24:08.761
It only gives us H, E, I, I, S, and T.

234
00:24:08.845 --> 00:24:12.891
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

235
00:24:12.974 --> 00:24:14.350
see where it leads.

236
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:17.270
That's interesting.

237
00:24:18.521 --> 00:24:19.647
Mr. Pennyworth?

238
00:24:20.023 --> 00:24:21.024
Yes, Dory?

239
00:24:21.357 --> 00:24:22.817
The accountants are here.

240
00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:24.736
See them in, please, Dory.

241
00:24:27.655 --> 00:24:29.866
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

242
00:24:29.949 --> 00:24:31.534
What do you mean?

243
00:24:31.618 --> 00:24:33.453
What if this is the whole key?

244
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.915
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

245
00:24:36.998 --> 00:24:39.101
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

246
00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:40.293
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

247
00:24:40.376 --> 00:24:42.503
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

248
00:24:42.587 --> 00:24:44.422
I don't see how that's gonna...

249
00:24:46.966 --> 00:24:47.967
Oh.

250
00:25:01.773 --> 00:25:03.441
Damn.

251
00:25:03.608 --> 00:25:05.860
Yeah, he's got a car.

252
00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:09.155
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

253
00:25:09.239 --> 00:25:10.907
Where to even start?

254
00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:13.826
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

255
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.030
You don't trust me?

256
00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:17.538
You mean like you trust me?

257
00:25:17.622 --> 00:25:20.500
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

258
00:25:22.502 --> 00:25:23.628
There.

259
00:25:46.734 --> 00:25:48.027
What are we looking for?

260
00:25:48.653 --> 00:25:50.196
A USB port.

261
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.406
USB?

262
00:25:58.496 --> 00:25:59.664
What?

263
00:26:05.044 --> 00:26:07.297
"Thumb" drive.

264
00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:09.716
Jesus.

265
00:26:13.344 --> 00:26:14.846
It's encrypted.

266
00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:19.559
Try this.

267
00:26:26.566 --> 00:26:28.943
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

268
00:26:37.827 --> 00:26:40.413
Oh, well, well, well.

269
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.082
So much for family values.

270
00:26:43.249 --> 00:26:44.417
Who is she?

271
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.085
No idea.

272
00:26:47.003 --> 00:26:49.839
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

273
00:26:50.173 --> 00:26:51.973
I know who he is.

274
00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:53.134
What was that?

275
00:26:54.886 --> 00:26:57.722
Shit, shit! The drive.

276
00:26:58.473 --> 00:27:00.808
It sent out the photos from my account.

277
00:27:00.892 --> 00:27:03.436
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

278
00:27:03.519 --> 00:27:05.605
Jesus.

279
00:27:05.688 --> 00:27:08.066
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

280
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:09.609
"He lies still."

281
00:27:09.817 --> 00:27:10.859
About her?

282
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.695
Maybe.

283
00:27:13.862 --> 00:27:15.739
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

284
00:27:15.822 --> 00:27:19.243
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

285
00:27:19.326 --> 00:27:21.453
Never get in there without a warrant.

286
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:24.873
Yeah.

287
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:39.179
Know who I am?

288
00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:42.766
Yeah. I got an idea.

289
00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:44.643
I want to see the Penguin.

290
00:27:45.352 --> 00:27:47.604
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

291
00:27:52.985 --> 00:27:53.986
What's the problem?

292
00:27:54.069 --> 00:27:55.487
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

293
00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:57.739
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

294
00:27:57.823 --> 00:27:59.449
That's what I tried to tell him.

295
00:27:59.533 --> 00:28:01.827
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

296
00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.870
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

297
00:28:05.163 --> 00:28:06.248
Mine or yours?

298
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.590
Get him!

299
00:28:15.632 --> 00:28:16.860
I saw that whole thing.

300
00:28:16.884 --> 00:28:18.093
He's over there!

301
00:28:18.176 --> 00:28:19.511
What is your problem?

302
00:29:02.179 --> 00:29:04.348
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

303
00:29:14.942 --> 00:29:16.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

304
00:29:16.485 --> 00:29:18.612
Take it easy, sweetheart.

305
00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:20.489
You looking for me?

306
00:29:21.198 --> 00:29:23.116
I see you met the twins.

307
00:29:24.076 --> 00:29:27.371
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

308
00:29:28.247 --> 00:29:29.748
I guess we both are.

309
00:29:31.792 --> 00:29:33.210
How you doing?

310
00:29:33.835 --> 00:29:35.254
I'm Oz.

311
00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:42.052
Who is she?

312
00:29:45.097 --> 00:29:47.015
I really don't know, chief.

313
00:29:47.724 --> 00:29:49.935
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

314
00:29:50.018 --> 00:29:51.395
but I wasn't rolling with them.

315
00:30:04.825 --> 00:30:05.826
It's okay, baby.

316
00:30:06.368 --> 00:30:10.163
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

317
00:30:35.898 --> 00:30:37.107
Thank you, honey.

318
00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:45.449
Here you go, champ.

319
00:30:45.532 --> 00:30:49.077
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

320
00:30:49.161 --> 00:30:50.954
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

321
00:30:51.455 --> 00:30:52.831
Is that the mayor?

322
00:30:52.915 --> 00:30:54.708
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

323
00:30:55.918 --> 00:30:57.211
Don't make me hurt you.

324
00:30:57.294 --> 00:31:01.465
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

325
00:31:01.548 --> 00:31:04.509
Yeah, I do. Do you?

326
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:07.763
Look...

327
00:31:09.014 --> 00:31:11.808
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

328
00:31:12.643 --> 00:31:16.939
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

329
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:26.865
Tell you one thing.

330
00:31:29.034 --> 00:31:32.621
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

331
00:31:33.121 --> 00:31:35.624
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

332
00:31:38.877 --> 00:31:40.712
What? Too soon?

333
00:31:50.555 --> 00:31:52.932
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

334
00:32:02.233 --> 00:32:03.234
Taxi!

335
00:32:05.736 --> 00:32:06.737
Taxi!

336
00:32:25.506 --> 00:32:26.799
Hey, it's me.

337
00:32:28.092 --> 00:32:29.427
Baby, what's wrong?

338
00:32:30.094 --> 00:32:32.096
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

339
00:32:34.557 --> 00:32:35.975
On the news?

340
00:32:36.642 --> 00:32:39.937
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

341
00:32:40.021 --> 00:32:41.731
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

342
00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:46.527
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

343
00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:49.864
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

344
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:52.221
Uh...

345
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.494
God damn it.

346
00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:17.534
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

347
00:33:17.558 --> 00:33:19.435
<i>With a younger mystery woman.</i>

348
00:33:19.518 --> 00:33:22.355
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>

349
00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:58.724
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

350
00:36:13.234 --> 00:36:14.674
You're pretty good at that.

351
00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:48.310
Hey! Give me that.

352
00:36:51.938 --> 00:36:54.482
"Kosolov, Annika."

353
00:36:55.984 --> 00:36:58.069
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

354
00:36:58.153 --> 00:37:00.906
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

355
00:37:38.985 --> 00:37:41.613
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

356
00:37:41.696 --> 00:37:44.157
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

357
00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:45.676
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

358
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.452
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

359
00:37:47.535 --> 00:37:48.912
What does she know?

360
00:37:48.995 --> 00:37:51.182
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

361
00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.791
She did seem upset.

362
00:37:54.584 --> 00:37:56.086
Back at your place.

363
00:37:58.129 --> 00:37:59.631
Let's go talk to her.

364
00:38:25.824 --> 00:38:26.908
Anni!

365
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:29.286
Baby!

366
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:31.955
Anni!

367
00:38:36.001 --> 00:38:37.252
Anni!

368
00:38:39.713 --> 00:38:41.148
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

369
00:38:41.172 --> 00:38:43.383
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

370
00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.403
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

371
00:38:45.427 --> 00:38:50.807
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>

372
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:53.244
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>

373
00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:56.104
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

374
00:38:57.981 --> 00:38:59.733
Shit, they took my phone.

375
00:38:59.816 --> 00:39:01.252
<i>His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,</i>

376
00:39:01.276 --> 00:39:02.694
<i>Commissioner Pete Savage,</i>

377
00:39:02.777 --> 00:39:04.905
<i>was found dead earlier tonight</i>

378
00:39:04.988 --> 00:39:08.199
<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>

379
00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:11.620
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>

380
00:39:11.703 --> 00:39:14.581
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>

381
00:39:19.669 --> 00:39:22.380
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

382
00:39:22.464 --> 00:39:24.424
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

383
00:39:25.926 --> 00:39:27.552
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

384
00:39:27.636 --> 00:39:32.432
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>

385
00:39:32.515 --> 00:39:34.559
<i>But I am not done.</i>

386
00:39:37.729 --> 00:39:39.898
<i>Here is another...</i>

387
00:39:44.402 --> 00:39:47.197
<i>Who will soon be losing face.</i>

388
00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:52.744
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

389
00:39:52.827 --> 00:39:54.663
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

390
00:39:54.746 --> 00:39:59.751
<i>when the truth about our city</i>
<i>will finally...</i>

391
00:40:00.544 --> 00:40:02.546
<i>be unmasked.</i>

392
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.882
<i>Goodbye!</i>

393
00:40:10.136 --> 00:40:11.822
<i>Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished</i>

394
00:40:11.846 --> 00:40:13.974
<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

395
00:40:14.057 --> 00:40:16.268
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

396
00:40:17.644 --> 00:40:18.645
At the club.

397
00:40:20.313 --> 00:40:21.731
The Iceberg Lounge?

398
00:40:22.482 --> 00:40:23.942
44 Below.

399
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.861
What is that?

400
00:40:30.115 --> 00:40:31.658
The club within the club.

401
00:40:32.742 --> 00:40:34.661
The real club.

402
00:40:36.955 --> 00:40:38.707
It's a mob hangout.

403
00:40:39.165 --> 00:40:40.584
Is that where you work?

404
00:40:42.502 --> 00:40:43.502
Selina?

405
00:40:49.217 --> 00:40:51.094
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

406
00:40:54.556 --> 00:40:56.099
But I see 'em come in.

407
00:40:56.182 --> 00:40:57.392
Who?

408
00:40:57.976 --> 00:41:00.395
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

409
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:04.649
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

410
00:41:06.902 --> 00:41:08.445
You're gonna help me on this.

411
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.571
For your friend.

412
00:41:21.165 --> 00:41:22.499
You got a lot of cats.

413
00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:25.920
I have a thing about strays.

414
00:41:30.049 --> 00:41:31.383
You're not safe here.

415
00:41:32.509 --> 00:41:33.677
I can take care of myself.

416
00:41:33.761 --> 00:41:36.555
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

417
00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:38.182
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

418
00:41:38.265 --> 00:41:41.518
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

419
00:41:41.602 --> 00:41:44.438
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

420
00:42:02.456 --> 00:42:05.626
He waited for him at the gym.

421
00:42:06.752 --> 00:42:08.796
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

422
00:42:08.879 --> 00:42:11.006
when no one else was around.

423
00:42:12.132 --> 00:42:13.551
There's a needle mark on his neck.

424
00:42:13.634 --> 00:42:15.594
Injected him with arsenic.

425
00:42:17.596 --> 00:42:18.931
Rat poison.

426
00:42:19.723 --> 00:42:21.308
Yeah.

427
00:42:21.475 --> 00:42:23.936
That seems to be his theme here.

428
00:42:24.478 --> 00:42:25.854
Look at this thing.

429
00:42:33.988 --> 00:42:35.739
It's a maze.

430
00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:41.620
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

431
00:42:44.373 --> 00:42:45.457
More symbols.

432
00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.545
It's another cipher.

433
00:42:49.628 --> 00:42:52.381
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

434
00:42:53.048 --> 00:42:55.634
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

435
00:42:55.718 --> 00:42:58.846
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

436
00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:01.765
I don't get it.

437
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:04.226
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

438
00:43:05.144 --> 00:43:07.146
Looks like he got greedy.

439
00:43:07.229 --> 00:43:08.272
You kidding me?

440
00:43:08.355 --> 00:43:11.066
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

441
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.403
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

442
00:43:14.486 --> 00:43:16.697
Maybe he's not who you thought.

443
00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.284
You make it sound like he had it coming.

444
00:43:22.536 --> 00:43:23.996
He was a cop.

445
00:43:25.331 --> 00:43:26.624
Crossed a line.

446
00:43:57.863 --> 00:43:59.531
"I'm mad about you.

447
00:43:59.615 --> 00:44:03.285
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

448
00:44:10.417 --> 00:44:13.504
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

449
00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:17.258
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

450
00:44:17.341 --> 00:44:19.051
The hell is that?

451
00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:22.972
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

452
00:44:24.098 --> 00:44:25.599
I don't know.

453
00:44:26.475 --> 00:44:27.643
Lieutenant.

454
00:44:27.726 --> 00:44:29.144
They're coming back.

455
00:44:29.228 --> 00:44:30.628
We got to get out of here.

456
00:44:34.567 --> 00:44:35.776
Come on.

457
00:44:40.864 --> 00:44:41.907
Ow!

458
00:44:43.367 --> 00:44:44.702
I don't know about these things.

459
00:44:44.785 --> 00:44:48.247
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

460
00:44:52.251 --> 00:44:54.837
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

461
00:44:56.714 --> 00:44:58.173
I'm just looking for Annika.

462
00:45:02.469 --> 00:45:04.096
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

463
00:45:05.222 --> 00:45:07.850
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

464
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:18.611
Look at me.

465
00:45:28.245 --> 00:45:30.414
Looks good. Here.

466
00:46:13.581 --> 00:46:15.583
I got you. Can you hear me?

467
00:46:16.543 --> 00:46:17.544
Yeah.

468
00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:27.220
Hey, where you goin'?

469
00:46:27.845 --> 00:46:28.972
Hospitality.

470
00:46:29.722 --> 00:46:32.559
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

471
00:46:34.352 --> 00:46:35.853
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

472
00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:44.612
"Kenzie, William."

473
00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:46.155
He's an off-duty cop.

474
00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:50.010
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

475
00:46:50.034 --> 00:46:52.078
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

476
00:47:08.636 --> 00:47:11.764
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

477
00:47:11.848 --> 00:47:12.974
Great.

478
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:22.585
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

479
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:24.193
Feels good, doesn't it?

480
00:47:24.277 --> 00:47:26.487
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

481
00:47:32.535 --> 00:47:34.162
<i>Jesus, I hate drop heads.</i>

482
00:47:34.245 --> 00:47:35.288
Really?

483
00:47:35.371 --> 00:47:36.390
'Cause when I first saw you,

484
00:47:36.414 --> 00:47:37.683
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

485
00:47:37.707 --> 00:47:39.959
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

486
00:47:40.585 --> 00:47:42.337
Can we not do this right now?

487
00:47:44.255 --> 00:47:45.798
Wait. Who was that?

488
00:47:45.882 --> 00:47:47.050
Oh, I saw him.

489
00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:48.218
<i>Look back.</i>

490
00:47:48.301 --> 00:47:50.154
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

491
00:47:50.178 --> 00:47:51.512
I need to see his face.

492
00:47:53.181 --> 00:47:54.641
Jesus.

493
00:48:02.649 --> 00:48:03.816
That's the DA.

494
00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.943
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

495
00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:06.694
And he's coming over. You happy?

496
00:48:06.778 --> 00:48:07.987
<i>Talk to him.</i>

497
00:48:11.115 --> 00:48:12.200
Hey. How you doing?

498
00:48:12.283 --> 00:48:13.368
Hi.

499
00:48:13.451 --> 00:48:14.451
I'm Gil.

500
00:48:15.495 --> 00:48:17.121
Hey, aren't you the DA?

501
00:48:17.205 --> 00:48:18.205
Yeah.

502
00:48:18.373 --> 00:48:20.542
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

503
00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:22.001
Is that right?

504
00:48:22.418 --> 00:48:24.629
I haven't seen you around here before.

505
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:27.674
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

506
00:48:27.757 --> 00:48:30.301
'cause people are all a little on edge.

507
00:48:30.385 --> 00:48:31.945
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

508
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.239
<i>Is that right?</i>

509
00:48:33.263 --> 00:48:34.472
<i>I like that.</i>

510
00:48:34.847 --> 00:48:35.890
Do you want to come over?

511
00:48:35.974 --> 00:48:37.100
Sure.

512
00:48:40.103 --> 00:48:41.437
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

513
00:48:41.521 --> 00:48:43.081
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

514
00:48:43.231 --> 00:48:45.108
<i>- Richie, Glen.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

515
00:48:46.568 --> 00:48:48.069
That's half the DA's office.

516
00:48:48.152 --> 00:48:49.380
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

517
00:48:49.404 --> 00:48:50.404
Hi.

518
00:48:50.446 --> 00:48:52.550
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

519
00:48:52.574 --> 00:48:54.450
Drowning our sorrows.

520
00:48:54.784 --> 00:48:56.077
<i>You want a drop?</i>

521
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.204
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

522
00:49:00.164 --> 00:49:01.833
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

523
00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:04.276
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

524
00:49:04.419 --> 00:49:05.419
He's wasted.

525
00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:06.504
No shit.

526
00:49:08.172 --> 00:49:09.292
<i>I like this girl.</i>

527
00:49:09.632 --> 00:49:11.217
Oh, hey, I like you too!

528
00:49:14.762 --> 00:49:18.099
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

529
00:49:18.182 --> 00:49:19.267
<i>He knows so much.</i>

530
00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:20.703
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

531
00:49:20.727 --> 00:49:23.038
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

532
00:49:23.062 --> 00:49:23.980
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

533
00:49:24.063 --> 00:49:26.041
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

534
00:49:26.065 --> 00:49:28.026
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

535
00:49:30.028 --> 00:49:31.863
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

536
00:49:42.207 --> 00:49:43.416
<i>I mean...</i>

537
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.837
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

538
00:49:48.421 --> 00:49:50.840
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

539
00:49:50.924 --> 00:49:52.693
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

540
00:49:52.717 --> 00:49:54.302
He's talking about the Maroni case.

541
00:49:54.385 --> 00:49:57.680
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

542
00:49:58.264 --> 00:50:00.558
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

543
00:50:00.642 --> 00:50:02.560
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

544
00:50:02.644 --> 00:50:05.331
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

545
00:50:05.355 --> 00:50:06.606
What do you know about that?

546
00:50:08.233 --> 00:50:09.400
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

547
00:50:09.484 --> 00:50:10.484
<i>I want a drink.</i>

548
00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:11.861
Keep him talking.

549
00:50:14.948 --> 00:50:16.032
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

550
00:50:16.115 --> 00:50:17.158
She knows Annika.

551
00:50:17.242 --> 00:50:18.660
No, stay on the DA.

552
00:50:18.743 --> 00:50:20.662
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

553
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:24.916
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

554
00:50:24.999 --> 00:50:26.101
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

555
00:50:26.125 --> 00:50:28.729
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

556
00:50:28.753 --> 00:50:30.004
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

557
00:50:30.088 --> 00:50:32.548
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

558
00:50:32.631 --> 00:50:35.551
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

559
00:50:35.634 --> 00:50:37.195
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

560
00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:38.303
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

561
00:50:43.058 --> 00:50:44.101
<i>Hey.</i>

562
00:50:44.685 --> 00:50:45.769
Hey.

563
00:50:46.937 --> 00:50:50.107
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

564
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.609
How you been?

565
00:50:54.945 --> 00:50:56.655
Yeah, I've been okay.

566
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:59.366
<i>I was just...</i>

567
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.245
I was just headed back upstairs.

568
00:51:03.996 --> 00:51:04.997
Well...

569
00:51:06.081 --> 00:51:07.749
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

570
00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:24.224
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

571
00:51:24.308 --> 00:51:25.952
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

572
00:51:25.976 --> 00:51:27.769
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

573
00:51:27.853 --> 00:51:29.747
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

574
00:51:29.771 --> 00:51:30.856
Wait, what are you doing?

575
00:51:30.939 --> 00:51:33.358
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

576
00:51:37.946 --> 00:51:38.947
Taxi!

577
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:43.911
Hey!

578
00:51:45.621 --> 00:51:46.705
I lost you in there.

579
00:51:46.788 --> 00:51:47.873
Yeah, I gotta go.

580
00:51:48.749 --> 00:51:50.167
Oh, you need a ride?

581
00:51:50.876 --> 00:51:52.169
That's me right there.

582
00:51:58.258 --> 00:51:59.343
Taxi!

583
00:51:59.426 --> 00:52:00.552
I'm good.

584
00:52:02.262 --> 00:52:03.680
I hope, uh...

585
00:52:08.268 --> 00:52:09.686
I'll see you around.

586
00:53:36.356 --> 00:53:40.152
Just hold still.

587
00:54:38.502 --> 00:54:39.419
What do you know about

588
00:54:39.503 --> 00:54:41.797
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

589
00:54:44.883 --> 00:54:46.593
Yeah, sure, there was.

590
00:54:47.302 --> 00:54:49.137
That's the rat we're looking for.

591
00:54:50.055 --> 00:54:51.932
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

592
00:54:52.516 --> 00:54:55.519
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

593
00:54:55.602 --> 00:54:57.062
Where are you getting this?

594
00:54:57.145 --> 00:55:00.023
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

595
00:55:00.816 --> 00:55:02.276
Gil's very nervous.

596
00:55:03.235 --> 00:55:05.779
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

597
00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:07.739
I worked that case.

598
00:55:07.823 --> 00:55:09.783
Riddler's not after you.

599
00:55:09.866 --> 00:55:10.866
How do you know?

600
00:55:11.158 --> 00:55:12.577
You're not corrupt.

601
00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:15.162
Colson's dirty?

602
00:55:21.043 --> 00:55:22.545
Maybe I, uh...

603
00:55:23.212 --> 00:55:26.549
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

604
00:55:26.632 --> 00:55:29.927
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

605
00:55:30.678 --> 00:55:32.471
Who knows how many people it touches.

606
00:55:32.555 --> 00:55:35.766
Politicians. Police. The courts.

607
00:55:37.059 --> 00:55:38.769
It could tear the whole city apart.

608
00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:41.230
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

609
00:55:42.857 --> 00:55:44.609
And Riddler's the match.

610
00:55:45.484 --> 00:55:46.712
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

611
00:55:46.736 --> 00:55:48.088
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

612
00:55:48.112 --> 00:55:49.590
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

613
00:55:49.614 --> 00:55:51.174
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

614
00:55:52.158 --> 00:55:53.802
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

615
00:55:53.826 --> 00:55:55.596
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

616
00:55:56.621 --> 00:55:58.080
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

617
00:55:58.164 --> 00:55:59.266
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

618
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.976
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

619
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.895
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

620
00:56:02.919 --> 00:56:04.399
Pretty.

621
00:56:06.172 --> 00:56:07.548
She a new friend of yours?

622
00:56:12.136 --> 00:56:13.346
I'm not so sure.

623
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.681
Looks like you upset her.

624
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:18.976
Shall I take this as a good sign?

625
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.061
What?

626
00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:21.062
Your attire.

627
00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:23.272
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

628
00:56:23.356 --> 00:56:25.358
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

629
00:56:25.441 --> 00:56:28.110
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

630
00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.738
Riddler might not be able to resist.

631
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:32.281
Oh, that reminds me.

632
00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:37.411
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

633
00:56:37.954 --> 00:56:39.455
The one from the rat maze.

634
00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:42.959
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

635
00:56:43.292 --> 00:56:45.169
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

636
00:56:45.253 --> 00:56:48.506
"You are <i>El Rata A lad a."</i>

637
00:56:49.131 --> 00:56:50.550
<i>Rata A lad a?</i>

638
00:56:50.633 --> 00:56:51.842
"Rat with wings"?

639
00:56:51.926 --> 00:56:54.428
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

640
00:56:54.512 --> 00:56:55.763
Yeah.

641
00:56:57.223 --> 00:56:58.349
A stool pigeon.

642
00:56:58.599 --> 00:57:00.226
Where are your cufflinks?

643
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:01.309
I couldn't find them.

644
00:57:02.728 --> 00:57:04.689
Well, you can't go out like that.

645
00:57:04.772 --> 00:57:06.566
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

646
00:57:10.736 --> 00:57:13.531
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

647
00:57:15.241 --> 00:57:17.451
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

648
00:57:18.452 --> 00:57:20.246
Your father gave them to me.

649
00:57:26.002 --> 00:57:29.130
No more lies! No more lies!

650
00:57:47.315 --> 00:57:50.276
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

651
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:04.582
Is that Bruce Wayne?

652
00:58:04.665 --> 00:58:07.293
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

653
00:58:16.385 --> 00:58:17.386
Hold it.

654
00:58:18.721 --> 00:58:19.972
You good, fellas?

655
00:58:20.556 --> 00:58:21.557
Good.

656
00:58:23.684 --> 00:58:24.769
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

657
00:58:42.578 --> 00:58:43.579
Sir?

658
00:59:03.266 --> 00:59:04.266
Hey!

659
00:59:04.308 --> 00:59:06.310
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

660
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:09.105
Hey, watch it, fellas.

661
00:59:09.564 --> 00:59:11.857
You got the prince of the city there.

662
00:59:14.694 --> 00:59:16.529
Some event, huh?

663
00:59:16.612 --> 00:59:19.574
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

664
00:59:19.657 --> 00:59:22.118
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

665
00:59:22.201 --> 00:59:23.887
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

666
00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:25.913
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

667
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:28.207
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

668
00:59:28.833 --> 00:59:30.293
Wow. Is that right?

669
00:59:30.376 --> 00:59:32.420
His father saved my life.

670
00:59:33.379 --> 00:59:36.591
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

671
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.304
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

672
00:59:41.596 --> 00:59:44.807
Operated right on the dining room table.

673
00:59:44.891 --> 00:59:50.146
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

674
00:59:51.563 --> 00:59:53.565
I remember your face.

675
00:59:55.567 --> 00:59:57.527
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

676
00:59:57.903 --> 01:00:00.030
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

677
01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.949
"Hippocratic oath."

678
01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:06.703
That's good.

679
01:00:07.245 --> 01:00:08.413
Excuse me.

680
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Yes.

681
01:00:27.015 --> 01:00:28.159
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

682
01:00:28.183 --> 01:00:29.827
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

683
01:00:29.851 --> 01:00:32.229
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

684
01:00:32.312 --> 01:00:34.105
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

685
01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:35.629
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

686
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:37.168
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

687
01:00:37.192 --> 01:00:38.610
<i>consider a donation to</i>

688
01:00:38.693 --> 01:00:40.737
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

689
01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.073
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

690
01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:44.366
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

691
01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:47.285
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

692
01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:52.123
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

693
01:00:52.207 --> 01:00:55.418
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

694
01:00:56.419 --> 01:00:58.296
He got what he deserved.

695
01:01:00.215 --> 01:01:01.216
Know what I mean?

696
01:01:02.509 --> 01:01:04.636
Hey, don't I know you?

697
01:01:04.719 --> 01:01:05.804
Bruce Wayne.

698
01:01:06.721 --> 01:01:08.682
Why haven't you called me back?

699
01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:09.766
I'm sorry?

700
01:01:10.058 --> 01:01:12.394
I'm Bella Re√°l. I'm running for mayor.

701
01:01:12.477 --> 01:01:13.746
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

702
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.439
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

703
01:01:16.523 --> 01:01:17.857
Will you walk with me?

704
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:24.364
Mr. Wayne.

705
01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.657
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:26.366 --> 01:01:29.452
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

707
01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:31.872
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

708
01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:34.374
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

709
01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.918
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

710
01:01:37.502 --> 01:01:38.795
Thank you.

711
01:01:39.671 --> 01:01:40.672
My God.

712
01:01:42.507 --> 01:01:45.010
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

713
01:01:45.093 --> 01:01:46.720
I want to continue this.

714
01:01:50.932 --> 01:01:51.932
Excuse me.

715
01:01:53.852 --> 01:01:55.729
I'm so sorry for your loss.

716
01:01:57.939 --> 01:01:58.857
Thank you.

717
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.700
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

718
01:02:02.027 --> 01:02:03.904
Gil Colson is missing.

719
01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:05.280
What?

720
01:02:05.363 --> 01:02:07.657
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

721
01:02:07.741 --> 01:02:08.783
Christ, not again.

722
01:02:08.867 --> 01:02:10.952
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

723
01:02:13.246 --> 01:02:15.290
You got people looking for him, Jim?

724
01:02:15.957 --> 01:02:18.251
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

725
01:02:18.335 --> 01:02:19.252
What'd his wife say?

726
01:02:19.336 --> 01:02:20.736
She hadn't heard from him.

727
01:03:15.308 --> 01:03:16.428
Get out of the car!

728
01:03:16.977 --> 01:03:19.187
Get out of the car and show your hands!

729
01:03:20.605 --> 01:03:21.815
Get out!

730
01:03:32.325 --> 01:03:33.618
Get 'em up!

731
01:03:33.702 --> 01:03:35.453
Get out! Show 'em!

732
01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.501
Christ, it's Colson.

733
01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.295
There's a bomb around his neck!

734
01:03:58.351 --> 01:03:59.895
Let's clear this place out now!

735
01:03:59.978 --> 01:04:02.018
We've got to get this place cleared out!

736
01:04:35.846 --> 01:04:38.599
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

737
01:04:41.602 --> 01:04:43.202
We don't know if he's in on it.

738
01:04:46.148 --> 01:04:47.483
What's he looking at?

739
01:05:06.252 --> 01:05:07.586
Holy shit.

740
01:05:08.629 --> 01:05:10.297
Are you kidding me?

741
01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:13.133
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

742
01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:16.428
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

743
01:05:32.194 --> 01:05:33.404
Please.

744
01:05:33.571 --> 01:05:36.323
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

745
01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:39.010
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

746
01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:40.035
I'm so sorry.

747
01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.204
Looks like a combination lock.

748
01:05:42.288 --> 01:05:43.747
Can't we just cut it off?

749
01:05:44.498 --> 01:05:46.166
Not if you want to keep your head.

750
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.121
<i>You came.</i>

751
01:06:25.956 --> 01:06:27.041
Who are you?

752
01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.584
<i>Me?</i>

753
01:06:31.003 --> 01:06:32.588
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

754
01:06:34.048 --> 01:06:36.467
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

755
01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:40.846
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

756
01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:42.473
"Unmask"?

757
01:06:42.556 --> 01:06:43.724
<i>Yes.</i>

758
01:06:44.558 --> 01:06:47.394
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

759
01:06:47.478 --> 01:06:49.897
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

760
01:06:50.564 --> 01:06:52.900
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

761
01:06:52.983 --> 01:06:54.777
How am I a part of this?

762
01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:56.779
<i>You'll see.</i>

763
01:06:56.862 --> 01:06:58.673
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

764
01:06:58.697 --> 01:07:00.783
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

765
01:07:00.866 --> 01:07:02.117
<i>We're live.</i>

766
01:07:02.201 --> 01:07:05.204
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

767
01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:07.581
<i>At the moment,</i>

768
01:07:07.665 --> 01:07:11.043
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

769
01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:12.169
<i>is dead.</i>

770
01:07:12.253 --> 01:07:14.314
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

771
01:07:14.338 --> 01:07:15.338
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

772
01:07:15.381 --> 01:07:18.509
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

773
01:07:18.592 --> 01:07:21.595
<i>You hear me?</i>

774
01:07:21.679 --> 01:07:22.680
Okay.

775
01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:33.524
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

776
01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:37.444
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

777
01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:40.531
<i>Now,</i>

778
01:07:41.532 --> 01:07:44.326
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

779
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:47.997
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

780
01:07:48.581 --> 01:07:51.000
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

781
01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:54.420
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

782
01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:59.717
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

783
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.052
You want me to do puzzles?

784
01:08:02.136 --> 01:08:04.889
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

785
01:08:04.972 --> 01:08:09.059
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

786
01:08:09.143 --> 01:08:11.478
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

787
01:08:11.562 --> 01:08:13.731
Okay, okay. So I just...

788
01:08:13.814 --> 01:08:15.000
You want me to...

789
01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:17.359
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

790
01:08:17.443 --> 01:08:21.071
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

791
01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:25.826
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

792
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.329
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

793
01:08:28.412 --> 01:08:29.496
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

794
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:30.998
- "Justice."
- Huh?

795
01:08:31.081 --> 01:08:32.124
The answer's "justice."

796
01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.417
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

797
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.085
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

798
01:08:35.169 --> 01:08:39.506
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

799
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:41.967
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

800
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.428
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

801
01:08:44.511 --> 01:08:45.780
Of course, of course. Of course.

802
01:08:45.804 --> 01:08:48.182
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

803
01:08:48.265 --> 01:08:52.394
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

804
01:08:52.478 --> 01:08:56.649
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

805
01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.525
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

806
01:08:58.609 --> 01:08:59.860
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

807
01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:02.172
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

808
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:04.716
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

809
01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:05.991
- How much?
- Nothing!

810
01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.285
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

811
01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:10.722
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

812
01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:11.580
What cases?

813
01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:12.789
He didn't ask me that!

814
01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:14.308
Come on! Ten grand.

815
01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:17.293
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

816
01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:20.004
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

817
01:09:20.088 --> 01:09:23.925
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

818
01:09:24.008 --> 01:09:26.427
<i>Last riddle.</i>

819
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:30.848
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

820
01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:35.228
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

821
01:09:35.311 --> 01:09:37.397
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

822
01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:40.024
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

823
01:09:40.108 --> 01:09:41.961
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

824
01:09:41.985 --> 01:09:43.194
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

825
01:09:43.278 --> 01:09:44.946
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

826
01:09:45.029 --> 01:09:47.049
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

827
01:09:47.073 --> 01:09:48.616
If I go out this way, it's just me.

828
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.828
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

829
01:09:51.911 --> 01:09:53.371
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

830
01:09:53.454 --> 01:09:54.849
- People are watching.
- What people?

831
01:09:54.873 --> 01:09:57.000
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

832
01:09:57.083 --> 01:09:59.252
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

833
01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:00.211
<i>Four!</i>

834
01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:01.730
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

835
01:10:01.754 --> 01:10:03.631
<i>Goodbye!</i>

836
01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:35.264
Who do you think he is under there?

837
01:10:35.288 --> 01:10:36.122
Take it easy.

838
01:10:36.206 --> 01:10:37.207
I want to see.

839
01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:39.981
What is that thing? Leather?

840
01:10:43.504 --> 01:10:44.964
What's he got on his eyes?

841
01:10:45.048 --> 01:10:46.567
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

842
01:10:46.591 --> 01:10:47.860
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

843
01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:49.364
Hey!

844
01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:52.764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

845
01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:54.515
Relax, God damn it!

846
01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:56.100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

847
01:10:57.518 --> 01:11:00.063
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

848
01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:02.565
Colson's blood is on his hands.

849
01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.067
Maybe it's on yours.

850
01:11:05.526 --> 01:11:06.569
What'd you say?

851
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.238
He would rather die than talk.

852
01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:10.323
What was he afraid of?

853
01:11:11.074 --> 01:11:12.158
You?

854
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:20.708
You son of a bitch.

855
01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:24.295
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

856
01:11:24.379 --> 01:11:26.089
You could be an accessory to murder.

857
01:11:26.172 --> 01:11:27.274
Why are we playing games...

858
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.176
Get him! Come on!

859
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.262
Back off! Back off!

860
01:11:32.345 --> 01:11:34.639
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

861
01:11:34.722 --> 01:11:36.808
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

862
01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:39.686
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

863
01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:43.898
You too now?

864
01:11:43.982 --> 01:11:46.526
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

865
01:11:46.609 --> 01:11:49.195
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

866
01:11:49.279 --> 01:11:51.531
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

867
01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:55.827
Okay, give him the room.

868
01:12:11.467 --> 01:12:12.760
Two minutes.

869
01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:26.107
You listen to me.

870
01:12:27.692 --> 01:12:29.694
We gotta get you out of here.

871
01:12:31.362 --> 01:12:33.323
That would put a lot of heat on you.

872
01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:35.074
Well, you punched me in the face.

873
01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:38.620
Take this key.

874
01:12:39.913 --> 01:12:43.291
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

875
01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:46.094
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

876
01:12:47.045 --> 01:12:49.339
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

877
01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:55.094
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

878
01:12:58.514 --> 01:13:01.226
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

879
01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:04.229
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

880
01:13:05.146 --> 01:13:07.774
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

881
01:13:10.485 --> 01:13:12.445
Or he moonlights as a cop.

882
01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:18.593
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

883
01:13:18.618 --> 01:13:20.119
Somebody stop him!

884
01:13:58.323 --> 01:14:00.203
- There he is!
- Freeze!

885
01:14:46.246 --> 01:14:48.286
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

886
01:14:48.707 --> 01:14:49.917
I did.

887
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.378
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

888
01:14:53.462 --> 01:14:55.505
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

889
01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:56.715
I only trust you.

890
01:14:56.798 --> 01:14:59.134
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

891
01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:02.596
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

892
01:15:03.347 --> 01:15:04.473
You think Penguin's the rat?

893
01:15:04.556 --> 01:15:07.601
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

894
01:15:07.684 --> 01:15:09.645
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

895
01:15:09.728 --> 01:15:11.063
DA was a regular too.

896
01:15:11.146 --> 01:15:14.650
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

897
01:15:15.734 --> 01:15:16.944
The <i>Rata A lad a.</i>

898
01:15:17.027 --> 01:15:18.027
The what?

899
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:19.529
Riddler's latest.

900
01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:21.323
The cipher in the maze.

901
01:15:21.406 --> 01:15:23.909
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

902
01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:27.120
A penguin's got wings too.

903
01:15:29.122 --> 01:15:31.083
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

904
01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:32.894
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

905
01:15:32.918 --> 01:15:36.129
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

906
01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:39.383
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

907
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:44.210
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

908
01:15:45.013 --> 01:15:46.098
There's Penguin.

909
01:15:46.181 --> 01:15:48.058
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

910
01:15:49.685 --> 01:15:50.936
<i>You want to move in?</i>

911
01:15:52.813 --> 01:15:54.273
<i>Let's follow.</i>

912
01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:16.336
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

913
01:16:16.461 --> 01:16:17.713
<i>I'm here.</i>

914
01:16:19.131 --> 01:16:20.859
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

915
01:16:20.883 --> 01:16:23.385
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

916
01:16:42.613 --> 01:16:45.157
It's a drug lab. Drops.

917
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.450
This is a buy.

918
01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:49.703
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

919
01:16:49.786 --> 01:16:51.014
Or they never shut it down at all.

920
01:16:51.038 --> 01:16:51.914
<i>What are you saying?</i>

921
01:16:51.997 --> 01:16:55.125
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

922
01:17:19.483 --> 01:17:20.901
This just got complicated.

923
01:17:21.652 --> 01:17:22.819
What do you mean?

924
01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:30.202
Hey! What happened?

925
01:17:30.285 --> 01:17:31.620
You all right?

926
01:17:42.339 --> 01:17:44.132
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

927
01:17:44.258 --> 01:17:45.884
Jesus.

928
01:17:46.635 --> 01:17:48.470
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

929
01:17:48.971 --> 01:17:50.305
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

930
01:17:50.389 --> 01:17:52.099
Is that why you work in the club?

931
01:17:52.849 --> 01:17:53.892
It was all just a score?

932
01:17:53.976 --> 01:17:57.771
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

933
01:17:59.147 --> 01:18:01.066
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

934
01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:13.369
Jesus!

935
01:18:41.939 --> 01:18:43.065
Hey, Vengeance!

936
01:18:45.234 --> 01:18:47.945
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

937
01:19:28.819 --> 01:19:30.446
Kenzie! Get the money!

938
01:19:35.868 --> 01:19:37.119
Hey! What the...

939
01:20:27.753 --> 01:20:29.088
Whoa!

940
01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:33.885
Come on! Come on!

941
01:20:37.054 --> 01:20:38.389
This guy's crazy!

942
01:20:40.141 --> 01:20:41.851
Come on! Hey!

943
01:21:31.317 --> 01:21:32.318
Move!

944
01:22:37.133 --> 01:22:39.010
Get out of the way!

945
01:22:50.146 --> 01:22:51.230
Come on!

946
01:22:59.947 --> 01:23:01.073
Get out of the way!

947
01:23:38.318 --> 01:23:40.362
I got you!

948
01:23:41.613 --> 01:23:42.948
I got you!

949
01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:45.367
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

950
01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:46.910
I got you!

951
01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:06.198
What the hell is this?
Good cop, bat shit cop?

952
01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:08.909
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

953
01:25:08.992 --> 01:25:10.344
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

954
01:25:10.368 --> 01:25:11.786
Cops caught you doing something.

955
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.556
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

956
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.457
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

957
01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.667
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

958
01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:18.960
His drops operation.

959
01:25:19.044 --> 01:25:21.504
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

960
01:25:21.588 --> 01:25:25.217
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

961
01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:27.111
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

962
01:25:27.135 --> 01:25:29.471
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

963
01:25:29.554 --> 01:25:32.766
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

964
01:25:32.849 --> 01:25:34.017
What are you, crazy?

965
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.244
That why you killed the girl?

966
01:25:35.268 --> 01:25:36.268
I didn't kill no girl!

967
01:25:36.311 --> 01:25:38.104
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

968
01:25:38.188 --> 01:25:39.481
But she got too close, right?

969
01:25:39.564 --> 01:25:41.834
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

970
01:25:41.858 --> 01:25:43.818
But somehow Riddler found out too.

971
01:25:43.902 --> 01:25:45.820
He knows so much about you.

972
01:25:45.904 --> 01:25:47.948
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

973
01:25:48.532 --> 01:25:50.742
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

974
01:25:51.159 --> 01:25:52.439
Why don't you start harmonizing?

975
01:25:52.661 --> 01:25:55.330
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

976
01:25:55.413 --> 01:25:56.748
I ain't no rat!

977
01:25:56.831 --> 01:25:58.726
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

978
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:59.894
if he heard this kind of talk?

979
01:25:59.918 --> 01:26:02.087
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

980
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:04.714
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

981
01:26:04.798 --> 01:26:06.358
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

982
01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:08.051
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

983
01:26:08.134 --> 01:26:10.053
Open your eyes!

984
01:26:13.974 --> 01:26:15.559
Are you <i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

985
01:26:15.642 --> 01:26:17.143
<i>El Rata A lad a?</i>

986
01:26:17.227 --> 01:26:19.062
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

987
01:26:19.145 --> 01:26:21.481
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

988
01:26:21.565 --> 01:26:24.150
It says you are <i>El Rata A lad a.</i>

989
01:26:24.234 --> 01:26:25.610
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

990
01:26:25.694 --> 01:26:26.963
Why, you got something to tell us?

991
01:26:26.987 --> 01:26:27.987
Yeah!

992
01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:29.632
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

993
01:26:29.656 --> 01:26:30.656
What?

994
01:26:30.907 --> 01:26:32.242
It's <i>"La."</i>

995
01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:33.618
<i>"La" rata.</i>

996
01:26:34.119 --> 01:26:36.121
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

997
01:26:36.204 --> 01:26:38.081
Jesus! Look at you two.

998
01:26:38.498 --> 01:26:40.750
World's greatest detectives!

999
01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:43.521
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

1000
01:26:43.545 --> 01:26:44.629
Jesus!

1001
01:26:44.713 --> 01:26:46.214
<i>No habla espa√±ol,</i> fellas?

1002
01:26:46.298 --> 01:26:48.300
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1003
01:26:49.718 --> 01:26:50.838
You think he made a mistake?

1004
01:26:50.886 --> 01:26:52.095
He doesn't make mistakes.

1005
01:26:52.178 --> 01:26:53.221
A rat with wings?

1006
01:26:53.305 --> 01:26:54.890
You know what that sounds like to me?

1007
01:26:54.973 --> 01:26:58.143
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1008
01:26:58.226 --> 01:27:00.228
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1009
01:27:05.859 --> 01:27:09.738
"You are <i>el."</i>

1010
01:27:18.413 --> 01:27:19.915
Maybe it was a mistake.

1011
01:27:20.332 --> 01:27:21.166
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1012
01:27:21.249 --> 01:27:22.249
Wait.

1013
01:27:25.503 --> 01:27:26.838
Is that him?

1014
01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:29.549
Holy shit.

1015
01:27:49.444 --> 01:27:51.324
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1016
01:28:20.432 --> 01:28:24.061
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1017
01:28:24.144 --> 01:28:26.981
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1018
01:28:27.064 --> 01:28:28.983
I'll never know where I come from.

1019
01:28:29.858 --> 01:28:31.193
Do you know what I am?"

1020
01:28:31.277 --> 01:28:32.278
Any idea?

1021
01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:33.821
Yeah.

1022
01:28:35.239 --> 01:28:36.490
It's an orphan.

1023
01:28:45.374 --> 01:28:47.126
A mansion in a slum.

1024
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:51.309
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1025
01:28:51.338 --> 01:28:53.048
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1026
01:28:53.674 --> 01:28:55.318
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1027
01:28:55.342 --> 01:28:56.342
Let's go.

1028
01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:01.891
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1029
01:29:02.933 --> 01:29:04.310
You gonna untie me?

1030
01:29:04.393 --> 01:29:06.193
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1031
01:29:09.773 --> 01:29:10.774
Hey!

1032
01:29:12.234 --> 01:29:14.653
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1033
01:29:28.751 --> 01:29:30.920
No guns.

1034
01:29:32.379 --> 01:29:34.423
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1035
01:29:55.528 --> 01:29:56.737
What's that?

1036
01:30:07.248 --> 01:30:09.166
Hey! Hey!

1037
01:30:15.631 --> 01:30:16.840
Drop heads.

1038
01:30:24.265 --> 01:30:25.891
What the hell is that?

1039
01:30:37.653 --> 01:30:40.030
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1040
01:30:40.114 --> 01:30:41.407
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1041
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:46.203
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

1042
01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:48.205
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1043
01:30:49.957 --> 01:30:51.542
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1044
01:30:52.835 --> 01:30:54.628
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1045
01:30:55.838 --> 01:30:59.300
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

1046
01:30:59.842 --> 01:31:01.635
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1047
01:31:01.719 --> 01:31:04.555
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

1048
01:31:04.638 --> 01:31:07.975
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

1049
01:31:08.517 --> 01:31:10.394
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1050
01:31:10.477 --> 01:31:13.272
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

1051
01:31:13.731 --> 01:31:16.567
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

1052
01:31:17.151 --> 01:31:21.197
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

1053
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.199
<i>who need it now,</i>

1054
01:31:23.282 --> 01:31:24.742
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1055
01:31:24.825 --> 01:31:26.243
"Sins of the father."

1056
01:31:26.327 --> 01:31:28.787
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

1057
01:31:31.248 --> 01:31:33.334
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1058
01:31:37.213 --> 01:31:39.423
Shall be visited upon the son.

1059
01:31:41.425 --> 01:31:44.553
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1060
01:31:49.141 --> 01:31:50.559
Hey!

1061
01:32:50.243 --> 01:32:52.787
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1062
01:32:52.871 --> 01:32:54.706
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

1063
01:32:54.789 --> 01:32:56.416
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1064
01:32:57.083 --> 01:32:59.168
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1065
01:33:10.972 --> 01:33:12.724
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1066
01:33:13.892 --> 01:33:15.560
I'm so sorry.

1067
01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.771
I've been trying to reach you.

1068
01:33:21.524 --> 01:33:23.284
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1069
01:33:23.735 --> 01:33:27.488
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1070
01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:51.846
We've sedated him.

1071
01:33:51.930 --> 01:33:53.556
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1072
01:33:54.432 --> 01:33:57.143
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1073
01:33:57.685 --> 01:33:59.437
Is there anyone else to notify?

1074
01:34:00.772 --> 01:34:02.190
Next of kin?

1075
01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.404
No.

1076
01:34:09.531 --> 01:34:11.157
It's just me.

1077
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.511
Selina?

1078
01:36:02.143 --> 01:36:03.144
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1079
01:36:06.272 --> 01:36:08.691
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

1080
01:36:09.567 --> 01:36:10.652
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1081
01:36:29.337 --> 01:36:31.256
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1082
01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:34.801
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1083
01:36:34.884 --> 01:36:37.345
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1084
01:36:38.012 --> 01:36:39.764
How could they do that to her?

1085
01:36:39.847 --> 01:36:41.808
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1086
01:36:41.891 --> 01:36:43.810
Her body was in his car.

1087
01:36:43.893 --> 01:36:46.771
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1088
01:36:46.854 --> 01:36:49.857
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1089
01:36:49.941 --> 01:36:51.544
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1090
01:36:51.568 --> 01:36:53.194
She didn't know any better.

1091
01:36:53.278 --> 01:36:54.672
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1092
01:36:54.696 --> 01:36:56.256
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1093
01:36:56.322 --> 01:36:57.883
It means your choices have consequences.

1094
01:36:57.907 --> 01:37:00.285
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1095
01:37:00.368 --> 01:37:03.079
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1096
01:37:03.162 --> 01:37:04.998
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1097
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:07.500
Compromising yourself for money?

1098
01:37:08.877 --> 01:37:11.129
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1099
01:37:12.755 --> 01:37:16.425
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1100
01:37:16.508 --> 01:37:17.902
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1101
01:37:17.926 --> 01:37:19.261
Falcone owes me that money.

1102
01:37:19.344 --> 01:37:21.096
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1103
01:37:21.179 --> 01:37:22.014
Oh, really? Why's that?

1104
01:37:22.097 --> 01:37:23.015
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1105
01:37:23.098 --> 01:37:24.850
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1106
01:37:24.933 --> 01:37:25.934
would owe you anything.

1107
01:37:26.018 --> 01:37:28.353
Because he's my father!

1108
01:37:37.487 --> 01:37:40.282
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1109
01:37:41.783 --> 01:37:43.076
Just like Anni.

1110
01:37:45.245 --> 01:37:47.789
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1111
01:37:49.875 --> 01:37:51.210
To the club?

1112
01:37:52.127 --> 01:37:53.128
Yeah.

1113
01:37:55.839 --> 01:37:58.717
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1114
01:37:59.176 --> 01:38:00.928
Used to see him there.

1115
01:38:01.678 --> 01:38:03.680
He scared the shit out of me.

1116
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:09.102
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1117
01:38:09.645 --> 01:38:13.482
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1118
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:19.196
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1119
01:38:19.863 --> 01:38:21.365
Strangled.

1120
01:38:21.782 --> 01:38:25.244
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1121
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.206
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1122
01:38:29.289 --> 01:38:31.458
and he didn't say a thing.

1123
01:38:33.293 --> 01:38:35.087
Couldn't even look at me.

1124
01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.592
He owes me that money.

1125
01:38:42.386 --> 01:38:43.804
I'm sorry.

1126
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:46.098
For what I said.

1127
01:38:47.474 --> 01:38:48.892
Oh, it's all right.

1128
01:38:52.437 --> 01:38:54.523
You assume the worst in people.

1129
01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.817
Which, well...

1130
01:38:59.111 --> 01:39:01.029
maybe we're not so different after all.

1131
01:39:06.493 --> 01:39:08.245
Who are you under there?

1132
01:39:14.334 --> 01:39:16.211
What are you hiding?

1133
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:20.424
Are you just...

1134
01:39:22.009 --> 01:39:23.719
hideously scarred?

1135
01:39:25.846 --> 01:39:26.847
Yeah.

1136
01:39:34.104 --> 01:39:35.522
Listen to me.

1137
01:39:37.065 --> 01:39:39.943
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1138
01:39:41.111 --> 01:39:45.782
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1139
01:39:46.408 --> 01:39:49.494
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1140
01:39:49.578 --> 01:39:50.829
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1141
01:39:50.913 --> 01:39:52.193
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1142
01:39:52.247 --> 01:39:54.291
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1143
01:39:54.374 --> 01:39:55.626
I think you'd be on his side.

1144
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:57.389
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1145
01:39:57.419 --> 01:39:59.379
What, do you live in a cave?

1146
01:39:59.463 --> 01:40:01.548
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1147
01:40:02.633 --> 01:40:06.511
Listen, if I can find
that dick bag Kenzie,

1148
01:40:06.595 --> 01:40:07.804
will you help me?

1149
01:40:09.056 --> 01:40:10.349
Please.

1150
01:40:13.143 --> 01:40:15.062
Come on, Vengeance.

1151
01:40:17.522 --> 01:40:19.775
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1152
01:40:19.858 --> 01:40:21.618
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1153
01:40:31.036 --> 01:40:32.579
I told you, baby.

1154
01:40:34.498 --> 01:40:37.084
I can take care of myself.

1155
01:40:47.886 --> 01:40:51.181
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

1156
01:40:59.022 --> 01:41:02.609
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

1157
01:41:02.734 --> 01:41:04.570
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1158
01:41:04.778 --> 01:41:07.197
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

1159
01:41:07.364 --> 01:41:08.824
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1160
01:41:09.533 --> 01:41:11.869
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1161
01:41:13.078 --> 01:41:15.414
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1162
01:41:15.497 --> 01:41:17.958
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1163
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:21.211
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1164
01:41:22.546 --> 01:41:27.217
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

1165
01:41:27.301 --> 01:41:30.971
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1166
01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:33.223
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1167
01:41:33.307 --> 01:41:35.809
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1168
01:41:35.893 --> 01:41:37.519
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1169
01:41:37.603 --> 01:41:43.191
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

1170
01:41:43.275 --> 01:41:47.946
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

1171
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:50.407
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1172
01:41:51.241 --> 01:41:53.743
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

1173
01:41:53.826 --> 01:41:57.747
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

1174
01:41:57.872 --> 01:41:59.916
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1175
01:42:00.416 --> 01:42:04.712
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

1176
01:42:04.795 --> 01:42:07.381
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1177
01:42:07.506 --> 01:42:10.551
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1178
01:42:11.135 --> 01:42:16.390
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1179
01:42:16.891 --> 01:42:19.268
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

1180
01:42:19.352 --> 01:42:21.729
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1181
01:42:21.812 --> 01:42:25.274
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1182
01:42:25.358 --> 01:42:28.152
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1183
01:42:29.695 --> 01:42:31.531
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1184
01:42:37.286 --> 01:42:38.371
Do you know who I am?

1185
01:42:39.997 --> 01:42:41.123
You're Bruce Wayne.

1186
01:42:41.207 --> 01:42:43.084
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1187
01:42:53.844 --> 01:42:54.845
See?

1188
01:43:06.148 --> 01:43:08.776
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1189
01:43:09.527 --> 01:43:11.654
Must have made a fortune.

1190
01:43:12.113 --> 01:43:13.993
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1191
01:43:15.366 --> 01:43:17.827
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1192
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:18.911
No, boss.

1193
01:43:18.995 --> 01:43:21.330
$1,183.

1194
01:43:21.914 --> 01:43:23.875
You know why communism failed, right?

1195
01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:24.959
No, boss.

1196
01:43:26.878 --> 01:43:28.129
Austerity.

1197
01:43:30.381 --> 01:43:32.008
All right. All right.

1198
01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.677
Look at that. Perfect.

1199
01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.560
It's never gonna be that good again.

1200
01:43:38.723 --> 01:43:41.225
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1201
01:43:41.309 --> 01:43:42.476
What are you doing here?

1202
01:43:44.395 --> 01:43:46.230
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1203
01:43:47.148 --> 01:43:48.190
Come on.

1204
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:51.319
See ya, champ.

1205
01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.571
Come on, sweetheart.

1206
01:43:55.531 --> 01:43:56.532
Have a seat.

1207
01:43:58.576 --> 01:44:00.369
I thought I might hear from you.

1208
01:44:01.537 --> 01:44:04.665
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1209
01:44:06.209 --> 01:44:08.002
stirring things up, huh?

1210
01:44:08.085 --> 01:44:09.795
- Is it true?
- What?

1211
01:44:11.088 --> 01:44:12.715
That reporter business?

1212
01:44:14.050 --> 01:44:15.319
What do you want to know here, kid?

1213
01:44:15.343 --> 01:44:18.137
Did you kill him? For my father?

1214
01:44:18.221 --> 01:44:20.973
Look, your father was in trouble.

1215
01:44:21.849 --> 01:44:23.643
This reporter had some dirt.

1216
01:44:23.726 --> 01:44:25.353
Some very...

1217
01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.274
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1218
01:44:30.358 --> 01:44:33.069
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1219
01:44:33.152 --> 01:44:34.671
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1220
01:44:34.695 --> 01:44:36.614
not right before the election.

1221
01:44:37.073 --> 01:44:39.367
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1222
01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:41.077
but he wasn't going for it.

1223
01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:44.330
So, he came to me.

1224
01:44:44.413 --> 01:44:46.791
Well, I never seen him like that.

1225
01:44:47.625 --> 01:44:49.460
He said, "Carmine,

1226
01:44:50.253 --> 01:44:54.966
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1227
01:44:57.385 --> 01:45:00.304
And when fear isn't enough...

1228
01:45:00.972 --> 01:45:02.807
Oof. Hmm.

1229
01:45:04.141 --> 01:45:07.478
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1230
01:45:08.479 --> 01:45:10.314
I handled it.

1231
01:45:12.024 --> 01:45:13.442
I know.

1232
01:45:13.526 --> 01:45:15.778
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1233
01:45:17.029 --> 01:45:18.865
But you'd be surprised

1234
01:45:18.948 --> 01:45:21.325
what even a good man like him

1235
01:45:21.409 --> 01:45:23.995
is capable of in the right situation.

1236
01:45:26.247 --> 01:45:27.707
Do me a favor.

1237
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.084
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1238
01:45:30.793 --> 01:45:32.378
This reporter

1239
01:45:33.212 --> 01:45:34.797
was a lowlife.

1240
01:45:34.881 --> 01:45:36.340
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1241
01:45:37.967 --> 01:45:39.594
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1242
01:45:40.344 --> 01:45:43.598
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1243
01:45:45.016 --> 01:45:48.519
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1244
01:45:48.603 --> 01:45:50.938
that your father would be in my pocket,

1245
01:45:51.689 --> 01:45:52.690
forever.

1246
01:45:53.357 --> 01:45:55.401
He would have done anything

1247
01:45:55.484 --> 01:45:57.653
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1248
01:45:57.737 --> 01:45:59.071
You understand?

1249
01:46:00.281 --> 01:46:04.827
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1250
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:06.954
Do I know it for a fact?

1251
01:46:09.373 --> 01:46:11.459
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1252
01:46:12.835 --> 01:46:15.129
This is what you wanted, huh?

1253
01:46:15.213 --> 01:46:17.632
This little conversation here?

1254
01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:22.220
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1255
01:46:24.847 --> 01:46:26.974
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1256
01:47:36.376 --> 01:47:37.669
You lied to me...

1257
01:47:40.505 --> 01:47:42.132
my whole life.

1258
01:47:47.304 --> 01:47:49.347
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1259
01:47:52.434 --> 01:47:55.729
He told me what he did for my father.

1260
01:47:59.733 --> 01:48:01.234
About Salvatore Maroni.

1261
01:48:03.236 --> 01:48:05.947
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1262
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:07.782
Had my father killed.

1263
01:48:10.243 --> 01:48:12.454
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1264
01:48:15.207 --> 01:48:19.753
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1265
01:48:19.836 --> 01:48:22.172
believing that he was a good man.

1266
01:48:22.255 --> 01:48:23.840
He was a good man.

1267
01:48:25.008 --> 01:48:26.718
You listen to me.

1268
01:48:26.801 --> 01:48:30.222
Your father was a good man.

1269
01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:35.769
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1270
01:48:35.852 --> 01:48:37.771
He had a man killed.

1271
01:48:37.854 --> 01:48:38.939
Why?

1272
01:48:40.106 --> 01:48:43.360
To protect his family image?

1273
01:48:44.444 --> 01:48:45.695
His political aspirations?

1274
01:48:45.779 --> 01:48:49.324
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1275
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:53.453
He was protecting your mother.

1276
01:48:54.412 --> 01:48:57.958
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1277
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:00.168
He cared about her,

1278
01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:01.545
and you,

1279
01:49:01.628 --> 01:49:04.548
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1280
01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:08.093
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1281
01:49:08.969 --> 01:49:12.305
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1282
01:49:12.389 --> 01:49:15.517
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1283
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.435
That's who Falcone is.

1284
01:49:19.688 --> 01:49:21.898
And that was your father's mistake.

1285
01:49:21.982 --> 01:49:24.025
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1286
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:26.862
your father was distraught.

1287
01:49:27.737 --> 01:49:30.949
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1288
01:49:31.032 --> 01:49:33.201
that he would confess everything.

1289
01:49:34.703 --> 01:49:36.705
And that night,

1290
01:49:36.788 --> 01:49:40.709
your father and your mother were killed.

1291
01:49:46.214 --> 01:49:47.966
It was Falcone?

1292
01:49:54.014 --> 01:49:56.141
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1293
01:50:00.854 --> 01:50:04.399
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1294
01:50:04.482 --> 01:50:07.235
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1295
01:50:07.319 --> 01:50:12.532
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1296
01:50:14.284 --> 01:50:18.163
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1297
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:20.624
I know you always blamed yourself.

1298
01:50:20.707 --> 01:50:23.251
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1299
01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.714
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1300
01:50:29.132 --> 01:50:31.509
but I didn't know how to help.

1301
01:50:31.593 --> 01:50:34.095
I could teach you how to fight,

1302
01:50:35.472 --> 01:50:38.141
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1303
01:50:38.225 --> 01:50:40.060
You needed a father.

1304
01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:44.439
And all you had was me.

1305
01:50:46.816 --> 01:50:48.026
I'm sorry.

1306
01:50:49.778 --> 01:50:51.696
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1307
01:50:58.495 --> 01:50:59.579
God.

1308
01:51:02.624 --> 01:51:07.045
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1309
01:51:09.756 --> 01:51:11.883
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1310
01:51:18.305 --> 01:51:19.557
I mean,

1311
01:51:20.766 --> 01:51:22.893
I'm not afraid to die.

1312
01:51:24.645 --> 01:51:27.022
I realize now there's something

1313
01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:30.025
I haven't got past.

1314
01:51:30.943 --> 01:51:32.695
This fear...

1315
01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:38.117
of ever going through any of that again.

1316
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:44.582
Of losing somebody I care about.

1317
01:52:35.174 --> 01:52:36.174
Hey.

1318
01:52:36.217 --> 01:52:38.969
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1319
01:52:39.053 --> 01:52:40.971
I thought it was you.

1320
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:55.444
- I found him!
- I see that.

1321
01:52:55.528 --> 01:52:57.029
He had my shit and my phone.

1322
01:52:57.112 --> 01:52:58.381
She left a message
the night they took her.

1323
01:52:58.405 --> 01:52:59.323
She called me...

1324
01:52:59.406 --> 01:53:01.116
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1325
01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.493
She got my gun!

1326
01:53:03.827 --> 01:53:05.538
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1327
01:53:07.081 --> 01:53:09.625
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1328
01:53:14.213 --> 01:53:16.298
Here. Listen.

1329
01:53:18.259 --> 01:53:19.927
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1330
01:53:20.052 --> 01:53:22.252
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1331
01:53:22.304 --> 01:53:24.390
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1332
01:53:24.473 --> 01:53:25.808
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1333
01:53:25.891 --> 01:53:27.601
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1334
01:53:27.685 --> 01:53:28.787
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1335
01:53:28.811 --> 01:53:30.104
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1336
01:53:30.187 --> 01:53:32.857
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1337
01:53:34.733 --> 01:53:36.777
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1338
01:53:37.486 --> 01:53:40.030
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
<i>- No, nothing. He...</i>

1339
01:53:40.114 --> 01:53:43.033
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1340
01:53:43.117 --> 01:53:45.828
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1341
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:48.372
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1342
01:53:49.081 --> 01:53:51.959
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1343
01:53:52.042 --> 01:53:54.753
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1344
01:53:54.837 --> 01:53:57.023
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1345
01:53:57.047 --> 01:54:00.175
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1346
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:03.554
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1347
01:54:04.638 --> 01:54:05.973
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1348
01:54:06.765 --> 01:54:10.311
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1349
01:54:10.811 --> 01:54:12.021
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1350
01:54:12.104 --> 01:54:14.064
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1351
01:54:14.148 --> 01:54:15.441
<i>The deal.</i>

1352
01:54:15.524 --> 01:54:20.446
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1353
01:54:20.529 --> 01:54:23.240
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1354
01:54:23.324 --> 01:54:25.701
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1355
01:54:25.784 --> 01:54:26.911
<i>Right.</i>

1356
01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:29.038
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1357
01:54:29.997 --> 01:54:32.166
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1358
01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.234
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1359
01:54:41.258 --> 01:54:42.801
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1360
01:54:42.885 --> 01:54:45.930
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1361
01:54:55.147 --> 01:54:56.440
<i>Rata A lad a.</i>

1362
01:55:01.195 --> 01:55:02.988
A falcon has wings too.

1363
01:55:03.322 --> 01:55:05.157
Falcone is the rat?

1364
01:55:16.126 --> 01:55:19.296
Falcone works for you guys?

1365
01:55:19.964 --> 01:55:22.508
The mayor? The DA?

1366
01:55:25.511 --> 01:55:26.595
No.

1367
01:55:29.682 --> 01:55:30.975
We work for him.

1368
01:55:31.976 --> 01:55:33.227
Everybody does.

1369
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:34.311
How?

1370
01:55:34.395 --> 01:55:35.980
Through Renewal.

1371
01:55:36.772 --> 01:55:38.148
Renewal is everything.

1372
01:55:38.232 --> 01:55:39.632
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1373
01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:43.863
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1374
01:55:43.946 --> 01:55:47.533
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1375
01:55:47.616 --> 01:55:50.995
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1376
01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:53.163
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1377
01:55:53.247 --> 01:55:54.956
Everybody got a piece.

1378
01:55:55.039 --> 01:55:56.875
But Falcone wanted more.

1379
01:55:58.668 --> 01:56:01.880
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1380
01:56:03.298 --> 01:56:05.633
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1381
01:56:06.009 --> 01:56:08.720
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1382
01:56:08.803 --> 01:56:11.264
then install them all as his puppets.

1383
01:56:11.347 --> 01:56:13.892
You think this goddamn election matters?

1384
01:56:15.518 --> 01:56:17.437
Falcone's the mayor.

1385
01:56:18.396 --> 01:56:20.899
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1386
01:56:20.982 --> 01:56:22.358
Come on, Vengeance.

1387
01:56:23.067 --> 01:56:24.903
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1388
01:56:25.612 --> 01:56:27.298
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1389
01:56:27.322 --> 01:56:28.156
No!

1390
01:56:29.616 --> 01:56:30.825
We'll get him.

1391
01:56:31.492 --> 01:56:33.369
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1392
01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.579
He owns the city!

1393
01:56:34.662 --> 01:56:35.914
Cross that line...

1394
01:56:36.706 --> 01:56:37.999
you'll become just like him.

1395
01:56:38.708 --> 01:56:40.251
Listen to me.

1396
01:56:40.335 --> 01:56:42.212
Don't throw your life away.

1397
01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:50.136
Don't worry, honey.

1398
01:56:53.223 --> 01:56:54.682
I got nine of 'em.

1399
01:56:54.807 --> 01:56:56.768
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1400
01:56:58.061 --> 01:56:59.354
Oh, God!

1401
01:57:08.655 --> 01:57:09.924
She won't get out of there alive.

1402
01:57:09.948 --> 01:57:12.534
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1403
01:57:12.617 --> 01:57:13.618
I have to stop her.

1404
01:57:13.785 --> 01:57:14.785
Don't you mean "we"?

1405
01:57:16.079 --> 01:57:17.622
I gotta do this my way.

1406
01:57:17.956 --> 01:57:18.957
And then what?

1407
01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:21.209
We do what Riddler said.

1408
01:57:22.043 --> 01:57:23.670
Bring the rat into the light.

1409
01:57:59.622 --> 01:58:01.666
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1410
01:58:01.749 --> 01:58:03.209
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1411
01:58:03.835 --> 01:58:05.169
Tell him it's about Annika.

1412
01:58:08.423 --> 01:58:09.757
Hey!

1413
01:58:10.592 --> 01:58:12.010
Look who it is, huh?

1414
01:58:12.093 --> 01:58:14.512
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1415
01:58:14.596 --> 01:58:16.598
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1416
01:58:16.764 --> 01:58:18.224
Absolutely.

1417
01:58:19.976 --> 01:58:20.977
Alone?

1418
01:58:37.535 --> 01:58:38.620
Hey!

1419
01:58:49.172 --> 01:58:50.441
I'm just so worried.

1420
01:58:50.465 --> 01:58:52.091
I don't know where she is.

1421
01:58:53.843 --> 01:58:57.222
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1422
01:58:57.305 --> 01:59:00.725
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1423
01:59:02.227 --> 01:59:04.604
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1424
01:59:06.064 --> 01:59:07.190
I'm sorry.

1425
01:59:07.398 --> 01:59:08.483
It's okay.

1426
01:59:08.566 --> 01:59:10.693
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1427
01:59:10.860 --> 01:59:13.738
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1428
01:59:17.992 --> 01:59:18.910
Mr. Falcone?

1429
01:59:18.993 --> 01:59:20.453
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1430
01:59:20.537 --> 01:59:23.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1431
01:59:25.833 --> 01:59:27.335
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1432
01:59:27.418 --> 01:59:28.836
I'll be right back.

1433
01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:45.228
Holy shit.

1434
01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:47.039
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

1442

1450
02:00:30.732 --> 02:00:31.983
Hey, Dad.

1451
02:00:33.026 --> 02:00:34.026
What?

1452
02:00:34.484 --> 02:00:36.528
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1453
02:00:38.155 --> 02:00:39.615
You remember her?

1454
02:00:41.658 --> 02:00:42.701
Yeah.

1455
02:00:46.997 --> 02:00:48.141
Just put down the gun, honey.

1456
02:00:48.165 --> 02:00:49.249
This is for my mother.

1457
02:01:46.515 --> 02:01:47.683
I see him!

1458
02:02:31.727 --> 02:02:33.478
You don't think this hurts me?

1459
02:02:38.066 --> 02:02:40.360
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1460
02:02:56.752 --> 02:02:58.587
You made me do this.

1461
02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:01.798
Just like your mother.

1462
02:03:07.804 --> 02:03:09.139
He has to pay!

1463
02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:14.300
You don't have to pay with him.

1464
02:03:17.814 --> 02:03:19.316
You paid enough.

1465
02:03:53.892 --> 02:03:55.018
Jesus.

1466
02:03:55.102 --> 02:03:57.813
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1467
02:03:57.896 --> 02:04:00.983
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1468
02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:02.317
I'm gonna start crying,

1469
02:04:02.401 --> 02:04:04.903
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1470
02:04:04.987 --> 02:04:06.613
Let me tell you something.

1471
02:04:06.697 --> 02:04:08.407
Whatever I know,

1472
02:04:08.490 --> 02:04:10.367
whatever I've done,

1473
02:04:10.450 --> 02:04:14.788
it's all going with me to my grave.

1474
02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:27.301
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1475
02:04:28.927 --> 02:04:31.221
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1476
02:04:39.146 --> 02:04:41.481
I guess we don't all work for you.

1477
02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:52.034
You have the right to remain silent.

1478
02:04:52.868 --> 02:04:56.371
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1479
02:04:56.455 --> 02:04:57.815
You have the right to an attorney.

1480
02:04:57.873 --> 02:04:59.041
If you cannot afford one,

1481
02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:00.918
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1482
02:05:01.001 --> 02:05:02.711
Do you understand these rights?

1483
02:05:04.213 --> 02:05:05.797
Do you understand?

1484
02:05:07.758 --> 02:05:08.842
Yeah.

1485
02:05:08.926 --> 02:05:11.011
I'll see you when I walk out.

1486
02:05:11.094 --> 02:05:12.155
With these rights in mind,

1487
02:05:12.179 --> 02:05:13.531
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1488
02:05:13.555 --> 02:05:14.805
Goddamn rat.

1489
02:05:16.766 --> 02:05:18.100
What'd you say?

1490
02:05:18.184 --> 02:05:19.936
Enjoy your night at Black gate, Carmine.

1491
02:05:21.062 --> 02:05:22.313
Probably be your last.

1492
02:05:22.563 --> 02:05:25.608
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1493
02:05:25.691 --> 02:05:26.776
Maybe I am.

1494
02:05:26.859 --> 02:05:28.069
Really, Oz?

1495
02:05:28.152 --> 02:05:32.865
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1496
02:05:32.949 --> 02:05:34.033
I'll spray paint your ass!

1497
02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:39.440
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1498
02:05:39.664 --> 02:05:41.666
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1499
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.460
Get your hands off of me!

1500
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:06.023
"Bring him into the light.

1501
02:06:09.610 --> 02:06:11.571
And you'll find where I'm at."

1502
02:06:11.654 --> 02:06:12.738
There!

1503
02:06:12.822 --> 02:06:14.657
The shots came from up there!

1504
02:06:16.242 --> 02:06:17.243
It's Riddler.

1505
02:06:19.328 --> 02:06:20.496
Gage, on me.

1506
02:06:20.580 --> 02:06:23.291
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1507
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:38.699
He's gone.

1508
02:07:48.501 --> 02:07:50.461
He's been here this whole time.

1509
02:07:50.545 --> 02:07:52.880
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1510
02:07:52.964 --> 02:07:54.149
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1511
02:07:54.173 --> 02:07:56.902
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

1512
02:07:56.926 --> 02:07:59.387
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1513
02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:02.390
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

1514
02:08:17.905 --> 02:08:19.991
Police! Hands up!

1515
02:08:23.035 --> 02:08:26.539
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1516
02:08:45.683 --> 02:08:47.602
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1517
02:08:50.563 --> 02:08:51.856
Stay still!

1518
02:08:51.939 --> 02:08:52.940
Now!

1519
02:09:21.594 --> 02:09:23.387
Which one is you?

1520
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:24.972
You tell me.

1521
02:09:25.806 --> 02:09:27.266
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1522
02:09:30.353 --> 02:09:32.104
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1523
02:09:46.619 --> 02:09:49.539
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

1524
02:09:49.622 --> 02:09:52.208
<i>have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.</i>

1525
02:09:52.291 --> 02:09:54.876
<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live

1526
02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.002
Hey.

1527
02:10:20.443 --> 02:10:22.153
What are all these diaries?

1528
02:10:22.237 --> 02:10:24.656
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1529
02:10:24.739 --> 02:10:28.285
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1530
02:10:28.368 --> 02:10:29.911
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1531
02:10:29.995 --> 02:10:32.289
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

1532
02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:34.207
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1533
02:10:34.291 --> 02:10:36.710
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1534
02:10:36.793 --> 02:10:38.545
What about chain of evidence?

1535
02:10:39.379 --> 02:10:40.589
You should see this.

1536
02:10:46.553 --> 02:10:48.054
He's wearing gloves.

1537
02:10:49.514 --> 02:10:51.766
"Friday, July 16th.

1538
02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:55.562
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1539
02:10:55.896 --> 02:10:58.940
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1540
02:10:59.024 --> 02:11:00.442
But then, today, I saw it.

1541
02:11:00.525 --> 02:11:04.654
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1542
02:11:05.989 --> 02:11:07.782
'Renewal.'

1543
02:11:07.866 --> 02:11:12.287
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1544
02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:15.498
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1545
02:11:15.582 --> 02:11:18.919
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1546
02:11:19.002 --> 02:11:21.463
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1547
02:11:21.546 --> 02:11:24.549
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1548
02:11:25.675 --> 02:11:27.570
"If you want people to understand,

1549
02:11:27.594 --> 02:11:29.429
really understand,

1550
02:11:29.512 --> 02:11:31.806
you can't just give them the answers.

1551
02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:33.350
You have to confront them,

1552
02:11:33.433 --> 02:11:35.852
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1553
02:11:35.936 --> 02:11:38.104
just like they tortured me.

1554
02:11:38.188 --> 02:11:40.982
I know now what I must become."

1555
02:11:43.944 --> 02:11:45.278
Jesus.

1556
02:11:51.368 --> 02:11:53.328
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1557
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:55.372
This one's not a rat.

1558
02:12:12.013 --> 02:12:13.139
What is that?

1559
02:12:44.754 --> 02:12:46.023
Some kind of pry tool?

1560
02:12:46.047 --> 02:12:47.424
Is it a chisel?

1561
02:12:47.507 --> 02:12:48.967
It's a murder weapon.

1562
02:12:49.050 --> 02:12:50.427
He killed Mitchell with it.

1563
02:12:51.094 --> 02:12:53.972
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1564
02:13:02.564 --> 02:13:04.566
"My confession"?

1565
02:13:04.649 --> 02:13:07.527
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1566
02:13:07.611 --> 02:13:08.987
This isn't over.

1567
02:13:09.070 --> 02:13:11.590
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1568
02:13:11.907 --> 02:13:14.117
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1569
02:13:22.209 --> 02:13:24.419
His final post was last night.

1570
02:13:24.502 --> 02:13:27.714
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1571
02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:30.800
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1572
02:13:30.926 --> 02:13:34.346
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1573
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:48.235
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1574
02:13:49.861 --> 02:13:51.571
"The Truth Unmasked."

1575
02:13:52.405 --> 02:13:54.032
I think I'm his last target.

1576
02:13:56.618 --> 02:13:57.702
You?

1577
02:13:58.078 --> 02:14:00.121
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1578
02:14:00.664 --> 02:14:02.040
What is?

1579
02:14:02.499 --> 02:14:03.917
The Batman.

1580
02:14:09.297 --> 02:14:10.465
Yeah?

1581
02:14:21.768 --> 02:14:22.978
Right.

1582
02:14:25.856 --> 02:14:29.818
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1583
02:14:37.283 --> 02:14:38.784
You're a good cop.

1584
02:15:03.392 --> 02:15:05.769
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1585
02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:08.355
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1586
02:15:08.439 --> 02:15:09.982
"Want"?

1587
02:15:10.566 --> 02:15:14.195
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

1588
02:15:15.404 --> 02:15:16.739
<i>For this moment.</i>

1589
02:15:17.781 --> 02:15:20.784
I've been invisible my whole life.

1590
02:15:21.869 --> 02:15:24.496
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1591
02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:28.459
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1592
02:15:28.542 --> 02:15:30.377
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1593
02:15:40.763 --> 02:15:42.723
<i>Bruce...</i>

1594
02:15:45.601 --> 02:15:47.436
<i>Wayne.</i>

1595
02:15:49.813 --> 02:15:53.567
Bruce...

1596
02:15:54.985 --> 02:15:57.863
<i>Wayne.</i>

1597
02:16:09.124 --> 02:16:11.544
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1598
02:16:14.129 --> 02:16:17.508
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

1599
02:16:17.591 --> 02:16:19.969
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1600
02:16:22.429 --> 02:16:26.684
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

1601
02:16:27.226 --> 02:16:30.771
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

1602
02:16:30.855 --> 02:16:34.525
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1603
02:16:35.109 --> 02:16:36.652
<i>Orphan.</i>

1604
02:16:42.324 --> 02:16:47.454
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

1605
02:16:48.747 --> 02:16:53.377
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

1606
02:16:54.044 --> 02:16:55.588
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1607
02:16:58.215 --> 02:17:00.885
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1608
02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:03.846
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1609
02:17:05.139 --> 02:17:09.185
<i>Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.</i>

1610
02:17:10.895 --> 02:17:15.566
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

1611
02:17:16.734 --> 02:17:19.904
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1612
02:17:19.987 --> 02:17:22.281
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1613
02:17:23.574 --> 02:17:26.160
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1614
02:17:29.079 --> 02:17:32.249
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

1615
02:17:32.333 --> 02:17:35.252
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

1616
02:17:35.336 --> 02:17:36.337
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1617
02:17:37.796 --> 02:17:39.840
<i>Bruce...</i>

1618
02:17:40.883 --> 02:17:42.801
<i>Wayne.</i>

1619
02:17:46.472 --> 02:17:49.558
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1620
02:17:52.978 --> 02:17:56.106
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1621
02:17:57.566 --> 02:18:01.445
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1622
02:18:04.615 --> 02:18:05.783
<i>God.</i>

1623
02:18:06.784 --> 02:18:08.077
<i>Look at you.</i>

1624
02:18:09.745 --> 02:18:12.206
Your mask is amazing.

1625
02:18:12.289 --> 02:18:15.209
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1626
02:18:15.292 --> 02:18:16.377
Ain't it funny?

1627
02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:20.881
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

1628
02:18:22.341 --> 02:18:24.385
<i>You and I both know</i>

1629
02:18:25.344 --> 02:18:27.846
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1630
02:18:27.930 --> 02:18:31.559
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1631
02:18:31.642 --> 02:18:33.185
<i>No shame,</i>

1632
02:18:34.103 --> 02:18:35.104
<i>no limits.</i>

1633
02:18:35.187 --> 02:18:36.856
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1634
02:18:37.731 --> 02:18:38.732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1635
02:18:38.816 --> 02:18:40.526
<i>All those cards.</i>

1636
02:18:40.609 --> 02:18:41.819
<i>I told you,</i>

1637
02:18:42.528 --> 02:18:44.506
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

1638
02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:46.740
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

1639
02:18:46.824 --> 02:18:48.284
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1640
02:18:48.367 --> 02:18:50.428
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

1641
02:18:50.452 --> 02:18:51.620
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1642
02:18:51.704 --> 02:18:52.705
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1643
02:18:52.788 --> 02:18:55.291
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1644
02:18:55.374 --> 02:18:57.793
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

1645
02:18:57.877 --> 02:19:01.046
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

1646
02:19:01.130 --> 02:19:02.770
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1647
02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.049
You gave me that.

1648
02:19:04.133 --> 02:19:05.259
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1649
02:19:05.342 --> 02:19:07.928
You showed me what was possible.

1650
02:19:08.012 --> 02:19:12.892
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

1651
02:19:12.975 --> 02:19:14.518
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1652
02:19:14.602 --> 02:19:16.102
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1653
02:19:17.228 --> 02:19:18.313
<i>What?</i>

1654
02:19:18.396 --> 02:19:20.565
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

1655
02:19:20.648 --> 02:19:22.025
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1656
02:19:22.108 --> 02:19:23.610
You think you'll be remembered?

1657
02:19:23.693 --> 02:19:25.361
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1658
02:19:25.862 --> 02:19:27.614
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

1659
02:19:27.697 --> 02:19:29.365
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

1660
02:19:29.449 --> 02:19:30.491
<i>No, no!</i>

1661
02:19:30.575 --> 02:19:31.575
<i>A nobody!</i>

1662
02:19:33.286 --> 02:19:35.079
<i>No!</i>

1663
02:19:36.998 --> 02:19:39.375
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1664
02:19:39.626 --> 02:19:42.212
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

1665
02:19:43.171 --> 02:19:46.799
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1666
02:19:46.883 --> 02:19:49.510
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1667
02:19:50.511 --> 02:19:52.513
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1668
02:19:52.889 --> 02:19:56.184
We could watch the whole thing together.

1669
02:19:56.267 --> 02:19:57.268
<i>Watch what?</i>

1670
02:19:57.352 --> 02:19:59.103
<i>Everything!</i>

1671
02:20:07.445 --> 02:20:09.113
<i>It was all there.</i>

1672
02:20:11.282 --> 02:20:13.618
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1673
02:20:17.914 --> 02:20:21.834
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

1674
02:20:23.878 --> 02:20:25.964
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1675
02:20:26.422 --> 02:20:27.674
<i>What have you done?</i>

1676
02:20:28.383 --> 02:20:33.263
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1677
02:20:36.099 --> 02:20:37.934
<i>You.</i>

1678
02:20:39.602 --> 02:20:41.729
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

1679
02:20:43.064 --> 02:20:44.607
<i>What have you done?</i>

1680
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:51.990
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1681
02:20:52.407 --> 02:20:54.284
<i>What have you done?</i>

1682
02:20:56.744 --> 02:20:58.121
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1683
02:20:58.288 --> 02:20:59.706
<i>What have you done?</i>

1684
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:07.088
<i>Maria</i>

1685
02:21:07.255 --> 02:21:12.802
<i>Gratia plena</i>

1686
02:21:44.667 --> 02:21:46.044
Hey!

1687
02:21:47.045 --> 02:21:48.338
What are you doing in here?

1688
02:22:06.272 --> 02:22:08.858
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1689
02:22:15.448 --> 02:22:17.909
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1690
02:22:18.785 --> 02:22:21.538
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1691
02:22:26.209 --> 02:22:29.254
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1692
02:22:29.337 --> 02:22:31.506
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1693
02:22:31.589 --> 02:22:33.841
It's a tucker.

1694
02:22:51.651 --> 02:22:52.652
Huh.

1695
02:23:07.834 --> 02:23:10.628
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1696
02:23:10.712 --> 02:23:12.213
What are you doing?

1697
02:23:42.744 --> 02:23:44.162
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

1698
02:23:44.495 --> 02:23:46.706
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

1699
02:23:46.789 --> 02:23:49.751
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

1700
02:23:49.834 --> 02:23:50.835
Detonators?

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

1712
02:24:32.668 --> 02:24:34.545
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

1713
02:24:34.628 --> 02:24:37.589
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

1714
02:24:37.673 --> 02:24:41.510
<i>masquerading under the guise of renewal.</i>

1715
02:24:41.593 --> 02:24:45.430
<i>But unmasking is not enough.</i>

<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

<i>And now it is time</i>

1718

<i>for retribution.</i>

1719
02:24:57.651 --> 02:25:00.445
<i>I've parked seven vans</i>

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

Call Gordon.

1730
02:25:48.994 --> 02:25:51.121
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1731

<i>As breaking news</i>

<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

1737

02:27:17.207 --> 02:27:19.376
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1751
02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:21.587
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1752
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:24.548
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1753
02:27:24.631 --> 02:27:26.651
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1754
02:27:36.226 --> 02:27:37.954
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1755
02:27:37.978 --> 02:27:39.539
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1756
02:27:39.563 --> 02:27:41.398
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1757
02:27:41.481 --> 02:27:42.733
We got an active situation.

1758
02:27:42.858 --> 02:27:44.210
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1759
02:27:44.234 --> 02:27:45.503
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1760
02:27:45.527 --> 02:27:46.445
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1761
02:27:46.528 --> 02:27:47.362
Come!

1762
02:28:23.398 --> 02:28:24.876
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1763
02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:25.776
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1764
02:28:25.859 --> 02:28:27.295
The water's already started to breach.

1765
02:28:27.319 --> 02:28:28.922
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1766
02:28:28.946 --> 02:28:31.216
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1767
02:28:31.240 --> 02:28:33.134
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1768
02:28:33.158 --> 02:28:35.552
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

1769
02:28:35.576 --> 02:28:37.888
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Re√°l.

1770
02:28:37.912 --> 02:28:40.164
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1771
02:28:40.248 --> 02:28:42.083
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1772
02:28:42.166 --> 02:28:45.169
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1773
02:28:45.253 --> 02:28:46.754
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1774
02:28:51.926 --> 02:28:55.388
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1775
02:28:55.471 --> 02:28:57.765
Please! I just need your attention!

1776
02:29:13.656 --> 02:29:14.782
You're okay!

1777
02:30:45.706 --> 02:30:48.334
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1778
02:30:48.417 --> 02:30:49.627
Follow me, sir.

1779
02:32:59.632 --> 02:33:01.133
No, no. It's okay.

1780
02:33:01.217 --> 02:33:02.260
It's okay.

1781
02:33:03.427 --> 02:33:04.470
It's okay.

1782
02:33:06.097 --> 02:33:08.224
It's done now. It's done.

1783
02:33:10.935 --> 02:33:12.270
It's over.

1784
02:34:08.116 --> 02:34:11.578
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1785
02:34:12.287 --> 02:34:14.623
Take it easy. Easy.

1786
02:34:43.193 --> 02:34:44.319
Jesus.

1787
02:34:54.162 --> 02:34:55.830
Who the hell are you?

1788
02:35:00.043 --> 02:35:01.044
Me?

1789
02:35:04.214 --> 02:35:05.632
I'm Vengeance.

1790
02:38:38.093 --> 02:38:40.387
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1791
02:38:43.599 --> 02:38:45.476
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1792
02:38:47.811 --> 02:38:49.563
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1793
02:38:51.857 --> 02:38:53.859
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1794
02:38:54.777 --> 02:38:56.403
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1795
02:38:59.615 --> 02:39:03.327
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1796
02:39:03.410 --> 02:39:05.955
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>

1797
02:39:07.122 --> 02:39:10.834
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

1798
02:39:13.796 --> 02:39:16.924
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

1799
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:19.677
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1800
02:39:20.302 --> 02:39:21.762
But not just our city.

1801
02:39:22.471 --> 02:39:26.684
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1802
02:39:26.767 --> 02:39:28.853
in our elected officials,

1803
02:39:28.936 --> 02:39:30.229
in each other.

1804
02:39:31.021 --> 02:39:34.358
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1805
02:39:38.696 --> 02:39:40.364
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1806
02:39:41.824 --> 02:39:43.993
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1807
02:39:46.078 --> 02:39:47.997
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1808
02:39:50.374 --> 02:39:53.419
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1809
02:39:54.753 --> 02:39:57.131
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1810
02:39:59.550 --> 02:40:01.594
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1811
02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:06.307
<i>People need hope.</i>

1812
02:40:07.516 --> 02:40:09.727
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1813
02:40:13.522 --> 02:40:15.191
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1814
02:40:16.108 --> 02:40:17.484
<i>scarred,</i>

1815
02:40:18.402 --> 02:40:19.653
<i>like me.</i>

1816
02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:23.866
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1817
02:40:25.242 --> 02:40:27.953
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

1818
02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.332
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1819
02:40:32.833 --> 02:40:34.710
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1820
02:40:36.587 --> 02:40:38.505
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1821
02:40:39.465 --> 02:40:40.966
<i>to endure...</i>

1822
02:40:42.343 --> 02:40:44.470
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1823
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:49.558
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

1824
02:40:49.642 --> 02:40:52.436
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

1825
02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:54.104
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1826
02:40:54.188 --> 02:40:55.874
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1827
02:40:55.898 --> 02:40:58.901
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

1828
02:40:58.984 --> 02:41:01.529
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1829
02:41:01.612 --> 02:41:04.007
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

1830
02:41:04.031 --> 02:41:06.492
Isn't that just terrible?

1831
02:41:07.868 --> 02:41:09.787
Him...

1832
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:12.748
raining on your parade like that?

1833
02:41:18.462 --> 02:41:20.464
What is it they say?

1834
02:41:21.632 --> 02:41:23.801
"One day you're on top,

1835
02:41:25.344 --> 02:41:27.012
the next...

1836
02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:30.307
you're a clown."

1837
02:41:32.685 --> 02:41:33.853
Well,

1838
02:41:35.646 --> 02:41:38.482
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1839
02:41:40.776 --> 02:41:43.445
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1840
02:41:44.738 --> 02:41:46.574
You did so well.

1841
02:41:51.078 --> 02:41:52.079
And you know,

1842
02:41:53.747 --> 02:41:56.959
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1843
02:42:07.011 --> 02:42:08.387
Who are you?

1844
02:42:08.929 --> 02:42:11.348
Well, that's the question,

1845
02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:13.767
isn't it?

1846
02:42:16.687 --> 02:42:19.064
Riddle me this...

1847
02:42:21.525 --> 02:42:23.652
"The less of them you have,

1848
02:42:24.403 --> 02:42:28.240
the more one is worth."

1849
02:42:33.662 --> 02:42:35.414
A friend.

1850
02:43:01.648 --> 02:43:03.048
You're leaving.

1851
02:43:03.566 --> 02:43:04.651
Jesus.

1852
02:43:06.402 --> 02:43:07.987
Don't you ever just say hello?

1853
02:43:13.076 --> 02:43:14.494
Where will you go?

1854
02:43:15.995 --> 02:43:18.414
I don't know. Upstate.

1855
02:43:18.831 --> 02:43:20.542
Bludhaven, maybe.

1856
02:43:21.417 --> 02:43:22.418
Why?

1857
02:43:23.628 --> 02:43:24.837
You asking me to stay?

1858
02:43:31.886 --> 02:43:34.013
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1859
02:43:34.430 --> 02:43:36.766
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1860
02:43:36.850 --> 02:43:38.768
There's gonna be a power grab.

1861
02:43:40.395 --> 02:43:41.521
It'll be bloody.

1862
02:43:42.146 --> 02:43:43.356
I know.

1863
02:43:44.899 --> 02:43:45.984
But the city can change.

1864
02:43:46.067 --> 02:43:47.318
It won't.

1865
02:43:48.444 --> 02:43:49.445
I have to try.

1866
02:43:49.529 --> 02:43:51.329
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1867
02:43:53.616 --> 02:43:54.742
Listen.

1868
02:43:57.161 --> 02:43:58.413
Why don't you come with me?

1869
02:43:59.372 --> 02:44:00.874
Get into some trouble.

1870
02:44:01.624 --> 02:44:05.128
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1871
02:44:05.795 --> 02:44:07.422
The bat and the cat.

1872
02:44:08.923 --> 02:44:10.592
It's got a nice ring.

1873
02:44:23.938 --> 02:44:25.356
Who am I kidding?

1874
02:44:26.816 --> 02:44:28.943
You're already spoken for.

1875
02:44:40.830 --> 02:44:42.248
You should go.

1876
02:44:50.590 --> 02:44:51.591
Selina...

1877
02:44:55.678 --> 02:44:57.347
Take care of yourself.
