00:50:44.685 --> 00:50:45.769
Hey.

712
00:50:46.937 --> 00:50:50.107
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

713
00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.609
How you been?

714
00:50:54.945 --> 00:50:56.655
Yeah, I've been okay.

716
00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.245
I was just headed back upstairs.

717
00:51:03.996 --> 00:51:04.997
Well...

719
00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:24.224
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

720
00:51:24.308 --> 00:51:25.952
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

a relationship with him, okay?</i>

722
00:51:27.853 --> 00:51:29.747

[Batman] What do you know about

758
00:54:39.503 --> 00:54:41.797
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

759
00:54:44.883 --> 00:54:46.593
Yeah, sure, there was.

760
00:54:47.302 --> 00:54:49.137
That's the rat we're looking for.

761
00:54:50.055 --> 00:54:51.932
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

762
00:54:52.516 --> 00:54:55.519
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

763
00:54:55.602 --> 00:54:57.062
Where are you getting this?

764
00:54:57.145 --> 00:55:00.023
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

765
00:55:00.816 --> 00:55:02.276
Gil's very nervous.

766
00:55:03.235 --> 00:55:05.779
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

767
00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:07.739
I worked that case.

768
00:55:07.823 --> 00:55:09.783
Riddler's not after you.

769
00:55:09.866 --> 00:55:10.866
How do you know?

770
00:55:11.158 --> 00:55:12.577
You're not corrupt.

771
00:55:13.619 --> 00:55:15.162
Colson's dirty?

772
00:55:21.043 --> 00:55:22.545
Maybe I, uh...

773
00:55:23.212 --> 00:55:26.549
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

774
00:55:26.632 --> 00:55:29.927
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

775
00:55:30.678 --> 00:55:32.471
Who knows how many people it touches.

776
00:55:32.555 --> 00:55:35.766
Politicians. Police. The courts.

777
00:55:37.059 --> 00:55:38.769
It could tear the whole city apart.

778
00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:41.230
[Gordon] Jesus, this is a powder keg.

779
00:55:42.857 --> 00:55:44.609

She a new friend of yours?

794

I'm not so sure.

795
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:15.681
Looks like you upset her.

Shall I take this as a good sign?

797
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.061
What?

798
00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:21.062
Your attire.

799
00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:23.272
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

800
00:56:23.356 --> 00:56:25.358
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

801
00:56:25.441 --> 00:56:28.110
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

802
00:56:29.153 --> 00:56:30.738
Riddler might not be able to resist.

803
00:56:30.821 --> 00:56:32.281
Oh, that reminds me.

804
00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:37.411
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

805
00:56:37.954 --> 00:56:39.455
The one from the rat maze.

806
00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:42.959
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

807
00:56:43.292 --> 00:56:45.169
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

808
00:56:45.253 --> 00:56:48.506
"You are <i>El Rata A lad a."</i>

809
00:56:49.131 --> 00:56:50.550
[Bruce] <i>Rata A lad a?</i>

810

"Rat with wings"?

811
00:56:51.926 --> 00:56:54.428
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

812
00:56:54.512 --> 00:56:55.763
Yeah.

813
00:56:57.223 --> 00:56:58.349
A stool pigeon.

815
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:01.309
I couldn't find them.

Well, you can't go out like that.

817

Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

would you, slick?

You got the prince of the city there.

842
00:59:16.612 --> 00:59:19.574
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

844

Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

845
00:59:23.911 --> 00:59:25.913
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

846
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:28.207
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

847
00:59:28.833 --> 00:59:30.293
Wow. Is that right?

848
00:59:30.376 --> 00:59:32.420
His father saved my life.

849
00:59:33.379 --> 00:59:36.591
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

850
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:41.304
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

Operated right on the dining room table.

Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

I remember your face.

854
00:59:55.567 --> 00:59:57.527
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

855
00:59:57.903 --> 01:00:00.030
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

856
01:00:01.364 --> 01:00:02.949
"Hippocratic oath."

857
01:00:05.493 --> 01:00:06.703
That's good.

you're unavailable.

You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

891
01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:31.872
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

892
01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:34.374
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

893
01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.918
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

904

He hasn't been heard from

to his house. Nothing.

909

[Mackenzie] What'd his wife say?

910

what he said, he'd kill me.

I'm so sorry.

Can't we just cut it off?

- "Justice."
- Huh?

1009

The answer's "justice."

- [raises voice] How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

- [Batman] The rat.

I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

I have family, people I love.

- Who will?

Who do you think he is under there?

1058
01:10:35.288 --> 01:10:36.122
[Gordon] Take it easy.

1059
01:10:36.206 --> 01:10:37.207
[Martinez] I want to see.

1060
01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:39.981
[medic] What is that thing? Leather?

1061
01:10:43.504 --> 01:10:44.964
[medic 2] What's he got on his eyes?

1062
01:10:45.048 --> 01:10:46.567
[Martinez] Who cares?
I want to see his face.

1063
01:10:46.591 --> 01:10:47.860
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

1064
01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:49.364
- [Gordon] Hey!
- [officers clamoring]

1065
01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:52.764
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1066
01:10:52.847 --> 01:10:54.515
Relax, God damn it!

1067
01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:56.100
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

1068
01:10:57.518 --> 01:11:00.063
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

1069
01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:02.565
Colson's blood is on his hands.

1070
01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.067
Maybe it's on yours.

1071
01:11:05.526 --> 01:11:06.569
What'd you say?

1072
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.238
He would rather die than talk.

1073
01:11:08.821 --> 01:11:10.323
What was he afraid of?

1074
01:11:11.074 --> 01:11:12.158
You?

1075

[menacing music playing]

1076
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:20.708
You son of a bitch.

1077
01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:24.295
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

1078
01:11:24.379 --> 01:11:26.089
You could be an accessory to murder.

1079
01:11:26.172 --> 01:11:27.274
[officer] Why are we playing games...

1080
01:11:27.298 --> 01:11:28.967
[officers clamoring]

1081
01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.176
[Officer 2] Get him! Come on!

1082
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.262
Back off! Back off!

1083
01:11:32.345 --> 01:11:34.639
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

1084
01:11:34.722 --> 01:11:36.808
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

1085
01:11:36.891 --> 01:11:39.686
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

1086
01:11:40.061 --> 01:11:41.813
[breathing heavily]

1087
01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:43.898
You too now?

1088
01:11:43.982 --> 01:11:46.526
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

1089
01:11:46.609 --> 01:11:49.195
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

1090
01:11:49.279 --> 01:11:51.531
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

1091
01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:55.827
Okay, give him the room.

1092
01:12:11.467 --> 01:12:12.760
Two minutes.

1093
01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:26.107
You listen to me.

1094
01:12:27.692 --> 01:12:29.694
[softly] We gotta get you out of here.

1095
01:12:31.362 --> 01:12:33.323
That would put a lot of heat on you.

1096
01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:35.074
Well, you punched me in the face.

1097
01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:37.243
[Batman scoffs]

1098
01:12:37.327 --> 01:12:38.620
Take this key.

1099
01:12:39.913 --> 01:12:43.291
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

1100
01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:46.094
[Kenzie] Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

1101
01:12:47.045 --> 01:12:49.339
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

[suspenseful music playing]

1103
01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:55.094
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

1104
01:12:58.514 --> 01:13:01.226
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

1105
01:13:01.309 --> 01:13:04.229
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

1106
01:13:05.146 --> 01:13:07.774
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

1107
01:13:10.485 --> 01:13:12.445
Or he moonlights as a cop.

1108
01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:18.593
- [officer] Jesus Christ!
- [Kenzie] Go!

1109
01:13:18.618 --> 01:13:20.119
[officer 2] Somebody stop him!

1110

[Gordon] Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

1119
01:14:48.707 --> 01:14:49.917
I did.

1120
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.378
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

1121
01:14:53.462 --> 01:14:55.505
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

1122
01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:56.715
I only trust you.

1123
01:14:56.798 --> 01:14:59.134
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

1124
01:14:59.218 --> 01:15:02.596
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

1125
01:15:03.347 --> 01:15:04.473
You think Penguin's the rat?

1126
01:15:04.556 --> 01:15:07.601
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

1127
01:15:07.684 --> 01:15:09.645
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

1128
01:15:09.728 --> 01:15:11.063
DA was a regular too.

1129
01:15:11.146 --> 01:15:14.650
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

1130
01:15:15.734 --> 01:15:16.944
The <i>Rata A lad a.</i>

1131

1132
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:19.529
Riddler's latest.

1133
01:15:19.613 --> 01:15:21.323
The cipher in the maze.

1134
01:15:21.406 --> 01:15:23.909
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

1135
01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:27.120
A penguin's got wings too.

1136
01:15:29.122 --> 01:15:31.083
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

1137
01:15:31.166 --> 01:15:32.894
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

1138
01:15:32.918 --> 01:15:36.129
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

1139
01:15:36.213 --> 01:15:39.383
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

- [man] Yeah, good. How are you?

1151
01:16:20.883 --> 01:16:23.385
[Penguin] Good, good.

It's a drug lab. Drops.

This is a buy.

1156
01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:49.703
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

1157
01:16:49.786 --> 01:16:51.014
Or they never shut it down at all.

1158

[Gordon] <i>What are you saying?</i>

1159
01:16:51.997 --> 01:16:55.125

- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1422

Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1423

She didn't know any better.

1424

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1426
01:36:56.322 --> 01:36:57.883
It means your choices have consequences.

1428
01:37:00.368 --> 01:37:03.079
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

- What?

1430

Compromising yourself for money?

You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1434
01:37:17.926 --> 01:37:19.261
Falcone owes me that money.

- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1436

Oh, really? Why's that?

1437

You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1438
01:37:23.098 --> 01:37:24.850
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1439
01:37:24.933 --> 01:37:25.934
would owe you anything.

1440
01:37:26.018 --> 01:37:28.353

Because he's my father!

My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1442
01:37:41.783 --> 01:37:43.076
Just like Anni.

1443
01:37:45.245 --> 01:37:47.789
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1444
01:37:49.875 --> 01:37:51.210
To the club?

1445
01:37:52.127 --> 01:37:53.128
Yeah.

1446
01:37:55.839 --> 01:37:58.717
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1447
01:37:59.176 --> 01:38:00.928
Used to see him there.

1448
01:38:01.678 --> 01:38:03.680
He scared the shit out of me.

1449
01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:09.102
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1450
01:38:09.645 --> 01:38:13.482
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1451
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:19.196
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1452
01:38:19.863 --> 01:38:21.365
Strangled.

1453
01:38:21.782 --> 01:38:25.244
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1454
01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.206
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1455
01:38:29.289 --> 01:38:31.458
and he didn't say a thing.

1456
01:38:33.293 --> 01:38:35.087
Couldn't even look at me.

1457
01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:40.592
He owes me that money.

1458
01:38:42.386 --> 01:38:43.804
I'm sorry.

1459
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:46.098
For what I said.

1460

to go after these creeps.

01:45:18.948 --> 01:45:21.325
what even a good man like him

1578
01:45:21.409 --> 01:45:23.995
is capable of in the right situation.

1579
01:45:26.247 --> 01:45:27.707
Do me a favor.

1580
01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.084
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1581
01:45:30.793 --> 01:45:32.378
This reporter

1582
01:45:33.212 --> 01:45:34.797
was a lowlife.

1583
01:45:34.881 --> 01:45:36.340
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1584
01:45:37.967 --> 01:45:39.594
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1585
01:45:40.344 --> 01:45:43.598
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1586
01:45:45.016 --> 01:45:48.519
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1587
01:45:48.603 --> 01:45:50.938
that your father would be in my pocket,

1588
01:45:51.689 --> 01:45:52.690
forever.

1589
01:45:53.357 --> 01:45:55.401
He would have done anything

1590
01:45:55.484 --> 01:45:57.653
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1591
01:45:57.737 --> 01:45:59.071
You understand?

1592
01:46:00.281 --> 01:46:04.827
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1593
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:06.954
Do I know it for a fact?

1594
01:46:09.373 --> 01:46:11.459
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1595
01:46:12.835 --> 01:46:15.129
This is what you wanted, huh?

1596
01:46:15.213 --> 01:46:17.632
This little conversation here?

1597
01:46:18.132 --> 01:46:19.550
[exhales ruefully]

1598
01:46:20.051 --> 01:46:22.220
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1599
01:46:24.847 --> 01:46:26.974
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1600
01:46:30.436 --> 01:46:32.521
[melancholy music playing]

1601
01:47:16.648 --> 01:47:18.608
[EKG machine beeping]

1602
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:23.738
[inhales sharply]

1603
01:47:28.994 --> 01:47:30.745
[rain pattering]

1604
01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:34.624
[sighs]

1605
01:47:36.376 --> 01:47:37.669
You lied to me...

1606
01:47:40.505 --> 01:47:42.132
my whole life.

1607
01:47:47.304 --> 01:47:49.347
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1608
01:47:52.434 --> 01:47:55.729
He told me what he did for my father.

1609
01:47:59.733 --> 01:48:01.234
About Salvatore Maroni.

1610
01:48:03.236 --> 01:48:05.947
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1611
01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:07.782
Had my father killed.

1612
01:48:10.243 --> 01:48:12.454
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1613
01:48:15.207 --> 01:48:19.753
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1614
01:48:19.836 --> 01:48:22.172
believing that he was a good man.

1615
01:48:22.255 --> 01:48:23.840
He was a good man.

1616
01:48:25.008 --> 01:48:26.718
You listen to me.

1617
01:48:26.801 --> 01:48:30.222
Your father was a good man.

1618
01:48:33.850 --> 01:48:35.769
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1619
01:48:35.852 --> 01:48:37.771
He had a man killed.

1620
01:48:37.854 --> 01:48:38.939
Why?

1621
01:48:40.106 --> 01:48:43.360
[sighing] To protect his family image?

1622
01:48:44.444 --> 01:48:45.695
His political aspirations?

1623
01:48:45.779 --> 01:48:49.324
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1624
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:53.453
He was protecting your mother.

1625
01:48:54.412 --> 01:48:57.958
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1626
01:48:58.041 --> 01:49:00.168
He cared about her,

1627
01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:01.545
and you,

1628
01:49:01.628 --> 01:49:04.548
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1629
01:49:04.631 --> 01:49:08.093
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1630
01:49:08.969 --> 01:49:12.305
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1631
01:49:12.389 --> 01:49:15.517
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1632
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.435
That's who Falcone is.

1633
01:49:19.688 --> 01:49:21.898
And that was your father's mistake.

1634
01:49:21.982 --> 01:49:24.025
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1635
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:26.862
your father was distraught.

1636
01:49:27.737 --> 01:49:30.949
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1637
01:49:31.032 --> 01:49:33.201
that he would confess everything.

1638
01:49:34.703 --> 01:49:36.705
And that night,

1639
01:49:36.788 --> 01:49:40.709
your father and your mother were killed.

1640
01:49:43.128 --> 01:49:45.297
[soft music playing]

1641
01:49:46.214 --> 01:49:47.966
It was Falcone?

1642
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:53.930
[smacks lips]

1643
01:49:54.014 --> 01:49:56.141
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1644
01:50:00.854 --> 01:50:04.399
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1645
01:50:04.482 --> 01:50:07.235
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1646
01:50:07.319 --> 01:50:12.532
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1647
01:50:14.284 --> 01:50:18.163
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1648
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:20.624
I know you always blamed yourself.

1649
01:50:20.707 --> 01:50:23.251
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1650
01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.714
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1651
01:50:29.132 --> 01:50:31.509
but I didn't know how to help.

1652
01:50:31.593 --> 01:50:34.095
I could teach you how to fight, [sighs]

1653
01:50:35.472 --> 01:50:38.141
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1654
01:50:38.225 --> 01:50:40.060
You needed a father.

1655
01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:44.439
And all you had was me.

1656
01:50:46.816 --> 01:50:48.026
I'm sorry.

1657
01:50:49.778 --> 01:50:51.696
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1658
01:50:58.495 --> 01:50:59.579
God.

1659
01:51:02.624 --> 01:51:07.045
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1660
01:51:09.756 --> 01:51:11.883
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1661
01:51:18.305 --> 01:51:19.557
I mean,

1662
01:51:20.766 --> 01:51:22.893
I'm not afraid to die.

1663
01:51:24.645 --> 01:51:27.022
I realize now there's something

1664
01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:30.025
I haven't got past.

1665
01:51:30.943 --> 01:51:32.695
This fear...

1666
01:51:35.155 --> 01:51:38.117
of ever going through any of that again.

1667
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:44.582
Of losing somebody I care about.

1668
01:51:45.916 --> 01:51:48.210
[soft music continues]

1669
01:52:12.526 --> 01:52:14.236
[soft dramatic music playing]

1670
01:52:17.239 --> 01:52:18.908
[engine revving]

1671
01:52:35.174 --> 01:52:36.174
Hey.

1672
01:52:36.217 --> 01:52:38.969
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1673
01:52:39.053 --> 01:52:40.971
I thought it was you.

1674
01:52:45.142 --> 01:52:46.518
[both grunting]

1675
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:55.444
- I found him!
- I see that.

1676
01:52:55.528 --> 01:52:57.029
He had my shit and my phone.

1677
01:52:57.112 --> 01:52:58.381
She left a message
the night they took her.

1678
01:52:58.405 --> 01:52:59.323
She called me...

1679
01:52:59.406 --> 01:53:01.116
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1680
01:53:01.200 --> 01:53:02.493
She got my gun!

1681
01:53:02.743 --> 01:53:03.744
[grunts]

1682
01:53:03.827 --> 01:53:05.538
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1683
01:53:07.081 --> 01:53:09.625
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1684
01:53:14.213 --> 01:53:16.298
- [cell phone beeps]
- Here. Listen.

1685
01:53:18.259 --> 01:53:19.927
[Kenzie on recording]
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1686
01:53:20.052 --> 01:53:22.252
- [Annika whimpering]
- <i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

1687
01:53:22.304 --> 01:53:24.390
[Falcone] <i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

1688
01:53:24.473 --> 01:53:25.808
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1689
01:53:25.891 --> 01:53:27.601
[Kenzie] <i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1690
01:53:27.685 --> 01:53:28.787
[Annika, tearfully]
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1691
01:53:28.811 --> 01:53:30.104
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1692
01:53:30.187 --> 01:53:32.857
[Falcone]
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

1693
01:53:34.733 --> 01:53:36.777
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1694
01:53:37.486 --> 01:53:40.030
<i>- What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- [Annika] <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

1695
01:53:40.114 --> 01:53:43.033
[Falcone] <i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

1696
01:53:43.117 --> 01:53:45.828
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1697
01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:48.372
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

1698
01:53:49.081 --> 01:53:51.959
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

1699
01:53:52.042 --> 01:53:54.753
[Annika] <i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

1700
01:53:54.837 --> 01:53:57.023
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

1701
01:53:57.047 --> 01:54:00.175
[Falcone] <i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

1702
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:03.554
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1703
01:54:04.638 --> 01:54:05.973
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1704
01:54:06.765 --> 01:54:10.311
[Annika] <i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

1705
01:54:10.811 --> 01:54:12.021
[Falcone] <i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1706
01:54:12.104 --> 01:54:14.064
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1707
01:54:14.148 --> 01:54:15.441
<i>The deal.</i>

1708
01:54:15.524 --> 01:54:20.446
[Annika] <i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

1709
01:54:20.529 --> 01:54:23.240
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1710
01:54:23.324 --> 01:54:25.701
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1711
01:54:25.784 --> 01:54:26.911
[Falcone] <i>Right.</i>

1712
01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:29.038
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1713
01:54:29.997 --> 01:54:32.166
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1714
01:54:34.251 --> 01:54:36.003
- [tussling on recording]
- [Annika screams]

1715
01:54:36.962 --> 01:54:38.482
- [Annika cries]
- [tussling continues]

1716
01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:41.234
- [Falcone] <i>Just take it easy.</i>
- [Annika choking]

1717
01:54:41.258 --> 01:54:42.801
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1718
01:54:42.885 --> 01:54:45.930
[Falcone] <i>Take it easy.</i>

1719
01:54:48.057 --> 01:54:49.475
[recording stops]

1720
01:54:55.147 --> 01:54:56.440
<i>Rata A lad a.</i>

1721
01:55:01.195 --> 01:55:02.988
A falcon has wings too.

1722
01:55:03.322 --> 01:55:05.157
Falcone is the rat?

1723
01:55:16.126 --> 01:55:19.296
Falcone works for you guys?

1724
01:55:19.964 --> 01:55:22.508
The mayor? The DA?

1725
01:55:25.511 --> 01:55:26.595
No.

1726
01:55:26.929 --> 01:55:28.430
[breathing shakily]

1727
01:55:29.682 --> 01:55:30.975
We work for him.

1728
01:55:31.976 --> 01:55:33.227
Everybody does.

1729
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:34.311
How?

1730
01:55:34.395 --> 01:55:35.980
Through Renewal.

1731
01:55:36.772 --> 01:55:38.148
Renewal is everything.

1732
01:55:38.232 --> 01:55:39.632
- The Renewal Fund?
- [Kenzie] Yeah.

1733
01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:43.863
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1734
01:55:43.946 --> 01:55:47.533
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1735
01:55:47.616 --> 01:55:50.995
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1736
01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:53.163
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1737
01:55:53.247 --> 01:55:54.956
Everybody got a piece.

1738
01:55:55.039 --> 01:55:56.875
But Falcone wanted more.

1739
01:55:58.668 --> 01:56:01.880
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1740
01:56:03.298 --> 01:56:05.633
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1741
01:56:06.009 --> 01:56:08.720
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1742
01:56:08.803 --> 01:56:11.264
then install them all as his puppets.

1743
01:56:11.347 --> 01:56:13.892
You think this goddamn election matters?

1744
01:56:15.518 --> 01:56:17.437
Falcone's the mayor.

1745
01:56:18.396 --> 01:56:20.899
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1746
01:56:20.982 --> 01:56:22.358
Come on, Vengeance.

1747
01:56:23.067 --> 01:56:24.903
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1748
01:56:25.612 --> 01:56:27.298
- This creep too. Let's finish this.

- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1753

He owns the city!

1754

She won't get out of there alive.

we may never find the Riddler.

1764
01:57:12.617 --> 01:57:13.618
I have to stop her.

1765

I'd like to come up?

He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1774

that you're a very important man.

1788

I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1797
01:59:20.537 --> 01:59:23.456
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

[stool creaking]

1926
02:08:45.683 --> 02:08:47.602
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1927
02:08:50.563 --> 02:08:51.856
[Martinez] Stay still!

1928
02:08:51.939 --> 02:08:52.940
Now!

[tense music continues]

1931
02:09:21.594 --> 02:09:23.387
[Martinez] Which one is you?

1932
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:24.972
[laughs gleefully] You tell me.

1933
02:09:25.806 --> 02:09:27.266
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1934
02:09:30.353 --> 02:09:32.104
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1935

[eerie music playing]

1936
02:09:40.696 --> 02:09:42.198
[siren wailing in distance]

1937

Hey.

02:09:59.130 --> 02:10:00.674
[suspenseful music playing]

1942
02:10:20.443 --> 02:10:22.153
What are all these diaries?

1943
02:10:22.237 --> 02:10:24.656
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1944
02:10:24.739 --> 02:10:28.285
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1945
02:10:28.368 --> 02:10:29.911
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1946
02:10:29.995 --> 02:10:32.289
Edward Nash ton. Works at KTMJ.

1947
02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:34.207
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1948
02:10:34.291 --> 02:10:36.710
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1949
02:10:36.793 --> 02:10:38.545
What about chain of evidence?

1950
02:10:39.379 --> 02:10:40.589
You should see this.

1951
02:10:46.553 --> 02:10:48.054
He's wearing gloves.

1952
02:10:49.514 --> 02:10:51.766
"Friday, July 16th.

1953
02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:55.562
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1954
02:10:55.896 --> 02:10:58.940
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1955
02:10:59.024 --> 02:11:00.442
But then, today, I saw it.

1956
02:11:00.525 --> 02:11:04.654
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1957
02:11:05.989 --> 02:11:07.782
'Renewal.'

1958
02:11:07.866 --> 02:11:12.287
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1959
02:11:12.370 --> 02:11:15.498
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1960
02:11:15.582 --> 02:11:18.919
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1961
02:11:19.002 --> 02:11:21.463
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1962
02:11:21.546 --> 02:11:24.549
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1963

- [rats squeaking]
- "If you want people to understand,

you can't just give them the answers.

1966
02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:33.350
You have to confront them,

1967
02:11:33.433 --> 02:11:35.852
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1968
02:11:35.936 --> 02:11:38.104
just like they tortured me.

1969
02:11:38.188 --> 02:11:40.982
I know now what I must become."

I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1973
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:55.372
This one's not a rat.

1974

- [rat continues squeaking]
- [cages rattling]

1975

[screeching violently]

1976
02:12:12.013 --> 02:12:13.139
[Gordon] What is that?

1977
02:12:15.850 --> 02:12:17.352
[bat screeching frantically]

1978
02:12:44.754 --> 02:12:46.023
[officer] Some kind of pry tool?

1979
02:12:46.047 --> 02:12:47.424
Is it a chisel?

1980
02:12:47.507 --> 02:12:48.967
[Batman] It's a murder weapon.

1981
02:12:49.050 --> 02:12:50.427
He killed Mitchell with it.

1982
02:12:51.094 --> 02:12:53.972
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1983
02:13:02.564 --> 02:13:04.566
"My confession"?

1984
02:13:04.649 --> 02:13:07.527
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1985
02:13:07.611 --> 02:13:08.987
This isn't over.

1986
02:13:09.070 --> 02:13:11.590
[officer 2] Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1987
02:13:11.907 --> 02:13:14.117
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1988
02:13:14.492 --> 02:13:15.785
[typing]

1989
02:13:22.209 --> 02:13:24.419
His final post was last night.

1990
02:13:24.502 --> 02:13:27.714
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1991
02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:30.800
- [Gordon] Can you get in?
- [officer 2] Copying his drive now.

1992
02:13:30.926 --> 02:13:34.346
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1993
02:13:34.846 --> 02:13:36.431
[ominous music playing]

1994
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:48.235
- [Gordon] Show me the post.
- [officer 2] It's right here.

1995
02:13:49.861 --> 02:13:51.571
[Gordon] "The Truth Unmasked."

1996
02:13:52.405 --> 02:13:54.032
I think I'm his last target.

1997
02:13:56.618 --> 02:13:57.702
You?

1998
02:13:58.078 --> 02:14:00.121
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1999
02:14:00.664 --> 02:14:02.040
What is?

2000
02:14:02.499 --> 02:14:03.917
The Batman.

2001
02:14:04.167 --> 02:14:05.335
[cell phone ringing]

2002
02:14:09.297 --> 02:14:10.465
Yeah?

2003
02:14:21.768 --> 02:14:22.978
Right.

2004
02:14:25.856 --> 02:14:29.818
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

2005
02:14:37.283 --> 02:14:38.784
You're a good cop.

2006
02:15:03.392 --> 02:15:05.769
[over speaker]
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

2007

[Batman] <i>What do you want from me?</i>

2008
02:15:08.439 --> 02:15:09.982
[Riddler] "Want"?

2009
02:15:10.566 --> 02:15:14.195
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

2010
02:15:15.404 --> 02:15:16.739
<i>For this moment.</i>

2011
02:15:17.781 --> 02:15:20.784
I've been invisible my whole life.

2012
02:15:21.869 --> 02:15:24.496
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

2013
02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:28.459
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

2014
02:15:28.542 --> 02:15:30.377
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

[exhales deeply]

2020
02:16:09.124 --> 02:16:11.544
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

2021
02:16:14.129 --> 02:16:17.508
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

2022
02:16:17.591 --> 02:16:19.969
<i>made all those promises.</i>

2023
02:16:22.429 --> 02:16:26.684
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

2024
02:16:27.226 --> 02:16:30.771
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

2025
02:16:30.855 --> 02:16:34.525
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

2026
02:16:35.109 --> 02:16:36.652
<i>Orphan.</i>

2027
02:16:42.324 --> 02:16:47.454
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

2028

<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

2029
02:16:54.044 --> 02:16:55.588
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

2030
02:16:58.215 --> 02:17:00.885
Do you know what being an orphan is?

2031
02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:03.846
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

2032
02:17:05.139 --> 02:17:09.185
<i>Twelve years old and already a drop head,
numbing the pain.</i>

2033
02:17:10.895 --> 02:17:15.566
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

2034
02:17:16.734 --> 02:17:19.904
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

2035
02:17:19.987 --> 02:17:22.281
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

2036
02:17:23.574 --> 02:17:26.160
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

2037
02:17:27.453 --> 02:17:28.704
[smacks lips]

2038

<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

2039
02:17:32.333 --> 02:17:35.252
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

2040
02:17:35.336 --> 02:17:36.337
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

2041
02:17:37.796 --> 02:17:39.840
<i>Bruce...</i>

2042
02:17:40.883 --> 02:17:42.801
<i>Wayne.</i>

2043
02:17:46.472 --> 02:17:49.558
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

2044
02:17:52.978 --> 02:17:56.106
<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

2045
02:17:57.566 --> 02:18:01.445
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

<i>God.</i>

2047
02:18:06.784 --> 02:18:08.077
<i>Look at you.</i>

2048
02:18:09.745 --> 02:18:12.206
Your mask is amazing.

2049
02:18:12.289 --> 02:18:15.209
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

2050
02:18:15.292 --> 02:18:16.377
Ain't it funny?

2051
02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:20.881
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

2052

<i>You and I both know</i>

2053
02:18:25.344 --> 02:18:27.846
I'm looking at the real you right now.

2054
02:18:27.930 --> 02:18:31.559
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

2055
02:18:31.642 --> 02:18:33.185
<i>No shame,</i>

2056
02:18:34.103 --> 02:18:35.104
<i>no limits.</i>

2057
02:18:35.187 --> 02:18:36.856
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

2058
02:18:37.731 --> 02:18:38.732
<i>What do you mean?</i>

2059
02:18:38.816 --> 02:18:40.526
<i>All those cards.</i>

2060
02:18:40.609 --> 02:18:41.819
<i>I told you,</i>

2061
02:18:42.528 --> 02:18:44.506
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

2062
02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:46.740
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

2063
02:18:46.824 --> 02:18:48.284
<i>What did we just do?</i>

2064
02:18:48.367 --> 02:18:50.428
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

2065
02:18:50.452 --> 02:18:51.620
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

2066
02:18:51.704 --> 02:18:52.705
<i>We're not a team.</i>

2067
02:18:52.788 --> 02:18:55.291
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

2068
02:18:55.374 --> 02:18:57.793
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

2069
02:18:57.877 --> 02:19:01.046
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

2070
02:19:01.130 --> 02:19:02.770
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

2071
02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.049
You gave me that.

2072
02:19:04.133 --> 02:19:05.259
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

2073
02:19:05.342 --> 02:19:07.928
You showed me what was possible.

2074
02:19:08.012 --> 02:19:12.892
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

2075
02:19:12.975 --> 02:19:14.518
<i>You inspired me.</i>

2076
02:19:14.602 --> 02:19:16.102
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

2077
02:19:17.228 --> 02:19:18.313
<i>What?</i>

2078
02:19:18.396 --> 02:19:20.565
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

2079
02:19:20.648 --> 02:19:22.025
<i>How can you say that?</i>

2080
02:19:22.108 --> 02:19:23.610
You think you'll be remembered?

2081
02:19:23.693 --> 02:19:25.361
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

2082
02:19:25.862 --> 02:19:27.614
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

2083
02:19:27.697 --> 02:19:29.365
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

2084
02:19:29.449 --> 02:19:30.491
<i>No, no!</i>

2085
02:19:30.575 --> 02:19:31.575
<i>A nobody!</i>

2086
02:19:33.286 --> 02:19:35.079
<i>No!</i>

2087
02:19:36.998 --> 02:19:39.375
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2088
02:19:39.626 --> 02:19:42.212
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

2089
02:19:43.171 --> 02:19:46.799
<i>Ahhh!</i>

2090
02:19:46.883 --> 02:19:49.510
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

2091
02:19:50.511 --> 02:19:52.513
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

2092
02:19:52.889 --> 02:19:56.184
We could watch the whole thing together.

2093
02:19:56.267 --> 02:19:57.268
<i>Watch what?</i>

2094
02:19:57.352 --> 02:19:59.103
