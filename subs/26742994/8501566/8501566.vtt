1
00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:25.205
- Blood, not blood in
the physical sense.

2
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.976
I'm talking about
blood as in kinfolk,

3
00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:32.312
your own kind, your own people,

4
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.515
who you are, what you are.

5
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:38.653
I think that's important.

6
00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.558
You look at the world today,

7
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.460
you points your finger
anywhere on a map

8
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.862
where there's trouble.

9
00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:51.498
And soon see that that
trouble is caused by people

10
00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.768
being where they
ain't supposed to be.

11
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.605
Been that way, since
Moses walked the earth

12
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:03.511
and Jew boys and camel jockeys
at each other's throats,

13
00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.012
and they're still at it.

14
00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.248
Same story all through history.

15
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.819
People don't mix.

16
00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:16.323
Races, creeds, colors, whatever.

17
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:22.395
The so-called great melting pot.

18
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.665
I call it a great pot of shit.

19
00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.635
It's like oil and water.

20
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.605
And if folks don't
wake up to that soon,

21
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:33.406
mankind gonna end up
being a breed of Mongols.

22
00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:41.916
You, my friend, are very
resourceful, very industrious.

23
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.656
I see you in them fields
working morning until night.

24
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.492
Some of the lazy bastards
around here should take note.

25
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.632
But it ain't about that is it?

26
00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:02.970
It's about blood and you
just ain't our blood.

27
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:11.478
What I'm saying
is pretty simple.

28
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.915
Wouldn't the world be
a much better place

29
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.583
if people just stayed
where they were

30
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.417
and looked after their own?

31
00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.925
- Mr. Reynolds, I
came here tonight-

32
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.425
- You came here tonight

33
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.063
because you're a peace
loving reasonable man,

34
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:34.434
but we ain't peace
loving reasonable people.

35
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:39.974
- This is a new deed for the
land you're squatting on.

36
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.844
And this is a pen.

37
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.612
Sure being the smart
Chinaman you are,

38
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.115
you can work out
what that means.

39
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.917
- The bank says, as long
as I make the payments-

40
00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:52.153
- Don't matter
what the bank says.

41
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.956
What matters is that your
family will be a whole lot safer

42
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.123
after you sign that.

43
00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:00.061
- Gentlemen, please.

44
00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:03.631
I think this is best
left for another time.

45
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.100
Goodnight.

46
00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.372
- Don't turn your
fucking back on me!

47
00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.918
- He's still breathing.

48
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.990
- No he ain't!

49
00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:44.432
- Good afternoon.

50
00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:47.101
I'm Danny G and this is
your local radio news.

51
00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:48.803
Our top story today,

52
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.471
a series of gruesome and
unexplained animal deaths

53
00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.307
has shaken the community here.

54
00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:54.742
Over the past several weeks,

55
00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.644
a growing number
of local residents

56
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.347
have reported discovering
the lifeless bodies

57
00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.082
of various animals.

58
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.719
The mention of Red Coat has
been circulating among locals,

59
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.121
sparking fear and speculation.

60
00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:11.125
Red Coat is a figure from
urban legends in the area.

61
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.337
The fact that they persist,
is causing growing...

62
00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:24.605
Understandably the community is-

63
00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.374
- Hey!
- Alarmed by the.

64
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.217
- Rachel's off limits.

65
00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:40.087
And I see you
looking at her again,

66
00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:43.057
we're gonna have problems.

67
00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.527
- What happened?

68
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:53.727
- Nothing.

69
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.263
- Edward.

70
00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:22.577
- Come on man.

71
00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:25.112
Just hold it steady.

72
00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:26.113
Hurry up.

73
00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:28.249
Hurry up, man.

74
00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:31.653
- Fuck.

75
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.820
- Come on, fucking
light it, Dee.

76
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.221
- I'm trying.

77
00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:37.692
Oh shit.

78
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:38.892
Go, go.

79
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.095
- Who's there?

80
00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.266
Sammy, shh.

81
00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.310
Ed.

82
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.402
Come out.

83
00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:28.309
I said come out.

84
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:08.849
Help me get his coat off.

85
00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:15.155
Lift him up.

86
00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:17.257
Come on, one, two, three.

87
00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:24.932
He's fine.

88
00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.001
He's fine, okay?

89
00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:30.304
Okay, fine.

90
00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:40.948
- Why did we bring him here?

91
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.983
I mean, what if
he's the Red Coat

92
00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.386
or one of Reynolds's
buddies, or...

93
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.458
We can't call the police.

94
00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:54.228
So what do we do, Mom?

95
00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:58.232
Mom!

96
00:15:00.602 --> 00:15:02.837
You know, we can't trust
anyone around here.

97
00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:04.138
You know that.

98
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:11.646
- Let's keep him warm.

99
00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:13.046
Keep him comfortable.

100
00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:17.084
As soon as he's back on
his feet, we get him out.

101
00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:19.987
Okay?

102
00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:00.562
- Grab her feet!

103
00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.379
- Open please.

104
00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.017
Very good.

105
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.662
That's your medicine.

106
00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.096
Make sure you take it.

107
00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.465
And you're not
allowed out of bed.

108
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.536
- Emily, come here.

109
00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.805
- Mommy, you scared me.

110
00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:19.273
He's sick.

111
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.276
- I know, but remember
we said about strangers.

112
00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:24.177
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

113
00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.113
He opened his eyes.

114
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:28.282
- Okay.

115
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:29.416
Go play in your room.

116
00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.641
Emily. Ready?

117
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.211
Gonna be late for school.

118
00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:59.514
Come on, come on, come on.

119
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.515
Good girl.

120
00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:59.266
- I need blood.

121
00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:12.547
Give me blood.

122
00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:33.568
- Welcome to
Northwest Mystery,

123
00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:35.770
your source for
all things strange

124
00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:38.873
and enigmatic in the
Pacific Northwest.

125
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.340
I'm Scott.

126
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.043
And today we're diving
deep into the world

127
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.445
of urban myths and legends
that have long captivated

128
00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:48.850
the imagination of
this city creature.

129
00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:49.984
Well done, guys.

130
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:51.686
- Do you have any Tylenol?

131
00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.622
- I got Naproxen.

132
00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:57.558
That's the strongest
thing I carry.

133
00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:04.966
- You're not well, Mrs. Loi.

134
00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:08.202
I know a doctor
who can hook you up

135
00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.971
with some Oxy if you need.

136
00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:11.105
It's good stuff.

137
00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:13.007
Make all your troubles go away.

138
00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:14.942
How's it hanging fellas?

139
00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:15.943
- Ah.

140
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.714
- Throw some candy
in there too, Sam,

141
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.616
for the little girl.

142
00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:23.718
The boy too, if he likes.

143
00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:30.024
Haven't seen you around
the town much lately.

144
00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:33.728
Of course, I understand with
the everything going on.

145
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:35.797
The shame of it all.

146
00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:37.732
- Shame?

147
00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:42.036
- Your husband running
off on you like that.

148
00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:44.572
I hear it happens a
lot with you people.

149
00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:47.842
No real sense of
family or loyalty.

150
00:21:48.943 --> 00:21:51.478
Of course, saying
that, old Don here,

151
00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:54.048
when his wife got sick,

152
00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.316
he took comfort in the
arms of widow Anderson

153
00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:57.985
in the hills.

154
00:21:58.052 --> 00:21:59.921
To look at him, you wouldn't
think he had it in him,

155
00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.023
but he certainly had it
in her a few times a week.

156
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.093
Thankfully, all
that chasing around

157
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.896
after the widow stopped,
once Don's wife got better.

158
00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:12.365
What Don's wife don't
know won't hurt her.

159
00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:14.836
Ain't that right, Vinny?

160
00:22:16.003 --> 00:22:17.238
How's your nephew?

161
00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:18.739
You know Vinny's nephew?

162
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.108
He sells farm diesel.

163
00:22:22.543 --> 00:22:24.712
He gets it cheap on
account of his farm.

164
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.581
Then he went and
turned his tanker truck

165
00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.381
into a rolling gas station.

166
00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:30.718
Sells at a good prices
from what I hear.

167
00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:33.554
Man's gotta make a living.

168
00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:37.124
Let him without sin
cast the first stone.

169
00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:41.028
And of course there's
Sam, Mr. Johnson.

170
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.129
He used to like a game of cards.

171
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.496
- That's enough.

172
00:22:51.072 --> 00:22:54.175
- I'm just painting a picture
so the Asian understands.

173
00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:58.378
You see, Mrs. Loi, this town
is, it's like a spider's web.

174
00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:01.381
Everyone's lives
all intertwined.

175
00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:02.850
The threads are real strong.

176
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:04.886
I'm sure it's the same
in the, the village

177
00:23:04.952 --> 00:23:06.320
or whatever it
was you came from.

178
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.455
- I came from a city,

179
00:23:08.522 --> 00:23:10.658
- Well, a city.

180
00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:14.195
- A city with
museums and theaters

181
00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:16.564
and schools and universities.

182
00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:20.568
A city we chose to leave
behind and now I'm here.

183
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:23.638
- Yeah, you are alone.

184
00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:27.608
- You're pathetic.

185
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:30.745
I'm not scared of you.

186
00:23:36.751 --> 00:23:38.619
- They excitable them gooks.

187
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.729
You disrespect me
like that again,

188
00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:50.698
I'll cut your
fucking throat out.

189
00:24:20.928 --> 00:24:23.664
What the fuck happened
at the Chinaman's place?

190
00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:27.768
- The bottle slip, Joe.

191
00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:31.038
The fucking dog started
making all kinds of ruckus.

192
00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:32.039
- Dog, huh?

193
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.675
Sounds like a dangerous animal.

194
00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:38.012
Somebody ought to report
that to the police.

195
00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:44.218
- Hey, Rach.

196
00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.721
- What do you want?

197
00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:50.191
- What's your problem?
- Get your hands off of me.

198
00:24:56.964 --> 00:24:58.498
- I'm going to see
your grandmother.

199
00:24:58.566 --> 00:24:59.834
See how she's doing.

200
00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:10.144
You know, when I was your age,

201
00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:12.880
I was learning how to
handle a branding iron.

202
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.752
- What do you
mean, Mr. Reynolds?

203
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.655
- I mean the pain
of my burning flesh.

204
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:26.227
That's something no
one ever forgets.

205
00:26:07.301 --> 00:26:09.236
- Do not laugh at that.

206
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.438
Stay.

207
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:14.608
Make sure you take it.

208
00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:16.010
Here, better.

209
00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:38.732
You stink.

210
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.634
You need a bath.

211
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.269
- I do.
- Yeah.

212
00:26:43.737 --> 00:26:45.339
Hi, Edward.

213
00:26:46.874 --> 00:26:51.178
- The nurse here was just
making sure I'm okay.

214
00:26:55.282 --> 00:26:58.085
He's gonna go get me
something I need, okay?

215
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:02.990
I need you to get
me fresh blood.

216
00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:05.126
- What?

217
00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:09.130
- You heard me.

218
00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:11.132
- How?

219
00:27:13.434 --> 00:27:15.136
- This is a farm, isn't it?

220
00:27:15.202 --> 00:27:16.137
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.242
- So I guess you'll
figure it out.

222
00:27:23.844 --> 00:27:25.412
- Only if she comes with me.

223
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.783
- You wanna stay and
look after me, don't you?

224
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:30.784
- Sure thing.

225
00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:32.686
It's my vacation.

226
00:27:32.753 --> 00:27:34.321
- Vacation?

227
00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:37.057
- No, that isn't right.

228
00:27:37.124 --> 00:27:38.058
Vocation.

229
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:39.894
- Vocation.

230
00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:43.731
But why don't you
check me again?

231
00:27:44.465 --> 00:27:45.399
Ah.

232
00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:03.837
- Are you the Red Coat?

233
00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:03.364
- Ma.

234
00:31:18.045 --> 00:31:20.314
You making out okay, Ma?

235
00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:21.448
- Yeah.

236
00:31:23.585 --> 00:31:25.720
- Why don't you let me
move you to the house?

237
00:31:25.787 --> 00:31:30.190
- No, I made this
bar in my life.

238
00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:33.260
It's right I die here.

239
00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:39.233
- You're too stubborn to die.

240
00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:50.144
Ma, better tidy up for a little.

241
00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:54.081
Or you'll start looking like
one of them mountain women.

242
00:31:54.148 --> 00:31:56.083
We can't have that.

243
00:32:30.184 --> 00:32:31.586
- Leave me be.

244
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.540
- What do you want?

245
00:33:58.606 --> 00:34:00.340
- Your dog's
been killing sheep.

246
00:34:00.407 --> 00:34:01.776
- Sammy's been chained
up here all night.

247
00:34:01.843 --> 00:34:03.243
- I didn't come here
to fuss with you.

248
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:04.712
I'm gonna take care of the dog.

249
00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:05.880
- You're not taking our dog.

250
00:34:05.947 --> 00:34:07.247
- Get off our land.

251
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:09.817
- Your land.

252
00:34:09.884 --> 00:34:12.085
Your land at the other side
of the fucking world, boy.

253
00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.521
- Edward.
- What?

254
00:34:13.588 --> 00:34:15.790
You wanna take a
swing at me, huh?

255
00:34:15.857 --> 00:34:17.592
No, you some kind
of fucking pussy.

256
00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:18.826
You even like pussy boy?

257
00:34:18.893 --> 00:34:21.261
- I want you gone now.

258
00:34:21.328 --> 00:34:22.997
- Oh, I'm gonna be gone.

259
00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:25.132
I'm just taking
Fido there with me.

260
00:34:27.535 --> 00:34:29.537
- You got a warrant
for that dog?

261
00:34:30.705 --> 00:34:32.239
- Who the fuck are you?

262
00:34:33.206 --> 00:34:34.408
You some drifter?

263
00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:37.545
Oh, oh, oh.

264
00:34:37.612 --> 00:34:41.381
Oh, oh, wait,
you're the new man.

265
00:34:42.517 --> 00:34:45.920
Oh, Ms. Loi, you got
yourself a new buck.

266
00:34:47.922 --> 00:34:49.323
Shit.

267
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.491
- I think it's best
you be on your way.

268
00:34:53.427 --> 00:34:56.664
- I don't know who the fuck
you think you're talking to.

269
00:34:57.599 --> 00:34:58.766
- Hey.

270
00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:00.902
- Put your hands in the
air and turn around.

271
00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:03.771
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!

272
00:35:04.706 --> 00:35:07.609
Please, please.

273
00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:16.216
- Oh, you fucked up.

274
00:35:16.884 --> 00:35:18.385
You fucked up now.

275
00:35:18.452 --> 00:35:20.320
I'm the fucking law!

276
00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:25.827
- Remember, that uniform
don't mean shit around here.

277
00:35:52.452 --> 00:35:55.355
- I told you, Joe,
they weren't there.

278
00:35:56.691 --> 00:35:59.060
- Where do you
suppose they were?

279
00:35:59.127 --> 00:36:00.795
- Maybe they went somewhere.

280
00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:03.665
- Maybe the Red Coat got him.

281
00:36:05.033 --> 00:36:06.166
- Here we go.

282
00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:08.703
- You don't believe
in the Red Coat, son?

283
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.203
- You know I don't, Ma.

284
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.776
- I'd like to believe he's
out there in those mountains,

285
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:19.279
deep in the forest,
laughing at us.

286
00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.683
- Laughing at us?

287
00:36:22.382 --> 00:36:23.818
- At our bullshit.

288
00:36:24.819 --> 00:36:27.220
See, he's primal.

289
00:36:28.089 --> 00:36:29.824
Know what primal means, Dee?

290
00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:33.995
- Uh-uh.

291
00:36:34.062 --> 00:36:37.532
- It means he knows there's
only one thing that matters.

292
00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:39.399
Survival.

293
00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:40.902
- That's bullshit, Ma.

294
00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:42.369
It's fucking bullshit.

295
00:36:42.436 --> 00:36:44.237
It's a story made
up to scare kids.

296
00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:46.306
There ain't no Red
Coat out there.

297
00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.375
- Oh, he's out there, son.

298
00:36:48.442 --> 00:36:49.677
Waiting for you.

299
00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:52.479
Waiting for all of us.

300
00:36:53.447 --> 00:36:55.683
And you know what he feeds on?

301
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.684
- What?

302
00:36:58.686 --> 00:36:59.319
- Fear.

303
00:37:03.558 --> 00:37:06.894
- So, so how do
we survive, ma'am?

304
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.764
- We feed him.

305
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:36.356
- Do you drink human blood?

306
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.092
- You offering?

307
00:38:17.031 --> 00:38:18.431
- No!
- Shut up!

308
00:38:18.498 --> 00:38:19.634
- Leave me!
- Shut up!

309
00:38:20.935 --> 00:38:21.903
Get off the bed.

310
00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:23.470
- John!

311
00:38:23.538 --> 00:38:25.173
- Pull
her, grab her feet!

312
00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:26.339
Come here, whore.

313
00:38:57.839 --> 00:38:58.773
- Edward.

314
00:39:00.908 --> 00:39:01.809
Edward!

315
00:39:04.712 --> 00:39:05.378
Edward!

316
00:39:06.314 --> 00:39:07.114
- What?

317
00:39:14.421 --> 00:39:15.256
- Don't let Emily see this.

318
00:39:15.323 --> 00:39:16.456
Go.

319
00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:25.600
Sammy.

320
00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:12.880
- Emily's still asleep.

321
00:40:31.198 --> 00:40:32.800
He can't hear us.

322
00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:44.979
It's just us.

323
00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:53.187
It's just us, Mom.

324
00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:20.775
They tried to take our land.

325
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:23.577
My father went to see Reynolds.

326
00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:24.779
He murdered him.

327
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.785
His body could be anywhere.

328
00:42:32.586 --> 00:42:33.788
Mom thinks he's
still alive somewhere

329
00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:35.122
but I know he's not.

330
00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:37.691
Reynolds,

331
00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:41.695
he deserves to die.

332
00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:48.135
We need your help.

333
00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:22.062
- Is Mr. Reynolds around?

334
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:34.375
Mr. Reynolds, you have a minute?

335
00:44:35.376 --> 00:44:36.310
- Yeah.

336
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:40.247
- We got a distressed
call from your neighbor

337
00:44:40.314 --> 00:44:42.816
saying they heard
a woman screaming.

338
00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:45.520
I need to do a welfare
check on your wife.

339
00:44:45.587 --> 00:44:47.522
- Did my wife call you?

340
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:48.722
- No.

341
00:44:50.124 --> 00:44:51.492
- I guess you got no reason
to be here, Deputy Fallon.

342
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.627
- I need to speak to your wife.

343
00:44:52.693 --> 00:44:54.361
- Why?

344
00:44:54.428 --> 00:44:56.096
You wanna see what a real
American woman looks like?

345
00:44:56.864 --> 00:44:58.199
You got a warrant?

346
00:44:58.265 --> 00:44:59.601
- No.
- Great.

347
00:44:59.668 --> 00:45:00.734
Now I get the fuck
outta my face.

348
00:45:00.801 --> 00:45:02.136
- Hold up now, son.

349
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.439
That ain't no way to
treat Deputy Fallon.

350
00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:10.645
Get the good deputy here
a cold one on the house.

351
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:15.349
- No, I'm on duty.

352
00:45:16.685 --> 00:45:19.119
- You don't want a good
old-fashioned American beer?

353
00:45:19.186 --> 00:45:21.822
I guess you'd rather
have some foreign shit.

354
00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:34.768
- You English, you think
you can just walk in here

355
00:45:34.835 --> 00:45:36.837
and disrespect my
place of business

356
00:45:36.904 --> 00:45:38.806
because you're wearing a badge.

357
00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:42.009
That uniform don't
mean shit around here.

358
00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:25.185
- Father.

359
00:47:10.632 --> 00:47:12.032
We killed you.

360
00:48:55.335 --> 00:48:58.005
- You know how to use that?

361
00:48:59.908 --> 00:49:01.041
Could you?

362
00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:21.228
- That's my brother Iken,

363
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.167
and my mother, Sufal.

364
00:49:32.473 --> 00:49:36.376
She died not long
after we moved here.

365
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:43.150
She was ill so we took
her to the hospital.

366
00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:48.756
And when we went
back the next day,

367
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:54.328
a nurse came and
told me she was dead.

368
00:49:56.497 --> 00:50:01.636
And she made this tick on
her clipboard and left.

369
00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:10.277
That's who we were.

370
00:50:13.447 --> 00:50:16.149
Her telling me my
mother was dead

371
00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:22.690
was just one more
thing on a to-do list.

372
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.699
Halfway around the world

373
00:50:33.935 --> 00:50:37.204
moving from place to place,

374
00:50:37.271 --> 00:50:38.706
told to get out.

375
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:39.841
That we don't belong.

376
00:50:39.908 --> 00:50:42.209
To fuck off back to our country.

377
00:50:46.113 --> 00:50:50.585
And all
these good people

378
00:50:53.588 --> 00:50:56.591
are just trying to find
a place to call home.

379
00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:15.409
My husband was the farmer.

380
00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:21.448
This was his American dream.

381
00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:06.728
- I'll keep watch.

382
00:52:08.696 --> 00:52:09.764
You go rest.

383
00:53:07.254 --> 00:53:10.024
- We got company.
- Come on.

384
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:11.626
- Who the fuck is that?

385
00:53:11.693 --> 00:53:12.560
- John.

386
00:53:12.627 --> 00:53:14.696
- Ma, what the you doing here?

387
00:53:15.362 --> 00:53:16.864
- Load 'em on here.

388
00:53:18.198 --> 00:53:19.867
- I got this under control.

389
00:53:19.934 --> 00:53:22.036
- They're my business now, son.

390
00:53:22.103 --> 00:53:24.371
- I don't want no part of
your fucking voodoo shit.

391
00:53:24.438 --> 00:53:25.840
- Put the tailgate down.

392
00:53:29.544 --> 00:53:30.845
- I'm outta here.

393
00:53:30.912 --> 00:53:32.747
Just make sure
they're good and dead.

394
00:53:33.715 --> 00:53:36.249
- She's still breathing.
- John.

395
00:53:54.769 --> 00:53:56.236
- Give me that.

396
00:53:57.437 --> 00:54:00.575
Come on, get him out.

397
00:54:00.641 --> 00:54:02.543
- Come here.
- John.

398
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.882
- Shut the fuck up.
- Come on.

399
00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:09.382
Bring her here.

400
00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:17.457
- John.

401
00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:19.426
- Get him out.

402
00:54:19.493 --> 00:54:20.828
Out of truck.

403
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:23.865
- Come on.

404
00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:27.902
We gotta get a move on.

405
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.605
Come on.

406
00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:32.540
Pass that.

407
00:54:32.607 --> 00:54:33.541
Pass it.

408
00:54:50.258 --> 00:54:51.391
Come on.

409
00:54:52.927 --> 00:54:54.361
- Let's go.

410
00:54:54.427 --> 00:54:55.563
- It's time.

411
00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:06.607
- What the fuck is that?

412
00:55:06.674 --> 00:55:08.375
- Okay, let's leave.

413
00:55:33.034 --> 00:55:33.835
- John.

414
00:55:38.005 --> 00:55:39.006
John, John.

415
00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:44.344
John.

416
00:55:46.013 --> 00:55:47.648
John.

417
00:55:47.715 --> 00:55:48.649
John.

418
00:56:54.282 --> 00:56:55.383
- Hey!

419
00:56:55.448 --> 00:56:56.918
The hell is your problem?

420
00:56:58.786 --> 00:57:00.121
- You're my problem.

421
00:57:04.457 --> 00:57:05.826
- Hey, break it up!

422
00:57:05.893 --> 00:57:06.894
Break it up!

423
00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:10.131
- Fucking animal!

424
00:57:10.197 --> 00:57:12.600
- You two
principal's office now.

425
00:58:29.543 --> 00:58:31.045
- What happened to you?

426
00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:32.847
- Got in a fight.

427
00:58:32.913 --> 00:58:34.181
- About what?

428
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:38.285
- About a girl.

429
00:58:42.556 --> 00:58:43.991
You wouldn't understand.

430
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:49.230
How could you understand
what it's like?

431
00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:53.067
Everywhere I go in this place,

432
00:58:53.134 --> 00:58:57.004
I see their eyes watching
me, staring me down.

433
00:58:59.006 --> 00:59:00.908
None of you people can feel it.

434
00:59:01.909 --> 00:59:03.744
You're not outsiders.

435
00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.182
Of course I fucking fight.

436
00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:10.084
What else am I gonna do?

437
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:11.085
Let them win?

438
00:59:12.887 --> 00:59:14.321
- This too shall pass.

439
00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:18.092
- What the hell does that mean?

440
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:22.863
- Nothing stays the same.

441
00:59:24.098 --> 00:59:26.467
Question you gotta
ask yourself is

442
00:59:26.535 --> 00:59:30.571
when change comes your way,
how are you gonna embrace it?

443
01:00:31.265 --> 01:00:32.666
- Who the fuck is that?

444
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:35.903
Got herself a new man already?

445
01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:44.178
You wanna tell me why
you didn't mention

446
01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:46.780
the Chinaman's wife's got
a fucking house guest.

447
01:00:46.847 --> 01:00:47.915
- I didn't see anyone, Joe.

448
01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:49.350
- Don't fucking lie to me!

449
01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:51.919
- Well, he, he, he
was just some drifter,

450
01:00:51.986 --> 01:00:54.288
some tramp, all right?

451
01:00:54.355 --> 01:00:56.924
He caught me off guard
and then I, I was stupid

452
01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:58.593
and I didn't want to tell you.

453
01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:01.028
- You didn't think I already
knew you were stupid.

454
01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.930
- Well, I'm sorry, Joe.

455
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:06.333
- She don't look like
she's going nowhere.

456
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.869
And I want that fucking
vermin bitch outta here.

457
01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:10.771
- All right, well
I'll make it right.

458
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:12.173
When I go back out there,
I'll go back out there.

459
01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.874
- I want you to fucking
have some respect

460
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:16.310
and stop playing pool
like a fucking asshole

461
01:01:16.377 --> 01:01:19.847
while my good mother is
laid up in the parlor.

462
01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:22.416
I will fix it myself!

463
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:24.985
- God.

464
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.920
- Joe.

465
01:04:13.788 --> 01:04:15.590
Come over here, Joe.

466
01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:28.737
- Gimme a drink.

467
01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:33.775
- What the fuck happened
to your neck, Joe?

468
01:04:33.842 --> 01:04:35.442
- Huh?
- Your neck.

469
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.648
- Motherfucker.

470
01:04:41.816 --> 01:04:42.950
- Who did that?

471
01:04:44.084 --> 01:04:45.486
- That guy at the bitch's farm.

472
01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:48.122
- I, I ain't seen
him around before.

473
01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:52.126
He, he did tell me to
tell you something.

474
01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.361
He told me to tell you that,

475
01:04:54.428 --> 01:04:57.131
that uniform don't
mean shit around here.

476
01:04:58.198 --> 01:04:59.634
I think he was talking
about my uniform,

477
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.101
but he just kept on fucking-

478
01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:02.837
- Can I get a fucking
drink in my own bar?

479
01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:04.037
- Sorry, sir.

480
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.746
- What is this shit?

481
01:05:11.813 --> 01:05:13.046
- Your usual, sir.

482
01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:15.784
- Well open another bottle.

483
01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:49.349
- What happened?

484
01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:51.452
Is that blood on your face?

485
01:05:55.523 --> 01:05:56.457
- I fell.

486
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.196
- My mother, Ma,

487
01:06:37.966 --> 01:06:39.601
she didn't believe in heaven.

488
01:06:41.368 --> 01:06:44.304
She always said it was an
idea made up by rich people

489
01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:46.473
to keep poor people
in their place.

490
01:06:47.942 --> 01:06:52.446
But Ma believed in something
else, in this country.

491
01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:56.951
And there was a time
when that faith,

492
01:06:57.017 --> 01:07:00.354
when her faith was justified.

493
01:07:01.956 --> 01:07:04.157
A time when this
country was great.

494
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.430
When this town, when all these
towns were real communities,

495
01:07:13.267 --> 01:07:15.168
but it ain't like that no more.

496
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:18.673
The system is broke.

497
01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:23.377
Outsiders are getting
what they want free.

498
01:07:24.679 --> 01:07:29.449
And folks like me, who
belong here don't get shit.

499
01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:32.554
Our factories are closing down

500
01:07:33.855 --> 01:07:36.290
and no one can make a
living from farming no more

501
01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:38.191
because the fields are dying.

502
01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:42.396
It's as if the land done
turned its back on us.

503
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.398
And you know why?

504
01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:48.268
We are not worthy of this land.

505
01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:50.772
You are not worthy of this land.

506
01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:56.476
Men like my father,

507
01:07:58.245 --> 01:08:00.615
they made this country
into something.

508
01:08:00.682 --> 01:08:04.586
They worked that soil and
that soil was in their blood

509
01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.555
and they would've
defended that soil

510
01:08:07.622 --> 01:08:11.191
until every last drop of blood
dripped from their veins.

511
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:15.697
They were good people,
good men, strong men,

512
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:20.267
but they ain't here no more.

513
01:08:21.335 --> 01:08:22.737
Just like Ma.

514
01:08:26.574 --> 01:08:31.846
And we're left with nothing
but foreigners and fear.

515
01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:42.790
It's like, it's like we've
been poisoned and contaminated.

516
01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:49.097
It's why Ma became so
brainwashed on this
Red Coat nonsense.

517
01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:53.166
And it is nonsense,
Ma!

518
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.185
Ma stopped going to church,

519
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:15.657
especially after my
father took his own life.

520
01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:18.726
But she knew this book.

521
01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:27.635
Deliver me and rescue me
from the hands of invaders

522
01:09:27.702 --> 01:09:29.971
whose mouths are full of lies,

523
01:09:30.038 --> 01:09:33.373
whose right hands are deceitful,

524
01:09:34.441 --> 01:09:36.209
then our sons in their youth

525
01:09:36.276 --> 01:09:38.378
will be like well
nurtured plants.

526
01:09:38.445 --> 01:09:41.115
And our daughters
will be like pillars

527
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:44.719
carved to adorn a palace.

528
01:09:44.786 --> 01:09:48.089
Our barns will be filled
with every kind of provision.

529
01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:49.289
Our,

530
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:57.565
our, our sheep will increase
by thousands in our fields.

531
01:09:57.632 --> 01:10:00.668
Our oxen will draw loads.

532
01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:03.871
There will be no
breaching of walls,

533
01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:05.305
no going into captivity.

534
01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:08.676
No cry of distress
in our streets.

535
01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:16.951
Blessed are the people
of whom this is true.

536
01:10:18.418 --> 01:10:19.687
A-fucking-men.

537
01:11:19.947 --> 01:11:21.381
- You need to leave.

538
01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:23.117
- What happened?

539
01:11:23.184 --> 01:11:27.487
- You need to take your family
and pack your things and go.

540
01:11:27.555 --> 01:11:28.823
- We're not leaving.

541
01:11:29.489 --> 01:11:30.625
- Trust me.

542
01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:49.210
- And local
law enforcement agencies

543
01:11:49.277 --> 01:11:51.444
are taking them very seriously.

544
01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:53.281
We have their assurance

545
01:11:53.346 --> 01:11:55.817
that they are
actively investigating
these animal deaths

546
01:11:55.883 --> 01:11:59.086
and are exploring all
possible explanations,

547
01:11:59.153 --> 01:12:03.090
collaborating with wildlife
experts, forensic specialists,

548
01:12:03.157 --> 01:12:05.927
and even paranormal
investigators on...

549
01:12:08.428 --> 01:12:10.031
- Get outta here.

550
01:12:10.097 --> 01:12:11.032
All of you.

551
01:12:11.866 --> 01:12:13.301
You're all fucking parasites.

552
01:12:13.366 --> 01:12:14.869
Get the fuck outta here.

553
01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.772
Get the fuck outta here.

554
01:12:17.839 --> 01:12:21.742
- Hey, what's
gotten into you Joe?

555
01:12:21.809 --> 01:12:24.745
- I get something for you, Joe.

556
01:12:24.812 --> 01:12:26.747
- Go get that parasite
bitch and her family

557
01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:29.116
and bring 'em to the factory.

558
01:12:44.364 --> 01:12:45.365
- Let's get you up.

559
01:12:45.432 --> 01:12:47.500
Good girl, all right.

560
01:12:50.304 --> 01:12:51.371
- Where are we going, Mommy?

561
01:12:51.438 --> 01:12:54.208
- We are going on an adventure.

562
01:12:54.275 --> 01:12:55.343
- When's Edward back?

563
01:12:55.408 --> 01:12:56.944
- Soon.

564
01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:58.012
Okay, good.

565
01:13:40.121 --> 01:13:41.055
- Edward!

566
01:13:43.124 --> 01:13:44.058
Edward.

567
01:13:45.492 --> 01:13:47.695
They're coming for you.

568
01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:00.741
Stop!

569
01:14:02.343 --> 01:14:03.476
Stop!

570
01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:14.487
No!

571
01:14:42.383 --> 01:14:45.119
- Edward should be home by now.

572
01:14:47.421 --> 01:14:49.423
- Hey!

573
01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:21.555
- Help me.

574
01:15:33.234 --> 01:15:37.905
- No, no.

575
01:18:56.804 --> 01:19:01.875
- Goddammit.

576
01:19:05.479 --> 01:19:07.147
- Where's Reynolds?

577
01:19:08.683 --> 01:19:10.017
- He's inside.

578
01:19:11.151 --> 01:19:13.420
And something's wrong with him.

579
01:19:14.221 --> 01:19:17.258
He's not right in the head.

580
01:19:38.412 --> 01:19:39.346
- Help me.

581
01:20:23.857 --> 01:20:25.192
- Tell me where he is.

582
01:20:33.535 --> 01:20:37.838
- He took the family
to the factory.

583
01:20:44.746 --> 01:20:46.581
I know who you...

584
01:20:59.594 --> 01:21:01.028
- Fuck you!

585
01:21:08.235 --> 01:21:09.870
What's with you people?

586
01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:11.740
You're supposed to
be so damn smart,

587
01:21:11.806 --> 01:21:13.440
but you're fucking stupid.

588
01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:17.277
I told you to leave like I
told your husband to leave.

589
01:21:18.879 --> 01:21:23.283
You ain't welcome
here!

590
01:21:30.625 --> 01:21:33.193
- You gotta run, you gotta run.

591
01:21:37.565 --> 01:21:38.700
Run!

592
01:21:40.602 --> 01:21:42.670
- Get
your ass back here!

593
01:21:44.371 --> 01:21:45.906
- Shh, shh, shh.

594
01:21:54.682 --> 01:21:55.949
You're okay.

595
01:21:58.385 --> 01:22:00.522
- Get back here!

596
01:22:08.962 --> 01:22:10.164
- Shh, shh.

597
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.231
Come here, come here.

598
01:22:11.298 --> 01:22:12.166
Okay.

599
01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:14.602
You're gonna put these on.

600
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:16.170
- I'm scared, Mommy.

601
01:22:16.236 --> 01:22:18.907
Is the monster gonna kill us?

602
01:22:18.972 --> 01:22:20.775
- The monster's
not gonna kill us.

603
01:22:20.842 --> 01:22:22.242
You're gonna be safe here, okay?

604
01:22:22.309 --> 01:22:24.378
Just be really quiet.

605
01:22:26.648 --> 01:22:27.649
I love you.

606
01:22:52.941 --> 01:22:54.141
- Come out!

607
01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:57.912
You come on out!

608
01:22:57.978 --> 01:23:00.047
Or I'll gut your boy!

609
01:23:02.015 --> 01:23:05.252
- Get away from my son.

610
01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:11.325
- Your son killed my only child.

611
01:23:18.098 --> 01:23:19.299
Before I kill you,

612
01:23:20.635 --> 01:23:22.503
you're gonna watch me rip
your mother to pieces.

613
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.681
I know you.

614
01:23:34.883 --> 01:23:36.283
We killed you.

615
01:23:39.854 --> 01:23:41.054
I know you.

616
01:23:58.673 --> 01:24:00.340
- We can rest now.

617
01:24:48.088 --> 01:24:49.624
- Wait.

618
01:26:18.211 --> 01:26:20.280
- No, not here.

619
01:26:21.015 --> 01:26:22.482
Not here.

620
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.483
No, no.

621
01:26:25.953 --> 01:26:26.954
No, please.

622
01:27:25.747 --> 01:27:27.280
- John.
