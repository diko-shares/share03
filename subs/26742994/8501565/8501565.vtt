00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.232

14
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.769
(woman vocalizing)

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:18.806
(rain pattering)

16
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.782
(ominous music)

17
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.322
(voice chattering)

18
00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.802
(voice chattering)

19
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.805
(hawk screeching)

20
00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:02.182
(voice chattering)

21
00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.385
(teeth crunching)

22
00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:13.528
(dramatic music)

23
00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:25.205
- Blood, not blood in
the physical sense.

24
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:28.976
I'm talking about
blood as in kinfolk,

25
00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:32.312
your own kind, your own people,

26
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.515
who you are, what you are.

27
00:03:36.951 --> 00:03:38.653
I think that's important.

28
00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.558
You look at the world today,

29
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.460
you points your finger
anywhere on a map

30
00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:47.862
where there's trouble.

31
00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:51.498
And soon see that that
trouble is caused by people

32
00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.768
being where they
ain't supposed to be.

33
00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:57.605
Been that way, since
Moses walked the earth

34
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:03.511
and Jew boys and camel jockeys
at each other's throats,

35
00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:05.012
and they're still at it.

36
00:04:06.013 --> 00:04:08.248
Same story all through history.

37
00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.283
(knob thuds)
(water splashing)

38
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.819
People don't mix.

39
00:04:12.687 --> 00:04:16.323
Races, creeds, colors, whatever.

40
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:22.395
The so-called great melting pot.

41
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.665
I call it a great pot of shit.

42
00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:27.635
It's like oil and water.

43
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.605
And if folks don't
wake up to that soon,

44
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:33.406
mankind gonna end up
being a breed of Mongols.

45
00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:41.916
You, my friend, are very
resourceful, very industrious.

46
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.786
(lighter clicks)

47
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.656
I see you in them fields
working morning until night.

48
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.492
Some of the lazy bastards
around here should take note.

49
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.632
But it ain't about that is it?

50
00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:02.970
It's about blood and you
just ain't our blood.

51
00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:11.478
What I'm saying
is pretty simple.

52
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.915
Wouldn't the world be
a much better place

53
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.583
if people just stayed
where they were

54
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.417
and looked after their own?

55
00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:23.925
- Mr. Reynolds, I
came here tonight-

56
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.425
- You came here tonight

57
00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.063
because you're a peace
loving reasonable man,

58
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:34.434
but we ain't peace
loving reasonable people.

59
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:39.974
- This is a new deed for the
land you're squatting on.

60
00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:42.844
And this is a pen.

61
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.612
Sure being the smart
Chinaman you are,

62
00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:48.115
you can work out
what that means.

63
00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:49.917
- The bank says, as long
as I make the payments-

64
00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:52.153
- Don't matter
what the bank says.

65
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.956
What matters is that your
family will be a whole lot safer

66
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.123
after you sign that.

67
00:05:58.092 --> 00:06:00.061
- Gentlemen, please.

68
00:06:01.162 --> 00:06:03.631
I think this is best
left for another time.

69
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.100
Goodnight.

70
00:06:07.702 --> 00:06:09.436
(suspenseful music)

71
00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:10.872
(glass shattering)
(Mr. Loi groans)

72
00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:12.372
- Don't turn your
fucking back on me!

73
00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.576
(Mr. Loi panting)

74
00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:23.918
- He's still breathing.

75
00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.255
(knife thuds)
(Mr. Loi groans)

76
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:28.990
- No he ain't!

77
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.293
(knife clangs)

78
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.428
(brooding music)

79
00:06:37.798 --> 00:06:41.468
(truck engine humming)

80
00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:49.010
(gate slams)

81
00:06:51.012 --> 00:06:54.081
(truck door clicks)

82
00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:58.019
(truck door bangs)

83
00:07:22.643 --> 00:07:25.780
(hawk screeching)

84
00:07:42.863 --> 00:07:44.432
- [Danny] Good afternoon.

85
00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:47.101
I'm Danny G and this is
your local radio news.

86
00:07:47.168 --> 00:07:48.803
Our top story today,

87
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:51.471
a series of gruesome and
unexplained animal deaths

88
00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:53.307
has shaken the community here.

89
00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:54.742
Over the past several weeks,

90
00:07:54.809 --> 00:07:56.644
a growing number
of local residents

91
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.347
have reported discovering
the lifeless bodies

92
00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.082
of various animals.

93
00:08:01.148 --> 00:08:04.719
The mention of Red Coat has
been circulating among locals,

94
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.121
sparking fear and speculation.

95
00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:11.125
Red Coat is a figure from
urban legends in the area.

96
00:08:17.598 --> 00:08:19.233
(radio chattering)
(door clicks)

97
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.337
The fact that they persist,
is causing growing...

98
00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:24.605
Understandably the community is-

99
00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.374
- Hey!
- Alarmed by the.

100
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.045
(fist thuds)
(Edward groans)

101
00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:34.448
(Edward coughing)
(radio chattering)

102
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.217
- Rachel's off limits.

103
00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:40.087
And I see you
looking at her again,

104
00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:43.057
we're gonna have problems.

105
00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:50.398
(Edward coughs)
(radio chattering)

106
00:08:50.464 --> 00:08:53.467
(doors bang)

107
00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:56.537
(Edward groans)

108
00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:05.679
(birds chirping)
(melancholic music)

109
00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:34.075
(gentle music)
(clock ticking)

110
00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:43.150
(door clicks)

111
00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:45.820
(door bangs)

112
00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.527
- What happened?

113
00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:53.727
- Nothing.

114
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:56.263
- Edward.

115
00:10:06.508 --> 00:10:08.342
(door clicks)

116
00:10:08.409 --> 00:10:10.978
(door bangs)

117
00:10:17.718 --> 00:10:22.990
(wind blowing)
(brooding music)

118
00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:29.163

121
00:10:47.348 --> 00:10:50.417

125
00:11:32.393 --> 00:11:35.129
(wind blowing)

126
00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:47.875
(dog whining)

127
00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:50.945
(ominous music)

128
00:11:57.751 --> 00:12:00.421

132
00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:17.805
(ominous music)

133
00:12:18.707 --> 00:12:21.576
(lighter clicking)

134
00:12:21.643 --> 00:12:22.577
- Come on man.

135
00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:25.112
Just hold it steady.

136
00:12:25.179 --> 00:12:26.113
Hurry up.

137
00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:28.249
Hurry up, man.

138
00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.251
(wind blowing)
(lighter clicking)

139
00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:31.653
- Fuck.

140
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.820
- Come on, fucking
light it, Dee.

141
00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:34.221
- I'm trying.

142
00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:35.022
(dog barking)

143
00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:36.757
(glass shattering)

144
00:12:36.824 --> 00:12:37.692
Oh shit.

145
00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:38.892
Go, go.

146
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.095
- Who's there?

147
00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:45.266
Sammy, shh.

148
00:12:51.305 --> 00:12:53.974
(dog whining)

149
00:12:55.376 --> 00:12:56.310
Ed.

150
00:12:59.013 --> 00:13:01.882
(dog barking)

151
00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:13.927
(dog barking)
(chain clanging)

152
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:21.402
Come out.

153
00:13:25.873 --> 00:13:28.309
I said come out.

154
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:31.045
(dog barking)

155
00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:43.725

156
00:13:43.792 --> 00:13:45.492

(Yan panting)

159
00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:52.567
(dog panting)

160
00:13:52.634 --> 00:13:55.302
(dog whining)

161
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:08.849
Help me get his coat off.

162
00:14:08.916 --> 00:14:11.919
(Edward coughs)

163
00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:15.155
Lift him up.

164
00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:17.257
Come on, one, two, three.

165
00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:19.893
(Yan grunts)

166
00:14:23.798 --> 00:14:24.932
He's fine.

167
00:14:26.467 --> 00:14:28.001
He's fine, okay?

168
00:14:29.103 --> 00:14:30.304
Okay, fine.

169
00:14:38.847 --> 00:14:40.948
- Why did we bring him here?

170
00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:42.983
I mean, what if
he's the Red Coat

171
00:14:44.017 --> 00:14:45.386
or one of Reynolds's
buddies, or...

172
00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:49.123
(brooding music)

173
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.458
We can't call the police.

174
00:14:52.794 --> 00:14:54.228
So what do we do, Mom?

175
00:14:57.297 --> 00:14:58.232
Mom!

176
00:15:00.602 --> 00:15:02.837
You know, we can't trust
anyone around here.

177
00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:04.138
You know that.

178
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:11.646
- Let's keep him warm.

179
00:15:11.713 --> 00:15:13.046
Keep him comfortable.

180
00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:17.084
As soon as he's back on
his feet, we get him out.

181
00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:19.987
Okay?

182
00:15:21.488 --> 00:15:24.024
(Edward sighs)

183
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:27.094

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:38.740
(birds chirping)

188
00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:41.543
(Fallon panting)

189
00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:44.111
(leaves rustling)

190
00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:47.314
(heavy breathing)

191
00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.785
(woman vocalizing)

192
00:15:50.852 --> 00:15:53.987
(heavy breathing)

193
00:15:55.623 --> 00:15:59.126
(heavy breathing)
(liquid dripping)

194
00:15:59.193 --> 00:16:00.562
- [Man] Grab her feet!

195
00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:05.299
(woman vocalizing)
(Fallon panting)

196
00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.102
(wind blowing)
(brooding music)

197
00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:12.105
(crows cawing)

198
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:18.646
(deer snorting)

199
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:27.020
(chickens clucking)

200
00:16:32.794 --> 00:16:35.597
(clock ticking)

201
00:16:40.735 --> 00:16:43.538
(Emily humming)

202
00:16:50.979 --> 00:16:52.379
- Open please.

203
00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.017
Very good.

204
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.662
That's your medicine.

205
00:17:07.729 --> 00:17:09.096
Make sure you take it.

206
00:17:09.162 --> 00:17:11.465
And you're not
allowed out of bed.

207
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.536
- Emily, come here.

208
00:17:16.004 --> 00:17:17.805
- Mommy, you scared me.

209
00:17:17.872 --> 00:17:19.273
He's sick.

210
00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.276
- I know, but remember
we said about strangers.

211
00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:24.177
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

212
00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:26.113
He opened his eyes.

213
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:28.282
- Okay.

214
00:17:28.348 --> 00:17:29.416
Go play in your room.

215
00:17:40.662 --> 00:17:42.462
(door bangs)
(key clanging)

216
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:47.769
(ominous music)
(lock clicking)

217
00:17:48.636 --> 00:17:51.839
(chime ringing)
(brooding music)

218
00:17:51.906 --> 00:17:53.641
Emily. Ready?

219
00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:55.944
(Yan chattering)

220
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:57.077
(door bangs)

221
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.211
Gonna be late for school.

222
00:17:58.278 --> 00:17:59.514
Come on, come on, come on.

223
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:00.515
Good girl.

224
00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:04.652
(car door clicks)

225
00:18:06.153 --> 00:18:07.055
(car door bangs)

226
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.056
(car engine revving)

227
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:11.191
(car engine humming)

228
00:18:24.038 --> 00:18:29.309
(wood creaking)
(Fallon panting)

229
00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:10.384
(suspenseful music)

230
00:19:18.993 --> 00:19:20.327
(key clanging)

231
00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:23.330
(key clicks)

232
00:19:23.397 --> 00:19:26.266
(door clicks)

233
00:19:58.099 --> 00:19:59.266
- I need blood.

234
00:19:59.332 --> 00:20:02.269
(Fallon panting)

235
00:20:07.274 --> 00:20:12.547
Give me blood. (panting)

236
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.417
(door bangs)

237
00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:20.420
(crows cawing)

238
00:20:31.699 --> 00:20:33.568
- [Scott] Welcome to
Northwest Mystery,

239
00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:35.770
your source for
all things strange

240
00:20:35.837 --> 00:20:38.873
and enigmatic in the
Pacific Northwest.

241
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.340
I'm Scott.

242
00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.043
And today we're diving
deep into the world

243
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.445
of urban myths and legends
that have long captivated

244
00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:48.850
the imagination of
this city creature.

245
00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:49.984
Well done, guys.

246
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:51.686
- [Yan] Do you have any Tylenol?

247
00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:54.622
- I got Naproxen.

248
00:20:55.656 --> 00:20:57.558
That's the strongest
thing I carry.

249
00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:02.295
(door clicks)
(bell rings)

250
00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:03.430
(door bangs)

251
00:21:03.497 --> 00:21:04.966
- You're not well, Mrs. Loi.

252
00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:08.202
I know a doctor
who can hook you up

253
00:21:08.268 --> 00:21:09.971
with some Oxy if you need.

254
00:21:10.037 --> 00:21:11.105
It's good stuff.

255
00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:13.007
Make all your troubles go away.

256
00:21:13.074 --> 00:21:14.942
How's it hanging fellas?

257
00:21:15.009 --> 00:21:15.943
- Ah.

258
00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:19.714
- Throw some candy
in there too, Sam,

259
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.616
for the little girl.

260
00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:23.718
The boy too, if he likes.

261
00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:30.024
Haven't seen you around
the town much lately.

262
00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:33.728
Of course, I understand with
the everything going on.

263
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:35.797
The shame of it all.

264
00:21:36.831 --> 00:21:37.732
- Shame?

265
00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:42.036
- Your husband running
off on you like that.

266
00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:44.572
I hear it happens a
lot with you people.

267
00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:47.842
No real sense of
family or loyalty.

268
00:21:48.943 --> 00:21:51.478
Of course, saying
that, old Don here,

269
00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:54.048
when his wife got sick,

270
00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.316
he took comfort in the
arms of widow Anderson

271
00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:57.985
in the hills.

272
00:21:58.052 --> 00:21:59.921
To look at him, you wouldn't
think he had it in him,

273
00:21:59.987 --> 00:22:02.023
but he certainly had it
in her a few times a week.

274
00:22:02.089 --> 00:22:04.424
(Reynolds laughs)

275
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.093
Thankfully, all
that chasing around

276
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.896
after the widow stopped,
once Don's wife got better.

277
00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:12.365
What Don's wife don't
know won't hurt her.

278
00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:14.836
Ain't that right, Vinny?

279
00:22:16.003 --> 00:22:17.238
How's your nephew?

280
00:22:17.305 --> 00:22:18.739
You know Vinny's nephew?

281
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.108
He sells farm diesel.

282
00:22:22.543 --> 00:22:24.712
He gets it cheap on
account of his farm.

283
00:22:24.779 --> 00:22:26.581
Then he went and
turned his tanker truck

284
00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:28.381
into a rolling gas station.

285
00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:30.718
Sells at a good prices
from what I hear.

286
00:22:32.053 --> 00:22:33.554
Man's gotta make a living.

287
00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:37.124
Let him without sin
cast the first stone.

288
00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:41.028
And of course there's
Sam, Mr. Johnson.

289
00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.129
He used to like a game of cards.

290
00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.496
- That's enough.

291
00:22:51.072 --> 00:22:54.175
- I'm just painting a picture
so the Asian understands.

292
00:22:54.242 --> 00:22:58.378
You see, Mrs. Loi, this town
is, it's like a spider's web.

293
00:22:59.247 --> 00:23:01.381
Everyone's lives
all intertwined.

294
00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:02.850
The threads are real strong.

295
00:23:02.917 --> 00:23:04.886
I'm sure it's the same
in the, the village

296
00:23:04.952 --> 00:23:06.320
or whatever it
was you came from.

297
00:23:06.419 --> 00:23:08.455
- I came from a city,

298
00:23:08.522 --> 00:23:10.658
- [Reynolds] Well, a city.

299
00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:14.195
- A city with
museums and theaters

300
00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:16.564
and schools and universities.

301
00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:20.568
A city we chose to leave
behind and now I'm here.

302
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:23.638
- Yeah, you are alone.

303
00:23:26.439 --> 00:23:27.608
- You're pathetic.

304
00:23:28.609 --> 00:23:30.745
I'm not scared of you.

305
00:23:36.751 --> 00:23:38.619
- They excitable them gooks.

306
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:45.993
(door bangs)

307
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.729
You disrespect me
like that again,

308
00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:50.698
I'll cut your
fucking throat out.

309
00:23:51.632 --> 00:23:56.003
(ominous music)
(birds chirping)

310
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.006
(hawk screeching)

311
00:24:00.675 --> 00:24:03.744
(tools whirring)

312
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:09.850
(saw buzzing)

313
00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:15.189
(group chattering)
(footsteps tapping)

314
00:24:20.928 --> 00:24:23.664
What the fuck happened
at the Chinaman's place?

315
00:24:26.233 --> 00:24:27.768
- The bottle slip, Joe.

316
00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:31.038
The fucking dog started
making all kinds of ruckus.

317
00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:32.039
- Dog, huh?

318
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.675
Sounds like a dangerous animal.

319
00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:38.012
Somebody ought to report
that to the police.

320
00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:44.218
- Hey, Rach.

321
00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.721
- What do you want?

322
00:24:48.022 --> 00:24:50.191
- What's your problem?
- Get your hands off of me.

323
00:24:56.964 --> 00:24:58.498
- I'm going to see
your grandmother.

324
00:24:58.566 --> 00:24:59.834
See how she's doing.

325
00:25:04.438 --> 00:25:07.508
(brooding music)

326
00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:10.144
You know, when I was your age,

327
00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:12.880
I was learning how to
handle a branding iron.

328
00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.752
- What do you
mean, Mr. Reynolds?

329
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.655
- I mean the pain
of my burning flesh.

330
00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:26.227
That's something no
one ever forgets.

331
00:25:30.998 --> 00:25:33.801
(keys clanging)

332
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.746
(brooding music)

333
00:25:55.723 --> 00:25:58.859
(hawk screeching)

334
00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:04.298
(dog whining)

335
00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:07.234
(door clicks)

336
00:26:07.301 --> 00:26:09.236
- Do not laugh at that.

337
00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:10.438
Stay.

338
00:26:10.505 --> 00:26:12.273
(Fallon panting)

339
00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:14.608
Make sure you take it.

340
00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:16.010
Here, better.

341
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.613
(Fallon panting)

342
00:26:25.486 --> 00:26:26.287
(ominous music)
(heart beating)

343
00:26:26.353 --> 00:26:29.090
(Fallon panting)

344
00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:38.732
You stink.

345
00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:40.634
You need a bath.

346
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:42.269
- I do.
- Yeah.

347
00:26:43.737 --> 00:26:45.339
Hi, Edward.

348
00:26:46.874 --> 00:26:51.178
- The nurse here was just
making sure I'm okay.

349
00:26:55.282 --> 00:26:58.085
He's gonna go get me
something I need, okay?

350
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:02.990
I need you to get
me fresh blood.

351
00:27:04.191 --> 00:27:05.126
- What?

352
00:27:07.661 --> 00:27:09.130
- You heard me.

353
00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:11.132
- How?

354
00:27:13.434 --> 00:27:15.136
- This is a farm, isn't it?

355
00:27:15.202 --> 00:27:16.137
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.242
- So I guess you'll
figure it out.

357
00:27:23.844 --> 00:27:25.412
- Only if she comes with me.

358
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:29.783
- You wanna stay and
look after me, don't you?

359
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:30.784
- Sure thing.

360
00:27:30.851 --> 00:27:32.686
It's my vacation.

361
00:27:32.753 --> 00:27:34.321
- [Fallon] Vacation?

362
00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:37.057
- No, that isn't right.

363
00:27:37.124 --> 00:27:38.058
Vocation.

364
00:27:38.692 --> 00:27:39.894
- Vocation.

365
00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:43.731
But why don't you
check me again?

366
00:27:44.465 --> 00:27:45.399
Ah.

367
00:27:46.333 --> 00:27:49.203
(heart pounding)

368
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:01.682
(ominous music)

I'm gonna take care of the dog.

466
00:35:52.452 --> 00:35:55.355
- I told you, Joe,
they weren't there.

467
00:35:56.691 --> 00:35:59.060
- Where do you
suppose they were?

468
00:35:59.127 --> 00:36:00.795
- Maybe they went somewhere.

469
00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:03.665
- Maybe the Red Coat got him.

470
00:36:05.033 --> 00:36:06.166
- Here we go.

471
00:36:07.267 --> 00:36:08.703
- [Ma] You don't believe
in the Red Coat, son?

472
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.203
- You know I don't, Ma.

473
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.776

out there in those mountains,

474
00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:19.279
deep in the forest,
laughing at us.

475

See, he's primal.

Know what primal means, Dee?

479
00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:33.995
- Uh-uh.

480
00:36:34.062 --> 00:36:37.532
- It means he knows there's
only one thing that matters.

481
00:36:38.365 --> 00:36:39.399
Survival.

482
00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:40.902
- That's bullshit, Ma.

483
00:36:40.968 --> 00:36:42.369
It's fucking bullshit.

484
00:36:42.436 --> 00:36:44.237
It's a story made
up to scare kids.

485
00:36:44.304 --> 00:36:46.306
There ain't no Red
Coat out there.

486
00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.375

487
00:36:48.442 --> 00:36:49.677
Waiting for you.

488
00:36:50.945 --> 00:36:52.479
Waiting for all of us.

489
00:36:53.447 --> 00:36:55.683
And you know what he feeds on?

490
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:56.684
- What?

491
00:36:58.686 --> 00:36:59.319

493
00:37:03.558 --> 00:37:06.894

we survive, ma'am?

494
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:09.764

My father went to see Reynolds.

550
00:42:23.644 --> 00:42:24.779
He murdered him.

551
00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.785

still alive somewhere

553
00:42:33.854 --> 00:42:35.122
but I know he's not.

554
00:42:36.557 --> 00:42:37.691
Reynolds,

555
00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:41.695
he deserves to die.

556
00:42:46.467 --> 00:42:48.135
We need your help.

557
00:43:01.649 --> 00:43:06.921
(wood creaking)
(ominous music)

558
00:43:07.822 --> 00:43:10.758
(wind blowing)

559
00:43:12.126 --> 00:43:14.795
(owl hooting)

560
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.305
(owl hooting)

561
00:43:24.371 --> 00:43:27.775
(electricity humming)

562
00:43:30.644 --> 00:43:33.647
(ominous music)

563
00:43:52.766 --> 00:43:55.703
(game chiming)

564
00:44:07.516 --> 00:44:08.749
(dramatic music)

565
00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:09.850
(group chattering)

566
00:44:09.917 --> 00:44:11.652
(upbeat music)

567
00:44:11.719 --> 00:44:16.991
(game chiming)
(balls cracking)

568
00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:22.062
- Is Mr. Reynolds around?

569
00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:34.375
Mr. Reynolds, you have a minute?

570
00:44:35.376 --> 00:44:36.310
- Yeah.

571
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:40.247
- We got a distressed
call from your neighbor

572
00:44:40.314 --> 00:44:42.816
saying they heard
a woman screaming.

573
00:44:42.883 --> 00:44:45.520
I need to do a welfare
check on your wife.

574
00:44:45.587 --> 00:44:47.522
- Did my wife call you?

575
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:48.722
- No.

576
00:44:50.124 --> 00:44:51.492
- I guess you got no reason
to be here, Deputy Fallon.

577
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:52.627
- I need to speak to your wife.

578
00:44:52.693 --> 00:44:54.361
- Why?

579
00:44:54.428 --> 00:44:56.096
You wanna see what a real
American woman looks like?

580
00:44:56.864 --> 00:44:58.199
You got a warrant?

581
00:44:58.265 --> 00:44:59.601
- No.
- Great.

582
00:44:59.668 --> 00:45:00.734
Now I get the fuck
outta my face.

583
00:45:00.801 --> 00:45:02.136
- Hold up now, son.

584
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.439
That ain't no way to
treat Deputy Fallon.

585
00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:10.645
Get the good deputy here
a cold one on the house.

586
00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:15.349
- No, I'm on duty.

587
00:45:16.685 --> 00:45:19.119
- You don't want a good
old-fashioned American beer?

588
00:45:19.186 --> 00:45:21.822
I guess you'd rather
have some foreign shit.

589
00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:34.768
- You English, you think
you can just walk in here

590
00:45:34.835 --> 00:45:36.837
and disrespect my
place of business

591
00:45:36.904 --> 00:45:38.806
because you're wearing a badge.

592
00:45:39.873 --> 00:45:42.009
That uniform don't
mean shit around here.

593
00:45:42.076 --> 00:45:44.278
(suspenseful music)

594
00:45:44.345 --> 00:45:47.081
(upbeat music)

595
00:45:49.651 --> 00:45:52.386
(game chiming)

596
00:45:59.393 --> 00:46:02.196
(ominous music)

597
00:46:12.574 --> 00:46:13.708
(door clicks)

598
00:46:13.774 --> 00:46:16.777
(ominous music)

599
00:46:18.345 --> 00:46:21.215
(fire crackling)

600
00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:25.185
- Father.

601
00:46:28.623 --> 00:46:31.358
(Fallon panting)

602
00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:38.165
(liquid dripping)

603
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:03.490
(suspenseful music)

604
00:47:10.632 --> 00:47:12.032
We killed you.

605
00:47:21.942 --> 00:47:24.878
(game chiming)

606
00:47:27.582 --> 00:47:30.384
(ball thudding)

607
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.054
(fire crackling)

608
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.191
(voice chattering)

609
00:47:42.996 --> 00:47:46.200
(woman vocalizing)

610
00:47:51.573 --> 00:47:54.576
(voice chattering)

611
00:47:56.511 --> 00:47:59.913
(tense ominous music)

612
00:48:03.685 --> 00:48:04.952
(voice chattering)

613
00:48:05.018 --> 00:48:06.487
(dramatic music)

614
00:48:06.554 --> 00:48:12.025
(brooding music)
(electricity humming)

615
00:48:16.196 --> 00:48:19.333
(hawk screeching)

616
00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:30.477
(birds chirping)
(deer snorting)

617
00:48:31.613 --> 00:48:34.348
(wind blowing)

618
00:48:36.684 --> 00:48:39.486
(clock ticking)

619
00:48:45.894 --> 00:48:48.630
(door clicks)

620
00:48:48.696 --> 00:48:50.063
(Fallon panting)

621
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.133
(door clicking)

622
00:48:55.335 --> 00:48:58.005
- You know how to use that?

623
00:48:59.908 --> 00:49:01.041
Could you?

624
00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:21.228
- That's my brother Iken,

625
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.167
and my mother, Sufal.

626
00:49:32.473 --> 00:49:36.376
She died not long
after we moved here.

627
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:43.150
She was ill so we took
her to the hospital.

628
00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:48.756
And when we went
back the next day,

629
00:49:50.491 --> 00:49:54.328
a nurse came and
told me she was dead.

630
00:49:56.497 --> 00:50:01.636
And she made this tick on
her clipboard and left.

631
00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:10.277
That's who we were.

632
00:50:13.447 --> 00:50:16.149
Her telling me my
mother was dead

633
00:50:18.786 --> 00:50:22.690
was just one more
thing on a to-do list.

634
00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.699
Halfway around the world

635
00:50:33.935 --> 00:50:37.204
moving from place to place,

636
00:50:37.271 --> 00:50:38.706
told to get out.

637
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:39.841
That we don't belong.

638
00:50:39.908 --> 00:50:42.209
To fuck off back to our country.

639
00:50:46.113 --> 00:50:50.585
(crying) And all
these good people

640
00:50:53.588 --> 00:50:56.591
are just trying to find
a place to call home.

641
00:51:10.772 --> 00:51:15.409
My husband was the farmer.

642
00:51:19.479 --> 00:51:21.448
This was his American dream.

643
00:51:37.297 --> 00:51:40.167
(Yan exhales)

644
00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:46.306
(speaking in foreign language)

645
00:51:46.373 --> 00:51:51.012
(speaking in foreign language)

646
00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:55.282
(speaking in foreign language)

647
00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:06.728
- I'll keep watch.

648
00:52:08.696 --> 00:52:09.764
You go rest.

649
00:52:29.017 --> 00:52:33.186
(slow tempo suspenseful music)

650
00:52:35.322 --> 00:52:38.325
(door creaking)

651
00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:45.465
(medium tempo suspenseful music)

652
00:52:50.303 --> 00:52:53.306
(ominous music)

653
00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:03.483
(voice chattering)
(wood creaking)

654
00:53:03.551 --> 00:53:04.919
(suspenseful music)

655
00:53:04.986 --> 00:53:07.187
(ax thuds)

656
00:53:07.254 --> 00:53:10.024
- We got company.
- Come on.

657
00:53:10.091 --> 00:53:11.626
- Who the fuck is that?

658
00:53:11.693 --> 00:53:12.560
- [Claire] John.

659
00:53:12.627 --> 00:53:14.696
- Ma, what the you doing here?

660
00:53:15.362 --> 00:53:16.864
- Load 'em on here.

661
00:53:16.931 --> 00:53:18.132
(Claire groaning)

662
00:53:18.198 --> 00:53:19.867
- I got this under control.

663
00:53:19.934 --> 00:53:22.036
- They're my business now, son.

664
00:53:22.103 --> 00:53:24.371
- I don't want no part of
your fucking voodoo shit.

665
00:53:24.438 --> 00:53:25.840
- [Dee] Put the tailgate down.

666
00:53:25.907 --> 00:53:28.843
(Claire groaning)

667
00:53:29.544 --> 00:53:30.845
- I'm outta here.

668
00:53:30.912 --> 00:53:32.747
Just make sure
they're good and dead.

669
00:53:33.715 --> 00:53:36.249
- She's still breathing.
- John.

670
00:53:36.316 --> 00:53:39.787
(truck engine roaring)

671
00:53:41.989 --> 00:53:44.659
(crow cawing)

672
00:53:49.396 --> 00:53:52.867
(truck engine roaring)

673
00:53:52.934 --> 00:53:54.702
(truck door clicks)

674
00:53:54.769 --> 00:53:56.236
- Give me that.

675
00:53:57.437 --> 00:54:00.575
Come on, get him out.

676
00:54:00.641 --> 00:54:02.543
- Come here.
- John.

677
00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:07.882
- Shut the fuck up.
- Come on.

678
00:54:08.415 --> 00:54:09.382
Bring her here.

679
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:15.957
(Ma chattering)

680
00:54:16.023 --> 00:54:17.457
- John.

681
00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:19.426
- Get him out.

682
00:54:19.493 --> 00:54:20.828
Out of truck.

683
00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:23.865
- [Ma] Come on.

684
00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:27.902
We gotta get a move on.

685
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:30.605
Come on.

686
00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:32.540
Pass that.

687
00:54:32.607 --> 00:54:33.541
Pass it.

688
00:54:37.477 --> 00:54:40.681
(woman vocalizing)

689
00:54:50.258 --> 00:54:51.391
Come on.

690
00:54:52.927 --> 00:54:54.361
- [Dee] Let's go.

691
00:54:54.427 --> 00:54:55.563
- It's time.

692
00:55:03.403 --> 00:55:04.672
(truck door bangs)

693
00:55:04.739 --> 00:55:06.607
- [Dee] What the fuck is that?

694
00:55:06.674 --> 00:55:08.375
- [Ma] Okay, let's leave.

695

John, John.

702
00:55:41.242 --> 00:55:43.144

The hell is your problem?

(body thuds)

721
00:57:04.457 --> 00:57:05.826
- Hey, break it up!

722
00:57:05.893 --> 00:57:06.894
Break it up!

723
00:57:08.763 --> 00:57:10.131
- Fucking animal!

724
00:57:10.197 --> 00:57:12.600

principal's office now.

- [Fallon] What happened to you?

736
00:58:31.779 --> 00:58:32.847

(ax thuds)

739
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:38.285
- About a girl.

740
00:58:40.187 --> 00:58:41.288
(Fallon sighs)

741
00:58:41.355 --> 00:58:42.490
(ax thuds)
(wood cracks)

742
00:58:42.556 --> 00:58:43.991
You wouldn't understand.

743
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:49.230
How could you understand
what it's like?

744
00:58:51.065 --> 00:58:53.067
Everywhere I go in this place,

745
00:58:53.134 --> 00:58:57.004
I see their eyes watching
me, staring me down.

746
00:58:59.006 --> 00:59:00.908
None of you people can feel it.

747
00:59:01.909 --> 00:59:03.744
You're not outsiders.

748
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.614
(ax thuds)
(wood cracks)

749
00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.182
Of course I fucking fight.

750
00:59:08.849 --> 00:59:10.084
What else am I gonna do?

751
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:11.085
Let them win?

752
00:59:12.887 --> 00:59:14.321
- This too shall pass.

753
00:59:16.457 --> 00:59:18.092
- What the hell does that mean?

754
00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:22.863
- Nothing stays the same.

755
00:59:24.098 --> 00:59:26.467
Question you gotta
ask yourself is

756
00:59:26.535 --> 00:59:30.571
when change comes your way,
how are you gonna embrace it?

757
01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:03.971
(Reynolds crying)

758
01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:18.752
(engine rumbling)

759
01:00:31.265 --> 01:00:32.666
- Who the fuck is that?

760
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:35.903
Got herself a new man already?

761
01:00:39.574 --> 01:00:40.374
(game chiming)
(group chattering)

762
01:00:40.441 --> 01:00:42.309
(balls thudding)

763
01:00:42.376 --> 01:00:44.178
You wanna tell me why
you didn't mention

764
01:00:44.245 --> 01:00:46.780
the Chinaman's wife's got
a fucking house guest.

765
01:00:46.847 --> 01:00:47.915
- I didn't see anyone, Joe.

766
01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:49.350
- Don't fucking lie to me!

767
01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:51.919
- Well, he, he, he
was just some drifter,

768
01:00:51.986 --> 01:00:54.288
some tramp, all right?

769
01:00:54.355 --> 01:00:56.924
He caught me off guard
and then I, I was stupid

770
01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:58.593
and I didn't want to tell you.

771
01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:01.028
- You didn't think I already
knew you were stupid.

772
01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.930
- [Dee] Well, I'm sorry, Joe.

773
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:06.333
- She don't look like
she's going nowhere.

774
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.869
And I want that fucking
vermin bitch outta here.

775
01:01:08.936 --> 01:01:10.771
- All right, well
I'll make it right.

776
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:12.173
When I go back out there,
I'll go back out there.

777
01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:13.874
- I want you to fucking
have some respect

778
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:16.310
and stop playing pool
like a fucking asshole

779
01:01:16.377 --> 01:01:19.847
while my good mother is
laid up in the parlor.

780
01:01:19.914 --> 01:01:21.282
(stick thudding)

781
01:01:21.348 --> 01:01:22.416
I will fix it myself!

782
01:01:22.483 --> 01:01:23.984
(door bangs)

783
01:01:24.051 --> 01:01:24.985
- God.

784
01:01:27.121 --> 01:01:32.393
(crow cawing)
(sheets rustling)

785
01:01:32.927 --> 01:01:35.362
(ominous music)

786
01:01:38.499 --> 01:01:41.368
(dirt crinkling)

787
01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:50.110
(suspenseful music)

788
01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:52.379
(fist thuds)

789
01:01:52.446 --> 01:01:55.249
(fist thudding)

790
01:01:57.384 --> 01:01:58.852
(fist thuds)

791
01:01:58.919 --> 01:02:00.955
(teeth crunch)

792
01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:05.025
(slow tempo brooding music)

793
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.432
(screen whooshes)

794
01:02:12.733 --> 01:02:14.603
(screen whooshes)
(ominous music)

795
01:02:14.669 --> 01:02:17.972
(heavy breathing)

796
01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:21.242
(liquid squishing)

797
01:02:23.511 --> 01:02:25.346
(liquid whooshing)

798
01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:27.815
(water rustling)

799
01:02:27.881 --> 01:02:29.250
(dramatic music)

800
01:02:29.316 --> 01:02:32.386
(ominous music)
(teeth crunching)

801
01:02:32.453 --> 01:02:34.288
(liquid squishing)

802
01:02:34.355 --> 01:02:37.424
(suspenseful music)

803
01:02:38.693 --> 01:02:41.161
(ominous music)
(Fallon whimpering)

804
01:02:41.228 --> 01:02:46.500
(voice chattering)
(heart pounding)

805
01:02:58.345 --> 01:03:01.282
(flesh squishing)

806
01:03:02.016 --> 01:03:05.152
(teeth crunching)

807
01:03:14.261 --> 01:03:15.597
(screen whooshing)
(crows cawing)

808
01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:20.401
(river babbling)
(Fallon panting)

809
01:03:25.406 --> 01:03:29.343
(insects chirping)
(ominous music)

810
01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:30.878
(sticks cracking)

811
01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:34.081
(hawk screeching)

812
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.920
- [Ma] Joe.

813
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.800
(hawk screeching)
(Reynolds retching)

814
01:03:51.865 --> 01:03:55.135
(insects squishing)

815
01:03:57.071 --> 01:04:00.207
(hawk screeching)

816
01:04:13.788 --> 01:04:15.590
Come over here, Joe.

817
01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:22.296
(hawk screeching)

818
01:04:26.333 --> 01:04:27.868
(brooding music)

819
01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:28.737
- Gimme a drink.

820
01:04:28.803 --> 01:04:31.405
(upbeat music)

821
01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:33.775
- What the fuck happened
to your neck, Joe?

822
01:04:33.842 --> 01:04:35.442
- Huh?
- Your neck.

823
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:38.245
(game chiming)

824
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.648
- Motherfucker.

825
01:04:41.816 --> 01:04:42.950
- Who did that?

826
01:04:44.084 --> 01:04:45.486
- That guy at the bitch's farm.

827
01:04:45.553 --> 01:04:48.122
- I, I ain't seen
him around before.

828
01:04:49.356 --> 01:04:52.126
He, he did tell me to
tell you something.

829
01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.361
He told me to tell you that,

830
01:04:54.428 --> 01:04:57.131
that uniform don't
mean shit around here.

831
01:04:58.198 --> 01:04:59.634
I think he was talking
about my uniform,

832
01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.101
but he just kept on fucking-

833
01:05:01.168 --> 01:05:02.837
- Can I get a fucking
drink in my own bar?

834
01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:04.037
- Sorry, sir.

835
01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:10.144
(Reynolds spits)

836
01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:11.746
- What is this shit?

837
01:05:11.813 --> 01:05:13.046
- Your usual, sir.

838
01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:15.784
- Well open another bottle.

839
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.919
(brooding music)

840
01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:24.592
(crows cawing)

841
01:05:29.463 --> 01:05:32.199
(crows cawing)

842
01:05:39.072 --> 01:05:40.941
(door clicks)

843
01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:46.280
(birds chirping)
(Fallon coughing)

844
01:05:48.015 --> 01:05:49.349
- What happened?

845
01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:51.452
Is that blood on your face?

846
01:05:51.519 --> 01:05:52.453
(ominous music)

847
01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.456
(heart pounding)
(clock ticking)

848
01:05:55.523 --> 01:05:56.457
- I fell.

849
01:06:01.228 --> 01:06:06.500
(door clicks)
(dramatic music)

850
01:06:14.509 --> 01:06:17.612
(leaves rustling)
(ominous music)

851
01:06:17.679 --> 01:06:19.012
(owl cooing)

852
01:06:19.079 --> 01:06:22.216
(hawk screeching)

853
01:06:25.587 --> 01:06:31.058
(wings flapping)
(church bell ringing)

854
01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.196
- My mother, Ma,

855
01:06:37.966 --> 01:06:39.601
she didn't believe in heaven.

856
01:06:41.368 --> 01:06:44.304
She always said it was an
idea made up by rich people

857
01:06:44.371 --> 01:06:46.473
to keep poor people
in their place.

858
01:06:47.942 --> 01:06:52.446
But Ma believed in something
else, in this country.

859
01:06:54.949 --> 01:06:56.951
And there was a time
when that faith,

860
01:06:57.017 --> 01:07:00.354
when her faith was justified.

861
01:07:01.956 --> 01:07:04.157
A time when this
country was great.

862
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.430
When this town, when all these
towns were real communities,

863
01:07:13.267 --> 01:07:15.168
but it ain't like that no more.

864
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:18.673
The system is broke.

865
01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:23.377
Outsiders are getting
what they want free.

866
01:07:24.679 --> 01:07:29.449
And folks like me, who
belong here don't get shit.

867
01:07:30.384 --> 01:07:32.554
Our factories are closing down

868
01:07:33.855 --> 01:07:36.290
and no one can make a
living from farming no more

869
01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:38.191
because the fields are dying.

870
01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:42.396
It's as if the land done
turned its back on us.

871
01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:44.398
And you know why?

872
01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:48.268
We are not worthy of this land.

873
01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:50.772
You are not worthy of this land.

874
01:07:51.973 --> 01:07:54.207
(group chattering)

875
01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:56.476
Men like my father,

876
01:07:58.245 --> 01:08:00.615
they made this country
into something.

877
01:08:00.682 --> 01:08:04.586
They worked that soil and
that soil was in their blood

878
01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.555
and they would've
defended that soil

879
01:08:07.622 --> 01:08:11.191
until every last drop of blood
dripped from their veins.

880
01:08:12.359 --> 01:08:15.697
They were good people,
good men, strong men,

881
01:08:18.465 --> 01:08:20.267
but they ain't here no more.

882
01:08:21.335 --> 01:08:22.737
Just like Ma.

883
01:08:26.574 --> 01:08:31.846
And we're left with nothing
but foreigners and fear.

884
01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:42.790
It's like, it's like we've
been poisoned and contaminated.

885
01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:49.097
It's why Ma became so
brainwashed on this
Red Coat nonsense.

886
01:08:49.162 --> 01:08:53.166
And it is nonsense,
Ma! (panting)

887
01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:59.306
(Reynolds coughing)
(group chattering)

888
01:08:59.373 --> 01:09:02.242
(Reynolds panting)

889
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.185
Ma stopped going to church,

890
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:15.657
especially after my
father took his own life.

891
01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:18.726
But she knew this book.

892
01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:27.635
Deliver me and rescue me
from the hands of invaders

893
01:09:27.702 --> 01:09:29.971
whose mouths are full of lies,

894
01:09:30.038 --> 01:09:33.373
whose right hands are deceitful,

895
01:09:34.441 --> 01:09:36.209
then our sons in their youth

896
01:09:36.276 --> 01:09:38.378
will be like well
nurtured plants.

897
01:09:38.445 --> 01:09:41.115
And our daughters
will be like pillars

898
01:09:41.181 --> 01:09:44.719
carved to adorn a palace.

899
01:09:44.786 --> 01:09:48.089
Our barns will be filled
with every kind of provision.

900
01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:49.289
Our,

901
01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:57.565
our, our sheep will increase
by thousands in our fields.

902
01:09:57.632 --> 01:10:00.668
Our oxen will draw loads.

903
01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:03.871
There will be no
breaching of walls,

904
01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:05.305
no going into captivity.

905
01:10:05.372 --> 01:10:08.676
No cry of distress
in our streets.

906
01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:16.951
Blessed are the people
of whom this is true.

907
01:10:18.418 --> 01:10:19.687
A-fucking-men.

908
01:10:21.155 --> 01:10:23.825
(Reynolds panting)

909
01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:37.905
(suspenseful music)

910
01:10:37.972 --> 01:10:39.107
(screen whooshes)

911
01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:44.344
(clock ticking)
(keys clicking)

912
01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:19.881
(button clicks)
(gentle music)

913
01:11:19.947 --> 01:11:21.381
- You need to leave.

914
01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:23.117
- What happened?

915
01:11:23.184 --> 01:11:27.487
- You need to take your family
and pack your things and go.

916
01:11:27.555 --> 01:11:28.823
- We're not leaving.

917
01:11:29.489 --> 01:11:30.625
- Trust me.

918
