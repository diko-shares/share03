<i>His family was not rich

<i>In fact, they barely had enough to eat.</i>

6

<i>Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.</i>

-A head for Willy Wonka.

-Think so?

25
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.161

of making chocolate ice cream...

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.712
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

921

...then reassemble it

You don't understand anything

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:23.285
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles. Duh.

930
01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:27.039
Second, the amount of power it
would take to convert energy in matter...

931
01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:28.999
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

Bring in the chocolate.

938
01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:12.334
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

939
01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:15.879
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

940
01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.464
Same basic principle.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:14.146

947
01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:16.815
Oh, look.

948
01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.613
-Take it.
-It's just a picture on a screen.

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:25.824
Scaredy-cat.

950
01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:27.492
You take it.

951
01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.620
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

952
01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.297
Go on.

953
01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.140

954
01:27:53.143 --> 01:27:55.270
Eat it. Go on.

955
01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.606
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

956
01:27:57.773 --> 01:28:01.067
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

957
01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:10.911
It's great.

958
01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.454
It's a miracle.

959
01:28:14.247 --> 01:28:17.083
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

960
01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:21.004
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

961
01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:25.258
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

962
01:28:25.425 --> 01:28:28.345
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself."

963
01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:32.933
And you simply reach out and take it.

964
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.143
How about that?

965
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:37.229
So can you send other things?

966
01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.189
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

967
01:28:39.564 --> 01:28:42.150
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal’s made of?

968
01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.654
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

969
01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:47.948
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

970
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.242
-Of course I could.
-What about people?

971
01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:54.120
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

972
01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:57.499
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

973
01:28:57.707 --> 01:29:00.669
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

974
01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:03.004

01:29:04.589 --> 01:29:07.342

what he's talking about.

977
01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:09.928
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

978
01:29:10.095 --> 01:29:12.222
You think he's a genius,
but he's an idiot.

979
01:29:13.139 --> 01:29:14.891
But I'm not.

980
01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:21.106
Hey, little boy.

981
01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.109
Don't push my button.

982
01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:06.943
He's gone.

983
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.905
Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

984
01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.450
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

985
01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:14.868
What do you mean?

986
01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:19.748
Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

987
01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:24.377
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

988
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.588
What kind of a question is that?

989
01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.467
No need to snap. Just a question.

990
01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:34.262

I've got transport--

1186
01:44:09.702 --> 01:44:12.997
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

1187
01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:45.863
I think we've got the wrong house.

1189
01:45:00.419 --> 01:45:01.879
Do you have an appointment?

1190
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:04.548
No. But he's overdue.

1191
01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.845
Open.

1192
01:45:10.846 --> 01:45:15.768
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

1193
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:57.852
Heavens.

1194
01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:01.188
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

1195
01:46:05.234 --> 01:46:07.111
Since...

1196
01:46:16.328 --> 01:46:17.621
Willy?

1197
01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:20.916
Hi, Dad.

1198
01:46:31.927 --> 01:46:34.179
All these years...

1199
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:37.057
...and you haven't flossed.

1200
01:46:39.143 --> 01:46:40.978
Not once.

<i>NARRATOR:
It was on this day...</i>

1202
01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:10.299
<i>...that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...</i>

1203

<i>...who accepted on one condition.</i>

1204
01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:15.679
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.

1205
01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:17.806
Thought I heard thunder.

1206
01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:21.602
-You staying for dinner, Willy?
-Yes, please.

1207
01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:24.188
I'll shuffle the plates.

1208
01:47:32.738 --> 01:47:36.033
You smell like peanuts.

1209
01:47:36.408 --> 01:47:39.787
-I love peanuts.
-Oh, thank you.

1210
01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:41.622
You smell like...

1211
01:47:41.789 --> 01:47:43.624
...old people and soap.

1212
01:47:46.502 --> 01:47:48.212
I like it.

1213
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.302
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1214
01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:57.846
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

1215
01:47:58.013 --> 01:47:59.556
With licorice instead of string.

1216
01:48:00.641 --> 01:48:04.144
-Boys, no business at the dinner table.
-Sorry, Mom.

1217
01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:07.731
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

<i>Life had never been sweeter.</i>
